It\r\nconsists mainly of translations of early Spanish books and manuscripts.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to note that this is the first publication by the\r\nMuseum based upon the large collection of photographic reproductions of\r\nearly manuscripts from Mexico and Central America brought together by\r\nProfessor W. E. Gates of Point Loma, California, and presented to the\r\nMuseum by Mr. Charles P. Bowditch. Among these manuscripts is\r\nAvendano's account of his journey to Peten, the greater part of which\r\nis included in the present paper. The original of this manuscript is in\r\nthe British Museum. Cano's account of a trip to Guatemala is also given\r\nhere. This manuscript is in the Brinton Collection at the University of\r\nPennsylvania. It is through the kindness of Dr. George B. Gordon,\r\nDirector of that Museum, and of Miss Adela C. Breton, who copied the\r\nmanuscript, that it is possible to publish it at this time. The\r\nAvendano and the Cano manuscripts were translated by Mr. Bowditch and\r\nSenor G. Rivera.\r\n\r\n                                       CHARLES C. WILLOUGHBY\r\n                                                        _Director_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the library of the Peabody Museum of Harvard University there is an\r\ninvaluable collection of photographs of old manuscripts relating to\r\nMiddle America. These photographs, made by Professor William E. Gates\r\nof Point Loma, California, were given to the Peabody Museum by Charles\r\nP. Bowditch, Esq., of Boston. One of the volumes contains a\r\nphotographic reproduction of an original manuscript entitled _Relacion\r\nde las dos Entradas que hize a Peten Ytza_. The author, Fray Andres de\r\nAvendano y Loyola, of the Order of Saint Francis, will receive much of\r\nour attention later. Fortunately Mr. Bowditch and Sr. Guillermo Rivera\r\nhave deciphered and translated the crabbed old text, so that we have at\r\nhand an account of the subjection of the Itzas of Tayasal, or Peten\r\nItza, which is not only invaluable as being the work of an eyewitness\r\nof that subjection, but which also is filled with a rare charm. It was\r\nlargely with a view to bringing this old manuscript to the attention of\r\nstudents that Mr. Bowditch and Dr. Tozzer asked me to work it up into a\r\nstudy of the Itzas of Tayasal. At the same time we must not neglect to\r\nnotice here the translation, made by Mr. Bowditch and Sr. Rivera, of\r\nanother inedited work on the same subject. I refer to the account by\r\nFray Alonso Cano, which will be of great use to us later.\r\n\r\nThough Avendano and Cano are, so to speak, the prime reasons for the\r\nwriting of this study, they have been supplemented in no inconsiderable\r\ndegree by two other early Spanish writers on the history of Yucatan and\r\nits people, Diego Cogolludo and Juan de Villagutierre y Sotomayor. A\r\nfew comments on the works of these two authors will later prove useful\r\nto the reader.\r\n\r\nThough Villagutierre's Spanish style is far superior to that of such\r\nwriters as Fernando Montesinos and Antonio de la Calancha, it is,\r\nnevertheless, atrocious. Although he wrote about 1700, Villagutierre's\r\nstyle is excessively archaic; his grammatical construction can hardly\r\nbe called construction at all, so formless and ambiguous is it.\r\nVillagutierre never hesitates to write several long sentences without a\r\nsingle main verb between them, nor does he often refrain from going on\r\nand on for a page or so without using a period. In the use of capitals\r\nhe is most whimsical; usually he has them when they are called for, but\r\nhe has many that are out of place as well.\r\n\r\nThe style of Cogolludo, on the other hand, is very good, and that, be\r\nit noted, despite the fact that Cogolludo wrote prior to 1688. One\r\nremarks with considerable surprise that in several cases Villagutierre\r\nand Cogolludo use almost the same words. For example, in speaking of\r\nthe visit which Cortes made to the island of Tayasal, Cogolludo says:\r\n\"... _y aun la ida de Cortes se tuvo por ossadia, y demasiada\r\nconfianza...._\" Villagutierre, in the same connection says: \"... _que\r\nlo tenian a grandissima temeridad, y ossadia, y por demasiada\r\nconfianza...._\" This is an interesting point, and perhaps it is\r\nsignificant that Cogolludo's book was published in 1688, whereas that\r\nof Villagutierre was not brought out until 1701. It is to be noted that\r\nCogolludo, the earlier writer, uses only two epithets, and that\r\nVillagutierre, the later writer, uses the same two, plus a new one of\r\nhis own. I know of two other cases where equally close and significant\r\nsimilarity exists between the two. It is possible, then, that\r\nVillagutierre copied (not to say plagiarized) the work of Cogolludo\r\nwithout giving credit for it. But the important point for us in this\r\nmatter does not concern the personal integrity of Villagutierre. Rather\r\ndoes the importance of the matter lie in this: if Villagutierre was\r\nacquainted with the history of Yucatan by Cogolludo to such a degree\r\nthat he frequently borrowed whole phrases from it, he must have had a\r\nvery good reason for diverging widely now and again from the version of\r\nevents given by Cogolludo. Such a reason could only be supplied by the\r\nfact that Villagutierre possessed information which he regarded as\r\nsuperior to and more official than that of Cogolludo. Therefore, since\r\nin several instances (as in his account of the events leading up to the\r\nvisit of Cortes to Tayasal) Villagutierre occasionally departs from the\r\nfootsteps of Cogolludo, we may safely assume that he was at once more\r\ncritical and better informed than the latter, whom, however, he valued\r\nenough to be willing to draw from his work much of his information and\r\neven some of his phraseology.\r\n\r\nThe virtues and defects of Avendano and of Cano are less subtle; so\r\nmuch so, indeed, that it would be absurd to attempt a criticism of them\r\nhere. The reader will have ample opportunity to see their qualities for\r\nhimself in the body of the book.\r\n\r\nA word as to the method adopted in translating is in order. In the\r\nvarious passages taken from Cogolludo and Villagutierre I have\r\npreserved the spelling and capitalization of proper names that appear\r\nin the text. All passages from Avendano and Cano are from the\r\ntranslations made by Mr. Bowditch and Sr. Rivera.\r\n\r\nAll the other works used are so well known that comment on them is\r\nsuperfluous.\r\n\r\nFinally, I wish to express my gratitude to Mr. Bowditch and to Dr.\r\nTozzer, both of whom have spent much time and thought in going over the\r\nmanuscript of this work. Among the others who have shown me kindness\r\nand courtesy during the preparation of this study are Mr. Putnam of the\r\nLibrary of Congress; Dr. George Byron Gordon of the University Museum,\r\nPhiladelphia; Professor Holmes of the United States National Museum;\r\nDr. Edward Luther Stevenson of the Hispanic Society of America, New\r\nYork; and, lastly, my mother, Mrs. James Means. These and others have\r\ngenerously given me much of their time and information.\r\n\r\n                                            PHILIP AINSWORTH MEANS\r\n\r\nFebruary 23, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           TABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                 THE PRE-COLUMBIAN HISTORY OF THE MAYAS\r\n                      AND OF THE ITZAS, 1445\r\n\r\n  Migratory period\r\n  The Golden Age or Old Empire of the Maya\r\n  The Colonization period\r\n  Transitional period\r\n  Renaissance or League period\r\n  The period of the Toltec mercenaries\r\n  Disintegration\r\n      Note: Cogolludo's account of the early history of the Mayas and\r\n        of some of their customs\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n          THE POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES OF\r\n             THE ITZA STATE DURING THE PERIOD OF 1445-1697\r\n\r\n  The significance of the Itzas\r\n  The location of Peten or Tayasal\r\n  Description of Peten and its surroundings\r\n  The lake neither rises nor falls\r\n  The temples of Tayasal described by Avendano\r\n  The palace of Canek, Chief of the Itzas\r\n  The districts of Peten Itza\r\n  Extent of the Itza dominion under the Chief Canek\r\n  Quincanek\r\n  Further information about the region\r\n  The Itzas described\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n           THE FIRST SPANISH ENTRADAS INTO YUCATAN, 1517-1526\r\n\r\n  The first Spaniards in Yucatan\r\n  Francisco Hernandez de Cordoba, 1517\r\n  Juan de Grijalva and others, 1518\r\n  Cortes in Mexico, 1519\r\n  Villagutierre's account of the entrada of Cortes, 1524-1525\r\n  Cortes starts for Honduras\r\n  Cortes arrives at Izancanac\r\n  Description of a large town\r\n  The Spaniards suspect treachery\r\n  The Indians explain why their town was deserted\r\n  Cortes takes leave of them in a friendly spirit\r\n  The deer hunt\r\n  The army of Cortes proceeds on its way\r\n  The lake\r\n  They capture an Indian\r\n  The Indian is sent to Tayasal\r\n  Some Indians come to Cortes from Tayasal\r\n  Canek himself comes and is courteously received\r\n  Canek hears Mass and promises to put away his idols\r\n  Cortes goes to Tayasal with Canek\r\n  The Itzas give Cortes news of Olid\r\n  Cortes takes leave of Canek, leaving Morzillo\r\n  Idols not burnt\r\n  Cortes arrives in Honduras\r\n  Comparison of Villagutierre with other authorities\r\n  Canek's attitude toward Cortes\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n         THE ENTRADA OF FRANCISCO DE MONTEJO AND HIS SON,\r\n          AND THE ARRIVAL OF THE FRANCISCANS, 1526-1542\r\n\r\n  Francisco de Montejo and his son\r\n  Montejo's preparations and sacrifices\r\n  He sets out\r\n  Montejo and his men go along the shore of Yucatan\r\n  Description of the campaign\r\n  Davila and Vazquez search vainly for gold in the region of Chetemal\r\n  Foundation of Villa Real de Chetemal\r\n  Hardships of those who were at Chichen\r\n  Continual misfortunes\r\n  Chichen Itza and Villa Real both deserted\r\n  Davila goes to Honduras\r\n  The Elder Montejo goes to Tabasco in 1535\r\n  The Franciscans enter Yucatan, 1535\r\n  Renewal of the subjection of Yucatan by Montejo, 1537\r\n  Hostility of the Indians\r\n  The Elder Montejo's instructions to his son\r\n  The Younger Montejo founds Campeche, 1540-1541\r\n  Tutul Xiu of Mani offers his aid\r\n  Foundation of Merida and of Valladolid, 1542-1543\r\n  Bishop Bartolome de las Casas arrives in Yucatan\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n           THE ENTRADA OF PADRES FUENSALIDA AND ORBITA, 1618\r\n\r\n  The name Canek\r\n  Increased power of the Itzas\r\n  The mock embassy from Tayasal\r\n  The mock embassy considered to be a rebellion\r\n  A new period in the history of the Itzas\r\n  Fuensalida and Orbita\r\n  Preliminaries to the departure of the Padres\r\n  Briceno's opposition\r\n  The Padres set out\r\n  Their route\r\n  The journey up the river from Tipu\r\n  Arrival at Tipu\r\n  Events at the village of Tipu\r\n  The friendliness of Carrillo and the Indians\r\n  Don Christoval Na, Cacique of the Indians of Tipu\r\n  Francisco Cumux goes with an embassy to Canek\r\n  Cumux returns from Canek with two chiefs of Tayasal\r\n  The two chiefs are cordially received\r\n  The Padres prepare to travel to Tayasal\r\n  Delays;

That branch of the Mayas\r\nwho called themselves the Itzas and who form the chief subject of this\r\nwork occupied the southern portion of Yucatan and the greater part of\r\nwhat is now the Department of Peten in Guatemala.\r\n\r\nA few decades ago it was the fashion to credit the aboriginal peoples\r\nof America with a civilization of enormous antiquity. But the whole\r\ntrend of modern scientific investigation tends to prove that the\r\nAmerican continent was one of the last parts of the world to be settled\r\nand that, at the time of the Spanish conquest, the aboriginal cultures\r\nwere certainly not more than three thousand or so years old. Even this\r\nestimate should be understood to include centuries of migratory\r\nshiftings and centuries of development along lines which eventually led\r\nto the erection of the earlier types of high culture in Middle and\r\nSouth America. Roughly speaking, the time of Christ coincides with the\r\nperiod at which the earliest high cultures in this hemisphere began to\r\nflourish.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of convenience we shall follow the chronology suggested by\r\nMr. Morley (1915) and divide the pre-Columbian history of the Maya race\r\ninto eight periods. The first seven of these periods we shall discuss\r\nbriefly in this opening chapter; the eighth will furnish the subject\r\nmatter for the remainder of the book. The dates given should be\r\nregarded as merely approximate.\r\n\r\n                                           APPROXIMATE DATES PERIODS\r\n  PERIODS                                             A.D.\r\n\r\n  I     Migratory period                                 ?-200\r\n  II    Golden Age or Old Empire                       200-600\r\n  III   Colonization period                            450-700\r\n  IV    Transitional period                           700-1000\r\n  V     Renaissance or League period                 1000-1200\r\n  VI    The period of the Toltec mercenaries         1200-1450\r\n  VII   Disintegration                               1450-1541\r\n  VIII  Period of wars with Spain                    1519-1697\r\n\r\nBefore taking up our review of the first seven periods we must remind\r\nourselves that the prehistoric cultures of Middle America have a\r\ncertain unity, showing beyond doubt that they were all of a common\r\norigin. It is impossible to tell at what epoch the Maya became separate\r\nand distinct from the other highly cultured peoples scattered over\r\nMexico and Central America. Fortunately, however, owing to the\r\ninvestigations in the Valley of Mexico, we have abundant material for\r\nthe reconstruction of the sequence of cultures. Three successive strata\r\nof occupation have been found in the Valley of Mexico. The earliest of\r\nthese, the Archaic, is also found in many other places throughout\r\nMexico and Central America. There is some reason to suppose that this\r\nculture was at one time fairly uniform throughout the greater part of\r\nMiddle America. The local developments seen in the Maya, the Zapotec,\r\nand the early Mexican cultures may have been the result of\r\nmodifications of the Archaic culture. Above this Archaic stratum in the\r\nValley of Mexico is found the Toltec or Teotihuacan culture. This is\r\nsynchronous with late Maya of the sixth period on our table.\r\nManifestations of its art are found in the latest buildings at Chichen\r\nItza.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Migratory Period (?-200 A.D.). The two earliest dated Maya\r\ninscriptions that we have are those on the Tuxtla statuette and on the\r\nLeyden plate. (Morley, 1915, p. 194 ff.; Holmes, 1916.) The former is\r\ndated, in the Maya system of chronology, 8.6.2.4.17. (about 100 B.C.);\r\nthe date on the latter is 8.14.3.1.12. (about 50 A.D.).[1] Although, as\r\nMr. Morley points out, these are the earliest dates we know of from the\r\nMaya area, it is to be noted that they do not differ essentially from\r\nthe more recent inscriptions. They ought, therefore, to be regarded as\r\nintroductory to the historic period, and it may be assumed that they\r\nwere themselves preceded by many decades of development during which\r\nthe first attempts at writing were gradually elaborated until the\r\nextremely complex Maya hieroglyphics were evolved in the form in which\r\nwe know them.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The Golden Age or Old Empire of the Maya (200-600 A.D.). This\r\nperiod extended, roughly, from 9.2.10.0.0. (210) to 10.2.0.0.0. (600).\r\nIn this time many cities rose, flourished, and fell. Of these Palenque,\r\nYaxchilan, Piedras Negras, Tikal, Seibal, Quirigua, Copan, and Nakum\r\nare some of the more important. Like Seibal on the east and Piedras\r\nNegras and Yaxchilan on the west, Tikal and Nakum were not far from the\r\nPeten region to which our attention will be chiefly directed.[2]\r\nIndeed, Lake Peten lies in what is almost the geographical center of\r\nthe area formerly occupied by the Old Empire. It is significant,\r\ntherefore, that Mr. Morley has found at the modern town of Flores (in\r\nLake Peten) two stelae dated approximately 10.1.0.0.0. and 10.2.0.0.0.\r\n(580 and 600).\r\n\r\nThe various elaborate architectural features of the Old Empire cities\r\nhave been fully examined by many writers, and it is, therefore,\r\nneedless for us to speak of them except in the most general terms. One\r\npredominating feature of all the ruins is the excessive use of\r\nornamentation. Because the country was devoid of any great natural\r\nelevations which would give an effective setting for their buildings,\r\nthe people often used substructures of varying heights and\r\nsuperstructures of several sorts. If one may judge from the sculptures\r\nleft by the inhabitants of the early cities, their life was mainly\r\ntaken up with an extremely involved ritualistic religion which, in the\r\nhands of a priestly body, was at once the means by which they were\r\nruled and the outlet for the artistic gifts which they undeniably had.\r\nVery probably the over-elaborate religion was responsible for the\r\ntremendous mass of detail to be seen in so many of the ruined cities.\r\nSo great was the eagerness for space upon which to crowd ornamentation\r\nthat an architectural feature which served no purpose other than that\r\nof affording more ample space for decoration was evolved. The roof-comb\r\nis found in a high degree of development at Yaxchilan and elsewhere.\r\n(Spinden, 1913, p. 112, fig. 148.) Sometimes, as at Tikal, this\r\ncumbersome construction was carried to such lengths that the area\r\ncovered by walls was out of all natural proportion to that covered by\r\nrooms.\r\n\r\nOne can only conjecture what brought about the downfall of these\r\nancient cities in which a very advanced culture once flourished. It is\r\nnot impossible that the priesthood became so oppressive that an\r\nemigration took place; or, owing to a lack of proper agricultural\r\nknowledge, the fields probably became spent so that the people were\r\nforced to seek new homes; possibly also there was some sort of an\r\ninvasion from the west or east. Any one or all of these causes may have\r\nbrought about the succeeding period, one which lies within and at the\r\nend of the Golden Age.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The Colonization Period (450-700 A.D.). This period is chiefly\r\nnotable for us because it marks the beginning of documentary history\r\nand because the Itzas are first specifically mentioned in connection\r\nwith it.[3]\r\n\r\nAbout 450 Ziyan Caan or Bakhalal was built, to be occupied only some\r\nsixty years. (Spinden, 1913, Table 2; Brinton, 1882, Chr. I.) According\r\nto Chronicle V the use of the name Itza dates from the founding of\r\nChichen Itza, an event which took place about 510.[4] At this time\r\nthere also occurred important changes in the calendar system, an event\r\nsymbolized in the Chronicles by the phrase \"Pop was set in order.\"\r\n\r\nThere is, then, in this period of colonization, a well-defined\r\nmigration northward. The ancient cities in the south did not die out at\r\nonce, and we may suppose that the sixth century of our era was a time\r\nof great cultural activity. It is interesting to know that the old Maya\r\nculture and the Tiahuanaco culture (the two greatest American\r\ncivilizations) were probably in part at least contemporaries. (Cf.\r\nMeans, 1917.)\r\n\r\nThe Chronicles are vague and divergent on the question of how long the\r\nfirst occupation of Chichen Itza lasted. Chronicle I says 120 years;\r\nChronicle II says 200; Chronicle III says 240. As two of the three\r\nimportant Chronicles place the length of occupation at 200 years or\r\nmore, we may assume that it lasted from about 500 to 700 of our era.\r\n\r\nTo this period we may confidently attribute some of the structures at\r\nChichen. It has been shown that the Casa de Monjas at Chichen underwent\r\nseveral periods of construction. It is what Mr. Thompson has called\r\n\"Old Chichen,\" however, that is most surely associated with the period\r\nwe are now discussing. In that portion of the ruins Mr. Thompson found\r\na lintel dated 10.2.9.1.9. (about 610). As the building in which the\r\nlintel was found is one of a group that is quite distinct from the rest\r\nof the ruins, it may be believed that they all date from the first\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nWe have, of course, no satisfactory data from which to derive an\r\nopinion as to the territorial expansion of the kingdom ruled from Old\r\nChichen (if, indeed, it was ruled from there). Spinden (1913, p. 201),\r\nhowever, has found ample reason for believing that Xcalumkin, Xlabpak,\r\nSayil, Kabah, and Tabi were flourishing at this period. Briefly, the\r\npresence of a modified form of the \"manikin scepter\" and of the stela\r\n(both characteristic of the ancient cities) convinces him that all\r\nthese places were erected before the influence of the Old Empire cities\r\nhad died out.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Transitional Period (700-1000 A.D.). The Maya-Itza stock now\r\nreentered upon their migrations. They moved, about 700, to Chakanputum,\r\nwhere they stayed until about 950. The Chronicles all agree as to the\r\nlength of time the Itzas were at Chakanputum. Of this site we know\r\nlittle beyond the fact that Cortes, when he visited it in 1519, found a\r\nlarge village there.\r\n\r\nJust before the Itzas left Champoton, or perhaps just after, Uxmal was\r\nfounded by Ahcuitok Tutul Xiu, who, according to the tradition,\r\nprobably came from the west. The lords of this city were destined to\r\nhave an important part to play in the history of the Itzas. About the\r\nyear 1000 the cities of Uxmal, Chichen, and Mayapan formed a\r\nconfederation which has been called the League of Mayapan. After three\r\nor four hundred years of unrest after the disintegration of the Old\r\nEmpire a New Empire was about to begin its career.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Renaissance or League Period (1000-1200 A.D.). In the Golden Age or\r\nOld Empire the civilization of the Maya race had centered about Lake\r\nPeten, in the extreme south of the peninsula of Yucatan. In the time of\r\nthe New Empire the old cities in the south were gradually forgotten and\r\nnew ones, quite as remarkable, sprang up in the northern portion of the\r\npeninsula. Three cities probably shared the sovereign power, forming,\r\nby their alliance, the celebrated League of Mayapan. These cities were\r\nUxmal, ruled by the Xiu family, Mayapan, possibly ruled by the Cocom[5]\r\nfamily, and Chichen Itza. The latter is, of course, our chief concern;\r\nbut as it has been often described we will only say that it may have\r\nhad, at one time, as many as one hundred thousand inhabitants and that\r\nthe culture that throve there was of a high order.\r\n\r\nThe political features of the League of Mayapan are difficult to\r\ndescribe with accuracy. Each of the three great cities had its ruling\r\nfamily. Below these was an order of personages called _batab_, each of\r\nwhom held and ruled a portion of the country. The _batab_ stood in much\r\nthe same relation to the ruler of the large city as a medieval baron to\r\nthe king. Doubtless each _batab_, ruling from his own city, had a\r\nhierarchy of officers under him. Probably Labna, Kabah, Chacmultun,\r\nSayil, Hochob, Ake, Tihoo, Acanceh, Tinum, Kewick, and all the other\r\ncities in northern Yucatan were once seats of _batabs_ who were more or\r\nless intimately connected with the ruler of one of the three great\r\ncities. There was ample machinery for the administration of justice,\r\nand crimes were fittingly punished. Such positions as the Halach Uinic\r\n(Real Man, i.e., king) of Mayapan and the office of batab of some\r\nlesser city usually were inherited according to the rules of\r\nprimogeniture, but this custom could, for sufficient cause, be set\r\naside.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. The Period of the Toltec Mercenaries (1200-1450 A.D.). However much\r\nin the dark we may be as to the details of the events which brought\r\nabout the downfall of the League of Mayapan, we are in no doubt as to\r\nthe main causes of its disruption. Speaking in very general terms, the\r\nsituation was as follows. The ruler of Mayapan seems to have been the\r\ntrouble maker. Becoming ambitious to extend his power over the other\r\nHalach Uinicil, he called in a number of mercenaries from Mexico. With\r\nthe aid of these allies the Halach Uinic of Mayapan made himself master\r\nof the whole northern part of Yucatan, but he had to pay a heavy price\r\nin the shape of giving Chichen Itza to his allies.\r\n\r\nDuring all these troubles the Xius at Uxmal seem to have preserved a\r\ncertain amount of independence; certainly as time went on and as the\r\npower of Mayapan became more and more tyrannically oppressive, the Xius\r\ngradually became the champions of the oppressed. It was but natural\r\nthat those of the Itza _batabs_ who still remained at Chichen should\r\nresent the alien dominion placed over them. If we may believe Chronicle\r\nI, they made at least one attempt to get back their old power. The\r\ndiscontent of the Itza element of the population, a discontent always\r\nshared in by the Xius at Uxmal, continued to increase during two\r\nhundred and fifty years. In that period Chichen Itza, under the\r\ninfluence of its Toltec rulers, witnessed its final period of\r\narchitectural development. The Ball Court, the Castillo, the Group of\r\nthe Columns, and other buildings were erected under Toltec influence.\r\nIt is easy to recognize and identify the structures of this period\r\nbecause they are usually distinguished by such features as serpent\r\ncolumns, _tlaxtli_ or ball courts, Atlantean supports, feathered\r\nmonsters, and speech scrolls.\r\n\r\nAbout 1450 the inevitable revolution against the tyranny of the Toltecs\r\ntook place, and with it civilization of the highest type came to an\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Disintegration (1450-1541 A.D.). Centralized feudalistic\r\ngovernment destroyed, Yucatan fell into a sad plight. Where one or two\r\nstrong states had been before there were now a score of weak ones. In\r\nthe wars of this period the once great cities of the League were\r\ndestroyed and abandoned; new and far less advanced cities were founded\r\nto take their place. The remnant of the Xiu family retired to Mani; the\r\nCocom became lords of Zotuta. Itzamal seems to have become a sacerdotal\r\nstate under the dominion of the Chel family. The Itzas, in whom our\r\nchief interest lies, probably withdrew far to the south and founded\r\ntheir power in the region about Lake Peten. Brinton (1882, p. 25.)\r\ngives this list of the small independent states found by the Spaniards:\r\n\r\n      1 ACALAN (Bahia de Terminos)\r\n      2 TIXCHEL (Telchac)\r\n      3 KIN PECH (Campeche)\r\n      4 CHAKANPUTUN (Champoton)\r\n      5 CANUL\r\n      6 HOCABAIHUMUN\r\n      7 CEHPECH (Merida region)\r\n      8 ZIPATAN (northwest coast)\r\n      9 CHOACA (northeast coast)\r\n     10 EKAB (opposite Cozumel)\r\n     11 CONIL (north coast, west of Choaca)\r\n     12 -- -- -- -- -- --\r\n     13 CHETEMAL (southern end of east coast)\r\n     14 TAITZA (Itza, Peten district)\r\n     15 AH KIN CHEL (Itzamal region)\r\n     16 ZOTUTA (Cocom state, between Merida and Valladolid)\r\n     17 MANI (Xiu state, southwest of Zotuta)\r\n\r\nIn number 14 we recognize the Itzas of Peten. The close of this period\r\nof Disintegration (period VII) ushers in the eighth period, which will\r\ntake up the remainder of our attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  NOTE\r\n            COGOLLUDO'S ACCOUNT OF THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE\r\n                   MAYAS AND OF SOME OF THEIR CUSTOMS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well to present the account of the pre-Columbian history of the\r\nMayas as given by Cogolludo. It will be seen to differ greatly from the\r\nmore scientific view just given, but it presents points of interest. It\r\nwill be found in lib. iv, cap. 3.\r\n\r\n\"Neither from the peoples who populated this Kingdom of Yucatan nor\r\nfrom their ancient Histories have I been able to find more than I shall\r\nsay here. In some writings which those who first learned how to write\r\nleft behind them, and which are in the native idiom (which is still\r\nused among the Indians), it says that some of the people came from the\r\nEast and some from the West. With those who were from the Occident was\r\none who, as it were, was a Priest of theirs, called _Zamna_; and they\r\nsay that he it was who gave the names by which they are called in that\r\ntongue to all the Ports of the Sea, points of land, estuaries, coasts,\r\nand all the regions, sites, mountains (forests), and all the places of\r\nthis entire land; and certain it is that it is a thing worthy of\r\nadmiration if it was so, for such a division did he make of everything\r\nin order that each spot might be known by its own name that there is\r\nscarcely a palm of land which has not a name in their tongue. The\r\nopinion that the settlers came to this land from the Occident (although\r\nthey do not know who they were nor how they came) is in accord with\r\nwhat Padre Torquemada says in his Monarquia Indiana. (Lib. iii, cap.\r\n13.) This is, That the Teochichimecas, after that terrible battle with\r\nthe Huexotzincas, remained lords of the territory of Tlaxcalan, and\r\nmade peace with the other nations on account of the fame of that\r\nvictory of theirs. These Teochichimecas must needs found their towns\r\nand distribute their lands in such a manner that they were constantly\r\nincreasing their power and gradually occupying the country in such a\r\nway that in a little more than 300 years they had spread through the\r\ngreater part of New Spain from one coast on the North to the other on\r\nthe South, a territory which includes all the inland regions which are\r\nto the East, and especially those of this province of Yucathan as far\r\nas the province of Hibueras or Honduras. From this it seems that the\r\nYucatecs are descended from Chichimec and Aculhua families which,\r\ncoming from the West by way of the stopping-places told of by Father\r\nTorquemada in his first books, settled New Spain.\r\n\r\n\"If from the Orient came other peoples who settled in this land, there\r\nis among the people now there neither tradition nor writing telling\r\nwith certainty from whence they came nor what people they were,\r\nalthough, however, it is said (by some) that they came from the Island\r\nof Cuba. Difficulty arises now, for some came from some regions and\r\nothers from very different ones, yet all speak a very ancient tongue,\r\nnor has there been any information saying that any other has existed in\r\nthe land. But this might have been occasioned by some tribes being more\r\nnumerous than others, or by reason of war, or by trade and\r\ncommunication which, by strengthening the relations of the one race\r\nwith the other, may have caused the idiom, usages, and customs of those\r\nwho were of the greatest number to prevail over and obliterate those of\r\nthe less numerous people. From the very differences which exist between\r\nthe Yucatec tongue and the Mexican, it seems that the Settlers of this\r\nland must have been they who came from the East; and they may even have\r\nbeen the most ancient people since the Indian Zamna who came with them\r\nwas he who first gave names to the places and lands, as has been told\r\nalready, for if the others had been the first, they would have done so.\r\nPadre Lizana says the opposite because, first calling attention to the\r\nfact that these Indians call the East _Cenial_, and the West,\r\n_Nohnial_, the first of which signifies Small Descent and the second\r\nLarge Descent, he says: 'And it is a fact that they relate that from\r\nthe East descended upon this land a small race and from the West a\r\nlarge one; and by that phrase do they understand little and much, East\r\nand West, few from the one, many from the other.' The Reader will judge\r\nwhich seems to him the better.\r\n\r\n\"This land of Yucathan, which the natives of it call _Maya_, was\r\ngoverned for a long time by a Supreme Lord, and the last descendant of\r\nthese Lords was Tutul Xiu, he who was Lord of Mani and its neighborhood\r\nwhen, voluntarily, he came to do homage, making himself a friend of the\r\nSpaniards on the day of San Ildefonso, 1541, as has been told. Thus it\r\nappears that there has ever been in the land a Monarchical government\r\nwhich, according to the most weighty opinion among Writers, is the best\r\nfor the conservation of Realms. This King had for the capital of his\r\nMonarchy a very populous City called Mayapan (from which must have been\r\nderived the name of this land, Maya); this capital, through wars and\r\ndiscords between the King and his vassals, and because justice lay only\r\nin the greatest power among them (unhappy the times in which the\r\nSupreme Lord has not a power equal to his justice), this government\r\ncame to an end; many of the Lords and Caciques rebelled, each\r\ndominating the greatest amount of land he could, and being always\r\nengaged in continuous wars; thus the Spaniards found them (divided into\r\nestates, like Dukes and Counts, albeit without recognizing any\r\nSuperior). When Yucathan was left entirely without a Supreme Lord, then\r\nthe ambition of private persons who united their forces and banded\r\ntogether to effect their will, resulted in their ordering the\r\ndestruction of the City of Mayapan, Capital of the Kingdom; they\r\ndemolished it about the year of Our Lord fourteen hundred and twenty\r\n(according to the computation of the ages [_Ahaus?_] of the Indians)\r\nand about the 260th year of their establishment. By this rebellion he\r\nwho was King and Supreme Lord of all Yucathan was left only with the\r\nLordship of Mani whither he retired upon the destruction of the City of\r\nMayapan which was where now are to be seen the ruins of buildings, near\r\nthe Village of Telchaquillo. They left him with this small power partly\r\nbecause of the fidelity of those vassals who did not deny him obedience\r\ndue, and partly because of the permission given by the rebels who knew\r\nthat he had not now more strength than any of themselves....\r\n\r\n\"When the Lords of the City of Mayapan were ruling all the land was\r\ntributary to them. The tribute was in small cotton mantles, native\r\nfowl, some cacao in those places where it was got, and a resin which\r\nserved as incense in the Temples, and all told it was very small in\r\nquantity. All the citizens and dwellers who lived within the City of\r\nMayapan were free from tribute; and in the city all the nobles of the\r\nland had houses; and by the year 1582 (in which was written the\r\nrelation from which all this is drawn) it is said that all those who\r\nwere held to be Lords and nobles of Yucathan still remembered, in that\r\nplace, their old lots. Now with the change of government and because of\r\nthe slight estimation in which they are held ... the descendants of\r\nTutul Xiu, who was King and by right natural Lord, if they do not work\r\nwith their hands at labor, have nothing to eat, and toil does not now\r\nseem to them unworthy of consideration. In ancient times, the nobles of\r\nMayapan were wont to serve in the Temples of the Idols in the\r\nceremonies and feasts which were by right assigned to them, assisting\r\nby day and by night; and though many themselves had vassals, they\r\nrecognized the Supreme Lord, and served him in his wars.\r\n\r\n\"They who dwelt without the City and in the rest of the Province were\r\nvassals and tributaries, not being of those who had houses there in the\r\ncapacity of land-holders; but they were greatly favored by their Lords\r\nbecause they themselves served them as Advocates looking out for their\r\nwelfare with great solicitude whenever anyone asked that it be so. They\r\n(the vassals and tributaries) were not obliged to live in assigned\r\nVillages since they had license to live and to marry with whomsoever\r\nthey wished; the object of this was to ensure multiplication, for they\r\nsaid that if the people were hampered, there could not fail to result a\r\ndiminution. Lands were held in common, and so between the Villages\r\nthere were no boundaries or landmarks to divide them; although it is\r\ntrue that between one Province and another because of wars, save some\r\nfields for sowing fruit-bearing trees and land which had been bought\r\nfor some purpose of improvement [incomplete sentence in the Spanish].\r\nAlso the salt-works which are on the Shores of the Sea were held in\r\ncommon, and those who dwelt nearest to them were wont to pay tribute to\r\nthe Lords of Mayapan with salt which they had got....\r\n\r\n\"The Lords were absolute in power and caused their orders to be\r\nexecuted with severity. There were Caciques placed in the Villages, or\r\nsome other leading person to hear suits and public demands. This\r\nofficer received the litigants or disputants, heard the cause of their\r\ncoming, and, if the matter were a grave one, talked it over with the\r\nLord. In order to try the case, other Ministers were appointed who were\r\nlike Advocates and Constables and who always attended in the presence\r\nof the judges.... They were not in the habit of writing down the\r\nlawsuits, although they had characters (of which many are to be seen in\r\nthe ruins of their buildings). All was set forth in words by means of\r\nthe Ministers before referred to, and what was then and there\r\ndetermined remained valid and permanent without either of the parties\r\nventuring to work against it. But if the affair which was to be tried\r\nconcerned many, they had a great meeting of all the interested\r\ntogether; then the gist was communicated, upon which followed the\r\ndecision of the matter.\r\n\r\n\"In sales and contracts they had neither writings to oblige them to\r\nkeep their word nor promissory notes with which to give satisfaction,\r\nbut still the contract remained valid provided only that the parties\r\ndrank together publicly before witnesses. This was particularly the\r\nusage in sales of slaves or of cacao-lands, and even today (it is said)\r\nthey use it still among themselves in the sale of horses and cattle.\r\nThe debtor never denied the debt even though he could not pay at once;\r\nbut all was made certain by the debtor's confessing his debt, for the\r\nwife, children and relatives of the debtor would pay the debt after his\r\ndeath....\r\n\r\n\"In the wars which because of their ambition they made upon one\r\nanother, some were taken prisoners, those of the conquered who were\r\ntaken remaining slaves. In this situation they were very rigorous,\r\ntreating the enslaved with asperity, and making use of them in all\r\nsorts of bodily labor.\r\n\r\n\"In food-supplies there were no bargains, because they were always\r\nfixed at one price, save Maize, which was wont to go up when crops were\r\npoor, but it never passed what it is now worth, a _real_ or so, the\r\nload (which is half a Castillian fanega).\r\n\r\n\"The money that they used was little bells and jingles of copper, which\r\nhad value according to their size, and some red shells, which were\r\nbrought from far away from this land, which they strung, after the\r\nmanner of rosaries. Also they used as money grains of cacao, and of\r\nthese they made the most use in commerce, and certain precious stones\r\nand discs of copper brought from New Spain which they exchanged for\r\nother things, as happens elsewhere....\"\r\n\r\nCogolludo (lib. iv, cap. 5) continues with the following account of the\r\ncustoms:\r\n\r\n\"For display and on gala occasions, they used to scarify themselves\r\nwith certain small points of stone on the breasts, arms and thighs;\r\nthey even went so far as to draw blood, and in the wounds they rubbed a\r\nblack earth or powdered carbon. When they scarified with these knives\r\nthe scars remained, shaped like Eagles, serpents, birds and animals,\r\nand they perforated the nose as well.... The Cupules, who are the\r\npeople of the territory of the Town of Valladolid, used this practice a\r\ngreat deal.\r\n\r\n\"In the times of their heathenry, as now, they danced and sang after\r\nthe manner of the Mexicans, and they used to have, as indeed they still\r\ndo have, a chief Singer (or Chanter) who intones, and who appoints what\r\nthey shall sing; and him they venerate and reverence, giving him an\r\nhonorable seat in Church, and at their assemblies and weddings. They\r\ncall him _Holpop_, and in his charge are the kettle-drums or _Tuncules_\r\nand other musical instruments, such as the flutes, little trumpets,\r\ntortoise-shells, and others that they used. The _Tuncul_ is of thick\r\nwood, and there are some so large that they can be heard at a distance\r\nof two leagues to leeward. To the accompaniment of these instruments\r\nthey sing their fables and old legends; all this will be reformed, or\r\nrather, the Religious have already done so in many places, giving the\r\nIndians Histories of Saints and some of the Mysteries of the Faith to\r\nsing, at least at public dances, Easter celebrations, and festivities,\r\nso that the ancient times will be forgotten.\r\n\r\n\"They have Babblers [Farfante = babbler, boaster; may mean jester,\r\nbuffoon] who repeat fables and ancient Histories, which I am certain\r\nwould be well done away with, or at least the costumes in which they\r\nare represented, because it appears that they are like those of their\r\nHeathen Priests; and when there is no worse harm than the preservation\r\namong them of that memory, it appears a very pernicious thing, for it\r\ninclines them all the more to the idolatrous practices which they\r\nindulge in when wearing the costume; but every one will have his own\r\nopinion in this matter, conformable, more or less, to what his\r\nobservation has taught him. The babblers are apt to be graceful at\r\nmottoes and in the witty sayings which they tell to their elders and\r\nJudges if they are over-rigourous, ambitious, avaricious, laying before\r\nthem the events that have taken place and even that which concerns the\r\nofficer's own duties. They thus speak to the officers' very faces, and\r\nsometimes they rebuke them with a single word. But he who would\r\nunderstand them must be a great linguist and must listen well. They are\r\nvery dangerous, these representations, when they are held at night and\r\nin the Indians' own houses, for God knows what goes on there, and at\r\nthe very least many of them end up in drunkenness. They call these\r\nFarfantes _Balzam_, and they apply the word metaphorically to him who\r\nis talkative and scurrilous; and in their representations they mimic\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\n\"They held, and still do hold, banquets on the occasion of weddings and\r\nbetrothals, using up in one day many turkeys that they have been\r\nbreeding for a whole year. Those who are leaving the office of Alcalde\r\nentertain those who are entering it, on the pain of disgrace, and on\r\nelection nights there is much drunkenness.\r\n\r\n\"The Indians of this land were and are very dextrous with the bow and\r\narrows, and so they are mighty huntsmen, and they grow dogs so that\r\nthey may fetch deer, wild boar, badgers. Tigers, some little Lions,\r\nrabbits, armadillos, iguanas, and other animals. They shoot with their\r\narrows peacocks [sic], some birds they call _faysanes_ [pheasants], and\r\nmany others.\r\n\r\n\"At present they are great imitators of all the different sorts of\r\nhandiwork that are made, and so they learn all the trades with ease.\r\nThere are many Indians in their villages, beside those who live in the\r\nCity and in the Towns, who are great workers as smiths, locksmiths,\r\nbridlemakers, shoemakers, carpenters, wood-carvers, sculptors,\r\nsaddlers, tradesmen who make many curious things out of shell,\r\nbricklayers, stonecutters, tailors, painters, and so on. What causes\r\nwonder is that there are many Indians who work at four or six trades\r\nwhere a Spaniard would have but one ... but with that almost innate\r\ncoolness for work they supply their wants and turn out good work, which\r\nthey sell more cheaply than the Spaniards do, so that those tradesmen\r\nwho go to Yucathan fare badly at their trades; so there are but few of\r\nthem, and they seek other means of earning a livelihood.\r\n\r\n\"They wear clothes of very white cotton, of which they make shirts,\r\nbreeches, and certain mantles a vara and a half square which they call\r\n_tilmas_ or _hayantes_. These can be made to serve as capes by drawing\r\nthe two corners up on the shoulder and making a knot; indeed, very many\r\npeople use ones made out of somewhat coarse woven wool, and even many\r\nof stuffs brought from Spain, such as damasks and other silks. Some use\r\njackets, and many wear shoes and hempe sandals. The usual custom,\r\nhowever, is to go barefoot, especially in their own houses and fields,\r\nbut the opposite is true of some Caciques and leading men, and of\r\nwomen. Most of the men wear hats of straw or palm-leaves, and nowadays\r\nmany buy felt hats. The women use _Uaipiles_, which is a garment that\r\nfalls from the throat to the middle of the leg, with an opening at the\r\ntop, where the head goes, and two others at the top of the sides for\r\nthe arms, which are covered half-way down. Because this garment is not\r\ntied in at the waist, it also serves as a shirt. From the waist to the\r\nfeet is another garment called _Pic_, and it is like petticoats and\r\ngoes under the outer garment. Most of these are worked with blue and\r\nred thread, which makes them sightly. If a Spanish woman is seen in\r\nthis dress it looks, on her, most improper. Little Indian girls who are\r\ngrowing up with Spanish women become great embroiderers, seamstresses,\r\nand patchers, and they make things that are sold at large prices and\r\nmuch esteemed.\r\n\r\n\"For Sundays and Feast-days when they go to Mass, and when they are to\r\nbe confessed, both men and women have cleaner and neater clothes, which\r\nthey keep for this. Other customs and things of theirs will be learned\r\nthrough the laws that have been given to remedy them, which will be\r\nrelated in the Fifth Book.\r\n\r\n\"There were Indians in the past days of their ancestors who had larger\r\nbodies than those now common, bodies which were found in the sepulchres\r\nof this land and which had gigantic stature. In 1647 in the village of\r\nVecal, on the royal road of Campeche, Padre Fray Juan de Carrion (now\r\nProvincial Commissioner for the next General Chapter) ordered his\r\nIndians to make an arbor for a reception he was to hold. They had just\r\nset up the sticks with which it was to be made when the tools hit upon\r\na very large sepulchre made of flag-stones placed one over another\r\nwithout any peculiarities of carving whatever. The Indians ran away\r\nfrom it and went to call the Padre, who, on arriving, ordered them to\r\ntake out whatever was in the sepulchre. The Indians did not want to do\r\nthis, saying that it was prohibited for them to touch anything of that\r\nsort. So the Padre, with the aid of a small boy, got out the bones of a\r\nman of formidable size. There were in the sepulchre three bowls of very\r\nfine pottery having three hollow balls in place of feet, and there was\r\na small black box of what appeared to be jasper. The Padre burned the\r\nbones, threw them away, and filled up the hole, rebuking the Indians\r\nfor not wishing to touch it, on the plea that it was forbidden to them\r\nto do so....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                THE POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND GEOGRAPHICAL\r\n                   FEATURES OF THE ITZA STATE DURING\r\n                        THE PERIOD OF 1445-1697\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Significance of the Itzas. The dates of the Itza dominance over the\r\nregion around Tayasal are roughly those given above. Although the\r\nSpaniards became a factor in the lives of the Itzas about 1525, their\r\npresence does not alter the fact that this tribe was so powerful as to\r\nbe able to preserve its independence for a long time. The Itzas may be\r\nconsidered as presenting, in diminished form, all the more important\r\npolitical and social conditions that had formerly characterized the\r\ngreat Maya states in the northern part of the peninsula. We will now\r\nstudy these conditions so as to understand better the problems the\r\nSpanish conquerors were called upon to meet and to solve later on. In\r\nspite of the proximity of the Spaniards, it is doubtful whether the\r\nItzas changed much during the two hundred and fifty years they occupied\r\nthe Peten or Tayasal region.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Location of Peten or Tayasal. The Itza stronghold was located at\r\nPeten or Tayasal.[2.1] The present city of Flores, located on a small\r\nisland in the Lake of Peten, is sometimes thought to be the site of\r\nancient Tayasal. Others think that Tayasal was really on the peninsula\r\nnorth of Flores. This latter opinion is held by Mr. Morley and Dr.\r\nTozzer, who have been on the spot. The former believes that the lake\r\nwas formerly higher than now, which would explain how the present\r\npeninsula, formerly an island, attained its present condition. The\r\nisland of Flores is scarcely more than half a mile in diameter;\r\nAvendano says that Tayasal was half a league long. The reader is urged\r\nto compare Plates II and III for the purpose of seeing how the modern\r\nappearance of Tayasal or Peten is different from its appearance a few\r\ncenturies ago. As visitors to Tayasal usually either came or left by\r\nway of Tipu, the distance from Tayasal to the shore which they\r\ngenerally traveled was that from the village to the eastern end of the\r\nlake, a journey often said to be six leagues in length, which is\r\napproximately correct. Perhaps the most important piece of evidence is\r\nthat given by Avendano's sketch map (Pls. Ia, Ib). He gives three\r\n_cayos_ or islands in the lake. They are arranged in such a way that\r\nthe Cayo Grande (Tayasal) is to the east; just northwest of it is Otro\r\nCayo (Another Cayo). I believe that after the general level of the lake\r\nfell these two _cayos_ were united and formed the present peninsula.\r\nFlores is on the _cayo_ shown by Avendano as just south and east of\r\nthese two. Maler, who is among those who have used the name Tayasal,\r\nsays that the name means \"in the midst of green waters.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of Peten and its Surroundings. We will now give Padre\r\nAvendano's account of the region occupied by the Itzas and ruled by\r\ntheir king, Canek: \"Before we leave the said Peten Ytza, it is well to\r\ngive the clearest information about it, its territories and its people,\r\nso that, in the future, historians may have clear light about it and\r\nmay give in full the necessary information. Peten Ytza is situated in\r\nthe middle of a great lake and there are not only this one on which the\r\nKing lives, but also four other _Petens_, or islands which also lie in\r\nthe said lake. Others say that these _Petens_ are seven in number, and\r\nstill others that there are thirty, and that this lake also surrounds\r\nthe seven, as some say, as well as the thirty which the others speak\r\nof. What is certain is that I stopped there and asked purposely what\r\nnumber of people and _Petens_ the Ytzalana nation contained, and they\r\ntold me that there were only five _Petens_. The lake which surrounds\r\nthem is large, its length I have not measured, nor have I gone over\r\nmore than the part of it by which I came, which was three leagues\r\nacross, more or less (entering it at the West and going eastward), till\r\none reaches the _Peten_ on which the King lives. But the length of the\r\nsaid lake which runs from North to South (as far as we could see it),\r\nalthough we did not succeed in seeing to its end, was probably from\r\neight to ten leagues.[2.2] There are some who say that the said lake is\r\nsixty leagues long. If it is true that it surrounds the above thirty\r\n_Petens_, it is not improbable that it is of that length. The principal\r\n_Peten_ or island (the court where the King lives) must be more than\r\nhalf a league long and is a high island from which many hills are seen\r\nall around. The situation is very pleasant on account of these hills\r\nbeing in sight, as well as the five _Petens_ which the lake encloses,\r\nso that from the said _Petun_ any one is seen who comes across the lake\r\nfrom a distance from any one of the four directions, as well as those\r\nwho go fishing on the lake....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lake neither Rises nor Falls. \"I asked them why they had their\r\nhouses so close to the shore of the lake, and if they had any trouble\r\nwith its risings and fallings. They told me that they had no trouble,\r\nsince the lake never rose or fell. From this it is inferred that\r\nit is also true that no river enters it or flows out of it on the\r\nsurface,--either of rapid or gentle current, as many who speak of this\r\nlake try to show; since, if such a stream entered it, or left it, it\r\ncould not fail to increase with the freshets, as in dry times to grow\r\nsmaller; although we should not be able to deny the hidden and\r\nsubterranean connection of this lake with other neighboring lakes,\r\nbecause of its permanent preservation of level....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Temples of Tayasal Described by Avendano. \"In order to worship the\r\n... idols[2.3] there are nine very large buildings, made in the form of\r\nthe churches of this Province,--all new, with traces of others which\r\nhad been burned, although they built them again, as I saw in the case\r\nof two which had been rebuilt. All such buildings have a wall about a\r\nyard and a half high and of the thickness of six quarters; the bench or\r\nseat all around, which stands out from the middle inwards, is three\r\nquarters thick and the rest, which stands out above, is three quarters\r\nthick; so that both together form two rows of seats around the said\r\nchurches, and all repainted and polished.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Palace of Canek, Chief of the Itzas. \"Of this same workmanship is\r\nthe hall[2.4] which the King or Ah Canek has as a vestibule to his\r\nhouse, in which he receives his guests as he did us, although in\r\naddition it has the floor covered with bitumen and polished, which the\r\nsaid temples do not have. At the entrance of the said hall stands a\r\nlarge stone table more than two yards long and proportionally broad,\r\nplaced on stone columns, with twelve seats of the same around it for\r\nthe priests. This is the table of sacrifice, which they call in their\r\nlanguage _Mayactun_,--the first object which our eyes perceived in that\r\nfirst reception, from which, with the preceding attempts on the lake,\r\nwe were able to conjecture that they would put us to death; and the\r\nmore so when we saw that the number of people who ran together at the\r\nnovelty of seeing us was so great, that besides filling all the hall\r\ninside, those who could not find a place there, obstructed on the\r\noutside all the light which the hall had, and which came in all around\r\nit, so that they left us in such gloomy darkness, that, being seated,\r\nas I was, in the midst of my companion Padres, we could only perceive\r\none another by the touch; but such a thing did not come into our\r\nminds, but rather we understood that here was the room of welcome for\r\nall....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Districts of Peten Itza. \"I asked them how many districts that\r\n_Peten_ had on which we were, and counting by the fingers on their\r\nhands and the toes on their feet, they told me there were twenty-two,\r\nwhich they went on to describe by their names, and they are as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Districts of Peten Ytza on which the King Ah Canek lives--\r\n\r\n      That of King Ahcanek          That of Ach Cat Baca\r\n      That of noh ah chata          That of ach cat halach Vinic\r\n      That of Ah tze tzin batab     That of ach cat Mulcah\r\n      That of the cacique nohche    That of ach cat Kinchil\r\n      That of ach chatan ek         That of ach cat Kinchan\r\n      That of ach cat Cixban        That of ach cat Kayom (?)\r\n      That of noh tzo can Punab     That of ach cat Cit can\r\n      That of noh tzo can noh       That of ach cat Ytza\r\n      That of tzo can tzic          That of ach cat Pop\r\n      That of ach can Matan cua     That of ach cat Camal\r\n      That of ach cat Batun         That of ach cat Mas Kin\r\n\r\n\"These towns or districts bear the names of the cacique or head who\r\nrules them, as seen by the table above, although all have separate\r\nnames of their own, and all are subject, as are also the other\r\n_Petens_, to the King Ahcanek, and also all the communities which are\r\nfound in Cha Kan Ytza, besides those who are found on the main land\r\ntowards the East situated around the said _Petens_. This kingdom came\r\nto him by inheritance, and so their Kings are always Ah Can Eks. But\r\nnot because of this are all the Caneks of royal blood or relations of\r\none another; since also all those of his own town or district are\r\ncalled Caneks, and not on this account are they his relations, since\r\nthey also bear their lawful names and only have this one because of the\r\nchief who rules them. It is well known to the King that he holds this\r\nplace through blood, since it is certain that he and his family have a\r\nrare character and goodness, since he is so very good that all treat\r\nhim with some boldness, so that he is not able to govern what he\r\npossesses....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExtent of the Itza Dominion under the Chief Canek. It is from the\r\nFranciscan Fray Alonso Cano, who wrote about 1696, that we derive the\r\nclearest information as to the extent of the Itza dominions. He says:\r\n\"... The other forty-five leagues from Mopan to the Lake one travels\r\n(though with various windings) from South to North, with some little\r\ntendency to the North-west. This land belongs to the Mopanes and\r\nAhizaes, and it stretches to the East as far as the sea-coast ... Of\r\nthe boundaries of the Ahiza nation on the North the men of Yucatan will\r\ngive trustworthy information.\"\r\n\r\nAll the foregoing leads one to believe that the influence of Canek,\r\npetty chief of the Itzas, and of his immediate subjects was felt\r\nthroughout the region east of Lake Peten, the region in which are\r\nlocated Alain (or Yalain), San Clemente, Yaxha, and Tipu. Indeed\r\nVillagutierre (p. 460) leaves us in no doubt as to the fact that\r\nChamaxculu, the aged chief of Alain, was the direct vassal of Canek.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuincanek. So far we have been considering only the political aspect of\r\nthe Itza state. There was an important sacerdotal organization as well.\r\nAs to its exact nature there is, unfortunately, some confusion.\r\nVillagutierre says that the head of the priesthood was the oldest\r\nbrother of Canek and that he bore the title of Quincanek. Cano says\r\nthat Cuin Kenek was the chief of Peten. Pedro Sanches de Leon,\r\nwriting in the eighteenth century, says (p. 146 ff.): \"In that time\r\n(1700-1703), or a little before, the conquest of the Lake of the\r\nAhitzaes took place, and the Indian kings were seen to enter Guatemala\r\nas prisoners; they were called after baptism Don Jose and Don Francisco\r\nCanek, and with them also was the high-priest of this nation, who was\r\nalso called Canek....\" Maler uses the terms Canek and Kincanek\r\ninterchangeably. The question is not an important one, and I shall make\r\nno attempt to solve it.\r\n\r\nFurther Information about the Region. \"... In the northerly direction\r\nlies the Kingdom of Yucathan; towards the South, the road which the men\r\nof Gautemala have opened, starting from Vera Paz; on the West, Cha Kan\r\nYtza and the Cehaches; on the East, slightly North, the nation of the\r\nmen of Tipu; in the direction of the South, running from East to West,\r\nare very high ridges, which are really the Sierra Madre, from which (in\r\nNew Spain) they exploit mines, and as there are mines there, there is\r\nno doubt that there are some here, since it is one and the same ridge.\r\nThere must be mines in the environs of this nation of the Ytzaes,\r\nbecause the most of the Indians (in some large ear drops which they\r\nwear) have roses of silver hanging down, and others of silver and gold,\r\nand as the Spaniards do not come to this nation, nor the Indians of\r\nthis Province of Yucathan, nor of the other provinces, because they are\r\nafraid of them, I do not know where they could get this gold and silver\r\nunless they took it from some mine. In the said southerly direction\r\nrunning towards the East, the said Peten Ytzaes have their farms and\r\ntilled fields on the main land; and in said fields they have their\r\nhouses as in Peten, so as to live there all the time that the\r\ncultivation lasts, so that the houses are doubled in number as well as\r\nthe families. From this, people imagine that this nation is more\r\nnumerous than it really is.\r\n\r\n\"The largest and best calculation which I can make of this nation was\r\nfrom the account which the King and his chiefs gave me, and this was\r\nthat the _Peten_ in which we stopped consisted of twenty-two districts\r\nand towns, and they did not know how to give me the count of each town,\r\nsince they know how to count only up to twenty, and in going beyond\r\nmany twenties, they do not know how to explain it, for it appears to\r\nthem an infinite number.[2.5] I did not have much time to verify this,\r\nfor I preferred to employ the little time I had in baptizing; but\r\nnevertheless from what I saw and understood of the number of the people\r\nof all ages, I say that Peten Ytza, with the other _Petenes_, Cha Kan\r\nYtzaes and Tuluncies (?), with the communities, which are found on the\r\nmain land, will all come up to twenty-four or twenty-five thousand\r\nsouls,--a thousand more or less. This computation I make from the\r\n_Peten_ on which the King lives, for he told me that all the _Petens_\r\nwere equal in the number of people, with but little difference.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Itzas Described. \"These Ytzaes are well-featured and, like\r\nmestizos, nearly all of a light complexion and of very perfect stature\r\nand of natural gifts. But the Devil has compelled them, in their\r\nweakness, to make themselves hideous and witches, because it appears to\r\nthem a greater feat to frighten by their appearance than to conquer by\r\ntheir strength. And so most of them have their faces cut and rubbed in\r\nwith black, and some streaked like black negroes. And this hideousness\r\nmany women also show in their ear lobes, so that it is not possible for\r\nthem to wear ear drops or pendants. Painting themselves or cutting on\r\ntheir faces the form of the animal which they have as a charm, the men\r\nconsider themselves as more genteel than the women; and as they are of\r\nthis opinion, they dress themselves in this way, tying up their hair\r\nwith bands of cotton which are made by them, woven with many curious\r\ndesigns of various colors, with cords and tassels at the ends, made\r\nvery beautifully. They clothe themselves with something like jackets\r\nwith half sleeves, and all from top to bottom woven at intervals with\r\nstripes of various designs and incorporated in the same woof,--very\r\nlovely to look at. And with all these elegantly ornamented clothes,\r\nthey always paint themselves red and black. All this vanity and\r\neffeminate care to decorate themselves so much is a sign of what many\r\nbelieve, that it is [due to] the wicked vice which is common among\r\nthem; for the women do not go about well clothed nor do the men pay\r\nmuch attention to them; for the women wear only some skirts of cotton\r\nfrom their waist down, but from the waist up they go bare and\r\nuncovered, with their hair rolled up without as much care as the men.\r\nThe latter always go with little stools under their arms to sit on\r\nwherever they go; and at night they muffle themselves up with sheets\r\nwoven of various stripes and designs of different colors, like cloaks;\r\ntheir drink is always _posole_ or _saca_, which is a drink made of\r\ncooked maize, and they always drink it lukewarm, but they never like to\r\ndrink clear or cold water....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                THE FIRST SPANISH ENTRADAS INTO YUCATAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Spaniards in Yucatan. Although Fernando Cortes was the first\r\nSpaniard to penetrate the region occupied by the Itzas, he was not, of\r\ncourse, the first of his race to become acquainted with Yucatan and its\r\ninhabitants. It will be remembered that Columbus received a hint of the\r\nexistence of Yucatan from some Indian traders at the Isla de Guanajo\r\n(Isla de Pinos) in the year 1502. (Cogolludo, lib. i, cap 1.)[3.1]\r\nAlthough he failed to find it, we may say that from July, 1502, Yucatan\r\nwas known to the Spaniards. The first Spaniards who actually coasted\r\nthe shore of Yucatan were Juan Diaz de Solis and Vicente Yanez Pinzon,\r\nin the year 1506.\r\n\r\nIn 1511 or 1512 Vasco Nunez de Balboa, whose expedition was in Darien,\r\nfound it necessary to send to Hispaniola for supplies. He chose a\r\ncertain Valdivia for the errand, intrusted him with a caravel, and sent\r\nhim off. Valdivia was shipwrecked on Las Viboras, a reef near Jamaica,\r\nand only about twenty of his men escaped. (Molina, p. 11 ff.;\r\nMontesinos, vol. ii, p. 28 ff.; Landa, p. 15.) They were all captured\r\nby some Indians from Yucatan, who sacrificed all except Jeronimo de\r\nAguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero. The latter of these learned the language\r\nand went to Chectemal, where he married an Indian woman and became a\r\nmember of the tribe. (Landa, pp. 14-16. Chectemal = Salamanca = Bacalar\r\n= Bakhalal.)\r\n\r\nFrancisco Hernandez de Cordoba, 1517. All the Spaniards mentioned thus\r\nfar are connected only very remotely with our subject. In 1517,\r\nhowever, under the auspices of Diego Velazquez, Governor of Cuba, an\r\nexpedition was fitted out under the command of Don Francisco Hernandez\r\nde Cordoba. (Bernal Diaz, vol. i, p. 11; Landa, p. 16 ff.) As this and\r\none other expedition immediately preceded the entrada of Cortes, and as\r\nthey both came in contact with members of the Maya race, it is well\r\nthat a short account of the expeditions of Cordoba and of Grijalva\r\nshould be given.\r\n\r\nCordoba, with three ships provided by himself. Lope Ochoa de Caicedo,\r\nand Cristoval Morante, left Cuba on February 8, 1517. The avowed\r\npurpose of the expedition was to capture slaves for the Cuban market,\r\nand although it was directly against the royal will, Velazquez himself\r\nwas interested in the project. After a sail of twenty-one days the\r\nthree ships sighted a large town some two leagues from shore. This spot\r\nwas named Cape Catoche by the Spaniards. A brisk fight took place there\r\nbetween the natives and the white men, in which the latter were the\r\nvictors. Many Indian towns and settlements were seen as the Spaniards\r\nwent along the shore toward the west. Everywhere the Indians crowded\r\nout of their houses, temples, and idol houses to see the newcomers. At\r\nlength the town of Champoton was reached. There, it will be remembered,\r\nthe Itzas had lived for many years. However demoralized the Maya race\r\nmay have become elsewhere, here at least it was vigorous enough, for\r\nthe Indians of Champoton or Potonchan inflicted a great defeat on the\r\nSpaniards. (Bernal Diaz, vol. i, p. 24; Landa, p. 20.) The party went\r\nback to Cuba very shortly, and Cordoba reported to Velazquez as to what\r\nhad been found.\r\n\r\n\r\nJuan de Grijalva and Others, 1518. In the spring of 1518 Velazquez\r\ncaused another expedition to be fitted out. Juan de Grijalva was to be\r\nthe commodore, and Alonso de Avila, Francisco de Montejo, and Pedro de\r\nAlbarado were each to have command of a ship. From our point of view\r\nthe most important thing this expedition did was to visit the island of\r\nCozumel. They also visited las Mugers which takes its name from the\r\nfemale idols found there by the Spaniards. This party also touched at\r\nChampoton and even went as far as San Juan de Ulloa and the Rio\r\nPanuco.[3.2]\r\n\r\n\r\nCortes in Mexico, 1519. The next year, 1519, witnessed the setting out\r\nof Fernando or Hernando or Hernan Cortes. His achievements in Mexico in\r\nthe years 1519-1524 in nowise concern us. In the latter year, however,\r\nhe inaugurated the bold project of reaching Honduras by land from\r\nMexico. As an inevitable result of this plan he entered the territory\r\nof the Itzas. Villagutierre's account (lib. i, caps. 7, 8) of this\r\nexpedition is so complete that it is best for us to quote it in full.\r\nThe reader is urged to study Plate VI in order to learn the routes\r\nfollowed by Cortes and others.\r\n\r\n\r\nVillagutierre's Account of the Entrada of Cortes, 1524-1525. \"The\r\nItzalana nation, having reached its place of retirement, was now\r\nfortified in those Islands and Lakes which they occupied in the midst\r\nof many other barbarous forest nations, for none of the rest was as\r\npowerful as they.... After much fighting, Don Fernando Cortes had, by\r\nforce of arms and with many brilliant deeds, captured the Great City of\r\nMexico, Capital of the Northern American Empire. Also he had subjugated\r\nmany other regions, nearly all of New Spain, by 1521.\r\n\r\n\"In 1524, being desirous of settling Hibueras or Honduras, which is a\r\nvery good land, albeit far from Mexico, he [Cortes] had armed five\r\nships and a brigantine, all well provided with every sort of equipment.\r\nIn these he sent off four hundred Spaniards and thirty horses[3.3]\r\nunder the charge of Christoval de Olid, who had orders to take on at\r\nHavana as many more troops as were ready to go. Afterwards they were\r\nall to go and settle on the coast of Honduras, which was the purpose of\r\nthe voyage. But Christoval de Olid rose in rebellion with the ships and\r\nsoldiers. At length he arrived in Honduras, having taken prisoner Gil\r\nGonzalez de Avila. When all this was learned by Don Fernando Cortes he\r\nsent Francisco de las Casas with two ships and some soldiers against\r\nthe rebel. Him also did Christoval de Olid take prisoner. Afterwards\r\noccurred the great revolts, quarrels and murders which the historians\r\nrelate, but which I will not repeat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCortes Starts for Honduras. \"Don Fernando Cortes was greatly enraged\r\nthat Christoval de Olid, his old friend, should thus have risen up\r\nagainst him, causing so much ruin. So he determined to go in person to\r\npunish Olid. Nor did the thought of the great loss his absence would be\r\nto Mexico suffice to dissuade him....\r\n\r\n\"No arguments in the least changed his decision. He assembled all the\r\nSpaniards he could; there were more than four hundred infantry and\r\ncavalry, besides much artillery and baggage. In addition, there were\r\nbetween three and four thousand Indian warriors from Mexico, among whom\r\nwere King Quatemoz, the successor of the great Motezuma,... and the\r\nLords of Tacuba and Tezcuco, cities on the Lake of Mexico, and other\r\nMexican Lords. With these, Cortes took his march by land, and through\r\nregions so rough and impenetrable that they had never been pressed by\r\nhuman feet. They forced their way through the forests, opening paths\r\nand building very large bridges of wood so disproportionately thick\r\nthat some of them are still standing today and are called 'Bridges of\r\nCortes.' Cortes and his followers suffered hunger, bruises, illnesses,\r\nhard roads, worse lodgings, and other insupportable trials, so that to\r\ntell them all entire books would be needed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCortes Arrives at Izancanac. \"Don Fernando Cortes and those who were\r\nwith him arrived at the city of Izancanac[3.4] in the Province of\r\nAcalan. There was discovered the plot which King Quatemoz, the Lord of\r\nTacuba, and other Mexican chiefs had made between themselves to attack\r\nthe Spaniards while they were crossing some river or marsh. When all\r\nthe Spaniards were killed, the Mexicans planned to recover their\r\ndominions, breaking forth from their captivity. Having held a trial\r\n(although some say he did not do so) Cortes gave orders that Quatemoz\r\nshould be hanged, together with the Lord of Tacuba, his cousin, and\r\nother principal Mexicans. Eight, it is said, were hung....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of a Large Town. \"When these events had been completed, and\r\nwhile the army was marching forward over bad roads, they came upon a\r\npueblo very large and new, in which the houses had been but recently\r\ncompleted. The place was surrounded with very thick stockades of logs\r\nand of very sturdy planks. Before the entrance were deep trenches. This\r\nwall encircled the town in two rings, both very high. One was like a\r\nbarbican, having towers and loopholes for the archers. In another\r\nplace, but near the town, on some lofty rocks, were their watch-towers\r\nof stone, worked by hand and provided with adequate railings. On\r\nanother side was a deep marsh, and all these things served to make the\r\npueblo a great fortress.\r\n\r\n\"The Spaniards entered the town without hindrance and found it deserted\r\nand lonely. The Indians, its inhabitants, receiving news that the\r\nSpaniards were coming, had withdrawn to some large marshes some\r\ndistance from the pueblo. On inspecting the town and entering the\r\nhouses our men found in all and each one of them a great quantity of\r\nturkeys all prepared and dressed for eating by those Indians. Besides\r\nthese things they also found much corn-bread and other supplies such as\r\ndrinks, and a dish made of meat mixed with corn-bread called by those\r\nIndians _tamales_. They were all amazed at seeing such a novelty, and\r\nthey were, at the same time, delighted to see so much good food, as\r\nthey had suffered so much from hunger and lack of nourishment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards Suspect Treachery. \"All this set them to thinking,\r\nbecause it was such a new state of affairs, and they were puzzled to\r\nknow the plans of the Indians of that town, as much because of the\r\nnovelty of the situation as because they found in the middle of the\r\nvillage a house full of lances, bows, arrows, _macanas_, and other arms\r\nused by those Indians in their wars. And going out to see if any troops\r\nwere to be found outside of the village, they found no one, nor was\r\nthere, in the _milpas_ or farms, a single grain of maize or any other\r\nvegetable; so that the Spaniards were all the more confounded, and they\r\nmarveled, asking one another what it could mean.\r\n\r\n\"While the Spaniards were in this suspense, fifteen Indians came from\r\noutside the town who, as it was learned afterward, were very important\r\nmen; and when they arrived they went into the presence of Don Fernando\r\nCortes. Placing their hands upon the ground, and kissing the earth with\r\ngreat humility, and half weeping, they begged Cortes to favor them by\r\nnot burning their village, for they had come there but recently to\r\nfortify themselves against some other Indians called Lacandones,[3.5]\r\nwho were their enemies. These had been making a cruel war upon them,\r\nkilling many men and leveling and burning their villages, which they\r\nhad formerly had on the plains, as the Spaniards would see for\r\nthemselves....\"\r\n\r\n\"Don Fernando Cortes assured them by means of the Indian, Dona Marina\r\n(whom he had had with him ever since he entered Tabasco), that no harm\r\nshould be done them, nor would he permit any of his men to misuse\r\nanything which was theirs. Thereupon the Indians recovered their\r\nupright position, and then Don Fernando Cortes asked, with great\r\ncuriosity, why so many turkeys and fowls and all sorts of food had been\r\nprepared for his coming.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indians Explain why their Town was Deserted. \"The Indians replied\r\npromptly that it was because they had been expecting their mortal\r\nenemies, the Lacandones, who were coming to attack them. If the\r\nLacandones won in battle, they knew that all their property and fowls\r\nwould be taken away. If the outcome was of that sort, they did not want\r\ntheir enemies to enjoy and avail themselves of their goods, so they had\r\nintended to eat them themselves. For if they should conquer the\r\nLacandones in battle, they would go to their villages and take away all\r\nthat they had, so that they would feel no lack of what they had already\r\neaten in their own houses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCortes Takes Leave of them in a Friendly Spirit. \"Don Fernando Cortes\r\nsaid to them that he was much grieved by their wars and quarrels, and\r\nthat, because he was forced to continue his journey, he could not stop,\r\nnor could he aid them and defend them against those enemies of theirs.\r\nBut, he added, had the situation been otherwise, he would have done so,\r\nand they would see, what they could not well imagine, how he would\r\nleave the Lacandones well punished and these Indians in peace and\r\nsecurity in their houses.\"\r\n\r\n\"With these affectionate speeches, and seeing that no harm was done to\r\nthem, those Indians were greatly contented. They gave thanks, after\r\ntheir fashion, to Cortes and his men, and at the same time, they gave\r\nhim guides so that he might proceed with his army, which he did. Other\r\nlarge pueblos were encountered which, like this one from which they\r\nstarted out, they called the Mazotecas. This is the same as Villages of\r\nDeer, and the name was given because of the large numbers there are in\r\nthat level country whence they set out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Deer Hunt. \"The deer ran away so little and were so free from\r\nfright at the men that our soldiers on horseback were able to come up\r\nwith them and kill them as they wished. In this way the men killed many\r\nof them and ate them for some days after. The Indian guides, who were\r\nshowing the Spaniards everything and all those villages of their people\r\nwhich had been burned and razed, on being asked why it was that having\r\nso many deer at hand, they permitted them to be so tame. The Indians\r\nreplied that in their villages they held the deer to be gods, for their\r\ngreatest idol had appeared to them in that form and commanded them not\r\nto kill the deer, nor frighten them. They had executed this command,\r\nand as a result the deer were not easily scared, nor did they flee from\r\nthe soldiers, and they were very numerous....\"\r\n\r\n\"Cortes and his men set forth from these villages of the Mazotecas and\r\nfrom the province of Acalan (which in after years, during the conquest\r\nof the Kingdom of Yucatan, was subjected by Captain Francisco de Tamayo\r\nPacheco, who had come out in quest of it from the City of Merida)....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Army of Cortes Proceeds on its Way. \"Once more the army of Cortes\r\nwent forward through rough and broken country. As always, he sent\r\ncamp-scouts ahead on horseback and single soldiers afoot; these\r\nencountered two Indians from another village further on, who were out\r\nhunting and were carrying a large lion [puma, jaguar?] as well as a\r\ngreat quantity of iguanas, which are a kind of small serpent and very\r\ngood to eat. These Indians led them [the army] to their village, and\r\nfrom there the army took its road towards the mountains, asking all\r\nwhom they met whether they had seen bearded men like them, for they\r\nwere seeking them. Some of the Indians who were questioned replied,\r\nsaying: That those of whom they spoke were ahead, and were journeying\r\nin the same direction....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lake. \"When the army left the place where it had spent the night,\r\nand while it was mounting the slope of the mountains, but a short time\r\nhad elapsed when those in the vanguard began to catch glimpses of great\r\nLaguna, in the middle of which was an island with a large town, which,\r\nas was afterwards learned, was the chief place of that whole Province\r\nof Itza. [These were the people who had withdrawn one hundred years\r\nbefore from Yucatan, as has been said.] And it was possible to enter\r\nthis town only by means of boats.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThey Capture an Indian. \"The camp-scouts had by now reached the shore\r\nof the Lake itself, and they brought to Cortes an Indian whom one Pedro\r\nde Ayuda, one of the explorers, had taken from a canoe. Then Cortes\r\nasked this captured Indian (as he did to all the rest) whether or not\r\nthe Spaniards or Bearded Men, like him and his men, had been through\r\nthat region or were still in it, as he had been given to understand was\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\n\"The Indian replied that in that town nothing was known of such men as\r\nthey. He added, that if they wished to go to the town, there were some\r\ncultivated fields near the largest arm of the Lake where they could\r\ntake many boats from the laborers who were tilling their fields, and he\r\noffered to lead them thither if it pleased them that he should do so.\r\n\r\n\"Don Fernando Cortes, with twelve crossbowmen, followed this Indian on\r\nfoot by a very bad path which, after passing for a long distance\r\nthrough swamps with mud up to the knee, at length led to the water. And\r\nbecause the party had delayed a long time in reaching the farms, on\r\naccount of the badness of the path, it was discovered by the laborers,\r\nwho, judging that harm was intended, fled into their canoes and made\r\nfor the island in the Lake, rowing as hard as possible.\r\n\r\n\"The army encamped in the farms on the shore of the Lake and fortified\r\nitself very well, because that Indian guide had told Cortes that the\r\nItzas were a people well skilled in war and that they were feared by\r\nthe whole region. And also this Indian told the Spaniards that if they\r\nwould let him go he would cross to the city in his canoe and would\r\nspeak to Canek, Lord of those Lands of the Itzas, and would tell him of\r\ntheir intention, and of their arrival.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indian is Sent to Tayasal. \"Cortes acceded to this request, and\r\ngave orders that he should be set free. At midnight the Indian returned\r\nto the army. As it was two leagues from mainland to the Island or\r\n_Peten_ (as they called it), he could not return earlier. He brought\r\nwith him two chiefs of that City who came to visit Cortes by order of\r\nCanek, who had told them to see on his behalf the Captain General of\r\nthat army and learn from his lips what it was he wished.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Indians Come to Cortes from Tayasal. \"Don Fernando Cortes gave\r\nthese personages some Spanish soldiers as hostages, so that the Canek\r\nor Lord might be able to come to the Royal camp. And after Cortes had\r\ntreated them with so much courtesy, kindness, and graciousness that\r\nthose Indians were delighted with him, as well as with the Spaniards'\r\nbeards, clothes, arms, and horses, he took leave of them and they went\r\naway. And on the following day Canek came to the camp with thirty-two\r\nchiefs and many _Zamaguales_ or common people, who came in their\r\ncanoes, bringing with them the Spanish hostages and without showing any\r\nsigns of fear or of hostility.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCanek himself Comes and is Courteously Received. \"Don Fernando Cortes\r\nreceived Canek with much love and urbanity. After saluting one another,\r\nand speaking by means of interpreters, Cortes, to honor him and to show\r\nCanek how the Christians adored their God, had a mass sung with all\r\nsolemnity to the sound of the reed instruments, sackbuts, or flageolets\r\nwhich he had with him, and he had out his best table ornaments, so as\r\nto treat Canek with great majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCanek Hears Mass and Promises to Put away his Idols. \"Canek listened to\r\nthe mass with great attention and took good notice of the Ceremonies,\r\ndecorations, and the altar-service, and he derived much pleasure from\r\nwhat was shown him. He praised highly the music, saying that such a\r\nthing had never been heard before, and those who were with him were\r\nastonished and fascinated at seeing and hearing it.\r\n\r\n\"And when the religious and clerics had finished the divine office,\r\nthey preached to Canek, urging him to put away his idols and see how\r\ngood was the Law of God.... They told Canek that his idols were but\r\npieces of stone or old wood harboring demons and that he was deceived\r\nin them and that all who believed in them would lose their souls and\r\nwould be carried to the Infernal regions.\r\n\r\n\"Canek replied that he would willingly leave his Idols and that he\r\nwished to know the manner in which they venerated the True God of whom\r\nthey told him and whom they declared unto him, and he asked for a cross\r\nin order to place it in his village. Don Fernando Cortes told him that\r\nsoon it would be given to him, as it had been done in the other pueblos\r\nthrough which they had passed. The Padres said the same and added that\r\nas soon as possible men should be sent to him to instruct him and all\r\nhis vassals in the Faith of Christ our Lord, for at present it could\r\nnot be done, as many important things were pressing....\r\n\r\n\"Don Fernando Cortes made to Canek a very full and eloquent speech\r\nabout the Emperor Charles V and his many dominions and his great\r\nsovereign power; Cortes begged Canek and urged him with affectionate\r\narguments to be the vassal of the Emperor, as were already the Lords of\r\nthe great Kingdom of Mexico and many others. Canek replied, saying that\r\nhe thus gave himself up; for, many years before, men of Tabasco, when\r\npassing through his lands into the wilderness, had told him that\r\ncertain Strangers had arrived at their villages and that they fought\r\nmuch and well, for they had conquered the Tabascans in three battles.\r\n\r\n\"And Cortes told Canek that he himself was the Captain of those of whom\r\nthe Tabascans spoke, and that he had conquered them and subjected them\r\nto his will. Thereupon the conversation came to a close and they all\r\nsat down to eat with much ostentatious magnificence. And it was\r\nsuitable that it should be so, in order that those Indians might come\r\nto esteem and fear the Spaniards, and thus know how majestic was their\r\nKing.\r\n\r\n\"Canek ordered his vassals to bring from the canoes birds, fishes,\r\ncakes, honey, and gold (though only a little of the latter), and beads\r\nof red snail-shells, which the Indians value highly. They ate, and\r\nCortes gave Canek a shirt, and a cap of black velvet, and some little\r\nthings of iron, such as scissors and knives.\r\n\r\n\"Once again Don Fernando Cortes asked Canek about some Spaniards of his\r\nwho should be on the coast of the sea, not far from there. To this\r\nCanek replied that he indeed had news of them and that he would give\r\nCortes a man who should lead him to where they were without wandering\r\nfrom the road, although it was rough and bad on account of the great\r\nforests, rivers, and marshes that had to be traversed; once the sea was\r\nreached the going would not be so difficult.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCortes Goes to Tayasal with Canek. \"Don Fernando Cortes thanked him\r\nvery much, but told him that the horses could not go in the canoes in\r\norder to cross the Lake and continue their journey. Canek replied that\r\nafter a matter of three leagues the Lake would be left behind, and he\r\nbegged that while the army was marching around by land Don Fernando\r\nCortes should come with him to his city to see him burn the idols. Don\r\nFernando Cortes did so, against the advice of all his captains, who\r\nheld that he was of great foolhardiness and overconfidence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Itzas Give Cortes News of Olid. \"Cortes embarked with thirty\r\ncrossbowmen, Canek, and the chief Indians for the town on the Island,\r\nwhich town was very large, and from a long way off they saw the\r\nwhiteness of its many houses and adoratoria. And on reaching the town\r\nCanek received Cortes with great rejoicing, regaling him, as well as he\r\ncould, with a present of poor gold of little value (for it is not found\r\nin that country) and some mantles. And there the Indians informed\r\nCortes of where the two villages of the Bearded Men (as they call the\r\nSpaniards) were. They said that one of them was called Pueblo de Nito\r\n(Ferns) and was on the coast to the north, while the other was called\r\nPueblo de Naco and was inland.\r\n\r\n\"This news brought great joy to Cortes and his men on account of the\r\ngreat desire they all had to find the Spaniards in search of whom they\r\nhad undertaken this perilous journey.\r\n\r\n\"Those of the army who were marching along the shore of the Lake went\r\nwith great care, being suspicious lest the affability of Canek was but\r\na piece of premeditated craftiness to enable him to perpetrate some\r\ntreachery.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCortes Takes Leave of Canek, Leaving Morzillo. \"But things did not take\r\nsuch a course as they had feared. Indeed, Don Fernando Cortes was ahead\r\nof time (at the meeting place) with all his crossbowmen, and when he\r\njoined with the main body of his army he rid the rest of all the\r\nanxiety they had suffered during his absence.\r\n\r\n\"He took leave of Canek and the Itza Indians who had accompanied him to\r\nthe mainland. He left in their charge his horse Morzillo, which had\r\nbeen injured in the ankle, charging them to take good care of him, and\r\nto cure him. Cortes said that he would send after the horse from the\r\nplace where he should meet those Spaniards for whom he was seeking.\r\nSuch horses were, he said, esteemed highly, for it was a good horse.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIdols not Burnt. \"There was no burning of the idols, nor anything else\r\nof the sort, in that city of Tayasal (as they call it) or Chief City of\r\nCanek. Some say, however, that the idols were burnt in the presence of\r\nCortes, but in truth, from the time when he left his horse among the\r\nItza Infidels, they had a worse and more abominable idol than they had\r\nhad before, as we shall see later....\"[3.6]\r\n\r\n\r\nCortes Arrives in Honduras. \"With ... innumerable other excessive\r\ntrials, at the end of many days, they arrived at Honduras and met the\r\nSpaniards in search of whom they had come, in the villages of Naco and\r\nNito, which Gil Gonzalez de Avila and Christoval de Olid had settled\r\nwith Spaniards. The town of Nito was founded by Avila and was called\r\nSan Gil de Buena Vista. All that happened is to be found and read in\r\nthe Histories of the Indies and it does not concern this History.\r\n\r\n\"Only this concerns us: on account of a variety of circumstances Don\r\nFernando Cortes neither returned himself through the land of the Itzas,\r\nnor did he send after his horse, nor did he send the Missionary Fathers\r\nto the Itzas, as he had offered to do.... So that that wretched little\r\nruler, Lord of the Itzas or Canek, and all his subjects, remained as\r\nbarbarous and idolatrous as they were before, and even daily grew more\r\nso, as well as becoming more horrible, cruel, atrocious, and\r\nformidable. And in this state we must leave them until the time comes\r\nfor us once more to speak of them....\"\r\n\r\nThough this account of the entrada made by Cortes into the country of\r\nthe Itzas seems full enough, it differs, nevertheless, from some of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\nComparison of Villagutierre with Other Authorities. In the first place\r\nVillagutierre tells us that the motive which led Cortes into sending an\r\nexpedition to Honduras was that \"it was a very good land,\" and when,\r\nbecause of Olid's treachery, it became necessary for him to go thither\r\nhimself, Villagutierre says he took four hundred Spaniards and thirty\r\nhorses. Bernal Diaz (vol. iv, p. 283 ff.) differs widely from this\r\naccount in several respects. He says that Cortes hoped to find a\r\npassage to the Spice Islands, and that it was for that purpose that he\r\nsent out Olid, on whom he believed he could rely. Olid, though brave\r\nenough, was not a wise or faithful man. He fell a victim to the\r\nmachinations of Diego Velazquez, Governor of Cuba, who was a mortal\r\nenemy of Cortes.\r\n\r\nAccording to Cogolludo (lib. i, cap. 13) it was very much against the\r\nadvice of his associates in Mexico that Cortes went in person to\r\nHonduras. He tells us that the vanguard of the Spaniards, after\r\ncapturing ten Indian men and two Indian women, who were treated kindly,\r\nsent one of their canoes to the island of Tayasal with six Indians and\r\ntwo Spaniards, who were to give Canek some small Castilian presents. As\r\na result of this, when the main body of the army, under Cortes himself,\r\nreached the shore of the lake, Canek and several of his chiefs were\r\nwaiting for them. The rest of the account of Cogolludo is the same as\r\nthat of Villagutierre.\r\n\r\nIn his Fifth Letter, Cortes furnishes some interesting details with\r\nwhich we will complete our account of the first entrada into the Itza\r\nterritory. He tells us (The Letters of Cortes to Charles V, MacNutt's\r\ntranslation, vol. ii, p. 259) that Apospolon. Lord of Izancanac, first\r\npretended to be dead, being in fear of Cortes, but that later he took\r\nthe Spaniards to Izancanac, which was \"quite large, and has many\r\nmosques.\" This Apospolon was a sort of merchant prince and had\r\nwidespread trading connections. At Nito, where Cortes met Gil Gonzalez\r\nde Avila, a whole quarter \"was peopled with his agents under command of\r\none of his brothers.\" The articles of trade were, of course, only such\r\nthings as cocoa, mantles, red shells, and dyes. As the people of\r\nIzancanac were near neighbors of the Itzas, and as the latter lay\r\nbetween them and Nito, it seems as if it must have been almost\r\ninevitable that the two tribes, the subjects of Apospolon and those of\r\nCanek, should have had much in common.\r\n\r\nWhen Cortes left Izancanac he passed through the fortified village, the\r\nname of which no one mentions, and later came to that of Tiac, which\r\nwas still larger and very well built. From the province of Mazatlan (in\r\nwhich was Tiac) to that of Taiza (Itza) was a matter of four nights. At\r\nlength he reached the lake, which he thought to be an arm of the sea,\r\nand from the shore he saw Tayasal. He found that his scouts had\r\ncaptured an Indian, who gave valuable information. From this point the\r\naccount of Cortes agrees absolutely with that of Villagutierre, even to\r\nthe number of the crossbowmen (twelve) whom Cortes took with him.\r\n\r\nNow that we have compared all the important accounts of this entrada we\r\nmust summarize our impressions. In the first place it is clear enough\r\nthat a possibility may exist of Villagutierre having copied Cogolludo\r\nminutely. In the second place it is equally clear that in those\r\ninstances where Villagutierre puts aside Cogolludo he draws from\r\nsomeone else of even more authority. Therefore we may safely believe\r\nthat in quoting the accounts of various events given by Villagutierre\r\nwe shall be availing ourselves of the best possible information.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanek's Attitude toward Cortes. At the time when Cortes was at Tayasal\r\n(1525) a tolerant attitude toward the white men was prevalent. Far from\r\nresenting the proposed change in religion, the Canek of that day seems\r\nrather to have welcomed the new faith, and one can readily believe that\r\nhad Cortes been able to do all that he promised, an early\r\nChristianization of the Itzas would have taken place. Instead, however,\r\nas we shall see, their idolatrous ways were to continue for many\r\ndecades, and their attitude was to suffer a great change which, we must\r\nconcede, is largely to be accounted for by Spanish brutality and bad\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is all in harmony with what Gomara says. He especially\r\nemphasizes the friendly attitude of Canek. (Gomara, 1826, vol. ii, p.\r\n136 ff.)[3.7]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                THE ENTRADA OF FRANCISCO DE MONTEJO AND\r\n                    HIS SON, AND THE ARRIVAL OF THE\r\n                         FRANCISCANS, 1526-1542\r\n\r\n\r\nFrancisco de Montejo and his Son. Although northern Yucatan was reduced\r\nto the condition of an orderly Spanish possession some one hundred and\r\nfifty years before the Peten region, it was done, nevertheless, only at\r\nthe cost of many years of desperate struggling. Two men, Don Francisco\r\nde Montejo the Elder and Don Francisco de Montejo the Younger, his son,\r\nwere the leading figures in the undertaking. The elder Montejo seems to\r\nhave been a man of gentle birth and of fairly good property. He came to\r\nAmerica about 1514 under Pedrarias Davila. Soon after that, however, he\r\nleft Davila and settled in Cuba, where he served under Velazquez. He\r\nalso served, a few years later, under Cortes in Mexico.\r\n\r\nSoon after the granting of a patent or general order Francisco de\r\nMontejo the Elder set forth on his undertaking. Several officials were\r\nappointed to accompany him. Alonso Davila was Contador (Paymaster),\r\nPedro de Lima was Tesorero (Treasurer), and Hernando Moreno de Quito\r\nwas Veedor de las Fundiciones (Overseer of the Smelters). (Cogolludo,\r\np. 73.)[4.1] Of these three offices the last was a sinecure by reason\r\nof the absence of mines in Yucatan. Davila had taken an active part in\r\nthe conquest of Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nMontejo's Preparations and Sacrifices. The expedition numbered some\r\nfour hundred soldiers, in addition to the crews who manned the four\r\nships. The expense, all borne by Montejo, was heavy. To furnish the\r\nnecessary arms, horses, and munitions the Adelantado found himself\r\nobliged to sell a Mayorazgo (entailed estate) yielding one thousand\r\nducats a year ($2500, equal to about $10,000 of modern money). The\r\nseamen received pay, but the rest of the expedition received no money,\r\ndepending on their fortune in the New World for remuneration. Only one\r\ncleric, Francisco Hernandez, accompanied the expedition; he was its\r\nchaplain. He later attributed the failure of the expedition to the lack\r\nof priests.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe Sets out. Setting out in 1527, the expedition arrived at Cozumel,\r\nwhere a landing was effected. There, as elsewhere, the Spaniards found\r\nthemselves at a great disadvantage in having no interpreter. By various\r\nmakeshifts, however, they made themselves understood, and poor Montejo,\r\nmisled by the seeming docility of the natives, flattered himself that\r\nhe had an easy task before him.\r\n\r\n\r\nMontejo and his Men Go along the Shore of Yucatan. Skirting the eastern\r\nshore of Yucatan, the fleet arrived at a point near the first site of\r\nValladolid, where all the soldiers landed, leaving the seamen to guard\r\nthe ships and supplies. What seemed a sufficient number of horses,\r\nmunitions, and provisions was taken. As usual on such occasions, the\r\nfirst thing to be done was to take formal possession of the land for\r\nthe King of Castile. Accordingly appropriate ceremonies were carried\r\nthrough, and the standard bearer, Gonzalo Nieto, unfurled the royal\r\nbanner. Cogolludo is very definite as to the region in which the\r\nconquest of Yucatan had its beginning. Valladolid,[4.2] not Bakhalal or\r\nCampeche, is, he says, the site of the first operations. He quotes as\r\nhis authority on this point the Bachiller Valencia, a native of\r\nValladolid, whose Relacion was made in 1639. Coni, a village in the\r\nprovince of Choaca,[4.3] was reached. Some of the chiefs of the region\r\ncame to see the Adelantado and were well received; they, however, were\r\ntreacherously minded, but their attempt to kill or injure Montejo was\r\nfoiled. From Coni the Spaniards went to the village of Choaca, where\r\ntheir real trials began.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the Campaign. In their early wanderings the Spaniards\r\nsuffered greatly from lack of proper water and from bad roads. Often\r\nthey found the villages deserted by their inhabitants or, still worse,\r\nbristling with armed warriors. Led by an Indian whom they had picked up\r\nat Coni, Montejo and his followers traveled through the province of\r\nChoaca to a place called Ake. On the way they ran into an ambush of\r\narmed Indians. The weapons of these latter consisted of arrows hardened\r\nby fire, lances with sharp flint points, two-handed swords of very hard\r\nwood, and shields made of very large tortoise shells adorned with snail\r\nshells and antlers; their bodies were naked save for breech clouts of\r\nflimsy material, and they were all painted. Since the Indians were as\r\nstubborn as they were brave, and as the Spaniards found themselves at a\r\ndisadvantage, being unable to use their horses properly on account of\r\nthe rough country, the fight was a fierce one; the Adelantado himself\r\nacted well, showing the less experienced of his followers the best way\r\nto combat the Indians. The Spaniards, greatly outnumbered, kept up the\r\nfight all day, receiving many lance wounds in their faces and bodies;\r\nmany died; more were seriously wounded. The horses and bloodhounds also\r\nsuffered greatly. Only after a second day of fighting did the Indians\r\nfinally flee, leaving twelve hundred of their companions dead behind\r\nthem. This first victory over the Indians took place in the last weeks\r\nof 1527. Cogolludo dwells at great length on the errors of Herrera\r\n(Dec. ix, lib. iii, cap. 3) concerning the founding of Tihoo or Merida\r\nand of Chichen Itza. According to Herrera, Montejo went to Tihoo, where\r\nhe came into contact with the Cheles, who showed him Chichen Itza,\r\nseven leagues away. The Tutul Xiu, Lords of Mani, were then ruling\r\nthere, and with them, Herrera says, the Spaniards made a peaceful\r\narrangement. All this, according to Cogolludo, is wrong. In the opinion\r\nof Cogolludo, events were as follows. After the battle of Ake, Montejo\r\ndetermined to proceed cautiously and to endeavor by peaceful means to\r\nwin over the natives to obedience to the king. Slowly he made his way\r\nto Chichen Itza, which, by reason of its great buildings, seemed to him\r\na suitable place for one of the two fortresses he was to build. Having\r\nfortified himself against attacks, he set about subduing the country.\r\nHe managed to win the friendship of the Indians of that neighborhood. A\r\nvillage of Spaniards with houses built after the native plan was\r\nerected. The dwellings were made of vertical wooden logs and had\r\npalm-leaf roofs. One hundred and seventy Spaniards were left in the new\r\nsettlement. One of the first things done was to divide the land among\r\nthem. Cogolludo thinks that the name first given to the new village was\r\nthat of Salamanca. Misled by the seeming peacefulness of the Indians,\r\nMontejo determined to divide them up into _encomiendas_. The plan was\r\ncarried out, to the secret disgust of the Indians, who determined to\r\nget free as soon as an opportunity offered.\r\n\r\n\r\nDavila and Vazquez Search vainly for Gold in the Region of Chetemal.\r\nFrom the map which Montejo had with him it was learned that there were\r\ngold mines in the vicinity of Bakhalal, which place the Indians called\r\nVaymil or Chetemal. Because no sign of gold had been seen in that part\r\nof the country through which they had hitherto been, the soldiers were\r\ngetting downhearted, and Montejo determined to send a party in search\r\nof mines. Captain Alonso Davila, the Royal Paymaster, with fifty\r\nSpaniards and sixteen horses, was sent to found a village at a place\r\ncalled Tulma (Tuloom?) in the province of Cochva. A mine expert, one\r\nFrancisco Vazquez, accompanied the party in the hopes of earning the\r\nreward of three hundred ducats which Montejo offered to the discoverer\r\nof gold mines. When Tulma was reached it was found to be entirely\r\nunsuitable for a village, and the explorers went on to the now deserted\r\ntown of Chable, which was a place reported to have gold mines. The\r\ncacique of Chable received them well; but the cacique of Chetemal was\r\nbellicose and would give no aid when Montejo sent to find out whether\r\nthere were gold mines at Bakhalal, a town in his domain. With twenty\r\nmen and eight horses the Adelantado set forth to punish this chief. At\r\nthe end of a hard journey he found Chetemal deserted.\r\n\r\n\r\nFoundation of Villa Real de Chetemal. Chetemal, however, seemed to have\r\nbeen admirably adapted for the site of a town, and so, when the rest of\r\nhis men, together with some Indians, had arrived from Chable, the town\r\nof Villa Real de Chetemal was established by Davila. The cacique of\r\nChetemal was treacherous in his intentions; several skirmishes took\r\nplace between his men and the Spaniards, in which the latter, through\r\nsuperior arms, were the victors. An attempt made by Davila to get to\r\nMontejo a report of all that had been done in the last two months was\r\nfoiled by some Indians, who killed Davila's messengers.\r\n\r\n\r\nHardships of those who Were at Chichen. Meanwhile those Spaniards who\r\nhad remained behind with the Adelantado in Chichen Itza were also in\r\ngrave straits, not only because of the hostility and ill-will of the\r\nIndians, but also because of the lack of various things they had\r\nbrought from Spain but had been left behind in their ships which were\r\nnot now to be reached. Their condition daily grew worse.\r\n\r\nDavila and his men wandered back and forth between Villa Real and\r\nChable (where the Indians were more or less friendly) in search of gold\r\nand in the hope of establishing their power. At length even the Indians\r\nof Chable grew weary of them, and the Spaniards under Davila set off on\r\ntheir journeys once more. Finally they came to Bakhalal, where some\r\nseemingly friendly Indian chiefs offered to carry letters to Montejo.\r\nThey, however, like all the rest, were traitorous, and the Indians of\r\nthe province of Cochva were so turbulent that Davila determined to make\r\nwar on them. To do this he had the help of the chief men of Vaymil, and\r\nhe hoped for that of those of Chable. When he returned to the latter\r\nplace, he found that it had rebelled against his authority.\r\n\r\n\r\nContinual Misfortunes. In the events which follow one note, misfortune,\r\nmakes itself heard above the confusion. Battles, skirmishes, and\r\nmurders filled the lives of Davila and his men. Their wanderings lay\r\nmainly in the region of the province of Bakhalal. (Cogolludo, lib. ii,\r\ncap. viii.) Chable and Villa Real de Chetemal were the places they most\r\noften visited. In many cases villages were found to be deserted. All\r\nthrough the discouraging period Davila was seeking for some means of\r\nletting Montejo know the straits he was in. Once more he found Indians\r\nwhom he believed to be willing to act as messengers, and once again he\r\nwas tricked. Worse even than this was the unmistakable evidence that\r\nthe Indians were making elaborate preparations to attack Villa Real.\r\nThe fact that one of their own chiefs was being held as a hostage for\r\nthe safe delivery of the letters did not seem to deter them in the\r\nleast. One fortunate circumstance, however, does appear in this mass of\r\nmisfortunes: Davila was forewarned of his danger, for he sent out\r\nFrancisco Vazquez with ten men in seven canoes to get supplies. Two of\r\nthe party were killed by Indians; the remainder returned to Villa Real\r\nwith at least a small amount of supplies.\r\n\r\nIf Davila and his men were badly off in Villa Real, Montejo and his\r\nparty at Chichen Itza were equally if not more precariously situated.\r\nThe chief causes of their misfortunes were the lack of men, and of the\r\nmost common necessities, the want of certainty as to the best course to\r\nbe followed, and the knowledge on the part of the Indians that the\r\nnumber of the Spaniards was daily growing less on account of the\r\nceaseless skirmishes. Food was so scarce that parties had to be formed\r\non purpose to make sallies from the fortifications in search of it. As\r\nCogolludo (p. 86) graphically puts it, \"Their dinners now cost them\r\ntheir life-blood.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough, as we have already seen, centralized power was at an end long\r\nsince in the peninsula, a revival of the old-time feeling of unity is\r\nto be seen in the determination the Mayas had to get rid of the\r\nSpaniards. Cogolludo (p. 87) says, \"For this purpose almost all the\r\npeople of that land had made an agreement, so that the multitude [of\r\nIndians] was very great. The Indians who led the attack were of a\r\nvigorous and proud nature, and so, confident in their great number,\r\nthey surrounded the Spaniards, who, in no direction, could be reached\r\nby help.\" At length, seeing themselves faced with the choice of dying\r\nby inches from starvation or of being put to death fighting their\r\nenemies bravely, the Spaniards determined to make a sally when as good\r\nan opportunity as possible should present itself. Both sides were\r\ndesperate: the invaders were fighting for their lives; the Indians for\r\ntheir liberty. The havoc wrought by the superior arms of the Spaniards\r\nwas, however, more than counterbalanced by the overwhelming numbers of\r\nthe Indians. At last, seeing the utter hopelessness of further efforts,\r\nMontejo gave the signal to retreat. One hundred and fifty soldiers died\r\nat the hands of the Indians in this engagement. An anecdote which\r\nCogolludo tells as an explanation of the unity and determination of the\r\nIndians is a possible light upon the cause of their resistance. A\r\ncacique named Cupul, in the early days of the Spanish occupation of\r\nChichen Itza, feigned friendliness toward the invaders and went about\r\nfreely among them. One day, when Montejo was off his guard, Cupul went\r\nup behind him, snatched his sword away, and tried to kill him.\r\nFortunately a Spaniard, one Bias Gonzalez, cut off Cupul's arm just in\r\ntime to prevent the blow. It was to avenge the injury thus done to a\r\nchief that the Indians shut off the Spaniards' food supply.\r\n\r\n\r\nChichen Itza and Villa Real both Deserted. For our purpose it is\r\nunnecessary to give further details of the first expedition of Montejo.\r\nWe need only say that both the settlements made by the Spaniards,\r\nChichen Itza and Villa Real de Chetemal, were deserted for the time\r\nbeing. Cogolludo, after reviewing the various accounts of the further\r\nwanderings of Montejo and his son, Francisco Montejo the Younger, comes\r\nto the conclusion that the son remained at a port called Zilam, while\r\nhis father went by sea to Campeche (Kin Pech), where he remained till\r\n1534 without entirely deserting Yucatan. He did go, however, to New\r\nSpain in an effort to get more men so that he might continue the\r\nconquest. Those whom he already had remained at Campeche. Cogolludo's\r\nauthority for these statements are the depositions written by Gonzalo\r\nNieto and Bias Gonzalez, who were two soldiers of the Adelantado's\r\nforces.\r\n\r\n\r\nDavila Goes to Honduras. Captain Alonso Davila stayed in Villa Real de\r\nChetemal until 1532, constantly suffering from hunger and his struggles\r\nwith the natives. His efforts to communicate with the Adelantado were\r\nconstant. Finally it was decided to move to some place nearer Honduras.\r\nAs no suitable place for a settlement was found, Davila and his\r\nfollowers went to the town of Trujillo in Honduras. On the journey they\r\nlacked for every comfort and even for proper food. When they reached\r\nTrujillo they found the people there little better off than they.\r\nDavila agreed with Andres de Zerezeda, who was governing Trujillo, that\r\na vessel should be built to be sent out in search of the Adelantado and\r\nalso for things from Spain. At about this time two ships from Cuba\r\nbrought news of the discovery of Peru, and in one of these ships Davila\r\nand his men went off. Ultimately they rejoined the Adelantado at\r\nCampeche.\r\n\r\nEven after he was rejoined by Davila and his followers at Campeche,\r\nMontejo still had plenty of trouble with the natives. Like all the\r\nrest, the Indians of Campeche were bitterly opposed to the Spaniards\r\nand gave them much trouble. It is pleasant to know that Queen Juana\r\nrecognized the sacrifices made by Montejo in a cedula given at Ocana on\r\nApril 24, 1534.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Elder Montejo Goes to Tabasco in 1535. Nothing daunted by all his\r\nmisfortunes, the Adelantado bought some ships and gathered some\r\nsoldiers to continue his conquest. In New Spain, also, he obtained new\r\nsupplies of munitions and other necessary things. Apparently Montejo\r\nthe Elder was ordered to pacify the province of Tabasco, which was in\r\nrevolt. As a result of this Tabasco became, and for a long time\r\nremained, a part of the province of Yucatan. The ships, under Gonzalo\r\nNieto, went on to Campeche to get all the Spaniards there were in\r\nYucatan and bring them to Tabasco, for the subjugating of that province\r\nwas found to be more difficult than had at first been thought. The\r\nmotive which led Montejo thus to make sure of his grasp on Tabasco\r\nspeaks well for his generalship: he knew only too well how few were the\r\nmen available as fighters, and so he wished to make sure that there\r\nwere no revolted provinces in his rear at the time when he should begin\r\nagain his attack on Yucatan.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1535 the Spaniards deserted Yucatan proper, retiring to\r\nChampoton[4.4] and to Tabasco.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Franciscans Enter Yucatan, 1535. At this juncture a very important\r\nincident took place: the Religious of the Order of San Francisco\r\nentered Yucatan. (Cogolludo, lib. ii, cap. 12.) At that time,\r\n1534-1535, Antonio de Mendoza[4.5] was in possession of the post of\r\nViceroy of New Spain, and he had long before received orders from Queen\r\nJuana signed at Madrid, September 22, 1530, to the effect that\r\nReligious must at once be sent to Yucatan to fulfill the conditions\r\nunder which that province had been granted to Francisco de Montejo. As\r\nthere were no Religious in Yucatan there was nothing for Mendoza to do\r\nbut send some from his own dominions. When the project was made known\r\nit was answered by Fray Jacobo de Testera, who, although he was the\r\noccupant of a high post in Mexico, offered to go to Yucatan to\r\nevangelize the country. In 1531 he, with Fray Lorencio de Bienvenida\r\nand two others, went to Tabasco. On March 18 of the same year they\r\nreached Champoton. Having asked leave of the natives to enter, the\r\nMexican Indians in the party were welcomed by those of Champoton. The\r\nbeginning was fortunate enough; the end of the mission was unfortunate.\r\nThe cause of the change was the resentment the Indians felt against the\r\nPadres, who burned up their idols. Campeche was the farthest point from\r\nMexico that they reached. (Remesal, lib. v, cap. 6.) Disgruntled by\r\ntheir failure, the Padres finally returned to Mexico. Cogolludo is very\r\nexplicit as regards the exaggeration of Spanish cruelty by some\r\nwriters, notably Remesal, Las Casas, and others.\r\n\r\nIn 1536 another band of friars, led by Fray Antonio de Ciudad-Rodrigo,\r\npreached in Coazacoalco, Santa Maria de la Victoria de Tabasco,\r\nXicalango, Champoton, and Campeche, returning to New Spain two years\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\r\nRenewal of the Subjection of Yucatan by Montejo, 1537. Cogolludo (lib.\r\niii, cap. 1) expatiates upon the difficulty of setting an accurate date\r\nfor the renewal of the pacification of Yucatan. It is plain enough,\r\nhowever, that Montejo wisely decided to begin this time with Tabasco,\r\non which he already had a hold. This was accomplished with the aid of\r\nDiego de Contreras with a ship, men, and supplies. The task was\r\ncompleted by 1537. In all his undertakings Montejo seems to have been\r\nhampered by a scarcity of men, which may, as Cogolludo suggests, be\r\naccounted for by the recent discovery of Peru, with its alleged great\r\nwealth. There is some doubt as to whether Francisco de Montejo or his\r\nson led this second expedition; Cogolludo suggests that the former may\r\nhave gone to Yucatan in person to start the work and that he may then\r\nhave returned to Tabasco, leaving his son in charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nHostility of the Indians. Champoton was the place selected for the\r\nSpanish headquarters. The camp was established there in 1537.\r\nMochcovoh, Halach Uinic of the place, treated them well at first.\r\n(Landa, pp. 82-83.) Before very long, however, the latent hostility of\r\nthe Indians burst out and there was a battle which resulted in the\r\nflight of the Indians. The Spaniards foolishly neglected to follow up\r\nthis advantage, preferring to bury their not numerous dead. In the days\r\nwhich followed there was a cessation of hostilities, which seems to\r\nhave misled the Spaniards, who thought that the Indians were cowed. As\r\na matter of fact they were forming a great army composed of warriors\r\nfrom many neighboring districts. In the battle which was soon\r\nprecipitated the Spaniards were driven to their ships, and the royal\r\ncamp was sacked. Stung and enraged by the insults of the seemingly\r\nvictorious Indians, the Spaniards turned and faced them so boldly that\r\nthe victory, in the end, was a Spanish one. Most of the Spaniards went\r\nhome to their lands in New Spain after this battle; nineteen, however,\r\nremained at Champoton waiting for an opportunity to proceed with the\r\nconquest. Several of the names of these intrepid adventurers are given\r\nby Cogolludo (p. 117). They all speak, In their Relaciones, of the\r\nyounger Montejo as a good leader.\r\n\r\nMatters continued for some time in very much the same way as\r\nheretofore. Towns were founded; troubles with the Indians occurred; the\r\nAdelantado went back and forth between Tabasco and Champoton; Don\r\nFrancisco Montejo the Younger went to New Spain to get more soldiers,\r\nthings went on in a fairly satisfactory manner until 1539, when, with\r\nsome twenty cavalrymen from New Spain, Don Francisco went to Campeche.\r\nAt about this time the chief command and the powers laid upon him by\r\nthe king were passed by the Adelantado Francisco de Montejo to his son\r\nof the same name. The Instructions of the Adelantado are so important\r\nthat we will give an extract of them paragraph by paragraph as\r\ndescribed by Cogolludo.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Elder Montejo's Instructions to his Son\r\n\r\n1. You, my son Don Francisco de Montejo, are to do the following in\r\nyour conquest of Yucatan and Cozumel and in your fulfillment of the\r\npowers which I hold from His Majesty.\r\n\r\n2. You are to see that your men live like good Christians and speak\r\nwell of God, and you are to punish wrong-doers.\r\n\r\n3. On your arrival at San Pedro (Champoton) you are to punish any who\r\nmay have enslaved Indians against their will, and you are to thank the\r\nIndians of Champoton for having treated our men so well for two and\r\none-half years.\r\n\r\n4. Leaving the Indians of Champoton well contented, and taking with you\r\nsome of their chief men, you will go to Campeche, where you will tell\r\nthe leaders that you have come to take that land in His Majesty's name\r\nand mine in order to win it for the Holy Faith. You will punish those\r\nwho will have no knowledge of God and who will not obey His Majesty.\r\nThose who do come into the faith and are obedient you will favor and\r\nshelter. Then, taking two chiefs of the said _Pueblo_ and two of that\r\nof Champoton, you will let the rest go home; thereupon you will enter\r\nthe province of Acanul, taking great care to do no harm to the natives.\r\n\r\n5. In this province you will endeavor to meet a Lord called Vua\r\nChancan, who has always been a friend of the Christians and most\r\nhelpful in time of war. You will treat him very well, and will try to\r\nfind out through the other leaders of the province whether they wish\r\nwar. And if they do, you will give them to understand that you come in\r\npeace and that if they receive you in His Majesty's name and mine they\r\nwill be well treated and favored. If they do not yield you will have to\r\nmake war upon them.\r\n\r\n6. Having arrived at the _Pueblo_ of Tihoo, which is in the province of\r\nQuepeche, you will establish there a _Cabildo_ and Government if it\r\nseems to you that the region is such as to favor it. There you will\r\nlabor to bring the whole land to peace, and if some hold back you will\r\nmake war upon them in fulfillment of His Majesty's commands.\r\n\r\n7. Afterwards you are to pacify the provinces which are to serve the\r\nsaid City. They are those of Acanul, Chacan, Quepeche, Kin Chel,\r\nCocola, Tutul Xiu, and Kupules; these are the greatest provinces of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n8. You are to give _repartimientos_ to not more than one hundred men\r\nbecause the land is large and the Indians many. This city is to be the\r\nchief of all. Besides the _repartimientos_ which you make and besides\r\nthat which I have kept for myself, you will leave a number of villages,\r\nwithout giving them permanently, for the use of persons who most\r\nforward the service of His Majesty. It is customary to do so in new\r\nlands.\r\n\r\n9. And you are to make a general inspection of all that you conquer in\r\nthe provinces hereinbefore mentioned; you will especially be informed\r\nof the number and quality of villages and houses. In each village you\r\nwill establish Spanish citizens suitable for each village. You will\r\nalso make _Cedulas_ of _encomienda_ and _repartimiento_ wherever you\r\nthink best, in fulfillment of His Majesty's command.\r\n\r\n10. And having done all this, you will labor to see to it that all\r\nbuild their houses and other buildings well, and you the first of all,\r\nso that others may take your example. And you will endeavor to see that\r\nthe Indians are well treated and taught our Holy Catholic Faith and are\r\nmade to lose their bad habits.\r\n\r\n11. At the same time you are to open roads to the sea and between all\r\nthe principal cities. In all this you will place all the diligence and\r\ncare possible, because I trust you. Signed in this Royal City of\r\nChiapa, 1540.\r\n\r\n12. Furthermore you will grant me again the provinces of Tutul Xiu,\r\nTechaque, Campeche and the village of Champoton.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Younger Montejo Founds Campeche, 1540-1541. Before setting out with\r\nthe main body of his forces Don Francisco de Montejo, the son, sent\r\nfour picked men in advance to Campeche to ascertain the attitude of the\r\nIndians. At a place called Cihoo in the province of Telchac (Cogolludo,\r\npp. 126, 127) these scouts found some Indians fortified. They warned\r\nthe army of the danger. A fight took place in which the Spaniards were\r\nthe victors. They took the Indians' deserted town and recuperated there\r\nfor a number of days. From Cihoo, Montejo went to Campeche, where he\r\nestablished the town of San Francisco de Campeche in 1540 or 1541.\r\n\r\nAll that was necessary for the establishment of government at Campeche\r\nhaving been done, it was time for Don Francisco to attend to the\r\nfounding of Merida at Tihoo. He sent his cousin with fifty-seven or so\r\nmen to conquer it; he himself remained behind. There was some trouble\r\nwith the Indians, and it transpired that the friendship of a chief\r\nnamed Na Chancan, Lord of Acanul, was feigned. The Spaniards passed\r\nthrough the village of Pokbac.\r\n\r\n\r\nTutul Xiu of Mani Offers his Aid. Having reached Tihoo, the Spaniards\r\nestablished their camp on a hill near the present cathedral.\r\n(Cogolludo, lib. iii, cap. 6.) They had not been there long when some\r\nIndians brought the news that a large war-party was about to attack\r\nthem. The Spaniards resolved to be the aggressors; they went in search\r\nof their enemies and beat them in a sharp fight. On his return to\r\nTihoo, Montejo set his followers to work building the town. They were\r\nsoon interrupted once more, this time by the arrival of the Lord of\r\nMani, who came in peace. Voluntarily he submitted to Spanish authority\r\nand asked to be made a Christian. As it was the day of San Ildefonso,\r\nArchbishop of Toledo, the new town was placed under his patronage\r\nbecause of this good fortune. The date was February 23, 1541. Tutul Xiu\r\nsaid that he had been won over by the valor of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nAccompanying the Lord of Mani (Tutul Xiu) were numerous vassals whose\r\nnames are interesting for us. I give the spelling of Cogolludo (pp.\r\n130-131). They were: Ah Na Poot Xiu, son of Tutul Xiu; Ah Ziyah, a\r\ngovernor; and Ah Kin Chi, a priest. These three are said to have been\r\nlieutenants of Tutul Xiu at Mani itself. Others of the vassals were: Yi\r\nBan Can, Governor of the pueblo of TeKit; Pacab, Governor of Oxcutzcab;\r\nKan Caba of Panabchen, which is now deserted; Kupul of Zacalum; Nauat\r\nof Teab; Uluac Chan Cauich, whose home is unknown; Zon Ceh of Pencuyut;\r\nAhau Tuyu of Muna; Xul Cumche of TipiKal; Tucuch of Mama; Zit Couat of\r\nChumayel. Just before he left, Tutul Xiu promised to send ambassadors\r\nof his to other great lords in the country urging them to accept\r\nChristianity and Spanish sovereignty. He did as he said he would.\r\nAmbassadors were sent to the Cocomes of Zotuta and to other chiefs. The\r\nchief of Zotuta at this time was Nachi Cocom; he killed all the\r\nambassadors save Ah Kin Chi, who was sent back to Mani with the news.\r\n\r\nWhile the Indians of Mani and those of Zotuta were at odds, a number of\r\nIndians from the country around Tihoo came to yield obedience to the\r\nSpaniards. Warned by their ally, the Spaniards learned that Nachi Cocom\r\nhad made a league against the Spaniards, comprising all the people from\r\nthe country east of Tihoo as far as Ytzamal. In the end, according to\r\nCogolludo (p. 137), no less than seventy thousand hostile Indians came\r\nagainst the Spaniards. As a result of the great battle that took place\r\nthe main part of the Indians' resistance was destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFoundation of Merida and of Valladolid, 1542-1543. On the Feast of the\r\nKings, January 6, 1542, Senor Don Francisco de Montejo and Rodrigo\r\nAlvarez, scrivener, established the city of Merida with the entire\r\nprovince of Quepech subject to it. Aside from its Indian population,\r\nhowever, Merida had only one hundred citizens. Cogolludo (p. 137) gives\r\na complete list of the first Alcaldes and Regidores.\r\n\r\nOn March 13, 1542, Montejo made arrangements for the founding of the\r\ncity of Valladolid, a task which he intrusted to one of his relatives.\r\nIn May of the same year he himself set forth from Merida to subdue the\r\nCocomes of Zotuta or Sotuta, while at the same time another relative\r\nwent to conquer the province of Choaca, the inhabitants of which were\r\nvery warlike. After more or less resistance the Cocomes were beaten and\r\nthe city of Zotuta fell into Spanish hands.\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1543, the Cabildo elected the second set of municipal\r\nofficers for Merida. From that time the city increased in permanency;\r\n_solares_ or lots were given out; the Spanish rule was firm.\r\n\r\nOn May 28, 1543, the city of Valladolid in the province of Choaca was\r\nfounded and a church was established, the town being placed under the\r\nprotection of Nuestra Senora de los Remedios. Cogolludo (lib. iii, cap.\r\n14) gives a full list of all the officers and citizens.\r\n\r\nIt is uncertain where the site of the first settlement of Valladolid\r\nis. It is quite certain, however, that the city was soon moved from its\r\nfirst position \"six leagues from the sea.\" The reason why the site was\r\nchanged was the unhealthful locality in which the first settlement was\r\nplaced. The new site was the _pueblo_ of Zaqui, where the present city\r\nof Valladolid now stands. In 1544 the city of Salamanca de Bacalar was\r\nfounded on or near the site of Bakhalal.\r\n\r\n\r\nBishop Bartolome de las Casas Arrives in Yucatan. At this time,\r\n1544-1545, Bishop Bartolome de las Casas and his friars of the Order of\r\nSanto Domingo arrived in Yucatan, going first to Campeche and later\r\nspreading their influence through the country, the natives of which\r\ngreatly needed improvement. From this time onwards we may consider that\r\nthe Spanish rule was firmly established throughout the northern\r\nportions of the peninsula, although, as we shall see, a long time was\r\nstill to pass before the southern regions were subjected. Montejo and\r\nthose associated with him came no nearer to the Itzas than Bakhalal.\r\nAll this is not meant to imply that there were no further revolts and\r\nresistance against Spanish authority, for there still were sporadic\r\nefforts on the part of the Indians to maintain their freedom. In\r\nValladolid, for example, in the year 1546, there was a very serious\r\nrebellion, which was crushed only with great difficulty. (Landa, p.\r\n93.) In general, nevertheless, Spanish power daily grew more firm, and\r\nthe power of the Religious grew constantly greater, despite hostility\r\nfrom both Spaniards and Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                  THE ENTRADA OF PADRES FUENSALIDA AND\r\n                              ORBITA, 1618\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next entrada was made by two members of the Franciscan Order, which\r\nhas done so much in many parts of the world to bring unbelievers into\r\nthe Church. As we shall very shortly see, their coming inaugurated a\r\nnew period in the conquest of the Itzas.\r\n\r\nFrom lack of any sort of information we must assume that from 1524 to\r\n1614 the Itzas of Tayasal or Peten were unmolested by Spaniards. There\r\nare numerous hints of their formidableness during this period, and the\r\nevent of which we shall soon learn shows that they were not without a\r\ncertain grim humor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Name Canek. Cortes, when he visited Peten, found the governmental\r\npower in the hands of a personage bearing the name or title of Canek.\r\nCogolludo and Villagutierre both say that this term was a name arrived\r\nat by combining the family names of the ruler's parents. This seems to\r\nme difficult to believe. Rather, I think the word Canek to be a title.\r\nMy reason for so thinking is this: in 1524 the ruler was called Canek,\r\nand ninety years later the then ruler was also Canek. It could hardly\r\nhave been the same individual, and it is equally unlikely that the\r\nparents of two rulers should have exactly the same name. It is\r\npossible, of course, that the first king of Peten or Tayasal had the\r\nname of Canek, derived as the two historians suggest, and that this\r\nfamily name later took on the attributes of a title. The same thing\r\nhappened in the case of the Pharaohs, the Seleucidae, the Roman\r\nemperors (Caesar), and the Incas.\r\n\r\nWhile the northern part of the peninsula was being made a Spanish\r\ndominion, the southern woodland remained unconquered, causing much\r\nannoyance to the authorities. If we look upon the year 1545 as marking\r\nthe completion of the conquest of northern Yucatan, we may say that a\r\ncentury and a half elapsed before the subjection of the Itzas was\r\nconsummated. To gain an idea of the events of the time we can do\r\nnothing better than to give Villagutierre's account. (Lib. ii, cap. 1.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIncreased Power of the Itzas. \"It is now many years that the Barbarous\r\nItzaex,[5.1] more than any other Nation of Infidels, have been\r\nterrifying all those Provinces. For, since the time when D. Fernando\r\nCortes passed through their land and those events which have already\r\nbeen told happened to them, no further attempts had been made to bring\r\nabout their Reduction or to make war upon them in order to subjugate\r\nthem, and this was on account of the prohibition given by the King in\r\nCedulas and orders.\r\n\r\n\"They had increased greatly in numbers, pride, cruelty and Power,\r\nmaking war upon and capturing and eating others of the Gentile Nations\r\nwho dwelt in those Mountains and Forests, and also infesting, by their\r\nRaids, the Reduced and quiet Villages on the Confines of their Lands,\r\nand especially those of the Province of Yucatan, destroying them, and\r\ncausing the Indians and Spaniards great agitation.\r\n\r\n\"They trusted in the great Fortress and the great security they had in\r\ntheir Lake, and especially at the City or Great Village of Tayassal\r\nwhich was situated on the Peten or Island in the Lake; because of which\r\nnothing molested them nor was it possible even to pass near their\r\nConfines. And although the Governors of the Province of Yucatan\r\nregretted this extremely, yet they did not venture to make war upon\r\nthem because the King had prohibited it by his orders and Royal\r\nCedulas, as has been said elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mock Embassy from Tayasal. \"In the year 1614, while Don Antonio de\r\nFigueroa was governing those Provinces of Yucatan, some of the Itzaex\r\ncame to the City of Merida, feigning an embassy (?) in order to cover\r\nother and more private ends. Or perhaps because it seemed to them that\r\nthey could thereby make derision or sport of the Spaniards, they gave\r\nout that they had come voluntarily to render obedience to His Majesty,\r\nand in his Name to the Governor of those Provinces, saying that their\r\nKing and Lord, Canek, and all his Vassals, were desirous of the\r\nFriendship of the Spaniards and were coming to ask for Peace.\r\n\r\n\"As nothing was to be lost thereby the Governor believed them, and\r\nreceived their obedience which they gave. He appointed Justices from\r\namong themselves, and gave them the usual Staffs of Alcaldes; and\r\nhaving shown them all sorts of kindness he let them go, well pleased.\r\nAnd the Governor was well-satisfied, judging that now they would\r\nvoluntarily be his subjects and that they would be Christians. But\r\nlater it was seen that all this was a fantastic make-believe, poured\r\nout in the Mould of their mendacious evilness, which they frequently\r\nindulged in, as we shall see further on.\r\n\r\n\"The Governor, considering it as an insult to His Majesty and to\r\nhimself, or else being zealous or piqued by the sly treatment given by\r\nthose Barbarous Infidels, in order to convert them and knowing that he\r\ncould not make war upon them, he appealed to the Council of the Indies,\r\nasking that the Authority be granted to him to overcome and subject\r\nthem by force of arms. And he pointed out the continuousness of their\r\nwickedness, the perfidy of their idolatry, the wariness of their\r\ntricks, the terror and fear in which they held those Provinces, and\r\nwhat was necessary in order to punish and subject them by force.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mock Embassy Considered to be a Rebellion. \"Especially, since they\r\nhad now given their obedience (though pretendingly) and since they had\r\ndeparted from it, the prohibition to make War on them was at an end.\r\nFor, if His Majesty had indeed so prohibited War, these Indians were\r\nnow Vassals of the King, and failure in vassalage was a species of\r\nRebellion and Uprising. And if they had given their obedience\r\nfeigningly and craftily or with any improper end, it was a piece of\r\nrudeness worthy of not being left without very severe chastisement.[5.2]\r\n\r\n\"It does not appear whether this Governor divined what was to occur in\r\nthe future from the obstinacy, cruelty, and malevolence of these\r\nBarbarians, and how many efficacious Means were to be insufficient to\r\nreduce them to Peace; but that of War (is the best). But he pressed for\r\npermission to make use of it in order to bring them to subjection.\"\r\n\r\nHere it may be well to compare Cogolludo's account of these same events\r\nwith that of Villagutierre. Cogolludo (lib. ix, cap. 1) says that these\r\nevents took place in the reign of Bishop Don Fray Gonzalo de Salazar.\r\nIn 1609 a great plague did much harm in Yucatan. In 1610, at the end of\r\nAugust, Salazar arrived to take the post of Bishop of Yucatan. At about\r\nthat time two Indians called Alonzo Chable and Francisco Canul gave out\r\nthat they were respectively the Pope and the Bishop, and they made the\r\nwretched Catholic Indians venerate them as such. All the most sacred\r\nmysteries of the Church were profaned by them, even the Host itself.\r\nThis deplorable state of affairs was brought to an end by the\r\nintervention of the Governor of the village of Tikax in the sierra. He\r\nwas one Don Pedro Xiu, a descendant of Tutul Xiu, Lord of Mani. Owing,\r\nperhaps, to the influence of a convent in his region, this chief was a\r\ngood Christian, and he severely punished the offenders for their\r\nsacrilege. He even forced the Spaniards to attend Mass. In short his\r\nvirtue was such as to earn him the hatred of all malcontents. Finally,\r\nbeing pursued by his enemies, the cacique sought refuge in the convent\r\nof Tikax, the guardian of which was the Reverend Padre Fray Juan de\r\nCoronel.[5.3] Xiu was hidden behind the sacristy altar while the search\r\nwas going forward. In due time the more orderly portion of the Spanish\r\npopulation came to the aid of the cacique, and his enemies were put to\r\ndeath by order of the Governor of Yucatan, who at this time was the\r\nMariscal Don Carlos de Luna y Arellano. His qualities as a governor\r\nreceive the following terse tribute from Cogolludo: \"His term of\r\noffice completed, he came forth from his post in debt, whereas others,\r\nin a short while, pay great debts and come forth very rich.\" Luna had\r\nbeen rich when he went into office.\r\n\r\n\r\nA New Period in the History of the Itzas. We have now reached a sort\r\nof natural break in our history. Beginning with a review of the\r\npre-conquest history of the Mayas and of the Itzas, we have studied the\r\nentradas of Cortes, of Montejo, and of Davila into the regions formerly\r\noccupied by them. We have seen the manner in which the northern\r\nportions of Yucatan and of the Maya-Itza stock were made subject to the\r\ncrown of Castile; we have just examined the best two accounts of the\r\nevents leading up to the conquest of the southern tribes, and\r\nespecially of the Itzas of Tayasal. From the year 1614, which we have\r\nnow reached, the main interest centers about the small nation whose\r\nchief town was at Tayasal on Lake Peten. They and their subject tribes\r\nresisted the Spanish onslaughts from 1614 to 1697. It took eighty-three\r\nyears for the Spaniards to subject this nation, which cannot have\r\nnumbered more than one hundred and fifty thousand souls. The Itzas\r\nresisted successfully for a much longer time a power more their\r\nsuperior than was that of Caesar to that of the Gauls.\r\n\r\nHaving noticed the beginning of a new period, we will continue the\r\ntranslation of Villagutierre. We shall thus see how the conquest of the\r\nItzas began as a more or less desultory evangelical affair, and how no\r\nreal vigor was injected into it until a commercial motive (the building\r\nof the Yucatan-Guatemala road) was introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuensalida and Orbita. The account continues thus:\r\n\r\n\"Three or four years later, when the year 1618 was already running its\r\ncourse, on the 25th of March, while Francisco Ramirez Briceno was\r\ngoverning these Provinces, the Provincial Chapter of the Religious\r\nOrder of San Francisco was held in the City of Merida; before it, ...\r\nPadres Fray Bartolome de Fuensalida and Fray Juan de Orbita offered to\r\ngo and preach the Holy Evangel to the Itzaex; both of these were\r\nLearned Men and of consummate Virtue, they were Priests well versed in\r\nthat Maya Tongue which was natural to those Itzaex as to the Yucatecs,\r\nwhere they had been before.\r\n\r\n\"... It was determined that they should set forth on that Holy Errand;\r\nand they, well pleased, and trusting in God, determined to depart\r\nwithout delay and without other arms than the loving force of the\r\nDivine Word, thus fulfilling the will of the King that only Religious\r\nshould go, and without the clangor of Soldiery. The Provincial gave\r\nthem their patents which were presented before the Bishop, Don Gonzalo\r\nde Salazar, who was so overjoyed at their holy resolution that had his\r\npresence not been needed for the Government of his Bishopric, he would\r\nhave gone with the Padres.\r\n\r\n\"Since this could not be, the Bishop despatched to them with great\r\npleasure very ample Authority, in which he gave them as much Power over\r\nthe Spaniards as they would have had if he had been present with them;\r\nand especially in regard to the People of the Town of Salamanca de\r\nBacalar and its territory, commanding the Beneficiado of that Town and\r\nDistrict, which includes Tipu, under penalty of the greater\r\nExcommunication, in no manner direct or indirect to embarrass or to\r\nexpel the Religious while they were in Tipu, from which point they were\r\nto make ready for their Entrada to the Itzaex.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBriceno's Opposition. \"And the Bishop perceived that the Religious were\r\ngoing without attention to temporal matters, for the Governor Francisco\r\nRamirez Briceno, in spite of His Majesty's command that in such Cases\r\nthe Necessary Funds for the Divine Worship and the Viaticum for the\r\nReligious should be given from the Royal Chest, did not wish to give\r\nanything to these men; nor did he wish to give them even the Despatch\r\nfor which they asked in order that the Villages through which they\r\npassed might give them assistance, his excuse being that he did not\r\nhave orders from the King, and that if they were killed by the\r\nBarbarians or by some Native Indians they had with them, or if any\r\nother misfortune should come to pass, the Blame would be upon him. The\r\nBishop gave them, beside the Appointment, orders and aids which I have\r\nspoken of, many Crosses, Knives, Shears and other trifles and Charms\r\nfrom Spain so that they might treat the Indians well; and he comforted\r\nthem, and put new life into their zeal for this good purpose.\r\n\r\n\"The Citizens of Merida joined the Bishop in his joy and also in giving\r\nthe Padres increased Alms; and the Former Governor Don Antonio de\r\nFigueroa gave them Rosaries, and Glass Beads, and the Citizens gave\r\nthem these and many other things, and still others were bought with the\r\nAlms contributed by the _Encomenderos_. Even the Indians of the City\r\nand the Villages through which they later passed, the Chiefs, and\r\nIndian Women, gave them Clothing of the sort they were wont to use for\r\nthe improvement [of the Itzas], in order that they might be given to\r\nthe King Canek and to his Wife and to the other Chiefs of the Itzas.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Padres Set out. \"The present Governor alone, Briceno, gave them\r\nnothing, and he even swindled them out of the Despatch of Favor and\r\nAssistance, saying that he would give it to them the day of their\r\ndeparture; then he said that they should wait for it at the Convent of\r\nTikax, which is the last one in the Sierra. So that without the\r\nDespatch, but with the Blessing of God and that of the Bishop and their\r\nown Prelate, and asking all to recommend to God the good outcome of the\r\nVoyage, they set out from Merida for Bacalar, rejoicing, and on naked\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\"In a short space of time they arrived at the Convent of Tikax, for\r\nthey feared that the rains would begin. When they had waited some days\r\nfor the Despatches of the Governor, they received only a letter from\r\nhim in which he said that he did not intend to give them the Despatches\r\nfor the reasons he had already given them. The Padres greatly regretted\r\nthe coldness on the part of the Governor merely because they feared\r\nthat they would not have in Bacalar good Aid without the orders of the\r\nGovernor; for it was necessary to take Boats from there to go up the\r\nRivers from that Town to the Village of Tipu, where they were to make\r\ntheir Headquarters, according to the instructions of the Bishop.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir Route. \"But nevertheless, and confiding only in God, they\r\ncontinued their journey accompanied by some Indian Singers and\r\nSacristans who were at the Convent and whom God moved to offer\r\nthemselves as companions, although they knew the perils of the journey,\r\nand thus they went alone, without human defense, to place themselves in\r\nthe hands of those Barbarous Caribes,[5.4] of whom it was known for\r\ncertain that they ate human Flesh; but they placed all fear behind\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"And the Padres, seeing that they had with them those who would aid\r\nthem to celebrate the Divine Services solemnly, traveled very\r\ncontentedly. They arrived at Calotmul, five leagues from the Convent.\r\nAnd on leaving this Village, they traversed the Sierra to the Village\r\nof Chunhuhub, which is another fifteen leagues of deserted country full\r\nof swamps and marshes very difficult to cross. From there they\r\njourneyed to Pacha, another fifteen leagues of deserted country, with\r\nroads even worse than those before on account of their very swampy\r\nnature, which is so great that in the rainy season it is necessary to\r\ntake to Canoes in order to pass those Places, and in the dry season the\r\nCanoes are beached there.\r\n\r\n\"From the Village of Pacha they went to another called Xoca, almost\r\nanother ten leagues. This place was later deserted and overgrown with\r\ntrees. From Xoca they went to the Town of Salamanca de Bacalar, which\r\nis five leagues. And there they were regaled and favored by the\r\nAlcalde, who, at that time, was Andres Carrillo de Pernia, a Citizen of\r\nthe Town of Valladolid de Yucatan, who showed so much hospitality and\r\nkindliness while they were there to them and to the Indians whom they\r\nhad with them, that in nowise were they made to feel the want of\r\nDespatches from the Governor of Yucatan; for he gave them more favors\r\nand assistance then and later, this Alcalde, than if they had carried\r\nthe Commands, orders and Despatches of all the Tribunals of the World.\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding the great favors which the Alcalde Carrillo showed to\r\nthe Missionaries, they desired to set forth with all speed for Tipu so\r\nas not to be overtaken by the Rains; and as they found themselves, like\r\ntrue Sons of Saint Francis, without any money with which to pay the\r\nIndian Rowers who were to conduct them, and with which to buy the\r\nship-stores necessary for all in order to navigate the Rio Nohukun,\r\nwhich means Rio Grande, in order to go up by the river to Tipu, and not\r\nbeing able to ask aid of the Alcalde because of the absence of orders\r\nfrom the Governor, they were saddened and became exceedingly\r\ndisconsolate.\r\n\r\n\"But the Noble Zeal of that Honorable Creole, Alcalde Carrillo, once\r\nmore aided them. Learning the cause of their sadness, because the Holy\r\nEagerness which they had was not cooled, he provided a _Piragua_ of his\r\nown, very capacious, with Indian rowers and Supplies necessary for all.\r\nAnd not content with having fitted them out, he embarked with them and\r\naccompanied them in person as far as Tipu so that the Indians should\r\nnot leave them, and so that aid should be offered more promptly; and\r\nall this was done at the expense of his estate without being\r\nnecessitated by orders from any Superior.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Journey up the River from Tipu. \"They made the Navigation of that\r\ngreat River and of others which flow into it, with great contentment on\r\naccount of the deliciousness of its Banks, Isles, great and wide-spread\r\nLagoons, Woodlands, Forests, and Pine Groves which spread away as far\r\nas New Spain. And what caused them no less diversion was the Indians of\r\nthe _Piragua_, who, without stopping the boat, continually captured\r\nFishes with Harpoons; the only thing that annoyed them was the\r\nmultitude of Mosquitoes which there are thereabouts and which caused\r\nthem much pain and disquiet.\r\n\r\n\"To refer in detail to the Events and Places through which they passed\r\neither by Water or by Land, would be too much of prolixity, and it is\r\nnot intended to do more than to let it be known from what will be said\r\nlater, that from the City of Merida to the District and Village of Tipu\r\nit is a very long, and at times, toilsome Journey. And so it is\r\nsufficient to say that in three days, (after many of Traveling), they\r\nmounted the ascent to Tipu by the River which comes from there and\r\nwhich is very full. And as the going is against the current, which is\r\nof so much violence, in those twelve leagues that to go up to Tipu the\r\nOars are not sufficient and it is necessary to go up by means of Poles;\r\nand at every mischance the Water whirls the Canoes backward; and at\r\ntimes the Indians throw themselves upon them with arms outstretched to\r\nstop them and to draw them forward....\"\r\n\r\nThe account of these events given by Cogolludo (lib. ix, caps. 4, 5, 6)\r\nis almost identical. The place names mentioned by Villagutierre are all\r\nto be found on Costello's map (MacNutt, 1908, vol. ii, p. 232) save\r\nPacha (between Chunhuhub and Xoca). The distances from place to place\r\nare inaccurately given by Villagutierre, being invariably too short.\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival at Tipu. We will now continue by translating Villagutierre.\r\n(Lib. ii, cap. 2 ff.)\r\n\r\n\"The Alcaldes, Caziques and Chief Men of Tipu learned before their\r\narrival that the Padres were coming to their Village, and they set\r\nforth with their Canoes to go more than two leagues down the River to\r\nreceive them with Refreshments in Food and a Drink called _Zaca_, which\r\nthey make of Cacao and Maize. They saluted the Padres with much\r\ncontentment and joy, and they returned with them to the Landing place,\r\na stone's throw from the Village, and there they had prepared Dances\r\naccording to their usage, and to the accompaniment of these and much\r\nrejoicing, they took the Padres to the Church, where they offered up to\r\nGod their thanks for having permitted them to arrive safely at that\r\nVillage on the outskirts of Christendom and the Plaza de Armas of\r\nvaliant Spirits.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents at the Village of Tipu. \"And when they had said their Orisons,\r\nthe Indians quartered the Padres in the house of the _Beneficiado_ next\r\nto the Church and the Alcalde Carrillo was placed in the house of a\r\nleading Indian woman, called Dona Isabel Pec, who was the Widow of the\r\nCacique Don Luis Mazun, who had died while a prisoner for Idolatry in\r\nMerida. When the Religious reached this Village there were Vespers of\r\nthe Feast of the Holy Ghost....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Friendliness of Carrillo and the Indians. \"The Alcalde Carrillo\r\ninspected the Village as it was of his jurisdiction, and not having\r\nanything further to do there because the Citizens aided the Padres even\r\nmore than was necessary, he wished them well and took leave of them\r\nall, returning to Salamanca de Bacalar.\r\n\r\n\"The Padres now remained alone with the Indians of Tipu, but they were\r\nvery much the companions of God and of His fervent Spirit and of the\r\ngladness which it caused them to see those Indians so occupied with the\r\naffairs of good Christians such as attending with much punctuality the\r\nDivine Services, sending their Children to all the classes for the\r\nCatechism. (What passed in their hearts God alone knows, as will be\r\ntold later.) The Padres saw that the Indians aided them with much\r\ngenerosity as time went on and until they set forth for the Itzaex,\r\nbecause the people of Tipu were very rich and got much Cacao, Vanilla\r\nand other things of a noble sort.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Christoval Na, Cacique of the Indians of Tipu. \"There were then in\r\nthe Vicinity of the Village of Tipu more than one hundred\r\nCitizens,[5.5] all Indians. Don Christobal Na, their Cacique, was very\r\ndevoted to the Religious. There was another Chief Indian called Don\r\nFrancisco Cumux, who was a Descendant of the Lord of the Island of\r\nCozumel, who received Don Fernando Cortes when he passed to the\r\nConquest of New Spain. This man in his Habits, and actions showed very\r\nwell his Nobility and good Blood, although he was but an Indian. He was\r\nvery much the Servitor of the Padres and a great Singer, and he was\r\noften present in the Church, singing the Offices, as if he were a\r\ncommon Indian.\"\r\n\r\nIt was decided to send Cumux to the Itzas to ascertain their attitude\r\ntoward the Padres. \"... Cumux accepted the Embassy with a very good\r\nwill, although he was not eager for the danger; and when all had been\r\nmade ready he set forth with the Indians that were assigned to him. The\r\ncontents of the message were: To say to the Canek how the two Padres\r\nhad remained in Tipu and that the reason they had gone thither was to\r\npass to [the Itzas] to see and communicate certain things which were\r\nfor the good of Canek and his people; and so the Ambassador was to ask\r\nhim to assemble his Captains in order that they might see that their\r\ncoming was a peaceful one, without Soldiers or arms, only two Poor\r\nPadres of San Francisco; and Canek was urged to send his Chief Men to\r\nsee them at Tipu, and they said that they would like, with his leave\r\nand permission and safe-conduct to pass to see him, and that if he gave\r\nit, as they hoped, it would give them great pleasure, for without his\r\nconsent they would do nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrancisco Cumux Goes with an Embassy to Canek. \"Don Francisco Cumux set\r\nforth on his Journey, very well-pleased; he traversed those Mountains\r\nand deserts, leaving the Padres in the hands of God and making\r\ncontinual Sacrifices and Orisons. He was six days in arriving at the\r\nIsland, Capital of the Itzas; and when he was brought into the presence\r\nof Canek, he was received with affability, and he gave his message as\r\nhe had been ordered. The Itzaex entertained him and those whom he\r\nbrought with him according to the quality of each one. Then Canek\r\ncalled to Council all his Captains and Chiefs in order to consider what\r\nhe should reply to the message and Letter which the Religious had sent\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"And as some of those Indians already knew a little of what the\r\nReligious were, through having seen them in the City of Merida, at the\r\ntime when they went there to give that false obedience of which I have\r\nspoken, and they also knew that they could do them no harm if they were\r\nalone as Don Francisco Cumux asserted, they resolved not only to give\r\nLicense to come and see them, but also the Canek sent two Captains of\r\nhis, together with some Indians, in company with Don Francisco and his\r\nIndians, in order that they might visit the Padres in his behalf and\r\ntell them that they might come with all safety to his Land whenever it\r\nmight please them, for he and his men were ready to receive them and\r\ntalk with them in good feeling. And with this good Reply, farewells\r\nwere said by Don Francisco Cumux, who set forth at once very happily,\r\nreturning with the rest to Tipu.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCumux Returns from Canek with Two Chiefs of Tayasal. \"He arrived in the\r\npresence of the Religious fifteen days after he had set out from there,\r\ngreater speed being impossible because the road was closed up and\r\nsurrounded with marshes. In his company came the two Itza Captains, one\r\nwas called Ahchatappol, and the other Ahauppuc, with more than twenty\r\nother Indians. The two Captains bore their Lances with points of Flint,\r\nlike ours, which differ from them only in being of Steel, and at the\r\nheads of them are many Plumes of divers and beautiful colors like the\r\nRibbons our Standard-bearers use on their darts; and the points are as\r\nmuch as a quarter of a vara long and have two cutting-edges, and the\r\npoint is like a very sharp Dagger.\r\n\r\n\"The other Itzaex Indians bore their Bows and Arrows with which they\r\nalways march when they come forth from their Island and Territory in\r\ncase they meet the Chinamitas, a Nation for whom they have always had\r\nenmity, and continual wars; for they hold themselves as brave warriors\r\nlike the Itzas themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Two Chiefs are cordially Received. \"As soon as they arrived, the\r\ntwo Captains saluted the Religious according to their usage (which is\r\nto throw the right arm over the shoulder as a sign of Peace and\r\nFriendship). The Religious replied with many urbanities and courtesies.\r\nThe Captains were quartered in the house of the Cacique and the rest in\r\nthe houses of the Chiefs of that Village of Tipu, care being taken to\r\nregale them as had been done in their Island to our Indians.\r\n\r\n\"And later Don Francisco Cumux gave the Religious an account of how he\r\nhad been received by Canek and by the other Chiefs and Heads of the\r\nDistricts of the City, and of how they had shown joy and of what had\r\ngone forward, and of the opinion that they had that the Padres should\r\ngo to see the Itzas. The Padres were full of joy, and they thanked Don\r\nFrancisco and his companions for the trouble they had had on that\r\nJourney, and they told them that it was certain that God would reward\r\nthem, for they had gone in His service and in His Holy Name....\"\r\n\r\nA rather verbose account of the services held for the benefit of the\r\nItzas closes this chapter. The account of Cogolludo (lib. ix, caps. 7,\r\n8) is much the same. Villagutierre (lib. ii, cap. 3) continues his\r\ndescription of the entrada of Fuensalida and Orbita:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Padres Prepare to Travel to Tayasal. \"The Religious tried, after\r\nthe Itzaex Indians had gone thence, with their Indians of Tipu, to make\r\nready for the Journey and to prepare the necessary food for traveling.\r\nThis was done in a short while; so that on the Day of the Assumption of\r\nOur Lady, 15 August, 1618, they set forth from Tipu in company with the\r\nCacique of that Village, Don Christoval Na, and with more than twenty\r\nimportant Indians besides those others which were needed as servants,\r\ntheir _Maestro de Capilla_, their Singers and their Sacristans, all of\r\nwhom had offered to go with them from the Province....\r\n\r\n\"Two leagues from Tipu, in the direction of the Itzas, there was a\r\nGreat River which, because the Waters had not risen greatly, it was\r\npossible to wade; and the Cacique, Don Christoval Na, who was a very\r\ncorpulent man of great personal strength, placed the two Religious on\r\nhis shoulders [and carried them across]. The River having been crossed,\r\nthey journeyed some eight or ten leagues, and came upon a Great Lake\r\nwhich they called Yaxhaa. And finding no Canoe with which to traverse\r\nthe Lake's two leagues of length, the Indians told the Religious that\r\nthey should return to the Village of Tipu, since they could not go\r\nforward on account of the necessity of crossing the Lake, and because\r\nof the lack of Vessels.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDelays; the Padres' Anger. \"The Padre Commissario Fuensalida became\r\nexceedingly angry with them, saying that it was not possible that they\r\nshould have been ignorant of that Impediment, since they were so well\r\nversed in that Land and Road, and that they should have remedied it;\r\nand he declared that he would not go back upon the Road so well begun\r\nand that he would continue upon his Journey until he reached the\r\nItzaex, for which place he and his Companion had set forth. And so, as\r\nto think of floating on any makeshift was to think of the impossible,\r\nand as to the left of that Lake it appeared that one might break\r\nthrough the Forest and proceed by opening a Road [through the jungle],\r\npassing around the edge of the Lake, they decided that they might thus\r\ncontinue their Voyage in a straight line.\r\n\r\n\"The Indians made this seem to be very difficult and they replied that\r\nit was far, and that it would be too toilsome to open a Road through\r\nthe places the Father mentioned, and that the Supplies that they had\r\nwith them were not sufficient for so many days, and they would want for\r\nthem later on. Besides the time was coming on when it would be\r\nnecessary for them to take in their crops from the fields and they said\r\nthat while they were doing that a Canoe should be built on purpose for\r\nthem all to cross the Lake and that they would carry the Padres with\r\nmuch pleasure and little toil to the Itzaex.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Return to Tipu. \"Padre Fuensalida insisted and persisted that what\r\nhe had first proposed should be executed, namely, to cut around the\r\nLake. And the Indians asked Padre Juan de Orbita to dissuade the Padre\r\nCommissario since what they said was more fitting. It seemed, at last,\r\nindeed to be so, and that the Indians were right, and all agreed to\r\nreturn to Tipu, and to build there a Canoe in which to pass across the\r\nLake as they offered to do.\r\n\r\n\"When they had returned to Tipu, the Cacique Don Christoval soon sent\r\nIndian, carpenters who, on the very shore of the Lake, were to make\r\nready the wood for a very good Canoe. There are in that region great\r\nlogs of Cedar and other trees from which can be made and are made many\r\nlarge Canoes. They built it very capacious and suitable; and the other\r\nIndians, in the interim, gathered in their crops and assembled new\r\nprovisions in order to set out once more with the Padres for the Land\r\nof the Itzaex.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Precautions Taken, they Set out Once More. \"Once more they all set\r\nout as before from Tipu. They crossed the Rio Grande, which is two\r\nleagues away, with much more trouble than before because the Waters had\r\nrisen and were still rising, as it was already near the end of\r\nSeptember. And having arrived once more at the Lake of Yaxhaa, where\r\nthe Canoe was in readiness, the Persons who were journeying and all\r\nthat they had with them were carried across the two leagues of water in\r\nfour trips.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLake Yaxha is Crossed; Arrival at Lake Zacpeten. \"Everything and\r\neverybody being now on the other bank, they continued their march by\r\nLand for some fifteen leagues as far as another Lake, which was called\r\nZacpeten (which is the same as saying White Island), which was shorter\r\nthan the other, being not more than a league in length....\"\r\n\r\nHere follows a short passage describing how the devil made the Indians\r\nchoose the wrong path. The reason for this suggested by Villagutierre\r\nseems plausible, namely, that the Tipuans did not want the Itzas\r\nconverted, because if they were the Tipuans would have no place to take\r\nrefuge should they themselves become apostates.\r\n\r\n\"When the Tipuan Indians saw the Constancy of the Padres (for, although\r\nthey knew the malice of the Indians, they bore it with patience, and\r\nencouraged them, saying that God would bring them out on the right Road\r\nsince He had brought them there) and perceiving that the intention of\r\nthe Padres not to turn back was unchanged, or else, because they saw\r\nthat the Spirit of the Padres became more determined the greater the\r\ndifficulties they experienced on the way, the Indians at length brought\r\nthem out upon the right road. And after they had followed it for two\r\ndays and eighteen leagues, they came upon the Great Lake of the Itzaex\r\ncalled Chaltuna, with great relief and joy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Padres Camp beside Lake Peten. \"They encamped on the Shore of the\r\nLake and there built a very capacious Ranch in which they set up an\r\naltar in order to say Mass. Then they sent off a very important Indian\r\nof Tipu (who later was Cacique) with some others who were in his\r\ncompany, with orders to say to the Canek that the Religious were there,\r\nand to hand over to him a present of the trifles that had been given\r\nthem in Merida for this purpose and also a little _Cacao_ from Tipu,\r\nwhich was very fine (and is so even today), and a very good _hanger_\r\n(cutlass). They warned the messenger also to tell the Canek to send\r\nthem good Canoes for them to cross to his Island, and some of his Chief\r\nmen who should take them thither.\r\n\r\n\"The Important Indian, Don Gaspar Cetza (for so he was named), set\r\nforth for the Island with the others who were going with him. And when\r\neight days had been spent in waiting (which caused the Padres anxiety)\r\nDon Gaspar returned, accompanied by the Captains Ahchatappol and\r\nAhauppuc, who had been in the Village of Tipu, and by other Itzaex\r\nIndians, as well as by four large Canoes which Canek sent in order that\r\nall might cross over in one trip.\r\n\r\n\"With this good provision they embarked, all feeling very contented and\r\nhappy, on that same day after having said Mass and eaten. And with the\r\nItza Captains and the other Indians, they navigated, in good time, the\r\nlength of that Lake to the Island which, from that direction, is some\r\nsix leagues. The Itzaex, who were in sight in order to see when they\r\nwere approaching the Island, and others who in Canoes came out to a\r\ngreat distance for the same purpose, gave notice to the Canek of how\r\nthe Religious were already arriving and were approaching. And the Canek\r\nsent a son-in-law of his with others of his Family, in two Canoes, who\r\ncame out more than two leagues to salute the Padres and receive them in\r\nhis name.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Padres Arrive at Tayasal and are well Received. \"They brought them\r\nsome of that Drink which is called _Zaca_, together with frothed\r\n_cacao_, which is highly esteemed among them (and, in short, though\r\nthey were Barbarians, they did not fail to have their own sort of\r\npoliteness in some matters and signs of urbanity and good manners).\r\nThey arrived at the Landing place very near the Village, and there was\r\nthe Petty King or Cacique Canek with his Chiefs and a great crowd who\r\nhad come out to receive them. And it was already about ten at night\r\nwhen they arrived at the Island, but there were many lighted torches of\r\n_Ocote_ or Candlewood: so that all was clear and visible.\r\n\r\n\"When the Religious had set foot on Land, Canek received them with\r\ndemonstrations of great love and good will, and with much content. He\r\ninvited the Religious to a House which he had made for them, although\r\nit was not very large, near his Palace, or rather, large House where he\r\nresided, and which was some twenty paces from that of the Padres, which\r\nwas ample for their necessities. Two very good _Barbacoas_ (=?) were\r\nset up, according to their usage as Beds, and all those who were with\r\nthe Padres were quartered nearby.\r\n\r\n\"The House of Canek was some forty paces from the Lake and before it\r\nwas a small Square in which was the House which he had had built for\r\nthe Religious and with which they were much pleased, seeing how near it\r\nwas to his own and how easy it would be to communicate with him\r\nfrequently. Besides, the site was a very good one. And on the day after\r\ntheir arrival they embellished a Room in their House and erected there\r\nan Altar so that they might say Mass; and Padre Fuensalida chanted that\r\nof Saint Paul the Apostle, to whom they gave the Patronage of that\r\nIsland.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMass is Said. \"Very many of the Itzaex were looking on from outside\r\nwith profound silence and without making a single sound that could\r\ndisturb what the Religious were doing. They, after having said Mass,\r\nwent to see Canek, and after having saluted him, they remained in\r\nconversation with him a great while, for they knew the Language very\r\nwell. They asked his leave to go all through the Village and to see its\r\nHouses and all its _Cues_ or Temples, which were numerous. Canek\r\nconceded it, and gave them important Indians who were to go with them\r\nthrough the Village and show them all that they wished to see. The\r\nprincipal purpose of the Padres in soliciting this permission was to\r\nmake a beginning to their preaching; from that time on, in the presence\r\nof Canek, of the Chiefs and of a great crowd of _Zamaguales_ or Common\r\nPeople, they began to preach the Law of God....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFuensalida Preaches; Orbita Destroys an Idol. \"With great attention the\r\nIndians who were congregated there listened to the discourse of the\r\nPadre Fuensalida....\" For a brief time it looked as if the Padres might\r\nattain success in the errand, but as we saw in Chapter III, Padre\r\nOrbita, in anger, destroyed the idol of the horse and also the\r\ntolerance of the Itzas.\r\n\r\n\"Having returned to the guest house, and having rested a little from\r\nthe toil of the Spiritual Battle and of breaking the Idol, the\r\nReligious went to see Canek, who, although he already knew what had\r\nhappened in the Temple, and though they themselves spoke of it to him,\r\ndid not say a word about it, nor did he show anger on account of it. So\r\nthat the other Indians, seeing their Lord calm, became entirely\r\nappeased, and spoke no more of the affair to the Padres. But it is true\r\nthat the Canek did not leave off wondering that they should have dared\r\nto do such a thing as that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Padres Urge the Itzas to be Christians. \"He made them sit down on\r\nsomething which was like a small throne and on which he was wont to sit\r\nhimself; it was then raised and placed in the midst of them, and being\r\nthus raised, the Padres discoursed for a long time concerning the\r\naffairs of God and the Holy Catholic Faith....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThey Refuse because the Appointed Time has not Come. They told the\r\nCanek that a previous Canek had promised Cortes to receive\r\nChristianity. \"... Canek replied: That the time had not yet arrived in\r\nwhich their ancient Priests had prophesied to them they were to\r\nrelinquish the worship of their Gods; because the Period in which they\r\nthen were was Oxahau, which means Third Period[5.6] ... and so they\r\nasked the Padres to make no further attempts in that direction at that\r\ntime, but to return to the Village of Tipu and then, on another\r\noccasion, to come again to see them.\r\n\r\n\"Despite all this, Canek was the first to receive, with great pleasure,\r\na Cross which the Padres placed in his hands, and afterwards some of\r\nhis men received others. Canek gave the Padres permission, during the\r\ndays they were his guests, to chant the Christian Doctrine; they did so\r\nin the seventh Tone as they were accustomed to chant it in the Province\r\nof Yucatan.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a Few Days the Padres Leave Tayasal. \"In this way several days\r\npassed, and the Religious, perceiving that they could in no wise\r\nproceed with the execution of their good desire, on account of the fact\r\nthat the Indians would not change their minds, determined to return to\r\nthe Village of Tipu in order to obtain the benefit of the good-will of\r\nthe people there with their suavity and patience.\r\n\r\n\"They imparted this determination to the Infidels, who readily agreed\r\nto it. The Indians who had come with them made ready a Canoe; and the\r\nItzas gave the Religious some figures of their Idols, which they took\r\nto Yucatan that they might be seen, and some Clothing of the sort the\r\nIndians use.\"\r\n\r\nThe Padres left Tayasal under rather unpleasant circumstances; some of\r\nthe Indians seem to have harbored a grudge against them because of the\r\nincident of the idol, and these malcontents hurled insults after the\r\ncanoes in which the Padres were going away. They returned to Tipu by\r\nthe same way they had come, arriving there at the beginning of\r\nNovember. The _Beneficiado_ of Bacalar would not let them stay in Tipu;\r\nhe was reprimanded by the Bishop for his surliness. Finally Padre\r\nFuensalida returned to Merida, leaving Orbita In charge of the Indians\r\nat Tipu.\r\n\r\nThus ended the entrada of Fuensalida and Orbita into the country of the\r\nItzas. One cannot but admire the stanch faith and unswerving loyalty to\r\ntheir ideals of these two men. They were both of great personal courage\r\nand virtue, but from the foregoing account of their entrada it is easy\r\nenough to deduce that Fuensalida was the greater man of the two. Orbita\r\nwas skillful in making effective altar displays, but he was hasty and\r\nunwise in his treatment of the idol of the horse. We must, however,\r\nfrankly acknowledge that for two men to go alone and unarmed into the\r\nmidst of a powerful nation of barbarians whom they believed to be\r\ncannibals was a deed of very great bravery, especially as they had no\r\nexpectations of personal material gain. This entrada of 1618 is just\r\nbarely mentioned by Fray Andres de Avendano y Loyola (30 recto), who,\r\nhowever, speaks of the idol incident as a mistake of policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n              THE ENTRADA OF PADRE FRAY DIEGO DELGADO AND\r\n                  THE EVENTS THAT FOLLOWED, 1621-1624\r\n\r\n\r\nPadre Fray Diego Delgado's Offer to Christianize the Itzas. In spite of\r\nthe unfortunate turn that events had taken while Fuensalida and Orbita\r\nwere at Tayasal, another Franciscan, Fray Diego Delgado, was filled\r\nwith a desire to Christianize the Itzas. He set out from Merida;\r\nVillagutierre (lib. ii, cap. 8) relates the story thus:\r\n\r\n\"... A year and a half, with a slight difference, after the return of\r\nthe Padres Orbita and Fuensalida, repulsed by the Itzaex, at a time\r\nwhen already the year 1621 was running its course and the Provincial\r\nChapter of the Order of Saint Francis had already been held in the City\r\nof Merida, a proposal was made by the Padre Fray Diego Delgado, of the\r\nsame Order and a Son of the Province of Los Angeles, to the new\r\nProvincial of Yucatan, the proposal being dictated by the desires of\r\nhis Spiritual Love.\"\r\n\r\nThere follows a setting forth of Delgado's belief that the fugitive\r\nIndians were likely to relapse into idolatry. Delgado asked leave to go\r\nand reconvert them; this was given by Arias Conde, Governor _ad\r\ninterim_ of Yucatan.\r\n\r\n\r\nDelgado Travels to the Convent of Xecchacan. \"Everything having been\r\nmade ready for his journey, the Monk journeyed to that Convent of his\r\nOrder which is in the Village of Xecchacan. And when his intention was\r\nknown there, several Indians of the Village offered to go with him, for\r\nthose of that place are well-versed in the Woodlands. And also certain\r\nother Indians who were Singers and Sacristans of the Convent, as is\r\ncustomary ..., also promised to go with him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe is well Provided with Guides and Other Indians. \"So that now Fray\r\nDiego Delgado found himself not only with Guides, but with those who\r\nwould aid him in celebrating the Divine Services and the Holy Sacrifice\r\nof the Mass. And also some of the Indians of the Sierra came to him\r\nwith a great inclination and desire to accompany him on that Voyage.\r\nAnd together with These and Those, he entered into the Woodlands to the\r\nSouthward of that Land of Yucatan.\r\n\r\n\"And as soon as he began to penetrate the Woods, he kept encountering\r\nmany of the Indians who were fugitives from the Villages of the\r\nProvince, and who were living without Decency, Towns or Sacraments, but\r\nmerely in Huts in several places of that Wilderness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nZaclun. \"He went about, bringing them with flattering caresses and the\r\ngreat suavity of his holy and loving words, and bearing them to the\r\nMountains which are called the Mountains of Pimienta (which are very\r\nnear the Sierra of Alabaster).... He formed with them a great Village\r\non the same site as where had been before the village called Zaclun,\r\nwhich had been depopulated when the Guardians of the Province of San\r\nFrancisco, who had gone, in former times, toward those inland Mountain\r\nPlaces, had been lost.\r\n\r\n\"He gave the Village the Name of San Felipe or Santiago de Zaclun. And\r\nin virtue of the Power given him by the Governor of Yucatan, to appoint\r\nJustices and Rulers in whatever Villages might be founded, he did this\r\nin the new Village of Zaclun in the Name of his Majesty and of his\r\nGovernor of the Provinces of Yucatan, giving the posts to the most fit\r\nof those very Indians he had recently assembled.\r\n\r\n\"He appointed a Cacique and gave Authority to Alcaldes, Regidores, and\r\nother Officials of Government and of Public Weal, all of whom he\r\nappointed in order that those Indians might live in Justice,\r\nChristianity, and service to God and the King. And when this was done\r\nhe gave an account of the whole matter to the Governor of Yucatan,\r\nbegging him to confirm the Elections and Appointments that he had made\r\nfor that new Village.\r\n\r\n\"The Governor of those Provinces of Yucatan at the time was Don Diego\r\nde Cardenas, who celebrated with very great merriment the reception of\r\nsuch news, a delight which was participated in by all the Dwellers in\r\nthe City of Merida and even in the rest of that Land and Province of\r\nYucatan.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Francisco de Mirones, who was Juez de la Grana [agrarian\r\nofficer] of the Territory of the Coast of Yucatan, and a very great\r\nSoldier, and the gallantry of whose Spirit was delighted at this new\r\nturn of affairs, conjectured that it was a fine occasion to enter by\r\nthat Village of Zaclun to conquer by Arms the Itzaex; for the\r\nReligious, with all their preaching, had made no headway. Captain\r\nMirones was persuaded that by way of Zaclun the Conquest would be\r\neasier, on account of the convenience which the nearness of that place\r\nwould offer for whatever military operation he might wish to carry out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Proposal of Mirones. \"He went to communicate this Proposal to the\r\nGovernor, adorning the plan with arguments as to its suitableness,\r\nwhich he well knew how to do; to the Governor it appeared a very good\r\nthing that that Entrada into the Itzaex should be executed even as\r\nCaptain Mirones proposed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMirones and the Governor Make an Agreement. There follows a passage\r\nrelating to the agreement made between the Governor and Mirones. It is\r\nin no way unusual. The remissness of Brizeno at the time of the entrada\r\nof Orbita and Fuensalida is touched upon, and the usual protestations\r\nas to the desirability of converting the Indians to Christianity.\r\n\r\n\r\nMirones Raises an Army for his Entrada. \"Captain Francisco de Mirones\r\nraised his Banner for the King, and having enlisted as many as Five\r\nhundred Spanish Soldiers, he set forth with them and with some Indians\r\nof War and of Service from the City of Merida to join the rest who were\r\nbeing recruited at the Village of Oxcutzcab in the Sierra. The journey\r\nthrough that region led the Guide to tell Captain Mirones that from\r\nOxcutzcab he had surveyed the highlands of the Itzas of Yucatan, that\r\nin a direct line or through the Air it was a distance of only eighty\r\nleagues, so that more than a half of the Road had already been\r\ntraversed; having believed it all to be so, Captain Mirones ... set\r\nforth with his Troops, and many Indian laborers, from the Village of\r\nOxcutzcab, opening many Roads through the Woods and Thickets and among\r\nthe Lakes and Swamps and sterile Lands, lacking water in many places.\r\nSo that not only for the Indians who opened the roads, but also for the\r\nSpanish Soldiers, it was very painful work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMirones Arrives at Zaclun. \"But at last, these difficulties being\r\novercome, they arrived at the Village of Zaclun, where the Padre Fray\r\nDiego Delgado was established, administering to his Indians recently\r\ncollected. In the Village Captain Mirones made a halt, making a Plaza\r\nde Armas so as to wait for the rest of his Troops, who were still being\r\nlevied in Merida, in order that, on their arrival, he might begin with\r\nall his forces the Conquest of the Itzas.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wanton and Foolish Oppression Caused by Mirones. \"The Recruiting of\r\nTroops in Merida could not be concluded in the short space of time\r\nexpected by Captain Mirones, and so all the remainder of that year of\r\n1622 was spent thus in the Village of Zaclun waiting for the Levies.\r\nAnd at that time, failing in wisdom and lacking proper consideration of\r\nthe fact that those Indians of Zaclun were people newly reduced and\r\nthat it would not be fitting to treat them with the sort of oppression\r\nwith which it is sometimes customary to treat others in those parts of\r\nAmerica, that Captain gave himself up to trades and unduly profitable\r\ncontracts with them, which did not please them. So they began to be\r\nexasperated and to show some asperity of temper.\r\n\r\n\"Padre Fray Diego, recognizing the harm, and perceiving that it was not\r\na good way to maintain his hold over the Indians or to keep the Indians\r\non the right path, asked the Captain not to persist in those trades and\r\ncontracts with the Indians, for the time of Conquests was not the time\r\nfor merchandizing. He pointed out to him what he already knew, that the\r\nIndians were getting very much put out, and that grave obstacles to the\r\ncarrying on of what had been begun might arise, and that it was not\r\nwithout cause that our Kings had ordered in so many Laws and\r\nOrdinances, the good treatment of the Indians.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDelgado Opposes Mirones. \"The Padre, by these representations, was\r\nunable to procure any change in the Captain, but each day increased the\r\nlatter's profits and extortions, so that the Indians of that Village\r\nbecame increasingly restless.\r\n\r\n\"The quarrels which the Captain and the Padre came to have over these\r\nquestions were now declared in public and even talked of to a certain\r\nextent, and both were displeased with the other, and the Indians were\r\nuneasy and half mutinous. And the disquiet of these latter was\r\nincreased by the arrival at that Village of Zaclun of news that Captain\r\nJuan Bernardo de Casanova was now in the Village of Mani on his march\r\nwith fifty Soldiers who had been recruited in Merida to join in the\r\nVillage of Zaclun with Captain Mirones and those whom he had with him.\r\nAll of which gave cause to the unfortunate events which I shall now\r\ndescribe.\"\r\n\r\nVillagutierre (lib. ii, cap. 9) has an account of how Fray Diego\r\ncomplained to his Provincial of Captain Mirones and his actions. The\r\nProvincial, urging the illegality of Mirones' projected entrada to the\r\nItzas, and especially that of his intention to conquer them by arms,\r\nadvised Fray Diego to depend for advice as to the course he should\r\npursue solely upon heavenly inspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\nDelgado Determines to Anticipate Mirones. \"When Padre Fray Diego\r\nreceived this Reply, he determined (although with great secrecy) to\r\nleave Captain Mirones and to go himself to the Itzaex. And so he did,\r\nnor did he lack the company of most of the Indians who had come with\r\nhim from Xecchacan. He undertook his journey, directing his steps\r\ntoward Tipu; and although there were many trials and hardships on\r\naccount of the Woods and rough country entirely without Roads, Villages\r\nand rest from fatigue, his Indians bore him thither.\r\n\r\n\"Being suspicious, and knowing the Road that the Padre had taken,\r\nCaptain Mirones dispatched twelve Soldiers after him with their Leader,\r\nwho was the Standard-bearer Acosta, in order that they might catch up\r\nwith him and persuade him to return to the Captain's company, and, in\r\ncase the Padre did not wish so to return, they were to follow after him\r\nand escort him wherever he might go.\r\n\r\n\"The Squad came up with the Religious just before he reached Tipu. But\r\nthe more they insisted that he return to Zaclun, the more impossible\r\ndid it become to convince him and to make him return, so they\r\naccompanied him, forming an escort for him, as far as the Village of\r\nTipu, which they entered with him and with the Indians who were with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"The Chief of the Soldiers dispatched a report from Tipu to Captain\r\nMirones of the invincible resolution in which Padre Fray Diego\r\npersisted, because the Soldiers had orders not to desert the Padre.\r\nThere is but little doubt what the feelings of the Infidel Indians\r\nwould be, wherever he passed with those Soldiers, and that so long as\r\nhe was accompanied by them, the Indians would not dare to maltreat him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDelgado's Message to Canek. \"Padre Fray Diego Delgado determined to\r\nsend to the Itzaex and to their King Canek to say that he was in the\r\nVillage of Tipu, and that with their Permission, he would come to see\r\nthem. An offer to bear this Message was made by the good Cacique Don\r\nChristoval Na, who had gone with the Padres Orbita and Fuensalida to\r\nthe Itzaex both times, as has been seen. In effect, he went to\r\nChaltuna; crossed to the Island; delivered his Message. And when the\r\nItzaex and their King and Lord Canek were informed of the small number\r\nof Spaniards who were with Padre Fray Diego in Tipu, Canek and his\r\nChiefs gave Permission and Safe-conduct to the Padre so that he might\r\ncome to the Island.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDelgado Receives Permission from Canek to Come to Tayasal. \"And when\r\nthe Cacique Don Christoval had returned with this Reply, and when the\r\nprovisions had been made ready as usual and when all the other things\r\nnecessary for the Journey had been prepared [the Padre set out] taking\r\nwith him the Spaniards and eighty Indians from his Village to carry the\r\nsupplies and baggage of the Spaniards. All went by the accustomed Road.\r\nAnd so they were spied upon by the Itzaex, who were on the lookout and\r\nwho sent to the landing-place some very good Canoes so that they might\r\ncross to the Island.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Treachery of the Itzas. \"Padre Fray Diego, the Cacique of Tipu, and\r\nalt the other Spaniards and Indians embarked. On landing on the Island\r\nthe Itzaex received them in Peace and without any sign whatever of\r\ncontrary feelings. But all this was pretence and evil deceitfulness and\r\nperfidy, because as soon as they had them in their power, all the\r\nTroops of the Village attacked the unprepared Spanish Soldiers; the\r\nIndians from Tipu were unable to defend themselves: the Itzaex manacled\r\nthem all and even the Padre Fray Diego himself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDelgado and Others are Put to Death. Villagutierre tells in detail how\r\nthe soldiers must have been armed, because they would not be so foolish\r\nas to trust to the honor of natives; they were, however, but thirteen\r\nin number. All the soldiers were killed, and their hearts were torn\r\nfrom their breasts, while their heads were set up on stakes around the\r\nvillage. Later they took Fray Diego, cut him up into pieces, and set\r\nhis head on a stake also. The fate of Cacique Na, whom, no doubt, the\r\nItzas regarded as a traitor to his own race, was no better.\r\n\r\n\r\nMirones Sends Ek after Delgado. Meanwhile Mirones had received no word\r\nfrom the men he had sent as an escort to Padre Diego Delgado. He sent\r\ntwo Spaniards from Zaclun with an Indian servant of his who was very\r\ncunning and who was to act as an interpreter and guide. His name was\r\nBernardino Ek. These three were to go to Tipu and learn all that they\r\ncould of the whereabouts of the Padre and the soldiers. On their\r\narrival at that village they were told that Delgado and the rest had\r\ngone to the Itzas. The three determined to follow; they did so, and\r\ndirectly they had reached the lake, canoes came in response to a smoke\r\nsignal and bore them to the island, where they were all shut up in a\r\ncorral and kept under guard. They made an attempt to escape, Ek leading\r\nthe way. He succeeded in getting out on the lake in a very bad canoe\r\nwhich he found on the beach, but the two Spaniards found themselves\r\ngreatly hampered by their bonds and were recaptured. Ek hid in the\r\nwoods from those who were pursuing him and eventually made his way to\r\nSalamanca, where he told all that had happened. A report was sent to\r\nGovernor Don Diego de Cardenas in Merida, and Ek himself was sent to\r\nCaptain Mirones at Zaclun. The latter straightway entered a complaint\r\nagainst Fray Diego for having done anything so foolhardy as to go to\r\nthe Itzas. The upshot of the report made by Mirones' agent, Juan de\r\nEguiluz, was that the Provincial of the Order of San Francisco in\r\nYucatan sent to Zaclun one Padre Fray Juan de Berrio, a native of\r\nCastile. Villagutierre continues (lib. ii, cap. 10): \"He, having been\r\nthere [at Zaclun] a matter of fifteen days, because he did not well\r\nagree with the affairs and actions of the Captain and the Soldiers,\r\nreturned to Merida without saying anything to them, and he went to the\r\npresence of his Provincial, who, being informed of all that was going\r\non, considered his retreat to that City [Merida] a deed well done.\r\n\r\n\"A second time Captain Mirones made complaint through Contador Eguiluz,\r\nand he asked, as he did the first time, for another Friar. The\r\nProvincial refused to give him one because of what had occurred with\r\nthe other two whom he had sent before....\" As a result of these\r\nwranglings two Creole monks were finally sent to Zaclun.\r\n\r\n\r\nRevolt of the Indians. After they had been ordered to go to Zaclun,\r\nthey proffered various excuses, and the matter was ended at last by one\r\nPadre Fray Juan Enriquez, who offered to go thither himself. He was\r\nwell received by Mirones; at about that time Bernardino Ek arrived with\r\nthe news of the death of Delgado and his companions. Mirones would not\r\nbelieve him. He soon had ample cause to do so. On the Day of\r\nPurification, 1624, when all the Spaniards of Zaclun were at Mass, the\r\nIndians rose in revolt and put most of them to death.\r\n\r\nSome time later Padre Fray Juan Fernandez and Captain Juan Bernardo\r\ncame to Zaclun by way of Mani. The latter joined him at Mani, and as\r\nboth were made suspicious by some Indians leading a mule of which they\r\ncould not give a satisfactory account, Fernandez and Bernardo\r\ndetermined to go to Zaclun. When they reached that place they found the\r\nbodies of their compatriots, who had died \"by the very arms with which\r\nthey had thought to go against the Itzaex, in opposition to the orders\r\nand will of the King.\" (Villagutierre, p. 144.) A Christian burial was\r\ngiven to the dead, after which Fernandez and Bernardo returned to\r\nMerida to report on what they had found. Eventually an Indian captain\r\nnamed Don Fernando Camal captured many of the aggressors, the chief of\r\nwhom, Ahkimpol, with several others, was beheaded in Merida.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Epidemic of Apostasy; the Third Phase of the Conquest of the Itzas\r\nBegins. A direct result of this insurrection was a general epidemic of\r\napostasy which especially affected such villages as Tipu. There, a few\r\nyears later, a general exodus of the Indians into the mountains and\r\nwoods took place, and a widespread relapse into idolatry occurred.\r\n\r\nBy a cedula of March 29, 1639, the King (Philip III) reiterated his\r\ndesire that henceforth all efforts to reduce provinces should be\r\ncarried on by means of spiritual methods only. These were not enough. A\r\nseries of misfortunes and mutinies occurred at Bolonchen, Zahcabchen,\r\nPetenecte, and elsewhere. (Villagutierre, p. 147.)[6.1]\r\n\r\nWe have now, with the year 1624, reached the close of the second phase\r\nof the Spanish conquest of the Maya-Itza stock. The first phase, an\r\nexploratory one, began with Cortes in 1524 and ended with Montejo in\r\n1545 or thereabouts. The second phase, a proselytizing one, began with\r\nthe year 1614, when the feigned submission of the Itzas took place,\r\ngiving rise to the entrada of Fuensalida and Orbita. It came to a dose\r\nabout 1624 as a result of the mournful events following upon the\r\nentrada of Delgado and the mercenary meddling of Mirones. The third and\r\nlast phase, a commercial and military one, we shall consider in Chapter\r\nVIII. It had its inception about 1692.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                 THE EARLY HISTORY OF GUATEMALA AND THE\r\n                  ENTRADA FROM THAT COUNTRY, 1694-1695\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto all our attention has been absorbed by the Maya-speaking\r\npeoples of Yucatan and northern Guatemala and with the entradas made\r\nfrom Yucatan into the Peten region and to Tayasal. Now, however, we are\r\nto consider, first, the early history of the Maya-speaking peoples of\r\nsouthern Guatemala and the entradas made from that region into the\r\nnorthern parts of the country in search of Lake Peten and Tayasal.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indian Tribes of Guatemala. The two chief tribes were the highly\r\ncultured Cakchiquel and Quiche. They lived in what may be described as\r\nthe central portion of modern Guatemala. To the north of them dwelt the\r\nCholes, Lacandones, Mopanes, and Itzas; to the south, along the Pacific\r\ncoast, were the Pipiles. With the exception of the latter, all these\r\npeople spoke dialects of Maya. It is well to note, however, that both\r\nFuentes y Guzman (1882) and Stoll (1884) arrived at the conclusion that\r\nat least two thousand years must have elapsed to permit of the\r\ndevelopment of the differences that exist between the Maya of Yucatan\r\nand the Maya of the Cakchiquel and of the Quiche.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccount of the Cakchiquel and of the Quiche. The migration myths of the\r\nCakchiquel and of the Quiche show that they came originally from the\r\nregion of Mexico. Much later the Pipiles, a Nahuatl tribe, formed trade\r\ncolonies on the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Government and the Cities of the Cakchiquel and of the Quiche. The\r\nruler was chosen alternately from two families, the Zotzil and the\r\nXahil. In like manner the early Colombian chiefs of Tunja and of\r\nMuequeta alternately chose from among their relatives the chief of\r\nSuamo. The title of the ruler was Ahpo-Zotzil or Ahpo-Xahil, as the\r\ncase might be. The word _ahpo_, like the Quichua word _apu_, which it\r\nresembles, means \"Great Chief.\" There was a marked division into\r\nclasses among the Cakchiquel and the Quiche. In addition the sacerdotal\r\nbody was strongly intrenched in the social system. The Annals of the\r\nCakchiquel (Brinton, 1885) throw some light on the history of these\r\npeople. These Annals were written by a member of the Xahil family. The\r\nmythical accounts go back to the reign of King Gagavitz, who flourished\r\nabout 1380. Sometime early in the fifteenth century the Cakchiquel came\r\ninto violent contact with the Quiche, and Quikab, King of the Quiche,\r\nmade good, for a time, his rule over the Cakchiquel. Later the latter\r\nregained their freedom and founded Iximche.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpanish Conquest. What Cortes was to Mexico and Montejo was to Yucatan,\r\nPedro de Albarado or Alvarado was to Guatemala. He was sent to that\r\ncountry by Cortes, with whom he had been in Mexico. Leaving Mexico on\r\nNovember 13, 1523, he went to Guatemala with about eighty adventurous\r\nfollowers, an abundance of munitions, and some ships. He reduced the\r\nwhole region of the Cakchiquel-Quiche peoples to a Spanish province.\r\n(Cortes, apud MacNutt, 1908, vol. ii, p. 178; Fuentes y Guzman, 1882,\r\nvol. i, p. 46.) On July 25, 1524, the official title of this city\r\nbecame Santiago de los Cavalleros de Goathemala. In 1533 the King\r\nordered Alvarado, whom he had made Governor of Guatemala, to make to\r\nhim a full report concerning the country and its people and their\r\ncustoms. In 1541 Alvarado died at Guatemala, having in the meantime\r\nbeen to Peru. From that time down to about 1675 the city and Audiencia\r\nof Guatemala enjoyed a fair measure of prosperity under the usual type\r\nof Spanish rule. In 1675 some Chol Indians arrived there, asking the\r\nDominican Provincial of Guatemala, Padre Maestro Fray Francisco\r\nGallegos, for missionaries to teach them the Christian faith.\r\n(Villagutierre, p. 150 ff.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGallegos and Delgado. As a result of this Gallegos himself and Padre\r\nFray Joseph Delgado set off from Guatemala and traveled twenty-three\r\nleagues through very rough country. At length they came upon some\r\nCholes, whom they formed into three small villages called San Lucas,\r\nNuestra Senora del Rosario, and Santiago. They later made these\r\nvillages one and placed in it the thirty or so Indians whom they had\r\nbaptized. As the other Indians had withdrawn further to the north, the\r\nProvincial and Delgado determined to go after them. The Indian converts\r\nobjected to this, but the missionaries overcame their fears. In due\r\ntime they came to a certain hill which the natives worshiped as God of\r\nthe Mountains. Some Indian lads they had with them as servants urged\r\nthe Padres to place an offering of copal before this god in order to\r\npropitiate him and prevent him from destroying them all. Of course the\r\ntwo priests refused to give in to the superstitious fears of their\r\nservants. They said Mass instead. As a result all their followers, save\r\ntwo bearers, left them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indians are Friendly to them. Once the mountains had been safely\r\ncrossed, the Padres found that the Indians on the other side came to\r\nsee them readily enough. When the natives found that their white\r\nvisitors meant them no harm, they welcomed them and made a comfortable\r\npathway, over which they conducted the Padres.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Route Taken by the Two Padres. After some time they reached the\r\nshore of a large, fine river called Yaxha. There they encamped for a\r\nwhile, going on afterward to the house of a cacique named Matzin, who\r\nwas later christened Martin. He treated them very well and they founded\r\nthe village of San Jacinto Matzin and preached the Christian faith\r\nthere. Four leagues away lived another cacique, called Ilixil, to whom,\r\nin spite of the risk of hunger, they went. First founding a village\r\ncalled San Pedro y San Pablo Ilixil, the Padres baptized many children.\r\nIn that same village of Ilixil they met some Indians who had come\r\nthither from Cahabon and who offered to act as guides. With them the\r\nPadres went to a place called May. After several interesting\r\nadventures, told by Villagutierre (p. 157), they renamed the village\r\nSan Joseph May.\r\n\r\nThe rainy season shortly afterward began, and the missionaries retired\r\ntoward Cahabon, setting up crosses as landmarks at suitable places\r\nalong the way. When they regained their first village, San Lucas\r\nTzalac, they found matters much as they had left them. From San Lucas\r\nthey went to Cahabon, and from there to Cohan, in search of some\r\nIndians called Axoyes, of whom they had heard. In response to a call\r\nissued from Coban by Gallegos, one hundred and eighty persons came to\r\nhim. They had already been baptized and wanted only to confess.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral Villages Founded. On this trip Padres Gallegos and Delgado\r\nbaptized twenty-three hundred and forty-six persons and founded many\r\nvillages: San Lucas Tzalac, Nuestra Senora del Rosario, San Jacinto\r\nMatzin, San Pedro and San Pablo Ilixil, Assumpcion, San Joseph May, San\r\nMiguel Manche, San Francisco Sacomo (= Secouamo on Hendges 1902?), and\r\nSan Fernando Axoy. Villagutierre (p. 161) gives a long list of the\r\nplaces to which the Padres did not go.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dominicans and the Franciscans. We have already seen that most of\r\nthe curacies in Yucatan were in the hands of friars of the Franciscan\r\nOrder. In Guatemala, on the other hand, there was for a long time a\r\ndispute between the Dominicans and the Franciscans as to which should\r\nhave the privilege of proselytizing in Guatemala. This quarrel, which\r\nRemesal (p. 587 ff.) plainly thought disgraceful, was at its height\r\nfrom 1551 to 1560. On January 22, 1556, cedulas were dispatched from\r\nValladolid bidding both the orders to live at peace with each other.\r\nBoth orders had fine churches in Guatemala.\r\n\r\n\r\nStruggles between the Dominicans and the Indians. We have already\r\nnoticed how, as early as 1533, the King had expressed a wish to know\r\neverything possible about the dwellers in Guatemala. In 1555 the\r\nLacandones and Puchutla put to death the good Dominican missionary.\r\nFray Domingo de Vico. From that time there was a constantly growing\r\nwish on the part of the Spaniards to conquer those people, not only\r\nbecause they were not Christians and ate human flesh, but because they\r\nwere a constant menace. On January 22, 1556, a cedula was dispatched\r\nordering that the trouble-makers be reduced to obedience. (Remesal,\r\nlib. x, cap. 11.) For a long time after that bitter struggles between\r\nthe Dominicans and the Indians lasted, struggles which caused the\r\nSpaniards to give the name of Tierra de Guerra to the region. One of\r\nthe missionaries in this region. Fray Diego de Ribas, had some success\r\nin the region north of Huehuetenango in 1685. (Villagutierre, p. 176\r\nff.) He and his men opened up a road that led from Huehuetenango into\r\nthe regions north and east of there. They got on very well until they\r\ncame into contact with some Lacandones, who proved to be spies. From\r\nthat time on their troubles increased.\r\n\r\nFrom all this it is easy to deduce that the peoples to the south of the\r\nLacandones and Maya (such people as the Choles) were of a comparatively\r\ndocile temperament and were easily won over, temporarily, to the\r\nChristian faith. As soon, however, as the fiercer and more stubborn\r\nLacandones brought their influence to bear upon the converts, the\r\nlatter found that their attachment to the new religion was but\r\nsuperficial. (Remesal, lib. x, cap. 10.) Moreover, the lack of\r\nauthority to use armed force wherever necessary was another\r\ndisadvantage under which the missionaries labored. There can be but\r\nlittle doubt that they also were too hasty in their attempts to\r\nexchange the somewhat abstruse spiritual worship of the Catholic Church\r\nfor the veneration of tangible gods of stone or wood. They were quick\r\nto destroy the old and long-venerated gods, but they were unable to\r\nreplace them with something the Indians were able to understand.\r\n\r\nIn 1686 the King (Charles II), calling the Viceroy's attention to the\r\ngreat number of unconverted tribes in Guatemala, Yucatan, and\r\nelsewhere, ordered further reductions to be made, at once, but as\r\ngently as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Inception of the Plan to Subdue the Itzas, 1689. In 1689 Captain\r\nJuan de Mendoza wrote to the court to tell how the reductions had been\r\nbegun, and to ask that he might be placed at the head of fifty\r\nsoldiers. On the advice of Guzman, who had now returned from Guatemala\r\nto the Spanish court, his wish was granted. The following plan for\r\nthe reduction of the Choles and the Lacandones was decided upon.\r\n(Villagutierre, p. 190.)\r\n\r\nThree entradas were to be made at the same time. One from the province\r\nof Guatemala, which was in the hands of the Dominicans; a second from\r\nHuehuetenango, which was Mercedarian; and the third from Chiapas, which\r\nwas Dominican. Fray Augustin Cano, of the Order of Predicadores, and\r\nFray Diego de Ribas, of the Order of la Merced, were to go first and\r\ntry, by peaceful means, to accomplish their purpose. Mendoza was to try\r\nmore vigorous measures. Juan de Mendoza and his men were to be nothing\r\nmore than an escort to the Padres, and the conquest was to be\r\naccomplished only by the evangelical word.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoberanis Ordered to Cooperate. On November 24, 1692, like orders were\r\ngiven to Don Roque de Soberanis y Centeno, Governor of Yucatan, and he\r\nwas told to cooperate with President Barrios Leal of Guatemala.\r\nUnfortunately the enterprise was interrupted by the fact that unjust\r\naccusations caused a suspension of Leal's powers from 1691 to 1694.\r\n\r\n\r\nUrsua to Succeed Soberanis in Office. At about this time an arrangement\r\nwas made by the King whereby the Sargento Mayor Don Martin de Ursua y\r\nArizmendi[7.1] was to succeed Don Roque de Soberanis y Centeno in the\r\ngovernment of Yucatan. At the time Ursua was in Mexico, at the court of\r\nthe Viceroy. Ursua, who is to occupy much of our attention for some\r\ntime to come, wrote a letter to King Charles, which is given by\r\nVillagutierre (lib. iii, cap. 8) and which I here translate in part.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Letter from Ursua y Arizmendi to the King of the Spains. \"SIRE,--Your\r\nMajesty having had the graciousness to confer upon me the future\r\npossession of the Governorship of the Provinces of Yucatan, in which\r\npost I am to succeed Don Roque de Soberanis y Centeno, ... my\r\nemployment, during the time of my Governorship, is to be the Conversion\r\nand Reduction of the innumerable Indians, as well Infidel as Apostate,\r\nwho are between the said Provinces of Yucatan and those of Guatimala.\r\n(And I shall urge) the opening of a road from the one to the other, not\r\nonly to facilitate Commerce, which would be for the Public Convenience\r\nand the service of your Majesty, but would also make for the Reduction\r\nof the so many Indians.... So I propose to Your Majesty: That at my own\r\nexpense, and with no cost to the Royal Exchequer, when I shall have\r\nentered upon the Governorship and shall have made my Preparations, I\r\nshall put into execution the opening of a Highway from the Provinces of\r\nYucatan to those of Guatimala, at the same time reducing, by the\r\npeaceful means of the Evangelical Preaching, all the Indians who shall\r\nbe found in those regions. But the Conversion is not to interrupt the\r\nopening of the Road which is more important as it will facilitate the\r\nlater reduction of all those who live in those parts by the continuous\r\nPassing and Commerce of the Spaniards of both Provinces....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe King Grants all that Ursua Asks. In the memorial just mentioned\r\nUrsua asked that orders be given so that the prelates of the Order of\r\nSan Francisco, the President of the Audience of Guatemala, and the\r\nViceroy of New Spain should be obliged to give him every sort of aid\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nIn 1693 the King replied, saying that he had given the desired orders\r\nto the Viceroy of New Spain, the President of Guatemala, the Bishop of\r\nYucatan, and the Provincial of San Francisco. He then commanded that\r\ncare should be taken to choose the best places for bridges, that inns\r\nshould be established every four or eight leagues for the shelter of\r\ntravelers, and that every effort should be made to form settlements\r\nthat would insure the safety of travelers. As the work was not to begin\r\nuntil Ursua had entered upon his duties as Governor, the Viceroy, Conde\r\nde Galve, the Bishop, and others were unable, till well into 1694, to\r\naid the work they all wished to see brought to a successful conclusion.\r\nMeanwhile Barrios Leal was still under the stigma of a Visita or\r\nInspection. When his character was cleared of all blame, in the middle\r\nof 1694, he was told how the Itzas of Tayasal and other infidel nations\r\nwere infesting the country and committing various atrocities. Once\r\nBarrios Leal was restored, the reduction began in earnest.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Barrios Aids in the Undertaking. As soon as Barrios Leal was\r\nrestored to office as President of the Audience of Guatemala and\r\nas soon as circumstances permitted, active preparations for the\r\nlong-discussed conquest of the Itzas were begun.\r\n\r\nVillagutierre (lib. iv, cap. i) speaks thus of the preparations that\r\nwere made: \"We have already seen how intently President Don Jacinto de\r\nBarrios considered the hints which the Missionary Padres Fray Melchor\r\nLopez and Fray Antonio Margil[7.2] and other persons had made to him,\r\nurging the importance of setting about with all possible efficiency the\r\nreduction of Barbarism in those Woodlands. So he promptly began to take\r\nthe steps which seemed suitable in the matter.... It was resolved by\r\nall the leaders and ministers: That the Entrada for the reduction of\r\nthe Woodlands should be made at the beginning of the next year, 1695\r\n(which is the beginning of summer in those lands)....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nArrangements for the Entrada; Supplies, etc. Provisions were made\r\nwhereby men who voluntarily gave aid in money or in extra services to\r\nthose who were directing the entrada were to be advanced in rank over\r\ntheir fellows. Besides it was arranged that as soon as possible the\r\nreligious authorities were to give their necessary aid.\r\n\r\nJuan de Mendoza had already been named leader of the army, and as he\r\nwas absent from the province at the time, it was decided that the\r\nPresident should appoint as leaders those whom he thought best.\r\n\r\nVillagutierre (p. 219) continues: \"And the President was to call to the\r\nJunta de Guerra the Padres Maestros Fray Diego de Ribas, Fray Augustin\r\nCano, Fray Joseph Delgado, Fray Tomas Guerrero, and Fray Pedro Monzon,\r\nas well as other persons well versed in the frontiers, Entradas and\r\nWoodlands of the Infidels, because of the great value of their opinions\r\nin determining the methods of operation and the manner of penetrating\r\nthe forest region....\r\n\r\n\"Likewise, it was determined that the expenses they were planning to\r\nincur and which were found necessary, should be met from the Royal\r\nFunds and that the Royal Officers should issue orders for quantities of\r\nmaize, beans, chili, and fowl, which were to be collected with all\r\nspeed as part of the Royal Tribute from the Provinces of Vera Paz,\r\nChiapa, and Gueguetanango.\r\n\r\n\"And it was ordered that Spanish men-at-arms should be recruited at\r\nonce, and that notice of this determination should be given to the\r\nAlcaldes Mayores and to Don Roque de Soberanis y Centeno, Governor of\r\nthe Province of Yucatan.\r\n\r\n\"At this time the President had all the chief citizens of the City of\r\nGuatemala called together.... He urged each one to aid with his person\r\nor with whatever aid of his he could....\" The result of this appeal was\r\na quickened activity in the recruiting and in the collecting of\r\nsupplies and munitions of war. At the same time Don Joseph de Escals\r\nwas applied to for aid in the collecting of donations or voluntary\r\ngifts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Voluntary Contributions. Toward the end of 1694 the donations began\r\nto come pouring in. A list of them will give some idea of the scale on\r\nwhich operations were carried out.\r\n\r\nDon Joseph de Escals sent from Sonsonate 350 pesos, which he got by\r\nselling 56 horses given by the citizens.\r\n\r\nDon Juan Jeronimo de Mexia, Corregidor of Huehuetenango, 100 pesos from\r\nthe citizens and 100 of his own as well as 14 horses.\r\n\r\nQuasaltenango, 14 horses but no money.\r\n\r\nAcasaguastlan, through Captain Don Miguel de Azanon, its Corregidor, 34\r\nhorses but no money.\r\n\r\nChiquimula, 70 horses and 50 pesos.\r\n\r\nSoconusco, 30 horses and 6 mules.\r\n\r\nEsquintepeque and Guazacapan, 13 horses, 2 mules, and 23 pesos.\r\n\r\nSan Salvador, 60 horses, 11 mules, and 200 pesos.\r\n\r\nTeconicapa and Huehuetenango, 33 horses, 800 fowl, and 400 bushels of\r\nmaize.\r\n\r\nGuatemala, 1176 pesos, 49 horses, and 7 mules.\r\n\r\nDon Jacobo Barba of Zuchitepeque, 100 pesos.\r\n\r\nDon Francisco Lopez de Albizuri, two soldiers and paid for the entire\r\ntime of the campaign.\r\n\r\nDon Juan de Galvez, 20 horses.\r\n\r\nDon Estevan de Medrano, four soldiers for six months.\r\n\r\nThe totals of the donations were 2399 pesos, 354 horses, 22 mules, 420\r\nbushels of maize, 800 fowl, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuarrels between Soberanis and the Bishop of Yucatan. While matters\r\nwere going forward in a fairly satisfactory manner in Guatemala,\r\naffairs were quite unsatisfactory in Yucatan, where the quarrels\r\nbetween Don Roque de Soberanis and the Bishop of Yucatan retarded all\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\nAt length the Viceroy of Mexico despatched Don Francisco Sarasa as\r\nOidor to look into the situation and to report on it. As a result of\r\nhis investigations Soberanis was deprived of his office. Believing that\r\nhe could best defend himself by going in person to Mexico, Soberanis\r\nleft Yucatan for the viceregal court. The natural step for the Viceroy,\r\nConde de Galve, was to appoint Martin de Ursua y Arizmendi as Governor\r\n_ad interim_ and this was done.\r\n\r\nFinding himself in possession (albeit only temporarily) of the\r\ngovernment of Yucatan, and in view of the fact that he already held the\r\nnecessary orders and cedulas for the opening of the road to Guatemala\r\nand for the conversion of the Indians along the route, as well as the\r\nadvices from the President of Guatemala speaking of the matter, Ursua\r\ndecided it was best to put them into immediate execution.\r\n\r\nThe year 1695 was already started and it was necessary to set to work\r\nat once, not only on the actual work of the entrada, but also on the\r\ntask of getting the good will of the Cabildo of the city of Merida, of\r\nthe Bishop, of the province of San Francisco, and of the Count of\r\nGalve, Viceroy of New Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Barrios Decides to Join the Entrada in Person. Villagutierre\r\n(lib. iv, cap. 4) goes on to inform us that after enough arms,\r\nmunitions, food supplies, and small gifts for the Indians were got\r\ntogether, and just as the troops and the monks were on the point of\r\nsetting off on their march to the woodlands. President Barrios Leal\r\nmade up his mind to go with them in person. Villagutierre (p. 228) thus\r\ngraphically describes the effect of his proposal: \"In spite of the fact\r\nthat the Ecclesiastical and Secular Cabildos of that City of Guatemala\r\ntried to dissuade him from his plan, urging him to notice that although\r\nthat undertaking was so glorious and so much to the service of God and\r\nthe King, and so greatly favored by all, by the public welfare and by\r\nthe good of Christendom, he ought not to risk his life so wantonly upon\r\nit; and although they also warned him of the terribleness of the\r\nattacks which were always suffered in the stomach because of the\r\nhardships of the painful journey and country ride, bad resting-places,\r\nworse roads and lack of assistance, rest and tranquillity, which would\r\nput his health in evident danger, so that all felt he ought to give up,\r\nor at least postpone his journey until he was more hale and hearty in\r\nhealth; in spite of all these and other objections nothing arose from\r\nall these representations, and fears which sufficed to change the\r\nfervent zeal of the bold President who, in replying, first thanked them\r\nall for the great attention and affection with which they looked to his\r\nconvenience, and then said that the greatest safety lay only in his\r\nbeing the first in all dangers in the service of Both Majesties.\"\r\n\r\nThe gallant old President (who appears to have been subject to\r\napoplectic seizures) wished to be in command of the army, but in case\r\nhe were forced to fall back at any time to a place of safety, he\r\nappointed an assistant, who was Don Bartolome de Amezquita, Fiscal of\r\nthat Audience of Guatemala.\r\n\r\nAmezquita, then, was Captain General of the entrada, taking the Chiapas\r\ndivision. Captain Juan Diaz de Velasco was made leader of the Vera Paz\r\ndivision. Don Tomas de Mendoza y Guzman was made leader of the\r\nHuehuetenango division.\r\n\r\nWhen the pay, supplies, and baggage had been distributed among the\r\nsoldiers, the President gave out his final orders as to the length of a\r\nday's journey. He had already sent ahead to the Alcalde Mayor of\r\nOcozingo in Chiapas ordering that suitable _ranchos_ be put up in\r\ncertain places to shelter the royal army when it should arrive. While\r\nthe Indians of Ocozingo were working on these they had been attacked by\r\nsome Lacandon Indians when scarcely a house had been completed. All\r\nthese unmistakable evidences of the proximity of the notorious\r\nLacandones made Barrios choose the Chiapas division for himself, as it\r\nwas the most likely to come across them.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the President ordered Don Tomas (de Mendoza?) de\r\nGuzman to go ahead with one hundred men and act as escort for the\r\nIndians while they were putting up the houses near Ocozingo or any more\r\nconvenient place. Barrios had already informed Ursua that he intended\r\nto set out in January, 1695, and the latter was to enter the unsubdued\r\narea from the north at the same time. Surveyors were to go ahead of the\r\nmain body of men, and by means of smudges were to afford the greatest\r\npossible facility for the road openers, who thus would be prevented\r\nfrom going astray.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Expedition Sets out from Guatemala City. At length the expedition\r\nreally did start. (Villagutierre, pp. 234 ff.) Besides the soldiers and\r\nIndian bearers there were many friars, among whom were Padre Fray Diego\r\nde Ribas, Padre Fray Antonio Margil, Missionary Padre Fray Pedro de la\r\nConcepcion, Master Cano, and others. As the army set off, all the\r\ncitizens and nobility of Guatemala flocked to see them. The first day's\r\njourney led to Ixtapa, where they spent the night; the next day they\r\nwent to Pazon, then to Huehuetenango, which they entered on January 23,\r\n1695, having journeyed forty-six leagues from Guatemala.\r\n\r\nIn Huehuetenango the President, the monks, the officers, and the men\r\nall met with a warm welcome from the inhabitants. It is but natural\r\nthat, on the eve of an undertaking which must have appeared very\r\nformidable to them, a large part of the time should be given up to\r\nreligious exercises. Captain Melchor Rodriguez Mazariegos joined the\r\nparty at the head of fifty men. Mazariegos himself, together with the\r\nstandard-bearer Juan Salvador de Mata and Sergeant Pedro de Chaves\r\nGalindo, were all serving without pay, and many other people from the\r\nregion, as well as some from Tabasco, joined the army voluntarily.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents at Huehuetenango. On January 29, Amezquita arrived from\r\nGuatemala, where he had been making some final arrangements. Barrios\r\nspent his time at Huehuetenango in paying the new troops, distributing\r\nhorses and supplies, and making all the final arrangements.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the news of the departure of the President\r\nreached Ursua in Yucatan. (Villagutierre, pp. 235 ff.) The whole\r\nenterprise was so important for the service of God, the King, the\r\npublic weal, and the souls of the Indians that Ursua immediately set\r\nabout his preparations for the share his government was to take in it.\r\n\r\n\r\nUrsua's Activities. Ursua did not follow the example of the President\r\nby going in person at the head of his troops; instead he ordered\r\nCaptain Alonso Garcia de Paredes, Perpetual Regidor of San Francisco de\r\nCampeche and Captain for War of the District of Sacabchen, to assemble\r\nwhat troops he could and to go with them to meet the President, under\r\nwhose orders he should place himself, reporting to Ursua all\r\noccurrences of importance. For all this Ursua gave Paredes the title of\r\nAide or the Captain General of las Montanas. Francisco Gonzalez\r\nRichardo was appointed subchief, second in command only to Ursua.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Army Sets out from Yucatan for the Montana. When all the usual and\r\nneedful preparations had been made, the army set out from Yucatan. As\r\nsoon as they left the settled part of the province they entered the\r\nterritory of the Quehaches, whom they put to flight after a sharp\r\nskirmish. Paredes' soldiers, however, refused to go on without\r\nreenforcements, so the expedition had to turn back.\r\n\r\n\r\nPadres Cano and Avendano y Loyola. We have already reviewed the events\r\nup to 1695, in which year the two great divisions of the Spanish forces\r\nset out to subdue the dangerous Itzas and Lacandones. Hereafter we\r\nwill, in the main, trust to two religious writers, whose accounts of\r\nthe succeeding events are very vivid. Maestro Fray Agustin Cano\r\naccompanied that division of the army which was led by President\r\nBarrios; Padre Fray Andres de Avendano y Loyola, a Franciscan,\r\naccompanied Ursua's division.\r\n\r\n\r\nCano's Account of the Entrada from Guatemala. For the sake of\r\ncontinuity we will begin by quoting Cano's account of the entrada from\r\nGuatemala: \"My Lord, Your Majesty having been pleased to appoint me in\r\nthe Royal decree of Nov. 24, 1692, to enter into the territories of the\r\nheathen, to try to bring about their conquest, in the due obedience and\r\nexecution of which, I personally took part in the expeditions into\r\nthose lands which they have made during these years through the\r\nProvince of Vera Paz, wishing to correspond to the Royal favor by which\r\nYour Majesty has been pleased to appoint me for this purpose; I\r\nunderstand that it is my duty to inform Your Majesty of what has\r\nhappened in these expeditions, making up for the delay of this report\r\nby the simple truth and clearness of the information which up to the\r\npresent time could not be given without a great deal of confusion on\r\naccount of the strange character of the events.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Route Followed by Cano. \"The President [Barrios] ... finally\r\ndetermined to enter by way of Chiapas, and that I should go by way of\r\nVera Paz with Captain Juan Diaz de Velasco and seventy men as an escort\r\nto the priests. Accordingly, in the month of March, of the said year\r\n'95, we started from the town of Cahabon, which is the last town of\r\nVera Paz; seven priests of my order, and we entered by very rough paths\r\ninto the highlands of the Chol, where we found many Indians, some\r\nbaptized, others heathen, and the more we penetrated those highlands,\r\nthe more numerous did we find the families in their hamlets, without\r\nthe form of towns. We told all these people that the object of our\r\njourney was to search for them so that they should come together in\r\ntowns in such a way that we should be able to come and live with them\r\nin order to teach them the law of God and to administer the holy\r\nSacraments to them, and that we also wished that all the people of\r\ntheir tribe and of all the other tribes in those highlands should know\r\nGod, and should come together in towns. Thus we went, passing from some\r\nfarms to others in prosecution of our journey to the Lake, and we left\r\nall the Indians peaceful and satisfied with the promise which they made\r\nus to gather together in towns. In this we were obtaining plenty of\r\ngood results, since we taught them the Christian doctrine of which most\r\nof the baptized Indians were totally ignorant. The children whom their\r\nfathers brought to us were baptized, and the grown people confessed\r\nthemselves, many who had relapsed were consecrated anew, and the Holy\r\nSacraments were administered to some Christian Indians who were found\r\ndying in their houses.\r\n\r\n\"After passing through the Province of Chol, which stretches from\r\nCahabon forty-five or fifty leagues, we came upon another tribe which\r\nis called the Mopanes, among whom Spaniards or ministers of the holy\r\ngospel had never entered, and, although the difference in language was\r\nof some embarrassment, God willed that we should find some Mopan\r\nIndians who understood the Chol language and by means of these we\r\ndeclared to them the purpose of our journey. This had good results at\r\nthat time in the case of some adults, who, being dangerously ill, asked\r\nfor holy baptism, and in the case of some sick children whom their\r\nfathers brought and who went to Heaven as the first-fruits among this\r\ntribe. Their principal cacique, Taximchan, fled from us, and although\r\nwe made various endeavors to draw him to us, he always deceived us with\r\nfalse promises. But we made friends with four other caciques of this\r\ntribe of the Mopanes Indians, called, in their paganism, the Cacique\r\nZac, the Cacique Tuzben, the Cacique Yahcab, and the Cacique Tezecum.\r\nThey came to see us with a part of their families, and every day there\r\ncame many Mopanes Indians to buy knives and many other little trifles\r\nwhich the soldiers sold in exchange for blankets. We presented them\r\nwith salt, and for this they came to see us and to sell us their fruit,\r\nand apparently they were becoming friendly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chols and the Mopanes. \"On account of the many Indians who came\r\nevery day to see us, and of the many farms and farm-buildings which we\r\nsaw in those highlands, we knew that that tribe of Mopanes was very\r\nnumerous. They all go naked like the Chols, and differ from them only\r\nin their hair, in that they do not wear it of the same length like the\r\nChols, but cut the hair on the front part of the head and only wear it\r\nlong behind. It is a race more robust and barbarous than the Chols;\r\nthey have idols of diabolical forms, some of which we found, and they\r\nhave many other superstitions, about which it would take long to tell.\r\nWe found very little frankness in their nature and we found that they\r\nhave relations with the Ahizaes Indians of the Lake; and we even\r\nlearned that they all were of one Ytza nation, calling themselves Mopan\r\nYtza; Peten Ytza and these Mopanes were subject to the petty King of\r\nthe Lake, about which and about its Island of Peten and about its\r\ncaciques they gave us much information, although they always refused to\r\nshow us the way thither. Nevertheless, we prevailed upon the Cacique\r\nZac to show us the way from Mopan as far as the first plain, and from\r\nthere forward our guide was the Cacique Yahcab, who knew the Chol\r\nlanguage, by means of which he served as an interpreter, though a very\r\nunskilled one.\r\n\r\n\"In this way we had some means of prosecuting our journey to the Lake,\r\nand having written to the President by way of Vera Paz what had been\r\ndone, and leaving in Mopan two priests to take care of those Indians,\r\nwith twenty men for their protection, we priests, five in number,\r\npassed onward with Captain Juan Diaz de Velasco and fifty men.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Mopan to the Lake. \"We traveled from Mopan toward the Lake a\r\nmatter of thirty-two leagues, in which the confusion of our guide and\r\ninterpreter, the Cacique Yahcab, delayed us much more than our\r\nignorance of the way; for he, whether from his want of knowledge, or\r\nfrom malice, said at each stream or small river that there was no more\r\nwater till we reached the Lake. Having then come to a small river\r\ncalled Chacal, we made a halt while some of our men crossed with the\r\nguide and proceeded to reconnoiter the path, and they went forward in\r\nsuch a way that they reached the Lake and discovered the great _Peten_\r\nor island which stands in the middle of it, and which, according to the\r\nstory of those who went there, must be distant from Chacal a matter of\r\nfourteen or sixteen leagues. Our people met many Ahizaes Indians, who\r\ncame from the Lake to the shore armed with bows and arrows, and they,\r\nat the first sight of our people, got their bows ready; but the Indian\r\nYahcab, who had been told what to do, calmed them by telling them that\r\nwe were traders, which the Ahizaes heard with much pleasure. But when\r\nthe said interpreter of ours went on to tell them that with these\r\nmerchants were some Padres to teach them the law of God, the Ahizaes\r\nraised a great whispering among themselves; and as our people were\r\nunable to give the Ahizaes more reasons than those which that rude\r\ninterpreter had studied and offered, there was no way to pacify them,\r\nand it was not known what they said, but all was confusion and\r\ndisturbance, which resulted in fighting and general encounters, in\r\nwhich our men received no damage, but of the Ahizaes some were killed\r\nand wounded and two of them were captured; one of these was called\r\nQuixan and the other Chan. These two Indians uniformly said that the\r\nAhizaes had taken up arms because they had had notice that we had come\r\nto Mopan, and that they had not perceived any other people in their\r\nlands either in the direction of Yucatan or in any other direction;\r\nwhich agreed with our not having any sign either from the people who\r\nwent with the said President Don Jacinto, nor of those whom he had sent\r\nwith the Padres de la Merced, although we made every effort to find\r\nthem. I wished that the said two Indians, or one of them, should go\r\nwith a message for his companions, but the affair was so stained with\r\nblood, and the time was so advanced that it did not permit of these\r\ndelays, and the Captain gave sufficient reason for a contrary decision;\r\nand the Ahiza Indian called Chan quickly removed any doubt by fleeing\r\nby night, as a result of which we took more care of the remaining\r\nIndian called Quixan. Seeing, then, that at that time we were not able\r\nto get any result in that Ahiza nation, as they had taken up arms and\r\nwe, not understanding their language, were not able to persuade them\r\nnor to come to an agreement with them; so that, if we went on, it would\r\nonly be to continue a war against the will of our Majesty, as expressed\r\nin the Royal decree, and without any hope of good results, since we\r\nwere not able to enter into the Island for want of canoemen and of\r\ninstruments to make canoes, and for the same reason we could not go\r\nacross the Lake in search of the people of the said President.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCano Advises Return. \"Seeing also that the rains were beginning with\r\ngreat fury, and that our people were becoming sick because of the\r\nchange of weather, to which was added our finding ourselves in such\r\nwant of supplies that we scarcely had what was needed to return to\r\nMopan; for these reasons I advised the Captain that we should return to\r\nMopan, and that there we should await news of the said President, and\r\nthat when we had received this news we should see what ought to be\r\ndone. This plan we carried out, taking in our company the Ahiza Indian\r\ncalled Quixan, treating him kindly and carefully.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExplanations of their Withdrawal Sent to Guatemala. At this juncture an\r\nunfortunate controversy sprang up. Cano says that he and his companions\r\nwrote to Guatemala, explaining why they had withdrawn. Their\r\nexplanations were not accepted, however, because a false report had\r\ngained credence to the effect that Don Jacinto Barrios had reached Lake\r\nPeten. The authorities in Guatemala persisted in believing the latter\r\nreport, and they charged the Padres with trying to discredit the\r\nPresident. The General Assembly then issued a decree in which they\r\nordered Captain Velasco at once to return to the lake and fortify\r\nhimself there on pain of losing all his property like a traitor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Decree of the General Assembly. \"This was the substance of the\r\ndecree which was despatched to us, with many other circumstances in a\r\nline with the ends and false bases on which the whole was founded.\r\n\r\n\"We received this decree in Mopan, with many other letters of the same\r\ntenor, so that beside the ordinary troubles (common to all), I had this\r\none in addition to lay before our Lord.... Other letters [arrived] from\r\nthe said President, D. Jacintho, written from a place of the\r\nLacandones, which we called Nuestra Senora de las Dolores, where he had\r\njoined the people who had entered the country with the Padres de la\r\nMerced. In these letters he replied to those which we had written when\r\nwe entered Mopan, and he gave orders in these that the men should\r\nretire, leaving thirty men as an escort in that place, since the rainy\r\nseason was beginning, and because he was doing the same thing on his\r\npart; by this we knew that the second basis of the decree did not\r\nexist, since the President found himself in Lacandon, which is so far\r\naway from the Lake of Ahiza....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nQuarrels among the Soldiers and the Officials. The entrada from\r\nGuatemala came to a close to the accompaniment of incessant and petty\r\nwrangling on the part of the soldiery and of the officials.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Writers of the Decree Punished. It is good to know, however, that\r\nthe writers of the decree were punished by a sound reprimand. Cano was\r\nreinstated in the respect of all. He tells the plans for future work in\r\nthese words: \"... He [President Barrios] intended going again the\r\nfollowing year by the Province of Vera Paz.... For this purpose I\r\nproposed to the said President that it was necessary that those roads\r\nshould be constructed in such a way that the supplies could be carried\r\nin mule packs and not on the shoulders of Indians; and that the tools\r\nshould be provided for building canoes and boats,--also officers and\r\nseamen who should know how to manage them, since in no other way was it\r\npossible to enter the Island or _Peten_ of Ahiza. All this was ordered\r\nto be provided and carried out; but it was not carried out fully on\r\naccount of the protracted and distressing illness of the said\r\nPresident, which grew worse and worse every day. So that God permitted\r\nthat from this storm should result one calm death, and that, through\r\nantagonistic means, there should be added new delays to this\r\nconversion.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile there were not wanting priests of good courage who wished to\r\ntake part in the conversion of these souls, and Fray Diego Palomino\r\nhaving died in the highlands of Chol from illness which attacked him\r\nthere, God moved the Reverend Reader, Fray Christobal de Prada, with\r\nsuch powerful inclinations, that while he was giving a course in\r\nphilosophy in this convent of Guatemala with great credit and esteem,\r\nand without being detained by the love of his scholars or the arguments\r\nof his friends, he gave up his chair and went to the wilderness, where\r\nhe devoted himself with so much fervor and zeal to the education of\r\nthose heathen that in a short time he perfected himself in the language\r\nof Chol, of which he had already learned the rudiments; and he went\r\nahead of every one in the Mopan or Ahiza languages, without a master or\r\ngrammar of the said language, but only with what help he was able to\r\nget from the Mopan and Chol Indians, of whom he brought together many\r\nwho had fled before he went into the wilderness.\"\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the events described in this chapter resulted in the\r\nsubjection of the Itzas, but not, however, through the agency of the\r\npeople of Guatemala. We shall learn from the account of Fray Andres de\r\nAvendano y Loyola all that occurred in the year 1695-1696.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n               THE FIRST AND UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT MADE BY\r\n               FRAY ANDRES DE AVENDANO Y LOYOLA TO REACH\r\n                 THE ITZAS OF TAYASAL, 1695-1696\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out in the Introduction that Avendano's Relacion is\r\nof very great value as a first-hand account of the conquest of the\r\nItzas. But we must not lose sight of the fact that that same Relacion\r\nis also a wonderful, though unconscious, testimony to the piety,\r\nunselfishness, and bravery of him who wrote it. Undoubtedly the priests\r\nof the Roman Catholic Church did many unjust things during the period\r\nof Spanish domination in the New World, but the number of good and\r\nnoble deeds done by them (deeds the bulk of which is unrecorded)\r\ncompletely dwarfs the evil. Avendano was a type of the best sort of\r\npriest in the New World. Impelled by no other motive than sheer faith\r\nand an ardent desire to do the duty of his office, he went through the\r\nevents which we will leave him to relate.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreamble. \"I, Fray Andres de Avendano y Loyola, ... accompanied by my\r\nPadres and Preachers Fray Antonio Perez de San Roman, Apostolic notary\r\nof the first trip; Fray Joseph de Jesus Maria, Apostolic notary of the\r\nsecond trip, and Fray Diego de Echebarria, ... made this first trip\r\n[beginning] on the 3d of June of the past year of 1695, and the second,\r\non which we entered the nation of the Ytzaex, began on the 13th of\r\nDecember of the said year, and we returned to this city of Merida on\r\nthe 6th of April of this year of 1696....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPreparations for the Journey. \"... Here begins the historical account,\r\nwhich, with the divine aid, I am attempting to tell of the casualties\r\nand events which happened in this journey for the conversion of souls,\r\nwhile opening a road from this Province to that of Guatemala, taking as\r\nmy sure loadstar the honor and glory of God and the well-being of\r\nsouls, which, at the cost of unextinguishable fervor, Senor Don Martin\r\nde Urssua y Arismendi[8.1] Provisional Governor and Captain-General of\r\nthese provinces for his Majesty, is attempting to bring about; with\r\nnone the less support of the Senor Oidor Don Francisco de Saraza, who\r\nat the present time resides in the city of Merida de Yucatan. Today,\r\nthe 2d of June of this present year 1695 ... I, then, armed with so\r\nstrong an armor of faith, say that God, our Lord, having moved the\r\nhearts of these two above-mentioned gentlemen, so that, besides their\r\nundertaking other enterprises of his Majesty (whom may God guard), the\r\nfervent zeal of the said Don Martin de Urssua y Arismendi found an\r\nopportunity, the Senor Oidor (as has been said) favoring it, for\r\ncarrying out a journey,--two messengers these, both as acceptable to\r\nGod as deserving in the service of the royal crown, since in fulfilling\r\nthe duty of his office of Provisional Governor, [Ursua] did not waste\r\nat all the precious jewel of time, but put into execution, in addition\r\nto the difficult work of government, this most difficult and special\r\nwork which his Majesty granted to him of opening the wild road from\r\nthis province to that of Guatemala, without satisfying the eagerness of\r\nhis zeal, in spite of the excessive cost of the undertaking; for he\r\ngave all the supplies necessary for one hundred and fifteen Spaniards\r\nand one hundred and fifty-six Indian musketeers, for which he, jointly\r\nwith the Municipality of Campeche and other special friends, paid,\r\njoining mutually not only in the payment of wages, but also sharing the\r\nexpense of provisions.... Among those who joined in this mission were\r\nthe Padre Preacher, Fray Juan de San Buena Ventura, and the Padre\r\nPreacher, Fray Joseph de Jesus Maria, both living in the convent of the\r\nSanta Recoleccion of this city of Merida, and Brother Fray Tomas de\r\nAlcoser, lay friar, and Brother Lucas, lay Brother of the said convent.\r\nAll of these composed or established one mission. And the Padre\r\nPreacher, Fray Antonio Perez de San Roman, holding the office of\r\napostolic notary, with the lay Brother, Alonso de Vargas, and I, the\r\nmost unworthy of all, who went as their delegate apostolic\r\nmissionary....\r\n\r\n\"The aforesaid Provisional Governor [Ursua] was not satisfied with this\r\nenterprise alone, and, without considering the greatness of the cost,\r\nas his fidelity to His Majesty developed, he disposed of his services\r\nso that at one and the same time to drive out some Englishmen (as he\r\ndid with glory enough of his own) who inhabited the lands of Zacatone,\r\nadjoining this province, and who lived there on account of their large\r\nprofits in logwood. He gave the assistance needed for this duty to\r\nCaptain Bernardo de Lizarraga, and he executed it with double\r\nvictories; and then, not sparing the ploughing of the foaming waves, he\r\nmade four captures in his first victory, in order to gain his second.\r\nAs a skillful man he went with all his men into the wild woods of\r\npathless thickets, where, though with great risk, falling upon the\r\nenemy in the rear, he made his second attack, again gaining as spoils\r\nof his second victory, other prizes, and driving out from there the\r\nsaid English enemies. I speak no more of this, as it does not belong in\r\nthis place.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Start. \"Therefore in prosecution of the aforesaid trip, I started\r\nwith the Padres as my companions on the second day of June of the year\r\n'95, with a very broad mandate which the aforesaid Provisional Governor\r\ngave me, so that I could take the singers and sacristans, who of their\r\nfree will wished to follow me; exempting, as a privilege, from taxes,\r\nthose who followed me, and their wives and children....\"[8.2]\r\n\r\n\r\nIndian Singers. \"On my showing the above mandate to the magistrates of\r\nthe towns through which I passed, there were at once Indians provided\r\nto accompany me besides those who went with me, who were the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n      Marcos Canul, Master of the Chapel of the town of Calkini.\r\n      Lorenzo Yah, servant of Captain Belasco.\r\n      Nicolas Mas, singer of Mascanu.\r\n      Diego Mo, sacristan of Mascanu.\r\n      Diego Cen, collector of alms of San Christobal.\r\n      Diego Pol, singer of Telchao.\r\n      Francisco Ku, son of Max Chuz, my servant.\r\n      Nicolas Mai, singer of Bolonchen, and he died there.\r\n      Manuel Piste, singer of Bolonchen de Cauich.\r\n      Luis Ci, sacristan of Tepakam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nArrival at Cauich. \"With them I went to the last pueblo of this\r\nprovince through that part called Cauich, where I found Captain Don\r\nJuan del Castillo, placed there by the Governor, in charge, not only of\r\nthe soldiers, but also of their arms, ammunition, and supplies; and he\r\nshowed himself singularly kind to us. On the second day, having reached\r\nthe said town, we found an Indian named Juan Ake, a native of the\r\npueblo of Hoppelchen, who made many trips in the forests to trade with\r\nthe heathen Indians. From him, with some finesse and gentle\r\npersuasions, I extracted the information of three pueblos of heathen\r\nIndians, which were found fifty leagues from there, with the names and\r\ndescriptions, which we verified afterwards.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDeparture from Cauich. \"We started from this pueblo of Cauich well\r\ncontent with this good news in the afternoon of the day of Saint John\r\nthe Baptist, after having celebrated his festival with all the\r\nspiritual rejoicings which the starting on such a difficult enterprise\r\ndemanded, beginning from this afternoon to reap some fruits of our\r\njourney, since we took this journey in retribution of our sins. In a\r\nlittle while a heavy rain-storm caught us, which lasted from the\r\nevening till the dawn of the next day, with such a tempest of\r\nlightnings and thunders that the mechanism of the celestial orbs seemed\r\nto dissolve. The place where we slept this night is called Hobonmo, two\r\nlong leagues distant from the said town of Cauich. Here God worked a\r\nmanifest miracle with my boy, for a viper of the most poisonous kind\r\nwhich are found in this province, called in this idiom _Kancnah_, came\r\nto repose on the mat on which my boy slept, and stayed there resting by\r\nthe side of his face, until he moved and gave an opportunity to the\r\nfrightened boy to rise; and when we lighted a light, we saw it and the\r\nIndians killed it without it doing any harm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAguada of Hobon Ox; Chunzalam, Vecanxan. \"We proceeded in the morning\r\nof the next day from the said place, a distance of one league, where we\r\nfound a _haltun_, that is, a hollowed stone, which usually contains\r\nwater. It is called Hobon Ox. At the distance of two leagues from this\r\n_haltun_ is found another place called Chunzalam, with an _aguada_\r\ncalled Kalceh. One league from this place is found another _aguada_ on\r\nthe right hand. It is called Vecanxan. A little after this we found a\r\nsmall plain on the left hand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n'Nohhalali Th[=a] Ayn, Sucte. \"At the distance of three-fourths of a\r\nleague is found another _aguada_ called Nohhalal, and after this is\r\nfound another _aguada_ called Th[=a] Ayn, and a little further on,\r\nsomething like half a league, are found some columns of round stone,\r\nwhich the natives say have served as an altar for the chaplain of the\r\nSpaniards, whose Captain is called Mirones. At the side of the said\r\ncolumns is found a well, narrow and round and somewhat deep, although\r\nthe mystery of what its purpose is, is never revealed. At a distance of\r\nhalf a league from this place is found another _haltun_ with very good\r\nwater, and a league from this is found the place called Sucte, worthy\r\nof memory on account of the things which it contains. First, this place\r\nis a plain or meadow, the largest which I have seen up to this time,\r\nand it extends on all sides out of sight. The whole covered with trees\r\nwith a small fruit called _Nanren_, and other trees called _Guazes_, so\r\nthat all of them make a design, by their standing in such order that\r\nthey appear to have been planted for the purpose. So that this _savana_\r\nis very beautiful on all sides. In the middle of it is found an\r\n_aguada_, well provided, although in the dry season it is apt to be\r\ndried up. To the South of the said _savana_, at a distance of a quarter\r\nof a league, within a thicket is found another _aguada_ with better and\r\nmore water, from its being spring water. It rises and falls like the\r\nsea, although the sea is distant, from it, in its nearest parts,\r\ntwenty-six leagues. It breeds in it very good fish and very large\r\n_caimans_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIx Kata-Kal. \"At a distance of a league from this place there is\r\nanother, Ix Kata-Kal, though it does not always contain water. The said\r\n_aguada_ is found on the Eastern side of the road. On the remainder of\r\nthis road at a distance of three leagues, there are only found some\r\n_haltuns_ or hollowed stones, which relieve the necessities of many\r\nthirsty people, but not in the dry season. As we passed by them, all\r\nthe path was rough and stony, so that from the fatigue of going over it\r\non foot, we had great trouble from the want of water until we reached a\r\nplace called Nohku, to which from the aforesaid _savana_ is four very\r\nlong leagues.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNohku. \"In this place we experienced comfort enough, since God had\r\nprovided us with food and drink enough to aid us in passing the day of\r\nthe glorious Apostles, Saint Peter and Saint Paul, so that in that\r\nplace we said mass. And in it we found a house of idols, so that,\r\nalthough the Spaniards who passed first had broken many, we broke more\r\nthan fifty others, putting in their place a cross, in order to give to\r\nGod the reverence and worship which the idolaters of the place usurped\r\nfor themselves. From this report which we heard there grew in us all a\r\nChristian curiosity to see the said place in order to exorcise the\r\ndevil on account of his frauds and to glorify and praise him who is\r\npowerful everywhere. We came back from seeing the said place about the\r\nhour of vespers, which were celebrated with as much outward and inward\r\nrejoicing as was possible in that place. We arranged the altar as\r\ndecently as we could, through the influence of which and our own\r\nChristian character, the Indians, without being forced to, also\r\nresolved to confess and to receive the sacraments (for the example of\r\nthe chiefs is a great thing), so that, without forcing them by words,\r\ntheir subjects silently followed them....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNohvecan. \"We left this place well contented, although with our feet\r\nwearied and wounded by the roughness of the road and we walked a\r\ndistance of four leagues to another place called Nohvecan, which place,\r\nfor a league before and a league after, consists of great overflowed\r\nstretches which in this language are called _Akalchees_. It can be well\r\nunderstood what pain we endured with our sore legs and feet passing\r\nthrough this two leagues of water and mud, which at the least came up\r\nover our knees, leaving us almost crippled; another great hardship\r\nbeing added, as soon as we came to an end of this trip, which is the\r\nabundance of mosquitoes, which did not allow us rest by day or night.\r\nThere is in this place an _aguada_ which is very large and deep and\r\nwhich in the rainy season becomes a river full of water. There are\r\nfound in the said place some trees, the bark of which is in smell and\r\ntaste the same as the cinnamon. It is called in this idiom,\r\n_Ppelizkuch_; also on the paths is found a vine, which, on touching it,\r\nsmells of garlic. The odor reaches a distance of a quarter of a league.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHardships Suffered by the Padres. \"This torment was followed by another\r\nvery heavy storm of wind which seemed to tear up the trees by the\r\nroots, with a great fall of rain, thunder and lightning, which\r\nafflicted our hearts. So that imitating in our weakness the Apostle\r\nSaint Peter in another similar storm, which befell him on the sea, we\r\nhad recourse to God with 'Lord, save us, we perish'; though by\r\nimitating him in every thing, we deserved the reproval of our weakness,\r\nby the answer which Christ gave to his Apostles, when he calmed the\r\nstorm by his power; for there he reproved them with these words, 'Why\r\nare ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Wherefore do you doubt?', his\r\nmost holy Majesty showing his pity at once.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOppol; a Bridge Built across a River. \"On the next day early, warned by\r\nwhat had happened in that place, at the first steps which we took in\r\nthe prosecution of our trip, we passed another league of swamp with the\r\nsame misery as we had the preceding one, as far as a place called\r\nOppol, which is three leagues from this place. In it to the Northwest,\r\nat a distance of a quarter of a league, is found a deep _aguada_, from\r\nwhich our company provided itself with water needed for consumption.\r\nTwo leagues from this place, beyond a deserted old town, there is found\r\na running stream (although accidental) so that, to pass over it, we\r\nmade a bridge. The water is very good, though in the rainy season it\r\nwill be difficult to pass, like many others which we have found dry,\r\nthrough our not having come in the rainy season; for when the force of\r\nthe river comes through the said places, the roads would be impassable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTanche. \"Two leagues beyond this river is found a place called Tanche,\r\nwhich is found on the brow of a lofty hill-top and in sight of another\r\nvery high ridge in a westerly direction from this rancho. At more than\r\nhalf a league off is found the _aguada_ from which the thirsty satisfy\r\ntheir need. A league and a half from this _rancho_ towards the South\r\n(we follow this direction) is found another permanent river with an\r\nartificial bridge, which cannot be passed in any other way. All the\r\nroads are very much overflowed on account of the many ridges which\r\nsurround them. They call this river Yochalek.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDeserted Village of Temchay. \"From this place to an old deserted town\r\ncalled Temchay is three leagues. It has its _aguada_, but it does not\r\ncontain water except in the rainy season. We suffered great thirst,\r\nbecause we had come with the hope that we should satisfy our needs\r\nthere, and we did not find anything but hard work enough, in repeating\r\nour day's march, and in the fact that the hills were rough with many\r\nups and downs, and with more footprints of mountain Indians, who passed\r\nby there, although these footprints were not recent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNohpek. \"Suffering from the scarcity of water, we continued our way for\r\nthe space of three leagues farther, to a great _haltun_, or hollowed\r\nstone, which held a great deal of water and which God willed that we\r\nshould find full. This place is called Nohpek. At the side of this\r\n_haltun_ we found a _milpa_ well sown and provided with _chiles_, which\r\nin the midst of our work served our hunger, so that, with a little\r\nmaize which we cooked, we had that day a cheerful meal; although to the\r\ncheer there did not fail to be added a little bitterness; since in one\r\nof the _ranchos_ where we lodged we found a tree which in that language\r\nis called _Pomolche_. This produced a fruit of the same form as the\r\nhazel nuts of Spain, as well in the shell as in the kernel, color,\r\nsmell, and taste. Curiosity led us to see if they were really hazel\r\nnuts. We ate some of the kernels for some time, without finding any\r\ndifference. Therefore as quite a time passed in which there was no\r\neffect other than what we expected, the Indians ate also, so as to\r\nimitate us in everything. Eating the said kernels caused us some\r\nthirst, giving us occasion to drink water, and we had scarcely drunk\r\nit, when we all burst out with vomitings and violent diarrhoeas. Two\r\nleagues on from this place, a part of the army of Spaniards was found,\r\nand knowing that I was on the way, there came to receive me two priests\r\nwho were of those who had preceded me, with two soldiers; and one of\r\nthem, having had the same thing happen to him with the said fruit, said\r\nthat their remedy was a draught of wine. We took the remedy and after\r\nwe had purged ourselves thoroughly, we were, of a sudden, well.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNohthub. \"From this place it is two long leagues to an old deserted\r\nplace called Nohthub; all the way is overflowed or _akalchex_. In the\r\nrainy season the road is very heavy. In this place we found the camp of\r\nthe Captain Don Joseph de Estenos, with all his people. It is a\r\npleasant place and has many orange and lemon trees. In it we saw a\r\nlarge enclosure which the Indians made to keep off the Spaniards, when\r\nthe latter went to despoil them fifteen years before. It has two large\r\n_aguadas_, one at the entrance of the said place, which in the dry\r\nseason is exhausted; with another large and round basin which God made\r\nin a living rock. Another _aguada_ lies in an easterly direction, a\r\ndistance of half a league, and the water here is permanent and deep. It\r\nbreeds very good fish of large size and tame, so that, although the\r\nsoldiers went in swimming, the fish did not flee away, so that they\r\ngave an opportunity to any one who had a _machete_ in his hand to kill\r\nthem. They call these fish crocodiles, because they are of the same\r\nshape and with the same scales as crocodiles, and they are very good\r\neating, according to the statement of all who eat them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBacechac. \"From this Nohthub we went five good leagues to a place which\r\nthey call Bacechac. In its center are three _aguadas_, but all were\r\ndry. There is much overflowed land or _akalchex_. There are very large\r\nforests with many copal and balsam trees, and many hills, on account of\r\nwhich the paths are impassable in the rainy season. This place has its\r\n_aguada_ in a westerly direction, and although it too held no water,\r\nnecessity made us experts, making deep holes in some parts of it, in\r\norder that the land should distil its moisture. So it happened, God\r\ngiving us sufficient water from night to morning in the said wells\r\nwhich we opened to relieve our need.\r\n\r\n\"We left this place the next day and traveled about two leagues by some\r\nplaces which are very much submerged and not the less dangerous, as\r\nmuch on account of the hills which surround them as from the chance\r\nstreams which are met there, until at last we reached a summit which\r\nforms on the top a great plain, in which is found an _aguada_ called\r\nCelmet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBuete. \"In this place the same thing happened to us (as far as water is\r\nconcerned) as in the preceding _aguada_. We left this place and\r\ntraveled some two leagues and a half to a place called Buete. In this\r\nplace we found twelve or thirteen houses of the heathen Indians, who\r\nhad just surrendered to the Indian soldiers of Sahcabchen, without any\r\nviolence, as I shall explain hereafter. This place has a very large\r\n_aguada_ with much eel-grass and very many _caimans_. In this town and\r\ntwo others near by we found ample supplies of maize, beans and the rest\r\nof the fruits on which all live in this land; and it came very\r\nopportunely, since already the army had no other recourse, after the\r\nhunger which they had endured for three days past....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLack of Supplies. \"It happened then that the captains found themselves\r\nin want of supplies, and that they wrote several letters to Captain Don\r\nJuan del Castillo about the transportation of some supplies which some\r\nmuleteers of the town of Teabo left in one of the aforementioned places\r\ncalled Tzucte, at a distance of eight leagues from Cauich, which\r\nsupplies I saw when I passed through it, as well as the letters which\r\nwere written about the despatch of provisions, and in spite of these\r\nletters or other special exertions in sending soldiers with mules from\r\nthe camp for the supplies, they effected nothing....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nParades Seizes Some Farms. \"Seeing then such a clear and extreme need.\r\nCaptain Alonso Garcia de Paredes, the head and leader of the other\r\ncaptains, determined to send Captain Pedro de Zubiaur, with some\r\nSpanish armed soldiers, following some confused rumors which an Indian\r\nnamed Juan Ake, who had guided them, had spoken of. He it is who\r\nmentioned these three _ranchos_ in my presence in the town of Cauich.\r\nAnd although it is true, that there he mentioned these _ranchos_, here\r\nhe appeared in doubt in speaking with the captains, showing himself to\r\nbe totally ignorant of such towns, he being the cause that these\r\nSpaniards lost themselves in those forests. But the soldiers, availing\r\nthemselves of their agility, climbed the trees and the hill-tops, from\r\nwhich they discovered a great smoke, and they went on in that\r\ndirection; and having come up to it, they saw that there were the\r\nsoldiers of the town of Zahcabchen, who, by order of Captain Alonso\r\nGarcia de Paredes, came out from another direction to the abandoned\r\ntown of Tzucthok, which the said Captain with these soldiers had\r\ndestroyed fifteen years since. Therefore he knowing beforehand of the\r\nsaid farms, gave orders that they should proceed to take possession of\r\nthem before the Spaniards whom he had brought with him should come up.\r\nThe Indians obeyed the orders of their Captain, and entered upon the\r\nfarms with great imprudence, shooting without any cause, and killing\r\ntill they had killed five Indians, without more reason than that of the\r\navarice which led them to inspire the owners with fear, so that they\r\nshould flee, as many did, in order to rob them safely of as much as\r\nthey possessed; as they did. And to me it is evident that they made a\r\nvery imprudent entry on to these farms.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFifty-one Indians of Buete Surrender. \"Notwithstanding this imprudence,\r\nfifty-one Indians delivered themselves up, with their wives and\r\nchildren. These were from the said town of Buete, besides those who had\r\nfled from Kantemo, and from the town of Yames, now today called the\r\ntown of the dead, from the five aforesaid having died there. Of these\r\nIndians who gave themselves up, two were left as guides and the rest,\r\nwith their wives and children, they took as prisoners to the said\r\nabandoned town of Tzucthok. The two guides who remained I treated\r\nkindly and with special attention, as the first fruit of our love, I\r\nmean, of our labors, and this they surely recognized, for from the love\r\nthey felt for me, they embraced me and asked me that I should be a\r\npetitioner for them to the Captain Alonso Garcia, so that he should\r\ntell his soldiers that they should return all the clothing and wax\r\nwhich they had collected; since they themselves had neither resisted\r\nnor defended themselves, but had on the other hand surrendered\r\nvoluntarily, when they might have run away and did not do so; but\r\ncalling out to the soldiers, they not only surrendered themselves, but\r\nacted as guides to the other towns, at the convenient hour of dawn, so\r\nthat they gathered them all in without any noise;--they call all these\r\nIndians who voluntarily surrendered, the Mayas.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAvendano Argues with Paredes about his Plundering. \"In compliance with\r\nthe request which the two pagan Indians made me, and having placed It\r\nbefore the Captain, I gained my point by giving him advice; telling him\r\nin my remarks that he should consider that in that first public act lay\r\nthe success of the rest, so that it was of great importance for him to\r\ncarry into effect the justice which the two pagan Indians asked for;\r\nand I asked this for many reasons, the first;--because it was the\r\nservice of God, law and reason and in conformity with the charity which\r\nwe ought to show towards our neighbors and with the good example which\r\nin the present case we ought to set.... The next reason is, if we show\r\nthem justice, it would follow, that, even if some of them fled, they\r\nwould proclaim the good deeds of the Spaniards, and the rest of the\r\npeople of the towns which we should come to in the future, would not\r\nrun away; and if they did not flee, they would serve with me as\r\nmessengers, so that through spreading the report of the good treatment\r\nwhich had been shown them, the other townspeoples would not refuse to\r\nsurrender.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Royal Decrees are Mentioned by Avendano. \"The last thing which I\r\nplaced before him was the large number of decrees which His Majesty\r\n(may God guard him) had despatched, and those which his predecessors of\r\neternal memory had despatched, which affirm the same thing which I\r\nasked him, as in the case of the first instructions, which were given\r\n(by the mandate of our Catholic King) to the Admiral Christopher\r\nColon....\r\n\r\n\"The same thing was urged afterwards by the same Catholic Kings,\r\nin the year 1501, upon the Commander, Nicolas de Ovando, when he went\r\nto govern the island of Santo Domingo, and this decree reads as\r\nfollows:--that he should arrange with great vigilance and care that all\r\nthe Indians of Espanola should be free from slavery, and that they\r\nshould not be molested by any one, but that they should live as free\r\nvassals, governed and guarded in justice and that they should arrange\r\nso that they be instructed in the holy Catholic faith; since his\r\nintention was that they should be treated with love and kindness,\r\nwithout permitting that any one should do them harm; so that they\r\nshould not be hindered in receiving our holy faith and so that they\r\nshould not hate the Christians for their deeds, etc.'\r\n\r\n\"And many other decrees were issued thereafter for the same purpose,\r\nthe same thing being repeated and urged by an infinite number of\r\ndecrees and ordinances of the Emperors, Charles V, Philip II and III\r\nand up to Philip IV....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nParedes Promises to Return the Plunder. \"All these reasons which I gave\r\nto the said Captain, Alonso Garcia de Paredes, struck him favorably and\r\nhe gave me his word to cooperate in my request, causing their clothes\r\nand the rest of the things which had been taken from them to be\r\nreturned to the Indian prisoners, promising at the same time to punish\r\nthe transgressors, as soon as he reached the said abandoned Tzucthok.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nParedes Fails to Keep his Word. \"And when he reached there, I reminded\r\nhim of the said promise, but as avarice drew him more than charity, he\r\nanswered me with scorn, saying, 'God be with you. Padre, how can you\r\nexpect me to know now who was the man who robbed the prisoners?' At\r\nthis time there came one of the offending soldiers to speak to him. He\r\nwas wearing loose breeches made of the clothing which they had stolen\r\nfrom the aforesaid Indians; and I, answering his rough suggestion, said\r\nto him:--'See, Senor Captain, that there is standing near you one who\r\nknows of or is the doer of the theft, since the breeches of this\r\nsoldier of yours show it.' He replied:--Padre, those are his\r\nperquisites, which I cannot take away.' And at the same time, turning\r\nhis back to me, he said to him:--'Take notice, man, that I hold you\r\nresponsible for paying for all the wax which you and the rest of you\r\nhold.' So that the special result of this trip can well be understood\r\nto be quite contrary to the service of God and of the King, and very\r\nuseful only to the special ends of the avarice of the soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"I, seeing this coldness, in the beginning, never supposed that the\r\nresults would be happy, so that I felt sad enough; since it would have\r\nbeen better not to have started out on such an enterprise, if I was to\r\nsee such inhumanities....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTzucthok, once before Reduced, had Rebelled. \"By our lengthened stay in\r\nthis aforesaid abandoned town of Tzucthok, we had an opportunity of\r\ngaining a better understanding of its ruins. This is a town,--one of\r\nthose which our Padre, Fray Christoval Sanchez, brought into obedience,\r\nthough afterwards the people became rebellious. Today the forked poles\r\nwhich his holiness placed in the church he built are still standing. It\r\nis a very pleasant place, although unhealthful on account of the\r\nlightness of the winds. The water is pure, but also of a hardness which\r\nmakes it excessively harmful. There are many cocoa-nut palm trees, many\r\nfruit trees, particularly lemons. Before reaching this place there is a\r\nlarge spring or river beneath the ground, so that for the distance of a\r\nleague, the path goes following its banks and the bed of the said\r\nriver. It is to be understood that in the rainy season it is full of\r\nwater. There is good hunting in the woods, especially peacocks and\r\npheasants. The most common animal in these woods is a leopard or false\r\nlion, with a red skin and with spots of various colors. The natives\r\ncall it _Chacekel_. Among the birds are some which are very different\r\nfrom those of the Province. I heard a little bird warble, which I knew\r\nat once was a linnet like those of Spain; it imitated it much in its\r\nsong as in its size, though not in its plumage. There is another bird\r\nwith a body of a hen of Castile, called _Pan_. Its beak is very long\r\nand thick; up to the middle it is yellow and the other half green; its\r\nfeathers correspond, being very yellow from below the beak to its\r\nbelly. The rest of the body is black, except under the tail, which has\r\na red plumage; the legs are green and in spite of so much beauty, it\r\nutters only shrieks....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Padres Endeavor to Instruct the Indians. \"In these affairs, besides\r\neducating those who had been lately gathered together, although they\r\nmight never be freed from slavery, we passed our time till the 24th of\r\nJuly, when we heard news that the road openers would shortly come to a\r\ncertain town of the nation of the Cehaches; and in order not to fail as\r\nin the previous case, we priests planned to speak plainly with the\r\ncaptains and to find out what their plan was to be on entering it; for\r\nif it was not more decent and Christian than in the past, we had\r\ndetermined to avoid the occasion of disturbance, by returning to the\r\nProvince, rather than see cruel deeds performed....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Captains Promise to Give Warning before Fighting. \"The captains\r\n... promised their assent to the advice which we might give them\r\nhereafter, adding that, when an opportunity offered to enter any town,\r\na proclamation should be issued, with a penalty of death on any one who\r\nshould dare to go against it....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA Skirmish. \"At this time the Indian road openers went on with their\r\nwork, bringing as their guard the Indian musketeers from Sahcabchen,\r\nwho never did anything well, owing to the said Captain Alonso, who, on\r\naccount of his interest in their spoils, sends them out by themselves,\r\nwithout any Spanish people of intelligence to oversee that their duties\r\nare performed in a proper way. While engaged in this, they discovered a\r\ntown of the Cehaches, Chunpich, already abandoned, as they had heard\r\nthe rumor of the Spaniards, on account of which they found in one house\r\nonly twenty-five loads of maize. Seeing many traces of people, they\r\nentered in fear, and notifying the said captain of their having\r\ndiscovered the said town, they all asked him for reinforcements, since\r\nthey feared a hard fight. He gave them the reinforcements they asked\r\nfor, together with their arms, though they did not arrive in time,\r\nsince before they arrived there came as many as twenty-five Indians\r\nwith their baskets for that maize which they had left. The soldiers,\r\nwell prepared, carried their arms for whatever might turn up, since\r\ngoing prepared with arms was always the cause of many victories as\r\nopposed to many defeats. On the other hand they do less harm, the\r\nbetter provided they are. So it happened to these men; since having\r\nposted six Indian musketeers as sentinels in the direction they\r\nsupposed the ruined town lay, so as to defend themselves and the\r\nworkmen on the road, until their reinforcements arrived, it happened\r\nthat the sentinels, seeing the said twenty-five Indians coming, they\r\nseemed to them to be thousands, and with the fear which never\r\naccomplished a good thing and with their evil disposition, which always\r\nhas done much harm, without letting them enter so as to direct their\r\nfire well, our men broke ranks, which not only gave our opponents a\r\nbetter chance to get ready for a battle, but also frightening more the\r\nrest of our men who became aware of the retreat, made them hastily and\r\nheedlessly attribute the victory to our enemies. At that time, the\r\nreinforcement of our men coming up, the timid sentinels, deserting\r\ntheir posts, came back to make part of the reinforcement which was\r\ncoming to them. When all were together they rushed to battle, which our\r\nopponents, like brave men, won finely, wounding three of our men\r\nwithout any of them being wounded. The remainder of our men fled and\r\nour opponents, laughing, left them and took their way with cries to\r\nthose forests by the path on which they all lived. Our men returned to\r\nfollow that path about four leagues; in that district they found two\r\ntowns without inhabitants, though they were well provided with farms\r\nwith all their products. These they ate and carried off as a token of\r\ntheir valor, giving as an excuse of their unfortunate fight, that their\r\nopponents were not men but demons, not endowed with reason, but brutes,\r\nsince, without fear of death, they flung themselves savagely on the\r\nguns.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Avarice of Paredes. \"All this happened to the Captain [Paredes]\r\nthrough avarice, for, on account of avarice, he did not wish to send\r\nrespectable and honorable Spaniards, who might obtain with good\r\njudgment victories in these engagements, but only his Indians from\r\nCahcabchen, so that by frightening the other Indians, they should enter\r\nsafely into the houses in order to steal as much as the poor Indians\r\nhave in their houses, as happened in the preceding case that I refer to\r\nabove. We all inferred that all this was with the permission of the\r\nsaid Captain, since, seeing the feelings, which we showed at his not\r\nhaving kept his promise to us, given at the conference which we had\r\nhad, not only did he not punish the transgressors, but neither did he\r\nmake amends for the casualties which might necessarily have happened,\r\nit being the fact that we suggested the remedy in both cases, and he\r\nappeased us with kind words....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nChunpich is Reached. \"After this unfortunate engagement the whole camp\r\nwent along to the said town of Chunpich, distant eight long leagues\r\nfrom this town of Tzucthok, and the Captains, addressing me, asked me\r\nto stay with my companions to look after those Indians and children,\r\nbesides some sick Indians, educating them and instructing them as I\r\nought; and if by chance they should find a town, they would notify me,\r\nso that I could come to catechize them. I accepted this proposal for\r\nthe future, carrying out his orders at the present time, and having\r\nknown that the said captains had passed forwards from the said village\r\nof Chunpich, I got ready to go alone with four Indian singers to the\r\nsaid town, and by inspecting or cutting down all their thickets, to see\r\nif I could meet with the Cehaches Indians who made war on the\r\nSpaniards, in order to draw them to the bosom of our Holy Mother\r\nChurch. I went through the said forests to a great distance, and in all\r\ndirections and I did not meet any one. At this time I received\r\ninformation (although it was confused) that, after the said town of\r\nChunpich was passed, on the road to the South which we were following\r\nin a Southeast direction, an indistinct foot path had been discovered.\r\nAs I knew that on the said route lay the nation of the Ytzaes, for\r\nmeeting whom I have been preparing for some years, by having learned\r\ntheir language, it was necessary to set about following the path which\r\nthe Spaniards were taking, in order to verify my suspicions; but it\r\nverified nothing but constant misfortunes; since on the path I met four\r\nIndian musketeers of the town of Sahcabchen, whom their captain was\r\nsending as slaves to the quiet of his house. They brought me a letter\r\nfrom the Captain, Don Joseph de Estenos, in which he told me that he\r\nhad found three other towns without inhabitants, though with some\r\nlittle rotten corn; and that the third leader, Don Pedro de Suviaur by\r\nname, had gone with his men to another town which they supposed\r\nbelonged to the Ytzaes. This letter reached me a league and a half from\r\nChunpich, at a very large _aguada_ which there is there, and at three\r\nlong leagues from there is another large abandoned town called Ixbam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nZuviaur Goes to the Itzas; the Padres Return. \"I returned unhappy when\r\nI thought of the little result which had come in the said town of\r\nChunpich, and I took pleasure in its suburbs to divert my sorrow, since\r\nthis place is very pleasant. A lake lies towards the West, so large\r\nthat it stretches out of sight. The water is very good, the two other\r\ntowns of which I spoke above being around the said lake. The Spaniards\r\nfound these at the time of the fight, all very full of fruits and\r\nabundant corn-fields, which the captain wished to have trampled down\r\nand destroyed so that their owners might come and give themselves up.\r\nBut we did not consent to this; I was taking great pleasure in looking\r\nat the said lake, when an Indian came whom I had sent to camp, with\r\nletters from the Governor, and besides confirming the news which the\r\nsaid Captain, Don Joseph, had written me, he stated to me that he had\r\nknown how the third leader Don Pedro de Zuviaur had gone to one of the\r\ntowns of the Ytzaes. I regretted this last more than the rest, since I\r\nwas holding the said towns reserved for the purpose of going to them\r\nwithout their hearing any rumors of soldiers.... I returned more sad\r\nthan I had been at first. I went to the town of Tzucthok, where my\r\ncompanion Padres were, looking after the management of those Indians\r\nwho had been allotted to me.... As I considered our work useless, since\r\nthey had depopulated eight towns of the Cehaches, without any results,\r\nto see also that they had reached the Ytzaes, whom also they were going\r\nto spoil was the cause of the greatest sorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther Troubles. \"I discussed with my companion Padres the troubles\r\nwhich followed,--now on account of the Indians, who were fleeing every\r\nday, now of the need which they had of supplies, now of the continual\r\nrains which caused these places to be overflowed, by which speedy ruin\r\nwas threatened, now of the injustice which the said captains showed\r\nus....\r\n\r\n\"Without giving me anything to do, nor allotting me Indians to\r\ncatechize and manage in the future, the said captain took away from me\r\nthose of whom I had charge, and whom I not only catechized but also\r\nbaptized and married, without paying attention to the despatch of his\r\nMajesty, which prohibits the changing of the residence of the Indians\r\nwho had recently been converted, on account of the risk of their lives\r\nwhich would follow; as Solorzano cites them and quotes them,--one of\r\nwhich says 'that too hard work should not be given them and they should\r\nnot be taken to distant places, and that above all their health and\r\npreservation should be looked after, without taking them to a sky,\r\nclimate or temperature which are different or contrary to those to\r\nwhich they are accustomed.' ...\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Padres Determine to Get to the Itzas Some Other Way. \"We then,\r\nseeing all these troubles and injustices, in order to avoid the contest\r\nand disturbances which could not be remedied, together with all the\r\ninconveniences, risks and dangers which in the time of so great rains,\r\neach day brought to us, determined to return to the Province, with the\r\nintention to send word about everything to our Very Reverend Padre\r\nProvincial from the first town of the Province and to take from there\r\nthe road in a different direction, which I knew of, so as to go without\r\nany noise of arms to the nation of the heathen Ytzaes, passing through\r\nthe nation of the Indians of Tipu. This is a direction opposite to that\r\nwhich the Spaniards took; so that we could obtain in this way something\r\nof our objects and end, which we always had before us, of going alone\r\nwithout soldiers or armed men, for the conversion of the said heathen,\r\nto which from the beginning we had dedicated ourselves....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter to the Captains. \"Agreeing then with my companions, the Padres,\r\nin this good suggestion, I wrote a letter to the captains, taking leave\r\nof them, without giving the reason why I returned, but stating that it\r\nwas on account of a slight accident that had happened to me; they, whom\r\ntheir consciences must have accused, supposing that I should set forth\r\nthere in this Province before the Governor, who had sent me, their\r\nimproper methods of acting, determined maliciously, for their greater\r\nsatisfaction, to justify themselves by forestalling, me, with charges\r\nagainst me, as if I should pay any attention to them....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor Ursua Vexed by the Captains' Letter. \"The Governor was vexed\r\nwith this letter which the Captain Alonso Garcia wrote to him, seeing\r\nthat he had chosen me to carry out his purpose, and then seeing that I\r\ngave him a slap in the face by returning without any reason, as they\r\nwrote him; for which reason he suspended judgment till he had news of\r\nmy coming to the Province, to inform himself of the truth. At this time\r\nwe arrived on our return, with hard work enough on account of so many\r\nwild thickets, as I spoke of in the beginning, and of all the\r\noverflowed lands, deep in water, since our return was made in the\r\nseason of heaviest rains, at the first town of the Province called\r\nHopelchen, whence I wrote to my Prelate of the resolution which we had\r\ntaken of returning to the Ytzaes by another route, since on the one we\r\nhad started on, our work was stopped. I received a reply from my\r\nPrelate by which he said he expected me in the City, without informing\r\nus that we should go back by the way we suggested.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn to Merida. \"We came to his presence and entered the City on\r\nSaturday the 16th of September of the said year 1695....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                  THE SECOND ENTRADA OF PADRE AVENDANO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first entrada being spoiled on account of trouble with the\r\nsoldiers, Avendano remained in the province until October 4, 1695. On\r\nthat day news reached him from a Spanish resident of Bacalar, called\r\nFrancisco de Ariza, that the nation of the Itzas, who numbered eighty\r\nthousand fighting men, had expressed their willingness to receive\r\nChristianity. This news pleased the Governor (Ursua) because the Itzas\r\nwere now the only obstacle that lay between him and the completion of\r\nthe Guatemala-Yucatan highway. Accordingly arrangements were concluded\r\naccording to the terms of which Avendano was once more to attempt to\r\nbring the Itzas to the Church. At his own wish he and his priests were\r\nto do this alone without the retarding influences arising from the\r\npresence of soldiers. Avendano asked for and received various letters\r\nand documents in which the policies he was to follow and the authority\r\nwith which he was invested were very fully set forth.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Orders of the Governor. One thing is particularly striking in\r\nconnection with all the conquests of the Spaniards in America, and that\r\nis the very divergent attitudes toward the natives assumed by the\r\nChurch and State on the one hand and by the soldiery and colonists on\r\nthe other. Nowhere does this difference come out more clearly than in\r\nthe matter of the entradas of Avendano. As that writer's report of the\r\npapers given to him by Governor Ursua just before he set out on his\r\nsecond trip is rather long, I will give an extract of it in order that\r\nthe reader may see just what was desired by the Padres and by the\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the Governor ordered that Avendano and his\r\ncompanions be given all necessary horses, Indians, and other equipment.\r\nHe also ordered Paredes, who had caused so much trouble before, to\r\nobserve carefully the wishes of His Majesty as expressed in the famous\r\ncedula of 1526. In that cedula it was urged that the Indians be turned\r\nfrom their evil ways; that any necessary houses, fortresses, and other\r\nbuildings be erected; that Christianity be introduced among the\r\nIndians; that colonization from Spain should be encouraged in a number\r\nof ways; and a number of other wise provisions were recommended.[9.1]\r\n\r\n\r\nDeparture of Avendano. We will allow Avendano (pp. 22v-29v, 49v-66r) to\r\ntell of the trip in his own words. \"With all these papers and the\r\nbenediction of my Prelate, I took my departure in the name of God from\r\nthis City of Merida on the 13th day of December of this year 1695, in\r\nthe company of my companion priests, who were the Padre Preacher, Fray\r\nAntonio Peres de San Roman, who also accompanied me in the first trip;\r\nthe Padre Preacher Fray Joseph de Jesus Maria, who from the other\r\nmission of the Reverend Padre Commissioner Fray Juan de Chaves (being\r\nhis Apostolic Notary) passed to my mission with the blessing and\r\nconsent of the Prelate Superior; and the Padre Preacher, Fray Diego de\r\nEchavarria, with a lay brother of the holy convent, all of whom united\r\nin the love of God and in charity burning to rescue the souls of those\r\ninfidel and heathen Ytzaes from the power of Satan in which, through\r\ntheir idolatry, they were plunged for so many centuries.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Same Route Followed as Before; Batcab is Reached. \"We went through\r\nthe same ways and places as the first time, till we came to a town of\r\nthe nation of the Cehaches, called Batcab, in which we met General\r\nAlonso Garcia de Paredes, with a captain called Don Pedro Zuviaur, an\r\nengineer or guide who was going in the direction in which they were\r\nopening the road from this province to that of Guatemala.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nChuntuci. \"The next day, which was that of the Holy Kings, on January\r\n6th of this year of '96, I said mass, which the army listened to; after\r\nwhich we started from the town for Chuntuci of the said nation of the\r\nCehaches, which is four leagues of very bad roads during the rainy\r\nseason, on account of the many overflowed and dangerous places that\r\nthere are in them in some parts which they call in this language\r\n_akalchees_ or _hulbalex_, and in Castilian _pantanos_. On the said\r\nroad likewise are found two rivers in the first league,--a small one\r\nwhich is not permanent except in the rainy season; as is the case with\r\nan _aguada_ which is found in the middle of the road on the slope of a\r\nridge which is ascended in times of rain with some difficulty, although\r\nthe other river, which is found about three leagues off, is permanent,\r\nthe water of which, though it is somewhat sluggish, for they say it is\r\na river of copper, nevertheless is very cool and raises very good fish,\r\nthough not very large ones. A league and a half from this river is the\r\nsaid town of Chuntuci, which consists of not more than eight houses\r\nclose together, though there are many others in the corn fields a\r\nlittle more or less distant, in a circuit of about half a league.\r\n\r\n\"We journeyed from this town of Chuntuci in a southerly direction a\r\ndistance of a good league, where there is a great overflowed space or\r\n_aguada_, which in this tongue is called _nohcib_, in the midst of\r\nwhich is discovered a great _aguada_, which without doubt is the origin\r\nor cause of some great river of those which flow to the Laguna de\r\nTerminos. At half a league beyond this we came across a little crystal\r\nstream, which left us in the belief that it had its origin from a great\r\nswamp near there towards the East, which is dimly seen on the other\r\nside of this little stream. About six quarters of a league from here,\r\nwe discovered an indistinct little path in the direction of the\r\nSouth-east, following which without suspicion, though we were armed, we\r\nrushed forward with eager confidence, following the path through the\r\nthickets without fearing any shipwreck, saying the prayer '_in exitu\r\nIsrael de Egiptu_' that we may imitate in their victory the Israelites,\r\nwho succeeded in passing through the waves of the Red Sea. We followed\r\nthe said path for some distance, during which we fell in with the\r\n_Batchee_, or signs which assured us that we were on the path to the\r\nnation of the heathen Ytzaes. So indistinct was the path in itself,\r\nthat to tell whether or not it was a path, required that _Batchee_,\r\nwhich was what we followed. After half a league of this road, we came\r\nacross a little stream. It is called Chinchinucum, in the language of\r\nthe Cehaches. Two leagues from there we found another larger stream,\r\ncalled Nohucum; at half a league farther on, a great _aguada_ called\r\nAkalcay. Two leagues and a half on the right is found a great pond,\r\ncalled Yavilain; another two leagues and a half from there is an\r\n_aguada_ called Chuncopo. This is an accidental _aguada_ in the middle\r\nof the road, which has abundance of water in the rainy season, from its\r\nbeing in the midst of low hills and _akalchees_. Beyond this place is a\r\ngreat ravine, which in this language is called _nohem_. It is about a\r\nleague and a half [long]. This ravine they call the 'Hell of the\r\nYtzaes' from the danger of its descent, on account of its being\r\nnecessary that the road should go through it, though we passed many\r\nothers which are more dangerous and worse than this ravine. On account\r\nof the impossibility of the passage which they had described to us, it\r\nbeing necessary to pass through it, so as to carry out our special\r\nundertaking and in order to accomplish it the better and to facilitate\r\nthe passage, we chose as its patron Saint our Padre San Antonio of\r\nPadua, by whose intercession, without doubt, the passage of the said\r\nravine became much easier for us than they had described to us up to\r\nthis time; we did not fail to pass over some hard hills and rough\r\nroads, but from here they were the worst of all I had seen up to this\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hardships of the Journey. \"Two leagues from this ravine we began to\r\nhesitate about the road, because we met with a large river, although it\r\nwas then dry; but in the rainy season, it is plainly seen, it carries a\r\ngreat mass of water. On account of this we found a variety of passages\r\nand _Batchees_, but, thanks to God and good fortune, in the courses of\r\nthis dry river, which is called Cohucum, we recognized some mud or\r\nsigns of earth among its pebbles, so that by following this sign for a\r\nlong distance, we not only came across, in a bend of the river, a\r\nspring of water, to satisfy our need of drinking which we already felt,\r\nbut also we recognized on its banks the _Batchee_ and the lost path, so\r\nthat at one time we had two consolations. We slept there, though it was\r\nvery early when we reached there, for fear of the scarcity of water,\r\nwhich we had already experienced. But in the morning we had occasion in\r\na short time to be vexed at so much water, since at a short distance we\r\nfell in with a stream more annoying than if it had been filled with\r\nwater, though the water which it carried was sufficient to drench us,\r\nsince we were not able to pass over it in all cases without going\r\nthrough it. One has to cross this river in the space of a league very\r\nnearly fifty times, so that it not only annoyed us by wetting us so\r\nmuch more, but because at each turn we lost the track or footprints\r\nwhich we were following; so that we were delayed enough in passing the\r\nsaid turns of the river.\r\n\r\n\"After a great storm they say fair weather follows, but the contrary\r\nhappened to us, since, trusting in the abundance of water, we neither\r\ndrank, since it was in the morning, nor did we carry it with us,\r\nsupposing that we should find it at each step, but what happened\r\nto us was to meet with a great multitude of very rough ascents and\r\ndescents,--all hills and very high mountains of limestone, which\r\nextended over a space of four leagues, so that, besides the path in\r\nitself being so rough, thirst was troublesome enough. We found\r\nourselves in the midst of this anguish when of a sudden we came on a\r\ndescent as rough and steep as it was long and dangerous; for, though we\r\nhad no load to carry, we had to make use of the trees so as not to\r\nslip, since if we slipped, there was no place to stop till we reached\r\nthe bottom, where we saw a horrible lime cavern which we supposed would\r\nhold water. But it was not so.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nApproaching the Itzas. \"From the top then of this hill, which I speak\r\nof, there was discovered a great range of low hills, of such a kind\r\nthat it not only appeared another country, since even from the top of\r\nthe trees we did not discover the land beyond or the part on the other\r\nside of this height. We thought that we doubtless were in another new\r\nterritory and near the Ytza nation, to which we were going. At a\r\ndistance of half a league from this descent, we came across a great\r\nspring of water, which was able with its force to turn many mills, and\r\nhowsoever great the pleasure was which we felt at seeing it, just as\r\nmuch disgust did the taste of it cause us, since it sprang from the\r\nbrow of a very high hill or steep rock, but it was all mixed with lime,\r\nand was of a lead and sulphur color, and like this also was its weight\r\nand taste. But we did not refrain from drinking it on this account,\r\nsince thirst appeared to us of worse taste and weight, although of\r\nlittle advantage was it to us, since in a short time after we\r\nexperienced that weight and bad taste, and the fatigue of the road\r\nwhich we traveled, we came in about a league upon a great pond, where\r\nwe camped for sleeping that night, since we had found there such good\r\naccommodation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTan Xuluc Mul; Temples on a Great Height. \"Having come then to this\r\npond of Tan xuluc mul an hour before sunset, we had to observe and\r\nwonder with pleasure and delight, since the water which we found was\r\nvery fine and good. We found the hut already made, since undoubtedly\r\nthe Ytzaes kept up that place either for occupation from time to time\r\nor as a permanent dwelling, for there are very many of them in those\r\nplaces. We had to observe and wonder on some rocks or buildings on some\r\nhigh places,--so high that they were almost lost to sight. And when we\r\ncaught sight of them clearly, the sun shining on them in full, we took\r\npleasure in seeing them; and we wondered at their height, since without\r\nany exaggeration it seemed impossible that that work could have been\r\ndone by hand, unless it was with the aid of the devil, whom they say\r\nthey adore there in the form of a noted idol. We, with great zeal which\r\naided us, determined to go up and break it; and, as for me, most of\r\nthose who know me know that the lightness of my feet corresponds to the\r\npassion of my zeal to destroy it. But I did not find a trail by which\r\nthe idolaters go up, and, even if I had found it, the ascent was always\r\ndifficult for me on account of the great height on all sides.\r\n\r\n\"This ridge continued along the way we traveled for a distance of five\r\nleagues, with very dangerous ascents and descents.... With these\r\ndifficulties we came across, at the end of five leagues, a large\r\n_peten_ of water, by which we unexpectedly found ourselves surrounded;\r\nand though we were pleased with the water, our pleasure was drowned in\r\nthe inconvenience of the place for sleeping....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nChakan Itza. \"This _aguada_ or _peten_ is called Ychmuxan, from which\r\nto the Chakan Ytza, there are three leagues, most of them consisting of\r\nvery low woods or underbrush, since the whole is mixed up, so that\r\nneither are they _Akalchees_ nor do they cease being so. These are\r\ngreat overflowed tracts, impossible to be walked on in the rainy season\r\nand even in dry times. He alone may walk there, who should wish to\r\nexpiate thoroughly his sins, but for any other purpose only a desperate\r\nman would do so, since such woods as those are of the kind which they\r\ncall _tocolchees_,--that is a labyrinth or confusion or hodge-podge of\r\nall weeds or thorny plants, so that I do not know how we brought our\r\nclothes and legs out from amongst them. All these sorrows and\r\nsufferings were signs of the pleasure which we were to receive on that\r\nday. In all the said three leagues there is found at each step a stream\r\nof moderate volume, though there is no passage, except, when following\r\nits banks, one can meet with the Chakan Ytzaes, as we did, about three\r\no'clock in the afternoon of the evening before the day of the name of\r\nJesus, which my holy religion celebrates on the 13th of January....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chakan Itzas. \"To cross to the other side of the river, which is\r\ncalled Caclemacal, and to reach the first settlement of the Chacan\r\nYtzaes was one and the same thing; at which, putting behind us and\r\nforgetting all our preceding difficulties, our hearts considered\r\nthemselves satisfied and well repaid with the delight and spiritual\r\nconsolation which we received at seeing ourselves at the entrance of\r\nthe mine where we were to meet with the precious or polished stone,\r\nwhich was to be either the glorious ornament of our crown, if we were\r\nworthy of dying for the faith which, with the help of God, we were\r\ngoing to plant, or the fruitful result of those laborious steps which,\r\nwith the said aid of heaven, we intended to bring about....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment of the Natives. \"We entered then this first settlement\r\nsituated on the opposite side of the river of Caclemacal about four\r\nquarters of a league away. In the middle of which we met an Indian\r\nwoman, wife of the brother of the cacique Ahcan, a near relative of the\r\npetty King of Peten Ytza, who, with two of her small children, was\r\ncoming to the said river for water; but when they saw us at a\r\ndistance,--three priests clothed with our priestly garments, which had\r\nnever been seen by them, and the four Indian singers who were traveling\r\nwith us, with the garb of the cloaks or _ayates_ which they wore, very\r\ndifferent from their own garments and from those of the three Cehaches\r\nIndians, whom we took along as guides, they ran away excitedly,--mother\r\nand children,--as if we might kill them, so that it was no little work\r\nthat we had to pacify them with gentle words and loving caresses,\r\nthough we had more trouble in quieting the minds of the brother-in-law,\r\nthe cacique and the other Indian authorities, who in a moment ran\r\ntogether at their cries, all with the intention of making war on us,\r\nfor they all came with bows and arrows in their hands.\r\n\r\n\"But as we wished to sow in their hardened hearts the pure grain of\r\nevangelical seed which should have a more fruitful growth than that\r\nwhich fell among the thistles and thorns, we began as genuine workmen\r\nof Christ to till the soil of their hearts with the loving hoe of\r\ncaresses, embracing them joyfully, as one who had fallen in with the\r\newe which had been lost for so many centuries, (the influence of our\r\nsoft words and the moderation of our prudent acts, resisting all the\r\nweight of their immoderate acts) at which most people were frightened;\r\nand we gave them at the same time some of the Spanish things which we\r\ncarried, as necessary and required for attracting their unruly spirits,\r\nfor this calmed and quieted them more than the caresses which we had\r\ngiven them. This entry into the said settlement or village was on the\r\n13th of January, on which my seraphic religion celebrates the vespers\r\nof the holy name of Jesus, and at the very hour of vespers....\r\n\r\n\"With their spirits now peaceful and happy, they entertained us on that\r\nafternoon and night, with such a confusion of shouts and outcries in\r\ntheir songs, that, had we not considered that those extravagant signs\r\nof joy were the wild ways of those rural hills and the fashion with\r\nthem, our hearts would have suffered some anxiety and sadness, the more\r\nso when we saw before us, those carved, striped and painted faces, made\r\nin the very likeness of the devil.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Padres Please Other Indians by Means of Little Gifts. \"I gave them,\r\nas they came up to the novel sight, some necklaces and other trinkets\r\nand trifles for their wives and daughters, and for the men some knives,\r\nfor the desire to possess which all came again, thus obliging me to\r\ngive them presents a second time, all which I did with pleasure, one\r\nreason being the abundance of what our benefactors in their kind zeal\r\nhad given me, and the other in order to draw them to our Catholic\r\nfaith, which comes to them more through the eye than through the\r\nhearing, since they are covetous in the extreme. They approached me to\r\nget what I had remaining in some hampers, in which I carried for the\r\npetty King an entire suit of clothes, in the fashion of the Indians of\r\nthis Province, which the Governor gave me, and other things which I was\r\ncarrying for the chiefs of Peten Ytza, in order the better to gain\r\ntheir good will, besides other things necessary for our ministry and\r\nsupport. And they made a request of me to let them see these things,\r\ncarried away by their gross inquisitiveness as much as by their\r\nexcessive covetousness. And scarcely did I yield and show them what I\r\nhad in the said hampers, when, with an insatiable desire they began to\r\ncovet all, the act of touching and the desire to take everything\r\nbecoming uppermost with them, rather than the modest civility of asking\r\nfor it....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Padres Renew their March. \"With great demonstrations of love they\r\nloaded themselves with all our goods and supplies (except the sacred\r\nrobes, since we did not bring them till we knew that the outcome was\r\nsafe) without giving an opportunity to any of the singers whom we had\r\nbrought with us to carry anything. With this accompanying we set out on\r\nthe road which leads in the direction of the East, for Peten Ytza,\r\nwhich is about five leagues off, all the Indians who lived round Cha\r\nKan Ytza accompanying us with their wives and children, giving shouts\r\nof joy in order to excite the rest to accompany us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNich. \"We went on in this manner to the landing place of the lake where\r\none enters the said Peten Ytza, on the shore of which is found a little\r\ntown called Nich, which consists of about ten houses. In one of them I\r\nsaw an Indian, the oldest one I had seen up to that time in the nation\r\nof the Cehaches, nor up to the present time in that of the Ytzaes,\r\nsince they have the custom of beheading them when they pass fifty\r\nyears, so that they shall not learn to be wizards and to kill; except\r\nthe priests of their idols, for whom they have great respect. And this\r\nman must have been one without doubt.\r\n\r\n\"In the region of the said road, there are many hills and great density\r\nof woods on the hills, many cedar and mahogany trees, which in this\r\ntongue are called _punabes_, besides many others which I do not mention\r\nso as to avoid annoyance. There are many overflowed places called\r\n_Akalchees_; there are also three rivers, one of moderate size, which\r\nfrom its falling from a high rock, makes noise enough; the other two,\r\nalthough they too fall from a rather high place, are not so full of\r\nwater, though they wet us all because their streams are wide and\r\nbecause there is no bridge to cross them. We came then to the said\r\ntown, Nich, whose cacique is called Ahtul, and this little town is the\r\nchief town of Cha Kan Ytza, which consists of other very small towns,\r\nbut of many settlements, and each of these possesses a cacique or\r\ncaptain, although all the Cha Kan Ytzaes, with their wives and\r\nchildren, as far as I saw, will be about six hundred souls, more or\r\nless.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIndians Arrive from Tayasal. \"We ate very heartily in the said town,\r\nfor the sake of giving them pleasure, so that they showed that they\r\nwere pleased and they entertained us with their instruments from twelve\r\no'clock of the day that we arrived till two o'clock in the afternoon,\r\nwhen, in answer to the previous messenger which I sent to the petty\r\nKing of my coming to his territory, there came up some eighty canoes,\r\nfull of Indians, painted and dressed for war, with very large quivers\r\nof arrows, though all were left in the canoes,--all the canoes\r\nescorting and accompanying the petty King, who with about five hundred\r\nIndians came forward to receive us. They hurried us on board with great\r\nspeed and with very rude actions, without taking notice of the music of\r\nthe clarions with which we awaited him, nor of the peace, which as its\r\nmessengers I brought him in the name of the King, our Lord. Nor on our\r\npart, could we fulfill our embassy, since, without giving us an\r\nopportunity to do so, they began suddenly to take us across the lake\r\n(which in that part probably is three leagues in distance across).[9.2]\r\nIn a small bay on its shore, a nephew of the King, whom I had rewarded\r\nwith some Spanish trinkets, coveting the image of a Santo Christo,\r\nwhich I wore on my neck, and which I had refused to give him on two\r\noccasions when he had asked me for it, on my giving a cutlass with its\r\nblade to the petty King, his uncle, seized the hand of his uncle with\r\nexcessive insolence, and snatching the blade from its sheath, turned it\r\nto my breast, and passing the blade across my throat, cut the string\r\nwith one blow and took the image of Christ from me. I reproached him\r\nfor his improper act and what he said to me was, 'Well, if you have not\r\nwished to give it to me, what am I to do?', by which it is plainly seen\r\nthat if one does not give them what they see and ask for, the life of\r\nhim who should refuse it is at risk from moment to moment. On seeing\r\nthis the King, his uncle, laughed at it, instead of reproving him, and\r\nhe began with more vanity and pride than a Lucifer, to say to me many\r\nthings very foreign to that first meeting. By this insulting and hasty\r\nreception, they did not give us an opportunity to look after our\r\nbaggage, although the Chakan Ytzaes had the opportunity to put our\r\nthings under such good guard that up to now we had not seen it, we\r\nbeing left from that time without more comfort than the clothes on our\r\nbacks, nor more sustenance than that which their savage generosity\r\nmight choose to give us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBravery of Avendano. \"In the long time that we were on the lake, a\r\ntemptation was offered to the King, such as belonged to the devil who\r\ninspired it and natural to his inhuman and cruel heart, so as to\r\ninspire me with fear, so that my heart might suffer some sadness or\r\ndisturbance; but his purpose found itself frustrated, first, because\r\nwhen I started from Merida for this nation, I went prepared to die; and\r\nsecond, knowing that they were such savages in their ways, my courage\r\nstood prepared to suffer whatever insults they might say to me, as for\r\ninstance to bear for God, who gives us courage, any unreasonable acts,\r\nwhatsoever. Suddenly the said King placed his hand over my heart to see\r\nif it was at all agitated, and at the same time he asked me if I was\r\nso. I who was before very glad to see that my wishes and the work of my\r\njourney were being obtained, replied to him, 'Why should my heart be\r\ndisturbed? Rather it is very contented, seeing that I am the fortunate\r\nman, who is fulfilling your own prophecies, by which you are to become\r\nChristians; and this benefit will come to you by means of some bearded\r\nmen from the East; who by signs of their prophets,[9.3] were we\r\nourselves, because we came many leagues from the direction of the east,\r\nploughing the seas, with no other purpose than, borne by our love of\r\ntheir souls, to bring them, (at the cost of much work) to that favor\r\nwhich the true God shows them.' I at this time, with some freedom on my\r\npart, also placed my hand on his breast and heart, and asking him also\r\nif his was disturbed, he said, 'No.' To which I replied, 'If you are\r\nnot disturbed, at seeing me, who am the minister of the true God,\r\ndifferent in everything from you, in dress, customs and color, so that\r\nI inspire fear in the devil, and if your heart is not troubled, why\r\nshould you expect me to be afraid of you, mere men like myself, whom I\r\ncome to seek purposely, with great pleasure, merely for the love which\r\nI have for their souls, and having found them, in order to announce to\r\nthem the law of the true God, as you shall hear when we come to Peten.'\r\nAt this, changing the conversation, the devil tried to use him as his\r\ninstrument for putting me in another greater temptation.\r\n\r\n\"It is a custom among them, that, on the day before killing any one or\r\nsacrificing him, especially if he is a stranger to their town, to give\r\nthem something to eat, either the hot drink of barley and beans, which\r\nthey use, or another of _cacao_, which is what they offer them. I was\r\nnot ignorant of all these rites, through what history relates that they\r\nhad done on the two occasions on which priests of my holy religion had\r\ngone there; although in one case did they kill the Padre Fray Diego\r\nDelgado, through the fault of some Spaniards who followed him. When in\r\nthe same way the said King asked me if I was hungry, I, though I had\r\njust eaten, realizing the situation, said 'Yes,' so that his wickedness\r\nshould not see any cowardice in me; and I asked him if they had\r\nanything to eat, that they should give me some. At once he ordered that\r\nall the canoes should halt, and made them give red peppers and herbs,\r\nor _tamales_, which they brought on purpose to give us in the middle of\r\nthat lake. I ate it eagerly and asked him very pleasantly if there was\r\nany more; to which he replied, 'Then it has tasted good to you?'\r\n'Finely,' I told him, 'and I would eat more if there were any.' I said\r\nthis to him with some wit, at which they all laughed, but in a serious\r\nway, and they gave another which I ate with the same pleasure, at which\r\nthey were all surprised,--at the sight of my coolness....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Landing at Tayasal; the Idol. \"With this we continued our way to\r\nPeten Ytza, which is situated in the middle of the said lake, as well\r\nas in the midst also of other islands or _Petens_. On the shore of the\r\nlanding place is situated the house of the said petty King at the\r\ndistance of half a quarter of a league, in the middle of which, open to\r\nthe street, stands the fragment of a column, of round stone, the\r\ncircumference of each part of which is about three quarters of a yard\r\nacross and one quarter high. It is made of stones placed on top of each\r\nother with mortar of lime and _cah cab_, which is usually used for that\r\npurpose; and the middle is filled in with bitumen, so that it is like a\r\ntable, with a round pedestal, upon which and set in the foundation of\r\nthe said stone column, there stands out toward the West a stone mask,\r\nvery ill-formed, which, together with the stone column, the petty King\r\nand the rest of his family and followers worship. The said column is\r\ncalled, in the name by which they worship it, Yax cheel cab, which\r\nmeans in their language, 'the first tree in the world,' and, as is\r\nunderstood in their old songs (which few people understand) they wish\r\nto have it known they worship it because it was the tree of whose fruit\r\nour first father Adam ate, who in their language is called Ixanom. In\r\nthe small part which is fortunately preserved, and the mask, which\r\nstands in the said foundation of the said column, they worship him with\r\nthe title of the son of the very wise God. In their language they call\r\nhim Ahcocahmut....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Temple. \"We came to the said temple which had more space than\r\nthe hall of the petty King, although it is the same in its structure.\r\nHere we dimly saw a box suspended,[9.4] in which we saw indistinctly\r\n(although hastily) a bone of the leg or thigh, very large in size,\r\nwhich appeared to be that of a horse; and I confess that though we had\r\nmuch to do that afternoon, which was the time that we stayed in that\r\ntemple, we acted a little unwisely, since we neither asked what that\r\nbone was, nor did we remember in the rest of the days to go and look at\r\nit more deliberately. This thought occurred to us when we had left\r\nPeten, when our error was irremediable (which was a cause of greater\r\ngrief) because we remembered then that that bone was by chance from the\r\nhorse which Cortes left in their care, which they had kept as a relic\r\nor to hold him in memory, since they rendered worship (as I said\r\nbefore) to his statue.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Padres Read the Letters. \"At last I brought out the letters of the\r\nmessage and it cost no little trouble to make them sit down and keep\r\nquiet, so that they might hear it. I called before us all the priests,\r\nwho are the Masters of the law, and all the caciques, captains and\r\nchiefs of all the districts of that island or _Peten_.... I began to\r\nread to them the message which the Governor sent in writing in the name\r\nof the King our Lord; and in the few moments that I had read to them,\r\nseeing their manner and the little attention which they showed, I\r\nperceived that they did not understand what I was reading to them, and\r\nhaving asked them about this, they replied in the words, '_manucan a\r\ncan tucot kanil caxicin_,' which means, 'we do not understand what you\r\nsay.' Then, leaving off reading the letter, ... I explained the said\r\nmessage to them in the ancient idiom, and inserting a spiritual sermon\r\n... and all this was explained to them with some eagerness, mixing in\r\nsome words of their prophecies, which were at that time to the point.\r\nThey heard it gladly, because they understood it all.... They answered\r\nin these words, '_cato vale_,' which is as if they said 'We will think\r\nof it first, for there is time for answering. Wait.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Curiosity of the Itzas. \"With this, as it was already almost\r\nnight-fall, we set out with the same crowd for another temple, which\r\nstands about three-eighths of a league from the house of the petty\r\nKing, where was our abode. Although we stopped there, the continuation\r\nof their wonderment did not stop on their part, since, with this as an\r\nexcuse, they did not leave us a moment alone by day or night, since if\r\nany, satisfied with having seen us by day, went away to their houses at\r\nnight, double the number of them came by night to see us and to sleep\r\nthere, besides those who came first, and even those who had gone away\r\nsatisfied with seeing us, did not fail to come back. In this way we\r\nlived with the annoyance which can be imagined, since we were not able\r\nto attend to our needs, without their following us; and neither the\r\nprohibition of the King nor our own scolding were sufficient to hinder\r\ntheir excessive curiosity, the only attention which they paid to either\r\nbeing that they all laughed at it. Their tediousness was such, that if\r\nwe sat down, they all sat down next to us, surrounding us; and then\r\nsome on one side and others on the other would touch us from top to\r\ntoe, not excepting (if we gave them the chance) the most hidden parts\r\nof a man; if we stopped or walked on, it was all the same, so that, in\r\norder to be able to carry on the divine service without that annoyance,\r\nwe contrived the plan that they should seat themselves in a row around\r\nthe said temple on the benches of stone and lime which were there, and\r\nwe, walking up and down in the middle, carried on the divine service,\r\nit all being a matter of amusement for them,--not only the movement of\r\nour lips speaking things they did not understand, but also the gestures\r\nand crosses which we made over ourselves as we prayed; and, although we\r\ngot through with our prayers, we kept walking all the while so as to\r\nenjoy the relief for so much longer time.\r\n\r\n\"The King was present at all this, since he never left us by day or\r\nnight.... I asked them what it was that they had decided to reply to my\r\nmessage. At which the King, taking the lead, answered, for all, in the\r\nsame words as above, '_Cato cato vale_.' 'We will answer soon.' And the\r\nKing, speaking aside with me, asked what it was I wished to hear; to\r\nwhich I replied, 'to know if you wish to receive the law of God and the\r\nfriendship of the Spaniards which I offered you yesterday, and if you\r\nwish to undertake to be Christians, as has been prophesied to you by\r\nyour prophets, since you are not ignorant of them. The time has come.'\r\nTo which the King, together with the two other priests who were with\r\nhim, replied to me that they were willing to become Christians, but\r\nthat they did not know how that kind of baptism which I had explained\r\nto them was to be carried out. Then I, taking as a text that verse of\r\nEzekiel, 'I will sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean;\r\nfrom all your iniquities and your idols will I cleanse you,' explained\r\nthe said text to them, item by item.... They replied to this in these\r\nwords,--'_ba valac a toca vale_,' which means 'so it will be when\r\ntomorrow dawns and we shall see it.' With this we all went to the\r\ntemple, where we stopped and where they were present all night. Before\r\nGod brought the dawn, they had already caused to be brought some cups\r\nof warm _posole_, which they are accustomed to drink, so that with this\r\nand the rest of the supplies which they use, such as ..., beans, cooked\r\nsquashes, flesh of wild pigs, prawns and other kinds of fish, with\r\nwhatever each man found in his house, and all this with many tortillas\r\nof maize bread, and they did not stop bringing these till night; there\r\nbeing an excess of everything, so that when we saw that these same\r\npeople did not depart from here, we gave it back again to them to eat,\r\nwhich they did, the King beginning first.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA Baptism Performed. \"Having breakfasted this first day on warm\r\n_posole_, we began for the third time to speak about the spiritual\r\nlecture of the day before, ... and having heard for the third time this\r\nlecture, anxious to receive the said baptism, although suspicious of\r\nwhat it was, since they thought that there was some shedding of blood\r\nor circumcision or cutting of some part of their body, they said that\r\nthey wished to see in one case how that was done, and at this time the\r\nKing, taking hold of one child of the many of his family which he had\r\nconcealed behind the temple for the said purpose, said to me,--'Do that\r\nwhich you speak of to this child and I will see whether it is good or\r\nnot.' To which I replied,--'And if it should seem to be good, will you\r\npermit me to do just the same with the rest of your children?' To which\r\nthe King replied, before all the people who stood around listening,\r\nthat he would. Then taking the child which the King offered me, and one\r\nof the Indian singers who went with us holding him, I sprinkled on him\r\nthe baptismal water. Then, seeing that this was such an easy thing and\r\nwithout the harm which they had expected, they asked me to do the same\r\nwith the children which the King had concealed there. These he\r\nimmediately brought forth, and he bade all those present (especially\r\nthose of his family and district) to bring their little children to\r\nreceive their names (for this is what they called baptism). And he told\r\nthe priests who were present there, about three or four in number,--'It\r\nis proper that all your children should come to receive their names and\r\nto be washed.' With this example of the King in being the first to\r\nbring his children to be baptized, the other Indians imitated him in\r\nbringing theirs in great haste, so that in the three days and a half\r\nduring which they delayed in giving their answer to my message, I\r\nperformed very nearly three hundred baptisms, without my having an\r\nopportunity to stir from that temple, on account of my seeing the\r\nassemblage of Indian men and women, who brought their children of their\r\nown accord to be baptized. I gladly administered the said holy rite,\r\nsince the King, (who in everything showed himself very friendly towards\r\nme) and three other priests who were his relatives had told me that\r\nthey were only waiting for two caciques with their captains, in order\r\nto give the final answer, which would be favorable in all respects (as\r\nthey did give it) and this will be seen below....\r\n\r\n\"I stopped baptizing until I could catechize them in the mysteries of\r\nour holy faith, which is required for such a purpose; and afterwards\r\nall agreed with me to receive baptism when I should come back there at\r\nthe appointed time of four months hence, as I will speak of in the\r\nproper place.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Caciques Arrive. \"I found myself occupied in this work, when, on\r\nthe said day, there began to come, sailing over the lake, some of the\r\ngovernors' captains and head men of the four other _Petens_ or islands,\r\nwith their officers of war, and their paraphernalia, such as javelins\r\nand their flint daggers, a little less than a quarter of a yard\r\nlong,--the said javelins adorned with feathers of various colors\r\ninstead of with ribbons, very beautiful to see, and all hanging down. I\r\nwent forth to receive them, out of the courtesy which is due from me,\r\nbut the Indians of that _Peten_ went out stirred merely with curiosity\r\nto see them come, painted red and covered with feathers, with their war\r\ntrappings and their faces painted black. I embraced them and spoke to\r\nthem in kind words, and if I found that I had anything left to eat, of\r\nwhat they gave me there, I shared it with them, as they had just come,\r\nmaking them sit down next to me and the King, who always remained at my\r\nside. As the result of my action, if they had any misgiving, they cast\r\nit aside, or if they felt any anger or dissatisfaction on seeing me\r\nthere, they became calm, and at once I set forth my proposal, which\r\nthey accepted and received well, which proposal was that they should be\r\nfriends of the Spaniards and should receive their laws, in proof of\r\nwhich acceptance they bowed their heads, saying that they wish the\r\ntrade in hatchets and machetes which they should receive from them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Caciques in War Paint. \"Among these caciques or governors of the\r\nsaid four islands, there came an old man with a moderate sized\r\n_machete_ with two edges, forming the blade of his javelin; and\r\nanother, not so old, with his flint dagger; and these, besides coming\r\npainted and in warlike array, had their faces as foul as the purpose\r\nwhich they had in their hearts was wicked (as they promptly showed).\r\nLooking at them naturally inspired horror. I did my best to treat them\r\nmore kindly, speaking to them more frequently and pleasantly,\r\ndiscoursing with them in their ancient idiom, as if the time had\r\nalready come (just as their prophets had foretold) for our eating\r\ntogether from one plate and drinking from one cup, we, the Spaniards,\r\nmaking ourselves one with them. To this the older one replied, with an\r\naffected laugh, that he was very happy at this, so as to go from these\r\nthickets in which he lived and to come with me to the Province and\r\nobtain titles to lands which his ancestors held and to live on these in\r\nhappiness among his elder brothers, the Spaniards; promising me at the\r\nsame time to accompany me with all his people into the presence of the\r\nGovernor as a proof of a true surrender. His showing without necessity\r\nsuch submission was a sure sign of his real treachery. It was now about\r\nfour o'clock in the afternoon without their having had speech with the\r\nKing, at which they went at once to the house of a friend of theirs,\r\nand I saw that the King took little account of them, and it was\r\nbecause, as I knew afterwards from the mouth of the King, they were his\r\nenemies....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAvendano Makes Inquiries as to their Manner of Reckoning Time. \"I told\r\nthem that I wished to speak to them of the old manner of reckoning\r\nwhich they use, both of days, months and years and of the ages, and to\r\nfind out what age the present one might be (since for them one age\r\nconsists only of twenty years) and what prophecy there was about the\r\nsaid year and age; for it is all recorded in certain books of a quarter\r\nof a yard high and about five fingers broad, made of the bark of trees,\r\nfolded from one side to the other like screens; each leaf of the\r\nthickness of a Mexican _Real_ of eight. These are painted on both sides\r\nwith a variety of figures and characters (of the same kind as the\r\nMexican Indians also used in their old times), which show not only the\r\ncount of the said days, months and years, but also the ages and\r\nprophecies which their idols and images announced to them, or, to speak\r\nmore accurately, the devil by means of the worship which they pay to\r\nhim in the form of some stones. These ages are thirteen in number; each\r\nage has its separate idol and its priest, with a separate prophecy of\r\nits events. These thirteen ages are divided into thirteen parts, which\r\ndivide this kingdom of Yucathan and each age, with its idol, priest and\r\nprophecy, rules in one of these thirteen parts of this land, according\r\nas they have divided it; I do not give the names of the idols, priests\r\nor parts of the land, so as not to cause trouble, although I have made\r\na treatise[9.5] on these old counts with all their differences and\r\nexplanations, so that they may be evident to all, and the curious may\r\nlearn them, for, if we do not understand them, I affirm that the\r\nIndians can betray us face to face.\"[9.6]\r\n\r\n\r\nAvendano Explains the Prophecies. \"The said cacique pretended\r\nignorance, answering me that he did not understand these computations,\r\nbut I, in case what he said was true, in order that he might understand\r\nthem, explained them very minutely; and in order that he, if he did\r\nunderstand them, should not twist their meaning (as they are accustomed\r\nto do) with some of their superstitions, undertook with much pleasure\r\nthe work of sitting down at length with them, the King having come at\r\nthis time, (for he is the chief priest and master of them) with other\r\npriests and leaders who were there, before all of whom I carried on the\r\nsaid work, with the greatest pleasure and earnestness, so that there we\r\nmight discuss in the sight of all, how the time had already expired\r\n(according to their prophets) in which they should begin to become\r\nChristians. I also made a computation of these accounts (the King and\r\nsome of the priests aiding with their opinion) so that, confessing that\r\nthey were convinced, we agreed that four months thereafter was the time\r\nwanting to fill out the said period when all the older men would\r\nreceive baptism.... And so (they said) that this was the reply which\r\nthey gave to my message, with which I could go back to the Governor who\r\nsent me, until the said four months had passed. At the end of which\r\ntime they expected me, in order to carry out the agreement we had made,\r\nnotifying me that I should not come back by Cha Kan Ytza, through which\r\nI had come there, since those Indians were their enemies and might kill\r\nme, but that I should go by Tipu (the road through which lies in the\r\nopposite direction) where he [Canek], knowing that I had arrived would\r\ncome forward with all his people to receive me, informing me that from\r\nthe Peten Ytza (which is the court of the said King) to Tipu, which\r\nthey told me about, there were twelve days of travel, by which they\r\nleft me to understand the love with which they received my message and\r\nthe pleasure and good will which they had in becoming Christians.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nObjection of Covoh. \"The devil, envious of the results which were being\r\ngained and which would be gained by their and my fulfilling the\r\nagreement which I had made to return there in the said four months,\r\nwithout putting himself forward, took possession[9.7] anew of the heart\r\nof that old cacique called Covoh, as he did with the heart of Judas. As\r\nCovoh found himself among his enemies (as are the King and the larger\r\npart of Peten) and seeing that that which his wicked heart intended was\r\ncontrary to the agreement made in his presence, therefore he, as did\r\nthe rest of the caciques and captains, said they were convinced;\r\nnotwithstanding what had been said, the said Cacique Covoh burst forth\r\nin great anger in the following words:--'What matters it that the time\r\nhas come when we are to become Christians, if this slender point of my\r\nflint lance has not been worn out?' To this I answered him with the\r\nspecial favor and the special courage of God, 'You must know, Cacique\r\nCovoh, that he who permits me to come and argue with you (who is the\r\ntrue God of the Heavens) alone can give you this pleasure, if, for his\r\ngreater glory, he allows me to die; and if he does not allow it, in\r\nvain do you show this arrogance of yours, since, just as there is a\r\ntime marked out and determined for you to become Christians, so also\r\nare the times determined for me to die for love of him; and if it were\r\nleft in your hands, as you think, and say such things, you would have\r\ncarried it out, or the devil Pakoc (this is an idol who speaks to them\r\nvery frequently) whom you adore and who dictates such things to you;\r\nbut here you shall know how slight is his strength in my presence,\r\nsince he only dares to speak of it to you and not to come and execute\r\nit upon me. And I do not know (notwithstanding the great arrogance you\r\nshow) what victory there can be in so many of your armed men here,\r\nkilling so unjustly and without notice a few men like us, who, moved\r\nsolely by love of you, intend without any arms, but for your own good,\r\nto take you out of the slavery in which you stand. In short here I am;\r\nI know not what prevents you from carrying out what you say.' With\r\nthis, since it was late at night, they withdrew, and I with the King\r\nand the rest of the priests remained discussing the agreement which we\r\nhad made.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscussion with Canek and Others. \"On the next day, after performing\r\nbaptisms on some who came to me, talking with the King and some of the\r\ncaciques of the other _Petens_ or islands and other priests, who stayed\r\nwith us continually, we discussed at our leisure various matters which\r\ncame up. I asked them what products they had for their food and\r\nclothing, and they told me that they had a great deal of maize, beans,\r\nseeds, peppers, and that they sowed all this two or three times in the\r\nyear; also many plantains and _chunes_, which are like the _chayotes_,\r\nthough without thorns; some _cacao_ (though but little), vanilla, and\r\nin some orchards enclosed with stakes in their homes, some wild\r\ncabbage. I did not see these nor the onions, which, however, the\r\nsingers who accompanied me told me that they had seen;[9.8] there is a\r\ngreat deal of cotton, cochineal, and indigo, which accounts for the\r\nabundance of clothing which they have and give to the Cehaches Indians,\r\nand those from Tipu in barter for hatchets and _machetes_; and all this\r\nwoven very neatly, in a variety of colors of cotton thread; the said\r\nclothing is very durable, since it is like felt, although the colors of\r\ntheir cloth are not very permanent, from their not knowing; how to give\r\nit the finishing touch....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFriendliness of Canek. \"Because from the time that I had convinced them\r\nby their own ancient computations,--a thing that they considered\r\nimpossible for any other man except their priests to learn,--they began\r\nto love and fear me at the same time; saying that I was undoubtedly a\r\ngreat personage in the service of my Gods, since I had succeeded in\r\nlearning the language of their ancestors and their own, for from no one\r\nelse of all these neighboring natives had they heard it, nor did they\r\nhave any information that the Spaniards who subjugated their lands knew\r\nit.... On which account they called me Chomachahan, which means among\r\nthem, 'Great Lord, worthy of reverence,' and Citcaan, which means\r\n'Father of Heaven.' ...\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDemonstrations against Canek. \"Suddenly a disturbance arose without any\r\ncause, among the crowd of Indians, together with their head men and\r\ncaptains and some priests, in which in my presence they said to the\r\nKing many discourteous things, after which they went on to say,--'What\r\ngood was the friendship of the Spaniards and their law to be to them?\r\nIf it was to get hatchets and _machetes_ for cultivating, means had\r\nnever failed them to till their soil up to that time; if it was for the\r\nstuffs and cloths of Castile for clothing them, when did they need any\r\nof this, since theirs was very good; if it was that the Spaniards\r\nshould defend them, when was the Ytzalana nation cowardly or when did\r\nit humiliate itself to any one, since they had so many warriors for\r\ntheir own defense and for the destruction of as many as ventured\r\nagainst them? It was a very bad thing to receive them.' The King also\r\nopposed them in my presence with wisdom enough, defending in every\r\npoint what they and he had agreed on with me; and with more severity\r\nreproved the arrogant mention of arms, in that they had said it before\r\nme. They grew more disturbed with the reproof and the contestants\r\nincreased, and many, who up to that time had not spoken, then declared\r\nthemselves as opposed to him, all the said men bursting out against him\r\nwith words of great anger and exceeding boldness; all this discord was\r\ncaused by the said Cacique Covoh, who had not yet gone to his own town.\r\nI, who was paying attention to everything, seeing that all that great\r\ncrowd was already excited and not paying attention to one another,\r\nsince all were talking at the same time, rising by the side of the King\r\nand standing in the midst of them, said to them with some anger and\r\neffect:--'What is this? What disturbance and tumult is this, so\r\nentirely without foundation? Is it by chance because you have made an\r\nagreement with me to accept the friendship of the Spaniards and to\r\ntrade with them in peace and kindness? Well then, what dagger did I\r\npress against your breast in order to make these friendships and to\r\nagree upon this peace with you, other than the good-will with which you\r\nhave joined hands with me, knowing that already the time has come for\r\nyou and the Spaniards to eat together in one plate and to drink\r\ntogether from one cup in token that you are our brothers? It is without\r\ndoubt because you have remembered at this moment that you Indians are\r\nfickle in everything. Go, shame on you, and remember that you are\r\nYtzalanos, respected by everyone as people of intelligence and\r\nconsideration. Bear in mind that the agreement which you have made with\r\nme to be friends of the Spaniards is an intelligent act, by which you\r\nshow that you are not ignorant of your prophecies, and your executing\r\nit will do you much honor, since our King and Lord is the greatest\r\nmonarch that is found today in the world, to whom not only a few poor\r\nmen isolated as you are, but very extensive kingdoms and empires\r\nconsider themselves very fortunate in rendering and paying homage to\r\nhim. And besides, notice how your great Montezuma, as soon as they\r\ninformed him that my King was such a great Lord and that his empire was\r\nso extensive, offered him not only his crown, but also his person and\r\nkingdom, going as he did personally to offer it to him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLeniency Promised by the Padres. \"'But the Governor, who sends me, does\r\nnot intend to take anything from you nor from the King any part of his\r\ncommand, but instead, he wishes that all this should remain with him,\r\nas is evident from this clothing which I have placed upon him and by\r\nthat _baton_ which I have placed in his hand. This among the Spaniards\r\nis a sign of command and rule.... All this being so, why do you raise\r\nthis disturbance? Go, Ytzalanos, be ashamed of yourselves, since the\r\nagreement which you and your King have made with me is a very good\r\none.'\r\n\r\n\"With this I sat down again and they stood still without knowing what\r\nhad happened to them; and changing at once the conversation they\r\nindulged in much noisy mirth and laughter, playing jokes on each other,\r\nwithout thinking of the passed disturbance, as if it had not\r\nhappened....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAvendano Takes Steps to Protect the Itzas from Further Molestation.\r\n\"Suspecting that in my absence some Spaniards might come either from\r\nthis Province or that of Guatemala to make war on them, from their\r\nbeing around there in opening the road, they therefore asked me, in\r\norder to calm their hearts and as a token of peace, to give them some\r\nsure signs or well understood token, so that (in case any Spaniards\r\nshould come to their lands from this Province of Yucathan or from the\r\nother one of Guatemala) they should do them no harm nor make war on\r\nthem, when they showed them the said sign and well known token, which I\r\nshould leave them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Letter of Counsel. \"Then I left them the following letter:--\r\n\r\n\"Captains of whichever of the two Poles, North or South. My dear Lords.\r\nOur Lord was pleased to communicate to us his divine favor, in order to\r\nsucceed in obtaining that which for many ages no one has been able to\r\nobtain. (But nothing is impossible to the divine power, to whom may the\r\nglory be ascribed.) Because for his glory he has given opportunity to\r\nhumble the neck of this unconquerable Ytzalana nation, humbling itself\r\nat the first suggestion of the ministers of the gospel, and sons of my\r\nholy Padre, San Francisco, by promptly offering their children to the\r\nmost pure washing of baptism, I having baptized up to this time many of\r\nthem, with the sure hope of baptizing them all in a short time; though\r\nthe fathers and mothers, although gentle and peaceable with us, are\r\nnevertheless slow in giving up their idolatry; and for this reason\r\nespecially it is necessary to show moderation with great patience, so\r\nas to bear many such vexing acts as are due to the darkness in which\r\nthey have lived; on this account I beg your Graces to act with much\r\nprudence (if by chance you should come to this nation of the Ytzaes,\r\nwhose patron is Saint Paul) so as not to lose in a short time what is\r\nso much desired and has been attained, thanks be to God! They are\r\ninclined to receive you in peace when your Graces appear and to give\r\nyou what supplies, etc., that may be needed by you, in barter for\r\nhatchets, _machetes_ and other merchandise of Castile, which they wish\r\nfor exceedingly, but I do not know whether you will be well paid.

Your most humble servant and chaplain,--Fray\r\nAndres de Avendano, Apostolic Missionary Commissioner....\" There\r\nfollows the certification of this letter by the Apostolic Notary.\r\n\r\n\"... With this I delivered the letter to the King in the presence of\r\nmany chiefs and the greater part of the common people, so that all were\r\nsatisfied with such an agreement, and agreeing moreover, they with me\r\nand I with them, that within the said four months, I should come back\r\nto see them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Leaving Tayasal, Avendano Shames Covoh. \"Finding ourselves now\r\nvery near our departure, I notice how, after the last disturbance above\r\nreferred to, although it is true that the sermon that I preached to\r\nthem calmed their spirits, nevertheless the devil did not fail to sow\r\ntares in the hearts of the Cacique Covoh, whom I have spoken of many\r\ntimes, and in another cacique named Ahcan, a relation of the King of\r\nPeten, and in the Captain Covoh, with all his followers, all of whom\r\nare Cha Kan Ytzaes, noting here that the first settlement which I met\r\nwith on my entering the land of the said Cha Kan Ytzaes, was that of\r\nthe said Cacique Ahcan and his Captain Covoh, to whom I showed (as I\r\nsaid at the beginning of my said entrance) what I was bringing for the\r\nKing of Peten Itza; and these were the men who took away from us all\r\nthat we carried at the time of our embarking on the lake. These men I\r\ndid not fail to put to shame in Peten, before the King and the rest of\r\nthe chiefs, not complaining of what they had taken from us, from the\r\npoor supply of the priests and of the four Indian singers, who carried\r\ntheir change of clothes with them, but my regret was that they had\r\nstolen the entire suit of clothes, with its _sombrero_ and _baton_\r\nwhich the Governor had given me to give to the King in his name. This I\r\nscolded them for in earnest, asking them: 'What sort of way that was to\r\nreceive a messenger, taking away from him all that he had brought,\r\ninstead of giving a very kind reception?' This, with other effective\r\nreasons, I repeated on various occasions, until the clothes appeared,\r\nso that I myself clothed the King with them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hatred of the Chakan Itzas for the Padres Increases. \"The said\r\nChakanytzaes then, abashed that the said clothes had been found in\r\ntheir possession, conceived a hatred against me.... They made a plan\r\namong themselves to kill us, when we passed through their territories,\r\nwithout the King and the others in Peten knowing it. On account of\r\nthis, the said Cacique Can came with his Captain Covoh, with a great\r\ngourd full of _posole_, and with it entering the house of the King, in\r\nwhich. I was at the time stopping, he told me to drink what he had\r\nbrought me. I drank it without suspicion, for always had I trusted in\r\nthat text of the Evangelist '_si morfirum quid biberibit, non eis\r\nnosevit_.' And scarcely had I drank it, when they told me that they had\r\ncome to ask me for two of the four Indians whom I brought with me, who\r\nwere the fattest, so that the next day when I should pass by their\r\nhouse on my return, they should have made me something good to eat; for\r\nthe Indians would know how to prepare food for us in the way to which\r\nwe were accustomed. I, who recognized the wicked intention of the said\r\ninvitation, said to them, 'I cannot go without them, nor can they stay\r\nhere without me. When I go, they will go.' Then they replied,\r\n'Tomorrow, when the sun is up, we will all come for you, to accompany\r\nyou as we accompanied you hither.' 'Well and good,' I answered them.\r\nWith this they went off to their town very well satisfied, to prepare,\r\nwithout doubt, the _pib_ or fire where the two fat Indians, whom they\r\nasked me for, were to be cooked, and the stakes on which we were to be\r\nspitted, as we found out later.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCanek Helps the Padres to Escape. \"As soon as these men had gone, the\r\nKing said to me,--'You have done well in not giving them your servants,\r\nnor is it best for you to go back by their house nor by the road by\r\nwhich you came, but by the opposite road, which is that of Tipu, to\r\nwhich place I will accompany you; since you must know that this\r\ninvitation is to kill you, in order that the Spaniards may not know the\r\nroad by which you came. And they say that they are going to follow the\r\nCehaches Indians who guided you, as far as their houses in order to\r\nkill them; and so you must go tonight and when they come tomorrow they\r\nwill find that they have been tricked.' The Queen and her daughters\r\nconfirmed the truth of this, for, when the time came to embark, they\r\nsaid to us, 'They say that they are not going to kill you in any other\r\nway than by cutting you in little pieces,' and they made gestures with\r\none hand over the other, to show that they were going to make mince\r\nmeat of us and eat us. We started that night, as I have said, and I\r\nwill tell about it more fully farther on. So that, when they came for\r\nme, they found themselves tricked.\r\n\r\n\"In a rage at seeing their purposes frustrated, the said Cacique Can\r\nand his Captain Covoh and the other Cacique Covoh returned to their\r\nhomes with sixty Indian warriors of their followers.... The said\r\nChakanytzaes Indians came painted red and ready for war to the camp of\r\nthe General Alonso Garcia de Paredes, saying that I had sent them for\r\nthe ornaments and the rest of the baggage which I had left in the\r\ndeserted town of Chuntuci, a land adjoining the nation of the Cehaches,\r\nand that they came for the Padre who was taking care of these\r\nthings.... On their saying to the General that they came for the\r\nornaments, being sent by me, the said General said to them, 'Nor does\r\nhis servant come with you?' 'Neither does he come,' they replied, 'so\r\nhe merely sends us in this way.' Then he brought out wine to give them\r\nand sent them with the Padre Apostolic Notary to the said town of\r\nChuntuci, which was distant some few leagues from the camp, that he\r\nmight deliver to them the baggage and sacred vessels.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nParedes' Stupidity; the Plot of the Chakan Itzas. \"Cursed be the\r\nignorance which causes so great losses in this way! Of how great\r\nimportance is knowledge and experience for the proper despatch of\r\nthings! This General has no more knowledge or experience, except for\r\ncutting wild trees in the forest where he has always been placed,\r\ncutting timber for building the ships which sail from the port of\r\nCampeche. And so he missed at the present time the greatest victory\r\nwhich could be gained in this kingdom of Yucatan.... Is it possible\r\nthat reason did not tell him, even if he was ignorant of the said\r\npoints and of the military laws, that a priest and minister of God was\r\nnot going to send sixty Indians for the sacred vessels and the Padre\r\nwho guarded them, without sending him a message in writing (as I\r\npromised to do when I took my leave) or without writing to the said\r\nPadre my companion to come with them? Is it possible that, on seeing\r\nthat neither had I sent even one of the four Indians who accompanied\r\nme, even if I was not able to write, so that they could deliver the\r\nsacred things to him, he was not surprised enough to infer from that,\r\neither that what the sixty Indians said was false, or that they had\r\nkilled us,--especially as he saw them come painted red and in warlike\r\narray and had entered impudently into the camp? Spare me from such an\r\nact, for in this case (although I do not understand military laws)\r\nreason dictates that he ought to have imprisoned them and disarmed them\r\nuntil he had satisfied himself whether what they said was true, taking\r\ntwo of them as guides, and sending an officer with the necessary people\r\nbehind them, to investigate the truth of what had happened, and\r\naccording to the result, to act in the following way,--if it was true\r\nthat I sent them without a letter or sure token, he should have laid\r\nthe blame on me and should have honored the prisoners by accompanying\r\nthem with all his people to take possession of their lands in the name\r\nof the King our Lord, since then he would know that this was the sign\r\nwhich I gave him when I took my leave of him, that the said Ytzaes\r\nwished to become Christians and accepted the friendship of the\r\nSpaniards; and if it was not true, he should then have made use of\r\nseverity and the military laws. For, if the story that I sent them was\r\nfalse, as it was, and if he had used military severity with their three\r\nprincipal chiefs, who were the Cacique Covoh and the Cacique Can and\r\nthe Captain Covoh, all of whom the King of Peten, in his answer to the\r\nmessage, told me were his enemies, and said that if the Governor\r\nexecuted them, he (the King) would deliver over all the _Petens_, then\r\nall the nations of the Ytzaes would have been conquered and delivered\r\nto the King our Lord, and at this moment they would all have been\r\nChristians without the said victory costing a shot of powder.... And he\r\nought not to have allowed them to go behind the said Padre, my\r\ncompanion, some leagues away, with the risk that the said heathen might\r\nkill the priest without the merit of being in the service of God; and\r\nwith the risk of their stealing and misusing the sacred vessels.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chakan Itzas are Foiled by God. \"But God, who looks after his\r\naffairs, arranged that on the said Chakanytzaes coming near the\r\nornaments, they, pretending a need, told the Padre to await them there,\r\nand they went into the woods and went to their town without having\r\naccomplished any of the many purposes for which they came; the first,\r\nto see if they had got ahead of me and my companions (understanding\r\nthat we had passed through their territories by night) so as to carry\r\nout their intention of killing us; the second, to see if they could\r\ncatch the three Cehaches Indians, our guides, who returned to their\r\nhomes by that road, so as to kill them; the third to see how many\r\nSpanish people were in the camp for working on the road which they were\r\nopening, so as to flee if they were many and to resist them if they\r\nwere few; the fourth to satisfy their greed by stealing the sacred\r\nvessels with the rest of the wares of Castile which they thought I\r\nbrought with me. But they found it all in vain, thanks be given to God,\r\nwho thus looked after his priests and the materials for celebrating\r\nmass; and not to the inconsiderate action of the said principal head,\r\nby which he showed so little regard for looking after the things of God\r\nand his ministers; but thus God has brought out all things well,\r\naccording to the purposes for which he has worked....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Departure of the Padres from Tayasal. \"Let us turn from this\r\ndigression to the departure from Peten. In order to frustrate the\r\npretended invitation which the Chakanytzaes gave us, we left with grief\r\nand tears enough on the part of the family of the King and his friends,\r\nat about nine o'clock at night in the company of the King, his son and\r\nhis son-in-law,--all three rowing in the canoe at a good speed. We came\r\nto the other part of the lake in the direction of the East, which is\r\nthe road to Tipu, at between three and four o'clock of the next\r\nmorning. When we landed here, on renewing our signs of affection with\r\nthe King and he with us, he again recalled to me the past agreement,\r\nsaying 'See that you do not forget to tell your Governor that I love\r\nhim much and wish to be his friend and that of the Spaniards, and not\r\nto fail to kill my said rivals, the Chakanytzaes, for I am sure that I\r\nshall deliver to him the _Petens_ which I rule. And do not fail to come\r\nto see us, as you say, and let it be by this road of Tipu, so that I\r\nwith all my people may come out to receive you.' All these words did\r\nthe King say to me, holding me in a loving embrace.\r\n\r\n\"He remained alone on the canoe to return before they should miss him,\r\nand to us he gave his son and son-in-law as guides, with their bows and\r\narrows to defend us from anyone who might wish to do us harm. They\r\nguided us through some very large plains or meadows, though afterwards\r\nthere were some very good bits of hills, with some bad stretches of mud\r\nand water, and larger hills, so that, considering that it rained every\r\nday, wetting us very thoroughly, since we did not have any place or\r\nwherewithal to shelter us, the journey was the more troublesome and\r\ndangerous.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAvendano Goes Eastward to Yalain. \"In this way we came to the first\r\nsettlement of Peten Ytza, on the main land, in an easterly direction,\r\nwhich is called Yalain, which is distant from Peten Ytza to that place,\r\nten very long leagues,--six on the water and four on land up to said\r\ntown. This town consists of very few houses close together, but also of\r\nmany farms well peopled, at a distance in a circle of one or two\r\nleagues. All are Indians of Peten Ytza, who came there to farm,\r\nalthough there are also some from Tipu, and all are dwellers in the\r\nsaid town, in which are found many Indians called Canekes, like the\r\nKing of Peten, but they are not relations of his, but are natives of\r\nhis district, which (as I have said) take their names from those who\r\nrule the said districts, although they may have, as they do, their own\r\nsurnames, each one from the father and mother. A priest more than\r\nfifty-four years old, according to his appearance, called Chomachculu,\r\nrules this town, a great comrade and confidant of the King Canek, to\r\nwhom the said King sent us, well recommended, so that he might give us\r\nas good reception and attention as he would to himself. And this they\r\ndid, for, as soon as we came, they gave us very good things to eat and\r\ntook us to a new house, which was only thatched, but they had not put\r\ndown the floor. This house, they told us was for us, ... and (they told\r\nus) how in the month of September of the past year of ninety-five,\r\nthere had gone to Merida, four Indians who said that they were from\r\nTipu, with whom I had intercourse, and I gave them something to eat in\r\nour cell.... I heard that the said Indians asked for ministers of the\r\ngospel so that they should administer to them the divine word and the\r\nholy sacraments.... So when we came to this town of Yalain, its\r\ninhabitants began to ask us about these four Indians who went to Merida\r\nin the said month of September, (who had not yet come back).... In\r\nreply I asked them if the men were one Achan with his younger brother,\r\nand another called Ahtec, and another Anu, and they said 'Yes.' To this\r\nI replied that I did not know why they had not come to their town, as\r\nthey had started so long before I did.... We stopped in that town two\r\ndays, its inhabitants treating us very well. From there they were to\r\ngive us a guide to pass on to Tipu, as the priest Chomachculu promised\r\nus in compliance with the request which the King of Peten made of him,\r\nand on this supposition the son and son-in-law of the King, who had\r\nguided us up to that time, returned home. But they said that this guide\r\nwas to be an Indian of Tipu, who came to Peten while we were there,\r\nand, though the said Indian saw us leave Peten, he never came at all,\r\nbut rather stayed there.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTrouble with Soldiers. \"We were staying on in hopes that this man would\r\ncome, when we saw coming six or eight Indians from Peten, who (as they\r\ntold us) were coming to their farms. These brought the news that there\r\nhad been a disturbance in Peten, on account of there having come in the\r\npart where we had entered Indians from this side of the Province, and\r\nthat they had heard musket shots, with a rumor of Spaniards. I do not\r\nknow if this was true, but what we experienced from this time on from\r\nthe Indians of that town where we were staying was that they cooled off\r\nentirely in that affection with which up to that time they had regarded\r\nus, showing us a thousand slights without paying any attention to\r\ngiving us the guide which we asked for. The change in their hearts came\r\nto such an extreme that they called a meeting (drinking a great deal of\r\ntheir drink, with which not only they get drunk, as they were then, but\r\nwith which they worship). We came then to a time when on that night the\r\ntaking of our lives had been determined on, had not God wished that I\r\nshould learn about the matter; and so I taking from them the implements\r\nof their feast, and reproving them for the little firmness of their\r\nhearts, they came to understand that we knew the wickedness of their\r\nactions. Then they all gathered together around us, and without any\r\nmore noise or disturbance, they kept us company all night. Scarcely had\r\nthe dawn come when (perhaps in remorse for their sin) they began to\r\ntreat us with the same affection as at the beginning and to give us an\r\nIndian who guided us to the other farms, half a league from there,\r\nwhich, from the abundance of the fruit, appeared an orchard. There was\r\nanother priest called Chomach punab, who received us with very great\r\nkindness, giving orders to call all the Indians, men and women, in the\r\nvicinity, so that they might see us, and asking us to stop and have\r\nsomething to eat. We yielded to his importunity in order, by showing\r\nourselves pleased, to reciprocate so much kindness as they showed us.\r\nThe wife of one of the four Indians who I said before came to Merida,\r\nnamed Ahtec, spoke to me. Hardly had we accepted the invitation, when\r\nall the Indian women went to their houses, to make something for us to\r\neat; and in a short time they came back, each one of them with her bowl\r\nof meat, according to what they had, with many _tortillas_, so that we,\r\nwith the Indians who accompanied us, should eat; the Indians promising\r\nus that some of them would accompany us. And, scarcely had we eaten and\r\ntold them to come to guide us, when suddenly they turned back, without\r\nour being able to get anything from them, except that an Indian came\r\nabout half a mile, to set us upon that obscure path, which led towards\r\nthe direction of Tipu, telling us that up to that place, we had to\r\nspeed on the way twelve days, from sunrise to sunset; and that, two\r\nleagues before that, we should come across a great river, which we had\r\nto pass, but he did not tell us how nor where.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Padres Suffer Hardships and Lose their Way. \"With this he returned\r\nto his house and we went on with twenty maize tortillas which we had\r\nkept, of those which they had brought us to eat. With these we\r\nsustained ourselves, seven people of us, for five days, at the end of\r\nwhich we came across a great river, having before this met with many\r\nand very large _aguadas_ and having passed many ridges and hills, with\r\nso many other evident dangers that some fatality might happen to us.\r\nNotwithstanding this, we took some pleasure at having found this great\r\nriver,--first, because we thought that we had not lost ourselves, since\r\nwe had found the river with signs which they gave us; and second,\r\nbecause we found ourselves (as it appeared to us) near Tipu, where we\r\ncould remedy the want of supplies from which we were suffering. But our\r\npleasure was marred, since, following the footsteps or obscure path,\r\nalong the banks of this river, on the fifth day of our following them,\r\nand on the tenth day of the want of supplies from which we suffered, we\r\nfound ourselves entirely lost, in a greater perplexity than any human\r\nbeing could find himself;--that is, surrounded on one side by the great\r\nfull and broad river and surrounded on the other sides by another\r\nmultitude of little streams with great density of low trees, so that it\r\ndid not appear possible that we could pass through them; and on another\r\nside were some cliffs and very high ridges so that we were not able, by\r\nmaking use of the trees, to climb up the heights. In the midst of this\r\nstruggle determined to follow the direction to the Northwest, so as to\r\nreach the deserted town of Chanchanha, and to cross the head streams of\r\nthe great rivers and _aguadas_ which surround it, since in this\r\ndirection it was not possible for us to fail in finding it. We went\r\nthree days in this direction, and from thinking that, if we missed the\r\nconvent of Chanchanha, in this direction, there was afterwards no place\r\nto have recourse to, on account of the great distance that we were from\r\na town on all sides, a great sadness came over my companion Padres, so\r\nthat they told me that we should change our direction, since, if we did\r\nnot, it was certain that we should perish in these forests, and that\r\nthe best thing was to try to strike the road which was being opened\r\nfrom this Province to that of Guatemala, which runs from North to\r\nSouth. To please them I yielded the opinion which I had determined on.\r\nFrom there we took the direction to the West, although the distance in\r\nleagues and forests which we intended to traverse was more than sixty\r\nor seventy. This distance was a great one, for us to be able, breaking\r\nthrough such bad thickets and suffering from hunger for thirteen days,\r\nto come through alive, without exaggeration.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHard Travel in the Wilderness for Fifteen Days. \"In those fifteen days\r\nthat we traveled in a northwesterly direction, we met with many\r\n_akalchees_, or swamps, which consist of very bad passages through\r\nwater and low and thorny shrubs with a kind of square grass, which, if\r\nit caught our clothes, held us by the multitude of thorns, which grow\r\non the four corners from top to bottom; and if it caught our face,\r\nhands or legs, it cut them like a small saw; so that as most of the\r\nwoods are _akalchees_, which consist of this grass, except on the high\r\nplaces, we were always walking with our feet, hands or faces wounded,\r\nso that we did not know what to do. Thus wounded, we went through some\r\nvery long _akalchees_, when we directed one of the Indians whom we\r\nbrought, to climb a tree so as to look out and see where we could make\r\na short cut through the said _akalche_, for we were not able to suffer\r\nany longer on account of the many sores which the said grass caused us.\r\nThis said Indian climbed the tree, and gave us the news that he had\r\ndiscovered a great meadow or plain towards the northwest. Some instinct\r\nmade me believe it, but to see whether imagination and the wish we had\r\nto find it, had this effect, we took that direction, so that in a\r\nlittle while we came upon the said meadow; but as we entered it, at the\r\nbeginning it had half a yard of water; we went ploughing through it and\r\nat each step there was more water, and it took a long time to cross it,\r\ncausing us pain enough in our wounds. But with the care that we took\r\nnot to get submerged, we forgot that feeling, since the earth of the\r\nsaid marsh was so spongy that though we doubled up the reeds which grew\r\nthere in large number, so as to step over it, so that the water might\r\nhold us up, yet if we stopped a moment, the overflowed earth drew and\r\nsucked us in in such a way, that if we should fall, we could not help\r\none another, since he who should stop to help the other, would be\r\nsubmerged with him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMiracle of the Bent Branch. \"At the end of a long stretch of this\r\ntrouble, we reached some little woods, with trees of considerable\r\nheight, which were as much, or more, covered with water as what we had\r\npassed through. We passed through these as well as we could, having in\r\nmind that that was now coming to an end, when suddenly we came across a\r\nvery large _aguada_ of the kind they call Kaxek, in which no bottom is\r\nfound. Armed with patience, although with some trouble from the fact\r\nthat the sun was about to set, considering that we had to stay there\r\nthat night, I made an Indian climb one of the said trees, so as to see\r\nwhere the _aguada_ ended, or where we could make a short cut through\r\nthe said _aguada_; and the said Indian not discovering a passage in any\r\npart to our great sorrow, we, looking towards one side, saw a branch of\r\na tree broken, like those which the Indians break so as not to lose\r\nthemselves in the woods. We attributed this sign to a miracle, as it\r\nwas not probable that a human being could place that sign in that\r\nplace. We followed that sign in an easterly direction, which was that\r\ntowards which the said branch was bent, until, when, at a little\r\ndistance, we came upon another branch bent in the same way and very\r\nrecently. At this we were consoled by the miracle which God kept\r\ncontinuing. We went on with sticks in our hands, trying the shallow\r\nplaces, because, when we least expected it, we came on many holes of\r\nalligators (since they are found in abundance in the said overflowed\r\nwoods) and then we were submerged almost to our heads. We discovered a\r\npiece of level ground, about as large as the ante-room of a cell, and\r\nthinking that it was solid, we started to pass over it, but on its\r\nbearing the weight of the body, not only did all the ground shake, but\r\nthe part where we pressed on it, sinking, submerged us also with it;\r\nmany alligators starting from under it and fleeing from their holes, so\r\nthat we went on with great misgiving--one, so as not to sink in, the\r\nother, for fear that some of these alligators would cut off a leg of\r\nours at a mouthful. This was all a pure miracle, since there also we\r\ncame across the third branch close by a ridge, where we went to sleep\r\nthat night very well contented, although so wet, because God had freed\r\nus from that trouble in which we were.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Uncomfortable Night. \"We came out of that place about sunset, and\r\nclimbing the high ridge which we met with, we went to rest there, cold\r\nenough from being drenched with water, even to the lint which we had\r\nfor striking fire, unable to get comfort by warming ourselves. We\r\noffered to God the trouble we had passed and even with more fervor the\r\ntrouble which follows from sleeping in wet clothes. But remembering\r\nthat the Indians are accustomed to make fire with two dry sticks, and\r\nhaving no other than the staff which I carried, we broke it, and with\r\nthis God willed that we should obtain fire. We made a great fire, with\r\nwhich we not only dried our garments and underclothes, but warmed\r\nourselves very well. In the vicinity of the fire we went to sleep.\r\n\r\n\"On the next day when we left this place, we discovered a large plain\r\nor meadow, which horrified us just to see it, on account of what had\r\nhappened on the preceding afternoon, but as it was free from woods, we\r\nwere happy in passing over it, and more so as we had seen in the\r\ndistance many pine trees all about it, so that, thinking of their\r\nfruits, we had hopes of getting something to eat; but our hope was in\r\nvain, since, when we came to see whether they had cones, they had them,\r\nbut without seeds. We had recourse to other trees, which appeared to be\r\nevergreen oaks, with the acorns of which, if there were any, we might\r\ngive our bodies some sustenance; but they were nothing but oak trees\r\nwhich had nothing but leaves. Crossing this field, we came upon a path\r\nwell frequented by animals, and as the grass was tall, their tracks\r\nwere not seen; notwithstanding which, in some marshes, where there was\r\nno grass and the soil was only damp, we saw that the tracks were like\r\nthose of an ox or bull. We wondered at this, from there not being seen\r\nin a long distance from there any herd of cattle, so that for the time\r\nbeing we suspended judgment.... But when in the Province I told this to\r\npeople who go through forests, they told me that those tracks were of\r\ndeer, for there are such in this Province. I offer no objection to\r\nthere being as many wild animals as can be imagined, since the woods\r\nare very well fitted for them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat Want of Food. \"At the end of the said three days in which we\r\npassed through these troubles, taking a westerly direction, we again\r\nbegan to break through woods and with greater difficulty (than before),\r\nsince hunger kept wearing out our strength and the ridges which we met\r\nin the space of three days were so high in all four directions, that it\r\nseemed impossible that men could cross them, on account of the great\r\nheight of their summits and the depth and shallowness of their ravines.\r\nThe trees of these hills of which we availed ourselves so as not to\r\nfall, are some palms which are called _Cumes_, covered with thorns\r\nwhose sharp points are very long and cover the tree from top to bottom\r\nas far as the roots; so that all our bodies were wounded by the said\r\nthorns from head to foot, particularly our feet, since we went\r\nbarefoot. At this time came the day of Purification of Our Lady, when\r\nwe prepared in spirit for celebrating that day, all of us confessing\r\none another, as men who at every moment had death before their eyes, on\r\naccount of the great want of food. And in order to obtain the holy\r\nindulgences of that day, we had anticipated it by finding on the\r\npreceding days some date palms, with the fruit in season, of which we\r\nmade use for eating on those days, as well as some _sapote mameys_,\r\nwhich, though they were as hard as stone, from their not being in\r\nseason, we cooked for eating.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Situation Grows Still Worse. \"All this appeared to us now very\r\nhard, to have to live only on these dates without any food. But in two\r\nor three days after we found the dates and _sapotes_, the situation\r\nbecame more serious (and much worse after many days); for not having\r\nfound anything to eat for three days, nor even to drink, as my mind\r\nturned more and more to spiritual things, since it was not hindered by\r\nany bodily functions, which would prevent its reasoning powers, so\r\ngreat was the occurrence of texts of scripture, examples of saints, and\r\nincidents which it remembered, that I recalled very readily everything\r\nthat I had read; so that sometimes the said conditions brought about\r\ngreater resignation to God, knowing that it was then that he was of\r\nmore assistance to his creature, when he purified him more in the\r\ncrucible of affliction; and at other times such memories served as a\r\ngreater encouragement; (although my resignation never failed). Then\r\nremembering that there was no bird nor animal among the forest trees of\r\nwhich divine Providence does not take care, as well in the adornment of\r\nclothing as in giving his daily sustenance, and that to us, who were\r\nrational beings, created in his image and likeness, the contrary\r\nhappened, without our having, not only anything to eat, but not even\r\nwater to drink, this was an intellectual argument which we kept\r\nmeditating on, as we went along the road without stopping.\r\n\r\n\"But this meditation of mine beginning to search the recesses of my\r\nconscience in my past life, scarcely had it come to the threshold of\r\nthis argument, when, knowing that its faults deserved much greater\r\npunishment, it bore the present ones with patience and prepared itself\r\nfor greater ones in the future; but as the disordered appetite of this\r\nunrestrained body called out each day for our daily food, remembering\r\nthat God himself had taught us to ask for it, though I knew that its\r\nnot being found was a chastisement of my sins, not on this account did\r\nI fail to continue the petition every day, particularly at the hour\r\nwhen I knew that my brothers were eating in the refectories, with such\r\npleasure and tranquillity, without perhaps remembering us....\r\n\r\n\"When the hour of noon was passing, on which at the accustomed hour of\r\neating we remembered said pleadings, there passed also our desire for\r\nthe said meal, considering that, since God did not give it, it was not\r\nsuitable for us, and thus that his most holy will should be done in\r\neverything, and that if it was best for us to suffer more, his holy\r\nMajesty sent it. Here the soul ruled, but it could not fail that the\r\nbody also asked for an offering which would preserve our lives, which\r\nit brought forward by continually asking for it, as one who needed it\r\nso much. I then, leaning on the faith which I had in my Father, San\r\nDiego, on the one side, and on the great need which I suffered on the\r\nother, seeing that in reply to my prayers, San Diego had accomplished\r\nnothing as it appeared to me, in my mind I directed the said Saint, in\r\nholy obedience, now that my prayers were not accepted for my many sins,\r\nthat he should go, moved by his great charity, to the gates of Heaven\r\nto ask alms in the name of his brothers who were lost in these parts\r\nand perishing from want,--an extraordinary thing truly. A wonderful\r\nevent which I relate for the greater confusion of me and my audacity\r\nand for the greater glory of the humility and prompt obedience of my\r\nFather, San Diego.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThey Find Some Miraculous Honey. \"Scarcely had we gone twenty steps\r\nfrom where I bade him for obedience sake, when we met with a sapote\r\ntree, rotten and fallen on the ground, in which we found a bee-hive,\r\nand the occurrence is the more wonderful in that, having no implement\r\nfor cutting or taking out the said bee-hive, other than the pike or\r\npoint of my staff, the said trunk happened to be rotten; so that with\r\nthe said spike, we took the bee-hive out; besides the fact that the\r\ntree had laid fallen for many years, the hive was freshly occupied, so\r\nthat there is no doubt that, while there were so many trees standing\r\nstrong and sound, they went to swarm in a trunk, rotten and fallen to\r\nthe ground; so that it is an evident miracle which my Glorious Father,\r\nSan Diego, prepared for me. So when we came across the bee-hive, with\r\ngreat tenderness and to my greater confusion, I began to weep,\r\nconfessing my sin to my companions, the Padres, which only my great\r\nfaith and the want from which we were suffering could excuse. We ate\r\nthat honey with its embryos and its excrement, without in our great\r\nhunger reserving any part of it; and though the honey which fell to our\r\nshare was not much, since there were seven portions which were made of\r\nit, nevertheless it caused great thirst, as we had brought no water\r\nwith us, and did not find any for a long time afterwards. This happened\r\nto us the day of the Purification of Our Lady, as I said before.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo Padres Go Ahead. \"On this day, it appearing to my two Padre\r\ncompanions, either that hunger and want were lasting a long time, since\r\nfifteen days of it were already passing or that we now found ourselves\r\nnear the road which we sought; guided as much by the law of nature\r\nwhich obliged them to save their lives, as by the love with which they\r\nloved me, seeing also that I was overcome as well by my needs as by the\r\ncontinual attacks of stomach troubles from which I suffered, and that\r\nthey, by being younger, could walk more leagues than the three leagues\r\nwhich I walked each day, by which speed, if they reached safety first,\r\nnot only would they save their lives, but also would aid me with some\r\nassistance, so that I should not perish in the woods, they said to me,\r\n'Father our Commissioner, we wish to go forward with the benediction\r\nand permission of your Reverence, to see if we can make greater\r\nprogress each day by some leagues, so as by this means to reach some\r\nsettlement, from which to send you some assistance, to aid your\r\nReverence; and if we should be delayed in getting out of the woods, and\r\nshould meet with the soldiers, we would send some of them whenever we\r\nmet them, so that they may extricate your Reverence and that you may\r\nnot perish in these forests. We are of no importance, and as such, we\r\nshall not be missed. But as for your Reverence, on whose shoulders so\r\nmuch depends, such as giving an account to our Prelate and to our Lord\r\nthe Governor of everything that has happened, your loss would be of\r\nimportance. Therefore we beg your Reverence to give us your blessing in\r\ncarrying out what has been said, giving us one of these Indians to\r\naccompany us, and one of the two needles which you have, so as to\r\nfollow the direction to the west which we are taking.' I, that I might\r\nnever be held responsible for any loss or harm that might come to them,\r\ngranted them the Indian they picked out, the needle, blessing and\r\npermission, although I knew we were yet very far off from arriving in\r\nthe four days that they thought.\r\n\r\n\"We took leave of each other with the mutual love and tenderness, which\r\nthe loving companionship of those who had followed me faithfully\r\nthrough so great hardships required. We charged each other to remember\r\none another in our poor and humble prayers. With this they went off\r\nwith the benediction of God and of myself, I remaining with the three\r\nIndians, though one was dying (and he died later) and the rest with\r\ntheir strength exhausted as mine was.\r\n\r\n\"The departure of the Padres, my companions, and my beginning to\r\nundergo new calamities, was all at the same time; for on those first\r\nthree days it was all passing through _akalchees_, or overflowed lands,\r\nalthough they were dry but very much obstructed and closed up with low\r\nand thorny trees which grew there, and with those cutting grasses which\r\nI spoke of above, so that we were in constant trouble in passing\r\nthrough them, reopening once more all the wounds which we had on our\r\nlegs. And at that time we found ourselves with bare feet and legs, and\r\nwith our clothes in pieces, without getting any more comfort from them\r\nthan to cover myself with them at night; also a steel for striking\r\nfire, which by a miracle we saved among the heathen Ytzaes, belonged to\r\nmy companions, so that they took it with them, and I remained without\r\nany human comfort, nor did they take anything except the said steel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA Desperate Situation. \"In this final and extreme need we remained so\r\nabsolutely destitute of everything, that only by some angel bringing us\r\nfood and placing it in our mouths, could we nourish this living body;\r\nbecause, even if we should find anything, either animals or birds of\r\nthe forest, we had nothing to kill them with, and, even if they put\r\nthemselves into our hands for killing, we had no knife nor machete to\r\nskin them with, if they were animals, nor anything to cook them with\r\nfor want of a steel for striking fire. From this it can be inferred\r\nthat, being wet every day, at least with the dew, besides the showers\r\nwhich caught us, and having to sleep on the bare earth, wherever night\r\ncame upon us, whether it was wet or dry, we were unable to get any\r\ncomfort, besides not having any means of making fire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThey Find Some Edible Thistles. \"Notwithstanding, the said _akalchees_\r\nwere not what exhausted us most, nor were they so unkind to us that\r\namongst them we did not find something to eat and drink; since on some\r\ntrees there were _Chuis_, which are like large edible thistles, the\r\nleaves of which preserve the water from the dew and rains for a long\r\ntime, and by tapping them in the stem, the water which they have\r\npreserved comes out, although it is dirty and bad smelling; but the\r\nthirst we felt was more so. These same plants served us for food, by\r\neating the stems of each leaf, something like two fingers of white that\r\nthey have, since that part is the most tender, and the rest is very\r\nbitter and hard. In the same way we used to find in the said\r\n_akalchees_ some roots of trees to gnaw, so that, as the proverb says,\r\n'Afflictions with bread are of less account,' we did not feel the sores\r\nwhich those cutting grasses had caused us, as I have said, in exchange\r\nfor what we found there of food and drink.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Hills are Reached. \"These three days of _akalchees_ having passed,\r\nthere followed three other days of hills and very high ridges, so that\r\nwe inevitably had to pass them, since they lay in all four directions.\r\nThese followed one after the other in such a way that, having finished\r\nclimbing one, we went down it again, without finding an eighth of a\r\nmile level below. Upon which we again ascended the next one, for all of\r\nthese were so high that their heights cannot be told except to say that\r\nin their deep valleys the rays of the sun do not penetrate. So weak did\r\nwe become from ascending these hills on account of the fatigue, as well\r\nas by going down, because of the stony ground, or for both reasons, it\r\nwas necessary to make use of the trees, which cover the hills, the most\r\nof which are the said palms called _Cumes_, full of penetrating thorns,\r\nwhich injured our feet, hands and bodies, since falling from weariness,\r\nwe were wont to strike against them.\r\n\r\n\"On the top, then, of one of these hills, we found a broad _aguada_,--a\r\nthing which surprised us much, since there were not any other high\r\nplaces around it, from which the water could come. There were there\r\nvery many flint stones which caused injury enough to our feet on\r\naccount of our going barefoot. I do not know to what to attribute that\r\nwater on that high hill top, since in the preceding ravines, which, for\r\nthe most part, were rivers, although now dry, water was not found,\r\nexcept to a miracle, by which God gave us to understand that he had not\r\nforgotten our needs, since with so much climbing up and down as we had\r\nbeen through, we were thirsty enough, so that God furnished this\r\n_aguada_, from which we had a very good drink. In about an eighth of a\r\nmile we came to the descent from this height, after which we passed two\r\ndays of woods, some that were somewhat level, without so many or so\r\nhigh hills, but it is wonderful that though these forests in which we\r\ntraveled for two days and the three preceding ones, consist of an\r\ninfinite number of _sapote_ and _ramon_ trees, we did not find in them\r\nall a bit to eat,--a thing which happens in these woods as in the rest\r\nthat I saw. Seeing their sterility, I said, 'They appeared in every\r\nrespect like those of Gilboa.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDeserted Buildings. \"With so few comforts and so great affliction, our\r\nstrength went on diminishing very quickly, knowing for truth the\r\nproverb which the Biscayans, my fellow countrymen, say: 'It is the guts\r\nwhich carry and support the legs and not the legs, the guts.' Among\r\nthese high hills which we passed over, there is a variety of old\r\nbuildings, excepting some in which I recognized apartments, and though\r\nthey were very high and my strength was little, I climbed up them\r\n(though with trouble). They were in the form of a convent, with the\r\nsmall cloisters and many living rooms all roofed over, and arched like\r\na wagon and whitened inside with plaster, which is very abundant\r\nthrough that region, since all the ridges are composed of it. So that\r\nthese buildings do not resemble those which are here in this Province,\r\nfor the latter are of pure worked stone, laid without mortar,\r\nparticularly the part which relates to arches; but the former are of\r\nrough stone and mortar, covered with plaster.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFalse Hopes; Further Hardships. \"It seemed to us that these buildings\r\nstood near a settlement, from the information which the soldiers had\r\ngiven us, when we were going on the new road to Guatemala, but it\r\nturned out to be the dream of a blind man, since we found ourselves, as\r\nwe saw afterwards, very far from a settlement. We traveled through\r\nthese woods when we came upon a dry river, which we followed a long\r\nwhile to see if we found water, which we came across, though late,\r\nwhich is better than never. Before that, God willed that we should meet\r\na _Kamas_, or a great mound of earth, which the ants build, in which we\r\nfound a little honey to eat, and, as every sweet thing at once calls\r\nfor water, and we were late in finding it, it did not fail to give us\r\ntrouble. By following the abovementioned river, we came to the said\r\n_aguada_, which was quite large, similar to those which they call\r\n_Petens_. This made us go around through plenty of woods and\r\naffliction, so as to get past it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThey Face Starvation. \"We passed the said _aguada_ and afterwards some\r\nhills, with other rivers, although they were dry, though the hollows in\r\nthem were a proof of their being very full in the rainy season. The\r\nsigns were not deceptive, for at a little distance we fell in with a\r\ngreat _cibal_ or pond full of those grasses with broad and cutting\r\nleaves, of which I spoke before. This was, according to its distance\r\nwhich was lost to sight, more than two leagues long and half a league\r\nbroad. Into this discharged the currents of the rivers of which I\r\nspoke, and it cost us much trouble to go around it, so as to pass it,\r\nchanging our course in this, as in the other cases, which I have spoken\r\nof, always to the North. In all this time we had nothing to eat, except\r\nthe little honey that I spoke of, so that the animated mass of bones,\r\nowing to the continued troubles of traveling every day and not eating,\r\nnow kept growing weaker and weaker. In such a great extremity of a\r\nman's dying without sickness or infirmity, being in his perfect senses,\r\none can well understand what cries he would utter to God and to his\r\nmost holy mother, and to all the saints of his prayers, not only\r\nintended for his bodily comfort, but in order that he should not die\r\namong beasts without the sacraments and in order that God should bring\r\nhim to die among brothers as a Catholic, and receive the holy\r\nsacraments.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA Sign from our Lady of the Apparition. \"The affliction which my dying\r\nwithout them among those wild trees caused me, God, on whom my heart\r\ncalled, alone knows. In like manner, there was not a saint of my\r\nprayers to whom I did not pray, and even lovingly complained that they\r\nshould leave me in this way to die in these woods; yet my thinking\r\nthat, if this should happen, it would probably be the will of God, was\r\nwhat mitigated all my sufferings. Nevertheless among all the Saints I\r\ncalled upon to bring me out to die in a settlement, was our Lady who\r\nappeared at Campeche, and scarcely did I call upon her in my mind (for\r\nthus were all my pleas) to come to my aid, when at once we saw bent\r\nbranches of trees, a proof that people had come through those places.\r\nFrom then on I put away the needle in the sleeve of my habit, without\r\ntaking it out, following the said track wherever it went. I kept on\r\nfollowing it for four days through paths as clear as they were\r\ndifferent from those we had found. The Indians were troubled when they\r\nsaw that I was going in a contrary direction and advised me to leave\r\nsuch trails and to go in a westerly direction. I, who alone knew how\r\nthe said _Batche_ signs appeared on my invoking our Lady of the\r\nApparition, replied to them that they should come along since whoever\r\nhad showed me that _Batche_ or broken branches (which is a road for\r\nIndians) would bring us out to a settlement.\r\n\r\n\"This is certain that at this time I was going on, falling and getting\r\nup again, on account of my needs, but my faith was always strong and\r\nfirm that our Lady of the Apparition was going to bring us out safely.\r\nAt the end of the said four days of following the _Batche_ or broken\r\nbranches, in such different directions, for sometimes they went to the\r\nEast, at other times to the North, and at others to the South, we\r\nfinally came across a path, broad and good, on which it was evident\r\nthat a little while before Indians had passed and that there was\r\nfrequent passing. The Indians wished to follow it towards the East, in\r\ncase there were (as there were, from what I knew afterwards) any farms\r\nthere, in which they might find something to sustain ourselves. But I\r\ndid not let them go, since the sure thing was to follow it to the West,\r\nwhere either a settlement or the road from Guatemala, which we were\r\nsearching for, could not fail us. At this time we were going on with a\r\nstrong desire to reach it, but with little courage; wherefore we\r\nstopped to sleep on the road.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThey Climb Some High Hills. \"On the next day we went on over some high\r\nhills, difficult to climb; then, on passing over one which is ascended\r\non the bank of a stream with but little water in it, one of the two\r\nIndians who accompanied me carried me, so that I could pass over it or\r\nclimb it. There was no need for the hill to be very high (and it was\r\nnot) for me not to be able to climb it, since now there was left to me\r\nin all my body only the bones and the skin and the spirit which\r\nanimated them. In a little while I gave up at once, without being able\r\nto take a step forward, although my wish was to go on and the Indians\r\nencouraged me. This was a thing which gave them great trouble, for they\r\nalso now were reeling from weakness. I, seeing that they would be\r\nmissed more, if they died than if I did, since they had families of\r\nwife, children, mother and brother, and that I had only God, to whom I\r\nhad delivered my soul and life, I made an agreement with them, that\r\nthey should leave me there under a tree, and that they should try to\r\nsave their lives, with the understanding that, if they got out in a\r\nshort time to a settlement, they should come back to see me in a few\r\ndays and to bring me some aid, for if I did not follow them, it was not\r\nfrom want of wish or spirit to do so, but from want of strength. They\r\ngrieved much over this resolution of mine, on account of the love which\r\nthey had come to have for me, and so they replied to me that they were\r\nnot going to leave me, but that where I should die, they were going to\r\ndie also. I (perhaps by divine inspiration) insisted that they should\r\ngo on and leave me, to the point of commanding them with firmness to do\r\nso, provided that they should come to see me, whenever they found\r\nsupplies, for I trusted in God that they would find me alive. With this\r\ndetermination of mine, they obeyed me, cutting off as they could leaves\r\nor branches of palms, and they made me a little hut in which to remain\r\nat rest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAvendano Left Alone. \"At the same time they left me a fire lighted, and\r\nit was a prodigy for them to have lighted it, since on other occasions\r\nthey had not been able to make a fire, because they lacked strength in\r\ntheir hands to prepare or bore the said sticks with which fire is made.\r\nThey also left me half a gourd of water to cool my throat, so that it\r\nmight not be closed up. Having done all this with great tenderness and\r\nwith tears, they took leave of me, and I, giving them my benediction,\r\nand showing them a like tenderness, embraced them also and sent them\r\naway, asking my most holy Mother of the Apparition to take them shortly\r\nand safely.\r\n\r\n\"I then as one who remained to die, without knowing whether the Indians\r\nwould come back or not, endeavored to prepare myself with a _santo\r\nchristo_ which I had with me, consoling myself with it, as one who had\r\nno other company and needed the _santo christo_ so much in that time of\r\ntrial. With it I conversed and I accused myself of all my faults before\r\nit, as one who could pardon them. Having finished reciting the divine\r\nservice, I got ready to bless a little roll of paper which I had, so\r\nas, on seeing that I was failing, to burn it; in the fire, which was at\r\nmy side. At once I read the prayers for the dying with the litanies,\r\netc., after which I returned to my conversations with the _santo\r\nchristo_, which finished, I recited a vigil, celebrating my burial.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Miracle of the Sapote. \"I was engaged in these exercises, when\r\nsuddenly, though there were no _sapote_ trees where I was, there came a\r\nsquirrel down a low tree, with a _sapote_ in his little paws, and\r\ngiving two jumps in my presence, it showed its little teeth and went\r\naway. I was not able to stir, but with a little stick which was at my\r\nside, I drew this _sapote_ to me and ate it, for it was as ripe and\r\nsweet as honey. The wonder is that in thousands of _sapotes_ which we\r\nfound in these forests, we did not come across a single good piece of\r\none; and here without there being a tree, that little animal brought a\r\nripe one. I knew then that God sent me that aid, like another Saint\r\nPaul, although I was very far from imitating him in his virtues, but\r\nrather that God might show his greater mercy to such a great sinner as\r\nI. I gave him thanks with some tenderness for such a kindness, hoping\r\nwith more confidence now that I should not die of hunger. In doing this\r\nand saying my prayers, I passed the whole day and night, awaiting every\r\nmoment the hour of dawn.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRescued. \"Much neglected by human aid (and even forgotten) was I, when\r\nit dawned the next day, since in six or eight days at the least, I did\r\nnot expect any result from the two Indians whom I had sent off. I\r\nrested in this supposition as soon as it dawned and I gave thanks to\r\nGod for having brought me safely through that night, etc. I set about\r\nreciting the divine service, which I never failed to recite in these\r\nforests, nor was it ever absent from my mind, when suddenly I heard a\r\nnoise of people, and on turning my eyes, I saw some ten Indians of the\r\ntown of Mani and its suburbs, who came to get me. I did not take them\r\nfor men, but for angels, and as such they acted in my case in\r\neverything. Scarcely had they come to where I was, when with great\r\naffection they ran to embrace me, shedding plenty of tears, and at the\r\nsame time, saying a thousand tender words to me. I could not restrain\r\nmyself at this kindness, when I thought also of such an unexpected\r\nblessing as God had shown me. On the other hand it caused me to feel\r\nmore kindly, when I saw that a people as impious as the Indians\r\nnaturally are, should be so merciful to me, as never have I seen such a\r\nthing in them.\r\n\r\n\"They brought me a little meal that they eat, and in a moment they\r\nwarmed it so that I could drink it, they supporting me, one on one side\r\nand one on the other, so that I might keep seated. They revived the\r\nfire which was there, and warming up six cloaks very nicely, they\r\nwrapped me up in them, and warmed my extremities, that is, my feet and\r\nhands, since they were numb from weakness and cold air; I recovered by\r\nmeans of that warmth and food which I drank, and in order to raise me,\r\nthey held aloft my whole body, stiff as if it was a sculptured statue.\r\nThey brought a hammock in which they took me to the town of Chuntuci,\r\nfrom which I set out when I went among the said Ytzaes, and to which\r\nthe said Indians who carried me were loading up to go.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat had Happened to the Indians whom Avendano Sent off. \"Portentous\r\nsurely was the present event, if all the circumstances are considered.\r\nThe two Indians left my presence, whom I sent off against their will,\r\nso as to save their lives, forcing them to leave me alone. Everything\r\nhappened through a higher direction,--first since the said Indians went\r\non falling and getting up again, from their want of strength, and in\r\nspite of all this, they followed the path which led from where they\r\nleft me up to the town of Chuntuci, which they reached in an hour and a\r\nhalf, for they only stopped long enough to take some refreshment with\r\nthe said carriers, and to tell them how I was left to die in the\r\nforest. Scarcely had they heard this, when without any delay, they\r\nstarted out to come and get me, and the distance which it took my two\r\nIndians to go in an hour and a half, the said carriers had to take a\r\nday and a half in finding me, without their losing their road, by which\r\nthe miracle can easily be understood. Secondly, that my Indians, coming\r\nto Chuntuci, and meeting these carriers loading, was all one (i.e.,\r\nsimultaneous), so that if they had stopped even a little, they would\r\nnot have met them, and consequently would not have found supplies to\r\nbring to me, and even less should I have been able to start out for a\r\nsettlement. Therefore the hurry which I showed in sending them away was\r\nby divine direction. They took me in the said hammock, and though it\r\nwas a convenience on account of the rest that it gave, it was also some\r\naffliction to me, since, although they wrapped me up very well in their\r\ncloaks, every little while it gave me cramps in all my body, I being\r\nstiff and cold from head to foot. At which they warmed the cloaks\r\nagain, and rubbing my hands and feet with them all warm, the muscles\r\nagain were stretched, although it lasted but a short time. At last I\r\nreached the town of Chuntuci, on the Sunday of Septuagesima, which\r\nwas on the 19th of February, in this year of sixteen hundred and\r\nninety-six, about three o'clock in the afternoon,--a result surely very\r\ndifferent from what I thought,--that I should ever be in the said town\r\nagain, after the extremity to which I had come. All that afternoon I\r\nstayed looking at this town, and I did not believe yet that I was\r\nreally there. Blessed be the mercy of God, who showed it thus in my\r\ncase. For his divine Majesty alone, of his own accord, could show such\r\ncompassion on this miserable sinner. Infinite thanks be given for so\r\ngreat blessings as he gave me, and may his divine Majesty so will, that\r\nit redound to his honor and glory through infinite centuries of\r\ncenturies. Amen. The Indian carriers continued in their pious work of\r\nconveying me and of caring for my Indian singers, so that both in them\r\nand in me, a great change of condition resulted from the fresh food,\r\nwhich put us on the road to life.\"\r\n\r\nAvendano set out shortly afterwards for Merida.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Messenger from Tayasal. When he and his companions reached Merida\r\nthey were told of the arrival of a messenger from Canek of Tayasal.\r\nThis messenger had reached Merida considerably before the time at which\r\nthe Padres left Tayasal. He had been received by the Governor and\r\nsociety of Merida with great rejoicings because of the fact that he\r\nannounced that his errand was to proffer the allegiance of Canek and\r\nall his subjects, some eighty thousand Indians in all.\r\n\r\n\r\nReasons for Avendano's Distrust. Avendano found it difficult to credit\r\nthis news for several reasons, the chief of which were:\r\n\r\nFirst. The obvious fact that, at the time he (Avendano) was last at\r\nTayasal, Canek was unable to force his subjects to adopt Christianity\r\non account of the hostility of Covoh and others.\r\n\r\nSecond. That, in spite of the intimacy that had existed between Canek\r\nand Avendano, the latter had never received the slightest hint of\r\nCanek's intention of sending any such messenger.\r\n\r\nThird. That Canek, had such a messenger really been sent while the\r\nPadres were with him, would most certainly have detained them as\r\nhostages until the safe return of the messenger.\r\n\r\nAvendano (p. 66 recto) closes his narrative thus:\r\n\r\n\"I omit, so as not to cause annoyance, many other effective reasons,\r\nwhich I could give, but I leave it to the consideration of any one who\r\nshould reflect on this matter, better than I. As for me, who saw and\r\nwas in touch with it all, I am satisfied with what I have said. And, in\r\nreference to the common opinion of all the Province, I say that the\r\nlarge part of it is of the opinion that the said message was false....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n              THE CONSUMMATION OF THE CONQUEST OF TAYASAL\r\n                      BY THE SPANIARDS, 1695-1696\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Expedition from Guatemala Reaches Cahabon. It will be remembered\r\nthat Fray Alonso Cano, the Augustine friar who had accompanied the\r\nfirst, and unsuccessful, entrada from Guatemala, had returned to that\r\ncity in the autumn of 1695. He remained there until December of that\r\nsame year, when he set out once more for the north, reaching Cahabon in\r\nJanuary, 1696. There Cano and his companions awaited the arrival of\r\nDoctor Don Bartholome de Amezquita, who, in his capacity of Oidor and\r\nAlcalde Ordinario of the Audiencia of Guatemala, was to lead the\r\nexpedition. Amezquita arrived early in February, and with him came\r\nCaptain Juan Diaz de Velasco. They found Cahabon in a bad condition on\r\naccount of the lack of preparations and because of the heavy rains.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreliminary Movements and Plans. In order to appease the zeal of those\r\nwho were urging that the expedition proceed with all speed, it was\r\ndecided that Captain Diaz de Velasco should go ahead of the main body\r\nof troops. He took with him seventy soldiers and thirty Indians; Cano\r\nwent with him. Guided by the Itza named Cuixam or Cuixan, Diaz de\r\nVelasco set forth from Mopan (whither the force had moved) on March 7.\r\nIt was arranged that, from a place called Yxbol, near Tayasal, Cuixam\r\nwas to be sent on to ascertain Canek's attitude, and that the Captain,\r\nDiaz de Velasco, and his men were to wait for him. On the tenth of\r\nMarch, Amezquita and Cano left Mopan. They kept receiving letters and\r\nmessages from those ahead until they reached the Chacal River, where\r\nall traces of their vanguard completely vanished.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fate of Diaz de Velasco; Amezquita Follows him. The reason for this\r\ncessation of communication was briefly as follows: Captain Diaz de\r\nVelasco sent Cuixam ahead, as had been planned, to Tayasal. Cuixam\r\nreported that two Franciscans were on the island. The Captain would not\r\nbelieve this. Still, he was so bold as to embark in a canoe rowed by\r\nnatives, who, as soon as the vessel was clear of the shore, began a\r\nsharp struggle which resulted in the death of all the Spaniards in\r\nthe party. In due course Amezquita followed in the footsteps of the\r\nill-fated Captain. On arriving at the shores of the lake he learned the\r\nfate that had befallen Diaz de Velasco. Seeing that there was nothing\r\nhe could do with so small a force as that which he had at his disposal,\r\nAmezquita withdrew to Chacal, and later on, by the order of Don Gabriel\r\nSanchez de Berrospe, the new President of the Audiencia of Guatemala,\r\nhe withdrew to Guatemala City.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion of the Subjection of the Itzas Begun. After the series of\r\nevents which we have just studied came to an end there was, for a time,\r\na lull in the war. Our knowledge of the incidents which followed the\r\nbreak is derived from Villagutierre y Sotomayor. (Lib. v, caps. 7, 8,\r\netc.) According to this authority, events occurred in the following\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\r\nParades is Ordered to March to Los Dolores. Ursua determined to bring\r\nmatters to a satisfactory conclusion by means of another expedition\r\ninto the Itza country. Accordingly he sent his orders to Alonso Garcia\r\nde Paredes, who, with the soldiers of that unsuccessful expedition on\r\nwhich Avendano had gone, was still in Tzucthok. In substance Paredes\r\nwas ordered to go and place himself and his men under the orders of the\r\nPresident of Guatemala or his successor. To this end he was to go south\r\nfrom Tzucthok, and always \"trying to incline his route a little toward\r\nthe left hand, or towards the east, was to place himself in sight of\r\nthe town of Lacandones, which the President had discovered and named\r\nNuestra Senora de los Dolores.\"[10.1] Paredes was to fortify himself\r\nthere about five leagues from the town of Lacandon, and he was to stay\r\nthere without molesting the surrounding settlements. From the time of\r\nreceiving these instructions to the time when he built his stockaded\r\nredoubt he was to take especial care to inform himself concerning the\r\npeople round about, and especially those along the road which was being\r\nbuilt. On arriving in the neighborhood of Lacandon and after the\r\nfounding of the redoubt, Paredes was to go to the President so as to\r\nhand over to him the various letters that he bore and so as to place\r\nhimself under his orders. Thereafter, if circumstances permitted, he\r\nwas to go as soon as possible to the Itzas, together with a suitable\r\nnumber of Padres and soldiers. He; was ordered to subject and catechize\r\nthe natives.\r\n\r\nParedes appointed as officers Don Joseph de Estenoz, Pedro de Zuviaur,\r\nJoseph Laynez, and Mateo Hidalgo, who had been picked out by Ursua for\r\ntheir various posts. From this point on we have the account of Avendano\r\nto rely upon until after the Padre's withdrawal to Merida. An uprising\r\non the part of the Cacique Covoh, as we know, was the immediate cause\r\nof the retirement. It did not have, however, a permanently discouraging\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanek's Ambassador, Can, Arrives at Merida. In the last third of\r\nDecember, 1695, while Avendano was still in the wilderness, an\r\nambassador named Can arrived at Merida from Canek.[10.2] He was\r\naccompanied by three kinsmen of his, together with some Muzules\r\nIndians. Ursua himself came out to meet him with a great following. The\r\nparties met at the convent of the Mejorada; thence the embassy was\r\ntaken to the cathedral and to the palace. Can then said that his uncle,\r\nCanek, asked for Padres so that Christianity might be introduced among\r\nthe Itzas. A suitable reply was given, and the ambassador was baptized.\r\n(Villagutierre, lib. vi, caps. 3-5.) Can told Ursua that his uncle,\r\nCanek, had four Kings under him who were his vassals. They were Citcan,\r\nAhamatan, Ahkin, and Ahitcan, as well as Ahatsi. Can was baptized\r\nMartin Francisco Can and his brother Miguel Can. Finally, after many\r\nceremonies and solemn masses, Ursua sent them home with much good\r\nfeeling. An escort headed by Captain Francisco de Hariza or Ariza of\r\nBacalar set forth for the Itzas. Ursua sent word of all these\r\ndevelopments to Paredes, ordering him, as well as Hariza, to do all\r\nthat was necessary for the winning or conquering of Canek and his\r\nvassals.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the new President of Guatemala, Escals, was taking all\r\npossible precautions for the furtherance of the design. His division of\r\nthe expedition, of which Fray Agustin Cano was a part, left Guatemala\r\nin January, 1696. There is no need to tell again what happened, as Cano\r\nhas already told us all up to a certain point.\r\n\r\n\r\nZuviaur Goes to the Lake. The early weeks of 1696, then, were spent by\r\nAvendano and the men of Yucatan in Peten and in the wilderness between\r\nit and Tipu, to which the Padres were enabled to flee by Canek, who\r\nknew well the plots that were being hatched against them by Covoh and\r\nby Canek's wife.\r\n\r\nShortly after Avendano reached Merida and made his report, Ursua\r\ndispatched Captain Don Pedro de Zuviaur with seventy men, enough\r\nIndians, and Padre Juan San Buenaventura to the lake by way of the\r\nroute so lately followed by Avendano. The Itzas received them armed for\r\nwar. Padre San Buenaventura, however, partly calmed them by smooth\r\nwords; fighting did not, however, entirely cease, and before long\r\nZuviaur returned to the royal camp. At about the same time an Indian\r\nmessenger arrived from Hariza, who was in the neighborhood of Tipu,\r\nwith the information that the Franciscans who were administering the\r\nvillages along the road were meeting with a fair measure of success,\r\nand that the Itzas were the only remaining obstacle to the completion\r\nof the undertaking. Hourly they became more threatening and more\r\ndangerous. Several skirmishes took place between them and the men of\r\nParedes. Finally, forced by lack of supplies, Paredes withdrew with all\r\nhis men into the province.\r\n\r\n\r\nUrsua Determines to Take Vigorous Measures. Clearly enough, in Ursua's\r\nopinion, things were far from being in a satisfactory condition. He\r\nmade up his mind that a stop must be put to the menace of the Itzas at\r\nall costs, and he determined to go in person upon this definitive\r\nexpedition. He made especially elaborate and adequate preparations,\r\ndoing things which should have been done long before. He assembled a\r\nsufficient number of carpenters to build brigantines and _pyraguas_ on\r\nthe shore of the lake, and he got together ample stores. Nothing was\r\nsaid of all this to the King of Castile, as it was notorious that he\r\nwould have frowned upon such military preparations.\r\n\r\n\r\nLawsuits between Soberanis and Ursua. At this time the old enmity\r\nbetween Soberanis and Ursua reawakened. Soberanis was at the viceregal\r\ncourt, where, during the reign of the Conde de Galve, he opposed\r\nUrsua's interests and plans with some success. Galve was succeeded,\r\nhowever, by Don Juan de Ortega Montanes, Bishop of Michoacan, who was\r\nappointed Viceroy _ad interim_ of Mexico. Ortega, being a broad-minded\r\nman, could see the good of the wishes of both sides, and he determined\r\nthat the whole matter should be laid before the Council of the Indies.\r\nThe result was a long lawsuit, during which it became clear that\r\nSoberanis wished for more territory for his King, while Ursua wanted\r\nmore vassals. A series of lawsuits, stained by false charges, perjury,\r\nand petty recriminations (mostly on the part of Soberanis and his\r\nparty), followed. It is a matter which is very involved and for us\r\nunimportant, as it did not alter the current of events in the region of\r\nTayasal.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Parades at Tzucthok. While these lawsuits were dragging on,\r\nCaptain Alonso Garcia de Paredes arrived at the bank of the large river\r\n(Nohukum?). After building a _pyragua_ he and twenty men embarked on it\r\nand went up the river to its source, where they captured ten canoes.\r\nSoon after they returned to Tzucthok on account of the rainy season.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Hariza at Tipu. Meanwhile Can, with Captain Francisco de Hariza\r\nand an escort of thirty soldiers, had returned to Tipu from Merida. At\r\nthe former place they learned how Paredes had sent soldiers to the lake\r\nunder Zuviaur, how some had been taken prisoners there and put to\r\ndeath, and how the Gran Cayo and its islands were devastated because\r\nthe Indians had wished to kill their King Canek on account of his\r\nfriendly attitude toward the Spaniards. In the trial of one Pablo Gil\r\nof Salamanca, who at this time was accused of conspiracy, it came out\r\nthat this revolution at Peten had occurred soon after the departure of\r\nCan for Merida. The _zamaguales_ or common people were incensed with\r\nCanek because he had sent his nephew to Yucatan. When Can returned to\r\nPeten he found that his uncle was still in power but not entirely\r\nsecure. Can was unable to return to his own village eight leagues away\r\nbecause it was subject to Cintanek, who was at war with Canek.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cacique Cintanek's Villages. The five villages of Cintanek were\r\nChaltuna, Sac peten, Maconche, Saca, and Coba. The nine villages\r\nsubject, at this time, to Canek were Oraptun, Zacpui, Chee, Chacha,\r\nSacfinil, Linil, Oboncox, Chulul, and Eckixil. (Cf. Villagutierre, p.\r\n435.) The people in these villages were very numerous; they knew\r\nnothing of the Kingdom of Guatemala beyond the fact that some five\r\nleagues away was a place called Mopan.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan's Report. The Indians, Can and others, related how fifteen Spanish\r\nmen came to the Indians of the Gran Cayo and asked for provisions,\r\nwhich were brought to them. (These Spaniards were, no doubt, a party\r\nsent out by Paredes just before he withdrew.) Even as they were eating,\r\nmusket shots were heard on the shore. At once those who were eating on\r\nthe island judged their companions were in danger and hastily armed\r\nthemselves. A fight quickly took place, and the Spaniards even attacked\r\nthe person of Canek himself. At length, however, the Spaniards fled.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commands of King Charles II. At last the letters and reports which,\r\nat the insistence of Ortega Montanes, the Viceroy Bishop, had been sent\r\nto the court of Spain earlier in the year, bore fruit, for the King\r\nsent new dispatches ordering Don Martin thus: acknowledgment was made\r\nof the good work done by Sargento Mayor, Don Martin de Ursua y\r\nArizmendi, as well as of that done by Captain Alonso Garcia de Paredes,\r\nCaptain Joseph Fernandez de Estenoz, and others. Don Roque de Soberanis\r\ny Centeno was ordered to give all possible assistance to Ursua and to\r\nrefrain from hindering him in any way. The cedulas were signed at Buen\r\nRetiro on May 29, 1696. These dispatches, together with a commendatory\r\nletter from the Conde de Adanero, President of the Council of the\r\nIndies, arrived in Yucatan late in 1696. Fortunately Ursua had already\r\nmade all his preparations for the next campaign. Don Martin sent copies\r\nof the cedulas and letter to the newly arrived Viceroy of Mexico, the\r\nConde de Moctezuma, to the Audience of Guatemala, and to the\r\nReverendissimo Don Fray Antonio de Arriaga, Bishop of Yucatan.\r\n\r\nBefore setting out there was one more formality to go through. Ursua\r\ntherefore sent the orders of the King to Don Roque, asking him at the\r\nsame time for certain aid. (Villagutierre, lib. viii, cap. 2.)\r\nStraightway Don Roque sent Don Juan Geronimo de Abad to Campeche to\r\ninform Ursua that Soberanis would give him all necessary aid for the\r\nfulfilment of the royal will. He also ordered Ursua to pick out those\r\npersons whom he thought ought to be captains, and Don Roque promised to\r\nconfirm the appointments.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoberanis and Ursua in Agreement at Last. Abad executed his errand and\r\nDon Martin replied that only the very numerous infidel Indians of the\r\nLaguna del Itza stood between him and the successful completion of the\r\nroad, which was already open on the north almost as far as the lake and\r\non the south as far as Cahabon. The intervening region contained the\r\nItzas, whom Ursua purposed to conquer. He had already chosen as\r\ncaptains Alonso Garcia de Paredes, Joseph Fernandez de Estenoz, Pedro\r\nde Zuviaur, and Roque Gutierrez. At the same time Don Martin informed\r\nAbad that he had prepared all sorts of supplies and munitions, and he\r\nbegged Don Roque de Soberanis to furnish him with advice as to the\r\nproper payment for various things. Don Roque approved of everything\r\nthat Don Martin proposed, and he ordered that Abad, together with a\r\nscrivener and an interpreter, should see to the proper financial\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Part to be Taken by Indian Villages. Ursua then asked that the\r\nmountain villages of Tecax and Oxcuscab should be made to supply\r\nservice Indians. These, if granted, were to be under the orders of the\r\ncaptain of Tecax; but Soberanis pointed out that those villages had\r\nalready done their share, and so he ordered that the Caciques of\r\nZotuta, Yaxcava, Tixcacal, and Peto should furnish the needed labor.\r\nThe part each was to take was as follows:\r\n\r\n      Zotuta    16 mules; 16 arrieros; 16 other Indians\r\n      Yaxcava   12   \"    12     \"     12   \"      \"\r\n      Tixcacal  12   \"    12     \"     12   \"      \"\r\n      Peto      20   \"    20     \"     20   \"      \"\r\n\r\nAll these Indians were to be in charge of Don Juan del Castillo,\r\ncaptain of Tecax. Indians from Mani were to carry the supplies.\r\n\r\nOn January 23, 1697, Don Martin de Ursua set forth from Campeche after\r\ngiving thanks for aid received. On arriving at Tzucthok they took the\r\nsame road as on previous occasions. They camped at length two leagues\r\nfrom the lake, having passed through Batcab. On the way south they\r\nlearned that the cacique of Tzucthok and some of the Indians of that\r\nvillage had retired to such places as Apelchen, Bolonchen, Chabuhic,\r\nand Sacauchen. Some of the Chanes, however, remained faithful, for\r\nwhich Ursua rewarded them with presents. At about this time also,\r\nalthough Ursua probably did not know of it, Berrospe had ordered the\r\ntroops of Guatemala to withdraw definitely from Mopan and other places.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Road Completed as Far as the Lake. At the end of February and in\r\nearly March the two leagues of road between the camp and the lake were\r\ncompleted. _Pyraguas_ had already been built and were finished by the\r\ntime the army encamped on the lake shore. Seeing such a display of\r\npower, the Indians tried to rival it, but when they saw the galley and\r\n_pyraguas_ they retired to their island. There were sundry attempts to\r\nmake friends with the Indians, but they showed themselves utterly\r\nundeserving of confidence. On March 10, 1697, Don Martin Can, he who\r\nhad gone to Merida as ambassador for his uncle Canek and who was godson\r\nof Ursua, hearing of the latter's arrival, came to him joyfully. As a\r\nresult of this the murmurs to the effect that he was a myth entirely\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nSome squads of Indians approached the camp by land with arms. The\r\ngeneral soon saw it was but a pugnacious attempt to force the Spaniards\r\ninto a skirmish. At the same moment a large canoe beached on the shore\r\nwhere the camp was. Can said that those in it were Chamaxculu and other\r\nimportant Indians from Alain. They were received with all possible\r\ncordiality, and some of the Indians were found to be those who had been\r\nin Merida with Can. Chamaxculu was an old man of seventy years.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuincanek Feigns Friendliness. Very soon after that Quincanek visited\r\nthe camp. He was cordially welcomed and in conversation he promised to\r\naid the opening of the road. Ursua discreetly decided it would be\r\nsuperfluous to make any allusion at that time to the idolatry,\r\ntreachery, and other foibles of the Itzas. Everything seemed serene and\r\namicable. The chiefs promised to return for dinner later.\r\n\r\nThey remained where they were from March 10 to 12, 1697. During those\r\nthree days many Indian women came in canoes and unattended from Peten\r\nto the camp. Whether their purpose was to get themselves violated and\r\nthereby furnish an excuse to the lurking squads of Indians to attack\r\nthe Spaniards, or whether they were led by mere curiosity, is not\r\nabsolutely certain; but it is probable that the former was the case,\r\nfor when, through good discipline, Ursua managed to restrain his men,\r\nthe women made all sorts of obscene gestures to attract the soldiers,\r\nbut to no purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hostilities Begin. Finally the day arrived on which, according to\r\nhis promise, Quincanek, was to bring Canek to dinner with Ursua. But\r\ninstead of a peaceful Canek and Quincanek coming to have dinner with\r\nthem, the Spaniards saw a huge fleet of canoes all decked out in\r\nwarlike array approaching them. This, however, did not greatly dismay\r\nthe Spaniards, as they knew that their own galley and _pyraguas_, which\r\nwere all in readiness, would give them an immense advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Captains Urge Ursua to Fight; the Battle. Ursua called a council of\r\nwar in which Paredes, Estenoz, Zuviaur, and all the other captains\r\nurged him to use force and thereby to conquer the Itzas finally. Ursua\r\nwas still determined, however, to maintain peace as long as possible,\r\nbeing mindful of the King's wish.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, March 13, 1697, Ursua determined to go to the\r\nPeten Grande, which lay two leagues from his camp. Leaving a good\r\ngarrison in the camp, he took two hundred men and Don Martin Can in the\r\nboats and sailed for Peten. Before long the Spaniards, who were under\r\nthe strictest orders not to fire, were surrounded by a large fleet of\r\ncanoes filled with Itzas, who shot arrows at the invaders. As one would\r\nnaturally expect, all attempts to reason with the outraged Itzas proved\r\nfutile. Finally one Bartolome Duran, maddened by an arrow wound, fired\r\noff his gun. This precipitated a hot skirmish in which everyone took\r\npart. At the end of it the Spaniards got upon the shore, and by means\r\nof the artillery at length put the Itzas to flight. The latter fled\r\naway as fast as they could by swimming, and when in due time Ursua and\r\nhis men got to Peten Grande, they found nothing but old women and\r\nlittle children there. All who could had fled into and across the lake\r\nrather than face the vengeance of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n\r\nTayasal Becomes a Spanish Possession. The battle was over by eight in\r\nthe morning. The standard of Jesus Christ was set up; the royal arms\r\nwere engraved over the door of what had been the principal temple; and\r\nthanks were given to God for the victory. A church was founded and the\r\nhouses of the idols were cleaned out. Oddly enough the temple where\r\nCanek and his idolatrous priests had once torn out human hearts was\r\nchosen as the Christians' place of worship.\r\n\r\nThus ends the history of the long, brave but fruitless struggle of the\r\nItzas against the Spanish conquerors. After so many romantic interests\r\nit is but natural that any account of subsequent events should be an\r\nanti-climax. The later history of the Itza country can be dismissed in\r\na word.\r\n\r\n\r\nLater History of Tayasal. Since the conquest, Tayasal has been a mere\r\nSpanish provincial village with nothing to distinguish it from scores\r\nof others. In the first half of the nineteenth century serious\r\ninsurrections took place in the region. At about the same period the\r\nname Tayasal was taken away and Flores was substituted, in honor of one\r\nCyrilo Flores, a local patriot. It is a pity that the old, unusual, and\r\neuphonious name was not kept. At present Flores (Pl. III) is the\r\ncapital of the Department of Peten, Guatemala.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX I\r\n\r\n                      THE QUESTION OF ORTHOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nPossibly the reader has noted in these pages a tendency toward\r\ninconsistency in the matter of spelling proper names.

I decided that it would be worth while to try and compile a\r\nlist of all the early maps of Yucatan. It would be folly for me to\r\nclaim that the list I give here is complete; it is, however, at least\r\nas complete as any such list now existing. No attempt has been made to\r\nlist all the modern maps of the area; neither has there been any\r\nattempt to include maps of limited portions of the peninsula. A\r\nselection from the immense amount of material given by Pedro Torres\r\nLanzas has, however, been made, and the notes made by Dr. Tozzer in\r\nSeville are appended.\r\n\r\n\r\n             THE MAPS OF YUCATAN ARRANGED IN CHRONOLOGICAL\r\n                                 ORDER\r\n\r\n1502 ?      PORTUGUESE.\r\n        Valentini (1898, 1902) refers to this map as being dated either\r\n      in 1493 or 1502. There is little doubt that this map is misdated\r\n      for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n        1. The information contained in the map is so full that it\r\n      cannot have been earlier than 1520.\r\n\r\n        2. The nomenclature is mainly \"sailor names\" and therefore\r\n      inconclusive.\r\n\r\n        3. The alleged Yucatan runs from its nearest point to Cuba\r\n      northwardly, not southwardly. It is my belief that the peninsula\r\n      in question is meant for Florida, and that it is too far west.\r\n\r\n        4. The whole style of the map is comparable to that of the\r\n      following well-known ones: Turin-Spanish, 1523-25;\r\n      Wolfenbuettel-Spanish, 1525-30; Maggiolo, 1527; Verrazano, 1529;\r\n      Weimar-Spanish, 1527. It is for more full and accurate than\r\n      Maggiolo, 1519. Therefore it cannot date from before 1520, and\r\n      probably not from before 1525.\r\n\r\nca. 1501-02 RICHARD KING PORTOLAN (Hamy Coll.).\r\n        Has Cuba and other West Indies, also eastern portions of South\r\n      America, neither Mexico nor Yucatan.\r\n\r\n1502-04 CANTINO (Stevenson, 1903).\r\n        Has Cuba, etc. No Mexico and Yucatan.\r\n\r\n1507  WALDSEEMUeLLER.\r\n        America first so called.

It appears in the original MS. of Bishop Landa's famous\r\n      work. The remarks as to distances, in the southwest corner, are,\r\n      of course, entirely erroneous. Also it should be noted that\r\n      Cozumel (i.e., Cuzmil) and Las Mujeres are placed on the wrong\r\n      side of the peninsula. One of the most interesting points about\r\n      the map is that it gives Mani as \"The city of the King.\" This is\r\n      undoubtedly a reference to the Tutul Xius whom we have mentioned\r\n      in the body of this book.\r\n\r\n1566? LANDA (see Plate V).\r\n        This smaller map is much like the foregoing one. But it fails\r\n      to include such place names as Ychpa, Chicheniza, Mani, and so\r\n      on. At the same time a slight improvement is to be noted in the\r\n      location of Cozumel, though one is at a loss to account for the\r\n      placing of Cape Catoch.[A3.3]\r\n\r\n1570  ORTELIUS, THEATRUM ORBIS TERRARUM.\r\n        Shows Yucatan as a peninsula; calls Merida Atalaria, Cozumel\r\n      Acasumal, etc.\r\n\r\n1572  THOMASO PORCACCHI DA CASTIGLIONE, VENICE.\r\n        Has Yucatan as a peninsula.\r\n\r\n1576  ANOTHER EDITION OF PORCCACHI DA CASTIGLIONE.\r\n\r\n1581  PLANO DEL PUEBLO DE MUTUL, EN LA PROVINCIA DE YUCATAN, TERMINOS\r\n          DE LA CIUDAD DE MERIDA.

PAN AMERICAN UNION, 1915.\r\n        Also a very trustworthy map.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing list of maps the following interesting points are to\r\nbe gleaned:\r\n\r\n1. Yucatan does not appear on any map prior to 1523-1525. From the time\r\nof its first discovery Yucatan was believed to be an island. Maps vary\r\ngreatly as to what sort of an island it was.\r\n\r\n2. In 1527 the Weimar-Spanish map shows Yucatan for the first time as a\r\npeninsula. Probably the maker of this map derived his information from\r\nsomeone who had been with Cortes in 1524-1525. The name Ytza appears on\r\nthe isthmus; it is so faint as to be almost illegible, but I think I\r\nhave deciphered it correctly.\r\n\r\n3. From 1529 (Ribero) to 1548 (Venice \"Ptolemy\") geographical knowledge\r\nof Yucatan falls off badly. With only two exceptions (Mercator, 1536,\r\nand Santa Cruz, 1542) the maps of this period show Yucatan as an island\r\nmore or less remote from the mainland. I think that the comparative\r\naccuracy of Alonso de Santa Cruz is accounted for by the fact that he\r\nwas official cartographer to the crown of Castile and that he had\r\nofficial information of Montejo's explorations, 1526-1541.\r\n\r\n4. From 1551 onward Yucatan is usually shown as a peninsula; but even\r\nso late as this there are exceptions such as Ferrando Berteli, 1560,\r\nand Gulielmus Nicolai, 1603, whose inaccuracies are many.\r\n\r\n5. In Sanson d'Abbeville, 1656, the Itzas appear again, this time under\r\nthe name of Yzues. They and the Cocomes are misplaced, being too far\r\nnorth. It is barely possible that the entradas of Fuensalida and Orbita\r\nand Delgado, 1618-1624, may have had some influence on this map.\r\n\r\n6. In Blaauw, 1667, we have the first step toward a really accurate map\r\nof Yucatan. This map bears many place names, among them the Yzaes and\r\nthe Cocomes.\r\n\r\n7. About 1714 Henry Popple, the great London map maker, made an\r\nexcellent map of the region. On it Lake Peten is rightly located. There\r\ncan be but little doubt that Popple derived his information from the\r\nEnglish in British Honduras. Through them he probably learned of the\r\nconquest of the Itzas. It is not impossible, of course, that he was\r\nalso acquainted with the writings of Cogolludo and Villagutierre, but\r\nthat does not seem very likely. From that time onward the Itzas have\r\nappeared regularly on the maps of that region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPENDIX IV\r\n\r\n                  ITINERARY OF AVENDANO, TOGETHER WITH\r\n                        GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\n                             (See Plate VI)\r\n\r\n                   First Trip June to September, 1695\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 3, 1695   Left MERIDA.\r\n\r\nJune 11        CANICH, CAUICH, BOLENCHEN, BOLONCHEN CAUICH, OR\r\n                 BOLONCHENTICUL, CAVICH.\r\n\r\n                 This name has several variations.

The map is intended to show the Entradas of Cortez (1524-1525),\r\nFuensalida and Orbita (1618), Gallegos and Delgado (1675), President\r\nBarrios (1694-1695), Padre Cano (1695), and Padre Andres de Avendano\r\ny Loyola (1695, 1696).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n                               Chapter I.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Bowditch (1901, p. 137) says that the earliest date at\r\nQuirigua is that on Stela C: 9.1.0.0.0. and that the latest is that on\r\nStela K: 9.18.15.0.0. According to his reckoning these dates correspond\r\napproximately to 75 B.C. and 275 A.D. respectively. Mr. Bowditch\r\ninforms us that other cities in the south show similar dates, and at\r\nthe same time he points out that it is possible that these cities were\r\noccupied beyond the latest dates shown on the stelae. We see, then,\r\nthat the difference between Mr. Bowditch's computation and that of Mr.\r\nMorley rests solely in this: according to Mr. Bowditch the Golden Age\r\nor Old Empire had its beginnings as far back as 75 B.C.; Mr. Morley, on\r\nthe other hand, believes that up to 200 A.D. there was a wholly\r\nindefinite Migratory period which led up to the Golden Age and to the\r\nColonization period (that is, to 700 A.D.). From 700 onward the two\r\nsystems are the same. Whatever divergence exists between Mr. Bowditch\r\nand Mr. Morley on the subject of chronology concerns only the Golden\r\nAge or Old Empire cities.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Nakum was first studied scientifically by Count Maurice de\r\nPerigny (1908). Its importance is exceeded, however, by that of Tikal,\r\nwhich, in addition to being very near Lake Peten, is now well known.\r\nDescriptions of this elaborate group of ruins are to be found in\r\nCharnay (1887), Maudslay (1883), and in other earlier writers. The most\r\nsatisfactory work on Tikal is that of Maler and Tozzer (1911). In both\r\nNakum and Tikal the buildings are excellent examples of Old Empire\r\nconstruction, having massive substructures, towering superstructures,\r\nand a mass of intricate ornamentation. The dates at Tikal range from\r\n9.2.13.0.0. to 9.15.13.0.0. (about 210-480 A.D.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: This documentary history is based on the Books of Chilan\r\nBalam. Daniel G. Brinton's translations as given in his Maya Chronicles\r\nhave been used. For bibliographical purposes the reader is referred to\r\nTozzer, 1917.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Although the terms Maya and Itza are used more or less\r\ninterchangeably, it is to be noted that there is authority for\r\nbelieving them to mean two separate races. Ancona (1878, vol. i, p. 31\r\nff.) says that the Itzas were the earlier inhabitants of Yucatan. He\r\nadds that they worshiped Itzamna and founded Itzamal, Tihoo, and\r\nChichen Itza. The Maya, on the other hand, worshiped Kukulkan, were\r\nenemies of the Itzas, and were the founders of Mayapan, Uxmal, and\r\nother cities. This distinction, though a fine one and hard to prove\r\ncorrect, deserves to be noted.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: This name, Cocom, will be brought to our attention later\r\non, and it will be advisable for us to compare now the exceedingly\r\nconfusing accounts of what the Cocom family was.\r\n\r\nBrinton (1882, p. 165), in his introduction to the Book of Chilan Balam\r\nof Chumayel, says: \"We have no longer to do with the reckoning of the\r\nsubjects of the Xiu family who ruled at Mani, but with one which\r\nemanates from the priests of the Cocomes, who were hereditary masters\r\nof Chichen Itza.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the Chronicle of Chac Xulub Chac, by Nahau Pech, there was\r\na king named Ixcuat Cocom of Ake, who led the people of Chichen Itza\r\nfrom that place very late in their history, about eight years before\r\nthe Spaniards touched at Campeche in 1516. (Brinton, 1882, p. 218.)\r\n\r\nThe Katunes of Maya History (Valentini, 1880, pp. 54, 86) say that \"In\r\nthe 8th Ahau the Governor of Chichen Itza was deposed because he\r\nmurmured disrespectfully of Hunac-eel.\" The 8th Ahau would be about\r\n1422-1444.\r\n\r\nBrasseur de Bourbourg (1858, vol. ii, p. 35) says that the Cocomes were\r\nthe kings of Mayapan and that as they became more and more tyrannical\r\nso did the Tutul Xiu of Uxmal become more and more the champions of the\r\npeople. He suggests that Hunac-eel was a Cocom, and he also speaks of\r\nthe Lord of Chichen as being quite distinct from the Cocomes. Brasseur\r\n(cf. Lizana, 1893, p. 3) continues his account by saying that Chac Xib\r\nChac, who was then reigning in Chichen, likewise became indignant at\r\nthe cruelty of Hunac-eel (or Cocom). As a result of this seven Nahua\r\nchiefs were sent by Hunac-eel against Chac Xib Chac, whom they\r\nvanquished. With his power thus seemingly assured, Hunac-eel set about\r\noppressing his Mexican allies, who appealed for help to the Tutul Xiu\r\nof Uxmal, with the result that the dynasty of Cocom was ruined (about\r\n1440). One child of the last King of Mayapan, however, was absent at\r\nXicalanco, and he lived to set up a new Cocom kingdom at Tibulon or\r\nSotuta.\r\n\r\nMolina Solis says (1896, p. li): \"After the time of Hunac-eel, the\r\nCocomes, descendants of an ancient and rich house of the Itzaes, one of\r\nwhose members had made himself known as a man of valor in the last war,\r\nbegan to rule as lords of Mayapan. The Cocomes continued the policy of\r\ntheir predecessor....\" According to this writer it was the Cocomes who\r\ncalled in the people from Mexico, in spite of whom they were\r\noverthrown. The only survivors of the massacre of the family were a\r\nyoung son of the last king (as has been said) and a distant relative\r\nnamed Cocom Cat, who escaped to the town of Tiab. Molina's authority\r\nfor this statement is the Relacion of Juan Bote, which he quotes (p.\r\nliii). After these events the Mexican mercenaries seized the province\r\nof Canul or Ahcanul. (Landa, 1864, p. 55.) The Cheles founded a\r\nreligious state at Izamal; the Cocomes withdrew to Sotuta and the Xius\r\nto Mani. All this is accepted in the main by modern writers. (Tozzer,\r\n1907, p. 9; Falies, 1915, vol. i, p. 247 ff.)\r\n\r\nTo summarize, we may say that the Cocomes were the lords of either\r\nMayapan or Chichen Itza, though it is more likely they were identified\r\nwith the former. They became too ambitious and powerful to please the\r\nTutul Xiu of Uxmal and the ruler of Chichen; they called in Mexican\r\nmercenaries about 1200, and from then until about 1440 they became\r\nincreasingly more arrogant until, in the latter year, the Xiu and other\r\npeople who had been wronged completely destroyed the city of Mayapan,\r\nso that only two or three members of the ruling family escaped\r\ndestruction. We have now reached the crux of this whole discussion. The\r\nthree possible surviving Cocomes were; (1) the son of the last lord of\r\nMayapan; (2) the Cocom Cat, who, according to Molina (quoting an old\r\nRelacion), fled southward to Tiab at about that period; and (3) King\r\nIxcuat Cocom of Ake, who, according to Nahau Pech, also went southward,\r\nabout 1508 more or less.\r\n\r\nThere is a distinct possibility that Cocom Cat may eventually have got\r\nto Tayasal. It is likewise entirely possible to believe that from him\r\ndescended that Cocom who, with Ahchatappol and Ahauppuc, came out from\r\nTayasal to meet Padres Fuensalida and Orbita in 1618. (Villagutierre,\r\np. 116.) Sapper (1904, p. 625) tells that a Juan Pablo Cocom became the\r\nleader of an insurrection at Bacalar in May, 1848.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Seler (1908, p. 157 ff.) says that the Casa de las Monjas,\r\nthe Akat tz'ib, and the Casa Colorada all belong to this period and\r\nthat they are to be associated with the various buildings at Uxmal,\r\nKabah, Labna, and elsewhere. Rain-god masks are a striking\r\ncharacteristic of the architecture of this period.]\r\n\r\n                               Chapter II\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2.1: The question of nomenclature is a puzzling one. In\r\nAppendix I will be found a number of the almost innumerable variations\r\nof the name of Itza. The Spanish writers use both Peten and Tayasal\r\nwhen they mean the Itza stronghold. As Peten really means island, I\r\nshall use Tayasal in the future.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2.2: This is an error. The greatest length of Lake Peten runs\r\neast and west. The dimensions, like many of Avendano's distances, are\r\nmost inaccurate.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2.3: A gloss reads \"adoratorios.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2.4: A gloss reads \"mesa de piedra en cassa del rei.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2.5: This is difficult to understand, as the early Maya\r\npeoples had recorded numbers running into the millions.]\r\n\r\n                              Chapter III\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3.1: The claim of the Portuguese to have visited and mapped\r\nYucatan is not founded on historical fact. Dr. Roger Merriman of\r\nHarvard was so kind as to put at my disposal his historical information\r\non the subject of early voyages to Yucatan. It is his unqualified\r\nopinion that the map reported on by Valentini, and discussed in the\r\nlist of maps in Appendix III, is greatly misdated, being placed about\r\ntwenty to thirty years too early.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3.2: Yucatan, at this time, was thought to be an island.\r\nGrijalva named it Nuestra Senora de los Remedios. (Oviedo, 1851, vol.\r\ni, p. 508.) Soon after leaving Cozumel, Grijalva reached a small place\r\ncalled Lazaro, which figures on the map known as the Turin-Spanish of\r\n1523-1525. See Dr. Stevenson's edition, 1903.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3.3: Bernal Diaz (vol. iv, p. 284) says 100 crossbowmen and\r\nmusketeers and 22 horses. Gomara (1826, vol. ii, p. 126) says 150\r\nhorses, 160 foot-soldiers, and 3000 Indians. Cogolludo (p. 44 ff.) says\r\n130 cavalrymen, 120 musketeers, and 3000 Indians.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3.4: Cyrus Thomas (1885, pp. 171-172) once tried to prove\r\nthat Cortes visited Palenque. Apparently he thought that either\r\nIzancanac or the large town reached after that was Palenque. This\r\nbelief was proved to be erroneous by Brinton, who said (1885 a) that\r\nCortes never reached Palenque, but passed to the north of it. Maler\r\n(1901, pp. 105-106) also discusses this point.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3.5: For a description of the modern Lacandones, see Tozzer,\r\n1907.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3.6: This refers to the horse of Cortes, Morzillo, which was\r\nwounded in the foot either during the deer hunt described above or\r\nwhile crossing the Mountain of Alabaster. Morzillo's injuries were so\r\nsevere that he became a burden to the expedition, and Cortes left him\r\nbehind with Canek, charging the latter to take good care of him. When\r\nMorzillo died, probably from lack of proper food, the Itzas made an\r\nimage of him which they treated as an idol. In 1618 Padre Orbita,\r\ninfuriated by this idol and the worship accorded it, shattered the\r\nimage.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3.7: I am at a loss to explain why Gomara heads his chapter\r\n\"De como Canec quemo los Idolos.\" Canek, according to most accounts,\r\ndid not actually burn the idols; he merely promised to do so.]\r\n\r\n                               Chapter IV\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4.1: These names are a puzzle; it may be that these men later\r\nin life became identified with the two cities whose names they adopted.\r\nThere is neither a Lima nor a Quito in Spain, as both those names are\r\nof American origin. Lima, however, is a common enough name in Portugal,\r\nand it is one of the great names of Brazil.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4.2: When the town of Valladolid was first founded it was\r\neither on or very near the east coast of Yucatan. The original\r\nfoundation took place about 1542; many years later the town was moved\r\nto its present location some twenty-five miles to the southwest of Lake\r\nSuchen. In some of the old maps Valladolid is indicated in such a way\r\nthat one is perfectly justified in assuming that the city was still at\r\nno great distance from the sea. Such maps as that of Blaauw (1667), as\r\nthat of Montanus (1671), as that of Vander Aa (1729), and that of\r\nBellin (1764) fall into this category. On the other hand the maps of\r\nBrion de la Tour (1783) and of Lopez (1801) show Valladolid in\r\napproximately its present situation. We may safely believe, then, that\r\nthe move took place between 1764 and 1783, long after Cogolludo wrote,\r\nand that therefore he had the first location in mind.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4.3: The province of Choaca or Cochva is in the northeast\r\ncorner of Yucatan.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4.4: Champoton = Potonchan = Chakanputun = Chanputun.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4.5: Antonio de Mendoza, Conde de Tendilla, born about 1480,\r\ndied 1552, was Viceroy of Mexico (New Spain) from 1535 to 1551. He\r\nestablished the Bishopric of Michoacan in 1537 and from 1551 to 1552\r\nwas Viceroy of Peru. He was a statesman of excellent qualities.]\r\n\r\n                               Chapter V\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5.1: Villagutierre's spelling of proper names and\r\ncapitalization are given in most cases.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5.2: Cogolludo adds some details concerning the mock embassy\r\nof the Itzas to Merida which the account of Villagutierre lacks.\r\nCogolludo says (p. 472 ff.) that, in the time of Don Antonio de\r\nFigueroa, who was Governor of Yucatan from August, 1612, to September,\r\n1617, Yucatan enjoyed a goodly measure of prosperity, which was\r\ninterrupted in the following manner: \"... there came in the time of\r\nthis Governor [Figueroa] to the city of Merida some Itzaex Indians,\r\nsaying that their purpose was to give their obedience to the King and\r\nto the Governor in his name, and he gave them staffs as Alcaldes, and\r\nappointed them a government, and they returned, leaving him in the\r\nbelief that they were voluntarily his subjects, but soon it was all\r\nseen to be a trick. Now that it was known that the coming of those\r\nIndians had no better end than this, in the reign of this Governor a\r\ngreat reduction of this province was carried on, for many of the people\r\nof this Province were fugitives in the Woodlands of Zahcabchen. By\r\nthese, says the Bachiller Valencia in his relation, were founded the\r\nVillages of San Antonio de Zahcabchen, San Lorenzo de Vlumal, Tzuctok,\r\nCauich, by a commission headed by Captain Francisco de Villalobos, his\r\n[Valencia's] grandfather, who intended the reduction of these\r\npeople....\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5.3: This was the Juan de Coronel who was the author of an\r\n\"Arte en lengua de Maya\" published by Diego Garrido, Mexico, 1620. See\r\nWilkinson Sale Catalog, 1914, number 193.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5.4: A curious misuse of this word. The Caribs of the West\r\nIndies were so ferocious that their name became proverbial as a synonym\r\nfor savagery; our own word \"cannibal\" is derived from it. Ancona says\r\nthat the Caribs actually made invasions into Yucatan (1878, vol. i, p.\r\n29). The present Lacandones are usually called Caribes by the Spanish\r\npopulation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5.5: _Vecino_ = citizen, i.e., freeholder. The\r\nnon-freeholders were not citizens in Spanish America.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5.6: The prophecies spoken of by Avendano (pp. 22, 23)\r\nare interesting. They are those of Patzin Yaxun, of Nahau Pec, of\r\nAhkukil-Chel, of Ahnupuc-Tun, and of Chilan-Balam, High-priest of\r\nTixcacayoc Cabich in Mani. The text of all of them is given by\r\nVillagutierre and by Cogolludo; translations appear in Fancourt and\r\nmany other places.\r\n\r\nWe may believe that no matter when the events took place which gave\r\nrise to the present versions of the prophecies, the versions themselves\r\nprobably grew up among the Itzas between 1524 and 1618, for, as we have\r\nseen, the Canek of Cortes's day displayed no aversion to the proposed\r\nintroduction of Christianity among his subjects.\r\n\r\nIt is not denied that a foundation in fact may have existed for the\r\nbelief that the seers of northern Yucatan foretold some calamity; the\r\npresent contention is merely that the prophecies which the Itzas had in\r\nmind when they told Padre Fuensalida that the time for their conversion\r\nhad not yet come were of comparatively recent origin among them. The\r\nCatholic character of the phraseology is too obvious to dwell upon.\r\n\r\nCf. Villagutierre, p. 35 ff.; Cogolludo, p. 96 ff.; Fancourt, 1854, p.\r\n57 ff.; Lizana, 1633, pt. ii, chap. i; Brasseur de Bourbourg, 1858,\r\nvol. ii, p. 603; Orozco y Berra, 1880, pp. 73-74; Carrillo y Ancona,\r\n1883, pp. 523-606.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to pass over without remark the fact that Mr.\r\nMaudslay, in a note at pages 34 and 35 of the last volume of his\r\nedition of Bernal Diaz, creates a false impression of the reason why\r\nPadres Fuensalida and Orbita left Tayasal. As the two last paragraphs\r\nof Maudslay's note stand they imply that the Padres left Tayasal\r\nbecause of the hostility of the Indians caused by the breaking of the\r\nidol of the horse. As a matter of fact this was not the reason. Rather,\r\ntheir leaving was due to the fact that the Itzas refused to be baptized\r\nbefore the time which they believed to be appointed for their\r\nconversion.]\r\n\r\n                               Chapter VI\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6.1: The description given by Cogolludo (lib. x, caps. 2, 3)\r\nof the events during and resulting from the entrada of Delgado is much\r\nthe same as that of Villagutierre y Sotomayor. He calls Zaclun\r\n\"Zacalum.\" This entrada is mentioned by Fray Andres de Avendano y\r\nLoyola (p. 28 verso), who attributes the blame for the slaying of\r\nDelgado to the Spanish soldiers who followed him.]\r\n\r\n                              Chapter VII\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7.1: Avendano (p. 1 recto) calls him Don Martin de Urssua y\r\nArismendi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7.2: See Tozzer, 1912.]\r\n\r\n                              Chapter VIII\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8.1: Others write this name Ursua y Arizmendi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8.2: A digest of the itinerary of the two trips of Avendano is\r\ngiven in Appendix IV.]\r\n\r\n                               Chapter IX\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9.1: The text of the cedula in question may be found at pp.\r\n18v-22r in Avendano's MS.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9.2: The reader's attention is called here to Plates Ia and\r\nIb, and also to Maler, 1908, p. 56 for a reproduction and translation\r\nof the map by Avendano.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9.3: This refers to the myth, shared alike by the Toltecs and\r\nMayas, of the culture hero, Quetzalcoatl-Kulkulcan, who was to return\r\nto the land from across the ocean.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9.4: A gloss reads \"Cajon con el huesso.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9.5: This work has never been found.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9.6: Cogolludo (lib. iv, cap. 5) gives the following\r\ndescription of the calendar and the method of reckoning time. \"In the\r\ntime of their heathendom the Indians of Yucathan had books made of the\r\nbark of trees; over this was a white cement which was perpetual, and\r\nthese books were from ten to twelve varas long, being doubled over and\r\nfolded.... On these the Indians painted the accounts of their years,\r\nwars, inundations, famines, hurricanes, and other events. From one of\r\nthem, which Dr. Aguilar took away from some Idolaters, it was learned\r\nthat in ancient times there was a plague called _Mayacimil_ and also\r\nanother called _Ocna Kuchil_, which is to say Sudden Deaths, and\r\nTimes-in-which-ravens-entered-the-houses-to-eat-the-corpses. Inundation\r\nand hurricane they called _Hunyecil_, Overflowing-of-trees....\r\n\r\n\"They counted the year as having 365 days, divided into months of\r\ntwenty days each, corresponding to ours in this order:\r\n\r\n  Jan. 12-Feb.   1 was Yaax      July  11-July  17 was Vayeab\r\n  Feb.  1-Feb.  21  \"  Zac       July  17-Aug.   6  \"  Poop\r\n  Feb. 21-Mch.  13  \"  Ceh       Aug.   6-Aug.  26  \"  Voo\r\n  Mch. 13-Apr.   2  \"  Mac       Aug.  26-Sept. 15  \"  Cijp\r\n  Apr.  2-Apr.  22  \"  Kan Kin   Sept. 15-Oct.      \"  Zeec\r\n  Apr. 22-May   12  \"  Muan      Oct.    -Nov.      \"  Zul\r\n  May  12-Jun.   1  \"  Paax      Nov.    -Dec.      \"  Yax Kin\r\n  Jun.  1-Jun.  21  \"  Kayab     Dec.    -Dec.      \"  Mool\r\n  Jun. 21-July  11  \"  Cum Ku    Dec.    -Jan.  11  \"  Cheen\r\n\r\nBy this count the year was divided into eighteen months, but their year\r\nbegan on the seventeenth of our July. The five days which were lacking\r\nto complete the 365 were called Nameless Days. They held them to be\r\nmelancholy, and they said that on them happened disastrous deaths and\r\nunforeseen events, such as stings and bites from poisonous snakes and\r\nwild or venomous animals as well as quarrels and dissensions; and they\r\nespecially feared the first of these days. During this period they\r\ntried not to go out of their houses, and so they always provided\r\nthemselves with what was necessary beforehand so as not to have to go\r\nto the fields or elsewhere. At this time they attended especially to\r\ntheir Heathen Rites, begging their Idols to keep them free from harm in\r\nthose dangerous days and to grant that the following year might be\r\nfertile and abundant. And these days so greatly feared were the 11, 12,\r\n13, 14, 15 and 16 (sic) of our July. All the days of the month had each\r\nits name, which I leave untold for fear of prolixity.\r\n\r\n\"By means of this count they know the time in which to clear the\r\nwoodlands and to burn the underbrush, to expect rains, to sow the Maize\r\nand other vegetables, for all which actions they have their Proverbs.\r\nThe first Religious (says Aguilar), holy men, and true Keepers of the\r\nVineyard of Jesus Christ, tried to abolish this count, holding it to be\r\nsuperstitious, but they did not progress far because most [of the\r\nIndians] know it. This matter was laid before a great and Apostolic Man\r\nnamed Padre Solana, and before another scarcely less great called Fray\r\nCaspar de Naxara, who were great Ministers and Preachers and who felt\r\nthat it was not prejudicial to the Christianizing of the Indians; but\r\nPadre Fuensalida says in his Relacion, treating of the ancient counts:\r\n'It would be far better in every way if the Indians did not learn and\r\nknow of the ancient peoples, because they have been found still at\r\ntheir idolatries, and those who were converted to our Holy Catholic\r\nFaith still perform the rites, adoring the Demon through thousands of\r\nIdols which have been found in this Province.' ...\r\n\r\n\"They counted their eras and ages which they put in their books by\r\ngroups of twenty years and by lustra of four years. The first year they\r\nfixed in the East, calling it _Cuchhaab_; the second in the West,\r\ncalling it _Hijx_; the third in the South, _Cavac_; the fourth in the\r\nNorth, called _Muluc_.\" These refer to the four dominical days, which\r\nhe has given incorrectly. They should be Kan, Muluc, Ix (Hijx), and\r\nCauac. (See Bowditch, 1910, p. 278.) \"When these lustra reached five,\r\nwhich is exactly twenty years, they called it a _Katun_ and placed a\r\ncarved stone upon another, fixing them with lime and sand in the\r\nwalls of their Temples and the houses of their Priests, as is\r\nto be seen today in the edifices which have been spoken of and\r\nin certain ancient walls of our Convent in Merida, over which\r\nthere are cells. In a village called Tixualahtun, which signifies\r\nPlace-where-a-carved-stone-is-placed-upon-another, it is said that\r\nthere were Archives where were preserved all the events, as is done in\r\nSpain at the Archivo de Simancas.\r\n\r\n\"The common way of counting their age was by these periods or Katuns,\r\nas, for instance, to say 'I have sixty years' _Oxppelvabil_--'I have\r\nthree eras of age,' that is, three stones; for seventy it is three and\r\na half. Wherever it was known that there were not too many barbarians,\r\nthey continued to live by this count, and it was said to be very\r\naccurate, so much so that not only did they know with certainty of an\r\nevent, but also of the day and month on which it took place.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9.7: A gloss reads \"the devil excites their minds.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9.8: A gloss reads \"varias cosas que tratamos.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter X\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10.1: This passage (Villagutierre, p. 315) is very important.\r\nThe question of the location of Dolores and of Lacandon, as well as\r\nthat of their identity, has long been a moot point. (Tozzer's\r\nintroduction to Marjil, 1912.) The main body of the Lacandones, as well\r\nChol-speaking as Maya-speaking, lies southwest of Lake Peten. (Cf.\r\nTozzer, 1907.) That fact accounts for Costello's location of Los\r\nDolores southwest of the lake. (Fancourt, 1854, map.) On the map of our\r\nregion in Hazius and Lowitz' Atlas of 1746 Lacandon and Los Dolores are\r\nlocated northwest of the lake, whereas maps such as those of Bellin\r\n(1764) and Brion de la Tour (1783) do not mention either, nor do they\r\nleave any territory southeast of the lake where they might possibly be.\r\nIn spite of these contradictions we need be in little doubt as to the\r\ntrue location of Los Dolores del Lacandon, for as the expedition under\r\nParedes was marching southward, their left was to the east, and\r\nconsequently they were to march southeast from Tzucthok in order to\r\nreach Los Dolores. The Lacandones have been shown to have existed in\r\nthat region as well as in Chiapas. (Thomas, 1911, p. 70 and map.)\r\nTherefore we may safely believe that Hendges (Map of Guatemala, 1902)\r\nis right in locating Los Dolores southeast of the lake. Further\r\nconfirmation of this belief lies in the fact that Mr. Morley found in\r\nthe village of Dolores three church bells dated 1718, which bear\r\ninscriptions that show they were intended for the Church of Nuestra\r\nSenora de los Dolores en la Provincia del Yiza, i.e., the Dolores of\r\nwhich we speak.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10.2: This is, of course, the same ambassador in whose\r\nauthenticity Avendano, as we know, felt so much distrust. Something is\r\nknown in regard to this messenger. His full name was Don Martin Can,\r\nand he was a native of Peten Grande, whose King was Canek. His father\r\nwas Can, a native of Tipu; his mother was Cante, sister of Canek. His\r\nfather, stung by a serpent, had long been dead; his mother, of whom he\r\nhad heard it said that she came from Chichen Itza, had also been dead a\r\nlong time. He was baptized Martin a year before in Merida, and, though\r\nhe did not know exactly, he thought he was about thirty years old. He\r\nwas married to an Indian girl named Coboh, who lived in Alain. Canek\r\nhad sent him and three other Indians of Alain to Merida with an embassy\r\nand with a crown of plumes as homage, to ask for Padres to come and\r\nenlighten the Indians as to the True God. Having passed from Alain he\r\nhad arrived at Tipu, where the Muzules Indians had wished to join him,\r\nand although he knew them to be mere savages, he took them with him.\r\nAll sorts of food and drink, as well as a house, had been made ready\r\nfor the Padres who should go to Alain. He had then gone to Merida and\r\nhad been most cordially received by Ursua. His baptism had taken place\r\nand he had delivered his message, receiving in return many presents for\r\nCanek and for himself. After taking leave of Don Martin de Ursua, Can\r\nand his companions, together with Hariza and the Padres, had returned\r\nto Tipu, where they stayed two weeks until, on account of the\r\nopposition of the Cacique Zima, Can fled to Alain, leaving the present\r\nfor Canek in the hands of Hariza. Arrived in Alain, Can was told by\r\nChamaxculu, the Cacique, that many of the Indians had rebelled against\r\nCanek, killing many of the Spaniards. He himself was the object of the\r\nIndians' hatred on account of his conversion. He took refuge in the\r\nsmall Peten of Motzkal until he was sent for by Canek, his uncle. He\r\ntold how trenches and walls of stones had been built at Peten Grande.\r\nBoth the King Canek and the chief priest Kincanek were now in Peten\r\nready to defend it against the Spaniards who had injured them. The\r\nCacique of Alain, Chamaxculu, wished, with his people, to be\r\nChristianized.]\r\n\r\n                              Appendix II\r\n\r\n[Footnote A2.1: To judge by the haphazard way in which the words and\r\nphrases contained in the MS. are set down, and taking into\r\nconsideration the informal nature of the MS. itself, this vocabulary\r\nwas intended by Dr. Berendt merely to act as a field glossary and\r\nphrase book.
