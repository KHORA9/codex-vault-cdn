MURRAY.\r\n\r\n  LONDON, JUNE 1ST, 1855.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND AND CHEAP EDITION.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe encouragement of friends, and the opinions expressed by a large\r\nmajority of those publications that considered the former edition worthy\r\nof notice, have induced me to cut out many passages which might possibly\r\nnot interest the general reader, in order that I might send it forth to\r\nthe public in a more cheap and popular form.\r\n\r\nWriting upon such a subject as the United States, her constitution, and\r\nher institutions, there was necessarily some danger of a taint of\r\npolitical partisanship. I trust, however, I may he considered to have\r\nredeemed the pledge I made of writing \"free from political bias,\" when I\r\nhave found favour in the pages of two publications so opposite in their\r\npolitics as the _Westminster Review_ and the _Press_.\r\n\r\nOne weekly paper with pretensions to literary criticism (the\r\n_Athenaeum_, September 15, 1855) did me the honour of making me the\r\nobject of its unmeasured censure; but, as I was forewarned that my\r\nsuccess would interfere with the prospects of one of its contributors, I\r\nwas prepared for its animadversions, though most certainly I did not\r\nanticipate the good fortune of a zeal so totally void of discretion,\r\nthat the animus which guided the critic's pen should be too transparent\r\nto impose upon even a child.\r\n\r\nConceive a would-be critic, after various spasmodic efforts at severity,\r\nselecting from among many _comprehensive_ measures suggested by me for\r\nthe future emancipation, and for the present benefit, of the slave, the\r\nproposition of \"a proper instrument for flogging, to be established by\r\nlaw,\" and _that_ with the evident intention of throwing ridicule on the\r\nidea. If the critic were occasionally subject to the discipline of the\r\nvarious instruments used for the punishment of the negro, his instinct\r\nwould soon teach him that which appears to be at present beyond the\r\ngrasp of his intellect, viz., the difference between a cow-hide and a\r\ndog-whip; and if he knew anything of his own country, he could scarcely\r\nbe ignorant that the instruments used for corporal punishment in army,\r\nnavy, and prisons, are established by law or by a custom, as strong as\r\nlaw. But enough of this Athenian Reviewer, I offer for his reflection\r\nthe old story, \"Let her alone, poor thing; it amuses her, and does me no\r\nharm.\" The next time he tries to sling a stone, I hope he will not again\r\ncrack his own skull in the clumsy endeavour.\r\n\r\n  \"Ill nature blended-with cold blood\r\n  Will make a critic sound and good.\r\n  This useful lesson hence we learn,\r\n  Bad wine to good sound vinegar will turn.\"\r\nOLD PAMPHLET.\r\n\r\n\r\nI now launch my barque upon a wider ocean than before. The public must\r\ndecide whether her sails shall flap listlessly against the masts, or\r\nswell before a stiff and prosperous breeze.\r\n\r\nH.A.M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHAPTER GRATIS AND EXPLANATORY\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n_Make Ready--Fire--Departure_.\r\n\r\nFROM LONDON TO NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nPreparations\r\nLIVERPOOL--Embarkation Scenes\r\nScenes on Board\r\nCAPE RACE\r\nPilot\r\nNEW YORK\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n_Land of Stars and Stripes_.\r\n\r\nAT NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nThe First View\r\nCustom House\r\nFerry Boat\r\nFirst Impressions\r\nHospitality\r\nAmerican Hotels\r\nBar and Barbers\r\nBridal Chamber\r\nPaddy Waiter\r\nFeeding System\r\nStreets and Buildings\r\nPortrait Hatter\r\nAdvertisements\r\nLoafing in Broadway\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n_Sights and Amusements_.\r\n\r\nAT NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nYacht Club and Dinner.\r\nRailway Society to LONG ISLAND\r\nRace Stand\r\nTrotting Match\r\nMetallic Coffin\r\nAmerican Horse\r\nHack Cabs and Drivers\r\nOmnibuses\r\nCity Railway Cars\r\nTravelling Railway Cars\r\nTickets for Luggage\r\nLocomotive\r\nSuggestions for Railway Companies\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n_A Day on the North River_.\r\n\r\nFROM NEW YORK TO GENESEO.\r\n\r\nEmbark in Steamer on Hudson\r\nPassengers and Anecdotes\r\nScenery of River\r\nALBANY--Disembark\r\nA Hint for Travellers\r\nPopulation and Prosperity\r\nRailway through Town\r\nProfessor of Soap\r\nCANANDAIGUA--Hospitality.\r\nEarly Education\r\nOpposite System\r\nDrive across Country--Snake Fences and Scenery\r\nChurches--a Hint for the Highlands\r\nCheap Bait--GENESEO\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n_Geneseo_.\r\n\r\nAT GENESEO\r\n\r\nAbsence of Animal Life--Early Rising\r\nView from the Terrace--Work of the Pioneer\r\nFarm and System, Wages, &c.\r\nA Drive--Family Scene\r\nLAKE CANESUS\r\nPlank road.

Who wants a preface? Nay, more--what is a\r\npreface? Who can define it? That which it is most unlike is the\r\nmathematical myth called a point, which may be said to have neither\r\nlength nor breadth, and consequently no existence; whereas a preface\r\ngenerally has extreme length, all the breadth the printer can give it,\r\nand an universal existence.\r\n\r\nBut if prefaces cannot be described with mathematical accuracy, they\r\nadmit of classification with most unmathematical inaccuracy. First, you\r\nhave a large class which may be called CLAIMERS. Ex.: One claims a\r\ncertain degree of consideration, upon the ground that it is the author's\r\nfirst effort; a second claims indulgence, upon the ground of haste; a\r\nthird claims attention, upon the ground of the magnitude and importance\r\nof the subject, &c. &c. Another large class may be termed MAKERS. Ex.:\r\nOne makes an excuse for tediousness; a second makes an apology for\r\ndelay; a third makes his endeavours plead for favourable reception, &c.\r\nThen again you have the INTERROGATOR, wherein a reader is found before\r\nthe work is printed, convenient questions are put into his mouth, and\r\nready replies are given, to which no rejoinder is permitted. This is\r\nvery astute practice.--Then again there is the PUFFER AND CONDENSER,\r\nwherein, if matter be wanting in the work, a prefacial waggon is put\r\nbefore the chapteral pony, the former acting the part of pemican, or\r\nconcentrated essence, the latter representing the liquid necessary for\r\ncooking it; the whole forming a _potage au lecteur_, known among\r\nprofessional men as \"soldier's broth.\"\r\n\r\nMy own opinion on this important point is, that a book is nothing more\r\nnor less than a traveller; he is born in Fact or Fancy; he travels along\r\na goose-quill; then takes a cruise to a printer's. On his return thence\r\nhis health is discovered to be very bad; strong drastics are applied; he\r\nis gradually cooked up; and when convalescent, he puts on his Sunday\r\nclothes, and struts before the public. At this critical juncture up\r\ncomes the typish master of the ceremonies, Mr. Preface, and commences\r\nintroducing him to them; but knowing that both man and woman are\r\nessentially inquisitive, he follows the example of that ancient and\r\nshrewd traveller who, by way of saving time and trouble, opened his\r\naddress to every stranger he accosted, in some such manner as the\r\nfollowing:--\"Sir, I am Mr. ----, the son of Mr. ----, by ----, his wife\r\nand my mother. I left ---- two days ago. I have got ---- in my\r\ncarpet-bag. I am going to ---- to see Mr. ----, and to try and purchase\r\nsome ----.\" Then followed the simple question for which an answer was\r\nwanted, \"Will you lend me half-a-crown?\" \"Tell me the road;\" \"Give me a\r\npinch of snuff;\" or \"Buy my book,\" as the case might be. The stranger,\r\ngratified with his candour, became immediately prepossessed in his\r\nfavour. I will endeavour to follow the example of that 'cute traveller,\r\nand forestall those questions which I imagine the reader--if there be\r\none--might wish to ask.\r\n\r\n1. Why do I select a subject on which so many abler pens have been\r\nfrequently and lately employed?--Because it involves so many important\r\nquestions, both socially and politically, in a field where the changes\r\nare scarcely less rapid than the ever-varying hues on the dying dolphin;\r\nand because the eyes of mankind, whether mental or visual, are as\r\ndifferent as their physiognomies; and thus those who are interested in\r\nthe subject are enabled to survey it from different points of view.\r\n\r\n2. Do I belong to any of those homoeopathic communities called political\r\nparties?--I belong to none of them; I look upon all of them as so many\r\ndrugs in a national apothecary's shop. All have their useful qualities,\r\neven the most poisonous; but they are frequently combined so\r\ninjudiciously as to injure John Bull's health materially, especially as\r\nall have a strong phlebotomizing tendency, so much so, that I often see\r\npoor John in his prostration ready to cry out, \"Throw Governments to the\r\ndogs--I'll none of them!\" If in my writings I appear to show on some\r\npoints a political bias, it is only an expression of those sentiments\r\nwhich my own common sense[B] and observation have led me to entertain on\r\nthe subject under discussion, and for which I offer neither defence nor\r\napology.\r\n\r\n3. Am I an artist?--No; I am an author and a plagiarist. Every sketch in\r\nmy book is taken from some other work, except the \"Screecher,\" which is\r\nfrom the artistic pen of Lady G.M.; and the lovely form and features of\r\nthe coloured sylph, for which I am indebted to my friend Mr. J.F.C.--You\r\nmust not be too curious.--I consider myself justified in plagiarizing\r\nanything from anybody, if I conceive it will help to elucidate my\r\nsubject or amuse my reader, provided always I have a reasonable ground\r\nfor believing the source is one with which the general reader is not\r\nlikely to be acquainted. But when I do steal, I have the honesty to\r\nconfess it.\r\n\r\n4. What is my book about?--It treats of an island, a confederacy and a\r\ncolony; and contains events of travel, facts and thoughts concerning\r\npeople, telegraphs, railroads, canals, steam, rivers, commercial\r\nprosperity, education, the Press, low literature, slavery, government,\r\n&c. &c.\r\n\r\n5. What security can I offer for the pretensions advanced being made\r\ngood?--None whatever. Who takes me, must take me, like a wife, \"for\r\nbetter for worse,\" only he is requested to remember I possess three\r\ndistinct advantages over that lady.--First, you can look inside me as\r\nwell as out: Secondly, you can get me more easily and keep me more\r\ncheaply: Thirdly, if you quarrel with me, you can get a divorce in the\r\nfire-place or at the trunkmaker's, without going to the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nI trust I have now satisfied all the legitimate demands of curiosity.\r\n\r\nI will only further remark that in some of my observations upon, the\r\nUnited States, such as travelling and tables-d'hôte, the reader must\r\nbear in mind that in a land of so-called equality, whenever that\r\nprinciple is carried out, no comparison can be drawn accurately between\r\nsimilar subjects in the Republic and in England.\r\n\r\nThe society conveyed in one carriage in the States embraces the first,\r\nsecond, and third-class passengers of Great Britain; and the society fed\r\nat their tables-d'hôte contains all the varieties found in this country,\r\nfrom the pavilion to the pot-house. If we strike a mean between the\r\nextremes as the measure of comfort thus obtained, it is obvious, that in\r\nproportion as the traveller is accustomed to superior comforts in this\r\ncountry, so will he write disparagingly of their want in the States,\r\nwhereas people of the opposite extreme will with equal truth laud their\r\nsuperior comforts. The middle man is never found, for every traveller\r\neither praises or censures. However unreasonable it might be to expect\r\nthe same refinements in a Republic of \"Equal rights,\" as those which\r\nexist in some of the countries of the Old World under a system more\r\nfavourable to their development, it is not the less a traveller's duty\r\nto record his impressions faithfully, leaving it to the reader to draw\r\nhis own conclusions.\r\n\r\nIt was suggested to me to read several works lately published, and\r\ntreating of the United States; but as I was most anxious to avoid any of\r\nthat bias which such reading would most probably have produced, I have\r\nstrictly avoiding so doing, even at the risk of repeating what others\r\nmay have said before.\r\n\r\nI have nothing further to add in explanation.--The horses are to.--The\r\ncoach is at the door.--Chapter one is getting in.--To all who are\r\ndisposed to accompany me in my journey, I say--Welcome!\r\n\r\nH.A.M.\r\n\r\nD 4, ALBANY, LONDON,\r\n\r\n_1st June, 1855_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: Perhaps \"human instinct\" might be a more modest\r\nexpression.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n_\"Make ready ... Fire!\" The Departure._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preparations for the start of a traveller on a long journey are\r\ndoubtless of every variety in quality and quantity, from the poor Arab,\r\nwhose wife carries his house as well as all his goods--or perhaps I\r\nshould rather say, from Sir Charles Napier of Scinde with his one\r\nflannel waistcoat and his piece of brown soap--up to the owners of the\r\nDover waggon-looking \"_fourgon_\" who carry with them for a week's trip\r\nenough to last a century. My weakness, reader, is, I believe, a very\r\ncommon one, i.e., a desire to have everything, and yet carry scarce\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of this arrangement are very perplexing to your\r\nservant, if you have one, as in my case. First you put out every\r\nconceivable article on the bed or floor, and then with an air of\r\nself-denial you say, \"There, that will be enough;\" and when you find an\r\nadditional portmanteau lugged out, you ask with an air of astonishment\r\n(which may well astonish the servant), \"What on earth are you going to\r\ndo with that?\" \"To put your things into it, sir,\" is the very natural,\r\nreply; so, after a good deal of \"Confound it, what a bore,\" &c., it ends\r\nin everything being again unpacked, a fresh lot thrown aside, and a new\r\npacking commenced; and believe me, reader, the oftener you repeat this\r\ndiscarding operation, the more pleasantly you will travel. I speak from\r\nexperience, having, during my wanderings, lost everything by shipwreck,\r\nand thus been forced to pass through all the stages of quantity, till I\r\nonce more burdened myself as unnecessarily as at starting.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely September morning in 1852, when, having put my traps\r\nthrough the purging process twice, and still having enough for\r\nhalf-a-dozen people, I took my place in the early train from\r\nEuston-square for Liverpool, where I was soon housed in the Adelphi. A\r\nyoung American friend, who was going out in the same steamer on the\r\nfollowing morning, proposed a little walk before the shades of evening\r\nclosed in, as he had seen nothing of the city. Off we started, full of\r\nintentions never to be realized: I stepped into a cutler's shop to buy a\r\nknife; a nice-looking girl in the middle of her teens, placed one or two\r\nbefore me; I felt a nudge behind, and a voice whispered in my ear, \"By\r\nGeorge, what a pretty hand!\" It was perfectly true; and so convinced was\r\nmy friend of the fact, that he kept repeating it in my ear. When my\r\npurchase was completed, and the pretty hand retired, my friend exhibited\r\nsymptoms of a strong internal struggle: it was too much for him. At last\r\nhe burst out with, \"Have you any scissors?\"--Aside to me, \"What a pretty\r\nlittle hand!\"--Then came a demand for bodkins, then for needles, then\r\nfor knives, lastly for thimbles, which my friend observed were too\r\nlarge, and begged might be tried on her taper fingers. He had become so\r\nenthusiastic, and his asides to me were so rapid, that I believe he\r\nwould have bought anything which those dear little hands had touched.\r\n\r\nPaterfamilias, who, while poring over his ledger, had evidently had his\r\nears open, now became alarmed at the reduction that was going on in his\r\nstock, and consequently came forward to scrutinize the mysterious\r\npurchaser. I heard a voice muttering \"Confound that old fellow!\" as the\r\ndutiful daughter modestly gave place to papa; a Bank of England tenner\r\npassed from my friend's smallclothes to the cutler's small till, and a\r\nhalf-crown _vice versa_. When we got to the door it was pitch dark; and\r\nthus ended our lionizing of the public buildings of Liverpool.\r\n\r\nOn the way back to the hotel, as my companion was thinking aloud, I\r\nheard him alternately muttering in soft tones, \"What a pretty hand,\" and\r\nthen, in harsh and hasty tones, '\"Confound,\" ... \"crusty old fellow;\"\r\nand reflecting thereon, I came to the conclusion that if the expressions\r\nindicated weakness, they indicated that pardonable civilizing weakness,\r\nsusceptibility to the charms of beauty; and I consequently thought more\r\nkindly of my future fellow-traveller. In the evening we were joined by\r\nmy brother and a young officer of the Household Brigade, who were to be\r\nfellow-passengers in our trip across the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nEarly morning witnessed a procession of hackney coaches, laden as though\r\nwe were bent on permanent emigration. Arrived at the quay, a small,\r\nwretched-looking steamer was lying alongside, to receive us and our\r\ngoods for transport to the leviathan lying in mid-channel, with her\r\nsteam up ready for a start.\r\n\r\nThe operation of disposing of the passengers' luggage in this wretched\r\nlittle tea-kettle was amusing enough in its way. Everybody wanted\r\neverybody else's traps to be put down, below, and their own little this,\r\nand little that, kept up: one group, a man, wife, and child,\r\nparticularly engaged my attention; the age of the child, independent of\r\nthe dialogue, showed that the honeymoon was passed.\r\n\r\nWIFE.--\"Now, William, my dear, _do_ keep that little box up!\"\r\n\r\nHUSBAND.--\"Hi! there; keep that hat-box of mine up!\" (_Aside_,) \"Never\r\nmind your box, my dear, _it_ wont hurt.\"\r\n\r\nWIFE.--\"Oh, William, there's my little cap-box going down! it will be\r\nbroken, in pieces.\"\r\n\r\nHUSBAND.--\"Oh! don't be afraid, my dear, they'll take care of it. Stop,\r\nmy man, that's my desk; give it me here,\" &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue was brought to a sudden stop by the frantic yell of the\r\njuvenile pledge of their affections, whose years had not yet reached two\r\nfigures; a compact little iron-bound box had fallen on his toe, and the\r\npoor little urchin's pilliloo, pilliloo, was pitiful. Mamma began\r\nhugging and kissing, while papa offered that handy consolation of,\r\n\"Never mind, that's a good boy; don't cry.\" In the meantime, the Jacks\r\nhad profited by the squall, and, when it ceased, the happy couple had\r\nthe satisfaction of seeing all their precious boxes buried deep in the\r\nhold.\r\n\r\nThe stream of luggage having stopped, and the human cargo being all on\r\nboard, we speedily cast off our lashings, and started: fortunately, it\r\nwas fine weather, for, had there been rain, our ricketty tea-kettle\r\nwould have afforded us no protection whatever. On reaching the\r\nleviathan, the passengers rushed up hastily, and, armed with\r\nwalking-sticks or umbrellas, planted themselves like sentries on the\r\ndeck. As the Jacks came tumbling up with the luggage, shouts of \"Hi!\r\nthat's mine,\" rent the air; and if Jack, in the hurry and confusion, did\r\nnot attend to the cry, out would dart one or other with umbrella or\r\nstick, as the case might be, and harpoon him under the fifth rib; for,\r\nwith a heavy burden on his head and shoulders, necessarily supported by\r\nboth hands, defence was impossible. I must say, Jack took it all in good\r\nhumour, and filing a bill \"STOMACH _v_. RIBS,\" left it to Old Neptune to\r\nobtain restitution for injuries inflicted on his sons. I believe those\r\nwho have once settled their accounts with that sea-deity are not more\r\nanxious to be brought into his court again, than those who have enjoyed\r\nthe prolonged luxury of a suit in Chancery.\r\n\r\nEverything must have an end; so, the mail agent arriving with his postal\r\ncargo, on goes the steam, and off goes the \"Africa,\" Captain Harrison.\r\n\r\n  \"Some wave the hand, and some begin to cry,\r\n  Some take a weed, and nodding, say good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nI am now fairly off for New York, with a brother and two friends; we\r\nhave each pinned our card to the red table-cover in the saloon, to\r\nindicate our permanent positions at the festive board during the voyage.\r\nUnless there is some peculiarity in arrangement or circumstance, all\r\nvoyages resemble each other so much, that I may well spare you the\r\ndullness of repetition. Stewards will occasionally upset a soup-plate,\r\nand it will sometimes fall inside the waistcoat of a \"swell,\" who\r\ntravelling for the first time, thinks it requisite to \"get himself up\"\r\nas if going to the Opera. People under the influence of some internal\r\nand irresistible agency, will occasionally spring from the table with an\r\nenergy that is but too soon painfully exhausted, upsetting a few side\r\ndishes as their feet catch the corner of the cloth. Others will rise,\r\nand try to look dignified and composed, the hypocrisy whereof is\r\nunpleasantly revealed ere they reach the door of the saloon; others eat\r\nand drink with an ever-increasing vigour, which proves irresistibly the\r\ntruth of the saying, \"_L'appétit vient en mangeant_.\" Heads that walked\r\nerect, puffing cigars like human chimneys in the Mersey, hang listless\r\nand 'baccoless in the Channel (Mem., \"Pride goes before a fall\").\r\nLadies, whose rosy cheeks and bright eyes, dimmed with the parting tear,\r\nhad, as they waved the last adieu, told of buoyant health and spirits,\r\ngather mysteriously to the sides of the vessel, ready for any emergency,\r\nor lie helpless in their berths, resigning themselves to the ubiquitous\r\nstewardess, indifferent even to death itself. Others, again, whose\r\ninteriors have been casehardened by Old Neptune, patrol the deck, and,\r\nif the passengers are numerous, congratulate each other in the most\r\nheartless manner by the observation, \"There'll be plenty of room in the\r\nsaloon, if this jolly breeze continues!\"\r\n\r\nAll these things are familiar to most travellers, suffice it, therefore,\r\nto say, that on the present occasion Old Neptune was in a good humour,\r\n\"the jolly breeze\" did not last long, nor was it ever very jolly. My\r\nAmerican friend and the Household Brigade-man tried very hard to make\r\nout that they felt sick at first, but I believe I succeeded in\r\nconvincing them that it was all imagination, for they both came steadily\r\nto meals, and between them and my brother, who has the appetite of a\r\nPawnee when at sea, I found that a modest man like myself got but\r\n\"monkey's allowance\" of the champagne which I had prescribed as a\r\nmedicine, erroneously imagining that those internal qualms usually\r\nproduced by a sea voyage would have enabled me to enjoy the lion's\r\nshare.\r\n\r\nWe saw nothing during the voyage but a few strange sail and a couple of\r\nicebergs, the latter very beautiful when seen in the distance, with the\r\nsea smooth as a mirror, and the sun's rays striking upon them. I felt\r\nvery thankful the picture was not reversed; the idea of running your\r\nnose against an iceberg, in the middle of a dark night, with a heavy\r\ngale blowing and sea running, was anything but pleasant.\r\n\r\nIn due time we made Cape Race. I merely mention the fact for the purpose\r\nof observing that the captain, and others to whom I have spoken since,\r\nunanimously agree in condemning the position of the lighthouse; first,\r\nas not being placed on the point a vessel from Europe would make,\r\ninasmuch as that point is further north and east; and secondly, because\r\nvessels coasting northwards are not clear of danger if they trend away\r\nwestward after passing the light. There may be some advantages to the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood, but, for the general purposes of navigation,\r\nits position is a mistake, and has, on more than one occasion, been very\r\nnearly the cause of the wreck of one of our large steamers[C].\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the tenth day I heard voices outside my cabin\r\nsaying, \"Well, they've got the pilot on board,\" _ergo_, we must be\r\nnearing our haven. In the Channel at home you know a pilot by a\r\nfoul-weather hat, a pea-coat, broad shoulders, and weather-beaten\r\ncheeks; here, the captain had told me that I could always know them by a\r\npolished beaver and a satin or silk waistcoat. When I got on deck, sure\r\nenough there was the beaver hat and the silk vest, but what struck me\r\nmost, was the wearer, a slim youth, hardly out of his teens. In the\r\ndistance, the New York pilot-boat, a build rendered famous by the\r\nachievements of the \"America,\" at Cowes, lay on the water like a duck,\r\nwith her canvas white as snow, and taut as a deal board. The perfect\r\nease and nonchalance of the young pilot amused me immensely, and all\r\nwent on smoothly enough till the shades of evening closed in upon us; at\r\nwhich time, entering the Narrows, the satin-vested youth felt himself\r\nquite nonplused, despite his taking off his beaver, and trying to\r\nscratch for knowledge; in short, had it not been for Captain Harrison,\r\nwho is a first-rate seaman and navigator, as all who ever sail with him\r\nare ready to testify, we might have remained out all night: fortunately,\r\nhis superior skill got us safe in, and no easy task I assure you is it,\r\neither to find the channel, or to thread your way through hosts of\r\nshipping, in one of these leviathan steamers.\r\n\r\nI confess I formed a very low estimate of New York pilots, which was not\r\nheightened by one of the mates showing me an embossed card, with his\r\naddress, which our pilot had presented to him, accompanied with an\r\ninvitation to come to a _soirée_. As the mystery was subsequently\r\nsolved, I had better give you the solution thereof at once, and not let\r\nthe corps of New York pilots lie under the ban of condemnation in your\r\nminds as long as they did in mine. It turned out that the pert little\r\nyouth was not an authorized pilot, but merely schooling for it; and\r\nthat, when the steamer hove in sight, the true pilots were asleep, and\r\nhe would not allow them to be called, but quietly slipped away in the\r\nboat, and came on board of us to try his 'prentice hand; the pilots of\r\nNew York are, I believe, a most able and efficient body of men.\r\n\r\nHere I am, reader, at New York, a new country, a new hemisphere, and\r\npitch dark, save the lights reflected in the water from the town on\r\neither side. All of a sudden a single toll of a bell, then another, and\r\nfrom the lights in the windows you discover a large wooden house is\r\nadrift. On inquiry, you ascertain it is merely one of their mammoth\r\nferry-boats; that is something to think of, so you go to bed at\r\nmidnight, and dream what it will really look like in the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: I believe another lighthouse is to be erected on the proper\r\nheadland.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n_The Land of Stars and Stripes._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun had aired the opening day before I appeared on deck. What a\r\nscene! There was scarce a zephyr to ripple the noble Hudson, or the\r\nglorious bay; the latter, land-locked save where lost in the distant\r\nocean; the former skirted by the great Babylon of America on one side,\r\nand the lovely wooded banks of Hoboken on the other. The lofty western\r\nhills formed a sharp yet graceful bend in the stream, round which a\r\nfleet of small craft, with rakish hulls and snowy sails, were stealing\r\nquietly and softly, like black swans with white wings; the stillness and\r\nrepose were only broken by the occasional trumpet blast of some giant\r\nhigh-pressure steamer, as she dashed past them with lightning speed.\r\nSuddenly a floating island appeared in the bend of the river; closer\r\nexamination proved it to be a steamer, with from twenty to twenty-five\r\nlarge boats secured alongside, many of them laden at Buffalo, and coming\r\nby the Erie Canal to the ocean. Around me was shipping of every kind and\r\nclime; enormous ferry-boats radiating in all directions; forests of\r\nmasts along the wharves; flags of every colour and nation flying; the\r\ndingy old storehouses of the wealthy Wall-street neighbourhood, and the\r\nlofty buildings of the newer parts of the town; everything had something\r\nnovel in its character, but all was stamped with go-aheadism. This\r\nglorious panorama, seen through the bright medium of a rosy morn and a\r\ncloudless sky, has left an enjoyable impression which time can never\r\nefface. But although everything was strange, I could not feel myself\r\nabroad, so strong is the power of language.\r\n\r\nTaking leave of our worthy and able skipper, we landed on the soil of\r\nthe giant Republic at Jersey city, where the wharves, &c., of the Cunard\r\nline are established, they not having been able to procure sufficient\r\nspace on the New York side. The first thing we ran our heads against\r\nwas, of course, the Custom-house; but you must not imagine, gentle\r\nreader, that a Custom-house officer in America is that mysterious\r\ncompound of detective police and high-bred ferret which you too often\r\nmeet with in the Old World. He did not consider it requisite to tumble\r\neverything out on the floor, and put you to every possible\r\ninconvenience, by way of exhibiting his importance; satisfied on that\r\npoint himself, he impressed you with it by simple courtesy, thus gaining\r\nrespect where the pompous inquisitive type of the animal would have\r\nexcited ill-will and contempt. Thank heaven, the increased\r\ninter-communication, consequent upon steam-power, has very much\r\ncivilized that, until lately, barbarian portion of the European family;\r\nnor do I attempt to deny that the contiguity of the nations, and the far\r\ngreater number of articles paying duty, facilitating and increasing\r\nsmuggling, render a certain degree of ferretishness a little more\r\nrequisite on the part of the operator, and a little more patience\r\nrequisite on the part of the victim.\r\n\r\nA very few minutes polished our party off, and found us on board of the\r\nferry-boat; none of your little fiddling things, where a donkey-cart and\r\nan organ-boy can hardly find standing-room, but a good clear\r\nhundred-feet gangway, twelve or fourteen feet broad, on each side of the\r\nengine, and a covered cabin outside each gangway, extending half the\r\nlength of the vessel; a platform accommodating itself to the rise and\r\nfall of the water, enables you to drive on board with perfect ease,\r\nwhile the little kind of basin into which you run on either side, being\r\nformed of strong piles fastened only at the bottom, yields to the vessel\r\nas she strikes, and entirely does away with any concussion. I may here\r\nadd, that during my whole travels in the States, I found nothing more\r\nperfect in construction and arrangement than the ferries and their\r\nboats, the charges for which are most moderate, varying according to\r\ndistances, and ranging from one halfpenny upwards.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say what struck me most forcibly on landing at New\r\nYork; barring the universality of the Saxon tongue, I should have been\r\npuzzled to decide in what part of the world I was. The forest of masts,\r\nand bustle on the quays, reminded me of the great sea-port of Liverpool:\r\nbut scarce had I left the quays, when the placards of business on the\r\ndifferent stories reminded me of Edinburgh. A few minutes more, and I\r\npassed one of their large streets, justly called \"Avenues,\" the rows of\r\ntrees on each side reminding me of the _Alamedas_ in the Spanish towns;\r\nbut the confusion of my ideas was completed when the hackney coach was\r\nbrought to a standstill, to allow a huge railway carriage to cross our\r\nbows, the said carriage being drawn by four horses, and capable of\r\ncontaining fifty people.\r\n\r\nAt last, with my brain in a whirl, I alighted at Putnam's hotel, where\r\nmy kind friend, Mr. W. Duncan, had prepared rooms for our party; nor did\r\nhis zeal in our behalf stop here, for he claimed the privilege of being\r\nthe first to offer hospitality, and had already prepared a most\r\nexcellent spread for us at the far-famed _Café Delmonico_, where we\r\nfound everything of the best: oysters, varying from the \"native\" size up\r\nto the large American oyster, the size of a small leg of Welsh\r\nmutton--mind, I say a small leg--the latter wonderful to look at, and\r\npleasant to the taste, though far inferior to the sweet little \"native.\"\r\n\r\nHere I saw for the first time a fish called \"the sheep's head,\" which is\r\nunknown, I believe, on our side of the Atlantic. It derives its name\r\nfrom having teeth exactly like those of a sheep, and is a most excellent\r\nfish wherewith to console themselves for the want of the turbot, which\r\nis never seen in the American waters. Reader, I am not going to inflict\r\nupon you a bill of fare; I merely mention the giant oyster and the\r\nsheep's head, because they are peculiar to the country; and if nearly my\r\nfirst observations on America are gastronomic, it is not because I\r\nidolize my little interior, though I confess to having a strong\r\npredilection in favour of its being well supplied; but it is because\r\nduring the whole time I was in the United States,--from my friend D.,\r\nwho thus welcomed me on my arrival, to Mr. R. Phelps, in whose house\r\nI lived like a tame cat previous to re-embarking for old\r\nEngland,--wherever I went I found hospitality a prominent feature in the\r\nAmerican character.\r\n\r\nHaving enjoyed a very pleasant evening, and employed the night in\r\nsleeping off the fumes of sociability, I awoke, for the first time, in\r\none of the splendid American hotels; and here, perhaps, it may be as\r\nwell to say a few words about them, as their enormous size makes them\r\nalmost a national peculiarity.\r\n\r\nThe largest hotel in New York, when I arrived, was the Metropolitan, in\r\nthe centre of which is a theatre; since then, the St. Nicholas has been\r\nbuilt, which is about a hundred yards square, five stories high, and\r\nwill accommodate, when completed, about a thousand people. Generally\r\nspeaking, a large hotel has a ladies' entrance on one side, which is\r\nquite indispensable, as the hall entrance is invariably filled with\r\nsmokers; all the ground floor front, except this hall and a\r\nreading-room, is let out as shops: there are two dining-saloons, one of\r\nwhich is set apart for ladies and their friends, and to this the vagrant\r\nbachelor is not admitted, except he be acquainted with some of the\r\nladies, or receive permission from the master of the house. The great\r\nentrance is liberally supplied with an abundance of chairs, benches,\r\n&c., and decorated with capacious spittoons, and a stove which glows\r\nred-hot in the winter. Newspapers, of the thinnest substance and the\r\nmost microscopic type, and from every part of the Union, are scattered\r\nabout in profusion; the human species of every kind may be seen\r\nvariously occupied--groups talking, others roasting over the stove, many\r\ncracking peanuts, many more smoking, and making the pavement, by their\r\nunited labours, an uncouth mosaic of expectoration and nutshells, varied\r\noccasionally with cigar ashes and discarded stumps. Here and there you\r\nsee a pair of Wellington-booted legs dangling over the back of one\r\nchair, while the owner thereof is supporting his centre of gravity on\r\nanother. One feature is common to them all--busy-ness; whether they are\r\ntalking, or reading, or cracking nuts, a peculiar energy shows the mind\r\nis working. Further inside is the counter for the clerks who appoint the\r\nrooms to the travellers, as they enter their names in a book; on long\r\nstools close by is the corps of servants, while in full sight of all\r\nstands the \"Annunciator,\" that invaluable specimen of American\r\nmechanical ingenuity, by which, if any bell is pulled in any room, one\r\nloud stroke is heard, and the number of the room disclosed, in which\r\nstate it remains until replaced; so that if everybody had left the hall,\r\nthe first person returning would see at once what bells had been rung\r\nduring his absence, and the numbers of the rooms they belonged to. Why\r\nthis admirable contrivance has not been introduced into this country, I\r\ncannot conceive.\r\n\r\nThe bar is one of the most--if not the most--important departments in\r\nthe hotel; comparatively nothing is drunk at dinner, but the moment the\r\nmeal is over, the bar becomes assailed by applicants; moreover, from\r\nmorning to midnight, there is a continuous succession of customers; not\r\nmerely the lodgers and their friends, but any parties passing along the\r\nstreet, who feel disposed, walk into the bar of any hotel, and get \"a\r\ndrink.\" The money taken at a popular bar in the course of a day is, I\r\nbelieve, perfectly fabulous.\r\n\r\nScarcely less important than the bar is the barber's shop. Nothing\r\nstruck me more forcibly than an American under the razor or brush: in\r\nany and every other circumstance of life full of activity and energy,\r\nunder the razor or brush he is the picture of indolence and\r\nhelplessness. Indifferent usually to luxury, he here exhausts his\r\ningenuity to obtain it; shrinking usually from the touch of a nigger as\r\nfrom the venomed tooth of a serpent, he here is seen resigning his nose\r\nto the digital custody of that sable operator, and placing his throat at\r\nhis mercy, or revelling in titillary ecstasy from his manipulations with\r\nthe hog's bristles;--all this he enjoys in a semi-recumbent position,\r\nobtained from an easy chair and a high stool, wherein he lies\r\nwith a steadiness which courts prolongation--life-like, yet\r\nimmoveable--suggesting the idea of an Egyptian corpse newly embalmed.\r\nNever shaving myself more than once a fortnight, and then requiring no\r\nsoap and water, and having cut my own hair for nearly twenty years, I\r\nnever thought of going through the experiment, which I have since\r\nregretted; for, many a time and oft have I stood, in wonder, gazing at\r\nthis strange anomaly of character, and searching in vain for a first\r\ncause. The barber's shop at the St. Nicholas is the most luxurious in\r\nNew York, and I believe every room has its own brush, glass, &c.,\r\nsimilarly numbered in the shop.\r\n\r\nThe crowning peculiarity of the new hotels is \"The Bridal Chamber;\" the\r\nwant of delicacy that suggested the idea is only equalled by the want of\r\ntaste with which it is carried out. Fancy a modest girl, having said\r\n\"Yes,\" and sealed the assertion in the solemn services of the Church,\r\nretiring to the bridal chamber of the St. Nicholas! In the first place,\r\nretiring to an hotel would appear to her a contradiction in terms; but\r\nwhat would be her feelings when she found the walls of her apartment\r\nfurnished with fluted white silk and satin, and in the centre of the\r\nroom a matrimonial couch, hung with white silk curtains, and blazing\r\nwith a bright jet of gas from each bed-post! The doors of the\r\nsleeping-rooms are often fitted with a very ingenious lock, having a\r\nseparate bolt and keyhole on each side, totally disconnected, and\r\nconsequently, as they can only be opened from the same side they are\r\nfastened, no person, though possessed of a skeleton key, is able to\r\nenter. The ominous warning, \"Lock your door at night,\" which is usually\r\nhung up, coupled with the promiscuous society frequently met in large\r\nhotels, renders it most advisable to use every precaution.\r\n\r\nMany hotels have a Bible in each bed-room, the gift of some religious\r\ncommunity in the city; those that I saw during my travels were most\r\nfrequently from the Presbyterians.\r\n\r\nHaving given you some details of an American first-class hotel in a\r\nlarge city, you will perhaps be better able to realize the gigantic\r\nnature of these establishments when I tell you that in some of them,\r\nduring the season, they consume, in one way and another, DAILY, from\r\nfifteen hundred to two thousand pounds of meats, and from forty-five to\r\nfifty pounds of tea, coffee, &c., and ice by the ton, and have a corps\r\nof one hundred and fifty servants of all kinds. Washing is done in the\r\nhotel with a rapidity little short of marvellous. You can get a shirt\r\nwell washed, and ready to put on, in nearly the same space of time as an\r\nAmerican usually passes under the barber's hands. The living at these\r\nhotels is profuse to a degree, but, generally speaking, most\r\ndisagreeable: first, because the meal is devoured with a rapidity which\r\na pack of fox-hounds, after a week's fast, might in vain attempt to\r\nrival; and, secondly, because it is impossible to serve up dinners for\r\nhundreds without nine-tenths thereof being cold. The best of the large\r\nhotels I dined at in New York, as regards _cuisine_, &c., was decidedly\r\nthe New York Hotel; but by far the most comfortable was the one I lived\r\nin--Putnam's, Union-square--which was much smaller and quite new,\r\nbesides being removed from the racket of Broadway.\r\n\r\nThe increased intercourse with this country is evidently producing a\r\nmost improving effect in many of the necessary and unmentionable\r\ncomforts of this civilized age, which you find to predominate chiefly in\r\nthose cities that have most direct intercourse with us; but as you go\r\nfurther west, these comforts are most disagreeably deficient. One point\r\nin which the hotels fail universally is attendance; it is their\r\nmisfortune, not their fault; for the moment a little money is realized\r\nby a servant, he sets up in some business, or migrates westward. The\r\nconsequence is, that the field of service is left almost entirely to the\r\nIrish and the negro, and between the two--after nearly a year's\r\nexperience thereof--I am puzzled to say in whose favour the balance is.\r\n\r\nI remember poor Paddy, one morning, having answered the Household\r\nBrigade man's bell, was told to get some warm water. He went away, and\r\nforgot all about it. Of course, the bell rang again; and, on Paddy\r\nanswering it, he was asked--\r\n\r\n\"Did I not tell you to get me some warm water?\"\r\n\r\n\"You did, your honour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, why have you not brought it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't tell, your honour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, go and get it at once.\"\r\n\r\nPaddy left the room, and waited outside the door scratching his head. In\r\nabout a quarter of an hour a knock was heard:--\r\n\r\n\"Come in!\"\r\n\r\nPaddy's head appeared, and, with a most inquiring voice, he said--\r\n\r\n\"Is it warm water to dhrink you want, your honour?\" _Ex uno_, &c.\r\n\r\nAnother inconvenience in their hotels is the necessity of either living\r\nat the public table, or going to the enormous expense of private rooms;\r\nthe comfort of a quiet table to yourself in a coffee-room is quite\r\nunknown. There is no doubt that sitting down at a table-d'hôte is a\r\nready way to ascertain the manners, tone of conversation, and, partly,\r\nthe habits of thought, of a nation, especially when, as in the United\r\nStates, it is the habitual resort of everybody; but truth obliges me to\r\nconfess that, after a very short experience of it, I found the old adage\r\napplicable, \"A little of it goes a great way;\" and I longed for the\r\ncleanliness, noiselessness, and comfort of an English coffee-room,\r\nthough its table be not loaded with equal variety and profusion.\r\n\r\nThe American system is doubtless the best for the hotelkeeper, as there\r\nare manifest advantages in feeding masses at once, over feeding the same\r\nnumber in detail. A mess of twenty officers, on board a man-of-war, will\r\nlive better on two pounds each a month than one individual could on\r\nthree times that sum. It is the want of giving this difference due\r\nconsideration which raises, from time to time, a crusade against the\r\nhotels at home, by instituting comparisons with those of the United\r\nStates. If people want to have hotels as cheap as they are in America,\r\nthey must use them as much, and submit to fixed hours and a mixture of\r\nevery variety of cultivation of mind and cleanliness of person--which\r\nchange is not likely, I trust, to take place in my day. It is a curious\r\nfact, that when the proprietor of the Adelphi, at Liverpool--in\r\nconsequence of a remonstrance made by some American, gentlemen as to his\r\ncharges--suggested to them that they should name their own hour and dine\r\ntogether, in which case his charges would be greatly diminished, they\r\nwould not hear of such a thing, and wanted to know why they should be\r\nforced to dine either all together, or at one particular hour. An\r\nAmerican gentleman, with whom I am acquainted, told me that, when he\r\nfirst came over to England, the feeling of solitude, while breakfasting\r\nalone, at his table in Morley's coffee-room, was quite overpowering.\r\n\"Now,\" he added, \"I look forward to my quiet breakfast and the paper\r\nevery morning with the greatest pleasure, and only wonder how I can have\r\nlived so long, and been so utterly ignorant of such simple enjoyment.\" I\r\nhave thought it better to make these observations thus early, although\r\nit must be obvious they are the results of my subsequent experience, and\r\nI feel I ought to apologize for their lengthiness.\r\n\r\nThere is comparatively little difficulty in finding your way about New\r\nYork, or, indeed, most American towns, except it be in the old parts\r\nthereof, which are as full of twists, creeks, and names as our own. The\r\nnewer part of the town is divided into avenues running nearly parallel\r\nwith the Hudson; the streets cross them at right angles, and both are\r\nsimply numbered; the masses of buildings which these sections form are\r\nvery nearly uniform in area, and are termed blocks. The great place for\r\nlounging, or loafing, as they term it--is Broadway, which may be said to\r\nbisect New York longitudinally; the shops are very good, but, generally\r\nspeaking, painfully alike, wearying the eye with sameness, when the\r\nnovelty has worn off: the rivalry which exists as to the _luxe_ of\r\nfitting up some of these shops is inconceivable.\r\n\r\nI remember going into an ice-saloon, just before I embarked for England;\r\nthe room on the ground-floor was one hundred and fifty feet long by\r\nforty broad; rows of pillars on each side were loaded to the most\r\noutrageous extent with carving and gilding, and the ceiling was to\r\nmatch; below that was another room, a little smaller, and rather less\r\ngaudy; both were crowded with the most tag-rag and bob-tail mixture of\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe houses are built of brick, and generally have steps up to them, by\r\nwhich arrangement the area receives much more light; and many people\r\nwith very fine large houses live almost exclusively in these basements,\r\nonly using the other apartments for some swell party: the better class\r\nof houses, large hotels, and some of the shops, have their fronts faced\r\nwith stone of a reddish brown, which has a warm and pleasant appearance.\r\nThe famous \"Astor House\" is faced with granite, and the basement is of\r\nsolid granite. The most remarkable among the new buildings is the\r\nmagnificent store of Mr. Stewart--one of the largest, I believe, in the\r\nworld: it has upwards of one hundred and fifty feet frontage on\r\nBroadway, and runs back nearly the same distance: is five stories high,\r\nbesides the basement; its front is faced with white marble, and it\r\ncontains nearly every marketable commodity except eatables. If you want\r\nanything, in New York, except a dinner, go to Stewart's, and it is ten\r\nto one you find it, and always of the newest kind and pattern; for this\r\nhuge establishment clears out every year, and refills with everything of\r\nthe newest and best. Goods are annually sold here to the amount of\r\nupwards of a million sterling--a sum which I should imagine was hardly\r\nexceeded by any establishment of a similar nature except Morison's in\r\nLondon, which, I believe, averages one and a half million. Some idea of\r\nthe size of this store may be formed, from the fact that four hundred\r\ngas burners are required to light it up. Mr. Stewart, I was informed,\r\nwas educated for a more intellectual career than the keeper of a store,\r\non however grand a scale; but circumstances induced him to change his\r\npursuits, and as he started with scarce any capital, the success which\r\nhas attended him in business cannot but make one regret that the world\r\nhas lost the benefit which might have been anticipated from the same\r\nenergy and ability, if it had been applied to subjects of a higher\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nI will now offer a few observations on the state of the streets. The\r\nassertion has been made by some writer--I really know not who--that New\r\nYork is one of the dirtiest places in the world. To this I must give a\r\nmost unqualified denial. No person conversant with many of the large\r\nprovincial towns in England and Scotland, can conscientiously \"throw a\r\nvery large stone\" at New York; for though much is doing among us to\r\nimprove and sweeten--chiefly, thanks to the scourge of epidemics--I fear\r\nthat in too many places we are still on this point \"living in glass\r\nhouses.\" Doubtless, New York is infinitely dirtier than London, as\r\nLondon at present is far less clean than Paris has become under the rule\r\nof the Third Napoleon. I fully admit that it is not so clean as it\r\nshould be, considering that the sum nominally spent on cleansing the\r\nstreets amounts to very nearly sixty thousand pounds a year, a sum equal\r\nto one pound for every ten inhabitants; but the solution of this problem\r\nmust be looked for in the system of election to the corporation offices,\r\non which topic I propose to make a few observations in some future\r\nportion of these pages. While on the subject of streets, I cannot help\r\nremarking that it always struck me as very curious that so intelligent a\r\npeople as the Americans never adopted the simple plan of using sweeping\r\ncarts, which many of their countrymen must have seen working in London.\r\nIf not thoroughly efficient, their ingenuity might have made them so;\r\nand, at all events, they effect a great saving of human labour. But\r\nthere is a nuisance in the streets of New York, especially in the lower\r\nand business part of the town, which must be palpable to every\r\nvisitor--I mean the obstructions on the pavement; and that, be it\r\nobserved, in spite of laws passed for the prevention thereof, but\r\nrendered nugatory from maladministration. In many places, you will see a\r\nman occupying the whole pavement opposite his store with leviathan boxes\r\nand bales, for apparently an indefinite period, inasmuch as I have seen\r\nthe same things occupying the same place day after day, and forcing\r\nevery passer-by off the pavement. This information may console some of\r\nour own communities who are labouring under the gnawing and painful\r\ndisease of a similar corrupt and inefficient administration.\r\n\r\nAmid the variety of shops, the stranger cannot fail to be struck with\r\nthe wonderful number of oyster-saloons stuck down on the basement, and\r\ndaguerreotypists perched in the sky-line: their name is legion;\r\neverybody eats oysters, and everybody seems to take everybody else's\r\nportrait. To such an extent is this mania for delineating the 'human\r\nface divine' carried, that a hatter in Chatham-street has made no small\r\nprofit by advertising that, in addition to supplying hats at the same\r\nprice as his rivals, he will take the portrait of the purchaser, and fix\r\nit inside thereof gratis. This was too irresistible; so off I went, and,\r\nselecting my two dollar beaver on the ground-floor, walked up to a six\r\nfoot square garret room, where the sun did its work as quick as light,\r\nafter which the liberal artist, with that flattering propensity which\r\nbelongs to the profession, threw in the roseate hues of youth by the aid\r\nof a little brick-dust. I handed him my dust in return, and walked away\r\nwith myself on my head, where myself may still be daily seen, a\r\ntravelled and travelling advertisement of Chatham-street enterprise.\r\n\r\nOur American friends deal largely in newspaper puffs, and as some of\r\nthem are amusing enough, I select the following as specimens of their\r\n\"Moses and Son\" style:--\r\n\r\n  ANOTHER DREADFUL ACCIDENT.--OH, MA! I MET WITH A DREADFUL\r\n  ACCIDENT!--The other night, while dancing with cousin Frank, I dropped\r\n  my Breastpin and Ear-Ring on the floor and broke them all to\r\n  pieces--Never mind, my dear. Just take them to ---- Jewellery\r\n  Store. You can get them made as good as new again!\r\n\r\n  GRATIFYING NEWS.--We have just learned, with real pleasure, that the\r\n  _seedy_ young man who sprained his back whilst trying to \"raise the\r\n  wind\" is fast recovering, in consequence of judiciously applying the\r\n  Mustang Liniment. It is to be hoped he will soon be entirely cured,\r\n  and that the next time he undertakes it, he will take an _upright_\r\n  position, and not adopt the _stooping_ posture. This precaution, we\r\n  have no doubt, will ensure success.\r\n\r\n  This Liniment can be had of ----.\r\n\r\nEven, marriage and death are not exempt from the fantastic advertising\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\n  On Friday, June 10, by the Rev. Mr. ----, after a severe and\r\n  long-protracted courtship, which they bore with Christian fortitude\r\n  and resignation, solely sustained and comforted, under all misgivings,\r\n  by their sincere and confiding belief in the promise of a rich, and\r\n  living inheritance in another state, Mr. ---- to Miss ----, all of this\r\n  city.\r\n\r\n  On April 4, of congestion of the brain, F---- E----, son of J---- and\r\n\r\n  M---- C.

According to that paper, he advertises in thirteen hundred\r\npapers in the United States, and has expended, in different parts of the\r\nworld, the enormous sum of nearly half a million sterling, solely for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\nBut, reader, there are more interesting objects to dwell upon than\r\nthese. If you will only \"loaf\" up and down Broadway on a fine afternoon,\r\nyou will see some of the neatest feet, some of the prettiest hands, some\r\nof the brightest eyes, and some of the sweetest smiles the wildest\r\nbeauty-dreamer ever beheld in his most rapturous visions; had they but\r\ngood figures, they would excite envy on the Alamedas of Andalusia; in\r\nshort, they are the veriest little ducks in the world, and dress with\r\nParisian perfection. No wonder, then, reader, when I tell you that\r\n\"loafing\" up and down Broadway is a favourite occupation with the young\r\nmen who have leisure hours to spare. So attractive did my young friend\r\nof the Household Brigade find it, that it was with difficulty he was\r\never induced to forego his daily pilgrimage. Alas! poor fellow, those\r\ndays are gone--he has since been \"caught,\" and another now claims his\r\nundivided adoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n_Sights and Amusements_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a very pleasant yacht club at New York, the festive assembly\r\nwhereof is held at Hoboken. Having received a hospitable invite, I\r\ngladly availed myself of it, and, crossing the Hudson, a short walk\r\nbrought me and my chaperon to the club-house--no palatial edifice, but a\r\nrustic cottage, with one large room and a kitchen attached, and\r\nbeautifully situated a few yards from the water's edge, on the woody\r\nbank of Hoboken, and on one of the most graceful bends of the river. It\r\ncommands a splendid view, while perfectly cozy in itself, and is, \"par\r\nexcellence,\" the place for a pic-nic. The property belongs to Commodore\r\nStevens, who is well known to English yachting gentlemen, not only from\r\nhis having \"taken the shine out of them\" at Cowes, but also for his\r\namiability and hospitality.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival, I found a host of bachelors, and wedded men _en garçon_,\r\nready to greet me with a hearty welcome. The room was very comfortable,\r\nbut as unfurnished as those who like to smoke could desire; in fact,\r\nbarring the table and its burden, the chairs and their occupiers, the\r\nremainder of the furniture consisted of models of all the yachts of the\r\nclub. The only exception was that of the Commodore's triumphant \"Black\r\nMaria,\" of which extraordinary vessel I purpose speaking more fully\r\nhereafter. One of the peculiar customs of the club is, that two members,\r\nwhose capabilities are beyond dispute, are appointed, one to make the\r\nsoup, called \"chowder,\" the other the punch--or \"toddy,\" as it is here\r\ntermed,--both of these being excellent in their way, and different in\r\nmany respects from any similar article at home. The proper recipe for\r\nthe same shall be forthcoming when I give details of the \"Black Maria.\"\r\n\r\nOur party was a very jovial one, as I think parties generally are when\r\ncomposed of those who are much _on_ the water. Such people naturally\r\nlook upon a leak as very lubberly and unprofessional, and therefore\r\nscrupulously avoid letting _in_ any water, supplying its place with\r\nsomething more cheery, under the enlivening influence whereof, those who\r\nwould be puzzled to decide whether a hand-organ was playing \"Hail,\r\nColumbia!\" or \"Pop goes the Weasel,\" lose all false modesty as to their\r\nmusical powers, and become royally (I beg majesty's pardon) vocal.\r\nChoruses receive the additional charm of variety from each vocalist\r\ngiving his tongue \"universal suffrage\" as to power, matter, and melody;\r\neverybody evinces a happy independence, and if, as the chorus is\r\nbeginning, an unlucky wight finds his cigar just going out, he takes a\r\nfew puffs to save the precious fire, and then starts off Derby pace to\r\ncatch up his vocal colleagues, blending ten notes into one in his\r\nfrantic chase.\r\n\r\nTo any one who delights in the opera, this description might suggest a\r\nslight idea of discord, but to one who has enjoyed a midshipman's berth\r\nit recals some of the cheeriest days of his life; as I heard the joyous\r\nshouts, I felt my grey lank hairs getting black and curly again (?). Do\r\nnot imagine this merry scene was the produce of any excess; we were as\r\nsober as judges, though we felt their gravity would have been out of\r\nplace; but when some choice spirit--and there was more than one\r\nsuch--with the soul of melody in him, took the field, we left him to\r\nmake all the running himself, and smoked our cigars with increased\r\nvigour, shrouding him in the curling cloud to prevent any nervous\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\nEverything, however, must have an end, and as the hour for the last\r\nferry-boat was fast approaching, the voice of melody was hushed in the\r\nhall, to echo through the groves of Hoboken and o'er the waters of the\r\nHudson, as we strolled from the club-house to the ferry, and thence to\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nAmong other \"lions\" to be seen, my curiosity was excited by the news of\r\na trotting match, to come off at Long Island: some friend was ever\r\nready, so off we started for Brooklyn Ferry, whence we went by railway.\r\nIn the olden time these races were as fashionable at New York as Ascot\r\nor Epsom are in England; all the _élite_ of both sexes filled the stand,\r\nand the whole scene was lively and gay. Various circumstances, which all\r\nwho know the turf are aware it is liable to, rendered gentlemen so\r\ndisgusted with it at Long Island, that they discontinued sending horses\r\nto run, and gradually gave up going themselves, and it is now left all\r\nbut entirely to the \"rowdies,\"--_alias_ mob.\r\n\r\nThe railway carriage into which we got contained about forty of these\r\nworthies, all with cigars in their mouths, and exhibiting many strange\r\nvarieties of features and costume. In the passage up and down the middle\r\nof the carriage; ragged juvenile vendors of lollipops and peanuts kept\r\npatrolling and crying out their respective goods, for which they found a\r\nready market; suddenly another youth entered, and, dispensing a fly-leaf\r\nright and left as he passed along to each passenger, disappeared at the\r\nother door. At first, I took him for an itinerant advertiser of some\r\nYankee \"Moses and Son,\" or of some of those medicinal quacks who strive\r\nto rob youth by lies calculated to excite their fears. Judge my\r\nastonishment, then, when on looking at the paper, I found it was hymns\r\nhe was distributing. A short ride brought us close to the course, and,\r\nas I alighted, there was the active distributor freely dispensing on\r\nevery side, everybody accepting, many reading, but all hurrying on to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nHaving paid a good round sum as entrance to the stand, I was rather\r\ndisappointed at nearly breaking my neck, when endeavouring to take\r\nadvantage of my privilege, for my foot well-nigh went through a hole in\r\nthe flooring. Never was anything more wretched-looking in this world. It\r\nwas difficult to believe, that a few years back, this stand had been\r\nfilled with magnates of the \"upper ten thousand\" and stars of beauty:\r\nthere it was before me, with its broken benches, scarce a whole plank in\r\nthe floor, and wherever there was one, it was covered with old cigar\r\nstumps, shells of peanuts, orange-peel, &c. When, however, I found that\r\nseven people constituted the number of spectators in the stand, its\r\ndilapidation was more easily explained, especially when I discovered\r\nthat access, with a little activity, was easily obtainable at the sides\r\n_gratis_--a fact soon proved by the inroad of a few \"rowdies,\" and the\r\nubiquitous vendors of lollipops and peanuts, headed by the persevering\r\ndistributor of hymns.\r\n\r\nLet us turn now from the dreary stand to the scene below. The\r\nrace-course is a two-mile distance, perfectly level, on a smooth and\r\nstoneless road, and forming a complete circle--light trotting waggons\r\nare driving about in the centre, taking it easy at sixteen miles an\r\nhour; outside are groups of \"rowdies.\" making their hooks and looking\r\nout for greenhorns--an article not so readily found at Long Island as at\r\nEpsom.\r\n\r\nThe race is to be \"under the saddle,\" and the long list of competitors\r\nwhich had been announced has dwindled down to the old and far-famed Lady\r\nSuffolk and the young and unfamed Tacony.\r\n\r\nA stir among the \"rowdies\" is seen, followed by the appearance \"on the\r\nboards\" of Lady Suffolk. I gazed in wonder as I saw her--a small\r\npony-looking animal--moving her legs as though they were in splints, and\r\nas if six miles an hour was far beyond her powers; soon after, Tacony\r\ncame forward, the picture of a good bony post-horse, destitute of any\r\nbeauty, but looking full of good stuff. The riders have no distinctive\r\ndress; a pair of Wellington boots are pulled on outside the trousers,\r\nsharp spurs are on the heels--rough and ready looking birds these. The\r\nwinning-post is opposite the stand, the umpire is there with a deal\r\nboard in his hand, a whack on the side of the stand \"summons to horse,\"\r\nand another summons to \"start.\" The start is from the distance-post, so\r\nas to let the horses get into the full swing of their pace by the time\r\nthey reach the winning-post, when, if they are fairly up together, the\r\ncry \"Off\" is given; if it be not given, they try again. When speaking of\r\nthe time in which the mile is completed, the fact of its commencing at\r\nfull speed should always be borne in mind: sometimes false starts are\r\nmade by one party, on purpose to try and irritate the temper of the\r\nadversary's horse; and in the same way, if a man feels he has full\r\ncommand of his own horse, he will yell like a wild Indian, as he nears\r\nhis adversary, to make him \"break up\"--or go into a gallop; and, as they\r\nare all trained to speed more by voice than by spur, he very often\r\nsucceeds, and of course the adversary loses much ground by pulling up\r\ninto a trot again.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion there was no false start; the echo of the second\r\nwhack was still in the car as they reached the winning-post neck and\r\nneck. \"Off\" was the word, and away they went. It certainly was\r\nmarvellous to see how dear old Lady Suffolk and her stiff legs flew\r\nround the course; one might have fancied she had been fed on lightning,\r\nso quick did she move them, but with wonderfully short steps. Tack, on\r\nthe contrary, looked as if he had been dieted on India-rubber balls:\r\nevery time he raised a hind leg it seemed to shoot his own length a-head\r\nof himself; if he could have made his steps as quick as the old lady, he\r\nmight have done a mile in a minute nearly. Presently, Tacony breaks up,\r\nand, ere he pulls into a trot, a long gap is left. Shouts of \"Lady\r\nSuffolk, Lady Suffolk wins!\" rend the air; a few seconds more, and the\r\ngiant strides of Tacony lessen the gap at every step: they reach the\r\ndistance-post neck and neck; \"Tacony wins!\" is the cry, and true enough\r\nit is--by a length. Young blood beats old blood--India-rubber balls\r\n\"whip\" lightning. Time, five minutes.\r\n\r\nThe usual excitement and disputing follow, the usual time elapses--whack\r\nnumber one is heard, all ready--whack number two, on they come, snaffle\r\nbridles, pulling at their horses' mouths as though they would pull the\r\nbit right through to the tips of their tails. \"Off\" is the cry: away\r\nthey go again; Tacony breaks up--again a gap, which huge strides\r\nspeedily close up--again Tacony wins. Time, five minutes five seconds.\r\nAll is over, rush to the cars, &c. Remarks:--first, the pace is at the\r\nrate of twenty-four miles an hour; second, the clear old lady, who was\r\nonly beaten by a length, is long out of her teens; is it not wonderful,\r\nand is she not glorious in her defeat? Fancy Dowager Lady L---- taking a\r\npedestrian fit, and running a race along Rotten Row with some \"fast\r\nyoung man;\" what would you say, if she clutched his coat-tail as he\r\ntouched the winning-post? Truly, that dear old Lady Suffolk is a\r\nmarvellous quadruped. Reader, as you do not care to go back again with\r\nthe Rowdies and Co., we will suppose ourselves returned to New York, and\r\nI can only hope you have not been bored with your day's amusement.\r\n\r\nAmong the extraordinary fancies of this extraordinary race--who are ever\r\npanting for something new, even if it be a new territory--the most\r\nstrange is the metallic coffin: the grave is no protection against their\r\nmania for novelty. In the windows of a shop in Broadway, this strange,\r\nand to my mind revolting, article may be seen, shaped like a mummy,\r\nfitting hermetically tight, and with a plate of glass to reveal the\r\nfeatures of the inanimate inmate. I have certainly read of the\r\ndisconsolate lover who, on the death of her who ungratefully refused to\r\nreciprocate his affection, disinterred her body by stealth, supplied\r\nhimself with scanty provision, and embarking in a small boat, launched\r\nforth upon the wide waters, to watch her gradual decomposition till\r\nstarvation found them one common grave. I also knew an officer, who,\r\nhaving stuffed an old and faithful dog, and placed him on the\r\nmantel-piece, when his only child died soon after, earnestly entreated a\r\nsurgeon to stuff the child, that he might place it beside the faithful\r\ndog. Nevertheless, I cannot believe that such aberrations of human\r\nintellect are sufficiently frequent to make the Patent Metallic Coffin\r\nCompany a popular or profitable affair.\r\n\r\nAn important feature in a populous town is the means of conveyance,\r\nwhich here, in addition to hack cabs and omnibuses, includes railway\r\ncarriages. I would observe, once for all, that the horses of America, as\r\na whole, may be classed as enduring, wiry, and active hacks. You do not\r\nsee anything to compare with some of the beautiful nags that \"Rotten\r\nRow\" or Melton exhibits; but, on the other hand, you rarely see the\r\nlumbering, lolloping, heavy brutes so common in this country. Then,\r\nagain, a horse in this country is groomed and turned out in a style\r\nwhich I never saw in America, and therefore shows to much greater\r\nadvantage, in spite of the Yankee sometimes ornamenting his head with\r\nhairs from his tail; while on the other hand, though an Englishman\r\nconsiders a pair of nags that will go a mile in five minutes a great\r\nprize, no man in America who is a horse fancier would look at a pair\r\nthat could not do the same distance in four; nor would he think them\r\nworth speaking about, if they could not do the distance in a very few\r\nseconds over three minutes. On one side of the water, pace is almost the\r\nonly object; on the other side, shape and appearance are weighty\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the Americans being essentially gregarious, and business\r\nteaching the truism that a cent saved is a cent gained, hackney coaches\r\nare comparatively little used by the men; for it must be remembered that\r\nidlers in this country are an invisible minority of the community! The\r\nnatural consequence is, that they are clean and expensive. The drivers\r\nare charmingly independent and undeniably free-and-easy birds, but not\r\nmeaning to be uncivil. One of them showed his independence by asking two\r\ndollars one night for a three-mile drive home to the hotel. I inquired\r\nof the master, and found the proper charge was a dollar and a half;\r\nbut, on my sending out the same, Jarvey was too proud to confess he was\r\nwrong, and, refusing the money, drove off--nor did I ever hear more of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nTheir free-and-easiness can never be better exemplified than in the old\r\nanecdote told of so many people, from an ex-prince of France, downward;\r\nviz., the prince having ordered a hack cab, was standing at the door of\r\nthe hotel, smoking his cigar, and waiting for its arrival. When Cabby\r\ndrove up, judging from the appearance of the prince that he was \"the\r\nfare,\" he said, \"Are you the chap that sent for a cab?\" And, being\r\nanswered with an affirmative smile, he said, \"Well, get in; I guess I'm\r\nthe gentleman that's to drive you.\"\r\n\r\nThe next means of conveyance to be spoken of is the omnibus. I was told\r\nby a friend who had made inquiries on the subject, that there were\r\nupwards of a thousand, and that they pay twenty-two per cent. They are\r\ninfinitely better than ours, simply because they are broader: the most\r\nrotund embodiment of an alderman after a turtle-soup dinner, even if he\r\nhad--to use the emphatic language of Mr. Weller--been \"swellin'\r\nwisibly,\" could pass up the centre without inconvenience to the\r\npassengers on either side; and as a good dividend is a thing not to be\r\ndespised, they do not employ a \"cad\" behind. The door shuts by a strap\r\nrunning along the roof, with a noose in the end, which Jehu puts on his\r\nfoot. Any one wishing to alight pulls the strap; Jehu stops; and, poking\r\nhis nose to a pigeon-hole place in the roof, takes the silver fare; and,\r\nslipping the noose, the door is open to the human \"fare.\" Doubtless,\r\nthis effects a very great saving, and, dispensing with a cad in this\r\ncountry might enable the fares to be lowered; but I question if there be\r\nnot very many objections to our adopting the plan; and I should miss\r\nvery much that personification of pertness and civility, with his\r\ninquisitive eye, and the eccentric and perpetual gyrations of his fore\r\nfinger, which ever and anon stiffens in a skyward point, as though under\r\nthe magic influence of some unseen electro-biologist whose decree had\r\ngone forth--\"You can't move your finger, sir, you can't; no, you can't.\"\r\nI have only one grudge against the omnibuses in New York--and that is,\r\ntheir monopoly of Broadway, which would really have a very fine and\r\nimposing appearance were it not for them: they destroy all the\r\neffect, and you gradually begin to think it is the Strand grown wider,\r\ndespite of the magnificent palaces, hotels, &c., which adorn it on each\r\nside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A RAILWAY CARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\nThe last means of conveyance to be mentioned is the railway carriage,\r\nwhich--the city being built on a perfect flat--is admirably adapted for\r\nlocomotion. The rails are laid down in a broad avenue on each side of\r\nBroadway, and the cars are drawn by horses, some two, some four. Those\r\nthat are used for the simple town business have only two horses, and\r\nwill hold about twenty-four passengers; the others run from the lower\r\nend of the town to a place where the engine is waiting for them outside.\r\nThe town railway-car may be called a long omnibus, low on the wheels,\r\nbroad, airy, and clean inside, and, excessively convenient for getting\r\nin and out. There is a break at both ends, one under the charge of Jehu,\r\nthe other under the charge of the guard; so that, though trotting along\r\nat a good pace, they are very easily stopped. When they get to the end\r\nof the journey, the horses change ends, thus avoiding the necessity of\r\nany turning, the space required for which would have made a great\r\ndifference in the expense. For a busy, bustling city, on a flat, it is\r\nunquestionably by far the best conveyance, on account of carrying so\r\nmany, and being so handy for ingress and egress.\r\n\r\nThere was a strong push made to get one laid down in Broadway, and\r\ncorporation jobbery had nearly succeeded. For my own part, did I live in\r\nBroadway, if they would lay down a single line of rail, with shunters at\r\nintervals, to enable the cars to pass one another, and fix regular hours\r\nfor running, I should infinitely prefer it to the unlimited army of\r\nomnibuses that now block up the street; but I fancy the interests of the\r\nlatter are too deeply involved to be readily resigned.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of railway carriages, I may as well give you\r\na description of the travelling cars in ordinary use.\r\n\r\nThey are forty-two feet long, nine and a half wide, from six to six and\r\na half feet high, and carry from fifty to sixty passengers. Each seat is\r\nthree feet four inches long, placed at right angles to the window, and\r\nhas a reversible back. There is a passage through the centre of the car,\r\nbetween the rows of seats. In winter, a stove is always burning in each\r\ncarriage; and in one of them there is generally a small room\r\npartitioned off, containing a water-closet, &c. A door is placed at\r\neach extremity, outside which there is a platform whereon the break is\r\nfixed. These carriages are supported at each end by four wheels, of\r\nthirty-three inches diameter, fitted together in a frame-work, and\r\nmoving on a pivot, whereby to enable them to take more easily any sharp\r\nbend in the road. Their weight is from ten to twelve tons, and their\r\ncost from 400l. to 450l. sterling. The system of coupling adopted is\r\nalike rude and uncomfortable; instead of screwing the carriages tightly\r\nup against the buffers, as is the practice in England, they are simply\r\nhooked together, thus subjecting the passengers to a succession of jerks\r\nwhen starting, and consequently producing an equal number of concussions\r\nwhen the train stops.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing sketch, it will be seen that the narrowness of the\r\nseats is such as to prevent its two occupants--if of ordinary\r\ndimensions--from sitting together without rubbing shoulders. It will\r\nalso be observed, that the passage through the centre of the carriages\r\nenables any one to pass with ease throughout the whole length of the\r\ntrain. This is a privilege of which the mercurial blood and inquisitive\r\nmind of the American take unlimited advantage, rendering the journey one\r\ncontinued slamming of doors, which, if the homoeopathic principle be\r\ncorrect, would prove an infallible cure for headache, could the sound\r\nonly be triturated, and passed through the finest sieve, so as to reach\r\nthe tympanum in infinitesimal doses. But, alas! it is administered\r\nwholesale, and with such power, that almost before the ear catches the\r\nsound, it is vibrating in the tendon Achilles. It is said by some, that\r\nsalmon get accustomed to crimping; and I suppose that, in like manner,\r\nthe American tympanum gets accustomed to this abominable clatter and\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\nThe luggage-van is generally placed between the carriages and the\r\nengine. And here it is essential I should make some observations with\r\nreference to the ticket system which is universally adopted in America.\r\nEvery passenger is furnished with brass tickets, numbered, and a\r\nduplicate is attached to each article of luggage. No luggage is\r\ndelivered without the passenger producing the ticket corresponding to\r\nthat on the article claimed, the Company being responsible for any loss.\r\nThis system is peculiarly suited to the habits of the American\r\npeople, inasmuch as nine-tenths of them, if not more, upon arriving at\r\nthe end of their journey, invariably go to some hotel; and as each\r\nestablishment, besides providing an omnibus for the convenience of its\r\ncustomers, has an agent ready to look after luggage, the traveller has\r\nmerely to give his ticket to that functionary, thus saving himself all\r\nfurther trouble.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LOCOMOTIVE.]\r\n\r\nThe last, but not the least important, object connected with railways,\r\nremains yet to be mentioned--viz., the locomotive. Its driving-wheels\r\nare generally six feet and a half in diameter, the cylinder is sixteen\r\ninches in diameter, and has a stroke of twenty-two inches. But the point\r\nto which I wish to call especial attention, is the very sensible\r\nprovision made for the comfort of the engineer and stokers, who are\r\nthoroughly protected by a weather-proof compartment, the sides whereof,\r\nbeing made of glass, enable them to exercise more effective vigilance\r\nthan they possibly could do if they were exposed in the heartless manner\r\nprevalent in this country.\r\n\r\nFrom my subsequent experience in the railway travelling of the United\r\nStates, I am induced to offer the following suggestions for the\r\nconsideration of our legislature. First, for the protection of the old,\r\nthe helpless, or the desirous, an act should be passed, compelling every\r\nrailway company to supply tickets for luggage to each passenger applying\r\nfor them, provided that the said application be made within a given\r\nperiod previous to the departure of the train; this ticket to insure the\r\ndelivery of the luggage at the proper station, and to the proper owner.\r\n\r\nSecondly, an act compelling railway companies to afford efficient\r\nprotection from the weather to the engineer and stokers of every train,\r\nholding the chairman and board of directors responsible in the heaviest\r\npenalties for every accident that may occur where this simple and humane\r\nprovision is neglected.\r\n\r\nThirdly, an act requiring some system of communication between guard,\r\npassengers, and engineer. The following rude method strikes me as so\r\nobvious, that I wonder it has not been tried, until some better\r\nsubstitute be found. Let the guard's seat project in all trains--as it\r\nnow does in some--beyond the carriages, thus enabling him to see the\r\nwhole length of one side of the train; carry the foot-board and the\r\nhand-rail half way across the space between the carriages, by which\r\nsimple means the guard could walk outside from one end of the train to\r\nthe other, thus supervising everything, and gathering in the tickets _en\r\nroute_, instead of inconveniencing the public, as at present, by\r\ndetaining the train many minutes for that purpose.[D]\r\n\r\nNext, fit every carriage with two strong metal pipes, running just over\r\nthe doors, and projecting a foot or so beyond the length of the\r\ncarriage, the end of the pipe to have a raised collar, by which means an\r\nelastic gutta percha tube could connect the pipes while the carriages\r\nwere being attached; a branch tube of gutta percha should then be led\r\nfrom the pipe on one side into each compartment, so that any passenger,\r\nby blowing through it, would sound a whistle in the place appropriated\r\nto the guard. On the opposite side, the pipes would be solely for\r\ncommunication between the guard and engine-driver. Should the length of\r\nany train be found too great for such communication, surely it were\r\nbetter to sacrifice an extra guard's salary, than trifle with human life\r\nin the way we have hitherto done. Each engine should have a second\r\nwhistle, with a trumpet tone, similar to that employed in America, to be\r\nused in case of _danger_, the ordinary one being employed, as at\r\npresent, only to give warning of approach.\r\n\r\nWith these sagacious hints for the consideration of my countrymen, I\r\npostpone for the present the subject of railways, and, in excuse for the\r\nlength of my remarks, have only to plead a desire to make railway\r\ntravelling in England more safe, and my future wanderings more\r\nintelligible. I have much more to say with regard to New York and its\r\nneighbourhood; but not wishing to overdose the reader at once, I shall\r\nreturn to the subject in the pages, as I did to the place in my\r\nsubsequent travels.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote D: This power of supervision, on the part of the guard, might\r\nalso act as an effective check upon the operations of those swindling\r\ngamblers who infest many of our railroads--especially the express trains\r\nof the Edinburgh and Glasgow--in which, owing to no stoppage taking\r\nplace, they exercise their villanous calling with comparative impunity.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n_A Day on the North River_.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly one fine morning in October, a four-seated fly might have been\r\nseen at the door of Putnam's hotel, on the roof of which was being piled\r\na Babel of luggage, the inside being already full. Into another vehicle,\r\nour party--i.e., three of us--entered, and ere long both the carriages\r\nwere on the banks of the river, where the steamer was puffing away,\r\nimpatient for a start. The hawsers were soon cast off, and we launched\r\nforth on the bosom of the glorious Hudson, whose unruffled surface\r\nblazed like liquid fire beneath the rays of the rising sun. I purposely\r\nabstain from saying anything of the vessel, as she was an old one, and a\r\nvery bad specimen. The newer and better class of vessel, I shall have to\r\ndescribe hereafter.\r\n\r\nOn leaving New York, the northern banks of the river are dotted in every\r\ndirection with neat little villas, the great want being turf, to which\r\nthe American climate is an inveterate foe. Abreast of one of these\r\nvillas, all around me is now smiling with peace and gladness; alas! how\r\ndifferent was the scene but a few months previous; then, struggling\r\nbodies strewed the noble stream, and the hills and groves resounded with\r\nthe bitterest cries of human agony, as one of the leviathan steamers,\r\nwrapped in a fierce and fiery mantle, hurried her living cargo to a\r\nburning or a watery grave.\r\n\r\nWe had a motley collection of passengers, but were not overcrowded. Of\r\ncourse, there was a Paddy on board. Where can one go without meeting one\r\nof that migratory portion of our race! There he was, with his \"shocking\r\nbad hat,\" his freckled face, his bright eye, and his shrewd expression,\r\nsmoking his old \"dudeen,\" and gazing at the new world around him. But\r\nwho shall say his thoughts were not in some wretched hovel in the land\r\nof his birth, and his heart beating with the noble determination, that\r\nwhen his industry met its reward, those who had shared his sorrows in\r\nthe crowded land of his fathers, should partake of his success in the\r\nthinly-tenanted home of his adoption. Good luck to you, Paddy, with all\r\nmy heart!\r\n\r\nI was rather amused by a story I heard, of a newly-arrived Paddy\r\nemigrant, who, having got a little money, of course wanted a little\r\nwhisky. On going to the bar to ask the price, he was told\r\nthree-halfpence. \"For how much?\" quoth Paddy. The bottle was handed to\r\nhim, and he was told to take as much as he liked. Paddy's joy knew no\r\nbounds at this liberality, and, unable to contain his ecstasy, he rushed\r\nto the door to communicate the good news to his companions, which he did\r\nin the following racy sentence: \"Mike! Mike, my sowl! com' an' haf a\r\ndhrink--only thruppence for both of us, an' the botthel in yer own\r\nfisht!\"\r\n\r\nOne unfortunate fellow on board had lost a letter of recommendation, and\r\nwas in great distress in consequence. I hope he succeeded in replacing\r\nit better than a servant-girl is said to have done, under similar\r\ncircumstances, who--as the old story goes--having applied to the captain\r\nof the vessel, received the following doubtful recommendation at the\r\nhand of that functionary: \"This is to certify that Kate Flannagan had a\r\ngood character when she embarked at New York, but she lost it on board\r\nthe steamer coming up. Jeremiah Peascod, Captain.\"\r\n\r\nThe scenery of the Hudson has been so well described, and so justly\r\neulogized, that I need say little on that score. In short, no words can\r\nconvey an adequate impression of the gorgeousness of the forest tints in\r\nNorth America during the autumn. The foliage is inconceivably beautiful\r\nand varied, from the broad and brightly dark purple leaf of the maple,\r\nto the delicate and pale sere leaf of the poplar, all blending\r\nharmoniously with the deep green of their brethren in whom the vital sap\r\nstill flows in full vigour. I have heard people compare the Hudson and\r\nthe Rhine. I cannot conceive two streams more totally dissimilar--the\r\ndistinctive features of one being wild forest scenery, glowing with\r\never-changing hues, and suggestive of a new world; and those of the\r\nother, the wild and craggy cliff capped with beetling fortresses, and\r\nbanks fringed with picturesque villages and towns, all telling of feudal\r\ntimes and an old world. I should as soon think of comparing the castle\r\nof Heidelberg, on its lofty hill with Buckingham Palace, in its\r\nmetropolitan hole.--But to return to the Hudson.\r\n\r\nIn various places you will see tramways from the top of the banks down\r\nto the water; these are for the purpose of shooting down the ice, from\r\nthe lakes and ponds above, to supply the New York market. The ice-houses\r\nare made on a slope, and fronting as much north as possible. They are\r\nbuilt of wood, and doubled, the space between which--about a foot and a\r\nhalf--is filled with bark, tanned. In a bend of the river, I saw the\r\nindications of something like the forming of a dock, or basin; and, on\r\ninquiry, was told it was the work of a Company who imagined they had\r\ndiscovered where the famous pirate Kidd had buried his treasure. The\r\nCompany found to their cost, that it was they who were burying their\r\ntreasure, instead of Captain Kidd who had buried his; so, having\r\nrealized their mare's-nest, they gave it up. One of the most beautiful\r\n\"bits\" on the Hudson is West Point; but, as I purpose visiting it at my\r\nleisure hereafter, I pass it by at present without further comment.\r\n\r\nThere are every now and then, especially on the southern bank, large\r\nplots, which, at a distance, look exactly like Turkish cemeteries. On\r\nnearing them, you find that the old destroyer, Time, has expended all\r\nthe soil sufficiently to allow the bare rock to peep through, and the\r\ndisconsolate forest has retired in consequence, leaving only the funeral\r\ncypress to give silent expression to its affliction. Hark! what sound is\r\nthat? Dinner! A look at the company was not as _appétissant_ as a glass\r\nof bitters, but a peep at the _tout-ensemble_ was fatal; so, patience to\r\nthe journey's end. Accordingly, I consoled myself with a cigar and the\r\nsurrounding scenery; no hard task either, with two good friends to help\r\nyou. On we went, passing little villages busy as bees, and some looking\r\nas fresh as if they had been built over-night. At last, a little before\r\ndusk, Albany hove in sight. As we neared the wharf, it became alive with\r\nPaddy cabmen and porters of every age: the former, brandishing their\r\nwhips, made such a rush on board when we got within jumping distance,\r\nthat one would have thought they had come to storm the vessel. We took\r\nit coolly, allowing the rush of passengers to land first; and then,\r\nhaving engaged two \"broths of boys\" with hackney coaches, we drove up to\r\nthe Congress Hall Hotel, where, thanks to our young American cicerone,\r\nwe were very soon comfortably lodged, with a jolly good dinner before\r\nus. I may as well explain why it was thanks to our friend that we were\r\ncomfortably lodged.\r\n\r\n'Throughout the whole length and breadth of the Republic, the people are\r\ngregarious, and go everywhere in flocks; consequently, on the arrival of\r\nrailway train or steamer, 'buses from the various hotels are always in\r\nwaiting, and speedily filled. No sooner does the 'bus pull up, than a\r\nrush is made by each one to the book lying on the counter, that he may\r\ninscribe his name as soon as possible, and secure a bedroom. The duty of\r\nallotting the apartments generally devolves upon the head clerk, or\r\nchief assistant; but as, from the locomotive propensities of the\r\npopulation, he has a very extensive acquaintance, and knows not how soon\r\nsome of them may be arriving, he billets the unknown in the most\r\nout-of-the-way rooms; for the run upon all the decent hotels is so\r\ngreat, that courtesy is scarce needed to insure custom. Not that they\r\nare uncivil; but the confusion caused by an arrival is so great, and the\r\nmass of travellers are so indifferent to the comfort or the attention\r\nwhich one meets with in a decent hotel in this country, that, acting\r\nfrom habit, they begin by roosting their guests, like crows, at the top\r\nof the tree.\r\n\r\nTo obviate this inconvenience, I would suggest, for the benefit of\r\nfuture travellers, the plan I found on many occasions so successful\r\nmyself, in my subsequent journeys; which is, whenever you are\r\ncomfortably lodged in any hotel, to take a letter from the proprietor to\r\nthe next you wish to stop at. They give it you most readily, and on many\r\noccasions I found the advantage of it. They all know one another; and in\r\nthis way you might travel all through the Union.\r\n\r\nDinner is over--the events of the day have been discussed 'mid fragrant\r\nclouds, and we are asleep in the capital of the State of New York.\r\n\r\nWe were obliged to be astir early in the morning, so as to be in time\r\nfor the railway; consequently, our lionizing of the city consisted\r\nchiefly in smoking a cigar at the front-door. The town is prettily\r\nsituated on the banks of the Hudson, and at its confluence with the Erie\r\ncanal. It is one of the few towns in the Republic which enjoys a\r\nRoyalist name, having been called after the Duke of York and Albany,\r\nand is a very thriving place, with a steadily increasing population,\r\nalready amounting to sixty thousand; and some idea of its prosperity may\r\nbe formed from the fact of its receiving, by the Erie canal, annually,\r\ngoods to the value of near six millions sterling. Some years ago it was\r\nscourged by an awful fire; but it has risen, like a phoenix, from its\r\nashes, and profited materially by the chastisement. The chief objection\r\nI had to the town was the paving of the streets, which was abominable,\r\nand full of holes, any of them large enough to bury a hippopotamus, and\r\nthreatening dislocation of some joint at every step; thus clearly\r\nproving that the contract for the paving was in the hands of the\r\nsurgeons. On similar grounds, it has often occurred to me that the\r\nproprietors of the London cabs must be chiefly hatters.\r\n\r\nOur descent from the hotel to the railway station was as lively as that\r\nof a parched pea on a red-hot frying-pan, but it was effected without\r\nany injury requiring the assistance of the paving-surgeons, and by the\r\ntime our luggage was ticketed the train had arrived: some tumbled out,\r\nothers tumbled in; the kettle hissed, and off we went, the first few\r\nhundred yards of our journey being along the street. Not being\r\naccustomed to see a train going in full cry through the streets, I\r\nexpected every minute to hear a dying squeak, as some of the little\r\nurchins came out, jumping and playing close to the cars; but they seem\r\nto be protected by a kind of instinct; and I believe it would be as easy\r\nto drive a train over a cock-sparrow as over a Yankee boy. At last we\r\nemerged from the town, and went steaming away merrily over the country.\r\nOur companions inside were a motley group of all classes. By good\r\nfortune, we found a spare seat on which to put our cloaks, &c., which\r\nwas a luxury rarely enjoyed in my future travels, being generally\r\nobliged to carry them on my knee, as the American cars are usually so\r\nfull that there is seldom a vacant place on which to lay them.\r\n\r\nOur route lay partly along the line of the Mohawk, on the banks of which\r\nis situated the lovely village of Rockton, or Little Falls, where the\r\ngushing stream is compressed between two beautifully wooded cliffs,\r\naffording a water-power which has been turned to good account by the\r\nestablishment of mills. At this point the Erie canal is cut for two\r\nmiles through the solid rock, and its unruffled waters, contrasting\r\nwith the boiling river struggling through the narrow gorge, look like\r\nstreams of Peace and Passion flowing and struggling side by side. As the\r\n\"iron horse\" hurries us onward, the ears are assailed, amid the wild\r\nmajesty of Nature, with the puny cockneyisms of \"Rome,\" \"Syracuse,\" &c.\r\nSuch absurdities are ridiculous enough in our suburban villas; but to\r\nfind them substituted for the glorious old Indian names, is positively\r\npainful.\r\n\r\nAmong other passengers in the train, was a man conspicuous among his\r\nfellows for clean hide and clean dimity; on inquiry, I was told he was a\r\nProfessor. He looked rather young for a professorial chair, and further\r\ninvestigation confused me still more, for I found he was a _Professor of\r\nSoap_. At last, I ascertained that he had earned his title by going\r\nabout the country lecturing upon, and exhibiting in his person, the\r\nvaluable qualities of his detergent treasures, through which peripatetic\r\nadvertisement he had succeeded in realizing dollars and honours. The\r\noratory of some of these Professors is, I am told, of an order before\r\nwhich the eloquence of a Demosthenes would shrink abashed, if success is\r\nadmitted as the test; for, only put them at the corner of a street in\r\nany town, and I have no fears of binding myself to eat every cake they\r\ndo not sell before they quit their oratorical platform. The soapy orator\r\nquitted the train at Auburn, and soon after, the vandalism of \"Rome\" and\r\n\"Syracuse\" was atoned for by the more appropriate and euphonical old\r\nIndian names of \"Cayuga\" and \"Canandaigua.\"\r\n\r\nOn reaching the station of the latter, an old and kind friend to my\r\nbrother, when he first visited America, was waiting to welcome us to his\r\nhouse, which was about a quarter of a mile distant, and a most\r\ncomfortable establishment it proved, in every way. Our worthy host was a\r\nScotchman by birth, and though he had passed nearly half a century in\r\nthe United States, he was as thoroughly Scotch in all his ways as if he\r\nhad just arrived from his native land; and while enjoying his\r\nhospitalities, you might have fancied yourself in a Highland laird's old\r\nfamily mansion. In all his kind attentions, he was most ably assisted by\r\nhis amiable lady. Everything I had seen hitherto was invested with an\r\nair of newness, looking as if of yesterday: here, the old furniture and\r\nthe fashion thereof, even its very arrangement, all told of days long\r\nbygone, and seemed to say, \"We are heir-looms.\" When you went upstairs,\r\nthe old Bible on your bedroom table, with its worn cover, well-thumbed\r\nleaves, and its large paper-mark, browned by the hand of Time, again\r\nproclaimed, \"I am an heir-loom,\" and challenged your respect; and worthy\r\ncompanions they all were to mine host and his lady, who, while they\r\nwarmed your heart with their cheerful and unostentatious hospitality,\r\nalso commanded your respect by the way they dispensed it.\r\n\r\nThe following day our route lay across country, out of the line of stage\r\nor rail; so a vehicle had to be got, which my young American cicerone,\r\nunder the guidance of mine host, very soon arranged; and in due time, a\r\nlong, slight, open cart, with the seats slung to the sides, drove to the\r\ndoor, with four neat greys, that might have made \"Tommy Onslow's\" mouth\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nWhile they are putting in the luggage, I may as well give you a sketch\r\nof how the young idea is sometimes taught to shoot in this country.\r\nTime--early morning. Paterfamilias at the door, smoking a cigar--a lad\r\nof ten years of age appears.\r\n\r\n\"I say, father, can I have Two-forty?[E] I want to go down to the farm,\r\nto see my cattle fed!\"\r\n\r\nScarce had leave been obtained, before a cry was heard in another\r\nquarter. \"Hallo, Jemmy! what's the matter now? Wont Shelty go?\"\r\n\r\nThe youth so addressed was about six, and sitting in a little low\r\nfour-wheeled carriage, whacking away at a Shetland-looking pony, with a\r\ncoat, every hair of which was long enough for a horse's tail. The\r\ndifficulty was soon discovered, for it was an old trick of Shelty to\r\nlift one leg outside the shaft, and strike for wages, if he wasn't\r\npleased.\r\n\r\n\"Get out, Jemmy, I'll set him right;\" and accordingly, Shelty's leg\r\nwas lifted inside, and Paterfamilias commenced lunging him round and\r\nround before the door. After a few circles he said, \"Now then, Jemmy,\r\nget in again; he's all right now.\"\r\n\r\nThe infant Jehu mounts, and of course commences pitching into Shelty,\r\nalike vigorously and harmlessly; off they go at score.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going, Jemmy?\"\r\n\r\n\"What--say--father?\" No words are lost.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going, Jemmy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Going to get some turnips for my pigs;\" and Jemmy disappeared in a bend\r\nof the road.\r\n\r\nOn inquiry, I found Jemmy used often to go miles from home in this way,\r\nand was as well known in the neighbourhood as his father.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, I remember seeing three lads, the oldest about\r\ntwelve, starting off in a four-wheeled cart, armed with an old gun.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going, there?\"\r\n\r\n\"To shoot pigeons.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that sticking out of your pocket?\"\r\n\r\n\"A loaded pistol;\" and off they went at full swing.\r\n\r\nThinks I to myself, if those lads don't break their necks, or blow their\r\nbrains out, they will learn to take care of themselves; and I began to\r\nreflect whether this was the way they were taught to love independence.\r\n\r\nNow for a sketch of the other sex. Two horses come to the door\r\nside-saddled. Out rush, and on jump, two girls under twelve. Young Ten,\r\nupon his Two-forty, is the chaperon. \"Take care!\" says an anxious\r\nparent. \"Oh, I'm not afraid, mother;\" and away they go, galloping about\r\nthe park as if they were Persians. My mind turned involuntarily\r\nhomewards, and I drew a picture from life. A faithful nurse stands at\r\nthe door; a young lady about twelve is mounting; a groom is on another\r\nhorse, with a leading-rein strong enough to hold a line-of-battle ship\r\nin a gale of wind. The old nurse takes as long packing the young lady as\r\nif she were about to make a tour of the globe; sundry whispers are going\r\non all the time, the purport of which is easily guessed. At last all\r\nexcuses are exhausted, and off they go. The lady's nag jog-trots a\r\nlittle; the nurse's voice is heard--\"Walk, walk, that's a dear! walk\r\ntill you're comfortable in the saddle. William, mind you don't let go\r\nthe rein; is it strong enough?\" William smothers a laugh; the procession\r\nmoves funereally, the faithful nurse watching it with an expression\r\nbetokening intense anxiety. \"Take care, that's a dear!\" and then, as the\r\nobject of her solicitude disappears among the trees, she draws a long\r\nsigh; a mutter is heard--\"some accident\" are the only words\r\ndistinguishable; a bang of the door follows, and the affectionate nurse\r\nis--what?--probably wiping her eyes in the passage.\r\n\r\nHere are two systems which may be said to vary a little, and might\r\nrequire my consideration, were it not that I have no daughters, partly\r\nowing, doubtless, to the primary deficiency of a wife. At all events, I\r\nhave at present no time for further reflections; for the waggon is\r\nwaiting at the door, the traps are all in, and there stand mine host and\r\nhis lady, as ready to speed the parting as they were to welcome the\r\ncoming guest. A hearty shake of the hand, and farewell to Hospitality\r\nHall. May no cloud ever shade the happiness of its worthy inmates!\r\n\r\nAs we drive on, I may as well tell you that Canandaigua is a beautiful\r\nlittle village, situated on a slope descending towards a lake of the\r\nsame name, and therefore commanding a lovely view--for when is a sheet\r\nof water not lovely? There are some very pretty little villas in the\r\nupper part of the village, which is a long broad street, with trees on\r\neither side, and is peopled by a cozy little community of about four\r\nthousand. Here we are in the open country. What is the first novelty\r\nthat strikes the eye?--the snake fences; and a tickler they would prove\r\nto any hot-headed Melton gentleman who might try to sky over them. They\r\nare from six to seven feet high--sometimes higher--and are formed by\r\nlaying long split logs one over another diagonally, by which simple\r\nprocess the necessity of nails or uprights is avoided; and as wood is\r\ndirt-cheap, the additional length caused by their diagonal construction\r\nis of no importance;--but, being all loose, they are as awkward to leap\r\nas a swing-bar, which those who have once got a cropper at, are not\r\nanxious to try again.\r\n\r\nIt is at all times a cheery thing to go bowling along behind a spicy\r\nteam, but especially so when traversing a wild and half-cultivated\r\ncountry, where everything around you is strange to the eye, and where\r\nthe vastness of space conveys a feeling of grandeur; nor is it the less\r\nenjoyable when the scenery is decked in the rich attire of autumn, and\r\nseen through the medium of a clear and cloudless sky. Then, again, there\r\nis something peculiarly pleasing while gazing at the great extent of\r\nrich timbered land, in reflecting that it is crying aloud for the\r\nstalwart arm of man, and pointing to the girdle of waving fields which\r\nsurround it, to assure that stalwart arm that industry will meet a sure\r\nreward. Poverty may well hide her head in shame amid such scenes as\r\nthese, for it can only be the fruit of wilful indolence.\r\n\r\nThe farm cottages are all built of wood, painted white, and look as\r\nclean and fresh as so many new-built model dairies. The neat little\r\nchurches, too, appeared as bright as though the painters had left them\r\nthe evening before. And here I must remark a convenience attached to\r\nthem, which it might be well to imitate in those of our own churches\r\nwhich are situated in out-of-the-way districts, such as the Highlands of\r\nScotland, where many of the congregation have to come from a\r\nconsiderable distance. The convenience I allude to is simply a long,\r\nbroad shed, open all one side of its length, and fitted with rings, &c.,\r\nfor tethering the horses of those who, from fancy, distance, age, or\r\nsickness, are unwilling or unable to come on foot. The expense would be\r\nbut small, and the advantage great. Onward speed our dapper greys, fresh\r\nas four-year-olds; and the further we go, the better they seem to like\r\nit. The only bait they get is five minutes' breathing time, and a great\r\nbucket of water, which they seem to relish as much as if it were a\r\nmagnum of iced champagne. The avenue before us leads into Geneseo, the\r\nplace of our destination, where my kind friend, Mr. Wadsworth, was\r\nwaiting to welcome us to his charming little country-place, situated\r\njust outside the village. 'And what a beautiful place is this same\r\nGeneseo! But, for the present, we must discharge our faithful greys--see\r\nour new friends, old and young--enjoy a better bait than our nags did at\r\nthe half-way house, indulge in the fragrant Havana, and retire to roost.\r\nTo-morrow we will talk of the scenery.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote E: As a similar expression occurs frequently in this work, the\r\nreader is requested to remember that it is a common custom in America to\r\nname a horse according to the time in which he can trot a mile. The boy\r\nevidently had a visionary idea in his mind that the little hack he was\r\nasking permission to ride, had accomplished the feat of trotting a mile\r\nin two minutes and forty seconds.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n_Geneseo_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a lovely bright autumn morning, with a pure blue sky, and a pearly\r\natmosphere through which scarce a zephyr is stealing; the boughs of the\r\ntrees hang motionless; my window is open; but, how strange the perfect\r\nstillness! No warbling note comes from the feathered tribe to greet the\r\nrising sun, and sing, with untaught voice, their Maker's praise; even\r\nthe ubiquitous house-sparrow is neither seen nor heard. How strange this\r\ncomparative absence of animal life in a country which, having been so\r\nrecently intruded upon by the destroyer--man--one would expect to find\r\nsuperabundantly populated with those animals, against which he does not\r\nmake war either for his use or amusement. Nevertheless, so it is; and I\r\nhave often strolled about for hours in the woods, in perfect solitude,\r\nwith no sound to meet the ear--no life to catch the eye. But I am\r\nwandering from the house too soon;--a jolly scream in the nursery\r\nreminds me that, at all events, there is animal life within, and that\r\nthe possessor thereof has no disease of the lungs.\r\n\r\nLet us now speed to breakfast; for folk are early in the New World, and\r\ndo not lie a-bed all the forenoon, thinking how to waste the afternoon,\r\nand then, when the afternoon comes, try and relieve the tedium thereof\r\nby cooking up some project to get over the _ennui_ of the evening.\r\nWhatever else you may deny the American, this one virtue you must allow\r\nhim. He is, emphatically, an early riser; as much so as our own\r\nmost gracious Sovereign, whose example, if followed by her\r\nsubjects--especially some in the metropolis--would do more to destroy\r\nLondon hells, and improve London health, than the Legislature, or Sir B.\r\nHall, and all the College of Surgeons, can ever hope to effect among the\r\npost-meridian drones.\r\n\r\nBreakfast was speedily despatched, and Senor Cabaños y Carvajal followed\r\nas a matter of course. While reducing him to ashes, and luxuriating in\r\nthe clouds which proclaim his certain though lingering death, we went\r\nout upon the terrace before the house to wish good speed to my two\r\ncompanions who were just starting, and to enjoy a view of the far-famed\r\nvale of Genesee. Far as the eye could see, with no bounds save the power\r\nof its vision, was one wide expanse of varied beauty. The dark forest\r\nhues were relieved by the rich tints of the waving corn; neat little\r\ncottages peeped out in every direction. Here and there, a village, with\r\nits taper steeples, recalled the bounteous Hand \"that giveth us all\r\nthings richly to enjoy.\" Below my feet was beautifully undulating park\r\nground, magnificently timbered, through which peeped the river, bright\r\nas silver beneath the rays of an unclouded sun, whose beams, streaming\r\nat the same time on a field of the rich-coloured pumpkin, burnished each\r\nlike a ball of molten gold. All around was richness, beauty, and\r\nabundance.\r\n\r\nThe descendant of a Wellington or a Washington, while contemplating the\r\nglorious deeds of an illustrious ancestor, and recalling the adoration\r\nof a grateful country, may justly feel his breast swelling with pride\r\nand emulation; but while I was enjoying this scene, there stood one at\r\nmy side within whom also such emotions might be as fully and justly\r\nstirred--for there are great men to be found in less conspicuous, though\r\nnot less useful spheres of life. A son who knew its history enjoyed with\r\nme this goodly scene. His father was the first bold pioneer. The rut\r\nmade by the wheel of his rude cart, drawn by two oxen, was the first\r\nimpress made by civilization in the whole of this rich and far-famed\r\nvalley. A brother shared with him his early toils and privations; their\r\nown hands raised the log-hut--their new home in the wilderness. Ere they\r\nbroke ground, the boundless forest howled around a stray party of\r\nIndians, come to hunt, or to pasture their flocks on the few open plots\r\nskirting the river: all else was waste and solitude. One brother died\r\ncomparatively early; but the father of mine host lived long to enjoy the\r\nfruit of his labours. He lived to see industry and self-denial\r\nmetamorphose that forest and its straggling Indian band into a land\r\nbursting with the rich fruits of the soil, and buzzing with a busy hive\r\nof human energy and intelligence. Yes; and he lived to see temple after\r\ntemple, raised for the pure worship of the True God, supplant the\r\nignorance and idolatry which reigned undisturbed at his first coming.\r\nSay, then, reader, has not the son of such a father just cause for\r\npride--a solemn call to emulation? The patriarchal founder of his family\r\nand their fortunes has left an imperishable monument of his greatness in\r\nthe prosperity of this rich vale; and Providence has blessed his\r\nindividual energies and forethought with an unusual amount of this\r\nworld's good things. \"Honour and fame--industry and wealth,\" are\r\ninscribed on the banner of his life, and the son is worthily fighting\r\nunder the paternal standard. The park grounds below the house bear\r\nevidence of his appreciation of the beauties of scenery, in the taste\r\nwith which he has performed that difficult task of selecting the groups\r\nof trees requisite for landscape, while cutting down a forest; and the\r\nmost cursory view of his library can leave no doubt that his was a\r\nhighly-cultivated mind. I will add no more, lest I be led insensibly to\r\ntrench upon the privacy of domestic life.\r\n\r\nI now propose to give a slight sketch of his farm, so as to convey, to\r\nthose interested, an idea of the general system of agriculture adopted\r\nin the Northern States; and if the reader think the subject dull, a turn\r\nof the leaf will prove a simple remedy.\r\n\r\nThe extent farmed is 2000 acres, of which 400 are in wood, 400 in\r\nmeadow, 400 under plough, and 800 in pasture. On the wheat lands, summer\r\nfallow, wheat, and clover pasture, form the three years' rotation. In\r\nsummer fallow, the clover is sometimes ploughed in, and sometimes fed\r\noff, according to the wants of the soil and the farm. Alluvial lands are\r\ncultivated in Indian corn from five to ten years successively, and then\r\nlaid down in grass indeterminately from three to forty years.\r\nWheat--sometimes broadcast, sometimes drilled--is put in as near as\r\npossible the 1st of September, and cut from the 10th to the 20th of\r\nJuly. Clover-seed is sown during March in wheat, and left till the\r\nfollowing year. Wheat stubble is pastured slightly; the clover, if\r\nmowed, is cut in the middle of June; if pastured, the cattle are turned\r\nin about the 1st of May.\r\n\r\nPumpkins are raised with the Indian corn, and hogs fattened on them;\r\nduring the summer they are turned into clover pasture. Indian corn and\r\npumpkins are planted in May, and harvested in October; the leaf and\r\nstalk of the Indian corn are cut up for fodder, and very much liked.\r\nOats and barley are not extensively cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe average crop of Indian corn is from fifty to sixty bushels, and of\r\nwheat, from twenty-five to thirty per acre. The pasture land supports\r\none head to one and one-third acre. Grass-fattened cattle go to market\r\nfrom September to November, fetching 2-1/4d. per lb. live weight, or\r\n4-1/2d. per lb. for beef alone. Cattle are kept upon hay and straw\r\nfrom the middle of November to 1st of May, if intended for fattening\r\nupon grass; but, if intended for spring market, they are fed on Indian\r\ncorn-meal in addition. Sheep are kept on hay exclusively, from the\r\nmiddle of November to the 1st of April. A good specimen of Durham ox,\r\nthree and a half years old, weighs 1500 lbs. live weight. The farm is\r\nprovided with large scales for weighing hay, cattle, &c., and so\r\narranged, that one hundred head can easily be weighed in two hours.\r\n\r\nNo manure is used, except farm-pen and gypsum; the former is generally\r\napplied to Indian corn and meadow land. The gypsum is thrown, a bushel\r\nto the acre, on each crop of wheat and clover--cost of gypsum, ten\r\nshillings for twenty bushels. A mowing machine, with two or three horses\r\nand one man, can cut, in one day, twelve acres of heavy meadow land, if\r\nit stand up; but if laid at all, from six to ten. The number of men\r\nemployed on the farm is, six for six months, twelve for three months,\r\nand twenty-five for three months. Ten horses and five yoke of oxen are\r\nkept for farm purposes. The common waggon used weighs eight\r\nhundredweight, and holds fifty bushels. Sometimes they are ten\r\nhundredweight, and hold one hundred and five bushels.\r\n\r\nThe wages of the farm servants are:--For those engaged by the year,\r\n2l. 10s. a month; for six months, 2l. 18s. 6d. a month; for\r\nthree months, 3l. 11s. a month--besides board and lodging, on the\r\nformer of which they are not likely to find their bones peeping through\r\ntheir skin. They have meat three times a day--pork five days, and mutton\r\ntwo days in the week--a capital pie at dinner; tea and sugar twice a\r\nday; milk _ad libitum_; vegetables twice a day; butter usually three\r\ntimes a day; no spirits nor beer are allowed. The meals are all cooked\r\nat the farm, and the overseer eats with the men, and receives from\r\n75l. to 125l. a year, besides board and lodging for his family, who\r\nkeep the farm-house. When every expense is paid, mine host netts a\r\nclear six per cent. on his farm, and I think you will allow that he may\r\ngo to bed at night with little fear of the nightmare of a starving\r\nlabourer disturbing his slumbers. Not that he troubles sleep much, for\r\nhe is the nearest thing to perpetual motion I ever saw, not excepting\r\neven the armadillo at the Zoological Gardens, and he has more \"irons in\r\nthe fire\" than there were bayonet-points before Sevastopol.\r\n\r\nThe village contains a population of two thousand inhabitants, and\r\nconsists of a few streets, the principal of which runs along a terrace,\r\nwhich, being a continuation of the one on which we were lately standing,\r\ncommands the same lovely view. But, small as is the village, it has four\r\nchurches, an academy, two banks, two newspaper offices, and a telegraph\r\noffice. What a slow coach you are, John Bull!\r\n\r\nOne day I was taking a drive with an amiable couple, who, having been\r\nmarried sixteen or seventeen years, had got well over the mysterious\r\ninfluences of honeymoonism. The husband was acting Jarvey, and I was\r\ninside with madame. The roads being in some places very bad, and neither\r\nthe lady nor myself being feather-weight, the springs were frequently\r\nbrought down upon one another with a very disagreeable jerk. The lady\r\nremonstrated:\r\n\r\n\"John, I declare these springs are worn out, and the carriage itself is\r\nlittle better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Susan, what's the good of your talking that way; you know they are\r\nperfectly good, my dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, John! you know what I say is true, and that the carriage has never\r\nbeen touched since we married.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear, if I prove to you one of your assertions is wrong, I suppose\r\nyou will be ready to grant the others may be equally incorrect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what then?\" said the unsuspecting wife.\r\n\r\n\"Why, my dear, I'll prove to you the springs are in perfectly good\r\norder,\" said the malicious husband, who descried a most abominable bit\r\nof road ready for his purpose; and, suiting the action to the word, he\r\nput his spicy nags into a hand-canter. Bang went the springs together;\r\nand, despite of all the laws of gravitation, madame and I kept bobbing\r\nup and down, and into one another's laps.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, John, stop! stop!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, my dear, I shall go on till you're perfectly satisfied with\r\nthe goodness of the springs and the soundness of the carriage.\"\r\n\r\nResistance was useless; John was determined, and the horses would not\r\nhave tired in a week; so the victim had nothing for it but to cry\r\n_peccavi_, upon which John moderated his pace gradually, and our elastic\r\nbounds ceased correspondingly, until we settled once more firmly on our\r\nrespective cushions; then John turned round, and, with a mixed\r\nexpression of malice and generosity, said, \"Well, my dear, I do think\r\nthe carriage wants a new lining, but you must admit they are really good\r\nsprings.\" And the curtain fell on this little scene in the drama of\r\n\"Sixteen Years after Marriage.\" May the happy couple live to re-enact\r\nthe same sixty years after marriage!\r\n\r\nOur drive brought us to the shore of Lake Canesus, and a lovely scene it\r\nwas; the banks were in many places timbered to the water's edge by the\r\nvirgin forest, now radiant with the rich autumnal tints; the afternoon\r\nsun shone forth in all its glory from a cloudless sky, on a ripp'less\r\nlake, which, like a burnished mirror, reflected with all the\r\ntruthfulness of nature the gorgeous scene above; and as you gazed on the\r\nazure abyss below, it kept receding and receding till the wearied sight\r\nof the creature was lost in the fathomless depths of the work of his\r\nAlmighty Creator. Who has not for the moment imagined that he could\r\nrealise the infinity of space, as, when gazing at some bright star, he\r\nstrives to measure the distance of the blue curtain spread behind,\r\nwhich, ever receding, so mocks the efforts of the ambitious eye, that\r\nits powers become bewildered in the unfathomable depths of immensity;\r\nbut I am not sure whether such feelings do not come home to one more\r\npowerfully when the eye gazes on the same object through the medium of\r\nreflection;--for, as with the bounties of the Creator, so with the\r\nwonders of His creation--man is too prone to undervalue them in\r\nproportion to the frequency with which they are spread before him; and\r\nthus the deep azure vault, so often seen in the firmament above, is less\r\nlikely to attract his attention and engage his meditations, than when\r\nthe same glorious scene lies mirrored beneath his feet.\r\n\r\nThis charming lake has comparatively little cultivation on its borders;\r\ntwo or three cottages, and a few cattle grazing, are the only signs that\r\nman is asserting his dominion over the wilderness. One of these\r\ncottages belongs to a member of the Wadsworth family, who owns some\r\nextent of land in the neighbourhood, and who has built a nice little\r\nboat for sailing about in the summer season. I may as well mention in\r\nthis place, that the roofing generally used for cottages is a wooden\r\ntile called \"shingle,\" which is very cheap--twelve-and-sixpence\r\npurchasing enough to cover a thousand feet.\r\n\r\nWhile driving about in this neighbourhood, I saw, for the first time,\r\nwhat is termed a \"plank-road,\"--a system which has been introduced into\r\nthe United States from Canada. The method of construction is very\r\nsimple, consisting of two stringers of oak two inches square, across\r\nwhich are laid three-inch planks eight feet long, and generally of\r\nhemlock or pine. No spiking of the planks into the stringers is\r\nrequired, and a thin layer of sand or soil being placed over all, the\r\nroad is made; and, as the material for construction is carried along as\r\nthe work progresses, the rapidity of execution is astonishing. When\r\ncompleted, it is as smooth as a bowling-green. The only objection I ever\r\nheard to these roads is, that the jarring sensation produced by them is\r\nvery injurious to the horses' legs; but it can hardly be thought that,\r\nif the cart were up to the axle and the horse up to the belly-band in a\r\ngood clay soil, any advantage would be derived from such a primitive\r\nstate of things. Taking an average, the roads may be said to last from\r\neight to ten years, and cost about £330 a mile. Those in Canada are\r\noften made much broader, so as to enable two vehicles to pass abreast,\r\nand their cost is a little above £400 a mile. The toll here is about\r\nthree-farthings a mile per horse. They have had the good sense to avoid\r\nthe ridiculous wheel-tollage to which we adhere at home with a tenacity\r\nonly equalled by its folly, as if a two-wheeled cart, with a ton weight\r\nof cargo, drawn by a Barclay and Perkinser, did not cut up a road much\r\nmore than the little four-wheel carriage of the clergyman's wife, drawn\r\nby a cob pony, and laden with a tin of soup or a piece of flannel for\r\nsome suffering parishioner. But as our ancestors adopted this system \"in\r\nthe year dot, before one was invented,\" I suppose we shall bequeath the\r\nprecious legacy to our latest posterity, unless some \"Rebecca League,\"\r\nsimilar to Taffy's a few years since, be got up on a grand national\r\nscale, in which case tolls may, perhaps, be included in the tariff of\r\nfree-trade. Until that auspicious event take place,--for I confess to an\r\never-increasing antipathy to paying any gate,--we might profit in some\r\nof our bleak and dreary districts by copying the simple arrangement\r\nadopted at many American tolls, which consists of throwing a covered\r\narchway over the road; so that if you have to unbutton half-a-dozen\r\ncoats in a snow-storm to find a sixpence, you are not necessitated to\r\nbutton-in a bucketful of snow, which, though it may cool the body, has a\r\nvery opposite effect on the temper.\r\n\r\nIt is bad enough in England; but any one who wishes to enjoy it to\r\nperfection had better take a drive from Stirling, crossing the Forth,\r\nwhen, if he select his road happily, he may have the satisfaction of\r\npaying half-a-dozen tolls in nearly as many minutes, on the plea that\r\nthis piece of ground, the size of a cocked-hat-box,--and that piece, the\r\nsize of a cabbage-garden,--and so on, belong to different counties; and\r\nhis amusement may derive additional zest if he be fortunate enough to\r\nfind the same tollman there whom I met some years ago. When passing his\r\ntoll in a driving snow-storm that penetrated even to the very marrow, I\r\npulled up a few yards beyond the gate, upon which he came out very\r\nsulkily, took the half-crown I tendered him, and, walking deliberately\r\nback, placed the change on the post of the gate, and said,--\"If ye want\r\n'ut, ye may take 'ut; it's no my place to walk half a mile o' the road\r\nto gie folk their change;\" after which courteous address he disappeared,\r\nbanging his door to with a sound that fell on the ear very like \"Put\r\nthat in your pipe and smoke it.\" Precious work I had, with a heavy\r\ndog-cart, no servant, and a hack whose mouth was case-hardened. I would\r\nwillingly have given it up; but I knew the brute (the man, not the\r\nhorse) would very soon have got drunk upon it; so I persevered until I\r\nsucceeded, and then went on my road full of thoughts which are, I fear,\r\ntotally unfit to be committed to paper.\r\n\r\nReader, I must ask you to forgive my wanderings on the banks of the\r\nForth. I hasten back to Geneseo, and pack up ready for to-morrow's\r\nstart, for the days I had spent with my kind host and his merry family\r\nhad slipped by so pleasantly I had quite lost count of them. There was\r\nbut one cloud to our enjoyment--one sad blank in the family group: my\r\nsister-in-law, in whose charming society I had fondly hoped to make my\r\nfirst visit to the scenes of her early youth, had been recently summoned\r\nto a better world; and the void her absence made in that family circle,\r\nof which she was both the radiating and the centring point of affection,\r\nwas too deeply felt for aught but time ever to eradicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n_Stirring Scenes and Strange Sights_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy host having kindly lent me his carriage and a pair of wiry nags, I\r\nstarted for Batavia to meet the railway. The distance was about thirty\r\nmiles, and the road in many places execrable--in one part so bad that we\r\nhad to go through a quarter of a mile of wood, as it was absolutely\r\nimpassable;--yet, despite all these hindrances, and without pressing the\r\nhorses in the least, we completed the distance in the three hours,\r\nincluding from five to ten minutes at a half-way house, where we gave\r\nthem the usual American bait of a bucket of cold water; and when we\r\narrived they were as fresh as four-year-olds, and quite ready to return\r\nif need had been. I saw nothing worth remarking during the drive. There\r\nwas plenty of cultivated land; and plenty of waste, waiting to reward\r\nthe labourer. All the little villages had their daguerreotype shops\r\nexcept one, and there the deficiency was supplied by a perambulating\r\nartist in a tented cart.\r\n\r\nWhen a railway crosses the road, you are expected to see it,--the only\r\nwarning being a large painted board, inscribed \"Look out for the Train.\"\r\nIf it be dark, I suppose you are expected to guess it; but it must be\r\nremembered that this is the country of all countries where every person\r\nis required to look after himself. The train coming up soon after my\r\narrival, I went on to Buffalo, amid a railway mixture of\r\ntag-rag-and-bobtail, squalling infancy and expectorating manhood. On\r\narriving at the terminus, I engaged a cab, and, after waiting half an\r\nhour, I found that Jarvey was trying to pick up some other \"fare,\" not\r\nthinking myself and my servant a sufficient cargo to pay well. I tried\r\nto find a railway official; but I might almost as well have looked for a\r\nflea in a flower-garden--no badges, no distinctive marks, the station\r\nfull of all the riff-raff of the town;--it was hopeless. At last, by a\r\nlucky accident, I saw a man step into a small office, so I bolted after\r\nhim, like a terrier after a badger, but I could not draw him; he knew\r\nnothing about the cabs--he was busy--nay, in short, he would not be\r\nbothered. Having experienced this beautiful specimen of Buffalo railway\r\nmanagement, I returned to the open air and lit my cigar. After some\r\ntime, Cabby, having found that no other \"fare\" was to be had,\r\ncondescended to tell me he was ready; so in I got, and drove to the\r\nhotel, on entering which I nearly broke my neck over a pyramid of boxes,\r\nall looking of one family. They turned out to be the property of Mr.\r\nG.V. Brooke, the actor, who had just arrived \"to star it\" at Buffalo.\r\nSupper being ready, as it always is on the arrival of the evening train,\r\nI repaired thither, and found the usual wondrous medley which the\r\nAmerican tables d'hôte exhibit, the usual deafening clatter, the usual\r\nprofusion of eatables, the usual rapidity of action, and the usual\r\ndisagreeable odour which is consequent upon such a mass of humanity and\r\nfood combined. Being tolerably tired, I very soon retired to roost.\r\n\r\nWhat a wondrous place is this Buffalo!--what a type of American activity\r\nand enterprise! I had visited it in the year 1826, and then it had only\r\nthree thousand inhabitants. The theatre, I remember, amused me\r\nimmensely, the stage and accommodation for spectators barely occupying\r\nan area of twenty-five feet square. Mr. G.V. Brooke's boxes, at that\r\ntime, would have filled the whole house; and here they are in 1852,\r\ndrawing our metropolitan stars to their boards. Their population has\r\nincreased twenty-fold, and now exceeds sixty thousand; a splendid\r\nharbour, a lighthouse, piers, breakwater, &c., have been constructed,\r\nand the place is daily increasing. Churches rear their spiry steeples in\r\nevery direction. Banks and insurance offices are scattered broadcast.\r\nEducational, literary, and benevolent establishments abound, and upwards\r\nof a dozen newspapers are published. Land which, during my visit in\r\n1826, you might almost have had for the asking, is now selling at two\r\nhundred guineas the foot of frontage for building. Even during the last\r\nten years, the duties collected at the port have increased from £1000 to\r\nnearly £14,000. In the year 1852 upwards of four thousand vessels,\r\nrepresenting a million and a half of tonnage, cleared at the harbour,\r\nand goods to the value of nearly seven millions sterling arrived from\r\nthe lakes, the greater portion of the cargoes being grain. The value of\r\ngoods annually delivered by Erie Canal is eight millions. Never was a\r\nmore energetic hive of humanity than these \"Buffalo lads;\" and they are\r\ngoing ahead every day, racing pace.\r\n\r\nNow, John Bull, come with me to the cliff outside the town, and\r\noverhanging the Niagara river. Look across the stream, to the Canada\r\nshore, and you will see a few houses and a few people. There they have\r\nbeen, for aught I know, since the creation. The town(!) is called\r\nWaterloo, and the couple of dozen inhabitants, despite the rich fruits\r\nof industry on which they may gaze daily, seem to regard industry as a\r\nfrightful scourge to be studiously avoided. Their soil is as rich as, if\r\nnot richer than, that on the opposite shore: the same lake is spread\r\nbefore them, and the same river runs by their doors. It does, indeed,\r\nlook hopeless, where such an example, constantly under their eyes, fails\r\nto stir them up to action. But, perhaps, you will say, you think you see\r\na movement among the \"dry bones.\" True, my dear Bull, there is now a\r\nmovement; but, if you inquire, you will find it is a Buffalo movement.\r\nIt is their energy, activity, and enterprise which, is making a railway\r\nto run across Canada to Goderich, by which means they will save, for\r\ntraffic, the whole length of Lake Erie, and half that of Lake Huron, for\r\nall produce coming from the North of Michigan, Wisconsin, &c. So\r\nthoroughly is it American enterprise, that, although the terminus of the\r\nrailway is at Waterloo, the name is ignored; and Buffalo enterprise\r\nhaving carried forward the work, it is styled the \"Buffalo, Brentford,\r\nand Goderich Line.\" Truly, John Bull, your colony shows very badly by\r\nthe side of this same Buffalo. Let us hope increasing intercourse may\r\ninfuse a little vitality into them.\r\n\r\nThe train is starting for Niagara, and I am in it, endeavouring to recal\r\nthe impressions of 1826, which, being but very dim, my anticipations\r\npartake of the charm of novelty. While in the middle of a seventh heaven\r\nof picturative fancy, the screeching of the break announces the\r\njourney's end. As I emerge from the motley group of fellow-passengers, a\r\nsound, as of very distant thunder heard through ears stuffed with\r\ncotton, is all that announces the neighbourhood of the giant cataract. A\r\nfly is speedily obtained, and off I start for the hotel on the Canadian\r\nside. Our drive took us along the eastern bank till we reached the\r\nsuspension-bridge which spans the cliffs of the river. Across this\r\ngossamer causeway, vehicles are required to walk, under a heavy penalty\r\nfor any breach of this rule. The vibration when walking is not very\r\ngreat; but, going at a quick pace, it would undoubtedly be considerable,\r\nand might eventually loosen those fastenings on which the aerial pathway\r\ndepends. Arrived at the other side, I was quite taken aback on being\r\nstopped by an official. I found he was merely a _pro formâ_ custom-house\r\nofficer. Not having been schooled in the Old World, he showed none of\r\nthe ferret, and in a few seconds I was again trotting southwards along\r\nthe western bank to the Clifton House Hotel. The dull work of life is\r\ndone, the cab is paid, my room is engaged, and there I am, on the\r\nbalcony, alone, with the roaring of the cataract in my ears and the\r\nmighty cataract itself before my eyes.\r\n\r\nWhat were my first impressions?--That is a difficult question.\r\nCertainly, I did not share that feeling of disappointment which some\r\npeople take pains to express. Such people, if they had dreamt that an\r\nunknown friend had left them 100,000l., would feel disappointed if he\r\nawoke and found a legacy of 90,000l. lying on their table; or,\r\nperhaps, they give expression to their feelings, by way of inducing the\r\npublic to suppose that their fertile imaginations conceived something\r\nfar grander than this most glorious work of Nature. If a man propose to\r\ngo to Niagara for mere beauty, he had better stay at home and look at a\r\nlily through a microscope; if to hear a mighty noise, he had better go\r\nwhere the anchors are forged in Portsmouth dockyard; if to see a mighty\r\nstruggle of waters, he had better take a cruise, on board a pilot-boat,\r\nin the Bay of Biscay, during an equinoctial gale; but, if he be content\r\nto see the most glorious cataract his Maker has placed upon our globe;\r\nif, in a stupendous work of Nature, he have a soul to recognise the\r\nAlmighty Workman; and if, while gazing thereon, he can travel from\r\nNature up to Nature's God; then, let him go to Niagara, in full\r\nassurance of enjoying one of the grandest and most solemnizing scenes\r\nthat this earth affords. It wants but one qualification to be perfect\r\nand complete; that, it had originally when fresh from the hands of its\r\nDivine Maker; and of that man has rifled it--I mean solitude.--Palace\r\nhotels are very convenient things; energy and enterprise are very\r\nvaluable qualities, and natural features of American character which I\r\nadmire; but, seeing how universally everything is sacrificed to the\r\nuseful and dollar-making, I dread to contemplate the future: for visions\r\nrise before me of the woodman's axe levelling the forest timber on Goat\r\nIsland, which at present shrouds the town; and fancy pictures a line of\r\nvillas, shops, and mills, ending in a huge hotel, at the edge of the\r\ncataract. I trust my vision may never be realized. But my hopes are\r\nsmall; for I invariably observed that, in clearing ground, scarce any\r\nattention had been paid to aught else but the best method of getting the\r\nbest return for the labour bestowed.\r\n\r\nNow, reader, I have not told you as yet what my impressions were, as I\r\nstood on the balcony gazing at Niagara; and, I pray you take not\r\noffence, when I add that I have not the slightest intention of trying to\r\nrecord them. Writing frankly, as I feel, I have said enough for you to\r\nglean something of the turn they took, and to see that they were\r\nimpressions which a pen is too feeble an agent adequately to express. I\r\nshall not tax your patience with Table Rock and Goat Island points of\r\nview, American and Canadian falls, the respective beauties of the\r\nStraight Line and the Horse-shoe; I do not purpose clothing you in\r\nMackintosh, and dragging you with trembling steps along the slimy\r\npathway between the Falls and the rock, to gaze on the sun through the\r\nroaring and rolling flood; nor will I draw upon your nerves by a detail\r\nof the hair-breadth escapes of Mr. Bumptious and Mrs. Positive, who,\r\nwhen they got half-way along the said path, were seized with panic, and\r\nonly escaped a header into the boiling caldron by lying flat on their\r\nstomachs until the rest of the party had lionized the whole distance,\r\nwhen the guide returned and hauled them out by the heels, like drowned\r\nrats out of a sink-hole; nor will I ask you to walk five miles with me,\r\nto see the wooden hut, built over a sulphur spring within ten feet of\r\nthe river, and which is lit by the sulphuretted hydrogen gas thereof,\r\nled through a simple tube.\r\n\r\nAll these, and the rapids above, and the whirlpool below, and the\r\nfour-and-a-half million horse-power of the Falls, have been so often\r\ndescribed by abler pens and more fertile imaginations, that the effort\r\nwould be a failure and the result a bore.\r\n\r\nI have in my possession a collection from the various albums at\r\nNiagara; it opens with the following lines by Lord Morpeth, now Earl of\r\nCarlisle--\r\n\r\n  \"There's nothing great or bright, thou glorious Fall!\r\n  Thou may'st not to the fancy's sense recal;\r\n  The thunder-riven cloud, the lightning's leap,\r\n  The stirring of the chambers of the deep,\r\n  Earth's emerald green, and many-tinted dyes,\r\n  The fleecy whiteness of the upper skies,\r\n  The tread of armies thickening as they come,\r\n  The boom of cannon and the beat of drum,\r\n  The brow of beauty and the form of grace,\r\n  The passion and the prowess of our race,\r\n  The song of Homer in its loftiest hour,\r\n  The unresisted sweep of human power,\r\n  Britannia's trident on the azure sea,\r\n  America's young shout of liberty!\r\n  Oh! may the waves that madden in thy deep,\r\n  There spend their rage, nor climb the encircling steep,--\r\n  And till the conflict of thy surges cease,\r\n  The nations on thy banks repose in peace!\"\r\n\r\nThere are other effusions equally creditable to their authors; but there\r\nis also a mass of rubbish, from which I will only inflict two specimens.\r\nOne, evidently from the pen of a Cockney; and the other, the poetical\r\ninspiration of a free and enlightened.\r\n\r\nCockney poet--\r\n\r\n  \"Next to the bliss of seeing Sarah,\r\n  Is that of seeing Niagara.\"\r\n\r\nFree and enlightened--\r\n\r\n  \"Of all the roaring, pouring,\r\n    Spraying streams that dash,\r\n  Niagara is Number One,\r\n    All to immortal smash!\"\r\n\r\nNot desiring to appear to as great disadvantage as either of the two\r\nlast-quoted writers, I decline the attempt; and, while saving myself,\r\nspare the public.\r\n\r\nI think, reader, that I have a claim upon your gratitude for not\r\nexpatiating at greater length upon a theme from which it were easy to\r\nfill chapter upon chapter; for, if you are generous, you will throw a\r\nveil over the selfish reasons that have produced so happy a result. I\r\nwill only add one piece of advice, which is, if the pleasure of\r\nvisiting Niagara would be enhanced by a full larder and a ruck of\r\npeople, go there \"during the season;\" but if your pleasure would be\r\ngreater in visiting it when the hotel is empty, even though the larder\r\nbe nearly in the same state, follow my example, and go later in the\r\nyear, by which means you will partially obtain that quiet, without\r\nwhich, I freely confess, I never care to look upon \"The Falls\" again.\r\n\r\nA formidable rival to this magnificent fall of water has-been discovered\r\nby that indefatigable traveller, Dr. Livingston. It is called the\r\nMosiotunya Falls, which are thus described:--\"They occur,\" we read\r\n(\"Outlines of Dr. Livingston's Missionary Journeys,\" p. 19), \"in the\r\nmost southerly part of the Zambese. Although previously unvisited by any\r\nEuropean, Dr. Livingston had often heard of these smoke-resounding\r\nfalls, which, with points of striking difference from Niagara, are, if\r\npossible, more remarkable and not less sublime than that noble cataract.\r\nHe was therefore anxious to inspect them, and on the 20th of November,\r\n1855, he reached Kalai, a place eight miles west of the Falls. On\r\narriving at the latter, he found that this natural phenomenon was caused\r\nby the sudden contraction, or rather compression, of the river, here\r\nabout 1000 yards broad, which urges its ponderous mass through a narrow\r\nrent in the basaltic rock of not more than twenty-five yards, and down a\r\ndeep cleft, but a little wider, into a basin or trough about thirty\r\nyards in diameter, lying at a depth of thirty-five yards. Into this\r\nnarrow receptacle the vast river precipitated itself. When Dr.\r\nLivingston visited the spot, the Zambese flowed through its narrowest\r\nchannel, and its waters were at their lowest. The effect, however, of\r\nits sudden contraction and fall was in the highest degree sublime, and,\r\nfrom the point at which he surveyed it, appalling. For, not satisfied\r\nwith a distant view of the opening through its rocky barrier, and of the\r\ncolumns of vapour rushing up for 300 to 400 feet, forming a spreading\r\ncloud, and then falling in perpetual rain, he engaged a native, with\r\nnerves as strong as his own and expert in the management of the canoe,\r\nto paddle him down the river, here heaving, eddying, and fretting, as if\r\nreluctant to approach the gorge and hurl itself down the precipice to an\r\nislet immediately above the fall, and from one point of which he could\r\nlook over its edge into the foaming caldron below, mark the mad whirl\r\nof its waters, and stand in the very focus of its vapoury columns and\r\nits deafening roar. But unique and magnificent as was the cataract when\r\nDr. Livingston beheld it, the reports of others, and the inference drawn\r\nby himself, satisfied him that the spectacle was tame compared with what\r\noccurs during the rainy season, when the river flows between banks many\r\nmiles apart, and still forces its augmented waters through the same\r\nfissure into the same trough. At these times the columns of spray may be\r\nseen, and the sound heard ten or twelve miles distant.\"\r\n\r\nMy traps are all in the ferry-boat: I have crossed the river, been wound\r\nup the opposite bank, paid my fare, and am hissing away for Rochester.\r\nWhat thoughts does Rochester give rise to? If you are a commercial man,\r\nyou will conjure up visions of activity and enterprise; if you are an\r\ninquirer into mysteries and manners, your dreams will be of\r\n\"spirit-rapping and Bloomers.\" Coming fresh from Buffalo, I confess I\r\nwas rather interested in the latter. But here I am at the place itself,\r\nand lodged in an hotel wonderfully handy to the station; and before the\r\nfront door thereof railways are interlaced like the meshes of a\r\nfisherman's net. Having no conversable companion, I take to my ever\r\nfaithful and silent friend, the fragrant cigar, and start for a stroll.\r\nThere is a bookseller's shop at the corner; I almost invariably feel\r\ntempted to stop when passing a depôt for literature, especially in a\r\nstrange place; but on the present occasion a Brobdignagian notice caught\r\nmy eye, and gave me a queer sensation inside my waistcoat--\"Awful smash\r\namong the Banks!\" Below, in more Lilliputian characters, followed a list\r\nof names. I had just obtained notes of different banks for my travelling\r\nexpenses, and I knew not how many thereof might belong to the bankrupt\r\nlist before me; a short examination sufficed, and with a quieted mind, I\r\ncontinued my stroll and my cigar.\r\n\r\nThe progress of Rochester has not been so rapid as that of Buffalo; in\r\n1826 they made a pretty fair start, and at present Rochester has only a\r\nlittle above forty thousand, while, as we said a few pages back, Buffalo\r\nhas sixty thousand. Rochester has the disadvantage of not being built\r\nquite on the lake, as Buffalo may be said to be; moreover, the carrying\r\non Lake Ontario is not so great as on Lake Erie. Both towns enjoy the\r\nrich advantages of the Erie canal, and Rochester is benefited by\r\nwater-power in a way Buffalo is not. Genesee river, in a distance of\r\nthree miles, falls nearly two hundred and thirty feet, and has three\r\ncascades, the greatest of which is upwards of one hundred feet; this\r\npower has not been overlooked by the Rochesterians, who have established\r\nenormous flour-mills in consequence, using up annually three million\r\nbushels of wheat. As one of the Genesee falls was close to the town, I\r\nbent my steps thither; the roads were more than ankle deep in mud, and I\r\nhad some difficulty in getting to the spot; when there, the dreary\r\nnakedness of the banks and the matter-of-factism of a huge mill, chased\r\neven the very thought of beauty from my mind: whether man stripped the\r\nbanks, or Nature, I cannot say, but I should rather \"guess\" it was man.\r\n\r\nI was puddling back full of disappointment, and had just got upon the\r\nwooden pavement, which is a trottoir upon the plank-road system, when I\r\nsaw a strange sail ahead, with rather a novel rig; could it be?--no!\r\nyes!--no! yes!--yes, by George! a real, living Rochester Bloomer was\r\nsteering straight for me. She was walking arm-in-arm with a man who\r\nlooked at a distance awfully dirty; upon closer examination, I found the\r\neffect was produced by his wearing all his face-hair close clipped, like\r\na hunter's coat in the season: but I had but little time to spare upon\r\n_him_--the Bloomer was the star of attraction: on she came with a pretty\r\nface, dark hair, eyes to match, and a good figure; she wore a black\r\nbeaver hat, low crown, and broad brim; round the hat was tied, in a\r\nlarge bow, a bright red ribbon: under a black silk polka, which fitted\r\nto perfection, she had a pair of chocolate-coloured pantaloons, hanging\r\nloosely and gathered in above the ankles, and a neat pair of little feet\r\nwere cased in a sensible pair of boots, light, but at the same time\r\nsubstantial. A gap occurring in the trottoir, and the roads being\r\nshockingly muddy, I was curious to see how Bloomer faced the difficulty;\r\nit never seemed to give her a moment's thought: she went straight at it,\r\nand reached the opposite side with just as much ease as her companion.\r\n\r\nNow, reader, let us change the scene and bring before you one with which\r\nyou are probably not unfamiliar. Place--A muddy crossing near a parish\r\nschool. Time--Play hours. _Dramatis personae_--An old lady and twenty\r\nschool-boys. Scene--The old lady comes sailing along the footways,\r\ndoing for nothing that for which sweepers are paid; arrived at the\r\ncrossing, a cold shudder comes over her as she gazes in despair at the\r\nsea of mud she must traverse; behold now the frantic efforts she is\r\nmaking to gather up the endless mass of gown, petticoats, and\r\nauxiliaries with which custom and fashion have smothered her; her hands\r\ncan scarcely grasp the puckers and the folds; at last she makes a start,\r\nexhibiting a beautifully filled pair of snow-white stockings; on she\r\ngoes, the journey is half over; suddenly a score of urchin voices are\r\nheard in chorus, \"Twig her legs, twig her legs.\" The irate dame turns\r\nround to reprove them by words, or wither them with a glance; but alas!\r\nin her indignation she raises a threatening hand, forgetful of the\r\nimportant duties it was fulfilling, and down go gown, petticoats, and\r\nauxiliaries in the filthy mire; the boys of course roar with\r\ndelight--it's the jolliest fun they have had for many a day; the old\r\nlady gathers up her bundle in haste, and reaches the opposite side with\r\na filthy dress and a furious temper. Let any mind, unwarped by prejudice\r\nand untrammelled by custom, decide whether the costume of the Rochester\r\nBloomer or of the old lady be the more sensible.\r\n\r\nI grant that I have placed before you the two extremes, and I should be\r\nas sorry to see my fair friends in \"cut o' knee\" kilts, as I now am to\r\nsee them in \"sweep-the-ground gowns,\" &c. \"But,\" cries one, \"you will\r\naim a blow at female delicacy!\" A blow, indeed! when all that female\r\ndelicacy has to depend upon is the issue of a struggle between pants and\r\npetticoats, it will need no further blow: it is pure matter of fashion\r\nand custom. Do not girls wear a Bloomer constantly till they are\r\nfourteen or fifteen, then generally commence the longer dress? And what\r\nreason can be given but custom, which, in so many articles of dress, is\r\never changing? How long is it since the dressing of ladies' hair for\r\nCourt was a work of such absurd labour and nicety, that but few artists\r\nwere equal to the task, and, consequently, having to attend so many\r\ncustomers, ladies were often obliged to have their hair dressed the day\r\nbefore, and sit up all night that the coiffure might remain perfect? Or\r\nhow long is it since ladies at Court used to move about like human\r\nballoons, with gowns hooped out to such an extent that it was a work of\r\nlabour and dexterity to get in and out of a carriage; trains, &c., to\r\nmatch? Hundreds of people, now living, can not only remember these\r\nthings, but can remember also the outcry with which the proposal of\r\nchange was received. Delicacy, indeed! I should be glad to know what our\r\nworthy grandmammas would think of the delicacy of the present generation\r\nof ladies, could they but see them going about with nothing but an\r\noyster-shell bonnet stuck at the back of their heads! Take another\r\nremnant of barbarism, handed down to us in the shape of powder. Masters\r\nhave taken care of themselves, and got rid of the abomination; so have\r\nupper servants; but so wedded are some people to the habit, that they\r\nstill continue to pay a poll-tax of 1l. 3s. 6d. for the pleasure\r\nof powdering and plastering their footmen's heads, as if they had just\r\nescaped from a flour-mill and passed a greasy hand over their hair: will\r\nany one deny, that the money spent in the tax would promote \"John's\"\r\ncomfort and cleanliness much more, if expended in good baths, brown\r\nWindsor, and small-tooth combs.\r\n\r\nPardon me, reader, I feel that there is no analogy between a Bloomer and\r\na small-tooth comb; it is from following out the principle of recording\r\nthe reflections which what I saw gave rise to, that I have thus wandered\r\nback to the old country; with your permission, we are again at\r\nRochester, and the Bloomer has gone out of sight round the corner.\r\n\r\nThe shades of evening having closed in upon me, I retired to roost. My\r\nhead was snugly bedded in my pillow; I was in that charmingly doubtful\r\nstate in which thoughts and dreams have become imperceptibly blended.\r\nSuddenly there was a trumpet-blast, loud as a thunder-clap, followed by\r\nbells ringing as rapidly as those of the churches in Malta; as these\r\ndied away, the hum of human voices and the tread of human feet along the\r\npassages followed, and then all was once more hushed in silence. I\r\nturned over, gave the clothes an extra jerk, and again sought the land\r\nof dreams. Vain and delusive hope!--trains seemed starting or arriving\r\nevery half-hour, and the whole night was spent 'mid the soothing\r\nvarieties of mineral trumpets and bells, and animal hoofs and tongues,\r\ntill from sheer exhaustion, about five A.M., I dropped off into a\r\nsnooze, which an early start rendered it necessary to cut short soon\r\nafter seven.\r\n\r\nMem.--What a nice thing it is to put up at an hotel quite handy to a\r\nrailway station.\r\n\r\nReader, you are doubtless aware that Rochester is on Lake Ontario, and a\r\nconsiderable distance from New York; but I must nevertheless beg you to\r\ntransport yourself to the latter place, without going through the\r\nhumdrum travelling routine of--stopped here, stopped there, ate here,\r\nate there, which constituted the main features of my hasty journey\r\nthither, undertaken for the purpose of seeing my brother off, on his\r\nreturn to Europe, which duty bringing me within the yachting waters of\r\nNew York, I think this a legitimate place for a chapter on the \"Black\r\nMaria.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n_Construction and Destruction_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Black Maria\" is a vessel so unique in every respect, that the most\r\ndetailed description of her cannot but be most interesting to all\r\nyachting men; and, so far from apologizing for the length of my\r\nobservations, I would rather crave indulgence for the scanty information\r\nwhich this chapter will afford; but as it must prove pre-eminently dull\r\nto those who are ignorant of such matters, I would entreat them to pass\r\nit over, lest, getting through the first page, their ideas become\r\nbewildered, and, voting me a bore, they throw down the book, subjoining\r\na malediction upon my poor innocent head.\r\n\r\nThe following notes were furnished me by Commodore Stevens and his\r\nbrother, who were the designers and builders of this extraordinary\r\nyacht, and I therefore can vouch for their accuracy.\r\n\r\nIn case the term \"centre-board\" should be unknown to my reader, it may\r\nbe as well to explain that it means a board passing longitudinally\r\nthrough the keel, above which a strong water-tight case is fixed for its\r\nreception; it is raised and lowered by hand or by machinery, according\r\nto its weight. The advantages proposed by the centre-board are--the\r\nstability it gives to the vessel on a wind when let down; the resistance\r\nit removes if, when running before the wind, it be raised; the small\r\ndraught of water which the vessel requires, thereby enabling her to keep\r\nclose in-shore out of the influence of strong tides, &c.; and, lastly,\r\nthe facility for getting afloat again, by merely raising the\r\ncentre-board, should she take the ground. To proceed with the notes:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CUTTER YACHT \"BLACK MARIA.\"\r\n\r\nDisplacement, 145 tons.\r\n\r\nDraught of water on straight keel, 5 feet 2 inches.\r\n\r\nLength of straight keel, 60 feet, then running away in a curving line\r\nupwards, till at the bow it draws 10 inches.\r\n\r\nLength of centre-board, 24 feet.\r\n\r\nTotal depth of ditto, 15 feet; weight, 7 tons.\r\n\r\nForemost end of ditto, about 8 feet abaft the foremost end of straight\r\nkeel.\r\n\r\nWhen let down, it descends 10 feet at the further end, and 8 feet at the\r\nforemost. It is made of oak, with sufficient lead let in to make it\r\nsink. By an ingenious mechanical contrivance one man is enabled to raise\r\nand lower it with perfect facility.\r\n\r\nThere is another centre-board abaft, about 10 feet from the stern, which\r\nis 8 feet long, with a total depth of 9 feet, and, when down, extending\r\n5 feet below the keel.\r\n\r\nLength over all, 113 feet.\r\n\r\nThe extreme beam is 26-1/2 feet at 40 feet from the rudder-post running\r\naft to about 19 feet at taffrail; forward, it decreases about 20 inches\r\nwhen abreast of mast, thence runs away sharp to about four feet at the\r\nbow.\r\n\r\nThe mainmast is placed about 5 feet abaft the end of straight keel; it\r\nis 92 feet long, housing 8 feet: the diameter in the partners is 32\r\ninches, tapering off to 23 inches at the hounds. The mast is made of\r\nwhite pine, the centre of it is bored out, for the lowest twenty feet\r\nabout 12 inches diameter--the next 20 feet, 10 inches diameter--the next\r\n20 feet, 8 inches, and the remainder 7 inches. This was done to make the\r\nmast lighter, and, by the circulation of air, enable it to season\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe main boom is 95 feet long[F] and made like a cask. The staves are 31\r\nin number, of white pine, 2-1/4 inches thick; the staves are of\r\ndifferent lengths, so as to vary the points at which they respectively\r\nabut. The extreme length of boom is obtained by two lengths of the\r\nstaves; small cogs of wood are let in at intervals, half in one stave\r\nand half in its neighbour, so as to keep them from drawing, the whole\r\nbound together with strong hoops fitted with screws. The extreme\r\ndiameter of the boom is 26 inches where the sheets are fixed, tapering\r\noff at the jaws, and 13 inches at the boom end. To give additional\r\nsupport to the boom, an iron outrigger, extending about 3 feet on each\r\nside thereof, is fixed where the boom-sheets are placed, and a strong\r\niron brace extends from the jaws through the outrigger to the boom\r\nend. The gaff is of spruce, 61 feet long and 9 inches diameter.\r\n\r\nThe bowsprit is of white pine, 38 feet long, 18 of which is outboard;\r\nthe remainder comes under the deck, is let in to each beam, and abuts\r\nagainst the bitts: it is 24 inches diameter, and bored out like the\r\nmast, from 10 inches diameter at the heel to 7 at the end. The jibboom\r\nis made of two pieces of yellow pine, grooved out and hooped together;\r\nit is about 70 feet long and about 8 inches in diameter; the foot of the\r\njib is laced to this spar on hooks (when required).\r\n\r\nThe mainsail is made with the seams horizontal, to avoid the resistance\r\nperpendicular seams in so large a sail would offer to the wind. It has\r\nbeen calculated that the resistance of perpendicular seams, in a sail of\r\nthis size, is equal to that of a plank 10 inches broad and 60 feet long,\r\nplaced on end broadside to the wind; the luff of the sail is 66 feet;\r\nthe foot, 93; the head, 50; the head and foot of the sail are laced to\r\nbattens under gaff and on boom; the luff is brought to the mast by a\r\ncontrivance as original as it is perfect; two battens are fixed on\r\nafterpart of the mast, about an inch and a half apart, the inner parts\r\nshod with iron, and rather broader than the exterior opening. To each\r\neyelet-hole of the sail a strong brass-plate is fixed, having 4 rollers\r\ntraversing fore and aft, and 2 transversely; these plates, as the sail\r\ngoes up, are slipped into the grooves of the battens, the rollers\r\npreventing friction, and the battens keeping the luff fixed to the after\r\ncentre line of the mast--without this ingenious arrangement the huge\r\nmast would, if on a wind, becalm at least three feet of the sail--three\r\nlazy-jacks are fitted to support the huge mass of canvas when lowering\r\nthe sail.\r\n\r\nThe jib is 69 feet in the hoist, and 70 in the foot.\r\n\r\nThe bobstays are of solid iron, running 8 feet on each side of the keel,\r\nand going through a strong iron cap over the bowsprit end, where, a\r\nstrong iron washer being put on, they are securely fixed with a nut.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that there is a slight discrepancy between some of the\r\nmeasurements which I have given, and those which are marked on the\r\nprint; I place confidence in those I have received direct from the\r\nfountain-head; the difference is, however, so trifling, as scarce to\r\nneed any notice. I regret omitting to obtain the length of the\r\nafter-leech of the mainsail, and of the head of the jib; but I think the\r\nprint, which I believe to be very accurate, would justify me in\r\nconcluding that the former is about 110 feet and the latter about 120\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BLACK MARIA.]\r\n\r\nAssuming those calculations to be correct--and they cannot be very far\r\nwrong--the mainsail would contain about 5790 square feet, and the jib\r\nabout 2100 square feet. When it is remembered that the largest sail in\r\nthe British Navy only contains 5480 square feet, some conception may be\r\nformed of their gigantic proportions.\r\n\r\nThe gallant commodore was kind enough to trip his anchor and give me a\r\nshort cruise. Unfortunately, there was scarcely a breath of wind; but\r\neven under the influence of such scanty propelling power, the way she\r\nshot through the water, like a dolphin in full cry, was perfectly\r\nmarvellous; and the ease with which she came round, and the incredible\r\ndistance she shot ahead in stays, was, if possible, more astonishing\r\nstill; she steered as easy as a jolly-boat; or if, when running, a puff\r\nmade her refractory, by dropping the after centre-board she became as\r\ndocile as a lamb. My only regret was that I could not see her under the\r\nhigh pressure of a good snorter. Of course, any salt-water fish will\r\nhave long since discovered that this wonderful yacht is a leviathan\r\nplaything, and totally unfit to withstand the most moderate gale,\r\nespecially if any sea were running. What she might do if she were\r\nsparred, as other vessels of her tonnage usually are, I cannot pretend\r\nto say; but my yachting friends need never expect to see her, with her\r\npresent rig, re-enacting the \"America,\" hurling friendly defiance at the\r\nR.Y.C., and carrying off the crown of victory in their own waters.\r\n\r\nBut if any of my Cowes friends are anxious to test the powers of the\r\n\"Maria,\" the gallant commodore will be happy to accommodate them,\r\nand--as he expressed it to me--will further rejoice at having an\r\nopportunity of returning some of the many hospitalities which made his\r\nshort stay in England so agreeable to him. The only complaint I heard\r\nhim make of the rules of the yachting at Cowes, was the want of some\r\nrestriction as to vessels entering shallow water, by which omission a\r\nyacht with a light draught of water is enabled sometimes to draw ahead\r\nof her competitors by simply hugging the land out of the full swing of\r\nthe tide, while others are forced, from their deeper draught of water,\r\nto struggle against its full force. As, in my humble opinion, the\r\nobservation is a perfectly just one, I insert it here for the\r\nconsideration of those whom it may concern.\r\n\r\nThe accommodation on board is not nearly so good as in an English yacht,\r\npartly owing to the little height between decks, consequent upon her\r\nvery small draught of water, and partly owing to the great space taken\r\nup by the case for the centre-board; besides which, it should be\r\nremembered that a yacht is not used as a home in America in the same way\r\nas in England. The great, and, I might almost say, the only quality,\r\ntransatlantic yachtsmen care about is speed; and I think my yachting\r\nfriends at Cowes must admit that they have proved that they know how to\r\nattain their end, and that Mr. Steers, the builder of the \"America,\" is\r\nsecond to none in his craft; unless the \"Black Maria\" some future day\r\nassume a practicable rig, and, crossing the Atlantic, earn the victor's\r\nlaurels, in which case Steers will have to yield the palm to the worthy\r\nfraternity, who are at one and the same time the owners, builders, and\r\nsailers of the subject of this chapter.\r\n\r\nI believe it is very generally considered that the wind-up of a day's\r\nsport is by no means the least enjoyable portion of the twenty-four\r\nhours, when it comes in the shape of good fellowship and good cheer; and\r\nupon the present occasion we had both alike undeniable of their kind.\r\nThe commodore's cellar is as rich a rarity in its way as the Bernal\r\ncollection, and, from the movement of the corks, I should imagine it was\r\nupon an equally large scale. I do not purpose inflicting a bill of fare\r\nupon you; but, having, in the foregoing pages, made a promise to furnish\r\nthe proper recipe for Toddy and Chowder, I consider this the proper\r\nplace to redeem that promise, under the guidance of my hospitable host,\r\nwho initiated me fully into the mysteries of mixture, proportion, &c.,\r\nby making both before me.\r\n\r\nWhether it is of great importance to adhere exactly to the recipes, I\r\ncannot pretend to say; the soup was pronounced on all hands to be most\r\nexcellent, and some of the knowing ones declared it was unusually good.\r\nWe afterwards found out a good reason for its superior excellence. It\r\nappears that the commodore had given some instructions to the steward,\r\nwhich he evidently had not understood, for, upon asking that functionary\r\ntowards the end of dinner for a bottle of fine old Madeira which had\r\nbeen kept back as a bonnebouche, he gave a wild stare-of astonishment,\r\nand said he had put it all into the chowder. This little addition, I can\r\ntestify, most certainly did not spoil it. The toddy was not subject to\r\nany such unwarrantable addition; and, if I may judge from the quantity\r\ntaken by my neighbours, they all found it as delicious a drink as I did\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n_Recipes_.\r\n\r\nTODDY.--4 tumblers of water: 1 ditto, sugar: peel of 5 lemons, and\r\ndessert spoon of the juice: add a few pieces of peach and pine-apple,\r\nand some strawberries. Quarter of an hour before use, throw in 2\r\ntumblers of old rum and a lump or two of block ice.\r\n\r\nCHOWDER.--Saucepan ready, frizzle pork and onions till quite brown; put\r\na layer at bottom of the saucepan--saucerful;--on that, a layer of\r\nmashed potatoes--soup-plateful;--on that, raw sea-bass,[G] cut in lumps\r\n4 lbs.;--on that, pork and onions as before;--add half a nutmeg,\r\nspoonful of mace, spoonful of cloves, and double that quantity of thyme\r\nand summer savory; another layer of mashed potatoes, 3 or 4 Crackers,[H]\r\nhalf a bottle of ketchup, half a bottle of claret, a liberal pinch of\r\nblack, and a small pinch of red pepper. Just cover this with boiling\r\nwater, and put it on the fire till the fish is cooked.\r\n\r\nThe gallant commodore and his brother are now employed in building an\r\niron bomb-proof floating battery, four hundred feet long, intended as a\r\nharbour defence. What guns she is destined to mount is a question which\r\nhas not been definitively settled.\r\n\r\nIn so large a community as that of New York, the supply of water forms a\r\nsubject of the highest importance, especially when the rapid increase of\r\nthe population is taken into account. Some conception of this\r\nextraordinary increase may be formed from the statistical fact that the\r\ncity, which in the year of Independence contained only 35,000\r\ninhabitants, has now 850,000, if the suburbs are included; nearly\r\n4000 vessels enter the port annually, bearing merchandise valued at\r\n25,500,000l., and bringing 300,000 emigrants, of whom one-third are\r\nIrish and one-third German. The tonnage of New York is upwards of a\r\nmillion, or equal to one-fourth of that of the whole Union: the business\r\nof the city gives employment to upwards of fifty banks. Religion is\r\nrepresented by 250 churches, of which 46 are Presbyterian, and 45 are\r\nEpiscopalian. The Press sends forth 155 papers, of which 14 are\r\npublished daily and 58 weekly.\r\n\r\nThis short sketch will suffice to show that the city required a supply\r\nof water upon a gigantic scale. The difficulties were increased by the\r\nsituation of the town, which is built upon the eastern extremity of an\r\nisland--Manhattan--fourteen miles long and two broad, the highest point\r\nof which is but two hundred and thirty-eight feet above the level of the\r\nsea. Various plans for supplying water had been attempted without\r\nsuccess, and the health of the population was suffering so much in\r\nconsequence, that at last American energy, which here had been long\r\ndormant, rose like a giant refreshed and commenced that imperishable\r\nmonument, the Croton aqueduct.[I]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to convey any idea of this stupendous work without\r\nfigures; but I will endeavour to draw upon your patience as little as\r\npossible. My authority is a work published by Mr. Schramke in English,\r\nFrench, and German, and full of explanatory details and plans, &c. Mr.\r\nSchramke being one of the corps of engineers employed upon the work, I\r\nconclude his statements are peculiarly accurate. Long discussions,\r\npatient investigations, and careful surveys, combined to fix the\r\nposition for commencing operations upon the Croton river, forty and a\r\nhalf miles from New York, and five miles below a small lake of the same\r\nname. All the preliminaries had been hitherto carried on under the\r\nsuperintendence of Major Douglas, professor of engineering at the\r\nMilitary Academy at West Point; but, owing to some disagreements, Mr.\r\nJ.B. Jervis was the engineer eventually selected to carry out the\r\nundertaking. It is but just to mention his name, as the skill exhibited\r\nentitles him to lasting fame. By the construction of a substantial\r\ndam, the water was raised 40 feet, and a collecting reservoir formed, of\r\n500,000,000 gallons, above the level that would allow the aqueduct to\r\ndischarge 35,000,000 gallons a day. This stupendous work consists of a\r\ncovered way seven feet broad and eight feet and a half high; in its\r\ncourse it has to pass through sixteen tunnellings, forming an aggregate\r\nof nearly 7000 feet; to cross the river Harlem by a bridge 1450 feet\r\nlong and 114 feet above tide water, and to span various valleys. The\r\nreceiving reservoir outside the town gives a water surface of 31 acres,\r\nand contains 150,000,000 gallons; it is divided into two separate\r\ncompartments, so that either may be emptied for cleansing or repair.\r\nFrom this point the water is carried on, by three 36-inch pipes, to the\r\ndistributing reservoir, which is 386 feet square and 42 feet deep, but\r\nfilled generally to the depth of 38 feet, and then holding 21,000,000\r\ngallons. From this point it radiates throughout the city by means of 134\r\nmiles of pipes, varying in size from 4 to 36 inches. There is an average\r\nfall of 14 inches in the mile; and the supply, if required, can be\r\nincreased to 60,000,000 gallons daily. The total cost was 2,500,000l.;\r\nthe revenue derived from it is 100,000l. a year, moderate-sized houses\r\npaying 2l., and others in proportion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF THE CROTON AQUEDUCT.\r\n\r\n(_From Schramke's Description of the New York Croton Aqueduct_.)]\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would observe that this grand work is entitled to\r\nnotice from the skill displayed by the engineers, the quantity of the\r\nsupply, and the quality of the article, which latter is nearly as good\r\nas sherry cobbler--not quite. If my reader has been inveigled into\r\nreading the foregoing details, and has got bored thereby, a gallon of\r\nCroton water is an admirable antidote; but, as that may not be\r\navailable, I would suggest a cobbler, and another page or two; the\r\nlatter upon the principle adopted by indiscreet drinkers, of \"taking a\r\nhair of the dog that bit them.\"\r\n\r\nThe concluding passage of the last paragraph reminds me of a practice\r\nwhich, I have no doubt, the intense heat of a New York summer renders\r\nvery advisable, if not absolutely necessary--viz., the canine\r\n_auto-da-fé_, which takes place in July. The heart sickens at the\r\nthought of the wholesale murder of \"man's most faithful companion,\" and\r\nthe feeling increases when you read that sometimes more than a thousand\r\ndogs fall victims to the law in one season; but that very fact is the\r\nstrongest point which can be urged in its justifications for the dry hot\r\natmosphere of the summer affords a ready stepping-stone to hydrophobia,\r\nand the larger the canine family, the greater the danger of that fearful\r\nand incurable disease.\r\n\r\nUpon a certain day, the mayor of New York offers the usual reward of\r\n2s. for every dog, which, having been found unmuzzled in the streets,\r\nis brought to the canine pound. However judicious this municipal\r\nregulation may be, it cannot fail to strike the reader as offering one\r\nmost objectionable feature, in the golden harvest which it enables those\r\nastute rogues, the dog-stealers, to reap. Any one conversant with the\r\nirresistible nostrums possessed by those rascals, can readily understand\r\nwhat an extensive field is hereby opened up to them; and, if one can\r\nform a just opinion by comparing the number of dogs one habitually meets\r\nin the streets with the multitude that are reputed to fall victims under\r\nthe official mandate, they certainly make the most of their opportunity.\r\n\r\nTo any admirer of the race, the inside of the pound must be a most\r\npainful and revolting spectacle: there may be seen, lying side by side,\r\n\"dignity and impudence,\" the fearless bull and the timid spaniel, the\r\nbloated pug and the friendly Newfoundland, the woolly lap-dog and the\r\nwhining cur; some growling in defiance, some whimpering in misery, some\r\nlooking imploringly--their intelligent eyes challenging present sympathy\r\non the ground of past fidelity--all, all in vain: the hour that summons\r\nthe Mussulman to prayer, equally silently tolls their death-knell; yon\r\nglorious sun, setting in a flood of fire, lights them to their untimely\r\ngrave; one ruthless hand holds the unconscious head, another with deadly\r\naim smashes the skull and scatters the brain--man's faithful friend is a\r\ncorpse.\r\n\r\nOwners are allowed to reclaim their property before sunset, on payment\r\nof the 2s. reward; the best-looking dogs are sometimes kept for two or\r\nthree days, as purchasers are frequently found. The price, after the\r\nfirst day, is, the killer's fee and the food given, in addition to the\r\noriginal reward; altogether, it rarely exceeds 8s. The owner has to\r\npurchase like any other person. The bodies are all taken away to be\r\nboiled down for their fat, and the skins go to the tanners. Let us now\r\nturn from this disgusting subject to something more agreeable.\r\n\r\nI have already alluded to the great fancy Americans have for trotters.\r\nThe best place to see \"turns out\" is the Bloomingdale road, which runs\r\nout of New York, nearly parallel with the Hudson, and separated from it\r\nonly by the country villas, &c., built on the banks of that noble\r\nstream. This drive may be called a purely democratic \"Rotten-row,\" as\r\nregards its being the favourite resort; but there the similarity ceases.\r\nTo the one, people go to lounge, meet friends, and breathe fresh air on\r\nhorseback; to the other, people go with a fixed determination to pass\r\neverybody, and on wheels. To the one, people go before dinner; to the\r\nother, after.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine having offered me a feed, and a seat behind a pair of\r\nthree-minuters, the offer was too good to be refused. The operation of\r\ngetting into one of these four-wheel waggons, looks perplexing enough,\r\nas the only rest for the feet, which appears, is the cap of the axle;\r\nbut, upon pulling the horses' heads into the middle of the street, and\r\nthus locking the fore-wheels, a stop is discovered, which renders the\r\nprocess easy. It is difficult to say which is the more remarkable, the\r\nlightness of the waggon, or the lightness of the harness; either is\r\nsufficient to give a nervous feeling of insufficiency to a stranger who\r\ntrusts himself to them for the first time; but experience proves both\r\ntheir sufficiency and their advantage. In due time, we reached the outer\r\nlimits of the town; struggling competitors soon appeared, and, in spite\r\nof dust as plentiful as a plague of locusts, every challenge was\r\naccepted; a fair pass once made, the victor was satisfied, and resumed a\r\nmore moderate pace. We had already given one or two the go-by, when we\r\nheard a clattering of hoofs close behind us, and the well-known cry,\r\n\"G'lang.\" My friend let out his three-minuters, but ere they reached\r\ntheir speed, the foe was well on our bow, and there he kept, bidding us\r\ndefiance. It is, doubtless, very exciting to drive at the rate of twenty\r\nmiles an hour, and though the horses' hoofs throw more gravel down your\r\nthroat in five minutes than would suffice a poultry-yard for a week, one\r\ndoes not think of it at the time.\r\n\r\nOn we flew; our foe on two wheels and single harness every now and then\r\nletting us get abreast of him, and then shooting ahead like an arrow\r\nfrom a bow. A few trials showed us the struggle was useless: we had to\r\ndeal with a regular \"pacer,\" and--as I have elsewhere remarked--their\r\nspeed is greater than that of any fair trotter, although so fatiguing\r\nthat they are unable to keep it up for any great distance; but as we had\r\nalready turned the bottom of the car into a gravel-pit, we did not think\r\nit worth while to continue the amusement. The reason may be asked why\r\nthese waggons have such low splashboards as to admit all the gravel? The\r\nreason is simple. Go-ahead is the great desideratum, and they are kept\r\nlow to enable you to watch the horses' hind legs; by doing which, a\r\nknowing Jehu can discover when they are about to break into a gallop,\r\nand can handle \"the ribands\" accordingly.\r\n\r\nA tremendous storm brewing to windward, cut short our intended drive;\r\nand, putting the nags to their best pace, we barely succeeded in\r\nobtaining shelter ere it burst upon us; and such a pelter as it came\r\ndown, who ever saw? It seemed as though the countless hosts of heaven\r\nhad been mustered with barrels, not buckets, of water, and as they upset\r\nthem on the poor devoted earth, a regular hurricane came to the rescue,\r\nand swept them eastward to the ocean. The sky, from time to time, was\r\none blaze of sheet lightning, and during the intervals, forked flashes\r\nshot through the darkness like fiery serpents striking their prey. This\r\nstorm, if short, was at all events magnificently grand, and we\r\nsubsequently found it had been terribly destructive also; boats on the\r\nHudson had been capsized and driven ashore, houses had been unroofed,\r\nand forest trees split like penny canes.\r\n\r\nThe inn where we had taken shelter was fortunately not touched, nor were\r\nany of the trees which surrounded it. Beautifully situated on a high\r\nbank, sloping down to the Hudson, full of fine old timber; it had\r\nbelonged to some English noble--I forget his name--in the old colonial\r\ntimes; now, it was a favourite baiting-place for the frequenters of the\r\nBloomingdale road, and dispensed the most undeniably good republican\r\ndrinks, cobblers, cock-tails, slings, and hail-storms, with other more\r\nsubstantial and excellent things to match. The storm being over, we\r\nunhitched the horses, and returned to town at a more sober pace; nor\r\nwere we much troubled with dust during the drive home.\r\n\r\nLest the reader should get wearied with so long a stay at New York, I\r\nnow propose to shift the scene for his amusement, and hope he will\r\naccompany me in my wanderings. If, during the operation, he occasionally\r\nfinds me tedious in any details uninteresting to him, I trust that a\r\njudicious skipping of a few leaves will bring us again into agreeable\r\ncompanionship.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote F: The largest boom in the Navy is 72 feet long, and 16-1/2\r\ninches in diameter; the largest mast is 127 feet 3 inches long, and 42\r\ninches diameter; the largest yard is 111 feet long, and 26-1/2 inches\r\ndiameter.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote G: Turbot is a good substitute for sea-bass.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote H: A small American biscuit made of best flour.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote I: _Vide_ sketch of Aqueduct.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n_South and West_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing anxious to visit the southern parts of this Empire State, and\r\nhaving found an agreeable companion, we fixed upon an early day in\r\nNovember for our start; and although I anticipated much pleasure from\r\nthe scenery and places of interest which my proposed trip would carry me\r\nthrough, I could not blind myself to the sad fact, that the gorgeous\r\nmantle of autumn had fallen from the forest, and left in its stead the\r\ndreary nakedness of winter. The time I could allot to the journey was\r\nunfortunately so short, that, except of one or two of the leading\r\nplaces, I could not hope to have more than literally a flying sight, and\r\nshould therefore be insensibly compelled to receive many impressions\r\nfrom the travelling society among which the Fates threw me.\r\n\r\nEight o'clock in the morning found us both at the Jersey ferry, where\r\nour tickets for Baltimore--both for man and luggage--were to be\r\nobtained. It was a pelting snow-storm, and the luggage-ticketing had to\r\nbe performed _al fresco_, which, combined with the total want of order\r\nso prevalent in the railway establishments in this country, made it\r\nanything but an agreeable operation. Our individual tickets were\r\nobtained under shelter, but in an office of such Lilliputian dimensions,\r\nthat the ordinary press of passengers made it like a theatrical squeeze\r\non a Jenny Lind night; only with this lamentable difference--that the\r\ntheatrical squeeze was a prelude to all that could charm the senses,\r\nwhereas the ticket squeeze was, I knew but too well, the precursor of a\r\nday of most uncomfortable travelling.\r\n\r\nHaving our tickets, we crossed the ever-glorious Hudson, and, landing at\r\nJersey City, had the pleasure of \"puddling it up\" through the snow to\r\nthe railway carriages. There they were, with the red-hot stove and\r\npoisonous atmosphere, as usual; so my friend and I, selecting a\r\ncushionless \"smoking-car,\" where the windows would at all events be\r\nopen, seated ourselves on the hard boards of resignation, lit the tapery\r\nweed of consolation, and shrouded ourselves in its fragrant clouds. On\r\nwe went, hissing through the snow-storm, till the waters of the Delaware\r\nbrought us to a stand-still; then, changing to a steamer, we crossed the\r\nbroad stream, on which to save time, they served dinner, and almost\r\nbefore it was ended we had reached Philadelphia, where 'busses were in\r\nwaiting to take us to the railway. I may as well mention here, that one\r\nof the various ways in which the glorious liberty of the country shows\r\nitself, is the deliberate manner in which 'busses and stages stop in the\r\nmiddle of the muddiest roads, in the worst weather, so that you may get\r\nthoroughly well muddied and soaked in effecting your entry. Equality, I\r\nsuppose, requires that if the coachman is to be wet and uncomfortable,\r\nthe passengers should be brought as near as possible to the same state.\r\n\r\nThe 'busses being all ready, off we started, and just reached the train\r\nin time; for, being a mail-train, it could not wait, though we had paid\r\nour fares all through to Baltimore. Soon after our departure, I heard\r\ntwo neighbours conversing between the intervals of the clouds of\r\nVirginia which they puffed assiduously. Says one, \"I guess all the\r\nbaggage is left behind.\" The friend, after a long draw at his weed,\r\nthrew out a cloud sufficient to cover the rock of Gibraltar, and\r\nreplied, with the most philosophical composure, \"I guess it aint\r\nnurthin' else.\" My friend and I puffed vigorously, and looked\r\ninquiringly at each other, as much as to say, \"Can our luggage be left\r\nbehind?\" Soon the conductor appeared to _viser_ the tickets: he would\r\nsolve our doubts.--\"I say, conductor, is our luggage which came from New\r\nYork, left behind?\" \"Ay, I guess it is, every stick of it; and if you\r\nhad been ten minutes later, I guess you might have stayed with it; it'll\r\ncome on to-night, and be at Baltimore to-morrow morning about half-past\r\nfour; if you'll give me your tickets, and tell me what hotel you are\r\ngoing to, I'll have it sent up.\" Upon inquiry, we found this was a very\r\ncommon event, nor did anybody seem to think it a subject worth taking\r\npains to have rectified, though the smallest amount of common sense and\r\ncommon arrangement might easily obviate it. And why this indifference?\r\nBecause, first it would cost a few cents; secondly, it doesn't affect\r\nthe majority, who travel with a small hand-bag only; thirdly, the\r\nrailway across New Jersey is a monopoly, and therefore people must take\r\nthat road or none; and lastly, from the observations I elicited in the\r\ncourse of examining my witnesses, it appeared to me that the jealousy\r\nand rivalry existing between New Jersey, New York, and Philadelphia,\r\nhave some little effect; at all events, it is an ignoble affair that it\r\nis suffered to remain. I have, however, no doubt that time will remedy\r\nthis, as I trust it will many of the other inconveniences and wants of\r\narrangement which the whole railway system in this country is at present\r\nsubject to.--To return from my digression.\r\n\r\nOn we went, and soon crossed the Campbell-immortalized Susquehana.\r\nWhatever beauties there were, the elements effectually concealed; and\r\nafter a day's journey, which, for aught we saw, might as well have been\r\nover the Shrap Falls, half-past six P.M. landed us in Baltimore, where\r\nwe safely received our luggage the following morning.\r\n\r\nA letter of introduction to a friend soon surrounded us with kindness in\r\nthis hospitable city. My object in stopping here was merely to enjoy a\r\nlittle of the far-famed canvas-back duck shooting and eating, as I\r\npurposed revisiting these parts early in spring, when I should have more\r\nleisure. No sooner were our wishes known than one of our kind friends\r\nimmediately offered to drive us down to Maxwell Point, which is part of\r\na large property belonging to General Cadwallader, and is situated in\r\none of the endless inlets with which Chesapeake Bay abounds. All being\r\narranged, our friend appeared in a light waggon, with a pair of spicy\r\ntrotters before it. The road out was dreary and uninteresting enough;\r\nbut when we left it, and turned into a waggon way through an extensive\r\nforest, I could not but feel what a lovely ride or drive it must be in\r\nthe more genial seasons of the year, when the freshness of spring and\r\nsummer, or the richness of autumn, clothes the dense wood with its\r\nbeauties. A short and pleasant drive brought us to a ferry, by which we\r\ncrossed over to the famous Point, thereby avoiding the long round which\r\nwe otherwise must have made. The waters were alive with duck in every\r\ndirection; it reminded me forcibly of the Lake Menzaleh, near Damietta,\r\nthe only place where I had ever before seen such a duckery.\r\n\r\nThe sporting ground is part of a property belonging to General\r\nCadwallader, and is leased to a club of gentlemen; they have built a\r\nvery snug little shooting-box, where they leave their guns and\r\n_matériel_ for sport, running down occasionally from Baltimore for a day\r\nor two, when opportunity offers, and enjoying themselves in true pic-nic\r\nstyle.[J] The real time for good sport is from the middle of October to\r\nthe middle of November, and what produces the sport is, the ducks\r\nshifting their feeding-ground, in performing which operation they cross\r\nover this long point. As the season gets later, the birds do not shift\r\ntheir ground so frequently; and, moreover, getting scared by the eternal\r\ncannonade which is kept up, they fly very high when they do cross. The\r\nbest times are daybreak and just before dark; but even then, if the\r\nweather is not favourable, they pass but scantily. My friend warned me\r\nof this, as the season for good sport was already passed, though only\r\nthe nineteenth of November, and he did not wish me to be disappointed.\r\nWe landed on the Point about half-past four P.M., and immediately\r\nprepared for mischief, though those who had been there during the day\r\ngave us little encouragement.\r\n\r\nThe _modus operandi_ is very simply told. You dress yourself in the most\r\ninvisible colours, and, armed with a huge duck-gun--double or single, as\r\nyou like--you proceed to your post, which is termed here a \"blind.\" It\r\nis a kind of box, about four feet high, with three sides and no top; a\r\nbench is fixed inside, on which to sit and place your loading gear.\r\nThese blinds are fixed in the centre line of the long point, and about\r\nfifty yards apart. One side of the point they call \"Bay,\" and the other\r\n\"River.\" The sportsmen look out carefully from side to side, and the\r\nmoment any ducks are seen in motion, the cry is given \"bay\" or \"river,\"\r\naccording to the side from which they are approaching. Each sportsman,\r\nthe moment he \"views the ducks,\" crouches down in his blind as much out\r\nof sight as possible, waiting till they are nearly overhead, then,\r\nrising with his murderous weapon, lets drive at them the moment they\r\nhave passed. As they usually fly very high, their thick downy coating\r\nwould turn any shots directed against them, on their approach. In this\r\nway, during a favourable day in the early part of the season, a mixed\r\n\"file and platoon\" firing of glorious _coups de roi_ is kept up\r\nincessantly. We were very unfortunate that evening, as but few ducks\r\nwere in motion, and those few passed at so great a height, that,\r\nalthough the large A.A. rattled against them from a ponderous Purdey\r\nwhich a friend had lent me, they declined coming down. I had only\r\nsucceeded in getting one during my two hours' watching, when darkness\r\nforced me to beat a retreat.\r\n\r\nBut who shall presume to attempt a description of the luscious birds as\r\nthey come in by pairs, \"hot and hot?\" A dozen of the members of the club\r\nare assembled; a hearty and hospitable welcome greets the stranger--a\r\nwelcome so warm that he cannot feel he is a stranger; every face is\r\nradiant with health, every lip moist with appetite; an unmistakeable\r\nfragrance reaches the nostrils--no further summons to the festive scene\r\nis needed. The first and minor act of soup being over, the \"smoking\r\npair\" come in, and are placed before the president. In goes the\r\nfork;--gracious! how the juice spouts out. The dry dish swims; one\r\nskilful dash with the knife on each side, the victim is severed in three\r\nparts, streaming with richness, and whetting the appetite to absolute\r\ngreediness. But there is an old adage which says, \"All is not gold that\r\nglitters.\" Can this be a deception? The first piece you put in your\r\nmouth, as it melts away on the palate, dissipates the thought, and you\r\nunhesitatingly pronounce it the most delicious morsel you ever tasted.\r\nIn they come, hot and hot; and, like Oliver, you ask for more, but with\r\nbetter success. Your host, when he sees you flagging, urges, \"one\" more\r\ncut. You hesitate, thinking a couple of ducks a very fair allowance. He\r\nreplies,--\"'Pon my word, it's such light food; you can eat a dozen!\" A\r\njovial son of Aesculapius, on whom Father Time had set his mark, though\r\nhe has left his conviviality in all the freshness of youth, is appealed\r\nto. He declares, positively, that he knows nothing so easy of digestion\r\nas a canvas-back duck; and he eats away jollily up to his assertion. How\r\nvery catching it is!--each fresh arrival from the kitchen brings a fresh\r\nappetite to the party. \"One down, t'other come on,\" is the order of the\r\nday. Those who read, may say \"Gormandizer!\" But many such, believe me,\r\nif placed behind three, or even four, of these luscious birds, cooked\r\nwith the artistic accuracy of the Maxwell Point _cuisine_, would leave\r\na cat but sorry pickings, especially when the bottle passes freely, and\r\njovial friends cheer you on. Of course, I do not allude to such people\r\nas enjoy that \"soaked oakum,\" called \"bouilli.\" To offer a well-cooked\r\ncanvas-back duck to them, would, indeed, be casting pearls\r\nbefore--something. Neither would it suit the fastidious taste of those\r\nwho, not being able to discern the difference between juice and blood,\r\ncook all flavour and nourishment out of their meats, and luxuriate on\r\nthe chippy substance which is left.--But time rolls on; cigars and toddy\r\nhave followed; and, as we must be at our posts ere dawn, to Bedfordshire\r\nwe go.\r\n\r\nEre the day had dawned, a hasty cup of coffee prepared us for the\r\nmorning's sport; and, lighting the friendly weed, we groped our way to\r\nour respective blinds, full of hope and thirsting for blood. Alas! the\r\nFates were not propitious; but few birds crossed, and those mostly out\r\nof range. However, I managed to bag half a dozen before I was summoned\r\nto nine o'clock breakfast, a meal at which, it is needless to say, the\r\n\"glorious bird\" was plentifully distributed. After breakfast, I amused\r\nmyself with a telescope, watching the ducks diving and fighting for the\r\nwild celery which covers the bottom of these creeks and bays, and which\r\nis generally supposed to give the birds their rich and peculiar flavour.\r\nThey know the powers of a duck-gun to a T; and, keeping beyond its\r\nrange, they come as close as possible to feed, the water being, of\r\ncourse, shallower, and the celery more easily obtained. Our time being\r\nlimited, we were reluctantly constrained to bid adieu to our kind and\r\nhospitable entertainers, of whose friendly welcome and good cheer I\r\nretain the most lively recollections.\r\n\r\nCrossing the bay in a small boat, we re-entered the light carriage, and\r\nwere soon \"tooling away\" merrily to Baltimore. On the road, our friend\r\namused us with accounts of two different methods adopted in these waters\r\nfor getting ducks for the pot. One method is, to find a bay where the\r\nducks are plentiful, and tolerably near the shore; and then, concealing\r\nyourself as near the water's edge as possible, you take a stick, on the\r\nend of which you tie a handkerchief, and keep waving it steadily\r\nbackwards and forwards. The other method is to employ a dog in lieu of\r\nthe stick and handkerchief. They have a regular breed for the purpose,\r\nabout the size of a large Skye terrier, and of a sandy colour. You keep\r\nthrowing pebbles to the water's edge, which the dog follows; and thus he\r\nis ever running to and fro. In either case, the ducks, having something\r\nof the woman in their composition, gradually swim in, to ascertain the\r\nmeaning or cause of these mysterious movements; and, once arrived within\r\nrange, the sportsman rises suddenly, and, as the scared birds get on the\r\nwing, they receive the penalty of their curiosity in a murderous\r\ndischarge. These two methods they call \"tolling;\" and most effectual\r\nthey prove for supplying the market.\r\n\r\nDifferent nations exhibit different methods of ingenuity for the capture\r\nof game, &c. I remember being struck, when in Egypt, with the artful\r\nplan employed for catching ducks and flamingos, on Lake Menzaleh; which\r\nis, for the huntsman to put a gourd on his head, pierced sufficiently to\r\nsee through, and by means of which,--the rest of his body being\r\nthoroughly immersed in water,--he approaches his game so easily, that\r\nthe first notice they have thereof is the unpleasant sensation they\r\nexperience as his hand closes upon their legs in the depths of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nOf the town, &c., of Baltimore, I hope to tell you something more on my\r\nreturn. We will therefore proceed at once to the railway station, and\r\ntake our places for Pittsburg. It is a drizzly, snowy morning, a kind of\r\nmoisture that laughs at so-called waterproofs, and would penetrate an\r\nair-pump. As there was no smoking-car, we were constrained to enter\r\nanother; and off we started. At first, the atmosphere was bearable; but\r\nsoon, alas! too soon, every window was closed; the stove glowed red-hot;\r\nthe tough-hided natives gathered round it, and, deluging it with\r\nexpectorated showers of real Virginian juice, the hissing and stench\r\nbecame insufferable. I had no resource but to open my window, and let\r\nthe driving sleet drench one side of me, while the other was baking;\r\nthus, one cheek was in an ice-house, and the other in an oven. At noon\r\nwe came to \"a fix;\" the railway bridge across to Harrisburg had broken\r\ndown. There was nothing for it but patience; and, in due time, it was\r\nrewarded by the arrival of three omnibuses and a luggage-van. As there\r\nwere about eighty people in the train, it became a difficult task to\r\nknow how to pack, for the same wretched weather continued, and nobody\r\ncourted an outside place, with drenched clothes wherein to continue the\r\njourney. At last, however, it was managed, something on the\r\nherrings-in-a-barrel principle. I had one lady in my lap, and a darling\r\nunwashed pledge of her affection on each foot. We counted twenty-six\r\nheads, in all; and we jolted away, as fast as the snow would let us, to\r\ncatch the Philadelphia train, which was to pick us up here.\r\n\r\nWe managed to arrive about an hour and a half after it had passed; and,\r\ntherefore, no alternative remained but to adjourn to the little inn, and\r\nfortify ourselves for the trial with such good things as mine host of\r\nthe \"Culverley\" could produce. It had now settled down to a regular fall\r\nof snow, and we began to feel anxious about the chances of proceeding.\r\n\r\nHarrisburg may be very pretty and interesting in fine weather, but it\r\nwas a desolately dreary place to anticipate being snowed-up at in\r\nwinter, although situated on the banks of the lovely Susquehana:\r\naccordingly, I asked mine host when the next train would pass. He\r\nreplied, with grammatical accuracy, \"It should pass about four to-morrow\r\nmorning; but when it will I am puzzled to say.--What's your opinion,\r\nColonel?\" he added; and, turning round, I observed the distinguished\r\nmilitary authority seated on one chair, and his legs gracefully pendent\r\nover the back of another. In his sword-hand, he wielded a small\r\nclasp-knife, which did the alternate duty of a toothpick and a\r\nwhittler,[K] for which latter amusement he kept a small stick in his\r\nleft hand to operate upon; and the floor bore testimony to his untiring\r\nzeal. When the important question was propounded to him, he ceased from\r\nhis whittling labours, and, burying the blade deep between his ivories,\r\nlooked out of the window with an authoritative air, apparently\r\nendeavouring, first, to ascertain what depth of snow was on the ground,\r\nand then, by an upward glance, to calculate how much more was likely to\r\nfollow. Having duly weighed these points, and having perfected the\r\nchannel between his ivories, he sucked the friendly blade, and replied,\r\nwith a stoical indifference--which, considering my anxiety, might almost\r\nbe styled heartless--\"I guess, if it goes on snowing like this, you'll\r\nhave no cars here to-morrow at all.\" Then, craning up to the heavens, as\r\nif seeking for the confirmation of a more terrible prophecy, he added,\r\n\"By the looks of it, I think the gem'men may be fixed here for a week.\"\r\nHaving delivered himself of the foregoing consolatory observation, and\r\nduly discharged a shower of Virginia juice on the floor, the military\r\nauthority resumed his whittling labours with increased vigour. His\r\noccupation involuntarily carried my mind across the water to a\r\ncountry-house, where I had so often seen an old blind friend amusing\r\nhimself, by tearing up paper into small pieces, to make pillows for the\r\npoor. If the gallant Colonel would only substitute this occupation for\r\nwhittling, what good might he not do in Harrisburg!\r\n\r\nI am happy to say that my Job's comforter turned out a false prophet;\r\nsnow soon gave place to sleet, and sleet to rain, and before midnight\r\nthe muck was complete. Next morning, at three, we got into the 'bus, and\r\nsoon after four the cars came in, and we found ourselves once more _en\r\nroute_ for Pittsburg. I think this was about the most disagreeable day's\r\njourney I ever had. The mixture of human and metallic heat, the chorus\r\nof infantine squallers--who kept responding to one another from all\r\nparts of the car, like so many dogs in an eastern city--and the\r\nintervals filled up by the hissing on the stove of the Virginia juice,\r\nwere unpleasant enough; but even the elements combined against us. The\r\nrain and the snow were fighting together, and producing that slushiness\r\nof atmosphere which obscures all scenery; added to which, the\r\nunfortunate foreknowledge that we were doomed to fifteen or sixteen\r\nhours of these combinations of misery, made it indeed a wretched day. My\r\nonly resource was to open a window, which the moment I attempted, a\r\nhulking fellow, swaddled up in coats and comforters, and bursting with\r\nhealth, begged it might be closed as \"It was so cold:\" the thermometer,\r\nI am sure, was ranging, within the car, from ninety to a hundred\r\ndegrees. He then tried to hector and bully, and finding that of no use,\r\nhe appealed to the guard. I claimed my right, and further pleaded the\r\nnecessity of fresh air, not merely for comfort, but for very life. As my\r\nfriend expressed the same sentiments, the cantankerous Hector was left\r\nto sulk; and I must own to a malicious satisfaction, when, soon after,\r\ntwo ladies came in, and seating themselves on the bench abreast of mine,\r\nopened their window, and placed Hector in a thorough draught, which,\r\nwhile gall and wormwood to him, was balm of Gilead to me. As I freely\r\ncriticise American habits, &c., during my travels, it is but just I\r\nshould state, that Hector was the only one of his countrymen I ever met\r\nwho was wilfully offensive and seemed to wish to insult.\r\n\r\nThe engineering on this road was so contrived, that we had to go through\r\nan operation, which to me was quite novel--viz., being dragged by wire\r\nropes up one of the Alleghany hills, and eased down the other side. The\r\nextreme height is sixteen hundred feet; and it is accomplished by five\r\ndifferent stationary engines, each placed on a separate inclined plane,\r\nthe highest of which is two thousand six hundred feet above the level of\r\nthe sea. The want of proper arrangement and sufficient hands made this a\r\nmost dilatory and tedious operation. Upon asking why so 'cute and\r\ngo-ahead a people had tolerated such bad engineering originally, and\r\nsuch dilatory arrangements up to the present hour, I was answered, \"Oh,\r\nsir, that's easily explained; it is a government road and a monopoly,\r\nbut another road is nearly completed, by which all this will be avoided;\r\nand, as it is in the hands of a company, there will be no delay\r\nthen.\"--How curious it is, the way governments mess such things when\r\nthey undertake them! I could not help thinking of the difference between\r\nour own government mails from Marseilles to Malta, &c., and the glorious\r\nsteamers of the Peninsular and Oriental Company, that carry on the same\r\nmails from Malta.--But to return from my digression.\r\n\r\nI was astonished to see a thing like a piece of a canal-boat descending\r\none of these inclined planes on a truck; nor was my astonishment\r\ndiminished when I found that it really was part of a canal-boat, and\r\nthat the remaining portions were following in the rear. The boats are\r\nmade, some in three, some in five compartments; and, being merely\r\nforelocked together, are easily carried across the hill, from the canal\r\non one side to the continuation thereof on the other.[L]\r\n\r\n\r\nA few hours after quitting these planes, we came to the end of the\r\nrailway, and had to coach it over a ten-mile break in the line. It was\r\none of those wretched wet days which is said to make even an old\r\ninhabitant of Argyleshire look despondingly,--in which county, it will\r\nbe remembered that, after six weeks' incessant wet, an English\r\ntraveller, on asking a shepherd boy whether it always rained there,\r\nreceived the consoling reply of, \"No, sir--it sometimes snaws.\" The\r\nground was from eight to eighteen inches deep in filthy mud; the old\r\nnine-inside stages--of which more anon--were waiting ready; and as there\r\nwere several ladies in the cars, I thought the stages might be induced\r\nto draw up close to the scantily-covered platform to take up the\r\npassengers; but no such idea entered their heads. I imagine such an\r\nindication of civilization would have been at variance with their\r\nrepublican notions of liberty; and the fair ones had no alternative but\r\nto pull their garments up to the altitude of those of a ballet-dancer,\r\nand to bury their neat feet and well-turned ankles deep, deep, deep in\r\nthe filthy mire. But what made this conduct irresistibly\r\nludicrous--though painful to any gentleman to witness--was the mockery\r\nof make-believe gallantry exhibited, in seating all the ladies before\r\nany gentleman was allowed to enter; the upshot of which was, that they\r\ngradually created a comparatively beaten path for the gentlemen to get\r\nin by. One pull of the rein and one grain of manners would have enabled\r\neverybody to enter clean and dry; yet so habituated do the better\r\nclasses appear to have become to this phase of democracy, that no one\r\nremonstrated on behalf of the ladies or himself.\r\n\r\nThe packing completed, a jolting ride brought us again to the railway\r\ncars; and in a few hours more--amid the cries of famishing babes and\r\nsleepy children, the \"hush-hushes\" of affectionate mammas, the bustle of\r\ngathering packages, and the expiring heat of the poisonous stove--we\r\nreached the young Birmingham of America about 10 P.M., and soon found\r\nrest in a comfortable bed, at a comfortable hotel.\r\n\r\nIf you wish a good idea of Pittsburg, you should go to Birmingham, and\r\nreduce its size, in your imagination, to one-fourth the reality; after\r\nwhich, let the streets of this creation of your fancy be \"top-dressed\"\r\nabout a foot deep with equal proportions of clay and coal-dust; then try\r\nto realize in your mind the effect which a week's violent struggle\r\nbetween Messrs. Snow and Sleet would produce, and you will thus be\r\nenabled to enjoy some idea of the charming scene which Pittsburg\r\npresented on the day of my visit. But if this young Birmingham has so\r\nmuch in common with the elder, there is one grand feature it possesses\r\nwhich the other wants. The Ohio and Monongahela rivers form the delta on\r\nwhich it is built, and on the bosom of the former the fruits of its\r\nlabour are borne down to New Orleans, _viâ_ the Mississippi--a distance\r\nof two thousand and twenty-five miles exactly. Coal and iron abound in\r\nthe neighbourhood; they are as handy, in reality, as the Egyptian geese\r\nare in the legend, where they are stated to fly about ready roasted,\r\ncrying, \"Come and eat me!\" Perhaps, then, you will ask, why is the town\r\nnot larger, and the business not more active? The answer is simple. The\r\nprice of labour is so high, that they cannot compote with the parent\r\nrival; and the _ad valorem_ duty on iron, though it may bring in a\r\nrevenue to the government, is no protection to the home trade. What\r\nchanges emigration from the Old World may eventually produce, time alone\r\ncan decide; but it requires no prophetic vision to foresee that the\r\nundeveloped mineral riches of this continent must some day be worked\r\nwith telling effect upon England's trade. I must not deceive you into a\r\nbelief that the Ohio is always navigable. So far from that being the\r\ncase, I understand that, for weeks and months even, it is constantly\r\nfordable. As late as the 23rd of November, the large passage-boats were\r\nunable to make regular passages, owing to their so frequently getting\r\naground; and the consequence was, that we were doomed to prosecute our\r\njourney to Cincinnati by railroad, to my infinite--but, as my friend\r\nsaid, not inexpressible--regret.\r\n\r\nNoon found us at the station, taking the last bite of fresh air before\r\nwe entered the travelling oven. Fortunately, the weather was rather\r\nfiner than it had been, and more windows were open. There is something\r\nsolemn and grand in traversing, with the speed of the wind, miles and\r\nmiles of the desolate forest. Sometimes you pass a whole hour without\r\nany--the slightest--sign of animal life: not a bird, nor a beast, nor a\r\nbeing. The hissing train rattles along; the trumpet-tongued whistle--or\r\nrather horn--booms far away in the breeze, and finds no echo; the giant\r\nmonarchs of the forest line the road on either side, like a guard of\r\nTitans, their nodding heads inquiring, as it were curiously, why their\r\nranks were thinned, and what strange meteor is that which, with clatter\r\nand roar, rushes past, disturbing their peaceful solitude. Patience my\r\nnoble friends; patience, I say. A few short years more, and many of you,\r\nlike your deceased brethren, will bend your proud heads level with the\r\ndust, and those giant limbs, which now kiss the summer sun and dare the\r\nwinter's blast, will feed that insatiate meteor's stomach, or crackle\r\nbeneath some adventurous pioneer's soup-kettle. But, never mind; like\r\ngood soldiers in a good cause, you will sacrifice yourselves for the\r\npublic good; and possibly some of you may be carved into figures of\r\nhonour, and dance triumphantly on the surge's crest in the advance post\r\nof glory on a dashing clipper's bows, girt with a band on which is\r\ninscribed, in letters of gold, the imperishable name of Washington or\r\nFranklin.\r\n\r\nBeing of a generous disposition, I have thrown out these hints in the\r\nhopes some needy American author may make his fortune, and immortalize\r\nhis country, by writing \"The Life and Adventures of the Forest Monarch;\"\r\nor, as the public like mystery, he might make a good hit by entitling it\r\n\"The Child of the Woods that danced on the Wave.\" Swift has immortalized\r\na tub; other authors have endeavoured to immortalize a shilling, and a\r\nhalfpenny. Let that great country which professes to be able to \"whip\r\ncreation\" take a noble subject worthy of such high pretensions.\r\n\r\nHere we are at Cleveland; and, \"by the powers of Mercury\"--this\r\nexpletive originated, I believe, with a proud barometer,--it is raining\r\ncats and dogs and a host of inferior animals. Everybody seems very\r\nimpatient, for all are getting out, and yet we have not reached the\r\nstation,--no; and they don't mean to get there at present. Possession is\r\nnine points of the law, and another train is ensconced there. Wood, of\r\ncourse, is so dear in this country, and railroads give such low\r\ninterest--varying from six to forty per cent.--that they can't afford to\r\nhave sufficient shedding. Well, out we get. Touters from the hotels cry\r\nout lustily. We hear the name of the house to which we are bound, and\r\nprepare to follow. The touter carries a lantern of that ingenious size\r\nwhich helps to make the darkness more visible; two steps, and you are\r\nover the ankles in mud. \"Show a light, boy.\" He turns round, and,\r\nplacing his lantern close to the ground, you see at a glance the horrid\r\ntruth revealed--you are in a perfect mud swamp; so, tuck up your\r\ntrowsers, and wade away to the omnibuses, about a quarter of a mile off.\r\nGracious me! there are two ladies, with their dresses hitched up like\r\nkilts, sliding and floundering through the slushy road. How miserable\r\nthey must be, poor things! Not the least; they are both tittering and\r\ngiggling merrily; they are accustomed to it, and habit is second nature.\r\nA man from the Old World of advanced civilization--in these matters of\r\nminor comforts, at least--will soon learn to conduct himself upon the\r\nprinciple, that where ignorance is bliss, wisdom becomes folly.\r\nLaughing, like love, is catching; so these two jolly ladies put me in a\r\ngood humour, and I laughed my way to the 'bus half up to my knees in\r\nmud. After all, it made it lighter work than growling, and go I must; so\r\nthank you, ladies, for the cheering example.\r\n\r\nHot tea soon washes away from a thirsty and wearied soul the remembrance\r\nof muddy boots, and a good Havana soothes the wounded spirit. After\r\nenjoying both, I retired to rest, as I hoped, for we had to make an\r\nearly start in the morning. Scarce was I in bed, ere the house rang\r\nagain with laughing and romping just outside my door; black and white,\r\nold and young, male and female, all seemed chorusing together--feet\r\nclattered, passages echoed--it was a very Babel of noise and confusion.\r\nWhat strange beings we are! Not two hours before, I had said and felt\r\nthat laughing was catching; now, although the merry chirp of youth\r\nmingled with it, I wished the whole party at the residence of an old\r\ngentleman whose name I care not to mention. May we not truly say of\r\nourselves what the housemaid says of the missing article--\"Really, sir,\r\nI don't know nothing at all about it?\" A few hours before, I was\r\njoining in the laugh as I waded nearly knee-deep in mud, and now I was\r\nlying in a comfortable bed grinding my teeth at the same joyous sounds.\r\n\r\nIt took three messages to the proprietor, before order was restored and\r\nI was asleep. In the morning, I found that the cause of all the rumpus\r\nwas a marriage that had taken place in the hotel; and the master and\r\nmistress being happy, the servants caught the joyous infection, and got\r\nthe children to share it with them. I must not be understood to cast any\r\nreflections upon the happy pair, when I say that the marriage took place\r\nin the morning, and that the children were laughing at night, for\r\nremember, I never inquired into the parentage of the little ducks. On\r\nlearning the truth, I was rejoiced to feel that they had not gone to the\r\nresidence of the old gentleman before alluded to, and I made resolutions\r\nto restrain my temper in future. After a night's rest, with a cup of hot\r\n_café au lait_ before you, how easy and pleasant good resolutions are.\r\n\r\nHaving finished a hasty breakfast, we tumbled into an omnibus, packed\r\nlike herrings in a barrel, for our number was \"Legion,\" and the omnibus\r\nwas \"Zoar.\" Off we went to the railway; such a mass of mud I never saw.\r\nIs it from this peculiarity that the city takes its name? This, however,\r\ndoes not prevent it from being a very thriving place, and destined, I\r\nbelieve, to be a town of considerable importance, as soon as the grain\r\nand mineral wealth of Michigan, Wisconsin, &c., get more fully\r\ndeveloped, and when the new canal pours the commerce of Lake Superior\r\ninto Lake Erie. Cleveland is situated on the slope of a hill commanding\r\na beautiful and extensive view; the latter I was told, for as it rained\r\nincessantly, I had no opportunity of judging. Here we are at the\r\nstation, i.e., two hundred yards off it, which we are allowed to walk,\r\nso as to damp ourselves pleasantly before we start. Places taken, in we\r\nget; we move a few hundred yards, and come to a stand-still, waiting for\r\nanother train, which allows us the excitement of suspense for nearly an\r\nhour and a half, and then we really start for Cincinnati. The cars have\r\nthe usual attractions formerly enumerated: grin and bear it is the order\r\nof the day; scenery is shrouded in mist, night closes in with her sable\r\nmantle, and about eleven we reach the hotel, where, by the blessing of\r\na happy contrast, we soon forget the wretched day's work we have gone\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nHere we are in the \"Queen City of the West,\" the rapid rise whereof is\r\nastounding. By a statistical work, I find that in 1800 it numbered only\r\n750 inhabitants; in 1840, 46,338--1850, 115,438: these calculations\r\nmerely include its corporate limits. If the suburbs be added, the\r\npopulation will reach 150,000: of which number only about 3000 are\r\ncoloured. The Americans constitute 54 per cent.; Germans, 28; English,\r\n16; other foreigners, 2 per cent. of the population. They have 102\r\nschools, and 357 teachers, and 20,737 pupils are yearly instructed by\r\nthese means. Of these schools 19 are free, instructing 12,240 pupils,\r\nnot in mere writing and reading, but rising in the scale to \"algebra,\r\ngrammar, history, composition, declamation, music, drawing,\" &c. The\r\nannual cost of these schools is between 13,000l. and 14,000l. There\r\nis also a \"Central School,\" where the higher branches of literature and\r\nscience are taught to those who have time and talent; in short, a \"Free\r\nCollege.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the ordinance for the North-Western territory of 1787,\r\n\"religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good government\r\nand the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall\r\nfor ever be encouraged.\" Congress, in pursuance of this laudable object,\r\n\"has reserved one thirty-sixth part of all public lands for the support\r\nof education in the States in which the lands lie; besides which, it has\r\nadded endowments for numerous universities, &c.\" We have seen that the\r\npublic schools in this city cost 13,500l., of which sum they receive\r\nfrom the State fund above alluded to 1500l., the remainder being\r\nraised by a direct tax upon the property of the city, and increased from\r\ntime to time in proportion to the wants of the schools. One of the\r\nschools is for coloured children, and contains 360 pupils. There are 91\r\nchurches and 4 synagogues, and the population is thus classed--Jews, 3\r\nper cent.; Roman Catholics, 35; Protestant, 62. The Press is represented\r\nby 12 daily and 20 weekly papers. From these statistics, dry though they\r\nmay appear, one must confess that the means of education and religious\r\ninstruction are provided for in a manner that reflects the highest\r\ncredit on this \"Queen City of the West.\"\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly owing to the untiring perseverance of Mr. Longworth, that\r\nthey have partially succeeded in producing wine. As far as I could\r\nascertain, they made about fifty thousand gallons a year. The wine is\r\ncalled \"Catawba,\" from the grape, and is made both still and sparkling.\r\nThanks to the kind hospitality of a friend, I was enabled to taste the\r\nbest of each. I found the still wine rather thin and tart, but, as the\r\nweather was very cold, that need not affect the truth of my friend's\r\nassertion, that in summer it was a very pleasant beverage. The sparkling\r\nwine was much more palatable, and reminded me of a very superior kind of\r\nperry. They cannot afford to sell it on the spot under four shillings a\r\nbottle, and of course the hotels double that price immediately. I think\r\nthere can be no doubt that a decided improvement must be made in it\r\nbefore it can become valuable enough to find its way into the European\r\nmarket; although I must confess that, as it is, I should be most happy\r\nto see it supplant the poisonous liquids called champagne which appear\r\nat our \"suppers,\" and at many of our hotels.\r\n\r\nThe \"Burnet House\" is the principal hotel here, and afforded me every\r\ncomfort I could have expected, not the least being the satisfaction I\r\nderived from the sight of the proprietor, who, in the spotless\r\ncleanliness of his person and his \"dimity,\" and surrounded by hosts of\r\nhis travelling inmates--myself among the number--stood forth in bold\r\nrelief, like a snowball in a coal-hole.\r\n\r\nBut we must now visit the great lion of the place, whence the city\r\nobtains the _sobriquet_ of \"Porkopolis,\" i.e., the _auto da fé_ of the\r\nunclean animal. We will stroll down and begin at the beginning; but\r\nfirst let me warn you, if your nerves are at all delicate, to pass this\r\ndescription over, for, though perfectly true, it is very horrid. \"Poor\r\npiggy must die\" is a very old saying; whence it came I cannot tell; but\r\nwere it not for its great antiquity, Cincinnati might claim the honour.\r\nLet us however to the deadly work!\r\n\r\nThe post of slaughter is at the outskirts of the town, and as you\r\napproach it, the squeaking of endless droves proceeding to their doom\r\nfills the air, and in wet weather the muck they make is beyond\r\ndescription, as the roads and streets are carelessly made, and as\r\ncarelessly left to fate. When we were within a couple of hundred yards\r\nof the slaughter-house, they were absolutely knee-deep, and, there being\r\nno trottoir, we were compelled to wait till an empty cart came by, when,\r\nfor a small consideration, Jonathan ferried us through the mud-pond.\r\nBehind the house is the large pen in which the pigs are first gathered,\r\nand hence they are driven up an inclined plane into a small partition\r\nabout twelve feet square, capable of containing from ten to fifteen pigs\r\nat once. In this inclosure stands the executioner, armed with a\r\nhammer,--something in shape like that used to break stones for the roads\r\nin England--his shirt-sleeves turned up, so that nothing may impede the\r\nfree use of his brawny arms. The time arrived, down comes the hammer\r\nwith deadly accuracy on the forehead of poor piggy, generally killing\r\nbut sometimes only stunning him, in which case, as he awakes to\r\nconsciousness in the scalding caldron, his struggles are frightful to\r\nlook at, but happily very short. A trap-hatch opens at the side of this\r\nenclosure, through which the corpses are thrust into the sticking-room,\r\nwhence the blood flows into tanks beneath, to be sold, together with the\r\nhoofs and hair, to the manufacturers of prussiate of potash and Prussian\r\nblue. Thence they are pushed down an inclined plane into a trough\r\ncontaining a thousand gallons of boiling water, and broad enough to take\r\nin piggy lengthways. By the time they have passed down this caldron,\r\nthey are ready for scraping, for which purpose a large table is joined\r\non to the lower end of the caldron, and on which they are artistically\r\nthrown. Five men stand in a row on each side of the table, armed with\r\nscrapers, and, as piggy passes down, he gets scraped cleaner and\r\ncleaner, till the last polishes him as smooth as a yearling baby. Having\r\nthus reached the lower end of the table, there are a quantity of hooks\r\nfitted to strong wooden arms, which revolve round a stout pillar, and\r\nwhich, in describing the circle, plumb the lower end of the table. On\r\nthese piggy is hooked, and the operation of cutting open and cleansing\r\nis performed--at the rate of three a minute--by operators steeped in\r\nblood, and standing in an ocean of the same, despite the eternal buckets\r\nof water with which a host of boys keep deluging the floor. These\r\noperations finished, piggy is hung up on hooks to cool, and, when\r\nsufficiently so, he is removed thence to the other end of the building,\r\nready for sending to the preparing-houses, whither he and his defunct\r\nbrethren are convoyed in carts, open at the side, and containing about\r\nthirty pigs each.\r\n\r\nThe whole of this part of the town during porking season is alive with\r\nthese carts, and we will now follow one, so that we may see how piggy is\r\nfinally disposed of. The cart ascends the hill till it comes to a line\r\nof buildings with the canal running at the back thereof; a huge and\r\nsolid block lies ready for the corpse, and at each side appear a pair of\r\nbrawny arms grasping a long cleaver made scimitar-shape; smaller tables\r\nare around, and artists with sharp knives attend thereat. Piggy is\r\nbrought in from the cart, and laid on the solid block; one blow of the\r\nscimitar-shaped cleaver severs his head, which is thrown aside and sold\r\nin the town, chiefly, I believe, to Germans, though of course a Hebrew\r\nmight purchase if he had a fancy therefor. The head off, two blows sever\r\nhim lengthways; the hams, the shoulders, and the rib-pieces fly off at a\r\nblow each, and it has been stated that \"two hands, in less than thirteen\r\nhours, cut up eight hundred and fifty hogs, averaging over two hundred\r\npounds each, two others placing them on the blocks for the purpose. All\r\nthese hogs were weighed singly on the scales, in the course of eleven\r\nhours. Another hand trimmed the hams--seventeen hundred pieces--as fast\r\nas they were separated from the carcasses. The hogs were thus cut up and\r\ndisposed of at the rate of more than one to the minute.\" Knifemen then\r\ncome into play, cutting out the inner fat, and trimming the hams neatly,\r\nto send across the way for careful curing; the other parts are put in\r\nthe pickle-barrels, except the fat, which, after carefully removing all\r\nthe small pieces of meat that the first hasty cutting may have left, is\r\nthrown into a boiling caldron to be melted down into lard. Barring the\r\ntime taken up in the transit from the slaughter-house to these\r\ncutting-up stores, and the time he hangs to cool, it may be safely\r\nasserted, that from the moment piggy gets his first blow till his\r\ncarcass is curing and his fat boiling into lard, not more than five\r\nminutes elapse.\r\n\r\nA table of piggy statistics for one year may not be uninteresting to my\r\nreader, or, at all events, to an Irish pig-driver:--\r\n\r\n  180,000 Barrels of Pork, 196 lbs. each       35,280,000 lbs.\r\n  Bacon                                        25,000,000\r\n  No. 1 Lard                                   16,500,000\r\n  Star Candles, made by Hydraulic pressure.     2,500,000\r\n  Bar Soap                                      6,200,000\r\n  Fancy Soap, &c.                               8,800,000\r\n                                               ----------\r\n                                               94,280,000\r\nBesides Lard Oil, 1,200,000 gallons.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the activity exhibited may be formed, when I tell you that\r\nthe season for these labours averages only ten weeks, beginning with the\r\nsecond week in November and closing in January; and that the annual\r\nnumber cured at Cincinnati is about 500,000 head, and the value of these\r\nanimals when cured, &c., was estimated in 1851 at about 1,155,000l.\r\nWhat touching statistics the foregoing would be for a Hebrew or a\r\nMussulman! The wonder to me is, that the former can locate in such an\r\nunclean atmosphere; at all events, I hold it as a sure sign that there\r\nis money to be made.\r\n\r\nThey are very proud of their beef here, and it is very good; for they\r\npossess all the best English breeds, both here and across the river in\r\nKentucky. They stall-feed very fat, no doubt; but though generally very\r\ngood, I have never, in any part of the States, tasted beef equal to the\r\nbest in England. All the fat is on the outside; it is never marbled as\r\nthe best beef is with us. The price is very moderate, being about\r\nfourpence a pound.\r\n\r\nMonongahela whisky is a most important article of manufacture in the\r\nneighbourhood, being produced annually to the value of 560,000l. There\r\nare forty-four foundries, one-third of which are employed in the\r\nstove-trade; as many as a thousand stoves have been made in one day. The\r\nvalue of foundry products is estimated at 725,000l. annually.\r\n\r\nIf commerce be the true wealth and prosperity of a nation, there never\r\nwas a nation in the history of the world that possessed by nature the\r\nadvantages which this country enjoys. Take the map, and look at the\r\nposition of this city; nay, go two hundred miles higher up, to Marietta.\r\nFrom that port, which is nearly two thousand miles from the ocean, the\r\n\"Muskingum,\" a barque of three hundred and fifty tons, went laden with\r\nprovisions, direct to Liverpool, in 1845, and various other vessels have\r\nsince that time been built at Cincinnati; one, a vessel of eight hundred\r\nand fifty tons, called the \"Minnesota:\" in short, there is quite an\r\nactive business going on; shipbuilders from Maine coming here to carry\r\non their trade--wood, labour, and lodging being much cheaper than on\r\nthe Eastern coast.\r\n\r\nIt is now time to continue our journey, and as the water is high enough,\r\nwe will embark on the \"Ohio,\" and steam away to Louisville. The place\r\nyou embark from is called the levee: and as all the large towns on the\r\nriver have a levee, I may as well explain the term at once. It is\r\nnothing more nor less than the sloping off of the banks of a river, and\r\nthen paving them, by which operation two objects are gained:--first, the\r\nbanks are secured from the inroads of the stream; secondly, the boats\r\nare thereby enabled at all times to land passengers and cargo with\r\nperfect facility. These levees extend the whole length of the town, and\r\nare lined with steamers of all kinds and classes, but all built on a\r\nsimilar plan; and the number of them gives sure indication of the\r\ncommercial activity of Cincinnati. When a steamer is about to start,\r\nbook-pedlers crowd on board with baskets full of their--generally\r\nspeaking--trashy ware. Sometimes these pedlers are grown-up men, but\r\ngenerally boys about twelve or fourteen years of age. On going up to one\r\nof these latter, what was my astonishment to find in his basket, volume\r\nafter volume of publications such as Holywell-street scarce ever dared\r\nto exhibit; these he offered and commended with the most unblushing\r\neffrontery. The first lad having such a collection, I thought I would\r\nlook at the others, to see if their baskets were similarly supplied; I\r\nfound them all alike without exception, I then became curious to know if\r\nthese debauched little urchins found any purchasers, and, to ascertain\r\nthe fact, I ensconced myself among some of the freight, and watched one\r\nof them. Presently a passenger came up, and these books were brought to\r\nhis notice: he looked cautiously round, and, thinking himself\r\nunobserved, he began to examine them. The lad, finding the bait had\r\ntaken, then looked cautiously round on his side, and stealthily drew two\r\nmore books from his breast, evidently of the same kind, and it is\r\nreasonable to suppose infinitely worse. After a careful examination of\r\nthe various volumes, the passenger pulled out his purse, paid his money,\r\nand walked off with eight of these Holywell-street publications, taking\r\nthem immediately into his cabin. I saw one or two more purchasers,\r\nbefore I left my concealment. And now I may as well observe, that the\r\nsale of those works is not confined to one place; wherever I went on\r\nboard a steamer, I was sure to find boys with baskets of books, and\r\namong them many of the kind above alluded to. In talking to an American\r\ngentleman on this subject, he told me that it was indeed but too common\r\na practice, although by law nominally prohibited; and he further added,\r\nthat once asking a vendor why he had such blackguard books which nobody\r\nwould buy, he took up one of the worst, and said, \"Why, sir, this book\r\nis so eagerly sought after, that I have the utmost difficulty in keeping\r\nup the requisite supply.\" It is a melancholy reflection, that in a\r\ncountry where education is at every one's door, and poverty at no one's,\r\nsuch unblushing exhibitions of immorality should exist.\r\n\r\nWe embarked in the \"Lady Franklin,\" and were soon \"floating down the\r\nriver of the O-hi-o.\" The banks are undulating, and prettily\r\ninterspersed with cottage villas, which peep out from the woods, and are\r\nclotted about the more cultivated parts; but, despite this, the dreary\r\nmantle of winter threw a cold churlishness over everything. The boat I\r\nshall describe hereafter, when I have seen more of them, for their\r\ngeneral features are the same; but there was a specimen of the fair sex\r\non board, to whom I must introduce you, as I may never see her like\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe main piece was the counterpart of a large steamer's funnel cut off\r\nat about four feet two inches high, a most perfect cylinder, and of a\r\ndark greyish hue: a sombre coloured riband supported a ditto coloured\r\napron. If asked where this was fastened, I suppose she would have\r\nreplied, \"Round the waist, to be sure;\" yet, if Lord Rosse's telescope\r\nhad been applied, no such break in the smooth surface of the cylinder\r\ncould have been descried. The arms hung down on either side like the\r\nfunnel of a cabin stove, exciting the greatest wonder and the liveliest\r\ncuriosity to know how the skin of the shoulder obtained the elasticity\r\nrequisite to exhibit such a phenomenon. On the top of the cylinder was\r\na beautifully polished ebony pedestal, about two inches high on one\r\nside, tapering away to nothing at the other, so that whatever might be\r\nplaced thereon, would lie at an angle of forty-five degrees. This\r\npedestal did duty for a neck; and upon it was placed a thing which,\r\nviewed as a whole, resembled a demijohn. The lower part was pillowed on\r\nthe cylinder, no gleam of light ever penetrating between the two. Upon\r\nthe upper surface, at a proper distance from the extremity, two lips\r\nappeared, very like two pieces of raw beefsteak picked up off a dusty\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nWhile wrapt in admiration of this interesting spot, the owner thereof\r\nwas seized with a desire to yawn, to obtain which luxury it was\r\nrequisite to throw back the demijohn into nearly a horizontal line, so\r\nas to relieve the lower end from its pressure on the cylinder. The aid\r\nof both hands was called in to assist in supporting her intellectual\r\ndepository. This feat accomplished, a roseate gulf was revealed, which\r\nwould have made the stout heart of Quintus Curtius quail ere he took the\r\nawful plunge. Time or contest had removed the ivory obstructions in the\r\ncentre, but the shores on each side of the gulf were terrifically\r\niron-bound, and appeared equal to crushing the hardest granite; the\r\nshinbone of an ox would have been to her like an oyster to ordinary\r\nmortals. She revelled in this luxurious operation so long, that I began\r\nto fear she was suffering from the antipodes to a lockjaw, and that she\r\nwas unable to close the chasm; but at last the demijohn rose slowly and\r\nsolemnly from the horizontal, the gulf gradually closed until, obtaining\r\nthe old angle of forty-five degrees, the two dusty pieces of beefsteak\r\nonce more stood sentry over the abyss. Prosecuting my observations along\r\nthe upper surface, I next came to the proboscis, which suggested the\r\nidea of a Bologna sausage after a passage through a cotton-press. Along\r\nthe upper part, the limits were invisible, so beautifully did it blend\r\nwith the sable cheek on each side; but the lower part seemed to have\r\nbeen outside the press during the process, and therefore to have\r\nobtained unusual rotundity, thanks to which two nostrils appeared, which\r\nwould, for size, have excited the envy of the best bred Arab that was\r\never foaled; and the division between them was nearly equal to that of\r\nthe horse. I longed to hear her sneeze; it must have been something\r\nquite appallingly grand. Continuing my examination, I was forced to the\r\nconclusion that the poor delicate creature was bilious; for the dark\r\neyes gleamed from their round yellow beds like pieces of cannel-coal set\r\nin a gum-cistus. The forehead was a splendid prairie of flat table-land,\r\nbeyond which stretched a jungle of curly locks, like horse-hair ready\r\npicked for stuffing sofas, and being tied tightly round near the apex,\r\nthe neck of the bottle was formed, and the demijohn complete.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEWARDESS OF \"THE LADY FRANKLIN\"]\r\n\r\nI was very curious to see this twenty-five stone sylph in motion, and\r\nespecially anxious to have an opportunity of examining the pedestals by\r\nwhich she was supported and set in motion. After a little patience, I\r\nwas gratified to a certain extent, as the stately mass was summoned to\r\nher duties. By careful observation, I discovered the pedestals resembled\r\nflounders, out of which grew, from their centre, two cylinders, the\r\nankles deeply imbedded therein, and in no way disturbing the smooth\r\nsurface. All higher information was of course wrapt in the mystery of\r\nconjecture; but from the waddling gait and the shoulders working to and\r\nfro at every step, the concealed cylinders doubtless increased in size\r\nto such an extent, that the passing one before the other was a task of\r\nconsiderable difficulty; and if the motion was not dignified, it was\r\nimposingly slow, and seemed to call all the energies of the various\r\nmembers into action to accomplish its end. Even the demijohn rolled as\r\nif it were on a pivot, nodding grandly as the mighty stewardess of the\r\n\"Franklin\" proceeded to obey the summons. I watched her receding form,\r\nand felt that I had never before thoroughly realized the meaning of an\r\n\"armsful of joy,\" and I could not but wonder who was the happy possessor\r\nof this great blessing.\r\n\r\nIbrahim Pacha, when in England, was said to have had an intense desire\r\nto purchase two ladies, one aristocratic, the other horticultural, the\r\nsolidity of these ladies being their great point of attraction in his\r\nestimation. Had he but seen my lovely stewardess, I am sure he would\r\ninstantly have given up negotiations for both, could he thereby have\r\nhoped to obtain such a massive treasure as the \"Sylph of the\r\n'Franklin.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote J: Since I was there, General Cadwallader has taken the place\r\ninto his own hands.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote K: In case the expression is new to the reader, I beg to\r\ninform him that to \"whittle\" is to cut little chips of wood--if, when\r\nthe fit comes on, no stick is available, the table is sometimes operated\r\non.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote L: I believe the plan of making the canal-boats in sections is\r\noriginal; but the idea of dragging them up inclines to avoid expenses of\r\nlockage, &c., is of old date, having been practised as far back as 1792,\r\nupon a canal in the neighbourhood of Colebrook Dale, where the boats\r\nwere raised by stationary engines up two inclines, one of 207 feet, and\r\nthe other of 126 feet. I believe this is the first instance of the\r\nadoption of this plan, and the engineers were Messrs. Reynolds and\r\nWilliams. The American inclines being so much greater, the dividing the\r\nboat into sections appears to me an improvement.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n_Scenes Ashore and Afloat_.\r\n\r\n\r\nA trip on a muddy river, whose banks are fringed with a leafless forest\r\nresembling a huge store of Brobdignagian stable brooms, may be\r\nfavourable to reflection; but, if description be attempted, there is\r\ndanger lest the brooms sweep the ideas into the muddy water of dulness.\r\nOut of consideration therefore to the reader, we will suppose ourselves\r\ndisembarked at Louisville, with the intention of travelling inland to\r\nvisit the leviathan wonder--the would-be rival to Niagara,--yclept \"The\r\nMammoth Cave.\" Its distance from Louisville is ninety-five miles. There\r\nis no such thing as a relay of horses to be met with--at all events, it\r\nis problematical; therefore, as the roads were execrable, we were\r\ninformed it would take us two long days, and our informant strongly\r\nadvised us to go by the mail, which only employs twenty-one hours to\r\nmake the ninety-five miles' journey. There was no help for it; so, with\r\na sigh of sad expectation, I resigned myself to my fate, of which I had\r\nexperienced a short foretaste on my way to Pittsburg. I then inquired\r\nwhat lions the town offered to interest a traveller. I found there was\r\nlittle in that way, unless I wished to go through the pig-killing,\r\nscalding, and cutting process again; but stomach and imagination\r\nrebelled at the bare thought of a second edition of the bloody scene, so\r\nI was fain to content myself with the novelty of the tobacco pressing;\r\nand, as tobacco is the favourite _bonbon_ of the country, I may as well\r\ndescribe the process which the precious vegetable goes through ere it\r\nmingles with the human saliva.\r\n\r\nA due admixture of whites and blacks assemble together, and, damping the\r\ntobacco, extract all the large stems and fibres, which are then\r\ncarefully laid aside ready for export to Europe, there to be cooked up\r\nfor the noses of monarchs, old maids, and all others who aspire to the\r\nhonour and glory of carrying a box--not forgetting those who carry it in\r\nthe waistcoat-pocket, and funnel it up the nose with a goose-quill. How\r\nbeautifully simple and unanswerable is the oft-told tale, of the reply\r\nof a testy old gentleman who hated snuff as much as a certain elderly\r\nperson is said to hate holy-water--when offered a pinch by an\r\n\"extensive\" young man with an elaborate gold-box. \"Sir,\" said the\r\nindignant patriarch, \"I never take the filthy stuff! If the Almighty had\r\nintended my nostrils for a dust-pan, he would have turned them the other\r\nway.\"--But I wander from the subject. We will leave the fibre to find\r\nits way to Europe and its noses, and follow the leaf to America and its\r\nmouths. In another apartment niggers and whites re-pick the fibres out\r\nmore carefully, and then roll up the pure loaf in a cylindrical shape,\r\naccording to the measure provided for the purpose. It is then taken to\r\nanother apartment, and placed in duly prepared compartments under a\r\nstrong screw-press, by which operation it is transformed from a loose\r\ncylinder to a well squashed parallelogram. It is hard work, and the\r\nswarthy descendants of Ham look as if they were in a vapour-bath, and\r\ndoubtless bedew the leaf with superfluous heat.\r\n\r\nAfter the first pressing, it goes to a more artistic old negro, who,\r\nwith two buckets of water--one like pea-soup, the other as dark as if\r\nsome of his children had been boiled down in it--and armed with a sponge\r\nof most uninviting appearance, applies these liquids with most\r\nscientific touch, thereby managing to change the colour, and marble it,\r\ndarken it, or lighten it, so as to suit the various tastes. This\r\noperation completed, and perspiring negroes screwing down frantically,\r\nit is forced into the box prepared for its reception, which is imbedded\r\nin a strong iron-bound outer case during the process, to prevent the\r\nmore fragile one from bursting under the pressure. All this over, and\r\nthe top fixed, a master-painter covers it with red and black paint,\r\nrecording its virtues and its charms. What a pity it could not lie in\r\nits snug bed for ever! But, alas! fate and the transatlantic Anglo-Saxon\r\nhave decreed otherwise. Too short are its slumbers, too soon it bursts\r\nagain, to suffer fresh pressure under the molars of the free and\r\nenlightened, and to fall in filthy showers over the length and breadth\r\nof the land, deluging every house and every vehicle to a degree that\r\nmust be seen to be believed, and filling the stranger with much wonder,\r\nbut far more disgust. I really think it must be chewing tobacco which\r\nmakes the Americans so much more restless, so much more like armadillos\r\nthan any other nation. It often has excited my wonder, how the more\r\nintelligent and civilized portion of the community, who do not generally\r\nindulge in the loathsome practice, can reconcile themselves to the\r\nannoyance of it as kindly as they do. Habit and necessity are powerful\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\nHaving finished this exhibition--which, by the way, kept me sneezing all\r\nthe time--I went next to see a steam sawing, planing, and fitting mill.\r\nLabour being very expensive, these establishments are invaluable here;\r\nsuch an establishment as I saw could supply, from the raw wood in logs,\r\nall the doors and window-frames of \"Stafford House\" in three days,\r\nbarring the polish and paint. If Mr. Cubitt is not up to this machinery,\r\nthis hint may be the means of making his fortune double itself in\r\n\"quarter-less no time.\"[M] As we knew that our journey to-morrow must be\r\ninexpressibly tedious, we beat an early retreat, requesting a cup of hot\r\ntea or coffee might be ready for us half an hour before our departure.\r\nPoor simple creatures that we were, to expect such a thing! The free and\r\nenlightened get their breakfast after being two hours _en route_, and\r\ncan do without anything before starting--_ergo_, we must do the same:\r\nthus, though there were literally servants enough in the house to form a\r\nsubstantial militia regiment, a cup of tea was impossible to be obtained\r\nfor love or money. All we had for it was to bury our disappointment in\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nSoon after three the next morning we were roused from our slumbers, and,\r\nfinishing our toilet, cheered our insides with an unadulterated draught\r\nfrom the Ohio. All outside the door was dark, cheerless, solitary, and\r\nstill. Presently the silence was broken by some violent puffs from a\r\npenny trumpet. \"Dat's de mayle, massa,\" said a nigger in the hall,\r\naccompanying his observation with a mysterious grin, evidently meant to\r\nconvey the idea, \"You'll have enough of her before you've done.\" Up she\r\ncame to the door--I believe, by custom if not by grammar, a man-of-war\r\nand a mail-coach are shes--a heavy, lumbering machine, with springs,\r\n&c., apparently intended for scaling the Rocky Mountains. The inside\r\nwas about three feet broad and five feet long, and was intended for the\r\nconvenience (?) of nine people, the three who occupied the centre seat\r\nhaving a moveable leather strap to support their backs. Outside, there\r\nwas one seat by the coachman; and if the correspondence was not great,\r\nthree more might sit behind the coachman, in all the full enjoyment of a\r\nsplendidly cramped position. The sides of the carriage were made of\r\nleather, and fitted with buttons, for the purpose of opening in summer.\r\nBeing a nasty drizzling morning, we got inside, with our two servants,\r\nand found we had it all to ourselves. \"I am sure this is comfortable\r\nenough,\" observed my companion, who was one of the mildest and most\r\ncontented of human beings. \"Too good to last long,\" thought I.\r\n\r\nThe penny trumpet sounds, and off we go--not on our journey, but all\r\nover the town to the different hotels, to pick up live freight. I\r\nheartily hoped they might all oversleep themselves that morning. Alas!\r\nno such luck. Jonathan and a weasel are two animals that are very rarely\r\ncaught napping. Passengers kept coming in until we were six, and\r\n\"comfortable enough\" became a misnomer. A furious blast of the tin tube,\r\nwith a few spicy impromptu variations, portended something important,\r\nand, as we pulled up, we saw it was the post-office; but, murder of\r\nmurders! we saw four more passengers! One got up outside; another was\r\nfollowing; Jarvey stopped him, with--\"I guess there aint no room up here\r\nfor you; the mail's a-coming here.\" The door opened,--the three damp\r\nbodkins in line commenced their assault,--the last came between my\r\ncompanion and myself, I could not see much of him, it was so dark;\r\nbut--woe is me!--there are other senses besides sight, and my\r\nunfortunate nostrils drank in a most foetid polecatty odour, ever\r\nincreasing as he drew nearer and nearer. Room to sit there was none;\r\nbut, at the blast of the tube, the rattle over the pitty pavement soon\r\nshook the obnoxious animal down between us, squeezing the poisonous\r\nexhalation out of him at each successive jolt. As dawn rose, we saw he\r\nwas a German, and doubtless the poor fellow was very hard-up for money,\r\nand had been feeding for some time past on putrid pork. As for his hide\r\nand his linen, it would have been an unwarrantable tax upon his memory\r\nto have asked him when they had last come in contact with soap and\r\nwater. My stomach felt like the Bay of Biscay in an equinoctial gale,\r\nand I heartily wished I could have dispensed with the two holes at the\r\nbottom of my nose. I dreaded asking how far he was going; but another\r\npassenger--under the influence of the human nosegay he was constrained\r\nto inhale--summed up the courage to pop the question, and received a\r\nreply which extinguished in my breast the last flickering ray of Hope's\r\ndim taper--\"Sair, I vosh go to Nashveele.\" Only conceive the horror of\r\nbeing squashed into such a neighbour for twenty-one long hours, and over\r\na road that necessarily kept jerking the unwashed and polecatty head\r\ninto your face ten times in a minute! Who that has bowels of compassion\r\nbut must commiserate me in such \"untoward circumstances?\"\r\n\r\nAlthough we had left the hotel at four, it was five before we left the\r\ntown, and about seven before we unpacked for breakfast, nine miles out\r\nof town. The stench of my neighbour had effectually banished all idea of\r\neating or drinking from my mind; so I walked up and down outside,\r\nsmoking my cigar, and thinking \"What can I do?\" At last, the bright idea\r\nstruck me--I will get in next time with my cigar; what if we are nine\r\nherrings in the barrel?--everybody smokes in this country--they won't\r\nobject--and I think, by keeping the steam well up, I can neutralize a\r\nlittle of the polecat. So when the time came for starting, I got my big\r\ncigar-case, &c., out on my knees--as getting at your pockets, when once\r\npacked, was impossible--and entering boldly with my weed at high\r\npressure, down I sat. We all gradually shook into our places. Very soon\r\na passenger looked me steadily in the face; he evidently was going to\r\nspeak; I quailed inwardly, dreading he was going to object to the smell\r\nof smoke. Oh, joyous sight! a cigar appeared between his fingers, and\r\nthe re-assuring words came forth--\"A light, sir, if you please.\" I never\r\ngave one more readily in my life. Gradually, passenger after passenger\r\nproduced cigars; the aroma filled the coach, and the fragrance of the\r\nweed triumphed over the foetor of the polecat. Six insides out of nine\r\nhard at it, and four of them with knock-me-down Virginia tobacco, the\r\nsingle human odour could not contend against such powerful odds; as well\r\nmight a musquito sneeze against thunder. I always loved a cigar; but\r\nhere I learnt its true value in a desperate emergency.\r\n\r\nOn we went, puffing, pumping, and jolting, till at last we came to a\r\nstand on the banks of a river. As there was a reasonable probability of\r\nthe mail shooting into the stream on its descent, we were told to get\r\nout, on doing which we found ourselves pleasantly situated about a foot\r\ndeep in mud; the mail got down safe into an open ferry-boat with two\r\noars, and space for passengers before the horses or behind the coach.\r\nThe ferry was but for a few minutes, and we then had to ascend another\r\nbank of mud, at the top of which we retook our seats in the mail,\r\nbringing with us in the aggregate, about a hundredweight of fine clay\r\nsoil, with which additional cargo we continued our journey. One o'clock\r\nbrought us to Elizabeth Town, and dinner; the latter was very primitive,\r\ntough, and greasy.\r\n\r\nOnce more we entered our cells, and continued our route, the bad road\r\ngetting worse and worse, rarely allowing us to go out of a walk. Two of\r\nour fellow-passengers managed to make themselves as offensive as\r\npossible. They seemed to be travelling bagmen of the lowest class.\r\nConversation they had none, but by way of appearing witty, they kept\r\nrepeating over and over again some four or five stories, laughing at one\r\nanother's tales, which were either blasphemous or beastly--so much so,\r\nthat I would most willingly have compounded for two more human polecats\r\nin lieu of them. I must say, that although all classes mix together in\r\npublic conveyances, this was the first time I had ever found people\r\nconduct themselves in so disgusting a manner. We soon came to another\r\nriver, and getting out, enjoyed a second mud walk, bringing in with us\r\nas before a rich cargo of clay soil; and after a continuous and\r\nincreasing jolting, which threatened momentary and universal\r\ndislocation, we arrived, after a drive of twenty-one hours, at our\r\njourney's end--i.e., at \"Old Bell's,\" so called from the proprietor of\r\nthe inn. Here we were to pass the night, or rather the remainder of it,\r\nthe mail going on to Nashville, and taking our foetid bodkin on with it.\r\nBut, alas! the two more disagreeable passengers before alluded to\r\nremained, as they had suddenly made up their minds to stay and visit the\r\nMammoth Cave.\r\n\r\nOld Bell is a venerable specimen of seventy odd years of age, and has\r\nbeen here, I believe, half a century nearly. One of his daughters, I am\r\ntold, is very pretty. She is married to a senator of the United States,\r\nand keeps one of the most agreeable houses in Washington. The old\r\ngentleman is said to be worth some money, but he evidently is determined\r\nto die in harness. As regularly as the mail arrives, about one in the\r\nmorning, so regularly does he turn out and welcome the passengers with a\r\nglass of mixed honey, brandy, and water. The beverage and the donor\r\nreminded me forcibly of \"Old Crerer,\" and the \"Athole Brose,\" with which\r\nhe always welcomed those who visited him in his Highland cottage. Having\r\ngot beds to ourselves--after repeated requests to roost two in a nest,\r\nas the house was small--I soon tumbled into my lair, and in the blessed\r\nforgetfulness of sleep the miseries of the day became mingled with the\r\nthings that were. The next morning, after breakfast, we got a conveyance\r\nto take the party over to the Cave, a distance of seven miles. One may\r\nreally say there is no road. For at least one half of the way there is\r\nnothing but a rugged track of rock and roots of trees, ever threatening\r\nthe springs of the carriage and the limbs of the passenger with\r\nfrightful fractures. However, by walking over the worst of it, you\r\nprotect the latter and save the former, thus rendering accidents of rare\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nThe hotel is a straggling building, chiefly ground floor, and with a\r\nverandah all round. The air is deliriously pure, and in summer it must\r\nbe lovely. It is situated on a plateau, from the extremity of which the\r\nbank descends to the Green River. On both sides is the wild forest, and\r\nround the giant trunks the enamoured vine twines itself with the\r\naffectionate pertinacity of a hungry boa-constrictor, and boars its head\r\nin triumph to the topmost branches. But vegetable life is not like a\r\nVenus who, \"when unadorned, is adorned the most;\" and, the forest having\r\ncast off its summer attire, presents an uninviting aspect in the cold\r\nnudity of winter. When the virgin foliage of spring appears, and ripens\r\ninto the full verdure of summer, the shade of these banks must be\r\ndelicious; the broad-leaved and loving vine extending its matrimonial\r\nembrace as freely and universally through the forest as Joe Smith and\r\nhis brethren do theirs among the ladies at the Salt Lake; and when\r\nautumn arrives, with those gorgeous glowing tints unknown to the Old\r\nWorld, the scene must be altogether lovely; then the admirer of nature,\r\nfloating between the banks on the light-green bosom of the stream below,\r\nand watching the ever-changing tints, as the sun dropped softly into his\r\ncouch in the west, would enjoy a feast that memory might in vain try to\r\nexhaust itself in recalling.\r\n\r\nThere are guides appointed who provide lanterns and torches for visitors\r\nwho wish to examine the Mammoth Cave; and its interior is such a\r\nlabyrinth, that, without their aid, the task would be a dangerous one.\r\nRough clothing is provided at the hotel, the excursion being one of\r\nscramble and difficulty.\r\n\r\nThus prepared, we started on our exploring expedition, passing at the\r\nentry the remnants of old saltpetre works, which were established here\r\nduring the struggle at New Orleans. The extent of this cave would render\r\na detail tedious, as there are comparatively few objects of interest.\r\nThe greatest marvel is a breed of small white fish without eyes, several\r\nof which are always to be seen. Like all similar places, it varies in\r\nsize in the most arbitrary manner. At one minute you are struggling for\r\nspace, and suddenly you emerge upon a Gothic-looking hall, full of\r\ngracefully pendent stalactites. Again you proceed along corridors, at\r\none time lofty, at another threatening your head, if pride do not give\r\nway to humility. Then you come to rivers, of which there are two. At one\r\ntime you are rowing under a magnificent vault, and then, anon, you are\r\nforced to lie flat down in the boat, or leave your head behind you, as\r\nyou float through a passage, the roof whereof grazes the gunwale of the\r\nboat. My guide informed me that there was a peculiarity in these rivers\r\nnobody could satisfactorily account for, viz., that the more it rained,\r\nthe lower these waters fell. I expect the problem resembled that which\r\nis attributed to King Charles, viz., \"How it was, that if a dead fish\r\nwas put into a vessel full of water it immediately overflowed, but that,\r\nif a live fish was put in, it did not do so;\" and I have some suspicion\r\nthe solution is the same in both cases. Among other strange places, is\r\none which rejoices in the name of \"Fat Man's Misery.\" At one minute the\r\nfeet get fixed as in the stocks; at another, the upper portion of the\r\nbody is called upon to make a right angle with the lower; even then, a\r\nprojecting point of the rock above will sometimes prod you upon the\r\nupturned angle, in endeavouring to save which, by a too rapid act of\r\nhumility, you knock all the skin off the more vulnerable knee. Emerging\r\nfrom this difficulty, and, perhaps, rising too hastily, a crack on the\r\nhead closes your eyes, filling them with a vision of forked lightning.\r\nRecovering from this agreeable sensation, you find a gap like the edge\r\nof a razor, in going through which, you feel the buttons of your\r\nwaistcoat rubbing against your backbone. It certainly would be no bad\r\nhalf-hour's recreation to watch a rotund Lord Mayor, followed by a court\r\nof aldermen to match, forcing their way through this pass after a turtle\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nThe last place I shall mention is the one which, to me, afforded the\r\ngreatest pleasure: it is a large hall, in which, after being placed in a\r\nparticular position, the guide retires to a distance, taking with him\r\nall the lights; and knowing by experience what portion of them to\r\nconceal, bids you, when he is ready, look overhead. In a few seconds it\r\nhas the appearance of the sky upon a dark night; but, as the eye becomes\r\naccustomed to the darkness, small spots are seen like stars; and they\r\nkeep increasing till the vaulted roof has the appearance of a lovely\r\nstar-light night. I never saw a more pleasing or perfect illusion. It\r\nwould be difficult to estimate correctly the size of the Mammoth Cave.\r\nThe American gazetteers say it extends ten or twelve miles, and has\r\nlateral branches, which, altogether, amount to forty miles. It is, I\r\nimagine, second in size only to the Cacuhuainilpa, in Mexico, which, if\r\nthe accounts given are accurate, would take half a dozen such as the\r\nMammoth inside. I fear it is almost superfluous to inform the reader,\r\nthat the Anglo-Saxon keeps up his unenviable character for disfiguring\r\nevery place he visits; and you consequently see the names of Smith,\r\nBrown, Snooks, &c., smoked on the rocks in all directions--an\r\nappropriate sooty record of a barbarous practice.[N]\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving enjoyed two days in exploring this \"gigantic freak of Nature,\"\r\nwe commenced our return about half-past four in the afternoon, so as to\r\nget over the break-neck track before dark. Old Bell[O] welcomed us as\r\nusual with his honey, brandy, and water. He then prepared us some\r\ndinner, as we wished to snatch a few hours' sleep before commencing our\r\nreturn to Louisville, with its twenty-one hours of pleasure. About\r\nhalf-past ten at night, a blast in the breeze, mixed with a confused\r\nslushy sound, as sixteen hoofs plashed in the mud, rang the knell in our\r\nears, \"Your time has come!\" I anxiously looked as the mail pulled up in\r\nthe middle of the road opposite to the door--they always allow the\r\npassengers the privilege of wading through the mud to the door of the\r\ninn--to see if by any chance it was empty, having been told that but few\r\npeople comparatively travelled the back route--no wonder, if they could\r\nhelp it. Alas! the steam on the window announced, with fatal certainty,\r\nsome humanities inside. The door opened; out they came, one, two, three,\r\nfour. It was a small coach, with three seats, having only space for two\r\npersons on each, thus leaving places inside for my friend and myself.\r\n\"Any room outside, there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Room for one, sir!\"\r\n\r\nThere was no help for it, and we were therefore obliged to leave one\r\nservant behind, to follow next night.\r\n\r\nHorses changed, honey-toddy all drank, in we got into the centre seat.\r\n\"What is this all round?\" \"Thick drugget, sir; they nail it round in\r\nwinter to keep the cold out.\"--Thank Heaven, it is only nailed at the\r\nbottom. Suffocation began; down goes my window. Presently a\r\nsixteen-stone kind of overgrown Pickwickian \"Fat Boy,\" sitting opposite\r\nme, exclaims aloud, with a polar shudder, \"Ugh! it's very cold!\" and\r\nfinding I was inattentive, he added, \"Don't you find it very cold?\" \"Me,\r\nsir? I'm nearly fainting from heat,\" I replied; and then, in charity, I\r\nlent him a heavy full-sized Inverness plaid, in which he speedily\r\nenveloped his fat carcass. What with the plaids, and his five inches\r\ndeep of fat, his bones must have been in a vapour bath. The other\r\n_vis-à-vis_ was a source of uneasiness to me on a different score. He\r\nkept up a perpetual expectorating discharge; and, as my open window\r\nwas the only outlet, and it did not come that way, I naturally felt\r\nanxious for my clothes. Daylight gradually dawned upon the scene, and\r\nthen the ingenuity of my friend was made manifest in a way calculated to\r\nmove any stomach not hardened by American travelling. Whenever he had\r\nexpressed the maximum quantity of juice from the tobacco, the drugget\r\nlining was moved sufficiently for him to discharge his cargo against the\r\ninside of the carriage; after which, the drugget was replaced, and the\r\neffect of the discharge concealed thereby. This drugget lining must have\r\nbeen invaluable to him; for upon another occasion, it did duty for a\r\npocket-handkerchief. I must say, that when I saw the otherwise\r\nrespectable appearance of the culprit, his filthy practices astounded\r\nme. Behind us were two gentlemen who were returning to Louisville, and\r\nwhom we found very agreeable.\r\n\r\nWe stopped for breakfast at a wayside pot-house sort of place; but,\r\nbefore feasting, we wanted to wash ourselves. The conveniences for that\r\npurpose were a jug, a basin, and a piece of soap, on a bench in the open\r\ncourt, which, as it was raining pretty smartly, was a very ingenious\r\nmethod of dissuasion, particularly as your pocket-handkerchief, or the\r\nsleeve of your shirt, had to supply the place of a towel. The meal was\r\nas dissuasive as the washing arrangements, and I was glad when the\r\ntrumpet summoned us to coach. I made an effort to sleep, for which\r\npurpose I closed my eyes, but in vain; however, the expectorating\r\n_vis-à-vis,_ who was also a chilly bird, thought he had caught me\r\nnapping, and said to his fat neighbour,--\"I say, the old gentleman's\r\nasleep, pull up the window.\" The fat 'un did so, and I kept perfectly\r\nquiet. In a few minutes I began to breathe heavily, and then, awaking as\r\nit were with a groan, I complained of suffocation, and, dashing down the\r\nwindow, poked out my head and panted for fresh air: they were very civil\r\nall the rest of the journey, and never asked for the window to be shut\r\nagain. In the course of the day, I found out that the fat boy opposite\r\nwas connected with a circus company, and from him I gleaned something of\r\ntheir history, which I hope may not be uninteresting to the reader.\r\n\r\nEach company has a puffer, or advertiser, who is sent on a week before\r\nthe company, to get bills printed, and see them posted up and\r\ndistributed to the best advantage, in the places at which the company\r\nintend to perform. This was the fat boy's occupation, and for it he\r\nreceived eight pounds a month and his travelling expenses.\r\n\r\nHis company consisted of seventy-five bipeds and one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five quadrupeds. Of the bipeds, twelve were performers, two being\r\nwomen; the pay varied from sixteen pounds a month to the chief Amazonian\r\nlady, down as low as five pounds a month to the least efficient of the\r\ncorps. They work all the year round, sucking their cents from the North\r\nin summer, and from the South in winter. They carry everything with\r\nthem, except it may be fuel and provisions. Each has his special duty\r\nappointed. After acting at night they retire to their tents to sleep,\r\nand the proper people take the circus-tent down, and start at once for\r\nthe next place they are to appear at; the performers and their tent-men\r\nrise early in the morning, and start so as to reach the ground about\r\neleven; they then rest and prepare, so as to be ready, after the people\r\nof the village have dined, to give their first performance; then they\r\nrest and refresh ready for their evening repetition. Some companies used\r\nto make their own gas, but experience has proved that wax-lights are\r\nsweeter and cheaper in the long run, so gas making is nearly exploded.\r\nAfter this second performance they retire to rest; the circus tent-men\r\nstrike and pack the tent, then start off for the next place of\r\nexhibition, the actors and their tents following as before mentioned:\r\nthus they go on throughout the year, bipeds and quadrupeds scarcely ever\r\nentering a house.\r\n\r\nThere are numbers of these circus companies in the States, of which the\r\nlargest is the one to which Van Amburgh is attached, and which, the fat\r\nboy told me, is about three times the size of his own--Van Amburgh\r\ntaking always upwards of a dozen cages of his wild beasts. The work, he\r\nsays, is very hard, but the money comes in pretty freely, which I can\r\nreadily believe, as the bump of Inquisitiveness grows here with a\r\nluxuriance unknown elsewhere, and is only exceeded by its sister bump of\r\nAcquisitiveness, which two organs constitute audience and actors.\r\n\r\nI give you no account of scenery on the road for two reasons: first,\r\nbecause there are no striking features to relieve the alternations of\r\nrude cultivation and ruder forest; and secondly, because in winter,\r\nNature being despoiled of the life-giving lines of herbage and foliage,\r\na sketch of dreariness would be all that truth could permit. I will\r\ntherefore beg you to consider the twenty-one hours past, and Louisville\r\nreached in safety, where hot tea and \"trimmings\"--as the astute young\r\nSamivel hath it--soon restored us from the fatigues of a snail-paced\r\njourney, over the most abominable road a man can imagine, although it is\r\nthe mail route between the flourishing towns of Louisville and\r\nNashville. Should any ambitious spirit feel a burning desire to visit\r\nthe Mammoth Cave, let me advise him to slake the said flame with the\r\nwaters of Patience, and take for his motto--\"I bide my time.\" Snoring\r\nhas been the order of the day in these parts for many years; but the\r\nkettle-screaming roads of the North have at last disturbed the Southern\r\nslumberers, and, like giants refreshed, they are now working vigorously\r\nat their own kettle, which will soon hiss all the way from Louisville to\r\nNashville. Till then, I say, Patience.--One of our companions in the\r\nstage very kindly offered to take us to the club, which is newly formed\r\nhere, and which, if not large, is very comfortable. I mention this as\r\none among the many instances which have occurred to me while travelling\r\nin this country, of the desire exhibited by the better classes to show\r\ncivility and attention to any gentleman who they observe is a stranger\r\namong them.\r\n\r\nThe following morning we were obliged to continue our route, for which\r\npurpose it was necessary to embark two miles below the town, as the\r\nriver was not high enough to allow the steamers to pass over a kind of\r\nbar called \"The Falls.\" The road was one continuous bog of foot-deep\r\nmud, but that difficulty concerned the horses, and they got over it with\r\nperfect ease, despite the heavy drag. Once more we were floating down\r\nthe Ohio, and, curiously enough, in, another \"Franklin;\" but she could\r\nnot boast of such a massive cylindrical stewardess as her sister\r\npossessed. A host of people, as usual, were gathered round the bar,\r\ndrinking, smoking, and arguing. Jonathan is \"first-chop\" at an argument.\r\nTwo of them were hard at it as I walked up.\r\n\r\nSays the Colonel--\"I tell you, Major, it is more than a hundred miles.\"\r\n\r\nMajor--\"Well, but I tell you, Colonel, it aint not no such thing.\"\r\n\r\nColonel--\"But, sir'ree, I know it is.\"\r\n\r\nJudge--\"Well, Colonel, I tell you what it is; I reckon you're wrong.\"\r\n\r\nColonel--getting evidently excited--\"No, sir'ree, I aint, and,\"--holding\r\nout a brawny hand capable of scrunching a nine-pound shot into infant\r\npap--\"darned if I wont lay you, or any other gentleman, six Kentucky\r\nniggers to a julep I'm right.\"\r\n\r\nAfter offering these tremendous odds, he travelled his fiery eagle eyes\r\nfrom the major to the judge, and from the judge to the major, to\r\nascertain which of them would have it; and as they were silent, he\r\nextended the radius of his glance to the company around, chucking his\r\nhead, and looking out of the corner of his eye, from time to time,\r\ntowards major and judge with a triumphant sneer, as much as to say,\r\n\"I've fixed you, anyhow.\" The argument was over; whether the major and\r\nthe judge were right about the distance, or not, I cannot decide; but if\r\nthe bet, when accepted, had to be ratified in the grasp of the muscular\r\nhand which the colonel extended, they were decidedly right in not\r\naccepting it, as some painful surgical operation must have followed such\r\na crushing and dislocation as his gripe inevitably portended. I would as\r\nsoon have put my hand between the rollers of a cane-press.\r\n\r\nThe feeding arrangements for the humanities on board were, if\r\ndisagreeable, sufficiently amusing once in a way. A table extends nearly\r\nthe whole length of the gentlemen's saloon; on each side are ranged low\r\nwooden straight-back arm-chairs, of a breadth well suited for the ghost\r\n_qui n'avait pas de quoi_. But the unfortunate man who happened to be\r\nvery well supplied therewith, ran considerable risk of finding the chair\r\na permanent appendage. At the sound of the bell, all the seats being\r\narranged opposite the respective places, the men rush forward and place\r\nthemselves behind the said chairs, and, like true cavaliers, stand there\r\ntill the ladies are seated. I was standing waiting among the rest, and\r\ngetting impatient as time flew on. One lady had not yet arrived. At last\r\nthe steward came with the said article on his arm, and having deposited\r\nher in the seat nearly opposite mine, at a knowing wink from him, a\r\nsecond steward sounded another bell, and the men dropped into their\r\nseats like magic. Soup having been already served, the spoons rattled\r\naway furiously. I was wondering who the lady--all females are ladies\r\nhere--could be, for whom we had been so long waiting, and who had\r\neventually come in with the steward, or gentleman--all men are gentlemen\r\nhere--in so friendly a manner. She did not appear burdened with any\r\nrefined manners, but, judge of my astonishment when, after she had got\r\nquit of her soup-plate and was waiting for her next helping, I observed\r\nthe lady poking the point of her knife into a sweet dish near her, and\r\nsucking off the precious morsel she had captured, which interesting\r\noperation she kept repeating till her roast turkey arrived. There was an\r\nair of such perfect innocence about her, as she was employed in the\r\nsucking process, that you could not help feeling she was unconscious any\r\neye fixed upon her could find her occupation offensive or extraordinary.\r\n\r\nA gentleman seated near me next attracted my attention. They had helped\r\nhim to a piece of meat the size and shape of a Holborn-hill\r\npaving-stone. How insulted he must be at having his plate filled in that\r\nway. Look! look! how he seizes vegetable after vegetable, building his\r\nplate all round, like a fortification, the junk of beef in the middle\r\nforming the citadel. It would have taken Napoleon a whole day to have\r\ncaptured such a fortress; but, remember, poor Napoleon did not belong to\r\nthe nation that can \"whip creation.\" See how Jonathan batters down\r\nbastion after bastion! Now he stops!--his piercing eye scrutinizes\r\naround!--a pie is seen! With raised body and lengthened arm, he pounces\r\non it, and drags it under the guns of his fortress. Knives and forks are\r\nscarce--his own will do very well. A breach is made--the pastry parapet\r\nis thrown at the foot of the half-demolished citadel; spoons are not at\r\nhand, the knife plunges into the abyss, the fork follows--'tis a chicken\r\npie--pillage ensues; all the white meat is captured, the dish is raised\r\non high, from the horizontal it is turned to the \"slantindicular,\" and\r\nthe citadel is deluged in the shower. \"Catch who can,\" is not confined\r\nto school-boys, I see. I was curious to witness the end of this attack,\r\nand, as he had enough to occupy his ivories for half an hour--if they\r\ndid not give in before--I turned quietly to my own affairs, and began\r\neating my dinner; but, curiosity is impatient. In a few minutes, I\r\nturned back to gaze on the fortress. By Jupiter Tonans! the plate lay\r\nbefore him, clean as if a cat had licked it; and, having succeeded in\r\ncapturing another plate, he was organizing on this new plateau various\r\nbattalions of sweets, for which he skirmished around with incomparable\r\nskill.\r\n\r\nThe parade-ground being full, I expected to see an instant attack; but\r\nhe was too knowing to be caught napping in that way. He looked around,\r\nand with a masterly eye scanned apples, oranges, and nuts. The two\r\nformer he selected with great judgment; the latter he brought home in\r\nquantities sufficient to secure plenty of good ones. Then pouncing upon\r\na pair of nutcrackers, and extending them like a chevaux-de-frise round\r\nhis prizes, he began his onslaught upon the battalion of sweets before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe great general now set seriously to work. Scarce had he commenced,\r\nwhen an innocent young man, who had finished his sweets and was\r\nmeditating an attack on some nuts, espied the crackers lying idle before\r\nthe gastronomic general, and said, \"Will you lend me the nutcrackers,\r\nsir?\" The great general raised his head, and gave the youth one of those\r\npiercing looks with which Napoleon used to galvanize all askers of\r\nimpertinent questions. The youth, understanding the refusal conveyed in\r\nthat terrible glance, had however enough courage to add, \"You don't want\r\nthem, sir!\" This was too much to bear in silence; so he replied with\r\nawful distinctness, \"But I reckon I shall, sir!\" Then dropping his head\r\nto the original position, he balanced a large piece of pumpkin-pie on\r\nthe point of his knife, and gallantly charged with it down his throat.\r\nPoor youth! a neighbour relieved his distress, and saved his ivories.\r\n\r\nNearly a quarter of an hour has elapsed; dinner is all over, the nuts\r\nare all cracked and put in the pockets, and away the company go either\r\nto the other end of the saloon, where the stove is placed, round which\r\nthey eat their nuts and smoke their cigars, or to drink at the bar. When\r\nthe smoking is over, clasp-knives are opened. Don't be alarmed; there is\r\nno bloodshed intended, although half a dozen people strolling about with\r\nthese weapons may appear ominous. Watch their faces; the lower part of\r\ntheir cheeks goes in with high-sucking pressure, then swells again, and\r\nthe active tongue sweeps with restless energy along and around the\r\nivory barriers within its range. In vain--in vain it strives to\r\ndispossess the intruders; rebellious particles of nut burrow deep\r\nbetween the ivories, like rabbits in an old stone dike. The knife comes\r\nto the rescue, and, plunging fearlessly into the dark abyss, the victory\r\nis won. Then the victors commence chewing _à l'outrance,_ and\r\nexpectorate on the red-hot stove, till it hisses like a steam-engine, or\r\nelse they deluge the floor until there is no alternative but thick shoes\r\nor damp feet. The fumes of every known alcohol exhale from the bar, and\r\nmix with the head-bursting fragrance of the strongest \"Warginny.\" Some\r\nseek safety in flight; others luxuriate in the poisonous atmosphere, and\r\nscream out, like deeply-injured men, if any door by chance be left open.\r\n\r\nBehold! the table is laid again for dinner; piles of food keep coming\r\nin; the company arrive--some in coats, some in waistcoats only; some in\r\ncoloured shirts, some in red flannel shirts; one, with sleeves turned up\r\nto the elbow. \"Who on earth are these?\" I ask, in my ignorance. \"Oh!\r\nthose, I guess, are the officers of the ship.\" Truly, they are \"free,\"\r\nbut whether \"enlightened\" also I had no opportunity of ascertaining. A\r\nshort ten minutes, and they are all scattered, and the piles of food\r\nwith them. Once more I look, and, behold! the table is again preparing.\r\nWho can this be for? Doubts are speedily solved, as a mixture of niggers\r\nand whites sit down to the festive hoard; it is the boys--_alias_\r\nwaiters--whose turn has come at last. Their meal over, the spare leaves\r\nof the table are removed, half a dozen square tables dot the centre line\r\nof the saloon, and all is comparatively quiet. This process takes place\r\nat every meal--8 A.M., 1 P.M., and 5 P.M.--with the most rigid\r\npunctuality.\r\n\r\nFancy my distress one evening, when, on opening my cabin-door, I beheld\r\na fellow-creature doubled up at the entry of the door opposite. I\r\nthought the poor sufferer had a fit of cholera, and I was expecting each\r\ninstant to hear his screams; but hearing nothing, I examined the person\r\nin question more minutely. It was merely a gentleman, who had\r\ndispossessed himself of his jacket, waistcoat, trousers, and boots, not\r\nforgetting his stockings; and then deliberately planting his chair in\r\nthe open entry of the door, and gathering up one foot on the seat\r\nthereof, was amusing himself by cutting and picking the horny\r\nexcrescences of his pedal digits, for the benefit of the passengers in\r\nthe gentlemen's saloon; and, unfortunately, you could not be sure that\r\nhis hands would be washed before he sat next to you at breakfast in the\r\nmorning,--for I can testify that I have, over and over again, sat next\r\nto people, on these Western waters, whose hands were scarce fit to take\r\ncoals out of a scuttle.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing I have here set down but what actually passed under my\r\nown eye. You will, of course, find gentlemen on board, and many whose\r\nmanners there is nothing to complain of, and whose conversation is both\r\ninstructive and amusing; but you evidently are liable to find others to\r\nrealize the picture I have given of scenes in the gentlemen's saloon,\r\nand, unless you have some acquaintance among the ladies, their saloon is\r\nas sacred from a gentleman as the Sultan's harem. And whence comes all\r\nthis, except from that famous bugbear \"equality?\" Is there any real\r\ngentleman throughout the Empire State who would, in his heart, approve\r\nof this ridiculous hustling together of well-bred and ill-bred? But it\r\npleases the masses, and they must submit to this incongruous herding and\r\nfeeding, like the hungry dogs of a \"Dotheboys Hall\" kennel.\r\n\r\nIt may be useful information for the traveller, and is only fair to the\r\nMississippi boat proprietors, to observe, that if you succeed in getting\r\na passage in a perfectly new boat, there is always more care, more\r\nsafety, better living, and better company. In all the boats there is one\r\nbrush and comb for the use of the passengers.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of steam and stream, we at last reached Cairo, which is on\r\nthe southern bank of the Ohio and the eastern of the Mississippi; its\r\nadvantageous position has not passed unnoticed, but much money has been\r\nthrown away upon it, owing to the company's not sitting down and\r\ncounting the cost before they began. There can be no question that,\r\ngeographically, it is _par excellence_ the site for the largest inland\r\ntown of America, situated as it is at the confluence of the two giant\r\narteries; and not merely is its position so excellent but mountains of\r\ncoal are in its neighbourhood. The difficulty which has to be contended\r\nagainst is the inundation of these rivers. Former speculators built up\r\nlevees; but either from want of pluck or purse, they were inefficiently\r\nconstructed; the Mississippi overflowed them and overwhelmed the\r\nspeculators. Latterly, however, another company has taken the task in\r\nhand, and having sufficient capital, it embraces the coal mines as well\r\nas the site, &c., of the new town, to which the coal will of course be\r\nbrought by rail, and thus be enabled to supply the steamers on both\r\nrivers at the cheapest rate, and considerably less than one-third the\r\nprice of wood; and if the indefatigable Swede's calorie-engine should\r\never become practicable, every steamer will easily carry sufficient coal\r\nfrom Cairo to last till her return; in short, I think it requires no\r\nprophetic eye to foresee that Cairo in fifty years, if the Union\r\ncontinues, will be one of the greatest, most important, and most\r\nflourishing inland towns in America; and curiously enough, this effect\r\nwill be essentially brought about by the British capital embarked in the\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nA few hours' run up the river brought us to St. Louis, whose nose, I\r\nprophesy, is to be put out of joint by Cairo some future day.\r\nNevertheless, what a wonderful place is this same St. Louis; its rapid\r\nincrease is almost as extraordinary as that of Cincinnati, and perhaps\r\nmore so, when you consider, not only that it is further west by hundreds\r\nof miles, but that it has to contend with the overflowing of the\r\nMississippi, which has, on more than one occasion, risen to the first\r\nfloor of the houses and stores built on the edge of the levee;\r\nfortunately, the greater part of the town, being built on higher ground,\r\nescapes the ruinous periodical duckings. It is situated seven hundred\r\nand fifty miles below the falls of St. Anthony, and twelve hundred miles\r\nabove New Orleans.\r\n\r\nLe Clede and his party appreciated the value of its position as early as\r\n1764, and named it in honour of Louis the Fifteenth. Subsequently it was\r\ntransferred to the Spaniards, in 1768: however, it made but little\r\nprogress until it passed into the hands of the United States, in 1804.\r\nThe energy of the American character soon changed the face of affairs,\r\nand there are now 3000 steam-boats arriving annually, which I believe to\r\nbe a greater number than there were inhabitants at the date of its\r\ncession to them. But the more active impulse seems to have commenced in\r\n1830, at which time the population was under 7000, since which date it\r\nhas so rapidly increased, that in 1852 its population was bordering on\r\n100,000. The natives of the United States form about one-half of the\r\ncommunity, and those of Germany one-fourth; the remainder are chiefly\r\nIrish. There are twenty newspapers, of which four are published in\r\nGerman. There are forty churches, one-fourth of which are Roman\r\nCatholic, and a liberal provision is made for education; the material\r\nprosperity of this thriving community is evidenced by the fact, that the\r\nannual value of the produce of their manufacturing-establishments\r\nexceeds 3,000,000l.; flour-mills, sugar refineries, and carpenters,\r\ncontributing more largely than other occupations; after which come the\r\ntailors, thanks probably to the Germans, who appear to have a strong\r\npredilection for this trade, at which there are more hands employed than\r\nat any other.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote M: Messrs. Wallis and Whitworth, in their Report on the\r\nIndustry of the United States, remark at Chapter V.--\"In no branch of\r\nmanufacture does the application of labour-saving machinery produce, by\r\nsimple means, more important results than in the working of wood.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote N: Since my return to England, I have seen it asserted, by a\r\ncorrespondent in the _Morning Chronicle_, that Colonel Crogan, of\r\nLouisville, purchased this cave for 2000l., and that, shortly after,\r\nhe was offered 20,000l. for his bargain. It is further stated that,\r\nin his will, he tied it up in his family for two generations. If this\r\nlatter be true, it proves that entails are not quite unknown even in the\r\nDemocratic Republic.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote O: I have heard, since my return to England, that old Mr. Bell\r\nis dead.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n_River Scenes_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI felt very anxious to make an excursion from St. Louis, and get a\r\nlittle shooting, either to the north-west or down near Cairo, where\r\nthere are deer; but my companion was dying to get to New Orleans, and\r\nstrongly urged me not to delay, \"fiddling after sport.\" I always looked\r\nupon myself as a model of good-natured easiness, ever ready to sacrifice\r\nself for a friend; but I have been told by some intimates, that such is\r\nnot my character, and some have even said, \"You're a obstinate follow.\"\r\nIf they were wrong, I suffered enough for my easiness; if they were\r\nright, I must have yielded the only time that I ought to have been firm;\r\nat all events, I gave up my shooting expedition, which I had intended to\r\noccupy the time with till a first-class boat started for New Orleans;\r\nand, in an evil hour, I allowed myself to be inveigled on board the\r\n\"Western World.\" The steam was up, and we were soon bowling down the\r\nleviathan artery of the North American continent. Why the said artery\r\nshould keep the name of the Mississippi, I cannot explain; for, not only\r\nis the Missouri the larger river above the confluence, but the\r\nMississippi is a clear stream, with solid, and, in some instances,\r\ngranite-bound shores, and perfectly free from \"snags;\" whereas the\r\nMissouri has muddy banks, and revels in snags, which, as many have sadly\r\nexperienced, is the case with the stream on which they are borne\r\nthroughout its whole length, thereby fully evincing its true parentage,\r\nand painfully exhibiting its just right to be termed Missouri; but the\r\nrights of men and women are difficult enough to settle, without entering\r\ninto the rights of rivers, although from them, as from men and women,\r\nflow both good and evil. A truce to rights, then, especially in this\r\n\"Far West,\" where every one is obliged to maintain his own for himself.\r\n\r\nThis river is one of the places assigned as the scene of the\r\nconversation between the philosopher and the boatman--a tale so old,\r\nthat it had probably died out before some of my younger readers were\r\nborn; I therefore insert it for their benefit exclusively.--A\r\nphilosopher, having arrived at a ferry, entered a boat, rowed by one of\r\nthose rare articles in this enlightened Republic--a man without any\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHER _(loquitur)._--Can you write?\r\n\r\nBOATMAN.--I guess I can't.\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHER.--How sad! why, you've lost one-third of your life! Of\r\ncourse you can read?\r\n\r\nBOATMAN,--Well, I guess I can't that neither.\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHER.--Good gracious me! why, you've lost two-thirds of your\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWhen the conversation had proceeded thus far, the boatman discovered\r\nthat, in listening to his learned passenger, he had neglected that\r\nvigilance which the danger of the river rendered indispensable. The\r\nstream was hurrying them into a most frightful snag; escape was\r\nhopeless; so the boatman opened the conversation with this startling\r\nquestion:\r\n\r\nBOATMAN.--Can you swim, sir?\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHER.--No, that I can't.\r\n\r\nBOATMAN.--Then, I guess, you've lost all your life.\r\n\r\nEre the sentence was finished, the boat upset; the sturdy rower\r\nstruggled manfully, and reached the shore in safety. On looking round,\r\nnought was to be seen of the philosopher save his hat, floating down to\r\nNew Orleans. The boatman sat down on the bank, reflecting on the fate of\r\nthe philosopher; and, as the beaver disappeared in the bend of the\r\nriver, he rose up and gave vent to his reflections in the following\r\nterms: \"I guess that gentleman was never taught much of the useful;\r\nlearning is a good thing in its place, but I guess swimming is the thing\r\non the Mississippi, fix it how you will.\"\r\n\r\nAs I have alluded to that _rara avis_ in the United States, a totally\r\nuneducated man, I may as well give an amusing specimen of the production\r\nof another Western, whose studies were evidently in their infancy. It is\r\na certificate of marriage, and runs thus:--\r\n\r\n  \"State of Illenois Peoria County ss\r\n\r\n  \"To all the world Greeting. Know ye that John Smith and Peggy Myres is\r\n  hereby certified to go together and do as old folks does, anywhere\r\n  inside coperas precinct, and when my commission comes I am to marry em\r\n  good, and date em back to _kivver accidents_.\r\n\r\n  \"O---- M---- R---- [ss]\r\n\r\n  \"Justice of the Peace.\"\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the \"Western World.\"\r\n\r\nHaving committed the indiscretion of taking my passage on board of her,\r\nthe next step I took--i.e., paying for it--was worse, and proclaimed\r\nme a griffin. The old stagers know these waters too well to think of\r\npaying before they are at, or about, the end of their journey. Having,\r\nhowever, both taken and paid for my passage, and committed what old\r\nmaids and sailors would call the audacious folly of starting upon a\r\nFriday, I may as well give you a description of the boat.\r\n\r\nThe river at many places and in many seasons being very low, these\r\nsteamers are built as light as possible; in short, I believe they are\r\nbuilt as light as any company can be found to insure them. Above the\r\nnatural load-line they flam out like the rim of a washing-basin, so as\r\nto give breadth for the superstructure; on the deck is placed the engine\r\nand appurtenances, fuel, &c.; whatever is not so occupied is for\r\nfreight. This deck is open all round, and has pillars placed at\r\nconvenient distances, about fifteen to twenty feet high, to support the\r\ncabin deck. The cabin deck is occupied in the centre by a saloon,\r\nextending nearly the whole length of the vessel, with sleeping\r\ncabins--two beds in each--opening off it on both sides. The saloon is\r\nentered from forward; about one-third of its length at the after-end is\r\nshut off by doors, forming the ladies' sanctum, which is provided with\r\nsofas, arm-chairs, piano, &c.; about one-fifth of the length at the\r\nforemost-end, but not separated in any way, is the smoking-place, with\r\nthe bar quite handy, and the stove in the centre. The floor of this\r\nplace may with propriety be termed the great expectorating deposit,\r\nowing to the inducements it offers for centralization, though, of\r\ncourse, no creek or cranny of the vessel is free from this American\r\ntobacco-tax--if I may presume so to dignify and designate it. Having\r\nthus taken off one-third and one-fifth, the remaining portion is the\r\n\"gentlemen's share\"--how many 'eenths it may be, I leave to fractional\r\ncalculators. Their average size is about sixteen feet broad, and from\r\nseven and a half to eight and a half feet high; the centre part is\r\nfurther raised about eighteen inches, having glass along the sides\r\nthereof, to give light; they are always well painted and elaborately\r\ngilt--in some vessels, such as the \"Eclipse,\" of Louisville, they are\r\nquite gorgeous. The cabins are about six feet by seven, the same height\r\nas the saloon, and lit by a door on the outside part, the upper portion\r\nof which is glass, protected, if required, by folding _jalousies_,\r\nintended chiefly for summer use. Outside these cabins a gallery runs\r\nround, covered at the top, and about four feet broad, and with entries\r\nto the main cabin on each side. The box which covers the paddle-wheel,\r\n&c., helps to make a break in this gallery, separating the gentlemen\r\nfrom the ladies.\r\n\r\nSome boats have a narrow passage connecting the two galleries, but\r\nfitted with a _grille_ door, to prevent intrusion into the harem\r\ngallery; before, the paddle-box, on one side, is the steward's pantry,\r\nand on the other, that indispensable luxury to an American, the barber's\r\nshop; where, at all hours of the day, the free and enlightened, mounted\r\non throne-like chairs and lofty footstools, stretch their carcases at\r\nfull length, to enjoy the tweaking of their noses and the scraping of\r\ntheir chins, by the artistic nigger who officiates. This distinguished\r\nofficial is also the solo dispenser of the luxury of oysters, upon which\r\nfish the Anglo-Saxon in this hemisphere is intensely ravenous. It looks\r\nfunny enough to a stranger, to see a notice hung up (generally near the\r\nbar), \"Oysters to be had in the barber's saloon.\" Everything is saloon\r\nin America. Above this saloon deck, and its auxiliaries of barber-shop,\r\ngallery, &c., is the hurricane-deck, whereon is a small collection of\r\ncabins for the captain, pilots, &c.--there are always two of the latter,\r\nand their pay each, the captain told me, is forty pounds a month--and\r\ntowering above these cabins is the wheel-house, lit all round by large\r\nwindows, whence all orders to the engineers are readily transmitted by\r\nthe sound of a good bell. The remainder of the deck--which is, in\r\nfact, only the roof of the saloon-cabins and gallery--is open to all\r\nthose who feel disposed to admire distant views under the soothing\r\ninfluence of an eternal shower of wood-cinders and soot. These vessels\r\nvary in breadth from thirty-five to fifty feet, and from one hundred and\r\nfifty to--the \"Eclipse\"--three hundred and sixty-five feet in length;\r\nthe saloons extending the whole length, except about thirty feet at each\r\nend. They have obtained the name of \"palace-steamers,\" and at a _coup\r\nd'oeil_ they appear to deserve it, for they are grand and imposing, both\r\noutside and inside; but many an European who has travelled in them will\r\nagree with me in the assertion, that they might, with more propriety, be\r\ntermed \"palace sepulchres;\" not merely from the loss of life to which\r\ntheir constant disasters give rise, but also from the contrast between\r\nthe grandeur outside and the uncleanliness within, of which latter I\r\nhave already given a sketch in my trip from Louisville.\r\n\r\nSome idea may be formed of their solidity, when I tell you they are only\r\ncalculated to last five years; but at the end of three, it is generally\r\nadmitted that they have paid for themselves, with good interest. I give\r\nyou this, on the information derived from a captain who was sole owner,\r\nand I have also heard many others repeat the same thing; and yet the\r\n\"Eclipse\" cost 120,000 dollars, or about 25,000l. In the saloon you\r\nwill always see an account of the goodness of the hull and the soundness\r\nof the boilers hung up, and duly attested by the proper inspectors of\r\nthe same. The way these duties of the inspectors are performed makes it\r\na perfect farce, at least on most occasions.\r\n\r\nThe inspector comes on board; the captain and engineer see him, and, of\r\ncourse, they shake hands, for here everybody shakes hands with everybody\r\nthe moment they meet, if only for the first time; the only variation\r\nbeing in the words addressed: if for the first time, it may run\r\nthus:--\"Sir, I'm happy to make your acquaintance;\" which may be replied\r\nto by an additional squeeze, and perhaps a \"Sir, I reciprocate.\"\r\nN.B.--Hats off always the first time. If it is a previous acquaintance,\r\nthen a \"Glad to see you, sir,\" is sufficient.--But to return from this\r\ndigression. The captain and engineer greet the inspector--\"I s'pose\r\nyou're come to look at our bilers, sir?\" \"Yes, sir, I am.\" The parties\r\nall instinctively drawing nearer and nearer to the bar. \"Well, sir,\r\nlet's have a drink.\"--\"Well, sir, let's.\"--\"A cigar, sir?\"--\"Thank'ee,\r\nsir!\" Parties smoke and drink. Ingeniously enough, the required document\r\nand pen and ink are all lying handy: the obdurate heart of the inspector\r\nis quite melted by kindness. \"Well, sir, I s'pose your bilers are all\r\nright?\"--\"I guess they are that, sir, and nurthin else; you can't go and\r\nfor to bust them bilers of mine, fix it anyhow you will; you can't that,\r\nI do assure you, sir.\"--What inspector can doubt such clear\r\nevidence.--\"Take another glass, sir, do.\"--\"Thank'ee, I'll sign this\r\npaper first.\" The inspection is over, all except the \"glass\" and the\r\n\"'bacco,\" which continue to flow and fume. The skippers of these boats\r\nare rough enough; but I always found them very civil, plain spoken, and\r\nready to give all the information in their power; and many of them have\r\nconfessed to me that the inspection was but too often conducted in the\r\nmanner above described.\r\n\r\nThere is little to interest in the account of a trip down the river. The\r\nstyle of society met with on board these vessels, I have already given\r\nyou a sketch of; it may sometimes be better, and sometimes worse. One of\r\nmy \"messmates\" in this boat, was a young fellow who had been second\r\ncaptain of the mizen-top on board of H.M.S. \"Vengeance;\" but not liking\r\nthe style of discipline, especially--as he said--the irritating\r\nsubstitutes for flogging which have been introduced of late years into\r\nthe Navy, to suit the mawkish sensibility of public opinion in England,\r\nas well as the clamours of the all-ruling Press, he took the first\r\nopportunity of running away, to seek his fortune in the Far West. He\r\nobserved to me one day, \"Those chaps who kick up such a devil of a row\r\nabout flogging in the Navy, whatever their intentions may be, are no\r\nreal friends to the sailor or the service.\"\r\n\r\nAs a slight illustration of the truth of his remarks, I may here observe\r\nthat a purser in the American Navy, in which service they have lately\r\nabolished flogging, told me, that soon after the paying off of a\r\nline-of-battle ship in which he had been serving, he happened to meet\r\nfifty of his old shipmates in the port, and asking them what they were\r\ngoing to do, they told him they were about to embark for England, to\r\ntake service in the English Navy; for said they, \"Since corporal\r\npunishment has been abolished, the good men have to do all the work, and\r\nthat wont pay.\" Only three of the fifty had ever been in the English\r\nservice. There can be no doubt that many gentlemen of sensitive minds,\r\nseeing the names of their brother officers dragged before the public,\r\nthrough the House of Commons or the columns of an anonymous Press,\r\nendeavour to keep up discipline by other means, which annoy Jack far\r\nmore, or else, slackening the bonds of discipline, leave all the work to\r\nbe done by the willing and the good; anything, rather than be branded as\r\na tyrant in every quarter of the globe by an anonymous assailant,\r\nknowing full well that, however explicit a denial may be inserted, ten\r\npeople will read the charge for every one that reads its contradiction.\r\nBut I am wandering from my young friend, the captain of the mizen-top.\r\n\r\nIf he did not look very well \"got up\" in his red shirt, at all events he\r\nwas clean in his person, thus forming a pleasing contrast to a young\r\nchap who came in the evening, and seated himself on the table, where I\r\nwas playing a game at écarté with my companion. His hands absolutely\r\nappeared the hands of a nigger, though his voice was the voice of a\r\nwhite; travelling my eyes up to and beyond his face, I found it was all\r\nin keeping; his hair looked like an Indian jungle. If some one could\r\nonly have caught him by the heels, and swung him round and round on a\r\ncarding machine, like a handful of hemp, it would have improved him\r\nimmensely; especially if, after going through that process, he had been\r\npassed between two of the pigs through the scalding-trough at\r\nCincinnati. Among others of our fellow-voyagers, we found one or two\r\nvery agreeable and intelligent American gentlemen, who, though more\r\naccustomed to the _désagréments_ of travel, were fully alive to it, and\r\nexpressed their disgust in the freest manner.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn from company to scenery.--What is there to be said on\r\nthis latter subject? Truly it is nought but sameness on a gigantic\r\nscale. What there is of grand is all in the imagination, or rather the\r\nreflection, that you are on the bosom of the largest artery of commerce\r\nin the world. What meets the eye is an average breadth of from half a\r\nmile to a mile of muddy water, tenanted by uprooted trees, and bristling\r\nwith formidable snags. On either side a continuous forest confines the\r\nview, thus depriving the scene of that solemn grandeur which the\r\nhorizonless desert or the boundless main is calculated to inspire. The\r\nsigns of human life, like angels' visits, are few and far between. No\r\nbeast is seen in the forest, no bird in the air, except from time to\r\ntime a flight of water-fowl. At times the eye is gratified by a\r\nconvocation of wild swans, geese, and ducks, assembled in conclave upon\r\nthe edge of some bank; or, if perchance at sunrise or sunset you happen\r\nto come to some broad bend of the river, the gorgeous rays light up its\r\nsurface till it appears a lake of liquid fire, rendered brighter by the\r\nsurrounding darkness of the dense and leafless forest. Occasionally the\r\ntrumpet-toned pipe of the engine--fit music for the woods--bursts forth;\r\nbut there are no mountains or valleys to echo its strains far and wide.\r\nThe grenadier ranks of vegetable life, standing like sentries along the\r\nmargin of the stream, refuse it either an entry or an answer, and the\r\nrude voice of mechanism finds a speedy and certain sepulture in the\r\nmuddy banks. This savage refusal of Nature to hold converse is\r\noccasionally relieved by the sight of a log hut, surrounded with cords\r\nof wood[P] prepared for sale to the steamers. At other times a few\r\nstraggling huts, and piles of goods ready for transport, vary the scene.\r\nSometimes you come to a real village, and there you generally find an\r\nold steamer doing duty for wharf-boat and hotel, in case of passengers\r\nlanding at unseasonable hours of the night. Thanks also to the great\r\ncommercial activity of the larger towns above, the monotony of the river\r\nis occasionally relieved by the sight of steam-boats, barges,\r\ncoal-boats, salt-boats, &c. Now and then one's heart is cheered and\r\none's spirits fortified by the sight of a vessel or two that has been\r\nsnagged, and which the indignant stream appears to have left there as a\r\ngentle hint for travellers.\r\n\r\nThus the day passes on, and, when night closes in, you bid adieu to your\r\nfriends, not with \"Pleasant dreams to you!\" but with a kind of\r\nmysterious smile, and a \"I hope we sha'n't be snagged to-night!\" You\r\nthen retire to your cabin, and ... what you do there depends on\r\nyourself; but a man whose mind is not sobered when travelling on these\r\nwaters is not to be envied.\r\n\r\nWhen you leave your cabin in the morning, as you enter the saloon, you\r\nfancy a cask of spirits has burst. A little observation will show you\r\nyour mistake, and the cause of it; which is merely that the free and\r\nenlightened are taking their morning drink at the bar. Truly they are a\r\nwonderful race; or, as they themselves sometimes express it, \"We are a\r\ntall nation, sir; a big people.\" Though they drink on all occasions,\r\nwhether from sociability or self-indulgence, and at all times, from rosy\r\nmorn to dewy eve, and long after;--though breath and clothes are \"alive\"\r\nwith the odour of alcohol, you will scarcely ever see a passenger drunk.\r\nCards are also going all day long, and there is generally a\r\nFancy-man--or blackleg--ready to oblige a friend. These card-playings\r\nare conducted quietly enough at present; but an old traveller told me he\r\nremembered, some fifteen years ago, when things were very different, and\r\nwhen every player came armed with a pistol and bowie-knife, by which all\r\nlittle difficulties as to an odd trick or a bet were speedily settled on\r\nthe spot. In those days the sun never rose and set without witnessing\r\none or more of these exciting little adjustments of difficulties, with\r\nwhich the bystanders were too good judges ever to interfere. In fact,\r\nthey seem to have been considered as merely pleasing little breaks in\r\nthe monotony of the trip.\r\n\r\nAs it may interest some of _my_ readers, I will endeavour to retail for\r\ntheir amusement a sketch which was given me of a scene of boat-racing in\r\nthe olden time. The \"Screecher\" was a vessel belonging to Louisville,\r\nhaving a cargo of wild Kentuckians and other passengers on board, among\r\nwhom was an old lady, who, having bought a winter stock of bacon, pork,\r\n&c., was returning to her home on the banks of the Mississippi. The\r\n\"Burster\" was a St. Louis boat, having on board a lot of wild\r\nback-woodsmen, &c. The two rivals met at the confluence of the Ohio and\r\nthe Mississippi. Beat or burst was the alternative. Victory hung in one\r\nscale; in the other, defeat and death. The \"Screecher\" was a little\r\nahead; gradually the \"Burster\" closes. The silence of a death-struggle\r\nprevails. The Screechers put on more wood, and place more weight on the\r\nsafety-valve; she bounds ahead. Slowly, but surely, the \"Burster\" draws\r\nnearer. The captain of the \"Screecher\" looks wistfully at the fires, for\r\nthe boilers are well-nigh worn out. The \"Burster\" is almost abreast. The\r\nenraged Kentuckians gather round the captain, and, in fury, ask--\"Why\r\ndon't you put more weight on?\"\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN--\"Boilers are done; can't bear it nohow.\"\r\n\r\nKENTUCKIANS--\"Can't bear it? You chicken-hearted coward--\"\r\n\r\nKnives are drawn, pistols click, a hundred voices exclaim, \"Get on it\r\nyourself, or I'll bury this knife below your outer skin.\" Their eyes\r\ngleam--their hands are raised for the deadly blow. Wild boys, these\r\nKentuckians; the captain knows it too well. A choice of deaths is before\r\nhim; excitement decides--he mounts the breach. The \"Screecher\" shoots\r\nthrough the waters, quivering from head to stern. The Kentucky boys yell\r\nwith delight and defiance. Again the \"Burster\" closes on her rival.\r\nKentuckians brandish their knives, and call to the negroes, who are\r\nalready half-roasted, \"Pile on the wood; pile like agony; I'll ram a\r\nnigger into the fire for every foot the 'Burster' gains.\" Soon a cry of\r\nexultation is heard on board the \"Burster,\" as she shoots up close to\r\nher rival. The enraged Kentuckians shout out, \"Oil, I swear!--oil, by\r\nall creation!\" \"I smell it!\" exclaims the old lady with the store of\r\nbacon. Her eyes flash fire; a few words to her slaves Pompey and Caesar,\r\nand casks of bacon, smashed quick as thought, lay before the furnace. In\r\nit all goes; the \"Screecher\" is wild; the captain bounds up and down\r\nlike a parched pea on a filing-pan; once more she flies ahead of her\r\nrival \"like a streak of greased lightning.\" Suddenly--horror of\r\nhorrors!--the river throbs beneath; the forest trees quake like aspen\r\nleaves; the voice of many thunders rends the air; clouds of splinters\r\nand human limbs darken the sky. The \"Burster\" is blown to atoms! The\r\ncaptain jumps down, and joins the wild Kentucky boys in a yell of\r\nvictory, through the bass notes of which may be heard the shrill voice\r\nof the old lady, crying, \"I did it, I did it--it's all my bacon!\"\r\n\r\nThe struggle over, and the excitement passed, they return and pick up\r\nsuch portions of the human frame as may be found worth preserving.--To\r\nresume.\r\n\r\nOur captain was overtaken by a telegraphic message, requiring his\r\nappearance on a certain day to answer a charge of libel. From what I\r\ncould glean, it seems that the captain, considering himself cheated by a\r\nperson with whom he had been transacting business, took the liberty of\r\nsaying to him, \"Well, you're a darned infernal rascal, fix it anyhow you\r\nwill!\" The insulted person sued for 2500 dollars damages, and the\r\ncaptain was obliged to leave us, that he might go and defend his cause.\r\nHe was a good type of a \"hard-a-weather-bird,\" and I was sorry to see\r\nhim obliged to quit the ship. I told him so, adding, that if he deserted\r\nus, we should be sure to get snagged, or something worse. He\r\nreplied,--\"Oh, no, sir; I guess you'll be safe enough; I shall leave my\r\nclerk in charge; he's been a captain of these boats; you'll be right\r\nenough, sir.\" And away he went ashore at Memphis, leaving us to continue\r\nour course to New Orleans.\r\n\r\nNight came on, and we all toddled off to roost. I am habitually a very\r\nsound sleeper, dropping off the moment I turn in, and never awaking till\r\ndaylight. On this occasion, however, I awoke about two o'clock A.M.,\r\nand, do what I would, I could not coax myself to sleep again. While\r\ntossing from side to side, I felt the vessel strike as if gently\r\ntouching a bank; and wood being a good conductor of sound, I heard the\r\nwater, as it were, gurgling in. My first idea was, \"We are snagged;\"\r\nthen, remembering how slight the concussion had been, I calmed my fears\r\nand turned over on my side, determined to bottle off a little more sleep\r\nif possible. Scarce had the thought crossed the threshold of my mind,\r\nwhen men with hasty steps rushed into the saloon, banging frantically at\r\nthe cabin-doors, and the piercing cry was heard--\"Turn out! turn\r\nout!--we're sinking!\" Passengers flew from their beds, and opened their\r\ndoors to get what scanty light the lamps in the saloon might afford. A\r\nmysterious and solemn silence prevailed; all was action; no time for\r\nwords; dress, catch up what you can, and bolt for your life. As I got to\r\nthe side of the vessel, I saw a steamer alongside, and felt the boat I\r\nwas in careening over. A neighbour, in fear and desperation, caught hold\r\nof me as a drowning man catches at a straw; no time for compliments\r\nthis, when it is neck or nothing; so, by a right-hander in the pit of\r\nthe stomach, I got quit of his clutch, and, throwing my desk over to the\r\nother boat, I grasped the wooden fender and slid down. Thank God, I was\r\nsafe!--my companion was already safe also.\r\n\r\nIt was about half-past four A.M., a drizzly, wet morning, quite dark,\r\nexcept the flame of the torches. A plank was got on board of the sinking\r\nboat, along which more passengers and even some luggage were saved. The\r\ncrew of the sound boat had hard work to keep people from trying to\r\nreturn and save their luggage, thus risking not only their own lives but\r\nat the same time impeding the escape of others. From the gallery above\r\nI was looking down upon the wreck, lit up by the lurid light of some\r\ndozen torches, when, with a crash like thunder, she went clean over and\r\nbroke into a thousand pieces; eighty head of cattle, fastened by the\r\nhorns, vainly struggled to escape a watery grave. It was indeed a\r\nterrific and awful scene to witness. From the first striking till she\r\nwent to pieces, not a quarter of an hour had elapsed; but who was saved?\r\nWho knew, and--alas! that I must add--who cared?\r\n\r\nThe crew worked hard enough to rescue all, and to them be every credit\r\nfor their exertions; but the indifference exhibited by those who had\r\nbeen snatched from the jaws of death was absolutely appalling. The\r\nmoment they escaped, they found their way to the bar and the stove, and\r\nthere they were smoking, drinking, and passing the ribald jest, even\r\nbefore the wreck had gone to pieces, or the fate of one-half of their\r\ncompanions been ascertained. Yet there was a scene before their eyes\r\nsufficient, one would have imagined, to have softened the hardest heart\r\nand made the most thoughtless think. There, among them, at the very\r\nstove round which they were gathered, stood one with a haggard eye and\r\nvacant gaze, and at his feet clung two half-naked infants; a quarter of\r\nan hour before he was a hale man, a husband, with five children; now, he\r\nwas an idiot and a widower, with two. No tear dimmed his eye, no trace\r\nof grief was to be read in his countenance; though the two pledges of\r\nthe love of one now no more hung helplessly round his legs, he heeded\r\nthem not; they sought a father's smile--they found an idiot's stare.\r\nThey cried: was it for their mother's embrace, or did they miss their\r\nbrother and sisters? Not even the piteous cry of motherless infancy\r\ncould light one spark of emotion in the widowed husband's breast--all\r\nwas one awful blank of idiocy. A wife and three children, buried beneath\r\npiles of freight, had found a wretched grave; his heart and his reason\r\nhad fled after them--never, apparently, to return.\r\n\r\nSurely this was a scene pre-eminently calculated to excite in those who\r\nwore, by their very escape, living monuments of God's mercy, the deepest\r\nfeelings of gratitude and commiseration; yet, there stood the poor\r\nidiot, as if he had not been; and the jest, the glass, and cigar went on\r\nwith as much indifference as if the party had just come out of a\r\ntheatre, instead of having providentially escaped from a struggle\r\nbetween life and death. A more perfect exhibition of heartlessness\r\ncannot be conceived, nor do I believe any other part of the world could\r\nproduce its equal.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause of the wreck was the steamer \"H.R.W. Hill\" running\r\ninto us, owing to misunderstanding the bell signal; most providentially\r\nshe caught alongside of us after striking; if she had not done so, God\r\nalone knows who could have been saved. As far as I could ascertain, all\r\nthe first-class passengers were saved. Do not stare at the word\r\nfirst-class, for although in this country of so-called equality no\r\ndifference of classes is acknowledged, poor helpless emigrants are taken\r\nas deck-passengers, and, as freight is the great object, no space is set\r\napart for them; they are stowed away among the cargo as best they can\r\nbe, with no avenue of escape in case of accidents, and with the\r\nadditional prospect of being buried beneath bales and barrels. I believe\r\nfifteen passengers perished in this way: one poor English-woman among\r\nthe deck-passengers fought her way through the freight, and, after being\r\nnearly drowned and trampled to death under the hoofs of the cattle,\r\nsucceeded in escaping. A slave-merchant with a dozen negroes managed to\r\nsave all of them, inasmuch as, being valuable, he had them stowed away\r\nin a better place. The moment the wreck was completed, we proceeded up\r\nthe river, wasting no time in trying to save any part of the cargo or\r\nluggage. My own position was anything but a pleasant one, though I trust\r\nI was truly thankful for my preservation. I found I had managed to throw\r\nmy desk between the two steamers, and it was therefore irrecoverably\r\nlost, with all my papers, letters of credit, journal, &c. I had also\r\nlost everything else except what T had on,--rifle, guns, clothes,--all\r\nwere gone. A few things, such as money, watch, note-book, which I always\r\nkept in my pockets, were all my stock in trade. Fortunately, my friend\r\nhad saved his papers, and thus our identity could be established at New\r\nOrleans. In the course of a few hours we saw a fine steamer coming down\r\nthe river, in which we embarked, and again pursued our journey south.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we passed several pieces of the wreck: the shores were\r\ncovered with the casks of pork and mustang liniment which had formed a\r\ngreat part of our freight. At one place, a large portion of the wreck,\r\nwas made fast ashore, and being plundered by the settlers on the bank;\r\nboxes and trunks were all broken open and cleaned out; little boats were\r\nflying across the river full of pork and other prizes: it was an\r\nuniversal scramble in all directions, and appeared to be considered as\r\nlawful plunder by them as if they had been Cornish wreckers. It was\r\nhopeless to try and recover anything, so we continued our journey, and\r\nleft our goods to the tender mercies of the landsharks on the banks.\r\nHaving lost all my papers, I was obliged to forego the pleasure I had\r\nanticipated from a visit to Natchez, or rather to the gentlemen and\r\nplantations in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nAs you approach the lower part of the river, signs of human life become\r\nmore frequent; the forest recedes, the banks of the river are leveed up,\r\nand legions of Uncle Tom's Cabins stud the banks; some, clustered near\r\nthe more luxurious but still simple building wherein dwells the\r\nproprietor, surrounded by orange groves and the rich flowers and foliage\r\nof southern climes. These little spots appear like bright oases in the\r\notherwise dreary, uninteresting flats, which extend from the banks on\r\neither side; yet it is only as a scene they are uninteresting; as a\r\nreality, they have a peculiar interest. On these Hats the negro slave\r\nexpends his labour and closes his life, and from the bitter of his\r\ncareer the white man draws the sweet luxury of his own. How few reflect\r\nupon this, even for as many seconds as it takes to melt the clarified\r\nlump in the smoking bohea. But here we are at La Fayette, which is the\r\nupper or American end of New Orleans, where steamers always stop if\r\nthere are any cattle on board, which being our case, we preferred\r\nlanding and taking an omnibus, to waiting for the discharge of the\r\nlive-stock. Half an hour brought us to the St. Louis Hotel, and there\r\nyou may sit down a minute or two while I make some observations on the\r\nsteaming in Western rivers.\r\n\r\nThe whole system and management is a most grievous reproach to the\r\nAmerican nation. I speak not of the architecture, which is good, nor of\r\nthe absurd inconsistency in uniting such palatial appearance with such\r\nabsolute discomfort, which perhaps, with their institutions and ideas,\r\nit would be very difficult to remedy. My observations refer more to\r\nthat by which human life is endangered, and the valuable produce of\r\nhuman labour recklessly destroyed. The following extract from a\r\nLouisville paper will more than justify any animadversions which I may\r\nmake:--\r\n\r\n  DISASTERS ON WESTERN RIVERS.--The Louisville _Courier_ has published a\r\n  list of disasters on Western waters during the year 1852. It is a\r\n  formidable one, embracing 78 steam-boats, 4 barges, 73 coal-boats, 3\r\n  salt-boats, and 4 others, flat-boats. It appears that 47 boats were\r\n  lost by being snagged, 16 by explosions, 4 were burnt, and the others\r\n  lost by collision and other mishaps. The greatest number of lives lost\r\n  by one disaster was the explosion of the \"Saluda,\" 100. The total loss\r\n  of life exceeds 400 persons.[Q]\r\n\r\nHere is a list of one hundred and sixty-two vessels of different kinds,\r\nand four hundred human beings, lost in one year; of which vessels it\r\nappears forty-six were snagged. You will naturally ask here, what\r\nprecautions are taken to avoid such frightful casualties? The answer is\r\nshort--None. They had a few boats employed once to raise the snags, but\r\nthe thirst for annexation ran them into a war, and the money was wanted\r\nfor that purpose. The Westerns say they are ridden over by the Easterns,\r\nand that Government will do nothing for them.[R]\r\n\r\nIt is not for me to decide the reasons, but the fact is but too clear,\r\nthat in a country boasting of its wealth, its power, its resources, and\r\nnot burdened with one farthing of debt, not a cent is being expended in\r\nmaking the slightest endeavours to remove the dangers of this gigantic\r\nartery of commerce. And what would be the cost of this national object?\r\nThe captains of the boats told me that two dozen snag-boats in three\r\nyears would clear the river; and that half that number could keep it\r\nclear; yet, rather than vote the money requisite, they exhibit a\r\nnational indifference to the safety of life and property such as, I may\r\nconfidently affirm, cannot be found in any other civilized nation. A\r\nvery small tax on the steamers would pay the expenses; but the Westerns\r\nsay, and say with truth, \"This is not a local, this is a national question.\r\nGovernment builds lighthouses, harbours, &c., for the eastern board, and\r\nwe are entitled to the same care for our commerce.\" A navigation of two\r\nthousand miles is most certainly as thoroughly a national question as a\r\nseaboard is. It should also be remembered that, if the navigable\r\ntributaries be added, the total presents an unbroken highway of internal\r\ncommerce amounting to 16,700 miles--a distance which, it has been\r\nremarked, \"is sufficient to encircle Europe and leave a remnant which\r\nwould span the Atlantic.\"\r\n\r\nNext on the list comes the \"explosions.\" I have already given you an\r\naccount of how the so-called examinations are too often made. Surely\r\nthese inspections might be signed upon oath before a magistrate; and as\r\nsurely, I should hope, men might be found who would not perjure\r\nthemselves. The burnt vessels are few in number, and more than one case\r\nhas, I believe, been tried on suspicion of being set fire to\r\nintentionally.\r\n\r\nThe last on the list is \"collisions, &c.\" By the \"&c.,\" I suppose, is\r\nmount vessels which, having run on the river till they wore only fit for\r\nfirewood, still continued \"just one more trip;\" and then, of course, the\r\nslightest concussion, either on a bank or a floating log, would break\r\nthem up like a chip basket. The examination on this point is conducted\r\nlike that of the boilers, and the same remedy might readily be applied.\r\nI think, however, that the greater number of losses from collisions,\r\n&c., may be chiefly ascribed to the collisions. The cause of these\r\ncollisions is easily understood, when you are informed that vessels\r\nmeeting indicate the side they intend to take by sounding a bell. They\r\nhave no fixed rule, like vessels meeting at sea. The sound of the toll\r\nof the second bell may easily be blended with the first, if it be struck\r\nhurriedly, which in cases of danger is more than probable; or, the sound\r\nof a single toll may find an echo and be mistaken for two tolls. The\r\ncollision we met with was caused by this very misunderstanding; at\r\nleast, so the captains mutually explained it. The reason given me for\r\nthis unsettled system was, that, owing to banks and currents, vessels\r\ncould not always take the same side. Supposing this to be so, still, a\r\nmore correct indication of the side intended to be taken might be\r\nobtained by lights kept burning for that purpose in a box with a\r\nsliding front, removeable at pleasure by a line leading to the\r\nwheel-house, in the same way as the lanyard of the bell is at present\r\nfitted; and a further palpable advantage would be obtained by obliging\r\nvessels meeting in the night to stop the engines and pass at \"slow\r\nspeed.\" In addition to these precautions, a stout cork fender, extending\r\nround the bows some ten feet on each side, and fixed every night at\r\ndark, would materially lessen the chances of destruction, even if\r\ncollision did take place.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another cause of accident which the Louisville paper\r\ndoes not allude to, and that is overloading. We started about two and a\r\nhalf feet out of the water when leaving St. Louis, and, long before we\r\nmet with our accident, we had taken in cargo till we were scarce five\r\ninches above the river. Not only do they cram the lower or freight deck,\r\nbut the gallery outside the saloons and cabins is filled till all the\r\nuse and comfort thereof is destroyed, and scarce a passage along them to\r\nbe obtained. Seeing the accidents such reckless freighting must\r\nnecessarily give rise to, what more simple than obliging every vessel to\r\nhave a float or loading line painted from stem to stern at a certain\r\nelevation, making the captain and owners liable to a heavy penalty if\r\nthe said line be brought below the water by the freight. There is one\r\nother point which I may as well notice here, and that is the manner in\r\nwhich these boats are allowed to carry deck-passengers. There is no\r\nclear portion of deck for them, and they are driven by necessity among\r\nthe bales and boxes of freight, with no avenue of escape in case of\r\naccident. These are the people who suffer in cases of snagging and\r\ncollision, &c. These hardy sons of toil, migrating with their families,\r\nare all but penniless, and therefore, despite all vaunt of equality,\r\nthey are friendless. Had every deck-passenger that has perished in the\r\nagony of a crushing and drowning death been a Member of Senate or\r\nCongress, the Government would have interfered long ere this; but these\r\nmiserable wretches perish in their agony, and there is no one to re-echo\r\nthat cry in the halls of Congress. They are chiefly poor emigrants, and\r\nplenty more will come to fill their places.\r\n\r\nIf the Government took any such steps as those above recommended, the\r\nfear of losing insurance by neglecting them would tend greatly to make\r\nthem respected. Companies would insure at a lower rate, and all parties\r\nwould be gainers in the long run; for, if the Government obtained no\r\npecuniary profit, it would gain in national character by the removal of\r\na reproach such as no other commercial country at the present day\r\nlabours under.\r\n\r\nThere is, moreover, a moral point of view to be taken of this\r\nquestion--viz., \"the recklessness of human life engendered by things as\r\nthey are.\"\r\n\r\nThe anecdotes which one hears are of themselves sufficient to leave\r\nlittle doubt on this point. Take, for instance, the following:--A vessel\r\nhaving been blown up during the high pressure of a race, among the\r\nwitnesses called was one who thus replied to the questions put to him:--\r\n\r\nEXAMINER.--\"Were you on board when the accident took place?\"\r\n\r\nWITNESS.--\"I guess I was, and nurthing else.\"\r\n\r\nEXAMINER.--\"Was the captain sober?\"\r\n\r\nWITNESS.--\"Can't tell that, nohow.\"\r\n\r\nEXAMINER.--\"Did you not see the captain during the day?\"\r\n\r\nWITNESS.--\"I guess I did.\"\r\n\r\nEXAMINER.--\"Then can, you not state your opinion whether he was drunk or\r\nnot?\"\r\n\r\nWITNESS.--\"I guess I had not much time for observation; he was not on\r\nboard when I saw him.\"\r\n\r\nEXAMINER.--\"When did you see him, then?\"\r\n\r\nWITNESS.--\"As I was coming down, I passed the gentleman going up.\"\r\n\r\nThe court, of course, was highly amused at his coolness, and called\r\nanother witness.--But let us turn from this fictitious anecdote to fact.\r\n\r\nIt was only the other day that I read in a Louisville paper of a\r\ngentleman going into the Gait-house Hotel, and deliberately shooting at\r\nanother in the dining-saloon when full of people, missing his aim, and\r\nthe hall lodging in the back of a stranger's chair who was quietly\r\nsitting at his dinner. Again, I read of an occurrence--at Memphis, I\r\nthink--equally outrageous. A man hard pressed by creditors, who had\r\nassembled at his house and were urgent in their demands, called to them\r\nto keep back, and upon their still pressing on, he seized a bowie-knife\r\nin each hand, and rushed among them, stabbing and ripping right and\r\nleft, till checked in his mad career of assassination by a creditor, in\r\nself-defence, burying a cleaver in his skull.\r\n\r\nIn a Natchez paper I read as follows:--\"Levi Tarver, formerly a resident\r\nof Atala county, was recently killed in Texas. Tarver interrupted a\r\ngentleman on the highway; high words ensued, when Tarver gave the\r\ngentleman the lie; whereupon the latter drew a bowie-knife, and\r\ncompletely severed, at one blow, Levi's head from his body.\"\r\n\r\nIn a St. Louis paper, I read of a German, Hoffman by name, who was\r\nsupposed by Baker to be too intimate with his wife, and who was\r\nconsequently desired to discontinue his visits. Hoffman remonstrated in\r\nhis reply, assuring the husband that his suspicions were groundless. A\r\nshort time after he received a letter from Mrs. Baker, requesting him to\r\ncall upon her: he obeyed the summons, and was shown into her bedroom at\r\nthe hotel. The moment he got there, Mrs. Baker pulled two pistols from\r\nunder the pillow, and discharged both at his head. Hoffman rushed out of\r\nthe house; scarce was he in the street, when Mr. Baker and three other\r\nruffians pounced upon him, dragged him back to the hotel, and placed\r\nguards at the door to prevent any further ingress from the street. They\r\nthen stripped him perfectly naked, lashed him with cow-hides till there\r\nwas scarce a sound piece of flesh in his body, dashing cold water over\r\nhim at intervals, and then recommencing their barbarities. When tired of\r\nthis brutality, they emasculated their wretched victim with a common\r\ntable-knife. And who were these ruffians? Were they uneducated villains,\r\nwhom poverty and distress had hardened into crime? Far from it. Mr.\r\nBaker was the owner of a grocery store; of the others, one was the\r\nproprietor of the St. Charles hotel, New Bremen; the second was a young\r\nlawyer, the third was a clerk in the \"Planter's House.\" Can the sinks of\r\nignorance and vice in any community present a more bloody scene of\r\nbrutality than was here deliberately enacted, by educated people in\r\nrespectable positions, in the middle of the day? What can be thought of\r\nthe value of human life, when I add that all these miscreants were\r\nbailed?\r\n\r\nThese are merely the accounts which have met my eye in the natural\r\ncourse of reading the newspaper, for I can most truthfully declare I\r\nhave not taken the slightest trouble to hunt them up. The following,\r\nwhich bears upon the same point, was related to me in the course of\r\nconversation at dinner, and it occurred in New Orleans. Mr. A. treads on\r\nMr. B.'s too several times; Mr. B. kicks Mr. A. down stairs, and this at\r\na respectable evening party. Now what does Mr. A. do? He goes outside\r\nand borrows a bowie-knife from a hack-cabman, then returns to the party,\r\nwatches and follows Mr. B. to the room where the hats and cloaks were\r\nplaced, seizes a favourable moment, and rips Mr. B.'s bowels open. He is\r\ntried for murder, with evidence sufficient to hang a dozen men; and, to\r\nthe astonishment of even the Westerns themselves, he is acquitted. These\r\nfacts occurred not many years since, and they were narrated to me by a\r\ngentleman who was at the party.\r\n\r\nWhen two members of the Legislature disgraced the halls at Washington,\r\nby descending into the political arena with pistols and bowie-knives,\r\nand there entering into deadly conflict, were they not two Western\r\nmembers? Now, what do these occurrences prove? Certainly not that all\r\nWesterns are bloodthirsty, for many of them are the most kind, quiet,\r\nand amiable men I have ever met; but, when taken in connexion with the\r\nfree use of the bowie-knife, they afford strong evidence that there is a\r\ngeneral and extraordinary recklessness of human life; and surely, common\r\nsense and experience would both endorse the assertion, that habituating\r\nmen to bloody disputes or fatal accidents has a tendency to harden both\r\nactors and spectators into utter indifference. And what is the whole of\r\nthe Western river navigation but one daily--I might almost say,\r\ncontinual--scene of accidents and loss of life, tending to nourish those\r\nvery feelings which it is the duty of every government to use all\r\npossible means to allay and humanize?\r\n\r\nThe heartless apathy with which all classes of society, with scarce\r\nindividual exceptions, speak of these events is quite revolting to a\r\nstranger, and a manifest proof of the injurious moral effect of\r\nfamiliarizing people with such horrors. The bowie-knife, the revolver,\r\nand the river accidents, mutually act and react upon each other, and no\r\nmoral improvement can reasonably be expected until some great change be\r\neffected. Government can interfere with the accidents;--deadly weapons\r\nare, to a certain extent, still necessary for self-protection. Let us\r\nhope, then, that something will ore long be done to prevent disasters\r\npregnant with so many evils to the community, and reflecting so strongly\r\non the United States as a nation.[S] Having gone off at a tangent, like\r\na boomerang, I had better, like the same weapon, return whence I\r\nstarted--in military language, \"as you was.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote P: On the Mississippi a cord contains one definite quantity,\r\nbeing a pile 1 feet high, 4 feet broad, and 8 feet long, and does not\r\nvary in size in the same absurd manner as it does in various parts of\r\nEngland: the price paid is from eight to thirteen shillings, increasing\r\nas you descend the river.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote Q: A committee of the United States calculated that, in 1846,\r\nthe losses on the Mississippi amounted to 500,000l.; and as commerce has\r\nincreased enormously, while precautions have remained all but stagnant,\r\nI think it may be fairly estimated, that the annual losses at the\r\npresent day amount to at least 750,000l.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote R: _Vide_ chapter on \"Watery Highways.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote S: Since writing the above, some more stringent regulations as\r\nto inspection have appeared, similar to those advocated in the text; but\r\nthey contain nothing respecting loading, steering, &c. In fact, they are\r\ngeneral laws, having 110 especial bearing on Western waters.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n_New Orleans_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Orleans is a surprising evidence of what men will endure, when\r\ncheered by the hopes of an ever-flowing tide of all-mighty dollars and\r\ncents. It is situated on a marsh, and bounded by the river on one side,\r\nand on the other by a continuation of the marsh on which it is built,\r\nbeyond which extends a forest swamp. All sewerage and drainage is\r\nsuperficial--more generally covered in, but in very many places dragging\r\nits sluggish stream, under the broad light of day, along the edges of\r\nthe footway. The chief business is, of course, in those streets skirting\r\nthe river; and at this season--December--when the cotton and sugar mania\r\nis at its height, the bustle and activity is marvellous. Streets are\r\npiled in every direction with mounds of cotton, which rise as high as\r\nthe roofs; storehouses are bursting with bales; steam and hydraulic\r\npresses hiss in your ear at every tenth step, and beneath their power\r\nthe downy fibre is compressed into a substance as hard as Aberdeen\r\ngranite, which semi-nude negroes bind, roll, and wheel in all\r\ndirections, the exertion keeping them in perpetual self-supplying animal\r\nsteam-baths. Gigantic mules arrive incessantly, dragging fresh freight\r\nfor pressure; while others as incessantly depart, bearing freight for\r\nembarkation to Europe. If a pair of cotton socks could be made vocal,\r\nwhat a tale of sorrow and labour their history would reveal, from the\r\nnigger who picked with a sigh to the maiden who donned with a smile.\r\n\r\nSome idea may be formed of the extent of this branch of trade, from the\r\nstatistical fact that last year the export amounted to 1,435,815\r\nbales[T]--or, in round numbers, one and a half millions--which was an\r\nincrease of half a million upon the exports of the preceding twelve\r\nmonths. Tobacco is also an article of great export, and amounted last\r\nyear to 94,000 hogsheads, being an increase of two-thirds upon the\r\nprevious twelve months. The great staple produce of the neighbourhood is\r\nsugar and molasses. In good years, fifty gallons of molasses go to a\r\nthousand pounds of sugar; but, when the maturity of the cane is impeded\r\nby late rains, as was the case last year, seventy gallons go to the\r\nthousand pounds of sugar. Thus, in 1853, 10,500,000 gallons of molasses\r\nwere produced, representing 210,000,000 pounds of sugar; while, in 1854,\r\n18,300,000 gallons of molasses were produced, being nearly double the\r\nproduce of the preceding year, but representing only 261,500,000 pounds\r\nof sugar,--owing, as before explained, to the wet weather. Some general\r\nidea of the commercial activity of New Orleans may be formed from the\r\nfollowing statistics for 1853:--2266 vessels, representing 911,000 tons,\r\nentered New Orleans; and 2202 vessels, representing 930,000 tons,\r\ncleared.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, the greater portion--or I might almost say the whole--of\r\nthe goods exported reach New Orleans by the Mississippi, and therefore\r\njustify the assertion that the safe navigation of that river is, in the\r\nfullest sense of the term, a national and not a local interest, bearing\r\nas it does on its bosom an essential portion of the industrial produce\r\nof eleven different States of the Union.\r\n\r\nIt is quite astounding to see the legions of steamers from the upper\r\ncountry which are congregated here; for miles and miles the levee forms\r\none unbroken line of them, all lying with their noses on shore--no room\r\nfor broadsides. On arriving, piled up with goods mountain high, scarce\r\ndoes a bow touch the levee, when swarms of Irish and niggers rush down,\r\nand the mountainous pile is landed, and then dragged off by sturdy mules\r\nto its destination. Scarce is she cleared, when the same hardy sons of\r\ntoil build another mountainous pile on board; the bell rings, passengers\r\nrun, and she is facing the current and the dangers of the snaggy\r\nMississippi. The labour of loading and unloading steamers is, as you may\r\nsuppose, very severe, and is done for the most part by niggers and\r\nIrishmen. The average wages are from 7l. to 8l. per month; but, in\r\ntimes of great pressure from sudden demand, &c., they rise as high as\r\nfrom. 12l. to 14l. per month, which was the case just before my\r\narrival. The same wages are paid to those who embark in the steamers to\r\nload and unload at the different stations on the river. Every day is\r\na working day; and as, by the law, the slave has his Sunday to himself\r\nto earn what he can, the master who hires him out on the river is\r\nsupposed to give him one-seventh of the wages earned; but I believe they\r\nonly receive one-seventh of the ordinary wages--i.e., 1l. per month.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW ST. CHARLES HOTEL, NEW ORLEANS.]\r\n\r\nLet us now turn from the shipping to the town. In the old, or French\r\npart, the streets are generally very narrow; but in the American, or the\r\nLa Fayette quarter, they are very broad, and, whether from indolence or\r\nsome other reason, badly paved and worse cleansed; nevertheless, if the\r\nstreets are dirty and muddy, the houses have the advantage of being\r\nairy. There are no buildings of any importance except the new\r\nCustom-house, and, of course, the hotels. The St. Louis is at present\r\nthe largest; but the St. Charles, which is being rebuilt, was, and will\r\nagain be, the hotel pride of New Orleans.[U] They are both enormous\r\nestablishments, well arranged, and, with the locomotive propensities of\r\nthe people, sure to be well filled during the winter months, at which\r\nperiod only they are open. When I arrived at the St. Louis, it was so\r\nfull that the only room I could get was like a large Newfoundland dog's\r\nkennel, with but little light and less air. The hotel was originally\r\nbuilt for an Exchange, and the rotundo in the centre is one of the\r\nfinest pieces of architecture in the States. It is a lofty, vaulted\r\nhall, eighty feet in diameter, with an aisle running all round,\r\nsupported by a row of fine pillars fifty feet in height; the dome rises\r\nnearly as many-feet more, and has a large skylight in the centre; the\r\nsides thereof are ornamented by well-executed works in _chiaroscuro_,\r\nrepresenting various successful actions gained during the struggle for\r\nindependence, and several of the leading men who figured during that\r\neventful period. A great portion of the aisle is occupied by the\r\nall-important bar, where drinks flow as freely as the river outside; but\r\nthere is another feature in the aisles which contrasts strangely with\r\nthe pictorial ornaments round the dome above--a succession of platforms\r\nare to be seen, on which human flesh and blood is exposed to public\r\nauction, and the champions of the equal rights of man are thus made to\r\nendorse, as it were, the sale of their fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nI had only been in the hotel one day when a gentleman to whom I had a\r\nletter kindly offered me a room in his house. The offer was too\r\ntempting, so I left my kennel without delay, and in my new quarters\r\nfound every comfort and a hearty welcome, rendered more acceptable from\r\nthe agreeable society which it included, and the tender nursing I\r\nreceived at the hands of one of the young ladies during the week I was\r\nconfined to the house by illness. Among all the kind and hospitable\r\nfriends I met with in my travels, none have a stronger claim on my\r\ngrateful recollection than Mr. Egerton and his family. When able to get\r\nout, I took a drive with mine host: as you may easily imagine, there is\r\nnot much scenery to be found in a marsh bounded by a forest swamp, but\r\nthe effect is very curious; all the trees are covered with Spanish moss,\r\na long, dark, fibrous substance which hangs gracefully down from every\r\nbough and twig; it is often used for stuffing beds, pillows, &e. This\r\nmost solemn drapery gave the forest the appearance of a legion of mute\r\nmourners attending the funeral of some beloved patriarch, and one felt\r\ndisposed to admire the patience with which they stood, with their feet\r\nin the wet, their heads nodding to and fro as if distracted with grief,\r\nand their fibrous weeds quivering, as though convulsed with the\r\nintensity of agony. The open space around is a kind of convalescent\r\nmarsh; that is, canals and deep ditch drains have been opened all\r\nthrough it, and into these the waters of the marsh flow, as a token of\r\ngratitude for the delicate little attention; at the same time, the\r\nadjacent soil, freed from its liquid encumbrance, courts the attractive\r\ncharms of the sun, and has already risen from two and a half to three\r\nand a half feet above its marshy level.\r\n\r\nThe extremity of this open space furthest from the town has been\r\nappropriately fixed upon as the site of various cemeteries. The\r\nlugubrious forest is enough to give a man the blue devils, and the\r\nditches and drains into which the sewers, &c., of the town are pumped,\r\ndragging their sluggish and all but stagnant course under a broiling\r\nsummer gun, are sufficient to prepare most mortals for the calm repose\r\ntowards which the cypress and the cenotaph beckon them with greedy\r\nwelcome. The open space I have been describing is the \"Hyde Park\" and\r\n\"Rotten Row\" of New Orleans, and the drive round it is one of the best\r\nroads I ever travelled; it is called the \"Shell Road,\" from the\r\ntop-dressing thereof being entirely composed of small shells, which soon\r\nbind together and make it as smooth as a bowling-green. The Two-forty\r\ntrotters--when there are any--come out here in the afternoon, and show\r\noff their paces, and if you fail in finding any of that first flight, at\r\nall events you are pretty sure to see some good teams, that can hug the\r\nthree minutes very closely. Custom is second nature, and necessity is\r\nthe autocrat of autocrats, which even the free and enlightened must\r\nobey; the consequence is, that the inhabitants of New Orleans look\r\nforward to the Shell-road ride, or drive, with as much interest and\r\nsatisfaction as our metropolitan swells do to the Serpentine or the Row.\r\n\r\nHaving had our drive, let us now say a few words about the society. In\r\nthe first place, you will not see such grand houses as in New York; but\r\nat the same time it is to be observed, that the tenants here occupy and\r\nenjoy all their houses, while in New York, as I have before observed,\r\nthe owners of many of the finest residences live almost exclusively in\r\nthe basements thereof. This more social system at New Orleans, I am\r\ninclined to attribute essentially to the French--or Creole--habits with\r\nwhich society is leavened, and into which, it appears to me, the\r\nAmericans naturally and fortunately drop. On the other hand, the rivalry\r\nwhich too often taints a money-making community has found its way here.\r\nIf A. gives a party which costs 200l., B. will try and get up one at\r\n300l., and so on. This false pride--foolish enough anywhere--is more\r\nstriking in New Orleans, from the fact that the houses are not\r\ncalculated for such displays, and when they are attempted, it involves\r\nunfurnishing bed-rooms and upsetting the whole establishment. I should\r\nadd they are comparatively rare, perhaps as rare as those parties which\r\nare sometimes given in London at the expense of six weeks' fasting, in\r\norder that the donor's name and the swells who attended the festive\r\nscene may go forth to the world in the fashionable column of the\r\n_Morning Post_. Whenever they do occur, they are invariably attended\r\nwith some such observations as the following:--\r\n\r\n\"What did Mrs. B.'s party cost last night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not less than 300l.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm sure they have not the means to afford such extravagant\r\nexpense; and I suppose the bed-rooms upstairs were all cleared out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes! three of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well I know that house, and, fix it how you will, if they cleared out\r\nthree bed-rooms, I'm sure they must have slept on the sofas or the\r\ntables. I declare it's worse than foolish--it's wicked to have so much\r\npride,\" &c.\r\n\r\nIf those who thus indulged their vanity, only heard one-half of the\r\nobservations made by those who accent their hospitalities, or who strive\r\nto get invitations and cannot, they would speedily give up their folly;\r\nbut money is the great Juggernaut, at the feet of which all the nations\r\nof the earth fall down and worship; whether it be the coronets that\r\nbowed themselves down in the temple of the Railway King in Hyde Park,\r\nwho could afford the expense; or the free and enlightened who do homage\r\nin Mrs. ----'s temple at New Orleans, though perhaps she could not\r\nafford the expense; one thing is clear--where the money is spent, there\r\nwill the masses be gathered together. General society is, however, more\r\nsober and sociable, many families opening their houses one day in the\r\nweek to all their friends. The difference of caste is going out fast:\r\nthe Creoles found that their intermarriages were gradually introducing a\r\nrace as effete as the Bourbons appear to be in France; they are now\r\ntherefore very sensibly seeking alliances with the go-ahead blood of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon, which will gradually absorb them entirely, and I expect\r\nthat but little Trench will be spoken in New Orleans by the year 1900.\r\nAnother advantage of the Creole element, is the taste it appears to have\r\ngiven for French wines. As far as I am capable of judging, the claret,\r\nchampagne, and sauterne which I tasted here were superior in quality and\r\nmore generally in use than I ever found them in any other city. The\r\nhours of dinner vary from half-past three to half-past five, and an\r\nunostentatious hospitality usually prevails.\r\n\r\nServants here are expensive articles. In the hotels you find Irishmen\r\nalmost exclusively, and their wages vary from 2l. 8s. to 10l. per\r\nmonth. In private houses, women's wages range from 2l. 8s. to 4l.\r\nand men's from 6l. to 8l. the month. The residents who find it\r\ninconvenient to go to the north during the summer, cross the lake to\r\ntheir country villas at Passe Christianne, a pretty enough little place,\r\nfar cooler and more shady than the town, and where they get bathing, &c.\r\nA small steamer carries you across in a few hours; but competition is\r\nmuch wanted, for their charges are treble those of the boats in the\r\nnorth, and the accommodation poor in comparison.\r\n\r\nWhen crossing over in the steamer, I overheard a conversation which\r\nshowed how early in life savage ideas are imbibed here. Two lads, the\r\neldest about fifteen, had gone over from New Orleans to shoot ducks.\r\nThey were both very gentlemanly-looking boys, and evidently attending\r\nsome school. Their conversation of course turned upon fighting--when did\r\nschoolboys meet that it was not so? At last, the younger lad said--\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you think of Mike Maloney?\", \"Oh! Mike is very good with\r\nhis fists; but I can whip him right off at rough-and-tumble.\"\r\n\r\nNow, what is \"rough-and-tumble?\" It consists of clawing, scratching,\r\nkicking, hair-pulling, and every other atrocity, for which, I am happy\r\nto think, a boy at an English school would be well flogged by the\r\nmaster, and sent to Coventry by his companions. Yet, here was as nice a\r\nlooking lad as one could wish to see, evidently the son of well-to-do\r\nparents, glorying in this savage, and, as we should call it, cowardly\r\naccomplishment. I merely mention this to show how early the mind is\r\ntutored to feelings which doubtless help to pave the way for the\r\nbowie-knife in more mature years.\r\n\r\nThe theatres at New Orleans are neat and airy. Lola Montez succeeded in\r\ncreating a great _furore_, at last. I say \"at last,\" because, as there\r\nreally is nothing in her acting above mediocrity, she received no\r\nespecial encouragement at first, although she had chosen her own career\r\nin Bavaria as the subject in which to make her _débût._ She waited with\r\nconsiderable tact till she was approaching those scenes in which the mob\r\ntriumph over order; and then, pretending to discover a cabal in the\r\nmeagre applause she was receiving, she stopped in the middle of her\r\nacting, and, her eyes flashing fire, her face beaming brass, and her\r\nvoice wild with well-assumed indignation, she cried--\"I'm anxious to do\r\nmy best to please the company; but if this cabal continues, I must\r\nretire!\" The effect was electric. Thunders of applause followed, and\r\n\"Bravo, Lolly!\" resounded through the theatre, from the nigger-girl in\r\nthe upper gallery to the octogenarian in the pit. When the clamour had\r\nsubsided, some spicy attacks on kingcraft and the nobles followed most\r\nopportunely; the shouts were redoubled; her victory was complete. When\r\nthe piece was over, she came forward to assure the company that the\r\nscenes she had been enacting were all facts in which she had, in\r\nreality, played the same part she had been representing that evening.\r\nThunders of \"Go it, Lolly! you're a game 'un, and nurthin' else!\" rang\r\nall through the house as she retired, bowing. She did not appear in the\r\ncharacter of \"bowie-knifing a policeman at Berlin;\" and of course she\r\nomitted some scenes said to have taken place during interviews with the\r\nking, and in which her conduct might not have been considered, strictly\r\nspeaking, quite correct. She obtained further notoriety after my\r\ndeparture, by kicking and cuffing a prompter, and calling the proprietor\r\na d--d scoundrel, a d--d liar, and a d--d thief, for which she was\r\ncommitted for trial. I may as well mention here, that the theatre was\r\nwell attended by ladies. This fact must satisfy every unprejudiced mind\r\nhow utterly devoid of foundation is the rumour of the ladies of America\r\nputting the legs of their pianofortes in petticoats, that their\r\nsensitive delicacy may not receive too rude a shock. Besides the\r\ntheatres here, there is also an opera, the music of which, vocal and\r\ninstrumental, is very second-rate. Nevertheless, I think it is highly to\r\nthe credit of New Orleans that they support one at all, and sincerely do\r\nI wish them better success.\r\n\r\nThe town is liberally supplied with churches of all denominations. I\r\nwent one Sunday to a Presbyterian church, and was much struck on my\r\nentry at seeing all the congregation reading newspapers. Seating myself\r\nin my pew, I found a paper lying alongside of me, and, taking it up, I\r\ndiscovered it was a religious paper, full of anecdotes and experiences,\r\n&c., and was supplied _gratis_ to the congregation. There were much\r\nshorter prayers than in Scotland, more reading of the Bible, the same\r\namount of singing, but performed by a choir accompanied by an organ, the\r\ncongregation joining but little. The sermon was about the usual length\r\nof one in Scotland, lasting about an hour, and extemporized from notes.\r\nThe preacher was eloquent, and possessed of a strong voice, which he\r\ngave the reins to in a manner which would have captivated the wildest\r\nHighlander. The discourse delivered was in aid of foreign missions, and\r\nthe method he adopted in dealing with it was--first, powerfully to\r\nattack monarchical forms of government and priestly influence, by which\r\nsoft solder he seemed to win his way to their republican hearts; and\r\nfrom this position, he secondly set to work and fed their vanity freely,\r\nby glowing encomiums on their national deeds and greatness, and the\r\nsuperior perfections of their glorious constitution; whence he deduced,\r\nthirdly, that the Almighty had more especially committed to them the\r\ngreat work of evangelizing mankind. This discourse sounded like the\r\npolitical essay of an able enthusiast, and fell strangely on my ears\r\nfrom the lips of a Christian minister, whose province, I had always been\r\ntaught to consider, was rather to foster humility than to inflame\r\nvanity. It is to be presumed he knew his congregation well, and felt\r\nthat he was treading the surest road to their dollars and cents.\r\n\r\nAmong other curiosities in this town is a human one, known as the Golden\r\nMan, from the quantity of that metal with which he bedizens waistcoat,\r\nfingers, &c. During my stay at New Orleans, he appeared decked with such\r\nan astounding gem, that it called forth the following notice from the\r\npress:--\r\n\r\n  ANOTHER RING.--The \"gold\" individual who exhibits himself and any\r\n  quantity of golden ornaments, of Sunday mornings, in the vicinity of\r\n  the Verandah and City Hotels, will shortly appear with a new wonder\r\n  wherewith to astonish the natives. One would think that he had already\r\n  ornaments enough to satisfy any mortal; but he, it appears, is not of\r\n  the stuff every-day people are made of, and he could not rest\r\n  satisfied until his fingers boasted another ring. The new prodigy is,\r\n  like its predecessors, of pure solid gold. It is worth 500 dollars,\r\n  and weighs nearly, if not quite, a pound. This small treasure is\r\n  intended for the owner's \"little\" finger. It is the work of Mr. Melon,\r\n  jeweller and goldsmith, on Camp-street, and is adorned with small\r\n  carved figures, standing out in bold relief, and of very diminutive\r\n  size, yet distinct and expressive. The right outer surface represents\r\n  the flight of Joseph, the Virgin, and the infant Jesus into Egypt.\r\n  Joseph, bearing a palm-branch, leads the way, the Virgin follows,\r\n  seated on a donkey, and holding the Saviour in her lap. On the left\r\n  outer edge of the ring is seen the prophet Daniel, standing between\r\n  two lions. The prophet has not got a blue umbrella under his arm to\r\n  distinguish him from the lions. The face of the ring exhibits an\r\n  excellent design of the crucifixion, with the three crosses and the\r\n  Saviour and the two thieves suspended thereto. This ring is certainly\r\n  a curiosity.\r\n\r\nThere is a strong body of police here, and some of their powers are\r\nautocratically autocratic: thus, a person once committed as a vagrant is\r\nliable to be re-imprisoned by them if met in the street unemployed. Now,\r\nas it is impossible to expect that people in business will take the\r\ntrouble to hunt up vagrants, what can be conceived more cruelly\r\narbitrary than preventing them from hunting up places for themselves?\r\nYet such is the law in this democratic city.[V] A gentleman told me of a\r\nvagrant once coming to him and asking for employment, and, on his\r\ndeclining to employ him, begging to be allowed to lie concealed in his\r\nstore during the day, lest the police should re-imprison him before he\r\ncould get on board one of the steamers to take him up the river to try\r\nhis fortunes elsewhere. At the same time, a person in good circumstances\r\ngetting into difficulties can generally manage to buy his way out.\r\n\r\nThe authorities, on the return of Christmas, having come to the\r\nconclusion that the letting off of magazines of crackers in the streets\r\nby the juvenile population was a practice attended with much\r\ninconvenience and danger to those who were riding and driving, gave\r\norders that it should be discontinued. The order was complied with in\r\nsome places, but in others the youngsters set it at defiance. It will\r\nhardly be credited that, in a nation boasting of its intelligence and\r\nproud of its education, the press should take part with the youngsters,\r\nand censure the magistrates for their sensible orders. Yet such was the\r\ncase at New Orleans. The press abused the authorities for interfering\r\nwith the innocent amusements of the children, and expressed their\r\nsatisfaction at the latter having asserted their independence and\r\nsuccessfully defied the law. The same want of intelligence was exhibited\r\nby the press in censuring the authorities for discontinuing the\r\nprocessions on the anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans--\"a ceremony\r\ncalculated to excite the courage and patriotism of the people.\" They\r\nseem to lose sight of the fact, that it is a reflection on the courage\r\nof their countrymen to suppose that they require such processions to\r\nanimate their patriotism, and that the continuance of such public\r\ndemonstrations parading the streets betokens rather pride of past deeds\r\nthan confidence in their power to re-enact them. Although such\r\ndemonstrations may be readily excused, or even reasonably encouraged, in\r\nan infant community struggling for liberty, they are childish and\r\nundignified in a powerful nation. What would be more ridiculous than\r\nScotland having grand processions on the anniversary of Bannockburn, or\r\nEngland on that of Waterloo? Moreover, in a political point of view, it\r\nshould not be lost sight of, that if such demonstrations have any effect\r\nat all on the community, it must be that of reviving hostile feelings\r\ntowards those to whom they are united most closely by the ties of blood,\r\nsense, and--though last, not least--cents. I merely mention these\r\ntrivial things to show the punyizing effects which the democratic\r\nelement has on the press.\r\n\r\nFormerly, duels were as innumerable here as bales of cotton; they have\r\nconsiderably decreased latterly, one cause of which has been, the State\r\nof Louisiana passing a law by which any person engaging in a duel is at\r\nonce deprived of his vote, and disabled from holding any state\r\nemployment. John Bull may profit by this hint.\r\n\r\nI was much amused, during my stay at New Orleans, by hearing the remarks\r\nof the natives upon the anti-slavery meeting at Stafford House, of which\r\nthe papers were then full. If the poor duchess and her lady allies had\r\nbeen fiends, there could scarcely have been more indignation at her\r\n\"presumptuous interference\" and \"mock humility.\" Her \"sisters, indeed!\r\nas if she would not be too proud to stretch out her hand to any one of\r\nthem,\" &c. Then another would break out with, \"I should like to know by\r\nwhat right she presumes to interfere with us and offer advice? If she\r\nwants to do good, she has opportunities enough of exercising her charity\r\nin London. Let any one read _The Times_, and then visit a plantation\r\nhere, and say whether the negroes are not happier and better off than\r\none-half of the lower classes in England,\" &c. If every animadversion\r\nwhich the duchess and her colleagues' kind intentions and inoffensive\r\nwording of them called forth in America had been a pebble, and if they\r\nhad all been gathered together, the monument of old Cheops at Ghizeh\r\nwould have sunk into insignificance when contrasted with the gigantic\r\nmass; in short, no one unacquainted with the sensitiveness of the\r\nAmerican character can form a conception of the violent state of\r\nindignation which followed the perusal of the proceedings of that small\r\nconclave of English lady philanthropists. Mrs. Jones, Smith, Adams, and\r\nBrown might have had their meeting on the same subject without producing\r\nmuch excitement; but when the aristocratic element was introduced, it\r\nacted as a spark in a barrel of gunpowder. As an illustration of the\r\nexcitement produced, I subjoin an extract from one of their daily\r\npapers, under the heading of \"Mrs. Stowe in Great Britain:\"--\r\n\r\n  \"The principles of free government developed here, and urging our\r\n  people on with unexampled rapidity in the career of wealth and\r\n  greatness, have always been subjects of alarm to monarchs and\r\n  aristocracies--of pleasure and hope to the people. It has, of course,\r\n  been the object of the former to blacken us in every conceivable way,\r\n  and to make us detestable in the eyes of the world. There has been\r\n  nothing since the revolution so well calculated to advance this end,\r\n  as the exhibition which Mrs. Stowe is making in England.\r\n\r\n  \"It is because they have a deep and abiding hostility to this country,\r\n  and to republicanism in general, that the aristocracy, not only of\r\n  England, but of all Europe, have seized with so much avidity upon\r\n  _Uncle Tom_, and have been at so much pains to procure a triumphal\r\n  march for its author through all the regions she may choose to visit.\r\n  They are delighted to see a native of the United States--of that\r\n  republic which has taught that a people can flourish without an\r\n  aristocracy or a monarch--of that republic, the example of whose\r\n  prosperity was gradually undermining thrones and digging a pit for\r\n  privileged classes--describing her country as the worst, the most\r\n  abandoned, the most detestable that ever existed. Royalty draws a long\r\n  breath, and privilege recovers from its fears. Among the people of the\r\n  continent, especially among the Germans, Italians, and Russians, there\r\n  are thousands who believe that murder is but a pastime here--that the\r\n  bowie-knife and pistol are used upon any provocation--that, in fact,\r\n  we are a nation of assassins, without law, without morality, and\r\n  without religion. They are taught to believe these things by their\r\n  newspapers, which, published under the eye of Government, allow no\r\n  intelligence but of murders, bowie-knife fights, &c., coming from\r\n  America, to appear in their columns. By these, therefore, only is\r\n  America known to their readers; and they are very careful to instil\r\n  the belief, that if America is a land of murderers, it is so because\r\n  it has had the folly to establish a republican form of government.\r\n\r\n  \"These ideas are very general in England, even where the hostility is\r\n  greater than it is on the Continent. To British avarice we owe slavery\r\n  in this country. To British hatred we owe the encouragement of\r\n  anti-slavery agitation now. The vile hypocrisy which has\r\n  characterised the whole proceeding is not the least objectionable part\r\n  of it. The English care not one farthing about slavery. If they did,\r\n  why do they keep it up in such a terrific form in their own country?\r\n  Where was there ever true charity that did not begin at home? It is\r\n  because there is a deep-rooted hostility to this country pervading the\r\n  whole British mind, that these things have taken place.\"\r\n\r\nThe wounded sensitiveness, however, which the foregoing paragraph\r\nexhibits, found some consolation from an article which appeared in _The\r\nTimes_. They poured over its lines with intense delight, soothing\r\nthemselves with each animadversion it made upon the meeting, and\r\ndeducing from the whole--though how, I could never understand--that they\r\nhad found in the columns of that journal a powerful advocate for\r\nslavery. Thus was peace restored within their indignant breasts, and\r\nperhaps a war with the ladies of the British aristocracy averted. Of two\r\nfacts, however, I feel perfectly certain; one is, that the\r\nanimadversions made in America will not in the least degree impair her\r\nGrace's healthy condition; and the other is, that the meeting held at\r\nStafford House will in no way improve the condition of the negro.\r\n\r\nThere are two or three clubs established here, into one of which\r\nstrangers are admitted as visitors, but the one which is considered the\r\n\"first chop\" does not admit strangers, except by regular ballot; one\r\nreason, I believe, for their objecting to strangers, is the immense\r\nnumber of them, and the quality of the article. Their ideas of an\r\nEnglish gentleman, if formed from the mass of English they see in this\r\ncity, must be sufficiently small: there is a preponderating portion of\r\nthe \"cotton bagman,\" many of whom seek to make themselves important by\r\ntalking large. Although probably more than nine out of ten never have\r\n\"thrown their leg\" over anything except a bale of cotton, since the\r\ninnocent days of the rocking-horse, they try to impress Jonathan by\r\npulling up their shirt-collar consequentially, and informing him,--\"When\r\nI was in England, I was used to 'unt with the Dook's 'ounds; first-rate,\r\nsir, first-rate style--no 'ats, all 'unting-caps.\" Then, passing his\r\nleft thumb down one side of his cheek, his fingers making a parallel\r\ncourse down the opposite cheek, with an important air and an expression\r\nindicative of great intimacy, he would condescendingly add,--\"The Dook\r\nwasn't a bad chap, after all: he used to give me a capital weed now and\r\nthen.\" With this style of John Bull in numerical ascendency, you cannot\r\nwonder at the club-doors not being freely opened to \"the Dook's\r\nfriends,\" or at the character of an English gentleman being imperfectly\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nTime hurries on, a passport must be obtained, and that done, it must be\r\n_viséd_ before the Spanish consul, as Cuba is my destination. The\r\nFilibusteros seem to have frightened this functionary out of his\r\nproprieties. A Spaniard is proverbially proud and courteous--the present\r\nspecimen was neither; perhaps the reason may have been that I was an\r\nEnglishman, and that the English consul had done all his work for him\r\n_gratis_ when the Filibustero rows obliged him to fly. Kindness is a\r\nthing which the Spaniards as a nation find it very difficult to forgive.\r\nHowever, I got his signature, which was far more valuable than his\r\ncourtesy; most of his countrymen would have given me both, but the one\r\nsufficed on the present occasion. Portmanteaus are packed--my time is\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nAdieu, New Orleans!--adieu, kind host and amiable family, and a thousand\r\nthanks for the happy days I spent under your roof. Adieu, all ye\r\nhospitable friends, not forgetting my worthy countryman the British\r\nconsul. The ocean teapot is hissing, the bell rings, friends cry, kiss,\r\nand smoke--handkerchiefs flutter in the breeze, a few parting gifts are\r\nthrown on board by friends who arrive just too late; one big-whiskered\r\nfellow with bushy moustache picks up the parting _cadeau_--gracious me!\r\nhe opens it, and discloses a paper bag of lollipops; another unfolds a\r\nprecious roll of chewing tobacco. Verily, extremes do meet. The\r\n\"Cherokee\" is off, and I'm aboard. Down we go, sugar plantations\r\nstudding either shore; those past, flat dreary banks succeed; ships of\r\nall nations are coming up and going down by the aid of tugboats; two\r\nlarge vessels look unpleasantly \"fixed\"--they are John Bull and\r\nJonathan, brothers in misfortune and both on a bank.\r\n\r\n\"I guess the pilots will make a good thing out of that job!\" says my\r\nneighbour.--\r\n\r\n\"Pilots!\" I exclaimed, \"how can that be? I should think they stood a\r\nfair chance of losing their licence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! sir, we don't fix things that way here; the pilots are too 'cute,\r\nsir.\" Upon inquiry, I found that, as the banks were continually\r\nshifting, it was, as my friend said, very difficult \"to fix the\r\npilots,\"--a fact which these worthies take every advantage of, for the\r\npurpose of driving a most profitable trade in the following manner.\r\nPilot goes to tug and says, \"What do you charge for getting a ship off?\"\r\nThe price understood, a division of the spoil is easily agreed upon.\r\nAway goes the pilot, runs the ship on shore on the freshest sandbank,\r\ncurses the Mississippi and everything else in creation; a tug comes up\r\nvery opportunely, a tidy bargain is concluded; the unfortunate pilot\r\nforfeits 100l., his pilotage from the ship, and consoles himself the\r\nfollowing evening by pocketing 500l. from the tugman as his share of the\r\nspoil, and then starts off again in search of another victim. Such, I\r\nwas informed by practical people, is a common feature in the pilotage of\r\nthese waters, and such it appears likely to continue.\r\n\r\nThe \"Cherokee\" is one of those vessels which belong to Mr. Law, of whom\r\nI could get no information, expect that he had sprung up like a mushroom\r\nto wealth and Filibustero notoriety. He is also the custodian, I\r\nbelieve, of the three hundred thousand stand of arms ordered by Kossuth\r\nfor the purpose of \"whipping\" Russia and Austria, and establishing the\r\nRepublic of Hungary, unless by accident he found brains enough to become\r\na Hungarian Louis Napoleon; but Mr. Law's other vessel, called the\r\n\"Crescent City,\" and the Cuban Black Douglas, yclept \"Purser Smith,\" are\r\nperhaps better known. Peradventure, you imagine this latter to be a wild\r\nhyena-looking man, with radiant red hair, fiery ferret eyes, and his\r\npockets swelled out with revolutionary documents for the benefit of the\r\ndiscontented Cubans; but I can inform you, on the best authority, such\r\nis not the case, for he was purser of the \"Cherokee\" this voyage. He\r\nlooks neither wild nor rabid, and is a grey-headed man, about fifty\r\nyears of age, with a dash of the Israelite in his appearance: he may or\r\nhe may not have Filibustero predilections--I did not presume to make\r\ninquiry on the subject. And here I cannot but remark upon the childish\r\nconduct of the parties concerned in the ridiculous \"Crescent City and\r\nCuba question,\" although, having taken the view they did, the Spaniards\r\nwere of course perfectly right in maintaining it. It was unworthy of\r\nthe Spanish nation to take notice of the arrival of so uninfluential a\r\nperson as Purser Smith; and it was imprudent, inasmuch as it made him a\r\nperson of importance, and gave the party with whom he was supposed to be\r\nconnected a peg to hang grievances upon, and thus added to their\r\nstrength. It was equally unworthy of Mr. Law, when objection was made,\r\nand a notification sent that Mr. Smith would not be admitted nor the\r\nvessel that carried him, to persist in a course of conduct obnoxious to\r\na friendly power; and it was imprudent, when it must have been obvious\r\nthat he could not carry his point; thereby eventually adding strength to\r\nthe Spanish authority. When, all the fuss and vapour was made by Mr. Law\r\nand his friends, they seemed to have forgotten the old adage, \"People\r\nwho live in glass houses should not throw stones.\" President Filmore, in\r\nhis statesmanlike observations, when the subject was brought before him,\r\ncould not help delicately alluding to Charleston, a city of America.\r\nAmericans at Charleston claim to exercise the right--what a prostitution\r\nof the term right!--of imprisoning any of the free subjects of another\r\nnation who may enter their ports, if they are men of colour. Thus, if a\r\ncaptain arrives in a ship with twenty men, of whom ten are black, he is\r\ninstantly robbed of half his crew during his whole stay in the harbour;\r\nand on what plea is this done? Is any previous offence charged against\r\nthem? None whatever. The only plea is that it is a municipal regulation\r\nwhich their slave population renders indispensable. In other words, it\r\nis done lest the sacred truth should spread, that man has no right to\r\nbind his fellow-man in the fetters of slavery.[W]\r\n\r\nWas there ever such a farce as for a nation that tolerates such a\r\nmunicipal regulation as this to take umbrage at any of their citizens\r\nbeing, on strong suspicions of unfriendly feeling, denied entry into any\r\nport? Why, if there was a Chartist riot in monarchical England, and the\r\nports thereof were closed against the sailors of republican America,\r\nthey could have no just cause of offence, so long as the present\r\nmunicipal law of Charleston exists. What lawful boast of freedom can\r\nthere ever be, where contact with freemen is dreaded, be their skins\r\nblack or any colour of the rainbow? Why can England offer an asylum to\r\nthe turbulent and unfortunate of all countries and climes?--Because she\r\nis perfectly free! Don't be angry, my dear Anglo-Saxon brother; you\r\nknow, \"if what I say bayn't true, there's no snakes in Warginny.\" I feel\r\nsure you regret it; but then why call forth the observations, by\r\nsupporting the childish obstinacy in the \"Crescent City\" affair.\r\nHowever, as the housemaids say, in making up quarrels, \"Let bygones be\r\nbygones.\" Spain has maintained her rights; you have satisfied her, and\r\nquiet Mr. Smith enters the Havana periodically, without disturbing the\r\nGovernor's sleep or exciting the hopes of the malcontents. May we never\r\nsee the Great Empire States in such an undignified position again!\r\n\r\nHere we are still in the \"Cherokee;\" she is calculated to hold some\r\nhundreds of passengers. Thank God! there are only some sixty on board;\r\nbut I do not feel equally grateful for their allowing me to pay double\r\nprice for a cabin to myself when two-thirds of them are empty, not to\r\nmention that the single fare is eight guineas. She is a regular old tub\r\nof a boat; the cabins are profitably fitted with three beds in each, one\r\nabove the other; the consequence is, that if you wish to sneeze at\r\nnight, you must turn on your side, or you'll break your nose against the\r\nbed above you in the little jerk that usually accompanies the\r\nsternutatory process. The feeding on board is the worst I ever\r\nsaw--tough, cold, and greasy, the whole unpleasantly accompanied with\r\ndirt.\r\n\r\nHaving parted from my travelling companion at New Orleans, one of my\r\nfirst endeavours was, by the aid of physiognomy, to discover some\r\npassenger on whom it might suit me to inflict my society. Casting my\r\neyes around, they soon lit upon a fair-haired youth with a countenance\r\nto match, the expression thereof bespeaking kindness and intelligence;\r\nand when, upon further examination, I saw the most indubitable and\r\nagreeable evidence that his person and apparel were on the most\r\nsuccessful and intimate terms with soap and water, I pounced upon him\r\nwithout delay, and soon found that he was a German gentleman travelling\r\nwith his brother-in-law, and they both had assumed an _incognito_, being\r\ndesirous of avoiding that curious observation which, had their real\r\nposition in life been known, they would most inevitably have been\r\nsubject to. Reader, be not you too curious, for I cannot withdraw the\r\nveil they chose to travel under; suffice it to know, their society added\r\nmuch to my enjoyment, both on the passage and at the Havana. The sailing\r\nof the vessel is so ingeniously managed, that you arrive at the\r\nharbour's mouth just after sunset, and are consequently allowed the\r\nprivilege of waiting outside all night, no vessels except men-of-war\r\nbeing allowed to enter between sunset and daybreak. The hopes of the\r\nmorrow were our only consolation, until at early dawn we ran through the\r\nnarrow battery-girt entrance, and dropped anchor in the land-locked\r\nharbour of Havana.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote T: This was written in January, 1853.--The bale may be roughly\r\nestimated at 450 lbs.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote U: This hotel has long since been re-opened.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote V: All large cities in America must of necessity be\r\ndemocratic.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote W: I have since heard that the Charleston authorities allow\r\nthe captains of vessels to keep their coloured crew on board, under\r\npenalty of a heavy fine in case they land.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n_The Queen of the Antilles_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely morning, not a cloud in the sky; the harbour was as\r\nsmooth as a mirror, and bright with the rays of a sun which had reached\r\nthat height at which--in tropical climates--it gilds and gladdens the\r\nscene without scorching the spectator; the quay was lined with ships\r\nloading and unloading; small boats were flying about in every direction;\r\nall around was gay and fresh, but the filthy steamer was still beneath\r\nme. I lost no time in calling a skiff alongside; then, shaking the dust\r\nfrom off my feet, I was soon pulling away for the shore.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, the Custom-house is the landing-place, and the\r\ngreat object of search seems to be for Filibustero papers, or books\r\nwhich advocate that cause. Having passed this ordeal, you take your\r\nfirst drive in the national vehicle of the island, which rejoices in the\r\nappellation of a \"Volante,\" a name given it, I suppose, in bitter\r\nsarcasm; a \"Tortugante\" would have been far more appropriate, inasmuch\r\nas the pace resembles that of a tortoise far more than that of a bird. I\r\nmay here as well describe one of the best, of which, in spite of its gay\r\nappearance, I feel sure the bare sight would have broken the heart of\r\n\"Humanity Dick of Galway.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the point of the shaft to the axle of the wheel measures fifteen\r\nfeet, and as the wheel varies in diameter from six to seven feet, it of\r\ncourse extends three feet beyond the axle. The body is something like a\r\nswell private cab, the leather at the back being moveable, so as to\r\nadmit air, and a curtain is fitted in front joining the head of the cab\r\nand the splash-board, for the sake of shade, if needed; this body is\r\nsuspended on strong leather springs, attached to the axle at one end,\r\nand to a strengthening-piece across the shafts, seven and a half feet\r\ndistance from the axle, at the other. The point of the shaft is fitted\r\nwith rings, by which it hangs on the back-pad of the horse, whose head\r\nnecessarily extends about four feet beyond; thus you will observe, that\r\nfrom the outer tire of the wheel to the horse's nose occupies at least\r\ntwenty-two feet, and that the poor little animal has the weight of the\r\ncarriage lying on him at the end of a lever fifteen feet long. Owing to\r\ntheir great length, it is excessively difficult to turn them; a \"Tommy\r\nOnslow\" would cut in and out with a four-in-hand fifteen miles an hour,\r\nwhere the poor Volante would come to a regular fix--if the horses in\r\nCuba came into power, they would burn every one of them the next minute.\r\nIt must however be admitted that they are excessively easy to ride in,\r\nand peculiarly suited to a country with bad roads, besides being the\r\ngayest-looking vehicles imaginable; the boxes of the wheels, the ends of\r\nthe axle, the springs for the head, the bar to keep the feet off the\r\nsplash-board, the steps, the points of the fastenings of carriage and\r\nharness are all silvered and kept bright. Nor does the use of the\r\nprecious metal stop here; the niggers who bestride the poor horses are\r\nput into high jack-boots fitted with plated buckles and huge spurs, both\r\nequally brilliant. These niggers have a most comical appearance; they\r\nwear a skull-cap, or a handkerchief under a gold-banded hat; some wear a\r\nred short-tailed jacket, the seams and the front of the collar covered\r\nwith bright yellow, on which are dispersed innumerable emblazonments of\r\nheraldry, even to the very tails, which I should hardly have expected to\r\nfind thus gaily decorated,--it may have been from this practice we have\r\nderived the expression of the seat of honour. The jack-boots they wear\r\nsometimes fit very tight to the legs, in which case poor Sambo has to\r\nroll up his pants till they assume the appearance of small bolsters tied\r\nround the knee, presenting a most ludicrous caricature. The poor little\r\nhorses are all hog-maned, and their tails are neatly plaited down the\r\nwhole length, the point thereof being then tied up to the crupper, so\r\nthat they are as badly off as a certain class of British sheep-dog. This\r\nis probably an ancient custom, originating from a deputation of flies\r\nwaiting upon the authorities, and binding themselves by treaty to leave\r\nthe bipeds in peace if they would allow them the unmolested torture of\r\nthe quadruped.\r\n\r\nIf the owner wishes to \"make a splash,\" another horse, equally silvered,\r\nis harnessed abreast, something like the Russian Furieux; and in the\r\ncountry, where the roads on the plantations are execrable, and quite\r\nimpassable for any spring carriage, a third horse is often added, the\r\npostilion always riding the near, or left-hand horse. The body of the\r\ncarriage is comfortably cushioned, and lined with bright gay colours,\r\nand generally has a stunning piece of carpet for a rug. Such is the\r\nCuban Volante, in which the Hidalgos and the Corazoncitas with glowing\r\nlustrous eyes roll about in soft undulating motion from place to place;\r\nand, believe me, such a Volante, tenanted by fairy forms lightly and\r\ngaily dressed, with a pleasant smile on their lips and an encyclopedia\r\nof language beaming from the orbs above, would arrest the attention of\r\nthe most inveterate old bachelor that ever lived; nay, it might possibly\r\ngive birth to a deep penitential sigh and a host of good and sensible\r\nresolutions. Ordinary Volantes are the same style of thing, only not so\r\ngay, and the usual pace is from three to five and a half miles an hour,\r\nalways allowing five minutes for turning at the corner of every street.\r\nIf you are curious to know why I am in such a hurry to describe a\r\nVolante, as if it were the great feature of Cuba, the reason is, simply,\r\nthat my first act on landing was to get into one of the said vehicles\r\nand drive to the hotel.\r\n\r\nThe horses are generally very neat and compact, and about the size of a\r\nvery small English hack. For riding there are two kinds--the Spanish,\r\nwhich goes at the \"rack\" or amble pace, and the American, which goes the\r\nregular pace; the broad foreheads, short heads, and open nostrils show\r\nplenty of good breeding. The charges both for horses and Volante, if you\r\nwish to go out of the town, are, like everything else in Cuba,\r\nridiculously exorbitant. An American here is doing a tolerably good\r\nbusiness in letting horses and carriages. For a short evening drive, we\r\nhad the pleasure of paying him thirty-five shillings. He says his best\r\ncustomers are a gang of healthy young priests, whom he takes out nearly\r\ndaily to a retired country village famous for the youth and beauty of\r\nits fair sex, and who appear to be very dutiful daughters of the Church,\r\nas they are said to appreciate and profit by the kind visits of these\r\nexcellent young men and their zealous labours of love.\r\n\r\nThere is a very good view of the town from the top of the hotel[X]. Most\r\nof the houses have both flat and sloping roofs, the latter covered with\r\nconcave red tiles, cemented together with white, thus giving them a\r\nstrange freckled appearance; while in many cases the dust and dew have\r\nproduced a little soil, upon which a spontaneous growth of shrubbery has\r\nsprung up; the flat roofs have usually a collection of little urn-shaped\r\nturrets round the battlement, between which are stretched clothes-lines.\r\nHere the ebony daughters of Eve, with their bullet-heads and polished\r\nfaces and necks, may be seen at all hours hanging up washed clothes,\r\ntheir capacious mouths ornamented with long cigars, at which they puff\r\naway like steam-engines.\r\n\r\nOne of the first sights I witnessed was a funeral, but not the solemn,\r\nimposing ceremony which that word conveys to English ears. The sides of\r\nthe hearse and the upper part of the coffin were made of glass; inside\r\nlay a little girl, six or seven years old, dressed as if going to a\r\nwedding, and decorated with gay flowers. Volantes followed, bearing the\r\nmourners--or the rejoicers; I know not which is the more correct term.\r\nOne or two were attired in black, but generally the colours were gay;\r\nsome were quietly smoking cigars, which it is to be hoped they did that\r\nthe ashes at the end thereof might afford them food for profitable\r\nreflection. Custom is said to be second nature, and I suppose,\r\ntherefore, one could get habituated to this system if brought up under\r\nit; but, seen for the first time, it is more calculated to excite\r\nfeelings of curiosity than solemnity. Doubtless, some fond parent's\r\nheart was bleeding deeply, and tears such as a mother only can shed were\r\nflowing freely, despite the gay bridal appearance of the whole ceremony.\r\n\r\nOn my return to the hotel, I found the Press--if the slavish tool of a\r\ngovernment can justly be designated by such a term--full of remarks upon\r\nthe new British Ministry[Y], many of which were amusing enough; they\r\nshowed a certain knowledge of political parties in England, and laughed\r\ngood-humouredly at the bundling together in one faggot of such\r\ndifferently-seasoned sticks. Even the name of the Secretary of the\r\nAdmiralty was honoured by them with a notice, in which they scorned to\r\nlook upon him as a wild democrat. They criticised the great Peel's tail\r\ngoing over in a body to the enemy's camp and placing themselves at the\r\nhead of the troops; but what puzzled them most was, how _aquellos Grey's\r\ntan famosos por el nepotismo_ had not formed part of the ministry. I\r\nconfess they were not more puzzled than I was to account for the\r\nmysterious combination; the only solution whereof which presented itself\r\nto my mind, was the supposition that power has the same influence on\r\npublic men that lollipops have on the juvenile population, and that the\r\none and the other are ready to sacrifice a great deal to obtain\r\npossession of the luscious morsel. However, as we live in an age of\r\nmiracles, we may yet see even a rope of sand, mud, and steel-filings,\r\nhold together.--Pardon this digression, and let us back to Cuba.\r\n\r\nThe Cubans usually dine about half-past three; after dinner some go to\r\nthe _Paseo_ in their Volantes, others lounge on the quay or gather round\r\nthe military band before the Governor-General's palace. Look at that man\r\nwith swarthy countenance, dark hair, and bright eyes--he is seated on a\r\n stone bench listening to the music; a preserved bladder full of\r\ntobacco is open before him, a small piece of thin paper is in his hand;\r\nquick as thought a cigarette is made, and the tobacco returned to his\r\npocket. Now he rises, and walks towards a gentleman who is smoking; when\r\nclose, he raises his right hand, which holds the cigarette, nearly level\r\nwith his chin, then gracefully throwing his hand forward, accompanies\r\nthe act with the simple word _Favor_; having taken his light, the same\r\naction is repeated, followed by a courteous inclination of the head as a\r\nfaintly expressed _Gracias_ escapes his lips. In this man you have a\r\ntype of a very essential portion of the male population. Reader, it is\r\nno use your trying to imitate him; the whole scene, is peculiar to the\r\nSpaniard, in its every act, movement and expression. Old Hippo at the\r\nZoological might as well try to rival the grace of a Taglioni.\r\n\r\nThe promenade over, many spend their evenings at billiards, dominoes,\r\n&c., adjourning from time to time to some _café_ for the purpose of\r\neating ices or sucking goodies, and where any trifling conversation or\r\ndispute is carried on with so much vivacity, both of tongue and of\r\nfingers, that the uninitiated become alarmed with apprehensions of some\r\nserious quarrel. Others again, who are ladies' men, or of domestic\r\nhabits, either go home or meet at some friend's house, where they all\r\nsit in the front room on the ground-floor, with the windows wide open to\r\nthe street, from which they are separated only by a few perpendicular\r\niron bars. Yankee rocking-chairs and cane chairs are placed abreast of\r\nthese windows, and facing each other like lines of sentinels; there they\r\nchat, smoke cigars, or suck their fingers, according to their sex and\r\nfancy. Occasionally a merry laugh is heard, but I cannot say it is very\r\ngeneral. Sometimes they dance, which with them is a slow undulating\r\nmovement, suited to a marble floor and a thermometer at eighty degrees.\r\nAt a small village in the neighbourhood I saw a nigger hall,--the dance\r\nwas precisely the same, being a mixture of country-dance and waltz; and\r\nI can assure you, Sambo and his ebony partner acquitted themselves\r\nadmirably: they were all well dressed, looked very jolly and\r\ncomfortable, and were by no means uproarious.\r\n\r\nYou must not imagine, from my observations on the fair tenant of the\r\nVolante, that this is a land of beauty--far from it: one feature of\r\nbeauty, and one only, is general--good eyes: with that exception, it\r\nis rare; but there are some few lovely daughters of Eve that would make\r\nthe mouth of a marble statue water. Old age here is anything but\r\nattractive, either producing a mountainous obesity, or a skeleton on\r\nwhich the loose dried skin hangs in countless wrinkles. But such is\r\ngenerally the case in warm climates, as far as my observation goes. Any\r\none wishing to verify these remarks, has only to go on the Paseo a\r\nlittle before sunset upon a Sunday evening, when he will be sure to meet\r\nnine-tenths of the population and the Volantes all in gayest attire. The\r\nweather on my arrival was very wet, and I was therefore unable to go\r\ninto the country for some days; but having cleared up, I got my passport\r\nand took a trip into the interior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"EL CASERO,\" THE PARISH HAWKER IN CUBA.]\r\n\r\nThe railway cars are built on the American models, i.e., long cars,\r\ncapable of containing about forty or fifty people; but they have had the\r\ngood sense to establish first, second, and third-class carriages; and,\r\nat the end of each first-class carriage, there is a partition, shutting\r\noff eight seats, so that any party wishing to be private can easily be\r\nso. They travel at a very fair pace, but waste much time at the\r\nstopping-places, and whole hours at junctions. By one of these\r\nconveyances I went to Matanzas, which is very prettily situated in a\r\nlovely bay. There is a ridge, about three miles from the town, which is\r\ncalled the Cumbre, from the summit whereof you obtain a beautiful view\r\nof the valley of the Yumuri, so called from a river of that name, and\r\nconcerning which there is a legend that it is famous for the slaughter\r\nof the Indians by the Spaniards; a legend which, too probably, rests on\r\nthe foundation of truth, if we are to judge by the barbarities which\r\ndimmed the brilliancy of all their western conquests. The valley is now\r\nfruitful in sugar-canes, and surrounded with hills and woods; and the\r\n_coup-d'oeil,_ when seen in the quick changing lights and shadows of the\r\nsetting sun, is quite, enchanting. Continuing our ride, we crossed the\r\nvalley as the moon was beginning to throw her dubious and silvery light\r\nupon the cane fields. A light breeze springing up, their flowery heads\r\nswayed to and fro like waving plumes, while their long leaves, striking\r\none against the other, swept like a mournful sigh across the vale, as\r\nthough Nature were offering its tribute of compassion to the fettered\r\nsons of Adam that had helped to give it birth.\r\n\r\nThere is a very important personage frequently met with in Cuba, who is\r\ncalled _El Casero_--in other words, the parish commissariat pedler. He\r\ntravels on horseback, seated between two huge panniers, and goes round\r\nto all the cottages collecting what they wish to sell, and selling what\r\nthey wish to buy, and every one who addresses him on business he styles,\r\nin reply, _Caserita_. This pedlering system may be very primitive, but\r\nit doubtless is a great convenience to the rural population, especially\r\nin an island which is so deficient in roads and communication. In short,\r\nI consider _El Casero_ the representative of so useful and peculiar a\r\nclass of the community, that I have honoured him with a wood-cut wherein\r\nhe is seen bargaining with a negress for fowls, or _vice\r\nversâ_,--whichever the reader prefers,--for not being the artist, I\r\ncannot undertake to decide which idea he meant to convey.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the town of Matanzas worth seeing except the views\r\nof it and around it. The population amounts to about twenty-five\r\nthousand, and the shipping always helps to give it a gay appearance. My\r\nchief object in visiting these parts was to see something of the sugar\r\nplantations in the island; but as they resemble each other in essential\r\nfeatures, I shall merely describe one of the best, which I visited when\r\nretracing my steps to Havana, and which belongs to one of the most\r\nwealthy men in the island. On driving up to it, you see a large airy\r\nhouse,--windows and doors all open, a tall chimney rearing its proud\r\nhead in another building, and a kind of barrack-looking building round\r\nabout. The hospitable owner appears to delight in having an opportunity\r\nof showing kindness to strangers. He speaks English fluently; but alas!\r\nthe ladies do not; so we must look up our old rusty armoury of Spanish,\r\nand take the field with what courage we may. Kindness and good-will\r\nsmooth all difficulties, and we feel astonished how well we get on; in\r\nshort, if we stay here too long we shall get vain, and think we really\r\ncan speak Spanish,--we must dine, we must stay, we must make the house\r\nour own, and truly I rejoiced that it was so. The house had every\r\ncomfort, the society every charm, and the welcome was as warm as it was\r\nunostentatious. We--for you must know our party was four in number--most\r\ndecidedly lit upon our legs, and the cuisine and the cellar lent\r\neffectual aid. The proprietor is an elderly man, and the son, who has\r\ntravelled a good deal in Europe, manages the properties, which consist\r\nof several plantations, and employ about twelve hundred slaves. The\r\nsound of the lash is rarely heard, and the negroes are all healthy and\r\nhappy-looking; several of them have means to purchase their liberty, but\r\nprefer their present lot. A doctor is kept on the estate for them; their\r\nhouses are clean and decent; there is an airy hospital for them if sick,\r\nand there is a large nursery, with three old women who are appointed to\r\ntake charge during the day of all children too young to work: at night\r\nthey go to their respective families. On the whole property there was\r\nonly one man under punishment, and he was placed to work in chains for\r\nhaving fired one of his master's buildings, which he was supposed to\r\nhave been led to do, owing to his master refusing to allow him to take\r\nhis infant home to his new wife till it was weaned; his former wife had\r\ndied in child-bed, and he wished to rear it on arrowroot, &c. This the\r\nmaster--having found a good wet nurse for it--would not permit. The man\r\nhad generally borne a very good character, and the master, whose\r\n_entourage_ bears strong testimony to his kind rule, seized the\r\nopportunity of my visit to let him free at my request, as he had already\r\nbeen working four months in chains similar to those convicts sometimes\r\nwear; thus were three parties gratified by this act of grace.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that there are various ways of making sugar; but as the\r\nmethod adopted on this plantation contains all the newest improvements,\r\nI may as well give a short detail of the process as I witnessed it. The\r\ncane when brought from the field is placed between two heavy rollers,\r\nworked by steam, and the juice falls into a conductor below--the\r\nsquashed cane being carried away to dry for fuel--whence it is raised by\r\nwhat is termed a \"_monte jus_\" into a tank above the \"clarifier,\" which\r\nis a copper boiler, with iron jacket and steam between. A proper\r\nproportion of lime is introduced, sufficient to neutralize the acidity.\r\nWhen brought to the boiling-point the steam is shut off, and the liquid\r\nsubsides. This operation is one of the most important in the whole\r\nprocess; from the clarifier it is run through an animal charcoal\r\nfilterer, which, by its chemical properties, purifies it; from the\r\nfilterer it runs into a tank, whence it is pumped up above the\r\ncondensers, i.e., tubes, about fifteen in number, laid horizontally,\r\none above the other, and containing the steam from the vacuum pans. The\r\ncold juice in falling over these hot tubes, condenses the steam-therein,\r\nand at the same time evaporates the water, which is always a\r\nconsiderable ingredient in the juice of the cane; the liquor then passes\r\ninto a vacuum pan, which is fitted with a bull's-eye on one side, and a\r\ncorresponding bull's-eye with a lamp on the opposite side, by which the\r\nprocess can be watched. Having boiled here sufficiently, it passes\r\nthrough a second filtration of animal charcoal, and then returns to a\r\nsecond vacuum pan, where it is boiled to the point of granulation; it is\r\nthen run off into heaters below, whence it is ladled into moulds of an\r\nirregular conical shape, in which it is left to cool and to drain off\r\nany molasses that remain; when cooled it is taken to the purging-house.\r\nThe house where the operations which we have been describing were going\r\non, was two hundred yards long, forty yards broad, and built of solid\r\ncedar and mahogany.\r\n\r\nIn the purging-house, these moulds are all ranged with the point of the\r\ncone down, and gutters below. A layer of moist clay, about two inches\r\ndeep, is then placed upon the sugar at the broad end of the cone, and,\r\nby the gradual percolation of its thick liquid, carries off the\r\nremaining impurities. When this operation is finished, the cones are\r\nbrought out, and the sugar contained therein is divided into three\r\nparts, the apex of the cone being the least pure, the middle rather\r\nbetter, and the base the most pure and looking very white. This latter\r\nportion is then placed upon strong wooden troughs, about six or eight\r\nfeet square. There, negroes and negresses break it up with long poles\r\narmed with hard-wood head, trampling it under their delicate pettitoes\r\nto such an extent as to give rise to the question whether sugar-tongs\r\nare not a useless invention. When well smashed and trodden, it is packed\r\nin boxes, and starts forth on its journeys; a very large proportion goes\r\nto Spain. The two least pure portions are sent to Europe, to be there\r\nrefined. Such is a rough sketch of the sugar-making process, as I saw\r\nit. All the machinery was English, and the proprietor had a corps of\r\nEnglish engineers, three in number, to superintend the work. In our\r\nroadless trips to various parts of the plantation, we found the\r\nadvantage of the Volante, before described; and though three horses\r\nwere harnessed, they had in many places enough to do. We stayed a couple\r\nof days with our kind and hospitable friends, and then returned to\r\nHavana.\r\n\r\nNo pen can convey the least idea of the wonderful luxuriance of\r\nvegetation which charms the eye at every step. There is a richness of\r\ncolour and a fatness of substance in the foliage of every tree and shrub\r\nwhich I never met with before in any of my travels. The stately palm,\r\nwith its smooth white stem glittering in the sunbeams like a column of\r\nburnished silver; the waving bamboo growing in little clumps, and\r\nnodding in the gentle breeze with all the graceful appearance of a\r\ngigantic ostrich plume; groves of the mango, with its deep and dark\r\nfoliage defying the sun's rays; the guava, growing at its feet, like an\r\ninfant of the same family; the mammee--or _abricot de St.\r\nDomingue_--with its rich green fruit hanging in clusters, and a foliage\r\nrivalling the mango; the dark and feathery tamarind; the light and\r\ngraceful indigo; the slow-growing arrowroot, with its palmy and feathery\r\nleaves spreading like a tender rampart round its precious fruit;\r\nboundless fields of the rich sugar-cane; acres of the luscious pine\r\napple; groves of banana and plantain; forests of cedar and mahogany;\r\nflowers of every hue and shade; the very jungle netted over with the\r\ncreeping convolvulus,--these, and a thousand others, of which\r\nfortunately for the reader I know not the names, are continually\r\nbursting on the scene with equal profusion and variety, bearing lovely\r\ntestimony to the richness of the soil and the mildness of the climate.\r\n\r\nAlas! that this fair isle should be at one and the same time the richest\r\ngem in the crown of Spain, and the foulest blot on her escutcheon. Her\r\ntreaties are violated with worse than Punic faith, and here horrors have\r\nbeen enacted which would make the blood of a Nero curdle in his veins.\r\nDo you ask, how are treaties violated? When slaves are brought here by\r\nour cruisers, Spain is bound by treaty to apprentice them out for three\r\nyears, so as to teach them how to earn a living, and then to free them.\r\nMy dear John Bull, you will be sorry to hear, that despite the activity\r\nof our squadron for the suppression of slavery, that faithless country\r\nwhich owes a national existence to oceans of British treasure, and the\r\nblood of the finest army the great Wellington ever led, has the\r\nunparalleled audacity to make us slave carriers to Cuba. Yes, thousands\r\nof those who, if honour and truth were to be found in the Government of\r\nSpain, would now be free, are here to be seen pining away their lives in\r\nthe galling and accursed chains of slavery, a living reproach to\r\nEngland, and a black monument of Spanish faith. Yes, John Bull, I repeat\r\nthe fact; thousands of negroes are bound here in hopeless fetters, that\r\nwere brought here under the British flag. And, that there may be no\r\ndoubt of the wilfulness with which the Cuban authorities disregard their\r\nsolemn obligations, it is a notorious fact, that in a country where\r\npassports and police abound in every direction, so that a negro cannot\r\nmove from his own home, upwards of a hundred were landed in the last\r\nyear, 1852, from one vessel, at a place only thirty-five miles from the\r\nHavana, and marched in three days across the island to--where do you\r\nthink?--to some Creole's, or to some needy official's estate? no such\r\nthing; but, as if to stamp infamy on Spain, at the highest step of the\r\nladder, they were marched to the Queen Mother's estate. If this be not\r\nwickedness in high places, what is? The slave trade flourishes\r\nluxuriantly here with the connivance of authority; and what makes the\r\nmatter worse is, that the wealth accumulated by this dishonesty and\r\nnational perjury is but too generally--and I think too justly--believed\r\nto be the mainspring of that corruption at home for which Spain stands\r\npre-eminent among the nations of the earth. I will now give you a sketch\r\nof the cruelties which have been enacted here; and, although an old\r\nstory, I do not think it is very generally known.\r\n\r\nWhen General O'Donnell obtained the captain-generalship of Cuba, whether\r\nhis object was to obtain honours from Spain for quelling an\r\ninsurrection, or whether he was deceived, I cannot decide; but an\r\nimaginary insurrection was got up, and a military court was sent in\r\nevery direction throughout the island. These courts were to obtain all\r\ninformation as to the insurrection, and, of course, to flog the negroes\r\ntill they confessed. Unfledged ensigns would come with their guard upon\r\na plantation, and despite the owner's assurance that there was no\r\nfeeling of insubordination among the negroes, they would set to work\r\nflogging right and left, till in agony the poor negro would say\r\nsomething which would be used to criminate some other, who in turn\r\nwould be flogged till in agony he made some assertion; and so it went\r\non, till the blood-thirsty young officer was satiated. On one plantation\r\na negro lad had been always brought up with one of the sons of the\r\nproprietor, and was, in fact, quite a pet in the family. One of these\r\nmilitary courts visited the plantation, and insisted upon flogging this\r\npet slave till he confessed what he never knew. In vain his master\r\nstrove to convince the officer of his perfect innocence; he would not\r\nlisten, and the poor lad was tied up, and received seven hundred lashes,\r\nduring which punishment some remarks he made in the writhings of his\r\nagony were noted down, and he was shot at Matanzas for the same. The\r\nmaster's son, who was forced to witness this barbarity inflicted upon\r\nthe constant companion of his early youth, never recovered the shock,\r\nand died the following year insane.\r\n\r\nThe streets of Matanzas were in some places running with negro blood. An\r\neye-witness told me that near the village of Guinés he saw a negro\r\nflogged with an aloe-leaf till both hip-bones were perfectly bare; and\r\nthere is little doubt that 1500 slaves died under the lash. You will\r\nperhaps be surprised, most excellent John Bull, when I tell you that the\r\ncruelties did not stop at the negroes, but extended even to whites who\r\nclaimed British protection. One of them was chained to a log of wood in\r\nthe open air for a hundred days and a hundred nights, despite the\r\nstrongest remonstrances on the part of the British authorities, and was\r\neventually unchained, to die two days after in jail. Several others were\r\nimprisoned and cruelly treated; and when this reign of terror, worthy\r\neven of Spain in her bloodiest days, was over, and their case was\r\ninquired into, they were perfectly exonerated, and a compensation was\r\nawarded them. This was in 1844. Some of them have since died from the\r\ntreatment they then received; and, if I am correctly informed, Spain--by\r\nway of keeping up her character--has not paid to those who survive one\r\nfarthing of the sum awarded. Volumes might be filled with the atrocities\r\nof 1844; but the foregoing is enough of the sickening subject. When I\r\ncall to mind the many amiable and high-minded Spaniards I have met, the\r\nnational conduct of Spain becomes indeed a mystery. But to return to\r\npresent times.\r\n\r\nH.M.S. \"Vestal,\" commanded by that active young officer, Captain C.B.\r\nHamilton, was stationed at Cuba for the suppression of slavery, &c. She\r\nhad been watching some suspicious vessels in the harbour for a long\r\ntime; but as they showed no symptoms of moving, she unbent sails and\r\ncommenced painting, &c. A day or two after, as daylight broke, the\r\nsuspicious vessels were missing from the harbour. The \"Vestal\"\r\nimmediately slipped, and, getting the ferry-boat to tow her outside,\r\ncommenced a chase, and the next day succeeded in capturing four vessels.\r\nOf course they were brought into Havana, to be tried at the Mixed Court\r\nthere; three, I believe, were condemned, but the fourth, called the\r\n\"Emilia Arrogante\" is the one to which I wish to call your attention,\r\nbecause she, though the most palpably guilty, belonged to wealthy people\r\nin the island, and therefore, of course, was comparatively safe. When\r\ntaken, the slave-deck which she had on board was carefully put into its\r\nplace, and every plank and beam exactly fitted, as was witnessed and\r\ntestified to by several of the \"Vestal's\" officers; yet, will you\r\nbelieve it, when given up to the local authorities, they either burnt or\r\nmade away with this only but all-sufficient evidence, so that it became\r\nimpossible for the Court to condemn her.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to hear the open way people speak of the bribery of the\r\nofficials in the island, and the consequent endless smuggling that goes\r\non. A captain of a merchant-vessel told me that in certain articles,\r\nwhich, for obvious reasons, I omit to mention, it is impossible to trade\r\nexcept by smuggling; so universal is the practice, that he would be\r\nundersold fifty per cent. He mentioned an instance, when the proper\r\nduties amounted to 1200l., the broker went to the official and\r\nobtained a false entry by which he only paid 400l. duty, and this\r\nfavour cost him an additional 400l. bribe to the official, thus saving\r\n400l. This he assured me, after being several years trading to Cuba,\r\nwas the necessary practice of the small traders; nobody in Cuba is so\r\nhigh that a bribe does not reach him, from the Captain-General, who is\r\nhandsomely paid for breaking his country's plighted faith in permitting\r\nthe landing of negroes, down to the smallest unpaid official. With\r\ntwo-thirds the excuse is, \"We are so ill-paid, we must take bribes;\"\r\nwith the other third the excuse is, \"It is the custom of the island.\"\r\nSpain could formerly boast pre-eminence in barbarity--she has now\r\nattained to pre-eminence in official corruption; but the day must come,\r\nthough it may yet be distant, when her noble sons of toil will burst the\r\nfetters of ignorance in which they are bound, and rescue their fair land\r\nfrom the paltry nothingness of position which it occupies among the\r\nnations of Europe, despite many generous and noble hearts which even\r\nnow, in her degradation, are to be found blushing over present realities\r\nand striving to live on past recollections.\r\n\r\nThere were some British men-of-war lying in the harbour; and as my two\r\nGerman friends were anxious to see the great-gun exercise, I went on\r\nboard with these gentlemen to witness the drill, with which they were\r\nmuch pleased. After it was over, and the ship's company had gone to\r\ndinner, they wished to smoke a cigar, the whiffs of Jack's pipe having\r\nreached their olfactories. Great was their astonishment, and infinite my\r\ndisgust, when we were walked forward to the galley to enjoy our weed, to\r\nfind the crew smoking on the opposite side. It is astonishing to think\r\nthat, with so much to be improved and attended to in the Navy, the\r\nauthorities in Whitehall-place should fiddle-faddle away precious time\r\nin framing regulations about smoking, for the officers; and, instead of\r\nleaving the place to be fixed by the captain of each vessel, and holding\r\nhim responsible, should name a place which, it is not too much to say,\r\nscarce one captain in ten thinks of confining his officers to, for the\r\nobvious reason that discipline is better preserved by keeping the\r\nofficers and men apart during such occupations,--and, moreover, that\r\nsending officers to the kitchen to smoke is unnecessarily offensive.\r\nThese same orders existed thirty years ago; and, as it was well known\r\nthey were never attended to, except by some anti-smoking captain, who\r\nused them as an excuse, the Admiralty very wisely rescinded an order\r\nwhich, by being all but universally disregarded, tended to weaken the\r\nweight and authority of all other orders; and after the word \"galley,\"\r\nthey then added, \"or such other place as the captain shall appoint.\"\r\nAfter some years, however, so little was there of greater importance to\r\nengage their attention in naval affairs, that this sensible order was\r\nrescinded, and the original one renewed in full force, and, of course,\r\nwith similar bad effect, as only those captains who detest smoking--an\r\ninvisible minority--or those who look for promotion from scrupulous\r\nobedience to insignificant details--an equally invisible minority--act\r\nup to the said instructions. Nevertheless, so important an element in\r\nnaval warfare is smoking now considered, that in the printed form\r\nsupplied to admirals for the inspection of vessels under their command,\r\nas to \"State and Preparation for Battle,\" one of the first questions is,\r\n\"Are the orders relative to smoking attended to?\" If I am not much\r\nmisinformed, when Admiral Collier was appointed to the Channel squadron,\r\nhe repaired to the Admiralty, and told the First Lord that he had smoked\r\nin his own cabin for twenty years, and that he could not forego that\r\npleasure. The First Lord is said to have laughed, and made the sensible\r\nremark, \"Of course you'll do as you like;\" thereby showing, in my\r\nopinion, his just sense of the ridiculousness of such a childish\r\nregulation. So much for folly _redivivus_.\r\n\r\nWhile on the subject of smoking, I may as well say a few words upon\r\ncigar manufacture. In the first place, all the best tobacco grows at the\r\nlower end of the island, and is therefore called \"_Vuelta abajo_.\" An\r\nidea has found its way into England, that it is impossible to make\r\ncigars at home as well as at the Havana; and the reason given is, the\r\ntobacco is made up at Havana during its first damping, and that, having\r\nto be re-damped in England, it loses thereby its rich flavour and aroma.\r\nNow, this is a most egregious mistake; for in some of the best houses\r\nhere you will find tobacco two and even four years old, which is not yet\r\nworked up into cigars, and which, consequently, has to be re-damped for\r\nthat purpose. If this be so, perhaps you will ask how is it that\r\nBritish-made cigars are never so good as those from Havana? There are\r\ntwo very good reasons for this--the one certain, the other probable. The\r\nprobable one is, that the best makers in Havana, whose brand is their\r\nfortune--such as Cabaños y Carvajal--will be jealous of sending the\r\nbest tobacco out of the country, lest, being forced to use inferior\r\ntobacco, they might lose their good name; and the other reason is, that\r\ncigars improve in flavour considerably by a sea voyage. So fully is this\r\nfact recognised here, that many merchants pay the duty of three\r\nshillings a thousand to embark their cigars in some of the West India\r\nsteamers, and then have them carried about for a month or so, thereby\r\ninvolving a further payment for freight; and they all express\r\nthemselves as amply repaid by the improvement thereby effected in their\r\ncigars. Nevertheless, many old Cubans prefer smoking cigars the same\r\nweek that they are made. At the same time, if any honest tobacconist in\r\nEngland chose to hoist the standard of \"small profit and plenty of it,\"\r\nhe might make very good Havana tobacco cigars, at 50 per cent. profit,\r\nunder 16s. per 100. Thus--duty, 3s. 6_d_; tobacco, 5s.; freight and\r\ndues, &c., 6d.; making up, 1s. 6d.--absolute cost of cigars, 10s.\r\n6d. per 100; 50 per cent. profit thereon, 5s. 3d.; total, 15s. 9d.\r\nFor this sum a better article could be supplied than is ordinarily\r\nobtained at prices varying from 25s. to 30s.\r\n\r\nBut 50 per cent. profit will not satisfy the British tobacconist when he\r\nfinds John Bull willing to give him 100 per cent. He therefore makes the\r\ncigars at the prices above-mentioned, puts them into old boxes with some\r\npet brand upon them, and sells them as the genuine article. John Bull is\r\nindebted for this extortionate charge to the supreme wisdom of the\r\nLegislature, which has established a 3s. 6d. duty on the pound of\r\nunmanufactured tobacco, and a 9s. duty on manufactured; instead of\r\nfixing one duty for manufactured and unmanufactured, and making the\r\ndifference thereof depend upon the quality--lowering the duty upon the\r\ntobacco used by the poor to 2s. 6d., and establishing on all the\r\nbetter kinds a uniform rate, say 6s. or 7s. The revenue, I believe,\r\nwould gain, and the public have a better protection against the fraud of\r\nwhich they are now all but universal victims. But to return to Havana.\r\n\r\nThe price paid for making cigars varies from 8s. to 80s. a thousand,\r\nthe average being about 15s. A certain quality of tobacco is made up\r\ninto cigars, and from time to time they are handed over to the examiner,\r\nwho divides them into three separate classes, the difference being\r\nmerely in the make thereof. A second division then takes place,\r\nregulated by the colour of the outside wrapper, making the distinction\r\nof \"light\" or \"brown.\" Now, the three classes first noticed, you will\r\nobserve, are precisely the same tobacco; but knowing how the public are\r\ngulled by the appearance, the prices are very different. Thus, taking\r\nthe brand of Cabaños y Carvajal _Prensados_, his first, or prettiest,\r\nare 6l. 8s. per 1000; his second are 5l. 12s.; and his third are\r\n5l.; and yet no real difference of quality exists. The cigars of which\r\nI speak are of the very best quality, and the dearest brand in Havana.\r\nNow, let us see what they cost put into the tobacconist's shop in\r\nLondon:--32 dollars is 180s.; duty, 90s.; export at Havana, 3s.;\r\nfreight and extra expenses, say 7s.--making 230s. a thousand, or\r\n23s. a hundred, for the dearest and best Havana cigars, London size.\r\nBut three-fourths of the cigars which leave the Havana for England do\r\nnot cost more than 3l. 4s. per thousand, which would bring their\r\ncost price to the tobacconist down to 16s. 5d. The public know what\r\nthey pay, and can make their own reflections.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of cigar known in England as \"Plantations,\" here\r\ncalled \"Vegueros.\" They are of the richest tobacco, and are all made in\r\nthe country by the sable ladies of the island, who use no tables to work\r\nat, if report speaks truth; and as both hands are indispensable in the\r\nprocess of rolling, what they roll upon must be left to the imagination.\r\nIt will not do to be too fastidious in this world. Cooks finger the\r\ndainty cutlets, and keep dipping their fingers into the rich sauces, and\r\nsucking them, to ascertain their progress, and yet the feasters relish\r\nthe savoury dish not one whit the less; so smokers relish the Veguero,\r\nthough on what rolled modesty forbids me to mention,--nor do they\r\nhesitate to press between their lips the rich \"Regalia,\" though its\r\nbeautifully-finished point has been perfected by an indefinite number of\r\npassages of the negro's forefinger from the fragrant weed to his own\r\nrosy tongue. Men must not be too nice; but I think in the above\r\ndescription a fair objection is to be found to ladies smoking.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the population of Cuba, the authorities, of course, wish\r\nto give currency to the idea that the whites are the most numerous.\r\nHaving asked one of these officials who had the best means of knowing,\r\nhe told me there were 550,000 whites and 450,000 negroes; but\r\nprosecuting my inquiries in a far more reliable quarter, I found there\r\nwere 600,000 slaves, 200,000 free, and only 500,000 whites,--thus making\r\nthe coloured population as eight to five. The military force in the\r\nisland consists of 20,000, of which 18,000 are infantry, 1000 cavalry,\r\nand 1000 artillery[Z]. The demand for labour in the island is so great,\r\nthat a speculation has been entered into by a mercantile house here to\r\nbring 6000 Chinese. The speculator has already disposed of them at\r\n24l. a-head; they are to serve for five years, and receive four\r\nshillings a day, and they find their own way back. The cost of bringing\r\nthem is calculated at 10l. a head,--thus leaving 14l. gain on each,\r\nwhich, multiplied by 6000, gives 84,000l. profit to the\r\nspeculator,--barring, of course, losses from deaths and casualties on\r\nthe journey. Chinese have already been tried here, and they prove\r\nadmirably suited to all the mechanical labour, but far inferior to the\r\nnegroes in the fields.\r\n\r\nI find that people in the Havana can he humbugged as well as John Bull.\r\nA Chinese botanist came here, and bethought him of trying his skill as a\r\ndoctor. Everybody became mad to consult him; no street was ever so\r\ncrowded as the one he lived in, since Berners-street on the day of the\r\nhoax. He got a barrel of flour, or some other innocuous powder, packed\r\nup in little paper parcels, and thus armed he received his patients. On\r\nentering, he felt the pulse with becoming silence and gravity; at last\r\nhe said, \"Great fire.\" He then put his hand on the ganglionic centre,\r\nfrom which he radiated to the circumjacent parts, and then, frowning\r\ndeep thought, he observed, \"Belly great swell; much wind; pain all\r\nround.\" His examination being thus accomplished, he handed the patient a\r\npaper of the innocuous powder, pocketed sixteen shillings, and dismissed\r\nhim. This scene, without any variety in observation, examination,\r\nprescription, or fee, was going on for two months, at the expiration of\r\nwhich time he re-embarked for China with 8000l.\r\n\r\nAs I believe that comparatively little is known in England of the laws\r\nexisting in Cuba with respect to domicile, police, slavery, &c., I shall\r\ndevote a few pages to the subject, which, in some of its details, is\r\namusing enough. No person is allowed to land on the island without a\r\npassport from the place whence he arrives, and a _fiador_, or surety, in\r\nthe island, who undertakes to supply the authorities with information of\r\nthe place of his residence for one year; nor can he remain in the island\r\nmore than three months without a \"domiciliary ticket.\" People of colour\r\narriving in any vessel are to be sent to a government deposit; if the\r\nmaster prefers to keep them on board he may, but in that case he is\r\nliable to a fine of 200l. if any of them land on the island; after a\r\ncertain hour in the evening all gatherings in the street are put a stop\r\nto, and everybody is required to carry a lantern about with him; the\r\nhierarchy and \"swells\"--_personas de distincion_--being alone exempt.\r\nAll purchases made from slaves or children or doubtful parties are at\r\nthe risk of the purchaser, who is liable not merely to repay the price\r\ngiven, but is further subject to a heavy fine: no bad law either. Any\r\nboy between the ages of ten and sixteen who may be found in the streets\r\nas a vagrant may be taken before the president of the _Seccion de\r\nIndustria de la Real Sociedad Economica_, by whom he is articled out to\r\na master of the trade he wishes to learn. No place of education can be\r\nopened without the teacher thereof has been duly licensed. No game of\r\nchance is allowed in any shop or tavern, except in billiard-saloons and\r\ncoffee-houses, where draughts and dominoes, chess and backgammon are\r\ntolerated. After a certain fixed hour of the night, no person is allowed\r\nto drive about in a Volante with the head up, unless it rains or the\r\nsitter be an invalid; the penalty is fifteen shillings. No private\r\nindividual is allowed to give a ball or a concert without permission of\r\nthe authorities. Fancy Londonderry House going to the London\r\npolice-office to get permission for a quadrille or a concert. How\r\npleasant! The specific gravity of milk is accurately calculated, and but\r\na moderate margin allowed for pump mixture; should that margin be\r\nexceeded, or any adulteration discovered, the whole is forfeited to some\r\ncharitable institution. If such a salutary law existed in London, pigs'\r\nbrains would fall in the market, and I should not see so many milk-pails\r\nat the spring during my early morning walks to the Serpentine.\r\n\r\nAmong the regulations for health, the following are to be found. No\r\nprivate hospital or infirmary is to be opened without a government\r\nlicence. All keepers of hotels, coffee or eating houses, &c., are bound\r\nto keep their kitchen \"battery\" well tinned inside, under a heavy\r\npenalty of 3l. 10s. for every utensil which may be found\r\ninsufficiently tinned, besides any further liabilities to which they may\r\nbe subject for accidents arising from neglect thereof. Every shop is\r\nobliged to keep a vessel with water at the threshold of the outer door,\r\nto assist in avoiding hydrophobia. All houses that threaten to tumble\r\ndown must be rebuilt, and if the owner is unable to bear the expense,\r\nhe must sell the house to some one who can bear it. Another clause,\r\nafter pointing out the proper places for bathing, enjoins a pair of\r\nbathing breeches, under a penalty of fifteen shillings for each offence;\r\nthe particular cut is not specified. Let those who object to put convex\r\nfig-leaves over the little cherubs, and other similar works of art at\r\nthe Crystal Palace, take a lesson from the foregoing, and clothe them\r\nall in Cuba pants as soon as possible; scenes are generally more\r\ninteresting when the imagination is partially called into play. Boys,\r\nboth little and big, are kept in order by a fine of fifteen shillings\r\nfor every stone they throw, besides paying in full for all damage caused\r\nthereby. No one is allowed to carry a stick more than one inch in\r\ndiameter under a penalty of twelve shillings; but all white people are\r\nallowed to carry swords, provided they are carried openly and in their\r\nscabbards.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing are sufficient to convey to the reader some idea of the\r\nban of pains and penalties under which a resident is placed; at the same\r\ntime it may be as well to inform him, that, except those enactments\r\nwhich bear upon espionage, they are about as much attended to as the\r\nlaws with regard to the introduction of slaves, respecting which latter\r\nI will now give you a few of the regulations.\r\n\r\nSlave owners are bound to give their slaves three meals a-day, and the\r\nsubstance thereof must be eleven ounces of meat or salt-fish, four\r\nounces of bread, and farinaceous vegetables equal to six plantains;\r\nbesides this, they are bound to give them two suits of clothes--all\r\nspecified--yearly. Alas! how appropriate is the slang phrase \"Don't you\r\nwish you may get 'em?\" So beautifully motherly is Spain regarding her\r\nslaves, that the very substance of infants' clothes under three years of\r\nage is prescribed; another substance from three to six; then comes an\r\ninjunction that from six to fourteen the girls are to be shirted and the\r\nboys breeched. I am sure this super-parental solicitude upon the part of\r\nthe Government must be admitted to be most touching. By another\r\nregulation, the working time is limited from nine to ten hours daily,\r\nexcept in the harvest or sugar season, during which time the working\r\nhours are eighteen a-day. No slave under sixteen or over sixty can be\r\nemployed on task-work, or at any age at a work not suited to his or her\r\nstrength and sex.\r\n\r\nOld slaves must be kept by their master, and cannot be freed for the\r\npurpose of getting rid of the support of them. Upon a plantation, the\r\nhouses must be built on a dry position, well ventilated, and the sexes\r\nkept apart, and a proper hospital provided for them. By another law,\r\nmarriage is inculcated on moral grounds, and the master of the slave is\r\nrequired to purchase the wife, so that they may both be under one roof;\r\nif he declines the honour, then the owner of the wife is to purchase the\r\nhusband; and if that fails, a third party is to buy both: failing all\r\nthese efforts, the law appears non-plused, and leaves their fate to\r\nProvidence. If the wife has any children under three years of age, they\r\nmust be sold with her. The law can compel an owner to sell any slave\r\nupon whom he may be proved to have exercised cruelty; should any party\r\noffer him the price he demands, he may close the bargain at once, but if\r\nthey do not agree, his value is to be appraised by two arbiters, one\r\nchosen by each party, and if either decline naming an arbiter, a law\r\nofficer acts _ex officio_. Any slave producing fifty dollars (ten\r\npounds) as a portion of his ransom-money, the master is obliged to fix a\r\nprice upon him, at which his ransom may be purchased; he then becomes a\r\n_coartado_, and whatever sums he can save his master is bound to receive\r\nin part payment, and, should he be sold, the price must not exceed the\r\nprice originally named, after subtracting therefrom the amount he has\r\nadvanced for his ransom. Each successive purchaser must buy him subject\r\nto these conditions. In all disputes as to original price or completion\r\nof the ransom, the Government appoints a law officer on behalf of the\r\nslave. The punishments of the slave are imprisonment, stocks, &c.; when\r\nthe lash is used, the number of stripes is limited to twenty-five.\r\n\r\nThe few regulations I have quoted are sufficient to show how carefully\r\nthe law has fenced-in the slave from bad treatment. I believe the laws\r\nof no other country in regard to slaves are so merciful, excepting\r\nalways Peru; but, alas! though the law is as fair as the outside of the\r\nwhited sepulchre, the practice is as foul as the inside thereof; nor can\r\none ever expect that it should be otherwise, when we see that, following\r\nthe example of the treaty-breaking, slave-importing Queen Mother, every\r\nofficial, from the highest government authority down to the lowest petty\r\ncustom-house officer, exposes his honesty daily in the dirty market of\r\nbribery.\r\n\r\nA short summary of the increase of slave population may be interesting,\r\nas showing that the charges made against the Cubans of only keeping up\r\nthe numbers of the slaves by importation is not quite correct. In the\r\nyear 1835 a treaty was made with Spain, renewing the abolition of slave\r\ntraffic, to which she had assented in 1817 by words which her subsequent\r\ndeeds belied. At this latter date, the slave population amounted to\r\n290,000, since which period she has proved the value of plighted faith\r\nby introducing upwards of 100,000 slaves, which would bring the total up\r\nto 390,000. The present slave population, I have before remarked,\r\namounts to 600,000, which would give as the increase by births during\r\nnearly twenty years, 210,000. If we take into consideration the ravages\r\nof epidemics, and the serious additional labour caused by the long\r\nduration of the sugar harvest, we may fairly conclude, as far as\r\nincrease by birth is admitted as evidence, that the treatment of slaves\r\nin Cuba will stand comparison with that of the slave in the United\r\nStates, especially when it is borne in mind that the addition of slave\r\nterritory in the latter has made the breeding of slaves a regular\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThe increase of the produce of Cuba may very naturally be ascribed to\r\nthe augmentation of slave labour, and to the improvements in machinery;\r\nbut there is another cause which is very apt to be overlooked, though I\r\nthink there can be no doubt it has exercised the most powerful influence\r\nin producing that result: I allude to the comparative monopoly of the\r\nsugar trade, which the events of late years have thrown into her hands.\r\n\r\nWhen England manumitted the 750,000 slaves in the neighbouring islands,\r\nthe natural law of reaction came into play, and the negro who had been\r\nforced to work hard, now chose to take his ease, and his absolute\r\nnecessities were all that he cared to supply: a little labour sufficed\r\nfor that, and he consequently became in his turn almost the master. The\r\nblack population, unprepared in any way for the sudden change, became\r\nday by day more idle and vicious, the taxes of the islands increased,\r\nand the circulation issued by the banks decreased in an equally fearful\r\nratio. When sugar the produce of slave labour was admitted into England,\r\na short time after the emancipation, upon the same terms as the produce\r\nof the free islands, as a natural consequence, the latter, who could\r\nonly command labour at high wages and for uncertain time, were totally\r\nunable to compete with the cheap labour and long hours of work in Cuba;\r\nnearly every proprietor in our West India colonies feel into deep\r\ndistress,--some became totally ruined. One property which had cost\r\n118,000l., so totally lost its value, owing to these changes in the\r\nlaw, that its price fell to 16,000l. In Demerara, the sugar produce\r\nsank from 104,000,000 lbs. to 61,000,000 lbs., and coffee from 9,000,000\r\nlbs. to 91,000 lbs., while 1,500,000 lbs. of cotton disappeared\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\nThese are no fictions, they are plain facts, borne testimony to in many\r\ninstances by the governors of the colonies; and I might quote an\r\ninfinite number of similar statements, all tending to prove the rapid\r\ngrowth of idleness and vice in the emancipated slaves, and the equally\r\nrapid ruin of the unfortunate proprietor. The principles upon which we\r\nlegislated when removing the sugar duties is a mystery to me, unless I\r\naccept the solution, so degrading to the nation, \"that humanity is a\r\nsecondary consideration to _£ s.d._, and that justice goes for nothing.\"\r\nIf such were not the principles on which we legislated, there never was\r\na more complete failure. Not content with demoralizing the slave and\r\nruining the owner, by our hasty and ill-matured plan of emancipation, we\r\ngave the latter a dirty kick when he was falling, by removing the little\r\nprotection we had all put pledged our national faith that he should\r\nretain; and thus it was we threw nearly the whole West India sugar trade\r\ninto the hands of Cuba, stimulating her energy, increasing her produce,\r\nand clinching the fetters of the slave with that hardest holding of all\r\nrivets--the doubled value of his labour.\r\n\r\nPerhaps my reader may say I am taking a party and political view of the\r\nquestion. I repudiate the charge _in toto_: I have nothing to do with\r\npolitics: I merely state facts, which I consider it requisite should be\r\nbrought forward, in order that the increase of Cuban produce may not be\r\nattributed to erroneous causes. For this purpose it was necessary to\r\nshow that the ruin we have brought upon the free West Indian colonies is\r\nthe chief cause of the increased and increasing prosperity of their\r\nslave rival; at the same time, it is but just to remark, that the\r\nestablishment of many American houses in Cuba has doubtless had some\r\neffect in adding to the commercial activity of the island.\r\n\r\nI have, in the preceding pages, shown the retrogression of some parts of\r\nthe West Indies, since the passing of the Emancipation and Sugar-Duty\r\nActs. Let me now take a cursory view of the progression of Cuba during\r\nthe same period.--Annual produce--\r\n\r\n          Previous to Emancipation.            1852.\r\n\r\n  Sugar        300,000,000 lbs.     --     620,000,000 lbs.\r\n  Molasses     125,000,000  \"       --     220,000,000  \"\r\n  Leaf Tobacco   6,000,000  \"       --      10,000,000  \"\r\n  Coffee        30,000,000  \"       --      19,000,000  \"\r\n\r\nThe sugar manufactories during that time had also increased from eight\r\nhundred to upwards of sixteen hundred. Can any one calmly compare this\r\nmarvellous progression of Cuba with the equally astounding retrogression\r\nof our Antilles, and fail to come to the irresistible conclusion that\r\nthe prosperity of the one is intimately connected with the distress of\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nWhile stating the annual produce of tobacco, I should observe that\r\nupwards of 180,000,000 of cigars, and nearly 2,000,000 boxes of\r\ncigarettes, were exported in 1852, independent of the tobacco-leaf\r\nbefore mentioned. Professor J.F.W. Johnston, in that curious and able\r\nwork entitled _Chemistry of Common Life_, styles tobacco \"the first\r\nsubject in the vegetable kingdom in the power of its service to\r\nman,\"--some of my lady friends, I fear, will not approve of this\r\nopinion,--and he further asserts that 4,500,000,000 lbs. thereof are\r\nannually dispersed throughout the earth, which, at twopence the pound,\r\nwould realize the enormous sum of 37,000,000l.\r\n\r\nIf smoking may be called the popular enjoyment of the island, billiards\r\nand dominoes may be called the popular games, and the lottery the\r\npopular excitement. There are generally fifteen ordinary lotteries, and\r\ntwo extraordinary, every year. The ordinary consist of 32,000l. paid,\r\nand 24,000l. thereof as prizes. There are 238 prizes, the highest\r\nbeing 600l., and the lowest 40l. The extraordinary consist of\r\n54,400l. paid, of which 40,800l. are drawn as prizes. There are 206\r\nprizes, the highest of which is 20,000l., and the lowest 40l.; from\r\nwhich it will appear, according to Cocker, that the sums drawn annually\r\nas prizes are very nearly 150,000l. less than the sums paid. Pretty\r\npickings for Government! As may naturally be supposed, the excitement\r\nproduced by this constitutional gambling--which has its nearest\r\ncounterpart in our own Stock Exchange--is quite intense; and as the time\r\nfor drawing approaches, people may be seen in all the _cafés_ and public\r\nplaces, hawking and auctioning the billets at premium, like so many\r\nBarnums with Jenny Lind tickets. One curious feature in the lotteries\r\nhere is the interest the niggers take in them. To understand this, I\r\nmust explain to you that the coloured population are composed of various\r\nAfrican tribes, and each tribe keeps comparatively separate from the\r\nothers; they then form a kind of club among their own tribe, for the\r\npurpose of purchasing the freedom of some of their enslaved brethren,\r\nwho, I believe, receive assistance in proportion as they contribute to\r\nthe funds, and bear such a character as shall interpose no obstacle to\r\ntheir ransom being permitted. A portion of their funds is frequently\r\nemployed in the purchase of lottery-tickets, and a deep spirit of\r\ngambling is the natural consequence; for though the stake entered is\r\ndollars, the prize, if won, is freedom. These lotteries date back to\r\n1812; and if they have always been kept up as before explained, they\r\nmust have contributed something like ten millions sterling to the\r\nGovernment during their forty years' working.\r\n\r\nA friend told me of a shameful instance of injustice connected with\r\nthese lotteries. A poor slave who had saved enough money to buy a\r\nticket, did so; and, drawing a small prize, immediately went off to his\r\nmaster, and presented it to him as a part of his redemption-money. The\r\nmaster having ascertained how he obtained it, explained to him that, as\r\na slave, he could not hold property; he then quietly pocketed it, and\r\nsent poor Sambo about his business. What a beautiful commentary this is\r\non the law respecting Coartados, which I inserted a few pages back. I\r\nmust, however, remark that, from the inquiries I made, and from my own\r\nobservations of their countenances and amusements, the impression left\r\non my mind is, that the slaves are quite as happy here as in the United\r\nStates; the only disadvantage that they labour under being, that the\r\nsugar harvest and manufacture last much longer in Cuba, and the labour\r\nthereof is by far the hardest drain upon the endurance of the slave. The\r\nfree negroes I consider fully as well off as those in the Southern\r\nStates, and immeasurably more comfortable than those who are domiciled\r\nin the Northern or Free States of the Union. The number of free negroes\r\nin Cuba amounts to one-fourth of the whole coloured population, while in\r\nthe United States it only amounts to one-ninth--proving the great\r\nfacilities for obtaining freedom which the island offers, or the higher\r\ncultivation of the negro, which makes him strive for it more\r\nlaboriously. I will not attempt to draw any comparison between the\r\nscenes of horror with which, doubtless, both parties are chargeable, but\r\nwhich, for obvious reasons, are carefully concealed from the traveller's\r\neye.\r\n\r\nAmong the curious anomalies of some people, is that of a dislike to be\r\ncalled by the national name, if they have a local one. The islanders\r\nfeel quite affronted if you call them Españoles; and a native of Old\r\nSpain would feel even more affronted if you called him a Cubano or an\r\nHavanero. The appellations are as mutually offensive as were in the\r\nolden times those of Southron and Scot, although Cuba is eternally\r\nmaking a boast of her loyalty. The manner of a Cuban is as stiff and\r\nhidalgoish as that of any old Spaniard; in fact, so far as my short\r\nacquaintance with the mother country and the colony enables me to judge,\r\nI see little or no difference. Some of them, however, have a dash of fun\r\nabout them, as the two following little squibs will show.\r\n\r\nIt appears that a certain Conde de ----, who had lately been decorated,\r\nwas a most notorious rogue; in consequence of which, some wag chalked up\r\non his door in large letters, during the night, the following lines,\r\nwhich, of course, were in everybody's mouth soon after the sun had\r\nrisen:--\r\n\r\n  En el tiempo de las barbaras naciones\r\n  A los ladrones se les colgaban en cruces;\r\n  Pero hoy en el siglo de las luces\r\n  A los ladrones se les cuelgan cruces.\r\n\r\nA play upon words is at all times a hopeless task to transfer to another\r\nlanguage; nevertheless, for the benefit of those who are unacquainted\r\nwith Spanish, I will convey the idea as well as I can in English;--\r\n\r\n  Hang the thief on the cross was the ancient decree;\r\n  But the cross on the thief now suspended we see.\r\n\r\nThe idea is of very ancient date, and equally well known in Italy and\r\nSpain; but I believe the Spanish verses given above are original.\r\n\r\nThe following was written upon a wealthy man who lived like a hermit,\r\nand was reported to be very averse to paying for anything. He had, to\r\nthe astonishment of everybody, given a grand entertainment the night\r\nbefore. On his door appeared--\r\n\r\n  \"El Marquis de C---- Hace lo que debe\r\n  Y debe por lo que hace.\"\r\n\r\nIt is useless to try and carry this into Saxon. In drawing it from the\r\nSpanish well, the bottom must come out of the translationary bucket. The\r\nbest version I can offer is--\r\n\r\n  \"He gives a party, which he ought to do,\r\n  But, doing that, he _does_ his tradesmen too.\"\r\n\r\nI am aware my English version is tame and insipid, though, perhaps, not\r\nquite as much so as a translation I once met with of the sentence with\r\nwhich it was said Timoleon, Duc de Brissac, used to apostrophize himself\r\nbefore the looking-glass every morning. The original runs thus:--\r\n\"Timoleon, Duc de Brissac, Dieu t'a fait gentilhomme, le roi t'a fait\r\nduc, fais toi la barbe, pour faire quelque chose.\" The translation was\r\ncharmingly ridiculous, and ran thus:--\"Timoleon, Duke of Brissac,\r\nProvidence made you a gentleman; the king gave you a dukedom; shave\r\nyourself by way of doing something.\"--But I wander terribly. Reader, you\r\nmust excuse me.\r\n\r\nI one day asked an intelligent friend, long resident in the island,\r\nwhether any of the governors had ever done any good to the island, or\r\nwhether they were all satisfied by filling their pockets with handsome\r\nbribes. He told me that the first governor-general who had rendered real\r\nservice to the people was Tacon. On his arrival, the whole place was so\r\ninfested with rogues and villains that neither property nor even life\r\nwas secure after dusk. Gambling, drunkenness, and vice of every kind\r\nrode rampant. He gave all evil-doers one week's warning, at the\r\nexpiration of which all who could not give a satisfactory account of\r\nthemselves were to be severely punished. Long accustomed to idle\r\nthreats, they treated his warning with utter indifference; but they soon\r\nfound their mistake, to their cost. Inflexible in purpose, iron-handed\r\nin rule, unswerving in justice, he treated nobles, clergy, and commoners\r\nalike, and, before the fortnight was concluded, twelve hundred were in\r\nbanishment or in durance vile. Their accomplices in guilt stood aghast\r\nat this new order of things, and, foreseeing their fate, either bolted,\r\nreformed, or fell victims to it, and Havana became as quiet and orderly\r\nas a church-parade. Shops, stores, and houses sprung up in every\r\ndirection. A magnificent opera-house was built outside the town, on the\r\nGrand Paseo, and named after the governor-general; nothing can exceed\r\nthe lightness, airiness, and taste of the interior. I never saw its\r\nequal in any building of a similar nature, and it is in every respect\r\nmost perfectly adapted to this lovely climate.\r\n\r\nThe next governor-general who seems to have left any permanent mark of\r\nusefulness is Valdes, whom I suppose I may be allowed to call their\r\nmodern Lycurgus. It was during his rule that the laws were weeded and\r\nimproved, and eventually produced in a clear and simple form. The\r\npatience he must have exhibited in this laborious occupation is\r\nevidenced by the minuteness of the details entered into, descending, as\r\nwe have seen, even to the pants of bathers and the bibs of the infant\r\nnigger, but, by some unaccountable omission, giving no instructions as\r\nto the tuckers of their mammas. If Tacon was feared and respected,\r\nValdes was beloved; and each appears to have fairly earned the\r\nreputation he obtained. Valdes was succeeded by O'Donnell, whose rule\r\nwas inaugurated in negro blood. Frightful hurricanes soon followed, and\r\nwere probably sent in mercy to purify the island from the pollutions of\r\nsuffering and slaughter. During the rule of his successor, Roncali, the\r\nrebel Lopez appears on the stage. The American campaign in Mexico had\r\nstirred up a military ardour which extended to the rowdies, and a\r\npiratical expedition was undertaken, with Lopez at the head. He had\r\nacquired a name for courage in the Spanish army, and was much liked by\r\nmany of them, partly from indulging in the unofficer-like practice of\r\ngambling and drinking with officers and men. His first attempt at a\r\nlanding was ludicrously hopeless, and he was very glad to re-embark\r\nwith a whole skin; but he was not the man to allow one failure to\r\ndishearten him, for, independent of his courage, he had a feeling of\r\nrevenge to gratify.[AA] Having recruited his forces, he landed the\r\nfollowing year, 1851, with a stronger and better-equipped force of\r\nAmerican piratical brigands, and succeeded in stirring up a few Cubans\r\nto rebellion. He maintained himself for a few days, struggling with a\r\ncourage worthy of a better cause. The pirates were defeated; Lopez was\r\nmade prisoner, and died by the garotte, at Havana, on the 1st of\r\nSeptember. Others also of the band paid the penalty of the law; and the\r\nruffian crew, who escaped to the United States, now constitute a kind of\r\nnucleus for the \"Lone Star,\" \"Filibustero,\" and other such pests of the\r\ncommunity to gather round, being ready at any moment to start on a\r\nbuccaneering expedition, if they can only find another Lopez ass enough\r\nto lead them.\r\n\r\nConcha became governor-general just before Lopez' last expedition, and\r\nthe order for his execution was a most painful task for poor Concha, who\r\nhad been for many years an intimate friend of his. Concha appears to\r\nhave left an excellent name behind him. I always heard him called \"the\r\nhonest governor.\" He introduced a great many reforms into the civil\r\ncode, and established a great many schools and scientific and literary\r\nsocieties. During my stay in the island, his successor, Cañedo, was the\r\ngovernor-general. Whenever I made inquiries about him, the most\r\nfavourable answer I could get was, a chuck-up of the head, a slight\r\n\"p'tt\" with the lips, and an expression of the eyes indicating the sight\r\nof a most unpleasant object. The three combined required no dictionary\r\nof the Academy to interpret.[AB]\r\n\r\nThe future of this rich and lovely island, who can predict? It is talked\r\nof by its powerful neighbours as \"the sick man.\" Filibustero vultures\r\nhover above it as though it were already a putrid corpse inviting their\r\ndescent; young America points to it with the absorbing index of\r\n\"manifest destiny;\" gold is offered for it; Ostend conferences are held\r\nabout it; the most sober senators cry respecting it--\"Patience, when the\r\npear is ripe, it must drop into our lap.\" Old Spain--torn by faction,\r\nand ruined by corruption--supports its tottering treasury from it. Thus,\r\nplundered by friends, coveted by neighbours, and assailed by pirates, it\r\nlies like a helpless anatomical subject, with the ocean for a\r\ndissecting-table, on one side whereof stands a mother sucking its blood,\r\nand on the other \"Lone Stars\" gashing its limbs, while in the\r\nbackground, a young and vigorous republic is seen anxiously waiting for\r\nthe whole carcass. If I ask, \"Where shall vitality be sought?\" Echo\r\nanswers \"Where?\" If I ask, \"Where shall I look for hope?\" the very\r\nbreath of the question extinguishes the flickering taper. Who, then, can\r\nshadow forth the fate that is reserved for this tropical gem of the\r\nocean, where all around is so dark and louring?... A low voice, borne on\r\na western breeze, whispers in my ear--\"I guess I can.\"\r\n\r\nCuba, farewell!\r\n\r\n[Note: The subsequent squabbles between the Cuban authorities and the\r\nUnited States have taken place long since my departure, and are too\r\ncomplicated to enter into without more accurate information than I\r\npossess.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote X: I put up at \"The Havana House,\" where I found everything\r\nvery clean, and the proprietor, an American, very civil. It is now kept\r\nby his son.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote Y: This was written in January, 1853.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote Z: The Filibustero movement in the United States has caused\r\nSpain to increase her military force considerably.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AA: When first suspected of treason, he had been hunted with\r\ndogs like a wild beast, and, with considerable difficulty, escaped to\r\nAmerica.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AB: Those who desire more detailed information respecting Cuba\r\nwill find it in a work entitled _La Reine des Antilles_. Par LE VICOMTE\r\nGUSTAVE D'HARPONVILLE. 1850.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n_Change of Dynasty_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe month of February was drawing to a close, when I took my passage on\r\nboard the \"Isabel,\" bound for Charleston. A small coin removed all\r\ndifficulty about embarking luggage, cigars, &c.; the kettle was boiling,\r\nhands shook violently, bells rang rapidly, non-passengers flew down to\r\nshore-boats; round go the wheels, waving go the kerchiefs, and down fall\r\nthe tears. The \"Isabel\" bounds o'er the ripp'less waters; forts and\r\ndungeons, as we gaze astern, fade from the view; an indistinct shade is\r\nall by which the eye can recal the lovely isle of Cuba; and, lest memory\r\nshould fail, the piles of oranges, about four feet square, all round the\r\nupper-deck, are ready to refresh it. How different the \"Isabel\" from the\r\n\"Cherokee!\" Mr. Law might do well to take a cruise in the former; and,\r\nif he had any emulation, he would sell all his dirty old tubs for\r\nfirewood, and invest the proceeds in the \"Isabel\" style of vessel. Land\r\na-head!--a flourishing little village appears, with watch-towers high as\r\nminarets. What can all this mean?\r\n\r\nThis is a thriving, happy community, fixed on the most dreary and\r\nunhealthy-looking point imaginable, and deriving all their wealth and\r\nhappiness from the misfortunes of others. It is Key West, a village of\r\nwreckers, who, doubtless, pray earnestly for a continuance and increase\r\nof the changing currents, which are eternally drifting some ill-fated\r\nbarque on the ever-growing banks and coral reefs of these treacherous\r\nand dangerous waters; the lofty watch-towers are their Pisgah, and the\r\nstranded barques their Land of Promise. The sight of one is doubtless as\r\nrefreshing to their sight as the clustering grapes of Eschol were to the\r\nwandering Israelites of old. So thoroughly does the wrecking spirit\r\npervade this little community, that they remind one of the \"Old Joe\r\nMiller,\" which gives an account of a clergyman who, seeing all his\r\ncongregation rise from their seats at the joyous cry of, \"A wreck! a\r\nwreck!\" called them to order with an irresistible voice of thunder, and\r\ndeliberately commencing to despoil himself of his surplice, added,\r\n\"Gentlemen, a fair start, if you please!\"\r\n\r\nWe picked up a couple of captains here, whose ships had tasted these\r\nbitter waters, and who were on their road to New York to try and make\r\nthe best of a bad job. We had some very agreeable companions on board;\r\nbut we had others very much the contrary, conspicuous among whom was an\r\nundeniable Hebrew but no Nathanael. He was one of those pompous loud\r\ntalkers, whose every word and work bespoke vulgarity in its most\r\nobnoxious form, and whose obtuseness in matters of manners was so great\r\nthat nothing short of the point of your shoe could have made him\r\nunderstand how offensive he was. He spoke of courts in Europe, and of\r\nthe Vice-regal court in Ireland, as though he had the _entrée_ of them\r\nall; which it was palpable to the most superficial observer he never\r\ncould have had, except possibly when, armed with a dingy bag on his\r\nshoulder and an \"Ol clo'\" on his lips, he sought an investment in\r\ncast-off garments. He was taking cigars, which, from their quantity,\r\nwere evidently for sale; and as the American Government is very liberal\r\nin allowing passengers to enter cigars, never--I believe--refusing any\r\none the privilege of five hundred, he was beating up for friends who had\r\nno cigars to divide his speculations among, so as to avoid the duty; at\r\nlast his arrangements were completed, and his mind at ease.\r\n\r\nOn entering the port of Charleston he got up the box containing his\r\ntreasures, and was about to open it, when, to my intense delight and\r\namusement, an officer of the ship stayed his hasty hand. \"What's that\r\nfor?\" exclaimed the wrathful Israelite. \"I guess that box is in the\r\nmanifest,\" was the calm reply, \"and you can't touch it till it goes to\r\nthe custom-house.\" Jonathan had \"done\" the Hebrew; and besides the duty,\r\nhe had the pleasure of paying freight on them also; while, to add to his\r\nsatisfaction, he enjoyed the sight of all the other passengers taking\r\ntheir five hundred or so unmolested, while compelled to pay duty on\r\nevery cigar himself. But we must leave the Jew, the \"Isabel\"--ay,\r\nCharleston itself. \"Hurry hurry, bubble bubble, toil and trouble!\"\r\nWashington must be reached before the 4th of March, or we shall not see\r\nthe Senate and the other House in session. Steamer and rail; on we\r\ndash. The boiling horse checks his speed; the inconveniences of the\r\njourney are all forgotten: we are at Washington, and the all-absorbing\r\nthought is, \"Where shall we get a bed?\"\r\n\r\nMy companion[AC] and myself drove about from hotel to boarding-house,\r\nfrom boarding-house to hotel, and from hotel to the Capitol, seeking a\r\nresting-place in vain. Every chink and cranny was crammed; the\r\nreading-rooms of the hotels had from one to two dozen stretcher beds in\r\neach of them. 'Twas getting on for midnight; Hope's taper was flickering\r\nfaintly, when a police-officer came to the rescue, and recommended us to\r\ntry a small boarding-house at which he was himself lodging. There, as an\r\nespecial favour, we got two beds put into a room where another lodger\r\nwas already snoring; but fatigue and sleep soon obliterated that fact\r\nfrom our remembrance. Next morning, while lying in a half doze, I heard\r\nsomething like the upsetting of a jug near my bedside, and then, a sound\r\nlike mopping up; suspicious of my company, I opened my eyes, and lo!\r\nthere was the owner of the third bed, deliberately mopping up the\r\ncontents of the jug he had upset over the carpet, with--what do you\r\nthink? His handkerchief? oh, no--his coat-tails? oh, no--a spare towel?\r\noh, no; the savage, with the most placid indifference, was mopping it up\r\nwith my sponge! He expressed so much astonishment when I remonstrated,\r\nthat I supposed the poor man must have been in the habit of using his\r\nown sponge for such purposes, and my ire subsided gradually as he wrung\r\nout the sponge by an endless succession of vigorous squeezes,\r\naccompanying each with a word of apology. So much for my first night at\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nWe will pass over breakfast, and away to the Capitol. There it stands,\r\non a rising knoll, commanding an extensive panoramic view of the town\r\nand surrounding country. The building is on a grand scale, and faced\r\nwith marble, which, glittering in the sunbeams, gives it a very imposing\r\nappearance; but the increasing wants of this increasing Republic have\r\ncaused two wings to be added, which are now in the course of\r\nconstruction. Entrance to the Senate and House of Representatives was\r\nafforded to us with that readiness and courtesy which strangers\r\ninvariably experience. But, alas! the mighty spirits who had, by their\r\npower of eloquence, so often charmed and spell-bound the tenants of the\r\nsenate chamber--where were they? The grave had but recently closed over\r\nthe last of those giant spirits; Webster was no more! Like all similar\r\nbodies, they put off and put off, till, in the last few days of the\r\nsession, a quantity of business is hustled through, and thus no scope is\r\nleft for eloquent speeches; all is matter of fact, and a very\r\nbusiness-looking body they appeared, each senator with his desk and\r\npapers before him; and when anything was to be said, it was expressed in\r\nplain, unadorned language, and free from hesitation. The only\r\nopportunity offered for eloquence was, after the inauguration, on the\r\ndiscussion of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty. I will not say that the\r\nvenerable senator for Delaware--Mr. Clayton--was eloquent, but he was\r\nvery clear both in language and delivery, and his bearing altogether\r\nshowed the honest conviction of a man who knew he was in the right, and\r\nwas certain he would be ultimately so judged. His principal antagonist\r\nwas the senator for Illinois--Mr. Douglas--one of the stars of the Young\r\nAmerican party, and an aspirant to the presidential honours of the\r\nRepublic. He is a stout-built man, rather short, with a massive\r\noverhanging forehead. When he rose, he did so with the evident\r\nconsciousness that the gallery above him was filled with many of his\r\npolitical school, and thrusting both hands well into the bottom of his\r\nbreeches pockets, he commenced his oration with an air of great\r\nself-confidence, occasionally drawing one hand from its concealment to\r\naid his oratory by significant gesture. He made an excellent\r\nclap-trap--or, as they term it in America, Buncombe--speech, aiding and\r\nemphasizing, by energetic shakings of the forefinger, such passages as\r\nhe thought would tell in the gallery above; his voice was loud and\r\nclear, his language blunt and fluent, and amusingly replete with \"dares\r\nand daren't;\" \"England's in the wrong, and she knows it;\" if the\r\noriginal treaty, by which America was to have had the canal exclusively,\r\nhad been concluded, \"America would have had a rod to hold over all the\r\nnations.\" Then came \"manifest destiny;\" then the mare's nest called\r\n\"Monroe doctrine;\" then more Buncombe about England; and then ... he sat\r\ndown--satisfied, no doubt, that he had very considerably increased his\r\nchances for the \"tenancy of the White House.\"\r\n\r\nI regretted much not being able to hear Mr. Everett speak, for I believe\r\nhe is admitted on all hands to be the most eloquent and classical orator\r\nwithin the precincts of the senate at the present moment; but I was\r\nobliged to leave Washington before he addressed the assembly. The\r\nabsence of all signs of approbation or disapprobation, while a senator\r\nis addressing the House, gives a coldness to the debate, and I should\r\nthink must have a damping effect upon the enthusiasm of the speaker. The\r\n\"Hear hears\" and \"cheers\" of friends, and the \"Oh ohs\" or \"laughter\" of\r\nopponents, certainly give an air of much greater excitement to the\r\nscene, and act as an encouragement to the orator. But such exclamations\r\nare not allowed either in the Senate or the House of Representatives.\r\nThe chamber of the latter is of course much larger than that of the\r\nSenators, and, as far as I can judge, a bad room to hear in. When the\r\nnew wings are finished, they will move into one of them, and their\r\npresent chamber is, I believe, to be a library. I had no opportunity of\r\nhearing any of the oratory of this house, as they were merely hustling a\r\nfew money and minor bills through, previous to the inauguration, which\r\nclosed their session. They also have each a desk and chair; but with\r\ntheir increasing numbers I fear that any room large enough to afford\r\nthem such accommodation must be bad for speaking in.--Let us now turn to\r\nthe great event of the day, i.e., the Inauguration.\r\n\r\nThe senators are all in their places; ministers of foreign Powers and\r\ntheir suites are seated on the row of benches under the gallery; the\r\nexpectant masses are waiting outside; voices are suddenly hushed, and\r\nall eyes turned towards the door of the senate-chamber; the herald walks\r\nin, and says, \"The President Elect of the United States.\" The chosen of\r\nhis country appears with as little form or ceremony as a gentleman\r\nwalking into an ordinary drawing-room. All rise as he enters.\r\n\r\nI watched the man of the day as he proceeded to his seat on the floor\r\nof the senate. There was neither pride in his eye nor nervousness in his\r\nstep, but a calm and dignified composure, well fitted to his high\r\nposition, as though gratified ambition were duly tempered by a deep\r\nsense of responsibility. The procession moved out in order to a platform\r\nin front of the Capitol, the late able president walking side by side\r\nwith his untried successor, and apparently as calm in resigning office\r\nas his successor appeared to be in entering upon it. Of the inaugural\r\nspeech I shall say nothing, as all who care to read it have done so long\r\nsince. But one thing should always be remembered, and that is, that the\r\npopular candidates here are all compelled to \"do a little Buncombe,\" and\r\ntherefore, under the circumstances, I think it must be admitted there\r\nwas as little as was possible. That speech tolled the knell, for the\r\npresent at least, of the Whig party, and ushered in the reign of General\r\nPierce and the Democrats.\r\n\r\nSince these lines were penned, the \"chosen of the nation\" has passed\r\nthrough his ordeal of four years' administration; and, whatever private\r\nvirtues may have adorned his character, I imagine the unanimous voice of\r\nhis countrymen would unhesitatingly declare, that so utterly inefficient\r\na man never filled the presidential chair. He has been succeeded by Mr.\r\nBuchanan, who was well known as the accredited Minister to the Court of\r\nSt. James's, and who also made himself ludicrously conspicuous as one of\r\nthe famous Ostend manifesto party. However, his talents are undoubted,\r\nand his public career renders it probable that, warned by the failure of\r\nhis predecessor, his presidency will reflect more credit upon the\r\nRepublic than that of Mr. Pierce. Mr. B.'s inaugural address has been\r\npublished in this country, and is, in its way, a contradictory\r\ncuriosity. He urges, in diplomacy, \"frankness and clearness;\" while, to\r\nhis fellow-citizens, he offers some very wily diplomatic sentences.\r\nMunroe doctrine and manifest destiny are not named; but they are\r\nshadowed forth in language worthy of a Talleyrand. First, he glories in\r\nhis country having never extended its territory by the sword(?); he then\r\nproceeds to say--what everybody says in anticipation of conquest,\r\nannexation, or absorption--\"Our past history forbids that, in future, we\r\nshould acquire territory, unless this be sanctioned by the laws of\r\njustice and honour\" (two very elastic laws among nations). \"Acting on\r\nthis principle, no nation will have a right to interfere, or to\r\ncomplain if, in the progress of events, we shall still further extend\r\nour possessions.\" Leaving these frank and clear sentences to the\r\nconsideration of the reader, we return from the digression.\r\n\r\nThe crowd outside was very orderly, but by no means so numerous as I had\r\nexpected; I estimated them at 8000; but a friend who was with me, and\r\nwell versed in such matters, calculated the numbers at nearly 10,000,\r\nbut certainly, he said, not more. The penny Press, by way of doing\r\nhonour to their new ruler, boldly fixed the numbers at 40,000--that was\r\ntheir bit of Buncombe. One cause, probably, of the crowd not being\r\ngreater, was the drizzling snow, which doubtlessly induced many to be\r\nsatisfied with seeing the procession pass along Pennsylvania Avenue.\r\n\r\nI cannot help remarking here, how little some of their eminent men know\r\nof England. A senator, of great and just reputation, came to me during\r\nthe ceremony, and said, \"There is one thing which must strike you as\r\nvery remarkable, and that is, that we have no soldiers here to keep\r\norder upon an occasion of such political importance.\" He was evidently\r\nunaware that, not only was such the case invariably in England, but that\r\nsoldiers are confined to barracks, or even removed during the excitement\r\nof elections. There is no doubt that the falsehoods and exaggerations\r\nwith which the Press here teems, in matters referring to England, are\r\nsufficiently glaring to be almost self-confuting; but if they can so\r\nwarp the mind of an enlightened senator, how is it to be wondered at\r\nthat, among the masses, many suck in all such trash as if it were Gospel\r\ntruth, and look upon England as little else than a land of despotism;\r\nbut of that, more anon. The changing of presidents in this country\r\nresembles, practically speaking, the changing of a premier in England;\r\nbut, thank Heaven! the changing of a premier in England does not involve\r\nthe same changes as does the changing of a president here.\r\n\r\nI believe it was General Jackson who first introduced the practice of a\r\nwholesale sweeping out of opponents from all situations, however small;\r\nand this bright idea has been religiously acted upon by all succeeding\r\npresidents. The smallest clerkships, twopenny-halfpenny postmasterships\r\nin unheard-of villages--all, all that can be dispensed with, must make\r\nway for the friends of the incomers to power. Fancy a new premier in\r\nEngland making a clean sweep of nine-tenths of the clerks, &c., at the\r\nTreasury, Foreign-office, Post-office, Custom-house, Dockyards, &c., &c.\r\nConceive the jobbing such a system must lead to, not to mention the\r\ncomparative inefficiency it must produce in the said departments, and\r\nthe ridiculous labour it throws upon the dispensers of these gifts of\r\nplace. The following quotation may be taken as a sample:--\r\n\r\n  OUR CUSTOM-HOUSE--WHAT A HAUL.--The _New Hampshire Patriot_, in an\r\n  article on proscription, thus refers to the merciless decapitation of\r\n  the Democrats of our Custom-house, by Mr. Collector Maxwell:--\r\n\r\n  \"Take the New York Custom-house as a sample. There are 626 officers\r\n  there, exclusive of labourers; and it appears from the records that,\r\n  since the Whigs came into power, 427 removals have been there made.\r\n  And to show the greediness of the Whig applicants for the spoils, it\r\n  need only be stated that, on the very day the collector was sworn into\r\n  office he made forty-two removals. He made six before he was sworn. In\r\n  thirty days from the time of his entrance upon his duties he removed\r\n  220 persons; and, in the course of a few months, he had made such a\r\n  clean sweep, that only sixty-two Democrats remained in office, with\r\n  564 Whigs! A like sweep was made in other custom-houses; and so clean\r\n  work did this 'anti-proscription' administration make in the offices,\r\n  that a Democrat could scarcely be found in an office which a Whig\r\n  could be found to take.\"\r\n\r\n  This is ominous, for the 564 Whigs to be turned over to the charity of\r\n  the new collector. Alas! the Democrats are hungry--hard shells and\r\n  soft shells--and charity begins at home. In the course of the coming\r\n  month we may anticipate a large emigration from the custom-house to\r\n  California and Australia. What a blessing to ejected office-holders\r\n  that they can fall back upon the gold mines! Such is the beautiful\r\n  working of our beneficent institutions! What a magnificent country!\r\n\r\nAs a proof of the excitement which these changes produce, I remember\r\nperfectly there being ten to one more fuss and telegraphing between\r\nWashington and New York, as to who should be collector at the latter\r\nport, than would exist between London and Paris if a revolution was in\r\nfull swing at the latter. To this absurd system may no doubt be partly\r\nattributed the frequent irregularities of their inland postage; but it\r\nis an evil which, as far as I can judge from observation and\r\nconversation, will continue till, with an increasing population and\r\nincrease of business, necessity re-establishes the old and better order\r\nof things. Political partisanship is so strong that nothing but\r\nimperative necessity can alter it.\r\n\r\nThe cabmen here, as in every other place I ever visited, make strenuous\r\nefforts to do the new comers. They tried it on me; so, to show them how\r\nknowing I was, I quoted their legitimate fares. \"Ah, sir,\" says Cabby,\r\n\"that's very well; but, you see, we charges more at times like these.\" I\r\nreplied, \"You've no right to raise your charges; by what authority do\r\nyou do it?\" \"Oh, sir, we meet together and agree what is the proper\r\nthing.\" \"But,\" says I, \"the authorities are the people to settle those\r\nthings.\" \"The authorities don't know nothing at all about it; we can\r\nmanage our own matters better than they.\" And they all stoutly stuck to\r\ntheir own charges, the effect of which was that I scarcely saw a dozen\r\ncabs employed during the ten days I was there.\r\n\r\nNothing could exceed the crowd in the streets, in the hotels, and\r\neverywhere; the whole atmosphere was alive with the smoke of the\r\nfragrant weed, and all the hotels were afloat with the juice thereof.\r\nThe city has repeatedly been called the City of Magnificent Distances;\r\nbut anything so far behind its fellow cities cannot well be imagined. It\r\nsounds incredible--nevertheless, it is a fact--that, except from the\r\nCapitol to the \"White House,\" there is not a street-light of any kind,\r\nor a watchman. I lost my way one evening, and wandered all over the town\r\nfor two hours, without seeing light or guardian of any kind. I suppose\r\nthis is intended as a proof of the honest and orderly conduct of the\r\ninhabitants, but I fear it must also be taken as a proof of their\r\npoverty or want of energy. Whatever the reason may be, it certainly is a\r\nreflection on the liberality of the Government, that the capital of this\r\nGreat Union should be the worst paved, worst lit, and worst guarded in\r\nthe whole Republic.\r\n\r\nThe system of sweeping changes on the election of a new president tends\r\nmaterially to stop any increase of householders, the uncertain tenure of\r\noffice making the _employés_ prefer clustering in hotels and\r\nboarding-houses to entering on a short career of housekeeping, which\r\nwill, of course, militate against any steady increase of the city, and\r\nthus diminish the tax-payers. There are several hotels, but they will\r\nnot stand the least comparison with those in any of the leading towns of\r\nthe Union. Like the hotels in London, they are crammed during the\r\nseason--i.e., session--and during the rest of the year are\r\ncomparatively empty, and consequently do not pay very well; but they\r\nare not the only establishments that make hay during the session; if\r\nreport speaks truly, the bars and gambling-houses reap an immense\r\nharvest from the representatives of the people in both houses of\r\ncongress.\r\n\r\nI amused myself here, as I often had done in other towns, by taking a\r\ncigar in some decent-looking shop, and then having a chat with the\r\nowner. On this occasion the subject of conversation was drinking in the\r\nStates. He said, in reply to a question I put to him, \"Sir, a gentleman\r\nmust live a long time in the country before he can form the slightest\r\nidea of the frightful extent to which drinking is carried, even by the\r\ndecently educated and well-to-do classes. I do not say that nine-tenths\r\nof the people die drunk, but I firmly believe that with that proportion\r\ndeath has been very materially hastened from perpetual drinks. It is one\r\nof the greatest curses of this country, and I cannot say that I believe\r\nit to be on the decrease.\" One reason, doubtless, why it is so\r\npernicious, is the constant habit of drinking before breakfast. That he\r\nwas correct in his per-centage, I do not pretend to say; but I certainly\r\nhave seen enough of the practice to feel sure it must have a most\r\npernicious effect on very many. To what extent it is carried on by the\r\nlowest classes I had no opportunity of judging.\r\n\r\nThe following observations, however, made by so high an authority as Mr.\r\nEverett, must be admitted as a convincing proof that education has not\r\nbeen able to cope effectually with drunkenness. Speaking of ardent\r\nspirits, he says:--\r\n\r\n  \"What has it done in ten years in the States of America? First, it has\r\n  cost the nation a direct expense of 120,000,000l. Secondly, it has\r\n  cost the nation an indirect expense of 120,000,000l. Thirdly, it has\r\n  destroyed 300,000 lives. Fourthly, it has sent 100,000 children to the\r\n  poor-house. Fifthly, it has consigned at least 150,000 persons to\r\n  jails and penitentiaries. Sixthly, it has made at least a thousand\r\n  maniacs. Seventhly, it has instigated to the commission of at least\r\n  fifteen hundred murders. Eighthly, it has caused 2000 persons to\r\n  commit suicide. Ninthly, it has burnt or otherwise destroyed property\r\n  to the amount of 2,000,000l. Tenthly, it has made 200,000 widows,\r\n  and 1,000,000 of orphan children.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I turn from the contemplation of this sad picture, and think how\r\nmany fall victims to the same vice in my own country, I cannot help\r\nfeeling that the \"myriad-minded poet\" wrote the following lines as an\r\nespecial warning and legacy to the Anglo-Saxon and the Celt:--\r\n\r\n  \"Oh, that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their\r\n  brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause,\r\n  transform ourselves into beasts!\"\r\n\r\nI was very sorry time did not admit of my witnessing one of the new\r\npresident's levees, as I much wished to see the olla podrida of\r\nattendants. It must be a quaint scene; the hack-cabman who drives you to\r\nthe door will get a boy to look after his shay, and go in with you;\r\ntag-rag and bob-tail, and all their family, go in precisely as they\r\nlike; neither soap nor brush is a necessary prelude. By late accounts\r\nfrom America, it appears that at Mr. Pierce's last levee a gentleman\r\ncharged another with picking his pocket: the latter went next day with a\r\nfriend to explain the mistake, which the former refusing to accept, he\r\nwas struck by the accused, and, in return, shot him dead on the spot. A\r\npleasant state of society for the metropolis of a civilized community!\r\nHow changed since the days of Washington and knee-breeches! It should\r\nhowever be mentioned as highly creditable to the masses, that they\r\nrarely take advantage of their rights. The building is the size of a\r\nmoderately wealthy country gentleman's house in England, and has one or\r\ntwo fine reception-rooms; between it and the water a monument is being\r\nraised to Washington. I fear it will be a sad failure; the main shaft or\r\ncolumn suggests the idea of a semaphore station, round the base whereof\r\nthe goodly things of sculpture are to be clustered. As far as I could\r\nglean from conversation with Americans, they seem themselves to\r\nanticipate anything but success.\r\n\r\nThe finest buildings here are the Capitol, Patent-office, and\r\nPost-office. Of these the Patent-office, which is modelled after the\r\nParthenon, is the only one that has any pretensions to architecture. I\r\nfear the Anglo-Saxon of these later days, whether in the old country or\r\nhere, is destined to leave no solid traces of architectural\r\ntaste--_vide_ National Gallery, London, and Post-office, Washington.\r\n\r\nHaving seen the lions of Washington, and enjoyed the hospitalities of\r\nour able and agreeable minister, I again trusted myself to the iron\r\nhorse, and started for Baltimore. During my residence in Washington, I\r\nhad revelled latterly in the comfort of a lodging free from the horrors\r\nof American inns. Profiting by this experience, I had applied to a\r\nfriend at Baltimore to engage me rooms in some quiet place there; by\r\nthis precaution I got into Guy's, in Monument-square. He keeps a\r\nrestaurant, but has a few beds for friends or old customers. I found\r\nmyself most comfortably housed, and the living of the cleanest and the\r\nbest; besides which, my kind friends gave me the _entrée_ of the Club,\r\nwhich was almost next door. The hospitalities of which I had enjoyed a\r\nforetaste in November last, now thickened upon me, and though the season\r\nof Lent had put a stop to large and general parties, enough was still\r\nleft to make my stay very agreeable.\r\n\r\nThe town is beautifully situated on undulating ground, commanding a\r\nlovely view of the hay; the streets are of a rational breadth, the town\r\nis rapidly increasing, the new buildings are all large and airy, and\r\neverything indicates prosperity. The cuisine of Baltimore has a very\r\nhigh, and, as far as I can judge, a very just reputation; not merely\r\nMaxwell Point canvas-back ducks, but the famous Terrapin also, lend\r\ntheir aid to the enjoyment of the inner man. In fact, so famous is the\r\nTerrapin, that a wicked wag detailed to me an account of a highly\r\nimproper scene which he said took place once in the Episcopal Church\r\nhere, viz., a gentleman who had a powerful voice and generally led the\r\nresponses, had his heart and mind so full of the luscious little animal,\r\nthat by a sad fatality he substituted \"Terrapin\" for \"Seraphin\" in the\r\nresponse; and so far was any one from remarking it, that the whole\r\ncongregation repeated the mistake after him. The curly twinkle in the\r\neye with which my friend told me the story, leaves an impression in my\r\nmind that it may be an exaggeration.\r\n\r\nWhile here, I observed a play-bill with \"The White Slave of England\"\r\nprinted on it, evidently intended as a set-off against the dramatizing\r\nof \"Uncle Tom\" in London, at some of our penny theatres. Of course I\r\nwent to see it, and never laughed more in all my life.\r\n\r\nThe theatre was about the size of a six-stalled stable, and full of\r\nrowdies, &c.--no ladies; our party had a private-box. The tragedy opens\r\nby revealing the under-ground of a coal-pit in England, where is seen a\r\nfainting girl, &c. &c.: the girl is, of course, well licked by a driver;\r\nan explosion takes place; dead and dying bodies are heaped together,\r\nthe driver says, \"D---- 'em, let 'em lie; we'll get plenty more from the\r\npoor-house.\" These mines belong to a Lord Overstone; an American arrives\r\nwith a negro servant, whom he leaves to seek his own amusement. He then\r\ncalls on Lord Overstone, and obtains permission to visit the mines;\r\nthere he finds the girl alluded to above all but dying, and, of course,\r\nrescues her. In the meantime, the nigger calls on Lord Overstone as a\r\nforeign prince, is immensely _fêted_, the Duchess of Southernblack and\r\nher friend Lady Cunning are invited to meet his Royal Highness; the\r\nrescued girl is claimed as a slave by Lord Overstone; philanthropic\r\nJonathan, after some difficulty, succeeds in keeping her, having first\r\nordered Lord Overstone's servants to the right-about with all the\r\nswagger of a northern negro-driver. It appears that Jonathan was\r\nformerly a boy in the mines himself, and had conceived an affection for\r\nthis girl. Lord Overstone finds out that Jonathan has papers requisite\r\nfor him to prove his right to his property; he starts with his family\r\nfor America, to visit him on his plantation. There the niggers exhibit a\r\nparadise such as never was; nearly the first person is his Royal\r\nHighness the nigger servant. Lady Overstone faints when he comes up to\r\nshake hands. Business proceeds; Lord Overstone bullies,--Jonathan is the\r\nmilk of mildness. At last it turns out the girl is a daughter of Lord\r\nOverstone, and that the Yankee is the owner by right of Lord Overstone's\r\nproperty. He delivers a Buncombe speech, resigning his rights, and\r\nenlarging on the higher privilege of being in the land of true\r\nfreedom--a slave plantation. The audience scream frantically, Lord and\r\nLady Overstone go back humbled, and the curtain falls on one of the most\r\nabsurd farces I ever saw; not the least absurd part being Jonathan\r\nrefusing to take possession of his inheritance of 17,000l. a-year.\r\nTruly, \"Diogenes in his tub\" is nothing to \"Jonathan in his sugar-cask.\"\r\n\r\nThe population of Maryland has increased in whites and free negroes, and\r\ndecreased in slaves, between the years 1800 and 1852, in the following\r\nmanner:--\r\n\r\n         Whites.  Free Negroes.  Slaves.\r\n  1800   216,000      8,000      103,000\r\n  1852   500,000     74,008       90,000.\r\n\r\nThe state has nearly a thousand educational establishments; and there\r\nare sixty daily and weekly papers for the instruction of the community.\r\nBaltimore has a population of 140,000 whites, 25,000 free blacks, 3000\r\nslaves. Among this population are nearly 30,000 Germans and 20,000\r\nIrish. The value of the industrial establishments of the city is\r\nestimated at considerably above 4,000,000l. From the above, I leave\r\nthe reader to judge of its prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe people in Baltimore who enjoy the widest--if not the most\r\nenviable--reputation, are the fire companies. They are all volunteer,\r\nand their engines are admirable. They are all jealous as Kilkenny cats\r\nof one another, and when they come together, they scarcely ever lose an\r\nopportunity of getting up a bloody fight. They are even accused of doing\r\noccasionally a little bit of arson, so as to get the chance of a row.\r\nThe people composing the companies are almost entirely rowdies, and\r\napparently of any age above sixteen: when extinguishing fires, they\r\nexhibit a courage and reckless daring that cannot be surpassed, and they\r\nare never so happy as when the excitement of danger is at its highest.\r\nTheir numbers are so great, that they materially affect the elections of\r\nall candidates for city offices; the style of persons chosen, may hence\r\nbe easily guessed. The cup of confusion is fast filling up; and unless\r\nsome knowing hands can make a hole in the bottom and drain off the\r\ndregs, the overflow will be frightful.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote AC: I had had the good fortune to pick up an agreeable\r\ncompanion on board the \"Isabel\"--the brother of one of our most\r\ndistinguished members of the House of Commons--who, like myself, had\r\nbeen visiting Cuba, and was hastening to Washington, to be present at\r\nthe inauguration of the President Elect, and with him I spent many very\r\npleasant days.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n_Philadelphia and Richmond_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving spent a very pleasant time at Baltimore, I took rail for\r\nPhiladelphia, the city of \"loving brotherhood,\" being provided with\r\nletters to several most amiable families in that town. I took up my\r\nabode at Parkinson's--a restaurant in Chestnut-street--where I found the\r\npeople very civil and the house very clean; but I saw little of the\r\ninside of the house, except at bed and breakfast time. The hospitality\r\nfor which this city is proverbial soon made me as much at home as if I\r\nhad been a resident there all my life. Dinner-party upon dinner-party\r\nsucceeded each other like waves of the ocean; the tables groaned under\r\nprecious vintages of Madeira, dating back all but to the Flood. I have\r\nnever before or since tasted such delicious wine, and in such profusion,\r\nand everybody stuck to it with such leech-like tenacity. On one\r\noccasion, having sat down to dinner at two o'clock, I found myself\r\ngetting up from table half an hour after midnight, and quite as fresh as\r\nwhen I had sat down. There was no possibility of leaving the hospitable\r\nold General's mahogany.[AD] One kind friend, Mr. C.H. Fisher, insisted\r\nthat I must make his house my hotel, either he or his wife were always\r\nat dinner at four o'clock, and my cover was always laid. The society of\r\nhis amiable lady and himself made it too tempting an offer to refuse,\r\nand I need scarcely say, it added much to the pleasure of my stay in\r\nPhiladelphia. The same kind friend had also a seat for me always in his\r\nbox at the opera, where that most charming and lady-like of actresses,\r\nthe Countess Rossi,[AE] with her sweet voice, was gushing forth\r\nsoft melody to crammed houses. On every side I met nothing but\r\nkindness. Happening one day at dinner to mention incidentally, that I\r\nthought the butter unworthy of the reputation of Philadelphia--for it\r\nprofesses to stand pre-eminent in dairy produce--two ladies present\r\nexclaimed, \"Well!\" and accompanied the expression by a look of active\r\nbenevolence. The next morning, as I was sitting down to breakfast, a\r\nplate arrived from each of the rivals in kindness; the dew of the\r\nmorning was on the green leaf, and underneath, such butter as my mouth\r\nwaters at the remembrance of, and thus it continued during my whole\r\nstay. The club doors, with all its conveniences--and to a solitary\r\nstranger they are very great--were thrown open to me: in short, my\r\nfriends left me nothing to wish, except that my time had permitted me a\r\nlonger enjoyment of their hospitalities.\r\n\r\nThe streets of Philadelphia, which run north and south from the\r\nSchuylkill to the Delaware, are named after the trees, a row whereof\r\ngrow on each side; but whether from a poetic spirit, or to aid the\r\nmemory, some of the names are changed, that the following couplet,\r\nembracing the eight principal ones, may form a handy guide to the\r\nstranger or the resident:--\r\n\r\n  \"Chestnut, walnut, spruce, and pine,\r\n  Market, arch, race, and vine.\"\r\n\r\nMulberry, and sassafras, and juniper, would have dished the poetry. The\r\ncross-streets are all called by numbers; thus any domicile is readily\r\nfound. The principal traverse street is an exception, being called\r\n\"Broad;\" it looks its name well, and extends beyond the town into the\r\ncountry: strange as it may seem to those who associate stiff white\r\nbonnets, stiff coat-collars, and broad-brimmed hats, with Philadelphia,\r\non the extremity of this street every Sunday afternoon, all the famous\r\ntrotters may be seen dashing along at three-minute pace. The country\r\nround about is pretty and undulating, and the better-to-do inhabitants\r\nof Philadelphia have very snug little country places, in which they\r\nchiefly reside during the summer, and to which, at other seasons, they\r\noften adjourn upon the Saturday, to enjoy the quiet of Sunday in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nOne of the first objects of interest I went to visit was the Mint, the\r\nlabours of which are of course immensely increased since the working of\r\nthe Californian mines. Men are coming in every day with gold in greater\r\nor lesser quantities; it is first assayed, and the per-centage for this\r\nwork being deducted, the value is paid in coin to the owner. While I was\r\nthere, I saw a wiry-looking fellow arrive, in bright hat and brighter\r\nsatin waistcoat, with a beard as bushy as an Indian jungle, and as red\r\nas the furnace into which his precious burden was to be thrown. Two\r\nsmall leather bags were carefully taken out of a waist-belt, their\r\ncontents emptied into a tin can, a number placed in the can, and a\r\ncorresponding number given him--no words spoken: in two days he would\r\nreturn, and, producing his number, receive value in coin. The dust would\r\nall have gone into a good-sized coffee-cup. I asked the officer about\r\nthe value. \"400l., sir.\" He had left a New England state some eight\r\nmonths previous, and was going home to invest in land.\r\n\r\nWhat strikes a stranger most on entering the Mint, is the absence of all\r\nextra defence round it; the building appears as open as any London\r\nhouse. The process is, of course, essentially the same as elsewhere; but\r\nI was astonished when the director told me that the parties employed in\r\nthe establishment are never searched on leaving, though the value of\r\nhundreds of thousands of dollars is daily passing through their hands in\r\nevery shape. The water in which the workmen wash their hands runs into a\r\ntank below, and from this water, value to the amount of from 60l. to\r\n80l. is extracted annually. The sweepings, &c., after the most careful\r\nsifting, are packed in casks and sold--chiefly, I believe, to European\r\nJews--for 4000l. annually. The only peculiarity in the Philadelphian\r\nMint is a frame-work for counting the number of pieces coined, by which\r\ningenious contrivance--rendered necessary by Californian pressure--one\r\nman does the work of from twenty to thirty. The operation of weighing\r\nthe several pieces of coin being of a delicate nature, it is confided to\r\nthe hands of the fair sex, who occupy a room to themselves, where each\r\ndaughter of Eve sits with the gravity of a Chancellor opposite a\r\ndelicate pair of scales. Most parts of the establishment are open to the\r\npublic from ten till two, and they are only excluded from those portions\r\nof the building where intrusion would impede the operations in progress.\r\n\r\nThis city, like most others in America, is liberally supplied with\r\nwater. Magnificent basins are built in a natural mound at Fairmount,\r\nnearly opposite an old family mansion of the Barings, and the water is\r\nforced up into these basins from the river by powerful water-wheels,\r\nworked by the said river, which is dammed up for the purpose of\r\nobtaining sufficient fall, as the stream is sometimes very low.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting, and certainly the most imposing sight in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Philadelphia, is \"The Gerard College.\" So singular\r\nand successful a career as that of the founder deserves a slight record.\r\n\r\nStephen Gerard was born of French parents, at Bordeaux, the 21st of May,\r\n1750, and his home--owing to his mother's place having soon been filled\r\nby a step-mother--appears to have left no pleasant reminiscences. At\r\nfourteen years of age he took to the sea. Subsequently, as master and\r\npart owner of a small vessel, he arrived, in the year 1777, at\r\nPhiladelphia for the first time, and commenced business as a merchant;\r\nbut it appears that in 1786, he took command of one of his own vessels,\r\nleaving the management of his mercantile house to his brother. Returning\r\nin 1788, he dissolved partnership with his brother, and bade a final\r\nadieu to the sea. In the year 1793, the yellow fever raged with fury at\r\nPhiladelphia; as the ravage increased, the people fled aghast. A\r\nhospital was organized at Bush Hill, in the neighbourhood, but all was\r\nconfusion, for none could be found to face the dreaded enemy, till\r\nStephen Gerard and Peter Helm boldly volunteered their services at the\r\nrisk of their lives. Stephen Gerard was married, but his wife was\r\nconsigned to an asylum in 1790, after various ineffectual efforts for\r\nher cure; there she remained till her death, in 1815. His mercantile\r\npursuits prospered in every direction, and he soon became one of the\r\nmost wealthy and influential men in the community; he was possessed of a\r\nvigorous constitution, and was extremely regular and abstemious in his\r\nhabits. In 1830 he was knocked down by a passing vehicle as he was\r\ncrossing the street; by this accident he was severely injured in the\r\nhead, from which he was slowly recovering, when, in 1831, he was seized\r\nwith violent influenza, and ultimately pneumonia, of which he died, the\r\n26th of December, aged eighty-one.\r\n\r\nHis character appears to have been a curious compound. The assiduity\r\nwith which he amassed wealth, coupled with his abstemious habits, and\r\nhis old knee-breeches patched all over--and still to be seen in the\r\ncollege--strongly bespoke the miser; while his contributions to public\r\nworks, and his liberal transactions in money matters, led to an opposite\r\nconclusion; and from his noble conduct during the yellow fever it is\r\nreasonable to infer he was a humane man. I do not wish to judge people\r\nuncharitably, but, I must say, I can allow but little credit to a man\r\nwho legacies the bulk of his fortune away from his relations when he can\r\nno longer enjoy it himself. Mr. Gerard had very many relatives; let us\r\nsee how he provided for them. The _résumé_ of his will may be thus\r\nstated: he died worth 1,500,000l., and thus disposes of it:--\r\n\r\n  Erection and endowment of college        £400,000\r\n  Different institutions of charity          23,200\r\n  To his relatives and next of kin           28,000\r\n  City of Philadelphia, for improvements    100,000\r\n  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, for\r\n    internal improvements                    60,000\r\n  Sundry friends, &c.                        13,000\r\n\r\nThe residue left to the city of Philadelphia, for improvement and\r\nmaintenance of his college, the establishment of better police, and to\r\nimprove the city and diminish taxation. Thus, out of a fortune of one\r\nmillion and a half, he leaves his relatives 28,000l. Charity, in this\r\ninstance, can scarcely be said to have begun at home.\r\n\r\nA certain increase of property to the amount of 60,000l. having taken\r\nplace since the date of his will, a suit was instituted by the\r\nheirs-at-law to recover the same; in which, I am happy to say, they were\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most extraordinary clauses in his will is the\r\nfollowing, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\"_I enjoin and require that no ecclesiastic, missionary, or Minister of\r\nany sect whatsoever, shall ever hold or exercise any station or duty\r\nwhatever in the said college; nor shall any such person ever be admitted\r\nfor any purpose, or as a visitor, within the premises appropriated to\r\nthe purposes of the said college._\"\r\n\r\nThe general design of the college is taken from the Madeleine.\r\nThirty-four columns surround it, each column six feet in diameter and\r\nfifty feet high, made of marble, and weighing 103 tons, and costing when\r\nplaced 2600l. Some idea of the massiveness of the building may be\r\nformed from the fact that, measuring 111 feet by 169 feet, and 59 of\r\nheight, the weight of material employed is estimated at 76,594-1/2 tons.\r\nThe effect of the whole is grand and graceful; and although as an orphan\r\nasylum much money has been needlessly turned from its charitable uses,\r\nas a building it does credit to the architect and all employed upon it,\r\nand is, beyond all comparison, the best specimen of architecture I have\r\nseen in the States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gerard College, Philadelphia]\r\n\r\nThe number of orphans receiving instruction is three hundred and one;\r\nthey are cleanly and comfortably lodged, and well-boarded; their ages\r\naverage from ten to fourteen and a half, and the upper classes of the\r\nschool are taught conic sections, geometry, chemistry, natural\r\nphilosophy, navigation, astronomy, mechanics, physical geography, &c.\r\n\r\nWhile in the school vein, I visited one appropriated to four hundred\r\nfree negroes, whom I found of all ages, from five to fifty, males and\r\nfemales being kept separate. The master told me that he found the boys\r\ntolerably sharp, but very cunning, and always finding some excuse for\r\nirregular attendance. The mistress said she found the girls very docile,\r\nand the parents very anxious, but too soon satisfied with the first\r\nstages of progress. The patience and pains I saw one of the teachers\r\nexhibiting in the process of enlightening the little woolly heads was\r\nmost creditable.\r\n\r\nHaving finished the negro school, I got a letter to the principal of the\r\nHigh School, Professor Hart, by whom I was kindly shown over that\r\nadmirable institution, which is also free; but, before proceeding to any\r\nobservations on the High School, it may be interesting to know something\r\nof the entire provision for instruction which exists in the city and\r\ncounty of Philadelphia. The number of schools is 256, teachers 727,\r\nscholars 45,383. The teachers are principally females--646; of scholars,\r\nthe males rather preponderate. The annual expense of these\r\nestablishments is 66,500l., and the average cost of each pupil is\r\n26s. No pupil can be admitted into the High School without producing\r\nsatisfactory testimonials from the inferior schools, as well as passing\r\nthe requisite examination; the consequence of this arrangement is a vast\r\nimprovement in the inferior schools, as bad conduct there would\r\neffectually bar their entry to the High School. The average age of\r\nentry is fourteen, and a lad is required to stay five years before he\r\ncan take his degree as Master of Arts, one indispensable requisite for\r\nwhich is moral character. The school numbers about 500 of all kinds and\r\npositions in society, from the hopes of the tinsmith to the heir of the\r\ntoga'd judge.\r\n\r\nThe instruction is of so high an order that no private establishment can\r\ncompete with it; in short, it may be said to embrace a very fair college\r\neducation. Read the following list of professors: the Principal, who is\r\nalso Professor of Moral, Mental, and Political Science; Professor of\r\nPractical Mathematics; of Theoretical Science and Astronomy; of History\r\nand Belles-Lettres; of Natural History; of Latin and Greek; of French\r\nand Spanish; of Drawing, Writing, and Book-keeping; of Chemistry and\r\nNatural Philosophy; and three assistants. The highest salary received by\r\nthese professors is 270l. a-year, except that of Mr. Hart the\r\nPrincipal, which is 400l.; and in him all the responsibilities centre.\r\nThis is the only school where I ever knew the old Saxon regularly\r\ntaught. Instruction is given in various other studies not enumerated in\r\nthe Professors' list; thus, in the class under the Professor of Natural\r\nHistory, botany, and anatomy, and such medical information as may be\r\nuseful on any of the emergencies of every-day life are taught. No books\r\nare brought to this class; the instruction is entirely by lecture, and\r\nthe subjects treated are explained by beautifully-executed\r\ntransparencies, placed before a window by day, and before a bright jet\r\nof gas by night, and thus visible easily to all. The readiness with\r\nwhich I heard the pupils in this class answer the questions propounded\r\nto them showed the interest they took in the subject, and was a\r\nconclusive proof of the efficiency of the system of instruction pursued;\r\nthey dived into the arcana of human and vegetable life with an ease that\r\nbore the most satisfactory testimony to the skill of the instructor and\r\nthe attention of the pupils.\r\n\r\nThere is a plan adopted at this school which I never saw before, and\r\nwhich Professor Hart told me was most admirable in its results. At the\r\nend of every three-quarters of an hour all the doors and windows in the\r\nhouse are opened simultaneously; the bell is then rung twice: at the\r\nfirst sound, all lectures, recitations, and exercises cease, and the\r\nstudents put their books, caps, &c., in readiness to move; at the second\r\nsound, all the classes move simultaneously from the room in which they\r\nhave been studying to the room in which the next course of study is to\r\nbe followed. The building is so arranged, that in passing from one room\r\nto another, they have to pass through the court round the house. This\r\noperation takes three minutes, and is repeated about eight times a-day,\r\nduring which intervals all the doors and windows are open, thus\r\nthoroughly ventilating the rooms; but there is a further advantage,\r\nwhich is thus described in the Report,--\"These movements are found very\r\nuseful in giving periodically a fresh impulse both to the bodies and to\r\nthe minds of the students, and in interrupting almost mechanically the\r\ndull monotony which is apt to befall school hours.\" The Principal told\r\nme, that, from careful observation, he looked upon this as one of the\r\nmost valuable regulations in the establishment, and that it was\r\ndifficult to rate its advantages too highly, the freshness of mind which\r\nit brought infinitely outweighing any loss of time, interruption, &c. I\r\nspent three interesting hours in this admirable institution.\r\n\r\nThe next establishment I visited was of a very different description;\r\ni.e., the jail of solitary confinement. I much wished to have seen\r\nsome of the prisoners who had been confined for a length of time, but\r\nfrom some informality in the letter I brought, the guardian did not feel\r\nauthorized to break through the regulations. The prisoners are sometimes\r\nconfined here for twelve years; they are kept totally separate, but they\r\nare allowed to occupy themselves at different trades, &c., in their\r\ncells. My guide told me he had never seen any of them become the least\r\nidiotic or light-headed from long confinement. Their cells were clean\r\nand airy, and some had a little eight-feet-square garden attached; their\r\nfood was both plentiful and good, and discipline was preserved by the\r\nrod of diet; \"but,\" says the guide, \"if they become very troublesome\r\nand obstinate we\" ... what d'ye think?... \"give them a shower-bath;\"\r\ncriminals here seem to hate fresh water as much as the tenants of the\r\npoor-houses in England do. The jail seems very well adapted for\r\nescaping; but I suppose the rifle-armed sentries at the angles of the\r\nwall keep them in sufficient awe, as I was told they very rarely get\r\naway. The number confined was two hundred and eighty.\r\n\r\nThe last place I visited was the Lunatic Asylum, which appears admirably\r\nplaced and admirably conducted. The situation commands a view of two\r\npublic roads, where the bustle and stir of life are continually passing\r\nbefore their eyes, and with no visible fence intervening, the ground\r\nbeing so undulating and wooded as effectually to conceal the barrier.\r\nThe grounds are pleasantly laid out in walks, gardens, hothouses, &c.; a\r\ncomfortable reading-room and ten-pin alley[AF] are provided on each\r\nside, one for the males, the other for the females. The rooms and\r\ndormitories are large and airy, and carriages and horses are ready for\r\nsuch as the physician recommends should take that exercise. The comfort\r\nof the inmates appeared fully equal to that of any similar establishment\r\nI have visited, and the position far superior, for there was no visible\r\nbarrier between them and the open country.\r\n\r\nBut Time says to the traveller what the policeman says to the gathering\r\ncrowd, \"Move on, if you please, sir; move on.\" Obey is the word. Kind\r\nfriends are left behind, the kettle hisses, the iron horse snorts, the\r\nHudson is passed, New York is gained, the journey is behind me, bread,\r\nbutter, and Bohea before me. \"Go on,\" says Time. The Charleston steamer,\r\n\"James Adger,\" is bursting to be off. Introduced to the agents, they\r\nintroduced me to the skipper. The skipper seems to think I am his\r\nfather; he insists upon my occupying his cabin--a jolly room, big enough\r\nto polka in--fifteen feet square. Thanks, most excellent skipper, \"may\r\nyour shadow never be less\"--it is substantial enough now. Do you ask why\r\nI go to New York from Philadelphia to reach Charleston? The reply is\r\nsimple:--to avoid the purgatory of an American railway, and to enjoy the\r\nlife-giving breezes \"that sweep o'er the ocean wave.\" The skipper was\r\na regular trump; the service was clean, and we fed like fighting-cocks.\r\nThe weather was fine, the ship a clipping good one, passengers few, but\r\nwith just enough 'bacco-juice flying about the decks to remind me where\r\nI was.\r\n\r\nOne of our company was a charming rarity in his way. He was an Irish\r\nYankee, aged eighty-three. A more perfect Paddy never existed; and so,\r\nof course, he talked about fighting, and began detailing to me the\r\nvarious frays in which \"we whipt the Britishers.\" By way of chaffing\r\nhim, I said, \"No wonder; they were Anglo-Saxon blood, brought their\r\ncourage from England, and were not only fighting at home, but with a\r\nhalter round their necks.\" The old veteran got furious, cursed England\r\nand the Saxon blood, from Harold to the present hour; he then proved to\r\nhis own satisfaction that all the great men in America, and all the\r\nsoldiers, were Celts. \"It was the Celts, sir, that whipt the Britishers;\r\nand, ould as I am, sure I'd like to take 20,000 men over to the ould\r\ncounthree, and free it from the bloodthirsty villins, the Saxon brutes.\"\r\nIf poor O'Brien had had half the fire of this old Yankee Paddy, he never\r\nwould have been caught snoozing among the old widow's cabbages. I really\r\nthought the old gentleman would have burst outright, or collapsed from\r\nreaction; but it passed over like a white squall, and left the original\r\noctogenarian calm behind. The darkness of the third evening has closed\r\nin upon us, the struggling stream is bellowing for release, hawsers are\r\nflying about, boys running from them, and men after them; the good\r\n\"James Adger\" is coquetting about with those well-known young ladies,\r\nthe Misses \"Bakkur and Ternahed;\" James seems determined to enjoy it for\r\nan unusually prolonged period this evening; but, like everything else,\r\nit must have an end, and at last good James lies snugly in his berth,\r\nalongside the wharf at Charleston. Cabmen and touters offer an infinity\r\nof services; passengers radiate--my Yankee Paddy, it is to be hoped,\r\nwent to an ice-saloon. Your humble servant went to a boarding-house kept\r\nby a most worthy old lady, but where flies occupied one half the house,\r\nand the filthiest negro-boys the other. Several respectable people, out\r\nof regard to the old lady, were performing the penance of residing in\r\nher house: a trip on hot ashes from Dan to Beersheba would have been\r\nluxury by comparison. I resigned myself and got reconciled, as I saw the\r\nsincere desire of the dear old girl to make me as comfortable as she\r\ncould; and by learning to eat my meals with my eyes shut, I got on\r\ntolerably well. But scarce had I set foot in this establishment which I\r\nhave been describing, ere kind friends sprang up to greet me and offer\r\nme the use of their club-room, which was just opposite my\r\nboarding-house; and as this was only the prelude to endless other\r\ncivilities, my lodging saw very little of me; which may be easily\r\nimagined, when it is recollected how famous Charleston is, not only for\r\nthe good living which it affords, but for the liberal hospitality with\r\nwhich it is dispensed. A letter to one gentleman becomes, like magic, an\r\n\"Open Sesame\" to all the cellars and society in the place; and the only\r\npoint in dispute is, who can show you most kindness.\r\n\r\nThe town is conveniently situated between the Ashley and Cooper rivers,\r\nwith a population of 25,000 whites and the same number of blacks; it is\r\na mixture of all that is lovely and annoying. The houses have mostly\r\nlittle gardens attached to them, sparkling with tropical flowers, and\r\nthe streets are shaded with avenues of trees. This is all very lovely to\r\nlook upon; but when you go out to enjoy a stroll, if the air is still, a\r\nbeefsteak would frizzle on the crown of your hat; and if there is the\r\nslightest breeze, the sandy dust, like an Egyptian _khamseen_, laughs at\r\nall precautions, blinding your eyes, stuffing your nose, filling your\r\nmouth, and bringing your hide to a state which I can find no other\r\ncomparison for but that of a box intended to represent a stone pedestal,\r\nand which, when the paint has half dried, is sprinkled with sand to\r\nperfect the delusion. Thus you can understand the lovely and the\r\nannoying of which I have spoken. When the inhabitants wish to take a\r\ndrive, there is a plank road about six miles long, which enables them to\r\nenjoy this luxury. If they are not content with this road, they must\r\nseek their pleasure with the carriages up to their axles in sand. There\r\nare three old royalist buildings still standing--viz., the Episcopal\r\nchurch, the Court-house, and the Exchange. The first reminds one warmly\r\nof the dear old parish church in England, with its heavy oak pulpit and\r\nthe square family pews, and it sobers the mind as it leads the memory to\r\nthose days when, if the church was not full of activity, it was not full\r\nof strife--when parishioners were not brought to loggerheads as to the\r\ncolour of the preacher's gown--when there was no triangular duel (_vide_\r\nMarryat) as to candles, no candles, and lit candles--when, in short, if\r\nthere was but moderate zeal about the substance, there was no\r\nquarrelling about the shadows of religion; and if we were not blessed\r\nwith the zeal of a Bennet, we were not cursed with the strife of a\r\nBarnabas. At the time the colonists kicked us out of this place, by way\r\nof not going empty-handed, we bagged the church-bells as a\r\ntrophy--(query, is not robbing a church sacrilege?)--and they eventually\r\nfound their way into a merchant's store in England, where they remained\r\nfor years. Not long since, having been ferreted out, they were replaced\r\nin their original position, and now summon the Republicans of the\r\nnineteenth century to their devotions as lustily as they did the\r\nRoyalists in the eighteenth. There is nothing remarkable in the two\r\nother buildings, except their antiquity, and the associations arising\r\ntherefrom.[AG]\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking sights here is the turn-out of the Fire\r\nCompanies on any gala day. They consist of eight companies, of one\r\nhundred each; their engines are brilliantly got up, and decorated\r\ntastefully with flowers; banners flying; the men, in gay but\r\nbusiness-like uniform, dragging their engines about, and bands playing\r\naway joyously before them. The peculiarity of the Charleston firemen is\r\nthat, instead of being composed of all the rowdies of the town, as is\r\noften the case in the large eastern cities, they are, generally\r\nspeaking, the most respectable people in the community. This may partly\r\nbe accounted for by the militia service being so hard, and the fines\r\nfor the neglect of the same so heavy, from which all those serving in\r\nthe Fire Companies are exempt.[AH] The South Carolinians, in\r\nanticipation of any insurrection among the negroes, or in case of being\r\ndriven into secession by success attending the efforts of the\r\nAbolitionists, have very prudently established a little miniature West\r\nPoint institution,[AI] where lads from fifteen to twenty receive a\r\nthorough military education, and then retire into private life and\r\nfollow any pursuits they choose. By this means the nucleus of military\r\nofficers requisite for an army is obtained, and the frequent drilling of\r\nthe militia forms a solid groundwork for that latter, should the hour of\r\nnecessity unfortunately arrive. The gay time of Charleston is during the\r\nraces, which take place in February, and have a considerable reputation,\r\nalthough, perhaps, not quite so high as they had some few years back. I\r\nhave never seen any of their racing studs; but, as they import from\r\nEngland some of the finest stallions that come into the market, and as\r\nthe breed of horse in America is very active and enduring, their racers,\r\nit is to be presumed, make a very good show.\r\n\r\nHaving impregnated my system with turtle, terrapin, mint-julep, and\r\nMadeira--the latter such as only America can show--I bade adieu to my\r\nkind and hospitable friends, and started for Virginia. The first part of\r\nthe journey--i.e., as far as Wilmington--I performed in a wretched\r\nlittle steamer, anything but seaworthy, with horrid cribs, three one\r\nabove the other, to sleep in, and a motley mixture of passengers, as\r\nusual. No particular incident occurred; and having fine weather, we\r\nescaped wrecking or putting back. On ascending the river to Wilmington,\r\nyou see royal--I beg pardon, republican--sturgeons jumping about in all\r\ndirections, and of all sizes, from three to five feet in length. We\r\nreached the town in time to catch the train, and off we started. When\r\nabout six miles on our journey, a curious motion of the carriages, added\r\nto their \"slantingdicular\" position and accompanied by a slight scream,\r\nproclaimed that we were off the rails. Thank God! no lives were lost or\r\nlimbs broken. The first person that I saw jump from the train was a\r\nSpanish colonel, who shot out with an activity far beyond his years,\r\nhugging to his bosom a beloved fiddle, which was the joy of his heart,\r\nand about the safety of which he was evidently as anxious as about his\r\nown. He sat down by the side of the carriages, a ludicrous picture of\r\nalarm and composure combined. He was on his way to England with the\r\nintention of presenting some musical compositions to the Queen, and\r\npossibly had a floating idea he might do a bit of Paganini before Her\r\nGracious Majesty. Gradually, all the party unkenneled; and it was then\r\ndiscovered that, had we run off the rails a few yards further on, we\r\nshould have had a nasty cropper down a thirty-feet bank; fortunately, we\r\nran off on the level, and merely stuck in the sand.\r\n\r\nUpon inquiry as to the cause of the accident, I ascertained that it was\r\nin consequence of a point for turning off on to another set of rails\r\nbeing broken. Upon examining the said point, I found it was as worn and\r\nrotten as time could make it. I mentioned this to the engineer, who told\r\nme he was perfectly aware of it, and had reported it to the\r\nsuperintendent a fortnight before, but that he--the superintendent--had\r\nguessed it would do very well for some time yet; consequently, the\r\nengineer always went slower when approaching the spot, to avoid, if\r\npossible, an accident. By this precaution we had been saved the capsize\r\nover the bank, which otherwise would inevitably have been our fate.\r\nThus, for the sake of twenty shillings, they had smashed an engine,\r\ndoing damage to the amount of twenty pounds at least, besides risking\r\nthe lives of all the passengers. What was to be done? There was nothing\r\nfor it but to go back to Wilmington, chew the cud of disgust, and hope\r\nthe rascally superintendent might break every bone in his body the first\r\nfavourable opportunity. This done, and a night's rest over, we again\r\ntempted fate, and continued our journey, which for a long time ran\r\nthrough large pine-forests, every member of which community was a victim\r\nof laceration, inflicted on him for the purpose of drawing off his\r\nlife's blood, which dribbled into a box at the root, and, when full, was\r\ncarried off to make turpentine.\r\n\r\nArrived at Peterborough, we found the population so far behind the\r\nAmerican age, that they would not allow a railroad to pass through their\r\ntown; we were consequently constrained to shift into omnibuses, and\r\ndrive some three miles to the station on the other side. As this trip\r\nwas peculiarly barren of incident, it may gratify the reader to be\r\ninformed, that in the confusion of shifting from one station to the\r\nother I lost my best and only hat. I hope this simple record will be\r\nreceived as conclusive evidence of the monotony and dullness of the\r\njourney. I do not mention it to excite sympathy, for I am happy to say\r\nthat I have since purchased a new and a better one; and in case my old\r\none is found, I hereby will and bequeath the same to the mayor of\r\nPeterborough, his heirs and successors, hoping that they may wear no\r\nother until a railroad round or through the town connects the termini.\r\nAgain we mount the iron horse--time flies--light mingles with\r\ndarkness--and at nine o'clock I alight at the Royal Exchange Hotel,\r\nRichmond. Soap and water, tea and bed, follow in quick succession, and\r\nthen comes the land of dreams and oblivion.\r\n\r\nRichmond is a lovely spot, situated on the northern bank of James River,\r\none hundred and fifty miles from the sea, and is the capital of\r\nVirginia. It contains nearly 30,000 inhabitants of whom 1000 are slaves.\r\nBeing built upon several hills, it is free from the eternal sameness of\r\nlevel and regularity of lines which tire the eye so much in New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, &c., and its site resembles more that of Boston or\r\nBaltimore. The James River is navigable for small vessels as high as\r\nRichmond; but just above the town there is a barrier which arrests alike\r\nthe navigator's course and the traveller's eye. This barrier is called\r\nthe Rapids, and is a most beautiful feature in the scenery.\r\n\r\nThe Rapids are about three-quarters of a mile in extent, having a fall\r\nof more than one hundred feet in that distance. The stream is broad, and\r\ninterspersed with endless little wooded islands and rocks, around and\r\nabove which it dashes the spray and foam in its impetuous descent. The\r\nclimate is lovely, the atmosphere pearly; and when, from the height\r\nabove, you look down upon the panorama spread beneath your feet, it\r\nrecalls to the mind the beautiful view so many of us must have\r\nfrequently been entranced with, while inhaling the meditative weed and\r\nstrolling along Richmond-terrace on a summer afternoon, gazing on old\r\nFather Thames glowing in the rays of a setting sun, and looking doubly\r\nbright from the sombre shade of the venerable timber which fringes the\r\nmargin of this sluggish stream. Pardon this digression; those only who\r\nhave wandered so far away can feel the indefinite, indescribable\r\npleasure with which one grasps at anything that recals the home of one's\r\naffections, the scenes of early days, and the dear friends who are still\r\nenjoying them.\r\n\r\nThe best place for reviewing the Rapids is from the drive leading to the\r\nCemetery, which here, as in most large American towns, is one of the\r\nprettiest spots in the neighbourhood; but the Rapids are not only\r\nornamental, they are eminently useful. They afford a water-power to\r\nseveral mills, one of which, the Gallego Flour-Mill, is a splendid\r\nestablishment, six stories high, nearly one hundred feet square, and\r\ncapable of sending out daily 1200 barrels of flour. The flour is of very\r\nsuperior quality, the brand fetching a higher price than that of most\r\nothers in the country. There are also rolling-mills, cotton and tobacco\r\nfactories; the latter of course in great quantities, as tobacco is one\r\nof the chief products of the state, and rapidly increasing. The produce\r\nentered in Richmond, which in 1851 was under 16,000 hogsheads, in 1852\r\namounted to more than 24,000, and is now very probably above 30,000.\r\nVirginia has the honour of being the first State that raised cotton, the\r\ncultivation whereof was commenced in the year 1662.\r\n\r\nLet us pass on to the hill at the eastern extremity of the city,\r\ncommanding a panoramic view of the river below the town, and all the\r\nsurrounding country. One spot arrests the attention, a spot closed with\r\nthe deepest and most romantic interest. A solitary tree, to which no\r\nsacrilegious hand has yet dared to apply the axe, stands a few miles\r\ndown the river, on the same side as the town, and marks the site of the\r\nlodge of the venerable old chieftain, Powhattan, when as yet the colony\r\nwas in its infancy, and when the Indian and the white man--the spoiler\r\nand the spoiled--were looking at each other with mutual distrust, deep\r\nfear on one side and dark foreboding on the other. The Indian is no\r\nmore; and nought remains as a memorial of this chief who once ruled this\r\nfertile land with absolute sway, except this solitary tree;--and what an\r\nepisode in the history of colonization does that tree recal! Who can\r\nforget that, when despair was the Colonists' daily bread, when nought\r\nbut the energy and genius of Smith--a man of very ordinary name, but of\r\nno ordinary character--kept hope flickering in its socket, an attack of\r\nIndians made him a prisoner, and left them hopeless. Then, how romantic\r\nthe tale of his captivity! He betrayed no fear, but retained perfect\r\nself-possession; and remembering how easy their superstitious minds\r\ncould be worked upon, he drew forth, and with great solemnity commenced\r\nlooking steadily at his pocket-compass, and thence to heaven,\r\nalternating between the two, until he impressed them with a feeling of\r\nawe, as though he were a superior being communing with the Great Spirit.\r\nThis feeling gradually wearing off, the captors insisted upon his death,\r\nas an expiation for the many injuries they had experienced at the hands\r\nof the whites. The tribe meet, the block is prepared, the captive's neck\r\nis laid ready, the upraised tomahawk, held by a brawny Indian arm, whose\r\nevery muscle quivers with revenge, glitters in the sunbeams; swarthy\r\nfigures around, thirsting for blood, anxiously await the sacrifice of\r\nthe victim, already too long delayed. Hope has fled from the captive's\r\nbreast, and he is communing in earnest with the Great Spirit into whose\r\npresence he is about to be so sadly and speedily ushered. Suddenly a\r\nshriek is heard! At that well-known voice the savage arm falls helpless\r\nat its side, as, stretched upon the neck of the despairing captive, lies\r\nthe lovely daughter of Powhattan, with tearful eye, and all the wild\r\nenergy of her race, vowing she will not survive the butchery of her\r\nkindest friend. Ruthless hands would tear her away, and complete the\r\nbloody tragedy. Who dares lay even a finger upon the noble daughter of\r\ntheir adored chief? They stand abashed, revenge and doubt striving in\r\ntheir hearts; the eloquence of love and mercy pleading irresistibly from\r\nthe eyes of Pocahontas. The tomahawk, upraised by man's revenge for the\r\nwork of a captive's death, descends, when moved by woman's tears, to cut\r\na captive's bonds.\r\n\r\nCallous indeed must that man's heart be, who can gaze upon the spot\r\nwhere the noble Pocahontas--reared among savages, 'mid the solemn\r\ngrandeur of the forest, and beneath, the broad canopy of heaven, with no\r\nGospel light to guide and soften--received the holy impulses of love and\r\nmercy fresh from her Maker's hand; and how gratifying to remember, that\r\nshe who had thus early imbibed these sacred feelings, became soon after\r\na convert to Christianity. Alas! how short her Christian career.\r\nMarrying Mr. J. Rolfe, she died in childbirth ere she had reached her\r\ntwenty-fifth year, and from her many of the oldest families in Virginia\r\nat this day have their origin. Virginia, as is well known, has always\r\nbeen considered an aristocratic State; and it is a kind of joke--in\r\nallusion to this Indian origin--for other States to speak disparagingly\r\nof the F.F.Vs.--_alias_ first families of Virginia. Let those who sneer,\r\nseek carefully amid their musty ancestral rolls for a nobler heart than\r\nthat of Pocahontas, the joy of Powhattan's house and the pride of all\r\nhis tribe. How strange, that a scene so well known as the foregoing, and\r\na life so adventurous as that of Smith, has never yet engaged the pen of\r\na Cooper or a Bulwer!\r\n\r\nOne of my friends in New York had given me a letter to a gentleman in\r\nRichmond, at whose house I called soon after my arrival, as my stay was\r\nnecessarily short. He was out in the country, at his plantation. This\r\ndisappointment I endeavoured to rectify by enclosing the letter; but\r\nwhen I had done so, Sambo could not tell me how to address it, as he was\r\nin ignorance both of the place and its distance. In this dilemma, and\r\nwhile ransacking my brain-box how to remedy the difficulty, a lady came\r\nin, and having passed me, Sambo--grinning through a _chevaux-de-frise_\r\nof snow-white ivories--informed me that was \"his Missus.\" I instantly\r\nsent the letter in to her to receive its direction, and in lieu of my\r\nletter received an immediate summons to walk in. Nothing could be more\r\nlady-like and cordial than the reception she gave me. Shy as I am, she\r\nimmediately put me quite at my ease; in less than a quarter of an hour I\r\nfelt I was in the society of an old friend; and during my stay in\r\nRichmond, each day found me in the same snug corner of the sofa, near\r\nthe fire, enjoying the society of one of the most amiable and agreeable\r\nladies it has ever been my good fortune to meet. The husband soon\r\nreturned from the plantation, and then all the hospitalities of the\r\nhouse were as much at my disposal as if it had been my own, and one or\r\nthe other of these kind friends, if not both, daily lionized me over\r\nRichmond or its neighbourhood. I feel sure, that any of my countrymen\r\nwho have visited this city when Mr. and Mrs. Stanard were staying in\r\ntown, will readily hear testimony to their kind hospitality and\r\nagreeable society.\r\n\r\nThere are various public buildings here, among the most conspicuous of\r\nwhich is the Capitol, built in the great public square, and from its\r\nsummit commanding a splendid panoramic view. There are also about thirty\r\nchurches, one of which, the Monumental Church--which is\r\nEpiscopalian--stands upon ground of melancholy recollections; for here,\r\nin 1811, stood the theatre, which during that year was utterly consumed\r\nby a fire, in which the governor and scores of other human beings\r\nperished. One great cause of the destruction of life was, having the\r\ndoors of the building fitted to open inwards--a custom, the folly of\r\nwhich is only equalled by its universality. At the cry of fire, the rush\r\nto the doors was so great that it was impossible to open them, owing to\r\nthe pressure. The only avenues of escape were the windows, in retreating\r\nthrough which, the greater number of those few who succeeded in escaping\r\nsuffered the most serious injuries. How is this absurd practice of doors\r\nopening inwards to be stopped? What think you if Insurance Companies\r\nwould combine, and make people forfeit their insurance if they entered\r\nany public building whose doors were so fitted; or perhaps the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer might bring in a bill to levy a very heavy\r\ntax on all public buildings the doors of which opened in this dangerous\r\nmanner, and containing a stringent clause compelling managers and all\r\nparties concerned to support the widows and orphans, and pay the\r\ndoctors' fees, arising from accidents caused therefrom. Alas! I fear\r\nuntil--as Sydney Smith would say--we reduce a few cabinet ministers and\r\na leading member or two of the House of Peers to cinders, we shall go on\r\nin our folly, because our ancestors did so before us.\r\n\r\nAmong other places I went to was the public billiard-room, and on\r\nentering, my sympathies were immediately aroused by seeing a lad about\r\nthirteen or fourteen, with a very extensive flaming choker on, above\r\nwhich was a frightful large swelling. Not being a medical man, I was\r\nvery much puzzled when I saw the said swelling move about like a penny\r\nroll in a monkey's cheek; presently the sympathy fled, and the puzzle\r\nwas solved, as a shower of 'bacco juice deluged the floor. Poor boy! it\r\nmust have taken him an hour's hard work to have got the abominable mass\r\nin, and it could only have been done by instalments: the size it had\r\nreached would have broken any jaw to remove in the lump; but he seemed\r\nto have no idea of parting with his treasure, which, to do him justice,\r\nhe rolled about with as much ease as if he had had a monkey-teacher\r\nbefore him from his cradle; nor did it prevent his betting away in a\r\nstyle that quite astonished a steady old gentleman like myself.\r\n\r\nThe State of Virginia, like all the other States of the Union, is\r\nundergoing the increasing pressure of democracy:[AJ] one of its\r\nfeatures--which is peculiarly obnoxious to the more sober-minded of the\r\ncommunity--is the new arrangement for the division of the electoral\r\ndistricts, and which goes by the name of \"Gerymander.\" In the early days\r\nof the Republic, all divisions were made by straight lines, or as near\r\nstraight as possible; but that fair and natural mode of division is not\r\nconsidered by the autocratic democracy as sufficiently favourable to\r\ntheir views; and the consequence is, that other divisions have been\r\nsubstituted, most irregular in shape, so as if possible to annihilate\r\nentirely the already weakened opposition. This operation, my informant\r\ntold me, acquired a kind of celebrity in Massachusetts some years ago;\r\nand, in the discussions upon the subject in their State legislature, one\r\nof the speakers is said to have compared some of these arbitrary\r\ndivisions to a salamander which, in their outline they somewhat\r\nresembled. The governor of the State was of the democratic party, and\r\ntherefore supporting and encouraging these changes, and his name was\r\n\"Gery;\" so a wag interrupted the speaker, exclaiming, \"Don't say\r\nsalamander; call it Gerymander,\"--by which name it has been known since\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\nI may here as well mention a little occurrence I witnessed, which,\r\nhowever pleasant it may have been to the democratic rowdies enacting it,\r\nmust have been anything but agreeable to those operated upon. A fire\r\ncompany was out trying its engine and hoses, and followed of course by a\r\nsquad of the idle and unwashed. Arrived at the market-place, they tried\r\nits range; that appeared satisfactory enough; but the idea seems to\r\nhave struck the man who held the hose-end, that range without good aim\r\nwas useless: he accordingly looked round for a target, and a glass coach\r\npassing by at the time, it struck him as peculiarly suited for his\r\nexperiment. Two elderly females were inside, and a white Jehu on the\r\nbox. In the most deliberate manner he pointed his weapon, amidst\r\nencouraging shouts from bystanders, and increasing zeal on the part of\r\nthe pumpers; lucidly the windows were closed, or the ladies would have\r\nbeen drenched; as it was, the gushing stream rattled against the\r\ncarriage, then fixed itself steadily upon poor Jehu, frightening the\r\nhorses and nearly knocking him off the box. Naturally enough Jehu was\r\nhighly incensed, and pulled up; then getting off the box, he walked up\r\nto his assailants, who received him with shouts of laughter; the horses,\r\nleft without a ruler, started off at a gallop, Jehu ran after them, but\r\nluckily another person and myself rushed up, and stopped them before any\r\naccident occurred.\r\n\r\nAll this took place at noonday, and not a voice was raised against it.\r\nIf I had presumed to interfere with this liberty of the subject, the\r\nchances are I should have been tied to one of the posts of the\r\nmarket-place and made to stand target for an hour. It must be a charming\r\nthing when the masses rule supreme. Fancy St. James's-street, upon a\r\ndrawing-room day, full of a pleasant little water-dispensing community\r\nsuch as this;--what cheers they would raise as a good shot took off some\r\nJarvy's cocked-hat and bob-wig, or sent his eighteen-inch-diameter\r\nbouquet flying into the street!--then what fun to play upon the padded\r\ncalves and silk stockings of Patagonian John, as he stood behind!--and\r\nonly imagine the immense excitement, if by good luck they could smash\r\nsome window and deluge a live aristocrat! What a nice thing a pure\r\ndemocracy must be! how the majority must enjoy themselves! how the\r\nminority must rejoice at the mild rule of bone over brain! What a\r\nglorious idea, equality! only excelled by that gigantic conception of\r\nMessrs. Cobden and Co., yclept the Peace Society, upon which such a\r\nbloody comment was enacted before Sevastopol.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote AD: General Cadwallader, whose hospitality is well known to\r\nall strangers visiting Philadelphia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AE: Alas! she has since met a melancholy death, being\r\naccidentally poisoned in Mexico, on the 18th of June, 1854; but her fame\r\nis as imperishable as her life was stainless.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AF: The origin of ten-pins is amusing enough, and is as\r\nfollows:--The State having passed an act, during a time when religious\r\nfervour was at high pressure, prohibiting nine-pin alleys, a tenth pin\r\nwas added, and the law evaded.

On\r\nour way down, we picked up as healthy and jolly a set of little ducks in\r\ntheir 'teens as one could wish to see. On inquiring what this aggregate\r\nof rosy cheeks and sunny smiles represented, I was informed they were\r\nthe sum total of a ladies' school at Williamsburg--and a very charming\r\nsum total they were. Having a day's holiday, they had come up by the\r\nearly steamer to pic-nic on the banks, and were now returning to\r\nchronology and crotchet-work, or whatever else their studies might be.\r\nLanding at King's Mills, a \"'bus\" took us all up to Williamsburg, a\r\ndistance of three or four miles, one half of which was over as dreary a\r\nroad as need be, and the other through a shady forest grove.\r\n\r\nThis old city is composed of a straight street, at one end of which is\r\nthe establishment occupied by the rosy cheeks of whom we have been\r\nspeaking, and which is very neat and clean-looking; at the other\r\nend--only with half a mile of country intervening--is the college. On\r\neach side of the said street is a crescent of detached houses, with a\r\ncommon before them. The population is 1500, and has not varied--as far\r\nas I could learn--in the memory of the oldest inhabitant. I naturally\r\nfelt very much interest in visiting this place, as it was originally the\r\nseat of the royal government, and my grandfather had been the last\r\ngovernor of the state. The body of the old palace was burnt down by\r\naccident, while occupied by French troops, in 1782. The foundations,\r\nwhich were six feet thick, are still traceable, although most of the\r\nbricks have been used for the buildings in the neighbourhood. The\r\noutlines of the old garden and its terraces may also be traced, and a\r\nvery charming spot it must have been. There are two beautiful\r\nlime-trees in a thriving state, which, I was told, he had planted\r\nhimself from seeds he had brought from home. His thoughts were evidently\r\non that far-off home when he planted them; for, as to position\r\nrelatively to each other and distance from the old palace, they\r\nprecisely coincide with two beneath which many of my early days were\r\npassed, at the old family mansion of Glenfinarl, on Loch Fine, which has\r\nsince become the property of Mr. Douglas.\r\n\r\nThere is an old ditch in the neighbourhood, which goes by the name of\r\nLord Dunmore's Ditch. The history which my informant gave me thereof is\r\nabsurd enough, and there is a negro of the name of Isaac still living\r\nwho remembers all the circumstances. It appears that Lord Dunmore,\r\nhaving found fault with an Irish labourer for not doing sufficient work,\r\nPaddy replied, \"'Faith, if 'twas yer 'onnur that had the shpade in yer\r\nhand, maybe one-half would satisfy yer 'onnur.\" The Governor, who\r\nhappened to be a man of iron frame, and not at all averse to a joke,\r\nimmediately took up Paddy's challenge, and replied, \"Paddy, I'll work\r\nfour hours against you in a ditch for a month's wages.\" The combatants\r\nset to work the following morning, and at the end of four hours Paddy\r\nwas obliged to confess himself beaten, and the result of my\r\ngrandfather's labours goes by the name of Lord Dunmore's Ditch to this\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe only parts of the old palace still standing are the two wings, one\r\nof which is now the parsonage, and the other a school, which is kept by\r\nan Englishman, educated at one of our universities, and living here for\r\nhis health. This place is both a well-chosen and a favourite locality\r\nfor schools, being situated upon a high plateau of land, with James\r\nRiver on one side and York River on the other; consequently, the air is\r\npeculiarly healthy and pure.\r\n\r\nThe most imposing, if not the most useful, of the scholastic\r\nestablishments is the college, which was founded by William and Mary in\r\nthe year 1692. It contains a very fair library of old books, but\r\ncomparatively few additions appear to have been made in latter years.\r\nThe building bears every internal mark of neglect and dilapidation,\r\ndefaced walls, broken plaster, &c. Upon entering the lecture-room, a\r\nquantity of eighteen-inch square boxes full of moisture suggest the idea\r\nof a rainy day and a roofless chamber. Be not deceived: these are\r\nmerely receptacles for the discharge of the students' 'bacco juice; and\r\nthe surrounding floor gives painful demonstration that their free\r\nspirits scorn the trammels of eighteen-inch boundaries, however\r\nprofusely supplied. From what causes I cannot say, but the college has\r\nbeen all but deserted until lately. The present authorities are striving\r\nto infuse into it a little vitality of usefulness. With these simple\r\nfacts before me, it was amusing to read, in an American gazetteer of the\r\nday, that the college \"is at present in a flourishing condition.\"\r\n\r\nIn front of the college there is an enclosed green, and in the centre a\r\nstatue, erected in honour of one of the old royal governors, Berkeley,\r\nLord Bowtetort. Whether from a desire to exhibit their anti-aristocratic\r\nsentiments, or from innate Vandalism, or from a childish wish to exhibit\r\nindependence by doing mischief, the said statue is the pistol-mark for\r\nthe students, who have exhibited their skill as marksmen by its total\r\nmutilation, in spite of all remonstrances from the authorities. The\r\ncollege was formerly surrounded by magnificent elms, but a few years\r\nsince a blight came which destroyed every one of them, leaving the\r\nbuilding in a desert-like nakedness. The inn at Williamsburg is a\r\nmiserable building, but it is kept by as kind-hearted, jolly old\r\nJohn-Bull-looking landlord as ever was seen, and who rejoices in the\r\nname of Uncle Ben. Meat is difficult to get at, as there are no\r\nbutchers; the cream and butter are, however, both plentiful and\r\nexcellent. The house is almost entirely overshadowed by one magnificent\r\nelm, which has fortunately escaped the blight that annihilated nearly\r\nall its fellows.\r\n\r\nAfter the hustle of most American cities, there was to me an unspeakable\r\ncharm in the quiet of this place. Sitting at the inn-door, before you\r\nlies the open green, with its daisies and buttercups; horses and cattle\r\nare peaceably grazing; in the background are the remaining wings of the\r\nold palace; to your left stands the old village church, built with\r\nbricks brought from England, and long since mellowed by the hand of\r\ntime, around which the clinging ivy throws the venerable mantle of its\r\ndark and massive foliage. Now, the summoning church-bell tolls its\r\nsolemn note; school children, with merry laugh and light step, cross the\r\ncommon; the village is astir, and a human tide is setting towards its\r\nsacred portals: all, all speaks to the heart and to the imagination of\r\nhappy days and happy scenes in a far-off land. You close your eyes, the\r\nbetter to realize the dream which fancy is painting. When they open upon\r\nthe reality again, the illusion is dispelled by the sight of a brawny\r\nnegro, with a grin on his face which threatens to split his ears,\r\njogging merrily along the street with a huge piece of sturgeon for his\r\nSunday feast. My friends, however, left me little time to indulge in a\r\ncontemplative mood, for good old Madeira, a hearty welcome, and a stroll\r\nabout and around the place, filled up the day; while the fragrant weed\r\nand the social circle occupied no small portion of the evening. Having\r\nspent a few but very pleasant days here, I took leave of my hospitable\r\nfriends--not forgetting that jovial soul, Uncle Ben; then embarking in a\r\nsteamer, and armed with a solitary letter of introduction, I started off\r\nto visit a plantation on the banks of James River.\r\n\r\nA planter's home, like the good Highland laird's, seems made of India\r\nrubber. Without writing to inquire whether the house is full, or your\r\ncompany agreeable, you consider the former improbable and the latter\r\ncertain. When you approach your victim, a signal is thrown out; the\r\nanswer is a boat; in you get, bag and baggage; you land at the foot of\r\nhis lawn or of some little adjoining pier, and thus apparently force\r\nyourself upon his hospitality. Reader, if it is ever your good fortune\r\nto be dropped with a letter of introduction at Shirley, one glance from\r\nthe eye of the amiable host and hostess, accompanied by a real shake of\r\nthe hand, satisfy you beyond doubt you are truly and heartily welcome. A\r\nplanter's house on James River reminds one in many ways of the old\r\ncountry. The building is old, the bricks are of the brownest red, and in\r\nmany places concealed by ivy of colonial birth; a few venerable monarchs\r\nof the forest throw their ample shade over the greensward, which slopes\r\ngently down to the water. The garden, the stables, the farm-yard, the\r\nold gates, the time-honoured hues of everything,--all is so different\r\nfrom the new facing and new painting which prevails throughout the\r\nNorth, that you feel you are among other elements; and if you go inside\r\nthe house, the thoughts also turn homeward irresistibly as the eye\r\nwanders from object to object. The mahogany table and the old\r\ndining-room chairs, bright with that dark ebony polish of time which\r\nhuman ingenuity vainly endeavours to imitate; the solid bookcases, with\r\ntheir quaint gothic-windowly-arranged glass-doors, behind which, in calm\r\nand dusty repose, lie heavy patriarchal-looking tomes on the lower\r\nshelves, forming a sold basis above which to place lighter and less\r\nscholastic literature; an arm-chair, that might have held the invading\r\nCaesar, and must have been second-hand in the days of the conquering\r\nWilliam; a carpet, over whose chequered face the great Raleigh might\r\nhave strolled in deep contemplation; a rug, on whose surface generations\r\nof spinsters might have watched the purrings of their pet Toms or gazed\r\non the glutinous eyes and inhaled the loaded breeze that came from the\r\nfat and fragrant Pug: whichever way the eye turned, whatever direction\r\nthe imagination took, the conviction forced upon the mind was, that you\r\nwere in an inheritance, and that what the wisdom and energy of one\r\ngeneration had gathered together, succeeding generations had not yet\r\nscattered to the winds by the withering blast of infinitesimal division.\r\nWith the imagination thus forcibly filled with home and its\r\nassociations, you involuntarily feel disposed to take a stroll on the\r\nlawn; but on reaching the door, your ears are assailed by wild shouts of\r\ninfantine laughter, and, raising your eyes, you behold a dozen little\r\nblack imps skylarking about in every direction, their fat faces, bright\r\neyes, and sunny smiles beaming forth joyousness and health. Home and its\r\nvarying visions fly at the sight, giving place to the reality that you\r\nare on a slave plantation. Of the slaves I shall say nothing here beyond\r\nthe general fact that they appeared healthy, well fed, and well clothed\r\non all the plantations I visited. Having enjoyed the hospitalities of\r\nShirley for a few days, it was agreed that I should make a descent upon\r\nanother property lower down the river. So, bidding adieu to my good\r\nfriends at Shirley, I embarked once more on the steamer, and was landed\r\nat the pier of Brandon, in the most deluging rain imaginable. A walk of\r\na quarter of a mile brought me to the door like a drowned rat, a note\r\nfrom my Shirley friends secured me an immediate and cordial welcome.\r\n\r\nBrandon is perhaps the plantation which is more thoroughly kept up than\r\nany other on the James River, and which consequently has altered less.\r\nI am alluding now to the house and grounds about, not to the plantation\r\nat large; for I believe the proprietor at Shirley is reckoned A1 as a\r\nfarmer. I have before alluded to the blight which destroyed so many fine\r\nelms on both shores of the James River. The withering insect appeared at\r\nBrandon; but the lady of the house soon proved that she knew the use of\r\ntobacco as well as the men, by turning a few hogsheads of the said weed\r\ninto water, making thereby a murderous decoction, with which, by the\r\nintervention of a fire-engine, she utterly annihilated the countless\r\nhosts of the all-but invisible enemy, and thus saved some of the finest\r\nelms I ever saw in my life, under the shade of which the old family\r\nmansion had enjoyed shelter from many a summer's sun. Brandon is the\r\nonly place I visited where the destroyer had not left marks of his\r\nravages. The lawn is beautifully laid out, and in the style of one of\r\nour country villas of the olden time, giving every assurance of comfort\r\nand every feeling of repose. The tropical richness and brightness of\r\nleaf and flower added an inexpressible charm to them, as they stood out\r\nin bold relief against the pure and cloudless air around, so different\r\nfrom that indistinct outline which is but too common in our moist\r\natmosphere. Then there was the graceful and weeping willow, the\r\ntrembling aspen, the wild ivy, its white bloom tinged as with maiden's\r\nblush; the broad-leafed catalpa; the magnolia, rich in foliage and in\r\nflower; while scattered around were beds of bright and lovely colours.\r\nThe extremes of this charming view were bounded, either by the venerable\r\nmansion over whose roof the patriarchal elms of which we have been\r\nspeaking threw their cool and welcome shade, or by the broad stream\r\nwhose bosom was ever and anon enlivened with some trim barque or\r\nrapid-gliding steamer, and whose farther shore was wooded to the water's\r\nedge. There is one of the finest China rose-trees here I ever beheld; it\r\ncovers a space of forty feet square, being led over on trellis-work, and\r\nit might extend much beyond that distance: it is one mass of flowers\r\nevery year. Unfortunately, I was a week too late to see it in its glory;\r\nbut the withered flowers gave ample evidence how splendid it must have\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nIn one of my drives, I went to see an election which took place in the\r\nneighbourhood. The road for some distance lay through a forest full of\r\nmagnificent timber; but, like most forest timber, that which gives it a\r\nmarketable value destroys its picturesque effect. A few noble\r\nstems--however poor their heads--have a fine effect when surrounded by\r\nothers which have had elbow-room; but a forest of stems, with\r\nLilliputian heads--great though the girth of the stem may be--conveys\r\nrather the idea of Brobdingnagian piles driven in by giants, and\r\nexhibiting the last flickerings of vitality in a few puny sprouts at\r\ntheir summit. The underwood was enlivened by shrubs of every shade and\r\nhue, the wild flowering ivy predominating. The carriage-springs were\r\ntested by an occasional drop of the wheels into a pit-hole, on merging\r\nfrom which you came sometimes to a hundred yards of rut of dimensions\r\nsimilar to those of military approaches to a citadel; nevertheless, I\r\nenjoyed my drive excessively. The place of election was a romantic spot\r\nnear a saw-mill, at the edge of what, in a gentleman's park in England,\r\nwould be called a pretty little lake, styled in America a small pond. As\r\neach party arrived, the horse was hitched to the bough of some tree, and\r\nthe company divided itself into various knots; a good deal of tobacco\r\nwas expended in smoke and juice; there was little excitement; all were\r\njolly and friendly; and, in short, the general scene conveyed the idea\r\nof a gathering together for field-preaching; but that was speedily\r\nreplaced by the idea of a pleasant pic-nic of country farmers, as a\r\ndashing charge was made by the whole _posse comitatus_ upon a long table\r\nwhich was placed under a fine old elm, and lay groaning beneath the\r\nweight of substantial meat and drink. As for drunkenness, they were all\r\nas sober as washerwomen. So much for a rural election-scene in Virginia.\r\n\r\nBy way of making time pass agreeably, it was proposed to take a sail in\r\na very nice yacht, called \"The Breeze,\" which belonged to a neighbouring\r\nplanter. We all embarked, in the cool of the evening, and the merry\r\nlaugh would soon have told you the fair sex was fairly represented.\r\nUnfortunately, the night was so still that not a breath rippled the\r\nsurface of the river, except as some inquisitive zephyr came curling\r\nalong the stream, filling us with hope, and then, having satisfied its\r\ncuriosity, suddenly disappeared, as though in mockery of our distress.\r\nThe name of the yacht afforded ample field for punning, which was\r\ncruelly taken advantage of by all of us; and if our cruise was not a\r\nlong one, at all events it was very pleasant, and full of fun and\r\nfrolic. Pale Cinthia was throwing her soft and silvery light over the\r\neastern horizon before we landed.\r\n\r\nWalking up the lawn, the scene was altogether lovely; the fine trees\r\naround were absolutely alive with myriads of fire-flies. These bright\r\nand living lights, darting to and fro 'mid the dark foliage, formed the\r\nmost beautiful illumination imaginable--at one time clustering into a\r\nball of glowing fire, at another streaking away in a line of lightning\r\nflame; then, bursting into countless sparks, they would for a moment\r\ndisappear in the depths of their sombre bower, to come forth again in\r\nsome more varied and more lovely form.\r\n\r\nPleasant indeed were the hours I passed here; lovely was the climate,\r\nbeautiful was the landscape, hearty was the welcome: every day found\r\nsome little plan prepared to make their hospitality more pleasant to the\r\nstranger; nature herself seemed to delight in aiding their efforts, for\r\nthough I arrived in a deluge, I scarce ever saw a cloud afterwards. As\r\nthe morning light stole through my open window in undimmed transparency,\r\nthe robin, the blue-bird, the mocking-bird, the hosts of choral\r\nwarblers, held their early oratorio in the patriarchal elms. If\r\nunskilled in music's science, they were unfettered by its laws, and\r\nhymned forth their wild and varied notes as though calling upon man to\r\nadmire and adore the greatness and the goodness of his Maker, and to\r\n\r\n  \"Shake off dull sloth, and early rise,\r\n  To pay his morning sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\nIf such were their appeal, it was not made in vain; for both morning and\r\nevening--both here and at Shirley--every member and visitor gathered\r\nround the family altar, the services of which were performed with equal\r\ncheerfulness and reverence. I felt as if I could have lingered on and on\r\nin this charming spot, and amid such warm hospitality, an indefinite\r\nperiod; it was indeed with sincere regret I was obliged to bid adieu to\r\nmy agreeable hosts, and once more embark on board the steamer.\r\n\r\nThe river James lacks entirely those features that give grandeur to\r\nscenery; the river, it is true, by its tortuous windings, every now and\r\nthen presents a broad sheet of water; the banks are also prettily\r\nwooded; but there is a great sameness, and a total absence of that\r\nmountain scenery so indispensable to grandeur. The only thing that\r\nrelieves the eye is a glimpse, from time to time, of some lovely spot\r\nlike the one I have just been describing; but such charming villas, like\r\nangel's visits, are \"few and far between.\" Here we are, at Norfolk. How\r\ndifferent is this same Norfolk from the other eastern ports I have\r\nvisited!--there all is bustle, activity, and increase,--here all is\r\ndreariness, desolation, and stagnation. It is, without exception, the\r\nmost uninteresting town I ever set foot in; the only thing that gives it\r\na semblance of vitality is its proximity to the dockyard, and the\r\nconsequent appearance of officers in uniform; but in spite of this\r\nimpression, which a two-days' residence confirmed me in, I was told, on\r\ngood authority, that it is thriving and improving. By the statistics\r\nwhich our consul, Mr. James, was kind enough to furnish me, it appears\r\nthat 1847 was the great year of its commercial activity, its imports in\r\nthat year valuing 94,000l., and its exports 364,000l. In 1852, the\r\nimports were under 25,000l. and the exports a little more than\r\n81,000l., which is certainly, by a comparison with the average of the\r\nten years preceding, an evidence of decreasing, rather than increasing,\r\ncommercial prosperity. Its population is 16,000; and that small\r\nnumber--when it is remembered that it is the port of entry for the great\r\nstate of Virginia--is a strong argument against its asserted prosperity.\r\nNot long before my arrival they had been visited with a perfect deluge\r\nof rain, accompanied with a waterspout, which evidently had whirled up\r\nsome of the ponds in the neighbourhood; for quantities of cat-fish fell\r\nduring the storm, one of which, measuring ten inches, a friend told me\r\nhe had himself picked up at a considerable distance from any water.\r\n\r\nThe only real object of interest at Norfolk is the dockyard, which of\r\ncourse I visited. Mr. James was kind enough to accompany me, and it is\r\nneedless to say we were treated with the utmost courtesy, and every\r\nfacility afforded us for seeing everything of interest, after which we\r\nenjoyed an excellent lunch at the superintendent's. They were building a\r\nsplendid frigate, intended to carry 58-inch guns; her length was 250\r\nfeet, and her breadth of beam 48. Whether the manifest advantages of\r\nsteam will induce them to change her into a screw frigate, I cannot say.\r\nThe dockyard was very clean and the buildings airy. Steam, saw-mills,\r\n&c., were in full play, and anchors forging under Nasmyth's hammer, I\r\nfound them making large masts of four pieces--one length and no\r\nscarfings--the root part of the tree forming the mast-head, and a very\r\nlarge air-hole running up and down the centre. The object of this\r\nair-hole is to allow the mast to season itself; the reader may remember\r\nthat the mast of the \"Black Maria\" is made the same way. As far as I\r\nknow, this is a plan we have not yet tried in our dockyards. I find that\r\nthey use metallic boats far more than we do. I saw some that had\r\nreturned after being four years in commission, which were perfectly\r\nsound. To say that I saw fine boats and spars here, would be like a\r\ntraveller remarking he saw a great many coals at Newcastle. All waste\r\nwood not used in the yard is given away every Saturday to any old woman\r\nwho will come and take it; and no searching of people employed in the\r\ndockyard is ever thought of. The cattle employed in and for the dockyard\r\nhave a most splendid airy stable, and are kept as neat and clean as if\r\nin a drawing-room. Materials are abundant; but naturally there is little\r\nbustle and activity when compared to that which exists in a British\r\nyard. Their small navy can hardly find them enough work to keep their\r\n\"hands in;\" but doubtless the first knell of the accursed tocsin of war,\r\nwhile it gave them enough to do, would soon fill their dockyards with\r\nable and willing hands to do it. Commodore Ringold's surveying\r\nexpedition, consisting of a corvette, schooner, steamer, &c., was\r\nfitting out for service, and most liberally and admirably were they\r\nsupplied with all requisites and comforts for their important duties.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay I enjoyed the kind hospitalities of our consul, Mr.\r\nG.P.E. James, who is so well known to the literary world. He was\r\nindulging the good people of Norfolk with lectures, which seem to be all\r\nthe fashion with the Anglo-Saxon race wherever they are gathered\r\ntogether. The subject which I heard him treat of was \"The Novelists,\"\r\nhandling some favourites with severity and others with a gentler touch,\r\nand winding up with a glowing and just eulogy upon the author of _My\r\nNovel_. Altogether I spent a very pleasant hour and a half.\r\n\r\nI may here mention a regulation of the Foreign-office, which, however\r\nnecessary it may be considered, every one must admit presses very hardly\r\non British _employés_ in the Slave States. I allude to the regulation by\r\nwhich officials are prevented from employing other people's slaves as\r\ntheir servants. White men soon earn enough money to be enabled to set\r\nup in some trade, business, or farm, and, as service is looked down\r\nupon, they seize the first opportunity of quitting it, even although\r\ntheir comforts may be diminished by the change. Free negroes won't\r\nserve, and the official must not employ a slave; thus, a gentleman sent\r\nout to look after the interest of his country, and in his own person to\r\nuphold its dignity, must either submit to the dictation and extortion of\r\nhis white servant--if even then he can keep him--or he may be called\r\nupon suddenly, some fine morning, to do all the work of housemaid, John,\r\ncook, and knife and button boy, to the neglect of those duties he was\r\nappointed by his country to perform, unless he be a married man with a\r\nlarge family, in which case he may perhaps delegate to them the\r\nhonourable occupations, above named. Surely there is something a little\r\npuritanical in the prohibition. To hold a slave is one thing, but to\r\nemploy the labour of one who is a slave, and over whose hopes of freedom\r\nyou have no control, is quite another thing; and I hold that, under the\r\nactual circumstances, the employment of another's slave could never he\r\nso distorted in argument as to bring home a charge of connivance in a\r\nsystem we so thoroughly repudiate.\r\n\r\nGo to the East, follow in imagination your ambassadors, ministers, and\r\nconsular authorities. Behold them on the most friendly terms--or\r\nstriving to be so--with people in high places, who are but too often\r\nrevelling in crimes, with the very name of which they would scorn even\r\nto pollute their lips; and I would ask, did such a monstrous absurdity\r\never enter into any one's head as to doubt from these amicable relations\r\nwhether the Government of this country or its agents repudiated such\r\nabomination of abominations? If for political purposes you submit to\r\nthis latter, while for commercial purposes you refuse to tolerate the\r\nformer, surely you are straining at a black gnat while swallowing a\r\nbeastly camel. Such, good people of the Foreign-office, is my decided\r\nview of the case; and if you profit by the hint, you will do what I\r\nbelieve no public body ever did yet. Perhaps, therefore, the idea of\r\nsetting the fashion may possibly induce you to reconsider and rectify an\r\nabsurdity, which, while no inconvenience to you, is often a very great\r\none to those you employ. It is wonderful, the difference in the view\r\ntaken of affairs by actors on the spot and spectators at a distance. A\r\nman who sees a fellow-creature half crushed to death and crippled for\r\nlife by some horrible accident, is too often satisfied with little more\r\nthan a passing \"Good gracious!\" but if, on his returning homeward, some\r\ngigantic waggon-wheel scrunch the mere tip of his toes, or annihilate a\r\nbare inch of his nose, his ideas of the reality of an accident become\r\nimmensely enlarged.\r\n\r\nLet the Foreign Secretary try for a couple of days some such _régime_ as\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\n  5    A.M. Light fires, fetch water, and put kettle on.\r\n  6     \"   Dust room and make beds.\r\n  7     \"   Clean shoes, polish knives, and sand kitchen.\r\n  7:30  \"   Market for dinner.\r\n  8:30  \"   Breakfast.\r\n  9     \"   To Downing-street, light fires, and dust office.\r\n  10    \"   Sit down comfortably(?) to work.\r\n  1:30 P.M. Off to coal-hole for more coals.\r\n  4     \"   Sweep up, and go home.\r\n  5     \"   Off coat, up sleeves, and cook.\r\n  6:30  \"   Eat dinner.\r\n  7     \"   Wash up.\r\n  8     \"   Light your pipe, walk to window, and see your\r\n            colleague over the way, with a couple of Patagonian\r\n            footmen flying about amid a dozen guests, while, to\r\n            give additional zest to your feelings of enjoyment,\r\n            a couple of buxom lassies are peeping out of the\r\n            attics, and singing like crickets.\r\n  9     \"   Make your own reflections upon the Government\r\n            that dooms you to personal servitude, while your\r\n            colleague is allowed purchaseable service. Sleep\r\n            over the same, and repeat the foregoing _régime_ on\r\n            the second day; and, filled with the happy influences\r\n            so much cause for gratitude must inspire, give\r\n            reflection her full tether, and sleep over her again.\r\n            On the third morning, let your heart and brain\r\n            dictate a despatch upon the subject of your reflections\r\n            to all public servants in slave-holding communities,\r\n            and, while repudiating slavery, you will\r\n            find no difficulty in employing the services of the\r\n            slave, under peculiar circumstances, and with proper\r\n            restrictions.\r\n\r\nI embarked from Norfolk per steamer for Baltimore, and thence by rail\r\nthrough Philadelphia to New York. I took a day's hospitality among my\r\nkind friends at Baltimore. At Philadelphia I was in such a hurry to pass\r\non, that I exhibited what I fear many will consider a symptom of\r\ninveterate bachelorship; but truth bids me not attempt to cloak my\r\ndelinquency. Hear my confession:--\r\n\r\nMy friend Mr. Fisher, whose hospitality I had drawn most largely upon\r\nduring my previous stay, invited me to come and pay him and his charming\r\nlady a visit, at a delightful country house of his a few miles out of\r\ntown. Oh, no! that was impossible; my time was so limited; I had so much\r\nto see in the north and Canada. In vain he urged, with hearty warmth,\r\nthat I should spend only one night: it was quite impossible--quite. That\r\npoint being thoroughly settled, he said, \"It is a great pity you are so\r\npressed for time, because the trotting champion, 'Mac,' runs against a\r\nformidable antagonist, 'Tacony,' to-morrow.\" In half an hour I was in\r\nhis waggon, and in an hour and a half I was enjoying the warm greeting\r\nof his amiable wife in their country-house, the blush of shame and a\r\nguilty conscience tinging my cheeks as each word of welcome passed from\r\nher lips or flashed from her speaking eyes. Why did I thus act? Could I\r\nsay, in truth, \"'Twas not that I love thee less, but that I love Tacony\r\nmore?\" Far from it. Was it that I was steeped in ingratitude? I trust\r\nnot. Ladies, oh, ladies!--lovely creatures that you are--think not so\r\nharshly of a penitent bachelor. You have all read of one of your sex\r\nthrough whom Evil--which takes its name from, her--first came upon\r\nearth, and you know the motive power of that act was--curiosity. I plead\r\nguilty to that motive power on the present occasion; and, while throwing\r\nmyself unreservedly on your clemency, I freely offer myself as a target\r\nfor the censure of each one among you who, in the purity of truth can\r\nsay, \"I never felt such an influence in all my life.\" Reader, remember\r\nyou cannot be one of these, for the simple fact of casting your eyes\r\nover this page affords sufficient presumptive evidence for any court of\r\nlaw to bring you in guilty of a curiosity to know what the writer has to\r\nsay.--To resume.\r\n\r\nThe race-course at Philadelphia is a road on a perfect level, and a\r\ncircle of one mile; every stone is carefully removed, and it looks as\r\nsmooth and clean as a swept floor. The stand commands a perfect view of\r\nthe course; but its neglected appearance shows clearly that\r\ntrotting-matches here are not as fashionable as they used to be, though\r\nfar better attended than at New York. Upon the present occasion the\r\nexcitement was intense; you could detect it even in the increased vigour\r\nwith which the smoking and spitting was carried on. An antagonist had\r\nbeen found bold enough to measure speed with \"Mac\"--the great Mac who,\r\nwhile \"Whipping creation,\" was also said never to have let out his full\r\nspeed. He was thorough-bred, about fifteen and a half hands, and lighter\r\nbuilt than my raw-boned friend Tacony, and he had lately been sold for\r\n1600l. So sure did people apparently feel of Mac's easy victory, that\r\neven betting was out of the question. Unlike the Long Island affair, the\r\nriders appeared in jockey attire, and the whole thing was far better got\r\nup. Ladies, however, had long ceased to grace such scenes.\r\n\r\nVarious false starts were made, all on the part of Mac, who, trusting to\r\nthe bottom of blood, apparently endeavoured to ruffle Tacony's temper\r\nand weary him out a little. How futile were the efforts the sequel\r\nplainly showed. At length a start was effected, and away they went,\r\nTacony with his hind legs as far apart as the centre arch of Westminster\r\nBridge, and with strides that would almost clear the Bridgewater Canal.\r\nMac's rider soon found that, in trying to ginger Tacony's temper, he had\r\npeppered his own horse's, for he broke-up into a gallop twice. Old\r\nTacony and his rider had evidently got intimate since I had seen them at\r\nNew York, and they now thoroughly understood each other. On he went,\r\nwith giant strides; Mac fought bravely for the van, but could not get\r\nhis nose beyond Tacony's saddle-girth at the winning-post--time, 2m.\r\n25-1/2s.\r\n\r\nThen, followed the usual race-course accompaniments of cheers,\r\nsquabbles, growling, laughing, betting, drinking, &c. The public were\r\nnot convinced. Mac was still the favourite; the champion chaplet was not\r\nthus hastily to be plucked from his hitherto victorious brows. Half an\r\nhour's rest brought them again to the starting-post, where Mac repeated\r\nhis old tactics, and with similar bad success. Nothing could ruffle\r\nTacony, or produce one false step: he flew round the course, every\r\nstride like the ricochet of a 32lb. shot; his adversary broke-up again\r\nand again, losing both his temper and his place, and barely saved his\r\ndistance, as the gallant Tacony--his rider with a slack rein, and\r\npatting him on the neck--reached the winning-post--time, 2m. 25s. The\r\nshouts were long and loud; such time had never been made before by fair\r\ntrotting, and Tacony evidently could have done it in two, if not three\r\nseconds less. The fastest pacing ever accomplished before was 2m. 13s.,\r\nand the fastest trotting 2m. 26s. The triumph was complete; Tacony nobly\r\nwon the victorious garland; and as long as he and his rider go together,\r\nit will take, if not a rum 'un to look at, at all events a d----l to\r\ngo, ere he be forced to resign his championship.\r\n\r\nThe race over, waggons on two wheels and waggons on four wheels, with\r\ntrotters in them capable of going the mile in from 2m. 40s. to 3m. 20s.,\r\nbegan to shoot about in every direction, and your ears were assailed on\r\nall sides with \"G'lang, g'lang!\" and occasionally a frantic yell, to\r\nwhich some Jehu would give utterance by way of making some horse that\r\nwas passing him \"break-up.\" Thus ended the famous race between Mac and\r\nTac, which, by the way, gave me an opportunity of having a little fun\r\nwith some of my American friends, as I condoled with them on their\r\nchampion being beaten by a British subject; for, strange to say, Tac is\r\na Canadian horse. I therefore of course expressed the charitable wish\r\nthat an American horse might be found some day equal to the task of\r\nwearing the champion trotting crown(!)--I beg pardon, not crown, but,\r\nI suppose, cap of liberty. I need scarce say that it is not so much the\r\nhorse as the perfect teaming that produces the result; and all Tac's\r\ntraining is exclusively American, and received in a place not very far\r\nfrom Philadelphia, from which he gets his name. A friend gave me a lift\r\ninto Philadelphia, whence the iron horse speedily bore me to the great\r\nrepublican Babylon, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n_Home of the Pilgrim Fathers_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving made the necessary preparations, I again put myself behind the\r\nboiling kettle, _en route_ to the republican Athens. The day was\r\nintensely hot; even the natives required the windows open, and the dust\r\nbeing very lively, we soon became as powdered as a party going down to\r\nthe Derby in the ante-railway days. My curiosity was excited on the way,\r\nby seeing a body of men looking like a regiment of fox-hunters--all well\r\ngot up, fine stout fellows--who entered, and filled two of the\r\ncarriages. On inquiring who kept the hounds, and if they had good runs,\r\na sly smile stole across my friend's cheek as he told me they were\r\nmerely the firemen of the city going to fraternize with the ditto ditto\r\nof Boston. It stupidly never occurred to me to ask him whether any\r\nprovision was made in case of a quiet little fire developing itself\r\nduring their absence, for their number was legion, and as active,\r\ndaring, orderly-looking fellows as ever I set eyes upon. Jolly apopletic\r\naldermen of our capital may forsake the green fat of their soup-making\r\ndeity, to be feasted by their Parisian fraternity, without inconvenience\r\nto anybody, except it be to their fellow-passengers in the steamer upon\r\ntheir return, if they have been over-fed and have not tempest-tried\r\norgans of digestion. But a useful body like firemen migrating should, I\r\nconfess, have suggested to me the propriety of asking what substitutes\r\nwere left to perform, if need be, their useful duties; not having done\r\nso, I am constrained to leave this important point in its present\r\npainful obscurity.\r\n\r\nA thundering whistle and a cloud of steam announce the top is off the\r\nkettle, and that we have reached Boston. Wishing to take my own luggage\r\nin a hackney, I found that, however valuable for security the ticketing\r\nsystem may be, it was, under circumstances like mine at present,\r\npainfully trying to patience. In three-quarters of an hour, however, I\r\nmanaged to get hold of it, and then, by way of improving my temper, I\r\nascertained that one of my boxes was in a state of \"pretty considerable\r\nall mighty smash.\" At last I got off with my goods and chattels, and\r\nhaving seen quite enough of the American palace-hotels and their\r\nbountifully-spread tables, and of the unrivalled energy with which the\r\nmeals are despatched; remembering, also, how frequently the drum of my\r\nears had been distracted by the eternal rattling and crackling of plates\r\nand dishes for a couple of hundred people, and how my olfactories had\r\nsuffered from the mixed odours of the kitchen produce, I declined going\r\nto the palatial Revere House, which is one of the best hotels in the\r\nUnion, and put up at a house of less pretensions, where I found both\r\nquiet and comfort.\r\n\r\nTo write a description of Boston, when so many others have done so far\r\nbetter than I can pretend to do, and when voluminous gazetteers record\r\nalmost every particular, would be drawing most unreasonably upon the\r\npatience of a reader, and might further be considered as inferring a\r\ndoubt of his acquaintance with, I might almost say, a hackneyed subject.\r\nI shall, therefore, only inflict a few short observations to refresh his\r\nmemory. The most striking feature in Boston, to my mind, is the common\r\nor park, inasmuch as it is the only piece of ground in or attached to\r\nany city which I saw deserving the name of a park. It was originally a\r\ntown cow-pasture, and called the Tower Fields. The size is about fifty\r\nacres; it is surrounded with an iron fencing, and, although not large,\r\nthe lay of the ground is very pretty. It contains some very fine old\r\ntrees, which every traveller in America must know are a great rarity in\r\nthe neighbourhood of any populous town. It is overlooked by the\r\nState-house, which is built upon Beacon Hill, just outside the highest\r\nextremity of the park, and from the top of which a splendid panoramic\r\nview of the whole town and neighbourhood is obtained. The State-house is\r\na fine building in itself, and contains one of Chantrey's best\r\nworks--the statue of Washington. The most interesting building in\r\nBoston, to the Americans, is, undoubtedly, Faneuil Hall, called also the\r\n\"Cradle of Liberty.\" Within those walls the stern oratory of noble\r\nhearts striving to be free, and daring to strike for it, was listened to\r\nby thousands, in whose breasts a ready response was found, and who,\r\ncatching the glowing enthusiasm of the orators, determined rather to be\r\nrebels and free than subjects and slaves: the sequel is matter of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nI shall not tax the temper of my reader by going through any further\r\nlist of the public buildings, which are sufficiently known to those who\r\ntake an interest in this flourishing community; but I must hasten to\r\napologize for my ingratitude in not sooner acknowledging that most\r\npleasing feature in every traveller's experience in America, which, I\r\nneed hardly say, is hospitality.\r\n\r\nScarce was my half-smashed box landed at the hotel, when my young\r\nAmerican friend, who came from England with our party, appeared to\r\nwelcome me--perhaps to atone for the lion's share of champagne he had\r\nenjoyed at our table on board the steamer. Then he introduced me to\r\nanother, and another introduced me to another another, and another\r\nanother introduced me to another another another, and so on, till I\r\nbegan to feel I must know the _élite_ of Boston. Club-doors flew open,\r\nchampagne-corks flew out, cicerones, pedal and vehicular, were ever\r\nready to guide me by day and feed me by night; and though there are no\r\ndrones in a Yankee hive, so thoroughly did they dedicate themselves to\r\nmy comfort and amusement, that a person ignorant of the true state of\r\nthings might have fancied they were as idle and occupationless as the\r\ncigar-puffers who adorn some of our metropolitan-club steps, the envy of\r\npassing butcher-boys and the liberal distributors of cigar-ends to\r\nunwashed youths who hang about ready to pounce upon the delicious and\r\nrejected morsels. Among other gentlemen whose acquaintance I had the\r\npleasure of making, and whose hospitalities, of course, I enjoyed, I may\r\nmention Mr. Prescott and Mr. Ticknor, the former highly appreciated in\r\nthe old country, and both so widely known and so justly esteemed in the\r\nworld of literature. As I consider such men public property, I make no\r\napology for using their names, while in so doing I feel I am best\r\nconveying to the reader some idea of the society which a traveller meets\r\nwith in Yankee Athens.\r\n\r\nThe town has one charm to me, which it shares in common with Baltimore.\r\nNot only is it built on undulating ground, but there are old parts\r\nremaining, whereby the eye is relieved from the tiring monotony of broad\r\nand straight streets, while the newer parts form a pleasing variety, and\r\nbear gratifying evidence of the increasing wealth of its intelligent\r\nand industrious population. Then, again, the neighbourhood of the town\r\nhas a charm for a wanderer from the old country; the roads are\r\nexcellent, the fields and gardens are tidied up, creepers are led up the\r\ncottage walls, suburban villas abound, everything looks more clean, more\r\n_soigné_, more snug, more filled and settled than the neighbourhood of\r\nany other city I visited in America, and thus forces back upon the mind\r\nassociations and reflections of dear old home.\r\n\r\nHaving enjoyed a visit to a friend in one of the suburban villas inland,\r\nto which he drove me in his light waggon, another vehicular cicerone\r\ninsisted that I should drive out to his uncle's, and spend a day at his\r\nmarine villa, about twelve miles distant. I joyfully assented to so\r\npleasant a proposition, and, \"hitching a three-forty before a light\r\nwaggon\"--as the term is in America--we were soon bowling away merrily\r\nalong a capital road. A pleasant drive of nine miles brought us to a\r\nlittle town called Lynn, after Lynn Regis in England, from which place\r\nsome of the early settlers came. How often has the traveller to regret\r\nthe annihilation of the wild old Indian names, and the substitution of\r\nappellatives from every creek and corner of the older continents; with\r\nPoquanum, Sagamore, Wenepoykin, with Susquehanna, Wyoming, Miami, and a\r\nthousand other such of every length and sound, all cut-and-dried to\r\nhand, it is more than a pity to see so great a country plagiarizing in\r\nsuch a wholesale manner Pekins, Cantons, Turing, Troys, Carmels,\r\nEmmauses, Cairos, and a myriad other such borrowed plumes, plucked from\r\nEurope, Asia, and Africa, and hustled higgledy-piggledy side by side,\r\nwithout a single element or association to justify the uncalled-for\r\nrobbery.\r\n\r\nForgive me, reader,--all this digression comes from my wishing Lynn had\r\nkept its old Indian name of Saugus; from such little acorns will such\r\ngreat oak-trees spring.--To resume. The said town of Lynn supplies\r\nunderstandings to a very respectable number of human beings, and may be\r\ncalled a gigantic shoemaker's shop, everything being on the gigantic\r\nscale in America. It employs 11,000, out of its total population of\r\n14,000, in that trade, and produces annually nearly 5,000,000 of women's\r\nand children's boots, shoes, and gaiters, investing in the business a\r\ncapital amounting to 250,000l. Moses and Son, Hyam and Co., Nicoll\r\nand Co., and the whole of the three-halfpence-a-shirt-paying\r\ncapitalists, can show nothing like my shoemakers' shop, \"fix it how you\r\nwill,\"--as they say in the Great Republic.\r\n\r\nThe three-forty trotter soon left boots, shoes, and all behind, and\r\ndeposited us at the door of the uncle's villa, where a friendly hand\r\nwelcomed us to its hospitalities. It was very prettily situated upon a\r\ncliff overlooking Massachusetts Bay, in which said cliff a zigzag\r\nstepway was cut down to the water, for the convenience of bathing. The\r\ngrounds were nicely laid out and planted, and promised in time to be\r\nwell wooded, if the ocean breeze driving upon them did not lay an\r\nembargo upon their growth, in the same heartless manner as it does upon\r\nthe west coast of Scotland, where, the moment a tree gets higher than a\r\nmop handle, its top becomes curved over by the gales, with the same\r\ngraceful sweep as that which a successful stable-boy gives a birch broom\r\nafter a day's soaking. I hope, for my hospitable friend's sake, it may\r\nnot prove true in his case; but I saw an ostrich-feathery curve upon the\r\ntops of some of his trees, which looked ominous. Having spent a very\r\npleasant day, and enjoyed good cheer and good company, Three-forty was\r\nagain \"hitched to;\" joined hands announced the parting moment had\r\narrived; wreaths of smoke from fragrant Havanas ascended like incense\r\nfrom the shrine of Adieu; \"G'lang\"--the note of advance--was sounded;\r\nThree-forty sprang to the word of command; friends, shoes, and\r\nshoemakers were soon tailed of; and ere long your humble servant was\r\nnestling his nose in his pillow at Boston.\r\n\r\nHearing that the drama was investing its talent in Abolitionism, I went\r\none evening to the theatre, to see if I could extract as much fun from\r\nthe metropolis of a free state as I had previously obtained from the\r\ncapital of slave-holding Maryland; for I knew the Americans, both North\r\nand South, were as ticklish as young ladies. I found very much the same\r\nstyle of thing as at Baltimore, except that her abolitionist highness,\r\nthe Duchess of Southernblack, did not appear on the stage by deputy; but\r\nas an atonement for the omission, you had a genuine Yankee abolitionist;\r\npoor Uncle Tom and his fraternity were duly licked and bullied by a\r\ncouple of heartless Southern nigger-drivers; and while their victims\r\nwere writhing in agony, a genuine abolitionist comes on the stage and\r\nwhops the two nigger-drivers, amid shouts of applause. The suppliant\r\nSoutherners, midst sobs and tears, plead for mercy, and in vain, until\r\nthe happy thought occurs to one of them, to break forth into a wondrous\r\ntale of the atrocities inflicted upon the starving and naked slaves of\r\nEnglish mines and factories, proving by contrast the superior happiness\r\nof the nigger and the greater mercifulness of his treatment. The\r\nindignant abolitionist drops the upraised cowhide, the sobs and tears of\r\nthe Southerners cease, the whole house thunders forth the ecstasy of its\r\ndelight, the curtain drops, and the enchanted audience adjourn to the\r\noyster saloons, vividly impressed with British brutality, the charms of\r\nslavery, and the superiority of Abolitionism.\r\n\r\nHow strange, that in a country like this, boasting of its education, and\r\ncertainly with every facility for its prosecution--how strange, that in\r\nthe very Athens of the Republic, the deluded masses should exhibit as\r\ncomplete ignorance as you could find in the gallery of any\r\ntwopenny-halfpenny metropolitan theatre of the old country!\r\n\r\nAnother of the lions of Boston which I determined to witness, if\r\npossible, was \"spirit-rapping.\" A friend undertook the arrangement for\r\nme; but so fully were the hours of the exhibitor taken up, that it was\r\nfive days before we could obtain a spare hour. At length the time\r\narrived, and, fortified with a good dinner and a skinful of \"Mumm\r\nCabinet,\" we proceeded to the witch's den. The witch was a clean and\r\ndecent-looking girl about twenty, rather thin, and apparently very\r\nexhausted; gradually a party of ten assembled, and we gathered round the\r\nwitch's table. The majority were ladies--those adorers of the\r\nmarvellous! The names of friends were called for; the ladies took the\r\nalphabet, and running over it with the point of a pencil, the spirit\r\nrapped as the wished-for letter was reached. John Davis was soon spelt,\r\neach letter probably having been indicated by the tremulous touch of\r\naffectionate hope. Harriet Mercer was then rapped out by the obliging\r\nspirit. The pencil and the alphabet were then handed to me, and the\r\nspirit being asked if it would answer my inquiries, and a most\r\nsatisfactory \"Yes\" being rapped out, I proceeded to put its powers to\r\nthe test. I concentrated my thoughts upon a Mr. L---- and his shop in\r\nFleet-street, with both of which being thoroughly familiar I had no\r\ndifficulty in fixing my attention upon them. The pencil was put in\r\nmotion, powerful rappings were heard as it touched the D. I kept my\r\ngravity, and went on again and again, till the name of the illustrious\r\nduke, whose death the civilized world was then deploring with every\r\ntoken of respect, was fully spelt out. The witch was in despair; she\r\ntried again and again to summon the rebellious spirit, but it would not\r\ncome. At last, a gentleman present, and who evidently was an _habitué_\r\nof the witch's den, proposed that the refractory spirit should be asked\r\nif any of the company were objectionable to it. This being done, a\r\nrattling \"Yes\" came forth, upon which each person asked in succession,\r\n\"Am I objectionable to you?\" There was a dead silence until it came to\r\nmy friend and myself, to each of whom it gave a most rappingly emphatic\r\n\"Yes.\" Accordingly, we rose and left the field to those whose greater\r\ngullibility rendered them more plastic objects for working upon. Never\r\nin my life did I witness greater humbug; and yet so intense was the\r\nanxiety of the Boston public to witness the miracle, that during all the\r\nday and half the night the spirit was being invoked by the witch, into\r\nwhose pockets were pouring the dollars of thousands of greater gabies\r\nthan myself, for many went away believers, receiving the first germs of\r\nimpressions which led them to a Lunatic Asylum, or an early grave, as\r\nvarious statistics in America prove most painfully.\r\n\r\nTo show the extent to which belief in these absurdities goes, I subjoin\r\nan extract from a paper, by which it appears that even the solemnities\r\nof a funeral cannot sober the minds of their deluded followers. Mr.\r\nCalvin R. Brown--better known as the husband of Mrs. Anne L. Fish, a\r\nfamous \"spirit medium\" in New York--having died, we read the following\r\nnotice of the funeral:--\"After prayer, the Rev. S. Brittan delivered an\r\naddress, in which he dwelt with much earnestness upon the superiority of\r\nthe life of the spirit, as compared with that of the body. At various\r\npoints in his address there were rappings, sometimes apparently on the\r\nbottom of the coffin, and at others upon the floor, as if in response to\r\nthe sentiments uttered. After concluding his address, Professor Brittan\r\nread a communication purporting to have come from the deceased after his\r\nentrance into the spirit world. While it was being read, the reporter\r\nstates that the rappings were distinctly heard. Several friends then\r\nsang, \"Come, ye disconsolate,\" after which the Rev. Mr. Denning made a\r\nfew remarks, during which the rappings were more audible than before.\r\nOther ceremonies closed the funeral. The whole party, preachers,\r\nphysicians, and all, were spiritualists,\" &c.\r\n\r\nBut I have before me a letter written by Judge Edmonds, which is a more\r\npainful exemplification of the insanity superinduced by giving way to\r\nthese absurdities; in that document you will find him deliberately\r\nstating, that he saw heavy tables flying about without touch, like the\r\nleaves in autumn; bells walking off shelves and ringing themselves, &c.\r\nAlso, you will find him classing among his co-believers \"Doctors,\r\nlawyers, clergymen, a Protestant bishop, a learned and reverend\r\npresident of a college, judges of higher courts, members of congress,\r\nforeign ambassadors (I hope not Mr. Crampton), and ex-members of the\r\nUnited States Senate.\"\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the old country will, no doubt, be astonished to hear that\r\ntheir sisters of the younger country have medical colleges in various\r\nStates; but, I believe, mostly in the northern ones. To what extent\r\ntheir studies in the healing art are carried, I cannot precisely inform\r\nthem; it most probably will not stop at combinations of salts and senna,\r\nor spreading plasters--for which previous nursery practice with bread\r\nand butter might eminently qualify them. How deeply they will dive into\r\nthe mysteries of anatomy, unravelling the tangled web of veins and\r\narteries, and mastering the intricacies of the ganglionic centre; or how\r\nfar they will practise the subjugation of their feelings, whether only\r\nenough to whip off some pet finger and darling little toe, or whether\r\nsufficiently to perform more important operations, even such as Sydney\r\nSmith declared a courageous little prime minister was ready to undertake\r\nat a minute's notice; these are questions which I cannot answer: but one\r\nthing is clear, the wedge is entered. How far it will be driven in, time\r\nmust show.[AK]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote AK: The Massachusetts Legislature, in a recent session,\r\nappropriated funds to the New England Female Medical College, located in\r\nBoston, to pay forty students for five years; and I have since observed\r\nin a Boston paper that there are twenty lady physicians, who, confining\r\nthemselves to midwifery and diseases of their own sex, have a fair\r\npractice, and enjoy the confidence of the families they visit.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n_Teaching of Youth, and a Model Jail_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI must now turn to a more important and interesting feature of Boston,\r\nviz., education. We all remember how the religious persecution in the\r\nreign of Elizabeth, fettering men's consciences, drove a devoted band of\r\ndeep-thinking Christians into caves of concealment, and how, after much\r\nperil, they escaped in 1609, in the reign of James the First, to\r\nAmsterdam, under the leadership of the noble-hearted J. Robinson, where,\r\nafter sighing long for a return beneath the flag of the country of their\r\nbirth, they obtained a charter from the Virginia Company. The first\r\ndivision of them embarked on board \"The Mayflower,\" a small vessel of\r\n180 tons, and sailed from Plymouth, 6th September, 1620, landing in\r\ntheir new and barren home upon the 11th of December. These were the\r\nsturdy champions of liberty of conscience, from whom the New Englanders\r\nmay be said to have sprung, and who have leavened the whole community\r\nwith their energy and indomitable spirit: such men knew how to\r\nappreciate education, as the leveller of oppression and the bulwark of\r\nfreedom; and it is, therefore, no wonder that the American Republic\r\nrecognises them as the worthy pioneers of that noble feature in their\r\ninstitutions--free education, supplied to all by the State.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, see how far their descendants are treading in their\r\nfootsteps upon this point. I speak of Boston and its 150,000\r\ninhabitants, not of the State. And first, it is important to observe,\r\nthat the strict provisions of the State requirements would be met by\r\nthree schools, and three teachers with assistants, whose salaries would\r\namount to 900l. The actual provision made by this energetic community,\r\nis,--Schools: 1 Latin, 1 English, 22 grammar, 194 primary,--total for\r\nsalaries, 37,000l. And that it may not be supposed the salaries are\r\ngreat prizes, it is important to remark, that there are 65 male\r\nteachers, and about 300 female teachers. The highest paid are\r\nhead-masters of Latin and English schools, 490l.; sub-masters of same,\r\nand head-masters of grammar, 300l.; ushers, assistants, &c., from\r\n50l. to 160l.; and female teachers, from 45l. to 60l., with\r\n5l. additional for care of the rooms.\r\n\r\nAll the primary schools have female teachers; and the feeling is\r\nstrongly in favour of females for instructing the very young, their\r\npatience and kindness being less likely to foster feelings of dread and\r\ndislike.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of taxes raised in the city is, in round numbers,\r\n250,000l.; of which 65,000l., or more than one-fourth, is devoted to\r\nschools. The total value of all public school estates of Boston, up to\r\nMay, 1851, was 260,000l.; and the salary of the head-master is, within\r\na few pounds, equal to that of the governor of the State.\r\n\r\nSay, then, reader, has some portion of the spirit of the Pilgrim Fathers\r\ndescended to the present generation, or not?--a population of 150,000\r\ndevoting 260,000l. to education.\r\n\r\nWherever parents are unable to provide books, &c., the children are\r\nsupplied with the use of them _gratis_. All corporal punishment is\r\nstrongly discouraged, but not prohibited; and all inflictions thereof\r\nare recorded for the information of the Visiting Board. Having omitted\r\nto make personal inquiries on the spot, I obtained, through the kindness\r\nof Mr. Ticknor, answers to the following questions on the point of\r\nreligious instruction:--\r\n\r\n1. \"Are the pupils at your normal schools obliged to receive religious\r\ninstruction from some minister, and to attend some place of worship; or\r\nmay they, if they prefer, receive no such instruction, and attend no\r\nchurch?\"\r\n\r\n\"The State has put the normal schools under the charge of the Board of\r\nEducation, with no special law or instructions. The Board of Education\r\nendeavours to act on exactly the same principles as those which the law\r\nhas laid down with respect to the common schools. The Board requires\r\nthat the pupils of the normal schools attend some place of worship, the\r\npupil making his own choice. These schools are opened every morning with\r\nreading the Scriptures, singing, and prayer. The moral conduct of the\r\npupils is carefully watched over, and instruction is given in respect to\r\nthe best methods of training the young in religion and morals. The\r\nreligious teaching is ethical, not doctrinal.\"\r\n\r\n2. \"Are the children at your common schools obliged to receive some\r\nreligious instruction, or if their parents express a wish they should\r\nnot receive any at school, is the wish complied with?\"\r\n\r\n\"The law requires all teachers to instruct their pupils 'in the\r\nprinciples of piety,' and forbids any sectarian books to be introduced\r\ninto the public schools. The school committees of each town prescribe\r\nthe class-books to be used, and commonly make the Bible one of those\r\nbooks. The teacher is expected to follow the law in respect to teaching\r\nthe principles of piety, without any instruction from the school\r\ncommittee, and is almost always allowed to do this in his own way,\r\nunless he is guilty of some impropriety, in which case the school\r\ncommittee interferes. He usually has devotional exercises at the opening\r\nof the school, and reads the Scriptures, or causes them to be read, as\r\nan act of worship, whether they are prescribed by the committee or not.\r\nMany teachers take that occasion to remark upon topics of morality, and\r\nthereby aim to prevent misconduct. Indeed, the Bible is much relied on\r\nas a means of discipline rather for preventing wrong-doing, than for\r\ncorrecting it.\r\n\r\n\"No minister, as such, gives religious instruction in any of our public\r\nschools. Ministers are commonly on the school committees, and when\r\nvisiting the schools, as committees, exhort the children to good\r\nbehaviour, and to a religious life.\r\n\r\n\"No cases are known of parents wishing their children to be excused from\r\nsuch religious instruction, except with the Catholics, who desire that\r\ntheir children be excused from the devotional exercises, especially from\r\nreading the Protestant version of the Bible. Even this is very rare\r\nwhere the teacher himself reads the Scriptures in connexion with other\r\ndevotional exercises. It occurs most frequently where the children are\r\nrequired to use the Bible themselves, either in devotional exercises or\r\nin a reading lesson. But those wishes are not often regarded, because\r\nthe committee has a legal right to prescribe the Bible as a school-book,\r\nand to require all the pupils to comply with all the regulations of the\r\nschool. In some few instances, committees have thought it expedient to\r\nallow the Douay version to be used by Catholic children; but it amounts\r\nto nothing, as it is an abstract point started by the priests, for which\r\nparents care but little; besides, it is objected that the Douay version\r\nwith its glosses is 'a sectarian book,' whereas the common English\r\nversion without note or comment is not.\"\r\n\r\nScholars desirous of entering the higher schools are generally required\r\nto pass through the lower, and bring therefrom certificates of capacity\r\nand conduct. In the statute of the State, with reference to education,\r\nall professors, tutors, instructors, &c., are enjoined to impress upon\r\nthe minds of those committed to their charge \"the principles of piety,\r\njustice, a sacred regard to truth, and love of their country.\" Among the\r\nvarious subjects in connexion with education, in which instruction is\r\ngiven in these schools, it may be as well to mention one, which, I\r\nbelieve, is all but totally neglected in England. By legislative\r\nenactment, section 2, \"All school-teachers shall hereafter be examined\r\nin their knowledge of the elementary principles of physiology and\r\nhygiène, and their ability to give instructions in the same.\"\r\n\r\nThe School Committee consists of two members from each of the twelve\r\nwards of the city, chosen annually, and assisted by the Mayor and\r\nPresident of the Common Council. The average expense of each scholar at\r\nthe primary schools is 25s. per annum, at the higher schools three\r\nguineas. Under the foregoing system, 12,000 children are instructed\r\nannually at the primary schools, and 10,000 at the higher schools, which\r\naggregate of 22,000 will give an attendance of nearly 70 per cent. upon\r\nall children between the ages of five and fifteen, to whom the avenues\r\nof knowledge, from the lisping letters of infancy to the highest\r\nbranches of philosophy, are freely opened.\r\n\r\nThrough the kindness of Mr. B. Seaver, the Mayor of Boston, I was\r\nenabled to visit several of these schools, the cleanliness of which, as\r\nwell as their good ventilation, was most satisfactory. The plan adopted\r\nhere, of having the stools made of iron and screwed on to the floor,\r\nwith a wooden seat fixed on the top for each pupil, and a separate desk\r\nfor every two, struck me as admirably calculated to improve ventilation\r\nand check sky-larking and noise. The number of public schools in the\r\nwhole State is 4056, which are open for seven months and a half in the\r\nyear, and the average attendance of scholars is 145,000; besides which,\r\nthere are 749 private schools, with 16,000 scholars. It is a curious\r\nfact, and bears strong testimony to the efficiency of the public\r\nschools, that while they have increased by 69 during the year, the\r\nprivate schools have decreased by 36. The foregoing sketch is from the\r\nofficial Reports, printed at Boston in 1853.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these schools, there are four colleges, three theological\r\nseminaries, and two medical schools. Of these I shall only notice one of\r\nthe colleges, which I visited, and which enjoys a high reputation--viz.,\r\nHarvard College, or Cambridge, as it is sometimes called, from the\r\nvillage where it is situated. The history of this college is a wholesome\r\nproof how a small institution, if duly fostered by a nation, may\r\neventually repay future generations with liberal interest. Established\r\nin 1636, by a vote of 400l., it obtained the name of Harvard, from the\r\nbequeathment by a reverend gentleman of that name, A.D. 1638, of the sum\r\nof 780l. and 300 volumes. Its property now amounts to upwards of\r\n100,000l., and it is divided into five departments--collegiate, law,\r\nmedical, theological, and scientific--affording education to 652\r\nstudents, of whom one half are undergraduates. There are forty-five\r\ninstructors, all men of unquestionable attainments, and capable of\r\nleading the students up to the highest steps of every branch of\r\nknowledge; the necessary expenses of a student are about 45l. a year;\r\nthe fee for a master of arts, including the diploma, is 1l. sterling.\r\n\r\nMeritorious students, whose circumstances require it, are allowed, at\r\nthe discretion of the Faculty, to be absent for thirteen weeks,\r\nincluding the winter vacation, for the purpose of teaching schools.\r\nParents who think their sons unable to take care of their own money, may\r\nsend it to a patron duly appointed by the college, who will then pay all\r\nbills and keep the accounts, receiving, as compensation two and a half\r\nper cent. I think the expenses of this establishment will astonish those\r\nwho have had to \"pay the piper\" for a smart young man at Oxford, as much\r\nas the said young man would have been astonished, had his allowance,\r\nwhile there, been paid into the hands of some prudent and trusty\r\npatron. Tandems and tin horns would have been rather at a discount--_cum\r\npluribus aliis_.\r\n\r\nThe college has a look of antiquity, which is particularly pleasant in a\r\nland where almost everything is spick-and-span new; but the rooms I\r\nthought low and stuffy, and the walls and passages had a neglected\r\nplaster-broken appearance. There are some very fine old trees in the\r\ngreen, which, throwing their shade over the time-worn building, help to\r\ngive it a venerable appearance. A new school of science has just been\r\nbuilt by the liberality of Mr. Lawrence,[AL] late Minister of the United\r\nStates in this country; and I may add that the wealth and prosperity of\r\nthe college are almost entirely due to private liberality.\r\n\r\nAs the phonetic system of education has been made a subject of so much\r\ndiscussion in the United States, I make no apology for inserting the\r\nfollowing lengthy observations thereon. A joint committee on education,\r\nappointed to inquire into its merits by the Senate, in 1851, reported\r\nthat there was evidence tending to show--\"That it will enable the pupil\r\nto learn to read phonetically in one-tenth of the time ordinarily\r\nemployed. That it will enable the learner to read the common type in\r\none-fourth of the time necessary according to the usual mode of\r\ninstruction. That its acquisition leads the pupil to the correct\r\npronunciation of every word. That it will present to the missionary a\r\nsuperior alphabet for the representation of hitherto unwritten\r\nlanguages,\" &c. A similar committee, to whom the question was referred\r\nby the House of Representatives in 1852, state that during the past year\r\nthe system had been tried in twelve public schools, and that, according\r\nto the testimony of the teachers, children evinced greater attachment to\r\ntheir books, and learnt to read with comparative ease; and they conclude\r\ntheir report in these words:--\"Impressed with the importance of the\r\nphonetic system, which, if primarily learnt, according to the testimony\r\npresented, would save two years of time to each of the two hundred\r\nthousand children in the State, the committee would recommend to school\r\ncommittees and teachers, the introduction of the phonetic system of\r\ninstruction into all the primary schools of the State, for the purpose\r\nof teaching the reading and spelling of the common orthography, with an\r\nenunciation which can rarely be secured by the usual method, and with a\r\nsaving of time and labour to both teachers and pupils, which will enable\r\nthe latter to advance in physical and moral education alone until they\r\nare six years of age, without any permanent loss in the information they\r\nwill ultimately obtain.\"\r\n\r\nOne gentleman of the minority of the committee sent in a very strong\r\nreport condemning the system. He declares \"the system is nothing but an\r\nabsurd attempt to mystify and perplex a subject, which ought to be left\r\nplain and clear to the common apprehensions of common men.\" Further on\r\nhe states, \"No human ingenuity can show a reason for believing that the\r\nway to learn the true alphabet, is first to study a false alphabet; that\r\nthe way to speak words rightly, is to begin by spelling them wrong; that\r\nthe way to teach the right use of a letter, is to begin by giving a\r\nfalse account of a letter. Yet the phonetic system, so far as it is\r\nanything, is precisely this.\" Then, again, with reference to the eight\r\nspecimen scholars, taken from a school of fifty, and who were exhibited,\r\nhe observes, \"they were the same as those who were examined a year ago;\r\nnothing is said of the other forty-two. It is not necessary to say\r\nanything more of the character of such evidence as this;\" and he winds\r\nup by observing: \"Such a mode of instruction would, in his opinion,\r\nwaste both the time and the labour employed upon it, and complicate and\r\nembarrass a study, which in its true shape is perfectly simple and\r\nclear.\" The following old anecdote would rather tend to prove that\r\nspelling and reading were not either \"simple or clear\" to a Lancashire\r\njudge, who, having asked the name of a witness, and not catching the\r\nword exactly, desired him to spell it, which he proceeded to do\r\nthus:--\"O double T, I double U, E double L, double U, double O, D.\" The\r\nlearned judge laid down his pen in astonishment, and after two or three\r\nunsuccessful efforts, at last declared he was unable to record it--so\r\npuzzled was he with the \"simple\" spelling of that clear name--Ottiwell\r\nWood.\r\n\r\nIn the _Massachusetts Teacher_ of January, 1853, there is the report of\r\na committee, in which they state \"that children taught solely by the\r\nphonetic system, and only twenty minutes each day, outstripped all their\r\ncompeers.\" They further add, that \"the phonetic system, thus beneficial\r\nin its effects, has been introduced into one hundred and nineteen public\r\nand five private schools, and that they have reason to believe, that no\r\ncommittee ever appointed to examine its merits have ever reported\r\nadverse to it;\" and they conclude by strongly \"recommending teachers to\r\ntest the merits of the System by actual trial in their schools.\" Then\r\nagain, in the following number of their journal, they strongly condemn\r\nthe system as both useless and impracticable.\r\n\r\nHaving carefully weighed the arguments on both sides, I am led to the\r\nconclusion, that the objections of those who condemn the system are\r\npartly owing to the fact, that while reaching their present advanced\r\nstate of knowledge, they have entirely forgotten their own struggles,\r\nand are thus insensibly led to overlook the confusion and difficulty\r\nwhich must ever arise in the infant mind, where similar combinations\r\nproduce similar sounds. An infant mind is incapable of grasping\r\ndifferences, but understands readily simple facts; if what meets the eye\r\nrepresent a certain fixed sound, the infant readily acquires that sound;\r\nbut if the eye rest on _o, u, g, h,_ as a combination, and the endeavour\r\nis made to teach him the endless varieties of sound produced thereby,\r\nhis little mind becomes puzzled, his ideas of truth become confused, his\r\nmemory becomes distrusted, and his powers of reading become retarded by\r\nthe time occupied in the--to him--most uninteresting task of learning a\r\nhost of unmeaning sounds. The inevitable consequence is that the poor\r\nlittle victim becomes disheartened, rendering a considerable amount of\r\nadditional trouble and--which is far more difficult to find--patience\r\nnecessary upon the part of the teacher.\r\n\r\nCommon sense points out, that the reading of phonetic words must be more\r\neasily learnt than the reading of the aphonetic words, of which our\r\nlanguage is essentially composed. The real question is simply\r\nthis,--Does the infant mind advance with such rapidity under phonetic\r\nteaching, as to enable it at a certain age to transfer its powers to\r\northodox orthography, and reach a given point of knowledge therein,\r\nwith less trouble, and in a shorter space of time, than those infants\r\ndo who are educated upon the old system? If phonetic teaching has this\r\neffect, it is an inestimable boon, and if not, it is a complete\r\nhumbug.[AM] It should also be borne in mind, that the same arguments\r\nwhich hold good in the case of infants will apply also, in a great\r\ndegree, to adults who wish to learn to read, and to foreigners\r\ncommencing the study of our language. Whether any further use of\r\nphonetics is either desirable or practicable, would be a discussion out\r\nof place in these pages.\r\n\r\nWhen any startling novelty is proposed, enthusiasts carry their advocacy\r\nof it so far as often to injure the cause they wish to serve: on the\r\nother hand, too many of the educated portion of the community are so\r\nstrenuously opposed to innovation, as to raise difficulties rather than\r\nremove them. Has not the common sense of the age been long calling for\r\nchanges in the law of partnership, divorce, &c., and is not some\r\ndifficulty always arising? Has not the commercial world been crying\r\naloud for decimal coinage and decimal weights and measures, and are not\r\neducated men constantly finding some objections, and will they not\r\ncontinue to do so, until some giant mind springs up able to grasp the\r\nherculean task, and force the boon upon the community? Were not\r\nsteamboats and railways long opposed as being little better than insane\r\nvisions? Did not Doctor Lardner prove to demonstration that railway\r\ncarriages could never go more than twenty miles an hour, owing to the\r\nlaws of resistance, friction, &c., and did not Brunel take the breath\r\nout of him, and the pith out of his arguments, by carrying the learned\r\ndemonstrator with him on a locomotive, and whisking him ten miles out of\r\nLondon in as many minutes? When I see that among so intelligent and\r\npractical a people as the New Englanders--a people whose thoughts and\r\nenergies are so largely devoted to education--one hundred and nineteen\r\nschools have adopted the phonetic system, I cannot but look back to the\r\ninfancy of steam, and conclude, that there must be more advantages in\r\nthat system than its opponents seem disposed to allow it to possess.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Council on Education in England, to whom the funds\r\nset apart for educational purposes are, intrusted, authorized the\r\nprinting of phonetic books for schools some years since; but authorizing\r\nbooks without training masters to teach them, is about as useful as\r\nputting engines into a ship, without supplying engineers to work them.\r\nBesides which, their phonetic system was in itself confusing and\r\nobjectionable; they have also informed the public, that the system, in\r\nvarious forms, is almost universally adopted in the elementary schools\r\nof Holland, Prussia, and Germany.[AN]\r\n\r\nI should also mention that other systems have been tried both in England\r\nand Scotland, and that those teachers who employ them speak highly of\r\ntheir advantages, especially in the latter country. I have now a paper\r\nbefore me, called _The Reading Reformer_, in which I find the following\r\nsentence, which tends to show that the system is approved of in France\r\nin the highest quarters:--\"The phonetic method of primary instruction is\r\nused in the 5th regiment of the line, the 12th Light, the Penitentiary\r\nof St. Germain, and the House of Correction for young prisoners. The\r\nMinister of War has ordered that French should be taught by this method\r\nto the young Arabs, in the three schools of Algiers, Oran, and\r\nPhilipville.\"\r\n\r\nOne great mistake has been made by the champions of this mode of\r\nteaching, which is more fatal to its success, in my opinion, than any\r\ndifficulty raised by its opponents, and that is the adoption by each\r\nchampion of his own phonetic alphabet; and for which he claims a\r\nsuperiority over the alphabets of others. The absurdity of this\r\nperpetual strife must be palpable. If a Fireworshipper were to be\r\nconverted, what hopes of success would there be if a Mormonite and a\r\nMussulman were placed on one side of him, and a Free Kirk man and a\r\nJesuit on the other? The public, as regards phonetic teaching, are\r\nprecisely in that Fireworshipper's position. Reader, you must form your\r\nown opinion: I offer none. And now, with your permission, we will quit\r\nthe region of speculation and return to sober fact.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking buildings I visited during my stay at Boston\r\nwas the jail; the airiness and cleanliness were both perfect, and the\r\narrangement was to me totally novel. Independent of the ground outside,\r\nwhich is walled all round, the jail itself is built under a large outer\r\ncase, affording abundance of light and ventilation. This outer building\r\nforms a corridor all round the jail, affording protection to the keepers\r\nfrom all weathers, and thus enables them to keep an efficient watch over\r\nthe inmates. Supposing any prisoner to escape from his cell, he is still\r\nhemmed in by this outer case, which has only one door, so situated that\r\nno one can approach it without being seen from a considerable distance;\r\nand, even if these difficulties be overcome, the outer wall common to\r\nall prisons still remains. As far as I could learn, no prisoner has ever\r\nbeen able to force his way out. At night a blaze of gas in the outer\r\nhall lights all the dormitories and the corridor which runs round\r\noutside the jail, thus rendering escape as difficult at night as in\r\nbroad daylight. Water is freely supplied to every room on every storey,\r\nand means of bathing are arranged in various parts of the building.\r\nSchool-rooms, private rooms, and a chapel are all contained within this\r\nleviathan outer case. In short, to those who take an interest in\r\nimproving the airiness of jails and the security of prisoners, this\r\nbuilding is well worth the most careful examination; and I trust we may\r\nsome day profit by the improvements which the ingenuity of the New\r\nEnglanders has here exhibited, for the frequent escapes from our jails\r\nprove that some change is requisite.\r\n\r\nThe Bostonians have applied the telegraph to a most important use,\r\nwhich, I believe, we have totally overlooked in England. The town is\r\ndivided into sections, in each of which are a certain number of\r\nstations; all of these latter have a telegraph-office, communicating\r\nwith one grand central office, by which means they explain where the\r\nfire is. The central office immediately indicates to every section the\r\ninformation thus obtained by the ringing of alarm-bells; and, by this\r\nmethod, every fire-station in the city is informed of the locality of\r\nthe danger within a few minutes after its occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe naval arsenal at Boston is moderate in size, kept very clean; but\r\nwhen I visited it there were little signs of activity or life. They have\r\nonly three building sheds, in one of which a vessel has been in progress\r\nfor twenty years; the other two are vacant. The principal feature is the\r\nrope-walk, which is 1640 feet long, and worked by steam-power.\r\n\r\nThe United States, being on friendly terms with England, and so far\r\nremoved from Europe and its politics and its disturbances, pays\r\ncomparatively little attention to the navy, which is small, when\r\nconsidered in reference to the size and wealth of the country and the\r\nextent of its seaboard.\r\n\r\nThe convention for the amendment of the constitution being in session, I\r\nwas enabled, through the kindness of Mr. Sumner, the senator for the\r\nState, to witness their proceedings, which were conducted with becoming\r\ndignity. The speakers, if not eloquent, at least adhered to the subject\r\nunder discussion, in a manner some of the wordy and wandering gentlemen\r\nin our House of Commons might imitate with advantage.\r\n\r\nThe supply of water for the town is brought from Lake Cochitnate, a\r\ndistance of twenty miles; and the length of piping in connexion with it\r\nis upwards of 100 miles. The State authorized a city debt of 900,000l.\r\nfor the necessary expenses of the undertaking and purchase of the\r\nground, &c. The annual receipts amount to 36,000l., which will, of\r\ncourse, increase with the population. Dwelling-houses pay from 1l. as\r\nhigh as 15l. tax, according to their consumption. The average daily\r\nexpenditure in 1853 was about 7,000,000 gallons, or nearly 50 gallons\r\nper head.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Boston, I may as well give some evidence of the\r\nprosperity of the State. In the year 1830, the population was 600,000;\r\nat the present date it is 1,000,000. The exports of domestic produce,\r\nwhich in 1844 amounted to 1,275,000l., now amount to upwards of\r\n2,830,000l.; and the imports, which at the former period amounted to\r\n4,000,000l., now amount to nearly 7,000,000l. The population of\r\nBoston has increased 600 per cent. during the present century. Lowell,\r\nwhich is the great Manchester of Massachusetts, has increased its\r\npopulation from 6500 in 1830 to nearly 40,000 at the present date; and\r\nthe capital invested, which in 1823 was only 500,000l., is now nearly\r\n2,700,000l. I do not wish to weary my readers with statistics, and\r\ntherefore trust I have said enough to convey a tolerable impression of\r\nthe go-aheadism of these hardy and energetic descendants of the Pilgrim\r\nFathers; and, for the same reasons, I have not made any observations\r\nupon their valuable libraries, hospitals, houses of industry,\r\nreformation, &c., the former of which are so largely indebted to private\r\nmunificence. But before taking my leave of Boston, I must notice the\r\ngreat pleasure I derived from hearing in all quarters the favourable\r\nimpression which Lord Elgin's visit, on the occasion of opening the\r\nrailway in 1851, had produced. His eloquence and urbanity was a constant\r\ntheme of conversation with many of my friends, who generally wound up by\r\nsaying, \"A few such visits as that of the Railway Jubilee would do more\r\nto cement the good feeling between the two countries than the diplomacy\r\nof centuries could effect.\" I must here add, that upon my visiting\r\nQuebec, I found that the same cordial feeling of fellowship had been\r\nproduced on the Canadian mind, by the brotherly reception they had met\r\nwith upon that memorable occasion. Farewell to Boston! but not farewell\r\nto the pleasing recollection of the many happy hours I spent, nor of the\r\nmany kind friends whose acquaintance I enjoyed there, and which I hope\r\non same future occasion to renew and improve.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote AL: Such gifts during the lifetime of the donor, are in my\r\nestimation, better evidences of liberality and zeal in a cause, than the\r\nmost munificent bequests even of a Stephen Gerard, who only gave what he\r\ncould no longer enjoy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AM: A _Vide_ observation by Mr. H. Mann, chap. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AN: The expense of printing proper books is sometimes\r\nmentioned as an objection, on account of requiring new types for the new\r\nsounds taught. No expense can outweigh the value of a change by which\r\neducation can be facilitated; but even this difficulty has been obviated\r\nby Major Beniowski's plan. He obtains the new symbols requisite by\r\nsimply inverting a certain number of letters for that purpose.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n_Canada_.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly morning found me seated in the cars on my way to Quebec. Not being\r\na good hand at description of scenery, this railway travelling is a\r\ngreat boon to my unfortunate reader--if he have got thus far. A Nubian\r\nclothed in castor-oil, and descending from the heavens by a slippery\r\nseat upon a rainbow, might as well attempt to describe the beauties of\r\nour sphere as the caged traveller at the tail of the boiling kettle\r\nattempt to convey much idea of the scenery he passes through. Not merely\r\ndo the scrunching squeaks of the break, the blasty trumpet whistle, the\r\nslamming of doors, and the squalling of children bewilder his brain and\r\nbedeafen his ears, but the iron tyrant enchains and confuses his eyes. A\r\nbeautiful village rivets his attention,--bang he goes into the tunneled\r\nbowels of the earth; a magnificent panorama enchants his sight as he\r\nemerges from the realms of darkness; he calls to a neighbour to share\r\nthe enjoyment of the lovely scene with him; the last sounds of the call\r\nhave not died away, ere he finds himself wedged in between two\r\nembankments, with nought else but the sky for the eye to rest on. Is it\r\nany wonder, then--nay, rather, is it not an evidence of\r\ntruthfulness--that I find the record of my journey thus described in my\r\nnote-book:--\"7-1/2 A.M., Fizz, fizz; hiss, hiss--waving\r\nfields--undulating ground--sky--varied tints of green--cottages, cattle,\r\nhumanities--bridges, bays, rivers, dust, and heat--Rouse's Point, 7-1/2\r\nP.M.\" At this point we got out of the cage and embarked in a steamer.\r\nThe shroud of night hung heavily around us, and the lights of Montreal\r\nand its suburbs, reflected in the unruffled stream, shone all the\r\nbrighter from the density of the surrounding darkness, and formed a\r\nbrilliant illumination. In half an hour I was comfortably housed in the\r\nhotel, where, to my agreeable surprise, I met one of my countrywomen,\r\nwhose many charms had made her a theme of much admiration at Washington,\r\nwhere I first had the pleasure of making her acquaintance.\r\n\r\nAny one who, wandering far from home, finds himself surrounded with\r\nutter strangers, will partially understand the pleasure I enjoyed at\r\nfinding one face I had looked upon before; but to understand it fully,\r\nthey must know the face I was then gazing upon. Don't be curious,\r\nreader, as to whom it belonged, for I have no intention of enlightening\r\nyou, further than to say it belonged to her and her husband. Twelve\r\nhours of railway makes me sleepy; it's my nature, and I can't help it,\r\nso I trust I may be excused, when I confess that I very soon exchanged\r\nthe smile of beauty for the snore of Morpheus. What my dreams were, it\r\nconcerns nobody to know.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent brow of hill which overhangs Montreal was named in 1535\r\nMont Royal, by the famous Jacques Cartier, in honour of his royal\r\nmaster; the French settlement which arose a century after, in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Indian village of Hochelaga, assumed the name of\r\nthe hill, and has at last shaken down into its present combination. What\r\nGoths, not to preserve the Indian name which savours of the land and of\r\nantiquity, instead of substituting a French concoction! With regard to\r\nthe site of the town, there is no doubt it is on the island now called\r\nMontreal; but where that island is situated may be considered an open\r\nquestion; the river Ottawa runs into the St. Lawrence at the western\r\nextremity of the island, and the question is, whether the water on the\r\nnorthern shore is the Ottawa or the St. Lawrence; upon which depends\r\nwhether the island is in the St. Lawrence, or between the St. Lawrence\r\nand the Ottawa. Not wishing to deprive either of their finger in the\r\npie, I should give my verdict in favour of the latter opinion; but I\r\nleave it an open question to the reader. The population of the town is\r\nincreasing rapidly, no doubt owing in great measure to emigration. In\r\n1849 it was 48,000, in 1851, 58,000. The great majority are of the\r\nChurch of Rome, 41,000; of the Church of England there are 4000; the\r\nother denominations are in small numbers.\r\n\r\nAt the time I arrived, the town was full of gloom and excitement, for\r\nit was but a few days previous that the Roman Catholics endeavoured to\r\nmurder Gavazzi, while delivering one of his anti-Romanistic lectures,\r\nwhich, whatever their merits or demerits, were most certainly very\r\ninjudicious, considering the elements of which the population of\r\nMontreal is composed; and it cannot be denied, that Signor Gavazzi's\r\nlectures upon sacred subjects are delivered in a style partaking so much\r\nof the theatrical, that a person ignorant of the language of his\r\naddress, might readily suppose that he was taking off John Kemble and\r\nListon alternately, and therefore the uneducated Irish emigrants might\r\nvery well conclude his sole object was to turn their creed into\r\nridicule. I certainly never heard or saw a person, lecturing on sacred\r\nsubjects, whose tone and manner were so ridiculously yet painfully at\r\nvariance with the solemnity due to such a theme. The excitement\r\nproduced, the constant calling out of the military, and the melancholy\r\nsequel, are too recent and well known to require recapitulation here. It\r\nis but just to the French Romanists to state, that as a body they\r\nrepudiated and took no part in the villanous attempt upon Gavazzi's\r\nlife; the assailants were almost exclusively Irish Romanists, who form\r\nnearly one-fifth of the population. Would that they could leaven their\r\nfaith with those Christian virtues of peacefulness and moderation which\r\nshine so creditably in their co-religionists of French origin.\r\n\r\nWhile touching upon the subject of the military being called out in aid\r\nof the civil power, I am reminded of a passage extracted from some\r\njournal which a friend showed me, and which I consider so well\r\nexpressed, that I make no apology for giving it at length.\r\n\r\n  \"THE MOB.--The mob is a demon fierce and ungovernable. It will not\r\n  listen to reason: it will not be influenced by fear, or pity, or\r\n  self-preservation. It has no sense of justice. Its energy is exerted\r\n  in frenzied fits; its forbearance is apathy or ignorance. It is a\r\n  grievous error to suppose that this cruel, this worthless hydra has\r\n  any political feeling. In its triumph, it breaks windows; in its\r\n  anger, it breaks heads. Gratify it, and it creates a disturbance;\r\n  disappoint it, and it grows furious; attempt to appease it, and it\r\n  becomes outrageous; meet it boldly, and it turns away. It is\r\n  accessible to no feeling but one of personal suffering; it submits to\r\n  no argument but that of the strong hand. The point of the bayonet\r\n  convinces; the edge of the sabre speaks keenly; the noise of musketry\r\n  is listened to with respect; the roar of artillery is unanswerable.\r\n  How deep, how grievous, how burdensome is the responsibility that lies\r\n  on him who would rouse this fury from its den! It is astonishing, it\r\n  is too little known, how much individual character is lost in the\r\n  aggregate character of a multitude. Men may be rational, moderate,\r\n  peaceful, loyal, and sober, as individuals; yet heap them by the\r\n  thousand, and in the very progress of congregation, loyalty,\r\n  quietness, moderation, and reason evaporate, and a multitude of\r\n  rational beings is an unreasonable and intemperate being--a wild,\r\n  infuriated monster, which may be driven, but not led, except to\r\n  mischief--which has an appetite for blood, and a savage joy in\r\n  destruction, for the mere gratification of destroying.\"\r\n\r\nThe various fires with which the city has been visited, however\r\ndistressing to the sufferers, have not been without their good effect,\r\nof which the eye has most satisfactory evidence in the numerous public\r\nand other buildings now built of stone. The only monument in the city is\r\none which was raised to Nelson. Whether the memory of the hero has\r\npassed away, or the ravages of the weather call too heavily on the\r\npublic purse, I cannot say; but it would be more creditable to the town\r\nto remove it entirely, than to allow it to remain in its present\r\ndisgraceful state. It is reported that its restoration is to be effected\r\nby private subscription; if so, more shame to the authorities.\r\n\r\nAs nay first object was to reach Quebec, I only stayed one day at\r\nMontreal, which I employed in driving about to see what changes had\r\ntaken place in the town and neighbourhood since my former visit in 1826.\r\nI started by steamer in the evening, and arrived early the next morning.\r\n\r\nIs there any scene more glorious to look upon than that which greets the\r\neye from the citadel at Quebec? The only scene I know more glorious is\r\nRio Janeiro, which I believe to be by far the grandest in the world; but\r\nthe Rio lacks the associations of Quebec. Who can ever forget that\r\nbeneath its walls two chieftains, the bravest of the brave, fell on the\r\nsame battle-field--the one in the arms of victory, the other in defence\r\nof his country and her honour? The spot where our hero fell is marked by\r\na pillar thus simply inscribed:--\r\n\r\n  HERE DIED\r\n    WOLFE,\r\n  VICTORIOUS.\r\n\r\nNor has the noble foe been forgotten, though for a long time unnoticed.\r\nIn the year 1827, the Earl of Dalhousie being Governor-General, a\r\nmonument was raised in Quebec to Wolfe and Montcalm; and the death they\r\nboth met at the post of honour is commemorated on the same column,--a\r\ncolumn on which an Englishman may gaze with pride and a Frenchman\r\nwithout a blush. The following words, forming part of the inscription, I\r\nthink well worthy of insertion: \"Military prowess gave them a common\r\ndeath, History a common fame, Posterity a common monument.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact, that when the foundation-stone was laid, an old\r\nsoldier from Ross-shire, the last living veteran of the gallant band who\r\nfought under Wolfe, was present at the ceremony, being then in his\r\nninety-fifth year. Everybody who has seen or read of Quebec must\r\nremember the magnificent towering rock overhanging the river, on the\r\nsummit of which the citadel is placed, forming at once the chief\r\nstronghold of its defence, and the grandest feature of its scenery. But\r\nperhaps everybody does not know that to this same glorious feature the\r\ncity owes its name. The puny exclamation of Jacques Cartier's Norman\r\npilot upon beholding it was, \"_Que bec_!\" and this expression of\r\nadmiration has buried, in all but total oblivion, the old Algonquin name\r\nof Stadacona. What a pity that old pilot was not born dumb.\r\n\r\nThe increase of population here does not seem, to be very rapid. In\r\n1844, it was about 36,000; now, it is little more than 42,000. There can\r\nbe no doubt that the severity of the climate is one great cause of so\r\nsmall an increase. When it is remembered that the average arrival of the\r\nfirst vessel after the breaking up of the ice is between the last week\r\nof April and the first week in May, this need not he much wondered at.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General's residence, is removed from the town, and a\r\nbeautiful little country villa, called Spencer Wood, has been assigned\r\nhim in lieu. It is situated on the banks of the river, about half a mile\r\ninland; the only objection to it is, that the size thereof is not\r\nsufficient for vice-regal entertainments; but a very slight addition\r\nwould remedy that defect. In all other respects it is a charming place,\r\nas I can gratefully testify. The drives and sights around the city are\r\ntoo well known to need much notice from me.\r\n\r\nMontmorenci, with its frozen cone in winter, is one of the chief\r\nresorts for pic-nickers in their sleighs. The trackless path over the\r\nfrozen snow during the season is as full of life as Windsor park was in\r\nthe old Ascot days. Bright eyes beaming from rosy cheeks, and half\r\nburied in furs, anxiously watch for the excitement of a capsize, and\r\nlaugh merrily as the mixed tenants of some sleigh are seen rolling over\r\none another in most ludicrous confusion; the sun shines brightly, the\r\nbells ring cheerily, all is jollity and fun, and a misanthrope would be\r\nas much out of his element in one of these pic-nics as a bear in a\r\nballet.\r\n\r\nThe falls of Lorette afford another pleasant excursion, not forgetting\r\nold Paul and his wife--a venerable Indian chief and his squaw--whom I\r\nvisited, and the cleanliness of whose cottage I had great pleasure in\r\ncomplimenting him upon, as also upon his various medals, which extended\r\nfrom Château Gai down to the Exhibition of 1851. He appeared as much\r\nstruck with my venerable appearance as I was with his; for, upon being\r\nasked my age, he bestowed a searching glance from head to foot, and then\r\ngravely replied, \"Seventy-five.\" I rebelled against his decision, and\r\nappealed to his wife, who kindly took my part, and after a steady gaze,\r\nsaid, \"Oh, Paul! that gentleman is not more than seventy-two.\" It was in\r\nvain I tried to satisfy them, that thirty summers would have to pass\r\nover my head before I reached that honourable time of life. However, it\r\nis not only Indians who miscalculate age, for a young lady, fresh from\r\nIreland, having the same question put to her, said \"Sixty;\" and upon\r\nbeing told she was seventeen years out in her calculation, she replied,\r\nwith painful coolness, \"Which way?\" I never felt a confirmed old\r\nbachelor till I heard that awful \"Which way?\"\r\n\r\nThe roads round about in all directions are admirable; not so if you\r\ncross the river to the Falls of the Chaudière; but the abomination of\r\nabominations is the ferry-boat, and the facilities, or rather obstacles,\r\nfor entering and exiting. To any one who has seen the New York\r\nferry-boats, and all the conveniences connected with them, the contrast\r\nis painfully humiliating. In the one case you drive on board as readily\r\nas into a court-yard, and find plenty of room when you get there; in the\r\nother, you have half a dozen men holding horses and carriages, screaming\r\nin all directions, and more time is wasted in embarking than a Yankee\r\nboat would employ to deposit you safely on the other side; and it would\r\npuzzle a Philadelphia lawyer to decide which is the more abominable, the\r\nexit or the entry. Nevertheless, the traveller will find himself\r\ncompensated for all his troubles--especially if the horse and carriage\r\nbe a friend's--by the lovely drive which takes him to the Chaudière\r\nFalls, a trip I had the pleasure of making in company with a jolly party\r\nof good fellows belonging to the 72nd Highlanders, then in garrison at\r\nQuebec, and whose hospitalities during my stay I gratefully remember.\r\n\r\nIf, however, an Englishman feels humiliated in crossing the Quebec\r\nferry, he feels a compensating satisfaction upon entering the Quebec\r\nLegislative Council Chamber, which in its aspect of cleanliness,\r\nfurniture, &c., has an appearance of refinement far superior to that at\r\nWashington. As they were not sitting during my stay in Canada, I had no\r\nopportunity of drawing any comparison on their different modes of\r\ncarrying on public business. I had heard so much during my absence from\r\nEngland of the famous Rebellion Losses Bill, and all the obloquy which\r\nhad been heaped upon the Governor-General in consequence, that I was\r\nvery anxious to get some insight into the true state of the case,\r\nalthough perhaps the justification of the Earl of Elgin's conduct by Sir\r\nRobert Peel ought to have satisfied me.\r\n\r\nI soon became convinced that in this, as in most similar cases, the\r\nviolence of party spirit had clouded truth; and the bitterness of\r\ndefeat, in minds thus prejudiced, had sought relief in the too-common\r\nchannels of violence and abuse. However much to be deplored, I fear that\r\nthe foregoing opinions will be found, on most occasions of political\r\nexcitement, to be true. The old party, who may be said to have enjoyed\r\nthe undisguised support of the Queen's representatives from time\r\nimmemorial, were not likely to feel very well disposed to Lord Elgin,\r\nwhen they found that he was determined to identify himself with no\r\nparticular party, but that, being sent to govern Canada\r\nconstitutionally, he was resolved to follow the example of his\r\nsovereign, and give his confidence and assistance to whichever party\r\nproved, by its majority, to be the legitimate representative of the\r\nopinions of the governed, at the same time ever upholding the right and\r\ndignity of the Crown. This was, of course, a first step in unpopularity\r\nwith the party who, long triumphant, now found themselves in a minority;\r\nthen, again, it must be remembered that a majority which had for so many\r\nyears been out of power was not likely, in the excitement of victory, to\r\nexercise such moderation as would be calculated to soothe the irritated\r\nfeelings of their opponents, who, they considered, had enjoyed too long\r\nthe colonial loaves and fishes.\r\n\r\nWith all these elements at work, it is not to be wondered at that a\r\nquestion which admitted of misinterpretation should be greedily laid\r\nhold of, and that, thus misinterpreted, the passions of the mob should\r\nbe successfully roused. I believe there is little question that the\r\nGovernment brought forward the Rebellion Losses Bill in the Senate in a\r\nmanner, if not arrogant, at all events most offensive, and thus added\r\nfuel to the flames; but, viewed dispassionately, what is the truth of\r\nthis far-famed bill? It was framed upon the precedent of that for the\r\npayment of similar losses in Upper Canada on a previous occasion, and I\r\nbelieve the very same commissioners were appointed to carry out its\r\nprovisions. It received the sanction of the Governor-General in the same\r\nway as all other bills, and was never smuggled through, as the irritated\r\nopposition and infuriated mobs would have us believe. The\r\nGovernor-General clearly states that it never was intended in any way\r\n\"to compensate the losses of persons guilty of the heinous crime of\r\ntreason,\" and the names of the commissioners appointed to decide upon\r\nthe claims of the sufferers might alone have been a sufficient guarantee\r\nthat such an abominable idea was never entertained. Without mentioning\r\nothers, take Colonel W.C. Hanson: schooled in the field of honour and\r\npatriotism, whose courage has been tried in many a bloody struggle\r\nduring the Peninsular war, and is attested by the honourable badges that\r\nadorn his breast. Is a recreant rebel likely to find sympathy in that\r\nbreast which for half a century stood unchallenged for loyalty and\r\ntruth? What do his letters, as one of the commissioners, prove beyond\r\nthe shadow of a doubt? I have them now before me; and, so far from\r\nclaims being hastily admitted, I find the gallant old soldier constantly\r\nadvocating the cause of some claimant whom the commissioners declined to\r\nindemnify, but never yet have I seen his name as opposed to any\r\ncompensation granted; possessing that still more noble quality which is\r\never the lovely handmaid of true courage, his voice is raised again and\r\nagain for mercy.\r\n\r\nI could quote from numerous letters of this veteran, extracts similar to\r\nthe following:--The claimants were inhabitants of St. Benoit, some\r\nportion of which population had been in arms as rebels, but upon the\r\napproach of the Queen's troops they had all laid down their arms. As to\r\nthe facts of the case, Colonel Hanson writes to Lord Seaton, who\r\nreplies:--\"The soldiers were regularly put up in the village by the\r\nQuartermaster-General's department, and strict orders were issued to\r\neach officer to protect the inhabitants and their property; Lieut.-Col.\r\nTownsend to remain in the village of St. Benoit for its protection, the\r\nremainder of the troops to return to Montreal. The utmost compassion and\r\nconsideration should be felt for the families of the sufferers plunged\r\ninto affliction by the reckless conduct of their relatives; every house\r\ninjured or destroyed at St. Benoit was a wanton destruction, perpetrated\r\nin defiance of guards placed to protect property.\" Thus writes Lord\r\nSeaton. Colonel Hanson, after quoting the above, proceeds to state that\r\nthe evidence before the commissioners proves that \"immediately after\r\nLieut.-Col. Townsend assembled his regiment for the purpose of marching\r\nback to Montreal, the volunteers from the northern townships commenced\r\nplundering the village, carrying off the whole of the effects belonging\r\nto the inhabitants, burning the church, and nearly every house in the\r\nvillage ... wilfully and wantonly destroying houses, and in many\r\ninstances burning valuable barns and granaries.... Therefore I humbly\r\npretend that every such individual who thus suffered should be\r\nindemnified, as his loss was a wanton destruction of the dwellings,\r\nbuildings, property, and effects of the said inhabitants.\" Yet such was\r\nthe jealous way in which the commissioners excluded all doubtful\r\nclaimants, that Colonel Hanson found himself in a minority upon the\r\nconsideration of the foregoing claims, and, as a man of honour and\r\nanxious for justice, felt it his duty to address a letter to the\r\nGovernor-General upon the subject, from which letter, bearing date\r\nJanuary, 1852, the foregoing extracts have been taken.\r\n\r\nI have very many of such complaints of justice being withheld from\r\nclaimants, in the opinion of the gallant colonel, now lying before me,\r\nbut \"_ex uno disce omnes_.\" I have read a great portion of the Report,\r\nand the conclusion is irresistibly forced upon my mind, that everything\r\nwhich could possibly be brought to assume the slightest shade of\r\nrebellion was made fatal to an applicant's claim; but if anything were\r\nwanting to satisfy my mind that the vilifiers of the \"Losses Bill\" had\r\nnot any ground of complaint against the measure, it would be found in\r\nthe fact, that among its various opponents to whom I spoke, they one and\r\nall exclaimed, \"Look at the case of Nelson, absolutely a rebel in arms,\r\nand his claims listened to!\" This was their invariable reply; and, until\r\nI made inquiry, it looked very bad. But what was the real state of the\r\ncase? Simply that Nelson, having been ruined by his rebellion, many\r\nloyal and faithful subjects to whom he owed debts suffered for his\r\nfaults; and the money awarded for the losses sustained by the rebel went\r\nto pay the loyal debtors, except a small portion which was granted to\r\nhis wife, who was well known to be strongly opposed to the course he had\r\npursued, and who had lost considerable property which she held in her\r\nown right. I say that the fact of Nelson's case being always brought up\r\nas the great enormity carried more conviction to my mind of the utter\r\nweakness of the opponents' cause than anything else; and it also proved\r\nto me how ignorant many of them were of the truth, for several of them\r\nwho vilified the Bill, the Government, and the Governor-General, had not\r\nthe slightest idea, till I informed them, how the Nelson award was\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the atrocities of which Montreal was the scene\r\nconstitute the most discreditable features in modern Canadian history,\r\nand which, it is to be hoped, the instigators to and actors in are long\r\nsince fully ashamed of; nor can the temper and judgment of the\r\nGovernor-General on this trying occasion be too highly extolled. When it\r\nwas imperative to dissolve the Parliament, he foresaw that his not doing\r\nso in person would be misconstrued by his enemies, and that he would be\r\nbranded by them with that most galling of all accusations to a noble\r\nheart--cowardice. With a high-minded sense of duty, he put all such\r\npersonal considerations aside. There were two courses open to him: one,\r\nto call out the military, and in their safe keeping dissolve the\r\nAssembly; the other, to depute the Commander of the Forces to perform\r\nthat duty. The former must have produced a collision with the populace,\r\nand the blood of many whom he believed to be as loyal as he knew they\r\nwere misguided and excited would have flowed freely; the latter, he\r\nforesaw, would be misconstrued into an act of personal cowardice, but he\r\nknew it would prevent a flow of blood, the remembrance of which would\r\nkeep alive the bitterest elements of political animosity for years to\r\ncome. With true patriotism, he sacrificed himself at the shrine of the\r\ncountry he was sent to govern, preferring to be the subject of the most\r\ngalling accusations rather than shed unnecessarily one drop of the blood\r\nof those committed to his rule.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of Lord Elgin's able and prosperous administration, I\r\ncan scarcely conceive any one act of his to which he can look back with\r\nmore satisfaction, than this triumph of his judgment over his feelings,\r\nwhen he offered up just pride and dignity on the altar of mercy, and\r\nretired to Quebec. A shallow-pated fellow, who had probably figured\r\npersonally in the outrages of that period, in talking to me on the\r\nsubject, thus described it,--\"he bolted off in a funk to Quebec;\" and\r\ndoubtless hundreds of others, as shallow-pated as himself, had been made\r\nto believe such was the case, and vituperation being the easiest of all\r\nignoble occupations, they had probably done their best to circulate the\r\npaltry slander. Lord Elgin, however, needs no goose-quill defender; the\r\nunprecedented increasing prosperity of the colony under his\r\nadministration is the most valuable testimony he could desire. It is not\r\nevery governor who, on his arrival, finding a colony in confusion and\r\nrebellion, has the satisfaction, on his resignation of office, of\r\nleaving harmony and loyalty in their place, and the revenue during the\r\nsame period increased from 400,000l. to 1,500,000l.: and if any\r\ndoubt ever rested upon his mind as to whether his services were approved\r\nof and appreciated at home, it must have been removed in the most\r\ngratifying manner, when, upon a public dinner being given him at the\r\nLondon Tavern, 1854, all shades of politicals gathered readily to do him\r\nhonour; and while the chairman, Lord John Russell, was eulogizing his\r\ntalents and his administration, five other colonial and ex-colonial\r\nministers were present at the same board to endorse the compliment; the\r\nAmerican Minister also bearing his testimony to the happy growth of\r\ngood feeling between the two countries, which Lord Elgin had so\r\nsuccessfully fostered and developed. I cannot recal to my memory any\r\nother instance of so great an honour having been paid to a colonial\r\ngovernor.\r\n\r\nI was astonished to find so little had been done in Canada for the\r\norganization of a militia force, especially when their republican\r\nneighbours afford them an example of so much activity and efficiency in\r\nthat department. It may not be desirable as yet for the colony to\r\nestablish any military school, such as West Point; but it might be\r\nagreeable and advantageous to the colonists, if we allowed a given\r\nnumber of young men to be educated at each of our military colleges in\r\nEngland; those only being eligible, who, by a severe examination, had\r\nproved their capabilities, and whose conduct at the places of their\r\neducation had been noted as exemplary. By such simple means, a certain\r\namount of military knowledge would gradually be diffused amongst the\r\ncolonists, which would render them more efficient to repress internal\r\ntroubles or repel foreign aggression.\r\n\r\nAs it may be interesting to some of my readers, I shall here give a\r\nslight sketch of the Canadian parliaments. The Legislative Assembly, or\r\nHouse of Commons, is composed of eighty-four members, being forty-two\r\nfor each province. The qualification for membership is 500l., and the\r\nfranchise 40s. freehold, or 7l. 10s. the householder; it is also\r\ngranted to wealthy leaseholders and to farmers renting largely; the term\r\nis for four years, and members are paid 1l. per day while sitting, and\r\n6d. per mile travelling expenses. The Legislative Council consists of\r\nforty members, and is named by the Crown for life. The Cabinet, or\r\nExecutive Council, are ten in number, and selected from both Houses by\r\nthe Governor-General. Their Chancellor of the Exchequer is the Prime\r\nMinister. The Canadians wish to do away with the qualification for\r\nmembers of the Assembly, retaining the qualification for the franchise,\r\nand to increase the number of members to sixty-five for each province.\r\nThey also desire to supersede the nomination of the Crown, and to make\r\nthe Legislative Council elective,[AO] with a property qualification of\r\n1000l., thirty members for each province; these latter to be elected\r\nfor six years.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the proposed change in the Legislative Council, I confess\r\nI look upon its supposed advantages--if carried out--with considerable\r\ndoubt, inasmuch as the electors being the same as those for the other\r\nChamber, it will become merely a lower house, elected for a longer\r\nperiod, and will lose that prestige which might have been obtained by\r\nexacting a higher qualification from the electors. Then, again, I think\r\nthe period for which they are elected decidedly too short, being fully\r\nconvinced that an increase in duration will usually produce an increase\r\nin the respectability of the candidates offering themselves for\r\nelection; an opinion in which I am fully borne out by many of the wisest\r\nheads who assisted in framing the government of the United States, and\r\nwho deplored excessively the shortness of the period for which the\r\nsenators were elected.[AP] I cannot believe, either, that the removing\r\nthe power of nomination entirely from the Crown will prove beneficial to\r\nthe colony. Had the experiment been commenced with the Crown resigning\r\nthe nomination of one-half of the members, I think it would have been\r\nmore prudent, and would have helped to keep alive those feelings of\r\nassociation with, and loyalty to, the Crown which I am fully certain the\r\nmajority of the Canadians deeply feel; a phalanx of senators, removed\r\nfrom all the sinister influences of the periodical simoons common to all\r\ncountries would thus have been retained, and the Governor-General would\r\nhave had the power of calling the highest talent and patriotism to his\r\ncouncils, in those times of political excitement when the passions of\r\nelectors are too likely to be enlisted in favour of voluble agitators,\r\nwho have neither cash nor character to lose. However, as these questions\r\nare to be decided, as far as this country is concerned, by those who\r\nprobably care but little for my opinions, and as the question is not one\r\nlikely to interest the general reader, I shall not dilate further upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote AO: Since my return to England the proposed increase in the\r\nLegislative Assembly has taken place. The Imperial Government has also\r\nempowered the colony to alter the constitution of the Legislative\r\nCouncil, and to render it elective if they thought proper so to do.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AP: _Vide_ Chapter on the \"Constitution of the United\r\nStates.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n_A Trip to the Uttawa_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving spent a fortnight in the enjoyment of lovely scenery and warm\r\nhospitality, and taken a last and lingering gaze at the glorious\r\npanoramic view from the citadel, I embarked once more on the St.\r\nLawrence. It was evening; and, as the moon rose bright and clear, the\r\nwooded banks and silvered stream formed as charming a picture as the eye\r\nof man could wish to rest upon. Morning found us at Montreal. Among my\r\nfellow-passengers were two members of the Cabinet, or Executive Council,\r\nMr. Hincks and Mr. Drummond, both on their way to the Ottawa, the\r\ncommercial importance of that river to the prosperity of the colony\r\nhaving induced them to take the trip with a view of ascertaining, by\r\nactual observation and examination, what steps were most advisable to\r\nimprove its navigation.\r\n\r\nMy intention was to start at once for Kingston; but when they kindly\r\nasked me to accompany them, I joyfully accepted, and an hour after I\r\nlanded at Montreal I was on the rail with my friends, hissing away to\r\nLachine, where the chief office of the Hudson's Bay Company is fixed.\r\nThere we embarked in a steamer on Lake St. Louis, which is a struggling\r\ncompound of the dark brown Ottawa and the light blue St. Lawrence. The\r\nlake was studded with islands, and the scenery rendered peculiarly\r\nlovely by the ever-changing lights and shades from the rising sun. We\r\nsoon left the St. Lawrence compound and reached that part of the\r\nOttawa[AQ] which the poet has immortalized by his beautiful \"Canadian\r\nBoat Song.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Anne's is a small village, and the rapids being impassable in low\r\nwater they have built a lock to enable steamers to ascend; but\r\nfortunately, when we passed, there was sufficient water, and we steamed\r\nup the song-famed rapids, above which the river spreads out into the\r\nLake of the Two Mountains. It is proposed to build a railway bridge for\r\nthe main trunk line, just above the rapids. How utterly the whizzing,\r\nwhistling kettle spoils the poetry of scenery, undeniable though its\r\nutility be! There is no doubt that the Lake of the Two Mountains has\r\nmany great beauties; but, whatever they may be, a merciless storm of\r\nrain effectually curtained them from us, and we traversed the whole lake\r\nto Point Fortune in a mist worthy of the Western Highlands. There we\r\ntook coach, as the locks at Carillon are not yet large enough for\r\nfull-sized steamers to pass. The road was alike good and uninteresting,\r\nrunning by the side of the canal, whose banks were here and there\r\nenlivened by groups of wild flowers.\r\n\r\nA stage of twelve miles brought us to Grenville, where we again took\r\nsteamer on the Ottawa, and, the weather being finer, we had an\r\nopportunity of enjoying the scenery, which is very peculiar. It has none\r\nof the wild features of grandeur which one associates with comparatively\r\nunknown streams, in a country where all is gigantesque. There is nothing\r\nmountainous or craggy, but the banks and hills at the back being\r\nluxuriously wooded, and conveying the idea of being well tenanted, the\r\nabsence of human habitations seems unnatural, and gives the solitude an\r\nair of mystery, only broken at long intervals by a bowered cottage or a\r\nwreath of smoke. The most remarkable building is the French château of\r\nM. Papineau, very prettily situated on the northern bank, commanding an\r\nextensive view of the river, and looking in its isolation as though its\r\noccupant was a second Robinson Crusoe, and monarch of all he surveyed.\r\nNight soon buried all scenery in its sable mantle, and, after sixty\r\nmiles steaming, we reached Bytown, where we found friends and\r\nconveyances ready to take us over to Aylmer, there to sleep preparatory\r\nto a further excursion up the river early in the morning. As the\r\ndistance was only eight miles, we were soon at Mr. Egan's hospitable\r\nboard, from which we speedily retired to rest, so as to be ready for the\r\nmorrow's trip.\r\n\r\nEarly dawn found us on hoard and steaming merrily up the glorious\r\nstream, which, spreading out very widely, has been lakefied, and is\r\ncalled Lake Chaudière and Du Chêne, thus named, I suppose, because the\r\nwater is cold and there are few oaks to be seen. Be that as it may, the\r\nscenery, though possessing neither striking features nor variety, is\r\nvery pretty and cheerful. A quantity of lovely little villas stud the\r\nbanks, some ensconced snugly in cosy nooks, others standing out boldly\r\nupon the rich greensward; and, for a background, you have full-bosomed\r\nhills, rich in forest monarchs, clad in their dense and dark mantles.\r\nSuddenly the scene changes, the Chats Falls burst upon the sight; and\r\nwell does the magnificent view repay the traveller for any difficulty he\r\nmay have had in his endeavours to reach this spot. About three miles\r\nabove the rocky and well-wooded island that creates the falls, the river\r\ncontracts very considerably, and in its rushing impetuosity seems as\r\nthough it were determined to sweep the whole island into the lake below;\r\nthen there appears to have been a compromise between the indignant\r\nstream and the obstinate island, and the latter seems to have offered up\r\na great portion of its timber at the shrine of Peace, and to have\r\nfurther granted various rights of way to its excited neighbour. The\r\nriver seems to have taken advantage of both these concessions very\r\nlargely, but it appears that in nature, as it often occurs in politics,\r\nconcessions only breed increased demands, and the ungrateful Ottawa,\r\nwhile sweeping away forest timber and baring the granite rock in a dozen\r\ndifferent channels, thunders its foaming waters along with an angry\r\nvoice, ever crying \"More, more.\"\r\n\r\nI never saw anything more beautiful than these falls. They are generally\r\nfrom twenty to forty feet broad, and about the same in height; but from\r\nthe shape of the island you cannot see them all at once; and as you\r\nsteam along there is a continual succession of them, each revealing some\r\nnew beauty. It was at this place that I, for the first time, saw a slide\r\nfor the descent of lumber, to which I shall have to refer hereafter. For\r\nmany years the porterage of goods across this island to the Ottawa\r\nabove--which is called Lake Chats--was a work of much difficulty and\r\nexpense. Mr. E., with that enterprise and energy which mark his\r\ncharacter, got two friends of kindred spirit to join him, and made a\r\nrailway across, about three miles and a half long. It is a single line,\r\nconstructed upon piles, and the car is rattled over at a jolly pace by\r\ntwo spicy ponies. As the piles are in some places from twenty to thirty\r\nfeet in the air, it looks nervous work; and if one of the ponies bolted,\r\nit might produce a serious accident; but they seem aware of the danger,\r\nand trot away as steadily as an engine, if not quite so rapidly.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the north-western end of the island, another steamer was\r\nwaiting for us, and we again breasted the stream of the Ottawa. After\r\npassing the first three miles, which, as before mentioned, are very\r\nnarrow, and thus produce that additional impetus which ends in the\r\nlovely Chats Falls, the river opens out into the Lake. The shores are\r\nlow and with a gentle rise, and there is comparatively little appearance\r\nof agricultural activity, the settler having found the ground at the\r\nback of the rise better suited for farming purposes.\r\n\r\nSome distance up the lake, and close to its margin, is the farm of Mr.\r\nMcDonnell, thus forming an exception to the general rule. His residence\r\nis an excessively pretty cottage, commanding a grand panoramic view.\r\nHere we stopped to pay a visit to the energetic old Highlander and his\r\nfamily, and to enjoy his hospitalities. If he is to be taken as a\r\nspecimen of the salubrity of the climate, I never saw so healthy a\r\nplace. He came here as a lad to push his fortunes, with nothing but a\r\ngood axe and a stout heart. He has left fifty summers far behind him; he\r\nlooks the embodiment of health, and he carries his six feet two inches\r\nin a way that might well excite the envy of a model drill-sergeant; and\r\nwhen he took my hand to welcome me, I felt all my little bones\r\nscrunching under his iron grasp, as if they were so many bits of pith.\r\n\r\nI could not help contrasting the heartiness of his welcome with the two\r\nstiff fingers which in highly-civilized life are so often proffered\r\neither from pride or indifference; and though he did very nearly make me\r\ncry \"Enough!\" I would a thousand times rather suffer and enjoy his\r\nhearty grasp than the cold formality of conventional humbug. The hardy\r\nold pioneer has realized a very comfortable independence, and he told me\r\nhis only neighbours were a band of his countrymen at the back of the\r\nhill, who speak Gaelic exclusively and scarce know a word of English.\r\nThey mostly came out with \"The Macnab,\" but from time to time they are\r\nrefreshed by arrivals from the Old Country.\r\n\r\nHaving a long day's work before us, we were enabled to make but a short\r\nstay, so, bidding him and his family a sincere good-bye and good speed,\r\nwe renewed our journey. We soon came in sight of the black stumpy\r\nmonuments of one of the most disastrous conflagrations which ever\r\nvictimized a forest. Some idea may be formed of the ravages of the\r\n\"devouring element,\" from the simple fact that it all but totally\r\nconsumed every stick of timber covering a space of forty-five miles by\r\ntwenty-five; and the value of what was thus destroyed may be partially\r\nestimated, when it is considered that one good raft of timber is worth\r\nfrom three to five thousand pounds. These rafts, which are seen dotted\r\nabout the lake in every direction, have a very pretty effect, with their\r\nlittle distinguishing flags floating in the breeze, some from the top of\r\na pole, some from the top of the little shanty in which their hardy\r\nnavigators live; and a dreary, fatiguing, and dangerous career it must\r\nbe; but Providence, in his mercy, has so constituted man, that habit\r\ngrows into a new nature; and these hardy sons of creation sing as\r\nmerrily, smile as cheerfully, smoke as calmly, and unquestionably sleep\r\nas soundly, as any veteran in idleness, though pampered with luxuries,\r\nand with a balance at his banker's which he is at a loss how to\r\nsquander.\r\n\r\nThese sons of toil bear practical testimony to the truth of what the\r\nlate lamented Sir J. Franklin always declared to be his conviction, from\r\nlong experience, viz., that the use of spirits is enfeebling rather than\r\ninvigorating to those who have to work in the most severe climates. The\r\nLumberers are nearly all teetotallers, and I am told they declare that\r\nthey find their health bettered, their endurance strengthened, their\r\nmuscles hardened, and their spirits enlivened by the change. If this be\r\nso, and if we find that the natives of warm climates are, as a mass,\r\nalso teetotallers, and that when they forsake their temperance colours\r\nthey deteriorate and eventually disappear, I fear we must come to the\r\nconclusion, that however delicious iced champagne or sherry-cobbler may\r\nbe, or however enjoyable \"a long pull at the pewter-pot,\" they are not\r\nin any way necessary to health or cheerfulness, and that, like all\r\nactions, they have their reactions, and thus create a desire for their\r\nrepetition, until by habit they become a second nature, to the great\r\ncomfort and consolation of worthy wine-merchants and fashionable medical\r\nmen, whose balance-sheets would suffer about equally by the\r\ndiscontinuance of their use; not to mention the sad effects of their\r\nmisuse, as daily exhibited in police reports and other features, if\r\npossible worse, which the records of \"hells\" would reveal.\r\n\r\nSo strong does the passion become, that I know of a lady who weighs\r\nnearly a ton, and is proud of displaying more of her precious substance\r\nthan society generally approves of, in whom the taste \"for a wee drop\"\r\nis so strong, that, to enable her to gratify it more freely, she has the\r\npleasure of paying two medical men a guinea each daily, to stave off as\r\nlong as they can its insidious attacks upon her gigantic frame. You must\r\nnot, however, suppose that I am a teetotaller. I have tried it, and\r\nnever found myself better than while practising it; still I never lose a\r\nchance if a bottle of iced champagne is circulating, for I confess--I\r\nlove it dearly.\r\n\r\nPardon this digression.--We are again on the Ottawa; as we advance, the\r\nriver narrows and becomes studded with little islands covered with wild\r\nshrubs and forest trees, from whose stiff unyielding boughs the more\r\npliant shoots droop playfully into the foaming stream below, like the\r\nchildren of Gravity coquetting with the family of Passion. Of course\r\nthese islands form rapids in every direction: we soon, approach the one\r\nselected as the channel in which to try our strength. On we dash\r\nboldly--down rushes the stream with a roar of defiance; arrived midway,\r\na deadly struggle ensues between boiling water and running water; we\r\ntremble in the balance of victory--the rushing waters triumph; we sound\r\na retreat, which is put in practice with the caution of a Xenophon, and\r\ndown we glide into the stiller waters below.\r\n\r\nPoke the fires,--pile the coals! Again we dash onwards--again we reach\r\nmidway--again the moment of struggle--again the ignominy of\r\ndefeat--again the council of war in the stiller waters below. We now\r\nsummon all our energies, determined that defeat shall but nerve us to\r\ngreater exertion. We go lower down, so as to obtain greater initial\r\nvelocity; the fires are made to glow one spotless mass of living heat.\r\nAgain the charge is sounded: on we rush, our little boat throbbing from\r\nstem to stern; again the angry waters roar defiance--again the deadly\r\nstruggle--again for a moment we tremble in the balance of victory.\r\nSuddenly a universal shout of triumph is heard, and as the joyous cheers\r\ndie in echoes through the forest, we are breasting the smoother waters\r\nof the Ottawa above the rapids.\r\n\r\nThis is all very well on paper, but I assure you it was a time of\r\nintense excitement to us; if in the moment of deadly struggle the tiller\r\nropes had broken, or the helmsman had made one false turn of the wheel,\r\nwe might have got across the boiling rapids, and then good-bye to\r\nsublunary friends; our bones might have been floating past Quebec before\r\nthe news of our destruction had reached it.\r\n\r\nThe Ottawa is by no means the only channel in these parts for conveying\r\nthe produce of the lumberer's toil: there are tributaries innumerable,\r\naffording hundreds of miles of raft navigation; so that an almost\r\nindefinite field for their labour is open, and years, if not centuries,\r\nmust elapse before the population can increase sufficiently to effect\r\nany very material inroad on these all but inexhaustible forests.\r\n\r\nAfter proceeding a few miles beyond the scene of our late severe\r\nstruggle, we reached the little village of Portage du Fort, above which\r\nthe rapids are perfectly impassable. The inhabitants of this little wild\r\nforest community are not very numerous, as may be supposed, and the only\r\nobject of interest is a flour-mill, which supplies the lumberers for\r\nmany miles, both above and below. Our little steamer being unable to\r\nascend higher, we were compelled to make a Scotchman's cruise of\r\nit--\"There and bock agin.\" So, turning our head eastward, we bowled\r\nalong merrily with the stream, dashing down our late antagonist like a\r\nflash of lightning, then across the lake, and through a fleet of\r\nbannered rafts, till we landed on the Chats Falls Island, where we found\r\nour ponies ready to whisk us along the mid-air railway. Re-embarking on\r\nthe steamer of the morning, we found a capital dinner ready for us, and\r\nere the shades of evening had closed in, we were once more enjoying the\r\nhospitalities of Aylmer.\r\n\r\nAylmer has only a population of 1100 inhabitants, but they are not idle.\r\nThe house of Mr. E. does business with the lumberers to the tune of\r\n200,000l. annually, and supplies them with 15,000 lb. of tea every\r\nyear. Grog-shops are at a discount in these parts. The increasing\r\nprosperity of this neighbourhood is mainly owing to the energy and\r\nenterprise of Mr. Egan and his friend M. Aumond. It was by these two\r\ngentlemen that the steam-boats were put on the lakes, and the rail made\r\nacross the island. Everybody feels how much the facility of conveyance\r\nhas increased the prosperity of this locality; and the value of Mr. E.'s\r\nservices is honourably recognised, by his unopposed election as the\r\nrepresentative of the district. Having had a good night's rest, and\r\ntaken in a substantial breakfast, we started off on our return to\r\nBytown, which city may he considered as the headquarters of the\r\nlumberers.\r\n\r\nThe ground upon which the greater part of Bytown stands was offered some\r\nyears since to a servant, as payment for a debt of 70l.; he found the\r\nbargain so bad, that he tried to get out of it. The value of the same\r\nland is now estimated at 200,000l.!!! As late as 1826, there was not\r\none stone put upon another; now the population is 10,000, and steadily\r\nincreasing. Nothing can exceed the beauty of the panoramic view from the\r\nverge of the Barrack Hill, which is a dark, frowning, perpendicular rock\r\nseveral hundred feet high. To the west are the Chaudière Falls, 200 feet\r\nbroad and 60 feet high, irregular in shape, and broken here and there by\r\nrocks, around which the rapids leap in unceasing frenzy, ere they take\r\ntheir last plunge into the maddened gulf below, thence rolling their\r\ndark waters beneath your feet. Below the falls the river is spanned by a\r\nvery light and beautiful suspension-bridge. This part of the scene is\r\nenlivened by the continual descent of timber-rafts rushing down the\r\nslides, skilfully guided by their hardy and experienced navigators.\r\nAround you is a splendid expanse of waving field and sombre forest, far\r\nas the eye can stretch, and bounded towards the north by mountains\r\nlooming and half lost in distance, whence comes the mighty Gatineau--a\r\nwatery highway for forest treasure, threading its course like a stream\r\nof liquid silver as the sun's rays dance upon its bosom,--the whole\r\nforming one of the most beautiful panoramas imaginable.\r\n\r\nNo place was ever better calculated for the capital of a great country.\r\nBordering upon Upper and Lower Canada, only twelve hours from Montreal,\r\neasily capable of defence, with a trade increasing in value as rapidly\r\nas the source thereof is inexhaustible, at the confluence of two rivers\r\nwhose banks are alike rich in timber and arable land--requiring but\r\nnineteen miles of lockage to unite the St. Lawrence, the Ottawa, and the\r\nGatineau with the boundless inland lakes of America--possessing the\r\nmagnificent Rideau Canal, which affords a ready transport down to\r\nKingston on Lake Ontario--rich with scenery, unsurpassed in beauty and\r\ngrandeur, and enjoying a climate as healthy as any the world can\r\nproduce,--Nature seems to have marked out Bytown as the site for a\r\nCanadian metropolis. In short, were I a prophet instead of a traveller,\r\nI should boldly predict that such it must be some day, if Canada remain\r\nunited and independent.\r\n\r\nI must here explain the slides for lumber, before alluded to. In days\r\ngone by, all lumber was shot down the rapids, to find its way as best it\r\ncould, the natural consequence being that large quantities were\r\nirrecoverably lost. It occurred to Mr. Wright that this waste of toil\r\nand timber might be obviated, and he accordingly, after great labour and\r\nexpense, succeeded in inventing what is termed a slide--in other words,\r\nan inclined wooden frame--upon which a certain number of the huge logs\r\nthat compose a portion of a raft can be floated down together in perfect\r\nsecurity, under the guidance of one or two expert men. The invention\r\nanswered admirably, as is proved by the fact that, through its\r\ninstrumentality, timber which formerly took two seasons to reach Quebec,\r\nnow does so in five months. Like many other inventors, I fear Mr. Wright\r\nhas not received justice at the hands of the Government, who, by\r\nbuilding slides of their own, and granting advantages to those who use\r\nthem, have thus removed the traffic from Mr. Wright's--an injustice\r\nwhich it is to be hoped it is not too late to repair; at all events, the\r\nImperial Legislature, which felt bound to vote 4000l. to a man that\r\ninvented a machine for making little holes between penny stamps, on the\r\nground of commercial utility, must agree with me that it is unworthy of\r\na lumbering colony to neglect the claims of a man whose invention has\r\nproved to be a benefit to the lumber trade, absolutely beyond\r\ncalculation.\r\n\r\nThe chief proprietor at Bytown is the Hon. Mr. Mackay, and of his career\r\nin Canada he may indeed be justly proud. Arriving in the country as a\r\nlabourer without a friend, he has, by his integrity and intellectual\r\ncapability, fought his way up nobly to the highest position in the\r\ncolony, and is one of the most respected members of the Legislative\r\nCouncil. Nor has he, while battling for senatorial honours, neglected\r\nhis more material interests, and the energy he has brought to bear upon\r\nthem has been rewarded to his heart's desire. He has a charming little\r\ncountry place, called Rideau Hall, about three miles out of town, and is\r\nthe owner of several carding, saw, and flour mills, besides an\r\nextensive cloth factory, from the produce of which I am at this moment\r\nmost comfortably clad. Mr. Mackay's career may fairly be termed a useful\r\ncolonial monument, to encourage the aspirations of noble ambition, and\r\nto scourge the consciences of those drones who always see \"a lion in the\r\nway.\" We had the pleasure of enjoying his hospitalities at a grand\r\nbreakfast which he gave in honour of my two travelling friends, who\r\nwere, I believe, the first members of the Executive Council that had\r\nbeen here for very many years.\r\n\r\nOne object of their present visit was to ascertain, from personal\r\nobservation and inquiry, how far it was desirable the Government should\r\ngrant money for the purpose of making any of the locks requisite to\r\nconnect the Ottawa, &c., with Montreal and Quebec. I cannot for an\r\ninstant doubt their being most thoroughly convinced both of its perfect\r\npracticability and of its immense importance. It only requires the\r\nconstruction of nineteen miles of canal, to complete an unbroken water\r\ncommunication from Quebec to the Ottawa and all its gigantic\r\ntributaries, extending even to Lake Temiscaming; and if a canal were cut\r\nfrom this latter to Lake Nipissing, the communication would then be\r\ncomplete through the heart of Canada across all the inland ocean waters\r\nof the American continent, and thence to New York _viâ_ Erie Canal and\r\nHudson, or to New Orleans _viâ_ Illinois Canal, River, and Mississippi.\r\nAlready 50,000l. have been, voted for this purpose, and this first\r\ninstalment is mainly due to the energy of Mr. Egan. As a mark of respect\r\nfor their representative, he was to be honoured with a public dinner, at\r\nwhich my two companions of the Executive Council were to attend.\r\nUnfortunately, my time was limited, and I was obliged to decline\r\nparticipating in the compliment which Mr. Egan had so well earned; so,\r\nbidding adieu to my friends, and casting one last and lingering glance\r\nat that glorious panorama--the remembrance of which time can never\r\nefface, I got into an open shay, and began prosecuting my solitary way\r\ntowards Prescott.\r\n\r\nI left the hotel as the guests were all arriving, and the fumes of the\r\ncoming feast proclaiming in the most appetizing way the object of their\r\nmeeting. I had two hours' daylight still left, and thus was enabled to\r\nsee a little of that part of the neighbourhood, which alone was\r\nconcealed when standing on the Barrack-hill. The more I saw of it, the\r\nmore convinced was I of the peculiar adaptation of Bytown for a great\r\ncity; the ground is admirably suited for building, and possesses a\r\nwater-power which is inexhaustible. My road, as may naturally be\r\nsupposed in a new country, lay through alternations of forest and\r\ncultivation; if it was not well macadamized, at least it was far better\r\nthan I had expected, and there is some pleasure in being agreeably\r\ndisappointed, and able to jog along without eternally bumping in some\r\ndeep rut, which shakes the ash off your cigar inside your waistcoat.\r\nHere and there, of course, I came across a break-neck tract, but that\r\nonly made the contrast more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nAt half-past twelve at night the little horses began to feel the effects\r\nof six hours' work, so I stopped at a tolerably miserable wayside inn\r\nfor four hours, which was distributed between washing, feeding, and\r\nsleeping. Sharp work, but I was anxious to catch the steamer; so,\r\nsnatching what rest I could out of that brief period, and hoping the\r\nhorses had done the same, I was again _en route_ at 5 A.M., and by great\r\nexertions reached Prescott in good time to learn that the steamer had\r\nstarted half an hour before my arrival. I consoled myself, as well as I\r\ncould, with a washing basin, a teapot, and auxiliaries. I then went to\r\nlook at the town, which consists of about three streets, and 3000\r\ninhabitants; so that operation was accomplished without trouble,\r\ninterest, or much loss of time. Ascertaining that if I went over to\r\nOgdensburg, I could catch a steamer at 2 P.M., I ferried across\r\ninstanter, wishing to get a look at Brother Jonathan's town before\r\nstarting. A comparison between the two was not flattering to my national\r\nvanity. Instead of finding a population of 3000, with no indication of\r\nprogress, I found a population of 8000, with go-aheadism in all\r\nquarters; large houses, large streets, and active prosperity stamped on\r\neverything. Doubtless this disparity is greatly owing to the railway, by\r\nwhich the latter is connected with the whole State of New York, and also\r\nfrom the want of reciprocity. Nevertheless, there is a stamp of energy\r\nat Ogdensburg, which the most careless observer cannot but see is\r\nwanting at Prescott.\r\n\r\nMr. Parish is the great proprietor at the former of these towns, and is\r\nsaid to be a man of considerable wealth, which he appears to be\r\nemploying alike usefully and profitably--viz., in reclaiming from the\r\nlake a piece of land, about four hundred square yards, adjoining the\r\nrailway terminus, by which means vessels will be able to unload readily\r\non his new wharf; the reclaimed ground will thereby acquire an enormous\r\nvalue for storehouses.\r\n\r\nHaving finished my observations, and been well baked by a vertical\r\nsun, I embarked at 2 P.M. Lovely weather and lovely scenery.\r\n\r\nThe village of Brockville is very prettily situated on the banks of the\r\nlake, and is considered one of the prettiest towns in Canada. Continuing\r\nour course, numberless neat little villages and lovely villas appear\r\nfrom time to time; but when fairly on the Lake of The Thousand Isles,\r\nthe scenery is altogether charming, and some new beauty is constantly\r\nbursting into view. Upon the present occasion the scene was rendered\r\nmore striking by the perfect reflection of all the islands upon the\r\nburnished bosom of the glassy lake. We reached Cape Vincent towards\r\nevening, and, changing into another steamer, landed safely at Kingston\r\nabout ten at night, where, finding a young artillery friend, I was soon\r\nimmersed in that most absorbing of all pleasures to one long from\r\nhome--viz., talking over old friends and old scenes, until you feel as\r\nthough you were among both of them. Night, however, has its claims upon\r\nman, and, being honest, I discharged my obligation by going to bed as\r\nthe tell-tale clock struck three.\r\n\r\nKingston is but a small place, though once of considerable importance.\r\nThe population is about 12,000. In the year 1841, Lord Sydenham having\r\nremoved the seat of Government from Toronto to Kingston, the inhabitants\r\nexpended large sums of money in the expectation that it would so\r\ncontinue; but, in 1844, it was removed back again, and consequently a\r\nvery heavy loss was incurred by those who had laid out their money. It\r\nis this eternal shifting about of the seat of Government--the\r\ndisadvantage of which must be manifest to every one--that makes me hope\r\nBytown, the position of which is so central, may some day be decided\r\nupon as the city to enjoy that honour permanently. However much Kingston\r\nmay be recovering itself, and I was told it is, I must confess that,\r\ndespite its cathedral, colleges, university, and other fine buildings,\r\nwhich it undoubtedly possesses, the grass in the streets and lanes, the\r\npigs and the cows feeding about in all directions, made me feel ashamed,\r\nespecially when I thought of young Ogdensburg, which I had so lately\r\nleft. Taking into consideration the extent of lake communication which\r\nit enjoys, and that by the magnificent Rideau Canal the whole country of\r\nthe Ottawa is open to it, I must say that I consider the state of\r\nKingston the strongest reflection upon the energy and enterprise of the\r\npopulation. The finest view is from the citadel, which commands a\r\nsplendid panoramic expanse; the fortifications are in good repair, and\r\ngarrisoned by Canadian Rifles and a few Royal Artillerymen. One of the\r\nobjects I should have had most interest in visiting was the Provincial\r\nPenitentiary, the arrangements of which, I had heard, were admirable;\r\nbut, as I had no time to see them, the reader is saved the details.\r\n\r\nAt 3 P.M., I was again steaming away on Lake Ontario, which soon spreads\r\nout into an open sea. The boat was tolerably good and clean, and the\r\nfood to match, but it was served down below; the cabin was therefore\r\nvery stuffy. I selected a bed with great care, and in due time got into\r\nit, quite delighted with my carefully-chosen position, and soon buried\r\nmy nose in the pillow, full of peaceful hopes. Luckless mortal! scarce\r\nhad my nose extracted the cold from its contact with the pillow-case,\r\nwhen a sound came rushing forth with a violence which shook not only me\r\nand my bed, but the whole cabin. The tale is soon told. I had built my\r\nnest at the muzzle of the whistle of the engine, and, as they made a\r\npoint of screeching forth the moment anything appeared in sight, you may\r\nguess that I had a pleasant night of it, and have scrupulously avoided\r\nrepeating the experiment in any subsequent steam excursions. Having\r\nnobody to blame but myself, I lost the little satisfaction I might have\r\nhad in abusing somebody else, and calling him a stupid ass for making\r\nsuch a choice. However, as a matter of justice, I abused myself, and the\r\npoint being beyond dispute, no rejoinder was put in. Pleased with the\r\ncandour of my confession, I caught such snatches of rest as the engineer\r\nand his whistle in mercy vouchsafed me--the next morning we were in\r\nToronto.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The Bytown mentioned in the foregoing chapter is now called\r\nOttawa, and is a candidate, in conjunction with Montreal and Toronto,\r\nfor the honour of permanent metropolitanism.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote AQ: Originally Uttàwa, wherein Moore has shown alike his good\r\ntaste and respect for antiquity by adhering to the original and more\r\nbeautiful name.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n_Colonial Education and Prosperity_.\r\n\r\n\r\nToronto is prettily situated, and looks flourishing and prosperous; the\r\nway in which property is increasing in value here is wonderful, and the\r\nhits some people have made are quite fabulous. A property which had been\r\nbought for 30,000l., was, within a month--before even the price was\r\npaid in full--resold in lots for 100,000l. The position of the town is\r\nadmirably adapted for a great commercial city: it possesses a secure\r\nharbour; it is situated on a lake about 190 miles long by 50 broad;\r\nthence the St. Lawrence carries its produce to the ocean, and the Rideau\r\nCanal connects it with the lumberers' home on the Ottawa; the main trunk\r\nline of railway, which will extend from the western point of the colony\r\nto Halifax, passes through it; a local line, traversing some of the\r\nrichest land in Canada, is now in progress to Lake Simcoe and Lake\r\nHuron; one iron horse already affords it communication with\r\nWaterloo--nearly opposite Buffalo--whence produce descends by the Erie\r\nCanal and the Hudson to New York: besides all which advantages, it\r\nenjoys at present the privilege of being one of the seats of government\r\nand the radiating point of education. Surely, then, if any town in Upper\r\nCanada ought to flourish, it is Toronto; nor is there, I trust, any\r\nreason to doubt that it will become a most wealthy and important place.\r\nThe influence of the young railways is already beginning to be felt: the\r\npopulation, which in 1851 was only 25,000, amounted in 1853 to upwards\r\nof 30,000, and is still rapidly increasing. Having been fortunate enough\r\nto make the acquaintance of Mr. Cumberland, the chief engineer of the\r\nline of railway to Lake Simcoe, he was kind enough to ask me to\r\naccompany him to that lake on a trip of inspection, an offer of which I\r\ngladly availed myself. I was delighted to find that the Canadians had\r\nsufficient good sense to patronize first and second class carriages;\r\nand, also, that they have begun to make their own carriages and\r\nlocomotives. The rails appeared very solidly laid down, and the road\r\nfenced off; but, despite the fences, an inquisitive cow managed to get\r\non the line, and was very near being made beef of in consequence. The\r\nprogress of cultivation gave the most satisfactory evidence of\r\nincreasing prosperity, while the virgin forest-land told what a rich\r\nharvest was still in store for the industrious emigrant.\r\n\r\nEver and anon you saw on the cleared ground that feature so peculiar to\r\nAmerican scenery, a patriarchal remnant of the once dense forest, as\r\ndestitute of branches as the early Adam was of small-clothes, his bark\r\nsabled by the flames, the few summit leaves--which alone indicated\r\nvitality--scarce more in number than the centuries he could boast, and\r\ntrembling, as it were, at their perilous weight and doubtful tenure,\r\nwhile around him stood stumps more sabled, on whom the flames had done\r\nmore deadly work, the whole--when the poetry had passed away--reminding\r\none of a black Paterfamilias standing proudly in the centre of his\r\nnigger brood.\r\n\r\nThere is a good iron-foundry established here, which turns out some\r\nexcellent engines. Some of the public buildings are also fine; but,\r\nthere being unfortunately no quarries in the neighbourhood, they are\r\nbuilt of brick. The Lunatic Asylum is one of the best; but it is\r\nsurrounded with a high prison-looking wall, which I believe modern\r\nexperience condemns strongly as exercising a baneful influence upon the\r\nunfortunate patients. If it be so, let us hope it may be enclosed by\r\nsomething more light, airy, and open.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the churches are very fine. I visited the Episcopal Church,\r\nwhich has been burnt down three times; and on my remarking to the\r\narchitect the apparent clumsiness of the pews, which destroyed the\r\neffect inside, he smiled, and told me that by the contract he was\r\nobliged to replace them exactly as before. I told him I thought it was a\r\nspecimen of conservatism run mad, to which he fully assented. Trinity\r\nEpiscopal College is one of the finest edifices in the neighbourhood; at\r\npresent it contains only thirty-five students, but it is to be hoped its\r\nsphere of usefulness may be extended as its funds increase. It has the\r\nfoundation of a very good library, which is rapidly extending; the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge sent them out a magnificent addition of 3000\r\nvolumes. The last building I shall mention is the Normal School, to\r\nvisit which was one of my chief objects in stopping at Toronto.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NORMAL SCHOOL, TORONTO]\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of laying the foundation-stone of this building was\r\ninaugurated with all due solemnity, and under the auspices of the able\r\nrepresentative of our gracious Queen, on the 2nd of July, 1851. In his\r\neloquent speech on that memorable occasion, when referring to the\r\ndifficulties on the question of religious instruction, the following\r\nbeautiful passage occurs:--\r\n\r\n  \"I understand, sir, that while the varying views and opinions of a\r\n  mixed religious society are scrupulously respected, while every\r\n  semblance of dictation is carefully avoided, it is desired, it is\r\n  earnestly recommended, it is confidently expected and hoped, that\r\n  every child who attends our common schools shall learn there that he\r\n  is a being who has an interest in eternity as well as in time; that he\r\n  has a Father towards whom he stands in a closer and more affecting and\r\n  more endearing relationship than to any earthly father, and that\r\n  Father is in heaven; that he has a hope far transcending every earthly\r\n  hope--a hope full of immortality--the hope, namely, that that Father's\r\n  kingdom may come; that he has a duty which, like the sun in our\r\n  celestial system, stands in the centre of his moral obligations,\r\n  shedding upon them a hallowing light which they in their turn reflect\r\n  and absorb,--the duty of striving to prove by his life and\r\n  conversation the sincerity of his prayer that that Father's will may\r\n  be done upon earth as it is in heaven. I understand, sir, that upon\r\n  the broad and solemn platform which is raised upon that good\r\n  foundation, we invite the ministers of religion of all\r\n  denominations--the _de facto_ spiritual guides of the people of the\r\n  country--to take their stand along with us; that, so far from\r\n  hampering or impeding them in the exercise of their sacred functions,\r\n  we ask, and we beg them to take the children--the lambs of the flock\r\n  which are committed to their care--aside, and lead them to those\r\n  pastures and streams where they will find, as they believe it, the\r\n  food of life and the waters of consolation.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"Permit me in conclusion, to say, both as an humble Christian man and\r\n  as the head of the civil government of the province, that it gives me\r\n  unfeigned pleasure to perceive that the youth of this country, of all\r\n  denominations, who are destined in their maturer years to meet in the\r\n  discharge of the duties of civil life upon terms of perfect civil and\r\n  religious equality--I say it gives me pleasure to hear and to know\r\n  that they are receiving an education which is fitted so well to\r\n  qualify them for the discharge of these important duties, and that\r\n  while their hearts are yet tender and their affections yet green and\r\n  young, they are associated under conditions which are likely to\r\n  promote among them the growth of those truly Christian graces--mutual\r\n  respect, forbearance, and charity.\"\r\n\r\nThe position of the building is well chosen, being surrounded with\r\ncultivated ground sufficiently extensive to be usefully employed in\r\nillustrating the lectures given on vegetable physiology and agricultural\r\nchemistry. The rooms are all very lofty, airy, and scrupulously clean. A\r\nnotice at the entrance warns you--\"The dirty practice of spitting not\r\nallowed in this building;\" and as far as eye could discern, the notice\r\nis rigidly obeyed. I was told that a specific had been found to cure the\r\nfilthy habit. I mention it for the benefit of hotel-keepers and\r\nrailway-conductors, in all places where such a relic of barbarism may\r\nstill find a welcome. On a certain occasion, the lecturer having\r\nreceived undeniable proof that one of the students had violated the\r\nabove-mentioned regulation, stopped in the middle of one of his\r\nsublimest flights, repeated sonorously the notice, called the culprit by\r\nname, informed him that his endeavour to dissipate his filth into\r\ninfinity by the sole of his shoe was useless, and ordered him forthwith\r\nto take his handkerchief out and wipe it up clean. Disobedience was\r\nexpulsion: with crimson cheek he expiated his offence by obedience to\r\nthe order, and doubtless during the hushed silence in which he completed\r\nhis labour, he became a confirmed anti-expectorationist.\r\n\r\nGreat attention is very properly paid to cleanliness, inasmuch as if\r\nthese young men, who are destined to teach others, acquire filthy\r\nhabits, they naturally encourage the same vice in their pupils, and thus\r\nmay be almost said to nationalize it. All the tables and stools are\r\nfitted like those in the schools of the United States, which is an\r\nimmense improvement on the one long-desk and long form to match, which\r\npredominate all but universally at home. The instruction given is\r\nessentially by lecture and questioning; and I was particularly struck\r\nwith the quiet modulated tones in which the answers were given, and\r\nwhich clearly proved how much pains were taken upon this apparently\r\ntrifling, but really very important, point.[AR] You heard no harsh\r\ndeclamation grating on your ear; and, on the other hand, you were not\r\nlulled to sleep by dreary, dull monotony.\r\n\r\nThere are two small schools attached to the establishment, for these\r\nNormal aspirants, male and female, to practise upon, when considered\r\nsufficiently qualified. Those thus employed during my visit seemed to\r\nsucceed admirably, for I never saw more merry, cheerful faces, which I\r\nconsider one of the best tests of a master's efficiency. The little\r\ngirls, taking a fancy for music, purchased among themselves a cottage\r\npiano, which, being their own instrument, I have no doubt increased\r\ntheir interest in the study amazingly. The boys have a kind of gymnasium\r\nunder a shed, which, when released from school, they rush to with an\r\navidity only equalled by that which the reader may have experienced in\r\nhis early days when catching sight of a pastry-cook's shop immediately\r\nafter receiving his first tip.[AS]\r\n\r\nI believe that to this establishment, which was founded in 1846, belongs\r\nthe honour of being the Pioneer Normal School in the Western Hemisphere.\r\nBut while giving due credit to the Governor-General and the Government\r\nfor their leading parts in its foundation, it should never be forgotten,\r\nhow much indebted the establishment is to the unwearying zeal and\r\npatient investigations of Dr. Ryerson, the chief superintendent of\r\nschools in Canada. This gentleman carefully examined the various systems\r\nand internal arrangement of scholastic establishments, not only all over\r\nthe States, but in every country of the Old World, selecting from each\r\nthose features which seemed to produce the most comfort, the best\r\ninstruction, and the greatest harmony. The result of his inquiries I\r\nsubjoin from his own pen:--\r\n\r\n  \"Our system of public elementary instruction is eclectic, and is, to a\r\n  considerable extent, derived from four sources. The conclusions at\r\n  which the present head of the department arrived during his\r\n  observations and investigations of 1845, were, firstly: That the\r\n  machinery, or law part of the system, in the State of New York, was\r\n  the best upon the whole, appearing, however, defective in the\r\n  intricacy of some of its details, in the absence of an efficient\r\n  provision for the visitation and inspection of schools, the\r\n  examination of teachers, religious instruction, and uniform text-books\r\n  for the schools. Secondly. That the principle of supporting schools in\r\n  the State of Massachusetts was the best, supporting them all according\r\n  to property, and opening them to all without distinction; but that the\r\n  application of this principle should not be made by the requirements\r\n  of state or provincial statute, but at the discretion and by the\r\n  action, from year to year, of the inhabitants in each  school\r\n  municipality--thus avoiding the objection which might be made against\r\n  an uniform coercive law on this point, and the possible indifference\r\n  which might in some instances be induced by the provisions of such a\r\n  law--independent of local choice and action. Thirdly: That the series\r\n  of elementary text-books, prepared by experienced teachers, and\r\n  revised and published under the sanction of the National Board of\r\n  Education in Ireland, were, as a whole, the best adapted to schools in\r\n  Upper Canada--having long been tested, having been translated into\r\n  several languages of the continent of Europe, and having been\r\n  introduced more extensively than any other series of text-books into\r\n  the schools of England and Scotland. Fourthly: That the system of\r\n  normal-school training of teachers, and the principles and modes of\r\n  teaching which were found to exist in Germany, and which have been\r\n  largely introduced into other countries, were incomparably the\r\n  best--the system which makes school-teaching a profession, which, at\r\n  every stage, and in every branch of knowledge, teaches things and not\r\n  merely words, which unfolds and illustrates the principles of rules,\r\n  rather than assuming and resting upon their verbal authority, which\r\n  develops all the mental faculties instead of only cultivating and\r\n  loading the memory--a system which is solid rather than showy,\r\n  practical rather than ostentatious, which prompts to independent\r\n  thinking and action rather than to servile imitation.\r\n\r\n  \"Such are the sources from which the principal features of the school\r\n  system in Upper Canada have been derived, though the application of\r\n  each of them has been modified by the local circumstances of our\r\n  country. There is another feature, or rather cardinal principle of it,\r\n  which is rather indigenous than exotic, which is wanting in the\r\n  educational systems of some countries, and which is made the occasion\r\n  and instrument of invidious distinctions and unnatural proscriptions\r\n  in other countries; we mean the principle of not only making\r\n  Christianity the basis of the system, and the pervading element of all\r\n  its parts, but of recognising and combining in their official\r\n  character, all the clergy of the land, with their people, in its\r\n  practical operations--maintaining absolute parental supremacy in the\r\n  religious instruction of their children, and upon this principle\r\n  providing for it according to the circumstances, and under the\r\n  auspices of the elected trustee-representatives of each school\r\n  municipality. The clergy of the country have access to each of its\r\n  schools; and we know of no instance in which the school has been made\r\n  the place of religious discord; but many instances, especially on\r\n  occasions of quarterly public examinations, in which the school has\r\n  witnessed the assemblage and friendly intercourse of clergy of various\r\n  religious persuasions, and thus become the radiating centre of a\r\n  spirit of Christian charity and potent co-operation in the primary\r\n  work of a people's civilization and happiness.\"\r\n\r\nWith reference to religious instruction at the normal schools, Dr.\r\nRyerson has kindly furnished me with the following statement:--\"A part\r\nof each Friday afternoon is set apart for this purpose, and a room\r\nallowed for the minister of each of the religious persuasions of the\r\nstudents, to give instruction to the members of his church, who are\r\nrequired to attend, as also to attend the service of such church at\r\nleast once every Sunday. Hitherto we have found no difficulty,\r\nreluctance, or neglect, in giving full effect to this system.\"\r\n\r\nThe only difficulty in these matters that I have heard of, is a long\r\ndispute with the Roman Catholic bishop of Toronto; but such an event one\r\nmust be prepared for when dealing with a church which claims\r\ninfallibility. I have no doubt the tact and moderation of Dr. Ryerson\r\nhave ere this thrown oil on the troubled waters, and restored the\r\nharmony which existed between the former Roman bishop and the reverend\r\ndoctor. To those who take an interest in education, the report of the\r\nsystem used in Canada, drawn up by Dr. Ryerson, and printed by order of\r\nthe Legislative Assembly, will afford much pleasure and information. It\r\nis, of course, far too large a subject to enter upon in these pages,\r\ncontaining, as it does, so vast an amount of matter worthy of serious\r\nreflection. I will, however, indulge such of my friends as were taught\r\nto read in the last century, with a quotation from page 67, which will\r\nprobably astonish them.\r\n\r\nMr. Horace Mann, so long the able Secretary of the Board of Education in\r\nMassachusetts, after pointing out the absurdity of worrying a child's\r\nlife out, in teaching the A B C, &c., and their doubtful and\r\noften-varying sounds utterly destitute of meaning, instead of words\r\nwhich have distinct sounds and distinct meaning, thus winds\r\nup:--\"Learning his letters, therefore, gives him no new sound; it even\r\nrestricts his attention to a small number of those he already knows. So\r\nfar, then, the learning of his letters contracts his practice; and were\r\nit not for keeping up his former habits of speaking, at home and in the\r\nplayground, the teacher, during the six months or year in which he\r\nconfines him to the twenty-six sounds of the alphabet, would pretty near\r\ndeprive him of the faculty of speech.\"\r\n\r\nThis extract, from the pen of one who has devoted so much talent and\r\npatient investigation to the subject of education, entitles it to the\r\nserious consideration of all those who are in any way connected with the\r\nsame subject in this country, where the old A B C cramming all but\r\nuniversally prevails.--But to return to Upper Canada and its schools.\r\nSome estimate of the value of its scholastic establishments may be\r\nformed from the fact, that while its sphere of usefulness is rapidly\r\nextending, it has already reached the following honourable position: The\r\npopulation of Upper Canada is close upon 1,000,000; the number of\r\nchildren between the ages of 5 and 16 is 263,000; the number of children\r\non the rolls of the common school establishments is 179,587; and the\r\ngrand total of money available for these glorious purposes, is\r\n170,000l. I feel conscious that I have by no means done full justice\r\nto this important subject; but the limits of a work like this render it\r\nimpossible so to do. Let it suffice to say, that Upper Canada is\r\ninferior to none of its neighbouring rivals, as regards the quality of\r\ninstruction given; and that it is rapidly treading on the heels of the\r\nmost liberal of them, as regards the amount raised for its support. The\r\nnormal school, I conceive to be a model as nearly perfect as human\r\nagency has yet achieved; and the chemical and agricultural lectures\r\nthere given, and practically illustrated on the small farm adjoining the\r\nbuilding, cannot fail to produce most useful and important results in a\r\nyoung uncultivated country possessing the richest soil imaginable. The\r\nGovernor-General and the Government deserve every credit for the support\r\nand encouragement they have given to education; but, if I may draw a\r\ncomparison without being invidious, I would repeat, that it is to the\r\nunusual zeal and energy of Dr. Ryerson, to his great powers of\r\ndiscriminating and selecting what he found most valuable in the\r\ncountless methods he examined, and to his combination and adaptation of\r\nthem, that the colony is mainly indebted for its present admirable\r\nsystem. Well may Upper Canada be proud of her educational achievements,\r\nand in her past exertions read a hopeful earnest of a yet more noble\r\nfuture.[AT]\r\n\r\nBut it is not in education alone that Canada has been shadowing forth a\r\nnoble career. Emancipated from maternal apron-strings by a\r\nconstitutional self-government, and aided by the superior administrative\r\npowers of the Earl of Elgin, she has exhibited an innate vitality which\r\nhad so long been smothered by Imperial misrule as to cause a doubt of\r\nits existence; and if she has not shown it by the birth of populous\r\ncities, she has proved it by a more general and diffusive prosperity. A\r\nrevenue quadrupled in four years needs no Chicagos or Buffalos to\r\nendorse the colony's claims to energy and progress. Internal\r\nimprovements have also been undertaken on a large scale: railways are\r\nthreading their iron bands through waste and forest, and connecting in\r\none link all the North American colonies; the tubular bridge at Montreal\r\nwill be the most stupendous work yet undertaken by engineering skill;\r\ncanals are making a safe way for commerce, where a year or two back the\r\nroaring rapid threw its angry barrier. Population, especially in Upper\r\nCanada, is marching forward with hasty strides; the value of property is\r\nfast increasing; loyalty has supplanted discontent and rebellion; an\r\nimperial baby has become a princely colony, with as national an\r\nexistence as any kingdom of the Old World.[AU] These are facts upon\r\nwhich the colonists may, and do, look with feelings of both pride and\r\nsatisfaction; and none can more justly contemplate them with such\r\nemotions, than those through whose administrative talents these\r\nprosperous results have been produced, out of a state of chaos, in eight\r\nshort years. Dissatisfied men there ever will be among a large\r\ncommunity, and therefore questions of independence and annexation will\r\nbe mooted from time to time; but it seems hardly probable that a colony\r\nwhich enjoys an almost independent nationality would ever be disposed to\r\nresign that proud position, and to swamp her individuality among the\r\nthirty-three free and slave States of the adjoining Republic. At all\r\nevents, the colony, by her conduct with reference to the present war,\r\nhas shown that she is filled with a spirit of loyalty, devotion, and\r\nsympathy as true, as fervent, and as deep as those which animate all the\r\nother subjects of our beloved Sovereign.\r\n\r\nFarewell, Canada! May the sun of prosperity, which has been rising upon\r\nyou steadily for eight years, rise higher and higher, and never know\r\neither a cloud or a meridian! Canada, adieu!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote AR: My observations at various schools in the United States\r\nsatisfied me that no attention is paid by the teachers to the tone of\r\nvoice in which the boys give their answers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AS: The females are regularly taught calisthenics, and the\r\nboys gymnastics, by a professor.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AT: These remarks were made in 1853.

The pat of every float in the wheel,\r\nas it struck in the water, echoed with individual distinctness, and the\r\nhubbub created thereby, in the otherwise unruffled lake, left its trace\r\nvisible on the mirrory surface for so great a distance as to justify a\r\ndisputatious man in questioning whether the term \"trackless way\" was\r\napplicable to the course a vessel had passed over. Here we are, steaming\r\naway merrily for Niagara.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing interesting in scenery until you come to the entrance\r\nof the river, on the opposite sides of which stand Lewistown and\r\nQueenstown, and above the latter the ruthlessly mutilated remains of the\r\nmonument to the gallant Brock. The miscreant who perpetrated the vile\r\nact in 1841, has since fallen into the clutches of the law, and has\r\ndone--and, for aught I know, is now doing--penance in the New York\r\nState Prison at Auburn. I believe the Government are at last repairing\r\nit;--better late than never. The precipitous banks on either side\r\nclearly indicate they are the silent and persevering work of the\r\never-rolling stream, and leave no doubt upon any reflecting mind that\r\nthey must lead to some fall or cataract, though no reflection can fully\r\nrealize the giant cataract of Niagara.\r\n\r\nThere are several country places on the banks, and the whole appearance\r\nbespeaks comfort and civilization. Far away in the distance is to be\r\nseen the suspension-bridge, high in mid-air, and straight as the arrow's\r\nflight. On either bank rival railroads are in progress; that on the\r\nCanada side is protected from the yawning abyss by a wall calculated to\r\ndefy the power of steam. The boat touches at Queenstown, and thence\r\nproceeds to Lewistown, where a stage is waiting for Niagara City. No\r\nbotherations of custom-house--what a blessing! The distance to ride is\r\nseven miles, and the time one hour; but in the United States, you are\r\naware, every chap will \"do as he best pleases;\" consequently, there is a\r\nlittle information to be obtained from the fresh arrival, a cock-tail\r\nwith a friend or two, a quiet piling on of luggage, &c.; all this takes\r\na long half-hour, and away we go with four tough little nags. A\r\ntremendous long hill warms their hides and cools their mettle, though by\r\nno means expending it. On we go, merrily; Jehu, a free-and-easy,\r\nwell-informed companion, guessing at certainties and calculating on\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nAt last we reach a spring by the roadside, the steam rising from the\r\nflanks of the team like mist from a marsh. What do I see? Number one nag\r\nwith a pailful of water, swigging away like a Glasgow baillie at a bowl\r\nof punch. He drains it dry with a rapidity which says \"More, more!\" and\r\nsure enough they keep on giving pail after pail, till he has taken in\r\nenough to burst the tough hide of a rhinoceros. I naturally concluded\r\nthe horse was an invalid, or a culprit who had got drunk, and that they\r\nwere mixing the liquor \"black list\" fashion, to save his intestines and\r\nto improve his manners; but no--round goes the pailman to every nag,\r\ndrenching each to the bursting point.\r\n\r\n\"Ain't you afraid,\" I said, \"of killing the poor beasts by giving them\r\nsuch a lot of water?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess if I was, I shouldn't give it 'em,\" was the terse reply.\r\n\r\nUpon making further inquiries into this mysterious treatment, he told me\r\nthat it was a sulphur spring, and that all tired horses having exhibited\r\nan avidity for it far greater than for common water, the instinct of the\r\nanimal had been given a fair trial, and subsequent experience had so\r\nratified that instinct that it had become a \"known fact.\" An intelligent\r\nAmerican, sitting at the feet of a quadruped Gamaliel, humbly learning\r\nfrom his instincts, should teach the bigots of every class and clime to\r\nlet their prejudices hang more loosely upon them. But half an hour has\r\npassed, and Jehu is again on the box, the nags as fresh as daisies, and\r\nas full as a corncob. Half an hour more lands us at Niagara. Avoiding\r\nthe hum of men, I took refuge for the night in a snug little cottage\r\nhandy to the railway, and, having deposited my traps, started on a\r\nmoonlight trip. I need scarce say whither.\r\n\r\nMen of the highest and loftiest minds, men of the humblest and simplest\r\nminds, the poet and the philosopher, the shepherd and the Christian,\r\nhave alike borne testimony to the fact, that the solitude of night tends\r\nto solemnize and elevate the thoughts. How greatly must this effect be\r\nincreased when aided by the contemplation of so grand a work of nature\r\nas Niagara! In the broad blaze of a noonday sun, the power of such\r\ncontemplation is weakened by the forced admixture of the earthly\r\nelement, interspersed as the scene is with the habitations and works of\r\nman. But, in the hushed repose of night, man stands, as it were, more\r\nalone with his Maker. The mere admirer of the picturesque or the grand\r\nwill find much to interest and charm him; but may there not arise in the\r\nChristian's mind far deeper and higher thoughts to feed his\r\ncontemplation? In the cataract's mighty roar may he not hear a voice\r\nproclaiming the anger of an unreconciled God? May not the soft beams of\r\nthe silvery moon above awaken thoughts of the mercies of a pardoning\r\nGod? And as he views those beams, veiled, as it wore, in tears by the\r\nrising spray, may he not think of Him and his tears, through whom alone\r\nthose mercies flow to man? May not yon mist rising heavenward recal his\r\nglorious hopes through an ascended Saviour; and as it falls again\r\nperpetually and imperceptibly, may it not typify the dew of the Holy\r\nSpirit--ever invisible, ever descending--the blessed fruit of that Holy\r\nAscension? And if the mind be thus insensibly led into such a train of\r\nthought, may not the deep and rugged cliff, worn away by centuries\r\nunnumbered by man, shadow forth to him ideas of that past Eternity,\r\ncompared to which they are but as a span; and may not the rolling\r\nstream, sweeping onward in rapid and unceasing flight into the abyss\r\nbeneath his feet, fill his soul with the contemplation of Time's flight,\r\nwhich, alike rapid and continuous, is ever bearing him nearer and nearer\r\nto the brink of that future Eternity in which all his highest and\r\nbrightest hopes will be more than realized in the enjoyment of a\r\nhappiness such as \"eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither hath it\r\nentered into the heart of man to conceive.\" Say, then, reader, is not\r\nevery element of thought which can arise between a Christian and his\r\nCreator symbolled forth here in equal beauty and grandeur? One, indeed,\r\nis wanting, which, alas! none of Nature's works but man can supply--that\r\nsad element, which those who search their own hearts the deepest will\r\nfeel the most.--I feel I have departed from the legitimate subject of\r\ntravels; let the majesty of the scene plead my excuse.\r\n\r\nAdieu, Niagara.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning I put myself into a railway car, and in due time\r\nreached Batavia. On my arrival, being rather hungry, I made a modest\r\nrequest for a little brandy and some biscuits; fancy my astonishment\r\nwhen the \"help\" said, \"I guess we only give meals at the fixed hours.\"\r\nAs I disapproved very much of such an unreasonable and ridiculous\r\nrefusal, I sought out the chief, and, preferring my modest request to\r\nhim, was readily supplied with my simple luncheon. In the meantime a\r\nlight fly had been prepared, and off I started for Geneseo. The road\r\npresented the usual features of rich cultivated land, a dash of wild\r\nforest, a bit of bog, and ruts like drains; and each hamlet or village\r\nexhibited a permanent or an ambulating daguerreotype shop. Four hours\r\nhoused me with my kind and hospitable friends at Geneseo.\r\n\r\nAs the chances of travel had brought me to a small country village at\r\nthe time of the annual celebration of the 4th of July, I was unable to\r\nwitness the ceremony on the grand scale in which it is conducted in the\r\nlarge cities of the Union; and, as I think it is frequently accompanied\r\nwith circumstances which are entitled to some consideration, I shall\r\nrevert, in a subsequent chapter, to those points which appear to me\r\ncalculated to act upon the national character. On the present occasion I\r\nwas delighted to find that, although people all \"liquored\" freely, there\r\nwas scarcely any drunkenness; at all events, they had their little bit\r\nof fun, such as we see at fairs at home. By way of enabling those who\r\nhave a turn for the facetious to share in their jokes, I insert a couple\r\nof specimens:--\r\n\r\n  \"ORDER OF THE DAY.\r\n\r\n  \"The vast multitude will be assembled on the Public Square, in rear of\r\n  the Candy Factory, under the direction of Marshal JOHN A.

Fare to suit\r\n  passengers.\r\n\r\n  \"The public's very much obliged servant, &c. &c.\"\r\n\r\nA quiet and simple stage of rough wood was put up at one end of the\r\nvillage, close to the Court-house, from whence the Declaration of\r\nIndependence was read, after which a flowery orator--summoned for the\r\noccasion, and who travels about to different villages in different years\r\nwith his well-digested oration--addressed the multitude. Of course\r\nsimiles and figures of rhetoric were lugged in by the heels in every\r\nsentence, as is the all but universal practice on such occasions in\r\nevery part of the world. The moral of his speech was in the main\r\ndecidedly good, and he urged upon his audience strongly, \"the undying\r\nadvantages of cultivating pluck and education\" in preference to \"dollars\r\nand shrewdness.\" All went off in a very orderly manner, and in the\r\nevening there were fireworks and a village ball. It was at once a wild\r\nand interesting sight during the fireworks; the mixture of men, women,\r\nand children, some walking, some carried, some riding, some driving;\r\nempty buggies, some with horses, some without, tied all round; stray\r\ndogs looking for masters as hopelessly as old maids seeking for their\r\nspectacles when raised above their eyes and forgotten. Fire companies\r\nparading ready for any emergency; the son of mine host tugging away at\r\nthe rope of the engine in his red shirt, like a juvenile Atlas, as proud\r\nas Lucifer, as pleased as Punch. All busy, all excited, all happy; no\r\nglimpse of poverty to mar the scene; all come with one voice and one\r\nheart to celebrate the glorious anniversary of the birth of a nation,\r\nwhose past gigantic strides, unparalleled though they be, are\r\ninsufficient to enable any mind to realize what future is in store for\r\nher, if she only prove true to herself.\r\n\r\nLeave-takings do not interest the public, so the reader will be\r\nsatisfied to know that two days after found me in an open carriage on my\r\nway to Rochester. The road lay entirely through cultivated land, and had\r\nno peculiar features. The only thing I saw worth noticing, was two men\r\nin a light four-wheel one-horse shay, attached to which were at least a\r\ndozen others, some on two wheels, some on four. I of course thought\r\nthey were some country productions going to a city manufacturer. What\r\nwas my astonishment at finding upon inquiry, that it was merely an\r\nAmerican phase of hawking. The driver told me that these people will go\r\naway from home for weeks together, trying to sell their novel ware at\r\nhamlet, village, farm-house, &c., and that some of the shrewdest of\r\nthem, the genuine Sam Slick breed, manage to make a good thing of it.\r\n\r\nThe shades of evening closed in upon me as I alighted at a very\r\ncomfortable hotel at Rochester. The amiable Morpheus soon claimed me as\r\nhis own, nor was I well pleased when ruthlessly dragged from his soft\r\nembrace at 6-1/2 A.M. the following morning; but railways will not wait\r\nfor Morpheus or any other deity of fancy or fiction; so, making the best\r\nuse I could of a tub of water and a beefsteak, and calming my temper\r\nwith a fragrant weed, I was soon ensconced in one of their cars, a\r\npassenger to New York.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Albany, we crossed the river and threw ourselves into the\r\ncars of the Hudson River Railway, which, running close to the margin\r\nnearly all the way, gives you an ever-varying view of the charming\r\nscenery of this magnificent stream. Yankee industry was most\r\ndisagreeably prominent at several of the stations, in the shape of a\r\nbevy of unwashed urchins parading the cars with baskets of the eternal\r\npea-nut and various varieties of lollipop, lemonade, &c., all crying out\r\ntheir wares, and finding as ready a sale for them as they would at any\r\nschool in England. The baiting-place was not very tempting; we all\r\nhuddled into one room, where everything was hurry and confusion: besides\r\nwhich, the appetite was not strengthened by the sight of hands--whose\r\nowners seemed to have \"registered a vow in heaven,\" to forego the use of\r\nsoap--turning over the sandwiches, one after another, until they had\r\nmade their selection. However, the majority approve of the system; and\r\nas no thought is given to the minority, \"if you don't like it, you may\r\nlump it.\"\r\n\r\nBut the more permanent inconvenience of this railroad is one for which\r\nthe majority cannot be held responsible, i.e., it runs three-fourths\r\nof the way over a bed of granite, and often between cuts in the solid\r\ngranite rock, the noise therefore is perfectly stunning; and when to\r\nthis you add the echoing nature of their long wooden cars, destitute of\r\nanything to check the vibrations of sound, except the human cargo and\r\nthe cushions they sit upon, and when you add further the eternal\r\nslamming of the doors at each end by the superintending conductor and\r\nthe inquisitive portion of the passengers, you may well conceive that\r\nthis combination is enough to rouse the slumbers of the dead, and rack\r\nthe brains of the living. At the same time, I must allow that this line\r\nruns the best pace and keeps the best time of any in the Union.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the outskirts of New York, I asked, \"Is this the proper\r\nplace for me to get out at?\" And being answered in the affirmative, I\r\nalighted, and found myself in a broad open street. Scarce had I set my\r\nfoot on the ground, when I saw the train going on again, and therefore\r\nasked for my luggage. After a few questions and answers, I ascertained\r\nit had gone on in the train about three miles further; and the only\r\nconsolation I got, was being told, \"I guess you'd best have gone on\r\ntoo.\" However, all troubles must have an end; so getting into a hackney,\r\nI drove to my hospitable friend Phelps' house, where, under the\r\ninfluence of glorious old Madeira--P. had just finished dinner--and most\r\nundeniable claret, the past was soon buried in the present; and by the\r\ntime I had knocked the first ash off one of his best \"_prensados_,\" the\r\nstray luggage returned from the involuntary trip it had made on its own\r\naccount. What a goodly cheery thing is hospitality, when it flows pure\r\nfrom a warm heart; nor does it lose aught in my estimation when viewed\r\nthrough the medium of a first-rate cellar and the social \"Havana.\"\r\n\r\nTime progresses--small hours approach--the front door shuts behind some\r\nof the guests--six-foot-two of animal life may be seen going up-stairs\r\nwith a bed-candle; the latter is soon out, and your humble servant is\r\nsnug in the former.--Reader, good-night!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n_Education, Civil and Military_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving said so much of education in other cities, I will only observe,\r\nthat in regard to common schools, New York is on a par with most of her\r\nrivals in this noble strife for superiority; but I must ask those who\r\nare interested in the subject to give me their attention while I enter\r\ninto a few details connected with their admirable Free Academy. The\r\nobject of this institution is to combine--under one system and under one\r\nroof--high school, academy, polytechnic, and college, and to furnish as\r\ngood an education as can be obtained by passing through each of those\r\nplaces of instruction separately. All this free of cost!\r\n\r\nA sum of 10,000l. was authorized for the building, and 4000l.\r\nannually for its support. The course of instruction is divided into\r\nthirteen departments, with a professor at the head of each, aided by\r\ntutors where necessary; the whole under a principal, with a salary of\r\n500l. a year, who is at the same time professor of moral,\r\nintellectual, and political philosophy. The salaries of the other\r\nprofessors average 300l. a year, those of the tutors 100l. The\r\ncourse of study embraces all that is taught at the four different places\r\nof education before-named. The student is allowed to make his selection\r\nbetween the classical languages and the modern--French, Spanish, and\r\nGerman. The whole course occupies five years. The requisites for\r\nadmission are, that the applicant be thirteen years old, living in the\r\ncity of New York, and have attended the common schools for eighteen\r\nmonths; besides which he is required to pass a moderate examination. The\r\nnumber of students at present is about 350, but they will doubtless\r\nincrease. If to the annual expenses of the institution be added the\r\ninterest at six per cent, on the outlay, the instruction given will be\r\nfound to cost the inconceivably small sum of 13l. 5s. per scholar,\r\nincluding books, stationery, and etceteras.\r\n\r\nMr. S.B. Ruggles was kind enough to introduce me to Mr. Horace Webster,\r\nby whom I was shown over the whole establishment. The cleanliness and\r\ngood ventilation certainly exceeded that of any other similar\r\nestablishment which I had visited in the United States. There is a very\r\ngood library containing 3000 volumes, besides 8000 which are used as\r\ntext-books, or books of reference. Many publishers supplied the\r\nrequisite books at reduced prices, which, as long as they retain the\r\nignominious position of the literary pirates of the world, I suppose\r\nthey can afford to do without inconvenience. There is also a fine\r\nstudio, full of casts from the best models, and copies of the Elgin\r\nmarbles presented by Mr. Leap. Instruments of the best quality abound\r\nfor the explanation of all the sciences taught.\r\n\r\nIn one of the rooms which I entered there was an examination going on.\r\nThe subject was astronomy, and it was the first class. I was\r\nparticularly struck with the very clear manner in which the lad under\r\nexamination replied to the questions put to him, and I began to suspect\r\nit was merely something he had learnt by rote; but the professor dodged\r\nhim about in such a heartless manner with his \"whys\" and his\r\n\"wherefores,\" his \"how do you knows\" and \"how do you proves,\" that I\r\nquite trembled for the victim. Vain fears on my part; nothing could put\r\nhim out; he seemed as much at home as the professor, and answered all\r\nthe questions propounded to him in language as clear and simple as that\r\nwhich the great Faraday employs to instruct his eager listeners at the\r\nRoyal Institution. Not once could the professor make him trip during the\r\nlong half-hour of his searching examination. Having remarked that the\r\nappearance of the student was rather that of a labouring than of a\r\nwealthy stock, I asked the principal who he was. \"That, sir,\" replied\r\nMr. Webster, \"is one of our best students, and he is the son of a poor\r\njourneyman blacksmith.\"\r\n\r\nNew York may point with just pride to her Free Academy, and say, \"In\r\nour city the struggling efforts of genius are never cramped by the chill\r\nblast of poverty, for within those walls the avenues to the highest\r\nbranches of literature and science are opened without charge to the\r\nhumblest and most destitute of our citizens.\" I spent several hours in\r\nthis most admirable and interesting institution, so ably presided over\r\nby Mr. Horace Webster, through whose kindness I was provided with the\r\nfull details of all its workings. It would seem that the best class of\r\nschools for young ladies are not very numerous, for the papers announced\r\nthe other day that Mrs. Okill had realized 250,000 dollars by her\r\nestablishment, which could hardly have been the case in the face of good\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards Mr. Ruggles offered to accompany me in a visit I\r\nwished to make to the National Military College of West Point. I gladly\r\naccepted his proffered kindness, and in due time we were rattling away\r\nover the granite-bottomed railroad, along the banks of the Hudson. Close\r\nto the station we found a small ferry-boat, ready to take us across to\r\nthe southern bank. On landing at West Point, \"my pipe was immediately\r\nput out\" by a summary order from a sentry on the wharf. Dropping a tear\r\nof sorrow through a parting whiff, and hurling the precious stump into\r\nthe still waters of the little bay, I followed my cicerone up the hill,\r\nand soon found myself in the presence of one of the professors, through\r\nwhose assistance we were enabled thoroughly to lionize every department.\r\nAs many of my military friends who have visited West Point have spoken\r\nto me in terms of the highest admiration of the institution, I propose\r\nentering more into detail than I otherwise might have thought requisite;\r\nand I trust that, as military education is engaging a great deal of\r\npublic interest, the following observations may be found worthy of\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe candidates for admission are nominated by the members of Congress,\r\none for each congressional district, in addition to which the President\r\nof the United States has the nomination of forty from the Republic at\r\nlarge.[AV] The requisites for admission are--the passing a very easy\r\nexamination, being a bachelor between the ages of sixteen and\r\ntwenty-one, and having no physical defect. The pay of each cadet is\r\nabout five pounds a month, of which his board takes two pounds, and\r\n8s. 6d. is laid aside monthly, whereby to form a fund to assist him\r\nin the expenses of equipment upon leaving. The balance provides for his\r\ndress and other expenses, and a treasurer is appointed to superintend\r\nand keep the accounts. The routine of duty prescribed is the\r\nfollowing:--Rise at 5 A.M. in summer, and 5-1/2 in winter; double up bed\r\nand mattress, &c., and study till 7; then fall in and go to breakfast;\r\nat 7-1/2, guard-mounting--twenty-four cadets are on guard every day; at\r\n8, study; at 1 o'clock, break up, fall in, and go to dinner, which they\r\nrise from at the word of command, and are then free till 2. From 2 P.M.\r\nto 4, study; at 4, drill for one hour and a half, after which they are\r\nfree till sunset; at sunset, parade in front of the barracks, and\r\ndelinquents' names called over; then follows supper, after which the\r\ncadets are free till 8, at which time there is a call to quarters, and\r\nevery cadet is required to retire to his own room and study till 9-1/2,\r\nwhen the tattoo is beat; at 10, there is a roll of the drum, at sound\r\nwhereof every light must be out and every student in bed.\r\n\r\nThe cadets are organized into a battalion of four companies; the\r\nofficers and non-commissioned officers are all appointed by the\r\nsuperintendent, from a list submitted to him by the commandant of\r\ncadets, the selection being made from those most advanced in their\r\nstudies and most exemplary in their conduct; they perform in every\r\nparticular the same duties as those of the officers and privates of a\r\nregiment; they have divisions and sub-divisions, with superintendent\r\ncadets attached to each, regular orderlies who sweep and clean out the\r\nroom, furniture, &c.: guards are regularly mounted, an officer of the\r\nday duly appointed, and all the duties of a regular barrack punctually\r\nperformed, even to the sentinels being supplied with ball-cartridge at\r\nnight. Their uniform is of grey cloth, and their hair is kept a close\r\ncrop; neither whiskers nor moustache are tolerated, and liquor and\r\ntobacco are strictly prohibited. The punishments consist of privation of\r\nrecreation, extra duty, reprimand, arrest or confinement to room or\r\ntent, confinement to light or dark prison, dismission with privilege of\r\nresigning, and public dismission; the former of these are at the will of\r\nthe superintendent--confinement to prison and dismission are by sentence\r\nof a court-martial.\r\n\r\nThe course of studies pursued are classed under twelve heads:--1.\r\nInfantry tactics and military police; 2. Mathematics; 3. French; 4.\r\nDrawing; 5. Chemistry, mineralogy, and geology; 6. Natural and\r\nexperimental philosophy; 7. Artillery tactics, science of gunnery, and\r\nthe duties of the military laboratory; 8. Cavalry tactics; 9. The use\r\nof the sword; 10. Practical military engineering; 11. Grammar,\r\ngeography, ethics, &c.; 12. Military and civil engineering, and the\r\nscience of war.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding pages we have seen that ten hours are daily devoted to\r\nstudy, besides an hour and a half to drill; and thus, while the brain is\r\nseverely taxed, but little leisure is left to get into those minor\r\nscrapes so prevalent at most public schools.\r\n\r\nThere is a most minute system of merit and demerit established;\r\neverything good and everything bad has a specific value in numbers and\r\ndecimals, which is accurately recorded against the owners thereof in the\r\nreports made for each year. The cadet appears to be expected to improve\r\nin conduct as well as knowledge; for, according to the rules, after his\r\nfirst year is completed, the number expressing his absolute demerit is\r\nincreased by one-sixth during the second year, by one-third during the\r\nthird year, and by one-half during the fourth year. Thus, suppose a\r\ncertain number of faults to be represented by the sum of 36, if faults\r\nwhich those figures represent are committed during the second year of\r\nthe cadet's course, one-sixth would be added, and his name appear on the\r\ndemerit list with 42 against it; if in the third year, one-third would\r\nbe added to the 36, and 48 would be placed against his name; and if\r\nduring the fourth year, one-half would be added, and 54 would appear\r\nagainst it. It will thus be seen that, supposing offences of equal value\r\nto be committed by the cadet in his first year and by another in his\r\nfourth year, the figures of demerit against the latter would be one-half\r\nmore than those placed against the name of the cadet in his first year.\r\nA demerit conduct roll is made out each year, and a copy sent to the War\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nThere is also a general merit roll of proficiency and good conduct sent\r\nto the same department, an abstract whereof, with demerit added, is sent\r\nto the parents or guardians in a printed book containing the names of\r\nall the cadets, by which they can at once see the relative position of\r\ntheir son or ward. The following tables will explain the system adopted\r\nfor ascertaining the merit, demerit, and qualifications of the\r\nstudents:--\r\n\r\nDEMERIT.\r\n\r\n_Degree of Criminality of Offences, arranged in Classes_.\r\n\r\n  1.

I have dwelt very lengthily upon the\r\nsystem adopted of recording and publishing the merit and demerit of the\r\nstudents, because I was informed of the admirable effect produced by it.\r\nAs far as I can judge, it certainly appears not only an admirable means\r\nof enabling the War-office to estimate character, but the great\r\npublicity given to it must act as a powerful stimulus to exertion and\r\ngood conduct.\r\n\r\nA portion of the cadets are instructed every day in fencing and riding.\r\nWhen well advanced in the latter, they are taught spearing rings or\r\nstuffed heads at the gallop, and the same with the sword. The\r\nriding-school is perfectly abominable, being dark, full of pillars, and\r\nmost completely out of harmony with all the rest of the establishment,\r\nwhich is excellent in every detail. On Sundays all the cadets attend\r\nchurch, unless excused on conscientious motives, and with the approval\r\nof their parents. The minister is selected by the President, and may be\r\nof any denomination. I was told that an Episcopalian had been most\r\nfrequently chosen. The present minister is, I believe, a Presbyterian.\r\nDuring the months of July and August the cadets all turn out of their\r\nbarracks, pitch their tents, and live regular camp life--only going to\r\nthe barracks to eat their meals. During the time they are tented, the\r\neducation is exclusively military practice; the same hours are kept as\r\nin the barracks; the tents are boarded, and two cadets sleep in each.\r\nThey are all pitched with scrupulous accuracy, and they are obliged to\r\nkeep their camp as clean as a new pin--performing among themselves every\r\nduty of a complete regiment--cleaning their own shoes, fetching their\r\nown water, &c. They were all in tents at the time of my visit, and I\r\nfear not particularly comfortable, for there had been two days and\r\nnights' hard rain, and the wet mattresses were courting the warm rays of\r\nthe afternoon sun. Whatever jobbery is attempted in the selection of\r\ncandidates for admission to the Academy, is soon corrected by the\r\nAcademy itself; for, though the entrance examination is simple to a\r\ndegree, the subsequent examinations are very severe, and those who\r\ncannot come up to the mark get notice to quit; and the unerring\r\ntell-tale column of demerit soon obliges the turbulent to \"clear out.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of this system is, that when I saw them under arms, their\r\nsoldierlike appearance struck me very much; and the effect produced upon\r\nthem by discipline was very marked. You might almost guess the time they\r\nhad been there by their gentlemanly bearing, a quality which they do not\r\nreadily lose; for the officers of the American army who have been\r\neducated at West Point, enjoy a universal reputation for intelligence\r\nand gentlemanly bearing wherever they are to be met with.\r\n\r\nThe discipline here is no fiction; they do not play at soldiers; they\r\nall work their way up from the ranks, performing every duty of each\r\nrank, and the most rigid obedience is exacted. In the calculations for\r\ndemerit, while idleness in the Academy obtains a mark of three,\r\ndisobedience to a superior officer is marked eight. There is no bullying\r\nthought of here; the captain of his company would as soon think of\r\nbullying the cadet private as a captain of a regiment of the line would\r\nof bullying any private under his command. An officer who had been for\r\nmany years connected with West Point, told me that among all the duels\r\nwhich unfortunately are so prevalent in the United States, he had never\r\neither known or heard of one between any two gentlemen who had received\r\ntheir education at this Academy--tricks, of course, are sometimes\r\nplayed, but nothing oppressive is ever thought of.\r\n\r\nI did hear a story of a cadet, who, by way of a joke, came and tried to\r\ntake away the musket of a wiry young Kentuckian, who was planted sentry\r\nfor the first time; but he found a military ardour he had little\r\nanticipated; for the novice sentry gave him a crack on the side of the\r\nhead that turned him round, and before he could recover himself, he felt\r\na couple of inches of cold steel running into the bank situated at the\r\njuncture of the hips and the back-bone; and thus not only did he suffer\r\ntotal defeat and an ignominious wound, but he earned a large figure on\r\nthe demerit roll. From the way the story was told to me, I imagine it is\r\na solitary instance of such an outrage being attempted; for one of the\r\nfirst things they seek to inculcate is a military spirit, and the young\r\nKentuckian at all events proved that he had caught the spirit; nor can\r\nit be denied that the method he took to impress it upon his assailant,\r\nas a fundamental principle of action, was equally sharp and striking.\r\n\r\nHappening to be on the ground at the hour of dinner, I saw them all\r\nmarched off to their great dining-ball, where the table was well\r\nsupplied with meat, vegetables, and pudding; it was all substantial and\r\ngood, but the _tout-ensemble_ was decidedly very rough. If the intention\r\nis to complete the soldier life by making them live like well-fed\r\nprivates of the line, the object is attained; but I should be disposed\r\nto think, they might dispense with a good deal of the roughness of the\r\nstyle with great advantage; though doubtless, where the general\r\narrangements are so good, they have their own reasons for keeping it as\r\nit is. I paid a visit in the course of the afternoon to the\r\nfencing-room; but being the hour of recreation, I found about thirty\r\nlusty cadets, votaries to Terpsichore, all waltzing and polking merrily\r\nto a fiddle, ably wielded by their instructor: as their capabilities\r\nwere various, the confusion was great, and the master bewildered; but\r\nthey all seemed heartily enjoying themselves.\r\n\r\nThe professors and military instructors, &c., have each a small\r\ncomfortable house with garden attached, and in the immediate vicinity of\r\nthe Academy. There is a comfortable hotel, which in the summer months is\r\nconstantly filled with the friends and relatives of the cadets; and\r\noccasionally they get permission to give a little _soirée dansante_ in\r\nthe fencing-room. The hotel is prohibited from selling any spirituous\r\nliquors, wines, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Government property at West Point consists of about three thousand\r\nacres: the Academy, professors' houses, hotel, &c., are built upon a\r\nlarge plateau, commanding a magnificent view of the Hudson both ways.\r\nThe day I was there, the scene was quite lovely; the noble stream was as\r\nsmooth as a mirror; a fleet of rakish schooners lay helpless, their\r\nsnow-white sails hanging listlessly in the calm; and, as the clear\r\nwaters reflected everything with unerring truthfulness, another fleet\r\nappeared beneath, lying keel to keel with those that floated on the\r\nsurface. With such beautiful scenery, and so far removed from the bustle\r\nand strife of cities, I cannot conceive any situation better adapted\r\nfor health and study, pleasure and exercise.\r\n\r\nThe great day of the year is that of the annual review of the cadets by\r\na board of gentlemen belonging to the different States of the Union, and\r\nappointed by the Secretary of War; it takes place early in June, I\r\nbelieve, and consequently before the cadets take the tented field. The\r\nexamination goes on in the library hall, which is a very fine room, and\r\nhung with portraits of some of their leading men; the library is a very\r\nfair one, and the cadets have always easy access to it, to assist them\r\nin their studies. I could have spent many more hours here with much\r\npleasure, but the setting sun warned us no time was to be lost if we\r\nwished to save the train; so, bidding adieu, to the friends who had so\r\nkindly afforded me every assistance in accomplishing the object of my\r\nvisit, I returned to the great Babylon, after one of the most\r\ninteresting and gratifying days I had spent in America.[AW]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote AV: By the published class-list the numbers at present are\r\n224.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AW: An account of a visit to this Academy, from the pen of Sir\r\nJ. Alexander, is published in Golburn's _United Service Magazine,_\r\nSeptember, 1854.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n_Watery Highways and Metallic Intercourse._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps scarcely any feature in which the United States differ\r\nmore from the nations of the Old World, than in the unlimited extent of\r\ntheir navigable waters, the value of which has been incalculably\r\nincreased by the introduction of steam. By massing these waters\r\ntogether, we shall be the better able to appreciate their importance;\r\nbut in endeavouring to do this, I can only offer an approximation as to\r\nthe size of the lakes, from the want of any official information, in the\r\nabsence of which I am forced to take my data from authorities that\r\nsometimes differ widely. I trust the following statement will be found\r\nsufficiently accurate to convey a tolerably correct idea.\r\n\r\nThe seaboard on each ocean may be estimated at 1500 miles; the\r\nMississippi and its tributaries, at 17,000 miles; Lake Ontario, at 190\r\nmiles by 50; Lake Erie, at 260 miles by 60; Lake Huron, at 200 miles by\r\n70; the Georgian Bay, at 160 miles, one half whereof is about 50 broad;\r\nLake Michigan, at 350 miles by 60; and Lake Superior, at 400 miles by\r\n160, containing 32,000 square miles, and almost capable of floating\r\nEngland, if its soil were as buoyant as its credit. All the lakes\r\ncombined contain about 100,000 square miles. The rate at which the\r\ntonnage upon them is increasing, appears quite fabulous. In 1840 it\r\namounted to 75,000 tons, from which it had risen in 1850 to 216,000\r\ntons. Besides the foregoing, there are the eastern rivers, and the deep\r\nbays on the ocean board. Leaving, however, these latter out of the\r\nquestion, let us endeavour to realize in one sum the extent of soil\r\nbenefited by this bountiful provision of Providence; to do which it is\r\nnecessary to calculate both sides of the rivers and the shores of the\r\nlakes, which, of course, must be of greater extent than double the\r\nlength of the lakes: nevertheless, if we estimate them at only double,\r\nwe shall find that there are 40,120 miles washed by their navigable\r\nwaters; and by the constitution of the Union these waters are declared\r\nto be \"common property, for ever free, without any tax, duty, or impost\r\nwhatever.\"\r\n\r\nThe Americans are not free from the infirmities of human nature; and\r\nhaving got a \"good thing\" among them, in process of time it became a\r\nbone of contention, which it still remains: the Whigs contending that\r\nthe navigable waters having been declared by the constitution \"for ever\r\nfree,\" are national waters, and as such, entitled to have all necessary\r\nimprovements made at the expense of the Union; their opponents\r\nasserting, that rivers and harbours are not national, but local, and\r\nthat their improvements should be exclusively committed to the\r\nrespective States. This latter opinion sounds strange indeed, when it is\r\nremembered that the Mississippi and its tributaries bathe the shores of\r\nsome thirteen States, carrying on their bosoms produce annually valued\r\nat 55,000,000l. sterling, of which 500,000l. is utterly destroyed\r\nfrom the want of any sufficient steps to remove the dangers of\r\nnavigation.[AX]\r\n\r\nMr. Ruggles has always been a bold and able advocate of the Whig\r\ndoctrine of nationality; and, in a lecture delivered by him upon the\r\nsubject, he states that during the recent struggle to pass the River and\r\nHarbour Bill through the Senate, Mr. Douglas, a popular democrat from\r\nIllinois, offered as a substitute an amendment giving the consent of\r\nCongress \"to the levy of local tonnage dues, not only by each of the\r\nseparate States, but even by the authorities of any city or town.\" One\r\ncan hardly conceive any man of the most ordinary intellect deliberately\r\nproposing to inflict upon his country the curse of an unlimited legion\r\nof custom-houses, arresting commerce in every bend of the river and in\r\nevery bay of the sea; yet such was the case, though happily the\r\nproposition was not carried. How inferior does the narrow mind which\r\nmade the above proposition in 1848 appear, when placed beside the\r\nprescient mind which in 1787 proposed and carried, \"That navigable\r\nwaters should be for ever free from any tax or impost whatever!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most extraordinary instances of routine folly which I ever\r\nread or heard of, and which, among so practical and unroutiney a\r\npeople as the Americans, appears all but incredible, is the\r\nfollowing:--Congress having resisted the Harbour Improvement Bill, but\r\nacknowledged its duties as to certain lights and beacons, \"Ordered, that\r\na beacon should be placed on a rock in the harbour of New Haven. The\r\nengineer reported, that the cost of removing the rock would be less than\r\nthe cost of erecting the beacon; but the President was firm--a great\r\nparty doctrine was involved, and the rock remains to uphold the\r\nbeacon--a naked pole, with an empty barrel at its head--a suitable type\r\nof the whole class of constitutional obstructions.\"[AY]\r\n\r\nThe State of New York may fairly claim the credit of having executed one\r\nof the most--if not the most--valuable public works in the Union--the\r\nErie Canal. At the time of its first proposal, it received the most\r\nstubborn opposition, especially from that portion of the democratic\r\nparty known by the appellation of \"Barn-burners,\" whose creed is thus\r\ndescribed in a pamphlet before me:--\"All accumulations of wealth or\r\npower, whether in associations, corporate bodies, public works, or in\r\nthe state itself, are anti-democratic and dangerous.... The construction\r\nof public works tends to engender a race of demagogues, who are sure to\r\nlead the people into debt and difficulty,\" &c. The origin of their name\r\nI have not ascertained.\r\n\r\nAnother party, possessing the equally euphonical name of \"Old Hunkers,\"\r\nare thus described:--\"Standing midway between this wing of the Democracy\r\nand the Whig party, is that portion who have taken upon themselves the\r\ncomfortable title of 'Old Hunkers.' The etymological origin of this\r\nepithet is already lost in obscurity. They embrace a considerable\r\nportion of our citizens who are engaged in banking and other active\r\nbusiness, but at the same time decided lovers of political place and\r\npower. At heart they believe in progress, and are in favour of a liberal\r\nprosecution of works of improvement, but most generally disguise it, in\r\norder to win the Barn-burners' votes. They are by no means deficient\r\nin intelligence or private worth, but are deeply skilled in political\r\ntactics; and their creed, if it is rightly understood, is that public\r\nworks ought to be 'judiciously' prosecuted, provided they themselves can\r\nfill all the offices of profit or honour connected with their\r\nadministration.\"[AZ]\r\n\r\nSuch is the description given of these two parties by the pen of a\r\npolitical opponent, who found in them the greatest obstacles to the\r\nenlargement of the canal.\r\n\r\nThe name of De Witt Clinton will ever be associated with this great and\r\nuseful work, by which the whole commerce of the ocean lakes is poured\r\ninto the Hudson, and thence to the Atlantic. After eight years' hard\r\nstruggle, and the insane but undivided opposition of the city of New\r\nYork, the law for the construction of the canal was passed in the year\r\n1817. One opponent to the undertaking, when the difficulty of supplying\r\nwater was started as an objection, assisted his friend by the\r\nobservation, \"Give yourself no trouble--the tears of our constituents\r\nwill fill it.\" Many others opposed the act on the ground that, by\r\nbringing the produce of the States on the lake shores so easily to New\r\nYork, the property of the State would be depreciated; which appears to\r\nme, in other words, to be--they opposed it on the ground of its utility.\r\nOthers again grounded their objections on the doubt that the revenue\r\nraised by the tolls would be sufficient to justify the expense.\r\nFortunately, however, the act was carried; and in seven years, the\r\ncanal, though not quite completed, was receiving tolls to the amount of\r\nupwards of 50,000l. In 1836 the canal debt was paid, and produce\r\nvalued at 13,000,000l.--of which 10,000,000l. belonged to the State\r\nof New York--was carried through it; the tolls had risen to 320,000l.\r\nper annum, and 80,000l. of that sum was voted to be appropriated to\r\nthe general purposes of the State, the total cost having been under one\r\nand a half million sterling.\r\n\r\nOne might imagine that such triumphant success would have made the State\r\nready to vote any reasonable sum of money to enlarge it if required;\r\nbut the old opponents took the field in force when the proposition was\r\nmade. Even after a certain sum had been granted, and a contract entered\r\ninto, they rescinded the grant and paid a forfeit to the contractor of\r\n15,000l. It was in vain that the injury to commerce, resulting from\r\nthe small dimensions of the canal,[BA] was represented to them; it was\r\nin vain that statistics were laid before them, showing that the\r\n7,000,000 miles traversed by the 4500 canal-boats might, if the proposed\r\nenlargement took place, reduce the distance traversed to two millions of\r\nmiles, and the boats employed to 1500; Barn-burners triumphed, and it\r\nwas decided that the enlargements should only be made out of the surplus\r\nproceeds of the tolls and freight; by which arrangement this vast\r\ncommercial advantage will be delayed for many years, unless the fruits\r\nof the canal increase more rapidly than even their present wonderful\r\nstrides can lead one to anticipate, although amounting at this present\r\nday to upwards of 1,000,000l. yearly.[BB] Such is a short epitome of a\r\ncanal through which, when the Sault St. Marie Channel between Lakes\r\nSuperior and Huron is completed, an unbroken watery highway will bear\r\nthe rich produce of the West from beyond the 90° meridian of longitude\r\nto the Atlantic Ocean.[BC]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Erie is perhaps the canal which bears the most valuable\r\nfreight, it is by no means the greatest undertaking of the kind in the\r\nUnion. The Chesapeake and Ohio canal, uniting Washington and Pittsburg,\r\nhas nearly 400 locks, and is tunnelled four miles through the\r\nAlleghanies; and the Pennsylvania canal, as we have already seen in a\r\nformer chapter, runs to the foot of the same ridge, and being unable to\r\ntunnel, uses boats in compartments, and drags them by stationary engines\r\nacross the mountains. Nothing daunts American energy. If the people are\r\nonce set upon having a canal, go ahead it must; \"can't\" is an unknown\r\nexpression.[BD]\r\n\r\nHowever important the works we have been considering may be to the\r\nUnited States, there can be no doubt that railways are infinitely more\r\nso; I therefore trust the following remarks upon them may have some\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nBy the statement of the last Census, it appears that there are no less\r\nthan 13,266 miles of railroad in operation, and 12,681 in progress,\r\ngiving a total of nearly 26,000 miles; the cost of those which are\r\ncompleted amounts to a little less than 75,000,000l., and the estimate\r\nfor those in progress is a little above 44,000,000l. We thus see that\r\nthe United States will possess 26,000 miles of railroad, at the cost of\r\nabout 120,000,000l. In England we have 8068 miles of railway, and the\r\ncost of these amounts to 273,860,000l., or at the rate of 34,020l.\r\nper mile. This extraordinary difference between the results produced and\r\nthe expenses incurred requires some little explanation. By the Census\r\nreport, I learn that the average expense of the railways varies in\r\ndifferent parts of the Union; those in the northern, or New England\r\nStates, costing 9250l. per mile; those in the middle States, 8000l.;\r\nand those in the southern and western States, 4000l. per mile. The\r\nrailway from Charleston to Augusta, on the Savannah River, only cost\r\n1350l. per mile. From the above we see clearly that the expenses of\r\ntheir railways are materially affected by density of population and the\r\nconsequent value of land, by the comparative absence of forest to supply\r\nmaterial, and by the value of labour. If these three causes produce such\r\nmaterial differences in a country comparatively unoccupied like the\r\nUnited States, it is but natural to expect that they should be felt with\r\ninfinitely more force in England. Moreover, as it has been well observed\r\nby Captain D. Galton, R.E.,[BE] \"railways originated in England, and\r\ntherefore the experience which is always required to perfect a new\r\nsystem has been chiefly acquired in this country, and has increased the\r\ncost of our own railways for the benefit of our neighbours.\"--Some\r\nconception may be formed of the irregular nature of the expense on the\r\nlines in England from the statement subjoined, also taken from the same\r\npaper, viz.:--\r\n\r\n  Name of Railway.  Land and                               Total Cost\r\n                    Compensation.      Works.    Rails.     per Mile.\r\n                         £               £          £             £\r\n\r\n  London       }\r\n  and          }      113,500          98,000     1,000   253,000[BF]\r\n  Blackwall    }\r\n\r\n  Leicester    }\r\n  and          }        1,000           5,700       700     8,700[BF]\r\n  Swannington  }\r\n\r\nFrom the table on the opposite page, it will be seen that the cost of\r\nconstruction and engineering expenses amounted to 35,526,535l. out of\r\n45,051,217l. Taking the railways quoted as representing a fair average\r\nof the whole, we ascertain that more than one-fourth of the expense of\r\nour railways is incurred for extras comparatively unknown in the United\r\nStates. At a general meeting of the London and North Western, in 1854,\r\nMr. Glyn mentioned as a fact, that a chairman of a certain line, in\r\ngiving evidence, had stated that a competition for the privilege of\r\nmaking 28 miles of railway had cost 250,000l. Such an item of\r\nexpenditure can hardly enter into the cost of a railway in a country as\r\nthinly populated as the Republic. There are also two other important\r\nfacts which are apt to be overlooked: first, that a great portion of the\r\nrailways in the United States are single lines; and secondly, that the\r\nlabour performed is of a far less solid and enduring character. A most\r\ncompetent civil engineer told me that the slovenly and insecure nature\r\nof many of the railway works in the United States was perfectly\r\ninconceivable, and most unquestionably would not stand the inspection\r\nrequired in England. A friend of mine has travelled upon a railway in\r\nAmerica, between Washington and Virginia, of which a great portion was\r\ncomposed of merely a wooden rail with a bar of iron screwed on to the\r\nsurface.[BG] The carriages are also far less expensive and comfortable;\r\na carriage in the United States, which carries fifty people, weighs\r\ntwelve tons, and costs 450l.; in England it may be fairly asserted,\r\nthat for every fifty people in a mixed train there is a carriage weight\r\nof eighteen tons, at a cost of 1500l.\r\n\r\nThe following Table, extracted from a Return moved for by Lord\r\nBrougham, may help to give a better general idea of the reason why our\r\nRailroads have been so costly:--\r\n\r\n  Name of       London &   Great        Midland,  South Eastern  Total\r\n  Railway.

Much remains\r\nfor them to do in the way of organizing the corps of officials, and in\r\nthe erection of proper stations, sufficient at all events, to protect\r\ntravellers from the weather, for which too common neglect the abundance\r\nof wood and their admirable machinery leave them without excuse; not\r\nthat we are without sin ourselves in this last particular. The uncovered\r\nstation at Warrington is a disgrace to the wealthy London and North\r\nWestern Company, and the inconveniences for changing trains at Gretna\r\njunction is even more disreputable; but these form the rare exceptions,\r\nand as a general rule, there cannot be the slightest comparison between\r\nthe admirably arranged corps of railway servants in England, and the\r\nsame class of men in the States; nor between the excellent stations in\r\nthis country, and the wretched counterpart thereof in the Republic.\r\nIncreased intercourse with Europe will, it is to be hoped, gradually\r\nmodify these defects; but as long as they continue the absurd system of\r\nrunning only one class of carriage, the incongruous hustling together of\r\nhumanities must totally prevent the travelling in America being as\r\ncomfortable as that in the Old World.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn from that which carries our bodies at the rate of\r\nforty miles an hour, to that last giant stride of science by which our\r\nwords are carried quick as thought itself--the Telegraph. The Americans\r\nsoon discovered that this invention was calculated to be peculiarly\r\nuseful to them, owing to their enormous extent of territory; and having\r\ncome to this conclusion, their energy soon stretched the electric\r\nmessenger throughout the length and breadth of the land, and by the last\r\nCensus the telegraphic lines extend 16,735 miles, and the length of\r\nwires employed amounts to 23,281. _The Seventh Census_ gives the expense\r\nof construction as 30l. per mile.[BH] The systems in use are Morse's,\r\nHouse's, and Bain's; the two former of American invention, the latter\r\nimported from this country. Of these three the system most generally\r\nemployed is Morse's, the others being only worked upon about 2000 miles\r\neach. It would be out of place to enter into any scientific explanation\r\nof their different methods in these pages; suffice it to say, that all\r\nthree record their messages on ribands of paper; Morse employing a kind\r\nof short-hand symbol which indents the paper; Bain, a set of symbols\r\nwhich by chemical agency discolour the paper instead of indenting it;\r\nand House printing Roman letters in full by the discolouring process.\r\nThose who wish for details and explanations, will find them in the works\r\nof Dr. Lardner and others on the Telegraph.\r\n\r\nThe following anecdote will give some idea of the rapidity with which\r\nthey work. A house in New York expected a synopsis of commercial news by\r\nthe steamer from Liverpool. A swift boat was sent down to wait for the\r\nsteamer at the quarantine ground. Immediately the steamer arrived, the\r\nsynopsis was thrown into the boat, and away she went as fast as oars and\r\nsails could carry her to New York. The news was immediately telegraphed\r\nto New Orleans and its receipt acknowledged back in three hours and five\r\nminutes, and before the steamer that brought it was lashed alongside her\r\nwharf. The distance to New Orleans by telegraph is about 2000 miles. The\r\nmost extensive purchases are frequently made at a thousand miles\r\ndistance by the medium of the telegraph. Some brokers in Wall-street\r\naverage from six to ten messages per day throughout the year. I remember\r\nhearing of a young officer, at Niagara Falls, who, finding himself low\r\nin the purse, telegraphed to New York for credit, and before he had\r\nfinished his breakfast the money was brought to him. Cypher is very\r\ngenerally used for two reasons; first, to obtain the secrecy which is\r\nfrequently essential to commercial affairs; and secondly, that by\r\nwell-organized cypher a few words are sufficient to convey a long\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\nAmong other proposed improvements is one to transmit the signature of\r\nindividuals, maps and plans, and even the outlines of the human face, so\r\nas to aid in the apprehension of rogues, &c. By a table of precedence,\r\nGovernment messages, and messages for the furtherance of justice and\r\ndetection of criminals, are first attended to; then follow notices of\r\ndeath, or calls to a dying bed; after which, is the Press, if the news\r\nbe important; if not, it takes its turn with the general, commercial,\r\nand other news. The wires in America scorn the railway apron-strings in\r\nwhich they are led about in this country. They thread their independent\r\ncourse through forests, along highways and byways, through streets, over\r\nroofs of houses,--everybody welcomes them,--appearance bows down at the\r\nshrine of utility, and in the smallest villages these winged messengers\r\nare seen dropping their communicative wires into the post-office, or\r\ninto some grocer's shop where a 'cute lad picks up all the passing\r\ninformation--which is not in cypher--and probably retails it with an\r\namount of compound interest commensurate with the trouble he has taken\r\nto obtain it. There is no doubt that many of these village stations are\r\nnot sure means of communication, partly perhaps from carelessness, and\r\npartly from the trunk arteries having more important matter to transmit,\r\nand elbowing their weaker neighbours out of the field. Their gradual\r\nincrease is, however, a sufficient proof that the population find them\r\nuseful, despite the disadvantages they labour under. In some instances,\r\nthey have shown a zeal without discretion, for a friend of mine, lately\r\narrived from the Far West, informs me, that in many places the wires may\r\nbe seen broken, and the poles tumbling down for miles and miles\r\ntogether, the use of the telegraph not being sufficient even to pay for\r\nthe keeping up. This fact should be borne in mind when we give them the\r\nfull benefit of the 16,735 miles according to their own statement in\r\n_The Seventh Census_.\r\n\r\nThe very low tariff of charge renders the use of the telegraph universal\r\nthroughout the Union. In Messrs. Whitworth's and Wallis's report, they\r\nmention an instance of a manufacturer in New York, who had his office in\r\none part of the town and his works in an opposite direction, and who, to\r\nkeep up a direct communication between the two, erected a telegraph at\r\nhis own expense, obtaining leave to carry it along over the tops of the\r\nintervening houses without any difficulty. The tariff alluded to above\r\nwill of course vary according to the extent of the useful pressure of\r\ncompetition. I subjoin two of their charges as an example. From\r\nWashington to Baltimore is forty miles, and the charge is 10d. for ten\r\nwords. From New York to New Orleans is two thousand miles, and the\r\ncharge for ten words is ten shillings. It must be remembered that these\r\nten words are exclusive of the names and addresses of the parties\r\nsending and receiving the message.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the telegraph is used in the United States, induced\r\nthose interested in the matter in England to send over for the most\r\ncompetent and practical person that could be obtained, with the view of\r\nascertaining how far any portion of the system employed by them might be\r\nbeneficially introduced into our country. The American system is that of\r\nthe complete circuit, and therefore requiring only one wire; and the\r\npatent of Bain was the one experimented with, as requiring the slightest\r\nintensity of current. After considerable expense incurred in trials, the\r\nAmerican system was found decidedly inferior to our own, solely owing to\r\nthe humidity of our climate, which, after repeated trials, has been\r\nfound to require a far more perfect insulation than is necessary either\r\nin the United States or on the Continent, and therefore requiring a\r\ngreater outlay of capital in bringing the telegraphic wire into a\r\npractical working state; 260 miles is the greatest length that a battery\r\nis equal to working in this country in the worst weather.\r\n\r\nBain's system was formerly not sufficiently perfected to work\r\nsatisfactorily in our climate; recent improvements are removing those\r\nobjections, and the employment of it is now rapidly increasing. The\r\nadvantages that Bain's possesses over Morse's are twofold: first, the\r\nintensity of current required to work it is lighter; and secondly, the\r\ndiscoloration it produces is far more easily read than the indentations\r\nof Morse's. The advantage Morse's possesses over Bain's is, that the\r\nlatter requires damp paper to be always ready for working, which the\r\nformer does not. The advantage Cook and Wheatstone's[BI] possesses over\r\nboth the former is, that it does not demand the same skilled hands to\r\nwind and adjust the machine and prepare the paper; it is always ready at\r\nhand, and only needs attention at long intervals, for which reasons it\r\nis more generally employed at all minor and intermediate stations; its\r\ndisadvantages are, that it does not trace the message, and consequently\r\nleaves no telegraphic record for reference, and it requires two wires,\r\nwhile Bain's or Morse's employs but one; the intensity of the current\r\nrequired to work it is the same as Bain's, and rather less than Morse's.\r\nAll three admit of messages going the whole length of the line being\r\nread at all intermediate stations. The proportion of work capable of\r\nbeing done by Bain's, as compared with Cook and Wheatstone's, is: Bain's\r\nand one wire = 3; Cook and Wheatstone's and two wires = 5. But if Bain's\r\nhad a second wire, a second set of clerks would be requisite to attend\r\nto it. The errors from the tracing telegraph are less than those from\r\nthe magnetic needle; but the difference is very trifling. No extra clerk\r\nis wanted by Cook and Wheatstone's, as all messages are written out by a\r\nmanifold writer. Every message sent by telegraph in England has a\r\nduplicate copy sent by rail to the \"Clearing Office,\" at Lothbury, to be\r\ncompared with the original; thanks to which precaution, clerks keep\r\ntheir eyes open, and the public are efficiently protected from errors.\r\n\r\nHow strange it is, that with the manifest utility of the telegraph in\r\ncase of fire, and the ease with which it could be adapted to that\r\npurpose--as it has now been for some years in Boston--the authorities\r\ntake no steps to obtain its invaluable services. The alarm of fire can\r\nbe transmitted to every district of London at the small cost of 350l.\r\na-year. The most competent parties are ready to undertake the contract;\r\nbut it is too large a sum for a poor little village, with only 2,500,000\r\nof inhabitants, and not losing more than 500,000l. annually by fires,\r\nto expend. The sums spent at St. Stephen's in giving old gentlemen\r\ncolds, and in making those of all ages sneeze from underfoot snuff--in\r\nother words, the attempt at ventilation, which is totally useless--has\r\ncost the country more than would be necessary to supply this vast\r\nmetropolis with telegraphic wire communication for a century.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I must state that in this country several establishments\r\nand individuals have their own private telegraphs, in a similar manner\r\nto that referred to at New York, and many more would do the same, did\r\nnot vested interests interfere.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote AX: _Vide_ observations on this subject in Chapter X.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AY: Extract from lecture delivered by S.B.

I\r\ntherefore propose dedicating a few pages to the subject. The following\r\nTable, arranged from information given in the Census Report of 1850, is\r\nthe latest account within my reach:--\r\n\r\n_Newspapers Published._\r\n\r\n  Daily         Tri-Weekly     Semi-Weekly      Weekly\r\n   254             115             31             1902\r\n\r\n  Printed        Printed        Printed         Printed\r\n  Annually       Annually       Annually        Annually\r\n  235,119,966   11,811,140     5,565,176       153,120,708\r\n\r\n\r\n  Semi-Monthly       Monthly       Quarterly\r\n       95              100             19\r\n\r\n  Printed            Printed         Printed\r\n  Annually           Annually        Annually\r\n  11,703,480         8,887,803       103,500\r\n\r\n_General Classification._\r\n\r\n  Literary and    Neutral and     Political     Religious     Scientific\r\n  Miscellaneous   Independent\r\n  568                 88             1630         191            53\r\n\r\n  Printed          Printed         Printed       Printed        Printed\r\n  Annually         Annually        Annually      Annually       Annually\r\n  77,877,276      88,023,953      221,844,133    33,645,484    4,893,932\r\n\r\nTotal number of newspapers and periodicals, 2526; and copies printed\r\nannually, 426,409,978.\r\n\r\nThe minute accuracy of the number of copies issued annually is a piece\r\nof startling information: the Republic is most famous for statistics,\r\nbut how, without any stamp to test the accuracy of the issues, they have\r\nascertained the units while dealing with hundreds of millions is a\r\nstatistical prodigy that throws the calculating genius of a Babbage and\r\nthe miraculous powers of Herr Döbler and Anderson into the shade. I can\r\ntherefore no more pretend to explain the method they employ for\r\nstatistics, than I can the system adopted by Herr Döbler to mend plates\r\nby firing pistols at them. The exact quantity of reliance that can be\r\nplaced upon them, I must leave to my reader's judgment.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, it may be said that the literary, religious, and\r\nscientific portions of the Press are printed on good paper, and provided\r\nwith useful matter, reflecting credit on the projectors and\r\ncontributors. I wish I could say the same of the political Press; but\r\ntruth compels me to give a far different account of their publications:\r\nthey certainly partake more of the \"cheap and nasty\" style. The paper is\r\ngenerally abominable, the type is so small as to be painful to the eyes,\r\nand would almost lead one to suppose it had been adopted at the\r\nsuggestion of a conclave of 'cute oculists: the style of language in\r\nattacking adversaries is very low: the terms employed are painfully\r\ncoarse, and there is a total absence of dignity; besides which they are\r\nprofuse caterers to the vanity of the nation. I do not say there are no\r\nexceptions; I merely speak generally, and as they came under my own eye,\r\nwhile travelling through the whole length of the States. At the same\r\ntime, in justice, it must be stated, that they contain a great deal of\r\ncommercial information for the very small price they cost, some of them\r\nbeing as low as one halfpenny in price.\r\n\r\nI do not endorse the following extract, nor do I give it as the opinion\r\nwhich editors entertain generally of each other, but rather to show the\r\nlanguage in which adverse opinions are expressed. It is taken from the\r\ncolumns of the _The Liberator_:--\"We have been in the editorial harness\r\nfor more than a quarter of a century, and, during that period, have had\r\nevery facility to ascertain the character of the American Press, in\r\nregard to every form that has struggled for the ascendency during that\r\nperiod; and we soberly aver, as our conviction, that a majority of the\r\nproprietors and editors of public journals more justly deserve a place\r\nin the penitentiaries of the land than the inmates of those places\r\ngenerally. No felons are more lost to shame, no liars are so\r\nunscrupulous, no calumniators are so malignant and satanic.\"--The\r\nlanguage of the foregoing is doubtless unmistakeably clear, but I think\r\nthe style can hardly be thought defensible. On general topics of\r\ninterest, if nothing occurs to stir the writer's bile, or if the theme\r\nbe not calculated to excite the vanity of their countrymen, the language\r\nusually employed is perhaps a little metaphorical, but is at the same\r\ntime grammatical and sufficiently clear; and, I believe, that as a\r\ngeneral principle they expend liberally for information, and\r\nconsequently the whole Republic may be said to be kept well informed on\r\nall passing events of interest.\r\n\r\nIf we turn for a moment from considering the American Press, to take a\r\nslight glimpse at our own, how startling does the difference appear!\r\nGreat Britain, Ireland, and the Channel Islands, with a population\r\nexceeding that of the United States, and with wealth immeasurably\r\ngreater, produce 624 papers, and of these comparatively few are daily;\r\nonly 180 issue above 100,000 copies annually, only 32 circulate above\r\n500,000, and only 12 above 1,000,000. It has further been stated, that\r\nthere are 75 towns returning 115 members, and representing 1,500,000 of\r\nthe population, without any local paper at all.\r\n\r\nThe information respecting the Press in England is derived from _The\r\nSixth Annual Report of the Association for promoting the Repeal of the\r\nTaxes on Knowledge_, and _The Newspaper Press Directory_.

Many are disposed to attribute it, very naturally,\r\nto the Government stamp, and the securities which are required; some, to\r\nthe machinery of Government of this country being necessarily so\r\ncomplicated by ancient rights and privileges, and the difficulties of\r\nraising a revenue, whereof the item of interest on the national debt\r\nalone amounts to nearly 30,000,000l.; while others, again planting one\r\nfoot of the Press compass in London, show that a half circle with a\r\nradius of five hundred miles brings nearly the whole community within\r\ntwenty-four hours' post of the metropolis, in which the best information\r\nand the most able writers are to be found, thereby rendering it\r\nquestionable if local papers, in any numbers, would obtain sufficient\r\ncirculation to enable the editors to retain the services of men of\r\ntalent, or to procure valuable general information, without wholesale\r\nplagiarism from their giant metropolitan rivals. Besides, it must he\r\nremembered that in America, each State, being independent, requires a\r\nseparate press of its own, while the union of all the States renders it\r\nnecessary that the proceedings in each of the others should be known, in\r\norder that the constitutional limits within which they are permitted to\r\nexercise their independence, may be constantly and jealously watched;\r\nfrom which cause it will be seen that there is a very simple reason for\r\nthe Republic requiring comparatively far more papers than this country,\r\nthough by no means accounting for the very great disproportion existing.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, I readily admit that the newspapers of Great Britain\r\nare greatly inferior in numbers, I am bound in justice to add, that they\r\nare decidedly superior in tone and character. I am not defending the\r\nwholesale manner in which, when it suits their purpose, they drag an\r\nunfortunate individual before the public, and crucify him on the\r\nanonymous editorial WE, which is at one and the same time their\r\ndeadliest weapon and their surest shield. Such acts all honest men must\r\nalike deplore and condemn; but it must be admitted that the language\r\nthey employ is more in accordance with the courtesies of civilized life,\r\nthan that used by the Press of the Republic under similar circumstances;\r\nand if, in a time of excitement and hope, they do sometimes cater for\r\nthe vanity of John Bull, they more generally employ their powers to\r\n\"take him down a peg;\" and every newspaper which has sought for\r\npopularity in the muddy waters of scurrility, has--to use an Oriental\r\nproverb--\"eaten its own dirt, and died a putrid death.\"\r\n\r\nLet me now turn from the Press to the literature of the United States.\r\nOf the higher order of publications, it is needless to say anything in\r\nthese pages. Irving, Prescott, Ticknor, Stephens, Longfellow, Hawthorne,\r\nand writers of that stamp, are an honour to any country, and are as well\r\nknown in England as they are in America, consequently any encomium from\r\nmy pen is as unnecessary as it would be presumptuous.\r\n\r\nThe literature on which I propose to comment, is that which I may\r\nreasonably presume to be the popular literature of the masses, because\r\nit is the staple commodity for sale on all railways and steamboats. I\r\nneed not refer again to the most objectionable works, inasmuch as the\r\nvery fact of their being sold by stealth proves that, however numerous\r\ntheir purchasers, they are at all events an outrage on public opinion. I\r\nmade a point of always purchasing whatever books appeared to me to be\r\nselling most freely among my fellow-travellers, and I am sorry to say\r\nthat the mass of trash I thus became possessed of was perfectly\r\ninconceivable, and the most vulgar abuse of this country was decidedly\r\nat a premium. But their language was of itself so penny-a-liny, that\r\nthey might have lain for weeks on the book-shelf at an ordinary\r\nrailway-station in England--price, _gratis_--and nobody but a trunkmaker\r\nor a grocer would have been at the trouble of removing them.\r\n\r\nNot content, however, with writing trash, they do not scruple to\r\ndeceive the public in the most barefaced way by deliberate falsehood. I\r\nhave in my possession two of these specimens of honesty, purchased\r\nsolely from seeing my brother's name as the author, which of course I\r\nknew perfectly well to be false, and which they doubtless put there\r\nbecause the American public had received favourably the volumes he\r\nreally had written. Of the contents of these works attributed to him I\r\nwill only say, the rubbish was worthy of the robber. I would not convey\r\nthe idea that all the books offered for sale are of this calibre; there\r\nare also magazines and other works, some of which are both interesting\r\nand well-written. If I found no quick sale going on, I generally\r\nselected some work treating of either England or the English, so as to\r\nascertain the popular shape in which my countrymen were represented.\r\n\r\nOne work which I got hold of, called _Northwood_, amused me much: I\r\nthere found the Englishman living under a belief that the Americans were\r\nlittle better than savages and Pagans, and quite overcome at the\r\nextraordinary scene of a household meeting together for domestic\r\nworship, which of course was never heard of in England. This little\r\nscene affords a charming opportunity for \"buttering up\" New England\r\npiety at the cheap expense of a libel upon the old country. He then is\r\ntaken to hear a sermon, where for his special benefit, I suppose, the\r\npreacher expatiates on the glorious field of Bunker's Hill, foretells\r\nEngland's decline, and generously promises our countrymen a home in\r\nAmerica when they are quite \"used up.\" The Englishman is quite overcome\r\nwith the eloquence and sympathy of the Church militant preacher, whose\r\ndiscourse being composed by the authoress, I may fairly conclude is\r\ngiven as a model of New England oratory in her estimation. Justice\r\nrequires I should add, that the sermons I heard during my stay in those\r\nStates were on religious topics, and not on revolutionary war.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may be said that _Northwood_ was written some years ago, I\r\nwill therefore pass from it to what at the present day appears to be\r\nconsidered a _chef d'oeuvre_ among the popular style of works of which I\r\nhave been speaking. I ground my opinion of the high estimation in which\r\nit is held from the flattering encomiums passed upon it by the Press\r\nthroughout the whole Republic from Boston to New Orleans. Boston styles\r\nit a \"_vigorous volume;\"_ Philadelphia, a \"_delightful treat;\"_ New\r\nYork, \"_interesting and instructive;\"_ Albany admires the Author's\r\n\"_keen discriminating powers;\"_ Detroit, \"a _lively and racy style;\" The\r\nChristian Advocate_ styles it \"_a skinning operation\"_ and then adds, it\r\nis a \"_retort courteous\"_ to Uncle Tommyism; Rochester honours the\r\nauthor with the appellation of \"_the most chivalrous American that ever\r\ncrossed the Atlantic.\"_ New Orleans winds up a long paragraph with the\r\nfollowing magnificent burst of editorial eloquence:--\"_The work is\r\nessentially American. It is the type, the representative,_ THE AGGREGATE\r\nOUTBURST OF THE GREAT AMERICAN HEART, _so well expressed, so admirably\r\nrevealing the sentiment of our whole people_--_with the exception of\r\nsome puling lovers he speaks of-_--_that it will find sympathy in the\r\nmind of every true son of the soil.\"_ The work thus heralded over the\r\nRepublic with such perfect _e pluribus unum_ concord is entitled\r\n_English Items;_ and the embodiment of the \"_aggregate outburst of the\r\ngreat American heart\"_ is a Mr. Matthew F. Ward, whose work is sent\r\nforth to the public from one of the most respectable publishers in New\r\nYork--D. Appleton and Co., Broadway.\r\n\r\nBefore I present the reader specimens of ore from this valuable mine I\r\nmust make a few observations. The author is the son of one of the\r\nwealthiest families in Kentucky, a man of education and travel, and has\r\nappeared before the public in a work entitled _The Three Continents:_ I\r\nhave given extracts from the opinions of the Press at greater length\r\nthan I otherwise should have done, because I think after the reader has\r\nfollowed me through a short review of _English Items,_ he will see what\r\nstrong internal testimony they bear to the truth of my previous\r\nobservations. I would also remark that I am not at all thin-skinned as\r\nto travellers giving vent to their true feelings with regard to my own\r\ncountry. All countries have their weaknesses, their follies, and their\r\nwickednesses. Public opinion in England, taken as a whole, is decidedly\r\ngood, and therefore the more the wrong is laid bare the more hope for\r\nits correction; but, while admitting this right in its fullest extent,\r\nit is under two conditions: one that the author speak the truth, the\r\nother that his language be not an outrage on decency or good manners.\r\nNow then, come forth, _thou aggregate outburst of the great American\r\nheart_![BJ] Speak for thyself--let the public be thy judge.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts are from the chapter on \"Our Individual Relations\r\nwith England,\" the chaste style whereof must gratify the reader:--\"I am\r\nsorry to observe that it is becoming more and more the fashion,\r\nespecially among travelled Americans, to pet the British beast; ...\r\ninstead of treating him like other refractory brutes, they\r\npusillanimously strive to soothe him by a forbearance he cannot\r\nappreciate; ... beasts are ruled through fear, not kindness: they\r\nsubmissively lick the hand that wields the lash.\" Then follow\r\ninstructions for his treatment, so terrible as to make future tourists\r\nto America tremble:--\"Seize him fearlessly by the throat, and once\r\nstrangle him into involuntary silence, and the British lion will\r\nhereafter be as fawning as he has been hitherto spiteful.\" He then\r\ninforms his countrymen that the English \"cannot appreciate the retiring\r\nnature of true gentility ... nor can they realize how a nation can fail\r\nto be blustering except from cowardice.\" Towards the conclusion of the\r\nchapter he explains that \"hard blows are the only logic the English\r\nunderstand;\" and then, lest the important fact should be forgotten, he\r\nclothes the sentiment in the following burst of genuine _American_\r\neloquence:--\"To affect their understandings, we must punch their heads.\"\r\nSo much for the chapter on \"Our Individual Relations with England,\"\r\nwhich promise to be of so friendly a nature that future travellers had\r\nbetter take with them a supply of bandages, lint, and diachylon plaster,\r\nso as to be ready for the new _genuine American_ process of intellectual\r\nexpansion.\r\n\r\nAnother chapter is dedicated to \"Sixpenny Miracles in England,\" which is\r\nchiefly composed of _réchauffées_ from our own press, and with which the\r\nreader is probably familiar; but there are some passages sufficiently\r\namusing for quotation:--\"English officials are invariably impertinent,\r\nfrom the policeman at the corner to the minister in Downing-street ...\r\na stranger might suppose them paid to insult, rather than to oblige ...\r\nfrom the clerk at the railway depôt to the secretary of the office where\r\na man is compelled to go about passports, the same laconic rudeness is\r\nobservable.\" How the _American mind_ must have been galled, when a\r\ncabinet minister said, \"not at home\" to a free and enlightened citizen,\r\nwho, on a levee day at the White House, can follow his own\r\nhackney-coachman into the august presence of the President elect.\r\nConceive him strolling up Charing Cross, then suddenly stopping in the\r\nmiddle of the pavement, wrapt in thought as to whether he should cowhide\r\nthe insulting minister, or give him a chance at twenty yards with a\r\nrevolving carbine. Ere the knotty point is settled in his mind, a voice\r\nfrom beneath a hat with an oilskin top sounds in his ear, \"Move on, sir,\r\ndon't stop the pathway!\" Imagine the sensations of a sovereign citizen\r\nof a sovereign state, being subject to such indignities from stipendiary\r\nministers and paid police. Who can wonder that he conceives it the duty\r\nof government so to regulate public offices, &c., \"as to protect not\r\nonly its own subjects, but strangers, from the insults of these\r\nimpertinent hirelings.\" The bile of the author rises with his subject,\r\nand a few pages further on he throws it off in the following beautiful\r\nsentence:--\"Better would it be for the honour of the English nation if\r\nthey had been born in the degradation, as they are endued with the\r\npropensities, of the modern Egyptians.\"\r\n\r\nAt last, among other \"sixpenny miracles,\" he arrives at the Zoological\r\nGardens,--the beauty of arrangement, the grandness of the scale, &c.,\r\nstrike him forcibly; but his keen inquiring mind, and his accurately\r\nrecording pen, have enabled him to afford his countrymen information\r\nwhich most of my co-members in the said Society were previously\r\nunconscious of. He tells them, \"It is under control of the English\r\nGovernment, and subject to the same degradation as Westminster, St.\r\nPaul's, &c.\"--Starting from this basis, which only wants truth to make\r\nit solid, he complains of \"the meanness of reducing the nation to the\r\ncondition of a common showman;\" the trifling mistake of confounding\r\npublic and private property moves his democratic _chivalry_, and he\r\ntakes up the cudgels for the masses. I almost fear to give the sentence\r\npublicity, lest it should shake the Ministry, and be a rallying-point\r\nfor Filibustero Chartists. My anticipation of but a moderate circulation\r\nfor this work must plead my excuse for not withholding it. \"The\r\nGovernment basely use, without permission, the authority of the people's\r\nname, to make them sharers in a disgrace for which they alone are\r\nresponsible. A stranger, in paying his shilling for admission into an\r\nexhibition, which has been dubbed nation (by whom?) in contradistinction\r\nfrom another in the Surrey Gardens, very naturally suspects that the\r\npeople are partners in this contemptible transaction.... The English\r\npeople are compelled to pay for the ignominy with which their despotic\r\nrulers have loaded them.\" Having got his foot into this mare's nest, he\r\nfinds an egg a little further on, which he thus hatches for the American\r\npublic: \"Englishmen not only regard eating as the most inestimable\r\nblessing of life, when they enjoy it themselves, but they are always\r\nintensely delighted to see it going on. The Government charge an extra\r\nshilling at the Zoological Gardens on the days that the animals are fed\r\nin public; but, as much as an Englishman dislikes spending money, the\r\nextraordinary attraction never fails to draw,\" &c.\r\n\r\nFrom the Gardens he visits Chelsea Hospital, where his _keen\r\ndiscriminating powers_ having been sharpened by the demand for a\r\nshilling--the chief object of which demand is to protect the pensioners\r\nfrom perpetual intrusion--he bursts forth in a sublime magnifico\r\nKentuckyo flight of eloquence: \"Sordid barbarians might degrade the\r\nwonderful monuments of their more civilized ancestors by charging\r\nvisitors to see them; but to drag from their lowly retreat these maimed\r\nand shattered victims of national ambition, to be stared at, and\r\nwondered at, like caged beasts, is an outrage against humanity that even\r\nsavages would shrink from.\" And then, a little further on, he makes the\r\nfollowing profound reflection, which no doubt appears to the _American\r\nmind_ peculiarly appropriate to Chelsea Hospital: \"Cringing to the\r\ngreat, obsequious to the high, the dwarfed souls of Englishmen have no\r\nwide extending sympathy for the humble, no soothing pity for the lowly,\"\r\n&c. It would probably astonish some of the readers who have been gulled\r\nby his book, could they but know that the sum paid by Great Britain for\r\nthe support and pension of her veterans by sea and land costs annually\r\nnearly enough to buy, equip, and pay the whole army and navy of the\r\nUnited States.[BK]\r\n\r\nThe next \"sixpenny miracle\" he visits is Chatsworth, which calls forth\r\nthe following _vigorous_ attack on sundry gentlemen, clothed in the\r\nauthor's peculiarly _lively and racy_ language: \"The showy magnificence\r\nof Chatsworth, Blenheim, and the gloomy grandeur of Warwick and Alnwick\r\nCastles, serve to remind us, like the glittering shell of the tortoise,\r\nwhat worthless and insignificant animals often inhabit the most splendid\r\nmansions.\" He follows up this general castigation of the owners of the\r\nabove properties with the infliction of a special cowhiding upon the\r\nDuke of Devonshire, who, he says, \"would, no doubt, be very reluctant\r\nfrankly to confess to the world, that although he had the vanity to\r\naffect liberality, he was too penurious to bear the expense of it. Like\r\nthe ostrich, he sticks his head in the sand, and imagines himself in the\r\nprofoundest concealment.\" He then begs the reader to understand, that he\r\ndoes not mean to intimate \"that any portion of the large amounts\r\ncollected at the doors of Chatsworth actually goes into the pocket of\r\nHis Grace, but they are, nevertheless, remarkably convenient in\r\ndefraying the expense of a large household of servants.... The idea of a\r\nprivate gentleman of wealth and rank deriving a profit from the\r\nexhibition of his grounds must be equally revolting to all classes.\"\r\nThese truthful observations are followed by a description of the\r\ngardens; and the whole is wound up in the following _chivalrous and\r\ngenuine American_ reflection: \"Does it not appear extraordinary that a\r\nman dwelling in a spot of such fairy loveliness should retain and\r\nindulge the most grovelling instincts of human nature's lowest grade?\"\r\nWhat a _delightful treat_ these passages must be to the rowdy\r\nAmericans, and how the Duke must writhe under--what _The Christian\r\nAdvocate_ lauds as--the _skinning operation _of the renowned American\r\nchampion![BL]\r\n\r\nThe Press-bespattered author then proceeds to make some observations on\r\nvarious subjects, in a similar vein of chaste language, lighting at last\r\nupon the system of the sale of army commissions. His vigour is so great\r\nupon this point, that had he only been in the House of Commons when the\r\nsubject was under consideration, his eloquence must have hurled the\r\n\"hireling ministers\" headlong from the government. I can fancy them\r\nsitting pale and trembling as the giant orator thus addressed the House:\r\n\"She speculates in glory as a petty hucksterer does in rancid cheese;\r\nbut the many who hate, and the few who despise England, cannot exult\r\nover her baseness in selling commissions in her own army. There is a\r\ndegree of degradation which changes scorn into pity, and makes us\r\nsincerely sympathize with those whom we most heartily despise.\" The\r\nannexed extract from his observations on English writers on America is\r\nan equally elegant specimen of _genuine American feeling:_--\"When the\r\nability to calumniate is the only power which has survived the gradual\r\nencroachment of bowels upon intellect in Great Britain, it would be a\r\npity to rob the English even of this miserable evidence of mind ... she\r\ngloats over us with that sort of appetizing tenderness which might be\r\nsupposed to have animated a sow that had eaten her nine farrow.\" The\r\nsubjoined sentiment, if it rested with the author to verify, would\r\ndoubtless be true; and I suppose it is the paragraph which earned for\r\nhis work the laudations of _The Christian Advocate:_--\"Mutual enmity is\r\nthe only feeling which can ever exist between the two nations.... She\r\ngave us no assistance in our rise.... She must expect none from us in\r\nher decline.\" How frightful is the contemplation of this omnipotent and\r\n_Christian_ threat! It is worthy of the consideration of my countrymen\r\nwhether they had not better try and bribe the great Matt. Ward to use\r\nhis influence in obtaining them recognition as American territory. The\r\nhonour of being admitted as a sovereign state is too great to be hoped\r\nfor. He has already discovered signs of our decay, and therefore informs\r\nthe reader that \"the weaker rival ever nurses the bitterest hate.\" This\r\ninformation is followed by extracts from various English writers\r\ncommenting upon America, at one of whom he gets so indignant, that he\r\nsuggests as an appropriate _American_ translation of the F.R.S. which is\r\nadded to the author's name, \"First Royal Scavenger.\"\r\n\r\nHe then gets into a fever about the remarks made by travellers upon what\r\nthey conceive to be the filthy practice of indiscriminate spitting. He\r\nbecomes quite furious because he has never found any work in which \"an\r\nupstart inlander has ever preached a crusade against the Turks because\r\nthey did not introduce knives and forks at their tables,\" &c. Even\r\nScripture--and this, be it remembered, by the sanction of _The Christian\r\nAdvocate_--is blasphemously quoted to extenuate the American practice of\r\nexpectoration. \"What, after all, is there so unbearably revolting about\r\nspitting? Our Saviour, in one of his early miracles, 'spat upon the\r\nground and made clay of the spittle, and anointed the eyes of the blind\r\nman with the clay. And he said unto him, Go wash in the pool of Siloam.\r\nHe went his way therefore and washed, and came seeing.' I have with a\r\ncrowd of pilgrims gone down to drink from this very pool, for the water\r\nhad borrowed new virtue from the miracle.\" He then states his strong\r\ninclination to learn to chew tobacco in order to show his contempt for\r\nthe opinions of travellers. What a beautiful picture to contemplate--a\r\npopular author with a quid of Virginia before him; Nausea drawing it\r\nback with one hand, and Vengeance bringing it forward with the other!\r\nSuddenly a bright idea strikes him: others may do what he dare not; so\r\nhe makes the following stirring appeal to his countrymen: \"Let us spit\r\nout courageously before the whole world ... let us spit fearlessly and\r\nprofusely. Spitting on ordinary occasions may be regarded by a portion\r\nof my countrymen as a luxury: it becomes a duty in the presence of an\r\nEnglishman. Let us spit around him--above him--beneath him--everywhere\r\nbut on him, that he may become perfectly familiar with the habit in all\r\nits phases. I would make it the first law of hospitality to an\r\nEnglishman, that every tobacco-twist should be called into requisition,\r\nand every spittoon be flooded, in order thoroughly to initiate him into\r\nthe mysteries of chewing. Leave no room for imagination to work. Only\r\nspit him once into a state of friendly familiarity with the barbarous\r\ncustom,\" &c. What a splendid conception!--the population of a whole\r\ncontinent organized under the expectorating banner of the illustrious\r\nMatt. Ward: field-days twice a week; ammunition supplied _gratis;_\r\nliberal prizes to the best marksmen. The imagination is perfectly\r\nbewildered in the contemplation of so majestic an _aggregate outburst of\r\nthe great American_ mouth. I would only suggest that they should gather\r\nround the margin of Lake Superior, lest in their hospitable\r\nentertainment of the \"upstart islanders\" they destroyed the vegetation\r\nof the whole continent.\r\n\r\nIn another chapter he informs his countrymen that the four hundred and\r\nthirty nobles in England speak and act for the nation; his knowledge of\r\nhistory, or his love of truth, ignoring that little community called the\r\nHouse of Commons. Bankers and wealthy men come under the ban of his\r\ncondemnation, as having no time for \"enlightened amusements;\" he then,\r\nwith that truthfulness which makes him so safe a guide to his readers,\r\nadds that \"they were never known to manifest a friendship, except for\r\nthe warehouse cat; they have no time to talk, and never write except on\r\nbusiness; all hours are office-hours to them, except those they devote\r\nto dinner and sleep; they know nothing, they love nothing, and hope for\r\nnothing beyond the four walls of their counting-room; nobody knows them,\r\nnobody loves them; they are too mean to make friends, and too silent to\r\nmake acquaintances,\" &c. What very interesting information this must be\r\nfor Messrs. Baring and their co-fraternity!\r\n\r\nIn another part of this volume, the author becomes suddenly impressed\r\nwith deep reverence for the holy localities of the East, and he falls\r\nfoul of Dr. Clarke for his scepticism on these points, winding up his\r\nremarks in the following beautiful Kentucky vein:--\"A monster so\r\natrocious could only have been a Goth or an Englishman.\" How fortunate\r\nfor his countryman, Dr. Robinson, that he had never heard of his three\r\nlearned tomes on the same subject! though, perhaps, scepticism in an\r\nAmerican, in his discriminating mind, would have been deep erudition\r\ncorrecting the upstart islanders. The great interest which he evinces\r\nfor holy localities--accompanied as it is by an expression of horror at\r\nsome English traveller, who, he asserts, thought that David picked up\r\nhis pebbles in a brook between Jordan and the Dead Sea, whereas he knew\r\nit was in an opposite direction--doubtless earned for him the patronage\r\nof _The Christian Advocate_; and the pious indignation he expresses at\r\nan Englishman telling him he would get a good dinner at Mount Carmel, is\r\na beautiful illustration of his religious feelings.\r\n\r\nThe curious part of this portion of Mr. Ward's book is, that having\r\npreviously informed his countrymen, in every variety of American\r\nphraseology, that the English are composed of every abominable compound\r\nwhich can exist in human nature, he selects them as his companions, and\r\ncourts their friendship to enjoy the pleasure of betraying it. Of\r\ncourse, if one is to judge by former statements made in the volume,\r\nwhich are so palpably and ridiculously false, one may reasonably\r\nconclude that truth is equally disregarded here; but it looks to me\r\nrather as if my countrymen had discovered his cloven hoof, as well as\r\nhis overweening vanity and pretensions, and, when he got pompously\r\nclassical, in his trip through Greece, they amused themselves at his\r\nexpense by suggesting that the Acropolis \"was a capital place for\r\nlunch;\" Parnassus, \"a regular sell;\" Thermopylae, \"great for\r\nwater-cresses.\" Passing on from his companions--one of whom was a fellow\r\nof Oxford, and the other a captain in Her Majesty's service--he becomes\r\ngrandly Byronic, and consequently quite frantic at the idea of Mr. A.\r\nTennyson supplanting him! \"Byron and Tennyson!--what an unholy alliance\r\nof names!--what sinful juxtaposition! He who could seriously compare the\r\ninsipid effusions of Mr. Tennyson with the mighty genius of Byron, might\r\ncommit the sacrilege of likening the tricks of Professor Anderson to the\r\nmiracles of Our Saviour.\"\r\n\r\nHaving delivered himself of this pious burst, he proceeds to a\r\ncastigation of the English for their observations on the nasal twang of\r\nhis countrymen, and also for their criticism upon the sense in which\r\nsundry adjectives are used; and, to show the superior purity of the\r\nAmerican language, he informs the reader that in England \"the most\r\nelegant and refined talk constantly of \"fried 'am\" ... they seem very\r\nreluctant to _h_acknowledge this peculiarly _h_exceptionable 'abit, and\r\n_h_insist that _h_it _h_is confined to the low and _h_ignorant of the\r\ncountry.\" He then gets indignant that we call \"stone\" \"stun,\" and\r\nmeasure the gravity of flesh and blood thereby. \"To unsophisticated\r\nears, 21 stone 6 pounds sounds infinitely less than three hundred\r\npounds, which weight is a fair average of the avoirdupois density of the\r\nSir Tunbelly Clumsies of the middle and upper classes.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this elegant sentence he passes on to the evils of idleness, in\r\ntreating of which he supplies _The Christian Advocate_ with the true\r\ncause of original sin. \"Does any one imagine that the forbidden fruit\r\nwould ever have been tasted if Adam had been daily occupied in tilling\r\nthe earth, and Eve, like a good housewife, in darning fig-leaf aprons\r\nfor herself and her husband? Never!\" The observation would lead one to\r\nimagine that the Bible was a scarce article in Kentucky. He passes on\r\nfrom Adam to the banker and merchant of the present day, and informs the\r\nreader that they command a high respect in society, but it would be\r\ndeemed a shocking misapplication of terms to speak of any of them as\r\ngentlemen. After which truthful statement, he enters into a long\r\ndefinition of a gentleman, as though he thought his countrymen totally\r\nignorant on that point: he gets quite _chivalrous_ in his description:\r\n\"He ought to touch his hat to his opponent with whom he was about to\r\nengage in mortal combat.\"[BM] After which remark he communicates two\r\npieces of information--the one as true as the other is modest:\r\n\"Politeness is deemed lessening to the position of a gentleman in\r\nEngland; in America it is thought his proudest boast.\" Of course he only\r\nalludes to manner; his writings prove at every page that _genuine\r\nAmerican feeling_ dispenses with it in language. His politeness, I\r\nsuppose, may be described in the words Junius applied to\r\nfriendship:--\"The insidious smile upon the cheek should warn you of the\r\ncanker in the heart.\" By way of encouraging civility, he informs the\r\nreader that an Englishman \"never appears so disgusting as when he\r\nattempts to be especially kind; ...in affecting to oblige, he becomes\r\ninsulting.\" He confesses, however, \"I have known others in America whom\r\nyou would never suspect of being Englishmen--they were such good\r\nfellows; but they had been early transplanted from England. If the sound\r\noranges be removed from a barrel in which decay has commenced, they may\r\nbe saved; but if suffered to remain, they are all soon reduced to the\r\nsame disgusting state.\"\r\n\r\nHis discriminating powers next penetrate some of the deep mysteries of\r\nanimal nature: he discovers that the peculiarities of the bullock and\r\nthe sheep have been gradually absorbed into the national character, as\r\nfar as conversation is concerned. \"They have not become woolly, nor do\r\nthey wear horns, but the nobility are eternally bellowing forth the\r\nastounding deeds of their ancestors, whilst the muttonish middle classes\r\nbleat a timorous approval.... Such subjects constitute their fund of\r\namusing small talk,\" &c. From the foregoing elegant description of\r\nconversation, he passes onwards to the subject of gentility, and\r\ndescribes a young honourable, on board a steamer, who refused to shut a\r\nwindow when asked by a sick and suffering lady, telling the husband, \"he\r\ncould not consent to be suffocated though his wife was sick.\" And having\r\ncooked up the story, he gives the following charming reason for his\r\nconduct: \"He dreaded the possibility of compromising his own position\r\nand that of his noble family at home by obliging an ordinary person.\" He\r\nafterwards touches upon English visitors to America, who, he says,\r\n\"generally come among us in the undisguised nakedness of their\r\nvulgarity. Wholly freed from the restraints imposed upon them at home by\r\nthe different grades in society, they indolently luxuriate in the\r\ninherent brutality of their nature. They constantly violate not only all\r\nrules of decorum, but the laws of decency itself.... They abuse our\r\nhospitality, insult our peculiar institutions, set at defiance all the\r\nrefinements of life, and return home, lamenting the social anarchy of\r\nAmerica, and retailing their own indecent conduct as the ordinary\r\ncustoms of the country.... The pranks which, in a backwoods American,\r\nwould be stigmatized as shocking obscenity, become, when perpetrated by\r\na rich Englishman, charming evidence of sportive humour,\" &c.\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of the volume is dedicated to Church matters; for\r\nwhich subject the meek and lowly style which characterizes his writing\r\npre-eminently qualifies him, and to which, doubtless, he is indebted for\r\nthe patronage of _The Christian Advocate_. I shall only indulge the\r\nreader with the following beautiful description of the Established\r\nChurch:--\"It is a bloated, unsightly mass of formalities, hypocrisy,\r\nbigotry, and selfishness, without a single charitable impulse or pious\r\naspiration.\" After this touching display of _genuine American feeling_,\r\nhe draws the picture of a clergyman in language so opposite, that one is\r\nreminded of a certain mysterious personage, usually represented with\r\ncloven feet, and who is said to be very apt at quoting Scripture.\r\n\r\nHeraldry and ancestry succeed the Church in gaining a notice from his\r\npen; and his researches have gone so deep, that one is led to\r\nimagine--despite his declarations of contempt--that he looks forward to\r\nbecoming some day The Most Noble the Duke of Arkansas and Mississippi,\r\nwith a second title of Viscount de' Tucky and Ohio;[BN] the \"de\"\r\nsuggestive of his descent from _The Three Continents_. One of the most\r\nremarkable discoveries he has made, is, that \"the soap-makers and the\r\nbrewers are the compounders of the great staple commodities of\r\nconsumption in Great Britain, and therefore surpass even Charles himself\r\nin the number of their additions to the Peerage.\" This valuable hint\r\nshould not be lost upon those employed in these useful occupations, as\r\nhope is calculated to stimulate zeal and ambition.\r\n\r\nThe last quotations I propose making from this _vigorous volume_ are\r\ntaken from the seventh chapter, headed, \"English Devotion to Dinner.\" On\r\nthis subject the author seems to have had his _keen discriminating\r\npowers_ peculiarly sharpened; and the observations made are in most\r\n_lively and racy style_, and--according to the Press--perfectly\r\n_courteous_. The Englishman \"is never free till armed with a knife and\r\nfork; indeed, he is never completely himself without them[BO] ... which\r\nmay he as properly considered integral portions of an Englishman, as\r\nclaws are of a cat; ... they are not original even in their gluttony;\r\n... they owe to a foreign nation the mean privilege of bestial\r\nindulgence; ... they make a run into Scotland for the sake of oatmeal\r\ncakes, and sojourn amongst the wild beauties of Switzerland in order to\r\nbe convenient to goat's milk.... Like other carnivorous animals, an\r\nEnglishman is always surly over his meals. Morose at all times, he\r\nbecomes unbearably so at that interesting period of the day, when his\r\nsoul appears to cower among plates and dishes; ... though he gorges his\r\nfood with the silent deliberation of the anaconda, yet, in descanting\r\nupon the delicacies of the last capital dinner, he makes an approach to\r\nanimation altogether unusual to him; ... when, upon such auspicious\r\noccasions, he does go off into something like gaiety, there is such\r\nfearful quivering of vast jelly mounds of flesh, something so\r\nsupernaturally tremendous in his efforts, that, like the recoil of an\r\noverloaded musket, he never fails to astound those who happen to be near\r\nhim.\" But his _keen observation_ has discovered a practice before\r\ndinner, which, being introduced into the centre of various censures, may\r\nalso be fairly supposed to be considered by him and his friends of the\r\nPress as most objectionable, and as forming one of the aggregate _Items_\r\nwhich constitute the English beast. \"For dinner, he bathes, rubs, and\r\ndresses.\" How filthy! Yet be not too hard upon him, reader, for this\r\nobservation; I have travelled in his neighbourhood, on the Mississippi\r\nsteamers, and I can, therefore, well understand how the novelty of the\r\noperation must have struck him with astonishment, and how repugnant the\r\npractice must have been to his habits.\r\n\r\nAmong other important facts connected with this great question, his\r\n_discriminating_ mind has ascertained that an Englishman \"makes it a\r\nrule to enjoy a dinner at his own expense as little as possible.\" Armed\r\nwith this important discovery, he lets drive the following American\r\nshell, thus shivering to atoms the whole framework of our society. The\r\nnation may tremble as it reads these withering words of Kentucky\r\neloquence:--\"When it is remembered that of all the vices, avarice is\r\nmost apt to corrupt the heart, and gluttony has the greatest tendency to\r\nbrutalize the mind, it no longer continues surprising that an\r\nEnglishman has become a proverb of meanness from Paris to Jerusalem. The\r\nhatred and contempt of all classes of society as necessarily attend him\r\nin his wanderings as his own shadow.... Equally repulsive to every grade\r\nof society, he stands isolated and alone, a solitary monument of the\r\ndegradation of which human nature is capable.\"\r\n\r\nFeeling that ordinary language is insufficient to convey his _courteous_\r\nand _chivalrous_ sentiments, he ransacks natural history in search of a\r\nsublime metaphor: his triumphant success he records in this beautifully\r\nexpressed sentence--\"The dilating power of the anaconda and the gizzard\r\nof the cassowary are the highest objects of his ambition.\" But neither\r\nordinary language nor metaphor can satisfy his lofty aspirations: it\r\nrequires something higher, it requires an embodiment of _genuine\r\nAmerican feeling, vigorous yet courteous_; his giant intellect rises\r\nequal to the task. He warns my countrymen \"to use expletives oven with\r\nthe danger of being diffuse, rather than be so blunt and so vulgar;\" and\r\nthen--by way, I suppose, of showing them how to be sarcastic without\r\nbeing either blunt or vulgar--he delivers himself of the following\r\nmagnificent bursts:--\"If guts could perform the function of brains,\r\nGreece's seven wise men would cease to be proverbial, for England would\r\npresent to the world twenty-seven millions of sages.... To eat, to\r\ndrink, to look greasy, and to grow fat, appear to constitute, in their\r\nopinion, the career of a worthy British subject.... The lover never asks\r\nhis fair one if she admires Donizetti's compositions, but tenderly\r\ninquires if she loves beef-steak pies. This sordid vice of greediness is\r\nrapidly brutalizing natures not originally spiritual; every other\r\npassion is sinking, oppressed by flabby folds of fat, into helplessness.\r\nAll the mental energies are crushed beneath the oily mass. Sensibility\r\nis smothered in, the feculent steams of roast beef, and delicacy stained\r\nby the waste drippings of porter. The brain is slowly softening into\r\nblubber, and the liver is gradually encroaching upon the heart. All the\r\nnobler impulses of man are yielding to those animal propensities which\r\nmust soon render Englishmen beasts in all save form alone.\"\r\n\r\nI have now finished my _Elegant Extracts_ from the work of Mr. Ward. The\r\nreader can judge for himself of Boston's \"_vigorous volume_,\" of\r\nPhiladelphia's \"_delightful treat_,\" of Rochester's \"_chivalrous and\r\ngenuine Amercan feeling_,\" of The Christian Advocate's \"_retort\r\ncourteous_,\" and of New Orleans' \"_aggregate outburst of the great\r\nAmerican heart_,\" &c. These compliments from the Press derive additional\r\nvalue from the following passage in the work they eulogize. Pages 96,\r\n97, Mr. Ward writes: \"It is the labour of every author so to adapt his\r\nstyle and sentiments to the tastes of his readers, as most probably to\r\nsecure their approbation.... The consciousness that his success is so\r\nwholly dependent on their approval, will make him, without his being\r\naware of it, adapt his ideas to theirs.\" And the New Orleans Press\r\nendorses all the author's sentiments, and insults American gentlemen and\r\nAmerican intelligence, by asserting that it \"_admirably reveals the\r\nsentiments of the whole people, and will find sympathy in the mind of\r\nevery true son of the soil_.\"\r\n\r\nBefore taking a final leave of _English Items_, I owe some apology to\r\nthe reader for the length at which I have quoted from it. My only excuse\r\nis, that I desired to show the grounds upon which I spoke disparagingly\r\nof a portion of the Press, and of the low popular literature of the\r\ncountry. I might have quoted from various works instead of one; but if I\r\nhad done so, it might fairly have been said that I selected an isolated\r\npassage for a particular purpose; or else, had I quoted largely, I might\r\nhave been justly charged with being tedious. Besides which, to\r\ncorroborate my assertions regarding the Press, I should have been bound\r\nto give their opinion also upon each book from which I quoted; and,\r\nbeyond all these reasons, I felt that the generality of the works of low\r\nliterature which I came across were from the pen of people with far less\r\neducation than the author I selected, who, as I have before remarked,\r\nbelongs to one of the wealthiest families in Kentucky, and for whom,\r\nconsequently, neither the want of education nor the want of\r\nopportunities of mixing in respectable society--had he wished to do\r\nso--can be offered as the slightest extenuation.[BP]\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel also that I owe some apology to my American friends for dragging\r\nsuch a work before the public; but I trust they will find sufficient\r\nexcuse for my doing so, in the explanation thus afforded, of the way the\r\nmind of Young America gets poisoned, and which will also partly account\r\nfor the abuse of this country that is continually appearing in their\r\nPress. I feel sure there is hardly a gentleman in America, whose\r\nacquaintance I had the pleasure of making, who would read even the first\r\ntwenty pages of the book; and I am in justice hound to say, that among\r\nall the works of a similar class which I saw, _English Items_ enjoys\r\nunapproachable pre-eminence in misrepresentation and vulgarity, besides\r\nbeing peculiarly contemptible, from the false being mixed up with many\r\ntrue statements of various evils and iniquities still existing in\r\nEngland, and which, being quoted from our own Press, are calculated to\r\ngive the currency of truth to the whole work, among that mass of his\r\ncountrymen who, with all their intelligence, are utterly ignorant of\r\nEngland, either socially or politically.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent career of this censor of English manners and morals is\r\ntoo remarkable to be passed over in silence. I therefore now proceed to\r\ngive you a short epitome of it, as a specimen of morals and manners in\r\nKentucky, as exhibited by him, and his trial. My information is taken\r\nfrom the details of the trial published at full length, a copy of which\r\nI obtained in consequence of the extraordinary accounts of the\r\ntransaction which I read in the papers. Professor Butler had formerly\r\nbeen tutor in the family of the Wards, and was equally esteemed by them\r\nand the public of Louisville generally. At the time of the following\r\noccurrence the Professor was Principal of the High School in that city.\r\n\r\nOne of the boys at the school was William--brother of Mr. Matt. F. Ward:\r\nit appears that in the opinion of the Professor the boy had been guilty\r\nof eating nuts in the school and denying it, for which offence he was\r\ncalled out and whipped, as the master told him, for telling a lie.\r\nWhether the charge or the punishment was just is not a point of any\r\nmoment, though I must say the testimony goes far to justify both.\r\nWilliam goes home, complains to his brother Matt. F., not so much of the\r\nseverity of the punishment, as of being called a liar. The elder brother\r\nbecomes highly indignant, and determines to go to the Professor and\r\ndemand an apology. It must be remembered that the father was all this\r\ntime in Louisville, and of course the natural person to have made any\r\nremonstrance with his old friend the Professor. Matt. F.'s family remind\r\nhim that he is very weakly, and that one of the masters at the school is\r\nan enemy of his. They therefore beg of him to be calm, and to take his\r\nintermediate brother Robert with him, in case of accidents. He consents.\r\nHe then goes to the gun-store of Messrs. Dixon and Gilmore, and\r\npurchases of the latter, about 9 A.M., two small pocket-pistols, three\r\ninches long in the barrel. These he gets Mr. Gilmore to load, but\r\npurchases no further ammunition. After this he proceeds with his brother\r\nRobert, who is armed with a bowie-knife, to the school. Not wishing to\r\nbe unjust to Mr. Matt. F. Ward, I give the statement of the subsequent\r\noccurrence in the words of his brother Robert's evidence in court.[BQ]\r\n\r\n\"On entering the school-room,[BR] Matt. asked for Butler. He came. Matt.\r\nremarked, I wish to have a talk with you. Butler said, Come into my\r\nprivate room. Matt. said, No; here is the place. Mr. Butler nodded.\r\nMatt. said, What are your ideas of justice? Which is the worst, the boy\r\nwho begs chestnuts, and throws the shells on the floor, and lies about\r\nit, or my brother who gives them to him? Mr. Butler said he would not\r\nhe interrogated, putting his pencil in his pocket and buttoning up his\r\ncoat. Matt, repeated the question. Butler said, There is no such boy\r\nhere. Matt. said, That settles the matter: you called my brother a liar,\r\nand for that I must have an apology. Butler said he had no apology to\r\nmake. Is your mind made up? said Matt. Butler said it was. Then, said\r\nMatt., you must hear my opinion of you. You are a d----d scoundrel and\r\na coward. Butler then struck Matt. twice, and pushed him back against\r\nthe door. Matt. drew his pistol and fired. Butler held his hand on him\r\nfor a moment. As the pistol fired, Sturgus[BS] came to the door. I drew\r\nmy knife, and told him to stand back.\" Thus was Professor Butler,\r\nPrincipal of the High School of Louisville, shot by the author of\r\n_English Items_, with a pistol bought and loaded only an hour and a half\r\nprevious, in broad daylight, and in the middle of his scholars. The\r\nProfessor died during the night.\r\n\r\nThe details of the trial are quite unique as to the language employed by\r\njury, counsel, and evidence; but I purposely abstain from making\r\nextracts, though I could easily quote passages sufficiently ridiculous\r\nand amusing, and others which leave a painful impression of the state of\r\nlaw in Kentucky. My reason for abstaining is, that if I quoted at all, I\r\nought to do so at greater length than the limits of a book of travels\r\nwould justify: suffice it that I inform you that Mr. Matthew F. Ward was\r\ntried and acquitted.\r\n\r\nWhen the result of the trial was made known, an indignation meeting was\r\nheld in Louisville, presided over by General Thomas Strange, at which\r\nvarious resolutions were passed unanimously. The first was in the\r\nfollowing terms:--\"Resolved--That the verdict of the jury, recently\r\nrendered in the Hardin County Court, by which Matt. F. Ward was declared\r\ninnocent of any crime in the killing of William H.G. Butler, is in\r\nopposition to all the evidence in the case, contrary to our ideas of\r\npublic justice, and subversive of the fundamental principles of personal\r\nsecurity guaranteed to us by the constitution of the State.\r\n\r\n\"Secondly: Resolved--That the published evidence given on the trial of\r\nMatt. F. Ward shows, beyond all question, that a most estimable citizen,\r\nand a most amiable, moral, and peaceable man has been wantonly and\r\ncruelly killed while in the performance of his regular and responsible\r\nduties as a teacher of youth; and, notwithstanding the verdict of a\r\ncorrupt and venal jury, the deliberate judgment of the heart and\r\nconscience of this community pronounces that killing to be murder.\" The\r\ncommittee appointed by the meeting also requested Mr. Wolfe, one of the\r\ncounsel for the prisoner, to resign his seat in the State Senate, and\r\nthe Honourable Mr. Crittenden, another counsel, to resign his place in\r\nthe Senate of the United States; effigies of the two brothers Ward were\r\nburnt, and a public subscription opened to raise a monument to the\r\nmurdered Professor. I cannot, of course, decide how far the conclusions\r\nof the committee are just, as I do not pretend to know Kentucky law. I\r\nhave, however, given the trial to members of the Bar in this country\r\naccustomed to deal with such cases, and they have without hesitation\r\nasserted that not one man in ten who has been hanged in England has been\r\ncondemned on more conclusive evidence. It is also apparent that in some\r\nparts of the Union the same opinion prevails, as the following paragraph\r\nfrom the _New York Daily Times_ will clearly show:--\"The trial is\r\nremoved from the scene of the homicide, so that the prisoners shall Dot\r\nbe tried by those who knew them best, but is taken to a distant country.\r\nThe Press is forbidden, against all law and right, to publish a report\r\nof the proceedings while the trial is in progress. Every particle of\r\nevidence in regard to Butler's character is excluded; while a perfect\r\narmy of witnesses--clergymen, colonels, members of Congress, editors,\r\ncabinet officers, &c., who had enjoyed the social intimacy of the\r\nWards--testified ostentatiously to the prisoner's mildness of temper,\r\ndeclaring him, with anxious and undisguised exaggeration, to be gentle\r\nand amiable to a fault. All these preparations, laboriously made and\r\nsteadily followed up, were for the purpose, not of determining the\r\ntruth, which is the only proper object of judicial inquiry--not of\r\nascertaining accurately and truly whether Matthew Ward did or did not\r\nmurder Butler--but to secure impunity for his act. This whole drama was\r\nenacted to induce the jury to affirm a falsehood; and it has succeeded.\r\nWe do not believe John J. Crittenden entertains in his heart the shadow\r\nof a doubt that Butler was murdered: we do not believe that a single man\r\non that jury believes that the man they have acquitted is innocent of\r\nthe crime laid to his charge. We regard the issue of this trial as of\r\nthe gravest importance: it proves that in one State of this Union,\r\nwealth is stronger than justice; that Kentucky's most distinguished sons\r\ntake to their hearts and shield with all their power a murderer who has\r\nmoney and social position at his command; and that under their auspices,\r\nlegal tribunals and the most solemn forms of justice have been made to\r\nconfer impunity on one of the blackest and most wanton murders which the\r\nannals of crime record.\"\r\n\r\nI add no comment, leaving the reader to make his own, deductions, and I\r\nonly hope, if the foregoing lines should ever meet the eye of a citizen\r\nbelonging to the sovereign State of Kentucky, they may stir him up to\r\namend the law or to purify the juries.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote BJ: The reader is requested to remember that all the words\r\nprinted in italics--while dealing with _English Items_--are so done to\r\nshow that they are quotations from the eulogies of the American press.\r\nThey are as thoroughly repudiated by me as they must be by every\r\nAmerican gentleman.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BK: Did Mr. Ward ever read any account in the gazettes of his\r\nown country, of the poor soldiers going to \"Washington to procure land\r\nwarrants, and after being detained there till they were reduced to\r\nbeggary, receiving no attention? Let me commend the following letter,\r\ntaken from the press of his own country, dated July 6, 1853, and\r\naddressed to the President:--\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,--_In the humblest tone do I implore your charity for three\r\ncents, to enable me to procure something to eat._ Pray be so kind, and\r\nreceive the grateful thanks of your humble supplicant of Shenandoah\r\nCounty, Va.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BL: The reader will be astonished to know that these remarks\r\nare from the pen of a Kentucky man; in which State there is a large hole\r\nin the ground, made by Providence, and called \"The Mammoth Cave;\" it is\r\nsituated on private property, and for the privilege of lionizing it, you\r\npay 10s. So carefully is it watched, that no one is even allowed to\r\nmake a plan of it, lest some entrance should be found available on the\r\nadjoining property.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BM: I must beg the reader to remember this last sentence when\r\nhe comes to the interview between the Kentucky author and his old\r\nfriend, the schoolmaster.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BN: Kentucky is the State of his birth and family, Arkansas\r\nthe State of his adoption, and \"The Three Continents\" the fruit of his\r\npen.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BO: The reader will find that, in his interview with the\r\nschoolmaster, his brother was \"completely himself\" with a bowie-knife\r\nonly.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BP: One other instance I must give of the coolness with which\r\nan American writer can pen the most glaring falsehood; _vide_ \"English\r\nTraits,\" by R.W. Emerson. I might quote many fake impressions conveyed,\r\nbut I shall confine myself to one of his observations upon a religious\r\nsubject, where at least decency might have made him respect truth. At\r\npage 126 I find the following sentence:--\"They put up no Socratic\r\nprayer, _much less any saintly prayer, for the Queen's mind_; ask\r\nneither for light nor right, but say bluntly, 'grant her in health and\r\nwealth long to live.'\" Now, I will not ask whether the author of this\r\npassage ever saw our Book of Common Prayer, because printing the words\r\nin inverted commas is proof sufficient; nor will I go out of my way to\r\nshow the _many_ prayers put up for the bestowal of purely spiritual\r\nblessings; but, when I find the previous sentence to the one quoted by\r\nhim to be as follows, \"Endow her plenteously with heavenly gifts,\" what\r\ncan I say of such a writer? Either that by heavenly gifts he understands\r\ndollars and cents, or that he has wilfully sacrificed religious truth at\r\nthe shrine of democratic popularity. Having placed him on these two\r\nhorns of a dilemma, I leave him to arrange his seat.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BQ: Of course the evidence of the brother is the _most\r\nfavourable_ to Mr. M.F.W. that the trial produces.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BR: It appears in evidence that the scene described took place\r\nabout half-past ten A.M.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BS: Mr. Sturgus is the master who was supposed to be\r\nunfriendly to Mr. Matthew F. Ward.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n_The Institution of Slavery._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one subject which no person who pretends to convey to the\r\nreader the honest thoughts and impressions which occupied his mind\r\nduring his travels in this vast Republic, can pass over in silence; and\r\nthat subject, I need scarcely observe, is Slavery. It is an institution\r\nwhich deserves most serious consideration; for while a general unity of\r\nsentiment binds the various States together in a manner that justifies\r\nthe national motto, \"_E pluribus unum_,\" the question of slavery hangs\r\nfearfully over their Union; and the thread by which it is suspended is\r\nmore uncertain than the fragile hair of the sword of Damocles, for it is\r\ndependent upon the angry passions of angry man.\r\n\r\nSo true do I feel this to be, that were I a citizen of one of the Free\r\nStates of America, I might hesitate before I committed my opinions to\r\nthe Press. I trust, however, that I may so treat the subject that no\r\ncause for ill-blood may be given. Unquestionably, the origin of the evil\r\nis wholly with the mother country. We entered into the diabolical\r\ntraffic of our fellow-creatures, and forced the wretched negro upon a\r\nland which had never before received the impress of a slave's foot; and\r\nthis we did despite all the remonstrances of the outraged and indignant\r\ncolonists; and with this revolting sin upon our shoulders, it is but\r\nnatural we should feel deeply interested in the sable ivy-shoot we\r\nplanted, and which now covers the whole southern front of the stately\r\nedifice of the Giant Republic. Time was when a Newcastle collier might\r\nhave carried the sable shoot back to the soil whence it had been stolen;\r\nnow, the keels of many nations combined would scarce suffice to move the\r\nrapid growth.\r\n\r\nBut, while at England's door lies the original guilt, America has since\r\nput the solemn seal of her paternity upon it; every foot of land which,\r\nin the rapid career of her aggrandisement, has been sullied with the\r\nfootsteps of the slave for the first time, mars the beauty of the cap\r\nof liberty, and plants a slave-trader's star in the banner of the\r\nnation. She is only doing a century later what we wickedly did a century\r\nbefore--viz., planting slavery on a soil hitherto free, and enlarging\r\nthe market for the sale of flesh and blood. The futile excuse sometimes\r\noffered, that they were merely moved from one part to another of the\r\nsame country, cannot be admitted; or, if it be, upon the same principle\r\nall the Free States might return again to slavery. If it be no sin to\r\nintroduce slavery into a free Sovereign State, then was England not so\r\nguilty in the first instance, for she sent slaves from a land of\r\nignorance, cruelty, and idolatry, to an enlightened and Christian\r\ncolony. It is in vain for either England or the United States to shirk\r\nthe guilty responsibility of introducing slaves on free soil. England\r\nhas the additional guilt of having acted against the wishes of the\r\ncolonists; the United States has the additional guilt of increasing\r\nslave territory a century later, and when the philanthropists of every\r\ncountry were busied in endeavours to solve the problem, \"How can slavery\r\nbe abolished?\"\r\n\r\nWithout dwelling further upon respective guilt, I will at once proceed\r\nto review the crusades which have been made against the institution, and\r\nthe hopes of the slave under it; after which, I will offer for\r\nconsideration such proposals as appear to me worthy the attention of all\r\nthe true friends of the negro, whether owners or not. While thus\r\ntreating the subject, I beg to observe that I fully recognise each\r\nindividual State as possessing plenipotentiary powers within the limits\r\nof that constitution by which they are all bound together: and I trust\r\nthat, in any observations I may make, no one expression will be so\r\nmisconstrued as to give offence; for I know full well the stupendous\r\ndifficulties with which the whole question is surrounded, and I feel it\r\nis one which should be approached only in a true spirit of charity and\r\nkindness towards the much-maligned gentlemen of the South.\r\n\r\nI open the question by asking--what is the meaning of the cry raised by\r\nthe fanatics of the North--the abolition crusaders? In words, it is\r\nfreedom to the slave; in fact, it is spoliation of their neighbours. Had\r\nthe proposition come from wild Arabs who live in houses they carry on\r\ntheir backs, and feed on the milk of flocks that pasture at their side,\r\nI might have comprehended the modest proposal; but coming from those\r\nwhose energy for business is proverbial, and whose acuteness in all\r\nmatters of dollars and cents is unsurpassed, if equalled, by the\r\nshrewdest Hebrew of the Hebrews, I confess it is beyond my puny\r\nimagination to fathom. Were it accompanied with any pecuniary offer\r\nadequate to the sacrifice proposed, I might be able to comprehend it:\r\nbut for those, or the descendants of those, who, as they found white\r\nlabour more profitable, sold their sable brethren to their southern\r\nneighbours, and thus easily and profitably removed slavery from their\r\nborders,--for those, I say, to turn round and preach a crusade for the\r\nemancipation of the negro, in homilies of contumely, with the voice of\r\nself-righteousness, exhibits a degree of assurance that cannot be\r\nsurpassed. Had they known as much of human nature as of the laws of\r\nprofit and loss, they might have foreseen that in every epithet heaped\r\nupon their southern countrymen, they were riveting a fresh bolt in the\r\nslave's fetters. On what plea did the American colony rebel? Was it not,\r\nas a broad principle, the right of self-government? Does not their\r\nconstitution allow independent action to each State, subject only to\r\ncertain obligations, binding alike on all? If those are complied with,\r\non what principle of patriotism or honour do individuals or societies\r\nhurl torches of discord among their southern co-citizens?\r\n\r\nNo person who has watched or inquired into the social state of the\r\nslaves during the present century, can fail to have observed that much\r\nhas been done to improve their condition among the respectable holders\r\nthereof, both as regards common education and religious instruction; at\r\nthe same time, they will perceive that the first law of\r\nnature--self-preservation--compelled them to make common education\r\npenal, as soon as fanatical abolitionists inundated the country with\r\nfirebrand pamphlets. No American can deny, that when an oppressed people\r\nfeel their chains galling to them, they have a right to follow the\r\nexample of the colonists, and strike for freedom. This right doubtless\r\nbelongs to the negro, and these inflammable publications were calculated\r\nto lead them on to make the effort. But what reflecting mind can fail to\r\nforesee the horrors consequent upon such a hopeless endeavour? More\r\nespecially must it have presented itself to the mind of the\r\nslave-masters; and could they, with sure visions before their eyes of\r\nthe fearful sacrifice of human life, the breaking-up of whatever good\r\nfeeling now exists between master and slave, and the inauguration of a\r\nreign of terror and unmitigated severity--could they, I say, with such\r\nconsequences staring them in the face, have taken a more mild, sensible,\r\nand merciful step than checking that education, through the\r\ninstrumentality of which, the abolitionists were hastening forward so\r\nawful a catastrophe?\r\n\r\nThe following extract may suffice to prove the irritation produced by\r\nthe abolitionists in Virginia, though, of course, I do not pretend to\r\ninsinuate that the respectable portion of the community in that State\r\nwould endorse its barbarous ravings:--\r\n\r\n\"SLAVERY IN THE SCHOOL-ROOM.--The (American) _Richmond Examiner_, in\r\nconnexion with the recent trial of Ward of Kentucky, has the following\r\ntheory on the extinction of schoolmasters in general:--'The South has\r\nfor years been overrun with hordes of illiterate, unprincipled graduates\r\nof the Yankee free schools (those hot-beds of self-conceit and\r\nignorance), who have, by dint of unblushing impudence, established\r\nthemselves as schoolmasters in our midst. So odious are some of these\r\n\"itinerant ignoramuses\" to the people of the South; so full of\r\nabolitionism and concealed incendiarism are many of this class; so full\r\nof guile, fraud, and deceit,--that the deliberate shooting one of them\r\ndown, in the act of poisoning the minds of our slaves or our children,\r\nwe think, if regarded as homicide at all, should always be deemed\r\nperfectly justifiable; and we imagine the propriety of shooting an\r\nabolition schoolmaster, when caught tampering with our slaves, has never\r\nbeen questioned by any intelligent Southern man. This we take to be the\r\nunwritten common law of the South, and we deem it advisable to\r\npromulgate the law, that it may be copied into all the abolition papers,\r\nthundered at by the three thousand New England preachers, and read with\r\npeculiar emphasis, and terrible upturning of eyes, by Garrison, at the\r\nnext meeting of the anti-slavery party at Faneuil Hall. We repeat, that\r\nthe shooting of itinerant abolition schoolmasters is frequently a\r\ncreditable and laudable act, entitling a respectable Southern man to, at\r\nleast, a seat in the Legislature or a place in the Common Council. Let\r\nall Yankee schoolmasters who propose invading the South, endowed with a\r\nstrong nasal twang, a long scriptural name, and Webster's lexicographic\r\nbook of abominations, seek some more congenial land, where their own\r\nlives will be more secure than in the \"vile and homicidal Slave States.\"\r\nWe shall be glad if the ravings of the abolition press about the Ward\r\nacquittal shall have this effect.'\"\r\n\r\nWe now see that the abolitionists have rendered the education of the\r\nnegro, with a view to his ultimate fitness for freedom or\r\nself-government, utterly impracticable, however anxious the slave-owner\r\nmight have otherwise been to instruct him. Thus, by their imprudent\r\nviolence, they have effectually closed the educational pathway to\r\nemancipation. It should not either be forgotten that the Southerners may\r\nhave seen good reason to doubt the Christian sincerity of those who\r\nclamoured so loudly for loosening the fetters of the slaves. The freed\r\nslaves in the Northern States must have frequently been seen by them,\r\nyear after year, as they went for \"the season\" to the watering-places,\r\nand could they observe much in his position there to induce the belief\r\nthat the Northerners are the friends of the negro? In some cities, he\r\nmust not drive a coach or a car; in others, he must not enter a public\r\nconveyance; in places of amusement, he is separated from his white\r\nfriend; even in the house of that God with whom \"there is no respect of\r\npersons,\" he is partitioned off as if he were an unclean animal; in some\r\nStates he is not admitted at all.\r\n\r\nWith such evidences of friendship for the negro, might they not question\r\nthe honesty of Northern champions of emancipation? Could they really\r\nplace confidence in the philanthropic professions of those who treat the\r\nnegro as an outcast, and force on him a life of wretchedness instead of\r\nstriving to raise him in the social scale? If a negro had the intellect\r\nof a Newton--if he were clothed in purple and fine linen, and if he came\r\nfresh from an Oriental bath, and fragrant as \"Araby's spices,\" a\r\nNortherner would prefer sitting down with a pole-cat--he would rather\r\npluck a living coal from the fire than grasp the hand of the worthiest\r\nnegro that ever stepped. Whoever sees a negro in the North smile at the\r\napproach of the white man? Who has not seen a worthy planter or\r\nslave-owner returning from a short absence, greeted with smiles in\r\nabundance, or perhaps receiving a broad grin of pride and pleasure as\r\nthe worthy owner gave his hand to some old faithful slave?\r\n\r\nI think I have shown, in the foregoing remarks, that the Southern has\r\nthree solid and distinct grounds of objection to the Free States\r\nabolitionist. First,--The natural spirit of man, which rebels against\r\nwholesale vituperation and calumny. Secondly,--The obstacle they have\r\nplaced in the way of giving the slave simple education, by introducing\r\nmost inflammable pamphlets. Thirdly,--The questionable sincerity of\r\ntheir professed sympathy for the slave, as evidenced by the antipathy\r\nthey exhibit towards the free negro, and by the palpable fact that he is\r\nfar worse off in a free than in a slave State.\r\n\r\nThe same objection cannot justly be taken against English abolitionists,\r\nbecause they act and think chiefly upon the evidence furnished by\r\nAmerican hands; besides which, slavery in the West Indian colonies was\r\nfelt by the majority of the nation to be so dark a stain upon our\r\nnational character, that, although burdened with a debt such as the\r\nworld never before dreamt of, the sum of 20,000,000l. was readily\r\nvoted for the purposes of emancipation. Whether the method in which the\r\nprovisions of the act were carried out was very wise or painfully\r\nfaulty, we need not stop to inquire: the object was a noble one, and the\r\nsacrifice was worthy of the object.\r\n\r\nWith all the feelings of that discussion fresh in the public mind, it is\r\nno wonder that philanthropists, reading the accounts published by\r\nAmerican authors of the horrors of slavery, should band themselves\r\ntogether for the purpose of urging America in a friendly tone to follow\r\nGreat Britain's noble example, and to profit by any errors she had\r\ncommitted as to the method of carrying emancipation into effect. I am\r\nquite aware a slaveholder may reply, \"This is all very good; but I must\r\nhave a word with you, good gentlemen of England, as to sincerity. If you\r\nhold slavery so damnable a sin, why do you so greedily covet the fruits\r\nof the wages of that sin? The demand of your markets for slave produce\r\nenhances the value of the slave, and in so doing clenches another nail\r\nin the coffin, of his hopes.\" I confess I can give no reply, except the\r\nhumiliating confession which, if the feeling of the nation is to be read\r\nin its Parliamentary acts, amounts to this--\"We have removed slavery\r\nfrom our own soil, and we don't care a farthing if all the rest of the\r\nworld are slaves, provided only we can get cheap cotton and sugar, &c.\r\nMammon! Mammon! Mammon! is ever the presiding deity of the Anglo-Saxon\r\nrace, whether in the Old or the New World.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the reception of Mrs. Beecher Stowe's work\r\nand person in England was very galling to many a Southerner, and\r\nnaturally so; because it conveyed a tacit endorsement of all her\r\nassertions as to the horrors of the slavery system. When I first read\r\n_Uncle Tom_, I said, \"This will rather tend to rivet than to loosen the\r\nfetters of the slave, rousing the indignation of all the South against\r\nher and her associates.\" Everything I have since seen, heard, and read,\r\nonly tends to confirm my original impression. While I would readily give\r\nMrs. Stowe a chaplet of laurel as a clever authoress, I could never\r\naward her a faded leaf as the negro's friend. There can be no doubt that\r\nMrs. Beecher Stowe has had no small share in the abolition excitement\r\nwhich has been raging in the States, and which has made Kansas the\r\nbattle-field of civil war; but the effect of this agitation has gone\r\nfarther: owing to husting speeches and other occurrences, the negro's\r\nmind has been filled with visionary hopes of liberty; insurrections have\r\nbeen planned, and, worse still, insurrections have been imagined. In\r\nfear for life and property, torture worthy of the worst days of the\r\nInquisition has been resorted to, to extort confession from those who\r\nhad nothing to confess. Some died silent martyrs; others, in their\r\nagony, accused falsely the first negro whose name came to their memory;\r\nthus, injustice bred injustice, and it is estimated that not less than a\r\nthousand wretched victims have closed their lives in agony. One white\r\nman, who was found encouraging revolt, and therefore merited punishment\r\nof the severest kind, was sentenced, in that land of equality, to 900\r\nlashes, and died under the infliction--a sight that would have gladdened\r\nthe eyes of Bloody Jeffreys. And why all these horrors? I distinctly\r\nsay,--thanks to the rabid Abolitionists.\r\n\r\nLet me now for a moment touch upon the treatment of slaves. The farms of\r\nthe wealthy planters, and the chapels with negro minister and negro\r\ncongregation, bear bright evidence to the fact that negroes have their\r\nbodily and spiritual wants attended to, not forgetting also the oral\r\nteaching they often receive from the wife of the planter. But is that\r\nsystem universal? Those who would answer that question truthfully need\r\nnot travel to the Southern States for documentary evidence. Is any human\r\nbeing fit to be trusted with absolute power over one of his\r\nfellow-creatures, however deeply his public reputation and his balance\r\nat the banker's may be benefited by the most moderate kindness to them?\r\nIf every man were a Howard or a Wilberforce, and every woman a Fry or a\r\nNightingale, the truth would be ever the same, and they would be the\r\nfirst to acknowledge it.--Man is unfit for irresponsible power.\r\n\r\nNow the only bar before which the proprietor of slaves is likely to be\r\narraigned, is the bar of public opinion; and the influence which that\r\nknowledge will have upon his conduct is exactly in the inverse ratio to\r\nits need; for the hardened brute, upon whom its influence is most\r\nwanted, is the very person who, if he can escape lynching, is\r\nindifferent to public opinion. No Southerner can be affronted, if I say\r\nthat he is not more Christian, kind-hearted, and mild-tempered than his\r\nfellow-man in the Northern States, in France, or in England; and yet how\r\nconstantly do we find citizens of those communities evincing\r\nunrestrained passions in the most brutal acts, and that with the\r\nknowledge that the law is hanging over their heads, and that their\r\nvictims can give evidence against them; whereas, in the Slave States,\r\nprovided the eye of a white man is excluded, there is scarce a limit to\r\nthe torture which a savage monster may inflict upon the helpless slave,\r\nwhose word cannot be received in evidence. It is as absurd to judge of\r\nthe condition of the slave by visiting an amiable planter and his lady,\r\nas it would be to judge of the clothing, feeding, and comfort of our\r\nlabouring population by calling at the town-house of the Duke of\r\nWell-to-do and carefully noting the worthy who fills an arm-chair like a\r\nsentry-box, and is yclept the porter. Look at him, with his hair\r\npowdered and fattened down to the head; behold him as the bell rings,\r\nusing his arms as levers to force his rotundity out of its case; then\r\nobserve the pedestals on which he endeavours to walk; one might imagine\r\nhe had been tapped for the dropsy half-a-dozen times, and that all the\r\nwater had run into the calves of his legs. Is that a type of the poorer\r\nclasses?\r\n\r\nWhere, then, are we to look for true data on which to form an opinion of\r\nthe treatment of the slave?--Simply by studying human nature and\r\nweighing human passions, and then inquiring by what laws they are held\r\nin check. Now, as to the laws, they amount to nothing, inasmuch as slave\r\nevidence is not admissible, and the possibility of any oppression, even\r\nto death itself, must frequently be, without any fear of punishment, in\r\nthe hands of the owner. If law, then, affords the negro no efficient\r\nprotection from human passions, where are we to look for it in human\r\nnature, except it be in the influences of Christianity, self-interest,\r\nor public opinion? The last of these, we have seen, is upon a\r\nsliding-scale of an inefficiency which increases in proportion to the\r\nnecessity for its influence, and is therefore all but impotent for good.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider self-interest. Will any one assert that\r\nself-interest is sufficient to restrain anger? How many a hasty word\r\ndoes man utter, or how many a hasty act does man commit, under the\r\ninfluence of passion he cannot or will not restrain--and that among his\r\nequals, who may be able to resent it, or in the face of law ready to\r\navenge it! How prone are we all, if things go wrong from some fault of\r\nour own, to lose our temper and try to throw the blame on others, rather\r\nthan admit the failure to be our own fault! Without dwelling upon the\r\nserious injury people often do to themselves by unrestrained passion,\r\nthink for a moment of the treatment frequently inflicted upon the poor\r\nanimals over whom they rule absolute. Is not kindness to a horse the\r\ninterest as well as the duty of the owner? and yet how often is he the\r\nunfortunate victim of the owner's rage or cruel disposition, while\r\nfaithfully and willingly expending all his powers in the service of his\r\ntyrant master! If these things be so among equals, or comparative\r\nequals, and also in man's dealings with the lower orders of the\r\ncreation, what chance has the poor slave, with the arm of legislative\r\njustice paralysed, and an arm nerved with human passion his only hope of\r\nmercy?--for self-defence, that first law of nature, is the highest crime\r\nhe can be guilty of: and, while considering the mercenary view of\r\nself-interest, let it not be forgotten that an awful amount of human\r\nsuffering is quite compatible with unimpaired health, and that a slave\r\nmay be frequently under the lash and yet fully able to do his day's\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe last influence we have to consider is indeed the brightest and best\r\nof all--Christianity: high on the brotherly arch of man's duty to his\r\nfellow-man, and forming its enduring keystone, we read, traced by\r\nJehovah in imperishable letters, radiant with love, \"Do unto others as\r\nyou would that they should do unto you;\" \"Love thy neighbour as\r\nthyself.\" Surely it needs no words of mine to show, that a faithful\r\nhistory of the most Christian country in the most Christian times the\r\nworld ever witnessed, would contain, fearful evidence of the cruelty of\r\nman setting at nought the above blessed precept. Nay, more--I question\r\nif, viewed in its entire fulness, there is any one single command in\r\nScripture more habitually disregarded. Proverbs are generally supposed\r\nto be a condensation of facts or experiences. Whence comes \"Every one\r\nfor himself, and God for us all\"? or, the more vulgar one, \"Go ahead,\r\nand the d----l take the hindmost?\" What are they but concentrations of\r\nthe fact that selfishness is man's ruling passion? What are most laws\r\nmade for, but to restrain men by human penalties from a broach of the\r\nlaw of love? and, if these laws be needful in communities, all the\r\nmembers of which are equal in the eyes of the law, and even then be\r\nfound inefficient for their purpose, as may be daily witnessed in every\r\ncountry, who will say that the influence of Christianity is sufficient\r\nprotection to the poor slave?\r\n\r\nThere is only one other influence that I shall mention--that is habit;\r\nit acts for and against the slave. Thus, the kind and good, brought up\r\namong slaves, very often nursed by them, and grown up in the continual\r\npresence of their gentleness and faithfulness, repay them with\r\nunmeasured kindness, and a sympathy in all their sickness and their\r\nsorrows, to a degree which I feel quite certain the most tender-hearted\r\nChristian breathing could never equal, if landed among slaves, for the\r\nfirst time, at years of maturity. The Christian planter's wife or\r\ndaughter may be seen sitting up at night, cooking, nursing, tending an\r\nold sick and helpless slave, with nearly, if not quite, the same\r\naffectionate care she would bestow upon a sick relation, the very\r\nfriendlessness of the negro stimulating the benevolent heart. This is,\r\nindeed, the bright side of the influence of habit.--But the other side\r\nis not less true; and there the effect is, that a coarse, brutal mind,\r\ntrained up among those it can bully with impunity, acquires a\r\nheartlessness and indifference to the negro's wants and sufferings, that\r\ngrow with the wretched possessor's growth. This is the dark side of the\r\ninfluence of habit.\r\n\r\nLet two examples suffice, both of which I have upon the very best\r\nauthority. A faithful slave, having grown up with his master's rising\r\nfamily, obtained his freedom as a reward for his fidelity, and was\r\nentrusted with the management of the property; realizing some money, he\r\nbecame the owner of slaves himself, from among whom he selected his\r\nwife, and to all of whom he showed the greatest consideration. Some\r\ntime after, lying upon his deathbed, he made his will, in which he\r\nbequeathed his wife and all his other negroes to his old master, giving\r\nas his reason, that, from his own lively recollections of his master's\r\nunvarying kindness to himself and the other slaves, he felt certain that\r\nin so doing he was taking the best means in his power of securing their\r\nfuture happiness. What stronger evidence of the growth of kindness in\r\nthe master's heart could possibly be desired? Here, then, is the effect\r\nof habit in a benevolent owner.--Now, turn to the opposite picture. A\r\nlady of New Orleans was accustomed to strip and flog a slave for the\r\npleasure of witnessing sufferings which she endeavoured to render more\r\nacute by rubbing soft soap into the broken skin. Here you have the\r\neffect of habit upon a brutal mind.\r\n\r\nTo the credit of New Orleans be it recorded, that the knowledge of this\r\natrocity having come to white ears, her house was broken open, every\r\narticle it contained pulled out in the street and burnt, and, had she\r\nnot succeeded in eluding search, the she-devil would have been most\r\nassuredly reduced to ashes with her own goods. America became too hot\r\nfor her, and Providence alone knows the demon's cave of concealment.\r\n\r\nHaving thus passed in review the various influences bearing upon the\r\ntreatment of the slave, and seen how utterly inadequate they are to\r\nprotect him from ill-treatment, who can wonder that the tales of real or\r\nsupposed cruelty inflicted upon slaves by the Southerners are received\r\nwith indignation by both parties in the States?--the virtuous and kind\r\nmaster, indignant at the thought of being included in the category of\r\nmonsters, and the real savage, if possible, still more indignant,\r\nbecause his conscience brings home to his seared heart the truthfulness\r\nof the picture, even if it be overdrawn almost to caricature. And here\r\nit is curious to observe the different action of these two parties: the\r\nformer, in the consciousness of a kind heart and a real desire for the\r\nnegro's good, calmly states what has been done and is doing for the\r\nnegro, and throws a natural veil of doubt over horrors so utterly\r\nrepulsive to the feelings that their existence is discredited; the\r\nlatter, with a shallowness which Providence sometimes attaches to guilt,\r\naware that some such accusations come too painfully and truthfully\r\nhome, pronounce their own condemnation by their line of\r\ndefence--recrimination.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, the following extract from an article in a Slave\r\nState paper, entitled \"A Sequel to Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" and in which\r\nQueen Victoria, under the guidance of a \"genius,\" has the condition of\r\nher subjects laid bare before her. After various other paragraphs of a\r\nsimilar nature comes the following:--\r\n\r\n\"The sky was obscured by the smoke of hundreds of small chimneys and\r\nvast edifices, stretching in lines for miles and miles. The latter were\r\ncrowded with women and children, young in years, but withered in form\r\nand feature. The countenances of the men were as colourless as the white\r\nfabric in their looms; their eyes sparkled with intelligence, but it was\r\nchiefly the intelligence of suffering, of privation, of keen sense of\r\nwrong, of inability to be better, of rankling hatred against existing\r\ninstitutions, and a furtive wish that some hideous calamity would bury\r\nthem all in one common, undistinguishable ruin.\r\n\r\n\"'Are these the people? groaned the Queen, as the cold damp of more than\r\nmortal agony moistened her marble forehead.\r\n\r\n\"'Not all of them!\" sounded the voice in her ear, so sharply that her\r\nMajesty looked up eagerly, and saw written, in letters of fire, on the\r\npalace wall:--\r\n\r\n\"'1. Every twelfth person in your dominions is a pauper, daily receiving\r\nparochial relief.\r\n\r\n\"'2. Every twentieth person in your dominions is a destitute wanderer,\r\nwith no roof but the sky--no home but a prison. They are the Ishmaelites\r\nof modern society; every one's hand is against them, and their hands are\r\nagainst every one.\r\n\r\n\"'3. There are in Freeland 10,743,747 females; divide that number by\r\n500,000, and you will find that every twentieth woman in your dominions\r\nis--Oh! horror piled on horror!--a harlot!'\"\r\n\r\nThen follows the scene of a disconsolate female throwing herself over a\r\nbridge, the whole winding up with this charming piece of information,\r\naddressed by the genius to her Majesty:--\r\n\r\n\"In your own land, liberty, the absence of which in another is deplored,\r\nis, in its most god-like development, but a name--unless that may be\r\ntermed liberty which practically is but vulgar license--license to work\r\nfrom rosy morn to dark midnight for the most scanty pittances--license\r\nto store up wealth in the hands and for the benefit of the few--license\r\nto bellow lustily for rival politicians--license to send children to\r\nragged schools--license to sot in the ale-house--license to grow lumpish\r\nand brutal--license to neglect the offices of religion, to swear, to\r\nlie, to blaspheme--license to steal, to pander unchecked to the coarsest\r\nappetites, to fawn and slaver over the little great ones of the\r\nearth--license to creep like a worm through life, or bound through it\r\nlike a wild beast; and, last and most precious of all--for it is\r\nuntaxed--license to starve, to rot, to die, and be buried in a foetid\r\npauper's grave, on which the sweet-smelling flowers, sent to strew the\r\npathway of man and woman with beauty, love, and hope, will refuse to\r\ngrow, much less bloom.\"\r\n\r\nSetting aside all exaggerations, who does not recognise in the foregoing\r\nquotations \"the galled jade wincing\"? Were the writer a kind owner of\r\nslaves, he might have replied to _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ by facts of\r\nhabitual kindness to them, sufficient to prove that the authoress had\r\nentered into the region of romance; but in his recrimination he\r\nunconsciously displays the cloven hoof, and leaves no doubt on the mind\r\nthat he writes under the impulse of a bitterly-accusing monitor within.\r\nIt would be wasting time to point out the difference between a system\r\nwhich binds millions of its people in bondage to their fellow-man, a\r\nmaster's sovereign will their only practical protection, and a system\r\nwhich not only makes all its subjects equal in the eye of the law, and\r\nfree to seek their fortunes wherever they list, but which is for ever\r\nstriving to mitigate the distress that is invariably attendant upon an\r\novercrowded population. Even granting that his assertions were not only\r\ntrue, but that they were entirely produced by tyrannical enactments,\r\nwhat justification would England's sins be for America's crimes? Suppose\r\nthe House of Commons and the Lords Temporal and Spiritual obtained the\r\nroyal sanction to an act for kidnapping boys and grilling them daily for\r\na table-d'hôte in their respective legislative assemblies, would such an\r\natrocity--or any worse atrocity, if such be possible--in any respect\r\nalter the question of right and wrong between master and slave? Let any\r\ncharge of cruelty or injustice in England be advanced on its own simple\r\ngrounds, and, wherever it comes from, it will find plenty of people, I\r\nam proud and happy to say, ready to inquire into it and to work hard for\r\nits removal; but when it comes in the shape of recrimination, who can\r\nfail to recognise an accusing conscience striving to throw the cloak of\r\nother people's sins over the abominations which that conscience is ever\r\nringing in the writer's ears at home.\r\n\r\nI must, however, state that, in speaking of the sufferings or injuries\r\nto which the slave is liable, I am not proclaiming them merely on the\r\nauthority of Northern abolitionists, or on the deductions which I have\r\ndrawn from human nature; many travellers have made similar charges. Miss\r\nBremer writes:--\"I beheld the old slave hunted to death because he dared\r\nto visit his wife--beheld him mangled, beaten, recaptured, fling himself\r\ninto the water of the Black River, over which he was retaken into the\r\npower of his hard master--and the law was silent. I beheld a young woman\r\nstruck, for a hasty word, upon the temples, so that she fell down\r\ndead!--and the law was silent. I heard the law, through its jury,\r\nadjudicate between a white man and a black, and sentence the latter to\r\nbe flogged when the former was guilty--and they who were honest among\r\nthe jurymen in vain opposed the verdict. I beheld here on the shores of\r\nthe Mississippi, only a few months since, a young negro girl fly from\r\nthe maltreatment of her master, and he was a professor of religion, and\r\nfling herself into the river.\"--_Homes of the New World._ Would Miss\r\nBremer write these things for the press, as occurring under her own eye,\r\nif they were not true?\r\n\r\nThen, again, the Press itself in the South bears witness to what every\r\none must admit to be an inhuman practice. How often must the reader of a\r\nSouthern States' paper see children of the tenderest age, sometimes even\r\nunder a year old, advertised for public sale! Did any one every take up\r\nthe New Orleans paper without seeing more than one such advertisement as\r\nthe following?--\r\n\r\n  150 NEGROES FOE SALE.\r\n\r\n  Just arrived, and for sale, at my old stand, No. 7, Moreau-street,\r\n  Third Municipality, one hundred and fifty young and likely NEGROES,\r\n  consisting of field-hands, house servants, and mechanics.

The advertisement is taken from a paper published at Wilmington,\r\nNorth Carolina.\r\n\r\n  $225 REWARD.--STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, NEW HANOVER COUNTY.--_Whereas_,\r\n  complaint upon, oath hath this day been made to us, two of the\r\n  Justices of the Peace for the State and County aforesaid, by BENJAMIN\r\n  HALLET, of the said county, that two certain male slaves belonging to\r\n  him, named LOTT, aged about twenty-two years, five feet four or five\r\n  inches high, and black, formerly belonging to LOTT WILLIAMS, of Onslow\r\n  county; and BOB, aged about sixteen years, five feet high, and black;\r\n  have absented themselves from their said master's service, and are\r\n  supposed to be lurking about this county, committing acts of felony\r\n  and other misdeeds. These are, therefore, in the name of the State\r\n  aforesaid, to command the slaves forthwith to return home to their\r\n  masters; and we do hereby, by virtue of the Act of the General\r\n  Assembly in such cases made and provided, intimate and declare that\r\n  _if the said_ LOTT and BOB _do not return home and surrender\r\n  themselves,_ immediately after the publication of these presents, that\r\n  ANY PERSON MAY KILL AND DESTROY THE SAID SLAVES, by such means as he\r\n  or they may think fit, without accusation or impeachment of any crime\r\n  or offence for so doing, and without incurring any penalty or\r\n  forfeiture thereby.\r\n\r\n  Given under our hands and seals, this 28th day of February, 1853.\r\n\r\n  W.N.

Doubtless some of\r\nthese may be fleeing from the dread of just punishment for offences\r\nagainst the law, but none can doubt that many more are endeavouring to\r\nescape from what they feel to be cruelty, injustice, and oppression.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to pander to a morbid appetite for horrors by gathering\r\ntogether under one view all the various tales of woe and misery which I\r\nhave heard of, known, or seen. I think I have said enough to prove to\r\nany unprejudiced person that such things do and must ever exist under\r\nthe institution of slavery; and that, although the statements of rabid\r\nabolitionists are often the most unwarranted exaggerations, the all but\r\ntotal denial of their occurrence by the slave-owners is also not\r\ncorrect. The conviction forced upon my own mind, after much thought and\r\ninquiry on this most interesting topic is, that there are many dark\r\nclouds of cruelty in a sky which is bright with much of the truest and\r\nkindest sympathy for the poor slave.\r\n\r\nI now propose to take a short review of the progress and real state of\r\nslavery, and I will commence by giving _in extenso_ an enactment which\r\nmaterially affects the negro, and, as I have before observed, has more\r\nthan once threatened the Republic with disunion:--\r\n\r\nSection 2.--Privileges of Citizens.--Clause 3. \"No person held to\r\nservice or labour in one state under the laws thereof, escaping to\r\nanother, shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be\r\ndischarged from such service or labour, but shall be delivered up on\r\nclaim of the party to whom such service or labour may be due.\"\r\n\r\nOf course the word \"slave\" would have read strangely among a community\r\nwho set themselves up as the champions of the \"equal rights of man;\" but\r\nit is clear that, according to this clause in the constitution which\r\nbinds the Republic together, every free state is compelled to assist in\r\nthe recapture of a fugitive slave.\r\n\r\nWhat was the exact number of slaves at the date of this law being passed\r\nI have not the means of ascertaining: at the beginning of this century\r\nit was under 900,000; in the Census of 1850 they had increased to\r\n3,200,000.[BT] There were originally 13 States. At present there are\r\n31, besides territory not yet incorporated into States. The Slave States\r\nare 15, or nearly half. Thus much for increase of slaves and the slave\r\nsoil. But, it will naturally be asked, how did it happen that, as the\r\nadditional soil was incorporated, the sable workmen appeared as if by\r\nmagic? The answer is very simple. The demand regulated the supply, and\r\nslave breeding became a most important feature in the system: thus the\r\nwants of the more southern States became regularly lessened by large\r\ndrafts from Maryland, Kentucky, and Virginia. Anybody desirous of\r\ntesting the truth of this statement will find statistical data to assist\r\nhim in an unpretending volume by Marshall Hall, M.D., &c., _On Twofold\r\nSlavery,_ which I read with much interest, although I cannot agree with\r\nhim in everything.[BV]\r\n\r\nI am aware that residents in these breeding States are to be found who\r\nwould scorn to utter a wilful falsehood, and who deny this propagation\r\nof the human chattel for the flesh market; but there can be little doubt\r\nthat the unbiased seeker after truth will find that such is the case.\r\nAnd why not? Why should those who make their livelihood by trafficking\r\nin the flesh of their fellow-creatures hesitate to increase their\r\nprofits by paying attention to the breeding of them? These facts do not\r\ncome under the general traveller's eye, because, armed with letters of\r\nintroduction, he consorts more with worthy slave-owners, who, occupied\r\nwith the welfare of those around and dependent upon them, know little\r\nof the world beyond; in the same way as in England, a Christian family\r\nmay be an example of patriarchal simplicity and of apostolic zeal and\r\nlove, and yet beyond the circle of their action, though not very far\r\nfrom its circumference, the greatest distress and perhaps cruelty may\r\nabound. How many of the dark spots on our community has the single zeal\r\nof the Earl of Shaftesbury forced upon the public mind, of which we were\r\nutterly ignorant, though living in the midst of them. The degraded\r\nfemale drudge in a coal-pit, the agonized infant in a chimney, and the\r\ndeath-wrought child in a factory--each and all bear testimony to how\r\nmuch of suffering may exist while surrounded by those whose lives are\r\nspent in Christian charity. And so it is in every community, Slave\r\nStates included. Christian hearts, pregnant with zeal and love, are\r\ndiffusing blessings around them; and, occupied with their noble work,\r\nthey know little of the dark places that hang on their borders. The\r\nSouthern planter and his lady may be filled with the love of St. John,\r\nand radiate the beams thereof on every man, woman, and child under their\r\nguardianship, and then, \"measuring other people's corn by their own\r\nlovely bushel,\" they may well hesitate to believe in the existence of a\r\nprofligate breeding Pandemonium within the precincts of their immediate\r\ncountry. Yet, alas! there can be little doubt that it does exist.\r\n\r\nLet us now fix our attention on the actual facts of the case which all\r\nparties admit. First, we have a slave population of 3,200,000. I think,\r\nif I estimate their marketable value at 80_l_ a head, I shall be\r\nconsiderably below the truth. That gives us in human flesh,\r\n250,000,000l. Secondly, let us take the product of their labour. The\r\nSlave States raise annually--\r\n\r\n  Rice             215,000,000 lbs.\r\n  Tobacco          185,000,000  \"\r\n  Sugar            248,000,000  \"\r\n  Cotton         1,000,000,000  \"\r\n  Molasses          12,000,000 gallons.\r\n  Indian Corn.     368,000,000 bushels.\r\n\r\nEstimating these at a lower value than they have ever fallen to, you\r\nhave here represented 80,000,000l. sterling of annual produce from\r\nthe muscle and sinew of the slave.[BW] Surely the wildest enthusiast,\r\ndid he but ponder over these facts, could not fail to pause ere he\r\nmounted the breach, shouting the rabid war-cry of abolition, which\r\ninvolves a capital of 250,000,000_l_, and an annual produce of\r\n80,000,000l.\r\n\r\nThe misery which an instantaneous deliverance of the slave would cause\r\nby the all but certain loss of the greater portion of the products above\r\nenumerated, must be apparent to the least reflecting mind. If any such\r\nschemer exist, he would do well to study the history of our West India\r\nislands from the period of their sudden emancipation, especially since\r\nfree-trade admitted slave produce on equal terms with the produce of\r\nfree labour. Complaints of utter ruin are loud and constant from the\r\nproprietors in nearly every island; they state, and state with truth,\r\nthat it is impossible for free labour at a high price, and which can\r\nonly be got perhaps for six hours a day, to compete with the steady\r\nslave work of twelve hours a day; and they show that slaveholding\r\ncommunities have materially increased their products, which can only\r\nhave been effected by a further taxing of the slave's powers, or a vast\r\nincrease of fresh human material.[BX] But they further complain that the\r\nnegro himself is sadly retrograding. \"They attend less to the\r\ninstruction of their religious teachers; they pay less attention to the\r\neducation of their children; vice and immorality are on the increase,\"\r\n&c.--_Petition to the Imperial Parliament from St. George's, Jamaica,_\r\nJuly, 1852.\r\n\r\nI might multiply such statements from nearly every island, and quote the\r\nauthority of even some of their governors to the same effect; but the\r\nabove are sufficient for my purpose. They prove three most important\r\nfacts for consideration, when treating the question of Slavery. First,\r\nthat you may ruin the planter. Secondly, that you may free--without\r\nbenefiting--the slave. Thirdly, that each State, as it becomes free,\r\ntends to give additional value to the property of those States which\r\nchoose to hold on to slavery; and all these results may occur despite\r\nthe wisdom (?) of senators, and an indemnity of 20,000,000l.\r\n\r\nSurely, then, the Southern planter may well assert that he sees not\r\nsufficient inducement to follow our hasty wholesale example. But while\r\nsuch convictions are forced upon him, he will be a degenerate son of\r\nenergetic sires, if he be so scared at our ill-success as to fear to\r\nlook for some better path to the same noble object; and there is one\r\nmost important consideration which should impel him, while avoiding all\r\nrash haste, to brook no dangerous delay; that consideration is, that the\r\ndifficulty of dealing with the question is increasing with fearful\r\nrapidity, for the slave population has nearly quadrupled itself since\r\nthe beginning of the century. The capital involved is, we have seen,\r\ngigantic; but the question of numbers is by far the most perplexing to\r\ndeal with, in a social point of view. The white population of the Slave\r\nStates is, in rough numbers, 6,000,000; the slave population is more\r\nthan 3,000,000, and the free blacks 250,000. Does any sane man believe\r\nthat, if slavery had existed in Great Britain, and that the slaves had\r\nconstituted one-third of the population, we should have attempted to\r\nremove the black bar from our escutcheon, by the same rapid and summary\r\nprocess which we adopted to free the negro in our colonies?\r\n\r\nAn American writer on Slavery has said, and I think most justly, \"that\r\ntwo distinct races of people, nearly equal in numbers, and unlike in\r\ncolour, manners, habits, feelings and state of civilization to such a\r\ndegree that amalgamation is impossible, cannot dwell together in the\r\nsame community unless the one be in subjection to the other.\" So fully\r\nam I convinced of the truth of this statement, and so certain am I that\r\nevery one who has been in a Slave State must be satisfied of the truth\r\nof it, that I feel sure, if the South freed every slave to-morrow, not a\r\nweek would elapse before each State in the Union without exception would\r\npass stringent laws to prevent them settling within their borders; even\r\nat this moment such a law exists in some States.\r\n\r\nWith all these difficulties constantly before them, who can wonder that\r\na kind-hearted planter, while gazing on the cheerful and happy faces of\r\nhis well-fed and well-housed slaves, should look distrustfully at\r\nemancipation, and strive to justify to his conscience opposition to any\r\nplan, however gradual, which leads thereto. Nevertheless, however\r\nsatisfied in his mind that the slaves are kindly treated, and that\r\nharshness even is never used, he cannot contemplate the institution from\r\na sufficient distance to be beyond its influences, without feeling that\r\nemancipation is the goal towards which his thoughts should ever bend,\r\nand that in proportion as the steps towards it must be gradual, so\r\nshould they speedily commence. But how? Washington, while confessing his\r\nmost earnest desire for abolition, declares his conviction that \"it can\r\nonly be effected by legislative authority.\"\r\n\r\nThe next chapter will detail such propositions as, in my humble opinion,\r\nappear most worthy of the consideration of the Legislature, with a view\r\nto the gradual removal of the black star from the striped banner.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote BT: _List of States and Territories forming the Confederation.\r\nThose marked_ S. _are Slave-holding States._\r\n\r\nSTATES.\r\n\r\n  New Hampshire\r\n  Massachusetts\r\n  Rhode Island\r\n  Connecticut\r\n  New York\r\n  New Jersey[BU]\r\n  Pennsylvania\r\n  S.

The first\r\nproposal is a very old one, and only made by me now, because I consider\r\nit of primary importance--I mean a \"Free-Soil\" bill. I advocate it upon\r\ntwo distinct grounds--the one affecting the Republic, the other the\r\nslave. The Republic sanctions and carries on the slave-trade by\r\nintroducing the institution into land hitherto free, and the slave\r\nthroughout the Union has his fetters tightened by the enhancement of his\r\nvalue; but the great Channing has so fully and ably argued the truth of\r\nthese evils, when treating of the annexation of Texas, that none but the\r\nwilfully blind can fail to be convinced; in short, if Slavery is to be\r\nintroduced into land hitherto free, it is perhaps questionable if it be\r\nnot better to send for the ill-used and degraded slave from Africa, and\r\nleave the more elevated slave in his comparatively happy home in the Old\r\nSlave States; the plea may be used for bettering the condition of the\r\nformer, but that plea cannot be used for the latter.\r\n\r\nThe next proposal is one which, if it came from the South, would, I\r\nsuppose, have the support of all the kind masters in those States, and\r\nmost assuredly would find no opposition in the North,--I mean the\r\nexpulsion from the Constitution of that law by which fugitive slaves are\r\nforced to be given up. If the proposal came from the North, it would\r\nnaturally excite ill-feeling in the South, after all the angry passions\r\nwhich abolition crusading has set in action; but the South might easily\r\npropose it: and when we see the accounts of the affectionate attachment\r\nof the slaves to their masters, and of the kindness with which they are\r\ntreated, in proportion, as such statements are correct, so will it\r\nfollow as a consequence, that none but those who are driven to it by\r\ncruelty will wish to leave their snug homes and families, to seek for\r\npeace in the chilly winters of the North. And surely the slaves who are\r\nvictims of cruelty, every kind-hearted slave-master would rejoice to see\r\nescaping; it would only be the compulsory giving up of fugitives, except\r\nfor criminal offences, which would be expunged; each individual State\r\nwould be able, if desirous, to enter into any mutual arrangement with\r\nany other State, according to their respective necessities. This\r\nproposal has two advantages: one, that it removes a bone of bitter\r\ncontention ever ready to be thrown down between the North and the South;\r\nand the other, that it opens a small loophole for the oppressed to\r\nescape from the oppressor.\r\n\r\nThe next proposal I have to make, is one which, as every year makes it\r\nmore difficult, merits immediate attention,--and that is, the providing\r\na territory of refuge. No one for a moment can doubt that the foundation\r\nof Liberia was an act of truly philanthropic intent, reflecting credit\r\nupon all parties concerned in it; but it must, I fear, be acknowledged\r\nthat it is totally unequal to the object in view. No further evidence of\r\nthis need he adduced, than the simple fact, that, for every negro sent\r\nto Liberia, nearer twenty than ten are born in the States. Dame\r\nPartington's effort to sweep back the incoming tide with a hair-broom\r\npromised better hopes of success; a brigade of energetic firemen would\r\ndrain off Lake Superior in a much shorter space of time than Liberian\r\ncolonization would remove one-third of the slave population. The scheme\r\nis in the right direction, but as insufficient to overcome the\r\ndifficulty as a popgun is to breach a fortified city; the only method of\r\neffectually enabling the system of colonization to be carried out,\r\nis--in my humble opinion--by setting apart some portion of the\r\nunoccupied territory of the Union as a negro colony. In making the\r\nselection, a suitable climate should be considered, in justice to the\r\nhealth of the negro, as it is clear, from the fate of those who fly from\r\npersecution to Canada, that they are unable to resist cold; and\r\nproximity to the ocean is desirable, as affording a cheap conveyance for\r\nthose who become manumitted: the expense of a passage to Liberia is one\r\ngreat obstacle to its utility.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of land required for such a purpose would be very small;\r\nand stringent regulations as to the negro leaving the territory so\r\ngranted, would effectually prevent any inconvenience to the neighbouring\r\nStates. I have before shown that the comparative number of whites and\r\nblacks--whites 6,000,000, and blacks 3,000,000--renders it all but, if\r\nnot quite, impossible for the two races to live together free. I have\r\nalso shown that the Northern States either refuse to admit them, or pass\r\nsuch laws respecting them, that slavery under a good master is a\r\nparadise by comparison. I have further shown that Liberia is, from its\r\ndistance, so expensive for their removal, as to be of but little\r\nassistance, and Canada too often proves an early grave. If, then, these\r\ndifficulties present themselves with a population of 3,000,000 slaves,\r\nand if they are increasing their numbers rapidly--which statistics fully\r\nprove to be the case--it is clear that these difficulties must augment\r\nin a corresponding ratio, until at last they will become insurmountable.\r\nI therefore come to the conclusion, either that territory must be set\r\napart in America itself for the negro's home, or that the black bar of\r\nslavery must deface the escutcheon of the Republic for ever.\r\n\r\nI now propose to make a few remarks on the treatment of slaves. As to\r\nthe nature of that treatment, I have already given my calm and unbiased\r\nopinion. My present observations refer to corporal punishment, and the\r\nimplements for the infliction thereof. Of the latter I have seen four;\r\nof course there may be many others; I speak only of those that have come\r\nunder my own eye. The four I have seen are first, the common\r\nhunting-whip, which is too well known to require description. Secondly,\r\nthe cowhide--its name expresses its substance--when wet, it is rolled up\r\ntightly and allowed to dry, by which process it becomes as hard as the\r\nraw hide commonly seen in this country; its shape is that of a\r\nracing-whip, and its length from four to five feet. Thirdly, the strap,\r\ni.e., a piece off the end of a stiff heavy horse's trace, and about\r\nthree or three-and-a-half feet in length. Fourthly, the paddle; i.e.,\r\na piece of white oak about an inch thick all through, the handle about\r\ntwo inches broad, and rather more than two feet long, the blade about\r\nnine inches long by four and a quarter broad. The two latter implements\r\nI found, upon inquiry, were of modern date, and the reason of their\r\nintroduction was, that the marks of the punishment inflicted thereby\r\nbecame more speedily effaced; and as upon the sale of a slave, if, when\r\nexamined, marks of punishment are clearly developed, his price suffers\r\nfrom the impression of his being obstreperous, the above-named articles\r\nof punishment came into favour.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing observations--without entering into the respective merits\r\nof the four instruments--are sufficient to prove that no one definite\r\nimplement for corporal punishment is established by law, and,\r\nconsequently, that any enactment appointing a limit to the number of\r\nstripes which may he given is an absurdity, however well intended. Forty\r\nstripes, is, I believe, the authorized number. A certain number of\r\nblows, if given with a dog-whip, would inflict no injury beyond the\r\nmomentary pain, whereas the same number inflicted with a heavy\r\nwalking-stick might lame a man for life. Again, I know of no law in the\r\nStates prohibiting the corporal punishment of any slave, of whatever age\r\nor sex; at all events, grown-up girls and mothers of families are doomed\r\nto have their persons exposed to receive its infliction. Of this latter\r\nfact, I am positive, though I cannot say whether the practice is general\r\nor of rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nI have entered rather fully into a description of the implements of\r\npunishment, to show the grounds upon which I make the following\r\nproposals:--First, that a proper instrument for flogging be authorized\r\nby law, and that the employment of any other be severely punished.\r\nSecondly, that the number of lashes a master may inflict, or order to be\r\ninflicted, be reduced to a minimum, and that while a greater number of\r\nlashes are permitted for grave offences, they be only administered on\r\nthe authority of a jury or a given number of magistrates. Thirdly, that\r\ncommon decency be no longer outraged by any girl above fifteen receiving\r\ncorporal punishment.[BZ] Fourthly, that by State enactment--as it now\r\nsometimes is by municipal regulation--no master in any town be permitted\r\nto inflict corporal punishment on a slave above fifteen; those who have\r\npassed that age to be sent to the jail, or some authorized place, to\r\nreceive their punishment, a faithful record whereof, including slave and\r\nowner's names, to be kept. My reasons for this proposal are, that a man\r\nwill frequently punish on the spur of the moment, when a little\r\nreflection would subdue his anger, and save the culprit. Also, that it\r\nis my firm conviction that a great portion of the cruelty of which\r\nslaves are the victims, is caused by half-educated owners of one or two\r\nslaves, who are chiefly to be found in towns, and upon whom such a law\r\nmight operate as a wholesome check. Such a law would doubtless be good\r\nin all cases, but the distances of plantations from towns would render\r\nit impossible to be carried out; and I am sorry to say, I have no\r\nsuggestion to make by which the slaves on plantations might be\r\nprotected, in those cases where the absence of the owners leaves them\r\nentirely at the mercy of the driver, which I believe the cause of by far\r\nthe greatest amount of suffering they endure, though I trust many\r\ndrivers are just and merciful. Fifthly, that the law by which negroes\r\ncan hold slaves should immediately be abolished. The white man holding a\r\nslave is bad enough, but nothing can justify the toleration of the negro\r\nholding his own flesh and blood in fetters, especially when the door of\r\nEducation is hermetically sealed against him.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the foregoing suggestions for the regulation of\r\npunishment, I would propose that any master proved guilty of inflicting\r\nor tolerating gross cruelty upon a slave, should forfeit every slave he\r\nmay possess to the State, and be rendered incapable of again holding\r\nthem, and that copies of such decisions be sent to each county in the\r\nState. In connexion with this subject, there is another point of\r\nconsiderable importance--viz., the testimony of slaves. As matters now\r\nstand, or are likely to stand for some time to come, there appear\r\ninsuperable objections to the testimony of a slave being received on a\r\npar with that of a white man, and this constitutes one of the greatest\r\ndifficulties in enabling the negro to obtain justice for any injury he\r\nmay have sustained. It appears to me, however, that a considerable\r\nportion of this difficulty might he removed by admitting a certain\r\nnumber of slaves--say three--to constitute one witness.\r\nCross-examination would easily detect either combination or falsehood,\r\nand a severe punishment attached to such an offence would act as a\r\npowerful antidote to its commission. Until some system is arranged for\r\nreceiving negro evidence in some shape, he must continue the hopeless\r\nvictim of frequent injustice.\r\n\r\nThe next subject I propose to consider is a legalized system, having\r\nfor its object the freedom of the slave. To accomplish this, I would\r\nsuggest that the State should fix a fair scale of prices, at which the\r\nslave might purchase his freedom, one price for males and another for\r\nfemales under twenty, and a similar arrangement of price between the\r\nages of twenty and fifty, after which age the slave to be free, and\r\nreceive some fixed assistance, either from the State or the master, as\r\nmight be thought most just and expedient. To enable the slave to take\r\nadvantage of the privilege of purchasing his freedom, it would be\r\nrequisite that the State should have banks appointed in which he might\r\ndeposit his savings at fair interest; but to enable him to have\r\nsomething to deposit, it is also requisite that some law should be\r\npassed compelling owners to allow a slave certain portions of time to\r\nwork out for himself, or if preferred, to work for the master, receiving\r\nthe ordinary wages for the time so employed, and this, of course, in\r\naddition to the Sunday. As, however, among so many masters, some will be\r\ncruel and do their utmost to negative any merciful laws which the State\r\nmay enact, I would for the protection of the slave propose that, if he\r\nfeel discontented with the treatment of his master, he be allowed to\r\nclaim the right of being publicly sold, upon giving a certain number of\r\ndays' warning of such desire on his part; or if he can find any\r\nslave-owner who will give the price fixed by law--as before\r\nsuggested--and is willing to take him, his master to be bound to deliver\r\nhim up. With regard to the sale of slaves, I think humanity will justify\r\nme in proposing that no slave under fifteen years of ago be sold or\r\ntransferred to another owner without the parents also; and secondly,\r\nthat husband and wife be never sold or transferred separately, except it\r\nbe by their own consent. However rarely such separations may take place\r\nat present, there is no law to prevent the cruel act, and I have every\r\nreason to believe it takes place much oftener than many of my\r\nkind-hearted plantation friends would he ready to admit.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to the gradual, but ultimately total abolition of\r\nslavery, I would next suggest that, after a certain date--say ten\r\nyears--every slave, upon reaching thirty years of age, be apprenticed by\r\nhis master to some trade or occupation for five years, at the expiration\r\nof which time he be free; after another fixed period--say ten\r\nyears--all slaves above twenty years of age be similarly treated; and\r\nafter a third period, I would propose that the United States should\r\nfollow the noble example long since set them by _Peru_, and make it an\r\nintegral part of their constitution that \"_no one is born a slave in the\r\nRepublic.\"_\r\n\r\nThe next proposal I have to make is one which I cannot but hope that all\r\nAmericans will fell the propriety of, inasmuch as the present system is,\r\nin my estimation, one of the blackest features of the institution we are\r\nconsidering. I allude to the slavery of Americans themselves. In nearly\r\nevery civilized nation in the world, blood is considered to run in the\r\nfather's line, and although illegitimacy forfeits inheritance, it never\r\nforfeits citizenship. How is it in the United States? _There the white\r\nman's offspring is to be seen in fetters--the blood of the free in the\r\nmarket of the slave._ No one can have travelled in the Southern States\r\nwithout having this sad fact forced upon his observation. Over and over\r\nagain have I seen features, dark if you will, but which showed\r\nunmistakeably the white man's share in their parentage. Nay, more--I\r\nhave seen slaves that in Europe would pass for German blondes. Can\r\nanything be imagined more horrible than a free nation trafficking in the\r\nblood of its co-citizens? Is it not a diabolical premium on iniquity,\r\nthat the fruit of sin can be sold for the benefit of the sinner? Though\r\nthe bare idea may well nauseate the kind and benevolent among the\r\nSoutherners, the proof of parentage is stamped by Providence on the\r\nfeatures of the victims, and their slavery is incontrovertible evidence\r\nthat the offspring of Columbia's sons may be sold at human shambles.\r\nEven in Mussulman law, the offspring of the slave girl by her master is\r\ndeclared free; and shall it be said that the followers of Christ are, in\r\nany point of mercy, behind the followers of the false prophet? My\r\nproposition, then, is, that every slave who is not of pure African\r\nblood, and who has reached, or shall reach, the age of thirty, be\r\napprenticed to some trade for five years, and then become free; and that\r\nall who shall subsequently be so born, be free from their birth, and of\r\ncourse, that the mother who is proved thus to have been the victim of\r\nthe white man's passion be manumitted as well as her child.\r\n\r\nI make no proposal about the spiritual instruction of the slave, as I\r\nbelieve that as much is given at present as any legislative enactment\r\nwould be likely to procure; but I have one more suggestion to make, and\r\nit is one without which I fear any number of acts which might be passed\r\nfor the benefit of the slave would lose the greater portion of their\r\nvalue. That suggestion is, the appointment of a sufficient number of\r\nofficers, selected from persons known to be friendly to the slave, to\r\nwhom the duty of seeing the enactments strictly carried out should be\r\ndelegated.\r\n\r\nWhile ruminating on the foregoing pages, a kind of vision passed before\r\nmy mind. I beheld a deputation of Republicans--among whom was one\r\nlady--approaching me. Having stated that they had read my remarks upon\r\nSlavery, I immediately became impressed in their favour, and could not\r\nrefuse the audience they requested. I soon found the deputation\r\nconsisted of people of totally different views, and consequently each\r\naddressed me separately.\r\n\r\nThe first was an old gentleman, and a determined advocate of the\r\ninstitution. He said, \"Your remarks are all bosh; the African race were\r\nborn slaves, and have been so for centuries, and are fit for nothing\r\nelse.\"--I replied, \"I am quite aware of the effect of breeding; we have\r\na race of dog in England which, from their progenitors of many\r\nsuccessive generations having had their tails cut off in puppyhood, now\r\nbreed their species without tails; nay, more--what are all our sporting\r\ndogs, but evidence of the same fact? A pointer puppy stands\r\ninstinctively at game, and a young hound will run a fox; take the\r\ntrouble, for many generations, to teach the hound to point and the\r\npointer to run, and their two instincts will become entirely changed.\r\nThe fact, sir, is that the African having been bred a slave for so many\r\ngenerations is one great cause of his lower order of intellect; breed\r\nhim free and educate him, and you will find the same result in him as in\r\nthe dog.\"--He was about to reply when another of the deputation rose and\r\nreminded him they had agreed to make but one observation each, and to\r\nreceive one answer. I rejoiced at this arrangement, as it saved me\r\ntrouble and gave me the last word.\r\n\r\nA very touchy little slaveholder next addressed me, saying, \"Pray, sir,\r\nwhy can't you leave us alone, and mind your own business?\"--I replied,\r\n\"As for leaving you alone, I am quite ready to do so when you have left\r\nthe negro alone; but as for exclusively attending to my own business,\r\nthat would be far too dull; besides, it is human nature to interfere\r\nwith other people's affairs, and I can't go against nature.\"--He\r\nretired, biting his lip, and as the door closed, I thought I heard the\r\nwords \"Meddling ass!\"--but I wont be sure.\r\n\r\nNext came a swaggering bully of a slave-driver, evidently bred in the\r\nNorth. He said, \"This, sir, is a free country; why mayn't every master\r\nwallop his own nigger?\"--I thought it best to cut him short; so I said,\r\n\"Because, if freedom is perfect, such a permission would involve its\r\nopposite--viz., that every nigger may wallop his own master; and your\r\nantecedents, I guess, might make such a law peculiarly objectionable to\r\nyou personally.\"--He retired, eyeing first me and then his cowhide in a\r\nvery significant manner.\r\n\r\nThe next spokesman was a clerical slaveholder, with a very stiff and\r\nvery white neckcloth, hair straight and long, and a sanctified,\r\nreproof-ful voice. \"Sir,\" said he, \"why endeavour to disturb an\r\ninstitution that Scripture sanctions, and which provides so large a\r\nfield for the ministrations of kindness and sympathy--two of the most\r\ntender Christian virtues?\" A crocodile tear dropped like a full stop to\r\nfinish his sentence. Irascibility and astonishment were struggling\r\nwithin me, when I heard his speech; but memory brought St. Paul to my\r\naid, who reminded me he had before written certain words to the\r\nCorinthian Church--\"Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light;\r\ntherefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed,\"\r\n&e. Thereupon I became calmer, and replied, \"Sir, you are perfectly\r\naware that our Saviour's mission was to the heart of man, and not to the\r\ninstitutions of man. Did He not instruct his subjugated countrymen to\r\npay tribute to Caesar? and did He not set the example in his own person?\r\nDid He not instruct his disciples in the same breath, 'Fear God! honour\r\nthe king?'--and is it not elsewhere written, 'But I say unto you, that\r\nye resist not evil?' You are also perfectly aware that the American\r\ncolonies refused to pay tribute to their Caesar, refused to honour their\r\nking, and did resist the evil. Now, sir, these things being so, you are\r\ncompelled to admit one of two alternatives--either the whole of your\r\ncountrymen are rebels against the Most High, and therefore aliens from\r\nGod, or else, as I before said, the mission of the Gospel is to the\r\nhearts and not to the institutions of man. I see, sir, by the way you\r\nwinced under the term 'rebel,' that you accept the latter alternative.\r\nIf, then, it be addressed to the heart of man, it is through that\r\nchannel--as it becomes enlarged by those virtues of which you spoke,\r\nkindness and sympathy--that human institutions are to become modified to\r\nsuit the growing intelligence and growing wants of the human race, the\r\ngolden rule for man's guidance being, Do as you would be done by. Be\r\nkind enough, sir, to look at Mr. Sambo Caesar working under the lash in\r\na Carolina rice swamp; behold Mrs. Sambo Caesar torn from his bosom, and\r\nworking under the same coercive banner in Maryland; and little Master\r\nPompey, the only pledge of their affections, on his way to Texas. Is not\r\nthis a beautiful comment on the Divine command, 'Love thy neighbour as\r\nthyself?' Permit me, sir, with all due respect, to urge you not to rest\r\nsatisfied with preaching Christian resignation to the slave, and\r\nChristian kindness to the owner, but to seize every opportunity of\r\nfearlessly asserting that slavery is at variance with the spirit of the\r\nGospel, and therefore that it behoves all Christians so to modify and\r\nchange the laws respecting it, as gradually to lead to its total\r\nextinction. Good morning.\"--The reverend gentleman, who during the\r\nlatter part of my observations had buried his hands in the bottom of his\r\ntail pockets, no sooner saw that I had finished my remarks, than he\r\nhastily withdrew his hands, exhibiting in one a Testament, in the other\r\na Concordance; he evidently was rampant for controversy, but the next\r\ndeputy, who thought I had already devoted an unfair proportion of time\r\nto the minister, reminded him of the regulations, and he was obliged to\r\nretire, another deputy opening the door for him, as both his hands were\r\nfull.\r\n\r\nThe deputy who next rose to address me was accompanied by the lady,\r\nwhom, of course, I begged to be seated. The husband--for such he proved\r\nto be--then spoke as follows:--\"Sir, my wife and I have been in\r\npossession of a plantation for nearly twenty years. During all that\r\nperiod the rod has scarcely ever been used, except occasionally to some\r\nturbulent little boy. We have built cottages for our slaves; we allow\r\nthem to breed poultry, which we purchase from them; old slaves are\r\ncarefully nurtured and exempt from labour; the sick have the best of\r\nmedical attendance, and are in many cases ministered to by my wife and\r\ndaughter; the practical truths of Christianity are regularly taught to\r\nthem; and every slave, I am sure, looks upon me and my family as his\r\ntruest friends. This happy state, this patriarchal relationship, your\r\nproposals, if carried out, would completely overthrow.\" He was then\r\nsilent, and his wife bowed an assent to the observations he had made. My\r\nheart was touched with the picture of the little negro paradise which he\r\nhad given, and I replied, as mildly as possible, \"The sketch you have so\r\nadmirably drawn, and every word of which I fully believe, is indeed one\r\nwhich might dispose me to abandon my proposals for change, did any one\r\nwhich I had made interfere with the continuance of your benevolent rule,\r\nas long as slavery exists; but I must call your attention to an\r\nimportant fact which you, I fear, have quite overlooked during your\r\ntwenty years of kind rule. To be brief--the cheerful homes of your happy\r\nnegro families can afford no possible consolation to the less fortunate\r\nnegroes whose wives and children are torn from their bosoms and sold in\r\nseparate lots to different parts of the Union; nor will the knowledge\r\nthat on your plantation the rod only falls occasionally on some\r\nturbulent child, be any comfort to grown-up negroes and negresses while\r\nwrithing under thirty or forty stripes from the cowhide or paddle.\r\nContinue, most excellent people, your present merciful rule; strive to\r\nsecure to every negro the same treatment; and if you find that\r\nimpossible, join the honourable ranks of the temperate and gradual\r\nabolitionist and colonizer.\" They listened patiently to my observations,\r\nsmiled quietly at the vanity which they thought the last sentence\r\nexhibited, and retired.\r\n\r\nScarce had the last charming couple disappeared, when a deputy arose,\r\nthe antipodes of the last speaker; his manner was so arrogant, I\r\ninstantly suspected his ignorance, and his observations showed such\r\npainful sensitiveness, that they were evidently the production of an\r\naccusing conscience. His parentage I could not ascertain accurately;\r\nbut, being a slight judge of horseflesh, I should suspect he was by\r\n\"Slave-bully\" out of \"Kantankerousina,\"--a breed by no means rare in\r\nAmerica, but thought very little of by the knowing ones. On referring to\r\nthe list, I found he was entered as \"Recriminator,\" and that the rest of\r\nthe deputation had refused to give him a warranty. He sprang up with\r\nangry activity; he placed his left hand on his breast, the right hand he\r\nextended with cataleptic rigidity, and with an expression of countenance\r\nwhich I can only compare to that of an injured female of spotless\r\nvirtue, he began, \"You, sir--yes, I say, you, sir--you presume to speak\r\nof the slave--you, sir, who come from a nation of slaves, whose rampant\r\naristocrats feed on the blood of their serfs, where title is another\r\nword for villany, and treads honesty beneath its iron heel! You, sir,\r\nyou offer suggestions for the benefit of a country whose prosperity\r\nexcites your jealousy, and whose institutions arouse mingled feelings of\r\nhatred and fear! Go home, sir--go home! no more of your canting\r\nhypocrisy about the lusty negro! go home, sir, I say! enrich your own\r\npoor, clothe your naked, and feed your own starving--the negro here is\r\nbetter off than most of them! Imitate the example of this free and\r\nenlightened nation, where every citizen is an independent sovereign;\r\nsend your royalty and, aristocracy to all mighty smash, raise the cap of\r\nLiberty on the lofty pole of Democracy, and let the sinews of men obtain\r\ntheir just triumphs over the flimsy rubbish of intellect and capital!\r\nTyranny alone makes differences. All men are equal!\"--He concluded his\r\nharangue just in time to save a fit, for it was given with all the fuss\r\nand fury of a penny theatre King Richard; in fact, I felt at one time\r\nstrongly inclined to call for \"a horse,\" but, having accepted the\r\ndeputation, I was bound to treat its members with courtesy; so I\r\nreplied, \"Sir, your elegantly expressed opinions of royalty, &c.,\r\nrequire nothing but ordinary knowledge to show their absurdity, so I\r\nwill not detain you by dwelling on that subject; but, sir, you\r\nstudiously avoid alluding to the condition of the slave, and, by seeking\r\nfor a fault elsewhere, endeavour to throw a cloak over the subject of\r\nthis meeting. You tell me the poor in England need much clothing and\r\nfood--that is very true; but, sir, if every pauper had a fur cloak and a\r\nround of beef, I cannot see the advantage the negro would derive\r\ntherefrom. Again, sir, you say the negro is better off than many of our\r\npoor; so he is far better off than many of the drunken rowdies of your\r\nown large towns; yet I have never heard it suggested that they should be\r\ntransformed into slaves, by way of bettering their condition. Take my\r\nadvice, sir; before you throw stones, he sure that there is not a pane\r\nof glass in your Cap of Liberty big enough for 3,000,000 of slaves to\r\nlook through. And pray, sir, do not forget, 'Tyranny alone makes\r\ndifferences. All men are equal!'\"\r\n\r\nA slam of the door announced the departure and the temper of\r\nRecriminator, and it also brought upon his feet another deputy who had\r\nkept hitherto quite in the background. He evidently was anxious for a\r\nprivate audience, but that being impossible, he whispered in my ear,\r\n\"Sir, I am an abolitionist, slick straight off; and all I have got to\r\nsay is, that you are a soap-suddy, milk-and-water friend to the slave,\r\nfix it how you will.\" Seeing he was impatient to be off, I whispered to\r\nhim in reply, \"Sir, there is an old prayer that has often been uttered\r\nwith great sincerity, and is probably being so uttered now by more than\r\none intelligent slave: it is this, 'Good Lord, save me from my friends.'\r\nThe exertions of your party, sir, remind me much of those of a man who\r\nwent to pull a friend out of the mud, but, by a zeal without discretion,\r\nhe jumped on his friend's head, and stuck him faster than ever.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he disappeared, I was in hopes it was all over; but a very\r\nmild-tempered looking man, with a broad intelligent forehead, got up,\r\nand, approaching me in the most friendly manner, said, \"Sir, I both\r\nadmit and deplore the evil of the institution you have been discussing,\r\nbut its stupendous difficulties require a much longer residence than\r\nyours has been to fathom them; and until they are fully fathomed, the\r\nremedies proposed must be in many cases very unsuitable, uncalled for,\r\nand insufficient. However, sir, I accept your remarks in the same\r\nfriendly spirit as, I am sure, you have offered them. Permit me, at the\r\nsame time, as one many years your senior, to say that, in considering\r\nyour proposals, I shall separate the chaff--of which there is a good\r\ndeal--from the wheat--of which there is some little; the latter I shall\r\ngather into my mind's garner, and I trust it will fall on good soil.\" I\r\ntook the old gentleman's hand and shook it warmly, and, as he retired, I\r\nmade up my mind he was the sensible slave-owner.\r\n\r\nI was about to leave the scene, quite delighted that the ordeal was\r\nover, when, to my horror, I heard a strong Northern voice calling out\r\nlustily, \"Stranger, I guess I have a word for you.\" On turning round I\r\nbeheld a man with a keen Hebrew eye, an Alleghany ridge nose, and a chin\r\nlike the rounded half of a French roll. I was evidently alone with a\r\n'cute man of dollars and cents. On my fronting him, he said, with\r\nSpartan brevity, \"Who's to pay?\" Conceive, O reader! my consternation at\r\nbeing called upon to explain who was to make compensation for the\r\nsweeping away--to a considerable extent, at all events--of what\r\nrepresented, in human flesh, 250,000,000l., and in the produce of its\r\nlabour 80,000,000l. annually!\r\n\r\nAnswer I must; so, putting on an Exchequery expression, I said, \"Sir, if\r\na national stain is to be washed out, the nation are in honour bound to\r\npay for the soap. England has set you a noble example under similar\r\ncircumstances, and the zeal of the abolitionists will, no doubt, make\r\nthem tax themselves double; but as for suggesting to you by what tax the\r\nmoney is to be raised, you must excuse me, sir. I am a Britisher, and\r\nremembering how skittish you were some years ago about a little stamp\r\nand tea affair, I think I may fairly decline answering your question\r\nmore in detail; a burnt child dreads the fire.\"--The 'cute man\r\ndisappeared and took the vision with him; in its place came the reality\r\nof 2 A.M. and the candles flickering in their sockets.\r\n\r\nReader, I have now done with the question of the gradual improvement and\r\nultimate emancipation of the slave. The public institutions of any\r\ncountry are legitimate subjects of comment for the traveller, and in\r\nproportion as his own countrymen feel an interest in them, so is it\r\nnatural he should comment on them at greater or less length. I have,\r\ntherefore, dwelt at large upon this subject, from the conviction that it\r\nis one in which the deepest interest is felt at home; and I trust that I\r\nhave so treated it as to give no just cause of offence to any one,\r\nwhether English or American.\r\n\r\nI hope I have impressed my own countrymen with some idea of the gigantic\r\nobstacles that present themselves, of which I will but recapitulate\r\nthree;--the enormous pecuniary interests involved; the social difficulty\r\narising from the amount of negro population; and, though last not least,\r\nthe perplexing problem--if Washington's opinion, that \"Slavery can only\r\ncease by legislative authority,\" is received--how Congress can legislate\r\nfor independent and sovereign States beyond the limits of the\r\nConstitution by which they are mutually bound to each other. I feel sure\r\nthat much of the rabid outcry, the ovation of Mrs. B. Stowe, and other\r\nsimilar exhibitions, have arisen from an all but total ignorance of the\r\ntrue facts of the case. This ignorance it has been my object to dispel;\r\nand I unhesitatingly declare that the emancipation of the negroes\r\nthroughout the Southern States, if it took place to-morrow, would be the\r\ngreatest curse the white man could inflict upon them. I also trust that\r\nI may have shadowed forth some useful idea, to assist my Southern\r\nfriends in overtaking a gangrene which lies at their heart's core, and\r\nwhich every reflecting mind must see is eating into their vitals with\r\nfearful rapidity. My last and not my least sincere hope is, that some\r\none among the many suggestions I have offered for the negro's present\r\nbenefit, may be found available to mitigate the undoubted sufferings and\r\ncruel injustice of which those with bad masters must frequently be the\r\nvictims. Should I succeed in even one solitary instance, I shall feel\r\nmore than repaid for the many hours of thought and trouble I have spent\r\nover the intricate problem--the best road from Slavery to Emancipation.\r\n\r\nSince writing the foregoing, 20,000,000 freemen, by the decision of\r\ntheir representatives at Washington, have hung another negro's shackle\r\non their pole of Liberty (?). Kansas is enslaved--freedom is\r\ndishonoured. As a proof how easily those who are brought up under the\r\ninstitution of Slavery blind themselves to the most simple facts, Mr.\r\nBadger, the senator for North Carolina, after eulogizing the treatment\r\nof slaves, and enlarging upon the affection between them and their\r\nmasters, stated that, if Nebraska was not declared a Slave State[CA] it\r\nwould preclude him, should he wish to settle there, from taking with him\r\nhis \"old mammy,\"--the negro woman who had nursed him in infancy. Mr.\r\nWade, from Ohio, replied, \"that the senator was labouring under a\r\nmistake; there was nothing to prevent his taking his beloved mammy\r\nwith him, though Nebraska remained free, except it were that he could\r\nnot sell her when he got there.\"\r\n\r\nLet the Christian learn charity from the despised Mussulman. Read the\r\nfollowing proclamation:--\r\n\r\n  \"From the Servant of God, the Mushir Ahmed Basha Bey, Prince of the\r\n  Tunisian dominions.\r\n\r\n  \"To our ally, Sir Thomas Reade, Consul-General of the British\r\n  Government at Tunis.\r\n\r\n  \"The servitude imposed on a part of the human kind whom God has\r\n  created is a very cruel thing, and our heart shrinks from it.\r\n\r\n  \"It never ceased to be the object of our attention for years past,\r\n  which we employed in adopting such proper means as could bring us to\r\n  its extirpation, as is well known to you. Now, therefore, we have\r\n  thought proper to publish that we have abolished men's slavery in all\r\n  our dominions, inasmuch as we regard all slaves who are on our\r\n  territory as free, and do not recognise the legality of their being\r\n  kept as a property. We have sent the necessary orders to all the\r\n  governors of our Tunisian kingdom, and inform you thereof, in order\r\n  that you may know that all slaves that shall touch our territory, by\r\n  sea or by land, shall become free.\r\n\r\n  \"May you live under the protection of God!\r\n\r\n  \"Written in Moharrem, 1262.\" (23rd of January, 1846.)\r\n\r\nWhat a bitter satire upon the vaunted \"Land of Liberty\" have her sons\r\nenacted since the Mahometan Prince penned the above! Not only has the\r\nslave territory been nearly doubled in the present century; but by a\r\nrecent decision of the Supreme Court, every law which _has been_ passed\r\nby Congress restricting slavery, is pronounced contrary to the\r\nconstitution, and therefore invalid. Congress is declared powerless to\r\nprohibit slavery from any portion of the Federal Territory, or to\r\nauthorize the inhabitants to do so; the African race, whether slave or\r\nfree, are declared not to be citizens, and consequently to be\r\nincompetent to sue in the United States' Courts, and the slave-owner is\r\npronounced authorized to carry his rights into every corner of the\r\nUnion, despite the decrees of Congress or the will of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIn short, in the year 1857, upwards of eighty years after Washington and\r\nhis noble band declared--and at the point of the sword won--their\r\nindependence, and after so many States have purified their shields from\r\nthe negro's blood, the highest tribunal in the Republic has decreed that\r\nthe rights of the slave-owner extend to every inch of the Federal soil,\r\nand that by their Constitution _the United States is a Slave Republic._\r\n\r\nWhat will the end be? A few short years have rolled past since the\r\nforegoing remarks were penned, and in that interval the question of\r\nSlavery has again made the Union tremble to its uttermost borders. The\r\ncloud, not bigger than a man's hand, was sped by President Pierce's\r\nadministration to the new State of Kansas, and ere long it burst in a\r\ndeluge of ruffianism and blood; the halls of Congress were dishonoured\r\nby the violent assault which Mr. Brookes (a Southern senator) made upon\r\nMr. Sumner of Massachusetts; the Press spread far and wide the\r\nignominious fact, that the ladies of his State presented the assailant\r\nwith a cane, inscribed \"Hit him again!\" the State itself endorsed his\r\nact by re-electing him unanimously; North and South are ranged in bitter\r\nhostility; in each large meetings have advocated a separation, in terms\r\nof rancour and enmity; and it is to be feared the Union does not possess\r\na man of sufficient weight and character to spread oil over the troubled\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nHow will \"Manifest Destiny\" unfold itself, and what will the end\r\nbe?--The cup must fill first.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote BY: Many of my suggestions, the reader will observe, are drawn\r\nfrom the Cuba code.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BZ: In Peru, the maximum of stripes the law permits to be\r\ninflicted is twelve; and girls above fourteen, married women, fathers of\r\nchildren, and old men, are exempt from the lash.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote CA: At the time of the discussion, the Nebraska territory\r\nincluded Nebraska and Kansas]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n_Constitution of United States._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important subject that claims the attention of the traveller in\r\nany country that pretends to education or civilization, is undoubtedly\r\nits Constitution. The reader cannot expect--and most probably would not\r\nwish--to find, in a work like this, any elaborate account of the\r\ngovernment of so vast and varied a republic as that of the United\r\nStates. Those who wish thoroughly to grasp so very extensive a topic\r\nmust study the history of each individual State from its foundation;\r\nmust watch the changes each has undergone, noting the effect produced;\r\nand must carefully pore over the writings of the great men who\r\noriginally planned--if I may so express myself--the Republic, and must\r\ndive deep into the learned and valuable tomes of Story, Kent, &c. Those\r\nwho are content with more moderate information, will find a great deal,\r\nvery ably condensed, in a volume by Mr. Tremenheere. To the reader, I\r\npretend to offer nothing but a glance at such elements as appear to me\r\nmost useful and interesting; and in so doing, I shall freely borrow such\r\nquotations from Mr. Tremenheere's references to Story and Kent as I\r\nconceive may help to elucidate my subject, not having those authors at\r\nhand to refer to.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States consists of three departments,--the\r\nExecutive, Legislative, and Judicial; or the President, the House of\r\nRepresentatives and Senate, and the Judicial Courts. The President and\r\nVice-President are chosen by an elective body from all the States, the\r\nsaid body being selected by popular vote in each State. The\r\nVice-President is _ex officio_ Speaker or President of the Senate, and\r\nin case of the chief dying, he becomes for the remainder of the term the\r\nPresident of the United States. They are elected for 4 years, but may be\r\nre-elected indefinitely. Should the votes be equal, the House of\r\nRepresentatives selects the President from the three on the list who\r\nhave most votes, and the Senate selects the Vice in the same way. The\r\nqualifications for President and Vice are--native born, 35 years of age,\r\nand 14 years' residence in the States. The salary of the President is\r\nabout 5100l. a year, and a residence at Washington, called \"The White\r\nHouse.\" The salary of the Vice-President is 1680l. a year. There are\r\nfive Secretaries,--State, Interior, Treasury, War, Navy, and a\r\nPostmaster-General; the Attorney-General also forms part of the Cabinet.\r\nThese officials also receive the same salary. The Senate is composed of\r\ntwo members from each State, irrespective of population, so as not to\r\nswamp the small States. The election is by the Legislature of each\r\nState, and for 6 years; one-third of their number go out every 2 years.\r\nThe qualification for a senator is that he should be 30 years of age,\r\nhave been 9 years a citizen, and living in the State for which he is\r\nelected. The House of Representatives originally consisted of one member\r\nfor a certain amount of population, and as the increase in population\r\nwas very rapid, the number of Representatives increased as a matter of\r\ncourse. In 1843, it was one member for every 70,000 of population, but,\r\nto prevent the body from becoming unmanageable owing to numbers, in 1853\r\nthe House was limited to 234 Representatives, elected _pro ratâ_ to the\r\nseveral States. Slaves are reckoned in the proportion of three-fifths of\r\ntheir number. The preliminary steps are, that every 10 years a census is\r\ntaken, after which a bill is passed by Congress, apportioning number of\r\nrepresentatives to each State, according to its population. This done,\r\neach State passes a law, districting the State according to the number\r\nof members assigned it, and each district elects its own representative\r\nfor Congress. The election is for 2 years, and the qualification is 7\r\nyears a citizen, 25 years of age, and living in the State. The salary is\r\nthe same as that of a senator. The names of members composing a division\r\non any question in either house, are not printed unless they are\r\ndemanded by one-fifth of the members present. One of the clauses of\r\ntheir Constitution is very original, and runs thus:--\"Each House may\r\ndetermine the rules of its proceedings, punish its members for\r\ndisorderly behaviour, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a\r\nmember.\"\r\n\r\nAll impeachments are tried in the Senate, and a majority of two-thirds\r\nis requisite for a conviction. If the President be on trial, the Chief\r\nJustice, or head of the Supreme Court, presides. While power of trial\r\nrests with the Senate, the power of impeachment rests solely with the\r\nHouse of Representatives. In addition to the ordinary functions of an\r\nUpper House, the Senate has also what is called \"an Executive Session,\"\r\nwhich is held with closed doors; at this Session all treaties and high\r\nappointments are discussed, and the appointments are not held to be\r\nvalid till ratified by them. Whenever fresh land becomes sufficiently\r\npopulous, the general Government admit it as territory, and appoint an\r\nadministration. This was the case with Nebraska and Kansas in 1853; and\r\nthe \"Missouri Compromise\" (which confined slavery south of the 36º 3'\r\nparallel of latitude) having been repealed, it became optional with them\r\nto adopt slavery or not. Kansas fought barbarously for the dishonourable\r\nprivilege, and with temporary success: Nebraska has declined the honour\r\nas yet. The interests of territories are watched over at Washington by\r\ndelegates in the House of Representatives, who have a seat, but no vote.\r\nThis sensible arrangement might, in my humble opinion, be adopted in\r\nthis country with reference to our colonies, whose wants at present have\r\nno interpreter intimately acquainted with colonial affairs in either\r\nbranch of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nEach State in the Union has its own Governor, House of Representatives,\r\nSenate, and Judiciary, and is in every respect a sovereign State--they\r\nlike the word as much as they pretend to dislike the reality--acting\r\nperfectly independently within its limits, except in such cases as were\r\nmutually agreed upon by the terms of the Union, and to some of which we\r\nshall refer by and by. This sovereignty of individual States renders the\r\nelective franchise different in different States.\r\n\r\nAt the date of the first elections after the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, no State admitted mere citizenship as a qualification for\r\nthe elective franchise. The great men who appeared upon the stage at\r\nthat period, profiting by the experience of past ages, threw certain\r\nguards around the franchise in every State in the Union, varying in\r\ndifferent States, but all bearing unmistakeable testimony to the fact,\r\nthat a perfect democracy was not the basis on which they ever\r\ncontemplated building up the Republic. A few short years have rolled by;\r\nthe 13 States are increased to 33, and according to Mr. Tremenheere, \"a\r\ngrave departure from the theory of the Constitution, as it existed in\r\nthe eyes and expectations of its careful and prudent founders, has taken\r\nplace, in the gradual lowering throughout nearly all the States of the\r\nUnion, and the entire abandonment in two-thirds of them, of those\r\nqualifications for the exercise of the franchise which existed when the\r\nConstitution was adopted.\" In one State--Illinois--aliens being\r\nresidents are entitled to vote. Now, if the great men of 1776 thought\r\nsafeguards around the franchise wise and prudent in their day, before\r\nthe great tide of emigration had set in to the westward, and when the\r\npopulation was only 4,000,000, what would they say, could they but rise\r\nfrom their graves and see how their successors have thrown down the\r\nprudent barriers they had raised, and laid the franchise bare to\r\ncitizenship, now that the Union numbers 23,000,000 souls, and that the\r\ntide of emigration is daily flooding them with hordes of the\r\ndiscontented and turbulent from every country in the Old World?\r\n\r\nBut perhaps it may be said that I, as an Englishman, am prejudiced\r\nagainst republican institutions in any shape; let me, then, quote you an\r\nauthority which every educated American will respect. Mr. Justice Kent\r\nsays, \"The progress and impulse of popular opinion, is rapidly\r\ndestroying every constitutional check, every conservative element,\r\nintended by the sages who framed the earliest American Constitutions as\r\nsafeguards against the abuses of popular suffrage.\" Let us turn to\r\nanother equally eminent American authority, Mr. Justice Story. \"It might\r\nbe urged, that it is far from being clear, upon reasoning or experience,\r\nthat uniformity in the composition of a representative body is either\r\ndesirable or expedient, founded in sounder policy, or more promotive of\r\nthe general good, than a mixed system, embracing, representing, and\r\ncombining distinct interests, classes, and opinions. In England, the\r\nHouse of Commons, as a representative body, is founded upon no uniform\r\nprinciple, either of numbers, or classes, or places; ... and in every\r\nsystem of reform which has found public favour in that country, many of\r\nthese diversities have been embodied from choice, as important checks\r\nupon undue legislation, as facilitating the representation of different\r\ninterests and different opinions, and as thus securing, by a\r\nwell-balanced and intelligent representation of all the various classes\r\nof society, a permanent protection of the public liberties of the\r\npeople, and a firm security of the private rights of persons and\r\nproperty.\"\r\n\r\nThus far I have quoted the opinions of the highest American authorities\r\nupon the franchise. And, as far as the lowering it in England affords us\r\nany light, I would wish some unbiased and competent person to inform the\r\npublic, whether--whatever other benefit it may have procured to the\r\ncommunity--it has increased or decreased bribery and corruption; and how\r\nthe balance between advantage and disadvantage will stand, in reference\r\nto the community at large, by a further lowering of the franchise in\r\nthis country; and also to what extent--if any--it can be lowered,\r\nwithout throwing all but unlimited power into the hands of the masses,\r\nand thus destroying that balance of the different interests of the\r\ncommunity which are--thank God--still represented, and which, if once\r\nlost, would reduce our beloved Sovereign to the position of a gaudy\r\npuppet, and the House of Lords to a mere cypher, and be as certainly\r\nfollowed by all the horrors of a revolution, and all the evils of a\r\ncorrupt democracy. How easy is it to find politicians ever ready to\r\nsniff the incense of popularity at the plausible shrine of a descending\r\nfranchise!--how difficult to find those who, while granting what is just\r\nand prudent, have the wisdom to plan, and the courage to dare, measures\r\nto arrest a mobular avalanche!\r\n\r\nWith regard to the frequency of elections, I will only insert the\r\nfollowing sentence from Mr. Justice Story, as, I believe, public opinion\r\nin this country is all but universal in its condemnation: \"Men, to act\r\nwith vigour and effect, ... must not be hurried on to their conclusions\r\nby the passions of elections has a tendency to create agitation and\r\ndissensions in the public mind, to nourish factions and encourage\r\nrestlessness, to favour rash innovations in domestic legislation and\r\npublic policy, and to produce violent and sudden changes in the\r\nadministration of public affairs, founded upon temporary excitements and\r\nprejudices: ... it operates also as a great discouragement upon suitable\r\ncandidates offering themselves for the public service ... the period of\r\nservice ought, therefore, to bear some proportion to the variety of\r\nknowledge and practical skill which the duties of the station\r\ndemand.\"--If any annual-parliament maniac still exist, let him profit by\r\nthese words of wisdom from the pen of a republican, dipped in the ink of\r\nPrudence and Patriotism; and in the marked difference between the House\r\nof Representatives and the Senate Chamber--the former of whom are\r\nelected for two, the latter for six years--let him behold the most\r\nincontrovertible living proof's of their truth. John Jay, one of the\r\nmost able men of America, writing to Washington, expresses his wish that\r\nthe Upper House, or Senate, should be elected for life.\r\n\r\nI will now turn to a topic which probably interests the British public\r\nmore than any other--except the franchise--I mean the Ballot. So much\r\nhas been said about the coercion of voters by those on whom they are\r\ndependent, and so much disgraceful jobbery at elections in this country\r\nhas been laid bare, that if the Ballot were really a panacea for the\r\nevil, every patriot should exert his utmost energies to forward the\r\nintroduction of so essential a measure. In reading any American document\r\nwhere the word \"ballot\" is used, it must be remembered that, unless the\r\nword \"secret\" precede it, the meaning is merely voting by an open piece\r\nof paper on which the name of the candidate is printed, and which he may\r\nenclose in an envelope or not, as he chooses. It is, therefore, only\r\nwith the secret ballot we have to deal at present; for although the\r\npower to vote secretly exists, it is obvious, that unless secret voting\r\nis made compulsory, it affords no protection to those who are in a\r\nposition to be bribed or coerced, inasmuch as those who did bribe or\r\ncoerce would insist upon the vote so obtained being given openly.\r\n\r\nIt will perhaps astonish an Englishman to be told that \"secret\" ballot\r\nis all but unknown in the United States. Nevertheless, such is the case.\r\nAn act was passed some four years ago in Massachusetts requiring\r\nsecrecy; and what was the effect of this act? A large body of the\r\nelectors met together to denounce with indignation any attempt at\r\nenforcing that which they repudiated as unworthy of freemen. So strong\r\nwas this feeling that in 1853, the act which enforced it was repealed,\r\nand in the convention called to discuss the revision of their\r\nConstitution--according to Mr. Tremenheere--although the democratic\r\nparty were in a great majority, the effort to impose secrecy was thrown\r\nout by a majority of 5000[CB].\r\n\r\nA friend of mine, who took considerable interest in this question, was\r\npresent at the elections for the State of Massachusetts, and when, at\r\nthe same time, a popular vote was to be taken on the proposed revision\r\nof the Constitution; this latter was by special enactment made\r\ncompulsorily secret. How far this object was attained, the following\r\nstatement will show. As the voters came up to the polling-place, tickets\r\nwere offered them by the agents of the opposite parties, in a large room\r\nfull of people. The voters selected whichever ticket they preferred, in\r\nthe presence of the whole room, and then, in compliance with the terms\r\nof the enactment, they sealed it up in an envelope before depositing it\r\nin the voting-box. So much for compulsory secrecy. Of course on this\r\noccasion, as on all electioneering occasions, the voters might have\r\nconcealed their votes, had they chosen so to do.\r\n\r\nThe only States, that I am aware of, where secrecy is enjoined by law\r\nare New York and Indiana; and in the former of these I can most\r\ncertainly testify, from personal observation, that in many instances, if\r\nnot in most, it is a dead letter. I never met a soul who, in talking\r\nabout politics, ever thought of concealing his sentiments. I am\r\ntherefore forced to the conclusion that secrecy only exists among the\r\nvery lowest; and here it may be as well to introduce the opinions of the\r\nGovernor of this important State. Mr. Washington Hunt, in his Message of\r\nJanuary 7, 1851, says, \"The alarming increase of bribery in our popular\r\nelections demands your serious attention. The preservation of our\r\nliberties depends on the purity of the elective franchise, and its\r\nindependent exercise by the citizen, and I trust you will adopt such\r\nmeasures as shall effectually protect the ballot-box from all corrupting\r\ninfluences.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any efforts were made to stay the tide of corruption, the message of\r\nthe same Governor the following year will enable you to judge of their\r\nsuccess. In his address on the 6th of January, 1852, this paragraph\r\noccurs: \"The increase of corrupt practices in our elections has become a\r\nsubject of general and just complaint: it is represented that in some\r\nlocalities the suffrages of considerable numbers of voters have been\r\nopenly purchased with money. We owe it to ourselves and to posterity,\r\nand to the free institutions which we have inherited, to crush this\r\nhateful evil in its infancy, before it attains sufficient growth to\r\nendanger our political system. The honest and independent exercise of\r\nthe right of suffrage is a vital principle in the theory of\r\nrepresentative government. It is the only enduring foundation for a\r\nrepublic. Not only should the law punish every violation of this\r\nprinciple as a crime against the integrity of the State, but any person\r\nconcerned in giving or receiving any pecuniary consideration for a vote\r\nshould, upon challenge, be deprived of the privilege of voting. I submit\r\nthe subject to your consideration, in the hope that additional remedies\r\nmay be prescribed and enforced.\"--The two foregoing extracts do equal\r\ncredit to the head and heart of Governor Hunt; but what a picture do\r\nthey portray of the effects of secret voting!\r\n\r\nLet us now turn from Governor Hunt, and see what the Press says on the\r\nsubject. The _New York Herald_, which if not highly esteemed is at least\r\nwidely circulated, thus writes in the month of May, 1852:--\"Look at the\r\nproceedings on Thursday last in the 19th Ward. Voters carried to the\r\nballot-boxes in scores of waggons from, various localities; and, in\r\nother wards, hundreds of democrats voting for Scott and for Fillmore,\r\nmen ignorant and steeped in crime, picked up in all the purlieus of the\r\ncity and purchased at a dollar a head; and some, it is said, so low as\r\nhalf a dollar, to deposit in the ballot-box a vote they had never\r\nseen.\"--The article then goes on to explain the methods employed at\r\nelections--viz., a lazy fellow who wont work, brawls, and drinks, and\r\nspouts, and defames every honest man in the ward, till he becomes a\r\nsemi-deity among the riff-raff, then \"his position is found out by those\r\nwho want to use him. He is for sale to the highest bidder, either to\r\ndefeat his own party by treachery, or to procure a nomination for any\r\nscoundrel who will pay for it. He has no politics of any kind. He has\r\nrascality to sell, and there are those who are willing to purchase it,\r\nin order that they may traffic in it, and sell it to themselves again at\r\na very high profit.... We have heard of a case in one of the Lower Wards\r\nof the city, in which one man got, at the time of the late democratic\r\nconventions, the enormous sum of two thousand dollars, out of which it\r\nis said he bribed the majority of the electors and kept the balance for\r\nhimself.\"\r\n\r\nA few paragraphs further on he suggests remedies for the evil;--and what\r\ndo you suppose they are? First, that honest people should not leave\r\npolitics to the riff-raff. Secondly, \"there ought to be a registration\r\nestablished, by which no man could sail under false colours, or deposit\r\na vote at a primary election, unless he belonged to the ward, and\r\nbelonged to the party to which he professed to belong.\" Conceive the\r\nstate to which secret voting has reduced the wealthy and intelligent\r\ncity of New York; absolutely, a return to open voting is considered\r\ninsufficient to reach the vitals of the evil which secrecy has brought\r\nabout. Here we have proposed as a remedy _the compulsory register of\r\npolitical sentiments_; and to prove that things are not mending, in the\r\n\"Retrospect of the year 1852,\" which forms a leading article in the same\r\njournal at the commencement of 1853, after a lengthy panegyric upon the\r\nstate of America, &c., during 1852, he winds up with these most serious\r\ndrawbacks to the previous eulogy: \"if we are bound to admit with crimson\r\nblush that crime is sadly on the increase, and that our municipal\r\ninstitutions have reached the lowest depths of inefficiency and infamy,\r\nthese but remind us that the work which 1852 has bravely carried on is\r\nnot yet achieved.\"--I would wish carefully to guard against being\r\nunderstood to endorse the violent language employed by the _New York\r\nHerald_. I am aware how unsafe a guide the Press ever is in times of\r\npolitical excitement; but after making every reasonable allowance,\r\nenough remains to prove the tendency of the secret ballot, corroborated\r\nas it is by the authoritative message of the Governor of the State.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn for a moment to that most witty and amusing writer,\r\nSydney Smith. In speaking of Mr. Grote's proposal for the ballot, the\r\nauthor says, \"He tells us that the bold cannot be free, and bids us\r\nseek for liberty by clothing ourselves in the mask of falsehood, and\r\ntrampling on the cross of truth;\"--and further on, towards the end of\r\nthe pamphlet, he quotes an authority that Americans must respect--\"Old\r\nJohn Randolph, the American orator, was asked one day, at a dinner-party\r\nin London, whether the ballot prevailed in his State of Virginia? 'I\r\nscarcely believe,' he said, 'we have such a fool in all Virginia as to\r\nmention even the vote by ballot; and I do not hesitate to say that the\r\nadoption of the ballot would make any nation a set of scoundrels if it\r\ndid not find them so.'\"--John Randolph was right; he felt that it was\r\nnot necessary that a people should be false in order to be free.\r\nUniversal hypocrisy would be the consequence of ballot. We should soon\r\nsay, on deliberation, what David only asserted in his haste, that \"all\r\nmen are liars.\"[CC]--How strangely prophetic the opinion of John\r\nRandolph appears, when read by the light of the _New York Herald_ of\r\n1852.\r\n\r\nIt has always appeared to me that the argument in favour of ballot which\r\nis drawn from its use in clubs, if it prove anything at all, is rather\r\nagainst than for it; its value there arises from the fact of the\r\nindependence of the members, which enables any member if asked by the\r\nrejected candidate how he had voted, to decline giving any answer\r\nwithout fear of consequences. Were he dependent, he must either deny the\r\nblack-ball he gave, had he so voted, or, confessing the fact, he must\r\nsuffer for it, and silence would be sure to be construed into a\r\nblack-ball: therefore, before ballot could be of any value to a\r\nconstituency, they must be independent; and if independent, there would\r\nbe no need of the ballot. Of course secrecy could be obtained by\r\nfalsehood. Moreover, the object of it in a club is to keep out of a\r\nselect society not only those who are considered absolutely offensive,\r\nbut many with whom, though you might like to meet them in general\r\nsociety, you do not think it desirable to be on more intimate terms; and\r\neven in a club, who will deny that it is often used to gratify private\r\nmalice, and frequently, when candidates are numerous, are black-balls\r\nput in to hasten forward the election of friends? While freely\r\nconfessing and deeply regretting the disgraceful jobbery and bribery\r\nwhich an inquiry into our own elections too often reveals, we ought to\r\nbe thankful for the light of experience which a contemplation of the\r\nelective system of the United States affords, warning us as it does that\r\nan imprudent lowering of the franchise and a recourse to the secret\r\nballot do but aggravate the evils they were intended to cure. Before we\r\nproceed to lower our franchise, should we not do wisely to try and\r\ndevise some means for obtaining the votes of those already entitled to\r\nvote? Many an honest and industrious artisan at present entitled to a\r\nvote will not come to the poll on account of the violence which--if not\r\nof the mobular party--he may be subject to; his family depend on his\r\nexertions for their daily bread--a broken limb, or any such accident\r\nhappening to him, may bring the whole family to deep distress, if not to\r\nthe workhouse. It appears by the _Edinburgh Review_ of October, 1852,\r\nthat at a previous general election, 40 per cent, of those possessing\r\nthe privilege did not poll their votes. A hasty lowering of the\r\nfranchise would certainly increase that number, and thus while losing\r\nmore votes of the peaceful and industrious citizens, we should be\r\nincreasing those of the more turbulent, and of those who are excited by\r\ndesigning demagogues.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the United States. In the former edition I omitted to\r\nexplain that \"a Congress\" meant a Parliament for two years--the term for\r\nwhich the representatives are elected. One of the sessions is from the\r\nfirst Monday in December to about the end of August, and is called the\r\nlong session; the other commences the same day, and sits till the 4th\r\nMarch, and is called the short session; but, besides these regular\r\nsittings, there may be extra sessions as often as the President thinks\r\nfit to assemble Congress. At the time I was in the States, by a fiction\r\nvery agreeable to the members, if Congress closed the session on Monday,\r\nand the President ordered its reassembling on Tuesday, the members were\r\nsupposed to be at their respective homes, and received mileage payment\r\naccordingly. This snug little bonus was called \"constructive mileage.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1856 an act was passed fixing the payment of members at\r\n1260l. each for their services in each Congress of two years, and\r\nabolishing the constructive mileage job. The only deduction from the\r\nabove is that made for non-attendance of members. The payment is thus\r\narranged:--Each member receives 1l. 13s. 6d. for every day he\r\nattends in Congress; the whole number of days a session lasts are\r\ncalculated at the above rate, and the difference between that amount and\r\n630l. (the half of 1260l.) is a bonus given, at the end of the first\r\nyear's session, and is in lieu of all further payments for any extra\r\nsessions which the President may think it advisable to call during the\r\nyear. It will thus be seen that each member receives the same sum, minus\r\n1l. 13s. 6d. for every day's non-attendance.\r\n\r\nMileage is allowed at the rate of 1l. 13s. 6d.. for every twenty\r\nmiles distance to and fro, but only for one session each; year. The\r\nadvantage Texas and Californian members obtain from this liberal\r\nallowance is obvious, and its injustice is felt by those who live in the\r\nneighbouring States to Washington.\r\n\r\nNow, as travelling, in most parts of the Union, is at the rate of less\r\nthan 2d. a mile, and living at the rate of two and a half dollars\r\n(10s. 6d.) a day, it is obvious that the situation of a\r\nrepresentative is advantageous in a pecuniary point of view to those who\r\nwish to make a trade of politics. A member coming from a distance, say\r\nof 200 miles, and attending 120 days, would have a clear balance of\r\nabout 150l. left for the rest of the year; and a member from Texas\r\nwould clear about 500l. How far such a measure is wise, and brings the\r\nmost desirable men into the public service, let their own countrymen\r\ntell. Mr. Venables, of North Carolina, in a speech at Richmond, Virginia\r\n(quoted by Mr. Tremenheere) says, \"With money enough, any bill can be\r\ncarried through Congress.\" No nation--and, least of all, so very\r\nsensitive a nation as the United States--would pass an act which could\r\npossibly throw a cloud of doubt over the integrity of its\r\nrepresentatives were there not some imperative necessity; the act\r\nreferred to below will be found in page 363 of _Appendix_ to\r\nTremenheere's _Constitution of the United States_, one clause of which\r\nruns thus:--\"That any senator or representative in Congress who, after\r\nthe passage of this act ... shall receive any gratuity, or any share of,\r\nor interest in, any claim from any claimant against the United States,\r\n&c., on conviction shall pay a fine not exceeding 5000 dollars\r\n(1000l.), suffer imprisonment in the Penitentiary, not exceeding one\r\nyear, or both, as the court in its discretion shall adjudge.\" Another\r\nclause follows, against the knowing and wilful destruction of public\r\ndocuments; another, against any individual who shall tempt any member of\r\nthe Senate or House of Representatives with bribe of any kind to\r\ninfluence his vote, and against members accepting the same. This act\r\nbears date Feb. 26, 1853, and certainly proves that Mr. Venables'\r\nassertion had some solid foundation in truth.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered by some that Collins, finding the Cunard line of\r\nsteamers, when supported by Government, too strong for him to contend\r\nagainst, applied to Congress for a Government grant. In obtaining that\r\ngrant, I do not pretend to say that he, or any one on his behalf, used\r\nbribery or corruption, when he took round one of his magnificent vessels\r\nto Washington, and feasted Congress on board in a most champagnely\r\nstyle; but this I know, that many Americans were most indignant at the\r\nproceeding, for, coupled with the act above referred to, it could not\r\nbut excite suspicion; and I feel sure, if Cunard had brought round one\r\nof his splendid steamers to the Thames, and there feasted the\r\nLegislature while his obtaining a Government grant was under discussion,\r\nhe could not have taken a more effectual method to mar his object. _La\r\nfemme de César ne doit pas être suspecte_. Thus, then, as far as we can\r\njudge of any advantage to be derived from payment of members, we can see\r\nnothing to induce us to adopt such a system; and, if I mistake not, the\r\nAmerican himself feels disposed to give it up, believing that the\r\nstandard of the representative will be raised thereby.\r\n\r\nWe will now make a few remarks upon a body peculiar to America, and\r\nknown as \"the Lobby.\" But, first, I would observe that, by a rule in\r\nboth Houses, changeable at pleasure, ex-members of Congress, ministers,\r\nsecretaries of legation, &c., are allowed the privilege of coming within\r\nthe bar to hear debates; and of the people so privileged the Lobby is\r\nchiefly composed. They have no counterpart in this country, but may\r\nperhaps be said to have a faint and distant resemblance to our\r\nParliamentary agents, and they are in no way recognised by Congress.\r\nTheir work consists in endeavouring to force all members who purpose\r\npresenting public or private bills to employ them, which, of course,\r\ninvolves a \"consideration;\" and, as their name is \"Legion,\" and their\r\nmotto on this point \"unanimity,\" they are enabled, owing to their\r\ninfluence with the members, to throw the greatest possible obstruction\r\nin the way of most bills which are not passed through their \"greased\r\npalms.\" The result need not be described. The correspondent of the\r\n_Times_, who, if report he correct, has held the highest situations a\r\ncitizen of the United States can hold, states, in a letter to be found\r\nin that journal, on the 27th January 1857, that the Minnesota Land Bill\r\nhad been said, in the House of Representatives, to be supported by\r\nbribery, and that one member openly avowed in his seat that he had been\r\noffered 1500 dollars for his vote in favour of the bill. The consequence\r\nwas an inquiry into the alleged charge, and doubtless it will affect the\r\nweight of the Lobby. He adds--\"The Lobby has, no doubt, great influence\r\non the Legislature, but it is not yet all-powerful.\" In estimating the\r\neffect of a vote, it must be remembered that there are only 234 members\r\nin the House of Representatives, and 62 in the Senate; and, to give some\r\nidea of the interests concerned, the correspondent states--\"It is\r\nscarcely an exaggeration to say that the Federal Congress at Washington\r\nhas a disposing power over twice the amount of national property subject\r\nto the votes of the Parliament at Westminster.\" Those who feel an\r\ninterest in this subject I would strongly urge to read the whole of the\r\nvery able letter alluded to.\r\n\r\nI have before spoken of the very great readiness with which any stranger\r\ngains admittance to Congress to listen to the debates. As a broad\r\nfeature, I believe their discussions are carried on in a sober,\r\npractical, business-like manner; nevertheless, most outrageous scenes\r\nhave occurred. I subjoin the following extract, not from any one\r\nsentence it contains, but from its continuity, as a proof that the tone\r\nof the House is not worthy of the dignity of so great a country. A\r\nmember of any community may get up and use the most gross and offensive\r\nlanguage; but if the offender be immediately called to order, and made\r\nto retract the offensive expressions, the community thus vindicates its\r\ncharacter. Should, however, the most gross and offensive language be\r\nused by two members for any length of time without any interference,\r\nreprobation, retraction, or punishment, the community as a body must\r\nfairly be considered, by their silence, as endorsing such conduct.\r\n\r\nThe extract is taken from that widely circulating journal, \"the\r\n_Illustrated London News_:--\r\n\r\n\"In the House of Representatives at Washington, on the 11th ult., the\r\nfollowing amusing but disgraceful scene occurred between two of the\r\nmembers--Messrs. Stanly and Giddings. The former having charged the\r\nlatter with uttering a falsehood, the following conversation ensued:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Stanly: 'It is usual for one who has no regard for the decencies of\r\nlife to relieve himself from responsibility by pronouncing statements\r\nfalse, and it is characteristic of the man who sneaked away from this\r\nHouse, and took his pay for work which he did not do.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Giddings: 'When the gentleman descends to low vulgarity, I cannot\r\nfollow him, I protest against Dough-faces prompting the gentleman from\r\nSouth Carolina.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Stanly: 'It is the business of a scavenger to have anything to do\r\nwith him, and I will have to wash my hands after handling him; but the\r\nthing has to be done, as he has thrust himself on us as a kind of\r\ncensor. It is a small business for me, and I don't know how I can\r\ndescend any lower than to take hold of the hon. member for Ohio. (Cry of\r\n'Good.')\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Giddings: 'Will you hear me?\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Stanly: 'Nobody wants to hear you, but I will indulge you.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Giddings: 'The gentleman is barking up the wrong tree.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Stanly: 'The galled jade winces again.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Giddings: 'The gentleman sha'n't crack the overseer's lash to put\r\nme down.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Stanly: 'I hope that the gentleman will not gnash his teeth so\r\nhard; he might hurt himself. Who is here playing the overseer over white\r\nmen--who but he, who is throwing his filthy gall and assailing everybody\r\nas Northern Whig Dough-faces, and what he calls the vile slave-holders?\r\nHe is the only man who acts in that way. We don't raise the overseer's\r\nlash over our slaves in North Carolina. If that member was in the\r\nsouthern country, nobody would own him as a black man with a white\r\nskin--(laughter)--but he would be suffered to run wild as a free negro,\r\nand in the course of three weeks he would be brought up to the\r\nwhipping-post and lashed, for stealing or slandering his neighbours.\r\n(Laughter.) If I say that he is a gentleman, I tell a falsehood.\r\n\r\n\"The Speaker (to Mr. Stanly)--'Will the gentleman suspend for a moment?\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Stanly: 'We ought to suspend that fellow (pointing to Mr. Giddings)\r\nby the neck. (Laughter.)\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Giddings: 'The gentleman from North Carolina reminds me of the boy\r\nwho turned round so fast that the hind part of his breeches was on both\r\nsides. (Laughter.) The gentleman says that I was at Norristown, too; but\r\nwhere was he and the members of the House? Why, drinking their grog.\r\n(Laughter.)\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Stanly: 'I charge the official reporters not to let his (Mr.\r\nGiddings') felonious hand touch one word of what I say, for we know how\r\nhe on a former occasion misrepresented my colleague from the Orange\r\ndistrict, and his own colleague from the Chillicothe district, having\r\naltered his own speech after he got to his room with his coloured\r\nfriends. (Laughter.) He talks about my associates: but has anybody ever\r\nseen him in private decent company? Free negroes may call to see him. He\r\ndoes not let his right hand know what his left doeth. He alludes to my\r\nabsence; but I have not set myself up as a standard. I don't say I'm\r\nalways in the house as I ought to be. He says we were here drinking our\r\ngrog during Christmas times. Where was he? In Philadelphia, drinking\r\nbeer and eating oysters with free negroes. (Laughter.) Which was the\r\nbest off? Judge ye. (Laughter.) He thinks he was better off than we\r\nwere. [Mr. Stanly paused, and, looking towards Mr. Preston King, who was\r\nstanding near Sir. Giddings, remarked, raising his voice to a higher\r\npitch, \"Help him out; he needs a little more poison.\" (Voices, \"Ha, ha!\r\nGood! Ha, ha!\")] I quit this subject in disgust. I find that I have been\r\nin a dissecting-room, cutting up a dead dog. I will treat him as an\r\ninsane man, who was never taught the decencies of life, proprieties of\r\nconduct--whose associations show that he never mingled with gentlemen.\r\nLet him rave on till doomsday.'\r\n\r\n\"The conversation then ceased.\"\r\n\r\nAny one who has seen much of American gentlemen, must know that such\r\nlanguage as the above contains would be reprobated by them fully as\r\nstrongly as by any gentleman in this country. To doubt that would be to\r\ndo them a gross injustice. Does not, therefore, the recurrence of such\r\nscenes go far to prove, that the advance of ultra-democratic principles\r\nhas the effect of lowering the tone of the Representative Chamber, and\r\nthat men of liberal education and gentlemanly bearing do not constitute\r\nthe majority in that House? In the days of Washington, would any member\r\nhave dared to use, or would any other member have for a moment\r\ntolerated, such language? It is but justice to say, that the tone of the\r\nSenate Chamber is far more dignified; and many who have been members of\r\nthat body have established a world-wide reputation both as orators and\r\nstatesmen.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn for a few minutes to that important subject, the\r\nJudiciary of the States, one peculiar feature of which is, its being a\r\nco-ordinate branch of the Legislature. The Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates is the highest tribunal in the country; it consists of a Chief\r\nJustice and eight associate Justices, the Attorney-General, a reporter,\r\nand a clerk. All questions affecting foreign ambassadors, consuls, &c.,\r\nare tried before this court; and it is a final court of appeal in cases\r\ninvolving constitutional questions, and various others, too long to\r\nenumerate here. It has even the power of annulling the acts of the\r\nFederal Congress at Washington, if such acts are contrary to the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nThe following article in the Constitution regulates the terms upon which\r\nalone any change may be made, and which is of so peculiar and\r\nconservative a character that I insert it in full:--\r\n\r\n  \"ARTICLE V.--_Power of Amendment_.\r\n\r\n  \"The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem it\r\n  necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution, or, on the\r\n  application of the Legislatures of two-thirds of the several States,\r\n  shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which, in either\r\n  case, shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this\r\n  Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three-fourths of\r\n  the several States, or by conventions in three-fourths thereof, as the\r\n  one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress;\r\n  provided that no amendment which may be made prior to the year one\r\n  thousand eight hundred and eight, shall in any manner affect the first\r\n  and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article, and that\r\n  no State, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage\r\n  in the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing article is a remarkable instance of prudence and\r\nforethought, and acts as the strongest safeguard against hasty measures,\r\nwhich in times of great excitement may sometimes obtain a majority that\r\nwould afterwards be regretted by all parties. If the principle involved\r\nin any question is really felt to be of vital importance, the majority\r\ncan dissolve the Union if they consider the object in view worth the\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe salary of the Chief Justice is about 1050l. a-year. This court is,\r\nI believe, invariably composed of men of the highest talent and\r\nintegrity; their appointment is from the President, and endorsed by the\r\nSenate, and their tenure of office is \"during good behaviour.\"[CD] There\r\nhas, fortunately, been no change in the manner or term of these\r\nappointments; but, in the different States, the democratic mania has\r\nremoved the old landmarks of prudence bequeathed to them by their\r\nfathers. Mr. Tremenheere tells, that in 1833 only 5 States out of the 24\r\nhad adopted the principle of electing Judges, and appointing them for a\r\nterm of years; in 1844, 12 States out of the 29 had adopted the\r\nprinciple; and in 1853, 22 out of the 31 States had come to the same\r\nresolution. We surely have in these facts a most important warning of\r\nthe danger of introducing too much of the democratic element into the\r\nconstitution of any country. Reflect, if but for a moment, on the danger\r\nto the community, where the selection of the Judges of the land may be\r\nguided by political rancour or public clamour; the bare knowledge that\r\nsuch may be the case, even if the purity of the masses be so great as\r\nnot to admit of such sinister influence, the bare possibility, I say, is\r\ncalculated to lower the respect in which it is most desirable the\r\njudiciary should ever be held,[CE] and to deter the most pure and\r\nhigh-minded citizens from offering their services. The salaries of the\r\nJudges range from 250l. to 400l. a-year.\r\n\r\nThe next point to which I would call attention, is to be found in Art.\r\nI., sect. 6, of the Constitution of the United States, the last clause\r\nof which runs thus:--\"No person holding any office under the United\r\nStates shall be a member of either House during his continuance in\r\noffice.\" This was probably one of the most extraordinary blunders such\r\nan able body of men as the framers of the Constitution ever made; and if\r\ntheir object was to guard against corruption, and the undue influence of\r\nthe leading men of the country, it has most signally failed, as the Act\r\nbefore referred to, of February, 1853, fully testifies. Only conceive\r\nthe effect of excluding all the Cabinet and high functionaries from\r\nseats in the Lords and Commons; conceive the great statesmen of this\r\ncountry being obliged to hand over the introduction of most important\r\nmeasures, and the defence and explanation of them, to other hands. On\r\nthis point, Mr. Justice Story remarks: \"Thus, that open and public\r\nresponsibility for measures, which properly belongs to the executive in\r\nall governments, especially in a republican government, as its greatest\r\nsecurity and strength, is completely done away. The executive is\r\ncompelled to resort to secret and unseen influence,--to private\r\ninterviews and private arrangements,--to accomplish its own appropriate\r\npurposes, instead of proposing and sustaining its own duties and\r\nmeasures by a bold and manly appeal to the nation in the face of its\r\nrepresentatives. One consequence of this state of things is, that there\r\nnever can be traced home to the executive any responsibility for the\r\nmeasures which are planned and carried at its suggestion. Another\r\nconsequence will be--if it has not yet been--that measures will be\r\nadopted or defeated by private intrigues, political combinations,\r\nirresponsible recommendations, by all the blandishments of office, and\r\nall the deadening weight of silent patronage; ... ministers may conceal\r\nor evade any expression of their opinions.\"\r\n\r\nIn charity it should be presumed that in all nations which possess\r\nanything worthy of the name of free institutions, the ablest men of the\r\npolitical majority constitute the Cabinet; and, by the enactment we are\r\nconsidering, all this talent is excluded from the councils of the\r\nnation, whereas all the talent of the Opposition may be there arrayed\r\nagainst their measures. I confess it is beyond my penetration, to see\r\nhow this can be reconciled to justice or common sense; in no one\r\nprinciple of their Government did they more completely ignore the wisdom\r\nand experience of the mother country, and in the object they had in view\r\nthey appear to have most completely failed. It is but fair to the\r\ndemocrats to say it is no act of theirs; they inherited the misfortune,\r\nand are likely to keep it, as it is one of the fundamental principles of\r\ntheir Constitution, and they have a salutary dread--much to their\r\npraise--of tinkering up any flaw they find in that document, lest in\r\nmending one hole they make two. They have, as a nation, so greatly\r\nprospered under its combined enactments, and possess such an unlimited\r\nindependence in their individual States, that although the exclusion of\r\nthe Cabinet is now very generally admitted to be an error, I saw no\r\ninclination to moot the question; probably, lest other questions\r\naffecting the slave and non-slave-holding States might be brought on the\r\nboards, and again disturb the bonds of union.\r\n\r\nAnother very remarkable--and in a Republic anomalous--feature in the\r\ngovernment, is the power of the President, who, by the Constitution, is\r\nenabled during his four years' tenure of office to rule in total\r\nopposition to the majority, obstructing all the measures they may bring\r\nforward, unless the majority amounts to two-thirds in both Houses of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nArticle I., section 7, clause 2, runs thus:--\"Every bill which shall\r\nhave passed the House of Representatives and the Senate shall, before\r\nit become a law, be presented to the President of the United States; if\r\nhe approves, he shall sign it, but if not, he shall return it with his\r\nobjections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall\r\nenter the objections at large on their journal, and proceed to\r\nre-consider it. If after such re-consideration two-thirds of that House\r\nshall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with the\r\nobjections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be\r\nre-considered, and if approved by two-thirds of that House, it shall\r\nbecome a law,\" &c.\r\n\r\nThis power of the President has been used by Washington, Jackson, Tyler,\r\nand Polk; particularly by Tyler, who opposed the wishes of the majority\r\neven when those wishes were backed by his own ministry. During the\r\ndiscussions on the Constitution, many of the wisest heads at that\r\neventful period desired to establish the Presidency for life, but\r\neventually the term of four years was agreed upon; and if such powers of\r\nobstructing the wishes of a majority were to accompany the office, it\r\ncertainly was a prudent conclusion they arrived at. In a densely\r\npopulated community like Great Britain, such powers, whether in the\r\nhands of the sovereign or the ministers, would produce a revolution in\r\nmuch less time than four years. It may, however, be questioned, whether\r\nthese powers are not productive of evil, by rendering necessary such\r\nfrequent elections for the Presidency. On this point, Mr. Justice Story\r\nstates: \"The inconvenience of such frequently recurring elections of the\r\nchief magistrate, by generating factions, combining intrigues, and\r\nagitating the public mind, seems not hitherto to have attracted as much\r\nattention, as it deserves.\" And Chancellor Kent remarks, that \"the\r\nelection of a supreme executive magistrate for a whole nation affects so\r\nmany interests, addresses itself so strongly to popular passions, and\r\nholds out such powerful temptations to ambition, that it necessarily\r\nbecomes a strong trial to public virtue, and even hazardous to public\r\ntranquillity.\"\r\n\r\nThere is another evil which attends these frequent elections of the\r\nchief magistrate--namely, the enormous patronage at his disposal, and\r\nthe mass of jobbery and corruption to which the exercise of it almost\r\ninvariably leads. Besides the appointment of nearly ever military,\r\nnaval, civil, judicial, and revenue-collecting official--some of these\r\nsubject, it is true to the approval of the Senate--Mr. Justice Story\r\nremarks, that with regard to inferior offices \"his patronage probably\r\nincludes ninety-nine out of every hundred of the lucrative offices of\r\nthe government.\" His great rival in patronage is the Postmaster-General,\r\nwho has power to appoint and remove all deputy-postmasters, which, as\r\nthe number of post-offices is 22,688, amounts to something considerable.\r\n\r\nThis power was doubtless intended for the public good, and in order that\r\nincompetent or inefficient persons should be removed. To the honour of\r\nWashington, it is recorded that during his eight years' Presidency only\r\nnine removals took place. To President Jackson they are indebted, as I\r\nhave before remarked, for the introduction of the present corrupt\r\nsystem. According to Justice Story, on his entering office he removed\r\n233 _employés_; since then, the snowball has been steadily increasing\r\ntill the present moment; it has now reached an amount which it would\r\nrequire Mr. Babbage's machine to calculate. Who can doubt that such vast\r\npatronage, has far more influence in the selection of a President, than\r\nany personal qualification for the high and important post? Nothing\r\ncould prove more clearly that such influences are paramount to all\r\nothers than the last election. There were eight candidates on the\r\ndemocratic side, of whom General Pierce was not one; all the eight had\r\ntheir special friends, and each party was loth to lose the chance of\r\npatronage which their friend's election might reasonably lead them to\r\nhope for. Thus they fought so vigorously that there was no chance of any\r\none having the requisite number of votes, i.e., a majority of the\r\nwhole number polled.\r\n\r\nThe Convention being deputed by the different States to select from the\r\ncandidates already in the field, how do they get out of the difficulty\r\nat the eleventh hour? They take upon themselves to nominate a candidate\r\nfor the Presidential chair, who was not fettered by any particular\r\nfollowers, and from whom all parties hoped they would receive some share\r\nof the loaves and fishes as a reward for their support. The electors\r\nendorsed the new selection of the Convention, and General Pierce, lately\r\ncommanding a brigade in the Mexican war, was elected by a most\r\nastounding majority. Scarcely any President was ever elected with such\r\nall-but unanimity, and the Press was equally undivided in its praises.\r\nEvery paper I read, in every place I passed through, was full of the\r\nmost unbounded eulogy. But mark the change a few months made. Before\r\nthe end of the year, one-half of that Press, which had bespattered him\r\nwith such fulsome adulation during the honeymoon of which his\r\ninauguration was the centre, were filling their columns with long and\r\nloud complaints, if not abuse. And what was the chief burden of their\r\ninvective? It was the manner in which he distributed his patronage. In\r\nshort, they were discontented with the share they received of the loaves\r\nand fishes, and thus the target of their adulation during the summer of\r\nhope, became the butt for their abuse in the winter of disappointment.\r\n\r\nThere is another subject connected with these elections, which speaks\r\nwith warning voice against the presumable advantage of democracy. I\r\nwould not be misunderstood as casting the slightest reflection upon the\r\namiable qualities, intellectual powers, or administrative talents of any\r\nAmerican citizen who has been raised to the Presidency during later\r\nyears. Let any candid reader, however, whether English or American, look\r\nat the following lists of Presidents since the Constitution, and he\r\ncannot fail to observe that while the franchise was restricted in nearly\r\nevery State, those called to that high post were the marked men of the\r\nhighest talent in the country--men whose reputation and abilities were\r\npatent to the whole community; while, with the increase of democracy,\r\nthose selected during later years are men who, whatever their virtues\r\nand capabilities, were comparatively unknown. In the case of General\r\nFranklin Pierce, he was never even named by the community; but, as we\r\nhave shown, was selected by the Convention at the eleventh hour, as a\r\ncompromise of political partisanship. Let us not forget, that while some\r\nof the later Presidents were elected, Calhoun, Clay, and Webster--whose\r\nnames are the just pride of the Republic, and household words in every\r\nfamily--were passed over.[CF] Surely these simple facts may afford us\r\nsubject for profitable reflection.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now pass on from the Governor of the Republic to the Governors\r\nof individual States. Their salaries vary in different States, and range\r\nfrom 300l. to 2000l. a-year. Their election is in some States by the\r\npeople, in others by the legislature: their term of office varies; in\r\nsome States the election is annual, and in all for a very limited\r\nperiod; and under them each separate State has its own House of\r\nRepresentatives and its Senate. The chief power, which resides in the\r\nGovernor alone, is that of pardon; and here we may observe, that it is\r\nonly reasonable to suppose that so enlightened a community as the United\r\nStates would not for any considerable number of years have tolerated the\r\nmost flagrant abuse of such a power as that of pardon; and consequently\r\nthat if it be found that such abuse do now exist, it must have grown\r\nwith the ever-growing democratic element.\r\n\r\nMr. Tremenheere quotes largely from a work by Dr. Lieber, Professor of\r\nPolitical Philosophy in the State College of South Carolina. Among\r\nothers of a similar character, the following passage occurs:--\"I\r\nconsider the indiscriminate pardoning so frequent in many parts of the\r\nUnited States, one of the most hostile things, now at work in our\r\ncountry, to a perfect government of law.\" He elsewhere states \"that the\r\nNew York Committee had ascertained that there are men who make a regular\r\ntrade of procuring pardons for convicts by which they support\r\nthemselves.\" Further on he says, \"To this statement we have now to add\r\nthe still more appalling fact, which we would pass over in silence if\r\nour duty permitted it, that but a short time ago the Governor of a large\r\nState--a State among the foremost in prison discipline--was openly and\r\nwidely accused of taking money for his pardons. We have it not in our\r\npower to state whether this be true or not, but it is obvious that a\r\nstate of things which allows suspicions and charges so degrading and so\r\nruinous to a healthy condition, ought not to be borne with.\" He then\r\nsubjoins this note:--\"While these sheets are going through the press,\r\nthe papers report that the Governor of a large State has pardoned thirty\r\ncriminals, among whom were some of the worst characters, at one stroke,\r\non leaving the gubernatorial chair.\"--Among the conclusions Dr. Lieber\r\ndraws on this point, is the following astounding one--\"That the\r\nexecutive in our country is so situated that, in the ordinary course of\r\nthings, it cannot be expected of him that he will resist the abuse; at\r\nleast, that he will not resist it in many cases.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing extracts are certainly entitled to no small weight when it\r\nis remembered they come from the pen of a republican professor, writing\r\nupon \"Civil Liberty and Self-government.\" I do not pretend to say that\r\nsuch gross cases as those referred to by him came within my cognizance\r\nduring my travels, but I most certainly did hear charges made against\r\ngovernors, in more than one instance, of granting pardons through\r\ncorrupt influence.\r\n\r\nI have now given a cursory review of the leading features in the\r\nexecutive of the United States; and I have endeavoured, while doing so,\r\nto point out the effects which the gradual inroads of the democratic\r\nelement have produced. The subject is one of the deepest interest to us\r\nas Englishmen, inasmuch as it is the duty of every government to\r\nenlarge, as far as is consistent with the welfare of the nation, the\r\nliberty of the subject. The foregoing remarks on the constitution of the\r\nUnited States appear to me conclusive as to one fact--viz., that the\r\ndemocratic element may be introduced so largely as that, despite a high\r\nstandard of national education and worldly prosperity, its influence\r\nwill produce the most pernicious effect upon the government of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThis truth cannot be too strongly brought forward, for undoubtedly\r\nchange is the mania of the day; and as, in a free country, all\r\nconstitutional changes must have a liberal tendency, it behoves our\r\nlegislators to study deeply and patiently the effect produced upon any\r\ncountry whose constitution is more democratic than our own, so as to\r\nenable them, while steadily advancing with the age, to know when the\r\nwell-being of their country requires them, as true patriots, to resist\r\nthose measures which threaten injury to the social fabric committed to\r\ntheir guidance. No field can afford them more profitable subjects for\r\nreflection than the United States. Independent of the fact that her\r\ninstitutions are more democratic than our own, she possesses natural\r\nadvantages that enable her to carry them out, such as we do not; and,\r\ntherefore, the British statesman may always study her career with\r\nprofit when any great liberal movement is being agitated in his own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nLest any one should be disposed to imagine that the statements I have\r\nmade, or the deductions I have drawn, are merely the prejudices of a\r\ntraveller brought up under a constitutional monarchy, I will add a\r\npassage showing the conclusions at which one of the ablest men in\r\nAmerica has arrived.\r\n\r\nBishop Hopkins, in an address delivered before the House of Convocation\r\nof Trinity College, Hartford, after eulogizing the wisdom and\r\npatriotism, of the founders of his country, as being \"the wise master\r\nbuilders of the noblest republic in the world,\" asks what is its present\r\nstate after seventy years' brief experience? Behold the reply:--\"First,\r\nthen, we hear on every side the charge of political corruption. Bribery\r\nis practised in all our elections. The spoils of office are expected as\r\na matter of course by the victorious party. The President of the United\r\nStates dares not be impartial; for, if he were, he would lose the\r\nconfidence of his friends without gaining the confidence of his enemies.\r\nThe oldest statesmen, and the most prominent, cannot follow the dictates\r\nof their own judgment and conscience without being reproached as though\r\nthey were laying a trap for the presidential chair. The very laws of\r\nCongress are set down as the results of personal venality or ambition.\r\nThe House of Representatives, or even the Senate Chamber, are disgraced\r\nevery year by fierce passion and violent denunciation. The barbarous and\r\nunchristian duel is anticipated as quite inevitable unless it be averted\r\nby explanations which may satisfy worldly honour, in utter contempt of\r\nall religious principle. And no member of either House can go to the\r\nperformance of his public duties with any security that he may not be\r\ninsulted by coarse invective before the day is closed. Yet our rulers\r\nare never weary of lauding the character of Washington, as if they were\r\nquite convinced that the time had passed by when they might be expected\r\nto verify the language of praise by the act of imitation. When we look\r\ninto the other classes of the community, the same charge of venality and\r\ncorruption meets us again. Our merchants are accused of all sorts of\r\ndishonest management; our brokers, of stock-jobbing; our city aldermen,\r\nof bribery; our lawyers, of knavery; our justices, of complicity with\r\nthe guilty. The same worship of Mammon seems to govern the whole, and\r\nthe current phrase, 'the almighty dollar,' is a sad but powerful\r\nexponent of the universal sin which involves the mass of our\r\npopulation.\"\r\n\r\nBeing perfectly aware what a \"glass house\" of corruption we ourselves\r\nare living in, I do not quote the foregoing by way of \"throwing a\r\nstone,\" but insert it merely as a warning of the direction in which we\r\nshould not seek for an advance in purification.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote CB: Why is it that, in our yearly debate in Parliament, and in\r\nall the journals of the day, from the _Times_ down even to the _Morning\r\nAdvertiser_, the United States are always quoted as a republic where the\r\nballot succeeds, when there is no excuse for the most commonly educated\r\nman being ignorant of the fact, that the ballot, as understood in this\r\ncountry, does not exist among them?

At the same time, it must\r\nalso be observed, that all these churches are not necessarily supplied\r\nwith ministers. Their support being dependent upon their congregation,\r\nit will occasionally happen that a minister gets starved out, and some\r\ntime may elapse before a successor is appointed; the inconvenience of\r\nwhich contingency occurring is obvious. More than one such case came\r\nunder my own observation when travelling through the country.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the distribution of the churches, the only peculiarity I\r\nobserve is, that the Unitarian community appear to be nearly all\r\ngathered into one spot, and that spot the Land of the Pilgrim Fathers,\r\nand the State that is considered foremost in education. Out of 243\r\nchurches, 163 are situated in Massachusetts. I have never heard any\r\nreason given for this curious fact; doubtless the great talents of\r\nChanning tended to swell their numbers, but could hardly account for the\r\nextraordinary proportion established in this State.\r\n\r\nIn proportion to its numbers, it will be seen that the Episcopal is the\r\nwealthiest of all Churches; and yet we find complaint made of the\r\ninsufficiency of the support for their ministers. Bishop Eastburn, of\r\nMassachusetts, in a pastoral letter, states that in his diocese\r\n\"respectable parents will not bring up their children to the clerical\r\nprofession, because the salaries hardly keep people from starving.\" How\r\nfar this is true generally, or whether confined to his own\r\nneighbourhood, I cannot say. The Episcopal Church in America is free\r\nfrom the violent factions that have distracted and thrown obloquy upon\r\nthe sister church in this country. The puerile struggle about surplices,\r\nand candles, and steps up to altars, and Brussels lace offerings, appear\r\nto have attracted little attention among those in America, whose\r\ntheological views assimilate with the extreme high party in England: and\r\nI never heard, during my residence in the States, any of that violent\r\nand uncharitable language with which discussions on religious topics too\r\nfrequently abound in this country; nor is the Episcopal community by any\r\nmeans so divided as it is here. The Bishop of New Zealand is far nearer\r\ntheir type than the controversial prelate of Exeter.\r\n\r\nThe Book of Common Prayer, as arranged by Convention in 1790, is well\r\nworthy of notice, and, in many points, of imitation. These pages are not\r\nthe proper place for a theological discussion, and my only reason for\r\ntouching upon the subject at all is, that the public voice is constantly\r\ncalling for some modification of the great length of our present Sunday\r\nservices, and I therefore conclude that the following observations may\r\nbe interesting to some of my readers.\r\n\r\nThe leading points of retrenchment are--removing all repetitions, such\r\nas the Lord's Prayer, the Creed, and the Collect for the day; a portion\r\nof the close of the Litany is omitted at the discretion of the minister.\r\nThe Communion Service is not read every Sunday. I suppose the Church\r\nauthorizes this omission at the discretion of the minister, as I have\r\nattended service on more than one occasion when the Communion was not\r\nread; when read, Our Lord's commandment, Matthew xxii. 37-40, follows\r\nthe Commandments of the Old Testament, and a short Collect, followed by\r\nthe Collect, Epistle, and Gospel for the day, finish that portion of the\r\nservice. Independent of the regular Psalms, for the day, there are ten\r\nseparate short collections, any one of which the minister may substitute\r\nfor the proper Psalms, and the Gloria Patri is only said after the last\r\nPsalm.\r\n\r\nThe leading features of difference from our own \"Common Prayer\" are as\r\nfollow:--They appoint proper Second Lessons for the Sunday, instead of\r\nleaving them, to the chance of the Calendar--they place the Nicene and\r\nApostles' Creed side by side, and leave the minister to select which he\r\nprefers, and to use, if he think proper, the word \"Hades\" instead of\r\nHell. They remove the Athanasian Creed entirely from the Prayer Book,\r\nleaving to the minister to explain the mysteries which that creed so\r\nsummarily disposes of. When it is considered how many Episcopalians are\r\nopposed to its damnatory clauses, and how much more nearly the other\r\ncreeds resemble that model of simplicity, the Lord's Prayer, they appear\r\nto have exercised a sound discretion in this excision. Few\r\ndeep-thinking people, I imagine, can have heard the children of the\r\nparish school reading the responses of that creed after the minister,\r\nwithout pain.\r\n\r\nLest the passing opinion of a traveller upon the subject be deemed hasty\r\nor irreverent, I beg to quote Bishop Tomline's opinion. He says--\"Great\r\nobjections have been made to the clauses which denounce eternal\r\ndamnation against those who do not believe the faith as here stated; and\r\nit certainly is to be lamented that assertions of so peremptory a\r\nnature, unexplained and unqualified, should have been used in any human\r\ncomposition.... Though I firmly believe that the doctrines of this creed\r\nare all founded on Scripture, I cannot but conceive it to be both\r\nunnecessary and presumptuous to say that, \"except every one do keep them\r\nwhole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.\" Mr.\r\nWheatley also, when writing on the Creed, says, that the third and\r\nfourth verses constitute the creed, and that what follows \"requires our\r\nassent no more than a sermon does, which is made to prove or illustrate\r\na text.\"--To resume.\r\n\r\nThey have proper prayers and thanksgivings for individuals who desire\r\ntheir use, instead of, as with us, introducing a few words into the\r\nordinary service. They have provided a liberal collection of psalms and\r\nhymns for singing in church, and no others are allowed to be used. Each\r\npsalm and hymn has the Gloria Patri suited to it marked at the\r\nbeginning. The inconvenience of the total want of such a provision in\r\nour Church is most palpable. Not long before I went to America, I was\r\nattending a parish church in the country, where a great proportion of\r\nthe psalms and hymns used were the minister's own composition, and if I\r\nrecollect right, the book cost half-a-crown. I came up to town, and I\r\nfound my parish church there had a selection under the sanction of the\r\nBishop of London. Since my return from America, I have gone to the same\r\nLondon church, under the same Bishop, and I have found a totally\r\ndifferent book in use.--The foregoing are the principal alterations in\r\nthe Sunday services.\r\n\r\nThe alterations in the other services are chiefly the following:--In the\r\nfull Communion Service, the word \"condemnation\" is substituted for\r\n\"damnation,\" in the notice of intimation. The whole of the damnatory\r\nclause in the exhortation, from the word \"unworthily\" to \"sundry kinds\r\nof death,\" is expunged. The first prayer in our Church after the\r\nreception, is modified by them into an oblation and invocation, and\r\nprecedes the reception. The remainder of the service is nearly the same\r\nas our own.\r\n\r\nThey have removed the objectionable opening of the Marriage Service;\r\nbut, not content with that, they have also removed the whole of the\r\nservice which follows the minister's blessing after the marriage is\r\npronounced, and thus reduced it to a five minutes' ceremony. While on\r\nthis subject, I may as well observe that, from inquiries I made, I\r\nbelieve but few of those marriages take place by which husband and wife\r\nare prevented from kneeling at the same altar, by which their highest\r\ninterests can never be a subject of mutual discussion, and by which\r\nchildren are either brought up without any fixed religious ideas at all,\r\nor else a compromise is entered into, and the girls are educated in one\r\nchurch and the boys in another. In short, I believe the Romanists in\r\nAmerica marry but rarely out of the pale of their own church. I cannot\r\nsay what the law of divorce is, but it appears to offer far greater\r\nfacilities than would be approved of in England. A gentleman mentioned\r\ntwo cases to me, in one of which the divorce was obtained by the wife\r\nwithout the husband being aware of it, although living in the same\r\nState; in the other, the wife returned to the State from which her\r\nhusband had taken her, and there obtained a divorce without his\r\nknowledge.--To return from this digression. In the Visitation of the\r\nSick they have removed that individual absolution of the minister, the\r\nwording of which is so objectionable that, if I am rightly informed, it\r\nis rarely used by ministers in England. In the Burial of the Dead, they\r\nhave changed the two concluding prayers in those sentences which refer\r\nto the deceased. The Commination they have entirely expunged. They have\r\nadded a full service for Visitation of Prisoners, and a Harvest\r\nThanksgiving; and they have provided a form of morning and evening\r\nprayer for families.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing constitute the leading points of difference. Of course\r\nthere are many minor ones which are merely verbal, such, for instance,\r\nas their expunging the scriptural quotation of \"King of kings, Lord of\r\nlords,\" from the prayer for the President, probably out of deference to\r\nthe prejudices of the Republicans, for which omission they have\r\npartially atoned by the substitution of the grander expression of \"only\r\nRuler of the Universe,\" in lieu of the more limited term \"only Ruler of\r\nPrinces.\" To enter into all these verbal changes would be alike tedious\r\nand useless. Enough, I trust, has been written to convey a general idea\r\nof the most striking and interesting points of difference.\r\n\r\nOther churches transplanted to this hemisphere seem to differ from the\r\nparent stock most essentially. Thus I find in the almanack for 1853,\r\n\"Methodist Episcopal Church (North) 3984 ministers, and 662,315\r\ncommunicants,\" and below them \"Methodist Episcopal Church (South)\"\r\nwithout any return of statistics. I regret not being able to give the\r\nreader any history of this occidental hierarchy. I do not even know the\r\nEpiscopacizing process they go through, whether it is entirely lay or\r\nentirely clerical, or whether it is a fusion of the two. At first I\r\nimagined it was a Wesleyan offshoot, but I can find no indication of\r\nthat fact; and, moreover, the Wesleyan is a very small body, numbering\r\n600 ministers and 20,000 communicants. I only allude to it because it\r\nappears to me a totally novel feature in Dissenting bodies--as\r\nunderstood in England. Another curious change produced by this Western\r\nclimate is, that it turns all my Presbyterian friends instrumentally\r\nmusical. I do not remember entering any of their churches without\r\nfinding an organ, and in many instances a very good choir. Although I\r\napprove highly of the euphonious improvement, I feel sure that many of\r\nmy countrymen in the extreme north would rather see a picture\r\nrepresenting Satan in Abraham's bosom inside their kirk than any musical\r\ninstrument. Such is the force of habit and prejudice.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the churches in America have increased is doubtless\r\nmost creditable to the community, when it is remembered that all the\r\nvarious denominations are supported voluntarily. Nor is their number the\r\nonly point worthy of notice: the buildings themselves have all, some\r\necclesiastical appearance, and many of them are fine specimens of\r\narchitecture. Besides which, they are always kept clean and in good\r\norder; you will never find those unsightly barns, and still less the\r\ndilapidation which is often met with in the mother land. I have myself\r\nbeen in a church at home where the flooring was all worn away, and\r\ngravel from the outside substituted, and where the seats were so rickety\r\nthat a fall might be anticipated at any moment. The parishioners were\r\npoor Highlanders, it is true, but the owner of the soil was a man of\r\nconsiderable wealth.\r\n\r\nI have, since my return to England, been into a beautiful old parish\r\nchurch in one of the midland counties; the building was in a most\r\ndeplorable state of dilapidation, and the communion-rail formed a\r\nmusic-stand, while inside were placed an orchestra of two fiddles and a\r\nbass-viol. The minister received, for the first three years he\r\nofficiated, the exorbitant remuneration of thirty pounds a year; since\r\nwhich time he has taken the duties of parish schoolmaster, the salary of\r\nwhich, increased by a small sum from Queen Anne's Bounty, enables him to\r\nkeep body and soul together. But of course the school engrossed all his\r\ntime, except what was necessary to prepare his discourses, and his\r\nparishioners were unavoidably and totally neglected, till dissenting\r\nministers came to the rescue. As a natural consequence, they soon\r\nfollowed the ministers who made them the objects of their care, and when\r\nI attended this beautiful old parish church, the congregation,\r\nindependent of the orchestra and the parish school, consisted of eleven\r\nsouls, three of whom came from the minister's own house. You might seek\r\nin vain to parallel such a case throughout the whole Republic.\r\n\r\nI now propose to make a few observations about disbelief in the United\r\nStates. On this point I have no statistics to refer to, nor do I believe\r\nsuch exist. I therefore can form no idea of its extent; but the open way\r\nin which some parties not only express their doubts of the authenticity\r\nof Scripture, but dispute every doctrine which it contains, and openly\r\nproclaim it the enemy of man, is worthy of some notice. An Ismite\r\nConvention was held for many days at Hartford, in one of the New England\r\nStates (Connecticut) where, I suppose, education may be considered as\r\nuniversal as in any other State in the Union.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was considered of sufficient importance to occupy daily\r\nseveral columns of one of the New York leading journals, and to employ a\r\nspecial reporter. It is thus headed--\"MEETING OF PHILOSOPHERS,\r\nTHEOLOGIANS, THINKERS, STRONG-MINDED WOMEN, SPIRITUAL RAPPERS,\r\nATHEISTS, AND NEGROES.\" Details of this Convention would be too\r\ntedious; I propose only giving a few of their resolutions.\r\nResolved--\"That the Bible, in some parts of the Old and New Testament,\r\nsanctions injustice, concubinage, prostitution, oppression, war,\r\nplunder, and wholesale murder, and, therefore, that the Bible as a\r\nwhole, originated,[CG] is false, and injurious to the social and\r\nspiritual growth of man.\" After which the chairman goes on to prove (?)\r\nit is purely human, &c. Another resolution reiterates the former, and\r\nadds that \"the time has come to declare its untruthfulness, and to\r\nunmask those who are guilty of its imposture.\" Then follows a resolution\r\nfor the especial consideration of slave-owners:--\"Resolved--That it is\r\nthe climax of audacity and impiety for this nation to receive the Bible\r\nas the inspired Word of God, and then to make it a penal offence to give\r\nit to any of the millions who are held as chattel slaves on its soil,\r\nthus conspiring to make them miserable here and hereafter.\" Then follows\r\na charitable resolution, declaring their belief that all the clergy\r\n\"would readily burn the Bible to-morrow if public sentiment demanded\r\nit.\" One of the orators brings the Bible to the bar of geology, and\r\nthere condemns it, and recommends \"that the Hindoos should establish a\r\nmission to enlighten Christians of this and other countries. He believed\r\nthat the priesthood and the Bible were opposed to all liberty and\r\nprogress, and the deadliest enemies of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nAnother member of this blasphemous band becomes highly indignant because\r\nthe orthodox clergymen--who probably remembered that \"evil\r\ncommunications corrupt good manners\"--would not meet them on their\r\ninfidel platform, and he presents a resolution declaring that \"by their\r\nabsence, they had openly declared their infidelity to their professions\r\nof theological faith, and had thus confessed the weakness and folly of\r\ntheir arrogant assumptions, and proved that they loved popular favour\r\nmore than common good; and they are therefore moral cowards, pharisees\r\nof this nineteenth century, seeking to enslave more and more the mind of\r\nman,\" &c. Another orator then proposes a resolution, to the effect that\r\nthe spirit and genius of Bible religion is not a system of salvation\r\nfrom sin and its effects, but a system of damnation into sin and its\r\neffects; that it is the friend of moral and spiritual slavery, and\r\ntherefore \"the foe of human mental and spiritual liberty.\" Subsequently\r\na strong-minded woman, called Mrs. Rose, appeared on the platform amid\r\nconsiderable uproar, followed by extinguishing the gas and singing\r\nsongs. After a severe struggle, the lady managed to express her\r\nsentiments in these mild and Christian terms:--\"The Church is upon your\r\nneck. Do you want to be free? Then trample the Church, the priest, and\r\nthe Bible under your feet.\"--The last day's proceeding closed by a row\r\nin the gallery, owing to a fight, in which a dirk had been drawn; and\r\nthen the Convention adjourned till the following year.\r\n\r\nThe reader must not imagine that I state this as an indication of the\r\ntone of religious feeling in the New England States,--far from it; but\r\nit appears to me a fact worth noticing, that a Convention of such a\r\nnature and magnitude, and considered of sufficient importance to employ\r\nthe special reporter of a leading journal of New York, should by any\r\npossibility assemble for days and days together, and give vent to such\r\nblasphemous sentiments among a people so liberally educated and so amply\r\nsupplied with means of religious instruction. I only hope that the\r\ninfidelity of the whole Republic was gathered into that one assembly,\r\nand that having met in so uncongenial an atmosphere, they all returned\r\nto their homes impregnated with some of the purer atmosphere of the\r\ngreat majority of the people.\r\n\r\nThe subject of Education naturally follows the Church; but, on this\r\npoint, any attempt at accuracy is hopeless. Whether it be from the\r\nvariety of school systems in the different States, or from some innate\r\ndefect in the measures taken to obtain information, I cannot pretend to\r\nsay; but the discrepancies between the statements made are so great,\r\nthat I can only pretend to give a moderate approximation to the truth,\r\nwhich is the more to be regretted, as the means provided for education\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of the Republic constitute one of its\r\nnoblest features. In rough numbers, they may be thus stated:--\r\n\r\n  Schools.               Number.    Instructors.       Pupils.\r\n\r\n  Public                 81,000       92,000          4,000,000\r\n  Colleges                  220         1500             20,000\r\n  Academies, & others     6,000       12,000            261,000\r\n\r\nOf the above colleges, theology claims 44, medicine 37, law 16.\r\n\r\nAmong the expenses of the various colleges, which I can refer to, I find\r\nUniversity College, Virginia--the terms of which occupy 44 weeks--is the\r\nmost expensive. The annual charges for a student are the\r\nfollowing:--College expenses, 40l.; board, 22l.; washing, fuel, and\r\nlights, 4l.--in all, 70l. It is obvious that no provision is here\r\nmade for champagne suppers, hunters, tandems, and other \"necessaries,\"\r\nof our University students, including a few \"auxiliaries,\" in the shape\r\nof I O U's, for red coats, top-boots, Hudson's regalias, and mysterious\r\njewellery bills for articles that men don't wear. Doubtless some papas\r\nwould prefer the Virginian bill of fare; but then, they must remember\r\nthat the republican lads go to college to learn something, whereas many\r\npapas send their first-born hopes to Oxford and Cambridge to save\r\nthemselves trouble, and to keep the youths out of mischief during the\r\nawkward period of life yclept \"hobbledehoyhood.\" How they succeed is\r\npretty well known to themselves, and probably their bankers have some\r\nidea also; yet, with all these drawbacks, who will deny that those seats\r\nof learning turn out annually some of the most manly and high-minded,\r\nand some of the best educated and most industrious, young men in the\r\ncountry?\r\n\r\nHaving entered into some of the details of education at various places\r\nduring my travels, I shall not trespass on the reader's patience by\r\ndwelling further on the subject, except to call attention to the\r\nfollowing important regulation with regard to children in factories; and\r\nI most sincerely hope it may reach the eye of Lord Shaftesbury, or some\r\nother of his coadjutors in the noble work of the protection and\r\neducation of helpless youth. The regulation exists in some shape or\r\nother in many States. I subjoin the wording of it from that of\r\nMassachusetts:--\r\n\r\n_\"No child under the age of fifteen years shall be employed in any\r\nmanufacturing establishment, unless such child shall have attended some\r\npublic or private day-school, where instruction is given by a teacher\r\nqualified according to law to teach orthography, reading, writing,\r\nEnglish grammar, geography, arithmetic, and good behaviour, at least one\r\nterm of eleven weeks of the twelve months next preceding the time of\r\nsuch employment, and for the same period during any and every twelve\r\nmonths in which such child shall be so employed.\"_\r\n\r\nAlthough my salt-fish friends are probably very familiar with\r\nsea-lawyers, the general reader may be astonished to see any allusion to\r\nlaw made by a sea-captain. I therefore beg to inform him, that the\r\nfollowing observations on a most interesting point are furnished me by a\r\nfriend who is legitimately at home in that complicated business, and who\r\ndevoted much attention to the study of the method by which land is\r\nconveyed in the United States with so much ease and so little expense:--\r\n\r\n\"In America all conveyances of land, whether absolute or by way of\r\nmortgage only, are, with the exception of some chattel interests,\r\nrequired to be registered within a fixed or a reasonable time after\r\ntheir execution. Registration is constructive notice to all the world;\r\nif not registered, a deed is only valid against the parties to it and\r\nthe heirs and devisees of the grantor. Generally, however, notice\r\nobtained by a purchaser previous to his purchase, will, if clearly\r\nproved, prevent his taking the advantage, though he may have been\r\nbeforehand in registering his own title.\r\n\r\n\"By the old laws of Massachusetts, all deeds of conveyance were required\r\nto be recorded, 'that neither creditors might be defrauded, nor courts\r\ntroubled with vexatious suits and endless contentions.' In consequence\r\nof the number of registers established in each county--and the\r\nexcellence of their arrangements, no inconvenience results from the\r\naccumulation of deeds, notwithstanding the early period to which they go\r\nback. In register for Suffolk county, Massachusetts, are to be seen\r\ncopies of deeds from 1640 down to the present time. They are bound up in\r\n640 volumes, and do not as yet take up much space. They have lately\r\nmultiplied in an increasing ratio, the volumes having risen from 250 to\r\ntheir present number in the last 25 years.\r\n\r\n\"The register for Philadelphia county, Pennsylvania, contains within a\r\nmoderate compass deeds from 1683 downwards. They are referred to by\r\nindices on the following plan: All deeds made within a certain time, and\r\nin which the name of the grantor commences with the same letter of the\r\nalphabet, are bound up in one volume; thus, a volume marked \"H\r\n1820-1847,\" contains all deeds executed between those years by grantors\r\nwhose names begin with H. One index volume contains the names of all\r\ngrantors between those years in alphabetical order, another that of all\r\ngrantees, and both refer to volume and page of the books of deeds. A\r\nthird index gives the names of grantors and grantees, arranged\r\nchronologically, according to the year in which the deed they were\r\nparties to was executed.\r\n\r\n\"The original deed remain in the possession of the proprietors, but are\r\nof secondary importance. They are written in a plain, legible hand on\r\npaper, parchment being seldom used. The signatures of the parties are of\r\ncourse requisite; but the seal, which is essential to a deed in England,\r\nis in many States dispensed with. The custom of registering obviates the\r\nnecessity for those long recitals that so swell out an English\r\nconveyance, and the shortest possible forms of covenants are preferred.\r\nThe American conveyance only witnesses that the grantor conveys the\r\nproperty therein described, which, or part of which, was conveyed to him\r\nby such a one by a deed of such a date, and a marginal note states the\r\nvolume and page where the deed thus mentioned is to be seen.\r\n\r\n\"The advantages of registration are,--greater security of title, and\r\nbrevity and economy in conveyances. The example of the United States\r\nshows that there is nothing in the Anglo-Saxon laws of real property to\r\nrender such a system impracticable. Several of the most eminent lawyers\r\nin Boston declared, that their registration was found to work easily and\r\nsafely; the only change desired was by a few, who expressed a wish that\r\nmore registers should be established, as, one for every district,\r\ninstead of for every county. They all expressed their astonishment that\r\na similar plan had not long ago been adopted in England. They admitted\r\nthat dealings with property were more simple in America, where strict\r\nsettlements are either not allowed, or not generally in use, but\r\nmaintained that the real obstacles to a registration in this country\r\nlie not so much in the difficulty of carrying it out, as in the\r\nprejudices of landowners, the self-interest of lawyers, and the\r\nsuperstitious dread entertained by John Bull generally of anything to\r\nwhich he is unaccustomed.\"[CH]\r\n\r\nI am no lawyer, as I observed before, and therefore I do not pretend to\r\npass an opinion on the details of the foregoing remarks; but of the\r\nresults produced by their system, I certainly can speak, for I have seen\r\nproperty transferred without the slightest trouble, and for a few\r\nshillings, which, owing to the amount involved, and the complications\r\nconnected with it, would, if transferred in this country, have kept the\r\nfirm of Screw, Skinflint, and Stickem hard at work for mouths, and when\r\nfinished, would have required a week to make up the bill of costs, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote CG: I suppose originated _from the Deity_ is\r\nintended.--H.A.M.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote CH: Communicated to me by Mr. J.G. Dodson, son of the Right\r\nHonourable Sir J. Dodson, Dean of the Arches, &c.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n_Inventions and Inveighings.--Palquam qui meruit ferat._\r\n\r\n\r\nWriting about law makes one litigious; so I seize this opportunity for\r\nmaking a few observations on American claims. I am not going to open the\r\nquestion of the Bay of Fundy, &c., fisheries; because British liberality\r\nhas resigned a right, the retention of which was a source of continual\r\nirritation to our republican neighbours. I must, however, quote a few\r\nlines from the work of their able Chancellor, Kent, to show how fully\r\njustified we were in claiming the sovereignty of the Bay of Fundy. If\r\nthe Chancellor's work on the Law of Nations is consulted, it will be\r\nfound that he points out to his countrymen their right to the\r\nsovereignty of lines stretching \"from Cape Anne to Cape Cod, Nantucket\r\nto Montauck Point, thence to the Capes of the Delaware, and _from the\r\nSouth Cape of Florida to the Mississippi.\"_ With such wholesale claims\r\nasserted on their part, it would require something more than modest\r\nassurance to dispute England's right to the Bay of Fundy. But my\r\nlitigation with the Republic is respecting some of their claims to\r\ninventions, which they put forward in so barefaced a manner, that the\r\nunwary or the uninquiring--which two sections of the human family\r\nconstitute the great majority--are constantly misled into a belief of\r\ntheir truth; and the citizens of the Republic would do well to remember,\r\nthat by putting forward unwarrantable pretensions to some discoveries,\r\nthey afford just grounds for questioning their lawful claims to others.\r\n\r\nThe first I shall mention is with reference to Fulton and steam. Mr.\r\nCharles King, the President of Columbia College, in a lecture delivered\r\nbefore the Mechanics' Institute, Broadway, New York, in December, 1851,\r\nclaims for Fulton \"the application of a known force _in a new manner,\r\nand to new and before unthought-of purposes_.\" Now what are the real\r\nfacts? James Watt, in 1769, patented the double-acting engine, which\r\nwas the first step by which the steam-engine was made capable of being\r\nused to propel a vessel. In 1780, James Pickard patented what is no\r\nother than the present connecting rod and crank, and a fly-wheel, the\r\nsecond and last great improvement in the steam-engine, which enabled it\r\nto be of service in propelling vessels.[CI] In 1785, William Symington\r\ntook out a patent, by which he obtained, with economy of fuel, a more\r\nperfect method of condensation of steam and a more perfect vacuum.\r\n\r\nIn 1787, Mr. Miller, of Dalswinton, a gentleman who had spent a fortune\r\nof nearly 30,000l. in ship-building experiments, was urged by Mr.\r\nTaylor to try and apply the power of steam to vessels. William Symington\r\nwas applied to, with the view of knowing if he could apply his engine to\r\none of Mr. Miller's boats, which he accordingly did, and propelled a\r\nlittle pleasure vessel on the lake at Dalswinton, at the rate of five\r\nmiles an hour, on the 14th November, 1788. In the following year, Mr.\r\nSymington made a double engine for a boat to be tried upon the Forth and\r\nClyde Canal; and in the month of December, 1789, this trial-vessel was\r\npropelled at the rate of six and a half miles an hour. Lord Dundas, who\r\nwas a large proprietor in the Forth and Clyde Canal, employed Symington\r\nto make experiments in 1801. The result of these trials was the\r\nconstruction of the \"Charlotte Dundas,\" the first practical steam-boat\r\never built. The engines of this vessel combined the patents before\r\nmentioned of Watt, Pickard, and Symington, which combinations--made by\r\nthe latter patentee--constitute the present system of steam navigation.\r\nThe \"Charlotte Dundas\" made her trial trip in March, 1802, and so\r\nsatisfactory was the trial, that the Duke of Bridgewater ordered eight\r\nboats of Symington, for the purpose of running on his canal. The Duke of\r\nBridgewater died immediately after; and the Forth and Clyde proprietors,\r\nowing to the injury caused to the banks, discontinued the use of the\r\nboat. The foregoing observations prove that if any one individual can\r\nclaim the merit of inventing the steam-engine, that man is William\r\nSymington, who, combining previous inventions with his own patent,\r\nconstructed the engine as at present in use. At the same time, every\r\ncredit is due to Mr. Miller, who first afforded Symington the\r\nopportunity of putting his ingenuity to the test.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUDSON RIVER STEAMER.]\r\n\r\nLet us now look at Mr. Fulton's part in the transaction. In 1801 he\r\nvisited Scotland, and was present at one of the experiments making by\r\nSymington on the canal, and from him he obtained permission to make full\r\nsketches and notes of both boat and apparatus. The fact is sworn to on\r\noath of the presence of an American gentleman, who called himself Mr.\r\nFulton, during the experiments; and further evidence is found in the\r\nfact that the engines he ordered of Messrs. Boulton and Watt for the\r\n\"Clermont\" were precisely of the same dimensions as those in the\r\n\"Charlotte Dundas,\" with the exception of two inches more diameter in\r\nthe piston; and the patent of Fulton dates from 1809--twenty years after\r\nSymington had propelled a boat by steam on Lake Dalswinton, and eight\r\nyears after he had himself taken sketches of Symington's engines in the\r\nForth and Clyde canal-boat.\r\n\r\nBeyond the foregoing evidence, there is the testimony of Mr. Bell that,\r\nat Fulton's request, he sent him information, plans, &c., of Mr.\r\nMiller's first experiments. The long and the short of the story is\r\nclearly this:--Mr. Fulton was a shrewd and clever engineer. He came to\r\nEngland, copied the steam-engine which Symington had combined--one can\r\nhardly say invented--and then returned to his own country, and applied\r\nit successfully, for which the Republic ought to be thankful to him, and\r\nto honour his name; but, for a president of a college lecturing before a\r\nmechanics' society, to call Fulton the inventor \"of applying a known\r\nforce _in a new manner and to new and before unthought-of purposes,\"_\r\nexhibits an ignorance or an assurance, for neither of which the\r\nslightest excuse can be made.[CJ]\r\n\r\n\r\nWith equal accuracy Mr. King informs the mechanics that \"Colonel John\r\nStevens had clearly worked out in his own mind, long before any\r\nlocomotive was constructed in Europe, the theory of such an application\r\nof steam, and the actual form in which it could be advantageously made,\r\nas well as the cost of constructing and working a railway for the use of\r\nlocomotives.\" If this were true, how does it happen that the son of the\r\nColonel, an able and ingenious mechanician, came over to George\r\nStephenson, at Liverpool, to learn what he was doing, and to order\r\nengines from him; but Mr. King out-herods Herod, for he claims on behalf\r\nof the Colonel, the working of Steam expansively in 1815, for which Watt\r\nhad taken out a patent thirty-five years before. If presidents of\r\ncolleges in America cannot in their lectures deal more closely with\r\nfacts, the instruction given within the walls of the college will come\r\nunder very unfavourable suspicions.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I will only add a few remarks as to ocean steamers, on\r\nwhich subject, as on the invention of the engine, there is considerable\r\ndifficulty in awarding the honours to any single individual. The\r\nAmericans were the first to employ steamers along the coast, and the\r\n\"Savannah,\" built by them in 1819, was the first vessel that crossed the\r\nocean employing steam in any way as an assistant. But in her the steam\r\nwas a very small auxiliary power, and upon the sails the vessel mainly\r\ndepended. She cannot, therefore, fairly be called an ocean steamer. The\r\n\"Enterprise,\" a vessel of 500 tons burden, with two 120 horse-power\r\nengines, started from London for Calcutta, touching at the Cape of Good\r\nHope, about the year 1826; and may be fairly considered as the first\r\nvessel that made an ocean journey essentially dependent on steam.\r\nSubsequently the \"Royal William,\" built at Quebec, after running between\r\nthat port and Halifax from 1831 to 1833, started in the fall of the\r\nlatter year for Falmouth; and to her belongs the honour of being the\r\nfirst _bonâ fide_ paddle-wheel steamer that crossed the Atlantic. She\r\nwas afterwards sold to the Portuguese government, and fitted up as a\r\nman-of-war steamer, under the name of the \"Doña Isabella.\"\r\n\r\nIf, however, it be asked, where oceanic communication took its rise,\r\nunquestionably that honour belongs to Bristol and the \"Great Western,\" a\r\nsteamer of 210 feet in length, 1240 tons, fitted with two engines of 210\r\nhorse-power each. This vessel started on the 8th of March, 1838, under\r\nthe command of Captain Hosken, reached New York in thirteen days ten\r\nhours, and made the return passage in fifteen days. Since that date\r\nocean steamers and steam companies have risen up like mushrooms. England\r\nand America have established a kind of weekly Derby, Cunard entering one\r\nhorse and Collins the other. Unquestionably the Americans have been\r\npioneers in improving the build, and a rivalry has sprung up which is as\r\nuseful as it is honourable.\r\n\r\nThe English boats adhere to a greater proportion of sail, in case of\r\naccidents to the engine; the Americans carry less sail than we do, for\r\nthe sake of increasing the speed. As to relative comfort on board the\r\ntwo boats, an American gentleman, who had made several voyages, told me\r\nthe only difference he ever discovered was, the same as exists between\r\nthe hotels of the respective countries.--To return to litigation.\r\n\r\nAnother claim frequently set up in America is the invention of the\r\ntelegraph. Even in the Census Report--which I suppose may be considered\r\na Government work--I read the following:--\"It is to American ingenuity\r\nthat we owe the practical application of the telegraph. While the honour\r\nis due to Professor Morse for the practical application and successful\r\nprosecution of the telegraph, it is mainly owing to the researches and\r\ndiscoveries of Professor Henry, and other scientific Americans, that he\r\nwas enabled to perfect so valuable an invention.\" It is difficult to\r\nconceive a more unblushing piece of effrontery than the foregoing\r\nsentence, which proclaims throughout the Union that the electric\r\ntelegraph in its practical working is the invention of one American, and\r\nin its scientific details the invention of other Americans, neither of\r\nwhich assertions has truth for its basis, and consequently the\r\nsuperstructure is a fiction--the only available excuse for which would\r\nbe, that the writer had never heard of what was going on in Europe. Had\r\nhe taken the least trouble to inquire into the subject before he wrote,\r\nhe never would--it is to be hoped--have so grossly deceived his\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nHe might have easily ascertained that such men as Oersted, Ampère,\r\nArago, Sturgeon, had mastered in detail the various scientific\r\ndifficulties that stood in the way of the accomplishment of the\r\nlong-desired object; and he might also have known that Cooke in England\r\nand Stienhiel in Germany had both overcome the practical difficulties\r\nbefore Professor Morse had enlightened the Republic with his system,\r\nwhich--like Bain's--is simply another method of producing the same\r\nresult--i.e., telegraphic communication.\r\n\r\nMr. Cooke took out his patent in conjunction with Professor Wheatstone,\r\nwhose attention had long been turned to this subject, and whose name has\r\nbeen so much before the public, that not a few persons attribute the\r\ntelegraph to him exclusively. There was, indeed, some dispute between\r\nthem as to their respective claims, and the matter was referred to Sir\r\nI. Brunel and Professor Daniell for arbitration. The burden of their\r\ndecision was, that Mr. Cooke was entitled to stand alone as the\r\ngentleman to whom Great Britain is indebted for having practically\r\nintroduced and carried out the telegraph as a useful undertaking;\r\nProfessor Wheatstone's profound and successful researches having already\r\nprepared the public to receive it.--So much for the justice of the\r\nAmerican claim to the invention, which, like steam, has been the produce\r\nof many heads, and was brought into practical use first by Cooke, then\r\nby Stienhiel in Germany, and lastly by Morse in America.\r\n\r\nAnother invention of which the public have heard no little discussion\r\nlately is the reaping machine. To the American nation doubtless belongs\r\nthe credit of forcing it into notice and into use; but as for any claim\r\nto the invention, it is equally certain they have none. That honour is\r\ndue solely to the Rev. Patrick Bell, a Scotch minister in the presbytery\r\nof Arbroath. He first tried his reaping machine in August, 1828, at his\r\nfather's farm on Lord Airlie's estate, where it has been in yearly use\r\never since; and in October he exhibited it at the Highland Society's\r\nmeeting at Glasgow. The principle upon which his first machine was made\r\ndiffers in nothing from those making at this hour; and, as some of the\r\npeople employed on his father's farm migrated to America, it is only\r\nreasonable to suppose they carried sufficient information with them to\r\nexplain the machine. American ingenuity soon copied, and American energy\r\nsoon gave an impulse to, Mr. Bell's machine, for which, though denying\r\nthem the invention, we ought not to deny them our thanks.\r\n\r\nBut while I thus explain the unwarrantable claims which Americans have\r\nset forth, I must not allow John Bull to lay the flattering unction to\r\nhis soul that none of his claimed discoveries are disputed on the other\r\nside of the Atlantic, I have seen a _Book of Facts_ printed in America,\r\nwhich charges us with more than one geographical robbery in the Arctic\r\nSeas, in which regions, it is well known, American enterprise and\r\nsympathy have been most nobly employed. As I am incapable of balancing\r\nthe respective claims, I leave that subject to the Hydrographer's office\r\nof the two countries.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of the Republic have but little idea of the injurious\r\neffects which the putting forward unwarrantable claims has upon their\r\njust claims. I have now before me a letter from a seafaring man who has\r\nspent a quarter of a century upon the borders of the United States; he\r\nis writing on the subject of their claims to the invention of steam, and\r\nhe winds up in these words:--\"They are with this, as they are with\r\nevery other thing to which either merit or virtue is attached--the sole\r\nand only proprietors and originators, and say both the one and the other\r\nare unknown out of the universal Yankee nation.\" I do not endorse the\r\nsentiment, but I quote it to show the effect produced on some minds by\r\nthe unfounded claims they have put forward.\r\n\r\nThey have ingenuity and invention enough legitimately belonging to them\r\nfor any nation to be justly proud of, without plucking peacock's\r\nfeathers from others, and sending them throughout the length and breadth\r\nof the Republic as the plumage of the American eagle. How many useful\r\ninventions have they not made in machinery for working wood? Is not\r\nEngland daily importing some new improvement therein from the American\r\nshores? Look again at their perfect and beautiful invention for the\r\nmanufacture of seamless bags, by Mr. Cyrus Baldwin, and which he has at\r\nwork at the Stark Mills. There are 126 looms in operation, all\r\nself-acting and each one making 47 bags daily; the bags are a little\r\nmore than three and a half feet long, and chiefly used, I believe, for\r\nflour and grain. When they are finished, sewing-machines are at hand,\r\nwhich can hem at the rate of 650 bags each daily. This same gentleman\r\nhas also adapted his looms to the making hoses for water, of which he\r\ncan complete 1000 feet a day by the experimental loom now in use, and it\r\nis more than probable these hoses will entirely supersede the use of the\r\nleather ones, being little more than one-tenth the price, and not\r\nrequiring any expense to keep in order.\r\n\r\nAnother and very important purpose to which their ingenuity has applied\r\nmachinery is, the manufacture of fire-arms. It has long been a matter of\r\nsurprise to me, why so obvious and useful an application of machinery\r\nwas neglected by the Government at home. The advantages of being able to\r\ntransfer all screws, springs, nipples, hammers, &c., from one musket to\r\nanother, are so manifest to the most infantine comprehension, that I\r\nsuppose they considered it beneath their notice; nor can I make out that\r\nthey have duly inquired into the various breech-loading systems used in\r\nthe States, some of which they have been testing in their Navy for\r\nyears. As, however, we are beginning to copy their application of\r\nmachinery, I dare say the next generation will take up the question of\r\nbreech-loading arms.\r\n\r\nA few observations on the Militia appear to follow naturally after\r\nremarks on fire-arms. According to the most reliable information which I\r\nhave been able to obtain, every able-bodied male between 18 and 40 years\r\nof age is liable to militia service. Those who do not serve are subject\r\nto a fine, varying in different States, from 3s. upwards; which sum\r\nhelps to pay those who do duty. The pay of a private while on duty is\r\nabout 10s. a-day, and that of officers in proportion. Formerly, they\r\nonly turned out two days in the year; now I believe, they generally turn\r\nout ten, and in some of the cities twenty, days annually. The persons\r\nexcused from militia service, are the clergy, medical men, fire\r\ncompanies, and those who have held a commission for three years. Each\r\nregiment settles its own uniform; and it is a strange sight to see\r\ncompanies in French, German, and Highland uniforms, all marching gaily\r\nthrough the streets.\r\n\r\nThe day of firing at a mark is quite a fête; they parade the town, with\r\nthe target untouched, on their road to the ground: there they commence\r\nfiring, at 100 yards; if the bull's-eye be not sufficiently riddled,\r\nthey get closer and closer, until, perforated and in shreds, it scarce\r\nhangs together as they return through the town bearing it aloft in\r\ntriumph, and followed by all the washed, half-washed, and unwashed\r\naspirants to military glory.\r\n\r\nI believe the good sense of the people is endeavouring to break through\r\nthe system of nationalizing the companies into French, German, Highland,\r\n&c., believing that keeping up such distinctions is more calculated to\r\nproduce discord than harmony. How long it will be before they succeed in\r\neradicating these separate nationalities, I cannot pretend to say.\r\n\r\nWith respect to their numbers, I cannot give any accurate information.\r\n_The American Almanack_--generally a very useful source of\r\ninformation--puts them down at 2,202,113; which is evidently a little\r\nbit of Buncombe, as those figures represent very nearly the whole\r\nable-bodied men in the Republic between the ages of 18 and 40. As they\r\nare liable to be called on, the _Almanack_ puts them down as though\r\nregularly enrolled; their real numbers I leave to the fertility of the\r\nimagination. In the same authority, I find the officers calculated at\r\n76,920, of which 765 are generals. These numbers, I imagine, must also go\r\nthrough a powerful process of subtraction before the exact truth would\r\nbe arrived at, although I believe there are twice 765 citizens who enjoy\r\nthe titular honour.\r\n\r\nOne fact, however, is beyond doubt; they have a large militia,\r\naccustomed to, and fond of, using fire-arms; and those who feel disposed\r\nto approach their shores with hostile intentions, will find the old\r\nScotch motto applicable to them in its fullest sense,--\r\n\r\n\"Nemo me impune lacessit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote CI: The Marquis de Jouffroy is said to have worked a boat by\r\nsteam on the Seine in 1781; but the Revolution breaking out, he appears\r\nto have been unable to complete his invention.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote CJ: The foregoing details are essentially extracted from a\r\nwork by Mr. Woodcroft, professor of machinery at University College,\r\nLondon; who, after proving that the previous inventions of his\r\ncountrymen were combined together, for the first time, in the boat\r\nengined by Symington, thus clearly and summarily disposes of the\r\npretensions put forward in favour of Fulton:--\"In fact, if these\r\ninventions separately, or as a combination, were removed out of Fulton's\r\nboat, nothing would be left but the hull; and if the hull could then be\r\ndivested of that peculiarity of form, admitted to have been derived from\r\nColonel Beaufoy's experiments, _all that would remain would be the hull\r\nof a boat of ordinary construction.\"_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n_Adverse Influences._\r\n\r\n\r\nI now come to the consideration of the annual celebration of the 4th\r\nJuly, an event which presents itself to my mind under two opposite\r\naspects, the one beneficial, the other injurious. If contemplated as a\r\nnation's grateful acknowledgment to Providence for the successful\r\ntermination of an arduous struggle for independence, it assumes an\r\naspect at once dignified and Christian; but if into its celebration\r\nother elements enter which are calculated to nourish hostile feelings\r\ntowards those who have long ceased to reciprocate such unworthy\r\nsentiments, in that case I think its aspect may be fairly termed both\r\ninjurious and unchristian.\r\n\r\nLet me then call your attention to the method of celebration. It\r\nconsists of three parts:--First, the reading of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence; secondly, an oration on the subject; lastly, procession\r\nand jollification.\r\n\r\nNow what is the Declaration of Independence? It is a document which\r\ndetails their views of the oppression and injustice which justified\r\ntheir rebellion against the mother country. The clauses are too numerous\r\nto quote in full, but I subjoin a few, that the reader may form his own\r\nopinion. Speaking of the sovereign of Great Britain, they say he has\r\nprotected \"armed troops among us, by a mock trial, from punishment for\r\nany murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these States.\r\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and\r\ndestroyed the lives of our people. He is, at this time, transporting\r\nlarge armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death,\r\ndesolation, and tyranny, already begun, with circumstances of cruelty\r\nand perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally\r\nunworthy the head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our\r\nfellow-citizens taken captive on the high seas, to bear arms against\r\ntheir country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren,\r\nor to fall themselves by their hands. He has excited domestic\r\ninsurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the\r\ninhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian savages, whose known\r\nrule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes,\r\nand conditions. In every stage of these oppressions, we have petitioned\r\nfor redress in the most humble terms; our repeated petitions have been\r\nanswered only by repeated injury. A prince whose character is thus\r\nmarked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler\r\nof a free people.\"\r\n\r\nI pause not to ask if any of these charges are correct or not: grant\r\nthem accuracy in every statement, nay more, admit that they were\r\neminently calculated to stir up the feelings of the colonists, and to\r\ninflame that spirit which was requisite to make their struggle for\r\nindependence justifiable and successful, and that they were therefore\r\ncalled for by the emergencies of the day;--but nearly eighty years have\r\nrolled over since that Declaration was penned; there is no success\r\nsought for now which renders such appeals necessary, and surely it is\r\nnot for the purpose of justifying their rebellion that they are made.\r\nWhere then is the good to be derived from such declarations? Is there\r\nany misgiving in the Republic as to sentiments of patriotism or pluck?\r\nSurely none. But who can help seeing the evil to which they lead? These\r\nannual recapitulations of old grievances, buried beneath nearly a\r\ncentury, must tend to excite hostile feelings towards England. Conceive\r\nfor one moment France reading annually a declaration of independence\r\nfrom British arms on the anniversary of their recapture of Calais, and\r\nengrossing in that document every injustice or atrocity which the\r\nEnglish perpetrated during their rule; not to mention the undignified\r\nnature of such a course, who can doubt that it would be pre-eminently\r\ncalculated to generate those hostile feelings which it is the bounden\r\nduty of all civilized States to allay? In short, what does it so much\r\nresemble as the system by which, in barbarous days long since past, the\r\nHighland clans used to perpetuate their feuds. If a Christian community\r\ncannot glory in and commemorate national independence without such\r\nadjuncts, such a ceremony would, in my humble opinion, be more honoured\r\nin the breach than in the observance.\r\n\r\nAmong other pernicious influences, I should mention that the Irish\r\ncelebrate the battle of the Boyne annually in order to prevent their\r\nnational angry passions from subsiding. Not the least curious features\r\nin these same Paddies is the fact that, while cursing England for her\r\ntreatment of Ireland, they all unite as one man in favour of Slavery.\r\nMr. Mitchell, the escaped convict, is said to have expressed his opinion\r\nthat a plantation on the Alabama river with fifty sleek slaves, was the\r\n_beau idéal_ of a terrestrial paradise. If he be a bachelor, and still\r\nentertain the same sentiments, I would recommend him to take \"The\r\nstewardess of the Lady Franklin\" as the sharer of his joys.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the orations pronounced, the one I heard at Geneseo had\r\nnothing that struck me as in any way lending itself to those feelings I\r\nhave so freely censured; but it is not always so. I have before me now\r\nan epitome of a speech made by the Honourable D.S. Dickenson, at\r\nSyracuse, on July 4th, 1853. Being an honourable, it is not unfair to\r\nsuppose him--mind, I say to suppose him--a man of superior attainment,\r\nselected by a well-educated people. The epitome is headed \"Vigorous\r\nDiscussion and Patriotic Sentiments.\" I only quote one passage, which I\r\ncould almost fancy Matthew Ward, the hero of the Louisville school-room,\r\nhad written; it runs thus--\"The eloquent orator then went on for nearly\r\nhalf an hour in a strain of withering sarcasm and invective, exposing\r\nthe shameless and wicked oppressions of England in her collieries, in\r\nher factories, in her oppression of Ireland; denouncing her as a nation\r\nwhose history was written in oppression and blood (_great\r\napplause_.)\"--It is difficult to believe that the chosen representative\r\nof an intelligent community should thus speak of that nation to which\r\nhis own country is indebted for nearly every valuable institution she\r\npossesses; but when such ridiculous vituperation is received with shouts\r\nof applause from the gaping rowdies who throng around him, does it not\r\nclearly demonstrate the truth of my previous statements as to the\r\neffects which the celebration of the 4th of July, as now observed, may\r\nnaturally lead to? I say, may lead to, because I would fain hope, for\r\nthe sake of the credit and dignity of the Republic, that such\r\ndisreputable orations are rare exceptions.\r\n\r\nBut that such feelings of aversion to the mother country are generated\r\namong the masses, is proved indirectly in another quarter--viz.,\r\nCongress. During the debate on the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, a Mr. Douglas,\r\nto whom I have before alluded, and who may be considered as the\r\nrepresentative of the rabid and rowdy portion of the community, thus\r\nexpresses himself with regard to England: \"It is impossible she can love\r\nus,--I do not blame her for not loving us,--sir, we have wounded her\r\nvanity and humbled her pride,--she can never forgive us. But for us, she\r\nwould be the first Power on the face of the earth,--but for us, she\r\nwould have the prospect of maintaining that proud position which she\r\nheld for so long a period. We are in her way. She is jealous of us; and\r\njealousy forbids the idea of friendship. England does not love us; she\r\ncannot love us, and we cannot love her either. We have some things in\r\nthe past to remember that are not agreeable. She has more in the present\r\nto humiliate her that she cannot forgive.\"--After which expressions, the\r\npoor little man, as though he had not the slightest conception of the\r\nmeaning of the words he was using, adds the following sentence,\r\ndeprecating all he had previously uttered: \"I do not wish to administer\r\nto the feeling of jealousy and rivalry that exists between us and\r\nEngland. I wish to soften and smooth it down as much as possible.\"\r\n\r\nOn a subsequent occasion, Mr. Butler, senator for South Carolina, who\r\nhonestly did deprecate such language as the foregoing, referred, by way\r\nof contrast, to the many constitutional principles the Republic had\r\nderived from England, and also to the valuable literature which she had\r\nproduced, and by which the Republic had benefited. Upon which, poor Mr.\r\nDouglas got furious, and asserted, that \"Every English book circulated\r\ncontains lurking and insidious slanders and libels upon the character of\r\nour people and the institutions and policy of our Government.\"--He then\r\ndiscovered that abolitionism began, in England, and that \"she keeps her\r\nmissionaries perambulating this country, delivering lectures and\r\nscattering abroad incendiary publications, designed to excite\r\nprejudices, hate, and strife between the different sections of the\r\nUnion.\"--He then, with Illinois truthfulness, hints at _Uncle Tom's\r\nCabin_, as though it were English literature, and which, he says, \"is\r\ndesigned to stir up treason and insurrection around his--Mr.\r\nButler's--fireside,\" &c.--He returns to the charge, and asserts, with\r\nequal accuracy, \"Millions are being expended to distribute _Uncle Tom's\r\nCabin_ throughout the world, with the view of combining the fanaticism,\r\nignorance, and hatred of all the nations of the earth in a common\r\ncrusade against the peculiar institutions of the State and section of\r\nthis Union represented by the senator from South Carolina.\" One might\r\nalmost imagine that the copy of Webster's Dictionary, which Mr. Douglas\r\nhas in his library--if he possess such a thing--has omitted an old\r\nEnglish word, spelt T R U T H.\r\n\r\nBut the point I wish to call the reader's especial attention to, is,\r\nthat the little senator's rabid rhapsody was received with shouts of\r\ngallery applause, which, as I have before observed, is an exhibition of\r\nsentiment not allowed in the Senate to either members of Congress or\r\ngallery. Yet, so thoroughly had he expressed the feelings of the said\r\nrowdies, that they could not resist the unlawful burst of approval. Mr.\r\nButler of course replied to his absurd arguments; but my object is not\r\ndiscussion. I only allude to the subject at all for the purpose of\r\nproving my previous assertion, that within the walls of Congress itself,\r\nelements calculated to engender feelings of animosity towards Great\r\nBritain are to be found at work. It is this deep-seated consciousness of\r\nguilt that makes that portion of the citizens of the Republic so\r\nsensitive with regard to the observations which proceed from this\r\ncountry. Americans like Mr. Butler, who maintain the dignity of their\r\ncountry without descending to paltry popularity-hunting calumny, can\r\nafford to read any criticisms which may come from across the water with\r\nas much calmness as American remarks are read here. Such men have no\r\naccusing conscience gnawing at their vitals. If the population of the\r\ntwo countries were fed upon Judge Douglas's venomous diet, ere long,\r\nlike the Kilkenny cats, nothing but the tails would be left.\r\n\r\nI have felt it imperative to make these remarks, that my countrymen may\r\nunderstand why they so constantly find the strongest symptoms of\r\nhostility to England in a certain class of American writers. Even in the\r\ntext-books for children, you can detect the same animus working. Miss\r\nWillard, in her _History of the United States_, narrates that six Indian\r\nchiefs came to Colonel Washington, the grandfather of the founder of\r\nthe Republic, to treat for peace. The treachery to, and cold-blooded\r\nmurder of, these poor Indians she disposes of thus:--\"He _wrongfully_\r\nput them to death.\" General Clinton's conduct, in the prosecution of his\r\nduties to his country, which never displayed any such revolting act, she\r\ndescribes as reviving in a civilized age \"_barbarous atrocities_.\"--Take\r\nanother instance of amiable sentiments towards England, as exhibited by\r\nthe Common Council of New York, who voted 200l. to entertain John\r\nMitchell, the convict who had escaped from custody. The Mayor addresses\r\nhim in the following terms:--\"When, sir, you were silenced by restraint,\r\noverpowered by brutal force, and foreign bayonets were employed on your\r\nown soil to suppress truth and to bind upon your limbs and mind the\r\nshackles of slavery, we sympathized with you in your adversity. We hated\r\nthe tyrant and loved the victim. And when, sir, after the semblance of a\r\ntrial, you were condemned and hurried as a felon from your home, your\r\ncountry, and your friends, to a distant land, we were filled with\r\nindignation, and pledged a deeper hatred towards the enemies of\r\nman.\"--Mr. Mitchell, in reply, confesses himself from earliest youth a\r\ntraitor to his country, and honours the British Government with the\r\nfollowing epithets: \"I say to them that they are not a government at\r\nall, but a gang of conspirators, of robbers, of murderers.\" These\r\nsentiments were received by the multitude around with \"great applause.\"\r\nConsidering how many causes for exciting ill-will exist, the only wonder\r\nis that, when so large a portion of the Republicans are utterly ignorant\r\nof the truth as regards England, the feeling is not more hostile.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to assert, that the feelings of jealousy and animosity\r\nascribed to England by Mr. Douglas, exist only in the disordered\r\nimagination of his own brain and of those of the deluded gulls who\r\nfollow in his train: for I am proud to say no similar undignified and\r\nantagonistic elements are at work here; and, if any attempt were made to\r\nintroduce them, the good sense of the country would unite with one voice\r\nto cry them down. I defy all the educated, ignorant, or rabid population\r\nof the Republic to bring forward any instance where, either in the\r\ncelebration of any ceremony, the orations of any senator, or the\r\nmeetings of any corporation, such unworthy and contemptible animosity\r\ntowards the United States has ever been shadowed forth.\r\n\r\nI must not, however, allow the reader to understand from the foregoing\r\nremark that there is an universal national antipathy to England;\r\nalthough, whenever she is brought into juxtaposition with the Republic,\r\nit may appear very strongly developed. The most erroneous impressions\r\nwere at the time this was written, abroad among my countrymen, in\r\nrespect of American sympathies with Russia. Filibusteros, rabid\r\nannexationists, inveterate Slaveholders, and Rowdies of every class, to\r\nwhich might have been added a few ignoble minds who made the grave of\r\nconscience a \"stump\" from which to pour forth Buncombe speeches to catch\r\nephemeral popularity, constituted the body in America who sympathised\r\nwith Russia. All the intelligence of the North, and a great portion of\r\nthat of the South, felt the deepest interest in our success, not merely\r\nas descendants of the mother country, but also because they recognised\r\nthe war in which we were engaged as a struggle in the cause of liberty.\r\nWe could not suffer ourselves to be deceived by the Filibustero Press,\r\nnor by the accounts we read of vessels laden with arms carrying them to\r\nRussia. Those were no more proofs of the national feeling, than the\r\nbuilding of slave-clippers every year at Baltimore is a proof that the\r\nnation wishes to encourage the slave-trade. The true feeling of a nation\r\nmust be sought for far deeper than in the superficial clamour of\r\npolitical demagogues, backed though it be by the applause of gaping\r\ncrowds whose worst passions are pandered to for the sake of a transient\r\nbreath of popularity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n_Olla Podrida._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preceding observations lead naturally to a few observations upon\r\nAmerican character in a national point of view; for in treating of so\r\nexceedingly varied a community, combining as it does nearly every nation\r\nof the Old World, it would be beyond the limits of a work like this to\r\nenter into details on so complicated a subject.\r\n\r\nAs I prefer commencing with the objectionable points, and winding up\r\nwith the more favourable, I shall first name Vanity as a great national\r\nfeature. The fulsome adulation with which the Press bespatters its\r\nreaders, throughout the length and breadth of the Union, wherever any\r\ncomparisons are drawn with other nations, is so great that the masses\r\nhave become perfectly deluded; and being so far removed from the nations\r\nof the Old World, and knowing, consequently, nothing of them except\r\nthrough the columns of a vanity-feeding Press, they receive the most\r\nexaggerated statements as though they were Gospel truths--little aware\r\nhow supremely ridiculous the vaunting which they read with delight makes\r\nthem appear in the eyes of other people.\r\n\r\nI insert the following extract from the Press, as one instance among\r\nmany of the vain and ridiculous style of some of their editorial\r\nleaders. It is taken from the _New York Herald_--one of the most\r\nwidely-circulated papers in the Union, but one which, I am bound in\r\njustice to say, is held in contempt[CK] by the more intelligent portion\r\nof the community. Speaking of Mrs. B. Stowe's reception in England, he\r\nsays:--\"She proves herself quite an American in her intercourse with the\r\nEnglish aristocracy. Her self-possession, ease, and independence of\r\nmanner were quite undisturbed in the presence of the proud duchesses\r\nand fraughty dames of the titled English nobility. They expected\r\ntimidity and fear, and reverence for their titles, in an untitled\r\nperson, and they found themselves disappointed. Mrs. Stowe felt herself\r\ntheir equal in social life, and acted among them as she felt. This,\r\nabove all other things, has caused a great astonishment in the higher\r\ncircles in favour of American women, for in fact it is a quality\r\npeculiarly distinguishing an American woman, that she can be and is a\r\nduchess among duchesses.\"\r\n\r\nEven in the simple article of diplomatic dress we see the same feature\r\npeeping out. Vanity may be discovered as readily in singularity, however\r\nsimple, as in the naked savage who struts about as proud as a peacock,\r\nwith no covering but a gold-laced cocked hat on his head and a\r\nbrass-mounted sword at his side. When civilized society agrees upon some\r\ndistinctive uniform for diplomatic service, who can fail to observe the\r\nlurking vanity that dictated the abolition of it by the Republic?--not\r\nto mention the absurdity of wearing a sword in plain clothes. The only\r\nparallel it has among bipeds, that I know of, is a master-at-arms on\r\nboard a ship, with a cane by his side; but then he carries a weapon\r\nwhich he is supposed to use. The Minister of the Republic carries a\r\nweapon for ornament only. In quadruped life, it reminds me of a poodle\r\nclosely shaved all over, except a little tuft at the end of his tail,\r\nthe sword and the tuft recalling to mind the fact that the respective\r\npossessors have been shorn of something.\r\n\r\nFirmly convinced, from my earliest schoolboy days, of the intimate\r\nconnexion which exists between boasting and bullying, I had long blushed\r\nto feel how pre-eminent my own country was in the ignoble practice; but\r\na more intimate acquaintance with the United States has thoroughly\r\nsatisfied me that that pre-eminence justly belongs to the great\r\nRepublic. But it is not merely in national matters that this feeling\r\nexhibits itself; you observe it in ordinary life as well, by the intense\r\nlove shown for titles; nobody is contented until he obtain some rank. I\r\nam aware this is a feature inseparable from democracy. Everybody you\r\nmeet is Captain, Colonel, General, Honourable, Judge, or something; and\r\nif they cannot obtain it legitimately, they obtain it by courtesy, or\r\nsometimes facetiously, like a gentleman I have before alluded to, who\r\nobtained the rank of judge because he was a connoisseur in wine. In\r\nthese, and a thousand other ways, the love of vanity stands nationally\r\nrevealed.\r\n\r\nI do not think Americans are aware what injustice they do themselves by\r\nthis love of high-sounding titles.[CL] For instance, in a paper before\r\nme, I see a Deputy Sheriff calling on the mob to resist the law; I see\r\nGovernor Bigler authorizing General King to call out the military, one\r\nnaturally supposes to keep order; but observe he calls Mr. Walker, of\r\nErie, a traitor and a scoundrel; of the directors and managers of the\r\nrailroad, he says, \"We will whip them, will whip them, will bury them so\r\ndeep electricity can't reach them--we will whip them--we will whip the\r\ng--ts out of them!\" &c.--Now, judging of these people by their titles,\r\nas recognised by the rest of the civilized world, what a disgrace to the\r\nhigher classes of Americans is the foregoing! But anybody who really\r\nknows the title system of the Republic will at once see that the orator\r\nwas a mere rowdy. Thus they suffer for their vanity. It pervades every\r\nclass of the whole community, from the rowdy, who talks of \"whipping\r\ncreation,\" to the pulpit orator, who often heralds forth past success to\r\nfeed the insatiable appetite: in short, it has become a national\r\ndisease; and were it not for the safety-valve formed by the unmeasured\r\nterms of mutual vituperation they heap upon each other on occasions of\r\ndomestic squabbles, their fate would assuredly be that of the frog in\r\nthe fable.\r\n\r\nIn the medical world, it is said no one has a cold without fever; and I\r\nthink it may with equal truth be asserted of the national world, no\r\nnations are vain without being afflicted with sensitiveness: at all\r\nevents, it is true as regards the United States. No maiden in her teens\r\nis so ticklishly sensitive as the Americans. I do not refer merely to\r\nthat portion of the community of which I have selected Mr. Douglas, of\r\nIllinois, as the type; I allude also to the far higher order of\r\nintelligence with which the Republic abounds. There is a touchiness\r\nabout them all with respect to national and local questions which I\r\nnever saw equalled: in fact, the few sheets of their Press which reach\r\nthis country are alone sufficient to convince any one on that point; for\r\nin a free country the Press may always be fairly considered, to a\r\ncertain extent, as the reflex of the public mind. I suppose it is with\r\nnations as with individuals, and that each are alike blind to their own\r\nfailings. In no other way can I account for the Republic overlooking so\r\nentirely the sensitiveness of others. Take for instance the appointment\r\nof M. Soulé--a Frenchman naturalized in America--as minister to the\r\ncourt of Spain. I do not say that he was a Filibustero, but he was\r\nuniversally supposed to be identified with that party; and if he were\r\nnot so identified, he showed a puerile ignorance of the requirements of\r\na Minister, quite beyond conception, when he received a serenade of five\r\nthousand people at New York, who came in procession, bearing aloft the\r\naccompanying transparencies, he being at the time accredited to his new\r\nministry.\r\n\r\nOn the first transparency was the following motto:--\r\n\r\n  A STAR.     PIERCE.\r\n\r\n  SOULÉ.      CUBA.\r\n\r\nOn the second banner:--\r\n\r\n  YOUNG AMERICA AND YOUNG CUBA.\r\n  Free thought and free speech for the Cubans.\r\n\r\n  'Tis no flight of fancy, for\r\n  Cuba must be, and 'tis\r\n  Written by fate, an isle\r\n  Great and free.\r\n\r\n  O pray, ye doomed tyrants,\r\n    Your fate's not far:\r\n  A dread Order now watches you,--\r\n    It is the Lone Star.\r\n\r\nOn the third banner:--\r\n\r\n  Cuba must and shall be free.\r\n\r\n  The Antilles Flower,\r\n    The true Key of the Gulf,\r\n  Must be plucked from the Crown\r\n    Of the Old Spanish Wolf.\r\n\r\nMonumental representation--a tomb and a weeping willow. On the tomb were\r\nthe words--\r\n\r\n  LOPEZ   AND   CRITTENDEN,\r\n\r\n  AGUERO AND ARMATERO.\r\n\r\n  They and their companions are not forgotten.\r\n\r\nM. Soulé accepts the compliment, and makes a speech, in which he informs\r\nhis audience that he cannot believe \"that this mighty nation can be\r\nchained now within the narrow limits which fettered the young Republic\r\nof America,\" &c.\r\n\r\nChange the scene, and let any American judge in the following supposed\r\nand parallel case. Imagine expeditions fitted out in England, in spite\r\nof Government, to free the slaves in the Southern States; imagine a\r\nLopez termination to the affair, and the rowdy blood of England forming\r\nother Filibustero expeditions; then imagine the Hon. Mr. Tenderheart\r\nidentifying himself with them, and receiving an appointment as minister\r\nto Washington; after which, imagine him serenaded at St. James's by\r\nthousands of people bearing transparencies, the first representing a\r\nnaked woman under the slave-driver's lash; the second, containing some\r\nsuch verses as \"The Antilles Flower,\" &c.; for instance:--\r\n\r\n  \"The slaves must be plucked\r\n    From the chains that now gall 'em,\r\n  Though American wolves\r\n    An inferior race call 'em.\"\r\n\r\nLet the minister accept the serenade, and address the multitude,\r\ndeclaring \"that this mighty nation can no longer be chained down to\r\npassive interference,\" &c. Let me ask any American how the Hon. Mr.\r\nTenderheart would be received at Washington, particularly if a few days\r\nafter he took a shot at his French colleague because another person\r\ninsulted him in that gentleman's house?--I ask, what would Americans say\r\nif such a line of conduct were to be pursued towards them? I might go\r\nfurther, and suppose that a conclave of English Ministers met at Quebec,\r\nand discussed the question as to how far the flourishing town of\r\nBuffalo, so close on the frontier, was calculated to endanger the peace\r\nand prosperity of Canada, and then imagine them winding up their report\r\nwith this clause--If it be so--\"then by every law, human and divine, we\r\nshall be justified in wresting it from its present owners.\" The American\r\nwho penned that sentence must possess a copy of the Scriptures unknown\r\nto the rest of the world. Surely America must imagine she has the\r\nmonopoly of all the sensitiveness in the world, or she would never have\r\nacted by Spain as she has done. How humiliated must she feel while\r\ncontemplating the contrast between her act in appointing the minister,\r\nand Spain's demeanour in her silent and dignified reception of him!\r\n\r\nThis same sensitiveness peeps out in small things as well as great,\r\nespecially where England is concerned: thus, one writer discovers that\r\nthe Americans speak French better than the English; probably he infers\r\nit from having met a London Cit who had run over to Paris for a quiet\r\nSunday, and who asked him \"_Moosyere, savvay voo oo ey lay Toolureeze?\"_\r\nAnother discovers that American society is much more sought after than\r\nEnglish; that Americans are more agreeable, more intelligent, more\r\nliberal, &c.; but the comparison is always with England or the English.\r\nAnd why all this? Simply because it feeds the morbid appetite of many\r\nRepublican citizens, which the pure truth would not.\r\n\r\nThis sensitiveness also shows itself in the way they watch the opinions\r\nof their country expressed by _The Times_, or by any largely circulating\r\npaper. I remember an American colonel who had been through the whole\r\nMexican war, saying to me one day, \"I assure you the Mexican troops are\r\nthe most contemptible soldiers in the world; I would rather a thousand\r\nto one face them than half the number of Camanche Indians.\"--The object\r\nof this remark was to show on what slight and insufficient grounds _The\r\nTimes_ had spoken of the United States as a great military nation since\r\nthe Mexican war. An article giving them due credit for a successful\r\ncampaign was easily magnified beyond its intended proportions, and my\r\ngallant friend was modestly disclaiming so high-sounding an appellation;\r\nbut such evidently was the construction which he felt his countrymen had\r\nput upon it.\r\n\r\nI turn now for a few moments to the question of Morals; and here, again,\r\nit is of course only in a wholesale manner I can treat of the subject.\r\nAs far as my inquiries enable me to judge, I find the same elements\r\nproducing the same results here as in England. Wherever masses are\r\nclustered together most largely, there vice runs as rampant as in\r\nEngland; nay, I have the authority of a lecture delivered at the\r\nMaryland Institute, for saying that it is even worse in many places.\r\nAfter describing various instances of lawless conduct, the lecturer\r\ncontinues thus: \"Such lawlessness as I have described is not tolerated\r\nin any other part of the world, and would not be tolerated here for a\r\nmoment, but for the criminal apathy of our citizens generally, and the\r\ntruckling, on the part of our politicians and public officers, for the\r\nvotes of the very men whom they know to be violating and trampling on\r\nthe laws.\"--In illustration, he states, \"In every part of Europe in\r\nwhich I have travelled,--in England, Holland, France, Germany,\r\nSwitzerland, and Italy; under all the different systems of religion and\r\nforms of government; in the large cities, and the small towns and\r\nvillages; in the highways and byways,--I found better public order, more\r\ndecorum, where bodies of men were assembled together, and less tendency\r\nto rowdyism, pugilism, and violence, than there is in most parts of this\r\ncountry. In this general statement of the fact, all unprejudiced\r\ntravellers will, I suppose concur.\"--Further on, he draws a comparison\r\nfavourable to London; and, with regard to the Police in our metropolis,\r\nhe says, \"A more respectable and finer-looking body of men it would be\r\ndifficult to find in any country. A stranger may apply to one for\r\ninformation, with a certainty of receiving a polite and intelligent\r\nanswer,\" &c.--I only quote the last paragraph, in case Mr. Matt. Ward\r\nshould see these pages, and that he may know how the Police behave\r\ntowards those who know how to conduct themselves.[CM]\r\n\r\nThe lecturer goes on to complain of the depravity of youth. He then\r\nattacks the dispensation of the law, pointing out many instances of\r\ntheir mal-administration. He then proceeds to attack the fire companies;\r\nhe admits their courage and daring, but points out at the same time\r\ntheir lawlessness. He says--speaking of Philadelphia--\"Almost every\r\ncompany has its war-song, breathing the most barbarous and bloodthirsty\r\nsentiments towards some rival association, and describing the glory of\r\nthe fireman to the destruction of his enemy's apparatus, or worse yet,\r\nhis life.\"--He gives the following list of the terrific names of the\r\ncompanies: \"Hornets, Snappers, Blood-reds, Bed-bugs, Rock-boys,\r\nBuffaloes, Skimmers, Scrougers, Revengers, Knockers, Black-hawks,\r\nPirate-boys, Kill-devils.\" After which he gives the following specimen,\r\nof their songs, written by a \"Bluffer and Red-devil:\"--\r\n\r\n  \"INDEPENDENT HOSE SONG.\r\n\r\n  \"We're the saucy Hyena-boys of George's-street, as all knows; We can\r\n  whip the Penn and Globe, likewise the Carroll Hose; We'll whip the\r\n  three together, the Bed-bugs and South Penn throw in for ease; We do\r\n  run our carriage among our foes, and run her where we please.\r\n\r\n  \"You'd better hush your blowing, Globe, if you know when you are well;\r\n  For if we take your engine again, we'll smash her all to hell. Here is\r\n  luck to the Bluffers, and all honest boys of that name; Here is to the\r\n  Hyenas and Red-devils, that no one can tame.\"\r\n\r\nHe subsequently points out the evils of allowing political passions to\r\nguide citizens in the selection of officers, and declares, \"that persons\r\nare elected to, and now fill, important offices in Baltimore, to whom no\r\nresponsible trust in private life would be confided by the very men who\r\nvoted for them.\"[CN] With regard to the actual commission of crime, and\r\nthe due punishment of the offenders, he draws the following comparison\r\nbetween London and Baltimore: \"The population of the former is 13 times\r\ngreater than that of the latter; but the number of arrests is as 1 to\r\n7,--in other words, the commission of crime, in proportion to numbers,\r\nwas 46 per cent. greater than in London. Then, to show the inefficiency\r\nof the law, he proceeds to state, that the commitments for trial were\r\nonly 29 per cent. greater, and that, even of those committed, many\r\nescaped just punishment. Of course, the large cities in America are the\r\nonly places in which any comparison can be made with this country; but,\r\nwhile doing so, the tide of emigration, which helps to fill up their\r\nnumbers, must not be lost sight of, or we should judge them unfairly.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the masses that are spread over the length and breadth of\r\nthe land, I certainly have never seen nor heard anything that need make\r\nEngland ashamed of the comparison. It would not be equitable to judge by\r\nmere numbers,--you must also bring into the balance the comparative\r\nstate of affluence and independence of the respective parties; for who\r\ncan doubt that distress is one of the great causes of crime? Even in the\r\nwealthy State of New York, I find an account of the following outrage,\r\ncommitted upon a Mr. Lawrence, when serving a summons upon his\r\naggressor, Mr. Deitz: \"He found Mr. Deitz near the house, and handed him\r\nthe papers. Deitz took them and read them, when he threw them on the\r\nground,--seized Lawrence by the throat, calling him a d----d scoundrel,\r\nfor coming to serve papers on him. He then called to his family to blow\r\na horn, when a man, named Hollenbeck, who was at work for Deitz as a\r\nmason, interceded for Lawrence, who managed to get away, and started off\r\non a run. Deitz followed in pursuit, knocked Lawrence down, and held him\r\nuntil four men in disguise made their appearance. They then tied his\r\nhands behind him, and took him to a small piece of bush near by,--then\r\ntore off his coat, vest, and cravat, and with a jack-knife cut off his\r\nhair, occasionally cutting his scalp,--and, remarking that they had a\r\nplaster that would heal it up, they tarred his head and body, and poured\r\ntar into his boots. After exhausting all their ingenuity this way, each\r\ncut a stick, and whipped him until they got tired. They then tied his\r\nhands before him, and started him for the house, each of them kicking\r\nhim at every step. They made him take the papers back, but took them\r\naway again;--when, after knocking him down again, they left him, and he\r\nsucceeded in reaching the residence of George Beckers last evening. His\r\nlegs, hands, arms, and face are badly bruised.\"--If we travel West and\r\nSouth, we shall doubtless find that morality is far more lax than in\r\nEngland; but what can you expect where gentlemen, even senators for\r\nStates, go out to fight bloody duels with rifles at twenty paces, while\r\ncrowds of spectators are looking on?\r\n\r\nWhere the Americans have the advantage over our population is, first and\r\nforemost, in possessing a boundless extent of territory which gives a\r\nrich return for comparatively little labour, and where, if labour is\r\nwanted, the scarcity of the article insures its commanding a high price.\r\nCompare England for one moment with two of the oldest American States,\r\nand therefore the most thickly populated:--\r\n\r\n                                     Square Miles.  Inhabitants.\r\n\r\n  England      contains              50,000         17,923,000\r\n  New York        \"                  46,000          3,097,000\r\n  Pennsylvania    \"                  46,000          2,311,786\r\n\r\nWe here see, that if we take the most populous States in the Union, the\r\nproportion is nearly 6 to 1 in favour of America; but, if we mass the\r\nwhole, we shall find--\r\n\r\n                                     Square Miles.  Inhabitants.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland contain    120,000      27,400,000\r\nUnited States                      3,500,000      23,192,000\r\n\r\nThis would bring the proportion of population to extent of territory, in\r\nrough numbers:--\r\n\r\n  Great Britain and Ireland  228 inhabitants to the square mile.\r\n  United States                7      \"         \"       \"\r\n\r\nIn other words, Great Britain is 32 times as thickly populated as the\r\nRepublic. If these facts are borne in mind, I confess that the\r\ncommission of crime in Great Britain appears to me proportionally far\r\nsmaller than in the States, notwithstanding all the advantages of the\r\nfree and liberal education which is within their reach.\r\n\r\nI cannot but think that the general system of training youth in the\r\nRepublic has a most prejudicial effect, in many instances, on their\r\nafter-life. In their noble zeal for the education of the brain, they\r\nappear to me to lose sight almost entirely of the necessity of\r\ndisciplining the mind to that obedience to authority, which lays the\r\nfoundation of self-control and respect for the laws of the land.\r\nNationally speaking, there is scarcely such a thing as a lad in the\r\nwhole Union. A boy in the States hardly gets over the novelty of that\r\nportion of his dress which marks the difference of sex, ere his motto\r\nis: \"I don't care; I shall do what I best please:\" in short, he is made\r\na man before he ceases to be a boy; he consequently becomes unable to\r\nexercise that restraint which better discipline might have taught him,\r\nand the acts of his after-life are thus more likely to be influenced by\r\npassion and self-will than by reason or reflection. I find in the\r\nlecture from which I have already quoted, the following paragraph,\r\nwhich, as I consider it illustrative of my last observation, I insert at\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n  \"But the most alarming feature in the condition of things, not only in\r\n  the city, but elsewhere throughout the country, is the lawlessness of\r\n  the youth. The most striking illustration of this which I have seen is\r\n  taken from a Cincinnati paper of last January. It seems that in the\r\n  course of a few days one hundred applications had been made by parents\r\n  in that city to have their own children sent to the House of Refuge.\r\n  The particulars of one case, which happened a short time before, are\r\n  given:--a boy, twelve years of age, was brought before the Mayor's\r\n  Court by his father, who stated that the family were absolutely afraid\r\n  the youth would take their lives, and that he had purchased a pistol\r\n  for the purpose of shooting the housekeeper. A double-barrelled pistol\r\n  was produced in court, which the police-officer had taken from the\r\n  boy, who avowed that he had bought it for the purpose stated. The\r\n  mayor sent the boy to the House of Refuge.\"\r\n\r\nI now pass on to the question of Liberty in the United States. If by\r\nliberty be understood the will of the greater number ruling the State or\r\nregulating its laws, certainly they have more liberty than England; but\r\nif by liberty be understood that balance of power and adaptation of the\r\nlaws to the various interests of the whole community, combined with the\r\ndue execution, of them against offenders of whatever class, then I\r\nconsider that there is unquestionably more liberty in England, in spite\r\nof the restrictions by which the franchise is limited--nay, rather I\r\nshould say, in consequence of those very restrictions; for I believe\r\nthey tend to secure the services of more liberal, high-minded, and\r\nindependent representatives than any country--however highly educated\r\nits population may be--would return under a system of universal\r\nsuffrage. I do not intend to convey in the foregoing observation, any\r\nopinion as to how far it is desirable, or otherwise, to modify the\r\nrestrictions at present existing in England; it is obvious they should\r\nkeep pace with the growing intelligence of the community, inasmuch as,\r\nif they do not, popular agitation is readily excited, and violent\r\nchanges are forced by ignorant passion, going far beyond those which\r\neducated prudence and a sense of justice ought to have brought\r\nforward.--Prevention is better than cure.\r\n\r\nMr. Everett, in a letter dated July 25, 1853, after observing that it\r\nhas long been the boast of England that she is the great city of refuge\r\nfor the rest of Europe, adds, \"it is the prouder boast of the United\r\nStates, that they are, and ever have been, an asylum for the rest of the\r\nworld, including Great Britain herself:\" he then goes on to say, \"no\r\ncitizen has ever been driven into banishment.\"--This is bravely said by\r\nan able son of the \"Land of Liberty;\" but when he penned it, he appears\r\nto have forgotten that there are upwards of three millions of his own\r\nfellow-creatures held in the galling shackles of hopeless slavery by the\r\ncitizens of that land of which he makes so proud a boast; and that from\r\none to two thousand of the wretched victims escape annually to the\r\nBritish colony adjoining, which is their sole city of refuge on the\r\nwhole North American continent. Doubtless Mr. Everett's countrymen do\r\nnot sufficiently know this startling point of difference, or they would\r\nhesitate in accepting such a boast. So ignorant are some of his\r\ncountrymen of the real truth as regards the citizens of Great Britain,\r\nthat a friend of mine was asked by a well-educated and otherwise\r\nintelligent son of the Republic, \"Is it really true that all the land in\r\nEngland belongs to the Queen?\"\r\n\r\nWhile on the subject of liberty, it is well to observe one or two\r\ncurious ways in which it may be said to be controlled in America. If\r\nany gentleman wished to set up a marked livery for his servants, he\r\ncould not do so without being the subject of animadversions in the rowdy\r\nPress, styling him a would-be aristocrat. But perhaps the most\r\nextraordinary vagary is the Yankee notion that service is degrading; the\r\nconsequence of which is that you very rarely see a Yankee servant; and\r\nif by chance you find one on a farm, he insists on living and eating\r\nwith the overseer. So jealous are they of the appearance of service,\r\nthat on many of the railways there was considerable difficulty in\r\ngetting the guard, or conductor, to wear a riband on his hat designating\r\nhis office, and none of the people attached to the railway station will\r\nput on any livery or uniform by which they can be known. I wonder if it\r\never occurs to these sons of the Republic, that in thus acting they are\r\nstriking at the very root of their vaunted equal rights of man, and\r\nspreading a broader base of aristocracy than even the Old World can\r\nproduce. Servants, of course, there must be in every community, and it\r\nis ridiculous to suppose that American gentlemen ever did, or ever will,\r\nlive with their housemaids, cooks, and button-boys; and if this be so,\r\nand that Americans consider such service as degrading, is it not\r\nperfectly clear that the sons of the soil set themselves up as nobles,\r\nand look upon the emigrants--on whom the duties of service chiefly\r\ndevolve--in the light of serfs?\r\n\r\nI may, while discussing service, as well touch upon the subject of\r\nstrikes. The Press in America is very ready to pass strictures on the\r\nlow rate of wages in this country, such as the three-ha'penny\r\nshirt-makers, and a host of other ill-paid and hard-worked poor. Every\r\nhumane man must regret to see the pressure of competition producing such\r\ndisgraceful results; but my American friends, if they look carefully\r\ninto their own country, will see that they act in precisely the same\r\nway, as far as they are able; in short, that they get labour as cheap as\r\nthey can. Fortunately for the poor emigrant, the want of hands is so\r\ngreat, that they can insure a decent remuneration for their work; but\r\nthe proof that the Anglo-Saxon in America is no better than the rest of\r\nthe world in this respect, is to be found in the fact that strikes for\r\nhigher wages also take place among them. I remember once reading in the\r\nsame paper of the strike of three different interests; one of which was\r\nthat indispensable body, the hotel-waiters. The negroes even joined with\r\nthe whites, and they gained their point; they knew the true theory of\r\nstrikes, and made their move \"when the market was rising.\" The hotels\r\nwere increasing their charges, and they merely wanted their share of the\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nI now propose to consider one of the brightest features in the national\r\ncharacter--Intelligence. Irresistible testimony is borne to their\r\nappreciation of the value of education, not merely by the multitudes of\r\nschools of all kinds, and by the numbers that attend them, but also by\r\nthat arrangement of which they may be so justly proud, and which opens\r\nthe door to every branch of study to their poorest citizens free of\r\nexpense. No praise is too high for such a noble national institution as\r\nthe school system of the Republic. How far it may be advisable to bring\r\nall the various classes of the community together at that early age when\r\nhabits which affect after-life are so readily acquired, is another\r\nquestion. Though the roughness of the many may derive advantage from\r\ncontact with the polish of the few, it appears to me more than probable\r\nthat the polish of the few will be influenced far more considerably by\r\nthe roughness of the many. I cannot, therefore, but imagine that the\r\nuniversal admixture of all classes of society in early infancy must\r\noperate prejudicially to that advancement in the refinements of\r\ncivilization which tends to give a superior tone to the society of every\r\ncountry. It must not, however, be imagined that the intelligence\r\nobtained at these schools is confined to those subjects which are\r\nrequisite for making dollars and cents. People of this country, judging\r\nof the Republicans by the general accounts given of them through the\r\nPress, can have little idea of the extent to which the old standard\r\nworks of the mother-country are read; but there is an intelligent\r\nportion of our own nation to be found among the booksellers, who can\r\nenlighten them on this point. I have been told by several of them, not\r\nonly that old editions of our best authors are rapidly being bought up\r\nby citizens of the United States, but that in making their purchases\r\nthey exhibit an intimate acquaintance with them far greater than they\r\nfind generally among Englishmen, and which proves how thoroughly they\r\nare appreciated by them.\r\n\r\nThen again, with reference to their own country; it is impossible for\r\nany one to travel among them without being struck with the universal\r\nintelligence they possess as to its constitution, its politics, its\r\nlaws, and all general subjects connected with its prosperity or its\r\nrequirements; and if they do not always convey their information in the\r\nmost classical language, at all events they convey it in clear and\r\nunmistakeable terms. The Constitution of their country is regularly\r\ntaught at their schools; and doubtless it is owing to this early insight\r\ninto the latent springs by which the machinery of Government is worked,\r\nthat their future appetite for more minute details becomes whetted. I\r\nquestion very much if every boy, on leaving a high school in the United\r\nStates, does not know far more of the institutions of his country than\r\nnine-tenths of the members of the British House of Commons do of theirs.\r\nAt the same time it should not be forgotten, that the complications\r\nwhich have grown up with a nationality of centuries render the study far\r\nmore difficult in this country, than it possibly can, be in the giant\r\nRepublic of yesterday. And in the same way taxation in England, of which\r\n30,000,000l. is due as interest on debt before the State receives one\r\nfarthing for its disbursements, is one of the most intricate questions\r\nto be understood even by enlarged minds; whereas in the United States,\r\nscarcely any taxation exists, and the little that does, creates a\r\nsurplus revenue which they often appear at a loss to know how to get rid\r\nof.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, the intelligence of the community sometimes exhibits itself\r\nin a 'cuteness which I am not prepared to defend. A clear apprehension\r\nof their immediate material interests has produced repudiation of\r\nlegitimate obligations; but those days are, nationally speaking, I hope,\r\ngone by, and many of their merchants stand as high in the estimation of\r\nthe commercial world as it is possible to desire. At the same time, it\r\nis equally true that the spirit of commercial gambling has risen to a\r\npoint in the States far above what it ever has in this country,--except,\r\nperhaps, during the Railway epidemic; and the number of failures is\r\nlamentably great.\r\n\r\nWith their intelligence they combine an enterprise that knows no\r\nnational parallel. This quality, aided by their law of limited\r\nliability, has doubtless tended to urge forward many works and schemes\r\nfrom which the Union is deriving, and has derived, great wealth and\r\nadvantage; at the same time it has opened the door for the unscrupulous\r\nand the shrewd to come in and play high stakes with small capital--in\r\nplaying which reckless game, while some become millionaires others\r\nbecome bankrupts. This latter state is a matter of comparative\r\nunimportance in a country like the Republic, where the field is so\r\ngreat, and a livelihood easily attainable until some opening occurs,\r\nwhen they are as ready to rush into it again as if they had been foaled\r\nat Niagara, and had sucked in the impetuosity of its cataract.\r\n\r\nThere is one shape that their enterprise takes which it would indeed be\r\nwell for us to imitate, and that is early rising. I quite blush for my\r\ncountry when I think what a \"Castle of Indolence\" we are in that\r\nrespect, especially those who have not the slightest excuse for it. On\r\nwhat principle the classes of society in England who are masters of\r\ntheir own time, turn night into day, waste millions yearly in oil and\r\nwax, and sleep away the most fresh and healthy hours of the morning, for\r\nno other visible purpose but to enable themselves to pass the night in\r\nthe most stuffy and unhealthy atmosphere, is beyond my comprehension.\r\nOne thing is certain: it has a tendency to enervate both body and mind,\r\nand were it not for the revivifying effects produced by a winter\r\nresidence in the country, where gentlemen take to field sports, and\r\nladies to razeed dresses, sensible shoes, and constitutional walks, the\r\nmortality among our \"upper ten thousand\" would, I believe, be frightful.\r\nIn America, the \"boys\" get up so early, that it is said they frequently\r\n\"catch the birds by their tails as they are going to roost;\" and it is\r\nno doubt owing to this that they are so 'cute. Talk about \"catching a\r\nweasel asleep,\" let me see any of my metropolitan drone friends who can\r\ncatch a Yankee boy asleep!\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, merely to early rising that they owe their\r\n'cuteness. A total absence of idleness, and the fact of being constantly\r\nthrown on their own resources in cases of minor difficulty, aid\r\nmaterially in sharpening their wits. You may see these latter influences\r\noperating in the difference between soldiers and sailors, when placed in\r\nsituations where they have to shift for themselves. Some of their\r\nanecdotes bearing upon 'cuteness are amusing enough. I will give one as\r\nan illustration.--Owing to some unknown cause, there was a great dearth\r\nof eggs in one of the New England States, and they consequently rose\r\nconsiderably in price. It immediately occurred to a farmer's wife, that,\r\nif she could in any way increase the produce of her hens, it would be a\r\nsource of great gain to her; she accordingly fitted the bottom of each\r\nlaying hen's bed with a spring, and fixed a basin underneath, capable of\r\nholding two eggs. In due time, the hens laid; but as each hen, after\r\nlaying, missed the warmth of the precious deposit, she got up to look if\r\nit was all right. To her astonishment, no egg was to be seen. \"Bless my\r\nsoul!\" says the hen, \"well, I declare I thought I had laid an egg. I\r\nsuppose I must be mistaken;\" and down she went to fulfil her duties\r\nagain. Once more she rose to verify her success. No egg was there.\r\n\"Well, I vow,\" quoth Mrs. Hen, \"they must be playing me some trick: I'll\r\nhave one more shot, and, if I don't succeed, I shall give it up.\" Again\r\nshe returned to her labours, and the two eggs that had passed into the\r\nbasin below supporting the base of her bed, success crowned her efforts,\r\nand she exclaimed, \"Well, I have done it this time at all events!\" The\r\n'cute wife kept her counsel, and said nothing, either to the hens or to\r\nher neighbours, and thus realized a comfortable little bag of\r\ndollars.--I give the anecdote as narrated to me, and I must confess I\r\nnever saw the operation, or heard the remarks of the outwitted hens. I\r\ninsert it lest in these days of agricultural distress (?) any farmer's\r\nwife be disposed to make a trial of a similar experiment.[CO]\r\n\r\nI proceed to consider the energy of the Republicans, a quality in which\r\nthey may challenge comparison with the world. No enterprise is too great\r\nfor them to undertake, and no hardship too severe for them to endure.\r\nA Yankee will start off with his household gods, and seek a new home in\r\nthe wilderness, with less fuss than a Cockney would make about packing\r\nup a basket of grub to go and pic-nic in Richmond Park. It is the spirit\r\nof adventure that has enabled them to cover a whole continent in the\r\nincredible manner which the map of the United States shows. The great\r\ndrawback to this phase of their energy is the total absence it exhibits\r\nof those ties of home to which we so fondly cling in the old country. If\r\nwe were a nation of Yankees, I feel persuaded that in five years we\r\nshould not have ten millions of inhabitants. No Yankee can exist without\r\nelbow-room, except it be the more degraded and rowdy portion of the\r\ncommunity, who find a more congenial atmosphere in those sinks of vice\r\ninseparable from large towns. This migratory spirit has caused them to\r\nexhibit their energy and enterprise in those countless miles of rail and\r\ntelegraph, which bring the citizens of the most distant States into easy\r\ncommunication with Washington and the Eastern cities. The difficulty of\r\nprocuring labour is no doubt one cause of the very inefficient way in\r\nwhich many of these works are performed; and it also disables them for\r\nexecuting gigantic works with the speed and certainty that such\r\noperations are completed in England. The miniature Crystal Palace at New\r\nYork afforded a convincing proof of what I have stated; for although it\r\nwas little more than a quarter of the size of the one in Hyde Park, they\r\nwere utterly foiled in their endeavours to prepare it in time. In\r\nrevenge for that failure, the Press tried to console the natives by\r\nenlarging on the superior attraction of hippodromes, ice-saloons, and\r\npenny shows, with which it was surrounded, and contrasting them with the\r\n\"gloomy grandeur\" of the palace in London. Gloomy grandeur is, I\r\nsuppose, the Yankee way of expressing the finest park in any city in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAmong other remarks on Americans, I have heard many of my countrymen\r\nsay, \"Look how they run after lords!\"--It is quite true; a live lord is\r\na comparative novelty, and they run after him in the same way as people\r\nin England run after an Indian prince, or any pretentious Oriental: it\r\nis an Anglo-Saxon mania. Not very long ago, a friend of mine found a\r\nSyrian swaggering about town, _fêted_ everywhere, as though he were the\r\ngreatest man of the day; and who should the Syrian nabob turn out to be,\r\nbut a man he had employed as a servant in the East, and whom he had been\r\nobliged to get bastinadoed for petty theft. In England we run after we\r\nknow not whom; in America, if a lord be run after, there is at all\r\nevents a strong presumption in favour of his being at least a gentleman.\r\nWe toady our Indian swells, and they toady their English swells; and I\r\ntrust, for our sake, that in so doing they have a decided advantage over\r\nus.\r\n\r\nI have also heard some of my countrymen observe, as to their\r\nhospitality, \"Oh! it's very well; but if you went there as often as I\r\ndo, you would see how soon their hospitality wears off.\" Who on earth\r\never heard such an unreasonable remark! Because a man, in the fulness of\r\nhospitality, dedicates his time, his money, and his convenience to\r\nwelcome a stranger, of whose character and of whose sociability he knows\r\nnothing whatever, is he therefore bound to be saddled with that\r\nacquaintance as often as the traveller chooses to visit the American\r\nContinent? Is not the very idea preposterous? No man in the world is\r\nmore ready to welcome the stranger than the American; but if the\r\nstranger revisit the same places, the courtesy and hospitality he\r\nreceives must, in justice, depend upon the impression which his company\r\nhas left on those upon whom he inflicted it. No doubt the scanty number\r\nof travellers enables Americans to exercise more universal hospitality\r\nthan they could do if the country were filled with strangers in the same\r\nway as Great Britain is. The increased travelling of late years has\r\nnecessarily made a marked difference on that point among ourselves, and\r\ndoubtless it may hereafter act upon the United States; but the man who\r\ndoes not admit hospitality to be a most distinctive feature of the\r\nRepublic, at the present time, must indeed be rotten in the brain or the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the political character of the Union, it is very much in\r\nthe same state as that of England. The two original parties were Whig\r\nand Democrat, the former being synonymous with the Tory party in this\r\ncountry--i.e., an honest body of men, who, in their earnest endeavours\r\nto keep the coach straight, put the drag on so often that the horses get\r\nrestive sometimes, and start off at score when they feel the wheel\r\nclogged. The Democrats are more nearly represented by a compound of\r\nWhig and Radical--i.e., a body of men who, in their energetic\r\nexertions to make the coach go, don't trouble themselves much about the\r\nroad, and look upon the drag as a piece of antiquated humbug. Sometimes\r\nthis carelessness also leads to the team-bolting; but in the States\r\nthere is so much open country that they may run away for miles without\r\nan upset; whereas in England, when this difficulty occurs, the ribands\r\nare generally handed over to the Jarvey of the opposite party. This old\r\nstate of affairs is entirely changed in both hemispheres; each party is\r\nmore or less broken up, and in neither country is there at present any\r\ndistinct body sufficiently numerous to form a strong government.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these disruptions, it may be imagined how difficult it\r\nwould be to give any accurate description of the different pieces of\r\ncrockery that constitute the political \"service.\" Formerly, the two\r\ncries of \"Protection to Home Manufacture\" and \"Free Trade\" were the\r\ndistinct rallying points. At present there are Slaveholders, Slavery\r\nExtension, Free-soil, Abolitionist, Annexationist, and Heaven alone\r\nknows how many more parties, on the question of Slavery alone, into\r\nwhich the Democratic or dominant party is divided, independent of those\r\nother general political divisions which must necessarily exist in so\r\nlarge and varied a community. From the foregoing you will observe that,\r\nto say a man is a Democrat conveys no distinct idea of his politics\r\nexcept that he is not a Whig; and the Whigs also have their divisions on\r\nthe Slave question.\r\n\r\nBut there is a party lately come into the field, and called the\r\nKnow-nothings, which requires a special notice. Their ostensible\r\nprinciples have been published in the leading journals of this country,\r\nand carry a certain degree of reason upon the face of them, the leading\r\nfeatures being that they are a secret society banded together for the\r\npurpose of opposing the priestly influence of the Humanists in political\r\nmatters: for prolonging the period requisite to obtain the rights of\r\ncitizenship; and for the support of the native-born American in\r\nopposition to all other candidates for any public situation that may be\r\ncontested. Such is the substance of their manifesto. Their opponents say\r\nthat they are sheer humbugs, and brought into life by a few old\r\npolitical hacks for their own selfish ends. Owing to the factions in\r\nthe old Whig and Democratic parties, their opponents believe they may\r\nsucceed for a year or two, but they prophesy their speedy and total\r\ndisruption. Time will show--I am no prophet. There is one point in their\r\ncharter, however, that I cannot believe will ever succeed--viz.,\r\nnaturalization or citizenship. Congress would be loth to pass any law\r\nthat might tend to turn the stream of emigration into another channel,\r\nsuch as Australia or Canada; and individual States would be equally loth\r\nto pass such a local law for the same reason, inasmuch as if they did,\r\nthe emigrants would move on to those States where they obtained most\r\nspeedily the rights of citizens. The crusade against the Romanists is\r\nalso so opposed to the spirit of a constitution which professes the\r\nprinciple of the equal rights of man, that it is more than probable they\r\nmay ere long divide upon the unsolvable question of how to draw the line\r\nof demarcation between the influence of the priest and the opinion of\r\nhis flock. As far, therefore, as I am capable of judging, I do not\r\nbelieve they have a sufficiently broad and distinct basis to stand upon,\r\nand I think also that the fact of their being a secret society will\r\nrather hasten their end than otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe last point I shall allude to is the future prospects of the\r\nRepublic; a question which doubtless is veiled in much obscurity. The\r\nblack cloud of the South hangs perpetually over their heads, ever from\r\ntime to time threatening to burst upon them. In the Free States many\r\nfeel strongly the degradation of being forced to aid in the capture of\r\nthe fugitive slave; and the aversion to the repulsive task is increasing\r\nrather than decreasing. The citizens have on many occasions risen in\r\nmasses against those who were executing the law, and the military have\r\nbeen brought into collision with them in defending the authorities. The\r\ndread of breaking up the Union alone prevents that clause being struck\r\nout from the Constitution, by which they are compelled not merely to\r\nrestore but to hunt up the fugitive. The \"Freesoilers\" also feel\r\nindignant at seeing their nation turning virgin soil into a land of\r\nSlavery; the Nebraska Bill has strengthened that feeling considerably.\r\nThe Abolitionists are subject to constant fits of rabidity which\r\nincrease intensity with each successive attack. Thousands and thousands\r\nof Northerns, who writhe under the feeling that their star-spangled\r\nbanner is crossed with the stripes of the slave, turn back to the\r\nhistory of their country, and recalling to mind the glorious deeds that\r\ntheir ancestors have accomplished under that flag, their hearts\r\nrespond--\"The Union for ever!\"\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the strongest feeling in the Republic which tends to keep\r\nthings quiet, is that the intelligence of the community of the North,\r\nwho are opposed both to slavery and to the fugitive law, foresee that if\r\nthose objects are only to be obtained at the price of separation from\r\nthe South, greater evils would probably accrue than those they are\r\nanxious to remove. However peaceably a separation might be made in\r\nappearance, it could never take place without the most bitter feelings\r\nof animosity. Junius describes the intensity of the feeling, by saying,\r\n\"He hated me as much as if he had once been my friend;\" and so it would\r\nassuredly prove. Squabbles would breed quarrels, and quarrels would grow\r\ninto wars; the comparative harmony of a continent would be broken up,\r\nand standing armies and fleets become as necessary in the New World as\r\nthey unfortunately are in the Old. If the South are determined to\r\nperpetuate Slavery, the only way it will ever cease to stain the Union\r\nis by the force of public opinion, and by the immigration of the white\r\nman gradually driving the negro southwards from State to State. As his\r\nvalue decreases, breeding for the market will gradually cease; and he\r\nmay eventually die out if the millennium does not interfere with the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nAnother, possible cause for division in the Union may come from\r\nCalifornia, in which State a feeble cry has already been heard of--\"a\r\nWestern Republic.\" The facility of intercourse afforded by railroads\r\nseems likely to stop the swelling of that cry; but if California did\r\nseparate, it would not be attended with those evils which a disruption\r\nof the Southern States would inevitably produce. The only other chance\r\nof a division in the Republic which I can conceive possible is, in the\r\nevent of a long war with any great maritime power, for ends which only\r\naffected one particular portion of the States; in which case the\r\nirresistible influence of the all mighty dollar might come into powerful\r\naction. The wealth of America is her commerce; whatever checks that,\r\nchecks the pulsations of her vitality; and unless her honour was\r\nthoroughly compromised in the struggle, neither North nor South would be\r\ndisposed to prolong a ruinous struggle for the sole benefit of the\r\nother. The prospects of such a contingency may, I trust, be deemed\r\nvisionary. France is not likely to come in contact with the Union; and\r\nthe only other maritime nation is Great Britain, whose interests are so\r\nidentified with peace, that it is hardly possible she should encourage\r\nany other than the most friendly relations. Neither party could gain\r\nanything by a war, and both parties would inevitably suffer immensely;\r\nand although I fear there is but too strong evidence, that many ignoble\r\nminds in the Republic make blustering speeches, and strive to excite\r\nhostile feelings, the real intelligence and wealth of the States\r\nrepudiate the unworthy sentiment, and deprecate any acts that could\r\npossibly lead to a collision between the two countries. Besides all\r\nwhich, there is that strong affinity between _£. s. d._ and dollars and\r\ncents, whereby so strong an influence is exercised over that commercial\r\nbody which constitutes no unimportant portion of the wealth and\r\nintelligence of both nations.\r\n\r\nIf the views I have taken be correct, it is indeed impossible to\r\nforeshadow the future of the United States; centuries must elapse ere it\r\ncan become sufficiently peopled to test the adaptation of its present\r\nform of government to a thickly populated country; in the meantime,\r\nthere seems scarcely a limit to her increase in wealth and prosperity.\r\nHer present gigantic stride among the nations of the world appears but\r\nan invisible atom, if compared with the boundless resources she\r\nencircles within her borders, not the least important of which is that\r\nmass of energy and intelligence she is, year by year, sowing broadcast\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of the land, the Church and the School\r\never following in the train, and reproducing those elements to which she\r\nowes her present proud position.\r\n\r\nMy task is now done. I have endeavoured, in the preceding pages, to\r\nconvey some general idea of the places I visited, and of the objects\r\nwhich appeared to me most worthy of notice. I have touched but lightly\r\non Cuba, and I have not dwelt at any great length on the prosperous and\r\nrising colony of Canada. My remarks have been chiefly on the United\r\nStates, which, differing in so many points from, the country of her\r\nbirth, and occupying so conspicuous a place among the nations, presented\r\nthe most extended field for observation and comment. I have on all\r\noccasions stated plainly the impressions produced upon my mind. I have\r\nfreely remarked upon all those topics which, being public, I conceive to\r\nbe the legitimate field for a traveller's criticism; where I have\r\npraised, or where I have condemned, I have equally endeavoured to\r\nexplain my reasons. I have called attention to facts and opinions\r\nconnected with my own country, where I thought similar points in the\r\nRepublic might help to throw light upon them. Lastly, I have endeavoured\r\nto explain the various causes by which hostile feelings towards this\r\ncountry are engendered and spread abroad among a certain portion of the\r\ncommunity; and I have stated my firm conviction, that the majority of\r\nthe highest order of intelligence and character entertain a sincere\r\ndesire to perpetuate our present friendly relations.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would observe, that the opinions and feelings of a\r\nnation should not be hastily drawn from the writings of a passing\r\ntraveller, or from the casual leaders of a Free Press. Man is ever prone\r\nto find fault with his neighbour, because the so doing involves a latent\r\nclaim to superior intelligence in himself; but a man may condemn many\r\nthings in a nation, while holding the nation itself in high esteem. The\r\nworld is a large society,--a traveller is but one of the company, who\r\nconverses through the Press; and as, in the smaller circles,\r\nconversation would die or freeze if nothing were stated but what could\r\nbe mathematically proved, so would volumes of travels come to an\r\nuntimely end, if they never passed beyond the dull boundary of facts. In\r\nboth cases, opinions are the life of conversation; because, as no two\r\npeople agree, they provoke discussion, through the openings of which, as\r\ntruth oozes out, wise men catch it, leaving the refuse to the\r\nunreflecting.\r\n\r\nThe late Lord Holland, who was equally remarkable for his kindness and\r\nhis intelligence, is said to have observed, \"I never met a man so great\r\na fool, but what I could learn something from him.\" Reader, I am bound\r\nto confess his Lordship never met me; but I cannot take my leave without\r\nexpressing a hope, that you will not be less fortunate than that\r\namiable Peer.\r\n\r\nAnd now, farewell, thou Giant Republic! I have long since left thy\r\nshores; but I have brought with me, and fondly cherish, the recollection\r\nof the many pleasant days I spent within thy borders, and of all those\r\nfriends whose unceasing hospitality and kindness tracked my path without\r\nintermission. I care not for the Filibusteros and Russian sympathizers;\r\nI know that the heart of the intelligence of thy people beats with\r\nfriendly pulsations, to which that of my own countrymen readily\r\nresponds. All we should, and I trust all we do, mutually desire, is, to\r\nencourage an honourable and increasing rivalry in arts, science,\r\ncommerce, and good-will. He who would disturb our amicable relations, be\r\nhe Briton or American, is unworthy of the name of a man; for he is a foe\r\nto Liberty--Humanity--and Christianity.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote CK: The _New York Herald_ is edited by two renegade British\r\nsubjects, one of whom was, I am told, formerly a writer in a scurrilous\r\npublication in this country.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote CL: It has been cited as an example of their fondness for\r\ngrand-sounding titles, that while, by the Census of Great Britain, there\r\nwere only 2,328 physicians to 15,163 surgeons, in the United States\r\nthere were 40,564 physicians to only 191 surgeons.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote CM: _Vide_ chapter entitled \"America's Press and England's\r\nCensor.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote CN: One of the few cases in which perhaps there is an\r\nadvantage in the masses voting, is where a question of public advantage\r\nis brought forward, to which many and powerful local interests or\r\nmonopolies are opposed.

Experience now enables it to be done for 50l., and that in\r\na far more durable and efficient manner than is practised in the United\r\nStates. The cost of laying down a submarine telegraph is stated to be\r\nabout 230l. per mile for six wires, and 110l. for single wires.\r\n\r\nOne feature in which the telegraphs of Great Britain differ materially\r\nfrom those of America and all other countries, is, the great extent of\r\nunderground lines. There are nearly 17,000 miles of wire placed\r\nunderground in England, the cost of which is six times greater than that\r\nof overground lines; but it has the inestimable advantage of being never\r\ninterrupted by changes of weather or by accidents, while the cost of its\r\nmaintenance is extremely small. This fact must be borne in mind, when\r\nwe come to consider the relative expense of the transmission of messages\r\nin England and the States.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing lines we have shown, that England possesses, miles of\r\nline, 8,298; miles of wire, 44,845; the United States possesses, miles\r\nof lines, 16,735; miles of wire, 23,281.\r\n\r\nWe thus see, that the telegraph in the United States extends over more\r\nthan twice as much ground as the British lines; while on the other hand\r\nthe system of telegraph in England is so much more fully developed, that\r\nnearly double the quantity of wire is in actual use. On the English\r\nlines, which are in the hands of three companies only, from 25,000 to\r\n30,000 miles are worked on Cook and Wheatstone's system; 10,000 on the\r\nmagnetic system--without batteries;--3000 on Bain's chemical\r\nprinciple--which is rapidly extending;--and the remainder on Morse's\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nThe price of the transmission of messages is less in America than in\r\nEngland, especially if we regard the distance of transmission. In\r\nAmerica a message is limited to ten words; in England to twenty words;\r\nand the message is delivered free within a certain distance from the\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nIn both countries the names and addresses of the sender and receiver are\r\nsent free of charge. The average cost of transmission from London to\r\nevery station in Great Britain is 13/10 of a penny per word per 100\r\nmiles. The average cost from Washington to all the principal towns in\r\nAmerica is about 6/10 of a penny per word per 100 miles. The ordinary\r\nscale of charges for twenty words in England is 1s. for fifty miles\r\nand under; 2s. 6d. between fifty miles and 100 miles; all distances\r\nbeyond that, 5s. with a few exceptions, where there is great\r\ncompetition. Having received the foregoing statement from a most\r\ncompetent authority, its accuracy may be confidently relied upon.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would observe that the competition which is gradually\r\ngrowing up in this country must eventually compel a reduction of the\r\npresent charges; but even before that desirable opposition arrives, the\r\ncompanies would, in my humble opinion, exercise a wise and profitable\r\ndiscretion by modifying their present system of charges. Originally the\r\naddresses of both parties were included in the number of words allowed;\r\nthat absurdity is now given up, but one scarcely less ridiculous still\r\nremains--viz., twenty words being the shortest message upon which their\r\ncharges are based. A merchant in New York can send a message to New\r\nOrleans, a distance of 2000 miles, and transact important business in\r\nten words--say \"Buy me a thousand bales of cotton--ship to Liverpool;\"\r\nbut if I want to telegraph from Windsor to London a distance of twenty\r\nmiles, \"Send me my portmanteau,\" I must pay for twenty words. Surely\r\ntelegraph companies would show a sound discretion by lowering the scale\r\nto ten words, and charging two-thirds of the present price for twenty.\r\nOpposition would soon compel such a manifestly useful change; but,\r\nindependent of all coercion, I believe those companies that strive the\r\nmost to meet the reasonable demands of the public will always show the\r\nbest balance-sheet at the end of the year.--Thirteenpence is more than\r\none shilling.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE II.\r\n\r\n_A short Sketch of the Progress of Fire-arms._\r\n\r\nThe first clear notice which we have of rifles is in the year 1498,\r\nnearly 120 years after the invention of gunpowder was known to Europe.\r\nThe Chinese, I believe, claim the invention 3000 years before the\r\nCreation. The first rifle-maker was one Zugler, in Germany, and his\r\noriginal object appears to have been merely to make the balls more\r\nragged, so as to inflict more serious wounds; a result produced before\r\nthat time by biting and hacking the balls. This appears clearly to have\r\nbeen the intention, inasmuch as the cuts were made perfectly straight in\r\nthe first instance. The accurate dates of the introduction of the\r\nvarious twists I have not been able to ascertain.\r\n\r\nI can find no mention of breech-loading arms before the reign of Henry\r\nVIII., since which time they have been constantly used in China and\r\nother parts of the East. In 1839, they were, I understand, extensively\r\nused in Norway. A breech-loading carbine, lately brought across to this\r\ncountry from America as the invention of Mr. Sharpe, was patented by a\r\nMr. Melville, of London, as far back as 1838. I understand Mr. Sharpe's\r\ncarbine was tried at Woolwich not long ago, and found to clog, owing to\r\nthe expansion of the metal from consecutive firing. Nor has any\r\nbreech-loading weapon hitherto introduced been able to make its way into\r\nextensive practical use, although the Americans have constantly used\r\nthem in their navy for some years past. To return to ancient\r\ntimes.--There is a matchlock in the Tower of London with one barrel and\r\na revolving breech cylinder which was made in the fifteenth century, and\r\nthere is a pistol on a similar plan, and dating from Henry VIII., which\r\nmay be seen in the Rotunda at Woolwich. The cylinders of both of these\r\nweapons were worked by hand.\r\n\r\nThe old matchlock, invented in 1471, gave way to a substitute scarcely\r\nless clumsy, and known by the initiated as the wheel-lock, the ignition\r\ntaking place by the motion of the steel wheel against a fixed flint\r\nplaced in the midst of the priming. This crude idea originated in 1530,\r\nand reigned undisputed until the invention of the common old flint and\r\nsteel, about the year 1692, when this latter became lord paramount,\r\nwhich it still remains with some infatuated old gentlemen, in spite of\r\nthe beautiful discovery of the application of fulminating powder, as a\r\nmeans of producing the discharge.\r\n\r\nMr. Forsyth patented this invention in 1807, but, whether from prejudice\r\nor want of perfection in its application, no general use was made of the\r\ncopper cap until it was introduced among sportsmen by Mr. Egg, in 1818,\r\nand subsequently Mr. J. Manton patented his percussion tubes for a\r\nsimilar purpose. The use of the copper cap in the army dates 1842, or\r\nnearly a quarter of a century after its manifest advantages had been\r\napparent to the rest of the community.\r\n\r\nPrevious to this invention it was impossible to make revolving weapons\r\npractically available for general use.\r\n\r\nThe public are indebted to Mr. Jones for the ingenious mechanism by\r\nwhich continuous pressure on the trigger causes both the revolution of\r\nthe barrels and the discharge of the piece; this patent goes back to\r\n1829-1830. Colonel Colt first endeavoured to make a number of barrels\r\nrevolve by raising the hammer, but the weight of the barrels suggested a\r\nreturn to the old rotatory cylinder, for which he took out a patent in\r\n1835; and in 1836 he took out another patent for obtaining the rotatory\r\nmotion by drawing back the trigger, and he subsequently introduced the\r\naddition of a lever ramrod fixed on to the barrel. Col. Colt came to the\r\nconclusion that the hammer-revolving cylinder was the more useful\r\narticle, inasmuch as it enabled the person using it to take a more\r\nsteady aim than with the other, which, revolving and firing by the\r\naction of the trigger, the moment of explosion could not be depended\r\nupon. To Col. Colt belongs the honour of so combining obsolete and\r\nmodern inventions, and superadding such improvements of his own, as to\r\nproduce the first practical and really serviceable weapon.\r\n\r\nSince then Messrs. Dean and Adams, in 1852, revived the old invention of\r\nthe trigger-revolving cylinder, which has the advantage of only\r\nrequiring one hand to fire, but which is immeasurably inferior where\r\naccuracy of aim is wanted. Mr. Tranter, in 1853, patented a new\r\ninvention, which, by employing a double trigger, combines the advantages\r\nof Colt and avoids the drawbacks of Dean and Adams. By a side-wind he\r\nhas also adapted that invaluable application of Colt's--a fixed lever\r\nramrod. Many other patents are springing up daily, too numerous to\r\nmention, and too similar to admit of easy definition.\r\n\r\nTo return to rifles.--It is well known that the ordinary rifle in use\r\nuntil late years was the seven-grooved, with a spherical ball, and the\r\ntwo-grooved, with a zone bullet; the latter an invention known as the\r\nBrunswick rifle; and imported from Berlin about 1836. It was upon this\r\nweapon Mr. Lancaster proceeded to make some very ingenious experiments,\r\nwidening the grooves gradually until at last they met, and an elliptic\r\nbore rifle was produced, for which he obtained a patent in July, 1850;\r\nbut upon investigation it would be proved that Mr. Lancaster's patent\r\nwas invalid, inasmuch as the elliptical bore rifle is of so ancient a\r\ndate that it is mentioned in _Scloppetaria_--a work printed in 1808--as\r\neven then obsolete; the details, methods, and instruments for their\r\nfabrication are fully described therein; and I have seen a rifle of this\r\nkind, made by \"Dumazin, à Paris,\" which is at least a century old; it is\r\nnow in the possession of the Duke of Athole. Mr. Lancaster is entitled\r\nto the credit of bringing into practical use what others had thrown on\r\none side as valueless.\r\n\r\nFrom rifles I turn to balls, in which the chief feature of improvement\r\nis the introduction of the conical shape. The question of a conical ball\r\nwith a saucer base is fully discussed in _Scloppetaria_, but no\r\npractical result seems to have been before the public until Monsieur\r\nDelvigue, in 1828, employed a solid conical ball, which, resting on the\r\nbreech clear of the powder, he expanded by several blows with the ramrod\r\nsufficiently to make it take the grooves. Colonel Thouvenin introduced a\r\nsteel spire into the breech, upon which the ball being forced, it\r\nexpanded more readily. This spire is called the \"tige.\" Colonel Tamisier\r\ncut three rings into the cylindrical surface of the bullet, to\r\nfacilitate the expansion and improve its flight. These three\r\ncombinations constitute the _Carabine à Tige_ now in general use in the\r\nFrench army. Captain Minié--in, I believe, 1850--dispensed with the\r\ntige, and employed a conical hollow in the ball; into which, introducing\r\nan iron cup, the explosion of the powder produced the expansion\r\nrequisite. As Captain Minié has made no change in the rifle, except\r\nremoving a tige which was only lately introduced, it is certainly an\r\nextraordinary Irishism to call his conical ball a Minié rifle; it was\r\npartially adopted in England as early as 1851. Why his invention has not\r\nbeen taken up in France, I cannot say.\r\n\r\nMiraculous to remark, the British Government for once appear to have\r\nappreciated a useful invention, and various experiments with the Minié\r\nball were carried on with an energy so unusual as to be startling. It\r\nbeing discovered that the iron cup had various disadvantages, besides\r\nbeing a compound article, a tornado of inventions rushed in upon the\r\nGovernment with every variety of modification. The successful competitor\r\nof this countless host was Mr. Pritchett, who, while dispensing with the\r\ncup entirely, produced the most satisfactory results with a simple\r\nconical bullet imperceptibly saucered out in the base, and which is now\r\nthe generally adopted bullet in Her Majesty's service. The reader will\r\nrecognise in Mr. Pritchett's bullet a small modification of the conical\r\nball alluded to in _Scloppetaria_ nearly fifty years ago.\r\n\r\nThrough the kindness of a friend, I have been able to get some\r\ninformation as to the vexed question of the Minié ball, which militates\r\nagainst some of the claims of the French captain, if invention be one.\r\nThe character of the friend through whom I have been put in\r\ncorrespondence with the gentleman named below, I feel to be a sufficient\r\nguarantee for the truthfulness of the statements which I here subjoin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMr. Stanton, a proprietor of collieries at Newcastle-on-Tyne, conceived\r\nthe idea that if a bullet were made to receive the projectile force in\r\nthe interior of the bullet, but beyond the centre of gravity, it would\r\ncontinue its flight without deviation. Having satisfied himself of the\r\ntruth of this theory, he sent the mould to the Board of Ordnance on the\r\n20th of January, 1797, and received a reply the following month, stating\r\nthat upon trial it was found to be less accurate in its flight and less\r\npowerful in its penetration than the round bullet then in use. They also\r\ninformed Mr. Stanton that there were some conical balls in the\r\nrepository which had been deposited there by the late Lieutenant-General\r\nParker, and which, having more solidity, were superior to those sent by\r\nMr. Stanton, thus proving that the idea of a conical expanding ball is\r\nof very ancient date. The mould sent to the Ordnance by Mr. Stanton was\r\ntaken from a wooden model, of which the accompanying is an exact\r\ndiagram, and which is in the possession of Mr. Stanton, solicitor, at\r\nNewcastle, the son of the originator. Evidence is afforded that Mr. Boyd\r\na banker, and Mr. Stanton, sen., both tried the ball with very different\r\nsuccess to that obtained at Woolwich; but this need excite no\r\nastonishment, as every sportsman is aware of the wonderful difference in\r\nthe accuracy with which smooth-bored fire-arms carry balls, and for\r\nwhich no satisfactory reason has ever been advanced. Mr. Kell was\r\nsubsequently present when his friend Mr. Stanton, jun., had balls made\r\non his father's principle for a pair of Wogden's pistols thirty years\r\nago; the result is reported as satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn 1829, Mr. Kell conceived the idea of applying the principle to\r\nrifles, for which purpose he had a mould made by Mr. Thomas Bulcraig.\r\nMr. Kell altered the original ball in two points; he made the sides\r\nstronger, and he formed the front of the ball conoidical instead of\r\nhemispherical. I have the ball made from that mould now lying before me,\r\nand it is precisely the same as the Minié ball without the iron cup,\r\nwhich we have shown in the preceding pages is totally unnecessary. This\r\nball has been constantly in use by Mr. Kell and others until the present\r\nday; it is the first application of a conical expanding ball to rifles\r\nthat I can find on record, and whatever credit is due to the person who\r\ntransferred the expanding ball from a smooth bore wherein it was\r\nuseless, to a rifle wherein it is now proved to be invaluable, belongs,\r\nas far as I can trace the application back, to Mr. Kell, A.D. 1829.\r\n\r\nIn 1830, Mr. Kell employed Mr. Greener, then a gunmaker at Newcastle, to\r\nmake him a mould for a double pea rifle, and he left in Mr. Greener's\r\nhands one of the balls made for the Wogden pistol, and one of those made\r\nby Mr. Bulcraig, to assist him in so doing. It appears that Mr. Greener\r\nmust have been satisfied with the success attending Mr. Kell's\r\napplication of the conical ball to a rifle, for some years after, in\r\nAugust, 1836, he applied to the Ordnance for permission to have a trial\r\nof the conical ball made; this was granted, and the experiment was\r\nconducted under Major Walcott of the Royal Artillery, on the sands near\r\nTynemouth Castle, the firing party consisting of a company of the 60th\r\nRifles. Mr. Greener having failed to bring a target, to test the\r\nsuperior penetrating power of his balls, the ordinary Artillery target\r\nwas used. Mr. Greener's ball had a conical plug of lead in the hollow,\r\nfor the purpose of producing the expansion when driven home by the force\r\nof the powder. After firing several rounds at two hundred yards, only\r\none ball of Mr. Greener's, which had struck the target, was found to\r\nhave the plug driven home, the others had all lost their plugs. The same\r\neffect was produced when firing into a sand-bank. A trial was then made\r\nat 350 yards; the spherical balls and the conical balls both went home\r\nto the target, but only one of the latter penetrated.\r\n\r\nThe objections pointed out to the conical ball were: the frequent loss\r\nof the plug, by which its weight was diminished; the inconvenience of\r\nhaving a hall composed of two separate parts; the difficulty of loading\r\nif the plug was not placed accurately in the centre; and the danger of\r\nthe plug losing its place in consequence of being put in loosely,\r\nespecially when carried about for any length of time in a\r\ncartridge.--Mr. Greener loaded the rifles during the trial with the ball\r\nand powder separate, not in cartridge.--The advantage admitted was,\r\nmerely, rapidity of loading if the plug was fairly placed: no\r\nsuperiority of range appears to have been produced over the rifles used\r\nby the 60th Regiment. Mr. Greener solicited another trial, but after\r\nthe report of Major Walcott, the Select Committee considering the ball\r\n\"useless and chimerical,\" no further trial was accorded. The conical\r\nball question was thus once more doomed to oblivion.\r\n\r\nIn process of time the fabulous ranges of the \"_Carabine à Tige_\" were\r\nheard of, and when it was ascertained that the French riflemen potted\r\nthe gunners on the ramparts of Rome with such rapidity that they could\r\nnot stand to their guns before a rifle nearly a mile distant, the cone\r\nshape once more turned up, and Captain Minié came forward as the\r\nchampion of the old expanding ball. The toscin of war was sounded in the\r\nEast; the public were crying aloud for British arms to be put upon an\r\nequality with those of foreign armies; the veterans who had earned their\r\nlaurels under poor old \"Brown Bess\" stuck faithfully to her in her\r\ndeath-struggle, and dropped a tear over the triumph of new-fangled\r\nnotions.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of last century Lieutenant-General Parker's ball was\r\nthrown aside; at the end of the century, Mr. Stanton's shared the same\r\nfate; Mr. Greener's followed in 1836 with equal ill success; Captain\r\nMinié's had a short reign, and was in turn superseded by the more solid\r\nand superior ball now in use, and for which the country is indebted to\r\nthe experimental perseverance of Mr. Pritchett; and if ever things\r\nobtain their right names, the weapon of the British army will be called\r\nthe Pritchett ball and not the Minié rifle; but as the world persists in\r\ncalling the Missouri the Mississippi, I suppose the British public will\r\nbehave equally shabbily by Mr. Pritchett. The reader will judge for\r\nhimself of the respective credit due to the various persons through\r\nwhose ingenuity we have at length succeeded in obtaining the present\r\nefficient ball, the wounds from which are more frightful than pen can\r\nportray.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one lesson which we should learn from the great\r\nopposition there has been to the introduction of the conical ball, and\r\nthat is, the advantage of remodelling the department to which such\r\ninventions are referred. The foregoing remarks appear to me conclusive\r\nevidence that the testing of fire-arms should not be left to age and\r\nexperience alone. Prejudice is all but inseparable from age--young and\r\nfresh blood is a powerful auxiliary. What I would suggest is, that there\r\nshould be a special examination to qualify officers of the engineers and\r\nartillery to sit in judgment on so important a subject as arms and\r\nmissiles; and I would then propose that two officers of the former\r\ncorps, and five of the latter, be selected from those below the rank of\r\nfield-officer, to form a separate and junior Board, and that each Board\r\nshould send in its own report. The method of selection which I would\r\nsuggest is by ballot or vote of those Officers of the same rank in their\r\nrespective corps; for I feel sure that those who live most together are\r\nthe best acquainted with one another's talents. If two Boards are\r\nobjectionable, form one Board, of which one-half shall be of the junior\r\nrank; and if they be equally divided in opinion, let the higher\r\nauthority appoint an umpire and order a second trial.\r\n\r\nRemember how long the now all-but-forgotten \"Brown Bess\" kept the field\r\nagainst the adversary which has since proved her immeasurable superior;\r\nand let the future prove that past experience has not been entirely\r\nthrown away. Trials may be troublesome, but officers are paid for taking\r\ntrouble; and the ingenuity of inventors will always be quickened in\r\nproportion to the conviction that their inventions will receive a full\r\nand unprejudiced trial; and that, if their first shot at the target of\r\nSuccess be an outside ringer, they will not be denied a chance of\r\nthrowing another in the Bull's-eye.\r\n\r\nSince the foregoing remarks went to press, it appears that the Pritchett\r\nball has been found wanting, both in England and in the Crimea; its\r\nflight is said to be irregular, and the deposit of lead in the barrel so\r\ngreat that after thirty rounds the charge cannot be got down. If this be\r\nso, it is only one more proof of the necessity for some improvement in\r\nthe Board appointed to judge of and superintend warlike missiles.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Pritchett had perfected his ball, it was tried in the\r\nthree-groove rifle, for which it was intended, with the most\r\nsatisfactory results, and was fired an indefinite number of times\r\nwithout the slightest difficulty. It appears, however, that this\r\nsuccessful trial was not sufficient to satisfy the new-born zeal of the\r\nauthorities. Accordingly, a conclave of gunmakers was consulted previous\r\nto the order for manufacturing being sent to Enfield; but with a depth\r\nof wisdom far beyond human penetration, they never asked the opinion of\r\nMr. Pritchett, who had made the rifle which had carried the ball so\r\nsatisfactorily.\r\n\r\nThe wise men decided that it would be an improvement if the grooves were\r\ndeepened--a strange decision, when all the experience of the day tends\r\nto prove that the shallower the groove the better. Down went the order;\r\nthe improved rifles were made as fast as possible, and in the month of\r\nMarch they went to the seat of war. May is hardly passed by, and the sad\r\nfact discovered in the Crimea is echoed back on our shores, that after\r\nthirty rounds the soldiers may right about face or trust to cold steel.\r\nI think my youngest boy--if I had one--would have suggested testing the\r\nimprovement before indulging the army with the weapon. Perhaps the\r\nauthorities went on the principle that a rifle is a rifle, and a ball is\r\na ball, and therefore that it must be all right. It might as well be\r\nsaid a chancellor is a chancellor, and a black dose is a black dose;\r\ntherefore, because an able Aesculapius had prescribed a draught which\r\nhad proved eminently useful to bilious Benjamin, it must agree equally\r\nwell with lymphatic William.--Never mind, my dear John Bull, sixpence\r\nmore in the pound Income-tax will remedy the little oversight.\r\n\r\nThree years have elapsed since these observations were penned, and\r\nbehold a giant competitor has entered the field, threatening utter\r\nannihilation to the three-groove (or Enfield) rifle and the Pritchett\r\nball. Mr. Whitworth (whose mechanical powers have realized an accuracy\r\nalmost fabulous), after a long course of experiments made at the\r\nGovernment's expence, has produced a rifle with an hexagonal box and\r\nball, the correctness of which, at 1100 yards, has proved nearly equal\r\nto that of the Enfield at 500 yards, and possessing a penetrating power\r\nof wonderful superiority; the Enfield rifle ball scarcely penetrated 13\r\nhalf-inch Elm planks. Whitworth's hexagonal ball penetrated 33, and\r\nburied itself in the solid block of wood behind. It remains to be seen\r\nwhether this formidable weapon can be made at such a price as to render\r\nit available for military purposes. The hexagonal bore is not a new\r\ninvention, some of the Russians having used it in the late Baltic\r\ncampaign; but it is doubtless Mr. Whitworth's wonderful accuracy of\r\nconstruction that is destined to give it celebrity, by arming it with a\r\npower and correctness it wanted before.[CQ] An explosive ball has also\r\nbeen introduced by Colonel Jacob of Eastern celebrity, which from its\r\ngreater flight will prove, when perfected, a more deadly arm than the\r\nold spherical explosive ball invented and forgotten years ago. With the\r\ndaily improvements in science, we may soon expect to see Colonel Jacob's\r\nin general use, unless the same principle applied to Whitworth's\r\nhexagonal ball should be found preferable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo those who are amateurs of the rifle, I would recommend a pamphlet,\r\nwritten by Chapman, and published in New York; it is chiefly intended\r\nfor those who delight in the infantine or octogenarian amusement of\r\npeppering a target, but it also contains many points of interest. Among\r\nother subjects discussed are the following:--The quantity of twist\r\nrequisite in a rifle barrel--the gaining twist, as opposed to Mr.\r\nGreener, and the decreasing twist--the size of ball best suited to\r\ndifferent distances--the swedge, by which a ball, being cast rather\r\nlarger than requisite, is compressed into a more solid mass--the powder\r\nto use, decreasing in size of the grain in proportion to the diminishing\r\nlength of barrel--the loading muzzle, by which the lips of the grooves\r\nare preserved as sharp as a razor, &c. The pamphlet can easily be\r\nprocured through Messrs. Appleton, of New York and London.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote CP: The miles of distance may not be quite exact, but the\r\nmiles of wire may be depended upon.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote CQ: The trial between the Enfield and the Whitworth rifles\r\ncannot be yet considered conclusive, as there was a difference in the\r\nbore of the rifles, and also Mr. Whitworth used a different kind of ball\r\nfor penetration to that used for long range.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Lands of the Slave and the Free, by Henry A.
