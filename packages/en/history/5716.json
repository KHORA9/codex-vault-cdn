Immediately after my birth, and as soon as the\r\nChancellor of France, M. Dambray, had declared me to be a boy, I was\r\nmade over to the care of a wet nurse and another attendant. Three years\r\nlater I passed out of female hands, earlier, somewhat, than is\r\ngenerally the case, for a little accident befell my nurse, in which my\r\neldest brother's tutor, an unfrocked priest, as he was then discovered\r\nto be, was also concerned. My earliest memory, and a very hazy one it\r\nis, mixed up with some story or other about a parrot, is of having seen\r\nmy grandmother, the Duchesse d'Orleans-Penthievre, at Ivry. After that\r\nI recollect being at the Chateau of Meudon with my great-aunt, the\r\nDuchesse de Bourbon, a tiny little woman; and being taken to see the\r\nPrincesse Louise de Conde at the Temple, and then I remember seeing\r\nTalma act in Charles the Bold, and the great impression his gilt\r\ncuirass made upon me.\r\n\r\nBut the first event that really is exceedingly clear in my recollection\r\nis a family dinner given by Louis XVIII. at the Tuileries on Twelfth\r\nNight, 1824. Even now, sixty-six years after, I can see every detail of\r\nthat party, as if it had been yesterday. Our arrival in the courtyard\r\nof the Tuileries, under the salute of the Swiss Guard at the Pavillon\r\nMarsan and the King's Guard at the Pavillon de Flore. Our getting out\r\nof the carriage under the porch of the stone staircase to the deafening\r\nrattle of the drums of the Cent Suisses. Then my huge astonishment when\r\nwe had to stand aside halfway up the stairs, to let \"La viande du Roi,\"\r\nin other words, his Majesty's dinner, pass by, as it was being carried\r\nup from the kitchen to the first floor, escorted by his bodyguard.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the stairs we were received by a red-coated Steward of\r\nthe Household, who, as I was told, bore the name of de Cosse, and,\r\ncrossing the Salle des Gardes, we were ushered into the drawing-room,\r\nwhere the whole family soon assembled: to wit, Monsieur, who afterwards\r\nbecame Charles X., the Duc and Duchesse d'Angouleme, the Duchesse de\r\nBerri, my father and mother, my aunt Adelaide, my two elder brothers,\r\nChartres and Nemours, my three sisters, Louise, Marie, and Clementine,\r\nand last and youngest of all, myself. There was only one person present\r\nwho did not belong to the Royal House of France, and that was the\r\nPrince de Carignan, afterwards known as Charles Albert, a tall, thin,\r\nsevere-looking person. He had just served in the ranks of the French\r\narmy, with all the proverbial valour of his race, through the Spanish\r\ncampaign of 1823, and he wore on his uniform that evening the worsted\r\nepaulettes given him on the field of battle by the men of the 4th\r\nRegiment of the Guard, with whom he had fought in the assault on the\r\nTrocadero. Presently the door of the King's study opened, and Louis\r\nXVIII. appeared, in his wheeled chair, with that handsome white head\r\nand in the blue uniform with epaulettes which the pictures of him have\r\nrendered so familiar. He kissed each of us in our turn, without\r\nspeaking to any of us except my brother Nemours, whom he questioned\r\nabout his Latin lessons. Nemours began to stammer, and was only saved\r\nfrom disgrace by the opportune entrance of the Prince de Carignan.\r\n\r\nAt dinner the Twelfth Night customs were duly observed, and when I\r\nbroke my cake I found the bean within it. I must confess the fact had\r\nnot been altogether unforeseen, and my mother had consequently primed\r\nme as to my behaviour. This did not prevent me from feeling heartily\r\nshy when I saw every eye fixed on me. I got up from the table, and\r\ncarried the bean on a salver to the Duchesse d'Angouleme. I loved her\r\ndearly even then, that good kind Duchess! for she had always been so\r\ngood to us, ever since we were babies, and never failed to give us the\r\nmost beautiful New Year's gifts. My respectful affection deepened as I\r\ngrew old enough to realize her sorrows and the nobility of her nature,\r\nand I was always glad, after we were separated by the events of 1830,\r\nto take every opportunity of letting her know how unalterable my\r\nfeelings for her were. She broke the ice by being the first to raise\r\nher glass to her lips, when I had made her my queen, and Louis XVIII.\r\nwas the first to exclaim, \"The Queen drinks.\" A few months later the\r\nking was dead, and I watched his funeral procession from the windows of\r\nthe Fire Brigade Station in the Rue de la Paix, as it passed on its way\r\nto Saint-Denis.\r\n\r\nThen came the echo of the excitement caused by the coronation of\r\nCharles X., that great ceremonial of which the Cathedral of Rheims was\r\nthe scene, and which, coming as it did after all the horrors of the\r\nRevolution, gave rise to the sanguine hope that the ancient monarchy\r\nwould repair every disaster now, just as it had in the time of Charles\r\nVII. But our childish ideas were not of so far-reaching a nature. It\r\nwas the splendour displayed that interested us--the dresses, the\r\ncarriages, and so on, of the princes and ambassadors who came from all\r\nparts of the world to greet the opening of the new monarch's reign.\r\nNumbers of artists solicited my father's permission to do his portrait,\r\nin the gold and ermine robes of a prince of the blood which he wore at\r\nthe coronation, and our pet amusement at the time was to go and see\r\npapa \"sitting as Pharamond.\" I said Pharamond, like my elders, although\r\nmy own historical knowledge was of the most elementary description. To\r\nbe frank, I was exceedingly backward, and have always remained so. My\r\nmother had taught me to read, but beyond that I had reached the age of\r\nsix knowing nothing or hardly anything. But I was a very good rider and\r\nwent out alone on a pony Lord Bristol had given my father, which I rode\r\nboldly, and I might even say recklessly. The pony's name was Polynice.\r\nHe and I understood each other perfectly, and I was his friend to the\r\nlast. I took care he should end his days in the park at St. Cloud,\r\nwhere he roamed in freedom, with a stable of his own to retire into if\r\nthe fancy took him. Often and often I have been to see him, in that\r\nsame stable, which he ended by never leaving except to come and greet\r\nus, and warm himself in the sunshine. He died, there, fortunately for\r\nhimself, full of years, just before the pleasant revolutionary\r\noccurrences of 1848, in which he would certainly have had his share.\r\nBut my father desired me to be something more than a mere horseman. He\r\ngot me a tutor, and from that day out, for several years, my\r\nrecollections are divided, to the exclusion of everything else, between\r\nmy education and my life with my family. My tutor was called M.\r\nTrognon, and his name brought many a jest upon him, amongst others a\r\nline of Victor Hugo's in Ruy Bias about that\r\n\r\n Affreuse compagnonne,\r\n Dont la barbe fleurit et dont le nez trognonne.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Looks a little like a courtroom unfortunately without a\r\ncaption.]\r\n\r\n\"Fleurit\" was an allusion to Cuvillier-Fleury, my brother Aumale's\r\ntutor, and Victor Hugo thought he owed both the gentlemen a grudge. M.\r\nTrognon, a distinguished pupil of the Ecole Normale, had begun his\r\nteaching career as professor of rhetoric at the college at Langres,\r\nwhere, coming in one day to take his class, he found his desk occupied\r\nby a donkey, which his pupils had established in his seat \"Gentlemen,\"\r\nhe said as he went out, \"I leave you with a professor who is worthy of\r\nyou.\" Soon after, he was recalled to Paris, as assistant to M. Guizot\r\nin his courses of historical lectures at the College of France.\r\n\r\nHe was not only an accomplished university man, but something else\r\nbesides, as we learnt from a copy of the Figaro, which our eldest\r\nbrother brought back from college. In this newspaper we read, in fact,\r\na set of verses by Baour-Lormian, beginning thus:--\r\n\r\n Que me veut ce Trognon, pedagogue en besicles,\r\n Dans la fosse du Globe enterrant ses articles!\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about it. My tutor was a journalist, and these lines\r\na revengeful answer to an article of his in the Globe, a newspaper\r\nwhich, as we soon learnt, he had founded in concert with Pierre Leroux,\r\nDubois, Jouffroy, Remusat, and some others. We discovered too that our\r\njournalist was a freethinker as well, and author of a thick octavo book\r\nwhich had been condemned by the Index at Rome, a fact which did not\r\nprevent his dying in the most religious frame of mind possible, well\r\nnigh in the odour of sanctity. My tutor was, in truth, of too lofty an\r\nintelligence to persevere long in that religious nihilism, that denial\r\nof the existence of a future state, which, spreading from religion to\r\nfamily life, and from thence again to the affairs of the State, ends by\r\nleaving nothing standing but animal man and his animal passions and\r\nappetites. The long death-struggle of a passionately loved sister, who\r\nwas supported by the constant ministrations of the Bishop of Beauvais,\r\nM. Feutrier, and her calm end, of which he was an eyewitness, began the\r\nchange within him. When, in later years, the Abbe Dupanloup, then Vicar\r\nof the Church of the Assumption, was charged with the care of my\r\nreligious education, he and Trognon became very intimate, and death\r\nalone interrupted the close communion then established between these\r\ntwo great minds.\r\n\r\nThe first years of my education were very happy. Anything dry about it\r\nwas liberally compensated for by the constant intimacy of the family\r\ncircle. We were three sisters and six brothers (this last number soon\r\nreduced to five by the death of my brother Penthievre), all living\r\ntogether, eating together, often doing lessons together, together\r\nalways in all games and pleasure parties and excursions. What a joyous\r\nband we were may easily be guessed. Each boy had his own tutor, and two\r\ngovernesses were in charge of my sisters. So long as tutors and\r\ngovernesses only had to deal with their own pupils, all went well, but\r\nwhen the brothers and sisters were all together, and influenced by the\r\nspirit of insubordination and love of playing pranks which the elder\r\nones brought back from school, we made life hard and sour to the\r\npreceptorial body. But they got on, somehow. The GRANDSPARENTS, as we\r\ncalled our parents, taken up as they were by their social engagements,\r\nleft all initiative to the tutors. Each of these was only expected to\r\nenter daily in a book his report and opinion of the pupil committed to\r\nhis care. This book was seen by my father, and he added his own remarks\r\nand orders, and then returned it.\r\n\r\nOur day generally began at five o'clock in the morning. The elder ones\r\nwent to school to attend their classes, took their meals and played\r\nwith the boarders, and came home after evening school. The boys who\r\nwere not at school and the girls spent the day doing their lessons. In\r\nthe evening, pupils and teachers of both sexes all dined together, and\r\nthen went to the drawing-room, where there was always company, for my\r\nparents received every evening. Thursdays and Sundays, which were\r\nschool holidays, were given up specially to lessons in what were known\r\nas accomplishments: drawing, music, physical exercises, riding,\r\nfencing, singlestick, dancing, &c. On Sundays, every one, great and\r\nsmall, dined at \"THE GREAT TABLE,\" and this life of ours was as regular\r\nas clockwork summer and winter alike.\r\n\r\nIn winter time we lived in the Palais-Royal, which then was not at all\r\nwhat it is nowadays. Where the Galerie d'Orleans is now to be seen,\r\nthere were hideous wooden passages, with muddy floors, exclusively\r\noccupied by milliners' shops, and peopled, it was said, by thousands of\r\nrats. To get rid of this collection of shanties, they were sawn through\r\nbelow, and allowed to come down with a crash. Crowds of people came to\r\nwitness the collapse, in the hope of seeing the expected multitude of\r\nrats rush out. There was not a single one! They had all cleared out in\r\ngood time. Such is the wisdom of the brute creation!\r\n\r\nWhen I first lived at the Palais-Royal, I had a room in the Rue de\r\nValois, which overlooked the Boeuf a la Mode restaurant, and opposite\r\nthere dwelt an old lady, always dressed in black, who regularly every\r\nday, at the very same hour, placed an indispensable article of domestic\r\nuse upon her window-sill, so that it was as good as a clock to us.\r\nLater on, I changed my room for one looking over the courtyard, facing\r\nthe rooms occupied by an actor at the Comedie-Francaise named\r\nDumilatre, and his daughters; Dumilatre, whom I knew well, having seen\r\nhim play those small tragedy parts which consist in making a dignified\r\nexit and saying, \"Yes, my lord,\" had the same habits as my black lady,\r\nand the same object used to appear upon his window-sill with equal\r\nregularity. I had only changed my clock!\r\n\r\nIt was during the winter sojourn at the Palais-Royal, too, that our\r\nmasters and their lessons multiplied. And several of these masters were\r\noddities, amongst others our professor of German. Picture a little\r\nbland-mannered old man, dressed all in black, with satin breeches,\r\nwoollen stockings, enormous shoes, and a broad-brimmed hat. He had been\r\ntutor to Prince Metternich in his youth. I know not what chance had\r\nlater driven him into France--where, during the Terror, he became one\r\nof the secretaries of the much-dreaded Committee of Public Safety at\r\nStrasbourg. He lived alone with his daughter, whom he often sent to\r\nGermany, not by the ordinary means of communication, but concealed in\r\nthe van which was sent periodically into Hungary to fetch supplies of\r\nleeches for the hospitals, which circumstance made us conclude that the\r\nsimple name of \"Herr Simon\" by which he called himself probably\r\nconcealed some deep mystery. Nothing, alas! remains to me of his\r\nGerman, nor of that of a valet of the same race, who had been put about\r\nme, so ill adapted has my mental constitution always proved to any\r\nforeign language.\r\n\r\nAnother oddity was our dancing master, an Opera dancer, named Seuriot.\r\nWhat a fine presence that man had! His lesson, which we all took\r\ntogether, like a little corps de ballet, was a great amusement to us,\r\nespecially because of the theatrical stories we used to make him tell\r\nus. One day he arrived in a great state of excitement, and addressing\r\nthe governesses he said, \"Ladies, you see before you a man who had a\r\nremarkable escape yesterday. The ballet called Les Filets de Vulcain\r\nwas being danced, I was playing Jupiter, and I was just going to ascend\r\nin my glory, with Mercury beside me, when I felt that same glory was\r\nout of order, and I had only just time to jump off, and to shout to\r\nMercury, 'Jump, my friend, jump, don't lose an instant!' Well, well!\"\r\nDuring the pauses in the lesson, when his fiddle ceased, and while he\r\nwiped the perspiration from his brow, we used to crowd round him and\r\nask him questions. The elder ones always tried to get him on the\r\nsubject of a danseuse named Mademoiselle Legallois, one on which he\r\nwould descant unendingly. This was the lady who on one occasion\r\nappeared in a ballet as the allegorical representative of Religion,\r\nwhich fact caused it to be said of a certain [Illustration: Man and\r\nwoman dancing.] Marshal of France \"qu'il s'etait eteint dans les bras\r\nde la religion\" (that he had passed away peacefully in the arms of\r\nreligion). But the moment we were seen crowding round and whispering\r\nwith the old dancer, the governesses would charge down upon us with\r\ntheir \"What is it? What is it?\" and we began our BATTEMENTS and our\r\nsteps again. Personally I owed one of the earliest successes in my life\r\nto old Seuriot. I had profited so much by his lessons, that I appear to\r\nhave danced the minuet in a quite remarkable way, so much so that my\r\nparents had a complete crimson velvet dress in the style of the last\r\ncentury made for me, with the indispensable three-cornered hat and a\r\nsword with knots of ribbon. Thus accoutred, with powdered head and\r\npigtail, I had to give several performances of my minuet, which I\r\ndanced with my sister Clementine, both of us displaying all the airs\r\nand graces of bygone times. My marquis's dress, of which I was\r\nexcessively proud, served me also for a fancy dress ball given by the\r\nDuchesse de Berri, at which, identifying myself too much with my\r\ncharacter, I had a quarrel with a Cossack of my own age, young de B--\r\nabout a partner. In my fury I drew my sword, he did likewise, and we\r\nwere just falling on each other, when the Duchesse rushed up crying,\r\n\"Stop, you naughty children! Take their swords away, M. de Brissac!\" As\r\nfor my sister Clementine, who was at the ball too, wearing her minuet\r\ngown, and looking utterly bewitching in her powder and her looped-up\r\ndress, she attracted the notice of Charles X., to whom she doubtless\r\nbrought back memories of his own youth. He came to her and kissed her,\r\nand gazed at her for a long time, holding her hand. Then, turning to my\r\nfather, he said, \"Monsieur, if I were forty years younger, your\r\ndaughter should be Queen of France,\" whereupon he kissed her over again.\r\n\r\nOur dancing lessons, which were looked upon as recreation, alternated\r\nwith walks about Paris. The girls went in one direction, and the boys\r\nin another. When we went out thus, one tutor alone took the extra duty\r\nof looking after us. When it was Trognon who came out, we always\r\nexpected to be taken to Sautelet's, a bookseller in the Rue de\r\nRichelieu, whose establishment became, I recollect, in later days, the\r\nhead office of the NATIONAL. There Trognon would hold forth amongst the\r\njournalists, while the clerks talked to us. I remember their showing me\r\nthe splendid manuscript of the Memoirs of Saint-Simon, which Sautelet\r\nwas then publishing. When, on the other hand, it was Cuvillier-Fleury\r\nwho marshalled us, the objects of our walks became more varied, and we\r\nsoon began to discover that there was not unfrequently a petticoat\r\nsomewhere about. Yet I owe to him the precious memory of a visit to the\r\nstudio of Eugene Delacroix; and also of one to M. de Lavalette,\r\nPostmaster-General under the first Napoleon, a most interesting man,\r\nwell known for his celebrated escape on the eve of the day appointed\r\nfor his execution, after the Hundred Days, when his wife came and took\r\nhis place, and brought him garments to escape in. But oftenest of all\r\nwe used to go to a bookseller's in the Rue Saint-Andre-des-Arts, who\r\nwas a great friend of Fleury's, and we were always sure to find either\r\nhim or his charming wife at home.\r\n\r\nFleury's friendship for this bookseller was indeed the cause of a\r\ncomical adventure. In the confusion of the first few days of the\r\nRevolution of 1830, the gentleman in question appeared before us with\r\nwhite belt and a sword over his civilian's dress. \"Look here, Fleury,\"\r\nsaid he, \"what use can I be to you today?\" Fleury considered for a\r\nminute, and then he said he really didn't quite see, but that after all\r\nhe thought nobody had troubled their heads about the Prefecture of\r\nPolice. \"I'll be off there,\" said my bookseller, and off he went,\r\nappointed himself Prefect of Police, and performed all his functions\r\nfor several days. I have never heard of him since.\r\n\r\nTurn about with these walks, too, we had lessons in gymnastics, of\r\nwhich science a certain Colonel Amoros was the apostle. This worthy\r\ncolonel gave prizes to everybody, so as to make his classes popular.\r\nThese prizes took the form of collars, inscribed in large painted\r\nletters with the particular merit of the pupil rewarded, such as\r\nagility, courage, strength, &c. One pupil was given a prize for \"hidden\r\nvirtue.\" After the gymnastic lessons came riding lessons, for which we\r\nwere taken to the Cirque Olympique, I and my two elder brothers being\r\nalways put in the charge of a single tutor. But as he invariably found\r\nthe riding school too cold, he used to go and shut himself up in the\r\nmanager's room, and leave us to the tender care of Laurent Franconi and\r\nthe rough riders, which amounted to leaving us to ourselves. This icy\r\ncold arena, in the Place du Chateau-d'Eau consisted of one immense\r\nhall, where the place of the pit was taken up by the circus or riding\r\nschool for all sorts of horsemanship, which circus was connected with\r\nthe stage by inclined planes, whenever a military piece with battles in\r\nit was performed. In this circus Laurent Franconi made us practise \"la\r\nhaute ecole,\" and his assistants. Bassin and Lagoutte, taught us to\r\nvault on horseback, astride and sitting, and standing upright--after\r\nevery fashion, in fact. And to our great amusement, too, these lessons,\r\nfalling as they did on Sunday afternoons, generally coincided with the\r\nrehearsals on the stage, in which we joyfully took our share during the\r\nintervals we were allowed for rest, scaling the practicable scenery, or\r\ntaking part with the artists in certain interludes not mentioned on the\r\nprogramme. This was not indeed our only initiation into theatrical art,\r\na career bearing so much analogy to that of every prince. Taking\r\nadvantage of the close proximity of the Palais-Royal to the\r\nComedie-Francaise, my father had added a regular course of dramatic\r\nliterature to the educational plan he had laid out for us. So very\r\noften when the old stock plays were being given at the Francais, he\r\nwould take us by a door leading from his drawing-room into the passage\r\nwhich separates the side scenes from the artists' green-room, and leave\r\nus in his box--the three centre ones on the grand tier thrown\r\ntogether--returning to fetch us at the end of the performance. Those\r\nevenings at the Comedie-Francaise were our greatest joy, and taught us\r\nmany a useful lesson, filling our heads with classic literature far\r\nmore efficiently than all the reading and courses of lectures in the\r\nworld. But those unlucky classics were very much neglected. They were\r\nnot a bit the fashion. There would hardly be two hundred people in the\r\ntheatre, and all the boxes were empty. A wretched orchestra, conducted\r\nby a stout man of the name of Chodron, squeaked a tune that set\r\neverybody's teeth on edge. Up would go the curtain, without any\r\nwarning, in the very middle of some phrase in the music which would\r\nbreak off with a sigh from the clarionet, and drearily the play would\r\nbegin. We were all eyes and ears in spite of that, and nothing in the\r\nplay of the tragic actresses--Madame Duchesnois, Madame Paradol, and\r\nMadame Bourgoin--ever escaped us. I can see and hear yet all\r\nCorneille's plays, and Racine's too, and Zaire, and Mahomet, and\r\nL'Orphelin de la Chine, and many more. But what we longed for most\r\nimpatiently were Moliere's plays. They were our prime favourites, and\r\nwhat actors too! Monrose, Cartigny, Samson, Firmin, Menjaud, and Faure,\r\nwhose appearances as Fleurant in Le Malade and Truffaldin in L'Etourdi\r\nwe always greeted with delight, on account of the properties he carried\r\nin his hand. This same Faure, an old soldier of 1782, never failed to\r\nsay to my father, as he escorted him to the door, taper in hand, \"Ha,\r\nSir! this is not the camp at la Lune!\" referring to a bivouac just\r\nbefore the battle of Valmy. It was always a great amusement to us to go\r\nalong the passages behind the scenes, especially when the classic Roman\r\nprocessions were being formed up there for the tragedies, for among the\r\nlictors and the other Romans we recognized many of the clerks and\r\nworkmen employed about the Palais-Royal, and we used to bid them good\r\nday, and call them by their names, and be very proud indeed of speaking\r\nto artists, and we went home to our own fold, imitating the call in the\r\ntheatre: \"On va-a commmencer! On co-mmence!\" (Going to begin, just\r\nbeginning).Sometimes too we were taken to see modern plays, but that\r\ndid not happen often. Yet even now I seem to hear the actor Armand,\r\njust before 1830, talking thick behind his Directoire cravat, in TOM\r\nJONES:--\r\n\r\n Point d'amis, point de grace,\r\n A la session prochaine il faudra qu'on y passe!\r\n\r\nand the whole house rose at him! I remember also being taken to the\r\nfirst night of Henri III., and being very much amused by the cups and\r\nballs and the pea-shooters. I was much affected too by the death of\r\nArthur, a charming page in a violet dress, played by Mile. Despreaux,\r\nwho afterwards became Madame Allan. I had no eyes for anybody else. As\r\nwe were going away, my father leading me by the hand, we found the\r\nDuchesse de Guise, Mademoiselle Mars, panting, and wrapped in a\r\nrose-coloured satin cloak lined with swansdown, waiting for the\r\ncompliments which my father showered on her. She had not impressed me\r\nnearly so much as the page in violet.\r\n\r\nTalking of Henri III., a play we took great interest in, because its\r\nauthor, quite unknown at the time, belonged to our household, I will\r\nrecall here a recollection connected with the name of Alexandre Dumas.\r\nEverybody knows he began life as a clerk in my father's library at the\r\nPalais-Royal. The chief librarian was Vatout, whose works, and perhaps\r\ntoo some well-known songs, have gained him a seat in the Academy. But\r\nVatout was never in the library by any chance. The real librarian, and\r\na very worthy fellow he was, was a man of the name of Tallencourt. He\r\nwas an old soldier, and this caused him to be elected captain of a\r\ngrenadier company in the Citizen Guard--a position to which, in the\r\nfirst blush of his enthusiasm, he attached an exaggerated importance.\r\nWell, some time after Dumas had resigned his position in the library,\r\nin the midst of the riots which occurred so frequently about that\r\nperiod, we saw Tallencourt come home one day in full warlike attire,\r\nwith his bearskin cap and his cloak, and a very gloomy countenance.\r\n\"What do you think has just happened to me? I was in command of a patrol\r\nin my ward--as we had heard several shots, we were advancing with the\r\ngreatest caution, in double file, keeping close to the walls, with our\r\neyes and ears open. All at once I heard a shout--'Here's for you, de\r\nTallencourt!' and then a shot. Well, the shout--that voice--it was\r\nAlexandre Dumas' voice!\" \"Oh, nonsense!\" we all cried. But he stuck to\r\nit--and we resisted the violent inclination to laugh that assailed us,\r\nconvinced as we were that if the worthy man really had recognized the\r\nvoice, he had been the victim of a prank of Alexandre Dumas, who had\r\ndoubtless enjoyed the fun of seeing the rout of his former chief and\r\nhis brave \"guernadiers\"!\r\n\r\nWhen our father did not take us to the Theatre Francais, we spent our\r\nevenings in those beautiful rooms in the Palais-Royal where he had\r\ngathered together so many admirable pictures and works of art,\r\nplundered and dispersed since by the revolutionists and their tribe,\r\ntogether with the splendid furniture which was used to burn a\r\ndetachment of the 14th Regiment of the Line alive, on the 24th of\r\nFebruary, on which day it was on guard at the Palais-Royal. And to\r\nthink that a French Chamber actually voted national rewards to people\r\nwho had made an AUTO DA FE of French soldiers who were guilty of\r\ndefending till death the post which duty and honour at once made sacred\r\nto them! But let that pass; worse things happen nowadays, but at the\r\nhappy time I speak of nobody thought of the possibility of such\r\nshameful doings. This is what men call progress! As far as we ourselves\r\nwere concerned, we spent our evenings in all the carelessness of our\r\nyouth, playing together merrily and noisily in the family drawing-room,\r\na large gallery running from the courtyard to the Rue de Valois. The\r\ngames were liveliest on Sundays and Thursdays, because, those days\r\nbeing school holidays, our merry band was reinforced by my brothers'\r\nclass-mates, MM. de Laborderie, Guillermy, d'Eckmul, Albert, &c., &c.,\r\nand by Alfred de Mussetas well, whom I still seem to see, with his blue\r\ncoat and gilt buttons, his fair curly hair, and his melancholy and\r\nsomewhat affected ways. We generally played \"prisoners' base\"--a game\r\nto which the great gallery was very well suited. Sometimes there was\r\ndancing, and then my mother's eye was always on de Musset, who seemed\r\nto scorn our games and to be inclined to pay assiduous court to my big\r\nsisters.\r\n\r\nOur games never interfered with the coming and going of visitors and\r\nhabitual guests and old friends of my father's, who had been his\r\nfriends before the Revolution. There was the Duc de la Rochefoucauld,\r\n\"the good Duke,\" as he was called, very much dreaded by us children\r\nbecause he was always kissing us, and smelt so strongly of tobacco; and\r\nM. de Lally-Tollendal; and then friends of more recent date, General\r\nGerard, Raoul de Montmorency, Madame de Boigne, the Princesse de Poix,\r\nthe Princesse de Vaudemont, besides many others, soldiers, artists,\r\ndiplomats, and ladies--every one, in fact, who was distinguished either\r\nby their personal charm, by mental qualities, or by the brilliancy of\r\ntheir career. Some amongst the number were more congenial to me than\r\nothers; such as Francois Arago, the astronomer, inexhaustible in wit\r\nand humour, whether he was recounting his adventures when he was in\r\ncaptivity in the Barbary States, or the way he plagued his colleague\r\nAmpere, a soldier like himself in the regiment of the \"Parrots in\r\nmourning,\" as he dubbed the Institute, in his southern accent, because\r\nof its green and black uniform. And then Macdonald, Marmont, Molitor,\r\nand Mortier, the four Marshals whose name began with M, the heroes of a\r\nhundred fights, the living embodiment of the renown our arms had won.\r\nWe used all of us to try and hear whatever they said, whatever stories\r\nthey told, and to gather up any information or anecdote touching the\r\nmilitary glory of our country.\r\n\r\nThe diplomats interested us less--I will not speak of M. de Talleyrand,\r\nwhose face and figure were striking enough, though they made but little\r\nimpression on our uninformed imaginations. Yet I remember the fits of\r\nlaughter we went into one day, when my father, in a fit of absence,\r\naped the great man's limp as he crossed the drawing-room to receive\r\nhim. We delighted in Pozzo di Borgo, the Russian Ambassador, because as\r\nsoon as his burly presence appeared his jokes and witty sallies and his\r\nstories provoked loud and inexhaustible shouts of laughter. All\r\nchildren love cheery people. There was another diplomat whose arrival\r\nwe always looked forward to, the Bailli de Ferrette, Minister of the\r\nGrand Duke of Baden--and this for two reasons. First of all because of\r\nthat title of \"Bailli,\" which seemed to belong to another world, or at\r\nall events to a harlequinade, and then on account of the extraordinary\r\nappearance of the man--he looked like a skeleton in powder. We were\r\nquite ignorant in those days, it is needless to remark, of the fact\r\nthat this cool, proper-looking Bailli was a great musician, a\r\nfirst-class performer of the STABAT MATER, whose inspiration however\r\ndepended on his having the shoulders, very DECOLLETEE ones too, of a\r\ncharming nightingale, over whom the Opera and Opera-Comique fought for\r\nmany a day, as the desk he laid his music on. Sometimes when the\r\nevening was half over a bell was heard like the one in the fourth act\r\nof the HUGUENOTS. \"There's the big bell,\" we would cry. It was the\r\nsignal that Madame la Dauphine or Madame la Duchesse de Berri was\r\ncoming to pay us a visit, and my father would tear off, with all of us\r\nafter him, to receive the visitor on the staircase. But our season at\r\nthe Palais-Royal closed with the winter, and the first fine days saw us\r\nmigrate to Neuilly, to the general delight.\r\n\r\nNeuilly! I can never write the word without feeling moved, for it is\r\nbound up with all the happiest memories of my childhood, and I salute\r\nthat name with respect akin to that which I would show a dead man!\r\nThose who never knew the Neuilly of which I would speak must imagine to\r\nthemselves a very large country house, of no architectural pretension,\r\nconsisting almost exclusively of sets of ground-floor rooms, tacked one\r\non to the other on much the same level, with delightful gardens, and\r\nstanding in the middle of a very large park which stretched from the\r\nfortifications to the Seine, just where the Avenue Bineau now runs.\r\nWithin the park walls there were fields and woods and orchards, and\r\neven islands, the chief of which was called the \"Ile de la Grande\r\nJatte,\" and the whole of one reach of the Seine, the whole within a\r\nquarter of an hour's journey from Paris. This beautiful demesne, the\r\nfavourite residence of my father and mother, who had made it, and were\r\nalways adding new beauties to it, and who lived there in those days,\r\nfar from political cares, and surrounded by their many children, who\r\nwere all devoted to them, was also the place that we loved best. We\r\nwere so near town that our education, our masters, our lessons at home\r\nor in school, went on just as if we were in Paris, while we had the\r\nadvantage of fresh air and country life, with all its liberty and its\r\nnatural and spontaneous exercise. At five o'clock in the morning,\r\nbefore lessons or school began, we were galloping about in the big\r\npark. In play hours, and on the Thursday and Sunday holidays, the whole\r\ntroop of children roamed the fields, almost unaccompanied, the older\r\nones looking after the youngest. We used to make hay, and get on the\r\nhay-cocks, and dig potatoes, and climb the fruit-trees, and beat the\r\nwalnut-trees. There were flowers everywhere, fields of roses, where we\r\ngathered splendid bouquets every day, without their ever being missed\r\neven. Then we used to go boating and swimming. Boys and girls, equally\r\ngood swimmers all, would plunge in turn into the little arm of the\r\nSeine enclosed within the park, and nothing more delicious can be\r\nimagined than to cast oneself into deep water near the bridge at\r\nNeuilly, and to let oneself drift down almost as far as Asnieres, under\r\nthe great willows, returning afterwards on foot by the \"Ile de la\r\nGrande Jatte.\"\r\n\r\nThis island, laid waste now and turned into a slum, was covered then\r\nwith venerable trees, and intersected by those \"shady paths\" sung by\r\nGounod, in which we loved to lose ourselves in all the carelessness of\r\nour childhood, and perhaps too in the first awakening instincts of our\r\nyouth. Nothing but a memory remains of that enchanting spot. It was\r\nconfiscated by Napoleon III. on some flimsy pretext or other, and\r\nforthwith cut to pieces, so as to destroy every trace of those who had\r\nowned and lived in it. It is as much as I can do, as I drive along the\r\nAvenue Bineau, to find, among the villas which have been built all over\r\nit, some well-known tree or other, behind which I used to lie in wait\r\nto shoot the hares, which a big dog I had trained to the work used to\r\nput up for me As for the house itself, after being the scene of a\r\nterrible orgie, it was sacked and burnt down by the conquerors in the\r\nglorious fight of February 1848. Not a stone of it remains. All the\r\nworks of art within it were destroyed But I know of one stray bit saved\r\nfrom the wreck. The traveller who goes to see the museum at Neufchatel,\r\nin Switzerland, may observe, alongside of the picture which represents\r\nM. de Montmolin, an officer of the Swiss Guard, allowing himself to be\r\nmurdered on the 10th of August, sooner than give up the flag which was\r\nintrusted to his loyal care, a very small canvas, carefully mended up.\r\nThat fragment is the principal figure in Leopold Robert's first\r\npicture, and his masterpiece, L'IMPROVISATEUR, which used to hang in\r\nthe billiard-room at Neuilly. Either a salvage man, or a looter of\r\nenlightened taste, cut it out with a penknife, in the midst of the\r\nconflagration, and it is the only thing that was saved.\r\n\r\nBut let me come back to my story.\r\n\r\nIn my father's sitting-room at Neuilly, and the billiard-room more\r\nespecially, with the doors on the terrace open, the evenings used to be\r\nspent, in a circle of neighbours, friends, and habitual visitors.\r\n\r\nThese evenings had such a decisive influence on my future destiny that\r\nI cannot do otherwise than speak of them.\r\n\r\nThat billiard-room is before me now, with the pictures that adorned it,\r\nall of them masterpieces--L'Improvisateur, by Leopold Robert; La Feeme\r\ndu Brigand, by Schnetz, Faust and Marguerite, by Ary Scheffer; Venice,\r\nby Ziegler--hanging round.\r\n\r\nI see the most frequent guests too. First two abbes, whose names--the\r\nAbbe de Saint-Phar and the Abbe de Saint-Albin--were a significant\r\ninheritance due to the frailty of their great-grandparents many years\r\nbefore the Revolution And yet another abbe, with powdered side curls,\r\nL'Abbe de Labordere, a former Grand Vicar of Frejus' who somehow or\r\nother, I know not how, had become mayor of Neuilly. Then there was the\r\nMarechal de Gouvion de Saint-Cyr, our near neighbour, who always had a\r\ncircle round him; and admirals too, the Comte de Sercey, with his\r\npigtail--an Indian veteran, Admiral Villaumetz; and generals and\r\nofficers besides, whose stories of their campaigns used to fill us with\r\nenthusiasm. Amongst the generals who were friends of the family there\r\nwas General Drouot, who was very fond of me, and would take me on his\r\nknee and tell me stories. I had seen Horace Vernet's picture, La\r\nBataille de Hanau, which represents Drouot on foot amongst his guns,\r\njust as the Bavarian Cuirassiers are charging through them. That had\r\nbeen quite enough to fire my ardour, and I wanted to be an artilleryman\r\ntoo. Just about the same time, my father was presented with a\r\ntwelve-pounder howitzer by the Vincennes artillery, and Colonel de\r\nCaraman came to try it with us. We fired shots in the park, at the\r\nrising ground near Villiers, and my military enthusiasm was wrought up\r\nto the highest pitch. I tormented my mother till she had an artillery\r\nuniform made for me, and when I had it on my back I thought my fortune\r\nwas made. After having been taken to the fair at Neuilly, and seeing\r\nthe non-commissioned officers of the Regiment of the Guard quartered at\r\nCourbevoie dancing with the pretty laundresses belonging to the\r\nvillage, I tried hard to force my sisters to join me in imitating the\r\nparticular style of dance I had seen them perform. I have heard it said\r\nthat my choregraphic performance was fairly successful, but there my\r\nfancy for the military career ended. General Drouot went back to Nancy;\r\nI did not see him again, and I soon fell under other and more lasting\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\nAmong my father's aides-de-camp there was a young cavalry\r\nlieutenant-colonel, the Comte d'Houdetot, who had begun life as a\r\nmidshipman. He was a very clever man, and one of the most delightful\r\nstory-tellers imaginable. By birth a creole, from the Mauritius, he and\r\nhis family had happened to come back to Europe on board the corvette La\r\nRegeneree, commanded by that same Admiral Villaumetz, our neighbour and\r\nconstant visitor in the billiard-room. At the time of the voyage\r\nD'Houdetot was a baby in arms, and in an action between the Regeneree\r\nand the English, at the Loos Islands, his wet nurse was cut in two by a\r\nround shot, which gave rise to a saying of his, \"I have more right to\r\npromotion than anybody. Lots of people have had horses killed under\r\nthem, but I'm the only man in the French army that ever had a woman\r\nkilled under him.\"\r\n\r\nMutually attracted by this common memory, the former middy and the old\r\nadmiral used to spend their evenings relating their adventures to each\r\nother and their stories, which had begun by interesting, ended by\r\nfascinating me. It was worth while to hear D'Houdetot tell about the\r\nbattle of Trafalgar, at which he had been present as a midshipman on\r\nboard the Algesiras, commanded by his uncle Admiral Magon, how, as he\r\nlay on the poop, with both his legs broken by the bursting of a shell,\r\nhe saw his uncle the admiral receive his death-blow, at the very moment\r\nwhen, wounded already, and his hat and wig carried away by a shot, he\r\nhad thrown himself on to the nettings, shouting to his crew, \"The first\r\nman who boards that ship with me shall have the Cross;\" and how too,\r\nthe boarding party having been driven back, the mizzen-mast of the\r\nAlgesiras, cut through by a round shot, fell across the British ship,\r\nthrowing a comrade of D'Houdetot's, the midshipman of the maintop,\r\nbeyond it, into the sea, and how that middy swam back to the Algesiras.\r\nAnd then came the story of the tempest after the battle, in which\r\nvictors and vanquished alike struggled together to escape shipwreck,\r\nunder the command of Lieutenant de la Bretonniere, in later days my own\r\ncommanding officer, who succeeded in bringing the ship into Cadiz.\r\nThere D'Houdetot was lying upon the mole, under a burning sun, feverish\r\nand exhausted with pain, when the hand of a woman, whom his youth had\r\ntouched, spread a fan over \"the poor little fellow's\" head, to protect\r\nhim from the blaze. He drew the ministering hand to him, and kissed it,\r\nand to that simple act he owed his escape from the horrors of an\r\novercrowded hospital, teeming with typhus. He recovered, re-embarked on\r\nboard the frigate Hermione, and was wrecked with her. \"Trafalgar and a\r\nshipwreck in the space of two years,\" he used to say, \"gave me enough\r\nof a seafaring life.\" He got leave to be transferred to the cavalry,\r\nand covered himself with glory in the heroic charges at the battle of\r\nthe Moskowa; but his heart always remained with his old sailor\r\ncomrades, and he never tired of talking about them.\r\n\r\nAs for old Villaumetz, his whole life had been spent on board ship. He\r\nhad gone with M. d'Entrecasteaux to search for La Peyrouse; he had\r\ncommanded the squadron from which Prince Jerome Bonaparte deserted with\r\nhis ship the Veteran, and his stories of sea fights and adventures were\r\nendless. Listening to them first inspired me with that longing to enter\r\nthe naval career which never left me again.\r\n\r\nMy first attempts at seafaring were made at Treport, during the short\r\nholiday trips we used to take to the Chateau d'Eu. I was dreadfully\r\nsea-sick every time, but that did not dismay me; and then the honest\r\nsailors, with their simple, open, resolute faces, attracted me\r\nirresistibly I used to envy them their risky life, as I watched their\r\nboats from the jetty at Treport, running in before the gale. That\r\nsettled the matter; I was regularly fascinated, in short. And that love\r\nof my life will last as long as I do. Besides the sailoring charm which\r\nTreport had for me, many a pleasant memory of my life is bound up with\r\nEu and Randan. My parents were accustomed in holiday times to take us\r\nfor a little trip either to Eu or to Randan, a large property in the\r\nAuvergne belonging to my aunt. During these journeys, lessons and\r\nschool hours and study of every kind were intermitted, and this alone\r\nsufficed to give them a sovereign charm. It should be added that in\r\nthose days travelling was not what it is now, and that these trips gave\r\nrise to many little adventures, for which we were always on the look\r\nout. My father had had a big carriage built with room for twelve people\r\nin it, which held the whole family, and which, with all due deference,\r\nwas very like a travelling menagerie-van. A courier used to ride on\r\nahead to order post horses; another rode just in front of the carriage.\r\nWhen each stage was finished, the six horses that were to draw us for\r\nthe next were led up: wicked, cross-grained stallions they were, that\r\nsquealed and bit and kicked. They got harnessed somehow or other; and\r\nthen out came the dapper postilions, with their hats trimmed with gay\r\nribbons, cocked on one side, some of them still wearing powder and with\r\ntheir hair tied in a club. They had waistcoats trimmed with dozens of\r\nsilver buttons, and close-fitting pantaloons covered their legs. Margot\r\nwould bring out the great iron-bound boots, into which they shoved\r\nthose same legs; they were hoisted laboriously on to their horses; the\r\npostmaster shouted, \"Now then, in with your spurs, and let them go!\"\r\nand off we went full tear, bells jingling and whips cracking, to the\r\nadmiration of the women and children of the village gathered round to\r\nsee the show. Once we were off, things calmed down; but the postboys\r\nhad no control whatever over their horses, who knew the road, and did\r\nthe stage, from force of habit, at their own pace. If we came across\r\nother carriages or wagons on the road, it was just a question as to\r\nwhether our team would take us too much out of their way, or not\r\nenough. Such meetings were proclaimed by yells from the postilions. If\r\nthe horses did not go far enough to one side, there would be a terrible\r\ncollision, and a volley of oaths, together with a clashing of lanterns\r\nand a clatter of broken windows. If the horses got too far out of the\r\nway, the carriage would first of all tilt towards the sideway, slope\r\nmore and more, and frequently end by turning over gently into the\r\nditch. Then a clamour would rise from the menagerie, everybody first\r\nfeeling themselves all over, and then laughing, while the great machine\r\nwas being lifted up, preparatory to a fresh start. A little farther on,\r\nit might be, another accident would occur. We would be passing through\r\na village, and, to create a sensation, the postboys would begin\r\ncracking their whips in concert. The horses would get excited, and the\r\npace would increase. It was all very well if the village street was a\r\nstraight one, but if there was an angle in it the horses would take it\r\ntoo short, and there would be a violent collision with the kerbstone at\r\nthe corner. Then all the wheelwrights and all the innkeepers, ever on\r\nthe watch for such mishaps, would hurry up. The repairs would take four\r\nhours perhaps, whereat the GRANDSPARENTS would storm, but we children\r\nwere jubilant. Confusion reigned supreme, and we could write to our\r\nlittle friends, \"We were upset at such and such a place; we broke down\r\nat such another.\" We got lots of copy out of it.\r\n\r\nThere was no great interest about our visits to Randan. We used to\r\nleave the high-road at Aigueperse. Six or eight pairs of oxen were\r\nharnessed to the carriage, and Auvergnats in their costumes and\r\nbroad-brimmed hats (there were still costumes there, in those days),\r\nwith goads in their hands, drove the team, the carriage swinging\r\nbackwards and forwards on the muddy roads, up hill and down dale; it\r\nwas hard work getting there, but we did get there at last. The great\r\nentertainment of the visit was to go and see Madame la Dauphine, who\r\nwent through a cure at Vichy every year.\r\n\r\nIt was far pleasanter to stay at Eu. The old castle of the Guises was a\r\nmere tumbledown barrack at the time I speak of. The passages had waves\r\nin them like the sea. When there was a storm the whole house shook, and\r\nthe smaller children used to feel quite frightened, when, after\r\nlistening to Anatole de Montesquiou's ghost stories, of an evening,\r\nthey had to go through the Guise Gallery, with all its dreadful\r\nportraits which seemed to step out of their frames to the dreary\r\nwhistle of the sea-wind. But all the same we loved the old place. It\r\nwas quite out of the common run. Just as we used to go and see Madame\r\nla Dauphine at Vichy from Randan, we used to go from Eu to see Madame\r\nla Duchesse de Berri, at Dieppe, which she had made her summer\r\nresidence. We accompanied her once to the lighthouse at Ailly under the\r\nescort of her guard of honour, a squadron of Cauchoise women on\r\nhorseback. In illo tempore--those days; all Norman women, and those of\r\nthe Caux district especially, did their errands and their marketing on\r\nhorseback. There were very few vehicles to be seen. The prettiest of\r\nthe peasant girls had been selected; and it was really a pleasure to\r\nsee them prancing, to the number of forty, round the Duchess's\r\ncarriage, with their captain and lieutenant riding at each door, all\r\ndressed alike, in white, in the full Cauchoise costume, chignon and cap\r\nwith lace lappets, each on her pacing hack, which she managed to\r\nperfection. When a halt was made, the squadron dismounted, each girl\r\nholding her horse--a most charming effect it made in the Norman\r\nlandscape. I never heard where the guard was quartered, but I am quite\r\nconvinced there never can have been any difficulty about finding the\r\nnecessary billets. I M de Murat, Prefect of the Lower Seine, was the\r\noriginator of this idea. He was a charming fellow, but so absent, that\r\none morning, when the Duchesse de Berri sent for him, he hastily put\r\non his sword and his smartest uniform, and hurried in his\r\nthree-cornered hat to wait on Madame, without discovering, till he got\r\nthere, that he had forgotten his breeches!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ladies and men on horseback.]\r\n\r\nA great change came into my life in 1828. I was ten years old; my turn\r\nhad come; I was sent to school, and entered the College Henri IV. Ay di\r\nme! as the Spanish lament has it. When I pass by Saint-Etienne du Mont,\r\nand look at the Tower of Clovis, and the great walls of that learned\r\nprison in which I spent three years, the memories that come back to me\r\nare not pleasant--far from it. My life there was mortally tedious, and\r\nI did no good whatsoever. My whole education has been gained by reading\r\n(I was and I have always remained passionately fond of reading), by\r\nobservation, and by listening to those people who know how to hold my\r\nattention. I listened with all my ears and all my heart to the Abbe\r\nDupanloup, when he gave me religious instruction; to Pouillet, when he\r\ntaught us physical science; to the great Arago, when he put a sextant\r\ninto my hands for the first time in my life. Later on, to Michelet,\r\nwhen I attended the course of historical lectures he gave to my sister\r\nClementine; and later yet, to the lessons on law which were given us by\r\nM. Rossi, the minister of Pius IX. But Greek and Latin, and hours spent\r\nover an exercise or a translation with a fat dictionary to keep me\r\ncompany! Oh, mercy on me! From the scholastic point of view I was\r\nsimply a DUNCE, nothing but a dunce. Yet I managed to scramble one\r\nprize--the shabbiest of them all--the second for Latin versions in the\r\nseventh class! I was presented with my reward at the prize\r\ndistribution, to the tune of \"Vive Henri IV.\" Vive ce roi vaillant, ce\r\ndiable a quatre . . .! \"At the same moment I received, from a stout\r\nred-faced gentleman, a wet kiss--much too wet a kiss--which gave me no\r\npleasure whatsoever. I recollect the porter at the college was\r\nnicknamed \"Boit-sans-soif\"; that my greatest joy was to go out by his\r\ndoor, after evening school, and go down the Rue de la Montagne or the\r\nRue des Sept-Voies playing a thousand pranks as I went, and that my\r\ngrief used be keen indeed when I had to go back the next morning. Yet\r\nsome good comrades I had whom I dearly loved, and amongst whom I\r\nimproved in playing various games, and learned the art of both giving\r\nand receiving kicks and cuffs. But, take it all in all, my schooldays\r\nare, as they say in mathematics, \"a minus quantity\" to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n1830-1833\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boy waving flag and shooting a gun.]\r\n\r\nThe Revolution of 1830 broke out during my schooldays. I was twelve\r\nyears old--too young therefore, by far, to estimate its character,\r\npolitical or social, correctly. I only remember that it filled me with\r\nthe deepest astonishment. Never having witnessed any kind of\r\ndisturbance, I had not the faintest notion what a revolution might be\r\nlike. I had always seen the King and the Royal Family treated with a\r\nrespect which, indeed, they have never forfeited, and I was a hundred\r\nmiles from the thought that they could possibly be banished. It is a\r\nfact, nevertheless, that the beginning of 1830 differed from other\r\nyears, and that something seemed to be brewing. Strange remarks were\r\nmade at school, over and over again, even among us little ones; our\r\ntutors, all of them connected with the press, were what was called in\r\nthose days \"dans le mouvement\"--abreast of the times, and they never\r\nstopped talking politics. Where were they not talked, indeed? It was a\r\ndownright disease. The speech of M. de Salvandy, on the occasion of the\r\nfete given by my father at the Palais-Royal in May, that year, in\r\nhonour of the King of Naples, my uncle and godfather, may be called to\r\nmind. \"A real Neapolitan fete indeed, Sire!--for we are dancing on a\r\nvolcano.\"\r\n\r\nAnd a truly Neapolitan fete it was, not only on account of the presence\r\nof the sovereigns of the two Sicilies, and of the ideal beauty of the\r\nnight, but also by reason of the tarantella, a sort of ballet, which\r\nwas danced in the middle of the evening, by Madame la Duchesse de Berri\r\nand thirty of the most beautiful young ladies of the Faubourg\r\nSaint-Germain, in Neapolitan costume, among whom I think _I_ still see,\r\ncompact of grace and elegance, the lovely Denise du Roure, soon to\r\nbecome Comtesse d'Hulst. The tarantella was followed by a polonaise,\r\nled by Comte Rodolphe Appony and the Duchesse de Rauzan, resplendent in\r\nblue and gold. A more sedate dance, this, performed by noble lords and\r\nladies, all in Hungarian costume, and escorted by pages, bearing their\r\nrespective banners. It would have been hard to say which of the ladies\r\ntaking part in these two dances bore off the palm for aristocratic\r\nbeauty. They were worthy representatives of their race.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Family, headed by Charles X., was present at this fete,\r\nwhereat pre-eminence of every kind was gathered together and every\r\nclass represented, and where cordiality seemed universal. After the\r\nentrance of the two sets of dancers in costume, the King went out to\r\nwalk on the terrace which runs along the top of the Galerie d'Orleans.\r\nThe night was so warm and lovely that the ladies were walking about in\r\ntheir low gowns, and the dazzling illuminations made it as bright as\r\nday. The courtyard of the Palais-Royal was closed, but an immense crowd\r\nfilled the gardens, trying to see as much as possible of the gay\r\ndoings. I was running in front of Charles X. as he walked along, and I\r\nsaw his tall form advance to the parapet of the terrace on the garden\r\nside, with that truly royal air he had about him. He waved his hand\r\nseveral times in greeting to the crowd, which at that short distance,\r\nand under that brilliant light, must have recognized him perfectly, not\r\nby his features only, but by his full uniform of Colonel-General of the\r\nGuard, and also by the retinue that followed him. But there was no\r\nshout of \"Vive le Roi!\" nor any hostile one either. The surging crowd\r\nonly seemed to be rather more stirred, and the same uproar rose from it\r\nas one may hear on a firework night, when some fine set-piece is set\r\nalight. One last wave of the hand, with a \"Bonjour, mon peuple!\" which\r\nthe King spoke half in jest and half in earnest, and Charles X.\r\ndeparted. I was never to see him again. Immediately afterwards, or\r\nnearly so, the crowd laid hands on the chairs in the garden, piled them\r\nup on the grass plots where the midday gun stood, and set them on fire.\r\nThe troops had to be called out to clear the garden, and that first\r\nscene of public not, so new to me, filled me with astonishment and rage\r\nas well.\r\n\r\nShortly after this fete came the taking of Algiers--a Proof of the\r\nnational strength, of political courage and foresight--a brilliant\r\nmilitary exploit, performed under the \"drapeau blanc,\" which might well\r\nhave roused the enthusiasm of the nation, tightened the bond between\r\nFrance and her king, and reconciled the people to their ancient flag.\r\nIt did nothing of the kind. The taking of Algiers was received like an\r\nordinary piece of news, and the tricolour flag was regretted as deeply\r\nas ever. For the platform and the press--but especially the press, the\r\nmightiest instrument of destruction of modern times--had done their\r\nwork. The days of the Government of the Restoration were numbered. Not\r\nthat it had been blameworthy. Both at home and abroad it had certainly\r\nbeen the best of all the administrations that had succeeded each other\r\nsince 1789. But it had endeavoured to govern like a patriarch, for the\r\npresent good and the future greatness of France, and to withstand the\r\nassaults of those unprincipled individuals who looked on their country\r\nsimply as a farm to make money out of. So bit by bit it had been\r\ndemolished, just as everything has been demolished these past hundred\r\nyears, in the name of laws and principles which dissolve every kind of\r\ngovernment, and which will soon make it absolutely impossible for\r\nsociety to exist. The hour when the words, \"Get out of that, and let me\r\ntake your place,\" the real and only object of our successive\r\nrevolutions, should resound, was on the very stroke.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of July we had all been dining at Saint-Leu with M. le Duc\r\nde Bourbon, an old cousin of ours, who never meddled with politics, and\r\nled a leisured and delightful life between Chantilly and Saint-Leu,\r\nnever coming to Paris except to pass through it, although the beautiful\r\npalace there which bears his name, the Palais Bourbon, belonged to him.\r\nHis great passion was for sport, in which he excelled; and my father\r\nhad made a friend of him by giving him the hunting in all his forests.\r\nThere was another reason too, and perhaps after all it was the chief\r\none, for this cordiality, that my parents had consented to receive the\r\nBaronne de Feucheres, who held great sway over the Duke, but who had\r\nnever been admitted to Court. I can see the handsome old man yet,\r\nlaconic in speech, his profile of the most strongly marked Bourbon\r\ntype, his hair and pigtail white, with his tightly buttoned blue coat,\r\nfrom which a lace frill escaped, and his trousers, which were always\r\nmuch too short, showing his white stockings underneath. On the evening\r\nI speak of there had been a great gathering at Saint-Leu--a big dinner,\r\nthen a drawing-room play, acted by Madame de Feucheres and the Duke's\r\ngentlemen. In the audience were many officers of the Royal Guard, and\r\nnumerous other persons, whose names were known to me from having heard\r\nthem quoted as being amongst those ardent Conservatives called at that\r\ntime the \"Ultras.\" One of them, a M. de Vitrolles, attracted my\r\nattention by holding a long conversation with my father in one of the\r\nintervals between the acts. He has since related this conversation in\r\nhis Memoirs, and also the conviction it gave him of the horror with\r\nwhich the idea of a fresh revolution filled my father. Their only\r\ndisagreement was as to the means to avert it. Which of the two was in\r\nthe right?\r\n\r\nThat evening we went back to Neuilly, and the next morning, 26th of\r\nJuly, as we were just getting ready, Nemours and I, to start for\r\nschool, somebody opened the door and launched the remark to our tutors:\r\n\"The coup d'Etat is in the Moniteur!\" \"What!\" \"Yes! The Decrees.\"\r\nWhereupon the tutors rushed to the family drawing-room, whither we\r\nfollowed them. There sat my father, thunderstruck, the Moniteur in his\r\nhand. When he saw the tutors come in, he threw up his arms in despair,\r\nand let them fall again. After a silence on his Part, during which my\r\nmother rapidly acquainted the gentlemen with the state of affairs, my\r\nfather said: \"They are mad!\" That was all, and after another silence, a\r\nlong one--\"They will get themselves banished again. Oh! for my part, I\r\nhave been exiled twice already. I will not bear it again: I stay in\r\nFrance!\"\r\n\r\nI heard no more, for it was schooltime, and we had to get into the\r\ncarriage; but those words and that first impression remain graven on my\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nThat day at school was just like any other, but the next, the 27th, as\r\nwe came back from the College Henri IV, it was easy to see that there\r\nwas a great stir in Paris Deligny's swimming school, at the corner of\r\nthe Quai d'Orsay, where we went after school, according to custom, to\r\ntake our bath, was full of young men discussing and holding forth, and\r\nrelating incidents, true or not, which had occurred during the day. The\r\nPlace Louis XV., now the Place de la Concorde, was occupied by the\r\ntroops. There was a regiment of Foot Guards, a battalion of the Swiss\r\nGuard, the Lancers of the Guard, the Artillery of the Military\r\nSchool--magnificent troops all of them, the finest I have seen in any\r\ncountry, and of which the English Foot Guards alone in these days give\r\nany idea. Officers inspired in the highest possible degree with esprit\r\nde corps and chivalrous devotion, old non-commissioned officers, many\r\nof whom had seen the wars of the Empire, commanding seasoned soldiers,\r\nyoung in years but old in discipline and instruction, and all proud of\r\nthe splendid uniform they wore--such was the Royal Guard. And what\r\nshall I say of the superb Swiss battalions, acknowledged by ancient\r\ntradition to be the finest infantry in the world? These splendid\r\ntroops, which might have rendered such great service to France on the\r\nbattlefield were to disappear within two days. Upon them too I had\r\nlooked my last. Close to the Porte Maillot we met the Duchesse de\r\nBerri, riding amongst a numerous group of equerries. We exchanged\r\nfriendly greetings. No doubt her instinct as a woman and a mother led\r\nher to try to keep in touch with passing events.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, the 28th, we knew Paris to be in open revolt. Cannon\r\nboomed, the great bell of Notre-Dame sounded the tocsin, and naturally\r\nwe did not go to school. But the masters who gave my sisters lessons\r\ncame out to Neuilly, and from them, in turn, we learnt what was going\r\non within the capital--barricades in all the streets--the troops on the\r\ndefensive--the tricolour hoisted everywhere.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th, the struggle grew closer to us. A bullet fell whistling in\r\nthe park. According to the fugitives from Paris, the insurrection had\r\ntriumphed, the troops of the line were fraternizing with the rebels,\r\nand the Guard was retiring on Saint-Cloud to gather round the King. I\r\npass over all the rumours and false reports accompanying this news,\r\nwhich was all too true. And what were we doing during these anxious\r\nhours? We obeyed various impulses. The first, a fervent sympathy with\r\nour soldiers, who were engaged in the struggle--ces pauvres soldats,\r\nthe real France, the real PEOPLE, obeying the noblest\r\nmotives--honour--duty opposing the POPULACE, whose envy and evil\r\ninstincts had been let loose by a handful of ambitious men. And we knew\r\nno rest till the whole staff of the household had repaired to the\r\nvarious gates of the park, to open them to the soldiers, separated,\r\ndispersed, threatened with massacre as they were. They were brought in\r\nand fed, and given caps and blouses instead of their uniforms, and put\r\nacross to the other side of the Seine in boats. And with all that, so\r\nfull is the heart of man, and yet more that of the child, of\r\ncontradiction, that we followed the current and made tricolour\r\ncockades, my sisters and I, and all of us! There is no doubt the\r\nfascination of the tricolour flag had a good deal to do with the\r\nrapidity with which the Revolutionary powder-train took fire.\r\n\r\nAs there must always be a laughable side, even to the grimmest events,\r\nthe comic element was supplied in this case by our professors of\r\nlanguages, drawing, and so forth, who had not dared to go back into\r\nParis after leaving it on the 28th, on account of the fighting. When\r\nthey had made up their minds to return on the 29th, we persuaded those\r\nof them who wore moustaches that they would run very great risks, and\r\neven be taken for soldiers in disguise. Whereupon the schoolroom was at\r\nonce turned into a barber's shop, where a general shaving was\r\nperformed, with the inevitable change of appearance resulting\r\nthere-from, which increased the alarm of the individuals operated upon\r\ntenfold.\r\n\r\nWhile our professors were shaving off their moustaches, our father was\r\ndisappearing from Neuilly. His movements were rigorously concealed from\r\nus, and I never learnt what they really were even in later days. So I\r\nwill not attempt to speak of them. We were soon aware of the bare fact\r\nthat he was in Paris, exercising public functions which were somewhat\r\nill-defined as yet; and on the evening of the 31st my mother informed\r\nus that we were going to join him at the Palais-Royal. [Footnote: It is\r\nnot for me to pass judgment on my father's conduct in accepting the\r\ncrown in 1830. There is no doubt the July Revolution was a great\r\nmisfortune. It gave a fresh blow to the monarchical principle, and it\r\nunfortunately encouraged those who speculate in insurrection. But I\r\nknow as a fact that my father never desired it, and indeed watched its\r\napproach with the deepest sorrow. When the throne of Charles X.\r\ncollapsed without his being able to defend it in any way, he certainly\r\nfelt the most passionate desire to escape the common exile and to\r\ncontinue living a life which was to him the happiest of lives in\r\nFrance. The struggle one over, and the country in revolt from end to\r\nend, he realized that the only way in which he could escape exile was\r\nto associate himself with the movement, and at the outset he certainly\r\ndid it solely in the hope of bringing back Henri V. to the throne. When\r\nthis hope failed him, he yielded to the entreaties of those persons who\r\nimplored him as the only person in a position to do it, to check France\r\non that fateful descent which must bring her from the Republic to a\r\nDictatorship, and so on to invasion, and to mutilation. He delayed that\r\ndisastrous succession of events for eighteen years, at the risk of his\r\nown life, which was incessantly threatened, and history will do him\r\nhonour for it in spite of the injustice of human nature.]\r\n\r\nWe started about eight o'clock at night, my mother, my aunt Adelaide,\r\nand we children, in an omnibus, so as not to attract notice. We began\r\nto come to barricades at the Barriere de l'Etoile, but openings had\r\nbeen made in them already, large enough for carriages to pass through,\r\nall which openings were watched by guards of armed people--I beg their\r\npardons, I was mistaken--armed CITIZENS, playing at soldiers and\r\npolice, who stopped and cross-questioned everybody in the most childish\r\nfashion. The omnibus could not get beyond the Place Louis XV., so many\r\nobstacles did we find in the way. We got out, and my mother divided us\r\ninto twos, and told us to scatter and meet again at the Palais-Royal.\r\n\r\nParis was a curious sight that night, lighted up everywhere with lamps,\r\nand tricolour flags at every window. How people found time to make up\r\nso many emblems in those two days is a mystery! The streets were all\r\ntorn up, and the paving-stones piled into the barricades, mixed up with\r\noverturned carriages, casks, and rubbish of all kinds. Behind these\r\nbarriers were extemporized guardians, passers-by, people walking about\r\nwith guns and firing them off every minute, and everybody, man, woman,\r\nand child, wore huge tricolour cockades in hats and caps or bonnets, or\r\nin their hair.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of a great crowd on the Place du Palais-Royal there was\r\none of the Laffitte et Caillard diligences, which had been used as a\r\nbarricade, and set up again. It was full of people inside, and they\r\nclustered on the roof like bees, all of them singing in chorus. Between\r\nthe choruses, sharp volleys of musketry rang out, and the vehicle,\r\ndrawn by three or four hundred people holding on to ropes, tore round\r\nthe square, amid a concert of varied yells. Though it was very late\r\nwhen we reached the palace, it was all lighted up, and every door stood\r\nopen. Anybody who chose could go in, and when we went up the stairs we\r\nfound many people already settled on the steps, prepared to spend the\r\nnight there. We saw my father in his study, and then we were sent to\r\nbed, or rather to camp out in the rooms we usually slept in. The next\r\nday the firing slackened, but the general idleness continued; everybody\r\nwas walking about. Soon the question of food began to press, for all\r\nsupplies and trade were stopped by the universal barricades. Everybody\r\nasked everybody else what was going on, a subject upon which every one\r\nexcept the leaders was profoundly ignorant. The multitude was just like\r\nan immense flock of sheep, whose shepherds had been driven away, and\r\nwho seemed to wonder why the new dogs who were to herd them did not\r\nmake their appearance. There was no bad feeling; now and then there\r\nwould be a panic, everybody taking to their heels, nobody knew why, and\r\nthen stopping again and bursting out laughing. Sometimes a noise arose,\r\nand swelled as it drew nearer. It was some popular leader going to the\r\nHotel de Ville or the Palais-Royal, with two or three claqueurs before\r\nhim, to stir up an enthusiasm in which everybody shared, without having\r\na notion of the name of the hero they were acclaiming, yet glad to be\r\nable thus to show off their civic rights. Then there would be a fit of\r\ngeneral tenderness. Everybody kissed everybody else vehemently. In some\r\ncases a transport of patriotism thus calmed itself; in others perhaps\r\nit was the effect of the extreme heat, and the consequent thirst, which\r\nhad not gone unquenched, and in others, again, it was merely the\r\nrelaxation of morals an era of universal brotherhood brought with it.\r\nThe hero of this general and infectious kissing match was Lafayette.\r\nEverybody wanted to kiss him. A great rattle of drums having announced\r\nhis arrival at the Palais-Royal one day, he had to take his stand in\r\none of the drawing-rooms, in front of me, and be kissed by thousands of\r\npersons of all ages. I did it, like all the others, but I saw people I\r\nknew come up again many times over to be kissed by the illustrious\r\nveteran, and each time their agitation seemed to increase.\r\n\r\nEvery one went in and out of the Palais-Royal as they chose. It was a\r\nstrange march past, of people of all sorts, who came to take notes, see\r\nhow the wind blew, and give in an adhesion which might be more or less\r\ndisinterested. Some of them, inspired by real devotion, came to try if\r\nthey might even yet serve a cause that was so dear to them. Thus I saw\r\nM. de Chateaubriand led into my mother's drawing-room by Anatole de\r\nMontesquiou. And, on the other hand, I saw Savary, Duc de Rovigo,\r\nnotorious in connection with the Duc d'Enghien, in full uniform, booted\r\nand spurred, leave the study, whither he had gone to offer my father\r\nhis services.\r\n\r\nOne evening, as we were all gathered together, we heard a great noise\r\ncoming from the staircase. We hurried towards it. A crowd of armed men,\r\nwith lighted torches, were coming up, shouting loudly and waving flags.\r\nAt their head came five or six pupils of the Ecole Polytechnique, with\r\ntheir three-cornered hats cocked and swords drawn. Behind them a woman\r\nin man's attire, red belt and close-fitting pantaloons, was being borne\r\nin triumph. She was a heroine of the barricades, whom the yelling crowd\r\ndesired to introduce to my father, and he had to receive her. This\r\nscene filled me with disgust, and it was soon followed by another, no\r\nless painful. The leaders of the Revolution had sent an army of\r\nvolunteers to dislodge the old King and his Guard from Rambouillet.\r\nThey did not turn him out, first of all because the King himself had\r\ndecided to disband his guard and retire to Cherbourg with no escort but\r\nfour companies of his bodyguard; and, secondly, because these same\r\nvolunteers, numerous as they were on leaving Paris, melted away rapidly\r\non the road, and above all things took good care not to venture within\r\nrange of the Guard's fire. Nevertheless, they returned in triumph from\r\nRambouillet, bringing back the royal horses and carriages, which they\r\nhad seized without striking a blow. I was horrified to see the great\r\ncarriages, with six or eight horses, still driven by the wretched\r\ncoachmen and postilions, in their state liveries, enter the Place du\r\nPalais-Royal--believing as I did that they were bringing back the King\r\nand his family as prisoners, into the very jaws of the Revolution. But,\r\nhappily, this was not the case. The only people in the carriages were\r\nsome young blackguards, dressed up in extraordinary garments,\r\ndressing-gowns and cotton caps, and I know not what other masquerading\r\ntrash, intended to call forth the ribald jokes of the multitude. It was\r\na disgusting scene. The days passed on, and by degrees Paris returned\r\nto its ordinary life. The streets were repaired, vehicles began to\r\ncirculate again. Soldiers, gendarmes, policemen, were to be seen once\r\nmore, and a certain sense of security revived. At all events the\r\neternal struggle of order against disorder began afresh. Those who\r\nformed the most turbulent element of the Revolutionary party were\r\ninduced, by degrees, to engage in the army, and were drafted off to\r\nAlgiers, under the title of \"Regiments de la Charte.\" It was less easy\r\nto get rid of a Guard of Honour, numbering some two or three hundred\r\nmen, which had formed itself on its own responsibility, nominally for\r\nthe protection of my father and of the Palais-Royal. This guard was\r\nalways in the vestibule and on the staircase, night and day alike. It\r\nwas an omnium gatherum of vagabonds, prowling ruffians of the vilest\r\nkind, ragged scamps, all carrying arms, stolen from every sort of\r\nplace, among others from the Musee d'Artillerie, whence some had gone\r\nso far as to borrow cuirasses and helmets that had belonged to the\r\nwarriors of the League. Of course they all had to be fed and paid. The\r\nchief of the band was a midshipman in the navy, on leave in Paris at\r\nthe time the Revolution broke out, of the name of Damiguet de Vernon,\r\nwho died afterwards with the rank of general in the army. Whenever my\r\nfather went out, to go to the Chamber of Deputies or elsewhere, this\r\nrabble turned out and saluted after a fashion of its own, with drums\r\nbeating and trumpets blowing. It was a scene quite worthy of Callot's\r\npencil. To get rid of this worthy set, the midshipman was at once given\r\na lieutenant's commission in the mounted Municipal Guard, under pretext\r\nof a reward from the nation, and clothes were bestowed on his band,\r\nwherewith they hastened to decamp on the first sign of the introduction\r\nof anything like discipline into their ranks.\r\n\r\nOur regular routine began again too. After over a week's holiday, I was\r\nput back to school, where we immediately made a revolution of our own,\r\nby insisting that the bell which rang for class and mealtimes should be\r\nreplaced by a drum. If, as I went into school with my folding desk\r\nunder my arm, I came across the column of big boys coming down from\r\ntheir class-rooms, I used to get many a cuff to the tune of \"Take that,\r\nyour young Majesty!\" or the slang saying of the day, \"Have you seen\r\nLeontine?\"--this last from the name of Leontine Fay, a favourite\r\nactress with young people. But, apart from that, my life was as\r\nmonotonous as ever it had been. The riots and attempts at insurrection\r\nwhich succeeded each other with something very like regularity seemed\r\nto diversify it but very little. Yet I did feel a certain excitement\r\nthe first time I witnessed one of these attempts at sedition. Our\r\nevening was just over at the Palais-Royal, and I had gone up to my\r\nroom, when loud shouts, and an ejaculation of \"Oh, good gracious!\" from\r\nmy valet, made me run to the window. The Court of the Palais-Royal was\r\nclosed, but all the galleries were filled with a surging, yelling\r\ncrowd, the more violent of whom were battering at the staircase door\r\nfacing Chevet's shop. \"They are going to break it in and come upstairs:\r\nthey'll be here in another moment,\" we said to ourselves. \"What is to\r\nbe done?\"\r\n\r\nAmidst the general shouting, yells of \"Death to Louis Philippe!\" were\r\nto be heard. Then, all at once, in the gaslight, I saw the policemen's\r\nswords twinkle, pinking people in all directions. Soon the troops came\r\nhurrying up with fixed bayonets, and the rabble took to their heels at\r\nthe sight of them. This crowd had just come back from Vincennes,\r\nwhither it had gone to demand the heads of Charles X.'s ministers, who\r\nwere shut up in the fortress, from General Daumesnil, \"the man with the\r\nwooden leg,\" and having failed in that attempt it wanted to have my\r\nfather's instead.\r\n\r\nSo that affair ended; but fresh opportunities for creating disturbances\r\nsoon occurred, and were as eagerly seized upon. One was during a great\r\ndiplomatic dinner given by my father in the dining-room of the\r\nPalais-Royal, which looks out on the Cour des Fontaines. I was sitting\r\nby Lord Granville's daughter, and doing my best to make myself\r\npleasant, when the uproar of the riot burst upon us suddenly and\r\ninterrupted all the talk. Everybody looked at everybody else, and then\r\ndown at their own plate, and everybody looked very sorry to be where he\r\nwas at that moment. Then the noise of a great trampling of hoofs on the\r\npavement revealed the fact that the cavalry was charging, whereupon the\r\nsky cleared, and conversation began again, though not without some\r\nappearance of effort.\r\n\r\nAnother time, again, matters became more serious. The riot--I don't\r\nremember which it was now, there were so many of them!--became very\r\nthreatening at one moment. I see my father still, taking Casimir Perier\r\nby the arm, and shouting in his ear, \"Tell them to serve out ball\r\ncartridge, ball cartridge, do you hear?\" Casimir Perier, as excited as\r\nhimself, was rushing away, when he was stopped by an officer, who said,\r\n\"There are three students of the Ecole Polytechnique, sent to parley,\r\nwaiting below.\"\r\n\r\n\"Parley for whom? For the rioters? For the insurrection? Lay hands on\r\nthem! Lock them up in prison.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, sir,\" said the officer, himself a former student at the Ecole\r\nPolytechnique, \"I can't: I've given them my word!\" But Casimir Perier\r\nwas not there to listen even just then I observed a man of woebegone\r\nappearance, sitting in a corner of the drawing-room in which the\r\nforegoing scene had taken place. One of my eldest brother's\r\naides-de-camp, General Marbot, was walking up and down in front of him,\r\nnever taking his eyes off him. \"What are you doing there?\" I asked the\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n\"I'm keeping my eye on that gentleman you see there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Prefect of Police.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?\"\r\n\r\n\"They say he is playing us false\"\r\n\r\nAnd there you see a specimen of the plight you find yourself in on the\r\nmorrow of a revolution, when order needs restoring not only in the open\r\nstreets but in the highest quarters in the State.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I was always delighted to hear the drums call the\r\nNational Guard--and consequently all our masters, tutors, and\r\nprofessors, who served in it--to arms, at each fresh outbreak of\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\nIt meant interrupted studies, and, above all, interrupted attendance at\r\nschool, where, however, luckily for me, I was not to stay much longer.\r\nSeeing that I did no good there whatever, my father decided, in the\r\nspring of 1831, to remove me altogether, and as my taste for a naval\r\ncareer was growing stronger and stronger, he resolved to make a sailor\r\nof me But before I seriously entered the profession he wished me to\r\nmake a sea-voyage. So I was sent to Toulon, to be shipped as volunteer\r\npilot's apprentice, on board the Arthemise frigate, commander Latreyte.\r\nI was barely thirteen I could not have begun at a better age.\r\n\r\nAfter bidding the tenderest farewell to my father and mother, my aunt,\r\nand my brothers and sisters, from whom I had never been parted before,\r\nI was packed into a post-chaise with Monsieur Trognon, and off we\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\nAs far as Lyons our journey was uneventful, but when we got there M.\r\nPaulze d'Ivoy, the prefet, and M. Vitet, author of Barricades des Etats\r\nde Blois, took possession of me, nominally to show me the town--in\r\nreality to make me the pretext for certain demonstrations in favour of\r\nthe new order of things. I was driven about, to Fourvieres, to La\r\nCroix-Rousse, and so forth, and had the best of receptions from their\r\nsturdy inhabitants. Thirteen-year-old lad as I was, I had to receive\r\nthe officers of the National Guard--very military indeed they were,\r\nwith their uniform with its white facings, copied from that of the\r\nImperial Guard. And these receptions and official entertainments, which\r\nwere not at all to my personal taste, were repeated all along the road\r\ntill we got to Toulon, marked by increasing animation and fervour as we\r\ngot farther south, and as the population through which we passed became\r\nmore and more divided by political passions. At Valence I found an\r\nenormous crowd of people, and the garrison and National Guard both\r\nunder arms, while a tall lieutenant-colonel, of the 49th Regiment of\r\nthe Line, insisted on my inspecting the troops in person.\r\n\r\nHe took my hand with one of his, with the other he waved his sword, and\r\nled the plaudits. His name was Magnan, and he was a Marshal of France\r\nbefore he died. At Mornas, the native place of the famous Baron des\r\nAdrets, the reception took a very original shape. As we drove up to the\r\nposting-house, I saw a great crowd, and the National Guard drawn up in\r\ntwo ranks, on the right and left of the postilions who were to take us\r\non. The carriage pulled up between the ranks, and I fancied I saw a\r\nsort of suppressed smile on the countenances of the National Guard. It\r\ndid not last long, for the commandant in the wildest excitement rapidly\r\ngave the words of command: \"Present arms--Fire!\" And they were followed\r\nby the most abominable noise, every man having presented arms with his\r\nfinger on the trigger of his musket. The crowd cheered tremendously,\r\nthe horses plunged and reared, and there was a terrible disturbance,\r\nwhich seemed to afford the keenest joy to the officer in command. There\r\nwas nothing very striking at Orange, nor at Avignon. Speeches by the\r\nauthorities, visits to the public buildings, very much the same routine\r\nas that which official receptions have nowadays made so familiar to\r\neverybody. But at Orgon, between Avignon and Aix, it was a very\r\ndifferent matter. An immense and excited crowd awaited our arrival,\r\nshouting all manner of things. Then the carriage was seized upon by\r\npeople who looked drunk, but who were drunk with political passion\r\nalone. It seems the town of Orgon was not reckoned to favour the regime\r\nof 1830. So from every side I was greeted with shouts of \"We are\r\nCavaillon's men! ... We've come down from the mountains so that you may\r\ntell your papa there are no Carlists in Provence.\" And then they sang\r\nthe Marseillaise The horses were taken out of the carriage, the crowd\r\nsurrounded it, climbing on the steps, the wheels, the fore-carriage,\r\nthe roof. I was like a prisoner in a cage; all I could see out of the\r\nwindow was the boots of the people who were sitting on the top. They\r\nsang all the verses of the Marseillaise, and bawled between them. A\r\ngentleman contrived to slip up to the carriage door, gave himself out\r\nto be the mayor, and tried to rescue us, calling out: \"Gentlemen, this\r\nreally is not decent behaviour.\" All he got for his pains was a shout\r\nof \"What the devil do we care about a mayor like you?\" I don't know how\r\nlong it would have gone on, if a detachment of the battalion of\r\nGovernment workmen quartered at Orgon, which had been sent for, had not\r\ncome to our rescue.\r\n\r\nBetween Orgon and Marseilles we met the \"Regiment de la Charte\"\r\nmarching from Paris on their way to Algiers, and their passage through\r\nthe country did not a little to excite the inhabitants. At Marseilles\r\nthe National Guard lined the Allees de Meillan, each man with a bouquet\r\nstuck into the muzzle of his rifle, which he took out and threw into\r\nthe barouche in which I sat with General Gazan, so that I was soon\r\nfairly buried, with nothing but my head sticking out, while the crowd\r\nshouted at the top of its voice: \"Vive le Prinnche!--Long live the\r\nPrince!\" and I heard women's voices adding, \"Que sis poulid! Qui est si\r\njoli!\"\r\n\r\nI had hardly reached Toulon, ere the frigate I had joined put to sea,\r\nmy apprenticeship began, and I soon made myself at home among our\r\nsailors, who all of them, officers, petty officers, and seamen alike,\r\nnot only showed me an affection which won my heart from the very\r\noutset, but took every pains to make my stay amongst them a pleasant\r\none, while each in his own special sphere initiated me into all the\r\ndetails of my duty.\r\n\r\nThe Arthemise was a fine sailing frigate, of fifty-two guns, with huge\r\nspars--one of the most elegant types of the old-fashioned ships, but an\r\nold-fashioned ship she was indeed. We even had hempen cables instead of\r\nchain ones! The crew, drawn almost exclusively from the lists of\r\nregistered seamen, was active and bold on the rigging, but somewhat\r\ninsubordinate. The words of command were given amidst volleys of oaths,\r\nand carried out under a hail of blows dealt by the petty officers. The\r\nsuperior officers, who had all belonged to the old Imperial Navy, clung\r\nto that detestable habit, which has cost us so many reverses, of\r\ncompletely neglecting the military side of the ship's drill. The only\r\nthing they looked to was navigation. There was indeed a routine of\r\nregulation practice carried out, but it was utterly ridiculous. The ne\r\nplus ultra of perfection in artillery drill, for instance, was supposed\r\nto be when at the word \"Ram\" all the thirteen rammers of the ship's\r\nbattery struck the bore of the guns with irreproachable simultaneity!\r\nNow and then there was a rehearsal of the drill book, but it was always\r\ndone amidst universal sleepiness and inattention. There never was one\r\nday's practice, nor even one shot fired, during the whole cruise.\r\n\r\nThe commander gave me boatswains and sailors to teach me the various\r\ndetails of my duty, and I soon learnt to give things their right names,\r\nto tie knots, and to climb about the rigging too, though I did not\r\nmanage that, the first time, without being horribly frightened. I\r\nremember, when I got as far as the topgallant crosstrees, clinging on,\r\nand not daring to come down till I was driven to it by the jeers of the\r\non-lookers. But I learnt most of all by observation, and from the\r\noutset I had that indescribable thing that nobody can teach another,\r\nthe seafaring instinct. Our cruise was a pleasant one, and our stays in\r\nport were interesting. At Ajaccio I came upon more public functions,\r\nand was the hero of a Bonapartist demonstration. I was borne as though\r\nin triumph to the house where Napoleon was born, where I was received\r\nby a very old Signor Ramolino, brother to Madame Letitia. In common\r\nwith my sisters, who drew pictures of Napoleon all over the place, I\r\nprofessed the greatest admiration for the great warrior. So I asked his\r\nuncle for some souvenir of him, and he presented me with a red\r\narmchair, out of the room in which he was born.\r\n\r\nAfter a visit to the Dey of Algiers, the last representative of those\r\nBarbary Moors who were the \"Terror of the Seas,\" as the Muette de\r\nPortici has it, I received at Leghorn an invitation from the Grand Duke\r\nof Tuscany to come to Florence, and was taken thither by the French\r\nMinister, M. de Ganay, a charming man. There was nothing that excellent\r\ngood Grand Duke and his family did not do for me while I staid at the\r\nPitti Palace, and the only acknowledgment I could make of it all was to\r\nturn my schoolboy talents to constructing a jointed jumping jack, that\r\nturned head over heels, for one of the young princesses whom we used to\r\ncall the Archduchess Mimi, and who afterwards married Prince Luitpold\r\nof Bavaria. I returned on board the Arthemise full of gratitude for my\r\nreception, and of admiration for the monuments and artistic marvels I\r\nhad seen at Florence and Pisa and Pistoja, and in which, in spite of my\r\nyouth, I had taken the deepest interest.\r\n\r\nAt Naples I found fresh delights in the midst of my mother's family and\r\nmy young cousins, of both sexes, one of whom, Antonietta, an admirably\r\nbeautiful girl, later became Grand Duchess of Tuscany in her turn.\r\nNothing indeed could have been more charming than the Naples of those\r\ndays. I do not speak of that wondrous setting which will last to all\r\neternity, but of the Naples of the Neapolitans, gay, noisy, and teeming\r\nwith wit, as it was before the plague of politics fell on it, bringing\r\ndivisions and gloom, and despoiling it of all its charm of originality;\r\nNaples, with its lazzaroni and its macaroni, and its \"corricoli\"\r\ntearing along with tinkling bells, crammed with monks and women in\r\ntheir costumes--the Naples, in fine, of Pulcinella and of Leopold\r\nRobert.\r\n\r\nAfter Naples came Palermo, and then Malta, where we found the\r\nmagnificent British squadron, and received the most hospitable of\r\nwelcomes from General and Lady Emily Ponsonby, the governor and his\r\ncharming wife.\r\n\r\nOur stay at Malta ended with a disagreeable incident, hardly\r\nconceivable in these days, when naval discipline may be held up as a\r\nmodel to every one. On the evening of the day before that on which we\r\nwere to weigh anchor, our whole crew deserted in a body. In spite of\r\nthe efforts of the officer of the watch, and some others of inferior\r\nrank, who were present, over 300 men seized the boats and dories that\r\nlay alongside of us, and took \"French leave\" on shore. The next day we\r\ncould not start, for we had no crew. We had to apply to the police and\r\nthe English garrison, who sent out pickets, collected our rovers, and\r\nbrought almost all of them back in the course of the evening, and we\r\nstarted somewhat humiliated at having given the English such a sad\r\nspecimen of the insubordination which always follows on revolutions.\r\nThe English have had their revolution too, but they have taken good\r\ncare to have no more than the one, and above all not to make laws which\r\nrender a periodical recurrence of revolution inevitable. As we had over\r\n300 delinquents, it was impossible to punish them. The men felt this,\r\nand, with the evident intention of setting their officers at defiance,\r\nthey spent the next few evenings singing revolutionary songs, some\r\nverses of which they came and yelled on their knees on the quarterdeck.\r\nThe firmness of the commanding officers got the better of these\r\nsaturnalia, by degrees.\r\n\r\nStorms delayed us in the Maltese waters, and we only just missed being\r\non the spot on the very day when an eruption threw up an island and a\r\nvolcano from the depths of the sea, to which they have now returned.\r\nAfter a long passage, the frigate anchored at Algiers, which in 1831\r\nwas still the city of the Deys. Not a street had been widened, nor a\r\nEuropean house built. It was still inhabited by a numerous native\r\npopulation. The Rue de la Marine, which was like a narrow winding\r\nstaircase, was crowded with negro women street sellers, the cafes\r\nfilled with Moors wearing huge turbans. To increase the picturesqueness\r\nof the situation, there was fighting going on at the city gates.\r\nBerthezene, the Governor-General, had just been forced to beat a\r\nretreat from Medeah. I could see the firing on the slopes of Kouba from\r\nthe frigate, and a column had to be sent out to revictual the\r\nMaison-Carree! Under these circumstances, the Governor bethought\r\nhimself that it would be a good thing to show \"the King's son\" to the\r\ntroops, and settled to hold a review the next day. The troops were to\r\nbe withdrawn for the moment from the line of defense, and the review\r\nwas to be held at Mustapha. I had ventured to suggest that I might go\r\nand see the soldiers in their own lines, hoping thus to get near the\r\nfiring, a natural desire enough, seeing I wore a volunteer uniform in\r\nspite of my thirteen years, but nobody listened to me, and to Mustapha\r\nI was taken, mounted on the ex-Dey's white mule, which an artilleryman\r\npersisted in leading by the bridle, in spite of all my indignant\r\nprotests.\r\n\r\nA real downright review that was! The men had been fighting all the\r\nmorning, and Zouaves and linesmen alike looked fierce indeed, with\r\ntanned faces, eyes reddened by the smoke, and a black mark at the\r\ncorner of every mouth, from biting off the ends of the cartridges. The\r\nZouaves had only just been raised, and were not a bit like the Zouaves\r\nof the present day. The ranks consisted mostly of Arabs, who wore\r\nalmost the same uniform as the present one, only with bare legs and\r\nslippers on their feet, mingled with Parisian roughs, drafted out of\r\nthe \"Regiments de la Charte,\" most of them wearing blouses and caps.\r\nMany of the non-commissioned officers had come from the Royal Guard,\r\nand still wore their blue cloaks. The excessively whimsical get-up of\r\nthe officers put the finishing touch to this motley show. Most of them\r\nhad adopted the Mameluke dress--white turbans, huge trousers, yellow\r\nboots, a sun embroidered on their backs, and a scimitar. After the\r\nZouaves I saw the squadron of \"Chasseurs Algeriens,\" the nucleus of the\r\nfuture \"Chasseurs d'Afrique,\" march past. They wore Turkish dress and\r\nturbans too, all but their commanding officer, a big bearded artillery\r\ncaptain, who wore a burnous and Arab pistols over his uniform. His name\r\nwas Marey-Monge, and he was a general of division when he died.\r\n\r\nAfter the review I was taken back to my ship. The frigate sailed for\r\nPort Mahon, where we underwent a long quarantine, and thence to Toulon,\r\nwhere we arrived just as the squadron which had forced the mouth of the\r\nTagus, under the orders of Admiral Roussin, returned, I went over those\r\nfine ships, and especially the Algesiras, with many a regret that the\r\nArthemise had had no share in the fray. The commander of the Algesiras,\r\nM. Moulac, a tall, strongly built, grey-headed man, the bravest of the\r\nbrave, who had fought boldly in all our naval struggles with England,\r\ntold me a story which impressed me deeply, and which I here transcribe\r\njust as it remains fixed in my memory:--\r\n\r\n\"It has been blowing great guns, as you know, all the last few days.\r\nThe ship was running under easy sail when I heard a shout of 'Man\r\noverboard!' The lifebuoy was thrown, and, looking astern, I saw the man\r\nhad caught it. But it was a raging sea--I saw and felt that to try and\r\nlower a boat to save the poor wretch must expose the men who manned it\r\nto the greatest danger. The crew read in my face the fearful struggle\r\ngoing on within me, and twenty, thirty, perhaps forty volunteers,\r\nheaded by officers and midshipmen, crowded round me, beseeching me\r\nalmost on their knees: 'Let us save our comrade, sir! we can't desert\r\nhim!' I was weak enough to yield. By unexpected good luck, we managed\r\nto lower a boat without accident, and she started manned by a dozen\r\nmen. We saw her, by still greater good fortune, get to the poor fellow\r\nand save him, and I was steering about so as to make it easier for her\r\nto get back, when a huge wave broke over her. A shout of horror went up\r\nfrom her, and then silence. In another minute I saw my boat capsized,\r\non the crest of a wave, with two or three men, one of them a\r\nmidshipman, clinging to the keel. To shorten their agony, I made as\r\nthough I was going ahead. The middy understood that I was forced to\r\nabandon them, for he waved a farewell and let himself go. I had been\r\nweak, but I was cruelly punished. Thirteen men drowned instead of one,\r\nand by my fault!\"\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the severe expression that came over the\r\ncommander's face as he added, laying his hand on my shoulder, \"Some\r\nday, boy, you may be in command. May the thought of me remind you\r\nalways that duty is inexorable!\"\r\n\r\nAfter this final episode in my first cruise I went ashore, but I went\r\nashore a sailor to the core, and my one idea, when I got back to Paris,\r\nwas to acquire the technical information needed for my profession. To\r\nthis the years 1832 and 1833 were devoted. M. Guerard, a charming\r\nfellow, universally liked and an incomparable instructor, was my\r\nmathematical teacher. A lieutenant in the navy, M. Hernoux, put me\r\nthrough the course of study of the Naval School. At the same time I set\r\nassiduously to work to learn drawing. My first master in this line was\r\nM. Barbier, the father of Jules Barbier, the poet and librettist, who,\r\nwith Emile Augier, was a class-mate of my young brothers. I did\r\nwatercolours too, under an Englishman, William Callow, and oils in\r\nGudin's studio. But my real master, who taught me to draw, and led and\r\nguided me, and gave me my taste for things artistic, was Ary Scheffer,\r\nwith whom I remained on terms of the closest intimacy until his death.\r\n\r\nIt was somewhere about this time that a French army entered Belgium,\r\nand besieged and took the citadel of Antwerp, and during this campaign\r\nmy elder brothers first had the honour of leading our soldiers under\r\nfire. Antwerp once taken, the French Government, content with having\r\ngiven a proof of activity to Europe, and shown everybody what our\r\nlegions could do, at once recalled the army, and my father went to\r\nreview it in the cantonments on the frontier where it lay. I made this\r\njourney with him. The troops were splendid, full of zeal and\r\nconfidence. I was shown one infantry brigade, which at the time of\r\nmobilization had done marches of sixty to seventy kilometres, so as to\r\nreach the given point at the hour fixed upon. It was an interesting\r\njourney, though a very trying one. Every day there was an entry into\r\nsome town, and a partial review, in Siberian cold. And every evening\r\nthere was a banquet, and every night a ball. The chief review was held\r\nat Valenciennes. The troops looked magnificent, drawn up on the snow,\r\nand, though it was so terribly cold, a brilliant sun lighted up the\r\nsplendid military scene. It was enlivened by a little incident. The\r\ncommandant of the fortress of Valenciennes was an old colonel, who had\r\nre-engaged in 1830, after having dabbled somewhat in conspiracy, under\r\nthe Restoration. His name was M. de la Huberdiere, and he had had\r\nhimself a hat made exactly like Napoleon's, and wore it just after the\r\nsame fashion.\r\n\r\nDuring the march past, either from sheer keenness or because he wanted\r\nto attract attention to himself, he edged himself gradually in front of\r\nthe staff, on the side where the troops advanced, till at last he was\r\nabreast of the King, so that the troops appeared to be marching past\r\nhim. This provoked one of my father's aides-de-camp, Heymes, who went\r\nup to him, and said, saluting, \"It seems to me, Colonel, you would be\r\nbetter placed still if you were on the King's horse!\" The shriek of\r\nlaughter which greeted this remark may be imagined.\r\n\r\nThis same Heymes, one of the few survivors of General Leclerc's\r\nexpedition to St. Domingo, had, on leaving that charnel-house, become\r\naide-de-camp to Marshal Ney. He it was who, during the famous retreat\r\nfrom Russia, was sent to ask the general who was blowing up the\r\nBeresina bridges to suspend the work of destruction, so as to allow of\r\nthe passage of the column with the wounded, who must otherwise be\r\ndoomed to death. It was worth seeing the expression of his face, severe\r\nenough already, when he repeated the answer the general in question\r\ngave him, with the most southern of accents, \"What, my dear fellow! The\r\nwounded! The Emperor has decided to sacrifice them!\"\r\n\r\nThe worthy Heymes did my father a great service a short time after the\r\nreview which has led me to mention him. It was at the moment of the\r\ninsurrection in June 1832. We were at St. Cloud. It was well known that\r\nthe agitators of every description intended to make a demonstration on\r\nthe occasion of General Lamarque's funeral, but the demonstration was\r\nnot expected to be of any importance. However, at about five in the\r\nevening, we beheld Heymes, in plain clothes, gallop into the courtyard,\r\non a dragoon's charger, covered with foam. He had just come from the\r\ndemonstration, and had witnessed that ordinary prologue to revolutions,\r\npillage and massacre--pillage of gunsmiths' shops, and massacre of the\r\nofficers of the 6th Dragoons, shot down with pistols, without any\r\nprovocation whatever, at the head of their squadrons in line.\r\n\r\n\"You must come to Paris, Sire,\" he said, as he dismounted. My father\r\ndid not wait for him to say it twice, and an hour later he was at the\r\nTuileries, thence giving the impulse which nipped the revolutionary\r\nattempt in the bud. The next morning he was on horseback amidst the\r\ntroops and the National Guard, which hemmed the rioters into the ward\r\nof St. Merri. An incident occurred there which was highly\r\ncharacteristic of that Parisian population, in whom a generous chord\r\nwill always thrill, even in its maddest moments. The King, with my\r\nbrother Nemours and his staff, had gone down the Rue des Arcis, at the\r\nend of which lively firing was heard. The troops who were massed in the\r\nstreet greeted the sovereign with cheers, and he, going forward,\r\nreached a square in which the fighting was actually going on. The\r\ncheering ran from one to another, the soldiers who were engaged ceasing\r\ntheir fire to join in. This change in the music struck the insurgents\r\nalso at last. They stopped firing too, and were to be seen appearing at\r\nthe windows, rifle in hand, taking off their caps to the plucky King,\r\nwhom they would not have hesitated to shoot at a minute before.\r\n\r\nI need not say that as soon as the King and his escort disappeared down\r\na side street the fight began again, merrier than ever, and the 42nd\r\nRegiment of the line carried the monastery of St. Merri. An historic\r\nregiment that 42nd! After having fought against the \"White\"\r\ninsurrection in the Vendee and the republican insurrection at the St.\r\nMerri monastery, caused the breakdown of Prince Napoleon's Boulogne\r\nadventure, occupied the Chamber of Deputies on the 2nd of December, and\r\nheroically lost its whole strength twice over in the siege of Paris, it\r\nhas had the good fortune of being almost the only one of our regiments\r\nto keep its arms and its colours amidst all our mishaps.\r\n\r\nThere was no further interruption to the course of my studies, except a\r\njourney of the King's to Normandy, on which I accompanied him. The\r\nofficial object of this journey was to hold a review, at Cherbourg, of\r\nthe squadron which had operated, in concert with an English one, in the\r\nNorth Sea, during the arrangement of the Belgian question. But its\r\nchief end was to go through the Departments in Normandy and enter into\r\nrelations with the honest folk who populated them.\r\n\r\nThe trip was fruitful in incident. The first happened at Bernay, the\r\nnative town of the virtuous Dupont de l'Eure, one of those virtuous\r\nindividuals who would virtuously have your head cut off sooner than\r\ndrop the smallest iota of their vulgar and utopian ideas. The prefect,\r\nM. Passy, had warned the King that amongst the addresses that would be\r\nread to him on his arrival there would be one which would give him a\r\nlecture. Thus warned, we arrived, and having mounted a platform in the\r\nopen air, with a verdant dome above it, the reception and the addresses\r\nbegan. There was nothing very particular at first; at last a \"President\r\nde Tribunal\" advanced, and the way he made his bow with his prim look,\r\nand the curiosity which stretched every neck, told me at once that the\r\nKing was to get the promised lecture. It came, indeed, very studied,\r\nand very impertinent too. Everybody listened in silence. It was all\r\nabout courtiers, the danger of listening to flatterers, and so forth.\r\nAs it ended, the heads of the president and his friends all came up\r\nwith a \"Take that, my fine fellow\" look.\r\n\r\nThen the King replied with the utmost politeness, thanking M. le\r\nPresident for the advice he had been good enough to give him.\r\n\"Flatterers and courtiers,\" he said, \"have indeed done much mischief,\r\nand, sad to say, the race is not yet extinct, for nowadays there are\r\ncourtiers who are far more dangerous than the flatterers of princes and\r\nof kings--those courtiers and flatterers of the people, who to buy a\r\nvain and contemptible popularity suggest to them dreams which are\r\nunrealizable and which bring them to misfortune,\" &c. On this head my\r\nfather bestowed a well-directed hiding on the president, which was\r\nconstantly interrupted by a running fire of applause, so that the\r\nworthy gentleman ended by not knowing which way to look. Amongst other\r\neminently French qualities, my father possessed the gift of repartee to\r\nthe highest degree. He always knew how to use it, though with a\r\npoliteness and good nature which softened whatever might be too sharp\r\nabout its sting. This time the blow went home. Our journey, thus begun,\r\nwas continued amid constantly increasing cordiality and success. It was\r\na somewhat tiring manner of life. We went by short stages, from one\r\nreception to another. Everywhere the National Guard and the troops were\r\nunder arms. When they were in considerable numbers, we mounted horses,\r\neither lent or requisitioned beforehand. In the evening, wherever we\r\nslept, there would be a great banquet, and generally a ball as well. It\r\nwas the duty of us young folk to lead the dancing--a pleasant task\r\nenough, if we could have chosen our partners among the pretty women\r\nwhom I was beginning to notice, in spite of my being only fourteen, and\r\nof whom there were many, especially at Grandville and St. Lo. But our\r\npartners were given to us officially, and were chosen from the families\r\nof the authorities. We exerted ourselves to be pleasant in spite of\r\nthat. I do not know whether I was succeeding too much or too little at\r\na ball one night, but I saw the husband's head suddenly appear between\r\nmy partner and myself, with the observation, \"Well, my wife's not\r\nbad-looking, is she?\" and he smacked his lips like a man who has eaten\r\na good thing.\r\n\r\nFalaise was the culminating point in our journey as far as incidents\r\nwent. We were to make a halt there, and, as fifteen battalions of the\r\nNational Guard were collected, the aide-de-camp, who did duty as\r\nquartermaster too, had seen to getting suitable mounts for the King,\r\nfor us, and for Marshals Soult and Gerard, who accompanied us. The\r\nfamous fair at Guibray, near Falaise, was just over, and a circus which\r\nhad come to enliven it was still there. The circus horses were laid\r\nhands on, and when we arrived we were agreeably surprised to find fine\r\nwhite horses awaiting us instead of the ordinary nags and troop-horses\r\nwe generally had to ride. So we got into the saddle, and the review\r\nbegan. Just as the King reached the right flank of the line, the band\r\nbegan to play, and then an unforeseen event occurred Our proud\r\ncoursers, thinking that they were at a performance, set each of them to\r\ndo his own particular duty. The King, Marshal Soult, and two others of\r\nour party were riding the horses who did that trick called the\r\n\"Grand-Ecart,\" in which all four horses draw together at the same\r\nmoment. When their riders pulled at their bridles, the four horses,\r\nfeeling themselves reined up, instantly fell into the usual circus\r\ncanter. Another horse kept wheeling round and round, and confusion\r\nbecame general, nobody guessing what had happened until the\r\naide-de-camp smote his brow, and stopped the band.\r\n\r\nThe trouble did not end there. The National Guard was in proud\r\npossession of one gun, which it had horsed somehow or other. A jolt\r\nbroke the axle-tree, just as it was going past. Then there was a\r\nhalf-squadron of cavalry mounted on stallions or geldings. But the\r\ntrumpeter was on a mare, which fact brought difficulty on poor\r\nRosinante during the march past. In the evening there was a great ball\r\nin a huge temporary shed, with tiers of seats all round it. All of a\r\nsudden half the tiers collapsed, like cards, and all the ladies were to\r\nbe seen, though almost unhurt, on their backs with their legs in the\r\nair, amidst a most awful dust! I must confess we ungallantly seized the\r\nopportunity of the confusion to go off to our beds. The King, too, did\r\nthe same, thus escaping from the persecutions of the Polish refugees,\r\ninterned at Falaise, who had come to the ball in lancer uniforms worthy\r\nof the merry-andrews at the opera balls, to pester him with their\r\npetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n1834-1836\r\n\r\n\r\nMy technical education recommenced more vigorously than ever when this\r\njourney was over. It had been decided that before being definitely\r\nplaced on the Navy List I must pass my public examination as a\r\nfirst-class pupil at Brest. So I was prepared accordingly, and received\r\nthose successive doses of instruction which the English designate by\r\nthe characteristic word \"cramming,\" for which the only French\r\nequivalent I can find is \"gaver.\" My mathematical teacher held a class\r\nfor a limited number of youths in a house in the Rue Git-le-Coeur, and\r\nthither I went, to gain the habit of speaking the language of algebra\r\nin public. In contrast to my memories of school lessons, I have the\r\npleasantest recollections of those I received in that den--for den it\r\nwas! This, perhaps, is on account of the good fellows I met there, and\r\nwho have been my friends ever since, and also owing to the charm our\r\nkindly instructor wielded over us all. I do not believe there is a\r\nsingle one of his pupils, from the illustrious Marshal Canrobert down\r\nthrough my contemporaries, Excelmans, Bonie, Morny, Daumesnil, the\r\nGreffulhe brothers, Friant, Baudin, Valbezen, and many more, to the\r\nyounger generation that came after me, who does not cherish the most\r\ngrateful and affectionate feelings for the worthy Guerard. When we were\r\nclose on the time for my examination, he had me questioned several\r\ntimes over by the official examiners of the Ecole Polytechnique and\r\nothers, so as to accustom me to the surprises of public examinations. I\r\nthus passed through the hands of Baron Reynaud, and of Messieurs\r\nBourdon, Delille, and Lefebure de Fourcy. This last inspired me with\r\ndownright terror, on account of his reputation for methodical\r\nbrutality. One of my class-mates had reported to me that well-known\r\ncolloquy between him and a candidate who got confused, at he stood\r\nchalk in hand before the black board, and who heard M. Lefebure de\r\nFourcy's voice saying calmly, \"Waiter, just bring a bundle of hay for\r\nthis pupil's breakfast.\" To which the indignant pupil promptly added,\r\n\"Waiter, bring two: the examiner will breakfast with me.\" At length,\r\ncrammed to the muzzle with nautical and astronomical calculations, and\r\nall the other sciences the official programme demanded, I started for\r\nBrest, kept up even as I drove along, in the highest state of\r\npreparation. There were a few interludes during the journey. Certain\r\nspots in Brittany were still, early in that year 1834, disturbed by the\r\nconsequences of the rising in 1831, and my passage was the signal in\r\nseveral places for what we call, in parliamentary language, \"mouvements\r\nen sens divers,\" conflicting emotions. Sometimes I saw white\r\nhandkerchiefs waving or twisted round hats, doing duty for cockades. At\r\nother points the tricolour demonstrations took a quaint form. I\r\nremember at one place where we changed horses my carriage drew up\r\nbetween two rows of National Guards, who were keeping back a\r\nconsiderable crowd of people. At the carriage door appeared the Mayor\r\nwith his scarf round his waist, saluting me with this remark: \"Sir,\r\nthis place is but a hole, but it is a hole in which hearts devoted to\r\nyour august family are throbbing;\" while at the other the village\r\npriest and his clergy, all in surplice and alb, struck up\r\n\r\n Soldats du drapeau tricolore\r\n D'Orieans toi qui la's Porte,\r\n\r\nand so right through the Parisian to a brass accompaniment.\r\n\r\nMy examination was held in the great hall of the Prefecture of the Navy\r\nat Brest, before a board of officers, engineers, and professors. It was\r\na public one; but what alarmed me most at its outset was the presence\r\nof all the pupils of the Naval School, who riled the tiers of seats on\r\none side of the hall. Luckily the sight of some old chums amongst them\r\ncheered me up, and as the examination went pretty well I soon saw on\r\ntheir youthful faces, just as actors, they say, read their coming\r\nsuccess on their audience at the theatre, that my cause was won, and\r\nthat I was accepted, not only by the scientific big-wigs but by the\r\nuniversal suffrages of my contemporaries. Yet I was rejoiced when the\r\nsitting was over!\r\n\r\nSome days later, at L'Orient, I joined the Sirene frigate, Commander\r\nd'Oysonville, as midshipman, and started on an ocean voyage. This\r\ncruise was uneventful, except for a few little incidents such as always\r\noccur in a sailor's life.\r\n\r\nThus, being in the maintop one day, when topsails were being reefed in\r\na strong breeze, a rope chanced to break, twisted round my legs, and\r\ncarried me into mid air, head downwards. If the sinewy arms of the\r\ncaptain of the maintop and one of the top men had not caught me as I\r\npassed, I should have fallen into the sea or on the deck, and either\r\nalternative would have been disagreeable. Later on, at the end of the\r\ncruise, we re-entered Brest in a south-westerly squall, under\r\ncircumstances which made a very useful impression on me.\r\n\r\nWe had bad weather for some days, no reliable observations had been\r\ntaken, and we were very doubtful as to the frigate's position. Driving\r\nas we were at a great rate, before the gale, we were reckoning on the\r\noccasional partial lightening of the fog to catch sight of and\r\nrecognize some point of land or rock, according to which we might steer\r\nour course amongst the reefs which swarm at the entrance of Brest\r\nharbour. We had to be ready to change our course and go about at any\r\nmoment. Everybody was on deck, straining his eyes to try and see\r\nsomething, cool, and steady in nerve, as a well-disciplined body of men\r\nis in face of any danger. But one man was not present, our commanding\r\nofficer, whose prompt judgment and word of command alone could bring us\r\nfrom perilous uncertainty into safety. Our commander was below, in his\r\ncabin, and there he persisted in staying, in spite of the indirect\r\nefforts made by the officer of the watch, the second in command, and\r\nthe navigating officer to get him out of it. It was incomprehensible,\r\nand at the same time very alarming. Commander d'Oysonville, who was\r\nchurchwarden of St. Roch when he died, was a kind and very honourable\r\nman, but nobody could possibly have been less of a sailor. He was a\r\nfirst-class organizer, and he carried his theories to the extremist\r\npossible limit. He had one, amongst others, that the captain of a ship\r\nought to command her from his cabin, so as never to appear before his\r\ncrew except on the most solemn occasions, and it was for the sake of\r\nbeing true to this principle that he refused to show himself in the\r\ncircumstances I speak of. His obstinacy very nearly cost us dear, for\r\non the earnestly longed-for break in the fog suddenly taking place a\r\npoint of land was seen. We thought we recognized the Island of Molenes:\r\nthe commander was hurriedly informed, and he sent an order to change\r\nour course. A lightening at another point in the horizon showed us some\r\nrocks. \"The Pierres Vertes ahead!\" sang out a coasting pilot specially\r\nshipped for the voyage, who was looking out from his perch on the\r\nforeyards, and the navigating officer tore off again to warn the\r\ncommanding officer. During all these comings and goings the curtain of\r\nfog came down again, and we went driving on towards the reefs at the\r\nrate of twelve knots an hour. It could not be allowed to go on! With or\r\nwithout leave the second officer took the command, and put an end to an\r\nimpossible situation. Our worthy commander only appeared just as we\r\nwere dropping anchor in the roadstead, when all uncertainty was over,\r\nand I seem yet to see the looks that greeted his tardy appearance.\r\nEverybody's anxiety had been increased by knowing how he had lost the\r\nship Le Superbe, seventy-four guns, off the Island of Paros, some years\r\nbefore, and under very peculiar circumstances. For my own part, I\r\nlearnt on this occasion what everything has confirmed me in since--the\r\ndanger of uncertain and divided authority either at sea or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhen I got back to Paris, having finished the technical portion of my\r\neducation, I went on with a course of history, with my sisters,\r\nespecially my sister Mary, I applied myself with the utmost fervour to\r\nmy drawing. I worked with her daily, under the direction of Ary\r\nScheffer, and I recollect our grief one morning on finding the Jeanne\r\nd'Arc she was modelling in wax for Versailles, melted by an overheated\r\nstove, had collapsed the whole length of its framework, to such an\r\nextent as to become the merest cripple. By dint of lowering the\r\ntemperature, and the use of a screw-jack applied in a peculiar manner,\r\nand vigorously turned by Ary Scheffer and myself, Jeanne d'Arc rose up\r\nagain upon her framework, and the damage was soon made good.\r\n\r\nAbout that time too, influenced by the genius of Victor Hugo, my sister\r\nClementine and I were seized with a perfect passion for old Paris, that\r\ndelightful Paris of ancient story. We had Sauval's thick volumes, we\r\nhad searched all the old books for traces of the ancient legends, and\r\nwe used to spend our afternoons going to see the sites and hunt for the\r\nremains of the places we had read about, There is not a church or a\r\nmonument of which we did not know every detail, nor an alley or a\r\ncorner in the quarters of the Halles, the Hotel de Ville, the Arsenal,\r\nthe Temple, and the Pantheon that we had not carefully explored with\r\nthe most fervent interest. What joy it was to us one day when we were\r\ntrying to trace the Hotel St. Paul, the old palace of our kings, to\r\ncome upon a course of masonry which had undoubtedly belonged to it!\r\n\r\nAlthough I was on shore, I was still devoted to my profession. I used\r\nto see almost all the naval officers who passed through Paris, and\r\ntried to push forward those whom the general body of the profession\r\nsingled out as being likely commanding officers. These matters of\r\npromotion, as well as any others that affected naval interests, brought\r\nme into daily touch with the ministers, and my relations with M Theirs\r\ndate from that time. Yet, oddly enough, it was riding on horseback that\r\nbrought us together! During the King's stays at Camping and\r\nFontainebleau, and his country trips to Versailles, St. Cloud, and\r\nRaunchy, when he used to invite foreign visitors and his ministers, and\r\ngreat personages in general, to join in his excursions, M. Thiers was\r\nas much bored as I was at having to go in the carriages and chars a\r\nbancs which drove in a long line one behind the other. We much\r\npreferred accompanying them on horseback, and nothing delighted the\r\nlittle minister more than to let his mount tear along full gallop with\r\na loose rein. He had a very firm seat, and was very plucky, especially\r\non a horse of ours called \"Le Vendome,\" which in his southern accent he\r\npronounced \"Le Vanndomme.\" I remember one day, at Fontaineblean, as he\r\nwas galloping along beside me on that same \"Vanndomme,\" we passed by a\r\nyoung fagot-gatherer, bending under her load. She straightened herself\r\nat the noise; it was very hot, her jacket had come unbuttoned, and\r\nshowed a bare white very well furnished bust. She smiled to M. Thiers,\r\nwho pulled his horse up short, turned back to thrust a handful of small\r\nchange into the young woman's palm, and started off again full tear, as\r\nif he had had an electric shock, jumping the fallen trees with a\r\nresolution and energy which I had never known him show before.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion he proved himself a less brilliant horseman. The\r\nstatue of Napoleon, that statue which is put up and taken down in every\r\nRevolution, was to be ceremoniously replaced on the top of its column.\r\nThe troops and the National Guard were under arms, with their bands and\r\ndrums, headed by a splendid drum-major, massed at the foot of the\r\ncolumn. We arrived in state by the Rue Castiglione, so that the column\r\nsurmounted by the statue, covered by a veil that was to drop at a given\r\nsignal, faced us just as we came out upon the square M. Thiers, in full\r\nuniform, with his minister's hat and feathers, and again riding\r\n\"Vanndomme,\" struck in his spurs, left the procession at full gallop,\r\nand passed before my father, shouting at the very top of his falsetto\r\nvoice, \"I take your Majesty's pleasure\" the words being accompanied by\r\na wave of his hat which ill-natured people might have said was copied\r\nfrom General Rapp's gesture in Gerard's picture of the Battle of\r\nAusterlitz at the Louvre. On this signal the drums beat, the bands\r\nplayed, the statue was unveiled--but M. Thiers had lost control of\r\n\"Vanndomme,\" who, wild with enthusiasm, bolted head down, overthrowing\r\ndrums and drum-major, while the little minister clung to his back like\r\na monkey in a circus. It was a comical sight! But far from laughable\r\nunder this same ministry of M. Thiers were the perpetual attempts upon\r\nmy father's life. The speculators in revolution, who had been\r\nencouraged by their easy success in 1830, grew discouraged after\r\nseveral like essays at risings had been severely put down. They then\r\nfell back on assassination. The most serious attempt was Fieschi's, on\r\nJuly 28, 1835. Together with my two eldest brothers I was to accompany\r\nthe King to a review of the National Guard and the regular army, drawn\r\nup on the Boulevards. All of us who were to take part in the\r\nprocession, princes, marshals, generals, and aides-de-camp, were\r\nassembled in the drawing-room at the Tuileries, next to the Throne\r\nRoom, when the Minister of the Interior, M. Thiers, burst in like a\r\nwhirlwind, and, beckoning to my two brothers and me, led us into the\r\nembrasure of a window. \"My dear princes,\" said he, looking at us over\r\nhis spectacles, \"it is more than likely there will be an attempt on the\r\nlife of the King, your father, to-day. We have been warned from several\r\nquarters. They say there will be an infernal machine somewhere near the\r\nAmbigu Theatre. It is very vague, but there must be something at the\r\nbottom of it all. We have had all the houses near the Ambigu searched\r\nthis morning to no purpose. Should the King be warned? Should the\r\nreview be put off?\"\r\n\r\nWe answered unanimously that the King must be warned but that, brave as\r\nhe was well known to be, he would never consent to having the review\r\nput off. So it turned out.\r\n\r\n\"Look well after your father,\" repeated M. Thiers, and we mounted our\r\nhorses. The review went on well enough, except that we all remarked the\r\npresence of a large number of insolent-looking individuals, with red\r\ncarnations in their button-holes--the members, evidently, of the secret\r\nsocieties, who had not been warned of what was going to happen, but to\r\nbe ready for anything that might happen We had not been able to take\r\nany precautions, beyond dividing the care of watching over the King's\r\nperson between my brothers and myself and the aides-de-camp on duty One\r\nof us with an aide-de-camp, was to take it in turn to keep just behind\r\nhis horse, with our eye on the troops and the crowd, so as to interpose\r\nif we noticed any suspicious gesture. My turn had come to take the post\r\nof watcher, with General Heymes, aide-de-camp in waiting, on my right.\r\nOn my left I had Lieutenant-Colonel Rieussec, commanding the legion of\r\nthe National Guard before which we were passing. Close to the Ambigu,\r\nnot the present theatre--the neighbourhood of which had been\r\nsearched--but a former Ambigu, which had been shut up, opposite the\r\nJardin Turc cafe, we heard a sort of platoon firing like the discharge\r\nof a mitrailleuse, and raising my eyes at the noise I saw smoke coming\r\nfrom a window which was half closed by an outside shutter.\r\n\r\nI had no time to notice more, and at the moment I did not perceive that\r\nmy left-hand neighbour, Colonel Rieussec, was killed, that Heymes'\r\nclothes were riddled with bullets and his nose carried away, nor that\r\nmy own horse was wounded. All I saw was my father holding his left arm,\r\nand saying to me over his shoulder, \"I'm hit!\" And so he was: one\r\nbullet had grazed his forehead, another spent one had given him the\r\nblow of which he complained, and a third had passed through his horse's\r\nneck. But that we only knew afterwards, and it was only afterwards too\r\nthat we learnt the instrument of the crime had been an infernal\r\nmachine. Our first thought was that the firing would go on, so I struck\r\nspurs into my horse, and seizing my father's by the bridle, while my\r\ntwo brothers struck it behind with their swords, we led him swiftly\r\nthrough the scene of immense confusion that ensued--horses riderless,\r\nor bearing wounded men, swaying in their seats, broken ranks, and\r\npeople in blouses, who rushed upon the King, to touch him or his\r\nhorse, with frantic shouts of \"Long live the King!\" As we retired, I\r\njust saw the taking by assault of the house whence the discharge had\r\ncome. The young aides-de-camp had dismounted, leaving their horses\r\nloose, and with the Municipal Guards and the police they scaled the\r\nhouse and the one next door (the Cafe Barfetti), climbing on to the\r\nverandah and smashing in the windows. Then the review began again. We\r\nhad ascertained the King was not wounded, nor we ourselves, but we were\r\nnot aware as yet either of the great number or of the names of the\r\nvictims. Hereupon M. Thiers appeared beside us, with his white\r\nkerseymere trousers covered with blood. All he said to us was, \"The\r\npoor Marshal!\"\r\n\r\n\"Whom do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mortier! He fell dead across me, crying out, 'Oh, my God!'\"\r\n\r\nWe reckoned ourselves up as we went along. Forty-two dead or wounded:\r\ndead--Marshal Mortier, General Lachasse de Verigny, Colonels Raffet and\r\nRieussec, Captain Willatte, aide-de-camp to the Minister of War, seven\r\nothers, and two women; wounded--Generals Heymes, Comte de Colbert,\r\nPelet, Blin, and many more. The Due de Broglie was hit full in the\r\nchest by a bullet that flattened out on his star of the Legion of\r\nHonour.\r\n\r\nIt was not far from the scene of the crime to the farthest end of the\r\nline of troops, so the procession soon retraced its steps. The roadway\r\nwhere the blow had been struck was nothing but a pool of blood. The\r\nwounded and almost all the dead had been carried away, and I only saw\r\none corpse, flat on its face in the mud, among the dead horses, but all\r\nthe blood about frightened our horses so that we had hard work to get\r\non.\r\n\r\nOn the square of the Chateau d'Eau a huge and furious crowd surging\r\nround the station house, which was protected by numerous Municipal\r\nGuards, showed us the assassin, or one of them, had been arrested. The\r\nreview was concluded, and my father's self-control was sorely tried by\r\nthe unanimity and fervour of the acclamations of which he was the\r\nobject from all sides, from soldiers and civilians alike. It is\r\nunnecessary to add that we did not see any more red carnations.\r\n\r\nThe march past was to take place in the Place Vendome, and the\r\nchancellor's offices were full of ladies of the official world,\r\ngathered round my mother. We dismounted for a moment to go and speak to\r\nthem, and here again a moving scene took place. We had been able to\r\nsend on an aide-de-camp to assure my mother and aunt and my sisters\r\nthat we were safe and sound, but our messenger had not had time to\r\nlearn the names of all the victims. So when we mounted the stairs of\r\nthe chancellor's offices, some of us all bespattered with blood, all\r\nthese women, their brilliant dresses contrasting sadly with their\r\nterrified eyes, rushed upon us to see whether those they loved were\r\namongst us. Some of them were never to see their dear ones again!\r\n\r\nShortly after this bloody episode in our national history I joined the\r\nDidon frigate, Captain de Parseval, as enseigne de vaisseau. My new\r\ncommanding officer, who had joined the navy at a very early age, had\r\nserved as a midshipman on board Villeneuve's vessel, the Bucentaure, at\r\nTrafalgar. He was in command of the mizzentop, and saw Nelson's ship,\r\nthe Victory, pass slowly astern of the Bucentaure--so close that her\r\nyards caught the other's ensign--while the fifty guns of the British\r\nship poured their fire one after the other into the stern of the French\r\none, sweeping her gun-deck from end to end, and laying low four hundred\r\nof her crew. After this commencement of his career, Commander de\r\nParseval had spent his whole life in fighting and adventure. He had\r\nbeen in three shipwrecks, one specially terrible one on the Isle de\r\nSable, near the coast of Nova Scotia, in which (he was a lieutenant at\r\nthe time) he swam ashore to get help and save the crew of his frigate.\r\nHe died with the rank of admiral, after having had the chief command of\r\nthe Baltic Fleet during the Crimean War. He was a charming fellow,\r\nslight and smart-looking, very carefully dressed, as resolute in\r\ncommand as he was formal as to politeness, a consummate seaman,\r\nmanaging his ship in first-rate style. I sailed a great deal with him,\r\nand learned much from him, and from the very first I felt a personal\r\naffection for him, which was never belied, and which he reciprocated.\r\nAn extra bond of sympathy existed between us--when I was just becoming\r\ndeaf, he was deaf already.\r\n\r\nWe made a cruise for drill, on the Didon, doing a deal of navigation in\r\nall sorts of weathers, and I performed the duties of captain of the\r\nwatch--my first attempt at command, my first trial in a responsible\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe winter season of 1836 found me back in Paris, where I began my\r\nclasses again, and gave myself up in particular to my passion for the\r\nfine arts. This taste of mine was the cause of a terrible blowing up I\r\ngot from my father. The jury of the Salon of 1836 refused a picture of\r\nMarilhat's--I think it was his first. Some of the artists who had seen\r\nthe young painter's work thought this decision unjust. They grumbled,\r\nand their grumbling got as far as the newspapers. I was curious enough\r\nto go and see the picture at Durand-Ruel's. It was a view of Rome by\r\ntwilight, seen between great umbrella pines, I thought it a splendid\r\npicture, and spurred somewhat, I confess, by a spirit of contradiction,\r\nI was seized with an eager desire to acquire it. But I had not a\r\nhalfpenny of my own, there was my difficulty! To overcome it, I laid\r\nsiege to my aunt Adelaide, who doted on her brother's children as if\r\nthey had been her own, and who never (and well the rogues knew it!)\r\ncould resist their wheedling. I succeeded, as I had hoped, and\r\nMarilhat's picture became my property. But certain of the jury went and\r\ncomplained to the King, and I was greeted with, \"Oho! so you are going\r\nto set yourself up in opposition! I've trouble enough already with\r\nthose artists! It's the Civil List (that means it's me) that takes them\r\nin at the Louvre. I can't be the only judge as to what is accepted and\r\nwhat isn't. I have to have a jury, the Institute is good enough to\r\nundertake the job--all its members are dying of fright, and I shield\r\nthem under my own responsibility, just as I do my ministers, although\r\nit's contrary to the letter of the law--and it's you, one of my own\r\nsons, who comes and sets an example of insubordination! Much obliged to\r\nyou, sir!\"\r\n\r\nMy picture was inspected all the same I need hardly say the\r\ngrand-parents pronounced it frightful, a regular daub. I hung my head\r\nunder this double-barrelled censure, and drooped my ears like a whipped\r\nspaniel, but I stuck to my opinion, and likewise to my Marilhat. I\r\nthink it was shortly after this little adventure that I added another\r\n\"daub\" to my \"gallery.\" One morning as I was busy modelling (for I\r\ndabbled in sculpture too) in my sister Marie's studio, Ary Scheffer\r\ncame in, and began telling me about an unknown artist he had met, quite\r\nyoung, a man of undoubted talent, who was in a terribly\r\npoverty-stricken condition. Six hundred francs would take him out of\r\nhis difficulties, and he would give two small pictures, pendants, which\r\nhe had just finished, in exchange.\r\n\r\n\"What do they represent?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"They are both landscapes, connected with episodes in Walter Scott's\r\nnovels. One represents the charge of Claverhouse in the Covenanters,\r\nand the other the Army of Charles the Bold crossing the Alps. Come!\"\r\nadded Scheffer, turning to me. \"Be good-natured. If you have six\r\nhundred francs, give them to me!\"\r\n\r\nI chanced to have the money, and gave it him. \"What's your protege's\r\nname?\" asked I.\r\n\r\n\"Theodore Rousseau.\" Fancy that great artist selling his pictures in\r\npairs, as furniture, in fact--for bread!\r\n\r\nIn 1836, too, on February 28, I was present at the first performance of\r\nLes Huguenots, an opera which enchanted me. The action, the music, the\r\nstage setting, the interpretation, made an ensemble that was unique, a\r\nwork of art that defied comparison. Nothing on the stage to my mind,\r\nhas ever surpassed the duet in the fourth act as created and sung by\r\nNourrit and Mlle. Falcon. Inspired by the musical and dramatic\r\nsituation, these two artists were completely carried away, and their\r\nemotion was as infectious as it was apparent. Mlle. Falcon had a way of\r\ninterrupting her singing, to speak the words, \"Raoul, ils te tueront!\"\r\nwith an expression into which her whole soul was thrown, which was the\r\nvery embodiment of passion. Ah! Passion indeed! Passion it is that\r\nthrills in every page of that admirable book of Merimee's, La Chronique\r\nde Charles IX., which has given birth in succession to those two\r\nmasterpieces, Le Pre aux Clercs and Les Huguenots. And what indeed\r\nwould life be without passion? If Fieschi's crime marked the year 1835\r\nwith a crimson letter, 1836 was the year of Alibaud's attempt. The\r\nhistory of my father's reign is nothing but an innumerable succession\r\nof such attempts, some of which came to the birth, while others, again,\r\nmiscarried. Alibaud, as my readers are aware, fired point-blank at the\r\nKing with a walking-stick gun, which he steadied on the door of the\r\ncarriage, as it passed slowly through the Tuileries archway, and missed\r\nhim, except that his whiskers were singed by the wad. Neither my\r\nfather's courage nor that of my mother and aunt, who were with him,\r\nfailed them for a moment. I saw them get out of the carriage at\r\nNeuilly, without for an instant suspecting the risk they had run.\r\n\r\nBut the time soon came for me to go to sea again, and I was ordered to\r\njoin the frigate Iphigenie, of which my old captain, M. de Parseval,\r\nhad taken command, as full lieutenant, and we started for the Levant\r\nstation. The recollection of a very extraordinary accident which\r\noccurred during this cruise remains with me. We were in the\r\nArchipelago, off the Island of Andros. I had just come off the first\r\nnight watch, at midnight, and had got into bed, when I heard somebody\r\nsay our consort, a twenty-gun brig, the Ducouedic, Commander Bruat, was\r\nmaking signals of distress, I got back on deck without delay. The\r\nbrig's lights had disappeared. Nothing could be seen of her. It was\r\nblowing great guns, with a heavy sea. We continued in a state of great\r\nanxiety till morning. At last, by the first rays of daylight, we saw\r\nour consort dismasted. She signalled to us for a tow, which was quite\r\nimpracticable in the state of the sea. All we could do was to stand by\r\nher, while she tried to get to Syra with her foresail, the only one\r\nleft her. This she succeeded in doing. But the extraordinary thing is\r\nthat what dismasted her was the contrary action of a tremendous roll,\r\nand a heavy squall, which came just at midnight, when the whole crew\r\nwas mustered on deck, to change the watch, and that the mainmast with\r\nall its spars and gear and the maintopmast as well, fell on to the deck\r\nwithout hurting anybody.\r\n\r\nExcept for this one accident, all the interest of this fresh cruise of\r\nmine lay on the side of the picturesque. Greece with her mythological,\r\npoetic, and historical memories, and the great severe outlines of her\r\nlandscapes, struck me with admiration. But this was quickly\r\novershadowed by the impression made upon me by my first glimpse of\r\nAsia--the Mussulman East, which Lamartine's Voyage and Decamps'\r\npictures had made me long so eagerly to know. My joy, therefore, may be\r\nconceived, when I saw, as I landed at Smyrna, the living image of\r\nDecamps' masterpiece, La Patrouille de Smyrne, now at Rotterdam,\r\npassing by me--the very same police officer trotting along on his\r\nhunched-up Turcoman horse, surrounded by his policemen, regular\r\nbandits, running beside him, covered with brilliant rags and glistening\r\nweapons. This worthy police agent, whose name was Hadgy-Bey (which we\r\npromptly turned into \"Quat'Gibets\"), very soon became our ally. I did\r\nhis likeness. He was all smiles whenever we met, and he winked at all\r\nour young midshipmen's pranks One they played was rather too strong,\r\nand roused the fury of the Turks. Smyrna was at that time the most\r\nEastern of Eastern towns, full of tortuous bazaars, and narrow alleys\r\nwinding in and out, in which circulation, difficult enough at all\r\ntimes, sometimes became impossible for hours, when long strings of\r\ncamels, fastened together with ropes, were going along them. Nothing\r\ncould have been more vexatious than these blocks, which man and beast\r\nalike seemed to take pleasure in prolonging, whenever the Giaours\r\nseemed annoyed by them.\r\n\r\nWhat, think you, did our middies do? A great many of them together (for\r\nwe had a very strong naval squadron at Smyrna just then) hired donkeys,\r\ntied them together with long cords, mounted them, each rider with a\r\nlong pipe in his mouth and affecting a quiet Eastern gravity of\r\ndemeanour, and off they started.\r\n\r\nThis farandole, which was quite a kilometre long, went round and round\r\nthe bazaars all day, up and down and in and out, stopping all the\r\ntraffic, as if a real caravan was passing' through. At first the \"true\r\nbelievers\" were puzzled, but when they realized they were being laughed\r\nat they grew furious, and rushed off to get \"Quat'Gibets,\" who held his\r\nfat sides and roared with laughter when they told him what was amiss.\r\nOur midshipmen gave him a regular ovation. We were avenged on camels\r\nand camel men alike. The neighbourhood of Smyrna was delightful, and\r\nbrigandage quite unknown. Civilization had not yet taught that\r\nrefinement of the art, as practised nowadays, whereby people are\r\ncarried off and called upon to get themselves ransomed, on pain of\r\nhaving their noses or ears, or finally their heads, cut off. It was\r\nquite safe to go anywhere, to canter far along the road to Magnesia, or\r\nto stop and take coffee beside some cool spring in the shadow of the\r\nhuge plane-trees, and watch the whole East pass by--caravans from\r\nDiarbekir, half-wild Turcoman tribes, bashi-bazouks from the four\r\ncorners of Asia, all of them worthy subjects for an artist's pencil,\r\nand I never stopped drawing them. Coming back to the town, which had\r\nbeen cooled by the sea-breeze, the \"Imbat,\" we used to spend our\r\nevenings in the Levantine or Armenian society of the place, amongst\r\ngrandfathers who were still faithful to their old costume, wrapped in\r\nkaftans, and charming young ladies, with Tacticos on their heads, and\r\ntheir beautiful figures, which no stays had ever tortured, draped in\r\nhalf-oriental costumes. Native music, soft and plaintive, sounded, as\r\nwe would watch Mademoiselles Peiser, Athanaso, Fonton, Tricon, &c.,\r\ndance the Romaika. Nothing exists, nowadays, of what was so seductive\r\nthen. The Orient has kept its sunshine and its colouring, but that\r\nhorrible cosmopolitanism has invaded everything. Everywhere there are\r\nstays! and stays steal charm away!\r\n\r\nWe were young and gay at the time I speak of, and passionate too! Two\r\nof my brother lieutenants fought a duel, much more serious than those\r\npin-prick encounters which are now the fashion. They fought with\r\npistols, on the very marine promenade where they had been joking with\r\nyoung ladies the evening before. Just as the seconds gave the signal to\r\nfire, the sun rose on the horizon. Its first ray glinted on a breast\r\nbutton on the uniform of one principal: the other man's bullet, as\r\nthough drawn by some fatal attraction, struck the button, and killed\r\nour unhappy comrade dead. A midshipman carried off a charming Greek\r\nlady, who was discovered in his cabin after his ship had got out to\r\nsea. And many another strange incident occurred! On leaving Smyrna, the\r\nIphigenie cruised all about the Archipelago, and along the Anatolian,\r\nCaramanian, and Syrian coasts. Whenever I was not on duty my pencil was\r\nin my fingers, for I had the most enchanting and picturesque of models\r\nunder my hand. From Tripoli in Syria I climbed to the top of Mount\r\nLebanon, whence I saw an immense panorama, with the ruins of Baalbec\r\nand the Desert. We picnicked with the patriarch of the Lebanon and his\r\nmonks, under the world-famed cedars, and Bruat had a perfect duel of\r\njokes there with a witty ship's surgeon named Camescasse, who was one\r\nof our party. I remember a funny saying of this same Camescasse, about\r\na brother medico of his who retired into Brittany, where his practice\r\nwas specially among the local aristocracy. He always called him \"The\r\nAvenger of the People.\"\r\n\r\nAt Eden, the chief town of the Maronites, the old shiek Boutrouss-Karam\r\nreceived me with the greatest honours, and I was half drowned with\r\nsprinklings of rose-water, the smell of which I detest. Apart from my\r\npresence, there was a great fete going on at Eden for the marriage of\r\nBoutrouss-Karam's daughter, and the whole Maronitenation had hurried to\r\nit in their best clothes. Such handsome types, such costumes, such\r\nturbans! I was one of the bride's witnesses: she and I had each to keep\r\na bracelet balanced on our heads during the whole of the ceremony. The\r\nbride shook, and her bracelet fell down. After the ceremony she\r\nreceived me unveiled. She was a fine tall dark girl, but not a pretty\r\nwoman. From Jaffa I journeyed to Jerusalem, and travelled all through\r\nthe Holy Land, with a feeling of deep emotion, which was only disturbed\r\nby one vexatious incident. On the day I was to go to the Church of the\r\nHoly Sepulchre, a great crowd had got there before me, and a quarrel,\r\nwhich degenerated into a general melee, forthwith arose between Greeks,\r\nJews, and Armenians. It was only by dint of hard knocks that the\r\nTurkish police made way for me to enter the Holy Place, and to crown\r\nthe scandal, just as I knelt in deep devotion, before the altar, the\r\norgan began to play the Marseillaise. There was yet another episode\r\nduring my stay at Jerusalem. The Governor of the Province waited upon\r\nme to say he had Mehemet Ali's orders to place himself at the disposal\r\nof the son of the King of France, and to do whatever he desired. I\r\ncaught the ball on the hop, and replied he was just in time, for I had\r\njust been going to ask his leave to enter the Mosque of Omar, which\r\nstands on the site of the ancient Temple of Solomon. It should be added\r\nthat this fine mosque, which is next in holiness in Mussulman eyes to\r\nthat at Mecca, and which is now open to all the world, had at that date\r\nnever been seen except by the famous traveller Ali Bey.\r\n\r\nGovernor Hassan Bey tugged his beard when he heard my request, and\r\nseemed very much put out indeed. After a moment's silence he made up\r\nhis mind, and said, \"Come to-morrow: I'll take you there myself.\" The\r\nnext day I kept my appointment, bringing Bruat and two or three\r\nofficers who were making the same trip with me. We entered the mosque,\r\nwhich is really very beautiful, and went all over it. The Imaums and\r\nSoftas, the priests and students, had cast horrified glances upon us\r\nfrom the moment of our entry. Suddenly one of them began to intone in a\r\nfalsetto voice a sort of Litany, to which the crowd replied in chorus.\r\nSoon the Litany turned into angry shouts, and the crowd, led by an old\r\nNegro Imaum, in a yellow robe, who seemed to have worked himself into a\r\nperfect paroxysm of fury, rushed at us with threatening gestures. This\r\nwas by no means reassuring, but Hassan Bey was equal to the emergency.\r\nSeizing me by the arm, he put me behind him, with Bruat and the other\r\ngentlemen grouped round me. Then he ordered a dozen Kavasses he had\r\nbrought with him to charge, which they did, laying out heavily with\r\ntheir sticks. Not content with that, he had the most turbulent of the\r\nSoftas seized, thrown down at his feet, and beaten without mercy. The\r\nblows hailed down on the poor wretch as if they had been beating a\r\ncarpet. This determined attitude cowed the crowd, which fell back to\r\nthe far end of the mosque, grumbling. \"We will go now,\" said the Bey.\r\nOnce we were outside, he shut us up in a neighbouring mosque, which was\r\nempty, begging us to wait there for him. Soon we heard a great noise\r\nand yelling outside. Presently Hassan Bey reappeared smiling, and let\r\nus out. The crowd had disappeared, and a battalion of Egyptian infantry\r\nhad taken its place. Advised by the Bey, we left Jerusalem a day after\r\nthis scuffle, with much regret on my part. The sight of all the spots\r\nwhich are glorified by the splendid stories of our religious history\r\nhad impressed me deeply. My imagination had conjured up the very\r\npictures in Royaumont's illustrated Bible, out of which I had learnt\r\nboth the Old and the New Testament. And just as I was about to start,\r\nwhen I opened the window of the room I occupied in the Latin convent, I\r\nsaw just in front of me the picture in that same Bible which represents\r\nDavid, with hands uplifted in admiration, as he gazes at Bathsheba, the\r\nwife of Uriah the Hittite. I was the David, and Bathsheba was a woman,\r\nlooking really magnificent in her eastern robes, who was sitting on the\r\nterrace facing me. Only she was not combing out her hair like the woman\r\nin the Bible picture: she was hunting it for vermin!\r\n\r\nI returned from Jerusalem by the Dead Sea, Nazareth, and Acre.\r\n\r\nAs we were riding along one night, to escape the heat, not far from\r\nNazareth, we met a troop of horsemen headed by an individual in\r\nEgyptian dress, who announced himself as Ibrahim Aga, sent by Soliman\r\nPasha to meet me. Just as I was calling up the dragoman to translate\r\nwhat I had to say to him, Ibrahim Aga said to me in a drawling voice,\r\n\"Don't give yourself that trouble, it isn't the least necessary. I am\r\nthe Marquis de Beaufort, captain on the staff.\" He was in fact one of\r\nthe very many French officers, who were detached to the Egyptian army\r\nthen lying in cantonments in Syria, after its victories over the Turks\r\nat Homs and Konieh. I had seen and greatly admired these troops all\r\nover Syria and at Acre. I was soon to see Soliman Pasha--in other\r\nwords, Colonel Selves, a Frenchman, who had organized them, and under\r\nthe energetic and iron-willed son of Mehemet Ali, Ibrahim Pasha, had\r\nled them to victory. I beheld a little man, whom long residence in\r\nEgypt had quite orientalized in appearance but who had preserved all\r\nthe vivacity of his Gallic wit. The Iphigenie returned to France by\r\nMalta, where I made the acquaintance of Lord Brudenell, since\r\ncelebrated under the name of Lord Cardigan, for his famous Balaclava\r\ncharge and of Major Rose, a charming fellow, who later became the Sir\r\nHugh Rose of the Crimean War, and after that Field-Marshal Lord\r\nStrathnairn of the Indian Mutiny. At that moment Major Rose commanded\r\nthe 42nd Highlanders, the famous \"Black Watch,\" a splendid regiment,\r\nespecially so then, when it consisted of nothing but veterans of\r\nHerculean build. It furnished the Guard of Honour that received me at\r\nthe Palace of the Grand Masters when I went to pay my respects to the\r\ngovernor, and the salute of that splendid body of men in full-dress\r\nuniform and feathered bonnets, with their colours lowered to the\r\nground, their band playing God save the Queen, and their bagpipes\r\nshrieking under the arches of the palace, was a most striking sight.\r\nThat was the first time I heard the bagpipes of the Highland regiments.\r\nI have often heard them since, and they always remind me of that\r\nwonderfully dramatic incident in the great Indian Mutiny, the relief of\r\nLucknow. In Lucknow, the capital of the kingdom of Oude, a handful of\r\nBritish soldiers, with the women and children who had escaped the\r\nmassacre, had taken refuge in a huge and strongly built place called\r\nthe Residency. Isolated in the heart of India, besieged for months on\r\nend, without any outside news, starving, decimated by sickness and the\r\nenemy's fire, women and soldiers alike, with true British pluck, and\r\nhaving lost all hope of succour, had no thought but to sell their lives\r\nas dearly as possible. All at once the noise of the daily cannonade and\r\nthe rifle fire seem to be doubled, and unaccustomed shouts are heard,\r\nlike the national \"hurrah.\" The cheering seems to get nearer, but the\r\nSepoys have so often cheered derisively! Suddenly another sound strikes\r\non the ear of the besieged. The bagpipes! The bagpipes! And soon they\r\nmake out the famous Highland march, The Campbells are coming!\r\nReinforcements they were, collected from all quarters, English and\r\nScotch, soldiers and sailors too, commanded by old Lord Clyde of\r\nBalaclava fame. By main force they carried the works the mutineers,\r\ntenfold their strength, had thrown up round Lucknow, bringing\r\nunhoped-for succour from the mother country, nay, bringing actual\r\nsalvation with them. A wonderful moment!\r\n\r\nI got back to Paris to hear the news of the failure of the first\r\nexpedition against Constantine, and the brilliant part my brother\r\nNemours had played in that terrible business. I never doubted that\r\nsignal revenge would soon be taken for the check, and I was in despair\r\nthat my being a sailor stood in the way of my asking to be allowed to\r\nhave a share in it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I was present at a fresh attempt on my father's life. A man\r\nof the name of Meunier fired a pistol at him the day the Chamber of\r\nDeputies was opened. Some movement in the crowd shook the would-be\r\nassassin's arm, but the bullet came into the carriage, smashing the\r\nfront window, and my brothers and I were all cut with the broken glass.\r\nI remember a very characteristic remark by one of the Deputies on this\r\noccasion. After the King had departed, as the Members of the Chamber\r\nwere talking over the attempt, one of them said, \"Ought we to\r\ncongratulate the King?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" was the reply; \"we always do it.\"\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards an emulator of Fieschi invented a perfected machine\r\nwhich should have mowed us all down at the earliest opportunity, but he\r\nwas discovered, and destroyed himself, just as he was going to be\r\narrested, carrying the secret of his accomplices with him.\r\n\r\nAmidst political agitation and ministerial ambitions, with which I\r\ntroubled myself but very little, the marriage of my eldest brother, the\r\nDuc d'Orleans, and its attendant festivities, took place. The wedding\r\nwas at Fontainebleau; there was a great fete at the Hotel de Ville in\r\nParis, and the formal inauguration of the Museum at Versailles.\r\n\r\nThe marriage was settled without my brother and Princess Helene ever\r\nhaving seen each other. Impatient to know her, and anxious to be the\r\nfirst to greet her on French soil, my brother went to meet her at\r\nNancy, where she was to arrive with her mother and a lady in waiting.\r\nHe rushed forward, saw three ladies, caught his fiancees hand and\r\ncarried it to his lips. Not at all! It was the lady-in-waiting's. This\r\nmomentary hitch was soon forgotten, and when the Princess entered the\r\nCour du Cheval-Blanc at Fontainebleau, in her state coach and eight,\r\namidst the roar of cannon and the beating of drums, we all went down\r\nthe great staircase to receive her, with the King at our head, just\r\nlike the great lords going down the staircase at Chenonceaux in the\r\nsecond act of the Huguenots. It was Champs-Elysees, and through the\r\nGardens to the Tuileries, we on horseback and the Princesses in the\r\nstate carriages, with the Orleans state liveries, surrounded by an\r\nimmense multitude of people, all the women in brilliant spring\r\ntoilettes, and in the loveliest weather, was a splendid sight too. Then\r\nthere was a very fine ball at the Hotel de Ville--rather clouded,\r\nthough, by a prediction coming from all quarters, that it would be the\r\noccasion of another attempt on my father.\r\n\r\nOld Prince Talleyrand, who was almost dying, begged my eldest brother\r\nto go and see him, so that he might add his warning to all the others.\r\nRaising himself to a sitting posture, and with death in his face, he\r\nsaid: \"It won't be a knife or a pistol, it will be a hail of\r\npaving-stones thrown from the roofs, which will crush you all!\" We were\r\ngrateful for the warning, and we were glad it did not come to pass.\r\nNothing happened, either in the street or at the ball, where we were\r\nsurrounded by an army of chosen 'guests,' and from which we were driven\r\nback at a great pace, escorted by squadrons of cuirassiers, who\r\nglittered in the torchlight. But the crowning point of the fetes was\r\nthe inauguration of the Versailles Museum, that museum and dedicated by\r\nmy father \"To all the Glories of France!\" Others besides himself have\r\ngiven the sadness of irony to that inscription! Every revolution must\r\nbe paid for with a price!\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of this inauguration the King gave a dinner to twelve\r\nhundred people in the galleries of the Palace. Each of us had to\r\npreside over a table, and I should have found mine a somewhat tiresome\r\ntask, if among my guests I had not met some very clever men, whose\r\nconversation amused me much. Such were Alphonse Karr, Leon Gozlan,\r\nNestor Roqueplan, &c.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner there was a theatrical performance--the Misanthrope, given\r\nfor the first time with Louis XIV. dresses, acted by Perrier, Provost,\r\nSamson, Firmin, Menjaud, Monrose, and Regnier, with Mmes. Mars, Plessy,\r\nand Mante; and then one act of Robert le Diable, with Duprez,\r\nLevasseur, and Mile. Falcon--and the ballet.\r\n\r\nAfter the performance there was a general promenade in the galleries,\r\nwhich were lighted up brilliantly. I lay claim to two good ideas, which\r\ncame to me during the evening. The first was to plague the King and the\r\nministers to such an extent, after the act out of Robert le Diable,\r\nthat Meyerbeer, whom I fetched, was then and there nominated an officer\r\nof the Legion of Honour, a commonplace distinction enough nowadays, but\r\nwhich at that time was very exceptional. The second was to ask the\r\nKing, also, if he would graciously permit the artists who had taken\r\npart in the performance to join the guests in the promenade in the\r\ngalleries. Of this permission I was myself the bearer, and I naturally\r\nextended it to the corps de ballet. When all these young ladies in\r\ntheir morning dress, and many of them bandbox in hand, appeared walking\r\nabout amongst the gaily bedizened folk, some of the fine ladies turned\r\nup their noses. But the medley was a charming one, nevertheless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n1837-1838\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the wedding festivities I went back to sea, a lieutenant still,\r\non board the Hercule, 100 guns--Captain Casy. Captain, petty officers,\r\ncrew, all hands in fact save a few officers, were Provencal. Before a\r\nweek was out I caught myself talking with their accent!\r\n\r\nWe were bound for South America Gibraltar was our first port, and our\r\nreception by the governor, Sir Alexander Woodford, Lady Woodford, and\r\ntheir charming children was of the kindest. I have a recollection of it\r\nwhich I treasure all the more in that later in the day I had to do with\r\nanother governor with whom I had no cause at all to be satisfied. From\r\nGibraltar we went to Tangier, the Moorish town I was to bombard some\r\nyears afterwards, but where on this occasion I fought with wild boars\r\nonly under the guidance of that first-class sportsman, Mr. Drummond\r\nHay. The beauty of the eyes and colouring and the originality of the\r\ncostume of the Jewish girls at Tangier delighted me, but not to the\r\nextent of chasing a certain melancholy from my heart, which had clung\r\nabout it ever since the beginning of my cruise, through the long night\r\nwatches, and even amidst the amusements of our stays in port. I was\r\nthinking of HER! There always is a HER when one is only twenty! After\r\nTangier the ship stopped at Santa Cruz in Teneriffe, to take in water,\r\nand during this operation I organized a scientific expedition to the\r\nfamous Peak of Teneriffe, which is nearly twelve thousand feet high,\r\nand from which my professor M. Pouillet had asked me to take some\r\nscientific observations. My brother officer, Rigaud de Genouilly, one\r\nof the ship's lieutenants, accompanied me. After two days climbing and\r\nbivouacking for one night at a great height, we were only about five or\r\nsix hundred feet or so from the summit, when we were caught up by a\r\nmessenger bringing us the captain's orders to get back as fast as we\r\ncould. A despatch boat had just anchored at Santa Cruz bringing news\r\nthat in consequence of some foreign complication a French squadron had\r\nbeen ordered to Tunis, and would probably go on to the East. The\r\nHercule was to join it immediately. We tore down the mountain,\r\nrejoicing in the thought that we were most likely going to do some\r\nfiring, and after a passage of twenty days, spent in all sorts of\r\nfighting drill, we cast anchor in the Bay of Tunis, only to have a\r\nbucket of cold water thrown over our heads. The complications on which\r\nwe had built a whole structure of danger and glory had passed away. The\r\nsquadron we were to have joined had departed, and orders awaited us to\r\nresume our interrupted cruise, and bear away for South America. One\r\npiece of news was we were told was that the expedition which was to go\r\nand avenge our last year's defeat at Constantine was fitting out at\r\nBona, and that my brother Nemours commanded one of the brigades. Now my\r\nbig ship was to revictual at Algiers, and I besought the captain, who\r\nhad a free hand, to touch at Bona and give me a chance of seeing my\r\nbrother. The passage from Tunis to Bona was delayed by calms, and when\r\nwe got in, I found to my great regret that the expedition had started,\r\nbut that a small column was being formed which was to join it, starting\r\non the following morning. At this news I rushed to my captain, and\r\ncalling all the resources of persuasion and every wile of diplomacy to\r\nmy aid, I strove to convince him that there would be time for me,\r\nduring his revictualling, whereat I should be practically useless, to\r\nmake a rush to the expeditionary force and get back again, and that if\r\nthe King, my father, knew I had happened to be where I was, he would be\r\nmuch displeased at my turning my back on an enterprise which was to\r\navenge our national honour. There were no telegraph wires in those\r\ndays, and I contrived to get the desired permission. Twenty-four hours\r\nlater I turned soldier for the nonce, and started off, mounted and\r\naccoutred and full of fresh dreams of glory, destined once more to\r\ndisappointment--a disappointment shared by various engineer and\r\nartillery officers and three Prussians, Messieurs von Willisen,\r\n[Footnote: H. de Willisen, aide-de-camp to the Prince of Prussia, who\r\nafterwards became the Emperor William, was in chief command of the\r\nHolstein army.] von Noville, and Oelrichs, who had arrived too late to\r\nstart with the expeditionary force, and, like myself, were endeavouring\r\nto rejoin it. What shall I say about the march of the column to which I\r\nwas attached upon Constantine? It lasted over twelve days of fearful\r\nweather, during which no discomfort was spared us. Torrents of rain,\r\nrivers in flood, snowfalls, men dying of cold, stragglers whose shouts\r\nfor help only brought us to them to find them lying headless on the\r\nground, and last of all, a terrible outbreak of cholera, which one of\r\nthe regiments in the column brought with it from France. And we had the\r\nmental agony to boot of being kept ever so long at the foot of a\r\nmountain, the Raz el Akbah, which was so sodden that no gun nor vehicle\r\ncould get up it, even with triple teams, and listening to the firing of\r\nthe attacking batteries before Constantine without being able to get\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nOne day, during this delay, the chief medical officer, by way of\r\nconsolation, greeted us with these words at breakfast: \"Bad news,\r\ngentlemen; we have just discovered that the cesspools of the hospital\r\n(a miserable hut) have burst, and for the last twenty-four hours they\r\nhave been leaking into the spring where we get our drinking water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hang it all, doctor, you really might have kept that to yourself,\" we\r\nall cried in a breath!\r\n\r\nAmid all this suffering and discomfort, physical and moral, the\r\ncourage, spirits, good humour and downright gaiety of the soldiers\r\nnever failed for a single moment. I had never seen them before under\r\nsuch trying circumstances, and I thought them quite admirable, and\r\ntheir officers too,--the very embodiment of devotion. One day, the rear\r\nguard detachment had dropped some way behind the main column, and found\r\nitself stopped by an impetuous torrent, which was swelling visibly\r\nunder a deluge of rain. The first men who tried to cross were carried\r\noff their feet, thrown down, and only pulled out with great difficulty.\r\nWithout a moment's hesitation all the officers plunged into the water,\r\nthough it was up to their arm-pits, and holding on to each other's arms\r\nthey formed a sort of animated dam, above which they made their men\r\ncross over, and it was all done in the simplest way. Frenchmen of all\r\nclasses, soldiers, sailors, what-not, a splendid race they are, when\r\nthe spirit of obedience and discipline inspires them with a sense of\r\nduty! At last we came in sight of Constantine, and shortly after of a\r\nbody of cavalry, the Third Chasseurs d'Afrique, sent out to meet us.\r\nFrom an officer detached in advance we learnt the place had been taken\r\nby assault three days previously, and that the Comte de Damremont,\r\ngeneral in command, had been cut in two by a round shot, while he was\r\ntalking to my brother Nemours. Very soon, galloping up to the\r\nCoudiat-Ati, I was in the arms of that good brother, who had behaved so\r\nbrilliantly during the whole campaign. He was in the act of inspecting\r\nhis brave little army, and we finished the inspection together. Then he\r\nscanned me from top to toe, and the smart soldier spoke instead of the\r\nbrother \"You can't go about like that, haven't you anything else to put\r\non?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I haven't,\" I sadly replied, with a humiliated glance at my\r\nshort jacket, my trousers turned up with a bit of gutta percha, and my\r\nstraw hat covered with waxed cloth, none of which had been improved by\r\ncamping out in the mud. The only soldier-like things about me were my\r\nsword and my lieutenant's epaulettes. But they manufactured me a cap, a\r\nnaval lieutenant, Fabre Lamaurelle, who had come up with me, lent me\r\nhis coat, and so I became presentable.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the breach excited me greatly, and my first care was to\r\nmount it. If my readers will call up the appearance of the buildings\r\npulled down when a new street is opened in Paris, they will get some\r\nidea of the picture the top of the breach presented. It was a chaos of\r\nruins, caused by cannon shot and explosions, without any apparent way\r\nout. The ground was like the moraine of a glacier, scattered over with\r\ncaps, epaulettes, and human remains. A soldier of the 2nd Light\r\nInfantry was standing sentry beside a big stone.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you see that bit of a blue cloak down that hole? The colonel is\r\nunderneath that stone, and the bayonets sticking out of the rubbish\r\nbelong to the men he was leading. The explosion buried them all alive!\"\r\n\r\nA terrible trial that explosion was for assaulting columns scattered\r\nthrough a labyrinth of ruins, and barricaded lanes, and fired at from\r\nall sides by an invisible foe.\r\n\r\nBut nothing dismayed our brave fellows for an instant. I was told that\r\nat the moment of the catastrophe, when the staff, which was following\r\nthe progress of the fight with anxious ears, for there was no seeing\r\nanything, saw the cloud caused by the explosion shrouding the\r\nneighbourhood of the breach, and hundreds of wounded and burnt and\r\nmaimed men coming down it, they thought the assault had been repulsed\r\nand that the game was up.\r\n\r\nLamoriciere, commanding the first attacking column, was carried back\r\nblinded, and to everybody's astonishment the commanding officer of the\r\n2nd column, Colonel Combes, was seen returning also. He advanced, sword\r\nin hand, to the General commanding, over whose face an expression first\r\nof wonder and then of anger spread, at the sight of a commanding\r\nofficer quitting his post. Nothing daunted, the colonel informed him,\r\nin a few curt sentences, of the state of the fight, and of his own\r\nconfidence in its success, ending with these words: \"It will be another\r\nglorious day for France and for those who live to see the end of it.\"\r\nHe saluted, tottered--he was dead! No sign of his had betrayed that he\r\nwas mortally wounded.\r\n\r\nAs I listened to the tale I asked General Vallee,--\"But what would you\r\nhave done, General, if the assault had been repulsed?\"\r\n\r\n\"We should have begun again.\" As he said it he pressed his lips\r\ntogether with that fearfully stern expression which, with his short\r\nstature, had earned him the nickname in the army of \"Little Louis XI.,\"\r\nand an officer behind me who wad heard my question and the answer,\r\nadded in an undertone, \"And he had taken all his precautions.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"When he was told, the night before the assault, that the ammunition\r\nwas giving out, he ordered one round to be kept in reserve for the\r\nbattery that played upon the breach--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you understand? He meant to fire on the attacking column if it\r\ngave any sign of wavering. He did it once in Spain at the siege of\r\nTarragona.\"\r\n\r\nThere was another scene of war at the opposite end of the town from the\r\nbreach at the Kasbah. During the assault all the non-combatant\r\nMussulman population had taken refuge there, crowding and cramming it\r\nup to the very edge of the ramparts that crowned the precipices of the\r\nRummel, and either from sheer terror or by dint of the pressure of the\r\ncrowd, a cascade of human beings fell from the ramparts on to the rocks\r\nand terraces of the precipice. Heaps of corpses, men, women and\r\nchildren, but especially women, were caught here and there, and on one\r\nof the heaps an old white-bearded Arab was turning over the dead, one\r\nby one, seeking doubtless for some one who was dear to him.\r\n\r\nHaving no official position in the army, and as I could not well rest\r\non laurels I had not won, I spent my time sketching. I began, of\r\ncourse, with the breach, and installed myself, for that purpose, beside\r\na human head severed from the trunk, which lay on the ground alongside\r\nof a dead horse in the torn open belly of which a dog had made its\r\nlair. While I was drawing, I heard a bugle sounding a march and soon I\r\nsaw the bugler coming out. Upon the breach; behind him marched a\r\nsub-lieutenant, sword in hand, and then in place of men, a string of\r\ndonkeys, led by about a dozen Zouave irregulars. Puzzled, I went up to\r\nthe bugler and, stopping him, I asked what he was blowing for. \"Why,\"\r\nhe replied rocking from one foot to another with his bugle on his hip,\r\n\"this is the volunteer company from Bougie going back to headquarters.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those are the rifles on the donkeys, there--everybody killed in the\r\nassault; there is nobody left but us.\" He began blowing again. The\r\ndonkeys passed on and I bared my head to them.\r\n\r\nConfident in the impregnability of his town, the Bey of Constantine had\r\nleft his harem there and the ladies of it were shut up in the palace,\r\nwhich had been turned into head-quarters, and where I was living with\r\nNemours. As may be imagined, this harem gave me subjects for many\r\nsketches, which disappeared, unluckily for me, in the sacking of the\r\nTuileries on February 24th, 1848. In one of the courtyards, planted\r\nwith orange-trees and roses, and surrounded by the elegant Moorish\r\nbalconies of the Bey's Palace, there was a little door, which had been\r\nconfided to the care of the vivandiere of the 47th Regiment and of a\r\nsergeant major of spahis, of the name of Bel-Kassem. It was the door\r\ninto the harem and gave access to several courts, surrounded by\r\ngalleries, both on the ground floor and first story, on which opened\r\nspacious rooms carpeted with divans and cushions and with shelves all\r\nround piled with quantities of things, knick-knacks, and, above all,\r\nstuffs, especially silken ones. The women--there were over two hundred\r\nof them--spent their lives night and day alike, squatting or lying on\r\nthe cushions in these apartments. They were divided into two\r\ncategories. The negresses, who formed the great majority, occupied two\r\ncourt-yards, and these courts exhaled a fetid odour which poisoned the\r\nwhole of the Bey's palace, whenever the wind blew from that quarter.\r\nThe white and sallow-complexioned women all lived together, they all\r\nwore Arab dress, with more or fewer trinkets, and there were some\r\npretty women among them. Two were Greeks and there was one really\r\nbeautiful Moorish woman, called Ayescha. I did her likeness, and that\r\nof the chief eunuch as well. He was a negro, growing grey, with a\r\ndeceitful hypocritical eye all muffled up in very fine haiks which\r\nshowed nothing but the tip of his nose, and legs which were entirely\r\nguiltless of calf. That sitting would have been a good subject for a\r\npicture--I drawing, the ladies of the harem hanging over me watching me\r\nwork, and the negro standing and swearing as he stood, while Ayescha\r\nwent to and fro lavishing the quaintest caresses on him, to keep him in\r\ngood temper.\r\n\r\nOne evening, General Vallee had an entertainment got up for him in the\r\nharem. There were great illuminations, singing, music with tambourine\r\naccompaniment and the danse du ventre. Amongst those present was\r\nGeneral de Caraman, who commanded the artillery. He was seized with\r\ncholera just as he was going away, and was dead by six o'clock the next\r\nmorning. Such is life! Several adventures arose out of the fact of the\r\nharem's presence. One fine night, when everybody was asleep, two of the\r\nofficers of infantry irregulars on guard took it into their heads to\r\nknock at the door, and were filled with delighted surprise on hearing\r\nthe gentle voice of the good-natured cantiniere reply, \"Is that you?\r\nWell upon my word,\" and the door opened. But within less than two\r\nminutes the frightful uproar caused by two hundred women shrieking at\r\nonce roused the whole of head-quarters, and our two officers tore full\r\npace back to the guardroom and got the men under arms. This scare, and\r\nit may be some others too, added to the pestiferous smell from the\r\nnegresses' quarters, made the authorities resolve to get rid of all\r\nthis human cattle and distribute it amongst the most well-to-do of the\r\nMussulman population. I went to look on at their departure, which was\r\npresided over by a major on the staff, assisted by a detachment of\r\nirregulars. The women had been warned the evening before, and leave had\r\nbeen given for each to take away as much as she herself could carry. So\r\nthey had spent the whole night rolling as many precious stuffs round\r\ntheir waists as they could support the weight of, and we found\r\nourselves face to face with human balloons, like monstrous gourds. They\r\ncould hardly walk, even when held up by the soldiers, and getting\r\nthrough the doorways was more difficult still. Some of them, hauled at\r\nin front and pushed from behind, shot through like the cork of a\r\nchampagne bottle. Others, who could not squeeze through at all, were\r\nmade over to the soldiers to be reduced to the necessary size, the\r\nwhole thing accompanied by a chorus of shouts and objurgations of every\r\nkind. But to pass from the harem to graver subjects. On October 18th, I\r\nwas present at the military funeral of the Comte Damremont. It was a\r\nmoving sight. Some few hundred yards from the spot where he had been\r\nkilled, just at the foot of the breach, a cenotaph had been built of\r\nsand-bags, on which the coffin, with his General's cloak, and his sword\r\nand white feathered hat laid on it, had been placed. The weather had\r\ngone into mourning too, for the occasion. It was a very gloomy day. The\r\nwhole Arab population was looking on, squatting on the walls. On the\r\ntop of the breach were planted the colours of the 47th Regiment. Below\r\nit the Zouaves' drums rolled a funeral march, while the officers did\r\nobeisance for the last time to the remains of their former general. And\r\nwhat officers they were too! How many future men of mark there were in\r\nthat assemblage, which, not to mention its chiefs, numbered Captains\r\nNiel, Canrobert, MacMahon, St. Arnault, Le Boeuf, Ladmirault, Morris,\r\nLeflo, and many another in its ranks!\r\n\r\nThe army left Constantine in two detachments. I returned with the\r\nsecond, which escorted the general in command, who had fallen sick, and\r\nan enormous convoy of fever patients and cripples of all sorts. It was\r\na dreary journey back, for the column was decimated by cholera, and the\r\nroad was strewed with corpses. Every minute soldiers were to be seen\r\ndropping their muskets and writhing in the most awful convulsions. My\r\nbrother, who commanded the rear-guard, spent his whole time having the\r\npoor wretches picked up and tied into mule litters. They were thence\r\ndrafted into the ambulance wagons, which were crowded already, and\r\nthere they died like flies. As soon as a man died, the other occupants\r\nof the wagon united their efforts and heaved him overboard. When the\r\nconvoy started every morning a row of corpses marked the spot the\r\nwagons had been on during the night. A detachment of engineers covered\r\nthem over with a little soil, but we had hardly moved off before the\r\nArabs swooped down from all directions and uncovered and stripped them.\r\n\r\nI was ill myself by the time the columns got to Bona--fever had me in\r\nits grip, but thanks to severe physicking I was almost my own man again\r\nby the time I rejoined my ship at Algiers. She went to sea almost at\r\nonce. I had a relapse at Senegal, but the ocean passage completely\r\ncured me, and I was quite in smooth water by the time we reached the\r\nSouth American coast. Rio de Janeiro was our first port. I need not\r\nenlarge on the magnificent view presented by the Bay of Rio, which has\r\nbeen so frequently described by travellers. It was during this stay in\r\nharbour that I first saw the young princess who was later to become the\r\nPrincess de Joinville, the devoted companion of my whole life. During\r\nthis stay, too, I made an expedition to Minas, the gold mine country, a\r\nlong journey on mule-back, through the magnificent monotony of the\r\nvirgin forest. One of the mines I went to see, called Gongo-Soco, was\r\nworked by the labour of four hundred slaves, and owned by an English\r\ncompany who made an enormous profit out of it. I went down it, and,\r\nunder the guidance of some Cornish miners, I had a try with a pick and\r\nsucceeded in getting out several nuggets as thick as my little finger.\r\nAs the vein was principally manganese, we were black all over when we\r\ncame out of the mine, but a body of negresses came at once to wash us.\r\nAnother expedition I made into the \"camp\" initiated me into a sort of\r\nsport which was new to me--hunting wild horses with a lasso. After\r\nhaving admired the extraordinary skill of the camperos in doing this, I\r\ntried it myself, and that not altogether unsuccessfully--it is a\r\nfascinating occupation.\r\n\r\nTo finish up our stay at Rio, we gave the emperor and his family, and\r\nthe whole of society both foreign and Brazilian, a ball on board our\r\nship. Towards the end of the evening, I turned a young lion I had been\r\ngiven in Senegal loose in the ball-room, and his appearance somewhat\r\ndisturbed the figures of the cotillon.\r\n\r\nFrom Rio the Hercule called in succession at Guiana, Martinique and\r\nGuadaloupe. The low shores of Guiana are clothed with mangrove swamps,\r\nthe trees of which seemed scarlet, so covered were they with red\r\nibises! Nothing more gay-looking can be imagined than the Cayenne\r\nRiver, and the pretty town standing on its banks--the wooden houses all\r\nseparated from each other by gardens in which the tropical vegetation\r\ndisplays an unexampled luxuriance and variety. Flowers of every hue,\r\nset among huge calabash trees, gigantic palms of every kind, such as\r\nthe traveller's palm with its immense fan-shaped leaves, bread-fruit\r\ntrees, and many more, charm the eye with a wealth of colour which must\r\nbe seen before it can be realized. Though the Cayenne River may be\r\ncharming, the other arms of the Guiana delta, great rivers, hedged in\r\nby thick dark forest walls, are far gloomier to the sight. But those\r\nmagnificent forests, peopled with creatures of all sorts, and\r\nespecially with an infinite number of birds, of the most varied and\r\ndazzling plumage, have the irresistible attraction that hangs about\r\nlife in the wilds.\r\n\r\nI went up several of these rivers, such as the Aprouague and the Mana\r\nRiver, and visited the carbets, or villages, of several Indian tribes,\r\nthe Norags, and the Galibis, which last were still quite savage at the\r\ntime of which I write, armed with bows and arrows, and obtaining a\r\nlight by rubbing two bits of stick together--a thing I actually saw\r\nthem do. Men and women alike were red-skinned, tartar-eyed, their\r\nsmooth hair dyed with \"rocou,\" a sort of madder, and with a small strip\r\nof cotton passed between the legs as their only garment. The women were\r\nparticularly frightful. Almost all of them had huge stomachs, which\r\nthey held up with their hands just like a monkey's pouch, and all wore\r\na kind of tight bracelet above and below their knees and ankles, which\r\ncaused the intervening parts to swell, and gave their legs the\r\nappearance of skewers with Dutch cheeses on them. Apart from the\r\nsavages, the general impression of Guiana remaining with me is that of\r\na great hot-house, in which everything was as improbably huge as in one\r\nof Gustave Dore's illustrations--where I came across apricots as big as\r\nmy head, and caimans ten yards long. As regards the inhabitants, I\r\nrecollect Creoles, enervated by the climate, who were as kindly as they\r\nwere intelligent; pale-faced women, languorous and seductive, with soft\r\nlow murmuring voices; and lastly, just as I passed through, a negro\r\ndrum-major of the National Guard, with a great big busby and a plume\r\nthat was a dream!\r\n\r\nMy recollection of Martinique and Guadaloupe bring them back to me as\r\nlovely green islands of volcanic outline. The former especially struck\r\nme as being exceedingly picturesque, its hills covered with\r\npleasant-looking habitations with the peaks of the Carbet veiled in the\r\ndark clouds brought by the trade winds, for background. I had to review\r\nthe troops on the Savana, the promenade of Fort Royal, but I confess I\r\ntook more interest in the costume of the beautiful quadroons, or\r\nquarterbred mulatto women, than in the review itself. This costume is\r\nworth describing. A brilliant-coloured bandanna, knotted round the head\r\nin the most fanciful manner, no stays of course, nothing but an\r\nembroidered chemise, showing a magnificent outline, and a\r\nbright-coloured skirt, yellow or rose-coloured, trained at the back,\r\nbut gathered up on one side, to show a beautiful bare leg. When I add\r\nthat these women often have a creamy white complexion which many a\r\nEuropean would envy, the proud exclamation of the old householder,\r\ndragged I know not why before a court of justice, will be appreciated.\r\nTo the Judge's question \"What is your profession?\" he replied \"My\r\nprofession! I keep up the supply of Mulattos!\" \"Je fais des mulatres!\"\r\nIt was in the days of the greatest prosperity of our beautiful Antilles\r\nthat the old boaster spoke. When I arrived, this was already on the\r\nwane, and it really was tiresome not to be allowed to talk about\r\nanything but sugar and emancipation by the Creoles.\r\n\r\nNowadays what we call progress has done its work, and these colonies,\r\nwhich used to be an element of national wealth, employing a whole navy\r\nof merchantmen, and which served as nursery for the sailors of our\r\nwarships, are now no more than machines for electing Radical Deputies,\r\nand thus increasing the number of agents of the national destruction.\r\n\r\nAt Martinique, we joined the flag of the admiral in command of the\r\nstation. I have served under many admirals, one more eccentric than the\r\nother. One of the first, an excellent seaman, had one passion only,\r\nmusic--and his instrument was the double bass. He spent his time\r\nperforming solos on this cumbrous instrument, which he would then put\r\naway in a small apartment known in the old-fashioned navy as la\r\nbouteille. Sometimes the sea-water came through the port, and flooded\r\neverything. When the admiral fetched his double bass out, and began his\r\ntunes, he would notice from the sound that the body was full of water,\r\nand then every sort of dodge would be resorted to, to get the liquid\r\npoured out by the sound holes. The poor admiral! There is a story that\r\nhis double bass was victim one day of the spite of certain seamen, who\r\nmarked their displeasure by pouring something less clean than sea-water\r\ninto the big fiddle. This same gallant admiral having gone ashore once\r\nupon a time, at St. Louis in Senegal, and finding the bar there\r\ncontinued so impassable that he could not rejoin his ship, sent her\r\nround to Goree, and went there himself overland slung under a camel's\r\nbelly, and armed with an umbrella,--which proved his complete ignorance\r\nof the miracles of the Prophet Mohammed.\r\n\r\nMy commanding officer at the time of which I write was another oddity.\r\nImagine a thin little man, as hot as pepper, adorned with a hooked nose\r\nand chin, one as huge as the other. A real old-fashioned gentleman,\r\nalways tightly buttoned up in the most irreproachably correct of\r\ngarments, and with all the exquisite and formal politeness of the old\r\nschool. Everybody was fond of the good old fellow, who heightened the\r\noddity of his appearance on board his own ship by wearing a huge straw\r\nhat like the bell-crowned hat Eugene Sue puts on the head of M. Pipelet\r\nin the Mysteres de Paris, and a song had been composed about him, which\r\nwe used to sing together and the chorus of which began \"Bon! bon! de la\r\nBretonniere! Bon Bon!\"--la Bretonniere being his name. This same\r\nofficer saved Admiral Magon's ship after Trafalgar, and later on he\r\ncommanded the Breslaw at Navarino and showed the most consummate\r\nbravery there. His flagship was the Didon, which ship, having run\r\naground several times, had earned the nickname of \"Dido the touching\"\r\n(la touchante Didon). Poor old Didon! I had sailed with her before and\r\nthe sight of her gave me the same feeling of grateful recollection that\r\nstirs within a man who meets an old love. After a short cruise with the\r\nwhole squadron the admiral led the way to the British island of Jamaica.\r\n\r\n*******\r\n\r\nWe had hardly cast anchor before he sent to ask the British Governor\r\nwhen he would receive him, and, the appointment duly made, he sent for\r\nme to go with him. An aide-de-camp received us at the landing-stage,\r\nsilently pointed to the governor's carriage, which awaited us, and\r\ndisappeared. The carriage in question was a phaeton with room for two\r\npeople in it, and a little seat behind for the groom, who was standing\r\nat the horses' heads with true British correctness. Says the admiral to\r\nme, \"Are we to go in that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" and he took two steps to the rear, \"there isn't any coachman.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are to drive yourself, sir.\"\r\n\r\nWith a half turn to the right he replied, \"I! Impossible! I've never\r\nbeen able to get a horse to go in my life. Do you know how to drive?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then take the reins, sir!\"\r\n\r\nInto the carriage then we got, to the great satisfaction of the groom,\r\nwho had guessed rather than understood the misgivings of the French\r\nadmiral in the cocked hat. At first, things went pretty well. The groom\r\nshowed me the way to Spanish Town, saying \"left\" or \"right\" as the case\r\nmight be, when, presently we came to a great market crowded with\r\nnegresses with blue cotton stuffs twisted round their haunches, all\r\nscreaming at the top of their voices. The horses in our phaeton took\r\nfright at the noise, their alarm communicated itself to the negresses,\r\nwho ran away, upsetting everything. I lost command of the horses, which\r\nswerved to one side, knocking over the heaps of gourds and water melons\r\nand bananas. There was a terrible scene of confusion. The admiral clung\r\non with both hands, never stopping shouting \"Oh the devil! the devil!\r\nthe devil!\" However we got through without any serious accident. On the\r\nreturn journey, conscious of my own incapacity, I offered to give up my\r\nplace as whip to the admiral, but he refused with a most determined\r\n\"No, no, no; oh NO!\"\r\n\r\nAt the time of my visit, Jamaica was still celebrated for its rum, and\r\nmy father had charged me not to forget to bring him a barrel, a\r\ncommission I did not fail to execute. But a lamentable accident\r\nhappened in connection with that same barrel. It was brought back to\r\nFrance and duly placed in the cellars at Neuilly, and had been\r\nforgotten for ever so long, when one fine day the King, recollecting\r\nit, ordered some of the contents to be handed round at the end of\r\ndinner. All the guests smacked their lips before-hand; but\r\ndisappointment awaited them, and the first taste was followed by a\r\ngeneral grimace of horror. It was simply beastly. Enquiries were set on\r\nfoot and here is their result! A distinguished mental specialist, who\r\nhad been ordered to take a sea voyage for the benefit of his health,\r\nwhich had broken down, had got leave from the Minister for Naval\r\nAffairs to sail on board the Hercule. Deeply interested as he was in\r\nhis own special subject, he had occupied himself during all our stays\r\nin port in collecting brains, both human and animal, which he\r\nimmediately labelled and shut up in a barrel of alcohol, which was\r\nexactly like my barrel of rum. The two barrels had got mixed and my\r\nfather and his guests had been drinking rum flavoured with brains!\r\n\r\nOur squadron dispersed on leaving Jamaica. The admiral, I think, was to\r\ngo to San Domingo, we ourselves to Havana. One of our ships, a\r\nbeautiful despatch boat, the Fabert, bore us company the first day. In\r\nthe evening, the weather being calm, her commander, a lieutenant, M. de\r\nPardeillan, came on board us to dine. Little did we think, as we\r\naccompanied him to the head of the companion, that we were bidding him\r\nan eternal farewell. The ship, the crew, and their young captain all\r\ndisappeared, and have never been heard of again. The sea swallowed them\r\nall up, and the sea has kept the secret.\r\n\r\nAs we entered Havana, I was struck by the sight of a whole fleet of\r\nstrange-looking ships which lay at anchor under the Morro citadel. They\r\nwere long boats, built for speed, with immense sloping spars, like\r\nracing yachts. They were not warships, though they were heavily armed.\r\nThey were slavers, for the negro trade was still in full swing in Cuba.\r\nThe demand for black labour being constantly on the increase, the\r\nslavers went to fetch it from Africa, and brought it back at all risks,\r\nin spite of the British cruisers. But this importation of black cattle,\r\nwhich had been humane and kindly enough while it was free, had grown\r\nfrightfully barbarous since the successful landing of each cargo had\r\nbeen exposed to every chance imaginable. The trade, nevertheless, fed\r\nthe extraordinary prosperity of the fair Spanish colony, Queen of the\r\nAntilles, and especially that of her capital town, the Havana. The stir\r\nin the port itself was prodigious, and how shall I describe the\r\nanimated appearance of the streets, the splendid houses, and the\r\ninnumerable churches that met my gaze, and the evidence of luxury\r\nbetrayed everywhere, and by everything I saw?\r\n\r\nIn the days of his wandering exile, my father had sojourned at Havana,\r\nand my first care was to seek out the friends he had left behind him\r\nthere. Thanks to them, I soon found myself at home, in the Montalvo,\r\nPenalver, Arminteros, Arastegui, O'Reilly and de Arcos families, whose\r\ncharming companionship formed the chief delight of my own stay. My\r\ncousinship with the Queen of Spain caused me to be received with great\r\nhonour, also, by the authorities, especially by the Captain General,\r\nEspeieta. A review was arranged for me on the Paseo Tacon, and of that\r\nsame review I have an undying recollection. Let my readers imagine a\r\nline formed by the Espana, Barcelona and Habana regiments, the\r\nartillery, and a lancer regiment, splendid troops all of them, under\r\nthe command of General Count de Mirasol, with his baton slung at his\r\nbuttonhole. And, facing this line, another of the most exquisitely\r\ncharming aspect. All the volantes in Havana drawn up in battle array!\r\nThe said volantes, peculiar to the place, are gigs without hoods or\r\naprons, perched on two huge wheels, and each drawn by one horse in\r\nsilver-mounted trappings, ridden by a calassero or negro postilion in\r\nflaming livery, laced on every seam. In each volante two ladies\r\nlounged, in evening dress, low-necked, bare-headed, and armed with\r\nfans. Every pretty woman in Havana was there, talking to the occupiers\r\nof the next carriage, looking on and being looked at, and all under a\r\nlovely tropical sunset, which lighted up the sea, whence a soft\r\nrefreshing breeze was blowing, on one side, and on the other a forest\r\nof cocoa palms with the fortress of Principe rising above them. The\r\nensemble of the picture and its details were alike charming, and to us\r\nsailors, just off the sea, it was heightened by contrast. These Havana\r\nladies add all the charm of Spaniards to a mingling of Creole\r\nindifference with the confidence of well-born women. Their eyes and\r\ncomplexions are magnificent, their wrists and ankles exquisitely\r\ndelicate, and their feet! I never saw anything like them--the feet of a\r\nChinese woman, only natural, not produced by torture, I brought away a\r\nprecious souvenir from Havana, in the shape of a shoe which I knew to\r\nbe genuine, but which never met with anything but incredulity till the\r\nsacking of the Tuileries in 1884 bereft me of it altogether.\r\n\r\nI remember yet a beautiful excursion in the interior of the island,\r\npartly by rail, partly by volante, along splendid avenues of palmettos,\r\nand thick shady mango trees, to the country house belonging to Dona\r\nMatilda de Casa Calvo, Marquise de Arcos, where I spent two days in the\r\npleasantest of company, and where Lord Clarence Paget, who was of the\r\nparty, astonished us by his talent as a singer. Our delightful stay in\r\nport was brought to a close by a ball given to me by the town of Havana\r\nat the Societad Philarmonica. I had just been dancing that pretty\r\ndance, a sort of slow valse, which is called the Habanera, and I was\r\nwalking with my partner, a beautiful Spanish Mexican, with tiny feet,\r\nunder the arcades which ran round the patio, when she pulled a\r\nstraw-covered cigarette out of her pocket and lighted it. \"Don't you\r\nsmoke?\" she enquired.\r\n\r\n\"No, Mademoiselle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but yes, I'm sure you will smoke,\" and she took her cigarette from\r\nher pretty lips and gave it to me to smoke, which I did without\r\nhesitation. That sudden conversion has been a durable one. But I have\r\noften regretted that I could not begin it all over again!\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hours later, at two o'clock in the morning, I was wakened\r\nin my cabin by a violent shock. The Hercule had just run aground in the\r\ndangerous waters of the Bahama Channel. Whatever the weather may be,\r\nthe running aground of a huge body like a hundred gun ship is a serious\r\nmatter. To crown our disgrace, the corvette La Favorite, which sailed\r\nin company with us and had followed us blindly, ran aground at the same\r\ninstant. Luckily it was almost calm, and the great Hercule lay quietly\r\non the sand like a stranded whale. Whenever the least suspicion of a\r\nswell came, she gave a shudder, a sort of wag of her tail, which was\r\nvery alarming. If the swell increased she would soon go to pieces, and\r\nevery boat we had to launch would never be enough to save the crew. It\r\nwas one of those anxious moments in a sailor's life when each man makes\r\nit his business to conceal his own feelings. We set hard to work to get\r\ndown a big anchor on the deep-water side. Once it was down and the\r\ncable taut, we began to lighten the ship, pouring all the water\r\noverboard, and getting ready to put the guns over the side. Then\r\ndaylight came, and showed us our real position. A long way off we could\r\nsee a low island on the coast of Florida, called Looe-Key. The dawn\r\nalso showed us, in the offing, the British corvette Pearl, commanded by\r\nour pleasant comrade of some days before, Lord Clarence Paget, who had\r\nsailed from Havana at the same time as we ourselves. As soon as he\r\nperceived our position he hurried to our assistance, and steering with\r\nall the decision and seafaring good sense of the British sailor, he got\r\nas close as possible to us, put down his two anchors at once, and came\r\nto us, saying, \"I bring you the only thing I can, a fixed point to work\r\non.\"\r\n\r\nWe thanked him cordially, but, just at that moment, thanks to our\r\nhaving lightened the ship, and also to the tide, which fortunately\r\nbegan to rise, the Hercule swayed for a few minutes on her sandy bed,\r\nand then began to float. A sigh of relief broke from every breast,\r\nespecially from those of the captain and the unlucky officer of the\r\nwatch, whose carelessness had been the original cause of the accident.\r\n\r\nA few hours more, and everything but a trifling leak had been put to\r\nrights, and we were on our way to the United States--to a new country,\r\na young nation, which attracted me as by instinctive sympathy. On our\r\nvery arrival in the Chesapeake river, I came across a characteristic\r\ntrait. \"Can you speak French?\" I asked the pilot who hailed us.\r\nInstantly he answered me, in English, \"No, I only speak American!\" The\r\nclaim to separate nationality extended even to the language.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards I went ashore, and, armed with an itinerary, kindly\r\ndrawn up for me by Michel Chevalier, in which he had mentioned all he\r\nadvised my seeing, both as to men and things, during the short time at\r\nmy disposal, I started on a hasty tour through that splendid country.\r\nThat first glimpse of America fulfilled all my expectations, and\r\ndelighted me. A young country it was in very deed. Nature itself, to my\r\nEuropean eyes, had a pureness of atmosphere, a richness of vegetation,\r\na freshness, a general air of youth, unknown in our older countries.\r\nMan too, in his gait, in his independence of mind, and his boldness of\r\nenterprise, betrayed an exuberant vigour of which our populations,\r\nenervated by disappointing experiences, and crushed by routine as they\r\nare, have grown incapable.\r\n\r\nAs I desired to get from Norfolk in Virginia to Washington, I started\r\nby the Roanoke Railway, on the first day of my trip, and thus crossed\r\nan immense marsh, the \"Dismal Swamp.\" The rails we ran on being laid\r\nopen-work fashion on huge piles fifteen feet above the marsh, the whole\r\nroad rocked under the weight of the engine, so much as to disturb the\r\nwaters of the swamp and startle the numberless snakes and turtles\r\ninhabiting it. It was a most novel sensation. Further on, betwixt\r\nBaltimore and Philadelphia, the train having to cross an arm of the\r\nsea, steamed on full pace; the engine, uncoupling itself, ran ahead on\r\nto a siding, while our train was carried by its own impetus on to the\r\nupper deck of a steam ferry-boat, moored at the end of the line. It\r\nstopped exactly at the right spot, and while the boat crossed the arm\r\nof the sea, we went below and dined at a splendid buffet on the lower\r\ndeck, waited on by the prettiest of barmaids.\r\n\r\nFurther on yet, between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, in that rich\r\nAllegheny country where the coal-beds lie on the surface, and coal\r\ncosts five francs a ton, and whence petroleum oil was soon to gush\r\nforth, the travelling was done by canal in the flat country, and by\r\nfunicular railways in the mountains, by means of boats built in\r\nsections which hooked together on the water, and were taken apart when\r\nthere was a question of climbing up inclined planes. All public works\r\nand means of communication were full of daring things like these, while\r\nin Europe (I speak of the year 1838) we were still at our first\r\ntimorous essays at railway travelling.\r\n\r\nI travelled through Virginia, passing by all those spots where four and\r\ntwenty years later I was to watch the bloodiest battles of the War of\r\nSecession, that first and awful convulsion of the great Republic's\r\nmanhood. Reaching Washington, I was most courteously received by\r\nPresident Van Buren. How often since then I have been back at the White\r\nHouse, under Presidents Tyler, Buchanan, and Lincoln! How many a\r\ncurious scene I have witnessed there, under the rule of the last-named\r\nPresident, rich as it was in dramatic incident! During that first stay\r\nof mine at Washington I made the acquaintance of three of the greatest\r\nmen in the United States--Calhoun, Webster, and Clay--Calhoun of\r\nCarolina, the impassioned Southerner; Webster, the eloquent\r\nrepresentative of New England Puritanism; and Clay of Kentucky, with\r\nhis angular face and powerful frame, and a curious mixture of extreme\r\ngentleness and energy in his manner and ways--the very type of the\r\nWestern population, the advance-guard of civilization. I was present at\r\nseveral sittings of the Senate, and heard these gentlemen speak with an\r\nauthority which seemed to fascinate their auditors. Washington as a\r\ncity, did not interest me at all--bits of town, scattered about in an\r\nocean of dust, which later on I knew as an ocean of mud; hotels crowded\r\nwith canvassers, all devouring so hurriedly at table d'hote time, that the\r\nfirst arrivals were rising from table when the last ones were sitting\r\ndown, and all this amidst a noise of jaws that reminded me of the dogs\r\nbeing fed in a kennel; the whole population, whether politicians or\r\ncanvassers, chewing and spitting everywhere; little society or none at\r\nall, save that formed by the foreign diplomats, most of them clever\r\nmen, but bored by their isolation, and consequently disposed to see\r\neverything around them with unfavouring eyes. One of the chief members\r\nof this society at the time of my sojourn was the British Minister, Mr.\r\nFox, a diplomatist of the old school, past master in forms, and\r\nproprieties, and social refinements--everything that the English sum up\r\nin the word \"proper.\" I was told that one day as he was leaning against\r\nthe chimney-piece in a drawing-room where dancing was going on, in deep\r\nconversation with I know not what other personage, an American couple\r\ncame and stood just in front of him in a country-dance. Soon the young\r\nman began to show signs of anxiety; his voice grew thick, his cheeks\r\nswelled alternately, and he cast anxious glances at the chimney-piece.\r\nAt last he could hold on no longer, and with the most admirable\r\nprecision, he shot all the juice of his quid into the fireplace just\r\nbetween Mr. Fox and his interlocutor. \"Fine shot, sir!\" the old\r\ndiplomat contented himself with saying, with a bow. It may have been\r\nthat little incidents of this kind cast a chill on international\r\nrelations!\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: southern scout]\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia delighted me. It is a cheerful town, with streets planted\r\nwith fine trees. The prison there, the first built on the solitary\r\nsystem, occupied me for a whole day. I went over every corner of it, in\r\nthe company of the directors, and of any other officials who could\r\ninform me on the subject. It will be known to my readers that the\r\nsystem in this prison, at the time of which I write, was that of\r\nabsolute seclusion in cells--complete isolation in fact--during the\r\nwhole term of sentence. Soon afterwards I visited Auburn Prison, in New\r\nYork State, where the condemned person was subjected to a different\r\nregime,--cells at night, but work in common, though in silence, during\r\nthe day. I have been over many prisons since, for I have always held\r\nthat the management of such places is a pretty reliable thermometer of\r\nthe moral condition of the country to which they belong. I know of some\r\nfoul ones in states which set up to be very civilized. In France we are\r\nlamentably behindhand in the matter. Though we have some prisons which\r\nare model, we have a great many more which are shamefully behind the\r\ntimes. For my own part, I have come to the conclusion, from all I have\r\nseen and heard, that seclusion in cells at night, with work in common\r\nduring the daytime in small easily managed workshops, or better still,\r\nin the open air as at Portland Prison in England, is the penitentiary\r\nsystem which offers the fewest drawbacks. I say drawbacks, for no such\r\nsystem can offer advantages. All the holding forth of philanthropists\r\nabout the sad fate of criminals is empty noise. A prison must be a\r\nplace of punishment; it can never be an abode of reformation, nor of\r\nreclamation.\r\n\r\nLet us pass, from the prisons, to Mr. Norris's great steam engine, and\r\nespecially locomotive engine works, which Michel Chevalier had told me\r\nto be sure to go and see; and most interesting, truly, they were. Great\r\nimprovements in the construction of locomotives originated in these\r\nworks. Mr. Norris had also had a very original and exceedingly American\r\nidea--to make a great orchestra of musical instruments played by steam\r\ninstead of by human lungs. I heard, or at all events I was told I\r\nheard, the \"Hunting Chorus\" in Robin Hood performed by this orchestra,\r\nin which the conductor's baton was replaced by a tap. It was horrible!\r\n\r\nAfter Philadelphia came Niagara, wonderful and peerless. I admired its\r\npicturesque grandeur, but I admired the rapids before the fall every\r\nbit as much. The mighty power of the huge river, the overflow of all\r\nthose great lakes, pouring in foaming fury over its rocky bed, for such\r\na distance and through such splendid scenery, is indescribably\r\nstriking. In the midst of the lovely country of the Hudson Highlands,\r\nstands West Point, the famous military school where all the officers of\r\nthe American army are educated. I was the guest, while there, of\r\nColonel de Russy, who was in command, and my stay was full of interest.\r\nThere is a curious point about the school, and it is not the least of\r\nthe surprises reserved for us by the American democracy. The cadets do\r\nnot enter by examination, but by favour. The Senators, or\r\nrepresentatives of each State in the Union, have a right to a certain\r\nnumber of nominations. The President has the same. Their choice, as a\r\nrule, falls on lads of intelligence, and the only thing asked of them\r\non joining, is to give proof of a healthy constitution. They know\r\nnothing, and have to learn everything in the school, at which they\r\nconsequently spend four years. Well, in spite of the absence of\r\nselection or competition for entrance, the result is quite excellent.\r\nThe knowledge, spirit of discipline and duty of the American officer,\r\nand his adaptability to no matter what task, leave nothing to be\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows New York, that huge cosmopolitan city, the commercial\r\ncapital of the New World, where colossal fortunes are made and lost\r\nwith the giddiest rapidity. Its position as being the chief artery of\r\nhuman activity, is incomparable, but the town--qua town--has this point\r\nin common with all huge agglomerations of commercial buildings. It is\r\nutterly commonplace. I merely passed through it on my way to rejoin my\r\nship at Newport, but with me there came on one of those splendid\r\nsteamers, veritable floating palaces indeed, which the Americans excel\r\nin building, a huge picnic, at which 150 New York ladies were present.\r\nThe night passage across Long Island Sound in lovely weather, with all\r\nthis gay party dancing and supping, was most delightful.\r\n\r\nI left the United States with a feeling of the deepest gratitude for\r\nthe sympathetic, almost affectionate, welcome I had everywhere\r\nreceived, and the most sincere admiration for that great democracy,\r\nambitious without being envious, where shabby class rivalry is unknown,\r\nwhere each man endeavours to rise by his own intelligence, worth, and\r\nenergy, but where no one desires to drag others down to the level of\r\nhis own idleness or mediocrity.\r\n\r\nA great community, in which nobody would for a moment suffer the State\r\nto take to itself the right to interfere between father and child by\r\ndenying the free disposal of his property, and thence his paternal\r\nauthority to the parent.\r\n\r\nA great community, where no man need be a soldier unless he chooses,\r\nand where all are free to bring up their children as they think fit, to\r\npractise the religion that pleases them best, and to combine in perfect\r\nfreedom for the endowment of church or school. What an example, in many\r\nmatters, the young nation sets the old! We left Newport on our return\r\nto France, and after a quick passage of nineteen days, the Hercule\r\nanchored in Brest Roads, on July 10th, 1838.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n1838\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore six weeks were out, I was at sea again, on my way to Mexico. My\r\norders to sail reached me at Luneville, where my brother Nemours had\r\ntaken refuge, with a cavalry command, from the desperate endeavours of\r\nthe grand-parents to get him married, and whither I had followed him\r\nwith the same object. Thanks to my brothers, my memory is crowded with\r\nrecollections of Luneville and the camp there, beginning with that of\r\nan unlucky captain who ruined his career by stopping his squadron at\r\ngalloping drill, before the prostrate form of General Comte de\r\nM--commanding the division, stretched on the broad of his back by a\r\nlively charger with the ringing word of command--\"Obstacle!\"\r\n\r\nDuring my short visit I lived with my brother in the Chateau, where one\r\ngeneral whiled away his sleepless hours by playing the French horn,\r\nmuch to the enjoyment of everybody else! Our evenings were spent at the\r\ntheatre, where there was a ballet A corps de ballet at Luneville! The\r\nwily manager had got out of the difficulty by composing a choregraphic\r\nscenario called Les Sabotiers, in which the only sign of skill asked of\r\nthe lady performers was to swing the sabots on their feet in cadenced\r\ntime. A great noise they made, which did not, however, prevent the\r\nMayor of Luneville from falling asleep regularly every evening in the\r\nmunicipal box, where he sat enthroned perched on a curule chair as high\r\nas that of Thomas Diafoirus. He even fell off it, during a performance\r\nat which I was present, and so noisily that the shock interrupted the\r\nevolutions of the ballet; and all the officers of the garrison who\r\nfilled the stalls, rose with an anxiety which may have been somewhat\r\naffected, and would not be reassured until Mr. Mayor had been fished up\r\nout of the depths of his box, and replaced upon his perch. I recollect,\r\ntoo, an ascent of the Donon, one of the peaks of the Vosges, with a\r\ncharming family of the name of Chevandier, and in the loveliest weather\r\nWhat a view there was! All Lorraine, all Alsace, with the spires of\r\nStrasbourg--that beautiful country which my forefathers of the old\r\nmonarchy had made so truly French. Alas! Alas!\r\n\r\nI went back to my duty. I sailed from Brest on the 1st of September,\r\nunder the orders of Admiral Baudin, a man who had a whole career of\r\nvaliant deeds behind him. One-armed, tall in stature and energetic in\r\ncountenance, he straightway inspired respect, and one soon learnt to\r\nrecognize him as a commander as intelligent as he was resolute, and\r\neven impassioned. His flag was hoisted on the frigate Nereide. I\r\nfollowed, with a small corvette of which I had been given command, and\r\nwhich I had hastily commissioned. Except for the torpedo-boats, and\r\nsuch small flotilla craft, I do not believe the whole of our present\r\nnavy contains such a small vessel as she was She was armed with four\r\nthirty-pounders, and sixteen carronades, mere children's toys, and her\r\ncrew amounted to 100 men. But how pretty she was, careening over, level\r\nwith the water, with her huge spars sloping backwards; and how\r\ncharmingly she was named--La Creole! She was my first command, and I\r\nwas twenty! We were bound on an expedition which might give us a chance\r\nof fighting, and I hoped in my turn to follow the example of my elder\r\nbrothers, who had so well upheld the honour of our race at Antwerp and\r\nin Africa.\r\n\r\nMy emotion on leaving France under such circumstances will be readily\r\nunderstood. My old aide de-camp Hernoux, and Bruat, escorted me outside\r\nthe entrance to the port, and returned in the pilot's boat. The last\r\nlink with the soil of the mother-country was broken, Forward then, my\r\nboy!\r\n\r\nIn a few days we were before Cadiz, that lovely Andalusian city. An\r\nAfrican sun had come to heighten its beauty, and it looked like some\r\nexquisite carving in the whitest marble, rising fairylike out of a\r\nsapphire sea. My landing in the evening was just as full of charm. I\r\nhurried to the Alameda, the public promenade, where the silence was\r\nunbroken, save by the plash of the waves breaking at the foot of the\r\nramparts, or the whisper of the breeze amongst the palm-trees. I caught\r\nsight of mysterious couples sitting in the shadows of the alamos, black\r\ndresses and mantillas blending with the men's \"capas,\" and from these\r\nformless groups a stifled murmur rose, with the noise of fans, like the\r\nbeating wings of an imprisoned bird. I wandered through the streets and\r\nthe Plazo Santo Antonio. I saw delightful balconies and glistening eyes\r\nthat shone behind the lattices; exquisite forms glided over the white\r\nflags on which the moonlight fell. I saw, in fine, a city, a whole\r\npopulation, instinct with the breath of love, and I caught the\r\ncomplaint myself. I dreamt of scaling balconies, and of kisses and\r\ntender words, jealous rivals draped in black cloaks, and knife-thrusts\r\nat street corners under the lamps, and all the struggle and danger and\r\ntriumph without which life is not life at all.\r\n\r\nThere happened to be a bull-fight, during our short stay in this port,\r\nat the Puerto de Santa Maria--one of those bull-fights celebrated in\r\nthat famous song that every Spaniard hums even nowadays, \"Los Toros del\r\nPuerto.\" I took good care not to miss it, and I will take still better\r\ncare not to describe it, although the chief \"espada\" was Chiclanero,\r\nthe handsomest of all those handsome fellows, and the one who was said\r\nto have roused the most violently passionate fondness in the fair sex.\r\nFifty years ago there were no railroads in Andalusia, nor carriages\r\neither. Majos and Majas (Goya's Majos and Majas still existed in those\r\ndays) arrived on horseback from all quarters under the burning\r\nSeptember sun, and no words of mine can give any idea of the motley\r\ncrowd in the most brilliant costumes, the perfect orgie of colour\r\npresented by the neighbourhood of the plaza, on which, as a finishing\r\ntouch to the quaintness of the scene, a squadron of yellow dragoons did\r\nduty as police! From Cadiz we sailed in company with the frigates La\r\nGloire and La Medee and two steam corvettes which we had found there,\r\nand reached Cape Saint Antonio, the most westerly point of Cuba, after\r\na thirty-six days' passage. Once there, the admiral took all the water\r\nand provisions out of the Gloire and the Creole, and sent us to\r\nrevictual at Havana, while he went on his way to Mexico and Vera Cruz.\r\nWith my habitual extreme indifference to politics (having, in fact,\r\nalways hated them), I have forgotten to say WHY we were going to\r\nMexico. It was the eternal old story. Demands timidly made and then\r\nspurned, insufficient force for action merely increasing the insolence\r\nof our opponents, and then the necessity for sending a large and\r\nexpensive expedition to finish up with. A score of war-vessels,\r\nincluding four frigates and two bomb-vessels, were soon to be collected\r\nbefore Vera Cruz, with a certain number of troops to be landed, and to\r\ndeal authoritatively with the Mexican Government. Meanwhile we were to\r\ngo, Captain Laine and I, to Havana, to lay in provisions, take\r\neverything we could to the squadron on board, and also, so the admiral\r\nhad told me confidentially, I was to endeavour personally to get\r\ntogether all the plans and information possible concerning the towns on\r\nthe Mexican coast and the fort of Saint Juan d'Ulloa, which had all\r\nonce been Spanish. Nothing could have suited me better than this run to\r\nHavana, where we anchored four days later, and of which place I had\r\ncarried away such pleasant memories seven months before. And as soon as\r\nI had paid and returned my official visits, I hurried to the Tacon\r\nTheatre, where, in a stage box that I knew right well, I beheld the\r\ncharming woman who had begun my education as a smoker so prettily\r\nduring my first visit.\r\n\r\nWe got the worst of news from Mexico. While Admiral Baudin was hurrying\r\nthither by forced marches, as it were, the ships that had got there\r\nbefore us had well-nigh raised the blockade. The frigate Herminie had\r\nstarted for France, which she never was to reach. She was wrecked at\r\nthe Bermudas. The Iphigenie, which Captain de Parseval still commanded\r\nhad been obliged to depart too, with nothing but a remnant of her crew,\r\nthe yellow fever, which was then raging, having made terrible ravages\r\non board. I heard of the death of many a good friend. Captain de\r\nParseval had only one officer left (Kerjegu, who in later days was my\r\ncolleague in the National Assembly) and one cadet, to help him to get\r\nhis frigate away. There had been a tempest too, which had done a great\r\ndeal of damage to our cruisers. I saw two come in, the Eclipse,\r\nCommander Jame de Bellecroix, and the Laurier, Captain Duquesne, which\r\nhad been dismasted in the gale, and which had rigged up temporary\r\nspars, by means of which they had contrived to crawl into port. All the\r\nsails of the Laurier had been carried away, and she was quite helpless\r\nin the storm, so her captain, Duquesne, and his second officer,\r\nMazeres, lashed themselves on deck, after having sent the crew below.\r\nThe violence of the wind laid the ship so completely over on her beam\r\nends that Lieutenant Mazeres, who was carried overboard by a wave,\r\ncaught hold of the maintop and managed to get back on deck. A moment\r\nlater the two masts of the brig were broken by the fury of the sea, and\r\nthus she regained her balance and was saved.\r\n\r\nLeaving all these cripples to patch themselves up as best they could,\r\nCaptain Laine set sail with his frigate and gave me orders to follow.\r\nWe reached Sacrificios, the nearest anchorage to Vera Cruz, after a\r\nrapid passage. Here we learnt that the captain of the Medee, M. Leray,\r\nhad been sent on a mission to Mexico. Then the admiral himself went off\r\nto Xalapa, to confer with the Mexican ministers. Meanwhile the blockade\r\nwent on, enlivened by privations of every kind, short rations of water,\r\nyellow fever, and so forth. Our water was brought from Havana; it came\r\nin barrels, and was frequently black and nauseous when it came out of\r\nthem. Yellow fever stalked abroad. I lingered one night, fishing over\r\nthe side of the ship, until eleven o'clock, with a strong, healthy,\r\nfirst-class cadet, who had been under me in the watch on board the\r\nDidon. A foreboding of some sort seemed to weigh on his mind. I tried\r\nto cheer him up, but all in vain. By six o'clock next morning the\r\nterrible \"vomito\" had carried him off. Poor Gouin! I was very fond of\r\nhim. We buried him on the Sacrificios islet, that gloomy cemetery which\r\nlater on the Zouaves christened the \"Jardin d'Acclimatation.\"\r\n\r\nBut little happened to vary the monotony of those weeks of waiting. I\r\nhad gone in my boat one day to take soundings in shore, along the coast\r\nstretching from Vera Cruz to Anton Lizardo, when I saw a squadron of\r\nMexican Lancers in their great white hats, looking like a squadron of\r\npicadors from a bull-ring, come galloping over the sand-hills. It was\r\nmore than likely these gentry might fire their carbines at us, and we\r\nhad no arms to reply with. So I bethought me of an expedient, which\r\nturned out quite successful. Instead of retiring as fast as we could\r\nrow, I ordered my crew to lie motionless on their oars, while with the\r\nhelp of two men I made as though I were carefully preparing, loading,\r\nand laying a heavy gun, which was nothing more than a large-sized\r\ntelescope with which I happened to be provided. The effect was\r\nelectric. We saw the Mexican squadron make off full tear in every\r\ndirection, to the delight of my crew. One night we had another\r\nadventure. The admiral sent me, with Messrs. Desfosses and Doret, and\r\ntwo engineer officers, Commandant Mangin-Lecreux and Captain Chauchard,\r\nto make rather an odd sort of reconnaissance. To understand its nature,\r\nmy readers must know that the fort of Saint Juan d'Ulloa is set on a\r\ngreat reef, separated from Vera Cruz by a narrow arm of the sea. On the\r\nedge of the reef looking towards the town, the walls of the fort, into\r\nwhich huge iron rings for mooring big ships are built, go\r\nperpendicularly down into the sea. On the opposite side the glacis runs\r\ninto a sort of large lake formed by two arms of the reef, level with\r\nthe surface of the sea. The admiral wanted to know whether the bed of\r\nthis lake was level, whether it was fordable, and whether, in case of\r\nnecessity, the glacis and the walls of the fort could be reached from\r\nit, after they had been gutted by the big guns.\r\n\r\nWe started, then, one fine night, reached the belt of reef far away\r\nfrom the fort, landed, and walking through the water, which was half\r\nway up to our thighs at the start, we bent our course towards the fort,\r\ntaking soundings before us, as we went, with long sticks. We found much\r\nthe same depth everywhere, and a sandy bed covered with short seaweed.\r\nThe sea had doubtless cast all the sand by degrees over the coral reef,\r\nand the currents had levelled it. After a long and tiring march through\r\nthe water, during which we had to stop and take breath every now and\r\nagain, whispering to each other, like Raffet's engraving of a similar\r\nreconnaissance, \"Smoking is forbidden, but you can sit down if you\r\nlike,\" we had got quite close to the glacis when we heard a shout of\r\n\"Alerta!\" from the sentries. Commandant Mangin, who was determined to\r\ntouch the glacis with his hand, was a few steps ahead of us. Suddenly a\r\nnoise arose within the fort, and in the twinkling of an eye we saw\r\nabout fifty soldiers appear on the crest of the glacis, with their\r\nmusket barrels glancing. They rushed down at full speed and sprang into\r\nthe water after us. We of course made off as fast as ever we could. For\r\nsome minutes it was a downright trial of speed, and Commandant Mangin\r\nwas all but caught. But though hostilities were imminent, they had not\r\nyet actually begun. So the soldiers did not fire, and they soon tired\r\nof pursuing us. We got back without any difficulty, except that great\r\nfishes, whose every movement was visible in the phosphorescent water,\r\nwould rush between our legs. Sharks, perhaps! There were numbers of\r\nthem in those parts.\r\n\r\nThe admiral had learnt what he wanted to know. A few days more and the\r\nball opened. The admiral brought the three frigates, Nereide, Gloire,\r\nand Iphigenie (this last came back from Havana with her crew completed\r\nby that of Duquesne's brig), and the two bomb-vessels, broadside on,\r\nand attacked the fort. I had asked leave to share in the fun, and, to\r\nmy great grief, he had refused it. He considered my ship too small and\r\ninsignificant. \"I can't possibly take you. I have put the frigate Medee\r\naside too, for I don't consider her guns heavy enough.\" He sent me to\r\nwatch the firing of the bomb-vessels, and rectify it if necessary.\r\n\r\nBefore the firing began an incident occurred in which I was directly\r\nconcerned. As the attack appeared imminent, the ships anchored or\r\nmoored close to the fort hastened away, and they all passed close to\r\nthe point where I was posted. At that moment the admiral signalled to\r\nme, \"Ship in sight looks suspicious; stop her\" Ambiguous as our\r\nsignalling code is, this order seemed evidently to point to seizing one\r\nor several of the vessels just leaving the port. Of these there were\r\nfour, to wit, a Belgian ship, chartered by the admiral to take off the\r\nFrench subjects resident at Vera Cruz if they should be threatened. It\r\ncould not be that one. Then there was an American vessel, a quasi\r\nwarship, flying a pennant and armed, what is called a revenue schooner.\r\nThirdly, the British steam-packet Express, also armed and flying a\r\npennant, commanded by a lieutenant in the British Navy, and borne on\r\nthe Navy List as a ship of war. It could be neither of these two, to my\r\nthinking. There only remained a Hamburg vessel, which I ordered to go\r\nand anchor under the guns of the corvette Naiade. But at this instant a\r\nlieutenant in one of the Nereide's boats came to me and shouted, \"The\r\nadmiral desires you will take the Mexican pilots off all ships going\r\nout of port.\"\r\n\r\n\"Off the English packet too?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"The admiral gave no details, he said all pilots.\"\r\n\r\nThough it seemed a serious matter to me, considering the touchiness of\r\nthe English, to take a man off one of their warships, I had no course\r\nbut to act. The Express had passed astern of me, and I had exchanged\r\nfriendly greetings with her captain, Lieutenant Cooke, with whom I was\r\nacquainted. She was far away already. I hoisted the British flag, and\r\nbacked my action with a shot across her bow. She brought to, waited for\r\nthe boat and officer I sent, and the following conversation ensued:--\r\n\r\nMy Officer.--\"My orders are to ask you for your pilot.\"\r\n\r\nLieutenant Cooke.--\"I want him to get to Sacrificios.\"\r\n\r\nMy Officer.--\"It isn't a mere request I make you.\"\r\n\r\nLieutenant Cooke.--\"If I don't give him up, shall you take him by\r\nforce?\"\r\n\r\nMy Officer.--\"We trust you will give him up with a good grace, and that\r\nwe need have no recourse to violence.\"\r\n\r\nLieutenant Cooke.--\"That's very well, sir,\" and the conversation closed\r\nwith a shake of the hand, once the British commander had cleared\r\nhimself of responsibility. So the pilot entered my boat, whence the\r\nadmiral instantly had him fetched. The American revenue schooner gave\r\nhers up without making any difficulty, only declaring the admiral\r\nresponsible for any accident that might happen to the ship for want of\r\na pilot.\r\n\r\nI have related this incident of the pilot of the Express in detail\r\nbecause it gave rise to a heated discussion in the British Parliament,\r\nduring which I was personally taken to task and made responsible for a\r\n\"violation of international law.\"\r\n\r\nBut the admiral gives the signal to open fire, and the cannonade\r\nbegins. In one moment I am wrapped in smoke. I not only cannot see to\r\nwatch the firing, I cannot even see where I am going. The lead gives\r\nvery little depth, and I see the mud disturbed by my keel rising on the\r\nsurface of the water. I cannot stay where I am, so I crowd on sail and\r\nget out of the smoke. I repeat my petition for leave to take part in\r\nthe fight to the admiral by signal. His heart is touched, and he\r\nanswered by the welcome word \"Yes,\" and then I go down the line of\r\nfrigates, all hotly engaged, especially the Iphigenie. Every minute or\r\ntwo I saw splinters of wood flying into the air, cut out by the shot\r\nstriking her. She had a hundred and eight in her hull, without counting\r\nher spars. There were eight in her foremasts alone. It was a perfect\r\nmiracle everything did not come by the board. That gallant old fellow\r\nParseval kept walking up and down the poop, rubbing his hands whenever\r\na shot struck near him. It was really a fine sight. We waved our hands\r\nto each other, and I went and took up my position at the end of the\r\nline of frigates. There I stayed, going to and fro under sail, amid a\r\nlittle racket of my own making.\r\n\r\nThere were hard times within the fort. There had been several\r\nexplosions already, and it occurred to me to load al my guns with shell\r\nand turn them on a sort of tower, called in fortification a cavalier,\r\nwhence the fire was particularly lively. I had very good gunners, but\r\nfrom my place as commanding officer I could not see where the shots\r\ntook effect for the smoke. My second officer who was forward, could\r\njudge better than me. At the first shot he shouted to me \"Good! in the\r\ncavalier.\" The second, \"In the cavalier.\" The third, \"In the cavalier.\"\r\nThe fourth--nothing was to be seen. A huge cloud of smoke white above,\r\nblack below, rose from the fort, slowly to a great height above it.\r\nWhen it cleared a little, driven by the wind, there was no cavalier at\r\nall. The whole thing had blown up. My crew shouted with delight, and\r\nthe captain of one of the guns performed a brilliant hornpipe. Was it\r\nmy shells? Or did the bombs from the bombship do the job? Not one of my\r\nbrave fellows on the Creole have the shadow of a doubt. Every man has a\r\nright to his own opinion.\r\n\r\nThe fire slackened, and I went to take the admiral's orders. The fort\r\nsurrendered during the night. The garrison, two thousand strong,\r\nevacuated the place, and a convention was concluded with the general in\r\ncommand at Vera Cruz for the abstention of both sides from further\r\nhostilities. We then occupied the fort, and the admiral gave me orders\r\nto moor the Creole under its walls, and together with Comte de Gourdon,\r\ncommanding the Cuirassier, to put prize crews on board the vessels of\r\nthe Mexican Navy lying there. With the exception of one pretty\r\ncorvette, the Iguana, which has been incorporated with our own navy,\r\nthese prizes were not worth much.\r\n\r\nThe unlucky fort was in a terrible condition. Shot and shell and\r\nexplosions had destroyed everything. A horrible smell rose from the\r\nnumerous corpses buried everywhere under the rubbish. Wherever battle\r\nhad not done its work the most revolting filth reigned supreme, and all\r\nthis under an equatorial sun and in the midst of the yellow fever. The\r\ncrew of the Creole was at once set to sanitary work, in company with\r\nthe detachment of engineer sappers attached to the expedition. We dug\r\nout the corpses and towed them out to sea, and several very meritorious\r\ninstances of self-sacrifice occurred which were duly and publicly\r\nrecognised by the admiral.\r\n\r\nMy aide-de-camp, M. Desfosses, had drawn up a little code of signals,\r\nby means of coloured shirts, with the house of our consul at Vera Cruz,\r\nin case of any emergency. Within five days of the taking of the fort we\r\nlearnt by these signals that the French subjects within the town were\r\nin great danger. We immediately sent all our boats to the mole, which\r\nwas thronged by a distracted crowd of men, women, and children, all of\r\nwhom we received and transferred to the fort.\r\n\r\nAt the same time our consul informed us that Santa Anna, who had been\r\nappointed generalissimo, had just arrived with troops, that he had\r\ndeclared the convention null and void, &c., &c., and that we must be\r\nprepared for anything. The admiral, who was some way off, with the\r\nsquadron, at the Green Island anchorage, was at once warned. Luckily it\r\nwas fine. If it had not been, no communication with him would have been\r\npracticable The admiral himself came that very night, and took up his\r\nquarters on board the Creole. In his usual resolute way, he had at once\r\ndecided to forestall the enemy's action, and, taking advantage of its\r\nsurprise, to execute such a coup de main with the feeble means at his\r\ndisposal, as would make it impossible for the city and forts of Vera\r\nCruz to harm us for some time to come at all events. Our night was\r\ntherefore spent in preparation. The boats of the squadron came in one\r\nafter the other without any mishap, bringing all the men who could be\r\nlanded. Counting the three companies of artillery holding the fort,\r\nthese amounted to about eleven hundred men. We set out between four and\r\nfive o'clock in the morning in a thick fog. A portion of the troops\r\ndisembarked, commanded by Captain Parseval, were to scale the small\r\nfort on the left of the town with ladders, and then go round the\r\nramparts, spiking the guns, and destroying everything they came across.\r\nAnother body, under Captain Laine, was to do the same thing on the\r\nright-hand side. And a third column in the centre was to land on the\r\nmole, blow up the sea gate, and march on General de Santa Anna's\r\nheadquarters to try and seize his person. My own company, numbering\r\nabout sixty men, formed the advance guard of this last column, the bulk\r\nof which consisted of the three companies of artillery.\r\n\r\nWe started then, with our oars muffled to deaden the noise. We could\r\nhardly find our way in the twilight, and had to strain our eyes to see\r\nthe mole through the mist. The great gate of the city was closed, no\r\nsentry outside it. Everything was asleep. We landed in dead silence,\r\nand the column formed up. The sappers ran on ahead, laid the powder\r\nbag, and masked it, then a sergeant of sappers lighted the match and\r\nshrank back behind a projecting bit of wall. Bang! The mask of the\r\npetard just grazed our heads, and one side of the gate lay on the\r\nground. At the same moment firing began in the direction of Parseval's\r\ncolumn. \"Forward! God save the King!\" We caught sight of the guard at\r\nthe gate bolting off, and then lost it in the fog. There wasn't a cat\r\nin the streets. The noise of the musketry fire had driven in anybody\r\nwho might have been out. Led by a guide we passed at a swinging pace\r\ndown a street which brought us to the Mexico gate. Here the fog lifted\r\na little. A few shots and bayonet thrusts got rid of the guard at the\r\ngate. Just at this moment a barouche galloped up from within the town.\r\nIt was drawn by six mules with picturesque-looking postilions, in\r\nbroad-brimmed hats. It was the barouche which had brought Santa Anna,\r\ntrying to get into the open country. We shot down two or three of the\r\nmules, but the carriage was empty.\r\n\r\nWe then received a heavy discharge of musketry from about a hundred and\r\nfifty soldiers who forthwith disappeared down a side street. They were\r\nthe headquarters guard. Off we tore after them, and were just in time\r\nto see the last of them go into a big house which my guide informed me\r\nwas the headquarters of the military governor. A huge court with\r\ngalleries running round it, and above them on the first floor more\r\narcades, adorned with flowers in pots and climbing plants, met our gaze\r\nwhen we entered. A sharp fire poured from the first floor the instant\r\nwe appeared in the courtyard. Hesitation would be fatal. We must get\r\nupstairs and bring those folk to their senses. A narrow stairway was\r\nthe only road. Well, every man must own to some weakness! When I saw\r\nthat staircase, up which I should have to go first, and receive the\r\nfirst volley alone when I got to the top, I wavered for a moment, and\r\nwaving my sword, I shouted, \"Volunteers to the front!\" My\r\nquartermaster, a Parisian, rushed to the staircase, and the sight\r\nbrought me back to a sense of my duty. I rushed after him. We raced\r\nagainst each other, and I had the satisfaction of getting to the top a\r\ngood first, followed indeed by my whole company. There was nothing so\r\nvery terrible about it after all. At first we found ourselves in a sort\r\nof vestibule; an ill-directed fire, which wounded two of our officers\r\nonly, pouring on us through the doors and windows. Then each of us set\r\nto work on his own account. A second boatswain, of the name of Jadot,\r\nand I threw ourselves against a door and broke it in with our\r\nshoulders. When it gave, I was shot forward by my men pushing on behind\r\nme, and hurled into a room full of smoke and Mexican soldiers. One of\r\nthem, in a white uniform and red epaulettes (I see his straight Indian\r\nhair and wicked eye yet), was aiming at me with the barrel of his\r\nmusket close to my face. I had just time to say to myself, \"I'm done\r\nfor.\" But no, there was no shot, the gun fell on my feet, and I saw my\r\ngentleman roll under a sofa carrying the sword with which Penaud, my\r\nlieutenant, had run him through as quick as lightning, stuck between\r\nhis ribs.\r\n\r\nI believe I rid myself of another great big fellow next, and then, the\r\nfirst start having been given, there was a general rout, and I found\r\nmyself in another room at the end of which I saw several officers, one\r\na general, standing together very calmly, with their swords sheathed. I\r\nrushed forward with the boatswain Jadot, to protect them from my men,\r\nwho were somewhat excited, and the fight was over. The name of the\r\ngeneral, a tall fair handsome fellow, was Arista. In later days he\r\nbecame President of the Mexican Republic. He surrendered his sword to\r\nme, and I had him taken downstairs, and left him in the hands of\r\nartillery Commandant Colombel, who sent him to the fort. As for Santa\r\nAnna, we could not find him, though his bed was still warm. We took his\r\nepaulettes, and his commanding officer's baton, and Jadot the\r\nboatswain, who had lost his own straw hat in the scuffle, put on his\r\ngold tipped one.\r\n\r\nI lost no time in quitting the house, which was full of blood, and\r\nwhere I was sickened by the sight of the bodies of two wretched women\r\nwho had been killed by the fire through the doors Once outside I met\r\nCaptain Laine, coming by the ramparts, and carrying out his task of\r\ndestruction as he went. He urged me to march with my company on a point\r\nin the town where Parseval's column was keeping up a steady fire,\r\nkeeping an eye meanwhile on the churches, the towers of which were\r\nreported to be armed with cannon. I set out on this true \"course au\r\nclocher\" and presently got to a large building from which we were fired\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nWe entered. It was the hospital. There was another shindy in a big room\r\non the ground floor, full of sick, standing up or kneeling on their\r\nbeds, scantily covered with red blankets, and all shouting \"Gracia!\"\r\n\"Mercy!\" It was a horrible sight. All the poor wretches were more or\r\nless far gone in yellow fever. We went in at one door and hurried out\r\nat the other, and at last we got into a long straight street, at the\r\nend of which we saw a large house with musketry fire crackling from\r\nevery window like a great set piece of fireworks. This huge and solid\r\nbuilding, set astride on the ramparts, with doors on to the town, and\r\ndoors into the country, was called the \"la Merced barracks. Full of\r\ntroops as it was, and with reinforcements constantly coming in from\r\noutside, it had stopped Parseval's column ever since the morning, and\r\nwas soon to stop Laine's as well. One great door faced the street up\r\nwhich we were going. Of course it was shut. We brought a gun to bear on\r\nit, and sent a shell into it. Amid the smoke of the discharge, mingled\r\nwith the sort of fog that was still hanging, we thought the door was\r\nbroken in, and rushed forward. But when we got near we found the cursed\r\nthing was intact, and we were forced to throw ourselves back into the\r\nside streets for shelter, for in one instant the whole head of our\r\ncolumn, six or seven being officers, had been killed or wounded. We\r\nthen set to work, sappers, artillerymen, sailors, and all, to throw up\r\na barricade across the street, so as to bring up a battery of guns, and\r\nbreak that door right down before beginning the attack afresh. But just\r\non this the admiral arrived and the chiefs in command took counsel with\r\nhim. Considering half our crews were on shore and that the slightest\r\nchange in the weather might prevent their getting back on board ship,\r\nand considering too that the admiral's object had been attained, he\r\ngave orders for us to re-embark. The return journey offered no\r\ndifficulty, except at the very last moment, when nobody was left on the\r\nmole but the admiral and a few officers. Then, a great sound of\r\ncheering and of warlike music was heard in the town. It was Santa Anna\r\ncoming to drive the Frenchmen into the sea. Out he came, on horseback,\r\non to the mole, at the head of his men, but the launches from the\r\nfrigates which were still lying on each side of the jetty fired grape\r\nshot into the head of the column, and laid everybody low,--Santa Anna\r\nand the rest of them. Some fanatics rushed to the end of the mole in\r\nspite of this, to try and shoot the admiral point blank, and he was in\r\ngreat danger. His coxswain and the midshipman on duty, Halna Dufretay\r\n(an admiral and a senator when he died), covered him with their own\r\nbodies and were both severely wounded. His secretary, who was with him,\r\nand who carried a double-barrelled rifle, killed two Mexicans in two\r\nshots. A great friend of mine was killed there too, a charming young\r\nfellow who had a great future before him--Chaptal, a first-class cadet.\r\nIt was known that I was much attached to him and I was given his\r\naiguillettes (which I sent to his family) as a remembrance of him. When\r\nI got back to the Creole, bringing two of my midshipmen, Magnier de\r\nMaisonneuve and Gervais, with me, both severely wounded, the admiral\r\nsent me orders to fire a shell into the \"la Merced\" barracks every five\r\nminutes. This closed the day of my baptism of fire. The military\r\noperations of the campaign were over. The fort of Saint Juan d'Ulloa\r\nremained in our hands in pledge. It was the diplomats' business to\r\ncomplete the work. The admiral dismissed the greater number of his\r\nships and soon sent me off to Havana, which place I did not reach\r\nwithout falling in with two of those violent squalls which are called\r\nnorte in the Gulf of Mexico. I was to lie there on the watch, ready to\r\nattack privateers if the Mexican Government should resort to that form\r\nof warfare--the fleetness of the Creole fitting her specially for such\r\nservice. Meanwhile my visit was very pleasant to me, after the horrors\r\nof Sacrificio and the yellow fever. The commander of an English\r\ncorvette, the Satellite, gave a dinner to M. de Parseval, two other\r\ncaptains and myself, which was so cordial that towards dessert one of\r\nthe captains, who shall be nameless, passed his hand gently across his\r\nbrow and, murmuring \"I don't feel very well,\" sank straightway\r\nunderneath the table. We took him by the legs and shoulders, Parseval\r\nand the English captain and I, but Parseval and the Englishman laughed\r\nso much that we had some trouble in getting him to a bed, on which we\r\nlaid him and where he slept till morning. I know not whether it was for\r\nthis wound and feat of arms that his native town raised a statue in his\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nOf course I sought and found all my former Havanese acquaintances. One\r\nalone was invisible, the lady of the cigarette. In vain I placed myself\r\nnight after night before her box. Nobody there! In vain I paid visits\r\nto houses I knew she frequented. The covers were all blank. I was\r\nsorely grieved. So then I bethought me of a stratagem. The Creole set\r\nsail hurriedly, with much bustle, to go and look for a Mexican ship,\r\nreported, so they said, to be at sea. As soon as the day closed in I\r\nmade all sail for the port, and leaving my second officer in command,\r\nwith orders to pick me up at four o'clock next morning at a certain\r\ndistance and in a certain line from the harbour lights, I jumped into\r\nmy boat and went ashore. With a bound I was in the theatre. There she\r\nwas! And I laugh still when I think of her grandparents' faces when\r\nthey saw me appear; but they raised the quarantine forthwith, and when,\r\nsoon after, I gave a ball on board the Iphigenie, that charming young\r\nlady was its chief ornament. Beautiful and quaint that ball was, breezy\r\nwith victory and duty well performed, the glorious scars of the old\r\nIphigenie mingling with the splendour of the flowers and the lights.\r\n\r\nAfter staying a month at Havana, as there was no question of pirates, I\r\nwas ordered to take the Creole back to Brest, where I arrived in March,\r\n1839. My monkey was the first to see and point out the land from the\r\ntop of the rigging. I had hardly got into the roadstead before the\r\nmaritime prefect boarded me to tell me I was made a knight of the\r\nLegion of Honour. The worthy admiral insisted on receiving me as such\r\nbefore the guard, which had been turned out. He drew his sword to give\r\nme the accolade, and made me a little speech, under the fire of which I\r\ndid not flinch, though he was deeply moved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n1839\r\n\r\n\r\nScarcely had I landed from the Creole when I received the distressing\r\nnews of the death of my sister Marie, Duchess of Wurtemberg. It was the\r\nfirst mourning in our family, the first break in that numerous circle\r\nof tenderly attached brothers and sisters. I adored my sister, who was\r\na most remarkable woman, witty, as passionate in her antipathies as in\r\nher affections, an artist to the very tips of her fingers. Her death\r\nwas a deep sorrow to me, and it saddened my short stay among my own\r\npeople. A short stay it was indeed, for I only came ashore in March,\r\nand June found me at the entrance of the Dardanelles, attached to the\r\nstaff of Admiral Lalande, commanding our squadron in the Levant.\r\n\r\nI had rather a funny little adventure on my way to take up my duty. I\r\nhad asked the then Minister of the Interior, M. Duchatel, to give\r\norders that there should be no official reception when I passed through\r\nToulon--no firing of guns, nor authorities waiting at the city gates,\r\nnor troops drawn up, all that wearisome and commonplace ceremonial\r\nwhich I had been through I know not how many times already. The\r\nminister had given his promise, and, strong in his assurance, I was\r\njust getting there quietly in my travelling-carriage, when the sight of\r\na mounted gendarme, who galloped off the moment he caught sight of us\r\njust after we got through the pass of Ollioules, made me suspect some\r\ntreachery or other. Without a second's hesitation I jumped out of the\r\ncarriage, the moment the gendarme was out of sight, and desiring my\r\nvalet to go on with it, struck across the fields on foot to the\r\nharbour. I had not been mistaken, for soon I heard twenty-one guns\r\ngreeting the entrance of my empty vehicle into Toulon, doubtless amid\r\nwhat the stereotyped official phrase would call, and with good reason\r\nthis time, a scene of indescribable enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nImportant events were occurring in the east in rapid succession at the\r\ntime I joined Lalande's squadron. The recommencement of the struggle\r\nbetween ancient Turkey and that youthful Egypt which the genius of\r\nMehemet Ali had created, had just ended in the final defeat of the\r\nTurks in the battle of Nezib--a defeat which was closely followed by\r\nthe death of Sultan Mahmoud, the last of the determined autocrats of\r\nthe race of Othman. Action on the part of the European fleet might\r\narise at any moment, owing to these complications and the rivalries\r\nthereby excited between England and Russia--great Eastern powers both\r\nof them. Our sole preoccupation therefore during our cruise in the\r\nDardanelles was to get our ships into such condition that they might\r\nmake a good show in the event of anything of the kind occurring. I have\r\nrelated elsewhere how we succeeded, under the powerful will of Admiral\r\nLalande, in reconstituting such a fighting fleet as we had never\r\npossessed since the Revolution swept away at one fell swoop the whole\r\nof the navy of Louis XVI., with its body of first-class officers, and\r\nall that collection of traditions both as to discipline and knowledge\r\nwhich it had gradually acquired.\r\n\r\nThe admiral's great merit lay in reconstituting these traditions, which\r\nhave taken deep root and are carefully treasured still. And the curious\r\nthing, the peculiar trait, about him was that, though he desired\r\ncertain results, he would have nothing to do with the means to\r\nattaining them. This state of warlike efficiency was not obtained\r\nwithout trouble. Constantly under sail, and overtaxed with rough and\r\nunaccustomed forms of drill as the crews were, demoralized too by\r\naccidents--men killed or arms and legs broken--the result insisted on\r\nby the chief in command was only reached by treating them with extreme\r\nseverity. On board the Jena, the flagship, corporal\r\npunishment--nowadays found useless, and therefore very properly\r\nabolished--was of daily occurrence. But the admiral ignored it, never\r\nwould have it even mentioned to him. He left all that to his flag\r\ncaptain, my friend Bruat, a most energetic officer. I never heard one\r\nword of reprimand from Admiral Lalande's lips, and once I saw him get\r\ninto a fury with one of his captains, who had appealed to his\r\ndisciplinary authority. The scene is worth describing.\r\n\r\nThis worthy captain (his name was Danican) commanded the ship Jupiter,\r\non which I had taken passage from Toulon to join the squadron, and one\r\nof my earliest duties was to present the new comer, with his staff, to\r\nthe admiral. These gentlemen stood in a circle in the great cabin round\r\nCaptain Danican, armed to the teeth, cocked hat in hand, and his\r\nsword-belt buckled high up round his little body. There they waited.\r\n\"Pere Danican,' as he was familiarly called, a veteran sailor, whose\r\nname is borne by one of the streets in St. Malo, had the most splendid\r\nservice record, with this item in particular, that he had been reported\r\nas killed in a fight with the English. He had been struck in the belly\r\nby grape-shot, lost consciousness, and laid out with the rest of the\r\ndead, of whom a list was being made before throwing them overboard one\r\nafter the other, when the battle was over They were actually swinging\r\nhim backwards and forwards to heave him over the side, when one of his\r\ncomrades called out, \"Hold on. Let Danican alone. We'll give him a\r\nfuneral\"--to which ceremony the old Breton owed his life, though it did\r\nnot soften the by no means placid character of the strict old\r\ndisciplinarian.\r\n\r\nAnd accordingly, something in his eye, when the admiral came skipping\r\nin smilingly, with a commonplace \"Good-day, Danican\" \"Good-day\r\ngentlemen,\" warned me we were going to have a scene. \"Admiral,\" he\r\nshouted in a voice of thunder, \"I have the honour to present the staff\r\nof the ship Jupiter to you--and I take this opportunity, Admiral, of\r\ntelling you that it would be impossible to be more dissatisfied with\r\nthese gentlemen than I am!\" This tirade concluded by a violent wave of\r\nhis cocked hat, while the officers stood motionless and stared at the\r\ndeck. A thunderbolt falling out of heaven would not have startled the\r\nadmiral more than this speech. I never saw any man so put out of\r\ncountenance. He shuffled his feet, gave a forced laugh, and not finding\r\nanything to say, stammered some disconnected words, \"I trust . . . my\r\ndear. . . Danican .... a regard for duty . . . these gentlemen ....!\"\r\nWe put a stop to the distressing scene by low bows of dismissal, and\r\neverybody went off in a rage--the officers with their captain, the\r\ncaptain with the admiral for not supporting discipline, and the admiral\r\nwith everybody, including, it may be, his own self.\r\n\r\nNobody was satisfied, which is indeed the invariable consequence of\r\nweakness, for the love of vulgar popularity was the weakness of our\r\neminent chief, so deeply respected on other accounts. This same\r\nweakness caused him to end his days as a Deputy of the most colourless\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nI cruised for six months outside the Dardanelles, first with the Iena\r\nand afterwards with the Belle-Poule, which had joined the squadron and\r\nof which I had been given command--six months which offered nothing in\r\nthe way of wild gaiety, beyond the routine of my duty. True, we saw the\r\nsun rise over Mount Ida every morning, but we never saw the shadow of a\r\ngoddess. The utmost we did in the short breathing spaces between our\r\ndrills and cruises between Cape Baba and the Isles of Tenedos, Lemnos\r\nand Imbro, was to land at the slaughter-house of the contractor to the\r\nsquadron, irreverently styled Charognopolis, for an excursion to the\r\nruins of Troy, to shoot snipe in the marshes of Simois, or get a hare\r\non the tomb of Patroclus.\r\n\r\nThis monotony was broken, however, by the appearance of the Turkish\r\nfleet, which we saw issuing, forty strong, from the Dardanelles,\r\nsailing along in confusion, driving before a strong breeze--altogether\r\na most stately sight.\r\n\r\nWe took station abreast of the squadron, saluting the Capitan Pasha,\r\nwho on his side ordered his fleet to heave to--a manoeuvre which was\r\nperformed amid a fine confusion. A steam launch at once came towards\r\nus. It bore the second in command of the fleet, Osman Pasha, sent by\r\nthe Capitan Pasha to request an interview with Admiral Lalande. He\r\nconsented and boarded the Turkish ship, taking me with him.\r\n\r\nDuring our passage to the Capitan Pasha's flag-ship, Osman Pasha led us\r\nbelow, closed all the cabin doors with an air of mystery, and with the\r\nhelp of a young Armenian dragoman he told us a long story, which I will\r\nsum up in a few words. Constantinople, so he said, was being laid waste\r\nby fire and sword. On the death of Sultan Mahmoud, Kosrew Pasha, who\r\nwas no better than a Russian agent, had seized the reins of power. He\r\nstuck at nothing, so long as he kept them. The real Turks, the faithful\r\nMussulmans, were losing their heads by the hundred; the head of the\r\nfaith himself, the Sheik el Islam, had not been spared. He refused to\r\nconsecrate the new Sultan until he wore the venerated turban of Othman\r\nupon his head instead of the revolutionary fez, and for this he was\r\nstrangled at midnight, with great pomp it is true, and amid the salvos\r\nof artillery due to his exalted rank (a poor consolation, I thought to\r\nmyself!). The lives of Osman Pasha himself and of his chief, the\r\nCapitan Pasha, hung by a thread. Wherefore they had both resolved,\r\ninstead of fighting against Mehemet Ali, as everybody believed they\r\nwould, to make common cause with him, so as to unite all the Mussulman\r\nstrength in one single alliance, and make one of those concentrated\r\nefforts which have been the dream of every period and every country\r\nwhich has been torn by revolution. In plain English, the two chiefs in\r\ncommand were carrying the unconscious fleet into an act of defection\r\nwhich was intended to save their own heads. They wanted the admiral's\r\napprobation, which he refused. Then they asked for a French warship to\r\ngo with them as a sort of lifeboat, which he promised them, and above\r\nall, they begged that no word, glance, or gesture of ours, during the\r\nvisit we were about to pay, might betray the secret confided to us. We\r\nthen boarded the Capitan Pasha's flagship, where we had a reception\r\nthat was truly oriental in its mingled pomp and duplicity--we alone,\r\namidst the crowd of courtiers, officers, and foreign representatives\r\nsurrounding this commander-in-chief, about to turn traitor, being\r\npossessed of his secret. Not to mention that as we went along the gun\r\ndecks, we saw the Turkish gunners smoking their pipes beside the heaps\r\nof cartridges piled between the guns. A highly oriental sight also, and\r\nfar from tranquillizing!\r\n\r\nBy evening the Turkish fleet had disappeared over the horizon, and the\r\nonly other recollection my memory holds of this period is that of a\r\nreconnaissance along the northern coast of the Dardanelles, and the\r\npeninsula between Gallipoli and the Gulf of Saron, which reconnaissance\r\nI made with several other officers, under colour of a sporting\r\nexpedition in a Turkish boat called a sakoleve and with a view to an\r\nultimate military occupation of the peninsula. Mayhap the notes made\r\nduring this expedition were of use when Gallipoli was occupied in 1854,\r\nat the beginning of the Crimean War.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the autumn, I beheld Constantinople, that most\r\nwonderful of landscapes, for the first time in my life. And to begin\r\nwith, the thing which struck me most were the sunsets over the huge\r\ncity. Nothing can give any idea of how magnificent they are, with the\r\ntowers and thousand mosques of Stamboul standing out like a mysterious\r\nvision in the misty golden haze, an enchanted city of aerial palaces\r\nhanging in mid-air. In those days the soft evening mists I speak of\r\nwere ideal in their transparence, which no smoke ever dimmed, for the\r\nfactories and steamboats which now hang their black plumes over\r\nConstantinople were then unknown. Instead of steamers, there were only\r\nthose delightful caiques, laden with brightly-dressed passengers,\r\ngliding silently along in their thousands, and leaving as it were\r\ntracks of glistening spangles in their wake. Nothing can ever efface\r\nthat sight from my recollection.\r\n\r\nAmong the caiques, which are quite peculiar to the Bosphorus, was one I\r\nmet many a time, and which was indeed well known to everybody. It\r\nbelonged to a sister of the late Sultan Mahmoud, celebrated in\r\nConstantinople for her love affairs--a sort of Marguerite de Bourbon,\r\nfor whose fleeting favours several people had paid with their heads.\r\nThree oarsmen, splendid white-skinned fellows with long fair\r\nmoustaches, and athletic frames scarcely concealed beneath their white\r\ndrawers and striped silk gauze shirts, sent their mistress's caique\r\nflying through the water. She was a tall woman, with piercing eyes and\r\nan aristocratic air--always seated between two lovely maids of honour.\r\nI say lovely, for the Turkish woman, when she is unobserved, when she\r\nknows her own beauty and meets eyes whose admiration she desires to\r\nrouse, always finds means of permitting her veil the most delightful if\r\nindiscreet revelations. Consequently I was always on the look-out to\r\ntry and get a sight of the Sultana's caique. It must be remembered I\r\nwas just off a cruise after long months spent in warlike solitude on\r\nboard ship. So, though St. Sophia, with its size and its legend, had\r\nstruck me as being the most profoundly devotional edifice I had ever\r\nseen--an impression which the sight of St. Peter's at Rome and of the\r\nCathedral of Seville has never removed--my attention and curiosity were\r\nmuch more drawn to the earthly representatives of the houris promised\r\nto the faithful, than to the monuments of the Faith.\r\n\r\nThe curiosity I speak of led me on a certain Friday to the Sweet Waters\r\nof Asia. I found the loveliest of scenes lying before my eyes that\r\ndelicious afternoon towards the end of August. Imagine an immense\r\nmeadow, broken up by clumps of trees, sloping down to the swift blue\r\nwaters of the Bosphorus, on the other side of which ran wooded hills\r\ndotted with mosques and minarets and gaily painted country houses.\r\nClose to the edge of the water stands a kiosk, and an elegantly-carved\r\nmarble fountain. And around the kiosk is a sort of promenade shaded by\r\nhuge plane-trees. Under these plane-trees a hundred, or thereabouts,\r\ngaily adorned and plumed arabas, now standing unharnessed in the\r\nmeadow, had deposited an army of the smartest Turkish ladies. Some of\r\nthem sat beside the water, others round the fountain, others again\r\nfollowed little pashas mounted on ponies led by eunuchs. What with the\r\nrichness of the landscape, the truly oriental light, and the variety\r\nand splendour of the dresses, the whole sight was really fairy-like. We\r\nwere very desirous of studying it in detail, and at close quarters. A\r\nline of soldiers cut off the portion of the grove of plane-trees\r\nreserved to women only. But our ambassadress and her daughters, who had\r\ncome at the same time as ourselves, had a right to enter it, and we\r\nhurried after them. At first the officer commanding the guard tried to\r\nstop us. However, after a colloquy with the dragoman of our Embassy, he\r\ncontented himself with begging us to go through quickly. The ladies of\r\nthe Embassy having seated themselves among the Turkish ladies, we did\r\nlikewise, and, in spite of the angry glances of the eunuchs, by dint of\r\nmutual curiosity and a little flirtation we spent several hours quite\r\ndelightfully. Lots of pretty women, and forbidden fruit into the\r\nbargain. No more veils, no more feredjes. We could scrutinize the\r\nexquisite costumes at our leisure.\r\n\r\nWhen I say \"No more veils\" I ought rather to say nothing but an excuse\r\nfor a veil--a gauze chin covering leaving nose and eyes and eyebrows\r\nbare, and so transparent across the mouth, that where that mouth was a\r\npretty one, to cover it at all was but an extra piece of coquetry.\r\n\r\nAll these women were chatting, eating, amusing themselves, some\r\nsitting, some lying down, going and coming, hanging about near the\r\nladies of the Embassy, to examine the details of their dresses too. If\r\ninstantaneous photography had existed in those days, what an infinity\r\nof charming and picturesque groups might have been snatched. I did\r\nventure to make one or two rapid sketches on the sly; but there were\r\ntoo many eyes upon me, and besides it was an abuse of the toleration\r\nwhich was being shown us. I could not tear myself away from this most\r\nexceptional sight, which will never be seen again, now the Turkish\r\nladies have adopted European fashions--boots and petticoats, and stays,\r\ndeceiving stays!\r\n\r\nBut every good thing comes to an end, and besides, as the day wore on,\r\na great cloud of smoke rose over Constantinople, and steadily increased\r\nin volume. It was evidently a fire. In that country, where all the\r\nbuildings except the mosques and a house here and there are wooden--a\r\nfire is a terribly serious thing. Was it Stamboul, or was it Pera, and\r\nwith Pera our hotel, that was blazing? Carried along by the sinewy\r\nstrokes of our caiqchis, and aided by the current, we went swiftly down\r\nthe Bosphorus, landed at Dolma-Batche, and rapidly climbed the Cemetery\r\nHill. Thence I saw a striking sight. The whole quarter below, called\r\nKassim Pasha, lying between Pera and Galata, was in flames. Over three\r\nhundred houses were sparks, already burnt out. The wooden houses,\r\nkindled by falling crackled like faggots, and we could see the\r\nconflagration spreading like a spot of oil. Fifty houses away from\r\nthose actually on fire, people were turning out, throwing doors and\r\nwindows and furniture into the streets, without warning of any kind.\r\nDrawing nearer the scene of the fire, we came upon a troop of\r\nvile-looking fellows, the rioters of our country, grafted onto the\r\nMussulman fanatic--kavasses were raining blows with their sticks on\r\nthis crowd of volunteers (or thieves); firemen, bare-armed and\r\nturbanless, hurried along, with their fire pumps on their shoulders,\r\nshouting shrilly and knocking over people as they went; troops kept\r\ncoming up from all quarters, horsemen trotted up at full speed, and\r\npacks of terrified dogs tore wildly through the streets, howling with\r\npain. It was a singular sight indeed.\r\n\r\nSeeing the flames kept gaining ground, and were already licking the\r\nfirst houses in the European quarter in Pera, I sent orders for the\r\ncrews of two of our ships, anchored at Tophana, to land, slipped on my\r\nuniform, and put myself at their head, resolved to try and save the\r\nFrank town. Luckily it was calm, or the attempt would have been quite\r\nhopeless. But the sun had set red, and that presaged wind. There was no\r\ntime to be lost. I hurried up with a hundred and fifty sailors. The\r\nfirst houses on each side of the street of Pera were in flames, but a\r\nspot was pointed out to me, twelve or fifteen houses off, where, the\r\nstreet narrowing between a stone mosque and some gardens, one might\r\nhope to clear a space to stop the fire, by pulling down the five or six\r\nintervening houses. I had no hesitation in giving the order for this,\r\nmy men set eagerly to work, and all the active portion of the Frank\r\npopulation of Pera were seconding our efforts, when one of the generals\r\nof the garrison, Selim Pasha, came up with his men, and fell into a\r\nfury at the sight of what we were doing. I forthwith seized him by the\r\nhand and dragged him, the dragoman of the Embassy, M. Lauxerrois,\r\nfollowing us, to the top of the minaret of the mosque. Here I said to\r\nthe dragoman, \"Do show this fool of a pasha that the clearing we are\r\nmaking is our only chance of saving Pera;\" and as M. Lauxerrois began\r\nto translate this into Turkish, \"Don't trouble,\" said Selim Pasha, in\r\nvery good French, \"I understand.\" I begged his pardon for the epithet,\r\nbut he had passed suddenly already from rage to enthusiasm. He tore\r\ndown stairs four steps at a time, and I shortly saw him without his\r\ncoat, in trousers and list braces, helping us to pull down the houses,\r\nand setting an example of the utmost activity to his own men.\r\n\r\nDown came the houses, one after the other. Our sailors behaved\r\nsplendidly. They climbed up on to the roofs and fastened ropes, to\r\nwhich we harnessed the whole of the population, while the frameworks\r\nwere being sawn through below till the whole thing came down with a\r\ncrash. Indeed I saw one house come down with five or six sailors\r\nperched on its roof. I rushed forward in horror, thinking they must all\r\nbe maimed or killed. Not a bit of it! Only a few hands and feet torn by\r\nnails! Truly God watches over the brave! The fall of one Turkish house\r\ncaused a pretty scene! The proprietor was determined to prevent it. He\r\nstruck and swore at us,--pulling out his beard. The anticipation of the\r\ndestruction of his property drove him wild. Finding nobody paid any\r\nattention to him, he called his women folk to his assistance. They\r\nhastened up like furies, at first. Then, changing their tactics, they\r\ncast themselves on my officers, clasping them in their arms, covering\r\nthem with kisses and caresses, and trying \"the power of their charms on\r\nthem in every imaginable way. It was a curious sight truly to watch by\r\nthe light of the flames, and amidst such a cacophony of races, a\r\nhandful of sailors stopping the passers-by, Turks as well as the rest,\r\nsetting them to work, snatching the fire-pumps from the firemen,\r\ncarrying soldiers and generals too along with them, and in fact ruling\r\nthe roast in the very middle of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nAt last, thanks to the fire-pump and thanks to our own selves, the fire\r\nstopped just where we had fought it. I went off then towards the\r\ncemetery, where it was still burning, and where the sight was most\r\nsingular. An immense crowd of people, the whole population of the\r\nburnt-out quarters of the town, in every imaginable costume, and silent\r\nlike true fatalists, herded on the hill and the plateau, together with\r\nwhatever had been saved out of the disaster. Under the red light of the\r\nconflagration, the flames of which shot up in great jets into the\r\nskies, the huge bivouac made a splendid picture, reminding one of the\r\nworks of the English painter Martyn, the Last Judgment, Belshezzar's\r\nFeast, and so forth. Stamboul, with her forest of minarets and her\r\nthousands of lights, stood out on the horizon against a lovely starry\r\nsky, and in the foreground the Seraskier sat in a big armchair,\r\nsurrounded by an immense staff, seeming very philosophically resigned\r\nto the catastrophe over which he appeared to be presiding. In one hand\r\nhe held his pipe, and in the other a slice of melon. We were already\r\nwell acquainted, and when he saw me coming up, all blackened with smoke\r\nand ashes, he roared with laughter. But he gave me a slice of his\r\nmelon, and very grateful it was to my parched throat.\r\n\r\nThe fire was under control--that is to say, there was only one block of\r\nhouses left burning, and this had no communication with either Galata\r\nor Pera. But the disaster was a great one. Over fifteen hundred houses\r\nhad been burnt. The exact number was never known. First because nobody\r\ncounted them--that would have been quite contrary to oriental\r\nindifference and fatalism--and then because it would have been\r\nexcessively difficult to make them out, in the confused ash heap which\r\nhad taken their place. The number of families reduced to destitution\r\nmust have been very considerable, but individual charity is very\r\nliberal amongst the Mussulmans, as indeed amongst all people possessed\r\nof religious faith. I got home, at one o'clock in the morning, worn\r\nout. Shortly afterwards the wind rose. If it had begun to blow a little\r\nearlier, nothing would have remained of Pera, of the Frankish town, nor\r\nof the Embassies.\r\n\r\nA very few days had gone by when I was bidden to quite a different sort\r\nof entertainment. After the disease of adopting the Gentile's trousers\r\nand frock-coat, yet another disease seized upon Turkey--that of having\r\na constitution in imitation of the constitutions in vogue amongst the\r\nGiaours, and the Sultan had the kindness to ask me to see one\r\nproclaimed. Concerning the constitution itself, which bore the\r\naltogether Turkish name of \"Hatti Schereef de Gulhane,\" I will say\r\nnothing. First of all because I never read it, and secondly because I\r\nhave been told it was \"liberal,\" that is to say, fitted, like M.\r\nPrudhomme's sword, to organize government, and if necessary to destroy\r\nit, this last more frequently--and that is quite enough for me. But the\r\nproclamation ceremony was likely to be curious. So on the appointed day\r\nI started forth in full uniform, to be present at it. It was to take\r\nplace within the Seraglio. The first incident in the day was that my\r\nboat met the Russian Minister's caique at the landing-stage, and as\r\nneither of our coxswains would yield to the other there was an awful\r\nbump, which damaged the dignity of our attitudes by knocking us down\r\nlike card houses. Then we had to ride rather frisky horses in Turkish\r\nsaddles, and this, what with our cocked hats, dangling swords, and\r\nunstrapped trousers, was yet another trial to the dignity of some of my\r\nsailor comrades. Nevertheless, we got without hindrance to a kiosk, the\r\nupper story of which was to be occupied by the Sultan and his harem,\r\nand the lower by the diplomatic corps. A special window had been\r\nreserved for me. Bands began to play, loud shouts were heard. The\r\nSultan was coming, on horseback, preceded by a crowd of officers and\r\npashas, in full dress. Between him and them, dressed in a sort of blue\r\nblouse with epaulettes, hobbled a little lame man with a big red head,\r\na white beard, and a spiteful-looking face. It was Kosrew Pasha, the\r\nGrand Vizier, he who had caused so many heads to fall, the strangler of\r\nthe Sheik el Islam. He bowed low several times as he passed me. After\r\nhim came the Sultan's pages, handsome young fellows, carrying halberts\r\nand wearing gilt shakos with immense plumes of peacocks' feathers,\r\naigrettes, or birds of Paradise. In the centre of them was the Sultan\r\nhimself, almost hidden by their plumes. He kept his head thrown back\r\nand wore a black cloak trimmed with diamonds and a fez with an aigrette\r\nadorned with the same stones. He dismounted. The Grand Vizier and the\r\nnew Sheik el Islam held up the corners of his cloak, while a hideous\r\nnegro, with hanging lips and haunches like a woman, covered with\r\nembroideries, advanced to receive him. This was Kislar Aga, chief\r\neunuch and governor of the harem.\r\n\r\nAnd now everybody has come, \"Let the sport begin.\" From my window I\r\nlook out on a broad space, surrounded by beautiful umbrella pines and\r\nsloping gently down to the sea. Beyond is the Asiatic shore of the\r\nBosphorus and the pretty village of Kadi-Keni. This space is full of\r\ntroops, twelve splendid battalions of the Imperial Guard, Lancers and\r\nArtillery. These form a circle, in the centre of which rises a pulpit\r\ncovered with some yellow stuff, and around it the pashas and the whole\r\nbody of Ulemas and Mollahs, wearing the ancient costume--coloured\r\nkaftans, and big white or green turbans crossed with broad gold\r\nbands--shortly collect. The chief dervishes and the heads of all the\r\nreligious sects are there also. All this clergy stands there\r\nmotionless, impassive, with lowered eyes, not over pleased, I fancy, at\r\nbottom. Then the crowd makes a rush, which infuriates the Grand Vizier.\r\nHe makes towards it, lifting his little leg very high and waving his\r\nhandkerchief. At the very sight of him everybody flees, and retires\r\nhumbly within bounds. Then the manuscript of the Hatti-Schereef is\r\nbrought to him. He carries it respectfully to his lips and forehead,\r\nand hands it over to Reschid Pasha, who ascends the pulpit and reads it\r\nout. That over and finished midst the deepest silence, an Imaum takes\r\nReschid Pasha's place in the pulpit. He stretches out his arms. All\r\npresent do the same, the soldiers stretching out but one on account of\r\ntheir weapons, and he intones the prayer for the Sultan, which every\r\none repeats in chorus. After which every man passes his hand across his\r\neyes and beard and the troops shout \"Allah\" three times, with\r\nunequalled fervour and passion. Hundreds of cannon are fired in all\r\ndirections, and the beautiful sight, lighted up by the most brilliant\r\nof sunshine, has come to an end. The Sultan has departed. The Sultana\r\nValide sends me a posse of officials, bearing cakes and sweetmeats. I\r\ntake leave of Kosrew Pasha and depart also, thinking sadly that if this\r\nTurkish people, so brave on the field of battle and apparently still so\r\ndevoted to its sovereign, and so firm in its religious faith, is truly,\r\nin spite of all, a rapidly decaying nation, the miserable rag of paper\r\nread out this day will certainly not save it.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan gave me an uninteresting audience in the pretty Top-Kapou\r\nPalace--now burnt down, I believe--which stood on the extreme end of\r\nthe Seraglio point. I had visited the palace, which was then\r\nunoccupied, with a very witty Pasha who spoke French admirably\r\nwell--and whom I had known in Paris--Namick Pasha, commander of the\r\nImperial Guard. We had gone over all the rooms in the harem, and this\r\nvisit, with the explanations and commentaries given me by such a guide,\r\nhad been most interesting. One room was a perfect gem, and I cannot\r\nresist the pleasure of describing it. It was very large, circular, the\r\nfloor covered with very fine matting. All round it was a little raised\r\nplatform, covered with divans. The walls were entirely formed of great\r\nmirrors, in splendid rococo frames of carved wood, gilt. It was\r\nevidently the room in which the harem festivals were held. Between the\r\nmirrors were eight little doors, every one leading to a small apartment\r\nfor one woman, fitted with mirrors and divans and each hung with a\r\ndifferent stuff. To complete the whole thing, there was a passage\r\nleading to a bath-house, consisting of several very pretty marble\r\nbath-rooms. The master of all this must have had a good time! All sorts\r\nof details were given me while I was there. The Sultan had no\r\nlegitimate wives except those who bear children--so the competition may\r\nbe imagined. Mahmoud had had thirty-five children, but only five were\r\nleft, two sons and three daughters. The rest had died in infancy. The\r\nactual Sultan, Abdul-Medjid, who was very young at the time of my\r\nvisit, had only one wife with child, but his mother, the Sultana\r\nValide, had just presented him with six young ladies, said to be\r\ncharming, as an encouragement. Besides this, every year, at the Feast\r\nof Bairam, the Sheik el Islam gives the Sultan a beautiful slave to\r\nwhom he is compelled by the Law and the Prophet to give proofs of his\r\naffection, that very day, on pain of incurring the wrath of Allah. Only\r\nnobody knows whether Allah, up in his celestial home, has reason to be\r\npleased or not.\r\n\r\nHaving still a few spare days before I rejoined the squadron, I took\r\nadvantage of an Austrian steamer to cross the Black Sea as far as\r\nTrebizond, whence I gazed admiringly on the splendid chain of the snowy\r\nCaucasian peaks. I should much have liked to get as far as Erzeroum, in\r\nthe heart of Asia Minor. But as time failed me I contented myself with\r\ntravelling at full speed for one day, along the road leading thither,\r\nwith the Tartar or postman who carried the mails, so as to obtain some\r\nidea of the country. When I say road I speak figuratively. It was not\r\neven a path. It was a mere track across the woods and rocks and ravines\r\nof that mountainous region, but along that track the Tartar galloped\r\nimperturbably, never stopping however terrible the ground might be.\r\nWhen the post-carrying experience was over, my comrades and I were more\r\ndone up than we had ever been in our lives. The least weary of the\r\nparty was the son of our consul at Trebizond, Maxime Outrey, a charming\r\nlad, brought up and dressed a l'orientale, whom we had taken with us as\r\nour dragoman, and who vied with the Tartar in speed and boldness the\r\nwhole day long like one possessed. On the way back from Trebizond our\r\nsteamer was crammed with passengers coming from every corner of Asia,\r\nthe strangest medley of Circassians, Persians, and cat merchants, and\r\none pasha. I bought a splendid Angora during the passage, and the pasha\r\nbought himself a wife. The whole of the negotiations for the latter\r\nacquisition, the discussions, the examination and verification of the\r\nmerchandize, took place in our cabin, and very amusing it was. The\r\nyoung lady belonged to a Tcherkess family which had eluded the Russian\r\ncruisers, and come alongside of us at Trebizond in big boats with\r\ntriangular sails, spotted like a tiger's hide. The head of the family,\r\na tall old man, was going to Mecca, to seek a cure there for the\r\nhorrible agony caused by a Russian bullet which was still in his head.\r\nHis sons, handsome fellows in splendid costumes, with fine features and\r\nshoulders broad out of all proportion to waists that were like girls',\r\nwere going with him. There were a dozen women besides, and do you know,\r\nmy reader, what that pack of women was? Letters of credit, bank notes,\r\nby means of which the old man with his wound expected to pay the\r\nexpenses of his journey! Having no cash, he had brought the twelve\r\nbest-looking girls in his family with him. He had just disposed of one\r\non board, and he reckoned on doing the same with the rest all along the\r\nroad. We soon made the acquaintance of the party. The girls were\r\nhuddled together on deck in a sort of cage or trelliswork, where they\r\nremained, drenched by the sea, four days and three nights, without\r\ntheir chatter and their outbursts of merriment ever ceasing for a\r\nsingle instant. They all dreamt of becoming the wives of sultans or\r\npashas and of living in palaces. As the old man fed them with nothing\r\nbut millet, to fatten them, we used to bring them our dessert after\r\neach meal, and so we were soon good friends. Thanks to some trifling\r\nservice I rendered the old man, he consented to bringing the prettiest\r\ngirl into my cabin, and allowing her to unveil, so that I might do her\r\npicture. I thought the model and her costume both equally lovely, but\r\nthe sitting was a very short one. Whether it was shyness or\r\nsea-sickness I know not. But she complained of the heat, began to cry,\r\nand I had to send her away.\r\n\r\nI merely passed through Constantinople on my way back. It was the\r\nmiddle of Ramadan, all the mosques lighted up at night, and the women\r\npromenading in the square of the Seraskier in the daytime--a regular\r\npersil. I went there one day with Paul Daru, Lavalette and Cyrus\r\nGerard, all members of the embassy M. de Sercey was taking to Persia.\r\nThey came from Paris and told me the news from there. In my turn I told\r\nthem all about the battle of Nezib, a very interesting description of\r\nwhich I had had the good luck to hear from two young Prussian officers,\r\neye-witnesses of it, one of whom became the celebrated Marshal von\r\nMoltke; and also all I learnt about the Eastern question on my visits\r\nto the Embassies, to Therapia and Buyukdere. There I had met all the\r\nchief members of the diplomatic corps, which consisted during my stay\r\nof two French ambassadors, succeeding each other, both of them\r\ninstability personified--one was Admiral Roussin, a distinguished\r\nsailor, the other M. de Pontois, a professional diplomat--both of them\r\nvery kind, but neither, as a result of their instability, having any\r\nreal influence. Beside them two men of tenacity and steadfastness\r\nadmirably personified two great powers. Lord Ponsonby, a tall, blunt,\r\nhaughty, unsociable old man, represented British perseverance and Lord\r\nPalmerston's prejudices, while M. de Boutenieff, a charming, kindly,\r\nand witty man, liked by everybody and making game somewhat of all,\r\nstood for the great destinies of the Russian people, and the mighty\r\nwill of the Emperor Nicholas. An armed Russian intervention in the\r\nBosphorus was no longer in question, but it was unforeseen as yet that\r\nRussia and England would agree to ruin the work of Mehemet Ali, the\r\nlast strength in reality of the Mussulman world, and that the whole of\r\nEurope would join these two powers in their willing alliance for the\r\nisolation and humiliation of France, revolutionary France! No more\r\nallies for us, since we have gone into that mill! We sacrificed 200,000\r\nmen in the Crimea. What did we get by it? The garter for Napoleon III.\r\nOne word or deed of sympathy for all our reverses? Not the shadow of\r\none! Revolutionary France has been asked for help. But none has ever\r\nbeen given her. Would it be rendered her now? God grant it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n1840-1841\r\n\r\n\r\nI left Constantinople with a farewell glance, full of pleasant\r\nmemories, over its forest of minarets, over the Bosphorus and the\r\nsmiling Princes Islands, and at the snowy peak too of Mount Olympus,\r\nwhich, with my taste for mountaineering, I had climbed but a short time\r\npreviously. An interesting ascent it had been, first of all through\r\nthat Eastern Switzerland around the pretty town of Broussa, and then\r\nover the snow and rocky debris to the summit, whence a matchless\r\npanorama is to be seen. The squadrons, one French and one English,\r\nforming a strong force of ships, were at that time on guard at the\r\nmouth of the Dardanelles. I went back to my duty in ours, which was\r\nstill as active and incessantly drilled as ever. The English squadron,\r\ncommanded by Sir Robert Stopford, a handsome white-haired old man, was\r\nless restless. But the fleets dispersed before long. Ours sailed for\r\nSmyrna, whence the Admiral sent the Belle-Poule under my command, and\r\nthe Triton, Captain Hamelin, back to France. We sailed in company, and\r\nafter a somewhat lengthy winter passage, we got to Toulon only to find\r\nourselves put into thirty-five days of quarantine. Five and thirty days\r\nof prison and solitude and uselessness imposed on a crew without a\r\nsingle sick man, which was daily inspected by its officers as to\r\ncleanliness, whose health was looked after by three doctors, and which\r\nhad just gone through the best and safest of purifying operations--a\r\nlong sea voyage. Five and thirty days during which 400 men ate and\r\ndrank and lived at the expense of the National Budget without doing the\r\nsmallest work for the country--the whole thing inflicted by the\r\nSanitary Board--a purely local and irresponsible body, with its eternal\r\nround of red tape. A good thing it is indeed that such a monstrous and\r\nintolerable abuse should have been abolished! The only reason it lasted\r\nso long is, that it brought in a revenue to the members of the board.\r\nTo begin with, they filled the inn they kept under the title of\r\n\"Lazaretto\" by force, and then they sold the disinfectants.\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" the sanitary officer would say, with his provencal\r\naccent--\"Nous allons faire le parfum.\" The crew were shut up below, the\r\nofficer lighted a sort of pastille which made a great smoke, everybody\r\npretended to sneeze at once ... and we were disinfected! The farce was\r\nover! There was a great dinner too, which the board gave itself at\r\nSaint Roch, at the expense of the persons in quarantine, which put the\r\nfinishing touch to the scandal. Wherefore, during my own detention, I\r\nalways had the band on deck as soon as the boat belonging to the board\r\nappeared in the port, and greeted it with the most horrible and\r\ndiscordant of music. Further, I asked guilelessly for leave to carry on\r\nmy ship's firing drill in the Lazaretto Bay, and I took care to open\r\nfire so close to the Lazaretto itself that I heard all the glass in the\r\nwindows fall out with a crash. As I expected, I was forbidden to do it\r\nagain, the board being furious, and having lodged a complaint, stating\r\nthat I used bad cartridges, but I had a delicious moment of vengeance\r\nall the same.\r\n\r\nThe quarantine came to an end at last, I was given leave, and once\r\nmore, with joy, beheld my family, and Paris too. I had spent the\r\ngreater part of my existence for the past four years at sea, and I\r\nconfess I thirsted somewhat for Paris, dear unrivalled Paris! I got\r\nthere in the heart of the winter of 1839, and left it in the first days\r\nof June of the same year. What recollections have I of those four\r\nmonths of repose? In vain I tax my memory, I can find nothing, or\r\nhardly anything at all. As far as exterior events go, none but the most\r\ninfinitesimally small--the eternal wearying struggle between ministers\r\nin esse and in posse, which left the bulk of the public exceedingly\r\nindifferent. If the situation from the external point of view had grown\r\nmore serious, at all events it did not inspire anxiety. The strength of\r\nthe monarchical principle still made itself felt, in spite of the hitch\r\nin 1830. People reckoned on the King, on his wisdom and farsighted\r\npatriotism, to ward off the dangers, present and future, with which the\r\nambition of the permanent and persevering governments around us\r\nthreaten us, but of which our short-sighted democracy takes so little\r\naccount. The King was indeed shortly to justify this confidence by\r\nsaving France from a war with a European coalition, about the Eastern\r\nquestion--a war into which we were being led by the imprudence of M.\r\nThiers and the bragging of our press and which could have ended in\r\nnothing but disaster.\r\n\r\nThe governmental machine worked meanwhile, as a whole, with tolerable\r\nsmoothness. The House of Peers, the members of which were permanent,\r\nand therefore strangers to electoral compromise, discussed with weight\r\nand authority laws which were really progressive, respecting as they\r\ndid the interests and liberties of all concerned; while the Chamber of\r\nDeputies, consisting of unpaid members, voted with much more care for\r\nthe public weal than is possible in an assembly of men enslaved by\r\ntheir election committees, and perpetually haunted by the nightmare of\r\nre-election. An independent magistracy, according to President\r\nSeguier's fine expression, gave sentences, not services, \"rendait des\r\narrets, et non pas des services\" while the administration, which was\r\nalmost as permanent as the magistracy, had time to do good work and did\r\nit. In short, except for the criminal classes, and those incorrigible\r\nrevolutionists who ask perpetually for the impossible, everybody felt\r\nthat his security, his liberty, and his faith, were well protected,\r\nand, as I heard said on all sides when I came back from my voyages,\r\npeople felt they were well governed. It is true that if I opened the\r\nnewspapers I generally read to the contrary in them--but if there were\r\nsome few serious organs of public opinion among these journals, edited\r\nby courageous and talented men, who did their best to serve their\r\ncountry by their writings, whatever their opinions might be, how many\r\nmore had editors who were mere slander-mongers, and columns all the\r\nmore eagerly read, the more calumnious they were, and the more they\r\npandered to every envious and subversive passion. Such men were the\r\nspokesmen of that increasingly numerous class of speculators, who\r\nrelinquish any useful career to seek fortune in the chances of\r\npolitics. According to them, oppression and corruption had grown\r\nintolerable, and would never cease until power passed into their own\r\nimmaculate hands. They alone possessed the secret for turning France\r\ninto a terrestrial Paradise, by applying in all SINCERITY the great and\r\nhigh-sounding principles, liberty, equality and fraternity. This\r\nSINCERITY of application, which has been so frequently announced,\r\ndallies somewhat in its coming, especially as regards equality, which\r\nto so many people merely means, \"That which I have not nobody else\r\nshall have.\" The word equality is seductive truly, and in every\r\nself-respecting community equality before the law must be utterly\r\nabsolute for all men. But so long as science discovers no means for\r\nmaking all men equally intelligent and all women equally beautiful, I\r\nshall continue to look upon universal and blind equality as the most\r\nabsurd and the most dangerous of chimeras. These reflections did not\r\noccur to me at the period I speak of. I was far too careless in the\r\nyear 1840 to bother my head about the conundrums set by our\r\noffice-seekers, \"place-hunters\" as the Americans call them. While they\r\nwere amusing themselves with the fancies, envious, irreligious,\r\nunhealthy, and above all self-interested, which they posed as deducing\r\nfrom the principles of 1789, a far more terrible revolution than the\r\nFrench one--for it was to strike the poor as well as the rich--was\r\nshortly to burst upon us; the revolution brought about by the use of\r\nsteam and electricity and rapidity of communication. Few people in\r\nthose days foresaw the complete subversion of all the conditions of\r\nlabour and food supply and life itself, which was to overtake all the\r\npeoples gathered together in old-established communities on worn-out\r\nsoil, a subversion which is only in its beginning as yet, and the\r\nremedy for which we cannot discover.\r\n\r\nOne of the first results of the use of steam was to make it essential\r\nfor all nations having war fleets to transform their arsenals and their\r\nnaval stores. It was absolutely necessary to be able to oppose an\r\nenemy, whose means of attack could overcome wind and tide, with\r\ndefensive means of equal power. That was as clear as A B C. This\r\ntransformation interested me keenly--for the future of the arm of the\r\nservice to which I had fervently devoted my whole life, and which I\r\ndesired to see become once more a redoubtable weapon of our country's\r\npower, was bound up with it. But, to carry it through, we had to war\r\nwith routine, with the obstinacy bred of old habit, and with the narrow\r\nideas which were taught in the naval schools. It was a continuous daily\r\nstruggle in which I bore an assiduous part.\r\n\r\nApart from this naval question, my time was spent between my home life,\r\nmy worship for the fine arts, and the theatre, and also in\r\nboar-hunting, of which I grew passionately fond; and what makes this\r\ncurious is that before I tried it I scorned the idea to such an extent\r\nthat my brothers tied me up and took me by force the first time. Every\r\nincident of the hunt, the attack, the pursuit, all the unforeseen\r\noccurrences of the chase, leading you nobody knows whither, so that you\r\neven lose yourself in the dark sometimes in strange places, has still\r\nall the charm of struggle and action to me. And what a pleasant party\r\nof sportsmen we used to be, during our visits to Compiegne, to\r\nChantilly, and above all to Fontainebleau! My brothers and I, the two\r\nGreffuhles, Caumont, Morny, Valewski, Edgard Ney, La Rochette, Casimir\r\nPerier, d'Albufera, Wagram, the de l'Aigles; foreigners too, Bedmar,\r\nd'Ossuna--and officers--and some ladies,--amongst these the beautiful\r\nDuchess of Somerset, who always hunted in a mask, and was invariably\r\nescorted by the charming Prince Labanoff. There were painters too\r\namongst the most assiduous sportsmen--Jadin and Decamps. Decamps, of\r\nwhom I was a fanatical admirer, was just in his best period--so too\r\nwere Delacroix and M. Ingres; and all that pleiad of great artists,\r\nyoung then and in the full flush of their powers--Leopold Robert,\r\nHorace Vernet, Delaroche, my own master Ary Scheffer, Flandrin, and the\r\nlandscape painters Marilhat and Corot--this last, in his first manner,\r\ndry and rectilinear, like that of Poussin. Nobody nowadays has any idea\r\nof the eager discussions aroused by the opening of the Salon and the\r\nsuperior merit of such a picture or statue. Nobody was indifferent:\r\neverybody was either for or against; each man either attacked the\r\nartist or lauded him to the skies. Works of art bring more money now,\r\naccording as they are produced by this man or that, but they are less\r\ndiscussed. Which is the best inspiration for an artist, money or\r\npassion?\r\n\r\nThe theatres too, the Vaudeville, Varietes, Francais, the Opera, were\r\ndelightful. At the Vaudeville, which had migrated after the fire in the\r\nRue de Chartres to the Boulevard Bonne Nouvelle, Arnal, the inimitable,\r\nquaintest and cleverest of comic actors, was playing. At the Varietes\r\nthey were acting the Saltimbanques, a play every line of which has\r\npassed into proverbs, which all my generation have been repeating for\r\nthe last forty years. A woman of genius, Mademoiselle Rachel, had\r\nbrought back its long forgotten glory to the Theatre Francais. For my\r\npart I never saw anything so absolutely perfect on the stage. With\r\nhardly any gesture, simply by the play of her countenance, her\r\nexpressive glance, and the intonation of her voice, she expressed all\r\nthe passions with an intensity that affected all her audience. She had\r\na genius for dress and drapery. In her peplum she might have been taken\r\nfor an antique statue, and she knew how to endue herself with the most\r\nincomparable womanly charm in all her parts, even the most savage ones.\r\nIf she had committed murder you would have loved the murderess, and,\r\nstrangely enough, this extraordinary woman was never witty except with\r\nher pen.\r\n\r\nAs for the Opera, the production of the great composers who had made\r\nits glory some years before had ceased. Of that trio of wonderful\r\nartists, Nourrit, Levasseur, and Mdlle. Falcon, only one, Levasseur,\r\nremained. The art of music was taking a rest. To make amends for this,\r\nthe opera shone in ballet, fairy-like performances in which pantomime\r\nand trap-doors played as important a part as the actual dancing.\r\nNothing could have been more enchanting than the Diable Boiteux with\r\nits many and various tableaux and its dresses, and Fanny Elsler dancing\r\nthe \"cachucha,\" or the Sylphide or the Revolte du Serail with Taglioni.\r\nI saw my brother Nemours in great danger during a performance of this\r\nlast-named ballet. At a certain point the dancers, representing the\r\nrevoltees, armed themselves with bows and shot a cloud of arrows into\r\nthe wings. Now in the heat of action one of these arrows, launched with\r\nextraordinary vigour but uncertain aim by a charming young lady, one of\r\nthe principal dancers, Mcllle. Duvernay, stuck in the column which\r\nseparated the Royal Box in the old Le Pelletier house from that of the\r\nMarquis du Hallay, only a few inches from my brother's head. There was\r\nan exclamation from all parts of the house, great confusion on the\r\nstage and many comments made. But \"all's well that ends well.\" That\r\nhappy time of youth and carelessness and hunting and theatre-going was\r\nnot to last long. Two of my brothers started for Africa--Chartres (as\r\nwe always called our eldest brother the Due d'Orleans) was to take over\r\nthe command of a division in the column which, under the orders of\r\nMarshal Vallee, was to check the rising prestige of Abd el Kader for\r\never at the Mouzaia Pass. My younger brother Aumale, was to have the\r\nopportunity during this expedition of breaking his first lance right\r\nbrilliantly. I saw them depart with envy, and to add to my annoyance I\r\nshortly fell ill of a violent attack of measles. One day, as I lay in\r\nhigh fever, I saw my father appear followed by M. de Remusat, then\r\nMinister of the Interior. This unusual visit filled me with\r\nastonishment, and my surprise increased when my father said,\r\n\"Joinville, you are to go out to St. Helena and bring back Napoleon's\r\ncoffin.\" If I had not been in bed already I should have fallen down\r\nflat, and at the first blush I felt nowise flattered when I compared\r\nthe warlike campaign my brothers were on with the undertaker's job I\r\nwas being sent to perform in the other hemisphere. But I served my\r\ncountry and I had no right to discuss my orders. And there were two\r\nsides to the question, besides. Above Napoleon, the enemy of my house,\r\nthe murderer of the Duc d'Enghien, who at his fall had left that\r\ndangerous game of chance wherein the ignorant herd is so often the dupe\r\nof the political croupier--universal suffrage--as his legacy to ruined\r\nand dismembered France,--there was the matchless warrior whose genius,\r\neven in defeat, had shed immortal glory on our arms. To fetch his ashes\r\nfrom a foreign land was in a manner to wave the flag of vanquished\r\nFrance aloft once more--that at least was what we hoped for--and this\r\nview of the case reconciled me to my mission. As soon as I was on my\r\nlegs again I started for Toulon, provided with full orders and\r\ninstructions, both royal and ministerial, and re-took command of the\r\nBelle-Poule, a command I was to hold in many seas, during three\r\nconsecutive years. I felt some regret at leaving Paris, but the delight\r\nat being back amongst the faithful and worthy fellows who made up my\r\ncrew, my second family, soon made me forget what I had left behind me.\r\nPresently a certain number of passengers came on board. They formed\r\nwhat was called the St Helena Mission. Almost all of them had been\r\ncomrades of Napoleon in his greatness and in his misfortunes. There\r\nwere Generals Bertrand and Gourgaud, M. de las Cazes, &c., &c. During\r\nthe long passages of the voyage, the conversation of these gentlemen,\r\nwho had been present at so many events and followed the Emperor through\r\nso many adventures, was most deeply interesting. Every day there was a\r\nrunning fire of anecdote and traits of character, much closer to the\r\ntruth doubtless than many a leisurely prepared history. I have often\r\nregretted we had no shorthand writer with us.\r\n\r\nDuring the first days of our voyage we touched at Cadiz to get our last\r\ndespatches before starting across the ocean. I was as glad as ever to\r\nsee the white walls of Cadiz again, and I made a pilgrimage to the\r\nCortadura, to the Trocadero (this in memory of the brilliant exploits\r\nof the Royal Guard in 1823), and also to the battle-field of Chiclana,\r\nwhich witnessed a terrible struggle between ourselves and the English\r\nin February 1811, some of the actors in which I had known. Coming back\r\nfrom Chiclana after a somewhat cheery luncheon, Arthur Bertrand, the\r\ngeneral's son, well known at that time in the gay world of Paris, gave\r\nus a specimen of the maddest equestrian prowess. He galloped at full\r\nspeed across the Alameda at Chiclana, which was paved with slippery\r\nflags, standing upright on his English saddle. There is a providence\r\nthat watches over madmen!\r\n\r\nA characteristic incident occurred on leaving Cadiz. In case of\r\ndelicate negotiations with the English authorities at St. Helena, and\r\nalso in order to draw up the protocol for the surrender of the body, a\r\nyoung diplomat, the Comte Philippe de Rohan Chabot,[Footnote: This\r\ngentleman died in London as French Ambassador, under the title of Comte\r\nde Jarna] had been associated with me.\r\n\r\nWe had hardly got out of the port of Cadiz, and cut our last\r\ncommunications with France, when I saw him approach me, looking very\r\nmuch embarrassed. He offered me a paper to read, saying it was only on\r\naccount of his orders he had not communicated it to me before. I cast\r\nmy eye over the signature at the foot of the paper and saw the name of\r\nM. Thiers, President of the Council. By these secret instructions,\r\nwhich were not to be imparted to me till we got to sea, M. Thiers\r\ninformed M. de Chabot that he, Chabot, was his direct agent and that he\r\ninvested him with superior authority to mine for as long as the mission\r\nshould last. Such was the strange missive, aimed not only at the\r\ncaptain in command of the ship, but also, with an evident intention to\r\nwound, at the King's son--an application in a very small way of that\r\nmaxim so dear to M. Thiers, \"the King reigns but he does not govern.\"\r\nStranger still was the care he took to keep it secret until, being cut\r\noff from France, I was no longer in a position to make any observation\r\non the contradiction between these fresh instructions and the precise\r\norders I had received previously. Friends from childhood as we were,\r\nPhilippe and I, no idea of conflict between us was admissible. I made\r\nno complaint to any one and treated M. Thiers' behaviour to me with\r\ncontempt, but from that day the sympathetic and almost affectionate\r\nrelations I had previously lived in with that statesman came to an\r\nend--they were replaced by a sense of deep distrust and a scanty esteem\r\nfor his character.\r\n\r\nThe Belle-Poule put in at Teneriffe to take in provisions and water,\r\nand I took advantage of this stoppage to finish the ascent of the\r\nfamous Peak which I had had to break off in 1837. The last cone, all of\r\ncrumbly pumice stone, and at a very acute angle, is tolerably tiring.\r\nOn the summit is a small plateau, the soft soil of which is covered\r\nwith flowers of sulphur and creviced with smoke holes from which\r\nscalding steam keeps escaping. Having got up in two days, we descended\r\nrapidly to the smiling little town of Orotava, built amidst the most\r\nlovely vegetation in a sort of ravine opening out on the sea. The\r\nfemale population of Orotava has a well-deserved reputation for beauty,\r\nand we were very kindly met by an invitation to make sure of the fact\r\nby being present at an afternoon dance, a sort of \"garden party\" got up\r\nin our honour--a great temptation truly, but a great perplexity as\r\nwell! People coming back off a mountain climb, including two waterless\r\nbivouacs and a pull through the smoke and ashes of a volcano, are not\r\nin ball trim, either as to costume or to cleanliness. After a hasty\r\ncouncil of war, it was decided that we should draw lots for the names\r\nof three of our party, who were to wash themselves, and to whom each of\r\nthe non-chosen should furnish the least damaged articles of his own\r\nclothing, so as to put them in proper condition to go to the ball and\r\nkeep up the honour of our flag before the belles of Orotava. We retired\r\ninto a wood to proceed to draw lots and embellish the elect Fate did\r\nnot favour me. I did not go to the ball, but my boots did, and our\r\ncomrades came back full of admiration of all they had seen.\r\n\r\nFrom Teneriffe our passage was a slow one. We had calms, storms, even\r\ngales, and then a fresh delay in port at Bahia in Brazil. I had been\r\nadvised on leaving Paris to arrange the progress of the mission so as\r\nto make the return of the ashes of the Emperor to Europe coincide with\r\nthe opening of the Chambers in the end of December. Indeed I believe\r\nthe chief importance of the return of the ashes of Napoleon, in M.\r\nThiers' mind, lay in this coincidence. It was the tom-tom by beating\r\nwhich he hoped to drown all those reports and inklings of ministerial\r\nchanges which always sprout at such moments in the parliamentary soil.\r\nBut it was somewhat difficult to time our arrival to a given moment,\r\nwith a sailing ship, and after such a long voyage. Originally I was to\r\nhave called at the Cape before going to St. Helena. I thought it better\r\nto replace our stoppage at the Cape by one at Bahia, so as to shorten\r\nthe journey and save time. Very uninteresting our stay at Bahia was,\r\nsave for the following picturesque incident.\r\n\r\nI had chartered a small steamer on which I used to go on sporting\r\nexpeditions with some of the officers. They were somewhat in the nature\r\nof voyages of discovery up the rivers which fall into Bahia Bay. During\r\none of these excursions we had got some considerable distance up the\r\nCachoeira without seeing a sign of any inhabitants, and leaving our\r\nboat at anchor, we had landed and spent our day in slaying toucans,\r\nparrokeets of all colours, and all the strange birds and beasts\r\npeopling the virgin forest, when at sunset we fell upon a cleared path,\r\nwhich led us to a wide glade and then to a village, the existence of\r\nwhich had been hitherto quite unsuspected by us. We entered it and\r\nfound it deserted, the doors of all the houses shut. We went towards a\r\nvery large square in the middle of the \"Pueblo\"--it was deserted too.\r\nWe entered a fine church, the door of which stood open--not a soul\r\nwithin it, though the smell of the incense at some recently performed\r\nreligious ceremony still hung in the air. In the middle of the square\r\nstood a kiosk, evidently intended for concerts; the instruments of an\r\norchestra were still there, lying on the chairs before the desks, as if\r\nthe music had only been broken off a few minutes previously. This\r\nsuddenly deserted village rather puzzled us. But in the hope of\r\nbringing the population back to life, and with a certain spice too of\r\nmischief, we laid down our guns, and seizing on the big drum, and the\r\nabandoned trombones and clarionets, we raised a most alarming noise. It\r\nwas mere waste of time, nobody came. The evening was falling, it was\r\ntime to get back on board our steamer, and we quietly retook our way\r\ntowards her. Night--a moonlight night it was--had completely closed in,\r\nwhen we got to the mangrove creek, where we had left the small boat\r\nwhich was to bring us back on board. We were crowding into the little\r\ncraft, half aground on the mud, when a great clamour rose from the\r\nforest, and we saw weapons glint through the foliage on all sides. In\r\nthe twinkling of an eye, before we had time to get over our surprise, a\r\ncrowd of people armed with guns, swords, and pikes, rushed up at top\r\nspeed, yelling loudly, and surrounded us, some remaining on shore and\r\nothers throwing themselves into the water. We were instantly carried\r\noff, disarmed, separated, soundly thrashed, and dragged into the\r\nforest. Anybody who has looked at the picture of the savages attacking\r\nCaptain Cook, in the history of his voyage, will have an exact idea of\r\nthe scene. It was not otherwise than picturesque in the moonlight, and\r\nunder that tropical vegetation; and it really was an attack by savages\r\ntoo, most of them negroes, and the rest mulattoes. Very luckily for us,\r\nour surprise and our unloaded guns, and the way we were crowded into\r\nthe boat, prevented our making any resistance, otherwise we should\r\ncertainly have been massacred, surrounded as we were by 200 armed men.\r\nEach of us had his own little experience in the scuffle. I, for my\r\npart, jumped into the water, knocking up the pikes of two negroes, who\r\nlooked as if they were going to spit me, with my gun, and hurriedly\r\ncaught a man--with a civilian's hat on his head, a sash over his\r\nshoulder, and a big sword in his hand, who seemed to me to be the\r\nleader of the band--round the waist. I gave him to understand, in a few\r\nwords, in bad Portuguese, that I commmanded the French warships\r\nanchored at Bahia, and that if harm came to any of us, he and his\r\nfellows would live to repent it. But before I could finish my speech\r\nthe angry crowd fell on me, carried me off, and dragged me to a mound,\r\nagainst which, as I seemed to understand, they meant to back me and\r\nshoot me. Indeed five or six negroes stationed in front of me hastily\r\nloaded their guns. The situation was far from pleasant, for those who\r\nknow the negro race know what they are capable of when swayed by the\r\nparoxysms of excitement into which they work themselves, whether from\r\ndrunkenness, or rage, or fear. Fouchard, whom two or three men were\r\nholding a few steps off from me, seeing what was happening, threw off\r\nhis captors by a superhuman effort and sprang to my side. We clung fast\r\nto each other, and this caused a fresh struggle and a respite of a\r\nminute's duration, during which the man in the sash, who had quickly\r\nunderstood this was becoming a bad business for himself, charged at the\r\nhead of the most reasonable of his mulattoes. We were captured and\r\nrecaptured several times, but victory at last rested with the man in\r\nthe scarf, and an explanation became possible. It appears there had\r\nbeen an election, with considerable disturbances--blessed be elections\r\nin all places and countries!--in the village, on the preceding day. The\r\ninhabitants, in their over-excitement, had been struck first with\r\nsurprise, and afterwards with terror on hearing us firing at the\r\nparrokeets. Their terror reached its height when seven or eight\r\nwhite-skinned men, oddly armed and accoutred, were seen to enter the\r\nvillage. The whole population fled into the woods. Then noting from\r\nafar how small our number was, and more especially observing our\r\nretreat, valour took the place of fright, and arming itself, it rushed\r\nto the enemy's pursuit! We were set at liberty of course, and apologies\r\nwere duly made; but that did not mend the blows received, especially by\r\none of the lieutenants of the Belle-Poule, Penhoat, who had been half\r\nmurdered. We boarded our steamer, and found the English engineer in\r\ncharge of her completely drunk. When we told him our story he rushed\r\nbelow to his engine-room, and fetched out a huge pistol that must have\r\ndated from Cromwell's time; and we had all the trouble in the world to\r\nprevent him from going on shore alone to take signal vengeance on\r\n\"those damned niggers.\"\r\n\r\nLeaving Bahia, we had to go a long way down the Southern Atlantic\r\nbefore we got a favourable wind. We reached St. Helena at last--a great\r\nblack rock, a jagged volcanic island resembling Martinique, minus its\r\nsplendid vegetation--a scrap of Scotland set in mid-ocean, and swept\r\nincessantly by the Trade wind, which blows with wearisome continuance\r\nand gathers a thick and permanent cloud-clap above the isle. It looked\r\ngloomy from the sea, and the impression on arrival there was gloomy\r\ntoo. James Town, the capital, is simply a wretched village, stretching\r\nalong a narrow valley, shut in by dreary-looking rocks crowned by\r\nforts, to which you climb by staircases counting six hundred steps. The\r\ncountry around Plantation House, the Governor's residence, the valley\r\nof the Tomb, the Tomb itself with the legendary willows, and Longwood,\r\nthe prison house, all are equally gloomy, and equally calculated to\r\nkill the great genius banished thither, by inches.\r\n\r\nThe business which had brought me was quickly settled between myself\r\nand the Governor, General Middlemore. The orders of the British\r\nGovernment were clear and precise, and the local authorities showed\r\ngreat goodwill in carrying them out. They undertook the exclusive care\r\nof the exhumation and transport of the remains over British territory,\r\nand it was all done with the utmost propriety. The only request I made\r\nand obtained was, that the coffin should be opened before it was handed\r\nover to us, so as to be sure that we were taking neither a hotbed of\r\ninfection nor an imaginary corpse on board. The Governor himself being\r\nill I saw but little of him. He commissioned the officer in command of\r\nthe troops, Colonel Trelawny, of the Royal Artillery, to represent him.\r\nHe was a pleasant man, but decidedly eccentric. His great mania was the\r\nstudy of genealogy, and he never failed to explain when we met that he\r\nwas my cousin, and that we were both related to the late Sultan Mahmoud\r\non the female side!\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready the exhumation took place, and very imposing it was.\r\nEverybody felt impressed when the coffin was seen coming slowly down\r\nthe mountain side, to the firing of cannon, escorted by British\r\ninfantry with arms reversed, the band playing, to the dull rolling\r\naccompaniment of the drums, that splendid funeral march which English\r\npeople call The Dead March in Saul, but which is really no other than\r\nthe ancient Catholic chant of Adeste Fideles. General Middlemore,\r\ndropping with fatigue, formally handed over the body to me; and the\r\ncoffin was lowered into the long-boat of the Belle-Poule, which then\r\nstarted for the ship. The scene at that moment was very fine. It was a\r\nstriking moment A magnificent sunset had been succeeded by a twilight\r\nof the deepest calm. The British authorities and the troops stood\r\nmotionless on the beach, while our ship's guns fired a royal salute. I\r\nstood in the stern of my long-boat, over which floated a magnificent\r\nTricolour flag worked by the ladies of St Helena. Beside me were the\r\ngenerals and superior officers, M. de Chabot and M de las Gazes. The\r\npick of my topmen, all in white, with crape on their arms, and\r\nbareheaded like ourselves, rowed the boat in silence, and with the most\r\nadmirable precision We advanced with majestic slowness, escorted by the\r\nboats bearing the staff. It was very touching, and a deep national\r\nsentiment seemed to hover over the whole scene.\r\n\r\nTwo days later we set sail for France, which was reached after a\r\npassage of forty-one days. During the passage, feeling anxious at\r\nhaving had no news from Europe for four months, I spoke several ships,\r\nand amongst others, south of the line, I spoke a Dutch man-o'-war on\r\nher way to Java, which gave us details of the coalition apparently\r\ndirected against Mehemet Ali, the Egyptian Viceroy, but aimed, in\r\nreality, at France. Not knowing what might result from the performances\r\nof the allied naval forces on the Syrian coast, we on board the frigate\r\nand her consort, the Favorite, determined to take all usual precautions\r\nin case of war; and each of us made ready, after his own fashion, for\r\nhis eventual departure to another world. There was, in most cases, a\r\ngreat destroying of souvenirs, papers, and compromising correspondence.\r\nGeneral Gourgaud attracted our attention by the trembling care with\r\nwhich he re-read a perfect mountain of notes in a feminine hand, which\r\nhe burnt one by one in a basin, gathering up the ashes and preserving\r\nthem in a bottle--not a bad way of keeping tender memories quite safe\r\nfrom any inquisitiveness But all these warlike preparations were thrown\r\naway. When the Belle Poule cast anchor at Cherbourg on November 30th,\r\nthe storm had passed by. My mission closed at Cherbourg, but I found\r\norders there to tranship the coffin on to a steamboat, and then take it\r\nround to Paris by the Seine, my crew and that of the corvette Favorite\r\nto form the escort. I will not tell the story of this conveying of the\r\nbody. At St Helena things had on the whole been done by the British\r\narmy on the one part and our naval forces on the other, with all the\r\nchivalrous seriousness and dignity which always attend international\r\nrelations when confided to those who wear the sword. In France the\r\nconveyance of the remains of Napoleon took on quite another character.\r\nIt was first and foremost a show, in which, as always happens in our\r\ncountry, many people desired to play a part which was inappropriate and\r\nsometimes ridiculous. I had often to interfere to get things put to\r\nrights again. At La Bouille, for instance, which we reached at\r\nnightfall, to meet the river flotilla to which we were to be\r\ntransferred, I was shown, as the vessel which was to receive the coffin\r\nand the staff of the escort, a frightful-looking boat on which a sort\r\nof hideous dais had been built, with all the frippery and plumes of the\r\nPompes Funebres, an official catafalque worthy of Carpentras or of\r\nBrives-la-Gaillarde. I immediately gave orders for this masterpiece of\r\nbad taste to be destroyed, a coat of black paint given to the boat, and\r\neverything cleared forward, so as to place the coffin there well in\r\nsight, and covered with a violet velvet pall. My men at once fell to\r\nwork at this transformation, when a gentleman in evening dress\r\nadvanced, and in a tone of great authority, forbade my sailors to touch\r\nanything. \"I got my orders from M. Cave (the Director of the Beaux\r\nArts) and from the Minister. All the decoration was designed by me, and\r\ncarried out under my direction, I hold to it, and I forbid anybody to\r\ntouch it,\" he said. \"But, my good sir,\" I replied, \"my orders have been\r\ngiven, and will be carried out.\" My gentleman became so violent that I\r\ndesired him to leave the vessel instantly. \"But surely you are not\r\ngoing to put me ashore at this hour (it was almost dark) in the open\r\nfields? I don't know where I am; I don't see any houses.\" \"That's\r\nnothing to me, you have been insolent, so it is your own fault. Put\r\nthis gentleman ashore.\" Four sailors advanced, but he gave in, and\r\nnobody ever heard of him again. By the following morning the\r\ntransformation was complete, and the coffin moving unsheltered up the\r\ncourse of the river, as though to take possession of the stream, was\r\nmuch more striking than all the tinsel and canopies imaginable. The\r\nwhole voyage up to Courbevoie, the point of arrival, was a mere classic\r\nreproduction of the usual official journey--flags, authorities girt\r\nwith tricolour sashes, clergy pronouncing blessings, shaking with\r\nterror all the time, horses, gendarmes, curious crowds of holiday\r\nmakers, the only thing lacking being the speeches. From Courbevoie the\r\nbody was taken in procession through the Champs Elysees to the\r\nInvalides, with the usual ceremonial, which I had already witnessed in\r\nthe cases of Charles X. and the Duchesse d'Orleans, but with one extra\r\npoint, the cold, and it was terrible.\r\n\r\nAt the Invalides four-and-twenty non-commissioned officers advanced to\r\ncarry the coffin into the church; but in spite of the most desperate\r\nefforts the veterans could not succeed in lifting it, and I had to make\r\nmy sailors carry it. The King received the body at the entrance to the\r\nnave, and there rather a comical scene took place. It appears that a\r\nlittle speech, which I was to have delivered when I met my father, and\r\nalso the answer he was to give me, had been drawn up in Council, only\r\nthe authorities had omitted to inform me concerning it. So when I\r\narrived I simply saluted with my sword, and then stood aside. I saw\r\nindeed that this silent salute, followed by retreat, had thrown\r\nsomething out; but my father, after a moment's hesitation, improvised\r\nsome appropriate sentence, and the matter was afterwards arranged in\r\nthe Moniteur. The Church of the Invalides was full to overflowing, the\r\nChamber of Peers and the Chamber of Deputies being seated in the choir.\r\nThe success of the day fell to my brave sailors. Everybody was curious\r\nto see them. Their athletic forms, easy gait, and kindly sunburnt faces\r\nat once won over the general public, especially the feminine portion of\r\nit; and then they were something new to that sight-loving Parisian\r\npopulation, to whom so many have been given since then, that for want\r\nof a better the only thing offered them at the present moment is Dinah\r\nSalifou and the danse du ventre. What a fall here too, compared vith\r\nthe past! During the triumphal passage of the Emperor's ashes down the\r\nChamps Elysees between two ranks of soldiers and National Guards, who\r\nkept back an immense multitude, I had constantly amid the various\r\nshouts caught one of \"Down with traitors,\" which, at first, I did not\r\nunderstand. I had been so far away. But it was explained to me that\r\nthis demonstration was aimed at my father and his ministers, guilty as\r\nthey were of having refused to launch France into a general war about\r\nthe Eastern question. I fancy my father troubled his head little about\r\nthese would-be-wise demonstrators, worthy forerunners of the Boulevard\r\nbraggarts who, at a later date, in 1870, so appositely shouted \"a\r\nBerlin.\" He had other matters to preoccupy him. The ease with which all\r\nthe Governments in Europe had leagued themselves together, to inflict a\r\nmoral check on France, under cover of the Pasha of Egypt, betrayed the\r\nlatent hostility of all those powers to our own country. Let us say it\r\noutright. In the eyes of the European monarchies, the Government of\r\nJuly, by virtue of its origin, and however wise and courageous the\r\npolicy of the King, my father, might have been, had always remained a\r\nrevolutionary, and therefore a hostile government Nothing else was\r\npossible; and so at bottom it always will be, as long as we continue to\r\nrun in the rut along which we have been floundering for the last\r\nhundred years. Look at any country in Europe, no matter which, and see\r\nagainst whom the established Government carries on the domestic\r\nstruggle. Against Nihilists in Russia, Socialists in Germany,\r\nanarchists and unquiet spirits of all kind everywhere, imitations of\r\nthose of our own country, and by them encouraged to press on the same\r\ncourse of demand, and spoliation, and licence. And hence the necessary\r\nconsequence, that sovereigns and organized societies, whose first\r\ndesire is to exist, and neither to be overthrown nor despoiled, are\r\nalways ready to make common cause against that hotbed of bad example,\r\nRevolutionary France. The events of 1840 showed this with the utmost\r\nclearness; and in face of that demonstration the path of duty lay\r\nclear. It was to lose no time in taking, without boastfulness, but also\r\nwithout weakness, all the necessary measures against the danger which\r\nwas constantly threatening, although for the moment it was warded off.\r\nAmong these measures was one my father passionately desired, and which\r\nhe snatched from the Chambers by sheer tenacity--the fortification of\r\nParis. This tenacity was necessary, for the struggle was long, bitter,\r\nand inexplicable While it lasted the heroes of the cafes greeted my\r\nfather in the streets and at reviews with insulting shouts. The cry,\r\n\"Down with the Bastille,\" had succeeded that of \"Down with traitors,\"\r\nand all the fainthearted section would have knuckled down. All the\r\nenergy of the King, of my brother the Due d'Orleans--as eager as\r\nhimself on the question--and of the ministers, was needed to bring them\r\nback into fighting line. The aid too of those patriots of all\r\nshades--and thank God there still are some such!--who put national\r\nindependence and honour above party questions, had to be invoked. And\r\nso Paris was fortified Who dares nowadays to say, that this was not a\r\nconvincing proof of the King's foresight as a ruler? Who dares to say,\r\nthat if hesitation, and desultoriness, and incapacity, and evil chance,\r\nhad not clung to the command of our armies in 1870, the German invasion\r\nmight not have been broken up upon those ramparts?\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1841 was also spent in raising our battalions of\r\nChasseurs-a-pied, the personal work of my eldest brother. I used often\r\nto go and keep him company in the camp at St. Omer, while he was\r\nemploying all his great powers in organizing this force. When it was\r\ndone he gave a splendid fite, to which he invited the officers of the\r\nEnglish garrisons on the opposite coast, deputing me to receive them. A\r\nfew days later the population of Paris was surprised and delighted by\r\nthe sight of these ten splendid battalions, in their simple but elegant\r\nuniform, pressing through the streets with swinging step, filling the\r\ncourtyard of the Tuileries, and forming up in the space of a few\r\nminutes to be inspected by the King. These fine troops, with their\r\nstrong esprit de corps, have since then earned glory by many exploits\r\nin all quarters of the globe. The number of battalions has been raised\r\nfrom ten to thirty. The organization, given them at the outset by a\r\nvigorous hand, has remained intact. Their uniform even is unchanged,\r\nhaving escaped the prevalent mania for bringing everything down to the\r\nsame level of ugliness. The only thing gone is the original name,\r\nChasseurs d'Orleans; but what matters the name when the service remains!\r\n\r\nMy memories of the winter of 1841 are full of recollections concerning\r\nour national defence. Mingled with them, however, are some others of a\r\nless austere nature Masked balls were the rage that year. They were\r\ngiven in all directions. I was only three-and-twenty, and thought them\r\nall delightful Just at that moment Chicard--the famous Chicard--shared\r\nthe sceptre of the opera-balls with Musard, the chief of the orchestra.\r\nA quiet-living worthy tradesman on weekdays, on important occasions an\r\nofficer in the National Guard, Monsieur L \"le grand Chicard,\" dressed\r\nin the most eccentric of costumes, led indescribable farandoles to the\r\nsound of broken chairs and pistol shots, accompanied by Musard's\r\norchestra, at these entertainments. There were balls in the Opera\r\nHouse, at the Renaissance, the Salle Ventadour, the Varietes--these\r\nlast the prettiest and the most fashionable and amusing. Not an evening\r\ncoat in the whole ball-room, everybody, men and women alike, in\r\ncostume, and everybody acquainted with everybody else. And what gaiety\r\nand go there was about it all' You asked your partner in the\r\nupper-boxes to dance with you, from the floor of the house, and she, to\r\nlose no time, came down outside the balustrades, faithfully passed down\r\nby friendly hands. When the quadrille was over you met jolly comrades\r\neverywhere, with their partners astride on their shoulders, shaking\r\nhands as it were two stories at a time. But there is an end to all\r\nthings. My two brothers--Nemours and Aumale--went off to fight in\r\nAfrica under General Bugeaud; and, in the month of May, I myself was\r\nsent out to the Newfoundland station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n1841-1842\r\n\r\n\r\nI left Cherbourg for Newfoundland on May 19th, 1841. It had been\r\narranged that I was to go by the North Sea, to put into the Texel, and\r\nto go to the Hague to pay my respects in person to the King of the\r\nNetherlands. Almost as soon as I had disembarked at the Helder, I went\r\non board the royal yacht, which was to take me to Alkmaar by the Noord\r\nHolland Canal. This yacht, commanded by a very pleasant fellow, a naval\r\nlieutenant, M. Dedel, was really charming. She had been built in the\r\nseventeenth century, and had been used by Admirals Van Ruyter and Van\r\nTromp when they went to take up their commands. She was covered all\r\nover with gilt carvings, the deckhouse in the stern especially, and\r\nlooked as if she had started freshly painted out of one of Backhuysen's\r\npictures. Once on board her, a legion of horses towed her along, full\r\ntrot, and I went to bed. When I awoke, I found the yacht moored beside\r\nthe quay at Alkmaar, the city of cheeses, whence a carriage took me to\r\nHaarlem and Amsterdam, along the Haarlem Zee, which has been drained\r\ndry since then, and transformed into splendid meadow land, as the\r\nZuider Zee will some day be. At Amsterdam I rushed to the museum, where\r\nI was received by M. Apostol, the director, who had known the\r\nScheffers' father intimately at Rotterdam. Oh that museum! Oh those\r\nprints! But M. de Bois-le-Comte, the French Minister, was pitiless. He\r\ntore me away from all those masterpieces, and forced me to follow the\r\nmillround of the programme he had laid out for me. He dragged me off to\r\nZaandam (Saardam in French). This pretty Japanese-looking village, in\r\nthe midst of a wide polder, surrounded by over five hundred windmills,\r\nlooking like a row of gigantic sharpshooters, is a resort of pilgrims,\r\nand the holy spot is the hut of Peter the Great. The wretched wooden\r\nhouse, shut up in a sort of casemate, was the property of the Queen,\r\nsister of the Emperor Nicholas, and the shanty was never mentioned by\r\nher or to her but in the most feeling manner. Flectamus genua!\r\nLeva...ate! Amongst other inscriptions there, I found the names of two\r\nFrench actors, Dormeuil and Monval, which recall anything but pious\r\nmemories to my mind.\r\n\r\nFrom Zaandam I went to the palace, to Van Ruyter's tomb, to the\r\npelicans in the Zoological Gardens, and then I escaped from the furious\r\nBois-le-Comte, who would have liked me never to go about except in a\r\nglass case labelled \"Ecce the Prince de Joinville.\" Very kind and very\r\nwitty he was, all the same, one of those finished diplomatists of the\r\nold school--a disciple of M. de Talleyrand. He had been everywhere,\r\nseen everything, observed everything, and he kept me under the charm of\r\nhis conversation all through my hasty trip in Holland. During the last\r\npreceding years he had represented France in Portugal and Spain\r\nsuccessively, and had been with the two Queens--my future\r\nsister-in-law--Dona Maria in Portugal, and the Regent Christina in\r\nSpain, through all the most violent disturbances, struggles, and\r\ndangers of the military conspiracies in those countries. He never tired\r\nof talking about the courage of these two ladies, the nature of which\r\nwas very different in each case. The courage of the Queen of Portugal,\r\nhe said, was resolute, but mournful and gloomy. The example she set was\r\ngood, but she cast a chill on officers and men alike. Queen\r\nChristina--passionate, a woman to her finger tips, careless of danger,\r\nbut shedding tears of nervous excitement when the bullets smashed her\r\nwindows and flew hither and thither about the apartments--magnetised\r\nher defenders. In the one case you cried \"Welcome, Death!\" in the other\r\nyou shouted \"Forward!\" Very interesting indeed was the description\r\nBois-le-Comte gave me of the La Granja conspiracy. How, having been\r\nwarned in the middle of the night of the danger threatening Queen\r\nChristina and her daughters, he got up in haste to hurry to their\r\nassistance, but desired, first of all, to warn the British Minister and\r\ncarry him along with him. How, when he reached the house of the\r\nminister, Mr. Villiers, afterwards Lord Clarendon, he rushed without\r\nmeeting a soul into his bedroom, where the bed-curtains shook\r\nconvulsively at the noise of his entrance, and the head alone of the\r\nminister appeared, saying, \"I'll follow you,\" while a soft voice tried\r\nto detain him, with all the tenderest appeals in the Spanish language.\r\n\"I took myself off double quick,\" said Bois-le-Comte to me; \"but I had\r\nrecognised the voice.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Amsterdam we went to the Hague, and as soon as I got there I asked\r\nto see the King. \"Let him come at once\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nKing William, young-looking still, with a graceful figure and a kindly\r\nengaging face, framed with a fringe of grizzling beard, had a loud\r\nvoice and a hearty laugh. He was witty in conversation. The Queen, whom\r\nI never saw laugh, nor even smile, talked cleverly too, but she picked\r\nher words too obviously. Her daughter, the young Princess Sophia, now\r\nGrand-Duchess of Saxe-Weimar, was clever too. I was watching her dance\r\nat a ball one night, wearing a pretty gown, the chief adornment of\r\nwhich was an eastern scarf, when her father, to whom I was talking,\r\nsaid, \"Marmotte (her pet name in the family) looks like a Bayadere\r\nto-day.\" And indeed she had all the grace and charm of one.\r\n\r\nMy stay at the Hague was one succession of gatherings, dinners, balls,\r\nat which the cordiality of my reception never failed for one minute. It\r\ntouched me much, and I have kept a grateful memory of it, for there was\r\nsome merit, on the King's part, in its being so. Had we not largely\r\ncontributed by our support of the Belgian revolution to lessening his\r\nkingdom by one half? And there had been yet another wound to his\r\nvanity. In his youth King William, then Prince of Orange, full of eager\r\nbravery, had gone to serve in Spain under the Duke of Wellington. He\r\nhad been wounded in the ranks of the British army at Waterloo, and on\r\nthe strength of these antecedents he had offered himself in 1815 as a\r\ncandidate for the hand of Princess Charlotte, heir-presumptive to the\r\nCrown of England. He had been ousted. And by whom? By Prince Leopold of\r\nSaxe-Coburg, whom we had just made King of the Belgians. In spite of\r\nthese causes for coldness, at all events, the welcome I was given by\r\nthe King, his family, and by every class of that honest and\r\nwell-behaved Dutch race, was marked by a constantly increasing\r\nkindliness, which filled Bois-le-Comte and his very witty secretary, La\r\nRosiere, with delight. Just at the moment of parting, the King made me\r\na present of an admirable copy in reduced size of Rembrandt's Anatomy\r\nLesson, which hung in his study, saying, \"You are going to\r\nNewfoundland; you shall bring me back a dog in exchange,\" which\r\ncommission I faithfully executed.\r\n\r\nTo finish up my visit to Holland, I paid a visit to the Naval Arsenal\r\nat Flushing, and as I passed through Zeeland I saw from afar, and not\r\nwithout emotion, the belfry towers of Bergen-op-Zoom, a town which\r\nwitnessed the performance of two of the most brilliant exploits in our\r\nannals. The first--the taking of the stronghold by assault, by Marshal\r\nde Lowendal's army, in 1747. The second--the assault delivered on it on\r\nthe 8th and 9th of March, 1814, by the whole English army, and\r\ntriumphantly repulsed by a handful of soldiers and sailors commanded by\r\nGeneral Bizannet. The assault under Marshal de Lowendal has been\r\ncommemorated first of all in a celebrated song, and later by an\r\nadmirable drawing in body colour by Van Blarenberg, which is to be seen\r\nin the Versailles Museum. But the exploit of 1814 has been almost lost\r\nsight of amid our disasters and the subsequent invasion. Very few\r\npeople are aware that the British army made a forcible attack on\r\nBergen-op-Zoom, getting into the town by the port at low tide, and\r\nscaling the ramparts, led and backed up by the inhabitants, who had\r\nrisen in favour of the House of Orange, and that the enemy's columns\r\ngot as far as the middle of the town, whence, after twelve hours'\r\nfighting, they were driven over the ramparts by the resolute bravery of\r\nthe defending force, leaving more prisoners in its hands than its own\r\nfighting men numbered. The details of this splendid page of military\r\nhistory should be read as told by Colonel Legrand of the Engineers, who\r\ncommanded under General Bizannet. In them, among other dramatic\r\nincidents, will be found an episode about a bellringer, which is almost\r\nidentical with the one Sardou has incorporated in his fine play Patrie.\r\n\r\nFrom the Texel, or, to be more exact, from Neu-Diep to Newfoundland, by\r\nthe north coast of Scotland, the passage, though we made it without\r\ndisaster, was terribly trying to both our crews and our ships, which\r\nlast were much damaged, and lost nearly all their sails. An incessant\r\nseries of gales kept us under green seas nearly all the time. Upon\r\nthese followed thick fogs, and finally we fell among numberless\r\nicebergs. So it was with a lively sense of relief that I found myself\r\nanchored at last within the haven of Le Croc, the headquarters of our\r\nsquadron during the fishing season. The haven was itself so obstructed\r\nwith ice that on the very night of my arrival, with the help of my cook\r\nand some tins of jam, I was able to serve up Neapolitan ices to my\r\nstaff, like Tortoni himself.\r\n\r\nThere was very near being a serious breach of discipline on board the\r\nfrigate during our passage. A sailor refused to obey, and threatened\r\none of the midshipmen--a serious act of insubordination, which,\r\naccording to the laws then in force, entailed corporal punishment on\r\nits perpetrator. I immediately called a court-martial, which, having\r\nheard witnesses and defendant, according to regulations, sentenced the\r\nman to a certain number of strokes with the rope's end. The hour for\r\ncarrying out the sentence came, the crew was mustered, the officers in\r\ntheir places and under arms. I was in my cabin, just buckling on my\r\nsword, when my second in command came in like a whirlwind. \"They are\r\ngoing to ask for mercy,\" he cried; \"it's your own fault. The men know\r\nyour hatred of corporal punishment. They are going to presume on it. I\r\nbeg you'll give me leave to run the first man that opens his mouth\r\nthrough with my sword.\" Up till that time I had avoided the use of\r\ncorporal punishment, a matter which had been made all the easier for me\r\nby the good feeling and quiet behaviour of the crew I had had under my\r\ncommand. But this time the scandal had been notorious, the punishment\r\nmust be exemplary, and the law applied without mercy. What would become\r\nof the authority of an isolated handful of officers, on the high seas,\r\namong hundreds of seamen, if they had no possible recourse to force, to\r\npunishment drill, or to long terms of imprisonment? What, again, would\r\nbecome of that purely moral influence, which is indispensable on board\r\na ship which is practically always at sea, if the maintenance of\r\ndiscipline was ever liable to the slightest failure? Filled as I was\r\nwith even more than the ordinary sense of the imperious claims of duty\r\non the officer in command, I reassured my subordinate. \"Make your mind\r\neasy,\" I told him. \"I would be brayed in a mortar sooner than tolerate\r\none moment's hesitation in carrying out the sentence. I shall stand at\r\nthe head of the crew, and have the punishment carried out in front of\r\nme. The men will read my countenance and nobody will stir, I'll answer\r\nfor it!\" And so it was. I took my place, all eyes turned on me, and\r\neverything passed off according to rule--To say the scene was not a\r\npainful one to me would be to tell a lie. But duty has to come first.\r\n\r\nAs my second in command had said, I had a horror of corporal punishment\r\nas laid down by the Convention, a relic of another age, when navy crews\r\nwere recruited amongst a set of vagabonds picked up in all quarters. I\r\nthought it degrading. Often, among my brother officers, I had blamed\r\nthe unmeasured use I had seen made of it on board ships I did not\r\ncommand. And glad indeed I was when it was done away with. A commanding\r\nofficer invested, and justly so, with unlimited authority on board his\r\nown ship, is sure by intelligence, firmness, and sense of duty, to find\r\nother means than the lash of making the saving law of absolute\r\nobedience to superiors respected, without going such lengths as the\r\ncaptain of an American warship, who, on his own responsibility, hanged\r\none of his midshipmen, nearly related to the Minister for Naval\r\nAffairs, who had been guilty of attempted mutiny, from the yardarm.\r\n\r\nI will not enlarge here on what has become the Newfoundland Question,\r\nwhich I have naturally had to study in all its aspects. Suffice it to\r\nrecall the fact that when the Island of Newfoundland became British\r\nterritory, the conquerors ceded the exclusive right of fishing on half\r\nthe coast to France, with the reservation that we were only to remain\r\ntemporarily, during the fishing season, and have no permanent\r\nestablishments on the island. When these fishing rights were conceded\r\nto us (and they soon became very important, employing as they did over\r\ntwenty thousand sailors, and turning the Newfoundland fisheries into\r\none of the chief training grounds for our service sailors) the island\r\nwas well-nigh uninhabited. There are no opportunities for conflict in a\r\ndesert country. But little by little the island grew populous. On the\r\npart where we had the fishing rights, the \"French Shore,\" a very\r\nlimited, almost insignificant, English population gathered, and, oddly\r\nenough, we ourselves brought it there, desirous as we were to leave\r\ncaretakers to look after and keep in order, from one season to the\r\nother, the indispensable establishments for the curing, drying, and\r\nsalting of the codfish, which we ourselves could not occupy\r\npermanently. Everywhere, during my cruise, I found this English\r\npopulation, living by us, and on excellent terms with our\r\nNewfoundlanders. To such a pitch was the excellence of these terms\r\noccasionally carried, that paying a visit one day to a worthy\r\nsea-captain from St. Malo, who had laid up his ship during the fishing\r\nseason, and settled on shore, in an English house, I saw two chubby\r\nchildren burst in, shouting \"Papa, papa!\" while a young and pretty\r\nEnglishwoman, sitting by, never lifted her eyes from her work. \"The\r\nlittle geese,\" said the worthy Breton, \"see me so often, they've got\r\ninto the habit of calling me papa!\"\r\n\r\nThis entente cordiale would no doubt have continued indefinitely, and\r\nnobody would have heard any mention of a Newfoundland Question,\r\nendangering the international relations between the two countries, if\r\nthe southern portion of the island, entirely English as it was, and\r\nwith a temperate climate, had not increased so rapidly in population as\r\nto have a constitution, liberal institutions, a Parliament, and the\r\nconsequent elections. The electioneering agents forthwith found they\r\nneeded a sensational popular platform, and this platform has ended by\r\nbecoming something like the \"Irredenta\" movement in Italy, a claim for\r\nnational rights over the national soil. \"Newfoundland for the\r\nNewfoundlanders.\" There lies the whole of the Newfoundland Question.\r\nLocally, nobody bothers their head about it, but in the press, and on\r\nthe phantom-haunted ground of electoral politics, it has kindled many\r\npassions, and may very likely engender ruin and bloodshed some of these\r\ndays. These facts taken for granted, I return to my personal\r\nrecollections. Unlike most of my brother officers, I found my stay in\r\nNewfoundland (in the summer months, during which we were stationed\r\nthere, be it understood) very pleasant. The island is a hilly one,\r\ncovered with pine forests. Where the woods fail, there are lakes and\r\nrivers, admirably clear, and swarming with salmon and trout. There was\r\nplenty of game, and all this in the midst of the uninhabited region\r\nwhere every one can enjoy the completest liberty, with no limits but\r\nthose imposed by his own tastes and endurance. If there were no\r\ndrawback to all these advantages, Newfoundland in the summer-time would\r\nbe a paradise, and there is no such thing as that upon our globe. The\r\ndrawback is the flies, little black ones, called the \"black fly,\" the\r\npest of all northern countries, against which one is quite defenceless.\r\nThey get in everywhere; no preservative stops them; no ointment nor any\r\ndaubing repels them. During a hunting excursion I made to the Isle of\r\nGroix, so christened by some native of L'Orient, which is about eight\r\nmiles off Le Croc, I saw some of my comrades with their heads swelled\r\nup like a hydrocephalous patient's, so that their eyes had disappeared,\r\nhalf mad with pain from the stings of that infernal fly, and one of our\r\nsailor servants lay on the ground, refusing to move, and begging us\r\nwith tears to put a rifle to his head and end his agony.\r\n\r\nThis Isle of Groix swarmed with creatures that had come over the ice\r\nfrom the mainland in the winter season. Its steep edges, covered with\r\nan impenetrable arborescent growth, enclosed a great treeless plateau,\r\na \"lande.\" We used to get on to this lande by walking up the bed of a\r\nrivulet, and once on it we had perfect massacres of winged game,\r\nespecially of that sort of gray grouse called ptarmigan by the English.\r\nIt was these birds' pairing season. They never flew away, and when we\r\nkilled one the other would ruffle up its feathers in a fury and fly\r\npecking at our legs. The wooded sides of the island must have been full\r\nof reindeer, to judge by the quantities of tracks to be seen on every\r\nside. If we had had one or two hounds to send into the thickets we\r\nmight have made hecatombs of them.\r\n\r\nFrom Le Croc I went round all our neighbouring fishing stations--Saint\r\nJulien, the Baie Rouge, &c. Cod were extraordinarily numerous that\r\nyear. One haul of the seine at the Baie Rouge brought in eighty-four\r\nthousand cod-fish in one day. It was the golden age of the fishery. Now\r\nthe fish have deserted the eastern coast of Newfoundland. Our fishermen\r\nhave to take their boats and anchor on the big bank, and there they\r\nstay for months, tossed about by every tempest. They go out\r\nline-fishing in small boats, which are frequently lost in the fog and\r\nnever heard of again. Often, too, the fishing vessel herself is cut in\r\ntwo, in fog or darkness, by some transatlantic liner steaming seventeen\r\nknots an hour, which is out of sight in a few seconds, while the\r\nunlucky boat founders with all hands. A hard and a risky life our bank\r\nfishermen lead. But they come back men, and well-seasoned men too!\r\n\r\nFrom the eastern coast of the island the Bette-Poule took her way to\r\nthe western side, passing through the Straits of Belleisle, a narrow\r\nchannel which parts Newfoundland from Labrador. The amount of difficult\r\nnavigation we met with going through the straits was really\r\nextraordinary. The channel was full of ice-floes, either stranded or\r\ndriven about by the currents. A thick fog came down on us, with\r\nzenithal aurora borealis, the electric action of which threw out every\r\ncompass, standard and otherwise, on board. No seeing, no steering!\r\nAfter having been in a very critical position at the entrance of\r\nForteau Bay, a point on the Labrador coast celebrated for wrecks, I\r\ntook the frigate into the haven of Ingornachoix, where we made some\r\nconsiderable stay, necessitated by the condition of my crew's health.\r\nFor some time it had been suffering from the exceptional fatigues of\r\nthe cruise. During our stay in Le Croc, in spite of its being a\r\nbreathing time, and of every kind of care, many men had been ailing,\r\nand the sickness ended by taking the form of a somewhat serious\r\nepidemic of smallpox. The best thing we could do to stop the mischief\r\nand prevent it from increasing and becoming permanent (which would have\r\nresulted in closing almost all foreign ports to us) was to isolate the\r\nsick. I therefore lost no time in having a hospital constructed on a\r\npretty wooded isle, which lay just at the entrance to the place where\r\nwe were anchored, and in it I settled all my sick men, doing everything\r\nin my power to dry and disinfect the frigate meanwhile. This double\r\nmeasure was successful, and when we left the bay my crew was completely\r\nrestored to health and vigour.\r\n\r\nI learnt several things during this long period in harbour, the first\r\nof which was the discovery of the immense quantity of lobsters\r\nfrequenting the coast. The first day my men went to walk on shore they\r\nbrought back nine hundred, which they had caught among the rocks, and\r\nthat without the least difficulty. I do not know whether the\r\nIngornachoix lobster was like Bayard, without reproach, but without\r\nfear he most certainly was. It was quite enough, when one caught sight\r\nof him in shallow water, to poke a stick at him. He instantly sprang\r\nfuriously forth, laid hold of it with his claws, and absolutely refused\r\nto let go. This abundance of lobsters, turned to commercial account\r\nlater, when it became known, gave rise to the Lobster Fisheries\r\nQuestion, one of the stalking-horses of the English Irredentists.\r\nFurthermore, I discovered that since the codfish were becoming rare on\r\nthe French Shore of the Straits of Belleisle, our fishermen, to remedy\r\nthe scarcity, went over and poached on the English coast of\r\nLabrador--the principal drawback to which contravention of the\r\nagreement was that it gave the English a pretext for doing the same\r\nthing. As the English cruisers not unnaturally shut their eyes to\r\nirregularities which created precedents that might be harmful to us,\r\nour ships of war had either to sanction them by their presence, or, by\r\nopposing them, to exercise in a foreign country a right of keeping\r\norder which was questionable, to say the least of it; both of them\r\nthings to be avoided, if possible. And our orders, in fact, were never\r\nto be seen at Labrador. This regulation I conformed to; but behold, one\r\nfine day, a schooner from our local station at St. Pierre Miquelon\r\ncasts anchor alongside of me, and the following colloquy ensues between\r\nthe lieutenant in command and myself:--\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"To Labrador.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you know the state of things. There are the gravest objections to\r\ntaking one of our warships there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know; but I have special and precise orders from the Minister for\r\nNaval Affairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"What orders?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been ordered to go to Labrador to buy a dog for one of the\r\nsecretaries to the minister.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what you have been sent from St. Pierre Miquelon for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nI had to bow to this. I could not set up my authority as\r\ncommander-in-chief against that of the minister, so let the schooner go\r\non her compromising mission. Soon after, and not without regret, I set\r\nsail to continue our cruise Time had passed swiftly by, between the\r\nattention of every kind the health of the crew had necessitated, the\r\ndrill of every sort we had devoted ourselves to, and the gun practice\r\nin the virgin forest, during which the ancient trees had been mown down\r\nby our projectiles We had lived a Robinson Crusoe sort of life on the\r\nlargest scale--it is a sort of life I have always had a weakness for.\r\nAfter building our hospital, we had made limekilns for disinfecting the\r\nfrigate, we had been wood-cutters, and charcoal burners, and\r\ncarpenters. We had made ourselves spare masts and spars. We had drained\r\nponds too; explored in all directions, hunting and fishing, and\r\ndiscovered lakes and rivers.\r\n\r\nThough we made good bags during these excursions, they consisted of\r\nsmall game only. Once I fired at, and to my deep regret I missed, a\r\nsilver fox--the animal dressed by nature in the richest and rarest of\r\nall her furs. There were abundant tracks of bear and caribou. We caught\r\nsight once of a huge gray wolf, striped like a zebra. But none of these\r\nlarger beasts fell to our guns. We could not have got at them even with\r\nhounds, so continuously far stretching and impenetrable the forest was,\r\nand the only thing we had to help us was Fox, the ship's dog, an\r\nexcellent pointer by the way, the pet of everybody on board. He fell\r\ninto the sea one day when there was a strong breeze, and was picked up,\r\nstill swimming sturdily along to catch up the frigate, on board of\r\nwhich he had a regular ovation when he got back.\r\n\r\nWe wound up our Newfoundland cruise with St. George's Bay, the last on\r\nthe French Shore, and the only point at which any difficulty was raised\r\nabout the exercise of our rights. We there found, in fact, a large\r\nfast-growing and increasingly prosperous Anglo-Canadian village, and in\r\nthe presence of its inhabitants we went through the ceremony of\r\nformally forbidding them to fish, which ceremony was greeted by\r\nprotests both amicable and bantering. Amicable, because half the\r\npopulation were French Canadians, talking our own language with a\r\nstrong St. Malo accent, and in spite of everything else, the similarity\r\nof origin, language, religion, and habits, established friendly\r\nrelations between us and them. Bantering, because first of all our\r\nfishermen no longer frequented St. George, and secondly, because the\r\nprohibition, which was compulsory during the four or five days in the\r\nyear during which our warships were present, became simply a dead\r\nletter during the other three hundred and six days of the year. It was\r\neasy, of course, to see that our exclusive right to fish could not be\r\nmaintained when once a sufficient indigenous population had settled\r\nthere, but it was no less easy to judge that some local arrangement\r\nconcerning these exceptional places, conciliating every interest, might\r\neasily be made. Would that be possible nowadays, when electioneering\r\npalaver has embittered the whole business? After leaving St. George, we\r\nspent a long time hunting for our colony of St. Pierre Miquelon in\r\ncontinuous fogs, and only succeeded in finding it by means of a plan of\r\nmy own invention. The weather happening to be moderate, I had several\r\ntriangular soundings made while we were under sail, and then\r\nendeavoured to make the mathematical triangle thus obtained tally as to\r\ndepth and nature of bottom with Captain Lavaud's chart of the\r\nNewfoundland soundings. So excellent is the chart in question, that the\r\nplan was successful, and gave us bearings by which we got a direct line\r\nfor the shore. St. Pierre Miquelon is a bare, wild, hideous islet, but\r\nwith a first-class port. Admirable as a victualling station and mart\r\nfor our fishermen, its military value as far as our trade is concerned\r\nis absolutely nil. Whatever may be done for it, it will always be at\r\nthe mercy of whoever is master of the seas in time of war.\r\n\r\nAt Halifax, whither I went to meet the officer commanding the British\r\nnaval station, we were put into quarantine on account of three\r\nconvalescents, relics of the epidemic we had been suffering from. But\r\nit was taken off, thanks to the generous intervention of the\r\nGovernor-General of Nova Scotia, Lord Falkland, a splendid-looking man,\r\nwell known in Parisian society. Nobody could have been more obliging\r\nnor kinder than this \"grand seigneur\" and his wife, the daughter of\r\nWilliam IV., were to us.\r\n\r\nIf Nova Scotia as seen from the sea, with its gloomy coast guarded by\r\nnumberless black reefs, recalls that of Brittany, the same resemblance\r\nstrikes the traveller who pushes towards the interior of the country,\r\nthrough its deep and smiling bays; and Halifax Bay in particular, when\r\nits fresh and verdant surroundings are lighted up by brilliant\r\nsunshine, leaves nothing to be desired in the way of charm. I saw it\r\nthus when I arrived, in all the excitement of a regatta, with the\r\npeculiar feature of a race for birch-bark canoes, paddled with\r\nincredible vigour by Mic Mac squaws, or Indian women, in blue blouses\r\nand floating black hair. What a splendid colony Nova Scotia is, too!\r\n\r\nThe advance post of the huge Canadian territory, protected by its\r\nalmost insular position from the rigours of the northern climate, with\r\nall its ports open (not only Halifax, where the fleets of the whole\r\nworld could find absolute safety, maritime and strategic, at once, but\r\nSydney too, surrounded by immense beds of coal), while the St Lawrence\r\nis still choked with ice.\r\n\r\nOur short stay in port was wound up by a great dinner given by my\r\ngunroom officers to those of the English frigate Winchester. The meal\r\nwas of the merriest, if I may judge by the toasts, the cheers, and the\r\nsongs I heard; and the merriment continued on shore, whither the young\r\npeople betook themselves together. One of the English midshipmen, a\r\ngood-looking lad with a thick crop of carroty hair, returned on board\r\nhis own ship with beautiful jet black locks, to the great astonishment\r\nof the first lieutenant; while I beheld two of my cadets appear at a\r\nball given by the officers of the garrison and indulge in such a\r\nremarkable style of dancing, that I was forced to give them immediate\r\norders to return on board the Belle-Poule. One of these cadets, by the\r\nway, was a Turk, called Saly. His story was rather a strange one. He\r\nwas the son of Saly Pasha, the pasha of Athens, and was a child in his\r\nmother's arms when the city was carried by assault by the Greeks and\r\ntheir philhellenic supporters, in I know not which year of the Greek\r\ninsurrection. All the defenders were put to the sword, and in the\r\nexcitement of the fight Saly's mother was murdered, but she had\r\nstrength, as she died, to throw her infant into the arms of a\r\nWurtembergian officer. He, much embarrassed by the gift, passed the\r\nchild on, having previously christened it Gottlieb, to a French naval\r\nlieutenant of the name of Quernel, who commanded a vessel off that\r\ncoast. When Quernel returned to Toulon, my Aunt Adelaide heard the\r\nincident mentioned. She interested herself in the little Turk, and had\r\nhim brought up amongst us. The boy turned out well, entered the navy,\r\nand was a post captain when he died. From Halifax we went to New York,\r\nthe frantic bustle and stir in which place contrasted strangely, in my\r\neyes, with the calm of the Newfoundland deserts and the placidity of\r\nthe Blue Noses, as the inhabitants of Nova Scotia are nicknamed. We\r\nwere at New York to do some indispensable revictualling, consequent on\r\nthe exceptionally rough voyage we had had. Besides much other damage,\r\nwe had lost all our sails; they had been carried away one after the\r\nother, and it was absolutely necessary to have at least one set in good\r\ntrim, instead of the patched rags still remaining to us, before\r\nundertaking our winter voyage across the ocean.\r\n\r\nI took advantage of the time these repairs took up to go and pay my\r\nrespects to the President at Washington and thence to make a rapid dash\r\ninto the West, in the footsteps of our ancient pioneers, and up to the\r\nfarthest limits of civilisation (as they were then, in 1841).\r\n\r\nThe thing that strikes one most on arriving in the United States, and\r\nin New York in particular, as I have already said, is the extraordinary\r\nbustle that reigns everywhere, and which really stuns one at first. One\r\nfeels so bewildered that any idea of a picturesque description\r\ndisappears. The only thing one is aware of is bustle. Bustle on land,\r\nwhere everybody seems to rush as if they were demented--bustle on the\r\nwater, where one keeps wondering why the ships of all sizes passing at\r\nfull speed in every direction do not collide every other minute. In\r\ncomplete contrast to our boulevards, Broadway, when you walk along it,\r\ndoes not seem to contain a single idler. Are there any idle men in\r\nAmerica? Yes, there are some millionaires, who pull up when they have\r\nmade their fortunes. Their fellow-citizens assert that they are always\r\nill at ease, amidst the general activity, and that they go and settle\r\ndown in their idleness in Paris, among people like themselves, whose\r\nfrivolity they end by copying. They are looked upon as \"demoralised\r\nAmericans.\" But they are few in number. As each man has only himself to\r\nreckon on, as he has no hoped-for inheritance to wait for and discount\r\nin idleness, seeing the man in possession owes nothing to his children,\r\nnor to anybody else, and is free to dispose of his property as he\r\nchooses, everybody being free to make his will as he likes, so each man\r\nfeels that if he wants to get on he must work. And is not this the\r\nchief cause of the vigour and energy of the great American nation? If\r\nBroadway is a tumult of business, that in the port of New York is worth\r\nseeing too. This port is at the confluence of two arms of the sea, in\r\nfront of the public walk called the Battery. Here, towards five o'clock\r\nin the evening, when the steamboats start, the huge floating palaces\r\nmay be seen shooting off in every direction, shrieking hoarsely. It is\r\na maritime pandemonium. In it the American is in his element. Dressed\r\nin black, with a stove-pipe hat, the quid in his cheek causing him to\r\nlook as though he grinned sardonically, with one hand on the steering\r\nwheel and the other on the engine-room bell, he drives his ship full\r\nspeed through the throng with an audacity, decision, and coolness which\r\nmade me shiver at first!\r\n\r\nIn this manner I left New York and passed along the coast of New Jersey\r\non my way to Washington, but not without receiving a very friendly\r\nwelcome from the naval officer commanding there, Commodore Perry, a\r\nremarkable man, who, half by persuasion and half by force, concluded\r\nthe first treaty with Japan, thus opening up that interesting\r\ncountry--I will not say to civilisation (for I do not know that Japan\r\nhas progressed on that account), but to trade, and intercourse with\r\nnations of European origin.\r\n\r\nIn the very first train I got into I found myself opposite a big man\r\nwearing a moustache and imperial, with a huge walking stick between his\r\nlegs, and was told he was the King, or rather Prince, Murat. Next we\r\npassed a fine country property belonging to King Joseph Buonaparte, and\r\ninvoluntarily I thought of a certain passage in the works of Voltaire,\r\nwhere Candide meets all the dethroned kings at Venice. There were\r\nothers even then whose names I might have added to those of Murat and\r\nJoseph, and the number was to be increased before long. \"Special line\r\nof Paris goods,\" we might almost say, in commercial phrase! Has this\r\nsort of export trade answered with us?\r\n\r\nI saw Philadelphia once more, as charming as ever. There was a fine\r\nperformance, that night, in the Chestnut Street Theatre, and I had sent\r\nto take places for it. But when I arrived I saw a huge poster over the\r\ndoor--\"Prince de Joinville at 8.30,\" and beat an instant and hasty\r\nretreat. As soon as I got to Washington I repaired to the White House\r\nto pay my respects to General Tyler. He was a blunt-spoken man with a\r\nbig nose, who had successively filled the posts of governor of his own\r\nState (Virginia) and of President of the United States, in each case in\r\nconsequence of the death of the actual incumbents, whose deputy he was.\r\nHe could not have done better in a hereditary monarchy! Our time at\r\nWashington was taken up with an interchange of compliments of all\r\nsorts. A dinner at the President's, visits to and from the diplomatic\r\ncorps, a huge reception, at which I shook hands at least three thousand\r\ntimes, at the White House. And bouquets, too, in the \"language of\r\nflowers!\"\r\n\r\nWe paid a visit, too, to the Naval Arsenal. A very nice little arsenal\r\nit was, in a bad situation, but admirably arranged, and only put in\r\nthat particular place to serve as a sort of school of elementary\r\ninstruction to the ignorance of Congress, and interest its members in\r\nnaval matters. When I say Congress, I should rather say the Chamber of\r\nRepresentatives. In the United States the Senate is the body which has\r\nthe real power, and which actually governs. This assembly, very few in\r\nnumbers, especially at the time of which I speak, chosen by the\r\nChamber, and of which the members were almost invariably re-elected,\r\nhad leisure to learn the necessities of administrative government and\r\nto become a permanent body, whose action was both lasting and\r\nintelligent, like the Council of Ten at Venice or the committee of the\r\nComedie Franjaise. But the Representative Chamber, full as it was of\r\njournalists, who had never studied anything beyond the art of\r\nattracting subscriptions to their papers, knew nothing whatever.\r\nLuckily it only formed a second wheel in the Constitution, but, in\r\nspite of that fact, anything likely to add to its enlightenment was\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\nI left Washington highly gratified with my reception, but glad to have\r\ngot it over, and carried away a most agreeable recollection of our\r\nminister, M. de Bacourt, a most delightfully witty man--a family\r\nvirtue, it would seem, to judge by his niece and grand-niece, Madame de\r\nMirabeau and Madame de Martel (Gyp).\r\n\r\nFrom Washington I went to Buffalo, the train running off the rails on\r\nthe way, and that, too, on a viaduct, on which the engine, having\r\nbroken through the roadway, was hung up in the framework, like a fly in\r\na spider's web. I was anxious to go, via the great lakes, to Green Bay\r\non Lake Michigan, and thence starting from Mackinaw, the old Indian\r\nMichillimackinac, to follow up the track of our officers and soldiers\r\nand missionaries, who pushed on till they discovered the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: a large ship on a river]\r\n\r\nIt was in 1672 that Talon, the Superintendent of \"La Nouvelle France,\"\r\nhaving heard from the Indians of the existence of a great river, sent\r\nout an expedition to discover it under Father Marquette, who had great\r\ninfluence over the Indian tribes. Crossing the great lakes, he landed\r\nat Green Bay, and pushing westwards, he soon reached the \"Father of\r\nWaters.\" It was for Green Bay that I too embarked, at Buffalo, on Lake\r\nErie, on board the staunch steamer Columbus, the last boat to go to\r\nthat place so late in the season (in mid-winter). Our boat was staunch\r\nindeed, some consolation for the slowness of her pace. Of this she soon\r\ngave us proof, for she ran with an awful shock, going eight knots an\r\nhour in the dark, on to a reef of rocks, stopped short, and heeled\r\nover. A big wave caught her and lifted her a second time; there was\r\nanother bump. But with the third wave she got across the reef. I rushed\r\ntowards the engine, thinking everything must be smashed and the side of\r\nthe ship gaping open. But no, not at all!\r\n\r\nThe captain, who had been taken aback for a moment, merely sent his\r\nquid from one cheek to the other, without saying a word. The whole\r\nthing was over. And, indeed, that was not the only unforeseen incident\r\nduring our voyage. We spent one whole night aground in the St. Clair\r\nLake. Nothing I can say will give any idea of the recklessness with\r\nwhich the ship was navigated. To begin with, there were no charts; you\r\nwent at haphazard, according to information that had come down by\r\ntradition, and yet these lakes are really small oceans, with currents,\r\nand fogs, and squalls coming off the coasts, just like the sea. The\r\nnavigation must have been just the same in 1679, when Lassalle, an\r\nofficer in the Canadian army, launched the first ship, which he called\r\nthe Griffon, in honour of the griffin in the arms of his commanding\r\nofficer, the Marquis de Frontenac.\r\n\r\nTo danger by sea must be added danger by fire for our staunch Columbus.\r\nThe boilers were heated with wood--aloewood--out of which pencils and\r\ncigar-boxes are made. It made a very pleasant smell, but being piled up\r\npell mell in the hold, against the furnaces, it caught fire several\r\ntimes in my presence, and the stokers would just throw a little water\r\non it to put it out. On the deck the very high pressure engine worked\r\nexposed and unprotected, amidst sheep and oxen and packages of all\r\nkinds, which were frequently shot against it by the roll of the waves,\r\nand above the whole there rose two stories of cabins, built of light\r\nplanking, as thin as paper, quite incapable of standing against the\r\nmost moderate seas, but which caught the wind, and made the ship\r\nexceedingly unsteady. During a squall, luckily for us a short one,\r\nwhich caught us on Lake Michigan, in the middle of the night, the whole\r\nfabric began to give way. I was woke by the water coming in and the\r\ncrackling sound of the damage going on in all directions. So I got up,\r\nand found all the Americans on board wearing lifebelts, and greeting me\r\nwith the remark, \"Sir, you are a sailor, but there are more risks on\r\nour lakes than on the ocean!\" and quite right they were.\r\n\r\nIt was a long passage, and we put in to several places on our way.\r\nFirst into Detroit, formerly the French Fort Pontchartrain, and now\r\nbecome the capital of Michigan State. Opposite Detroit runs the\r\nCanadian shore, to which we are borne by a steam ferry boat, and where\r\nthe same contrast strikes me as at Niagara. On the American side I find\r\na very pretty town, with all the comforts of civilisation, a scene of\r\nhard-working activity. On the Canadian shore I see a village of poor\r\ncottages, surrounded with apple orchards, like a village in Normandy,\r\nin front of which the red sentry marches up and down, as stiff as an\r\nautomaton. The inhabitants of the said village, French both in feature\r\nand appearance, hurried up in delight when they heard us speaking the\r\nlanguage of their forefathers. \"It's the only tongue we know. We don't\r\nwant our children to learn any other!\" And yet they have been English\r\nfor over a century! A strange contrast, indeed, this fidelity to the\r\nmemory of their national origin, to their not less sincere fidelity to\r\nthe conquering regime, which assures to them the right of willing their\r\nproperty as they choose, and has freed them from the administrative\r\ntyranny which seems, unfortunately, to cling to us under every regime.\r\n\r\nFrom Detroit we went up the St. Clair River to Lake Huron. The great\r\nriver was a magnificent sight, with its banks covered with mighty\r\nforests in all the splendour of their autumnal colouring. Here and\r\nthere, on the American side, stood some log cabin, an emigrant's first\r\nshelter. Then we would come on a sawmill, that first of all necessaries\r\nin such a country. On the British side now and again, we saw Indian\r\nwigwams, Huron or Chippewa. At the entrance of Lake Huron bad weather\r\ncame on; it snowed, and we took shelter in a bay, where we moored the\r\nship to the shore close to one of those American forts that fringe the\r\nIndian frontier. They are all alike, these forts; a battlemented wall\r\nof thick planks, with banquettes for riflemen, and loopholed for\r\nheavier guns. Within each are the barracks and the officers' quarters.\r\nThis particular fort was called Fort Gratiot. In 1688 its name was Fort\r\nSt. Joseph, and it had a French garrison, commanded by Baron de Houtou.\r\nDuring this stoppage we had an amusing adventure. Our only fellow\r\npassengers on the Columbus, some five or six in number, were an\r\nAmerican officer on his way to take command at Fort Winnepeg; a\r\nMethodist missionary and his wife, who spent the day singing hymns\r\ntogether, and retired to their cabin at night with all the eagerness of\r\nthe most enthusiastic fondness; a young dressmaker going to join her\r\nfamily at Green Bay; and finally, Miss Mary, the chambermaid, a\r\nhandsome, fair, freckled girl, liked by everybody on board. Tired of\r\nbeing on shipboard, the whole band of passengers, male and female, and\r\nMiss Mary into the bargain, went off to walk and amuse themselves on\r\nshore. Suddenly the people in the fort got wind of our presence. The\r\nmajor commanding and his officers hastened up, asking where the prince\r\nwas, and invited us all into the fort, to rest and refresh ourselves\r\nwith them. It was impossible to refuse such a kind and cordial\r\ninvitation. It was equally impossible to break up our party--that would\r\nhave been unmannerly, and contrary to American ideas of propriety and\r\nequality alike. So we entered a drawing-room, in which the wives and\r\ndaughters of the officers quartered in the fort were assembled. They\r\nseemed to falter for a moment, when they beheld our lady companions.\r\nThey scanned the Methodist and his wife, and took their measure at once\r\nBut the dressmaker and Miss Mary, hanging on the arms of two of my\r\ncompanions, seemed to puzzle them. Anyhow they hastened towards them,\r\ntook them by the hand, led them to the place of honour on the sofa, and\r\nbegan the conversation with \"Do you speak English?\" I don't recollect\r\nnow how it all went off, but I know we were soon back on board, Miss\r\nMary and all, under a salute of twenty-one guns.\r\n\r\nMackinaw, a small wooded island, with high shores, and a fort over\r\nwhich the stars and stripes of the Union floated, looked very\r\npicturesque as we approached it. There was a ruin on one side of the\r\nAmerican guard-house, to which we lost no time in climbing through the\r\nwoods. It was the old French fort, and our hearts swelled at the\r\nthought that the French flag was the first to float over this little\r\nGibraltar, when, some hundred and sixty years previously, our officers\r\ntook possession of this magnificent country in the name of their king.\r\n\r\nOnce more, with the eye of fancy, we saw our white-coated soldiers\r\nmounting guard on those ramparts, whence their gaze must have wandered\r\nover the confluence of the three great lakes and the immense empire\r\nthey had won for France, while the Indian tribes hurried from all\r\nquarters to bend the knee to the Great Chief of the Pale Faces. It was\r\na great and glorious epoch; and what traveller would not feel deeply\r\nstirred when he comes upon such bitter memories of the vanished\r\ngrandeur of his country?\r\n\r\nOur good ship Columbus got to Green Bay at last, and, stirring up the\r\nmud which obstructs the entrance to Fox River, bore us up that fine\r\nstream and deposited us in front of a large store, surrounded by fifty\r\nhouses, there or thereabouts. This settlement was not in the United\r\nStates, but on Wisconsin Territory, an embryo State, not populous\r\nenough as yet, nor sufficiently organised, to be called a State, nor\r\nhave a voice in the deliberations of the American Union. The country on\r\nthe left bank of the Fox River was not even a Territory; it was a\r\nNo-Man's Land, where any man might settle where and how he pleased.\r\nLike all the places I had passed through, Green Bay, the \"Baie Verte\"\r\nof our forefathers (and it still deserves its title) was occupied in\r\nthe first instance by the French. After Father Marquette's exploring\r\njourney, twenty soldiers, two sergeants, and four bandsmen, under the\r\ncommand of Lieutenant du Roussel, were sent thither in 1684 by M. de\r\nBeauchamptrelle, commanding the king's troops at Mackinaw. Now, as I\r\nhave said, it possessed a hotel and about fifty houses, inhabited for\r\nthe most part by merchants trading with the Redskins. Everybody talked\r\nFrench, and everybody hastened forward when the boat arrived to ask for\r\nnews from the civilised world.\r\n\r\nA few Indians, silent and motionless, wrapped in their blankets, looked\r\non indifferently at the bustle. Squaws shod with moccasins, and the\r\ntoes of their little feet turned in, passed by without raising their\r\nheads, their papooses sitting astride on their backs. The somewhat\r\nnumerous Indian tribes inhabiting the country were the Menomenis, the\r\nWinnepeg Indians, and the Iroquois, which last had emigrated from\r\nCanada to escape the English yoke. I much regretted not having time to\r\npay a visit to their wigwams. To the very last they were our most\r\ndevoted allies in our wars with the English. I had a talk with one of\r\nthe chiefs sons, who told me he still had Montcalm's sword in his\r\npossession, and preserved it as a sacred relic. According to his story,\r\nduring the battle of Quebec, probably just at the moment when Montcalm\r\nwas mortally wounded, his sword was hung up in a tree, whence it was\r\ntaken by one of his faithful Indian followers, and it has always\r\nremained with his tribe. After a great deal of difficulty we succeeded\r\nin procuring saddle horses for ourselves, and a farmer's waggon for our\r\nbaggage, and we set forth for the Mississippi. The whole journey was\r\nmost interesting. There were no roads--the merest track through woods\r\ninterspersed with prairies--along which we went to the lake and fort of\r\nWinnepeg. Beyond that lake we knew there would be nothing but prairie,\r\nstretching far and wide, over which we must steer as though we were at\r\nsea, or else be guided by the mysterious instinct of some trapper. We\r\nmet many Redskins in the woods, all busy hunting. Game was very\r\nabundant--waterfowl on the streams, flights of prairie hens (a sort of\r\ngrouse), and herds of buck, which constantly crossed our line of march\r\nHere and there was a clearing or first attempt at cultivation, round a\r\nsquatter's log cabin.\r\n\r\nWe were following the first skirmishing line of that army of\r\ncivilisation which is overrunning in its steady advance all that wild\r\ncountry which was once the Indian's sole domain. When this advance\r\nguard collects at any given point, a hotel rises, and beside it the\r\nstore where a trader will deal in every kind of merchandise, and\r\nespecially in brandy, that most destructive of poisons to all\r\nindigenous races. After the hotel will come the bank, and then the\r\nchurch and school, and before long the whole will grow into a village\r\nor town, of which the United States will take possession by law. As for\r\nthe original squatters, they will make over their log cabins and their\r\nbits of cultivation to new arrivals, of more sedentary tastes than\r\ntheir own, and will move on further, with their wives and children, to\r\nmake a fresh settlement, often exchanging rifle shots with the Redskins\r\nthe while, in some spot where they can find that absolute independence\r\nwhich they prize above all other goods. Thus does the tide of\r\ncivilisation, which shall soon cover the whole American continent, move\r\nceaselessly onward.\r\n\r\nBut on our own particular road we had got no further than the\r\nsquatters, and of them, after the day's march was over, we asked a\r\nhospitality which was always cordially granted.\r\n\r\nThey were an energetic and a singular race. Here you might come on a\r\npupil from West Point (the military and polytechnic school of the\r\nUnited States), a former captain in the army, who had married an Indian\r\nwife, and had to learn French to make himself understood by her and the\r\nother Indians in the neighbourhood, who could speak no other language.\r\nA whole family of little half-breeds, more red than white, swarmed\r\nabout him. There again, both father and mother would be white-skinned,\r\nwitn splendid children, whom the mother rocked to sleep in the\r\nintervals of preparing an excellent dinner for us with a haunch of\r\nvenison we had bought from an Indian who had just killed a buck. Their\r\nlog cabin, like all the others, indeed, consisted of one large room\r\nbelow, with a big fireplace on which perfect tree trunks were burning,\r\nand a loft above it. In these lofts passing travellers like ourselves\r\nslept. And they were not over warm, for the doors and windows only\r\nfitted tolerably, and the weather was frosty. In the evening the sons\r\nof the house--huge fellows who crushed your hand when they shook it,\r\nand who used their axes as well as they used their guns--would come in\r\nfrom work, and the evenings would be spent sitting smoking and talking\r\nround the fire.\r\n\r\n\"There are a great many Indians still,\" I was told, \"and they are\r\nrather turbulent; they killed a white man quite lately. The squatters\r\nare very far apart too. But then we haven't to bother our heads or put\r\nourselves out because of anybody.\"\r\n\r\nAt one place, called Fond du Lac, the house was somewhat less primitive\r\nthan at our previous halting-places. Our host was a doctor of\r\ncultivated mind, living alone with his family, of whom two, girls, were\r\nvery pretty. They made us a cranberry tart, on the memory of which my\r\ngrateful palate lingers yet. The worthy doctor was armed to the teeth,\r\nfor he had no white neighbours, and over two hundred Indians, so he\r\ntold me, prowling around him. He lent me a gun, with which I went out\r\nshooting, and as a matter of fact I did meet a considerable number of\r\nRedskins. As long as they can find game, and here it was plentiful,\r\nthey are, as a rule, tolerably inoffensive. Yet these were the remnant\r\nof warlike tribes which had never been thoroughly subjugated, and there\r\nwas a hill, not very far off, called \"Deadman's Butts,\" in memory of a\r\nfight waged between them and the French army, backed by three thousand\r\nChippewa Indians, which ended in a terrible massacre. Notwithstanding\r\nthe presence of such neighbours, my host had chosen the spot where he\r\nhad pitched his tent right well, for I saw on a map of Wisconsin, which\r\nI chanced to look at many years later, that Fond du Lac had become a\r\ntown, with railways running to and from it.\r\n\r\nLeaving Fond du Lac, we found ourselves on the prairie, stretching wide\r\nas far as the eye could see; dry yellowish grass (it was the end of\r\nOctober) covered the slightly undulating plain, with here and there a\r\nscanty clump of trees. It constitutes the plateau (not a very high one)\r\nwhich separates the Mississippi river system from that of the St.\r\nLawrence. Our horses cantered gaily over the frozen ground. All at once\r\nwe saw a big animal running away from us at a kind of amble. We urged\r\nforward our mounts in pursuit, and got up just in time to see it enter\r\na clump of brushwood, not fifty paces across. An Indian, who acted as\r\nour guide, went into the thicket after it, gun in hand. A dreadful\r\nroar, which terrified our horses, was followed by the appearance of the\r\ninfuriated animal. It was a puma, or panther without spots, which\r\ngalloped in a circle round M. de Montholon's horse, and then retreated\r\ninto a larger clump of trees, where we thought it prudent to leave it,\r\nas our only arm was a single-barrelled small-bore rifle. Somewhat\r\nfurther on we saw a big cloud gather on the horizon and rapidly\r\napproach us. The prairie was on fire. We then took the well-known plan\r\nof setting it on fire ourselves just where we were. Within less than\r\nfive minutes our fire had run a mile before the wind, going as fast as\r\na horse can gallop, with a noise like a distant rattle of musketry. We\r\nand our horses entered the space we had set on fire ourselves, while\r\nthe big conflagration in the distance, finding no food in front, fled\r\naway to our right and left. I afterwards saw the same sight at night.\r\nIt was most beautiful.\r\n\r\nAs we neared the Mississippi we got into less wild country. I remember\r\nthe first hotel where the host said to me, \"You have come just in good\r\ntime. You'll have something out of the common for dinner. We have been\r\nkilling a sheep.\" Since leaving Green Bay we had been living\r\nexclusively on venison and prairie hens and wild duck. A sheep was a\r\ngreat rarity. We came upon the Mississippi at Galena in Illinois, so\r\ncalled on account of its lead mines. When I say mines, I use an\r\nexpression which was quite inappropriate at the time of my visit, for\r\nthe galena, or lead-ore, lay on the surface of the soil. You saw its\r\nmetallic brightness shining out everywhere, and so rich was the ore,\r\nthat it yielded seventy-five per cent. of lead, even under the most\r\nsummary of processes. Added to this fact, the expense of transport\r\nbeing infinitesimal, as the huge artery of the Mississippi River ran a\r\nfew paces from the beds, the working of them was so profitable that\r\nnobody took the trouble to extract the silver from it. But the result\r\nof this mineral wealth was that everything one eat and drank at Galena\r\nwas impregnated with lead, so much so, indeed, that one of my\r\ncompanions had a fainting fit, caused by the sediment which the eau de\r\nBotot he used for his toilet deposited in his glass. He thought he had\r\nbeen poisoned. I had not time, when I got to the Mississippi, to go\r\ndown it to New Orleans, like our soldiers and explorers, when they made\r\ntheir first journey across this splendid country, and by it united a\r\nFrench Canada with a French Louisiana. The journey I had just taken had\r\nlasted longer than I had thought for, and as my duty as a sailor\r\nrecalled me imperiously to my ship, my only thought was to rejoin her\r\nas soon as possible. But means of communication in the West were few\r\nand far between--railroads were unknown, roads hardly laid out. We were\r\nfain to go down the Mississippi to where the Ohio falls into it, go up\r\nthat river to Cincinnati, and thence get by mail-coach to the railroads\r\nin the older Atlantic States. This return journey was not altogether\r\nuneventful. Our boat, ran aground several times during the descent of\r\nthe Upper Mississippi. On one of these occasions we were delayed for\r\nsome time near the confluence of that stream with the DesMoines River,\r\nflowing through an exquisite country called Iowa, which in those days\r\nhad not yet been annexed by the Union. It swarmed with game. I remember\r\none shooting expedition I made with the ship's engineer, a young\r\nKentuckian of colossal stature. We flushed thousands of prairie hens\r\nand other creatures, on whom we poured a hot but harmless fire. In our\r\nown justification I must add that the Kentuckian was shooting with a\r\nbullet, using a huge carbine, so heavy that it took him half a minute\r\nto aim with it, and I with a single-barrelled gun, lent me by a\r\nbar-keeper, with this information, \"The barrel is all twisted. You must\r\naim three or four yards to the right, if you want to hit anything!\"\r\n\r\nThe territory of Iowa was still disputed for by squatters and Indians.\r\nThese latter, who exceeded the whites in number, belonged to a great\r\ntribe, both turbulent and warlike, the Saxes and the Foxes. They were\r\nat peace with the Government at the time I speak of, but a deputation\r\nof their chiefs, numbering thirty or forty, came on board our boat, on\r\ntheir way to Washington, where they desired to lay their grievances\r\nbefore the President. They arrived on board in full war paint, their\r\nfaces painted half red and half yellow, and their heads dressed, like a\r\ncuirassier's helmet, with horsehair and big feathers, their bodies\r\nnaked, but hung about with baubles, their legs thrust into leather\r\nbreeches, and big blankets over all. Their squaws were with them. They\r\nwere ugly, but the men were splendid, with the most resolute and\r\nimpassive countenances. They behaved with the greatest dignity while on\r\nboard, and never showed any excitement except just as we were passing\r\nby the confluence of the Missouri with the Mississippi. Whether it was\r\nsome superstitious feeling that attached itself to that spot, or the\r\nimpression made on them by the grandeur of the scene, the meeting of\r\nthe two great rivers forming a sort of lake, lighted up by a splendid\r\nsunset, I know not, but they all assembled in the stern of the boat,\r\nand repeated a sort of invocatory prayer. It was a perfect picture.\r\n\r\nI did no more than pass through St. Louis, already a large town and the\r\ncapital of Ohio. An accident happened to us as we were going up the\r\nOhio (\"La Belle Riviere\" of our forefathers), such as does not occur\r\nnowadays, when the Federal Government has caused the engineer\r\nregiments, which add to their other functions those of our \"ponts et\r\nchaussees,\" a simple and economical plan, worthy of general imitation,\r\nto clear the rivers of their different obstructions. We were snagged.\r\n\r\nHerewith I explain the expression and the fact. As a consequence of\r\ninundations and falling in of banks and such like, many big trees had,\r\nfrom time immemorial, been carried down the American rivers. Many of\r\nthese trees had ended by catching in the river beds by their roots.\r\nStripped of their branches, and sharpened to a point by the action of\r\nthe water, and bent sloping by the current, they formed, as it were,\r\nhuge invisible subaqueous chevaux de frise, on which steamers going up\r\nstream frequently impaled themselves, and this often to the destruction\r\nof the ship and great loss of life. We ran against one of these trees,\r\nsomewhat sideways luckily for us, but it stood up on end, and amid a\r\nfrightful noise, and a little momentary consternation, carried away one\r\npaddle box and wheel. A snag is only one of the numerous sources of\r\naccident in American river navigation. But one soon gets accustomed to\r\nthe carelessness of danger which characterises the Americans, and on\r\nthe whole travelling on their river steamers is very pleasant. The\r\nsleeping cabins are invariably clean and comfortable. On certain boats\r\nsome are very elegant. I have seen wedding cabins, that is to say\r\ncabins decorated all over with mirrors and brilliantly lighted up,\r\nintended for couples on their wedding journey. And truth compels me to\r\nstate that the strict regularity of these honeymoon couples is not too\r\nseverely inquired into.\r\n\r\nAt Cincinnati, the city of porkers, I took to the stage, at Pittsburg\r\nto the canal. Across the Alleghanies I travelled in a coach crammed\r\nwith passengers of both sexes. It was a merry journey, during which I\r\nwas ceaselessly haunted by memories of the little Danaids, and Pere\r\nLournois and his forty sons-in-law, getting out of the Auxerre coach to\r\nthe sound of the chimes of Dunkirk. \"Tutu ... tutu ... mon pere.\" At\r\nNew York I found the Belle-Poule done up as good as new, thanks to the\r\nexcellent care of my second in command, M. Charner. But before setting\r\nsail I had to get through a certain number of banquets, followed by\r\ntoasts, and even to go to Boston for a great ball in the old town hall,\r\ncalled the Faneuil Hall, the cradle of American Independence. I made my\r\nentry at that ball preceded and surrounded by an army of solemn\r\nstewards, wearing huge wigs, and with rather a good-looking woman, whom\r\nnobody knew, on my arm. She called herself America Vespuccia, and she\r\nbegan to swear like any heathen when somebody spilt a glass of lemonade\r\nover her fine velvet gown.\r\n\r\nThe Belle-Poule weighed anchor at last, but before we got past Sandy\r\nHook a snowstorm came on. We could not see a yard ahead, and in a few\r\nminutes we had a foot of snow on deck. The rest of our return voyage\r\nwas to match, in other words, it was awful. We ran, during its course,\r\none of those totally unforeseen risks of which a sailor's life is full,\r\nand which, once past, constitutes one of its chief charms. Let my\r\nreaders try the following experiment:--Put two small bits of paper in a\r\nbasin of water, and disturb the liquid. By what learned men call\r\ncapillary attraction the two scraps of paper draw nearer to each other\r\nand finally join together. It was this same capillary attraction which\r\nnearly lost me my frigate and another battleship, the Cassard, which\r\nwas our consort. A violent south-easterly squall had come down on us,\r\nand the sea was very heavy. All at once, just as night fell, over a sky\r\nas black as ink and an angry-looking sea, the wind suddenly dropped.\r\nThe Cassard, driven by the last puff of wind, and drawn too by\r\ncapillary attraction, had got very near us, and soon this nearness\r\nbecame alarming. We could not get about, for there was not a breath\r\nstirring. We could not launch boats in such a sea to try and tow the\r\nships apart. Soon the frigate and her consort were tossing convulsively\r\nin the heavy sea, with only the breadth of one wave between them. In\r\nanother moment they must crash into each other, and that at night, in\r\nmid-ocean, far from any succour. It was a solemn moment. Although one\r\nwatch had been sent to turn in, nobody had cared to stay below. All\r\nwere on deck, men and officers alike, with serious faces. The only\r\nsound to be heard was the noise of the sails flapping wildly against\r\nthe masts and my voice as I gave the other ship's captain his orders in\r\ncase a puff of wind should come from this quarter or that. Night had\r\ncome on, and in our heart of hearts we were both of us beginning to\r\ndespair, when the longed-for breath of wind came, and the ships drew\r\napart. Two hours later we were at the mercy of another gale, a\r\nnorth-westerly one this time, with a bitter frost, which would not have\r\nleft a timber of the Belle-Poule and the Cassard if they had been in\r\ncollision, but which gave me occasion once more to admire our brave\r\nsailors' courage and devotion. We had to set all sail so as to catch\r\nthe first puffs of wind. When the gale came on it became necessary to\r\nfurl them again. But having been soaked by the rain of the\r\nsouth-easterly storm, they had turned under the action of the frost\r\ninto perfect icicles. They cracked like glass, cutting the men's\r\nfingers and tearing out their nails. It was a frightfully difficult job\r\nto take in the maintop sail--a very heavy hempen one--which I had kept\r\nout as long as possible, and which had to be furled just when the storm\r\nwas at its worst. I watched my poor fellows clinging to the yard for\r\nover half an hour, shaken by the terrible gusts, and still not able to\r\nmanage it.\r\n\r\nAt midnight, when the watch changed, fearing that with limbs benumbed\r\nby the cold as theirs were, they would not be able even to continue\r\nholding on, I sent them orders to come on deck and let fresh men take\r\ntheir places. But no! they would not! and slowly, surely, they finished\r\ntheir work. Only when they got down from aloft they came on to the\r\nquarterdeck cap in hand, with bleeding, swollen hands and faces,\r\nsaying, \"Captain, we have taken the maintop sail in,\" with that\r\nindefinable but touching look that a man has who has done his duty to\r\nthe very end in spite of danger.\r\n\r\nMy brave sailors, I could have kissed them! But I did what they\r\nappreciated more than that! I had good hot mulled wine ready for them,\r\nand sent them to bed on it! Some days afterwards, in another gale,\r\nbetween two snow-showers, I saw that rare electric phenomenon called\r\nSt. Elmo's fire--jets of electric fire appearing at the points of all\r\nthe ship's masts and yards. A spontaneous, unexpected, and most\r\neffective illumination.\r\n\r\nAnd then we entered Toulon harbour, where we saluted the flag of\r\nAdmiral Hugon, commanding the squadron to which the Belle-Poule was\r\nabout to be attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n1842\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the squadron was to go into winter quarters at Toulon, and as the\r\nBELLE-POULE had to repair a great many damages, I went back to Paris\r\ntowards the end of January, 1842, and plunged joyfully into that most\r\nprecious of all possessions amidst the storms and vicissitudes of\r\npolitics, my home life. This notwithstanding, the pleasures of the gay\r\nworld, then a fairly brilliant one were by no means indifferent to me.\r\nThere was a numerous succession of festivities. My brother, the Duc\r\nd'Orleans, gave a magnificent fancy ball in the Pavillon Marsan. All\r\nthe elegant and artistic world of Paris was there, dressed either in\r\nhistorical costumes, faithfully copied from pictures in the museums, or\r\nelse in fantastic garments which especially set off the beauty of their\r\nfeminine wearers. Mesdames de Contades, de Murat, and Place had adopted\r\nEastern dress. Madame Thiers wore a rich moyen age costume; Madame de\r\nPlaisance headed a whole quadrille of hunters and huntresses. The\r\nComtesse Duhesme another, in which both gentlemen and ladies wore the\r\ncharming costumes brought into fashion by Giraud's picture, La\r\nPermission de Dix Heures. The beautiful Madame Liadieres shone in a\r\nquadrille of light cavalry men of the time of Louis XV, and\r\nshepherdesses dressed a la Pompadour. The foreigners and members of the\r\ndiplomatic body of both sexes were for the most part in dresses taken\r\nfrom their own national history. Among the artists, Eugene Sue,\r\nHenriquel-Dupont, Tony Johannot, and Louis Boulanger had chosen the\r\nstyle of Louis XIII. Eugene Delacroix wore a Moorish dress, Horace\r\nVernet an Arab costume. Winterhalter represented a Florentine of the\r\nfourteenth century, while Amaury Duval, Jadin, Eugene Lamy, Gudin,\r\nRaffet, &c., &c., were all got up with the most studied correctness.\r\nWhen we went into supper the band of my brother Aumale's regiment, the\r\n17th Light Infantry, transformed into a posse of Arab musicians,\r\nstationed on the staircase, played a whole series of Algerian airs,\r\nwhich the good fellows had learnt at Mouzala and Medeah, in the olive\r\nwoods, or under the blaze of the sun and the heat of the Arab fire. The\r\nguests took their seats round a table on which was the famous\r\ncentrepiece, executed after Chenavard's design, by Barye, Pradier,\r\nKlagman, Moine, my sister Marie, and by Ary Scheffer and Paul Delaroche\r\nas well, who laid aside their painters' brushes for the nonce, and\r\nwielded the sculptor's point. It was an admirable piece of work, worthy\r\nof Benvenuto Cellini, broken up, alas! cast to the four winds of\r\nheaven, and lost to France, after the revolution of February.\r\n\r\nThis fete was THE FETE of that winter. One of those unique and original\r\nentertainments the memory of which lingers with one for long. But there\r\nwere others besides.\r\n\r\nThe King gave a series of concerts and large and small dances every\r\nwinter. At these last only a very restricted number of guests\r\nassembled, chosen exclusively among the diplomatic body, the foreigners\r\nchancing to pass through Paris, and young dancing people, especially\r\nthose young ladies who ranked high for elegance and beauty. People used\r\nto crowd, at these small dances, to watch the Princess de Ligne dancing\r\nthe mazurka with her incomparable Polish grace; just as at the big\r\nballs, which were rather crushes, there would be a crowd, more curious\r\nthan admiring, to watch the steps and capers of the Prince de Craon,\r\nthe last remaining exponent of that pretentious school of dancing of\r\nwhich Trenis had been the leader, under the Directoire. These large\r\ncrowded balls used to be a great bore, especially to us, who had to\r\ntake it in turn to do the honours to the very end of the evening. Yet I\r\nrecollect laughing heartily one evening, when this duty had fallen to\r\nme, at seeing an officer of the National Guard, in his cocked hat and\r\nbig feather, whose vision had somewhat suffered from the supper he had\r\njust consumed, trying to insist on persuading the Suisse standing at\r\nthe door of the ball-room with his cross belts and halbert, to be his\r\npartner in the dance. He made frenzied attempts to drag him away, and\r\nonly interrupted them to try the seductive power of the most eccentric\r\nof dancing steps which he performed before him.\r\n\r\nNowadays the race known as the Grand Prix de Paris marks the close of\r\nwhat people are pleased to call the season. Under the July Monarchy it\r\nwas the \"Fete du Roi\" with its firework display, and its official\r\nreceptions, which were tiresome to the last degree. Revolutions may\r\nsucceed each other, governments may change, but all the tiresome things\r\ngo on for ever. Under the monarchy, the empire, or the republic alike,\r\nit is indispensable, so it would appear, that once in the year at\r\nleast, the diplomatic body, clergy, Chambers, officers of the land and\r\nsea forces, and companies and corporations of every kind, should pass\r\nbefore the chief ruler, whoever he may be, and make a series of\r\nofficial speeches to him, expressing good wishes which are for the most\r\npart utterly lacking in sincerity, and which the unlucky recipient is\r\nobliged to acknowledge in every sort of commonplace formula. My father\r\nhad quite a special talent for varying these answers of his, which he\r\nalways extemporised. They were taken down in shorthand, and made over\r\nto Vatout to have a final polish put on them before being sent to the\r\nMoniteur. The witty academician abhorred this duty, which he\r\nirreverently styled \"dressing the royal macaroni.\" For lay figures like\r\nmyself, the only interest about these receptions, which were\r\npractically got up for effect, lay in watching the personages we saw\r\npass. Two long-haired peers of France, who always were among the last\r\nof their Chamber to pass by, used to attract our attention\r\nparticularly. They were Victor Hugo and Montalembert; then among the\r\nmembers of the Paris Municipal Council, Victor Considerant, too, used\r\nto be pointed out to us. Then there was a member of the Institute in a\r\ngreen coat and black breeches, whose advent we looked forward to with\r\ndelight. This worthy gentleman used to come up with three or four\r\ndeputations in succession. He would arrive with the first, bow, applaud\r\nenthusiastically after the address, and then, while his deputation was\r\nleaving by the door of exit, he was stepping backwards to the entrance\r\ndoor to reappear with a second and third party, coming forward each\r\ntime with the same low bows and the same demonstrations of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAmong the general officers and diplomats out of active service who took\r\npart in these ceremonies, I used to remark two British admirals, Sir\r\nSydney Smith and Lord Cochrane, who never failed to attend. They had\r\neach had a brilliant career. The first, with Djezzar Pasha, had\r\ndefended St. Jean d'Acre against General Bonaparte's forces. The\r\nsecond, a tall, fine, bold-looking man, had covered himself with glory\r\nby the most gallant behaviour, both in Europe and Chili, where the\r\ntradition of his valour still survives. Both had done great service to\r\ntheir country, yet neither, it was said, could return to it. Wherefore?\r\n\r\nThe reception of the clergy had a quaintness all its own. The\r\narchbishop's discourse was invariably and utterly inaudible. Whether by\r\naccident, or by an unlucky coincidence, it was always drowned by the\r\nnoise of the tremendous morning serenade given in the courtyard by the\r\ntwelve or fifteen hundred drums of the National Guard and the Paris\r\ngarrison, all beating in unison under the guidance of a single\r\ndrum-major.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the evening, we had the clou of the performance, the\r\nreception of the diplomatic body. There was a certain amount of pomp\r\nabout it. The members of the corps assembled in a drawing-room near the\r\nPavillon Marsan, where a collation was prepared. Thence the King's\r\naides-de-camp went and fetched them, conducting them through all the\r\ngalleries of the Tuileries to the Throne-room, near the Pavilion de\r\nFlore. When all these ambassadors and ministers, with their suites,\r\nappeared at the door of the Throne-room, in their varied uniforms, all\r\nglistening in the candle-light, and slowly moved towards the King, with\r\nthree successive bows, the scenic effect was really superb. The only\r\nshadow on the picture was the Introducer of Ambassadors, who filled the\r\npart of master of the ceremonies. I never could make out why, for that\r\nvery theatrical part, we had chosen a hideously ugly man with no nose!\r\nWe ought to have had some fine handsome fellow to face those\r\nrepresentatives of all the nations in the world. When once the speeches\r\nhad been made, and the King and Queen had gone round the circle, the\r\ndiplomatic body retired backwards with the same three bows as on\r\nentering, and passed out very slowly, for at the time of which I speak\r\nit was exceedingly numerous. Besides the ambassadors of the Great\r\nPowers there were family ambassadors. And then there were ministers\r\nfrom every country in the world, including those of the small German\r\nand Italian States, which have now been swallowed up in German and\r\nItalian unity. All these embassies and legations had innumerable\r\nattaches, generally young men of great families attracted by the\r\ngaieties of Paris, and glad to have a uniform and the right of\r\nadmittance to all the entertainments at court, at the embassies, and in\r\nsociety in general. For in those days society did still exist, our\r\ndivisions and revolutionary laws having not yet succeeded in destroying\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOf all these diplomats, the most liked and the most likeable, beyond\r\nall contradiction, was the Austrian Ambassador, Count Apponyi, a\r\nmagnificent Hungarian magnate. The long duration of his mission, his\r\ntruly high-bred kindliness, and the salon which his wife, his winning\r\ndaughter, his sons, and nephews had been clever enough to make the\r\nfirst in Paris, had combined to render Count Apponyi most congenial to\r\nus. His English, Russian, and Prussian colleagues confined themselves\r\nexclusively to their official {{Illustration to the right of the text\r\nabove with no caption}} duties and to the coolest politeness. It would\r\nhave been hard for Lord Cowley (a Wellesley), even had he desired it,\r\nto wipe out the memory of his predecessors, Lords Granville and Stuart\r\nde Rothesay, and above all of the charming daughters of the last-named\r\npeer--beautiful, lovable, and artistic--who became Lady Waterford and\r\nLady Canning respectively. Among the ministers I still seem to see the\r\nform of Coletti, resplendent in his Greek costume--a true patriot and a\r\ndevoted friend to France--and then there was the Swedish Minister,\r\nComte de Loevenhielm, a charming old gentleman, who had been\r\npage-in-waiting on Gustavus III. the night he was murdered. The Spanish\r\nAmbassador changed with every pronunciamiento. I do not remember the\r\nname of any one of them.\r\n\r\nAs a novelty, we had a Turkish Ambassador. For centuries there had been\r\nnone but temporary Ottoman missions. The first permanently appointed\r\nambassador we had, before Namick and Reschid Pashas, who both spoke\r\nFrench very well, was Ahmed Fethi Pasha. He did not know a single word\r\nof our language. I was present at a great dinner in his honour at the\r\nTuileries, and this is what took place. Of course he had been placed on\r\nmy mother's right hand at table, with a Foreign Office interpreter, all\r\ngold lace and decorations, on his other side. As soon as dinner began,\r\nthe pasha conceived it incumbent on him to address my mother with a\r\nfine Turkish compliment, which, judging by the way he turned up his\r\neyes, and laid his hands on his heart, and the bows he made her, must\r\nhave been adorned with every flower of Oriental poetry. When his speech\r\nwas finished, the pasha turned to the interpreter for him to translate\r\nit to my mother, and this he proceeded to do, the pasha accompanying\r\nand accentuating his remarks with more bows and grimacing and pressure\r\nof his hands to his heart.\r\n\r\nNow, behold the translation, which the dragoman, who no doubt had\r\nperused the Bourgeois Gentilhomme, delivered to the Queen. \"Madam, I\r\nhave a daughter whom I am very anxious to get into the Maison de St.\r\nDenis. To do that I need your Majesty's powerful support. Your Majesty\r\nwill understand my seizing this unequalled chance of making my request.\"\r\n\r\nAnd all the time the good pasha kept on making agitated bows, and my\r\nmother had to keep on smiling at him and returning them!\r\n\r\nAs regards the condition of things in general, it appeared pacific\r\nenough in that year of grace 1842. The tempest in the East was almost\r\nforgotten, a breath of peace seemed to be passing over Europe, under\r\nthe influence of which calm and prosperity reigned in France. We had a\r\nmagnificent army, in which my brothers took as much interest as I did\r\nin the navy. And the head of the army was an eminent Minister of War,\r\nMarshal Soult, who, although he looked on M. Thiers as a tiresome\r\nlittle fidget, employed the fruits of his great experience and long\r\nservice in the Ministry in bringing every branch of our land forces to\r\nperfection gradually, and in the most admirably consistent spirit. This\r\narmy was waging an incessant war in Africa under a commander no less\r\neminent than the Marshal himself, General Bugeaud, thus carrying on the\r\nconquest of our splendid Algerian colony, which would have been\r\npeerless indeed if we could have filled it with that excess of\r\npopulation which other nations still possess, but which has been dried\r\nup, in our case, by our revolutionary laws. Our naval forces were in\r\ngood condition too, so far as they could be, on the eve of that great\r\nduel between sails and steam which was to end by revolutionising\r\neverything, in spite of all the delays of the red tape faction.\r\n\r\nOf politics, my pet aversion, I will not speak. I had sufficient\r\ncuriosity, before writing these lines, to look through the back numbers\r\nof the Moniteur for that period, and started in horror at the terrible\r\naccumulation of useless chatter I came upon. In contrast to these\r\ntorrents of fairly inoffensive eloquence, the unofficial press indulged\r\nin a large amount of intemperate writing, far more dangerous, seeing\r\nthat it flattered more passions, and that the calumnies thus spread\r\nwere much farther reaching. The Government, honest, useful, and\r\nenlightened as it was, consistently patriotic and far-seeing, was able\r\nas yet to thread its way amongst the obstacles cast in its path. Six\r\nmore years were to elapse before it was to be completely hemmed in, and\r\nthe deluded mob to dance wildly round the throne it had overturned\r\nsinging the democratic creed, the chorus of every revolution we have\r\nhad the last hundred years.\r\n\r\n Demolissons\r\n Tant que nous pourrons!\r\n Apres, nous verrons\r\n Ce que nous ferons.\r\n\r\nBut my winter in Paris slipped swiftly by, and towards the end of May\r\nAdmiral Hugon's squadron prepared to go to sea, the repairs to the\r\nBelle-Poule were finished, and I started to join my ship.\r\n\r\nAt Lyons I embarked on a steamer to go to Toulon, and this vessel\r\nbrought me to Arles under a lovely sunset. Nothing could be prettier\r\nthan the scene on arriving at this picture of an old town, with its\r\ntall towers and the great walls of its amphitheatre, its stone houses\r\nset in the Rhone, and its port full of boats with long graceful lateen\r\nyards. It was Sunday, besides, and the promenade was crowded with\r\npretty women. I am very fond of the little town, and am always glad to\r\nget back to it. So I lost no time about jumping on shore, and making\r\nover my baggage to the porter from the Hotel du Forum, I took advantage\r\nof the long twilight to see what changes three years had wrought in my\r\nold acquaintance. The women of Arles, a Greek colony, still preserve\r\nthe type of countenance so much admired by the ancients, undeteriorated\r\nby their slight admixture of Catalonian blood. The magnificent\r\nmonuments of the Roman city, the theatre and the arena, show the rank\r\nit held in ancient Gaul. In the present day it is a well-to-do, gay,\r\ncareless town, with a lively and frivolous population, fond of\r\npleasure, and indulging freely in it. Night overtook me during my walk,\r\nand under the splendid moonlight I could have fancied myself in some\r\nArab town; I was in a labyrinth of lanes, where the heat of day still\r\nhung. The women sat before the doors in their pretty Sunday dresses,\r\nchattering with the young men, and no carriage nor any sound disturbed\r\ntheir low talk in that harmonious tongue on which the poems of the\r\ntrouveres have shed such glory. It was exquisite. What a beautiful,\r\nnay, what an adorable country is France in all her varied aspects, east\r\nand west, north and south! What endless enchantments they afford, if\r\nonly one can get rid of the sickening politics that break up and\r\ndestroy everything they touch!\r\n\r\nOn the morrow I travelled down the Rhone, through the Camargue, with\r\nits droves of oxen and its flights of flamingos, lost in dreamy reverie\r\nas though foreseeing even then that beautiful poem of \"Mireille,\" which\r\nMistral and Gounod have since rendered immortal.\r\n\r\nWe sailed from Toulon, a splendid squadron, twenty strong, to manoeuvre\r\nat sea. We were under the orders of Admiral Hugon, \"Le Pere la Chique,\"\r\nas the men called him. The soubriquet bears its own explanation with\r\nit. Born at Granville and thoroughly Norman in character, the admiral\r\nconcealed the most unshakable determination under an appearance of the\r\ngreatest good-nature. I never met a more thorough-born sailor. He\r\ndivined what weather was coming, foretold it long before the barometer\r\ndid, and took all the necessary precautions in advance. He was the very\r\npersonification of the seafaring instinct. Besides this, he had a long\r\nrecord of bravery behind him. At Navarino, where he commanded the\r\nArmide, he came up and lay with true fraternal chivalry between the\r\nTurkish ships and a British frigate that was suffering very much from\r\ntheir fire, which same service the British corvette Rose rendered him\r\nin return, and with equal gallantry, towards the close of the\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of all this was that we all felt ourselves well led,\r\nand had the most absolute confidence in our chief, and I myself was\r\nparticularly fond of him. It really was a fine sight both from the\r\npicturesque point of view and from that of a justifiable national\r\npride, when our twenty white-sailed ships manoeuvred all together,\r\nunder the admiral's signal, on the blue Mediterranean waters, with no\r\nsound to break the silence except the shrill voices of the officers of\r\nthe watch.\r\n\r\nWe went on in this fashion, sailing and manoeuvring and firing our\r\nguns, and gauging day by day the respective values alike of officers\r\nand men, till we got to the Gulf of Naples, where we cast anchor, so as\r\nto give everybody a spell of rest and recreation. Very complete the\r\nrecreation was, every class of the population joining to give us the\r\nkindliest of welcomes. We sent our crews ashore, and there the\r\nFrenchman's gaiety soon went into partnership with the Neapolitan's.\r\nEverywhere corricoli were to be seen galloping along carrying clusters\r\nof merry sailors. Our ambassador, the Duc de Montebello, who kept great\r\nstate and the most open house at the Rothschild palace, introduced our\r\nofficers into the most delightful society of Naples, and there was a\r\nsuccession of parties and merry-makings. By way of response, the\r\nadmiral gave a very pretty afternoon party on board his three-decker,\r\nthe Ocean, and I a ball on board the Belle-Poule. I had found a goodly\r\nnumber of old acquaintances, besides my cousins of both sexes, and\r\nespecially I frequented the society of a certain charming Tertullia,\r\nwho held her daily court at the Palazzo Fernandina, a place of meeting\r\nwhich all of my generation at Naples must recollect. It was a Spanish\r\nhouse, belonging to the Toledo family, numerous branches of which were\r\nrepresented in it, such as the Villafranca, the Alcanicez, the Bivona,\r\nthe Sclafani, &c. What charming women of every nationality one met\r\nthere! What pleasant parties we organised thence, with Isabella\r\nColonna, Teresa Sclafani, and that exquisite creature Lauretta Acton,\r\nwho afterwards became Madame Minghetti, and many another! Now it would\r\nbe a night ascent of Vesuvius, in eruption, and then again a moonlight\r\nexcavation at Pompeii. Show me the man who would not have fallen in\r\nlove in such company, beneath that exquisite sky, environed and\r\nintoxicated by the indefinable enchantments in which the landscape and\r\nthe very air you breathed were steeped! But the signal to get under way\r\nis hoisted at the mainmast of the Ocean, and we must tear ourselves\r\naway from these delights, and start forth with hearts that are heavy,\r\nbut full of sweetest memories. And whither? That is the Admiral's\r\nsecret!\r\n\r\nA few days after our departure we were in the open sea, absorbed in\r\nprofessional duties and daily drills, when afar off we saw the smoke of\r\na steamer. Soon the vessel came in sight and hoisted signals for our\r\nadmiral, who ordered the fleet to bring to. The sea being calm, an\r\nofficer from the steamer boarded the Ocean, and immediately afterwards\r\nwe saw the admiral's barge lowered, and he got into it and steered for\r\nthe Belle-Poule. Amid the general astonishment and numerous conjectures\r\ncaused by this unusual incident, I received my chief at the\r\ncompanion-ladder. He grasped my hand, squeezed it tight, drew me into\r\nthe cabin, and said, \"Your brother, the Duc d'Orleans, is dead, killed\r\nin a carriage accident. My orders are to send you to Paris at once.\"\r\nThe rough old sailor's face betrayed his deep emotion. But how shall I\r\ndescribe my own, under such a terrible and unexpected blow? This\r\nworld's sorest sorrows are those that tear the human heart-strings, and\r\nmine was even more bitter than an ordinary grief, for I do not believe\r\nthere ever was a more attached family than ours, and not only had I\r\nlost the most beloved of brothers, but the confidant, the guide and the\r\ncompanion of my whole life. I seemed to see and feel the despair of my\r\nfather, above all of my mother, and of my brothers and sisters, too,\r\nunder this awful blow, and their sorrow added to my own. For a moment I\r\nstood thunderstruck. Then the admiral left me alone .... I gave over my\r\nship to my second in command, and within an hour I was on my way to\r\nToulon, the gloomy faces round me betraying the general feeling that\r\nthis was a public misfortune, and that the loss to France was very\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed immense, irreparable. For the past ten years we all, and\r\nwith us the whole of France, had looked to my brother as our leader,\r\nthe \"chef de demain,\" our chief in the great days that were to come. We\r\nhad of course the tenderest affection, the most entire devotion, the\r\ndeepest respect for the King, Le Pere, as we always called him amongst\r\nourselves, but it was to Chartres we turned for guidance always. There\r\nwas not one of us who would not from childhood upwards have\r\nunhesitatingly accepted his advice and his authority. How often had we\r\ndiscussed with him all the chances the future might bring! How often,\r\ntoo, had he pointed out the various parts he destined each of us to\r\nplay, every one of them, we felt, stamped with the good sense and\r\nprofound understanding of a born leader of men! And what we, his\r\nbrothers, his lieutenants, so to speak, felt about him, the country\r\nfelt as well. The King was in the breach, valiantly carrying on the\r\nbattle of life, to preserve the peace, calm, and prosperity she was\r\nenjoying to France, and all those who were not blinded by democratic\r\nenvy were grateful to him for so doing. But he was growing old, great\r\ncomplications might arise, and, like us, all had looked confidently to\r\nthe young leader who, without ever mixing himself up in the barren\r\nstruggles of everyday politics, was ceaselessly preparing himself for\r\ngreat and important contingencies. For every one else, as well as for\r\nus, I repeat, the Duc d'Orleans was the chef de demain. His incessant\r\ncare for the good organisation and perfecting of our military forces,\r\nand the pains he took to select the most deserving men from their ranks\r\nwithout a shadow of favouritism or regard for birth--such men as\r\nLamoriciere, Cavaignac, Canrobert, and MacMahon--and to advance them to\r\nthe highest positions, had been appreciated by the public. All this was\r\npour demain, for the morrow. So too in matters civilian. If he did\r\nstretch out his hand, not indeed to incorrigible revolutionaries, but\r\nto men of advanced opinions, who were in opposition to the King's\r\nGovernment, that too was \"for the morrow.\" It was so as to be able, in\r\nthe hour of his country's peril, to serve as the patriotic link between\r\nall the living forces in the nation. The general feeling, alas! both\r\nour own and that of the great majority of thinking men, was that the\r\nbond that might have held these forces together against revolution,\r\noverflowing from within, as well as enemies attacking from without, had\r\njust been snapped. Death had destroyed the anticipated and universally\r\naccepted successor, and with him the chief prop of the July Monarchy.\r\nThenceforward the ship was to toss uncommanded, objectless and\r\ncompassless, at the mercy of every tempest. Men and principles alike\r\nhad failed us, and we were to relapse once more into a state of\r\nunstable government. This sad presentiment was only too well justified\r\nby ultimate events.\r\n\r\nPhysically, my eldest brother was tall, with a slight and exceptionally\r\nelegant figure. In uniform and on horseback he looked magnificent, and\r\nhis soldierly presence pleased the troops as much as it did the\r\npopulace. As for bravery, he was downright reckless, another cause for\r\npopularity with the masses. Everybody knew he had received a wound in\r\nAfrica, before Mascara, by throwing himself boldly among the\r\nskirmishers at a critical moment. It was known, too, that at the\r\nMouzaia Pass, when the whole army was wearing a cap covered with black\r\noilcloth, he alone insisted on wearing a bright red one, which marked\r\nhim out to all the men as their commanding officer, but which also\r\nexposed himself, and those near him as well, to the enemy's bullets. To\r\nthe charm of valour my brother added that of speech, that music of the\r\ntongue to which all men, but especially Frenchmen, are so sensitive.\r\nAnd to this he added another quality not less seductive, especially in\r\na prince--he was a good listener; listening, in fact, was one of his\r\nforemost qualities. Surrounded, as he always was, by eminent men of\r\nevery nationality, he would assimilate with extraordinary facility and\r\nwonderful retentiveness not only the fruitful ideas which he gleaned\r\nfrom their conversation, but the very words which struck his fancy. And\r\nthese words, as well as those with which his cultivated and thoroughly\r\nFrench mind and his heart inspired him, he knew how to use with\r\nmarvellous effect. What more eloquent than the toast he proposed at a\r\nfarewell banquet in the open air, at which his whole division, officers\r\nand men alike, were gathered round him, after their return from the\r\nexpedition to the Iron Gates?\r\n\r\n\"In the name of the King, who four times over has sent his son to serve\r\nin its ranks, I drink to the army of Africa and its general-in-chief,\r\nMarshal Vallee, under whose orders it has accomplished such great deeds.\r\n\r\n\"To the army which has conquered a vast and splendid empire for France,\r\nopening a boundless field to that civilisation of which it is the\r\nvanguard, and that colonisation of which it is the first pledge.\r\n\r\n\"To the army that has handled rifle and pick in turn, fighting Arabs or\r\nfever as they came, facing an inglorious death in hospital with stoic\r\nresignation, and which by its brilliant valour has preserved the most\r\nfamous traditions of our arms among our youthful soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"To the army, the flower of that greater French army--the nursery, on\r\nthe one battlefield reserved to us alone, of our future military\r\nchiefs--whose heart swells with a just and noble pride in those who\r\nhave already risen from its ranks.\r\n\r\n\"To the army, which, distant as it is from the fatherland, knows\r\nhappily nothing of the intestine conflicts waged there, except to curse\r\nthem, and which, being as it is the refuge of those who flee them, asks\r\nnothing but to fight nature, Arabs, and the climate, in the general\r\ninterest of France.\r\n\r\n\"And to the illustrious leader, the captor of Constantine, who has\r\nstamped French Africa with the indelible seal of permanent possession,\r\nand planted our flag where the Romans dared not carry their eagles.\"\r\n\r\nThe reception given by the soldiers, whose toils and dangers he had\r\njust been sharing, to this vigorous language may be imagined. He had\r\nthe supreme charm, both for soldiers and for artists, who always found\r\na friend and protector in him, and for women as well. But here I touch\r\na delicate subject, and the most inviolable secrecy checks my pen. Old\r\nBaron James de Rothschild was heard to say in his old age that he yet\r\nhad to meet the lady who could resist him. I fancy he boasted somewhat.\r\nI fancy, too, that if he had not met her then, he ended by knowing such\r\na lady. But I am certain, without going so far as the baron did, that\r\nmy brother met few women, in the course of his radiant youth, who did\r\nnot respond to his homage, at all events with a secret but tender\r\nemotion. Into what adventures that personal charm of his carried him!\r\nHe was saved on one such occasion, from a very risky situation, by his\r\nown sangfroid and boldness. It was at a period when attempted risings\r\nwere continually occurring in Paris. Either HE or SHE had had the\r\nsomewhat original idea of meeting at a house in a far from poetic\r\nstreet which still exists--the Rue Tiquetonne. Presently alarming\r\nsounds were heard, and then died away, only to begin again, louder than\r\never. Soon the distant rolling of drums sounded, followed by rifle\r\nshots. It was the situation in the fourth act of The Huguenots. They\r\nrushed to the window. The street was full of armed rioters, busily\r\nengaged in building up barricades. How was he, the Prince Royal, known\r\nas he was by everybody, to get away? \"I turned up the collar of my\r\novercoat,\" he told me, \"and I was lucky enough to get into the street\r\njust as they were dragging up a carriage to upset it and make it the\r\nnucleus of the barricade. I caught hold of it at once, helped to turn\r\nit over, and to pile paving-stones and stuff of all sorts over and\r\nround it, with an amount of zeal that disarmed all suspicion. And then\r\nI watched my opportunity and slipped away.\" In an hour he was in\r\nuniform and on horseback, and the Municipal Guard was carrying HIS\r\nbarricade at the bayonet's point. [Footnote: Translator's note.--What\r\nbecame of the poor lady?]\r\n\r\nSuch, under his various aspects, was the brother I had lost.\r\n\r\nI reached Neuilly in time to be present at his solemn funeral, which\r\ntook place at Notre-Dame amid the most touching proofs of the general\r\nsorrow. We took him to the mausoleum at Dreux, and then we shut\r\nourselves up at Neuilly to cling to each other and mourn him in silence\r\nand retirement.\r\n\r\nBut though my brother Nemours, upon whom the eventual duties of Regent\r\nfell by the Duc d'Orleans' death, was by that fact prevented from going\r\naway, neither I nor my other brothers, who wore the King's uniform,\r\nwere able to remain long in idleness.\r\n\r\nAumale was appointed to the command of the Province of Tittery, in\r\nAlgiers. The Belle-Poule was ordered on a cruise along the Guinea Coast\r\nand to South America, touching first of all at Lisbon, and it was\r\nsettled that Aumale should take passage on board her as far as that\r\nport. So after a sad farewell we started together to join her at Brest.\r\nAs our mourning exempted us from all official receptions, we took the\r\nlongest way round, by the Loire Valley, with its ancient castles, the\r\nwild country of Morbihan, and the picturesque scenery of Finistere. Our\r\nfirst stage was to Blois, where we went to see the castle, an historic\r\ngem, then on to Amboise, Saumur, Angers, Pont-de-Ce, and Nantes.\r\nEverything about that journey--scenery, monuments, memories,\r\nlegends--is delightful. It is a touching unfolding of the history of\r\nold France--that France of bygone days, which, with her faded glories\r\nand her chivalrous adventures, consoles those who love her for the\r\ncalamities born of revolution. We made a short stay at Nantes, whence\r\nAumale went to Chateaubriand to look at his property with M. de la\r\nHaye-Jousselin, while I went to Karheil to see the chateau of the\r\nCoislin family. This was for sale, and my father was anxious to buy it\r\nas a centre to the sandy tracts of Saint Gildas and Lanvaux, which he\r\nowned already, and which previous to the year 1830, he had planted with\r\ntrees, which had done well.\r\n\r\nOn my way to Karheil I passed through Blain, where I saw the ruins of\r\nthe famous castle of the Rohans, the cradle of that mighty race. Only\r\ntwo out of the nine towers adorning it are still standing. The rest\r\nwere pulled down during the Revolution. The heart tightens at the sight\r\nof these ruins scattered in all directions and the inevitable\r\nrepetition of the phrase, \"Destroyed during the Revolution.\" The\r\nSaracens and Huns did no worse things.\r\n\r\nIn the company of an aged man with powdered wig and side curls, the\r\npicture of an old-fashioned henchman, and armed with full powers from\r\nthe Coislin as well as from the Rohan family, I went to see Karheil, a\r\ncastle perched on a rock, encircled by a pretty stream. The glades of\r\nthe fine park were obstructed by fences, hedges, and ditches, and other\r\nartificial obstacles, which turned them into a steeplechase course--an\r\narrangement, so M. Bizeul told me, of M. le Marquis \"for the amusement\r\nof the people coming to the chateau.\" Then he looked at me. I know not\r\nwhat he read in my eyes, but a paroxysm of grief seized him, and he was\r\nalmost in tears as he confided to me the sorrow he felt at seeing one\r\nof the oldest and most venerated families in Brittany go down the hill.\r\nAnd the old friend of the family had good reason to be grieved. There\r\nwas good stuff in the Marquis de Coislin of that date. As a young man\r\nhe had put himself at the head of his devoted partisans, like a gallant\r\nknight, in the Duchesse de Berry's insurrection. Later on, I had met\r\nhim in Paris, a splendid gentleman, whose deep glance breathed passion,\r\nand no doubt inspired it too. Many years later yet, in 1871, those who\r\nsaw Charette's Zouaves fighting with the army of the Loire noticed in\r\ntheir ranks a tall old white-bearded man, a simple Zouave indeed, but\r\nan exemplar of courage and devotion. That was the Marquis de Coislin.\r\nSad it is that it is through our revolutions and divisions the services\r\nof such men should be lost to France.\r\n\r\nFrom Nantes too I went to see the naval workshops at Indret, where I\r\nwas received by exceedingly capable and intelligent chiefs of\r\ndepartments, and where I saw a body of artificers quite out of the\r\ncommon, but all of them misplaced in a badly situated establishment,\r\nthe original plan of which was utterly defective, and in which they\r\nwere forced to vegetate uselessly in spite of their own impotent\r\nefforts and endeavours. Thence we took our way across the Morbihan to\r\nVannes, which during the whole of my father's reign was administered by\r\nthe same prefect, and that with the esteem of every party. An\r\nexceptional case this (especially when the state of latent civil war in\r\nwhich the department was, is considered), and one much to the credit of\r\nthe gentleman in question, M. Lorois. Our journey was so hurried that\r\nwe had barely time to kneel at the shrine of St. Anne d'Auray, so\r\nhighly venerated by Breton pilgrims, and to give some hasty alms to the\r\ncrowd of beggars clustered on the steps of the sanctuary. They all\r\nlimped off at once, with a great clatter of crutches and wooden shoes,\r\nto fetch us water from the Bonne-Mere to wash our faces and eyes with.\r\nThe journey across Brittany from Nantes to Brest, by Auray, Rosporden,\r\nand Quimper, is a delightful one. Smiling and picturesque scenery\r\neverywhere, old churches too, surrounded by fine trees, and at the\r\nperiod of which I speak, 1842, the quaintest of costumes as well. Here\r\nwithy-cutters, or salt-marsh workers from Guerande, in blouses,\r\nbreeches, and long white gaiters, with broad-brimmed hats laden with\r\ncharms on their flowing hair. There people from St. Pol-de-Leon, all in\r\nblack. Further on, a group of women, in embroidered bodices and quaint\r\nheaddresses, kneeling on the open heath, at the foot of a stone cross.\r\nHow pretty those little Breton women are with their well-shaped waists\r\nand their short petticoats, showing glimpses of neat blue stockinged\r\nlegs, and fresh rosy faces under their white caps! Those eyes of theirs\r\nare cast down devoutly at their prayers, but on feast days they are\r\nraised and shine with passionate fire. On such occasions, if we may\r\nbelieve report, the pretty little devotees follow the guidance of that\r\neleventh commandment, which, according to the late Lord Clarendon, sums\r\nup all the rest:\r\n\r\n D'etre pince te garderas,\r\n Afin de fauter librement--\r\n\r\nor, in the English version, \"Thou shalt not be found out.\"\r\n\r\nWe reached Lisbon after a swift passage. The Tagus is a fine river,\r\ncertainly, but, to my mind, the much vaunted panorama of Lisbon does\r\nnot merit its reputation. The Tower of Belem alone, with its curious\r\narchitecture, enchants the eye, and the enchantment is prolonged, on\r\nlanding, by the sight of the exquisite church standing behind it. But\r\nthere it ends. All the rest is ugliness. We went ashore in the royal\r\nlaunch (Falua), a vessel adorned with gilt carvings, and with a silken\r\nawning over her stern. The crew were men from Algarve, with tanned\r\nskins, dressed in short drawers and jackets of amaranth-coloured\r\nvelvet, with Venetian caps on their heads. They stood upright to row,\r\nkeeping their strokes in time to a sort of litany in the Queen's\r\nhonour, which they sang in chorus.\r\n\r\nThis was not my first visit to Lisbon. I was rejoiced to see the Queen\r\nDona Maria again. She was one of my childhood's friends, and I was\r\neventually to become her brother-in-law I know not how many times over.\r\nI also renewed my acquaintance with King Ferdinand, of whom I had not\r\nseen so much. The King, who was an artist to his finger tips, a\r\ndistinguished musician, water-colour artist, etcher, and ceramist,\r\nhated politics. This and some other little failings common to us both,\r\ndrew us together, and our friendship endured up to his premature death.\r\nI have often been in Portugal since those days, and have always\r\nreceived a welcome for which I feel the liveliest gratitude. I have met\r\ndistinguished men there, and charming, well-informed, and kind-hearted\r\nladies. I have vowed the sincerest affection alike to both Portugal and\r\nthe Portuguese, and my best wishes follow both country and people all\r\nover the world, but I will not commit myself to any opinion as to their\r\npolitical life.\r\n\r\nAt the time I speak of, the country possessed two illustrious soldiers,\r\nMarshal Saldanha and Marshal Terceira. On these two, in turn, hinged\r\nthe alternate changes made in its constitution, whether by military\r\ninsurrection, or other and less unparliamentary means. Such was the\r\nnational habit, and the country did not seem the worse for it. As in\r\nour own case, there were two dynastic parties, but what was strange was\r\nthat the Miguelists, who opposed Queen Dona Maria, and who, by the way,\r\nwere few in numbers, set up for being Legitimists, although they\r\nclaimed the right of government for Don Miguel, the representative of\r\nthe younger branch of the reigning family. Let wise politicians explain\r\nthat as best they may.\r\n\r\nI do not recollect whether it was on the occasion of this particular\r\nvisit to Lisbon, that at a reception of mine for the diplomatic body at\r\nBelem, the Duke de Palmela, who presented its members (as Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs), asked me to excuse his hurrying through the ceremony,\r\nas his Duchess was in the act of bringing her fifteenth child into the\r\nworld. A palpable proof this, given by the head of its Foreign Office,\r\nof the vitality of the Portuguese nation! Some days later the Duke, a\r\ndiplomatist of the old school, who added to his own considerable wit\r\nand cleverness the advantage of having rubbed shoulders with the\r\ngreatest diplomatists of the century, such as Talleyrand and\r\nMetternich, asked me to dine with him. It was a splendid banquet. On\r\nour arrival we found the royal archers (so called because they carried\r\nhalberts!) lining the staircase. Thence we passed into a splendid suite\r\nof rooms, at the end of which, after we left table, a great door was\r\nthrown open, revealing a magnificent state bed on an estrade with\r\nseveral steps up to it. And in this bed the newly confined Duchess, to\r\nwhom all the guests hastened to pay their duty!\r\n\r\nI noticed some fine rifle battalions at a review of the Portuguese\r\ntroops, and I had a very amusing talk with the celebrated admiral, Sir\r\nCharles Napier, who was present on horseback, in a British\r\npost-captain's uniform, but with a little hat, a la Napoleon, with a\r\nPortuguese cockade, his trousers all worked up, huge spurs on his feet,\r\nand an enormous cudgel in his grasp.\r\n\r\nFinally, the King took us on a sporting expedition to Mafra, among the\r\nmountains which stretch towards Torres Vedras. They are not high, but\r\nsteep, and covered with stunted vegetation. It was a picturesque sight\r\nthis shooting party, in that mountain country, some of it very\r\nbeautiful, where the eye constantly lighted on scenes that were like\r\npictures of guerilla or partisan warfare. Hundreds of beaters, in their\r\nbrilliant costumes, wearing breeches, and with handkerchiefs tied round\r\ntheir heads, and cloaks flung over their shoulders, climbed up through\r\nthe gorges, slipped swiftly along the mountain ledges, and drove a host\r\nof small deer, stags, wild boar, and foxes down to the sportsmen. Even\r\nafter the sun had set the firing was still going on.\r\n\r\nBut both Aumale and I were very eager to see something more of Portugal\r\nthan the pleasures and official and political life of Lisbon. So as\r\nsoon as we were back from the shooting excursion we started on a\r\nwhimsical expedition of our own, which we hoped to carry as far as the\r\nancient and celebrated university town of Coimbra. All means of\r\ncommunication being most primitive at that time, we travelled on\r\nhorseback, escorted by a former captain on the French staff, who had\r\nbeen aide-de-camp to the Duke of Ragusa in 1830, who had succeeded his\r\nuncle, Hyde de Neuville, as Marquis of Bemposta in Portugal, and who\r\nhad ended by becoming aide-de-camp to King Ferdinand. We formed a\r\nregular caravan, the transport service of which had been undertaken by\r\na native \"Almocreve.\"\r\n\r\nThe first day we crossed a sort of desert country, of evil repute,\r\ncovered with heather as far as the eye could see--the lowest spurs of\r\nthe Sierra d'Estrella, a long mountain chain which rises in Spain, near\r\nSegovia and Avila. Passing through a wild gorge, at a place called\r\nMecheira, we came upon a band of evil-looking men, gun on shoulder, who\r\nseemed to be out shooting in an easy-going fashion. Our party was both\r\nwell-armed and numerous, and I fancy they looked on it as too heavy\r\ngame for their rifles. I am all the more inclined to this opinion,\r\nbecause we met some cavalry patrols a little further on, who had been\r\nsent out in a great hurry, some travellers having been stopped and\r\nstripped at Mecheira that very morning. Two days' travelling brought us\r\nto Alcobaca and Aljubarota. My reader will notice these names beginning\r\nwith Al. The Moors have passed this way! Aljubarota is famous for the\r\nbattle there, which established the autonomy of the kingdom of Portugal\r\nin 1385. The army commanded by the Grand Master of Avis, Don Jao, had\r\nto do with a Spanish force using firearms (the \"needle-gun\" of that\r\ndate!), which were quite unknown to the Portuguese troops. These last\r\nhad both wind and sun and dust against them. But buoyed up by their\r\nnative bravery, and by the example of Don Jao, and of the Bishop of\r\nBraga, who rode down the ranks with helmet on head and lance in hand,\r\nthey put the Spanish army to flight, and the Spanish King never stopped\r\ntill he got to Seville. As for the Grand Master of Avis, who became\r\nKing of Portugal, he founded the church and convent of Batalha, which\r\nwe had come to see, in memory of his victory.\r\n\r\nI know not how to describe ancient buildings. I am no architect; but\r\nthings which are stately always strike me deeply; and there is no doubt\r\nabout it, Batalha is stately, simple, severe, with that religious stamp\r\nabout it which I look for vainly in the churches of our own day. The\r\ndoorway, delicately carved, and in beautiful preservation, represents\r\nterrestrial paradise, and every one of the statues of the saints is a\r\nlittle masterpiece. Behind the church there is a chapel begun by Don\r\nEmmanuel, and which he was never able to finish. This is much to be\r\nregretted, to judge by what already exists. There is some sculpture of\r\nthe most extraordinary delicacy--almost like a spider's web. But, alas!\r\nvandals have come upon the scene. The stained glass has gone, and ever\r\nso many statuettes are missing from their niches, sold to collectors or\r\nto passing tourists. Close to the church stands the convent, similar in\r\nstyle to the convent at Belem. There is one huge Gothic hall, which I\r\nthought superb. The story goes that the vaulted ceiling gave way three\r\ntimes, and that when it had been built up again the fourth time the\r\narchitect stood himself underneath it just as the last scaffolding was\r\nknocked away. The vault stood, and he had his own face carved on one of\r\nthe pendentives, thus forming a statuette which is by no means one of\r\nthe least beautiful in that splendid building, all the more to be\r\nadmired, to my thinking, on account of its being absolutely untouched\r\nby the barbarous hand of the restorer.\r\n\r\nWe went on to Leiria, where a great market gave us an opportunity of\r\nadmiring the beauty of the country women and their charming costumes.\r\nWe put up in a posada, in which the stable was on the first floor and\r\nthe kitchen on the second, and where we shared rooms with geese and\r\npigs and a party of travelling gelders from France. After Leiria came\r\nPombal. These little Portuguese towns are all charming. They seem as if\r\nthey belonged to another period altogether. The pillory is still to be\r\nseen in them, and the gaol too; this last a sort of wild beast cage,\r\nwith a huge grated window level with the public square, through which\r\nevery one can talk, without any surveillance, with the prisoners,\r\ncondemned or otherwise, who are all huddled together pell mell. There\r\nwere only two young women in the gaol at Pombal. We entered into\r\nconversation with them. By dint of questioning them, and the passers-by\r\nas well, we learnt that they were sisters--and then came the eternal\r\nold tale. The eldest had a lover, and all the rest of it! She had not\r\ncourage to put the child out of the way, and her young sister buried it\r\nalive. The unhappy girls had been five months in that cage waiting\r\ntheir sentence, exposed to all the insults, jests, and coarse remarks\r\nof the populace. What torture to those poor women, who, to judge by\r\ntheir features and appearance, were evidently of a superior class to\r\nthe mere peasants! The elder one, the mother, was very beautiful,\r\nthough pale and seemingly weakened by suffering. Her expression was so\r\ngentle it pained me to look at her. \"Ah, let no man insult a woman who\r\nhas fallen,\" says the poet.\r\n\r\nAfter the pillory and the gaol we had another memory of the Middle\r\nAges. Shortly before we got to Coimbra we met one of the great local\r\nfamilies, the Pinto-Bastos, travelling along the road, the ladies in\r\nlitters, each borne by two gaily-caparisoned mules, the gentlemen on\r\nhorseback, in the costume of the country, and escorted by numerous\r\nserving-men, also mounted, and wearing big caps, breeches, and handsome\r\nvelvet jackets with silver buttons. Each man carried his striped\r\nwrapper over his shoulder, and was armed with the huge stick the\r\nPortuguese know how to wield so well. The whole caravan made a fine\r\neffect. Looking at it pass by, you might fancy yourself in the\r\nsixteenth century. All at once, from the crest of some rising ground,\r\nwe caught sight of the beautiful and smiling Mondego Valley, with\r\nCoimbra rising in terraces along the river against a fine mountain\r\nbackground. It was most picturesque. We descended towards a long stone\r\nbridge leading to the town, and each members of our caravan made\r\nhimself ready as best he could to give the least handle possible to the\r\njests with which the students habitually salute all newly-arrived\r\nstrangers. The whole corporation was under arms, indeed, in the sable\r\ncostume, doublet, breeches and cloak, with which the \"Estudiantinas\r\nEspagnoles\" have familiarised us, only in this case the Spanish cocked\r\nhat and spoon was replaced by a sort of black Phrygian cap. To our\r\nastonishment, these young gentlemen, instead of poking fun at us, got\r\noff the parapet on which they had been sitting, pulled off their caps\r\nto us, and welcomed us with the most kindly politeness. They knew,\r\nperhaps, that we too had worn our breeches out upon school benches, and\r\nthus saluted us as comrades!\r\n\r\nBeyond this friendly row of men in black, we saw the river dotted with\r\nwhite sails, and on its banks, among the willows, we beheld not a few\r\nof those well-shaped washer-women with turned-up skirts, whom Camoens\r\nchristened the nymphs of the Mondego. At the far end of the bridge,\r\nbetween tall irregular walls, stood a gateway as dark as the entrance\r\nto a Turkish town; and just as we would have passed through it,\r\nmournful objurgations and sorrowful appeals from some invisible mortals\r\nrose around us, while baskets hanging on pulleys came down upon our\r\nheads, and porringers fastened to long reeds started out of holes in\r\nthe walls and terrified our horses. The prisoners shut up within those\r\nwalls were thus beseeching us to deposit our alms, pecuniary or other,\r\nin their baskets or their porringers! Having dismounted at a good inn,\r\nwe discovered that the \"Mesonero\" (in other words, our host) was the\r\npossessor of two pretty daughters, whom he kept in a tower under lock\r\nand key, so dangerous a town is Coimbra! But we set our wits to work to\r\ncatch a sight of the beautiful recluses. By means of a nosegay tied to\r\nthe end of a long stick we drew two sprightly faces, well worthy their\r\nreputation, to the window, and so we made acquaintance. Then we were\r\nfetched to go over the university, the honours of which were done us by\r\nthe \"grand master\" in a blue and gold gown, assisted by two professors\r\nwho spoke French admirably well. Aumale, being much more lettered and\r\nacademic than myself, kept the conversational ball rolling brilliantly.\r\nThe huge institution, in which professors and students alike seemed to\r\nme to know their work thoroughly, is admirably organised, and is\r\nvenerated throughout the whole country on account of its great\r\nantiquity. To the Portuguese mind it is the fountain-head of all\r\nknowledge; and we were told, in the most artless manner, that if our\r\nuniversities in France were good it was because they were managed by\r\nprofessors from Coimbra! From the university we went on to see an\r\nancient mosque which had been turned into a cathedral, but which still\r\npreserved its thoroughly Moorish character. In Spain and Portugal alike\r\nthe Moors have left indelible traces of their passage, both in the\r\nbuildings, in the language, and in the types of the two races. Our stay\r\nat Coimbra ended with an expedition to the \"Quinta das Lagrimas\" (the\r\nVilla of Tears). In the shadow of the gigantic cedars which shelter\r\nthis villa, standing in a lovely spot on the banks of the Mondego, the\r\nromantic story of the loves of the Infant of Portugal, Don Pedro, and\r\nof Inez de Castro, as sung by Camoens, and ending in that murder of\r\nInez, to the punishment of which the whole life of Don Pedro \"the\r\nAvenger\" was devoted, unfolded itself. The proprietors for the time\r\nbeing of the villa gave me some of Inez de Castro's hair, which they\r\nhad collected when her tomb was violated during the Napoleonic wars. It\r\nis fair hair.\r\n\r\nWe returned to Lisbon by a different route, over terrible roads,\r\nscarcely more than tracks, across a land of moors and pine-woods,\r\npicturesque enough, but wild and lonely, where we came in broad\r\ndaylight on huge wolves, prowling round the flocks of goats, which the\r\ngoatherds still call, as in the most primitive times, by blowing on\r\nconch shells. Two days' march brought us within sight of the little\r\ntown of Thomar, and at nightfall we reached our halting place--a\r\nhorrible \"hospedaria,\" in the kitchen of which we took refuge, chilled,\r\nand aching with fatigue. Aumale dandled the children in the\r\nchimney-corner, thereby winning their fond affections, while I set to\r\nwork to make love to the mistress of the establishment, a stout and not\r\naltogether illiterate lady--for she could swear in any language.\r\n\r\nThomar! Were you ever at Thomar? Did you ever even hear of it? Yet how\r\nmany a journey has been made, how much trouble has been taken, to see\r\nwhat is much less worth seeing! The object of my admiration there is a\r\nconvent, sacked, alas! and plundered--well-nigh utterly destroyed, but\r\nstill the most singularly remarkable building conceivable. The nucleus\r\nof the convent is formed by a round mosque, with coloured pillars, and\r\na \"mirhab,\" which I still see in my mind's eye, full of long-robed and\r\nturbaned Mussulmans, plunged in solemn meditation. With the Christian\r\nconquest, the mosque became a Christian church, and the mirhab in its\r\ncentre the high altar. After the Moors came the Templars, and then the\r\nKnights of Christ, who bravely defended the convent against an\r\nattempted Moorish recapture. A gate is still shown, called the \"Gate of\r\nblood\" on account of the carnage of which it was the scene. The\r\nTemplars and the Knights of Christ have both left their mark upon the\r\nedifice. Later in the day came Don Emmanuel, and with him the rich and\r\nquaint style of his period. A choir and a wonderful doorway were added\r\nto the old mosque, the cloisters were lengthened, and beautiful halls\r\nwere erected. Then the Spanish Philips, during their suzerainty over\r\nPortugal, made Thomar their residence, and in the new cloisters they\r\nadded to the edifice, the severe and heavy style of architecture which\r\nthe gloomy character of Philip II. brought into fashion is exemplified.\r\nThe convent is at once an architectural and historical museum, and the\r\nmost striking of religious monuments. The silence of the immense\r\ncloisters--there are six or seven of them--is deeply impressive. I\r\ncould not tear myself away, every moment seemed to reveal some new and\r\nstriking detail. I was roused from my admiration and my reverie by a\r\nvolunteer guide who had attached himself to me, and who, seeing me\r\npause before an exquisite statuette, said, \"I'll take it down for you\r\nto carry away with you,\" adding, when I exclaimed in horror at the idea\r\n\"But everybody takes what they like here!\" I am happy to be able to add\r\nthat we denounced this vandalism as soon as we got back to Lisbon, at\r\nthe same time so exciting King Ferdinand's truly artistic feelings by\r\nour description of Thomar that he went there in his turn, and, thanks\r\nto him, the preservation of that unique edifice was thenceforth assured.\r\n\r\nWe made a delightful journey from Thomar to Lisbon, by Abrantes, at\r\nwhich place I saw an old gentleman in an antediluvian uniform, wearing\r\nhis sword transversely like a powdered marquis in a play, advance\r\ntowards me, and throw himself on his knees, embracing mine, and\r\nexclaiming, \"Let me embrace the man who brought back Napoleon!\" (Le\r\nconducteur de Napoleon), an allusion to my St. Helena expedition, which\r\nsomewhat amazed me. When we got back to Lisbon I bade a sorrowful\r\nfarewell to Aumale, who departed on board a steamship for Algiers,\r\nthere to commence the brilliant campaign which ended in the capture of\r\nAbd-el-Kader's smalah. Horace Vernet's fine picture in the Versailles\r\nMuseum perpetuates the memory of this splendid exploit.\r\n\r\nMy readers are aware that having started to capture the smalah, my\r\nbrother got up to it with nothing but his cavalry and far from his\r\nsupports, after several night marches, which he contrived to steal on\r\nthe enemy. \"The enemy is very strong,\" said Colonel Yusuf, a gallant\r\nofficer, who was with the advance guard, hurrying back. \"No prince of\r\nmy race has ever turned back,\" was the answer. \"Forward!\" and the\r\nlittle force, with the general at its head, threw itself unhesitatingly\r\non the mass of warriors in front. Its audacity was justified by its\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nAs for me, while Aumale was steaming towards Algeria I was bidding\r\nfarewell to my excellent friends and relatives, Queen Dona Maria and\r\nKing Ferdinand, and setting sail for Senegal and the Guinea Coast,\r\nwhere I was to make the round of our colonial settlements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n1843\r\n\r\n\r\nThe canoe manned by four paddlers in which I had crossed the bar at\r\nGuet-n-dar was carried high up on the sand on the crest of a huge wave.\r\nA crowd of blacks rushed forward before the wave could come back,\r\nlifted me out, and put me down, with loud shouts of \"Petit roi pas\r\ngoutte d'eau\" (Not a drop of water on our little king), at the feet of\r\nBobokar, King of Guet-n-dar, a tall negro, dressed in a striped cotton\r\ngown, and with a laced cocked hat on his head, which had seen better\r\ndays on a general officer's or a coachman's.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I was landed, the King of Guet-n-dar (I only call him king\r\nin obedience to the African custom which bestows the title on every\r\nchief who has a right to beat other people)--the King, I say, set\r\nhimself to work to make way for me through his subjects crowding round,\r\nwith heavy blows from his cudgel, and crossing the tongue of sand\r\nbetween the Senegal river and the sea, which forms his kingdom, I\r\nentered St. Louis, the capital of our possessions on the West African\r\ncoast. While nobody talks anything but sugar at Martinique, nor cod in\r\nNewfoundland, at St. Louis the only subject of conversation is GUM. It\r\nis its staple product, and indeed is found nowhere else, except in\r\nArabia.\r\n\r\nThe gum forests are in country belonging to the Arabs, on the right\r\nbank of the Senegal river, and are consequently in the hands of the\r\nMoors, who carry the produce to the river. The various stations we have\r\nestablished along its course are intended for the protection of the\r\ntraders or coloured agents, acting as intermediaries between the\r\nnatives, and the white merchants, unable themselves to face the deadly\r\nclimate, and also to close the road to the British markets on the\r\nGambia river to the Moors. To the garrisons of these stations, regular\r\ncharnel-houses, our officers and men come out to die, or else to catch\r\nthe germ of some incurable illness. I learn that nowadays, by dint of\r\nusing quinine as a preventive, and of improvements in some other\r\nrespects, the effects of the unhealthy climate have been somewhat\r\nreduced, but when I was there the condition of things was really\r\nterrible. So my first care, when I reached St. Louis, was to go and see\r\nthe victims of duty in the hospital into which they were crowded, and\r\nmy heart swelled at the sight of all the poor yellow wasted faces many\r\nof them already bearing the signs of approaching dissolution. Poor\r\nbrave fellows! How I wished I had crosses to pin on all their breasts,\r\nto soften the last moments of the life they had given for their\r\ncountry, by a sign of its remembrance of them! But I had not one, and I\r\ncould not help feeling furious at the thought that we were close on New\r\nYear's day, and that a perfect rain of honours was about to fall on a\r\nheap of theatrical directors who had done special service to the\r\ngovernment, and private secretaries, and political writers, who had\r\nnever been off the Boulevards, the favoured elect of the world of\r\npolitics--those odious politics! The dismal, ill-built, rickety\r\nhospital was perfectly well managed at all events, thanks to our naval\r\nsurgeons, and also to our admirable sisters of charity, whose names I\r\ncannot pronounce without indulging in another and an indignant\r\ndigression.\r\n\r\nCan we really have fallen so low as to tolerate that these holy and\r\nnoble women, who have lightened so much suffering, and so worthily\r\nsustained the good name of France all over the world, should be\r\nsacrificed in these latter days to a pack of public-house reformers and\r\nwould-be strong-minded freethinkers?\r\n\r\nFrom the hospital, that ante-chamber of death, I went to the barracks\r\nfor the living, mere dens, built by St. Routine to sealed pattern, at\r\nso much a foot, identically the same in every climate, and absolutely\r\nunsuitable for any. How different from the spacious, airy, comfortable\r\nedifices raised by the English for the comfort and well-being of their\r\ncolonial garrisons!\r\n\r\nSt. Louis is built beside a river, the flat banks of which are seen\r\nstretching away hedged in by masses of green vegetation. In the\r\nmornings the town is usually wrapped in an unhealthy fog. Yet this is\r\nthe moment at which the inhabitants are to be seen languidly dragging\r\nthemselves along the straight sandy streets, between the negro huts and\r\na few white houses with terraces before them. When the fog lifts the\r\nplace is nothing but a scorching desert. I was to have gone up the\r\nriver to inspect our military stations and their garrisons, but the\r\nonly available boat was detained outside the bar across the mouth of\r\nthe river, which was absolutely impassable. After waiting for it in\r\nvain for several days, I left St. Louis for Goree and Dakar.\r\n\r\nAt Goree I once more saw the pretty signares, a regularly enlisted\r\ncompany of mulatto women, which furnishes our officers, civil and\r\nmilitary, with wives and housekeepers during their turn of colonial\r\nservice. Then I came again upon my friend the King of Dakar, an old\r\nacquaintance of mine, who sent me his compliments by his \"general of\r\ncavalry,\" a perfect giant in stature, excessively thin, who wore a\r\nstock and a cocked hat, and no breeches.\r\n\r\nAt Goree I embarked on board the colonial despatch boat Galibi to\r\ninspect our stations on the Gambia and the Cazamanze. This vessel was\r\nherself a curiosity, not indeed as a ship of war, for she was a fine\r\nlittle steam despatch boat, armed with four guns, but on account of the\r\norganisation and composition of her crew. There were only four whites\r\non board--the lieutenant in command, a poor fellow who was soon to fall\r\na victim to the climate and die at his post, a clerk, an engineer, and\r\na master-gunner. All the rest of the crew were negroes, hypocritically\r\ndenominated Government prisoners, whose whole costume, as a rule,\r\nconsisted of a monkey-skin cap and a string of grigris, or charms,\r\nround their waists. \"Haven't you ever tried to dress them?\" said I to\r\nthe lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, but as soon as they get on shore they instantly sell their\r\nthings, or give them away to their women, and come back naked. So I\r\nhave given it up.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it was time for us to start, the captain owned to me that none of\r\nthe crew had ever known how to steer, except one negro, who acted as\r\nhis butler, and he could only steer in a river, by keeping the ship at\r\nan equal distance from the two banks. He had never been able to\r\nunderstand anything about steering by the compass at sea. As we had to\r\ngo a certain distance at sea before reaching the mouth of the rivers, I\r\ntook on board a whaler and crew from my frigate, and my men went to the\r\nwheel. But now a fresh difficulty arose. The single engineer could not\r\nstop by his engine for ever, without taking any rest. Now and then the\r\ncare of the machinery had to be confided to a negro, whom he had\r\ntrained after a certain fashion, and I confess I felt far from easy\r\nwhen I saw him handling the levers and taps with all the\r\nself-confidence of a monkey showing off a magic lantern. Besides our\r\nnegro crew, there was a perfect menagerie of creatures loose on board.\r\nGazelles, which were inoffensive enough, I must grant, a legion of\r\nill-behaved monkeys, and a tame civet. The monkeys never stopped\r\nplaying spiteful tricks on everybody all day long, and at night they\r\nall huddled together, clasping each other, with their tails sticking\r\nout like the rays of a star or the spokes of a wheel. If by anybody's\r\nfault or misfortune one of those tails got trodden on, the whole\r\ncluster of monkeys yelled for an hour, just as journalists do if a\r\nfinger is laid on one of their fraternity. As for the civet, she used\r\nto offer her company as bed-fellow to each of us in turn, and it was of\r\nthe most stinking and disagreeable kind.\r\n\r\nWe soon reached the mouth of the Gambia River, and, entering it through\r\na labyrinth of sandbanks, we saw a wide stream with flat shores covered\r\nwith mangrove swamps, behind which aquatic form of vegetation huge\r\ntrees rose, fantastically tall, and in all the splendour of their\r\ntropical growth. All the rivers of the West African coast present this\r\nidentically same appearance. We had hardly entered this one before we\r\nwere confronted by one of those international questions which swarm on\r\nthe coast in this part of the globe. The Gambia is a British river, but\r\non its banks is a territory belonging to us, called Albreda, which I\r\nwas about to visit. Had we a right to go there direct, up the English\r\nwaters of the Gambia, or ought we to stop first of all at St. Mary\r\nBathurst, the capital of the British possessions on the river, to ask\r\npermission to do so? If a merchant vessel, French or otherwise, tried\r\nto get up to Albreda, the British stopped her by fair words or force,\r\nto maintain their right. But this we were contesting, and as the\r\nbusiness was still in suspense, I passed St. Mary Bathurst without\r\nstopping, and anchored at Albreda. It is not a very important factory.\r\nI was received by four white men and a crowd of negroes. The white\r\ninhabitant stretched on a couch under the veranda of the one-storied\r\nhouse in which he dwells, has no society beyond that of the signare,\r\nwho acts provisionally as his wife, and the crowd of slaves of both\r\nsexes who go and come around him. Fever lurks on every side, and\r\ncarries him off on the slightest imprudence. But it is a rich country,\r\nfor it is inhabited by a race of negroes, fervent Mussulmans, who are\r\nindustrious workers, and the produce of their industry is a lucrative\r\narticle of barter. In the evening, after a long walk through the woods,\r\nbalmy with a thousand sweet scents, where flights of lovely birds,\r\nlong-tailed parrokeets, and black-plumaged widow birds, perched in the\r\ntrees, I saw a small British vessel approach, and an officer put off\r\nfrom her. He had been sent by the governor, who was on board, and had\r\nbeen going up the river to call on the captain of the French ship, and\r\nexpress his regret at not having seen him at Bathurst in the morning--a\r\ncovert complaint, in fact. On hearing who I was, and that I expected to\r\ngo to Bathurst the following day, he sent me word that he would return\r\nand receive me there.\r\n\r\nThe flagstaff on which our colours had been hoisted having fallen down,\r\nI had it set up again. It was necessary in a disputed country, such as\r\nthis was, and pending the Government's decision, that our flag should\r\nwave over our colonists, and protect them from all insult.\r\n\r\nThen I landed at Bathurst. Our captives, anxiously directed by the\r\nmaster-gunner, contrived somehow or other to fire a salute of\r\ntwenty-one guns, which was instantly returned from the British forts,\r\nand I went ashore in the whale-boat I had brought from the Belle-Poule.\r\nThe commander of the Galibi, who wanted to escort me, had manned a boat\r\nand rigged out his men for the nonce in smart striped shirts and red\r\ncaps. Wonderful to relate, they were so electrified by the reception I\r\nwas given, and the example of my white crew, that they brought both\r\nshirts and caps faithfully back! I was received on the beach by a\r\ncompany of what in those days was called the Royal African\r\nCorps--splendid black troops, officered by white men. I had a great\r\ndeal of conversation with the governor, a very sensible man, who\r\nexpressed the hope that my visit would result in a prompt settlement of\r\na state of local affairs which might give rise to the most serious\r\ndifficulties. He was exceedingly civil to me, and gave me a very fine\r\ndinner-party, before which I was somewhat astonished to see \"the\r\nladies\" appear in the drawing-room, in the shape of three very dark\r\nmulattoes, in full evening dress--low bodices, lace\r\npocket-handkerchiefs, and fans. The doors of the dining-room having\r\njust been thrown open, the governor indicated to me by a gesture that I\r\nwas to take one of these ladies into dinner. Not knowing which of them\r\nshould take precedence, I held my arm out in the middle of the\r\ndrawing-room, and one of the dark-skinned ladies blushingly put hers\r\nwithin it. Many years afterwards, dining at Washington with that\r\nagreeable man, Charles Sumner, the great abolitionist, and some very\r\ncharming ladies, I amused myself by telling him about my Bathurst\r\ndinner, and asked him whether HE had ever given his arm to a negress. I\r\nawaited his answer with some curiosity, to see whether he would dare\r\nanswer in the affirmative before the American ladies, who are so\r\nsensitive on the colour question, but he got out of it very adroitly.\r\n\"My dear Prince,\" said he, \"in every religion each man has his own\r\nshare of work. I preach and you practise. Don't let us mix the two\r\nthings up together.\"\r\n\r\nAs we were steaming out of the Gambia I saw the commander of the Galibi\r\non his bridge, in a state of violent excitement, with all his crew\r\nmustered before him, and appealing in the most vehement manner to his\r\ncapitaine de riviere (river captain), the title borne by the chief of\r\nthe negro crew. I joined him, and he said, \"I've just been mustering\r\nthe men. I can't recollect all the fellows' names, so I count heads.\r\nI've done it over again four or five times, and there is always one man\r\ntoo many.\" And then he began to yell again, \"Capitaine de riviere!\r\nWhat's the meaning of this? There's a man too many!\" The capitaine de\r\nriviere, who had stationed himself well forward, pretended not to hear,\r\nbut, driven at last from his refuge, he came aft, pulling off his\r\nbell-crowned hat, the distinctive sign of his authority, and,\r\nuncovering his shock of gray hair, like a woollen travelling cap,\r\nmurmured in his gentlest tones, \"Please, sir, he's a LITTLE PRESENT I\r\nwas given at Bathurst!\"\r\n\r\nWe were soon in the Cazamanze, after having very nearly been lost on\r\nthe sandbanks obstructing the entrance to the river, on which the sea\r\nbreaks furiously. The river is a fine one, wide and deep. I steamed up\r\nit for about a hundred miles. After the few villages near the mouth we\r\ncame to a desert country, covered with impenetrable forest and jungle.\r\nWe steamed along between two walls of green, and our only excitement as\r\nwe went was to watch the numerous hippopotami, who seemed very much put\r\nout by the passing of the Galibi. As we neared our station at Sedhiou,\r\nwhich I was going to inspect, we noticed several villages, the\r\ninhabitants of which greeted us with yells. The jungle had been cleared\r\naround the houses, over which the great trees stood like huge parasols.\r\nSo gigantic was the growth, that sometimes a whole village was\r\nsheltered by one and the same tree. The post of Sedhiou--a brick-built\r\nfort, with a little bastion armed with a gun at each corner--is placed\r\nat a point of great importance on the caravan line from the interior. I\r\nwas received by an infantry captain, M. Dallin, who had done the most\r\nexcellent service there, but ruined his health, and by two white\r\nsoldiers, both wasted by fever. The rest of the garrison consisted of\r\nblack soldiers, splendid fellows, brave and faithful, and excellent\r\nworkmen, who had done, and were still doing, all the work on the\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nThinking of those fine soldiers, and then casting back my memory to the\r\nservices recently rendered by their successors, the Senegalese\r\nRiflemen--first-class troops, useful anywhere, like our Algerian\r\nTurcos, who have already proved what they are worth--I ask myself why\r\nwe should not utilise the considerable recruiting opportunities Western\r\nAfrica offers us to raise a number of negro battalions. They might if\r\nproperly enlisted be most usefully employed, especially in those\r\nunhealthy countries where we now squander so many invaluable lives. I\r\nwill even go further, for it is my conviction that in thus acting we\r\nshould be preparing for the future, and outstripping the march of\r\nevents. The state of armed preparation which now exists in Europe--with\r\nevery man a soldier, and forced to be a soldier, with every man's\r\ncareer interrupted, and each man's existence hanging on the chance of\r\nan electoral surprise or a parliamentary incident--cannot possibly\r\nlast. It is unhappily to be feared that to escape from this insane\r\ncondition of things some violent shock will be necessary, which will\r\nmake a clean sweep of the false notions dressed up in fine names which\r\nwe have been accumulating for the past century. When that crisis is\r\nover, people will want to be free, as Americans are free--free to do\r\nand to be WHAT THEY CHOOSE, and, especially, free not to be soldiers\r\nUNLESS THEY CHOOSE. There can be no doubt at all that those inventions\r\nof revolutionary tyranny, conscription and compulsory service, will\r\nbecome the object of universal horror, and that the first person who\r\ndares to take the initiative in abolishing them will be saluted by the\r\nblessings of the entire human race. Wherefore every government will\r\nperforce have to come to what is right and just--to armies consisting\r\nof volunteers and auxiliaries. And who knows whether we shall not then\r\nfind the real strength of our army in our black regiments, just as\r\nRussia would in her yellow-skinned ones and Great Britain in her Indian\r\ntroops? But I must bring this digression to a close.\r\n\r\nAs we steamed down the Cazamanze we ran aground, and while the ship was\r\nbeing got off I went ashore, in a creek, where at the very outset I\r\ndisturbed the slumbers of a couple of crocodiles sleeping on a stone. A\r\nmoment later I was nearly knocked over by a big boar with reddish\r\nbristles and up-curved fangs, a \"wart hog.\" Then I got into the brush,\r\ntall grass much higher than myself, above which hung the green roof of\r\nthe giant trees. Pushing my way along I came to a place where the\r\nground was trodden and the branches broken, and on which I saw the\r\ntraces and fresh tracks of a herd of elephants. Close to me, too, I\r\nheard the crackling caused by the passage of some big animal which I\r\ncould not see. We followed the elephants' path, but hindered by the\r\ngrasses they had trodden down, and our feet catching in the holes made\r\nin the damp soil by their huge feet, we were soon forced to beat a\r\nretreat. Another wild beast's track led us to an immense glade, like a\r\nsmall plain, hemmed in by the woods, where we saw herds of antelope\r\nquietly feeding. We started in pursuit of them, but like the ducks on\r\nthe ponds, the creatures seemed to have a very correct appreciation of\r\nthe distance our guns would carry and the impotent fire we poured on\r\nthem disturbed them not. Not a single beast even left the plain to take\r\nshelter in the woods, where we could hear the greater wild ones\r\nhowling. Ah! if we had possessed long-range weapons, what a shoot we\r\nshould have had, and what a paradise of sport that virgin country was!\r\nBut one victim only fell to our rifles, a big monkey, which one of our\r\nsailors killed, and which he and his comrades eat. It was, so it would\r\nappear, a dish to lick your lips over!\r\n\r\nFor want of game we brought something else back with us from this\r\nexpedition up the Gambia and Cazamanze rivers--fever. Not a soul\r\nescaped it, and in spite of the care of the surgeon-major of the\r\nBelle-Poule, who was particularly skilful in treating the malady, we\r\ntook a long time to get over it. I went back to Goree, where I was to\r\nsee another sad sight. One of our gunboats had come in from a\r\nriver-station with only four healthy men out of seventy-five. Typhus\r\nfever was decimating the crew. I had to present the Cross of the Legion\r\nof Honour to the lieutenant in command, M. de Langle, who had behaved\r\nlike a hero. I went alongside his ship to see him in the lonely creek\r\nto which the infected vessel had been relegated. A crowd of spectral\r\nfigures crept to the ports to look at me. It was a pitiful scene.\r\n\r\nI had by this time gone the round of nearly all our possessions along\r\nthe West Coast of Africa, and the impression I was carrying away was\r\nfar from being a good one. On this coast, as elsewhere, France\r\noriginally outstripped all other nations, and the first European\r\nexpeditions to the Black Continent were sent out from Dieppe during the\r\nfourteenth century. The principal merchandise they brought back\r\nconsisted of ivory, and the branch of industry occupied by working this\r\nsubstance still exists in that town at the present day. Up to the\r\neighteenth century all the important factories on the coast were in our\r\nhands. After that date, just as in India and America, where also we had\r\nbeen the earliest colonists, everything began to go to ruin, and our\r\npossessions dwindled to the unimportant posts I had just been to see.\r\nSince my visit an effort has been made to recommence some extension of\r\nour factories and trade in the locality. The question is whether it\r\nwill be successful, and, above all, whether, amidst the vicissitudes of\r\nour politics and the constant state of provisional arrangement in which\r\nwe live, we possess the coherence and connectedness of design and\r\nsystem necessary to that success. I pray it may be so! But there are\r\ntwo insurmountable obstacles which will always prove stumbling-blocks\r\nto us--the unhealthy climate, deathly indeed to white men, and the\r\nblack population, a childish race, who may be disciplined into being\r\ngood soldiers, but who will never work except when made to by force,\r\nand that brute force.\r\n\r\nBefore continuing our cruise along the African coast, the squadron (the\r\nBelle Poule and Africaine, frigates, and Coquette, corvette) went to\r\nthe Cape Verd Islands, both to give the crews change of air, to test\r\nthe speed of the various vessels, and to take in fresh provisions. This\r\nlast object was defeated, in consequence of a curious circumstance. A\r\nPortuguese station in the Bissago Archipelago had been attacked by the\r\nnegroes, and when reinforcements had been asked for, the government at\r\nLisbon had answered by sending two transports to fetch troops from the\r\nCape Verd Islands,--from Porto-Praya, where we had anchored, in\r\nparticular,--and to convey them to the threatened spot. But before\r\nembarking troops they had to be found, and there were none, or rather\r\nthey existed on paper only. To supply the want and respond to the\r\npressing appeal made to him the governor could devise no better plan\r\nthan to set an ambush at the gates of the different towns, seize the\r\ncountry people as they came in, and send them away as soldiers. Of\r\ncourse, when once wind of this got about, nobody came in, the markets\r\nwere deserted, and the towns were famine-stricken. Although the Cape\r\nVerd Islands appear from sea to be nothing but arid mountains, with\r\nbare rocks and rugged slopes, they really are furrowed with delightful\r\nvalleys, covered with leafy woods, where innumerable monkeys peacefully\r\ndwell, and in which the flocks of guinea-fowl inhabiting the open\r\nspaces on the islands take refuge from pursuit. There is no more\r\ncurious sight to be seen than these mobs of birds, two or three hundred\r\nof them together, tearing along like a contingent of Arab horsemen, at\r\nsuch a rapid pace that it is impossible to come up with them, on that\r\nrocky soil, even with the best of horses. A native of the island gave\r\nus a luncheon in one of the valleys of which I speak. His house, which\r\nwas reached through an avenue of cocoa-palms, stood in the middle of a\r\ngrove of enormous orange-trees, over sixty feet in height. We were\r\nwaited on at table by handsome negresses, slaves; and these, according\r\nto our host, were the conditions of their life. Their time, except on\r\nSundays, belonged to their master, who, in return, gave them their\r\nfood, and, when necessary, an occasional beating. They dressed\r\nthemselves out of the money they earned--Heaven knows how!--lodged\r\nwhere they best could, and were given a bonus whenever they had a\r\nchild--a young slave to add to their owner's stock. It was a simple\r\narrangement enough. On my return to the African coast, I was to tumble\r\nheadlong into all the questions contingent on the slave system, the\r\nsuppression of the slave trade, which still existed, and the whole\r\nfuture of the negro race.\r\n\r\nSierra Leone, our first port, differs from the rest of the invariably\r\nflat African coasts by reason of its background of high mountains, and\r\nthe green hills which run down right to the seashore. Between these\r\nhills lies the mouth of a great river, forming an excellent haven, and\r\na first-rate military and commercial station. But the place is terribly\r\nunhealthy. To give us a taste of local colour, we were surrounded,\r\nbefore we got into the river, by hosts of sharks, and in a few minutes\r\nwe had hoisted five of the huge fishes on board. Then no sooner had we\r\ncast anchor before Freetown, than a gentleman of a certain age, in a\r\nblue coat and white nankeen trousers and a top hat, appeared, asking\r\nspeech of the captain. He was sent to me. \"Captain,\" said he, \"I've\r\ncome to know how many ladies will be wanted for the frigate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, sir,\" I replied in some astonishment, \"I don't know; I've not\r\nthought about it yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see I make it my business, sir, when a man-o'-war comes into port,\r\nto come and offer my services.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, I'm much obliged to you, I won't give you any special\r\norder; I'll leave the business completely to itself.\"\r\n\r\nI never heard why he was so anxious to make sure of a monopoly in his\r\nline of business. Apart from this little incident, our stay in this\r\nport, during which we were treated in the most friendly manner by the\r\nkindliest of governors and his lady, was in no way different from any\r\nother.\r\n\r\nYet Sierra Leone was interesting as being the headquarters of the\r\nBritish naval station, established to suppress the slave trade, and as\r\nbeing the place where the slave cargoes found on board the captured\r\nslavers were landed. Freetown and its neighbourhood was full of these\r\npoor wretches, who were denominated, somewhat hypocritically, liberated\r\nAfricans; but the government took good care not to liberate them, and\r\nthere indeed it was right. To have turned out these human cattle, swept\r\nup in distant raids, now far from home and country, would have been to\r\ncast them infallibly into the clutches of cruel and pitiless native\r\nmasters, who would keep back what they could not sell for human\r\nsacrifices or cannibal banquets. It was mere common humanity therefore,\r\nto keep them safe, once they had been caught. But to avoid feeding\r\nuseless mouths, the finest men were enrolled as soldiers--the British\r\ngovernment, ever in advance of others, applying a law of compulsory\r\nservice, unlimited in period, to their case. The recruiting service\r\nonce satisfied, the rest of the poor devils were turned, willy-nilly,\r\ninto \"free labourers,\" and the greater part of them were sent as such\r\nto the British Antilles. The ship that bore them thither was no longer\r\ncalled a slaver, and her cargo were not slaves. But if the names were\r\nchanged, the things themselves were terribly alike. Yet philanthropy\r\nand sentimentality were satisfied. And so were the captains and crews\r\nof the British cruisers, for hunting slavers is a lucrative business,\r\nand the prize money earned made them forget the unhealthiness of the\r\nclimate and the monotony of the blockade.\r\n\r\nThe passion for lucre excited on both sides gave rise to actions which\r\nbordered on sheer piracy, concerning which many a tale fell on my ear\r\nall along the Guinea coast. Thus one Frenchman I met had been in\r\ncommand of a Spanish slaver, which was lying becalmed. He victoriously\r\nrepulsed the attacking boats of a British cruiser, and killed the\r\nlieutenant in command of her, who was the first to board the\r\nslave-ship, with his own hand. A slight breeze and the fall of night\r\nenabled him to make good his escape. But no more of this. The negro\r\ntrade and the suppression of it, the abuses on both sides, are all of\r\nthem bygone things, bereft of interest. Slavery is the one thing that\r\nremains. It always has existed in Africa, and the steady progress made\r\nin that part of the globe by the Mohammedan religion, which admits\r\nslavery, as the basis of the social system, will no doubt still further\r\nhelp to perpetuate it. Should all the black tribes merge into one huge\r\nMussulman body, stirred at once by religious fanaticism and by a\r\npassion for slavery, a formidable difficulty will be added to those\r\nwhich already confront European action in the continent inhabited by\r\nthe sons of Ham.\r\n\r\nFrom the liberated Africans of Sierra Leone we came to another\r\ncategory. A negro republic, with all the necessary\r\nimpedimenta--elections, assemblies, newspapers, and the most\r\nexaggerated form of Protestant Puritanism to boot. This Liberian\r\nRepublic, founded by an American religious body, is a sort of El Dorado\r\nfor the exclusive benefit of freed negroes from the United States, and\r\nis absolutely forbidden ground to the white race. After great\r\ndifficulties to begin with, after being abandoned and repopulated more\r\nthan once, after times of scarcity during which the miserable freed men\r\nbitterly regretted their lost servitude, the republic has ended by\r\ntaking root. There were about ten thousand inhabitants, doing nothing\r\nat all, for the free negro thinks and says, like his slave brother,\r\n\"Work no good!\" What did they live on then? First of all, on the\r\nsunshine, and then by doing a kind of broker's work between passing\r\nships and the natives. They vegetated in fact, and if they did not\r\nactually rot in idleness, they owed it to a tall Virginian mulatto, a\r\nvery intelligent fellow, extraordinarily like Alphonse Karr in\r\nappearance, \"Governor Roberts,\" with whom I had several long and\r\ninteresting talks. He had been sharp enough to get hold of the key of\r\nthe cashbox, and by that act had become the sole representative of the\r\nsovereign people. In spite of the constitution, in spite of laws and\r\nregulations, all power was concentrated in his hands, and, save for the\r\nname, his republic was transformed into a tidy little dictatorship.\r\n\r\nLeaving Liberia, we slipped away down the Ivory Coast and the Gold\r\nCoast, driven gently along by a scorching wind called the Harmattan.\r\nOur charts were primitive and incomplete, the information they gave\r\nquite inadequate. We had to steer by soundings, very cautiously. The\r\ncoast was uniformly low and green, with no distinctive signs upon it.\r\nIf we wanted to know where we were, we had to go after some canoe full\r\nof fishermen, and ask our way, hat in hand, as one does in the street.\r\nIt was a funny sight to see the great black hull of the Belle-Poule,\r\nwith her white sails scarcely filled by the light breeze, hugging the\r\nland, amongst a crowd of canoes full of noisy stark naked savages, hung\r\nwith necklaces, and with arrows stuck in their heads of fuzzy hair,\r\nlooking like handfuls of horse-hair pulled out of a mattress and\r\nclipped into any number of different shapes. A regular market went on\r\nalongside. Our sailors would pass down a biscuit or some other thing in\r\ntheir caps, and haul them up again with pineapples, or bananas, or\r\nfish, or perhaps a gray parrot. Thus we sailed along till we came to\r\nsome great forts, whose white walls bristled with cannon--Axim, Elmina,\r\nCape Coast Cattle--the two first flying the Dutch, the last one, the\r\nBritish flag. All along the Gold Coast and the Slave Coast we were to\r\ncome upon these forts, originally constructed to ensure the humane\r\nmanagement of the slave trade, nowadays become very burdensome\r\nstations, of no value but as marts for the barter of palm oil,\r\noleaginous nuts, and ivory on the one part, against gunpowder, brandy,\r\nglass beads, matches, and the blue cotton cloth known as \"guinea cloth\"\r\non the other. I went from Elmina, where the Dutch officers were most\r\nfriendly, to Cape Coast, by land, in a palanquin. My companions\r\ntravelled in baskets shaped like Egyptian mummies, which tall negroes\r\ncarried on their heads, without putting their hands to them. It was not\r\nsafe to stir! At Cape Coast, I found yet another mode of locomotion.\r\nGovernor Maclean took me for a long expedition along the road towards\r\nCoomassie, the Ashanti King's capital. We travelled in a small\r\nvictoria, to which was harnessed a four-in-hand of splendid negroes,\r\nwhose backs bore the marks of terrible floggings. In spite of the sandy\r\nroad, the team went gaily along full trot, urged forward by the\r\nGovernor's incessant cry of \"Get on faster, boys!\" Then I went back on\r\nboard and steered for Accra, another group of forts. Thence to\r\nCrevecoeur, a Dutch fort, and Christianborg, a Danish one, the governor\r\nof which, a charming young fellow, came off to see me. Living as he did\r\nalone amongst the blacks, he was delighted to find himself amongst\r\npeople of his own kind again, for a few minutes.\r\n\r\nThe following day we landed in canoes, for the bar was rough, and I had\r\nbeen charitably warned not to put my arm or hand into the water. Only a\r\nfew days previously an unlucky French sailor, who had wanted to get\r\nback his hat, which had fallen into the water, had had an arm seized\r\nand taken off by a shark. I did as I was bid; we plunged into the surf,\r\nand got through without any drawbacks. Just as I reached the shore a\r\ntremendous fusillade began. It was a reception after the local fashion,\r\nwhich had been prepared for me: over three thousand dancing natives\r\ndoing a sort of Arab fantasia on foot. They wore shell necklaces and\r\nbracelets on their arms and legs. Some had caps made of wild beasts'\r\nskins, or circlets of turkey's feathers on their heads; others again\r\nhad gold horns on their foreheads. Everybody was shouting and writhing\r\nabout and firing off guns; the elders of the tribe pressed round me\r\nwith dancing attendants behind them, who held huge coloured parasols\r\nover their heads. The women exerted themselves as much as the men,\r\nperforming the most extravagant and peculiar dances to the sound of\r\ntwenty or thirty tomtoms, or great drums, six feet long. The whole\r\nthing made the most extraordinary clatter and uproar. When we got near\r\nthe fort, the crowd executed a sham assault on it, the big gun in the\r\ncitadel was fired, and I made my triumphal entry between two rows of\r\nsoldiers in red Danish uniforms. Nothing could have been more\r\npicturesque.\r\n\r\nThe governor gave us a splendid lunch, in the European style, in a big\r\nroom in the fort. The only thing that was African about it was the\r\nwaiting, which certainly did not lack local colour; for it was done by\r\na score of young negresses, selected for the irreproachable beauty of\r\ntheir forms, which no veil, not even the very tiniest, concealed. There\r\nthey stood, plate in hand, and napkin under arm, without the smallest\r\nshyness, seeing indeed they wore the dress(!) of the country. Imagine\r\nthe bronze caryatidae round the new Paris Opera House come down off\r\ntheir pedestals, and handing round the dishes at a big Parisian\r\ndinner-party! All these young ladies' coquetry had gone to the dressing\r\nof their woolly hair, which was clipped, like garden shrubs, into the\r\nmost fanciful shapes, and to the fineness of their skins, which were as\r\nsoft and shiny as satin. This resulted from the daily baths they were\r\nin the habit of taking, rubbing themselves also with fine sand. But,\r\nunluckily, the rubbing could not get rid of the negro scent. I have\r\nnever been able myself to endure the odour of negroes of either sex;\r\nbut I have known people whom it quite intoxicated, and who were always\r\ntrying to get reappointed to Senegal, so as to get back to it, in spite\r\nof having had their health shattered by African fevers. It is said,\r\ntoo, to attract sharks, and that if a white man bathes with a negro\r\nwhere they swarm, the negro is always seized first. I have no personal\r\nexperience of this fact.\r\n\r\nA hundred miles west of the forts of Accra we found ourselves opposite\r\nWidah, the chief mart of the kingdom of Dahomey. From the sea we looked\r\non a sort of sandy dyke, on which the waves broke furiously. Behind the\r\ndyke lay a wide lagoon, some of it a mere marsh, and beyond the lagoon\r\nthe flags of France, Spain, and Brazil floated over some forts and\r\nlarge white European houses. It was the first time we had seen our flag\r\nwaving on any spot on the coast since leaving Senegal, and we were very\r\neager to go and see the station it sheltered. Landing was no easy\r\nmatter, and I waited a long time in a big canoe, manned by twenty\r\npaddlers kneeling forward, before the old negro in the stern decided\r\nthe attempt to be possible. He never stopped invoking every fetish\r\nunder the sun, and sprinkling the sea out of a brandy bottle, keeping\r\nhis eye the while on the waves as they came rolling in. Then all at\r\nonce he gave a great shout, loudly responded to by the twenty paddlers,\r\nwho yelled in cadence, while the canoe flew before the united and\r\nfrenzied strokes of their paddles. Two enormous waves passed, leaving\r\nus undamaged; but a third approached, huge and threatening. Should we\r\nget to the shore before it? Would it rise upright and capsize us, or\r\nwould it break on us and swamp us? Neither. It did reach us, indeed,\r\nbut the old steersman had calculated well; it lifted us up unharmed and\r\ncarried us on to the beach, where a hundred negroes laid hold of the\r\ncanoe and dragged it high and dry. I was seized myself before I had\r\ntime to collect my ideas, and put into a hammock hung upon a long pole,\r\nwhich five or six tall negroes held horizontally, with arms\r\noutstretched above their heads, during the time it took to cross the\r\nlagoon, where the water was waist high. They set me down at last, at\r\nthe gate of the French fort, in the middle of an immense crowd, much\r\nexcited at the arrival of a French squadron--there were three ships.\r\n\r\nWidah had been, and still was, a very important slave station. France,\r\nEngland, and Portugal had in former days possessed forts there, and had\r\nsuccessively abandoned them. The Portuguese, Spanish, and Brazilian\r\nfactories alone remained in possession of the trade in that country.\r\nThey sold European goods to the King of Dahomey, taking slaves, of whom\r\nthey had formerly exported large numbers, in exchange, and this was a\r\nsource of great riches. But at the time I speak of, with the British\r\ncruisers about, hardly one slaver got through out of every ten. The\r\nKing of Dahomey had a glut of slaves on his hands, and cleared them off\r\nby massacring them as human sacrifices at idol feasts. One Frenchman,\r\nM. Provencal, of the firm of Regis, at Marseilles, had lately rehoisted\r\nthe national colours at the French fort, rebuilt the dwellings, and set\r\nto work to do legitimate trade, offering his goods to the King of\r\nDahomey, and taking nothing in exchange but palm-oil and similar\r\nproduce. If the slave trade is put down--and when I was on that coast\r\nits days seemed already numbered--that enterprising and plucky\r\nFrenchman will have done more to civilise those countries than all the\r\nmore violent measures have accomplished. I was very glad to notice his\r\naction, and gave him the heartiest encouragement to persevere in it.\r\nThe courtyard of the station was already full of casks of palm-oil,\r\nwhich augured well.\r\n\r\nImmediately on my arrival I received a visit from the Avogal, the King\r\nof Dahomey's governor at Widah, a big healthy-looking negro, with whom\r\nthe only conversation I had was of the most commonplace description. He\r\nwas accompanied by two other blacks, with intelligent faces and sharp\r\neyes, who sat on each side of him without speaking a word, and departed\r\nequally silently. \"Those are the censors,\" said M. Provencal. \"Each of\r\nthe King's officials is always attended in that fashion to report all\r\nhe says and does. If the King should be dissatisfied with him he has\r\nhis head cut off.\" If this habit was universal there would be fewer\r\noffice seekers. This king ruled after the antique pattern. He had kept\r\nall his seignorial rights. If any of his subjects married a wife the\r\nlady had first to be presented to him, and if he liked her he kept her.\r\nHis authority was unlimited in fact; nevertheless, powerful though he\r\nmight be, he was likely to find it hard to change his subjects from\r\nslave-hunters into oil growers.\r\n\r\nAfter the Avogal's visit I went to pay one in my turn to a strange\r\nindividual, more of a king in Widah than the King of Dahomey himself,\r\nwho could not do without him,--for he supplied him with guns and\r\ngunpowder for his wars, and brandy wherewith to intoxicate his Amazons.\r\nThis personage, a Brazilian of the name of Don Francisco de Souza, but\r\nknown invariably as Cha-Cha, had been settled at Widah for forty-three\r\nyears. He was a veteran slaver, from whom the British had captured\r\nthirty-four ships, two of them quite recently. A little old man, with\r\nquick eyes and an expressive countenance, he was credited with having\r\ntwo thousand slaves in his barracoons, and with being the father of\r\neighty male children--the girls had never been thought worth reckoning\r\nup. All his sons had been properly brought up. I saw them walking about\r\nin all directions, uniformly dressed in white suits, and wearing Panama\r\nhats. Most of them were very handsome mulattoes.\r\n\r\nThe state of the surf, which was impassable, prevented me from getting\r\nback on board, so it was settled that I should dine with Cha-Cha, and\r\nsleep at the French fort, where I installed myself in the former\r\nquarters of the governor, which I shared with M. Provencal. Rather a\r\ncomical adventure befell me there. A very aged negro, formerly\r\ngatekeeper of the fort, when M. Dagneau commanded it for the King of\r\nFrance, had been to pay his respects to me in the morning, and I had\r\ncaused him to be given a present for himself and his family in the\r\nshape of a demijohn of brandy, which they first danced round and then\r\ncarried off, with great rejoicings. Well, the enthusiasm increased in\r\nmeasure as the contents of the demijohn disappeared, and towards\r\nevening the courtyard within the fort was invaded, to a great beating\r\nof tomtoms and clucking of women's tongues, by a huge crowd of\r\nDahomeyan negroes, preceded by a sort of corps de ballet of young\r\nnegresses, wriggling themselves about in every conceivable manner. At\r\ntheir head marched the ci-devant porter in a great state of excitement.\r\nHe began a fresh harangue in negro French.\r\n\r\n\"Croire Anglais tues tous Francais. Voir Francais. Trouver pere.\r\nContents, tous contents. Envoie commandant a nous. Pitit-Roi. Contents,\r\ntous contents. Tous femmes, tous filles a toi, tous contents!\" \"Think\r\nEnglish killed all French. See Frenchman. Find father. Glad, all glad.\r\nSent captain to us. Little king. Glad, all glad. All women, all girls\r\nfor you. All glad!\" And the young ladies smiled still broader, and\r\ncontorted their bodies still more violently, while the tomtoms crashed\r\nlouder than ever. It was clear the crowd expected something, and as it\r\ndid not see any sign of what it desired, the old negro became yet more\r\nexplicit both in speech and gesture. The populace actually expected me\r\nto provide them with a scion of the royal race! And the commander of\r\nthe Favorite, Larrieu, flew at me instantly. \"Come, Monseigneur,\" he\r\ncried, \"here's a chance of distinguishing yourself. Noblesse oblige!\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow,\" I replied, \"I leave you to represent me,\" and I beat\r\nan ignominious retreat, which the crowd did not misunderstand, to judge\r\nby the grunts of disappointment I overheard.\r\n\r\nThat night I dined with Cha-Cha off silver plate, under the light shed\r\nby church candelabra and candlesticks; and the toasts of the King and\r\nQueen, and Prosperity to France, were each saluted by twenty-one guns,\r\nfor Cha-Cha's factory and harem, in which he was said to keep a\r\nthousand women, formed a real fortress, bristling with cannon, and with\r\nthe additional natural defence of the lagoon before it. Most of\r\nCha-Cha's children were present at the dinner, and several captains of\r\nslave ships, brimful of stories of their adventures. Cha-Cha made me a\r\npresent of a box of Havanas, the like of which the King of all the\r\nSpains had never smoked. I handed it over to Larrieu, and the next day\r\nI returned on board my ship, not without having one or two encounters.\r\n\r\nThe first of these was with the freshly-landed crews of the slavers\r\nwhich had been captured the week before, about fifty determined-looking\r\nmen of all nationalities, who stopped me and requested in the most\r\narrogant manner to be taken to some port where they might reengage--an\r\nimpossible thing for me to do.\r\n\r\nThe second encounter was more painful. A crowd of lame or sickly slaves\r\nescaped from the barracoons and threw themselves at my feet, clinging\r\nto my clothes, wailing and beseeching me to buy them. The poor\r\nwretches, who had no market value, and whom therefore the King did not\r\ncare to feed, expected to be sent shortly to Abomey for human\r\nsacrifices. There were hundreds of them--a most distressing sight.\r\n\r\nAfter Widah our cruise took on a different aspect. We had come to that\r\npart of the coast called the Bights, consisting of the Gulfs of Biafra\r\nand Benin, between which lies the huge Niger Delta. The weather, which\r\ncontinued as scorching as ever, became excessively oppressive. The sky\r\nwas always dark and the rain never ceased. Sometimes a rift was seen in\r\nthe clouds in the distance, it would rapidly increase in size, taking a\r\nfunnel shape, and then a tornado would burst, like a tempest in\r\nminiature, lasting only three or four hours, but of extraordinary\r\nviolence. During one of these the Belle-Poule had to scud along under\r\nbare poles at the rate of twelve knots an hour. The weather was\r\nexcessively unhealthy, but in the whole course of this long cruise I\r\nnever lost but one man, who was carried off by a violent inflammation\r\nof the liver. I attribute this good fortune in the first place to the\r\nundoubted cleverness of our surgeon-major, Dr. Loze, whose whole career\r\nhad been spent in tropical waters. His theory was that quinine was only\r\nabsolutely efficacious if administered at a very fleeting moment in the\r\ncourse of the fever, between the hot and cold fits, and he always sat\r\nup with his patients himself, so as to catch the favourable\r\nopportunity. In the second place we took quite exceptional hygienic\r\nprecautions, especially against the night damp. The crew wore their\r\nwinter kit from sunset to sunrise. No man was allowed to lie down on\r\ndeck during the night watches, especially while the dew was falling.\r\nThey had to walk up and down the whole time, under an awning, which was\r\nalways kept up over the deck. In order to carry this out, we never had\r\nmore than half watches on duty at night. We had to navigate carefully\r\nand slowly, being short of hands, but the result was well worth the\r\ntemporary departure from the usual regulations for life on board a ship\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nI went up one of the arms by which the Niger pours it waters into the\r\nGulf of Guinea on board the Fine, a schooner belonging to the station,\r\ncommanded by Captain Lahalle. This arm, known as the Bonny River, is\r\nthe trading branch, the one down which passes all the produce which the\r\nmighty Niger--a completely navigable river, with neither cataracts nor\r\nrapids, the great future artery of Equatorial Africa--brings from the\r\ninterior of the continent. A negro king of the name of Pepel, more\r\nintelligent than his fellows, had constituted himself broker to this\r\nimportant trade. The European merchantmen coming up the river anchored\r\nbefore his town, made over their cargoes to him, and shipped palm-oil,\r\nthe chief riches of the country, in their stead. The drawback was that\r\nanything you do with negroes is slow work. Whether it was that the\r\npalm-oil, which came in canoes, and very irregularly, from high up the\r\nriver, did not arrive in sufficient quantities, or whether it was\r\ndeliberate delay on Pepel's part, a year would sometimes elapse before\r\nthe return cargo was completed, and sickness was meanwhile decimating\r\nthe crews. Some cases there had been in which everybody had died, in\r\nothers, ships had set sail in despair, without completing their full\r\ncargo, and Pepel had triumphed in his bad faith, until a man-of-war\r\ncame and made him disgorge. Several times already the authorities oft\r\nthe French station had had to chastise him, and it was a service to the\r\ntrade of every nation to go and show him one's teeth now and again.\r\nThis object it was, together with a certain amount of curiosity, which\r\nhad brought us to the Niger River.\r\n\r\nWhen we got to Pepel's town we found eight large Liverpool merchantmen,\r\npartly dismantled, and covered with roofs made of plantain leaves,\r\nsurrounded by canoes going incessantly to and from the shore, where\r\nhundreds of negroes loaded them with casks of palm-oil. There was a\r\nstir and commercial activity such as I had not yet seen anywhere on\r\nthat coast. The whole trade was exclusively English. To avoid the\r\nmortality to their crews, the English captains had their ships\r\ndismantled as soon as they got into the river, roofed the decks over,\r\nand sent their sailors back to England. The unloading and loading of\r\nthe ships were then done by negro labour, as soon as a ship's cargo was\r\ncompleted, she was manned and sent back to Liverpool with the crew of\r\nsome new arrival, and so on ad lib. It was very sensible, very well\r\nsuited to the circumstances of the case; but to carry out such a plan\r\nthe commercial houses must have had a great many ships, very large\r\ncapital, and a spirit of consistency in business affairs no longer\r\nexisting in our country. What with our unstable regime, and the\r\ninvariably provisional conditions under which we live, we could never\r\nthink of such a continuous struggle.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we had anchored and were preparing to go ashore, a great\r\nuproar attracted my attention, and caused me to hurry out of my cabin\r\non deck. An unhappy negro who had been bathing close to us, with\r\nnumerous companions of both sexes, had just been seized and carried off\r\nby a shark. We could still see the eddy above the spot where the\r\nmonster was devouring him. It was the second time I had witnessed such\r\na scene. These horrible creatures are \"fetish\" at the mouth of the\r\nBonny, where its waters join those of the new Calabar River, and human\r\nsacrifices are offered to them. In other words, on certain days of the\r\nyear, the people go in procession to the river bar and throw in some\r\nwretched children, who have been told they were being taken to a\r\nfestival. The sharks have a fine feast, to the joy of the onlookers,\r\nand amid much beating of tom-toms. This Jew-Jew, or shark-worship, is\r\none of the most abominable superstitions I have ever met with. At Widah\r\nthe snakes were \"fetish.\" Here at Bonny it was the lizards, which is\r\nless cruel. Yet they are hideous enough, those Bonny lizards, huge\r\ncreatures over a yard or a yard and a half long. They have temples of\r\ntheir own, where they are fed, and whence they sally out for walks,\r\nconstantly waving their rose-coloured forked tongues, and walking all\r\nsideways, so as not to set their feet on their huge bellies, like great\r\nbags, which they drag after them like trawl nets. One has to go about\r\nwith lanterns at night, for to step on these \"fetish\" gentry would\r\nexcite the population into taking the law into its own hands.\r\n\r\nDuring a visit to the English sea-captains, we heard that a French\r\nship, the Julie of Bordeaux, had just sailed in despair, without having\r\ncompleted her cargo, paid for in advance, after waiting nine months in\r\nthe river, and that Pepel, thinking that we had come on that account,\r\nwas shaking in his shoes. But on making inquiries we could find no\r\ntrace of any complaint, official or semi-official, having been made,\r\nand further, the Julie was accused of having tried to dabble in the\r\nslave trade. Here was a puzzle for us. What were we to do? Say nothing\r\nto Pepel? Then he would laugh us to scorn, for his conscience pricked\r\nhim, we knew. All his canoes had taken to flight when we arrived, and\r\nnot a single negro had boarded us. Threaten him? But with what? And\r\nwhy? To tell how we got out of this hole would be to betray... a\r\nprofessional secret. All I can say is, that the next morning, in a huge\r\nstraw hat, and with a big striped parasol in my hand, I performed the\r\nfunctions of dragoman to his Excellency Commander Lahalle, full\r\nlieutenant, representing France and the French navy.\r\n\r\nWe began by crossing a swamp, covered with huge mangrove trees, through\r\nwhich small canals had been cut to allow of the canoes getting up to\r\nthe houses. Under the dark mangrove shadows the long canoes, full of\r\nfierce-looking stark-naked blacks, looked like huge crocodiles, ready\r\nto fly at us. After a time we came alongside Pepel's house, a sort of\r\nlabyrinth of clay and straw-built huts. I announced his Excellency the\r\nCommander to a negro who spoke Spanish. We were invited to sit down, a\r\ncrowd of blacks assembled, and the elders of the tribe arrived. Lastly\r\nappeared a tall young man wearing a blue cotton shirt and trousers,\r\nwith amulets strung round his neck, and a sceptre covered with a\r\ntigerskin in his hand. This was Pepel himself. He understood English\r\nand spoke it a little. We had what is called in those parts a palaver\r\nwith him. I spoke very slowly, and the King answered me. We went over a\r\ngreat many subjects. We were severe--but just! Nothing concerning the\r\nresult of this conference ever transpired, but the diplomatic action of\r\nFrance made itself felt. Something else made itself felt as well, and\r\nthat was the horrible smell in Pepel's town, a filthy place, inhabited\r\nby a numerous and hideous population.\r\n\r\nWhen I got outside it I stopped short before a striking sight--a\r\nsemi-circular clump of trees so huge that men looked like pigmies\r\nbeneath them, giving me much the same impression as the mosque of St.\r\nSophia at Constantinople had formerly made on me. The trunks of these\r\ntrees were like the pillars of some strange cathedral, and it was as\r\ndark beneath them as in some ancient church. The bare sandy soil\r\nswarmed with women, some naked, some clothed, and all tattooed and\r\npainted and striped in various colours, scraping up the earth to find\r\nfresh water, the rarest of all commodities on the African coast. It was\r\na picture worth painting.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the Niger (which is British, irrevocably British), fierce\r\ntornadoes drove us swiftly to Fernando Po, a lovely island covered with\r\nforests, over which rises a huge peak, much like the Peak of Teneriffe,\r\nand like it too, almost always lost in the clouds. I anchored close in\r\nshore in an excellent haven, and seized the opportunity to send my crew\r\nto amuse themselves and do their washing on shore. A pretty stream,\r\nwhich tumbled in one waterfall after another through the masses of\r\ntropical growth, was soon the scene of numerous laundry operations, in\r\nwhich all the negresses in the neighbourhood insisted on joining,\r\nincited thereto no doubt by the desire of seeing how my four hundred\r\nstrapping fellows set about their work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: CITIZEN OF FERNANDO PO.]\r\n\r\nFrom the top of the hill to its foot there rose one great\r\nAfrico-European shout of laughter and shriek of delight, which it was a\r\ndownright pleasure to listen to.\r\n\r\nOfficially speaking, Fernando Po was a Spanish possession But not a\r\nsingle Spaniard lived on the island, and no Spanish flag floated over\r\nit. The English indeed had landed several cargoes of their \"liberated\r\nAfricans\" on it, and an individual, whether official or not I cannot\r\ntell, had also come to govern them. He had built himself a comfortable\r\nhouse, before which he had planted a flagstaff, from which the Union\r\nJack waved. After a time he had assumed the style and title of\r\ngovernor, and I was requested to call on him as such, which I\r\nabsolutely refused to do. On my return to Europe, chancing to meet\r\nComte Bresson, our ambassador in Spain, I mentioned the state of\r\nmatters at Fernando Po to him, and soon after received a letter from\r\nhim from Madrid, in which he told me the Spanish Government had just\r\ndespatched a warship to retake possession of the island. It was well\r\nworth while, for if the British Niger, the German Cameroons, and the\r\nFrench Gaboon are some day to develop commercially and colonially, as\r\nthey seem to give promise of doing, Fernando Po, with its insular\r\nposition, its comparatively healthy climate, and its excellent\r\nanchorage, lying as it does at an equal distance from the three centres\r\nof activity, cannot fail to become a most important place both from the\r\ncommercial and the military point of view.\r\n\r\nI speak of the FRENCH Gaboon. It was not French at the time of my\r\nvisit, but it was soon to become so. We had important commercial\r\ninterests there, and the idea of forming a colonial station was already\r\nentertained.\r\n\r\nCommander Bouet, who had preceded me on the coast, had taken his\r\ngunboat up the river, and had earnestly pressed me to do the same thing\r\nwith the Belle-Poule, so as to prove its navigability for the largest\r\nships, which, once acknowledged, would stamp it as a first-class naval\r\nstation. I resolved to make the attempt, though I had no charts, no\r\nlevels nor surveys, and the low shores offered no landmarks nor\r\ndistinctive signs, not even a tree to guide one. Bouet had merely\r\nwarned me that there were dangerous sandbanks to be avoided. \"Pooh!\r\nyou'll find your way amongst them all right.\" And so we did indeed, but\r\nit was a regular voyage of discovery.\r\n\r\nWhile we were creeping along with all due caution, a fleet of canoes\r\njoined us from the right bank of the river, where Libreville now\r\nstands, with Qua-Ben, king of the right bank, and his suite, on board.\r\nThe chief boarded us, came and greeted me, and then with a\r\nself-important air, established himself, accompanied by the whole of\r\nhis suite, on the poop of my frigate. He was a small deformed man, with\r\na countenance betraying all the spitefulness usual among dwarfs and\r\nhumpbacked people. He was huddled into a British naval officer's\r\nuniform. Taken up as I was with the management of my ship, I paid no\r\nattention at all to him. Presently a top man just come down out of the\r\nmizzentop approached me and whispered, \"Captain, that king is an awful\r\nrascal. I was here last year with a ship from Nantes, and he stripped\r\nus of everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you quite sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly, sir, it's Qua-Ben. I know him quite well\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, call the master-at-arms...Master-at-arms, take that king\r\nover there, and put him in irons!\"\r\n\r\nFour pairs of sinewy arms lifted up his sable majesty, under the orders\r\nof the master-at-arms, the police officer of the ship, and thus\r\ncarried, and followed by his dismayed attendants, the king disappeared\r\nbelow. He yelled like a dog who has had his paw trodden on, and I\r\nfancied I heard the words \"Bouet! Bouet!\" here and there. That was\r\nindeed the name he was invoking. When he had once been laid out on his\r\nplank couch, we extracted a complete confession of his misdeeds through\r\nthe medium of several interpreters, and we learnt also the fact, which\r\na summary investigation confirmed, that Commander Bouet had already\r\nchastised him and made him disgorge his plunder once. So I had him set\r\nat liberty, and advised him to meditate on his second warning, and\r\nbehave accordingly for the future.\r\n\r\nHe lost no time in taking himself off, while the Belle-Poule cast\r\nanchor near the left bank of the river, before a town belonging to\r\nanother native king known as Denis. This Denis was by no means an\r\nordinary individual. Some of his predecessors, too, had been\r\nillustrious in their way. His father, who had been kidnapped when very\r\nyoung and taken to Europe, had played the Chinese bells in a military\r\nband under the first Napoleon's empire, had returned to his own\r\ncountry, and had finally been called to the highest place in the State.\r\nHis son had inherited his father's honours. He was a fine-looking\r\nnegro, with grizzled woolly pate, who spoke French fairly well, and\r\nseemed much inclined to come to an understanding with us and open up\r\nhis country to trade and civilisation. He came to call on me in great\r\nstate, dressed in the handsome uniform of a general of the French\r\nRepublic, the cast-off garments of some performer at the Cirque\r\nOlympique. He had a tricolour plume in his hat, a gold laced coat with\r\nlapels turned back on the chest, white breeches, and top boots. He wore\r\nthe decoration of the Legion of Honour, which he had been given for\r\nsome service or other he had done our fleet in those waters; and a\r\nlarge gold medal of Queen Victoria, given him by the English, hung down\r\non a thick chain between his knees. His son--who lived close to the\r\nlanding-stage in a big hut with a hoarding round it, like what you see\r\nin Paris round pulled-down houses, on which was written, instead of the\r\nusual warning, \"Petit Denis, Fils du Roi\" (Little Denis, the King's\r\nSon) in letters a foot high--was anxious to come too. He had a Hussar\r\nuniform, but not knowing how to put it on, he sent at the last moment\r\nto ask for somebody to go and help him to get into it. I lost no time\r\nin detailing the midshipmen of the frigate for this duty, which they\r\nperformed with the greatest gusto, dressing up \"Petit Denis\" just as\r\nthe tailor's assistants dress up M. Jourdain in the Bourgeois\r\nGentil-homme. But the scamps tightened him up to such an extent in his\r\njacket and belts that he was more dead than alive, and on the brink of\r\nan apopletic attack, by the time he got on board. We gave the royal\r\nfamily the best welcome at our command. My bandmaster, M. Paulus,\r\nentertained them with his noisiest tunes; but whenever the band stopped\r\nthe king cried \"Encore! encore!\" When the bandsmen got tired out I shut\r\nhis majesty up in a little cabin with the three ship's drummers, and\r\ntold them to keep rolling till he had enough of it. But the drummers\r\ngave out in their turn, and I had to send the insatiable melomaniac and\r\nhis family on shore at last, whether he would or no.\r\n\r\nIn return for my handsome behaviour to him he invited me to join him in\r\nan elephant hunt. These animals were very numerous in the vicinity, and\r\nwere devastating the plantations. But the season was particularly\r\nunhealthy, everybody was ill; we should have had to spend the night in\r\npestilential marshes, where we were certain to get fever, and as I had\r\nhardly got clear of that we had caught in the Cazamanze River, I had to\r\nrefuse the tempting offer. We spent several days in the Gaboon, amongst\r\na race of negroes who struck me as being more intelligent and more easy\r\nto civilise than any others on the coast. The women, too, had better\r\nfeatures than most negresses. Aquiline noses were to be seen among them\r\nand lips of moderate size, and some had an almost European look. Their\r\nnecks and arms and waists were loaded with necklaces and bracelets of\r\nshells or metal, which rattled every time they moved, a somewhat idle\r\nprecaution, inspired, so it was said, by the excessive jealousy of\r\ntheir lords and masters. On the whole I carried away a very good\r\nimpression of the future possibilities of the Gaboon, both naval and\r\ncolonial.\r\n\r\nWhen the Belle-Poule had finished her cruise along the Guinea Coast she\r\nhad orders to go to Brazil; so we set sail for Rio de Janeiro. On our\r\nway thither we touched at He du Prince, a Portuguese possession\r\nentirely covered with coffee plantations, the produce of which\r\nconnoisseurs reckon to be the best in the world. Almost the whole of\r\nthe island belonged to one lady, who did all in her power to induce our\r\npurser to give up his profession and come and manage her immense\r\nproperty for her. Failing in this endeavour she sent him a keepsake, in\r\nthe shape of a pair of braces embroidered by her own fair hands, just\r\nas we were departing. We took in water at Ile du Prince, and as we had\r\nused up all our stores during our long cruise, I shipped a boat-load of\r\nyams to take the place of potatoes, and completed my victualling,\r\nduring a stay of a few hours at Ascension, by taking a large number of\r\nturtle on board. They weighed about six hundred pounds each, and did us\r\nquite well instead of fresh meat.\r\n\r\nA sudden change came over my life at Rio de Janeiro, one which my\r\nparents had long desired. I married. My bride was the second daughter\r\nof the Emperor Dom Pedro, Princess Francoise, whose acquaintance I had\r\nmade some six years previously, during my first visit to Brazil. The\r\nofficial request for the princess's hand was made in the King's name by\r\nthe Baron de Langsdorff, who was sent over as ambassador extraordinary\r\nfor that purpose in the Ville de Marseilles. The wedding was celebrated\r\nat the San Cristofero Palace, and a few days afterwards we started for\r\nBrest, which place we reached after a slow passage of seventy-two days\r\nagainst contrary winds.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival I had to give up the command of the Belle-Poule, and I\r\ndid not part from the old ship, which had carried me so well and safely\r\nthrough so many adventures, without a pang of emotion. I felt, when I\r\nclasped my officers' hands in hearty farewell, that I was sure (THEN,\r\nat least) of meeting them again in the course of my professional\r\ncareer. The painful leave-taking was when I had to say good-bye to my\r\nbrave crew, a happy family, in which discipline had been so strictly\r\nestablished from the very outset of the voyage, that punishment had\r\nbecome unknown, and whose universal sense of duty had engendered that\r\nmutual affection between officers and men which is the foundation of\r\ntrue professional zeal and self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe fine body of fighting men which four years of care and unvaryingly\r\nconsistent management had brought to the highest pitch of perfection,\r\nall the brave fellows of whom I felt I could ask anything and be\r\ncertain it would be performed, were to be scattered, every man to his\r\nown home. I was never to see them again, except a few, one here and one\r\nthere. Nowadays even, after the lapse of fifty years, if chance takes\r\nme anywhere upon the seacoast, I sometimes see some old sailor's eye\r\nfixed on me, altered as I am, as though he were searching the far\r\ndepths of his memory. All at once one hand goes up to his cap, and the\r\nother is stretched out to me with a friendly look, and the words \"Do\r\nyou remember such a one, topman of the maintop--such a storm--such an\r\nescape?\"\r\n\r\nThen my heart swells, and I say to myself, as I could go on saying for\r\never, \"There is nothing you cannot do with Frenchmen when they are once\r\nsaturated with the spirit of obedience, discipline, and duty!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER  XI\r\n\r\n1844\r\n\r\n\r\nI had hardly got back to Paris when I was shot on to the Admiralty\r\nBoard. A great honour it was, no doubt, for a junior like myself to be\r\nassociated with such veterans in the profession as numbers among its\r\nmembers were. But this gathering of experienced men was merely a body\r\nof advisers placed at the disposal of the Minister of Marine, to assist\r\nhim with its counsel on any questions he chose to submit to them. The\r\ncommittee possessed no initiative of its own, and I felt myself\r\nmisplaced upon it. I had indeed, and always have preserved, the deepest\r\nrespect for its eminent qualities. It has contributed not a little, by\r\nits consistent action and permanent character, to the preservation of\r\nour naval organisation--the worth of which has been proved everywhere,\r\nin the Crimea, on the battlefields in 1870, in Tunis, and in\r\nChina--from the results of the conceited ignorance of mushroom\r\npoliticians. But in the year 1843 we were on the brink of the\r\ninevitable revolution worked in naval matters by the introduction of\r\nsteam. The great object for us was to create, and that rapidly, under\r\npain of being outstripped by others, a new naval force, more\r\nappropriate, perhaps, than our former one, to our national genius and\r\nresources. Passionately interested as I was in the greatness of my\r\ncountry, having leisure time to dispose of, since nothing called on me\r\nto plunge into the paltry bargain-making of electoral politics in which\r\nthat country was wallowing, having no love of red tape nor excess of\r\nexperience to hold me back, I was ardently anxious to be employed where\r\nI could actively assist in creating a powerful element in the national\r\nstrength. I therefore merely passed through the Admiralty Board.\r\n\r\nMy only recollection of it is of having been present at some very long\r\nsittings in a room in the Ministry of Marine, the windows of which look\r\non to the Rue Royale, which apartment one of my colleagues, Admiral de\r\nBougainville, had turned into a sort of stovehouse by means of hot-air\r\npipes, sandbags, screens, and foot muffs. We all nearly died of the\r\nheat, and when another colleague of mine, Baron Charles Dupin, made us\r\nlong speeches, I had the greatest difficulty in keeping myself awake.\r\n\r\nThe Minister of Marine decided, at my entreaty, to appoint a special\r\nnaval commission on steam, of which I was a member. The chief\r\ncommission did nothing, or scarcely anything--but a sub-commission did\r\ngood work. There were five of us--a captain in the navy, M. de Verninac\r\n(who was afterwards Minister of Marine under General Cavaignac); a very\r\nclever engineer, formerly Superintendent at Indret, M. Rossin; an\r\nartillery colonel, M. Durbec; M. Touchard, a naval lieutenant; and\r\nmyself. I will not give the full story of our work, and of the constant\r\nbattle we had to fight with obstinate habit and dread of\r\nresponsibility. All those early attempts of ours at transforming our\r\nnavy seem almost childish, looked at from the distance of the\r\nhalf-century which has since elapsed. And indeed, though my\r\nrecollection of them is clear enough, I have no means of verifying it,\r\nall my notes and reports, and all my correspondence relating to the\r\nundertakings in question, having passed out of my hands, in the\r\nfollowing manner:--\r\n\r\nSome months after the Revolution in 1848, while I was residing in\r\nEngland, at Claremont, a visitor's name was brought up to me. The name,\r\nde X., was that of a good family, well known in Normandy and in the\r\npolitical and scientific world. But instead of one of the faces I was\r\nprepared to see, I beheld that of a most unsatisfactory member of the\r\nfamily, whom I instantly remembered having seen in Algeria, wearing a\r\nBelgian uniform, and acting as reporter for the Constitutionnel\r\nnewspaper. He entered the room and said:\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've just arrived from your part of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"After the Tuileries were captured, on February 24th (you were in\r\nAlgiers just then), I took up my quarters in your rooms. They are very\r\ncomfortable rooms. I stayed in them for two months. They were rather\r\nupside down, as you may fancy. Everything worth taking had been carried\r\noff, but the floor was littered with books and papers and a whole heap\r\nof things that everybody had trodden upon. I amused myself by settling\r\nthem all up, especially your letters and papers, which I sorted. I\r\narranged them into several classes. Everything referring to your\r\nmissions and to political matters I sent to the Ministry of Foreign\r\nAffairs, and everything touching the navy to the Ministry of Marine. In\r\nfact, I disposed of everything. But I put aside a few documents\r\nregarding the Princesse de Joinville's business matters in Brazil and\r\nyour own private journals of your sea-voyages, and brought them with me\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nHe smilingly showed me a packet he held in his hand, then went on:\r\n\r\n\"But my journey has cost me a lot of money.\" \"Then say how much you\r\nwant, in plain English.\"\r\n\r\n\"A hundred louis.\"\r\n\r\nI went and fetched the money, and then showed him the door without\r\nanother word, though I could hardly resist kicking him through it. Thus\r\nit was that I learnt what had become of my papers on naval subjects. I\r\ngreatly regretted the loss of my private correspondence, and more\r\nespecially that of my letters from M. Dupuy de Lome, a most talented\r\nyoung engineer, much in advance of his times, with whom I had been in\r\ndaily intercourse.\r\n\r\nOur commission did its best. It made a modest beginning by altering the\r\nfighting armament of our existing ships, placing their guns fore and\r\naft, so as to permit of their developing their artillery power to the\r\nutmost possible extent, while at the same time exposing the propelling\r\nmachinery to as little danger as possible. We turned out ships of\r\nvarious types, such as the Descartes, the Cuvier, the Pluton, &c. Then\r\ncame the turn of the fabric of the ships themselves, and we had a\r\nseries of experiments made on the practising ground at Gavres, near\r\nLorient, to test the penetration of projectiles on every sort of\r\nsubstance--wood, coal, gutta-percha, iron plates, and finally on iron\r\nplates superimposed one on the other--in other words armour-plating. It\r\nwas ten years before the armour plating was actually brought into use,\r\nso great was the delay caused by political agitation in the country.\r\n\r\nAt Lorient, too, M. Labrousse, a post-captain in the navy, made\r\nexperiments to find out the best form to give to the rams of warships,\r\nwhile a literary man, M. Jal by name, was hunting all the old books and\r\narchives for everything touching the manoeuvres and tactics of ancient\r\nrowing ships and galleys.\r\n\r\nThen from paddle-ships we passed on to those with propellers which were\r\nsubmerged, and therefore much more easy to protect, and I went to watch\r\nthe first trials of the newly-invented improvements at sea--that of our\r\nfirst screw-ship, the Napoleon, a name which was afterwards exchanged\r\nfor that of Corse, under which she served as a despatch-boat for over\r\nforty years--of our first ironclad, a screw-ship, too, the Chaptal,\r\nbuilt at Asnieres by M. Cave--and of the Pomone, the first frigate we\r\nbuilt with auxiliary engines, which was fitted with a screw-propeller\r\ndesigned by a Swedish engineer, Mr. Erickson. But the most interesting\r\nof all these trials was that of the Napoleon, first, because, as I have\r\nalready stated, she was our first screwship, and also because that\r\nparticular mode of propulsion is of French invention.\r\n\r\nAn organ-builder at Amiens, of the name of Dallery, was the first\r\nperson to think (in 1803) of building a boat driven by a screw. He\r\nruined himself over it, and broke up all his machinery in his despair.\r\nThe idea was taken up again later by M. Sauvage, a shipbuilder, who\r\nmade some progress with it. I had known Sauvage, in 1835, in connection\r\nwith another invention called a physionotype, by means of which a\r\nmathematically correct impression could be taken of the features of any\r\nface. But as everybody made an appalling grimace before putting their\r\nface into the instrument, the result, though strictly exact, was\r\nmonstrously ugly.\r\n\r\nThere was more future promise about Sauvage's work on the\r\nscrew-propeller than about his physionotype, but he himself did not\r\nreap the benefit accruing from it. It became public property. The\r\nEnglish built a trial ship, the Rattler, and the Americans another, the\r\nPrinceton. But the Napoleon was earlier than these, and besides was\r\nmore successful than either of them. She was originally ordered as a\r\nmail steam-packet, from a private shipyard, by the Ministry of Finance,\r\nwhich was much bolder as to introducing innovations than the Ministry\r\nof Marine, and her construction was confided to two eminent men--M.\r\nNormand, of Havre, for her hull, and an Englishman, Mr. Barnes, for her\r\nengines and propeller. Each of these gentlemen was equally successful\r\nin his first attempt.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1843 I was in command of a flotilla, formed for\r\nthe purpose of making experiments to compare ships of the old-fashioned\r\ntype with this little vessel, which we tested in every imaginable way.\r\nAt every change in the condition of the sea, M. Normand, Mr. Barnes,\r\nand I myself, who were all three of us escorting the Napoleon on board\r\nthe Pluton, used to rush on deck to watch her behaviour. M. Normand\r\nwould give us a lecture on her lines and her displacement wave, or the\r\ndegree of her rolling or her pitching. Mr. Barnes, a great big\r\nEnglishman, said never a word, but pulled a slide-rule out of his\r\npocket and mumbled algebraic formulae. The ship was commanded in\r\nfirst-rate style by a very efficient naval lieutenant, M. de\r\nMontaignac, who since that time has acted as Minister for Marine\r\nAffairs.\r\n\r\nAs nobody had ever seen a screw steamer before, we aroused general\r\nastonishment wherever we went. In the course of our cruise we entered\r\nthe Thames, and ascended the Medway from Sheerness to Chatham. It was\r\nin the morning, there was a slight fog. The authorities were informed\r\nof our approach, and were preparing to receive us, only delaying\r\nassembling for that purpose till they had been warned the ship was\r\nclose by, either by her being caught sight of, or by the sound of her\r\npaddle-wheels striking the water. But the Napoleon, running swiftly up\r\nthrough the fog, making no noise whatever with her screw, took them all\r\nby surprise. When the dockyard authorities hurried up they saw her\r\nstop, and then, thanks to her screw, she turned almost in her own\r\nlength, and brought up alongside the jetty--a novel proceeding over\r\nwhich the commodore, an old salt, was still gasping when I went ashore.\r\n\r\nDuring this visit to the Thames the little flotilla went up to\r\nWoolwich, where we were welcomed by the English authorities with that\r\nfrank cordiality with which they have almost always received me. We\r\nwere shown both the arsenal and the dockyard. In the dockyard basin a\r\nsteam corvette with paddle-wheels was lying, which had a new\r\narrangement of which I had heard a great deal. The sponsons formed\r\ngreat rafts which could be lowered into the water by an ingenious\r\nmechanical contrivance, and which, in case of its being necessary to\r\nland troops, would carry a large number at a time, and even save the\r\ncrew in a case of disaster. This, indeed, did occur in the Crimea and\r\nelsewhere, after our ships had all been equipped with the invention.\r\n\r\nCommodore Sir Frederick Collier was good enough to have these rafts\r\nexperimented with at my request. I turned my opportunity of seeing them\r\nto good account. When I was back in Paris, some two or three months\r\nlater, the English naval captain (his name escapes me, I fancy it was\r\nSmith), who had invented this raft system, asked me to receive him. He\r\ncame, so he told me, to offer his plan to the French navy, and on the\r\nstrength of the interest with which I had followed the trial of his\r\nboat at Woolwich, he begged me to recommend it to the minister for that\r\ndepartment of affairs. Further, he offered to bring me a model of it.\r\n\r\n\"Wait one moment,\" I replied.\r\n\r\nI rang the bell, and sent for an old workman who was in my employment.\r\nHe came, with a model of my visitor's boat and lowering apparatus in\r\nhis hand, constructed on drawings I had made on my return from England.\r\nThe inventor stood as though petrified at the sight. The only word he\r\nsaid was \"Wonderful!\" It appears I had caught the likeness at once.\r\nWhat it is to know how to draw!\r\n\r\nLet me add, by the way, that the old workman to whom I have just\r\nreferred had been a ship's carpenter with the fleet commanded by\r\nVillaret de Joyeuse in the naval engagement which we call the Battle of\r\nthe 13th Prairial, and the English that of the 1st of June. At my house\r\nhe often met an academician, as old as himself, of the name of Dupaty,\r\nwho had also been a sailor, and present at the same battle. The two old\r\nwarriors would interchange recollections, which amused me much, and\r\noften interested me deeply as well.\r\n\r\nFrom them I learnt that before the fleet sailed from Brest to fight the\r\nBritish it was \"purified\" (epuree). The captain and two lieutenants of\r\nthe flag-ship, the Cote d'Or, were guillotined, and the ship's name\r\nchanged into the terrifying one of the Montagne. The captain of another\r\nship, the Jean Bart, had also been beheaded. Thousands of sailors and\r\nseasoned marines, whose opinions were not trusted, were drafted into\r\nthe land-forces, and replaced by others who were pure Republicans, but\r\nwho did not know their work. POUR ENCOURAGER LES AUTRES, Jean Bon St.\r\nAndre, commissary of the republic with the fleet, and afterwards\r\nprefect of Mayence under Napoleon (his very name marked him out for the\r\npost!), had caused a guillotine to be erected on board every ship. It\r\nwas set up forward at the foot of the foremast. Yet all these\r\nterrorising measures and this revolutionary disorganisation did not\r\nbring us victory. They brought indeed nothing but defeat, attended by\r\ndownright carnage. The valour of our crews often amounted to actual\r\nheroism. But they had no skill. They were killed, but they could not\r\ndeal death themselves. Every English shot told. Every French one flew\r\nwide. It is most distressing, on consulting the annals of the two\r\nnavies, to notice the enormous losses on board the French ships\r\ncompared with the insignificant number of men killed or wounded on the\r\nEnglish ones. True it is, that at sea, just as on dry land,\r\nextemporised arrangements are disastrous things, and that, as I have\r\nalready asserted, nothing can ever replace professional skill and the\r\nlong established habit of obedience to superior orders and general\r\ndiscipline.\r\n\r\nThat wonderfully dramatic, if sometimes contested episode, of the\r\nVengeur going down into the waves with all her crew, sooner than\r\nsurrender, is supposed to have taken place at the close of the battle\r\nof the 13th Prairial. I have often heard the story attributed to\r\nBarrere, who, being obliged to give an account of the lost battle to\r\nthe Convention, endeavoured thus to gild the pill. I questioned my two\r\nold sailor friends eagerly concerning this incident of the struggle\r\nwherein they had both played their part.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion I made personal inquiries of one of the last\r\nsurvivors of the Vengeur, to whom I had been commissioned to convey the\r\nCross of the Legion of Honour. Putting together what I gathered from\r\nthese various individuals, and what I collected elsewhere, I believe\r\nthe exact truth concerning the episode in question to be as follows:\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the fight, after having grappled for a long time, at\r\nclose quarters, with the British warship the Brunswick, the Vengeur,\r\nriddled with shot on every side, and utterly dismasted, was shipping\r\nwater through her ports with every roll of the sea. In this condition\r\nshe must have sunk before long. The engagement was over--it was six\r\no'clock at night. The English warships Alfred and Culloden, and the\r\nRattler, cutter, came to the Vengeur's assistance, and set to work,\r\nwith the few of their boats which had not been smashed during the\r\nfight, to save Renaudin, her plucky captain, and his son, first of all,\r\nand then take off the crew. The Alfred took off two hundred and\r\nthirteen men, the Culloden and Rattler almost as many more; but the\r\nwork of rescue was still going on when the ship foundered, carrying\r\nwith her not only all the most seriously wounded men, but about forty\r\nunwounded sailors, who seeing death was inevitable, bravely greeted its\r\napproach with shouts of \"Vive la Nation! Vive la Republique!\" The story\r\nis such a splendid one as it is, that it needs no imaginary\r\nembellishments whatever.\r\n\r\nLet me return for a moment to my excellent academician friend, M.\r\nDupaty, whose acquaintance I had made in the most absurd fashion. In\r\nthe palmy days of the warlike enthusiasm of the Citizen Guard the\r\nworthy Dupaty was a captain in the 1st battalion of the 2nd Legion,\r\ncommanded by Commandant Talabot. One evening, when he was on guard at\r\nthe Palais Royal, he had been reciting some verses in my father's\r\ndrawing-room, and, somewhat intoxicated perhaps by poetic enthusiasm,\r\nhe begged the King to put one of his sons into his company. His Majesty\r\nburst out laughing and said:\r\n\r\n\"There's Joinville, he knows all his rifle-drill very well; he has had\r\none of the old Invalides to teach him. He'll do for you.\"\r\n\r\nSo I was put into a National Guard's uniform, with a knapsack stuffed\r\nwith hay on my back (in the ardour of that moment the chic companies\r\nall wore knapsacks), and was sent to drill with my company on the Rue\r\nde Londres drill ground, where the Quartier de l'Europe now stands. A\r\nmore ridiculous proceeding cannot be imagined, but old Dupaty was\r\nperfectly enchanted. He was still more delighted when he succeeded in\r\ngetting one of his works, a comic opera called Picaros et Diego given\r\nat the theatre in the Chateau of Compiegne, in honour of the marriage\r\nof my sister Louise and the King of the Belgians. But lo! at the climax\r\nof the piece, the principal performer came forward, before the newly\r\nmarried couple, the Royalties, and all the great personages forming the\r\naudience, and burst forth with a gag couplet, which nobody expected.\r\n\r\n Oui, c'en est fait, je me marie,\r\n Je veux vivre comme un Caton.\r\n Il fut en temps pour la folie\r\n Il en est un pour la raison!\r\n [Footnote: Rough translation:--\r\n Yes! all is o'er, I'm going to wed,\r\n Like Cato I'm resolved to live.\r\n The time for youthful folly's sped,\r\n My life to Reason now I'll give!]\r\n\r\nAs King Leopold was not reckoned to have led a life quite devoid of\r\nlove affairs, the appropriateness of the remark had a wonderful effect.\r\nAll the grandees hung their heads in a row, and the rest of the\r\naudience struggled with a violent desire to burst out laughing.\r\n\r\nBut this long digression has carried me far away. I must get back to\r\nEngland and my little flotilla's stay there. My brother Aumale, who had\r\naccompanied me on my cruise, went with me to Windsor, where we paid our\r\nrespects to Queen Victoria. Although in the course of my various\r\nvoyages I had touched at several English ports, this was the first time\r\nI really saw England, hospitable England, and the first impression it\r\nmade on me was very deep. Though the gray and smoky tint of both sky\r\nand water and buildings, and everything I passed as I went up the\r\nThames to London Bridge, looked singularly dreary to my eyes, the\r\nimmense commercial stir and general activity I saw exceeded anything I\r\nhad ever expected to behold. And the ineffaceable impression of this\r\ngreatness and power was quickly succeeded by another, no less profound,\r\nand which my long life has only confirmed, that here was a nation which\r\nhad known how to pass through a revolution without permitting it to\r\nencroach on its social discipline, nor allowing democratic jealousies\r\nto destroy its traditions and sow discord between the different classes\r\nof its population.\r\n\r\nI thought Windsor quite superb. The old castle, surrounded by its\r\nancient trees, with its foundations lapped by the waters of the Thames,\r\nthe national river, and seeming to stretch out its protecting arm over\r\nEton and the picturesque college--whither the flower of the nation\r\ncomes to receive the healthiest and soundest of educations at the hands\r\nof a purely clerical body--is a true symbol of the calm strength and\r\nsteady permanence of the English Monarchy.\r\n\r\nI had met Prince Albert several times already, in Paris; but I had\r\nnever seen Queen Victoria before. Bright and witty, with an arch and\r\npleasant smile not always quite devoid of mischief, the young sovereign\r\nwas in all the freshness and brilliance of her youth and the radiance\r\nof her happiness. She and her royal husband gave us a welcome of which\r\nI preserve the most grateful recollection, and from that day forward I\r\nconceived a profoundly respectful affection for her Majesty, which has\r\nincreased with my advancing years.\r\n\r\nOur visit to Windsor was short and devoid of striking incident, beyond\r\nthe acquaintance I made there with men of eminence in war or state\r\ncraft, such as the Duke of Wellington, Sir Robert Peel, and Lord\r\nAberdeen. It was at this time that the Queen of Great Britain's journey\r\nto the Chateau d'Eu was decided on. I went with my flotilla as far as\r\nCherbourg to meet her.\r\n\r\nWhen she got there, she invited me on board her own vessel, the\r\nsplendid yacht Osborne, commanded by a son of the late King William\r\nIV., Lord Adolphus Fitzclarence, a very good fellow, but a somewhat\r\nrubicund specimen of the old-fashioned British sailor, with an eye he\r\nhad some difficulty in keeping open; which failing earned him the\r\nfollowing reply to his chaffing remark, made to a little schoolboy,\r\nalready somewhat sensitive about his personal dignity. \"Oh, WHAT a bad\r\nhat you have!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, what a damned bad eye!\"\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, was also on board the\r\nyacht, besides Lord Liverpool, Lord Charles Wellesley, Colonel Wylde,\r\nand the ladies-in-waiting--that charming Lady Canning whom we had known\r\nin Paris as a child, and who died in India, after having shown great\r\ncourage during the terrible Sepoy mutiny, and a not less charming Miss\r\nLiddell, who afterwards became Lady Bloomfield.\r\n\r\nThe Queen's entrance into Treport was favoured by splendid weather; the\r\nlittle wet dock, crammed with fishing boats, and the old church, were\r\ngilded by the rays of the setting sun, while opposite us, on the rock\r\noverlooking the port, rose the great cross before which the fishermen's\r\nwives go and pray in stormy weather. We went ashore to the firing of\r\ncannon and the rattle of thousands of sabots on the shingle, among a\r\ngood-humoured crowd of sailors, short-petticoated fishwives, and\r\nwhite-capped Normandy peasant women, all making their comments aloud,\r\nwhile here and there appeared a gendarme's cocked hat, or the\r\nbroad-brimmed headgear of some country cure. It was a picturesque\r\nsight, so gay and noisy, and so thoroughly French, and the young\r\nsovereign seemed delighted with its novelty. There was no cavalry\r\nescort nor lining of the road from Treport with troops; but the\r\nsplendid squadrons of the 1st Cuirassiers, in their copper\r\nbreast-plates, were drawn up in echelon at regular distances apart in\r\nthe open fields, and saluted with their trumpets as we went by; while\r\nat the chateau itself the Guard of Honour was furnished by a battalion\r\nof riflemen drawn up in close order, their dark uniform and military\r\nair causing Lord Charles Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington's son, and a\r\nthoroughbred soldier himself, to exclaim, \"Oh, what splendid little\r\nfellows!\"\r\n\r\nMy father had put the Queen into a huge open vehicle, with room for\r\ntwelve people in it, like a boat in shape, drawn by a team of eight\r\nhorses, harnessed in the French style, with an outrider, coachman,\r\nfootmen, and grooms all dressed in red. The postilion, who wore great\r\nboots as in a Van der Meulen picture, was the only servant in a blue\r\nlivery. This contrast in colour arose out of a tradition which had been\r\nkept up in the royal stables, that the postilion, being supposed to\r\nhave taken off his jacket for the sake of being cool, must always be\r\ndressed in the same colours as the other servants' waistcoats. The\r\nOrleans livery being scarlet with a blue waistcoat, the postilions wore\r\nblue. The Conde livery being chamois-colour, with amaranth waistcoats,\r\nthe postilions must wear amaranth, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe royal waggon with its eight horses was anything but easy to manage\r\non the narrow Norman roads. And one slight accident occurred of which I\r\nwas the unlucky cause. I was riding beside the carriage door, and I got\r\nin the way when it was turning a corner, so that it got locked, and\r\nremained so for some minutes. My father stormed, and the Queen went\r\ninto a fit of laughter; but the poor old coachman, a veteran belonging\r\nto the old state stables, cast a look at me that must have been like\r\nVatel's glance before he ran himself through with his sword. I had\r\nbrought disgrace on him at the most solemn moment in his life!\r\n\r\nThe next day a fresh bit of local colour was provided for the royal\r\nguests. The Queen was taken out driving with posters in the forest. The\r\npostilions, with their clubbed and powdered hair and gaily beribboned\r\nhats, started at a fairly steady pace, but once they were clear of the\r\ncrowd they went off at full tear, with loose reins and a great cracking\r\nof whips. The pace was so severe that it was as much as I could do,\r\nwith my horse at full gallop, to keep my place beside the carriage\r\ndoor. The fun was flavoured with a touch of uneasiness, which increased\r\nits charm. The whole period of the Queen's visit was thus spent in\r\ndrives and excursions, from which we did our best to banish any touch\r\nof official formality and constraint.\r\n\r\nIn the evenings there would be a concert, with the artists from the\r\nConservatoire to sing the chorus from Armide, \"Jamais en ces beaux\r\nlieux,\" the orchestra performing the symphony in A, and a solo on the\r\nhorn by Vivier; or else Auber would bring the Opera Comique troupe,\r\nRoger, Chollet, and Anna Thillon; or else Arnot played L'Humonste with\r\nMdme. Doche. There were Cabinet Ministers there as well. Lord Aberdeen\r\nand M. Guizot held conversations, during which they may or may not have\r\nconfided political secrets to each other. Marshal Soult, the President\r\nof the Council, spoke but little, and when he did, the words that fell\r\nfrom his lips were not always of the most good-tempered sort, as one\r\nunlucky general found out to his cost. This worthy man, no longer\r\nyoung, who was in command in a neighbouring department, held the grade\r\nof brigadier-general, and, feeling the moment of his retirement was\r\napproaching, he was passionately anxious, before it struck, to make\r\nsure of the three stars that mark the rank of lieutenant-general. He\r\nhad been watching his opportunity to try and get the marshal to look\r\nfavourably on his request, and he fancied he had found it one morning\r\nwhen he met him after luncheon, at the entrance of the Galerie des\r\nGuise. The marshal was walking along, limping from an old wound, with\r\none hand behind his back, and plunged in a meditation which was the\r\nreverse of rose-colour, to judge by the pouting under-lip, which he\r\nalways wore when this was the case.\r\n\r\nThe general approached him, and he stopped short, knitting his brows.\r\n\r\n\"I am very lucky, Monsieur le Marechal, to have this opportunity of\r\npaying you my respects.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooh!\" said the marshal, but the poor wretch went on:\r\n\r\n\"And as I have this lucky chance, Monsieur le Marechal, I take\r\nadvantage of it to inform you of the satisfactory state of the public\r\nmind in my department, and the good results of my work there. Do you\r\nknow that only the day before yesterday I had sitting at my own dinner\r\ntable, with several people who are devoted to the present order of\r\nthings, a Legitimist and ... a Republican!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, had you indeed? Then let me tell you you asked them to dine to\r\nmeet an idiot!\"\r\n\r\nAnd off the marshal went, leaving his unlucky interlocutor aghast at\r\nthe sudden collapse of his hopes. I have even heard it said he died of\r\nit!\r\n\r\nOn her return from Eu, the Queen landed at Brighton, whither I had the\r\nhonour of accompanying her, and where she was received with that\r\ngeneral enthusiasm which has never failed to greet her. I remained for\r\na day as her Majesty's guest in that hideous Pavilion at Brighton, in\r\nthose days a royal residence, where nobody could move about or open a\r\nwindow without being exposed to the fire of all the opera glasses in\r\nthe houses opposite This masterpiece of bad taste has been turned into\r\na casino. It is the one thing it was fitted to be. Then I took those of\r\nour ships which had escorted the Queen to Brighton back to Treport to\r\nact as guardships while the King remained at Eu.\r\n\r\nSome years previously a comical scene took place on board one of these\r\nguardships. The King had gone, according to his usual custom, to\r\ninspect the ship in question and her crew, accompanied by the then\r\nMinister for Marine Affairs, a gallant officer who shall be nameless,\r\nbut who was better fitted for giving words of command than for\r\nextemporising speeches. Once on board the... Pelican (I will use that\r\nname, though it is not the real one), and the inspection of the crew\r\nbeing over, the King told the minister he desired to commemorate his\r\nvisit by the bestowal of at least one Cross of Honour. The idea was\r\nquite unexpected, but after some consideration it was decided to give\r\nthe decoration to the surgeon-major, who had behaved with great\r\ndevotion during a recent cholera epidemic. The crew was still\r\nassembled, the King took up his position aft, but the minister, being\r\nperfectly ignorant as to the course the ceremony should take, did not\r\nopen his lips. So the scene opened thus:\r\n\r\n\"Come, Admiral!\" said the King. \"Tell the drummer to ouvrir le ban.\"\r\n\r\nThe admiral in stentorian tones: \"Drummer! Ouvrez le ban!\"\r\n\r\nA silence. Then the King in a whisper: \"Say something, Admiral! Tell\r\nthem I am going to decorate an officer.\"\r\n\r\nThe admiral made a sign of acquiescence, stepped forward, and began\r\nagain, in the same stentorian tones:\r\n\r\n\"Officers and men of the Pelican!\"--another pause \"His\r\nMajesty\"--another pause--\"The cholera!\"--yet another pause. \"Your\r\ngallant surgeon,\" pointing to him, \"your gallant surgeon, I say. The\r\nKing desires to reward the officers and men of the Pelican for the\r\ncholera!\" (He fired off the word cholera like a cannon shot.) \"Appoints\r\nyou Legionary\" (\"Knight,\" whispers the King very low). \"Yes, Knight\r\nLegionary\" (the King bent his head in despair). \"Knight Legionary of\r\nhis Majesty's r-r-royal order of the Legion of Honour! Drummer! Fermez\r\nle ban!\"\r\n\r\nThis was done by the only drummer on board; the gallant surgeon-major\r\ncame up to receive his cross, which the King, whose gravity never\r\nforsook him, presented to him with a few kindly words, while all the\r\nspectators made superhuman efforts to control their inclination to\r\nlaugh. What dozens of scenes of that kind I have witnessed!\r\n\r\nI wound up my term of service at Eu. All there were still full of the\r\nQueen of England's visit, the episodes of which Isabey, Eugene Lamy,\r\nAlaux, and Simeon Fort were very busy transferring to canvas. At last\r\nmy little naval division was paid off. I went back to Paris and\r\nre-entered the world, not of politics, but of social intercourse. I\r\neven went to Chantilly Races, a meeting which my brothers had just\r\nestablished, and which has now become a standing institution. These\r\nraces were very different when they first began to what they are in the\r\npresent day. There was the same beautiful turfy racecourse, opposite\r\nthe ancient castle of the Condes; the horses, too, and the trainers and\r\njockeys were much the same; but the general public was very different.\r\nThere were no railways then to bring huge crowds in numberless specials\r\nand return them to Paris the same evening. The company was less\r\nnumerous, but it was more select. People migrated to Chantilly for the\r\nrace-week, content with what lodging they could find, and ready to put\r\nup with all the inconveniences of a sort of huge picnic, and spend\r\nevery hour both of the day and night amusing themselves as best they\r\ncould. It was a kind of summer carnival, with country excursions,\r\ndinners, balls, and merry-makings of every description, at which the\r\ngreat world and the demi-monde, both of them in considerable force,\r\nsometimes mingled in somewhat noisy fun.\r\n\r\nI recollect one extra riotous ball, at which the worthy mayor of\r\nChantilly, M. Jaquin, thought it his duty to interfere, with the\r\ngendarmerie, to restore order. The worthy magistrate entered, and\r\ncommanded the noise to be stopped in the name of the law, at the same\r\ntime inquiring who was the proprietor of the house. \"Brochet is!\"\r\nchorused a hundred voices.\r\n\r\nNow Brochet was the surname of a certain fascinating cocotte. \"Well,\"\r\nsaid the good mayor paternally, \"I should like to speak to M. Brochet.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's me!\" shouted the same hundred individuals at once. Then there\r\nwas a shout of \"Long live Jaquin!\" and the worthy man was carried round\r\nin triumph, while the fair ladies hastened to exert their blandishments\r\nupon the gendarmes. How could anybody be angry? The representatives of\r\nlaw and order fraternised with those of--the other thing! and it all\r\nended in smoke!\r\n\r\nSo much for our evenings. In the daytime there was hunting. Everybody\r\nfollowed in merry parties, on horseback, in carriages, or on foot, to\r\nthe sound of the horns of the red coated piqueurs of the Orleans family\r\nhunt. The whole thing was full of \"go,\" and I remember seeing one very\r\npretty woman, out of patience with the slowness of her carriage,\r\nentreat a friend to lend her his horse, and start off on it astride,\r\nnot in her riding habit, but in ordinary outdoor costume. The fair\r\nlady's name was Lola Montes, and she later on attained some\r\nconsiderable celebrity in the kingdom of Bavaria.\r\n\r\nAfter this fashion the lovely month of May was spent. But June brought\r\nme more serious occupation. I was appointed to the command of a\r\nsquadron ordered to the coasts of the Empire of Morocco, where we were\r\non the brink of important events, affecting alike the consolidation of\r\nour Algerian conquests and our relations with other Great Powers Driven\r\nto extremity by the blow given to his prestige by the capture of his\r\nsmalah, Abd-el-Kadir was playing a last and desperate card. He had once\r\nmore kindled all the Mussulman fanaticism and hatred of the foreign\r\ninvader against us We had to fight in every direction. While my brother\r\nAumale had several sharp engagements, in one of which my younger\r\nbrother, Montpensier, was wounded, on the Constantine side of the\r\ncountry, General Bugeaud was carrying on a daily struggle with the\r\nwarlike tribes of the Province of Oran. These tribes, whenever they\r\nwere repulsed, crossed the River Moulouia, which was the frontier line\r\nof Morocco, at which our troops had to stop short on account of\r\nEuropean susceptibilities, and thus escaped all chastisement.\r\n\r\nThe enemy concluded, from the cessation of our pursuit, either that we\r\ndid not dare to brave the displeasure of the Emperor of Morocco, or\r\nelse that the European Powers, and especially the Power whose flag\r\nfloated over Gibraltar, protected the soil of that empire from any\r\nviolation. It thus became a sort of citadel, whence any attempt on us\r\nmight safely be made without fear of reprisals. There were consequently\r\nperpetual irruptions into our territory, not only of the fanatic\r\nMoorish element, but, covertly, of the Emperor of Morocco's own troops,\r\nwhom he had massed, on pretence of keeping watch, close to our\r\nfrontier, and in the long run these attacks, which had to be\r\nceaselessly repulsed at the cost of precious lives, had grown\r\nintolerable. This state of things could not go on The French Government\r\nresolved to put an end to it, and its first step was to despatch the\r\nsquadron I had the honour to command. I was to call on the Emperor of\r\nMorocco to withdraw the protection he had given Abdel-Kadir up to that\r\nperiod; not to allow our enemies to organise expeditions against us on\r\nhis territory; and, finally, to reduce the considerable collection of\r\ntroops he had amassed on the frontier--the number and attitude of which\r\nboth amounted to a threat--to a mere police force. Failing his prompt\r\nacquiescence with my demands, I was to use force at sea, in concert\r\nwith General Bugeaud on land, to force Muley Abderrahman to submit.\r\n\r\nBut I had been expressly desired to carry forbearance to its furthest\r\npossible limit, and in case of our being obliged to take action to let\r\nit be known in the most public manner that we had no idea of conquest.\r\nAbove all, I was carefully to avoid anything that might possibly wound\r\ninternational feelings. And herein lay the difficulty of my task, for\r\nthese same feelings were excessively tender. I need hardly say that\r\nthis was especially so in the case of England. We had driven away her\r\ntrade when we conquered Algeria, and she did not want her commercial\r\nrelations with Morocco to meet the same fate. Gibraltar, being in a\r\nstate of perpetual semi-blockade on the Spanish side, is obliged to\r\ndraw all the necessary supplies for its huge garrison and its smuggling\r\npopulation from Morocco; and this has gone on for such a length of time\r\nthat Englishmen have got into the habit of looking on Tangier as being\r\nan indispensable dependency belonging to that proud citadel on the\r\nRock, which keeps watch and ward over the gates of the Mediterranean.\r\nAdd to this a certain national feeling among the English that the sea\r\nis their special domain, and their consequent jealousy whenever naval\r\naction is taken by any other fleet than theirs, and some idea of the\r\ninflammable elements with which I was about to be surrounded will be\r\ngained. The very announcement of the despatch of my squadron to Morocco\r\nbrought forth a demonstration of the national sensitiveness in the\r\nBritish Parliament. A former minister, Lord Minto, was the first to\r\necho it in the House of Lords, where he went so far as to do me the\r\nhonour of complaining that _I_ should have been entrusted with the\r\ncommand of the squadron It was decided that ships should be sent to\r\nwatch us. Admiral Owen, Commander-in-Chief of the British Mediterranean\r\nSquadron, was ordered to hasten to Gibraltar without delay, and the\r\nPress, as may well be imagined, was not slow to take its share in all\r\nthis agitation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: POINT EUROPA, GIBRALTAR.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I was busily organising my little squadron at Toulon. Twelve\r\nhundred troops, or thereabouts, for disembarkation if necessary, had\r\nbeen sent me, and as fast as I got my ships ready I sent them on to\r\nOran, where we were to muster. Just as we were starting a slight\r\naccident occurred, which if I had been superstitiously inclined might\r\nhave cast a gloom over the first days of my command. We had towed the\r\nship Triton, with a body of marines on board, outside the port, one\r\nlovely evening. There we met a steamboat coming from Montpellier with a\r\ncompany of engineers, under Captain Coffinieres, who were also to be\r\nattached to the expedition. By some mistake in steering the ships\r\ncollided. The Triton was slightly damaged; but the steamboat lost her\r\nfunnel and spars, and had her bulwarks stove in. There was no damage to\r\nlife and limb, beyond an unintentional dip I took, by falling into the\r\nsea while getting alongside the two vessels to judge for myself whether\r\nthe collision was a serious one or not. I recollect, as a small matter\r\nof detail, that while we were coming back into Toulon at night, on\r\nboard the tug from which I had seen the accident, we made experiments\r\nwith the electric light, and that when we turned it on an American\r\ncorvette lying in the port, her watch bolted in every direction,\r\nblinded by the dazzling light darted on them suddenly, they knew not\r\nwhence. More than forty years elapsed before these experiments received\r\nany practical application. Such is the power of routine!\r\n\r\nBut I must get back to my ships. Having mustered them all at Oran, and\r\nopened communications with General Bugeaud, I went straight to\r\nGibraltar, to confer with the English authorities before I did anything\r\nelse; and resolved to be the first to offer in the clearest and\r\nfrankest way any explanation they might desire of my intentions as to\r\npeace or war, and the part we expected neutral powers to play. Let me\r\nsay at once, that from the very first day till the end of the campaign,\r\nI never had occasion to speak otherwise than in terms of the highest\r\nsatisfaction of all my relations with the officers holding command in\r\nthe British naval force, and more especially with Admiral Owen, Captain\r\nLockyer, and Captain Provo Wallis. Our intercourse was always frank,\r\ncordial, \"straightforward,\" as English people call it, and very\r\npleasant in consequence. This was not the case when I had to do with\r\nGeneral Sir Robert Wilson, Governor of Gibraltar, a bitter enemy to\r\nFrance. In the earliest beginning of his career he had been attached to\r\nthe staff of the Russian army, had been through the campaign of 1812,\r\nand borne his part in inflicting the disasters which befell us during\r\nthe terrible retreat from Moscow, He played a very active part as\r\nBritish commissioner with the Allied Armies in 1813, behaving with\r\ngreat personal valour both at Dresden and Leipsic, and doing us\r\nfrequent mischief by the advice he gave to the Allies. Often, in his\r\nvery interesting Memoirs, he will be found complacently reckoning up\r\nthe losses that we should have suffered if his counsels had been acted\r\nupon. Sir Robert afterwards acquired a certain notoriety in Paris by\r\nacting as the principal agent in the escape of M. de Lavalette in 1815.\r\nA man of occasional chivalrous impulses, but passionate and restless,\r\nto the extent of being incapable of keeping quiet, he looked on his\r\nposition as Governor of Gibraltar not as a great military command\r\nalone, but as an active political post, and he had directed all this\r\nactivity, through Morocco, against our conquered Province of Algeria,\r\nand so against France herself. His goings to and fro betwixt Gibraltar\r\nand the opposite coast were a matter of common knowledge, and his\r\nnewspaper, the Gibraltar Chronicle, edited by his Colonial Secretary,\r\nrepeated every statement likely to lower French influence, make little\r\nof our arms, or stir up public feeling against us. Arms and war\r\nmaterial were openly exported to Tetuan and other towns in Morocco\r\nunder his very eyes. And, in short, it was easy to trace a great part\r\nof the confidence in their impunity which made Muley Abderrahman and\r\nhis government so hostile on our frontier-line, and so insolent in its\r\nreplies to our diplomatic agents, to his behaviour.\r\n\r\nSuch then was the principal personage with whom I had to deal from the\r\nvery outset of my mission. He was the object of my first overture. As\r\nsoon as I arrived, I proceeded to the Convent, as his official\r\nresidence is called, in full uniform, with all the captains belonging\r\nto my squadron. He received me with a politeness that bordered on the\r\nobsequious, and at once began to talk of the danger he apprehended from\r\nthe presence of my squadron on that coast and before the Moorish towns;\r\nthe danger to peace in general, on account of the conflicts likely to\r\nbe provoked; the danger of still further exciting the warlike passions\r\nof the Mussulman population; the danger to the safety of the Christian\r\nnatives, the European residents, and the consuls in Morocco; and,\r\nfinally, the danger to Mr. Hay, the British Consul-General, who had\r\njust started to give personal counsels of moderation to the Emperor\r\nMuley Abderrahman.\r\n\r\n\"But indeed, General,\" I replied, \"I shall be too glad not to take my\r\nships to Tangier, nor to any other point on the Morocco coast, during\r\nthe negotiations. We are tired of the state of things caused by the\r\ninsolence and hostility of the Moors along our frontier. We are going\r\nto present an ultimatum to put an end to it. We will allow them a\r\ncertain interval to reply in, and when that is up, we shall go to\r\nTangier, either to punish or to forgive them. UNTIL THEN we shall be\r\nvery glad of any efforts that may be made to calm public feeling and\r\nfacilitate the acceptance of our just demands. UNTIL THEN I am quite\r\nprepared not to take my squadron to the coast of Morocco; but on one\r\ncondition only--that the British ships do not go there either. We\r\ncannot allow our dispute to be discussed under the guns of a foreign\r\nfleet, nor that there should be any question of protection or\r\nintimidation in the matter. If you, and the naval authorities with you,\r\nwill promise that your ships shall not go to Tangier, I will take mine\r\nto Cadiz, without touching there either, and await the reply to our\r\nultimatum. Of course I have nothing to say about your small vessels\r\ngoing to Tangier to protect your fellow-countrymen, and mine will do\r\nthe same thing.\"\r\n\r\nThat ended my lecture, and I was about to take my leave, but Sir Robert\r\nkept up a conversation on various subjects, till all at once he started\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"Why, I was forgetting the time! The gates will be shut. If you want to\r\nget back to the port, gentlemen, you must start at once. Hurry up! you\r\nhaven't a moment to lose.\"\r\n\r\nI always thought that little scene was a got up thing: not indeed for\r\nthe sake of the absurd sight of the French admiral and his captains\r\ntearing breathlessly along in full uniform like people who are afraid\r\nof missing a train, but to give us an idea of the strictness of the\r\nregulations under that particular governorship. Of which strictness we\r\nhad another proof on the following evening.\r\n\r\nA boat coming ashore from the \"Jemappes\" to take off the officers, who\r\nhad been dining on shore, at the postern gate known as the Ragged\r\nStaff, which had been left open for their convenience, made a mistake\r\nin the darkness, and came alongside of another landing stage, the guard\r\nof which turned out and fired a volley, which luckily did not hit\r\nanybody.\r\n\r\nThe proposal I made during my first visit to Sir Robert was carried\r\nout. I was given a promise that no English ship should appear at\r\nTangier; and I, on my side, took my squadron to Cadiz, while M. de\r\nNion, our consul-general, presented our ultimatum to Muley Abderrahman.\r\nThen came a long period of uncertainty. Warships arrived at Tangier\r\ndirect from England. As soon as I heard of it I set sail to follow\r\nthem; but on my arrival, finding the authorities at Gibraltar had\r\nalready recalled them, I returned to Cadiz.\r\n\r\nWhen the answer to our ultimatum did come, it was most unsatisfactory.\r\nThe Moorish Government refused to disperse the assemblage of troops\r\nmassed on General Bugeaud's front; and even went so far as to demand\r\nthat he should be punished for having violated their frontier more than\r\nonce, in his pursuit of the bands that had attacked him. And there was\r\nnot one word concerning the chief subject of our complaints,\r\nAbd-el-Kadir.\r\n\r\nWe might have taken immediate steps, on the reception of this news, but\r\nit was indispensable that the safety of our consuls, and our\r\nfellow-countrymen resident in Tangier, whom the first cannon-shot would\r\nexpose to all the violence of Mussulman fanaticism, should be ensured\r\nfirst of all. Then there was the presence of the British Consul-General\r\nat the Emperor's court to be considered. If his mission was not\r\nactually official, it was semi-official at all events; and we were\r\nobliged to await his return. To give some colour to our delay, M. de\r\nNion sent a fresh summons to Sidi Bousselam, pasha of Larrache, a\r\nclear-sighted and intelligent man, whom the Sultan had deputed to\r\nnegotiate with us. A fresh extension of time was granted. I took\r\nadvantage of it to get our consuls withdrawn, and went myself to\r\nTangier to see to the sudden removal of our consul-general and his\r\nfamily. If this had been attempted a few minutes later, the Moors would\r\nhave tried to prevent it. All the other French subjects and people\r\nunder our protection, who had put off going on board our ships, were\r\nstopped, except one Jew, who rushed up at full speed, threw himself\r\ninto the sea, and managed to come up with my boat. I should add, that\r\nowing to the energetic remonstrances of all the other foreign\r\nrepresentatives, and in particular the Neapolitan Consul, M. de\r\nMartino--a clever and courageous young man who has since risen to the\r\nhighest positions in Italy, and who had undertaken to look after our\r\ninterests after our consuls had been withdrawn--the embargo thus laid\r\non our fellow-countrymen's movements was of very short duration.\r\n\r\nThe departure of the French consuls made a considerable impression both\r\non the Moorish leaders and on the foreign representatives, who took\r\nalarm at once. The roadstead at Tangier was soon covered, in answer to\r\ntheir appeals, with foreign warships, Spanish, Danish, Swedish, &c. The\r\nEnglish men-of-war returned, and I brought back my own squadron.\r\n\r\nBut still the time went by, and Mr. Hay did not appear. General\r\nBugeaud, away on the frontier, was losing patience, and wrote me letter\r\nafter letter, complaining of my tergiversation!\" To which I replied,\r\n\"Well, General, fire off your guns! If you will begin the fighting I'll\r\nfollow your example at once.\" But the general turned a deaf ear to\r\nthat. He answered that pacific overtures which he could not well ignore\r\nwere being made him on the frontier side, but that things could not go\r\non as they were, that his troops were suffering from the heat, that\r\nthey were fretting under their enforced inaction. The long and the\r\nshort of it was that he would not take the responsibility of the\r\ninternational complications that might arise out of overt hostilities\r\nin Morocco, and yet he was burning with the desire to throw himself\r\nupon the army lying in front of him and inflict a signal defeat on it.\r\nWhile he neither urged me on nor tried to check me, diplomacy did its\r\nutmost to restrain my ardour. The French charge d'affaires in London\r\nwrote to point out \"the capital importance attached in this country\r\n(England) to the business you have in hand. If it were to come to a\r\nblockade, an occupation of ports and of the coast, &c., I feel quite\r\nconvinced that the relations between your Royal Highness and the\r\nBritish cruisers would keep the peace of the world in general in\r\nconstant peril.\" And the tide kept rising and rising, higher and\r\nhigher! In other words, time was going by--in inaction. And some people\r\nwere inclined to take inaction for impotence.\r\n\r\nAt last, on the 4th of August, M. de Nion received an answer, and not\r\nan acceptable one, to his last note, still harping on \"the punishment\r\nof the general.\" We had had enough of that sort of thing. On the 5th a\r\ndespatch-boat brought me news of the safety of Mr. Hay, the British\r\nPlenipotentiary, on board an English ship, and of the failure of his\r\nmission. On the 6th I attacked the fortifications of Tangier in the\r\npresence of ships of war of every nation, British battleships, and\r\nSpanish frigates. The object of our demonstration was eminently clear.\r\nWe were proving to the Moors, whom we chastised, as to the foreigners\r\nwho were looking on, that France intended to ensure her Algerian\r\nfrontier being respected, and that no foreign protection would save\r\nthose who violated it from punishment.\r\n\r\nThe shelling of Tangier was much more of a political act than of an act\r\nof warfare. Though eighty pieces of artillery replied to our first\r\nshots, their fire was swiftly silenced by the admirable practice made\r\nby our capital gunners. Not a shot went wide of the enemy's embrasures,\r\nnor did a single one fall on the dwelling-houses, nor on the consular\r\nquarter of the town. Our loss was insignificant I have not the figures\r\nby me, but I do not think we had more than fifteen or twenty men\r\ndisabled. No damage was done to the fleet. My ship, the Suffren, had\r\nnot more than fifty shots in her hull and spars.\r\n\r\nGeneral Bugeaud, with whom I at once communicated, wrote to me soon\r\nafterwards as follows:\r\n\r\nI told you on the 11th, that the army would lose no time about\r\nhonouring the draft the navy had drawn on it. By the enclosed copy of a\r\ntelegram to his Excellency the Minister of War you will see it has kept\r\nits word.\r\n\r\nThe despatch in question contained the report of the battle of Isly,\r\nwhich had just been fought; and the letter was dated from the\r\nbattlefield itself, on August 14th. On that same 14th of August I was\r\nbefore Mogador with the squadron. Having sent out three very\r\nintelligent officers, Colonel Chauchard, and Captain Coffinieres of the\r\nEngineers, and a post-captain, the heir to a glorious name, Vicomte\r\nDuquesne, to reconnoitre, I had resolved, on their information, to\r\nchoose this particular town and its port, as offering the best chance\r\nof a successful attack. Another consideration too had weighed with\r\nme--the customs duties at Mogador supplied the greater part of Muley\r\nAbderrahman's revenue. We had dissipated his illusions at Tangier, and\r\nwhile the general was lowering his pride on the battlefield of Isly, I\r\nwas going to make a hole in his purse.\r\n\r\nBad weather, rough seas, serious damage to chains, and anchors broken\r\non the inhospitable rocks, gave us a world of trouble. At last, on the\r\n15th of August, the sea was calmer, and with a favourable breeze we\r\nwere able to take up our attacking position opposite Mogador. The town,\r\nbeing strongly fortified, heavily armed, and having besides had time to\r\nprepare for us, made a much tougher defence than Tangier. But we\r\nmastered it at last, and the fire from the citadel having been silenced\r\nby the guns of the Suffren, Jetnmapes, Triton, and the Belle-Poule\r\nfrigate, I took the flotilla into the channel, and landed five hundred\r\nmen on the island which forms the port. This was done under a very hot\r\nmusketry fire, but it was performed in the boldest and smartest manner,\r\nthe men who were wounded in the boats being among the first to spring\r\non shore. The batteries were carried at the double, and the whole\r\ngarrison of the island, about four hundred men, were either killed,\r\ndrowned, or driven at nightfall into a large mosque, which they\r\nsurrendered the next morning.\r\n\r\nThere never was a more picturesque sight than the close of that fight,\r\nunder a sunset like the one I saw Horace Vernet paint in his fine\r\npicture of the battle of Montmirail. The Moors in their brilliant\r\ndresses were retiring, firing as they went, towards the mosque, whose\r\ngreat towers rose tall against the sky; while our small craft, running\r\nalong the shore on a golden summer sea, supported our soldiers on land\r\nby their fire. I recollect finding myself just at that moment beside a\r\nyoung sub-lieutenant, fresh from St. Cyr, M. Martin des Pallieres, whom\r\nI had permitted, at his own urgent request, to land as a volunteer,\r\nalthough his company was not detailed for service. He proudly showed me\r\nhis arm, smashed by a ball, saying:\r\n\r\n\"You see, sir, you did well to let me come!\"\r\n\r\nThe whole of the assault of this island was very well led by Colonel\r\nChauchard and Captain Duquesne, who was wounded in the engagement.\r\n\r\nMy first care, the next day, was to send some of my prisoners back to\r\nthe pasha of Mogador, with an intimation that if he touched a hair on\r\nthe heads of the British Consul and his family, and a few other\r\nEuropeans whom he had refused to allow to depart before the attack, I\r\nwould take reprisals by putting all the rest of my prisoners to death.\r\nI had the satisfaction of receiving the consul and his belongings on\r\nboard my ship, and of transferring them to the English frigate\r\nWarspite, which had been present as a spectator during all our\r\noperations. It was none too soon, for the Arabs and Kabyles from the\r\nneighbouring country were already pouring into the town to sack and\r\nplunder it. The pasha, overwhelmed by their numbers and no longer able\r\nto maintain order, was obliged to take to flight himself, and no\r\nChristian could have remained in the town without running the gravest\r\nrisk.\r\n\r\nWe soon landed in the town of Mogador to complete the work of\r\ndestruction begun the day before, spike the guns, smash up the\r\ngun-carriages, and destroy all the munitions of war in the shore\r\nbatteries--all of which was performed without a shadow of opposition\r\nbeing offered. Then I put a garrison on the island, providing it with\r\nheavy guns, to awe the town, which we did not care to occupy, and I\r\ndeclared the port to be in a state of blockade.\r\n\r\nWhen all this was settled, I sent back the bulk of the squadron to\r\nCadiz to revictual, and get ready to recommence operations, if\r\nnecessary. During the whole of this campaign the only staff I had to\r\nhelp me to direct sailing and fighting operations, and above all to\r\nsupply a naval force numbering seventeen sail, not reckoning my\r\ndisembarkation craft, with food, coal, and munitions of war, was one\r\nfirst lieutenant, who acted as chief of the staff, aide-de-camp, &c.,\r\none second class cadet to go messages and keep the look out, and the\r\npurser of my own ship, the Suffren.\r\n\r\nIt is true all these were first-rate men. The two officers have both\r\nbecome admirals--one is Admiral Touchard and the other Admiral Pierre.\r\nThe purser's name was Roumo. I merely mention this detail because, with\r\nthe present mania for large staffs, things would be less simply managed\r\nnowadays. I should like to add that I found my best assistance in the\r\ngoodwill, pluck, intelligence, and devotion to their country's\r\ninterests invariably shown by everybody, without distinction of rank.\r\nIn short, the behaviour of the naval force I had the honour of\r\ncommanding was even better than I could have expected of it. The\r\nservice still bears the same good character, and will continue to bear\r\nit so long as no one lays a sacrilegious hand on an organisation the\r\nvalue of which has been thoroughly tested, and which now rests on long\r\nand splendid traditions.\r\n\r\nBut one misfortune befell us. The Groenland, a large transport, was\r\nwrecked some way south of Larrache. By some miscalculation or other she\r\nran aground, going nine knots an hour, at high water, on a spring tide,\r\nat the foot of a cliff as high as those of the English Channel. When\r\nthe fog cleared, some Arabs, very few fortunately, on the top of the\r\nrocks, saw her, and poured their fire into her with perfect impunity.\r\n\r\nOne of our despatch-boats, the Vedette, becoming aware of the\r\ncatastrophe, hurried to the trooper's assistance; but she was almost\r\npowerless, her engines not being strong enough to tow off a big ship\r\nstranded in such a deplorable position. The shots fired from below at\r\nthe Arabs on the summit of the cliff only attracted more of them to the\r\nspot. But at all events they were useful in so far as they made me\r\naware of the disaster.\r\n\r\nI was passing by, out at sea, on board the Pluton, on my way to Cadiz,\r\nwhen the sound of the guns, which was very unexpected thereabouts,\r\nattracted my attention, and steering towards the noise I soon caught\r\nsight of the unlucky Greenland lying close ashore, while the\r\nrifle-shots flashed from the top of the cliff. It was just getting dark\r\nwhen I reached the spot. I boarded the ship at once, no easy matter,\r\nfor a heavy surf was breaking on her stern, the only part of her which\r\nwas at all accessible. But they threw me a rope and hoisted me on board.\r\n\r\nThe unlucky officer in command, Captain Besson, had done everything in\r\nhis power after the vessel had gone ashore. He had laid out anchors,\r\nlightened the ship, and cut down her masts and spars. Then, in the\r\npluckiest way, he had tried to go about, under the full fire of the\r\nArabs. Fourteen of his men had been killed or wounded at the capstan\r\nbars. But the cables gave way, and the only result of lightening the\r\nship was that the swell carried her closer in shore. I went down to the\r\nengine-room, which was full of water. It was clear to my mind that her\r\nside was stove in. It was out of the question to make any attempt to\r\nfloat such a large vessel--a difficult enough job on a friendly\r\ncoast--under the rifle-fire of the thousands of Arabs who were sure to\r\ngather on the cliff at daybreak.\r\n\r\nIf the sea rose, the ship would not only go to pieces, but it would be\r\nimpossible to rescue her passengers and crew. I therefore settled to\r\nproceed at once to the removal of the wounded, in the first place, and\r\nthen of the rest of the soldiers and sailors on board. This was carried\r\nout without any accident. Captain Besson was the last man to leave his\r\nship, having first, at my request, set her on fire, so as to leave\r\nnothing in the way of a trophy in the enemy's hands.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at Cadiz, besides letters from the Minister for Naval\r\nAffairs, Admiral de Mackau, signifying the approval of his Majesty's\r\nGovernment of what I had done, I found one from General Bugeaud (who\r\nhad been created a marshal), in which he said:\r\n\r\nI have just received your despatch of lyth August, which has caused me\r\nthe greatest joy. In spite of the great distance between them, the\r\nharmony between our military and naval operations has been complete The\r\nMoorish army was defeated on the 14th, and Mogador was shelled and\r\ncaptured on the 15th.\r\n\r\nBetween the two victories, the Princesse de Joinville has made you a\r\nhappy father. It seems to me that the young Princess ought certainly to\r\nreceive the name of Victoria.\r\n\r\nI am very happy to assure you that you cannot be more pleased with your\r\nfleet than the army is with both it and you.\r\n\r\nI was busy revictualling and refitting, and reorganising my squadron,\r\nwhen M. de Martino sent word that Muley Abdurrahman was sueing for\r\npeace, and had given Sidi Bousselam full powers for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThere was a regular congress of diplomats at Cadiz. M. Guizot had\r\nassociated young Decazes--known to all the world in later days as\r\nMarshal MacMahon's Foreign Minister--with M. de Nion, our decharge\r\nd'affaires at Tangier. And then, behind the diplomatic curtain, there\r\nwas the British Minister in Spain, Mr. Bulwer, who took the deepest\r\ninterest in our proceedings, and like his chief, Lord Aberdeen,\r\nsincerely desired to see the Morocco question dead and buried.\r\nEverybody was eager to draw up protocols. But I thought it much better\r\nto let ourselves be pressed a little, and make the Moors feel a little\r\nkeener anxiety to get rid of the blockade on Mogador, which practically\r\ncut off all their supplies. I therefore suggested sending the\r\ninterpreter of the fleet, Dr. Warnier--a brave and clever man, one of\r\nthe Frenchmen who, with General Daumas, Leon Roche, and others, had,\r\nformerly followed the fortunes of Abd-el-Kadir, and quite capable of\r\ndetecting all the tricks of Arab diplomacy--to meet Bousselam, with\r\norders to ask whether he really was invested with full powers from the\r\nEmperor, and to request him, in that case, to produce an official\r\ndocument in proof of his assertion. In the event of the reply being in\r\nthe affirmative, the squadron to return to Tangier, bringing the French\r\nplenipotentiaries, and with them a treaty ready drawn up, containing\r\nthe conditions imposed by France, to be signed within twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nSo matters were settled.\r\n\r\nAnd what were the stipulations of the treaty?\r\n\r\nNot very many. But it gave the deathblow to Abdel-Kadir, whom the\r\nEmperor of Morocco undertook to proclaim an outlaw. The real treaty of\r\npeace had been signed at Tangier, at Isly, and at Mogador. We had no\r\nobject, once we had gained those victories, in imposing too severe\r\nconditions, which would have weakened and even destroyed his authority,\r\non the Moorish Sovereign. It was far better to have a ruler on our\r\nfrontier who had experience both of our armed strength and of our\r\ngenerosity, and to whose interest it consequently was to live on\r\nfriendly terms with us, than to have to keep up a struggle with\r\nMussulman anarchy, which might end in opening the door to international\r\nintervention.\r\n\r\nThe treaty inspired by these considerations was duly signed, and the\r\norder to evacuate the Island of Mogador and raise the blockade was\r\nforthwith given. The flag was hoisted once more over the French\r\nconsulate, and saluted both on shore and by our ships in port. The\r\nMorocco dispute was closed.\r\n\r\nIn the result, Abd-el-Kadir, hemmed in in Morocco as he had formerly\r\nbeen in Algeria, was forced, in 1847, after a short period of wandering\r\nand helplessness, to make his submission to my brother Aumale. From the\r\ndate of the signing of the treaty of Tangier up to the present day, no\r\nserious misunderstanding has ever arisen between ourselves and the\r\nEmpire of Morocco.\r\n\r\nThe signature of peace was the signal for the dispersal of the squadron\r\nunder my orders. I myself returned to Paris by Havre, where I learnt\r\nthat a public reception, which I was not sorry to escape, had been\r\nprepared for me at Toulon. Feeling conscious, as I did, of having done\r\nmy country good service during my four months of campaigning, praise\r\nand blame alike were equally indifferent to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n1844-1848\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were great festivities at Naples, towards the end of 1854, in\r\nhonour of the marriage of my brother Aumale and his cousin, the\r\ncharming daughter of the Prince of Salerno. During the civil marriage,\r\nwhich took place at the palace, the King never left off tormenting the\r\nsyndic of Naples, who figured in a full black Spanish suit in\r\nseventeenth-century style, and a wig with long floating curls. At the\r\nreligious ceremony, numbers of lovely women in court dress, and men\r\nbearing great and historic names--such as the Marquis de Pescaire del\r\nVasto, the Princes Colonna and Campo Reale, the Dukes of Ascoli and San\r\nCesarea, and many others--gathered round the Royal Family. France was\r\nrepresented by Admiral de Parseval and the officers of the squadron,\r\nand by General Durosnel, who was aide-de-camp to my father, after\r\nhaving served Napoleon in the same capacity. He was an old soldier, the\r\nvery personification of honour, with a memory stored with most\r\ninteresting recollections. The French Embassy, placed beside these\r\ngentlemen, made a fine figure with the Due and Duchesse de Montebello\r\nat its head, accompanied by M. Lutteroth and his wife, the sister of\r\nthat Count Batthyani who was executed in Hungary under such\r\nheartrending circumstances in the year 1848. The general public of\r\nFrance was represented among the spectators by M. Glais-Bizoin, who\r\nmade a less fine effect, as those who have known the triumvir of Tours\r\nin 1870 will readily believe. He was one of the ugliest men in creation.\r\n\r\nThen there was the whole diplomatic body, and foremost among its\r\nmembers the Austrian Minister, Prince Felix von Schwarzenberg, whose\r\nacquaintance I was very glad to make. He was an exceedingly pleasant\r\nman, the very type of a distinguished aristocrat, with a splendid head,\r\nclever and proud-looking at once, and a tall slight figure. He looked\r\nmagnificent in his white uniform, that of an Austrian general, and\r\nturned all the ladies' heads. His love affairs were endless, and some\r\nof them have become celebrated, such as his elopement with a great lady\r\nin English society, who, when he left her, ended her days under the\r\ntent of an Arab chief, near Palmyra, described by Edmond About in Le\r\nRoi des Montagnes.\r\n\r\nWhen once his passion was roused, he allowed no obstacle to stand in\r\nhis way, and I never saw any man beset a woman with his addresses, in\r\npublic, whatever her position might be, with such magnificent\r\nindifference to what people said, or to the consequences which might\r\npossibly ensue. And indeed his audacity generally paid. Later on he\r\ncarried it into politics, and with equal success. My readers may know\r\nthat he came into power in 1848, when the affairs of the House of\r\nAustria were at their lowest ebb, Vienna in revolution, Hungary in\r\nrebellion, and Lombardy invaded.\r\n\r\nFull of confidence in the strength of the dynastic principle in the\r\ncountry, he induced two incapable emperors to abdicate, himself took\r\nyoung Francis Joseph to be solemnly invested with his sovereignty at\r\nSanta Lucia, among Radetsky's riflemen, just before the battle of\r\nNovara, made the alliance with Russia which forced Hungary into\r\nsubmission, and having thus snatched his country from the jaws of\r\nrevolution and ruin, died on his feet, just after keeping an\r\nassignation. He was the man who made the well-known and characteristic\r\nremark, \"You can do everything with bayonets--except sit on them!\"\r\n\r\nWe had a constant succession of merry-makings. There was a state\r\nperformance at the San Carlo, with a ballet danced by very pretty\r\nfigurantes, whose tights were pink to below their knees only, the rest\r\nwas apple-green. This detail was insisted on to spare the modesty of\r\nthe management. I am not aware whether the genuine article profited in\r\nany way by the rule. When the San Carlo was over, we had San Carlino or\r\nPulcinella. This character, peculiar to the local stage (who is\r\nsupposed to have originated in Acerra, as Arlequino did in Bergamo),\r\nsupported by his inseparable companion Pancrazio, poked fun to his\r\nheart's content, and in the raciest of burlesque, at all the latest\r\nNeapolitan occurrences and fashions, in a piece entitled Pulcinella\r\nalia Strada Ferrata.\r\n\r\nThere were balls to go to, when the theatres were over, at the palace,\r\nat the academy, and at our embassy. In the daytime there were shooting\r\nparties at Capo di Monte or Caserta. Those Neapolitan shooting parties\r\nare a thing of the past. I have heard my brother-in-law, King Leopold,\r\ntell how once, when he had been invited by the King to a shoot of large\r\nand small game at Mondragone, at which, in the course of a few days,\r\nthree thousand woodcock had been killed, besides other game, he stayed\r\non for a day longer than the other sportsmen, and in one morning he\r\nbrought down sixty woodcock put up by his dog, on the very ground that\r\nhad just been shot over.\r\n\r\nTo wind up our stay at Naples we christened one of the Due de\r\nMontebello's sons. The ceremony was performed after the Italian fashion\r\nin a drawing-room belonging to the Prince of Salerno, himself a\r\nthorough Neapolitan, with his wit and exaggerated drolleries, and the\r\nuproar he made and caused wherever he betook himself. This same uproar\r\nhad already terrified the baby, when out of a sort of cupboard chapel a\r\nworthy chaplain, an old friend of my mother's, Monsignore Corbi, was\r\nseen to advance. The monsignore, who was exceedingly ugly, and very\r\nshort in stature, had a huge mitre on his head, and looked so\r\ndiabolical altogether that the child writhed in terror at the sight,\r\nand screamed in the most unearthly manner, while to quiet it the\r\ndignitary yelled in a squeaky voice, Bello, bello! (\"Pretty, pretty!\"),\r\nwhich only terrified it all the more.\r\n\r\nOn our way back from Naples we were caught in a violent gale outside\r\nthe Straits of Bonifacio, which did some damage to the ship and\r\ndemoralised the ladies. In consequence of this, instead of going\r\nstraight to Marseilles, where a brilliant reception was awaiting the\r\nDuchesse d'Aumale, we put in at Toulon. There the Duchesse landed and\r\nwent on to Marseilles by land, while I went round by sea.\r\n\r\nBut this did not suit the official masters of the ceremonies, and put\r\nout all their preparations for an ovation. The arrival had been planned\r\nto be by sea, and by sea it must be, or everything would be spoilt. So\r\nthe poor Duchesse was taken quietly by a roundabout road to the old wet\r\ndock, where she was put on board, and after a slight detour, she\r\narrived in approved nautical fashion, and disembarked at the foot of\r\nthe Cannebiere \"amidst a scene of indescribable enthusiasm,\" as the\r\nofficial descriptions would say.\r\n\r\nThe only recollections I have of those Marseilles fetes are musical\r\nones. First of all that of King Rene's band, with tabour, pipes, and\r\ntambourines, escorting the \"prud' hommes\" fishermen dressed in Henri\r\nQuatre costumes. And secondly, that of a violoncello solo, admirably\r\nplayed by Offenbach, who was then quite young, and a musician in heart\r\nand soul, but who had not yet shown his great talent as a composer.\r\n\r\nI tore myself, however, from all these rejoicings, which bored me very\r\nmuch, to go and see the haven of Bouc, the Martigues, and the pool of\r\nBerre, where but very little is required to complete a matchless piece\r\nof Nature's work and turn it into the finest port in the whole world I\r\nwas deeply interested in all I saw, in company with Admiral Baudin and\r\nengineers, both military and naval, who had brought all the plans with\r\nthem. But our trade still goes to Marseilles and our warships to\r\nToulon, and the two habits have taken such deep root that it is\r\nhopeless to fight against them. And the conclusion we came to was that,\r\nsave as regarded deepening the entrance to the haven of Bouc (which has\r\nsince been done), matters were not likely to alter to any very great\r\nextent. I seem yet to hear a young engineer des ponts et chaussees, who\r\nwas a member of our party, grumbling between his teeth, as he rolled up\r\nhis plans, that there were a good many other things in Provence that\r\nnobody could alter--notably the purity of outline of the Arlesian\r\ngirls. He pronounced purete badly, and it sounded like durete. He may\r\nhave done it out of mischief, for when he looked at me he burst out\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\nAll this coming and going between Morocco and Naples had kept me far\r\naway enough from Paris and the battlefield of politics. When I got\r\nback, in the winter of 1845, the July Monarchy had still three years of\r\nlife before it, but an odour of sickliness hung about it already.\r\n\r\nThe St. Vitus's dance of parliamentary politics gave no satisfaction to\r\nanybody except the Jerome-Paturots, to whom it gave a social standing.\r\nBut how many envious individuals were there to every one who was\r\ncontent? Parliament gave no strength then to the Government, which was\r\nthe object of almost unanimous attack on the part of the Press; and, by\r\na strange contradiction, the chief reproach cast at an order of things\r\nwhich every one was striving to discredit and overthrow was its want of\r\nenergy. How often, since that time, have I heard that cry \"Be strong,\"\r\nwhich is the invariable death-knell of governments in extremities!\r\n\r\nWhile the love of destruction--which is the essence of the\r\nrevolutionary spirit, aided by democratic jealousies, and political\r\nspeculators--was openly pursuing its destructive work, unopposed and\r\nunfettered save by empty verbiage and futile restrictions, the healthy\r\nappearance of the daily social life of the capital seemed unchanged.\r\nThe peaceful regime of 1830, which had been fortunate enough to endow\r\nFrance with her first railways, and which was extending them with wise\r\nactivity, was soon to see the dawn of one of the most fruitful\r\ndiscoveries in science--the electric telegraph, the first practical\r\napplication of which dates from 1845. The fine arts shone brilliantly\r\nunder the encouragement of an enlightened ruler. Eugene Delacroix sent\r\nsplendid canvases, the Entree des Croises a Constantinople, among\r\nothers, to the Versailles Museum, the generous and personal creation of\r\nKing Louis Philippe. Meissonier's masterpieces were spreading his\r\nreputation far and wide, and near him clustered a swarm of great\r\nlandscape painters--Corot, Jules Dupre, Rousseau, Troyon. Henriquel\r\nDupont, that prince of engravers, was sending out wonderful proofs,\r\nsuch as Gustavus Vasa and the Hemicycle. And what actors there were on\r\nthe boards! Not to mention the Theatre Italieri, with that incomparable\r\ntrio Grisi, Lablache, and Mario--Parisians by adoption--and then in the\r\nheyday of their talent; the Francais, the Porte-Saint-Martin, and the\r\nGymnase, all offered us representations which approached very nearly to\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nThe recollection of Le Menteur, as played in the Tuileries Theatre by\r\nFirmin, Samson, and Regnier, with Mdmes. Plessy, Anai's, and Augustine\r\nBrohan, is constantly with me. At the Porte-Saint-Martin were Frederic\r\nLemaltre and Madame Dorval, startling in their poignant truthfulness\r\nand dramatic power in that terrible drama Trente Ans, oil la Vie d'un\r\nJoueur. And at the Gymnase we had Rose Cheri.\r\n\r\nIf I talk so much about theatres, it must be remembered that the\r\ntheatre is one of our glories. What other country has a Comedie\r\nFranchise--an institution two centuries old, miraculously respected, so\r\nfar, amidst all our ruins, by the hammer of the revolutionary destroyer.\r\n\r\nI talk of theatres, too, because I spent many an evening in them. The\r\nrest passed peacefully away in the \"family drawing-room,\" which well\r\ndeserved its name, for we all met there, old and young, big and little,\r\nafter the evening meal, which was always partaken of in common.\r\n\r\nIn that drawing-room, on the first floor of the Tuileries, between the\r\nPavilion de Flore and the Pavilion de l'Horloge, my mother used to sit\r\ndoing her fancy work at a round table lighted by shaded candles, with\r\nmy aunt Adelaide, the young princesses, and the ladies-in-waiting near\r\nher. The King sat on a window seat in the billiard-room adjoining the\r\ndrawing-room, and there received the despatches brought him by his\r\nsecretary, Baron Fain, and read the Times, the only newspaper he was in\r\nthe habit of reading daily. It was there the gentlemen visitors,\r\nchiefly diplomats, who wanted to speak to him, joined him; while the\r\nlady visitors sat round the Queen's table, at which the conversation\r\nwas general, if occasionally soporific. It used to brighten up again\r\nwith the arrival of any ladies whose wit or beauty attracted the men\r\nwho had scattered about the drawing-room. This was always the case on\r\nthe appearance of Mesdames de St. Aulaire and de Castellane, of some\r\ncharming members of the corps diplomatique, the Princess de Ligne,\r\nMesdames Firmin Rogier and de Stockhausen, or again of three sisters,\r\ndaughters of M. de Laborde, Mesdames Delessert, Bocher, and Odier.\r\nThree magnificent Englishwomen, the Sheridan sisters, had formerly\r\ncaused a great sensation. Now it was the turn of Princesse Mathilde,\r\nthen at the height of her beauty; and there were many others besides.\r\n\r\nAmong the gentlemen, a strong contingent of our visitors was furnished\r\nby the foreigners passing through Paris--Prince Paul of Wurtemberg,\r\nPrince Max of Bavaria, Prince Paul Esterhazy. Amongst the English were\r\nDisraeli, Bear Ellis, Charles Fox, Monckton Milnes, &c., &c. There were\r\nnumbers of Spaniards. Sometimes M. von Humboldt would give us a\r\nreading, not invariably amusing. However, to make up for that, I have\r\nheard Prince Belgiojoso, the husband of the beautiful deep-eyed\r\nTrivulce, sing, with a voice that was exquisite. But the catalogue of\r\nvisitors would be an endless one. Yet I cannot pass on without\r\nmentioning among our most constant habitues, at that time Marshal\r\nSebastiani, one of a circle of intimate friends presided over by my\r\naunt Adelaide.\r\n\r\nThis little gathering, of which M. de Talleyrand had been an assiduous\r\nmember, and where Marshal Gerard, M. Dupin, Flahaut, a certain General\r\nde Lavcestine (who downright toadied my aunt, her valet de chambre, and\r\nher very parrot), and a few other faithful friends were in the habit of\r\nmeeting, took place in the morning, in that charming set of rooms on\r\nthe ground-floor of the Pavilion de Flore, the windows of which looked\r\non the corner of the Pont Royal and on the gate into the Tuileries\r\ngardens. From these windows the quaintest sights were to be seen, not\r\nthe least entertaining of which were the Homeric struggles of the\r\nsentries of the National Guard, absolute slaves to their orders, to\r\nprevent dogs which were not led by a string from following their owners\r\ninto the Tuileries gardens, in which struggles the bold city guard, in\r\nspite of prodigies of valour, not unfrequently got beaten.\r\n\r\nMy good aunt Adelaide started, towards springtime in 1845, to pay her\r\nfirst visit to an estate she owned at Arc-en-Barrois, in the\r\nHaute-Marne, and as she intended leaving it to me in her will she took\r\nme with her. The property in question, originally belonging to Vitry,\r\nthe Captain of the Guard under Louis XIII., who killed the Marechal\r\nd'Ancre, had afterwards passed into the hands of the Penthievre family,\r\nand then into the possession of mine, like all the rest of the\r\nPenthievre inheritance. My great-grandfather, the Due de Penthievre,\r\nhad lived there a good deal in a fine house, which was of course\r\nplundered and destroyed during the Revolution, notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat the good prince had done a great deal of good in that country,\r\nwhere his name is still venerated.\r\n\r\nAll the local authorities flocked around to pay their respects on the\r\noccasion of that first visit, and amongst others the prefect of the\r\ndepartment, M. Romieu, who had made himself some celebrity in his youth\r\nby reason of a variety of carnival pranks performed in the company of a\r\nwell-known band of boon companions. I recollect them perfectly well.\r\nAmong them was Lord Henry Seymour, who paraded the boulevards,\r\nsurrounded by ladies in the most elegant costumes, in a carriage and\r\nfour, with powdered and beribboned postilions, stopping at the public\r\nsquares to harangue the crowd in flowery language, to delighted shouts\r\nof Vive milord l'Arsouille! (Long live the blackguard lord!). And then\r\nthere was another Englishman, Lord Clanricarde, the most inimitable of\r\nPierrots, in a black skull-cap, with his melancholy face whitened,\r\nplaying a series of nocturnal jokes, with the roof of a fiacre for his\r\nplatform. Count d'Alton, too, M. de Chateauvillard, and others, were\r\nthe authors of all kinds of witty fooling. Romieu's best-known exploit\r\nwas his having laid a friend, who had been indulging too freely, one\r\nfine night, in the middle of the street, with a lighted lantern laid on\r\nhis chest to save him from being run over.\r\n\r\nBut our prefect was not fond of that particular story, for I remember a\r\nvery indirect allusion to it which I was unlucky enough to make in\r\nfamiliar conversation, during a shooting-party, at which he appeared in\r\na blue blouse and leather cap, was strongly resented by him. Drawing\r\nhimself up, he thus apostrophised me:\r\n\r\n\"I beg your Royal Highness will give me credit for being a very serious\r\nprefect.\"\r\n\r\nI took the hint, and only talked to him about the damage done by\r\ncockchafers, and the difficulty of getting hard enough stone for the\r\nmacadam roads, thenceforward. The poor gentleman, after having played a\r\ncertain part in the reaction after the Revolution of 1848, by the\r\npublication of a sensational pamphlet entitled Le Spectre Rouge, died\r\nof grief at the death of a son who was killed at Sevastopol.\r\n\r\nI was obliged to make a cure at Vichy during the summer, the successive\r\nfevers I had suffered from in hot climates having affected my liver.\r\nFor this purpose I went to the Chateau de Randan, where I endured cruel\r\nanguish of mind, for my daughter fell dangerously ill. She made a happy\r\nrecovery, thanks to the care of a young military doctor, at once a\r\nclever physician and one of the kindest of men, named Alphonse\r\nPasquier. He was murdered by the Communards after the siege of Paris.\r\n\r\nFrom Randan I went to Eu, for a second visit from Queen Victoria, which\r\nwas favoured by splendid weather, and was as simple and affectionate in\r\nits nature as her first.\r\n\r\nThe year 1845 came to an end, and the first recollection that comes\r\nback to me in 1846 is that of a hunting-party, which was marked by a\r\nfresh attempt on my father's life. It was on the 15th of August. We\r\nwere all at Fontainebleau, whither the King was fond of going, to watch\r\nthe progress of the splendid restoration of the galleries of Francis\r\nthe First and Henri II., which he was having carried out. I was\r\nboar-hunting that day with Henri Greffulhe's pack.\r\n\r\nDuring a check we had met the King, who had got out of his carriage at\r\nthe cross roads at the Monts de Fays and was amusing himself in a\r\nsomewhat Yankee fashion of his by whittling small sticks with his\r\npenknife.\r\n\r\n\"The quarry is over there, away in the country,\" he said with the\r\nchaffing air he always took on when there was any question of hunting,\r\nwhich he detested. He had a way, when the sport was mentioned before\r\nhim, of defining it thus:\r\n\r\n\"A nice sort of amusement, indeed! I used to hunt once upon a time, to\r\nplease my father! You get fifty horsemen together. Everybody is got up\r\nin the smartest style. First of all there is a general kicking of\r\nhorses all round. All at once somebody shouts 'Found!' and in one\r\nminute every soul is covered with mud from head to foot. You tear along\r\nas hard as your horse can go for two hours without seeing a single\r\nthing. Then there is another whoop, and every soul goes home completely\r\nknocked up--a very fine amusement indeed!\"\r\n\r\nWe left the King to his little sticks, we killed our boar, and we were\r\non our way home, when, as we were going down the hill from Franchard, a\r\nHussar officer came galloping up to us, and called out:\r\n\r\n\"The King has been fired at. He's not hit.\"\r\n\r\nIf Providence ever watched over a man it did so that day. The would-be\r\nassassin, Lecomte, a royal forester who had resigned his place, angry\r\nbecause he had not been given the capital sum producing his pension,\r\ninstead of the pension itself, of which he was in receipt, and\r\noverexcited as well by the calumny, abuse, attacks, and threats of all\r\nkinds with which the daily press overwhelmed the King, had determined\r\nto kill his Majesty.\r\n\r\nHe was an excellent shot, and he went and built himself a platform\r\nbehind the wall of the Parquet d'Avon, by which he knew the King's char\r\na banes must pass. When the carriage went by, at a slow trot, ten paces\r\nfrom his ambush, he rested his rifle on the wall, and fired. But at the\r\nvery instant of the crime his hand must have trembled, for nobody was\r\ntouched, neither the orderly officer on duty, Captain Brahaut, who was\r\nriding between the King and the wall, nor Montalivet, who was sitting\r\ntalking to my father, on the front seat of the carriage, nor my mother,\r\nthe Duchesse de Nemours, my aunt Adelaide, and the Prince and Princess\r\nof Salerno, who were on the other seats. All the bullet did was to cut\r\nthe fringe of a sort of awning, which covered the carriage, just above\r\nthe King's head.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of the shot, the intended effect of which nobody mistook,\r\nthe two orderly officers, Brahaut and de Labadie, followed by Colonel\r\nBerryer, and several Hussar officers who were in attendance on the\r\nroyal party, dashed off at a gallop to surround the enclosure, before\r\nLecomte could escape from it. At the same moment, one of the grooms\r\nnamed Millet, who had brought his horse up against the wall, and stood\r\nup on his saddle, saw the assassin making off. He sprang boldly after\r\nhim, and had a fearful struggle with him till the officers came up to\r\nhis assistance.\r\n\r\nWhen I got back to my father and the Princesses, I found them much\r\ndistressed at this fresh attempt at regicide, but calm and\r\nself-possessed to an extent which was far from being my own case. So\r\ntrue is it that our sharpest anxieties are caused by the suffering, and\r\ndangers of those we love!\r\n\r\nAbout this period I was restored to active duty, being called to\r\ncommand our evolutionary squadron in the Mediterranean. During the two\r\nyears' duration of this command, I only had to follow in the footsteps\r\nof my predecessors, so far as the organisation and instruction of the\r\nships' crews were concerned, and the maintenance of that spirit of\r\ndiscipline, devotion, and obedience to superiors which still\r\nconstitutes their chief excellence.\r\n\r\nBut a new duty was cast upon me by the addition, now made for the first\r\ntime, of a certain number of steamships to the squadron. I had sailed\r\nalready with several squadrons. Whatever the number of ships composing\r\nthem, the manoeuvring of the vessels and their tactics, both in sailing\r\nand in action, all depended on one and the same element for all\r\nalike--viz., the strength and direction of the wind And these tactics,\r\nwhich were the result of centuries of experience, we all of us had put\r\ninto practice, and we had them at the tips of our fingers. We knew them\r\nas well as our catechism, in fact. But this new art of simultaneously\r\nnavigating ships for whom the laws of wind did not exist, and which\r\ncould move in any direction, and with great swiftness, according to the\r\nwill and fancy of their captains, without allowing them to collide, was\r\nin its earliest infancy.\r\n\r\nMy duty then was to make experiments, so as to begin to regulate this\r\nnew form of navigation. At once I set about making numerous test\r\nmanoeuvres, drawing on the tactics of the ancient galleys, and also on\r\ncavalry movements, at the slow march and at the gallop, for my\r\ninspiration. Then we tried towing in every form. First of all we\r\nharnessed a steamboat to every two warships. In the second year of my\r\ncommand each floating citadel had her own \"spare horse.\" From that time\r\nout calms and light breezes were vanquished, and the celerity of naval\r\noperations correspondingly increased. Yet, the more we tried it, the\r\nmore obviously did the dangers and difficulties caused, especially at\r\nnight, by fastening two ships together, one of whom is necessarily a\r\npassive agent, stare us in the face. The union of the tug and the\r\n\"towed\" was not far distant. The advent of the war steamer, the swift\r\nbattleship, independent alike of wind and sea, was close at hand.\r\n\r\nThe creation of such a ship had preoccupied M. Dupuy de Lome for a long\r\ntime past. He had gone to England to see and study everything\r\nthere--both in the State dockyards and the building yards at Liverpool\r\nand on the Clyde. We had often talked the whole thing over together,\r\nand our views on the subject were in perfect agreement. At last, during\r\nan interval of leave from my command, he came to me one morning with a\r\ngreat roll containing two complete designs under his arm. The first for\r\nan armed frigate, BUILT ENTIRELY OF IRON, the second for a wooden line\r\nof battle ship--both to be exceedingly swift. The first design, for the\r\niron frigate, was Dupuy de Lome's pet scheme.\r\n\r\n\"Iron-built ships will be the ships of the future,\" he used to say, and\r\nhe was quite right.\r\n\r\nBut the experiments we had been making at Lorient upon iron plates had\r\nbeen disastrous. The damage done by oblique firing on them was\r\nterrible. Experiments were indeed being made at the same time, with a\r\nview to armour-plating the hulls of ships, but all that was still in\r\nthe dimmest and mistiest future. How were we ever to induce naval\r\ncommittees, as timid as they were, undoubtedly, all powerful, to assent\r\nto the building of a steam frigate every single detail about which was\r\nto be new and improved?\r\n\r\n\"The very utmost we shall get,\" said I to Dupuy, \"will be leave to\r\nbuild your wooden ship. The introduction of the submerged steam\r\npropeller will be their concession to the innovators, and the\r\nold-fashioned wooden hull and spars and gundecks will satisfy the\r\nsupporters of the old traditions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" he replied, \"I'll go and propose my wooden ship.\"\r\n\r\nHe did, and he failed. They gave him plenty of smooth words and\r\ncompliments, but refused to order his ship to be put on the stocks. The\r\npoor fellow came back to me in despair, and we were mingling our\r\nsorrows, and casting about as to how we had better return to the\r\ncharge, when a lucky ministerial crisis threw the Ministry for Naval\r\nAffairs, ad interim, into the hands of M. Guizot. There we saw our\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nI want to see him and told him all our story--explaining to him how a\r\nreal and material step in naval progress was being adjourned on mere\r\nquestions of form; and how the outgoing minister had not dared, in\r\nspite of his own good-will, to shake himself free of administrative\r\nprocrastination in this particular.\r\n\r\nM. Guizot heard me out, and then asked me what had better be done.\r\n\r\n\"Why, simply take your own line, and the whole navy will applaud you.\r\nYou have full right to do it, so pray sign an order to put a steamship\r\nafter M. Dupuy de Lome's designs on the stocks.\"\r\n\r\nHe did it, forthwith, and that step gained, our first war steamer was\r\nat once begun. Though Dupuy had a right to all the honours of\r\npaternity, I might have claimed those of the ship's godfather. But she\r\nwas still unnamed when the Revolution of 1848 broke out, and christened\r\nher le 24 Fevner, which name was swiftly exchanged for that of\r\nNapoleon--a notion that makes me laugh even yet.\r\n\r\nI must now return to my personal recollections of my command, which\r\nbegan, as usual, with a sojourn at the Salins d'Hyeres, to knock the\r\ncrews into shape a bit. Thence I was expected to take the squadron to\r\nTunis, thus following the usual custom.\r\n\r\nThese two anchorages, Hyeres and Tunis, had been for a considerable\r\nperiod the only ports in which the squadron was allowed to lie. It\r\noscillated between the two; a most tiresome bit of navigation it was.\r\nIn the open roads at Tunis, too, we could only lie and roll, a long way\r\nfrom shore, with no possibility of giving our crews any relaxation\r\nwhatsoever. I do not hesitate to say that I objected to being tied to\r\nthis rigorously circumscribed field of operations, beyond which it\r\nlooked as if we dared not go.\r\n\r\n\"Crews,\" said I to the minister, \"are like schoolboys. If you want them\r\nto work well you must divert their minds, and give them something to\r\nthink about and look at. Give me leave to fight ennui, and the\r\ndespondency it brings with it, by taking the squadron about, showing\r\nfresh ground to my young fellows, and taking them into ports where I\r\nshall be able to send them ashore to amuse themselves, and thus break\r\nthe enervating monotony of life on board ship.\"\r\n\r\nI gained my point, and we went first of all to the Golfe Jouan. Will it\r\nbe believed that our squadrons never went near that excellent anchorage\r\nand lovely spot? They used to be at the Islands of Hyeres. They used to\r\ngo out to drill in the open sea, and every Saturday they went straight\r\nback to those same islands, so as to let the married men in the\r\nsquadron get back to Toulon to their family duties on the Sunday. I was\r\nthe first admiral to break through this rule.\r\n\r\nThe Golfe Jouan and Cannes, and all that lovely country, were not at\r\nthat time what they now are. There was only one single villa at Cannes,\r\nthe Villa Eleonore, built by Lord Brougham, the Christopher Columbus of\r\nthe locality. He always came to the Tuileries on his way backwards and\r\nforwards between his villa and England; and he invariably sang the\r\npraises of that exquisite coast to us. One evening he made a sketch of\r\nhis villa for my mother, which I still possess.\r\n\r\nThe only gaieties at Cannes in those days consisted in village\r\nfestivals, which are known in Provence as Romerages, the equivalent of\r\nthe Pardons in Brittany. People went to them on foot, there not being a\r\ncarriage in the country I remember I went to the Romerage at Valauris.\r\nThe little Provencales in their short petticoats and brown stockings,\r\nand their broad-brimmed black hats, enjoyed themselves to their hearts'\r\ncontent in the shade to the sound of the galoubet, while my eyes\r\nwandered between the umbrella pines across the wide sea horizon, of\r\nthat lapis-blue peculiar to the Mediterranean. It was more primitive\r\nthen than it is nowadays, but not a whit less lovely.\r\n\r\nFrom Cannes we were obliged to go to Tunis, but we put in, on our way,\r\nat the Balearic Islands, and at Palma in Majorca, where the Spanish\r\nauthorities gave us an excellent reception, and granted me permission,\r\nwith the best of grace, to practise some very interesting\r\ndisembarkation drill. The captain-general who authorised me to do this\r\nbore the name of Tacon, and had received the title of Duqtie de la\r\nUnion de Cuba in recognition of the services he had rendered as\r\ngovernor-general in that island.\r\n\r\nHe was a very superior man, under whose most enlightened, but at the\r\nsame time most absolute, of governments, the colony rose to the highest\r\ndegree of prosperity. Some difficulties with the Home Government had\r\nled to his recall, and he was at Majorca in a state of semi-disgrace.\r\nNo longer a young man, he wore a wig of the deepest black, which, so\r\nlocal tradition affirmed, was made out of the hair of a lady friend\r\nwhom he had had shaved in a fit of jealousy.\r\n\r\nThe King of Aragon, Don Jaime, is buried in the fine cathedral of Palma\r\nHis body rests in the sacristy, in the drawer of a kind of press, in\r\nwhich I saw it lying, while one of the canons, to impress me with a\r\nsense of its perfect preservation, drummed with his fingers on the\r\nstomach of the corpse!\r\n\r\nOn our way to the Balearic Islands we fulfilled a pious duty. After the\r\nunhappy capitulation of Baylen and its shameful violation, our\r\nunfortunate soldiers, victims of this piece of weakness and disloyalty,\r\nwere cast upon an island called Cabrera, a bare and desert spot, where\r\nmost of them died of hunger, abandoned and forgotten by the whole\r\nworld. Having heard that their bones were lying scattered about\r\nunburied on the isle, I had them laid in consecrated soil, and over\r\nthem, through the agency of our consul, M. Cabarrus, we raised a\r\nmonument, subscribed for by the whole squadron, with this inscription:\r\n\r\nTO THE MEMORY OF THE FRENCH SOLDIERS WHO DIED AT CABRERA.\r\n\r\n  ERECTED BY THE EVOLUTIONARY SQUADRON, 1847.\r\n\r\nWe made a short stay at the inevitable Tunis, and left it under a\r\nshower of presents, from the Order of the Nicham in diamonds to six\r\nthousand dozens of eggs. But the shortness in duration of our visit was\r\nnew, and requires some explanation.\r\n\r\nOne of our first cares, after the completion of our conquest of\r\nAlgeria, had been to insure tranquillity on its Moorish frontier to the\r\nwest, and its Tunisian boundary on the east. On the Morocco side we had\r\nbeen forced to have recourse to heavy ordnance for this purpose. On the\r\nTunisian frontier, where the population is both less fanatical and less\r\nwarlike, we had followed a different course of procedure. We had gained\r\nthe Bey's friendship by promising to support his power against the\r\nForte's claim to suzerainty over him. Still, year after year the Sultan\r\nmade as though he were fitting out a naval force to send to Tripoli and\r\nexercise this same suzerainty by deposing the Bey; and every year our\r\nsquadron used to proceed to Tunis, and stay there wasting its time\r\nwhile the Turkish ministry and those diplomats who were hostile to our\r\ninfluence amused themselves by waving the Capitan Pasha's attack before\r\nus like a scarecrow.\r\n\r\nThis annual repetition of a sham attack by the Turkish fleet and of the\r\nsudden despatch of our squadron, and its subsequent spell of idleness\r\nin Tunisian waters, had degenerated into a farce in which the\r\nridiculous part fell to our share. So that when I took over the command\r\nof the squadron, with the prospect of seeing it undergo the same course\r\nof humbug again, I could not resist making some representations on the\r\nsubject to M. Guizot, a resolute and large-minded man, as solicitous\r\nfor his country's honour as for his own. That very year, as it\r\nhappened, the Bey of Tunis had had to complain of intrigues and\r\ndisturbances stirred up on his eastern frontier by the Turkish pasha,\r\nwho was governor of Tripoli.\r\n\r\n\"Instead of leaving the squadron to dance attendance at Tunis,\" I said\r\nto M. Guizot, \"send it to Tripoli. Its appearance will cause surprise,\r\nfor foreign powers never send their squadrons there. I will pay a visit\r\nto the pasha, and speak to him very plainly. The characters in the play\r\nwill change hands, and I fancy we shall be rid of all this\r\nTurko-Diplomatic teasing about Tunis for the future.\"\r\n\r\nM. Guizot approved my view. I was given secret orders to go to Tripoli,\r\nand we left Tunis, to the delight of the whole squadron.\r\n\r\nLong before the coast of Tripoli is in sight, its whereabouts is\r\ndenoted by the gloomy red reflection it casts upon the sky. Soon a few\r\nclumps of date-palms seem to rise out of the water, and at last a\r\ndreary strip of land appears, the uniform straightness of which is\r\nbroken only by the mass of white houses and terraces, the minarets and\r\nfortifications, of the town of Tripoli. A few reefs form a far from\r\nsafe anchorage, fit for small craft only, and remarkable for the\r\nextraordinary clearness of the water in it. The smallest details of\r\nsubmarine life are easily followed in a depth of ten to twelve fathoms.\r\n\r\nOur ships, which all drew a great deal of water, had to anchor at sea,\r\nopposite the town, tossed about on the swell from a storm somewhere to\r\nthe north, which did not actually reach them. Our sudden, unexpected,\r\nand very unusual apparition made a certain sensation both at the\r\nconsulates and in the pasha's palace, and all sorts of people hastened\r\non board, very civil all of them, but also very anxious to know the\r\nmeaning of the visit of a complete naval squadron. The pasha's deputy\r\npresented himself with a flood of the honeyed expressions demanded by\r\nOriental politeness, accompanied by the classical diffa. He did not\r\nbring us six thousand dozens of eggs, like the Tunis people; indeed\r\nthey would have been hard to get, I think, in that little favoured\r\nspot, but he brought a very respectable contingent of cackling hens and\r\nof very sea-sick sheep. Our acceptance of these creatures, an earnest\r\nof our pacific intentions, gave him evident satisfaction, and I caused\r\nhim to be told that I should ask for an interview with his master,\r\nthrough our consul.\r\n\r\nI set forth, as soon as the said interview had been arranged, with a\r\nlarge number of officers. The streets through which we had to pass were\r\nnarrow, dirty, and wretched-looking, and did not give one at all the\r\nidea of belonging to a town enriched by the commerce of Fezzan and of\r\nCentral Africa, of which commerce Tripoli is the chief emporium. They\r\nwere crowded, as we passed along, by curious lookers on, consisting\r\nprincipally of the three thousand idlers who formed the garrison,\r\nAlbanian Arnauts most of them, splendid fellows, blue-eyed, with long\r\nfair moustaches, dressed in the fustanella and the rest of the\r\npicturesque palikare costume. I will not go so far as to say the\r\nglances they cast at us were absolutely friendly, but they were\r\nperfectly well behaved.\r\n\r\nWe climbed up numerous staircases to the pasha's house or Konak, and\r\nwere shown into a huge apartment that was almostlike the open air, with\r\nlarge windows looking on the sea, which admitted a cool refreshing\r\nbreeze. The pasha made me sit down beside him on a wide divan, and\r\nafter the usual interchange of compliments, pipes, coffee, and\r\npreserves were ceremoniously handed round by numerous servants.\r\n\r\nThese preliminaries over, I desired the dragoman to request the pasha's\r\nearnest attention to what I was about to say to him. Immediately there\r\nwas a general silence, all our officers, who filled one half of the\r\nroom, and all the Turkish officers and secretaries, who filled the\r\nother half, pricked up their ears. My speech was very short.\r\n\r\nWe had come to Tripoli, I said, to salute the representative of our\r\nancient ally, the Sultan of Turkey. But it was ESSENTIAL, if this\r\nfriendship was to be undisturbed, that no act of hostility, direct or\r\nindirect, should be committed against the Bey of Tunis, who was also\r\nour ally, and that nothing should occur on either side to compromise\r\nfriendly relations. We had just been impressing this fact at Tunis, and\r\nhad come to clo the same thing at Tripoli. The perfectly amicable\r\nnature of our visit proved the value we set on maintaining friendly\r\nrelations between the two Regencies, and therefore between France and\r\nthe Sultan's Government.\r\n\r\nI said no more. When I ceased speaking, the pasha, who, I need scarcely\r\nsay, had preserved the most Oriental imperturbability of countenance\r\nduring my oration, bowed to me, with his hand on his breast, looking\r\nfixedly at me the while. He had understood me; and I thought I saw a\r\nlook of relief flash across his face. It may be that his conscience had\r\nmade him fear worse things. He sent a vessel to Malta with despatches\r\nfor Constantinople. I gave an account of my proceedings to M. Guizot,\r\nand also informed our ambassador to the Porte, M. de Bourqueney; but we\r\nnever had to do sentry duty at Tunis again.\r\n\r\nI put to sea at once with the squadron. The tiresome thing about our\r\nvisit to Tripoli was the quarantine it entailed on us when we got back\r\nto civilised coasts. With the object of utilising the period of our\r\nenforced sequestration, I requested the governor of Malta to put health\r\nofficers on board us, and to allow me to count the ten days I proposed\r\nspending under their surveillance, cruising about within sight of the\r\nisland, as quarantine.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement was accepted by the English authorities, with their\r\nusual friendliness and practical good sense. The ten days were spent in\r\ndrill and manoeuvres of all sorts; and then the squadron went to seek\r\nrelaxation on the coasts of Sicily and Naples.\r\n\r\nWe made most agreeable stays in the ports of Syracuse, Augusta, and\r\nMessina, before going to Naples. I took advantage of them to gratify my\r\npassion for mountaineering, and made the ascent of Etna, to the\r\ndescription of which by Alexandre Dumas I refer my readers.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the summit, during the night, we saw the immense crater\r\nat our feet, several thousand yards round, full of fire and smoke, out\r\nof which huge stone monoliths towered, of every shade of colour, black\r\nand green and red and yellow. Then the rising sun fell on us, leaving\r\nall the horizon around us in darkness, and when at last its light had\r\nspread everywhere, save on the giant shadow of the mountain itself, we\r\nsaw all Sicily and Calabria lying at our feet like a great map, with\r\nthe blue sea surrounding it on every side. It was a grand and striking\r\nspectacle.\r\n\r\nWe descended the mountain rapidly, ten yards at a jump, down the\r\ncrumbly pumice slopes of the Val de Bove, to Giarre, where one of the\r\nsteamers of the squadron was to take us on board; and while we waited\r\nfor her we took a delicious sea bath. We swam out to meet the ship, and\r\nI was much tickled by the astonishment of the commander, enthroned upon\r\nhis bridge, when he heard himself hailed out of the sea by a well-known\r\nvoice, telling him to stop.\r\n\r\nThe squadron happened to be at Messina on the 15th of August, the day\r\nof the Barra Festival, which takes place in honour both of the\r\nAssumption of the Virgin and of the entry of Count Roger into Messina,\r\nafter he had defeated the Saracens. As far as concerned beauty and\r\nlocal colour, the festival, which in those particulars yields to none\r\nsave that of St. Rosalia at Palermo, was most interesting. But one\r\ndetail there was which filled me with horror--the sight of an immense\r\ncar, dragged along by a crowd of, wild enthusiasts, laden from top to\r\nbottom with saints, virgins, and angels, represented, for the nonce, by\r\nyoung people of both sexes, the whole thing surmounted, at a great\r\nheight above it, by a huge sun with gilded rays. So far there was\r\nnothing to complain of. But when the car moved along, the rays of the\r\nsun, by an ingenious mechanism, turned as well; and at the end of each\r\nof these rays a poor little brat, dressed like a cherub, and crowned\r\nwith roses, had been hung, in a sort of fireman's belt, by its\r\nbarbarous parents. The tortures of the poor little creatures, hanging\r\nthus by their middles, under a burning sun, and shaken up by every jolt\r\nthe machine gave as it turned, may be imagined.\r\n\r\nBy the time the abominable thing came past my window, amidst singing\r\nand band-playing and cheering, most of the poor children were swinging\r\nunconscious from the rays of the great sun which jolted heavily at\r\nevery turn it made. It was a disgusting sight; but we were the only\r\npeople to notice it and be shocked by it.\r\n\r\nWhile at Naples, I was ordered to go to Rome to congratulate the new\r\nPope, Pius the Ninth, whose election had just taken place, in the name\r\nof France. I started off at once, by Civita Vecchia, and reached the\r\npalace of our embassy at Rome at night. At dawn a great noise made me\r\nhastily open my window, anxious to know the reason of the uproar, and\r\nalso to get a first look at the Eternal City, where I was for the first\r\ntime in my life. It was raining, and the inhabitants of all the\r\nadjacent houses, as well as the soldiers in the barracks over the way,\r\nwere all shouting at the top of their voices Acqua! Acqua! Acqua! It\r\nsounded as if every cockatoo in Australia had settled upon the papal\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThe rain had been long in its coming, it appears. But my first\r\nimpression of Rome was not a very inspiring one. And, indeed, I had\r\nlittle opportunity of getting any others.\r\n\r\nTo mark the fact that I had come to the city solely on the Pope's\r\naccount, I only stayed two days, so that I saw nothing except the Pope\r\nhimself, or I rushed by everything else I was shown so hurriedly, that\r\nit came to the same thing. During those forty-eight hours I was the\r\nsole property of our embassy, and I could not have been in better\r\nhands. We had representatives who were worthy of the name, in those\r\ndays,--real diplomats.\r\n\r\nThe ambassador was M. Rossi, my former teacher, a man of generous\r\nfeeling and high intelligence, who was soon to be the victim of one of\r\nthe most cowardly crimes ever perpetrated by the revolutionary tribe.\r\nThe secretary to the embassy was the present Due de Broglie. By these\r\ntwo gentlemen I was conducted into the Pope's presence. Being very\r\nignorant of the proper ceremonial to follow, I asked M. Rossi what I\r\nwas to call his Holiness.\r\n\r\n\"Tres chaint Pere, ou cha Chaintete,\" he answered, with an accent which\r\nI took good care not to imitate.\r\n\r\nHaving gone past the fine Swiss Guard, in their sixteenth-century\r\ndress, and their officer in helmet and cuirass, and then past the\r\nGuardia Nobile, and a huge staff of ecclesiastics in violet robes, I\r\nbent low before the sovereign pontiff, and kissed his ring with deep\r\nemotion. Raising my eyes, I saw a handsome old man, tall in stature,\r\nwith a kind face, dressed all in white, to whom I delivered the message\r\nof which I was the bearer. At that moment I had a glimpse of a fair\r\ndream, which M. Rossi endeavoured to realise at a later date. It was to\r\nmake a close alliance between France and a Confederation of all the\r\nItalian States--our allies already by relationship between the reigning\r\nfamilies, or by community of interest of all kinds--under the\r\nprotectorate of the Pope, at once our devoted friend and the head of\r\nthe Catholic religion all over the whole world. But the fair dream was\r\nnever to come true. Its patriotic promoter, M. Rossi, fell under the\r\nassassin's hand, and every passion--revolutionary, anti-religious, and\r\nanti-French--joined hands to make it fail. In its place we have Italian\r\nunity and a dethroned Pope.\r\n\r\nAfter a pleasant evening at the embassy, with Cardinal Gizzi,\r\nMonsignore de Falloux, the Princes and Princesses of the Massimo\r\nfamily, and a very charming young lady, Princess Rospigliosi, sister to\r\na naval cadet attached to my staff, named Champagny, who afterwards\r\nbecame the Due de Cadore, I returned to Naples by the Pontine Marshes\r\nand Terracina, where the strains of Auber's Fra Diavolo kept springing\r\nto my lips.\r\n\r\nThe squadron remained in Neapolitan waters until the festival of Pie di\r\nGrotta, on which occasion the King took me with him to a great review\r\nhe held--a very noisy and lively scene it was--in the Toledo, the great\r\nartery of the town, with its picturesque vistas on to Vesuvius. The\r\nNational Guard was of modern growth, and lamentable at that. Then came\r\nthe regular army, and especially four Swiss regiments with their\r\nartillery, a magnificent division of troops. As long as they are here,\r\nI said to myself, there need be no fear of revolutions. But just\r\nbecause their valour and fidelity promised a reception little to the\r\ntaste of the sedition-mongers, those prudent modern condottieri were\r\nwaving their warlike pens, and loudly demanding the disembodiment of\r\nthese very regiments. It pained me to notice the icy reception given to\r\nthe brave fellows as they marched past, and I could not help feeling a\r\ngloomy foreboding.\r\n\r\nThat sheet anchor of the Neapolitan Monarchy was destroyed before long\r\nby one of those compromises with rebellion so frequent in these\r\ndays--disastrous proceedings, which inevitably lead the way by their\r\nevil and demoralising example, to other compromises, infinitely more\r\nlamentable, alas!--I mean compromise with a foreign enemy.\r\n\r\nAt the time when I bore the King company at that review it was not his\r\nSwiss regiments alone who were the object of the agitators' fury, but\r\nhis government and his own person as well. A sort of general conspiracy\r\nagainst them was brewing, fomented for the most part by foreign agents,\r\nsome of them actually diplomats, who thus openly abused the immunity\r\ntheir functions gave them; and it was propagated by means of the secret\r\nsocieties which are an endemic plague in Italian countries. King and\r\nGovernment alike fought as best they could against the current of\r\nrevolution, and they did so rightly, in the general interest, for\r\nrevolution brings nothing but ruin in its train.\r\n\r\nBut beside the adventurers who shrank from no crime, and who preached\r\nassassination and plunder, there stood many honourable and enlightened\r\nNeapolitans, who desired the reform of abuses (and God knows there were\r\nplenty of them!) and the progressive amelioration of the moral and\r\nmaterial conditions of existence. Unhappily it was on these men, whose\r\nsole offence lay in their opinions, that the brutality, and I might add\r\nthe horrors, of the repressive measures adopted seemed by preference to\r\nfall. The prisons of those days, in which they were confined, were\r\nperfect dens, and I greatly fear they are much the same all over Italy\r\neven now. I doubt, for instance, that the convict prison at Pescara\r\nwould yield in the matter of abominations to the convict prison at\r\nNisida, some forty years ago.\r\n\r\nWhen peoples who have long lived in a state of backwardness, have a\r\nsudden fit of cleanliness, in imitation of more advanced nations, they\r\nare apt to clean the outside walls only, and to leave all their\r\naccustomed filth hidden behind them. I mention these terrible prisons\r\nbecause, during the visit of the squadron to Naples, I was guilty of\r\nsnatching two distinguished men, both much sought after by the police\r\non account of the offensive opinions I have already spoken of, from\r\ntheir clutches. M. Lutteroth, the secretary to our embassy, went and\r\nfetched them at night from their hiding-place, and I put them on board\r\none of my ships, which was sailing at once for Tunis. I have no\r\nrecollection of their names. And indeed that was not the only instance\r\nin which we saved people compromised in Italian politics, out of sheer\r\nhumanity. Long after the incident of which I speak, a Piedmontese\r\nofficer, who performed brilliant services in our African army, side by\r\nside with my brothers, begged Aumale to put him into communication with\r\nour mother. He then conjured her, as a woman and a Neapolitan, to save\r\na prisoner, who was seriously compromised (whether his relative or his\r\nfriend I no longer recollect), from the gallows, and my mother wrote a\r\nmost pressing letter to King Ferdinand at his request. The King, who\r\nhad always preserved the tenderest and most respectful affection for\r\nhis aunt, and glad also, I make no doubt (for he was a kind man), to\r\nhave an opportunity of setting mercy above arguments of state, granted\r\nmy mother the pardon she craved. The name of the man thus spared was\r\nNicotera.\r\n\r\nThis taken for granted, as they say in mathematics, I hie me back to my\r\nsquadron at Spezzia, a splendid bay, which at that time we were the\r\nonly people to use as an anchorage, but in which the Italians have now\r\nestablished a great naval arsenal. The bay is very safe and convenient\r\nfor drill and practice. But I have one fault to find with it. I never\r\ntook my ships there without an epidemic of influenza colds breaking\r\nout, and affecting three or four hundred men in each crew. These\r\noutbreaks are due, in my opinion, to the high wooded mountains which\r\nshadow the bay on the western side, and to its sudden transitions from\r\nthe most scorching sunshine to very cool shade. Our ships attracted\r\nseveral tourists, and one morning I saw a party appear on board,\r\nconsisting, amongst other people, of the Marquis de Boissy, a witty and\r\nrestless French peer, married to the Comtesse Giuccioli, of Byronian\r\nmemory, and of the Marquis Oldoini, accompanied by an exquisite young\r\nlady, his daughter, who afterwards became that superb beauty, the\r\nComtesse de Castiglione.\r\n\r\nM. de Boissy tried to talk politics to me and to reiterate the famous\r\nphrase \"Be strong.\" But whenever anybody began to talk to me about\r\nquestions of home politics, with which I had nothing to do, my partial\r\ndeafness always became complete.\r\n\r\nMore cruising and manoeuvring carried the squadron over to Algiers,\r\nwhich it reached in June, 1847, just when Marshal Bugeaud was giving up\r\nhis position as governor-general of the colony. We rendered him\r\nviceregal honours at his departure, and I can still see his grand white\r\nhead, as he stood uncovered on the bridge of the ship which bore him\r\naway, and passed slowly between the lines of warships, with their\r\ncannon thundering, drums rolling, bands playing the Marseillaise, and\r\ncrews cheering wildly. He left that Algerian territory, which he had so\r\nlargely contributed to acquire to France, with a sad heart, and for\r\never. But the European horizon was darkening, serious events were\r\nevidently pending, and if war was to result fiom them, France would\r\nhave had, in the person of the soldier we were thus saluting, a general\r\nwhom all, without exception, would have served with equal devotion and\r\nabsolute confidence. To us Frenchmen, this confidence in our leader,\r\nwhich emboldens every one, and suppresses all doubt and hesitation, is\r\nhalf the battle. It was possessed, and completely, not by Bugeaud\r\nhimself alone--all his lieutenants had acquired it. During fifteen\r\nyears of fighting and of detached expeditions, in which they had all,\r\nturn about, held independent commands, both officers and soldiers had\r\nbeen able to gauge their valour, their intelligence, and that capacity\r\nfor bearing the weight of undivided responsibility, which is the great\r\ntest of a commander-in-chief. The advantage thus gained was immense.\r\nBut are we sure the country got the benefit of all the services which\r\nthis band of soldiers, consecrated already by the opinion of their\r\nmilitary compeers, might have rendered her? Was it not rather scattered\r\nto the winds by the ruinous action of political forces?\r\n\r\nI took advantage of the squadron's visit to Algiers to make an\r\nexcursion to Boghar, on the desert frontier. This expedition was both\r\ninteresting and amusing. My first day's stage took me to Blidah, into\r\nwhich place I made the quaintest entry, surrounded by all the\r\nauthorities, who had come out as far as the monument to Sergeant\r\nBlandan to meet me I had not travelled a hundred paces among these\r\ngentlemen before the frankest cordiality began to exist between me and\r\nthem. Colonel Claparede, on my right, with whom this meeting was my\r\nfirst, was asking me if I had ever been fool enough to fall in love;\r\nColonel Baville, of the Chasseurs d'Afrique, on my left, whose face was\r\nalso a new one to me, was inquiring whether I did not agree with him\r\nthat children were born with extraordinary rapidity in the African\r\nclimate, while Bourbaki, the secretary of the Arab office, was\r\nperforming the wildest fantasia in front of us at the head of the\r\nHadjout Goum.\r\n\r\nAt Medeah, whither I went by the Mouzai'a Pass, so as to see the scene\r\nof the fights in which my brothers had played such a noble part, I had\r\nanother reception, and another fantasia was performed (but this time it\r\nwas on foot), by the Coulouglis and the Beni Mzab, wearing great hats\r\nwith ostrich feathers in them. Then came a grotesque imitation of the\r\nfantasia, performed by the colonial militia, all drunk, who fired their\r\npistols off under my nose and blackened my face with powder. General\r\nMarey, commanding at Medeah, owned the Romance vintage in Burgundy, and\r\ngave us some to drink at dinner, which did not diminish the general\r\ncordiality. Ah, well! a glass of good French wine, drunk far from home\r\nand the dissensions of the mother country, among comrades ready to give\r\ntheir lives for her at any moment, is a thing worth remembering!\r\n\r\nBoghar, hideous and scorchingly hot as it is, would be downright\r\nuninhabitable if it were not washed by the waters of the Cheliff. The\r\nnecessities arising from our conquest of the country had made it a\r\nrevictualling post for our columns, and a trial had just been made\r\nthere of a new sort of provision, described as rations maigres. These\r\nconsisted of biscuit and dried cod, and not having been issued within\r\nthe period reckoned for, they were beginning to go bad. To avoid\r\nfinancial loss, a pretty numerous garrison had been at once despatched\r\nto Boghar to perform the far from pleasant duty of consuming them.\r\nThanks to the exertions of the officer in command, M. de Monet, who\r\nafterwards attained the rank of general, and lost both his arms in the\r\nCrimea, the spirit of his men was admirable, but their sanitary\r\ncondition was quite deplorable. And when I received the officers, one\r\nof them, a captain of Engineers, with the tacit assent of his chief,\r\nacted as the mouthpiece of the rest in begging me to raise my voice to\r\nput an end to their cruel sufferings. He represented to me that the\r\nunhealthiness of the place was aggravated by a process of poisoning.\r\nThe troops had been sent up simply to eat damaged biscuit and stinking\r\ncod. There was no other food issued for the men, and as the\r\nneighbourhood produced nothing whatever, it was impossible to vary it\r\nin any way. Everybody was more or less ill in consequence, and if this\r\nstate of things went on they must all die. A distinguished officer, M.\r\nde Cissey, who had been detailed as my aide-de-camp during my trip,\r\ntook the poor fellows' case in hand, and undertook to lay their\r\ncomplaint before the general.\r\n\r\nI saw something else at Boghar which was not so depressing--another\r\nfantasia, a huge one, performed by thousands of Arabs, who had hastened\r\nin from all quarters. At the very height of the show, another tribe,\r\nthe most picturesque of them all, the Ouled-Nails, arrived on the\r\nscene, having travelled thirty leagues to do homage to me as the \"son\r\nof the Sultan.\" There were 1,500 horsemen and their wives, who were\r\ncarried by something like a hundred camels in a kind of palanquin,\r\ncovered with gaudy stuffs, which they call \"atatich.\" When they\r\narrived, the excitement of the fantasia rose to madness. The horsemen\r\nfrom the south, in their splendid dresses, showed off all their skill,\r\nand whenever one of them performed any specially brilliant feat, the\r\ndeafening \"you-you\" of the women rose from the circle of palanquins as\r\nfrom the benches of a circus.\r\n\r\nThe background of this eminently picturesque scene, under the blazing\r\neastern sun, was the wide horizon of the mountains of Bou Cada and\r\nTaguin, amongst which my brother Aumale captured Abd-el-Kadir's smalah.\r\n\r\nOn my way back from Boghar I paid a visit to the military works at the\r\nChiffa Gorge, where the 33rd Regiment of the Line was building a\r\nwonderful road, under circumstances of the utmost danger and\r\ndifficulty; and I returned from my tour in Africa feeling deeper\r\nadmiration and respect than ever for our soldiers, who are as patient\r\nunder hardship, and as plucky when they have to work in dangerous\r\nplaces, as they are brave in actual battle.\r\n\r\nLeaving Algiers, the squadron continued its cruise. We were a great\r\ndeal at sea, much more than is feasible nowadays, when it costs\r\nsomething considerable in fuel to go the smallest distance. We anchored\r\none evening in a Sardinian bay, where nobody ever stopped by any\r\nchance, but which offered a pleasant resting-place for the night at\r\nthat fine season.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, I gave the officers leave to go ashore. They found a\r\nperfect desert, and any houses they came upon barricaded; but though\r\nhuman inhabitants were lacking, there was an incredible amount of game.\r\nHares swarmed upon the ground. At last one inhabitant turned up, and\r\nthen some others, and friendly relations were established.\r\n\r\nThe population, it appeared, had fled at our approach, taking us (I am\r\nnot joking, truly) for Barbary Moors, coming to make a raid for slaves.\r\nInformation travels slowly in those parts.\r\n\r\nWe went to Cagliari, Palermo, Leghorn, Spezzia, and Genoa in\r\nsuccession, and then the squadron returned to winter at Toulon. The\r\nperiod of my command had run out save for these winter months. Being\r\nmuch overworked, and far from well, I applied to be relieved of my\r\nfunctions, and on the 26th November I made them over to Admiral\r\nTrehouard, who had commanded one of the divisions under my orders.\r\nTrehouard was a brave Breton, who had performed a splendid feat during\r\nan action at Obligado in La Plata, where he commanded the French\r\nportion of an Anglo-French flotilla, sent to force its way up the\r\nriver, which was blocked by a boom and defended by a number of forts.\r\nThe little fleet met with an energetic and obstinate resistance.\r\nSeveral ships had been put hors de combat, including Trehouard's own,\r\nwhich was disabled and had half her crew on shore. The struggle lasted\r\non still, and threatened to end in our defeat, when Captain Hope,\r\ncommanding the English contingent, ordered out his boats, and went and\r\ncut through the boom under a hail of bullets, while Trehouard boarded\r\nthe last ship he had that was able to move, and ordered her commander,\r\nM. de Miniac, who lost his leg at St. Juan d'Ulloa, to run her ashore\r\nclose to the enemy's principal battery.\r\n\r\nAfter a momentary struggle, and in spite of the Argentine officers'\r\nshouts of \"Fuego al pelo blanco!\" (Fire at the white head!), (Trehouard\r\nwas prematurely gray), on the quarterdeck; the moral and physical\r\nresult of the hand-to-hand struggle ended in a complete rout of the\r\nenemy. Trehouard was made a rear-admiral, and no man ever deserved his\r\nstep better.\r\n\r\nA young officer was killed beside him that day whose name was Hello.\r\nHis father, a friend of mine, had put him under my wing when he left\r\nthe Naval College, and I had watched over his career with sincere\r\naffection for several years. Every time I pass one of the commonplace\r\nstatues placed in our public squares in memory of political chatterers\r\nwho have died quietly in their beds, I think of all those brave fellows\r\nwho have died obscurely for their country, with no funeral oration but\r\nthe tears of their broken-hearted families, but who have carried away\r\nto their eternal dwelling-place the proud consolation of duty performed.\r\n\r\nI returned to Paris. What a state of things was there! Politics had\r\noverwhelmed everything else. To the lovers of order, who had already\r\nfound their condition oppressive, the state of affairs was soon to\r\nbecome fatal. The makers of sedition, on the other hand, found it most\r\nblessed. But to the country at large, as events have too surely proved,\r\nit was disastrous.\r\n\r\nI will not dwell too long on this sad period, my personal recollections\r\nof which are mingled with the events of a well-known page of our\r\nnational history.\r\n\r\nTowards the beginning of the winter of 1848 the doctors ordered my\r\nwife, who was in very delicate health, to go and spend the cold months\r\nin a southern climate, and I started with her and my children for\r\nAlgiers, where I joined my brother Aumale, who had become\r\ngovernor-general of the colony. I arrived, weighed down with gloomy\r\nforebodings, feeling convinced that by dint of trying to respect those\r\nso-called legal restraints which paralyse a government, but which do so\r\nlittle to hinder any revolutionary section in its action, we should end\r\nby being overwhelmed, and by hearing the fatal hour strike, the \"too\r\nlate\" that comes with every revolution. Yet I did not believe that hour\r\nso close at hand as it was. For I had hardly settled down at Algiers,\r\nwhen one fine morning the announcement of the February revolution and\r\nthe proclamation of the republic came upon us like the bursting of a\r\nshell. The news arrived in the shape of vague rumours, uncertain\r\ninformation, reports of various kinds, brought over from Marseilles. As\r\nto the amount of authenticity they possessed--whether the movement was\r\na general one or confined to Paris only, whether a stand was being made\r\nagainst it anywhere--on all these points the earliest rumours were\r\nmute, and they were just as silent as to what had befallen the King and\r\nthe rest of our family, in the confusion. We were reduced to the\r\nwildest conjectures, and were wondering whether we ought not to start\r\nfor France at once, when a steam corvette from Toulon brought me the\r\nfollowing despatch:--\r\n\r\nThe Minister for Naval Affairs to Monsieur le Prince de Joinville.\r\n\r\n28th February, 1848, 8.30 p.m.\r\n\r\nPrince,\r\n\r\nThe well-being of the country demands that you should make no attempt\r\nto dissuade the crews or soldiers of the navy from their obedience to\r\nthe Provisional Government. It is important that you should not attempt\r\nto set foot on French soil, nor communicate with any vessel in the\r\nFrench fleet, till further orders.\r\n\r\nPrince, your patriotic instinct will enable you to resign yourself to\r\nthis sacrifice, and to perform it unflinchingly. Such is the confident\r\nhope of the Provisional Government.        ARAGO.\r\n\r\nThe signatory of this despatch had taught me in my youth, and I had\r\nkept up affectionate intercourse with him since. But the coolness with\r\nwhich the man (a great savant, no doubt, but who up to this had never\r\ndone anything but make calculations and handle telescopes) invested\r\nhimself with supreme authority amazed me. Exasperated as I was by his\r\nsummons \"to make no attempt to dissuade the sailors and soldiers of the\r\nnavy from their obedience\" to his hour-old government, in other words,\r\nfrom the violation of their oath which he was about to ask of all the\r\nbrave fellows, I forgot both my former relations with the man and the\r\ncourteous form of his despatch; and I was in a transport of rage as I\r\nhanded the missive to Changarnier, commanding the troops, and M.\r\nVaisse, the civil secretary-general, who were both of them present, in\r\nmy brother's study.\r\n\r\n\"That is a summons from the enemy,\" I said; \"we must do the very\r\ncontrary.\"\r\n\r\nBut M. Vai'sse was silent, and Changarnier shook his head. I bethought\r\nme then, alas! that in this day of progress of ours the religion of a\r\nman's oath is but an empty word--and I recovered my self-possession.\r\n\r\nMy aide-de-camp, Commander Touchard, had come from Paris by the same\r\ncorvette that had brought me the despatch. He had seen the crash, had\r\nbeen present when the National Guard, upon whom my brother Nemours had\r\ncalled to resist the rioters, had overwhelmed him with abuse, had\r\nwitnessed the abdication, the scenes in the Chamber, and the King's\r\nfinal departure. All the way across France, too, except at Toulon,\r\nwhere the strong hand of the navy made itself felt, Touchard had\r\nwatched the eager speculations of the majority on the accomplished\r\nfact, and the struggle as to who should first offer his services to the\r\nProvisional Government, before the corpse of Constitutional Monarchy\r\nwas cold--for dead it was, without having struck a blow in its own\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about the King's personal courage. He had proved it\r\non many battle-fields--at Valmy, Jemmapes, and Nerwinde--and under the\r\nfrequent attempts made on him by would-be assassins. With courage of a\r\nrarer kind, he had never hesitated to brave unpopularity, when his\r\ndoing so was clearly to the country's interest. But he had striven,\r\nbeing honest as well as brave, to be faithful to the institutions he\r\nhad sworn to maintain, although those who opposed him had long ceased\r\nto respect the fiction of the constitution, and had become a frankly\r\nrevolutionist body, which no longer directed its attack against the\r\nministry of the day, but against the King's own person, and all that\r\nedifice on the summit of which the throne was placed.\r\n\r\nHad he chosen to take the initiative, in order to prevent what\r\nultimately happened, he would not have failed for want of means. When\r\nthe army and the administration are in a man's hands, he can do very\r\nmuch as he chooses. Successive revolutions have destroyed all respect\r\namong us, except respect for main force; and it is a true saying that\r\nif strength begets respect, respect in its turn begets affection. But\r\nthe King, who was the most moderate of men, would not go beyond legal\r\nlimits except as a last resource. And this characteristic of his was\r\nwell and universally known to all, both to friends and foes. While it\r\ndiscouraged the former, it to some extent encouraged the latter, and so\r\nthe signal for recourse to force came from below, the pretorians of the\r\nstreet rose in rebellion, and the defenders of the law were everywhere\r\novercome. In a few moments the confusion became general, and the\r\nrevolution was an accomplished fact.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, even so late in the day, in other countries than our own\r\nindeed, generals, and others invested with the chief command of the\r\nnational troops, have been known to draw their swords and save their\r\nsovereigns and their governments almost in spite of their own selves.\r\nThey have been known to maintain the tutelary and inviolable principle\r\nof a traditional monarchy--a principle which is both ancient and\r\nabsolute, tracing the line of duty for all men, clear and indisputable,\r\nwithout any possibility of hesitation or compromise--against and in the\r\nface of all comers. And this principle is one which calls forth the\r\nproudest devotion, seeing it is impersonal, for the king is not the\r\nelected leader of conquerors, oppressing the conquered, but a living\r\nflag, the national rallying-point for all the defenders of the mother\r\ncountry against her enemies, whether within or without her borders.\r\n\r\nThis saving process, whether the saved ones would or no, has been seen,\r\nas I say, in other countries, which thus were preserved from that\r\ndiscord, disorganisation, and disaster of every kind, which are the\r\ninevitable consequence of internal convulsion and revolution.\r\n\r\nBut the July Monarchy was unhappily very far from representing the\r\ntraditional hereditary principle. Born of one insurrection, it was\r\noverthrown by another. Set up on the electoral principle, it fell, as\r\nthough in mockery, with a full electoral majority behind it.\r\nTwo-and-twenty years later the empire too fell, on the very morrow of a\r\ntriumphant plebiscite. Partial and universal suffrage alike have proved\r\ntheir impotence to defend a government which has ceased to give\r\nsatisfaction against the assaults of that army shouting \"Get out of\r\nthat and let me take your place!\" the members of which always make\r\nthemselves up as austere patriots. And I cannot help, in this place,\r\nlooking sadly back at the fatal consequences which this impotence of\r\nthe elective, as compared with the monarchical regime, has had for us.\r\nWhy did the Emperor refuse to treat with M. de Bismarck in the name of\r\nFrance, when he met him, on the evening of Sedan, and asked him to do\r\nso? Why did the unfortunate prince not do the same as two sovereigns in\r\npossession of hereditary rights and duties, Victor Emmanuel after\r\nNovara, and Francis Joseph after Sadowa, who both of them safeguarded\r\ntheir territory and the honour of their armies? Because he was a\r\nbastard sovereign--and dared not reappear before his electors once he\r\nwas beaten.\r\n\r\nBut to return to my story, to which I have but a few lines to add. The\r\nrevolution might have been foreseen and the days of the government of\r\n1830 might have been prolonged. Once it was overthrown, and the dyke\r\nwhich stemmed the torrent of democracy carried away, its rule, which\r\nwas one of chance convenience and not of right, had no further reason\r\nfor existence.\r\n\r\nThat being so, what was I to do? The re-establishment of the legitimate\r\nfamily on the throne was out of the question. The disasters of our\r\nfirst revolutionary period had not as yet been renewed in their\r\nterrible logical sequence. We had not yet had our second Waterloo at\r\nSedan, and very few people thought at that moment of coming back to the\r\nprinciple the proof of whose title lies in the centuries of unity and\r\ngreatness assured by it to France--the one and only principle capable\r\nof checking her on her descent into the abyss of dismemberment,\r\ndepopulation, and social destruction, down which she is gliding.\r\n\r\nIt was clear that another elective regime was about to succeed the one\r\nwhich had just collapsed--one of those modern edifices, all, whatever\r\nmay be the name with which they are decorated, tainted with the same\r\noriginal weakness--\"What the majority has made, the majority has the\r\nright to unmake.\" In fact--as somebody said in a speech--a perpetually\r\nprovisional arrangement Under these ephemeral forms of rule, our\r\nnational inferiority in face of other stable and far-sighted\r\ngovernments is flagrantly evident. The sense of duty wears away,\r\ndevoted service is never given without a mental reservation touching\r\nthe morrow--that unknown morrow, which checkmates the boldest plans.\r\nThus constituted, such regimes are all alike, and it was not for the\r\nprinces of the House of France to draw their swords to impose one form\r\nof national humiliation rather than another on their country.\r\n\r\nWhen once my father's rule had disappeared, and with it the unvarying\r\nline of duty traced by my absolute filial devotion to him, I watched\r\nthe establishment of a republican form of government without annoyance,\r\nfor I preferred its clear distinctness to the complicated combinations\r\nwhich pretended to reconcile two opposite principles by putting\r\nhandcuffs on them both.\r\n\r\nLike many others, too, I did not doubt that the shock of revolution\r\nwould soon bring on a general war. Under such circumstances, it would\r\nhave been crime to add the pangs of civil strife to the dangers\r\nthreatening our country.\r\n\r\nThenceforward, my duty lay clear before me. My country first of all!\r\nThat watchword still exists, thank God, to guide those who yet can love\r\ntheir country whatever may befall them. When once my first fit of\r\nindignation was over, then, I did not think of returning from Africa,\r\nsword in hand, to set up the throne again. I contented myself with\r\nsending a very commonplace despatch to Arago, and then I utilised the\r\nlast days I was to spend on French soil in studying the defensive works\r\nordered by my brother in view of that war, imminent perhaps, during\r\nwhich, soldiers before all as we were, we expected, in the illusive\r\nhopes of our youth, to be allowed to keep our place as fighting men.\r\n\r\nThe moment came at last when our presence at Algiers became\r\nincompatible with the existence of a revolutionary government in Paris,\r\nand we had to rejoin our family in their foreign exile. We decided,\r\nAumale and I, to embark for England on board the despatch-boat Solon,\r\nCommander Jaures. It was with heavy hearts, though proud ones, that we\r\nwent down the Rue de la Marine, under the salutes of the forts, and\r\naccompanied to the last by the whole body of officers, both naval and\r\nmilitary, so many of them our old friends and faithful comrades.\r\n\r\nThirty years of my life had been spent in France. In spite of the\r\ngnawing worm of revolution, my family left her intact, prosperous,\r\nrespected, with magnificent armies, both land and sea, and a no less\r\nmagnificent colony. I was not to see my country again for\r\ntwo-and-twenty years, and then in all the horror of invasion and\r\ndismemberment and the terror of the Commune.\r\n\r\nTHE END",
