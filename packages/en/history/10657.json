The famous line, _\"Nil actum reputans si quid superesset\r\nagendum,\"_ is a fine feature of the real character, finely expressed.\r\nBut, if it had been Lucan's purpose (as possibly, with a view to\r\nPompey's benefit, in some respects it was) utterly and extravagantly to\r\nfalsify the character of the great Dictator, by no single trait could he\r\nmore effectually have fulfilled that purpose, nor in fewer words, than\r\nby this expressive passage, _\"Gaudensque viam fecisse ruina.\"_ Such a\r\ntrait would be almost extravagant applied even to Marius, who (though in\r\nmany respects a perfect model of Roman grandeur, massy, columnar,\r\nimperturbable, and more perhaps than any one man recorded in History\r\ncapable of justifying the bold illustration of that character in Horace,\r\n\"_Si fractus illabatur orbis, impavidum ferient ruinae_\") had, however,\r\na ferocity in his character, and a touch of the devil in him, very\r\nrarely united with the same tranquil intrepidity. But, for Caesar, the\r\nall-accomplished statesman, the splendid orator, the man of elegant\r\nhabits and polished taste, the patron of the fine arts in a degree\r\ntranscending all example of his own or the previous age, and as a man of\r\ngeneral literature so much beyond his contemporaries, except Cicero,\r\nthat he looked down even upon the brilliant Sylla as an illiterate\r\nperson--to class such a man with the race of furious destroyers exulting\r\nin the desolations they spread is to err not by an individual trait, but\r\nby the whole genus. The Attilas and the Tamerlanes, who rejoice in\r\navowing themselves the scourges of God, and the special instruments of\r\nhis wrath, have no one feature of affinity to the polished and humane\r\nCaesar, and would as little have comprehended his character as he could\r\nhave respected theirs. Even Cato, the unworthy hero of Lucan, might have\r\nsuggested to him a little more truth in this instance, by a celebrated\r\nremark which he made on the characteristic distinction of Caesar, in\r\ncomparison with other revolutionary disturbers; for, said he, whereas\r\nothers had attempted the overthrow of the state in a continued paroxysm\r\nof fury, and in a state of mind resembling the lunacy of intoxication,\r\nCaesar, on the contrary, among that whole class of civil disturbers, was\r\nthe only one who had come to the task in a temper of sobriety and\r\nmoderation _(unum accessisse sobrium ad rempublicam delendam)_....\r\n\r\nGreat as Caesar was by the benefit of his original nature, there can be\r\nno doubt that he, like others, owed something to circumstances; and\r\nperhaps amongst those which were most favourable to the premature\r\ndevelopment of great self-dependence we must reckon the early death of\r\nhis father. It is, or it is not, according to the nature of men, an\r\nadvantage to be orphaned at as early age. Perhaps utter orphanage is\r\nrarely or never such: but to lose a father betimes may, under\r\nappropriate circumstances, profit a strong mind greatly. To Caesar it\r\nwas a prodigious benefit that he lost his father when not much more than\r\nfifteen. Perhaps it was an advantage also to his father that he died\r\nthus early. Had he stayed a year longer, he might have seen himself\r\ndespised, baffled, and made ridiculous. For where, let us ask, in any\r\nage, was the father capable of adequately sustaining that relation to\r\nthe unique Caius Julius--to him, in the appropriate language of\r\nShakespeare\r\n\r\n  \"The foremost man of all this world?\"\r\n\r\nAnd, in this fine and Caesarean line, \"this world\" is to be understood\r\nnot of the order of co-existences merely,` but also of the order of\r\nsuccessions; he was the foremost man not only of his contemporaries, but\r\nalso, within his own intellectual class, of men generally--of all that\r\never should come after him, or should sit on thrones under the\r\ndenominations of Czars, Kesars, or Caesars of the Bosphorus and the\r\nDanube; of all in every age that should inherit his supremacy of mind,\r\nor should subject to themselves the generations of ordinary men by\r\nqualities analogous to his. Of this infinite superiority some part must\r\nbe ascribed to his early emancipation from paternal control. There are\r\nvery many cases in which, simply from considerations of sex, a female\r\ncannot stand forward as the head of a family, or as its suitable\r\nrepresentative. If they are even ladies paramount, and in situations of\r\ncommand, they are also women. The staff of authority does not annihilate\r\ntheir sex; and scruples of female delicacy interfere for ever to unnerve\r\nand emasculate in their hands the sceptre however otherwise potent.\r\nHence we see, in noble families, the merest boys put forward to\r\nrepresent the family dignity, as fitter supporters of that burden than\r\ntheir mature mothers. And of Caesar's mother, though little is recorded,\r\nand that little incidentally, this much at least we learn--that, if she\r\nlooked down upon him with maternal pride and delight, she looked up to\r\nhim with female ambition as the re-edifier of her husband's honours,--\r\nlooked with reverence as to a column of the Roman grandeur and with fear\r\nand feminine anxieties as to one whose aspiring spirit carried him but\r\ntoo prematurely into the fields of adventurous strife. One slight and\r\nevanescent sketch of the relations which subsisted between Caesar and\r\nhis mother, caught from the wrecks of time, is preserved both by\r\nPlutarch and Suetonius. We see in the early dawn the young patrician\r\nstanding upon the steps of his patrimonial portico, his mother with her\r\narms wreathed about his neck, looking up to his noble countenance,\r\nsometimes drawing auguries of hope from features so fitted for command,\r\nsometimes boding an early blight to promises so dangerously magnificent.\r\nThat she had something of her son's aspiring character, or that he\r\npresumed so much in a mother of his, we learn from the few words which\r\nsurvive of their conversation. He addressed to her no language that\r\ncould tranquillise her fears. On the contrary, to any but a Roman mother\r\nhis valedictory words, taken in connexion with the known determination\r\nof his character, were of a nature to consummate her depression, as they\r\ntended to confirm the very worst of her fears. He was then going to\r\nstand his chance in a popular electioneering contest for an office of\r\nthe highest dignity, and to launch himself upon the storms of the Campus\r\nMartius. At that period, besides other and more ordinary dangers, the\r\nbands of gladiators, kept in the pay of the more ambitious or turbulent\r\namongst the Roman nobles, gave a popular tone of ferocity and of\r\npersonal risk to the course of such contests; and, either to forestall\r\nthe victory of an antagonist, or to avenge their own defeat, it was not\r\nat all impossible that a body of incensed competitors might intercept\r\nhis final triumph by assassination. For this danger, however, he had no\r\nleisure in his thoughts of consolation; the sole danger which _he_\r\ncontemplated, or supposed his mother to contemplate, was the danger of\r\ndefeat, and for that he reserved his consolations. He bade her fear\r\nnothing; for that his determination was to return with victory, and with\r\nthe ensigns of the dignity he sought, or to return a corpse.\r\n\r\nEarly indeed did Caesar's trials commence; and it is probable, that, had\r\nnot the death of his father, by throwing him prematurely upon his own\r\nresources, prematurely developed the masculine features of his\r\ncharacter, forcing him whilst yet a boy under the discipline of civil\r\nconflict and the yoke of practical life, even _his_ energies might have\r\nbeen insufficient to sustain them. His age is not exactly ascertained;\r\nbut it is past a doubt that he had not reached his twentieth year when\r\nhe had the hardihood to engage in a struggle with Sylla, then Dictator,\r\nand exercising the immoderate powers of that office with the licence and\r\nthe severity which History has made so memorable. He had neither any\r\ndistinct grounds of hope, nor any eminent example at that time, to\r\ncountenance him in this struggle--which yet he pushed on in the most\r\nuncompromising style, and to the utmost verge of defiance. The subject\r\nof the contest gives it a further interest. It was the youthful wife of\r\nthe youthful Caesar who stood under the shadow of the great Dictator's\r\ndispleasure; not personally, but politically, on account of her\r\nconnexions: and her it was, Cornelia, the daughter of a man who had been\r\nfour times consul, that Caesar was required to divorce: but he spurned\r\nthe haughty mandate, and carried his determination to a triumphant\r\nissue, notwithstanding his life was at stake, and at one time saved only\r\nby shifting his place of concealment every night; and this young lady it\r\nwas who afterwards became the mother of his only daughter. Both mother\r\nand daughter, it is remarkable, perished prematurely, and at critical\r\nperiods of Caesar's life; for it is probable enough that these\r\nirreparable wounds to Caesar's domestic affections threw him with more\r\nexclusiveness of devotion upon the fascinations of glory and ambition\r\nthan might have happened under a happier condition of his private life.\r\nThat Caesar should have escaped destruction in this unequal contest with\r\nan enemy then wielding the whole thunders of the state, is somewhat\r\nsurprising; and historians have sought their solution of the mystery in\r\nthe powerful intercessions of the vestal virgins, and several others of\r\nhigh rank amongst the connexions of his great house. These may have done\r\nsomething; but it is due to Sylla, who had a sympathy with everything\r\ntruly noble, to suppose him struck with powerful admiration for the\r\naudacity of the young patrician, standing out in such severe solitude\r\namong so many examples of timid concession; and that to this magnanimous\r\nfeeling in the Dictator much of the indulgence which he showed may have\r\nbeen really due. In fact, according to some accounts, it was not Sylla,\r\nbut the creatures of Sylla (_adjutores_), who pursued Caesar. We know,\r\nat all events, that Sylla formed a right estimate of Caesar's character,\r\nand that, from the complexion of his conduct in this one instance, he\r\ndrew that famous prophecy of his future destiny; bidding his friends\r\nbeware of that slipshod boy, \"for that in him lay couchant many a\r\nMarius.\" A grander testimony to the awe which Caesar inspired, or from\r\none who knew better the qualities of that Cyclopean man by whose scale\r\nhe measured the patrician boy, cannot be imagined.\r\n\r\nIt is not our intention, or consistent with our plan, to pursue this\r\ngreat man through the whole circumstances of his romantic career; though\r\nit is certain that many parts of his life require investigation much\r\nkeener than has ever been applied to them, and that many might be placed\r\nin a new light. Indeed, the whole of this most momentous section of\r\nancient history ought to be recomposed with the critical scepticism of a\r\nNiebuhr, and the same comprehensive collation, resting, if possible, on\r\nthe felicitous interpretation of authorities. In reality it is the hinge\r\nupon which turned the future destiny of the whole earth, and, having\r\ntherefore a common relation to all modern nations whatsoever, should\r\nnaturally have been cultivated with the zeal which belongs to a personal\r\nconcern. In general, the anecdotes which express most vividly the\r\ngrandeur of character in the first Caesar are those which illustrate his\r\ndefiance of danger in extremity: the prodigious energy and rapidity of\r\nhis decisions and motions in the field (looking to which it was that\r\nCicero called him [Greek: teras] or portentous revelation); the skill\r\nwith which he penetrated the designs of his enemies, and the electric\r\nspeed with which he met disasters with remedy and reparation, or, where\r\nthat was impossible, with relief; the extraordinary presence of mind\r\nwhich he showed in turning adverse omens to his own advantage, as when,\r\nupon stumbling in coming on shore (which was esteemed a capital omen of\r\nevil), he transfigured as it were in one instant its whole meaning by\r\nexclaiming, \"Thus, and by this contact with the earth, do I take\r\npossession of thee, O Africa!\" in that way giving to an accident the\r\nsemblance of a symbolic purpose. Equally conspicuous was the grandeur of\r\nfortitude with which he faced the whole extent of a calamity when\r\npalliation could do no good, \"non negando, minuendove, sed insuper\r\namplificando, _ementiendoque_\"; as when, upon finding his soldiery\r\nalarmed at the approach of Juba, with forces really great, but\r\nexaggerated by their terrors, he addressed them in a military harangue\r\nto the following effect:--\"Know that within a few days the king will\r\ncome up with us, bringing with him sixty thousand legionaries, thirty\r\nthousand cavalry, one hundred thousand light troops, besides three\r\nhundred elephants. Such being the case, let me hear no more of\r\nconjectures and opinions, for you have now my warrant for the fact,\r\nwhose information is past doubting. Therefore, be satisfied; otherwise,\r\nI will put every man of you on board some crazy old fleet, and whistle\r\nyou down the tide--no matter under what winds, no matter towards what\r\nshore.\" Finally, we might seek for _characteristic_ anecdotes of Caesar\r\nin his unexampled liberalities and contempt of money.\r\n\r\nUpon this last topic it is the just remark of Casaubon that some\r\ninstances of Caesar's munificence have been thought apocryphal, or to\r\nrest upon false readings, simply from ignorance of the heroic scale upon\r\nwhich the Roman splendours of that age proceeded. A forum which Caesar\r\nbuilt out of the products of his last campaign, by way of a present to\r\nthe Roman people, cost him--for the ground merely on which it stood--\r\nnearly eight hundred thousand pounds. To the citizens of Rome he\r\npresented, in one _congiary_, about two guineas and a half a head. To\r\nhis army, in one _donation_, upon the termination of the Civil War, he\r\ngave a sum which allowed about two hundred pounds a man to the infantry,\r\nand four hundred to the cavalry. It is true that the legionary troops\r\nwere then much reduced by the sword of the enemy, and by the tremendous\r\nhardships of their last campaigns. In this, however, he did perhaps no\r\nmore than repay a debt. For it is an instance of military attachment,\r\nbeyond all that Wallenstein or any commander, the most beloved amongst\r\nhis troops, has ever experienced, that, on the breaking out of the Civil\r\nWar, not only did the centurions of every legion severally maintain a\r\nhorse soldier, but even the privates volunteered to serve without pay,\r\nand (what might seem impossible) without their daily rations. This was\r\naccomplished by subscriptions amongst themselves, the more opulent\r\nundertaking for the maintenance of the needy. Their disinterested love\r\nfor Caesar appeared in another and more difficult illustration: it was a\r\ntraditionary anecdote in Rome that the majority of those amongst\r\nCaesar's troops who had the misfortune to fall into the enemy's hands\r\nrefused to accept their lives under the condition of serving against\r\n_him_.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with this subject of his extraordinary munificence, there\r\nis one aspect of Caesar's life which has suffered much from the\r\nmisrepresentations of historians, and that is--the vast pecuniary\r\nembarrassments under which he laboured, until the profits of war had\r\nturned the scale even more prodigiously in his favour. At one time of\r\nhis life, when appointed to a foreign office, so numerous and so\r\nclamorous were his creditors that he could not have left Rome on his\r\npublic duties had not Crassus come forward with assistance in money, or\r\nby guarantees, to the amount of nearly two hundred thousand pounds. And\r\nat another he was accustomed to amuse himself with computing how much\r\nmoney it would require to make him worth exactly nothing (_i.e._ simply\r\nto clear him of debts); this, by one account, amounted to upwards of two\r\nmillions sterling. Now, the error of historians has been to represent\r\nthese debts as the original ground of his ambition and his revolutionary\r\nprojects, as though the desperate condition of his private affairs had\r\nsuggested a civil war to his calculations as the best or only mode of\r\nredressing it. Such a policy would have resembled the last desperate\r\nresource of an unprincipled gambler, who, on seeing his final game at\r\nchess, and the accumulated stakes depending upon it, all on the brink of\r\nirretrievable sacrifice, dexterously upsets the chess-board, or\r\nextinguishes the lights. But Julius, the one sole patriot of Rome, could\r\nfind no advantage to his plans in darkness or in confusion. Honestly\r\nsupported, he would have crushed the oligarchies of Rome by crushing in\r\nits lairs that venal and hunger-bitten democracy which made oligarchy\r\nand its machineries resistless. Caesar's debts, far from being\r\nstimulants and exciting causes of his political ambition, stood in an\r\ninverse relation to the ambition; they were its results, and represented\r\nits natural costs, being contracted from first to last in the service of\r\nhis political intrigues, for raising and maintaining a powerful body of\r\npartisans, both in Rome and elsewhere. Whosoever indeed will take the\r\ntrouble to investigate the progress of Caesar's ambition, from such\r\nmaterials as even yet remain, may satisfy himself that the scheme of\r\nrevolutionizing the Republic, and placing himself at its head, was no\r\ngrowth of accident or circumstances; above all, that it did not arise\r\nupon any so petty and indirect a suggestion as that of his debts; but\r\nthat his debts were in their very first origin purely ministerial to his\r\nwise, indispensable, and patriotic ambition; and that his revolutionary\r\nplans were at all periods of his life a direct and foremost object, but\r\nin no case bottomed upon casual impulses. In this there was not only\r\npatriotism, but in fact the one sole mode of patriotism which could have\r\nprospered, or could have found a field of action.\r\n\r\nChatter not, sublime reader, commonplaces of scoundrel moralists against\r\nambition. In some cases ambition is a hopeful virtue; in others (as in\r\nthe Rome of our resplendent Julius) ambition was the virtue by which any\r\nother could flourish. It had become evident to everybody that Rome,\r\nunder its present constitution, must fall; and the sole question was--by\r\nwhom? Even Pompey, not by nature of an aspiring turn, and prompted to\r\nhis ambitious course undoubtedly by circumstances and, the friends who\r\nbesieged him, was in the habit of saying, \"Sylla potuit: ego non\r\npotero?\" _Sylla found it possible: shall I find it not so?_ Possible to\r\ndo what? To overthrow the political system of the Republic. This had\r\nsilently collapsed into an order of things so vicious, growing also so\r\nhopelessly worse, that all honest patriots invoked a purifying\r\nrevolution, even though bought at the heavy price of a tyranny, rather\r\nthan face the chaos of murderous distractions to which the tide of feuds\r\nand frenzies was violently tending.\r\n\r\nSuch a revolution at such a price was not less Pompey's object than\r\nCaesar's. In a case, therefore, where no benefit of choice was allowed\r\nto Rome as respected the thing, but only as respected the person, Caesar\r\nhad the same right to enter the arena in the character of combatant as\r\ncould belong to any one of his rivals. And that he _did_ enter that\r\narena constructively, and by secret design, from his very earliest\r\nmanhood, may be gathered from this--that he suffered no openings towards\r\na revolution, provided they had any hope in them, to escape his\r\nparticipation. It is familiarly known that he was engaged pretty deeply\r\nin the conspiracy of Catiline, and that he incurred considerable risk on\r\nthat occasion; but it is less known that he was a party to at least two\r\nother conspiracies. There was even a fourth, meditated by Crassus, which\r\nCaesar so far encouraged as to undertake a journey to Rome from a very\r\ndistant quarter merely with a view to such chances as it might offer to\r\nhim; but, as it did not, upon examination, seem to him a very promising\r\nscheme, he judged it best to look coldly upon it, or not to embark in it\r\nby any personal co-operation. Upon these and other facts we build our\r\ninference--that the scheme of a revolution was the one great purpose of\r\nCaesar from his first entrance upon public life. Nor does it appear that\r\nhe cared much by whom it was undertaken, provided only there seemed to\r\nbe any sufficient resources for carrying it through, and for sustaining\r\nthe first collision with the regular forces of the existing oligarchies,\r\ntaking or _not_ taking the shape of triumvirates. He relied, it seems,\r\non his own personal superiority for raising him to the head of affairs\r\neventually, let who would take the nominal lead at first.\r\n\r\nTo the same result, it will be found, tended the vast stream of Caesar's\r\nliberalities. From the senator downwards to the lowest _faex Romuli_, he\r\nhad a hired body of dependents, both in and out of Rome, equal in\r\nnumbers to a nation. In the provinces, and in distant kingdoms, he\r\npursued the same schemes. Everywhere he had a body of mercenary\r\npartisans; kings even are known to have taken his pay. And it is\r\nremarkable that even in his character of commander-in-chief, where the\r\nnumber of legions allowed to him for the accomplishment of his Gaulish\r\nmission raised him for a number of years above all fear of coercion or\r\ncontrol, he persevered steadily in the same plan of providing for the\r\ndistant day when he might need assistance, not _from_ the state, but\r\n_against_ the state. For, amongst the private anecdotes which came to\r\nlight under the researches made into his history after his death, was\r\nthis--that, soon after his first entrance upon his government in Gaul,\r\nhe had raised, equipped, disciplined, and maintained, from his own\r\nprivate funds, a legion amounting, possibly, to six or seven thousand\r\nmen, who were bound to no sacrament of military obedience to the state,\r\nnor owed fealty to any auspices except those of Caesar. This legion,\r\nfrom the fashion of their crested helmets, which resembled the heads of\r\na small aspiring bird, received the popular name of the _Alauda_ (or\r\nLark) legion. And very singular it was that Cato, or Marcellus, or some\r\namongst those enemies of Caesar who watched his conduct during the\r\nperiod of his Gaulish command with the vigilance of rancorous malice,\r\nshould not have come to the knowledge of this fact; in which case we may\r\nbe sure that it would have been denounced to the Senate.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, for its purpose and its uniform motive, was the sagacious\r\nmunificence of Caesar. Apart from this motive, and considered in and for\r\nitself, and simply with a reference to the splendid forms which it often\r\nassumed, this munificence would furnish the materials for a volume. The\r\npublic entertainments of Caesar, his spectacles and shows, his\r\nnaumachiae, and the pomps of his unrivalled triumphs (the closing\r\ntriumphs of the Republic), were severally the finest of their kind which\r\nhad then been brought forward. Sea-fights were exhibited upon the\r\ngrandest scale, according to every known variety of nautical equipment\r\nand mode of conflict, upon a vast lake formed artificially for that\r\nexpress purpose. Mimic land-fights were conducted, in which all the\r\ncircumstances of real war were so faithfully rehearsed that even\r\nelephants \"indorsed with towers,\" twenty on each side, took part in the\r\ncombat. Dramas were represented in every known language (_per omnium\r\nlinguarum histriones_). And hence (that is, from the conciliatory\r\nfeeling thus expressed towards the various tribes of foreigners resident\r\nin Rome) some have derived an explanation of what is else a mysterious\r\ncircumstance amongst the ceremonial observances at Caesar's funeral--\r\nthat all people of foreign nations then residing at Rome distinguished\r\nthemselves by the conspicuous share which they took in the public\r\nmourning; and that, beyond all other foreigners, the Jews for night\r\nafter night kept watch and ward about the Emperor's grave. Never before,\r\naccording to traditions which lasted through several generations in\r\nRome, had there been so vast a conflux of the human race congregated to\r\nany one centre, on any one attraction of business or of pleasure, as to\r\nRome on occasion of these triumphal spectacles exhibited by Caesar.\r\n\r\nIn our days, the greatest occasional gatherings of the human race are in\r\nIndia, especially at the great fair of the _Hurdwar_ on the Ganges in\r\nnorthern Hindustan: a confluence of some millions is sometimes seen at\r\nthat spot, brought together under the mixed influences of devotion and\r\ncommercial business, but very soon dispersed as rapidly as they had been\r\nconvoked. Some such spectacle of nations crowding upon nations, and some\r\nsuch Babylonian confusion of dresses, complexions, languages, and\r\njargons, was then witnessed at Rome. Accommodations within doors, and\r\nunder roofs of houses, or roofs of temples, was altogether impossible.\r\nMyriads encamped along the streets, and along the high-roads, fields, or\r\ngardens. Myriads lay stretched on the ground, without even the slight\r\nprotection of tents, in a vast circuit about the city. Multitudes of\r\nmen, even senators, and others of the highest rank, were trampled to\r\ndeath in the crowds. And the whole family of man might seem at that time\r\nto be converged at the bidding of the dead Dictator. But these, or any\r\nother themes connected with the public life of Caesar, we notice only in\r\nthose circumstances which have been overlooked, or partially\r\nrepresented, by historians. Let us now, in conclusion, bring forward,\r\nfrom the obscurity in which they have hitherto lurked, the anecdotes\r\nwhich describe the habits of his private life, his tastes, and personal\r\npeculiarities.\r\n\r\nIn person, he was tall, fair, gracile, and of limbs distinguished for\r\ntheir elegant proportions. His eyes were black and piercing. These\r\ncircumstances continued to be long remembered, and no doubt were\r\nconstantly recalled to the eyes of all persons in the imperial palaces\r\nby pictures, busts, and statues; for we find the same description of his\r\npersonal appearance three centuries afterwards in a work of the Emperor\r\nJulian's. He was a most accomplished horseman, and a master\r\n(_peritissimus_) in the use of arms. But, notwithstanding his skill and\r\nhorsemanship, it seems that, when he accompanied his army on marches, he\r\nwalked oftener than he rode; no doubt, with a view to the benefit of his\r\nexample, and to express that sympathy with his soldiers which gained him\r\ntheir hearts so entirely. On other occasions, when travelling apart from\r\nhis army, he seems more frequently to have ridden in a carriage than on\r\nhorseback. His purpose, in this preference, must have been with a view\r\nto the transport of luggage. The carriage which he generally used was a\r\n_rheda_, a sort of gig, or rather curricle; for it was a _four_-wheeled\r\ncarriage, and adapted (as we find from the imperial regulations for the\r\npublic carriages, etc.) to the conveyance of about half a ton. The mere\r\npersonal baggage which Caesar carried with him was probably\r\nconsiderable; for he was a man of elegant habits, and in all parts of\r\nhis life sedulously attentive to elegance of personal appearance. The\r\nlength of journeys which he accomplished within a given time appears\r\neven to us at this day, and might well therefore appear to his\r\ncontemporaries, truly astonishing. A distance of one hundred miles was\r\nno extraordinary day's journey for him in a _rheda_, such as we have\r\ndescribed it. So refined were his habits, and so constant his demand for\r\nthe luxurious accommodations of polished life as it then existed in\r\nRome, that he is said to have carried with him, as indispensable parts\r\nof his personal baggage, the little ivory lozenges, squares and circles\r\nor ovals, with other costly materials, wanted for the tessellated\r\nflooring of his tent. Habits such as these will easily account for his\r\ntravelling in a carriage rather than on horseback.\r\n\r\nThe courtesy and obliging disposition of Caesar were notorious; and both\r\nwere illustrated in some anecdotes which survived for generations in\r\nRome. Dining on one occasion, as an invited guest, at a table where the\r\nservants had inadvertently, for salad-oil, furnished some sort of coarse\r\nlamp-oil, Caesar would not allow the rest of the company to point out\r\nthe mistake to their host, for fear of shocking him too much by exposing\r\nwhat might have been construed into inhospitality. At another time,\r\nwhilst halting at a little _cabaret_, when one of his retinue was\r\nsuddenly taken ill, Caesar resigned to his use the sole bed which the\r\nhouse afforded. Incidents as trifling as these express the urbanity of\r\nCaesar's nature; and hence one is the more surprised to find the\r\nalienation of the Senate charged, in no trifling degree, upon a gross\r\nand most culpable failure in point of courtesy. Caesar, it is alleged--\r\nbut might we presume to call upon antiquity for its authority?--\r\nneglected to rise from his seat, on their approaching him with an\r\naddress of congratulation. It is said, and we can believe it, that he\r\ngave deeper offence by this one defect in a matter of ceremonial\r\nobservance than by all his substantial attacks upon their privileges.\r\nWhat we find it difficult to believe is not that result from that\r\noffence--this is no more than we should all anticipate--not _that_, but\r\nthe possibility of the offence itself, from one so little arrogant as\r\nCaesar, and so entirely a man of the world. He was told of the disgust\r\nwhich he had given; and we are bound to believe his apology, in which he\r\ncharged it upon sickness, that would not at the moment allow him to\r\nmaintain a standing attitude. Certainly the whole tenor of his life was\r\nnot courteous only, but kind, and to his enemies merciful in a degree\r\nwhich implied so much more magnanimity than men in general could\r\nunderstand that by many it was put down to the account of weakness.\r\n\r\nWeakness, however, there was none in Caius Caesar; and, that there might\r\nbe none, it was fortunate that conspiracy should have cut him off in the\r\nfull vigour of his faculties, in the very meridian of his glory, and on\r\nthe brink of completing a series of gigantic achievements. Amongst these\r\nare numbered:--a digest of the entire body of laws, even then become\r\nunwieldy and oppressive; the establishment of vast and comprehensive\r\npublic libraries, Greek as well as Latin; the chastisement of Dacia\r\n(that needed a cow-hiding for insolence as much as Affghanistan from us\r\nin 1840); the conquest of Parthia; and the cutting a ship canal through\r\nthe Isthmus of Corinth. The reformation of the Calendar he had already\r\naccomplished. And of all his projects it may be said that they were\r\nequally patriotic in their purpose and colossal in their proportions.\r\n\r\nAs an orator, Caesar's merit was so eminent that, according to the\r\ngeneral belief, had he found time to cultivate this department of civil\r\nexertion, the received supremacy of Cicero would have been made\r\nquestionable, or the honour would have been divided. Cicero himself was\r\nof that opinion, and on different occasions applied the epithet\r\n_splendidus_ to Caesar, as though in some exclusive sense, or with some\r\npeculiar emphasis, due to him. His taste was much simpler, chaster, and\r\nless inclined to the _florid_ and Asiatic, than that of Cicero. So far\r\nhe would, in that condition of the Roman culture and feeling, have been\r\nless acceptable to the public; but, on the other hand, he would have\r\ncompensated this disadvantage by much more of natural and Demosthenic\r\nfervour.\r\n\r\nIn literature, the merits of Caesar are familiar to most readers. Under\r\nthe modest title of _Commentaries_, he meant to offer the records of his\r\nGallic and British campaigns, simply as notes, or memoranda, afterwards\r\nto be worked up by regular historians; but, as Cicero observes, their\r\nmerit was such in the eyes of the discerning that all judicious writers\r\nshrank from the attempt to alter them. In another instance of his\r\nliterary labours he showed a very just sense of true dignity. Rightly\r\nconceiving that everything patriotic was dignified, and that to\r\nillustrate or polish his native language was a service of real and\r\nparamount patriotism, he composed a work on the grammar and orthoepy of\r\nthe Latin language. Cicero and himself were the only Romans of\r\ndistinction in that age who applied themselves with true patriotism to\r\nthe task of purifying and ennobling their mother tongue. Both were aware\r\nof a transcendent value in the Grecian literature as it then stood; but\r\nthat splendour did not depress their hopes of raising their own to\r\nsomething of the same level. As respected the natural wealth of the two\r\nlanguages, it was the private opinion of Cicero that the Latin had the\r\nadvantage; and, if Caesar did not accompany him to that length--which,\r\nperhaps, under some limitations he ought to have done--he yet felt that\r\nit was but the more necessary to draw forth any special or exceptional\r\nadvantage which it really had.\r\n\r\nWas Caesar, upon the whole, the greatest of men? We restrict the\r\nquestion, of course, to the classes of men great in _action_: great by\r\nthe extent of their influence over their social contemporaries; great by\r\nthrowing open avenues to extended powers that previously had been\r\nclosed; great by making obstacles once vast to become trivial, or prizes\r\nthat once were trivial to be glorified by expansion. I (said Augustus\r\nCaesar) found Rome built of brick; but I left it built of marble. Well,\r\nmy man, we reply, for a wondrously little chap, you did what in\r\nWestmoreland they call a good _darroch_ (day's work); and, if _navvies_\r\nhad been wanted in those days, you should have had our vote to a\r\ncertainty. But Caius Julius, even under such a limitation of the\r\ncomparison, did a thing as much transcending this as it was greater to\r\nproject Rome across the Alps and the Pyrenees,--expanding the grand\r\nRepublic into crowning provinces of 1. France (_Gallia_), 2. Belgium, 3.\r\nHolland (_Batavia_), 4. England (_Britannia_), 5. Savoy (_Allobroges_),\r\n6. Switzerland (_Helvetia_), 7. Spain (_Hispania_),--than to decorate a\r\nstreet or to found an amphitheatre. Dr. Beattie once observed that, if\r\nthat question as to the greatest man in action upon the rolls of History\r\nwere left to be collected from the suffrages already expressed in books\r\nand scattered throughout the literature of all nations, the scale would\r\nbe found to have turned prodigiously in Caesar's favour as against any\r\nsingle competitor; and there is no doubt whatsoever that even amongst\r\nhis own countrymen, and his own contemporaries, the same verdict would\r\nhave been returned, had it been collected upon the famous principle of\r\nThemistocles, that he should be reputed the first whom the greatest\r\nnumber of rival voices had pronounced to be the second.\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n_Works_: Latin folio, Rome, 1469; Venice, 1471; Florence, 1514; London,\r\n1585.

All these differ from each other\r\nin language, customs and laws. The river Garonne separates the Gauls\r\nfrom the Aquitani; the Marne and the Seine separate them from the\r\nBelgae. Of all these, the Belgae are the bravest, because they are\r\nfarthest from the civilisation and refinement of [our] Province, and\r\nmerchants least frequently resort to them and import those things which\r\ntend to effeminate the mind; and they are the nearest to the Germans,\r\nwho dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war;\r\nfor which reason the Helvetii also surpass the rest of the Gauls in\r\nvalour, as they contend with the Germans in almost daily battles, when\r\nthey either repel them from their own territories, or themselves wage\r\nwar on their frontiers. One part of these, which it has been said that\r\nthe Gauls occupy, takes its beginning at the river Rhone: it is bounded\r\nby the river Garonne, the ocean, and the territories of the Belgae: it\r\nborders, too, on the side of the Sequani and the Helvetii, upon the\r\nriver Rhine, and stretches towards the north. The Belgae rise from the\r\nextreme frontier of Gaul, extend to the lower part of the river Rhine;\r\nand look towards the north and the rising sun. Aquitania extends from\r\nthe river Garonne to the Pyrenaean mountains and to that part of the\r\nocean which is near Spain: it looks between the setting of the sun and\r\nthe north star.\r\n\r\nII.--Among the Helvetii, Orgetorix was by far the most distinguished and\r\nwealthy. He, when Marcus Messala and Marcus Piso were consuls, incited\r\nby lust of sovereignty, formed a conspiracy among the nobility, and\r\npersuaded the people to go forth from their territories with all their\r\npossessions, [saying] that it would be very easy, since they excelled\r\nall in valour, to acquire the supremacy of the whole of Gaul. To this he\r\nthe more easily persuaded them, because the Helvetii are confined on\r\nevery side by the nature of their situation; on one side by the Rhine, a\r\nvery broad and deep river, which separates the Helvetian territory from\r\nthe Germans; on a second side by the Jura, a very high mountain which is\r\n[situated] between the Sequani and the Helvetii; on a third by the Lake\r\nof Geneva, and by the river Rhone, which separates our Province from the\r\nHelvetii. From these circumstances it resulted that they could range\r\nless widely, and could less easily make war upon their neighbours; for\r\nwhich reason men fond of war [as they were] were affected with great\r\nregret. They thought, that considering the extent of their population,\r\nand their renown for warfare and bravery, they had but narrow limits,\r\nalthough they extended in length 240, and in breadth 180 [Roman] miles.\r\n\r\nIII.--Induced by these considerations, and influenced by the authority\r\nof Orgetorix, they determined to provide such things as were necessary\r\nfor their expedition--to buy up as great a number as possible of beasts\r\nof burden and waggons--to make their sowings as large as possible, so\r\nthat on their march plenty of corn might be in store--and to establish\r\npeace and friendship with the neighbouring states. They reckoned that a\r\nterm of two years would be sufficient for them to execute their designs;\r\nthey fix by decree their departure for the third year. Orgetorix is\r\nchosen to complete these arrangements. He took upon himself the office\r\nof ambassador to the states: on this journey he persuades Casticus, the\r\nson of Catamantaledes (one of the Sequani, whose father had possessed\r\nthe sovereignty among the people for many years, and had been styled\r\n\"_friend_\" by the senate of the Roman people), to seize upon the\r\nsovereignty in his own state, which his father had held before him, and\r\nhe likewise persuades Dumnorix, an Aeduan, the brother of Divitiacus,\r\nwho at that time possessed the chief authority in the state, and was\r\nexceedingly beloved by the people, to attempt the same, and gives him\r\nhis daughter in marriage. He proves to them that to accomplish their\r\nattempts was a thing very easy to be done, because he himself would\r\nobtain the government of his own state; that there was no doubt that the\r\nHelvetii were the most powerful of the whole of Gaul; he assures them\r\nthat he will, with his own forces and his own army, acquire the\r\nsovereignty for them. Incited by this speech, they give a pledge and\r\noath to one another, and hope that, when they have seized the\r\nsovereignty, they will, by means of the three most powerful and valiant\r\nnations, be enabled to obtain possession of the whole of Gaul.\r\n\r\nIV.--When this scheme was disclosed to the Helvetii by informers, they,\r\naccording to their custom, compelled Orgetorix to plead his cause in\r\nchains; it was the law that the penalty of being burned by fire should\r\nawait him if condemned. On the day appointed for the pleading of his\r\ncause, Orgetorix drew together from all quarters to the court all his\r\nvassals to the number of ten thousand persons; and led together to the\r\nsame place, and all his dependants and debtor-bondsmen, of whom he had a\r\ngreat number; by means of these he rescued himself from [the necessity\r\nof] pleading his cause. While the state, incensed at this act, was\r\nendeavouring to assert its right by arms, and the magistrates were\r\nmustering a large body of men from the country, Orgetorix died; and\r\nthere is not wanting a suspicion, as the Helvetii think, of his having\r\ncommitted suicide.\r\n\r\nV.--After his death, the Helvetii nevertheless attempt to do that which\r\nthey had resolved on, namely, to go forth from their territories. When\r\nthey thought that they were at length prepared for this undertaking,\r\nthey set fire to all their towns, in number about twelve--to their\r\nvillages about four hundred--and to the private dwellings that remained;\r\nthey burn up all the corn, except what they intend to carry with them;\r\nthat after destroying the hope of a return home, they might be the more\r\nready for undergoing all dangers. They order every one to carry forth\r\nfrom home for himself provisions for three months, ready ground. They\r\npersuade the Rauraci, and the Tulingi, and the Latobrigi, their\r\nneighbours, to adopt the same plan, and after burning down their towns\r\nand villages, to set out with them: and they admit to their party and\r\nunite to themselves as confederates the Boii, who had dwelt on the other\r\nside of the Rhine, and had crossed over into the Norican territory, and\r\nassaulted Noreia.\r\n\r\nVI.--There were in all two routes by which they could go forth from\r\ntheir country--one through the Sequani, narrow and difficult, between\r\nMount Jura and the river Rhone (by which scarcely one waggon at a time\r\ncould be led; there was, moreover, a very high mountain overhanging, so\r\nthat a very few might easily intercept them); the other, through our\r\nProvince, much easier and freer from obstacles, because the Rhone flows\r\nbetween the boundaries of the Helvetii and those of the Allobroges, who\r\nhad lately been subdued, and is in some places crossed by a ford. The\r\nfurthest town of the Allobroges, and the nearest to the territories of\r\nthe Helvetii, is Geneva. From this town a bridge extends to the\r\nHelvetii. They thought that they should either persuade the Allobroges,\r\nbecause they did not seem as yet well-affected towards the Roman people,\r\nor compel them by force to allow them to pass through their territories.\r\nHaving provided everything for the expedition, they appoint a day on\r\nwhich they should all meet on the bank of the Rhone. This day was the\r\nfifth before the kalends of April [_i.e._ the 28th of March], in the\r\nconsulship of Lucius Piso and Aulus Gabinius [B.C. 58].\r\n\r\nVII.--When it was reported to Caesar that they were attempting to make\r\ntheir route through our Province, he hastens to set out from the city,\r\nand, by as great marches as he can, proceeds to Further Gaul, and\r\narrives at Geneva. He orders the whole Province [to furnish] as great a\r\nnumber of soldiers as possible, as there was in all only one legion in\r\nFurther Gaul: he orders the bridge at Geneva to be broken down. When the\r\nHelvetii are apprised of his arrival, they send to him, as ambassadors,\r\nthe most illustrious men of their state (in which embassy Numeius and\r\nVerudoctius held the chief place), to say \"that it was their intention\r\nto march through the Province without doing any harm, because they had\"\r\n[according to their own representations] \"no other route:--that they\r\nrequested they might be allowed to do so with his consent.\" Caesar,\r\ninasmuch as he kept in remembrance that Lucius Cassius, the consul, had\r\nbeen slain, and his army routed and made to pass under the yoke by the\r\nHelvetii, did not think that [their request] ought to be granted; nor\r\nwas he of opinion that men of hostile disposition, if an opportunity of\r\nmarching through the Province were given them, would abstain from\r\noutrage and mischief. Yet, in order that a period might intervene, until\r\nthe soldiers whom he had ordered [to be furnished] should assemble, he\r\nreplied to the ambassadors, that he would take time to deliberate; if\r\nthey wanted anything, they might return on the day before the ides of\r\nApril [on April 12th].\r\n\r\nVIII.--Meanwhile, with the legion which he had with him and the soldiers\r\nwho had assembled from the Province, he carries along for nineteen\r\n[Roman, not quite eighteen English] miles a wall, to the height of\r\nsixteen feet, and a trench, from the lake of Geneva, which flows into\r\nthe river Rhone, to Mount Jura, which separates the territories of the\r\nSequani from those of the Helvetii. When that work was finished, he\r\ndistributes garrisons, and closely fortifies redoubts, in order that he\r\nmay the more easily intercept them, if they should attempt to cross over\r\nagainst his will. When the day which he had appointed with the\r\nambassadors came, and they returned to him, he says that he cannot,\r\nconsistently with the custom and precedent of the Roman people, grant\r\nany one a passage through the Province; and he gives them to understand\r\nthat, if they should attempt to use violence, he would oppose them. The\r\nHelvetii, disappointed in this hope, tried if they could force a passage\r\n(some by means of a bridge of boats and numerous rafts constructed for\r\nthe purpose; others, by the fords of the Rhone, where the depth of the\r\nriver was least, sometimes by day, but more frequently by night), but\r\nbeing kept at bay by the strength of our works, and by the concourse of\r\nthe soldiers, and by the missiles, they desisted from this attempt.\r\n\r\nIX.--There was left one way, [namely] through the Sequani, by which, on\r\naccount of its narrowness, they could not pass without the consent of\r\nthe Sequani. As they could not of themselves prevail on them, they send\r\nambassadors to Dumnorix the Aeduan, that through his intercession they\r\nmight obtain their request from the Sequani. Dumnorix, by his popularity\r\nand liberality, had great influence among the Sequani, and was friendly\r\nto the Helvetii, because out of that state he had married the daughter\r\nof Orgetorix; and, incited by lust of sovereignty, was anxious for a\r\nrevolution, and wished to have as many states as possible attached to\r\nhim by his kindness towards them. He, therefore, undertakes the affair,\r\nand prevails upon the Sequani to allow the Helvetii to march through\r\ntheir territories, and arranges that they should give hostages to each\r\nother--the Sequani not to obstruct the Helvetii in their march--the\r\nHelvetii, to pass without mischief and outrage.\r\n\r\nX.--It-is again told Caesar that the Helvetii intend to march through\r\nthe country of the Sequani and the Aedui into the territories of the\r\nSantones, which are not far distant from those boundaries of the\r\nTolosates, which [viz. Tolosa, Toulouse] is a state in the Province. If\r\nthis took place, he saw that it would be attended with great danger to\r\nthe Province to have warlike men, enemies of the Roman people, bordering\r\nupon an open and very fertile tract of country. For these reasons he\r\nappointed Titus Labienus, his lieutenant, to the command of the\r\nfortification which he had made. He himself proceeds to Italy by forced\r\nmarches, and there levies two legions, and leads out from winter-quarters\r\nthree which were wintering around Aquileia, and with these five\r\nlegions marches rapidly by the nearest route across the Alps into\r\nFurther Gaul. Here the Centrones and the Graioceli and the Caturiges,\r\nhaving taken possession of the higher parts, attempt to obstruct the\r\narmy in their march. After having routed these in several battles, he\r\narrives in the territories of the Vocontii in the Further Province on\r\nthe seventh day from Ocelum, which is the most remote town of the Hither\r\nProvince; thence he leads his army into the country of the Allobroges,\r\nand from the Allobroges to the Segusiani. These people are the first\r\nbeyond the Province on the opposite side of the Rhone.\r\n\r\nXI.--The Helvetii had by this time led their forces over through the\r\nnarrow defile and the territories of the Sequani, and had arrived at the\r\nterritories of the Aedui, and were ravaging their lands. The Aedui, as\r\nthey could not defend themselves and their possessions against them,\r\nsend ambassadors to Caesar to ask assistance, [pleading] that they had\r\nat all times so well deserved of the Roman people, that their fields\r\nought not to have been laid waste--their children carried off into\r\nslavery--their towns stormed, almost within sight of our army. At the\r\nsame time the Ambarri, the friends and kinsmen of the Aedui, apprise\r\nCaesar that it was not easy for them, now that their fields had been\r\ndevastated, to ward off the violence of the enemy from their towns: the\r\nAllobroges likewise, who had villages and possessions on the other side\r\nof the Rhone, betake themselves in flight to Caesar and assure him that\r\nthey had nothing remaining, except the soil of their land. Caesar,\r\ninduced by these circumstances, decides that he ought not to wait until\r\nthe Helvetii, after destroying all the property of his allies, should\r\narrive among the Santones.\r\n\r\nXII.--There is a river [called] the Saone, which flows through the\r\nterritories of the Aedui and Sequani into the Rhone with such incredible\r\nslowness, that it cannot be determined by the eye in which direction it\r\nflows. This the Helvetii were crossing by rafts and boats joined\r\ntogether. When Caesar was informed by spies that the Helvetii had\r\nalready conveyed three parts of their forces across that river, but that\r\nthe fourth part was left behind on this side of the Saone, he set out\r\nfrom the camp with three legions during the third watch, and came up\r\nwith that division which had not yet crossed the river. Attacking them,\r\nencumbered with baggage, and not expecting him, he cut to pieces a great\r\npart of them; the rest betook themselves to flight, and concealed\r\nthemselves in the nearest woods. That canton [which was cut down] was\r\ncalled the Tigurine; for the whole Helvetian state is divided into four\r\ncantons. This single canton having left their country, within the\r\nrecollection of our fathers, had slain Lucius Cassius the consul, and\r\nhad made his army pass under the yoke [B.C. 107]. Thus, whether by\r\nchance, or by the design of the immortal gods, that part of the\r\nHelvetian state which had brought a signal calamity upon the Roman\r\npeople was the first to pay the penalty. In this Caesar avenged not only\r\nthe public, but also his own personal wrongs, because the Tigurini had\r\nslain Lucius Piso the lieutenant [of Cassius], the grandfather of Lucius\r\nCalpurnius Piso, his [Caesar's] father-in-law, in the same battle as\r\nCassius himself.\r\n\r\nXIII.--This battle ended, that he might be able to come up with the\r\nremaining forces of the Helvetii, he procures a bridge to be made across\r\nthe Saone, and thus leads his army over. The Helvetii, confused by his\r\nsudden arrival, when they found that he had effected in one day what\r\nthey themselves had with the utmost difficulty accomplished in twenty,\r\nnamely, the crossing of the river, send ambassadors to him; at the head\r\nof which embassy was Divico, who had been commander of the Helvetii in\r\nthe war against Cassius. He thus treats with Caesar:--that, \"if the\r\nRoman people would make peace with the Helvetii they would go to that\r\npart and there remain, where Caesar might appoint and desire them to be;\r\nbut if he should persist in persecuting them with war, that he ought to\r\nremember both the ancient disgrace of the Roman people and the\r\ncharacteristic valour of the Helvetii. As to his having attacked one\r\ncanton by surprise, [at a time] when those who had crossed the river\r\ncould not bring assistance to their friends, that he ought not on that\r\naccount to ascribe very much to his own valour, or despise them; that\r\nthey had so learned from their sires and ancestors, as to rely more on\r\nvalour than on artifice or stratagem. Wherefore let him not bring it to\r\npass that the place, where they were standing, should acquire a name,\r\nfrom the disaster of the Roman people and the destruction of their army\r\nor transmit the remembrance [of such an event to posterity].\"\r\n\r\nXIV.--To these words Caesar thus replied:--that \"on that very account he\r\nfelt less hesitation, because he kept in remembrance those circumstances\r\nwhich the Helvetian ambassadors had mentioned, and that he felt the more\r\nindignant at them, in proportion as they had happened undeservedly to\r\nthe Roman people: for if they had been conscious of having done any\r\nwrong it would not have been difficult to be on their guard, but for\r\nthat very reason had they been deceived, because neither were they aware\r\nthat any offence had been given by them, on account of which they should\r\nbe afraid, nor did they think that they ought to be afraid without\r\ncause. But even if he were willing to forget their former outrage, could\r\nhe also lay aside the remembrance of the late wrongs, in that they had\r\nagainst his will attempted a route through the Province by force, in\r\nthat they had molested the Aedui, the Ambarri, and the Allobroges? That\r\nas to their so insolently boasting of their victory, and as to their\r\nbeing astonished that they had so long committed their outrages with\r\nimpunity, [both these things] tended to the same point; for the immortal\r\ngods are wont to allow those persons whom they wish to punish for their\r\nguilt sometimes a greater prosperity and longer impunity, in order that\r\nthey may suffer the more severely from a reverse of circumstances.\r\nAlthough these things are so, yet, if hostages were to be given him by\r\nthem in order that he may be assured they will do what they promise, and\r\nprovided they will give satisfaction to the Aedui for the outrages which\r\nthey had committed against them and their allies, and likewise to the\r\nAllobroges, he [Caesar] will make peace with them.\" Divico replied, that\r\n\"the Helvetii had been so trained by their ancestors that they were\r\naccustomed to receive, not to give, hostages; of that fact the Roman\r\npeople were witness.\" Having given this reply, he withdrew.\r\n\r\nXV.--On the following day they move their camp from that place; Caesar\r\ndoes the same, and sends forward all his cavalry, to the number of four\r\nthousand (which he had drawn together from all parts of the Province and\r\nfrom the Aedui and their allies), to observe towards what parts the\r\nenemy are directing their march. These, having too eagerly pursued the\r\nenemy's rear, come to a battle with the cavalry of the Helvetii in a\r\ndisadvantageous place, and a few of our men fall. The Helvetii, elated\r\nwith this battle because they had with five hundred horse repulsed so\r\nlarge a body of horse, began to face us more boldly, sometimes too from\r\ntheir rear to provoke our men by an attack. Caesar [however] restrained\r\nhis men from battle, deeming it sufficient for the present to prevent\r\nthe enemy from rapine, forage, and depredation. They marched for about\r\nfifteen days in such a manner that there was not more than five or six\r\nmiles between the enemy's rear and our van.\r\n\r\nXVI.--Meanwhile, Caesar kept daily importuning the Aedui for the corn\r\nwhich they had promised in the name of their state; for, in consequence\r\nof the coldness (Gaul being, as before said, situated towards the\r\nnorth), not only was the corn in the fields not ripe, but there was not\r\nin store a sufficiently large quantity even of fodder: besides he was\r\nunable to use the corn which he had conveyed in ships up the river\r\nSaone, because the Helvetii, from whom he was unwilling to retire, had\r\ndiverted their march from the Saone. The Aedui kept deferring from day\r\nto day, and saying that it was being \"collected--brought in--on the\r\nroad.\" When he saw that he was put off too long, and that the day was\r\nclose at hand on which he ought to serve out the corn to his soldiers,--\r\nhaving called together their chiefs, of whom he had a great number in\r\nhis camp, among them Divitiacus, and Liscus who was invested with the\r\nchief magistracy (whom the Aedui style the Vergobretus, and who is\r\nelected annually, and has power of life and death over his countrymen),\r\nhe severely reprimands them, because he is not assisted by them on so\r\nurgent an occasion, when the enemy were so close at hand, and when\r\n[corn] could neither be bought nor taken from the fields, particularly\r\nas, in a great measure urged by their prayers, he had undertaken the\r\nwar; much more bitterly, therefore, does he complain of his being\r\nforsaken.\r\n\r\nXVII.--Then at length Liscus, moved by Caesar's speech, discloses what\r\nhe had hitherto kept secret:--that \"there are some whose influence with\r\nthe people is very great, who, though private men, have more power than\r\nthe magistrates themselves: that these by seditious and violent language\r\nare deterring the populace from contributing the corn which they ought\r\nto supply; [by telling them] that, if they cannot any longer retain the\r\nsupremacy of Gaul, it were better to submit to the government of Gauls\r\nthan of Romans, nor ought they to doubt that, if the Romans should\r\noverpower the Helvetii, they would wrest their freedom from the Aedui\r\ntogether with the remainder of Gaul. By these very men [said he] are our\r\nplans, and whatever is done in the camp, disclosed to the enemy; that\r\nthey could not be restrained by _him_: nay more, he was well aware that,\r\nthough compelled by necessity, he had disclosed the matter to Caesar, at\r\nhow great a risk he had done it; and for that reason, he had been silent\r\nas long as he could.\"\r\n\r\nXVIII.--Caesar perceived that, by this speech of Liscus, Dumnorix, the\r\nbrother of Divitiacus, was indicated; but, as he was unwilling that\r\nthese matters should be discussed while so many were present, he\r\nspeedily dismisses the council, but detains Liscus: he inquires from him\r\nwhen alone, about those things which he had said in the meeting. He\r\n[Liscus] speaks more unreservedly and boldly. He [Caesar] makes\r\ninquiries on the same points privately of others, and discovers that it\r\nis all true; that \"Dumnorix is the person, a man of the highest daring,\r\nin great favour with the people on account of his liberality, a man\r\neager for a revolution: that for a great many years he has been in the\r\nhabit of contracting for the customs and all the other taxes of the\r\nAedui at a small cost, because when _he_ bids, no one dares to bid\r\nagainst him. By these means he has both increased his own private\r\nproperty and amassed great means for giving largesses; that he maintains\r\nconstantly at his own expense and keeps about his own person a great\r\nnumber of cavalry, and that not only at home, but even among the\r\nneighbouring states, he has great influence, and for the sake of\r\nstrengthening this influence has given his mother in marriage among the\r\nBituriges to a man the most noble and most influential there; that he\r\nhas himself taken a wife from among the Helvetii, and has given his\r\nsister by the mother's side and his female relations in marriage into\r\nother states; that he favours and wishes well to the Helvetii on account\r\nof this connection; and that he hates Caesar and the Romans, on his own\r\naccount, because by their arrival his power was weakened, and his\r\nbrother, Divitiacus, restored to his former position of influence and\r\ndignity: that, if anything should happen to the Romans, he entertains\r\nthe highest hope of gaining the sovereignty by means of the Helvetii,\r\nbut that under the government of the Roman people he despairs not only\r\nof royalty but even of that influence which he already has.\" Caesar\r\ndiscovered too, on inquiring into the unsuccessful cavalry engagement\r\nwhich had taken place a few days before, that the commencement of that\r\nflight had been made by Dumnorix and his cavalry (for Dumnorix was in\r\ncommand of the cavalry which the Aedui had sent for aid to Caesar); that\r\nby their flight the rest of the cavalry was dismayed.\r\n\r\nXIX.--After learning these circumstances, since to these suspicions the\r\nmost unequivocal facts were added, viz., that he had led the Helvetii\r\nthrough the territories of the Sequani; that he had provided that\r\nhostages should be mutually given; that he had done all these things,\r\nnot only without any orders of his [Caesar's] and of his own state's,\r\nbut even without their [the Aedui] knowing anything of it themselves;\r\nthat he [Dumnorix] was reprimanded by the [chief] magistrate of the\r\nAedui; he [Caesar] considered that there was sufficient reason why he\r\nshould either punish him himself, or order the state to do so. One thing\r\n[however] stood in the way of all this--that he had learned by\r\nexperience his brother Divitiacus's very high regard for the Roman\r\npeople, his great affection towards him, his distinguished faithfulness,\r\njustice, and moderation; for he was afraid lest by the punishment of\r\nthis man, he should hurt the feelings of Divitiacus. Therefore, before\r\nhe attempted anything, he orders Divitiacus to be summoned to him, and\r\nwhen the ordinary interpreters had been withdrawn, converses with him\r\nthrough Caius Valerius Procillus, chief of the province of Gaul, an\r\nintimate friend of his, in whom he reposed the highest confidence in\r\neverything; at the same time he reminds him of what was said about\r\nDumnorix in the council of the Gauls, when he himself was present, and\r\nshows what each had said of him privately in his [Caesar's] own\r\npresence; he begs and exhorts him, that, without offence to his\r\nfeelings, he may either himself pass judgment on him [Dumnorix] after\r\ntrying the case, or else order the [Aeduan] state to do so.\r\n\r\nXX.-Divitiacus, embracing Caesar, begins to implore him, with many\r\ntears, that \"he would not pass any very severe sentence upon his\r\nbrother; saying, that he knows that those [charges] are true, and that\r\nnobody suffered more pain on that account than he himself did; for when\r\nhe himself could effect a very great deal by his influence at home and\r\nin the rest of Gaul, and he [Dumnorix] very little on account of his\r\nyouth, the latter had become powerful through his means, which power and\r\nstrength he used not only to the lessening of his [Divitiacus]\r\npopularity, but almost to his ruin; that he, however, was influenced\r\nboth by fraternal affection and by public opinion. But if anything very\r\nsevere from Caesar should befall him [Dumnorix], no one would think that\r\nit had been done without his consent, since he himself held such a place\r\nin Caesar's friendship; from which circumstance it would arise that the\r\naffections of the whole of Gaul would be estranged from him.\" As he was\r\nwith tears begging these things of Caesar in many words, Caesar takes\r\nhis right hand, and, comforting him, begs him to make an end of\r\nentreating, and assures him that his regard for him is so great that he\r\nforgives both the injuries of the republic and his private wrongs, at\r\nhis desire and prayers. He summons Dumnorix to him; he brings in his\r\nbrother; he points out what he censures in him; he lays before him what\r\nhe of himself perceives, and what the state complains of; he warns him\r\nfor the future to avoid all grounds of suspicion; he says that he\r\npardons the past, for the sake of his brother, Divitiacus. He sets spies\r\nover Dumnorix that he may be able to know what he does, and with whom he\r\ncommunicates.\r\n\r\nXXI.--Being on the same day informed by his scouts that the enemy had\r\nencamped at the foot of a mountain eight miles from his own camp, he\r\nsent persons to ascertain what the nature of the mountain was, and of\r\nwhat kind the ascent on every side. Word was brought back that it was\r\neasy. During the third watch he orders Titus Labienus, his lieutenant\r\nwith praetorian powers, to ascend to the highest ridge of the mountain\r\nwith two legions, and with those as guides who had examined the road; he\r\nexplains what his plan is. He himself during the fourth watch, hastens\r\nto them by the same route by which the enemy had gone, and sends on all\r\nthe cavalry before him. Publius Considius, who was reputed to be very\r\nexperienced in military affairs, and had been in the army of Lucius\r\nSulla, and afterwards in that of Marcus Crassus, is sent forward with\r\nthe scouts.\r\n\r\nXXII.--At day-break, when the summit of the mountain was in the\r\npossession of Titus Labienus, and he himself was not further off than a\r\nmile and half from the enemy's camp, nor, as he afterwards ascertained\r\nfrom the captives, had either his arrival or that of Labienus been\r\ndiscovered; Considius, with his horse at full gallop, comes up to him--\r\nsays that the mountain which he [Caesar] wished should be seized by\r\nLabienus, is in possession of the enemy; that he has discovered this by\r\nthe Gallic arms and ensigns. Caesar leads off his forces to the next\r\nhill: [and] draws them up in battle-order. Labienus, as he had been\r\nordered by Caesar not to come to an engagement unless [Caesar's] own\r\nforces were seen near the enemy's camp, that the attack upon the enemy\r\nmight be made on every side at the same time, was, after having taken\r\npossession of the mountain, waiting for our men, and refraining from\r\nbattle. When, at length, the day was far advanced, Caesar learned\r\nthrough spies that the mountain was in possession of his own men, and\r\nthat the Helvetii had moved their camp, and that Considius, struck with\r\nfear, had reported to him, as seen, that which he had not seen. On that\r\nday he follows the enemy at his usual distance, and pitches his camp\r\nthree miles from theirs.\r\n\r\nXXIII.--The next day (as there remained in all only two days' space [to\r\nthe time] when he must serve out the corn to his army, and as he was not\r\nmore than eighteen miles from Bibracte, by far the largest and best-stored\r\ntown of the Aedui) he thought that he ought to provide for a\r\nsupply of corn; and diverted his march from the Helvetii, and advanced\r\nrapidly to Bibracte. This circumstance is reported to the enemy by some\r\ndeserters from Lucius Aemilius, a captain of the Gallic horse. The\r\nHelvetii, either because they thought that the Romans, struck with\r\nterror, were retreating from them, the more so, as the day before,\r\nthough they had seized on the higher grounds, they had not joined\r\nbattle; or because they flattered themselves that they might be cut off\r\nfrom the provisions, altering their plan and changing their route, began\r\nto pursue and to annoy our men in the rear.\r\n\r\nXXIV.--Caesar, when he observes this, draws off his forces to the next\r\nhill, and sent the cavalry to sustain the attack of the enemy. He\r\nhimself, meanwhile, drew up on the middle of the hill a triple line of\r\nhis four veteran legions in such a manner that he placed above him on\r\nthe very summit the two legions which he had lately levied in Hither\r\nGaul, and all the auxiliaries; and he ordered that the whole mountain\r\nshould be covered with men, and that meanwhile the baggage should be\r\nbrought together into one place, and the position be protected by those\r\nwho were posted in the upper line. The Helvetii, having followed with\r\nall their waggons, collected their baggage into one place: they\r\nthemselves, after having repulsed our cavalry and formed a phalanx,\r\nadvanced up to our front line in very close order.\r\n\r\nXXV.--Caesar, having removed out of sight first his own horse, then\r\nthose of all, that he might make the danger of all equal, and do away\r\nwith the hope of flight, after encouraging his men, joined battle. His\r\nsoldiers, hurling their javelins from the higher ground, easily broke\r\nthe enemy's phalanx. That being dispersed, they made a charge on them\r\nwith drawn swords. It was a great hindrance to the Gauls in fighting,\r\nthat, when several of their bucklers had been by one stroke of the\r\n(Roman) javelins pierced through and pinned fast together, as the point\r\nof the iron had bent itself, they could neither pluck it out, nor, with\r\ntheir left hand entangled, fight with sufficient ease; so that many,\r\nafter having long tossed their arm about, chose rather to cast away the\r\nbuckler from their hand, and to fight with their person unprotected. At\r\nlength, worn out with wounds, they began to give way, and as there was\r\nin the neighbourhood a mountain about a mile off, to betake themselves\r\nthither. When the mountain had been gained, and our men were advancing\r\nup, the Boii and Tulingi, who with about 15,000 men closed the enemy's\r\nline of march and served as a guard to their rear, having assailed our\r\nmen on the exposed flank as they advanced [prepared] to surround them;\r\nupon seeing which, the Helvetii, who had betaken themselves to the\r\nmountain, began to press on again and renew the battle. The Romans\r\nhaving faced about, advanced to the attack in two divisions; the first\r\nand second line to withstand those who had been defeated and driven off\r\nthe field; the third to receive those who were just arriving.\r\n\r\nXXVI.--Thus was the contest long and vigorously carried on with doubtful\r\nsuccess. When they could no longer withstand the attacks of our men, the\r\none division, as they had begun to do, betook themselves to the\r\nmountain; the other repaired to their baggage and waggons. For during\r\nthe whole of this battle, although the fight lasted from the seventh\r\nhour [_i.e._ 12 (noon)--1 P.M.] to eventide, no one could see an enemy\r\nwith his back turned. The fight was carried on also at the baggage till\r\nlate in the night, for they had set waggons in the way as a rampart, and\r\nfrom the higher ground kept throwing weapons upon our men, as they came\r\non, and some from between the waggons and the wheels kept darting their\r\nlances and javelins from beneath, and wounding our men. After the fight\r\nhad lasted some time, our men gained possession of their baggage and\r\ncamp. There the daughter and one of the sons of Orgetorix were taken.\r\nAfter that battle about 130,000 men [of the enemy] remained alive, who\r\nmarched incessantly during the whole of that night; and after a march\r\ndiscontinued for no part of the night, arrived in the territories of the\r\nLingones on the fourth day, whilst our men, having stopped for three\r\ndays, both on account of the wounds of the soldiers and the burial of\r\nthe slain, had not been able to follow them. Caesar sent letters and\r\nmessengers to the Lingones [with orders] that they should not assist\r\nthem with corn or with anything else; for that if they should assist\r\nthem, he would regard them in the same light as the Helvetii. After the\r\nthree days' interval he began to follow them himself with all his\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nXXVII.--The Helvetii, compelled by the want of everything, sent\r\nambassadors to him about a surrender. When these had met him in the way\r\nand had thrown themselves at his feet, and speaking in suppliant tone\r\nhad with tears sued for peace, and [when] he had ordered them to await\r\nhis arrival, in the place where they then were, they obeyed his\r\ncommands. When Caesar arrived at that place, he demanded hostages, their\r\narms, and the slaves who had deserted to them. Whilst those things are\r\nbeing sought for and got together, after a night's interval, about 6000\r\nmen of that canton which is called the Verbigene, whether terrified by\r\nfear, lest, after delivering up their arms, they should suffer\r\npunishment, or else induced by the hope of safety, because they supposed\r\nthat, amid so vast a multitude of those who had surrendered themselves,\r\n_their_ flight might either be concealed or entirely overlooked, having\r\nat night-fall departed out of the camp of the Helvetii, hastened to the\r\nRhine and the territories of the Germans.\r\n\r\nXXVIII.--But when Caesar discovered this, he commanded those through\r\nwhose territories they had gone, to seek them, out and to bring them\r\nback again, if they meant to be acquitted before him; and considered\r\nthem, when brought back, in the light of enemies; he admitted all the\r\nrest to a surrender, upon their delivering up the hostages, arms, and\r\ndeserters. He ordered the Helvetii, the Tulingi, and the Latobrigi to\r\nreturn to their territories from which they had come, and as there was\r\nat home nothing whereby they might support their hunger, all the\r\nproductions of the earth having been destroyed, he commanded the\r\nAllobroges to let them have a plentiful supply of corn; and ordered them\r\nto rebuild the towns and villages which they had burnt. This he did,\r\nchiefly on this account, because he was unwilling that the country, from\r\nwhich the Helvetii had departed, should be untenanted, lest the Germans,\r\nwho dwell on the other side of the Rhine, should, on account of the\r\nexcellence of the lands, cross over from their own territories into\r\nthose of the Helvetii, and become borderers upon the province of Gaul\r\nand the Allobroges. He granted the petition of the Aedui, that they\r\nmight settle the Boii, in their own (_i.e._ in the Aeduan) territories,\r\nas these were known to be of distinguished valour to whom they gave\r\nlands, and whom they afterwards admitted to the same state of rights and\r\nfreedom as themselves.\r\n\r\nXXIX.--In the camp of the Helvetii, lists were found, drawn up in Greek\r\ncharacters, and were brought to Caesar, in which an estimate had been\r\ndrawn up, name by name, of the number which had gone forth from their\r\ncountry of those who were able to bear arms; and likewise the boys, the\r\nold men, and the women, separately. Of all which items the total was:-\r\n\r\nOf the _Helvetii_ [lit. of the heads of the Helvetii] 263,000\r\nOf the _Tulingi_                                       36,000\r\nOf the _Latobrigi_                                     14,000\r\nOf the _Rauraci_                                       23,000\r\nOf the _Boii_                                          32,000\r\n                                                      -------\r\nThe sum of all amounted to                            368,000\r\n\r\nOut of these, such as could bear arms [amounted] to about 92,000. When\r\nthe _census_ of those who returned home was taken, as Caesar had\r\ncommanded, the number was found to be 110,000.\r\n\r\nXXX.--When the war with the Helvetii was concluded, ambassadors from\r\nalmost all parts of Gaul, the chiefs of states, assembled to\r\ncongratulate Caesar, [saying] that they were well aware, that, although\r\nhe had taken vengeance on the Helvetii in war, for the old wrongs done\r\nby them to the Roman people, yet that circumstance had happened no less\r\nto the benefit of the land of Gaul than of the Roman people, because the\r\nHelvetii, while their affairs were most flourishing, had quitted their\r\ncountry with the design of making war upon the whole of Gaul, and\r\nseizing the government of it, and selecting, out of a great abundance,\r\nthat spot for an abode which they should judge to be the most convenient\r\nand most productive of all Gaul, and hold the rest of the states as\r\ntributaries. They requested that they might be allowed to proclaim an\r\nassembly of the whole of Gaul for a particular day, and to do that with\r\nCaesar's permission, [stating] that they had some things which, with the\r\ngeneral consent, they wished to ask of him. This request having been\r\ngranted, they appointed a day for the assembly, and ordained by an oath\r\nwith each other, that no one should disclose [their deliberations]\r\nexcept those to whom this [office] should be assigned by the general\r\nassembly.\r\n\r\nXXXI.--When that assembly was dismissed, the same chiefs of states, who\r\nhad before been to Caesar, returned, and asked that they might be\r\nallowed to treat with him privately (in secret) concerning the safety of\r\nthemselves and of all. That request having been obtained, they all threw\r\nthemselves in tears at Caesar's feet, [saying] that they no less begged\r\nand earnestly desired that what they might say should not be disclosed\r\nthan that they might obtain those things which they wished for; inasmuch\r\nas they saw that, if a disclosure were made, they should be put to the\r\ngreatest tortures. For these Divitiacus the Aeduan spoke and told him:--\r\n\"That there were two parties in the whole of Gaul: that the Aedui stood\r\nat the head of one of these, the Arverni of the other. After these had\r\nbeen violently struggling with one another for the superiority for many\r\nyears, it came to pass that the Germans were called in for hire by the\r\nArverni and the Sequani. That about 15,000 of them [_i.e._ of the\r\nGermans] had at first crossed the Rhine: but after that these wild and\r\nsavage men had become enamoured of the lands and the refinement and the\r\nabundance of the Gauls, more were brought over, that there were now as\r\nmany as 120,000 of them in Gaul: that with these the Aedui and their\r\ndependants had repeatedly struggled in arms, that they had been routed\r\nand had sustained a great calamity--had lost all their nobility, all\r\ntheir senate, all their cavalry. And that broken by such engagements and\r\ncalamities, although they had formerly been very powerful in Gaul, both\r\nfrom their own valour and from the Roman people's hospitality and\r\nfriendship, they were now compelled to give the chief nobles of their\r\nstate as hostages to the Sequani, and to bind their state by an oath,\r\nthat they would neither demand hostages in return, nor supplicate aid\r\nfrom the Roman people, nor refuse to be for ever under their sway and\r\nempire. That he was the only one out of all the state of the Aedui who\r\ncould not be prevailed upon to take the oath or to give his children as\r\nhostages. On that account he had fled from his state and had gone to the\r\nsenate at Rome to beseech aid, as he alone was bound neither by oath nor\r\nhostages. But a worse thing had befallen the victorious Sequani than the\r\nvanquished Aedui, for Ariovistus, the king of the Germans, had settled\r\nin their territories, and had seized upon a third of their land, which\r\nwas the best in the whole of Gaul, and was now ordering them to depart\r\nfrom another third part, because a few months previously 24,000 men of\r\nthe Harudes had come to him, for whom room and settlements must be\r\nprovided. The consequence would be, that in a few years they would all\r\nbe driven from the territories of Gaul, and all the Germans would cross\r\nthe Rhine; for neither must the land of Gaul be compared with the land\r\nof the Germans, nor must the habit of living of the latter be put on a\r\nlevel with that of the former. Moreover, [as for] Ariovistus, no sooner\r\ndid he defeat the forces of the Gauls in a battle, which took place at\r\nMagetobria, than [he began] to lord it haughtily and cruelly, to demand\r\nas hostages the children of all the principal nobles, and wreak on them\r\nevery kind of cruelty, if everything was not done at his nod or\r\npleasure; that he was a savage, passionate, and reckless man, and that\r\nhis commands could no longer be borne. Unless there was some aid in\r\nCaesar and the Roman people, the Gauls must all do the same thing that\r\nthe Helvetii had done, [viz.] emigrate from their country, and seek\r\nanother dwelling place, other settlements remote from the Germans, and\r\ntry whatever fortune may fall to their lot. If these things were to be\r\ndisclosed to Ariovistus, [Divitiacus adds] that he doubts not that he\r\nwould inflict the most severe punishment on all the hostages who are in\r\nhis possession, [and says] that Caesar could, either by his own\r\ninfluence and by that of his army, or by his late victory, or by name of\r\nthe Roman people, intimidate him, so as to prevent a greater number of\r\nGermans being brought over the Rhine, and could protect all Gaul from\r\nthe outrages of Ariovistus.\"\r\n\r\nXXXII.--When this speech had been delivered by Divitiacus, all who were\r\npresent began with loud lamentation to entreat assistance of Caesar.\r\nCaesar noticed that the Sequani were the only people of all who did none\r\nof those things which the others did, but, with their heads bowed down,\r\ngazed on the earth in sadness. Wondering what was the reason of this\r\nconduct, he inquired of themselves. No reply did the Sequani make, but\r\nsilently continued in the same sadness. When he had repeatedly\r\ninquired of them and could not elicit any answer at all, the same\r\nDivitiacus the Aeduan answered, that--\"the lot of the Sequani was more\r\nwretched and grievous than that of the rest, on this account, because\r\nthey alone durst not even in secret complain or supplicate aid; and\r\nshuddered at the cruelty of Ariovistus [even when] absent, just as if he\r\nwere present; for, to the rest, despite of everything, there was an\r\nopportunity of flight given; but all tortures must be endured by the\r\nSequani, who had admitted Ariovistus within their territories, and whose\r\ntowns were all in his power.\"\r\n\r\nXXXIII.--Caesar, on being informed of these things, cheered the minds of\r\nthe Gauls with his words, and promised that this affair should be an\r\nobject of his concern, [saying] that he had great hopes that Ariovistus,\r\ninduced both by his kindness and his power, would put an end to his\r\noppression. After delivering this speech, he dismissed the assembly;\r\nand, besides those statements, many circumstances induced him to think\r\nthat this affair ought to be considered and taken up by him; especially\r\nas he saw that the Aedui, styled [as they had been] repeatedly by the\r\nsenate \"brethren\" and \"kinsmen,\" were held in the thraldom and dominion\r\nof the Germans, and understood that their hostages were with Ariovistus\r\nand the Sequani, which in so mighty an empire [as that] of the Roman\r\npeople he considered very disgraceful to himself and the republic. That,\r\nmoreover, the Germans should by degrees become accustomed to cross the\r\nRhine, and that a great body of them should come into Gaul, he saw\r\n[would be] dangerous to the Roman people, and judged that wild and\r\nsavage men would not be likely to restrain themselves, after they had\r\npossessed themselves of all Gaul, from going forth into the province and\r\nthence marching into Italy (as the Cimbri and Teutones had done before\r\nthem), particularly as the Rhone [was the sole barrier that] separated\r\nthe Sequani from our province. Against which events he thought he ought\r\nto provide as speedily as possible. Moreover, Ariovistus, for his part,\r\nhad assumed to himself such pride and arrogance that he was felt to be\r\nquite insufferable.\r\n\r\nXXXIV.--He therefore determined to send ambassadors to Ariovistus to\r\ndemand of him to name some intermediate spot for a conference between\r\nthe two, [saying] that he wished to treat with him on state-business and\r\nmatters of the highest importance to both of them. To this embassy\r\nAriovistus replied, that if he himself had had need of anything from\r\nCaesar, he would have gone to him; and that if Caesar wanted anything\r\nfrom him he ought to come to him. That, besides, neither dare he go\r\nwithout an army into those parts of Gaul which Caesar had possession of,\r\nnor could he, without great expense and trouble, draw his army together\r\nto one place; that to him, moreover, it appeared strange what business\r\neither Caesar or the Roman people at all had in his own Gaul, which he\r\nhad conquered in war.\r\n\r\nXXXV.--When these answers were reported to Caesar, he sends ambassadors\r\nto him a second time with this message \"Since, after having been treated\r\nwith so much kindness by himself and the Roman people (as he had in his\r\nconsulship [B.C. 59] been styled 'king and friend' by the senate), he\r\nmakes this recompense to [Caesar] himself and the Roman people, [viz.]\r\nthat when invited to a conference he demurs, and does not think that it\r\nconcerns him to advise and inform himself about an object of mutual\r\ninterest, these are the things which he requires of him; first, that he\r\ndo not any more bring over any body of men across the Rhine into Gaul;\r\nin the next place, that he restore the hostages which he has from the\r\nAedui, and grant the Sequani permission to restore to them with his\r\nconsent those hostages which they have, and that he neither provoke the\r\nAedui by outrage nor make war upon them or their allies; if he would\r\naccordingly do this,\" [Caesar says] that \"he himself and the Roman\r\npeople will entertain a perpetual feeling of favour and friendship\r\ntowards him; but that if he [Caesar] does not obtain [his desires], that\r\nhe (forasmuch as in the consulship of Marcus Messala and Marcus Piso\r\n[B.C. 61] the senate had decreed that, whoever should have the\r\nadministration of the province of Gaul should, as far as he could do so\r\nconsistently with the interests of the republic, protect the Aedui and\r\nthe other friends of the Roman people) will not overlook the wrongs of\r\nthe Aedui.\"\r\n\r\nXXXVI.--To this Ariovistus replied, that \"the right of war was, that\r\nthey who had conquered should govern those whom they had conquered, in\r\nwhat manner they pleased; that in that way the Roman people were wont to\r\ngovern the nations which they had conquered, not according to the\r\ndictation of any other, but according to their own discretion. If he for\r\nhis part did not dictate to the Roman people as to the manner in which\r\nthey were to exercise their right, he ought not to be obstructed by the\r\nRoman people in his right; that the Aedui, inasmuch as they had tried\r\nthe fortune of war and had engaged in arms and been conquered, had\r\nbecome tributaries to him; that Caesar was doing a great injustice, in\r\nthat by his arrival he was making his revenues less valuable to him;\r\nthat he should not restore their hostages to the Aedui, but should not\r\nmake war wrongfully either upon them or their allies, if they abided by\r\nthat which had been agreed on, and paid their tribute annually: if they\r\ndid _not_ continue to do that, the Roman people's name of 'brothers'\r\nwould avail them nought. As to Caesar's threatening him that be would\r\nnot overlook the wrongs of the Aedui, [he said] that no one had ever\r\nentered into a contest with _him_ [Ariovistus] without utter ruin to\r\nhimself. That Caesar might enter the lists when he chose; he would feel\r\nwhat the invincible Germans, well-trained [as they were] beyond all\r\nothers to arms, who for fourteen years had not been beneath a roof,\r\ncould achieve by their valour.\"\r\n\r\nXXXVII.--At the same time that this message was delivered to Caesar,\r\nambassadors came from the Aedui and the Treviri; from the Aedui to\r\ncomplain that the Harudes, who had lately been brought over into Gaul,\r\nwere ravaging their territories; that they had not been able to purchase\r\npeace from Ariovistus, even by giving hostages: and from the Treviri,\r\n[to state] that a hundred cantons of the Suevi had encamped on the banks\r\nof the Rhine, and were attempting to cross it; that the brothers, Nasuas\r\nand Cimberius, headed them. Being greatly alarmed at these things,\r\nCaesar thought that he ought to use all despatch, lest, if this new band\r\nof Suevi should unite with the old troops of Ariovistus, he [Ariovistus]\r\nmight be less easily withstood. Having, therefore, as quickly as he\r\ncould, provided a supply of corn, he hastened to Ariovistus by forced\r\nmarches.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII.--When he had proceeded three days' journey, word was brought to\r\nhim that Ariovistus was hastening with all his forces to seize on\r\nVesontio, which is the largest town of the Sequani, and had advanced\r\nthree days' journey from his territories. Caesar thought that he ought\r\nto take the greatest precautions lest this should happen, for there was\r\nin that town a most ample supply of everything which was serviceable for\r\nwar; and so fortified was it by the nature of the ground as to afford a\r\ngreat facility for protracting the war, inasmuch as the river Doubs\r\nalmost surrounds the whole town, as though it were traced round it with\r\na pair of compasses. A mountain of great height shuts in the remaining\r\nspace, which is not more than 600 feet, where the river leaves a gap, in\r\nsuch a manner that the roots of that mountain extend to the river's bank\r\non either side. A wall thrown around it makes a citadel of this\r\n[mountain], and connects it with the town. Hither Caesar hastens by\r\nforced marches by night and day, and, after having seized the town,\r\nstations a garrison there.\r\n\r\nXXXIX.--Whilst he is tarrying a few days at Vesontio, on account of corn\r\nand provisions; from the inquiries of our men and the reports of the\r\nGauls and traders (who asserted that the Germans were men of huge\r\nstature, of incredible valour and practice in arms, that ofttimes they,\r\non encountering them, could not bear even their countenance, and the\r\nfierceness of their eyes)--so great a panic on a sudden seized the whole\r\narmy, as to discompose the minds and spirits of all in no slight degree.\r\nThis first arose from the tribunes of the soldiers, the prefects and the\r\nrest, who, having followed Caesar from the city [Rome] from motives of\r\nfriendship, had no great experience in military affairs. And alleging,\r\nsome of them one reason, some another, which they said made it necessary\r\nfor them to depart, they requested that by his consent they might be\r\nallowed to withdraw; some, influenced by shame, stayed behind in order\r\nthat they might avoid the suspicion of cowardice. These could neither\r\ncompose their countenance, nor even sometimes check their tears: but\r\nhidden in their tents, either bewailed their fate, or deplored with\r\ntheir comrades the general danger. Wills were sealed universally\r\nthroughout the whole camp. By the expressions and cowardice of these\r\nmen, even those who possessed great experience in the camp, both\r\nsoldiers and centurions, and those [the decurions] who were in command\r\nof the cavalry, were gradually disconcerted. Such of them as wished to\r\nbe considered less alarmed, said that they did not dread the enemy, but\r\nfeared the narrowness of the roads and the vastness of the forests which\r\nlay between them and Ariovistus, or else that the supplies could not be\r\nbrought up readily enough. Some even declared to Caesar that when he\r\ngave orders for the camp to be moved and the troops to advance, the\r\nsoldiers would not be obedient to the command, nor advance in\r\nconsequence of their fear.\r\n\r\nXL.--When Caesar observed these things, having called a council, and\r\nsummoned to it the centurions of all the companies, he severely\r\nreprimanded them, \"particularly for supposing that it belonged to them\r\nto inquire or conjecture, either in what direction they were marching,\r\nor with what object. That Ariovistus, during his [Caesar's] consulship,\r\nhad most anxiously sought after the friendship of the Roman people; why\r\nshould any one judge that he would so rashly depart from his duty? He\r\nfor his part was persuaded that, when his demands were known and the\r\nfairness of the terms considered, he would reject neither his nor the\r\nRoman people's favour. But even if, driven on by rage and madness, he\r\nshould make war upon them, what after all were they afraid of?--or why\r\nshould they despair either of their own valour or of his zeal? Of that\r\nenemy a trial had been made within our fathers' recollection, when, on\r\nthe defeat of the Cimbri and Teutones by Caius Marius, the army was\r\nregarded as having deserved no less praise than their commander himself.\r\nIt had been made lately, too, in Italy; during the rebellion of the\r\nslaves, whom, however, the experience and training which they had\r\nreceived from us, assisted in some respect. From which a judgment might\r\nbe formed of the advantages which resolution carries with it,--inasmuch\r\nas those whom for some time they had groundlessly dreaded when unarmed,\r\nthey had afterwards vanquished, when well armed and flushed with\r\nsuccess. In short, that these were the same men whom the Helvetii, in\r\nfrequent encounters, not only in their own territories, but also in\r\ntheirs [the German], have generally vanquished, and yet cannot have been\r\na match for our army. If the unsuccessful battle and flight of the Gauls\r\ndisquieted any, these, if they made inquiries, might discover that, when\r\nthe Gauls had been tired out by the long duration of the war,\r\nAriovistus, after he had many months kept himself in his camp and in the\r\nmarshes, and had given no opportunity for an engagement, fell suddenly\r\nupon them, by this time despairing of a battle and scattered in all\r\ndirections, and was victorious more through stratagem and cunning than\r\nvalour. But though there had been room for such stratagem against savage\r\nand unskilled men, not even [Ariovistus] himself expected that thereby\r\nour armies could be entrapped. That those who ascribed their fear to a\r\npretence about the [deficiency of] supplies and the narrowness of the\r\nroads, acted presumptuously, as they seemed either to distrust their\r\ngeneral's discharge of his duty, or to dictate to him. That these things\r\nwere his concern; that the Sequani, the Leuci, and the Lingones were to\r\nfurnish the corn; and that it was already ripe in the fields; that as to\r\nthe road they would soon be able to judge for themselves. As to its\r\nbeing reported that the soldiers would not be obedient to command, or\r\nadvance, he was not at all disturbed at that; for he knew that in the\r\ncase of all those whose army had not been obedient to command, either\r\nupon some mismanagement of an affair, fortune had deserted them, or,\r\nthat upon some crime being discovered, covetousness had been clearly\r\nproved [against them]. His integrity had been seen throughout his whole\r\nlife, his good fortune in the war with the Helvetii. That he would\r\ntherefore instantly set about what he had intended to put off till a\r\nmore distant day, and would break up his camp the next night, in the\r\nfourth watch, that he might ascertain, as soon as possible, whether a\r\nsense of honour and duty, or whether fear had more influence with them.\r\nBut that, if no one else should follow, yet he would go with only the\r\ntenth legion, of which he had no misgivings, and it should be his\r\npraetorian cohort.\"--This legion Caesar had both greatly favoured, and\r\nin it, on account of its valour, placed the greatest confidence.\r\n\r\nXLI.-Upon the delivery of this speech, the minds of all were changed in\r\na surprising, manner, and the highest ardour and eagerness for\r\nprosecuting the war were engendered; and the tenth legion was the first\r\nto return thanks to him, through their military tribunes, for his having\r\nexpressed this most favourable opinion of them; and assured him that\r\nthey were quite ready to prosecute the war. Then, the other legions\r\nendeavoured, through their military tribunes and the centurions of the\r\nprincipal companies, to excuse themselves to Caesar, [saying] that they\r\nhad never either doubted or feared, or supposed that the determination\r\nof the conduct of the war was theirs and not their general's. Having\r\naccepted their excuse, and having had the road carefully reconnoitred by\r\nDivitiacus, because in him of all others he had the greatest faith, [he\r\nfound] that by a circuitous route of more than fifty miles he might lead\r\nhis army through open parts; he then set out in the fourth watch, as he\r\nhad said [he would]. On the seventh day, as he did not discontinue his\r\nmarch, he was informed by scouts that the forces of Ariovistus were only\r\nfour and twenty miles distant from ours.\r\n\r\nXLII.--Upon being apprised of Caesar's arrival, Ariovistus sends\r\nambassadors to him, [saying] that what he had before requested as to a\r\nconference, might now, as far as his permission went, take place, since\r\nhe [Caesar] had approached nearer, and he considered that he might now\r\ndo it without danger. Caesar did not reject the proposal and began to\r\nthink that he was now returning to a rational state of mind, as he\r\nspontaneously proffered that which he had previously refused to him when\r\nrequesting it; and was in great hopes that, in consideration of his own\r\nand the Roman people's great favours towards him, the issue would be\r\nthat he would desist from his obstinacy upon his demands being made\r\nknown. The fifth day after that was appointed as the day of conference.\r\nMeanwhile, as ambassadors were being often sent to and fro between them,\r\nAriovistus demanded that Caesar should not bring any foot-soldier with\r\nhim to the conference, [saying] that \"he was afraid of being ensnared by\r\nhim through treachery; that both should come accompanied by cavalry;\r\nthat he would not come on any other condition.\" Caesar, as he neither\r\nwished that the conference should, by an excuse thrown in the way, be\r\nset aside, nor durst trust his life to the cavalry of the Gauls, decided\r\nthat it would be most expedient to take away from the Gallic cavalry all\r\ntheir horses, and thereon to mount the legionary soldiers of the tenth\r\nlegion, in which he placed the greatest confidence; in order that he\r\nmight have a body-guard as trustworthy as possible, should there be any\r\nneed for action. And when this was done, one of the soldiers of the\r\ntenth legion said, not without a touch of humour, \"that Caesar did more\r\nfor them than he had promised; he had promised to have the tenth legion\r\nin place of his praetorian cohort; but he now converted them into\r\nhorse.\"\r\n\r\nXLIII.--There was a large plain, and in it a mound of earth of\r\nconsiderable size. This spot was at nearly an equal distance from both\r\ncamps. Thither, as had been appointed, they came for the conference.\r\nCaesar stationed the legion, which he had brought [with him] on\r\nhorseback, 200 paces from this mound. The cavalry of Ariovistus also\r\ntook their stand at an equal distance. Ariovistus then demanded that\r\nthey should confer on horseback, and that, besides themselves, they\r\nshould bring with them ten men each to the conference. When they were\r\ncome to the place, Caesar, in the opening of his speech, detailed his\r\nown and the senate's favours towards him [Ariovistus], \"in that he had\r\nbeen styled king, in that [he had been styled] friend, by the senate--\r\nin that very considerable presents had been sent him; which circumstance\r\nhe informed him had both fallen to the lot of few, and had usually been\r\nbestowed in consideration of important personal services; that he,\r\nalthough he had neither an introduction, nor a just ground for the\r\nrequest, had obtained these honours through the kindness and munificence\r\nof himself [Caesar] and the senate. He informed him too, how old and how\r\njust were the grounds of connexion that existed between themselves [the\r\nRomans] and the Aedui, what decrees of the senate had been passed in\r\ntheir favour, and how frequent and how honourable; how from time\r\nimmemorial the Aedui had held the supremacy of the whole of Gaul; even\r\n[said Caesar] before they had sought our friendship; that it was the\r\ncustom of the Roman people to desire not only that its allies and\r\nfriends should lose none of their property, but be advanced in\r\ninfluence, dignity, and honour: who then could endure that what they had\r\nbrought with them to the friendship of the Roman people, should be torn\r\nfrom them?\" He then made the same demands which he had commissioned the\r\nambassadors to make, that [Ariovistus] should not make war either upon\r\nthe Aedui or their allies, that he should restore the hostages; that, if\r\nhe could not send back to their country any part of the Germans, he\r\nshould at all events suffer none of them any more to cross the Rhine.\r\n\r\nXLIV.--Ariovistus replied briefly to the demands of Caesar; but\r\nexpatiated largely on his own virtues, \"that he had crossed the Rhine\r\nnot of his own accord, but on being invited and sent for by the Gauls;\r\nthat he had not left home and kindred without great expectations and\r\ngreat rewards; that he had settlements in Gaul, granted by the Gauls\r\nthemselves; that the hostages had been given by their own good-will;\r\nthat he took by right of war the tribute which conquerors are accustomed\r\nto impose on the conquered; that he had not made war upon the Gauls, but\r\nthe Gauls upon him; that all the states of Gaul came to attack him, and\r\nhad encamped against him; that all their forces had been routed and\r\nbeaten by him in a single battle; that if they chose to make a second\r\ntrial, he was ready to encounter them again; but if they chose to enjoy\r\npeace, it was unfair to refuse the tribute, which of their own free-will\r\nthey had paid up to that time. That the friendship of the Roman people\r\nought to prove to him an ornament and a safeguard, not a detriment; and\r\nthat he sought it with that expectation. But if through the Roman people\r\nthe tribute was to be discontinued, and those who surrendered to be\r\nseduced from him, he would renounce the friendship of the Roman people\r\nno less heartily than he had sought it. As to his leading over a host of\r\nGermans into Gaul, that he was doing this with a view of securing\r\nhimself, not of assaulting Gaul: that there was evidence of this, in\r\nthat he did not come without being invited, and in that he did not make\r\nwar, but merely warded it off. That he had come into Gaul before the\r\nRoman people. That never before this time did a Roman army go beyond the\r\nfrontiers of the province of Gaul. What [said he] does [Caesar] desire?\r\n--why come into his [Ariovistus's] domains?--that this was his province\r\nof Gaul, just as that is ours. As it ought not to be pardoned in him, if\r\nhe were to make an attack upon our territories; so, likewise, that we\r\nwere unjust to obstruct him in his prerogative. As for Caesar's saying\r\nthat the Aedui had been styled 'brethren' by the senate, he was not so\r\nuncivilized nor so ignorant of affairs, as not to know that the Aedui in\r\nthe very last war with the Allobroges had neither rendered assistance to\r\nthe Romans, nor received any from the Roman people in the struggles\r\nwhich the Aedui had been maintaining with him and with the Sequani. He\r\nmust feel suspicious that Caesar, though feigning friendship as the\r\nreason for his keeping an army in Gaul; was keeping it with the view of\r\ncrushing him. And that unless he depart, and withdraw his army from\r\nthese parts, he shall regard him not as a friend, but as a foe; and\r\nthat, even if he should put him to death, he should do what would please\r\nmany of the nobles and leading men of the Roman people; he had assurance\r\nof that from themselves through their messengers, and could purchase the\r\nfavour and the friendship of them all by his [Caesar's] death. But if he\r\nwould depart and resign to him the free possession of Gaul, he would\r\nrecompense him with a great reward, and would bring to a close whatever\r\nwars he wished to be carried on, without any trouble or risk to him.\"\r\n\r\nXLV.--Many things were stated by Caesar to the effect [to show]: \"why he\r\ncould not waive the business, and that neither his nor the Roman\r\npeople's practice would suffer him to abandon most meritorious allies,\r\nnor did he deem that Gaul belonged to Ariovistus rather than to the\r\nRoman people; that the Arverni and the Ruteni had been subdued in war by\r\nQuintus Fabius Maximus, and that the Roman people had pardoned them and\r\nhad not reduced them into a province or imposed a tribute upon them. And\r\nif the most ancient period was to be regarded--then was the sovereignty\r\nof the Roman people in Gaul most just: if the decree of the senate was\r\nto be observed, then ought Gaul to be free, which they [the Romans] had\r\nconquered in war, and had permitted to enjoy its own laws.\"\r\n\r\nXLVI.--While these things are being transacted in the conference, it was\r\nannounced to Caesar that the cavalry of Ariovistus were approaching\r\nnearer the mound, and were riding up to our men, and casting stones and\r\nweapons at them. Caesar made an end of his speech and betook himself to\r\nhis men; and commanded them that they should by no means return a weapon\r\nupon the enemy. For though he saw that an engagement with the cavalry\r\nwould be without any danger to his chosen legion, yet he did not think\r\nproper to engage, lest, after the enemy were routed, it might be said\r\nthat they had been ensnared by him under the sanction of a conference.\r\nWhen it was spread abroad among the common soldiery with what\r\nhaughtiness Ariovistus had behaved at the conference, and how he had\r\nordered the Romans to quit Gaul, and how his cavalry had made an attack\r\nupon our men, and how this had broken off the conference, a much greater\r\nalacrity and eagerness for battle was infused into our army.\r\n\r\nXLVII.--Two days after, Ariovistus sends ambassadors to Caesar, to state\r\n\"that he wished to treat with him about those things which had been\r\nbegun to be treated of between them, but had not been concluded\"; [and\r\nto beg] that \"he would either again appoint a day for a conference; or,\r\nif he were not willing to do that, that he would send one of his\r\n[officers] as an ambassador to him.\" There did not appear to Caesar any\r\ngood reason for holding a conference; and the more so as the day before\r\nthe Germans could not be restrained from casting weapons at our men. He\r\nthought he should not without great danger send to him as ambassador one\r\nof his [Roman] officers, and should expose him to savage men. It seemed\r\n[therefore] most proper to send to him C. Valerius Procillus, the son of\r\nC. Valerius Caburus, a young man of the highest courage and\r\naccomplishments (whose father had been presented with the freedom of the\r\ncity by C. Valerius Flaccus), both on account of his fidelity and on\r\naccount of his knowledge of the Gallic language, which Ariovistus, by\r\nlong practice, now spoke fluently; and because in his case the Germans\r\nwould have no motive for committing violence; and [as his colleague] M.\r\nMettius, who had shared the hospitality of Ariovistus. He commissioned\r\nthem to learn what Ariovistus had to say, and to report to him. But when\r\nAriovistus saw them before him in his camp, he cried out in the presence\r\nof his army, \"Why were they come to him? was it for the purpose of\r\nacting as spies?\" He stopped them when attempting to speak, and cast\r\nthem into chains.\r\n\r\nXLVIII.--The same day he moved his camp forward and pitched under a hill\r\nsix miles from Caesar's camp. The day following he led his forces past\r\nCaesar's camp, and encamped two miles beyond him; with this design--that\r\nhe might cut off Caesar from, the corn and provisions which might be\r\nconveyed to him from the Sequani and the Aedui. For five successive days\r\nfrom that day, Caesar drew out his forces before the camp, and put them\r\nin battle order, that, if Ariovistus should be willing to engage in\r\nbattle, an opportunity might not be wanting to him. Ariovistus all this\r\ntime kept his army in camp: but engaged daily in cavalry skirmishes. The\r\nmethod of battle in which the Germans had practised themselves was this.\r\nThere were 6000 horse, and as many very active and courageous foot, one\r\nof whom each of the horse selected out of the whole army for his own\r\nprotection. By these [foot] they were constantly accompanied in their\r\nengagements; to these the horse retired; these on any emergency rushed\r\nforward; if any one, upon receiving a very severe wound, had fallen from\r\nhis horse, they stood around him: if it was necessary to advance\r\nfarther: than usual, or to retreat more rapidly, so great, from\r\npractice, was their swiftness, that, supported by the manes of the\r\nhorses, they could keep pace with their speed.\r\n\r\nXLIX.--Perceiving that Ariovistus kept himself in camp, Caesar, that he\r\nmight not any longer be cut off from provisions, chose a convenient\r\nposition for a camp beyond that place in which the Germans had encamped,\r\nat about 600 paces from them, and having drawn up his army in three\r\nlines, marched to that place. He ordered the first and second lines to\r\nbe under arms; the third to fortify the camp. This place was distant\r\nfrom the enemy about 600 paces, as has been stated. Thither Ariovistus\r\nsent light troops, about 16,000 men in number, with all his cavalry;\r\nwhich forces were to intimidate our men, and hinder them in their\r\nfortification. Caesar nevertheless, as he had before arranged, ordered\r\ntwo lines to drive off the enemy: the third to execute the work. The\r\ncamp being fortified, he left there two legions and a portion of the\r\nauxiliaries; and led back the other four legions into the larger camp.\r\n\r\nL.--The next day, according to his custom, Caesar led out his forces\r\nfrom both camps, and having advanced a little from the larger one, drew\r\nup his line of battle, and gave the enemy an opportunity of fighting.\r\nWhen he found that they did not even then come out [from their\r\nentrenchments], he led back his army into camp about noon. Then at last\r\nAriovistus sent part of his forces to attack the lesser camp. The battle\r\nwas vigorously maintained on both sides till the evening. At sunset,\r\nafter many wounds had been inflicted and received, Ariovistus led back\r\nhis forces into camp. When Caesar inquired of his prisoners, wherefore\r\nAriovistus did not come to an engagement, he discovered this to be the\r\nreason--that among the Germans it was the custom for their matrons to\r\npronounce from lots and divination whether it were expedient that the\r\nbattle should be engaged in or not; that they had said, \"that it was not\r\nthe will of heaven that the Germans should conquer, if they engaged in\r\nbattle before the new moon.\"\r\n\r\nLI.--The day following, Caesar left what seemed sufficient as a guard\r\nfor both camps; [and then] drew up all the auxiliaries in sight of the\r\nenemy, before the lesser camp, because he was not very powerful in the\r\nnumber of legionary soldiers, considering the number of the enemy; that\r\n[thereby] he might make use of his auxiliaries for appearance. He\r\nhimself, having drawn up his army in three lines, advanced to the camp\r\nof the enemy. Then at last of necessity the Germans drew their forces\r\nout of camp, and disposed them canton by canton, at equal distances, the\r\nHarudes, Marcomanni, Tribocci, Vangiones, Nemetes, Sedusii, Suevi; and\r\nsurrounded their whole army with their chariots and waggons, that no\r\nhope might be left in flight. On these they placed their women, who,\r\nwith dishevelled hair and in tears, entreated the soldiers, as they went\r\nforward to battle, not to deliver them into slavery to the Romans.\r\n\r\nLII.--Caesar appointed over each legion a lieutenant and a questor, that\r\nevery one might have them as witnesses of his valour. He himself began\r\nthe battle at the head of the right wing, because he had observed that\r\npart of the enemy to be the least strong. Accordingly our men, upon the\r\nsignal being given, vigorously made an attack upon the enemy, and the\r\nenemy so suddenly and rapidly rushed forward, that there was no time for\r\ncasting the javelins at them. Throwing aside [therefore] their javelins,\r\nthey fought with swords hand to hand. But the Germans, according to\r\ntheir custom, rapidly forming a phalanx, sustained the attack of our\r\nswords. There were found very many of our soldiers who leaped upon the\r\nphalanx, and with their hands tore away the shields, and wounded the\r\nenemy from above. Although the army of the enemy was routed on the left\r\nwing and put to flight, they [still] pressed heavily on our men from the\r\nright wing, by the great number of their troops. On observing which, P.\r\nCrassus, a young man, who commanded the cavalry--as he was more\r\ndisengaged than those who were employed in the fight--sent the third\r\nline as a relief to our men who were in distress.\r\n\r\nLIII.--Thereupon the engagement was renewed, and all the enemy turned\r\ntheir backs, nor did they cease to flee until they arrived at the river\r\nRhine, about fifty miles from that place. There some few, either relying\r\non their strength, endeavoured to swim over, or, finding boats, procured\r\ntheir safety. Among the latter was Ariovistus, who meeting with a small\r\nvessel tied to the bank, escaped in it: our horse pursued and slew all\r\nthe rest of them. Ariovistus had two wives, one a Suevan by nation, whom\r\nhe had brought with him from home; the other a Norican, the sister of\r\nking Vocion, whom he had married in Gaul, she having been sent [thither\r\nfor that purpose] by her brother. Both perished in that flight. Of their\r\ntwo daughters, one was slain, the other captured. C. Valerius Procillus,\r\nas he was being dragged by his guards in the flight, bound with a triple\r\nchain, fell into the hands of Caesar himself, as he was pursuing the\r\nenemy with his cavalry. This circumstance indeed afforded Caesar no less\r\npleasure than the victory itself; because he saw a man of the first rank\r\nin the province of Gaul, his intimate acquaintance and friend, rescued\r\nfrom the hand of the enemy, and restored to him, and that fortune had\r\nnot diminished aught of the joy and exultation [of that day] by his\r\ndestruction. He [Procillus] said that in his own presence the lots had\r\nbeen thrice consulted respecting him, whether he should immediately be\r\nput to death by fire, or be reserved for another time: that by the\r\nfavour of the lots he was uninjured. M. Mettius, also, was found and\r\nbrought back to him [Caesar].\r\n\r\nLIV.--This battle having been reported beyond the Rhine, the Suevi, who\r\nhad come to the banks of that river, began to return home, when the\r\nUbii, who dwelt nearest to the Rhine, pursuing them, while much alarmed,\r\nslew a great number of them. Caesar having concluded two very important\r\nwars in one campaign, conducted his army into winter quarters among the\r\nSequani, a little earlier than the season of the year required. He\r\nappointed Labienus over the winter quarters, and set out in person for\r\nHither Gaul to hold the assizes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\nI.--While Caesar was in winter quarters in Hither Gaul, as we have shown\r\nabove, frequent reports were brought to him, and he was also informed by\r\nletters from Labienus, that all the Belgae, who we have said are a third\r\npart of Gaul, were entering into a confederacy against the Roman people,\r\nand giving hostages to one another; that the reasons of the confederacy\r\nwere these--first, because they feared that, after all [Celtic] Gaul was\r\nsubdued, our army would be led against them; secondly, because they were\r\ninstigated by several of the Gauls; some of whom as [on the one hand]\r\nthey had been unwilling that the Germans should remain any longer in\r\nGaul, so [on the other] they were dissatisfied that the army of the\r\nRoman people should pass the winter in it, and settle there; and others\r\nof them, from a natural instability and fickleness of disposition, were\r\nanxious for a revolution; [the Belgae were instigated] by several, also,\r\nbecause the government in Gaul was generally seized upon by the more\r\npowerful persons and by those who had the means of hiring troops, and\r\nthey could less easily effect this object under our dominion.\r\n\r\nII.--Alarmed by these tidings and letters, Caesar levied two new legions\r\nin Hither Gaul, and, at the beginning of summer, sent Q. Pedius, his\r\nlieutenant, to conduct them further into Gaul. He himself, as soon as\r\nthere began to be plenty of forage, came to the army. He gives a\r\ncommission to the Senones and the other Gauls who were neighbours of the\r\nBelgae, to learn what is going on amongst them [_i.e._ the Belgae], and\r\ninform him of these matters. These all uniformly reported that troops\r\nwere being raised, and that an army was being collected in one place.\r\nThen, indeed, he thought that he ought not to hesitate about proceeding\r\ntowards them, and having provided supplies, moves his camp, and in about\r\nfifteen days arrives at the territories of the Belgae.\r\n\r\nIII.--As he arrived there unexpectedly and sooner than any one\r\nanticipated, the Remi, who are the nearest of the Belgae to [Celtic]\r\nGaul, sent to him Iccius and Antebrogius, [two of] the principal persons\r\nof the state, as their ambassadors: to tell him that they surrendered\r\nthemselves and all their possessions to the protection and disposal of\r\nthe Roman people: and that they had neither combined with the rest of\r\nthe Belgae, nor entered into any confederacy against the Roman people:\r\nand were prepared to give hostages, to obey his commands, to receive him\r\ninto their towns, and to aid him with corn and other things; that all\r\nthe rest of the Belgae were in arms; and that the Germans, who dwell on\r\nthis side the Rhine, had joined themselves to them; and that so great\r\nwas the infatuation of them all that they could not restrain even the\r\nSuessiones, their own brethren and kinsmen, who enjoy the same rights,\r\nand the same laws, and who have one government and one magistracy [in\r\ncommon] with themselves, from uniting with them.\r\n\r\nIV.--When Caesar inquired of them what states were in arms, how powerful\r\nthey were, and what they could do in war, he received the following\r\ninformation: that the greater part of the Belgae were sprung from the\r\nGermans, and that having crossed the Rhine at an early period, they had\r\nsettled there, on account of the fertility of the country, and had\r\ndriven out the Gauls who inhabited those regions; and that they were the\r\nonly people who, in the memory of our fathers, when all Gaul was\r\noverrun, had prevented the Teutones and the Cimbri from entering their\r\nterritories; the effect of which was that, from the recollection of\r\nthose events, they assumed to themselves great authority and haughtiness\r\nin military matters. The Remi said that they had known accurately\r\neverything respecting their number, because, being united to them by\r\nneighbourhood and by alliances, they had learnt what number each state\r\nhad in the general council of the Belgae promised for that war. That the\r\nBellovaci were the most powerful amongst them in valour, influence, and\r\nnumber of men; that these could muster 100,000 armed men, [and had]\r\npromised 60,000 picked men out of that number, and demanded for\r\nthemselves the command of the whole war. That the Suessiones were their\r\nnearest neighbours and possessed a very extensive and fertile country;\r\nthat among them, even in our own memory, Divitiacus, the most powerful\r\nman of all Gaul, had been king; who had held the government of a great\r\npart of these regions, as well as of Britain; that their king at present\r\nwas Galba; that the direction of the whole war was conferred by the\r\nconsent of all upon him, on account of his integrity and prudence; that\r\nthey had twelve towns; that they had promised 50,000 armed men; and that\r\nthe Nervii, who are reckoned the most warlike among them, and are\r\nsituated at a very great distance, [had promised] as many; the\r\nAtrebates, 15,000; the Ambiani, 10,000; the Morini, 25,000; the Menapu,\r\n9000; the Caleti, 10,000; the Velocasses and the Veromandui as many; the\r\nAduatuci, 19,000; that the Condrusi, the Eburones, the Caeraesi, the\r\nPaemani, who are called by the common name of Germans, [had promised],\r\nthey thought, to the number of 40,000.\r\n\r\nV.--Caesar, having encouraged the Remi, and addressed them courteously,\r\nordered the whole senate to assemble before him, and the children of\r\ntheir chief men to be brought to him as hostages; all which commands\r\nthey punctually performed by the day [appointed]. He, addressing himself\r\nto Divitiacus the Aeduan, with great earnestness, points out how much it\r\nconcerns the republic and their common security, that the forces of the\r\nenemy should be divided, so that it might not be necessary to engage\r\nwith so large a number at one time. [He asserts] that this might be\r\neffected if the Aedui would lead their forces into the territories of\r\nthe Bellovaci, and begin to lay waste their country. With these\r\ninstructions he dismissed him from his presence. After he perceived that\r\nall the forces of the Belgae, which had been collected in one place,\r\nwere approaching towards him, and learnt from the scouts whom he had\r\nsent out, and [also] from the Remi, that they were not then far distant,\r\nhe hastened to lead his army over the Aisne, which is on the borders of\r\nthe Remi, and there pitched his camp. This position fortified one side\r\nof his camp by the banks of the river, rendered the country which lay in\r\nhis rear secure from the enemy, and furthermore ensured that provisions\r\nmight without danger be brought to him by the Remi and the rest of the\r\nstates. Over that river was a bridge: there he places a guard; and on\r\nthe other side of the river he leaves Q. Titurus Sabinus, his\r\nlieutenant, with six cohorts. He orders him to fortify a camp with a\r\nrampart twelve feet in height, and a trench eighteen feet in breadth.\r\n\r\nVI.--There was a town of the Remi, by name Bibrax, eight miles distant\r\nfrom this camp. This the Belgae on their march began to attack with\r\ngreat vigour. [The assault] was with difficulty sustained for that day.\r\nThe Gauls' mode of besieging is the same as that of the Belgae: when\r\nafter having drawn a large number of men around the whole of the\r\nfortifications, stones have begun to be cast against the wall on all\r\nsides, and the wall has been stript of its defenders, [then], forming a\r\ntestudo, they advance to the gates and undermine the wall: which was\r\neasily effected on this occasion; for while so large a number were\r\ncasting stones and darts, no one was able to maintain his position upon\r\nthe wall. When night had put an end to the assault, Iccius, who was then\r\nin command of the town, one of the Remi, a man of the highest rank and\r\ninfluence amongst his people, and one of those who had come to Caesar as\r\nambassador [to sue] for a peace, sends messengers to him, [to report]\r\n\"That, unless assistance were sent to him, he could not hold out any\r\nlonger.\"\r\n\r\nVII.--Thither immediately after midnight, Caesar, using as guides the\r\nsame persons who had come to him as messengers from Iccius, sends some\r\nNumidian and Cretan archers, and some Balearian slingers as a relief to\r\nthe townspeople, by whose arrival both a desire to resist together with\r\nthe hope of [making good their] defence was infused into the Remi, and,\r\nfor the same reason, the hope of gaining the town abandoned the enemy.\r\nTherefore, after staying a short time before the town, and laying waste\r\nthe country of the Remi, when all the villages and buildings which they\r\ncould approach had been burnt, they hastened with all their forces to\r\nthe camp of Caesar, and encamped within less than two miles [of it]; and\r\ntheir camp, as was indicated by the smoke and fires, extended more than\r\neight miles in breadth.\r\n\r\nVIII.--Caesar at first determined to decline a battle, as well on\r\naccount of the great number of the enemy as their distinguished\r\nreputation for valour: daily, however, in cavalry actions, he strove to\r\nascertain by frequent trials what the enemy could effect by their\r\nprowess and what our men would dare. When he perceived that our men were\r\nnot inferior, as the place before the camp was naturally convenient and\r\nsuitable for marshalling an army (since the hill where the camp was\r\npitched, rising gradually from the plain, extended forward in breadth as\r\nfar as the space which the marshalled army could occupy, and had steep\r\ndeclines of its side in either direction, and gently sloping in front\r\ngradually sank to the plain), on either side of that hill he drew a\r\ncross trench of about four hundred paces, and at the extremities of that\r\ntrench built forts, and placed there his military engines, lest, after\r\nhe had marshalled his army, the enemy, since they were so powerful in\r\npoint of number, should be able to surround his men in the flank, while\r\nfighting. After doing this, and leaving in the camp the two legions\r\nwhich he had last raised, that, if there should be any occasion, they\r\nmight be brought as a reserve, he formed the other six legions in order\r\nof battle before the camp. The enemy, likewise, had drawn up their\r\nforces which they had brought out of the camp.\r\n\r\nIX.--There was a marsh of no great extent between our army and that of\r\nthe enemy. The latter were waiting to see if our men would pass this;\r\nour men, also, were ready in arms to attack them while disordered, if\r\nthe first attempt to pass should be made by them. In the meantime battle\r\nwas commenced between the two armies by a cavalry action. When neither\r\narmy began to pass the marsh, Caesar, upon the skirmishes of the horse\r\n[proving] favourable to our men, led back his forces into the camp. The\r\nenemy immediately hastened from that place to the river Aisne, which it\r\nhas been stated was behind our camp. Finding a ford there, they\r\nendeavoured to lead a part of their forces over it; with the design,\r\nthat, if they could, they might carry by storm the fort which Q.\r\nTiturius, Caesar's lieutenant, commanded, and might cut off the bridge;\r\nbut, if they could not do that, they should lay waste the lands of the\r\nRemi, which were of great use to us in carrying on the war, and might\r\nhinder our men from foraging.\r\n\r\nX.--Caesar, being apprised of this by Titurius, leads all his cavalry\r\nand light-armed Numidians, slingers and archers, over the bridge, and\r\nhastens towards them. There was a severe struggle in that place. Our\r\nmen, attacking in the river the disordered enemy, slew a great part of\r\nthem. By the immense number of their missiles they drove back the rest,\r\nwho in a most courageous manner were attempting to pass over their\r\nbodies, and surrounded with their cavalry, and cut to pieces those who\r\nhad first crossed the river. The enemy, when they perceived that their\r\nhopes had deceived them both with regard to their taking the town by\r\nstorm and also their passing the river, and did not see our men advance\r\nto a more disadvantageous place for the purpose of fighting, and when\r\nprovisions began to fail them, having called a council, determined that\r\nit was best for each to return to his country, and resolved to assemble\r\nfrom all quarters to defend those into whose territories the Romans\r\nshould first march an army; that they might contend in their own rather\r\nthan in a foreign country, and might enjoy the stores of provisions\r\nwhich they possessed at home. Together with other causes, this\r\nconsideration also led them to that resolution, viz.: that they had\r\nlearnt that Divitiacus and the Aedui were approaching the territories of\r\nthe Bellovaci. And it was impossible to persuade the latter to stay any\r\nlonger, or to deter them from conveying succour to their own people.\r\n\r\nXI.--That matter being determined on, marching out of their camp at the\r\nsecond watch, with great noise and confusion, in no fixed order, nor\r\nunder any command, since each sought for himself the foremost place in\r\nthe journey, and hastened to reach home, they made their departure\r\nappear very like a flight. Caesar, immediately learning this through his\r\nscouts, [but] fearing an ambuscade, because he had not yet discovered\r\nfor what reason they were departing, kept his army and cavalry within\r\nthe camp. At daybreak, the intelligence having been confirmed by the\r\nscouts, he sent forward his cavalry to harass their rear; and gave the\r\ncommand of it to two of his lieutenants, Q. Pedius, and L. Aurunculeius\r\nCotta. He ordered T. Labienus, another of his lieutenants, to follow\r\nthem closely with three legions. These, attacking their rear, and\r\npursuing them for many miles, slew a great number of them as they were\r\nfleeing; while those in the rear with whom they had come up, halted, and\r\nbravely sustained the attack of our soldiers; the van, because they\r\nappeared to be removed from danger, and were not restrained by any\r\nnecessity or command, as soon as the noise was heard, broke their ranks,\r\nand, to a man, rested their safety in flight. Thus without any risk [to\r\nthemselves] our men killed as great a number of them as the length of\r\nthe day allowed; and at sunset desisted from the pursuit, and betook\r\nthemselves into the camp, as they had been commanded.\r\n\r\nXII.--On the day following, before the enemy could recover from their\r\nterror and flight, Caesar led his army into the territories of the\r\nSuessiones, which are next to the Remi, and having accomplished a long\r\nmarch, hastens to the town named Noviodunum. Having attempted to take it\r\nby storm on his march, because he heard that it was destitute of\r\n[sufficient] defenders, he was not able to carry it by assault, on\r\naccount of the breadth of the ditch and the height of the wall, though\r\nfew were defending it. Therefore, having fortified the camp, he began to\r\nbring up the vineae, and to provide whatever things were necessary for\r\nthe storm. In the meantime, the whole body of the Suessiones, after\r\ntheir flight, came the next night into the town. The vineae having been\r\nquickly brought up against the town, a mound thrown up, and towers\r\nbuilt, the Gauls, amazed by the greatness of the works, such as they had\r\nneither seen nor heard of before, and struck, also, by the despatch of\r\nthe Romans, send ambassadors to Caesar respecting a surrender, and\r\nsucceed in consequence of the Remi requesting that they [the Suessiones]\r\nmight be spared.\r\n\r\nXIII.--Caesar, having received as hostages the first men of the state,\r\nand even the two sons of king Galba himself; and all the arms in the\r\ntown having been delivered up, admitted the Suessiones to a surrender,\r\nand led his army against the Bellovaci. Who, when they had conveyed\r\nthemselves and all their possessions into the town called Bratuspantium,\r\nand Caesar with his army was about five miles distant from that town,\r\nall the old men, going out of the town, began to stretch out their hands\r\nto Caesar, and to intimate by their voice that they would throw\r\nthemselves on his protection and power, nor would contend in arms\r\nagainst the Roman people. In like manner, when he had come up to the\r\ntown, and there pitched his camp, the boys and the women from the wall,\r\nwith outstretched hands, after their custom, begged peace from the\r\nRomans.\r\n\r\nXIV.--For these Divitiacus pleads (for after the departure of the\r\nBelgae, having dismissed the troops of the Aedui, he had returned to\r\nCaesar). \"The Bellovaci had at all times been in the alliance and\r\nfriendship of the Aeduan state; that they had revolted from the Aedui\r\nand made war upon the Roman people, being urged thereto by their nobles,\r\nwho said that the Aedui, reduced to slavery by Caesar, were suffering\r\nevery indignity and insult. That they who had been the leaders of that\r\nplot, because they perceived how great a calamity they had brought upon\r\nthe state, had fled into Britain. That not only the Bellovaci, but also\r\nthe Aedui, entreated him to use his [accustomed] clemency and lenity\r\ntowards them [the Bellovaci]: which if he did, he would increase the\r\ninfluence of the Aedui among all the Belgae, by whose succour and\r\nresources they had been accustomed to support themselves whenever any\r\nwars occurred.\"\r\n\r\nXV.--Caesar said that on account of his respect for Divitiacus and the\r\nAeduans, he would receive them into his protection, and would spare\r\nthem; but, because the state was of great influence among the Belgae,\r\nand pre-eminent in the number of its population, he demanded 600\r\nhostages. When these were delivered, and all the arms in the town\r\ncollected, he went from that place into the territories of the Ambiani,\r\nwho, without delay, surrendered themselves and all their possessions.\r\nUpon their territories bordered the Nervii, concerning whose character\r\nand customs when Caesar inquired he received the following information:\r\n--That \"there was no access for merchants to them; that they suffered no\r\nwine and other things tending to luxury to be imported; because they\r\nthought that by their use the mind is enervated and the courage\r\nimpaired: that they were a savage people and of great bravery: that they\r\nupbraided and condemned the rest of the Belgae who had surrendered\r\nthemselves to the Roman people and thrown aside their national courage:\r\nthat they openly declared they would neither send ambassadors, nor\r\naccept any condition of peace.\"\r\n\r\nXVI.--After he had made three days' march through their territories, he\r\ndiscovered from some prisoners, that the river Sambre was not more than\r\nten miles from his camp: that all the Nervii had stationed themselves on\r\nthe other side of that river, and together with the Atrebates and the\r\nVeromandui, their neighbours, were there awaiting the arrival of the\r\nRomans; for they had persuaded both these nations to try the same\r\nfortune of war [as themselves]: that the forces of the Aduatuci were\r\nalso expected by them, and were on their march; that they had put their\r\nwomen, and those who through age appeared useless for war, in a place to\r\nwhich there was no approach for an army, on account of the marshes.\r\n\r\nXVII.--Having learnt these things, he sends forward scouts and\r\ncenturions to choose a convenient place for the camp. And as a great\r\nmany of the surrounding Belgae and other Gauls, following Caesar,\r\nmarched with him; some of these, as was afterwards learnt from the\r\nprisoners, having accurately observed, during those days, the army's\r\nmethod of marching, went by night to the Nervii, and informed them that\r\na great number of baggage-trains passed between the several legions, and\r\nthat there would be no difficulty, when the first legion had come into\r\nthe camp, and the other legions were at a great distance, to attack that\r\nlegion while under baggage, which being routed, and the baggage-train\r\nseized, it would come to pass that the other legions would not dare to\r\nstand their ground. It added weight also to the advice of those who\r\nreported that circumstance, that the Nervii, from early times, because\r\nthey were weak in cavalry (for not even at this time do they attend to\r\nit, but accomplish by their infantry whatever they can), in order that\r\nthey might the more easily obstruct the cavalry of their neighbours if\r\nthey came upon them for the purpose of plundering, having cut young\r\ntrees, and bent them, by means of their numerous branches [extending] on\r\nto the sides, and the quick-briars and thorns springing up between them,\r\nhad made these hedges present a fortification like a wall, through which\r\nit was not only impossible to enter, but even to penetrate with the eye.\r\nSince [therefore] the march of our army would be obstructed by these\r\nthings, the Nervii thought that the advice ought not to be neglected by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nXVIII.--The nature of the ground which our men had chosen for the camp\r\nwas this: A hill, declining evenly from the top, extended to the river\r\nSambre, which we have mentioned above: from this river there arose a\r\n[second] hill of like ascent, on the other side and opposite to the\r\nformer, and open from about 200 paces at the lowest part; but in the\r\nupper part, woody, (so much so) that it was not easy to see through it\r\ninto the interior. Within those woods the enemy kept themselves in\r\nconcealment; a few troops of horse-soldiers appeared on the open ground,\r\nalong the river. The depth of the river was about three feet.\r\n\r\nXIX.--Caesar, having sent his cavalry on before, followed close after\r\nthem with all his forces; but the plan and order of the march was\r\ndifferent from that which the Belgae had reported to the Nervii. For as\r\nhe was approaching the enemy Caesar, according to his custom, led on [as\r\nthe van] six legions unencumbered by baggage; behind them he had placed\r\nthe baggage-trains of the whole army; then the two legions which had\r\nbeen last raised closed the rear, and were a guard for the baggage-train.\r\nOur horse, with the slingers and archers, having passed the river,\r\ncommenced action with the cavalry of the enemy. While they from\r\ntime to time betook themselves into the woods to their companions, and\r\nagain made an assault out of the wood upon our men, who did not dare to\r\nfollow them in their retreat further than the limit to which the plain\r\nand open parts extended, in the meantime the six legions which had\r\narrived first, having measured out the work, began to fortify the camp.\r\nWhen the first part of the baggage-train of our army was seen by those\r\nwho lay hid in the woods, which had been agreed on among them as the\r\ntime for commencing action, as soon as they had arranged their line of\r\nbattle and formed their ranks within the woods, and had encouraged one\r\nanother, they rushed out suddenly with all their forces and made an\r\nattack upon our horse. The latter being easily routed and thrown into\r\nconfusion, the Nervii ran down to the river with such incredible speed\r\nthat they seemed to be in the woods, the river, and close upon us almost\r\nat the same time. And with the same speed they hastened up the hill to\r\nour camp and to those who were employed in the works.\r\n\r\nXX.--Caesar had everything to do at one time: the standard to be\r\ndisplayed, which was the sign when it was necessary to run to arms; the\r\nsignal to be given by the trumpet; the soldiers to be called off from\r\nthe works; those who had proceeded some distance for the purpose of\r\nseeking materials for the rampart, to be summoned; the order of battle\r\nto be formed; the soldiers to be encouraged; the watchword to be given.\r\nA great part of these arrangements was prevented by the shortness of\r\ntime and the sudden approach and charge of the enemy. Under these\r\ndifficulties two things proved of advantage; [first] the skill and\r\nexperience of the soldiers, because, having been trained by former\r\nengagements, they could suggest to themselves what ought to be done, as\r\nconveniently as receive information from others; and [secondly] that\r\nCaesar had forbidden his several lieutenants to depart from the works\r\nand their respective legions, before the camp was fortified. These, on\r\naccount of the near approach and the speed of the enemy, did not then\r\nwait for any command from Caesar, but of themselves executed whatever\r\nappeared proper.\r\n\r\nXXI.--Caesar, having given the necessary orders, hastened to and fro\r\ninto whatever quarter fortune carried him to animate the troops, and\r\ncame to the tenth legion. Having encouraged the soldiers with no further\r\nspeech than that \"they should keep up the remembrance of their wonted\r\nvalour, and not be confused in mind, but valiantly sustain the assault\r\nof the enemy\"; as the latter were not farther from them than the\r\ndistance to which a dart could be cast, he gave the signal for\r\ncommencing battle. And having gone to another quarter for the purpose of\r\nencouraging [the soldiers], he finds them fighting. Such was the\r\nshortness of the time, and so determined was the mind of the enemy on\r\nfighting, that time was wanting not only for affixing the military\r\ninsignia, but even for putting on the helmets and drawing off the covers\r\nfrom the shields. To whatever part any one by chance came from the works\r\n(in which he had been employed), and whatever standards he saw first, at\r\nthese he stood, lest in seeking his own company he should lose the time\r\nfor fighting.\r\n\r\nXXII.--The army having been marshalled, rather as the nature of the\r\nground and the declivity of the hill and the exigency of the time, than\r\nas the method and order of military matters required; whilst the legions\r\nin the different places were withstanding the enemy, some in one\r\nquarter, some in another, and the view was obstructed by the very thick\r\nhedges intervening, as we have before remarked, neither could proper\r\nreserves be posted, nor could the necessary measures be taken in each\r\npart, nor could all the commands be issued by one person. Therefore, in\r\nsuch an unfavourable state of affairs, various events of fortune\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nXXIII.--The soldiers of the ninth and tenth legions, as they had been\r\nstationed on the left part of the army, casting their weapons, speedily\r\ndrove the Atrebates (for that division had been opposed to them), who\r\nwere breathless with running and fatigue, and worn out with wounds, from\r\nthe higher ground into the river; and following them as they were\r\nendeavouring to pass it, slew with their swords a great part of them\r\nwhile impeded (therein). They themselves did not hesitate to pass the\r\nriver; and having advanced to a disadvantageous place, when the battle\r\nwas renewed, they [nevertheless] again put to flight the enemy, who had\r\nreturned and were opposing them. In like manner, in another quarter two\r\ndifferent legions, the eleventh and the eighth, having routed the\r\nVeromandui, with whom they had engaged, were fighting from the higher\r\nground upon the very banks of the river. But, almost the whole camp on\r\nthe front and on the left side being then exposed, since the twelfth\r\nlegion was posted in the right wing, and the seventh at no great\r\ndistance from it, all the Nervii, in a very close body, with\r\nBoduognatus, who held the chief command, as their leader, hastened\r\ntowards that place; and part of them began to surround the legions on\r\ntheir unprotected flank, part to make for the highest point of the\r\nencampment.\r\n\r\nXXIV.--At the same time our horsemen, and light-armed infantry, who had\r\nbeen with those who, as I have related, were routed by the first assault\r\nof the enemy, as they were betaking themselves into the camp, met the\r\nenemy face to face, and again sought flight into another quarter; and\r\nthe camp-followers who from the Decuman Gate and from the highest ridge\r\nof the hill had seen our men pass the river as victors, when, after\r\ngoing out for the purposes of plundering, they looked back and saw the\r\nenemy parading in our camp, committed themselves precipitately to\r\nflight; at the same time there arose the cry and shout of those who came\r\nwith the baggage-train; and they (affrighted) were carried some one way,\r\nsome another. By all these circumstances the cavalry of the Treviri were\r\nmuch alarmed (whose reputation for courage is extraordinary among the\r\nGauls, and who had come to Caesar, being sent by their state as\r\nauxiliaries), and, when they saw our camp filled with a large number of\r\nthe enemy, the legions hard pressed and almost held surrounded, the\r\ncamp-retainers, horsemen, slingers, and Numidians fleeing on all sides\r\ndivided and scattered, they, despairing of our affairs, hastened home,\r\nand related to their state that the Romans were routed and conquered,\r\n[and] that the enemy were in possession of their camp and baggage-train.\r\n\r\nXXV.--Caesar proceeded, after encouraging the tenth legion, to the right\r\nwing; where he perceived that his men were hard pressed, and that in\r\nconsequence of the standards of the twelfth legion being collected\r\ntogether in one place, the crowded soldiers were a hindrance to\r\nthemselves in the fight; that all the centurions of the fourth cohort\r\nwere slain, and the standard-bearer killed, the standard itself lost,\r\nalmost all the centurions of the other cohorts either wounded or slain,\r\nand among them the chief centurion of the legion, P. Sextius Baculus, a\r\nvery valiant man, who was so exhausted by many and severe wounds, that\r\nhe was already unable to support himself; he likewise perceived that the\r\nrest were slackening their efforts, and that some, deserted by those in\r\nthe rear, were retiring from the battle and avoiding the weapons; that\r\nthe enemy [on the other hand], though advancing from the lower ground,\r\nwere not relaxing in front, and were [at the same time] pressing hard on\r\nboth flanks; he also perceived that the affair was at a crisis, and that\r\nthere was not any reserve which could be brought up; having therefore\r\nsnatched a shield from one of the soldiers in the rear (for he himself\r\nhad come without a shield), he advanced to the front of the line, and\r\naddressing the centurions by name, and encouraging the rest of the\r\nsoldiers, he ordered them to carry forward the standards, and extend the\r\ncompanies, that they might the more easily use their swords. On his\r\narrival, as hope was brought to the soldiers and their courage restored,\r\nwhilst every one for his own part, in the sight of his general, desired\r\nto exert his utmost energy, the impetuosity of the enemy was a little\r\nchecked.\r\n\r\nXXVI.--Caesar, when he perceived that the seventh legion, which stood\r\nclose by him, was also hard pressed by the enemy, directed the tribunes\r\nof the soldiers to effect a junction of the legions gradually, and make\r\ntheir charge upon the enemy with a double front; which having been done,\r\nsince they brought assistance the one to the other, nor feared lest\r\ntheir rear should be surrounded by the enemy, they began to stand their\r\nground more boldly, and to fight more courageously. In the meantime, the\r\nsoldiers of the two legions which had been in the rear of the army, as a\r\nguard for the baggage-train, upon the battle being reported to them,\r\nquickened their pace, and were seen by the enemy on the top of the hill;\r\nand Titus Labienus, having gained possession of the camp of the enemy,\r\nand observed from the higher ground what was going on in our camp, sent\r\nthe tenth legion as a relief to our men, who, when they had learnt from\r\nthe flight of the horse and the sutlers in what position the affair was,\r\nand in how great danger the camp and the legion and the commander were\r\ninvolved, left undone nothing [which tended] to despatch.\r\n\r\nXXVI.--By their arrival, so great a change of matters was made, that our\r\nmen, even those who had fallen down exhausted with wounds, leant on\r\ntheir shields, and renewed the fight: then the camp-retainers, though\r\nunarmed, seeing the enemy completely dismayed, attacked [them though]\r\narmed; the horsemen too, that they might by their valour blot out the\r\ndisgrace of their flight, thrust themselves before the legionary\r\nsoldiers in all parts of the battle. But the enemy, even in the last\r\nhope of safety, displayed such great courage that when the foremost of\r\nthem had fallen, the next stood upon them prostrate, and fought from\r\ntheir bodies; when these were overthrown, and their corpses heaped up\r\ntogether, those who survived cast their weapons against our men\r\n[thence], as from a mound, and returned our darts which had fallen\r\nbetween [the armies]; so that it ought not to be concluded, that men of\r\nsuch great courage had injudiciously dared to pass a very broad river,\r\nascend very high banks, and come up to a very disadvantageous place;\r\nsince their greatness of spirit had rendered these actions easy,\r\nalthough in themselves very difficult.\r\n\r\nXXVIII.--This battle being ended, and the nation and name of the Nervii\r\nbeing almost reduced to annihilation, their old men, whom together with\r\nthe boys and women we have stated to have been collected together in the\r\nfenny places and marshes, on this battle having been reported to them,\r\nsince they were convinced that nothing was an obstacle to the\r\nconquerors, and nothing safe to the conquered, sent ambassadors to\r\nCaesar by the consent of all who remained, and surrendered themselves to\r\nhim; and in recounting the calamity of their state, said that their\r\nsenators were reduced from 600 to three; that from 60,000 men they [were\r\nreduced] to scarcely 500 who could bear arms; whom Caesar, that he might\r\nappear to use compassion towards the wretched and the suppliant, most\r\ncarefully spared; and ordered them to enjoy their own territories and\r\ntowns, and commanded their neighbours that they should restrain\r\nthemselves and their dependants from offering injury or outrage [to\r\nthem].\r\n\r\nXXIX.--When the Aduatuci, of whom we have written above, were coming\r\nwith all their forces to the assistance of the Nervii, upon this battle\r\nbeing reported to them, they returned home after they were on the march;\r\ndeserting all their towns and forts, they conveyed together all their\r\npossessions into one town, eminently fortified by nature. While this\r\ntown had on all sides around it very high rocks and precipices, there\r\nwas left on one side a gently ascending approach, of not more than 200\r\nfeet in width; which place they had fortified with a very lofty double\r\nwall: besides, they had placed stones of great weight and sharpened\r\nstakes upon the walls. They were descended from the Cimbri and Teutones,\r\nwho, when they were marching into our province and Italy, having\r\ndeposited on this side the river Rhine such of their baggage-trains as\r\nthey could not drive or convey with them, left 6000 of their men as a\r\nguard and defence for them. These having, after the destruction of their\r\ncountrymen, been harassed for many years by their neighbours, while one\r\ntime they waged war offensively, and at another resisted it when waged\r\nagainst them, concluded a peace with the consent of all, and chose this\r\nplace as their settlement.\r\n\r\nXXX.--And on the first arrival of our army they made frequent sallies\r\nfrom the town, and contended with our men in trifling skirmishes:\r\nafterwards, when hemmed in by a rampart of twelve feet [in height], and\r\nfifteen miles in circuit, they kept themselves within the town. When,\r\nvineae having been brought up and a mound raised, they observed that a\r\ntower also was being built at a distance, they at first began to mock\r\nthe Romans from their wall, and to taunt them with the following\r\nspeeches. \"For what purpose was so vast a machine constructed at so\r\ngreat a distance?\" \"With what hands,\" or \"with what strength did they,\r\nespecially [as they were] men of such very small stature\" (for our\r\nshortness of stature, in comparison with the great size of their bodies,\r\nis generally a subject of much contempt to the men of Gaul), \"trust to\r\nplace against their walls a tower of such great weight.\"\r\n\r\nXXXI.--But when they saw that it was being moved, and was approaching\r\ntheir walls, startled by the new and unaccustomed sight, they sent\r\nambassadors to Caesar [to treat] about peace; who spoke in the following\r\nmanner: \"That they did not believe the Romans waged war without divine\r\naid, since they were able to move forward machines of such a height with\r\nso great speed, and thus fight from close quarters: that they resigned\r\nthemselves and all their possessions to [Caesar's] disposal: that they\r\nbegged and earnestly entreated one thing, viz., that if perchance,\r\nagreeably to his clemency and humanity, which they had heard of from\r\nothers, he should resolve that the Aduatuci were to be spared, he would\r\nnot deprive them of their arms; that all their neighbours were enemies\r\nto them and envied their courage, from whom they could not defend\r\nthemselves if their arms were delivered up: that it was better for them,\r\nif they should be reduced to that state, to suffer any fate from the\r\nRoman people, than to be tortured to death by those among whom they had\r\nbeen accustomed to rule.\"\r\n\r\nXXXII.--To these things Caesar replied, \"That he, in accordance with his\r\ncustom, rather than owing to their desert, should spare the state, if\r\nthey should surrender themselves before the battering-ram should touch\r\nthe wall; but that there was no condition of surrender, except upon\r\ntheir arms being delivered up; that he should do to them that which he\r\nhad done in the case of the Nervii, and would command their neighbours\r\nnot to offer any injury to those who had surrendered to the Roman\r\npeople.\" The matter being reported to their countrymen, they said that\r\nthey would execute his commands. Having cast a very large quantity of\r\ntheir arms from the wall into the trench which was before the town, so\r\nthat the heaps of arms almost equalled the top of the wall and the\r\nrampart, and nevertheless having retained and concealed, as we\r\nafterwards discovered, about a third part in the town, the gates were\r\nopened, and they enjoyed peace for that day.\r\n\r\nXXXIII.--Towards evening Caesar ordered the gates to be shut, and the\r\nsoldiers to go out of the town, lest the townspeople should receive any\r\ninjury from them by night. They [the Aduatuci], by a design before\r\nentered into, as we afterwards understood, because they believed that,\r\nas a surrender had been made, our men would dismiss their guards, or at\r\nleast would keep watch less carefully, partly with those arms which they\r\nhad retained and concealed, partly with shields made of bark or\r\ninterwoven wickers, which they had hastily covered over with skins (as\r\nthe shortness of time required) in the third watch, suddenly made a\r\nsally from the town with all their forces [in that direction] in which\r\nthe ascent to our fortifications seemed the least difficult. The signal\r\nhaving been immediately given by fires, as Caesar had previously\r\ncommanded, a rush was made thither [_i.e._ by the Roman soldiers] from\r\nthe nearest fort; and the battle was fought by the enemy as vigorously\r\nas it ought to be fought by brave men, in the last hope of safety, in a\r\ndisadvantageous place, and against those who were throwing their weapons\r\nfrom a rampart and from towers; since all hope of safety depended on\r\ntheir courage alone. About 4000 of the men having been slain, the rest\r\nwere forced back into the town. The day after, Caesar, after breaking\r\nopen the gates, which there was no one then to defend, and sending in\r\nour soldiers, sold the whole spoil of that town. The number of 53,000\r\npersons was reported to him by those who had bought them.\r\n\r\nXXXIV.--At the same time he was informed by P. Crassus, whom he had sent\r\nwith one legion against the Veneti, the Unelli, the Osismii, the\r\nCuriosolitae, the Sesuvii, the Aulerci, and the Rhedones, which are\r\nmaritime states, and touch upon the [Atlantic] ocean, that all these\r\nnations were brought under the dominion and power of the Roman people.\r\n\r\nXXXV.--These things being achieved, [and] all Gaul being subdued, so\r\nhigh an opinion of this war was spread among the barbarians, that\r\nambassadors were sent to Caesar by those nations who dwelt beyond the\r\nRhine, to promise that they would give hostages and execute his\r\ncommands. Which embassies Caesar, because he was hastening into Italy\r\nand Illyricum, ordered to return to him at the beginning of the\r\nfollowing summer. He himself, having led his legions into winter-quarters\r\namong the Carnutes, the Andes, and the Turones, which states\r\nwere close to those regions in which he had waged war, set out for\r\nItaly; and a thanksgiving of fifteen days was decreed for those\r\nachievements, upon receiving Caesar's letter; [an honour] which before\r\nthat time had been conferred on none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\nI.--When Caesar was setting out for Italy, he sent Servius Galba with\r\nthe twelfth legion and part of the cavalry against the Nantuates, the\r\nVeragri, and Seduni, who extend from the territories of the Allobroges,\r\nand the lake of Geneva, and the river Rhone to the top of the Alps. The\r\nreason for sending him was, that he desired that the pass along the\r\nAlps, through which [the Roman] merchants had been accustomed to travel\r\nwith great danger, and under great imposts, should be opened. He\r\npermitted him, if he thought it necessary, to station the legion in\r\nthese places, for the purpose of wintering. Galba having fought some\r\nsuccessful battles, and stormed several of their forts, upon ambassadors\r\nbeing sent to him from all parts and hostages given and a peace\r\nconcluded, determined to station two cohorts among the Nantuates, and to\r\nwinter in person with the other cohorts of that legion in a village of\r\nthe Veragri, which is called Octodurus; and this village being situated\r\nin a valley, with a small plain annexed to it, is bounded on all sides\r\nby very high mountains. As this village was divided into two parts by a\r\nriver, he granted one part of it to the Gauls, and assigned the other,\r\nwhich had been left by them unoccupied, to the cohorts to winter in. He\r\nfortified this [latter] part with a rampart and a ditch.\r\n\r\nII.--When several days had elapsed in winter quarters, and he had\r\nordered corn to be brought in, he was suddenly informed by his scouts\r\nthat all the people had gone off in the night from that part of the town\r\nwhich he had given up to the Gauls, and that the mountains which hung\r\nover it were occupied by a very large force of the Sedani and Veragri.\r\nIt had happened for several reasons that the Gauls suddenly formed the\r\ndesign of renewing the war and cutting off that legion. First, because\r\nthey despised a single legion, on account of its small number, and that\r\nnot quite full (two cohorts having been detached, and several\r\nindividuals being absent, who had been despatched for the purpose of\r\nseeking provision); then, likewise, because they thought that on account\r\nof the disadvantageous character of the situation, even their first\r\nattack could not be sustained [by us] when they would rush from the\r\nmountains into the valley, and discharge their weapons upon us. To this\r\nwas added, that they were indignant that their children were torn from\r\nthem under the title of hostages, and they were persuaded that the\r\nRomans designed to seize upon the summits of the Alps, and unite those\r\nparts to the neighbouring province [of Gaul], not only to secure the\r\npasses, but also as a constant possession.\r\n\r\nIII.--Having received these tidings, Galba, since the works of the\r\nwinter quarters and the fortifications were not fully completed, nor was\r\nsufficient preparation made with regard to corn and other provisions\r\n(since, as a surrender had been made, and hostages received, he had\r\nthought he need entertain no apprehension of a war), speedily summoning\r\na council, began to anxiously inquire their opinions. In which council,\r\nsince so much sudden danger had happened contrary to the general\r\nexpectation, and almost all the higher places were seen already covered\r\nwith a multitude of armed men, nor could [either] troops come to their\r\nrelief, or provisions be brought in, as the passes were blocked up [by\r\nthe enemy]; safety being now nearly despaired of, some opinions of this\r\nsort were delivered; that, \"leaving their baggage, and making a sally,\r\nthey should hasten away for safety by the same routes by which they had\r\ncome thither.\" To the greater part, however, it seemed best, reserving\r\nthat measure to the last, to await the issue of the matter, and to\r\ndefend the camp.\r\n\r\nIV.--A short time only having elapsed, so that time was scarcely given\r\nfor arranging and executing those things which they had determined on,\r\nthe enemy, upon the signal being given, rushed down [upon our men] from\r\nall parts, and discharged stones and darts upon our rampart. Our men at\r\nfirst, while their strength was fresh, resisted bravely, nor did they\r\ncast any weapon ineffectually from their higher station. As soon as any\r\npart of the camp, being destitute of defenders, seemed to be hard\r\npressed, thither they ran, and brought assistance. But they were\r\nover-matched in this, that the enemy when wearied by the long continuance\r\nof the battle, went out of the action, and others with fresh strength\r\ncame in their place; none of which things could be done by our men, owing\r\nto the smallness of their number; and not only was permission not given\r\nto the wearied [Roman] to retire from the fight, but not even to the\r\nwounded [was liberty granted] to quit the post where he had been\r\nstationed, and recover.\r\n\r\nV.--When they had now been fighting for more than six hours, without\r\ncessation, and not only strength, but even weapons were failing our men,\r\nand the enemy were pressing on more rigorously, and had begun to\r\ndemolish the rampart and to fill up the trench, while our men were\r\nbecoming exhausted, and the matter was now brought to the last\r\nextremity, P. Sextius Baculus, a centurion of the first rank, whom we\r\nhave related to have been disabled by severe wounds in the engagement\r\nwith the Nervii, and also C. Volusenus, a tribune of the soldiers, a man\r\nof great skill and valour, hasten to Galba, and assure him that the only\r\nhope of safety lay in making a sally, and trying the last resource.\r\nWhereupon, assembling the centurions, he quickly gives orders to the\r\nsoldiers to discontinue the fight a short time, and only collect the\r\nweapons flung [at them], and recruit themselves after their fatigue, and\r\nafterwards, upon the signal being given, sally forth from the camp, and\r\nplace in their valour all their hope of safety.\r\n\r\nVI.--They do what they were ordered; and, making a sudden sally from all\r\nthe gates [of the camp], leave the enemy the means neither of knowing\r\nwhat was taking place, nor of collecting themselves. Fortune thus taking\r\na turn, [our men] surround on every side, and slay those who had\r\nentertained the hope of gaining the camp, and having killed more than\r\nthe third part of an army of more than 30,000 men (which number of the\r\nbarbarians it appeared certain had come up to our camp), put to flight\r\nthe rest when panic-stricken, and do not suffer them to halt even upon\r\nthe higher grounds. All the forces of the enemy being thus routed, and\r\nstripped of their arms, [our men] betake themselves to their camp and\r\nfortifications. Which battle being finished, inasmuch as Galba was\r\nunwilling to tempt fortune again, and remembered that he had come into\r\nwinter quarters with one design, and saw that he had met with a\r\ndifferent state of affairs; chiefly however urged by the want of corn\r\nand provision, having the next day burned all the buildings of that\r\nvillage, he hastens to return into the province; and as no enemy opposed\r\nor hindered his march, he brought the legion safe into the [country of\r\nthe] Nantuates, thence into [that of] the Allobroges, and there\r\nwintered.\r\n\r\nVII.--These things being achieved, while Caesar had every reason to\r\nsuppose that Gaul was reduced to a state of tranquillity, the Belgae\r\nbeing overcome, the Germans expelled, the Seduni among the Alps\r\ndefeated, and when he had, therefore, in the beginning of winter, set\r\nout for Illyricum, as he wished to visit those nations, and acquire a\r\nknowledge of their countries, a sudden war sprang up in Gaul. The\r\noccasion of that war was this: P. Crassus, a young man, had taken up his\r\nwinter quarters with the seventh legion among the Andes, who border upon\r\nthe [Atlantic] ocean. He, as there was a scarcity of corn in those\r\nparts, sent out some officers of cavalry and several military tribunes\r\namongst the neighbouring states, for the purpose of procuring corn and\r\nprovision; in which number T. Terrasidius was sent amongst the Esubii;\r\nM. Trebius Gallus amongst the Curiosolitae; Q. Velanius, with T. Silius,\r\namongst the Veneti.\r\n\r\nVIII.--The influence of this state is by far the most considerable of\r\nany of the countries on the whole sea coast, because the Veneti both\r\nhave a very great number of ships, with which they have been accustomed\r\nto sail to Britain, and [thus] excel the rest in their knowledge and\r\nexperience of nautical affairs; and as only a few ports lie scattered\r\nalong that stormy and open sea, of which they are in possession, they\r\nhold as tributaries almost all those who are accustomed to traffic in\r\nthat sea. With them arose the beginning [of the revolt] by their\r\ndetaining Silius and Velanius; for they thought that they should recover\r\nby their means the hostages which they had given to Crassus. The\r\nneighbouring people, led on by their influence (as the measures of the\r\nGauls are sudden and hasty), detain Trebius and Terrasidius for the same\r\nmotive; and quickly sending ambassadors, by means of their leading men,\r\nthey enter into a mutual compact to do nothing except by general\r\nconsent, and abide the same issue of fortune; and they solicit the other\r\nstates to choose rather to continue in that liberty which they had\r\nreceived from their ancestors, than endure slavery under the Romans. All\r\nthe sea coast being quickly brought over to their sentiments, they send\r\na common embassy to P. Crassus [to say], \"If he wished to receive back\r\nhis officers, let him send back to them their hostages.\"\r\n\r\nIX.--Caesar, being informed of these things by Crassus, since he was so\r\nfar distant himself, orders ships of war to be built in the meantime on\r\nthe river Loire, which flows into the ocean; rowers to be raised from\r\nthe province; sailors and pilots to be provided. These matters being\r\nquickly executed, he himself, as soon as the season of the year permits,\r\nhastens to the army. The Veneti, and the other states also, being\r\ninformed of Caesar's arrival, when they reflected how great a crime they\r\nhad committed, in that the ambassadors (a character which had amongst\r\nall nations ever been sacred and inviolable) had by them been detained\r\nand thrown into prison, resolve to prepare for a war in proportion to\r\nthe greatness of their danger, and especially to provide those things\r\nwhich appertain to the service of a navy; with the greater confidence,\r\ninasmuch as they greatly relied on the nature of their situation. They\r\nknew that the passes by land were cut off by estuaries, that the\r\napproach by sea was most difficult, by reason of our ignorance of the\r\nlocalities, [and] the small number of the harbours, and they trusted\r\nthat our army would not be able to stay very long among them, on account\r\nof the insufficiency of corn; and again, even if all these things should\r\nturn out contrary to their expectation, yet they were very powerful in\r\ntheir navy. They, well understood that the Romans neither had any number\r\nof ships, nor were acquainted with the shallows, the harbours, or the\r\nislands of those parts where they would have to carry on the war; and\r\nthat navigation was very different in a narrow sea from what it was in\r\nthe vast and open ocean. Having come to this resolution, they fortify\r\ntheir towns, convey corn into them from the country parts, bring\r\ntogether as many ships as possible to Venetia, where it appeared Caesar\r\nwould at first carry on the war. They unite to themselves as allies for\r\nthat war, the Osismii, the Lexovii, the Nannetes, the Ambiliati, the\r\nMorini, the Diablintes, and the Menapii; and send for auxiliaries from\r\nBritain, which is situated over against those regions.\r\n\r\nX.--There were these difficulties which we have mentioned above, in\r\ncarrying on the war, but many things, nevertheless, urged Caesar to that\r\nwar; the open insult offered to the state in the detention of the Roman\r\nknights, the rebellion raised after surrendering, the revolt after\r\nhostages were given, the confederacy of so many states, but principally,\r\nlest if [the conduct of] this part was overlooked, the other nations\r\nshould think that the same thing was permitted them. Wherefore, since he\r\nreflected that almost all the Gauls were fond of revolution, and easily\r\nand quickly excited to war; that all men likewise, by nature, love\r\nliberty and hate the condition of slavery, he thought he ought to divide\r\nand more widely distribute his army, before more states should join the\r\nconfederation.\r\n\r\nXI.--He therefore sends T. Labienus, his lieutenant, with the cavalry to\r\nthe Treviri, who are nearest to the river Rhine. He charges him to visit\r\nthe Remi and the other Belgians, and to keep them in their allegiance\r\nand repel the Germans (who were said to have been summoned by the Belgae\r\nto their aid) if they attempted to cross the river by force in their\r\nships. He orders P. Crassus to proceed into Aquitania with twelve\r\nlegionary cohorts and a great number of the cavalry, lest auxiliaries\r\nshould be sent into Gaul by these states, and such great nations be\r\nunited. He sends Q. Titurius Sabinus, his lieutenant, with three\r\nlegions, among the Unelli, the Curiosolitae, and the Lexovii, to take\r\ncare that their forces should be kept separate from the rest. He\r\nappoints D. Brutus, a young man, over the fleet and those Gallic vessels\r\nwhich he had ordered to be furnished by the Pictones and the Santoni,\r\nand the other provinces which remained at peace; and commands him to\r\nproceed towards the Veneti, as soon as he could. He himself hastens\r\nthither with the land forces.\r\n\r\nXII.--The sites of their towns were generally such that, being placed on\r\nextreme points [of land] and on promontories, they neither had an\r\napproach by land when the tide had rushed in from the main ocean, which\r\nalways happens twice in the space of twelve hours; nor by ships,\r\nbecause, upon the tide ebbing again, the ships were likely to be dashed\r\nupon the shoals. Thus, by either circumstance, was the storming of their\r\ntowns rendered difficult; and if at any time perchance the Veneti,\r\noverpowered by the greatness of our works (the sea having been excluded\r\nby a mound and large dams, and the latter being made almost equal in\r\nheight to the walls of the town), had begun to despair of their\r\nfortunes, bringing up a large number of ships, of which they had a very\r\ngreat quantity, they carried off all their property and betook\r\nthemselves to the nearest towns; there they again defended themselves by\r\nthe same advantages of situation. They did this the more easily during a\r\ngreat part of the summer, because our ships were kept back by storms,\r\nand the difficulty of sailing was very great in that vast and open sea,\r\nwith its strong tides and its harbours far apart and exceedingly few in\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nXIII.--For their ships were built and equipped after this manner. The\r\nkeels were somewhat flatter than those of our ships, whereby they could\r\nmore easily encounter the shallows and the ebbing of the tide: the prows\r\nwere raised very high, and in like manner the sterns were adapted to the\r\nforce of the waves and storms [which they were formed to sustain]. The\r\nships were built wholly of oak, and designed to endure any force and\r\nviolence whatever; the benches, which were made of planks a foot in\r\nbreadth, were fastened by iron spikes of the thickness of a man's thumb;\r\nthe anchors were secured fast by iron chains instead of cables, and for\r\nsails they used skins and thin dressed leather. These [were used] either\r\nthrough their want of canvas and their ignorance of its application, or\r\nfor this reason, which is more probable, that they thought that such\r\nstorms of the ocean, and such violent gales of wind could not be\r\nresisted by sails, nor ships of such great burden be conveniently enough\r\nmanaged by them. The encounter of our fleet with these ships was of such\r\na nature that our fleet excelled in speed alone, and the plying of the\r\noars; other things, considering the nature of the place [and] the\r\nviolence of the storms, were more suitable and better adapted on their\r\nside; for neither could our ships injure theirs with their beaks (so\r\ngreat was their strength), nor on account of their height was a weapon\r\neasily cast up to them; and for the same reason they were less readily\r\nlocked in by rocks. To this was added, that whenever a storm began to\r\nrage and they ran before the wind, they both could weather the storm\r\nmore easily and heave to securely in the shallows, and when left by the\r\ntide feared nothing from rocks and shelves: the risk of all which things\r\nwas much to be dreaded by our ships.\r\n\r\nXIV.--Caesar, after taking many of their towns, perceiving that so much\r\nlabour was spent in vain and that the flight of the enemy could not be\r\nprevented on the capture of their towns, and that injury could not be\r\ndone them, he determined to wait for his fleet. As soon as it came up\r\nand was first seen by the enemy, about 220 of their ships, fully\r\nequipped and appointed with every kind of [naval] implement, sailed\r\nforth from the harbour, and drew up opposite to ours; nor did it appear\r\nclear to Brutus, who commanded the fleet, or to the tribunes of the\r\nsoldiers and the centurions, to whom the several ships were assigned,\r\nwhat to do, or what system of tactics to adopt; for they knew that\r\ndamage could not be done by their beaks; and that, although turrets were\r\nbuilt [on their decks], yet the height of the stems of the barbarian\r\nships exceeded these; so that weapons could not be cast up from [our]\r\nlower position with sufficient effect, and those cast by the Gauls fell\r\nthe more forcibly upon us. One thing provided by our men was of great\r\nservice, [viz.] sharp hooks inserted into and fastened upon poles, of a\r\nform not unlike the hooks used in attacking town walls. When the ropes\r\nwhich fastened the sail-yards to the masts were caught by them and\r\npulled, and our vessel vigorously impelled with the oars, they [the\r\nropes] were severed; and when they were cut away, the yards necessarily\r\nfell down; so that as all the hope of the Gallic vessels depended on\r\ntheir sails and rigging, upon these being cut away, the entire\r\nmanagement of the ships was taken from them at the same time. The rest\r\nof the contest depended on courage; in which our men decidedly had the\r\nadvantage; and the more so because the whole action was carried on in\r\nthe sight of Caesar and the entire army; so that no act, a little more\r\nvaliant than ordinary, could pass unobserved, for all the hills and\r\nhigher grounds, from which there was a near prospect of the sea, were\r\noccupied by our army.\r\n\r\nXV.--The sail-yards [of the enemy], as we have said, being brought down,\r\nalthough two and [in some cases] three ships [of theirs] surrounded each\r\none [of ours], the soldiers strove with the greatest energy to board the\r\nships of the enemy: and, after the barbarians observed this taking\r\nplace, as a great many of their ships were beaten, and as no relief for\r\nthat evil could be discovered, they hastened to seek safety in flight.\r\nAnd, having now turned their vessels to that quarter in which the wind\r\nblew, so great a calm and lull suddenly arose, that they could not move\r\nout of their place, which circumstance, truly, was exceedingly opportune\r\nfor finishing the business; for our men gave chase and took them one by\r\none, so that very few out of all the number, [and those] by the\r\nintervention of night, arrived at the land, after the battle had lasted\r\nalmost from the fourth hour till sunset.\r\n\r\nXVI.--By this battle the war with the Veneti and the whole of the sea\r\ncoast was finished; for both all the youth, and all, too, of more\r\nadvanced age, in whom there was any discretion or rank, had assembled in\r\nthat battle; and they had collected in that one place whatever naval\r\nforces they had anywhere; and when these were lost, the survivors had no\r\nplace to retreat to, nor means of defending their towns. They\r\naccordingly surrendered themselves and all their possessions to Caesar,\r\non whom Caesar thought that punishment should be inflicted the more\r\nseverely, in order that for the future the rights of ambassadors might\r\nbe more carefully respected, by barbarians: having, therefore, put to\r\ndeath all their senate, he sold the rest for slaves.\r\n\r\nXVII.--While these things are going on amongst the Veneti, Q. Titurius\r\nSabinus with those troops which he had received from Caesar, arrives in\r\nthe territories of the Unelli. Over these people Viridovix ruled, and\r\nheld the chief command of all those states which had revolted: from\r\nwhich he had collected a large and powerful army. And in those few days,\r\nthe Aulerci and the Sexovii, having slain their senate because they\r\nwould not consent to be promoters of the war, shut their gates [against\r\nus] and united themselves to Viridovix; a great multitude besides of\r\ndesperate men and robbers assembled out of Gaul from all quarters, whom\r\nthe hope of plundering and the love of fighting had called away from\r\nhusbandry and their daily labour. Sabinus kept himself within his camp,\r\nwhich was in a position convenient for everything; while Viridovix\r\nencamped over against him at a distance of two miles, and daily bringing\r\nout his forces, gave him an opportunity of fighting; so that Sabinus had\r\nnow not only come into contempt with the enemy, but also was somewhat\r\ntaunted by the speeches of our soldiers; and furnished so great a\r\nsuspicion of his cowardice that the enemy presumed to approach even to\r\nthe very rampart of our camp. He adopted this conduct for the following\r\nreason: because he did not think that a lieutenant ought to engage in\r\nbattle with so great a force, especially while he who held the chief\r\ncommand was absent, except on advantageous ground or some favourable\r\ncircumstance presented itself.\r\n\r\nXVIII.--After having established this suspicion of his cowardice, he\r\nselected a certain suitable and crafty Gaul, who was one of those whom\r\nhe had with him as auxiliaries. He induces him by great gifts and\r\npromises to go over to the enemy; and informs [him] of what he wished to\r\nbe done. Who, when he arrives amongst them as a deserter, lays before\r\nthem the fears of the Romans; and informs them by what difficulties\r\nCaesar himself was harassed, and that the matter was not far removed\r\nfrom this--that Sabinus would the next night privately draw off his army\r\nout of the camp and set forth to Caesar, for the purpose of carrying\r\n[him] assistance, which, when they heard, they all cry out together that\r\nan opportunity of successfully conducting their enterprise ought not to\r\nbe thrown away; that they ought to go to the [Roman] camp. Many things\r\npersuaded the Gauls to this measure; the delay of Sabinus during the\r\nprevious days; the positive assertion of the [pretended] deserter; want\r\nof provisions, for a supply of which they had not taken the requisite\r\nprecautions; the hope springing from the Venetic war; and [also] because\r\nin most cases men willingly believe what they wish. Influenced by these\r\nthings, they do not discharge Viridovix and the other leaders from the\r\ncouncil, before they gained permission from them to take up arms and\r\nhasten to [our] camp; which being granted, rejoicing as if victory were\r\nfully certain, they collected faggots and brushwood, with which to fill\r\nup the Roman trenches, and hasten to the camp.\r\n\r\nXIX.--The situation of the camp was a rising ground, gently sloping from\r\nthe bottom for about a mile. Thither they proceeded with great speed (in\r\norder that as little time as possible might be given to the Romans to\r\ncollect and arm themselves), and arrived quite out of breath. Sabinus\r\nhaving encouraged his men, gives them the signal, which they earnestly\r\ndesired. While the enemy were encumbered by reason of the burdens which\r\nthey were carrying, he orders a sally to be suddenly made from two gates\r\n[of the camp]. It happened, by the advantage of situation, by the\r\nunskilfulness and the fatigue of the enemy, by the valour of our\r\nsoldiers, and their experience in former battles, that they could not\r\nstand one attack of our men, and immediately turned their backs: and our\r\nmen with full vigour followed them while disordered, and slew a great\r\nnumber of them; the horse pursuing the rest, left but few, who escaped\r\nby flight. Thus at the same time, Sabinus was informed of the naval\r\nbattle and Caesar of victory gained by Sabinus; and all the states\r\nimmediately surrendered themselves to Titurius: for as the temper of the\r\nGauls is impetuous and ready to undertake wars, so their mind is weak,\r\nand by no means resolute in enduring calamities.\r\n\r\nXX.--About the same time, P. Crassus, when he had arrived in Aquitania\r\n(which, as has been before said, both from its extent of territory and\r\nthe great number of its people, is to be reckoned a third part of Gaul),\r\nunderstanding that he was to wage war in these parts, where a few years\r\nbefore L. Valerius Praeconinus, the lieutenant, had been killed, and his\r\narmy routed, and from which L. Manilius, the proconsul, had fled with\r\nthe loss of his baggage, he perceived that no ordinary care must be used\r\nby him. Wherefore, having provided corn, procured auxiliaries and\r\ncavalry, [and] having summoned by name many valiant men from Tolosa,\r\nCarcaso, and Narbo, which are the states of the province of Gaul, that\r\nborder on these regions [Aquitania], he led his army into the\r\nterritories of the Sotiates. On his arrival being known, the Sotiates\r\nhaving brought together great forces and [much] cavalry, in which their\r\nstrength principally lay, and assailing our army on the march, engaged\r\nfirst in a cavalry action, then when their cavalry was routed, and our\r\nmen pursuing, they suddenly display their infantry forces, which they\r\nhad placed in ambuscade in a valley. These attacked our men [while]\r\ndisordered, and renewed the fight.\r\n\r\nXXI.--The battle was long and vigorously contested, since the Sotiates,\r\nrelying on their former victories, imagined that the safety of the whole\r\nof Aquitania rested on their valour; [and] our men, on the other hand,\r\ndesired it might be seen what they could accomplish without their\r\ngeneral and without the other legions, under a very young commander; at\r\nlength the enemy, worn out with wounds, began to turn their backs, and a\r\ngreat number of them being slain, Crassus began to besiege the\r\n[principal] town of the Sotiates on his march. Upon their valiantly\r\nresisting, he raised vineae and turrets. They at one time attempting a\r\nsally, at another forming mines to our rampart and vineae (at which the\r\nAquitani are eminently skilled, because in many places amongst them\r\nthere are copper mines); when they perceived that nothing could be\r\ngained by these operations through the perseverance of our men, they\r\nsend ambassadors to Crassus, and entreat him to admit them to a\r\nsurrender. Having obtained it, they, being ordered to deliver up their\r\narms, comply.\r\n\r\nXXII.--And while the attention of our men is engaged in that matter, in\r\nanother part Adcantuannus, who held the chief command, with 600 devoted\r\nfollowers, whom they call soldurii (the conditions of whose association\r\nare these,--that they enjoy all the conveniences of life with those to\r\nwhose friendship they have devoted themselves: if anything calamitous\r\nhappen to them, either they endure the same destiny together with them,\r\nor commit suicide: nor hitherto, in the memory of men, has there been\r\nfound any one who, upon his being slain to whose friendship he had\r\ndevoted himself, refused to die); Adcantuannus, [I say] endeavouring to\r\nmake a sally with these, when our soldiers had rushed together to arms,\r\nupon a shout being raised at that part of the fortification, and a\r\nfierce battle had been fought there, was driven back into the town, yet\r\nhe obtained from Crassus [the indulgence] that he should enjoy the same\r\nterms of surrender [as the other inhabitants].\r\n\r\nXXIII.--Crassus, having received their arms and hostages, marched into\r\nthe territories of the Vocates and the Tarusates. But then, the\r\nbarbarians being alarmed, because they had heard that a town fortified\r\nby the nature of the place and by art had been taken by us in a few days\r\nafter our arrival there, began to send ambassadors into all quarters, to\r\ncombine, to give hostages one to another, to raise troops. Ambassadors\r\nalso are sent to those states of Hither Spain which are nearest to\r\nAquitania, and auxiliaries and leaders are summoned from them; on whose\r\narrival they proceed to carry on the war with great confidence, and with\r\na great host of men. They who had been with Q. Sertorius the whole\r\nperiod [of his war in Spain] and were supposed to have very great skill\r\nin military matters, are chosen leaders. These, adopting the practice of\r\nthe Roman people, begin to select [advantageous] places, to fortify\r\ntheir camp, to cut off our men from provisions, which, when Crassus\r\nobserves, [and likewise] that his forces, on account of their small\r\nnumber, could not safely be separated; that the enemy both made\r\nexcursions and beset the passes, and [yet] left sufficient guard for\r\ntheir camp; that on that account, corn and provision could not very\r\nconveniently be brought up to him, and that the number of the enemy was\r\ndaily increased, he thought that he ought not to delay in giving battle.\r\nThis matter being brought to a council, when he discovered that all\r\nthought the same thing, he appointed the next day for the fight.\r\n\r\nXXIV.--Having drawn out all his forces at the break of day, and\r\nmarshalled them in a double line, he posted the auxiliaries in the\r\ncentre, and waited to see what measures the enemy would take. They,\r\nalthough on account of their great number and their ancient renown in\r\nwar, and the small number of our men, they supposed they might safely\r\nfight, nevertheless considered it safer to gain the victory without any\r\nwound, by besetting the passes [and] cutting off the provisions: and if\r\nthe Romans, on account of the want of corn, should begin to retreat,\r\nthey intended to attack them while encumbered in their march and\r\ndepressed in spirit [as being assailed while] under baggage. This\r\nmeasure being approved of by the leaders and the forces of the Romans\r\ndrawn out, the enemy [still] kept themselves in their camp. Crassus\r\nhaving remarked this circumstance, since the enemy, intimidated by their\r\nown delay, and by the reputation [_i.e._ for cowardice arising thence]\r\nhad rendered our soldiers more eager for fighting, and the remarks of\r\nall were heard [declaring] that no longer ought delay to be made in\r\ngoing to the camp, after encouraging his men, he marches to the camp of\r\nthe enemy, to the great gratification of his own troops.\r\n\r\nXXV.--There, while some were filling up the ditch, and others, by\r\nthrowing a large number of darts, were driving the defenders from the\r\nrampart and fortifications, and the auxiliaries, on whom Crassus did not\r\nmuch rely in the battle, by supplying stones and weapons [to the\r\nsoldiers], and by conveying turf to the mound, presented the appearance\r\nand character of men engaged in fighting; while also the enemy were\r\nfighting resolutely and boldly, and their weapons, discharged from their\r\nhigher position, fell with great effect; the horse, having gone round\r\nthe camp of the enemy, reported to Crassus that the camp was not\r\nfortified with equal care on the side of the Decuman gate, and had an\r\neasy approach.\r\n\r\nXXVI.--Crassus, having exhorted the commanders of the horse to animate\r\ntheir men by great rewards and promises, points out to them what he\r\nwished to have done. They, as they had been commanded, having brought\r\nout the four cohorts, which, as they had been left as a guard for the\r\ncamp, were not fatigued by exertion, and having led them round by a\r\nsomewhat longer way, lest they could be seen from the camp of the enemy,\r\nwhen the eyes and minds of all were intent upon the battle, quickly\r\narrived at those fortifications which we have spoken of, and, having\r\ndemolished these, stood in the camp of the enemy before they were seen\r\nby them, or it was known what was going on. And then, a shout being\r\nheard in that quarter, our men, their strength having been recruited\r\n(which usually occurs on the hope of victory), began to fight more\r\nvigorously. The enemy, surrounded on all sides, [and] all their affairs\r\nbeing despaired of, made great attempts to cast themselves down over the\r\nramparts and to seek safety in flight. These the cavalry pursued over\r\nthe very open plains, and after leaving scarcely a fourth part out of\r\nthe number of 50,000, which it was certain had assembled out of\r\nAquitania and from the Cantabri, returned late at night to the camp.\r\n\r\nXXVII.--Having heard of this battle, the greatest part of Aquitania\r\nsurrendered itself to Crassus, and of its own accord sent hostages, in\r\nwhich number were the Tarbelli, the Bigerriones, the Preciani, the\r\nVocasates, the Tarusates, the Elurates, the Garites, the Ausci, the\r\nGarumni, the Sibuzates, the Cocosates. A few [and those] most remote\r\nnations, relying on the time of the year, because winter was at hand,\r\nneglected to do this.\r\n\r\nXXVIII.--About the same time Caesar, although the summer was nearly\r\npast, yet since, all Gaul being reduced, the Morini and the Menapii\r\nalone remained in arms, and had never sent ambassadors to him [to make a\r\ntreaty] of peace, speedily led his army thither, thinking that that war\r\nmight soon be terminated. They resolved to conduct the war on a very\r\ndifferent method from the rest of the Gauls; for as they perceived that\r\nthe greatest nations [of Gaul] who had engaged in war, had been routed\r\nand overcome, and as they possessed continuous ranges of forests and\r\nmorasses, they removed themselves and all their property thither. When\r\nCaesar had arrived at the opening of these forests, and had begun to\r\nfortify his camp, and no enemy was in the meantime seen, while our men\r\nwere dispersed on their respective duties, they suddenly rushed out from\r\nall parts of the forest, and made an attack on our men. The latter\r\nquickly took up arms and drove them back again to their forests; and\r\nhaving killed a great many, lost a few of their own men while pursuing\r\nthem too far through those intricate places.\r\n\r\nXXIX.--During the remaining days after this, Caesar began to cut down\r\nthe forests; and that no attack might be made on the flank of the\r\nsoldiers, while unarmed and not foreseeing it, he placed together\r\n(opposite to the enemy) all that timber which was cut down, and piled it\r\nup as a rampart on either flank. When a great space had been, with\r\nincredible speed, cleared in a few days, when the cattle [of the enemy]\r\nand the rear of their baggage-train were already seized by our men, and\r\nthey themselves were seeking for the thickest parts of the forests,\r\nstorms of such a kind came on that the work was necessarily suspended,\r\nand, through the continuance of the rains, the soldiers could not any\r\nlonger remain in their tents. Therefore, having laid waste all their\r\ncountry, [and] having burnt their villages and houses, Caesar led back\r\nhis army and stationed them in winter-quarters among the Aulerci and\r\nLexovii, and the other states which had made war upon him last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV\r\n\r\nI.-The following winter (this was the year in which Cn. Pompey and M.\r\nCrassus were consuls), those Germans [called] the Usipetes, and likewise\r\nthe Tenchtheri, with a great number of men, crossed the Rhine, not far\r\nfrom the place at which that river discharges itself into the sea. The\r\nmotive for crossing [that river] was that, having been for several years\r\nharassed by the Suevi, they were constantly engaged in war, and hindered\r\nfrom the pursuits of agriculture. The nation of the Suevi is by far the\r\nlargest and the most warlike nation of all the Germans. They are said to\r\npossess a hundred cantons, from each of which they yearly send from\r\ntheir territories for the purpose of war a thousand armed men: the\r\nothers who remain at home, maintain [both] themselves and those engaged\r\nin the expedition. The latter again, in their turn, are in arms the year\r\nafter: the former remain at home. Thus neither husbandry nor the art and\r\npractice of war are neglected. But among them there exists no private\r\nand separate land; nor are they permitted to remain more than one year\r\nin one place for the purpose of residence. They do not live much on\r\ncorn, but subsist for the most part on milk and flesh, and are much\r\n[engaged] in hunting; which circumstance must, by the nature of their\r\nfood, and by their daily exercise and the freedom of their life (for\r\nhaving from boyhood been accustomed to no employment, or discipline,\r\nthey do nothing at all contrary to their inclination), both promote\r\ntheir strength and render them men of vast stature of body. And to such\r\na habit have they brought themselves, that even in the coldest parts\r\nthey wear no clothing whatever except skins, by reason of the scantiness\r\nof which a great portion of their body is bare, and besides they bathe\r\nin open rivers.\r\n\r\nII.--Merchants have access to them rather that they may have persons to\r\nwhom they may sell those things which they have taken in war, than\r\nbecause they need any commodity to be imported to them. Moreover, even\r\nas to labouring cattle, in which the Gauls take the greatest pleasure,\r\nand which they procure at a great price, the Germans do not employ such\r\nas are imported, but those poor and ill-shaped animals which belong to\r\ntheir country; these, however, they render capable of the greatest\r\nlabour by daily exercise. In cavalry actions they frequently leap from\r\ntheir horses and fight on foot; and train their horses to stand still in\r\nthe very spot on which they leave them, to which they retreat with great\r\nactivity when there is occasion; nor, according to their practice, is\r\nanything regarded as more unseemly, or more unmanly, than to use\r\nhousings. Accordingly, they have the courage, though they be themselves\r\nbut few, to advance against any number whatever of horse mounted with\r\nhousings. They on no account permit wine to be imported to them, because\r\nthey consider that men degenerate in their powers of enduring fatigue,\r\nand are rendered effeminate by that commodity.\r\n\r\nIII.--They esteem it their greatest praise as a nation that the lands\r\nabout their territories lie unoccupied to a very great extent, inasmuch\r\nas [they think] that by this circumstance is indicated that a great\r\nnumber of nations cannot, withstand their power; and thus on one side of\r\nthe Suevi the lands are said to lie desolate for about six hundred\r\nmiles. On the other side they border on the Ubii, whose state was large\r\nand flourishing, considering the condition of the Germans, and who are\r\nsomewhat more refined than those of the same race and the rest [of the\r\nGermans], and that because they border on the Rhine, and are much\r\nresorted to by merchants, and are accustomed to the manners of the\r\nGauls, by reason of their approximity to them. Though the Suevi, after\r\nmaking the attempt frequently and in several wars, could not expel this\r\nnation from their territories, on account of the extent and population\r\nof their state, yet they made them tributaries, and rendered them less\r\ndistinguished and powerful [than they had ever been].\r\n\r\nIV.--In the same condition were the Usipetes and the Tenchtheri (whom we\r\nhave mentioned above), who for many years resisted the power of the\r\nSuevi, but being at last driven from their possessions, and having\r\nwandered through many parts of Germany, came to the Rhine, to districts\r\nwhich the Menapii inhabited, and where they had lands, houses, and\r\nvillages on either side of the river. The latter people, alarmed by the\r\narrival of so great a multitude, removed from those houses which they\r\nhad on the other side of the river, and having placed guards on this\r\nside the Rhine, proceeded to hinder the Germans from crossing. They,\r\nfinding themselves, after they had tried all means, unable either to\r\nforce a passage on account of their deficiency in shipping, or cross by\r\nstealth on account of the guards of the Menapii, pretended to return to\r\ntheir own settlements and districts; and, after having proceeded three\r\ndays' march, returned; and their cavalry having performed the whole of\r\nthis journey in one night, cut off the Menapii, who were ignorant of,\r\nand did not expect [their approach, and] who, having moreover been\r\ninformed of the departure of the Germans by their scouts, had without\r\napprehension returned to their villages beyond the Rhine. Having slain\r\nthese, and seized their ships, they crossed the river before that part\r\nof the Menapii, who were at peace in their settlements over the Rhine,\r\nwere apprised of [their intention]; and seizing all their houses,\r\nmaintained themselves upon their provisions during the rest of the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nV.--Caesar, when informed of these matters, fearing the fickle\r\ndisposition of the Gauls, who are easily prompted to take up\r\nresolutions, and much addicted to change, considered that nothing was to\r\nbe entrusted to them; for it is the custom of that people to compel\r\ntravellers to stop, even against their inclination, and inquire what\r\nthey may have heard, or may know, respecting any matter; and in towns\r\nthe common people throng around merchants and force them to state from\r\nwhat countries they come, and what affairs they know of there. They\r\noften engage in resolutions concerning the most important matters,\r\ninduced by these reports and stories alone; of which they must\r\nnecessarily instantly repent, since they yield to mere unauthorised\r\nreports; and since most people give to their questions answers framed\r\nagreeably to their wishes.\r\n\r\nVI.--Caesar, being aware of their custom, in order that he might not\r\nencounter a more formidable war, sets forward to the army earlier in the\r\nyear than he was accustomed to do. When he had arrived there, he\r\ndiscovered that those things, which he had suspected would occur, had\r\ntaken place; that embassies had been sent to the Germans by some of the\r\nstates, and that they had been entreated to leave the Rhine, and had\r\nbeen promised that all things which they desired should be provided by\r\nthe Gauls. Allured by this hope, the Germans were then making excursions\r\nto greater distances, and had advanced to the territories of the\r\nEburones and the Condrusi, who are under the protection of the Treviri.\r\nAfter summoning the chiefs of Gaul, Caesar thought proper to pretend\r\nignorance of the things which he had discovered; and having conciliated\r\nand confirmed their minds, and ordered some cavalry to be raised,\r\nresolved to make war against the Germans.\r\n\r\nVII.--Having provided corn and selected his cavalry, he began to direct\r\nhis march towards those parts in which he heard the Germans were. When\r\nhe was distant from them only a few days' march, ambassadors come to him\r\nfrom their state; whose speech was as follows:--\"That the Germans\r\nneither make war upon the Roman people first, nor do they decline, if\r\nthey are provoked, to engage with them in arms; for that this was the\r\ncustom of the Germans handed down to them from their forefathers, to\r\nresist whatsoever people make war upon them and not to avert it by\r\nentreaty; this, however, they confessed,--that they had come hither\r\nreluctantly, having been expelled from their country. If the Romans were\r\ndisposed to accept their friendship, they might be serviceable allies to\r\nthem; and let them either assign them lands, or permit them to retain\r\nthose which they had acquired by their arms; that they are inferior to\r\nthe Suevi alone, to whom not even the immortal gods can show themselves\r\nequal; that there was none at all besides on earth whom they could not\r\nconquer.\"\r\n\r\nVIII.--To these remarks Caesar replied in such terms as he thought\r\nproper; but the conclusion of his speech was, \"That he could make no\r\nalliance with them, if they continued in Gaul; that it was not probable\r\nthat they who were not able to defend their own territories, should get\r\npossession of those of others, nor were there any lands lying waste in\r\nGaul which could be given away, especially to so great a number of men,\r\nwithout doing wrong [to others]; but they might, if they were desirous,\r\nsettle in the territories of the Ubii; whose ambassadors were then with\r\nhim, and were complaining of the aggressions of the Suevi, and\r\nrequesting assistance from him; and that he would obtain this request\r\nfrom them.\"\r\n\r\nIX.--The ambassadors said that they would report these things to their\r\ncountrymen; and, after having deliberated on the matter, would return to\r\nCaesar after the third day, they begged that he would not in the\r\nmeantime advance his camp nearer to them. Caesar said that he could not\r\ngrant them even that; for he had learned that they had sent a great part\r\nof their cavalry over the Meuse to the Ambivariti, some days before, for\r\nthe purpose of plundering and procuring forage. He supposed that they\r\nwere then waiting for these horse, and that the delay was caused on this\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nX.--The Meuse rises from mount Le Vosge, which is in the territories of\r\nthe Lingones; and, having received a branch of the Rhine, which is\r\ncalled the Waal, forms the island of the Batavi, and not more than\r\neighty miles from it it falls into the ocean. But the Rhine takes its\r\ncourse among the Lepontii, who inhabit the Alps, and is carried with a\r\nrapid current for a long distance through the territories of the\r\nSarunates, Helvetii, Sequani, Mediomatrici, Tribuci, and Treviri, and\r\nwhen it approaches the ocean, divides into several branches; and, having\r\nformed many and extensive islands, a great part of which are inhabited\r\nby savage and barbarous nations (of whom there are some who are supposed\r\nto live on fish and the eggs of sea-fowl), flows into the ocean by\r\nseveral mouths.\r\n\r\nXI.--When Caesar was not more than twelve miles distant from the enemy,\r\nthe ambassadors return to him, as had been arranged; who meeting him on\r\nthe march, earnestly entreated him not to advance any farther. When they\r\ncould not obtain this, they begged him to send on a despatch to those\r\nwho had marched in advance of the main army, and forbid them to engage;\r\nand grant them permission to send ambassadors to the Ubii, and if the\r\nprinces and senate of the latter would give them security by oath, they\r\nassured Caesar that they would accept such conditions as might be\r\nproposed by him; and requested that he would give them the space of\r\nthree days for negotiating these affairs. Caesar thought that these\r\nthings tended to the self-same point [as their other proposal]; [namely]\r\nthat, in consequence of a delay of three days intervening, their horse\r\nwhich were at a distance might return; however, he said, that he would\r\nnot that day advance farther than four miles for the purpose of\r\nprocuring water; he ordered that they should assemble at that place in\r\nas large a number as possible the following day, that he might inquire\r\ninto their demands. In the meantime he sends messengers to the officers\r\nwho had marched in advance with all the cavalry to order them not to\r\nprovoke the enemy to an engagement, and if they themselves were\r\nassailed, to sustain the attack until he came up with the army.\r\n\r\nXII.--But the enemy, as soon as they saw our horse, the number of which\r\nwas 5000, whereas they themselves had not more than 800 horse, because\r\nthose which had gone over the Meuse for the purpose of foraging had not\r\nreturned, while our men had no apprehensions, because their ambassadors\r\nhad gone away from Caesar a little before, and that day had been\r\nrequested by them as a period of truce, made an onset on our men, and\r\nsoon threw them into disorder. When our men, in their turn, made a\r\nstand, they, according to their practice, leaped from their horses to\r\ntheir feet, and stabbing our horses in the belly and overthrowing a\r\ngreat many of our men, put the rest to flight, and drove them forward so\r\nmuch alarmed that they did not desist from their retreat till they had\r\ncome in sight of our army. In that encounter seventy-four of our horse\r\nwere slain; among them, Piso, an Aquitanian, a most valiant man, and\r\ndescended from a very illustrious family; whose grandfather had held the\r\nsovereignty of his state, and had been styled friend by our senate. He,\r\nwhile he was endeavouring to render assistance to his brother who was\r\nsurrounded by the enemy, and whom he rescued from danger, was himself\r\nthrown from his horse, which was wounded under him, but still opposed\r\n[his antagonists] with the greatest intrepidity, as long as he was able\r\nto maintain the conflict. When at length he fell, surrounded on all\r\nsides and after receiving many wounds, and his brother, who had then\r\nretired from the fight, observed it from a distance, he spurred on his\r\nhorse, threw himself upon the enemy, and was killed.\r\n\r\nXIII.--After this engagement, Caesar considered that neither ought\r\nambassadors to be received to audience, nor conditions be accepted by\r\nhim from those who, after having sued for peace by way of stratagem and\r\ntreachery, had made war without provocation. And to wait till the\r\nenemy's forces were augmented and their cavalry had returned, he\r\nconcluded, would be the greatest madness; and knowing the fickleness of\r\nthe Gauls, he felt how much influence the enemy had already acquired\r\namong them by this one skirmish. He [therefore] deemed that no time for\r\nconverting measures ought to be afforded them. After having resolved on\r\nthese things and communicated his plans to his lieutenants and quaestor\r\nin order that he might not suffer any opportunity for engaging to escape\r\nhim, a very seasonable event occurred, namely, that on the morning of\r\nthe next day, a large body of Germans, consisting of their princes and\r\nold men, came to the camp to him to practise the same treachery and\r\ndissimulation; but, as they asserted, for the purpose of acquitting\r\nthemselves for having engaged in a skirmish the day before, contrary to\r\nwhat had been agreed and to what, indeed, they themselves had requested;\r\nand also if they could by any means obtain a truce by deceiving him.\r\nCaesar, rejoicing that they had fallen into his power, ordered them to\r\nbe detained. He then drew all his forces out of the camp, and commanded\r\nthe cavalry, because he thought they were intimidated by the late\r\nskirmish, to follow in the rear.\r\n\r\nXIV.--Having marshalled his army in three lines, and in a short time\r\nperformed a march of eight miles, he arrived at the camp of the enemy\r\nbefore the Germans could perceive what was going on; who being suddenly\r\nalarmed by all the circumstances, both by the speediness of our arrival\r\nand the absence of their own officers, as time was afforded neither for\r\nconcerting measures nor for seizing their arms, are perplexed as to\r\nwhether it would be better to lead out their forces against the enemy,\r\nor to defend their camp, or seek their safety by flight. Their\r\nconsternation being made apparent by their noise and tumult, our\r\nsoldiers, excited by the treachery of the preceding day, rushed into the\r\ncamp: such of them as could readily get their arms for a short time\r\nwithstood our men, and gave battle among their carts and baggage-waggons;\r\nbut the rest of the people, [consisting] of boys and women (for they had\r\nleft their country and crossed the Rhine with all their families), began\r\nto fly in all directions; in pursuit of whom Caesar sent the cavalry.\r\n\r\nXV.--The Germans when, upon hearing a noise behind them, [they looked\r\nand] saw that their families were being slain, throwing away their arms\r\nand abandoning their standards, fled out of the camp, and when they had\r\narrived at the confluence of the Meuse and the Rhine, the survivors\r\ndespairing of farther escape, as a great number of their countrymen had\r\nbeen killed, threw themselves into the river and there perished,\r\novercome by fear, fatigue, and the violence of the stream. Our soldiers,\r\nafter the alarm of so great a war, for the number of the enemy amounted\r\nto 430,000, returned to their camp, all safe to a man, very few being\r\neven wounded. Caesar granted those whom he had detained in the camp\r\nliberty of departing. They however, dreading revenge and torture from\r\nthe Gauls, whose lands they had harassed, said that they desired to\r\nremain with him. Caesar granted them permission.\r\n\r\nXVI.--The German war being finished, Caesar thought it expedient for him\r\nto cross the Rhine, for many reasons; of which this was the most\r\nweighty, that, since he saw the Germans were so easily urged to go into\r\nGaul, he desired they should have their fears for their own territories\r\nwhen they discovered that the army of the Roman people both could and\r\ndared pass the Rhine. There was added also, that that portion of the\r\ncavalry of the Usipetes and the Tenchtheri, which I have above related\r\nto have crossed the Meuse for the purpose of plundering and procuring\r\nforage, and was not present at the engagement, had betaken themselves,\r\nafter the retreat of their countrymen, across the Rhine into the\r\nterritories of the Sigambri, and united themselves to them. When Caesar\r\nsent ambassadors to them, to demand that they should give up to him\r\nthose who had made war against him and against Gaul, they replied, \"That\r\nthe Rhine bounded the empire of the Roman people; if he did not think it\r\njust for the Germans to pass over into Gaul against his consent, why did\r\nhe claim that anything beyond the Rhine should be subject to his\r\ndominion or power?\" The Ubii also, who alone, out of all the nations\r\nlying beyond the Rhine, had sent ambassadors to Caesar, and formed an\r\nalliance and given hostages, earnestly entreated \"that he would bring\r\nthem assistance, because they were grievously oppressed by the Suevi;\r\nor, if he was prevented from doing so by the business of the\r\ncommonwealth, he would at least transport his army over the Rhine; that\r\nthat would be sufficient for their present assistance and their hope for\r\nthe future; that so great was the name and the reputation of his army,\r\neven among the most remote nations of the Germans, arising from the\r\ndefeat of Ariovistus and this last battle which was fought, that they\r\nmight be safe under the fame and friendship of the Roman people.\" They\r\npromised a large number of ships for transporting the army.\r\n\r\nXVII.--Caesar, for those reasons which I have mentioned, had resolved to\r\ncross the Rhine; but to cross by ships he neither deemed to be\r\nsufficiently safe, nor considered consistent with his own dignity or\r\nthat of the Roman people. Therefore, although the greatest difficulty in\r\nforming a bridge was presented to him, on account of the breadth,\r\nrapidity, and depth of the river, he nevertheless considered that it\r\nought to be attempted by him, or that his army ought not otherwise to be\r\nled over. He devised this plan of a bridge. He joined together at the\r\ndistance of two feet, two piles, each a foot and a half thick, sharpened\r\na little at the lower end, and proportioned in length to the depth of\r\nthe river. After he had, by means of engines, sunk these into the river,\r\nand fixed them at the bottom, and then driven them in with rammers, not\r\nquite perpendicularly, like a stake, but bending forward and sloping, so\r\nas to incline in the direction of the current of the river; he also\r\nplaced two [other piles] opposite to these, at the distance of forty\r\nfeet lower down, fastened together in the same manner, but directed\r\nagainst the force and current of the river. Both these, moreover, were\r\nkept firmly apart by beams two feet thick (the space which the binding\r\nof the piles occupied), laid in at their extremities between two braces\r\non each side; and in consequence of these being in different directions\r\nand fastened on sides the one opposite to the other, so great was the\r\nstrength of the work, and such the arrangement of the materials, that in\r\nproportion as the greater body of water dashed against the bridge, so\r\nmuch the closer were its parts held fastened together. These beams were\r\nbound together by timber laid over them in the direction of the length\r\nof the bridge, and were [then] covered over with laths and hurdles; and\r\nin addition to this, piles were driven into the water obliquely, at the\r\nlower side of the bridge, and these serving as buttresses, and being\r\nconnected with every portion of the work, sustained the force of the\r\nstream: and there were others also above the bridge, at a moderate\r\ndistance; that if trunks of trees or vessels were floated down the river\r\nby the barbarians for the purpose of destroying the work, the violence\r\nof such things might be diminished by these defences, and might not\r\ninjure the bridge.\r\n\r\nXVIII.--Within ten days after the timber began to be collected, the\r\nwhole work was completed, and the whole army led over. Caesar, leaving a\r\nstrong guard at each end of the bridge, hastens into the territories of\r\nthe Sigambri. In the meantime ambassadors from several nations come to\r\nhim, whom, on their suing for peace and alliance, he answers in a\r\ncourteous manner, and orders hostages to be brought to him. But the\r\nSigambri, at the very time the bridge was begun to be built, made\r\npreparations for a flight (by the advice of such of the Tenchtheri and\r\nUsipetes as they had amongst them), and quitted their territories and\r\nconveyed away all their possessions, and concealed themselves in deserts\r\nand woods.\r\n\r\nXIX.--Caesar, having remained in their territories a few days, and burnt\r\nall their villages and houses, and cut down their corn, proceeded into\r\nthe territories of the Ubii; and having promised them his assistance, if\r\nthey were ever harassed by the Suevi, he learned from them these\r\nparticulars: that the Suevi, after they had by means of their scouts\r\nfound that the bridge was being built, had called a council, according\r\nto their custom, and sent orders to all parts of their state to remove\r\nfrom the towns and convey their children, wives, and all their\r\npossessions into the woods, and that all who could bear arms should\r\nassemble in one place; that the place thus chosen was nearly the centre\r\nof those regions which the Suevi possessed; that in this spot they had\r\nresolved to await the arrival of the Romans, and give them battle there.\r\nWhen Caesar discovered this, having already accomplished all those\r\nthings on account of which he had resolved to lead his army over,\r\nnamely, to strike fear into the Germans, take vengeance on the Sigambri,\r\nand free the Ubii from the invasion of the Suevi, having spent\r\naltogether eighteen days beyond the Rhine, and thinking he had advanced\r\nfar enough to serve both honour and interest, he returned into Gaul, and\r\ncut down the bridge.\r\n\r\nXX.--During the short part of summer which remained, Caesar, although in\r\nthese countries, as all Gaul lies towards the north, the winters are\r\nearly, nevertheless resolved to proceed into Britain, because he\r\ndiscovered that in almost all the wars with the Gauls succours had been\r\nfurnished to our enemy from that country; and even if the time of year\r\nshould be insufficient for carrying on the war, yet he thought it would\r\nbe of great service to him if he only entered the island, and saw into\r\nthe character of the people, and got knowledge of their localities,\r\nharbours, and landing-places, all which were for the most part unknown\r\nto the Gauls. For neither does any one except merchants generally go\r\nthither, nor even to them was any portion of it known, except the\r\nsea-coast and those parts which are opposite to Gaul. Therefore, after\r\nhaving called up to him the merchants from all parts, he could learn\r\nneither what was the size of the island, nor what or how numerous were\r\nthe nations which inhabited it, nor what system of war they followed,\r\nnor what customs they used, nor what harbours were convenient for a\r\ngreat number of large ships.\r\n\r\nXXI.--He sends before him Caius Volusenus with a ship of war, to acquire\r\na knowledge of these particulars before he in person should make a\r\ndescent into the island, as he was convinced that this was a judicious\r\nmeasure. He commissioned him to thoroughly examine into all matters, and\r\nthen return to him as soon as possible. He himself proceeds to the\r\nMorini with all his forces. He orders ships from all parts of the\r\nneighbouring countries, and the fleet which the preceding summer he had\r\nbuilt for the war with the Veneti, to assemble in this place. In the\r\nmeantime, his purpose having been discovered, and reported to the\r\nBritons by merchants, ambassadors come to him from several states of the\r\nisland, to promise that they will give hostages, and submit to the\r\ngovernment of the Roman people. Having given them an audience, he after\r\npromising liberally, and exhorting them to continue in that purpose,\r\nsends them back to their own country, and [despatches] with them\r\nCommius, whom, upon subduing the Atrebates, he had created king there, a\r\nman whose courage and conduct he esteemed, and who he thought would be\r\nfaithful to him, and whose influence ranked highly in those countries.\r\nHe orders him to visit as many states as he could, and persuade them to\r\nembrace the protection of the Roman people, and apprise them that he\r\nwould shortly come thither. Volusenus, having viewed the localities as\r\nfar as means could be afforded one who dared not leave his ship and\r\ntrust himself to barbarians, returns to Caesar on the fifth day, and\r\nreports what he had there observed.\r\n\r\nXXII.--While Caesar remains in these parts for the purpose of procuring\r\nships, ambassadors come to him from a great portion of the Morini, to\r\nplead their excuse respecting their conduct on the late occasion;\r\nalleging that it was as men uncivilised, and as those who were\r\nunacquainted with our custom, that they had made war upon the Roman\r\npeople, and promising to perform what he should command. Caesar,\r\nthinking that this had happened fortunately enough for him, because he\r\nneither wished to leave an enemy behind him, nor had an opportunity for\r\ncarrying on a war, by reason of the time of year, nor considered that\r\nemployment in such trifling matters was to be preferred to his\r\nenterprise on Britain, imposes a large number of hostages; and when\r\nthese were brought, he received them to his protection. Having collected\r\ntogether and provided about eighty transport ships, as many as he\r\nthought necessary for conveying over two legions, he assigned such\r\n[ships] of war as he had besides to the quaestor, his lieutenants, and\r\nofficers of cavalry. There were in addition to these eighteen ships of\r\nburden which were prevented, eight miles from that place, by winds, from\r\nbeing able to reach the same port. These he distributed amongst the\r\nhorse; the rest of the army he delivered to Q. Titurius Sabinus and L.\r\nAurunculeius Cotta, his lieutenants, to lead into the territories of the\r\nMenapii and those cantons of the Morini from which ambassadors had not\r\ncome to him. He ordered P. Sulpicius Rufus, his lieutenant, to hold\r\npossession of the harbour, with such a garrison as he thought\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nXXIII.--These matters being arranged, finding the weather favourable for\r\nhis voyage, he set sail about the third watch, and ordered the horse to\r\nmarch forward to the farther port, and there embark and follow him. As\r\nthis was performed rather tardily by them, he himself reached Britain\r\nwith the first squadron of ships, about the fourth hour of the day, and\r\nthere saw the forces of the enemy drawn up in arms on all the hills. The\r\nnature of the place was this: the sea was confined by mountains so close\r\nto it that a dart could be thrown from their summit upon the shore.\r\nConsidering this by no means a fit place for disembarking, he remained\r\nat anchor till the ninth hour, for the other ships to arrive there.\r\nHaving in the meantime assembled the lieutenants and military tribunes,\r\nhe told them both what he had learnt from Volusenus, and what he wished\r\nto be done; and enjoined them (as the principle of military matters, and\r\nespecially as maritime affairs, which have a precipitate and uncertain\r\naction, required) that all things should be performed by them at a nod\r\nand at the instant. Having dismissed them, meeting both with wind and\r\ntide favourable at the same time, the signal being given and the anchor\r\nweighed, he advanced about seven miles from that place, and stationed\r\nhis fleet over against an open and level shore.\r\n\r\nXXIV.--But the barbarians, upon perceiving the design of the Romans,\r\nsent forward their cavalry and charioteers, a class of warriors of whom\r\nit is their practice to make great use in their battles, and following\r\nwith the rest of their forces, endeavoured to prevent our men landing.\r\nIn this was the greatest difficulty, for the following reasons, namely,\r\nbecause our ships, on account of their great size, could be stationed\r\nonly in deep water; and our soldiers, in places unknown to them, with\r\ntheir hands embarrassed, oppressed with a large and heavy weight of\r\narmour, had at the same time to leap from the ships, stand amidst the\r\nwaves, and encounter the enemy; whereas they, either on dry ground, or\r\nadvancing a little way into the water, free in all their limbs, in\r\nplaces thoroughly known to them, could confidently throw their weapons\r\nand spur on their horses, which were accustomed to this kind of service.\r\nDismayed by these circumstances and altogether untrained in this mode of\r\nbattle, our men did not all exert the same vigour and eagerness which\r\nthey had been wont to exert in engagements on dry ground.\r\n\r\nXXV.--When Caesar observed this, he ordered the ships of war, the\r\nappearance of which was somewhat strange to the barbarians and the\r\nmotion more ready for service, to be withdrawn a little from the\r\ntransport vessels, and to be propelled by their oars, and be stationed\r\ntowards the open flank of the enemy, and the enemy to be beaten off and\r\ndriven away with slings, arrows, and engines: which plan was of great\r\nservice to our men; for the barbarians being startled by the form of our\r\nships and the motions of our oars and the nature of our engines, which\r\nwas strange to them, stopped, and shortly after retreated a little. And\r\nwhile our men were hesitating [whether they should advance to the\r\nshore], chiefly on account of the depth of the sea, he who carried the\r\neagle of the tenth legion, after supplicating the gods that the matter\r\nmight turn out favourably to the legion, exclaimed, \"Leap, fellow\r\nsoldiers, unless you wish to betray your eagle to the enemy. I, for my\r\npart, will perform my duty to the commonwealth and my general.\" When he\r\nhad said this with a loud voice, he leaped from the ship and proceeded\r\nto bear the eagle toward the enemy. Then our men, exhorting one another\r\nthat so great a disgrace should not be incurred, all leaped from the\r\nship. When those in the nearest vessels saw them, they speedily followed\r\nand approached the enemy.\r\n\r\nXXVI.--The battle was maintained vigorously on both sides. Our men,\r\nhowever, as they could neither keep their ranks, nor get firm footing,\r\nnor follow their standards, and as one from one ship and another from\r\nanother assembled around whatever standards they met, were thrown into\r\ngreat confusion. But the enemy, who were acquainted with all the\r\nshallows, when from the shore they saw any coming from a ship one by\r\none, spurred on their horses, and attacked them while embarrassed; many\r\nsurrounded a few, others threw their weapons upon our collected forces\r\non their exposed flank. When Caesar observed this, he ordered the boats\r\nof the ships of war and the spy sloops to be filled with soldiers, and\r\nsent them up to the succour of those whom he had observed in distress.\r\nOur men, as soon as they made good their footing on dry ground, and all\r\ntheir comrades had joined them, made an attack upon the enemy, and put\r\nthem to flight, but could not pursue them very far, because the horse\r\nhad not been able to maintain their course at sea and reach the island.\r\nThis alone was wanting to Caesar's accustomed success.\r\n\r\nXXVII.--The enemy being thus vanquished in battle, as soon as they\r\nrecovered after their flight, instantly sent ambassadors to Caesar to\r\nnegotiate about peace. They promised to give hostages and perform what\r\nhe should command. Together with these ambassadors came Commius the\r\nAtrebatian, who, as I have above said, had been sent by Caesar into\r\nBritain. Him they had seized upon when leaving his ship, although in the\r\ncharacter of ambassador he bore the general's commission to them, and\r\nthrown into chains: then after the battle was fought, they sent him\r\nback, and in suing for peace cast the blame of that act upon the common\r\npeople, and entreated that it might be pardoned on account of their\r\nindiscretion. Caesar, complaining that after they had sued for peace,\r\nand had voluntarily sent ambassadors into the continent for that\r\npurpose, they had made war without a reason, said that he would pardon\r\ntheir indiscretion, and imposed hostages, a part of whom they gave\r\nimmediately; the rest they said they would give in a few days, since\r\nthey were sent for from remote places. In the meantime they ordered\r\ntheir people to return to the country parts, and the chiefs assembled\r\nfrom all quarters, and proceeded to surrender themselves and their\r\nstates to Caesar.\r\n\r\nXXVIII.--A peace being established by these proceedings four days after\r\nwe had come into Britain, the eighteen ships, to which reference has\r\nbeen made above, and which conveyed the cavalry, set sail from the upper\r\nport with a gentle gale; when, however, they were approaching Britain\r\nand were seen from the camp, so great a storm suddenly arose that none\r\nof them could maintain their course at sea; and some were taken back to\r\nthe same port from which they had started;--others, to their great\r\ndanger, were driven to the lower part of the island, nearer to the west;\r\nwhich, however, after having cast anchor, as they were getting filled\r\nwith water, put out to sea through necessity in a stormy night, and made\r\nfor the continent.\r\n\r\nXXIX.--It happened that night to be full moon, which usually occasions\r\nvery high tides in that ocean; and that circumstance was unknown to our\r\nmen. Thus, at the same time, the tide began to fill the ships of war\r\nwhich Caesar had provided to convey over his army, and which he had\r\ndrawn up on the strand; and the storm began to dash the ships of burden\r\nwhich were riding at anchor against each other; nor was any means\r\nafforded our men of either managing them or of rendering any service. A\r\ngreat many ships having been wrecked, inasmuch as the rest, having lost\r\ntheir cables, anchors, and other tackling, were unfit for sailing, a\r\ngreat confusion, as would necessarily happen, arose throughout the army;\r\nfor there were no other ships in which they could be conveyed back, and\r\nall things which are of service in repairing vessels were wanting, and\r\ncorn for the winter had not been provided in those places, because it\r\nwas understood by all that they would certainly winter in Gaul.\r\n\r\nXXX.--On discovering these things the chiefs of Britain, who had come up\r\nafter the battle was fought to perform those conditions which Caesar had\r\nimposed, held a conference, when they perceived that cavalry, and ships,\r\nand corn were wanting to the Romans, and discovered the small number of\r\nour soldiers from the small extent of the camp (which, too, was on this\r\naccount more limited than ordinary because Caesar had conveyed over his\r\nlegions without baggage), and thought that the best plan was to renew\r\nthe war, and cut off our men from corn and provisions and protract the\r\naffair till winter; because they felt confident that, if they were\r\nvanquished or cut off from a return, no one would afterwards pass over\r\ninto Britain for the purpose of making war. Therefore, again entering\r\ninto a conspiracy, they began to depart from the camp by degrees and\r\nsecretly bring up their people from the country parts.\r\n\r\nXXXI.--But Caesar, although he had not as yet discovered their measures,\r\nyet, both from what had occurred to his ships, and from the circumstance\r\nthat they had neglected to give the promised hostages, suspected that\r\nthe thing would come to pass which really did happen. He therefore\r\nprovided remedies against all contingencies; for he daily conveyed corn\r\nfrom the country parts into the camp, used the timber and brass of such\r\nships as were most seriously damaged for repairing the rest, and ordered\r\nwhatever things besides were necessary for this object to be brought to\r\nhim from the continent. And thus, since that business was executed by\r\nthe soldiers with the greatest energy, he effected that, after the loss\r\nof twelve ships, a voyage could be made well enough in the rest.\r\n\r\nXXXII.--While these things are being transacted, one legion had been\r\nsent to forage, according to custom, and no suspicion of war had arisen\r\nas yet, and some of the people remained in the country parts, others\r\nwent backwards and forwards to the camp, they who were on duty at the\r\ngates of the camp reported to Caesar that a greater dust than was usual\r\nwas seen in that direction in which the legion had marched. Caesar,\r\nsuspecting that which was [really the case],--that some new enterprise\r\nwas undertaken by the barbarians, ordered the two cohorts which were on\r\nduty to march into that quarter with him, and two other cohorts to\r\nrelieve them on duty; the rest to be armed and follow him immediately.\r\nWhen he had advanced some little way from the camp, he saw that his men\r\nwere overpowered by the enemy and scarcely able to stand their ground,\r\nand that, the legion being crowded together, weapons were being cast on\r\nthem from all sides. For as all the corn was reaped in every part with\r\nthe exception of one, the enemy, suspecting that our men would repair to\r\nthat, had concealed themselves in the woods during the night. Then\r\nattacking them suddenly, scattered as they were, and when they had laid\r\naside their arms, and were engaged in reaping, they killed a small\r\nnumber, threw the rest into confusion, and surrounded them with their\r\ncavalry and chariots.\r\n\r\nXXXIII.--Their mode of fighting with their chariots is this: firstly,\r\nthey drive about in all directions and throw their weapons and generally\r\nbreak the ranks of the enemy with the very dread of their horses and the\r\nnoise of their wheels; and when they have worked themselves in between\r\nthe troops of horse, leap from their chariots and engage on foot. The\r\ncharioteers in the meantime withdraw some little distance from the\r\nbattle, and so place themselves with the chariots that, if their masters\r\nare overpowered by the number of the enemy, they may have a ready\r\nretreat to their own troops. Thus they display in battle the speed of\r\nhorse, [together with] the firmness of infantry; and by daily practice\r\nand exercise attain to such expertness that they are accustomed, even on\r\na declining and steep place, to check their horses at full speed, and\r\nmanage and turn them in an instant and run along the pole, and stand on\r\nthe yoke, and thence betake themselves with the greatest celerity to\r\ntheir chariots again.\r\n\r\nXXXIV.-Under these circumstances, our men being dismayed by the novelty\r\nof this mode of battle, Caesar most seasonably brought assistance; for\r\nupon his arrival the enemy paused, and our men recovered from their\r\nfear; upon which, thinking the time unfavourable for provoking the enemy\r\nand coming to an action, he kept himself in his own quarter, and, a\r\nshort time having intervened, drew back the legions into the camp. While\r\nthese things were going on, and all our men engaged, the rest of the\r\nBritons, who were in the fields, departed. Storms then set in for\r\nseveral successive days, which both confined our men to camp and\r\nhindered the enemy from attacking us. In the meantime the barbarians\r\ndespatched messengers to all parts and reported to their people the\r\nsmall number of our soldiers, and how good an opportunity was given for\r\nobtaining spoil and for liberating themselves for ever, if they should\r\nonly drive the Romans from their camp. Having by these means speedily\r\ngot together a large force of infantry and of cavalry, they came up to\r\nthe camp.\r\n\r\nXXXV.--Although Caesar anticipated that the same thing which had\r\nhappened on former occasions would then occur--that, if the enemy were\r\nrouted, they would escape from danger by their speed; still, having got\r\nabout thirty horse, which Commius the Atrebatian, of whom mention has\r\nbeen made, had brought over with him [from Gaul], he drew up the legions\r\nin order of battle before the camp. When the action commenced, the enemy\r\nwere unable to sustain the attack of our men long, and turned their\r\nbacks; our men pursued them as far as their speed and strength\r\npermitted, and slew a great number of them; then, having destroyed and\r\nburnt everything far and wide, they retreated to their camp.\r\n\r\nXXXVI.--The same day, ambassadors sent by the enemy came to Caesar to\r\nnegotiate a peace. Caesar doubled the number of hostages which he had\r\nbefore demanded; and ordered that they should be brought over to the\r\ncontinent, because, since the time of the equinox was near, he did not\r\nconsider that, with his ships out of repair, the voyage ought to be\r\ndeferred till winter. Having met with favourable weather he set sail a\r\nlittle after midnight, and all his fleet arrived safe at the continent,\r\nexcept two of the ships of burden which could not make the same port\r\nwhich the other ships did, and were carried a little lower down.\r\n\r\nXXXVII.--When our soldiers, about 300 in number, had been drawn out of\r\nthese two ships, and were marching to the camp, the Morini, whom Caesar,\r\nwhen setting forth for Britain, had left in a state of peace, excited by\r\nthe hope of spoil, at first surrounded them with a small number of men,\r\nand ordered them to lay down their arms, if they did not wish to be\r\nslain; afterwards however, when they, forming a circle, stood on their\r\ndefence, a shout was raised and about 6000 of the enemy soon assembled;\r\nwhich being reported, Caesar sent all the cavalry in the camp as a\r\nrelief to his men. In the meantime our soldiers sustained the attack of\r\nthe enemy, and fought most valiantly for more than four hours, and,\r\nreceiving but few wounds themselves, slew several of them. But after our\r\ncavalry came in sight, the enemy, throwing away their arms, turned their\r\nbacks, and a great number of them were killed.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII.--The day following Caesar sent Labienus, his lieutenant, with\r\nthose legions which he had brought back from Britain, against the\r\nMorini, who had revolted; who, as they had no place to which they might\r\nretreat, on account of the drying up of their marshes (which they had\r\navailed themselves of as a place of refuge the preceding year), almost\r\nall fell into the power of Labienus. In the meantime Caesar's\r\nlieutenants, Q. Titurius and L. Cotta, who had led the legions into the\r\nterritories of the Menapii, having laid waste all their lands, cut down\r\ntheir corn and burnt their houses, returned to Caesar because the\r\nMenapii had all concealed themselves in their thickest woods. Caesar\r\nfixed the winter quarters of all the legions amongst the Belgae. Thither\r\nonly two British states sent hostages; the rest omitted to do so. For\r\nthese successes, a thanksgiving of twenty days was decreed by the senate\r\nupon receiving Caesar's letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V\r\n\r\nI.--Lucius Domitius and Appius Claudius being consuls, Caesar when\r\ndeparting from his winter quarters into Italy, as he had been accustomed\r\nto do yearly, commands the lieutenants whom he appointed over the\r\nlegions to take care that during the winter as many ships as possible\r\nshould be built, and the old repaired. He plans the size and shape of\r\nthem. For despatch of lading, and for drawing them on shore, he makes\r\nthem a little lower than those which we have been accustomed to use in\r\nour sea; and that so much the more, because he knew that, on account of\r\nthe frequent changes of the tide, less swells occurred there; for the\r\npurpose of transporting little and a great number of horses, [he makes\r\nthem] a little broader than those which we use in other seas. All these\r\nhe orders to be constructed for lightness and expedition, to which\r\nobject their lowness contributes greatly. He orders those things which\r\nare necessary for equipping ships to be brought thither from Spain. He\r\nhimself, on the assizes of Hither Gaul being concluded, proceeds into\r\nIllyricum, because he heard that the part of the province nearest them\r\nwas being laid waste by the incursions of the Pirustae. When he had\r\narrived there, he levies soldiers upon the states, and orders them to\r\nassemble at an appointed place. Which circumstance having been reported\r\n[to them], the Pirustae send ambassadors to him to inform him that no\r\npart of those proceedings was done by public deliberation, and assert\r\nthat they were ready to make compensation by all means for the injuries\r\n[inflicted]. Caesar, accepting their defence, demands hostages, and\r\norders them to be brought to him on a specified day, and assures them\r\nthat unless they did so he would visit their state with war. These being\r\nbrought to him on the day which he had ordered, he appoints arbitrators\r\nbetween the states, who should estimate the damages and determine the\r\nreparation.\r\n\r\nII.--These things being finished, and the assizes being concluded, he\r\nreturns into Hither Gaul, and proceeds thence to the army. When he had\r\narrived there, having made a survey of the winter quarter, he finds\r\nthat, by the extraordinary ardour of the soldiers, amidst the utmost\r\nscarcity of all materials, about six hundred ships of that kind which we\r\nhave described above, and twenty-eight ships of war, had been built, and\r\nwere not far from that state that they might be launched in a few days.\r\nHaving commended the soldiers and those who had presided over the work,\r\nhe informs them what he wishes to be done, and orders all the ships to\r\nassemble at port Itius, from which port he had learned that the passage\r\ninto Britain was shortest, [being only] about thirty miles from the\r\ncontinent. He left what seemed a sufficient number of soldiers for that\r\ndesign; he himself proceeds into the territories of the Treviri with\r\nfour legions without baggage, and 800 horse, because they neither came\r\nto the general diets [of Gaul], nor obeyed his commands, and were,\r\nmoreover, said to be tampering with the Germans beyond the Rhine.\r\n\r\nIII.--This state is by far the most powerful of all Gaul in cavalry, and\r\nhas great forces of infantry, and as we have remarked above, borders on\r\nthe Rhine. In that state, two persons, Indutiomarus and Cingetorix, were\r\nthen contending with each other for the supreme power; one of whom, as\r\nsoon as the arrival of Caesar and his legions was known, came to him;\r\nassures him that he and all his party would continue in their\r\nallegiance, and not revolt from the alliance of the Roman people, and\r\ninforms him of the things which were going on amongst the Treviri. But\r\nIndutiomarus began to collect cavalry and infantry, and make\r\npreparations for war, having concealed those who by reason of their age\r\ncould not be under arms in the forest Arduenna, which is of immense\r\nsize, [and] extends from the Rhine across the country of the Treviri to\r\nthe frontiers of the Remi. But after that, some of the chief persons of\r\nthe state, both influenced by their friendship for Cingetorix, and\r\nalarmed at the arrival of our army, came to Caesar and began to solicit\r\nhim privately about their own interests, since they could not provide\r\nfor the safety of the state; Indutiomarus, dreading lest he should be\r\nabandoned by all, sends ambassadors to Caesar, to declare that he\r\nabsented himself from his countrymen, and refrained from coming to him\r\non this account, that he might the more easily keep the state in its\r\nallegiance, lest on the departure of all the nobility the commonalty\r\nshould, in their indiscretion, revolt. And thus the whole state was at\r\nhis control; and that he, if Caesar would permit, would come to the camp\r\nto him, and would commit his own fortunes and those of the state to his\r\ngood faith.\r\n\r\nIV.--Caesar, though he discerned from what motive these things were\r\nsaid, and what circumstance deterred him from his meditated plan, still,\r\nin order that he might not be compelled to waste the summer among the\r\nTreviri, while all things were prepared for the war with Britain,\r\nordered Indutiomarus to come to him with 200 hostages. When these were\r\nbrought, [and] among them his son and near relations whom he had\r\ndemanded by name, he consoled Indutiomarus, and enjoined him to continue\r\nin his allegiance; yet, nevertheless, summoning to him the chief men of\r\nthe Treviri, he reconciled them individually to Cingetorix: this he both\r\nthought should be done by him in justice to the merits of the latter,\r\nand also judged that it was of great importance that the influence of\r\none whose singular attachment towards him he had fully seen, should\r\nprevail as much as possible among his people. Indutiomarus was very much\r\noffended at this act, [seeing that] his influence was diminished among\r\nhis countrymen; and he, who already before had borne a hostile mind\r\ntowards us, was much more violently inflamed against us through\r\nresentment at this.\r\n\r\nV.--These matters being settled, Caesar went to port Itius with the\r\nlegions. There he discovers that forty ships which had been built in the\r\ncountry of the Meldi, having been driven back by a storm, had been\r\nunable to maintain their course, and had returned to the same port from\r\nwhich they had set out; he finds the rest ready for sailing, and\r\nfurnished with everything. In the same place, the cavalry of the whole\r\nof Gaul, in number 4000, assembles, and [also] the chief persons of all\r\nthe states; he had determined to leave in Gaul a very few of them, whose\r\nfidelity towards him he had clearly discerned, and take the rest with\r\nhim as hostages; because he feared a commotion in Gaul when he should be\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\nVI.--There was together with the others, Dumnorix, the Aeduan, of whom\r\nwe have made previous mention. Him in particular he had resolved to have\r\nwith him, because he had discovered him to be fond of change, fond of\r\npower, possessing great resolution, and great influence among the Gauls.\r\nTo this was added that Dumnorix had before said in an assembly of\r\nAeduans, that the sovereignty of the state had been made over to him by\r\nCaesar; which speech the Aedui bore with impatience and yet dared not\r\nsend ambassadors to Caesar for the purpose of either rejecting or\r\ndeprecating [that appointment]. That fact Caesar had learned from his\r\nown personal friends. He at first strove to obtain by every entreaty\r\nthat he should be left in Gaul; partly, because, being unaccustomed to\r\nsailing, he feared the sea; partly, because he said he was prevented by\r\ndivine admonitions. After he saw that this request was firmly refused\r\nhim, all hope of success being lost, he began to tamper with the chief\r\npersons of the Gauls, to call them apart singly and exhort them to\r\nremain on the continent; to agitate them with the fear that it was not\r\nwithout reason that Gaul should be stript of all her nobility; that it\r\nwas Caesar's design to bring over to Britain and put to death all those\r\nwhom he feared to slay in the sight of Gaul, to pledge his honour to the\r\nrest, to ask for their oath that they would by common deliberation\r\nexecute what they should perceive to be necessary for Gaul. These things\r\nwere reported to Caesar by several persons.\r\n\r\nVII.--Having learned this fact, Caesar, because he had conferred so much\r\nhonour upon the Aeduan state, determined that Dumnorix should be\r\nrestrained and deterred by whatever means he could; and that, because he\r\nperceived his insane designs to be proceeding farther and farther, care\r\nshould be taken lest he might be able to injure him and the\r\ncommonwealth. Therefore, having stayed about twenty-five days in that\r\nplace, because the north wind, which usually blows a great part of every\r\nseason, prevented the voyage, he exerted himself to keep Dumnorix in his\r\nallegiance [and] nevertheless learn all his measures: having at length\r\nmet with favourable weather, he orders the foot soldiers and the horse\r\nto embark in the ships. But, while the minds of all were occupied,\r\nDumnorix began to take his departure from the camp homewards with the\r\ncavalry of the Aedui, Caesar being ignorant of it. Caesar, on this\r\nmatter being reported to him, ceasing from his expedition and deferring\r\nall other affairs, sends a great part of the cavalry to pursue him, and\r\ncommands that he be brought back; he orders that if he use violence and\r\ndo not submit, that he be slain: considering that Dumnorix would do\r\nnothing as a rational man while he himself was absent, since he had\r\ndisregarded his command even when present. He, however, when recalled,\r\nbegan to resist and defend himself with his hand, and implore the\r\nsupport of his people, often exclaiming that \"he was free and the\r\nsubject of a free state.\" They surround and kill the man as they had\r\nbeen commanded; but the Aeduan horsemen all return to Caesar.\r\n\r\nVIII.--When these things were done [and] Labienus, left on the continent\r\nwith three legions and 2000 horse, to defend the harbours and provide\r\ncorn, and discover what was going on in Gaul, and take measures\r\naccording to the occasion and according to the circumstance; he himself,\r\nwith five legions and a number of horse, equal to that which he was\r\nleaving on the continent, set sail at sunset and [though for a time]\r\nborne forward by a gentle south-west wind, he did not maintain his\r\ncourse, in consequence of the wind dying away about midnight, and being\r\ncarried on too far by the tide, when the sun rose, espied Britain passed\r\non his left. Then, again, following the change of tide, he urged on with\r\nthe oars that he might make that port of the island in which he had\r\ndiscovered the preceding summer that there was the best landing-place,\r\nand in this affair the spirit of our soldiers was very much to be\r\nextolled; for they with the transports and heavy ships, the labour of\r\nrowing not being [for a moment] discontinued, equalled the speed of the\r\nships of war. All the ships reached Britain nearly at mid-day; nor was\r\nthere seen a [single] enemy in that place, but, as Caesar afterwards\r\nfound from some prisoners, though large bodies of troops had assembled\r\nthere, yet being alarmed by the great number of our ships, more than\r\neight hundred of which, including the ships of the preceding year, and\r\nthose private vessels which each had built for his own convenience, had\r\nappeared at one time, they had quitted the coast and concealed\r\nthemselves among the higher points.\r\n\r\nIX.--Caesar, having disembarked his army and chosen a convenient place\r\nfor the camp, when he discovered from the prisoners in what part the\r\nforces of the enemy had lodged themselves, having left ten cohorts and\r\n300 horse at the sea, to be a guard to the ships, hastens to the enemy,\r\nat the third watch, fearing the less for the ships for this reason,\r\nbecause he was leaving them fastened at anchor upon an even and open\r\nshore; and he placed Q. Atrius over the guard of the ships. He himself,\r\nhaving advanced by night about twelve miles, espied the forces of the\r\nenemy. They, advancing to the river with their cavalry and chariots from\r\nthe higher ground, began to annoy our men and give battle. Being\r\nrepulsed by our cavalry, they concealed themselves in woods, as they had\r\nsecured a place admirably fortified by nature and by art, which, as it\r\nseemed, they had before prepared on account of a civil war; for all\r\nentrances to it were shut up by a great number of felled trees. They\r\nthemselves rushed out of the woods to fight here and there, and\r\nprevented our men from entering their fortifications. But the soldiers\r\nof the seventh legion, having formed a testudo and thrown up a rampart\r\nagainst the fortification, took the place and drove them out of the\r\nwoods, receiving only a few wounds. But Caesar forbade his men to pursue\r\nthem in their flight any great distance; both because he was ignorant of\r\nthe nature of the ground, and because, as a great part of the day was\r\nspent, he wished time to be left for the fortification of the camp.\r\n\r\nX.--The next day, early in the morning, he sent both foot-soldiers and\r\nhorse in three divisions on an expedition to pursue those who had fled.\r\nThese having advanced a little way, when already the rear [of the enemy]\r\nwas in sight, some horse came to Caesar from Quintus Atrius, to report\r\nthat the preceding night, a very great storm having arisen, almost all\r\nthe ships were dashed to pieces and cast upon the shore, because neither\r\nthe anchors and cables could resist, nor could the sailors and pilots\r\nsustain the violence of the storm; and thus great damage was received by\r\nthat collision of the ships.\r\n\r\nXI.--These things being known [to him], Caesar orders the legions and\r\ncavalry to be recalled and to cease from their march; he himself returns\r\nto the ships: he sees clearly before him almost the same things which he\r\nhad heard of from the messengers and by letter, so that, about forty\r\nships being lost, the remainder seemed capable of being repaired with\r\nmuch labour. Therefore he selects workmen from the legions, and orders\r\nothers to be sent for from the continent; he writes to Labienus to build\r\nas many ships as he could with those legions which were with him. He\r\nhimself, though the matter was one of great difficulty and labour, yet\r\nthought it to be most expedient for all the ships to be brought up on\r\nshore and joined with the camp by one fortification. In these matters he\r\nemployed about ten days, the labour of the soldiers being unremitting\r\neven during the hours of night. The ships having been brought up on\r\nshore and the camp strongly fortified, he left the same forces which he\r\ndid before as a guard for the ships; he sets out in person for the same\r\nplace that he had returned from. When he had come thither, greater\r\nforces of the Britons had already assembled at that place, the chief\r\ncommand and management of the war having been entrusted to\r\nCassivellaunus, whose territories a river, which is called the Thames,\r\nseparates from the maritime states at about eighty miles from the sea.\r\nAt an earlier period perpetual wars had taken place between him and the\r\nother states; but, greatly alarmed by our arrival, the Britons had\r\nplaced him over the whole war and the conduct of it.\r\n\r\nXII.--The interior portion of Britain is inhabited by those of whom they\r\nsay that it is handed down by tradition that they were born in the\r\nisland itself: the maritime portion by those who had passed over from\r\nthe country of the Belgae for the purpose of plunder and making war;\r\nalmost all of whom are called by the names of those states from which\r\nbeing sprung they went thither, and having waged war, continued there\r\nand began to cultivate the lands. The number of the people is countless,\r\nand their buildings exceedingly numerous, for the most part very like\r\nthose of the Gauls: the number of cattle is great. They use either brass\r\nor iron rings, determined at a certain weight, as their money. Tin is\r\nproduced in the midland regions; in the maritime, iron; but the quantity\r\nof it is small: they employ brass, which is imported. There, as in Gaul,\r\nis timber of every description, except beech and fir. They do not regard\r\nit lawful to eat the hare, and the cock, and the goose; they, however,\r\nbreed them for amusement and pleasure. The climate is more temperate\r\nthan in Gaul, the colds being less severe.\r\n\r\nXIII.--The island is triangular in its form, and one of its sides is\r\nopposite to Gaul. One angle of this side, which is in Kent, whither\r\nalmost all ships from Gaul are directed, [looks] to the east; the lower\r\nlooks to the south. This side extends about 500 miles. Another side lies\r\ntowards Spain and the west, on which part is Ireland, less, as is\r\nreckoned, than Britain by one-half; but the passage [from it] into\r\nBritain is of equal distance with that from Gaul. In the middle of this\r\nvoyage is an island, which is called Mona; many smaller islands besides\r\nare supposed to lie [there], of which islands some have written that at\r\nthe time of the winter solstice it is night there for thirty consecutive\r\ndays. We, in our inquiries about that matter, ascertained nothing,\r\nexcept that, by accurate measurements with water, we perceived the\r\nnights to be shorter there than on the continent. The length of this\r\nside, as their account states, is 700 miles. The third side is towards\r\nthe north, to which portion of the island no land is opposite; but an\r\nangle of that side looks principally towards Germany. This side is\r\nconsidered to be 800 miles in length. Thus the whole island is [about]\r\n2000 miles in circumference.\r\n\r\nXIV.--The most civilised of all these nations are they who inhabit Kent,\r\nwhich is entirely a maritime district, nor do they differ much from the\r\nGallic customs. Most of the inland inhabitants do not sow corn, but live\r\non milk and flesh, and are clad with skins. All the Britons, indeed, dye\r\nthemselves with wood, which occasions a bluish colour, and thereby have\r\na more terrible appearance in fight. They wear their hair long, and have\r\nevery part of their body shaved except their head and upper lip. Ten and\r\neven twelve have wives common to them, and particularly brothers among\r\nbrothers, and parents among their children; but if there be any issue by\r\nthese wives, they are reputed to be the children of those by whom\r\nrespectively each was first espoused when a virgin.\r\n\r\nXV.--The horse and charioteers of the enemy contended vigorously in a\r\nskirmish with our cavalry on the march; yet so that our men were\r\nconquerors in all parts, and drove them to their woods and hills; but,\r\nhaving slain a great many, they pursued too eagerly, and lost some of\r\ntheir men. But the enemy, after some time had elapsed, when our men were\r\noff their guard, and occupied in the fortification of the camp, rushed\r\nout of the woods, and making an attack upon those who were placed on\r\nduty before the camp, fought in a determined manner; and two cohorts\r\nbeing sent by Caesar to their relief, and these severally the first of\r\ntwo legions, when these had taken up their position at a very small\r\ndistance from each other, as our men were disconcerted by the unusual\r\nmode of battle, the enemy broke through the middle of them most\r\ncourageously, and retreated thence in safety. That day, Q. Laberius\r\nDurus, a tribune of the soldiers, was slain. The enemy, since more\r\ncohorts were sent against them, were repulsed.\r\n\r\nXVI.--In the whole of this method of fighting since the engagement took\r\nplace under the eyes of all and before the camp, it was perceived that\r\nour men, on account of the weight of their arms, inasmuch as they could\r\nneither pursue [the enemy when] retreating, nor dare quit their\r\nstandards, were little suited to this kind of enemy; that the horse also\r\nfought with great danger, because they [the Britons] generally retreated\r\neven designedly, and, when they had drawn off our men a short distance\r\nfrom the legions, leaped from their chariots and fought on foot in\r\nunequal [and to them advantageous] battle. But the system of cavalry\r\nengagement is wont to produce equal danger, and indeed the same, both to\r\nthose who retreat and those who pursue. To this was added, that they\r\nnever fought in close order, but in small parties and at great\r\ndistances, and had detachments placed [in different parts], and then the\r\none relieved the other, and the vigorous and fresh succeeded the\r\nwearied.\r\n\r\nXVII.--The following day the enemy halted on the hills, a distance from\r\nour camp, and presented themselves in small parties, and began to\r\nchallenge our horse to battle with less spirit than the day before. But\r\nat noon, when Caesar had sent three legions, and all the cavalry with C.\r\nTrebonius, the lieutenant, for the purpose of foraging, they flew upon\r\nthe foragers suddenly from all quarters, so that they did not keep off\r\n[even] from the standards and the legions. Our men making an attack on\r\nthem vigorously, repulsed them; nor did they cease to pursue them until\r\nthe horse, relying on relief, as they saw the legions behind them, drove\r\nthe enemy precipitately before them, and, slaying a great number of\r\nthem, did not give them the opportunity either of rallying or halting,\r\nor leaping from their chariots. Immediately after this retreat, the\r\nauxiliaries who had assembled from all sides, departed; nor after that\r\ntime did the enemy ever engage with us in very large numbers.\r\n\r\nXVIII.--Caesar, discovering their design, leads his army into the\r\nterritories of Cassivellaunus to the river Thames; which river can be\r\nforded in one place only, and that with difficulty. When he had arrived\r\nthere, he perceives that numerous forces of the enemy were marshalled on\r\nthe other bank of the river; the bank also was defended by sharp stakes\r\nfixed in front, and stakes of the same kind fixed under the water were\r\ncovered by the river. These things being discovered from [some]\r\nprisoners and deserters, Caesar, sending forward the cavalry, ordered\r\nthe legions to follow them immediately. But the soldiers advanced with\r\nsuch speed and such ardour, though they stood above the water by their\r\nheads only, that the enemy could not sustain the attack of the legions\r\nand of the horse, and quitted the banks, and committed themselves to\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nXIX.--Cassivellaunus, as we have stated above, all hope [rising out] of\r\nbattle being laid aside, the greater part of his forces being dismissed,\r\nand about 4000 charioteers only being left, used to observe our marches\r\nand retire a little from the road, and conceal himself in intricate and\r\nwoody places, and in those neighbourhoods in which he had discovered we\r\nwere about to march, he used to drive the cattle and the inhabitants\r\nfrom the fields into the woods; and, when our cavalry, for the sake of\r\nplundering and ravaging the more freely, scattered themselves among the\r\nfields, he used to send out charioteers from the woods by all the\r\nwell-known roads and paths, and, to the great danger of our horse, engage\r\nwith them; and this source of fear hindered them from straggling very\r\nextensively. The result was that Caesar did not allow excursions to be\r\nmade to a great distance from the main body of the legions, and ordered\r\nthat damage should be done to the enemy in ravaging their lands and\r\nkindling fires only so far as the legionary soldiers could, by their own\r\nexertion and marching, accomplish it.\r\n\r\nXX.--In the meantime, the Trinobantes, almost the most powerful state of\r\nthose parts, from which the young man Mandubratius embracing the\r\nprotection of Caesar had come to the continent of Gaul to [meet] him\r\n(whose father, Imanuentius, had possessed the sovereignty in that state,\r\nand had been killed by Cassivellaunus; he himself had escaped death by\r\nflight), send ambassadors to Caesar, and promise that they will\r\nsurrender themselves to him and perform his commands; they entreat him\r\nto protect Mandubratius from the violence of Cassivellaunus, and send to\r\ntheir state some one to preside over it, and possess the government.\r\nCaesar demands forty hostages from them, and corn for his army, and\r\nsends Mandubratius to them. They speedily performed the things demanded,\r\nand sent hostages to the number appointed, and the corn.\r\n\r\nXXI.--The Trinobantes being protected and secured from any violence of\r\nthe soldiers, the Cenimagni, the Segontiaci, the Ancalites, the Bibroci,\r\nand the Cassi, sending embassies, surrender themselves to Caesar. From\r\nthem he learns that the capital town of Cassivellaunus was not far from\r\nthat place, and was defended by woods and morasses, and a very large\r\nnumber of men and of cattle had been collected in it. (Now the Britons,\r\nwhen they have fortified the intricate woods, in which they are wont to\r\nassemble for the purpose of avoiding the incursion of an enemy, with an\r\nentrenchment and a rampart, call them a town.) Thither he proceeds with\r\nhis legions: he finds the place admirably fortified by nature and art;\r\nhe, however, undertakes to attack it in two directions. The enemy,\r\nhaving remained only a short time, did not sustain the attack of our\r\nsoldiers, and hurried away on the other side of the town. A great amount\r\nof cattle was found there, and many of the enemy were taken and slain in\r\ntheir flight.\r\n\r\nXXII.--While these things are going forward in those places,\r\nCassivellaunus sends messengers into Kent, which, we have observed\r\nabove, is on the sea, over which districts four several kings reigned,\r\nCingetorix, Carvilius, Taximagulus, and Segonax, and commands them to\r\ncollect all their forces, and unexpectedly assail and storm the naval\r\ncamp. When they had come to the camp, our men, after making a sally,\r\nslaying many of their men, and also capturing a distinguished leader\r\nnamed Lugotorix, brought back their own men in safety. Cassivellaunus,\r\nwhen this battle was reported to him, as so many losses had been\r\nsustained, and his territories laid waste, being alarmed most of all by\r\nthe desertion of the states, sends ambassadors to Caesar [to treat]\r\nabout a surrender through the mediation of Commius the Atrebatian.\r\nCaesar, since he had determined to pass the winter on the continent, on\r\naccount of the sudden revolts of Gaul, and as much of the summer did not\r\nremain, and he perceived that even that could be easily protracted,\r\ndemands hostages, and prescribes what tribute Britain should pay each\r\nyear to the Roman people; he forbids and commands Cassivellaunus that he\r\nwage not war against Mandubratius or the Trinobantes.\r\n\r\nXXIII.--When he had received the hostages, he leads back the army to the\r\nsea, and finds the ships repaired. After launching these, because he had\r\na large number of prisoners, and some of the ships had been lost in the\r\nstorm, he determines to convey back his army at two embarkations. And it\r\nso happened, that out of so large a number of ships, in so many voyages,\r\nneither in this nor in the previous year was any ship missing which\r\nconveyed soldiers; but very few out of those which were sent back to him\r\nfrom the continent empty, as the soldiers of the former convoy had been\r\ndisembarked, and out of those (sixty in number) which Labienus had taken\r\ncare to have built, reached their destination; almost all the rest were\r\ndriven back, and when Caesar had waited for them for some time in vain,\r\nlest he should be debarred from a voyage by the season of the year,\r\ninasmuch as the equinox was at hand, he of necessity stowed his soldiers\r\nthe more closely, and, a very great calm coming on, after he had weighed\r\nanchor at the beginning of the second watch, he reached land at break of\r\nday and brought in all the ships in safety.\r\n\r\nXXIV.--The ships having been drawn up and a general assembly of the\r\nGauls held at Samarobriva, because the corn that year had not prospered\r\nin Gaul by reason of the droughts, he was compelled to station his army\r\nin its winter-quarters, differently from the former years, and to\r\ndistribute the legions among several states: one of them he gave to C.\r\nFabius, his lieutenant, to be marched into the territories of the\r\nMorini; a second to Q. Cicero, into those of the Nervii; a third to L.\r\nRoscius, into those of the Essui; a fourth he ordered to winter with T.\r\nLabienus among the Remi in the confines of the Treviri; he stationed\r\nthree in Belgium; over these he appointed M. Crassus, his questor, and\r\nL. Munatius Plancus and C. Trebonius, his lieutenants. One legion which\r\nhe had raised last on the other side of the Po, and five cohorts, he\r\nsent amongst the Eburones, the greatest portion of whom lie between the\r\nMeuse and the Rhine, [and] who were under the government of Ambiorix and\r\nCativolcus. He ordered Q. Titurius Sabinus and L. Aurunculeius Cotta,\r\nhis lieutenants, to take the command of these soldiers. The legions\r\nbeing distributed in this manner, he thought he could most easily remedy\r\nthe scarcity of corn; and yet the winter-quarters of all these legions\r\n(except that which he had given to L. Roscius to be led into the most\r\npeaceful and tranquil neighbourhood) were comprehended within [about]\r\n100 miles. He himself in the meanwhile, until he had stationed the\r\nlegions and knew that the several winter-quarters were fortified,\r\ndetermined to stay in Gaul.\r\n\r\nXXV.--There was among the Carnutes a man named Tasgetius, born of very\r\nhigh rank, whose ancestors had held the sovereignty in his state. To him\r\nCaesar had restored the position of his ancestors, in consideration of\r\nhis prowess and attachment towards him, because in all his wars he had\r\navailed himself of his valuable services. His personal enemies had\r\nkilled him when in the third year of his reign, many even of his own\r\nstate being openly promoters [of that act]. This event is related to\r\nCaesar. He fearing, because several were involved in the act, that the\r\nstate might revolt at their instigation, orders Lucius Plancus, with a\r\nlegion, to proceed quickly from Belgium to the Carnutes, and winter\r\nthere, and arrest and send to him the persons by whose instrumentality\r\nhe should discover that Tasgetius was slain. In the meantime, he was\r\napprised by all the lieutenants and questors to whom he had assigned the\r\nlegions, that they had arrived in winter-quarters, and that the place\r\nfor the quarters was fortified.\r\n\r\nXXVI.--About fifteen days after they had come into winter-quarters, the\r\nbeginning of a sudden insurrection and revolt arose from Ambiorix and\r\nCativolcus, who, though they had met with Sabinus and Cotta at the\r\nborders of their kingdom, and had conveyed corn into our winter-quarters,\r\ninduced by the messages of Indutiomarus, one of the Treviri,\r\nexcited their people, and after having suddenly assailed the soldiers,\r\nengaged in procuring wood, came with a large body to attack the camp.\r\nWhen our men had speedily taken up arms and had ascended the rampart,\r\nand sending out some Spanish horse on one side, had proved conquerors in\r\na cavalry action, the enemy, despairing of success, drew off their\r\ntroops from the assault. Then they shouted, according to their custom,\r\nthat some of our men should go forward to a conference, [alleging] that\r\nthey had some things which they desired to say respecting the common\r\ninterest, by which they trusted their disputes could be removed.\r\n\r\nXXVII.--C. Arpineius, a Roman knight, the intimate friend of Q.\r\nTiturius, and with him Q. Junius, a certain person from Spain, who\r\nalready on previous occasions had been accustomed to go to Ambiorix, at\r\nCaesar's mission, is sent to them for the purpose of a conference:\r\nbefore them Ambiorix spoke to this effect: \"That he confessed that for\r\nCaesar's kindness towards him he was very much indebted to him, inasmuch\r\nas by his aid he had been freed from a tribute which he had been\r\naccustomed to pay to the Aduatuci, his neighbours; and because his own\r\nson and the son of his brother had been sent back to him, whom, when\r\nsent in the number of hostages, the Aduatuci had detained among them in\r\nslavery and in chains; and that he had not done that which he had done\r\nin regard to the attacking of the camp, either by his own judgment or\r\ndesire, but by the compulsion of his state; and that his government was\r\nof that nature, that the people had as much of authority over him as he\r\nover the people. To the state moreover the occasion of the war was this\r\n--that it could not withstand the sudden combination of the Gauls; that\r\nhe could easily prove this from his own weakness, since he was not so\r\nlittle versed in affairs as to presume that with his forces he could\r\nconquer the Roman people; but that it was the common resolution of Gaul;\r\nthat that day was appointed for the storming of all Caesar's\r\nwinter-quarters, in order that no legion should be able to come to the\r\nrelief of another legion, that Gauls could not easily deny Gauls,\r\nespecially when a measure seemed entered into for recovering their common\r\nfreedom. Since he had performed his duty to them on the score of patriotism\r\n[he said], he has now regard to gratitude for the kindness of Caesar; that\r\nhe warned, that he prayed Titurius by the claims of hospitality, to\r\nconsult for his and his soldiers' safety; that a large force of the\r\nGermans had been hired and had passed the Rhine; that it would arrive in\r\ntwo days; that it was for them to consider whether they thought fit,\r\nbefore the nearest people perceived it, to lead off their soldiers when\r\ndrawn out of winter-quarters, either to Cicero or to Labienus; one of\r\nwhom was about fifty miles distant from them, the other rather more;\r\nthat this he promised and confirmed by oath, that he would give them a\r\nsafe passage through his territories; and when he did that, he was both\r\nconsulting for his own state, because it would be relieved from the\r\nwinter-quarters, and also making a requital to Caesar for his\r\nobligations.\"\r\n\r\nXXVIII.--Arpineius and Junius relate to the lieutenants what they had\r\nheard. They, greatly alarmed by the unexpected affair, though those\r\nthings were spoken by an enemy, still thought they were not to be\r\ndisregarded; and they were especially influenced by this consideration,\r\nthat it was scarcely credible that the obscure and humble state of the\r\nEburones had dared to make war upon the Roman people of their own\r\naccord. Accordingly, they refer the matter to a council, and a, great\r\ncontroversy arises among them. L. Aurunculeius, and several tribunes of\r\nthe soldiers and the centurions of the first rank, were of opinion \"that\r\nnothing should be done hastily, and that they should not depart from the\r\ncamp without Caesar's orders\"; they declared, \"that any forces of the\r\nGermans, however great, might be encountered by fortified winter-quarters;\r\nthat this fact was a proof [of it]; that they had sustained the first\r\nassault of the Germans most valiantly, inflicting many wounds upon them;\r\nthat they were not distressed for corn; that in the meantime relief\r\nwould come both from the nearest winter-quarters and from Caesar\"; lastly,\r\nthey put the query, \"what could be more undetermined, more undignified,\r\nthan to adopt measures respecting the most important affairs on the\r\nauthority of an enemy?\"\r\n\r\nXXIX.--In opposition to those things Titurius exclaimed, \"That they\r\nwould do this too late, when greater forces of the enemy, after a\r\njunction with the Germans, should have assembled; or when some disaster\r\nhad been received in the neighbouring winter-quarters; that the\r\nopportunity for deliberating was short; that he believed that Caesar had\r\nset forth into Italy, as the Carnutes would not otherwise have taken the\r\nmeasure of slaying Tasgetius, nor would the Eburones, if he had been\r\npresent, have come to the camp with so great defiance of us; that he did\r\nnot regard the enemy, but the fact, as the authority; that the Rhine was\r\nnear; that the death of Ariovistus and our previous victories were\r\nsubjects of great indignation to the Germans; that Gaul was inflamed,\r\nthat after having received so many defeats she was reduced under the\r\nsway of the Roman people, her pristine glory in military matters being\r\nextinguished.\" Lastly, \"who would persuade himself of this, that\r\nAmbiorix had resorted to a design of that nature without sure grounds?\r\nThat his own opinion was safe on either side; if there be nothing very\r\nformidable, they would go without danger to the nearest legion; if all\r\nGaul conspired with the Germans, their only safety lay in despatch. What\r\nissue would the advice of Cotta and of those who differed from him,\r\nhave? from which, if immediate danger was not to be dreaded, yet\r\ncertainly famine, by a protracted siege, was.\"\r\n\r\nXXX.--This discussion having been held on the two sides, when opposition\r\nwas offered strenuously by Cotta and the principal officers, \"Prevail,\"\r\nsaid Sabinus, \"if so you wish it\"; and he said it with a louder voice,\r\nthat a great portion of the soldiers might hear him; \"nor am I the\r\nperson among you,\" he said, \"who is most powerfully alarmed by the\r\ndanger of death; these will be aware of it, and then, if any thing\r\ndisastrous shall have occurred, they will demand a reckoning at your\r\nhands; these, who, if it were permitted by you, united three days hence\r\nwith the nearest winter-quarters, may encounter the common condition of\r\nwar with the rest, and not, as if forced away and separated far from the\r\nrest, perish either by the sword or by famine.\"\r\n\r\nXXXI.--They rise from the council, detain both, and entreat, that \"they\r\ndo not bring the matter into the greatest jeopardy by their dissension\r\nand obstinacy; the affair was an easy one, if only they all thought and\r\napproved of the same thing, whether they remain or depart; on the other\r\nhand, they saw no security in dissension.\" The matter is prolonged by\r\ndebate till midnight. At last Cotta, being overruled, yields his assent;\r\nthe opinion of Sabinus prevails. It is proclaimed that they will march\r\nat day-break; the remainder of the night is spent without sleep, since\r\nevery soldier was inspecting his property, [to see] what he could carry\r\nwith him, and what, out of the appurtenances of the winter-quarters, he\r\nwould be compelled to leave; every reason is suggested to show why they\r\ncould not stay without danger, and how that danger would be increased by\r\nthe fatigue of the soldiers and their want of sleep. At break of day\r\nthey quit the camp, in a very extended line and with a very large amount\r\nof baggage, in such a manner as men who were convinced that the advice\r\nwas given by Ambiorix, not as an enemy, but as most friendly [towards\r\nthem].\r\n\r\nXXXII.--But the enemy, after they had made the discovery of their\r\nintended departure by the noise during the night and their not retiring\r\nto rest, having placed an ambuscade in two divisions in the woods, in a\r\nsuitable and concealed place, two miles from the camp, waited for the\r\narrival of the Romans; and when the greater part of the line of march\r\nhad descended into a considerable valley, they suddenly presented\r\nthemselves on either side of that valley, and began both to harass the\r\nrear and hinder the van from ascending, and to give battle in a place\r\nexceedingly disadvantageous to our men.\r\n\r\nXXXIII.--Then at length Titurius, as one who had provided nothing\r\nbeforehand, was confused, ran to and fro, and set about arranging his\r\ntroops; these very things, however, he did timidly and in such a manner\r\nthat all resources seemed to fail him: which generally happens to those\r\nwho are compelled to take council in the action itself. But Cotta, who\r\nhad reflected that these things might occur on the march, and on that\r\naccount had not been an adviser of the departure, was wanting to the\r\ncommon safety in no respect; both in addressing and encouraging the\r\nsoldiers, he performed the duties of a general, and in the battle those\r\nof a soldier. And since they [Titurius and Cotta] could less easily\r\nperform everything by themselves, and provide what was to be done in\r\neach place, by reason of the length of the line of march, they ordered\r\n[the officers] to give the command that they should leave the baggage\r\nand form themselves into an orb, which measure, though in a contingency\r\nof that nature it was not to be condemned, still turned out\r\nunfortunately; for it both diminished the hope of our soldiers and\r\nrendered the enemy more eager for the fight, because it appeared that\r\nthis was not done without the greatest fear and despair. Besides that\r\nhappened, which would necessarily be the case, that the soldiers for the\r\nmost part quitted their ensigns and hurried to seek and carry off from\r\nthe baggage whatever each thought valuable, and all parts were filled\r\nwith uproar and lamentation.\r\n\r\nXXXIV.--But judgment was not wanting to the barbarians; for their\r\nleaders ordered [the officers] to proclaim through the ranks \"that no\r\nman should quit his place; that the booty was theirs, and for them was\r\nreserved whatever the Romans should leave; therefore let them consider\r\nthat all things depended on their victory.\" Our men were equal to them\r\nin fighting, both in courage and in number, and though they were\r\ndeserted by their leader and by fortune, yet they still placed all hope\r\nof safety in their valour, and as often as any cohort sallied forth on\r\nthat side, a great number of the enemy usually fell. Ambiorix, when he\r\nobserved this, orders the command to be issued that they throw their\r\nweapons from a distance and do not approach too near, and in whatever\r\ndirection the Romans should make an attack, there give way (from the\r\nlightness of their appointments and from their daily practice no damage\r\ncould be done them); [but] pursue them when betaking themselves to their\r\nstandards again.\r\n\r\nXXXV.--Which command having been most carefully obeyed, when any cohort\r\nhad quitted the circle and made a charge, the enemy fled very\r\nprecipitately. In the meantime, that part of the Roman army, of\r\nnecessity, was left unprotected, and the weapons received on their open\r\nflank. Again, when they had begun to return to that place from which\r\nthey had advanced, they were surrounded both by those who had retreated\r\nand by those who stood next them; but if, on the other hand, they wished\r\nto keep their place, neither was an opportunity left for valour, nor\r\ncould they, being crowded together, escape the weapons cast by so large\r\na body of men. Yet, though assailed by so many disadvantages, [and]\r\nhaving received many wounds, they withstood the enemy, and, a great\r\nportion of the day being spent, though they fought from day-break till\r\nthe eighth hour, they did nothing which was unworthy of them. At length,\r\neach thigh of T. Balventius, who the year before had been chief\r\ncenturion, a brave man and one of great authority, is pierced with a\r\njavelin; Q. Lucanius, of the same rank, fighting most valiantly, is\r\nslain while he assists his son when surrounded by the enemy; L. Cotta,\r\nthe lieutenant, when encouraging all the cohorts and companies, is\r\nwounded full in the mouth by a sling.\r\n\r\nXXXVI.--Much troubled by these events, Q. Titurius, when he had\r\nperceived Ambiorix in the distance encouraging his men, sends to him his\r\ninterpreter, Cn. Pompey, to beg that he would spare him and his\r\nsoldiers. He, when addressed, replied, \"If he wished to confer with him,\r\nit was permitted; that he hoped what pertained to the safety of the\r\nsoldiers could be obtained from the people; that to him however\r\ncertainly no injury would be done, and that he pledged his faith to that\r\neffect.\" He consults with Cotta, who had been wounded, whether it would\r\nappear right to retire from battle, and confer with Ambiorix; [saying]\r\nthat he hoped to be able to succeed respecting his own and the soldiers'\r\nsafety. Cotta says he will not go to an armed enemy, and in that\r\nperseveres.\r\n\r\nXXXVII.--Sabinus orders those tribunes of the soldiers whom he had at\r\nthe time around him, and the centurions of the first ranks, to follow\r\nhim, and when he had approached near to Ambiorix, being ordered to throw\r\ndown his arms, he obeys the order and commands his men to do the same.\r\nIn the meantime, while they treat upon the terms, and a longer debate\r\nthan necessary is designedly entered into by Ambiorix, being surrounded\r\nby degrees, he is slain. Then they according to their custom shout out\r\n\"Victory,\" and raise their war-cry, and, making an attack on our men,\r\nbreak their ranks. There L. Cotta, while fighting, is slain, together\r\nwith the greater part of the soldiers; the rest betake themselves to the\r\ncamp from which they had marched forth, and one of them, L. Petrosidius,\r\nthe standard bearer, when he was overpowered by the great number of the\r\nenemy, threw the eagle within the entrenchments and is himself slain\r\nwhile fighting with the greatest courage before the camp. They with\r\ndifficulty sustain the attack till night; despairing of safety, they all\r\nto a man destroy themselves in the night. A few escaping from the\r\nbattle, make their way to Labienus at winter-quarters, after wandering\r\nat random through the woods, and inform him of these events.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII.--Elated by this victory, Ambiorix marches immediately with his\r\ncavalry to the Aduatuci, who bordered on his kingdom; he halts neither\r\nday nor night, and orders the infantry to follow him closely. Having\r\nrelated the exploit and roused the Aduatuci, the next day he arrived\r\namong the Nervii, and entreats \"that they should not throw away the\r\nopportunity of liberating themselves for ever and of punishing the\r\nRomans for those wrongs which they had received from them\"; [he tells\r\nthem] \"that two lieutenants have been slain, and that a large portion of\r\nthe army has perished; that it was not a matter of difficulty for the\r\nlegion which was wintering with Cicero to be cut off, when suddenly\r\nassaulted; he declares himself ready to co-operate in that design.\" He\r\neasily gains over the Nervii by this speech.\r\n\r\nXXXIX.--Accordingly, messengers having been forthwith despatched to the\r\nCentrones, the Grudii, the Levaci, the Pleumoxii, and the Geiduni, all\r\nof whom are under their government, they assemble as large bodies as\r\nthey can, and rush unexpectedly to the winter-quarters of Cicero, the\r\nreport of the death of Titurius not having as yet been conveyed to him.\r\nThat also occurred to him which was the consequence of a necessary\r\nwork,--that some soldiers who had gone off into the woods for the\r\npurpose of procuring timber and therewith constructing fortifications,\r\nwere intercepted by the sudden arrival of [the enemy's] horse. These\r\nhaving been entrapped, the Eburones, the Nervii, and the Aduatuci and\r\nall their allies and dependants, begin to attack the legion: our men\r\nquickly run together to arms and mount the rampart: they sustained the\r\nattack that day with great difficulty, since the enemy placed all their\r\nhope in despatch, and felt assured that, if they obtained this victory,\r\nthey would be conquerors for ever.\r\n\r\nXL.--Letters are immediately sent to Caesar by Cicero, great rewards\r\nbeing offered [to the messengers] if they carried them through. All the\r\npasses having been beset, those who were sent are intercepted. During\r\nthe night as many as 120 towers are raised with incredible despatch out\r\nof the timber which they had collected for the purpose of fortification:\r\nthe things which seemed necessary to the work are completed. The\r\nfollowing day the enemy, having collected far greater forces, attack the\r\ncamp [and] fill up the ditch. Resistance is made by our men in the same\r\nmanner as the day before: this same thing is done afterwards during the\r\nremaining days. The work is carried on incessantly in the night: not\r\neven to the sick, or wounded, is opportunity given for rest: whatever\r\nthings are required for resisting the assault of the next day are\r\nprovided during the night: many stakes burnt at the end, and a large\r\nnumber of mural pikes are procured: towers are built up, battlements and\r\nparapets are formed of interwoven hurdles. Cicero himself, though he was\r\nin very weak health, did not leave himself the night-time for repose, so\r\nthat he was forced to spare himself by the spontaneous movement and\r\nentreaties of the soldiers.\r\n\r\nXLI.--Then these leaders and chiefs of the Nervii, who had any intimacy\r\nand grounds of friendship with Cicero, say they desire to confer with\r\nhim. When permission was granted, they recount the same things which\r\nAmbiorix had related to Titurius, namely, \"that all Gaul was in arms,\r\nthat the Germans had passed the Rhine, that the winter-quarters of\r\nCaesar and of the others were attacked.\" They report in addition also,\r\nabout the death of Sabinus. They point to Ambiorix for the purpose of\r\nobtaining credence; \"they are mistaken,\" say they, \"if they hoped for\r\nany relief from those who distrust their own affairs; that they bear\r\nsuch feelings towards Cicero and the Roman people that they deny them\r\nnothing but winter-quarters and are unwilling that this practice should\r\nbecome constant; that through their [the Nervii's] means it is possible\r\nfor them [the Romans] to depart from their winter-quarters safely and to\r\nproceed without fear into whatever parts they desire.\" To these Cicero\r\nmade only one reply: \"that it is not the custom of the Roman people to\r\naccept any condition from an armed enemy: if they are willing to lay\r\ndown their arms, they may employ him as their advocate and send\r\nambassadors to Caesar: that he believed, from his [Caesar's] justice,\r\nthey would obtain the things which they might request.\"\r\n\r\nXLII.--Disappointed in this hope, the Nervii surround the winter-quarters\r\nwith a rampart eleven feet high, and a ditch thirteen feet in\r\ndepth. These military works they had learnt from our men in the\r\nintercourse of former years, and, having taken some of our army\r\nprisoners, were instructed by them: but, as they had no supply of iron\r\ntools which are requisite for this service, they were forced to cut the\r\nturf with their swords, and to empty out the earth with their hands and\r\ncloaks, from which circumstance the vast number of the men could be\r\ninferred; for in less than three hours they completed a fortification of\r\nten miles in circumference; and during the rest of the days they began\r\nto prepare and construct towers of the height of the ramparts, and\r\ngrappling irons, and mantlets, which the same prisoners had taught them.\r\n\r\nXLIII.--On the seventh day of the attack, a very high wind having sprung\r\nup, they began to discharge by their slings hot balls made of burnt or\r\nhardened clay, and heated javelins, upon the huts, which, after the\r\nGallic custom, were thatched with straw. These quickly took fire, and by\r\nthe violence of the wind, scattered their flames in every part of the\r\ncamp. The enemy following up their success with a very loud shout, as if\r\nvictory were already obtained and secured, began to advance their towers\r\nand mantlets, and climb the rampart with ladders. But so great was the\r\ncourage of our soldiers, and such their presence of mind, that though\r\nthey were scorched on all sides, and harassed by a vast number of\r\nweapons, and were aware that their baggage and their possessions were\r\nburning, not only did no one quit the rampart for the purpose of\r\nwithdrawing from the scene, but scarcely did any one even then look\r\nbehind; and they all fought most vigorously and most valiantly. This day\r\nwas by far the most calamitous to our men; it had this result, however,\r\nthat on that day the largest number of the enemy was wounded and slain,\r\nsince they had crowded beneath the very rampart, and the hindmost did\r\nnot afford the foremost a retreat. The flame having abated a little, and\r\na tower having been brought up in a particular place and touching the\r\nrampart, the centurions of the third cohort retired from the place in\r\nwhich they were standing, and drew off all their men: they began to call\r\non the enemy by gestures and by words, to enter if they wished; but none\r\nof them dared to advance. Then stones having been cast from every\r\nquarter, the enemy were dislodged, and their tower set on fire.\r\n\r\nXLIV.--In that legion there were two very brave men, centurions, who\r\nwere now approaching the first ranks, T. Pulfio, and L. Varenus. These\r\nused to have continual disputes between them which of them should be\r\npreferred, and every year used to contend for promotion with the utmost\r\nanimosity. When the fight was going on most vigorously before the\r\nfortifications, Pulfio, one of them, says, \"Why do you hesitate,\r\nVarenus? or what [better] opportunity of signalising your valour do you\r\nseek? This very day shall decide our disputes.\" When he had uttered\r\nthese words, he proceeds beyond the fortifications, and rushes on that\r\npart of the enemy which appeared the thickest. Nor does Varenus remain\r\nwithin the rampart, but respecting the high opinion of all, follows\r\nclose after. Then, when an inconsiderable space intervened, Pulfio\r\nthrows his javelin at the enemy, and pierces one of the multitude who\r\nwas running up, and while the latter was wounded and slain, the enemy\r\ncover him with their shields, and all throw their weapons at the other\r\nand afford him no opportunity of retreating. The shield of Pulfio is\r\npierced and a javelin is fastened in his belt. This circumstance turns\r\naside his scabbard and obstructs his right hand when attempting to draw\r\nhis sword: the enemy crowd around him when [thus] embarrassed. His rival\r\nruns up to him and succours him in this emergency. Immediately the whole\r\nhost turn from Pulfio to him, supposing the other to be pierced through\r\nby the javelin. Varenus rushes on briskly with his sword and carries on\r\nthe combat hand to hand, and having slain one man, for a short time\r\ndrove back the rest: while he urges on too eagerly, slipping into a\r\nhollow, he fell. To him, in his turn, when surrounded, Pulfio brings\r\nrelief; and both having slain a great number, retreat into the\r\nfortifications amidst the highest applause. Fortune so dealt with both\r\nin this rivalry and conflict, that the one competitor was a succour and\r\na safeguard to the other, nor could it be determined which of the two\r\nappeared worthy of being preferred to the other.\r\n\r\nXLV.--In proportion as the attack became daily more formidable and\r\nviolent, and particularly because, as a great number of the soldiers\r\nwere exhausted with wounds, the matter had come to a small number of\r\ndefenders, more frequent letters and messengers were sent to Caesar; a\r\npart of which messengers were taken and tortured to death in the sight\r\nof our soldiers. There was within our camp a certain Nervian, by name\r\nVertico, born in a distinguished position, who in the beginning of the\r\nblockade had deserted to Cicero, and had exhibited his fidelity to him.\r\nHe persuades his slave, by the hope of freedom, and by great rewards, to\r\nconvey a letter to Caesar. This he carries out bound about his javelin,\r\nand mixing among the Gauls without any suspicion by being a Gaul, he\r\nreaches Caesar. From him they received information of the imminent\r\ndanger of Cicero and the legion.\r\n\r\nXLVI.--Caesar having received the letter about the eleventh hour of the\r\nday, immediately sends a messenger to the Bellovaci, to M. Crassus,\r\nquestor there, whose winter-quarters were twenty-five miles distant from\r\nhim. He orders the legion to set forward in the middle of the night and\r\ncome to him with despatch. Crassus set out with the messenger. He sends\r\nanther to C. Fabius, the lieutenant, ordering him to lead forth his\r\nlegion into the territories of the Atrebates, to which he knew his march\r\nmust be made. He writes to Labienus to come with his legion to the\r\nfrontiers of the Nervii, if he could do so to the advantage of the\r\ncommonwealth: he does not consider that the remaining portion of the\r\narmy, because it was somewhat farther distant, should be waited for; but\r\nassembles about 400 horse from the nearest winter-quarters.\r\n\r\nXLVII.--Having been apprised of the arrival of Crassus by the scouts at\r\nabout the third hour, he advances twenty miles that day. He appoints\r\nCrassus over Samarobriva and assigns him a legion, because he was\r\nleaving there the baggage of the army, the hostages of the states, the\r\npublic documents, and all the corn, which he had conveyed thither for\r\npassing the winter. Fabius, without delaying a moment, meets him on the\r\nmarch with his legion, as he had been commanded. Labienus, having learnt\r\nthe death of Sabinus and the destruction of the cohorts, as all the\r\nforces of the Treviri had come against him, beginning to fear lest, if\r\nhe made a departure from his winter-quarters, resembling a flight, he\r\nshould not be able to support the attack of the enemy, particularly\r\nsince he knew them to be elated by their recent victory, sends back a\r\nletter to Caesar, informing him with what great hazard he would lead out\r\nhis legion from winter-quarters; he relates at large the affair which\r\nhad taken place among the Eburones; he informs him that all the infantry\r\nand cavalry of the Treviri had encamped at a distance of only three\r\nmiles from his own camp.\r\n\r\nXLVIII.--Caesar, approving of his motives, although he was disappointed\r\nin his expectation of three legions, and reduced to two, yet placed his\r\nonly hopes of the common safety in despatch. He goes into the\r\nterritories of the Nervii by long marches. There he learns from some\r\nprisoners what things are going on in the camp of Cicero, and in how\r\ngreat jeopardy the affair is. Then with great rewards he induces a\r\ncertain man of the Gallic horse to convey a letter to Cicero. This he\r\nsends written in Greek characters, lest the letter being intercepted,\r\nour measures should be discovered by the enemy. He directs him, if he\r\nshould be unable to enter, to throw his spear with the letter fastened\r\nto the thong inside the fortifications of the camp. He writes in the\r\nletter, that he having set out with his legions, will quickly be there:\r\nhe entreats him to maintain his ancient valour. The Gaul apprehending\r\ndanger, throws his spear as he had been directed. It by chance stuck in\r\na tower, and, not being observed by our men for two days, was seen by a\r\ncertain soldier on the third day: when taken down, it was carried to\r\nCicero. He, after perusing it, reads it out in an assembly of the\r\nsoldiers, and fills all with the greatest joy. Then the smoke of the\r\nfires was seen in the distance, a circumstance which banished all doubt\r\nof the arrival of the legions.\r\n\r\nXLIX.--The Gauls, having discovered the matter through their scouts,\r\nabandon the blockade, and march towards Caesar with all their forces:\r\nthese were about 60,000 armed men. Cicero, an opportunity being now\r\nafforded, again begs of that Vertico, the Gaul, whom we mentioned above,\r\nto convey back a letter to Caesar; he advises him to perform his journey\r\nwarily; he writes in the letter that the enemy had departed and had\r\nturned their entire force against him. When this letter was brought to\r\nhim about the middle of the night, Caesar apprises his soldiers of its\r\ncontents, and inspires them with courage for fighting: the following\r\nday, at the dawn, he moves his camp, and, having proceeded four miles,\r\nhe espies the forces of the enemy on the other side of a considerable\r\nvalley and rivulet. It was an affair of great danger to fight with such\r\nlarge forces in a disadvantageous situation. For the present, therefore,\r\ninasmuch as he knew that Cicero was released from the blockade, and\r\nthought that he might, on that account, relax his speed, he halted there\r\nand fortifies a camp in the most favourable position he can. And this,\r\nthough it was small in itself, [there being] scarcely 7000 men, and\r\nthese too without baggage, still by the narrowness of the passages, he\r\ncontracts as much as he can, with this object, that he may come into the\r\ngreatest contempt with the enemy. In the meanwhile, scouts having been\r\nsent in all directions, he examines by what most convenient path he\r\nmight cross the valley.\r\n\r\nL.--That day, slight skirmishes of cavalry having taken place near the\r\nriver, both armies kept in their own positions: the Gauls, because they\r\nwere awaiting larger forces which had not then arrived; Caesar, [to see]\r\nif perchance by pretence of fear he could allure the enemy towards his\r\nposition, so that he might engage in battle, in front of his camp, on\r\nthis side of the valley; if he could not accomplish this, that, having\r\ninquired about the passes, he might cross the valley and the river with\r\nthe less hazard. At day-break the cavalry of the enemy approaches to the\r\ncamp and joins battle with our horse. Caesar orders the horse to give\r\nway purposely, and retreat to the camp: at the same time he orders the\r\ncamp to be fortified with a higher rampart in all directions, the gates\r\nto be barricaded, and in executing these things as much confusion to be\r\nshown as possible, and to perform them under the pretence of fear.\r\n\r\nLI.--Induced by all these things the enemy lead over their forces and\r\ndraw up their line in a disadvantageous position; and as our men also\r\nhad been led down from the ramparts, they approach nearer, and throw\r\ntheir weapons into the fortification from all sides, and sending heralds\r\nround, order it to be proclaimed that, if \"any, either Gaul or Roman,\r\nwas willing to go over to them before the third hour, it was permitted;\r\nafter that time there would not be permission\"; and so much did they\r\ndisregard our men, that the gates having been blocked up with single\r\nrows of turf as a mere appearance, because they did not seem able to\r\nburst in that way, some began to pull down the rampart with their hands,\r\nothers to fill up the trenches. Then Caesar, making a sally from all the\r\ngates, and sending out the cavalry, soon puts the enemy to flight, so\r\nthat no one at all stood his ground with the intention of fighting; and\r\nhe slew a great number of them, and deprived all of their arms.\r\n\r\nLII.--Caesar, fearing to pursue them very far, because woods and\r\nmorasses intervened, and also [because] he saw that they suffered no\r\nsmall loss in abandoning their position, reaches Cicero the same day\r\nwith all his forces safe. He witnesses with surprise the towers,\r\nmantlets, and [other] fortifications belonging to the enemy: the legion\r\nhaving been drawn out, he finds that even every tenth soldier had not\r\nescaped without wounds. From all these things he judges with what danger\r\nand with what great courage matters had been conducted; he commends\r\nCicero according to his desert and likewise the legion; he addresses\r\nindividually the centurions and the tribunes of the soldiers, whose\r\nvalour he had discovered to have been signal. He receives information of\r\nthe death of Sabinus and Cotta from the prisoners. An assembly being\r\nheld the following day, he states the occurrence; he consoles and\r\nencourages the soldiers; he suggests that the disaster, which had been\r\noccasioned by the misconduct and rashness of his lieutenant, should be\r\nborne with a patient mind, because by the favour of the immortal gods\r\nand their own valour, neither was lasting joy left to the enemy, nor\r\nvery lasting grief to them.\r\n\r\nLIII.--In the meanwhile the report respecting the victory of Caesar is\r\nconveyed to Labienus through the country of the Remi with incredible\r\nspeed, so that, though he was about sixty miles distant from the\r\nwinter-quarter of Cicero, and Caesar had arrived there after the ninth\r\nhour, before midnight a shout arose at the gates of the camp, by which\r\nshout an indication of the victory and a congratulation on the part of\r\nthe Remi were given to Labienus. This report having been carried to the\r\nTreviri, Indutiormarus, who had resolved to attack the camp of Labienus\r\nthe following day, flies by night and leads back all his forces into the\r\ncountry of the Treviri. Caesar sends back Fabius with his legion to his\r\nwinter-quarters; he himself determines to winter with three legions near\r\nSamarobriva in three different quarters, and, because such great\r\ncommotions had arisen in Gaul, he resolved to remain during the whole\r\nwinter with the army himself. For the disaster respecting the death of\r\nSabinus having been circulated among them, almost all the states of Gaul\r\nwere deliberating about war, sending messengers and embassies into all\r\nquarters, inquiring what further measure they should take, and holding\r\ncouncils by night in secluded places. Nor did any period of the whole\r\nwinter pass over without fresh anxiety to Caesar, or without his\r\nreceiving some intelligence respecting the meetings and commotions of\r\nthe Gauls. Among these, he is informed by L. Roscius, the lieutenant\r\nwhom he had placed over the thirteenth legion, that large forces of\r\nthose states of the Gauls, which are called the Armoricae, had assembled\r\nfor the purpose of attacking him and were not more than eight miles\r\ndistant; but intelligence respecting the victory of Caesar being carried\r\n[to them], had retreated in such a manner that their departure appeared\r\nlike a flight.\r\n\r\nLIV.--But Caesar, having summoned to him the principal persons of each\r\nstate, in one case by alarming them, since he declared that he knew what\r\nwas going on, and in another case by encouraging them, retained a great\r\npart of Gaul in its allegiance. The Senones, however, which is a state\r\neminently powerful and one of great influence among the Gauls,\r\nattempting by general design to slay Cavarinus whom Caesar had created\r\nking among them (whose brother, Moritasgus, had held the sovereignty at\r\nthe period of the arrival of Caesar in Gaul, and whose ancestors had\r\nalso previously held it) when he discovered their plot and fled, pursued\r\nhim even to the frontiers [of the state], and drove him from his kingdom\r\nand his home; and, after having sent ambassadors to Caesar for the\r\npurpose of concluding a peace, when he ordered all their senate to come\r\nto him, did not obey that command. So far did it operate among those\r\nbarbarian people, that there were found some to be the first to wage\r\nwar; and so great a change of inclinations did it produce in all, that\r\nexcept the Aedui and the Remi, whom Caesar had always held in especial\r\nhonour, the one people for their long standing and uniform fidelity\r\ntowards the Roman people, the other for their late service in the Gallic\r\nwar, there was scarcely a state which was not suspected by us. And I do\r\nnot know whether that ought much to be wondered at, as well for several\r\nother reasons, as particularly because they who ranked above all nations\r\nfor prowess in war, most keenly regretted that they had lost so much of\r\nthat reputation as to submit to commands from the Roman people.\r\n\r\nLV.--But the Treviri and Indutiomarus let no part of the entire winter\r\npass without sending ambassadors across the Rhine, importuning the\r\nstates, promising money, and asserting that, as a large portion of our\r\narmy had been cut off, a much smaller portion remained. However, none of\r\nthe German states could be induced to cross the Rhine, since \"they had\r\ntwice essayed it,\" they said, \"in the war with Ariovistus and in the\r\npassage of the Tenchtheri there; that fortune was not to be tempted any\r\nmore.\" Indutiomarus disappointed in this expectation, nevertheless began\r\nto raise troops, and discipline them, and procure horses from the\r\nneighbouring people and allure to him by great rewards the outlaws and\r\nconvicts throughout Gaul. And such great influence had he already\r\nacquired for himself in Gaul by these means, that embassies were\r\nflocking to him in all directions, and seeking, publicly and privately,\r\nhis favour and friendship.\r\n\r\nLVI.--When he perceived that they were coming to him voluntarily; that\r\non the one side the Senones and the Carnutes were stimulated by their\r\nconsciousness of guilt, on the other side the Nervii and the Aduatuci\r\nwere preparing war against the Romans, and that forces of volunteers\r\nwould not be wanting to him if he began to advance from his own\r\nterritories, he proclaims an armed council (this according to the custom\r\nof the Gauls is the commencement of war) at which, by a common law, all\r\nthe youth were wont to assemble in arms; whoever of them comes last is\r\nkilled in the sight of the whole assembly after being racked with every\r\ntorture. In that council he declares Cingetorix, the leader of the other\r\nfaction, his own son-in-law (whom we have above mentioned, as having\r\nembraced the protection of Caesar, and never having deserted him) an\r\nenemy and confiscates his property. When these things were finished, he\r\nasserts in the council that he, invited by the Senones and the Carnutes,\r\nand several other states of Gaul, was about to march thither through the\r\nterritories of the Remi, devastate their lands, and attack the camp of\r\nLabienus: before he does that, he informs them of what he desires to be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nLVII.--Labienus, since he was confining himself within a camp strongly\r\nfortified by the nature of the ground and by art, had no apprehensions\r\nas to his own and the legion's danger, but was devising that he might\r\nthrow away no opportunity of conducting the war successfully.\r\nAccordingly, the speech of Indutiomarus, which he had delivered in the\r\ncouncil, having been made known [to him] by Cingetorix and his allies,\r\nhe sends messengers to the neighbouring states and summons horse from\r\nall quarters: he appoints to them a fixed day for assembling. In the\r\nmeantime, Indutiomarus, with all his cavalry, nearly every day used to\r\nparade close to his [Labienus's] camp; at one time, that he might inform\r\nhimself of the situation of the camp; at another time, for the purpose\r\nof conferring with or of intimidating him. Labienus confined his men\r\nwithin the fortifications and promoted the enemy's belief of his fear by\r\nwhatever methods he could.\r\n\r\nLVIII.--Since Indutiomarus was daily advancing up to the camp with\r\ngreater defiance, all the cavalry of the neighbouring states which he\r\n[Labienus] had taken care to have sent for, having been admitted in one\r\nnight, he confined all his men within the camp by guards with such great\r\nstrictness, that that fact could by no means be reported or carried to\r\nthe Treviri. In the meanwhile Indutiomarus, according to his daily\r\npractice, advances up to the camp and spends a great part of the day\r\nthere: his horse cast their weapons, and with very insulting language\r\ncall out our men to battle. No reply being given by our men, the enemy\r\nwhen they thought proper, depart towards evening in a disorderly and\r\nscattered manner, Labienus unexpectedly sends out all the cavalry by two\r\ngates; he gives this command and prohibition, that, when the enemy\r\nshould be terrified and put to flight (which he foresaw would happen, as\r\nit did), they should all make for Indutiomarus, and no one wound any man\r\nbefore he should have seen him slain, because he was unwilling that he\r\nshould escape, in consequence of gaining time by the delay [occasioned\r\nby the pursuit] of the rest. He offers great rewards for those who\r\nshould kill him: he sends up the cohorts as a relief to the horse. The\r\nissue justifies the policy of the man, and, since all aimed at one,\r\nIndutiomarus is slain, having been overtaken at the very ford of the\r\nriver, and his head is carried to the camp: the horse, when returning,\r\npursue and slay all whom they can. This affair having been known, all\r\nthe forces of the Eburones and the Nervii which had assembled, depart;\r\nand for a short time after this action, Caesar was less harassed in the\r\ngovernment of Gaul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI\r\n\r\nI.--Caesar, expecting for many reasons a greater commotion in Gaul,\r\nresolves to hold a levy by the means of M. Silanus, C. Antistius\r\nReginus, and T. Sextius, his lieutenants: at the same time he requested\r\nof Cn. Pompey, the proconsul, that since he was remaining near the city\r\ninvested with military command for the interests of the commonwealth, he\r\nwould command those men whom when consul he had levied by the military\r\noath in Cisalpine Gaul, to join their respective corps, and to proceed\r\nto him; thinking it of great importance, as far as regarded the opinion\r\nwhich the Gauls would entertain for the future, that the resources of\r\nItaly should appear so great, that if any loss should be sustained in\r\nwar, not only could it be repaired in a short time, but likewise be\r\nfurther supplied by still larger forces. And when Pompey had granted\r\nthis to the interests of the commonwealth and the claims of friendship,\r\nCaesar having quickly completed the levy by means of his lieutenants,\r\nafter three legions had been both formed and brought to him before the\r\nwinter [had] expired, and the number of those cohorts which he had lost\r\nunder Q. Titurius had been doubled, taught the Gauls, both by his\r\ndispatch and by his forces, what the discipline and the power of the\r\nRoman people could accomplish.\r\n\r\nII.--Indutiomarus having been slain, as we have stated, the government\r\nwas conferred upon his relatives by the Treviri. They cease not to\r\nimportune the neighbouring Germans and to promise them money: when they\r\ncould not obtain [their object] from those nearest them, they try those\r\nmore remote. Having found some states willing to accede to their wishes,\r\nthey enter into a compact with them by a mutual oath, and give hostages\r\nas a security for the money: they attach Ambiorix to them by an alliance\r\nand confederacy. Caesar, on being informed of their acts, since he saw\r\nthat war was being prepared on all sides, that the Nervii, Aduatuci, and\r\nMenapii, with the addition of all the Germans on this side of the Rhine\r\nwere under arms, that the Senones did not assemble according to his\r\ncommand, and were concerting measures with the Carnutes and the\r\nneighbouring states, that the Germans were importuned by the Treviri in\r\nfrequent embassies, thought that he ought to take measures for the war\r\nearlier [than usual].\r\n\r\nIII.-Accordingly, while the winter was not yet ended, having\r\nconcentrated the four nearest legions, he marched unexpectedly into the\r\nterritories of the Nervii, and before they could either assemble, or\r\nretreat, after capturing a large number of cattle and of men, and\r\nwasting their lands and giving up that booty to the soldiers, compelled\r\nthem to enter into a surrender and give him hostages. That business\r\nhaving been speedily executed, he again led his legions back into\r\nwinter-quarters. Having proclaimed a council of Gaul in the beginning of\r\nthe spring, as he had been accustomed [to do], when the deputies from\r\nthe rest, except the Senones, the Carnutes, and the Treviri, had come,\r\njudging this to be the commencement of war and revolt, that he might\r\nappear to consider all things of less consequence [than that war], he\r\ntransfers the council to Lutetia of the Parisii. These were adjacent to\r\nthe Senones, and had united their state to them during the memory of\r\ntheir fathers, but were thought to have no part in the present plot.\r\nHaving proclaimed this from the tribunal, he advances the same day\r\ntowards the Senones with his legions and arrives among them by long\r\nmarches.\r\n\r\nIV.--Acco, who had been the author of that enterprise, on being informed\r\nof his arrival, orders the people to assemble in the towns; to them,\r\nwhile attempting this and before it could be accomplished, news is\r\nbrought that the Romans are close at hand: through necessity they give\r\nover their design and send ambassadors to Caesar for the purpose of\r\nimploring pardon; they make advances to him through the Aedui, whose\r\nstate was from ancient times under the protection of Rome. Caesar\r\nreadily grants them pardon and receives their excuse at the request of\r\nthe Aedui; because he thought that the summer season was one for an\r\nimpending war, not for an investigation. Having imposed one hundred\r\nhostages, he delivers these to the Aedui to be held in charge by them.\r\nTo the same place the Carnutes send ambassadors and hostages, employing\r\nas their mediators the Remi, under whose protection they were: they\r\nreceive the same answers. Caesar concludes the council and imposes a\r\nlevy of cavalry on the states.\r\n\r\nV.--This part of Gaul having been tranquillized, he applies himself\r\nentirely both in mind and soul to the war with the Treviri and Ambiorix.\r\nHe orders Cavarinus to march with him with the cavalry of the Senones,\r\nlest any commotion should arise either out of his hot temper, or out of\r\nthe hatred of the state which he had incurred. After arranging these\r\nthings, as he considered it certain that Ambiorix would not contend in\r\nbattle, he watched his other plans attentively. The Menapii bordered on\r\nthe territories of the Eburones, and were protected by one continued\r\nextent of morasses and woods; and they alone out of Gaul had never sent\r\nambassadors to Caesar on the subject of peace. Caesar knew that a tie of\r\nhospitality subsisted between them and Ambiorix: he also discovered that\r\nthe latter had entered into an alliance with the Germans by means of the\r\nTreviri. He thought that these auxiliaries ought to be detached from him\r\nbefore he provoked him to war; lest he, despairing of safety, should\r\neither proceed to conceal himself in the territories of the Menapii, or\r\nshould be driven to coalesce with the Germans beyond the Rhine. Having\r\nentered upon this resolution, he sends the baggage of the whole army to\r\nLabienus, in the territories of the Treviri and orders two legions to\r\nproceed to him: he himself proceeds against the Menapii with five\r\nlightly-equipped legions. They, having assembled no troops, as they\r\nrelied on the defence of their position, retreat into the woods and\r\nmorasses, and convey thither all their property.\r\n\r\nVI.--Caesar, having divided his forces with C. Fabius, his lieutenant,\r\nand M. Crassus, his questor, and having hastily constructed some\r\nbridges, enters their country in three divisions, burns their houses and\r\nvillages, and gets possession of a large number of cattle and men.\r\nConstrained by these circumstances, the Menapii send ambassadors to him\r\nfor the purpose of suing for peace. He, after receiving hostages,\r\nassures them that he will consider them in the number of his enemies if\r\nthey shall receive within their territories either Ambiorix or his\r\nambassadors. Having determinately settled these things, he left among\r\nthe Menapii, Commius the Atrebatian with some cavalry as a guard; he\r\nhimself proceeds toward the Treviri.\r\n\r\nVII.--While these things are being performed by Caesar, the Treviri,\r\nhaving drawn together large forces of infantry and of cavalry, were\r\npreparing to attack Labienus and the legion which was wintering in their\r\nterritories, and were already not further distant from him than a\r\njourney of two days, when they learn that two legions had arrived by the\r\norder of Caesar. Having pitched their camp fifteen miles off, they\r\nresolve to await the support of the Germans. Labienus, having learned\r\nthe design of the enemy, hoping that through their rashness there would\r\nbe some opportunity of engaging, after leaving a guard of five cohorts\r\nfor the baggage, advances against the enemy with twenty-five cohorts and\r\na large body of cavalry, and, leaving the space of a mile between them,\r\nfortifies his camp. There was between Labienus and the enemy a river\r\ndifficult to cross and with steep banks: this neither did he himself\r\ndesign to cross, nor did he suppose the enemy would cross it. Their hope\r\nof auxiliaries was daily increasing. He [Labienus] openly says in a\r\ncouncil that \"since the Germans are said to be approaching, he would not\r\nbring into uncertainty his own and the army's fortunes, and the next day\r\nwould move his camp at early dawn. These words are quickly carried to\r\nthe enemy, since out of so large a number of cavalry composed of Gauls,\r\nnature compelled some to favour the Gallic interests. Labienus, having\r\nassembled the tribunes of the soldiers and principal centurions by\r\nnight, states what his design is, and, that he may the more easily give\r\nthe enemy a belief of his fears, he orders the camp to be moved with\r\ngreater noise and confusion than was usual with the Roman people. By\r\nthese means he makes his departure [appear], like a retreat. These\r\nthings, also, since the camps were so near, are reported to the enemy by\r\nscouts before daylight.\r\n\r\nVIII.--Scarcely had the rear advanced beyond the fortifications when the\r\nGauls, encouraging one another \"not to cast from their hands the\r\nanticipated booty, that it was a tedious thing, while the Romans were\r\npanic stricken, to be waiting for the aid of the Germans, and that their\r\ndignity did not suffer them to fear to attack with such great forces so\r\nsmall a band, particularly when retreating and encumbered,\" do not\r\nhesitate to cross the river and give battle in a disadvantageous\r\nposition. Labienus suspecting that these things would happen, was\r\nproceeding quietly, and using the same pretence of a march, in order\r\nthat he might entice them across the river. Then, having sent forward\r\nthe baggage some short distance and placed it on a certain eminence, he\r\nsays, \"Soldiers, you have the opportunity you have sought: you hold the\r\nenemy in an encumbered and disadvantageous position: display to us your\r\nleaders the same valour you have ofttimes displayed to your general:\r\nimagine that he is present and actually sees these exploits.\" At the\r\nsame time he orders the troops to face about towards the enemy and form\r\nin line of battle, and, despatching a few troops of cavalry as a guard\r\nfor the bag gage, he places the rest of the horse on the wings. Our men,\r\nraising a shout, quickly throw their javelins at the enemy. They, when,\r\ncontrary to their expectation, they saw those whom they believed to be\r\nretreating, advance towards them with threatening banners, were not able\r\nto sustain even the charge, and, being put to flight at the first\r\nonslaught, sought the nearest woods: Labienus pursuing them with the\r\ncavalry, upon a large number being slain, and several taken prisoners,\r\ngot possession of the state a few days after; for the Germans who were\r\ncoming to the aid of the Treviri, having been informed of their flight,\r\nretreated to their homes. The relations of Indutiomarus, who had been\r\nthe promoters of the revolt, accompanying them, quitted their own state\r\nwith them. The supreme power and government were delivered to\r\nCingetorix, whom we have stated to have remained firm in his allegiance\r\nfrom the commencement.\r\n\r\nIX.--Caesar, after he came from the territories of the Menapii into\r\nthose of the Treviri, resolved for two reasons to cross the Rhine; one\r\nof which was, because they had sent assistance to the Treviri against\r\nhim; the other, that Ambiorix might not have a retreat among them.\r\nHaving determined on these matters, he began to build a bridge a little\r\nabove that place, at which he had before conveyed over his army. The\r\nplan having been known and laid down, the work is accomplished in a few\r\ndays by the great exertion of the soldiers. Having left a strong guard\r\nat the bridge on the side of the Treviri, lest any commotion should\r\nsuddenly arise among them, he leads over the rest of the forces and the\r\ncavalry. The Ubii, who before had sent hostages and come to a\r\ncapitulation, send ambassadors to him, for the purpose of vindicating\r\nthemselves, to assure him that \"neither had auxiliaries been sent to the\r\nTreviri from their state, nor had they violated their allegiance\"; they\r\nentreat and beseech him \"to spare them, lest, in his common hatred of\r\nthe Germans, the innocent should suffer the penalty of the guilty: they\r\npromise to give more hostages, if he desire them.\" Having investigated\r\nthe case, Caesar finds that the auxiliaries had been sent by the Suevi;\r\nhe accepts the apology of the Ubii, and makes minute inquiries\r\nconcerning the approaches and the routes to the territories of the\r\nSuevi. X.--In the meanwhile he is informed by the Ubii, a few days\r\nafter, that the Suevi are drawing all their forces into one place, and\r\nare giving orders to those nations which are under their government to\r\nsend auxiliaries of infantry and of cavalry. Having learned these\r\nthings, he provides a supply of corn, selects a proper place for his\r\ncamp, and commands the Ubii to drive off their cattle and carry away all\r\ntheir possessions from the country parts into the towns, hoping that\r\nthey, being a barbarous and ignorant people, when harassed by the want\r\nof provisions, might be brought to an engagement on disadvantageous\r\nterms: he orders them to send numerous scouts among the Suevi, and learn\r\nwhat things are going on among them. They execute the orders, and, a few\r\ndays having intervened, report that all the Suevi, after certain\r\nintelligence concerning the army of the Romans had come, retreated with\r\nall their own forces and those of their allies, which they had\r\nassembled, to the utmost extremities of their territories: that there is\r\na wood there of very great extent, which is called Bacenis; that this\r\nstretches a great way into the interior, and, being opposed as a natural\r\nbarrier, defends from injuries and incursions the Cherusci against the\r\nSuevi, and the Suevi against the Cherusci: that at the entrance of that\r\nforest the Suevi had determined to await the coming up of the Romans.\r\n\r\nXI.--Since we have come to this place, it does not appear to be foreign\r\nto our subject to lay before the reader an account of the manners of\r\nGaul and Germany, and wherein these nations differ from each other. In\r\nGaul there are factions not only in all the states, and in all the\r\ncantons and their divisions, but almost in each family, and of these\r\nfactions those are the leaders who are considered according to their\r\njudgment to possess the greatest influence, upon whose will and\r\ndetermination the management of all affairs and measures depends. And\r\nthat seems to have been instituted in ancient times with this view, that\r\nno one of the common people should be in want of support against one\r\nmore powerful; for none [of those leaders] suffers his party to be\r\noppressed and defrauded, and if he do otherwise, he has no influence\r\namong his party. This same policy exists throughout the whole of Gaul;\r\nfor all the states are divided into two factions.\r\n\r\nXII.--When Caesar arrived in Gaul, the Aedui were the leaders of one\r\nfaction, the Sequani of the other. Since the latter were less powerful\r\nby themselves, inasmuch as the chief influence was from of old among the\r\nAedui, and their dependencies were great, they had united to themselves\r\nthe Germans and Ariovistus, and had brought them over to their party by\r\ngreat sacrifices and promises. And having fought several successful\r\nbattles and slain all the nobility of the Aedui, they had so far\r\nsurpassed them in power, that they brought over, from the Aedui to\r\nthemselves, a large portion of their dependants and received from them\r\nthe sons of their leading men as hostages, and compelled them to swear\r\nin their public character that they would enter into no design against\r\nthem; and held a portion of the neighbouring land, seized on by force,\r\nand possessed the sovereignty of the whole of Gaul. Divitiacus urged by\r\nthis necessity, had proceeded to Rome to the senate, for the purpose of\r\nentreating assistance, and had returned without accomplishing his\r\nobject. A change of affairs ensued on the arrival of Caesar, the\r\nhostages were returned to the Aedui, their old dependencies restored,\r\nand new acquired through Caesar (because those who had attached\r\nthemselves to their alliance saw that they enjoyed a better state and a\r\nmilder government), their other interests, their influence, their\r\nreputation were likewise increased, and in consequence, the Sequani lost\r\nthe sovereignty. The Remi succeeded to their place, and, as it was\r\nperceived that they equalled the Aedui in favour with Caesar, those, who\r\non account of their old animosities could by no means coalesce with the\r\nAedui, consigned themselves in clientship to the Remi. The latter\r\ncarefully protected them. Thus they possessed both a new and suddenly\r\nacquired influence. Affairs were then in that position, that the Aedui\r\nwere considered by far the leading people, and the Remi held the second\r\npost of honour.\r\n\r\nXIII.--Throughout all Gaul there are two orders of those men who are of\r\nany rank and dignity: for the commonality is held almost in the\r\ncondition of slaves, and dares to undertake nothing of itself and is\r\nadmitted to no deliberation. The greater part, when they are pressed\r\neither by debt, or the large amount of their tributes, or the oppression\r\nof the more powerful, give themselves up in vassalage to the nobles, who\r\npossess over them the same rights without exception as masters over\r\ntheir slaves. But of these two orders, one is that of the Druids, the\r\nother that of the knights. The former are engaged in things sacred,\r\nconduct the public and the private sacrifices, and interpret all matters\r\nof religion. To these a large number of the young men resort for the\r\npurpose of instruction, and they [the Druids] are in great honour among\r\nthem. For they determine respecting almost all controversies, public and\r\nprivate; and if any crime has been perpetrated, if murder has been\r\ncommitted, if there be any dispute about an inheritance, if any about\r\nboundaries, these same persons decide it; they decree rewards and\r\npunishments if any one, either in a private or public capacity, has not\r\nsubmitted to their decision, they interdict him from the sacrifices.\r\nThis among them is the most heavy punishment. Those who have been thus\r\ninterdicted are esteemed in the number of the impious and the criminal:\r\nall shun them, and avoid their society and conversation, lest they\r\nreceive some evil from their contact; nor is justice administered to\r\nthem when seeking it, nor is any dignity bestowed on them. Over all\r\nthese Druids one presides, who possesses supreme authority among them.\r\nUpon his death, if any individual among the rest is pre-eminent in\r\ndignity, he succeeds; but, if there are many equal, the election is made\r\nby the suffrages of the Druids; sometimes they even contend for the\r\npresidency with arms. These assemble at a fixed period of the year in a\r\nconsecrated place in the territories of the Carnutes, which is reckoned\r\nthe central region of the whole of Gaul. Hither all, who have disputes,\r\nassemble from every part, and submit to their decrees and\r\ndeterminations. This institution is supposed to have been devised in\r\nBritain, and to have been brought over from it into Gaul; and now those\r\nwho desire to gain a more accurate knowledge of that system generally\r\nproceed thither for the purpose of studying it.\r\n\r\nXIV.--The Druids do not go to war, nor pay tribute together with the\r\nrest; they have an exemption from military service and a dispensation in\r\nall matters. Induced by such great advantages, many embrace this\r\nprofession of their own accord, and [many] are sent to it by their\r\nparents and relations. They are said there to learn by heart a great\r\nnumber of verses; accordingly some remain in the course of training\r\ntwenty years. Nor do they regard it lawful to commit these to writing,\r\nthough in almost all other matters, in their public and private\r\ntransactions, they use Greek characters. That practice they seem to me\r\nto have adopted for two reasons; because they neither desire their\r\ndoctrines to be divulged among the mass of the people, nor those who\r\nlearn, to devote themselves the less to the efforts of memory, relying\r\non writing; since it generally occurs to most men, that, in their\r\ndependence on writing, they relax their diligence in learning\r\nthoroughly, and their employment of the memory. They wish to inculcate\r\nthis as one of their leading tenets, that souls do not become extinct,\r\nbut pass after death from one body to another, and they think that men\r\nby this tenet are in a great degree excited to valour, the fear of death\r\nbeing disregarded. They likewise discuss and impart to the youth many\r\nthings respecting the stars and their motion, respecting the extent of\r\nthe world and of our earth, respecting the nature of things, respecting\r\nthe power and the majesty of the immortal gods.\r\n\r\nXV.--The other order is that of the knights. These, when there is\r\noccasion and any war occurs (which before Caesar's arrival was for the\r\nmost part wont to happen every year, as either they on their part were\r\ninflicting injuries or repelling those which others inflicted on them),\r\nare all engaged in war. And those of them most distinguished by birth\r\nand resources, have the greatest number of vassals and dependants about\r\nthem. They acknowledge this sort of influence and power only.\r\n\r\nXVI.--The nation of all the Gauls is extremely devoted to superstitious\r\nrites; and on that account they who are troubled with unusually severe\r\ndiseases and they who are engaged in battles and dangers, either\r\nsacrifice men as victims, or vow that they will sacrifice them, and\r\nemploy the Druids as the performers of those sacrifices; because they\r\nthink that unless the life of a man be offered for the life of a man,\r\nthe mind of the immortal gods cannot be rendered propitious, and they\r\nhave sacrifices of that kind ordained for national purposes. Others have\r\nfigures of vast size, the limbs of which formed of osiers they fill with\r\nliving men, which being set on fire, the men perish enveloped in the\r\nflames. They consider that the oblation of such as have been taken in\r\ntheft, or in robbery, or any other offence, is more acceptable to the\r\nimmortal gods; but when a supply of that class is wanting, they have\r\nrecourse to the oblation of even the innocent.\r\n\r\nXVII.--They worship as their divinity, Mercury in particular, and have\r\nmany images of him, and regard him as the inventor of all arts, they\r\nconsider him, the guide of their journeys and marches, and believe him\r\nto have very great influence over the acquisition of gain and mercantile\r\ntransactions. Next to him they worship Apollo, and Mars, and Jupiter,\r\nand Minerva; respecting these deities they have for the most part the\r\nsame belief as other nations: that Apollo averts diseases, that Minerva\r\nimparts the invention of manufactures, that Jupiter possesses the\r\nsovereignty of the heavenly powers; that Mars presides over wars. To him\r\nwhen they have determined to engage in battle, they commonly vow those\r\nthings they shall take in war. When they have conquered, they sacrifice\r\nwhatever captured animals may have survived the conflict, and collect\r\nthe other things into one place. In many states you may see piles of\r\nthese things heaped up in their consecrated spots; nor does it often\r\nhappen that any one, disregarding the sanctity of the case, dares either\r\nto secrete in his house things captured, or take away those deposited;\r\nand the most severe punishment, with torture, has been established for\r\nsuch a deed.\r\n\r\nXVIII.--All the Gauls assert that they are descended from the god Dis,\r\nand say that this tradition has been handed down by the Druids. For that\r\nreason they compute the divisions of every season, not by the number of\r\ndays, but of nights; they keep birthdays and the beginnings of months\r\nand years in such an order that the day follows the night. Among the\r\nother usages of their life, they differ in this from almost all other\r\nnations, that they do not permit their children to approach them openly\r\nuntil they are grown up so as to be able to bear the service of war; and\r\nthey regard it as indecorous for a son of boyish age to stand in public\r\nin the presence of his father.\r\n\r\nXIX.--Whatever sums of money the husbands have received in the name of\r\ndowry from their wives, making an estimate of it, they add the same\r\namount out of their own estates. An account is kept of all this money\r\nconjointly, and the profits are laid by: whichever of them shall have\r\nsurvived [the other], to that one the portion of both reverts, together\r\nwith the profits of the previous time. Husbands have power of life and\r\ndeath over their wives as well as over their children: and when the\r\nfather of a family, born in a more than commonly distinguished rank, has\r\ndied, his relations assemble, and, if the circumstances of his death are\r\nsuspicious, hold an investigation upon the wives in the manner adopted\r\ntowards slaves; and if proof be obtained, put them to severe torture,\r\nand kill them. Their funerals, considering the state of civilization\r\namong the Gauls, are magnificent and costly; and they cast into the fire\r\nall things, including living creatures, which they suppose to have been\r\ndear to them when alive; and, a little before this period, slaves and\r\ndependants, who were ascertained to have been beloved by them, were,\r\nafter the regular funeral rites were completed, burnt together with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nXX.--Those states which are considered to conduct their commonwealth\r\nmore judiciously, have it ordained by their laws, that, if any person\r\nshall have heard by rumour and report from his neighbours anything\r\nconcerning the commonwealth, he shall convey it to the magistrate and\r\nnot impart it to any other; because it has been discovered that\r\ninconsiderate and inexperienced men were often alarmed by false reports\r\nand driven to some rash act, or else took hasty measures in affairs of\r\nthe highest importance. The magistrates conceal those things which\r\nrequire to be kept unknown; and they disclose to the people whatever\r\nthey determine to be expedient. It is not lawful to speak of the\r\ncommonwealth, except in council.\r\n\r\nXXI.--The Germans differ much from these usages, for they have neither\r\nDruids to preside over sacred offices, nor do they pay great regard to\r\nsacrifices. They rank in the number of the gods those alone whom they\r\nbehold, and by whose instrumentality they are obviously benefited,\r\nnamely, the sun, fire, and the moon; they have not heard of the other\r\ndeities even by report. Their whole life is occupied in hunting and in\r\nthe pursuits of the military art; from childhood they devote themselves\r\nto fatigue and hardships. Those who have remained chaste for the longest\r\ntime, receive the greatest commendation among their people: they think\r\nthat by this the growth is promoted, by this the physical powers are\r\nincreased and the sinews are strengthened. And to have had knowledge of\r\na woman before the twentieth year they reckon among the most disgraceful\r\nacts; of which matter there is no concealment, because they bathe\r\npromiscuously in the rivers and [only] use skins or small cloaks of\r\ndeers' hides, a large portion of the body being in consequence naked.\r\n\r\nXXII.--They do not pay much attention to agriculture, and a large\r\nportion of their food consists in milk, cheese, and flesh; nor has any\r\none a fixed quantity of land or his own individual limits; but the\r\nmagistrates and the leading men each year apportion to the tribes and\r\nfamilies, who have united together, as much land as, and in the place in\r\nwhich, they think proper, and the year after compel them to remove\r\nelsewhere. For this enactment they advance many reasons--lest seduced by\r\nlong-continued custom, they may exchange their ardour in the waging of\r\nwar for agriculture; lest they may be anxious to acquire extensive\r\nestates, and the more powerful drive the weaker from their possessions;\r\nlest they construct their houses with too great a desire to avoid cold\r\nand heat; lest the desire of wealth spring up, from which cause\r\ndivisions and discords arise; and that they may keep the common people\r\nin a contented state of mind, when each sees his own means placed on an\r\nequality with [those of] the most powerful.\r\n\r\nXXIII.--It is the greatest glory to the several states to have as wide\r\ndeserts as possible around them, their frontiers having been laid waste.\r\nThey consider this the real evidence of their prowess, that their\r\nneighbours shall be driven out of their lands and abandon them, and that\r\nno one dare settle near them; at the same time they think that they\r\nshall be on that account the more secure, because they have removed the\r\napprehension of a sudden incursion. When a state either repels war waged\r\nagainst it, or wages it against another, magistrates are chosen to\r\npreside over that war with such authority, that they have power of life\r\nand death. In peace there is no common magistrate, but the chiefs of\r\nprovinces and cantons administer justice and determine controversies\r\namong their own people. Robberies which are committed beyond the\r\nboundaries of each state bear no infamy, and they avow that these are\r\ncommitted for the purpose of disciplining their youth and of preventing\r\nsloth. And when any of their chiefs has said in an assembly \"that he\r\nwill be their leader, let those who are willing to follow, give in their\r\nnames\"; they who approve of both the enterprise and the man arise and\r\npromise their assistance and are applauded by the people; such of them\r\nas have not followed him are accounted in the number of deserters and\r\ntraitors, and confidence in all matters is afterwards refused them. To\r\ninjure guests they regard as impious; they defend from wrong those who\r\nhave come to them for any purpose whatever, and esteem them inviolable;\r\nto them the houses of all are open and maintenance is freely supplied.\r\n\r\nXXIV.--And there was formerly a time when the Gauls excelled the Germans\r\nin prowess, and waged war on them offensively, and, on account of the\r\ngreat number of their people and the insufficiency of their land, sent\r\ncolonies over the Rhine. Accordingly, the Volcae Tectosages seized on\r\nthose parts of Germany which are the most fruitful [and lie] around the\r\nHercynian forest (which, I perceive, was known by report to Eratosthenes\r\nand some other Greeks, and which they call Orcynia) and settled there.\r\nWhich nation to this time retains its position in those settlements, and\r\nhas a very high character for justice and military merit: now also they\r\ncontinue in the same scarcity, indigence, hardihood, as the Germans, and\r\nuse the same food and dress; but their proximity to the Province and\r\nknowledge of commodities from countries beyond the sea supplies to the\r\nGauls many things tending to luxury as well as civilization. Accustomed\r\nby degrees to be overmatched and worsted in many engagements, they do\r\nnot even compare themselves to the Germans in prowess.\r\n\r\nXXV.--The breadth of this Hercynian forest, which has been referred to\r\nabove, is to a quick traveller, a journey of nine days. For it cannot be\r\notherwise computed, nor are they acquainted with the measures of roads.\r\nIt begins at the frontiers of the Helvetii, Nemetes, and Rauraci, and\r\nextends in a right line along the river Danube to the territories of the\r\nDaci and the Anartes: it bends thence to the left in a different\r\ndirection from the river, and owing to its extent touches the confines\r\nof many nations; nor is there any person belonging to this part of\r\nGermany who says that he either has gone to the extremity of that\r\nforest, though he had advanced a journey of sixty days, or has heard in\r\nwhat place it begins. It is certain that many kinds of wild beasts are\r\nproduced in it which have not been seen in other parts; of which the\r\nfollowing are such as differ principally from other animals, and appear\r\nworthy of being committed to record.\r\n\r\nXXVI.--There is an ox of the shape of a stag, between whose ears a horn\r\nrises from the middle of the forehead, higher and straighter than those\r\nhorns which are known to us. From the top of this, branches, like palms;\r\nstretch out a considerable distance. The shape of the female and of the\r\nmale is the same; the appearance and the size of the horns is the same.\r\n\r\nXXVII.--There are also [animals] which are called elks. The shape of\r\nthese, and the varied colour of their skins, is much like roes, but in\r\nsize they surpass them a little and are destitute of horns, and have\r\nlegs without joints and ligatures; nor do they lie down for the purpose\r\nof rest, nor, if they have been thrown down by any accident, can they\r\nraise or lift themselves up. Trees serve as beds to them; they lean\r\nthemselves against them, and thus reclining only slightly, they take\r\ntheir rest; when the huntsmen have discovered from the footsteps of\r\nthese animals whither they are accustomed to betake themselves, they\r\neither undermine all the trees at the roots, or cut into them so far\r\nthat the upper part of the trees may appear to be left standing. When\r\nthey have leant upon them, according to their habit, they knock down by\r\ntheir weight the unsupported trees, and fall down themselves along with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nXXVIII.-There is a third kind, consisting of those animals which are\r\ncalled uri. These are a little below the elephant in size, and of the\r\nappearance, colour, and shape of a bull. Their strength and speed are\r\nextraordinary; they spare neither man nor wild beast which they have\r\nespied. These the Germans take with much pains in pits and kill them.\r\nThe young men harden themselves with this exercise, and practice\r\nthemselves in this kind of hunting, and those who have slain the\r\ngreatest number of them, having produced the horns in public, to serve\r\nas evidence, receive great praise. But not even when taken very young\r\ncan they be rendered familiar to men and tamed. The size, shape, and\r\nappearance of their horns differ much from the horns of our oxen. These\r\nthey anxiously seek after, and bind at the tips with silver, and use as\r\ncups at their most sumptuous entertainments.\r\n\r\nXXIX.--Caesar, after he discovered through the Ubian scouts that the\r\nSuevi had retired into their woods, apprehending a scarcity of corn,\r\nbecause, as we have observed above, all the Germans pay very little\r\nattention to agriculture, resolved not to proceed any farther; but, that\r\nhe might not altogether relieve the barbarians from the fear of his\r\nreturn, and that he might delay their succours, having led back his\r\narmy, he breaks down, to the length of 200 feet, the farther end of the\r\nbridge, which joined the banks of the Ubii, and, at the extremity of the\r\nbridge raises towers of four stories, and stations a guard of twelve\r\ncohorts for the purpose of defending the bridge, and strengthens the\r\nplace with considerable fortifications. Over that fort and guard he\r\nappointed C. Volcatius Tullus, a young man; he himself, when the corn\r\nbegan to ripen, having set forth for the war with 40 Ambiorix (through\r\nthe forest Arduenna, which is the largest of all Gaul, and reaches from\r\nthe banks of the Rhine and the frontiers of the Treviri to those of the\r\nNervii, and extends over more than 500 miles), he sends forward L.\r\nMinucius Basilus with all the cavalry, to try if he might gain any\r\nadvantage by rapid marches and the advantage of time, he warns him to\r\nforbid fires being made in the camp, lest any indication of his approach\r\nbe given at a distance: he tells him that he will follow immediately.\r\n\r\nXXX.--Basilus does as he was commanded; having performed his march\r\nrapidly, and even surpassed the expectations of all, he surprises in the\r\nfields many not expecting him; through their information he advances\r\ntowards Ambiorix himself, to the place in which he was said to be with a\r\nfew horse. Fortune accomplishes much, not only in other matters, but\r\nalso in the art of war. For as it happened by a remarkable chance, that\r\nhe fell upon [Ambiorix] himself unguarded and unprepared, and that his\r\narrival was seen by the people before the report or information of his\r\narrival was carried thither; so it was an incident of extraordinary\r\nfortune that, although every implement of war which he was accustomed to\r\nhave about him was seized, and his chariots and horses surprised, yet he\r\nhimself escaped death. But it was effected owing to this circumstance,\r\nthat his house being surrounded by a wood, (as are generally the\r\ndwellings of the Gauls, who, for the purpose of avoiding heat, mostly\r\nseek the neighbourhood of woods and rivers) his attendants and friends\r\nin a narrow spot sustained for a short time the attack of our horse.\r\nWhile they were fighting, one of his followers mounted him on a horse:\r\nthe woods sheltered him as he fled. Thus fortune tended much both\r\ntowards his encountering and his escaping danger.\r\n\r\nXXXI.--Whether Ambiorix did not collect his forces from cool\r\ndeliberation, because he considered he ought not to engage in a battle,\r\nor [whether] he was debarred by time and prevented by the sudden arrival\r\nof our horse, when he supposed the rest of the army was closely\r\nfollowing, is doubtful; but certainly, despatching messengers through\r\nthe country, he ordered every one to provide for himself; and a part of\r\nthem fled into the forest Arduenna, a part into the extensive morasses;\r\nthose who were nearest the ocean, concealed themselves in the islands\r\nwhich the tides usually form; many, departing from their territories,\r\ncommitted themselves and all their possessions to perfect strangers.\r\nCativolcus, king of one-half of the Eburones, who had entered into the\r\ndesign together with Ambiorix, since, being now worn out by age, he was\r\nunable to endure the fatigue either of war or flight, having cursed\r\nAmbiorix with every imprecation, as the person who had been the\r\ncontriver of that measure, destroyed himself with the juice of the yew\r\ntree, of which there is a great abundance in Gaul and Germany.\r\n\r\nXXXII.--The Segui and Condrusi, of the nation and number of the Germans,\r\nand who are between the Eburones and the Treviri, sent ambassadors to\r\nCaesar to entreat that he would not regard them in the number of his\r\nenemies, nor consider that the cause of all the Germans on this side the\r\nRhine was one and the same; that they had formed no plans of war, and\r\nhad sent no auxiliaries to Ambiorix. Caesar, having ascertained this\r\nfact by an examination of his prisoners commanded that if any of the\r\nEburones in their flight had repaired to them, they should be sent back\r\nto him; he assures them that if they did that, he will not injure their\r\nterritories. Then, having divided his forces into three parts, he sent\r\nthe baggage of all the legions to Aduatuca. That is the name of a fort.\r\nThis is nearly in the middle of the Eburones, where Titurius and\r\nAurunculeius had been quartered for the purpose of wintering. This place\r\nhe selected as well on other accounts as because the fortifications of\r\nthe previous year remained, in order that he might relieve the labour of\r\nthe soldiers. He left the fourteenth legion as a guard for the baggage,\r\none of those three which he had lately raised in Italy and brought over.\r\nOver that legion and camp he places Q. Tullius Cicero and gives him 200\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nXXXIII.--Having divided the army, he orders T. Labienus to proceed with\r\nthree legions towards the ocean into those parts which border on the\r\nMenappii; he sends C. Trebonius with a like number of legions to lay\r\nwaste that district which lies contiguous to the Aduatuci; he himself\r\ndetermines to go with the remaining three to the river Sambre, which\r\nflows into the Meuse, and to the most remote parts of Arduenna, whither\r\nhe heard that Ambiorix had gone with a few horse. When departing, he\r\npromises that he will return before the end of the seventh day, on which\r\nday he was aware corn was due to that legion which was being left in\r\ngarrison. He directs Labienus and Trebonius to return by the same day,\r\nif they can do so agreeably to the interests of the republic; so that\r\ntheir measures having been mutually imparted, and the plans of the enemy\r\nhaving been discovered, they might be able to commence a different line\r\nof operations.\r\n\r\nXXXIV.--There was, as we have above observed, no regular army, nor a\r\ntown, nor a garrison which could defend itself by arms; but the people\r\nwere scattered in all directions. Where either a hidden valley, or a\r\nwoody spot, or a difficult morass furnished any hope of protection or of\r\nsecurity to any one, there he had fixed himself. These places were known\r\nto those that dwelt in the neighbourhood, and the matter demanded great\r\nattention, not so much in protecting the main body of the army (for no\r\nperil could occur to them altogether from those alarmed and scattered\r\ntroops), as in preserving individual soldiers; which in some measure\r\ntended to the safety of the army. For both the desire of booty was\r\nleading many too far, and the woods with their unknown and hidden routes\r\nwould not allow them to go in large bodies. If he desired the business\r\nto be completed and the race of those infamous people to be cut off,\r\nmore bodies of men must be sent in several directions and the soldiers\r\nmust be detached on all sides; if he were disposed to keep the companies\r\nat their standards, as the established discipline and practice of the\r\nRoman army required, the situation itself was a safeguard to the\r\nbarbarians, nor was there wanting to individuals the daring to lay\r\nsecret ambuscades and beset scattered soldiers. But amidst difficulties\r\nof this nature as far as precautions could be taken by vigilance, such\r\nprecautions were taken; so that some opportunities of injuring the enemy\r\nwere neglected, though the minds of all were burning to take revenge,\r\nrather than that injury should be effected with any loss to our\r\nsoldiers. Caesar despatches messengers to the neighbouring states; by\r\nthe hope of booty he invites all to him, for the purpose of plundering\r\nthe Eburones, in order that the life of the Gauls might be hazarded in\r\nthe woods rather than the legionary soldiers; at the same time, in order\r\nthat a large force being drawn around them, the race and name of that\r\nstate may be annihilated for such a crime. A large number from all\r\nquarters speedily assembles.\r\n\r\nXXXV.--These things were going on in all parts of the territories of the\r\nEburones, and the seventh day was drawing near, by which day Caesar had\r\npurposed to return to the baggage and the legion. Here it might be\r\nlearned how much fortune achieves in war, and how great casualties she\r\nproduces. The enemy having been scattered and alarmed, as we related\r\nabove, there was no force which might produce even a slight occasion of\r\nfear. The report extends beyond the Rhine to the Germans that the\r\nEburones are being pillaged, and that all were without distinction\r\ninvited to the plunder. The Sigambri, who are nearest to the Rhine, by\r\nwhom, we have mentioned above, the Tenchtheri and Usipetes were received\r\nafter their retreat, collect 2000 horse; they cross the Rhine in ships\r\nand barks thirty miles below that place where the bridge was entire and\r\nthe garrison left by Caesar; they arrive at the frontiers of the\r\nEburones, surprise many who were scattered in flight, and get possession\r\nof a large amount of cattle, of which barbarians are extremely covetous.\r\nAllured by booty, they advance farther; neither morass nor forest\r\nobstructs these men, born amidst war and depredations; they inquire of\r\ntheir prisoners in what parts Caesar is; they find that he has advanced\r\nfarther, and learn that all the army has removed. Thereon one of the\r\nprisoners says, \"Why do you pursue such wretched and trifling spoil;\r\nyou, to whom it is granted to become even now most richly endowed by\r\nfortune? In three hours you can reach Aduatuca; there the Roman army has\r\ndeposited all its fortunes; there is so little of a garrison that not\r\neven the wall can be manned, nor dare any one go beyond the\r\nfortifications.\" A hope having been presented them, the Germans leave in\r\nconcealment the plunder they had acquired; they themselves hasten to\r\nAduatuca, employing as their guide the same man by whose information\r\nthey had become informed of these things.\r\n\r\nXXXVI.--Cicero, who during all the foregoing days had kept his soldiers\r\nin camp with the greatest exactness, and agreeably to the injunctions of\r\nCaesar, had not permitted even any of the camp-followers to go beyond\r\nthe fortification, distrusting on the seventh day that Caesar would keep\r\nhis promise as to the number of days, because he heard that he had\r\nproceeded farther, and no report as to his return was brought to him,\r\nand being urged at the same time by the expressions of those who called\r\nhis tolerance almost a siege, if, forsooth, it was not permitted them to\r\ngo out of the camp, since he might expect no disaster, whereby he could\r\nbe injured, within three miles of the camp, while nine legions and all\r\nthe cavalry were under arms, and the enemy scattered and almost\r\nannihilated, sent five cohorts into the neighbouring cornlands, between\r\nwhich and the camp only one hill intervened, for the purpose of\r\nforaging. Many soldiers of the legions had been left invalided in the\r\ncamp, of whom those who had recovered in this space of time, being about\r\n300, are set together under one standard; a large number of soldiers'\r\nattendants besides, with a great number of beasts of burden, which had\r\nremained in the camp, permission being granted, follow them.\r\n\r\nXXXVII.--At this very time, the German horse by chance come up, and\r\nimmediately, with the same speed with which they had advanced, attempt\r\nto force the camp at the Decuman gate, nor were they seen, in\r\nconsequence of woods lying in the way on that side, before they were\r\njust reaching the camp: so much so, that the sutlers who had their\r\nbooths under the rampart had not an opportunity of retreating within the\r\ncamp. Our men, not anticipating it, are perplexed by the sudden affair,\r\nand the cohort on the outpost scarcely sustains the first attack. The\r\nenemy spread themselves on the other sides to ascertain if they could\r\nfind any access. Our men with difficulty defend the gates; the very\r\nposition of itself and the fortification secures the other accesses.\r\nThere is a panic in the entire camp, and one inquires of another the\r\ncause of the confusion, nor do they readily determine whither the\r\nstandards should be borne, nor into what quarter each should betake\r\nhimself. One avows that the camp is already taken, another maintains\r\nthat, the enemy having destroyed the army and commander-in-chief, are\r\ncome thither as conquerors; most form strange superstitious fancies from\r\nthe spot, and place before their eyes the catastrophe of Cotta and\r\nTiturius, who had fallen in the same fort. All being greatly\r\ndisconcerted by this alarm, the belief of the barbarians is strengthened\r\nthat there is no garrison within, as they had heard from their prisoner.\r\nThey endeavour to force an entrance and encourage one another not to\r\ncast from their hands so valuable a prize.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII.-P. Sextius Baculus, who had led a principal century under\r\nCaesar (of whom we have made mention in previous engagements), had been\r\nleft an invalid in the garrison, and had now been five days without\r\nfood. He, distrusting his own safety and that of all, goes forth from\r\nhis tent unarmed; he sees that the enemy are close at hand and that the\r\nmatter is in the utmost danger; he snatches arms from those nearest, and\r\nstations himself at the gate. The centurions of that cohort which was on\r\nguard follow him; for a short time they sustain the fight together.\r\nSextius faints, after receiving many wounds; he is with difficulty\r\nsaved, drawn away by the hands of the soldiers. This space having\r\nintervened, the others resume courage, so far as to venture to take\r\ntheir place on the fortifications and present the aspect of defenders.\r\n\r\nXXXIX.--The foraging having in the meantime been completed, our soldiers\r\ndistinctly hear the shout; the horse hasten on before and discover in\r\nwhat danger the affair is. But here there is no fortification to receive\r\nthem, in their alarm: those last enlisted and unskilled in military\r\ndiscipline turn their faces to the military tribune and the centurions;\r\nthey wait to find what orders may be given by them. No one is so\r\ncourageous as not to be disconcerted by the suddenness of the affair.\r\nThe barbarians, espying our standard in the distance, desist from the\r\nattack; at first they suppose that the legions, which they had learned\r\nfrom their prisoners had removed farther off, had returned; afterwards,\r\ndespising their small number, they make an attack on them at all sides.\r\n\r\nXL.-The camp-followers run forward to the nearest rising ground; being\r\nspeedily driven from this they throw themselves among the standards and\r\ncompanies: they thus so much the more alarm the soldiers already\r\naffrighted. Some propose that, forming a wedge, they suddenly break\r\nthrough, since the camp was so near; and if any part should be\r\nsurrounded and slain, they fully trust that at least the rest may be\r\nsaved; others, that they take their stand on an eminence, and all\r\nundergo the same destiny. The veteran soldiers, whom we stated to have\r\nset out together [with the others] under a standard, do not approve of\r\nthis. Therefore encouraging each other, under the conduct of Caius\r\nTrebonius, a Roman knight, who had been appointed over them, they break\r\nthrough the midst of the enemy, and arrive in the camp safe to a man.\r\nThe camp-attendants and the horse following close upon them with the\r\nsame impetuosity, are saved by the courage of the soldiers. But those\r\nwho had taken their stand upon the eminence having even now acquired no\r\nexperience of military matters, neither could persevere in that\r\nresolution which they approved of, namely, to defend themselves from\r\ntheir higher position, nor imitate that vigour and speed which they had\r\nobserved to have availed others; but, attempting to reach the camp, had\r\ndescended into an unfavourable situation. The Centurions, some of whom\r\nhad been promoted for their valour from the lower ranks of other legions\r\nto higher ranks in this legion, in order that they might not forfeit\r\ntheir glory for military exploits previously acquired, fell together\r\nfighting most valiantly. The enemy having been dislodged by their\r\nvalour, a part of the soldiers arrived safe in camp contrary to their\r\nexpectations; a part perished, surrounded by the barbarians.\r\n\r\nXLI.--The Germans, despairing of taking the camp by storm, because they\r\nsaw that our men had taken up their position on the fortifications,\r\nretreated beyond the Rhine with that plunder which they had deposited in\r\nthe woods. And so great was the alarm, even after the departure of the\r\nenemy, that when C. Volusenus, who had been sent with the cavalry,\r\narrived that night, he could not gain credence that Caesar was close at\r\nhand with his army safe. Fear had so pre-occupied the minds of all,\r\nthat, their reason being almost estranged, they said that all the other\r\nforces having been cut off, the cavalry alone had arrived there by\r\nflight, and asserted that, if the army were safe, the Germans would not\r\nhave attacked the camp: which fear the arrival of Caesar removed.\r\n\r\nXLII.--He, on his return, being well aware of the casualties of war,\r\ncomplained of one thing [only], namely, that the cohorts had been sent\r\naway from the outposts and garrison [duty], and pointed out that room\r\nought not to have been left for even the most trivial casualty; that\r\nfortune had exercised great influence in the sudden arrival of their\r\nenemy; much greater, in that she had turned the barbarians away from the\r\nvery rampart and gates of the camp. Of all which events, it seemed the\r\nmost surprising that the Germans, who had crossed the Rhine with this\r\nobject, that they might plunder the territories of Ambiorix, being led\r\nto the camp of the Romans, rendered Ambiorix a most acceptable service.\r\n\r\nXLIII.--Caesar, having again marched to harass the enemy, after\r\ncollecting a large number [of auxiliaries] from the neighbouring states,\r\ndespatches them in all directions. All the villages and all the\r\nbuildings, which each beheld, were on fire: spoil was being driven off\r\nfrom all parts; the corn not only was being consumed by so great numbers\r\nof cattle and men, but also had fallen to the earth, owing to the time\r\nof the year and the storms; so that if any had concealed themselves for\r\nthe present, still, it appeared likely that they must perish through\r\nwant of all things, when the army should be drawn off. And frequently it\r\ncame to that point, as so large a body of cavalry had been sent abroad\r\nin all directions, that the prisoners declared Ambiorix had just then\r\nbeen seen by them in flight, and had not even passed out of sight, so\r\nthat the hope of overtaking him being raised, and unbounded exertions\r\nhaving been resorted to, those who thought they should acquire the\r\nhighest favour with Caesar, nearly overcame nature by their ardour, and\r\ncontinually a little only seemed wanting to complete success; but he\r\nrescued himself by [means of] lurking-places and forests, and, concealed\r\nby the night, made for other districts and quarters, with no greater\r\nguard than that of four horsemen, to whom alone he ventured to confide\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nXLIV.--Having devastated the country in such a manner, Caesar leads back\r\nhis army with the loss of two cohorts to Durocortorum of the Remi, and,\r\nhaving summoned a council of Gaul to assemble at that place, he resolved\r\nto hold an investigation respecting the conspiracy of the Senones and\r\nCarnutes, and having pronounced a most severe sentence upon Acco, who\r\nhad been the contriver of that plot, he punished him after the custom of\r\nour ancestors. Some fearing a trial, fled; when he had forbidden these\r\nfire and water, he stationed in winter quarters two legions at the\r\nfrontiers of the Treviri, two among the Lingones, the remaining six at\r\nAgendicum, in the territories of the Senones; and, having provided corn\r\nfor the army, he set out for Italy, as he had determined, to hold the\r\nassizes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII\r\n\r\nI.--Gaul being tranquil, Caesar, as he had determined, sets out for\r\nItaly to hold the provincial assizes. There he receives intelligence of\r\nthe death of Clodius; and, being informed of the decree of the senate\r\n[to the effect] that all the youth of Italy should take the military\r\noath, he determined to hold a levy throughout the entire province.\r\nReport of these events is rapidly borne into Transalpine Gaul. The Gauls\r\nthemselves add to the report, and invent what the case seemed to\r\nrequire, [namely] that Caesar was detained by commotions in the city,\r\nand could not, amidst so violent dissensions, come to his army. Animated\r\nby this opportunity, they who already, previously to this occurrence,\r\nwere indignant that they were reduced beneath the dominion of Rome,\r\nbegin to organize their plans for war more openly and daringly. The\r\nleading men of Gaul, having convened councils among themselves in the\r\nwoods, and retired places, complain of the death of Acco: they point out\r\nthat this fate may fall in turn on themselves: they bewail the unhappy\r\nfate of Gaul; and by every sort of promises and rewards, they earnestly\r\nsolicit some to begin the war, and assert the freedom of Gaul at the\r\nhazard of their lives. They say that special care should be paid to\r\nthis, that Caesar should be cut off from his army, before their secret\r\nplans should be divulged. That this was easy, because neither would the\r\nlegions, in the absence of their general, dare to leave their winter\r\nquarters, nor could the general reach his army without a guard: finally,\r\nthat it was better to be slain in battle than not to recover their\r\nancient glory in war, and that freedom which they had received from\r\ntheir forefathers.\r\n\r\nII.--Whilst these things are in agitation, the Carnutes declare \"that\r\nthey would decline no danger for the sake of the general safety,\" and\r\npromise that they would be the first of all to begin the war; and since\r\nthey cannot at present take precautions, by giving and receiving\r\nhostages, that the affair shall not be divulged they require that a\r\nsolemn assurance be given them by oath and plighted honour, their\r\nmilitary standards being brought together (in which manner their most\r\nsacred obligations are made binding), that they should not be deserted\r\nby the rest of the Gauls on commencing the war.\r\n\r\nIII.--When the appointed day came, the Carnutes, under the command of\r\nCotuatus and Conetodunus, desperate men, meet together at Genabum, and\r\nslay the Roman citizens who had settled there for the purpose of trading\r\n(among the rest, Caius Fusius Cita, a distinguished Roman knight, who by\r\nCaesar's orders had presided over the provision department), and plunder\r\ntheir property. The report is quickly spread among all the states of\r\nGaul; for, whenever a more important and remarkable event takes place,\r\nthey transmit the intelligence through their lands and districts by a\r\nshout; the others take it up in succession, and pass it to their\r\nneighbours, as happened on this occasion; for the things which were done\r\nat Genabum at sunrise were heard in the territories of the Arverni\r\nbefore the end of the first watch, which is an extent of more than a\r\nhundred and sixty miles.\r\n\r\nIV.--There in like manner, Vercingetorix the son of Celtillus the\r\nArvernian, a young man of the highest power (whose father had held the\r\nsupremacy of entire Gaul, and had been put to death by his fellow\r\ncitizens, for this reason, because he aimed at sovereign power),\r\nsummoned together his dependents, and easily excited them. On his design\r\nbeing made known, they rush to arms: he is expelled from the town of\r\nGergovia by his uncle Gobanitio and the rest of the nobles, who were of\r\nopinion, that such an enterprise ought not to be hazarded: he did not\r\nhowever desist, but held in the country a levy of the needy and\r\ndesperate. Having collected such a body of troops, he brings over to his\r\n30 sentiments such of his fellow citizens as he has access to: he\r\nexhorts them to take up arms in behalf of the general freedom, and\r\nhaving assembled great forces he drives from the state his opponents, by\r\nwhom he had been expelled a short time previously. He is saluted king by\r\nhis partisans; he sends ambassadors in every direction, he conjures them\r\nto adhere firmly to their promise. He quickly attaches to his interests\r\nthe Senones, Parisii, Pictones, Cadurci, Turones, Aulerci, Lemovice, and\r\nall the others who border on the ocean; the supreme command is conferred\r\non him by unanimous consent. On obtaining this authority, he demands\r\nhostages from all these states, he orders a fixed number of soldiers to\r\nbe sent to him immediately; he determines what quantity of arms each\r\nstate shall prepare at home, and before what time; he pays particular\r\nattention to the cavalry. To the utmost vigilance he adds the utmost\r\nrigour of authority; and by the severity of his punishments brings over\r\nthe wavering: for on the commission of a greater crime he puts the\r\nperpetrators to death by fire and every sort of tortures; for a slighter\r\ncause, he sends home the offenders with their ears cut off, or one of\r\ntheir eyes put out, that they may be an example to the rest, and\r\nfrighten others by the severity of their punishment.\r\n\r\nV.--Having quickly collected an army by their punishments, he sends\r\nLucterius, one of the Cadurci, a man of the utmost daring, with part of\r\nhis forces, into the territory of the Ruteni; and marches in person into\r\nthe country of the Bituriges. On his arrival, the Bituriges send\r\nambassadors to the Aedui, under whose protection they were, to solicit\r\naid in order that they might more easily resist the forces of the enemy.\r\nThe Aedui, by the advice of the lieutenants whom Caesar had left with\r\nthe army, send supplies of horse and foot to succour the Bituriges. When\r\nthey came to the river Loire, which separates the Bituriges from the\r\nAedui, they delayed a few days there, and, not daring to pass the river,\r\nreturn home, and send back word to the lieutenants that they had\r\nreturned through fear of the treachery of the Bituriges, who, they\r\nascertained, had formed this design, that if the Aedui should cross the\r\nriver, the Bituriges on the one side, and the Arverni on the other,\r\nshould surround them. Whether they did this for the reason which they\r\nalleged to the lieutenants, or influenced by treachery, we think that we\r\nought not to state as certain, because we have no proof. On their\r\ndeparture, the Bituriges immediately unite themselves to the Arverni.\r\n\r\nVI.--These affairs being announced to Caesar in Italy at the time when\r\nhe understood that matters in the city had been reduced to a more\r\ntranquil state by the energy of Cneius Pompey, he set out for\r\nTransalpine Gaul. After he had arrived there, he was greatly at a loss\r\nto know by what means he could reach his army. For if he should summon\r\nthe legions into the province, he was aware that on their march they\r\nwould have to fight in his absence; he foresaw too, that if he himself\r\nshould endeavour to reach the army, he would act injudiciously, in\r\ntrusting his safety even to those who seemed to be tranquillized.\r\n\r\nVII.--In the meantime Lucterius the Cadurcan, having been sent into the\r\ncountry of the Ruteni, gains over that state to the Arverni. Having\r\nadvanced into the country of the Nitiobriges, and Gabali, he receives\r\nhostages from both nations, and, assembling a numerous force, marches to\r\nmake a descent on the province in the direction of Narbo. Caesar, when\r\nthis circumstance was announced to him, thought that the march to Narbo\r\nought to take the precedence of all his other plans. When he arrived\r\nthere, he encourages the timid, and stations garrisons among the Ruteni,\r\nin the province of the Volcae Arecomici, and the country around Narbo\r\nwhich was in the vicinity of the enemy; he orders a portion of the\r\nforces from the province, and the recruits which he had brought from\r\nItaly, to rendezvous among the Helvii who border on the territories of\r\nthe Arverni.\r\n\r\nVIII.--These matters being arranged, and Lucterius now checked and\r\nforced to retreat, because he thought it dangerous to enter the line of\r\nRoman garrisons, Caesar marches into the country of the Helvii; although\r\nmount Cevennes, which separates the Arverni from the Helvii, blocked up\r\nthe way with very deep snow, as it was the severest season of the year;\r\nyet having cleared away the snow to the depth of six feet, and having\r\nopened the roads, he reaches the territories of the Arverni, with\r\ninfinite labour to his soldiers. This people being surprised, because\r\nthey considered themselves defended by the Cevennes as by a wall, and\r\nthe paths at this season of the year had never before been passable even\r\nto individuals, he orders the cavalry to extend themselves as far as\r\nthey could, and strike as great a panic as possible into the enemy.\r\nThese proceedings are speedily announced to Vercingetorix by rumour and\r\nhis messengers. Around him all the Arverni crowd in alarm, and solemnly\r\nentreat him to protect their property, and not to suffer them to be\r\nplundered by the enemy, especially as he saw that all the war was\r\ntransferred into their country. Being prevailed upon by their entreaties\r\nhe moves his camp from the country of the Bituriges in the direction of\r\nthe Arverni.\r\n\r\nIX.--Caesar, having delayed two days in that place, because he had\r\nanticipated that, in the natural course of events, such would be the\r\nconduct of Vercingetorix, leaves the army under pretence of raising\r\nrecruits and cavalry: he places Brutus, a young man, in command of these\r\nforces; he gives him instructions that the cavalry should range as\r\nextensively as possible in all directions; that he would exert himself\r\nnot to be absent from the camp longer than three days. Having arranged\r\nthese matters, he marches to Vienna by as long journeys as he can, when\r\nhis own soldiers did not expect him. Finding there a fresh body of\r\ncavalry, which he had sent on to that place several days before,\r\nmarching incessantly night and day, he advanced rapidly through the\r\nterritory of the Aedui into that of the Lingones, in which two legions\r\nwere wintering, that, if any plan affecting his own safety should have\r\nbeen organised by the Aedui, he might defeat it by the rapidity of his\r\nmovements. When he arrived there, he sends information to the rest of\r\nthe legions, and gathers all his army into one place before intelligence\r\nof his arrival could be announced to the Arverni.\r\n\r\nVercingetorix, on hearing this circumstance, leads back his army into\r\nthe country of the Bituriges; and after marching from it to Gergovia, a\r\ntown of the Boii, whom Caesar had settled there after defeating them in\r\nthe Helvetian war, and had rendered tributary to the Aedui, he\r\ndetermined to attack it.\r\n\r\nX.--This action caused great perplexity to Caesar in the selection of\r\nhis plans; [he feared] lest, if he should confine his legions in one\r\nplace for the remaining portion of the winter, all Gaul should revolt\r\nwhen the tributaries of the Aedui were subdued, because it would appear\r\nthat there was in him no protection for his friends; but if he should\r\ndraw them too soon out of their winter quarters, he might be distressed\r\nby the want of provisions, in consequence of the difficulty of\r\nconveyance. It seemed better, however, to endure every hardship than to\r\nalienate the affections of all his allies, by submitting to such an\r\ninsult. Having, therefore, impressed on the Aedui the necessity of\r\nsupplying him with provisions, he sends forward messengers to the Boii\r\nto inform them of his arrival, and encourage them to remain firm in\r\ntheir allegiance, and resist the attack of the enemy with great\r\nresolution. Having left two legions and the luggage of the entire army\r\nat Agendicum, he marches to the Boii.\r\n\r\nXI.--On the second day, when he came to Vellaunodunum, a town of the\r\nSenones, he determined to attack it, in order that he might not leave an\r\nenemy in his rear, and might the more easily procure supplies of\r\nprovisions, and drew a line of circumvallation around it in two days: on\r\nthe third day, ambassadors being sent from the town to treat of a\r\ncapitulation, he orders their arms to be brought together, their cattle\r\nto be brought forth, and six hundred hostages to be given. He leaves\r\nCaius Trebonius, his lieutenant, to complete these arrangements; he\r\nhimself sets out with the intention of marching as soon as possible to\r\nGenabum, a town of the Carnutes, who having then for the first time\r\nreceived information of the siege of Vellaunodunum, as they thought that\r\nit would be protracted to a longer time, were preparing a garrison to\r\nsend to Genabum for the defence of that town. Caesar arrived here in two\r\ndays; after pitching his camp before the town, being prevented by the\r\ntime of the day, he defers the attack to the next day, and orders his\r\nsoldiers to prepare whatever was necessary for that enterprise; and as a\r\nbridge over the Loire connected the town of Genabum with the opposite\r\nbank, fearing lest the inhabitants should escape by night from the town,\r\nhe orders two legions to keep watch under arms. The people of Genabum\r\ncame forth silently from the city before midnight, and began to cross\r\nthe river. When this circumstance was announced by scouts, Caesar,\r\nhaving set fire to the gates, sends in the legions which he had ordered\r\nto be ready, and obtains possession of the town so completely, that very\r\nfew of the whole number of the enemy escaped being taken alive, because\r\nthe narrowness of the bridge and the roads prevented the multitude from\r\nescaping. He pillages and burns the town, gives the booty to the\r\nsoldiers, then leads his army over the Loire, and marches into the\r\nterritories of the Bituriges.\r\n\r\nXII.--Vercingetorix, when he ascertained the arrival of Caesar, desisted\r\nfrom the siege [of Gergovia], and marched to meet Caesar. The latter had\r\ncommenced to besiege Noviodunum; and when ambassadors came from this\r\ntown to beg that he would pardon them and spare their lives, in order\r\nthat he might execute the rest of his designs with the rapidity by which\r\nhe had accomplished most of them, he orders their arms to be collected,\r\ntheir horses to be brought forth, and hostages to be given. A part of\r\nthe hostages being now delivered up, when the rest of the terms were\r\nbeing performed, a few centurions and soldiers being sent into the town\r\nto collect the arms and horses, the enemy's cavalry, which had\r\noutstripped the main body of Vercingetorix's army, was seen at a\r\ndistance; as soon as the townsmen beheld them, and entertained hopes of\r\nassistance, raising a shout, they began to take up arms, shut the gates,\r\nand line the walls. When the centurions in the town understood from the\r\nsignal-making of the Gauls that they were forming some new design, they\r\ndrew their swords and seized the gates, and recovered all their men\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\nXIII.--Caesar orders the horse to be drawn out of the camp, and\r\ncommences a cavalry action. His men being now distressed, Caesar sends\r\nto their aid about four hundred German horse, which he had determined,\r\nat the beginning, to keep with himself. The Gauls could not withstand\r\ntheir attack, but were put to flight, and retreated to their main body,\r\nafter losing a great number of men. When they were routed, the townsmen,\r\nagain intimidated, arrested those persons by whose exertions they\r\nthought that the mob had been roused, and brought them to Caesar, and\r\nsurrendered themselves to him. When these affairs were accomplished,\r\nCaesar marched to the Avaricum, which was the largest and best fortified\r\ntown in the territories of the Bituriges, and situated in a most fertile\r\ntract of country; because he confidently expected that on taking that\r\ntown, he would reduce beneath his dominion the state of the Bituriges.\r\n\r\nXIV.--Vercingetorix, after sustaining such a series of losses at\r\nVellaunodunum, Genabum, and Noviodunum, summons his men to a council. He\r\nimpresses on them \"that the war must be prosecuted on a very different\r\nsystem from that which had been previously adopted; but they should by\r\nall means aim at this object, that the Romans should be prevented from\r\nforaging and procuring provisions; that this was easy, because they\r\nthemselves were well supplied with cavalry and were likewise assisted by\r\nthe season of the year; that forage could not be cut; that the enemy\r\nmust necessarily disperse, and look for it in the houses, that all these\r\nmight be daily destroyed by the horse. Besides that the interests of\r\nprivate property must be neglected for the sake of the general safety;\r\nthat the villages and houses ought to be fired, over such an extent of\r\ncountry in every direction from Boia, as the Romans appeared capable of\r\nscouring in their search for forage. That an abundance of these\r\nnecessaries could be supplied to them, because they would be assisted by\r\nthe resources of those in whose territories the war would be waged: that\r\nthe Romans either would not bear the privation, or else would advance to\r\nany distance from the camp with considerable danger; and that it made no\r\ndifference whether they slew them or stripped them of their baggage,\r\nsince, if it was lost, they could not carry on the war. Besides that,\r\nthe towns ought to be burnt which were not secured against every danger\r\nby their fortifications or natural advantages; that there should not be\r\nplaces of retreat for their own countrymen for declining military\r\nservice, nor be exposed to the Romans as inducements to carry off\r\nabundance of provisions and plunder. If these sacrifices should appear\r\nheavy or galling, that they ought to consider it much more distressing\r\nthat their wives and children should be dragged off to slavery, and\r\nthemselves slain; the evils which must necessarily befall the conquered.\r\n\r\nXV.--This opinion having been approved of by unanimous consent, more\r\nthan twenty towns of the Bituriges are burnt in one day. Conflagrations\r\nare beheld in every quarter; and although all bore this with great\r\nregret, yet they laid before themselves this consolation, that, as the\r\nvictory was certain, they could quickly recover their losses. There is a\r\ndebate concerning Avaricum in the general council, whether they should\r\ndecide that it should be burnt or defended. The Bituriges threw\r\nthemselves at the feet of all the Gauls, and entreat that they should\r\nnot be compelled to set fire with their own hands to the fairest city of\r\nalmost the whole of Gaul, which was both a protection and ornament to\r\nthe state; they say that \"they could easily defend it, owing to the\r\nnature of the ground, for, being enclosed almost on every side by a\r\nriver and a marsh, it had only one entrance, and that very narrow.\"\r\nPermission being granted to them at their earnest request, Vercingetorix\r\nat first dissuades them from it, but afterwards concedes the point,\r\nowing to their entreaties and the compassion of the soldiers. A proper\r\ngarrison is selected for the town.\r\n\r\nXVI.--Vercingetorix follows closely upon Caesar by shorter marches, and\r\nselects for his camp a place defended by woods and marshes, at the\r\ndistance of fifteen miles from Avaricum. There he received intelligence\r\nby trusty scouts, every hour in the day, of what was going on at\r\nAvaricum, and ordered whatever he wished to be done; he closely watched\r\nall our expeditions for corn and forage, and whenever they were\r\ncompelled to go to a greater distance, he attacked them when dispersed,\r\nand inflicted severe loss upon them; although the evil was remedied by\r\nour men, as far as precautions could be taken, by going forth at\r\nirregular times, and by different ways.\r\n\r\nXVII.--Caesar pitching his camp at that side of the town which was not\r\ndefended by the river and marsh, and had a very narrow approach, as we\r\nhave mentioned, began to raise the vineae and erect two towers; for the\r\nnature of the place prevented him from drawing a line of\r\ncircumvallation. He never ceased to importune the Boii and Aedui for\r\nsupplies of corn; of whom the one [the Aedui], because they were acting\r\nwith no zeal, did not aid him much; the others [the Boii], as their\r\nresources were not great, quickly consumed what they had. Although the\r\narmy was distressed by the greatest want of corn, through the poverty of\r\nthe Boii, the apathy of the Aedui, and the burning of the houses, to\r\nsuch a degree, that for several days the soldiers were without corn, and\r\nsatisfied their extreme hunger with cattle driven from the remote\r\nvillages; yet no language was heard from them unworthy of the majesty of\r\nthe Roman people and their former victories. Moreover, when Caesar\r\naddressed the legions, one by one, when at work, and said that he would\r\nraise the siege, if they felt the scarcity too severely, they\r\nunanimously begged him \"not to do so; that they had served for several\r\nyears under his command in such a manner, that they never submitted to\r\ninsult, and never abandoned an enterprise without accomplishing it; that\r\nthey should consider it a disgrace if they abandoned the siege after\r\ncommencing it; that it was better to endure every hardship than not to\r\navenge the manes of the Roman citizens who perished at Genabum by the\r\nperfidy of the Gauls.\" They entrusted the same declarations to the\r\ncenturions and military tribunes, that through them they might be\r\ncommunicated to Caesar.\r\n\r\nXVIII.--When the towers had now approached the walls, Caesar ascertained\r\nfrom the captives that Vercingetorix, after destroying the forage, had\r\npitched his camp nearer Avaricum, and that he himself with the cavalry\r\nand light-armed infantry, who generally fought among the horse, had gone\r\nto lay an ambuscade in that quarter to which he thought that our troops\r\nwould come the next day to forage. On learning these facts, he set out\r\nfrom the camp secretly at midnight, and reached the camp of the enemy\r\nearly in the morning. They having quickly learned the arrival of Caesar\r\nby scouts, hid their cars and baggage in the thickest parts of the\r\nwoods, and drew up all their forces in a lofty and open space: which\r\ncircumstance being announced, Caesar immediately ordered the baggage to\r\nbe piled, and the arms to be got ready.\r\n\r\nXIX.--There was a hill of a gentle ascent from the bottom; a dangerous\r\nand impassable marsh, not more than fifty feet broad, begirt it on\r\nalmost every side. The Gauls, having broken down the bridges, posted\r\nthemselves on this hill, in confidence of their position, and being\r\ndrawn up in tribes according to their respective states, held all the\r\nfords and passages of that marsh with trusty guards, thus determined\r\nthat if the Romans should attempt to force the marsh, they would\r\noverpower them from the higher ground while sticking in it, so that\r\nwhoever saw the nearness of the position, would imagine that the two\r\narmies were prepared to fight on almost equal terms; but whoever should\r\nview accurately the disadvantage of position, would discover that they\r\nwere showing off an empty affectation of courage. Caesar clearly points\r\nout to his soldiers, who were indignant that the enemy could bear the\r\nsight of them at the distance of so short a space, and were earnestly\r\ndemanding the signal for action, \"with how great loss and the death of\r\nhow many gallant men the victory would necessarily be purchased: and\r\nwhen he saw them so determined to decline no danger for his renown, that\r\nhe ought to be considered guilty of the utmost injustice if he did not\r\nhold their life dearer than his own personal safety.\" Having thus\r\nconsoled his soldiers, he leads them back on the same day to the camp,\r\nand determined to prepare the other things which were necessary for the\r\nsiege of the town.\r\n\r\nXX.--Vercingetorix, when he had returned to his men, was accused of\r\ntreason, in that he had moved his camp nearer the Romans, in that he had\r\ngone away with all the cavalry, in that he had left so great forces\r\nwithout a commander, in that, on his departure, the Romans had come at\r\nsuch a favourable season, and with such despatch; that all these\r\ncircumstances could not have happened accidentally or without design;\r\nthat he preferred holding the sovereignty of Gaul by the grant of\r\nCaesar, to acquiring it by their favour. Being accused in such a manner,\r\nhe made the following reply to these charges:--\"That his moving his camp\r\nhad been caused by want of forage, and had been done even by their\r\nadvice; that his approaching near the Romans had been a measure dictated\r\nby the favourable nature of the ground, which would defend him by its\r\nnatural strength; that the service of the cavalry could not have been\r\nrequisite in marshy ground, and was useful in that place to which they\r\nhad gone; that he, on his departure, had given the supreme command to no\r\none intentionally, lest he should be induced by the eagerness of the\r\nmultitude to hazard an engagement, to which he perceived that all were\r\ninclined, owing to their want of energy, because they were unable to\r\nendure fatigue any longer. That, if the Romans in the meantime came up\r\nby chance, they [the Gauls] should feel grateful to fortune; if invited\r\nby the information of some one they should feel grateful to him, because\r\nthey were enabled to see distinctly from the higher ground the smallness\r\nof the number of their enemy, and despise the courage of those who, not\r\ndaring to fight, retreated disgracefully into their camp. That he\r\ndesired no power from Caesar by treachery, since he could have it by\r\nvictory, which was now assured to himself and to all the Gauls; nay,\r\nthat he would even give them back the command, if they thought that they\r\nconferred honour on him, rather then received safety from him. That you\r\nmay be assured,\" said he, \"that I speak these words with truth;--listen\r\nto these Roman soldiers!\" He produces some camp-followers whom he had\r\nsurprised on a foraging expedition some days before, and had tortured by\r\nfamine and confinement. They being previously instructed in what answers\r\nthey should make when examined, say, \"That they were legionary soldiers,\r\nthat, urged by famine and want, they had recently gone forth from the\r\ncamp, [to see] if they could find any corn or cattle in the fields; that\r\nthe whole army was distressed by a similar scarcity, nor had any one now\r\nsufficient strength, nor could bear the labour of the work; and\r\ntherefore that the general was determined, if he made no progress in the\r\nsiege, to draw off his army in three days.\" \"These benefits,\" says\r\nVercingetorix, \"you receive from me, whom you accuse of treason--me, by\r\nwhose exertions you see so powerful and victorious an army almost\r\ndestroyed by famine, without shedding one drop of your blood; and I have\r\ntaken precautions that no state shall admit within its territories this\r\narmy in its ignominious flight from this place.\"\r\n\r\nXXI.--The whole multitude raise a shout and clash their arms, according\r\nto their custom, as they usually do in the case of him whose speech they\r\napprove; [they exclaim] that Vercingetorix was a consummate general, and\r\nthat they had no doubt of his honour; that the war could not be\r\nconducted with greater prudence. They determine that ten thousand men\r\nshould be picked out of the entire army and sent into the town, and\r\ndecide that the general safety should not be entrusted to the Bituriges\r\nalone, because they were aware that the glory of the victory must rest\r\nwith the Bituriges, if they made good the defence of the town.\r\n\r\nXXII.--To the extraordinary valour of our soldiers, devices of every\r\nsort were opposed by the Gauls; since they are a nation of consummate\r\ningenuity, and most skilful in imitating and making those things which\r\nare imparted by any one; for they turned aside the hooks with nooses,\r\nand when they had caught hold of them firmly, drew them on by means of\r\nengines, and undermined the mound the more skilfully on this account,\r\nbecause there are in their territories extensive iron mines, and\r\nconsequently every description of mining operations is known and\r\npractised by them. They had furnished, moreover, the whole wall on every\r\nside with turrets, and had covered them with skins. Besides, in their\r\nfrequent sallies by day and night, they attempted either to set fire to\r\nthe mound, or attack our soldiers when engaged in the works; and,\r\nmoreover, by splicing the upright timbers of their own towers, they\r\nequalled the height of ours, as fast as the mound had daily raised them,\r\nand countermined our mines, and impeded the working of them by stakes\r\nbent and sharpened at the ends, and boiling pitch, and stones of very\r\ngreat weight, and prevented them from approaching the walls.\r\n\r\nXXIII.--But this is usually the form of all the Gallic walls. Straight\r\nbeams, connected lengthwise and two feet distant from each other at\r\nequal intervals, are placed together on the ground; these are mortised\r\non the inside, and covered with plenty of earth. But the intervals which\r\nwe have mentioned, are closed up in front by large stones. These being\r\nthus laid and cemented together, another row is added above, in such a\r\nmanner that the same interval may be observed, and that the beams may\r\nnot touch one another, but equal spaces intervening, each row of beams\r\nis kept firmly in its place by a row of stones. In this manner the whole\r\nwall is consolidated, until the regular height of the wall be completed.\r\nThis work, with respect to appearance and variety, is not unsightly,\r\nowing to the alternate rows of beams and stones, which preserve their\r\norder in right lines; and, besides, it possesses great advantages as\r\nregards utility and the defence of cities; for the stone protects it\r\nfrom fire, and the wood from the battering ram, since it [the wood]\r\nbeing mortised in the inside with rows of beams, generally forty feet\r\neach in length, can neither be broken through nor torn asunder.\r\n\r\nXXIV.--The siege having been impeded by so many disadvantages, the\r\nsoldiers, although they were retarded during the whole time, by the mud,\r\ncold, and constant showers, yet by their incessant labour overcame all\r\nthese obstacles, and in twenty-five days raised a mound three hundred\r\nand thirty feet broad and eighty feet high. When it almost touched the\r\nenemy's walls, and Caesar, according to his usual custom, kept watch at\r\nthe work, and encouraged the soldiers not to discontinue the work for a\r\nmoment: a little before the third watch they discovered that the mound\r\nwas sinking, since the enemy had set it on fire by a mine; and at the\r\nsame time a shout was raised along the entire wall, and a sally was made\r\nfrom two gates on each side of the turrets. Some at a distance were\r\ncasting torches and dry wood from the wall on the mound, others were\r\npouring on it pitch, and other materials, by which the flame might be\r\nexcited, so that a plan could hardly be formed, as to where they should\r\nfirst run to the defence, or to what part aid should be brought.\r\nHowever, as two legions always kept guard before the camp by Caesar's\r\norders, and several of them were at stated times at the work, measures\r\nwere promptly taken, that some should oppose the sallying party, others\r\ndraw back the towers and make a cut in the rampart; and moreover, that\r\nthe whole army should hasten from the camp to extinguish the flames.\r\n\r\nXXV.--When the battle was going on in every direction, the rest of the\r\nnight being now spent, and fresh hopes of victory always arose before\r\nthe enemy: the more so on this account because they saw the coverings of\r\nour towers burnt away, and perceived that we, being exposed, could not\r\neasily go to give assistance, and they themselves were always relieving\r\nthe weary with fresh men, and considered that all the safety of Gaul\r\nrested on this crisis; there happened in my own view a circumstance\r\nwhich, having appeared to be worthy of record, we thought it ought not\r\nto be omitted. A certain Gaul before the gate of the town, who was\r\ncasting into the fire opposite the turret balls of tallow and fire which\r\nwere passed along to him, was pierced with a dart on the right side and\r\nfell dead. One of those next him stepped over him as he lay, and\r\ndischarged the same office: when the second man was slain in the same\r\nmanner by a wound from a cross-bow, a third succeeded him, and a fourth\r\nsucceeded the third: nor was this post left vacant by the besieged,\r\nuntil, the fire of the mound having been extinguished, and the enemy\r\nrepulsed in every direction, an end was put to the fighting.\r\n\r\nXXVI.--The Gauls having tried every expedient, as nothing had succeeded,\r\nadopted the design of fleeing from the town the next day, by the advice\r\nand order of Vercingetorix. They hoped that, by attempting it at the\r\ndead of night, they would effect it without any great loss of men,\r\nbecause the camp of Vercingetorix was not far distant from the town, and\r\nthe extensive marsh which intervened was likely to retard the Romans in\r\nthe pursuit. And they were now preparing to execute this by night, when\r\nthe matrons suddenly ran out into the streets, and weeping cast\r\nthemselves at the feet of their husbands, and requested of them, with\r\nevery entreaty, that they should not abandon themselves and their common\r\nchildren to the enemy for punishment, because the weakness of their\r\nnature and physical powers prevented them from taking to flight. When\r\nthey saw that they (as fear does not generally admit of mercy in extreme\r\ndanger) persisted in their resolution, they began to shout aloud, and\r\ngive intelligence of their flight to the Romans. The Gauls being\r\nintimidated by fear of this, lest the passes should be pre-occupied by\r\nthe Roman cavalry, desisted from their design.\r\n\r\nXXVII.--The next day Caesar, the tower being advanced, and the works\r\nwhich he had determined to raise being arranged, a violent storm\r\narising, thought this no bad time for executing his designs, because he\r\nobserved the guards arranged on the walls a little too negligently, and\r\ntherefore ordered his own men to engage in their work more remissly, and\r\npointed out what he wished to be done. He drew up his soldiers in a\r\nsecret position within the vineae, and exhorts them to reap, at least,\r\nthe harvest of victory proportionate to their exertions. He proposed a\r\nreward for those who should first scale the walls, and gave the signal\r\nto the soldiers. They suddenly flew out from all quarters and quickly\r\nfilled the wall.\r\n\r\nXXVIII.--The enemy being alarmed by the suddenness of the attack, were\r\ndislodged from the wall and towers, and drew up, in form of a wedge, in\r\nthe market-place and the open streets, with this intention that, if an\r\nattack should be made on any side, they should fight with their line\r\ndrawn up to receive it. When they saw no one descending to the level\r\nground, and the enemy extending themselves along the entire wall in\r\nevery direction, fearing lest every hope of flight should be cut off,\r\nthey cast away their arms, and sought, without stopping, the most remote\r\nparts of the town. A part was then slain by the infantry when they were\r\ncrowding upon one another in the narrow passage of the gates; and a part\r\nhaving got without the gates, were cut to pieces by the cavalry: nor was\r\nthere one who was anxious for the plunder. Thus, being excited by the\r\nmassacre at Genabum and the fatigue of the siege, they spared neither\r\nthose worn out with years, women, or children. Finally, out of all that\r\nnumber, which amounted to about forty thousand, scarcely eight hundred,\r\nwho fled from the town when they heard the first alarm, reached\r\nVercingetorix in safety: and he, the night being now far spent, received\r\nthem in silence after their flight (fearing that any sedition should\r\narise in the camp from their entrance in a body and the compassion of\r\nthe soldiers), so that, having arranged his friends and the chiefs of\r\nthe states at a distance on the road, he took precautions that they\r\nshould be separated and conducted to their fellow countrymen, to\r\nwhatever part of the camp had been assigned to each state from the\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nXXIX.--Vercingetorix having convened an assembly on the following day,\r\nconsoled and encouraged his soldiers in the following words:--\"That they\r\nshould not be too much depressed in spirit, nor alarmed at their loss;\r\nthat the Romans did not conquer by valour nor in the field, but by a\r\nkind of art and skill in assault, with which they themselves were\r\nunacquainted; that whoever expected every event in the war to be\r\nfavourable, erred; that it never was his opinion that Avaricum should be\r\ndefended, of the truth of which statement he had themselves as\r\nwitnesses, but that it was owing to the imprudence of the Bituriges, and\r\nthe too ready compliance of the rest, that this loss was sustained;\r\nthat, however, he would soon compensate it by superior advantages; for\r\nthat he would, by his exertions, bring over those states which severed\r\nthemselves from the rest of the Gauls, and would create a general\r\nunanimity throughout the whole of Gaul, the union of which not even the\r\nwhole earth could withstand, and that he had it already almost effected;\r\nthat in the meantime it was reasonable that he should prevail on them,\r\nfor the sake of the general safety, to begin to fortify their camp, in\r\norder that they might the more easily sustain the sudden attacks of the\r\nenemy.\"\r\n\r\nXXX.--This speech was not disagreeable to the Gauls, principally,\r\nbecause he himself was not disheartened by receiving so severe a loss,\r\nand had not concealed himself, nor shunned the eyes of the people: and\r\nhe was believed to possess greater foresight and sounder judgment than\r\nthe rest, because, when the affair was undecided, he had at first been\r\nof opinion that Avaricum should be burnt, and afterwards that it should\r\nbe abandoned. Accordingly, as ill success weakens the authority of other\r\ngenerals, so, on the contrary, his dignity increased daily, although a\r\nloss was sustained: at the same time they began to entertain hopes, on\r\nhis assertion, of uniting the rest of the states to themselves, and on\r\nthis occasion, for the first time, the Gauls began to fortify their\r\ncamps, and were so alarmed that although they were men unaccustomed to\r\ntoil, yet they were of opinion that they ought to endure and suffer\r\neverything which should be imposed upon them.\r\n\r\nXXXI.--Nor did Vercingetorix use less efforts than he had promised, to\r\ngain over the other states, and [in consequence] endeavoured to entice\r\ntheir leaders by gifts and promises. For this object he selected fitting\r\nemissaries by whose subtle pleading or private friendship each of the\r\nnobles could be most easily influenced. He takes care that those who\r\nfled to him on the storming of Avaricum should be provided with arms and\r\nclothes. At the same time, that his diminished forces should be\r\nrecruited, he levies a fixed quota of soldiers from each state, and\r\ndefines the number and day before which he should wish them brought to\r\nthe camp, and orders all the archers, of whom there was a very great\r\nnumber in Gaul, to be collected and sent to him. By these means, the\r\ntroops which were lost at Avaricum are speedily replaced. In the\r\nmeantime, Teutomarus, the son of Ollovicon, the king of the Nitiobriges,\r\nwhose father had received the appellation of friend from our senate,\r\ncame to him with a great number of his own horse and those whom he had\r\nhired from Aquitania.\r\n\r\nXXXII.--Caesar, after delaying several days at Avaricum, and finding\r\nthere the greatest plenty of corn and other provisions, refreshed his\r\narmy after their fatigue and privation. The winter being almost ended,\r\nwhen he was invited by the favourable season of the year to prosecute\r\nthe war and march against the enemy, [and try] whether he could draw\r\nthem from the marshes and woods, or else press them by a blockade; some\r\nnoblemen of the Aedui came to him as ambassadors to entreat \"that in an\r\nextreme emergency he should succour their state; that their affairs were\r\nin the utmost danger, because, whereas single magistrates had been\r\nusually appointed in ancient times and held the power of king for a\r\nsingle year, two persons now exercised this office, and each asserted\r\nthat he was appointed according to their laws. That one of them was\r\nConvictolitanis, a powerful and illustrious youth; the other Cotus,\r\nsprung from a most ancient family, and personally a man of very great\r\ninfluence and extensive connections. His brother Valetiacus had borne\r\nthe same office during the last year: that the whole state was up in\r\narms; the senate divided, the people divided; that each of them had his\r\nown adherents; and that, if the animosity would be fomented any longer\r\nthe result would be that one part of the state would come to a collision\r\nwith the other; that it rested with his activity and influence to\r\nprevent it.\"\r\n\r\nXXXIII.--Although Caesar considered it ruinous to leave the war and the\r\nenemy, yet, being well aware what great evils generally arise from\r\ninternal dissensions, lest a state so powerful and so closely connected\r\nwith the Roman people, which he himself had always fostered and honoured\r\nin every respect, should have recourse to violence and arms, and that\r\nthe party which had less confidence in its own power should summon aid\r\nfrom Vercingetorix, he determined to anticipate this movement; and\r\nbecause, by the laws of the Aedui, it was not permitted those who held\r\nthe supreme authority to leave the country, he determined to go in\r\nperson to the Aedui, lest he should appear to infringe upon their\r\ngovernment and laws, and summoned all the senate, and those between whom\r\nthe dispute was, to meet him at Decetia. When almost all the state had\r\nassembled there, and he was informed that one brother had been declared\r\nmagistrate by the other, when only a few persons were privately summoned\r\nfor the purpose, at a different time and place from what he ought,\r\nwhereas the laws not only forbade two belonging to one family to be\r\nelected magistrates while each was alive, but even deterred them from\r\nbeing in the senate, he compelled Cotus to resign his office; he ordered\r\nConvictolitanis, who had been elected by the priests, according to the\r\nusage of the state, in the presence of the magistrates, to hold the\r\nsupreme authority.\r\n\r\nXXXIV.--Having pronounced this decree between [the contending parties],\r\nhe exhorted the Aedui to bury in oblivion their disputes and\r\ndissensions, and, laying aside all these things, devote themselves to\r\nthe war, and expect from him, on the conquest of Gaul, those rewards\r\nwhich they should have earned, and send speedily to him all their\r\ncavalry and ten thousand infantry, which he might place in different\r\ngarrisons to protect his convoys of provisions, and then divided his\r\narmy into two parts: he gave Labienus four legions to lead into the\r\ncountry of the Senones and Parisii; and led in person six into the\r\ncountry of the Arverni, in the direction of the town of Gergovia, along\r\nthe banks of the Allier. He gave part of the cavalry to Labienus, and\r\nkept part to himself. Vercingetorix, on learning this circumstance,\r\nbroke down all the bridges over the river and began to march on the\r\nother bank of the Allier.\r\n\r\nXXXV.--When each army was in sight of the other, and was pitching their\r\ncamp almost opposite that of the enemy, scouts being distributed in\r\nevery quarter, lest the Romans should build a bridge and bring over\r\ntheir troops; it was to Caesar a matter attended with great\r\ndifficulties, lest he should be hindered from passing the river during\r\nthe greater part of the summer, as the Allier cannot generally be forded\r\nbefore the autumn. Therefore, that this might not happen, having pitched\r\nhis camp in a woody place opposite to one of those bridges which\r\nVercingetorix had taken care should be broken down, the next day he\r\nstopped behind with two legions in a secret place: he sent on the rest\r\nof the forces as usual, with all the baggage, after having selected some\r\ncohorts, that the number of the legions might appear to be complete.\r\nHaving ordered these to advance as far as they could, when now, from the\r\ntime of day, he conjectured they had come to an encampment, he began to\r\nrebuild the bridge on the same piles, the lower part of which remained\r\nentire. Having quickly finished the work and led his legions across, he\r\nselected a fit place for a camp, and recalled the rest of his troops.\r\nVercingetorix, on ascertaining this fact, went before him by forced\r\nmarches, in order that he might not be compelled to come to an action\r\nagainst his will.\r\n\r\nXXXVI.--Caesar, in five days' march, went from that place to Gergovia,\r\nand after engaging in a slight cavalry skirmish that day, on viewing the\r\nsituation of the city, which, being built on a very high mountain, was\r\nvery difficult of access, he despaired of taking it by storm, and\r\ndetermined to take no measures with regard to besieging it before he\r\nshould secure a supply of provisions. But Vercingetorix, having pitched\r\nhis camp on the mountain near the town, placed the forces of each state\r\nseparately and at small intervals around himself, and having occupied\r\nall the hills of that range as far as they commanded a view [of the\r\nRoman encampment], he presented a formidable appearance; he ordered the\r\nrulers of the states, whom he had selected as his council of war, to\r\ncome to him daily at the dawn, whether any measure seemed to require\r\ndeliberation or execution. Nor did he allow almost any day to pass\r\nwithout testing in a cavalry action, the archers being intermixed, what\r\nspirit and valour there was in each of his own men. There was a hill\r\nopposite the town, at the very foot of that mountain, strongly fortified\r\nand precipitous on every side (which if our men could gain, they seemed\r\nlikely to exclude the enemy from a great share of their supply of water,\r\nand from free foraging; but this place was occupied by them with a weak\r\ngarrison): however, Caesar set out from the camp in the silence of\r\nnight, and dislodging the garrison before succour could come from the\r\ntown, he got possession of the place and posted two legions there, and\r\ndrew from the greater camp to the less a double trench twelve feet\r\nbroad, so that the soldiers could even singly pass secure from any\r\nsudden attack of the enemy.\r\n\r\nXXXVII.--Whilst these affairs were going on at Gergovia,\r\nConvictolitanis, the Aeduan, to whom we have observed the magistracy was\r\nadjudged by Caesar, being bribed by the Arverni, holds a conference with\r\ncertain young men, the chief of whom were Litavicus and his brothers,\r\nwho were born of a most noble family. He shares the bribe with them, and\r\nexhorts them to \"remember that they were free and born for empire; that\r\nthe state of the Aedui was the only one which retarded the most certain\r\nvictory of the Gauls; that the rest were held in check by its authority;\r\nand, if it was brought over, the Romans would not have room to stand on\r\nin Gaul; that he had received some kindness from Caesar, only so far,\r\nhowever, as gaining a most just cause by his decision; but that he\r\nassigned more weight to the general freedom; for, why should the Aedui\r\ngo to Caesar to decide concerning their rights and laws, rather than the\r\nRomans come to the Aedui?\" The young men being easily won over by the\r\nspeech of the magistrate and the bribe, when they declared that they\r\nwould even be leaders in the plot, a plan for accomplishing it was\r\nconsidered, because they were confident their state could not be induced\r\nto undertake the war on slight grounds. It was resolved that Litavicus\r\nshould have the command of the ten thousand which were being sent to\r\nCaesar for the war, and should have charge of them on their march, and\r\nthat his brothers should go before him to Caesar. They arrange the other\r\nmeasures, and the manner in which they should have them done.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII.--Litavicus, having received the command of the army, suddenly\r\nconvened the soldiers, when he was about thirty miles distant from\r\nGergovia, and, weeping, said, \"Soldiers, whither are we going? All our\r\nknights and all our nobles have perished. Eporedorix and Viridomarus,\r\nthe principal men of the state, being accused of treason, have been\r\nslain by the Romans without even permission to plead their cause. Learn\r\nthis intelligence from those who have escaped from the massacre; for I,\r\nsince my brothers and all my relations have been slain, am prevented by\r\ngrief from declaring what has taken place.\" Persons are brought forward\r\nwhom he had instructed in what he would have them say, and make the same\r\nstatements to the soldiery as Litavicus had made: that all the knights\r\nof the Aedui were slain because they were said to have held conferences\r\nwith the Arverni; that they had concealed themselves among the multitude\r\nof soldiers, and had escaped from the midst of the slaughter. The Aedui\r\nshout aloud and conjure Litavicus to provide for their safety. \"As if,\"\r\nsaid he, \"it were a matter of deliberation, and not of necessity, for us\r\nto go to Gergovia and unite ourselves to the Arverni. Or have we any\r\nreasons to doubt that the Romans, after perpetrating the atrocious\r\ncrime, are now hastening to slay us? Therefore, if there be any spirit\r\nin us, let us avenge the death of those who have perished in a most\r\nunworthy manner, and let us slay these robbers.\" He points to the Roman\r\ncitizens, who had accompanied them, in reliance on his protection. He\r\nimmediately seizes a great quantity of corn and provisions, cruelly\r\ntortures them, and then puts them to death, sends messengers throughout\r\nthe entire state of the Aedui, and rouses them completely by the same\r\nfalsehood concerning the slaughter of their knights and nobles; he\r\nearnestly advises them to avenge, in the same manner as he did, the\r\nwrongs which they had received.\r\n\r\nXXXIX.--Eporedorix, the Aeduan, a young man born in the highest rank and\r\npossessing very great influence at home, and, along with Viridomarus, of\r\nequal age and influence, but of inferior birth, whom Caesar had raised\r\nfrom a humble position to the highest rank, on being recommended to him\r\nby Divitiacus, had come in the number of horse, being summoned by Caesar\r\nby name. These had a dispute with each other for precedence, and in the\r\nstruggle between the magistrates they had contended with their utmost\r\nefforts, the one for Convictolitanis, the other for Cotus. Of these\r\nEporedorix, on learning the design of Litavicus, lays the matter before\r\nCaesar almost at midnight; he entreats that Caesar should not suffer\r\ntheir state to swerve from the alliance with the Roman people, owing to\r\nthe depraved counsels of a few young men, which he foresaw would be the\r\nconsequence if so many thousand men should unite themselves to the\r\nenemy, as their relations could not neglect their safety, nor the state\r\nregard it as a matter of slight importance.\r\n\r\nXL.--Caesar felt great anxiety on this intelligence, because he had\r\nalways especially indulged the state of the Aedui, and, without any\r\nhesitation, draws out from the camp four light-armed legions and all the\r\ncavalry: nor had he time, at such a crisis, to contract the camp,\r\nbecause the affair seemed to depend upon despatch. He leaves Caius\r\nFabius, his lieutenant, with two legions to guard the camp. When he\r\nordered the brothers of Litavicus to be arrested, he discovers that they\r\nhad fled a short time before to the camp of the enemy. He encouraged his\r\nsoldiers \"not to be disheartened by the labour of the journey on such a\r\nnecessary occasion,\" and, after advancing twenty-five miles, all being\r\nmost eager, he came in sight of the army of the Aedui, and, by sending\r\non his cavalry, retards and impedes their march; he then issues strict\r\norders to all his soldiers to kill no one. He commands Eporedorix and\r\nViridomarus, who they thought were killed, to move among the cavalry and\r\naddress their friends. When they were recognized and the treachery of\r\nLitavicus discovered, the Aedui began to extend their hands to intimate\r\nsubmission, and, laying down their arms, to deprecate death. Litavicus,\r\nwith his clansmen, who after the custom of the Gauls consider it a crime\r\nto desert their patrons, even in extreme misfortune, flees forth to\r\nGergovia.\r\n\r\nXLI.--Caesar, after sending messengers to the state of the Aedui, to\r\ninform them that they whom he could have put to death by the right of\r\nwar were spared through his kindness, and after giving three hours of\r\nthe night to his army for his repose, directed his march to Gergovia.\r\nAlmost in the middle of the journey, a party of horse that were sent by\r\nFabius stated in how great danger matters were; they inform him that the\r\ncamp was attacked by a very powerful army, while fresh men were\r\nfrequently relieving the wearied, and exhausting our soldiers by the\r\nincessant toil, since, on account of the size of the camp, they had\r\nconstantly to remain on the rampart; that many had been wounded by the\r\nimmense number of arrows and all kinds of missiles; that the engines\r\nwere of great service in withstanding them; that Fabius, at their\r\ndeparture, leaving only two gates open, was blocking up the rest, and\r\nwas adding breast-works to the ramparts, and was preparing himself for a\r\nsimilar casualty on the following day. Caesar, after receiving this\r\ninformation, reached the camp before sunrise owing to the very great\r\nzeal of his soldiers.\r\n\r\nXLII.--Whilst these things are going on at Gergovia, the Aedui, on\r\nreceiving the first announcements from Litavicus, leave themselves no\r\ntime to ascertain the truth of these statements. Some are stimulated by\r\navarice, others by revenge and credulity, which is an innate propensity\r\nin that race of men to such a degree that they consider a slight rumour\r\nas an ascertained fact. They plunder the property of the Roman citizens,\r\nand either massacre them or drag them away to slavery. Convictolitanis\r\nincreases the evil state of affairs, and goads on the people to fury,\r\nthat by the commission of some outrage they may be ashamed to return to\r\npropriety. They entice from the town of Cabillonus, by a promise of\r\nsafety, Marcus Aristius, a military tribune, who was on his march to his\r\nlegion; they compel those who had settled there for the purpose of\r\ntrading to do the same. By constantly attacking them on their march they\r\nstrip them of all their baggage; they besiege day and night those that\r\nresisted; when many were slain on both sides, they excite a greater\r\nnumber to arms.\r\n\r\nXLIII.--In the meantime, when intelligence was brought that all their\r\nsoldiers were in Caesar's power, they run in a body to Aristius; they\r\nassure him that nothing had been done by public authority; they order an\r\ninquiry to be made about the plundered property; they confiscate the\r\nproperty of Litavicus and his brothers; they send ambassadors to Caesar\r\nfor the purpose of clearing themselves. They do all this with a view to\r\nrecover their soldiers; but being contaminated by guilt, and charmed by\r\nthe gains arising from the plundered property, as that act was shared in\r\nby many, and being tempted by the fear of punishment, they began to form\r\nplans of war and stir up the other states by embassies. Although Caesar\r\nwas aware of this proceeding, yet he addresses the ambassadors with as\r\nmuch mildness as he can: \"That he did not think worse of the state on\r\naccount of the ignorance and fickleness of the mob, nor would diminish\r\nhis regard for the Aedui.\" He himself, fearing a greater commotion in\r\nGaul, in order to prevent his being surrounded by all the states, began\r\nto form plans as to the manner in which he should return from Gergovia\r\nand again concentrate his forces, lest a departure arising from the fear\r\nof a revolt should seem like a flight.\r\n\r\nXLIV.--Whilst he was considering these things an opportunity of acting\r\nsuccessfully seemed to offer. For, when he had come into the smaller\r\ncamp for the purpose of securing the works, he noticed that the hill in\r\nthe possession of the enemy was stript of men, although, on the former\r\ndays, it could scarcely be seen on account of the numbers on it. Being\r\nastonished, he inquires the reason of it from the deserters, a great\r\nnumber of whom flocked to him daily. They all concurred in asserting,\r\nwhat Caesar himself had already ascertained by his scouts, that the back\r\nof that hill was almost level; but likewise woody and narrow, by which\r\nthere was a pass to the other side of the town; that they had serious\r\napprehensions for this place, and had no other idea, on the occupation\r\nof one hill by the Romans, than that, if they should lose the other,\r\nthey would be almost surrounded, and cut off from all egress and\r\nforaging; that they were all summoned by Vercingetorix to fortify this\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nXLV.--Caesar, on being informed of this circumstance, sends several\r\ntroops of horse to the place immediately after midnight; he orders them\r\nto range in every quarter with more tumult than usual. At dawn he orders\r\na large quantity of baggage to be drawn out of the camp, and the\r\nmuleteers with helmets, in the appearance and guise of horsemen, to ride\r\nround the hills. To these he adds a few cavalry, with instructions to\r\nrange more widely to make a show. He orders them all to seek the same\r\nquarter by a long circuit; these proceedings were seen at a distance\r\nfrom the town, as Gergovia commanded a view of the camp, nor could the\r\nGauls ascertain at so great a distance what certainty there was in the\r\nmanoeuvre. He sends one legion to the same hill, and after it had\r\nmarched a little, stations it in the lower ground, and conceals it in\r\nthe woods. The suspicions of the Gauls are increased, and all their\r\nforces are marched to that place to defend it. Caesar, having perceived\r\nthe camp of the enemy deserted, covers the military insignia of his men,\r\nconceals the standards, and transfers his soldiers in small bodies from\r\nthe greater to the less camp, and points out to the lieutenants whom he\r\nhad placed in command over the respective legions, what he should wish\r\nto be done; he particularly advises them to restrain their men from\r\nadvancing too far, through their desire of fighting, or their hope of\r\nplunder; he sets before them what disadvantages the unfavourable nature\r\nof the ground carries with it; that they could be assisted by despatch\r\nalone: that success depended on a surprise, and not on a battle. After\r\nstating these particulars, he gives the signal for action, and detaches\r\nthe Aedui at the same time by another ascent an the right.\r\n\r\nXLVI.--The town wall was 1200 paces distant from the plain and foot of\r\nthe ascent, in a straight line, if no gap intervened; whatever circuit\r\nwas added to this ascent, to make the hill easy, increased the length of\r\nthe route. But almost in the middle of the hill, the Gauls had\r\npreviously built a wall six feet high, made of large stones, and\r\nextending in length as far as the nature of the ground permitted, as a\r\nbarrier to retard the advance of our men; and leaving all the lower\r\nspace empty, they had filled the upper part of the hill, as far as the\r\nwall of the town, with their camps very close to one another. The\r\nsoldiers, on the signal being given, quickly advance to this\r\nfortification, and passing over it, make themselves masters of the\r\nseparate camps. And so great was their activity in taking the camps,\r\nthat Teutomarus, the king of the Nitiobriges, being suddenly surprised\r\nin his tent, as he had gone to rest at noon, with difficulty escaped\r\nfrom the hands of the plunderers, with the upper part of his person\r\nnaked, and his horse wounded.\r\n\r\nXLVII.--Caesar, having accomplished the object which he had in view,\r\nordered the signal to be sounded for a retreat; and the soldiers of the\r\ntenth legion, by which he was then accompanied, halted. But the soldiers\r\nof the other legions, not hearing the sound of the trumpet, because\r\nthere was a very large valley between them, were however kept back by\r\nthe tribunes of the soldiers and the lieutenants, according to Caesar's\r\norders; but being animated by the prospect of speedy victory, and the\r\nflight of the enemy, and the favourable battles of former periods, they\r\nthought nothing so difficult that their bravery could not accomplish it;\r\nnor did they put an end to the pursuit, until they drew nigh to the wall\r\nof the town and the gates. But then, when a shout arose in every quarter\r\nof the city, those who were at a distance being alarmed by the sudden\r\ntumult, fled hastily from the town, since they thought that the enemy\r\nwere within the gates. The matrons begin to cast their clothes and\r\nsilver over the wall, and bending over as far as the lower part of the\r\nbosom, with outstretched hands beseech the Romans to spare them, and not\r\nto sacrifice to their resentment even women and children, as they had\r\ndone at Avaricum. Some of them let themselves down from the walls by\r\ntheir hands, and surrendered to our soldiers. Lucius Fabius, a centurion\r\nof the eighth legion, who, it was ascertained, had said that day among\r\nhis fellow soldiers that he was excited by the plunder of Avaricum, and\r\nwould not allow any one to mount the wall before him, finding three men\r\nof his own company, and being raised up by them, scaled the wall. He\r\nhimself, in turn, taking hold of them one by one, drew them up to the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nXLVIII.--In the meantime those who had gone to the other part of the\r\ntown to defend it, as we have mentioned above, at first, aroused by\r\nhearing the shouts, and, afterwards, by frequent accounts that the town\r\nwas in possession of the Romans, sent forward their cavalry, and\r\nhastened in larger numbers to that quarter. As each first came he stood\r\nbeneath the wall, and increased the number of his countrymen engaged in\r\naction. When a great multitude of them had assembled, the matrons, who a\r\nlittle before were stretching their hands from the walls to the Romans,\r\nbegan to beseech their countrymen, and after the Gallic fashion to show\r\ntheir dishevelled hair, and bring their children into public view.\r\nNeither in position nor in numbers was the contest an equal one to the\r\nRomans; at the same time, being exhausted by running and the long\r\ncontinuation of the fight, they could not easily withstand fresh and\r\nvigorous troops.\r\n\r\nXLIX.--Caesar, when he perceived that his soldiers were fighting on\r\nunfavourable ground, and that the enemy's forces were increasing, being\r\nalarmed for the safety of his troops, sent orders to Titus Sextius, one\r\nof his lieutenants, whom he had left to guard the smaller camp, to lead\r\nout his cohorts quickly from the camp, and post them at the foot of the\r\nhill, on the right wing of the enemy; that if he should see our men\r\ndriven from the ground, he should deter the enemy from following too\r\nclosely. He himself, advancing with the legion a little from that place\r\nwhere he had taken his post, awaited the issue of the battle.\r\n\r\nL.--While the fight was going on most vigorously, hand to hand, and the\r\nenemy depended on their position and numbers, our men on their bravery,\r\nthe Aedui suddenly appeared on our exposed flank, as Caesar had sent\r\nthem by another ascent on the right, for the sake of creating a\r\ndiversion. These, from the similarity of their arms, greatly terrified\r\nour men; and although they were discovered to have their right shoulders\r\nbare, which was usually the sign of those reduced to peace, yet the\r\nsoldiers suspected that this very thing was done by the enemy to deceive\r\nthem. At the same time Lucius Fabius the centurion, and those who had\r\nscaled the wall with him, being surrounded and slain, were cast from the\r\nwall. Marcus Petreius, a centurion of the same legion, after attempting\r\nto hew down the gates, was overpowered by numbers, and, despairing of\r\nhis safety, having already received many wounds, said to the soldiers of\r\nhis own company who followed him: \"Since I cannot save you as well as\r\nmyself, I shall at least provide for your safety, since I allured by the\r\nlove of glory, led you into this danger, do you save yourselves when an\r\nopportunity is given.\" At the same time he rushed into the midst of the\r\nenemy, and slaying two of them, drove back the rest a little from the\r\ngate. When his men attempted to aid him, \"In vain,\" he says, \"you\r\nendeavour to procure my safety since blood and strength are now failing\r\nme, therefore leave this, while you have the opportunity, and retreat to\r\nthe legion.\" Thus he fell fighting a few moments after, and saved his\r\nmen by his own death.\r\n\r\nLI.--Our soldiers, being hard pressed on every side, were dislodged from\r\ntheir position, with the loss of forty-six centurions; but the tenth\r\nlegion, which had been posted in reserve on ground a little more level,\r\nchecked the Gauls in their eager pursuit. It was supported by the\r\ncohorts of the thirteenth legion, which, being led from the smaller\r\ncamp, had, under the command of Titus Sextius, occupied the higher\r\nground. The legions, as soon as they reached the plain, halted and faced\r\nthe enemy. Vercingetorix led back his men from the part of the hill\r\nwithin the fortifications. On that day little less than seven hundred of\r\nthe soldiers were missing.\r\n\r\nLII.--On the next day, Caesar, having called a meeting, censured the\r\nrashness and avarice of his soldiers, \"In that they had judged for\r\nthemselves how far they ought to proceed, or what they ought to do, and\r\ncould not be kept back by the tribunes of the soldiers and the\r\nlieutenants;\" and stated, \"what the disadvantage of the ground could\r\neffect, what opinion he himself had entertained at Avaricum, when having\r\nsurprised the enemy without either general or cavalry, he had given up a\r\ncertain victory, lest even a trifling loss should occur in the contest\r\nowing to the disadvantage of position. That as much as he admired the\r\ngreatness of their courage, since neither the fortifications of the\r\ncamp, nor the height of the mountain, nor the wall of the town could\r\nretard them; in the same degree he censured their licentiousness and\r\narrogance, because they thought that they knew more than their general\r\nconcerning victory, and the issue of actions: and that he required in\r\nhis soldiers forbearance and self-command, not less than valour and\r\nmagnanimity.\"\r\n\r\nLIII.--Having held this assembly, and having encouraged the soldiers at\r\nthe conclusion of his speech, \"That they should not be dispirited on\r\nthis account, nor attribute to the valour of the enemy what the\r\ndisadvantage of position had caused;\" entertaining the same views of his\r\ndeparture that he had previously had, he led forth the legions from the\r\ncamp, and drew up his army in order of battle in a suitable place. When\r\nVercingetorix, nevertheless, would not descend to the level ground, a\r\nslight cavalry action, and that a successful one, having taken place, he\r\nled back his army into the camp. When he had done this, the next day,\r\nthinking that he had done enough to lower the pride of the Gauls, and to\r\nencourage the minds of his soldiers, he moved his camp in the direction\r\nof the Aedui. The enemy not even then pursuing us, on the third day he\r\nrepaired the bridge over the river Allier, and led over his whole army.\r\n\r\nLIV.--Having then held an interview with Viridomarus and Eporedorix the\r\nAeduans, he learns that Litavicus had set out with all the cavalry to\r\nraise the Aedui; that it was necessary that they too should go before\r\nhim to confirm the state in their allegiance. Although he now saw\r\ndistinctly the treachery of the Aedui in many things, and was of opinion\r\nthat the revolt of the entire state would be hastened by their\r\ndeparture; yet he thought that they should not be detained, lest he\r\nshould appear either to offer an insult, or betray some suspicion of\r\nfear. He briefly states to them when departing his services towards the\r\nAedui: in what a state and how humbled he had found them, driven into\r\ntheir towns, deprived of their lands, stripped of all their forces, a\r\ntribute imposed on them, and hostages wrested from them with the utmost\r\ninsult; and to what condition and to what greatness he had raised them,\r\n[so much so] that they had not only recovered their former position, but\r\nseemed to surpass the dignity and influence of all the previous eras of\r\ntheir history. After giving these admonitions he dismissed them.\r\n\r\nLV.--Noviodunum was a town of the Aedui, advantageously situated on the\r\nbanks of the Loire. Caesar had conveyed hither all the hostages of Gaul,\r\nthe corn, public money, a great part of his own baggage and that of his\r\narmy; he had sent hither a great number of horses, which he had\r\npurchased in Italy and Spain on account of this war. When Eporedorix and\r\nViridomarus came to this place, and received information of the\r\ndisposition of the state, that Litavicus had been admitted by the Aedui\r\ninto Bibracte, which is a town of the greatest importance among them,\r\nthat Convictolitanis the chief magistrate and a great part of the senate\r\nhad gone to meet him, that ambassadors had been publicly sent to\r\nVercingetorix to negotiate a peace and alliance; they thought that so\r\ngreat an opportunity ought not to be neglected. Therefore, having put to\r\nthe sword the garrison of Noviodunum and those who had assembled there\r\nfor the purpose of trading or were on their march, they divided the\r\nmoney and horses among themselves; they took care that the hostages of\r\nthe [different] states should be brought to Bibracte, to the chief\r\nmagistrate; they burnt the town to prevent its being of any service to\r\nthe Romans, as they were of opinion that they could not hold it; they\r\ncarried away in their vessels whatever corn they could in the hurry;\r\nthey destroyed the remainder, by [throwing it] into the river or setting\r\nit on fire; they themselves began to collect forces from the\r\nneighbouring country, to place guards and garrisons in different\r\npositions along the banks of the Loire, and to display the cavalry on\r\nall sides to strike terror into the Romans, [to try] if they could cut\r\nthem off from a supply of provisions. In which expectation they were\r\nmuch aided, from the circumstance that the Loire had swollen to such a\r\ndegree from the melting of the snows, that it did not seem capable of\r\nbeing forded at all.\r\n\r\nLVI.--Caesar on being informed of these movements was of opinion that he\r\nought to make haste, even if he should run some risk in completing the\r\nbridges, in order that he might engage before greater forces of the\r\nenemy should be collected in that place. For no one even then considered\r\nit an absolutely necessary act, that changing his design he should\r\ndirect his march into the Province, both because the infamy and disgrace\r\nof the thing, and the intervening mount Cevennes, and the difficulty of\r\nthe roads prevented him; and especially because he had serious\r\napprehensions for the safety of Labienus whom he had detached, and those\r\nlegions whom he had sent with him. Therefore, having made very long\r\nmarches by day and night, he came to the river Loire, contrary to the\r\nexpectation of all; and having by means of the cavalry found out a ford,\r\nsuitable enough considering the emergency, of such depth that their arms\r\nand shoulders could be above water for supporting their accoutrements,\r\nhe dispersed his cavalry in such a manner as to break the force of the\r\ncurrent, and having confounded the enemy at the first sight, led his\r\narmy across the river in safety; and finding corn and cattle in the\r\nfields, after refreshing his army with them, he determined to march into\r\nthe country of the Senones.\r\n\r\nLVII.--Whilst these things are being done by Caesar, Labienus, leaving\r\nat Agendicum the recruits who had lately arrived from Italy, to guard\r\nthe baggage, marches with four legions to Lutetia (which is a town of\r\nthe Parisii, situated on an island of the river Seine), whose arrival\r\nbeing discovered by the enemy, numerous forces arrived from the\r\nneighbouring states. The supreme command is entrusted to Camulogenus,\r\none of the Aulerci, who, although almost worn out with age, was called\r\nto that honour on account of his extraordinary knowledge of military\r\ntactics. He, when he observed that there was a large marsh which\r\ncommunicated with the Seine, and rendered all that country impassable,\r\nencamped there, and determined to prevent our troops from passing it.\r\n\r\nLVIII.--Labienus at first attempted to raise vineae, fill up the marsh\r\nwith hurdles and clay, and secure a road. After he perceived that this\r\nwas too difficult to accomplish, he issued in silence from his camp at\r\nthe third watch, and reached Melodunum by the same route by which he\r\ncame. This is a town of the Senones, situated on an island in the Seine,\r\nas we have just before observed of Lutetia. Having seized upon about\r\nfifty ships and quickly joined them together, and having placed soldiers\r\nin them, he intimidated by his unexpected arrival the inhabitants, of\r\nwhom a great number had been called out to the war, and obtains\r\npossession of the town without a contest. Having repaired the bridge,\r\nwhich the enemy had broken down during the preceding days, he led over\r\nhis army, and began to march along the banks of the river to Lutetia.\r\nThe enemy, on learning the circumstance from those who had escaped from\r\nMelodunum, set fire to Lutetia, and order the bridges of that town to be\r\nbroken down: they themselves set out from the marsh, and take their\r\nposition on the banks of the Seine, over against Lutetia and opposite\r\nthe camp of Labienus.\r\n\r\nLIX.--Caesar was now reported to have departed from Gergovia;\r\nintelligence was likewise brought to them concerning the revolt of the\r\nAedui, and a successful rising in Gaul; and that Caesar, having been\r\nprevented from prosecuting his journey and crossing the Loire, and\r\nhaving been compelled by the want of corn, had marched hastily to the\r\nprovince. But the Bellovaci, who had been previously disaffected of\r\nthemselves, on learning the revolt of the Aedui, began to assemble\r\nforces and openly to prepare for war; Then Labienus, as the change in\r\naffairs was so great, thought that he must adopt a very different system\r\nfrom what he had previously intended, and he did not now think of making\r\nany new acquisitions, or of provoking the enemy to an action; but that\r\nhe might bring back his army safe to Agendicum. For, on one side, the\r\nBellovaci, a state which held the highest reputation for prowess in\r\nGaul, were pressing on him; and Camulogenus, with a disciplined and\r\nwell-equipped army, held the other side; moreover, a very great river\r\nseparated and cut off the legions from the garrison and baggage. He saw\r\nthat, in consequence of such great difficulties being thrown in his way,\r\nhe must seek aid from his own energy of disposition.\r\n\r\nLX.--Having, therefore, called a council of war a little before evening,\r\nhe exhorted his soldiers to execute with diligence and energy such\r\ncommands as he should give; he assigns the ships which he had brought\r\nfrom Melodunum to Roman knights, one to each, and orders them to fall\r\ndown the river silently for four miles, at the end of the fourth watch,\r\nand there wait for him. He leaves the five cohorts, which he considered\r\nto be the most steady in action, to guard the camp; he orders the five\r\nremaining cohorts of the same legion to proceed a little after midnight\r\nup the river with all their baggage, in a great tumult. He collects also\r\nsome small boats; and sends them in the same direction, with orders to\r\nmake a loud noise in rowing. He himself, a little after, marched out in\r\nsilence, and, at the head of three legions, seeks that place to which he\r\nhad ordered the ships to be brought.\r\n\r\nLXI.--When he had arrived there, the enemy's scouts, as they were\r\nstationed along every part of the river, not expecting an attack,\r\nbecause a great storm had suddenly arisen, were surprised by our\r\nsoldiers: the infantry and cavalry are quickly transported, under the\r\nsuperintendence of the Roman knights, whom he had appointed to that\r\noffice. Almost at the same time, a little before daylight, intelligence\r\nwas given to the enemy that there was an unusual tumult in the camp of\r\nthe Romans, and that a strong force was marching up the river, and that\r\nthe sound of oars was distinctly heard in the same quarter, and that\r\nsoldiers were being conveyed across in ships a little below. On hearing\r\nthese things, because they were of opinion that the legions were passing\r\nin three different places, and that the entire army, being terrified by\r\nthe revolt of the Aedui, were preparing for flight, they divided their\r\nforces also into three divisions. For leaving a guard opposite to the\r\ncamp and sending a small body in the direction of Metiosedum, with\r\norders to advance as far as the ships would proceed, they led the rest\r\nof their troops against Labienus.\r\n\r\nLXII.--By day-break all our soldiers were brought across and the army of\r\nthe enemy was in sight. Labienus, having encouraged his soldiers \"to\r\nretain the memory of their ancient valour, and so many most successful\r\nactions, and imagine Caesar himself, under whose command they had so\r\noften routed the enemy, to be present,\" gives the signal for action. At\r\nthe first onset the enemy are beaten and put to flight in the right\r\nwing, where the seventh legion stood: on the left wing, which position\r\nthe twelfth legion held, although the first ranks fell transfixed by the\r\njavelins of the Romans, yet the rest resisted most bravely; nor did any\r\none of them show the slightest intention of flying. Camulogenus, the\r\ngeneral of the enemy, was present and encouraged his troops. But when\r\nthe issue of the victory was still uncertain, and the circumstances\r\nwhich were taking place on the left wing were announced to the tribunes\r\nof the seventh legion, they faced about their legion to the enemy's rear\r\nand attacked it: not even then did any one retreat, but all were\r\nsurrounded and slain. Camulogenus met the same fate. But those who were\r\nleft as a guard opposite the camp of Labienus, when they heard that the\r\nbattle was commenced, marched to aid their countrymen and take\r\npossession of a hill, but were unable to withstand the attack of the\r\nvictorious soldiers. In this manner, mixed with their own fugitives,\r\nsuch as the woods and mountains did not shelter were cut to pieces by\r\nour cavalry. When this battle was finished, Labienus returns to\r\nAgendicum, where the baggage of the whole army had been left: from it he\r\nmarched with all his forces to Caesar.\r\n\r\nLXIII.--The revolt of the Aedui being known, the war grows more\r\ndangerous. Embassies are sent by them in all directions: as far as they\r\ncan prevail by influence, authority, or money, they strive to excite the\r\nstate [to revolt]. Having got possession of the hostages whom Caesar had\r\ndeposited with them, they terrify the hesitating by putting them to\r\ndeath. The Aedui request Vercingetorix to come to them and communicate\r\nhis plans of conducting the war. On obtaining this request they insist\r\nthat the chief command should be assigned to them; and when the affair\r\nbecame a disputed question, a council of all Gaul is summoned to\r\nBibracte. They come together in great numbers and from every quarter to\r\nthe same place. The decision is left to the votes of the mass: all to a\r\nman approve of Vercingetorix as their general. The Remi, Lingones, and\r\nTreviri were absent from this meeting; the two former because they\r\nattached themselves to the alliance of Rome; the Treviri because they\r\nwere very remote and were hard pressed by the Germans; which was also\r\nthe reason of their being absent during the whole war, and their sending\r\nauxiliaries to neither party. The Aedui are highly indignant at being\r\ndeprived of the chief command; they lament the change of fortune, and\r\nmiss Caesar's indulgence towards them; however, after engaging in the\r\nwar, they do not dare to pursue their own measures apart from the rest.\r\nEporedorix and Viridomarus, youths of the greatest promise, submit\r\nreluctantly to Vercingetorix.\r\n\r\nLXIV.--The latter demands hostages from the remaining states: nay, more,\r\nappointed a day for this proceeding; he orders all the cavalry, fifteen\r\nthousand in number, to quickly assemble here; he says that he will be\r\ncontent with the infantry which he had before, and would not tempt\r\nfortune nor come to a regular engagement; but since he had abundance of\r\ncavalry, it would be very easy for him to prevent the Romans from\r\nobtaining forage or corn, provided that they themselves should\r\nresolutely destroy their corn and set fire to their houses, by which\r\nsacrifice of private property they would evidently obtain perpetual\r\ndominion and freedom. After arranging these matters he levies ten\r\nthousand infantry on the Aedui and Segusiani, who border on our\r\nprovince: to these he adds eight hundred horse. He sets over them the\r\nbrother of Eporedorix, and orders him to wage war against the\r\nAllobroges. On the other side he sends the Gabali and the nearest\r\ncantons of the Arverni against the Helvii; he likewise sends the Ruteni\r\nand Cadurci to lay waste the territories of the Volcae Arecomici.\r\nBesides, by secret messages and embassies, he tampers with the\r\nAllobroges, whose minds, he hopes, had not yet settled down after the\r\nexcitement of the late war. To their nobles he promises money, and to\r\ntheir state the dominion of the whole province.\r\n\r\nLXV.--The only guards provided against all these contingencies were\r\ntwenty-two cohorts, which were collected from the entire province by\r\nLucius Caesar, the lieutenant, and opposed to the enemy in every\r\nquarter. The Helvii, voluntarily engaging in battle with their\r\nneighbours, are defeated, and Caius Valerius Donotaurus, the son of\r\nCaburus, the principal man of the state, and several others, being\r\nslain, they are forced to retire within their towns and fortifications.\r\nThe Allobroges, placing guards along the course of the Rhine, defend\r\ntheir frontiers with great vigilance and energy. Caesar, as he perceived\r\nthat the enemy were superior in cavalry, and he himself could receive no\r\naid from the province or Italy, while all communication was cut off,\r\nsends across the Rhine into Germany to those states which he had subdued\r\nin the preceding campaigns, and summons from them cavalry and the\r\nlight-armed infantry, who were accustomed to engage among them. On their\r\narrival, as they were mounted on unserviceable horses, he takes horses\r\nfrom the military tribunes and the rest, nay, even from the Roman\r\nknights and veterans, and distributes them among the Germans.\r\n\r\nLXVI.--In the meantime, whilst these things are going on, the forces of\r\nthe enemy from the Arverni, and the cavalry which had been demanded from\r\nall Gaul, meet together. A great number of these having been collected,\r\nwhen Caesar was marching into the country of the Sequani, through the\r\nconfines of the Lingones, in order that he might the more easily render\r\naid to the province, Vercingetorix encamped in three camps, about ten\r\nmiles from the Romans: and having summoned the commanders of the cavalry\r\nto a council, he shows that the time of victory was come; that the\r\nRomans were fleeing into the province and leaving Gaul; that this was\r\nsufficient for obtaining immediate freedom; but was of little moment in\r\nacquiring peace and tranquillity for the future; for the Romans would\r\nreturn after assembling greater forces, and would not put an end to the\r\nwar; Therefore they should attack them on their march, when encumbered.\r\nIf the infantry should [be obliged to] relieve their cavalry, and be\r\nretarded by doing so, the march could not be accomplished: if,\r\nabandoning their baggage, they should provide for their safety (a result\r\nwhich, he trusted, was more likely to ensue), they would lose both\r\nproperty and character. For as to the enemy's horse, they ought not to\r\nentertain a doubt that none of them would dare to advance beyond the\r\nmain body. In order that they [the Gauls] may do so with greater spirit,\r\nhe would marshal all their forces before the camp, and intimidate the\r\nenemy. The cavalry unanimously shout out, \"That they ought to bind\r\nthemselves by a most sacred oath, that he should not be received under a\r\nroof, nor have access to his children, parents, or wife, who shall not\r\ntwice have ridden through the enemy's army.\"\r\n\r\nLXVII.--This proposal receiving general approbation, and all being\r\nforced to take the oath, on the next day the cavalry were divided into\r\nthree parts, and two of these divisions made a demonstration on our two\r\nflanks; while one in front began to obstruct our march. On this\r\ncircumstance being announced, Caesar orders his cavalry also to form\r\nthree divisions and charge the enemy. Then the action commences\r\nsimultaneously in every part: the main body halts; the baggage is\r\nreceived within the ranks of the legions. If our men seemed to be\r\ndistressed, or hard pressed in any quarter, Caesar usually ordered the\r\ntroops to advance, and the army to wheel round in that quarter; which\r\nconduct retarded the enemy in the pursuit, and encouraged our men by the\r\nhope of support. At length the Germans, on the right wing, having gained\r\nthe top of the hill, dislodge the enemy from their position and pursue\r\nthem even as far as the river at which Vercingetorix with the infantry\r\nwas stationed, and slay several of them. The rest, on observing this\r\naction, fearing lest they should be surrounded, betake themselves to\r\nflight. A slaughter ensues in every direction, and three of the noblest\r\nof the Audi are taken and brought to Caesar: Cotus, the commander of the\r\ncavalry, who had been engaged in the contest with Convictolitanis the\r\nlast election, Cavarillus, who had held the command of the infantry\r\nafter the revolt of Litavicus, and Eporedorix, under whose command the\r\nAedui had engaged in war against the Sequani, before the arrival of\r\nCaesar.\r\n\r\nLXVIII.--All his cavalry being routed, Vercingetorix led back his troops\r\nin the same order as he had arranged them before the camp, and\r\nimmediately began to march to Alesia, which is a town of the Mandubii;\r\nand ordered the baggage to be speedily brought forth from the camp, and\r\nfollow him closely. Caesar, having conveyed his baggage to the nearest\r\nhill, and having left two legions to guard it, pursued as far as the\r\ntime of day would permit, and after slaying about three thousand of the\r\nrear of the enemy, encamped at Alesia on the next day. On reconnoitring\r\nthe situation of the city, finding that the enemy were panic-stricken,\r\nbecause the cavalry in which they placed their chief reliance were\r\nbeaten, he encouraged his men to endure the toil, and began to draw a\r\nline of circumvallation round Alesia.\r\n\r\nLXIX.--The town itself was situated on the top of a hill, in a very\r\nlofty position, so that it did not appear likely to be taken, except by\r\na regular siege. Two rivers, on two different sides, washed the foot of\r\nthe hill. Before the town lay a plain of about three miles in length; on\r\nevery other side hills at a moderate distance, and of an equal degree of\r\nheight, surrounded the town. The army of the Gauls had filled all the\r\nspace under the wall, comprising the part of the hill which looked to\r\nthe rising sun, and had drawn in front a trench and a stone wall six\r\nfeet high. The circuit of that fortification, which was commenced by the\r\nRomans, comprised eleven miles. The camp was pitched in a strong\r\nposition, and twenty-three redoubts were raised in it, in which\r\nsentinels were placed by day, lest any sally should be made suddenly;\r\nand by night the same were occupied by watches and strong guards.\r\n\r\nLXX.-The work having been begun, a cavalry action ensues in that plain,\r\nwhich we have already described as broken by hills, and extending three\r\nmiles in length. The contest is maintained on both sides with the utmost\r\nvigour; Caesar sends the Germans to aid our troops when distressed, and\r\ndraws up the legions in front of the camp, lest any sally should be\r\nsuddenly made by the enemy's infantry. The courage of our men is\r\nincreased by the additional support of the legions; the enemy being put\r\nto flight, hinder one another by their numbers, and as only the narrower\r\ngates were left open, are crowded together in them; then the Germans\r\npursue them with vigour even to the fortifications. A great slaughter\r\nensues; some leave their horses, and endeavour to cross the ditch and\r\nclimb the wall. Caesar orders the legions which he had drawn up in front\r\nof the rampart to advance a little. The Gauls, who were within the\r\nfortifications, were no less panic-stricken, thinking that the enemy\r\nwere coming that moment against them, and unanimously shout \"to arms;\"\r\nsome in their alarm rush into the town; Vercingetorix orders the gates\r\nto be shut, lest the camp should be left undefended. The Germans\r\nretreat, after slaying many and taking several horses.\r\n\r\nLXXI.--Vercingetorix adopts the design of sending away all his cavalry\r\nby night, before the fortifications should be completed by the Romans.\r\nHe charges them when departing \"that each of them should go to his\r\nrespective state, and press for the war all who were old enough to bear\r\narms; he states his own Merits, and conjures them to consider his\r\nsafety, and not surrender him, who had deserved so well of the general\r\nfreedom, to the enemy for torture; he points out to them that, if they\r\nshould be remiss, eighty thousand chosen men would perish with him;\r\nthat, upon making a calculation, he had barely corn for thirty days, but\r\ncould hold out a little longer by economy.\" After giving these\r\ninstructions he silently dismisses the cavalry in the second watch, [on\r\nthat side] where our works were not completed; he orders all the corn to\r\nbe brought to himself; he ordains capital punishment to such as should\r\nnot obey; he distributes among them, man by man, the cattle, great\r\nquantities of which had been driven there by the Mandubii; he began to\r\nmeasure out the corn sparingly, and by little and little; he receives\r\ninto the town all the forces which he had posted in front of it. In this\r\nmanner he prepares to await the succours from Gaul, and carry on the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nLXXII.--Caesar, on learning these proceedings from the deserters and\r\ncaptives, adopted the following system of fortification; he dug a trench\r\ntwenty feet deep, with perpendicular sides, in such a manner that the\r\nbase of this trench should extend so far as the edges were apart at the\r\ntop. He raised all his other works at a distance of four hundred feet\r\nfrom that ditch; [he did] that with this intention, lest (since he\r\nnecessarily embraced so extensive an area, and the whole works could not\r\nbe easily surrounded by a line of soldiers) a large number of the enemy\r\nshould suddenly, or by night, sally against the fortifications; or lest\r\nthey should by day cast weapons against our men while occupied with the\r\nworks. Having left this interval, he drew two trenches fifteen feet\r\nbroad, and of the same depth; the innermost of them, being in low and\r\nlevel ground, he filled with water conveyed from the river. Behind these\r\nhe raised a rampart and wall twelve feet high: to this he added a\r\nparapet and battlements, with large stakes cut like stags' horns,\r\nprojecting from the junction of the parapet and battlements, to prevent\r\nthe enemy from scaling it, and surrounded the entire work with turrets,\r\nwhich were eighty feet distant from one another.\r\n\r\nLXXIII.--It was necessary, at one and the same time, to procure timber\r\n[for the rampart], lay in supplies of corn, and raise also extensive\r\nfortifications, and the available troops were in consequence of this\r\nreduced in number, since they used to advance to some distance from the\r\ncamp, and sometimes the Gauls endeavoured to attack our works, and to\r\nmake a sally from the town by several gates and in great force. On which\r\nCaesar thought that further additions should be made to these works, in\r\norder that the fortifications might be defensible by a small number of\r\nsoldiers. Having, therefore, cut down the trunks of trees or very thick\r\nbranches, and having stripped their tops of the bark, and sharpened them\r\ninto a point, he drew a continued trench everywhere five feet deep.\r\nThese stakes being sunk into this trench, and fastened firmly at the\r\nbottom, to prevent the possibility of their being torn up, had their\r\nbranches only projecting from the ground. There were five rows in\r\nconnection with, and intersecting each other; and whoever entered within\r\nthem were likely to impale themselves on very sharp stakes. The soldiers\r\ncalled these \"cippi.\" Before these, which were arranged in oblique rows\r\nin the form of a quincunx, pits three feet deep were dug, which\r\ngradually diminished in depth to the bottom. In these pits tapering\r\nstakes, of the thickness of a man's thigh, sharpened at the top and\r\nhardened in the fire, were sunk in such a manner as to project from the\r\nground not more than four inches; at the same time for the purpose of\r\ngiving them strength and stability, they were each filled with trampled\r\nclay to the height of one foot from the bottom: the rest of the pit was\r\ncovered over with osiers and twigs, to conceal the deceit. Eight rows of\r\nthis kind were dug, and were three feet distant from each other. They\r\ncalled this a lily from its resemblance to that flower. Stakes a foot\r\nlong, with iron hooks attached to them, were entirely sunk in the ground\r\nbefore these, and were planted in every place at small intervals; these\r\nthey called spurs.\r\n\r\nLXXIV.--After completing these works, having selected as level ground as\r\nhe could, considering the nature of the country, and having enclosed an\r\narea of fourteen miles, he constructed, against an external enemy,\r\nfortifications of the same kind in every respect, and separate from\r\nthese, so that the guards of the fortifications could not be surrounded\r\neven by immense numbers, if such a circumstance should take place owing\r\nto the departure of the enemy's cavalry; and in order that the Roman\r\nsoldiers might not be compelled to go out of the camp with great risk,\r\nhe orders all to provide forage and corn for thirty days.\r\n\r\nLXXV.--Whilst those things are carried on at Alesia, the Gauls, having\r\nconvened a council of their chief nobility, determine that all who could\r\nbear arms should not be called out, which was the opinion of\r\nVercingetorix, but that a fixed number should be levied from each state;\r\nlest, when so great a multitude assembled together, they could neither\r\ngovern nor distinguish their men, nor have the means of supplying them\r\nwith corn. They demand thirty-five thousand men from the Aedui and their\r\ndependents, the Segusiani, Ambivareti, and Aulerci Brannovices; an equal\r\nnumber from the Arverni in conjunction with the Eleuteti Cadurci,\r\nGabali, and Velauni, who were accustomed to be under the command of the\r\nArverni; twelve thousand each from the Senones, Sequani, Bituriges,\r\nSantones, Ruteni, and Carnutes; ten thousand from the Bellovaci; the\r\nsame number from the Lemovici; eight thousand each from the Pictones,\r\nand Turoni, and Parisii, and Helvii; five thousand each from the\r\nSuessiones, Ambiani, Mediomatrici, Petrocorii, Nervii, Morini, and\r\nNitiobriges; the same number from the Aulerci Cenomani; four thousand\r\nfrom the Atrebates; three thousand each from the Bellocassi, Lexovii,\r\nand Aulerci Eburovices; thirty thousand from the Rauraci, and Boii; six\r\nthousand, from all the states together which border on the Atlantic, and\r\nwhich in their dialect are called Armoricae (in which number are\r\ncomprehended the Curisolites, Rhedones, Ambibari, Caltes, Osismii,\r\nLemovices, Veneti, and Unelli). Of these the Bellovaci did not\r\ncontribute their number, as they said that they would wage war against\r\nthe Romans on their own account, and at their own discretion, and would\r\nnot obey the order of any one: however, at the request of Commius, they\r\nsent two thousand, in consideration of a tie of hospitality which\r\nsubsisted between him and them.\r\n\r\nLXXVI.--Caesar had, as we have previously narrated, availed himself of\r\nthe faithful and valuable services of this Commius, in Britain, in\r\nformer years: in consideration of which merits he had exempted from\r\ntaxes his [Commius's] state, and had conferred on Commius himself the\r\ncountry of the Morini. Yet such was the unanimity of the Gauls in\r\nasserting their freedom, and recovering their ancient renown in war,\r\nthat they were influenced neither by favours, nor by the recollection of\r\nprivate friendship; and all earnestly directed their energies and\r\nresources to that war, and collected eight thousand cavalry, and about\r\ntwo hundred and forty thousand infantry. These were reviewed in the\r\ncountry of the Aedui, and a calculation was made of their numbers:\r\ncommanders were appointed: the supreme command is entrusted to Commius\r\nthe Atrebatian, Viridomarus and Eporedorix the Aeduans, and\r\nVergasillaunus the Arvernian, the cousin-german of Vercingetorix. To\r\nthem are assigned men selected from each state, by whose advice the war\r\nshould be conducted. All march to Alesia, sanguine and full of\r\nconfidence: nor was there a single individual who imagined that the\r\nRomans could withstand the sight of such an immense host: especially in\r\nan action carried on both in front and rear, when [on the inside] the\r\nbesieged would sally from the town and attack the enemy, and on the\r\noutside so great forces of cavalry and infantry would be seen.\r\n\r\nLXXVII.--But those who were blockaded at Alesia, the day being past on\r\nwhich they had expected auxiliaries from their countrymen, and all their\r\ncorn being consumed, ignorant of what was going on among the Aedui,\r\nconvened an assembly and deliberated on the exigency of their situation.\r\nAfter various opinions had been expressed among them, some of which\r\nproposed a surrender, others a sally, whilst their strength would\r\nsupport it, the speech of Critognatus ought not to be omitted for its\r\nsingular and detestable cruelty. He sprung from the noblest family among\r\nthe Arverni, and possessing great influence, says, \"I shall pay no\r\nattention to the opinion of those who call a most disgraceful surrender\r\nby the name of a capitulation; nor do I think that they ought to be\r\nconsidered as citizens, or summoned to the council. My business is with\r\nthose who approve of a sally: in whose advice the memory of our ancient\r\nprowess seems to dwell in the opinion of you all. To be unable to bear\r\nprivation for a short time is disgraceful cowardice, not true valour.\r\nThose who voluntarily offer themselves to death are more easily found\r\nthan those who would calmly endure distress. And I would approve of this\r\nopinion (for honour is a powerful motive with me), could I foresee no\r\nother loss, save that of life: but let us, in adopting our design, look\r\nback on all Gaul, which we have stirred up to our aid. What courage do\r\nyou think would our relatives and friends have, if eighty thousand men\r\nwere butchered in one spot, supposing that they should be forced to come\r\nto an action almost over our corpses? Do not utterly deprive them of\r\nyour aid, for they have spurned all thoughts of personal danger on\r\naccount of your safety; nor by your folly, rashness, and cowardice,\r\ncrush all Gaul and doom it to an eternal slavery. Do you doubt their\r\nfidelity and firmness because they have not come at the appointed day?\r\nWhat then? Do you suppose that the Romans are employed every day in the\r\nouter fortifications for mere amusement? If you cannot be assured by\r\ntheir despatches, since every avenue is blocked up, take the Romans as\r\nevidence that their approach is drawing near; since they, intimidated by\r\nalarm at this, labour night and day at their works. What, therefore, is\r\nmy design? To do as our ancestors did in the war against the Cimbri and\r\nTeutones, which was by no means equally momentous; who, when driven into\r\ntheir towns, and oppressed by similar privations, supported life by the\r\ncorpses of those who appeared useless for war on account of their age,\r\nand did not surrender to the enemy: and even if we had not a precedent\r\nfor such cruel conduct, still I should consider it most glorious that\r\none should be established, and delivered to posterity. For in what was\r\nthat war like this? The Cimbri, after laying Gaul waste, and inflicting\r\ngreat calamities, at length departed from our country, and sought other\r\nlands; they left us our rights, laws, lands, and liberty. But what other\r\nmotive or wish have the Romans, than, induced by envy, to settle in the\r\nlands and states of those whom they have learned by fame to be noble and\r\npowerful in war, and impose on them perpetual slavery? For they never\r\nhave carried on wars on any other terms. But if you know not these\r\nthings which are going on in distant countries, look to the neighbouring\r\nGaul, which being reduced to the form of a province, stripped of its\r\nrights and laws, and subjected to Roman despotism, is oppressed by\r\nperpetual slavery.\"\r\n\r\nLXXVIII.--When different opinions were expressed, they determined that\r\nthose who, owing to age or ill health, were unserviceable for war,\r\nshould depart from the town, and that themselves should try every\r\nexpedient before they had recourse to the advice of Critognatus:\r\nhowever, that they would rather adopt that design, if circumstances\r\nshould compel them and their allies should delay, than accept any terms\r\nof a surrender or peace. The Mandubii, who had admitted them into the\r\ntown, are compelled to go forth with their wives and children. When\r\nthese came to the Roman fortifications, weeping, they begged of the\r\nsoldiers by every entreaty to receive them as slaves and relieve them\r\nwith food. But Caesar, placing guards on the rampart, forbade them to be\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\nLXXIX.--In the meantime, Commius and the rest of the leaders, to whom\r\nthe supreme command had been intrusted, came with all their forces to\r\nAlesia, and having occupied the entire hill, encamp not more than a mile\r\nfrom our fortifications. The following day, having led forth their\r\ncavalry from the camp, they fill all that plain, which, we have related,\r\nextended three miles in length, and draw out their infantry a little\r\nfrom that place, and post them on the higher ground. The town Alesia\r\ncommanded a view of the whole plain. The besieged run together when\r\nthese auxiliaries were seen; mutual congratulations ensue, and the minds\r\nof all are elated with joy. Accordingly, drawing out their troops, they\r\nencamp before the town, and cover the nearest trench with hurdles and\r\nfill it up with earth, and make ready for a sally and every casualty.\r\n\r\nLXXX.--Caesar, having stationed his army on both sides of the\r\nfortifications, in order that, if occasion should arise, each should\r\nhold and know his own post, orders the cavalry to issue forth from the\r\ncamp and commence action. There was a commanding view from the entire\r\ncamp, which occupied a ridge of hills; and the minds of all the soldiers\r\nanxiously awaited the issue of the battle. The Gauls had scattered\r\narchers and light-armed infantry here and there, among their cavalry, to\r\ngive relief to their retreating troops, and sustain the impetuosity of\r\nour cavalry. Several of our soldiers were unexpectedly wounded by these,\r\nand left the battle. When the Gauls were confident that their countrymen\r\nwere the conquerors in the action, and beheld our men hard pressed by\r\nnumbers, both those who were hemmed in by the line of circumvallation\r\nand those who had come to aid them, supported the spirits of their men\r\nby shouts and yells from every quarter. As the action was carried on in\r\nsight of all, neither a brave nor cowardly act could be concealed; both\r\nthe desire of praise and the fear of ignominy, urged on each party to\r\nvalour. After fighting from noon almost to sunset, without victory\r\ninclining in favour of either, the Germans, on one side, made a charge\r\nagainst the enemy in a compact body, and drove them back; and, when they\r\nwere put to flight, the archers were surrounded and cut to pieces. In\r\nother parts, likewise, our men pursued to the camp the retreating enemy,\r\nand did not give them an opportunity of rallying. But those who had come\r\nforth from Alesia returned into the town dejected and almost despairing\r\nof success.\r\n\r\nLXXXI.--The Gauls, after the interval of a day, and after making, during\r\nthat time, an immense number of hurdles, scaling ladders, and iron\r\nhooks, silently went forth from the camp at midnight and approached the\r\nfortifications in the plain. Raising a shout suddenly, that by this\r\nintimation those who were besieged in the town might learn their\r\narrival, they began to cast down hurdles and dislodge our men from the\r\nrampart by slings, arrows, and stones, and executed the other movements\r\nwhich are requisite in storming. At the same time, Vercingetorix having\r\nheard the shout, gives the signal to his troops by a trumpet, and leads\r\nthem forth from the town. Our troops, as each man's post had been\r\nassigned him some days before, man the fortifications; they intimidate\r\nthe Gauls by slings, large stones, stakes which they had placed along\r\nthe works, and bullets. All view being prevented by the darkness, many\r\nwounds are received on both sides; several missiles are thrown from the\r\nengines. But Marcus Antonius, and Caius Trebonius, the lieutenants, to\r\nwhom the defence of these parts had been allotted, draughted troops from\r\nthe redoubts which were more remote, and sent them to aid our troops, in\r\nwhatever direction they understood that they were hard pressed.\r\n\r\nLXXXII.--Whilst the Gauls were at a distance from the fortification,\r\nthey did more execution, owing to the immense number of their weapons:\r\nafter they came nearer, they either unawares empaled themselves on the\r\nspurs, or were pierced by the mural darts from the ramparts and towers,\r\nand thus perished. After receiving many wounds on all sides, and having\r\nforced no part of the works, when day drew nigh, fearing lest they\r\nshould be surrounded by a sally made from the higher camp on the exposed\r\nflank, they retreated to their countrymen. But those within, whilst they\r\nbring forward those things which had been prepared by Vercingetorix for\r\na sally, fill up the nearest trenches; having delayed a long time in\r\nexecuting these movements, they learned the retreat of their countrymen\r\nbefore they drew nigh to the fortifications. Thus they returned to the\r\ntown without accomplishing their object.\r\n\r\nLXXXIII.--The Gauls, having been twice repulsed with great loss, consult\r\nwhat they should do: they avail themselves of the information of those\r\nwho were well acquainted with the country; from them they ascertain the\r\nposition and fortification of the upper camp. There was, on the north\r\nside, a hill, which our men could not include in their works, on account\r\nof the extent of the circuit, and had necessarily made their camp in\r\nground almost disadvantageous, and pretty steep. Caius Antistius\r\nReginus, and Caius Caninius Rebilus, two of the lieutenants, with two\r\nlegions, were in possession of this camp. The leaders of the enemy,\r\nhaving reconnoitred the country by their scouts, select from the entire\r\narmy sixty thousand men; belonging to those states which bear the\r\nhighest character for courage: they privately arrange among themselves\r\nwhat they wished to be done, and in what manner; they decide that the\r\nattack should take place when it should seem to be noon. They appoint\r\nover their forces Vergasillaunus, the Arvernian, one of the four\r\ngenerals, and a near relative of Vercingetorix. He, having issued from\r\nthe camp at the first watch, and having almost completed his march a\r\nlittle before the dawn, hid himself behind the mountain, and ordered his\r\nsoldiers to refresh themselves after their labour during the night. When\r\nnoon now seemed to draw nigh, he marched hastily against that camp which\r\nwe have mentioned before; and, at the same time, the cavalry began to\r\napproach the fortifications in the plain, and the rest of the forces to\r\nmake a demonstration in front of the camp.\r\n\r\nLXXXIV.--Vercingetorix, having beheld his countrymen from the citadel of\r\nAlesia, issues forth from the town; he brings forth from the camp long\r\nhooks, movable pent-houses, mural hooks, and other things, which he had\r\nprepared for the purpose of making a sally. They engage on all sides at\r\nonce, and every expedient is adopted. They flocked to whatever part of\r\nthe works seemed weakest. The army of the Romans is distributed along\r\ntheir extensive lines, and with difficulty meets the enemy in every\r\nquarter. The shouts which were raised by the combatants in their rear,\r\nhad a great tendency to intimidate our men, because they perceived that\r\ntheir danger rested on the valour of others: for generally all evils\r\nwhich are distant most powerfully alarm men's minds.\r\n\r\nLXXXV.--Caesar, having selected a commanding situation, sees distinctly\r\nwhatever is going on in every quarter, and sends assistance to his\r\ntroops when hard pressed. The idea uppermost in the minds of both\r\nparties is, that the present is the time in which they would have the\r\nfairest opportunity of making a struggle; the Gauls despairing of all\r\nsafety, unless they should succeed in forcing the lines: the Romans\r\nexpecting an end to all their labours if they should gain the day. The\r\nprincipal struggle is at the upper lines, to which, we have said,\r\nVergasillaunus was sent. The least elevation of ground, added to a\r\ndeclivity, exercises a momentous influence. Some are casting missiles,\r\nothers, forming a testudo, advance to the attack; fresh men by turns\r\nrelieve the wearied. The earth, heaped up by all against the\r\nfortifications, gives the means of ascent to the Gauls, and covers those\r\nworks which the Romans had concealed in the ground. Our men have no\r\nlonger arms or strength.\r\n\r\nLXXXVI.--Caesar, on observing these movements, sends Labienus with six\r\ncohorts to relieve his distressed soldiers: he orders him, if he should\r\nbe unable to withstand them, to draw off the cohorts and make a sally;\r\nbut not to do this except through necessity. He himself goes to the\r\nrest, and exhorts them not to succumb to the toil; he shows them that\r\nthe fruits of all former engagements depend on that day and hour. The\r\nGauls within, despairing of forcing the fortifications in the plains on\r\naccount of the greatness of the works, attempt the places precipitous in\r\nascent: hither they bring the engines which they had prepared; by the\r\nimmense number of their missiles they dislodge the defenders from the\r\nturrets: they fill the ditches with clay and hurdles, then clear the\r\nway; they tear down the rampart and breast-work with hooks.\r\n\r\nLXXXVII.--Caesar sends at first young Brutus, with six cohorts, and\r\nafterwards Caius Fabius, his lieutenant, with seven others: finally, as\r\nthey fought more obstinately, he leads up fresh men to the assistance of\r\nhis soldiers. After renewing the action, and repulsing the enemy, he\r\nmarches in the direction in which he had sent Labienus, drafts four\r\ncohorts from the nearest redoubt, and orders part of the cavalry to\r\nfollow him, and part to make the circuit of the external fortifications\r\nand attack the enemy in the rear. Labienus, when neither the ramparts or\r\nditches could check the onset of the enemy, informs Caesar by messengers\r\nof what he intended to do. Caesar hastens to share in the action.\r\n\r\nLXXXVIII.--His arrival being known from the colour of his robe, and the\r\ntroops of cavalry, and the cohorts which he had ordered to follow him\r\nbeing seen, as these low and sloping grounds were plainly visible from\r\nthe eminences, the enemy join battle. A shout being raised by both\r\nsides, it was succeeded by a general shout along the ramparts and whole\r\nline of fortifications. Our troops, laying aside their javelins, carry\r\non the engagement with their swords. The cavalry is suddenly seen in the\r\nrear of the Gauls: the other cohorts advance rapidly; the enemy turn\r\ntheir backs; the cavalry intercept them in their flight, and a great\r\nslaughter ensues. Sedulius the general and chief of the Lemovices is\r\nslain; Vergasillaunus, the Arvernian, is taken alive in the flight,\r\nseventy-four military standards are brought to Caesar, and few out of so\r\ngreat a number return safe to their camp. The besieged, beholding from\r\nthe town the slaughter and flight of their countrymen, despairing of\r\nsafety, lead back their troops from the fortifications. A flight of the\r\nGauls from their camp immediately ensues on hearing of this disaster,\r\nand had not the soldiers been wearied by sending frequent\r\nreinforcements, and the labour of the entire day, all the enemy's forces\r\ncould have been destroyed. Immediately after midnight, the cavalry are\r\nsent out and overtake the rear, a great number are taken or cut to\r\npieces, the rest by flight escape in different directions to their\r\nrespective states. Vercingetorix, having convened a council the\r\nfollowing day, declares, \"That he had undertaken that war, not on\r\naccount of his own exigencies, but on account of the general freedom;\r\nand since he must yield to fortune, he offered himself to them for\r\neither purpose, whether they should wish to atone to the Romans by his\r\ndeath, or surrender him alive.\" Ambassadors are sent to Caesar on this\r\nsubject. He orders their arms to be surrendered, and their chieftains\r\ndelivered up. He seated himself at the head of the lines in front of the\r\ncamp, the Gallic chieftains are brought before him. They surrender\r\nVercingetorix, and lay down their arms. Reserving the Aedui and Arverni,\r\n[to try] if he could gain over, through their influence, their\r\nrespective states, he distributes one of the remaining captives to each\r\nsoldier, throughout the entire army, as plunder.\r\n\r\nXC.--After making these arrangements, he marches into the [country of\r\nthe] Aedui, and recovers that state. To this place ambassadors are sent\r\nby the Arverni, who promise that they will execute his commands. He\r\ndemands a great number of hostages. He sends the legions to winter\r\nquarters; he restores about twenty thousand captives to the Aedui and\r\nArverni; he orders Titus Labienus to march into the [country of the]\r\nSequani with two legions and the cavalry, and to him he attaches Marcus\r\nSempronius Rutilus; he places Caius Fabius, and Lucius Minucius Basilus,\r\nwith two legions in the country of the Remi, lest they should sustain\r\nany loss from the Bellovaci in their neighbourhood. He sends Caius\r\nAntistius Reginus into the [country of the] Ambivareti, Titus Sextius\r\ninto the territories of the Bituriges, and Caius Caninius Rebilus into\r\nthose of the Ruteni, with one legion each. He stations Quintus Tullius\r\nCicero, and Publius Sulpicius among the Aedui at Cabillo and Matisco on\r\nthe Saone, to procure supplies of corn. He himself determines to winter\r\nat Bibracte. A supplication of twenty days is decreed by the senate at\r\nRome, on learning these successes from Caesar's despatches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII\r\n\r\nCONTINUATION OF CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR ASCRIBED TO AULUS HIRTIUS\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nPrevailed on by your continued solicitations, Balbus, I have engaged in\r\na most difficult task, as my daily refusals appear to plead not my\r\ninability, but indolence, as an excuse. I have compiled a continuation\r\nof the Commentaries of our Caesar's Wars in Gaul, not indeed to be\r\ncompared to his writings, which either precede or follow them; and\r\nrecently, I have completed what he left imperfect after the transactions\r\nin Alexandria, to the end, not indeed of the civil broils, to which we\r\nsee no issue, but of Caesar's life. I wish that those who may read them\r\ncould know how unwillingly I undertook to write them, as then I might\r\nthe more readily escape the imputation of folly and arrogance, in\r\npresuming to intrude among Caesar's writings. For it is agreed on all\r\nhands, that no composition was ever executed with so great care, that it\r\nis not exceeded in elegance by these Commentaries, which were published\r\nfor the use of historians, that they might not want memoirs of such\r\nachievements; and they stand so high in the esteem of all men, that\r\nhistorians seem rather deprived of than furnished with materials. At\r\nwhich we have more reason to be surprised than other men; for they can\r\nonly appreciate the elegance and correctness with which he finished\r\nthem, while we know with what ease and expedition. Caesar possessed not\r\nonly an uncommon flow of language and elegance of style, but also a\r\nthorough knowledge of the method of conveying his ideas. But I had not\r\neven the good fortune to share in the Alexandrian or African war; and\r\nthough these were partly communicated to me by Caesar himself, in\r\nconversation, yet we listen with a different degree of attention to\r\nthose things which strike us with admiration by their novelty, and those\r\nwhich we design to attest to posterity. But, in truth, whilst I urge\r\nevery apology, that I may not be compared to Caesar, I incur the charge\r\nof vanity, by thinking it possible that I can in the judgment of any one\r\nbe put in competition with him. Farewell.\r\n\r\nI.--Gaul being entirely reduced, when Caesar having waged war\r\nincessantly during the former summer, wished to recruit his soldiers\r\nafter so much fatigue, by repose in winter quarters, news was brought\r\nhim that several states were simultaneously renewing their hostile\r\nintentions, and forming combinations. For which a probable reason was\r\nassigned: namely, that the Gauls were convinced that they were not able\r\nto resist the Romans with any force they could collect in one place; and\r\nhoped that if several states made war in different places at the same\r\ntime, the Roman army would neither have aid, nor time, nor forces, to\r\nprosecute them all: nor ought any single state to decline any\r\ninconveniences that might befall them, provided that by such delay the\r\nrest should be enabled to assert their liberty.\r\n\r\nII.--That this notion might not be confirmed among the Gauls, Caesar\r\nleft Marcus Antonius, his quaestor, in charge of his quarters, and set\r\nout himself with a guard of horse, the day before the kalends of\r\nJanuary, from the town Bibracte, to the thirteenth legion, which he had\r\nstationed in the country of the Bituriges, not far from the territories\r\nof the Aedui, and joined to it the eleventh legion which was next it.\r\nLeaving two cohorts to guard the baggage, he leads the rest of his army\r\ninto the most plentiful part of the country of the Bituriges; who,\r\npossessing an extensive territory and several towns, were not to be\r\ndeterred, by a single legion quartered among them, from making warlike\r\npreparation, and forming combinations.\r\n\r\nIII.-By Caesar's sudden arrival, it happened, as it necessarily must, to\r\nan unprovided and dispersed people, that they were surprised by our\r\nhorse, whilst cultivating the fields without any apprehensions, before\r\nthey had time to fly to their towns. For the usual sign of an enemy's\r\ninvasion, which is generally intimated by the burning of their towns,\r\nwas forbidden by Caesar's orders: lest if he advanced far, forage and\r\ncorn should become scarce, or the enemy be warned by the fires to make\r\ntheir escape. Many thousands being taken, as many of the Bituriges as\r\nwere able to escape the first coming of the Romans, fled to the\r\nneighbouring states, relying either on private friendship, or public\r\nalliance. In vain; for Caesar, by hasty marches, anticipated them in\r\nevery place, nor did he allow any state leisure to consider the safety\r\nof others, in preference to their own. By this activity, he both\r\nretained his friends in their loyalty, and by fear, obliged the wavering\r\nto accept offers of peace. Such offers being made to the Bituriges, when\r\nthey perceived that through Caesar's clemency, an avenue was open to his\r\nfriendship, and that the neighbouring states had given hostages, without\r\nincurring any punishment, and had been received under his protection,\r\nthey did the same.\r\n\r\nIV.-Caesar promises his soldiers, as a reward for their labour and\r\npatience, in cheerfully submitting to hardships from the severity of the\r\nwinter, the difficulty of the roads, and the intolerable cold, two\r\nhundred sestertii each, and to every centurian two thousand, to be given\r\ninstead of plunder; and sending his legions back to quarters, he himself\r\nreturned on the fortieth day to Bibracte. Whilst he was dispensing\r\njustice there, the Bituriges send ambassadors to him, to entreat his aid\r\nagainst the Carnutes, who they complained had made war against them.\r\nUpon this intelligence, though he had not remained more than eighteen\r\ndays in winter quarters, he draws the fourteenth and sixth legion out of\r\nquarters on the Saone, where he had posted them as mentioned in a former\r\nCommentary to procure supplies of corn. With these two legions he\r\nmarches in pursuit of the Carnutes.\r\n\r\nV.--When the news of the approach of our army reached the enemy, the\r\nCarnutes, terrified by the sufferings of other states, deserted their\r\nvillages and towns (which were small buildings, raised in a hurry, to\r\nmeet the immediate necessity, in which they lived to shelter themselves\r\nagainst the winter, for, being lately conquered, they had lost several\r\ntowns), and dispersed and fled. Caesar, unwilling to expose his soldiers\r\nto the violent storms that break out, especially at that season, took up\r\nhis quarters at Genabum, a town of the Carnutes; and lodged his men in\r\nhouses, partly belonging to the Gauls, and partly built to shelter the\r\ntents, and hastily covered with thatch. But the horse and auxiliaries he\r\nsends to all parts to which he was told the enemy had marched; and not\r\nwithout effect, as our men generally returned loaded with booty. The\r\nCarnutes, overpowered by the severity of the winter, and the fear of\r\ndanger, and not daring to continue long in any place, as they were\r\ndriven from their houses, and not finding sufficient protection in the\r\nwoods, from the violence of the storms, after losing a considerable\r\nnumber of their men, disperse, and take refuge among the neighbouring\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nVI.--Caesar, being contented, at so severe a season, to disperse the\r\ngathering foes, and prevent any new war from breaking out, and being\r\nconvinced, as far as reason could foresee, that no war of consequence\r\ncould be set on foot in the summer campaign, stationed Caius Trebonius,\r\nwith the two legions which he had with him, in quarters at Genabum: and\r\nbeing informed by frequent embassies from the Remi, that the Bellovaci\r\n(who exceed all the Gauls and Belgae in military prowess), and the\r\nneighbouring states, headed by Correus, one of the Bellovaci, and\r\nComius, the Atrebatian, were raising an army, and assembling at a\r\ngeneral rendezvous, designing with their united forces to invade the\r\nterritories of the Suessiones, who were put under the patronage of the\r\nRemi: and moreover, considering that not only his honour, but his\r\ninterest was concerned, that such of his allies, as deserved well of the\r\nrepublic, should suffer no calamity; he again draws the eleventh legion\r\nout of quarters and writes besides to Caius Fabius, to march with his\r\ntwo legions to the country of the Suessiones; and he sends to Trebonius\r\nfor one of his two legions. Thus, as far as the convenience of the\r\nquarters, and the management of the war admitted, he laid the burden of\r\nthe expedition on the legions by turns, without any intermission to his\r\nown toils.\r\n\r\nVII.--As soon as his troops were collected, he marched against the\r\nBellovaci: and pitching his camp in their territories, detached troops\r\nof horse all round the country, to take prisoners, from whom he might\r\nlearn the enemy's plan. The horse, having executed his orders, bring him\r\nback word that but few were found in the houses: and that even these had\r\nnot stayed at home to cultivate their lands (for the emigration was\r\ngeneral from all parts), but had been sent back to watch our motions.\r\nUpon Caesar's inquiring from them, where the main body of the Bellovaci\r\nwere posted, and what was their design: they made answer, \"that all the\r\nBellovaci, fit for carrying arms, had assembled in one place, and along\r\nwith them the Ambiani, Aulerci, Caletes, Velocasses, and Atrebates, and\r\nthat they had chosen for their camp an elevated position, surrounded by\r\na dangerous morass: that they had conveyed all their baggage into the\r\nmost remote woods: that several noblemen were united in the management\r\nof the war; but that the people were most inclined to be governed by\r\nCorreus, because they knew that he had the strongest aversion to the\r\nname of the Roman people: that a few days before Comius had left the\r\ncamp to engage the Germans to their aid whose nation bordered on theirs,\r\nand whose numbers were countless: that the Bellovaci had come to a\r\nresolution, with the consent of all the generals and the earnest desire\r\nof the people, if Caesar should come with only three legions, as was\r\nreported, to give him battle, that they might not be obliged to\r\nencounter his whole army on a future occasion, when they should be in a\r\nmore wretched and distressed condition; but if he brought a stronger\r\nforce, they intended to remain in the position they had chosen, and by\r\nambuscade to prevent the Romans from getting forage (which at that\r\nseason was both scarce and much scattered), corn, and other\r\nnecessaries.\"\r\n\r\nVIII.--When Caesar was convinced of the truth of this account from the\r\nconcurring testimony of several persons, and perceived that the plans\r\nwhich were proposed were full of prudence, and very unlike the rash\r\nresolves of a barbarous people, he considered it incumbent on him to use\r\nevery exertion, in order that the enemy might despise his small force\r\nand come to an action. For he had three veteran legions of distinguished\r\nvalour, the seventh, eighth, and ninth. The eleventh consisted of chosen\r\nyouth of great hopes, who had served eight campaigns, but who, compared\r\nwith the others, had not yet acquired any great reputation for\r\nexperience and valour. Calling therefore a council, and laying before it\r\nthe intelligence which he had received, he encouraged his soldiers. In\r\norder if possible to entice the enemy to an engagement by the appearance\r\nof only three legions, he ranged his army in the following manner: that\r\nthe seventh, eighth, and ninth legions should march before all the\r\nbaggage; that then the eleventh should bring up the rear of the whole\r\ntrain of baggage (which however was but small, as is usual on such\r\nexpeditions), so that the enemy could not get a sight of a greater\r\nnumber than they themselves were willing to encounter. By this\r\ndisposition he formed his army almost into a square, and brought them\r\nwithin sight of the enemy sooner than was anticipated.\r\n\r\nIX.--When the Gauls, whose bold resolutions had been reported to Caesar,\r\nsaw the legions advance with a regular motion, drawn up in battle array;\r\neither from the danger of an engagement, or our sudden approach, or with\r\nthe design of watching our movements, they drew up their forces before\r\nthe camp, and did not quit the rising ground. Though Caesar wished to\r\nbring them to battle, yet being surprised to see so vast a host of the\r\nenemy, he encamped opposite to them, with a valley between them, deep\r\nrather than extensive. He ordered his camp to be fortified with a\r\nrampart twelve feet high, with breast-works built on it proportioned to\r\nits height; and two trenches, each fifteen feet broad, with\r\nperpendicular sides to be sunk: likewise several turrets, three stories\r\nhigh, to be raised, with a communication to each other by galleries laid\r\nacross and covered over; which should be guarded in front by small\r\nparapets of osiers; that the enemy might be repulsed by two rows of\r\nsoldiers. The one of whom, being more secure from danger by their\r\nheight, might throw their darts with more daring and to a greater\r\ndistance; the other, which was nearer the enemy, being stationed on the\r\nrampart, would be protected by their galleries from darts falling on\r\ntheir heads. At the entrance he erected gates and turrets of a\r\nconsiderable height.\r\n\r\nX.-Caesar had a double design in this fortification; for he both hoped\r\nthat the strength of his works, and his [apparent] fears would raise\r\nconfidence in the barbarians; and when there should be occasion to make\r\na distant excursion to get forage or corn, he saw that his camp would be\r\nsecured by the works with a very small force. In the meantime there were\r\nfrequent skirmishes across the marsh, a few on both sides sallying out\r\nbetween the two camps. Sometimes, however, our Gallic or German\r\nauxiliaries crossed the marsh, and furiously pursued the enemy; or on\r\nthe other hand the enemy passed it and beat back our men. Moreover there\r\nhappened in the course of our daily foraging, what must of necessity\r\nhappen, when corn is to be collected by a few scattered men out of\r\nprivate houses, that our foragers dispersing in an intricate country\r\nwere surrounded by the enemy; by which, though we suffered but an\r\ninconsiderable loss of cattle and servants, yet it raised foolish hopes\r\nin the barbarians; but more especially, because Comius, who I said had\r\ngone to get aid from the Germans, returned with some cavalry, and though\r\nthe Germans were only 500, yet the barbarians were elated by their\r\narrival.\r\n\r\nXI.-Caesar, observing that the enemy kept for several days within their\r\ncamp, which was well secured by a morass and its natural situation, and\r\nthat it could not be assaulted without a dangerous engagement, nor the\r\nplace enclosed with lines without an addition to his army, wrote to\r\nTrebonius to send with all despatch for the thirteenth legion which was\r\nin winter-quarters among the Bituriges under Titus Sextius, one of his\r\nlieutenants; and then to come to him by forced marches with the three\r\nlegions. He himself sent the cavalry of the Remi, and Lingones, and\r\nother states, from whom he had required a vast number, to guard his\r\nforaging parties, and to support them in case of any sudden attack of\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nXII.--As this continued for several days, and their vigilance was\r\nrelaxed by custom (an effect which is generally produced by time), the\r\nBellovaci, having made themselves acquainted with the daily stations of\r\nour horse, lie in ambush with a select body of foot in a place covered\r\nwith woods; to it they sent their horse the next day, who were first to\r\ndecoy our men into the ambuscade, and then when they were surrounded, to\r\nattack them. It was the lot of the Remi to fall into this snare, to whom\r\nthat day had been allotted to perform this duty; for, having suddenly\r\ngot sight of the enemy's cavalry, and despising their weakness, in\r\nconsequence of their superior numbers, they pursued them too eagerly,\r\nand were surrounded on every side by the foot. Being by this means\r\nthrown into disorder they returned with more precipitation than is usual\r\nin cavalry actions, with the loss of Vertiscus, the governor of their\r\nstate, and the general of their horse, who, though scarcely able to sit\r\non horseback through years, neither, in accordance with the custom of\r\nthe Gauls, pleaded his age in excuse for not accepting the command, nor\r\nwould he suffer them to fight without him. The spirits of the barbarians\r\nwere puffed up and inflated at the success of this battle, in killing\r\nthe prince and general of the Remi; and our men were taught by this\r\nloss, to examine the country, and post their guards with more caution,\r\nand to be more moderate in pursuing a retreating enemy.\r\n\r\nXIII.--In the meantime daily skirmishes take place continually in view\r\nof both camps; these were fought at the ford and pass of the morass. In\r\none of these contests the Germans, whom Caesar had brought over the\r\nRhine, to fight intermixed with the horse, having resolutely crossed the\r\nmarsh, and slain the few who made resistance, and boldly pursued the\r\nrest, so terrified them, that not only those who were attacked hand to\r\nhand, or wounded at a distance, but even those who were stationed at a\r\ngreater distance to support them, fled disgracefully; and being often\r\nbeaten from the rising grounds, did not stop till they had retired into\r\ntheir camp, or some, impelled by fear, had fled farther. Their danger\r\ndrew their whole army into such confusion, that it was difficult to\r\njudge whether they were more insolent after a slight advantage, or more\r\ndejected by a trifling calamity.\r\n\r\nXIV.--After spending several days in the same camp, the guards of the\r\nBellovaci, learning that Caius Trebonius was advancing nearer with his\r\nlegions, and fearing a siege like that of Alesia, send off by night all\r\nwho were disabled by age or infirmity, or unarmed, and along with them\r\ntheir whole baggage. Whilst they are preparing their disorderly and\r\nconfused troop for march (for the Gauls are always attended by a vast\r\nmultitude of waggons, even when they have very light baggage), being\r\novertaken by daylight, they drew their forces out before their camp, to\r\nprevent the Romans attempting a pursuit before the line of their baggage\r\nhad advanced to a considerable distance. But Caesar did not think it\r\nprudent to attack them when standing on their defence, with such a steep\r\nhill in their favour, nor keep his legions at such a distance that they\r\ncould quit their post without danger: but, perceiving that his camp was\r\ndivided from the enemy's by a deep morass, so difficult to cross that he\r\ncould not pursue with expedition, and that the hill beyond the morass,\r\nwhich extended almost to the enemy's camp, was separated from it only by\r\na small valley, he laid a bridge over the morass and led his army\r\nacross, and soon reached the plain on the top of the hill, which was\r\nfortified on either side by a steep ascent. Having there drawn up his\r\narmy in order of battle, he marched to the furthest hill, from which he\r\ncould, with his engines, shower darts upon the thickest of the enemy.\r\n\r\nXV.--The Gauls, confiding in the natural strength of their position,\r\nthough they would not decline an engagement if the Romans attempted to\r\nascend the hill, yet dared not divide their forces into small parties,\r\nlest they should be thrown into disorder by being dispersed, and\r\ntherefore remained in order of battle. Caesar, perceiving that they\r\npersisted in their resolution, kept twenty cohorts in battle array, and,\r\nmeasuring out ground there for a camp, ordered it to be fortified.\r\nHaving completed his works, he drew up his legions before the rampart\r\nand stationed the cavalry in certain positions, with their horses\r\nbridled. When the Bellovaci saw the Romans prepared to pursue them, and\r\nthat they could not wait the whole night, or continue longer in the same\r\nplace without provisions, they formed the following plan to secure a\r\nretreat. They handed to one another the bundles of straw and sticks on\r\nwhich they sat (for it is the custom of the Gauls to sit when drawn up\r\nin order of battle, as has been asserted in former commentaries), of\r\nwhich they had great plenty in their camp, and piled them in the front\r\nof their line; and at the close of the day, on a certain signal, set\r\nthem all on fire at one and the same time. The continued blaze soon\r\nscreened all their forces from the sight of the Romans, which no sooner\r\nhappened than the barbarians fled with the greatest precipitation.\r\n\r\nXVI.--Though Caesar could not perceive the retreat of the enemy for the\r\nintervention of the fire, yet, suspecting that they had adopted that\r\nmethod to favour their escape, he made his legions advance, and sent a\r\nparty of horse to pursue them; but, apprehensive of an ambuscade, and\r\nthat the enemy might remain in the same place and endeavour to draw our\r\nmen into a disadvantageous situation, he advances himself but slowly.\r\nThe horse, being afraid to venture into the smoke and dense line of\r\nflame, and those who were bold enough to attempt it being scarcely able\r\nto see their horses' heads, gave the enemy free liberty to retreat,\r\nthrough fear of an ambuscade. Thus, by a flight, full at once of\r\ncowardice and address, they advanced without any loss about ten miles,\r\nand encamped in a very strong position. From which, laying numerous\r\nambuscades, both of horse and foot, they did considerable damage to the\r\nRoman foragers.\r\n\r\nXVII.--After this had happened several times, Caesar discovered, from a\r\ncertain prisoner, that Correus, the general of the Bellovaci, had\r\nselected six thousand of his bravest foot and a thousand horse, with\r\nwhich he designed to lie in ambush in a place to which he suspected the\r\nRomans would send to look for forage, on account of the abundance of\r\ncorn and grass. Upon receiving information of their design Caesar drew\r\nout more legions than he usually did, and sent forward his cavalry as\r\nusual, to protect the foragers. With these he intermixed a guard of\r\nlight infantry, and himself advanced with the legions as fast as he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nXVIII.--The Gauls, placed in ambush, had chosen for the seat of action a\r\nlevel piece of bound, not more than a mile in extent, enclosed on every\r\nside by a thick wood or a very deep river, as by a toil, and this they\r\nsurrounded. Our men, apprised of the enemy's design, marched in good\r\norder to the ground, ready both in heart and hand to give battle, and\r\nwilling to hazard any engagement when the legions were at their back. On\r\ntheir approach, as Correus supposed that he had got an opportunity of\r\neffecting his purpose, he at first shows himself with a small party and\r\nattacks the foremost troops. Our men resolutely stood the charge, and\r\ndid not crowd together in one place, as commonly happens from surprise\r\nin engagements between the horse, whose numbers prove injurious to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nXIX.--When by the judicious arrangement of our forces only a few of our\r\nmen fought by turns, and did not suffer themselves to be surrounded, the\r\nrest of the enemy broke out from the woods whilst Correus was engaged.\r\nThe battle was maintained in different parts with great vigour, and\r\ncontinued for a long time undecided, till at length a body of foot\r\ngradually advanced from the woods in order of battle and forced our\r\nhorse to give ground: the light infantry, which were sent before the\r\nlegions to the assistance of the cavalry, soon came up, and, mixing with\r\nthe horse, fought with great courage. The battle was for some time\r\ndoubtful, but, as usually happens, our men, who stood the enemy's first\r\ncharge, became superior from this very circumstance that, though\r\nsuddenly attacked from an ambuscade, they had sustained no loss. In the\r\nmeantime the legions were approaching, and several messengers arrived\r\nwith notice to our men and the enemy that the [Roman] general was near\r\nat hand, with his forces in battle array. Upon this intelligence, our\r\nmen, confiding in the support of the cohorts, fought most resolutely,\r\nfearing, lest if they should be slow in their operations they should let\r\nthe legions participate in the glory of the conquest. The enemy lose\r\ncourage and attempt to escape by different ways. In vain; for they were\r\nthemselves entangled in that labyrinth in which they thought to entrap\r\nthe Romans. Being defeated and put to the rout, and having lost the\r\ngreater part of their men, they fled in consternation whither-soever\r\nchance carried them; some sought the woods, others the river, but were\r\nvigorously pursued by our men and put to the sword. Yet, in the\r\nmeantime, Correus, unconquered by calamity, could not be prevailed on to\r\nquit the field and take refuge in the woods, or accept our offers of\r\nquarter, but, fighting courageously and wounding several, provoked our\r\nmen, elated with victory, to discharge their weapons against him.\r\n\r\nXX.--After this transaction, Caesar, having come up immediately after\r\nthe battle, and imagining that the enemy, upon receiving the news of so\r\ngreat a defeat, would be so depressed that they would abandon their\r\ncamp, which was not above eight miles distant from the scene of action,\r\nthough he saw his passage obstructed by the river, yet he marched his\r\narmy over and advanced. But the Bellovaci and the other states, being\r\ninformed of the loss they had sustained by a few wounded men who having\r\nescaped by the shelter of the woods, had returned to them after the\r\ndefeat, and learning that everything had turned out unfavourable, that\r\nCorreus was slain, and the horse and most valiant of their foot cut off,\r\nimagined that the Romans were marching against them, and calling a\r\ncouncil in haste by sound of trumpet, unanimously cry out to send\r\nambassadors and hostages to Caesar.\r\n\r\nXXI.--This proposal having met with general approbation, Comius the\r\nAtrebatian fled to those Germans from whom he had borrowed auxiliaries\r\nfor that war. The rest instantly send ambassadors to Caesar; and\r\nrequested that he would be contented with that punishment of his enemy,\r\nwhich if he had possessed the power to inflict on them before the\r\nengagement, when they were yet uninjured, they were persuaded from his\r\nusual clemency and mercy, he never would have inflicted; that the power\r\nof the Bellovaci was crushed by the cavalry action; that many thousands\r\nof their choicest foot had fallen, that scarce a man had escaped to\r\nbring the fatal news. That, however, the Bellovaci had derived from the\r\nbattle one advantage, of some importance, considering their loss; that\r\nCorreus, the author of the rebellion, and agitator of the people, was\r\nslain: for that whilst he lived, the senate had never equal influence in\r\nthe state with the giddy populace.\r\n\r\nXXII.--Caesar reminded the ambassadors who made these supplications,\r\nthat the Bellovaci had at the same season the year before, in\r\nconjunction with other states of Gaul, undertaken a war, and that they\r\nhad persevered the most obstinately of all in their purpose, and were\r\nnot brought to a proper way of thinking by the submission of the rest;\r\nthat he knew and was aware that the guilt of a crime was easily\r\ntransferred to the dead; but that no one person could have such\r\ninfluence, as to be able by the feeble support of the multitude to raise\r\na war and carry it on without the consent of the nobles, in opposition\r\nto the senate, and in despite of every virtuous man; however he was\r\nsatisfied with the punishment which they had drawn upon themselves.\r\n\r\nXXIII.--The night following the ambassadors bring back his answer to\r\ntheir countrymen, and prepare the hostages. Ambassadors flock in from\r\nthe other states, which were waiting for the issue of the [war with the]\r\nBellovaci: they give hostages, and receive his orders; all except\r\nComius, whose fears restrained him from entrusting his safety to any\r\nperson's honour. For the year before, while Caesar was holding the\r\nassizes in Hither Gaul, Titus Labienus, having discovered that Comius\r\nwas tampering with the states, and raising a conspiracy against Caesar,\r\nthought he might punish his infidelity without perfidy; but judging that\r\nhe would not come to his camp at his invitation, and unwilling to put\r\nhim on his guard by the attempt, he sent Caius Volusenus Quadratus, with\r\norders to have him put to death under pretence of a conference. To\r\neffect his purpose, he sent with him some chosen centurions. When they\r\ncame to the conference, and Volusenus, as had been agreed on, had taken\r\nhold of Comius by the hand, and one of the centurions, as if surprised\r\nat so uncommon an incident, attempted to kill him, he was prevented by\r\nthe friends of Comius, but wounded him severely in the head by the first\r\nblow. Swords were drawn on both sides, not so much with a design to\r\nfight as to effect an escape, our men believing that Comius had received\r\na mortal stroke; and the Gauls, from the treachery which they had seen,\r\ndreading that a deeper design lay concealed. Upon this transaction, it\r\nwas said that Comius made a resolution never to come within sight of any\r\nRoman.\r\n\r\nXXIV.--When Caesar, having completely conquered the most warlike\r\nnations, perceived that there was now no state which could make\r\npreparations for war to oppose him, but that some were removing and\r\nfleeing from their country to avoid present subjection, he resolved to\r\ndetach his army into different parts of the country. He kept with\r\nhimself Marcus Antonius the quaestor, with the eleventh legion; Caius\r\nFabius was detached with twenty-five cohorts into the remotest part of\r\nGaul, because it was rumoured that some states had risen in arms, and he\r\ndid not think that Caius Caninius Rebilus, who had the charge of that\r\ncountry, was strong enough to protect it with two legions. He ordered\r\nTitus Labienus to attend himself, and sent the twelfth legion which had\r\nbeen under him in winter quarters, to Hither Gaul, to protect the Roman\r\ncolonies, and prevent any loss by the inroads of barbarians, similar to\r\nthat which had happened the year before to the Tergestines, who were cut\r\noff by a sudden depredation and attack. He himself marched to depopulate\r\nthe country of Ambiorix, whom he had terrified and forced to fly, but\r\ndespaired of being able to reduce under his power; but he thought it\r\nmost consistent with his honour to waste his country both of\r\ninhabitants, cattle, and buildings, so that from the abhorrence of his\r\ncountrymen, if fortune suffered any to survive, he might be excluded\r\nfrom a return to his state for the calamities which he had brought on\r\nit.\r\n\r\nXXV.--After he had sent either his legions or auxiliaries through every\r\npart of Ambiorix's dominions, and wasted the whole country by sword,\r\nfire, and rapine, and had killed or taken prodigious numbers, he sent\r\nLabienus with two legions against the Treviri, whose state, from its\r\nvicinity to Germany, being engaged in constant war, differed but little\r\nfrom the Germans, in civilization and savage barbarity; and never\r\ncontinued in its allegiance, except when awed by the presence of his\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nXXVI.--In the meantime Caius Caninius, a lieutenant, having received\r\ninformation by letters and messages from Duracius, who had always\r\ncontinued in friendship to the Roman people, though a part of his state\r\nhad revolted, that a great multitude of the enemy were in arms in the\r\ncountry of the Pictones, marched to the town Limonum. When he was\r\napproaching it, he was informed by some prisoners, that Duracius was\r\nshut up by several thousand men, under the command of Dumnacus, general\r\nof the Andes, and that Limonum was besieged, but not daring to face the\r\nenemy with his weak legions, he encamped in a strong position: Dumnacus,\r\nhaving notice of Caninius's approach, turned his whole force against the\r\nlegions, and prepared to assault the Roman camp. But after spending\r\nseveral days in the attempt, and losing a considerable number of men,\r\nwithout being able to make a breach in any part of the works, he\r\nreturned again to the siege of Limonum.\r\n\r\nXXVII.--At the same time, Caius Fabius, a lieutenant, brings back many\r\nstates to their allegiance, and confirms their submission by taking\r\nhostages; he was then informed by letters from Caninius, of the\r\nproceedings among the Pictones. Upon which he set off to bring\r\nassistance to Duracius. But Dumnacus hearing of the approach of Fabius,\r\nand despairing of safety, if at the same time he should be forced to\r\nwithstand the Roman army without, and observe, and be under apprehension\r\nfrom the town's people, made a precipitate retreat from that place with\r\nall his forces. Nor did he think that he should be sufficiently secure\r\nfrom danger, unless he led his army across the Loire, which was too deep\r\na river to pass except by a bridge. Though Fabius had not yet come\r\nwithin sight of the enemy, nor joined Caninius; yet being informed of\r\nthe nature of the country, by persons acquainted with it, he judged it\r\nmost likely that the enemy would take that way, which he found they did\r\ntake. He therefore marched to that bridge with his army, and ordered his\r\ncavalry to advance no further before the legions, than that they could\r\nreturn to the same camp at night, without fatiguing their horses. Our\r\nhorse pursued according to orders, and fell upon Dumnacus's rear, and\r\nattacking them on their march, while fleeing, dismayed, and laden with\r\nbaggage, they slew a great number, and took a rich booty. Having\r\nexecuted the affair so successfully, they retired to the camp.\r\n\r\nXXVIII.--The night following, Fabius sent his horse before him, with\r\norders to engage the enemy, and delay their march till he himself should\r\ncome up. That his orders might be faithfully performed, Quintus Atius\r\nVarus, general of the horse, a man of uncommon spirit and skill,\r\nencouraged his men, and pursuing the enemy, disposed some of his troops\r\nin convenient places, and with the rest gave battle to the enemy. The\r\nenemy's cavalry made a bold stand, the foot relieving each other, and\r\nmaking a general halt, to assist their horse against ours. The battle\r\nwas warmly contested. For our men, despising the enemy whom they had\r\nconquered the day before, and knowing that the legions were following\r\nthem, animated both by the disgrace of retreating, and a desire of\r\nconcluding the battle expeditiously by their own courage, fought most\r\nvaliantly against the foot: and the enemy, imagining that no more forces\r\nwould come against them, as they had experienced the day before, thought\r\nthey had got a favourable opportunity of destroying our whole cavalry.\r\n\r\nXXIX.-After the conflict had continued for some time with great\r\nviolence, Dumnacus drew out his army in such a manner, that the foot\r\nshould by turns assist the horse. Then the legions, marching in close\r\norder, came suddenly in sight of the enemy. At this sight, the barbarian\r\nhorse were so astonished, and the foot so terrified, that breaking\r\nthrough the line of baggage, they betook themselves to flight with a\r\nloud shout, and in great disorder. But our horse, who a little before\r\nhad vigorously engaged them, whilst they made resistance, being elated\r\nwith joy at their victory, raising a shout on every side, poured round\r\nthem as they ran, and as long as their horses had strength to pursue, or\r\ntheir arms to give a blow, so long did they continue the slaughter of\r\nthe enemy in that battle, and having killed above twelve thousand men in\r\narms, or such as threw away their arms through fear, they took their\r\nwhole train of baggage.\r\n\r\nXXX.--After this defeat, when it was ascertained that Drapes, a Senonian\r\n(who in the beginning of the revolt of Gaul, had collected from all\r\nquarters men of desperate fortunes, invited the slaves to liberty,\r\ncalled in the exiles of the whole kingdom, given an asylum to robbers,\r\nand intercepted the Roman baggage and provisions), was marching to the\r\nprovince with five thousand men, being all he could collect after the\r\ndefeat, and that Luterius a Cadurcian who, as it has been observed in a\r\nformer commentary, had designed to make an attack on the Province in the\r\nfirst revolt of Gaul, had formed a junction with him, Caius Caninius\r\nwent in pursuit of them with two legions, lest great disgrace might be\r\nincurred from the fears or injuries done to the Province by the\r\ndepredations of a band of desperate men.\r\n\r\nXXXI.--Caius Fabius set off with the rest of the army to the Carnutes\r\nand those other states, whose forces he was informed had served as\r\nauxiliaries in that battle, which he fought against Dumnacus. For he had\r\nno doubt that they would be more submissive after their recent\r\nsufferings, but if respite and time were given them, they might be\r\neasily excited by the earnest solicitations of the same Dumnacus. On\r\nthis occasion Fabius was extremely fortunate and expeditious in\r\nrecovering the states. For the Carnutes, who, though often harassed had\r\nnever mentioned peace, submitted and gave hostages: and the other\r\nstates, which lie in the remotest parts of Gaul, adjoining the ocean,\r\nand which are called Armoricae, influenced by the example of the\r\nCarnutes, as soon as Fabius arrived with his legions, without delay\r\ncomply with his command. Dumnacus, expelled from his own territories,\r\nwandering and skulking about, was forced to seek refuge by himself in\r\nthe most remote parts of Gaul.\r\n\r\nXXXII.--But Crapes in conjunction with Literius, knowing that Caninius\r\nwas at hand with the legions, and that they themselves could not without\r\ncertain destruction enter the boundaries of the province, whilst an army\r\nwas in pursuit of them, and being no longer at liberty to roam up and\r\ndown and pillage, halt in the country of the Cadurci, as Luterius had\r\nonce in his prosperity possessed a powerful influence over the\r\ninhabitants, who were his countrymen, and being always the author of new\r\nprojects, had considerable authority among the barbarians; with his own\r\nand Drapes' troops he seized Uxellodunum, a town formerly in vassalage\r\nto him and strongly fortified by its natural situation; and prevailed on\r\nthe inhabitants to join him.\r\n\r\nXXXIII.--After Caninius had rapidly marched to this place, and perceived\r\nthat all parts of the town were secured by very craggy rocks, which it\r\nwould be difficult for men in arms to climb even if they met with no\r\nresistance; and, moreover, observing that the town's people were\r\npossessed of effects, to a considerable amount, and that if they\r\nattempted to convey them away in a clandestine manner, they could not\r\nescape our horse, nor even our legions; he divided his forces into three\r\nparts, and pitched three camps on very high ground, with the intention\r\nof drawing lines round the town by degrees, as his forces could bear the\r\nfatigue.\r\n\r\nXXXIV.--When the townsmen perceived his design, being terrified by the\r\nrecollection of the distress at Alesia, they began to dread similar\r\nconsequences from a siege; and above all Luterius, who had experienced\r\nthat fatal event, cautioned them to make provision of corn; they\r\ntherefore resolve by general consent to leave part of their troops\r\nbehind, and set out with their light troops to bring in corn. The scheme\r\nhaving met with approbation, the following night Drapes and Luterius,\r\nleaving two thousand men in the garrison, marched out of the town with\r\nthe rest. After a few days' stay in the country of the Cadurci (some of\r\nwhom were disposed to assist them with corn, and others were unable to\r\nprevent their taking it) they collected a great store. Sometimes also\r\nattacks were made on our little forts by sallies at night. For this\r\nreason Caninius deferred drawing his works round the whole town, lest he\r\nshould be unable to protect them when completed, or by disposing his\r\ngarrisons in several places, should make them too weak.\r\n\r\nXXXV.--Drapes and Luterius, having laid in a large supply of corn,\r\noccupy a position at about ten miles distance from the town, intending\r\nfrom it to convey the corn into the town by degrees. They chose each his\r\nrespective department. Drapes stayed behind in the camp with part of the\r\narmy to protect it; Luterius conveys the train with provisions into the\r\ntown. Accordingly, having disposed guards here and there along the road,\r\nabout the tenth hour of the night, he set out by narrow paths through\r\nthe woods, to fetch the corn into the town. But their noise being heard\r\nby the sentinels of our camp, and the scouts which we had sent out,\r\nhaving brought an account of what was going on, Caninius instantly with\r\nthe ready-armed cohorts from the nearest turrets made an attack on the\r\nconvoy at the break of day. They, alarmed at so unexpected an evil, fled\r\nby different ways to their guard: which as soon as our men perceived,\r\nthey fell with great fury on the escort, and did not allow a single man\r\nto be taken alive. Luterius escaped thence with a few followers, but did\r\nnot return to the camp.\r\n\r\nXXXVI.--After this success, Caninius learnt from some prisoners, that a\r\npart of the forces was encamped with Drapes, not more than ten miles\r\noff; which being confirmed by several, supposing that after the defeat\r\nof one general, the rest would be terrified, and might be easily\r\nconquered, he thought it a most fortunate event that none of the enemy\r\nhad fled back from the slaughter to the camp, to give Drapes notice of\r\nthe calamity which had befallen him. And as he could see no danger in\r\nmaking the attempt, he sent forward all his cavalry and the German foot,\r\nmen of great activity, to the enemy's camp. He divides one legion among\r\nthe three camps, and takes the other without baggage along with him.\r\nWhen he had advanced near the enemy, he was informed by scouts, which he\r\nhad sent before him, that the enemy's camp, as is the custom of\r\nbarbarians, was pitched low, near the banks of a river, and that the\r\nhigher grounds were unoccupied: but that the German horse had made a\r\nsudden attack on them, and had begun the battle. Upon this intelligence,\r\nhe marched up with his legion, armed and in order of battle. Then, on a\r\nsignal being suddenly given on every side, our men took possession of\r\nthe higher grounds. Upon this, the German horse observing the Roman\r\ncolours, fought with great vigour. Immediately all the cohorts attack\r\nthem on every side; and having either killed or made prisoners of them\r\nall, gained great booty. In that battle, Drapes himself was taken\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nXXXVII.--Caninius, having accomplished the business so successfully,\r\nwithout having scarcely a man wounded, returned to besiege the town;\r\nand, having destroyed the enemy without, for fear of whom he had been\r\nprevented from strengthening his redoubts, and surrounding the enemy\r\nwith his lines, he orders the work to be completed on every side. The\r\nnext day, Caius Fabius came to join him with his forces, and took upon\r\nhim the siege of one side.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII.--In the meantime, Caesar left Caius Antonius in the country of\r\nthe Bellovaci, with fifteen cohorts, that the Belgae might have no\r\nopportunity of forming new plans in future. He himself visits the other\r\nstates, demands a great number of hostages, and by his encouraging\r\nlanguage allays the apprehensions of all. When he came to the Carnutes,\r\nin whose state he has in a former commentary mentioned that the war\r\nfirst broke out; observing, that from a consciousness of their guilt,\r\nthey seemed to be in the greatest terror: to relieve the state the\r\nsooner from its fear, he demanded that Guturvatus, the promoter of that\r\ntreason, and the instigator of that rebellion, should be delivered up to\r\npunishment. And though the latter did not dare to trust his life even to\r\nhis own countrymen, yet such diligent search was made by them all, that\r\nhe was soon brought to our camp. Caesar was forced to punish him, by the\r\nclamours of the soldiers, contrary to his natural humanity, for they\r\nalleged that all the dangers and losses incurred in that war, ought to\r\nbe imputed to Guturvatus. Accordingly, he was whipped to death, and his\r\nhead cut off.\r\n\r\nXXXIX.--Here Caesar was informed by numerous letters from Caninius of\r\nwhat had happened to Drapes and Luterius, and in what conduct the town's\r\npeople persisted: and though he despised the smallness of their numbers,\r\nyet he thought their obstinacy deserving a severe punishment, lest Gaul\r\nin general should adopt an idea that she did not want strength but\r\nperseverance to oppose the Romans; and lest the other states, relying on\r\nthe advantage of situation, should follow their example and assert their\r\nliberty; especially as he knew that all the Gauls understood that his\r\ncommand was to continue but one summer longer, and if they could hold\r\nout for that time, that they would have no further danger to apprehend.\r\nHe therefore left Quintus Calenus, one of his lieutenants behind him,\r\nwith two legions, and instructions to follow him by regular marches. He\r\nhastened as much as he could with all the cavalry to Caninius.\r\n\r\nXL.--Having arrived at Uxellodunum, contrary to the general expectation,\r\nand perceiving that the town was surrounded by the works, and that the\r\nenemy had no possible means of retiring from the assault, and being\r\nlikewise informed by the deserters that the townsmen had abundance of\r\ncorn; he endeavoured to prevent their getting water. A river divided the\r\nvalley below, which almost surrounded the steep craggy mountain on which\r\nUxellodunum was built. The nature of the ground prevented his turning\r\nthe current; for it ran so low down at the foot of the mountain, that no\r\ndrains could be sunk deep enough to draw it off in any direction. But\r\nthe descent to it was so difficult, that if we made opposition, the\r\nbesieged could neither come to the river, nor retire up the precipice\r\nwithout hazard of their lives. Caesar, perceiving the difficulty,\r\ndisposed archers and slingers, and in some places, opposite to the\r\neasiest descents, placed engines, and attempted to hinder the townsmen\r\nfrom getting water at the river, which obliged them afterwards to go all\r\nto one place to procure water.\r\n\r\nXLI.--Close under the walls of the town, a copious spring gushed out on\r\nthat part, which for the space of nearly three hundred feet, was not\r\nsurrounded by the river. Whilst every other person wished that the\r\nbesieged could be debarred from this spring, Caesar alone saw that it\r\ncould be effected, though not without great danger. Opposite to it he\r\nbegan to advance the vineae towards the mountain, and to throw up a\r\nmound, with great labour and continual skirmishing. For the townsmen ran\r\ndown from the high ground, and fought without any risk, and wounded\r\nseveral of our men, yet they obstinately pushed on and were not deterred\r\nfrom moving forward the vineae, and from surmounting by their assiduity\r\nthe difficulties of situation. At the same time they work mines, and\r\nmove the crates and vineae to the source of the fountain. This was the\r\nonly work which they could do without danger or suspicion. A mound sixty\r\nfeet high was raised; on it was erected a turret of ten stories, not\r\nwith the intention that it should be on a level with the wall (for that\r\ncould not be effected by any works), but to rise above the top of the\r\nspring. When our engines began to play from it upon the paths that led\r\nto the fountain, and the townsmen could not go for water without danger,\r\nnot only the cattle designed for food and the working cattle, but a\r\ngreat number of men also died of thirst.\r\n\r\nXLII.--Alarmed at this calamity, the townsmen fill barrels with tallow,\r\npitch, and dried wood; these they set on fire, and roll down on our\r\nworks. At the same time, they fight most furiously, to deter the Romans,\r\nby the engagement and danger, from extinguishing the flames. Instantly a\r\ngreat blaze arose in the works. For whatever they threw down the\r\nprecipice, striking against the vine and agger, communicated the fire to\r\nwhatever was in the way. Our soldiers on the other hand, though they\r\nwere engaged in a perilous sort of encounter, and labouring under the\r\ndisadvantages of position, yet supported all with very great presence of\r\nmind. For the action happened in an elevated situation, and in sight of\r\nour army; and a great shout was raised on both sides; therefore every\r\nman faced the weapons of the enemy and the flames in as conspicuous a\r\nmanner as he could, that his valour might be the better known and\r\nattested.\r\n\r\nXLIII.--Caesar, observing that several of his men were wounded, ordered\r\nthe cohorts to ascend the mountain on all sides, and, under pretence of\r\nassailing the walls, to raise a shout: at which the besieged being\r\nfrightened, and not knowing what was going on in other places, call off\r\ntheir armed troops from attacking our works, and dispose them on the\r\nwalls. Thus our men, without hazarding a battle, gained time partly to\r\nextinguish the works which had caught fire, and partly to cut off the\r\ncommunication. As the townsmen still continued to make an obstinate\r\nresistance, and even, after losing the greatest part of their forces by\r\ndrought, persevered in their resolution: At last the veins of the spring\r\nwere cut across by our mines, and turned from their course. By this\r\ntheir constant spring was suddenly dried up, which reduced them to such\r\ndespair that they imagined that it was not done by the art of man, but\r\nthe will of the gods; forced, therefore, by necessity, they at length\r\nsubmitted.\r\n\r\nXLIV.--Caesar, being convinced that his lenity was known to all men, and\r\nbeing under no fears of being thought to act severely from a natural\r\ncruelty, and perceiving that there would be no end to his troubles if\r\nseveral states should attempt to rebel in like manner and in different\r\nplaces, resolved to deter others by inflicting an exemplary punishment\r\non these. Accordingly he cut off the hands of those who had borne arms\r\nagainst him. Their lives he spared, that the punishment of their\r\nrebellion might be the more conspicuous. Drapes, who I have said was\r\ntaken by Caninius, either through indignation and grief arising from his\r\ncaptivity, or through fear of severer punishments, abstained from food\r\nfor several days, and thus perished. At the same time, Luterius, who, I\r\nhave related, had escaped from the battle, having fallen into the hands\r\nof Epasnactus, an Arvernian (for he frequently changed his quarters, and\r\nthrew himself on the honour of several persons, as he saw that he dare\r\nnot remain long in one place, and was conscious how great an enemy he\r\ndeserved to have in Caesar), was by this Epasnactus, the Arvernian, a\r\nsincere friend of the Roman people, delivered without any hesitation, a\r\nprisoner to Caesar.\r\n\r\nXLV.--In the meantime, Labienus engages in a successful cavalry action\r\namong the Treviri; and, having killed several of them and of the\r\nGermans, who never refused their aid to any person against the Romans,\r\nhe got their chiefs alive into his power, and, amongst them, Surus, an\r\nAeduan, who was highly renowned both for his valour and birth, and was\r\nthe only Aeduan that had continued in arms till that time. Caesar, being\r\ninformed of this, and perceiving that he had met with good success in\r\nall parts of Gaul, and reflecting that, in former campaigns, [Celtic]\r\nGaul had been conquered and subdued; but that he had never gone in\r\nperson to Aquitania, but had made a conquest of it, in some degree, by\r\nMarcus Crassus, set out for it with two legions, designing to spend the\r\nlatter part of the summer there. This affair he executed with his usual\r\ndespatch and good fortune. For all the states of Aquitania sent\r\nambassadors to him and delivered hostages. These affairs being\r\nconcluded, he marched with a guard of cavalry towards Narbo, and drew\r\noff his army into winter quarters by his lieutenants. He posted four\r\nlegions in the country of the Belgae, under Marcus Antonius, Caius\r\nTrebonius, Publius Vatinius, and Quintus Tullius, his lieutenants. Two\r\nhe detached to the Aedui, knowing them to have a very powerful influence\r\nthroughout all Gaul. Two he placed among the Turoni, near the confines\r\nof the Carnutes, to keep in awe the entire tract of country bordering on\r\nthe ocean; the other two he placed in the territories of the Lemovices,\r\nat a small distance from the Arverni, that no part of Gaul might be\r\nwithout an army. Having spent a few days in the province, he quickly ran\r\nthrough all the business of the assizes, settled all public disputes,\r\nand distributed rewards to the most deserving; for he had a good\r\nopportunity of learning how every person was disposed towards the\r\nrepublic during the general revolt of Gaul, which he had withstood by\r\nthe fidelity and assistance of the Province.\r\n\r\nXLVII.--Having finished these affairs, he returned to his legions among\r\nthe Belgae and wintered at Nemetocenna: there he got intelligence that\r\nComius, the Atrebatian had had an engagement with his cavalry. For when\r\nAntonius had gone into winter quarters, and the state of the Atrebates\r\ncontinued in their allegiance, Comius, who, after that wound which I\r\nbefore mentioned, was always ready to join his countrymen upon every\r\ncommotion, that they might not want a person to advise and head them in\r\nthe management of the war, when his state submitted to the Romans,\r\nsupported himself and his adherents on plunder by means of his cavalry,\r\ninfested the roads, and intercepted several convoys which were bringing\r\nprovisions to the Roman quarters.\r\n\r\nXLVIII.--Caius Volusenus Quadratus was appointed commander of the horse\r\nunder Antonius, to winter with him: Antonius sent him in pursuit of the\r\nenemy's cavalry; now Volusenus added to that valour which was pre-eminent\r\nin him, a great aversion to Comius, on which account he executed\r\nthe more willingly the orders which he received. Having, therefore, laid\r\nambuscades, he had several encounters with his cavalry and came off\r\nsuccessful. At last, when a violent contest ensued, and Volusenus,\r\nthrough eagerness to intercept Comius, had obstinately pursued him with\r\na small party; and Comius had, by the rapidity of his flight, drawn\r\nVolusenus to a considerable distance from his troops, he, on a sudden,\r\nappealed to the honour of all about him for assistance not to suffer the\r\nwound, which he had perfidiously received, to go without vengeance; and,\r\nwheeling his horse about, rode unguardedly before the rest up to the\r\ncommander. All his horse following his example, made a few of our men\r\nturn their backs and pursued them. Comius, clapping spurs to his horse,\r\nrode up to Volusenus, and, pointing his lance, pierced him in the thigh\r\nwith great force. When their commander was wounded, our men no longer\r\nhesitated to make resistance, and, facing about, beat back the enemy.\r\nWhen this occurred, several of the enemy, repulsed by the great\r\nimpetuosity of our men, were wounded, and some were trampled to death in\r\nstriving to escape, and some were made prisoners. Their general escaped\r\nthis misfortune by the swiftness of his horse. Our commander, being\r\nseverely wounded, so much so that he appeared to run the risk of losing\r\nhis life, was carried back to the camp. But Comius, having either\r\ngratified his resentment, or, because he had lost the greatest part of\r\nhis followers, sent ambassadors to Antonius, and assured him that he\r\nwould give hostages as a security that he would go wherever Antonius\r\nshould prescribe, and would comply with his orders, and only entreated\r\nthat this concession should be made to his fears, that he should not be\r\nobliged to go into the presence of any Roman. As Antonius judged that\r\nhis request originated in a just apprehension, he indulged him in it and\r\naccepted his hostages.\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\nCaesar, I know, has made a separate commentary of each year's\r\ntransactions, which I have not thought it necessary for me to do,\r\nbecause the following year, in which Lucius Paulus and Caius Marcellus\r\nwere consuls, produced no remarkable occurrences in Gaul. But that no\r\nperson may be left in ignorance of the place where Caesar and his army\r\nwere at that time, I have thought proper to write a few words in\r\naddition to this commentary.\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\nXLIX.--Caesar, whilst in winter quarters in the country of the Belgae,\r\nmade it his only business to keep the states in amity with him, and to\r\ngive none either hopes of, or pretext for, a revolt. For nothing was\r\nfurther from his wishes than to be under the necessity of engaging in\r\nanother war at his departure; lest, when he was drawing his army out of\r\nthe country, any war should be left unfinished, which the Gauls would\r\ncheerfully undertake, when there was no immediate danger. Therefore, by\r\ntreating the states with respect, making rich presents to the leading\r\nmen, imposing no new burdens, and making the terms of their subjection\r\nlighter, he easily kept Gaul (already exhausted by so many unsuccessful\r\nbattles) in obedience.\r\n\r\nL.--When the winter quarters were broken up, he himself, contrary to his\r\nusual practice, proceeded to Italy, by the longest possible stages, in\r\norder to visit the free towns and colonies, that he might recommend to\r\nthem the petition of Marcus Antonius, his treasurer, for the priesthood.\r\nFor he exerted his interest both cheerfully in favour of a man strongly\r\nattached to him, whom he had sent home before him to attend the\r\nelection, and zealously to oppose the faction and power of a few men,\r\nwho, by rejecting Marcus Antonius, wished to undermine Caesar's\r\ninfluence when going out of office. Though Caesar heard on the road,\r\nbefore he reached Italy, that he was created augur, yet he thought\r\nhimself in honour bound to visit the free town and colonies, to return\r\nthem thanks for rendering such service to Antonius by their presence in\r\nsuch great numbers [at the election], and at the same time to recommend\r\nto them himself, and his honour in his suit for the consulate the\r\nensuing year. For his adversaries arrogantly boasted that Lucius\r\nLentulus and Caius Marcellus had been appointed consuls, who would strip\r\nCaesar of all honour and dignity: and that the consulate had been\r\ninjuriously taken from Sergius Galba, though he had been much superior\r\nin votes and interest, because he was united to Caesar, both by\r\nfriendship, and by serving as lieutenant under him.\r\n\r\nLI.--Caesar, on his arrival, was received by the principal towns and\r\ncolonies with incredible respect and affection; for this was the first\r\ntime he came since the war against united Gaul. Nothing was omitted\r\nwhich could be thought of for the ornament of the gates, roads, and\r\nevery place through which Caesar was to pass. All the people with their\r\nchildren went out to meet him. Sacrifices were offered up in every\r\nquarter. The market places and temples were laid out with\r\nentertainments, as if anticipating the joy of a most splendid triumph.\r\nSo great was the magnificence of the richer and zeal of the poorer ranks\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nLII.--When Caesar had gone through all the states of Cisalpine Gaul, he\r\nreturned with the greatest haste to the army at Nemetocenna; and having\r\nordered all his legions to march from winter quarters to the territories\r\nof the Treviri, he went thither and reviewed them. He made Titus\r\nLabienus governor of Cisalpine Gaul, that he might be the more inclined\r\nto support him in his suit for the consulate. He himself made such\r\njourneys, as he thought would conduce to the health of his men by change\r\nof air; and though he was frequently told that Labienus was solicited by\r\nhis enemies, and was assured that a scheme was in agitation by the\r\ncontrivance of a few, that the senate should interpose their authority\r\nto deprive him of a part of his army; yet he neither gave credit to any\r\nstory concerning Labienus, nor could be prevailed upon to do anything in\r\nopposition to the authority of the senate; for he thought that his cause\r\nwould be easily gained by the free voice of the senators. For Caius\r\nCurio, one of the tribunes of the people, having undertaken to defend\r\nCaesar's cause and dignity, had often proposed to the senate, \"that if\r\nthe dread of Caesar's arms rendered any apprehensive, as Pompey's\r\nauthority and arms were no less formidable to the forum, both should\r\nresign their command, and disband their armies. That then the city would\r\nbe free, and enjoy its due rights.\" And he not only proposed this, but\r\nof himself called upon the senate to divide on the question. But the\r\nconsuls and Pompey's friends interposed to prevent it; and regulating\r\nmatters as they desired, they broke up the meeting.\r\n\r\nLIII.--This testimony of the unanimous voice of the senate was very\r\ngreat, and consistent with their former conduct; for the preceding year,\r\nwhen Marcellus attacked Caesar's dignity, he proposed to the senate,\r\ncontrary to the law of Pompey and Crassus, to dispose of Caesar's\r\nprovince, before the expiration of his command, and when the votes were\r\ncalled for, and Marcellus, who endeavoured to advance his own dignity,\r\nby raising envy against Caesar, wanted a division, the full senate went\r\nover to the opposite side. The spirit of Caesar's foes was not broken by\r\nthis, but it taught them, that they ought to strengthen their interest\r\nby enlarging their connections, so as to force the senate to comply with\r\nwhatever they resolved on.\r\n\r\nLIV.--After this a decree was passed by the senate, that one legion\r\nshould be sent by Pompey, and another by Caesar, to the Parthian war.\r\nBut these two legions were evidently drawn from Caesar alone. For the\r\nfirst legion which Pompey sent to Caesar, he gave Caesar, as if it\r\nbelonged to himself, though it was levied in Caesar's province. Caesar,\r\nhowever, though no one could doubt the design of his enemies, sent the\r\nlegion back to Cneius Pompey, and in compliance with the decree of the\r\nsenate, ordered the fifteenth, belonging to himself, and which was\r\nquartered in Cisalpine Gaul, to be delivered up. In its room he sent the\r\nthirteenth into Italy, to protect the garrisons from which he had\r\ndrafted the fifteenth. He disposed his army in winter quarters, placed\r\nCaius Trebonius, with four legions among the Belgae, and detached Caius\r\nFabius, with four more, to the Aedui; for he thought that Gaul would be\r\nmost secure if the Belgae, a people of the greatest valour, and the\r\nAedui, who possessed the most powerful influence, were kept in awe by\r\nhis armies.\r\n\r\nLV.--He himself set out for Italy; where he was informed on his arrival,\r\nthat the two legions sent home by him, and which by the senate's decree,\r\nshould have been sent to the Parthian war, had been delivered over to\r\nPompey, by Caius Marcellus the consul, and were retained in Italy.\r\nAlthough from this transaction it was evident to every one that war was\r\ndesigned against Caesar, yet he resolved to submit to any thing, as long\r\nas there were hopes left of deciding the dispute in an equitable manner,\r\nrather than have recourse to arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL WAR\r\n\r\nBOOK I\r\n\r\nI.--When Caesar's letter was delivered to the consuls, they were with\r\ngreat difficulty, and a hard struggle of the tribunes, prevailed on to\r\nsuffer it to be read in the senate; but the tribunes could not prevail,\r\nthat any question should be put to the senate on the subject of the\r\nletter. The consuls put the question on the regulation of the state.\r\nLucius Lentulus the consul promises that he will not fail the senate and\r\nrepublic, \"if they declared their sentiments boldly and resolutely, but\r\nif they turned their regard to Caesar, and courted his favour, as they\r\ndid on former occasions, he would adopt a plan for himself, and not\r\nsubmit to the authority of the senate: that he too had a means of\r\nregaining Caesar's favour and friendship.\" Scipio spoke to the same\r\npurport, \"that it was Pompey's intention not to abandon the republic, if\r\nthe senate would support him; but if they should hesitate and act\r\nwithout energy, they would in vain implore his aid, if they should\r\nrequire it hereafter.\"\r\n\r\nII.--This speech of Scipio's, as the senate was convened in the city,\r\nand Pompey was near at hand, seemed to have fallen from the lips of\r\nPompey himself. Some delivered their sentiments with more moderation, as\r\nMarcellus first, who in the beginning of his speech, said, \"that the\r\nquestion ought not to be put to the senate on this matter, till levies\r\nwere made throughout all Italy, and armies raised under whose protection\r\nthe senate might freely and safely pass such resolutions as they thought\r\nproper\": as Marcus Calidius afterwards, who was of opinion, \"that Pompey\r\nshould set out for his province, that there might be no cause for arms:\r\nthat Caesar was naturally apprehensive as two legions were forced from\r\nhim, that Pompey was retaining those troops, and keeping them near the\r\ncity to do him injury\": as Marcus Rufus, who followed Calidius almost\r\nword for word. They were all harshly rebuked by Lentulus, who\r\nperemptorily refused to propose Calidius's motion. Marcellus, overawed\r\nby his reproofs, retracted his opinion. Thus most of the senate,\r\nintimidated by the expressions of the consul, by the fears of a present\r\narmy, and the threats of Pompey's friends, unwillingly and reluctantly\r\nadopted Scipio's opinion, that Caesar should disband his army by a\r\ncertain day, and should he not do so, he should be considered as acting\r\nagainst the state. Marcus Antonius, and Quintus Cassius, tribunes of the\r\npeople, interposed. The question was immediately put on their\r\ninterposition. Violent opinions were expressed: whoever spoke with the\r\ngreatest acrimony and cruelty, was most highly commended by Caesar's\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nIII.--The senate having broken up in the evening, all who belonged to\r\nthat order were summoned by Pompey. He applauded the forward, and\r\nsecured their votes for the next day; the more moderate he reproved and\r\nexcited against Caesar. Many veterans, from all parts, who had served in\r\nPompey's armies, were invited to his standard by the hopes of rewards\r\nand promotions. Several officers belonging to the two legions, which had\r\nbeen delivered up by Caesar, were sent for. The city and the Comitium\r\nwere crowded with tribunes, centurions, and veterans. All the consuls'\r\nfriends, all Pompey's connections, all those who bore any ancient enmity\r\nto Caesar, were forced into the senate house. By their concourse and\r\ndeclarations the timid were awed, the irresolute confirmed, and the\r\ngreater part deprived of the power of speaking their sentiments with\r\nfreedom. Lucius Piso, the censor, offered to go to Caesar: as did\r\nlikewise Lucius Roscius, the praetor, to inform him of these affairs,\r\nand require only six days' time to finish the business. Opinions were\r\nexpressed by some to the effect that commissioners should be sent to\r\nCaesar to acquaint him with the senate's pleasure.\r\n\r\nIV.--All these proposals were rejected, and opposition made to them all,\r\nin the speeches of the consul, Scipio, and Cato. An old grudge against\r\nCaesar and chagrin at a defeat actuated Cato. Lentulus was wrought upon\r\nby the magnitude of his debts, and the hopes of having the government of\r\nan army and provinces, and by the presents which he expected from such\r\nprinces as should receive the title of friends of the Roman people, and\r\nboasted amongst his friends, that he would be a second Sylla, to whom\r\nthe supreme authority should return. Similar hopes of a province and\r\narmies, which he expected to share with Pompey on account of his\r\nconnection with him, urged on Scipio; and moreover, [he was influenced\r\nby] the fear of being called to trial, and the adulation and an\r\nostentatious display of himself and his friends in power, who at that\r\ntime had great influence in the republic, and courts of judicature.\r\nPompey himself, incited by Caesar's enemies, because he was unwilling\r\nthat any person should bear an equal degree of dignity, had wholly\r\nalienated himself from Caesar's friendship, and procured a\r\nreconciliation with their common enemies; the greatest part of whom he\r\nhad himself brought upon Caesar during his affinity with him. At the\r\nsame time, chagrined at the disgrace which he had incurred by converting\r\nthe two legions from their expedition through Asia and Syria, to\r\n[augment] his own power and authority, he was anxious to bring matters\r\nto a war.\r\n\r\nV.--For these reasons everything was done in a hasty and disorderly\r\nmanner, and neither was time given to Caesar's relations to inform him\r\n[of the state of affairs] nor liberty to the tribunes of the people to\r\ndeprecate their own danger, nor even to retain the last privilege, which\r\nSylla had left them, the interposing their authority; but on the seventh\r\nday they were obliged to think of their own safety, which the most\r\nturbulent tribunes of the people were not accustomed to attend to, nor\r\nto fear being called to an account for their actions, till the eighth\r\nmonth. Recourse is had to that extreme and final decree of the senate\r\n(which was never resorted to even by daring proposers except when the\r\ncity was in danger of being set on fire, or when the public safety was\r\ndespaired of). \"That the consuls, praetors, tribunes of the people, and\r\nproconsuls in the city should take care that the state received no\r\ninjury.\" These decrees are dated the eighth day before the ides of\r\nJanuary; therefore, in the first five days, on which the senate could\r\nmeet, from the day on which Lentulus entered into his consulate, the two\r\ndays of election excepted, the severest and most virulent decrees were\r\npassed against Caesar's government, and against those most illustrious\r\ncharacters, the tribunes of the people. The latter immediately made\r\ntheir escape from the city, and withdrew to Caesar, who was then at\r\nRavenna, awaiting an answer to his moderate demands; [to see] if matters\r\ncould be brought to a peaceful termination by any equitable act on the\r\npart of the enemies.\r\n\r\nVI.--During the succeeding days the senate is convened outside the city.\r\nPompey repeated the same things which he had declared through Scipio. He\r\napplauded the courage and firmness of the senate, acquainted them with\r\nhis force, and told them that he had ten legions ready; that he was\r\nmoreover informed and assured that Caesar's soldiers were disaffected,\r\nand that he could not persuade them to defend or even follow him.\r\nMotions were made in the senate concerning other matters; that levies\r\nshould be made through all Italy; that Faustus Sylla should be sent as\r\npropraetor into Mauritania; that money should be granted to Pompey from\r\nthe public treasury. It was also put to the vote that king Juba should\r\nbe [honoured with the title of] friend and ally. But Marcellus said that\r\nhe would not allow this motion for the present. Philip, one of the\r\ntribunes, stopped [the appointment of] Sylla; the resolutions respecting\r\nthe other matters passed. The provinces, two of which were consular, the\r\nremainder praetorian, were decreed to private persons; Scipio got Syria,\r\nLucius Domitius Gaul: Philip and Marcellus were omitted, from a private\r\nmotive, and their lots were not even admitted. To the other provinces\r\npraetors were sent, nor was time granted as in former years, to refer to\r\nthe people on their appointment, nor to make them take the usual oath,\r\nand march out of the city in a public manner, robed in the military\r\nhabit, after offering their vows; a circumstance which had never before\r\nhappened. Both the consuls leave the city, and private men had lictors\r\nin the city and capital, contrary to all precedents of former times.\r\nLevies were made throughout Italy, arms demanded, and money exacted from\r\nthe municipal towns, and violently taken from the temples. All\r\ndistinctions between things human and divine are confounded.\r\n\r\nVII.--These things being made known to Caesar, he harangued his\r\nsoldiers; he reminded them \"of the wrongs done to him at all times by\r\nhis enemies, and complained that Pompey had been alienated from him and\r\nled astray by them through envy and a malicious opposition to his glory,\r\nthough he had always favoured and promoted Pompey's honour and dignity.\r\nHe complained that an innovation had been introduced into the republic,\r\nthat the intercession of the tribunes, which had been restored a few\r\nyears before by Sylla, was branded as a crime, and suppressed by force\r\nof arms; that Sylla, who had stripped the tribunes of every other power,\r\nhad, nevertheless, left the privilege of intercession unrestrained; that\r\nPompey, who pretended to restore what they had lost, had taken away the\r\nprivileges which they formerly had; that whenever the senate decreed,\r\n\"that the magistrates should take care that the republic sustained no\r\ninjury\" (by which words and decree the Roman people were obliged to\r\nrepair to arms), it was only when pernicious laws were proposed; when\r\nthe tribunes attempted violent measures; when the people seceded, and\r\npossessed themselves of the temples and eminences of the city; (and\r\nthese instances of former times, he showed them were expiated by the\r\nfate of Saturninus and the Gracchi): that nothing of this kind was\r\nattempted now, nor even thought of: that no law was promulgated, no\r\nintrigue with the people going forward, no secession made; he exhorted\r\nthem to defend from the malice of his enemies, the reputation and honour\r\nof that general, under whose command they had for nine years most\r\nsuccessfully supported the state; fought many successful battles, and\r\nsubdued all Gaul and Germany.\" The soldiers of the thirteenth legion,\r\nwhich was present (for in the beginning of the disturbances he had\r\ncalled it out, his other legions not having yet arrived), all cry out\r\nthat they are ready to defend their general, and the tribunes of the\r\ncommons, from all injuries.\r\n\r\nVIII.--Having made himself acquainted with the disposition of his\r\nsoldiers, Caesar set off with that legion to Ariminum, and there met the\r\ntribunes, who had fled to him for protection; he called his other\r\nlegions from winter quarters, and ordered them to follow him. Thither\r\ncame Lucius Caesar, a young man, whose father was a lieutenant general\r\nunder Caesar. He, after concluding the rest of his speech, and stating\r\nfor what purpose he had come, told Caesar that he had commands of a\r\nprivate nature for him from Pompey; that Pompey wished to clear himself\r\nto Caesar, lest he should impute those actions which he did for the\r\nrepublic, to a design of affronting him; that he had ever preferred the\r\ninterest of the state to his own private connections; that Caesar, too,\r\nfor his own honour, ought to sacrifice his desires and resentment to the\r\npublic good, and not vent his anger so violently against his enemies,\r\nlest in his hopes of injuring them, he should injure the republic. He\r\nspoke a few words to the same purport from himself, in addition to\r\nPompey's apology. Roscius, the praetor, conferred with Caesar almost in\r\nthe same words, and on the same subject, and declared that Pompey had\r\nempowered him to do so.\r\n\r\nIX.--Though these things seemed to have no tendency towards redressing\r\nhis injuries, yet having got proper persons by whom he could communicate\r\nhis wishes to Pompey; he required of them both, that as they had\r\nconveyed Pompey's demands to him, they should not refuse to convey his\r\ndemands to Pompey; if by so little trouble they could terminate a great\r\ndispute, and liberate all Italy from her fears.\r\n\r\n\"That the honour of the republic had ever been his first object, and\r\ndearer to him than life; that he was chagrined, that the favour of the\r\nRoman people was wrested from him by the injurious reports of his\r\nenemies; that he was deprived of a half-year's command, and dragged back\r\nto the city, though the people had ordered that regard should be paid to\r\nhis suit for the consulate at the next election, though he was not\r\npresent; that, however, he had patiently submitted to this loss of\r\nhonour for the sake of the republic; that when he wrote letters to the\r\nsenate, requiring that all persons should resign the command of their\r\narmies, he did not obtain even that request; that levies were made\r\nthroughout Italy; that the two legions which had been taken from him,\r\nunder the pretence of the Parthian war, were kept at home, and that the\r\nstate was in arms. To what did all these things tend, unless to his\r\nruin? But, nevertheless, he was ready to condescend to any terms, and to\r\nendure everything for the sake of the republic. Let Pompey go to his own\r\nprovince; let them both disband their armies; let all persons in Italy\r\nlay down their arms; let all fears be removed from the city; let free\r\nelections, and the whole republic be resigned to the direction of the\r\nsenate and Roman people. That these things might be the more easily\r\nperformed, and conditions secured and confirmed by oath, either let\r\nPompey come to Caesar, or allow Caesar to go to him; it might be that\r\nall their disputes would be settled by an interview.\"\r\n\r\nX.--Roscius and Lucius Caesar, having received this message, went to\r\nCapua, where they met the consuls and Pompey, and declared to them\r\nCaesar's terms. Having deliberated on the matter, they replied, and sent\r\nwritten proposals to him by the same persons, the purport of which was,\r\nthat Caesar should return into Gaul, leave Ariminum, and disband his\r\narmy: if he complied with this, that Pompey would go to Spain. In the\r\nmeantime, until security was given that Caesar would perform his\r\npromises, that the consuls and Pompey would not give over their levies.\r\n\r\nXI.--It was not an equitable proposal, to require that Caesar should\r\nquit Ariminum and return to his province; but that he [Pompey] should\r\nhimself retain his province and the legions that belonged to another,\r\nand desire that Caesar's army should be disbanded, whilst he himself was\r\nmaking new levies: and that he should merely promise to go to his\r\nprovince, without naming the day on which he would set out; so that if\r\nhe should not set out till after Caesar's consulate expired, yet he\r\nwould not appear bound by any religious scruples about asserting a\r\nfalsehood. But his not granting time for a conference, nor promising to\r\nset out to meet him, made the expectation of peace appear very hopeless.\r\nCaesar, therefore, sent Marcus Antonius, with five cohorts from Ariminum\r\nto Arretium; he himself stayed at Ariminum with two legions, with the\r\nintention of raising levies there. He secured Pisaurus, Fanum, and\r\nAncona, with a cohort each.\r\n\r\nXII.--In the meantime, being informed that Thermus the praetor was in\r\npossession of Iguvium, with five cohorts, and was fortifying the town,\r\nbut that the affections of all the inhabitants were very well inclined\r\ntowards himself; he detached Curio with three cohorts, which he had at\r\nAriminum and Pisaurus. Upon notice of his approach, Thermus, distrusting\r\nthe affections of the townsmen, drew his cohorts out of it, and made his\r\nescape; his soldiers deserted him on the road, and returned home. Curio\r\nrecovered Iguvium, with the cheerful concurrence of all the inhabitants.\r\nCaesar, having received an account of this, and relying on the\r\naffections of the municipal towns, drafted all the cohorts of the\r\nthirteenth legion from the garrisons, and set out for Auximum, a town\r\ninto which Attius had brought his cohorts, and of which he had taken\r\npossession, and from which he had sent senators round about the country\r\nof Picenum, to raise new levies.\r\n\r\nXIII.--Upon news of Caesar's approach, the senate of Auximum went in a\r\nbody to Attius Varus; and told him that it was not a subject for them to\r\ndetermine upon: yet neither they, nor the rest of the freemen would\r\nsuffer Caius Caesar, a general, who had merited so well of the republic,\r\nafter performing such great achievements, to be excluded from their town\r\nand walls; wherefore he ought to pay some regard to the opinion of\r\nposterity, and his own danger. Alarmed at this declaration, Attius Varus\r\ndrew out of the town the garrison which he had introduced, and fled. A\r\nfew of Caesar's front rank having pursued him, obliged him to halt, and\r\nwhen the battle began, Varus is deserted by his troops: some of them\r\ndisperse to their homes, the rest come over to Caesar; and along with\r\nthem, Lucius Pupius, the chief centurion, is taken prisoner and brought\r\nto Caesar. He had held the same rank before in Cneius Pompey's army. But\r\nCaesar applauded the soldiers of Attius, set Pupius at liberty, returned\r\nthanks to the people of Auximum, and promised to be grateful for their\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nXIV.--Intelligence of this being brought to Rome, so great a panic\r\nspread on a sudden that when Lentulus, the consul, came to open the\r\ntreasury, to deliver money to Pompey by the senate's decree, immediately\r\non opening the hallowed door he fled from the city. For it was falsely\r\nrumoured that Caesar was approaching, and that his cavalry were already\r\nat the gates. Marcellus, his colleague, followed him, and so did most of\r\nthe magistrates. Cneius Pompey had left the city the day before, and was\r\non his march to those legions which he had received from Caesar, and had\r\ndisposed in winter quarters in Apulia. The levies were stopped within\r\nthe city. No place on this side of Capua was thought secure. At Capua\r\nthey first began to take courage and to rally, and determined to raise\r\nlevies in the colonies, which had been sent thither by the Julian law:\r\nand Lentulus brought into the public market-place the gladiators which\r\nCaesar maintained there for the entertainment of the people, and\r\nconfirmed them in their liberty, and gave them horses and ordered them\r\nto attend him; but afterwards, being warned by his friends that this\r\naction was censured by the judgment of all, he distributed them among\r\nthe slaves of the districts of Campania, to keep guard there.\r\n\r\nXV.--Caesar, having moved forward from Auximum, traversed the whole\r\ncountry of Picenum. All the governors in these countries most cheerfully\r\nreceived him, and aided his army with every necessary. Ambassadors came\r\nto him even from Cingulum, a town which Labienus had laid out and built\r\nat his own expense, and offered most earnestly to comply with his\r\norders. He demanded soldiers: they sent them. In the meantime, the\r\ntwelfth legion came to join Caesar; with these two he marched to\r\nAsculum, the chief town of Picenum. Lentulus Spinther occupied that town\r\nwith ten cohorts; but, on being informed of Caesar's approach, he fled\r\nfrom the town, and, in attempting to bring off his cohorts with him, was\r\ndeserted by a great part of his men. Being left on the road with a small\r\nnumber, he fell in with Vibullius Rufus, who was sent by Pompey into\r\nPicenum to confirm the people [in their allegiance]. Vibullius, being\r\ninformed by him of the transactions in Picenum, takes his soldiers from\r\nhim and dismisses him. He collects, likewise, from the neighbouring\r\ncountries, as many cohorts as he can from Pompey's new levies. Amongst\r\nthem he meets with Ulcilles Hirrus fleeing from Camerinum, with six\r\ncohorts, which he had in the garrison there; by a junction with which he\r\nmade up thirteen cohorts. With them he marched by hasty journeys to\r\nCorfinium, to Domitius Aenobarbus, and informed him that Caesar was\r\nadvancing with two legions. Domitius had collected about twenty cohorts\r\nfrom Alba, and the Marsians, Pelignians, and neighbouring states.\r\n\r\nXVI.--Caesar, having recovered Asculum and driven out Lentulus, ordered\r\nthe soldiers that had deserted from him to be sought out and a muster to\r\nbe made; and, having delayed for one day there to provide corn, he\r\nmarched to Corfinium. On his approach, five cohorts, sent by Domitius\r\nfrom the town, were breaking down a bridge which was over the river, at\r\nthree miles' distance from it. An engagement taking place there with\r\nCaesar's advanced-guard, Domitius's men were quickly beaten off from the\r\nbridge and retreated precipitately into the town. Caesar, having marched\r\nhis legions over, halted before the town and encamped close by the\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nXVII.--Domitius, upon observing this, sent messengers well acquainted\r\nwith the country, encouraged by a promise of being amply rewarded, with\r\ndespatches to Pompey to Apulia, to beg and entreat him to come to his\r\nassistance. That Caesar could be easily enclosed by the two armies,\r\nthrough the narrowness of the country, and prevented from obtaining\r\nsupplies: unless he did so, that he and upwards of thirty cohorts, and a\r\ngreat number of senators and Roman knights, would be in extreme danger.\r\nIn the meantime he encouraged his troops, disposed engines on the walls,\r\nand assigned to each man a particular part of the city to defend. In a\r\nspeech to the soldiers he promised them lands out of his own estate; to\r\nevery private soldier four acres, and a corresponding share to the\r\ncenturions and veterans.\r\n\r\nXVIII.--In the meantime, word was brought to Caesar that the people of\r\nSulmo, a town about seven miles distant from Corfinium, were ready to\r\nobey his orders, but were prevented by Quintus Lucretius, a senator, and\r\nAttius, a Pelignian, who were in possession of the town with a garrison\r\nof seven cohorts. He sent Marcus Antonius thither, with five cohorts of\r\nthe eighth legion. The inhabitants, as soon as they saw our standards,\r\nthrew open their gates, and all the people, both citizens and soldiers,\r\nwent out to meet and welcome Antonius. Lucretius and Attius leaped off\r\nthe walls. Attius, being brought before Antonius, begged that he might\r\nbe sent to Caesar. Antonius returned the same day on which he had set\r\nout with the cohorts and Attius. Caesar added these cohorts to his own\r\narmy, and sent Attius away in safety. The three first days Caesar\r\nemployed in fortifying his camp with strong works, in bringing in corn\r\nfrom the neighbouring free towns, and waiting for the rest of his\r\nforces. Within the three days the eighth legion came to him, and\r\ntwenty-two cohorts of the new levies in Gaul, and about three hundred\r\nhorse from the king of Noricum. On their arrival he made a second camp\r\non another part of the town, and gave the command of it to Curio. He\r\ndetermined to surround the town with a rampart and turrets during the\r\nremainder of the time. Nearly at the time when the greatest part of the\r\nwork was completed, all the messengers sent to Pompey returned.\r\n\r\nXIX.--Having read Pompey's letter, Domitius, concealing the truth, gave\r\nout in council that Pompey would speedily come to their assistance; and\r\nencouraged them not to despond, but to provide everything necessary for\r\nthe defence of the town. He held private conferences with a few of his\r\nmost intimate friends, and determined on the design of fleeing. As\r\nDomitius's countenance did not agree with his words, and he did\r\neverything with more confusion and fear than he had shown on the\r\npreceding days, and as he had several private meetings with his friends,\r\ncontrary to his usual practice, in order to take their advice, and as he\r\navoided all public councils and assemblies of the people, the truth\r\ncould be no longer hid nor dissembled; for Pompey had written back in\r\nanswer, \"That he would not put matters to the last hazard; that Domitius\r\nhad retreated into the town of Corfinium, without either his advice or\r\nconsent. Therefore, if any opportunity should offer, he [Domitius]\r\nshould come to him with the whole force.\" But the blockade and works\r\nround the town prevented his escape.\r\n\r\nXX.--Domitius's design being noised abroad, the soldiers in Confinium\r\n[**error in original: should be CORFINIUM] early in the evening began to\r\nmutiny, and held a conference with each other by their tribunes and\r\ncenturions, and the most respectable amongst themselves: \"that they were\r\nbesieged by Caesar; that his works and fortifications were almost\r\nfinished; that their general, Domitius, on whose hopes and expectations\r\nthey had confided, had thrown them off, and was meditating his own\r\nescape; that they ought to provide for their own safety.\" At first the\r\nMarsians differed in opinion, and possessed themselves of that part of\r\nthe town which they thought the strongest. And so violent a dispute\r\narose between them, that they attempted to fight and decide it by arms.\r\nHowever, in a little time, by messengers sent from one side to the\r\nother, they were informed of Domitius's meditated flight, of which they\r\nwere previously ignorant. Therefore they all with one consent brought\r\nDomitius into public view, gathered round him, and guarded him; and sent\r\ndeputies out of their number to Caesar, to say that they were ready to\r\nthrow open their gates, to do whatever he should order, and to deliver\r\nup Domitius alive into his hands.\r\n\r\nXXI.--Upon intelligence of these matters, though Caesar thought it of\r\ngreat consequence to become master of the town as soon as possible, and\r\nto transfer the cohorts to his own camp, lest any change should be\r\nwrought on their inclinations by bribes, encouragement, or fictitious\r\nmessages, because in war great events are often brought about by\r\ntrifling circumstances; yet, dreading lest the town should be plundered\r\nby the soldiers entering into it, and taking advantage of the darkness\r\nof the night, he commended the persons who came to him, and sent them\r\nback to the town, and ordered the gates and walls to be secured. He\r\ndisposed his soldiers on the works, which he had begun, not at certain\r\nintervals, as was his practice before, but in one continued range of\r\nsentinels and stations, so that they touched each other, and formed a\r\ncircle round the whole fortification; he ordered the tribunes and\r\ngeneral officers to ride round; and exhorted them not only to be on\r\ntheir guard against sallies from the town, but also to watch that no\r\nsingle person should get out privately. Nor was any man so negligent or\r\ndrowsy as to sleep that night. To so great height was their expectation\r\nraised, that they were carried away, heart and soul, each to different\r\nobjects, what would become of the Corfinians, what of Domitius, what of\r\nLentulus, what of the rest; what event would be the consequence of\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nXXII.--About the fourth watch, Lentulus Spinther said to our sentinels\r\nand guards from the walls, that he desired to have an interview with\r\nCaesar, if permission were given him. Having obtained it, he was\r\nescorted out of town; nor did the soldiers of Domitius leave him till\r\nthey brought him into Caesar's presence. He pleaded with Caesar for his\r\nlife, and entreated him to spare him, and reminded him of their former\r\nfriendship; and acknowledged that Caesar's favours to him were very\r\ngreat; in that through his interest he had been admitted into the\r\ncollege of priests; in that after his praetorship he had been appointed\r\nto the government of Spain; in that he had been assisted by him in his\r\nsuit for the consulate. Caesar interrupted him in his speech, and told\r\nhim, \"that he had not left his province to do mischief [to any man], but\r\nto protect himself from the injuries of his enemies; to restore to their\r\ndignity the tribunes of the people who had been driven out of the city\r\non his account, and to assert his own liberty, and that of the Roman\r\npeople, who were oppressed by a few factious men.\" Encouraged by this\r\naddress, Lentulus begged leave to return to the town, that the security\r\nwhich he had obtained for himself might be an encouragement to the rest\r\nto hope for theirs; saying that some were so terrified that they were\r\ninduced to make desperate attempts on their own lives. Leave being\r\ngranted him, he departed.\r\n\r\nXXIII.--When day appeared Caesar ordered all the senators and their\r\nchildren, the tribunes of the soldiers, and the Roman knights, to be\r\nbrought before him. Among the persons of senatorial rank were Lucius\r\nDomitius, Publius Lentulus Spinther, Lucius Vibullius Rufus, Sextus\r\nQuintilius Varus, the quaestor, and Lucius Rubrius, besides the son of\r\nDomitius, and several other young men, and a great number of Roman\r\nknights and burgesses, whom Domitius had summoned from the municipal\r\ntowns. When they were brought before him he protected them from the\r\ninsolence and taunts of the soldiers; told them in few words that they\r\nhad not made him a grateful return, on their part, for his very\r\nextraordinary kindness to them, and dismissed them all in safety. Sixty\r\nsestertia, which Domitius had brought with him and lodged in the public\r\ntreasury, being brought to Caesar by the magistrates of Corfinium, he\r\ngave them back to Domitius, that he might not appear more moderate with\r\nrespect to the life of men than in money matters, though he knew that it\r\nwas public money, and had been given by Pompey to pay his army. He\r\nordered Domitius's soldiers to take the oath to himself, and that day\r\ndecamped and performed the regular march. He stayed only seven days\r\nbefore Corfinium, and marched into Apulia through the country of the\r\nMarrucinians, Frentanians, and Larinates.\r\n\r\nXXIV.--Pompey, being informed of what had passed at Corfinium, marches\r\nfrom Luceria to Canusium, and thence to Brundusium. He orders all the\r\nforces raised everywhere by the new levies to repair to him. He gives\r\narms to the slaves that attended the flocks, and appoints horses for\r\nthem. Of these he made up about three hundred horse. Lucius, the\r\npraetor, fled from Alba, with six cohorts: Rutilus Lupus, the praetor,\r\nfrom Tarracina, with three. These having descried Caesar's cavalry at a\r\ndistance, which were commanded by Bivius Curius, and having deserted the\r\npraetor, carried their colours to Curius and went over to him. In like\r\nmanner during the rest of his march, several cohorts fell in with the\r\nmain body of Caesar's army, others with his horse. Cneius Magius, from\r\nCremona, engineer-general to Pompey, was taken prisoner on the road and\r\nbrought to Caesar, but sent back by him to Pompey with this message: \"As\r\nhitherto he had not been allowed an interview, and was now on his march\r\nto him at Brundusium, that it deeply concerned the commonwealth and\r\ngeneral safety that he should have an interview with Pompey; and that\r\nthe same advantage could not be gained at a great distance when the\r\nproposals were conveyed to them by others, as if terms were argued by\r\nthem both in person.\"\r\n\r\nXXV.--Having delivered this message he marched to Brundusium with six\r\nlegions, four of them veterans: the rest those which he had raised in\r\nthe late levy and completed on his march, for he had sent all Domitius's\r\ncohorts immediately from Corfinium to Sicily. He discovered that the\r\nconsuls were gone to Dyrrachium with a considerable part of the army,\r\nand that Pompey remained at Brundusium with twenty cohorts; but could\r\nnot find out, for a certainty, whether Pompey stayed behind to keep\r\npossession of Brundusium, that he might the more easily command the\r\nwhole Adriatic sea, with the extremities of Italy and the coast of\r\nGreece, and be able to conduct the war on either side of it, or whether\r\nhe remained there for want of shipping; and, being afraid that Pompey\r\nwould come to the conclusion that he ought not to relinquish Italy, he\r\ndetermined to deprive him of the means of communication afforded by the\r\nharbour of Brundusium. The plan of his work was as follows:--Where the\r\nmouth of the port was narrowest he threw up a mole of earth on either\r\nside, because in these places the sea was shallow. Having gone out so\r\nfar that the mole could not be continued in the deep water, he fixed\r\ndouble floats, thirty feet on either side, before the mole. These he\r\nfastened with four anchors at the four corners, that they might not be\r\ncarried away by the waves. Having completed and secured them, he then\r\njoined to them other floats of equal size. These he covered over with\r\nearth and mould, that he might not be prevented from access to them to\r\ndefend them, and in the front and on both sides he protected them with a\r\nparapet of wicker work; and on every fourth one raised a turret, two\r\nstories high, to secure them the better from being attacked by the\r\nshipping and set on fire.\r\n\r\nXXVI.--To counteract this, Pompey fitted out large merchant ships, which\r\nhe found in the harbour of Brundusium: on them he erected turrets three\r\nstories high, and, having furnished them with several engines and all\r\nsorts of weapons, drove them amongst Caesar's works, to break through\r\nthe floats and interrupt the works; thus there happened skirmishes every\r\nday at a distance with slings, arrows, and other weapons. Caesar\r\nconducted matters as if he thought that the hopes of peace were not yet\r\nto be given up. And though he was very much surprised that Magius, whom\r\nhe had sent to Pompey with a message, was not sent back to him; and\r\nthough his attempting a reconciliation often retarded the vigorous\r\nprosecution of his plans, yet he thought that he ought by all means to\r\npersevere in the same line of conduct. He therefore sent Caninius\r\nRebilus to have an interview with Scribonius Libo, his intimate friend\r\nand relation. He charges him to exhort Libo to effect a peace, but,\r\nabove all things, requires that he should be admitted to an interview\r\nwith Pompey. He declared that he had great hopes, if that were allowed\r\nhim, that the consequence would be that both parties would lay down\r\ntheir arms on equal terms; that a great share of the glory and\r\nreputation of that event would redound to Libo, if, through his advice\r\nand agency, hostilities should be ended. Libo, having parted from the\r\nconference with Caninius, went to Pompey, and, shortly after, returns\r\nwith answer that, as the consuls were absent, no treaty of compositions\r\ncould be engaged in without them. Caesar therefore thought it time at\r\nlength to give over the attempt which he had often made in vain, and act\r\nwith energy in the war.\r\n\r\nXXVII.--When Caesar's works were nearly half finished, and after nine\r\ndays were spent in them, the ships which had conveyed the first division\r\nof the army to Dyrrachium being sent back by the consuls, returned to\r\nBrundusium. Pompey, either frightened at Caesar's works or determined\r\nfrom the beginning to quit Italy, began to prepare for his departure on\r\nthe arrival of the ships; and the more effectually to retard Caesar's\r\nattack, lest his soldiers should force their way into the town at the\r\nmoment of his departure, he stopped up the gates, built walls across the\r\nstreets and avenues, sunk trenches across the ways, and in them fixed\r\npalisadoes and sharp stakes, which he made level with the ground by\r\nmeans of hurdles and clay. But he barricaded with large beams fastened\r\nin the ground and sharpened at the ends two passages and roads without\r\nthe walls, which led to the port. After making these arrangements, he\r\nordered his soldiers to go on board without noise, and disposed here and\r\nthere, on the wall and turrets, some light-armed veterans, archers and\r\nslingers. These he designed to call off by a certain signal, when all\r\nthe soldiers were embarked, and left row-galleys for them in a secure\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nXXVIII.--The people of Brundusium, irritated by the insolence of\r\nPompey's soldiers, and the insults received from Pompey himself, were in\r\nfavour of Caesar's party. Therefore, as soon as they were aware of\r\nPompey's departure, whilst his men were running up and down, and busied\r\nabout their voyage, they made signs from the tops of the houses: Caesar,\r\nbeing apprized of the design by them, ordered scaling ladders to be got\r\nready, and his men to take arms, that he might not lose any opportunity\r\nof coming to an action. Pompey weighed anchor at nightfall. The soldiers\r\nwho had been posted on the wall to guard it, were called off by the\r\nsignal which had been agreed on, and knowing the roads, ran down to the\r\nships. Caesar's soldiers fixed their ladders and scaled the walls: but\r\nbeing cautioned by the people to beware of the hidden stakes and covered\r\ntrenches, they halted, and being conducted by the inhabitants by a long\r\ncircuit, they reached the port, and captured with their long boats and\r\nsmall craft two of Pompey's ships, full of soldiers, which had struck\r\nagainst Caesar's moles.\r\n\r\nXXIX.-Though Caesar highly approved of collecting a fleet, and crossing\r\nthe sea, and pursuing Pompey before he could strengthen himself with his\r\ntransmarine auxiliaries, with the hope of bringing the war to a\r\nconclusion, yet he dreaded the delay and length of time necessary to\r\neffect it: because Pompey, by collecting all his ships, had deprived him\r\nof the means of pursuing him at present. The only resource left to\r\nCaesar, was to wait for a fleet from the distant regions of Gaul,\r\nPicenum, and the straits of Gibraltar. But this, on account of the\r\nseason of the year, appeared tedious and troublesome. He was unwilling\r\nthat, in the meantime, the veteran army, and the two Spains, one of\r\nwhich was bound to Pompey by the strongest obligations, should be\r\nconfirmed in his interest; that auxiliaries and cavalry should be\r\nprovided and Gaul and Italy reduced in his absence.\r\n\r\nXXX.--Therefore, for the present, he relinquished all intention of\r\npursuing Pompey, and resolved to march to Spain, and commanded the\r\nmagistrates of the free towns to procure him ships, and to have them\r\nconveyed to Brundusium. He detached Valerius, his lieutenant, with one\r\nlegion to Sardinia; Curio, the proprietor, to Sicily with three legions;\r\nand ordered him, when he had recovered Sicily, to immediately transport\r\nhis army to Africa. Marcus Cotta was at this time governor of Sardinia:\r\nMarcus Cato, of Sicily: and Tubero, by the lots, should have had the\r\ngovernment of Africa. The Caralitani, as soon as they heard that\r\nValerius was sent against them, even before he left Italy, of their own\r\naccord drove Cotta out of the town; who, terrified because he understood\r\nthat the whole province was combined [against him], fled from Sardinia\r\nto Africa. Cato was in Sicily, repairing the old ships of war, and\r\ndemanding new ones from the states, and these things he performed with\r\ngreat zeal. He was raising levies of Roman citizens, among the Lucani\r\nand Brutii, by his lieutenants, and exacting a certain quota of horse\r\nand foot from the states of Sicily. When these things were nearly\r\ncompleted, being informed of Curio's approach, he made a complaint that\r\nhe was abandoned and betrayed by Pompey, who had undertaken an\r\nunnecessary war, without making any preparation, and when questioned by\r\nhim and other members in the senate, had assured them that every thing\r\nwas ready and provided for the war. After having made these complaints\r\nin a public assembly, he fled from his province.\r\n\r\nXXXI.--Valerius found Sardinia, and Curio, Sicily, deserted by their\r\ngovernors when they arrived there with their armies. When Tubero arrived\r\nin Africa, he found Attius Varus in the government of the province, who,\r\nhaving lost his cohorts, as already related, at Auximum, had straightway\r\nfled to Africa, and finding it without a governor, had seized it of his\r\nown accord, and making levies, had raised two legions. From his\r\nacquaintance with the people and country, and his knowledge of that\r\nprovince, he found the means of effecting this; because a few years\r\nbefore, at the expiration of his praetorship, he had obtained that\r\nprovince. He, when Tubero came to Utica with his fleet, prevented his\r\nentering the port or town, and did not suffer his son, though labouring\r\nunder sickness, to set foot on shore; but obliged him to weigh anchor\r\nand quit the place.\r\n\r\nXXXIL.--When these affairs were despatched, Caesar, that there might be\r\nan intermission from labour for the rest of the season, drew off his\r\nsoldiers to the nearest municipal towns, and set off in person for Rome.\r\nHaving assembled the senate, he reminded them of the injustice of his\r\nenemies; and told them, \"That he aimed at no extraordinary honour, but\r\nhad waited for the time appointed by law, for standing candidate for the\r\nconsulate, being contented with what was allowed to every citizen. That\r\na bill had been carried by the ten tribunes of the people\r\n(notwithstanding the resistance of his enemies, and a very violent\r\nopposition from Cato, who in his usual manner, consumed the day by a\r\ntedious harangue) that he should be allowed to stand candidate, though\r\nabsent, even in the consulship of Pompey; and if the latter disapproved\r\nof the bill, why did he allow it to pass? if he approved of it, why\r\nshould he debar him [Caesar] from the people's favour? He made mention\r\nof his own patience, in that he had freely proposed that all armies\r\nshould be disbanded, by which he himself would suffer the loss both of\r\ndignity and honour. He urged the virulence of his enemies, who refused\r\nto comply with what they required from others, and had rather that all\r\nthings should be thrown into confusion, than that they should lose their\r\npower and their armies. He expatiated on their injustice, in taking away\r\nhis legions: their cruelty and insolence in abridging the privileges of\r\nthe tribunes; the proposals he had made, and his entreaties of an\r\ninterview, which had been refused him: For which reasons, he begged and\r\ndesired that they would undertake the management of the republic, and\r\nunite with him in the administration of it. But if through fear they\r\ndeclined it, he would not be a burden to them, but take the management\r\nof it on himself. That deputies ought to be sent to Pompey, to propose a\r\nreconciliation; as he did not regard what Pompey had lately asserted in\r\nthe senate, that authority was acknowledged to be vested in those\r\npersons to whom ambassadors were sent, and fear implied in those that\r\nsent them. That these were the sentiments of low, weak minds: that for\r\nhis part, as he had made it his study to surpass others in glory, so he\r\nwas desirous of excelling them in justice and equity.\"\r\n\r\nXXXIII.--The senate approved of sending deputies, but none could be\r\nfound fit to execute the commission: for every person, from his own\r\nprivate fears, declined the office. For Pompey, on leaving the city, had\r\ndeclared in the open senate, that he would hold in the same degree of\r\nestimation, those who stayed in Rome and those in Caesar's camp. Thus\r\nthree days were wasted in disputes and excuses. Besides, Lucius\r\nMetellus, one of the tribunes, was suborned by Caesar's enemies, to\r\nprevent this, and to embarrass everything else which Caesar should\r\npropose. Caesar having discovered his intention, after spending several\r\ndays to no purpose, left the city, in order that he might not lose any\r\nmore time, and went to Transalpine Gaul, without effecting what he had\r\nintended.\r\n\r\nXXXIV.--On his arrival there, he was informed that, Vibullius Rufus,\r\nwhom he had taken a few days before at Corfinium, and set at liberty,\r\nwas sent by Pompey into Spain; and that Domitius also was gone to seize\r\nMassilia with seven row-galleys, which were fitted up by some private\r\npersons at Igilium and Cosa, and which he had manned with his own\r\nslaves, freedmen, and colonists: and that some young noblemen of\r\nMassilia had been sent before him; whom Pompey, when leaving Rome had\r\nexhorted, that the late services of Caesar should not erase from their\r\nminds the memory of his former favours. On receiving this message, the\r\nMassilians had shut their gates against Caesar, and invited over to them\r\nthe Albici, who had formerly been in alliance with them, and who\r\ninhabited the mountains that overhung Massilia: they had likewise\r\nconveyed the corn from the surrounding country, and from all the forts\r\ninto the city; had opened armouries in the city: and were repairing the\r\nwalls, the fleet, and the gates.\r\n\r\nXXXV.--Caesar sent for fifteen of the principal persons of Massilia to\r\nattend him. To prevent the war commencing among them, he remonstrates\r\n[in the following language]; \"that they ought to follow the precedent\r\nset by all Italy, rather than submit to the will of any one man.\" He\r\nmade use of such arguments as he thought would tend to bring them to\r\nreason. The deputies reported his speech to their countrymen, and by the\r\nauthority of the state bring him back this answer: \"That they understood\r\nthat the Roman people was divided into two factions: that they had\r\nneither judgment nor abilities to decide which had the juster cause; but\r\nthat the heads of these factions were Cneius Pompey and Caius Caesar,\r\nthe two patrons of the state: the former of whom had granted to their\r\nstate the lands of the Volcae Arecomici, and Helvii; the latter had\r\nassigned them a part of his conquests in Gaul, and had augmented their\r\nrevenue. Wherefore, having received equal favours from both, they ought\r\nto show equal affection to both, and assist neither against the other,\r\nnor admit either into their city or harbours.\"\r\n\r\nXXXVI.--Whilst this treaty was going forward, Domitius arrived at\r\nMassilia with his fleet, and was received into the city, and made\r\ngovernor of it. The chief management of the war was entrusted to him. At\r\nhis command they send the fleet to all parts; they seize all the\r\nmerchantmen they could meet with, and carry them into the harbour; they\r\napply the nails, timber, and rigging, with which they were furnished to\r\nrig and refit their other vessels. They lay up in the public stores, all\r\nthe corn that was found in the ships, and reserve the rest of their\r\nlading and convoy for the siege of the town, should such an event take\r\nplace. Provoked at such ill treatment, Caesar led three legions against\r\nMassilia, and resolved to provide turrets, and vinae to assault the\r\ntown, and to build twelve ships at Arelas, which being completed and\r\nrigged in thirty days (from the time the timber was cut down), and being\r\nbrought to Massilia, he put under the command of Decimus Brutus; and\r\nleft Caius Trebonius his lieutenant, to invest the city.\r\n\r\nXXXVII.--Whilst he was preparing and getting these things in readiness,\r\nhe sent Caius Fabius one of his lieutenants into Spain with three\r\nlegions, which he had disposed in winter quarters in Narbo, and the\r\nneighbouring country; and ordered him immediately to seize the passes of\r\nthe Pyrenees, which were at that time occupied by detachments from\r\nLucius Afranius, one of Pompey's lieutenants. He desired the other\r\nlegions, which were passing the winter at a great distance, to follow\r\nclose after him. Fabius, according to his orders, by using expedition,\r\ndislodged the party from the hills, and by hasty marches came up with\r\nthe army of Afranius.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII.--On the arrival of Vibullius Rufus, whom, we have already\r\nmentioned, Pompey had sent into Spain, Afranius, Petreius, and Varro,\r\nhis lieutenants (one of whom had the command of Hither Spain, with three\r\nlegions; the second of the country from the forest of Castulo to the\r\nriver Guadiana with two legions; the third from the river Guadiana to\r\nthe country of the Vettones and Lusitania, with the like number of\r\nlegions), divided amongst themselves their respective departments.\r\nPetreius was to march from Lusitania through the Vettones, and join\r\nAfranius with all his forces; Varro was to guard all Further Spain with\r\nwhat legions he had. These matters being settled, reinforcements of\r\nhorse and foot were demanded from Lusitania, by Petreius; from the\r\nCeltiberi, Cantabri, and all the barbarous nations which border on the\r\nocean, by Afranius. When they were raised, Petreius immediately marched\r\nthrough the Vettones to Afranius. They resolved by joint consent to\r\ncarry on the war in the vicinity of Ilerda, on account of the advantages\r\nof its situation.\r\n\r\nXXXIX.--Afranius, as above mentioned, had three legions, Petreius two.\r\nThere were besides about eighty cohorts raised in Hither and Further\r\nSpain (of which, the troops belonging to the former province had\r\nshields, those of the latter targets), and about five thousand horse\r\nraised in both provinces. Caesar had sent his legions into Spain, with\r\nabout six thousand auxiliary foot, and three thousand horse, which had\r\nserved under him in all his former wars, and the same number from Gaul,\r\nwhich he himself had provided, having expressly called out all the most\r\nnoble and valiant men of each state. The bravest of these were from the\r\nAquitani and the mountaineers, who border on the Province in Gaul. He\r\nhad been informed that Pompey was marching through Mauritania with his\r\nlegions to Spain, and would shortly arrive. He at the same time borrowed\r\nmoney from the tribunes and centurions, which he distributed amongst his\r\nsoldiers. By this proceeding he gained two points; he secured the\r\ninterest of the centurions by this pledge in his hands, and by his\r\nliberality he purchased the affections of his army.\r\n\r\nXL.--Fabius sounded the inclinations of the neighbouring states by\r\nletters and messengers. He had made two bridges over the river Segre, at\r\nthe distance of four miles from each other. He sent foraging parties\r\nover these bridges, because he had already consumed all the forage that\r\nwas on his side of the river. The generals of Pompey's army did almost\r\nthe same thing, and for the same reason: and the horse had frequent\r\nskirmishes with each other. When two of Fabius's legions had, as was\r\ntheir constant practice, gone forth as the usual protection to the\r\nforagers, and had crossed the river, and the baggage, and all the horse\r\nwere following them, on a sudden, from the weight of the cattle, and the\r\nmass of water, the bridge fell, and all the horse were cut off from the\r\nmain army, which being known to Petreius and Afranius, from the timber\r\nand hurdles that were carried down the river, Afranius immediately\r\ncrossed his own bridge, which communicated between his camp and the\r\ntown, with four legions and all the cavalry, and marched against\r\nFabius's two legions. When his approach was announced, Lucius Plancus,\r\nwho had the command of those legions, compelled by the emergency, took\r\npost on a rising ground; and drew up his army with two fronts, that it\r\nmight not be surrounded by the cavalry. Thus, though engaged with\r\nsuperior numbers, he sustained the furious charge of the legions and the\r\nhorse. When the battle was begun by the horse, there were observed at a\r\ndistance by both sides the colours of two legions, which Caius Fabius\r\nhad sent round by the further bridge to reinforce our men, suspecting,\r\nas the event verified, that the enemy's generals would take advantage of\r\nthe opportunity which fortune had put in their way, to attack our men.\r\nTheir approach put an end to the battle, and each general led back his\r\nlegions to their respective camps.\r\n\r\nXLI.--In two days after Caesar came to the camp with nine hundred horse,\r\nwhich he had retained for a bodyguard. The bridge which had been broken\r\ndown by the storm was almost repaired, and he ordered it to be finished\r\nin the night. Being acquainted with the nature of the country, he left\r\nbehind him six cohorts to guard the bridge, the camp, and all his\r\nbaggage, and the next day set off in person for Ilerda, with all his\r\nforces drawn up in three lines, and halted just before the camp of\r\nAfranius, and having remained there a short time under arms, he offered\r\nhim battle on equal terms. When this offer was made, Afranius drew out\r\nhis forces, and posted them on the middle of a hill, near his camp. When\r\nCaesar perceived that Afranius declined coming to an engagement, he\r\nresolved to encamp at somewhat less than half a mile's distance from the\r\nvery foot of the mountain; and that his soldiers whilst engaged in their\r\nworks, might not be terrified by any sudden attack of the enemy, or\r\ndisturbed in their work, he ordered them not to fortify it with a wall,\r\nwhich must rise high, and be seen at a distance, but draw, on the front\r\nopposite the enemy, a trench fifteen feet broad. The first and second\r\nlines continued under arms as was from the first appointed. Behind them\r\nthe third line was carrying on the work without being seen; so that the\r\nwhole was completed before Afranius discovered that the camp was being\r\nfortified.\r\n\r\nXLII.--In the evening Caesar drew his legions within this trench, and\r\nrested them under arms the next night. The day following he kept his\r\nwhole army within it, and as it was necessary to bring materials from a\r\nconsiderable distance, he for the present pursued the same plan in his\r\nwork; and to each legion, one after the other, he assigned one side of\r\nthe camp to fortify, and ordered trenches of the same magnitude to be\r\ncut: he kept the rest of the legions under arms without baggage to\r\noppose the enemy. Afranius and Petreius, to frighten us and obstruct the\r\nwork, drew out their forces at the very foot of the mountain, and\r\nchallenged us to battle. Caesar, however, did not interrupt his work,\r\nrelying on the protection of the three legions, and the strength of the\r\nfosse. After staying for a short time, and advancing no great distance\r\nfrom the bottom of the hill, they led back their forces to their camp.\r\nThe third day Caesar fortified his camp with a rampart, and ordered the\r\nother cohorts which he had left in the upper camp, and his baggage to be\r\nremoved to it.\r\n\r\nXLIIL-Between the town of Ilerda and the next hill, on which Afranius\r\nand Petreius were encamped, there was a plain about three hundred paces\r\nbroad, and near the middle of it an eminence somewhat raised above the\r\nlevel: Caesar hoped that if he could get possession of this and fortify\r\nit, he should be able to cut off the enemy from the town, the bridge,\r\nand all the stores which they had laid up in the town. In expectation of\r\nthis he led three legions out of the camp, and, drawing up his army in\r\nan advantageous position, he ordered the advanced men of one legion to\r\nhasten forward and seize the eminence. Upon intelligence of this the\r\ncohorts which were on guard before Afranius's camp were instantly sent a\r\nnearer way to occupy the same post. The two parties engage, and as\r\nAfranius's men had reached the eminence first, our men were repulsed,\r\nand, on a reinforcement being sent, they were obliged to turn their\r\nbacks and retreat to the standards of legions.\r\n\r\nXLIV.--The manner of fighting of those soldiers was to run forward with\r\ngreat impetuosity and boldly take a post, and not to keep their ranks\r\nstrictly, but to fight in small scattered parties: if hard pressed they\r\nthought it no disgrace to retire and give up the post, being accustomed\r\nto this manner of fighting among the Lusitanians and other barbarous\r\nnations; for it commonly happens that soldiers are strongly influenced\r\nby the customs of those countries in which they have spent much time.\r\nThis method, however, alarmed our men, who were not used to such a\r\ndescription of warfare. For they imagined that they were about to be\r\nsurrounded on their exposed flank by the single men who ran forward from\r\ntheir ranks; and they thought it their duty to keep their ranks, and not\r\nto quit their colours, nor, without good reason, to give up the post\r\nwhich they had taken. Accordingly, when the advanced guard gave way, the\r\nlegion which was stationed on that wing did not keep its ground, but\r\nretreated to the next hill.\r\n\r\nXLV.--Almost the whole army being daunted at this, because it had\r\noccurred contrary to their expectations and custom, Caesar encouraged\r\nhis men and led the ninth legion to their relief, and checked the\r\ninsolent and eager pursuit of the enemy, and obliged them, in their\r\nturn, to show their backs and retreat to Ilerda, and take post under the\r\nwalls. But the soldiers of the ninth legion, being over zealous to\r\nrepair the dishonour which had been sustained, having rashly pursued the\r\nfleeing enemy, advanced into disadvantageous ground and went up to the\r\nfoot of the mountain on which the town Ilerda was built. And when they\r\nwished to retire they were again attacked by the enemy from the rising\r\nground. The place was craggy in the front and steep on either side, and\r\nwas so narrow that even three cohorts, drawn up in order of battle,\r\nwould fill it; but no relief could be sent on the flanks, and the horse\r\ncould be of no service to them when hard pressed. From the town, indeed,\r\nthe precipice inclined with a gentle slope for near four hundred paces.\r\nOur men had to retreat this way, as they had, through their eagerness,\r\nadvanced too inconsiderately. The greatest contest was in this place,\r\nwhich was much to the disadvantage of our troops, both on account of its\r\nnarrowness, and because they were posted at the foot of the mountain, so\r\nthat no weapon was thrown at them without effect: yet they exerted their\r\nvalour and patience, and bore every wound. The enemy's forces were\r\nincreasing, and cohorts were frequently sent to their aid from the camp\r\nthrough the town, that fresh men might relieve the weary. Caesar was\r\nobliged to do the same, and relieve the fatigued by sending cohorts to\r\nthat post.\r\n\r\nXLVI.--After the battle had in this manner continued incessantly for\r\nfive hours, and our men had suffered much from superior numbers, having\r\nspent all their javelins, they drew their swords and charged the enemy\r\nup the hill, and, having killed a few, obliged the rest to fly. The\r\ncohorts being beaten back to the wall, and some being driven by their\r\nfears into the town, an easy retreat was afforded to our men. Our\r\ncavalry also, on either flank, though stationed on sloping or low\r\nground, yet bravely struggled up to the top of the hill, and, riding\r\nbetween the two armies, made our retreat more easy and secure. Such were\r\nthe various turns of fortune in the battle. In the first encounter about\r\nseventy of our men fell: amongst them Quintus Fulgenius, first centurion\r\nof the second line of the fourteenth legion, who, for his extraordinary\r\nvalour, had been promoted from the lower ranks to that post. About six\r\nhundred were wounded. Of Afranius's party there were killed Titus\r\nCaecilius, principal centurion, and four other centurions, and above two\r\nhundred men.\r\n\r\nXLVII.--But this opinion is spread abroad concerning this day, that each\r\nparty thought that they came off conquerors. Afranius's soldiers,\r\nbecause, though they were esteemed inferior in the opinion of all, yet\r\nthey had stood our attack and sustained our charge, and, at first, had\r\nkept the post and the hill which had been the occasion of the dispute;\r\nand, in the first encounter, had obliged our men to fly: but ours,\r\nbecause, notwithstanding the disadvantage of the ground and the\r\ndisparity of numbers, they had maintained the battle for five hours, had\r\nadvanced up the hill sword in hand, and had forced the enemy to fly from\r\nthe higher ground and driven them into the town. The enemy fortified the\r\nhill, about which the contest had been, with strong works, and posted a\r\ngarrison on it.\r\n\r\nXLVIII.--In two days after this transaction, there happened an\r\nunexpected misfortune. For so great a storm arose, that it was agreed\r\nthat there were never seen higher floods in those countries; it swept\r\ndown the snow from all the mountains, and broke over the banks of the\r\nriver, and in one day carried away both the bridges which Fabius had\r\nbuilt,--a circumstance which caused great difficulties to Caesar's army.\r\nFor as our camp, as already mentioned, was pitched between two rivers,\r\nthe Segre and Cinca, and as neither of these could be forded for the\r\nspace of thirty miles, they were all of necessity confined within these\r\nnarrow limits. Neither could the states, which had espoused Caesar's\r\ncause, furnish him with corn, nor the troops, which had gone far to\r\nforage, return, as they were stopped by the waters: nor could the\r\nconvoys, coming from Italy and Gaul, make their way to the camp.\r\nBesides, it was the most distressing season of the year, when there was\r\nno corn in the blade, and it was nearly ripe: and the states were\r\nexhausted, because Afranius had conveyed almost all the corn, before\r\nCaesar's arrival, into Ilerda, and whatever he had left, had been\r\nalready consumed by Caesar. The cattle, which might have served as a\r\nsecondary resource against want, had been removed by the states to a\r\ngreat distance on account of the war. They who had gone out to get\r\nforage or corn, were chased by the light troops of the Lusitanians, and\r\nthe targeteers of Hither Spain, who were well acquainted with the\r\ncountry, and could readily swim across the river, because it is the\r\ncustom of all those people not to join their armies without bladders.\r\n\r\nXLIX.--But Afranius's army had abundance of everything; a great stock of\r\ncorn had been provided and laid in long before, a large quantity was\r\ncoming in from the whole province: they had a good store of forage. The\r\nbridge of Ilerda afforded an opportunity of getting all these without\r\nany danger, and the places beyond the bridge, to which Caesar had no\r\naccess, were as yet untouched.\r\n\r\nL.--Those floods continued several days. Caesar endeavoured to repair\r\nthe bridges, but the height of the water did not allow him: and the\r\ncohorts disposed along the banks did not suffer them to be completed;\r\nand it was easy for them to prevent it, both from the nature of the\r\nriver and the height of the water, but especially because their darts\r\nwere thrown from the whole course of the bank on one confined spot; and\r\nit was no easy matter at one and the same time to execute a work in a\r\nvery rapid flood, and to avoid the darts.\r\n\r\nLI.--Intelligence was brought to Afranius that the great convoys, which\r\nwere on their march to Caesar, had halted at the river. Archers from the\r\nRutheni, and horse from the Gauls, with a long train of baggage,\r\naccording to the Gallic custom of travelling, had arrived there; there\r\nwere besides about six thousand people of all descriptions, with slaves\r\nand freed men. But there was no order, or regular discipline, as every\r\none followed his own humour, and all travelled without apprehension,\r\ntaking the same liberty as on former marches. There were several young\r\nnoblemen, sons of senators, and of equestrian rank; there were\r\nambassadors from several states; there were lieutenants of Caesar's. The\r\nriver stopped them all. To attack them by surprise, Afranius set out in\r\nthe beginning of the night, with all his cavalry and three legions, and\r\nsent the horse on before, to fall on them unawares; but the Gallic horse\r\nsoon got themselves in readiness, and attacked them. Though but few,\r\nthey withstood the vast number of the enemy, as long as they fought on\r\nequal terms: but when the legions began to approach, having lost a few\r\nmen, they retreated to the next mountains. The delay occasioned by this\r\nbattle was of great importance to the security of our men; for having\r\ngained time, they retired to the higher grounds. There were missing that\r\nday about two hundred bow-men, a few horse, and an inconsiderable number\r\nof servants and baggage.\r\n\r\nLII.--However, by all these things, the price of provisions was raised,\r\nwhich is commonly a disaster attendant, not only on a time of present\r\nscarcity, but on the apprehension of future want. Provisions had now\r\nreached fifty denarii each bushel; and the want of corn had diminished\r\nthe strength of the soldiers; and the inconveniences were increasing\r\nevery day: and so great an alteration was wrought in a few days, and\r\nfortune had so changed sides, that our men had to struggle with the want\r\nof every necessary; while the enemy had an abundant supply of all\r\nthings, and were considered to have the advantage. Caesar demanded from\r\nthose states which had acceded to his alliance, a supply of cattle, as\r\nthey had but little corn. He sent away the camp followers to the more\r\ndistant states, and endeavoured to remedy the present scarcity by every\r\nresource in his power.\r\n\r\nLIII.--Afranius and Petreius, and their friends, sent fuller and more\r\ncircumstantial accounts of these things to Rome, to their acquaintances.\r\nReport exaggerated them so that the war appeared to be almost at an end.\r\nWhen these letters and despatches were received at Rome, a great\r\nconcourse of people resorted to the house of Afranius, and\r\ncongratulations ran high: several went out of Italy to Cneius Pompey;\r\nsome of them, to be the first to bring him the intelligence; others,\r\nthat they might not be thought to have waited the issue of the war, and\r\nto have come last of all.\r\n\r\nLIV.--When Caesar's affairs were in this unfavourable position, and all\r\nthe passes were guarded by the soldiers and horse of Afranius, and the\r\nbridges could not be prepared, Caesar ordered his soldiers to make ships\r\nof the kind that his knowledge of Britain a few years before had taught\r\nhim. First, the keels and ribs were made of light timber, then, the rest\r\nof the hulk of the ships was wrought with wicker-work, and covered over\r\nwith hides. When these were finished, he drew them down to the river in\r\nwaggons in one night, a distance of twenty-two miles from his camp, and\r\ntransported in them some soldiers across the river, and on a sudden took\r\npossession of a hill adjoining the bank. This he immediately fortified,\r\nbefore he was perceived by the enemy. To this he afterwards transported\r\na legion: and having begun a bridge on both sides, he finished it in two\r\ndays. By this means, he brought safe to his camp the convoys, and those\r\nwho had gone out to forage; and began to prepare a conveyance for the\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\nLV.--The same day he made a great part of his horse pass the river, who,\r\nfalling on the foragers by surprise as they were dispersed without any\r\nsuspicions, intercepted an incredible number of cattle and people; and\r\nwhen some Spanish light-armed cohorts were sent to reinforce the enemy,\r\nour men judiciously divided themselves into two parts, the one to\r\nprotect the spoil, the other to resist the advancing foe, and to beat\r\nthem back, and they cut off from the rest and surrounded one cohort,\r\nwhich had rashly ventured out of the line before the others, and after\r\nputting it to the sword, returned safe with considerable booty to the\r\ncamp over the same bridge.\r\n\r\nLVI.--Whilst these affairs are going forward at Ilerda, the Massilians,\r\nadopting the advice of Domitius, prepared seventeen ships of war, of\r\nwhich eleven were decked. To these they add several smaller vessels,\r\nthat our fleet might be terrified by numbers: they man them with a great\r\nnumber of archers and of the Albici, of whom mention has been already\r\nmade, and these they incited by rewards and promises. Domitius required\r\ncertain ships for his own use, which he manned with colonists and\r\nshepherds, whom he had brought along with him. A fleet being thus\r\nfurnished with every necessary, he advanced with great confidence\r\nagainst our ships, commanded by Decimus Brutus. It was stationed at an\r\nisland opposite to Massilia.\r\n\r\nLVII.--Brutus was much inferior in number of ships; but Caesar had\r\nappointed to that fleet the bravest men selected from all his legions,\r\nantesignani and centurions, who had requested to be employed in that\r\nservice. They had provided iron hooks and harpoons, and had furnished\r\nthemselves with a vast number of javelins, darts, and missiles. Thus\r\nprepared, and being apprised of the enemy's approach, they put out from\r\nthe harbour, and engaged the Massilians. Both sides fought with great\r\ncourage and resolution; nor did the Albici, a hardy people, bred on the\r\nhighlands and inured to arms, fall much short of our men in valour: and\r\nbeing lately come from the Massilians, they retained in their minds\r\ntheir recent promises: and the wild shepherds, encouraged by the hope of\r\nliberty, were eager to prove their zeal in the presence of their\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\nLVIII.--The Massilians themselves, confiding in the quickness of their\r\nships, and the skill of their pilots, eluded ours, and evaded the shock,\r\nand as long as they were permitted by clear space, lengthening their\r\nline they endeavoured to surround us, or to attack single ships with\r\nseveral of theirs, or to run across our ships, and carry away our oars,\r\nif possible; but when necessity obliged them to come nearer, they had\r\nrecourse, from the skill and art of the pilots, to the valour of the\r\nmountaineers. But our men, not having such expert seamen, or skilful\r\npilots, for they had been hastily drafted from the merchant ships, and\r\nwere not yet acquainted even with the names of the rigging, were\r\nmoreover impeded by the heaviness and slowness of our vessels, which\r\nhaving been built in a hurry and of green timber, were not so easily\r\nmanoeuvred. Therefore, when Caesar's men had an opportunity of a close\r\nengagement, they cheerfully opposed two of the enemy's ships with one of\r\ntheirs. And throwing in the grappling irons, and holding both ships\r\nfast, they fought on both sides of the deck, and boarded the enemy's;\r\nand having killed numbers of the Albici and shepherds, they sank some of\r\ntheir ships, took others with the men on board, and drove the rest into\r\nthe harbour. That day the Massilians lost nine ships, including those\r\nthat were taken.\r\n\r\nLIX.--When news of this battle was brought to Caesar at Ilerda, the\r\nbridge being completed at the same time, fortune soon took a turn. The\r\nenemy, daunted by the courage of our horse, did not scour the country as\r\nfreely or as boldly as before: but sometimes advancing a small distance\r\nfrom the camp, that they might have a ready retreat, they foraged within\r\nnarrower bounds: at other times, they took a longer circuit to avoid our\r\noutposts and parties of horse; or having sustained some loss, or\r\ndescried our horse at a distance, they fled in the midst of their\r\nexpedition, leaving their baggage behind them; at length they resolved\r\nto leave off foraging for several days, and, contrary to the practice of\r\nall nations, to go out at night.\r\n\r\nLX.--In the meantime the Oscenses and the Calagurritani, who were under\r\nthe government of the Oscenses, send ambassadors to Caesar, and offer to\r\nsubmit to his orders. They are followed by the Tarraconenses, Jacetani,\r\nand Ausetani, and in a few days more by the Illurgavonenses, who dwell\r\nnear the river Ebro. He requires of them all to assist him with corn, to\r\nwhich they agreed, and having collected all the cattle in the country,\r\nthey convey them into his camp. One entire cohort of the\r\nIllurgavonenses, knowing the design of their state, came over to Caesar,\r\nfrom the place where they were stationed, and carried their colours with\r\nthem. A great change is shortly made in the face of affairs. The bridge\r\nbeing finished, five powerful states being joined to Caesar, a way\r\nopened for the receiving of corn, and the rumours of the assistance of\r\nlegions which were said to be on their march, with Pompey at their head,\r\nthrough Mauritania, having died away, several of the more distant states\r\nrevolt from Afranius, and enter into league with Caesar.\r\n\r\nLXI.--Whilst the spirits of the enemy were dismayed at these things,\r\nCaesar, that he might not be always obliged to send his horse a long\r\ncircuit round by the bridge, having found a convenient place, began to\r\nsink several drains, thirty feet deep, by which he might draw off a part\r\nof the river Segre, and make a ford over it. When these were almost\r\nfinished, Afranius and Petreius began to be greatly alarmed, lest they\r\nshould be altogether cut off from corn and forage, because Caesar was\r\nvery strong in cavalry. They therefore resolved to quit their posts, and\r\nto transfer the war to Celtiberia. There was, moreover, a circumstance\r\nthat confirmed them in this resolution: for of the two adverse parties,\r\nthat which had stood by Sertorius in the late war, being conquered by\r\nPompey, still trembled at his name and sway, though absent: the other\r\nwhich had remained firm in Pompey's interest, loved him for the favours\r\nwhich they had received: but Caesar's name was not known to the\r\nbarbarians. From these they expected considerable aid, both of horse and\r\nfoot, and hoped to protract the war till winter, in a friendly country.\r\nHaving come to this resolution, they gave orders to collect all the\r\nships in the river Ebro, and to bring them to Octogesa, a town situated\r\non the river Ebro, about twenty miles distant from their camp. At this\r\npart of the river, they ordered a bridge to be made of boats fastened\r\ntogether, and transported two legions over the river Segre, and\r\nfortified their camp with a rampart, twelve feet high.\r\n\r\nLXII.--Notice of this being given by the scouts, Caesar continued his\r\nwork day and night, with very great fatigue to the soldiers, to drain\r\nthe river, and so far effected his purpose, that the horse were both\r\nable and bold enough, though with some difficulty and danger, to pass\r\nthe river; but the foot had only their shoulders and upper part of their\r\nbreast above the water, so that their fording it was retarded, not only\r\nby the depth of the water, but also by the rapidity of the current.\r\nHowever, almost at the same instant, news was received of the bridge\r\nbeing nearly completed over the Ebro, and a ford was found in the Segre.\r\n\r\nLXIII.--Now indeed the enemy began to think that they ought to hasten\r\ntheir march. Accordingly, leaving two auxiliary cohorts in the garrison\r\nat Ilerda, they crossed the Segre with their whole force, and formed one\r\ncamp with the two legions which they had led across a few days before.\r\nCaesar had no resource, but to annoy and cut down their rear; since with\r\nhis cavalry to go by the bridge, required him to take a long circuit; so\r\nthat they would arrive at the Ebro by a much shorter route. The horse,\r\nwhich he had detached, crossed the ford, and when Afranius and Petreius\r\nhad broken up their camp about the third watch, they suddenly appeared\r\non their rear, and spreading round them in great numbers, began to\r\nretard and impede their march.\r\n\r\nLXIV.--At break of day, it was perceived from the rising grounds which\r\njoined Caesar's camp, that their rear was vigorously pressed by our\r\nhorse; that the last line sometimes halted and was broken; at other\r\ntimes, that they joined battle and that our men were beaten back by a\r\ngeneral charge of their cohorts, and, in their turn, pursued them when\r\nthey wheeled about: but through the whole camp the soldiers gathered in\r\nparties, and declared their chagrin that the enemy had been suffered to\r\nescape from their hands and that the war had been unnecessarily\r\nprotracted. They applied to their tribunes and centurions, and entreated\r\nthem to inform Caesar that he need not spare their labour or consider\r\ntheir danger; that they were ready and able, and would venture to ford\r\nthe river where the horse had crossed. Caesar, encouraged by their zeal\r\nand importunity, though he felt reluctant to expose his army to a river\r\nso exceedingly large, yet judged it prudent to attempt it and make a\r\ntrial. Accordingly, he ordered all the weaker soldiers, whose spirit or\r\nstrength seemed unequal to the fatigue, to be selected from each\r\ncentury, and left them, with one legion besides, to guard the camp: the\r\nrest of the legions he drew out without any baggage, and, having\r\ndisposed a great number of horses in the river, above and below the\r\nford, he led his army over. A few of his soldiers being carried away by\r\nthe force of the current, were stopped by the horse and taken up, and\r\nnot a man perished. His army being safe on the opposite bank, he drew\r\nout his forces and resolved to lead them forward in three battalions:\r\nand so great was the ardour of the soldiers that, notwithstanding the\r\naddition of a circuit of six miles and a considerable delay in fording\r\nthe river, before the ninth hour of the day they came up with those who\r\nhad set out at the third watch.\r\n\r\nLXV.--When Afranius, who was in company with Petreius, saw them at a\r\ndistance, being affrighted at so unexpected a sight, he halted on a\r\nrising ground and drew up his army. Caesar refreshed his army on the\r\nplain that he might not expose them to battle whilst fatigued; and when\r\nthe enemy attempted to renew their march, he pursued and stopped them.\r\nThey were obliged to pitch their camp sooner than they had intended, for\r\nthere were mountains at a small distance; and difficult and narrow roads\r\nawaited them about five miles off. They retired behind these mountains\r\nthat they might avoid Caesar's cavalry, and, placing parties in the\r\nnarrow roads, stop the progress of his army and lead their own forces\r\nacross the Ebro without danger or apprehension. This it was their\r\ninterest to attempt and to effect by any means possible; but, fatigued\r\nby the skirmishes all day, and by the labour of their march, they\r\ndeferred it till the following day: Caesar likewise encamped on the next\r\nhill.\r\n\r\nLXVI.--About midnight a few of their men who had gone some distance from\r\nthe camp to fetch water, being taken by our horse, Caesar is informed by\r\nthem that the generals of the enemy were drawing their troops out of the\r\ncamp without noise. Upon this information Caesar ordered the signal to\r\nbe given and the military shout to be raised for packing up the baggage.\r\nWhen they heard the shout, being afraid lest they should be stopped in\r\nthe night and obliged to engage under their baggage, or lest they should\r\nbe confined in the narrow roads by Caesar's horse, they put a stop to\r\ntheir march and kept their forces in their camp. The next day Petreius\r\nwent out privately with a few horse to reconnoitre the country. A\r\nsimilar movement was made from Caesar's camp. Lucius Decidius Saxa was\r\ndetached with a small party to explore the nature of the country. Each\r\nreturned with the same account to his camp, that there was a level road\r\nfor the next five miles, that there then succeeded a rough and\r\nmountainous country. Whichever should first obtain possession of the\r\ndefiles would have no trouble in preventing the other's progress.\r\n\r\nLXVII.--There was a debate in the council between Afranius and Petreius,\r\nand the time of marching was the subject. The majority were of opinion\r\nthat they should begin their march at night, \"for they might reach the\r\ndefiles before they should be discovered.\" Others, because a shout had\r\nbeen raised the night before in Caesar's camp, used this as an argument\r\nthat they could not leave the camp unnoticed: \"that Caesar's cavalry\r\nwere patrolling the whole night, and that all the ways and roads were\r\nbeset; that battles at night ought to be avoided, because in civil\r\ndissension, a soldier once daunted is more apt to consult his fears than\r\nhis oath; that the daylight raised a strong sense of shame in the eyes\r\nof all, and that the presence of the tribunes and centurions had the\r\nsame effect: by these things the soldiers would be re strained and awed\r\nto their duty. Wherefore they should, by all means, attempt to force\r\ntheir way by day; for, though a trifling loss might be sustained, yet\r\nthe post which they desired might be secured with safety to the main\r\nbody of the army.\" This opinion prevailed in the council, and the next\r\nday, at the dawn, they resolved to set forward.\r\n\r\nLXVIII.--Caesar, having taken a view of the country, the moment the sky\r\nbegan to grow white, led his forces from the camp and marched at the\r\nhead of his army by a long circuit, keeping to no regular road; for the\r\nroad which led to the Ebro and Octogesa was occupied by the enemy's\r\ncamp, which lay in Caesar's way. His soldiers were obliged to cross\r\nextensive and difficult valleys. Craggy cliffs, in several places,\r\ninterrupted their march, insomuch that their arms had to be handed to\r\none another, and the soldiers were forced to perform a great part of\r\ntheir march unarmed, and were lifted up the rocks by each other. But not\r\na man murmured at the fatigue, because they imagined that there would be\r\na period to all their toils if they could cut off the enemy from the\r\nEbro and intercept their convoys.\r\n\r\nLXIX.--At first, Afranius's soldiers ran in high spirits from their camp\r\nto look at us, and in contumelious language upbraided us, \"that we were\r\nforced, for want of necessary subsistence, to run away, and return to\r\nIlerda.\" For our route was different from what we proposed, and we\r\nappeared to be going a contrary way. But their generals applauded their\r\nown prudence in keeping within their camp, and it was a strong\r\nconfirmation of their opinion, that they saw we marched without waggons\r\nor baggage, which made them confident that we could not long endure\r\nwant. But when they saw our army gradually wheel to the right, and\r\nobserved our van was already passing the line of their camp, there was\r\nnobody so stupid, or averse to fatigue, as not to think it necessary to\r\nmarch from the camp immediately, and oppose us. The cry to arms was\r\nraised, and all the army, except a few which were left to guard the\r\ncamp, set out and marched the direct road to the Ebro.\r\n\r\nLXX.--The contest depended entirely on despatch, which should first get\r\npossession of the defile and the mountain. The difficulty of the roads\r\ndelayed Caesar's army, but his cavalry pursuing Afranius's forces,\r\nretarded their march. However, the affair was necessarily reduced to\r\nthis point, with respect to Afranius's men, that if they first gained\r\nthe mountains, which they desired, they would themselves avoid all\r\ndanger, but could not save the baggage of their whole army, nor the\r\ncohorts which they had left behind in the camps, to which, being\r\nintercepted by Caesar's army, by no means could assistance be given.\r\nCaesar first accomplished the march, and having found a plain behind\r\nlarge rocks, drew up his army there in order of battle and facing the\r\nenemy. Afranius, perceiving that his rear was galled by our cavalry, and\r\nseeing the enemy before him, having come to a hill, made a halt on it.\r\nThence he detached four cohorts of Spanish light infantry to the highest\r\nmountain which was in view: to this he ordered them to hasten with all\r\nexpedition, and to take possession of it, with the intention of going to\r\nthe same place with all his forces, then altering his route, and\r\ncrossing the hills to Octogesa. As the Spaniards were making towards it\r\nin an oblique direction, Caesar's horse espied them and attacked them,\r\nnor were they able to withstand the charge of the cavalry even for a\r\nmoment, but were all surrounded and cut to pieces in the sight of the\r\ntwo armies.\r\n\r\nLXXI.--There was now an opportunity for managing affairs successfully,\r\nnor did it escape Caesar, that an army daunted at suffering such a loss\r\nbefore their eyes, could not stand, especially as they were surrounded\r\nby our horse, and the engagement would take place on even and open\r\nground. To this he was importuned on all sides. The lieutenants,\r\ncenturions, and tribunes, gathered round him, and begged \"that he would\r\nnot hesitate to begin the battle: that the hearts of all the soldiers\r\nwere very anxious for it: that Afranius's men had by several\r\ncircumstances betrayed signs of fear; in that they had not assisted\r\ntheir party; in that they had not quitted the hill; in that they did not\r\nsustain the charge of our cavalry, but crowding their standards into one\r\nplace, did not observe either rank or order. But if he had any\r\napprehensions from the disadvantage of the ground, that an opportunity\r\nwould be given him of coming to battle in some other place: for that\r\nAfranius must certainly come down, and would not be able to remain there\r\nfor want of water.\"\r\n\r\nLXXII.--Caesar had conceived hopes of ending the affair without an\r\nengagement, or without striking a blow, because he had cut off the\r\nenemy's supplies. Why should he hazard the loss of any of his men, even\r\nin a successful battle? Why should he expose soldiers to be wounded; who\r\nhad deserved so well of him? Why, in short, should he tempt fortune?\r\nespecially when it was as much a general's duty to conquer by tactics,\r\nas by the sword. Besides, he was moved with compassion for those\r\ncitizens, who, he foresaw, must fall: and he had rather gain his object\r\nwithout any loss or injury to them. This resolution of Caesar was not\r\ngenerally approved of; but the soldiers openly declared to each other,\r\nthat since such an opportunity of victory was let pass, they would not\r\ncome to an engagement, even when Caesar should wish it. He persevered\r\nhowever in his resolution, and retired a little from that place to abate\r\nthe enemy's fears. Petreius and Afranius, having got this opportunity,\r\nretired to their camp. Caesar, having disposed parties on the mountains,\r\nand cut off all access to the Ebro, fortified his camp as close to the\r\nenemy as he could.\r\n\r\nLXXIII.--The day following, the generals of his opponents, being alarmed\r\nthat they had lost all prospect of supplies, and of access to the Ebro,\r\nconsulted as to what other course they should take. There were two\r\nroads, one to Ilerda, if they chose to return, the other to Tarraco, if\r\nthey should march to it. Whilst they were deliberating on these matters,\r\nintelligence was brought them that their watering parties were attacked\r\nby our horse: upon which information, they dispose several parties of\r\nhorse and auxiliary foot along the road, and intermix some legionary\r\ncohorts, and begin to throw up a rampart from the camp to the water,\r\nthat they might be able to procure water within their lines, both\r\nwithout fear, and without a guard. Petreius and Afranius divided this\r\ntask between themselves, and went in person to some distance from their\r\ncamp for the purpose of seeing it accomplished.\r\n\r\nLXXIV.--The soldiers having obtained by their absence a free opportunity\r\nof conversing with each other, came out in great numbers, and inquired\r\neach for whatever acquaintance or fellow citizen he had in our camp, and\r\ninvited him to him. First they returned them general thanks for sparing\r\nthem the day before, when they were greatly terrified, and acknowledged\r\nthat they were alive through their kindness; then they inquired about\r\nthe honour of our general, and whether they could with safety entrust\r\nthemselves to him; and declared their sorrow that they had not done so\r\nin the beginning, and that they had taken up arms against their\r\nrelations and kinsmen. Encouraged by these conferences, they desired the\r\ngeneral's parole for the lives of Petreius and Afranius, that they might\r\nnot appear guilty of a crime, in having betrayed their generals. When\r\nthey were assured of obtaining their demands, they promised that they\r\nwould immediately remove their standards, and sent centurions of the\r\nfirst rank as deputies to treat with Caesar about a peace. In the\r\nmeantime some of them invite their acquaintances, and bring them to\r\ntheir camp, others are brought away by their friends, so that the two\r\ncamps seemed to be united into one, and several of the tribunes and\r\ncenturions came to Caesar, and paid their respects to him. The same was\r\ndone by some of the nobility of Spain, whom they summoned to their\r\nassistance, and kept in their camp as hostages. They inquired after\r\ntheir acquaintance and friends, by whom each might have the means of\r\nbeing recommended to Caesar. Even Afranius's son, a young man,\r\nendeavoured by means of Sulpitius the lieutenant, to make terms for his\r\nown and his father's life. Every place was filled with mirth and\r\ncongratulations; in the one army, because they thought they had escaped\r\nso impending danger; in the other, because they thought they had\r\ncompleted so important a matter without blows; and Caesar, in every\r\nman's judgment, reaped the advantage of his former lenity, and his\r\nconduct was applauded by all.\r\n\r\nLXXV.--When these circumstances were announced to Afranius, he left the\r\nwork which he had begun, and returned to his camp determined, as it\r\nappeared, whatever should be the event to bear it with an even and\r\nsteady mind. Petreius did not neglect himself; he armed his domestics;\r\nwith them and the praetorian cohort of Spaniards, and a few foreign\r\nhorse, his dependants, whom he commonly kept near him to guard his\r\nperson, he suddenly flew to the rampart, interrupted the conferences of\r\nthe soldiers, drove our men from the camp, and put to death as many as\r\nhe caught. The rest formed into a body, and, being alarmed by the\r\nunexpected danger, wrapped their left arms in their cloaks, and drew\r\ntheir swords, and in this manner, depending on the nearness of their\r\ncamp, defended themselves against the Spaniards, and the horse, and made\r\ngood their retreat to the camp, where they were protected by the\r\ncohorts, which were on guard.\r\n\r\nLXXVI.--Petreius, after accomplishing this, went round every maniple,\r\ncalling the soldiers by their names and entreating with tears, that they\r\nwould not give up him and their absent general Pompey, as a sacrifice to\r\nthe vengeance of their enemies. Immediately they ran in crowds to the\r\ngeneral's pavilion, when he required them all to take an oath that they\r\nwould not desert nor betray the army nor the generals, nor form any\r\ndesign distinct from the general interest. He himself swore first to the\r\ntenor of those words, and obliged Afranius to take the same oath. The\r\ntribunes and centurions followed their example; the soldiers were\r\nbrought out by centuries, and took the same oath. They gave orders, that\r\nwhoever had any of Caesar's soldiers should produce them; as soon as\r\nthey were produced, they put them to death publicly in the praetorium,\r\nbut most of them concealed those that they had entertained, and let them\r\nout at night over the rampart. Thus the terror raised by the generals,\r\nthe cruelty of the punishments, the new obligation of an oath, removed\r\nall hopes of surrender for the present, changed the soldiers' minds, and\r\nreduced matters to the former state of war.\r\n\r\nLXXVII.--Caesar ordered the enemy's soldiers, who had come into his camp\r\nto hold a conference, to be searched for with the strictest diligence,\r\nand sent back. But of the tribunes and centurions, several voluntarily\r\nremained with him, and he afterwards treated them with great respect.\r\nThe centurions he promoted to higher ranks, and conferred on the Roman\r\nknights the honour of tribunes.\r\n\r\nLXXVIII.--Afranius's men were distressed in foraging, and procured water\r\nwith difficulty. The legionary soldiers had a tolerable supply of corn,\r\nbecause they had been ordered to bring from Ilerda sufficient to last\r\ntwenty-two days; the Spanish and auxiliary forces had none, for they had\r\nbut few opportunities of procuring any, and their bodies were not\r\naccustomed to bear burdens; and therefore a great number of them came\r\nover to Caesar every day. Their affairs were under these difficulties;\r\nbut of the two schemes proposed, the most expedient seemed to be to\r\nreturn to Ilerda, because they had left some corn there; and there they\r\nhoped to decide on a plan for their future conduct. Tarraco lay at a\r\ngreater distance; and in such a space they knew affairs might admit of\r\nmany changes. Their design having met with approbation, they set out\r\nfrom their camp. Caesar having sent forward his cavalry, to annoy and\r\nretard their rear, followed close after with his legions. Not a moment\r\npassed in which their rear was not engaged with our horse.\r\n\r\nLXXIX.--Their manner of fighting was this: the light cohorts closed\r\ntheir rear, and frequently made a stand on the level grounds. If they\r\nhad a mountain to ascend, the very nature of the place readily secured\r\nthem from any danger; for the advanced guards, from the rising grounds,\r\nprotected the rest in their ascent. When they approached a valley or\r\ndeclivity, and the advanced men could not impart assistance to the\r\ntardy, our horse threw their darts at them from the rising grounds with\r\nadvantage; then their affairs were in a perilous situation; the only\r\nplan left was, that whenever they came near such places, they should\r\ngive orders to the legions to halt, and by a violent effort repulse our\r\nhorse; and these being forced to give way, they should suddenly, with\r\nthe utmost speed, run all together down to the valley, and having passed\r\nit, should face about again on the next hill. For so far were they from\r\nderiving any assistance from their horse (of which they had a large\r\nnumber), that they were obliged to receive them into the centre of their\r\narmy, and themselves protect them, as they were daunted by former\r\nbattles. And on their march no one could quit the line without being\r\ntaken by Caesar's horse.\r\n\r\nLXXX.--Whilst skirmishes were fought in this manner, they advanced but\r\nslowly and gradually, and frequently halted to help their rear, as then\r\nhappened. For having advanced four miles, and being very much harassed\r\nby our horse, they took post on a high mountain, and there entrenched\r\nthemselves on the front only, facing the enemy; and did not take their\r\nbaggage off their cattle. When they perceived that Caesar's camp was\r\npitched, and the tents fixed up, and his horse sent out to forage, they\r\nsuddenly rushed out about twelve o'clock the same day, and, having hopes\r\nthat we should be delayed by the absence of our horse, they began to\r\nmarch, which Caesar perceiving, followed them with the legions that\r\nremained. He left a few cohorts to guard his baggage, and ordered the\r\nforagers to be called home at the tenth hour, and the horse to follow\r\nhim. The horse shortly returned to their daily duty on march, and\r\ncharged the rear so vigorously, that they almost forced them to fly; and\r\nseveral privates and some centurions were killed. The main body of\r\nCaesar's army was at hand, and universal ruin threatened them.\r\n\r\nLXXXI.--Then indeed, not having opportunity either to choose a\r\nconvenient position for their camp, or to march forward, they were\r\nobliged to halt, and to encamp at a distance from water, and on ground\r\nnaturally unfavourable. But for the reasons already given, Caesar did\r\nnot attack them, nor suffer a tent to be pitched that day, that his men\r\nmight be the readier to pursue them whether they attempted to run off by\r\nnight or by day. Observing the defect in their position, they spent the\r\nwhole night in extending their works, and turn their camp to ours. The\r\nnext day, at dawn, they do the same, and spend the whole day in that\r\nmanner, but in proportion as they advanced their works, and extended\r\ntheir camp, they were farther distant from the water; and one evil was\r\nremedied by another. The first night, no one went out for water. The\r\nnext day, they left a guard in the camp, and led out all their forces to\r\nwater: but not a person was sent to look for forage. Caesar was more\r\ndesirous that they should be humbled by these means, and forced to come\r\nto terms, than decide the contest by battle. Yet he endeavoured to\r\nsurround them with a wall and trench, that he might be able to check\r\ntheir most sudden sally, to which he imagined that they must have\r\nrecourse. Hereupon, urged by want of fodder, that they might be the\r\nreadier for a march, they killed all their baggage cattle.\r\n\r\nLXXXII.--In this work, and the deliberations on it, two days were spent.\r\nBy the third day a considerable part of Caesar's works was finished. To\r\ninterrupt his progress, they drew out their legions about the eighth\r\nhour, by a certain signal, and placed them in order of battle before\r\ntheir camp. Caesar calling his legions off from their work, and ordering\r\nthe horse to hold themselves in readiness, marshalled his army: for to\r\nappear to decline an engagement contrary to the opinion of the soldiers\r\nand the general voice, would have been attended with great disadvantage.\r\nBut for the reasons already known, he was dissuaded from wishing to\r\nengage, and the more especially, because the short space between the\r\ncamps, even if the enemy were put to flight, would not contribute much\r\nto a decisive victory; for the two camps were not distant from each\r\nother above two thousand feet. Two parts of this were occupied by the\r\narmies, and one third left for the soldiers to charge and make their\r\nattack. If a battle should be begun, the nearness of the camps would\r\nafford a ready retreat to the conquered party in the flight. For this\r\nreason Caesar had resolved to make resistance, if they attacked him, but\r\nnot to be the first to provoke the battle.\r\n\r\nLXXXIII.--Afranius's five legions were drawn up in two lines, the\r\nauxiliary cohorts formed the third line, and acted as reserves. Caesar\r\nhad three lines, four cohorts out of each of the five legions formed the\r\nfirst line. Three more from each legion followed them, as reserves: and\r\nthree others were behind these. The slingers and archers were stationed\r\nin the centre of the line; the cavalry closed the flanks. The hostile\r\narmies being arranged in this manner, each seemed determined to adhere\r\nto his first intention: Caesar not to hazard a battle, unless forced to\r\nit; Afranius to interrupt Caesar's works. However, the matter was\r\ndeferred, and both armies kept under arms till sunset; when they both\r\nreturned to their camp. The next day Caesar prepared to finish the works\r\nwhich he had begun. The enemy attempted to pass the river Segre by a\r\nford. Caesar, having perceived this, sent some light-armed Germans and a\r\nparty of horse across the river, and disposed several parties along the\r\nbanks to guard them.\r\n\r\nLXXXIV.--At length, beset on all sides, their cattle having been four\r\ndays without fodder, and having no water, wood, or corn, they beg a\r\nconference; and that, if possible, in a place remote from the soldiers.\r\nWhen this was refused by Caesar, but a public interview offered if they\r\nchose it, Afranius's son was given as a hostage to Caesar. They met in\r\nthe place appointed by Caesar. In the hearing of both armies, Afranius\r\nspoke thus: \"That Caesar ought not to be displeased either with him or\r\nhis soldiers, for wishing to preserve their attachment to their general,\r\nCneius Pompey. That they had now sufficiently discharged their duty to\r\nhim, and had suffered punishment enough, in having endured the want of\r\nevery necessary: but now, pent up almost like wild beasts, they were\r\nprevented from procuring water, and prevented from walking abroad; and\r\nwere not able to bear the bodily pain or the mental disgrace: but\r\nconfessed themselves vanquished: and begged and entreated, if there was\r\nany room left for mercy, that they should not be necessitated to suffer\r\nthe most severe penalties.\" These sentiments were delivered in the most\r\nsubmissive and humble language.\r\n\r\nLXXXV.--Caesar replied, \"That either to complain or sue for mercy became\r\nno man less than him: for that every other person had done their duty:\r\nhimself, in having declined to engage on favourable terms, in an\r\nadvantageous situation and time, that all things tending to a peace\r\nmight be totally unembarrassed: his army, in having preserved and\r\nprotected the men whom they had in their power, notwithstanding the\r\ninjuries which they had received, and the murder of their comrades; and\r\neven Afranius's soldiers, who of themselves treated about concluding a\r\npeace, by which they thought that they would secure the lives of all.\r\nThus, that the parties on both sides inclined to mercy: that the\r\ngenerals only were averse to peace: that they paid no regard to the laws\r\neither of conference or truce; and had most inhumanly put to death\r\nignorant persons, who were deceived by a conference: that therefore,\r\nthey had met that fate which usually befalls men from excessive\r\nobstinacy and arrogance; and were obliged to have recourse, and most\r\nearnestly desire that which they had shortly before disdained. That for\r\nhis part, he would not avail himself of their present humiliation, or\r\nhis present advantage, to require terms by which his power might be\r\nincreased, but only that those armies, which they had maintained for so\r\nmany years to oppose him, should be disbanded: for six legions had been\r\nsent into Spain, and a seventh raised there, and many and powerful\r\nfleets provided, and generals of great military experience sent to\r\ncommand them, for no other purpose than to oppose him; that none of\r\nthese measures were adopted to keep the Spains in peace, or for the use\r\nof the province, which, from the length of the peace, stood in need of\r\nno such aid; that all these things were long since designed against him:\r\nthat against him a new sort of government was established, that the same\r\nperson should be at the gates of Rome, to direct the affairs of the\r\ncity; and though absent, have the government of two most warlike\r\nprovinces for so many years: that against him the laws of the\r\nmagistrates had been altered; that the late praetors and consuls should\r\nnot be sent to govern the provinces as had been the constant custom, but\r\npersons approved of and chosen by a faction. That against him the excuse\r\nof age was not admitted: but persons of tried experience in former wars\r\nwere called up to take the command of the armies, that with respect to\r\nhim only, the routine was not observed which had been allowed to all\r\ngenerals, that, after a successful war, they should return home and\r\ndisband their armies, if not with some mark of honour, at least without\r\ndisgrace: that he had submitted to all these things patiently, and would\r\nstill submit to them: nor did he now desire to take their army from them\r\nand keep it to himself (which, however, would not be a difficult\r\nmatter), but only that they should not have it to employ against him:\r\nand therefore, as he said before, let them quit the provinces, and\r\ndisband their army. If this was complied with, he would injure no\r\nperson; that these were the last and only conditions of peace.\"\r\n\r\nLXXXVI.--It was very acceptable and agreeable to Afranius's soldiers, as\r\nmight be easily known from their signs of joy, that they who expected\r\nsome injury after this defeat, should obtain without solicitation the\r\nreward of a dismissal. For when a debate was introduced about the place\r\nand time of their dismissal, they all began to express, both by words\r\nand signs, from the rampart where they stood, that they should be\r\ndischarged immediately: for although every security might be given that\r\nthey would be disbanded, still the matter would be uncertain, if it was\r\ndeferred to a future day. After a short debate on either side, it was\r\nbrought to this issue: that those who had any settlement or possession\r\nin Spain, should be immediately discharged: the rest at the river Var.\r\nCaesar gave security that they should receive no damage, and that no\r\nperson should be obliged against his inclination to take the military\r\noath under him.\r\n\r\nLXXXVII.--Caesar promised to supply them with corn from the present\r\ntime, till they arrived at the river Var. He further adds, that whatever\r\nany of them lost in the war, which was in the possession of his\r\nsoldiers, should be restored to those that lost them. To his soldiers he\r\nmade a recompense in money for those things, a just valuation being\r\nmade. Whatever disputes Afranius's soldiers had afterwards amongst\r\nthemselves, they voluntarily submitted to Caesar's decision. Afranius\r\nand Petreius, when pay was demanded by the legions, a sedition almost\r\nbreaking out, asserted that the time had not yet come, and required that\r\nCaesar should take cognizance of it: and both parties were content with\r\nhis decision. About a third part of their army being dismissed in two\r\ndays, Caesar ordered two of his legions to go before, the rest to follow\r\nthe vanquished enemy: that they should encamp at a small distance from\r\neach other. The execution of this business he gave in charge to Quintus\r\nFufius Kalenus, one of his lieutenants. According to his directions,\r\nthey marched from Spain to the river Var, and there the rest of the army\r\nwas disbanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\nI.--Whilst these things were going forward in Spain, Caius Trebonius,\r\nCaesar's lieutenant, who had been left to conduct the assault of\r\nMassilia, began to raise a mound, vineae, and turrets against the town,\r\non two sides: one of which was next the harbour and docks, the other on\r\nthat part where there is a passage from Gaul and Spain to that sea which\r\nforces itself up the mouth of the Rhone. For Massilia is washed almost\r\non three sides by the sea, the remaining fourth part is the only side\r\nwhich has access by land. A part even of this space, which reaches to\r\nthe fortress, being fortified by the nature of the country, and a very\r\ndeep valley, required a long and difficult siege. To accomplish these\r\nworks, Caius Trebonius sends for a great quantity of carriages and men\r\nfrom the whole Province, and orders hurdles and materials to be\r\nfurnished. These things being provided, he raised a mound eighty feet in\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nII.--But so great a store of everything necessary for a war had been a\r\nlong time before laid up in the town, and so great a number of engines,\r\nthat no vineae made of hurdles could withstand their force. For poles\r\ntwelve feet in length, pointed with iron, and these too shot from very\r\nlarge engines, sank into the ground through four rows of hurdles.\r\nTherefore the arches of the vineae were covered over with beams a foot\r\nthick, fastened together, and under this the materials of the agger were\r\nhanded from one to another. Before this was carried a testudo sixty feet\r\nlong, for levelling the ground, made also of very strong timber, and\r\ncovered over with every thing that was capable of protecting it against\r\nthe fire and stones thrown by the enemy. But the greatness of the works,\r\nthe height of the wall and towers, and the multitude of engines retarded\r\nthe progress of our works. Besides, frequent sallies were made from the\r\ntown by the Albici, and fire was thrown on our mound and turrets. These\r\nour men easily repulsed, and, doing considerable damage to those who\r\nsallied, beat them back into the town.\r\n\r\nIII.--In the meantime, Lucius Nasidius, being sent by Cneius Pompey with\r\na fleet of sixteen sail, a few of which had beaks of brass, to the\r\nassistance of Lucius Domitius and the Massilians, passed the straits of\r\nSicily without the knowledge or expectation of Curio, and, putting with\r\nhis fleet into Messana, and making the nobles and senate take flight\r\nwith the sudden terror, carried off one of their ships out of dock.\r\nHaving joined this to his other ships, he made good his voyage to\r\nMassilia, and, having sent in a galley privately, acquaints Domitius and\r\nthe Massilians of his arrival, and earnestly encourages them to hazard\r\nanother battle with Brutus's fleet with the addition of his aid.\r\n\r\nIV.--The Massilians, since their former loss, had brought the same\r\nnumber of old ships from the docks, and had repaired and fitted them out\r\nwith great industry: they had a large supply of seamen and pilots. They\r\nhad got several fishing-smacks, and covered them over, that the seamen\r\nmight be secure against darts: these they filled with archers and\r\nengines. With a fleet thus appointed, encouraged by the entreaties and\r\ntears of all the old men, matrons, and virgins to succour the state in\r\nthis hour of distress, they went on board with no less spirit and\r\nconfidence than they had fought before. For it happens, from a common\r\ninfirmity of human nature, that we are more flushed with confidence, or\r\nmore vehemently alarmed at things unseen, concealed, and unknown, as was\r\nthe case then. For the arrival of Lucius Nasidius had filled the state\r\nwith the most sanguine hopes and wishes. Having got a fair wind, they\r\nsailed out of port and went to Nasidius to Taurois, which is a fort\r\nbelonging to the Massilians, and there ranged their fleet and again\r\nencouraged each other to engage, and communicated their plan of\r\noperation. The command of the right division was given to the\r\nMassilians, that of the left to Nasidius.\r\n\r\nV.--Brutus sailed to the same place with an augmented fleet: for to\r\nthose made by Caesar at Arelas were added six ships taken from the\r\nMassilians, which he had refitted since the last battle and had\r\nfurnished with every necessary. Accordingly, having encouraged his men\r\nto despise a vanquished people whom they had conquered when yet\r\nunbroken, he advanced against them full of confidence and spirit. From\r\nTrebonius's camp and all the higher grounds it was easy to see into the\r\ntown--how all the youth which remained in it, and all persons of more\r\nadvanced years, with their wives and children, and the public guards,\r\nwere either extending their hands from the wall to the heavens, or were\r\nrepairing to the temples of the immortal gods, and, prostrating\r\nthemselves before their images, were entreating them to grant them\r\nvictory. Nor was there a single person who did not imagine that his\r\nfuture fortune depended on the issue of that day; for the choice of\r\ntheir youth and the most respectable of every age, being expressly\r\ninvited and solicited, had gone on board the fleet, that if any adverse\r\nfate should befall them they might see that nothing was left for them to\r\nattempt, and, if they proved victorious, they might have hopes of\r\npreserving the city, either by their internal resources or by foreign\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nVI-.-When the battle was begun, no effort of valour was wanting to the\r\nMassilians, but, mindful of the instructions which they had a little\r\nbefore received from their friends, they fought with such spirit as if\r\nthey supposed that they would never have another opportunity to attempt\r\na defence, and as if they believed that those whose lives should be\r\nendangered in the battle would not long precede the fate of the rest of\r\nthe citizens, who, if the city was taken, must undergo the same fortune\r\nof war. Our ships being at some distance from each other, room was\r\nallowed both for the skill of their pilots and the manoeuvring of their\r\nships; and if at any time ours, gaining an advantage by casting the iron\r\nhooks on board their ships, grappled with them, from all parts they\r\nassisted those who were distressed. Nor, after being joined by the\r\nAlbici, did they decline coming to close engagement, nor were they much\r\ninferior to our men in valour. At the same time, showers of darts,\r\nthrown from a distance from the lesser ships, suddenly inflicted several\r\nwounds on our men when off their guard and otherwise engaged; and two of\r\ntheir three-decked galleys, having descried the ship of Decimus Brutus,\r\nwhich could be easily distinguished by its flag, rowed up against him\r\nwith great violence from opposite sides: but Brutus, seeing into their\r\ndesigns, by the swiftness of his ship extricated himself with such\r\naddress as to get clear, though only by a moment. From the velocity of\r\ntheir motion they struck against each other with such violence that they\r\nwere both excessively injured by the shock; the beak, indeed, of one of\r\nthem being broken off, the whole ship was ready to founder, which\r\ncircumstance being observed, the ships of Brutus's fleet, which were\r\nnearest that station, attack them when in this disorder and sink them\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nVII.--But Nasidius's ships were of no use, and soon left the fight; for\r\nthe sight of their country, or the entreaties of their relations, did\r\nnot urge them to run a desperate risk of their lives. Therefore, of the\r\nnumber of the ships not one was lost: of the fleet of the Massilians\r\nfive were sunk, four taken, and one ran off with Nasidius: all that\r\nescaped made the best of their way to Hither Spain, but one of the rest\r\nwas sent forward to Massilia for the purpose of bearing this\r\nintelligence, and when it came near the city, the whole people crowded\r\nout to hear the tidings, and on being informed of the event, were so\r\noppressed with grief, that one would have imagined that the city had\r\nbeen taken by an enemy at the same moment. The Massilians, however,\r\nbegan to make the necessary preparations for the defence of their city\r\nwith unwearied energy.\r\n\r\nVIII.--The legionary soldiers who had the management of the works on the\r\nright side observed, from the frequent sallies of the enemy, that it\r\nmight prove a great protection to them to build a turret of brick under\r\nthe wall for a fort and place of refuge, which they at first built low\r\nand small, [to guard them] against sudden attacks. To it they retreated,\r\nand from it they made defence if any superior force attacked them; and\r\nfrom it they sallied out either to repel or pursue the enemy. It\r\nextended thirty feet on every side, and the thickness of the walls was\r\nfive feet. But afterwards, as experience is the best master in\r\neverything on which the wit of man is employed, it was found that it\r\nmight be of considerable service if it was raised to the usual height of\r\nturrets, which was effected in the following manner.\r\n\r\nIX.-When the turret was raised to the height for flooring, they laid it\r\non the walls in such a manner that the ends of the joists were covered\r\nby the outer face of the wall, that nothing should project to which the\r\nenemy's fire might adhere. They, moreover, built over the joists with\r\nsmall bricks as high as the protection of the plutei and vineae\r\npermitted them; and on that place they laid two beams across, angle-ways,\r\nat a small distance from the outer walls, to support the rafters\r\nwhich were to cover the turret, and on the beams they laid joists across\r\nin a direct line, and on these they fastened down planks. These joists\r\nthey made somewhat longer, to project beyond the outside of the wall,\r\nthat they might serve to hang a curtain on them to defend and repel all\r\nblows whilst they were building the walls between that and the next\r\nfloor, and the floor of this story they faced with bricks and mortar,\r\nthat the enemy's fire might do them no damage; and on this they spread\r\nmattresses, lest the weapons thrown from engines should break through\r\nthe flooring, or stones from catapults should batter the brickwork.\r\nThey, moreover, made three mats of cable ropes, each of them the length\r\nof the turret walls, and four feet broad, and, hanging them round the\r\nturret on the three sides which faced the enemy, fastened them to the\r\nprojecting joists. For this was the only sort of defence which, they had\r\nlearned by experience in other places, could not be pierced by darts or\r\nengines. But when that part of the turret which was completed was\r\nprotected and secured against every attempt of the enemy, they removed\r\nthe plutei to other works. They began to suspend gradually, and raise by\r\nscrews from the first-floor, the entire roof of the turret, and then\r\nthey elevated it as high as the length of the mats allowed. Hid and\r\nsecured within these coverings, they built up the walls with bricks, and\r\nagain, by another turn of the screw, cleared a place for themselves to\r\nproceed with the building; and, when they thought it time to lay another\r\nfloor, they laid the ends of the beams, covered in by the outer bricks\r\nin like manner as in the first story, and from that story they again\r\nraised the uppermost floor and the mat-work. In this manner, securely\r\nand without a blow or danger, they raised it six stories high, and in\r\nlaying the materials left loop-holes in such places as they thought\r\nproper for working their engines.\r\n\r\nX.--When they were confident that they could protect the works which lay\r\naround from this turret, they resolved to build a musculus, sixty feet\r\nlong, of timber, two feet square, and to extend it from the brick tower\r\nto the enemy's tower and wall. This was the form of it: two beams of\r\nequal length were laid on the ground, at the distance of four feet from\r\neach other; and in them were fastened small pillars, five feet high,\r\nwhich were joined together by braces, with a gentle slope, on which the\r\ntimber which they must place to support the roof of the musculus should\r\nbe laid: upon this were laid beams, two feet square, bound with iron\r\nplates and nails. To the upper covering of the musculus and the upper\r\nbeams, they fastened laths, four fingers square, to support the tiles\r\nwhich were to cover the musculus. The roof being thus sloped and laid\r\nover in rows in the same manner as the joists were laid on the braces,\r\nthe musculus was covered with tiles and mortar, to secure it against\r\nfire, which might be thrown from the wall. Over the tiles hides are\r\nspread, to prevent the water let in on them by spouts from dissolving\r\nthe cement of the bricks. Again, the hides were covered over with\r\nmattresses, that they might not be destroyed by fire or stones. The\r\nsoldiers under the protection of the vineae, finish this whole work to\r\nthe very tower, and suddenly, before the enemy were aware of it, moved\r\nit forward by naval machinery, by putting rollers under it, close up to\r\nthe enemy's turret, so that it even touched the building.\r\n\r\nXI.--The townsmen, affrighted at this unexpected stroke, bring forward\r\nwith levers the largest stones they can procure; and pitching them from\r\nthe wall, roll them down on the musculus. The strength of the timber\r\nwithstood the shock; and whatever fell on it slid off, on account of the\r\nsloping roof. When they perceived this, they altered their plan and set\r\nfire to barrels, filled with resin and tar, and rolled them down from\r\nthe wall on the musculus. As soon as they fell on it, they slid off\r\nagain, and were removed from its side by long poles and forks. In the\r\nmeantime, the soldiers, under cover of the musculus, were looting out\r\nwith crowbars the lowest stones of the enemy's turret, with which the\r\nfoundation was laid. The musculus was defended by darts, thrown from\r\nengines by our men from the brick tower, and the enemy were beaten off\r\nfrom the wall and turrets; nor was a fair opportunity of defending the\r\nwalls given them. At length several stones being picked away from the\r\nfoundation of that turret next the musculus, part of it fell down\r\nsuddenly, and the rest, as if following it, leaned forward.\r\n\r\nXII.--Hereupon, the enemy, distressed at the sudden fall of the turret,\r\nsurprised at the unforeseen calamity, awed by the wrath of the gods, and\r\ndreading the pillage of their city, rush all together out of the gate\r\nunarmed, with their temples bound with fillets, and suppliantly stretch\r\nout their hands to the officers and the army. At this uncommon\r\noccurrence, the whole progress of the war was stopped, and the soldiers,\r\nturning away from the battle, ran eagerly to hear and listen to them.\r\nWhen the enemy came up to the commanders and the army, they all fell\r\ndown at their feet, and besought them \"to wait till Caesar's arrival;\r\nthey saw that their city was taken, our works completed, and their tower\r\nundermined, therefore they desisted from a defence; that no obstacle\r\ncould arise, to prevent their being instantly plundered at a beck, as\r\nsoon as he arrived, if they refused to submit to his orders.\" They\r\ninform them that, \"if the turret had entirely fallen down, the soldiers\r\ncould not be withheld from forcing into the town and sacking it, in\r\nhopes of getting spoil.\" These and several other arguments to the same\r\neffect were delivered, as they were a people of great learning, with\r\ngreat pathos and lamentations.\r\n\r\nXIII.--The lieutenants, moved with compassion, draw off the soldiers\r\nfrom the work, desist from the assault, and leave sentinels on the\r\nworks. A sort of a truce having been made through compassion for the\r\nbesieged, the arrival of Caesar is anxiously awaited; not a dart was\r\nthrown from the walls or by our men, but all remit their care and\r\ndiligence, as if the business was at an end. For Caesar had given\r\nTrebonius strict charge not to suffer the town to be taken by storm,\r\nlest the soldiers, too much irritated both by abhorrence of their\r\nrevolt, by the contempt shown to them, and by their long labour, should\r\nput to the sword all the grown-up inhabitants, as they threatened to do.\r\nAnd it was with difficulty that they were then restrained from breaking\r\ninto the town, and they were much displeased, because they imagined that\r\nthey were prevented by Trebonius from taking possession of it.\r\n\r\nXIV.--But the enemy, destitute of all honour, only waited a time and\r\nopportunity for fraud and treachery. And after an interval of some days,\r\nwhen our men were careless and negligent, on a sudden, at noon, when\r\nsome were dispersed, and others indulging themselves in rest on the very\r\nworks, after the fatigue of the day, and their arms were all laid by and\r\ncovered up, they sallied out from the gates, and, the wind being high\r\nand favourable to them, they set fire to our works; and the wind spread\r\nit in such a manner that, in the same instant, the agger, plutei,\r\ntestudo, tower, and engines all caught the flames and were consumed\r\nbefore we could conceive how it had occurred. Our men, alarmed at such\r\nan unexpected turn of fortune, lay hold on such arms as they could find.\r\nSome rush from the camp; an attack is made on the enemy: but they were\r\nprevented, by arrows and engines from the walls, from pursuing them when\r\nthey fled. They retired to their walls, and there, without fear, set the\r\nmusculus and brick tower on fire. Thus, by the perfidy of the enemy and\r\nthe violence of the storm, the labour of many months was destroyed in a\r\nmoment. The Massilians made the same attempt the next day, having got\r\nsuch another storm. They sallied out against the other tower and agger,\r\nand fought with more confidence. But as our men had on the former\r\noccasion given up all thoughts of a contest, so, warned by the event of\r\nthe preceding day, they had made every preparation for a defence.\r\nAccordingly, they slew several, and forced the rest to retreat into the\r\ntown without effecting their design.\r\n\r\nXV.--Trebonius began to provide and repair what had been destroyed, with\r\nmuch greater zeal on the part of the soldiers; for when they saw that\r\ntheir extraordinary pains and preparations had an unfortunate issue,\r\nthey were fired with indignation that, in consequence of the impious\r\nviolation of the truce, their valour should be held in derision. There\r\nwas no place left them from which the materials for their mound could be\r\nfetched, in consequence of all the timber, far and wide, in the\r\nterritories of the Massilians, having been cut down and carried away;\r\nthey began therefore to make an agger of a new construction, never heard\r\nof before, of two walls of brick, each six feet thick, and to lay floors\r\nover them of almost the same breadth with the agger, made of timber. But\r\nwherever the space between the walls, or the weakness of the timber,\r\nseemed to require it, pillars were placed underneath and traversed beams\r\nlaid on to strengthen the work, and the space which was floored was\r\ncovered over with hurdles, and the hurdles plastered over with mortar.\r\nThe soldiers, covered overhead by the floor, on the right and left by\r\nthe wall, and in the front by the mantlets, carried whatever materials\r\nwere necessary for the building without danger: the business was soon\r\nfinished--the loss of their laborious work was soon repaired by the\r\ndexterity and fortitude of the soldiers. Gates for making sallies were\r\nleft in the wall in such places as they thought proper.\r\n\r\nXVI.--But when the enemy perceived that those works, which they had\r\nhoped could not be replaced without a great length of time, were put\r\ninto so thorough repair by a few days' labour and diligence, that there\r\nwas no room for perfidy or sallies, and that no means were left them by\r\nwhich they could either hurt the men by resistance or the works by fire,\r\nand when they found by former examples that their town could be\r\nsurrounded with a wall and turrets on every part by which it was\r\naccessible by land, in such a manner that they could not have room to\r\nstand on their own fortifications, because our works were built almost\r\non the top of their walls by our army, and darts could be thrown from\r\nour hands, and when they perceived that all advantage arising from their\r\nengines, on which they had built great hopes, was totally lost, and that\r\nthough they had an opportunity of fighting with us on equal terms from\r\nwalls and turrets, they could perceive that they were not equal to our\r\nmen in bravery, they had recourse to the same proposals of surrender as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nXVII.--In Further Spain, Marcus Varro, in the beginning of the\r\ndisturbances, when he heard of the circumstances which took place in\r\nItaly, being diffident of Pompey's success, used to speak in a very\r\nfriendly manner of Caesar. That though, being pre-engaged to Cneius\r\nPompey in quality of lieutenant, he was bound in honour to him, that,\r\nnevertheless, there existed a very intimate tie between him and Caesar;\r\nthat he was not ignorant of what was the duty of a lieutenant, who bore\r\nan office of trust; nor of his own strength, nor of the disposition of\r\nthe whole province to Caesar. These sentiments he constantly expressed\r\nin his ordinary conversation, and did not attach himself to either\r\nparty. But afterwards, when he found that Caesar was detained before\r\nMassilia, that the forces of Petreius had effected a junction with the\r\narmy of Afranius, that considerable reinforcements had come to their\r\nassistance, that there were great hopes and expectations, and heard that\r\nthe whole Hither province had entered into a confederacy, and of the\r\ndifficulties to which Caesar was reduced afterwards at Ilerda for want\r\nof provisions, and Afranius wrote to him a fuller and more exaggerated\r\naccount of these matters, he began to regulate his movements by those of\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\nXVIII.--He made levies throughout the province; and, having completed\r\nhis two legions, he added to them about thirty auxiliary cohorts: he\r\ncollected a large quantity of corn to send partly to the Massilians,\r\npartly to Afranius and Petreius. He commanded the inhabitants of Gades\r\nto build ten ships of war; besides, he took care that several others\r\nshould be built in Spain. He removed all the money and ornaments from\r\nthe temple of Hercules to the town of Gades, and sent six cohorts\r\nthither from the province to guard them, and gave the command of the\r\ntown of Gades to Caius Gallonius, a Roman knight, and friend of\r\nDomitius, who had come thither sent by Domitius to recover an estate for\r\nhim; and he deposited all the arms, both public and private, in\r\nGallonius's house. He himself [Varro] made severe harangues against\r\nCaesar. He often pronounced from his tribunal that Caesar had fought\r\nseveral unsuccessful battles, and that a great number of his men had\r\ndeserted to Afranius. That he had these accounts from undoubted\r\nmessengers, and authority on which he could rely. By these means he\r\nterrified the Roman citizens of that province, and obliged them to\r\npromise him for the service of the state one hundred and ninety thousand\r\nsesterces, twenty thousand pounds weight of silver, and a hundred and\r\ntwenty thousand bushels of wheat. He laid heavier burdens on those\r\nstates which he thought were friendly disposed to Caesar, and billeted\r\ntroops on them; he passed judgment against some private persons, and\r\ncondemned to confiscation the properties of those who had spoken or made\r\norations against the republic, and forced the whole province to take an\r\noath of allegiance to him and Pompey. Being informed of all that\r\nhappened in Hither Spain, he prepared for war. This was his plan of\r\noperations. He was to retire with his two legions to Gades, and to lay\r\nup all the shipping and provisions there. For he had been informed that\r\nthe whole province was inclined to favour Caesar's party. He thought\r\nthat the war might be easily protracted in an island, if he was provided\r\nwith corn and shipping. Caesar, although called back to Italy by many\r\nand important matters, yet had determined to leave no dregs of war\r\nbehind him in Spain, because he knew that Pompey had many dependants and\r\nclients in the Hither province.\r\n\r\nXIX.--Having therefore sent two legions into Further Spain under the\r\ncommand of Quintus Cassius, tribune of the people; he himself advances\r\nwith six hundred horse by forced marches, and issues a proclamation,\r\nappointing a day on which the magistrates and nobility of all the states\r\nshould attend him at Corduba. This proclamation being published through\r\nthe whole province, there was not a state that did not send a part of\r\ntheir senate to Corduba, at the appointed time; and not a Roman citizen\r\nof any note but appeared that day. At the same time the senate at\r\nCorduba shut the gates of their own accord against Varro, and posted\r\nguards and sentinels on the wall and in the turrets, and detained two\r\ncohorts (called Colonicae, which had come there accidentally), for the\r\ndefence of the town. About the same time the people of Carmona, which is\r\nby far the strongest state in the whole province, of themselves drove\r\nout of the town the cohorts, and shut the gates against them, although\r\nthree cohorts had been detached by Varro to garrison the citadel.\r\n\r\nXX.--But Varro was in greater haste on this account to reach Gades with\r\nhis legion as soon as possible, lest he should be stopped either on his\r\nmarch or on crossing over to the island. The affection of the province\r\nto Caesar proved so great and so favourable, that he received a letter\r\nfrom Gades, before he was far advanced on his march: that as soon as the\r\nnobility of Gades heard of Caesar's proclamation, they had combined with\r\nthe tribune of the cohorts, which were in garrison there, to drive\r\nGallonius out of the town, and to secure the city and island for Caesar.\r\nThat having agreed on the design they had sent notice to Gallonius, to\r\nquit Gades of his own accord whilst he could do it with safety; if he\r\ndid not, they would take measures for themselves; that for fear of this\r\nGallonius had been induced to quit the town. When this was known, one of\r\nVarro's two legions, which was called Vernacula, carried off the colours\r\nfrom Varro's camp, he himself standing by and looking on, and retired to\r\nHispalis, and took post in the market and public places without doing\r\nany injury, and the Roman citizens residing there approved so highly of\r\nthis act, that every one most earnestly offered to entertain them in\r\ntheir houses. When Varro, terrified at these things, having altered his\r\nroute, proposed going to Italica, he was informed by his friends that\r\nthe gates were shut against him. Then indeed, when intercepted from\r\nevery road, he sends word to Caesar that he was ready to deliver up the\r\nlegion which he commanded. He sends to him Sextus Caesar, and orders him\r\nto deliver it up to him. Varro, having delivered up the legion, went to\r\nCaesar to Corduba, and having laid before him the public accounts,\r\nhanded over to him most faithfully whatever money he had, and told him\r\nwhat quantity of corn and shipping he had, and where.\r\n\r\nXXI.--Caesar made a public oration at Corduba, in which he returned\r\nthanks to all severally: to the Roman citizens, because they had been\r\nzealous to keep the town in their own power; to the Spaniards, for\r\nhaving driven out the garrison; to the Gaditani, for having defeated the\r\nattempts of his enemies, and asserted their own liberty; to the Tribunes\r\nand Centurions who had gone there as a guard, for having by their valour\r\nconfirmed them in their purpose. He remitted the tax which the Roman\r\ncitizens had promised to Varro for the public use: he restored their\r\ngoods to those who he was informed had incurred that penalty by speaking\r\ntoo freely, having given public and private rewards to some: he filled\r\nthe rest with flattering hopes of his future intentions; and having\r\nstayed two days at Corduba, he set out for Gades: he ordered the money\r\nand ornaments which had been carried away from the temple of Hercules,\r\nand lodged in the houses of private persons, to be replaced in the\r\ntemple. He made Quintus Cassius governor of the province, and assigned\r\nhim four legions. He himself, with those ships which Marcus Varro had\r\nbuilt, and others which the Gaditani had built by Varro's orders,\r\narrived in a few days at Tarraco, where ambassadors from the greatest\r\npart of the nearer province waited his arrival. Having in the same\r\nmanner conferred marks of honour both publicly and privately on some\r\nstates, he left Tarraco, and went thence by land to Narbo, and thence to\r\nMassilia. There he was informed that a law was passed for creating a\r\ndictator, and that he had been nominated dictator by Marcus Lepidus the\r\npraetor.\r\n\r\nXXII.--The Massilians, wearied out by misfortunes of every sort, reduced\r\nto the lowest ebb for want of corn, conquered in two engagements at sea,\r\ndefeated in their frequent sallies, and struggling moreover with a fatal\r\npestilence, from their long confinement and change of victuals (for they\r\nall subsisted on old millet and damaged barley, which they had formerly\r\nprovided and laid up in the public stores against an emergency of this\r\nkind), their turret being demolished, a great part of their wall having\r\ngiven way, and despairing of any aid, either from the provinces or their\r\narmies, for these they had heard had fallen into Caesar's power,\r\nresolved to surrender now without dissimulation. But a few days before,\r\nLucius Domitius, having discovered the intention of the Massilians, and\r\nhaving procured three ships, two of which he gave up to his friends,\r\nwent on board the third himself, having got a brisk wind, put out to\r\nsea. Some ships, which by Brutus's orders were constantly cruising near\r\nthe port, having espied him, weighed anchor, and pursued him. But of\r\nthese, the ship on board of which he was, persevered itself, and\r\ncontinuing its flight, and by the aid of the wind got out of sight: the\r\nother two, affrighted by the approach of our galleys, put back again\r\ninto the harbour. The Massilians conveyed their arms and engines out of\r\nthe town, as they were ordered: brought their ships out of the port and\r\ndocks, and delivered up the money in their treasury. When these affairs\r\nwere despatched, Caesar, sparing the town more out of regard to their\r\nrenown and antiquity than to any claim they could lay to his favour,\r\nleft two legions in garrison there, sent the rest to Italy, and set out\r\nhimself for Rome.\r\n\r\nXXIII.--About the same time Caius Curio, having sailed from Sicily to\r\nAfrica, and from the first despising the forces of Publius Attius Varus,\r\ntransported only two of the four legions which he had received from\r\nCaesar, and five hundred horse, and having spent two days and three\r\nnights on the voyage, arrived at a place called Aquilaria, which is\r\nabout twenty-two miles distant from Clupea, and in the summer season has\r\na convenient harbour, and is enclosed by two projecting promontories.\r\nLucius Caesar, the son, who was waiting his arrival near Clupea with ten\r\nships which had been taken near Utica in a war with the pirates, and\r\nwhich Publius Attius had had repaired for this war, frightened at the\r\nnumber of our ships, fled the sea, and running his three-decked covered\r\ngalley on the nearest shore, left her there and made his escape by land\r\nto Adrumetum. Caius Considius Longus, with a garrison of one legion,\r\nguarded this town. The rest of Caesar's fleet, after his flight, retired\r\nto Adrumetum. Marcus Rufus, the quaestor, pursued him with twelve ships,\r\nwhich Curio had brought from Sicily as convoy to the merchantmen, and\r\nseeing a ship left on the shore, he brought her off by a towing rope,\r\nand returned with his fleet to Curio.\r\n\r\nXXIV.--Curio detached Marcus before with the fleet to Utica, and marched\r\nthither with his army. Having advanced two days, he came to the river\r\nBagrada, and there left Caius Caninius Rebilus, the lieutenant, with the\r\nlegions; and went forward himself with the horse to view the Cornelian\r\ncamp, because that was reckoned a very eligible position for encamping.\r\nIt is a straight ridge, projecting into the sea, steep and rough on both\r\nsides, but the ascent is more gentle on that part which lies opposite\r\nUtica. It is not more than a mile distant from Utica in a direct line.\r\nBut on this road there is a spring, to which the sea comes up, and\r\noverflows; an extensive morass is thereby formed; and if a person would\r\navoid it, he must make a circuit of six miles to reach the town.\r\n\r\nXXV.--Having examined this place, Curio got a view of Varus's camp,\r\njoining the wall and town, at the gate called Bellica, well fortified by\r\nits natural situation, on one side by the town itself, on the other by a\r\ntheatre which is before the town, the approaches to the town being\r\nrendered difficult and narrow by the very extensive out-buildings of\r\nthat structure. At the same time he observed the roads very full of\r\ncarriages and cattle which they were conveying from the country into the\r\ntown on the sudden alarm. He sent his cavalry after them to plunder them\r\nand get the spoil. And at the same time Varus had detached as a guard\r\nfor them six hundred Numidian horse, and four hundred foot, which king\r\nJuba had sent to Utica as auxiliaries a few days before. There was a\r\nfriendship subsisting between his [Juba's] father and Pompey, and a feud\r\nbetween him and Curio, because he, when a tribune of the people, had\r\nproposed a law, in which he endeavoured to make public property of the\r\nkingdom of Juba. The horse engaged; but the Numidians were not able to\r\nstand our first charge; but a hundred and twenty being killed, the rest\r\nretreated into their camp near the town. In the meantime, on the arrival\r\nof his men-of-war, Curio ordered proclamation to be made to the merchant\r\nships, which lay at anchor before Utica, in number about two hundred,\r\nthat he would treat as enemies all that did not set sail immediately for\r\nthe Cornelian camp. As soon as the proclamation was made, in an instant\r\nthey all weighed anchor and left Utica, and repaired to the place\r\ncommanded them. This circumstance furnished the army with plenty of\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nXXVI.--After these transactions, Curio returned to his camp at Bagrada;\r\nand by a general shout of the whole army was saluted imperator. The next\r\nday he led his army to Utica, and encamped near the town. Before the\r\nworks of the camp were finished, the horse upon guard brought him word\r\nthat a large supply of horse and foot sent by king Juba were on their\r\nmarch to Utica, and at the same time a cloud of dust was observed, and\r\nin a moment the front of the line was in sight. Curio, surprised at the\r\nsuddenness of the affair, sent on the horse to receive their first\r\ncharge, and detain them. He immediately called off his legions from the\r\nwork, and put them in battle array. The horse began the battle: and\r\nbefore the legions could be completely marshalled and take their ground,\r\nthe king's entire forces being thrown into disorder and confusion,\r\nbecause they had marched without any order, and were under no\r\napprehensions, betake themselves to flight: almost all the enemy's horse\r\nbeing safe, because they made a speedy retreat into the town along the\r\nshore, Caesar's soldiers slay a great number of their infantry.\r\n\r\nXXVII.--The next night two Marsian centurions, with twenty-two men\r\nbelonging to the companies, deserted from Curio's camp to Attius Varus.\r\nThey, whether they uttered the sentiments which they really entertained,\r\nor wished to gratify Varus (for what we wish we readily give credit to,\r\nand what we think ourselves, we hope is the opinion of other men),\r\nassured him, that the minds of the whole army were disaffected to Curio,\r\nthat it was very expedient that the armies should be brought in view of\r\neach other, and an opportunity of a conference be given. Induced by\r\ntheir opinion, Varus the next day led his troops out of the camp: Curio\r\ndid so in like manner, and with only one small valley between them, each\r\ndrew up his forces.\r\n\r\nXXVIII.--In Varus's army there was one Sextus Quintilius Varus who, as\r\nwe have mentioned before, was at Corfinium. When Caesar gave him his\r\nliberty, he went over to Africa; now, Curio had transported to Africa\r\nthose legions which Caesar had received under his command a short time\r\nbefore at Corfinium: so that the officers and companies were still the\r\nsame, excepting the change of a few centurions. Quintilius, making this\r\na pretext for addressing them, began to go round Curio's lines, and to\r\nentreat the soldiers \"not to lose all recollection of the oath which\r\nthey took first to Domitius and to him their quaestor, nor bear arms\r\nagainst those who had shared the same fortune, and endured the same\r\nhardships in a siege, nor fight for those by whom they had been\r\nopprobriously called deserters.\" To this he added a few words by way of\r\nencouragement, what they might expect from his own liberality, if they\r\nshould follow him and Attius. On the delivery of this speech, no\r\nintimation of their future conduct is given by Curio's army, and thus\r\nboth generals led back their troops to their camp.\r\n\r\nXXIX.--However, a great and general fear spread through Curio's camp,\r\nfor it is soon increased by the various discourses of men. For every one\r\nformed an opinion of his own; and to what he had heard from others,\r\nadded his own apprehensions. When this had spread from a single author\r\nto several persons, and was handed from one another, there appeared to\r\nbe many authors for such sentiments as these: [\"That it was a civil war;\r\nthat they were men; and therefore that it was lawful for them to act\r\nfreely, and follow which party they pleased.\" These were the legions\r\nwhich a short time before had belonged to the enemy; for the custom of\r\noffering free towns to those who joined the opposite party had changed\r\nCaesar's kindness. For the harshest expressions of the soldiers in\r\ngeneral did not proceed from the Marsi and Peligni, as those which\r\npassed in the tents the night before; and some of their fellow soldiers\r\nheard them with displeasure. Some additions were also made to them by\r\nthose who wished to be thought more zealous in their duty.]\r\n\r\nXXX.--For these reasons, having called a council, Curio began to\r\ndeliberate on the general welfare. There were some opinions, which\r\nadvised by all means an attempt to be made, and an attack on Varus's\r\ncamp; for when such sentiments prevailed among the soldiers, they\r\nthought idleness was improper. In short, they said, \"that it was better\r\nbravely to try the hazard of war in a battle, than to be deserted and\r\nsurrounded by their own troops, and forced to submit to the greatest\r\ncruelties.\" There were some who gave their opinion, that they ought to\r\nwithdraw at the third watch to the Cornelian camp; that by a longer\r\ninterval of time the soldiers might be brought to a proper way of\r\nthinking; and also, that if any misfortune should befall them, they\r\nmight have a safer and readier retreat to Sicily, from the great number\r\nof their ships.\r\n\r\nXXXI.--Curio, censuring both measures, said, \"that the one was as\r\ndeficient in spirit, as the other exceeded in it: that the latter\r\nadvised a shameful flight, and the former recommended us to engage at a\r\ngreat disadvantage. For on what, says he, can we rely that we can storm\r\na camp, fortified both by nature and art? Or, indeed, what advantage do\r\nwe gain if we give over the assault, after having suffered considerable\r\nloss; as if success did not acquire for a general the affection of his\r\narmy, and misfortune their hatred? But what does a change of camp imply\r\nbut a shameful flight, and universal despair, and the alienation of the\r\narmy? For neither ought the obedient to suspect that they are\r\ndistrusted, nor the insolent to know that we fear them; because our\r\nfears augment the licentiousness of the latter, and diminish the zeal of\r\nthe former. But if, says he, we were convinced of the truth of the\r\nreports of the disaffection of the army (which I indeed am confident are\r\neither altogether groundless, or at least less than they are supposed to\r\nbe), how much better to conceal and hide our suspicions of it, than by\r\nour conduct confirm it? Ought not the defects of an army to be as\r\ncarefully concealed as the wounds in our bodies, lest we should increase\r\nthe enemy's hopes? but they moreover advise us to set out at midnight,\r\nin order, I suppose, that those who attempt to do wrong may have a\r\nfairer opportunity; for conduct of this kind is restrained either by\r\nshame or fear, to the display of which the night is most adverse.\r\nWherefore, I am neither so rash as to give my opinion that we ought to\r\nattack their camp without hopes of succeeding; nor so influenced by fear\r\nas to despond: and I imagine that every expedient ought first to be\r\ntried; and I am in a great degree confident that I shall form the same\r\nopinion as yourselves on this matter.\"\r\n\r\nXXXII.--Having broken up the council he called the soldiers together,\r\nand reminded them \"what advantage Caesar had derived from their zeal at\r\nCorfinium; how by their good offices and influence he had brought over a\r\ngreat part of Italy to his interest. For, says he, all the municipal\r\ntowns afterwards imitated you and your conduct; nor was it without\r\nreason that Caesar judged so favourably, and the enemy so harshly of\r\nyou. For Pompey, though beaten in no engagement, yet was obliged to\r\nshift his ground, and leave Italy, from the precedent established by\r\nyour conduct. Caesar committed me, whom he considered his dearest\r\nfriend, and the provinces of Sicily and Africa, without which he was not\r\nable to protect Rome or Italy, to your protection. There are some here\r\npresent who encourage you to revolt from us; for what can they wish for\r\nmore, than at once to ruin us, and to involve you in a heinous crime? or\r\nwhat baser opinions could they in their resentment entertain of you,\r\nthan that you would betray those who acknowledged themselves indebted to\r\nyou for everything, and put yourselves in the power of those who think\r\nthey have been ruined by you? Have you not heard of Caesar's exploits in\r\nSpain? that he routed two armies, conquered two generals, recovered two\r\nprovinces, and effected all this within forty days after he came in\r\nsight of the enemy? Can those who were not able to stand against him\r\nwhilst they were uninjured resist him when they are ruined? Will you,\r\nwho took part with Caesar whilst victory was uncertain, take part with\r\nthe conquered enemy when the fortune of the war is decided, and when you\r\nought to reap the reward of your services? For they say that they have\r\nbeen deserted and betrayed by you, and remind you of a former oath. But\r\ndid you desert Lucius Domitius, or did Lucius Domitius desert you? Did\r\nhe not, when you were ready to submit to the greatest difficulties, cast\r\nyou off? Did he not, without your privacy, endeavour to effect his own\r\nescape? When you were betrayed by him, were you not preserved by\r\nCaesar's generosity? And how could he think you bound by your oath to\r\nhim, when, after having thrown up the ensigns of power, and abdicated\r\nhis government, he became a private person, and a captive in another's\r\npower? A new obligation is left upon you, that you should disregard the\r\noath, by which you are at present bound; and have respect only to that\r\nwhich was invalidated by the surrender of your general, and his\r\ndiminution of rank. But I suppose, although you are pleased with Caesar,\r\nyou are offended with me; however I shall not boast of my services to\r\nyou, which still are inferior to my own wishes or your expectations.\r\nBut, however, soldiers have ever looked for the rewards of labour at the\r\nconclusion of a war; and what the issue of it is likely to be, not even\r\nyou can doubt. But why should I omit to mention my own diligence and\r\ngood fortune, and to what a happy crisis affairs are now arrived? Are\r\nyou sorry that I transported the army safe and entire, without the loss\r\nof a single ship? That on my arrival, in the very first attack, I routed\r\nthe enemy's fleet? That twice in two days I defeated the enemy's horse?\r\nThat I carried out of the very harbour and bay, two hundred of the\r\nenemy's victuallers, and reduced them to that situation that they can\r\nreceive no supplies either by land or sea? Will you divorce yourselves\r\nfrom this fortune and these generals; and prefer the disgrace of\r\nCorfinium, the defeat of Italy, the surrender of both Spains, and the\r\nprestige of the African war? I, for my part, wished to be called a\r\nsoldier of Caesar's; you honoured me with the title of Imperator. If you\r\nrepent your bounty, I give it back to you; restore to me my former name\r\nthat you may not appear to have conferred the honour on me as a\r\nreproach.\"\r\n\r\nXXXIII.--The soldiers, being affected by this oration, frequently\r\nattempted to interrupt him whilst he was speaking, so that they appeared\r\nto bear with excessive anguish the suspicion of treachery, and when he\r\nwas leaving the assembly they unanimously besought him to be of good\r\nspirits, and not hesitate to engage the enemy and put their fidelity and\r\ncourage to a trial. As the wishes and opinions of all were changed by\r\nthis act, Curio, with the general consent, determined, whenever\r\nopportunity offered, to hazard a battle. The next day he led out his\r\nforces and ranged them in order of battle on the same ground where they\r\nhad been posted the preceding day; nor did Attius Varus hesitate to draw\r\nout his men, that, if any occasion should offer, either to tamper with\r\nour men or to engage on equal terms, he might not miss the opportunity.\r\n\r\nXXXIV.-There lay between the two armies a valley, as already mentioned,\r\nnot very deep, but of a difficult and steep ascent. Each was waiting\r\ntill the enemy's forces should attempt to pass it, that they might\r\nengage with the advantage of the ground. At the same time, on the left\r\nwing, the entire cavalry of Publius Attius, and several light-armed\r\ninfantry intermixed with them, were perceived descending into the\r\nvalley. Against them Curio detached his cavalry and two cohorts of the\r\nMarrucini, whose first charge the enemy's horse were unable to stand,\r\nbut, setting spurs to their horses, fled back to their friends: the\r\nlight-infantry being deserted by those who had come out along with them,\r\nwere surrounded and cut to pieces by our men. Varus's whole army, facing\r\nthat way, saw their men flee and cut down. Upon which Rebilus, one of\r\nCaesar's lieutenants, whom Curio had brought with him from Sicily\r\nknowing that he had great experience in military matters, cried out,\r\n\"You see the enemy are daunted, Curio! why do you hesitate to take\r\nadvantage of the opportunity?\" Curio, having merely \"expressed this,\r\nthat the soldiers should keep in mind the professions which they had\r\nmade to him the day before,\" then ordered them to follow him, and ran\r\nfar before them all. The valley was so difficult of ascent that the\r\nforemost men could not struggle up it unless assisted by those behind.\r\nBut the minds of Attius's soldiers being prepossessed with fear and the\r\nflight and slaughter of their men, never thought of opposing us; and\r\nthey all imagined that they were already surrounded by our horse, and,\r\ntherefore, before a dart could be thrown or our men come near them,\r\nVarus's whole army turned their backs and retreated to their camp.\r\n\r\nXXXV.-In this flight one Fabius, a Pelignian and common soldier in\r\nCurio's army, pursuing the enemy's rear, with a loud voice shouted to\r\nVarus by his name, and often called him, so that he seemed to be one of\r\nhis soldiers, who wished to speak to him and give him advice. When\r\nVarus, after being repeatedly called, stopped and looked at him, and\r\ninquired who he was and what he wanted, he made a blow with his sword at\r\nhis naked shoulder and was very near killing Varus, but he escaped the\r\ndanger by raising his shield to ward off the blow. Fabius was surrounded\r\nby the soldiers near him and cut to pieces; and by the multitude and\r\ncrowds of those that fled, the gates of the camps were thronged and the\r\npassage stopped, and a greater number perished in that place without a\r\nstroke than in the battle and flight. Nor were we far from driving them\r\nfrom this camp; and some of them ran straightway to the town without\r\nhalting. But both the nature of the ground and the strength of the\r\nfortifications prevented our access to the camp; for Curio's soldiers,\r\nmarching out to battle, were without those things which were requisite\r\nfor storming a camp. Curio, therefore, led his army back to the camp,\r\nwith all his troops safe except Fabius. Of the enemy about six hundred\r\nwere killed and a thousand wounded, all of whom, after Curio's return,\r\nand several more under pretext of their wounds, but in fact through\r\nfear, withdrew from the camp into the town, which Varus perceiving and\r\nknowing the terror of his army, leaving a trumpeter in his camp and a\r\nfew tents for show, at the third watch led back his army quietly into\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\nXXXVI.--The next day Curio resolved to besiege Utica, and to draw lines\r\nabout it. In the town there was a multitude of people, ignorant of war,\r\nowing to the length of the peace; some of them Uticans, very well\r\ninclined to Caesar, for his favours to them; the Roman population was\r\ncomposed of persons differing widely in their sentiments. The terror\r\noccasioned by former battles was very great; and therefore they openly\r\ntalked of surrendering, and argued with Attius that he should not suffer\r\nthe fortune of them all to be ruined by his obstinacy. Whilst these\r\nthings were in agitation, couriers, who had been sent forward, arrived\r\nfrom king Juba, with the intelligence that he was on his march, with\r\nconsiderable forces, and encouraged them to protect and defend their\r\ncity, a circumstance which greatly comforted their desponding hearts.\r\n\r\nXXXVII.--The same intelligence was brought to Curio; but for some time\r\nhe could not give credit to it, because he had so great confidence in\r\nhis own good fortune. And at this time Caesar's success in Spain was\r\nannounced in Africa by messages and letters. Being elated by all these\r\nthings, he imagined that the king would not dare to attempt anything\r\nagainst him. But when he found out, from undoubted authority, that his\r\nforces were less than twenty miles distant from Utica, abandoning his\r\nworks, he retired to the Cornelian camp. Here he began to lay in corn\r\nand wood, and to fortify his camp, and immediately despatched orders to\r\nSicily, that his two legions and the remainder of his cavalry should be\r\nsent to him. His camp was well adapted for protracting a war, from the\r\nnature and strength of the situation, from its proximity to the sea, and\r\nthe abundance of water and salt, of which a great quantity had been\r\nstored up from the neighbouring salt-pits. Timber could not fail him\r\nfrom the number of trees, nor corn, with which the lands abounded.\r\nWherefore, with the general consent, Curio determined to wait for the\r\nrest of his forces, and protract the war.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII.--This plan being settled, and his conduct approved of, he is\r\ninformed by some deserters from the town that Juba had stayed behind in\r\nhis own kingdom, being called home by a neighbouring war, and a dispute\r\nwith the people of Leptis; and that Sabura, his commander-in-chief, who\r\nhad been sent with a small force, was drawing near to Utica. Curio\r\nrashly believing this information, altered his design, and resolved to\r\nhazard a battle. His youth, his spirits, his former good fortune and\r\nconfidence of success, contributed much to confirm this resolution.\r\nInduced by these motives, early in the night he sent all his cavalry to\r\nthe enemy's camp near the river Bagrada, of which Sabura, of whom we\r\nhave already spoken, was the commander. But the king was coming after\r\nthem with all his forces, and was posted at a distance of six miles\r\nbehind Sabura. The horse that were sent perform their march that night,\r\nand attack the enemy unawares and unexpectedly; for the Numidians, after\r\nthe usual barbarous custom, encamped here and there without any\r\nregularity. The cavalry having attacked them, when sunk in sleep and\r\ndispersed, killed a great number of them; many were frightened and ran\r\naway. After which the horse returned to Curio, and brought some\r\nprisoners with them.\r\n\r\nXXXIX.--Curio had set out at the fourth watch with all his forces,\r\nexcept five cohorts which he left to guard the camp. Having advanced six\r\nmiles, he met the horse, heard what had happened, and inquired from the\r\ncaptives who commanded the camp at Bagrada. They replied Sabura. Through\r\neagerness to perform his journey, he neglected to make further\r\ninquiries, but looking back to the company next him, \"Don't you see,\r\nsoldiers,\" says he, \"that the answer of the prisoners corresponds with\r\nthe account of the deserters, that the king is not with him, and that he\r\nsent only a small force which was not able to withstand a few horse?\r\nHasten then to spoil, to glory; that we may now begin to think of\r\nrewarding you, and returning you thanks.\" The achievements of the horse\r\nwere great in themselves, especially if their small number be compared\r\nwith the vast host of Numidians. However, the account was enlarged by\r\nthemselves, as men are naturally inclined to boast of their own merit.\r\nBesides, many spoils were produced; the men and horses that were taken\r\nwere brought into their sight, that they might imagine that every moment\r\nof time which intervened was a delay to their conquest. By this means\r\nthe hopes of Curio were seconded by the ardour of the soldiers. He\r\nordered the horse to follow him, and hastened his march, that he might\r\nattack them as soon as possible, while in consternation after their\r\nflight. But the horse, fatigued by the expedition of the preceding\r\nnight, were not able to keep up with him, but fell behind in different\r\nplaces. Even this did not abate Curio's hopes.\r\n\r\nXL.--Juba, being informed by Sabura of the battle in the night, sent to\r\nhis relief two thousand Spanish and Gallic horse, which he was\r\naccustomed to keep near him to guard his person, and that part of his\r\ninfantry on which he had the greatest dependence, and he himself\r\nfollowed slowly after with the rest of his forces and forty elephants,\r\nsuspecting that as Curio had sent his horse before, he himself would\r\nfollow them. Sabura drew up his army, both horse and foot, and commanded\r\nthem to give way gradually and retreat through the pretence of fear;\r\nthat when it was necessary he would give them the signal for battle, and\r\nsuch orders as he found circumstances required. Curio, as his idea of\r\ntheir present behaviour was calculated to confirm his former hopes,\r\nimagined that the enemy were running away, and led his army from the\r\nrising grounds down to the plain.\r\n\r\nXLI.--And when he had advanced from this place about sixteen miles, his\r\narmy being exhausted with the fatigue, he halted. Sabura gave his men\r\nthe signal, marshalled his army, and began to go around his ranks and\r\nencourage them. But he made use of the foot only for show; and sent the\r\nhorse to the charge: Curio was not deficient in skill, and encouraged\r\nhis men to rest all their hopes in their valour. Neither were the\r\nsoldiers, though wearied, nor the horse, though few and exhausted with\r\nfatigue, deficient in ardour to engage, and courage: but the latter were\r\nin number but two hundred: the rest had dropped behind on the march.\r\nWherever they charged they forced the enemy to give ground, but they\r\nwere not able to pursue them far when they fled, or to press their\r\nhorses too severely. Besides, the enemy's cavalry began to surround us\r\non both wings and to trample down our rear. When any cohorts ran forward\r\nout of the line, the Numidians, being fresh, by their speed avoided our\r\ncharge, and surrounded ours when they attempted to return to their post,\r\nand cut them off from the main body. So that it did not appear safe\r\neither to keep their ground and maintain their ranks, or to issue from\r\nthe line, and run the risk. The enemy's troops were frequently\r\nreinforced by assistance sent from Juba; strength began to fail our men\r\nthrough fatigue; and those who had been wounded could neither quit the\r\nfield nor retire to a place of safety, because the whole field was\r\nsurrounded by the enemy's cavalry. Therefore, despairing of their own\r\nsafety, as men usually do in the last moment of their lives, they either\r\nlamented their unhappy deaths, or recommended their parents to the\r\nsurvivors, if fortune should save any from the impending danger. All\r\nwere full of fear and grief.\r\n\r\nXLII.--When Curio perceived that in the general consternation neither\r\nhis exhortations nor entreaties were attended to, imagining that the\r\nonly hope of escaping in their deplorable situation was to gain the\r\nnearest hills, he ordered the colours to be borne that way. But a party\r\nof horse, that had been sent by Sabura, had already got possession of\r\nthem. Now indeed our men were reduced to extreme despair: and some of\r\nthem were killed by the cavalry in attempting to escape: some fell to\r\nthe ground unhurt. Cneius Domitius, commander of the cavalry, standing\r\nround Curio with a small party of horse, urged Curio to endeavour to\r\nescape by flight, and to hasten to his camp; and assured him that he\r\nwould not forsake him. But Curio declared that he would never more\r\nappear in Caesar's sight, after losing the army which had been committed\r\nby Caesar to his charge, and accordingly fought till he was killed. Very\r\nfew of the horse escaped from that battle, but those who had stayed\r\nbehind to refresh their horses having perceived at a distance the defeat\r\nof the whole army, retired in safety to their camp.\r\n\r\nXLIII.--The soldiers were all killed to a man. Marcus Rufus, the\r\nquaestor, who was left behind in the camp by Curio, having got\r\nintelligence of these things, encouraged his men not to be disheartened.\r\nThey beg and entreat to be transported to Sicily. He consented, and\r\nordered the masters of the ships to have all the boats brought close to\r\nthe shore early in the evening. But so great was the terror in general\r\nthat some said that Juba's forces were marching up, others that Varus\r\nwas hastening with his legions, and that they already saw the dust\r\nraised by their coming; of which not one circumstance had happened:\r\nothers suspected that the enemy's fleet would immediately be upon them.\r\nTherefore, in the general consternation, every man consulted his own\r\nsafety. Those who were on board of the fleet, were in a hurry to set\r\nsail, and their flight hastened the masters of the ships of burden. A\r\nfew small fishing boats attended their duty and his orders. But as the\r\nshores were crowded, so great was the struggle to determine who of such\r\na vast number should first get on board, that some of the vessels sank\r\nwith the weight of the multitude, and the fears of the rest delayed them\r\nfrom coming to the shore.\r\n\r\nXLIV.--From which circumstances it happened that a few foot and aged\r\nmen, that could prevail either through interest or pity, or who were\r\nable to swim to the ships, were taken on board, and landed safe in\r\nSicily. The rest of the troops sent their centurions as deputies to\r\nVarus at night, and surrendered themselves to him. But Juba, the next\r\nday having spied their cohorts before the town, claimed them as his\r\nbooty, and ordered a great part of them to be put to the sword; a few he\r\nselected and sent home to his own realm. Although Varus complained that\r\nhis honour was insulted by Juba, yet he dare not oppose him: Juba rode\r\non horseback into the town, attended by several senators, amongst whom\r\nwere Servius Sulpicius and Licinius Damasippus, and in a few days\r\narranged and ordered what he would have done in Utica, and in a few days\r\nmore returned to his own kingdom, with all his forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\nI.--Julius Caesar, holding the election as dictator, was himself\r\nappointed consul with Publius Servilius; for this was the year in which\r\nit was permitted by the laws that he should be chosen consul. This\r\nbusiness being ended, as credit was beginning to fail in Italy, and the\r\ndebts could not be paid, he determined that arbitrators should be\r\nappointed: and that they should make an estimate of the possessions and\r\nproperties [of the debtors], how much they were worth before the war,\r\nand that they should be handed over in payment to the creditors. This he\r\nthought the most likely method to remove and abate the apprehension of\r\nan abolition of debt, the usual consequence of civil wars and\r\ndissensions, and to support the credit of the debtors. He likewise\r\nrestored to their former condition (the praetors and tribunes first\r\nsubmitting the question to the people) some persons condemned for\r\nbribery at the elections, by virtue of Pompey's law, at the time when\r\nPompey kept his legions quartered in the city (these trials were\r\nfinished in a single day, one judge hearing the merits, and another\r\npronouncing the sentences), because they had offered their service to\r\nhim in the beginning of the civil war, if he chose to accept them;\r\nsetting the same value on them as if he had accepted them, because they\r\nhad put themselves in his power. For he had determined that they ought\r\nto be restored, rather by the judgment of the people, than appear\r\nadmitted to it by his bounty: that he might neither appear ungrateful in\r\nrepaying an obligation, nor arrogant in depriving the people of their\r\nprerogative of exercising this bounty.\r\n\r\nII.--In accomplishing these things, and celebrating the Latin festival,\r\nand holding all the elections, he spent eleven days; and having resigned\r\nthe dictatorship, set out from the city, and went to Brundisium, where\r\nhe had ordered twelve legions and all his cavalry to meet him. But he\r\nscarcely found as many ships as would be sufficient to transport fifteen\r\nthousand legionary soldiers and five hundred horse. This [the scarcity\r\nof shipping] was the only thing that prevented Caesar from putting a\r\nspeedy conclusion to the war. And even these troops embarked very short\r\nof their number, because several had fallen in so many wars in Gaul, and\r\nthe long march from Spain had lessened their number very much, and a\r\nsevere autumn in Apulia and the district about Brundisium, after the\r\nvery wholesome countries of Spain and Gaul, had impaired the health of\r\nthe whole army.\r\n\r\nIII.--Pompey having got a year's respite to provide forces, during which\r\nhe was not engaged in war, nor employed by an enemy, had collected a\r\nnumerous fleet from Asia, and the Cyclades, from Corcyra, Athens,\r\nPontus, Bithynia, Syria, Cilicia, Phoenicia, and Egypt, and had given\r\ndirections that a great number should be built in every other place. He\r\nhad exacted a large sum of money from Asia, Syria, and all the kings,\r\ndynasts, tetrarchs, and free states of Achaia; and had obliged the\r\ncorporations of those provinces, of which he himself had the government,\r\nto count down to him a large sum.\r\n\r\nIV.--He had made up nine legions of Roman citizens; five from Italy,\r\nwhich he had brought with him; one veteran legion from Sicily, which\r\nbeing composed of two, he called the Gemella; one from Crete and\r\nMacedonia, of veterans who had been discharged by their former generals,\r\nand had settled in those provinces; two from Asia, which had been levied\r\nby the activity of Lentulus. Besides he had distributed among his\r\nlegions a considerable number, by way of recruits, from Thessaly,\r\nBoeotia, Achaia, and Epirus: with his legions he also intermixed the\r\nsoldiers taken from Caius Antonius. Besides these, he expected two\r\nlegions from Syria, with Scipio; from Crete, Lacedaemon, Pontus, Syria,\r\nand other states, he got about three thousand archers, six cohorts of\r\nslingers, two thousand mercenary soldiers, and seven thousand horse; six\r\nhundred of which, Deiotarus had brought from Gaul; Ariobarzanes, five\r\nhundred from Cappadocia. Cotus had given him about the same number from\r\nThrace, and had sent his son Sadalis with them. From Macedonia there\r\nwere two hundred, of extraordinary valour, commanded by Rascipolis; five\r\nhundred Gauls and Germans; Gabinius's troops from Alexandria, whom Aulus\r\nGabinius had left with king Ptolemy, to guard his person. Pompey, the\r\nson, had brought in his fleet eight hundred, whom he had raised among\r\nhis own and his shepherds' slaves. Tarcundarius, Castor and Donilaus had\r\ngiven three hundred from Gallograecia: one of these came himself, the\r\nother sent his son. Two hundred were sent from Syria by Comagenus\r\nAntiochus, whom Pompey rewarded amply. The most of them were archers. To\r\nthese were added Dardanians, and Bessians, some of them mercenaries;\r\nothers procured by power and influence: also, Macedonians, Thessalians,\r\nand troops from other nations and states, which completed the number\r\nwhich we mentioned before.\r\n\r\nV.--He had laid in vast quantities of corn from Thessaly, Asia, Egypt,\r\nCrete, Cyrene, and other countries. He had resolved to fix his winter\r\nquarters at Dyrrachium, Apollonia, and the other sea-ports, to hinder\r\nCaesar from passing the sea: and for this purpose had stationed his\r\nfleet along the sea-coast. The Egyptian fleet was commanded by Pompey,\r\nthe son: the Asiatic, by Decimus Laelius, and Caius Triarius: the\r\nSyrian, by Caius Cassius: the Rhodian, by Caius Marcellus, in\r\nconjunction with Caius Coponius; and the Liburnian, and Achaian, by\r\nScribonius Libo, and Marcus Octavius. But Marcus Bibulus was appointed\r\ncommander-in-chief of the whole maritime department, and regulated every\r\nmatter. The chief direction rested upon him.\r\n\r\nVI.--When Caesar came to Brundisium, he made a speech to the soldiers:\r\n\"That since they were now almost arrived at the termination of their\r\ntoils and dangers, they should patiently submit to leave their slaves\r\nand baggage in Italy, and to embark without luggage, that a greater\r\nnumber of men might be put on board: that they might expect everything\r\nfrom victory and his liberality.\" They cried out with one voice, \"he\r\nmight give what orders he pleased, that they would cheerfully fulfil\r\nthem.\" He accordingly set sail the fourth day of January, with seven\r\nlegions on board, as already remarked. The next day he reached land,\r\nbetween the Ceraunian rocks and other dangerous places; meeting with a\r\nsafe road for his shipping to ride in, and dreading all other ports\r\nwhich he imagined were in possession of the enemy, he landed his men at\r\na place called Pharsalus, without the loss of a single vessel.\r\n\r\nVII.--Lucretius Vespillo and Minutius Rufus were at Oricum, with\r\neighteen Asiatic ships, which were given into their charge by the orders\r\nof Decimus Laelius: Marcus Bibulus at Corcyra, with a hundred and ten\r\nships. But they had not the confidence to dare to move out of the\r\nharbour; though Caesar had brought only twelve ships as a convoy, only\r\nfour of which had decks; nor did Bibulus, his fleet being disordered and\r\nhis seamen dispersed, come up in time: for Caesar was seen at the\r\ncontinent before any account whatsoever of his approach had reached\r\nthose regions.\r\n\r\nVIII.--Caesar, having landed his soldiers, sent back his ships the same\r\nnight to Brundisium, to transport the rest of his legions and cavalry.\r\nThe charge of this business was committed to lieutenant Fufius Kalenus,\r\nwith orders to be expeditious in transporting the legions. But the ships\r\nhaving put to sea too late, and not having taken advantage of the night\r\nbreeze, fell a sacrifice on their return. For Bibulus, at Corcyra, being\r\ninformed of Caesar's approach, hoped to fall in with some part of our\r\nships, with their cargoes, but found them empty; and having taken about\r\nthirty, vented on them his rage at his own remissness, and set them all\r\non fire: and, with the same flames, he destroyed the mariners and\r\nmasters of the vessels, hoping by the severity of the punishment to\r\ndeter the rest. Having accomplished this affair, he filled all the\r\nharbours and shores from Salona to Oricum with his fleets. Having\r\ndisposed his guard with great care, he lay on board himself in the depth\r\nof winter, declining no fatigue or duty, and not waiting for\r\nreinforcements, in hopes that he might come within Caesar's reach.\r\n\r\nIX.--But after the departure of the Liburnian fleet, Marcus Octavius\r\nsailed from Illyricum with what ships he had to Salona; and having\r\nspirited up the Dalmatians, and other barbarous nations, he drew Issa\r\noff from its connection with Caesar; but not being able to prevail with\r\nthe council of Salona, either by promises or menaces, he resolved to\r\nstorm the town. But it was well fortified by its natural situation, and\r\na hill. The Roman citizens built wooden towers, the better to secure it;\r\nbut when they were unable to resist, on account of the smallness of\r\ntheir numbers, being weakened by several wounds, they stooped to the\r\nlast resource, and set at liberty all the slaves old enough to bear\r\narms; and cutting the hair off the women's heads, made ropes for their\r\nengines. Octavius, being informed of their determination, surrounded the\r\ntown with five encampments, and began to press them at once with a siege\r\nand storm. They were determined to endure every hardship, and their\r\ngreatest distress was the want of corn. They, therefore, sent deputies\r\nto Caesar, and begged a supply from him; all other inconveniences they\r\nbore by their own resources, as well as they could: and after a long\r\ninterval, when the length of the siege had made Octavius's troops more\r\nremiss than usual, having got an opportunity at noon, when the enemy\r\nwere dispersed, they disposed their wives and children on the walls, to\r\nkeep up the appearance of their usual attention; and forming themselves\r\ninto one body, with the slaves whom they had lately enfranchised, they\r\nmade an attack on Octavius's nearest camp, and having forced that,\r\nattacked the second with the same fury; and then the third and the\r\nfourth, and then the other, and beat them from them all: and having\r\nkilled a great number, obliged the rest and Octavius himself to fly for\r\nrefuge to their ships. This put an end to the blockade. Winter was now\r\napproaching, and Octavius, despairing of capturing the town, after\r\nsustaining such considerable losses, withdrew to Pompey, to Dyrrachium.\r\n\r\nX.--We have mentioned that Vibullius Rufus, an officer of Pompey's, had\r\nfallen twice into Caesar's power; first at Corfinium, and afterwards in\r\nSpain. Caesar thought him a proper person, on account of his favours\r\nconferred on him, to send with proposals to Pompey: and he knew that he\r\nhad an influence over Pompey. This was the substance of his proposals:\r\n\"That it was the duty of both, to put an end to their obstinacy, and\r\nforbear hostilities, and not tempt fortune any further; that sufficient\r\nloss had been suffered on both sides, to serve as a lesson and\r\ninstruction to them, to render them apprehensive of future calamities,\r\nby Pompey, in having been driven out of Italy, and having lost Sicily,\r\nSardinia, and the two Spains, and one hundred and thirty cohorts of\r\nRoman citizens, in Italy and Spain: by himself, in the death of Curio,\r\nand the loss of so great an army in Africa, and the surrender of his\r\nsoldiers in Corcyra. Wherefore, they should have pity on themselves, and\r\nthe republic: for, from their own misfortunes, they had sufficient\r\nexperience of what fortune can effect in war. That this was the only\r\ntime to treat of peace; when each had confidence in his own strength,\r\nand both seemed on an equal footing. Since, if fortune showed ever so\r\nlittle favour to either, he who thought himself superior, would not\r\nsubmit to terms of accommodation; nor would he be content with an equal\r\ndivision, when he might expect to obtain the whole. That, as they could\r\nnot agree before, the terms of peace ought to be submitted to the senate\r\nand people in Rome. That in the meantime, it ought to content the\r\nrepublic and themselves, if they both immediately took oath in a public\r\nassembly, that they would disband their forces within the three\r\nfollowing days. That having divested themselves of the arms and\r\nauxiliaries, on which they placed their present confidence, they must\r\nboth of necessity acquiesce in the decision of the people and senate. To\r\ngive Pompey the fuller assurance of his intentions, he would dismiss all\r\nhis forces on land, even his garrisons.\r\n\r\nXI.--Vibullius, having received this commission from Caesar, thought it\r\nno less necessary to give Pompey notice of Caesar's sudden approach,\r\nthat he might adopt such plans as the circumstance required, than to\r\ninform him of Caesar's message; and therefore continuing his journey by\r\nnight as well as by day, and taking fresh horses for despatch, he posted\r\naway to Pompey, to inform him that Caesar was marching towards him with\r\nall his forces. Pompey was at this time in Candavia, and was on his\r\nmarch from Macedonia to his winter quarters in Apollonia and Dyrrachium;\r\nbut surprised at the unexpected news, he determined to go to Apollonia\r\nby speedy marches, to prevent Caesar from becoming master of all the\r\nmaritime states. But as soon as Caesar had landed his troops, he set off\r\nthe same day for Oricum: when he arrived there, Lucius Torquatus, who\r\nwas governor of the town by Pompey's appointment, and had a garrison of\r\nParthinians in it, endeavoured to shut the gates and defend the town,\r\nand ordered the Greeks to man the walls, and to take arms. But as they\r\nrefused to fight against the power of the Roman people, and as the\r\ncitizens made a spontaneous attempt to admit Caesar, despairing of any\r\nassistance, he threw open the gates, and surrendered himself and the\r\ntown to Caesar, and was preserved safe from injury by him.\r\n\r\nXII.--Having taken Oricum, Caesar marched without making any delay to\r\nApollonia. Staberius the governor, hearing of his approach, began to\r\nbring water into the citadel, and to fortify it, and to demand hostages\r\nof the town's people. But they refuse to give any, or to shut their\r\ngates against the consul, or to take upon them to judge contrary to what\r\nall Italy and the Roman people had judged. As soon as he knew their\r\ninclinations, he made his escape privately. The inhabitants of Apollonia\r\nsent ambassadors to Caesar, and gave him admission into their town.\r\nTheir example was followed by the inhabitants of Bullis, Amantia, and\r\nthe other neighbouring states, and all Epirus: and they sent ambassadors\r\nto Caesar, and promised to obey his commands.\r\n\r\nXIII.--But Pompey having received information of the transactions at\r\nOricum and Apollonia, began to be alarmed for Dyrrachium, and\r\nendeavoured to reach it, marching day and night. As soon as it was said\r\nthat Caesar was approaching, such a panic fell upon Pompey's army,\r\nbecause in his haste he had made no distinction between night and day,\r\nand had marched without intermission, that they almost every man\r\ndeserted their colours in Epirus and the neighbouring countries; several\r\nthrew down their arms, and their march had the appearance of a flight.\r\nBut when Pompey had halted near Dyrrachium, and had given orders for\r\nmeasuring out the ground for his camp, his army even yet continuing in\r\ntheir fright, Labienus first stepped forward and swore that he would\r\nnever desert him, and would share whatever fate fortune should assign to\r\nhim. The other lieutenants took the same oath, and the tribunes and\r\ncenturions followed their example: and the whole army swore in like\r\nmanner. Caesar, finding the road to Dyrrachium already in the possession\r\nof Pompey, was in no great haste, but encamped by the river Apsus, in\r\nthe territory of Apollonia, that the states which had deserved his\r\nsupport might be certain of protection from his out-guards and forts;\r\nand there he resolved to wait the arrival of his other legions from\r\nItaly, and to winter in tents. Pompey did the same; and pitching his\r\ncamp on the other side of the river Apsus, collected there all his\r\ntroops and auxiliaries.\r\n\r\nXIV.--Kalenus, having put the legions and cavalry on board at\r\nBrundisium, as Caesar had directed him, as far as the number of his\r\nships allowed, weighed anchor: and having sailed a little distance from\r\nport, received a letter from Caesar, in which he was informed, that all\r\nthe ports and the whole shore was occupied by the enemy's fleet: on\r\nreceiving this information he returned into the harbour, and recalled\r\nall the vessels. One of them, which continued the voyage and did not\r\nobey Kalenus's command, because it carried no troops, but was private\r\nproperty, bore away for Oricum, and was taken by Bibulus, who spared\r\nneither slaves nor free men, nor even children; but put all to the\r\nsword. Thus the safety of the whole army depended on a very short space\r\nof time and a great casualty.\r\n\r\nXV.--Bibulus, as has been observed before, lay with his fleet near\r\nOricum, and as he debarred Caesar of the liberty of the sea and\r\nharbours, so he was deprived of all intercourse with the country by\r\nland; for the whole shore was occupied by parties disposed in different\r\nplaces by Caesar. And he was not allowed to get either wood or water, or\r\neven anchor near the land. He was reduced to great difficulties, and\r\ndistressed with extreme scarcity of every necessary; insomuch that he\r\nwas obliged to bring, in transports from Corcyra, not only provisions,\r\nbut even wood and water; and it once happened that, meeting with violent\r\nstorms, they were forced to catch the dew by night which fell on the\r\nhides that covered their decks; yet all these difficulties they bore\r\npatiently and without repining, and thought they ought not to leave the\r\nshores and harbours free from blockade. But when they were suffering\r\nunder the distress which I have mentioned, and Libo had joined Bibulus,\r\nthey both called from on ship-board to Marcus Acilius and Statius\r\nMarcus, the lieutenants, one of whom commanded the town, the other the\r\nguards on the coast, that they wished to speak to Caesar on affairs of\r\nimportance, if permission should be granted them. They add something\r\nfurther to strengthen the impression that they intended to treat about\r\nan accommodation. In the meantime they requested a truce, and obtained\r\nit from them; for what they proposed seemed to be of importance, and it\r\nwas well known that Caesar desired it above all things, and it was\r\nimagined that some advantage would be derived from Bibulus's proposals.\r\n\r\nXVI.--Caesar having set out with one legion to gain possession of the\r\nmore remote states, and to provide corn, of which he had but a small\r\nquantity, was at this time at Buthrotum, opposite to Corcyra. There\r\nreceiving Acilius and Marcus's letters, informing him of Libo's and\r\nBibulus's demands, he left his legion behind him, and returned himself\r\nto Oricum. When he arrived, they were invited to a conference. Libo came\r\nand made an apology for Bibulus, \"that he was a man of strong passion,\r\nand had a private quarrel against Caesar, contracted when he was aedile\r\nand praetor; that for this reason he had avoided the conference, lest\r\naffairs of the utmost importance and advantage might be impeded by the\r\nwarmth of his temper. That it now was and ever had been Pompey's most\r\nearnest wish, that they should be reconciled, and lay down their arms;\r\nbut they were not authorized to treat on that subject, because they\r\nresigned the whole management of the war, and all other matters, to\r\nPompey, by order of the council. But when they were acquainted with\r\nCaesar's demands, they would transmit them to Pompey, who would conclude\r\nall of himself by their persuasions. In the meantime, let the truce be\r\ncontinued till the messengers could return from him; and let no injury\r\nbe done on either side.\" To this he added a few words of the cause for\r\nwhich they fought, and of his own forces and resources.\r\n\r\nXVII.--To this, Caesar did not then think proper to make any reply, nor\r\ndo we now think it worth recording. But Caesar required \"that he should\r\nbe allowed to send commissioners to Pompey, who should suffer no\r\npersonal injury; and that either they should grant it, or should take\r\nhis commissioners in charge, and convey them to Pompey. That as to the\r\ntruce, the war in its present state was so divided, that they by their\r\nfleet deprived him of his shipping and auxiliaries; while he prevented\r\nthem from the use of the land and fresh water; and if they wished that\r\nthis restraint should be removed from them, they should relinquish their\r\nblockade of the seas, but if they retained the one, he in like manner\r\nwould retain the other; that nevertheless, the treaty of accommodation\r\nmight still be carried on, though these points were not conceded, and\r\nthat they need not be an impediment to it.\" They would neither receive\r\nCaesar's commissioners, nor guarantee their safety, but referred the\r\nwhole to Pompey. They urged and struggled eagerly to gain the one point\r\nrespecting a truce. But when Caesar perceived that they had proposed the\r\nconference merely to avoid present danger and distress, but that they\r\noffered no hopes or terms of peace, he applied his thoughts to the\r\nprosecution of the war.\r\n\r\nXVIII.--Bibulus, being prevented from landing for several days, and\r\nbeing seized with a violent distemper from the cold and fatigue, as he\r\ncould neither be cured on board, nor was willing to desert the charge\r\nwhich he had taken upon him, was unable to bear up against the violence\r\nof the disease. On his death, the sole command devolved on no single\r\nindividual, but each admiral managed his own division separately, and at\r\nhis own discretion. Vibullius, as soon as the alarm, which Caesar's\r\nunexpected arrival had raised, was over, began again to deliver Caesar's\r\nmessage in the presence of Libo, Lucius Lucceius, and Theophanes, to\r\nwhom Pompey used to communicate his most confidential secrets. He had\r\nscarcely entered on the subject when Pompey interrupted him, and forbade\r\nhim to proceed. \"What need,\" says he, \"have I of life or Rome, if the\r\nworld shall think I enjoy them by the bounty of Caesar; an opinion which\r\ncan never be removed whilst it shall be thought that I have been brought\r\nback by him to Italy, from which I set out.\" After the conclusion of the\r\nwar, Caesar was informed of these expressions by some persons who were\r\npresent at the conversation. He attempted, however, by other means to\r\nbring about a negotiation of peace.\r\n\r\nXIX.--Between Pompey's and Caesar's camp there was only the river Apsus,\r\nand the soldiers frequently conversed with each other; and by a private\r\narrangement among themselves, no weapons were thrown during their\r\nconferences. Caesar sent Publius Vatinius, one of his lieutenants, to\r\nthe bank of the river, to make such proposals as should appear most\r\nconducive to peace; and to cry out frequently with a loud voice\r\n[asking], \"Are citizens permitted to send deputies to citizens to treat\r\nof peace? a concession which had been made even to fugitives on the\r\nPyrenean mountains, and to robbers, especially when by so doing they\r\nwould prevent citizens from fighting against citizens.\" Having spoken\r\nmuch in humble language, as became a man pleading for his own and the\r\ngeneral safety, and being listened to with silence by the soldiers of\r\nboth armies, he received an answer from the enemy's party that Aulus\r\nVarro proposed coming the next day to a conference, and that deputies\r\nfrom both sides might come without danger, and explain their wishes, and\r\naccordingly a fixed time was appointed for the interview. When the\r\ndeputies met the next day, a great multitude from both sides assembled,\r\nand the expectations of every person concerning this subject were raised\r\nvery high, and their minds seemed to be eagerly disposed for peace.\r\nTitus Labienus walked forward from the crowd, and in submissive terms\r\nbegan to speak of peace, and to argue with Vatinius. But their\r\nconversation was suddenly interrupted by darts thrown from all sides,\r\nfrom which Vatinius escaped by being protected by the arms of the\r\nsoldiers. However, several were wounded; and among them Cornelius\r\nBalbus, Marcus Plotius, and Lucius Tiburtius, centurions, and some\r\nprivates; hereupon Labienus exclaimed, \"Forbear, then, to speak any more\r\nabout an accommodation, for we can have no peace unless we carry\r\nCaesar's head back with us.\"\r\n\r\nXX.--At the same time in Rome, Marcus Caelius Rufus, one of the\r\npraetors, having undertaken the cause of the debtors, on entering into\r\nhis office, fixed his tribunal near the bench of Caius Trebonius, the\r\ncity praetor, and promised if any person appealed to him in regard to\r\nthe valuation and payment of debts made by arbitration, as appointed by\r\nCaesar when in Rome, that he would relieve them. But it happened, from\r\nthe justice of Trebonius's decrees and his humanity (for he thought that\r\nin such dangerous times justice should be administered with moderation\r\nand compassion), that not one could be found who would offer himself the\r\nfirst to lodge an appeal. For to plead poverty, to complain of his own\r\nprivate calamities, or the general distresses of the times, or to assert\r\nthe difficulty of setting the goods to sale, is the behaviour of a man\r\neven of a moderate temper; but to retain their possessions entire, and\r\nat the same time acknowledge themselves in debt, what sort of spirit,\r\nand what impudence would it not have argued! Therefore nobody was found\r\nso unreasonable as to make such demands. But Caelius proved more severe\r\nto those very persons for whose advantage it had been designed; and\r\nstarting from this beginning, in order that he might not appear to have\r\nengaged in so dishonourable an affair without effecting something, he\r\npromulgated a law, that all debts should be discharged in six equal\r\npayments, of six months each, without interest.\r\n\r\nXXI.--When Servilius, the consul, and the other magistrates opposed him,\r\nand he himself effected less than he expected, in order to raise the\r\npassions of the people, he dropped it, and promulgated two others; one,\r\nby which he remitted the annual rents of the houses to the tenants, the\r\nother, an act of insolvency: upon which the mob made an assault on Caius\r\nTrebonius, and having wounded several persons, drove him from his\r\ntribunal. The consul Servilius informed the senate of his proceedings,\r\nwho passed a decree that Caelius should be removed from the management\r\nof the republic. Upon this decree, the consul forbade him the senate;\r\nand when he was attempting to harangue the people, turned him out of the\r\nrostrum. Stung with the ignominy and with resentment, he pretended in\r\npublic that he would go to Caesar, but privately sent messengers to\r\nMilo, who had murdered Clodius, and had been condemned for it; and\r\nhaving invited him into Italy, because he had engaged the remains of the\r\ngladiators to his interest, by making them supple presents, he joined\r\nhim, and sent him to Thurinum to tamper with the shepherds. When he\r\nhimself was on his road to Casilinum, at the same time that his military\r\nstandards and arms were seized at Capua, his slaves seen at Naples, and\r\nthe design of betraying the town discovered: his plots being revealed,\r\nand Capua shut against him, being apprehensive of danger, because the\r\nRoman citizens residing there had armed themselves, and thought he ought\r\nto be treated as an enemy to the state, he abandoned his first design,\r\nand changed his route.\r\n\r\nXXII.--Milo in the meantime despatched letters to the free towns,\r\npurporting that he acted as he did by the orders and commands of Pompey,\r\nconveyed to him by Bibulus: and he endeavoured to engage in his interest\r\nall persons whom he imagined were under difficulties by reason of their\r\ndebts. But not being able to prevail with them, he set at liberty some\r\nslaves from the work-houses, and began to assault Cosa in the district\r\nof Thurinum. There having received a blow of a stone thrown from the\r\nwall of the town which was commanded by Quintus Pedius with one legion,\r\nhe died of it; and Caelius having set out, as he pretended for Caesar,\r\nwent to Thurii, where he was put to death as he was tampering with some\r\nof the freemen of the town, and was offering money to Caesar's Gallic\r\nand Spanish horse, which he had sent there to strengthen the garrison.\r\nAnd thus these mighty beginnings, which had embroiled Italy, and kept\r\nthe magistrates employed, found a speedy and happy issue.\r\n\r\nXXIII.--Libo having sailed from Oricum, with a fleet of fifty ships,\r\nwhich he commanded, came to Brundisium, and seized an island, which lies\r\nopposite to the harbour; judging it better to guard that place, which\r\nwas our only pass to sea, than to keep all the shores and ports blocked\r\nup by a fleet. By his sudden arrival, he fell in with some of our\r\ntransports, and set them on fire, and carried off one laden with corn;\r\nhe struck great terror into our men, and having in the night landed a\r\nparty of soldiers and archers, he beat our guard of horse from their\r\nstation, and gained so much by the advantage of situation, that he\r\ndespatched letters to Pompey, that if he pleased he might order the rest\r\nof the ships to be hauled upon shore and repaired; for that with his own\r\nfleet he could prevent Caesar from receiving his auxiliaries.\r\n\r\nXXIV.--Antonius was at this time at Brundisium, and relying on the\r\nvalour of his troops, covered about sixty of the long-boats belonging to\r\nthe men-of-war with penthouses and bulwarks of hurdles, and put on board\r\nthem select soldiers; and disposed them separately along the shore: and\r\nunder the pretext of keeping the seamen in exercise, he ordered two\r\nthree-banked galleys, which he had built at Brundisium, to row to the\r\nmouth of the port. When Libo saw them advancing boldly towards him, he\r\nsent five four-banked galleys against them, in hopes of intercepting\r\nthem. When these came near our ships, our veteran soldiers retreated\r\nwithin the harbour. The enemy, urged by their eagerness to capture them,\r\npursued them unguardedly; for instantly the boats of Antonius, on a\r\ncertain signal, rowed with great violence from all parts against the\r\nenemy; and at the first charge took one of the four-banked galleys, with\r\nthe seamen and marines, and forced the rest to flee disgracefully. In\r\naddition to this loss, they were prevented from getting water by the\r\nhorse which Antonius had disposed along the sea-coast. Libo, vexed at\r\nthe distress and disgrace, departed from Brundisium, and abandoned the\r\nblockade.\r\n\r\nXXV.--Several months had now elapsed, and winter was almost gone, and\r\nCaesar's legions and shipping were not coming to him from Brundisium,\r\nand he imagined that some opportunities had been neglected, for the\r\nwinds had at least been often favourable, and he thought that he must\r\ntrust to them at last. And the longer it was deferred, the more eager\r\nwere those who commanded Pompey's fleet to guard the coast, and were\r\nmore confident of preventing our getting assistance: they receive\r\nfrequent reproofs from Pompey by letter, that as they had not prevented\r\nCaesar's arrival at the first, they should at least stop the remainder\r\nof his army: and they were expecting that the season for transporting\r\ntroops would become more unfavourable every day, as the winds grew\r\ncalmer. Caesar, feeling some trouble on this account, wrote in severe\r\nterms to his officers at Brundisium, [and gave them orders] that as soon\r\nas they found the wind to answer, they should not let the opportunity of\r\nsetting sail pass by, if they were even to steer their course to the\r\nshore of Apollonia: because there they might run their ships on ground.\r\nThat these parts principally were left unguarded by the enemy's fleet,\r\nbecause they dare not venture too far from the harbour.\r\n\r\nXXVI.--They [his officers], exerting boldness and courage, aided by the\r\ninstructions of Marcus Antonius, and Fufius Kalenus, and animated by the\r\nsoldiers strongly encouraging them, and declining no danger for Caesar's\r\nsafety, having got a southerly wind, weighed anchor, and the next day\r\nwere carried past Apollonia and Dyrrachium, and being seen from the\r\ncontinent, Quintus Coponius, who commanded the Rhodian fleet at\r\nDyrrachium, put out of the port with his ships; and when they had almost\r\ncome up with us, in consequence of the breeze dying away, the south wind\r\nsprang up afresh, and rescued us. However, he did not desist from his\r\nattempt, but hoped by the labour and perseverance of his seamen to be\r\nable to bear up against the violence of the storm; and although we were\r\ncarried beyond Dyrrachium, by the violence of the wind, he nevertheless\r\ncontinued to chase us. Our men, taking advantage of fortune's kindness,\r\nfor they were still afraid of being attacked by the enemy's fleet, if\r\nthe wind abated, having come near a port, called Nymphaeum, about three\r\nmiles beyond Lissus, put into it (this port is protected from a\r\nsouth-west wind, but is not secure against a south wind); and thought less\r\ndanger was to be apprehended from the storm than from the enemy. But as\r\nsoon as they were within the port, the south wind, which had blown for\r\ntwo days, by extraordinary good luck veered round to the south-west.\r\n\r\nXXVII.--Here one might observe the sudden turns of fortune. We who, a\r\nmoment before, were alarmed for ourselves, were safely lodged in a very\r\nsecure harbour: and they who had threatened ruin to our fleet, were\r\nforced to be uneasy on their own account: and thus, by a change of\r\ncircumstances, the storm protected our ships, and damaged the Rhodian\r\nfleet to such a degree, that all their decked ships, sixteen in number,\r\nfoundered, without exception, and were wrecked: and of the prodigious\r\nnumber of seamen and soldiers, some lost their lives by being dashed\r\nagainst the rocks, others were taken by our men: but Caesar sent them\r\nall safe home.\r\n\r\nXXVIII.--Two of our ships, that had not kept up with the rest, being\r\novertaken by the night, and not knowing what port the rest had made to,\r\ncame to an anchor opposite Lissus. Otacilius Crassus, who commanded\r\nPompey's fleet, detached after them several barges and small craft, and\r\nattempted to take them. At the same time, he treated with them about\r\ncapitulating, and promised them their lives if they would surrender. One\r\nof them carried two hundred and twenty recruits, the other was manned\r\nwith somewhat less than two hundred veterans. Here it might be seen what\r\nsecurity men derive from a resolute spirit. For the recruits, frightened\r\nat the number of vessels, and fatigued with the rolling of the sea; and\r\nwith sea-sickness, surrendered to Otacilius, after having first received\r\nhis oath, that the enemy would not injure them; but as soon as they were\r\nbrought before him, contrary to the obligation of his oath, they were\r\ninhumanly put to death in his presence. But the soldiers of the veteran\r\nlegion, who had also struggled, not only with the inclemency of the\r\nweather, but by labouring at the pump, thought it their duty to remit\r\nnothing of their former valour: and having protracted the beginning of\r\nthe night in settling the terms, under pretence of surrendering, they\r\nobliged the pilot to run the ship aground: and having got a convenient\r\nplace on the shore, they spent the rest of the night there, and at\r\ndaybreak, when Otacilius had sent against them a party of the horse, who\r\nguarded that part of the coast, to the number of four hundred, besides\r\nsome armed men, who had followed them from the garrison, they made a\r\nbrave defence, and having killed some of them, retreated in safety to\r\nour army.\r\n\r\nXXIX.--After this action, the Roman citizens, who resided at Lissus, a\r\ntown which Caesar had before assigned them, and had carefully fortified,\r\nreceived Antony into their town, and gave him every assistance.\r\nOtacilius, apprehensive for his own safety, escaped out of the town, and\r\nwent to Pompey. All his forces, whose number amounted to three veteran\r\nlegions, and one of recruits, and about eight hundred horse, being\r\nlanded, Antony sent most of his ships back to Italy, to transport the\r\nremainder of the soldiers and horse. The pontons, which are a sort of\r\nGallic ships, he left at Lissus with this object, that if Pompey,\r\nimagining Italy defenceless, should transport his army thither (and this\r\nnotion was spread among the common people), Caesar might have some means\r\nof pursuing him; and he sent messengers to him with great despatch, to\r\ninform him in what part of the country he had landed his army, and what\r\nnumber of troops he had brought over with him.\r\n\r\nXXX.--Caesar and Pompey received this intelligence almost at the same\r\ntime; for they had seen the ships sail past Apollonia and Dyrrachium.\r\nThey directed their march after them by land; but at first they were\r\nignorant to what part they had been carried; but when they were informed\r\nof it, they each adopted a different plan; Caesar, to form a junction\r\nwith Antonius as soon as possible, Pompey, to oppose Antonius's forces\r\non their march to Caesar, and, if possible, to fall upon them\r\nunexpectedly from ambush. And the same day they both led out their\r\narmies from their winter encampment along the river Apsus; Pompey,\r\nprivately by night; Caesar, openly by day. But Caesar had to march a\r\nlonger circuit up the river to find a ford. Pompey's route being easy,\r\nbecause he was not obliged to cross the river, he advanced rapidly and\r\nby forced marches against Antonius, and being informed of his approach,\r\nchose a convenient situation, where he posted his forces; and kept his\r\nmen close within camp, and forbade fires to be kindled, that his arrival\r\nmight be the more secret. An account of this was immediately carried to\r\nAntonius by the Greeks. He despatched messengers to Caesar, and confined\r\nhimself in his camp for one day. The next day Caesar came up with him.\r\nOn learning his arrival, Pompey, to prevent his being hemmed in between\r\ntwo armies, quitted his position, and went with all his forces to\r\nAsparagium, in the territory of Dyrrachium, and there encamped in a\r\nconvenient situation.\r\n\r\nXXXI.--During these times, Scipio, though he had sustained some losses\r\nnear mount Amanus, had assumed to himself the title of imperator, after\r\nwhich he demanded large sums of money from the states and princes. He\r\nhad also exacted from the tax-gatherers two years' rents that they owed;\r\nand enjoined them to lend him the amount of the next year, and demanded\r\na supply of horse from the whole province. When they were collected,\r\nleaving behind him his neighbouring enemies, the Parthians (who shortly\r\nbefore had killed Marcus Crassus, the imperator, and had kept Marcus\r\nBibulus besieged), he drew his legions and cavalry out of Syria; and\r\nwhen he came into the province, which was under great anxiety and fear\r\nof the Parthian war, and heard some declarations of the soldiers, \"That\r\nthey would march against an enemy, if he would lead them on; but would\r\nnever bear arms against a countryman and consul\"; he drew off his\r\nlegions to winter quarters to Pergamus, and the most wealthy cities, and\r\nmade them rich presents: and in order to attach them more firmly to his\r\ninterest, permitted them to plunder the cities.\r\n\r\nXXXII.--In the meantime, the money which had been demanded from the\r\nprovince at large, was most rigorously exacted. Besides, many new\r\nimposts of different kinds were devised to gratify his avarice. A tax of\r\nso much a head was laid on every slave and child. Columns, doors, corn,\r\nsoldiers, sailors, arms, engines, and carriages, were made subject to a\r\nduty. Wherever a name could be found for anything, it was deemed a\r\nsufficient reason for levying money on it. Officers were appointed to\r\ncollect it, not only in the cities, but in almost every village and\r\nfort: and whosoever of them acted with the greatest rigour and\r\ninhumanity, was esteemed the best man, and best citizen. The province\r\nwas overrun with bailiffs and officers, and crowded with overseers and\r\ntax-gatherers; who, besides the duties imposed, exacted a gratuity for\r\nthemselves; for they asserted, that being expelled from their own homes\r\nand countries, they stood in need of every necessary; endeavouring by a\r\nplausible pretence to colour the most infamous conduct. To this was\r\nadded the most exorbitant interest, as usually happens in times of war;\r\nthe whole sums being called in, on which occasion they alleged that the\r\ndelay of a single day was a donation. Therefore, in those two years, the\r\ndebt of the province was doubled: but notwithstanding, taxes were\r\nexacted, not only from the Roman citizens, but from every corporation\r\nand every state. And they said that these were loans, exacted by the\r\nsenate's decree. The taxes of the ensuing year were demanded beforehand\r\nas a loan from the collectors, as on their first appointment.\r\n\r\nXXXIII.--Moreover, Scipio ordered the money formerly lodged in the\r\ntemple of Diana at Ephesus, to be taken out with the statues of that\r\ngoddess which remained there. When Scipio came to the temple, letters\r\nwere delivered to him from Pompey, in the presence of several senators,\r\nwhom he had called upon to attend him; [informing him] that Caesar had\r\ncrossed the sea with his legions; that Scipio should hasten to him with\r\nhis army, and postpone all other business. As soon as he received the\r\nletter, he dismissed his attendants, and began to prepare for his\r\njourney to Macedonia; and a few days after set out. This circumstance\r\nsaved the money at Ephesus.\r\n\r\nXXXIV.--Caesar, having effected a junction with Antonius's army, and\r\nhaving drawn his legion out of Oricum, which he had left there to guard\r\nthe coast, thought he ought to sound the inclination of the provinces,\r\nand march farther into the country; and when ambassadors came to him\r\nfrom Thessaly and Aetolia, to engage that the states in those countries\r\nwould obey his orders, if he sent a garrison to protect them, he\r\ndespatched Lucius Cassius Longinus, with the twenty-seventh, a legion\r\ncomposed of young soldiers, and two hundred horse, to Thessaly: and\r\nCaius Calvisius Sabinus, with five cohorts, and a small party of horse,\r\ninto Aetolia. He recommended them to be especially careful to provide\r\ncorn, because those regions were nearest to him. He ordered Cneius\r\nDomitius Calvinus to march into Macedonia with two legions, the eleventh\r\nand twelfth, and five hundred horse; from which province, Menedemus, the\r\nprincipal man of those regions, on that side which is called the Free,\r\nhaving come as ambassador, assured him of the most devoted affection of\r\nall his subjects.\r\n\r\nXXXV.--Of these Calvisius, on his first arrival in Aetolia, being very\r\nkindly received, dislodged the enemy's garrisons in Calydon and\r\nNaupactus, and made himself master of the whole country. Cassius went to\r\nThessaly with his legion. As there were two factions there, he found the\r\ncitizens divided in their inclinations. Hegasaretus, a man of\r\nestablished power, favoured Pompey's interest. Petreius, a young man of\r\na most noble family, warmly supported Caesar with his own and his\r\nfriends' influence.\r\n\r\nXXXVI.--At the same time, Domitius arrived in Macedonia: and when\r\nnumerous embassies had begun to wait on him from many of the states,\r\nnews was brought that Scipio was approaching with his legions, which\r\noccasioned various opinions and reports; for in strange events, rumour\r\ngenerally goes before. Without making any delay in any part of\r\nMacedonia, he marched with great haste against Domitius; and when he was\r\ncome within about twenty miles of him, wheeled on a sudden towards\r\nCassius Longinus in Thessaly. He effected this with such celerity, that\r\nnews of his march and arrival came together; for to render his march\r\nexpeditious, he left the baggage of his legions behind him at the river\r\nHaliacmon, which divides Macedonia from Thessaly, under the care of\r\nMarcus Favonius, with a guard of eight cohorts, and ordered him to build\r\na strong fort there. At the same time, Cotus's cavalry, which used to\r\ninfest the neighbourhood of Macedonia, flew to attack Cassius's camp, at\r\nwhich Cassius being alarmed, and having received information of Scipio's\r\napproach, and seen the horse, which he imagined to be Scipio's, he\r\nbetook himself to the mountains that environ Thessaly, and thence began\r\nto make his route towards Ambracia. But when Scipio was hastening to\r\npursue him, despatches overtook him from Favonius, that Domitius was\r\nmarching against him with his legions, and that he could not maintain\r\nthe garrison over which he was appointed, without Scipio's assistance.\r\nOn receipt of these despatches, Scipio changed his designs and his\r\nroute, desisted from his pursuit of Cassius, and hastened to relieve\r\nFavonius. Accordingly, continuing his march day and night, he came to\r\nhim so opportunely, that the dust raised by Domitius's army, and\r\nScipio's advanced guard, were observed at the same instant. Thus, the\r\nvigilance of Domitius saved Cassius, and the expedition of Scipio,\r\nFavonius.\r\n\r\nXXXVII--Scipio, having stayed for two days in his camp, along the river\r\nHaliacmon, which ran between him and Domitius's camp, on the third day,\r\nat dawn, led his army across a ford, and having made a regular\r\nencampment the day following, drew up his forces in front of his camp.\r\nDomitius thought he ought not to show any reluctance, but should draw\r\nout his forces and hazard a battle. But as there was a plain six miles\r\nin breadth between the two camps, he posted his army before Scipio's\r\ncamp; while the latter persevered in not quitting his entrenchment.\r\nHowever, Domitius with difficulty restrained his men, and prevented\r\ntheir beginning a battle; the more so as a rivulet with steep banks,\r\njoining Scipio's camp, retarded the progress of our men. When Scipio\r\nperceived the eagerness and alacrity of our troops to engage, suspecting\r\nthat he should be obliged the next day, either to fight, against his\r\ninclination, or to incur great disgrace by keeping within his camp,\r\nthough he had come with high expectation, yet by advancing rashly, made\r\na shameful end; and at night crossed the river, without even giving the\r\nsignal for breaking up the camp, and returned to the ground from which\r\nhe came, and there encamped near the river, on an elevated situation.\r\nAfter a few days, he placed a party of horse in ambush in the night,\r\nwhere our men had usually gone to forage for several days before. And\r\nwhen Quintus Varus, commander of Domitius's horse, came there as usual,\r\nthey suddenly rushed from their ambush. But our men bravely supported\r\ntheir charge, and returned quickly every man to his own rank, and in\r\ntheir turn, made a general charge on the enemy: and having killed about\r\neighty of them, and put the rest to flight, retreated to their camp with\r\nthe loss of only two men.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII.--After these transactions, Domitius, hoping to allure Scipio to\r\na battle, pretended to be obliged to change his position through want of\r\ncorn, and having given the signal for decamping, advanced about three\r\nmiles, and posted his army and cavalry in a convenient place, concealed\r\nfrom the enemy's view. Scipio being in readiness to pursue him, detached\r\nhis cavalry and a considerable number of light infantry to explore\r\nDomitius's route. When they had marched a short way, and their foremost\r\ntroops were within reach of our ambush, their suspicions being raised by\r\nthe neighing of the horses, they began to retreat: and the rest who\r\nfollowed them, observing with what speed they retreated, made a halt.\r\nOur men, perceiving that the enemy had discovered their plot, and\r\nthinking it in vain to wait for any more, having got two troops in their\r\npower, intercepted them. Among them was Marcus Opimius, general of the\r\nhorse, but he made his escape: they either killed or took prisoners all\r\nthe rest of these two troops, and brought them to Domitius.\r\n\r\nXXXIX.--Caesar, having drawn his garrisons out of the sea-ports, as\r\nbefore mentioned, left three cohorts at Oricum to protect the town, and\r\ncommitted to them the charge of his ships of war, which he had\r\ntransported from Italy. Acilius, as lieutenant-general, had the charge\r\nof this duty and the command of the town; he drew the ships into the\r\ninner part of the harbour, behind the town, and fastened them to the\r\nshore, and sank a merchant-ship in the mouth of the harbour to block it\r\nup; and near it he fixed another at anchor, on which he raised a turret,\r\nand faced it to the entrance of the port, and filled it with soldiers,\r\nand ordered them to keep guard against any sudden attack.\r\n\r\nXL.--Cneius, Pompey's son, who commanded the Egyptian fleet, having got\r\nintelligence of these things, came to Oricum, and weighed up the ship,\r\nthat had been sunk, with a windlass, and by straining at it with several\r\nropes, and attacked the other which had been placed by Acilius to watch\r\nthe port with several ships, on which he had raised very high turrets,\r\nso that fighting as it were from an eminence, and sending fresh men\r\nconstantly to relieve the fatigued, and at the same time attempting the\r\ntown on all sides by land, with ladders and his fleet, in order to\r\ndivide the force of his enemies, he overpowered our men by fatigue, and\r\nthe immense number of darts, and took the ship, having beat off the men\r\nwho were put on board to defend it, who, however, made their escape in\r\nsmall boats; and at the same time he seized a natural mole on the\r\nopposite side, which almost formed an island over against the town. He\r\ncarried over land, into the inner part of the harbour, four galleys, by\r\nputting rollers under them, and driving them on with levers. Then\r\nattacking on both sides the ships of war which were moored to the shore,\r\nand were not manned, he carried off four of them, and set the rest on\r\nfire. After despatching this business, he left Decimus Laelius, whom he\r\nhad taken away from the command of the Asiatic fleet, to hinder\r\nprovisions from being brought into the town from Biblis and Amantia, and\r\nwent himself to Lissus, where he attacked thirty merchantmen, left\r\nwithin the port by Antonius, and set them on fire. He attempted to storm\r\nLissus, but being delayed three days by the vigorous defence of the\r\nRoman citizens who belonged to that district, and of the soldiers which\r\nCaesar had sent to keep garrison there, and having lost a few men in the\r\nassault, he returned without effecting his object.\r\n\r\nXLI.--As soon as Caesar heard that Pompey was at Asparagium, he set out\r\nfor that place with his army, and having taken the capital of the\r\nParthinians on his march, where there was a garrison of Pompey's, he\r\nreached Pompey in Macedonia, on the third day, and encamped beside him;\r\nand the day following, having drawn out all his forces before his camp,\r\nhe offered Pompey battle. But perceiving that he kept within his\r\ntrenches, he led his army back to his camp, and thought of pursuing some\r\nother plan. Accordingly, the day following, he set out with all his\r\nforces by a long circuit, through a difficult and narrow road to\r\nDyrrachium; hoping, either that Pompey would be compelled to follow him\r\nto Dyrrachium, or that his communication with it might be cut off,\r\nbecause he had deposited there all his provisions and mat['e]riel of\r\nwar. And so it happened; for Pompey, at first not knowing his design,\r\nbecause he imagined he had taken a route in a different direction from\r\nthat country, thought that the scarcity of provisions had obliged him to\r\nshift his quarters; but having afterwards got true intelligence from his\r\nscouts, he decamped the day following, hoping to prevent him by taking a\r\nshorter road; which Caesar suspecting might happen, encouraged his\r\ntroops to submit cheerfully to the fatigue, and having halted a very\r\nsmall part of the night, he arrived early in the morning at Dyrrachium,\r\nwhen the van of Pompey's army was visible at a distance, and there he\r\nencamped.\r\n\r\nXLII.--Pompey, being cut off from Dyrrachium, as he was unable to effect\r\nhis purpose, took a new resolution, and entrenched himself strongly on a\r\nrising ground, which is called Petra, where ships of a small size can\r\ncome in, and be sheltered from some winds. Here he ordered a part of his\r\nmen-of-war to attend him, and corn and provisions to be brought from\r\nAsia, and from all the countries of which he kept possession. Caesar,\r\nimagining that the war would be protracted to too great a length, and\r\ndespairing of his convoys from Italy, because all the coasts were\r\nguarded with great diligence by Pompey's adherents; and because his own\r\nfleets, which he had built during the winter, in Sicily, Gaul, and\r\nItaly, were detained; sent Lucius Canuleius into Epirus to procure corn;\r\nand because these countries were too remote, he fixed granaries in\r\ncertain places, and regulated the carriage of the corn for the\r\nneighbouring states. He likewise gave directions that search should be\r\nmade for whatever corn was in Lissus, the country of the Parthini, and\r\nall the places of strength. The quantity was very small, both from the\r\nnature of the land (for the country is rough and mountainous, and the\r\npeople commonly import what grain they use); and because Pompey had\r\nforeseen what would happen, and some days before had plundered the\r\nParthini, and having ravaged and dug up their houses, carried off all\r\nthe corn, which he collected by means of his horse.\r\n\r\nXLIII.--Caesar, on being informed of these transactions, pursued\r\nmeasures suggested by the nature of the country. For round Pompey's\r\ncamps there were several high and rough hills. These he first of all\r\noccupied with guards, and raised strong forts on them. Then drawing a\r\nfortification from one fort to another, as the nature of each position\r\nallowed, he began to draw a line of circumvallation round Pompey; with\r\nthese views; as he had but a small quantity of corn, and Pompey was\r\nstrong in cavalry, that he might furnish his army with corn and other\r\nnecessaries from all sides with less danger: secondly, to prevent Pompey\r\nfrom foraging, and thereby render his horse ineffectual in the\r\noperations of the war; and thirdly, to lessen his reputation, on which\r\nhe saw he depended greatly, among foreign nations, when a report should\r\nhave spread throughout the world that he was blockaded by Caesar, and\r\ndare not hazard a battle.\r\n\r\nXLIV.--Neither was Pompey willing to leave the sea and Dyrrachium,\r\nbecause he had lodged his mat['e]riel there, his weapons, arms, and\r\nengines; and supplied his army with corn from it by his ships: nor was\r\nhe able to put a stop to Caesar's works without hazarding a battle,\r\nwhich at that time he had determined not to do. Nothing was left but to\r\nadopt the last resource, namely, to possess himself of as many hills as\r\nhe could, and cover as great an extent of country as possible with his\r\ntroops, and divide Caesar's forces as much as possible; and so it\r\nhappened: for having raised twenty-four forts, and taken in a compass of\r\nfifteen miles, he got forage in this space, and within this circuit\r\nthere were several fields lately sown, in which the cattle might feed in\r\nthe meantime. And as our men, who had completed their works by drawing\r\nlines of communication from one fort to another, were afraid that\r\nPompey's men would sally out from some part, and attack us in the rear;\r\nso the enemy were making a continued fortification in a circuit within\r\nours to prevent us from breaking in on any side, or surrounding them on\r\nthe rear. But they completed their works first; both because they had a\r\ngreater number of men, and because they had a smaller compass to\r\nenclose. When Caesar attempted to gain any place, though Pompey had\r\nresolved not to oppose him with his whole force or to come to a general\r\nengagement; yet he detached to particular places slingers and archers,\r\nwith which his army abounded, and several of our men were wounded, and\r\nfilled with great dread of the arrows; and almost all the soldiers made\r\ncoats or coverings for themselves of hair cloths, tarpaulins, or raw\r\nhides to defend them against the weapons.\r\n\r\nXLV.--In seizing the posts, each exerted his utmost power: Caesar, to\r\nconfine Pompey within as narrow a compass as possible; Pompey, to occupy\r\nas many hills as he could in as large a circuit as possible, and several\r\nskirmishes were fought in consequence of it. In one of these, when\r\nCaesar's ninth legion had gained a certain post, and had begun to\r\nfortify it; Pompey possessed himself of a hill near to and opposite the\r\nsame place, and endeavoured to annoy the men while at work; and as the\r\napproach on one side was almost level, he first surrounded it with\r\narchers and slingers, and afterwards by detaching a strong party of\r\nlight infantry, and using his engines, he stopped our works: and it was\r\nno easy matter for our men at once to defend themselves, and to proceed\r\nwith their fortifications. When Caesar perceived that his troops were\r\nwounded from all sides, he determined to retreat and give up the post;\r\nhis retreat was down a precipice, on which account they pushed on with\r\nmore spirit, and would not allow us to retire, because they imagined\r\nthat we resigned the place through fear. It is reported that Pompey said\r\nthat day in triumph to his friends about him, \"That he would consent to\r\nbe accounted a general of no experience, if Caesar's legions effected a\r\nretreat without considerable loss from that ground into which they had\r\nrashly advanced.\"\r\n\r\nXLVI.--Caesar, being uneasy about the retreat of his soldiers, ordered\r\nhurdles to be carried to the further side of the hill, and to be placed\r\nopposite to the enemy, and behind them a trench of a moderate breadth to\r\nbe sunk by his soldiers under shelter of the hurdles: and the ground to\r\nbe made as difficult as possible. He himself disposed slingers in\r\nconvenient places to cover our men in their retreat. These things being\r\ncompleted, he ordered his legions to file off. Pompey's men insultingly\r\nand boldly pursued and chased us, levelling the hurdles that were thrown\r\nup in the front of our works, in order to pass over the trench. Which as\r\nsoon as Caesar perceived, being afraid that his men would appear not to\r\nretreat, but to be repulsed, and that greater loss might be sustained,\r\nwhen his men were almost half way down the hill, he encouraged them by\r\nAntonius, who commanded that legion, ordered the signal of battle to be\r\nsounded, and a charge to be made on the enemy. The soldiers of the ninth\r\nlegion suddenly closing their files threw their javelins, and advancing\r\nimpetuously from the low ground up the steep, drove Pompey's men\r\nprecipitately before them, and obliged them to turn their backs; but\r\ntheir retreat was greatly impeded by the hurdles that lay in a long line\r\nbefore them, and the pallisadoes which were in their way, and the\r\ntrenches that were sunk. But our men being contented to retreat without\r\ninjury, having killed several of the enemy, and lost but five of their\r\nown, very quietly retired, and having seized some other hills somewhat\r\non this side of that place, completed their fortifications.\r\n\r\nXLVII.--This method of conducting a war was new and unusual, as well on\r\naccount of the number of forts, the extent and greatness of the works,\r\nand the manner of attack and defence, as on account of other\r\ncircumstances. For all who have attempted to besiege any person, have\r\nattacked the enemy when they were frightened or weak, or after a defeat;\r\nor have been kept in fear of some attack, when they themselves have had\r\na superior force both of foot and horse. Besides, the usual design of a\r\nsiege is to cut off the enemy's supplies. On the contrary, Caesar, with\r\nan inferior force, was enclosing troops sound and unhurt, and who had\r\nabundance of all things. For there arrived every day a prodigious number\r\nof ships, which brought them provisions: nor could the wind blow from\r\nany point that would not be favourable to some of them. Whereas, Caesar,\r\nhaving consumed all the corn far and near, was in very great distress,\r\nbut his soldiers bore all with uncommon patience. For they remembered\r\nthat they lay under the same difficulties last year in Spain, and yet by\r\nlabour and patience had concluded a dangerous war. They recollected too\r\nthat they had suffered an alarming scarcity at Alesia, and a much\r\ngreater at Avaricum, and yet had returned victorious over mighty\r\nnations. They refused neither barley nor pulse when offered them, and\r\nthey held in great esteem cattle, of which they got great quantities\r\nfrom Epirus.\r\n\r\nXLVIII.--There was a sort of root, called chara, discovered by the\r\ntroops which served under Valerius. This they mixed up with milk, and it\r\ngreatly contributed to relieve their want. They made it into a sort of\r\nbread. They had great plenty of it: loaves made of this, when Pompey's\r\nmen upbraided ours with want, they frequently threw among them to damp\r\ntheir hopes.\r\n\r\nXLIX.--The corn was now beginning to ripen, and their hope supported\r\ntheir want, as they were confident of having abundance in a short time.\r\nAnd there were frequently heard declarations of the soldiers on guard,\r\nin discourse with each other, that they would rather live on the bark of\r\nthe trees, than let Pompey escape from their hands. For they were often\r\ntold by deserters, that they could scarcely maintain their horses, and\r\nthat their other cattle was dead: that they themselves were not in good\r\nhealth from their confinement within so narrow a compass, from the\r\nnoisome smell, the number of carcasses, and the constant fatigue to\r\nthem, being men unaccustomed to work, and labouring under a great want\r\nof water. For Caesar had either turned the course of all the rivers and\r\nstreams which ran to the sea, or had dammed them up with strong works.\r\nAnd as the country was mountainous, and the valleys narrow at the\r\nbottom, he enclosed them with piles sunk in the ground, and heaped up\r\nmould against them to keep in the water. They were therefore obliged to\r\nsearch for low and marshy grounds, and to sink wells, and they had this\r\nlabour in addition to their daily works. And even these springs were at\r\na considerable distance from some of their posts, and soon dried up with\r\nthe heat. But Caesar's army enjoyed perfect health and abundance of\r\nwater, and had plenty of all sorts of provisions except corn; and they\r\nhad a prospect of better times approaching, and saw greater hopes laid\r\nbefore them by the ripening of the grain.\r\n\r\nL.--In this new kind of war, new methods of managing it were invented by\r\nboth generals. Pompey's men, perceiving by our fires at night, at what\r\npart of the works our cohorts were on guard, coming silently upon them\r\ndischarged their arrows at random among the whole multitude, and\r\ninstantly retired to their camp: as a remedy against which our men were\r\ntaught by experience to light their fires in one place, and keep guard\r\nin another.\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\nLI.--In the meantime, Publius Sylla, whom Caesar at his departure had\r\nleft governor of his camp, came up with two legions to assist the\r\ncohort; upon whose arrival Pompey's forces were easily repulsed. Nor did\r\nthey stand the sight and charge of our men, and the foremost falling,\r\nthe rest turned their backs and quitted the field. But Sylla called our\r\nmen in from the pursuit, lest their ardour should carry them too far,\r\nbut most people imagine, that if he had consented to a vigorous pursuit,\r\nthe war might have been ended that day. His conduct however does not\r\nappear to deserve censure; for the duties of a lieutenant-general and of\r\na commander-in-chief are very different; the one is bound to act\r\nentirely according to his instructions, the other to regulate his\r\nconduct without control, as occasion requires. Sylla, being deputed by\r\nCaesar to take care of the camp, and having rescued his men, was\r\nsatisfied with that, and did not desire to hazard a battle (although\r\nthis circumstance might probably have had a successful issue), that he\r\nmight not be thought to have assumed the part of the general. One\r\ncircumstance laid the Pompeians under great difficulty in making good a\r\nretreat: for they had advanced from disadvantageous ground, and were\r\nposted on the top of a hill. If they attempted to retire down the steep,\r\nthey dreaded the pursuit of our men from the rising ground, and there\r\nwas but a short time till sunset: for in hopes of completing the\r\nbusiness, they had protracted the battle almost till night. Taking\r\ntherefore measures suited to their exigency, and to the shortness of the\r\ntime, Pompey possessed himself of an eminence, at such a distance from\r\nour fort, that no weapon discharged from an engine could reach him. Here\r\nhe took up a position, and fortified it, and kept all his forces there.\r\n\r\nLII.--At the same time, there were engagements in two other places; for\r\nPompey had attacked several forts at once, in order to divide our\r\nforces; that no relief might be sent from the neighbouring posts. In one\r\nplace, Volcatius Tullus sustained the charge of a legion with three\r\ncohorts, and beat them off the field. In another, the Germans, having\r\nsallied over our fortifications, slew several of the enemy, and\r\nretreated safe to our camp.\r\n\r\nLIII.--Thus six engagements having happened in one day, three at\r\nDyrrachium, and three at the fortifications, when a computation was made\r\nof the number of slain, we found that about two thousand fell on\r\nPompey's side, several of them volunteer veterans and centurions. Among\r\nthem was Valerius, the son of Lucius Flaccus, who as praetor had\r\nformerly had the government of Asia, and six military standards were\r\ntaken. Of our men, not more than twenty were missing in all the action.\r\nBut in the fort, not a single soldier escaped without a wound; and in\r\none cohort, four centurions lost their eyes. And being desirous to\r\nproduce testimony of the fatigue they underwent, and the danger they\r\nsustained, they counted to Caesar about thirty thousand arrows which had\r\nbeen thrown into the fort; and in the shield of the centurion Scaeva,\r\nwhich was brought to him, were found two hundred and thirty holes. In\r\nreward for this man's services both to himself and the republic, Caesar\r\npresented to him two hundred thousand pieces of copper money, and\r\ndeclared him promoted from the eighth to the first centurion. For it\r\nappeared that the fort had been in a great measure saved by his\r\nexertions; and he afterwards very amply rewarded the cohorts with double\r\npay, corn, clothing, and other military honours.\r\n\r\nLIV.--Pompey, having made great additions to his works in the night, the\r\nfollowing days built turrets, and having carried his works fifteen feet\r\nhigh, faced that part of his camp with mantlets; and after an interval\r\nof five days, taking advantage of a second cloudy night, he barricaded\r\nall the gates of his camp to hinder a pursuit, and about midnight\r\nquietly marched off his army, and retreated to his old fortifications.\r\n\r\nLV.--Aetolia, Acarnania, and Amphilochis, being reduced, as we have\r\nrelated, by Cassius Longinus, and Calvisius Sabinus, Caesar thought he\r\nought to attempt the conquest of Achaia, and to advance farther into the\r\ncountry. Accordingly, he detached Fufius thither, and ordered Quintus\r\nSabinus and Cassius to join him with their cohorts. Upon notice of their\r\napproach, Rutilius Lupus, who commanded in Achaia, under Pompey, began\r\nto fortify the Isthmus, to prevent Fufius from coming into Achaia.\r\nKalenus recovered Delphi, Thebes, and Orchomenus, by a voluntary\r\nsubmission of those states. Some he subdued by force, the rest he\r\nendeavoured to win over to Caesar's interest, by sending deputies round\r\nto them. In these things, principally, Fufius was employed.\r\n\r\nLVI.--Every day afterwards, Caesar drew up his army on a level ground,\r\nand offered Pompey battle, and led his legions almost close to Pompey's\r\ncamp; and his front line was at no greater distance from the rampart\r\nthan that no weapons from their engines could reach it. But Pompey, to\r\nsave his credit and reputation with the world, drew out his legions, but\r\nso close to his camp that his rear lines might touch the rampart, and\r\nthat his whole army, when drawn up, might be protected by the darts\r\ndischarged from it.\r\n\r\nLVII.--Whilst these things were going forward in Achaia and at\r\nDyrrachium, and when it was certainly known that Scipio was arrived in\r\nMacedonia, Caesar, never losing sight of his first intention, sends\r\nClodius to him, an intimate friend to both, whom Caesar, on the\r\nintroduction and recommendation of Pompey, had admitted into the number\r\nof his acquaintance. To this man he gave letters and instructions to\r\nPompey, the substance of which was as follows: \"That he had made every\r\neffort towards peace, and imputed the ill success of those efforts to\r\nthe fault of those whom he had employed to conduct those negotiations:\r\nbecause they were afraid to carry his proposals to Pompey at an improper\r\ntime. That Scipio had such authority, that he could not only freely\r\nexplain what conduct met his approbation, but even in some degree\r\nenforce his advice, and govern him [Pompey] if he persisted in error;\r\nthat he commanded an army independent of Pompey, so that besides his\r\nauthority, he had strength to compel; and if he did so, all men would be\r\nindebted to him for the quiet of Italy, the peace of the provinces, and\r\nthe preservation of the empire.\" These proposals Clodius made to him,\r\nand for some days at the first appeared to have met with a favourable\r\nreception, but afterwards was not admitted to an audience; for Scipio\r\nbeing reprimanded by Favonius, as we found afterwards when the war was\r\nended, and the negotiation having miscarried, Clodius returned to\r\nCaesar.\r\n\r\nLVIII.--Caesar, that he might the more easily keep Pompey's horse\r\nenclosed within Dyrrachium, and prevent them from foraging, fortified\r\nthe two narrow passes already mentioned with strong works, and erected\r\nforts at them. Pompey perceiving that he derived no advantage from his\r\ncavalry, after a few days had them conveyed back to his camp by sea.\r\nFodder was so exceedingly scarce that he was obliged to feed his horses\r\nupon leaves stripped off the trees, or the tender roots of reeds\r\npounded. For the corn which had been sown within the lines was already\r\nconsumed, and they would be obliged to supply themselves with fodder\r\nfrom Corcyra and Acarnania, over a long tract of sea; and as the\r\nquantity of that fell short, to increase it by mixing barley with it,\r\nand by these methods support their cavalry. But when not only the barley\r\nand fodder in these parts were consumed, and the herbs cut away, when\r\nthe leaves too were not to be found on the trees, the horses being\r\nalmost starved, Pompey thought he ought to make some attempt by a sally.\r\n\r\nLIX.--In the number of Caesar's cavalry were two Allobrogians, brothers,\r\nnamed Roscillus and Aegus, the sons of Abducillus, who for several years\r\npossessed the chief power in his own state; men of singular valour,\r\nwhose gallant services Caesar had found very useful in all his wars in\r\nGaul. To them, for these reasons, he had committed the offices of\r\ngreatest honour in their own country, and took care to have them chosen\r\ninto the senate at an unusual age, and had bestowed on them lands taken\r\nfrom the enemy, and large pecuniary rewards, and from being needy had\r\nmade them affluent. Their valour had not only procured them Caesar's\r\nesteem, but they were beloved by the whole army. But presuming on\r\nCaesar's friendship, and elated with the arrogance natural to a foolish\r\nand barbarous people, they despised their countrymen, defrauded their\r\ncavalry of their pay, and applied all the plunder to their own use.\r\nDispleased at this conduct, their soldiers went in a body to Caesar, and\r\nopenly complained of their ill usage; and to their other charges added,\r\nthat false musters were given in to Caesar, and the surcharged pay\r\napplied to their own use.\r\n\r\nLX.--Caesar, not thinking it a proper time to call them to account, and\r\nwilling to pardon many faults, on account of their valour, deferred the\r\nwhole matter, and gave them a private rebuke, for having made a traffic\r\nof their troops, and advised them to expect everything from his\r\nfriendship, and by his past favours to measure their future hopes. This,\r\nhowever, gave them great offence, and made them contemptible in the eyes\r\nof the whole army. Of this they became sensible, as well from the\r\nreproaches of others, as from the judgment of their own minds, and a\r\nconsciousness of guilt. Prompted then by shame, and perhaps imagining\r\nthat they were not liberated from trial, but reserved to a future day,\r\nthey resolved to break off from us, to put their fortune to a new\r\nhazard, and to make trial of new connections. And having conferred with\r\na few of their clients, to whom they could venture to entrust so base an\r\naction, they first attempted to assassinate Caius Volusenus, general of\r\nthe horse (as was discovered at the end of the war), that they might\r\nappear to have fled to Pompey after conferring an important service on\r\nhim. But when that appeared too difficult to put in execution, and no\r\nopportunity offered to accomplish it, they borrowed all the money they\r\ncould, as if they designed to make satisfaction and restitution for what\r\nthey had defrauded: and having purchased a great number of horses, they\r\ndeserted to Pompey along with those whom they had engaged in their plot.\r\n\r\nLXI.--As they were persons nobly descended and of liberal education, and\r\nhad come with a great retinue, and several cattle, and were reckoned men\r\nof courage, and had been in great esteem with Caesar, and as it was a\r\nnew and uncommon event, Pompey carried them round all his works, and\r\nmade an ostentatious show of them, for till that day, not a soldier,\r\neither horse or foot, had deserted from Caesar to Pompey, though there\r\nwere desertions almost every day from Pompey to Caesar: but more\r\ncommonly among the soldiers levied in Epirus and Aetolia, and in those\r\ncountries which were in Caesar's possession. But the brothers, having\r\nbeen acquainted with all things, either what was incomplete in our\r\nworks, or what appeared to the best judges of military matters to be\r\ndeficient, the particular times, the distance of places, and the various\r\nattention of the guards, according to the different temper and character\r\nof the officer who commanded the different posts, gave an exact account\r\nof all to Pompey.\r\n\r\nLXII.--Upon receiving this intelligence, Pompey, who had already formed\r\nthe design of attempting a sally, as before mentioned, ordered the\r\nsoldiers to make ozier coverings for their helmets, and to provide\r\nfascines. These things being prepared, he embarked on board small boats\r\nand row galleys by night, a considerable number of light infantry and\r\narchers, with all their fascines, and immediately after midnight, he\r\nmarched sixty cohorts drafted from the greater camp and the outposts, to\r\nthat part of our works which extended towards the sea, and were at the\r\nfarthest distance from Caesar's greater camp. To the same place he sent\r\nthe ships, which he had freighted with the fascines and light-armed\r\ntroops; and all the ships of war that lay at Dyrrachium; and to each he\r\ngave particular instructions: at this part of the lines Caesar had\r\nposted Lentulus Marcellinus, the quaestor, with the ninth legion, and as\r\nhe was not in a good state of health, Fulvius Costhumus was sent to\r\nassist him in the command.\r\n\r\nLXIII.--At this place, fronting the enemy, there was a ditch fifteen\r\nfeet wide, and a rampart ten feet high, and the top of the rampart was\r\nten feet in breadth. At an interval of six hundred feet from that there\r\nwas another rampart turned the contrary way, with the works lower. For\r\nsome days before, Caesar, apprehending that our men might be surrounded\r\nby sea, had made a double rampart there, that if he should be attacked\r\non both sides, he might have the means in defending himself. But the\r\nextent of the lines, and the incessant labour for so many days, because\r\nhe had enclosed a circuit of seventeen miles with his works, did not\r\nallow time to finish them. Therefore the transverse rampart which should\r\nmake a communication between the other two, was not yet completed. This\r\ncircumstance was known to Pompey, being told to him by the Allobrogian\r\ndeserters, and proved of great disadvantage to us. For when our cohorts\r\nof the ninth legion were on guard by the sea-side, Pompey's army arrived\r\nsuddenly by break of day, and their approach was a surprise to our men,\r\nand at the same time, the soldiers that came by sea cast their darts on\r\nthe front rampart; and the ditches were filled with fascines: and the\r\nlegionary soldiers terrified those that defended the inner rampart, by\r\napplying the scaling ladders, and by engines and weapons of all sorts,\r\nand a vast multitude of archers poured round upon them from every side.\r\nBesides, the coverings of oziers, which they had laid over their\r\nhelmets, were a great security to them against the blows of stones which\r\nwere the only weapons that our soldiers had. And therefore, when our men\r\nwere oppressed in every manner, and were scarcely able to make\r\nresistance, the defect in our works was observed, and Pompey's soldiers,\r\nlanding between the two ramparts, where the work was unfinished,\r\nattacked our men in the rear, and having beat them from both sides of\r\nthe fortification, obliged them to flee.\r\n\r\nLXIV.--Marcellinus, being informed of this disorder, detached some\r\ncohorts to the relief of our men, who seeing them flee from the camp,\r\nwere neither able to persuade them to rally at their approach, nor\r\nthemselves to sustain the enemy's charge. And in like manner, whatever\r\nadditional assistance was sent, was infected by the fears of the\r\ndefeated, and increased the terror and danger. For retreat was prevented\r\nby the multitude of the fugitives. In that battle, when the eagle-bearer\r\nwas dangerously wounded, and began to grow weak, having got sight of our\r\nhorse, he said to them, \"This eagle have I defended with the greatest\r\ncare for many years, at the hazard of my life, and now in my last\r\nmoments restore it to Caesar with the same fidelity. Do not, I conjure\r\nyou, suffer a dishonour to be sustained in the field, which never before\r\nhappened to Caesar's army, but deliver it safe into his hands.\" By this\r\naccident the eagle was preserved, but all the centurions of the first\r\ncohorts were killed, except the principal.\r\n\r\nLXV.--And now the Pompeians, after great havoc of our troops, were\r\napproaching Marcellinus's camp, and had struck no small terror into the\r\nrest of the cohorts, when Marcus Antonius, who commanded the nearest\r\nfort, being informed of what had happened, was observed descending from\r\nthe rising ground with twelve cohorts. His arrival checked the\r\nPompeians, and encouraged our men to recover from their extreme\r\naffright. And shortly after, Caesar having got notice by the smoke from\r\nall the forts, which was the usual signal on such occasions, drafted off\r\nsome cohorts from the outposts, and went to the scene of action. And\r\nhaving there learnt the loss he had sustained, and perceiving that\r\nPompey had forced our works, and had encamped along the coast, so that\r\nhe was at liberty to forage, and had a communication with his shipping,\r\nhe altered his plan for conducting the war, as his design had not\r\nsucceeded, and ordered a strong encampment to be made near Pompey.\r\n\r\nLXVI.--When this work was finished, Caesar's scouts observed that some\r\ncohorts, which to them appeared like a legion, were retired behind the\r\nwood, and were on their march to the old camp. The situation of the two\r\ncamps was as follows: a few days before, when Caesar's ninth legion had\r\nopposed a party of Pompey's troops, and were endeavouring to enclose\r\nthem, Caesar's troops formed a camp in that place. This camp joined a\r\ncertain wood, and was not above four hundred paces distant from the sea.\r\nAfterwards, changing his design for certain reasons, Caesar removed his\r\ncamp to a small distance beyond that place; and after a few days, Pompey\r\ntook possession of it, and added more extensive works, leaving the inner\r\nrampart standing, as he intended to keep several legions there. By this\r\nmeans, the lesser camp included within the greater, answered the purpose\r\nof a fort and citadel. He had also carried an entrenchment from the left\r\nangle of the camp to the river, about four hundred paces, that his\r\nsoldiers might have more liberty and less danger in fetching water. But\r\nhe too, changing his design for reasons not necessary to be mentioned,\r\nabandoned the place. In this condition the camp remained for several\r\ndays, the works being all entire.\r\n\r\nLXVII.--Caesar's scouts brought him word that the standard of a legion\r\nwas carried to this place. That the same thing was seen he was assured\r\nby those in the higher forts. This place was half a mile distant from\r\nPompey's new camp. Caesar, hoping to surprise this legion, and anxious\r\nto repair the loss sustained that day, left two cohorts employed in the\r\nworks to make an appearance of entrenching himself, and by a different\r\nroute, as privately as he could, with his other cohorts amounting to\r\nthirty-three, among which was the ninth legion, which had lost so many\r\ncenturions, and whose privates were greatly reduced in number, he\r\nmarched in two lines against Pompey's legion and his lesser camp. Nor\r\ndid this first opinion deceive him. For he reached the place before\r\nPompey could have notice of it; and though the works were strong, yet\r\nhaving made the attack with the left wing, which he commanded in person,\r\nhe obliged the Pompeians to quit the rampart in disorder. A barricade\r\nhad been raised before the gates, at which a short contest was\r\nmaintained, our men endeavouring to force their way in, and the enemy to\r\ndefend the camp; Titus Pulcio, by whose means we have related that Caius\r\nAntonius's army was betrayed, defending them with singular courage. But\r\nthe valour of our men prevailed, and having cut down the barricade, they\r\nfirst forced the greater camp, and after that the fort which was\r\nenclosed within it: and as the legion on its repulse had retired to\r\nthis, they slew several defending themselves there.\r\n\r\nLXVIII.--But Fortune, who exerts a powerful influence as well in other\r\nmatters, as especially in war, effects great changes from trifling\r\ncauses, as happened at this time. For the cohorts on Caesar's right\r\nwing, through ignorance of the place, followed the direction of that\r\nrampart, which ran along from the camp to the river, whilst they were in\r\nsearch of a gate, and imagined that it belonged to the camp. But when\r\nthey found that it led to the river, and that nobody opposed them, they\r\nimmediately climbed over the rampart, and were followed by all our\r\ncavalry.\r\n\r\nLXIX.--In the meantime Pompey, by the great delay which this occasioned,\r\nbeing informed of what had happened, marched with the fifth legion,\r\nwhich he called away from their work to support his party; and at the\r\nsame time his cavalry were advancing up to ours, and an army in order of\r\nbattle was seen at a distance by our men who had taken possession of the\r\ncamp, and the face of affairs was suddenly changed. For Pompey's legion,\r\nencouraged by the hope of speedy support, attempted to make a stand at\r\nthe Decuman gate, and made a bold charge on our men. Caesar's cavalry,\r\nwho had mounted the rampart by a narrow breach, being apprehensive of\r\ntheir retreat, were the first to flee. The right wing, which had been\r\nseparated from the left, observing the terror of the cavalry, to prevent\r\ntheir being overpowered within the lines, were endeavouring to retreat\r\nby the same way as they burst in; and most of them, lest they should be\r\nengaged in the narrow passes, threw themselves down a rampart ten feet\r\nhigh into the trenches; and the first being trodden to death, the rest\r\nprocured their safety and escaped over their bodies. The soldiers of the\r\nleft wing, perceiving from the rampart that Pompey was advancing, and\r\ntheir own friends fleeing, being afraid that they should be enclosed\r\nbetween the two ramparts, as they had an enemy both within and without,\r\nstrove to secure their retreat the same way they came. All was disorder,\r\nconsternation, and flight; insomuch that, when Caesar laid hold of the\r\ncolours of those who were running away, and desired them to stand, some\r\nleft their horses behind, and continued to run in the same manner;\r\nothers through fear even threw away their colours, nor did a single man\r\nface about.\r\n\r\nLXX.--In this calamity, the following favourable circumstance occurred\r\nto prevent the ruin of our whole army, viz., that Pompey suspecting an\r\nambuscade (because, as I suppose, the success had far exceeded his\r\nhopes, as he had seen his men a moment before fleeing from the camp),\r\ndurst not for some time approach the fortification; and that his horse\r\nwere retarded from pursuing, because the passes and gates were in\r\npossession of Caesar's soldiers. Thus a trifling circumstance proved of\r\ngreat importance to each party; for the rampart drawn from the camp to\r\nthe river, interrupted the progress and certainty of Caesar's victory,\r\nafter he had forced Pompey's camp. The same thing, by retarding the\r\nrapidity of the enemy's pursuit, preserved our army.\r\n\r\nLXXI.--In the two actions of this day, Caesar lost nine hundred and\r\nsixty rank and file, several Roman knights of distinction, Felginas\r\nTuticanus Gallus, a senator's son; Caius Felginas from Placentia; Aulus\r\nGravius from Puteoli; Marcus Sacrativir from Capua; and thirty-two\r\nmilitary tribunes and centurions. But the greatest part of all these\r\nperished without a wound, being trodden to death in the trenches, on the\r\nramparts and banks of the river by reason of the terror and flight of\r\ntheir own men. Pompey, after this battle, was saluted Imperator; this\r\ntitle he retained, and allowed himself to be addressed by it afterwards.\r\nBut neither in his letters to the senate, nor in the fasces, did he use\r\nthe laurel as a mark of honour. But Labienus, having obtained his\r\nconsent that the prisoners should be delivered up to him, had them all\r\nbrought out, as it appeared, to make a show of them, and that Pompey\r\nmight place a greater confidence in him who was a deserter; and calling\r\nthem fellow soldiers, and asking them in the most insulting manner\r\nwhether it was usual with veterans to flee, ordered them to be put to\r\ndeath in the sight of the whole army.\r\n\r\nLXXII.-Pompey's party were so elated with confidence and spirit at this\r\nsuccess, that they thought no more of the method of conducting the war,\r\nbut thought that they were already conquerors. They did not consider\r\nthat the smallness of our numbers, and the disadvantage of the place and\r\nthe confined nature of the ground occasioned by their having first\r\npossessed themselves of the camp, and the double danger both from within\r\nand without the fortifications, and the separation of the army into two\r\nparts, so that the one could not give relief to the other, were the\r\ncause of our defeat. They did not consider, in addition, that the\r\ncontest was not decided by a vigorous attack, nor a regular battle; and\r\nthat our men had suffered greater loss from their numbers and want of\r\nroom, than they had sustained from the enemy. In fine, they did not\r\nreflect on the common casualties of war; how trifling causes, either\r\nfrom groundless suspicions, sudden affright, or religious scruples, have\r\noftentimes been productive of considerable losses; how often an army has\r\nbeen unsuccessful either by the misconduct of the general, or the\r\noversight of a tribune; but as if they had proved victorious by their\r\nvalour, and as if no change could ever take place, they published the\r\nsuccess of the day throughout the world by reports and letters.\r\n\r\nLXXIII.--Caesar, disappointed in his first intentions, resolved to\r\nchange the whole plan of his operations. Accordingly, he at once called\r\nin all out-posts, gave over the siege, and collecting his army into one\r\nplace, addressed his soldiers and encouraged them \"not to be troubled at\r\nwhat had happened, nor to be dismayed at it, but to weigh their many\r\nsuccessful engagements against one disappointment, and that, too, a\r\ntrifling one. That they ought to be grateful to Fortune, through whose\r\nfavour they had recovered Italy without the effusion of blood; through\r\nwhose favour they had subdued the two Spains, though protected by a most\r\nwarlike people under the command of the most skilful and experienced\r\ngenerals: through whose favour they had reduced to submission the\r\nneighbouring states that abounded with corn: in fine, that they ought to\r\nremember with what success they had been all transported safe through\r\nblockading fleets of the enemy, which possessed not only the ports, but\r\neven the coasts: that if all their attempts were not crowned with\r\nsuccess, the defects of Fortune must be supplied by industry; and\r\nwhatever loss had been sustained, ought to be attributed rather to her\r\ncaprices than to any faults in him: that he had chosen a safe ground for\r\nthe engagement, that he had possessed himself of the enemy's camp; that\r\nhe had beaten them out, and overcome them when they offered resistance;\r\nbut whether their own terror or some mistake, or whether Fortune herself\r\nhad interrupted a victory almost secured and certain, they ought all now\r\nto use their utmost efforts to repair by their valour the loss which had\r\nbeen incurred; if they did so, their misfortunes would turn to their\r\nadvantage, as it happened at Gergovia, and those who feared to face the\r\nenemy would be the first to offer themselves to battle.\r\n\r\nLXXIV.--Having concluded his speech, he disgraced some standard-bearers,\r\nand reduced them to the ranks; for the whole army was seized with such\r\ngrief at their loss, and with such an ardent desire of repairing their\r\ndisgrace, that not a man required the command of his tribune or\r\ncenturion, but they imposed each on himself severer labours than usual\r\nas a punishment, and at the same time were so inflamed with eagerness to\r\nmeet the enemy, that the officers of the first rank, sensibly affected\r\nat their entreaties, were of opinion that they ought to continue in\r\ntheir present posts, and commit their fate to the hazard of a battle.\r\nBut, on the other hand, Caesar could not place sufficient confidence in\r\nmen so lately thrown into consternation, and thought he ought to allow\r\nthem time to recover their dejected spirits; and having abandoned his\r\nworks, he was apprehensive of being distressed for want of corn.\r\n\r\nLXXV.--Accordingly, suffering no time to intervene but what was\r\nnecessary for a proper attention to be paid to the sick and wounded, he\r\nsent on all his baggage privately in the beginning of the night from his\r\ncamp to Apollonia, and ordered them not to halt till they had performed\r\ntheir journey; and he detached one legion with them as a convoy. This\r\naffair being concluded, having retained only two legions in his camp; he\r\nmarched the rest of his army out at three o'clock in the morning by\r\nseveral gates, and sent them forward by the same route; and in a short\r\nspace after, that the military practice might be preserved, and his\r\nmarch known as late as possible, he ordered the signal for decamping to\r\nbe given; and setting out immediately, and following the rear of his own\r\narmy, he was soon out of sight of the camp. Nor did Pompey, as soon as\r\nhe had notice of his design, make any delay to pursue him; but with a\r\nview to surprise them whilst encumbered with baggage on their march, and\r\nnot yet recovered from their fright, he led his army out of his camp,\r\nand sent his cavalry on to retard our rear; but was not able to come up\r\nwith them, because Caesar had got far before him, and marched without\r\nbaggage. But when we reached the river Genusus, the banks being steep,\r\ntheir horse overtook our rear, and detained them by bringing them to\r\naction. To oppose whom, Caesar sent his horse, and intermixed with them\r\nabout four hundred of his advanced light troops, who attacked their\r\nhorse with such success, that having routed them all, and killed\r\nseveral, they returned without any loss to the main body.\r\n\r\nLXXVI.--Having performed the exact march which he had proposed that day,\r\nand having led his army over the river Genusus, Caesar posted himself in\r\nhis old camp opposite Asparagium; and kept his soldiers close within the\r\nentrenchments; and ordered the horse, who had been sent out under\r\npretence of foraging, to retire immediately into the camp, through the\r\nDecuman gate. Pompey, in like manner, having completed the same day's\r\nmarch, took post in his old camp at Asparagium; and his soldiers, as\r\nthey had no work (the fortifications being entire), made long\r\nexcursions, some to collect wood and forage; others, invited by the\r\nnearness of the former camp, laid up their arms in their tents, and\r\nquitted the entrenchments in order to bring what they had left behind\r\nthem, because the design of marching being adopted in a hurry, they had\r\nleft a considerable part of their waggons and luggage behind. Being thus\r\nincapable of pursuing, as Caesar had foreseen, about noon he gave the\r\nsignal for marching, led out his army, and doubling that day's march, he\r\nadvanced eight miles beyond Pompey's camp; who could not pursue him,\r\nbecause his troops were dispersed.\r\n\r\nLXXVII.--The next day Caesar sent his baggage forward early in the\r\nnight, and marched off himself immediately after the fourth watch: that\r\nif he should be under the necessity of risking an engagement, he might\r\nmeet a sudden attack with an army free from incumbrance. He did so for\r\nseveral days successively, by which means he was enabled to effect his\r\nmarch over the deepest rivers, and through the most intricate roads\r\nwithout any loss. For Pompey, after the first day's delay, and the\r\nfatigue which he endured for some days in vain, though he exerted\r\nhimself by forced marches, and was anxious to overtake us, who had got\r\nthe start of him, on the fourth day desisted from the pursuit, and\r\ndetermined to follow other measures.\r\n\r\nLXXVIII.--Caesar was obliged to go to Apollonia, to lodge his wounded,\r\npay his army, confirm his friends, and leave garrisons in the towns. But\r\nfor these matters, he allowed no more time than was necessary for a\r\nperson in haste. And being apprehensive for Domitius, lest he should be\r\nsurprised by Pompey's arrival, he hastened with all speed and\r\nearnestness to join him; for he planned the operations of the whole\r\ncampaign on these principles: that if Pompey should march after him, he\r\nwould be drawn off from the sea, and from those forces which he had\r\nprovided in Dyrrachium, and separated from his corn and magazines, and\r\nbe obliged to carry on the war on equal terms; but if he crossed over\r\ninto Italy, Caesar, having effected a junction with Domitius, would\r\nmarch through Illyricum to the relief of Italy; but if he endeavoured to\r\nstorm Apollonia and Oricum, and exclude him from the whole coast, he\r\nhoped, by besieging Scipio, to oblige him, of necessity, to come to his\r\nassistance. Accordingly, Caesar despatching couriers, writes to\r\nDomitius, and acquaints him with his wishes on the subject: and having\r\nstationed a garrison of four cohorts at Apollonia, one at Lissus, and\r\nthree at Oricum, besides those who were sick of their wounds, he set\r\nforward on his march through Epirus and Acarnania. Pompey, also,\r\nguessing at Caesar's design, determined to hasten to Scipio, that if\r\nCaesar should march in that direction, he might be ready to relieve him;\r\nbut that if Caesar should be unwilling to quit the sea-coast and\r\nCorcyra, because he expected legions and cavalry from Italy, he himself\r\nmight fall on Domitius with all his forces.\r\n\r\nLXXIX.--For these reasons, each of them studied despatch, that he might\r\nsuccour his friends, and not miss an opportunity of surprising his\r\nenemies. But Caesar's engagements at Apolloma had carried him aside from\r\nthe direct road. Pompey had taken the short road to Macedonia, through\r\nCandavia. To this was added another unexpected disadvantage, that\r\nDomitius, who for several days had been encamped opposite Scipio, had\r\nquitted that post for the sake of provisions, and had marched to\r\nHeraclea Sentica, a city subject to Candavia; so that fortune herself\r\nseemed to throw him in Pompey's way. Of this, Caesar was ignorant up to\r\nthis time. Letters likewise being sent by Pompey through all the\r\nprovinces and states, with an account of the action at Dyrrachium, very\r\nmuch enlarged and exaggerated beyond the real facts, a rumour had been\r\ncirculated, that Caesar had been defeated and forced to flee, and had\r\nlost almost all his forces. These reports had made the roads dangerous,\r\nand drawn off some states from his alliance: whence it happened, that\r\nthe messengers despatched by Caesar, by several different roads to\r\nDomitius, and by Domitius to Caesar, were not able by any means to\r\naccomplish their journey. But the Allobroges, who were in the retinue of\r\nAegus and Roscillus, and who had deserted to Pompey, having met on the\r\nroad a scouting party of Domitius; either from old acquaintance, because\r\nthey had served together in Gaul, or elated with vain glory, gave them\r\nan account of all that had happened, and informed them of Caesar's\r\ndeparture, and Pompey's arrival. Domitius, who was scarce four hours'\r\nmarch distant, having got intelligence from these, by the courtesy of\r\nthe enemy, avoided the danger, and met Caesar coming to join him at\r\nAeginium, a town on the confines of and opposite to Thessaly.\r\n\r\nLXXX.--The two armies being united, Caesar marched to Gomphi, which is\r\nthe first town of Thessaly on the road from Epirus. Now, the\r\nThessalians, a few months before, had of themselves sent ambassadors to\r\nCaesar, offering him the free use of everything in their power, and\r\nrequesting a garrison for their protection. But the report, already\r\nspoken of, of the battle at Dyrrachium, which it had exaggerated in many\r\nparticulars, had arrived before him. In consequence of which,\r\nAndrosthenes, the praetor of Thessaly, as he preferred to be the\r\ncompanion of Pompey's victory, rather than Caesar's associate in his\r\nmisfortunes, collected all the people, both slaves and freemen, from the\r\ncountry into the town and shut the gates, and despatched messengers to\r\nScipio and Pompey \"to come to his relief, that he could depend on the\r\nstrength of the town, if succour was speedily sent; but that it could\r\nnot withstand a long siege.\" Scipio, as soon as he received advice of\r\nthe departure of the armies from Dyrrachium, had marched with his\r\nlegions to Larissa: Pompey was not yet arrived near Thessaly. Caesar\r\nhaving fortified his camp, ordered scaling ladders and pent-houses to be\r\nmade for a sudden assault, and hurdles to be provided. As soon as they\r\nwere ready, he exhorted his soldiers, and told them of what advantage it\r\nwould be to assist them with all sorts of necessaries if they made\r\nthemselves masters of a rich and plentiful town: and, at the same time,\r\nto strike terror into other states by the example of this, and to effect\r\nthis with speed, before auxiliaries could arrive. Accordingly, taking\r\nadvantage of the unusual ardour of the soldiers, he began his assault on\r\nthe town at a little after three o'clock on the very day on which he\r\narrived, and took it, though defended with very high walls, before\r\nsunset, and gave it up to his army to plunder, and immediately decamped\r\nfrom before it, and marched to Metropolis, with such rapidity as to\r\noutstrip any messenger or rumour of the taking of Gomphi.\r\n\r\nLXXXI.--The inhabitants of Metropolis, at first influenced by the same\r\nrumours, followed the same measures, shut the gates and manned their\r\nwalls. But when they were made acquainted with the fate of the city of\r\nGomphi by some prisoners, whom Caesar had ordered to be brought up to\r\nthe walls, they threw open their gates. As he preserved them with the\r\ngreatest care, there was not a state in Thessaly (except Larissa, which\r\nwas awed by a strong army of Scipio's), but on comparing the fate of the\r\ninhabitants of Metropolis with the severe treatment of Gomphi, gave\r\nadmission to Caesar, and obeyed his orders. Having chosen a position\r\nconvenient for procuring corn, which was now almost ripe on the ground,\r\nhe determined there to wait Pompey's arrival, and to make it the centre\r\nof all his warlike operations.\r\n\r\nLXXXII.--Pompey arrived in Thessaly a few days after, and having\r\nharangued the combined army, returned thanks to his own men, and\r\nexhorted Scipio's soldiers, that as the victory was now secured, they\r\nshould endeavour to merit a part of the rewards and booty. And receiving\r\nall the legions into one camp, he shared his honours with Scipio,\r\nordered the trumpet to be sounded at his tent, and a pavilion to be\r\nerected for him. The forces of Pompey being thus augmented, and two such\r\npowerful armies united, their former expectations were confirmed, and\r\ntheir hopes of victory so much increased, that whatever time intervened\r\nwas considered as so much delay to their return into Italy: and whenever\r\nPompey acted with slowness and caution, they used to exclaim, that it\r\nwas the business only of a single day, but that he had a passion for\r\npower, and was delighted in having persons of consular and praetorian\r\nrank in the number of his slaves. And they now began to dispute openly\r\nabout rewards and priesthoods, and disposed of the consulate for several\r\nyears to come. Others put in their claims for the houses and properties\r\nof all who were in Caesar's camp, and in that council there was a warm\r\ndebate, whether Lucius Hirrus, who had been sent by Pompey against the\r\nParthians, should be admitted a candidate for the praetorship in his\r\nabsence at the next election; his friends imploring Pompey's honour to\r\nfulfil the engagements which he had made to him at his departure, that\r\nhe might not seem deceived through his authority: whilst others,\r\nembarked in equal labour and danger, pleaded that no individual ought to\r\nhave a preference before all the rest.\r\n\r\nLXXXIII.--Already Domitius, Scipio, and Lentulus Spinthur, in their\r\ndaily quarrels about Caesar's priesthood, openly abused each other in\r\nthe most scurrilous language. Lentulus urging the respect due to his\r\nage, Domitius boasting his interest in the city and his dignity, and\r\nScipio presuming on his alliance with Pompey. Attius Rufus charged\r\nLucius Afranius before Pompey with betraying the army in the action that\r\nhappened in Spain, and Lucius Domitius declared in the council that it\r\nwas his wish that, when the war should be ended, three billets should be\r\ngiven to all the senators who had taken part with them in the war, and\r\nthat they should pass sentence on every single person who had stayed\r\nbehind at Rome, or who had been within Pompey's garrisons and had not\r\ncontributed their assistance in the military operations; that by the\r\nfirst billet they should-have power to acquit, by the second to pass\r\nsentence of death, and by the third to impose a pecuniary fine. In\r\nshort, Pompey's whole army talked of nothing but the honours or sums of\r\nmoney which were to be their rewards, or of vengeance on their enemies;\r\nand never considered how they were to defeat their enemies, but in what\r\nmanner they should use their victory.\r\n\r\nLXXXIV.--Corn being provided, and his soldiers refreshed, and a\r\nsufficient time having elapsed since the engagement at Dyrrachium, when\r\nCaesar thought he had sufficiently sounded the disposition of his\r\ntroops, he thought that he ought to try whether Pompey had any intention\r\nor inclination to come to a battle. Accordingly he led his troops out of\r\nthe camp, and ranged them in order of battle, at first on their own\r\nground, and at a small distance from Pompey's camp: but afterwards for\r\nseveral days in succession he advanced from his own camp, and led them\r\nup to the hills on which Pompey's troops were posted, which conduct\r\ninspired his army every day with fresh courage. However he adhered to\r\nhis former purpose respecting his cavalry, for as he was by many degrees\r\ninferior in number, he selected the youngest and most active of the\r\nadvanced guard, and desired them to fight intermixed with the horse, and\r\nthey by constant practice acquired experience in this kind of battle. By\r\nthese means it was brought to pass that a thousand of his horse would\r\ndare, even on open ground, to stand against seven thousand of Pompey's,\r\nif occasion required, and would not be much terrified by their number.\r\nFor even on one of those days he was successful in a cavalry action, and\r\nkilled one of the two Allobrogians who had deserted to Pompey, as we\r\nbefore observed, and several others.\r\n\r\nLXXXV.--Pompey, because he was encamped on a hill, drew up his army at\r\nthe very foot of it, ever in expectation, as may be conjectured, that\r\nCaesar would expose himself to this disadvantageous situation. Caesar,\r\nseeing no likelihood of being able to bring Pompey to an action, judged\r\nit the most expedient method of conducting the war, to decamp from that\r\npost, and to be always in motion: with this hope, that by shifting his\r\ncamp and removing from place to place, he might be more conveniently\r\nsupplied with corn, and also, that by being in motion he might get some\r\nopportunity of forcing them to battle, and might by constant marches\r\nharass Pompey's army, which was not accustomed to fatigue. These matters\r\nbeing settled, when the signal for marching was given, and the tents\r\nstruck, it was observed that shortly before, contrary to his daily\r\npractice, Pompey's army had advanced farther than usual from his\r\nentrenchments, so that it appeared possible to come to an action on\r\nequal ground. Then Caesar addressed himself to his soldiers, when they\r\nwere at the gates of the camp, ready to march out. \"We must defer,\" says\r\nhe, \"our march at present, and set our thoughts on battle, which has\r\nbeen our constant wish; let us then meet the foe with resolute souls. We\r\nshall not hereafter easily find such an opportunity.\" He immediately\r\nmarched out at the head of his troops.\r\n\r\nLXXXVI.--Pompey also, as was afterward known, at the unanimous\r\nsolicitation of his friends, had determined to try the fate of a battle.\r\nFor he had even declared in council a few days before that, before the\r\nbattalions came to battle, Caesar's army would be put to the rout. When\r\nmost people expressed their surprise at it, \"I know,\" says he, \"that I\r\npromise a thing almost incredible; but hear the plan on which I proceed,\r\nthat you may march to battle with more confidence and resolution. I have\r\npersuaded our cavalry, and they have engaged to execute it, as soon as\r\nthe two armies have met, to attack Caesar's right wing on the flank, and\r\nenclosing their army on the rear, throw them into disorder, and put them\r\nto the rout, before we shall throw a weapon against the enemy. By this\r\nmeans we shall put an end to the war, without endangering the legions,\r\nand almost without a blow. Nor is this a difficult matter, as we far\r\noutnumber them in cavalry.\" At the same time he gave them notice to be\r\nready for battle on the day following, and since the opportunity which\r\nthey had so often wished for was now arrived, not to disappoint the\r\nopinion generally entertained of their experience and valour.\r\n\r\nLXXXVII.--After him Labienus spoke, as well to express his contempt of\r\nCaesar's forces, as to extol Pompey's scheme with the highest encomiums.\r\n\"Think not, Pompey,\" says he, \"that this is the army which conquered\r\nGaul and Germany; I was present at all those battles and do not speak at\r\nrandom on a subject to which I am a stranger: a very small part of that\r\narmy now remains, great numbers lost their lives, as must necessarily\r\nhappen in so many battles, many fell victims to the autumnal pestilence\r\nin Italy, many returned home, and many were left behind on the\r\ncontinent. Have you not heard that the cohorts at Brundisium are\r\ncomposed of invalids? The forces which you now behold, have been\r\nrecruited by levies lately made in Hither Spain, and the greater part\r\nfrom the colonies beyond the Po; moreover, the flower of the forces\r\nperished in the two engagements at Dyrrachium.\" Having so said, he took\r\nan oath, never to return to his camp unless victorious; and he\r\nencouraged the rest to do the like. Pompey applauded his proposal, and\r\ntook the same oath; nor did any person present hesitate to take it.\r\nAfter this had passed in the council they broke up full of hopes and\r\njoy, and in imagination anticipated victory; because they thought that\r\nin a matter of such importance, no groundless assertion could be made by\r\na general of such experience.\r\n\r\nLXXXVIII.--When Caesar had approached near Pompey's camp, he observed\r\nthat his army was drawn up in the following manner:--On the left wing\r\nwere the two legions delivered over by Caesar at the beginning of the\r\ndisputes in compliance with the senate's decree, one of which was called\r\nthe first, the other the third. Here Pompey commanded in person. Scipio\r\nwith the Syrian legions commanded the centre. The Cilician legion in\r\nconjunction with the Spanish cohorts, which we said were brought over by\r\nAfranius, were disposed on the right wing. These Pompey considered his\r\nsteadiest troops. The rest he had interspersed between the centre and\r\nthe wing, and he had a hundred and ten complete cohorts; these amounted\r\nto forty-five thousand men. He had besides two cohorts of volunteers,\r\nwho having received favours from him in former wars, flocked to his\r\nstandard: these were dispersed through his whole army. The seven\r\nremaining cohorts he had disposed to protect his camp, and the\r\nneighbouring forts. His right wing was secured by a river with steep\r\nbanks; for which reason he placed all his cavalry, archers, and\r\nslingers, on his left wing.\r\n\r\nLXXXIX.--Caesar, observing his former custom, had placed the tenth\r\nlegion on the right, the ninth on the left, although it was very much\r\nweakened by the battles at Dyrrachium. He placed the eighth legion so\r\nclose to the ninth, as to almost make one of the two, and ordered them\r\nto support one another. He drew up on the field eighty cohorts, making a\r\ntotal of twenty-two thousand men. He left two cohorts to guard the camp.\r\nHe gave the command of the left wing to Antonius, of the right to P.\r\nSulla, and of the centre to Cn. Domitius: he himself took his post\r\nopposite Pompey. At the same time, fearing, from the disposition of the\r\nenemy which we have previously mentioned, lest his right wing might be\r\nsurrounded by their numerous cavalry, he rapidly drafted a single cohort\r\nfrom each of the legions composing the third line, formed of them a\r\nfourth line, and opposed them to Pompey's cavalry, and, acquainting them\r\nwith his wishes, admonished them that the success of that day depended\r\non their courage. At the same time he ordered the third line, and the\r\nentire army not to charge without his command: that he would give the\r\nsignal whenever he wished them to do so.\r\n\r\nXC.--When he was exhorting his army to battle, according to the military\r\ncustom, and spoke to them of the favours that they had constantly\r\nreceived from him, he took especial care to remind them \"that he could\r\ncall his soldiers to witness the earnestness with which he had sought\r\npeace, the efforts that he had made by Vatinius to gain a conference\r\n[with Labienus], and likewise by Claudius to treat with Scipio, in what\r\nmanner he had exerted himself at Oricum, to gain permission from Libo to\r\nsend ambassadors; that he had been always reluctant to shed the blood of\r\nhis soldiers, and did not wish to deprive the republic of one or other\r\nof her armies.\" After delivering this speech, he gave by a trumpet the\r\nsignal to his soldiers, who were eagerly demanding it, and were very\r\nimpatient for the onset.\r\n\r\nXCI.--There was in Caesar's army a volunteer of the name of Crastinus,\r\nwho the year before had been first centurion of the tenth legion, a man\r\nof pre-eminent bravery. He, when the signal was given, says, \"Follow me,\r\nmy old comrades, and display such exertions in behalf of your general as\r\nyou have determined to do: this is our last battle, and when it shall be\r\nwon, he will recover his dignity, and we our liberty.\" At the same time\r\nhe looked back to Caesar, and said, \"General, I will act in such a\r\nmanner to-day, that you will feel grateful to me living or dead.\" After\r\nuttering these words he charged first on the right wing, and about one\r\nhundred and twenty chosen volunteers of the same century followed.\r\n\r\nXCII.--There was so much space left between the two lines, as sufficed\r\nfor the onset of the hostile armies: but Pompey had ordered his soldiers\r\nto await Caesar's attack, and not to advance from their position, or\r\nsuffer their line to be put into disorder. And he is said to have done\r\nthis by the advice of Caius Triarius, that the impetuosity of the charge\r\nof Caesar's soldiers might be checked, and their line broken, and that\r\nPompey's troops remaining in their ranks, might attack them while in\r\ndisorder; and he thought that the javelins would fall with less force if\r\nthe soldiers were kept in their ground, than if they met them in their\r\ncourse; at the same time he trusted that Caesar's soldiers, after\r\nrunning over double the usual ground, would become weary and exhausted\r\nby the fatigue. But to me Pompey seems to have acted without sufficient\r\nreason: for there is a certain impetuosity of spirit and an alacrity\r\nimplanted by nature in the hearts of all men, which is inflamed by a\r\ndesire to meet the foe. This a general should endeavour not to repress,\r\nbut to increase; nor was it a vain institution of our ancestors, that\r\nthe trumpets should sound on all sides, and a general shout be raised;\r\nby which they imagined that the enemy were struck with terror, and their\r\nown army inspired with courage.\r\n\r\nXCIII.--But our men, when the signal was given, rushed forward with\r\ntheir javelins ready to be launched, but perceiving that Pompey's men\r\ndid not run to meet their charge, having acquired experience by custom,\r\nand being practised in former battles, they of their own accord\r\nrepressed their speed, and halted almost midway, that they might not\r\ncome up with the enemy when their strength was exhausted, and after a\r\nshort respite they again renewed their course, and threw their javelins,\r\nand instantly drew their swords, as Caesar had ordered them. Nor did\r\nPompey's men fail in this crisis, for they received our javelins, stood\r\nour charge, and maintained their ranks: and having launched their\r\njavelins, had recourse to their swords. At the same time Pompey's horse,\r\naccording to their orders, rushed out at once from his left wing, and\r\nhis whole host of archers poured after them. Our cavalry did not\r\nwithstand their charge: but gave ground a little, upon which Pompey's\r\nhorse pressed them more vigorously, and began to file off in troops, and\r\nflank our army. When Caesar perceived this, he gave the signal to his\r\nfourth line, which he had formed of the six cohorts. They instantly\r\nrushed forward and charged Pompey's horse with such fury, that not a man\r\nof them stood; but all wheeling about, not only quitted their post, but\r\ngalloped forward to seek a refuge in the highest mountains. By their\r\nretreat the archers and slingers, being left destitute and defenceless,\r\nwere all cut to pieces. The cohorts, pursuing their success, wheeled\r\nabout upon Pompey's left wing, whilst his infantry still continued to\r\nmake battle, and attacked them in the rear.\r\n\r\nXCIV.--At the same time Caesar ordered his third line to advance, which\r\ntill then had not been engaged, but had kept their post. Thus, new and\r\nfresh troops having come to the assistance of the fatigued, and others\r\nhaving made an attack on their rear, Pompey's men were not able to\r\nmaintain their ground, but all fled, nor was Caesar deceived in his\r\nopinion that the victory, as he had declared in his speech to his\r\nsoldiers, must have its beginning from those six cohorts which he had\r\nplaced as a fourth line to oppose the horse. For by them the cavalry\r\nwere routed; by them the archers and slingers were cut to pieces; by\r\nthem the left wing of Pompey's army was surrounded, and obliged to be\r\nthe first to flee. But when Pompey saw his cavalry routed, and that part\r\nof his army on which he reposed his greatest hopes thrown into\r\nconfusion, despairing of the rest, he quitted the field, and retreated\r\nstraightway on horseback to his camp, and calling to the centurions,\r\nwhom he had placed to guard the praetorian gate, with a loud voice, that\r\nthe soldiers might hear: \"Secure the camp,\" says he, \"defend it with\r\ndiligence, if any danger should threaten it; I will visit the other\r\ngates, and encourage the guards of the camp.\" Having thus said, he\r\nretired into his tent in utter despair, yet anxiously waiting the issue.\r\n\r\nXCV.--Caesar having forced the Pompeians to flee into their\r\nentrenchment, and thinking that he ought not to allow them any respite\r\nto recover from their fright, exhorted his soldiers to take advantage of\r\nfortune's kindness, and to attack the camp. Though they were fatigued by\r\nthe intense heat, for the battle had continued till mid-day, yet, being\r\nprepared to undergo any labour, they cheerfully obeyed his command. The\r\ncamp was bravely defended by the cohorts which had been left to guard\r\nit, but with much more spirit by the Thracians and foreign auxiliaries.\r\nFor the soldiers who had fled for refuge to it from the field of battle,\r\naffrighted and exhausted by fatigue, having thrown away their arms and\r\nmilitary standards, had their thoughts more engaged on their further\r\nescape than on the defence of the camp. Nor could the troops who were\r\nposted on the battlements long withstand the immense number of our\r\ndarts, but fainting under their wounds, quitted the place, and under the\r\nconduct of their centurions and tribunes, fled, without stopping, to the\r\nhigh mountains which joined the camp.\r\n\r\nXCVI.--In Pompey's camp you might see arbours in which tables were laid,\r\na large quantity of plate set out, the floors of the tents covered with\r\nfresh sods, the tents of Lucius Lentulus and others shaded with ivy, and\r\nmany other things which were proofs of excessive luxury, and a\r\nconfidence of victory, so that it might readily be inferred that they\r\nhad no apprehensions of the issue of the day, as they indulged\r\nthemselves in unnecessary pleasures, and yet upbraided with luxury\r\nCaesar's army, distressed and suffering troops, who had always been in\r\nwant of common necessaries. Pompey, as soon as our men had forced the\r\ntrenches, mounting his horse, and stripping off his general's habit,\r\nwent hastily out of the back gate of the camp, and galloped with all\r\nspeed to Larissa. Nor did he stop there, but with the same despatch\r\ncollecting a few of his flying troops, and halting neither day nor\r\nnight, he arrived at the sea-side, attended by only thirty horse, and\r\nwent on board a victualling barque, often complaining, as we have been\r\ntold, that he had been so deceived in his expectation, that he was\r\nalmost persuaded that he had been betrayed by those from whom he had\r\nexpected victory, as they began the flight.\r\n\r\nXCVII.--Caesar having possessed himself of Pompey's camp, urged his\r\nsoldiers not to be too intent on plunder, and lose the opportunity of\r\ncompleting their conquest. Having obtained their consent, he began to\r\ndraw lines round the mountain. The Pompeians distrusting the position,\r\nas there was no water on the mountain, abandoned it, and all began to\r\nretreat towards Larissa; which Caesar perceiving, divided his troops,\r\nand ordering part of his legions to remain in Pompey's camp, sent back a\r\npart to his own camp, and taking four legions with him, went by a\r\nshorter road to intercept the enemy: and having marched six miles, drew\r\nup his army. But the Pompeians observing this, took post on a mountain\r\nwhose foot was washed by a river. Caesar having encouraged his troops,\r\nthough they were greatly exhausted by incessant labour the whole day,\r\nand night was now approaching, by throwing up works cut off the\r\ncommunication between the river and the mountain, that the enemy might\r\nnot get water in the night. As soon as the work was finished, they sent\r\nambassadors to treat about a capitulation. A few senators who had\r\nespoused that party, made their escape by night.\r\n\r\nXCVIII.--At break of day, Caesar ordered all those who had taken post on\r\nthe mountain, to come down from the higher grounds into the plain, and\r\npile their arms. When they did this without refusal, and with\r\noutstretched arms, prostrating themselves on the ground, with tears,\r\nimplored his mercy: he comforted them and bade them rise, and having\r\nspoken a few words of his own clemency to alleviate their fears, he\r\npardoned them all, and gave orders to his soldiers that no injury should\r\nbe done to them, and nothing taken from them. Having used this\r\ndiligence, he ordered the legions in his camp to come and meet him, and\r\nthose which were, with him to take their turn of rest, and go back to\r\nthe camp; and the same day went to Larissa.\r\n\r\nXCIX.--In that battle, no more than two hundred privates were missing,\r\nbut Caesar lost about thirty centurions, valiant officers. Crastinus,\r\nalso, of whom mention was made before, fighting most courageously, lost\r\nhis life by the wound of a sword in the mouth; nor was that false which\r\nhe declared when marching to battle: for Caesar entertained the highest\r\nopinion of his behaviour in that battle, and thought him highly\r\ndeserving of his approbation. Of Pompey's army, there fell about fifteen\r\nthousand; but upwards of twenty-four thousand were made prisoners: for\r\neven the cohorts which were stationed in the forts, surrendered to\r\nSylla. Several others took shelter in the neighbouring states. One\r\nhundred and eighty stands of colours, and nine eagles, were brought to\r\nCaesar. Lucius Domitius, fleeing from the camp to the mountains, his\r\nstrength being exhausted by fatigue, was killed by the horse.\r\n\r\nC.--About this time, Decimus Laelius arrived with his fleet at\r\nBrundisium and in the same manner as Libo had done before, possessed\r\nhimself of an island opposite the harbour of Brundisium. In like manner,\r\nValimus, who was then governor of Brundisium, with a few decked barques,\r\nendeavoured to entice Laelius's fleet, and took one five-benched galley\r\nand two smaller vessels that had ventured farther than the rest into a\r\nnarrow part of the harbour: and likewise disposing the horse along the\r\nshore, strove to prevent the enemy from procuring fresh water. But\r\nLaelius having chosen a more convenient season of the year for his\r\nexpedition, supplied himself with water brought in transports from\r\nCorcyra and Dyrrachium, and was not deterred from his purpose; and till\r\nhe had received advice of the battle in Thessaly, he could not be forced\r\neither by the disgrace of losing his ships, or by the want of\r\nnecessaries, to quit the port and islands.\r\n\r\nCI.--Much about the same time, Cassius arrived in Sicily with a fleet of\r\nSyrians, Phoenicians, and Cilicians: and as Caesar's fleet was divided\r\ninto two parts, Publius Sulpicius the praetor commanding one division at\r\nVibo near the straits, Pomponius the other at Messana, Cassius got into\r\nMessana with his fleet before Pomponius had notice of his arrival, and\r\nhaving found him in disorder, without guards or discipline, and the wind\r\nbeing high and favourable, he filled several transports with fir, pitch,\r\nand tow, and other combustibles, and sent them against Pomponius's\r\nfleet, and set fire to all his ships, thirty-five in number, twenty of\r\nwhich were armed with beaks: and this action struck such terror, that\r\nthough there was a legion in garrison at Messana, the town with\r\ndifficulty held out, and had not the news of Caesar's victory been\r\nbrought at that instant by the horse stationed along the coast, it was\r\ngenerally imagined that it would have been lost, but the town was\r\nmaintained till the news arrived very opportunely; and Cassius set sail\r\nfrom thence to attack Sulpicius's fleet at Vibo, and our ships being\r\nmoored to the land, to strike the same terror, he acted in the same\r\nmanner as before. The wind being favourable, he sent into the port about\r\nforty ships provided with combustibles, and the flame catching on both\r\nsides, five ships were burnt to ashes. And when the fire began to spread\r\nwider by the violence of the wind, the soldiers of the veteran legions,\r\nwho had been left to guard the fleet, being considered as invalids,\r\ncould not endure the disgrace, but of themselves went on board the ships\r\nand weighed anchor, and having attacked Cassius's fleet, captured two\r\nfive-banked galleys, in one of which was Cassius himself; but he made\r\nhis escape by taking to a boat. Two three-banked galleys were taken\r\nbesides. Intelligence was shortly after received of the action in\r\nThessaly, so well authenticated, that the Pompeians themselves gave\r\ncredit to it; for they had hitherto believed it a fiction of Caesar's\r\nlieutenants and friends. Upon which intelligence Cassius departed with\r\nhis fleet from that coast.\r\n\r\nCII.--Caesar thought he ought to postpone all business and pursue\r\nPompey, whithersoever he should retreat; that he might not be able to\r\nprovide fresh forces, and renew the war; he therefore marched on every\r\nday, as far as his cavalry were able to advance, and ordered one legion\r\nto follow him by shorter journeys. A proclamation was issued by Pompey\r\nat Amphipolis, that all the young men of that province, Grecians and\r\nRoman citizens, should take the military oath; but whether he issued it\r\nwith an intention of preventing suspicion, and to conceal as long as\r\npossible his design of fleeing farther, or to endeavour to keep\r\npossession of Macedonia by new levies, if nobody pursued him, it is\r\nimpossible to judge. He lay at anchor one night, and calling together\r\nhis friends in Amphipolis, and collecting a sum of money for his\r\nnecessary expenses, upon advice of Caesar's approach, set sail from that\r\nplace, and arrived in a few days at Mitylene. Here he was detained two\r\ndays, and having added a few galleys to his fleet he went to Cilicia,\r\nand thence to Cyprus. There he is informed that, by the consent of all\r\nthe inhabitants of Antioch and Roman citizens who traded there, the\r\ncastle had been seized to shut him out of the town; and that messengers\r\nhad been despatched to all those who were reported to have taken refuge\r\nin the neighbouring states, that they should not come to Antioch; that\r\nif they did that, it would be attended with imminent danger to their\r\nlives. The same thing had happened to Lucius Lentulus, who had been\r\nconsul the year before, and to Publius Lentulus a consular senator, and\r\nto several others at Rhodes, who having followed Pompey in his flight,\r\nand arrived at the island, were not admitted into the town or port; and\r\nhaving received a message to leave that neighbourhood, set sail much\r\nagainst their will; for the rumour of Caesar's approach had now reached\r\nthose states.\r\n\r\nCIII.--Pompey, being informed of these proceedings, laid aside his\r\ndesign of going to Syria, and having taken the public money from the\r\nfarmers of the revenue, and borrowed more from some private friends, and\r\nhaving put on board his ships a large quantity of brass for military\r\npurposes, and two thousand armed men, whom he partly selected from the\r\nslaves of the tax farmers, and partly collected from the merchants, and\r\nsuch persons as each of his friends thought fit on this occasion, he\r\nsailed for Pelusium. It happened that king Ptolemy, a minor, was there\r\nwith a considerable army, engaged in war with his sister Cleopatra, whom\r\na few months before, by the assistance of his relations and friends, he\r\nhad expelled from the kingdom; and her camp lay at a small distance from\r\nhis. To him Pompey applied to be permitted to take refuge in Alexandria,\r\nand to be protected in his calamity by his powerful assistance, in\r\nconsideration of the friendship and amity which had subsisted between\r\nhis father and him. But Pompey's deputies having executed their\r\ncommission, began to converse with less restraint with the king's\r\ntroops, and to advise them to act with friendship to Pompey, and not to\r\nthink meanly of his bad fortune. In Ptolemy's army were several of\r\nPompey's soldiers, of whom Gabinius had received the command in Syria,\r\nand had brought them over to Alexandria, and at the conclusion of the\r\nwar had left with Ptolemy the father of the young king.\r\n\r\nCIV.--The king's friends, who were regents of the kingdom during the\r\nminority, being informed of these things, either induced by fear, as\r\nthey afterwards declared, lest Pompey should corrupt the king's army,\r\nand seize on Alexandria and Egypt; or despising his bad fortune, as in\r\nadversity friends commonly change to enemies, in public gave a\r\nfavourable answer to his deputies, and desired him to come to the king;\r\nbut secretly laid a plot against him, and despatched Achillas, captain\r\nof the king's guards, a man of singular boldness, and Lucius Septimius a\r\nmilitary tribune to assassinate him. Being kindly addressed by them, and\r\ndeluded by an acquaintance with Septimius, because in the war with the\r\npirates the latter had commanded a company under him, he embarked in a\r\nsmall boat with a few attendants, and was there murdered by Achillas and\r\nSeptimius. In like manner, Lucius Lentulus was seized by the king's\r\norder, and put to death in prison.\r\n\r\nCV.--When Caesar arrived in Asia, he found that Titus Ampius had\r\nattempted to remove the money from the temple of Diana at Ephesus; and\r\nfor this purpose had convened all the senators in the province that he\r\nmight have them to attest the sum, but was interrupted by Caesar's\r\narrival, and had made his escape. Thus, on two occasions, Caesar saved\r\nthe money of Ephesus. It was also remarked at Elis, in the temple of\r\nMinerva, upon calculating and enumerating the days, that on the very day\r\non which Caesar had gained his battle, the image of Victory which was\r\nplaced before Minerva, and faced her statue, turned about towards the\r\nportal and entrance of the temple; and the same day, at Antioch in\r\nSyria, such a shout of an army and sound of trumpets was twice heard,\r\nthat the citizens ran in arms to the walls. The same thing happened at\r\nPtolemais; a sound of drums too was heard at Pergamus, in the private\r\nand retired parts of the temple, into which none but the priests are\r\nallowed admission, and which the Greeks call Adyta (the inaccessible),\r\nand likewise at Tralles, in the temple of Victory, in which there stood\r\na statue consecrated to Caesar; a palm-tree at that time was shown that\r\nhad sprouted up from the pavement, through the joints of the stones, and\r\nshot up above the roof.\r\n\r\nCVI.--After a few days' delay in Asia, Caesar, having heard that Pompey\r\nhad been seen in Cyprus, and conjecturing that he had directed his\r\ncourse into Egypt, on account of his connection with that kingdom, set\r\nout for Alexandria with two legions (one of which he ordered to follow\r\nhim from Thessaly, the other he called in from Achaia, from Fufius, the\r\nlieutenant-general) and with eight hundred horse, ten ships of war from\r\nRhodes, and a few from Asia. These legions amounted but to three\r\nthousand two hundred men; the rest, disabled by wounds received in\r\nvarious battles, by fatigue and the length of their march, could not\r\nfollow him. But Caesar, relying on the fame of his exploits; did not\r\nhesitate to set forward with a feeble force, and thought that he would\r\nbe secure in any place. At Alexandria he was informed of the death of\r\nPompey: and at his landing there, heard a cry among the soldiers whom\r\nthe king had left to garrison the town, and saw a crowd gathering\r\ntowards him, because the fasces were carried before him; for this the\r\nwhole multitude thought an infringement of the king's dignity. Though\r\nthis tumult was appeased, frequent disturbances were raised for several\r\ndays successively, by crowds of the populace, and a great many of his\r\nsoldiers were killed in all parts of the city.\r\n\r\nCVIL--Having observed this, he ordered other legions to be brought to\r\nhim from Asia, which he had made up out of Pompey's soldiers; for he was\r\nhimself detained against his will, by the etesian winds, which are\r\ntotally unfavourable to persons on a voyage from Alexandria. In the\r\nmeantime, considering that the disputes of the princes belonged to the\r\njurisdiction of the Roman people, and of him as consul, and that it was\r\na duty more incumbent on him, as in his former consulate a league had\r\nbeen made with Ptolemy the late king, under sanction both of a law, and\r\na decree of the senate, he signified that it was his pleasure, that king\r\nPtolemy, and his sister Cleopatra, should disband their armies, and\r\ndecide their disputes in his presence by justice, rather than by the\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nCVIII.--A eunuch named Pothinus, the boy's tutor, was regent of the\r\nkingdom on account of his youthfulness. He at first began to complain\r\namongst his friends, and to express his indignation, that the king\r\nshould be summoned to plead his cause: but afterwards, having prevailed\r\non some of those whom he had made acquainted with his views to join him,\r\nhe secretly called the army away from Pelusium to Alexandria, and\r\nappointed Achillas, already spoken of, commander-in-chief of the forces.\r\nHim he encouraged and animated by promises both in his own and the\r\nking's name, and instructed him both by letters and messages how he\r\nshould act. By the will of Ptolemy the father, the elder of his two sons\r\nand the more advanced in years of his two daughters were declared his\r\nheirs, and for the more effectual performance of his intention, in the\r\nsame will he conjured the Roman people by all the gods, and by the\r\nleague which he had entered into at Rome, to see his will executed. One\r\nof the copies of his will was conveyed to Rome by his ambassadors to be\r\ndeposited in the treasury, but the public troubles preventing it, it was\r\nlodged with Pompey: another was left sealed up, and kept at Alexandria.\r\n\r\nCIX.--Whilst these things were debated before Caesar, and he was very\r\nanxious to settle the royal disputes as a common friend and arbitrator;\r\nnews was brought on a sudden that the king's army and all his cavalry\r\nwere on their march to Alexandria. Caesar's forces were by no means so\r\nstrong that he could trust to them, if he had occasion to hazard a\r\nbattle without the town. His only resource was to keep within the town\r\nin the most convenient places, and get information of Achillas's\r\ndesigns. However he ordered his soldiers to repair to their arms; and\r\nadvised the king to send some of his friends, who had the greatest\r\ninfluence, as deputies to Achillas and to signify his royal pleasure.\r\nDioscorides and Serapion, the persons sent by him, who had both been\r\nambassadors at Rome, and had been in great esteem with Ptolemy the\r\nfather, went to Achillas. But as soon as they appeared in his presence,\r\nwithout hearing them, or learning the occasion of their coming, he\r\nordered them to be seized and put to death. One of them, after receiving\r\na wound, was taken up and carried off by his attendants as dead: the\r\nother was killed on the spot. Upon this, Caesar took care to secure the\r\nking's person, both supposing that the king's name would have great\r\ninfluence with his subjects, and to give the war the appearance of the\r\nscheme of a few desperate men, rather than of having been begun by the\r\nking's consent.\r\n\r\nCX.--The forces under Achillas did not seem despicable, either for\r\nnumber, spirit, or military experience; for he had twenty thousand men\r\nunder arms. They consisted partly of Gabinius's soldiers, who were now\r\nbecome habituated to the licentious mode of living at Alexandria, and\r\nhad forgotten the name and discipline of the Roman people, and had\r\nmarried wives there, by whom the greatest part of them had children. To\r\nthese was added a collection of highwaymen and free-booters, from Syria,\r\nand the province of Cilicia, and the adjacent countries. Besides several\r\nconvicts and transports had been collected: for at Alexandria all our\r\nrunaway slaves were sure of finding protection for their persons on the\r\ncondition that they should give in their names, and enlist as soldiers:\r\nand if any of them was apprehended by his master, he was rescued by a\r\ncrowd of his fellow soldiers, who being involved in the same guilt,\r\nrepelled, at the hazard of their lives, every violence offered to any of\r\ntheir body. These by a prescriptive privilege of the Alexandrian army,\r\nused to demand the king's favourites to be put to death, pillage the\r\nproperties of the rich to increase their pay, invest the king's palace,\r\nbanish some from the kingdom, and recall others from exile. Besides\r\nthese, there were two thousand horse, who had acquired the skill of\r\nveterans by being in several wars in Alexandria. These had restored\r\nPtolemy the father to his kingdom, had killed Bibulus's two sons; and\r\nhad been engaged in war with the Egyptians; such was their experience in\r\nmilitary affairs.\r\n\r\nCXI.--Full of confidence in his troops, and despising the small number\r\nof Caesar's soldiers, Achillas seized Alexandria, except that part of\r\nthe town which Caesar occupied with his troops. At first he attempted to\r\nforce the palace; but Caesar had disposed his cohorts through the\r\nstreets, and repelled his attack. At the same time there was an action\r\nat the port: where the contest was maintained with the greatest\r\nobstinacy. For the forces were divided, and the fight maintained in\r\nseveral streets at once, and the enemy endeavoured to seize with a\r\nstrong party the ships of war; of which fifty had been sent to Pompey's\r\nassistance, but after the battle in Thessaly had returned home. They\r\nwere all of either three or five banks of oars, well equipped and\r\nappointed with every necessary for a voyage. Besides these, there were\r\ntwenty-two vessels with decks, which were usually kept at Alexandria, to\r\nguard the port. If they made themselves masters of these, Caesar being\r\ndeprived of his fleet, they would have the command of the port and whole\r\nsea, and could prevent him from procuring provisions and auxiliaries.\r\nAccordingly that spirit was displayed, which ought to be displayed when\r\nthe one party saw that a speedy victory depended on the issue, and the\r\nother their safety. But Caesar gained the day, and set fire to all those\r\nships, and to others which were in the docks, because he could not guard\r\nso many places with so small a force; and immediately he conveyed some\r\ntroops to the Pharos by his ships.\r\n\r\nCXIL--The Pharos is a tower on an island, of prodigious height, built\r\nwith amazing works, and takes its name from the island. This island\r\nlying over against Alexandria forms a harbour; but on the upper side it\r\nis connected with the town by a narrow way eight hundred paces in\r\nlength, made by piles sunk in the sea, and by a bridge. In this island\r\nsome of the Egyptians have houses, and a village as large as a town; and\r\nwhatever ships from any quarter, either through mistaking the channel,\r\nor by the storm, have been driven from their course upon the coast, they\r\nconstantly plunder like pirates. And without the consent of those who\r\nare masters of the Pharos, no vessels can enter the harbour, on account\r\nof its narrowness. Caesar being greatly alarmed on this account, whilst\r\nthe enemy were engaged in battle, landed his soldiers, seized the\r\nPharos, and placed a garrison in it. By this means he gained this point,\r\nthat he could be supplied without danger with corn and auxiliaries: for\r\nhe sent to all the neighbouring countries, to demand supplies. In other\r\nparts of the town, they fought so obstinately, that they quitted the\r\nfield with equal advantage, and neither were beaten (in consequence of\r\nthe narrowness of the passes); and a few being killed on both sides,\r\nCaesar secured the most necessary posts, and fortified them in the\r\nnight. In this quarter of the town was a wing of the king's palace, in\r\nwhich Caesar was lodged on his first arrival, and a theatre adjoining\r\nthe house which served as for citadel, and commanded an avenue to the\r\nport and other docks. These fortifications he increased during the\r\nsucceeding days, that he might have them before him as a rampart, and\r\nnot be obliged to fight against his will. In the meantime Ptolemy's\r\nyounger daughter, hoping the throne would become vacant, made her escape\r\nfrom the palace to Achillas, and assisted him in prosecuting the war.\r\nBut they soon quarrelled about the command, which circumstance enlarged\r\nthe presents to the soldiers, for each endeavoured by great sacrifices\r\nto secure their affection. Whilst the enemy was thus employed, Pothinus,\r\ntutor to the young king, and regent of the kingdom, who was in Caesar's\r\npart of the town, sent messengers to Achillas, and encouraged him not to\r\ndesist from his enterprise, nor to despair of success; but his\r\nmessengers being discovered and apprehended, he was put to death by\r\nCaesar. Such was the commencement of the Alexandrian war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\nN.B. The numerals refer to the book, the figures to the chapter.

Egypt,\r\nproperly so called, may be described as consisting of the long and\r\nnarrow valley which follows the course of the Nile from Syene\r\n(_Assooan_) to _Cairo,_ near the site of the ancient Memphis. The name\r\nby which this country is known to Europeans comes from the Greeks, some\r\nof whose writers inform us that it received this appellation from\r\nAegyptus, son of Belus, it having been previously called Aeria. In the\r\nHebrew scriptures it is called Mitsraim, and also Matsor and Harets\r\nCham; of these names, however, the first is the one most commonly\r\nemployed\r\n\r\nAemilia Via, a Roman road in Italy, from Rimini to Aquileia, and from\r\nPisa to Dertona\r\n\r\nAet[=o]lia, a country of Greece, _Despotato;_ recovered from Pompey by\r\nthe partisans of Caesar, C. iii. 35\r\n\r\nAfr[=a]nius, Pompey's lieutenant, his exploits in conjunction with\r\nPetreius, C. i. 38; resolves to carry the war into Celtiberia, _ibid_.\r\n61; surrenders to Caesar, _ibid_. 84\r\n\r\nAfr[)i]ca, one of the four great continents into which the earth is\r\ndivided; the name seems to have been originally applied by the Romans to\r\nthe country around Carthage, the first part of the continent with which\r\nthey became acquainted, and is said to have been derived from a small\r\nCarthaginian district on the northern coast, called _Frigi._ Hence, even\r\nwhen the name had become applied to the whole continent, there still\r\nremained in Roman geography the district of Africa Proper, on the\r\nMediterranean coast, corresponding to the modem kingdom of _Tunis,_ with\r\npart of that of _Tripoli_\r\n\r\nAgend[)i]cum, a city of the Senones, _Sens_; Caesar quarters four\r\nlegions there, G. vi. 44; Labienus leaves his baggage in it under a\r\nguard of new levies, and sets out for Lutetia, G. vii. 57\r\n\r\nAlba, a town of Latium, in Italy, _Albano_; Domitius levies troops in\r\nthat neighbourhood, C. i. 15\r\n\r\nAlb[=i]ci, a people of Gaul, unknown; some make them the same with the\r\n_Vivarois_; taken into the service of the Marseillians, C. i. 34\r\n\r\nAlbis, the _Elbe,_ a large and noble river in Germany, which has its\r\nsource in the Giant's Mountains in Silesia, on the confines of Bohemia,\r\nand passing through Bohemia, Upper and Lower Saxony, falls into the\r\nNorth Sea at Ritzbuttel, about sixty miles below Hamburg\r\n\r\nAlces, a species of animals somewhat resembling an elk, to be found in\r\nthe Hercynian forests, C. vi. 27\r\n\r\nAlemanni, or Alamanni, a name assumed by a confederacy of German tribes,\r\nsituated between the Neckar and the Upper Rhine, who united to resist\r\nthe encroachments of the Roman power. According to Mannert, they derived\r\ntheir origin from the shattered remains of the army of Ariovistus\r\nretired, after the defeat and death of their leader, to the mountainous\r\ncountry of the Upper Rhine. After their overthrow by Clovis, king of the\r\nSalian Franks, they ceased to exist as one nation, and were dispersed\r\nover Gaul, Switzerland, and Nether Italy. From them L'Allemagne, the\r\nFrench name for Germany, is derived\r\n\r\nAlemannia, the country inhabited by the Alemanni\r\n\r\nAlesia, or Alexia, a town of the Mandubians, _Alise_; Caesar shuts up\r\nVercingetorix there, C. vii. 68; surrounds it with lines of\r\ncircumvallation and contravallation, _ibid_. 69, 72; obliges it to\r\nsurrender, _ibid_. 89\r\n\r\nAlexandr[=i]a, a city of Egypt, _Scanderia_.

The name, Allobroges, means highlanders, and is derived from\r\nAl, \"high,\" and Broga, \"land.\" They are supposed to be disaffected to\r\nthe Romans, G. i. 6; complain to Caesar of the ravages of the\r\nHelvetians, _ibid_. 11\r\n\r\nAlps, a ridge of high mountains, which separates France and Germany from\r\nItaly. That part of them which separates Dauphiny from Piedmont was\r\ncalled the Cottian Alps. Their name is derived from their height, Alp\r\nbeing an old Celtic appellation for \"a lofty mountain\"; Caesar crosses\r\nthem with five legions, G. i. 10; sends Galba to open a free passage\r\nover them to the Roman merchants, G. iii. 1\r\n\r\nAlsati[)a], a province of Germany, in the upper circle of the Rhine,\r\n_Alsace_\r\n\r\nAmagetobr[)i]a, a city of Gaul, unknown; famous for a defeat of the\r\nGauls there by Ariovistus, G. i. 31\r\n\r\nAmant[)i]a, a town in Macedonia, _Porto Raguseo_; it submits to Caesar,\r\nand sends ambassadors to know his pleasure, C. iii. 12\r\n\r\nAm[=a]nus, a mountain of Syria, _Alma Daghy,_ near which Scipio sustains\r\nsome losses, C. iii. 31\r\n\r\nAm[=a]ni Pylae, or Am[=a]nicae Portae, _Straits of Scanderona_\r\n\r\nAmbarri, a people of Gaul, uncertain; they complain to Caesar of the\r\nravages committed in their territories by the Helvetii, G. i. 11\r\n\r\nAmbialites, a people of Gaul, of _Lamballe in Bretagne_.

It is\r\nsupposed to derive its name from the Greek word [Greek: agkon], an angle\r\nor elbow, on account of the angular form of the promontory on which it\r\nis built. The foundation of Ancona is ascribed by Strabo to some\r\nSyracusans, who were fleeing from the tyranny of Dionysius. Livy speaks\r\nof it as a naval station of great importance in the wars of Rome with\r\nthe Illyrians. We find it occupied by Caesar (C. i. 2) shortly after\r\ncrossing the Rubicon; Caesar takes possession of it with a garrison of\r\none cohort, C. i. 11\r\n\r\nAndes, _Angers_, in France, the capital of the duchy of Anjou\r\n\r\nAndes, a people of Gaul, the ancient inhabitants of the duchy of Anjou;\r\nCaesar puts his troops into winter quarters among them, G. ii. 35\r\n\r\nAndomad[=u]num Ling[)o]num, a large and ancient city of Champagne, at\r\nthe source of the river Marne, _Langres_\r\n\r\nAnglesey (Mona), an island situated between Britain and Ireland, where\r\nthe night, during the winter, is said to be a month long, G. v. 13\r\n\r\nAngrivarii, an ancient people of Lower Germany, who dwelt between the\r\nEms and the Weser, below the Lippe\r\n\r\nAnsivarii, see _Ancibarii_\r\n\r\nAntioch[=i]a, _Antachia_, an ancient and famous city, once the capital\r\nof Syria, or rather of the East. It is situate on two rivers, the\r\nOrontes and the Phaspar, not far from the Mediterranean; refuses to\r\nadmit the fugitives after the battle of Pharsalia, C. iii. 102\r\n\r\nAnt[=o]nius (Mark Antony), Caesar's lieutenant, G. vii. i i; quaestor,\r\nG. viii. 2; governor of Brundusium, C. iii. 24; his standing for that\r\npriesthood, G. vii. 50; obliges Libo to raise the siege of Brundusium,\r\nC. iii. 24; and in conjunction with Kalenus transports Caesar's troops\r\nto Greece, _ibid_. 26\r\n\r\nApam[=e]a, _Apami_, a city of Bithynia, built by Nicomedes, the son of\r\nPrusias\r\n\r\nApennine Mountains, a large chain of mountains, branching off from the\r\nMaritime Alps, in the neighbourhood of Genoa, running diagonally from\r\nthe Ligurian Gulf to the Adriatic, in the vicinity of Ancona; from which\r\nit continues nearly parallel with the latter gulf, as far as the\r\npromontory of Garg[=a]nus, and again inclines to Mare Inf[)e]rum, till\r\nit finally terminates in the promontory of Leucopetra, near Rhegium. The\r\netymology of the name given to these mountains must be traced to the\r\nCeltic, and appears to combine two terms of that language nearly\r\nsynonymous, Alp, or Ap, \"a high mountain,\" and Penn, \"a summit\"\r\n\r\nApoll[=o]n[)i]a, a city of Macedonia, _Piergo_. Pompey resolves to\r\nwinter there, C. iii. 5; Caesar makes himself master of it, _ibid_. iii.\r\n12\r\n\r\nAppia Via, the Appian road which led from Rome to Campania, and from the\r\nsea to Brundusium. It was made, as Livy informs us, by the censor,\r\nAppius Caecus, A.U.C. 442, and was, in the first instance, only laid\r\ndown as far as Capua, a distance of about 125 miles. It was subsequently\r\ncarried on to Beneventum, and finally to Brundusium. According to\r\nEustace (_Classical Tour_, vol. iii.), such parts of the Appian Way as\r\nhave escaped destruction, as at _Fondi_ and _Mola_, show few traces of\r\nwear and decay after a duration of two thousand years\r\n\r\nApsus, a river of Macedonia, the _Aspro_. Caesar and Pompey encamp over\r\nagainst each other on the banks of that river, C. iii. 13\r\n\r\nApulia, a region of Italy, _la Puglia_.

The latter joins the Mosa above Rotterdam. The Yssel was\r\nfirst connected with the Rhine by the canal of Drusus.
