K. MORTON, HIGH STREET,\r\n                                  1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn perusing the following pages, readers, who may be specially interested\r\nin some one particular parish with which they are connected, may in\r\ncertain cases be disappointed on not finding such parish here described,\r\nas they have previously seen it, along with the others, in the columns of\r\nthe “Horncastle News,” where these ‘Records’ first appeared.  This may\r\narise from one of two causes:—\r\n\r\n(1)  The volume published in 1899, entitled “Records of Woodhall Spa and\r\nNeighbourhood” (which was very favourably received), contained accounts\r\nof parishes extending from Somersby and Harrington in the east of the\r\ndistrict, to Horsington and Bucknall in the west, with others between; as\r\nbeing likely to interest visitors to that growing health resort.  These,\r\ntherefore, do not find a place in this volume.\r\n\r\n(2)  Further it is proposed that in the near future this volume shall be\r\nfollowed by a “History of Horncastle,” already approaching completion,\r\nand with it accounts of the fourteen parishes within its “soke.”  These,\r\nagain, are, consequently, not here given.\r\n\r\nThe Records of all these different parishes will be found in the volumes\r\nto which they respectively belong.\r\n\r\nIn again submitting a work of this character to the many friends whom his\r\nformer volume has gained for him, the author wishes to say that he is\r\nhimself fully alive to its imperfections; none could be more so.  In not\r\na few instances it has, almost perforce, come short of his own aim and\r\naspirations; the material available in connection with some of the\r\nparishes described having proved meagre beyond expectation.  In many\r\nchains links have been lost; there are gaps—in some cases a yawning\r\nhiatus—which it has been found impossible to fill.\r\n\r\nFurther, as the account of each parish was intended originally to be\r\ncomplete in itself, and several parishes have, at different periods, had\r\nthe same owners, there will be found, of necessity, some cases of\r\nrepetition as to individuals, their character, or incidents connected\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nAnyone who reads the book will see that it has involved no small amount\r\nof labour; whether in visiting (always on foot) the many localities\r\ndescribed (in all more than 70 parishes having been visited); or in the\r\ncareful search and research, necessary in many directions, for the\r\ninformation required.\r\n\r\nIn both these respects, however, the task has been a congenial one, and\r\nof more or less engrossing interest, thus bringing its own reward.\r\n\r\nIt has been said by a thoughtful writer that no one can enjoy the country\r\nso thoroughly as the pedestrian who passes through it leisurely.\r\n\r\nWe all, instinctively (if not vitiated), have a love of the country.  As\r\nCowper has said:—\r\n\r\n    “’Tis born with all; the love of Nature’s works\r\n    Is an ingredient in the compound man,\r\n    Infused at the creation of his kind.”—(“The Task.”)\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, the cyclist, who rushes through our rural charms with\r\nhead in the position of a battering ram, and frame quivering with the\r\nvibration engendered of his vehicle, who can dwell on these attractions\r\nwith full appreciation.  Nor is it his more reckless brother, the\r\nmotorist, who crashes along our country roads, with powers of observation\r\nnarrowed by hideous binocular vizor, and at a speed whose centrifugal\r\nforce drives in terror every other wayfarer—chicken, child, woman, or\r\nman—to fly like sparks from anvil in all directions, if haply they may\r\neven so escape destruction.  For him, we might suppose, the fascination\r\nmust be to outstrip the thunderbolt, not to linger over mundane scenery.\r\nBut to the man who walks deliberately, and with an observant eye for all\r\nabout him, to him indeed nature unfolds her choicest treasures.  Not only\r\nantiquities such as the British, Roman, or Danish camps on the hill sides\r\nabove him have their special attractions; but the very hedge-rows and\r\nbanks, with their wealth of flower and of insect life, the quarries with\r\ntheir different fossils, the ice-borne boulders scattered about, and even\r\nthe local, and often quaint, human characters, whom he may meet and chat\r\nwith.  All these afford him sources of varied interest as well as\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nThe process, again, of antiquarian investigation is absorbing and\r\nrecuperative, alike to man and matter, bringing to life, as it were,\r\nhabits and customs long buried in the “limbo” of the past, re-clothing\r\ndry bones with flesh, uniting those no longer articulate; like the kilted\r\nwarriors springing to their feet, on all sides, from the heather, at the\r\nsignal of some Rhoderick Dhu.  Here also, albeit, the recording MSS and\r\nfolios may be “fusty,” knights of old are summoned up, as by a long\r\nforgotten roll-call, to fight their battles over again; or high-born\r\ndames and “ladyes fayre,” may unfold anew unknown romances.\r\n\r\nWith our span-new Rural, Urban and County Councils, we are apt to fancy\r\nthat only now, in this twentieth century, is our little world awakening\r\nto real activity; but the antiquary, as by a magician’s wand, can conjure\r\nup scenes dispelling such illusions; and anyone, who reads the following\r\npages, may see that the humblest of our rural villages may have had a\r\npast of stirring incident, which must be little short of a revelation to\r\nmost of its present occupants, “not dreamt of in their simple\r\nphilosophy.”\r\n\r\nAmong the calls of other duties, to one whose occupations are by no means\r\nlimited to this particular field of labour, the work had often, of\r\nnecessity, to be suspended, and so its continuity was liable to be broken\r\ninto a collection of _disjecta corporis membra_.  Such, however, as they\r\nare, the author submits these ‘Records’ to future generous readers, in\r\nthe confident hope that they will make due allowance for the varied\r\ndifficulties with which he has had to contend.\r\n\r\nHe could wish the results attained were more worthy of their acceptance;\r\nbut he has some satisfaction in the feeling that, in his humble degree,\r\nhe has opened up, as it were, a new world (though still an old one) for\r\ntheir contemplation.\r\n\r\nA popular writer has said: “To realise the charm and wealth of interest\r\nof a country side, even in one’s armchair, is an intellectual pleasure of\r\nno mean order.”  If the old-time incidents found in the following pages\r\nenliven some of our modern “ingle neuks,” the author will, in some\r\ndegree, have gained his reward.\r\n\r\n                                                                    J.C.W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRIGENDA. {0}\r\n\r\n\r\nPage 1, line 23, _for_ moot-free _read_ moot-tree.\r\n„ 3, line 11, _for_ Creœceur _read_ Creveceur.\r\n„ 8, line 24, _for_ Sharford _read_ Snarford.\r\n„ 14, line 13, _for_ resident _read_ residence.\r\n„ 18, line 20, _for_ Ascham _read_ Acham.\r\n„ 19, line 9, _for_ Anjon _read_ Anjou.\r\n„ 30, foot-note, _for_ Anjon _read_ Anjou.\r\n„ 31, line 36, _for_ Stukley _read_ Stukeley.\r\n„ 41, line 24, Richard, King, _omit comma_.\r\n„ 44, line 28, Emperor of Constantine, _omit_ of.\r\n„ 45, line 18, _for_ Improprietor _read_ Impropriator.\r\n„ 50, line 1, _for_ Mabysshendery _read_ Mabysshenderby.\r\n„ 51, line 31, _for_ Tessara _read_ Tessera.\r\n„ 56, line 41, _for_ 1349 _read_ 1846.\r\n,, 67, line 23, _for_ call _read_ called.\r\n„ 114, last line, _for_ smalle _read_ smaller.\r\n„ 116, line 8, _for_ Bernek _read_ Bernak.\r\n„ 119, line 9, _for_ his misdeeds _read_ their misdeeds.\r\n„ 125, foot note, _for_ one launcar _read_ one lance.\r\n„ 126, line 34, _for_ 13th century _read_ 18_th_ century.\r\n„ 128, line 35, _for_ attatched _read_ attached\r\n„ 136, line 20, _for_ a aumbrey _read_ an aumbrey.\r\n„ 136, line 42, _for_ Canon Oldfield _read_ Rev.

It includes the hamlets of Stainsby and\r\nHolbeck.  The register dates from 1627.  Letters, via Horncastle, arrive\r\nat 10 a.m.  At Tetford is the nearest money order and telegraph office,\r\nalthough there is in the village an office where postal orders and stamps\r\ncan be obtained.  The principal owners of land are Earl Manvers, the\r\nrepresentatives of the late Mr. Pocklington Coltman, of Hagnaby Priory,\r\nand F. W. S. Heywood, Esq., of Holbeck Hall.  The antiquity of the parish\r\nis implied in its name.  “Ash” is the Danish “esshe” (the pronunciation\r\nstill locally used), and “by” is Danish for “farmstead.”  Indeed, the\r\nwhole of the neighbourhood was overrun by the Danish Vikings, as is shewn\r\nby the termination “by,” which is almost universal, as in Stainsby,\r\nSomersby, three Enderbys, Spilsby, etc.  The ash was probably the “moot”\r\ntree of the village, beneath whose spreading shade the elders sat in\r\ncouncil.  This tree was formerly held sacred.  The “world-tree,” or “holy\r\nash” of the Danish mythology (called by the Druids “Yggdrasil”) was\r\nsupposed to have its top in heaven and its roots in hell {2a} (“Asgard\r\nand the Gods,” by Wagner).  I am aware that another derivation has been\r\nsuggested, viz., that “ash” represents the Norse “is,” “use,” “uisge”\r\n(compare river Ouse), all of which mean “water,” as in Ashbourne, where\r\nthe latter syllable is only a later translation of the former, both\r\nmeaning water.  But I cannot see that water is so prominent a local\r\nfeature as to give a name to this parish, nor to the other Ashbys in the\r\nneighbourhood. {2b}\r\n\r\nThe oldest official notice of the parish is in Domesday Book, where it is\r\nstated that “in Aschebi, Odincarle (Wodin’s churl) and Chilbert had 4\r\ncarucates (_i.e._, 480 acres) rateable” to the tax called “gelt,” their\r\nwhole land being 5 carucates or 600 acres.  This was in Saxon times.\r\nWhen William the Conqueror took possession these were deprived of their\r\nproperty, and he bestowed the manor on Odo, Bishop of Baieux, who was his\r\nhalf-brother on the mother’s side.  On the bishop coming to England,\r\nWilliam created him Earl of Kent, and also Count Palatine, and\r\n“Justitiarius Angliæ.”  He was so powerful that historians of the day\r\ndescribed him as “Totius Angliæ Vice-dominus sub rege,” second only to\r\nthe King.  He held, of the King’s gift, 76 manors in Lincolnshire,\r\nbesides 463 in other parts.  This greatness, however, was his ruin, for,\r\nfrom his pride and arrogancy, he incurred the Conqueror’s displeasure and\r\nwas sent to prison in Normandy.  On the Conqueror’s death, in 1084, King\r\nRufus restored him to his honours, but, finding his power not so great as\r\nformerly, he headed a conspiracy against Rufus in favour of Robert, Duke\r\nof Normandy, and, failing in it, he fled to the Duke, who made him\r\ngovernor of that Province, where he died in 1097.  Ashby Puerorum was\r\nthus again “in the market.”\r\n\r\nThe subsequent history of Ashby is more or less enveloped in the folding\r\nmists of antiquity.  The clouds, however, do here and there lift a\r\nlittle, and we get a glimpse into the past which enables us to form a\r\nshrewd guess as to its early proprietors.  Among the list of noble\r\nsoldiers contained in the famous “Battle Roll” of the Conqueror, as\r\ncoming over with him to England and fighting for him at Hastings, is the\r\nname of Creuquere, or Creveceur, Latinized as “De corde Crepito,” which\r\nsome have rendered “of the craven heart,” not a very likely attribute of\r\na brave soldier.  We prefer another rendering, “of the tender heart,” and\r\nconnect it with the legend of his rescuing a “ladye fayre” at the risk of\r\nhis own life, who was kept “in durance vile” by a knight of ill repute,\r\nin his castle, situated in a lonesome forest.  The name also took the\r\nalternative form of De Curcy.  A de Curcy was seneschal, or High Steward,\r\nto Henry I., and it is a name which ranks high still.  This Creveceur (we\r\nare not sure of his Christian name) was one of a doughty race.  Giraldus\r\nKambrensis tells us of one of them, who conquered the Irish kingdom of\r\nUlster in 1177 (Hibernia Expugnata, lib. ii., c. 16, 17), and was created\r\nEarl of Ulster.  He was of gigantic stature, and in a dispute between\r\nKings Philip of France and John of England, the former sent one of his\r\nmost redoubted knights to maintain his cause, but, the Creveceur being\r\nappointed champion for John, the Frenchman thought it best to show a\r\nclean pair of heels and shun the combat.  In recognition of his valour\r\nthis Knight was allowed by King John to wear his hat in the King’s\r\npresence, a privilege still enjoyed by Lord Kinsale, the present\r\nrepresentative of the family.  Lord Forester had the same privilege\r\ngranted by Henry VIII.\r\n\r\nNow the Creveceurs were lords of considerable territory in the\r\nneighbourhood of Ashby; for instance, at Bag Enderby, Somersby, Tetford,\r\netc., and in the document “Testa de Nevill” (circa 1215) it is stated\r\nthat Hugh Fitz Ralph is tenant, under the Barony of Cecilia de Creveceur,\r\nof lands in Ashby, Tetford, etc.  Other documents lead us back a little\r\nfurther, as an “Assize Roll,” of date A.D. 1202, says that the property\r\ncame from Matilda de Creveceur, who was the daughter and heir of\r\nGislebert Fitz Gozelin, who held lands at Bag Enderby, etc., and this\r\nlast is named as owner in Domesday Book.\r\n\r\nAnother name now appears.  By an Assize Roll of 9 Edw. I. (A.D. 1280),\r\nThomas de Houton claims of Robert de Kirketon, and Beatrix his wife,\r\ncertain “rents and appurtenances in Ashby next Greetham (_i.e._, Ashby\r\nPuerorum), Stainsby,” etc.\r\n\r\nThe Kirketon family would seem eventually to have acquired a part of the\r\nmanor of Ashby Puerorum, and from them it passed to Lord Cromwell of\r\nTattershall.  A Chancery Inquisition, held at Horncastle in 1453, shews\r\nthat the College at Tattershall held the advowsons of Ashby Puerorum,\r\nWood Enderby, Moorby, and several other benefices.  By an Inquisition of\r\nthe same date and place, the Jurors state that the Manors of Ashby\r\nPuerorum and certain other places belong to the Earl of Albemarle.  After\r\nthat, at the Dissolution of Religious Houses (Tattershall College being\r\none), the King granted to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, most of their\r\nlands in the neighbourhood, including those in Ashby Puerorum.  This\r\nbrings us down to 1539.  In course of time a general process of\r\ndissolution also took place in ownership of land.  The lands owned in\r\nthis parish by the Brandons, were sold (22 Elizabeth, _i.e._, in 1580) to\r\nJames Prescott, gentleman, who married a daughter of Sir Richard\r\nMolineux, Knight.  He had a son, John, whose widow married Lord\r\nWilloughby of Parham (Architect. S. Journal vol. xxiii., pp. 128, 9).  By\r\na Feet of Fines, held at Lincoln, of the same date, it is shewn that\r\nGeorge Gedney, Esq., and his descendents, also had lands in this parish\r\nin 20 Henry VII. (A.D. 1504), etc. (Ibidem. p. 27.)  All these lands\r\nultimately passed to Tattershall College.  But even before that date it\r\nwould appear, by a Chancery Inquisition, held at Lincoln, A.D. 1504, that\r\nJoan Eland, {4} the widow of Thomas Gedney, held lands in Ashby Puerorum,\r\nSomersby, and other near places.\r\n\r\nAnother prominent family now appears as owning the manor of, or at least\r\nconsiderable lands in, Ashby Puerorum, viz., the Wentworths.  A tradition\r\nremains that Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, in the reign of Charles\r\nI., and one of his Sovereign’s most faithful adherents, owned the manor\r\nof Greetham.  I have not been able fully to verify this, but a lease of\r\nthat parish was granted in 1685 (see my account of Greetham) to Sir\r\nWilliam Wentworth, Knight, of Ashby Puerorum, who was son of Sir William\r\nWentworth, who fell at the battle of Marston Moor, fighting for Charles\r\nI.  The Parish Award shows that Thomas, Earl of Strafford, was Lord of\r\nthe Manor in 1705.  (“Architect. Soc. Journal,” 1891.)\r\n\r\nThe succession of the Wentworths to this property probably came about in\r\nthis wise.  We have seen that it passed from the Kirketons {5} to Lord\r\nCromwell, and the Cromwells were succeeded, through a marriage on the\r\nfemale side, by the Fortescues; and Camden (“Britannia,” p. 266, ed.\r\n1695) tells us that a daughter of Sir Adrian Fortescue (who was\r\nattainted) being heiress of her mother, married the first Baron\r\nWentworth.\r\n\r\nThe Wentworths were a very ancient family.  They are now represented by\r\nthe Earls Fitzwilliam, one of whose names is Wentworth, and they own the\r\nprincely residence of Wentworth Castle, near Rotherham.  They trace their\r\ndescent from Saxon Royalty, in the person of their ancestor, Sir William\r\nFitz Godric, cousin to King Edward the Confessor.  (“Beauties of England.\r\nYorkshire,” p. 838.)\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that one of this family, accompanying William the\r\nConqueror to England, fought so valiantly at the battle of Hastings that\r\nWilliam gave him a scarf from his own arm (presumably), to stanch a\r\nwound.  Drake, the historian, in his “Eboracensis,” gives plates of the\r\nWentworth monuments in York Cathedral.  The Barony of Wentworth still\r\nsurvives in the present Lord Wentworth, of Wentworth House, Chelsea, its\r\ncreation dating from 1529.\r\n\r\nWe have now done with the Wentworths.  Their property at Ashby descended,\r\ntowards the end of the 18th century, to Mr. Stevens Dineley Totton, from\r\nwhom it passed to Earl Manvers and the Coltman family.\r\n\r\nWe now take the hamlet of Stainsby, which lies to the north-east, distant\r\nabout a mile, on the right of the road to Somersby.  This was formerly\r\nthe chief seat, in this neighbourhood, of the Littlebury family.  We\r\nmention them in our Records of various other parishes.  There are mural\r\nmonuments of them in both Somersby Church and that of Ashby Puerorum; the\r\nformer is a small brass, about 10in, broad by 14in. high, having a\r\nkneeling figure of George Littlebury, with the inscription, “Here lyeth\r\nGeorge Littleburie of Somersbie, 7th sonne of Thomas Littleburie of\r\nStainsbie, who died the 13th daye of October, in ye yeare of our Lord\r\n1612, being about the age of 73 yeares.”  The Littleburys were a very old\r\nfamily, coming originally from Littlebury Manor, near Saffron Walden, in\r\nthe county of Essex, A.D. 1138.  One of them was Chief Justice of\r\nEngland.  Subsequently they had a fine residence at Holbeach Hurn, in\r\nSouth Lincolnshire, and large property in many other places.  We have\r\nspoken already of the Kirketons, as connected with Ashby Puerorum and Sir\r\nHumphrey Littlebury, Knight, whose name appears in the Sheriffs List, in\r\n1324, married Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of Sir John Kirkton (or\r\nKirton), and so became Lord of Holbeach.  Sir John Littlebury {6a}\r\nmarried a daughter of Thomas Meeres, an old and wealthy family, also of\r\nKirton, {6b} and it would seem that it was through this marriage with the\r\nKirtons of Kirton the Littleburys came to Stainsby.  Sir Humphrey was\r\nburied in Holbeach Church, where there is a very fine tomb of him, now in\r\nthe north aisle, but formerly “before the altar.”  The effigy is that of\r\na knight, encased in armour, the hands joined in prayer, the head resting\r\non a woman’s head, which is enclosed in a net, the feet being supported\r\nby a lion.  The sides are covered with roses, and there are four niches,\r\nwith canopies, which probably held figures on a smaller scale.  Two views\r\nof it are given by C. A. Stoddard, in his “Monumental Effigies of Great\r\nBritain” (London, 4to., 1817).  The actual date of the Littleburys coming\r\nto Stainsby cannot be exactly ascertained, but they were there in the\r\nreign of Henry VIII.\r\n\r\nA small proprietor in Stainsby is named in a Chancery Inquisition, 19\r\nHenry VII., No. 20 (_i.e._, A.D. 1503), viz., John H. Etton, who, besides\r\nseveral other lands, held “one messuage and four cottages in Bag Enderby,\r\nStanesby and Someresby,” which lands also passed to Tattershall College.\r\n(“Architect. Soc. Journal,” xxiii., p. 21.)\r\n\r\nStainsby (let not my readers be alarmed, for witches and warlocks are out\r\nof fashion in this unimaginative, or sceptical, age) has not been without\r\nits supernatural associations.  I here give a colloquy held, not many\r\nmonths ago, with a quondam resident.  (J. C. W. loquitur. F. C.\r\nrespondet).  “Well, C., did you ever hear of a ghost at Stainsby?”  “Aye,\r\nthat I did, mony a year sin’.  When I were young, I lived i’ them parts,\r\nand I heard o’ one oftens.”  “Did you ever see it yourself?”  “Noa, I\r\nnever seed it me-sen, but I knowed several as did.”  “Where was it seen?”\r\n“Why, i’ mony places.”  “Tell me one or two.”  “Well, it were seen about\r\nStayensby, haaf a mile afore ye come to Somersby, and it were seen about\r\nthe esh-planting (notice the ‘esh,’ the old Danish pronunciation still\r\nsurviving, the Danish for Ashby being Eshe-by), just afore ye go down to\r\nthe brig o’er the beck.”  “Can you name anyone who saw it?”  “O, many on\r\n’em, specially gean the brig.”  “Name someone.”  “Well, a waggoner living\r\nat Bag Enderby.”  “What was it like?”  “Well, a misty kin’ o’ thing.  Ye\r\ncould make nayther heead nor taal on it, only ye knew it was there, and\r\nit flitted unaccountable.” {7}\r\n\r\nI will here give a few extracts from old documents connected with former\r\nowners, which may be of interest from their peculiarity, or otherwise.\r\n\r\nJohn Gedney, of Bag Enderby, in his will, dated 14 June, 1535, mentions\r\nhis lands in Ashby Puerorum and other parishes.\r\n\r\nMargaret Littlebury, widow of Thos. Littlebury, Esq., of Stainsby, by her\r\nwill, of date 2 January, 1582, requests that she may be buried in the\r\nChurch of Ashby Puerorum, “near unto my husband.”  She bequeaths to the\r\npoor of the parish, as also of Greetham, Salmonby, Somersby, Bag Enderby,\r\nand Hagg, the lease of the Parsonage of Maidenwell; a sheepwalk there to\r\nher sons George and Edward; to her daughter Anne, wife of Thomas\r\nGrantham, £10 (N.B.—The Granthams still survive); to her daughter,\r\nElizabeth Fitzwilliam (a good family), £10; to her daughter, Katherine\r\nWythornwyke, £5; to Thomas Dighton, son of Christopher Dighton, deceased\r\n(a family connected with several parishes), £10; “to Francis Atkinson, my\r\nwarrener, 20s.” (“warrener” probably equivalent to gamekeeper).  She\r\nrefers to a schedule of plate, etc., bequeathed by her late husband to\r\nhis deceased son, Humphrey, to be handed over to his son Thomas.  She was\r\na daughter of John St. Paul, of Snarford.\r\n\r\nThomas Littlebury, of Ashby, by will, proved June 10th, 1590, bequeathed\r\nto his wife Katherine £100, and “one goblett with gylte cover, two\r\n‘tunnes’ (_i.e._, cups) parcel gilte, 6 silver spoons of the best, my\r\ngylte salte I bought of my uncle Kelke, with a cover.”  (The Kelkes were\r\nrelated to the Kirtons of Kirkton).  Then follow a number of bequests of\r\nproperty in various parts of the county.  The husband makes his executors\r\n“my father-in-law, Charles Dymoke, my cousins Andrew Gedney and Thomas\r\nCopledike.”  (N.B.—These are the Copledikes, of whom so many monuments\r\nexist in Harrington Church.)\r\n\r\nGeorge Littlebury, of Somersby, by will, dated 10 Sept., 1612, requests\r\nto be buried “in the Queare of Somersby Church,” and leaves 2s. to it,\r\nand 1s. to Ashby Church, and 1s. to Lincoln Cathedral.  He wishes a stone\r\nto be placed over his grave, and his arms set in the wall, as his\r\nfather’s were at Ashby.  (N.B.—Both these stones and brasses still\r\nexist.)\r\n\r\nWhen the Spanish Armada was expected, among the gentry who contributed to\r\nthe defence of the country, at the Horncastle Sessions, 1586–7, was “John\r\nLittlebury of Hagworthingham Esq. ij. light horse.”  At the same time\r\n“Thomas Littlebery of Staynsby Esq. [furnished] j. launce [and] j. light\r\nhorse.”  At the “Rising” in Lincolnshire (1536) against Henry VIII., on\r\nthe Dissolution of the Monasteries, a previous John Littlebury was just\r\ndeceased, but his son Humphrey took part in it, as also did Robert\r\nLittlebury, who was probably a son of Thomas Littlebury, of Stainsby.\r\n\r\nThe Littleburys and the Langtons of Langton intermarried more than once.\r\nIn the reign of Henry VIII., Rose, daughter of John Littlebury of\r\nHagworthingham, married John Langton, and in the next century (about\r\n1620) Troth. daughter of Thomas Littlebury of Ashby Puerorum, married a\r\nson of Sir John Langton, Knt., High Sheriff of Lincolnshire.\r\n(“Architect. Soc. Journal,” vol. xxii., pp. 166–7).  Probably it was\r\nowing to this connection that we find that Sir John Langton, of Langton,\r\nby his will, dated 25 Sept., 1616, leaves 20s. to the poor of Ashby,\r\nLangton, and several other places.  (N.B.—I am indebted for these\r\nparticulars to “Lincolnshire Wills,” edited by Canon Maddison of\r\nLincoln.)\r\n\r\nThe second half of the name of this parish of Ashby Puerorum is derived\r\nfrom the fact that the rent of certain lands in the parish were assigned\r\ntowards the support of the choristers of Lincoln Cathedral, which is now\r\nraised by a general rate of the parish, and, accordingly, the Dean and\r\nChapter of Lincoln are patrons of the benefice, a vicarage {9} which is\r\nnow held by the Rev. Robert Ward, who resides at Hagworthingham.\r\n\r\nOne of the early Norman Barons, probably Gislebert Fitz Gozelin, erected\r\nhere a gallows (Hundred Rolls, A.D. 1275).  The site of this is not now\r\nknown, unless it may be traced in a part of the parish lying in an\r\neasterly direction from the village, and named “Knowles,” possibly a\r\ncorruption for “Knoll Hill,” a rising ground on which a gallows might\r\nwell be placed as a conspicuous warning for future would-be offenders.  A\r\nlane in the parish is called Galley Lane, which again may point to the\r\nformer gallows.\r\n\r\nAnother field-name in the parish is not without interest, viz.,\r\nPeaseholme.  We have Peasedale gate (_i.e._, road) in Hameringham,\r\nPeasegate Lane at Spilsby, Peasewang (_i.e._, field) in High Toynton, and\r\nsimilar names in Louth and elsewhere.  All these are indicating the\r\ngeneral use of pulse as an article of diet in those early times.\r\n\r\nNear the western end of the village is a farm named “Clapgate,” so called\r\nbecause the fugitive Royalists, after the battle of Winceby (Oct. 11,\r\n1643), kept a neighbouring gate clapping all night in their haste to\r\nescape.  Near this is a footpath across the fields, which leads to\r\nHolbeck Lodge, and here again, till recently, survived the same name,\r\n“Clapgate,” because there was formerly a gate near Holbeck Lodge, on the\r\nnow high road to Salmonby, which was also kept in motion by other\r\nfugitives, to the disturbance of the slumbers of those living near.  And\r\nthis brings us to Holbeck, the other hamlet comprised in the parish of\r\nAshby Puerorum, commonly described as “an extra-parochial liberty.”\r\n\r\nThe name Holbeck contains two Danish, or Norse, elements.  “Hol” implies\r\na hollow, connected with our word “hole.”  We have it in the German Swiss\r\nEulenthal, or hollow dale.  “Beck” is Norse, corresponding to the German\r\n“bach,” as in Schwabach, Staubbach, Reichenbach, etc.  Thus Holbech means\r\na beck or stream running through a hollow. {10}  The name Holbeck still\r\nexists in Denmark.  Thus we have a name, like so many (as already\r\nremarked) in the vicinity, shewing the great immigration of Danes in this\r\nneighbourhood.  There is also a Holbeck near Leeds, to which the Danes,\r\nwho came up the Humber, extended their settlements.  At the back, to the\r\nnorth of the present Holbeck Hall, is the rising ground named “Hoe Hill.”\r\nThis again indicates the same.  The How, or Hoe, is probably the Norse\r\n“Hof,” a holy place (found in such names as Ivanhoe, Ivinghoe,\r\nPiddinghoe, etc.), or it may have been the Norse “Haughr,” a burial\r\nplace.  In that case it may have been held sacred as the burial place of\r\nsome Viking chief, who led his followers in their invasion of the\r\ndistrict.  It may be described as a truncated, and rather obtuse, cone,\r\nwith a dyke, or scarpment, running round it, like a collar round the\r\nneck.  There is a How Hill near Harrogate.  We have also Silver-how,\r\nBull-how, and Scale-how, which were probably the burial places of the\r\nchiefs Solvar, Boll, and Skall.  But whether or not it once served these\r\npurposes, there can be little doubt that it has been a Danish encampment,\r\nand probably a stronghold of the Briton at a still earlier period.  The\r\ndyke would form the outer defence of the height above, from which to\r\ncharge down upon an enemy, laboriously breasting the hill, with\r\noverwhelming advantage to the defenders.  Geologically, Hoe Hill is\r\ninteresting, the ironstone, of which it is composed, being so totally\r\ndifferent from the sandstone of Holbeck below.  These lower rocks are\r\nsaid to be still the haunt of that much-baited, but harmless animal, the\r\nbadger.\r\n\r\nAs to former owners of Holbeck, old title deeds show that it was formerly\r\nthe property of Augusta Ann Hatfield Kaye, sister of Frederick Thomas,\r\nEarl of Stafford, who also, as we have seen, was lord of the manor of\r\nAshby.  She died at Wentworth Castle, and was buried at St. John’s\r\nChurch, Wakefield, May 4, 1802, as I am informed by the present owner, F.\r\nW. S. Heywood, Esq.  Old documents, still existing, show that the house\r\nat Holbeck was formerly called “The Grange,” and from this we may fairly\r\ninfer that, before the Dissolution of the Monasteries, it was a “Grange,”\r\nor dependency, of Tattershall College, which owned other lands in Ashby.\r\nThe site was well adapted for a monastic house, as they invariably chose\r\na position near water, this being necessary for the supply of fish, which\r\nformed so large a portion of their diet when fasting days were so many.\r\n\r\nLike some other parts of this parish, Holbeck also passed, at a later\r\nperiod, into the ownership of Mr. Stevens Dineley Totton, from whom Mr.\r\nJohn Fardell, of the Chantry, Lincoln, and formerly M.P. for that city,\r\npurchased this manor, about 1830.  He took down the old residence, then a\r\nfarmhouse, occupied by a Mr. Hewson, several of whose family are buried\r\nin the churchyard at Ashby, and built Holbeck Lodge, forming also the\r\nthree lakes out of an extent of morass traversed by a brook, or beck.\r\nPortions of the old stables and outhouses still remain, but an\r\ninteresting old circular dovecote {12a} was removed.  There was, at that\r\ntime, a watermill and cottage at the lower end of the lake. {12b}\r\n\r\nThe Lodge was subsequently bought by a Mr. Betts, but, through mortgages,\r\nit became the inheritance of a Miss Cunliffe, from whom Mr. Heywood\r\nrecently bought it.  This gentleman has made considerable improvements\r\nand additions to the residence, and one or two interesting discoveries\r\nhave been made.  In sinking a well there was found, at a depth of 20ft.,\r\nan old key; also, as workmen were trying to trace a drain under the lawn,\r\none of them dropped into a hollow below, where arches were found,\r\napparently of ancient vaults. {12c}  The monks of old knew what was meant\r\nby a good cellar, and these probably formed a part of the original\r\nmonastic institution.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to a description of the church of Ashby in the words of the\r\nlate learned Precentor Venables, who gave it, on the visit of the\r\nArchitectural Society in 1894 (which I conducted).  “The chancel was\r\nrestored in 1869 by the Patrons, the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln.  The\r\nrest was restored in 1877.  The fabric consists of nave, north aisle\r\nchancel, porch, and western tower, having 2 bells.  The main building is\r\nof the Early English style.  A lancet window still remains in the south\r\nwall, and at the west end of the aisle.  The other windows of the nave\r\nare mostly Perpendicular.  On the south side of the chancel is a\r\ntwo-light square-headed window of the Decorated period.  The arcade has\r\ntwo chamfered arches, on low cylindrical piers.  The tower is low, of\r\nPerpendicular style, the green sandstone, picturesquely patched with\r\nbrick, giving a mellowed tint to the whole.  The west doorway is well\r\nproportioned, and the three-light Perpendicular window above it, and the\r\ntower arch are plain, but good.  The font is plain octagonal.  On the\r\nsouth wall is a brass to Richard Littlebury, of Stainsby, who died A.D.\r\n1521, also his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Edmund Jenny, died in\r\n1523, and their ten children. {13}  Haines says that this brass was not\r\ncut till 1560, at the same time with another of a knight in armour,\r\nwithout inscription, probably one of the six sons.  In the pavement is a\r\nvery fine incised slab of blue marble, representing a priest in\r\nEucharistic vestments, with chalice on his breast.  The head, hands,\r\nchalice, and other portions were of brass, but have disappeared.”  An\r\ninteresting discovery was made in this parish rather more than 100 years\r\nago, a description of which I here give in the words of Saunders (“Hist.\r\nCounty Lincoln,” vol. ii., p. 170, 1), who gives particulars more fully\r\nthan any other authority I have been able to consult.  “On the 26th of\r\nOctober, 1794, a labourer, cutting a ditch (the actual site is not given)\r\ndiscovered at a depth of three feet below the surface a Roman sepulchre,\r\nconsisting of a stone chest, in which was deposited an urn of strong\r\nglass, well manufactured, but of a greenish hue; the chest was of\r\nfreestone, such as is found in abundance on Lincoln heath.  When found\r\nthe urn was perfect and had not suffered any of that decay which\r\ngenerally renders the surface of Roman glass of a pearly or opaline hue,\r\nfor the surface was as smooth as if it had newly come from the fire.\r\nThis receptacle was nearly filled with small pieces of bone, many of\r\nwhich, from the effects of ignition, were white through their whole\r\nsubstance; and among the fragments was a small lacrymatory of very thin,\r\nand very green, glass, which had probably been broken through the\r\ncuriosity of the finder, as he acknowledged his having poured out the\r\ncontents upon the grass in the hope of finding money, before he took it\r\nto his employer.  The circumstances attending this sepulchre clearly\r\nprove it to have been Roman.  It is, however, singular that the place\r\nchosen was not, as was customary with that people, near to a highway, and\r\nthat it does not appear to have been the burial place of a family, since,\r\nalthough the trench was dug quite across the field, no traces of a body\r\nhaving been buried in any other part of it were observed. . . . No traces\r\nof the Romans have been observed here . . . except that some coins of\r\nbrass or copper were dug up in an orchard at Stainsby, said to have been\r\nRoman, but as they were not preserved this must remain doubtful. . . .\r\nThe locality, however, is so adapted, for various reasons, to the Roman\r\nvilla, that Sir Joseph Banks, in an article communicated to\r\n‘Archæologia,’ vol. xii., p. 36, thought it ‘not improbable that such a\r\nresidence might some day be discovered, the Roman town of Banovallum\r\nbeing so near, with a number of Roman roads branching through the\r\ncountry.’”\r\n\r\nThe name of Stainsby itself indicates a considerable antiquity, meaning\r\nthe stones-farm.  This may have been from stepping-stones over the\r\nSomersby beck, near at hand or from some quarry of the sandstone in the\r\nvicinity, still so largely used.  The stones were evidently the\r\ndistinguishing feature of the locality.\r\n\r\nP.S.—The writer is requested to say that he is in error in connecting the\r\nfamily of Coltman of Ashby with that of the Pocklington Coltman of\r\nHagnaby, the two being quite distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASTERBY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAsterby is situated about 6½ miles from Horncastle in a north-easterly\r\ndirection, being approached by the road to Scamblesby and Louth, but\r\ndiverging from that road northward shortly before reaching Scamblesby.\r\nThe Rector is the Rev. J. Graham, J.P., who has a substantial residence,\r\nerected at a cost of £1,200 in 1863, and standing on the slope of a hill\r\nin good grounds.  Letters, _viâ_ Lincoln, arrive at 10 a.m.\r\n\r\nNot much can be gathered of the early history of this parish.  It is\r\nnamed in _Domesday Book_ Estreby; this may mean the “buy,” byre, or\r\nfarmstead, of the Saxon Thane Estori.  But, according to another\r\ninterpretation, the three elements of the name are As, or Aes, tre and\r\nby; the first of these implying “water,” the second “a way” or “passage,”\r\nthe third a “homestead,” the whole thus meaning the Homestead by the\r\nwater-way; and so probably referring to the river Bain, which forms the\r\nboundary between this parish and Ranby; its breed of trout being not\r\nunknown to anglers of our own day.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Domesday survey this manor belonged to the Norman noble\r\nIvo Taillebois, doubtless through his marriage with the Saxon heiress of\r\nthe Thorolds, the Lady Lucia.  And she conveyed to the Priory of Spalding\r\ncertain “temporalities,” _i.e._, rents of lands, here, as well as at\r\nScamblesby; her uncle Thorold, Vice-Comes, or Sheriff, of Lincolnshire,\r\nbeing the founder of that institution, and she herself one of its chief\r\nbenefactors.  In the Priory Charters this parish is also called Esterby.\r\n\r\nIvo, however, was only this lady’s first husband, and, as is mentioned in\r\nthe “Notes” on various other parishes with which he was connected, he\r\ndied without issue; and on her re-marrying, {15a} her great possessions\r\npassed to the Romara family, subsequently to the Gaunts, and were then\r\ngradually broken up, and dispersed among their various descendants.  Only\r\na few fragmentary records of former owners can now be found.\r\n\r\nBy Will dated 31st July, 1585, Edmund Dighton, of Little Sturton, leaves\r\nlands in Asterby and elsewhere to his son Robert, and also his leases of\r\nland held by grant of the late Abbot of Kirkstead, and a house called\r\nBeadway Hall.  The Dighton’s were a wealthy family, originally engaged in\r\ncommerce in Lincoln, but afterwards acquiring considerable property in\r\nvarious parts of the county, and taking a good position.  The\r\nheadquarters of the family were at the Old Hall, of which traces still\r\nremain, in Little Stourton; a daughter of Thomas Dighton “of that ilk”\r\nmarried Edward, 2nd son of the 1st Earl of Lincoln, of that line, temp.\r\nElizabeth; she eventually, on the death of his eldest brother, becoming\r\nCountess of Lincoln. {15b}\r\n\r\nElizabeth Hansard, of Gayton-le-Wold, widow, by her Will, dated 17th\r\nMarch, 1591, makes her father, John Jackson, of Asterby, executor, and\r\nthe guardian of her children, Edward, Margaret, and Mary Hansard; and\r\nleaves all her property to them, except 20s. each to her brother Thomas\r\nJackson, and her brother-in-law William Hansard.  These Hansards, a\r\nknightly family located in this county at South Kelsey (also of\r\nBeesthorpe and Thornton), were of very old extraction; tracing their\r\ndescent from Ughtred, Earl of Northumberland in the reign of Edmund\r\nIronsides, who came to the throne A.D. 016. {16}  South Kelsey, their\r\nchief seat, passed to the old family of the Ayscoughs, by the marriage of\r\nSir Francis Ayscough to the Hansard heiress, Elizabeth, in the middle of\r\nthe 16th century.  Both Hansards and Ayscoughs were connected with many\r\nof the leading county families.\r\n\r\nJohn Guevera, of Stenigot, by Will dated 18th March, 1607, leaves his\r\nmanor of Stenigot and all his premises in Asterby (certain portions being\r\nexcepted) to his “Sonne Francis, his heir apparent, on his coming of\r\nage,” and specifies that “till then he be held content by Sir Nicholas\r\nSaunderson, knight, of Fillingham, and Captaine Henrie Guevera, of\r\nBarwick.”  These Gueveras were of Spanish origin, probably coming to\r\nEngland in the train of Catharine of Arragon, or in attendance on King\r\nPhilip of Spain, Queen Mary’s husband.  Spain was then a flourishing\r\ncountry, and they soon acquired property, and took their position among\r\nthe landed gentry, Francis Guevera being named among the Herald’s List of\r\nGentry in 1634.  Sir Nicholas Saunderson, here named, of Fillingham, was\r\ngrandson of Nicholas Saunderson, of Reasby, in the parish of\r\nStainton-by-Langworth.  He was made a baronet in 1612, and Viscount\r\nCastleton in 1628.  The family was involved in the Lincolnshire Rebellion\r\nof 1536.  The manor, and greater part of the parish, are now in the hands\r\nof trustees of the Trafford family, who are also patrons of the benefice.\r\nMessrs. W. Pinning and Benjamin Harrison are also landowners, and Mr.\r\nJames Walter has a large and picturesque farmhouse with good grounds and\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nThe church, dedicated to St. Peter, was for some years in an\r\nunsatisfactory condition, but during recent years it has been gradually\r\nundergoing restoration.  It was formerly larger than it is now, having\r\nhad a north aisle.  The tower was half taken down towards the close of\r\nthe 18th century, and rebuilt, the plinth of the tower buttress on the\r\nsouth side of the west door being said to be the original one of the 12th\r\ncentury.  There are three bells.  In 1896 the chancel was taken down and\r\nextended about 6ft. in length, the interior face of the walls being\r\nconstructed of rubbed sandstone, in courses obtained from a quarry in the\r\nparish.  The exterior character of the old work was carefully preserved,\r\nand a dressed stone plinth-course inserted.  The old east window with\r\nwooden framework was removed and a stone traceried window introduced,\r\nfilled with tinted glass.  The floor was paved with encaustic tiles in\r\nplace of ordinary bricks, and the communion table raised 18 inches above\r\nthe body of the church, by three steps.  A new altar rail of oak, with\r\nstandard of wrought-iron and brass, was put up, and the roof was made of\r\nopen timbers covered with match boards and slates.  This work was done by\r\nMr. R. Mawer, builder, of Louth, under the direction of Messrs. Mortimer\r\nand Son, architects, of Lincoln.  The entire cost was defrayed by the\r\npresent rector.  Since then other improvements have been effected.  The\r\ntower, in a dangerous condition, was partly taken down in 1898, and the\r\nbells rehung in new oak framework.  A handsome altar cloth was presented\r\nby Lady Wigan.  The nave floor has now boards in place of the old damp\r\nand unsightly bricks.  It has been supplied with new seating of\r\npitchpine.  This work was entrusted to Messrs. Thompson & Sons, of Louth,\r\nand is thoroughly satisfactory.  Inspired by these efforts, a generous\r\ndonor, Mrs. Woodall, presented a massive oak lectern in memory of her\r\nparents who for many years worshipped in this church, and the whole\r\nfabric is now at length, through the exertions of the rector, liberally\r\nseconded by Mrs. Graham, a credit to the parish.  Old features of\r\ninterest in the church are the chancel arch, which is Early English; and\r\nin the south chancel wall, near the reading desk, is also a three-light\r\nEarly English window, containing some fragments of very old glass, the\r\nnew east window being a copy of this.  In the north wall of the nave are\r\ntwo bays of the former aisle blocked up, with a grinning figurehead\r\nbetween the arches.  In a frame affixed to the north wall is the text,\r\nfrom Eccl. v., 1, “Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and\r\nbe more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools.”  The font is\r\nold, having an octagonal bowl, with plain shields on each face, the shaft\r\nalso being octagonal and standing on a pediment of three steps.  In the\r\nsouth wall of the chancel, outside, is a mutilated slab bearing an\r\ninscription in memory of “Samson Meanwell, who departed this life Feb.\r\n17, 1744, in ye 63 yeare of his age.”  Nearly opposite the west door is a\r\nvery old yew-tree, which may well have supplied the village archers with\r\ntheir bows in the days of Crecy, Poictiers, and Agincourt.  The benefice\r\nis now held jointly with that of Goulceby.  It was formerly in the gift\r\nof the Dymokes.  Dame Jane Dymoke presented in 1711 and 1725.  She also\r\ngave church plate.  The patronage then passed to the Crown, who presented\r\nin 1771 and 1784, after which the Trafford Southwell family acquired it,\r\nwith the manor, and presented in 1807.\r\n\r\nNear the church is a field named Hall Close, where there are traces of a\r\nlarge residence; and here, about the year 1821, were dug up three human\r\nskeletons and an ancient dagger.\r\n\r\nThe poor of the parish have the benefit of a bequest made by Anthony\r\nAcham, for them, and for those of Goulceby; who also, in 1638, founded a\r\nschool for the two parishes, with Stenigot.\r\n\r\nWe have only to add that the pilgrim to Asterby, who has an eye for rural\r\nscenery, will be gratified on his way thither by an extent of view not\r\noften to be found.  He can take in, at one and the same moment, a\r\nprospect reaching almost 30 miles, including Lincoln Cathedral and miles\r\nbeyond it to the north-west; and embracing Heckington and other fine\r\nchurch spires, with Tattershall Castle to the south-west, and extensive\r\nwoods, corn fields, and meads to vary the scenes between.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAUMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nBaumber, or Bamburgh, lies on the old Roman road, from Horncastle to\r\nLincoln, about 4 miles to the north-west from the former place, and\r\nhalf-a-mile from the point where another Roman road furcates northward\r\nfor Caistor; it is thus somewhat interestingly connected with the three\r\nancient Roman stations, Lindum, Banovallum, and Caistor (Castrum).  Its\r\nown name, in the older form, Bam-burg doubtless means the “Burg,” or\r\nfort, on the Bain; as it stands on high ground above the valley of the\r\nBain, and commands what would formerly be a ford of that river at\r\nHemingby, through which there passes a branch line of road, running due\r\neast from Baumber, and stretching into the wold hills, being doubtless\r\nalso a Roman structure.\r\n\r\nBaumber has had some interesting associations in the past.  In Domesday\r\nBook it is reckoned among the possessions of the Norman Ivo Tayle-bois,\r\nnephew of William the Conqueror, Earl of Anjou, and chief of the Angevin\r\nauxiliaries of William’s army.  Through his wife, the Lady Lucia, the\r\nSaxon heiress of Earl Alf-gar, who was given to him in marriage by the\r\nConqueror, he acquired very large possessions in Lincolnshire and\r\nelsewhere.  He was of a very tyrannical disposition; his chief residence\r\nbeing near Croyland Abbey.  The Historian Ingulphus records of him, that\r\nhe “tortured, harrassed, annoyed, and imprisoned their people”; that “he\r\nchased their cattle with his dogs, driving them into the marsh pools,\r\nwhere they were drowned; cut off their ears, or their tails; broke their\r\nbacks, or their legs; and made them useless.”  When the world was\r\nrelieved of him by an early death, he was not mourned by his Saxon wife,\r\nor anyone else.  Another historian, Peter de Blois, says, “Hardly had one\r\nmonth elapsed after his death, when the Lady Lucia married that\r\nillustrious young man, Roger de Romara, and entirely lost all\r\nrecollection of Ivo Tayle-bois”; and he bursts into a volley of\r\nimprecations, to this effect:—“What does it now profit thee, O Ivo! ever\r\nmost blood-thirsty, thus to have risen against the Lord?  Unto the earth\r\nhast thou fallen, numbered with the dead; in a moment of time thou hast\r\ndescended to hell, a successor of the old Adam, a frail potsherd, a heap\r\nof ashes, a hide of carrion, a vessel of putrefaction, the food of worms,\r\nthe laughing-stock of those who survive, the refuse of the inhabitants of\r\nheaven, the avowed enemy of the servants of God; and now, as we have\r\nreason to suppose, an alien and exile from the congregations of saints,\r\nand for thine innumerable misdeeds, worthy to be sent into outer\r\ndarkness.” {19}\r\n\r\nSuch was one of the proprietors of Baumber, but he was not the only one;\r\nas Domesday mentions another, and larger, and more worthy, land owner in\r\nthe person of Gilbert de Gaunt, who succeeded, “by right,” or, more\r\nstrictly speaking, by confiscation, to all the property of the Saxon\r\nTonna; while another Saxon, Ulf, had also an estate in the parish.  This\r\nGilbert de Gaunt founded Bardney Abbey; and, when he died, was buried\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Lucia was Countess of Chester and Lincoln; and at a later\r\nperiod, Baumber, including the hamlet of Sturton Parva, would seem to\r\nhave been mainly divided between the family of the Earls of Lincoln, more\r\nrecently created Dukes of Newcastle, and the wealthy family of the\r\nDightons.  Both had residences in or near this parish.  A daughter of\r\nThomas Dighton, and his heiress married Edward Clinton, second son of the\r\nfirst Earl of Lincoln of that line (temp. Elizabeth), and on failure of\r\nissue to the elder brother, this Edward succeeded to the Earldom.  Many\r\ngenerations of the Clintons were buried here; but towards the end of the\r\n18th century, the Clinton property was sold by the third Duke to Mr.\r\nThomas Livesey, of Blackburn, Lancashire, {20} whose son, the late Joseph\r\nLivesey, Esq. erected a large mansion in 1810, which again was almost\r\nrebuilt, and considerably enlarged in 1873–5.  A large part of the parish\r\nnow belongs to the Vyner family of Gautby.  The Baumber register dates\r\nfrom 1691.  One entry is “June 20th, 1730, the Corpse of the Right\r\nHonourable, the Right Noble, Lord George Clinton, Earl of Lincoln, was\r\ninterred.”\r\n\r\nThe Church is dedicated to St. Swithun.  The west door is a good specimen\r\nof Norman work, with dog-tooth pattern running round the semi-circular\r\narch, in bass relief; the capital of its south pillar has a head, with\r\nserpents whispering into each ear.  The north capital is a conventional\r\nacanthus.  The inner eastern door of the tower is also Norman, but plain.\r\nThe Nave has north and south aisles of three bays; the eastern-most\r\ncolumn of the north arcade, under the removable flooring of the Vicar’s\r\nseat, has the original round Norman plinth, the only one preserved.  The\r\nChurch of stone was cased in brick, in the early part of the eighteenth\r\ncentury (1736), when the present large, perpendicular windows were placed\r\nin the north and south walls, three in each.  Placed against the west\r\nwall, south of the west entrance, is a large slab, commemorating John\r\nEaland, who died in 1463, and his wives Alice and Elizabeth.  This was\r\nformerly in the floor of the north aisle.  Above is a tablet in memory of\r\nmembers of the family of J. Bainbridge Smith, D.D., formerly Vicar, as\r\nwell as Rector of Sotby, and of Martin, and Headmaster of the Horncastle\r\nGrammar School.  The Font is octagonal and massive, but plain.  There is\r\na handsome oak lectern with eagle on swivels, the gift of Mrs. Taylor\r\nSharpe, of Baumber Park, in memory of her eldest son, who died in 1891.\r\nThe pose of the eagle is very natural.\r\n\r\nIn the south aisle, and over the west entrance are hatchments of the\r\nClintons.\r\n\r\nIn the chancel, the east window is blocked up; there are two windows in\r\nthe north wall, one in the south wall, the second having been removed\r\nwhen a vestry was erected, and it now forms the vestry window.  On each\r\nside, east of the chancel arch, are remains of massive early English\r\npillars.  South of communion table are three plain sedilia of wood.\r\nNorth of the table, a blue slate slab in the floor, with the Clinton\r\narms, covers the vault, in which sixteen of the Clinton family are\r\ninterred.  Another slab close by, commemorates “Francis Clinton, alias\r\nFynes, Esq., grandson of Henry Lord Clinton, Earl of Lincoln, who\r\ndeparted this life, February 5th, A.D. 1681.”  On the south, a slab\r\ncommemorates his wife, “who died, February 15th, A.D. 1679.”  A communion\r\nchair, of very solid construction, was carved out of a beam formerly in\r\nTattershall Castle.  There are some remains of a former rood screen,\r\n“Arch. Journ.,” 1890, p. 206.\r\n\r\nMr. Weir, in his History of Lincolnshire (vol. I., p. 299, Ed., 1828),\r\nsays that portions of the former residence of the Earls of Lincoln were\r\nat that date still standing, near the modern mansion of the Liveseys.\r\nThen the latter was re-constructed in 1873–5, the furniture and other\r\narrangements, were of a very costly character.  The present writer, with\r\nan acquaintance of the family, had the privilege of being shewn over the\r\nwhole house, by the lady of the house, shortly after its completion.  It\r\nmight be called a repertoire of valuable works of art and vertu, in\r\nfurniture, books, paintings, stuffed birds, and animals, among the latter\r\nbeing the famous lion “Nero,” from the Zoo.  The owner, being devoted to\r\nengineering and mechanical operations, had one room, of which the walls\r\nwere covered with clocks, of endless kinds, with various elaborate\r\nmechanism, such as cocks crowing, horns blowing, etc., etc., for chiming\r\nthe hours.  All these came to the hammer in 1891.  Even the economy of\r\nthe farm yard was elaborate.  To give one instance:—At the back of the\r\ncattle sheds, ran a tramway of small trucks; doors opened at the back of\r\nthe crib of each stall, and the trucks conveyed the exact modicum of\r\nprovender, and it was injected into each separate crib, periodically, for\r\nthe animals which were there fed.  The lake in the park was formed from a\r\nsmall stream running through the grounds, it is well stocked with fish of\r\nvarious kinds, especially affording sport to the troller by the abundance\r\nof fine pike.  It was originally stocked, as tradition avers, from the\r\nMoat of Langton Rectory, now no longer existing, but formerly of\r\nconsiderable size, and connected with a large pond, where fish of many\r\nkinds abounded.  The vicarage is a substantial residence, with good\r\ngarden, erected in 1857, on a site presented by Robert Vyner, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBELCHFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelchford is one of our largest villages, lying at a distance of about 5\r\nmiles from Horncastle, in a north-east direction, and buried in a valley\r\namong the wolds.  It was anciently among the possessions of the\r\nConqueror’s nephew, Ivo Tailebois, which he acquired by his marriage with\r\nthe Lady Lucia, the wealthy heiress of the Thorolds.  Tithes and\r\nterritory here were assigned by her to the Abbey of Croyland, as well as\r\nto its cell, the branch Priory of Spalding.  There were two mills here,\r\nvalued in Domesday book, at 18s. 8d. yearly.  The acreage is large; Ivo\r\nhad five carucates in demesne, or some 600 acres, while villeins,\r\nbordars, and soc-men, occupied nine carucates, or about 1080 acres; there\r\nwere 360 acres of meadows, and six carucates (720 acres) reateable to\r\ngelt.  The arable land was a mile long, and a mile broad, which was a\r\nlarge proportion.  The acreage is now 2480, the population more than 400.\r\nBy an indenture, 28th October, 1641, we find Sir Thomas Glemham owning\r\nlands in Belchford and Oxcombe, as well as other places, which he sold to\r\nSir Matthew Lister, and his brother Martin Lister, subsequently the\r\nListers of Burwell Park.  The Listers, however, sold the Belchford lands\r\nagain to Sir Thomas Hartopp, about 20 years later.  Mr. Robert Charles de\r\nGrey Vyner is now Lord of the Manor, but much of the land belongs to the\r\nEpton, Reed, and other families.  At the inclosure, land left by Henry\r\nNeave to the poor, was exchanged for two acres, now let for £5 15s.,\r\nwhich is distributed among the poor at Christmas, as well as a rent\r\ncharge of 4s., left by Mrs. Douglas Tyrwhitt.  Letters, _via_ Horncastle,\r\narrive at 9.30 a.m.  The nearest telegraph office is at Tetford.\r\n\r\nOf the church of St. Peter and St. Paul, little can be said which is\r\nsatisfactory, at the present time.  It was rebuilt in 1781, in the\r\ncharacteristic poor style of that period.  Some years ago it became\r\nalmost unsafe, and the walls were strengthened to prevent their falling.\r\nThe chancel was rebuilt in 1859–60; and in 1884–5, the church was\r\nreseated, the plaster ceiling removed, a new floor supplied, and fresh\r\nwindows inserted; but once more it is in a bad and unsightly condition,\r\ngaps and fissures appear in the walls, the tower is much out of the\r\nperpendicular, and only kept together by bands of iron.  The north wall\r\nis only relieved by one very plain Georgian window.  The east window, a\r\ntriplet in the early English style, is perhaps the best feature in the\r\nchurch.  It was put in by a former Rector, Rev. W. Anthony Fitzhugh.  The\r\nfont, which is octagonal and perpendicular, formerly stood in St. Mary’s\r\nChurch, Horncastle.  The pulpit, of old oak, came from the private chapel\r\nof Lord Brougham, who was a relative of the late Rector; it has some\r\nquaintly-carved panels, and other portions in the same style lie unused\r\nin the church.  The baptismal register has an entry of a baptism\r\nperformed by Dr. Tennyson, father of the Poet Laureate.  The register\r\ndates from 1698.\r\n\r\nSome embellishments have been introduced in the chancel of late by the\r\npresent Rector.  An Italian crucifix, behind the Communion table, with\r\ndevices representing the keys of St. Peter, and sword of St. Paul, the\r\npatron saints, with vine leaves and grapes, and a central chalice.  There\r\nis a scroll below these, bearing the words, “Ecce panis Angelorum Factus\r\ncibus Viatorum.”  The church ornaments include a processional cross of\r\n18th century foreign work.  An effort is now being made to accomplish a\r\nthorough restoration of the church.  A flint implement was found in the\r\nparish in the year 1851, and fossils of the Echinus and other kinds have\r\nbeen found.  The name of Belchford may be British; Bel (Baal) being the\r\nDruid name of the Sun-God and “fford,” is Welsh (or British), for road; a\r\nmore pleasing, if more fanciful, derivation, has been suggested, viz.:\r\nthat the prefix is connected with the words “bellow” and “bell,” and\r\nrefers to the tinkling music of the ford on the brook, which passes\r\nthrough the valley.\r\n\r\nIn an ancient register of Spalding Priory, of date 1659, is an extract\r\nfrom a charter of the foundation of the Priory, in which it is stated\r\nthat one Thorold, ancestor of Lucia, Countess of Lincoln and Chester, and\r\nwife of Ivo Tailebois, gave the Tithes of Belchford, Scamblesby, etc., to\r\nthe Priory.  The name is there spelt Beltisford, which would seem to\r\nfavour the former of these two derivations.  In Domesday Book it is\r\nBeltisford, further confirmatory of the same.\r\n\r\nA former Rector of this Benefice was somewhat of a “character.”  He was a\r\n_bon vivant_, though not of an objectionable kind.  He was popular among\r\nhis clerical brethren, and, like several others, gave an annual clerical\r\ndinner, which was attended by them from considerable distances.  One of\r\nthe special features of the repast, was a leg of mutton, with port wine\r\nsauce, which, as well as the wine, might be said to be “old.”  The\r\ncellars of the rectory were very cool, and he usually had a leg which had\r\nbeen hanging for a quarter of a year, half a year, or more.  At one of\r\nthe last of his dinners, the joint had been in the cellar, specially\r\npreserved, for more than twelve months, but, served as it was, with a\r\ngood surrounding, it was unanimously declared to be excellent.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Egremont Richardson was long remembered by many friends, for his\r\nkindly, genial qualities.\r\n\r\nSince the above remarks on the church were written, the fabric has, in a\r\ngreat measure, been worthily restored.  The architect, Mr. Townsend, of\r\nPeterborough, employed Messrs. Thompson, of Peterborough (who have\r\nrestored Peterborough Cathedral), and they have done the work thoroughly.\r\nThe tower, in a dangerous condition, has been taken down, and will not be\r\nrebuilt until funds allow it, but otherwise the restoration is complete.\r\nFive decorated windows have been introduced into the former dark walls, a\r\nvestry has been added, and the walls of the nave have been beautifully\r\ndecorated.  The chancel walls are relieved with terra cotta, of the 17th\r\ncentury style, the roof having black and white arrow-head work.  The\r\nchoir stalls are stained green, and decorated in harmony with the walls.\r\nThere is a new altar-table of oak, its panels being richly painted.  The\r\nnave is furnished with chairs, in place of the old pews.  The church is\r\nheated with the Radiator system, on the Italian principle, supplied by\r\nMessrs. J. Ward & Co., of Horncastle, being the first church in the\r\nneighbourhood furnished with this apparatus.  In the porch is preserved a\r\nrelic of the past, an old stoup, or holy water vessel, found in the\r\nChurchwarden’s yard.  This has been done at a cost of about £900, and a\r\nfurther sum of £700 or £800 will be needed to restore the tower.  The\r\nchief donors to the work have been the Rawnsley family, and Lord Heneage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLINGBROKE, OLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nBolingbroke, to which is now added the epithet “old,” to distinguish it\r\nfrom the modern creation, New Bolingbroke, near Revesby, lies distant\r\nabout seven miles, in an easterly direction from Horncastle, and about\r\nfour miles westward from Spilsby, in a kind of _cul-de-sac_, formed by\r\nsteep hills on three sides.  As to the meaning of the name, whether its\r\ncommonly accepted derivation from the brook, the spring-head of which, as\r\nCamden says (Britannia, p. 471), is in low ground hard by, be correct, we\r\nmust leave to full-fledged etymologists to decide; but the small\r\nstreamlet, as it exists at present, in no way answers to the ideal of a\r\nbowling brook, sufficient to be a distinguishing feature of the place.\r\nWe would venture to suggest, as a fair subject for their enquiry, that,\r\nas “bullen” is Danish for “swollen,” and “brock” is only another form of\r\n“burgh” (and common enough in Scotland), meaning a fort (as we have a few\r\nmiles away, near Hallington station, _Bully_-hill, near an ancient\r\nencampment), there may have been an older fort, swelling out like an\r\nexcrescence at the mouth of this valley; and so a “bollen” (or bulging)\r\n“broc,” providing a fitting site on which the later castle was also\r\nerected.  It might, too, seem some confirmation of this, that, in\r\nDomesday Book, the name is given as Bolin broc.  Be this as it may,\r\nhowever, the place itself is one of unusual interest to the archæologist.\r\nIt is a town in decadence.  Possessed of a market-place, and a number of\r\ngood houses, some paved streets, a fine church, the site of a castle, and\r\nthat rare distinction an “Honour,” it is yet but a village, with little\r\nto stir its “sleepy hollow” into social life or animation.  The visitor\r\nmay, perhaps, meet there (as the writer has done), one who has retired\r\nfrom her Majesty’s service; who has weilded his cutlass on quarterdeck,\r\nor carried his rifle through stockade or over battlement; the said\r\nindividual may long, on the settle by the snug hostel fire, to fight his\r\nbattles over again, in converse with some kindred spirit; but there is\r\nnow no tread of sentinel on castle-wall, no warder now blows his bugle at\r\ncastle gate.  The castle itself is but a phantom of the past, only to be\r\nnow seen in imagination.  He would, perhaps, fain know something of its\r\nbygone history; but he finds no one to tell it.  Ichabod echoes through\r\nthe silent streets, and he can only murmur in the words of an ancient\r\nlament (for, is it not written in the book of Jasher?) “How are the\r\nmighty fallen and the weapons of war perished.”  The County Directory\r\ntells him (as would also Domesday Book) that Bolingbroke had a weekly\r\nmarket {26a}; from a like authority he may learn that the soke, or\r\nHonour, of Bolingbroke embraced nearly 30 parishes, Spilsby amongst them.\r\n{26b}  Yet he goes to Spilsby on a Monday and finds it crowded with\r\ntraffickers, while, from week’s end to week’s end, the market place of\r\nBolingbroke does not see a merchant or a huckster.  Sooth to say, the\r\nsecluded nature of the locality, which of old commended it as a fitting\r\nposition for a strongly-protected castle, embedded in hills, save on one\r\nside, served really to isolate it from the outer world, and hindred, and\r\nultimately destroyed, the traffic, which became gradually transferred to\r\nother towns more easy of access.  And so the once busy market is grass\r\ngrown, and the buzz of its barter would not awaken a baby.  The sole\r\nsound, indeed, of any volume, to break the moribund monotony—and this\r\nonly one of recent creation—is the peal of fine bells with which the\r\nchurch is now furnished, and instead of soliloquising further we will now\r\nproceed to describe these, and then unfold the fine features of the\r\nchurch, of which they form so melodious an appurtenance.  There are six\r\nlarger bells and the old sanctus bell.  Of the larger bells, one is old,\r\nand five were presented in 1897, by Miss Maria Wingate, whose family,\r\nformerly resided at Hareby House, which small parish and benefice were\r\nannexed to Bolingbroke in 1739. {27}  The five new bells were cast by\r\nMessrs. Taylor, of Loughborough, a well-known firm of bell-founders.\r\nThese were consecrated by Bishop King, of Lincoln, soon after they were\r\nhung.  On one of them, the treble bell, is the inscription, “God save the\r\nQueen, a thank-offering in commemoration of Queen Victoria’s Jubilee,\r\n1897.”  The peculiar appropriateness of this inscription will be the more\r\nmanifest, when the singular fact is remembered (as will be fully\r\nexplained hereafter), that, as Duchess of Lancaster, the Queen was Lady\r\nof the Manor of Bolingbroke.  The old bell bears the date 1604, and has\r\nthe inscription—\r\n\r\n    “I, sweetly tolling, men do call,\r\n    To taste our meats that feede the soole.”\r\n\r\nThis old bell is a very fine one, and is named among the “Bells of\r\nLincolnshire.”\r\n\r\nOf the church itself, dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul, it may be said\r\nthat it has had its peculiar vicissitudes.  It was built probably by John\r\nof Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster; as the flamboyant style of its architecture\r\nindicates a late 14th century erection; and he was granted the manor in\r\nthat century (1363).  Many of our finest churches, such as those of\r\nBoston, Grantham, Heckington, &c., were built in that century.  This of\r\nBolingbroke is one of the latest of them, corresponding most closely in\r\nstyle and date to the Church of Kyme Priory; but it is certainly not one\r\nof the least striking.  We now see in it only a portion of the original,\r\nnamely, the south aisle, porch, and tower.  It was occupied as head\r\nquarters by the Parliamentary troops in 1643, while they were laying\r\nsiege to the castle, which was held for the King; and, with their usual\r\npuritan hatred of holy places, they destroyed the beautiful stained glass\r\nwhich adorned the windows; while, further, their presence there drew upon\r\nthe building heavy bombardment by the King’s men, no less destructive to\r\nthe edifice itself.  Since that time, the original south aisle has been\r\nused as the main body of the church; and until recently, the arches of\r\nthe arcade, formerly dividing it from the original nave, were distinctly\r\nvisible, built up in the (later) north wall; while the tower, originally\r\nstanding at the west end of the nave, became (in consequence of the\r\ndestruction of the latter, semi-detached from the later south aisle)\r\nchurch, at its north-west angle.  The church was restored in 1889,\r\nthrough the munificence of Mr. C. S. Dickinson, of Lincoln, at a cost of\r\n£3,000; the architect being the late Mr. James Fowler; and it was\r\nre-opened by the Bishop on Oct. 10th of that year; the old disfiguring\r\ngalleries having been removed, and new battlements and pinnacles being\r\nadded to the tower; and a new north aisle being erected, extending\r\neastward from the tower; the original south aisle being still retained as\r\na modern nave, re-seated, and re-furnished in every respect; and a new\r\norgan added, with various improvements.  As to the result, we cannot do\r\nbetter than quote some of the observations of the late Precentor\r\nVenables, made by him on the visit of the Lincolnshire Architectural\r\nSociety in 1894. {28}  He described it as “a building of great\r\nstateliness, the proportions being excellent, and in its general design\r\nand architectural details, presenting a specimen of the decorated style\r\nin its greatest purity and beauty; the windows are almost faultless\r\nexamples of flowing tracery in its early purity.  The east window has\r\nfive lights, with quatrefoil window in the gable above; the west window\r\nfour lights; and the side windows three lights each; all excellent.  The\r\nsouth porch has a well-proportioned inner door with good moulding; there\r\nbeing an open quatrefoil over the door.  In its east corner there is a\r\nvery sumptuous holy water stoup of unusual design, surmounted by a tall\r\ncanopy of great richness.  There is a statue bracket over the door, and\r\none at the side.  The recently opened arcade on the north side of nave is\r\ncomposed of fine equilateral arches, with mouldings continuous from their\r\nbases, without the intervention of capitals.  On the south wall of the\r\npresent chancel is a range of three rich, though rather heavy, stone\r\nsedilia, with projecting canopies over-braided with wall-flowers, and\r\ngroined within Traces of canopied niches of similar design to the\r\nsedilia, are visible on each side of the east window.  The piscina, with\r\nprojecting basin, is plain.”\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the south wall of the nave there is also an old piscina,\r\nwith aumbrey above it, which would indicate that, in the original church,\r\nthere was here a chantry. {29}  The present pulpit, and the choir seats\r\nin the chancel, are of modern oak richly carved; and the vestry, at the\r\nback of the organ, is screened off by similar rich modern oak carving.\r\nThe tower has a west door, with a four-light window over it; a two-light\r\nwindow above this, with corresponding ones in the north and south faces.\r\nWithin the tower, over an ancient fireplace, is embedded in the wall,\r\n4ft. from the ground, a curious old gurgoyle head of peculiar\r\nhideousness, which doubtless, at one time, grinned down from the original\r\nroof.  Over the said fireplace there is this inscription graven in a\r\nstone:—“Sixpence in bread every Sunday for ever for the poore women\r\npresent at divine service, given by John Andred, M.A., rector of\r\nBolingbroke, Anno Domini MDCLXXX.”\r\n\r\nIn the churchyard is a tall monument, surmounted by a cherub with\r\nexpanded wings, in memory of Edward Stanley Bosanquet, who died July\r\n16th, 1886, formerly vicar; also of his wife Emmeline, and three\r\nchildren, who died at different dates.  Outside the north wall are some\r\nstone ends of seats, formerly in the tower.\r\n\r\nIt may here be worthy of remark that Chancellor Massingberd, in his\r\naccount of the battle of Winceby mentions that “among the slain on the\r\nside of the King was a Lincolnshire gentleman of the name of Hallam, the\r\nimmediate ancestor of the Historian of the Middle Ages,” Henry Hallam.\r\nThe name is not a common one; and on a broken stone slab, lying behind\r\nthe N.E. buttress, under the N.E. window, is the fragmentary inscription,\r\n“Body of Henry Hallam, who dyed January The 6, 1687.” {30a}\r\n\r\nWe conclude our notice of this church with the words of the\r\nPrecentor:—“We may realize the magnitude, and the beauty of the (former)\r\nentire church, when we bear in mind that, besides what we now see, there\r\nwas a wide nave, a north aisle, doubtless equal in dimensions and style\r\nto that now standing, and a long chancel reaching to the limits of the\r\nchurchyard.”  A building so fine would attest the former importance of\r\nthe place; and we now proceed to consider other proofs of that importance\r\nwhich we know to have existed.\r\n\r\nBolingbroke is, indeed, a place of no mushroom growth.  The Castle was\r\nbuilt in the reign of Henry I. by William de Romara, Earl of Lincoln, who\r\nalso founded the Abbey of Revesby about 1143.  But history carries us\r\nback to a still earlier date, and to an older, and even more interesting,\r\nand more important family than that of Romara.  The mother of William de\r\nRomara (or, according to others, his grandmother) was Lucia, a Saxon\r\nheiress {30b}; sister of the powerful Morcar, Earl of Northumberland, who\r\nfor some time withstood the Conqueror, and daughter of Algar, Earl of\r\nMercia, who was the brother of Edgiva, King Harold’s Queen (others making\r\nEdgiva the sister of Lucia).  She was also a near relative of the\r\nrenowned “Hereward the Wake,” the stubborn champion of Saxon freedom.\r\nThere was an earlier Algar, Earl of Mercia, who, 200 years before, fell\r\nin the famous fight of Threckingham (between Sleaford and Folkingham)\r\nagainst the Danes, about A.D. 865.  He was the son of another Algar, and\r\ngrandson of Leofric, both successively Earls of Mercia; the wife of the\r\nlast-named being the Lady Godiva (or God’s gift, “Deodata”), renowned for\r\nher purity and good works.  This Lady Godiva was the sister of Turold, or\r\nThorold, of Bukenale (Bucknall), {30c} Lord of Spalding, and Vice-Count,\r\nor Sheriff of the County of Lincoln.  And these Thorolds, father and son,\r\nwere among the chief benefactors of the famous Monastery of St. Guthlac,\r\nat Croyland; a similar good work being also performed, in her own day, by\r\nthe aforesaid Lady Lucia, who was chief patroness of the Priory of\r\nSpalding {31a} an offshoot of the greater Croyland Abbey.  Thus William\r\nof Romara was not only a Norman “of high degree,” on his father’s side,\r\nbut, through his mother, he came of a race of Saxons, powerful, brave,\r\nand distinguished for their services to their country and religion.  It\r\nhas been frequently observed that, although the Normans conquered and\r\nsubjugated Saxon England, the stubborn Saxon eventually absorbed, or\r\nprevailed over, his Norman master; and we have an illustration of it\r\nhere, not uninteresting to men of Lincolnshire.  The name of Romara has\r\nlong been gone, in our country and elsewhere, beyond recall; but the old\r\nSaxon name of Thorold yet stands high in the roll of our county families.\r\nThere is probably no older name in the shire; none that has so completely\r\nmaintained its good position and succession, in unbroken descent. {31b}\r\n\r\nNow the Lady Lucia inherited many of the lands of her Saxon ancestors;\r\nand among those which passed to her Son William of Romara, was\r\nBolingbroke.  He was a man of many, and wide domains, but of them all he\r\nselected this, as the place for erecting a stronghold, capable of defence\r\nin those troublous times.  The castle is described by Holles (temp.\r\nCharles I) as “surrounded by a moat fed by streams, and as covering about\r\nan acre and half; built in a square, with four strong forts,” probably at\r\nthe corners; and “containing many rooms, which were connected by passages\r\nalong the embattled walls and capable to receyve a very great prince with\r\nall his trayne.”  The entrance was “very stately, over a fair draw\r\nbridge; the gate-house uniforme, and strong.”  The gateway, of which the\r\ncrumbling ruins were engraved by Stukeley in the first half of the l8th\r\ncentury, finally fell in 1815; and nothing now remains above ground.  The\r\nwhole structure was of the sandstone of the neighbourhood, which, as\r\nHolles observes, will crumble away when the wet once penetrates it.  The\r\nmoat is still visible; and further, in the rear of it, to the south,\r\nbeyond the immediate precincts, there is another moated enclosure, still\r\nto be seen, the residence doubtless of dependants under the shelter of\r\nthe castle; or these may have been earthworks excavated by the forces\r\nbesieging the castle.  We cannot here give in detail the long and varied\r\nhistory of the great owners of Bolingbroke.  But, omitting minor\r\nparticulars:—“A Gilbert de Gaunt by marrying a Romara heiress, obtained\r\nthe estate.  One of his successors of the same name, joining the Barons\r\nagainst King John and Henry III., forfeited it.  It was then granted to\r\nRanulph, Earl of Chester.  It afterwards passed to the de Lacy family,\r\nearls in their turn, of Lincoln; and by marriage with Alicia de Lacy,\r\nThomas Plantagenet, grandson of Henry III. obtained it, with the title.\r\nA later Gaunt, the famous John, Duke of Lancaster, married the heiress of\r\nthis branch of the Plantagenets, and so in turn became Earl of Lincoln\r\nand Lord of Bolingbroke, and their son Henry, born here April 3, 1366,\r\nbecame Henry IV.  As being the birthplace of a sovereign, the estate,\r\ninstead of remaining an ordinary manor, was elevated to the rank of an\r\n‘Honour’” (Camden’s Britannia, p. 471) and is entitled, in all legal\r\ndocuments “the Honour of Bolingbroke.”  Since the accession of Henry IV.\r\nit has remained an appanage of the Crown; and as Duke of Lancaster, King\r\nEdward is “Lord of the Honour,” at the present day.  Gervase Holles\r\nstates that Queen Elizabeth made sundry improvements in the interior of\r\nthe castle, adding “a fayre great chamber with other lodgings.”  The\r\nConstable of the Castle was (in his day) “Sir William Mounson, Lord\r\nCastlemayne, who received a revenue out of the Dutchy lands of £500 per\r\nannum; in part payment of £1,000 yearly, given by the King to the\r\nCountess of Nottingham his lady.”  He also says “In a roome in one of the\r\ntowers they kept their audit for the whole Dutchy of Lancaster,\r\nBolingbroke having ever been the prime seat thereof, where the Recordes\r\nfor the whole country are kept.” {32}\r\n\r\nAnd he then gives a detailed account of the following supernatural\r\noccurrence, as being beyond controversy authenticated:—Which is, that the\r\ncastle is haunted by a certain spirit in the likeness of a hare; which,\r\n“att the meeting of the auditors doth runne betweene their legs, and\r\nsometimes overthrows them, and soe passes away.  They have pursued it\r\ndowne into the castleyard, and seen it take in att a grate, into a low\r\ncellar; and have followed it thither with a light, where, notwithstanding\r\nthey did most narrowly observe it, and there was no other passage out,\r\nbut by the doore or windowe, the roome being all close-framed of stones\r\nwithin, not having the least chinke or crevice, they could never finde\r\nit.  Att other times it hath been seen to run in at the iron grates below\r\ninto other of the grotto’s (as their be many of them), and they have\r\nwatched the place, and sent for hounds, and put in after it; but aftar a\r\nwhile they came crying out.”  (Harleian M.S.S. No. 6829, p. 162).  The\r\nexplanation of this hare-brained story we leave to others more versed in\r\nthe doings of the spirit world; merely observing that such an apparition\r\nhas not been entirely confined to Bolingbroke Castle.\r\n\r\nThe town of Bolingbroke confers the title of Viscount on the family of\r\nSt.-John of Lydiard Tregoze, Co. Wilts.  The career, the abilities, the\r\naccomplishments, the vicissitudes, and the writings, of the great\r\nstatesman, author and adventurer, Henry St.-John, Viscount Bolingbroke,\r\nduring the reigns of Anne, William and Mary, and George I. are too\r\nwell-known, to need further mention here.\r\n\r\nSaunders in his History of Lincolnshire (Vol. ii., p. 101, 1834) says\r\nthat there was then still in the church the remains of an altar cloth,\r\nbeautifully embroidered, and traditionally said to have been the work of\r\nBlanche, Duchess of Lancaster, wife of John of Gaunt, and mother of Henry\r\nIV., who is celebrated in Chaucer’s poem “the Dream.”  Chancellor\r\nMassingberd, however, writing his account of Bolingbroke Castle in 1858\r\n(“Architect Soc. Journ.” vol. iv. p. ii.) says that it had then\r\ndisappeared, and not been seen for some 20 years, having probably been\r\ndisgracefully purloined.\r\n\r\nThe parish register dates from 1538; a rather unusual occurrence, as the\r\nkeeping of registers was only enforced 1530–8 by Act of 27 Henry VIII.,\r\nand the order was in few cases observed till a later period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDLINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a pleasant, small village, about 2½ miles from Horncastle, the\r\nchief approach to it being by the so-called “Ramper,” the great Roman\r\nroad, connecting the two Roman fortresses, Lindum and Banovallum (Lincoln\r\nand Horncastle), and still one of the best roads in the county.  The Park\r\nof Edlington, now the property of the Hassard Short family, is a\r\npleasantly undulating enclosure, adorned with some very fine trees;\r\nalthough of late some £3,000 worth, chiefly of outlying timber, has been\r\nconverted into cash.  The ground is varied by small copses, which afford\r\nexcellent pheasant and rabbit shooting; as also do two covers, about two\r\nmiles from the Park, called Edlington Scrubs; and there are also some\r\nvery gamey plantations, belonging to the estate, situated about two miles\r\nnorth-west from Woodhall Spa.  The estate comprises about 2,700 acres,\r\nand is fully five miles long from one end to the other, being intersected\r\nby portions of other parishes.  There was formerly a substantial\r\nresidence, with stew ponds and extensive gardens, at the upper or\r\nnorthern end of the park, {34a} with the parish road running behind it,\r\ncovered by lofty trees.  Here, it may interest the botanist to know that\r\nthe plant “Butcher’s Broom” (Ruscus Aculeatus) grew plentifully, although\r\nit now seems to be extinct, having been improved away.  From this\r\nposition there is a very fine view, extending many miles to the south and\r\nwest, over very varied country.  While the late Mr. Hassard Short himself\r\nresided here, he had frequently coursing parties, hares being then very\r\nplentiful, to which, among others, the present writer, as a boy, and his\r\nfather, were always invited.  This residence was, however, pulled down\r\nsometime “in the fifties,” the owner, for the sake of his health,\r\npreferring to reside in the south.  It was for a time, however, occupied\r\nby a Mrs. Heald, {34b} and her nephew George Heald, Esq., a fine-looking\r\nyoung fellow, who held a commission in the Guards.  And hereby hangs a\r\ntale.  In riding in the Park, in London, he made the acquaintance of the\r\nfamous coquette, and adventuress, Lola Montez, created Countess of\r\nLandsfeldt by the King of Hanover, whose mistress she was.  Being a\r\nmixture of Spanish and Irish blood, she possessed all the vivacity of\r\nboth those races, with a gay dash in her manners, and considerable\r\nbeauty, along with an extremely outré style of dress.  Thus she\r\nfascinated the young man, as she previously had done her late Royal\r\nMaster.  He married her, although she was said to have been already\r\nmarried to a Captain James.  The charm soon lost its power, and as a\r\nmeans of ridding himself of her, his friends prosecuted her for bigamy.\r\nSergeant Ballantine in his autobiography gives the whole particulars\r\n(vol. II., p. 106), but he does not remember the result of this action.\r\nShe was of a temper so violent, that she commonly carried arms, and was\r\nalmost reckless of what she did.  Young Heald came at length to live in\r\nalmost hourly fear for his life.  I well remember his coming down to a\r\nhotel at Horncastle, to receive rents; when he sat at table, with a\r\nloaded pistol at each side of him.  I knew him and his aunt well, and\r\nfrom the latter I received many kindnesses.  The poor persecuted young\r\nman soon passed from mortal ken; but the lady migrated to America, to\r\nseek higher game once more; but a fracas having occurred, in which she\r\nshot someone in a railway carriage, her career also was brought to a\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nThe earliest mention which we have of this part of the Manor of\r\nEdlington, is as being part of the Barony of Gilbert de Gaunt (some of\r\nthat name, still residing as farmers in the parish).  He probably, or his\r\nancestors, acquired the property, from what was a common source, in that\r\nday, viz., from the great Norman Baron, Ivo Taillebois, on whom William\r\nthe Conqueror bestowed the rich Saxon heiress, the Lady Lucia, the\r\nrepresentative of the wealthy family of the Thorolds, and near relative\r\nof King Harold (see my records of Old Bolingbroke).  He held this Manor\r\ntill about the year 35 Ed. I., or A.D. 1307.  It then passed to the\r\nBarkeworthes; Robert de Barkeworthe being the first of them to reside in\r\nthe parish, as owner of Poolham.  They were a family of wealth and\r\nposition in the neighbourhood at that period.  There is a legal document\r\ncalled Feet of Fines (file 98 [39]), of date A.D. 1329, in which William\r\nde Barkeworthe, and ffloriana his wife, on the one part, and Robert de\r\nHaney and Alice his wife, on the other part, lay claim to considerable\r\nproperty, in Claxby, Normanby and Ussylby, in which the former establish\r\ntheir claim.  In 1351, William de Barkeworthe presented to a moiety of\r\nthe chapelry of Polum.  But in 1369, Thomas de Thymbelby presented.  This\r\nmarks the period when the property passed from the Barkeworthes to the\r\nThimblebys.  A Walter de Barkeworthe died in 1347, and was buried in the\r\nCloister of Lincoln Cathedral.  At the period of this transition (1369),\r\nanother Feet of Fines exists, between Thomas, son of Nicholas de\r\nThymelby, with several others, on the one part, and Richard, “son of\r\nSimon atte See,” on the other part, by which the said Richard surrenders\r\nlands in Claxby, Normanby, Tetford, and other property, to the said\r\nThomas, son of Nicholas de Thymelby and his friends (“Architectural Soc.\r\nJourn.,” vol. XXIII., p. 255).  There is another Feet of Fines, in 1374,\r\nbetween Thomas de Themelby, John de Themelby, Parson, and others, on the\r\none part, and John de Toutheby, and his wife Alianora, on the other part,\r\nwhich assigns the Manor of Tetford, and advowson of the church, to the\r\nThymelbys.  In 1388, John, son of Thomas de Thymelby, presented to\r\nTetford.  The Thimbleby pedigree is given in the Herald’s Visitation of\r\n1562.\r\n\r\nIn 1333, at a Chancery Inquisition, held at Haltham, “on Friday next,\r\nafter the feast of St. Matthew,” the Jurors declare, that Nicholas de\r\nThymelby, and his wife Matilda, hold land in Haltham, of the right of the\r\nsaid Matilda, under the Lord the King, as parcel of the Manor of\r\nScrivelsby; also that the said Nicholas held land in Stikeswold, of the\r\nDean and Chapter of Lincoln, by the service of paying them ijs and vid\r\nyearly; and also that he held lands in Thymelby, under the Bishop of\r\nCarlisle.  Further inquisitions show that Nicholas de Thymelby, and John,\r\nhis brother, also held lands in Horncastle and over (_i.e._ High)\r\nToynton, under the said Bishop of Carlisle; that Thomas de Thymelby\r\npresented to the Church of Ruckland in 1381; and that John, his son,\r\npresented to the Church of Tetford, April 4th, 1388.  In 1427, it was\r\nfound that the heirs of John de Thymelby, held by their trustees, lands\r\n“in Polum and Edlynton.”\r\n\r\nIn 1439, William Thymelby, Esq., Lord of Polum, presented to the Benefice\r\nof Somersby, having already presented to Tetford.  He seems to have\r\nmarried Joan, daughter of Sir Walter Tailboys, a descendant of the same\r\nfamily, from which sprang Ivo Taillebois, the great Norman Baron,\r\npreviously mentioned, from whom Gilbert de Gaunt probably acquired his\r\nland in Edlington. {37a}  Richard Thimbleby, in 1474, obtained the\r\nBeelsby estates, through marriage with Elizabeth, daughter and heir of\r\nSir Thomas Beelsby, knight, and widow of Sir John Pygot, Knt.  He died\r\n(1522) possessed (in right of his wife, who was coheir of Godfrey\r\nHilton), of the Manors of Beelsby, Holton-le-Moor, Horsington, Harpswell,\r\nHarleston, Thorgansby; and a share of the advowson of Horsington; John\r\nThymelby, his son, succeeded him (Escheator’s Inquisitions, 14 H.S., No.\r\n24).  To show the religious fanaticism in the reign of Elizabeth, even\r\namong Protestants, note the following:—A Thimbleby of Poolham, A.D. 1581,\r\nwas thrown into prison by the Bishop of Lincoln (T. Cowper), for refusing\r\nto attend Protestant services.  His wife was near her confinement, but\r\nshe begged to see her husband, she was treated so roughly that the pains\r\nof labour seized her in her husband’s dungeon.  She was nevertheless\r\ndetained in prison without any nurse or assistant, and a speedy death\r\nfollowed; her husband also dying soon afterwards in prison from the rough\r\ntreatment which he underwent there.  (“The Church under Queen Elizabeth,”\r\nby F. G. Lee, II. p. 60).  I have given these details to show the\r\nimportance of the family of Thimbleby.\r\n\r\nAfter another generation or two, Matthew Thymbleby’s widow of Poolham,\r\nmarried Sir Robert Saville, Knt., who, through her, died possessed of the\r\nManors of Poolham, Edlington, and several more.  Confining ourselves here\r\nto Poolham, we find the Saviles, who were members of the Saviles of\r\nHowley, co. York (now represented by Lord Mexborough, of Methley, co.\r\nYork, etc., etc., and the Saviles, of Rufford Abbey, co. Notts.),\r\ncontinuing to own Poolham until 1600, when Sir John Saville, Knt., sold\r\nit to George Bolles, Esq., citizen of London, whose descendant, Sir John\r\nBolles, {37b} Bart., sold it to Sir Edmund Turnor, of Stoke Rochford.  It\r\nhas recently been sold to Dr. Byron, residing in London.\r\n\r\nAs we have, thus far, chiefly confined ourselves to the owners of the\r\nhamlet of Poolham, we will now make some rather interesting remarks upon\r\nthe old Poolham Hall, and matters connected with it.  The old mansion was\r\nprobably built originally on a larger scale than the present farm house.\r\nIt is enclosed by a moat, in the south-west angle of which stand the\r\nremains of a chapel, or oratory, now in the kitchen garden; they consist\r\nof an end wall and part of a side wall, each with a narrow window.  The\r\nfont, a few years ago, was taken away, and in order to preserve it from\r\ndestruction, it was placed, some twenty years ago, in the garden of\r\nWispington Vicarage, by the Vicar (the late Rev. C. P. Terrot), a great\r\necclesiastical antiquarian.  It has further again been removed by the\r\npresent writer, and, on the restoration of the Church of St. Margaret, at\r\nWoodhall, in 1893, it was once more restored to its original purpose, as\r\nfont in that Church, being further adorned by four handsome columns of\r\nserpentine, the gift of the Rev. J. A. Penny, the present Vicar of\r\nWispington.  Near the chapel, there was till recently, a tombstone,\r\nbearing date 1527.  This stone was a few years ago removed, and now forms\r\nthe sill of a cottage doorway in Stixwould.  The writer should here add\r\nthat, on the moat of this old Hall being cleaned out a few years ago,\r\nthere was found in the mud, beneath the chapel ruins, a curious object,\r\nwhich at once passed into his possession.  It proved to be an ancient\r\nchrismatory, of which there has never been found the like.  The material\r\nis terra cotta, with peculiar primitive ornamentation, of a pale stone\r\ncolour, containing two divisions, or wells, with spouts at each end, each\r\nhaving been covered with a roof, although one of them is now broken off,\r\ncuriously carved.  The use of the chrismatory, was, in mediæval times,\r\nconnected with baptism; as the child was brought into the church, it was\r\nsprinkled with salt, and at the font it was anointed with oil.  The two\r\nwells were meant to hold the salt and oil.  As I have said, it is unique.\r\nIts use was first explained to me, by Sir Augustus Franks, of the British\r\nMuseum.  It has been exhibited among the ecclesiastical objects of art at\r\nthe Church Congresses, at Norwich, London, Newcastle, Northampton, and\r\nother places.  It has created very great interest, and has been noticed\r\nin various publications.  According to Ecton’s “Thesaurus,” this chapel\r\nwas connected with Bardney Abbey, but it is now a ruin, and unused.  The\r\npopulation is limited to three houses, and the most convenient place of\r\nworship is Woodhall, St. Margaret’s.\r\n\r\nWe will now revert more especially to Edlington.  We have mentioned\r\nGilbert de Gaunt as among the first owners, but this applies, more\r\nstrictly to the hamlet Poolham.  Edlington proper, is evidently a place\r\nof great antiquity, the name is derived from “Eiddeleg,” a deity in the\r\nBardic Mythology (Dr. Oliver’s “Religious Houses on the Witham”); the\r\nwhole name meaning the town of Eiddeleg.  In connection with this, we may\r\nmention that, until about three years ago, when it was destroyed by\r\ndynamite, there existed an enormous boulder, standing on a rising ground,\r\nabout sixty yards from the present highway, on the farm of Mr. Robert\r\nSearby, which weighed about 10 tons, its height being about 10ft., width\r\n4ft. 6in., and its thickness about 3ft.  This would be just the Druidic\r\naltar, at which the Bardic mysteries, in the British period, might be\r\ncelebrated.  In 1819, while digging a field in Edlington, some men found\r\nseveral heaps of ox bones, and with each heap an urn of baked clay.\r\nUnfortunately none of these urns were preserved, so that we are unable to\r\nsay whether they were of Roman make, or of earlier date.  They imply\r\nheathen sacrifice of some kind, and were close to a Roman road; still the\r\nexistence, already mentioned, of an earlier Bardic worship, would favour\r\nfor them, an earlier origin.\r\n\r\nFrom Domesday Book (completed circa 1086), we gather (1st) that among the\r\npossessions of the King (William the Conqueror), there were 4 carucates,\r\n_i.e._ 480 acres of land, with proportionate sokemen, villeins, and\r\nbordars.  The whole land of the parish being reckoned at 6,960 acres.  Of\r\nthis extent, the Saxon Ulf, so often mentioned as an owner in this\r\nneighbourhood, had 10 carucates (or 1,200 acres).  Egbert, the vassal of\r\nGilbert de Gaunt had 480 acres, a mill, always a valuable possession, as\r\nall dependants were bound to have their grain ground there; 90 acres of\r\nmeadow, and 210 acres of wood land, in all 780 acres.  A Jury of the\r\nwapentake of Horncastle, declared that the powerful noble Robert\r\nDespenser, wrongfully disputed the claim of Gilbert de Gaunt, to half a\r\ncarucate, or 60 acres, in Edlington, which in the time of Edward the\r\nConfessor had been formerly held by one Saxon, Tonna.\r\n\r\nEdlington was one of the 222 parishes in the county which had churches\r\nbefore the Norman conquest, but as the number of priests serving these\r\nchurches was only 131, it is doubtful whether it had a resident minister,\r\nit being more probably that it was served by a Monk of Bardney Abbey, to\r\nwhich (according to Liber Regis) it was attached.  Here again we have a\r\ntrace of Gilbert de Gaunt being Lord of the Manor of Edlington, as well\r\nas of the subdivision of Poolham.  The Monastery of Bardney was\r\noriginally one of the few Saxon foundations, and established before the\r\nyear 697.  It was however reduced to great poverty by the Danes, under\r\nInguar and Hubba, in 870, 300 monks being slain.  It remained in ruins\r\nsome 200 years, when it was restored by Gilbert de Gaunt, who succeeded\r\nto some of the property of Ulf, the Saxon Thane, already named.  Gilbert\r\nde Gaunt had 54 Manors conferred upon him; being nephew of the Conqueror,\r\nand among the several which he bestowed on Bardney, was Edlington.  At\r\nthe dissolution, it would revert to the King, and (as we are here reduced\r\nto conjecture), we may well suppose that it was one of the many Manors in\r\nthis district conferred by Henry VIII., on Charles Brandon, Duke of\r\nSuffolk, among whose descendants these vast possessions were subsequently\r\ndivided.  In Dr. Oliver’s learned book on the “Religious Houses on the\r\nWitham,” it is stated that Bardney had land in Edlington, that the abbot\r\nhad the advowson of the benefice, and that before the King’s Justices, in\r\nthe reign of Ed. I., the abbot proved his right, by act of Henry I.,\r\nconfirmed by Henry III. to the exercise of “Infangthef, pit, and gallows\r\nat Bardney.”\r\n\r\nIn “Placito de Warranto,” p. 409, he claimed, and proved his right, also\r\nto a gallows at Edlington (as well as at Hagworthingham, and Steeping,\r\nand Candlesby); and in connection with this, it is interesting to note\r\nthat, as at Bardney, there is a field called “Coney Garth” (Konig Garth),\r\nor King enclosure, where the abbot’s gallows stood; so at Edlington there\r\nis a field (the grass field, in the angle, as you pass from the village\r\nroad to the high road, leading northward), which is still called “Coney\r\nGreen,” which name moderns of small education, suppose to be derived from\r\nthe numbers of conies, _i.e._ rabbits, which abound there; but in which\r\nthe antiquarian sees the old Konig-field, the King’s enclosure; and in\r\nthat field, doubtless, stood the abbot of Bardney’s gallows; {41} just as\r\nthe Abbots of Kirkstead had a gallows in Thimbleby.  On this Edlington\r\nConey Green, I have found bricks of an early style, with various mounds\r\nand hollows, indicating buildings of some extent, and probably belonging\r\nto the King.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1897, the Rev. J. A. Penny, Vicar of Wispington, discovered\r\nand published in “Linc. N. and Q.,” some very interesting Bardney\r\ncharters of the 13th century, which make many mentions of Edlington.  In\r\none case they record the gift of a bondman, and his progeny to Thomas de\r\nThorley, living in Gautby, the slave being William, son of Peter\r\nHardigrey, of Edlington; among the witnesses to the deed of gift being\r\nMaster Robert, of Poolham, Simon, the Chamberlain of Edlington, and\r\nothers.  Date, 22nd May, 1281.\r\n\r\nAnother is a declaration of Thomas de Thorley, living in Gautby, that he\r\ngrants to Master William Hardegrey, Rector of Mareham, all the lands and\r\ntenements which he owns in the village and fields of Edlington; among the\r\nwitnesses being Simon, son of John, the Chamberlain of Edlington; Richard\r\nKing of the same, Simon the Francis of Edlington, and others.\r\n\r\nAnother charter states that, “I, William, son of William of Wispington,\r\nhave granted, and by this deed confirmed, the gift, to William Hardigrey,\r\nof Edlington, clerk, all my toft, with its buildings, lying in the parish\r\nof Edlington, which is situate between the public highway, and the croft\r\nof Richard, son of Henry King, for ever.  Among the witnesses being\r\nSimon, the Chamberlain of Edlington, John, his son, Alured of Woodhall,\r\nand others.  Given at Edlington, the Wednesday after Michaelmas, A.D.\r\n1285.  (30th Sep., 1285), and 13th year of the reign of King Edward I.”\r\n\r\nWe further get disconnected notices of various owners of, or in,\r\nEdlington, but I can not make out a connected series.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in a Chancery Inquisition, 13. Ed. I. (12th May, 1285),\r\nheld by order of the King, among the jurors are Henry of Horsington,\r\nRobert, son of the Parson of Horsington, Hugh Fraunklyn, of Langton,\r\nWilliam de Wodehall, of Edlington, and others.  Thus the William de\r\nWoodhall, already named, was a proprietor in Edlington, as early as 1285.\r\n\r\nWe find, in a Final Concord, Nov. 22nd, 1208 (three-quarters of a century\r\nearlier than the preceding), between Andrew, of Edlington, plaintiff, and\r\nAlice, daughter of Elvina, who acted for her, the said Andrew\r\nacknowledged the said Alice to be free (he had probably claimed her as a\r\nbond-slave, in his house, or on his land, at Edlington), for which Alice\r\ngave him one mark.  It was only in the reign of Henry VI. that a servant\r\nwas permitted, after giving due notice to leave his place, and take the\r\nservices of another (23. Hen. VI. c. 13).  Before that, all were the\r\nproperty of their owners, unless given their freedom for some special\r\nreason.  Here is another proprietor in a dispute, on 10th Nov., 1208,\r\nbetween Thorold, of Horsington on the one part, and John, son of Simon,\r\nof Edlington.  The said Thorold surrendered for ever, certain lands in\r\nEdlington, to John and his heirs, another family of proprietors, at the\r\nsame date as the previous.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1218, in a Final Concord, between John, of Edlington, and\r\nHugh, his tenant, as to the right to certain lands in Edlington, it was\r\nagreed that John was the rightful owner, and for this, John granted Hugh\r\ncertain other lands, but in case Hugh died without issue, they were to\r\nrevert to John, of Edlington.  He would seem, therefore, to have been\r\nrather a large proprietor.\r\n\r\nThe will of Richard Evington, of Halsteade Hall, was made, on 22nd\r\nJanuary, 1612, by which he leaves his lands in Edlington, and other\r\nplaces, to his two sons, Maurice and Nicholas Evington.\r\n\r\nOn 23rd December, 1616, Edward Turnor, clerk, of Edlington, made his\r\nwill, the details of which do not here concern us, beyond showing that he\r\nwas Vicar.\r\n\r\nThe parish register dates from 1562, beginning with Thomas fforeman, the\r\nsonne of William fforeman, christened 2nd February, 1562.  This register\r\nis very peculiar, as it gives the baptisms down to 1700, then the\r\nmarriages from and to the same dates, then the burials from and to the\r\nsame dates.  This is very unusual, the common arrangement, in those\r\ntimes, being to give the baptisms, marriages, and burials under the same\r\ndates all together.  The present book is the copy on paper, of the\r\noriginal on parchment or vellum.  Among some of the surnames are\r\nBillinghay, Padison, Melborn, fford, Hollywell, Kaksby, Stanley, Gunby,\r\nBrinkels (Brinkhills), William, son of Thomas Bounsayne, gent., bap.\r\nJany. 12th, 1605.  Margaret, daughter of John Elton, gent. (and a\r\nsister), baptized October 29th, 1611; and Siorach Edmonds, Vicar, 1617.\r\nMary, the daughter of Robert Brookley, gent., bapt. Nov. 2nd, 1652; with\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThis list shews a considerable number of landed proprietors in the\r\nparish; there being no one pre-eminent landowner.\r\n\r\nAmong the Christian names, which occur in the oldest register, are\r\nBridgett, Muriall, Rowland, Judith, Dorothie, Anthony, Hamond, Cicilie,\r\nand others.\r\n\r\nGeorge Hamerton, gent., and Sarah Hussey, were married June 21st, 1699.\r\n[These Hamertons were a wealthy family in Horncastle, owning a large\r\nblock of houses at the junction of the east and south streets.  The\r\ninitials of John Hamerton and his wife, remain there, over the\r\nfire-place, in an oak-pannelled room.  I believe they were connected with\r\nthe Hamertons, of Hamerton, co. York.]\r\n\r\nJohn Corbet and Isabell Thylley were married, December 6th, 1660.  [The\r\nCorbets have been a long-established family in Lincolnshire, and also\r\ntaking a leading position in Shropshire, in Sir Andrew Corbett, Bart].\r\nIn register III., is a note, “Thomas Barnett, of Thimbelby, found dead in\r\nEdlington parish, and was buried Sep. 6th, 1798”; also, “Deborah Bell,\r\naged 95, buried November 7th, 1804.”\r\n\r\nIn the 2nd register book, among other entries are these:—The Rev.\r\nTristram Sturdivant, Vicar, buried August 3rd, 1755.  (The clerk, William\r\nBlow, had died 2 years before).  Belmirah, daughter of Thos. Clarke of\r\nHorncastle, and Mary, his wife, buried Feb. 23rd, 1773.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd register has the following:—Mr. Wells’ youngest child (of\r\nPoolham), christened by me, William Wells, at Poolham, baptized by Mr.\r\nL’Oste (then Vicar), at Woodhall Church, named Charles, Aug. 11, 1794.\r\n[The Wells’ resided at Poolham down to about 1850.  They were wealthy\r\ngentlemen farmers, and were most generous to the poor, and supported the\r\nchurch in every possible way, as I know from my own experience, and that\r\nof my father].\r\n\r\nMargaret Spencer, a traveller, commonly called “Scotch Peg,” she being a\r\nScotch woman, was buried (at Edlington), Sept. 2, 1789.  In the 2nd\r\nRegister again we have, among the surnames, Greenland, Walesby, Bouchier,\r\nSoulby, Bates, Longstaffe, Falkner, Bullifant, Gaunt, Elsey, Sturdivant,\r\nBontoft, Darwin, and others.\r\n\r\nWe have just mentioned the name of Soulby.  I find from the returns made\r\nby Government, that Charles Soulby, and his brother Edward, both payed\r\nthe tax for male servants, the former for 2, the latter for 1, in the\r\nyear 1780.\r\n\r\nAmong the Gentry of Lincolnshire, a list of whom was made by the Royal\r\nHeralds in the year 1634, is Thomas Tokyng, of Edlington, with Ambrose\r\nSheppard, of Hemingby, Robert and John Sherard, of Gautby, Thomas Morgan,\r\nEsq., of Scrivelsby, &c., &c.  John Rolt, of Edlington, declined the\r\nhonour, there being some slight “duty” chargeable on the distinction.\r\n\r\nRalph Palframan, clerk, was presented to the Benefice of Edlington, by\r\nhis brother Anthony, merchant of the staple, at Lincoln, by an assignment\r\nof the advowson made for this turn by the late Abbot of Bardney.  William\r\nPalfreyman was Mayor of Lincoln in 1536, probably the father.  He was\r\ninstituted A.D. 1569, on the demise of Leonard Nurse.  “Architect, Soc.\r\nJourn.,” vol. xxiv., p. 15.\r\n\r\nThe Church of Edlington is dedicated to St. Helen, the mother of the\r\nEmperor Constantine, who was, by birth, a Yorkshire woman.  The edifice\r\nwas re-built, with the exception of the lowest part of the tower, in\r\n1859–60, at a cost of £1146.  It consists of a nave, south aisle,\r\nchancel, and substantial tower of 3 tiers, with 3 bells.  The font is\r\nsquare at the base, octagonal above.  The tower arch at the west end is\r\nthe original Norman, and the only part remaining of the original\r\nbuilding.  The upper part of the tower is in the Early English style.\r\nThe windows in the tower are copies of the former Early English ones, the\r\nsouth arcade is perpendicular, with windows in the same style, and\r\nconsisting of 3 bays, with octagonal columns.  The Chancel Arch is of\r\ngood Early English style.  There is a good coloured two-light window,\r\nnear the pulpit, in memory of Margaret, the wife of J. Hassard Short,\r\nEsq., who died Feb. 2nd, 1881.  The subject of this window is the three\r\nMaries, and the Angel, at the Sepulchre; combined with his wife, he also\r\nby the same window, commemorated his daughter, Agnes Margarette, who died\r\n17th Dec., 1867.  Another coloured window was placed in the Church in\r\nDecember, 1900, in memory of the late Squire, the subject being the\r\nSaviour appearing to Mary Magdalene, at the Sepulchre.  Both figures are\r\nof life-size, the countenances being full of expression.  It was designed\r\nby Messrs. Heaton and Butler, and placed in position by Mr. C. Hensman,\r\nof Horncastle; and forms a fitting companion to the window in memory of\r\nhis wife.  It bears the inscription, “To the glory of God, in loving\r\nmemory of John Hassard Short, Esq., who died Dec. 4, 1893, this window is\r\nerected by his daughter Marian.”  The Shorts have held this estate for\r\nfour generations.  The flooring is laid with Minton tiles, the church is\r\nfitted with open benches, and pulpit of oak, with reading desk and\r\nlectern of the same.  These were the gift of the Lay Impropriators of the\r\nBenefice, the Trustees of Oakham and Uppingham Schools.  The organ is by\r\nStephenson, of Lincoln.  The inscription on the 3 bells (according to\r\nNorth, in his “Lincolnshire Bells”), 2 Royal Heads on each, Edwd. I., and\r\nQueen Eleanor; Edwd. III. and Queen Philippa; Henry VI. and Margaret of\r\nAnjou.  Further details are given, as that Edlington had, in 1553, “three\r\nbig bells and a Priest’s bell.”  Inscriptions now, on 1st bell “1824,”\r\n2nd bell “I.H.S. Sancte Peter,” with diameter of 34 inches; 3rd bell\r\n“I.H.S., Sancte Paule”; Priest’s bell, “T.L. TFCW., 1670,” with diameter\r\n11½ inches.\r\n\r\nThere have been at least 5 Vicars within the last 50 years.  The present\r\nVicar, is the Rev. E. H. Bree, formerly Curate of Belchford, who has a\r\ngood and commodious residence and premises, recently enlarged, and good\r\ngarden, pleasantly situated close to the Park.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the former old Residence of the Shorts was pulled down\r\nseveral years ago; no building has been erected on the same scale or site\r\nsince, but a farm house was adopted as a shooting box, for members of the\r\nfamily; and for the last three or four years this has been occupied by J.\r\nR. Hatfeild, Esq., who rents the shooting.  The Benefice is in the gift\r\nof the Lord Chancellor, as representing the former Patron, the King.\r\n\r\nSmall as is the parish of Edlington, it has seen some stirring scenes.\r\nOn the day before the Battle of Winceby, near Horncastle, where the\r\nRoyalists were defeated by Cromwell, viz., on the Evening of Tuesday,\r\nOct. 10, 1643, a troop of Parliamentary Horse, commanded by Capt. Samuel\r\nMoody, were surprised at Edlington, by the King’s forces, under the\r\ncommand of Sir John Henderson and Lord Widdrington, of Blankney, and\r\nthere befell a rather sharp skirmish, in which the Parliamentary troops\r\nhad to fall back.  Such was one violation of the quietude of the little\r\nvillage.  In older times, lying as it did, between the two Roman forts of\r\nBanovallum (or Cornucastrum) and the ancient Lindum (or Lincoln), it\r\nwould often, in the time of the Roman occupation of the country, be\r\ndisturbed by the heavy tread of Roman Legions, and the accompanying music\r\nof Roman Clarions.\r\n\r\nHistory also tells us that “in the year of our Lord, 1406, Sept. 12, King\r\nHenry IV. made a Royal procession from the town of Horncastle, with a\r\ngreat and honourable company, to the Abbey of Bardney, where the Abbot\r\nand Monastery came out, in ecclesiastical state, to meet him,” [Leland’s\r\n“Collectanea”].  As by-roads did not exist, as they do now, we can hardly\r\ndoubt, that his line of route would be by the King’s highway, through\r\nEdlington.\r\n\r\nSurely, even in these days of easy locomotion, it can have fallen to the\r\nlot of few villages, large or small, to have given to the gaze of their\r\nrustic wondering inhabitants, such varied, and unusual scenes as these.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAVIS ENDERBY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMavis Enderby is nearly 8 miles from Horncastle, in an easterly\r\ndirection, the road passing through High Toynton, skirting Scrafield, and\r\nthrough Winceby, and Lusby, and being part of the old Roman road from\r\nDoncaster to Wainfleet.  It is about 3 miles west by north of Spilsby,\r\nwhere is the nearest telegraph office; the nearest money order office\r\nbeing at Raithby.  Letters, via Spilsby, arrive at 7.30 a.m.  The village\r\nis prettily situated on a slope of the wolds, the houses clustering about\r\nthe church, except solitary farm residences of a substantial kind; the\r\nparish is roughly divided into Northfield and Southfield.  To the north\r\nformerly stood a religious house, a dependency of Revesby Abbey.  It was\r\nlast occupied by C. J. H. Massingberd Mundy, Esq.  It fell into decay\r\nsome years ago, and nothing now remains of it, beyond the turf-covered\r\nfoundations and some fine yew-trees, apparently survivals of a former\r\navenue leading to it.  A varied view is seen to the north-east, towards\r\nAswardby and Langton, including the wooded height of Harrington Hill, and\r\nother elevated ground, with the graceful spire of Sausethorpe church\r\nconspicuous in the intervening valley, one of the most successful\r\ncreations of the Architect, Stephen Lewin, who, fifty years ago, did some\r\ngood work among our Lincolnshire churches, notably in his restoration of\r\nSwineshead, and his re-building of Brothertoft.  The stranger might, by\r\nthe name of this parish, be reminded of the lines of Sir Walter Scott.\r\n{47a}\r\n\r\n    Merry it is in the good green woods,\r\n       When the Mavis {47b} and Merle {47c} are singing,\r\n    When the deer sweep by, and the hounds are in cry,\r\n       And the hunter’s horn is ringing.\r\n\r\nBut no groves or hedgerows vocal with their songsters, gave the parish\r\nits name.  The Lord of the Manor, in the 12th century was Richard de\r\nMalbyse, or Malbishe, a large proprietor, and exercising considerable\r\ninfluence in this neighbourhood, and elsewhere.  The epithet has been\r\nretained to distinguish this from Bag Enderby, and Wood Enderby; one of\r\nwhich is near and the other not far away.  The name Malbyse or Malbishe,\r\nmeans, in old Norman French, an evil beast (compare Bis-on); and the arms\r\nof the family, as still preserved at Acaster Malbis, near York, once\r\nbelonging to a member of the family, are a chevron, with three wild stags\r\nheads “erased,” _i.e._, raggedly severed from the body.\r\n\r\nDomesday Book, however, tells us of owners of land before the Malbyshes,\r\nin pre-Norman times.  The Saxon, Thane Elnod, held land in Mavis Enderby\r\nand Raithby and East Keal, in the reign of Edward the Confessor (p. 31)\r\n{47c}; while another Saxon, Godwin, whose name appears in connection with\r\nseveral other parishes, had the Manor of Mavis Enderby (p. 159) {47c}\r\nThe old hereditary owners of the lands met with no mercy from the\r\nConqueror, who had to provide for his Norman followers.  The historian\r\nrecords that as William passed along the ranks of his army before the\r\ngreat Battle of Hastings, he addressed them in a loud voice thus,\r\n“Remember to fight well, if we conquer we shall be rich, if I take this\r\nland, you will have it among you,” and the promise then held out, was\r\namply fulfilled; the vanquished Saxons were robbed of their lands, to\r\nreward William’s favorites who had capacious maws.  Among those rewarded\r\nextensively with plundered territory, was William de Karilepho,\r\nconsecrated Bishop of Durham in 1082, and also made Chief Justice of\r\nEngland; he received grants of land in Mavis Enderby, Raithby, Spilsby,\r\nHundleby, Grebby, and many other places.  Ivo Taillebois (equivalent to\r\nthe modern Underwood), who was then leader of the Angevin Auxiliaries of\r\nthe Conqueror, also received very extensive grants; among them being\r\nlands in Mavis Enderby, Raithby, Hareby, Halton Holgate, Asgarby,\r\nMiningsby and many other demesnes.  About the same time also (1070),\r\nanother of the Conqueror’s favourites Eudo—son of Spirewic, subsequently\r\nthe founder of the Tattershall family, received very extensive domains,\r\namong them being the Manor of Mavis Enderby, a Berewick (or smaller\r\noutlying portion) in Raithby, another in Hundleby, and in the two Keals,\r\nHagnaby, and endless more possessions, his head-quarters being at\r\nTattershall, all of which he held “in capite” or directly of the King.\r\nBut, as we have repeatedly observed in these notes, these early Norman\r\ntenures were precarious, they were acquired by violence, and when the\r\nhand that held them waxed feeble, a stronger hand, in turn, took\r\npossession.  Mavis Enderby, like very many other parishes, became an\r\nappurtenance of the Manor, or Honor, of Bolingbroke, and throughout that\r\ngreat appanage of the Crown there were many changes in the Lords of\r\ndemesnes.\r\n\r\nThe first of the Malbishes, whose name is recorded, is Osbert Malbishe,\r\nwho, with others, is witness to a charter of Revesby Abbey, of date 1173;\r\nthis probably is accounted for by the fact of there being a cell of\r\nRevesby Abbey at Mavis Enderby.  Another Malbishe, William, also\r\nwitnesses another Revesby charter in 1216.  Both these lived before the\r\nRichard Malbishe who is generally referred to as being the Lord of the\r\nManor, whose name became attached to the parish.\r\n\r\nAmong the “Final Concords” (p. 162), we find it recorded, that in a deed,\r\ndated 5th June, 1222, Matilda, wife of the above William Malebisse,\r\nclaimed certain lands in Enderby (not yet specially designated “Mavis”),\r\nas her dower, but that through the agency of Robert de Wion, she\r\nquit-claimed all her rights to that particular portion in favour of one\r\nNicholas and his heirs, for which the said Nicholas gave her 20s.\r\n\r\nIn a Chancery Inquisition, 4 Edw. III., 1330, it is shown that the heirs\r\nof Alan Malbish hold certain lands in Sausthorpe and Langton; and another\r\nInquisition in 1352, mentions ¼ fee held in Sauzethorpe and Langton,\r\nwhich the heirs of Alan Malbish hold.  (“Archit. S. Journ.,” 1894, p.\r\n170.)\r\n\r\nAfter this we hear nothing more of the Malbishe family.  But in a\r\nChancery Inquisition post-mortem, 18 Henry VII., No. 34, taken at “Est\r\nRasen, 26th October, 1502, after the death of Thomas Fitzwilliam, heir of\r\nSir Thomas Fitzwilliam, Knight, lately deceased,” it is stated that John\r\nVere, Earl of Oxford, Sir Robert Dymmok, Knight, Robert Rede, Justice of\r\nthe Lord the King, Thomas Chaloner, and others, were seized of the fee of\r\nthe Manors of Malburssh Enderby, Maydinwell, Malberthorp, etc., with\r\ntheir appurtenances (which are described as extensive) to the use of the\r\nheirs male of the said Sir Thomas Fitzwilliam lawfully begotten, and the\r\nJurors further say, that the Manor of Malburssh Enderby, with\r\nappurtenances, etc., are held of the Lord the King, of the Duchy of\r\nLancaster, as of his Manor of Bolingbroke, and that certain lands are\r\nheld of Sir George Taylboys (doubtless a descendent of Ivo Taillebois,\r\nowner in the days of the Conqueror), but by what services they do not\r\nknow.  (“Architect. Soc. Journ.” 1895, p. 14).\r\n\r\nThe Fitzwilliams still held lands in Mablethorp in the reign of Henry\r\nVIII.  One of the family, Sir William Fitzwilliam was Lord High Admiral,\r\nand a staunch supporter of the King in the rebellion of 1536.  Only two\r\nyears later, in an Inquisition, 20 Henry VII., No. 14 (January 31,\r\n1504–5).  After the death of George Gedney, it is stated that a certain\r\nJohn Billesby (of Billesby) {49} and Nicholas Eland were seized of the\r\nManor of Mabysshenderby, with appurtenances, as well as lands in\r\nHagworthynham, Bag Enderby, Holbeche, Fleet, and Swaby, and that they\r\nenfeoffed the said George Gedney and Anne his wife of the aforesaid\r\nManors, to them and their heirs for ever.  The Gedneys continued for many\r\ngenerations an influential family in the neighbourhood.  Andrew Gedney,\r\nof Bag Enderby, married Dorothy, daughter of Sir William Skipwith, of\r\nSouth Ormsby, 1536; and within recent years Arthur P. Gedney, Esq. (a\r\ncousin of the writer of these notes), owned the Manor of Candlesby, and\r\nresided at Candlesby Hall.  (“Arch. S. Journ.,” 1895, page 27.)\r\n\r\nIn an Inquisition p.m. in the same year No. 52, after the death of the\r\nsaid Anne, wife of George Gedney, much of this is repeated, but it is\r\nfurther specified that the property in Hagworthingham is held of the\r\nAbbot of Bardney; some in Bag Enderby is held of the Warden of Tateshale,\r\nsome in Holbeche of the Lady Dacre de la South, and some in Flete of the\r\nLord Fitz Water; that the said Anne died on the Saturday after the feast\r\nof the Holy Trinity, and that John Gedney is son and next heir.  In a\r\ndeed of 14 June, 1535, John Gedney, of Bag Enderby, refers to his wife’s\r\njointure of lands in Mavis Enderby and other parishes; the said wife\r\nbeing Isabel, heiress of the Enderbies of Bag Enderby.\r\n\r\nIn the register of Mavis Enderby, one book of which extends from 1579 to\r\n1772, an entry shows that George Lilbourne was Rector from 1522 to 1588,\r\nor 66 years.  He was a relative of the Smyths of Elkington, near Louth,\r\nwho are still represented in the two parishes of North and South\r\nElkington, as is shown by his will, dated 5th July, 1587 (Lincolnshire\r\nWills), in which he requests that he may be buried on the north side of\r\nthe chancel, bequeathing “to my niece Lacon, my niece Hansard, and my\r\nniece Simpson, an old English crown apiece; to Sir Edward Hustwaite, all\r\nthe books he hath of mine, and a great book of St. Gregory’s works, in\r\nthe hands of Sir Robert Welles, Parson of Howell; to my servant Agnes\r\nCressie, a silver spoon with akorne at the end of it; to George Smithe\r\n3li.; to Dorothy and Susan Smyth, 10s. apiece; to my nephew Herbert\r\nLacon, a macer (mazer or drinking bowl), lined with silver and gilt; to\r\nmy cousins Thomas Smithe and Anthony Smithe, and my nephew Tristram\r\nSmithe a little silver salt (cellar).  I make my nephew Herbert Lacon,\r\nand Mr. Thomas Taylor, supervisors.”  (Prob., 8 May, 1588).\r\n\r\nIt would appear that he was more generous in lending his books than his\r\nfriends were careful in returning them, the latter, a failing not unknown\r\nin our own day, and even St. Paul could write to Timothy (2 T. iv. 13),\r\n“Bring with thee the books, but especially the parchments.”\r\n\r\nAmong Lincolnshire Wills is one of Roger Metcalf, clerk of Mavis Enderby,\r\ndated 18 July, 1606, in which he desires to be buried in the chancel,\r\nJohn Downes of Lusby, clerk, being left executor, and George Littlebury\r\nof Somersby, Gent., and John Salmon of Haltham-on-Bain, clerk,\r\nsupervisors.  We thus see that in Saxon times, lands in Mavis Enderby and\r\nRaithby were held by the same owner, and that in early Norman times,\r\nlands in the two parishes were held more than once by the same Lord.  In\r\na Feet of Fines, Lincoln, file 68 (32), 30 Ed. I., there was a dispute\r\nbetween John Beck (of the ancient family of Bec, of Eresby, Lusby, etc.)\r\nand Robert de Wylgheby (ancestor of the Lords Willoughby) about the\r\nManors and advowsons of Enderby Malbys, and Ratheby, as well as other\r\nproperties, in which the said Robert granted to the said John the said\r\nlands and advowsons.  “Architect. S. Journal,” 1897, p. 56.  And in the\r\npresent day the two benefices are held together by the Rev. George Ward,\r\nwho is himself patron of Mavis Enderby, Raithby being in the gift of the\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\nEarly in the seventeenth century, the benefice was held by the Rev. James\r\nForrester, who was chaplain to Anne, Queen of James I., and wrote a\r\ncurious book, entitled “The Marrowe Juice of 260 Scriptures, or\r\nMonas-Tessera-Graphica”; printed at the signe of the crowne, in Paul’s\r\nchurchyard, 1611.\r\n\r\nThe head of one of our old and distinguished Lincolnshire families, Sir\r\nEdward Ascough, presented to the benefice in 1679 and 1685.  In 1734,\r\nDecimus Reynolds presented, and in 1782 Henry Best, Esq., presented.\r\n“Liber Regis.,” s.v., Malvis, alias Maurice, Enderby.\r\n\r\nThe present owners of the parish are Mrs. Rashdall of London, Mrs.\r\nColtman of Hagnaby, Mr. Holmes of Eastville, and the Rector.\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be said that the poem, by Miss Ingelow, of Boston, called\r\n“The Brides of Mavis Enderby,” has no connection with this parish, being\r\nentirely imaginary, except that it is founded on the fact of a high tide\r\non the Lincolnshire coast.  It was published in 1849, and Tennyson, the\r\nLaureate, much admired it.  “Life of Lord Tennyson,” Vol. I., p. 287.\r\nThe name was chosen as being euphonious.\r\n\r\nThe Church, dedicated to St. Michael, consists of tower, nave with south\r\naisle, and chancel.  The tower is of three stories.  In the western wall,\r\nabove the west door, is a three-light trefoiled perpendicular window,\r\nabove this a clock, above that a smaller three-light window, similar\r\nwindows being in all four faces.  The sill of the west door is an ancient\r\nstone, with the “Runic involuted knot” pattern, which, however, is almost\r\nobliterated by the tread of worshippers entering by the door.  It is\r\nsimilar to the Runic stone at Miningsby.  The church has been restored or\r\nrebuilt at various periods.  The tower, originally a lofty one, but a\r\nlarge part of which, through decay of the sandstone, had fallen down, was\r\npartly rebuilt in 1684, and a lower bell-chamber provided.  In 1894 it\r\nwas again restored, and carried up to its original height.  The chancel\r\nalso was rebuilt to its original length in 1871, and the nave, aisle, and\r\nporch were handsomely restored in 1878.  There are three bells.  On the\r\nsouth interior wall of the tower is an inscription on a tablet, recording\r\nthat the tower was restored and clock set up in 1894, in memory of four\r\ngenerations of the Ward family, “who were married in 1704, 1728, 1783,\r\n1836, G. Ward, F.S.A. (Rector), W. Sharpe (Churchwarden), their 23rd year\r\nof office together, C. Hodgson Fowler (Architect), Edwd. Bowman and Sons\r\n(Contractors).”\r\n\r\nIn the north wall of the nave is a door, two three-light trefoiled\r\nwindows, with two quatrefoils above.  The south aisle consists of three\r\nbays, one of the original sandstone pillars still remains in the north\r\ncorner of the west end, next to the tower wall, where there is also a\r\ntwo-light window behind the font.  In the south wall, east of the porch,\r\nare two windows of three lights, one of the decorated style, the other\r\nperpendicular, both square-headed.  The eastern one has coloured glass,\r\nby Clayton and Bell, the subjects being—in the centre the annunciation,\r\nto the east the angel appearing to Zacharias, to the west the visitation,\r\nadapted from the famous picture by Mariotto Albertinelli, in the Academy\r\nGallery, at Florence.  The seats are of modern oak, with carved\r\npoppy-heads, except one or two ancient ones preserved from an older\r\nstructure near the tower, and the roof throughout is of red deal.  There\r\nis a modern oak rood screen, with rood-loft, having standing figures of\r\nangels, one on each side, as well as one over the pulpit.  These were\r\noriginally in Louth church.  The pulpit and reading desk are of modern\r\noak.  The font is octagonal, decorated with plain Ogee arch on each face.\r\nThe south porch is modern, but having a curious old stoup, the pedestal\r\nbeing a cluster of early English columns, the bowl of a rather later\r\ndate, in keeping with the carving round the doorway; these have probably\r\nbeen imported from elsewhere.  The chancel, entirely modern, has a\r\nthree-light east window, both the tracery and coloured glass being\r\nadapted from a window in Louth church (where the Rector was formerly\r\nCurate), the glass being by Clayton and Bell, the tracery by the late Mr.\r\nJames Fowler of Louth.  The subjects are—below, the agony, crucifixion\r\nand entombment, and above, the annunciation, with six-winged cherubim on\r\neither side.  In the south wall are two windows of two lights, with\r\nquatrefoil above.  On the north is an organ chamber, with low wide arch,\r\nand a modern piscina and aumbrey in the wall.  The altar cloths are very\r\nhandsome, the upper cover being crimson plush, decorated with shields,\r\nand the cross and scales; the frontals are gifts of various persons, one\r\nof Algerian red silk and gold work in three compartments; a second of\r\nwhite silk, worked by Mrs. Clarke, late of Stainsby House, with the Agnus\r\nDei in the centre; the third is of green silk, with very rich embroidery;\r\nthe fourth, of plain purple velvet, with four bands of darker purple, for\r\nthe Lent season.\r\n\r\nThe churchyard cross has been recently restored after the fashion of the\r\nSomersby cross, a portion of the shaft being old.  There is also a modern\r\nsun dial, erected by the present Rector.  Fragments of the old tower, and\r\nof the Norman sandstone pillars, form ornaments in the Rectory garden.\r\n\r\nThe present Rectory was built in 1871, the architect being the late Mr.\r\nJames Fowler, of Louth, it has been added to since that date, and now\r\nforms a commodious residence in pretty grounds, and a picturesque\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nIt may be added, as an incident of special interest, that the father of\r\nthe late Sir John Franklin, the arctic explorer, on retiring from\r\nbusiness in Spilsby, bought a portion of ground in this parish, in south\r\nfield, and built a house, now occupied by Mr. W. R. Cartwright, in which\r\nhe resided for some years, and in which Sir John Franklin spent his\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, the Rector found in his garden a silver groat of Philip\r\nand Mary, two Nuremberg tokens, and a half-penny of William III.\r\n\r\nThe church and parish, in their past and present history, are among the\r\nmost interesting in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFULLETBY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFulletby lies about 3½ miles from Horncastle, in a north-east by north\r\ndirection, on the road to Belchford.  Letters, _via_ Horncastle, arrive\r\nat 10 a.m.  The nearest Money Order Office is at Belchford, the nearest\r\nTelegraph Office at Tetford, or Horncastle.  We do not know very much of\r\nthe ancient history of this parish.  In Domesday Book it is stated\r\n(“Lands of the Bishop of Durham”) that the Saxons, Siward and Edric, had\r\nthere two carucates (or about 240 acres) and six oxgangs of land,\r\nrateable to gelt.  William, a vassal of the Bishop {54} had also there\r\ntwo carucates (or 240 acres) and five villeins and 19 socmen, who had two\r\ncarucates and two oxgangs.  In Hearne’s “Liber Niger” (vol. ii) Ranulph,\r\nBishop of Durham, is said to have “in Fuletebi and Oxcum 4 carucates and\r\n6 oxgangs which Pinson holds” (Circa A.D. 1114).  Pinson was a Norman\r\nsoldier, Dapifer, or Steward of the Durham Bishops, and held many lands\r\nin this neighbourhood under them for the service of acting as their\r\nbailiff; the Bishop holding, “in chief,” direct from the sovereign.\r\nPinson thus became (deputy) Lord of Eresby, and other Episcopal\r\nLordships, and by the marriage of Walter de Beck, with Agnes, a daughter\r\nof Hugh Pinson, several of these lands passed to the family of Bec, or\r\nBek; one of the family, Anthony de Bec, himself became Bishop of Durham.\r\nIn 1214 the Bishop of Durham’s land in Fulletby and Oxcomb was held under\r\nhim by Henry Bec, and in the reign of Ed. I. John Beck and John de\r\nHarington held a Fee (doubtless the same property in Fulletby and\r\nOxcombe).  At another date, temp King Henry II., a certain “Count\r\nRichard,” probably the Earl of Chester, had “in Fulledebi 2 carucates.”\r\nBy the marriage of Sir William Willoughby with a daughter of Baron Bec,\r\nof Eresby, several of these Lordships passed to the Willoughby d’ Eresby\r\nfamily; and among them (“Testa de Nevill,” page 318) were lands in\r\n“ffotby”; and in Feet of Fines, Lincoln, (file 69, 31, Ed. I. A.D. 1303)\r\nit is stated that Robert de Wylgheby held “rent of 6 quarters of salt in\r\nffoletby, Beltefford, Golkesby, &c.”  While Gervase Holles says\r\n(“Collectanea,” Brit. Mus., vol. iii., p. 770) that in the reign of\r\nElizabeth, “Carolus, Dominus Willoughby de Parham,” was Lord of the Manor\r\nof Fulletby (“Old Lincolnshire,” vol. i., pp. 213–214).  The lands have\r\npassed from these old owners many years ago, and are now the property of\r\nthe Elmhirst, Booth, Riggall, and other families.\r\n\r\nIn the rebellion, called “the Lincolnshire Rising,” in 1536, Robert\r\nLeech, of Fulletby, joined with the insurgents, and, although his\r\nbrother, Nicholas Leech, parson of Belchford, escaped trial, Robert was\r\nput to death with Thomas Kendall, vicar of Louth, the Abbots (Matthew\r\nMackerell) of Barlings, and (Richard Harrison) of Kirkstead, and many\r\nothers.  Their names were included in a “List of Lincolnshire Martyrs,”\r\nsent to the Apostolic See, who were “first made Venerable, then Blessed,\r\nand lastly Canonised,” by his holiness, for their steadfastness in the\r\nPapal cause.  Other persons, known by name, connected with the parish as\r\npatrons of the benefice, have been the heirs of Nicholas Shepley in 1701;\r\nGeorge Lascells, Esq., in 1741; Thomas Rockliffe, Esq., in 1782; Francis\r\nRockliffe, clerk, in 1784; Mrs. A. R. Rockliffe, 1826; Rev. J. Jackson in\r\n1863.  F. Charsley, Esq., is the present patron; and Rev. R. Barker is\r\nrector, who has a substantial residence in the parish.  The benefice was\r\nformerly charged with a pension of 6s. 8d. to Bullington Priory.\r\n\r\nThe Church, St. Andrews, is a modern edifice, almost entirely rebuilt in\r\n1857 by Messrs Maughan and Fowler, of Louth; a previous larger church\r\nhaving been erected in 1705, on the site of a Saxon church, mentioned by\r\nArchdeacon Churton, in his “English Church,” as one of the two hundred\r\nand twenty-two churches in Lincolnshire existing before the Norman\r\nconquest.  No traces of the original Saxon church remain.  The fabric,\r\n400 years ago, is said to have been considerably longer, to have had a\r\ntower, and north and south aisles.  In the later fabric, the aisles had\r\ndisappeared, as shewn in an old print, and the tower which partly fell,\r\nin 1799, was then cut down to the level of the nave roof, with a small\r\nwooden bell-turret above it.\r\n\r\nThe Land Revenue Records (bundle 1392) state that there were “iij bells\r\nand a lytel bell.”  In 1566 the Churchwardens reported a “sacringe bell”\r\nas still remaining (Peacock’s “Church Furniture” p. 81.)  There are now\r\nonly two bells; and a tradition still lingers, that the largest of the\r\nformer bells now hangs in the belfry of Tetford church.  In 1834, the\r\nChurch, like several others in the neighbourhood, was thatched; at that\r\ndate the roof was repaired, and covered with tiles.\r\n\r\nThe east window is a good triplet, in early English style.  The present\r\npulpit was put up by the late Rector, the Rev. G. E. Frewer; and, along\r\nwith the Reredos, was carved by Mr. Winn, living in the parish.  The\r\nreading desk was carved by a former Rector, Rev. J. Jackson, but has of\r\nlate years, been altered.  There is a handsome brass lectern given by the\r\npresent Rector, Rev. R. Barker.  In the floor of the chancel is a slab,\r\nwith this inscription, “Depositum Ricardi Dugard qui obiit anno ætatis\r\n68, salutis 1653, Januarii 28.”  He is supposed to have been a nephew of\r\nWilliam Dugard, who printed the original edition of “Ikon Basilike,” in\r\nhis own house.  The two present bells are inscribed “Warner and Sons,\r\n1857.”  All the registers previous to 1750 have been lost.  Of the\r\ncommunion plate, the chalice and paten are dated 1688; the flagon is\r\nmodern.\r\n\r\nIn 1566 there was in the church “one alb, one cope, a crosse, super\r\naltaire, ij images, a mass, a piece of wood, whereon stood xxiv candels.”\r\nGeorge Monson, the royal commissioner, ordered that “they must awaie with\r\n(these) this side the first of Maie, and certifie.”\r\n\r\nIn 1846 six Roman urns, containing calcined bones, were dug up in this\r\nparish in an abandoned brickyard; and, about 5 years afterwards, another\r\nsimilar urn was found near the same place.  There are still found there a\r\nconsiderable quantity of fossils, ammonites, gryphæa, &c.; and the writer\r\nof these notes possesses a vertebra of a large saurian, one of several\r\nwhich have quite recently been found at the same place.\r\n\r\nFulletby School was rebuilt in 1849.  The 1st stone being laid in the\r\nlast week in August, to contain 60 children, by Dr. Spranger, Rector of\r\nLow Toynton, who gave handsomely, besides building at his own expense and\r\nendowing a School at New York.  The Rev. W. M. Pierce, Rector,\r\ncontributed, also Mrs. Elmhirst, of Yorkshire; the Lady of the Manor, the\r\nQueen Dowager giving £10.  (“Lincolnshire Chronicle,” August 28th, 1849).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOULCEBY.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoulceby lies in a northerly direction, about 7 miles from Horncastle,\r\nsome two miles further on than Scamblesby, and barely a mile west of\r\nAsterby, to which parish it is now ecclesiastically annexed; the joint\r\nvalue of the two benefices, the former a vicarage and the latter a\r\nrectory, being about £380 a year, now held by the Rev. J. Graham, J.P.,\r\nwho resides at Asterby.  Goulceby was probably, in Saxon times, the more\r\nimportant of the two places, since it was one of the 222 parishes in the\r\ncounty (according to Sir Henry Ellis) which possessed a church before the\r\nNorman Conquest, and one of the 131 which had a resident priest.\r\n\r\nLetters arrive _via_ Lincoln at 10 am., and are despatched at 3.55 p.m.\r\nThe nearest money order office is at Scamblesby, the nearest telegraph\r\noffice at Baumber; but, by arrangement, telegrams can be sent from the\r\nDonington-on-Bain station, on the Lincoln and Louth railway, which is\r\ndistant about 2 miles.\r\n\r\nThe village lies in a valley which is watered by a branch of the river\r\nBain.  The patronage of the benefice has been in various hands.  In\r\npre-reformation times it belonged to the Preceptory of the Knights\r\nTemplars at Willoughton; in 1605 it was held by Christopher Pickering\r\n(“Liber Regis”), later by a Mr. Hatley (Ecton’s “Thesaurus”); then by the\r\nListers of Burwell Park, who presented as late as 1837; from whom the\r\npatronage, with the manor, was acquired by the Bagnell family; whose\r\nrepresentative now presents to the united benefice, alternately with the\r\nTraffords, as Lords of the Manor of Asterby.  At what period the original\r\nchurch perished does not appear to be recorded; but, according to Weir\r\n(“History of Lincolnshire,” ed. 1828) there was in 1821 only a small\r\nmodern church, dedicated to all Saints.  This fell into decay, and in\r\n1855 was succeeded by a small brick and stone structure; which, in turn,\r\nhas more recently been taken down; and the church at Asterby now serves\r\nfor the two parishes.\r\n\r\nHistoric references to this parish are “few and far between,” yet by\r\nbringing them together, with a moderate degree of assumption from given\r\npremises, we can make out a fairly connected catena of its ownership.\r\nThe name itself can hardly be said to give a certain sound.  It has been\r\nvariously spelt, as Golsby, Goldesby, Gouthesby, Golksby, Colceby, and,\r\nin Domesday Book, Colchesbi.  We can only conjecture that it may have\r\nbeen the “Buy,” _i.e._, Byre, or farmstead of a Saxon Thane, named Col,\r\nKol, or Golk, the two former being common as contractions of Colswen, or\r\nColegrim, and not uncommon in the neighbourhood. {58}\r\n\r\nAccording to Domesday Book, this, like many other parishes in the\r\nneighbourhood, was among the possessions of the Norman noble, Ivo\r\nTaillebois, acquired through his marriage with the Lady Lucia, the\r\nwealthy Saxon heiress of the Thorolds, and connected with the Royal line\r\nof King Harold.  He (or she), had here 3 carucates of land (or 360\r\nacres), rateable to gelt; with 16 socmen and 2 villeins, occupying 6\r\ncarucates (or 720 acres); a mill worth 4s. yearly; a church and priest,\r\nand 120 acres of meadow.  As I mention in notices of other parishes\r\n(Bolingbroke, Scamblesby &c.), the tenure of these demesnes was not of\r\nlong duration, and in a few years they were dispersed among the\r\ndescendants of the Saxon heiress.  Goulceby would seem to have become an\r\nappurtenance, with Belchford, Donington and several others, of the\r\nsuperior manor of Burwell.  It would thus be granted, originally, by\r\nHenry I. to the Norman family of De la Haye, one of whom, in the 13th\r\ncentury, founded the Benedictine Alien Priory of Burwell, as a dependency\r\nof the Abbey of S. Mary Silvæ Majoris, near Bourdeaux, and endowed it\r\nwith some of his own demesnes.  This family held these possessions for\r\n150 years.  The last of them, John De la Haye, in the reign of Edward I.,\r\nhaving enfeoffed Philip de Kyme of the same, continued for the remainder\r\nof his life to hold the lands, under the said Philip, by the peculiar\r\n(nominal) “service of _one rose_.”  (Chancery Inquis., post mortem, 21,\r\nEdward I., No. 33).  For some years the Kymes held the property, being\r\ncalled to Parliament as Barons, and doing other service for their\r\nsovereigns; until in 12 Edward III. (Dugdale’s “Baronage,” i., 621)\r\nWilliam of that name died without issue; and his widow married as her\r\nsecond husband, Nicholas de Cantelupe (whose ancestors had been Earls of\r\nAbergavenny), who thus succeeded to these demesnes.  He dying also\r\nwithout issue, on the subsequent death of his widow, the property\r\nreverted to Gilbert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus, who had been enfeoffed\r\nof it by his uncle, the above William.  Gilbert, again, died without\r\nissue, and his widow married Henry Percy, created at the coronation of\r\nRichard II., the 1st Earl of Northumberland, who thus in turn acquired\r\nthe property.  He, however, rebelled against Henry IV. (Camden’s\r\n“Britannia,” p. 547); and on his attainder that sovereign granted the\r\nmanors to his son John, afterward.  Duke of Bedford (Patent Rolls, 6, H.\r\niv., p. 2., m. 16s)  He dying without issue, the property reverted to the\r\ncrown, and Henry VI. granted it to Ralph, Lord Treasurer Cromwell.\r\n(Patent Roll 18, H. vi., pt. 2, m. 19).\r\n\r\nBefore this period, however, the Cromwells were connected with Goulceby,\r\nsince it is shewn, by an Inquisition in the reign of Henry V. (post\r\nmortem, No. 72, A.D. 1419), that Matilda, the wife of Sir Ralph Cromwell,\r\nKnight, held lands in Roughton, Wodehall, Langton, Golseby, Belcheford,\r\nDonington, etc., {59} and that Sir Ralph Cromwell her son was the next\r\nheir.  When the Lord Treasurer founded at Tattershall, the College of the\r\nHoly Trinity, on the 17th Henry VI. (1439), he endowed it with portions\r\nof many of these manors, as had also been done in the case of Burwell\r\nPriory, centuries before; Goulceby doubtless being one of them.  On the\r\ndissolution of Religious Houses by Henry VIII. a great number of the\r\nlands connected with them in this neighbourhood were bestowed by that\r\nsovereign on Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, among these being\r\nGoulceby, Belchford, ffulletsbye, etc. {60a}  He died 24 August, 1545,\r\nleaving two sons, Henry and Charles, by his wife Catherine, daughter and\r\nheiress of William Lord Willoughby de Eresby.  They, while at St. John’s\r\nCollege, Cambridge, died of the epidemic, called “the sweating sickness,”\r\n16 July, 1551 (Cooper’s “Athenæ Cantabridgenses,” i., 105); whereupon the\r\ndescendants of the daughters of their great grandfather, Sir William\r\nBrandon, were declared the rightful heirs.  One of these, Eleanor, had\r\nmarried John Glemham, of Glemham Parva, Suffolk, and their great grandson\r\nsucceeded Thomas Glemham, Burwell, and a considerable portion of these\r\ndemesnes. {60b}  He died about the 14 year of Queen Elizabeth, and was\r\nsucceeded by his son Henry, afterwards Sir Henry Glemham, Knight, who\r\nmarried Lady Anne Sackville, daughter of the Earl of Dorset. {60c}  He\r\nsettled upon his wife, Burwell, with appurtenances; and documents\r\nconnected with the Lister family (subsequently owners of Burwell, etc.),\r\nnow in the possession of Porter Wilson, Esq., shew that, in 1602, the\r\nfarm rents included those from “Goulsby, Belchforde, Donington super\r\nbayne,” etc.  We now proceed a step further to another change of\r\nownership:—In 1641, Sir Thomas Glemham, of Burwell, was a strong\r\nsupporter of Charles I., being Colonel of the King’s 4th Regiment, and\r\nsuccessively, Governor of York, Carlisle, and Oxford. {60d}  He, probably\r\nin order to raise funds for his royal master, sold for £15,000, the\r\nBurwell estate and its many appurtenances, to Sir Matthew Lister, Knight,\r\nof St. Martin in the Fields, co. Middlesex, and Martin Lister, of Thorpe\r\nArnold, co. Leicester, his brother.  It is somewhat curious that in the\r\nlist of manors, which then changed hands, although Belchford, Oxcombe,\r\nffaireforth (_i.e._ Farforth), and Walmesgate, all in the near\r\nneighbourhood of Goulceby, are named, no mention is made of Goulceby\r\nitself, yet down to as recently as 1863 the patronage of the benefice was\r\nvested in them (Morris’s “Gazetteer,” 1863).  It appears, however, from a\r\ndeed of settlement, dated 10 Jan. 1656–7 (or about 15 years after the\r\nsale), that Sir Martin Lister, of Thorpe Arnold, was possessed of\r\nBelchford, Colceby, &c.; and after his death, his children were to divide\r\nhis property, and the trustees were “empowered to sell, if necessary,\r\nBelchford, Colceby,” &c.  It is possible that by this “Colceby,” Calceby\r\nmay be intended, which was annexed to Driby and Ormsby; but it certainly\r\nlooks as if Goulceby formed a part of the share of the property\r\noriginally bought by Sir Matthew Lister’s brother Martin.  The Listers\r\ncontinued to be owners of Burwell, doubtless at different periods parting\r\nwith various of the subsidiary “appurtenances” down to a few years ago;\r\nintermarrying with the Dymokes, Alingtons, Gregorys of Harlaxton, Lord\r\nDeloraine, members of the families of Sir Robt. Barkham, Knollys, Sir\r\nEdward Boughton, and forming other good connections.  Only in 1883, was\r\nthe property finally parted with by the late Matthew Henry Lister, eldest\r\nson of Matthew Bancroft Lister, High Sheriff in 1800, to the present\r\nowner, William Hornsby, Esq., High Sheriff in 1898.  We may add that\r\nMatthew Bancroft Lister claimed descent from Philip of Kyme; whose\r\nfamily, we have seen, were owners of Goulceby, in the reign of Edward I.,\r\nand in 1840 he petitioned the Queen for a revival in his person of the\r\nBarony of Kyme; but that dignity still remains in abeyance.  Of the\r\nMatthew Lister who married Eleanor, daughter of the Hon. Sir Charles\r\nDymoke, Knight, champion of James II. (Circa 1683), it is recorded that\r\nhe had a son “Martin, baptized 1 October, buried in woollen 30 Nov.,\r\n1693.” {61}  For these particulars as to the ownership of Goulceby in the\r\npast, I am largely indebted to a paper in the “Architectural Society’s\r\nJournal” for 1897, by Mr. R. W. Goulding, entitled “Notes on the Lords of\r\nthe Manor of Burwell.”\r\n\r\nThe present owners of Goulceby are Colonel Bagnell, Lord of the Manor,\r\nEarl Manvers, Thomas Falkner Alison, and various small proprietors.\r\n\r\nThe following particulars of the Listers are worthy of mention.—Sir\r\nMatthew Lister, M.D., was fellow of Oriel College, Oxford; Physician to\r\nQueen Anne, Consort of James I.; and Physician in Ordinary to Charles I.,\r\nby whom he was knighted in 1636 (Woods’ “Fasti Oxon.,” 3rd ed., 1815, i.,\r\n307–8), he died at the age of 92.  The entry of his burial is as follows,\r\n“Matthew Lyster, Kt. & cheefe lord of Burwell, &c., was buried December\r\nthe 19th, 1657.”  Among the bequests in his will, dated 18th August,\r\n1656, are the following:—To his wife all his household stuff . . ., all\r\n“the jewells she usually weareth, and hath in her custodie”; also his\r\n“coach and coach-horses, if he should have any at his death.”  “Item, I\r\ngive to be divided between her and my neece, Sir Martin Lister’s wife,\r\nall that poure remnant of Plate which is left me since these troubles.”\r\nTo his “son in law George Banfield, and to his sister, the Ladie Cobham,\r\n£10 for a remembrance.”  To his “servant John Mitchele, £50 . . ., and if\r\nhe bee with me at my death all my wearing apparel, except one _fringed\r\nsattin gown lyned with furre called ffitches_ (_i.e._, Marten skins),\r\nwhich I desire my wife may have.”  We may assume that this was some\r\nofficial, or court, robe worn by Sir Matthew on occasions of ceremony.\r\nHe was President of the London College of Physicians, and even in our own\r\nday, members of a College wear the “gowns” of their degree or office.\r\n\r\nAnother member of the family, Martin Lister, M.D., F.R.S., was one of\r\nQueen Anne’s Physicians, an eminent zoologist, and author of books on\r\nvarious branches of Natural History.  His most important work was his\r\n“Historia sive, synopsis Methodica Conchyliorum.”  Various plants and\r\nanimals have been named after him.\r\n\r\nTwo or three other documents connected with Goulceby, may be here briefly\r\nreferred to:—\r\n\r\nBy a Final Concord, dated 20 June, 1202, an agreement was made between\r\nHolda, daughter of Geoffrey, on the one hand, and certain Monks of\r\nMinting Priory, who were tenants of an oxgang of land in Goutheby, by\r\nwhich she surrendered all claim to the land, in favour of the Monks and\r\ntheir successors for ever.  In return for which the Monks gave her one\r\nmark.\r\n\r\nOn July 28, 1231, an agreement was made between the Master of the Knights\r\nTemplars in England, and William Moysaunt and Amice his wife, by which\r\nthe said William and Amice acknowledged a certain meadow in Golkesby to\r\nbe the right of the said Master “to have and to hold, to him and his\r\nsuccessors, in free, pure, and perpetual alms”; and for this the said\r\nMaster gave them 2s.\r\n\r\nBy will, dated 30 May, 1617, Adam Henneage of Donynton Super Bane, Gent,\r\nleft to Frances his wife “all my messuage in Goulcebie, wherein John\r\nClarke now dwelleth”; and to his “sonne James his copyhold land in\r\nGoulcebie, in tenure of Peter Pindar and John Tomson.”  Proved at\r\nHorncastle, 28 June, 1617.  By will, dated 23 July, 1623, Thomas Kent, of\r\nScamblesby, Clerk, left “to the poor people of the parish of Goulceby,\r\n20s.,” with similar bequests to the poor of Donington and Scamblesby.\r\nProved at Lincoln, 15 Nov., 1623.\r\n\r\nThe will of Timothy Kent, of Donington, Clerk, dated 13 Feb., 1623–4,\r\nmentions lands in Goulceby and Asterby, and leaves bequests to various\r\nrelations and servants, and to the Cathedral Church, Lincoln, 2s., and to\r\nthe poor of Donington, 20s.  Proved at Lincoln, 28 May, 1624.  Elias\r\nKent, of Scamblesby, Gent., by will, dated 13 Feb., 1625, leaves various\r\nbequests to relatives and friends, and “to the poorest people of Goulceby\r\n10s., to those of Donington 10s., to those Scamblesby 40s.”  Proved at\r\nLincoln, 20 Dec., 1628.  (“Lincs. N. & Q.,” Vol. III., pp. 205–207).\r\n\r\nThe poor of Goulceby have an annual rent charge of £2 10s., left by\r\nAnthony Acham, which is distributed in bread.  He also in 1638 founded,\r\nand endowed with £10 yearly, a school here; which was re-built in 1865,\r\nwith accommodation for 130 children; the original endowment is now\r\nsupplemented from other sources, and the school serves for the parishes\r\nof Goulceby, Asterby, and Stenigot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREETHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreetham is distant about 3½ miles from Horncastle, in an easterly\r\ndirection, lying just beyond the parish of High Toynton, south of\r\nFulletby, west of Ashby Puerorum and north of Winceby.  The village is\r\nchiefly situated on a cross-road running north and south (and probably\r\nRoman) which unites the road from Horncastle to Tetford with that from\r\nHorncastle to Hagworthingham and Spilsby.  The nearest money order and\r\ntelegraph office is at Horncastle, whence the letters arrive at 9.20.\r\na.m.  The population of this village is now just over 130; but, as Isaac\r\nTaylor says (“Words and Places,” p. 1), “local names are records of the\r\npast,” and Greetham, as its name implies, was at one time a place of\r\nconsiderably more importance than at present.  The Saxons named it\r\nGreetham, or the great village; which, as Mr. Streatfeild suggests\r\n(“Lincolnshire and the Danes,” p. 18), the Normans translated into\r\n“Grandham,” or “Granham,” as we find it in the Conqueror’s survey in\r\nDomesday Book; and which was sometimes further curtailed into “Graham,”\r\nas we find a field in High Toynton described as the “24 acres towards\r\nGraham.”  (Feet of Fines, Lincoln, 9, Henry III., No. 52, A.D. 1224–25,\r\nquoted “Linc. N. & Q,” vol. iii., pp. 245–6).  And not only was Greetham\r\n(or Grandham) held in demesne, _i.e._, as a manor, but, like the\r\nneighbouring Bolingbroke, being connected with Royalty, it became also\r\ndesignated an “Honour.”\r\n\r\nIn a Chancery Inquisition post mortem (21 Henry VII., No. 122) taken\r\nafter the death of Henry Dawson, it is stated that “4 messuages, &c., in\r\nTetney are held of the Lord the King, as of his Honour of Bullingbroke”;\r\nand in almost similar terms, in a Chancery Inquisition post mortem, of\r\nthe same King, No. 124, taken after the death of William Quadring, Esq.,\r\nit is stated that he “held a messuage in Irby, of the Lord the King, as\r\nof his Manor of Greetham, parcel of his Duchy of Lancaster.”  In Domesday\r\nBook it is stated that certain lands in the Manor of Bilsby, near Alford,\r\nare “held of the Manor of Grandham”; Greetham apparently not in either of\r\nthese cases being regarded as an Honour.  But in an Inquisition post\r\nmortem, of John Asfordby, A.D. 1499, it is stated that the manor of this\r\nsame Bilsby, with Westhalgarth, is “held of the Lord the King, as of the\r\nHonour of Greetham.”  But, even as early as Domesday (1080), lands are\r\nenumerated as belonging to “Grandham,” lying in Langtune (by Spilsby),\r\nHacberdineham (Hagworthingham), Salmundby, Tedforde, Brinkhill, Wingsby,\r\nand Clachesby Pluckacre, in all amounting to 33 carucates, or close upon\r\n4,000 acres (3960).  And, to shew the wealth of the manor at that date,\r\ncompared with some others in the neighbourhood, while Scrivelsby is given\r\nin Domesday as of the value of £14, and Horncastle at £44, Bolingbroke is\r\nput at £40, but Greetham at £60, and it is further tallaged, _i.e._,\r\ntaxed at £70.  It was the “caput Honoris,” or head, of the Lincolnshire\r\nBarony of Hugh de Abrincis, or Avranches, the Conqueror’s nephew,\r\nsurnamed Lupus, or The Wolf, from his many deeds of violence.  He was\r\nEarl of Chester, having the whole of Cheshire assigned to him, except a\r\nsmall portion belonging to the Bishop; and his royal uncle further\r\ngranted to him, nine manors in Berkshire, seven in Yorkshire, ten in\r\nDorset, thirty-two in Suffolk, and twelve in Norfolk, twenty-two in\r\nLeicester, and about a score in Lincolnshire, besides smaller numbers in\r\nother counties, and sokes and berewicks beyond counting.  Earl Lupus in\r\nhis later years, attempted to atone for the irregularities of his early\r\nlife, by becoming monk in his own Abbey of St. Werburg, at Chester.\r\nLater, the estates which he held, reverted to the crown, and were, in\r\npart, granted to the Earl of Lincoln, who was created Duke of Lancaster.\r\nHis daughter and heiress, married the 4th son of King Edwd. III., who\r\nalso, through his wife, became Duke of Lancaster, and was father of Henry\r\nof Bolinbroke, afterwards Henry IV.  After various vicissitudes, the\r\nHonour and much of the very extensive soke of Bolingbroke, became merged\r\nin the Crown; and, in part, still remains the property of the Sovereign,\r\nthe King having among his titles still the Palatine Dukedom of Lancaster.\r\nThe fortunes of Greetham were more varied.  It is impossible, from the\r\nsources of information available for these notes to give all the\r\nsuccessive steps in the tenure of this manor, and of its numerous and\r\nvaluable appurtenances; or to give the connection, if any, between\r\nsuccessive owners.  Fixity of tenure was by no means a feature of those\r\ntimes, the power of the Sovereign was almost absolute, and demesnes were\r\nseized by him, forfeited, retained, granted anew, or disposed of for\r\nmoney, according to the royal caprice, or the exigencies of his purse, in\r\na most arbitrary fashion.  To show the precarious nature of tenures held\r\n“in capite,” or “in chief” from the Sovereign, we will mention one or two\r\ncases, taken haphazard:—Edmund of Woodstock, 2nd son of Edwd. I., was\r\nbeheaded by Edward III., in the 4th year of his reign.  He had been\r\ngranted the manor of Greetham only 3 years before (Dugdale’s “Baronage,”\r\nvol. ii., p. 93).  At a previous period, Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln,\r\ndied seised of the manor of Greetham.  In the ordinary course of events,\r\nthe manor would have remained a possession of his daughter, Alice,\r\ncountess of Lincoln.  Yet a Lancaster Record (class xxv. R. 8), shows\r\nthat Alice granted the manor to Hugh Dispenser, 16 Ed. II., and, he being\r\na favourite of that King, we can hardly doubt that the grant was a forced\r\none.  The historian Speed informs us that, the Earl of Lancaster being\r\nattainted, the elder Dispenser obtained a grant of some of the Lancaster\r\nproperty in Lincolnshire.  But in 1327, the younger Dispenser, the Hugh\r\nabove-named, the favourite of the King (Edward II.), fell into disfavour,\r\nand a commission was appointed to enquire what goods and chattels he\r\npossessed at the time of his banishment, in his manors of Greetham,\r\nThorley, Wainfleet and Brattleby.  He also held at that time, as shown by\r\nother records, lands in Thornton, Roughton, Wilksby, Wood Enderby,\r\nPartney, Mareham-le-Fen, &c., and a manor in Scrivelsby.  But he, in his\r\nturn being banished, the attainder of the Earl of Lancaster was revoked,\r\nand the property once more reverted to the Lancaster family, in the\r\nperson of his brother and successor, Henry of Lancaster.\r\n\r\nTruly the history of many a noble family of those times was a moving and\r\nvivid commentary on the words of Holy Writ, “Put not your confidence in\r\nPrinces!”\r\n\r\nIn a list of military tenures (temp. Henry II.), while Norman d’Arcy, the\r\nEarl of Britanny, Alan de Percy, Stephen of Albemarle, and several\r\nothers, are named as holding various of the manors in the neighbourhood,\r\nthe Duke of Lancaster is given as “Lord” of Greetham, Winceby and\r\nHameringham (“Old Lincolnshire,” by G. H. Burton, 1885, vol. i. pp.\r\n214–215).  These, as we have seen, had been very extensively added to,\r\nand further additions are named in various records, some of which we will\r\nhere give, as they show the importance of Greetham.  We should, however,\r\nobserve that because a great Baron held the manor of a demesne, it did\r\nnot at all follow that he owned the whole parish.  This applies to\r\nGreetham, as follows:—In an Assize Roll, at Lincoln, of 9 Edward I. (A.D.\r\n1280), a certain Robert de Kyrketon, and his wife Beatrix, demand (and\r\ntheir claim is admitted), certain rents of lands in “Askeby next Gretham\r\n(_i.e._, Ashby Puerorum), Stavenesby (_i.e._, Stainsby), Bag-endreby and\r\nLittle Gretham,” at a time when the Earl of Lancaster was lord of the\r\nmanor.  An Inquisition of the Earls of Kent (2nd son of Edwd. I.,\r\nbeheaded. 4 Edward III. and at that time, as we have already stated,\r\nholding the manor of Greetham), shows that lands in Huttoft,\r\nTheddlethorpe, Wainfleet and Thoresby, as well as in Bratoft and\r\nMablethorpe (the two latter also given in Domesday), were held under the\r\nmanor of Greetham in addition to those already named in the more\r\nimmediate neighbourhood, of Bratoft and Mablethorpe, appurtenances of\r\nGreetham at the time of Domesday (1080) and continued to be so as late as\r\n1552 (“Linc. N. & Q.” vol. iv. p. 122).\r\n\r\nWe will now look at the evidence of Greetham being an “Honour” as well as\r\na manor.  The two properties of Bolingbroke and Greetham, eventually,\r\nafter various changes, passed under the same ownership; both forming\r\nparts of the Duchy of Lancaster.  The Honour of Bolingbroke, was also\r\ncalled the Honour of Richmond, from the Earl and Countess of that name,\r\nthe parents of the future Henry IV. of England, the only Sovereign of\r\nEngland born in Lincolnshire.  The manor of Greetham is sometimes called\r\nthe “Honour of Lancaster,” _par excellence_, but it is quite clear that\r\nGreetham is then intended, and though united, even under one common\r\nmanagement, they were legally regarded and treated as distinct “Honours.”\r\nIn a bailiff’s account of Rents of Assize, and of Court Perquisites (now\r\nin the possession of John Sykes, Esq., F.S.A., of Doncaster, quoted\r\n“Linc. N. & Q.” iii. p. 82), it is specified, that beside the Bolingbroke\r\nRents, there “is nothing, because the others are given in the accounts of\r\nthe Honour of Lancaster,” _i.e._ of Greetham; and the same distinction is\r\nobserved in the “Perquisites of Courts,” where we find, “13s. 6d. from\r\ntwo views and Courts of the Honour of Bolingbroke, and one view and Court\r\nof Honour of Lancaster” (Greetham).  Although the two accounts were thus\r\nkept distinct, the Court Rolls of the year (10 Richard II), show that the\r\nCourt of both Honours were at that time “holden together by order of\r\nThomas Hungerforde, Knight, Chief Steward.”  In the earlier of these\r\nRecords, Greetham was necessarily described merely as a manor, because it\r\nwas not yet connected with royalty, and therefore was not then an Honour.\r\nBut in later documents it is frequently referred to as such; for\r\ninstance, in a Chancery Inquisition post mortem taken at Alford, 22 July\r\nA.D. 1506 (21 Henry VII. No. 121), we find it stated that “Thomas Rygge\r\nGentylman, held certain lands, with their appurtenances, in Westyrkele\r\nand Langton, of the lord the King, of his Honour of Greteham” (“Journal\r\nof Architect. Society,” 1895, pp. 42–3).  It is further stated that “John\r\nAfforby held the manor of Bilsby, of the Lord the King, as of the Honor\r\nof Gretham, of his Duchy of Lancaster” (quoted “Lincs. N. & Q.” iv. p.\r\n108).\r\n\r\nBesides the places already named as belonging to the demesne, or soke, of\r\nGreetham, I find “Lecheburne” (_i.e._ Legbourne), Swaby, Elgelo (_i.e._,\r\nBelleau), Claythorpe, Totele (_i.e._, Tothill), Withern, Haugh, Calceby,\r\nDalby, Dexthorpe, and many more.\r\n\r\nEnough has, however, been said to shew the extent of the soke, or\r\njurisdiction, of the lords of Greetham, and its rank as an “Honour”\r\nconnected at different periods with royalty.\r\n\r\nIts subsequent history, down to the present century, is almost a blank.\r\nThe Manor, although still, in our Directories (see Weir, Kelly, etc.),\r\nstyled “a parcel of the Duchy of Lancaster,” has dwindled much in\r\nimportance; and the inhabitants are apparently becoming fewer.  In 1821\r\nthey numbered 148, in 1843 they were 152, in 1883 they were 147, in 1891\r\nthey had dropped to 131.  The total acreage is 1250.  A few stray\r\nnotices, connected with by-gone Greetham, are the following:—In Gibbon’s\r\n“Early Lincoln Wills” (p. 67), Richard de Ravenser, Archdeacon of\r\nLincoln, by Will, dated “15 May, 1385,” bequeaths a legacy to Walter de\r\nGretham.  Who the latter was, we have no means of learning.  The\r\nRavensers were of a good family.  In Maddison’s “Wills of Lincolnshire”\r\n(1500–1600), p. 26, No. 68, we find that Richard Newcomen, of Nether\r\nToynton, by will, dated “3 Sep., 1540, left xx pence to the poor of\r\nGreetham.”  The Newcomens were among our oldest families, originally\r\nseated at Saltfleetby, where their names appear in the registers, for\r\nmany generations.  One of them, John Newcomen, “of Sallaby,” was involved\r\nin the Lincolnshire Rebellion of 1536, along with Monsons, Massingberds,\r\nHeneages, Maddisons, and many other members of leading families.  This\r\nRichard, above-named, settled at Low Toynton early in the 16th century,\r\nand his grandson Samuel, “of Nether Toynton,” married Frances, daughter\r\nof Thomas Massingberd, of Bratoft Hall, Esq., M.P.  Several of them are\r\nmentioned in the Herald’s “Lists of Gentry” in 1634 and 1666, as residing\r\nat Hagnaby, Withern, Bag Enderby, &c.  They have now disappeared from\r\nSaltfleetby and “their place knoweth them no more.”  Their pedigree is\r\ngiven in the “Architectural Society’s Journal” for 1897.  Another old\r\nrecord (from the same source) is “John Dighton of Minting, by Will dated\r\n17 December, 1606, leaves to Thomas Page of Greetham vj £.”  Who Thomas\r\nPage was is unknown; but the Dightons were a well known family, of\r\nmercantile origin at Lincoln; the founder having served as Mayor and\r\nSheriff; one of them, Thomas resided at Waddingworth, another at Minting;\r\nthe chief member, Robert, owned and occupied the Hall at Stourton Magna,\r\nof which traces still remain in mounds and moats.  He also was involved\r\nin the Lincolnshire rebellion.  A daughter of Dighton of Stourton married\r\nEdward Clinton, Esq., of Baumber, who afterwards became Earl of Lincoln,\r\nand his descendants Dukes of Newcastle, whose burial place, for some\r\ngenerations, was at Baumber.  “The fashion of the world changeth” the\r\nDightons are gone, the Clintons, renovated in blood, remain.\r\n\r\nA tradition remains to this day, that Thomas Wentworth, Earl of\r\nStratford, in the reign of Charles I., and one of his Sovereign’s most\r\nfaithful adherents, owned the manor of Greetham.  I cannot find any\r\npositive proof of this; but it seems not at all unlikely, since a lease\r\ndated 14 Nov., 1685, was granted to Sir William Wentworth, Knight, of\r\nAshby Puerorum, who was a son of Sir William Wentworth, who fell at\r\nMarston Moor, fighting for Charles I; and from him descended the first\r\nEarl of Stafford, of the second creation. {69}  It is proved by the award\r\nthat Thomas, Earl of Stafford was Lord of the Manor in 1785.\r\n\r\nWe pass on to the present century.  About the year 1830, John Fardell,\r\nEsq., of Lincoln (who represented that City in Parliament for a brief\r\nperiod, being unseated on petition) became owner, by purchase, of the\r\nManor of Greetham, the rest of the parish, except the Rectory farm of 48\r\nacres, being purchased by the late Mr. Robert Dennis, who built in 1830,\r\na commodious residence, Greetham House, where his two daughters now\r\nreside.  The manor, and about half the parish, was sold by the Fardell\r\nTrustees to F. Wormall, Esq., whose present representative is his\r\ngrand-daughter, Lady Garden of Templemore Abbey, co. Tipperary; whose\r\nfather was Colonel Valentine Baker, one of a family distinguished as\r\nsportsmen, travellers, and soldiers.  We have said that the road, or\r\nstreet, on which the village houses cluster, was probably originally\r\nRoman; and some years ago, the neck of a Roman urn was found near it.\r\nAlong this road, to the North is a quarry in which many ammonites and\r\nother fossils are found, in the gravel lying above the white clay.  The\r\nage of “Praise God Barebones” and his Puritanical allies, has long since\r\npassed away; but something of the Puritan Spirit seems to survive in the\r\nnames of the villagers, given in the registers, which date from 1653.  My\r\ninformant had herself known, within recent years, the names Mordecai,\r\nNaomi, Keziah, Solomon, and Bridget shortened into Briggy.  There are\r\nalso some curious field names.  A boggy field is called the “Waddles”; a\r\nsimilar field in the almost adjoining parish of Salmonby is called\r\n“Wallows,” both probably referring to a slough of mire, and the awkward\r\nducklike gait involved in traversing it.  A grass field is named\r\n“Thunker,” as locally pronounced, which may embody the Norse Thing-garth,\r\nor Council enclosure of the great hamlet.  Another meadow is named\r\n“Kirtle,” probably the Kirk-dale; while two fields, one ploughed and the\r\nother meadow, are called “the Gousles,” which Mr. Streatfeild\r\n(“Lincolnshire and the Danes,” p. 174.) considers to mean the first\r\nslopes of the Wolds.  “Gaut,” or “gout” (go-out) means an outlet from a\r\ndrain; and throughout the whole range of the Wolds, there are numerous\r\nsprings, issuing from their base, not uncommonly possessing medicinal\r\nproperties.  Greetham is situated on the first spur or projection, of the\r\nWolds in this locality, and these gousles may have been the goutsleys, or\r\nmeadows, in which were the sources of local springs.\r\n\r\nN.B.—In East Kirkby, at the foot of the Wolds, is a field named\r\nGoutscroft.\r\n\r\nThere is also a field, named “Cross Close,” from which the poor receive a\r\nyearly dole of 10s., bequeathed by Elizabeth Somersby, in 1733.  Here is\r\na name which would seem to embody ancient history.  We can picture to\r\nourselves, the Saxon “rude forefathers of the (great) hamlet,” gathered\r\nround that sacred symbol, the village cross, before a church existed, to\r\nlisten to the itinerant man of God, awakening in their hearts a simple\r\nfaith in a welcome Saviour.  These fields all, or most, of them lie in\r\nthe western part of the parish, the property of the Misses Dennis.\r\n\r\nOf the Church, dedicated to All Saints, little can be said.  It is a poor\r\nfabric, of Spilsby sandstone, with square wood-framed windows, one in\r\neach side and end.  A “three-decker” pulpit, reading desk, and clerk’s\r\nseat, square pews, a west singing gallery, a very meagre rood screen of\r\napparently modern poor carving, all painted wainscot colour.  The roof a\r\nflat, white-washed ceiling inside, is covered externally over the nave\r\nwith lead, which, from the decay of the supporting timbers is now almost\r\nflat, and probably not in a very safe condition.  The chancel roof is\r\nslated and pointed.  The font is plain octagonal, with octagonal shaft,\r\nand square basin, within the bowl being a pewter christening basin, with\r\ndate “1821.”  The single bell hangs in a shabby bell turret, surmounted\r\nby a cross.  A slab records the death of a former Rector, the Rev. Thomas\r\nJesset, in 1837.  The inscriptions on the grave-stones in the churchyard\r\nwould imply that the inhabitants are long-lived, and the place healthy,\r\nas it should be, from its elevated and well-drained position.  The Rector\r\nhas a good residence, built in 1852.\r\n\r\nADDENDUM.—The above remarks on the Church were written in the year 1900.\r\nWe have much pleasure in adding, in the year 1903, that the present\r\nRector, the Rev. T. Hoole, has succeeded in effecting a thorough\r\nrestoration of the old fabric, at a cost of about £1,650, towards which\r\nsum, the Misses Dennis, of Greetham House, contributed £500 each.  The\r\nArchitect was Mr. Hodgson Fowler, of Durham; the contractors for the work\r\nwere Messrs. Bowman & Co., of Stamford.  The only features of interest in\r\nthe former mean structure were a 13th century cross, and doorway, and the\r\nsouth respond of the chancel arch.  The restored fabric has been\r\nconstructed in harmony with this respond.  It is throughout of a simple,\r\nbut effective, late 15th century design.  The chancel, vestry,\r\nbell-turret, and porch are new, and the screen has been restored; the\r\nnave has new windows, a well-repaired roof, and new flooring, all the\r\ninternal fittings being of oak.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the work, other features of interest were discovered,\r\nnamely, the responds of a south aisle, a north door, and a Norman\r\nentrance into a former tower.  All these were effectively utilised by the\r\narchitect, with his accustomed skill, and now the Church, though small,\r\nis large enough for the parish, and a worthy edifice for divine worship,\r\na result which must be gratifying to all concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAGWORTHINGHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nHagworthingham is a considerable village, at a distance of 6 miles east\r\nof Horncastle, and 4½ north-west of Spilsby, on the road from Horncastle,\r\n_via_ High Toynton and Greetham, to Partney.  Letters _via_ Spilsby,\r\narrive about 9 a.m.  It has its own Post Office, Money Order Office, and\r\nSavings Bank; the nearest telegraph office being at Spilsby.  Of this\r\nparish there are several notices in Domesday Book.  It is described as\r\ncomprising six manors.  These were owned, at the date of the Norman\r\nConquest, by Thanes named Sivert, Elric, Swen, Swave, Holinchetel, and\r\nAdestan.  The Conqueror apparently removed all these original\r\nproprietors, to provide for his own followers.  Few places shew to a\r\ngreater degree than this parish the insecurity of tenure which marked\r\nthose times of trouble, transition, and lawlessness, when might was\r\nright.  The survey of the country, made by order of the Conqueror, in\r\nLincolnshire in 1085, was called by the Saxons “Domesday Book,” because\r\nit recorded their “doom,” or their almost universal expropriation from\r\ntheir rights, in favour of the Normans, who flocked into the country with\r\nWilliam.  But the “doom” was not confined to the Saxon.  The Norman\r\nintruder, in many cases, found his possessions even less secure than had\r\nbeen that of those whom he superseded, and the Norman Lords of these\r\ndemesnes succeeded each other with such rapidity, that, at this distance\r\nof time, it is beyond our power to trace their connection, in every case,\r\nwith each other, or the causes of the changes.  Doubtless, in many\r\ninstances, having acquired possession through violence to others,\r\nviolence again led to the confiscation of what they had acquired.  The\r\nfirst-named of these is Alan, Earl of Britanny, on whom the Conqueror had\r\nconferred his daughter Constance in marriage.  Famed for his valour and\r\nmartial spirit, he had held an important command at the Battle of\r\nHastings; and for his services the Conqueror conferred upon him, firstly,\r\nall the lands in the North Riding of Yorkshire, forming the district\r\ncalled Richmondshire, which had belonged to the powerful Saxon Earl\r\nEdwin, who was now dispossessed.  From this gift he derived the title of\r\nEarl of Richmond, as well as of Britanny.  Dugdale tells us that,\r\naltogether he held, by grant from the Conqueror, 450 Manors, 101 of these\r\nbeing in Lincolnshire.  He seems however, in himself, to have been not\r\nunworthy of so great a position; since, though so great a warrior, the\r\nChronicler, Ordericus Vitalis, states, that he was “ever studious for\r\npeace, a great lover of the poor, an especial honourer of the religious”;\r\nand that “his death, without issue created no little sorrow to all good\r\npeople.”  Such was one of the first Norman Lords of Hagworthingham.  He\r\nwas succeeded by his brother, also named Alan.  His chief residence,\r\nprobably, being in Yorkshire, when not in attendance on the King, he was\r\nrepresented at Hagworthingham, by his vassal, Eudo, who occupied his land\r\nhere, to the extent of 3 carucates (or 360 acres), with dependents, in\r\nwhose hands were 5 carucates (or 600 acres) more.  Before proceeding to\r\nspeak of other Norman Lords connected with this place, let us notice the\r\nname itself of the parish.  It has 3 elements: “Haugh,” (says\r\nStreatfeild, “Lincolnshire and the Danes”), “is low, meadow land,\r\nbordering on a stream, and frequently overflowed”; a kindred form, “Hagi”\r\nhe says also means a meadow. {73}  Anyone standing in the churchyard at\r\nHagworthingham will see below him westward, just such a low-lying meadow,\r\ntraversed by a beck.  The second element in the name is “Worthing.”  Here\r\nwe seem to have the Saxon “Weorthig,” which enters into many a place-name\r\nas “Worth”; (compare Waddingworth, and Benniworth in the neighbourhood);\r\nwhich is derived from the old Saxon “Warian,” to ward or protect.  Hence\r\nthese two elements mean the warded, or fenced, meadow, and “Ham,” the\r\nlast element, also is Saxon, and means a place _hem_med in; but\r\nespecially the residence, the “home,” or the collection gathered round\r\nthe one house, now forming the “hamlet.”  What could give a more speaking\r\ndescription of the locality?  It is the homestead, and afterwards the\r\nresidences of the villagers gathered round it, whose position was on the\r\nhigher ground, because they wished to be above the low-lying enclosed\r\nmeadow, liable to be flooded by the brook, which runs through it, when\r\nswollen by the rain.  Even in these days of drainage universal, the\r\nfox-hunter, in crossing that grassy valley, may still find his steed\r\n“boggled” in the slough of quagmire.  In connection with this we may\r\nmention, that even in modern times, this dampness has not been forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn a note to Chap. ii. vol. i. of Smiles’ “Lives of Engineers,” it is\r\nstated that, when Dr. Whalley was appointed to the Rectory of this\r\nparish, it was with the singular proviso, that he should not reside in\r\nit, as the air was fatal to any but a native (Letters and Correspondence\r\nof T. S. Whalley, D.D.)\r\n\r\nAnother Norman soldier, named in Domesday as having a grant of land in\r\nHagworthingham from the Conqueror was Drogo de Bevere.  He was a Fleming\r\nby birth, and for his services in the cause of the King had many\r\nlordships given him in Lincolnshire and other counties.  Among others, he\r\nhad the lordship of all Holderness, in which was Beverley, whence he had\r\nthe title of “Terrius de Bevere.”  He was however of a very grasping and\r\noverbearing disposition.  Not content with the lordship of Holderness, he\r\nwished further to seize lands given by the King to the Church of St. John\r\nat Beverley.  Camden says that, as a mark of royal favour, he received in\r\nmarriage the Conqueror’s niece; but that he got rid of her by poison; and\r\nthen fled the country to escape the punishment he deserved.  He was\r\nsucceeded (his estates being probably confiscated) by Odo, Lord of\r\nAlbemarle, in Normandy (Camden “Britannia” p. 742, Ed. 1695.)\r\n\r\nTo this Drogo was granted all the land in Hagworthingham, which at the\r\nconquest had belonged to the Saxon Thane, Adestan, including “a hall,\r\nwith sac and soke” (or the right to hold a court of justice for the trial\r\nof misdemeanours), with 8 villeins occupying considerable lands under\r\nhim, and a mill of the value of 18d. yearly.  As his chief residence,\r\nwhen not in attendance on the King, would probably be in Holderness, he\r\nwas here represented by one Robert, who was his vassal.\r\n\r\nAnother name mentioned as having property in this parish, is Gozlin, son\r\nof Lambert, of whom little is known.  This was one of the 222 parishes in\r\nthe county which had a church before the Conquest; and Domesday Book\r\nstates that he had the church here, as well as a mill; but as it is added\r\nthat “the soke” (or jurisdiction) belonged to Gilbert de Gaunt, the\r\nlatter was evidently the superior lord.  Gozlin had lands in 39 parishes\r\nin Lincolnshire, besides those in other counties; but Gilbert de Gaunt\r\nhad 113 Manors in this county, besides 41 in other counties.\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned that, on the flight of Drogo de Bevere, after\r\npoisoning the Conqueror’s niece, his estates were transferred to Odo,\r\nEarl of Albemarle. {75}  Accordingly we find the old record, Testa de\r\nNevill, p. 336. (_Circa_ 1213), stating, “the Earl of Albemarle” holds of\r\nthe King (land) in Hagworthingham, which Gilbert de Langton holds, as his\r\nvassal.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the same old record states that the Earl of Chester,\r\nbesides other neighbouring possessions, held land of the King in\r\nHagworthingham, which the same Gilbert de Langton held under him, as his\r\nvassal.  This Earl was the only son of Hugh d’Abrincis (or Avranches),\r\none of the most important among the followers of the Conqueror, who was\r\nhis uncle.  William gave to him numerous manors in this and other\r\ncounties, and especially the earldom of Chester.  He was surnamed Lupus,\r\nor the Wolf, for his daring deeds.  It was supposed that he was granted\r\nthe county of Chester, that he might restrain the incursions of the\r\nneighbouring Welsh people, the stubborn descendants of the old Britons;\r\nand this he did with a vengeance, for, in conjunction with Hugh\r\nMontgomery, Earl of Shrewsbury, he took the Isle of Anglesey from the\r\nWelsh.  Later in life, to make up for his tyrannous proceedings, he\r\nbecame a monk of the Abbey of St. Werberg, of his own establishment in\r\nChester, and died there, in 1101.  The Earl of Chester held in\r\nLincolnshire about a score of manors, besides more than that number in\r\nLeicester, 32 in Suffolk, many in other counties, and the whole of\r\nCheshire.  At this stage the successive, or contemporary Lords of these\r\nmanors become too complicated a tissue to unravel here.  Some of the\r\nmanors became merged in the superior manor of Richmond or Bolingbroke;\r\nsome, in that of Greetham.  The Earl of Chester enfeoffed before his\r\ndeath, William de Hardyshall, of certain land in Hagworthingham, where\r\nhis descendant resided in the 14th century.  A Gilbert de Langton held\r\nland here as a vassal of Alan de Mumby; his son John, held the same lands\r\nunder a de Quincy.  Hawise de Quincy, Countess of Lincoln in her own\r\nright, had a daughter Margaret, who married John de Lacy, and the de\r\nLacies thus became Earls of Lincoln.  At one period, members of two\r\ndifferent families were at the same time Earls of Lincoln.  After a\r\nsuccession of steps, John of Gaunt became Earl of Lincoln, and ultimately\r\nDuke of Lancaster, and held many of these manors.\r\n\r\nWalter de Gant gave land in Hagworthingham to Bardney Abbey.  The Abbot\r\nof Bardney (“Placito de Warranto,” p. 409), claimed the right to have a\r\ngallows in Hagworthingham, as well as in Edlington and other places.\r\nOther owners were Laurence de Dikeby, who died 1270, Robert de Altomonte,\r\n1274, William de Saxill, in 1280.  Gilbert de Hagworthingham is named in\r\nan Assize Roll (No. 478, John A.D. 1202), Walter de Hagworthingham and\r\nhis son Philip, are named in an Assize Roll, 5 Ed. III. 1331.  In the\r\n14th century the Cupledyke family had land in Hagworthingham, _viz._,\r\nRoger de Cupledyke, who died 1324, and Alexander who died, 1335.  In the\r\n15 century, Thomas Blunt held a manor here, of the Duchy of Lancaster,\r\ndying in 1468. {76}  The great family of Welles, also connected with the\r\nDymokes, acquired lands here, which were forfeited after the battle of\r\nLoose-coat field, when Sir Robert Welles was attainted and executed at\r\nDoncaster, for espousing the Lancastrian cause, 1470.  In the next\r\ncentury the old county family of the Hansards held a manor here, by\r\nKnight’s service, of the Honour of Bolingbroke.  Sir William Hansard died\r\n1520, leaving as his heir his granddaughter Elizabeth.  Robert Marbury,\r\nin 1545 died, seized of a third part of a manor in this parish, which he\r\nleft to his son William.  Humphrey Littlebury, of East Kirkby, died Nov.\r\n3rd, 1558, seized of a manor here, which was connected with the superior\r\nmanor of Herby (probably Hareby, and equivalent to the Honour of\r\nBolingbroke), which he held of the Queen (Elizabeth) by fealty.  He also\r\nheld another manor here, of the Queen’s manor of Greenwich, which had\r\nbelonged to Bardney Abbey; the gift, as stated above, of Walter de Gaunt.\r\n\r\nJohn Littlebury, of Hagworthingham, Esq., by will, dated 20 June, 1535,\r\nrequests that he may be buried in the parish Church “before our Lady of\r\nthe Rood.”  He seems to have been a man of large property, for he\r\nbequeaths “to my wife £40, due to me from Mr. John Hercy; £4 of land in\r\nSomersby, Tetford, Skegness and Orby, to bring up my children in their\r\nnonage.”  This she is to have for life; and then Somersby and Tetford are\r\nto go to his son George and his heirs male; Skegness and Orby to his son\r\nPeter and heirs male, and failing them, to his son Humphrey, and his\r\nheirs.  “My sheep gate called Thorpe in the Mires (I leave) to my wife\r\nfor her life, and then to my son Humphrey and Ursulay his wife, according\r\nto the indenture between me and Mr. Hercy.  To my three daughters, my\r\nbrother Humphrey Myssendyne 10s. a year for life, out of my copyhold held\r\nof Lord Willoughby.”  His wife is to have the “putting in of the priests\r\nat Langton,” _i.e._, the presentation to the benefice for her life, and\r\nafter her death, the “first avoidence of one priest” is to go to his son\r\nHumphrey, the other to his son Thomas.  To his son Thomas his lands in\r\nKealcotes.  To his wife he leaves “my copyholds held of Lord Willoughby;\r\nand the farm of my son Langton, as long as the lease lasteth.”  Also “if\r\nmy wife be in decay in her widowhood, I will that she give no peny to her\r\ndaughters, of the £40 that is appointed to every of them, and if they be\r\nnot rewled by her in their marriage they are to have nothing.  Item.  I\r\nwill all my children be contente with the lands which was assigned to me\r\nby my brother, and the feoffe of my father’s purchased lands; and if\r\nthey, or any of them, be interrupted of the parts assygned to them by my\r\nneve Thomas, or his heires, I wyll they restate their tytyll of Richmonde\r\nfee, wych is the moyty of 360 akers, as it apperyth by a customar booke\r\nremaynyng with my wyfe, and a crosse set at the hede of it by Sir John\r\nLyttlebury my grandfader’s fader.  I appoint my brother John Eland\r\nsupervisior, and my wyfe ex’x.”  Witnesses, William Langton Gent, Sir\r\nMalmaduke Myssendyne and Sir Richard Cheles, of Ashby Puerorum.  Various\r\nother wills show that Thomas Littlebury had lands at Hagworthingham in\r\n1589, that Humphrey, of East Kirkby, held land in Hagg in 1568, and that\r\nMargaret Littlebury, of Stainsby, held land there in 1582.\r\n\r\nThe will of John Gedney, of Bag Enderby, mentions his lands in Hagg in\r\n1535.  The Gedneys were an old family in this neighbourhood.  In the\r\nchurch at Bag Enderby, there is a stone mural monument, commemorating\r\nAndrew Gedney and Dorothy his wife, with their two sons and two daughters\r\nkneeling before prayer desks, date 1591.  There is a slab of John Gedney\r\nin the floor, date 1535. {78}  Andrew Gedney married Dorothy, daughter of\r\nSir William Skipwith, of South Ormsby, in 1536.  Within recent years\r\nArthur P. H. Gedney, a cousin of the writer, owned Candlesby Hall, near\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nThe will of John Gannock, of Boston, shews that he also was a landowner\r\nhere, in 1583.\r\n\r\nIn 1572, Francis Bountague, died seized of a manor in Hagworthingham,\r\nwhich he held of the King, as of the manor of Greetham, of the Duchy of\r\nLancaster.\r\n\r\nJohn Littlebury, gent., of Hagworthingham, by will dated 27th March,\r\n1594, bequeaths to Mr. William Wray, “the ring that it pleased my lady,\r\nhis mother, to give me.”  The Lady Wray, would be the wife of Lord Chief\r\nJustice Wray (temp. Elizabeth), whose residence was at Glentworth—he died\r\nin 1592; they were an old Durham family.  The fine house at Glentworth\r\ncontinued to be the family residence of the Wrays, until Sir Cecil Wray,\r\nBart., erected “Summer Castle” at Fillingham, in 1760, so called from\r\nEsther Summers, Lady Wray.  Mr. John Littlebury also leaves to Sir George\r\nSt. Poll, “my half part of the hawks,” with bequests to other relatives.\r\nSir G. St. Poll or St. Paul, or Simpole, was a member of a good\r\nLincolnshire family, their chief residence being at Snarford.  Mr. John\r\nSaintpole was compulsively mixed up with the Lincolnshire Rising in 1536.\r\nThe grandson, George, was created a Baronet in 1611.  They were connected\r\nwith the Hansards, already mentioned as having land in Hagworthingham.\r\n\r\nYet one more will of a Littlebury concerns us.  John Littleburye (28 Sep.\r\n1611), requests to be buried in Hag church.  He leaves to the poor 20s.;\r\nto his son John, his land in Raithbye, for his life, and for his\r\n“bringing up in learning.”  £100 to his daughter Bridgett, “soe that shee\r\nbe ruled by mye wief her mother in marriage,” with £200 to be paid her\r\nwhen married.  “To my wief Anne the lease of Orbye from Mr Massingberd,\r\nalsoe my stocke and cattle, with all my plate and furniture.”  As the\r\nchildren are young he confirms an indenture previously made with Richard\r\nGedney, and others, to act as trustees.\r\n\r\nSir John Langton, of Langton, by will dated 25 Sep. 1616, also left to\r\nthe poor of Hagworthingham 10s., and like bequests to other places.\r\n\r\n(These particulars are taken from “Lincolnshire Wills,” by Canon\r\nMaddison).\r\n\r\nAmong “Final Concords,” there are agreements about lands in\r\nHagworthingham, under date 26 Oct. 1208, between Thomas de Winceby and\r\nGilbert and Osbert of Hag, under date 20 Jan. 1213–14, between Mary, the\r\nwife of Hugh, son of Robert, Ernald de Dunham acting for her and Hugh de\r\nHarrington, appertaining to her “reasonable dowery;” and under the same\r\ndate between the same Mary, and John de Bardney, as to land called\r\n“Sigwardes Croft,” in “Hacworthingeham, which Mary surrenders to John de\r\nBardney and his heirs,” he for this giving her 2 marks.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned that in the 14th century, Roger de Cupledyke\r\nwho died 1324, and Alexander, who died in 1335 had land in\r\nHagworthingham.  We also find that John Copledyke of Harrington, by will\r\ndated Palm Sunday, 1408, left to his sons lands in Hagworthingham, and\r\nother places.\r\n\r\nIn the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. a certain John Parker of this\r\nplace became somewhat notorious as a religious and political turncoat.\r\nHe made a public declaration “of the manner in which he had been drawn\r\nfrom the service of God to become a Papist,” dated 12 December, 1580; but\r\nin 1605, evidence was taken against him at Enderby, as to his making\r\ncertain seditious speeches, and he was pronounced to be a Recusant\r\n(“Domestic State Papers” James I. vol. xv. “Architect. S. Journal” 1865\r\np. 55).\r\n\r\nAt the present day the only one of the old families of proprietors in\r\nthis parish is the Rev. Alan Cheales above named, descended from Sir\r\nRichard Cheales who lived as far back as 1535.  At the present time Earl\r\nManvers is Lord of the Manor; Sir Henry D. Ingelby, Bart., the trustees\r\nof the late Rev. W. A. Bathurst, and the Wingate family are the principal\r\nlandowners, the larger portion belonging to Mr. Cheales.  We now proceed\r\nto the Church.  It is beautifully situated on the slope of a steep hill\r\ncommanding a view along a deep valley to the west, of fertile soil varied\r\nby copse and whin; and it is surrounded by a beautifully kept God’s acre.\r\nThe Church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, consists of tower, nave, south\r\naisle and chancel.  In the tower are 8 melodious bells.  The Church was\r\ncarefully restored and largely rebuilt in 1859; but still retains several\r\nof its original Early English features.  The tower, of green sandstone,\r\nbeing much decayed, had new belfry windows inserted, but still retains\r\nits patched appearance by a mixture of brick: the green and red tints\r\nblending harmoniously.  Towards the west end of the north wall is one of\r\nthe old Early English pilaster buttresses; and at the east bay of the\r\nsame wall is an original low-side window.  Within, the aisle arcade of\r\nfour bays is supported by circular-shafted pillars, having\r\nrudely-designed caps; the arches above being not sufficiently massive to\r\ncorrespond, and their junction clumsy.  These low arches produce a sort\r\nof “dim religious light.”  The aisle itself is entirely new; as are also\r\nthe seats and fittings generally.  The early English font has a plain\r\noctagonal bowl, supported upon a central shaft, and unengaged subsidiary\r\nshaftlets.  The east windows are modern, but may be reproductions of the\r\nold.  That in the east end (of three lights) is filled with coloured\r\nglass by Wailes, in memory of the Cheales family.  There is a modern\r\nbrass on the north side of the chancel, commemorating the Rev. Henry\r\nCheales sometime Vicar of Burton Pedwardine, “and for sixty-six years a\r\nlandowner of this parish,” 1870.\r\n\r\nN.B.—The Parish Registers contain a large numbers of names of this\r\nfamily.  The earliest mention of them is in the Church Book Topographical\r\nCollection of Sir Joseph Banks, 1786, where Hugh Cheales is given as one\r\nof the Churchwardens, 25 Henry VIII. (1534).\r\n\r\nThe window in the north wall is by Clayton and Bell, that in the south\r\nwall by Powell.  They commemorate the families of the late Rector the\r\nRev. F. Pickford, and his wife’s relatives, the Listers of Burwell Park;\r\none also being in memory of the late Prince Consort.  “The whole effect,”\r\nsays the late Bishop Suffragan, Dr. E. Trollope, one of our greatest\r\nauthorities, “is most pleasing and appropriate.”  Gervase Holles the\r\nantiquarian says that, when he visited the Church (temp. Chas. I.) there\r\nwas in the Chancel this fragmentary inscription, “Hic jacet . . .\r\nRedilston quondam Rector istius Ecclesiæ.”  He says also, “on a\r\ngravestone of blue marble in ye body of ye Church is pourtrayed in brasse\r\none in compleate armour, bearing upon ye manches of his coate of arms, on\r\neither side, 2 crescents.  Between his feet a right hand couped.  The\r\nrest is defaced.”  (Harleian MSS., No. 6829.)  The benefice was formerly\r\nin the gift of the Bishop of Ely (see Ecton’s “Thesaurus” p. 188); the\r\npatron is now the Bishop of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nIn the Registers were formerly some curious entries of “Briefs,” or Royal\r\nLetters, issued for various charitable objects, among 65 which were\r\npublicly read in Church in the 14 years from 1653 to 1667, 24 were for\r\nrelief in cases of loss by fire; others were for various purposes; one\r\nbeing “For the Church of Lithuania being under persecution” (1661). {82}\r\n\r\nWalter de Gaunt gave the manor, benefice, and six oxgangs of land, and “a\r\nview of frankpledge” in this parish to Bardney Abbey (Dugdale’s\r\n“Monasticon,” 1682, p. 143).\r\n\r\nIn sinking a well in 1897, on the property of Mr. Cheales in this parish,\r\nthere were found at a depth of about 45ft. fragments of “Brinkhill gold”\r\nand fossilized wood.  The gold has also been found in the churchyard.  It\r\nis pronounced, chemically, to be a form of silicate of aluminia.  Iron\r\npyrite is also found, abounding in small fossils.  The rectory is now\r\nheld by the Rev. G. R. Ekins.  The rectory house was built in 1841, a\r\nvery commodious residence, at a cost of about £2000, by the late Rector\r\nthe Rev. F. Pickford, the memory of whose family still remains in the\r\nparish, and many miles round it, as “a sweet smelling savour.”\r\n\r\nThere is a rent charge of £8 for the poor paid out of the estate, about\r\n700 acres, of the Cheales family.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. William Dales also in 1667 left land, the rent of which was for\r\nthe poor and the bell-ringers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMERINGHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nHameringham is about 4 miles from Horncastle, in a south-east direction,\r\nthe road passing through Mareham-on-the-Hill.  The marriage register\r\ndates from 1744, those for burials and baptisms from 1777.  Letters,\r\n_via_ Horncastle, arrive at 10 a.m.\r\n\r\nWe know little of the early history of this village; it is not named in\r\nDomesday Book, but in a list of military tenures, of the reign of Henry\r\nI. about A.D. 1108, the “Hundred of Hamringeheim” is mentioned, and\r\n“Count Richard,” probably the Norman Earl of Chester, is said to hold\r\nthere eleven carucates and four oxgangs, or nearly 1400 acres, and\r\nGilbert Fitz Gocelin had four oxgangs, or about 60 acres (“Old\r\nLincolnshire,” vol. i. pp. 213, 214).\r\n\r\nIn the year 1208 Henry, son of Geoffrey, granted to Ralph, Abbot of\r\nRevesby, and his successors, an oxgang of land and a messuage in\r\nHameringham; the said Ralph giving to the said Henry 20s., in\r\nconsideration thereof.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1529, Jane Sheffield, widow, of Croxby, in her will dated 7\r\nJanuary, refers to a deed of feoffment, dated 4 June, 8 Henry VIII.,\r\nwhereby Sir John Sheffield, Parson of Hameringham, and others are feoffed\r\nof certain lands, for her life; Sir John Sheffield and Alexander Amcotts,\r\nGent., being supervisors.  (“Lincolnshire Wills,” page 6, No. 14).\r\n\r\nIn 1540 John Angevin of Ashby by Horncastle, by will, dated 10 Oct. makes\r\nhis wife Margaret, executrix, and confirms to her lands in Ashby and\r\nHameringham, to remain in her hands “unto suche tyme, as all suche goods\r\nas I am bownden, and myne heyres, in covenants by indenture to Sir\r\nRycherde Warde, and to Sir Robert, be fully paid.”  To which is added, in\r\na different hand, “I Robert Awngeven agreed to this wyll.”  The Angevins\r\ndisappear in the 17th century; but one of the family held land in\r\nHameringham in the reign of Henry VIII. (“Lincolnshire Wills,” p. 28, No.\r\n72).  By will, dated 20 April, 1545, Robert Angevin, of Langton by\r\nHorncastle, leaves his land in Hameringham to his son William.  (Ibidem\r\np. 36, No. 96). {83}\r\n\r\nBy will, dated 10 Sept. 1612, George Litilburie, of Somersby, leaves to\r\nhis nephew Jeffery Litelburie all his apparell, and lands in Winceby and\r\nHameringham.  He wishes his armes to be “sette in the walle (of the\r\nchurch) as my grandfather’s was at Ashby (Puerorum).”\r\n\r\nAmong the Revesby charters is one, of date 1198, whereby Richard I.\r\ngrants and confirms to the monks of Revesby certain lands in Hameringham,\r\nEnderby, and elsewhere (Dugdale v. 456).\r\n\r\nBy a deed in the reign of Richard I., or John, William, son of Gaufrid,\r\nclerk, of Hameringham, gives to the monks of Revesby 9 acres of arable\r\nland in Hameringham, a meadow called “Baldvinegaire {84a} and pasture\r\nnear the 9 acres, and other lands; free of all service,” save that the\r\nmonks are to pay to the donor annually “two spurs of the cost of one\r\nnummus,” at Michaelmas.\r\n\r\nBy a deed early in the 13th century Symon, son of Hugo, of Dunsthorpe,\r\ngives to the monks one toft in Hameringham, and 10 acres, and one selion\r\nin a place called Thyrne, and 2 selions in Pesedalegate, {84b} free from\r\nall claims.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Henry III. Juetta, daughter of Alan, of Hameringham, gave\r\nto the Abbey of Revesby, 4 acres of arable land, for the purpose of\r\ngate-alms.  In the reign of Edwd. I. Robert Cressaunt of Tuluse gave his\r\nrights and claims on lands in Tuluse, Hameringham, and elsewhere, to the\r\nmonks of Revesby, on condition that they pay to him and his heirs\r\nannually 8_s._  Alicia the daughter of William, son of Alward of\r\nHameringham, in the same reign, gave a half toft for the Revesby almsbox;\r\nwith pasturage rights for 26 sheep and 4 cattle and 4 pigs in\r\nHameringham; the monks to pay to her 6_d._ annually.\r\n\r\nSir Lionel Dymoke, by will, dated 15 Ap. 1512, bequeathed “for churche\r\nwalke in hameringham xxd. to John Sheffield parsone of hameringham, . . .\r\nto pray for me, my wyf Anne, and my wyf Jane deceased, and for all\r\nchristen soules.”  “Linc. N. & Q.” iv. p. 12.\r\n\r\nOn the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII. that sovereign\r\ngranted to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, in consideration of his\r\n“acceptable and long service,” “all manner of houses, messuages, &c.,”\r\nalong with the lands, hitherto belonging to the monastery of Revesby,\r\nincluding property in Hameringham, and nearly 50 other parishes, to be\r\nheld of the crown, on payment of the fifth part of one soldier’s service,\r\nand an annual payment of £28 to the Court of Augmentations every\r\nMichaelmas, the duke’s title to date “from March 1, in the 29th year of\r\nour reign (1538).”\r\n\r\n[These different documents are among the Revesby charters, printed by the\r\nlate Right Honble. E. Stanhope, M.P.]\r\n\r\nThe benefice of Hameringham was formerly charged with a pension of 6s. to\r\nthe Prior of Bullington.  In the early part of the 18th century, the\r\nChaplin family would seem to have been proprietors here, as Mr. Thomas\r\nChaplin presented to the benefice in 1712 and 1720.  The manor now\r\nbelongs to the Coltman family, who are also patrons of the benefice; and\r\nthere are several smaller proprietors.\r\n\r\nScrafield, which has now no church, is united to Hameringham.  Some of\r\nthe communion plate is ancient, being Elizabethan, the rest is modern,\r\nbeing presented by the late Rector, Rev. Joseph Coltman.\r\n\r\nHameringham church, All Saints, stands appropriately on almost the\r\nhighest ground in the vicinity, so that the parishioners may look, and\r\nwend, upward to it.  It was restored by the present Rector, the Rev.\r\nBrice Smith, in 1894, the architect being Mr. Hodgson Fowler.  It now\r\nconsists of nave, chancel, and south aisle.  It has, doubtless, gone\r\nthrough vicissitudes at various periods, as is evidenced by remains and\r\nrecords.  In 1800 there was no chancel in existence.  In 1820 a chancel\r\nwas built by the then Rector, the Rev. Joseph Coltman.  There was at one\r\ntime a much larger edifice, of which the foundations were discovered by\r\nthe present Rector, in preparing for the restoration.  The chancel arch\r\nis Early English.  The west window is modern, perpendicular in style.  In\r\nthe north wall of the nave is one window, perpendicular, of three lights,\r\nnear the pulpit.  The pulpit is of plain oak, with the old hour glass\r\nframe still affixed to it, and containing an ancient hour glass,\r\nrecovered from a villager.  These remnants of the days of long discourses\r\nare now very rare.  There is still one in the church at Cowden, near\r\nEdenbridge, Kent.  The arcade of the south aisle is of the 13th century,\r\nrenewed in the 14th century with Lincoln stone.  It consists of three\r\nbays, with two octagonal pillars having carved capitals; the eastern-most\r\nsupport is a circular, single, small shaft, apparently Norman, with\r\ncarved capital, different from the others; where the moulding of the two\r\neastern arches meet, the corbel is a King’s head; these two arches are\r\nconsiderably broader than the western one, which is pointed.  This\r\nwestern pillar is the original 13th century one.  The south wall is of\r\nthe late 12th century, and the south porch arch is the original.  In the\r\nsouth wall are two windows east of the porch, and one west of it, each\r\nhaving two lights, and a quatrefoil above, style perpendicular.  There is\r\na piscina near the door.  The roof of the restored nave is of modern\r\npitch pine.  The chancel roof is considerably below the chancel arch.  It\r\nis apparently of wood, and has formerly been divided into panels.  The\r\nchancel is so long, that the communion table is placed 7 or 8 feet west\r\nof the east wall, and the space behind, shut off by drapery, forms a\r\nvestry.  The east window, in perpendicular style, is of 3 lights, with\r\nsix smaller lights above, within the arch.  The font is a very old and\r\ninteresting one, octagonal, on an octagonal shaft; the devices,\r\nquatrefoils, &c., on the faces of the bowl are much mutilated, those on\r\nthe shaft are perpendicular mouldings on 5 sides, and on the three other\r\nsides are grotesque figures, much mutilated, the centre one being winged,\r\nand supposed to represent St. Michael.  It stands on a plain oblong slab.\r\nThere is one good medieval bell, the other being the “Sanctus bell,”\r\nre-cast in the Jubilee year 1887, as it had become cracked.  The entire\r\nchurch is built of Spilsby green sandstone, faced in the porch with red\r\nDumfries stone.\r\n\r\nThe visitor to Hameringham from Horncastle, looking south and westward,\r\nwill see some beautifully wooded scenery, around Scrivelsby Park,\r\nHaltham, and beyond towards Revesby, Tattershall, &c. the view extending\r\neven beyond the Fens; with the spires of Heckington and other churches\r\ntowering up in the dim distance, twenty miles or more away, a most\r\ndelightful prospect.  Conspicuous among these objects is the magnificent\r\ntower, with its lantern, of what is commonly called Boston Stump.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAREBY.\r\n\r\n\r\nHareby is situated about 7 miles, in an easterly direction from\r\nHorncastle, is about 1 mile west of Bolingbroke, and 4½ miles from\r\nSpilsby.  From the first place it is approached by the old Roman road\r\nfrom Horncastle to Waynflete, as far as the cross-roads at Lusby, turning\r\nto the right for half-a-mile and then to the left.  It is a small parish,\r\nof less than 40 inhabitants, and comprising about 740 acres.  Letters,\r\n_via_ Spilsby, arrive at 8.30 a.m.  The nearest money order office is at\r\nBolingbroke, the nearest telegraph office at Spilsby.  Hareby Manor\r\nHouse, the property of Messrs. Ramsden and Taylor, stands on a steep\r\nhill-side, commanding extensive views over Bolingbroke, West Keal, and\r\nsouthward, far away to the waters of “The Wash.”  It has been said that\r\nthe name of Hareby, and probably also that of Eresby—the older name of\r\nSpilsby—is derived from the hares, which formerly abounded on these hills\r\nand valleys of the Wolds, the “South Wolds,” as we might here call them,\r\nof Lincolnshire. {87}  We are only able to recover fragmentary\r\nparticulars, “disjecta membra,” of the past history of this parish.  From\r\nDomesday Book we gather, that, like Miningsby, Bolingbroke, and many\r\nother neighbouring parishes, it was once the property of Ivo Taillebois,\r\nthrough his marriage with the Lady Lucia, heiress of the Saxon princely\r\nfamily of the Thorolds, whom the Conqueror bestowed upon him.  They were\r\nmarried in A.D. 1072, and on his death, without male issue, in 1114, the\r\nLady Lucia married Roger de Romara, who thus, through her, became Lord of\r\nBolingbroke, with other manors in the soke of that demesne.  At that\r\nperiod the parish would seem to have been more populous than it is at the\r\npresent day; the Domesday survey, giving the acreage as four carucates\r\n(or 480 acres), rateable to gelt; adds, that thirty-three socmen, five\r\nvilleins and five bordars had another four carucates, and 100 acres of\r\nmeadow.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Lucia, marrying as her 3rd husband the Norman noble, Ranulph, he\r\ndelivered some of her estates to the King, Henry I., in return for the\r\ndignity of the Earldom of Chester.  Against this, William de Romara, her\r\nson by her late husband, Roger de Romara, protested, but in vain.  Some\r\nyears later, however, Henry I. restored to him some of his mother’s\r\nproperty, and made him Earl of Lincoln; and later still, by the exchange\r\nof some lands in Normandy with Robert de Tillot, he acquired the\r\nlordships of Hareby, Hundleby and Mavis Enderby.  By his wife Maud,\r\ndaughter of Richard de Redver, he had a son William, who married Hawise,\r\ndaughter of Stephen, Earl of Albemarle.  The last of the Romaras dying\r\nwithout male issue, the property passed to Gilbert de Gaunt, who married\r\nhis daughter, who also succeeded to the Earldom of Lincoln.  Robert de\r\nGaunt forfeited the property by rebelling against King John, and the\r\nestates were conferred upon Ranulph de Meschines, surnamed de Blundeville\r\n(_i.e._, of Oswestry), Earl of Chester, A.D. 1100–1120.  He died with\r\nissue, but assigned to Hawise, one of his sisters, the Earldom and\r\nmanors.  She married Robert de Quincy, son of the Earl of Winchester,\r\nwhose daughter Margaret, married John de Lacy, a descendant of the Barons\r\nof Pontefract.  His son Edmund, left issue Henry (and others), who, dying\r\nwithout surviving issue, bequeathed his property to the heirs of Edmund\r\nPlantagenet; after various changes the property again came to a Gaunt,\r\nJohn, afterwards Duke of Lancaster, and father of Henry of Bolingbroke,\r\nwho later on succeeded to the throne as Henry IV. {88}  In the course,\r\nhowever, of the these changes, Hareby, and some other manors, had become\r\nseparated from Bolingbroke, and had passed to the Willoughby family,\r\nsince we find that in the time of Edw. III., father of Henry of\r\nBolingbroke, John Willoughby, held “the manors of Wester Kele with\r\nHareby, Lusby, Easter Kele, &c.”  (Chancery Inquisition, 46 Ed. III. No.\r\n78).  The family of Willoughby, although originally holding lands under\r\nthe Becs, who were lords of Spilsby, Eresby, &c., &c., subsequently\r\ninter-married with that family, and thus succeeded to some of their\r\nproperty, and were the ancestors of the family of the present Lords\r\nWilloughby d’Eresby, and eventually acquired very large possessions in\r\nthese parts, much of which they still retain.\r\n\r\nWe find, however, at different periods, various other parties holding\r\nlands in, or connected with, Hareby.\r\n\r\nIn a Revesby Charter (No. 28, collection of the late Right Hon. E.\r\nStanhope), conveying the right of lands in East Kirkby to Revesby Abbey\r\n(temp. Henry II. or Richard I.) the first witness is Alan, Dean of\r\nHareby, others being, Aschetill, priest of Keal, Alan, priest of Asgarby,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nBy another Charter (No. 53 temp. Richard I. or John), Henry Smerehorn of\r\nEast Kirkby, gives his home-born (“nativum”) servant, Robert, son of\r\nColvan, with all his chattells to Revesby Abbey, and receives in return\r\n“one silver mark from Peter, the monk of Hareby.”  This monk of Hareby\r\nwould therefore seem to be a nominee of the Abbot of Revesby.\r\n\r\nAnd this connection is confirmed by another charter (No. 92, temp. Henry\r\nIII.), by which the Abbot and monks of Revesby lease certain lands in\r\nStickney to Bricius, son of Roger, clerk of Stickney, to which deed the\r\nwitnesses are Walter of Hareby, at that time Prior of Revesby; Reginald\r\nthe cellarer, John of Moorby, Alan of Horncastle, &c., so that it would\r\nseem the former priest, or dean, of Hareby, was promoted to the Priorate\r\nof Revesby.\r\n\r\nBy another charter (No. 129, temp. Ed. I.), Alan son of Richard atte\r\nGrene (or, as we should now say, Richard Green) gives certain lands in\r\nEast Kirkby to the Abbey, the monks paying in return, “one farthing a\r\nyear” to Alan, son of William, son of Roger Palmer, of Hareby, and his\r\nheirs, at the feast of St. Botolph, for all claims on the land.\r\n\r\nBy another charter (150 B.), lands in Hareby, Bolingbroke, West Keale,\r\n&c., formerly belonging to Revesby Abbey, are conveyed by Henry VIII., on\r\nthe dissolution of the monasteries, to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk.\r\n\r\nAnother name, once well-known in the neighbourhood, is found connected\r\nwith Hareby, in the 15th century.  In a Chancery Inquisition, 32 Henry\r\nVI., 1453, taken at Horncastle, the witnesses on oath are Walter\r\nTailbois, Esq., William Dalison, of Hareby, and others.  The Dalisons\r\n(doubtless originally d’Alencon), were a very old Lincolnshire family,\r\nseated at Laughton, probably of Norman extraction.  In the 16th century\r\nSir Francis Ayscoughe a member of another very old county family {90a}\r\nmarried, as his 2nd wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Dighton, Esq., of\r\nStourton, and widow of Sir William Dalyson.\r\n\r\nIn 1635 Robert Bryan died, at Bolingbroke (March 7th) seized of lands in\r\nBolingbroke and Hareby, which he held of the Crown, a captain Bryan being\r\ngovernor of the Castle in the time of the Commonwealth, and a few years\r\nlater, (1663), a grant of leases in reversion of demesne land was made in\r\nfavour of the widow of Thomas Blagge, groom of the bedchamber {90b}\r\n(“Architect. S. Journal,” 1865, p. 57).\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned this manor as formerly being the property of the\r\nPlantagenets.  Of this there exists a curious piece of evidence.  One\r\nAlan de Cuppledyke, {90c} was appointed by Edward II. governor of\r\nBolingbroke castle, and his steward’s accounts still exist.  In one\r\npassage he says that “the open woods of Hundleby, Kirkby and Hareby\r\nThorns cannot be agisted (modern Linc. ‘gisted,’ _i.e._, let to be\r\nstocked with cattle), on account of the _new coppice_, planted by the\r\nlate Earl,” _i.e._, Thomas Plantagenet, the recent owner, the King’s\r\ncousin, but who had forfeited his property, by stirring up a rebellion.\r\nThis probably may be said to be the only wood in England which can be\r\nproved to have been planted by a Plantagenet (“Arch. S. Journ.” 1865, p.\r\n43).\r\n\r\nThe Littleburies, whose chief residence in this neighbourhood was\r\nStainsby House, in the parish of Ashby Puerorum, formerly owned land in\r\nHareby.  Humphrey Littlebury, of East Kirkby, in his will, dated 1 Sep.,\r\n1568, among other property mentions land in Hareby. {91}\r\n\r\nAnother old family connected with Hareby was that of the Skynners.  Henry\r\nSkynner of Bolingbroke, by his will of date 29 May, 1612, leaves to his\r\ndaughter Judith, all his copyholds in Harebie, and £100 when she is\r\nmarried, or 21 years of age; to his brother, Sir Vincent Skynner, knight,\r\nand his heirs, he bequeaths certain lands in Harebie, and other places,\r\nwith the advowson of the parsonage of Harebie, “all of which I lately\r\npurchased of him, on condition that he pay to my executor the sum of £60,\r\nwithin six months of my decease, which sum I have already paid for my\r\nsaid brother, unto Margery Neale of Horncastle, deceased, or else this\r\ngift is utterly void, and I give it to my daughters . . . I have made\r\nsurrender of all my customary messuages, lands, &c., in Bullenbroke and\r\nHarebie, into his Majestie’s hands by Vincent, in the name of one Grave,\r\nin the presence of Richard Smyth, gent., and others.”  This testator was\r\nthe son of John Skynner, and brother of Sir Vincent Skinner, of Thornton\r\nCurtis.\r\n\r\nMention has been made of Robert Bryan as owning land in Hareby, in 1635.\r\nMembers of the same family would seem to have had property there nearly a\r\ncentury later, as John Bryan was patron of the benefice in 1754, and\r\nunited it to that of Bolingbroke.  In 1555 King Philip and Queen Mary\r\npresented Gilbert Skroweston to Hareby; but in 1779 the patronage of the\r\nunited benefice had passed to Matthew Wildbore, Esq.  In 1834 the patron\r\nwas Earl Brownlow; in 1836, C. Bosanquet, Esq.; and in 1863, Sir John W.\r\nSmith, Bart.; after him the trustees of the late G. Bainbridge, Esq.,\r\nheld the patronage, which now has passed to C. S. Dickinson, Esq.  The\r\nowners of the estate are now Messrs. Ramden and Taylor, and it is managed\r\nfor them by their relative, G. Mariner, Esq.\r\n\r\nThe church, dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul, was rebuilt in 1857–8,\r\nat a cost of about £450.  It consists of nave and chancel, with belfry,\r\nhaving one bell, the fabric being constructed of brick.  Sir J. W. Smith,\r\nthe then patron, built the nave, and the chancel was built by the then\r\nRector, the Rev. E. Stanley Bosanquet.  The east widow, of coloured\r\nglass, with the crucifixion, was erected in memory of William Bernard\r\nWingate, a late owner, by members of his family.  There is another\r\ncoloured window in the south wall of the chancel, without inscription,\r\nbut probably erected by the Wingate family; and there is a marble tablet\r\nin the north wall of the nave, in memory of the late owner of the estate,\r\nFrederick Tooth, Esq., of Sevenoaks, Kent.  The register dates from 1567.\r\n\r\nHareby Manor House is a handsome, substantial structure, standing on a\r\nslope, looking towards Old Bolingbroke, and surrounded by extensive\r\ngardens and good farm buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHATTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nHatton lies about 7½ miles from Horncastle, to the north-west, and about\r\n4 miles south-east of Wragby; being about ½ a mile eastward of the high\r\nroad between those two places.  Letters, _via_ Wragby, the nearest money\r\norder and telegraph office, arrive at 10 a.m.  The register dates from\r\n1552.  There are also entries relating to this parish, from 1695 to 1799,\r\nin the Baumber register.  The name Hatton, as a parallel to Hatcliffe,\r\nHatfield, Hatfield Chase, &c., doubtless means a “ton,” _i.e._, “town,”\r\nor protected enclosure, on an open “heath”: pointing to a time when the\r\nneighbourhood was more or less a wild tract; and when the neighbouring\r\nWragby (from Vargr, a wolf, or outlaw), was the haunt of wild beasts, or\r\nthe no less dangerous human robber.\r\n\r\nThe Church, dedicated to St. Stephen, described by Weir in his “History\r\nof Lincolnshire” (vol. i. p. 296, Ed. 1828), as a small building,\r\npossessing no claim to attention, and by Saunders (vol. ii. p. 71, Ed.\r\n1834) in nearly the same terms, was at that time in the gift of the\r\nwell-known, somewhat eccentric, but popular member for Lincoln, Colonel\r\nSibthorpe; the Rev. H. W. Sibthorpe being Rector.  In 1863 it was in the\r\ngift of G. W. Sibthorpe, Esq., and in 1869 in that of Coningsby C.\r\nSibthorpe, Esq., being then held by the Rev. C. E. Jarvis.  The latter\r\nresigned in 1891, since which time it has been held by the Rev. W. T.\r\nBeaty-Pownall, who has a good rectory house, built in 1871, at a cost of\r\n£1,300 the late Mr. James Fowler being the Architect.  It does not appear\r\nto have been long in the patronage of the Sibthorpe family, as in 1711\r\nthe patrons were Sir Richard Wynch, Bart., and Rebecca Wynch, widow;\r\nwhile in 1750, and again 1780 Sir Robert Lawley, Bart, presented.  The\r\ntrustees of W. H. Sibthorpe, Esq., are first-named as patrons in 1824.\r\nIn the calendar (No. 1), of Institutions to Benefices, from 1540 to 1570\r\npreserved in the Alnwick Tower, Old Palace, Lincoln (“Architect. Soc.\r\nJournal,” 1897) fol. 22b. 176, we find “William Mershall, clerk, pres. by\r\nW. Dighton of the City of Lincoln, gent., to the church of Hattone, vac.\r\nby the resignation of Sir William Smith; inst. Vicar, A.D. 1550.” {93}\r\nThe Dightons were originally a mercantile family, of Lincoln, who filled\r\nthe offices of Mayor and Sheriff, and amassed fortunes.  One of them,\r\nRobert, became owner of Old Stourton Magna Hall, the moated remains of\r\nwhich can still be traced in a field about a mile to the west beyond the\r\nStourton Parva plantations.  A daughter of Thomas Dighton of that place,\r\nmarried Edward Clinton of Baumber, who afterwards became Earl of Lincoln.\r\nIn the parish Register of Stourton Magna is the entry “Alice ye wife of\r\nRob Diton was buried ye 14 Jany. 1688,” and as there are no later entries\r\nof the name, this Robert was probably the last to reside there.  There\r\nwere other Dightons at Waddingworth and Horkstow.  We find, however,\r\nearlier notices of Dightons residing in Hatton.  In 1544 by his will,\r\ndated 1 May, “John Dighton of Hatton” requests to be “buried in the\r\nchurchyard of St. Elwold in Hatton.”  He leaves a bequest for his\r\nbrother, “Robert Dighton, parson of Haltham,” and the residue to his\r\nwife, Agnes, his executrix; his two fathers-in-law, Thomas Dighton and\r\nWilliam Chatterton, being “supervisors.”  He evidently died early in\r\nlife.  As to the expression “the churchyard of St. Elwold,” there seems\r\nto be no explanation forthcoming.  Possibly there was a chapelry in the\r\nparish, with separate burial grounds.  In 1606 we find another John\r\nDighton, residing at Minting, who, by his will, dated 28 Dec. of that\r\nyear, leaves 40s. to the poor of Baumber, Minting, and Hatton.  Other\r\nnames in connection with this parish are as follows:—Among Lincoln Wills\r\nis one made by “Roger Holmes, of Hatton, gent.” dated 15 May, 1611, in\r\nwhich he makes various bequests of no particular interest.  In 1613 John\r\nWharfe of Wickenby, by will dated 18 Sept., leaves to his sons lands in\r\nHatton, which he had on a mortgage, from his father-in-law Smythe.  And\r\nin 1616, by will dated 12 November, “Heneage Smith of Hatton,” leaves\r\n“lands in Hatton for a schoolmaster.”  He says that he received nothing\r\nfrom his son-in-law, J. Wharfe, for the mortgage, but that, nevertheless,\r\nhe leaves certain moneys for his (J. Wharfe’s) sons, because they are his\r\ngrandsons.\r\n\r\n(N.B.—These notices are from “Lincolnshire Wills,” by Canon Maddison.)\r\n\r\nThe Church of Hatton was re-built in 1871; entirely of brick, except the\r\nstone facings.  It consists of a nave, chancel, and small spire on the\r\nsouth side of the chancel, containing one bell.  Its chief features are\r\nas follows:—the east window, of coloured glass, has three separate\r\ntrefoiled lights, in memory of Waldo Sibthorpe, Rector, who died, 14 Nov.\r\n1865, the subjects are, in the centre, the Crucifixion; in the northern\r\nlight, the Agony in the Garden; in the south light, the Resurrection,\r\n“Noli me tangere.”  In the north chancel wall are two brass tablets, one\r\nrecording that £100 was left by Mary Esther Waldo Sibthorpe in trust to\r\nthe Rector, for the poor of the parish; the other, that £100 was given by\r\nCharles Edward Jarvis, in trust to the Rector, for the benefit of the\r\nparish.  In the north wall is one two-light Early English window, and one\r\nsingle-light window in the same style.  In the south wall is one\r\nsingle-light window, the vestry door, and organ chamber, over which\r\nstands the tower and spire.  In the north wall also is a credence table\r\nof stone, with trefoiled arch.  The east end is in the form of an apse.\r\nThe chancel arch, and that of the organ chamber, terminate in elaborately\r\nfoliated finials.  In the nave, the pulpit is of Caen stone, a device in\r\none panel being a cross within a quatrefoil, surrounded by a circular\r\nmoulding.  In the nave north wall, near the pulpit are a pair of\r\ntwo-light windows, with trefoils above; and westward is a three-light\r\nwindow with quatrefoil above.  In the south wall of the nave is one\r\ntwo-light window, with two trefoils, and a circle above; and one\r\nthree-light window corresponding to that in the north wall.  The lectern\r\nis of oak.  The font is of Caen stone, with fluted bowl in eight\r\npartitions, and supported by eight round columns.  The sittings, for\r\nfifty, and the roof throughout, are of pitch-pine.\r\n\r\nThe Rectory, close by, is a commodious and substantial residence in good\r\ngrounds.  In a field to the south of the gardens are remains of former\r\nstews, or fishponds, and two rather large boulders, {95} which have\r\nevidently been ice-borne, and like many others in the neighbourhood, are\r\nof carboniferous “Spilsby” sandstone of the Neocomian period.  The soil\r\nof the parish generally, is a heavy clay; and in a brickyard adjoining\r\nthe Horncastle and Wragby road, are numerous ammonites and other fossils.\r\n\r\nThere is a yearly rent charge of £6 left by Heneage Smith, in 1616, for\r\nthe education of poor children, which is paid out of the estate of\r\nConingsby C. Sibthorpe, Esq.; 14s. 2d. was left by William Marshall, in\r\n1557, for poor parishioners, to be paid out of land at Minting, but this\r\nhas fallen into abeyance.  Edmund Turnor, Esq., is lord of the manor but\r\nC. C. Sibthorpe, Esq., owns the greater part of the soil.  “Midge Inn,”\r\nwhich has the reputation of formerly being the haunt of the highwayman,\r\nwho lightened the pocket of many a traveller on the King’s highway, is on\r\nthe Horncastle and Wragby road in this parish, which is in the soke of\r\nWragby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMINGBY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis parish lies 4 miles north by west from Horncastle, on the river\r\nBain.  Letters, _via_ Horncastle, which is the nearest money order\r\noffice, arrive at 9.30.  The Incumbent is the Rev. E. S. Bengough, who\r\nhas a commodious Rectory.  The register dates from 1579.\r\n\r\nThe Church is dedicated to St. Margaret.  A previous structure, erected\r\nin nondescript, “Grecian,” style, in 1771 (a period when so many of the\r\nchurches in the neighbourhood were re-modelled in the worst taste),\r\nconsisting of nave, chancel, and low tower, with three bells, was\r\nre-seated in 1856, when additional accommodation was provided.  A west\r\ndoor, made of bog oak, from a large tree dug up, when the railway line\r\nwas made between Boston and Lincoln, was presented by the Rev. E. Walter,\r\nRector of Langton.  The entire fabric was restored in 1896, at a cost of\r\n£1450, and re-opened in January of that year, through the liberality and\r\nexertions of the Rector, Rev. E. S. Bengough, aided by handsome donations\r\nfrom Earl Manvers, the family of the late Rector, Rev. G. Thackeray, and\r\nothers.  The tower was entirely re-built and the chancel enlarged.  A\r\nrelic of a former medieval church was found in the pavement of the nave,\r\nconsisting of a slab, carved with two quatrefoils, with shields in the\r\ncentre of each.  This was placed in the wall of the chancel, above the\r\neast window.  The pulpit, of carved oak, was the gift of the family of\r\nthe Rev. G. Thackeray, the late Rector.  The architect was Mr. W. Scorer,\r\nof Lincoln.  The bells, of the 18th century, bear the names of the\r\nfounders, Mears and Stainbanks, of London.\r\n\r\nAt the date of Domesday Book, the great Norman Baron, Ivo Taylebois,\r\nowned land in this parish, as Earl Harold had done before him.  Baldric,\r\none of the Earl’s vassals, had there one carucate, and two villeins, and\r\ntwo bordars, and seven sokemen, who had two carucates, and half a mill,\r\nworth 7s. yearly, and 30 acres of meadow.  There were three carucates,\r\nrateable to gelt.  The manor, held by Edric, had six oxgangs, also\r\nrateable to gelt.  Its value, temp. Edwd. the Confessor, was 60s., in\r\nDomesday 100s.\r\n\r\nAmong the gentry of Lincolnshire, enrolled in the List made by the King’s\r\nHeralds, at their visitation in 1634, was Ambrose Shepard of this parish\r\n(Everard Green, F.S.A., “Lincs. N. & Q.,” p. 105).\r\n\r\nIn Liber Regis, the living was valued at £17 8_s._ 6½_d._, now at £500;\r\n423 acres being allotted at the enclosure in lieu of tithes and the old\r\nglebe.  In 1722 the benefice was in the gift of the Rev. Mr. Carr of\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne; after that the patronage was vested in King’s College,\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\nThere is an endowed School, for master and mistress, founded by Jane\r\nDymoke, widow of the champion, in 1727, and endowed by her in 1736, for\r\nteaching the children of the poor of the parish, “to read, write, spin,\r\nand card wool.”  Commodious schoolrooms for boys and girls have been\r\nerected in late years.  Lands in Woodhall yield an income of about £110 a\r\nyear.  There is a rent charge of £5 on a farm in Asterby, and £568 in\r\nconsols.  The whole yearly income is about £130, besides residence and 20\r\nacres of land for the master.  Four almswomen receive 2_s._ 3_d._ weekly,\r\nwith an allowance of fuel.  Four apprentices are provided for with a\r\npremium of £10, and £3 a year for clothing, during the 7 years of their\r\nservice.  The late Mrs. Baker, in 1848, also left the interest of £500 to\r\nbe distributed in coals among the poor of the parish.  The living is now\r\nin the gift of King’s College, Cambridge; but by an Inquisition held at\r\nBoston, 12 Henry VII. (A.D. 1497) it was found that Sir John Ratclyff,\r\nknight, besides considerable other property in the county, was seised of\r\nthe advowson of Hemingby, and alternate advowson of Skyrbeck, but he\r\nbeing attainted, in the 11th year of that King, his property passed to\r\nAndrew Dymmock, as the Kings “Solidat” (soldier).  (“Linc. N. & Q.,” iv.,\r\np. 11.)  In 1711 Leonard Smelt, Esq., presented to this benefice; in 1722\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Carr, of Newcastle, gent.; and King’s College for the first\r\ntime in 1768.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKIRKBY-ON-BAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nKirkby-on-Bain is a village larger than most of those in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood, situated on the river Bain, between 4 and 5 miles from\r\nHorncastle, in a southerly direction, about 4 miles north-east of\r\nTattershall, and rather less south-east of Woodhall Spa, where are the\r\nnearest railway station, money order, and telegraph office, there being a\r\npost office in the village.\r\n\r\nIt was a saying of one of our chief archæologists, that “anciently every\r\nlocal name had its meaning”; and we may extract more than conjectural\r\nhistory from the name, Kirkby-on-Bain.  The first syllable carries us\r\nback into a distant past, earlier than the date of most of our written\r\nrecords.  As a rule, when the word “Kirk” forms part of a place-name, it\r\nimplies, not only the former existence of a church in the locality (the\r\nname in Domesday is “Chirchebi,”) but also of a still earlier, and\r\nprobably Druid, temple.  The syllable “Kir,” or “Ker,” {98a} with its\r\nplural Kerrog, Kerig, or Curig (hence “Church”) means a sacred circle,\r\nwhich was the form of the ancient British, or Druid, place of worship,\r\nsuch as are still to be seen, on a large scale, in the megalithic remains\r\nof Stonehenge near Salisbury, and at Avebury near Marlborough, in\r\nWiltshire; and, on a smaller scale, in many a lonely spot among the hills\r\nin Wales and Scotland, and on the continent, as far Palestine.  These\r\nremarks apply to many places in our own neighbourhood, as Kirkstead,\r\nKirkby Green, beyond the once sacred stream of the Druids, the Witham, or\r\nRhe, East Kirkby beyond Revesby, &c.  We have 5 Kirkbys, and 2 Kirtons\r\n(Kirk-ton), in the county.  Thus we get a British origin for this parish;\r\nwhile the name of the river, on which it is situate, is also British; the\r\nword “Ban,” meaning “bright,” or “clear,” is found not only in the river\r\nBain, but in several other streams. {98b}\r\n\r\nThe second syllable of the name Kirkby yields further information.  While\r\nthe two contiguous parishes of Kirk-stead and Kirk-by have the first\r\nsyllable in common, in their suffix, they differ, since “stead,”\r\nconnected with our word “steady,” is Saxon, meaning a settled domicile;\r\nand “by,” is an old Danish word, (still surviving in Scotland as “byre”)\r\nmeaning the same. {99a}\r\n\r\nThe Britons, therefore, have left their mark in the first half of both\r\nthese names, but from the second halves we gather that the Saxons made\r\ntheir permanent residence in Kirkstead, whereas in Kirkby, although they\r\ndoubtless there also succeeded the Britons, they were, in turn,\r\nsupplanted by the Danes, who made this place their “byre,” or “by,” with\r\nthree “by-roads,” or village roads, branching from it.\r\n\r\nIn this connection we may also note, that “Toft,” which is a farm name in\r\nthe parish, is also a Danish word, and this is another of their\r\n“footprints on the sands of time”; while further we may observe, that\r\nthose roving invaders were called “Vikings,” because they first\r\nfrequented our “viks,” “wicks,” or creeks; and there are geological\r\nindications, in the beds of sand and gravel, in this parish, that the\r\nriver Bain was, at one time, much wider and deeper than it is in the\r\npresent day {99b}; and so, we may well suppose, that, up this “ancient\r\nriver,” the river Bain, those Danish marauders steered their way, from\r\nits mouth at “Dog-dyke,” originally Dock-dyke, because there was a Dock,\r\nor Haven, for shipping there (as the present Langrick was a long-creek of\r\nthe sea, a few miles beyond; the sea then coming up from Waynfleet); and\r\nmade their settlement here, from which they ousted the Saxons, whose\r\npresence is implied in the name of the hamlet Tumby, originally Tunne-by,\r\nwhich is, in part, a Saxon appellation.\r\n\r\nThus, by the analysis of a name we are brought down from those far-off,\r\ndark ages to within the range of historic times.  Kirkby is stated to be\r\nin “the soke of Horncastle,” in a document of date 1327–8 (“Lincolnshire\r\nN & Q.” vol. v., No. 44., p. 248), but the local historian, Mr. Weir\r\n(“Hist. Horncastle,” p. 310, Ed. 1828) says, that it had a jurisdiction\r\nof its own, including Kirkstead, and even more distant parishes, as\r\nWispington, and Waddingworth. {100a}\r\n\r\nThe Domesday survey of this county, made in 1089, by order of William the\r\nConqueror, and so named by the Saxons, because it recorded the doom of\r\nmany a Saxon Thane, ejected from his possessions by Norman warriors,\r\ncontains several notices of this parish; and although at first sight they\r\nappear somewhat conflicting, yet a careful study of them enables us to\r\nput together something like a connected account of some of its former\r\nproprietors.\r\n\r\nFirst we may mention the Saxon owners, who were dispossessed of their\r\nlands by the Normans.\r\n\r\nOne of these was Ulmar, who had 150 acres, charged with the land tax,\r\ncalled “gelt,” which was about 2_s._ to the carucate (or 120 acres);\r\nbesides which he had 1½ carucates (180 acres), sub-let to smaller bond\r\ntenants, making in all 330 acres.  He had also in the adjoining parish of\r\nTattershall Thorpe, 240 acres, “in demesne,” _i.e._, in his own\r\noccupation, as Lord of the Manor, besides 360 acres sub-let to\r\ndependents.  Ulmar was therefore what we should call, “well to do,” a\r\nSaxon yeoman of substance.\r\n\r\nThere were also two other Saxon owners in the parish, who would seem, to\r\nsome extent, to have been partners.  Godwin and Gonewate had between them\r\n60 acres in Kirkby, charged with the aforesaid payment of “gelt,” and 75\r\nacres exempt from it.  They had also 360 acres in Tattershall Thorpe; and\r\nseparately, or together, they had lands in several other parishes.\r\nEspecially in Tumby, they owned 300 acres rateable to “gelt,” and 360\r\nacres more sub-let to dependents.\r\n\r\nAnother part of this parish would seem to have been a separate demesne,\r\nFulsby, probably a contraction of Fugels-by, or the homestead of Fugel.\r\n{100b}  Here, at a later period, there was a large residence, named\r\n“Fulsby Hall” of which possibly there may be still some traces in ponds\r\nand mounds, in a field in the middle of what is still called “Fulsby\r\nWood.”\r\n\r\nToft Grange also would seem to have been another distinct property; and\r\nwas at a later date (as will be shown hereafter), owned or occupied by a\r\nDymoke.  The term “Grange” would imply that it was an appendage of some\r\nReligious House; and an old charter of Richard I., now in the Library of\r\nRevesby Abbey, shows that that Sovereign granted to the Monks of St.\r\nLawrence at Revesby, the Grange of Toft, {101a} with its appurtenances, a\r\nmill at Fulsby, with lands in Tumby, Coningsby, &c.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of Tumby was, as it is still, woodland, and formed\r\n“Tumby Forest,” or “Tumby Chase,” of which old maps still show the trees.\r\n{101b}\r\n\r\nIn a Close Roll, 5 Ed. IV. (1466), there is a reference to the great\r\nwood, called “Tumbi Wode,” or “Tumbi Chase” (“Ibiden,” p. 131).\r\n\r\nWe have, thus far, three Saxon proprietors in this parish, who were, in\r\ntheir day, men of substance; but the incoming of the Norman was the\r\nSaxon’s doom; and while Domesday Book says, with pregnant brevity, that\r\nUlmar, Godwin, and Gonewate “had,” _i.e._ formerly owned, such and such\r\nlands, it names the Normans alone as present proprietors.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Kirkby the accounts also of these Norman Lords might seem,\r\nat first sight, somewhat conflicting.  For instance, Domesday Book gives\r\nOdo, Bishop of Baieux as owner of this parish, or a large portion of it;\r\nbut we turn over only a few pages, and find it referred to as among the\r\npossessions of William de Karilepho, Bishop of Durham.  But “hereby hangs\r\na tale.”  Odo of Baieux was half brother of William the Conqueror; being\r\nthe son of Arlette, the concubine of his father, Robert, Duke of\r\nNormandy, by a Norman Noble, Herluin de Contaville.  Odo’s brother was\r\ncreated Earl of Moretaine, his sister was the Countess d’ Aumale (which\r\nin later times became Albemarle), and he was given by the Duke, in 1049,\r\nthe high position of Bishop of Baieux, in the now department of Calvados,\r\nin Lower Normandy. {102a}  On coming to England in the train of the\r\nConqueror, he was created Earl of Kent, Count Palatine, and “Justiciarius\r\nAngliœ,” and no less than 439 manors were bestowed upon him, 76 of these\r\nbeing in Lincolnshire.  He was thus among the most powerful of the\r\nNormans in this country; he was styled “Vice-Lord of the whole of\r\nEngland,” and was said to be “second only to the King.”  But his\r\ngreatness was his ruin.  Elated by his vast wealth, he aspired to the\r\nPapacy, and collecting a great amount of treasure, he was about to set\r\nsail for Rome, when William seized him and his treasure, and sent him to\r\nprison in Normandy, confiscating his estate. {102b}  Thus Odo’s tenure of\r\nhis lands in Kirkby and elsewhere, was only brief; and there were other\r\ngrasping Norman followers of the Conqueror ready to step into his shoes.\r\nOne of these was the aforenamed William de Karilepho, Bishop of Durham;\r\nwho had been Abbot of St. Karilepho in Normandy, but, coming over to\r\nEngland, was consecrated to that Palatine See in 1082.  Thus Kirkby again\r\nbecame the property of a scarcely less powerful prelate than Odo; for the\r\nBishops of Durham have ranked high in the episcopate down to quite recent\r\ntimes; but in early days they were not only bishops, but princely nobles,\r\nwhose influence almost rivalled that of the Sovereign; and this prelate\r\nagain was Chief Justice of England.  An indirect evidence of the Bishop\r\nof Durham’s influence in Kirkby is seen in the following circumstance.\r\nBoth Ecton’s “Thesaurus,” and “Liber Regis,” state that the benefice of\r\nKirkby formerly paid a “pension of 40_s._ to the Priory of St. Leonard at\r\nStamford.”  This would appear to have come about in the following manner.\r\nOswy, the Saxon King of Northumbria, in the middle of the 7th century of\r\nthe Christian era, having conquered the pagan King of Mercia, of which\r\nLincolnshire formed a part, as a thank-offering to God, gave to Wilfred,\r\nthe friend and instructor of his son Alchfrid, certain lands in Stamford,\r\nfor the maintenance of 100 Monks.  Accordingly Wilfred, who afterwards\r\nbecame Bishop of York, founded the Priory of St. Leonard at Stamford;\r\nand, having received his own education at the Monastery of Lindisfarne,\r\nin Holy Island, he gave the Priory to that Religious House.  At the time\r\nof the Conquest, the Monks of Lindisfarne, were attached to the See of\r\nDurham, and thus their dependency at Stamford came under the cognizance\r\nof William de Karilepho; and as Lord of the Manor of Kirkby, he charged\r\nthis benefice with this contribution to the Priory.  Had the Monks of\r\nLindisfarne not been plundered by the Danes, and so driven to Durham,\r\nKirkby would not have had this payment to make; “40_s_” was, in those\r\ndays a considerable sum, the whole tithes of the benefice being only £1\r\n7_s._ 4¼_d._  The buildings of the Priory at Stamford, were plundered by\r\nthe Danish rovers, but were rebuilt by William de Karilepho, partly\r\ndoubtless with money from Kirkby, about the year 1082.  On the\r\ndissolution of the Monasteries, in the reign of Henry VIII. that King,\r\nwho was generally in need of cash, appropriated the temporalities of the\r\nbenefice of Kirkby, and so became patron of the living, which is still in\r\nthe gift of the Sovereign.\r\n\r\nWe now get another name of rank among the Normans connected with Kirkby.\r\nDomesday Book says, “Ilbert has here 1 caracate (120 acres), with 10\r\nvilleins (the lowest class of bondmen), and 4 bordars (the higher class\r\nof bondmen), who hold under him another carucate; also the site of a mill\r\n(a valuable possession in those times), 12 acres of meadow (probably rich\r\ngrass land watered by the Bain), and 160 acres of woodland interspersed\r\nwith pasture,” where the serfs would tend the lord’s herds of swine,\r\nwhich fattened on the acorns in their season, and where he would harbour\r\nhis deer, and other animals of the chase.\r\n\r\nIn those times even a powerful noble did not disdain to be the vassal of\r\nsuch a princely prelate as the great Bishop of Durham, at the head of one\r\nof the three palatine counties in England; and such was this Ilbert, or,\r\nas he was otherwise called, Hildebert de Lacy.\r\n\r\nComing to England with the Conqueror, he was granted by William the manor\r\nof Pontefract, and 150 other lordships in Yorkshire, 10 in\r\nNottinghamshire, and 4 in Lincolnshire.  In several other parishes,\r\n{104a} Kirkby being among them, he also held lands, not absolutely “in\r\ndemesne,” as his own, but under the absentee Bishop of Durham as lord\r\nparamount, to whom he paid a small yearly rent, which was exacted from\r\nhis Saxon dependents.  This Ilbert, or Hildebert, built the castle of\r\nPontefract, {104b} and was one of the most powerful nobles in Yorkshire.\r\nAnother of his family, also Ilbert, was a witness to the Charter of King\r\nStephen, which secured the ecclesiastical liberties of England; and\r\nanother, John de Lacy, became Earl of Lincoln, by marrying Margaret,\r\ndaughter of Hawise de Quincy, sister of Ranulph, Earl of Lincoln and\r\nChester (A.D. 1232).  Their son, Henry de Lacy, held the same honours in\r\nthe reigns of Henry III. and Ed. I. {104c}  A John de Lacy was among the\r\nsignatories of the Magna Charta, and we may add that it is not a little\r\nremarkable that, in this 20th century, the name of Ilbert is yet to the\r\nfore, Sir Courtenay Peregrine Ilbert, K.C.S.I., C.I.E., &c., being now\r\nClerk of the House of Commons, and a distinguished lawyer and scholar.\r\n\r\nBy a curious coincidence, Pontefract was in Saxon times known by the name\r\nof Kirkby, and this name continued even in later times; a charter of\r\nIlbert’s son, Robert, conveying lands to the Priory of St. John at\r\nPontefract, mentions them as being “de dominio de Kirkby,” while another\r\ncharter gives them as “de Pontefract” (Camden’s “Britannia,” p. 729.)\r\nThus Ilbert, Lord of Kirkby-on-Bain, held two lordships in different\r\ncounties, of the same name.\r\n\r\nWe have yet another landowner named as connected with this parish, of\r\nscarcely less note than Ilbert de Lacy.\r\n\r\nAs we have observed in our “Records” of other parishes, Eudo, son of\r\nSpirewic, and Pinso, were two Norman sworn brothers in arms, who came\r\nover with the Conqueror, and did him such good service that William\r\ngranted them “the manor of Tattershall with the hamlet of Thorpe and the\r\ntowne of Kirkeby,” beside some 24 other lordships; Eudo to have tenure\r\ndirectly from the King, and Pinso under St. Cuthbert of Durham.  They\r\nsubsequently divided these possessions between them, Pinso taking those\r\nfurther away, while Eudo seated himself at Tattershall.  On his death\r\nthere, he was succeeded by his son, Hugh Fitz Eudo, commonly called\r\n“Brito,” or “The Breton,” who founded the neighbouring abbey of\r\nKirkstead, A.D. 1139.  He had in Kirkby 1 carucate (120 acres) of land\r\n“in demesne,” with 8 acres of meadow and 80 acres of woodland\r\ninterspersed with pasture, very much as “Kirkby Moor” is still.  He had\r\nalso in Tumby another carucate, in his own occupation, with villeins and\r\nbordars, and two soc-men, _i.e._, free tenants, on 75 acres; also 20\r\nacres of meadow, one fishery and a half, two mills, and 370 acres of\r\nwoodland, forming the “Tumby chase.”  He had also lands in Waddingworth\r\nand Wispington, which were within the jurisdiction of Kirkby; in the\r\nlatter two parishes he halved the land with the Bishop of Durham, who\r\nalso (as we have seen) had a slice of Kirkby.\r\n\r\nWith these several important personages connected with this parish, it\r\nnaturally also acquired a more important position than the villages\r\naround, justifying the term “town of Kirkby,” given to it in old records\r\n(Dugdale’s “Baronage” vol. i., p. 439).\r\n\r\nOf subsequent owners of Kirkby, and its appurtenances, Tumby, Fulsby, and\r\nToft, we are not able to give a connected series, but there is evidence\r\nenough to enable us to form fairly safe conjectures, concerning several\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nThe ownership of the de Lacys continued, with one brief interruption, for\r\nsome generations.  Hildebert was succeeded by his son Robert Henry, but\r\nhe, as Camden relates (“Britannia,” p. 712), taking part in the battle of\r\nTinchebray, Sep. 28, 1106, against Henry I., in favour of Robert, Duke of\r\nNormandy, on the victory of Henry, was deprived of his possessions, which\r\nwere given to another Norman, Henry Travers (Dugdale’s “Baronage” vol. i.\r\np. 99), and afterwards to Wido de Laval, who held them till the reign of\r\nStephen; when that King restored to the said Henry his possessions once\r\nmore.  His two sons Henry and Ilbert dying without issue, the estates in\r\n1193 passed to their half sister, on the mother’s side, Albreda de\r\nLisours.  She married Richard Fitzeustache, Constable of Chester; which\r\nfamily subsequently took the name of de Lacy, and (as has been already\r\nstated) became Earls of Lincoln.  The estates continued in this line till\r\n1310; when Henry de Lacy, having no male issue, left his property to his\r\ndaughter Alice, who married Thomas, Earl of Lancaster.  He joined a\r\nconspiracy against Edward II., and being defeated in the battle of\r\nBoroughbridge, in the West Riding of Yorkshire (March 16, 1322), was\r\nbeheaded on a hill near his Castle of Pontefract {106}; being, it is\r\nsaid, led out to the spot, by way of disgrace, “on a lean horse,” by an\r\nofficial, named Gasgoyne; which name also, somewhat curiously (as will be\r\nseen hereafter), is connected with Kirkby.  A change in ownership now\r\nappears; in the family of Bec, or Beke.  In the 13th century one of them\r\nWalter Bec was Constable of Lincoln Castle, under Henry de Lacy, Earl of\r\nLincoln, A.D., 1275 (“Hundred Rolls,” vol. i. p. 312).  But 80 years\r\nbefore this, a Final Concord, of 27 Nov. 1197, gives the following\r\nagreement, “on the 2nd day after the feast of St. Katharine” between\r\nWalter, son of Walter Bec, plaintiff, and Richard, Abbot of Kirkstead, as\r\nto a wood called Langhace, and other land “in the field of Kirkebi which\r\nis upon Bayne,” within the Court of the said Abbot, whereby Walter\r\n“quitclaims all his rights to the Abbot and Convent” for which they give\r\nhim 4 marks (£21 13_s._ 4_d_).\r\n\r\nBy another Concord, on the octave of St. Michael (Oct. 6, 1226), between\r\nWilliam Bec, plaintiff, and Henry, Abbot of Kirkstead, tenant of certain\r\nlands, in Kirkby, the Abbot acknowledges the lands to be “of the right of\r\nthe said William, which his father also had, to have and to hold (them)\r\nto him and his heirs for ever, of the Abbot, and his successors,\r\nrendering to them 6_d._ by the year, for all service”; and for this\r\nWilliam quitclaims all his rights to the Abbot, and his successors.\r\n\r\nAnother Concord (p. 220), shows that in 1227, Walter Bec had lands in\r\nKirkeby, Tattershale, and Thorpe, which he granted to Robert de\r\nTateshale; for which the latter was to “render £20 13_s._ 4_d._ yearly,\r\nat Kirkby upon Bayne, and to do the service of one knight” (“Architect S.\r\nJournal” xxiv. p. 34).\r\n\r\nBy another deed, in the same year, 1227, “three weeks from Easter day”\r\n(May 1st), between Walter Bec, plaintiff, and Robert de Tateshale,\r\ntouching right of warren on the lands of the said Walter, in Kirkby,\r\nTateshale, and Thorpe, concerning which Walter complained, that Robert\r\nunjustly, and without warrant, caused warren in the said lands, which\r\nrightly are of the fee of the Bishop of Durham, an agreement is made that\r\nRobert shall give an exchange of lands: whereupon Walter grants to Robert\r\n“all his lands in Kirkeby, Tateshale, and Thorpe, in demesnes, homages,\r\nrents, an services of free men, within the said manor, rendering £21\r\n13_s._ 4_d._, by the year, at Kirkeby on Bayne, and the service of one\r\nknight’s fee”; and for this Robert gives him 10 marks (£6 13_s._ 4_d._)\r\nThe head quarters of the Becs were at Lusby; Henry Bec, of Lusby, being\r\nfather of the Walter Bec, already named as Constable of Lincoln Castle.\r\nThey were strong in church influence; Thomas Bec, son of the said Walter\r\nBec, being Bishop of Lincoln, 1342–1346; while another Thomas Bec, a\r\ncousin, had been Bishop of St. David’s, 1280–1293; and another cousin,\r\nAnthony Bec, was Bishop of Durham, and so connected with Kirkby, as Lord\r\nSuperior, 1283–1310.\r\n\r\nIn a Harleyan charter (45 H. 12) in the British Museum we find the\r\nfollowing, “To all sons of Holy Church, Walter Bec, son of Henry Bec,\r\ngreeting.  Know that I have granted and quitclaimed to the monks of\r\nKirkstead, the manure of their 300 sheep of their fold of Kirkby.  Also I\r\nquitclaimed to the same the toll of my corn, which now they are\r\naccustomed to grind, according to the tenor of their charter &c.”\r\nWitnesses, Richard, Dean of Horncastr, Henry de Langton, Nicholas Bec,\r\nHenry Bec, and others.\r\n\r\nAnother name now appears among owners of Kirkby.  The Willoughbys and the\r\nBecs inter-married, and by a Feet of Fines (Lincoln file 68, 32; 30 Ed.\r\nI.)  Robert de Wilgeby grants to John Bec, for life only, certain lands\r\nin “Kirkeby next Bayne,” and 37 other parishes, with mills, advowson of\r\nbenefices, 9 fees of knights, &c.; after his decease the said properties\r\nto revert to the said Robert and his heirs, quit of the heirs of the said\r\nJohn.\r\n\r\nBy an inquisition _ad quod damnum_ (17 Ed. II., 1323), it was shewn that\r\nthis manor was charged with a payment of £21 13_s._ 4_d._ to John son and\r\nheir of this Robert de Wilgeby (Willoughby).\r\n\r\nSome of the Lords of Kirkby and Tumby seem to have treated the Abbots of\r\nKirkstead with considerable liberality; for which, doubtless, they would\r\nreceive an equivalent in prayers, if not “indulgences,” granted in their\r\nfavour.  In a cartulary of the Abbey (Vespasian, E., xviii.), now in the\r\nBritish Museum, is a charter running as follows:—“I, Robert, son of Simon\r\nde Tumby, have granted to the Church of St. Mary of Kirkstead half the\r\nfishery of Troholm, and 5 acres of land in the field of Tumby, and common\r\npasture through all the fields and territory within the bounds of Tumby.”\r\nThis was early in the 12th century.  The witnesses to this deed, it is to\r\nbe noticed, are his nephew Richard, and Gilbert, “clerk,” _i.e._, parson,\r\n“of Driebe”; hence we should infer that the “de Tumby” and “de Driby”\r\nfamilies were one and the same; and this is proved to have been the case\r\nby a Final Concord of 12 John (A.D. 1211), which mentions the above grant\r\nof “5 acres in Tumby” to Simon de Driby and his heirs. {108}  The grant\r\nto the Abbots of Kirkstead was confirmed, some years later, by Robert,\r\nson of Hugh de Tateshale, who “put his hand to the altar” in testimony of\r\nthe same (charter of same cartulary, quoted “Architect. Journ.,” xxiii.,\r\np. 107).\r\n\r\nBy a Chancery Inquisition p.m., 8 Ed. III. (1335), and by a similar\r\ndocument, 41 Ed. III., it is shown that John de Kirketon (Kirton) held\r\nfor life the manor of Tumby, with that of Tateshale.  The Kirktons of\r\nKirton, near Boston, were probably kinsmen of the Dribys, as this\r\ntransfer was made by John de Driby, and the Driby armorial bearings were\r\nformerly in the windows of Kirton Church, along with those of the Earls\r\nof Lincoln (connected, as we have seen, with Kirkby) and others\r\n(“Lincolnshire Churches,” by Stephen Lewin).  This local connection may,\r\nin aftertimes, have led to the marriage alliance of the D’Eyncourts, who\r\nheld the manor of Kirton, with the next family whom we shall mention, the\r\nCromwells. {109a}  The above Robert, son of Simon de Driby (or de Tumby),\r\nhad to wife Joan, co-heiress of the Barons of Tattershall; and somehow\r\nthat connection seems to have brought the Cromwells into possession of\r\nthe manor of Kirkby.  In an Inquisition p.m., 22 Rich. II. (1399), Ralph\r\nde Cromwell is described as owning the manor of Kirkby, with that of\r\nTattershall, through his wife Matilda, or Maud de Bernak, sister and sole\r\nheir of William de Bernak, Lord of Tattershall.  He had lands in 14\r\nparishes in this county, 1 in Derbyshire, and 6 in Notts. {109b}  His\r\ngrandson, Ralph, married Margaret, sister and co-heir of the 5th and last\r\nBaron D’Eyncourt.  His granddaughter, Maud, married Sir Richard Stanhope,\r\nof Rampton, knight.  Their daughter, Maud, married Sir Gervase Clifton,\r\nof Clifton, knight, “The gentle Sir Gervase,” who was killed at the\r\nbattle of Tewkesbury, May 4, 1471; and afterwards married Sir Thomas\r\nNeville, and then the 6th Baron Willoughby d’ Eresby.  Thus we have a\r\nnumber of important alliances of this family of Kirkby proprietors\r\n(“Architect. S. Journal,” 1858, p. 228).\r\n\r\nAt the time when Gervase Holles, in 1630, made his peregrinations round\r\nthis county, he says that there were in the windows of the rectory house,\r\nof Kirkby, the armorial bearings, in coloured glass, of some 20 leading\r\ncounty families, including—Becs, Willoughbys, Percys, Tyrwhitts,\r\nTailbois, Dymokes, &c.  These had probably been originally in the windows\r\nof the church, and, on the decay of the edifice, had been transferred to\r\nthe house.  Representations of these are given in the Harleyan MS.\r\n(6829), now in the British Museum, together with a description of\r\nmonuments formerly in the church, but now lost.  These arms enable us to\r\nform an idea of the great families who were connected with this parish.\r\nThe association with the place of the Tailbois is not quite clear; but\r\nGilbert Tailbois was summoned to Parliament, as Baron Tailbois, in the\r\nreign of Henry VIII., when he showed that he was descended from Sir\r\nEdward Dymoke, who married Anne Tailbois.  This Gilbert was also\r\ndescended from Henry Tailbois, who married Eleanor Burdon, daughter of\r\nGilbert Burdon, by Elizabeth de Umfraville, sister and heiress of the\r\nEarl of Angus (“Dugdale’s Baronage,” vol. i.); who again was related to\r\nthe de Kymes, kinsmen of the Dymokes; the Kymes also being connected with\r\nthe old and distinguished county family of the Ayscoughs.\r\n\r\nThe connection of the Dymokes with Kirkby is seen in the following\r\nbequest of “Arthur Dymmocke of Toft Grange, in the p’she of Kyrkebye,” of\r\ndate May 27, A.D., 1558.  “I geve and bequeathe to the Church of the said\r\nKyrkebye one satteyn gown, to make a coope or a vestment.  I will that\r\nthere shall be distributed among the poore people at my buriall xiiili.\r\nxiis. viii.  I give to the poore people of the towneshipp of Kirkebye\r\nvili., to the poore of Tunbye xls.”  There are also bequests to “Marum,\r\nWillesby, Screuelby, Roughton, Connyngesbye, Tattershall, Haltam,” &c.\r\nHe adds, “I will that myne executour shall geve to the marriages of poore\r\nmaydens, at their discretions, xxvjli.  I geve to the repayring of fowle\r\nand noysome hie wayes xxvjli.  I geve to my brother Sir Edwarde Dymmocke,\r\nKnight, tenne pound, and my best gelding, with the best jewell he will\r\nchuse among all my jewells.  I geve to my sister his wif one gold ring wt\r\na turkey (turquoise).  I geve to Sir {111} Thomas Olive, p’sonne of\r\nKirkebye one gold ring enamelled.”  These, and many more bequests to poor\r\npeople in the county of Middlesex, &c., &c., show that Arthur Dymoke of\r\nToft Grange, was a man of substance, as well as of generous mind.\r\n(“Linc. N. & Q.” July 1897, vol. v., No. 39).\r\n\r\nWe now get another family resident in this parish, of some importance.\r\nWe have mentioned Fulsby Hall, of which nothing certain now remains.\r\nThis demesne would seem to have belonged to the Nelthorpes of Scawby, N.\r\nLincolnshire, but it was occupied by a family named Cressy.  The Cressy\r\npedigree is given in a MS. book of “Lincolnshire Gentry,” written by\r\nThomas Beckwith, F.S.A., 1768, and preserved in the Library of Revesby\r\nAbbey (“Linc. N. & Q.” vol. ii., p. 166).  As far back as A.D., 1216, we\r\nfind a William de Cressy named, along with Ralph de Haya (an old Norman\r\nfamily), as being “sureties for the faithful service” of Simon de Driby,\r\nalready named.  (Hardy’s “Rolls de oblatis et finibus,” p. 575.)  Whether\r\nhe was of the same family we cannot say, but it is some hundreds of years\r\nbefore the name occurs again.\r\n\r\nAlso a charter of Hamelin, Count de Warren, and his Countess Isabella,\r\nabout A.D., 1074, mentions a Roger de Cressy, with whom they unite in\r\ngranting a wood, and other properties, “to God and the Church of St.\r\nVictor, and the Monks thereof,” in Normandy.  The same charter also names\r\n3 houses given by Ranulph de Cressy, “for the soul of his brother Hugh,”\r\n(“Archæological Journal,” No. 9, 1846.)  Thomas Cressy, of Fulsby, is\r\nnamed among the Gentry of Lincolnshire in the “Herald’s Visitation” of\r\n1634, preserved in the Library of the Herald’s College.  Canon Maddison\r\nin a note to his “Lincolnshire Wills” (p. 141) says that Nicholas Cressy\r\nmarried Frances, daughter of Sir Henry Ayscough, Knight of Blyborough,\r\nand left Blyborough for Kirkby-on-Bain, _i.e._, for Toft Grange.  The\r\ndaughter, Faith, of this Nicholas Cressy, married George Tyrwhitt, a\r\ncadet of the Kettleby family of Tyrwhitts; and we have already seen that\r\nthe Tyrwhitt arms were among those formerly in the Rectory windows.  Her\r\nsister Jane married Sir Edward Dymoke, Knight, of Scrivelsby.  Her eldest\r\nbrother was named Brandon, from the connection of the Ayscoughs, with\r\nCharles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk.  This Faith had a daughter named\r\n“Douglas”; the Tyrwhitts being related to the Sheffields, and John, 2nd\r\nLord Sheffield married Douglas, daughter of William, 1st Lord Howard of\r\nEffingham.  His son, again, Edmund, created Earl of Mulgrave, married\r\nabout 1590, Ursula, daughter of Sir Robert Tyrwhitt of Kettleby.  Faith\r\nTyrwhitt, by will, dated 18 Feby, 1669, leaves bequests to Lady Jane\r\nDymoke, to her brother Major Thomas Cressy, to Edward and Charles Dymoke,\r\nto Elizabeth Dymoke, her goddaughter; and “to my good child Douglas\r\neverything else.”  This “Douglas” was baptized at Horncastle, 8 January,\r\n1628–9.\r\n\r\nThere is some difficulty in connecting the Percy family with Kirkby,\r\nbeyond the fact that their arms were among those in the rectory windows.\r\nBut a Chancery Inquisition post mortem of 1381–2 (5 Richard II., No. 47),\r\nshows that Mary de Percy, wife of John de Roos, was next heir to\r\nMargaret, wife of John de Orby, who was jointly enfeoffed of certain\r\nlands in Tattershall, &c.; and that on her decease the Earl of\r\nNorthumberland (a Percy) held and occupied the same, he having married\r\ntheir daughter Joan, as second wife.  The above John de Orby is stated to\r\nhave been kinsman and heir of Robert de Tateshale, knight.  These lands\r\nwere also held of the Duke of Lancaster, a Gaunt.  (“Linc. N. & Q.” vol.\r\nvi., No. 47, p. 73).  We further find that after the death of Gilbert de\r\nGaunt, his widow the Countess Roheis, in her own right married one\r\n“Robertus, Dapifer” who was steward to the house of Percy (“Topographist\r\nand Genealogist” i., 303).  If this was, as seems likely, a Robert de\r\nTateshale, he would be a landowner in Tumby, and, as steward, also a\r\nvassal of the Percys, Earls of Northumberland.  As further connecting the\r\nPercy family with this neighbourhood, we may mention, that among the\r\nRevesby charters, is one of date about 1142, the witnesses to which are\r\nHenry de Perci, Gilbert de Bec, and others.  The same Henry de Perci is\r\nalso witness to another of these charters, of date 1155.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Willoughbys have been already mentioned as among those\r\nformerly in the Rectory.  This may be accounted for by the fact that\r\nMatilda, or Maud, Lady Willoughby, widow of Lord Cromwell, died in 1497,\r\nseized of a greater part of the possessions of her late husband, and,\r\namong others, “in fee tail of the manor of Kyrkeby upon Bayne” (“Chancery\r\nInquisition” p.m., 13, Henry vii., No. 34.  Quoted “Architect S. Journal”\r\nxxiii. p. 132.)\r\n\r\nWe have now shown links connecting this parish, more or less closely,\r\nwith most of the families whose armorial bearings formerly existed here.\r\nThere is only one more name not yet accounted for: that of Gasgoyne.  We\r\nare unable positively to establish any link in this case.  Camden tells\r\nus (“Britannia,” pp. 714–731), that the Gasgoynes were an “ancient and\r\nvirtuous family of Yorkshire, seated at Gawthorpe, probably (he says)\r\nfrom Gasgoyne in France,” to which family belonged the famous Judge, Sir\r\nWilliam Gasgoyne, who showed his courage by committing to prison the\r\nyoung Prince, who was to be the future King Henry V.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned that the property of the de Lacys (including,\r\nprobably, Kirkby) passed to Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, who was afterwards\r\nbeheaded for rebellion, being led out for execution by an officer named\r\nGasgoyne.  It would appear, therefore, that a Gasgoyne held some official\r\npost at Pontefract Castle, and that Lordship (as we have seen), was\r\nconnected with Kirkby, as belonging to the same noble owners, de Lacys,\r\nand others; and hence the Gasgoyne arms appear along with those of the de\r\nLacys, and others.  The name of Gasgoyne is found in Stow’s copy of the\r\nroll of Battle Abbey, as among the distinguished soldiers who came over\r\nwith the Conqueror, coupled with Gaunt, Gaunville, and many another good\r\nname.\r\n\r\nAt the dissolution of religious houses by Henry VIII., we find among\r\ninstitutions to benefices, that Robert Brantingham, was presented to\r\nKirkby, in 1565, by Robert Brantingham, of Horncastle, by reason of the\r\nadvowson, for that turn, being granted to him by “the late Prior and\r\nConvent of the Cathedral Church of Durham.”  And so ended the connection\r\nof Kirkby with the See of the proud Bishops of Durham.  On the extinction\r\nof the Cromwell line these lands, in Tattershall, Tattershall Thorpe,\r\nKirkby, &c., would revert to the King.  Henry VIII. granted Tattershall,\r\nand doubtless the other possessions, to his mother Margaret, Countess of\r\nRichmond; and in the following year entailed them on the Duke.  On the\r\nlatter dying without issue, Henry granted a vast number of estates in\r\nthis, and other localities, to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk.  On the\r\ndeath of two infant sons of the Duke, shortly after their father’s\r\ndecease, Edward VI. granted them to Edward, Lord Clinton, whose arms were\r\nalso among those formerly in the rectory windows.  His descendant Edward\r\nEarl of Lincoln, died without issue in 1692, when the properties passed\r\nto his cousin Bridget, who married Hugh Fortescue, Esq.; whose son was\r\ncreated Baron Fortescue, and Earl of Lincoln in 1740; and a large portion\r\nof Kirkby is still the property of Lord Fortescue, who is Lord of the\r\nManor, other owners being the Clinton, Wilson, Ashton, Lely families,\r\nLockwood trustees, &c.\r\n\r\nBy a similar process the lands formerly held by the Monks of Revesby,\r\nwere granted, on the dissolution, by Henry VIII. to his “well beloved and\r\ndear kinsman,” the aforesaid Duke of Suffolk, Charles Brandon.  Among\r\nthese are named lands in Tumby, Fulsby, Kirkby-on-Bain, &c., &c.  From\r\nthe Brandons they passed to the great Lord Treasurer Burleigh, and then\r\nto the Howards; then to the family of Sir Joseph Banks; and he, dying\r\nwithout issue, left his estates divided among the families of Stanhope,\r\nSir H. Hawley, Bart., and Sir Edward Knatchbull, Bart.  The present Sir\r\nHenry M. Hawley, of Leybourne, Maidstone, Kent, is lord of the manor of\r\nTumby, including Fulsby, and resides at Tumby Lawn.  Some of the land\r\nbelongs to the representatives of the late Right Honourable E. Stanhope,\r\nH. Rogers, Esq., and smaller proprietors.  The Fulsby Hall Farm, with the\r\nwatermill, was given in 1669 to the Grammar School at Brigg, by Sir John\r\nNelthorpe, the then proprietor; but most of this has been purchased in\r\nlate years by Sir Henry James Hawley; so that there now only remain some\r\n70 acres, and the Fulsby watermill, connected with that school.\r\n\r\nJust outside the parish to the south-east is a large wood, now called\r\n“Shire Wood”; but in a Revesby charter (No. 29), date Henry II., the name\r\nis given as “Skire-wode”; which is Danish, connected with our words\r\n“shear” to cut, and “shire” a division, and means the “boundary,” or\r\n“dividing” wood.  The same syllable occurs in the “Skir-beck” quarter of\r\nBoston.  In a smaller wood, in the west of the parish, called “Kirkby\r\nRiddings” we have another relic of the Danes, as Mr. Streatfeild, in his\r\nwork “Lincolnshire and the Danes,” tells us, that in their language\r\n“ridja” means to “clear away a wood.”  We still speak of “ridding\r\nourselves” of anything, when we clear it away.  The Kirkby Riddings,\r\ndoubtless tell of the “clearings” in those larger woods which we have\r\nalready mentioned as formerly existing here, wherein the Lords of the\r\ndemesne found their sport in the chase of the deer, the wild boar, and\r\nother animals. {115a}  Those “hardy Norsemen” were a tough race, and have\r\nthus left their traces behind them.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned an Ayscough in connection with Kirkby; a daughter of\r\nSir Henry Ayscough having married Nicholas Cressy of Fulsby Hall.  This\r\nwas a very old family, originally located in Yorkshire; the name having\r\nprobably been Akes-heugh, or Ake-shaw, _i.e._, Oak-wood; it afterwards\r\ncame to be spelt in a variety of ways, as Ayscough, Ayscoghe, Aiscough,\r\nAskew, &c.\r\n\r\nThey claimed descent from a Saxon thane, Thurstan “de Bosco,” and\r\n“boscus” is Latin for “wood,” or “coppice.”  This confirms the above\r\nmeaning.  The heraldic device of the family was “three asses coughing”\r\n(Guillim’s “Heraldry,” 1794), and the name, in some of their branches, is\r\nstill pronounced like Ass-_coff_ and not Ass-coe.  They have been\r\ndistinguished in church, court, and camp, acquiring large property in\r\nLincolnshire, and allying themselves with some of our oldest families,\r\nthe Tailbois, Brandons, Hilyards, St. Pauls, Kymes, Clintons, Heneages,\r\nFoljambes, Saviles, Boucheretts, &c.  They gave to this county, what the\r\ncounty may well be proud of, Anne Askew, who died at the stake, a Martyr\r\nfor the Protestant faith, at Smithfield, 16 July, 1546. {115b}  A Walter\r\nAscoughe, and Henry his son, are named among those who succeeded to parts\r\nof the former Revesby Abbey estates, when the Duke of Suffolk’s family\r\nbecame extinct.  (Dugdale’s “Baronage” ii., 300).  And this family is\r\nstill established in various parts of the kingdom, the name surviving in\r\nall ranks of life.  Few families are without their humbler connections.\r\nFor instance, in the case of the parish with which we are now concerned,\r\nwe find in its former records a “Robert de Tumbi” who was a Bec, or a\r\nBernak, or a Cromwell, lord of many a manor, and also a “William de\r\nTumbi” who was a bondman of John Bec, lord of the manor, whose “body and\r\nchattels,” the said John reserves to himself, while giving the land on\r\nwhich the said William labours, to the Abbey of Kirkstead.  (Charter of\r\nJohn Bec. Harley, MS. 45, H. 13).\r\n\r\nSo in modern times, the late lord of the manor of Tumby, Sir Henry James\r\nHawley, Bart., married, as his first wife, Miss Elizabeth Askew, in the\r\nsouth of England, while, in a humbler sphere in life, we find a small\r\nfarmer, in the person of Mr. Thomas Askew, residing in Kirkby-on-Bain; an\r\nillustration in a new sense of Shakespeare’s saying, “a touch of nature\r\nmakes the world akin” (“Troilus and Cressida” act. iii., sc. iii.)\r\n\r\nAs these notes have now reached a considerable length, we will briefly\r\nnotice the Church of St. Mary, at Kirkby; and indeed, it barely deserves\r\nmore than a brief notice, as it has no claims to architectural beauty.\r\n\r\nWe may well suppose, that, as at that other Kirkby, now known as\r\nPontefract, a fine church was once a feature of the locality, so it was\r\nonce the same here; but this is no longer the case.  If those armorial\r\nbearings which Gervase Holles saw in the rectory 250 years ago, were\r\noriginally in the church, as would seem probable, they would doubtless\r\nembellish a fabric of some size and beauty.  We can hardly imagine, that\r\nthe benefice, under the patronage of rich prelates like the Bishop of\r\nDurham, in a parish also connected with important monasteries like those\r\nof Kirkstead and Revesby, having also powerful landowners such as the\r\nBecs, Willoughbys, Cromwells, and other “Lords of Tattershall” (where so\r\nfine a collegiate church was provided by them), would have been left with\r\nan unworthy church here.  But whatever may have been its former merits,\r\nof these there are no longer any traces.  On the south side lies the\r\nsquare base of a churchyard cross, shorn of its shaft, probably by the\r\nreckless Puritans, who may also have demolished, as they often did, the\r\nfine stained-glass windows, of which the armorial bearings, once in the\r\nrectory, may likely enough have been remnants.  Gervase Holles mentions\r\ntwo monuments which were in the church in his time.  Of these one was in\r\nthe chancel, having a quaint Latin inscription to the following effect:—\r\n\r\n    Richard Lambard lies by this stone entombed;\r\n    Of this Church formerly Rector was he.\r\n    Who caused this Chancel to be newly built.\r\n    He presented a Missal, and other valuables.\r\n    On the 14th day of January he sought the stars,\r\n    In the 1450th year of our Lord.\r\n    To whom God grant eternal rest!  Amen.\r\n\r\nOn a flat slab, beside the above, was the following, also in Latin:—\r\n\r\n    William Bulliar lies here entombed;\r\n    Of this church formerly Rector was he;\r\n    He caused a new Crucifix to be erected.\r\n    He presented a gradual {117a} and cross, and other valuables.\r\n    He died the 11th day of December, 1510.\r\n\r\nThere was also apparently a window to his memory.\r\n\r\nOf a later Church, in a state of ruin, there was given an engraving in\r\nthe “Gentleman’s Magazine” of August 11, 1801, with brief account of the\r\nchurch; a copy of which is in the possession of the present rector, the\r\nRev. R. Gathorne, M.A.; framed, in his study. {117b}  In that later\r\nedifice, the pulpit is said to have been a massive one, of stone.  But\r\nthis, like the monuments given above, has disappeared.  Of the present\r\nchurch, built in 1802, the best we can say is that it is in the style\r\ncalled “Debased Gothic.”  The late rector, the Rev. C. F. R. Baylay,\r\nrural dean, &c., put stone mullions, in place of wood, in the windows, in\r\n1879; when the late bishop, Dr. Christopher Wordsworth, performed the\r\nceremony of re-opening the church on November 6th, as is recorded on a\r\nbrass tablet on the north wall of the nave.  The church was, at the same\r\ntime, re-seated with open sittings of pitch-pine.  The western gallery\r\nwas also then removed.  Over the west door is a good painting of the\r\nroyal arms, of date 1712, with initials “A.R.”  (Anne Regina).  There is\r\na slab in the pavement of the nave at its east end, in memory of Rev. T.\r\nRoe, formerly rector.  The font is plain octagonal.  The ceiling is flat,\r\nof polished pitch-pine.  There are three plain windows in the south wall\r\nof the nave, and two in the north wall.  The chancel is apsidal, with a\r\nthree-light window in the centre, and a small single-light window on each\r\nside.  The chancel arch is unusually low, and broad, out of proportion.\r\nThe only handsome thing in the church is the communion table, which is of\r\nold oak, probably of the Caroline period, massive, and richly carved,\r\nhaving a curious cupboard below the upper slab.  It is, however, more fit\r\nto be a chiffonier or dining room sideboard, than for its present use.\r\nThe church has accommodation for 212, which is amply sufficient, as the\r\nonce “Town” of Kirkby has been decreasing in population for many years.\r\nThe one bell hangs in an external small turret.  The registers date from\r\n1562.\r\n\r\nThe present rectory is a commodious residence, built in 1827, at a cost\r\nof £1,800.  It stands in almost park-like grounds, with fine timber.  The\r\nvillage school was rebuilt in 1870, with residence for the teacher, and\r\nwas endowed by Richard Brocklesby with 33 acres of land in the parish of\r\nBicker.  The poor have an interest in the almshouses of Sir Joseph Banks\r\nat Reyesby; also a yearly dole of 5_s._, left by Martha Chamberlain.\r\n\r\nThe poet Dyer, who was appointed rector of Coningsby, by Sir John\r\nHeathcote in 1752, became rector of Kirkby in 1755, but presently\r\nexchanged it for Belchford.  He was the author of “Grongar Hill,” “The\r\nFleece,” and other poems of some merit, and was honoured in a\r\ncomplimentary sonnet by Wordsworth, the Laureate.\r\n\r\nAnother rector, the Rev. Willoughby West, extended his charity beyond his\r\nown parish, since by will dated 30 January, 1690, he founded two\r\nalmshouses, for deserving poor persons, in the parish of\r\nLangton-by-Horncastle, (he being one of the patrons of the benefice),\r\nendowed with the rent of land purchased by him “from Geo. Langto of\r\nLangto, Esq.”  His burial is registered at Kirkby, 29 May, 1691, and that\r\nof his wife, Mary Ester, “April ye 8th, 1690.”\r\n\r\nAt “Leeds Gate,” to the south of this parish, in Coningsby, are two\r\nfields, named “Gibbet close,” and “Gibbet nook close,” where probably\r\nsome offenders formerly expiated their misdeeds, under the stern hand of\r\nthe lord of the manor. {119}  The name “Leeds gate,” given in old maps as\r\n“Lidyate,” is probably a corruption of “Our Lady’s gate” (_i.e._ road);\r\nthere having been formerly a “Guild of the Virgin Mary,” connected with\r\nConingsby church.  There are also two fields called “Over Coney Green,”\r\nand “Low Coney Green,” which may have reference to the rabbit warren of\r\nTumby Chase, or to “the King’s Garth,” or inclosure, “Conig,” _i.e._\r\nKing, also forming part of the name Coningsby.  These field-names are\r\nfound in several other parishes.  There are fields called “Otter Close,”\r\n“Best Moor,” and “Worst Moor,” the not uncommon “Pingle” (or small\r\ncroft), “North Ings,” and “Tumby Ings,” these meaning well-watered\r\nmeadows.  Another name, not easy to explain, though not uncommon, is\r\n“Pry-close.”  It occurs also in Woodhall and elsewhere.  One\r\ninterpretation which has been suggested is that it may have marked the\r\nplace where watch was kept for game, or game-marauders, or like\r\n“Toot-hill,” also found in the vicinity, it may have been a look-out for\r\ncattle, strayed in the time of Fen floods.  But another suggestion is\r\nthat it is a form of the old Norman “Pre,” a meadow, praie being a kind\r\nof coarse grass.  Near Northampton, there are “the verdant meads of de la\r\nPre,” and in Normandy there was a monastery of “De la Pre de Rouen,”\r\nattached to the abbey of Bec, and the Norman Becs (as we have seen) were\r\nconnected with Kirkby and Tumby.  There is a “Pry-farm,” in Wiltshire.\r\nWhat is now only Fulsby mill, in this parish, was formerly and within\r\nliving memory also, a public-house, rejoicing in the name of “The Jolly\r\nSailor.”  Here, after the murder of Stennet Jeffery, in “the Wilderness”\r\nof Whitehall Wood, on June 22, 1822, the murderers, who belonged to\r\nConingsby Moor, stopped for refreshment.  They were said to be “bankers,”\r\n_i.e._ navvies, whose chief employment was digging drains, repairing\r\ntheir banks, &c.; while employed on the Horncastle canal near at hand,\r\nthey had doubtless frequented the house before.  They were usually rough\r\nand even violent characters, and it is said that Mrs. Copping, the\r\nlandlady of the Inn, was aware of their guilt, but too much afraid of\r\nthem to mention it.  After their visit, some blood-stained clothing was\r\nfound concealed in a hedge hard by.  Two of these men were convicted of\r\nthe murder and transported for life.  (See “Records of Woodhall Spa,” by\r\nJ. Conway Walter, pp. 16, 17.)\r\n\r\nGeologically, Kirkby has some interest; parts of the parish are on the\r\nblue clay, with ammonites and other fossils, while there is also a\r\nstratum of fine gravel, termed the “Bain terraces,” in which teeth of the\r\n“elephas primi-genius” have been found.  (“Government Geolog. Survey,”\r\nLincoln, 1888, pp. 161, &c.)\r\n\r\nTo the ornithologist and entomologist its interest would seem to be\r\nincreasing.  The abandonment of the Horncastle canal, which runs through\r\nthis parish, is making it a sort of sanctuary where the coot, the\r\nmoorhen, the dab-chick, and the mallard resort; the green sand-piper may\r\nbe seen, skimming the water, or the king-fisher darting into the\r\nshallows, and the heron, which nests in the adjacent woods, stands like a\r\nsilent sentinel on one leg, by its pools, on the watch for its finny\r\nprey.  On the reedy banks of the fast silting-up canal, it would hardly\r\nbe surprising if that rarity among butterflies, the swallow-tail, which\r\nover-drainage has driven from its former haunts, should once more\r\nre-appear.  But we have said enough about Kirkby, and more than exceeded\r\nthe measure of space allowed us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKIRKBY, EAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nEast Kirkby is situated just below the steep slope of the Wolds, near\r\ntheir southern extremity, between 7 and 8 miles south south-east of\r\nHorncastle, 6 miles south-west from Spilsby, and 9 miles north-east from\r\nTattershall.  From Horncastle it is approached _viâ_ Scrivelsby and\r\nMoorby.  It is contiguous, on the east, to Revesby.\r\n\r\nThis in one of the 220 odd parishes in the county which possessed a\r\nchurch before the Norman Conquest.  At that period it seems to have been\r\nunited with Revesby, since in Domesday Book (1080–86) “Cherchebi” and\r\n“Resuesbi” are given together, and it is stated that “the whole manor and\r\nall that belongs thereto is six miles long, and six miles broad.”  There\r\nare 12 carucates (or 1440 acres) rateable to gelt (_i.e._, 2_s._ to the\r\ncarucate); and the same extent of arable land (or 2,880 acres in all);\r\nwith (in Saxon times), 54 socmen, and 14 villeins.  The great Norman\r\nNoble, Ivo Taillebois, Chief of the Angevine troops of the Conqueror, was\r\nlord of this manor, through his marriage with the wealthy Saxon, Lady\r\nLucia, heiress of the Thorolds.  On his death early in life—a death not\r\nregretted by her, for the marriage had been forced upon her by the\r\nConqueror—she re-married, with hardly a decent delay, Roger de Romara,\r\nabout 1093; and by him had a son, William de Romara, who was created Earl\r\nof Lincoln.  This William founded Revesby Abbey in 1142, and, by an\r\ninterchange of lands, while retaining Revesby, Moorby, Wilksby, &c., as a\r\ncompact property, he separated East Kirkby as a distinct domain.  Among\r\nthose with whom exchanges were effected was one Ivo, a priest, who held a\r\nchurch at Thoresby, probably standing on the site of the present Revesby\r\nchurch.  In lieu of this, the Earl gave to Ivo the church of East Kirkby\r\nwith its appurtenances, and a toft near the churchyard.  In the 13th\r\ncentury, the family of de la Launde (represented, down to recent times,\r\nby the Kings, of Ashby de la Laund, near Sleaford) were manorial lords\r\n{121} of East Kirkby, while the Earls of Exeter (as shewn in Notes on\r\nRevesby, &c.) had the manor of Thoresby and Revesby, &c.  East Kirkby, as\r\nwell as Revesby, was in the soke of Old Bolingbroke, and, as parts of the\r\nDuchy of Lancaster, the Sovereign would be the superior lord of the\r\nvarious manors in that soke, or “Honour,” as it was named, as being\r\nconnected with royalty.  Accordingly, in 1604, we find that Sir V.\r\nSkinner, of Bolingbroke, was appointed by the crown keeper of Kirkby\r\nPark, the site of which is still shown on old maps; and, according to\r\n“Liber Regis,” in 1762 the Sovereign presented to the benefice, although,\r\nby some arrangement, William Ellis, Esq., had presented in 1719.  The\r\nmanor now belongs to R. Maidens, Esq., and Dr. T. Robinson, but most of\r\nthe soil belongs to the Stanhope or Coltman families, the patronage of\r\nthe benefice being in the hands of the former.\r\n\r\nAmong the Revesby charters and deeds, printed by the late Rt. Hon. E.\r\nStanhope, is one (No. 27) of Alan Smerehorn, of East Kirkby, dated 1165,\r\nby which he gives a watermill and premises to the Abbots of Revesby, with\r\nthe right to draw water through his land, from Bolingbroke to Kirkby; the\r\nAbbey thus being supplied with water. {122}  He also, by another deed\r\n(No. 28), conveys to the Abbey his rights in certain lands in Kirkby,\r\nundertaking all claims and services due to the King, in return for which\r\nthe Revesby Monks confirm to him certain rights in Hagnaby.\r\n\r\nBy a deed of the same period, Alan, son of Walter of Kirkby, gives his\r\nfeudal rights, in certain lands in Kirkby, to the monks, with lands in\r\nHagnaby and Engcroft in Stickford, free of all claims from the King.\r\n\r\nA charter of Richard I. (“Dugdale,” v. 456) confirms to the Monks of\r\nRevesby, among other possessions, 620 acres of land in E. Kirkby, and\r\npart of Kirkby Wood, along the road called “Swinistigate” (No. 40 B).\r\nN.B.—There is still a Swinecote in Revesby.  Various other deeds assign\r\nto the monks lands given by William son of Ivo, of Kirkby (No. 43); by\r\nAlan son of Walter of Kirkby (No. 45); by Lucy widow of Walter Faber, of\r\nKirkby (a “Smith?”) a meadow, “to decorate and strew the monk’s choir.”\r\n(No. 56).  While Henry Smerehorn gives to them his “servant Robert, son\r\nof Colsvan, with all his chattels” (No. 53); and Alan Smerehorn, of\r\nKirkby, gives a plot “ad portam josep.” (at the Joseph gate), among\r\nseveral others, taking on himself all claims to the king or others (No.\r\n58).  The seal of Smerehorn is a round one with the device, a man blowing\r\na horn.  Gaufrid, son of Alan Buche, of Kirkby, gives land in E. Kirkby\r\nspecially as “gate alms” for the poor (No. 68); the same Gaufrid also\r\nconfirming the gift made by his brother Walter, of a meadow in Goutscroft\r\n(No. 70).  N.B.—“Gout,” or, writ fully, “go-out,” means a spring issuing\r\nfrom a hill side, of which there are many on the Wold slopes\r\n(Streatfeild, “Lincolnshire and the Danes,” p. 174). {123a}  Alan de\r\nCuilter, of Kirkby, among other lands, gives a place (placeam) called\r\n“gayres” (No. 101); gaire meaning a triangular plot which requires\r\nploughing a different way to the rest of the ground. {123b}  A meadow in\r\nKirkby is given by Nicholas son of Roger, of Miningsby, towards\r\nmaintaining “the light before the image of St. Nicholas in Kirkby Church,\r\nevery St. Nicholas’ day.” (No. 119).\r\n\r\nThere are other deeds connected with East Kirkby, but these are typical.\r\n\r\nWe give here some other records connected with East Kirkby, which are of\r\nmore or less interest, taken from “Lincolnshire Wills.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Saltfletby, alias Massenge {123c} of “Kirkby juxta Bolingbroke,”\r\nby his will, dated 3 January, 1443, requests that he may be buried in\r\nKirkby Church; and leaves money to the church, as well as to the Church\r\nof St. Peter in Eastgate, Lincoln; also to his daughter, his wife, and\r\nher daughter, certain lands in Kirkby, Miningsby, and West Kele; and his\r\nhouse opposite the Church of St. Peter, Eastgate, “called the Gryffin.”\r\nThe witnesses are Robt. Drydyke, Vicar of Kirkby (N.B.—The place-name\r\nDrysykes occurs in Salmonby); John Cokeryll, chaplain of the same; and\r\nHugh Wellys, clerk.\r\n\r\nRichard Skepper, of East Kirkby, by will dated 26 May, 1556, requests to\r\nbe buried in the church; and leaves to his sons, Thomas, George, and\r\nEdward, and daughters, Bridget and Anne, his copyholds in Kirkby,\r\nMiningsby, Bolingbroke, Waynflete, Irby, Thorpe, and Friskney.  N.B.—This\r\nwas a family from Durham.\r\n\r\nJohn Ballet, parson of Nether Toynton, by his will, of 17 April, 1558,\r\nleaves his “gown, that the Bishop of Ely gave him,” to Mr. Goodryke, of\r\nKirkby {123d} and a gold ring; he also leaves money to repair the roads\r\nbetween Fulletby and Horncastle.\r\n\r\nConnected with the Goodricks, by marriage, were the Littleburies,\r\ndescended as is shown elsewhere {124a} from a very ancient knightly\r\nfamily, originally seated in south Lincolnshire, and hence we find the\r\nfollowing will of Humphrey Littlebury, of East Kirkby, dated 1 Sep.,\r\n1568, by which he leaves all his lands in Hagworthingham to his son John,\r\nwho is to pay to his brother Edward xxli a year “for his _exhibition_,”\r\n{124b} during the widow’s lifetime; the annuity to cease when the said\r\nEdward becomes a “counsaler,” and able to provide for himself.  He\r\nbequeaths his lands in Hareby, East Keal, Keal Cotes, and Raithby, to his\r\ndaughter Ann, “if she will be ordered by her friends, Sir John Kersey and\r\nJohn Littlebury,” and if she will not, then “never a penny.”  It would\r\nrather appear, from this testamentary provision, that the said daughter\r\nAnn was somewhat of a wilful “hussy.”  Sir John Kersey would be one of\r\nthe family who came in for a share of the Revesby estates after the\r\nextinction of the direct line of the Dukes of Suffolk.  To his daughter\r\nDorothy he leaves “one hundred marks” with a like proviso.  To his son\r\nJohn he leaves a “ring with the seal,” _i.e._, the family signet; also\r\n“one silver salt, vi. silver spoons, 1 silver goblet, gilt, a flat silver\r\npiece, and 1 of my silver pots I bought in London.”  Reference is then\r\nmade to an Inventory of Lyon Goodricke, deceased, which was bequeathed to\r\ntestator’s wife, Winifred, and Edward Goodricke, her son.  The testator\r\nhad married (1) Ursula, co-heir of Sir John Kersey, knt., of Grove, co.\r\nNotts, and (2) Winifred, daughter of Henry Sapcote {125a} of Lincoln, and\r\nwidow of Lyon Goodricke, of East Kirkby.\r\n\r\nWe have noticed, above, a Richard Skepper, of East Kirkby, whose will was\r\ndated 26 May, 1556.  We find later, the will of George Skeeper, of\r\nBoston, evidently the same name, of date 28 Sep., 1606, in which he\r\ndesires to be buried “in ye parish church of East Kirkby.”  The name\r\nstill survives in this neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nAnother name still occupying a position in the county is that of Booth,\r\nand we find that William Booth, of East Kirkby, by will dated 31 Oct.,\r\n1584, left property to his brother George’s children in Cheshire, to his\r\nbrother Edward’s children, of Rand, to George Booth of Thorpe, and to\r\nThomas Booth, his brother’s son; appointing as his executors, Sir Thomas\r\nScales and John Scales, his sons-in-law.\r\n\r\nWe have named, above, Edward Goodrick, of East Kirkby.  He died in 1615,\r\nand by his will, of 16 August in that year, he left the bulk of his\r\nproperty to his son Lyon, but £35 from lands in Suffolk to his daughter\r\nWashbourne, besides £400, in the hands of Sir Thomas Jenney, as her\r\nportion; “a best bed” to another daughter; and “bedsteads of those in\r\nSuffolk,” to four other daughters, all married, “2 Jacobuses to each as a\r\ntoken of my love.”  Small sums are bequeathed to his cousin, Richard\r\nPalfreyman, {125b} and his godson, Nathaniel Palfreyman; to his servant\r\nJohn Tupholme 20s. besides his wages 13s. 4d.  His “grandson John\r\nGodricke to have the manor of Stickney when 22 years old,” and his cousin\r\nRichard Palfreyman to have it meanwhile; paying “a penny a year to Lyon\r\nGodricke.”  The will was proved at Horncastle by Lyon Goodrick and\r\nRichard Palfreyman, 25 Oct., 1615.\r\n\r\nA name which we cannot omit to notice in connection with East Kirkby is\r\nthat of Silkstone; there being a monumental slab in the parish church of\r\nRobert de Silkeston, who died in 1347.  Among 14 documents in the\r\npossession of Porter Wilson, Esq., of Louth, this Robert is a principal\r\nparty in 13 of them; by which lands are conveyed to him by Ranulphus, son\r\nof Baldwin de Thorpe, in Ireby; by Robert, son of Philip de Kirkeby, in\r\nKirkby; by Walter de Kirkby, in Kirkby; by Hugo de Hatton, lands in\r\nKirkby; by Walter, son of Robert de Langena, lands in Kirkby; Robert, son\r\nof Adam Pertrich, of Bolingbroke; Alan, son of Walter de Kirkeby, and\r\nWilliam, son of Henry de Kirkeby, give him other lands in Kirkeby;\r\nBeatrice, widow of William Wriht, of Miningsby, gives him lands in\r\nMiningsby; John de Waynflet gives him lands in that parish; and Robert de\r\nSwylington, Thomas de Marketon, Rector of Hareby, and Robert de\r\nMiningsby, chaplain, grant to him lands in “Kirkby, Winthorpe, Thorp,\r\nWaynflet, Irby, ffriseby (Firsby), Boston, Leek, Wrangel, Stepying,\r\nfrrisseneye (Friskney), Bolynbrok, and Menyngesby,” by Deed, given at\r\nKirkebi, 26 Dec., 29 Ed. III. (1355).  Robert de Silkeston thus became a\r\nproprietor of large estates.  At a later period Sir Robert Sylkeston had\r\nissue Alicia, who was “maryed to Robert Grynne.” {126}  A large portion\r\nof the property passed to that family, and through them to the Skeppers\r\nalready mentioned; and from them, by marriage, to the Loddingtons; one of\r\nwhom, Thomas Loddington, was Vicar of Horncastle in the early years of\r\nthe 18th century; his name being on one of the church bells with date\r\n1717.\r\n\r\nSir John Browne, knight, resided here for several years, holding lands in\r\nEast Kirkby, conveyed to him by Lionel Goodrick in 1616, and on a dispute\r\narising between him and the Skeppers, already mentioned, an agreement was\r\nmade, 20 May, 1619, by which Sir John granted to Richard Skepper certain\r\nproperty, for 2,000 years, at a peppercorn rent, Richard Skepper in\r\nreturn granting to Sir John, other lands for a like term and\r\nconsideration.  (Mr. R. W. Goulding, “Linc. N & Q.,” vol. v. p. 75).\r\n\r\nSome of these lands were known as Bonthelandes, (Boothlands), West-wang,\r\nWayteclif, Bulgaire, Inge-croft, Langemer-dayles, Goutscroft, &c.\r\n\r\nSir John Browne was 2nd son of Sir Valentine Browne, of Croft, “Treasurer\r\nand Vittler of Barwicke, and Treasurer of Ireland in ye raigne of Queen\r\nElizabeth,” who married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Monson, of South\r\nCarlton, ancestor of Lord Oxenbridge.  Sir John Browne was “Sergant to\r\nKing James in his privy chamber.”  He married (1) Cicely, daughter of\r\nWilliam Kirkman, Esq., of Easter Keale, who only lived 20 weeks after\r\nmarriage; and (2), Francis, daughter of Richard Herbert, Esq., of\r\nMontgomerie Castle.  She was youngest sister of George Herbert, who wrote\r\nthe well-known poem, “The Country Parson,” and of Edward, Lord Herbert of\r\nCherbury, who was so prominent a figure in the time of Charles I.  They\r\nwere nearly related to the Pembroke family, and descended from Sir\r\nRichard Herbert of Edwd. IV.’s time.  There is an elaborate altar tomb in\r\nCroft church, with effigies of Sir Valentine and his lady above; and of\r\ntheir eight sons and seven daughters on the panels below.  Beside this is\r\nan equally elaborate monument of Sir John and his 2nd wife.  (“Arcitect.\r\nS. Journal,” vol. viii. pp. 70, 71).\r\n\r\nAnother family, with a good old Saxon name, connected with East Kirkby,\r\nwere the Elands (Ea-land or Eyland), representatives of whom have lived\r\nin this parish within quite recent times; the last of them being William\r\nFawcett Ealand residing at the High Hall in 1860–70.  The name means\r\nIsland-land, or water land. {127a}  Sir William de Eland was constable of\r\nNottingham castle in 1330, and M.P. for the county in 1333 (Baily’s\r\n“Annals,” vol. i. p. 223).  They possessed the “Honour of Peverel.”  In\r\nBaumber church there is a slab of John Ealand (obiit 1463) and his two\r\nwives, in the north aisle. {127b}  A branch of the family resided at\r\nRaithby near Louth.  Toward the close of the 16th century, one of them\r\nresided at Cawkwell, and had that manor and the advowson of the benefice.\r\n{128}  Others had estates, and lived at various places in Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the 17th century another family, the Webberley’s of\r\nAddlethorpe, resided at East Kirkby.  They intermarried with the Amcotts\r\nfamily, now represented by Colonel Cracroft Amcotts, of Hackthorne Hall,\r\nLincoln.  John Webberly, who was born here, was a strong partizan of\r\nCharles I., in his contentions with the Parliament.  He did not die for\r\nhis King on the field of battle like his compatriot Hallam, possibly of\r\nBolingbroke (see “Notes” on Bolingbroke); but his support of the King,\r\nand his religious opinions (Socinian), subjected him to persecution, and,\r\nin 1648, to much suffering from imprisonment.  He was afterwards expelled\r\nfrom Lincoln College, Oxford.  (Weir’s History, Ed. 1828, vol. i. p.\r\n415).\r\n\r\nThe church, dedicated to St. Nicholas, is pronounced by Mr. Jeans to be\r\n“one of the most interesting in this district, though sadly patched with\r\nbrick, and defaced with ugly windows.”  It is no longer used for\r\nservices, a small modern church having been recently erected more\r\nconveniently near the village.  The varied colouring of the edifice, from\r\nthe combination of grey-green crumbling sandstone, with the red tone of\r\nthe bricks, surrounded as it is also by lofty trees, render it a pleasing\r\nstudy for the artist, but its decayed condition inspires the fear that,\r\nunless tenderly dealt with, this interesting relic, may soon go to decay.\r\nIt is to be hoped in the interest of archæology that this may be averted.\r\n\r\nThe original Saxon church was mostly replaced by a later fabric, but now\r\nancient, of the 14th century.  It consists of nave, aisles, chancel and\r\ntower, having two bells; this tower probably dating from early in the\r\n13th century, occupies an unusual position, being attached to the south\r\naisle towards the west end of it.  Its lower storey forms a groined\r\nporch, having a head of the Saviour, rather rudely carved, as the central\r\ntop of the vault.  It has some early features, especially the window in\r\nits eastern face, but, we quote the late Precentor Venables, in a\r\ndescription given by him on the visit of the Architectural Society in\r\n1894.  Like the rest of the fabric, it has been patched and repaired at\r\nvarious periods, and most of the remains are debased.  The battlemented\r\nupper storey is Perpendicular, the fabric generally being Decorated, of\r\nthe 14th century.  Of the windows, however, there are few surviving of\r\nthat period, the west being the most noticeable.  It is of two lights,\r\nbeautifully designed, the mask heads of the hood moulding being remnants\r\nof an earlier style.  The side windows, both of nave and chancel, were\r\nsquare-headed.  One remains, to the west of the tower, portions of others\r\nremaining among modern degradations.  The eastern windows of both aisles\r\nhave flamboyant tracery, but now blocked and partly destroyed.  The\r\nblocked arch of an entrance to a north chantry which has been removed, is\r\nseen in the north aisle wall.  It must have been filled in at an early\r\ndate, as the window inserted is of the Tudor period.  The piscina of this\r\nchantry altar, with a square basin, is still to be seen outside the\r\nchurch.  In the north wall of the chancel, a small two-light window is\r\nworth attention as an excellent example of the purest Decorated.  The\r\nsouth chancel wall has three-light windows, with segmental heads and\r\nsuper-mullioned tracery of Perpendicular date; one of these has been\r\nremoved to form a poor east window, in place of a good 14th century\r\nwindow, destroyed a few years ago.  The eastern gable is surmounted by a\r\ngood cross and saddle stone.  The windows of the south aisle are of the\r\nmeanest type.  There is an arcade of four bays, with Decorated arches\r\nsupported on very slender octagonal piers, which are too tall and\r\nslender, and which drive up the arches too high.  The moulded brackets\r\nwhich serve as responds, being elaborately moulded, deserve notice.  The\r\nroofs are very poor, being of a later period; one of the beams bears the\r\ndate 1583.  The chancel arch has been decapitated and blocked by\r\nboarding, but the rood-screen below is an unusually good specimen of\r\nPerpendicular.  It has five bays, the centre being double the width of\r\nthe others, and having still its panelled doors.  It is 12ft. 4in. wide,\r\nand nearly 18ft. high. {129}  (Dr. Mansel Sympson, “Architect. S.\r\nJourn.,” 1890, p. 209).\r\n\r\nParts of the parclose which formerly enclosed the chantries at the ends\r\nof the aisles, still remain.  The Silkstone chantry on the south retains\r\nits decorated trefoil piscina.\r\n\r\nIn the floor of the south aisle is an incised slab, commemorative of Sir\r\nRobert Silkstone, the builder of the chantry and church.  The late Bishop\r\nTrollope’s rendering of the Latin inscription, which is somewhat defaced,\r\nthe slab being broken into four pieces, is as follows:—“Here is buried\r\nSir Robert Silkstone.  He erected this church and chantry.  He departed\r\nhence in 1347, and on the 14th of June lost his life.  To whom may God\r\never grant rest in Heaven.  Amen.”  The tradition is that he died an\r\nuntimely death, if not by his own hand.  (“Linc. N. & Q.,” 1896, p. 50).\r\n\r\nThe old oak seating remains at the west end, and there are fragments,\r\nscattered about, of other screen-work.  In the north wall of the chancel\r\nis a narrow trefoil-headed recess, thought by some to be an Easter\r\nsepulchre; it has a curious carved panel, with three kneeling figures,\r\nsupposed to be the three Maries, each holding a heart.  The recess is an\r\naumbrey, intended for the Host.  The projecting basin, which Mr. Bloxam\r\nthought was a receptacle for “creeping silver,” is a piscina and the\r\nso-called carved “hearts” are boxes for spice.  This portion of the\r\nservice of the Mass is referred to by Barnaby Googe (1570), in the\r\nlines:—\r\n\r\n    “While frankincense and sweet perfume\r\n    Before the shrine they burn.”\r\n\r\nThe font is a good sample of Perpendicular, having a panelled octagonal\r\nbowl, supported on a panelled shaft, standing on a platform of steps; the\r\npanels contain heads and flowers.  There are fragments of old stained\r\nglass scattered about the windows, and old encaustic tiles in the floor.\r\nA St. Edmund’s penny was found some years ago on the north side of the\r\nchurch, which the late Vicar, the Rev. G. Maughan, pronounced to have\r\nbeen issued before A.D. 905.  Not far distant, in the year 1899, on some\r\ncottages being pulled down, there were found some fragments of dog-tooth\r\npattern, and portions of columns and capitals, which are supposed to have\r\ncome originally from Revesby; these are now in the garden of Mr. T.\r\nColtman, at Hagnaby Priory.\r\n\r\nThe chantry on the north side of the church formerly existing, was called\r\nthe Jesus Chapel.  Here was buried William Goodrick, father of the Bishop\r\nof Ely, at his own request, by his will dated 20 March, 1517, to be\r\nburied “in the chapell of Jhus in my p’ysh church of Saint Nicholas.”\r\n{131}  “On the viij. Kal. Nov., 1344, Robert de Silkestone presented”\r\nThomas West, of Mucton, priest, to this chantry (then newly founded), and\r\non Kal. June 1346, he presented “Rob., son of John Fowler, of Mithingsby,\r\npriest, to the same chantry.”  (“Linc. N. & Q,” 1896, p. 51, note).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLUSBY.\r\n\r\n\r\nLusby (called in Domesday Book Lodeby and Luzebi), is distant from\r\nHorncastle about 6 miles, in an easterly direction, being 1 mile beyond\r\nWinceby.  Prior to the Norman Conquest, the Saxon Thane, Tonna, held\r\nlands here, as well as in other parishes in the neighbourhood, his\r\nproperty here being 3 carucates, or about 360 acres (Domesday).  Other\r\nowners of land were Almer, and his brother John, and his son Mauger.\r\nThese, at the Conquest, were mostly superseded by Normans.  William the\r\nConqueror gave to his nephew Gilbert de Gaunt, son of Baldwin, Earl of\r\nFlanders, whose sister was William’s Consort, 113 Manors in Lincolnshire,\r\nbesides several in other counties, among them being Lusby, the adjoining\r\nHagworthingham, and Grantham (Greetham), &c.  The property would seem,\r\nhowever, to have been only held by the Gaunts for three generations.  In\r\n1223 we find Simon de Kyme instituting a suit in the King’s Court to\r\nrecover certain lands in Lusby, as being the descendant and lawful\r\nrepresentative and heir of the aforesaid Almar.  He failed, however, to\r\nestablish his case.  (Curia Regis, Roll No. 82, Hilary, 7 Henry III.)  He\r\nstill, however, held lands in Langton and Sausthorpe; and he must also\r\nhave had other lands in Lusby, as we find that in the 9th year of King\r\nJohn he granted the fee of 1 knight to Walter de Bec, “to have and to\r\nhold of the same Simon and his heirs for ever.”\r\n\r\nThe superior lord, however, of all these parties, would seem to have been\r\nthe Bishop of Durham, a powerful and wealthy prelate.  Early in the 12th\r\ncentury (circa 1114) we find that Ranulph, Bishop of Durham, held in\r\nchief, lands in Lusby, and several other parishes in the neighbourhood,\r\nand one Pinson was tenant under him at Lusby, holding by the service of\r\nacting as the bishop’s bailiff.  Whether this Pinson was the same as\r\nPinso, sworn brother in arms of Eudo, the Norman lord of Tattershall, is\r\nnot clear; but it seems likely, as the Bishop of Durham, his over-lord,\r\nalso held lands in Tattershall.  (N.B.—The author of “The History of\r\nSpilsby,” Rev. H. Cotton-Smith, says that he was; p. 24).  But through\r\nthe Pinsons, Lusby, Winceby, and other manors passed to another family,\r\nalready named, which for some time held an important position in the\r\ncounty, the Beks or Becs.  There is some confusion in the different\r\nrecords of the earlier generations of this family.  Walter de Bek was the\r\nscion of a family of Norman blood, whose ancestor, according to Sir\r\nWilliam Dugdale in his “Baronage,” had “a faire inheritance in Flanders,”\r\nbut came over with the Conqueror.  This Walter de Bec married Agnes,\r\ndaughter of Hugh Pinson, the steward, and had by her five sons, Hugh,\r\nHenry, Walter, John, and Thomas.  Of these, Henry succeeded to the manors\r\nof Eresby, Spilsby, Scrivelsby, and Wispington; and Walter became “Lord\r\nof Lusceby, Wynceby, Neuton (_i.e._ Wold Newton) and ffoulstow\r\n(Fulstow).”  (Lansdown MSS. 207, cf., 453).  The Becs were a family of\r\ngreat influence.  Of two brothers, one, Anthony, was Bishop of Durham,\r\nthe other, Thomas, was Bishop of St. David’s, and another Anthony, was\r\nBishop of Norwich, his brother being Bishop of Lincoln, in days when\r\nBishops were statesmen and even soldiers, as well as proud prelates.\r\nWalter was Constable of the Castle of Lincoln (Harleyan MSS, f. 23).\r\n\r\nIn the old documents called “Final Concords,” p. 80., under date “17 May,\r\nA.D. 1208,” we find Walter Bec, named as “tenant of one knight’s fee in\r\nLusceby.”  In 1300 A.D. Sir John Bek, like his father, was Constable of\r\nLincoln Castle, but also holding the additional office of Constable of\r\nBristol.  He made a grant to the Priory of Bullington, near Wragby, which\r\nis worthy of notice, as its terms are peculiar.  It runs as follows:—“I,\r\nJohn son of Walter Beck, of Lusceby, have granted, &c., for ever to prior\r\nand convent of Bolington, for the safety of my soul, and the souls of my\r\nancestors, two selions of land, &c., which formerly, Simon, merchant of\r\nBurgh, held of me for one pair of white gloves.”  We have mention, in the\r\ncase of High Toynton, of land, held by the tenure of a pair of spurs,\r\npresented annually to the lord, as rent; here we have a no less singular\r\ntenure, by the gift of a pair of gloves.  The knightly gauntlet was\r\nprobably in those days a more costly article than a nineteenth or\r\ntwentieth century glove.  In illustration of the above peculiar tenure,\r\nwe may notice the legacy of Baron Bec’s “gauntlets” to Kirkstead.  This\r\nJohn, son of Walter, was created first Baron Bec of Eresby; he obtained a\r\nlicense to fortify his castle at Eresby, 1295.  By his will, dated July\r\n20, 1301, he ordered his body to be buried at Kirkstead, whereunto he\r\ngives his best horse, his mail coat, “gauntlets,” harness of iron, lance,\r\ntarge and other accoutrements.  His daughter married Sir William\r\nWilloughby.\r\n\r\nMost of the property of the Lusby Beks passed, a generation or two later,\r\nto another branch of the family, the Becks of Eresby; whose descendant,\r\nJohn Willoughby, through the marriage of Baron Bec’s daughter to Sir\r\nWilliam Willoughby, in the reign of Edwd. III., held the manors of\r\n“Hareby, Lusceby, Ester Kele, Wester Kele,” &c.; and thus the property\r\npassed to the ancestors of the present Earl of Ancaster, and Lord\r\nWilloughby d’ Eresby.  We still, however, find (by Feet of Fines,\r\nLincoln, file 69) that in A.D. 1302, John Bek had “the rent of 6 quarters\r\nof salt, {133} in Wispington, Marton next Horncastle, Langtone,\r\nWodehalle, Thymelby, Scrivelsby,” and other parishes, “with advowson of\r\nthe church of Wispington.”  “Henry Bek, of Pusseby (Lusby), sold to Lord\r\nStephen de Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, lands and tenement in\r\nffowlestow; which same bishop gave the said manor to Beatrice, his\r\nsister, who was married to Alan de Normanby.”  (Lansdowne MSS. 207, cf.,\r\n453).  For these details of the Becks, I am chiefly indebted to a paper,\r\nby Rev. W. O. Massingberd, in the “Architect. Soc. Journal,” for 1897.\r\n\r\nTo show that the Becs were not confined to the neighbourhood of Eresby\r\nand Lusby, I may mention that, not only are their armorial quarterings\r\nfound, as was to be expected, in Spilsby church, but according to Gervase\r\nHolles’ “Notes on Churches,” they formerly existed in windows in the\r\nchurches of Coningsby and Langton-by-Horncastle, and probably many\r\nothers.  (Harleyan MSS., 6829.)\r\n\r\nOf later proprietors of Lusby, I am not able to give any, except that, in\r\na List (given in the Melbourne Hall MSS.) of Gentry, of the 16th century,\r\nwho furnished launces and light horses, when the country was preparing to\r\ngive a warm reception to the expected Spanish Armada, I find that Mr.\r\nPalfreyman of Lusby, gent., attended the muster at the Horncastle\r\nSessions in 1586, and furnished 1 launce and 1 light horse, when his\r\nneighbour, Mr. Langton, of Langton, and Augustine Cavendish, of Orby,\r\nfurnished each 1 light horse, but no lance; John Littlebury of\r\nHagworthingham, furnishing 2 light horses and no lance.  Mr. Maddison\r\nexplains that this Mr. Palfreyman would be a descendant of William\r\nPalfreyman, who was Mayor of Lincoln in 1536.  (“Arch. Soc. Journ.” 1894,\r\npp. 214, 220).\r\n\r\nIn Liber Regis we also find the names of those who presented to the\r\nbenefice, and therefore were in some way connected with the place; George\r\nDavenport in 1699, Carr Brackenbury in 1720, and Robert Carr Brackenbury\r\nin 1780.  In recent times the bishops of Lincoln seem to have inherited\r\nthe position formerly held by the bishops of Durham, as owners of the\r\nsoil and lords of the manor; and these are now in the hands of the\r\nEcclesiastical Commissions.\r\n\r\nWe now come to speak of the church, dedicated to St. Peter.  At the date\r\nof Domesday Book, this was one of the 222 parishes in the county which\r\npossessed a church.  A priest is also there named, doubtless one of the\r\n131 only resident presbyters in the county; many of the churches being\r\nserved by the “Religious” of the convents.  There is also mention of a\r\nmill, worth 3_s._ yearly. {135}\r\n\r\nThere was thus at Lusby a church at that early period, and it, as well as\r\nWinceby, paid a pension to the Bardney Monastery, probably through the\r\nconnection with Gilbert de Gaunt, that Norman noble being one of\r\nBardney’s most generous patrons, and the re-founder of that institution\r\nafter it had been in a state of decay for some 200 years.  Ecton’s\r\nThesaurus gives the pension as 30_s._, a fairly large sum in those days.\r\n\r\nThe present very interesting church is, in parts, so very ancient, that\r\nit is more than likely that some portions of the original fabric of that\r\nday still remain.  Only a few years ago the building was in a state of\r\nsqualid neglect and architectural disfigurement; but it was restored by\r\nthe Commissioners in 1892, and re-opened by the Bishop of Lincoln on\r\nJanuary 17, 1893, the work having been done with great care and judgment;\r\nand the former flat-ceiled, white-washed room has given place to a\r\nstructure church-like in all its arrangements.  It is nevertheless of a\r\nsomewhat conglomerate character, windows, and other objects, breaking\r\nout, as it were, in all sorts of unexpected positions; and thus making it\r\na study of curiosities.  We quote here some of the remarks of the late\r\nPrecentor Venables made on the occasion of the visit of the Architectural\r\nSociety in 1894, “of the original Norman fabric, itself of more than one\r\ndate, and which was shortened at the west end, there are several relics,\r\nespecially in the charming narrow doorway in the north wall of the nave,\r\nnow built up, the arch of which is surrounded with zigzag moulding; and a\r\nvery remarkable little ‘key-hole’ window, high up in the north wall of\r\nthe chancel.  An incised line which runs round the head of this ends in\r\nvolutes, and above it is a small incised cross.  Holes in the jamb of the\r\nshutter indicate that this widow was originally unglazed.  Opposite the\r\nnorth doorway are traces of another Norman doorway in the south wall,\r\nalso now blocked, having above it a cross with round medallions.”\r\nEastward in this same south wall of the nave is a two-light early English\r\nwindow with quatrefoil above, in the eastern splay of which, inside the\r\nchurch, is a small, but “singularly fine corbel head, crowned.”\r\nImmediately eastward of the chancel arch in the south wall of the chancel\r\nis a small square window, possibly a squint; and east of this a very\r\nnarrow small “lancet window has been opened,” and still east of this, at\r\na different elevation, there is a good two-light decorated window.  The\r\nchancel arch is round-headed and plain; on either side of it are a pair\r\nof Norman pillars, with the capitals hacked away; those on the north side\r\npartly retain their rounded columns.  There is a perpendicular screen\r\nacross the chancel arch of three compartments above with ogee arches and\r\nrichly carved finials, the central compartment being open; and below are\r\ntwo panels on either side the central open compartment, having ogee\r\narches within semi-circular rims.  On the north side of the chancel arch\r\nis a niche for a figure.  In the north wall of the chancel is an aumbrey,\r\nand an oblong one above it; and in the south wall a square one\r\ncorresponding.  In the south wall, under the easternmost window, is an\r\neaster sepulchre a plain semi-circular arched recess, probably marking\r\nthe tomb of the founder.  In the north wall of the nave is a similar, but\r\nrather larger recess.  The east window has three lights, quatrefoiled,\r\nwith trefoiled compartments above, and a quatrefoil above these.  The\r\nwest door is square-headed with a low arch within; over this a\r\nthree-light quatrefoiled widow with square-headed moulding above; and\r\nover this, in the gable, a square, slit widow, above which hangs the one\r\nbell in a large turret.  The font on the north side of the west door, is\r\nmodern, circular, massive, of Caen stone.  The sittings are of deal; the\r\npulpit, lectern, and chancel sedilia, of modern oak; the roof throughout\r\nof pitch pine.  There is a small brass tablet of date circa 1600, with\r\neight English rhyming lines, forming a dialogue between a deceased wife\r\nand her surviving husband.  The stones of the walls are of all sizes and\r\nshapes, and the massive western buttresses are 5ft. thick.  The benefice,\r\na rectory, is now held with that of Hagworthingham, and is in the\r\nincumbency of the Rev. G. R. Ekins, who resides at the latter place.\r\n\r\nLetters, _via_ Spilsby, arrive at 8 a.m., and are despatched at 5 p.m.\r\n\r\nASGARBY, which is ecclesiastically annexed to the benefice of Lusby, lies\r\nabout six miles south-east of Horncastle, being about a mile south by\r\neast of Winceby, by which it is reached from Horncastle, and about a mile\r\nwest of Lusby.  Letters, via Spilsby, arrive at 8.30 a.m.  The nearest\r\nmoney order office is at Old Bolingbroke, and the nearest telegraph\r\noffice at East Kirkby, about 5 miles distant.  The whole parish comprises\r\nabout 760 acres, divided into two farms, the property of Ecclesiastical\r\nCommissioners, and occupied respectively, Asgarby Hall farm by Mr. M.\r\nDunham, and the Asgarby House farm by Mr. W. H. Robinson, both these\r\nresidences being substantial structures of considerable age.  It has been\r\nasked “What’s in a name?” yet the name Asgarby would seem significant.\r\nIts elements are “as” (or Aes), “gar” (guard or garth), {137} and “by”;\r\nthe first of these implying the presence of “water,” the second meaning,\r\n“an enclosure”; and the third “a building”; thus we have, as the meaning\r\nof the whole, “a water-enclosed building,” or moated residence.  The hall\r\nstands on an elevation, commanding an extensive view, and there are\r\nvarious hollows and banks still existing, which probably indicate the\r\nmoat which at one time surrounded a more important building than the\r\npresent hall.  This is confirmed by the stews, or fish-ponds, lying\r\nwestward below the hall, which imply that the establishment required an\r\nextensive fish diet, on the numerous Romish fast days.  The demesne is\r\ngiven in Domesday Book, along with Hareby, Mavis Enderby, Raithby, and\r\nmany others, which became the property of Ivo Taillebois, by his marriage\r\nwith the Lady Lucia, daughter of the powerful Saxon Earl Alfgar,\r\nfather-in-law of King Harold.  It probably passed at a later period to\r\nthe Bishops of Durham, who held many lordships in the neighbourhood; and\r\nultimately came to the Bishops of Lincoln, who were lords of the manor,\r\nuntil the transference in 1862, of episcopal property to the\r\nEcclesiastical Commissioners, who have since that time, owned the estate.\r\n\r\nThe Benefice, now worth £40 a year, is described in Liber Regis, as a\r\ncuracy.  It, however, gives its name to a prebendal stall in Lincoln\r\nCathedral.  The church, dedicated to St. Swithin, is an unpretending\r\nstructure, of no architectural merit; but since it was re-seated, with\r\ndeal fittings, in 1882, it has been kept, to say the least, in a neat\r\ncondition.  It is doubtless one of the smallest parish churches in the\r\nkingdom, the nave being slightly over 20ft. in length, and the chancel\r\nabout 9ft.  The east window has two lights, in debased style.  There is a\r\nthree-light debased window in the north wall, and a corresponding one in\r\nthe south wall.  The pulpit is of modern oak.  There is a tablet on the\r\nsouth nave wall in memory of Sarah, wife of John Parkinson, “greatly\r\nadmired for her virtue, frugality, and charity,” who died 17 May, 1816;\r\nalso in memory of John Parkinson, her husband, who died May 15, 1821.\r\n\r\nIn the north wall of the chancel is a memorial tablet of the Rev. W.\r\nWard, Incumbent, who died 26 Nov., 1846.  The one bell hangs in a turret\r\nover the west door.  The register dates from 1575.  Canon Oldfield, who\r\nholds the benefice, with that of Lusby, is also Rector of Hagworthingham,\r\nwhere he resides.  Asgarby Benefice is now held with Lusby, by Rev. C. E.\r\nBolam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMININGSBY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiningsby is situated about 7 miles from Horncastle in a south-easterly\r\ndirection, and is approached by way of Mareham-on-the-Hill and\r\nHameringham.  It is seven miles from Spilsby westward, and 9 miles\r\nnorth-east of Tattershall Station.  Letters, _via_ Boston, arrive at 9\r\na.m.  The nearest money order and telegraph office is at East Kirkby.\r\n\r\nIn the time of the Conqueror, this manor belonged to his nephew, Ivo\r\nTaillebois, through his marriage with the Lady Lucia, the rich heiress of\r\nthe Saxon Thorolds.  It is stated in Domesday Book to comprise 6\r\ncarucates of land rateable to gelt (_i.e._, 720 acres), worked by\r\nthirty-six soke-men, eight villeins, and 4 bordars, who had also 40 acres\r\nof meadow, {138} which is several acres in excess of the present\r\nmeasurement.\r\n\r\nMiningsby was connected with Spalding Priory in the following manner.\r\nThat monastery was founded by Thorold de Buchenale (_i.e._, Bucknall,\r\nnear Horncastle), A.D. 952; and the Lady Lucia, his niece and heiress, in\r\nconjunction with her husband Ivo Taillebois (who was Lord of Spalding),\r\nadded largely to the original endowment from her uncle.  The churches of\r\nBolingbroke, Stickney, and other parishes, with “half the Church of East\r\nKeal,” were given to the priory; also tithes from Claxby, Edlington,\r\nMinting, Gautby, &c., and “temporalities” from Haltham, Bolingboke,\r\nMiningsby, &c., the latter including two carucates (or 240 acres) of land\r\nin Miningsby.  On the Dissolution of the Monasteries, by Henry VIII.,\r\nseveral of these properties passed to the crown, and became connected\r\nwith the Duchy of Lancaster, and the “Honour of Bolingbroke.”  We mention\r\nin the Notes on Revesby, and other parishes, how those and other lands,\r\npassed, through the Lady Lucia’s son (by her 2nd husband), William de\r\nRomara, to the Abbey of Revesby, and at a later period to the Stanhopes,\r\nand, by a parallel process, although through a distinct channel, the\r\nStanhopes are now lords of the manor of Miningsby, and own most of the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nFrequent mention is made of Miningsby in the ancient Revesby Abbey\r\ncharters. {139}  By charters No. 1 B. and C., William de Romara conveys\r\nto the abbey, 23 acres of land in Miningsby, as well as common pasture in\r\nthe same.  Among the witnesses to the latter, is Baldric de Cheles, a\r\nname still represented in the neighbourhood, by the family of the Rev.\r\nAlan Cheales, rector of Friskney, and owner of land in Hagworthingham,\r\n&c.  By charter No. 7 C., Hugo Wac confirms to the Abbot of Revesby “two\r\noxgangs (or 30 acres) of land in Miningsby with right of pasturage and\r\nthe hermitage, which Ranulph the Monk made in Halton marsh.”  This Hugo\r\nWac, would seem to be a representative of the ancient Lincolnshire Saxon\r\nfamily of the Wakes, whose most distinguished member was “Hereward the\r\nWake,” lord of Bourne, the last hero of Anglo-Saxon independence, whose\r\n“Camp of Refuge” for some time defied the Conqueror, and whose exploits\r\nhave been celebrated in prose and verse.  By charter No. 39, Alan son of\r\nRanulph, of Miningsby, gives 2 perches of meadow in “Sud Bec” (south\r\nbeck) in Miningsby, free of all service and claims (temp. Henry II. or\r\nRichard I.)  We may mention here that this Miningsby beck is now the\r\nchief feeder of the reservoir which furnishes Boston with its water\r\nsupply.  By charter No. 40 B., Richard I. confirms to the monks of\r\nRevesby certain lands and possessions in Miningsby, Kirkby, Claxby,\r\nMareham, &c.  This is witnessed by Hubert Walter, Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, Robert de Harecourt and others.  By No. 41, a plot of land in\r\nMiningsby is given “for the use of the gate-monk, and for gate alms,” at\r\nthe abbey, by William, son of Roger de Bikinghesby (Wilksby?) temp.\r\nRichard I. or John.  By No. 59, William Helle, of Miningsby, gives the\r\nright of pasturage for 60 sheep in Miningsby, free of all claim.  By No.\r\n63, William, son of Ivo, of Kirkby, gives land adjoining the place from\r\nwhich the sand was taken for building Miningsby church, near\r\n“Crosbesich.”  By No. 115, William, son of John Barette, of Stickney,\r\nresiding at Miningsby, gives one perch of meadow, “for the maintenance of\r\ntwo candles always burning in the Abbey Chapel.”  (Date Henry III. or Ed.\r\nI.)  By No. 119, Nicholas, son of Roger Herod of Miningsby, gives “one\r\nmeadow, free of all claims,” and stipulates that “the monks shall pay\r\nannually one penny towards maintaining the light before the image of St.\r\nNicholas, in Kirkby church, every St. Nicholas Day.”  By No. 131, Alan of\r\nMiningsby, gives “one selion, {140} and four akerheveds” of land in\r\nMiningsby, in two places, called “Hankes” and “Claxby dale,” free of all\r\nclaim (date, Ed. I.)  By charter No. 150 B., the King, Henry VIII.,\r\ngrants to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, all rights and property,\r\nhitherto belonging to the monastery of Revesby, in Miningsby, Moorby,\r\nWood Enderby, Wilksby, East Kirkby, and many other places, “having come\r\ninto our hands by reason of the dissolution of the said monastery.”  The\r\nDuke’s title is to date from March 1, in the 29th year of our reign, A.D.\r\n1538.  (British Museum, additional MSS. 24805, fol. 32).\r\n\r\nAmong “Lincolnshire Wills,” we find Richard Skepper, of East Kirkby, in\r\nhis will, dated 26 May, 1556, mentioning among other land, which he\r\ndevises, certain copyhold lands in Miningsby.\r\n\r\nBy will, dated 22 Dec. 1615, Robert Hustwait, of Great Grimsby, makes his\r\nbrother, Edward Hustwait, of Miningsbye, and his cousin, Tristram Smith,\r\nof Awdbee Grange, supervisors, and gives them twenty shillings each.  The\r\nHusthwaites were above the yeoman class, but not important enough to\r\nappear in the Visitations of the Heralds; they intermarried with the\r\nWrights of Grimsby and Smyths of Audby, and lived at Little Coates and\r\nBradley.\r\n\r\nBy a Chancery Inquisition post mortem, 23 Henry VII., No. 78 (A.D.\r\n1507–8), taken at Horncastle, Jan. 14th, John Parke of Mynyngesby, John\r\nSkayman, of Mynyngesby, being among the jurors, it was shewn that Thomas,\r\nthe Abbott of Revesby, was entitled to hold from the King, among other\r\nlands, 10 acres of arable land and 4 acres of meadow, called “Symondes\r\nlands” in Mynyngesby (“Architect. S. Journal,” 1895, p. 59),\r\nnotwithstanding the Statute of Mortmain.\r\n\r\nBy a Feet of Fines, Lincoln, file 68 (32), 30 Edw. I., Robert de Wylgheby\r\n(Willoughby) granted to John Beek (Bec) certain lands in Hareby, Kyrkeby,\r\nBolyngbrok, Mythyggesby, &c., and “the advowsons of the churches of\r\nSpillesby, Kyrkeby next Bolingbroke, and the Church of Toynton.”\r\n(“Architect. S. Journal,” 1897, p. 56.)\r\n\r\nAmong the deeds connected with property in East Kirkby, now in the\r\npossession of Porter Wilson, Esq., of Louth, is one, by which Beatrix,\r\nwife of William Wriht of Mythingesby, quitclaims to Robert de Silkeston,\r\nand Robert, son of Isabella Skells (Scales), all her right in the lands\r\nand tenements in Mythingesby, which they held of the gift of the said\r\nWilliam her late husband.  Given at Kyrkeby juxta Bolingbrok, on Thursday\r\nnext before the feast of St. Michael, 1 Edw. III. (A.D. 1327.)\r\n\r\nBy another Deed, “Robert de Menynggesby, chaplain,” with “Thomas de\r\nMarketon, Rector of Harreby,” and another, “give to Robert de Silkeston\r\nof Kyrkeby,” certain lands “in Menyngesby, Kirkby, Bolynbrok, &c.”  Given\r\nat Kirkeby, 26 Dec., 29 Edw. III. (A.D. 1355.)\r\n\r\nAmong charters of the Ipré family, it is shewn that Sir John de Ipré\r\nacquired “lands in Est Kerkeby, Mithyngesby, &c., of Sir John de Nevill,\r\nknight, Lord of Raby; which property descended to his son Thomas Ipré,\r\nwho granted the said lands for the use of Robert Grynne, and Richard\r\nGrynne his son.”  Date, 31 December, 1392.\r\n\r\nN.B.—Sir Robert Sylkeston, knyght, of Est Kyrkeby, had issue “Alicia\r\nmaryed unto Robert Grynne”; whose great great granddaughter “Audrya\r\nmaryed unto Ric. Skepper,” a member of the family already mentioned.\r\n(“Linc. N.& Q,” v., pp. 73–4.)\r\n\r\nBy a Deed, dated 19 May, 24 Henry VI. (1446), Henry the King orders that\r\ncertain rents for lands in Est Kirkby, Menyngesby, &c., which had been\r\nunlawfully withheld by Alice Browne, shall be duly paid to John Grynne,\r\nand Richard, his son, “they being at the time of acquisition, men (_i.e._\r\nbond-tenants) of our manor.”  “Given under our seal of our Duchy of\r\nLancaster at our palace of Westminster.”  (“Linc. N. & Q.” vol. v. p.\r\n89.)\r\n\r\nAccording to Liber Regis, there was formerly a charge of 1_s._ 6_d._\r\nannually on certain lands in Miningsby, towards the repairs of the church\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nThe Church, dedicated to St. Andrew, consists of nave, chancel and a\r\ndouble bell-gable at the west end.  It was restored at the expense of J.\r\nBanks Stanhope, Esq., in 1878, when nearly the whole fabric was taken\r\ndown by the architect, the late Mr. James Fowler, of Louth, and carefully\r\nreconstructed so as to preserve its most interesting features.  The stone\r\nthen employed is already (1901) showing signs of decay.  The south wall\r\nof the nave retains portions of an earlier Norman building, viz., one\r\nNorman window and a semi-circular headed doorway, set flush with the\r\nwall, enclosing a later pointed arch, also set flush. {142a}  The chancel\r\nis early English, with lancet windows, in the east end and side walls;\r\nthere is also a lancet window in the north wall of the nave.  There was\r\nformerly a chantry in the north side of the church, the arch of which is\r\nnow blocked.  In the west wall are two tall trefoil windows.  The font is\r\nperpendicular, with octagonal embattled bowl, supported by four columns\r\nwith square flowers in the capitals.  The chancel is separated from the\r\nnave by a good open rood screen, containing portions of the original.\r\nThe whole interior presents a well-ordered church appearance. {142b}  The\r\nobject, however, of special interest here, is a so-called “Runic” stone,\r\ncovered with the involuted “knot,” or “figure of eight” pattern.  Not\r\nmany years ago it formed the threshold of a door, but was rescued by the\r\nRev. G. Maughan, rector of East Kirkby, when he had charge of this\r\nparish, who had it placed against the north wall of the chancel.  It is\r\nfortunately still in a very fair condition, with the exception of a\r\nportion gone from one end, and a crack towards the other end.  There are,\r\nor were recently, two other specimens in the neighbourhood, one, a\r\nfragment at Lusby, and the other at Mavis Enderby.  The Lusby fragment is\r\nsaid to have been Norman.  (“Linc. N. & Q.” vol. iv. p. 225).  That at\r\nMavis Enderby, now used as a church door step, and the pattern,\r\nconsequently much defaced, is, like this at Miningsby, said to be of\r\npre-Norman style, though not necessarily pre-Norman date.  The former,\r\nhowever, is coped, while the latter is flat.  The Rev. G. Maughan\r\nbelieved that there was another similar stone within the same chancel\r\nwall, but, as that part of the fabric was not taken down by the\r\narchitect, it was not exposed to view.  (“Linc. N. & Q.” vol. iii. p.\r\n157.)  The frill border of the Miningsby stone is decidedly Saxon in\r\ncharacter.  It is 44 inches long, by 19½ wide, and 6in. thick.  These\r\nstones are specially interesting and far from common.  Interlaced work\r\nwas an ancient Hittite ornament, as shewn in a seal, engraved in the\r\n“Archæological Journal,” vol. xliv. p. 348.  Specimens are found,\r\nhowever, in Italy, Greece, France, as well as similar patterns in Saxon,\r\nLombardic, and Spanish MSS.  The stones are more common in Ireland than\r\nin England.  Several are found like the Iona cross in Scotland, probably\r\nimported from Ireland, by the missionaries of St. Columba.  There is an\r\nexcellent sketch of the Miningsby stone, by the Rev. J. A. Penny, vicar\r\nof Wispington, in “Lincolnshire Notes and Queries,” vol. iv., p. 225.\r\n\r\nAfter the Reformation, the earliest presentation which we find to this\r\nbenefice is that of William Clerke, by King Edward VI. (as Duke of\r\nLancaster); he was instituted as rector, 4, Edwd. VI., A.D. 1550–1.\r\n(“Architect. S. Journal,” 1897, p. 23.)\r\n\r\nRecent rectors have been the Rev. E. Repton, in the earlier years of the\r\ncentury; the Rev. W. Nevins, later; and the Rev. H. Caukwell, appointed\r\nin 1878.  The register dates from 1688, earlier records being lost.  The\r\nchildren have a right to go to the free school of East Kirkby.\r\n\r\nThere is a modern commodious house, occupied by the present rector, who\r\nhas 170 acres of glebe; but it is remarkable that about 100 acres of\r\nglebe are missing; the award made by the commissioners in lieu of tithe\r\nbeing largely in excess of the land now attached to the benefice.  This\r\nparish also contains about 100 acres of charity land belonging to\r\nStamford school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOXCOMBE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis parish is situated about 7 miles, in a north-easterly direction from\r\nHorncastle, and about the same distance south-west from Louth.  It is\r\ninteresting to notice that in the name of this parish we have one of the\r\nfew survivals in the county of its former British inhabitants.  The old\r\nwriter, William Camden, Clarenceaux King of Arms, in his “Remaines\r\nconcerning Britain,” p. 116, A.D. 1657, says “Combe, a word in use both\r\nin France and England, for a valley between high hills.”  It is, in fact,\r\nthe term still common in the south of England for a secluded valley, as\r\nin such names as Pyecombe, in Sussex, a village nestling in a hollow at\r\nthe base of the south Downs; Combe Pyne, and Combe Martin, in Devonshire,\r\nand many another similar name, as well as in the old Welsh (or British)\r\n“cwm,” which occurs in many a name in Wales, of places situated in like\r\nhill-locked positions.  And this exactly describes the situation of\r\nOxcombe, a valley almost cup-shaped, surrounded by steep hills, the whole\r\nparish now forming one estate, of something over 1,000 acres in extent,\r\nlying in a ring fence.\r\n\r\nIn Domesday Book it is also called Oxetune, in which the suffix “tune,”\r\nor “ton,” is the later Saxon for inclosure, implying a secluded\r\nfarmstead, where some Saxon Thane’s cattle were housed.  In that record\r\nof the Norman Conqueror, of which the date for Lincolnshire is about 1085\r\nA.D., this parish is mentioned twice, once, as connected with the manor\r\nof Fulletby, which was among the lands conferred by William the\r\nConqueror, on the Bishop of Durham, William de Karilepho, a Norman, who\r\nwas a favourite with that king, and was appointed by him Chief Justice of\r\nEngland; and once among the possessions of the Norman noble, Hugh de\r\nAbrinchis (or Avranches), who was nephew of the Conqueror, and, besides\r\nbeing endowed by him with the Barony of the whole county of Chester, held\r\nalso nearly one hundred and fifty manors in this County and elsewhere.\r\nHe was surnamed Lupus or “The Wolf” (as has been stated in other of these\r\nrecords) from the many deeds of violence, for which he was famed; and for\r\nwhich he endeavoured to atone in the closing years of his somewhat\r\nlawless life, by becoming a monk in the Abbey of St. Werberg, at Chester,\r\nwhich he had himself founded.\r\n\r\nThe part of this manor, held by the Bishop of Durham, was combined with\r\nFulletby, the adjoining parish westward, and was, under the Bishop,\r\nfarmed by socmen, or free tenants.  The portion belonging to Lupus was\r\nheld by him, as in the soke of Farforth, another adjoining parish\r\neastward, and was also farmed by socmen.\r\n\r\nHugh de Abrincis left one son, who succeeded to his estates; but, as we\r\nhave elsewhere observed, the tenure of land was, in those unsettled\r\ntimes, very precarious, and we have evidence that lands in Oxcombe, at an\r\nearly date, passed into other hands.  The land became in part the\r\nproperty of Bullington Priory, which was an off-shoot of the Gilbertine\r\nPriory, of Sempingham, famous for the severity of its monastic rules.\r\nBullington Priory was founded by Simon Fitzwilliam, {145a} in the reign\r\nof Stephen, and endowed with various lands in the neighbourhood.  These\r\nendowments were augmented by William de Kyme, a member of another\r\npowerful family in the county, who had also lands at Sotby, and\r\nelsewhere; and further additions were made by the Crevecœurs, {145b} a\r\nfamily of much importance from the time of the Norman Conquest, Sir Hamon\r\nde Crevecœur succeeding to the barony of the Abrincis, located in Kent,\r\nwith the title of Barons of Folkstone; while in this immediate\r\nneighbourhood, they held the lands in Somersby and Bag Enderby.  A few\r\nold records exist showing ownership in Oxcombe, at an early date, by\r\nseveral other parties.\r\n\r\nBy an agreement made under date, 15 June, 1202, between Matilda, wife of\r\nRichard de Ormsby, on the one part, and Walter Futenglaz, tenant of\r\ncertain lands in Oxcombe, the said Walter, on his part, acknowledged the\r\nsaid lands to be the right and inheritance of Matilda; and in return\r\nMatilda granted them to Walter, to hold to him and his heirs, of the said\r\nMatilda, and her heirs for ever, by the service of 12_d._ by the year;\r\nand for this grant, the said Walter gave her ½ mark.  (“Final Concords.”)\r\n\r\nWe next get a connection of this parish with the Priories of Sempringham\r\nand Bullington, already referred to.  By an agreement, dated 20 April,\r\n1203, between Roger, Prior of Sempringham, and William de Oxecumbe,\r\ntouching lands in the parish, the said William “warranted to the said\r\nprior and his successors, the charters which the same prior had of\r\nWilliam, father of the said William, and all the said lands; and he\r\ngranted them to hold to the said prior and his successors, and to the\r\nchurch of the blessed Mary of Bulinton, and to the Nuns and the Brethren\r\nserving God there, in pure and perpetual alms, free of all secular\r\nservice and exaction.”  And for this grant and warrant, the prior gave\r\nthe said William 2 marks.\r\n\r\nAnother document introduces a member of an important family holding\r\nconsiderable possessions in Yorkshire and elsewhere.  It is an agreement,\r\ndated 26 April, 1214, between Robert de Malo Lacu and Emma his wife, on\r\nthe one part, and Robert de Oxecumbe and others, among them being Walter\r\nBec, on the other part, concerning the right to certain lands which\r\nWalter Bec “acknowledges to be the right of the said Robert de Malo Lacu,\r\nand Emma, his wife,” &c.  In return for which they grant to the said\r\nWalter, 12 oxgangs of land, here and elsewhere, “to have and to hold to\r\nhim and his heirs for ever, doing the service of five parts of a knight’s\r\nfee.”  This Walter Bec would appear to have been a member of the wealthy\r\nfamily who are mentioned in the Records of Spilsby and Lusby, as holding\r\nlarge property in those parishes and elsewhere, and as being ancestors of\r\nthe Lords of Willoughby.  The de Malo Lacu family, otherwise de Mauley\r\nwere powerful Normans; the head of the race, Peter de Malo Lacu being\r\nborn at Poictou in France.  He, coming over to England in the reign of\r\nHenry III., built the castle of Mountgrace, in the East Riding of\r\nYorkshire.  Camden, states that there were eight Peters in succession who\r\nheld these estates, the last of them leaving two daughters, one of whom\r\nmarried Bigot, a member of the family of the Earl Marechal, of England;\r\nthe other married a member of the knightly family of Salvain, and the de\r\nMauley estates were divided between these two families.  The arms of the\r\nLords de Malo Lacu were a bend, sable, on an escutcheon, or.  (“Hist. of\r\nMeux Abbey,” quoted Camden’s “Britannia,” pp. 751, &c.)\r\n\r\nBy deed, dated 25 November, 1218, in a dispute between the same Matilda,\r\nwife of Richard Ormesby, and William, Prior of Bolinton, concerning the\r\nadvowson of the church of Oxecumb, the said Prior recognised the advowson\r\nto be the right of Matilda, and for himself and his successors\r\nsurrendered it to the said Matilda and her heirs for ever, an unusual act\r\nof grace, as it was rarely that any property passing into the possession\r\nof a religious house left their grasp again, until the time came when\r\nthey had finally and for ever to disgorge their acquisitions, not seldom\r\nquestionably obtained.  On 12 May, 1240, in a dispute between Robert, son\r\nof Osbert, and Matilda de Marton, concerning land in Oxecumbe, Matilda\r\nadmitted the said land to be the right of Robert, “to have and to hold to\r\nhim and his heirs for ever, he rendering 4_s._ by the year, and doing\r\nforeign service.”  Truly, it would seem, from these various disputes all\r\noccurring within less than the first half of the 13th century, {147}\r\nthere must have been something in the atmosphere of Oxcombe which\r\nrendered its people peculiarly litigious.  Could the confined position,\r\nwe are almost inclined to ask, have narrowed their ideas, and, shut out\r\nas they were from the larger world beyond, the “combe,” have given them\r\nan undue sense of their own importance?\r\n\r\nA gap now occurs of many years before we find further records of this\r\nlittle lordship.\r\n\r\nAmong the Chancery Inquisitions in the reign of Richard III. and Henry\r\nVII., is one (No. 246), held at Lincoln Castle, 28 January, 1504–5, by\r\nwhich it appears that Thomas Welby, a member of another prominent\r\nLincolnshire family, who held the manor of Halstede, in Stixwould, in\r\nthis neighbourhood, and manors or lands in nearly 30 other parishes in\r\nvarious parts of the county, had lands in Oxcomb, and the adjoining\r\nRuckland.  He, by charter, granted these possessions to Edward Burgh,\r\nknight, George Taylbois, knight, and others, to administer his will, on\r\nbehalf of his son and heir, Thomas Welby, then of the age of 16.\r\n(“Architect. Soc. Journal,” 1895, p. 68.)\r\n\r\nAfter the dissolution of the monasteries, in the following reign, the\r\nlands connected with the priories of Sempringham and Bullington, in\r\nOxcombe, would pass into other hands, and accordingly we find new names\r\namong the owners.  By will, dated 14 June, 1535, John Gedney, of Bag\r\nEnderby, Esquire, leaves lands in Bag Enderby, Oxcombe, Winceby, Langton,\r\nand Somersby, to his sons John and Andrew, a witness to the will being\r\nGeorge Musgrave, parson of Oxcombe.  Oxcombe evidently fell to the share\r\nof the latter of these two sons, since a few years later, Andrew Gedney\r\nof Bag Enderby {148} (in 1562) presented Robert Brown to the benefice of\r\nOxcombe, vacated by the death of Roger Barry, (“Architect. S. Journal,”\r\n1897, p. 8.)\r\n\r\nThe tenure of the Gedneys, however, in due course went “the way of all\r\nflesh.”  They had apparently inherited considerable property from the old\r\nfamily of the Crevecœurs, already mentioned.  They had made good\r\nconnections, this Andrew himself having married Dorothy, daughter of Sir\r\nWilliam Skipwith, of South Ormsby, but they probably got into\r\ndifficulties at the time of “the Lincolnshire Rising” in 1536, in which\r\nAndrew was involved.  In 1579, Andrew Gedney sold Oxcombe Grange to John\r\nCopledyke, who obtained Queen Elizabeth’s pardon for making the purchase\r\nwithout her license, which was then required by law, as a royal\r\nprerogative and source of revenue; and the following is the next notice\r\nwe find of the family:—By will, dated 1 April, 1613, Richard Gedney, of\r\nBag Enderby, Esq., leaves 10_s_. to the poor of Oxcombe; but William\r\nMorton, of Oxcombe, and Thomas Cheales of Hagworthingham, are requested\r\nto manage his manor of Oxcombe, and pay his debts out of it.  This was\r\nthe beginning of the end, and the Gedneys in due course disappeared from\r\nthe landed gentry of Lincolnshire.  The name, for a time, revived in the\r\nsecond half of the 19th century, in the person of a relative of the\r\npresent writer, who owned Candlesby Hall, but it was only “a flash in the\r\npan,” and they are gone.\r\n\r\nAnother name now comes to the fore.  Henry VIII. granted extensive lands,\r\nwhich had been connected with the rich monasteries, to Charles Brandon,\r\nDuke of Suffolk, who was grandson of William Brandon, standard bearer to\r\nHenry VII., who was slain at the battle of Bosworth.  The Duke died\r\nleaving two sons by his 4th wife, Catherine, who was daughter and heiress\r\nof the Lord Willoughby d’ Eresby of that day.  (Dugdale “Baronage,” ii.,\r\n300.)  These both died of “the sweating sickness,” while quite young, and\r\nthereupon the descendants of Sir William Brandon’s daughters were\r\ndeclared to be the heirs.  One of these, Eleanor, married John Glemham,\r\nof Glemham Parva, Co. Suffolk.  Their descendants, by marriage, or\r\notherwise, acquired the manors of Burwell, Calceby and Mareham-le-Fen,\r\nand at later periods, lands in Goulceby, Donnington-on-Bain, Belchford,\r\nWalmsgate, Fairforth, and several other parishes, and in 1641, Sir Thomas\r\nGlemham sold most of these to Matthew Lister, Esq., of St. Martins-in-the\r\nFields, Co. Middlesex; among the lands then disposed of, Oxcombe is named\r\nwith the above neighbouring parishes, though we do not find it specified\r\nbefore.  It is supposed that Sir Thomas, who was a warm supporter of the\r\nunfortunate King Charles I., effected this sale in order to aid his\r\nsovereign.  Be that as it may, Oxcombe passed from the Glemhams to the\r\nListers.  For nearly 200 years this family continued to hold the bulk of\r\nthis property, but, in their turn, the Listers also fell upon evil times,\r\nand their estates gradually came under the hammer.  The patronage of the\r\nbenefice was vested in the Langtons, of Langton-by-Spilsby, in 1677,\r\n1717, and 1762 (Liber Regis), and, according to Noble’s “Gazetteer,” also\r\nas late as 1833, and they were probably owners in part, of the soil.  In\r\n1799, John Grant died lord of the manor, and three members of his family\r\nheld it in succession.  In 1842, the benefice was held jointly with that\r\nof Belchford, by the Rev. Egremont Richardson, B. Grant, Esq., being\r\npatron.  Since then it has been held singly by three successive\r\nincumbents, the Rev. John Chalmers, the Rev. Goulding Saunders, and the\r\nRev. James Clarke, but since 1898 the two have been again held together\r\nby the Rev. R. H. Domenichetti.  In 1863, David Briggs, Esq., was lord of\r\nthe manor.  On his death, in 1876, it was bought by T. Ross, Esq., who\r\ndied in 1885, when it was again sold to the late Spedding Whitworth,\r\nEsq., of Wath-upon-Dearne, Co. Yorke, whose son, Harrie Whitworth, is the\r\npresent owner.  The whole parish is now occupied and farmed by Mr. Henry\r\nMeanwell, who resides in the manor house, a substantial residence, built\r\nin Elizabethan style, in 1845–6, surrounded by extensive grounds,\r\nwell-kept, and a well-wooded park of some 50 acres.\r\n\r\nThe Church, dedicated to All Saints, is a small brick structure,\r\nadjoining, to the east, the manor house grounds.  It was restored in\r\n1884, by T. Ross, Esq., the then owner of the manor, in the decorated\r\nstyle.  It consists of nave, and chancel, with apsidal east end.  Over\r\nthe west door rises an octagonal turret of stone, containing one small\r\nbell.  The pulpit and sittings are of good old oak, with nicely carved\r\npoppy heads.  Near the pulpit is an old-fashioned square family pew.  The\r\nnorth and south walls of the nave have each a couple of two-light\r\ntrefoiled windows.  The font is octagonal, the faces trefoiled, with\r\nplain shields in each face, the shaft octagonal, standing on a pediment\r\nof two steps.  The chancel arch is peculiar as being remarkably low.\r\nThere are good carved oak altar rails, and a modern east window of three\r\nlights.  On the south wall of the chancel is a tablet in memory of John\r\nGrant, the former lord of the manor, who died in 1799.  The inscription\r\nformerly stated that he had made “£100,000 by farming, which had never\r\nbeen done before,” but this latter part is now erased.  On the north wall\r\nis a tablet to Thomas Grant, who died in 1810; also to William Grant, who\r\ndied in 1817.  In the churchyard is a Grant altar tomb and vault; also\r\ntwo tombs of grey granite, in memory of Thomas Ross, and his wife Anne;\r\nalso a tomb of David Briggs, Esq., former owner of the manor, who died,\r\nApril 1st, 1876, and two others of Benjamin Briggs, and another David\r\nBriggs.\r\n\r\nThis sequestered place is approached by a road, worn, probably by usage\r\nthrough long ages, to a depth of several feet below the ordinary level of\r\nthe ground, the high banks on each side of it being covered with\r\nneatly-trimmed shrubbery, and the whole has the appearance of a\r\nwell-cared-for estate, all the buildings being substantial and in\r\nexcellent order.  Some of the fields still retain names which tell of\r\nby-gone ages.  To the north are fields named “Scotland Deepdales,” and\r\n“Scotland Walk,” which may possibly refer to the old parochial taxation,\r\n“Scot and Lot” (Saxon, sceat and lot), which was levied upon all subjects\r\naccording to their ability, for the poor, church expenses, village\r\nwatchman, &c., the right of voting for members of parliament and other\r\nofficials, being vested in those who paid “scot and lot.”  One field is\r\nnamed “Mill Walk,” indicating where the manorial lord once had that\r\nvaluable source of revenue, the mill, at which all the bordars and\r\nvilleins were bound to have their corn ground.  One part of the ground is\r\nnamed “Groves’ Walk,” a plantation so-called from a poacher, Groves, who\r\nwas shot in a night skirmish many years ago.  In a wood in the Farford\r\ndirection, adders are said to have been numerous.  There is an extensive\r\npasture named the “Intake,” probably recording its first inclosure from\r\nthe common land.  Two arable fields are called the “Near” and “Far”\r\n“Gaire”; gaire, garing, or geira, being a very ancient term for a section\r\nof land ploughed in a different direction from the rest, as these are\r\nstill at the present time.  While ploughing a part of this manor in the\r\nyear 1818, a labourer found a small silver casket, containing 46_s._ of\r\nthe early part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, which were scarcely\r\ninjured by the lapse of time.  (“Hist. Linc.,” by J. Saunders, vol. ii.,\r\np. 177.)\r\n\r\nAltogether, this parish of some 5 houses, and less than 40 inhabitants,\r\nforms a very interesting little estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAITHBY.\r\n\r\n\r\nRaithby is situated about 2 miles from Spilsby and about 9 miles from\r\nHorncastle, on the main road between the two towns, _via_ Hagworthingham.\r\nIt is within the ancient soke of Bolingbroke, and an appanage of the\r\nDuchy of Lancaster.  There is a post and money order office, and letters,\r\n_via_ Spilsby, arrive at 7.5 a.m., and depart at 5.40 p.m.  The nearest\r\ntelegraph office is at Spilsby.  Not much of the early history of this\r\nparish is to be found.  As is stated in the notes on Mavis Enderby, these\r\ntwo parishes were closely connected, land in both being held by the\r\nSaxon, Elnod (Domesday Book), also, in early Norman times, by William de\r\nKarilepho, the powerful Bishop of Durham, and by the Conqueror’s\r\nfavourite, Ivo Taillebois, who, from the vast possessions which he\r\nacquired through his wife, the Lady Lucia, seems to have verily suffered\r\nfrom the disease of “land hunger.”  Rather later, Eudo, son of Spirewic,\r\nthe founder of the Tattershall family, held lands in Raithby, as well as\r\nat Mavis Enderby.  In the reign of Edwd. I. (1402), the manor and\r\nadvowsons of Raithby and Mavis Enderby were held by Robert de Willoughby,\r\nancestor of the present Lord Willoughby.  The descendants of Ivo\r\nTaillebois seem to have retained at least some of their property in\r\nRaithby for a longer period than they did in some other parishes, as we\r\nfind that “Thomas Tailbus” of Raithby, by will, dated 7 March, 1556,\r\nrequested that he might be buried “in our Lady’s Choir.”  He states that\r\nhe made his will while “mighty of mind, whole of witt and understanding.”\r\nHe makes his wife, Johan, executrix, and desires her to give to their son\r\nRoger, and Agnes Harper (presumably a married daughter), “as much as may\r\nbe conveniently spared.”  (“Lincolnshire Wills,” by Canon Maddison).\r\n\r\nThe pedigree of the Taylbois’ of Raithby is given in the Visitation of\r\n1562.\r\n\r\nAgain, by will, dated 5 March, 1579, John Taylboys, of Raithby, gent.,\r\ndesires that he may be buried in the church.  He leaves everything to his\r\nwife, except 10_s._ to his mother, and William Thompson and “Wil\r\nCockson,” executors are to pay £12, “bequeathed by my father to sexe\r\nchildren.”\r\n\r\nThe Littleburies had also land in Raithby; since by will, dated 1 Sep.,\r\n1568, Humphrey Littlebury, of East Kirkby, left land at Raithby, and\r\nother places, to his son, John Littlebury, and John Littlebury of\r\nHagworthingham, by will, dated 28 Sep., 1612, left his lands at Raithby\r\nto his son John.  As I mention in the notes on Salmonby, the Littlebury\r\nfamily were originally located in the Holbeach neighbourhood; Robert and\r\nhis ancestors held land there, and at Whaplode, of the abbots of Croyland\r\nlong before the reign of Edw. III.  But he began to get in arrear with\r\nhis rent, as shewn by the following list of omissions recorded against\r\nhim:—\r\n\r\n                                                     £      s.      d.\r\nFor his own and his men’s table with the            40       0       0\r\nabbot of Croyland\r\nFarms of tithes in Whaplode                          9       0       0\r\nDenariis mutuo receptis (_i.e._ money               12       0       0\r\nborrowed)\r\nSeveral horses borrowed and not returned             4       0       0\r\nOther items are given as a set off, as well         40       0       0\r\nas his legacy of\r\nBut there still remains a debt of                   60       0       0\r\n\r\nThis was a large sum in those days.  But John Littlebury gave the abbot\r\n“diverse jewels” in payment of this debt.  (Appendix to Cough’s\r\n“Croyland,” from the Abbey register.)\r\n\r\nSir Martin Littlebury was Chief Justice of England, A.D. 1243.  His wife\r\nwas Anne, daughter of Sir Henry Rochford.  They intermarried with several\r\nother families of position and influence.  Their pedigree is given in the\r\nHerald’s Visitation of Lincolnshire, in 1562–64, coming down to Humphrey\r\nLittlebury, of Stainsby, named above, as holding land in Raithby.\r\n(“Notices on Holbeach,” by G. W. McDonald).\r\n\r\nBy will, dated 4 March, 1599, Anne Skipwith, of Hanney, left legacies to\r\nThomas and Robert Raithby, and this patronymic is not uncommon in the\r\nneighbourhood still.\r\n\r\nIn later years the manor of Raithby was the property of the\r\nBrackenburies, who had a handsome residence, Raithby Hall, which was, in\r\n1848, purchased by the Rev. E. Rawnsley, who is now lord of the manor.  A\r\ncurious circumstance connected with the Hall is that during the time when\r\nit was owned by Mr. Robert Carr Brackenbury, he, being a friend of John\r\nWesley, granted him the use of the hay loft for religious services, and\r\nsubsequently by will provided that all future owners of the property\r\nshould fulfil this condition, and these services are still occasionally\r\nheld there, so that we have now the anomaly of the Hall being owned and\r\noccupied by a clergyman of the church of England, while the loft over his\r\nstables is used by a Wesleyan minister.\r\n\r\nThe benefice formerly paid a pension to the abbots of Croyland of £1\r\n6_s._ 8_d._  At the Reformation the tithes were seized by “the Merry\r\nMonarch,” and the patronage of the benefice now belongs to the crown.\r\nThe late Geo. Walker, Esq., of Offord House, Spilsby, owned an estate in\r\nthis parish, also Admiral Buckle, who now resides at Gunby Hall.  There\r\nis a free school here for the poor children of Raithby, Mavis Enderby,\r\nHundleby, and Sausthorpe, founded and endowed by Thomas Lawford, in 1683,\r\nand besides his endowment, the teacher has the dividend of £204 1_s._\r\n8_d._ left by Elizabeth Kirkbridge, of Hull, in 1813, and the interest of\r\n£100 left by John Dawson, in 1839.\r\n\r\nThe Church is dedicated to the Holy Trinity.  It consists of tower, nave,\r\nwith south porch, north and south aisles, and chancel.  The tower is of 3\r\ntiers, and has 3 bells.  The church was thoroughly restored in 1873, the\r\nchancel and nave wholly rebuilt, the architect being Mr. G. G. Scott.\r\nThe porch has a very curious stoup in the western corner, with 3 Norman\r\ncolumns as supports.  The north and south aisles have 3 bays, the columns\r\nbeing transitional Norman.  In the north wall is a door and two\r\nsquare-headed, perpendicular windows with coloured glass; one of these\r\nhas for its subjects St. George and St. Andrew, the other, St. David and\r\nSt. Patrick.  There is also a two-light window in the east wall of the\r\nnorth aisle.  In the south wall, west of the porch, is a coloured\r\ntwo-light window, the subjects being, above, the Good Shepherd and the\r\nPresentation in the Temple, and below, Christ blessing little children,\r\nand our Lord’s baptism.  Next to the porch, eastward, is a memorial\r\ntwo-light window to John Coleridge Kennard, the subjects being, the\r\nResurrection, and the Ascension.  The window at the east end of the south\r\naisle is a two-light one, with coloured glass, by Kemp, the subjects\r\nbeing, Works of Mercy; it was put in in memory of Mrs. Rawnsley, by\r\nfriends.  The font is modern, also the lectern and the rood screen, which\r\nis coloured red, gilt, and blue.  The east, north, and south windows in\r\nthe chancel were given by the late Mrs. Rawnsley, who lengthened the\r\nchancel to its original dimensions, and gave the screen.  The east window\r\nhas three lights, the subjects being, in the centre, the Crucifixion, in\r\nthe northern light, Gethsemane, in the southern light, the Saviour’s\r\nbaptism.  The walls of the chancel are painted with various devices.  The\r\nreredos has three compartments, the centre, showing the Crucifixion; on\r\nthe right (south), the Saviour and the Magdalen, Noli me tangere; on the\r\nleft (north), the angel appearing to Mary, Ave Maria.  Two other windows\r\nhave the following subjects:—In one, in the centre, is the Lord in glory,\r\nwith St. Michael, on the one side, St. Gabriel, on the other, by Milner;\r\nin the other, of four lights, put in by members of the Rawnsley family,\r\nin memory of their mother, the subjects are, in the lower part, one scene\r\nthroughout, the birth at Bethlehem; above, the compartments show the\r\nAnnunciation, with the Presentation and Visitation on either side.  The\r\nsouth chancel window of three lights, with coloured glass, has the three\r\nsubjects, St. Alban, St. Agnes, and St. Catherine.  There is a piscina in\r\nthe south wall of the chancel.  The material of the structure is Spilsby\r\ngreen sandstone.  The tower is of the Perpendicular period, other parts\r\nbeing a mixture of the Perpendicular, Decorated, and Transitional styles.\r\nThe church is unusually rich in coloured glass, although all of it\r\nmodern.  The benefice, a rectory, is held by the Rev. George Ward, who\r\nlives at Mavis Enderby, of which parish he is also rector.  Of the church\r\nplate, the chalice is of the date of Cromwell; the paten and former cover\r\nof chalice are of the date of Elizabeth.  A modern paten has been\r\npresented by the Rev. E. Rawnsley.  The register dates from 1558.  It\r\ncontains a note by a former rector, stating that a number of pages had\r\nbeen lost in the waste paper basket of his predecessor, but that, from\r\nother sources, he had himself supplied the deficiency.  Then follows a\r\nlong series of entries, all in one handwriting, the curious part,\r\nhowever, is that his own death is recorded in the same handwriting.  We\r\nleave it to the reader to solve this puzzle of a posthumous record.  The\r\nsandstone, which prevails generally throughout this district, disappears\r\nat Raithby, but about half-a-mile north-east of Raithby church, numerous\r\nphosphatic nodules are found scattered about the surface.  The nodule bed\r\ncan be traced across the fields to the south-west, and the phosphates lie\r\ngenerally in patches.  The hill, south of Raithby, consists of the\r\nformation known as Tealby clay, capped with chalky boulder clay, blue\r\nclay appearing on its western slope.  These clays rest upon a floor of\r\nhard calcareous ferruginous rock, full of brown oolitic grains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRANBY.\r\n\r\n\r\nRanby is situated on the old Roman road to Caistor, northward, rather\r\nmore than 7 miles from Horncastle.  The vicar, the Rev. G. S. Lee,\r\nresides at Benniworth, rather more than 3 miles distant, of which he is\r\nrector.  Letters, _via_ Lincoln, arrive at 10.30.  Ranby is probably a\r\ncontraction of Ravenby; as we have near Louth, two parishes, Ravendale,\r\neast and west, and the hamlet of Raventhorpe, in the north of the county,\r\nin the parish of Appleby, near Brigg.  Ravendale is contracted into the\r\npatronymic Randell; and so Ravenby becomes Ranby.\r\n\r\nRanby Hall, the seat of the Otter family, who have been located here and\r\nat Clayworth, Notts., more than a century, is a handsome residence in\r\nwell-wooded grounds.  One of the family was Bishop of Chichester, and\r\nanother Archdeacon of Chichester.\r\n\r\nIn Domesday Book, the manor of Ranby is reckoned among the possessions of\r\nOdo, Bishop of Baieux, who was half-brother of William the Conqueror, and\r\nEarl of Kent.  He became Bishop in 1049, and died at Palermo, on his way\r\nto the Holy Land, in 1097.  Besides being Earl of Kent, he was Count\r\nPalatine and Justiciary of England.  His abilities and his influence were\r\nso great that writers of the day described him as being, “totius Angliæ,\r\nVice-dominus sub rege.”  He was, however, too arrogant, and aspiring to\r\nthe Papacy, he was about to leave England for Rome, taking with him the\r\nwealth he had amassed, when he was apprehended by King William, and sent\r\nto prison in Normandy.  On the death of the Conqueror, he was liberated\r\nby William Rufus, but never acquired his former power, and being\r\nconcerned in a conspiracy, had to abjure the realm.  He held at one time\r\n76 lordships in Lincolnshire, besides many in other counties.  Another\r\nNorman, Ralph de St. Valery, a town in Picardy, also had a grant of land\r\nin Ranby, to the extent of 360 acres with 14 socmen holding 7 oxgangs,\r\nand 2 bordars with 240 acres between them.  A Saxon thane, Godric, had\r\nsome 604 acres.  The church had a resident priest, owning a mill, worth\r\n10_s._ 8_d._ a year, and 270 acres of meadow.  At a later date, Ranby was\r\nan appanage of Tupholme Abbey. {156a}\r\n\r\nThe Church, dedicated to St. German, stands on an elevation, and would be\r\na conspicuous object for several miles, but that it is embowered in lofty\r\ntrees. {156b}  It was restored in 1839 at the expense of Miss Alice\r\nOtter, who also presented three bells; and it was further improved in\r\n1862, when the tower was incased with new stone, and the chancel\r\nre-built.  The old chancel arch was at that time removed, and now forms\r\nthe arch under the tower, the stone having been re-chiselled.  The tower\r\nis massive, with four pinnacles, having two-light flamboyant windows in\r\neach face, and small lancet windows below them, in the west and south\r\nsides.  In the north wall of the nave, there is one two-light flamboyant\r\nwindow, and in the south wall, two similar ones.  A small north transept\r\nforms a vestry, in the west wall of which are preserved some small arches\r\nfrom an earlier fabric, and in its north wall is a two-light flamboyant\r\nwindow.  In the north chancel wall there is a small one-light window.\r\nThe east window has three lights with three trefoils above, and in the\r\nsouth chancel wall there is a two-light window with trefoil above.  All\r\nthe chancel windows have coloured glass.  The south window is a memorial\r\nof Francis Otter, of Clayworth.  The subject of the east window is the\r\nAscension.  The pillars of the new chancel arch have richly-carved\r\ncapitals.  The sittings are of plain oak.  The font is octagonal, with\r\nplain shields and other devices on the faces.  There is a Walesby tablet\r\non the south wall of the nave, and large Walesby monuments in the\r\nchurchyard.  Weir, in his “History of Lincolnshire,” mentions a large\r\nancient tumulus as being near the church. {157a}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVESBY.\r\n\r\n\r\nRevesby is situated about 7½ miles from Horncastle, in a south-easterly\r\ndirection; some 12 miles north-west from Boston, 8 miles south-west from\r\nSpilsby, and about 7 miles East, from the nearest railway station at\r\nTattershall.  Letters, _via_ Boston, arrive at 7 a.m.  The nearest\r\ntelegraph office is at Mareham-le-Fen.  One derivation of the name\r\nRevesby is from a Danish word meaning a “fox,” the Danes certainly at one\r\ntime settled extensively in this neighbourhood, and “by” is a very common\r\nDanish termination.  (Streatfeild “Lincolnshire and the Danes.”)  Another\r\nand perhaps more likely derivation is from the “reeve,” or public\r\nguardian of the fen, {157b} who might well reside here, to look after the\r\nmeans of communication, roads and channels in the great tract of country\r\nsouthward, which was at one time almost a waste of morass, and subject to\r\nfrequent inundation from the sea, and in connection with this, it may be\r\nmentioned that one of the recognised duties of religious houses, {158a}\r\nsuch as the Abbey of Revesby, was to keep roads and bridges in proper\r\nrepair, and a portion of the Revesby property, named Stickney Wydale, was\r\ngranted to the abbey, on condition that the monks kept in proper order\r\nthe “Northdyke Causeway,” then a main road raised above the floods.\r\n{158b}  And among the charters and deeds of Revesby, is one (No. 7_b_),\r\nby which William de Romara undertakes to compel the men of Holland to\r\nkeep in repair a waggon-road from Sibsey. {158c}\r\n\r\nThe history of Revesby at that period is lost to us.  No Saxon chronicles\r\nexist, as they do as regards some other places, to tell us of those early\r\ndays.  Yet we can, in a degree, connect Revesby with a great Saxon\r\nfamily, and one which is represented by a leading family in our county in\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\nThe Abbey of Revesby was founded by William de Romara, A.D. 1143. {158d}\r\nHe was the son of Roger de Romara, who married (about 1093), as her 2nd\r\nhusband, the lady Lucia, who was daughter and heiress of Thorold, of\r\nBuchenale (now Bucknall in this neighbourhood), Sheriff of Lincolnshire,\r\nand that family survives now in Sir John C. Thorold, of Syston Hall, near\r\nGrantham.  The family of Thorold, or, as it was spelt at that time,\r\nTurold, was even then old and distinguished.  He was the brother of the\r\nLady Godiva, of Coventry fame, wife of Earl Leofric, and mother of Earl\r\nAlgar, and descended, according to Camden (“Britannia”, p. 474), and\r\nothers, {158e} from the Saxon Earl, Egga (and Morcar), who flourished in\r\nthe 8th century.  The first husband of Lucia, was Ivo Taillebois, of\r\nAnjou, who came over with the Conqueror, as the leader of his Angevin\r\nauxiliaries.  After the death of the brave young Saxon nobles, Edwin and\r\nMorcar, brothers-in-law, of King Harold, who refused to submit to the\r\nNorman yoke, their sister, the Lady Lucia, became entitled to all their\r\npossessions, and therefore was an heiress worth securing; and, much\r\nagainst her wish, the Conqueror bestowed her upon his favourite, Ivo\r\n(A.D. 1072).  With her, this Ivo acquired, among much other property, the\r\nmanors of Revesby and East Kirkby.  We find the first mention of Revesby,\r\nin Domesday Book (A.D. 1085), as follows:—“In Churchebi and Resuesbi\r\nthere are 12 carucates (or about 1440 acres) of land, rateable to gelt;”\r\n{159} the land is 12 carucates; 54 sokemen and 14 villeins have these 12\r\ncarucates.  Ivo has 1 carucate (in demense) and 2 churches, and 180 acres\r\nof meadow land.  The whole manor, with all that belongs thereto, is 6\r\nmiles long and 6 miles broad.  Turold was Lord of Spalding, and his\r\ndaughter Lucia, and conjointly her husband, Ivo, founded the Priory of\r\nSpalding.  But Ivo, by his acquisitions, became so great a tyrant, to all\r\nconnected with him, that he was eventually outlawed by King Rufus, and\r\nbanished the kingdom.  He fled to Anjou.  After a time he was allowed to\r\nreturn to his wife, the Lady Lucia, who was holding her court at\r\nSpalding; but, to her great relief, he shortly afterwards died of\r\nparalysis, and, writes the chronicler, Peter de Blois, “hardly had one\r\nmonth elapsed after his death, when she married that illustrious young\r\nman, Roger de Romara, and lost all recollection of Ivo Taillebois.”\r\nTheir son, William, was created first Earl of Lincoln, and, following the\r\nexample of his mother at Spalding, he gave certain lands to the monks of\r\nRiveaux, Co. York, to found a Cistercian Abbey, the lands aforesaid being\r\nall Revesby, Thoresby and Sithesby, and, as certain portions of Revesby\r\nwere held by another lord, he effected an exchange, by giving land\r\ncommensurate in Miningsby, and by a similar process of exchange, secured\r\nother further portions, so as to bring the abbey estates into what would\r\nnow be termed “a ring fence.”  We have not space to go to any extent into\r\nthe history of the abbey.  The original charter describes the property as\r\n“totam terram de Revesbiâ, et Thoresbiâ, et Schichthesbiâ.”  Of the two\r\nchurches, one, that of Thoresby, was at the time held by a priest named\r\nIvo, in exchange for which the Earl William, gave him the church of East\r\nKirkby, and appurtenances.  This church probably stood on a site of the\r\npresent church of St. Lawrence, at Revesby.  (Howlett’s “Lincolnshire,”\r\nAllan’s “Hist. Linc.”)  The other church, of St. Sythe, was doubtless in\r\nthe southern part of the present park, which has retained the name of\r\nSithesby, or St. Scythe’s until recent times.  The abbey itself was to\r\nthe south-east of the present church, at some quarter-of-a-mile distance,\r\nand of considerable dimensions, covering some acres of ground.  From a\r\nlecture, given by the late Right Honble. Edward Stanhope, we gather that\r\nthe abbey church, built of Ancaster stone, was at least 240ft. long, and\r\nover 60ft. wide, with many graceful pillars supporting its roof.  The\r\nchoir was of unusual form, extending some distance down the nave.  Beyond\r\nit, discovered in making excavations in 1869, 70, was the tomb of the\r\nfounder, having this inscription: HIC JACET IN TUMBA WIELLIELMUS DE\r\nROMARE, COMES LINCOLNIÆ, FUNDATOR ISTIUS MONASTERII SANCTI LAURENTII DE\r\nREIVISBYE. {160}  Near this were tombstones inscribed to William de\r\nRomara, son of William, Earl of Lincoln, who died before his father, and\r\nof William de Romara, son of Lucia, Countess of Lincoln.  Three bodies\r\nwere discovered and re-buried a short distance from this spot, being\r\ndoubtless those of the founder and his two sons.  In his later years,\r\nWilliam de Romara himself became a monk, and requested to be buried\r\n“before the high aulter;” and the site is now marked by a granite stone,\r\nplaced here in 1890, by the late Right Honourable Edward Stanhope.  The\r\nAbbey field, approached by a broad causeway, on the north side, more than\r\n250 yards long, has traces of four mounds, at different points, probably\r\nfor outlook and defence.  One of these, stands in an enclosure to the\r\nwest, called Saffron Garth, doubtless the favourite resort of the monks,\r\nwho were skilled gardeners; an enclosure on the other, north side, of the\r\nroad, opposite this “garth,” is called “Paradise,” supposed to have been\r\nthe orchard.  Fish ponds, to supply the monks with their ascetic diet,\r\nare to be traced in various parts around.  At Medlam, to the south-east,\r\nare the remains of a chapel or oratory.  The abbot’s private residence\r\nstood in the present park, and some of the outbuildings of his\r\nestablishment remained until recent years, near the later mansion of the\r\nproprietors of Revesby.\r\n\r\nWe will now give a few peculiar extracts from some of the deeds connected\r\nwith the abbey.  Most of these, until late years, were in the possession\r\nof the Marquis of Exeter, at Burghley House, Stamford, whose ancestors,\r\nas will be shewn hereafter, once held the property, and in 1881 they were\r\npresented to the Right Honble. E. Stanhope, by his lordship.\r\n\r\nIn celebration of the foundation of the Abbey, William de Romara\r\n“manumitted,” or released from serfdom, any of his villeins and\r\ndependants who would accept their freedom, “to go where they chose, and,\r\nif they remained on the estate, to give them land instead.”  Among those\r\nwho accepted freedom, were William Medicus, or the Doctor, and Roger\r\nBarkarius, a name still known in the neighbourhood. {161}  The witnesses\r\nto the deed of liberty were Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln, William\r\nArchdeacon, William Chancellor, and others.\r\n\r\nBy deed No. 8, William gives land in Stickney, and services due to him,\r\nfrom Alan of Stickney and his successors, to which Alan agrees; the money\r\nto be spent on wine for the “Masses” of the Abbey services.\r\n\r\nTo one deed (No. 20), for conveyance of pasturage for 20 cattle, 20 pigs,\r\nand 100 sheep, the witness is Thorold, Dean of Horncastle, a scion,\r\ndoubtless, of the family of the Lady Lucia.  He is further designated as\r\n“Magister Willelmus Novi Operis,” _i.e._ of Newark.\r\n\r\nBy deed 24, Matilda daughter of Roger de Huditoft (Huttoft) widow of\r\nWilliam of Stickney gives half a bovate of land in Stickney “in the time\r\nof my widowhood” _i.e._, when the property became at her own disposal.\r\nThe witnesses are two women, Christiana, wife of Henry de Claxby, and\r\nEda, wife of Richard, priest of Mareham; not, therefore, a celibate.\r\n\r\nBy deed 27, Alan Smerehorn of Kirkby (East) gives a sedes molendini,\r\n_i.e._ a water mill and premises, with right to draw water through his\r\nland from Bolingbroke and Kirkby.\r\n\r\nBy deed 30, Hamelinus de Jherdeburcg (Jerburg) gives land in Stickney,\r\n“quam tenui de hospitalibus de Jerusalem in terretorio de Stickenei”\r\n_i.e._ which he had held of the monks of the Hospice of Jerusalem in\r\nStickney, there having been a minor religious house there; of which\r\nRobert Picha is named as Preceptor in another Deed (25), temp. Henry II.\r\n\r\nBy a charter of Richard I. (Dugdale V. 456) the abbots are confirmed in\r\nthe possession of lands in Toynton, the grange of Toft (still existing)\r\nFulsby, lands in Miningsby, Kirkby, Claxby, Mareham, Tumby, Hameringham,\r\nWood Enderby, Skegness, and many other parishes.\r\n\r\nBy deed No. 41, William, son of Roger de Bikinghesbi gives land in\r\nMiningsby for gate alms, _i.e._ to relieve beggars at the Abbey-gate, the\r\nmonks being the great, and almost only, friends of the suffering and\r\nneedy.\r\n\r\nBy deed No. 50, Ranulph, Earl of Chester, gives to the Abbey “his servant\r\nRoger, son of Thoreword of Sibsey, with all his property and chattells.”\r\nHere the man himself is treated as part and parcel with the chattells.\r\n\r\nBy deed 69, Gaufrid of Kirkby gives certain lands “ad chorum ecclesiæ\r\naspergendum et decorandum,” _i.e._ for washing and decorating the choir.\r\n\r\nDeed 75 conveys to the Abbey another servant, Radulph, son of Gamel the\r\nPalmer, with goods and chattells.  The father here mentioned had\r\nevidently made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.\r\n\r\nDeed 78 gives to the Abbey “the homage of Gaufrid Le Neucume of Stickney\r\nand all his service.”  Here, (temp. Henry III.) is one of the family of\r\nNewcome, or Newcomen, who, centuries later, became connected by marriage\r\nwith the Banks family, in the person of the grandfather of Sir Joseph\r\nBanks.\r\n\r\nBy No. 108, Hugo de Lindsey gives one selion of land to maintain one\r\ncandle burning before the altar of the blessed Virgin in the Chapel of\r\nSt. Lawrence, (temp. Henry III. or Ed. I.)\r\n\r\nBy No. 115, William of Stickney gives land for the maintenance of candles\r\nto be kept burning in the Abbey church, one before the altar of the\r\nblessed Virgin, in honour of St. Margaret, and the other at the altar of\r\nSt. Nicholas, in honour of St. James the Apostle.\r\n\r\nBy No. 141, the Abbot leases land in Wilksby (A.D. 1344) to John\r\nHardegray, who is to pay “unum granum piperis” (pepper corn rent),\r\nannually at Christmas.\r\n\r\nBy No. 144, the Abbot and Convent grant to Richard Cave of Stickney\r\ncertain land on payment of 8 silver pence annually.  (2 Hen. V. Jan. 25,\r\n1415.)\r\n\r\nThen follows finally at the Dissolution, deed No. 150A, by which John,\r\nAbbot of Revesby, and the convent, grant (Nolentes Volentes) to Charles\r\nBrandon, Duke of Suffolk, and his heirs, and assigns, the office of chief\r\nsteward of the manors, lands, etc., of the Abbey, with an annuity of £26\r\n3_s._ 8_d._  (Harleyan Charter, 44, Brit. Mus.)\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of the end.  The monks, who, with all their\r\nfaults, had preserved for us our Bibles, had been the great patrons of\r\nlearning, the friends of the poor, the teachers of agriculture, who had\r\nmaintained our bridges and our roads, were forced to accept pittances\r\nsmaller than those they had, on a generous scale, dealt out to thousands\r\nof others.  To Charles, Duke of Suffolk, were granted the Abbey estates\r\nin 1539.  He died in 1545, and was buried at Windsor.  His two sons both\r\ndied in one day, July 16th, 1551, at the Bishop of Lincoln’s house at\r\nBuckden.  The Dukedom descended to the Marquis of Dorset, who had married\r\nthe half-sister of Charles.  The estates were divided, in 1552, among the\r\ndescendants of Sir William Brandon.  They were Sir Henry Sidney, Knight;\r\nThomas Glemham, Esq.; John Carsey, Esq.; and Francis his son by Margaret\r\nhis wife, sister to Charles Brandon; Christian Darnell, widow; Walter\r\nAyscoughe, Esq.; and Henry Ayscoughe his son by Elizabeth his wife; and\r\nJohn Tyre, gentleman, and Elizabeth his wife.\r\n\r\nJohn Carsey (also spelt Kersey) had the Revesby estate, Wilksby and Wood\r\nEnderby, and resided at Revesby.  His son Francis probably resided at\r\nSouth Ormsby, and in 1575, the father and son jointly sold the estate to\r\nThomas Cecil, Lord Treasurer Burleigh.  The property then descended,\r\nthrough the 1st and 2nd Earls of Exeter, and Elizabeth, wife of Thomas\r\nHoward, Earl of Berkshire, to Henry Howard.  He dying without male issue,\r\nwas succeeded by his nephew, Craven Howard, in 1663.  Craven Howard built\r\na mansion here.  But the entire property was sold in 1714 to the Banks\r\nfamily for £14,000, by his representatives the daughters of Henry Howard.\r\n{164}  The last of the Banks family was Sir Joseph Banks, well known for\r\nhis enclosure of the Fens and other works of public utility in the\r\ncounty, his patronage of science in every form, and his voyages of\r\ndiscovery.  He died in 1820, and, by his will, most of the estates were\r\nbequeathed to Col. the Honble. James Hamilton Stanhope, who served in the\r\nPeninsular War, and at Waterloo, other portions being left to Sir Henry\r\nHawley and his heirs, “with remainder to Sir Edward Knatchbull” (who\r\nmanaged the estates for his widow, Lady Banks).  (Weir’s “Hist. Linc.”\r\nvol. i., p. 414, Ed., 1828; “Saunders’ Hist.” vol. ii., p. 113).  He held\r\nthem for a very short period, and was succeeded by J. Banks Stanhope,\r\nEsq., formerly M.P. for N. Lincolnshire (in 1823), who, some years ago,\r\nsurrendered the estates to his cousin and adopted heir, the Right Honble.\r\nE. Stanhope, 2nd son of the 5th Earl Stanhope; and late M.P. for\r\nHorncastle Division.\r\n\r\nMr. Banks Stanhope greatly improved, and, indeed, may be said to have\r\nrebuilt the mansion of Revesby, from designs by the architect Burns,\r\nwhich now stands in beautiful grounds, and an extensive park, near the\r\nsite of the former residence of the abbots.  Vast sums have also been\r\nspent by him on the improvement of the estate; the rebuilding of\r\nfarmhouses and cottages, so as to make the village a model one in every\r\nway.  The Abbey, which is constructed throughout of Ancaster stone, and\r\nin the style of James I., is the repository of objects of art, of natural\r\nhistory, and of antiquarian interest, collected by Sir Joseph Banks, J.\r\nBanks Stanhope, Esq., and more recently by the Right Honble. E. Stanhope,\r\nsufficient to form a museum.\r\n\r\nA subject of interest which has not yet been noticed is two tumuli, or\r\nbarrows, in the parish, on the left hand, close to the road, and not many\r\nyards south of the Red Lion Inn.  They were considered by the antiquarian\r\nStukeley (“Itin Curios,” p. 23) to have been the burial place of two\r\nBritish kings, and probably also connected with the religious services of\r\nthe Druids.  They stand in an enclosure, the breadth of which, he says,\r\n“is 100 Celtic feet, and the length 300.”\r\n\r\nIn 1780 the northernmost of these barrows—there were formerly three—was\r\nexplored by Sir Joseph Banks, but nothing was found of any interest\r\nbeyond indications that it had been examined before, and since that time\r\nit has been levelled.  He thought, however, that it had been the site of\r\nreligious sacrifices.  In August, 1892, explorations were carried out\r\nunder the eye of the late Right Honble. E. Stanhope.  Here again there\r\nwere indications of former examination, not however to any great depth,\r\nand when the centre of the mound was reached a kind of sarcophagus, made\r\nof puddled clay, was found, from 5ft. to 6ft. in length, lying north and\r\nsouth, the sides 7in. or 8in. thick, and having an arch rising to a\r\nheight of 2½ft.; the bottom, slightly concave, rested on the original\r\nsoil, within this was black earth quite different in colour to the rest,\r\nwhich was believed to be human remains.  No bones, however, were found.\r\nBroken pieces of pottery and two old nails, were found outside this\r\nreceptacle, which were pronounced by Sir A. W. Franks, of the British\r\nMuseum, to be mediæval, and to have probably been introduced by previous\r\nexplorers.  (Account by E.S., “Linc. N. & Q.,” vol. iii., pp. 145–7.)\r\n\r\nWe have little more to say of the past history of Revesby.  When the\r\nSpanish Armada was expected to invade our shores in 1589, one of those\r\nLincolnshire gentry who subscribed £25, a large sum in those days,\r\ntowards the defence of the country, was Nicholas Saunderson of Rearsby,\r\nor Revesby; he also, at the muster at Horncastle in 1586, furnished “1\r\nlight horse”; John May of Mareham doing the same (“Architect. S.\r\nJournal,” 1894, p. 214.)\r\n\r\nAmong the old observances of Revesby was the annual fair, an occasion of\r\nmuch jovial festivity, and in the days of Sir Joseph Banks, that fine old\r\nEnglish gentleman, the Sir Roger de Coverley of his day, encouraged such\r\nold time customs, providing ale most generously for all comers, and\r\ndriving down to the village green, where the booths were arranged, with\r\nhis party in two or three coaches.  Morrice dancing and the mummers play\r\nalways had his patronage.  In these days of “_autres temps_, _autres\r\nmœurs_,” all these have gone out of vogue.  Whether the modern, _soi\r\ndisant_, more refined practices at village feasts are an improvement on\r\nthe old is a question we leave others to decide.\r\n\r\nRevesby church, dedicated to St. Lawrence, was formerly a small\r\nstructure, rebuilt in 1735, partly with materials taken from the former\r\nAbbey, by Joseph Banks, Esq. (great grandfather of the Right Honble. Sir\r\nJoseph Banks), who purchased the property from the Honble. Henry Howard,\r\n3rd son of the Earl of Berkshire, in 1714.  The benefice then, as now,\r\nwas a chaplaincy to the owners of the Revesby Abbey estate. {166}  That\r\nchurch contained among its chief features a memorial tablet at the east\r\nend of the chancel to Nehemiah Rawson, Esq., who died in 1657, a name\r\nstill common in the neighbourhood; another to the above-named Honble.\r\nHenry Howard, who died in 1663; and on the north side of the chancel was\r\na large marble monument, surmounted by a bust, and an inscription in\r\nLatin to Joseph Banks, Esq., who died 1727.  After renovation at various\r\nperiods this old fabric was removed, and, on the same site, the present\r\nhandsome church, a fine specimen of the 14th century, flamboyant style,\r\nwas erected at the joint expense of J. Banks Stanhope, Esq., and the late\r\nRight Honourable Edward Stanhope, M.P., lord of the manor in 1890–2.  The\r\nchurch consists of western tower, surmounted by a lofty spire; nave, with\r\nnorth aisle and south porch; and chancel, with organ chamber and vestry\r\non the north side; the whole forming an elegant structure, reminding one,\r\nthough on a smaller scale, of the famous marble church of Bodelwyddan in\r\nNorth Wales.  It is built generally of Ancaster stone, the walls inside\r\nbeing lined with red Hollington sandstone.  Mr. Hodgson Fowler was the\r\narchitect, and in several details of the building he reproduced features\r\nborrowed from the original Abbey.\r\n\r\nThe following is a detailed description of the church:—In the south wall\r\nof the interior of the tower, in a recess, are various carved and other\r\nfragments of stone, and near them the capitals and bases of some small\r\nNorman columns; and on the north wall is a fragment of a canopied niche;\r\nall these being carefully preserved remnants of the original Abbey\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nIn the centre is a small Norman font with plain bowl, supported on a\r\nshaft of 8 clustered columns, resting on a square base.  In the tower\r\nabove is a peal of 8 carillon bells of good tone, embracing the octave.\r\nThe north aisle has 4 lofty bays.  In the north wall are four two-light\r\nwindows with trefoil and other tracery above.  Against the west wall of\r\nthis aisle is a massive marble monument surmounted by a bust, probably\r\nthe old monument renewed, bearing in English the inscription, “In memory\r\nof Joseph Banks, M.P. for Grimsby and Totnes, born 1681, died 1727,\r\nmarried Mary Hancock, and had issue Joseph, and Mary, Lady Whichcote,\r\ndied 1726”; to the left, “Joseph Banks II., born 1695, died 1741,\r\nmarried, 1st, Annie Hodgkinson, and had issue, &c.; Eleonora (the\r\nyoungest) born 1723, died 1793, married the Honble. Henry Grenville, and\r\nwas mother of Louisa, Countess Stanhope; married, 2ndly, Catherine widow\r\nof Newcomen Wallis.”  Right inscription, “William Banks, born 1719, died\r\n1761, married Sarah Bate, and left issue, (1) Joseph, afterwards Sir\r\nJoseph Banks, (2) Sarah Sophia, born 1744, died 1818.”\r\n\r\nThe south nave wall next to the porch eastward has two two-light windows\r\nsimilar to those in the north wall, and next to the chancel wall a large\r\nthree-light window, flamboyant above, of coloured glass—the subjects\r\nbeing St. James, St. Peter, and St. John, bearing the inscription below,\r\n“Presented by the tenants of the Revesby estate as a token of esteem for\r\nJames Banks Stanhope, Esquire, of Revesby Abbey, 1892.”  The pulpit is of\r\ncarved modern oak, being Flemish work, the subjects scriptural, resting\r\non a stone base; the sittings throughout are of oak with carved panels at\r\nthe ends.  There is a good brass lectern, and oak fald-stool.  The choir\r\nstalls in the chancel are of massive carved oak with good poppy heads.\r\nThe panels of the sedilia are from the Abbot’s house; the encaustic tiles\r\nare copies of the originals, the remains of which are preserved in the\r\nbell chamber of the tower.  The east window is of five lights with rich\r\nflamboyant tracery above.  It is filled with coloured glass by Messrs.\r\nHeaton, Butler and Bayne, and erected by public subscription in memory of\r\nthe late Right Honourable Edward Stanhope.  The subjects are two rows of\r\nfigures; in the lower row, in the two lights on the north side, are St.\r\nEdward and St. Matthew, then St. Boniface and St. Wilfred; in the central\r\ncompartment, three figures, St. George, St. Martin, and St. Alban; then,\r\nto the south, St. Hugh and St. Jerome, in one light, St. Thomas and St.\r\nLawrence in the other outside light.  In the upper row, the central\r\nfigure is the Saviour, crowned, His right hand uplifted in blessing, His\r\nleft holding a sceptre; in the two compartments, on either side, are\r\nangels with harps, viols, &c.  In the tracery above are heads of angels,\r\nand above all, the Angus Dei.  The reredos is of plush velvet.  A\r\njewelled cross stands on the super-altar.  The communion table is covered\r\nwith a rich altar cloth of velvet and lace.  To the north and south of\r\nthe table, the walls are panelled with oak, to the height of the east\r\nwindow, with devices representing the ivy, olive, rose, gourd,\r\npomegranate, vine, and fig; the fruit being inlaid mother of pearl, given\r\nby the Honble. Mrs. Stanhope.  There is a brass tablet in the north wall,\r\ngiving an account of the east window.  In the south wall is a plain\r\ntwo-light trefoiled window, and a long stone seat below.  The organ has\r\nhandsome coloured pipes, and has in front a richly-carved oak screen.  At\r\nthe main entrance to the churchyard is a lich gate, “erected by friends\r\nand tenants, in loving memory of the Right Honourable Edward Stanhope.”\r\nIn the churchyard, beneath the east window, is the Stanhope grave, framed\r\nin white marble, with a recumbent cross of the same material within it.\r\nBeneath that spotless emblem of our faith, lies all that was mortal of a\r\nnoble being, a man “sans peur et sans reproche,” singularly gifted, of\r\nvaried tastes, wide sympathies, generous instincts, of indefatigable\r\nindustry as a statesman in the service of his Queen and country, and we\r\nmay add without presumption, a sincere Christian, of strong convictions.\r\nEdward Stanhope, died, 22 December, 1893, admired by his opponents almost\r\nas much as he was beloved by his friends, and of him, we may truly say\r\nthat his gain was our loss.  Opposite the village green are alms-houses,\r\nfor five poor men and five poor women, founded by Joseph Banks, Esq., in\r\n1727, who endowed them with an annual rent charge of £50.  Revesby is\r\nemphatically a model village, the residences of the tenants and their\r\nlabourers, being alike maintained in the best order.\r\n\r\nThe parsonage, a good residence, erected by J. Banks Stanhope, Esq.,\r\nstands in pretty grounds and is now adorned, internally, with much carved\r\noak furniture, cabinets, overmantel, &c., &c., and with a display of\r\nnumerous silver cups, trophies won in various competitions, by the Rev.\r\nP. O. Ashby, the active and energetic chaplain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSALMONBY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSalmonby is distant from Horncastle about five miles, in an easterly\r\ndirection, on the road to Tetford, which it adjoins.  The register dates\r\nfrom 1558, and contains some curious entries.  One is as follows:—“Helena\r\nMore, centesimo decimo ætatis anno, et undecimo die mensis Junii, Anno\r\nDom. 1638 fato succubuit, et die duo decimo dicti mensis sepulta est\r\n1638,” _i.e._, Helena More succumbed to her fate in the 110th year of her\r\nage, and on the 11th day of the month of June, A.D. 1638, and was buried\r\non the 12th day of the said month, 1638.\r\n\r\nIn the month of March, 1723, there were six burials within nine days,\r\nthree members of the same family; no cause for the mortality being\r\nmentioned.  In the following year (1724), there were ten burials, among\r\nthem being four of the name of Wait, three Ansels, and two Bartholomews.\r\n\r\nThe rector from 1710 to 1741, Rev. Henry Marshall, was also rector of\r\nFulletby, and vicar of Orby, and he was succeeded by his son in the\r\nrectory of Salmonby, who also held the benefice of Ashby Puerorum.\r\n\r\nThere are some rather peculiar field names in this parish, two Wongs, far\r\nand near, a relic of Saxon nomenclature; also Skerrills and Skerrills\r\nHolt, Bramfleets, Haverlins (Haver=oats), Dry-sykes, Rotten Fen, Wallow\r\nFarm, and Wallow Camp, and The Mires, the last four, doubtless derived\r\nfrom the character of the localities.  From a part of this boggy land in\r\nthe north of the parish, rises a spring of chalibeate water, said to\r\nresemble the properties of the Tunbridge Wells; a pulverulent blue\r\nphosphate of iron, and an earthy oxide of iron.  We do not know much of\r\nthe early history of Salmondby, the village of some Saxon thane of the\r\nname of Salmond.  The manor was apparently the property of the Saxon\r\nEarl, Harold, but William the Conqueror gave it to his nephew, Hugh de\r\nAbrincis, or Avranches, surnamed “Lupus,” or the Wolf, from his many\r\ndeeds of violence, and it was held as part of the soke of the more\r\nimportant manor, or honour, of Greetham.  In an ancient charter, found\r\namong the “Final Concords” (p. 359), it is stated that Geoffrey de\r\nBenigworth, grants to Avice, wife of William de Benigworth, his manors of\r\nWalmersty, Friskeney, Salmundesby, and Skreythesfeld (Scrafield), and all\r\nappurtenances, saving the advowson of the church of Salmundesby, which\r\nremains to Geoffrey and his heirs, and we have here an example of how the\r\ncommon labourers were regarded as little better than “goods and\r\nchattels.”  Since, herewith he grants all the villeins holding the\r\n“villeinages,” or cottages, and “all their sequels,” _i.e._, their\r\nprogeny, “to have and to hold to the said Avice all her life,” and after\r\nher decease, the manors and services were to revert to the said Geoffrey\r\nand his heirs for ever.\r\n\r\nBy will, dated 2 July, 1582 (“Lincolnshire Wills,” 1500, 1600, p. 105,\r\nNo. 285), Margaret Littlebury, late wife of Thomas Littlebury, Esq., of\r\nStainsby, in the parish of Ashby Puerorum, leaves money to the poor of\r\nSalmonby, Greetham, and other places.  This Margaret was the daughter of\r\nJohn St. Paul, of Snarford, who, like the Dymokes, the Dightons,\r\nMaddisons, Massingberds, and many other leading county families, were\r\nmixed up in the Lincolnshire Rebellion of 1536.  The Littleburies were\r\nseated at Hagg and Somersby, as well as at Stainsby, but they seem to\r\nhave resided originally at Holbeach Hurn.  Sir Humphrey Littlebury, Lord\r\nof Littlebury, was born, 1346.  He married Elizabeth, daughter and\r\nheiress of Sir John Kirton, knight, Lord of Kirton, and there is a fine\r\naltar tomb of them both, in Holbeach church.  His will was dated, Dec. 1,\r\n1330.  But there was a Sir Ralph Littlebury, knight, a juror at Holbeche,\r\nin A.D. 1293.\r\n\r\nThere would seem at one time to have been a substantial manorial\r\nresidence at Salmonby, for by will, dated 23 January, 1614, Edward King,\r\nof Ashby-de-la-Laund, devises “to my sonne, John Kinge, my manor house,\r\nof Salmondbie, _alias_ Salmonbie, with all appurtenances,” also certain\r\n“closes,” among them being the “Rush Close, Warlowe close, the Conie\r\nHill, Huntepitts, Sheepe Walks, The Lings, _alias_ Gallows Hill, Rotten\r\nFen, &c., which manor and lands were late in the tenure of Richard\r\nCaterton.”  He adds a codicil, dated “9 day of June, 1617,” bequeathing\r\nto his said sonne, John Kinge, various cottages, with his “commons of\r\nKey-gaite, and Sheepe-gait acre, and sheepe pasture in other places in\r\nSalmonbie.  Lastlie, I bequeath to my right worthie and faithful friende,\r\nSir John Meres, knight, a ring of gold of the value of xl_s._, to be\r\ninamiled on the outside, and within to be ingraven these words, Donum\r\nFidelis Amici.”  This testator built the hall at Ashby-de-la-Laund in\r\n1595.  The Kings took the side of the Parliament, and Colonel Edward King\r\ndistinguished himself.  The last male heir, the Rev. John King, died\r\nwithout issue, a few years ago.  The manor took its name from the two\r\nfamilies, Essheby and De la Laund, who held it till the reign of Henry\r\nVI.  It has belonged to the Kings since the reign of Henry VIII., but has\r\nnow passed to Colonel Neville H. Reeve.\r\n\r\nA former rector of Salmonby, Phyllip Robert, clerk, by will, dated 26\r\nJuly, 1617, but not written in a clerkly style, desired “to be buried in\r\nthe queare” (choir) of the church.\r\n\r\nBy a Chancery Inquisition (18 Henry VII., No. 46), it was found that\r\nHamon Sutton, held the manor of Salmonby, with Maydenwell and others, and\r\nalso the advowson of Salmonby, holding them of the Lord the King, as of\r\nhis Duchy of Lancaster, and in the time of Queen Elizabeth, Anthony\r\nThorold, knight, is named in certain documents still in the British\r\nMuseum, as being lord of the manor at that time.  (“Collectanea” G.\r\nHolles, vol., iii., p. 770.)\r\n\r\nIn 1415, John Kyghly, of Salmonby, a feoffe of Sir William Cromwell,\r\nknight, presented to the chantry in Driby church, because he, Sir\r\nWilliam, was “out of the realm.”  It is probable that he was with Henry\r\nV. at the battle of Agincourt, October 25, 1415.  (“Architectural\r\nSociety’s Journal,” 1895, p. 124).\r\n\r\nAmong the Revesby charters is a deed of Symon, son of Gilbert of Halton,\r\nand his wife Sarah, by which they jointly give to the Abbey of Revesby,\r\nall “their lands in Salmonby and in Scraydesfield (Scrafield), and in\r\nStickney, and all their claims on the goods of Gilbert of Benniworth.\r\nWitnesses, Gilbert Cusin, seneschal of the house of the Earl Chester, and\r\nothers.”  Date, temp. Hen. III.\r\n\r\nThe patronage of the benefice of Salmonby was at one time attached to the\r\ncrown, probably as an appurtenance of the honour of Greetham and Duchy of\r\nLancaster, but it has now passed into private hands.  In 1779, Henry\r\nMarshall, clerk, already referred to, was patron and incumbent.  Prior to\r\n1840, W. Bowerbank held the patronage and rectory.  He was succeeded by\r\nthe late Rev. Henry Fielding, formerly Canon of Manchester, next followed\r\nRev. R. F. Ward, then for a brief period, Rev. F. Cooper, and it is now\r\nheld by the Rev. John Booth, who is also patron.  It has the unique\r\ndistinction of having once been held in commendam by William Patten,\r\ncommonly known later as William Waynflete, from his birth place,\r\nWainfleet, in Lincolnshire; that most munificent divine, Provost of Eton,\r\nBishop of Winchester, Lord Chancellor, Founder of Magdalen College,\r\nOxford, and of a free school at his native place.\r\n\r\nThe church, dedicated to St. Margaret, was until recent years, an\r\nivy-mantled structure, of the period Edwd. III. but it was restored in\r\n1871, during the incumbency of the Rev. R. Fawssett Ward, at a cost of\r\nabout £600, who also enlarged the rectory, and it now forms an\r\ninteresting, well-kept and complete church, in the Perpendicular style.\r\nIt comprises nave, chancel, south porch, and small spire, which contains\r\none bell, and stands at the N.E. corner of the chancel.  The east window\r\nwas given by the late Henry James Fielding, Esq., eldest son of the\r\nformer rector, in memory of his father and mother.  It has five lights,\r\nwith numerous compartments above, and is filled with good coloured glass,\r\nthe subjects being, the Crucifixion above, and the Last Supper below, the\r\ndesign adapted from a window in the Refectory at Milan.  There is a\r\npiscina in the south wall of the chancel.  The south wall has also one\r\nthree-light, and one two-light window in the Perpendicular style.  The\r\nnave has, in the south wall, one three-light, and one two-light window,\r\nand the porch door; and in the north wall, one three-light window.  The\r\nwest window again, of three lights, has good stained glass, in memory of\r\nthe Rev. Matthewman Manduel, for more than fifty years curate or rector\r\nof Tetford; the subject is, Christ Blessing Little Children.  The tracery\r\nof all these windows is good.  There is an organ, by Nicholson, of\r\nLincoln, with nine stops, and handsome coloured pipes in front, the gift\r\nof the Rev. F. Cooper.  The chancel sedilia and choir stalls are of good\r\ncarved modern oak, by Messrs. Walter & Hensman, of Horncastle.  The nave\r\nis fitted with open benches, which, with the roof, are of pitch pine.\r\nThe font is modern, octagonal, with shields and roses floriated on\r\nalternate faces of the bowl, supported by an octagonal shaft and\r\npediment.  There is a graceful ogee arch as the priest’s entrance to the\r\nvestry.  There was formerly in the nave of the church a brass of a\r\ncivilian of the 15th century, much defaced, but it some years ago\r\ndisappeared; it is mentioned among the list of sepulchral brasses\r\nsupplied to the Archæological Institute on their visit to Lincoln in\r\n1848, so that it still existed at that date.  (“Journ. Archæol.\r\nInstitute,” 1848, p. lii, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe lady of the manor is now Mrs. Nesbitt Hamilton Ogilvy, as\r\nrepresenting the late Right Honble. Robert Adam Christopher Nesbitt\r\nHamilton, a staunch Protectionist, who was one of the eight members of\r\nParliament who voted to the last against the abolition of the corn laws.\r\nSome of the land belongs to F. S. Dymoke, Esq., and other smaller owners.\r\n\r\nAn interesting family heirloom preserved at the rectory, is a massive\r\nsilver urn-shaped cup, 13 inches high, which was presented to Major\r\nRobert Booth, great uncle of the present Rector, by the officers and\r\nprivates of the Wainfleet Infantry Volunteers, comprising three\r\ncompanies, which were raised at the time, when the first Napoleon was\r\nexpected to invade this country in 1808, and of which he was Major\r\nCommandant (Oldfield’s “History of Waynfleet” 1829).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCAMBLESBY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis rather straggling village is pleasantly situated about 6 miles\r\nnorth-east of Horncastle, in a basin of the Wolds, between the steep hill\r\non the west, by which it is approached from Horncastle and West Ashby, by\r\nthe old turnpike road to Louth, and the still steeper hill of Cawkwell, a\r\nmile further to the east, Louth-ward.  In the centre of this basin, which\r\nis watered by a small tributary of the river Bain, rising near at hand,\r\nis an almost circular prominence, like the boss of a shield, on which\r\nfitly stands the church, above all the other human erections.  Only a few\r\nyears ago, this was a very poor structure of brick, although recent\r\nexplorations have shewn that there formerly existed a fair-sized edifice,\r\nwith nave, aisles, and chancel, fragments of which were built into the\r\nlater brick structure.  This earlier church is said to have been\r\ndemolished about the middle of the 18th century.  An inscription in the\r\nwest wall of the present fabric records that “The nave of this church was\r\ntaken down, and rebuilt, A.D. 1893: Alfred Soden, Vicar; C. B. Robson, J.\r\nR. Bourne, Churchwardens.”  The chancel had been rebuilt in the previous\r\nincumbency of the Rev. T. White, by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, at\r\na cost of £400, in 1890–1.  In the reconstruction, stone was utilized\r\nfrom the small church of Cawkwell, the adjoining parish, which had been\r\ndisused and in a state of decay for some years, and was not needed for\r\nthe very small population of that parish, which is now, for\r\necclesiastical purposes, annexed to Scamblesby.  The present erection of\r\nstone has a south door, with porch, and a priest’s door in the south wall\r\nof the chancel.  The nave has north and south aisles, of three bays; the\r\neasternmost column in the south arcade is the original Norman, the rest\r\nbeing modern, in similar style.  In the north wall are three lancet\r\nwindows, the central one having two lights, the eastern and western one\r\nlight, and in the south wall there are two similar windows, one with two\r\nlights, the other with one.  The west end has two lancet windows, each\r\nwith a single light, and above them an ox-eye window, with smaller\r\nlancets on either side of it.  In the eastern wall of the nave, on either\r\nside of the chancel arch, is a narrow lancet window.  In the chancel, the\r\neast window has two lights, with quatrefoil above, two square-headed\r\nwindows in the south wall, and one in the north.  The present font is\r\nmodern, and plain; the curious, massive, circular bowl of the old font,\r\nabout 2ft. 8in. in diameter, in height more than 2ft., and with depth of\r\ninterior 1ft., large enough for immersion, stands outside the porch.  The\r\nseats of the nave are modern, of deal, but they have very good old oak\r\ncarved poppy-heads.  The pulpit, of oak, was presented as a memorial of\r\nthe late Vicar, the Rev. T. White, by his pupils; he having been formerly\r\nsecond master of the Horncastle Grammar School; it already, however,\r\nshows signs of decay.  The chancel sedilia, of deal, were given by the\r\nEcclesiastical Commissioners.  The communion table, of oak, which is\r\nraised on two steps, was the gift of the present Vicar.  In the north\r\nwall of the chancel is a tablet, commemorating, in Latin, and in quaint\r\nEnglish verse, Margaret, the daughter of Henry Coppinger, of a\r\ndistinguished family in Kent, and wife of “Franciscus Thorndike,” a lady,\r\n“imbued with a liberal piety from early years, who religiously fulfilled\r\nher conjugal duties, and who, suffering severely herself, also bore, as\r\nbecame a Christian, the loss of three children, and then, with one only\r\nsurviving, herself yielded willingly to the call of God.  Erected to a\r\nmost beloved wife, by the most sorrowing of husbands.”  No date is given,\r\nbut it has been found from the Herald’s College, that she was buried at\r\nScamblesby, Dec. 30, 1629.  (“Linc. N. & Q.” iv., pp. 208–9).  Another\r\nmember of this family, the brother of Francis, was the Rev. Herbert\r\nThorndyke, an eminent divine and worthy of Lincolnshire, Fellow of\r\nTrinity College, Cambridge, collated prebendary of “Layton Ecclesia” in\r\nthe cathedral of Lincoln, by Bishop, afterwards Archbishop, Williams (in\r\nwhich dignity he succeeded the well-known George Herbert), and later,\r\nmade a Prebendary of Westminster.  He, by his will, dated July, 3rd,\r\n1672, bequeathed his estates in this parish to the Dean and Chapter of\r\nLincoln, for the endowment of the benefice, which, like that of the\r\nadjoining Cawkwell, was a very poor one.  Thorndyke’s works form the 6th\r\nvolume of the Anglo-Catholic Library.  That the family was one of good\r\nposition, is shewn by the fact of the name of Francis Thorndyke appearing\r\nin the list of the Gentry of Lincolnshire, in 1634, as “of Scamblesby,”\r\nalso that of “Herbert Thorndyke, of Greenfield.”\r\n\r\nThe church is dedicated to St. Martin.  Among the church plate is a\r\ncommunion cup, bearing the inscription “Communion Cup, 1712,” the\r\nCawkwell cup is also old, but not dated.  The register of Scamblesby\r\ndates from 1569, that of Cawkwell from 1685, but they contain no entries\r\nof special interest.  This was one of the many possessions of the Norman,\r\nIvo Taillebois, nephew of William the Conqueror, and chief of the Angevin\r\nauxiliaries, who came over with the Conqueror.  After the death of the\r\nbrave young Anglo-Saxon nobles, Edwin and Morcar, the sons of Alfgar, and\r\nbrothers-in-law of King Harold, who refused to submit to the Norman yoke,\r\ntheir sister, the Lady Lucia, was the last of that royal line, and, being\r\nan unprotected female, William the Conqueror bestowed her in marriage\r\nwith all her many possessions, on Ivo.  He received with her, lands in\r\nGoulceby, Cawkwell, Asterby, and other places, too many to enumerate.  He\r\nwas a man of violent and tyrannous temperament, eventually, in the next\r\nreign, being outlawed as an enemy of King Rufus.  He was subsequently\r\nallowed to return to this country, but not long afterwards died of\r\nparalysis.  According to accounts, more or less authentic, the Lady, with\r\na haste which was hardly decent—though under the circumstances perhaps\r\nnot surprising—barely allowed one month to elapse (says the chronicler,\r\nPeter de Blois), “when she married that illustrious young man, Roger de\r\nRomara, son of Gerald de Romara,” who had been seneschal or steward to\r\nWilliam of Normandy, before the Conquest; two other sons, Ralph and\r\nEdward, subsequently being founders, the former, of the Tankervilles, and\r\nthe latter, of the Earls of Salisbury.  By this marriage, the large\r\npossessions of the Lady Lucia, passed to the Romaras.  Lucia herself had\r\nbeen a great benefactress to the priory of Spalding, which had been\r\nfounded by her uncle, Vice-Comes, or Sheriff, Thorold of Buchenale.\r\nAmong other gifts she conveys to the monks of Spalding “one watermill (a\r\nvaluable property in those days), and all her tithes in Scamblesby,” with\r\nmuch more in the neighbourhood.  (“Charters of Spalding Priory,” British\r\nMuseum, D. n. 5).  William de Romara, her son by her husband Roger, in\r\ndue course, following suit, founded the Abbey of Revesby.  In a later\r\ngeneration, the heiress of this family, married Gilbert de Gaunt, who\r\nthus succeeded to the large property, but it is probable that, on the\r\noccasions of each of these changes, some of the demesnes were diverted in\r\ndifferent directions, and the changes were not few, as the Gaunts were\r\nsucceeded by the Blondvilles, they by the Lacys, and they again by John\r\nof Gaunt, Earl of Richmond, 4th son of Edwd. III. whose son was King\r\nHenry IV., of Bolingbroke.  How long Scamblesby remained a part of this\r\nheritage we are not able to say, but it may be observed that in this\r\nvaried line of descent (as indeed in many others), there were various\r\ncauses for the alienation, or disintegration of large demesnes.  The\r\nSovereign’s power was absolute and most arbitrarily exercised, unless, as\r\nwas sometimes the case, the subject’s power was greater.  The owners of\r\nlarge estates, and especially heiresses, were an object of peculiar\r\ninterest to Sovereigns, who by reason of war, or their own extravagance,\r\nwere not seldom more impecunious than their powerful subjects.  The\r\nactions of the latter were carefully scanned, in order, if possible, that\r\nthe Sovereign might find an excuse for confiscation, partial or entire,\r\nof the offender’s property, and so replenish the royal coffers.  In the\r\ncase of male proprietors, they could only obtain coveted privileges, or\r\neven exercise their own undoubted rights, on the payment of a very heavy\r\nfine.  The times were turbulent, rebellion was not uncommon, and a large\r\nlandowner sometimes found that he had espoused the unsuccessful cause,\r\nwhereupon he naturally incurred the penalty.  In the case of an heiress,\r\na marriage contracted without the King’s license, was made sufficient\r\nground for the royal displeasure, and a heavy fine or deprivation was the\r\nresult.  Some, or all of these causes were at work with different members\r\nof this particular line.  In the case of the attainder of Thomas, Earl of\r\nLancaster, even his divorced wife, Alicia, became subject to a penalty of\r\n£20,000, a very large sum in those days, when pence were almost\r\nequivalent to our pounds.  In this, and other ways, the once vast\r\npossessions of the Thorolds, in this part of the county, passed into\r\nother hands; although they are still one of the leading families on the\r\nother side of it.  Other families here came to the fore.  On the\r\ndissolution of the monasteries, any property which had been granted by\r\nbenefactors to those institutions, would pass, by grant of the sovereign,\r\nto others, unless he retained it himself.  As we pass the small stream in\r\nScamblesby, over which a child could now leap, we may recognise it as a\r\npower that once turned the mill-wheel of the Lady Lucia, or ground corn\r\nfor the tenants of the priors of Spalding, but it knows their name no\r\nmore.  Some of the land, including the manor, passed to the Bishop of\r\nLincoln; until, in 1862, it was transferred to the Ecclesiastical\r\nCommissioners, who are now the Lay Impropriators; the living, now, after\r\nvarious augmentations, worth £300 a year, being in the patronage of the\r\nBishop of Lincoln, and the Earl of Yarborough.  The latter nobleman is\r\nnow one of the largest proprietors in the county, though we believe he\r\noriginally belonged to the south of England, and was connected with the\r\nEarls of Chichester, of Stanmer Park, in Sussex, in which county the\r\nheraldic Pelham buckle is a marked feature in many of the churches. {178}\r\nOther proprietors are the Lill and Bourne families.  There is a prebendal\r\nstall in Lincoln Cathedral, attached to Scamblesby in conjunction with\r\nMelton Ross, which is now held by the Rev. Canon Arthur Wright, rector of\r\nConingsby, and Rural Dean of Gartree.\r\n\r\nThere are rent charges for the poor of the parish, left by David Atkinson\r\nand dame Tyrwhitt; also the interest of £6 6_s._ 8_d._, left by an\r\nunknown donor, and a charge on land in Belchford, for poor widows.\r\n\r\nWithin a short distance of the church, in a south-eastward direction, are\r\ntraces of a moated inclosure, which has probably been the site of a\r\nresidence of some size.  Nothing is known of its past history, but it may\r\nwell have been a mansion on the property of the Countess Lucia, or some\r\nof her descendants, and occupied by a dependent vassal.  There are a few\r\nrecords of former persons connected with the parish, of which we here\r\ngive one or two.  Among the “Final Concords,” under date, 1 July, 1202,\r\nis an agreement between Roger de Maletoft, on the one part, and Philip de\r\nClaythorp, and Mary his wife, on the other part, tenants of “4 oxgangs in\r\nScamblesbi (about 60 acres),” by which they acknowledge the said land to\r\nbe the right and inheritance of the said Roger; and in return for this,\r\nhe granted it “to them and their heirs, to hold of him and his heirs for\r\never, doing for it foreign service”; and, as an acknowledgment of this,\r\nthe said Philip and Mary gave the said Roger 4 marks.  (Note appended to\r\nthe will of John Guevera, made 18 March, 1607.)  N.B.—A sister of John\r\nGuevera, married John Chapman, of Scamblesbi.  The Guevera family came\r\nfrom Biscay, in Spain, probably imported by Katherine of Arragon, or\r\nPhilip of Spain, Queen Mary’s husband.\r\n\r\nThomas Kent, of Scamblesby, clerk, by will, dated 23 July, 1623, among\r\nother bequests, leaves, “to my wife Mary, £40, with other benefits; my\r\ndau., Lydia Lent £200; my dau., Penelope Dennis, £16; my dau., Mary\r\nMartingdale, £20; my son, Thomas Kent, £20; my dau., Anne Millington,—;\r\nHenry Neave, my grandchild, £30; Gabriel Neave, my grandchild, £66 13_s._\r\n4_d._; Mary Neave, £66 13_s._ 4_d._; my son Elias Kent, 2 Kye, a pr. of\r\noxen, a pr. of 2 yr. old fleaces; a mare that I had of my son-in-law,\r\nJames Martingdale, my waines and waine-geares, and ploughs and\r\nplough-geares, my trays and harrows, also a bedd, a presse and a table,\r\nwith the lease of the manor of Scamblesby; my son, Thomas, 44_s._ in\r\ngold; my son, Abell, 44_s._ in gold; to everyone of my grandchildren,\r\n11_s._ in gold; to the poor of Donington, 22_s._; of Goulceby, 20_s._;\r\nand to the poorest of Scamblesby 20_s._; to everyone of my servants,\r\n16_d._; to Lewis Whiteing, 2 ewes and 2 lambes; to Dorothie Candroy, a\r\nflocked yearing quee.”  The testator’s wife is to have his household\r\ngoods and chattels, for division among his children at her discretion;\r\nTimothy, his son, being sole executor, to whom he bequeaths the\r\nresidence, after payment of debts and funeral expenses.  To be buried in\r\nthe chancel of Scamblesbie.\r\n\r\nElias Kent, of Scamblesby, gent., by will, dated 13 Feb., 1625, bequeaths\r\nto “my wife, Elizabeth, £200, and the household stuff, &c.; to my\r\ndaughter, Martha Kent, £200 when 16, and the lease of Scamblesby manor;\r\nto my sister, Marie Martingdale, Mr. Benjamin Storre, 20_s._; Thomas,\r\nWilliam, and Elizabeth, the three eldest children of my brother Timothy\r\nKent, deceased, 20_s._ a piece; and to Edward Kent, a new coat; to my\r\nbrother, Thomas Booth, ‘Speede’s Chronicles’; to my brother, Richard\r\nSharpe, my black gelding; to my mother, a 5_s._ piece of silver; to the\r\npoor of Scamblesby, 40_s._; to the poorest of Goulceby, 10_s._ and of\r\nDonington, 10_s._; to everie one of my sisters 10_s._; to my cosen, Alice\r\nBrooke, £3 6_s._ 8_d._, and the horse called ‘Maud,’ &c., &c.  My body to\r\nbe buried in the chancel.  My brother, Thomas Kent, clerk of Donington,\r\nto be executor.”\r\n\r\nN.B.—On the death of the said Thomas Kent, Incumbent of Donington, 13\r\nyears later, he leaves “to my much honored friend, Sir John Munson, my\r\nblack colt; to Sir Thomas Munson, my noble friend whom I much honor, my\r\nSpurr Royal; to the Right Honble., my Lord Beaumont, my bald colt; to the\r\nRectors of Donington, for the time being, and their successors for ever,\r\nmy Spalding tythes (these were the gift of the Lady Lucia to Spalding\r\npriory); to the repairs of St. Paul’s church in London, £5.”\r\n\r\nThe name Scamblesby means the “By,” _i.e._, farmstead (Scotice Byre) of\r\nthe Saxon Skamel; probably his land, amounting to six carucates (or 720\r\nacres), was that which, through the Lady Lucia, became the property of\r\nIvo Taillebois, lord of Spalding.\r\n\r\nThe parish of Cawkwell, now ecclesiastically annexed to Scamblesby, is of\r\nsmall extent, being a lordship comprising some 680 acres of land, now the\r\nproperty of the Duke of Portland; the benefice, a vicarage now valued at\r\n£39 a year, being in the patronage of the Earl of Yarborough, who, as\r\nsuch, has the alternate presentation with the Bishop of Lincoln, to the\r\nconsolidated benefice of Scamblesby with Cawkwell.  This property, again,\r\nwas among the lands of Ivo Taillebois, acquired by his marriage with the\r\nSaxon heiress, Lucia.  Little is known of its past history.  It probably\r\npassed through the like vicissitudes as Scamblesby, until it was granted\r\nto Sir Charles Cavendish, of Bolsover Castle, and from him, passed to the\r\nDukes of Newcastle, the Earl of Oxford, and finally, by the marriage of\r\nhis daughter and heiress, to the noble family of Bentinck, the ancestors\r\nof the present Duke of Portland, who, in the present generation, has\r\nmarried a lady of the almost neighbouring parish of Walmsgate.  There was\r\nformerly a priory of Cawkwell, of which Sir William Tyrwhitt was steward.\r\nIt was probably not a richly endowed institution, as his fee as steward\r\nwas only £1.  It would seem to have been a dependency of the much\r\nwealthier priory of Austin Canons, at Nocton.  (Dugdale “Monasticon,”\r\nvol. ii., p. 211)\r\n\r\nThe Church, dedicated to St. Peter, was demolished, and the materials, in\r\npart, utilized for the rebuilding of Scamblesby church, in 1893.  At the\r\ndate of Liber Regis (temp. Queen Anne), the benefice was so poor that it\r\nis there described as “not presented to,” and the church has not been\r\nused for divine worship since 1885.  Cawkwell house is a substantial\r\nresidence, standing in good grounds, and occupied by C. B. Robson, Esq.\r\nThe only thing worthy of note in connection with this parish, is that it\r\nwas the birth-place, in 1599, of a learned and pious man, Hanserd\r\nKnollys, who was educated at Cambridge, distinguished for his zeal in\r\nreligion, appointed master of the Free School at Gainsborough, took Holy\r\nOrders, and was presented by the Bishop of Lincoln to the living of\r\nHumberston.  Afterwards, conceiving scruples as to the lawfulness of\r\ncertain church observances, he resigned his benefice; for a time, with\r\nthe Bishop’s connivance, he preached in various parishes, without using\r\nthe church service.  He eventually abjured his orders, and joined the\r\nBaptist persuasion, and became one of its pastors in London.  The\r\nintolerance of the age forced him to seek refuge in Wales, Holland,\r\nGermany, and even America.  He died, Sept., 1691, in the 93rd year of his\r\nage.  (Weir’s “Hist. Lincolnshire,” vol. i, p. 301). {181}\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned Cawkwell hill.  This is one of “the Alps of\r\nLincolnshire,” and, although there are, among the Wold hills, several\r\nconsiderably steeper, being on a high road, formerly having much traffic,\r\nit has been the scene of some accidents.  Only a few years ago, a\r\ngentleman living near, was driving down the hill in a thunderstorm, when\r\nhe was struck by lightening, his carriage was upset, and his horse\r\nafterwards found on the other side of the hedge, he himself recovering\r\nwithout any serious effects.  Sometime in the forties, the late Sir Henry\r\nDymoke was driving a carriage and pair down the hill, when the horses\r\nbolted.  The father of the present writer happened at the time to be\r\nwalking down the hill, on his way home from Louth; as the horses dashed\r\npast him he made a spring at the bridle of the near horse, fortunately\r\ncatching hold of it, and by running alongside, he succeeded in bringing\r\nthe horses to a stand, without injury to anyone.  But for this timely\r\naid, the champion of England might have incurred a more serious ordeal\r\nthan that of challenging his sovereign’s enemies.\r\n\r\nThe name of this parish, “Calche uuelle,” in Domesday Book, and now\r\nCawkwell, might have been given with prophetic foresight into the future,\r\nas it is here, from a deep well, the bore of which passes through the\r\nchalk to the gravel below, that a pure and plentiful supply of water is\r\nobtained for the town of Horncastle, and more recently also for the\r\nmodern health resort of Woodhall Spa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOTBY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSotby, also in Liber Regis, called Saltby, lies to the west of Ranby,\r\nabout 2 miles to the north-west of Great Stourton, and is about 8 miles\r\nnorth-north-west from Horncastle.  Letters, _via_ Wragby, arrive at 9.30\r\na.m.  This manor, in the reign of the Conqueror, was granted by him to\r\nhis half-brother, Odo, Bishop of Baieux, {182} along with many other\r\ndemesnes, as mentioned more fully in the account of Ranby.  Ralph the\r\nvassal of Odo is mentioned in Domesday Book, as holding “4 carucates,” or\r\n480 acres, with 16 socmen and 3 villeins.  The Saxon thane, Ulnod, had\r\nabout the same extent.  The church had 150 acres of meadow.  At an\r\nInquisition, held 1 Edward II. (No. 107, 11 April, 1308), it was shewn\r\nthat Philip de Kyme, enfeoffed his son, William de Kyme, of the manor of\r\nSotteby, held by the service of half a knight’s fee.  This William, in\r\n1334, enfeoffed his nephew, Gilbert de Umfraville, of the manor.  He was\r\nEarl of Angus.  William’s widow, Joan, married as her 2nd husband,\r\nNicholas de Cantelupe, who, through her, held the manor of Baumber.\r\n(“Architect. S. Journal,” 1897, pp, 69, 70).  This Nicholas de Cantelupe,\r\nfounded a chantry in Lincoln Cathedral, dedicated to St. Nicholas.  It is\r\nsituated to the east of the great south door, under the lesser east\r\nwindow.  On the north side of this chantry, are two altar tombs, one of\r\nwhich, having a figure clad in surcoat of mail, is the sepulchre of Lord\r\nCantelupe.  In the pavement below, is a slab, in memory of his wife, the\r\nLady Joan.  She founded a small chapel on the east side of the south\r\ntransept, dedicated to St. Paul.  According to “Testa de Nevill,” Simon\r\nde Kyme, at an earlier date, held lands in Sotby, in chief from the king\r\n(circa, 1242).  (“Linc. N. & Q.,” iv., p. 174.  Compare Oldfield’s “Hist.\r\nWaynfleet,” p. 168).\r\n\r\nBy a Close Roll, 9 Henry VII., No. 30, it is shewn that Sir Robert\r\nDymmok, knt., was, with others, seized of the manor of Sotby, A.D. 1494.\r\n\r\nBy an Inquisition, taken 31 May, 1495 (10 Henry VII.), it was found that\r\nRobert Taillebois, died seized of the manor of Sotby, held from the king,\r\nby the service of half a knight’s fee.  (“Linc. N & Q.” ii., p. 141).\r\nHis ancestor, Ivo Taillebois, had lands in Baumber.\r\n\r\nThe abbot of Bardney had a pension from Sotby, as he also had from\r\nEdlington and other parishes in the neighbourhood.  At the Lincolnshire\r\nRising, in the reign of Hen. VIII., Thomas Yoell, parson of Sotby, though\r\nold and blind took a prominent part in the movement, along with the\r\nrectors of Low Toynton, Belchford, and others.  In 1798, Thomas Roe was\r\nrector.  The Rev. John Bainbridge-Smith, D.D., headmaster of the\r\nHorncastle Grammar School, held the rectory of Sotby, with that of\r\nMartin-by-Horncastle and the perpetual curacy of Baumber, from 1828 to\r\n1854; he was also Honorary Chaplain to the Duke of Newcastle.  He was\r\nsucceeded at Sotby, by his son, John Bainbridge-Smith, and the latter\r\nrebuilt the chancel of the church, St. Peter’s, and made other\r\nimprovements in 1858–9.  The register dates from 1658.  Among the entries\r\nis a record that in the year 1728, there were sixteen burials, but no\r\ncause for that excessive mortality is named.  The second Rev. J.\r\nBainbridge-Smith married a daughter of Judge Haliburton, of Nova Scotia,\r\nthe author of “Sam Slick,” “The Old Judge,” “Nature and Human Nature,”\r\n&c.  He was for some years chaplain at Smyrna.\r\n\r\nWhen the chancel was taken down in 1858, some interesting relics were\r\ndiscovered.  A sepulchral arch was opened at the north-east end, supposed\r\nto lead to the burial place of the founder of the Pre-Conquest Church.\r\nIt was constructed of grey stone.  Three very ancient windows, also of\r\ngrey stone, and blocked with rubbish, were opened, on the splays of which\r\nwere found frescoes, the figures being, so far as they remained, very\r\ndistinct.  One was a crowned figure, seated, and holding a sceptre in his\r\nleft hand, the right hand being stretched out in the attitude of judgment\r\nor command, but the lower part of the arm was wanting.  Another was a\r\nfemale figure, with long tresses, and a robe with lengthy train behind.\r\nA third, was one figure complete, probably the Saviour, with the head\r\nonly of another figure, facing him, probably the Magdalen; both heads\r\nbeing surrounded by a nimbus.  The Saviour’s attitude, with uplifted\r\nfinger, indicated the giving of some command, probably the _Noli me\r\ntangere_.  The fourth subject was apparently a rude representation of the\r\nlast supper, the Saviour being in the act of taking the cup. {184}\r\nCopies of these frescoes were made, and are preserved with the registers.\r\nThe present writer has copies, from which this description is given.\r\n\r\nWhen the south and east walls were taken down, a very ancient doorway,\r\nprobably Saxon, of grey and red sandstone was found; close beside it was\r\nanother doorway of later date.  Towards the east end of the south wall,\r\nwas found a beautiful geometrical window, the inner arch much broken.\r\nThis had apparently been the original east window, but in later times\r\nbroken up, and some of the fragments built into the wall in various\r\nparts.  All this seemed to indicate that a Saxon church had existed, that\r\nit was rebuilt about the time of the Norman Conquest, with stone found in\r\nthe neighbourhood, that in the 13th century it was adorned with frescoes,\r\nan east window, of Lincoln stone, &c.  The new chancel was re-opened by\r\nthe Bishop of Lincoln, in 1859.  (Extract from “Lincolnshire Times,”\r\nNov., 1859).\r\n\r\nThe chief features of the present church are as follows:—The font,\r\nmodern, octagonal, and plain.  A former very small font, with small bowl\r\nremains, sunk into the base of a recess in the west wall.  A small metal,\r\nportable font, is also preserved in the rectory, which was formerly used.\r\nThe chancel arch is probably Saxon.  It is very low, with massive\r\nsupports, has been mutilated, but is still in fairly good condition.  In\r\nthe south wall of the chancel is a double piscina, supposed to be\r\npeculiar to the 13th century.  In the north chancel wall is an easter\r\nsepulchre, with an aumbrey above, having a trefoil moulding in a 13th\r\ncentury arch.  The east window is modern, with three lights.  In the\r\nsouth wall is a two-light window, in memory of J. B. Smith, D.D.  In the\r\nfloor of the chancel, in the centre, is a slab commemorating John Porter,\r\nrector from 1658 to 1688–9.  In the north wall of the nave is one\r\nsquare-headed window; in the south wall are two similar windows.  On the\r\nnorth wall there is a tablet to J. Scholey.  There is only one small bell\r\nhanging in the bell turret.  Altogether this church has some very\r\ninteresting features.  In the parish chest, with the registers, is a copy\r\nmade by the late rector, of the transcripts in the Archidiaconal\r\nRegistry, dating from 1556 to 1590.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTIXWOULD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis parish is situated about 6 miles westward of Horncastle; the village\r\nbeing less than a mile from the Stixwould station, on the loop line of\r\nthe Great Northern Railway, between Boston and Lincoln.  The parish is\r\nbounded on the west by the river Witham, on the north by Horsington, and\r\non the east and south by Woodhall and Edlington.  In Domesday book the\r\nname takes the form of Stigeswald, or Stigeswalt.  The origin of this\r\nname can only be a matter of conjecture, but the following, as not being\r\nwithout interest, is suggested.  The ancient arrangement for crossing a\r\nriver, especially a sluggish, oozy one, such as the Witham, was commonly\r\nby a stockaded ford. {185}  This stockade would be constructed of stakes\r\nor sticks, a kind of structure which is also implied in the names\r\nStickford, (_i.e._, staked ford), and Stickney (staked water, or island),\r\nboth of which places lie in what was formerly a marshy district in this\r\ncounty. {186a}  Hence, we may suppose, the first syllable of the name\r\nStix (or Sticks) wold; as to the next syllable, “Wold,” or wald, is the\r\nSaxon for wood.  At some places certain woods were anciently assigned by\r\nlaw or custom, for the supply of these stakes. {186b}; and such a wood\r\nmight naturally acquire the name of the Stakes wood, or Sticks wold.\r\n\r\nIn the case of this parish, as the embankment, now confining the Witham\r\nto its narrow channel, did not anciently exist, that river would then\r\nhave a much greater width, and the ford would probably be a long\r\n“causeway” through a morass, raised by sods and strengthened by stakes.\r\n{186c}  Mr. C. Gowen-Smith, the translator of Domesday Book, for\r\nLincolnshire, says (Introduction, p. xl.) that “wad,” or “wode,” means “a\r\ncauseway.”  We thus, on either of these suppositions, get Stixwould\r\nmeaning a staked ford, or causeway. {186d}\r\n\r\nIn the days of ancient savage warfare, fords were important positions of\r\ndefence; and especially on the Witham would a ford be important, that\r\nriver being the boundary between the barbarous “Girvii,” who inhabited\r\nthe wild Fen tracts, {186e} and the less warlike Saxons, who dwelt east\r\nof it.  A ford also, or ferry, was a source of considerable revenue; for\r\ninstance, at Stow, the lord of the manor, in 1234, let the ferry on the\r\nTrent (now of Littleborough), with the fishery, for £3 6_s._ 8_d._\r\nyearly, a large sum in those days.  Thus the staked ford, and the wood\r\nsupplying the stakes, may well have been local features of sufficient\r\nimportance to originate the name of Stickswold.\r\n\r\nOf the wood formerly existing, there are still some relics, in fine oak\r\ntrees of great age; one of these, nearly 20ft. in girth, is to be seen by\r\nthe garden gate at the abbey farm house; another stands near the drive to\r\nHalstead Hall, in the east of the parish; and others are nearer the\r\nWitham, in fields adjoining Newstead House farm.  The present Stixwould\r\nwood, or Long wood, south of the village, is of comparatively modern\r\ngrowth; but on the eastern border of the parish is Halstead wood,\r\nseparated from Sto-bourne wood, by what, probably, was formerly a “stow,”\r\n“stoke,” or stake-marked “bourn,” or boundary stream, being a ditch of\r\nrunning water, which gives its name to the latter wood, which lies in the\r\nnext parish; the two woods until recent years, belonging to the two\r\ndifferent manors.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Norman Conquest, we find only two names of Saxon\r\nlandowners in this parish, viz.:—Ulviet, and Siward, who had here between\r\nthem, about 720 acres.  Both these would seem to have been thanes of some\r\nimportance, as the former held, in demesne or otherwise, lands in at\r\nleast ten other parishes, in various parts of the county; and the latter\r\nhad lands in eleven parishes, also widely distributed, and further, had\r\nsufficient influence to continue as tenant, under the Norman proprietors,\r\nto whom the Conqueror transferred the lands previously owned by Saxons.\r\n{187}  Of Normans, a grant of 270 acres (that amount having been\r\npreviously owned by Ulviet,) was conferred by King William, upon Waldin\r\nBrito (or the Breton), a distinguished soldier, who accompanied him from\r\nNormandy.  These Bretons were highly valued for their faithful services,\r\nby the Plantagenet kings, and were largely employed in court offices;\r\nWaldin also received manors in eight other parishes in this\r\nneighbourhood.  Another favourite of the Conqueror, who received land\r\nhere, was Alured, of Lincoln.  The Domesday Survey gives him as owning\r\n180 acres of arable, meadow, and wood land in Stixwould, with fifty-one\r\nmanors in the county, beside lands elsewhere.\r\n\r\nA still larger proprietor was Ivo Taillebois, Earl of Anjou, and nephew\r\nof the Conqueror.  On him, William bestowed in marriage, the Saxon Lady\r\nLucia, sister of Edgiva, wife of the late King Harold.  Beside the lands\r\nof her father, Earl Algar, she had succeeded to the large possessions of\r\nher uncle, Sheriff Thorold, of the neighbouring Bucknall (where\r\ntraditions still linger of him, and his sister, the “Lady Godiva.”)  She\r\nwas probably a kinswoman of the above Alured, of Lincoln, since his\r\nrelative, Alan of Lincoln, is named in old deeds, as nephew of Thorold.\r\nEither through her, or by direct grant to himself, Ivo owned 1,020 acres\r\nin Stixwould, beside lands in 104 other parishes.  On this Ivo Taillebois\r\n(or “Underwood” as the name signifies), we may here make a few remarks.\r\nHe was commonly known as “the Lord of Holland,” through his wife’s\r\nextensive possessions in that division of the county, inherited from\r\nThorold, her uncle, who was lord of Spalding, and he also had a fine\r\nresidence at Spalding, where he lived in great state.  He was, however,\r\nof a temperament fitted rather to inspire fear than affection.  The\r\nchronicler, Ingulphus (“History of Croyland Abbey,”) tells us, that his\r\ndependants “supplicated him on bended knees, and did him all due\r\nservice,” but, in return, he “tortured, harrassed, and daily loaded them\r\nwith fresh burdens”; and by his cruelty, “compelled most of them to sell\r\ntheir property and seek other countries.”  On the death of his patron,\r\nthe Conqueror, he joined a conspiracy against William Rufus, and was\r\nbanished the country.  After a few years he was allowed to return, but\r\ndied shortly afterwards of paralysis, in 1114. {188}  Having been forced\r\nas a husband, by the Conqueror, upon the Lady Lucia, and being further of\r\nthe temperament already described, we may assume that, as the saying is,\r\nthere was “no love lost” between them, and we are therefore hardly\r\nsurprised to find another old chronicler (Peter de Blois), saying, on the\r\ndeath of Ivo, “hardly had a month elapsed, when the Lady Lucia married\r\nthat illustrious man, Roger de Romara, son of Gerald de Romara (seneschal\r\nor high steward of William, as Duke of Normandy), and that she lost all\r\nrecollection of Ivo.”\r\n\r\nThese are the only two landowners, Saxon or Norman, mentioned in Domesday\r\nBook, as having property in Stixwould.  The extent of their lands in the\r\nparish, all added together, amounted to rather less than 2,000 acres,\r\nwhereas the present acreage is nearly 2,360, there is therefore a margin\r\nof between 300 and 400 acres unaccounted for; and this we may probably\r\nassume to have been waste land of bog and morass, subject to the Witham\r\nfloods, and not brought under cultivation till centuries later.\r\nAccordingly, we find that the parish rate-book shows a sudden rise in\r\nvalue of certain land, owing to drainage early in the nineteenth century.\r\nWe are not able to trace the successive landowners of Stixwould through a\r\nconnected series.  There would seem to be some confusion in the old\r\nchroniclers, between the Lady Lucia, who married Ivo Taillebois, and\r\nanother lady of the same name, probably her daughter, who married Roger\r\nde Romara, {189a} and, on his death, married Ranulph, Earl of Chester.\r\nThe eldest son of this Lady Lucia, by Roger de Romara, was William de\r\nRomara, who was created Earl of Lincoln, by King Stephen, A.D. 1140.  His\r\ngrandson, also William de Romara, married Philippa, daughter of John\r\nCount d’ Alencon, {189b} but died childless.  His property would then\r\npass to the descendants of the second husband of the Lady Lucia II.,\r\nviz., Ranulph, Earl of Chester.  The latter married his niece, the\r\nCountess Roheis, to Gilbert de Gaunt, whose grandfather was nephew of\r\nMatilda, wife of William the Conqueror.  He became Earl of Lincoln, and\r\nit is probable that the Earl of Chester’s property passed to him; among\r\nother such lands, being also those in Stixwould, and in this connection,\r\nit is interesting to note that, although in a less exalted position,\r\nthere are still, in this twentieth century, Gaunts in this parish, whose\r\nvery countenance would bespeak their Norman origin.  In course of time,\r\nthe lands of the Gaunts, passed, in great measure, to two families,\r\nnamely, that of the Becks of Lusby, Spilsby, &c., and the Pinsons of\r\nTattershall, &c.  These two families flourished during the 13th, 14th,\r\nand 15th centuries, and they, in turn, were succeeded by the Willoughbys,\r\nancestors of the present Earl of Ancaster, and Lord Willoughby d’Eresby.\r\nA Court Roll, 9 Richard I., shows that Robt. Willoughby had then land in\r\nthe adjoining Wispington, but there is indirect evidence to show that the\r\nWilloughbys had also property in Stixwould, since, in the twenty-second\r\nyear of Edwd. III. (1348), John, the first Lord Willoughby d’Eresby,\r\nendowed the chantry of the Holy Trinity, at Spilsby, with certain lands\r\nin Stixwould, Fulletby, and other parishes (Pat., 22 Ed III); while\r\nfurther, in a charter of Baron Bek (circa 1300), conveying lands to\r\nKirkstead Abbey, we find as witnesses to the deed, William de Wylcheby\r\n(_i.e._, Willoughby), two Beks, William de Thorp, and “Dominus,” Theobald\r\nde Hallested (“Architect. S. Journal,” 1897, p. 38); thus connecting,\r\nagain, Halstead, or Stixwould, with a Willoughby, as well as his\r\nrelatives, the Beks, of Spilsby, and the owners of Tattershall Thorpe.\r\n\r\nAt an earlier date than this, however, we find mention of other owners of\r\nStixwould.  In a list of landowners in Lindsey, in the reign of Henry I.\r\n(1100, 1135), we find Alan of Lincoln (already referred to as kinsman of\r\nAlured), owning six oxgangs (ninety acres), in this parish, with Gilbert\r\nFitz-Gozelin, and Gerard as his tenants, as Siward had been under Alured;\r\nalso Robert de Hay, owning here, one carucate (120 acres).  (Cotton MSS.,\r\nClaudius, C 5, fol. 9_b._, Brit. Museum, “Archit. Journ.,” 1881, p. 197.)\r\n\r\nThe de Hays were a wealthy family, owning lands in Cammerigham,\r\nSpridlington, Fillingham, Hackthorn, Owmby, Barlings and many other\r\nparishes.  (Ibid, pp. 184, 185, &c.)  One of them was among the Barons\r\nwho signed the Magna Charter.\r\n\r\nAt the same date, we find a certain Ralph de Stixwald, holding land in\r\nEdlington, as tenant under Ranulph le Meschin; the latter being the\r\nsecond husband of the (second) Lady Lucy, Earl of Chester, and son of the\r\nVicomte de Bessin, in Normandy.  (Ibid., fol. 14, and “Archæolog. S.\r\nProceedings,” 1848, p. 257).\r\n\r\nNear the close of this 12th century (1 and 3 Richard I., 1190 and 1192),\r\nwe find Roger de Stixwald (with Gerard de Camvill), Sheriff of the\r\nCounty.  He was probably son of the above Ralph de Stixwould.  (“Hist.\r\nLincoln,” 1816, p. 200).  These de Stikswalds resided at Halstead Hall,\r\nin this parish, which will be noticed hereafter under that head.\r\n\r\nBy an Inquisition, taken at Wragby (5 Richard II., 1381–2), it was shewn\r\nthat Margaret, wife of John de Orbi, knight (Orby), held jointly with her\r\nhusband, fifty-two acres of wood in Tattershall and Stixwold, with\r\nvarious other lands; and that Mary de Percy, wife of John de Roos, is\r\ntheir next heir; but that her brother, the Earl of Northumberland,\r\noccupied the land meanwhile.  (“Linc. N. & Q.” vol. vi., No. 47).  Her\r\nwill was proved 29th Augt. 1394.  Mentions of other owners in subsequent\r\ntimes are rather rare.\r\n\r\nOn the Dissolution of the Monasteries, by Hen. VIII., that sovereign in\r\n1541, gave the lands of Stixwould Priory in this parish, to Robert\r\nDighton.  The Dightons had amassed considerable wealth, as merchants in\r\nLincoln.  A Robert Dighton was Mayor in 1494, and again in 1506, and\r\nWilliam Dighton was Sheriff in 1533.  The Robert Dighton, who thus became\r\na landowner in Stixwould, resided at the old hall of Stourton Parva, in\r\nthe parish of Baumber, dividing the ownership of that parish with the\r\nEarls of Lincoln, afterwards Dukes of Newcastle.  He married Joyce,\r\ndaughter and heiress of William St. Paul; the St. Pauls being a good\r\nfamily, later represented by Sir George St. Paul, Bart., who died in\r\n1613.  Robert Dighton’s daughter, married first, Judge Dalison, and\r\nsecondly, Sir F. Ayscough, Bart.  (“Archit. Journ.,” 1891, p. 16).\r\nMembers of both these families took part in the Lincolnshire Rising of\r\n1536, along with John Heneage, Edwd. Dymoke (Sheriff), William\r\nWilloughby, Thimblebies, Massingberds, and many others.  (“State Papers,”\r\nHenry VIII., vol. ii. p. 971, “Architect. S. Journal,” 1894. pp. 174,\r\n&c).  A daughter of Thomas Dighton married Edwd. Clinton, second son of\r\nthe first Earl of Lincoln, of that line (temp. Elizabeth.)\r\n\r\nAnother family, here comes on the scene, viz., the Thimblebys, who\r\nresided at Poolham, a hamlet of the adjoining parish of Edlington; and\r\nfor some generations owned land in Stixwould.  Their chief residence was\r\nat Irnham, near Bourn, where Richard Thimbleby Esq., in 1510, built the\r\nhall, a fine mansion, standing in a well-wooded deer park; having\r\nacquired the property by marriage with an heiress of the Hiltons, whose\r\nancestor, Sir Geoffrey Hilton, again, had obtained it by marriage with an\r\nheiress of the Luterels; that family having also succeeded to it in the\r\nperson of Sir Andrew Luterel, who married an heiress of the Paganels, on\r\nwhose ancestor, the Norman, Ralph Paganel, it had been bestowed by the\r\nConqueror.  The pedigree of the Thimblebys is given in the Herald’s\r\nVisitation of 1562.  They owned property in Claxby, Normanby, Tetford\r\n(manor with advowson), Haltham, High Toynton, Horsington (with moiety of\r\nadvowson), and many other parishes.  They doubtless took their name from\r\nthe proximate parish of Thimbleby, as we find them first designated as\r\nJohn, Thomas, &c., “de Thimbleby.”\r\n\r\nBy a Chancery Inquisition post mortem, of date, 1333 (7 Ed. III.), taken\r\non Friday after the feast of St. Matthew (Sep. 21), at Haltham, it was\r\nshewn that Nicholas de Thymelby held certain land in Haltham, of the\r\nright of his wife Matilda, with lands in Thimbleby, under the Bishop of\r\nCarlisle, and lands in Stikeswold, of the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln.\r\nHe was succeeded by his son John, who married Isabel, daughter and\r\nco-heir of Sir William Fflete, knt., and his successor, William Thymelby,\r\nEsq., apparently married Joan, daughter of Sir Walter Taillebois, one of\r\nthe family connected with Stixwould, through the Lady Lucia, already\r\nnamed, nearly 400 years earlier; Sir Walter was grandnephew of Gilbert\r\nUmfravill, Earl of Angus.  (“Architect. Journ.,” 1896, pp. 297–8).\r\n\r\nAgain (nearly 200 years later), by a Court of Ward’s Inquisition (3, 4,\r\n5, Ed. VI.,) it was shown that Matthew Thimbleby, who married Anne,\r\ndaughter of Sir Robert Hussey, was seised of lands in Styxwolde,\r\nHorsington, Edlington, Thymylby, Buckland (_i.e._ Woodhall), &c.,\r\ninheriting them from his father (Ibid. p. 258).  His widow married Sir\r\nRobert Savile, knt., of Poolham, and through her, he died in 1585–6\r\n(Jany. 24), seised of the same land in Stixwolde, &c.\r\n\r\nWe now pass over eighty years, during which another change in the\r\nownership has taken place.\r\n\r\nIn 1665, and again in 1685, Sir John Coventry, K.B. presented to the\r\nbenefice, and was probably lord of the manor.  At the beginning of the\r\n18th century, Sir Thomas Keate had succeeded as patron (Ecton’s\r\n“Thesaurus,” p. 183) and his widow, Agnes Keate, was owner in 1704.\r\n(Liber Regis, p. 424).  This name is written Kyte, in the “Histories of\r\nLincolnshire,” by Weir, and by Saunders.  They are said to have been a\r\nWarwickshire family; the last of them, Sir William, squandered a large\r\nfortune, and, in a fit of despair, set fire to his fine mansion in the\r\nCotswold hills, and himself perished in the flames.  The manor of\r\nStixwould had been previously sold by him to Lord Anson, the\r\ndistinguished Naval Commander, and Circumnavigator, Lord High Admiral of\r\nEngland, &c., who presented to the benefice in 1753.  On his death, in\r\n1762, his son, Thomas Anson, Esq., of Shuckborough, Co. Stafford,\r\nsucceeded to the property, and presented to the benefice in 1767.\r\n\r\nIn 1763, Mary Lister, fourth daughter of Matthew Lister, Esq., of Burwell\r\nPark, near Louth, married (19 May), Thomas Elmhirst, Esq., of Stixwould\r\n(Parish Register of Burwell, quoted “Archit. Soc. Journal,” 1897, p. 92).\r\nHe was probably at that time tenant of the Abbey Farm House.  Matthew\r\nLister, her father, had married Grace, widow of Sir Edward Boughton,\r\nBart., daughter, and co-heir of Sir John Shuckborough, Bart., of\r\nShuckborough, at which place also resided the above-named Thomas Anson,\r\nson of Lord Anson.\r\n\r\nThe whole estate of Stixwould was afterwards purchased by Edmund Turnor,\r\nEsq., of Stoke Rochford, who first presented to the benefice in 1778, his\r\nnominee, as Vicar, being a member of a very old Lincolnshire family,\r\nBernard Cracroft, who also held the Vicarage of Bardney.  A former Sir\r\nEdmund Turnor was knighted by Charles II., in 1663, as a reward for\r\nservices rendered to that king’s martyred father.  The property still\r\nremains with this family.  Among the gentry of Lincolnshire named at the\r\nHeralds’ Visitation in 1634, is Edwd. Broxholme “of Stixwould,” who seems\r\nto have had relatives at Lincoln, North Kelsey, Grimsby, Nettleham, and\r\nelsewhere among the county gentry; one of them, John of Otbye,\r\ncontributing £25 to the national loan for defence against the Spanish\r\nArmada.  (“Linc. N. & Q.” ii., pp. 9 and 134).  Whether this Edward\r\nBroxholme was a landowner in Stixwould, or a tenant, does not appear.  He\r\nresided at the Priory.\r\n\r\nWe now give a brief notice of Stixwould Priory, dedicated to the blessed\r\nVirgin Mary.  This was founded by the Lady Lucia (_i.e._, the second of\r\nthat name), and her two sons, Ranulph, Earl of Chester, and William de\r\nRomara, Earl of Lincoln (Leland “Collect.,” vol. i., p. 92), in the reign\r\nof Stephen.  The Rev. Thos. Cox, in his “Lincolnshire” (of date, 1719),\r\nascribes the foundation to Galfred de Ezmondeys. {194}  Doubtless, at\r\ndifferent periods, additions and augmentations were made to the original\r\ninstitution, entitling the benefactors to be numbered among the\r\n“fundatores”; but the general testimony of Leland, Dugdale, and others,\r\nis in favour of the Lady; whose uncle, Sheriff Thorold, was a benefactor\r\nto Croyland Abbey, and founded Spalding Priory, his sister, the Lady\r\nGodiva, also (as the Chronicler Henry of Huntingdon tells us), spending\r\nmuch of her vast wealth in building monasteries and churches, while her\r\ndescendant, William de Romara II., founded Revesby Abbey.  By an\r\nInquisition taken 3 Edwd. I. (1275), it was found that the lands held by\r\nthe Priory, given by these and other benefactors, had been so held for\r\n100 years (Dugdale’s “Monasticon” i., p. 56, No. 486); and further, by an\r\nInquisition at Stamford, in the same reign, it was found that the Priory\r\nhad certain lands at Huntingdon, from divers benefactors (“Ibid.” ii., p.\r\n223, No. 809), one of these being Alexander Creveceur, a member of a\r\ndistinguished Norman family, who owned lands in Somersby, circa A.D.,\r\n1242, and in several other parishes in this neighbourhood; the name also\r\nappearing in the Battle Roll.  They are now represented by the de\r\nCourcy’s whose chief, Lord Kinsale, is premier Baron of Ireland, and\r\nentitled by royal warrant to the singular privilege of keeping his hat on\r\nin the Sovereign’s presence.  Besides the Huntingdon property, the Priory\r\npossessed house property in Lincoln, 900 acres of land in Honington, 120\r\nin Bassingthorpe, 120 in Bucknall, 42 in Wyberton, 249 in Stixwould, with\r\nthe advowson of the Church; smaller amounts in Westby, Waynfleet,\r\nHorkstow, Wymondham, Low Toynton, Tupholme, the advowson of Waynfleet\r\nbenefice; 2 tofts in Horsington, to provide candles for the altar, and a\r\npension from Alford; while the Prioress also received as lesser\r\nperquisites, obits, mortuaries, Easter offerings, “shot for wax,”\r\n“Lincoln farthings,” “Assize of bread and beer,” and various “fines and\r\namerciaments.”  (Oliver’s “Religious Houses,” pp. 65, 6.)\r\n\r\nAs to the particular ecclesiastical order to which this Priory belonged,\r\nauthorities differ.  In Thomas Coxe’s “Lincolnshire” (already referred\r\nto), it is called a Gilbertine Institution; Stukeley (in his “Itinerarium\r\nCuriosum,” vol. i., p. 88), calls it Benedictine; while Dugdale, in his\r\n“Monasticon,” vol. i., No. 486, places it among the Benedictines, and in\r\nvol. ii., No. 809, gives it as Gilbertine; while Noble and others call it\r\nCistercian.  The Cistercians, however, were only a stricter sect of the\r\nBenedictines.  The early training of Gilbert had been mainly Cistercian,\r\nand we shall therefore probably be right in saying that Stixwould Priory\r\nwas at first a Gilbertine, and afterwards changed to a Benedictine\r\nestablishment of the strictest order.  As to the strictness of the\r\nregulations, we gather full evidence from the accounts given by Dr.\r\nOliver, in his “Religious Houses on the Witham,” from which we here make\r\na few quotations.  We may premise that, although the sisterhood consisted\r\nnominally of a Prioress and Nuns, there was a resident male “Master of\r\nthe Nuns” (Court Rolls, 6 Richard I.); and, at times, at least, according\r\nto Leland (“Collect.,” i., p. 92), there were also “Brothers” (fratres),\r\nas at the Sempringham House, which Gilbert founded.  The time of the nuns\r\nwas chiefly spent in works of charity, reading legends of the Saints,\r\nsolitary meditation and prayer (a perfunctory repetition of devotions,\r\nwhich must too often have been deadening, rather than invigorating, to\r\nspiritual life), and needlework, such as the embroidery of altar cloths,\r\n&c. {196a}  They were not even allowed to converse with each other,\r\nexcept on permission from the Prioress; they could only converse with\r\nfriends from outside through a grating “of the length of a finger, and\r\nbarely a thumb’s breadth,” and with a veil over it, in the presence of\r\ntwo “discreet sisters”; and all letters were inspected by the Prioress.\r\nThe Convent was so shut in by walls, as “scarcely (it was said) to leave\r\nan entrance for birds,” and, during divine service, the door of the\r\nchoir, where they sat, was closed, so that they could not see, or be seen\r\nby, strangers.  The diet was of the plainest, and if a nun was\r\ndisobedient, it was reduced to bread and water.  They were not allowed to\r\ngo beyond the Priory walls except to visit the sick, or attend funerals;\r\nand even in the Priory garden, usually a resort for monastic recreation,\r\nbut an indulgence only granted to these sisters on Sundays and festivals,\r\nthey were allowed to pluck only jessamine and violets, except by special\r\npermission.  These rules, however, were occasionally relaxed; they were\r\npermitted to cultivate music and dancing, and even to attend the village\r\nsports (Oliver, p. 67, note 8); and the Prioress, who by charter had free\r\nwarren over the Priory lands, is said to have indulged in hawking and\r\nhunting (Placit. de quo Warranto, 22 Edwd. I.) {196b}  This house was\r\ndissolved with more than 600 other monastic establishments by Henry VIII.\r\nin the 27th year of his reign (A.D. 1536); a year later he founded in its\r\nplace, and with the same revenues, “for the good of his soul, and that of\r\nhis Consort Jane,” a Premonstratensian house, which, however, only\r\ncontinued two years, when it, in turn, was abolished.  The last Prioress\r\nunder the old regime was Helena Key; the first and only Prioress, under\r\nthe new regime, being Mary Missenden (Dugdale “Monast.,” iii., No. 81.)\r\nThe estates, as already mentioned, were bestowed, on the final\r\ndissolution of this house, upon Robert Dighton.  According to Speed, the\r\nhistorian, the value of the estates was £163 1_s._ 2½_d._, which was in\r\nthose days a considerable sum.  The steward for some of the Lindsey\r\nestates of the Priory was John Heneage, brother of Sir Thomas Heneage of\r\nHainton; for others of the estates in the same division, Sir Robert\r\nDymoke; for the estates in Kesteven, Sir Robert Hussey, a younger brother\r\nof Lord Hussey, of Sleaford; these two brothers having between them no\r\nless than 23 stewardships for religious houses, that post being one of no\r\nsmall emolument.\r\n\r\nNothing now remains of the Priory itself, beyond some stone coffins lying\r\nclose to the north wall of the parish church, which were found to the\r\nwest of the Abbey Farm house.  There remained, however, until 1846, when\r\nthey were removed to give space for the present farm buildings, a postern\r\ngate, and the east end of the Priory chapel {197} with a window of the\r\ndate of Edwd. III.; under the arch of the gateway were the arms of the\r\nLeake family of Lincolnshire carved on a truss of wood, “Argent a chief,\r\ngules, over all a bend engrailed, azure.”  A rough sketch of these\r\nremains by Mr. Willson, architect, is in the possession the lord of the\r\nmanor and from it a sketch is given by the Rev. J. A. Penny, late Vicar,\r\nin vol. iii., of “Linc. N. & Q.” p. 161.  The moat round the Priory\r\nenclosed an area of about 4 acres, and was connected with the Witham,\r\nabout three-quarters of a mile distant, doubtless for the conveyance of\r\ngoods to the monastery, as well as for the renewal of the moat water, and\r\nthat of the stew ponds, a matter of some importance where a supply of\r\nfish was required for the “fasting” diet of “the religious.”\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to a description of the church, dedicated to St. Peter,\r\nwhich possesses features of more than usual interest.  This was rebuilt\r\nin 1831, the architect being Mr. W. A. Nicholson, of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe former building was on the same site as the present, but larger.\r\nWilson (architect, of Lincoln), in a MS. collection of churches (vol.\r\nii., p. 87), has the following notes on the earlier fabric:—“Stixwould,\r\nspacious; has been elegant, full of curious remnants; style, Edwd. VI. or\r\nHenry VIII.; tower very handsome, but much decayed, the walls being built\r\nof soft-grained stone (_i.e._, the usual ‘Spilsby’ sandstone).  Interior\r\nhas been very beautiful, lofty pointed arches, roof of nave and south\r\naisle supported on rich carved figures of angels, with shields, etc.;\r\nwindows full of scattered remnants of beautiful stained glass; old oak\r\ndesks and benches with carved (finials); curious font; upper end of south\r\naisle inclosed by two screens of oak, mutilated, but exquisitely rich and\r\nelegant; this is called ‘the little choir,’ and belongs to Halstead Hall\r\nin Stixwould; choir screen very lofty, with front of rood-loft over it,\r\npainted with Ten Commandments, in ‘black letter’; choir same date as\r\nnave; east window spoilt; some ancient slabs, one of two children of the\r\nWelby family (this is now lost) in the little choir; both aisles have had\r\naltars; two bells; curious stone, with letters like a clock face, in\r\nfront of tower {198} (N.B.—This was removed some years ago, to Newport,\r\nLincoln, but has been seen at Stixwould by the present writer).  Base and\r\npart of pillar of churchyard cross remain; Mr. Turnor (lord of the\r\nmanor), took some painted glass from the church ‘to the Hall at Stoke\r\nRochford’.”  So far, Mr. Willson.  We may add that the panels of the\r\npulpit of Lea Church, 12 miles beyond Lincoln, were taken from Stixwould.\r\n\r\nAs to the present fabric, I have been favoured with the following\r\nobservations by the Rev. J. Alpass Penny, Vicar of Wispington, formerly\r\nof Stixwould.  The church consists of nave, chancel, and a good tower\r\ncontaining two bells; one of these being exactly the same as that in the\r\nGuildhall at Lincoln, with date 1370, dedicated to “St. Katrine,” with\r\nNottingham foundry mark, founder’s initials, and merchant’s mark.  The\r\npinnacles and figures on the tower are from the former tower; the choir\r\nscreen, now only one third of the original, consists of three equal-sized\r\nbays, the central one forming a doorway; and has been pronounced by Dr.\r\nF. Mansel Sympson (“Architectural S. Journal,” 1890, p. 211) to be “of\r\nexcellent work;” it has however, been recently removed, by the late vicar\r\n(in 1899), from the chancel arch to its eastern wall, and now forms a\r\nrather elegant reredos.  The chancel was enlarged, and the nave reseated,\r\nin 1864.  The stone slab in the nave floor, nearest to the Chancel arch,\r\nof date 1722, is in memory of a Boulton, who, as well as his ancestors\r\nfor several generations, resided at the Abbey Farm house: he stabbed his\r\nmother to death in the little chapel outside the Priory gate, no longer\r\nexisting. {199}  The stone figure-heads and angels within the church\r\nbelonged to the former edifice, as did also the bench ends south of the\r\nnave.  The royal arms, with date 1662, formerly in the church, are now in\r\na wall of the entrance hall at the Abbey Farm house; and the holy water\r\nstoup is now under the pump in the school yard.  There is a fine slab,\r\nwith cross, lying outside the tower, which was dug up on the site of the\r\nPriory, also a stone coffin; other fragments were found in the vicarage\r\ngarden.  The font is octagonal, divided into panels by rich pinnacles\r\nwith lions and flowers, the panels bearing four quaintly-cut emblems of\r\nthe Evangelists, with names in black letter, but now very indistinct; the\r\nfigures between them being a monk, seated in chair, and holding Y in his\r\nhand, representing January; next, a man with arms akimbo, facing east,\r\nmeaning February; next, a friar, for March; and next, a man in flat cap\r\nwith sword, holding a rose in his left hand, and his right resting on his\r\nbelt, for April.  This curious font is engraved, in outline, by James\r\nSandly Padley, in his work “Selections from the Ancient Monastic,\r\nEcclesiastical, and Domestic Edifices of Lincolnshire.”  Waterlow, 1851.\r\n\r\nThe register dates from 1543.  In a parish book are some curious items\r\nbetween 1624 and 1629, or the early years of the reign of Charles I.\r\nThese shew that the parish overseers “held the artillery in charges,”\r\nalso the “town musket and knapsack.”  The military forces were at that\r\ntime a sort of militia, maintained by local rates, and every parish\r\ncontributed towards it, in money, arms, and accoutrements.  Probably\r\nthese contributions were sometimes compounded for by a lump payment, as\r\nwe here find mention of a sum being paid “for excusing of the town” from\r\nits liability.  There is also mention of alms being given to certain\r\npersons who had been taken prisoners “by the Dunkirkers” _i.e._, the\r\nDunkirk privateers.  This, however, must belong to a rather later date,\r\nsince the English and Dutch were in conflict at Dunkirk in 1635, and\r\nDunkirk was taken by the French and English from the Spaniards, and\r\nfinally handed over to England, in the last year of Cromwell’s\r\nadministration, June, 1658.\r\n\r\nMention is also made of the payment of “dog-whippers,” officials who\r\ndrove dogs out of the church at the time of service.  In some churches in\r\nWales the whips are still to be seen.  Another item is the payment of\r\n“dyke-reeve,” a very useful official in parishes in, or bordering on, the\r\nfens, where inundations were only to be avoided by keeping the “dykes and\r\nmeres” in proper order.\r\n\r\nWe are enabled to give here a list of the vicars of Stixwould from A.D.\r\n1425 to the present time, except for an interval of about 70 years,\r\nthrough the researches of Mr. Gibbon, author of “Early Lincolnshire\r\nWills.”  Thomas Lane, 1425–1440; Giles Storror, 1440–1472; John\r\nShadworth, 1472–1482; Thomas Tymson, 1482–1485; Alexander Anyson,\r\n1485–1502; John Aby, 1502–1520; John Robynson, 1520–1530; John Oregower,\r\n1530.  Down to this date, all appointments had been made by the Lady\r\nPrioress; and there is a gap in Mr. Gibbon’s list till 1603.  We are,\r\nhowever, able partly, if not entirely, to fill up the gap, since we find\r\nthat in 1548, Thomas Wilson, clerk, S.T.B., was presented by Edmund\r\nDighton, of Donington (kinsman, doubtless, of Robert Dighton, to whom the\r\nPriory estates were granted by Henry VIII. on the Dissolution), “this\r\nturn of advowson being given by the late Prioress and convent of B.V.”\r\n(Institutions to Benefices, “Architectural Journal,” 1898, p. 476, No.\r\n328).  Also, in a List of Institutions in the 16th century, without date,\r\nbut among several others in the middle of that century (“Linc. N. & Q.”\r\nvol. vi., No. 45, p. 10), we find John Cressie, clerk, appointed by\r\nThomas Disney, of Carlton-in-Moreland, gentleman, by grant of the\r\nPrioress to him and others, vacant by resignation of John Boysworth, and\r\nthese three nominations may well have embraced the 70 years.  The next\r\nvicar was probably Richard Travisse, who is mentioned in Mr. Gibbon’s\r\nlist as signing, in 1603, a bequest (and therefore, we may assume, near\r\nthe close of his vicariate) of “xl_s._”, the interest to be used “for the\r\nbenefit of the poor, and church, of Stixwould.”  He was succeeded by\r\nThomas Burton, buried October 21st, 1617.  Then followed Francis Bowman,\r\nvicar in 1618; Richard Skiggs, 1648; John Skelton, 1665: a note here\r\nstates that from 1677 to 1704, being in the time of Mr. Fox, vicar, the\r\nregisters were all on loose papers, and were lost by W. Reading, vicar.\r\n(This Thomas Fox was appointed by Sir John Coventry, K.B., in 1685).  He\r\nwas succeeded by William Reading, just named; who was followed by Anthony\r\nBaker, appointed by Lord Anson, 1753; George Blennerhaysett (also vicar\r\nof Saxilby) was appointed by Thomas Anson in 1767; Bernard Cracroft (also\r\nvicar of Bardney) was the first nominee of Edmund Turnor, of Panton, in\r\n1778; William Mounsey, 1802; Washbourn Uvedale, 1832, who died within the\r\nyear; William Gurdon Moore, 1833; John Francis Wray, 1839; John Woodlands\r\nWatkin, 1852; William Lush, 1870; William Bennett, 1881; J. A. Penny,\r\n1888; A. R. Wilson, 1896; James Bryan Turner, 1901.\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to treat of the Halstead Hall estate, in this parish,\r\nformerly a distinct lordship.  The earliest mention we can find of this\r\nas a separate manor, is in the 13th century, a deed of that period naming\r\nRoger, son of Roger de Stixwould, and Sir Theobald de Stykeswald, knight:\r\nthis Theobald also witnessed a deed as “Dominus Theobaldus de Halstead,”\r\nMay 22nd, 1281.  (“Linc. N. & Q.” 1897, p. 82).  Their grandfather would\r\nappear to have been the Roger de Stixwould who, with Gerard de Camvill,\r\nwas sheriff of Lincoln A.D. 1190, and again 1192–1193.  In the survey of\r\nthe county, made between 1114 and 1118, Ralph de Stixwould is named as\r\nholding 1 carucate and 4 oxgangs (180 acres) in Edlington, under Ranulph\r\nde Meschin, Earl of Lincoln, son of the second Lady Lucia, already\r\nreferred to.  We may therefore infer that these four generations, at that\r\nearly period, resided at Halstead, being designated indifferently “de\r\nStikeswald” or “de Halstead.”  We have then to pass over an interval of\r\nmore than 180 years, when, in 1465, a Richard Welby, of Moulton, names\r\nHalstead in his will as part of his property.  He was sheriff in 1471,\r\nand M.P., 1472.  We find a Chancery Inquisition (18 Henry VII., No. 96)\r\nheld at Spalding, 24 April, 1503, whereby it was shown that Thomas Welby,\r\nwho was sheriff in 1492, died October 16, 1497, seised of the manors of\r\nMoulton, Freeston, Sutton, Farlesthorpe, and Halstead, besides lands in\r\nseveral other parishes.  (“Architectural S. Journal,” 1895, p. 18).\r\n\r\nHis will was dated Dec. 9, 1493; the executors being Sir Edward Borough,\r\nknt., Sir G. Tailbois, knt. (a name, as we have seen, already connected\r\nwith this parish), and others.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded in these possessions by his son and heir, another Thomas\r\nWelby.  In 1586, Vincent Welby, “of Hawstead” Esq., is mentioned, along\r\nwith Thomas Dighton, of Waddingworth (another name already mentioned in\r\nconnection with Stixwould), Sir E. Dymmock, Sir G. Heneage, etc., as\r\ncontributing “horses and lances” for the defence of the country against\r\nthe Spanish Armada.  (“Architect. S. Journal,” 1894, p. 213).  This\r\nVincent Welby was son of the above, second, Thomas Welby, {202} by\r\nDorothy, daughter of Vincent Grantham, of Goltho, near Wragby, and of St.\r\nMartin’s Lincoln; a name still surviving in good position in the county.\r\nVincent Welby also subscribed, in 1589, £25 towards the loan for the\r\ndefence of the country, along with his neighbours, Robert Phillips, of\r\nWispington, Robt. Smithe, of Horsington, Willm. Heneage, of Benington,\r\nand others.  (“Linc. N. & Q.” vol. ii., p. 133).\r\n\r\nIn 1561, March 21st, Richard Welby, of Halstead, was granted the crest of\r\n“an arm armed, the hand charnell (_i.e._, flesh-coloured or ‘proper’)\r\nyssving out of a cloud, azure, in a flame of fire,” the arms are “sable a\r\nfess, between three fleur de lys, argent,” with six quarterings.  This\r\ncoat of arms is said to have been formerly over a mantelpiece in Halstead\r\nHall, but was removed, several years ago, to Denton Hall.  In the year\r\n1561, this Richard Welby, of Halstead, was Sheriff of Lincoln.  There are\r\nmany entries of the Welbys in the parish registers of Stixwould; the last\r\nof these occurs in 1598.\r\n\r\nThe next who owned, and resided at Halstead, was Richard Evington, who\r\nwas buried at Stixwould.  By his will, dated 22nd January, 1612, he left\r\nhis lands in Edlington and other places to his two sons, Maurice and\r\nNicholas, and bequeathed the sum of £4 10_s_. “yearlie, at the discretion\r\nof my executors, to the poore of Stixwolde, on the 25th March, and 29th\r\nSept.”  This family did not, apparently, long remain at Halstead, since\r\nwe find entries in the Register of the death of this Richard, 10 March,\r\n1610; and the baptism of Maurice, son of Nicholas Evington, 2 Nov., 1611;\r\nand we hear no more of them, another family succeeding, of whom there are\r\nthe following mentions in the register:—“Mr. George Townshend Esqr. died\r\natt Halstead and was buried att Waddingworth on Wednsdaie _night_ the\r\n13th of Februarie 1627,” and “Mr. Kirkland Snawden [note the local\r\npronunciation for Snowden] and Mrs. Townsend married the 25th of December\r\nbeing Christmas daie 1628.” {203}  No reason is assigned for the somewhat\r\nunusual burial by night (though still occasionally practised), but he was\r\nprobably a Papist, not entitled to burial in a Protestant churchyard.\r\nNotice is specially drawn to the second entry, by a hand with finger\r\nextended towards it, sketched in the margin, implying probably some\r\ncovert allusion.  This Kirkland Snowden was a grandson of the Bishop of\r\nCarlisle, his father, the Bishop’s son, being Vicar of Horncastle, the\r\nrectorship being vested in the Bishop of Carlisle, who had a residence in\r\nHorncastle at that time, at the back of the premises now occupied by\r\nMessrs. Lunn and Dodson.  Mr. George Townshend belonged to the Norfolk\r\nfamily of that name, and left his Manor of Cranworth in that county to\r\nhis eldest son Thomas.  This Kirkland Snowden is elsewhere named Rutland\r\nSnowden.  Their eldest son, Robert, had a daughter Jane, who married\r\nCharles Dymoke of Scrivelsby, and their eldest daughter Abigail, married\r\nEdward Dymoke, younger son of Sir Edward Dymoke, 18 July, 1654, and was\r\nancestress of the Tetford branch of the Dymokes, now also (1904) of\r\nScrivelsby.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Gibbon family lived at Halstead, coming from Tealby, and\r\nare supposed to have owned it, the baptism of “John Gibon” being\r\nregistered in 1666.  Another owner of Halstead was Sir John Coventry,\r\nBart., who as before stated, presented to the benefice of Stixwould in\r\n1685.  His sister married the 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, who is said to\r\nhave been entertained more than once with a large retinue at Halstead.\r\nSir John was the subject of various attacks, for using offensive language\r\nconcerning his eccentric Sovereign, Charles II, asking in Parliament\r\n“whether the King’s pleasure lay in the men, or women players” at the\r\ntheatres; in consequence of which “The Coventry Act” was passed in 1671,\r\nmaking it felony to maim or disfigure a person, and declaring the\r\nSovereign incompetent to pardon such offenders.  Halstead, subsequently,\r\nbecame the property of Sir William Kyte, or Keate; then of Lord Anson,\r\nand his son Thomas Anson, who presented to the benefice in 1767, and it\r\nwas in 1778, bought by Edmund Turnor, Esq., of Stoke Rochford.  Having\r\nbeen the residence of these various owners of wealth and position, we can\r\nhardly doubt that Halstead Hall was formerly much larger then it is at\r\npresent, and there still remains, as a part of the farm buildings, a\r\nlofty structure with stone-framed windows; the walls being of brick,\r\nsmaller than those of modern times, and relieved by diamond-shaped\r\npatterns of black bricks, indicating a care and taste in the style of\r\nerection, which would hardly have been bestowed upon a mere barn.  It\r\nprobably dates from the 15th century. {204}  The present Hall, probably\r\nerected in the 16th century, is a two-storeyed structure; the rooms not\r\nlarge, but lofty, their height on the ground floor being over 10ft, and\r\non the upper floor more than 13ft, with spacious attics above, for\r\nstores; the walls are very substantial, being 2½ft. thick; while the\r\nwindows, with their massive mullions of Ancaster stone, would indicate a\r\nmuch larger building; and foundations of further buildings have, from\r\ntime to time, been discovered.\r\n\r\nIn recent times Halstead Hall has been chiefly remarkable for the great\r\nrobbery, which occurred there on February 2nd, 1829, the details of which\r\nare so peculiar that we give them here.  The Hall was at that time\r\noccupied by the farming tenant, Mr. Wm. Elsey, his wife, and servants.\r\nAt 8 o’clock in the evening, when the servant men went out to “supper-up”\r\nthe horses, they were attacked by seven or eight men, thrown down, their\r\nlegs tied, and their hands secured behind their backs, and each was left\r\nin a separate stall of the stable.  The stable door was then locked, and\r\none of the gang was stationed outside to keep watch.  The thieves then\r\nwent to the Hall, and knocked at the back door.  One of the servant girls\r\nasked who was there; when the answer was given, “Open the door, Betsy.”\r\nShe did so; when four or five men rushed into the kitchen.  One of the\r\nmaids escaped, and ran to the room where her master and mistress were\r\nsitting.  Mr. Elsey was smoking his pipe; Mrs. Elsey preparing something\r\nfor supper.  She saved the silver spoon, which she was using, by slipping\r\nit into her bosom.  Mr. Elsey seized the poker to defend himself; but, on\r\nseeing their number, he prudently laid it down.  They then rifled his\r\npockets, took his watch and money; also making Mrs. Elsey empty her\r\npockets.  They then obliged the two to go into a large closet, locked the\r\ndoor, and tied a hayfork across it.  They then collected what plate they\r\ncould find, to the value of about £30, and £50 in cash; taking also all\r\nthe silk handkerchiefs they could find.  They then ransacked the\r\nproperty, and made a hearty meal.  Mrs. Elsey, in her confinement close\r\nby, complained to them that she was very cold, and begged them to let her\r\nout to get to the fire.  Accordingly, one of them brought her out to the\r\nfire; but seeing that she was noticing them, he ordered her to go into\r\nthe closet again, giving her some of the overcoats, which were hanging in\r\nthe passage near.  When they had got all they wanted, they compelled Mr.\r\nElsey to go upstairs, one walking before him, and another behind, each\r\nholding a pistol.  They then obliged Mrs. Elsey to follow him.  Having\r\nlocked up the two once more in the closet, the marauders went off with\r\ntheir plunder, wishing them good night, and saying that, if any alarm was\r\ngiven, they would return to retaliate.  About two hours afterwards, Mr.\r\nElsey, with the aid of a knife and small hammer, succeeded in making a\r\nhole through the brick wall of the closet, through which one of the maids\r\nwas able to thrust her arm and set them at liberty.  The only article\r\nrecovered was a plated coffee-pot found in Halstead wood, which the\r\nthieves had thrown away.  The footpath, outside this wood, passes near a\r\nfarmhouse, and the farmer named Sleight, heard the voices of the thieves\r\nas they went by in the night; and some of them were found drunk by the\r\nroadside next morning.  An old woman still alive (1904), and aged 93, has\r\ntold the writer that she remembers this robbery well; that two of the\r\nrobbers were hanged together at Lincoln, with a sheep-stealer “Bill\r\nClarke,” the last time that offence was punished by hanging; these two\r\nwere known as “Lister,” (others say “Tippler,”) and “Tiger Tom”; {206a}\r\nthe latter was a desperate character, and it was thought that no one\r\nwould take him; but two men, powerfully built and fearless, David English\r\nof Hameringham, and a keeper named Bullivant, were set to the task, and\r\nthey succeeded in running their men down at “The Bungalow,” a small\r\npublic house on the bank of the Witham at Boston. {206b}  Of the last\r\nhanged it is said, that he was such a bad character, that his own mother\r\nforetold that he would “die in his shoes,” and that, on the scaffold, he\r\nshook off his shoes, in order to falsify her prediction.  One of them,\r\nwho was transported for life, leagued with two other criminals on board\r\nthe same vessel, and the three were caught in the act of attempting to\r\nscuttle the ship, and were afterwards thrown overboard.  As a tinge of\r\nromance not uncommonly has attended daring exploits of this character, it\r\nwas remarked at the time that Italian banditti could hardly have planned\r\nthe robbery more cleverly, or carried it out with more deliberate\r\ncourage.  Some mystery seemed to hang about the apparent leader of the\r\nparty, whose demeanour was said to be above that of his temporary\r\nposition; and one of them, Timothy Brammar, was exalted into a hero, by\r\nbeing celebrated in a ballad.\r\n\r\nThere are some rather singular field-names in this parish; as\r\n“Bull-pingle,” to the east, one field from the road to Horsington;\r\n“pingle” being a Lincolnshire word for a small inclosure (Brogden’s\r\n“Provincial Words.”)  “The Devil’s Parlour” is a triangular field,\r\nabutting on “The Monk’s Drain,” adjoining the Bull-pingle.  “The Coulter\r\nCast” adjoins Poolham Ings; it is a narrow strip, probably difficult to\r\nplough; hence the names adjoining this, are the “High” and “Low”\r\n“Priest’s Fields.”  All these fields are in the Halstead manor.  In\r\nStixwould proper, is “The Field,” _par excellence_, probably one of the\r\nearliest clearings, and so named to distinguish it from the “Wood,” or\r\n“Would,” the “Field,” was where the trees had been “felled;” then there\r\nare the “Warren Field,” “The Sykes,” “Hemp-yard,” the “Town Close,”\r\nprobably where the villeins had right of common pastures.  “Coney-Green,”\r\nlike the “Warren Field,” has a reference to the rabbits, being the term\r\nused in Norman law, for warren, although in some cases, like the\r\n“Coney-Garth,” at Bardney, or “Coney-Green,” at Edlington, it means,\r\nprobably, the “King’s Enclosure.”  Such names as “Steer Piece,” “Ewes\r\nWalk,” “Sheep-cote Lane” (_i.e._, Sheep Bank Lane,) and “Cow Legs,” speak\r\nfor themselves.  There is also the “Mill Field,” although there is no\r\ntradition of a mill having existed; possibly there may have been a mill\r\nin connection with the drainage.  At the junction of the three roads,\r\neast of the village, the Roman “Trivium,” formerly stood, what to the\r\nrustic offender was no “trivial” matter, the village stocks, doubtless\r\nwith the usually concomitant “whipping post.”  These stood on what was\r\ncalled “The Town Mound,” which was levelled about the middle of the last\r\ncentury, and is now only represented by a triangular plot of sward.\r\n\r\nNear the Witham, in a field south of the road to the ferry, the Rev. J.\r\nA. Penny, late vicar, found fragments of mediæval pottery, pieces of\r\n“puzzle jugs,” the neck of a “pilgrim’s bottle,” &c., all of which the\r\nlate Sir Augustus Franks, of the British Museum, pronounced to be\r\nCistercian ware, being only found where Cistercian houses have existed.\r\n\r\nIn the church of St. Andrew, Woodhall Spa, is a sepulchral stone, having\r\na rather rudely-carved effigy of a lady, in the attitude of prayer,\r\nholding a book between her hands.  This now supports the credence table,\r\nbut it was taken from Stixwould priory, and is commonly supposed to have\r\nrepresented the Lady Prioress, or the Lady Lucia, the foundress; the\r\nlatter, however, was buried at Spalding, and would therefore hardly have\r\nan effigy at Stixwould.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOURTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nStourton, called Stourton Magna, or Great Stourton, to distinguish it\r\nfrom Stourton Parva, the hamlet included in Baumber, is rather more than\r\na mile, northward, beyond Baumber, and five miles from Horncastle.  This\r\nwas formerly the property, a sheep-walk, of the Premonstratensian Abbey\r\nof St. Mary, of Tupholme, founded by Robert de Nova Villa or Nevill, in\r\nthe twentieth year of Henry III. (“Liber Regis,” Bacon’s ed. 1786, p.\r\n424).  Dugdale states that he held the lands of the king _in capite_,\r\nfrom the time of the Conquest, with which he endowed that monastery.\r\n(“Monasticon,” vol. ii., 596.)  Land in this parish was also granted by\r\nthe Conqueror, to Eudo, son of Spirewick, the founder of the Tattershall\r\nfamily.  He held five carucates, or about six hundred acres, beside a\r\nmill, and 190 acres of meadow.  The powerful Bishop of Durham, William de\r\nKarilepho, who was Lord Chief Justice under the Conqueror, had also a\r\ngrant of land in this parish, as also had Odo, Bishop of Baieaux, and his\r\nvassal, Ilbert, occupied one carucate, or 120 acres, with villeins,\r\nbordars, and socmen under him, occupying 480 more acres.  The Saxon thane\r\nGrinchel also had here 360 acres, valued in King Edward’s time at 40_s._\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Henry VIII. the family of Dighton, though of mercantile\r\norigin at Lincoln, ancestors having been mayors and sheriffs of that\r\ncity, were landed proprietors in this neighbourhood, one of them, Thomas,\r\nresiding at Waddingworth; but the head of the family was Robert Dighton,\r\nof Stourton Magna, he married Joyce, daughter and heiress of William St.\r\nPaul, of Snarford, which family became extinct on the death of Sir George\r\nSt. Paul, Bart., in 1613.  Robert of Stourton, along with members of the\r\nHeneage, Dymoke, Monson, Hussey, and very many other leading county\r\nfamilies, took part in the Lincolnshire rising, to protest against the\r\ndissolution of the monasteries.  A daughter of Thomas Dighton, of\r\nStourton, married Edward Clinton, of Baumber, who subsequently became\r\nEarl of Lincoln. {209}  The residence of the Dightons, traces of which\r\nstill remain in the moats and mounds, was situated on land now belonging\r\nto W. H. Trafford, Esq., in what is now a grass field, about a mile to\r\nthe west of the present Stourton Hall park and plantations, lying between\r\nthe road, on the north, from Stourton Magna to Minting and Bardney, and,\r\non the south, the main Baumber, or Horncastle and Lincoln, old Roman\r\nhighway.  It must have been a building of some considerable size; the\r\nmoat, which enclosed nearly a square, the sides, just under 100 yards\r\nlong, is distinctly traceable, the whole of the surface of the inclosure\r\nis covered with mounds or depressions; there is an apparent opening in\r\nthe middle of the south-western side, and outside, to the south, are\r\ntraces of a large stew-pond, E-shaped, in length thirty-six yards, by\r\nthirty broad, with a small pond, or reservoir behind it.  A modern drain\r\nhas been made on this south-west side, probably to draw the water off the\r\nmoat, as these moats and ponds were periodically cleaned out.  A\r\nfootpath, forming a short cut between the above-named two roads, passes\r\neast of these remains, so that they can be easily approached and\r\ninspected.  This path branches off from the Horncastle and Lincoln high\r\nroad, at a gate nearly opposite some cottages named the “Hungrum Houses”.\r\nSturton is believed to have been a Roman station.  It is close to the old\r\nroad from Horncastle to Caistor, both Roman towns.\r\n\r\nThe church, dedicated to All Saints, although a heterogeneous mixture of\r\na variety of styles, and for many years in a dilapidated condition, has\r\nsome very interesting features.  The vicar, the Rev. F. M. Blakiston,\r\nfollowing up the efforts of his predecessor, the Rev. E. B. Bland, is now\r\n(1904) raising money to restore the fabric, and with Mr. J. T.\r\nMicklethwaite, as architect, the result will doubtless be a creditable\r\nstructure.  The cost of complete renovation is estimated at close upon\r\n£2,000, so that the work may probably have to extend over some years.\r\nAlthough the aspect of the church has been one of ruin and desolation,\r\nthere are traces of the work of seven centuries.  Domesday Book mentions\r\na church as existing in Saxon times, but of that, nothing remains.  The\r\noldest parts of the present fabric belong to the 12th century.  At that\r\ntime the nave was two-thirds of its present length, and the chancel was\r\nnarrower.  In the 13th century a north aisle, with two arches, and\r\nprobably a tower, with a third and larger north arch, were added.  In the\r\n14th century a new chancel was built, wider and probably longer.  Then\r\nfollowed a period of neglect and varied vicissitudes.  In the 17th\r\ncentury the chancel was shortened, and the present east wall cuts away\r\npart of an eastern sepulchre, in the north chancel wall.  The north aisle\r\nwas taken down probably about this period.  The upper part of the tower\r\nwas removed, probably early in the 19th century, as the bells, three in\r\nnumber, are said to have been sold in 1810.  The stones of the tower and\r\naisle were used for building two sides of the churchyard wall.  Nothing\r\nnow remains of the tower, except the string course at the top of the\r\ntruncated basement, {210} which now forms part of the nave.  There are\r\nstill stones of a Norman arch in the south wall at the back of the modern\r\nporch.  An original window, small and much dilapidated, remains in the\r\nnorth wall of the chancel, a larger one having been bricked up.  There is\r\na priest’s door in the south wall.  The westernmost window in the south\r\nwall of the nave is a relic of the 14th century, the renovation, being of\r\nfloriated style, with two lights.  In the floor of what was the tower are\r\nportions of stone, from the windows of the former aisle, much broken.\r\nThe rest is modern, as is also the roof of the nave.  What is now used as\r\na font is really an old mortar, the old font in Perpendicular style\r\nhaving been, it is said, sold about 40 years ago, and removed to the\r\ngarden of a farmhouse in the adjoining parish of Edlington, where it\r\nstill remains.  The furniture of the church is of the 18th century, or\r\nlater, but there is a good old oak chest.  On the western portion of the\r\nnorth wall is a curious fresco, not probably of very ancient date,\r\nconsisting of a skeleton, and a winged figure rising from a sepulchral\r\nmonument, which bears an inscription, mostly illegible, “Redeem the time,\r\n&c.”  The chancel arch, now almost ruinous, is part of the original\r\nbuilding; south of it, is a tablet, in memory of “William Settle, Clerk,\r\nwho departed this life, July 4, 1848, born at Urswick, in the County of\r\nLancaster, graduated at Trinity College, Cambridge, aged 82, and 52 years\r\nvicar of this parish.”  The Settles have a burial vault in the\r\nchurchyard.  The register dates from 1679.  The name of William Vaux\r\nappears as vicar, from 1690 to 1719.  One entry is as follows:—“Margaret\r\nVaux the 21st child of William Vaux and Elizabeth his wife was baptized\r\nye 23 of October 1718,” and shortly after, follows, in a different hand,\r\n“Mr. William Vaux, vicar, buryed May ye 30, 1719.”  The family would seem\r\nto have continued to reside in the parish, for we find recorded the\r\nburial of Mary Vaux, February 19, 1720; that of Margaret Vaux, September\r\n3rd, 1721; and that of Elizabeth Vaux, “January ye 10, 1755.”  Of the\r\nrest of the numerous progeny of this fruitful couple no traces remain.\r\n\r\nA small hamlet in this parish is named Lowthorpe, probably from its\r\nposition; while a farm, belonging to Mr. Robert Harrison, of Horncastle,\r\nwho is Lay-Rector, is named “Sturton Stoup” farm.  This name, however,\r\nhas no connection with the “Stoup,” or holy-water vessel of the church;\r\nbut “Stoup” is a Lincolnshire word, meaning a post, or stake.  The\r\nfarmhouse was, within recent years, a wayside inn, called “The Stoup”;\r\nand the “stoup” was a post, or stake, planted in the middle of an\r\nadjoining green lane to prevent its being used as a thoroughfare.  The\r\nparish was inclosed in 1778.\r\n\r\nThe benefice of Stourton was formerly in the patronage of the Crown, and\r\nthere was a Vicarage house, standing in its own grounds, in what is now\r\nan open field, south of the churchyard.  This was demolished many years\r\nago.  The Vicarage was united to that of Baumber, in the patronage of the\r\nDuke of Newcastle, about the year 1870, the consolidated benefices being\r\nnow in the gift of the Lord Chancellor.  They had, however, been held\r\ntogether by at least three previous incumbents.  The communion plate is\r\nold, although only the chalice bears a date, 1648.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTETFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nTetford, which adjoins Belchford, lies to the north-east of Horncastle,\r\nat a distance of about 7 miles; though a village with a population under\r\n500, it almost aspires to the rank of a small town, as it possesses more\r\nthan one street; has several shops, and a number of fair residences.\r\nLetters _via_ Horncastle, arrive at 10 a.m.  At the date of Domesday\r\nBook, it was one of the limited number of parishes which then possessed a\r\nchurch.  Saxon thanes, by name Elmer, Arnwi and Britrod, held lands here.\r\nThomas, Archbishop of York, formerly a Canon of Baieux, in Normandy, and\r\none of the Conqueror’s Chaplains, received a grant of land here from his\r\nSovereign; and we find his vassal, Gilbert, occupying under him two\r\ncarucates with eight villeins and seven socmen, who had two more\r\ncarucates (240 acres) among them.  The Norman Gozelin, son of Lanbert,\r\nalso held land here, which was occupied by his vassal, Walter, with five\r\nsocmen, and three villeins.  At a later date (13th century) the family of\r\nDe Hesele were proprietors in Tetford, and benefactors to the church,\r\nalso presenting to the benefice of Somersby, as well as to that of\r\nTetford (“Linc. N. & Q.” 1894–5, pp. 228–29).  Then we find the Cormayles\r\nfamily holding lands here, and presenting to Somersby.  The Crevequers,\r\nand the Brayboeufs had the presentation to a chapelry here, of St.\r\nBartholomew, besides owning land.  After them followed the Barkworths,\r\nand to them succeeded the Thimbelbies.  In the Court of Ward’s\r\nInquisitions (3, 4, and 5, Edwd. VI., vol. v., 91) we find Matthew\r\nThimbleby, who married Anne, daughter of Sir Robert Hussey, about 1521,\r\nseised of the advowsons of Tetford and Somersby; and his widow married\r\nSir Robert Savile, Knt., who (through her apparently) was seised\r\n(according to Chancery Inquisition, post mort., 28 Eliz., 1st part, No.\r\n116) of the manors of Tetford, Somersby, and several others.  Sir Robert\r\ndisposed of some of the property thus acquired, selling Tetford to George\r\nAnton, Esq., through whose daughter Elizabeth, married to Sir Edward\r\nHussey, the property passed to the Hussey family, whose head, Lord\r\nHussey, of Sleaford, for his treachery at the time of the Lincolnshire\r\nRebellion, was attainted and executed, by Henry VIII.  A widow, Elizabeth\r\nHussey, presented to the benefice as late as 1690.  For many years a\r\nbranch of the Dymoke family were located at Tetford, until, under the\r\nwill of the late Lionel Dymoke, they succeeded to the Scrivelsby\r\nproperty, and removed to Scrivelsby Court.  Sir Hugh A. H. Cholmeley is\r\nnow lord of the manor, but the principal landowners are Meaburn\r\nStaniland, Esq., F. S. Dymoke, Esq., the executors of George Westerby,\r\nand many small freeholders.  There was formerly a Tetford Literary Club,\r\nhaving as its members most of the gentry of the neighbourhood; one of\r\nwhom, Langhorne Burton, of Somersby, celebrated the association in an\r\namusing poem, of some 200 lines, published in 1772.  It is given in\r\nWeir’s History, of date 1828.  Dr. Samuel Johnson attended the meetings\r\nof this club, when visiting the Langtons of Langton Hall; and he is said\r\nto have played skittles at the White Hart Inn, in Tetford.  There are\r\ntraces of an ancient encampment in this parish, probably the scene of\r\nstruggles between Britons and Saxons.  It lies between the two main\r\nstreets, to the south, and on one side is skirted by a beck which forms\r\none of the feeders of the Somersby stream, sung of by Tennyson as “The\r\nBrook.”  Here, Leland (“Collectanea,” vol. i., pt. 2., p. 509) states\r\nthat Horsa, brother of Hengist, the Saxon General, was defeated by the\r\nBritons, under Raengeires; and the name, like that of Belchford, would\r\nseem to be of British origin; “Tat” being a Druid deity, and “fford”\r\nmeaning a road.\r\n\r\nThe church, dedicated to St. Mary, is a structure of Spilsby sandstone,\r\nof some considerable antiquity, and of larger proportions than most of\r\nthose in the immediate neighbourhood.  For many years it has been in a\r\nsadly neglected condition, although of late it has been somewhat\r\nimproved.  It is capable of being made an edifice fully worthy of divine\r\nworship.  The Puritan square pews survive for the most part; and a\r\nwestern gallery, or singing loft, now disused.  The nave has north and\r\nsouth aisles of three bays, and a clerestory above.  These, with the\r\ntower, are in the Perpendicular style; the south aisle has some Decorated\r\nfeatures; and a lancet window in its west end, in which a crocheted open\r\ncanopy has been introduced, tells of a still earlier church.  The north\r\naisle was rebuilt on the old foundations in 1826.  The chancel arch has a\r\ncontinuous moulding, without capitals.  A closed arch in the north\r\nchancel walls shews a former chantry on that side.  The east window is\r\nmodern.  There are traces in the south aisle indicating a former chantry\r\naltar.  The font is a plain octagon, the basin relieved by foliage at\r\neach angle.  On the south wall of the nave is a monument to Captain\r\nEdward Dymoke, cousin to Champion Lewis Dymoke, who died 1739; with\r\nbreastplate and helmet suspended above.  There are three other Dymoke\r\ntablets; and one to J. Emeris, Fellow of Corpus xsti. College, Rector,\r\nand Head Master of Louth Grammar School.  The tower is massive, somewhat\r\nlow, though well-proportioned.  It has small corner pinnacles, and\r\nimmense gurgoyles.  On the right of the doorway, within the west porch,\r\nis a stoup, rising from a stone bench.  There are three bells; one weighs\r\n1 ton, 1 cwt., 3 qrs., 7 lbs., and has the inscription “Sancta Maria, ora\r\npro nobis”; the second bell weighs 16½ cwts.; the third weighs 11 cwts.,\r\ncast at Barton, by Harrison.  The Sanctus bell stands on the floor.  One\r\nof these bells is said to have formerly belonged to the church at\r\nFulletby, when there was a larger fabric there than at present.  In 1887\r\na Jubilee clock was put up, by subscription, made by Messrs. Maddison and\r\nBlythe, of Horncastle.  In 1903 the present rector, the Rev. W. Wood,\r\ninaugurated, by a bazaar, a scheme for the much needed restoration of\r\nthis church, in which, it is to be hoped, he may be successful.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the church is the base, and part of the shaft, of a\r\nchurchyard cross.  Upon the former, several shields are cut; one of\r\nthese, within a quatrefoil panel, bears three bars in pale, four mullets\r\nbendwise; and upon another is the same bearing, impaling a cinquefoil,\r\nbetween 6 crosses plain.  These were the Thimbleby bearings.\r\n\r\nTetford has been the scene of traditionary witchcraft, the following\r\nanecdote having been related by a quondam inhabitant, whose widow still\r\nsurvives.  It has some resemblance to the story of the phantom hare at\r\nBolingbroke Castle.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, there lived in Tetford an old woman possessed of\r\nmagical powers.  It was said that she could assume the form of a hare,\r\nand, emerging from her cottage through the “cat hole” in the door, could\r\nroam the country round at will.  She had a son who was given to poaching.\r\nThe events on a particular occasion are recorded as follows: “Two men are\r\nwalking on the road from Somersby to Tetford in the evening; one carries\r\na gun.  Just in front a hare passes through the hedge, and comes into the\r\nroad.  “Bang at her, Jack,” says Joe.  Jack puts gun to shoulder, and\r\naims, but for some reason, does not fire.  He lowers his gun, then tries\r\nagain, but with the same result.  “Dal it, Joe,” says Jack, “I cannot;\r\nsummat stops me.  Tack thou the gun!”  Joe seizes the gun, but the hare\r\nis, by this time, nearly out of shot.  However, he fires, and exclaims,\r\n“Its noa goa, she’s hit i’ the leg, but it woant stop her.”  They quicken\r\ntheir steps, lest the shot might have attracted a keeper.  Jack goes to\r\nthe cottage where his mother lives, while Joe goes to his home further\r\ndown the “street.”  Jack goes to the pantry and empties a very roomy\r\npocket, inside his fustian coat, of its contents, we will not say what.\r\nHe brings out a mug of ale, and sits down by the fire, to enjoy it.  His\r\nmother is sitting on the other side of the fire, rather doubled up in her\r\nchair, and with a look of pain on her wrinkled face, “What’s up Mother?”\r\nasks Jack.  “I’ve a bad pain i’ my leg,” she says, “it came on all of a\r\nsudden, a few minutes ago.”  “Rub it wi’ some o’ them oils ye’ve got,”\r\nsays Jack; “Let’s hev supper, and then ye’d better goa to bed.”  “I’ve\r\nhed my supper,” she says, “ye were so long o’ coming, that I did’nt wait\r\no’ ye, an’ I’ll goa to bed now.”  She gets up with difficulty, hobbles\r\nacross the room, and slowly mounts the “lether” (ladder) to her bedroom.\r\nJack gets his supper, and then goes out to the ale-house not far off, for\r\na final pot, and chat, before “turning in.”  There he meets Joe, and they\r\nhave a pipe together.  In the course of conversation Jack says, “Mother’s\r\nbad i’ the leg, she was ta’en all of a sudden a little afore I comed\r\nhoam.”  Joe laughs, and says, “I’d upode it, she’s bewitched hersen,\r\ninstead of some un else.”  Next morning the old woman does not get up.\r\nShe calls to Jack, he goes to her, “My leg is worser, gie me some tea,\r\nand then goa to the wise man at the town an’ ask him what’s the matter\r\nwi’ me, for I feel that queer.  Get my stocking out o’ yon chest, and\r\nI’ll gie thee a crown to gie him for his fee.”  To be brief, Jack attends\r\nto her wants, gets his breakfast, and walks off some miles to the\r\nneighbouring town.  There he has a jug of ale, to refresh him after his\r\nwalk, and so goes to the wise man.  He finds him at home, and tells his\r\nerrand.  The wise man takes him into a back room, tells him to sit down,\r\nwhile he lays out a big book on the table, and opens it at random.  Jack\r\ncannot read, but he would not be any wiser in this case, if he could, for\r\nthe page is covered with curious characters, which none but the wise man\r\ncan read, and a sceptic might suggest that he cannot either.  The latter\r\nthen turns to a cupboard in the corner of the room, opens the door of it,\r\nput his head inside, and _sotto voce_, mumbles something.  Having done\r\nthis for a moment or two, as if conversing with some “familiar spirit” in\r\nan unknown tongue, he throws the cupboard door wide open, whereupon out\r\nflies a large “bumble-bee,” which circles, buzzing, round the room, and\r\nat length settles on the open book.  The wise man examines the particular\r\nletters, or characters, on which the bee has settled.  Having studied\r\nthem carefully, he says to Jack, “When did your mother first feel the\r\npain?”  “Last night,” says Jack,” afore I came home to supper.”  “When\r\ndid you shoot that hare?” asks the wise man.  “I did not shoot a hare at\r\nall,” replied Jack.  The wise man consults the characters again, and then\r\nsays “No!  I see you did not, but it was your gun that shot her.”  At\r\nthis Jack is astonished, and tells the whole particulars.  The wise man\r\nsays, “your good spirit kept you from shooting, because she was your own\r\nmother, but your mate shot her with your own gun.  Don’t you know that\r\nyour mother’s a witch, and goes out as a hare whenever she likes?  Why, I\r\nheard of her running across the road in front of a team of horses, in her\r\nform of a hare and they were so scared that they nearly dragged the\r\nwaggon into a dyke.  However,” he adds,” she’ll soon be well again.\r\nHere’s the remedy: Catch a hedgehog, take a comb, and with it saw off one\r\nof its legs, and tell her to rub her leg well with the hedgehog’s leg,\r\nand the pain will soon go.”  Jack journeyed home in high spirits, taking\r\na pot or two on the way, by way of self-congratulation; and my informant\r\ndeponeth that all came about as the wise man foretold.\r\n\r\nOutside the boundary of Tetford, to the west, and strictly speaking in\r\nthe parish of Salmonby, a number of flint arrow-heads have been found on\r\nWarlow farm, near a spot named “Warlow Camp.”  They are of a trilobite\r\nform, finely chipped, and about one inch in length, three-quarters of an\r\ninch broad at base.  They belong to the neolithic period; and from the\r\nvery crisp character of the chipping, it is evident that they have not\r\nbeen used; there was probably a factory of such implements on the spot.\r\nSeveral specimens may be seen at the house of Mr. Westerby, tenant of the\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWADDINGWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaddingworth is a small village, about 6 miles from Horncastle, in a\r\nnorth-westerly direction, between Gautby and Wispington.  The church,\r\ndedicated to St. Margaret, is now in a very dilapidated condition.  The\r\nrectory is held at the present time (1904) by the Rev. L. Dewhurst, along\r\nwith that of Gautby, where he has a fairly commodious house, with\r\npermission from the Bishop to hold only occasional services at\r\nWaddingworth Church, as that at Gautby is almost equally convenient for\r\nthe people of both parishes.\r\n\r\nThe register dates from 1640, but entries are found in the registers of\r\nBaumber, for this parish, from 1695 to 1779.  At Bardney is the nearest\r\npostal and telegraph office.  Letters come _via_ Horncastle.  It is\r\naltogether a very out-of-the-way spot.\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of Waddingworth is probably shown in its name, which,\r\naccording to some, consists of the Saxon “Wodin” (or “Odin”), their God\r\nof war (which name also appears in our Wednesday, or Wodin’s day), and\r\nthe Saxon “worth,” an inclosure, which also appears in several\r\nplace-names in the neighbourhood, as Benniworth, Faldingworth,\r\nHag-_worth_-_ing_ham.  The last of these names, however, suggests a\r\nderivation which I am inclined to think more probable.  Divide the name\r\ninto three elements, and we get wad, or “woad,” a plant greatly valued by\r\nthe Britons, who dyed their bodies with it (and which name would continue\r\nthrough the Saxon period, as it does still), and “ing,” Saxon for meadow,\r\nand “worth,” Saxon for enclosure, the whole meaning an “enclosed field of\r\nwoad”; enclosed, doubtless, because of the value of the woad.  It is\r\nstill a valuable crop, and frequently mixed with the Indian “Indigo.”\r\n\r\nThe earliest actual mention of Waddingworth is in Domesday Book, in which\r\nthere are two references to it.  In one of these we are told that the\r\nConqueror gave part of the parish to the proud and powerful Bishop of\r\nDurham, William de Karilepho, A.D. 1082, who was also Chief Justice of\r\nEngland.  There were 4 carucates of land, _i.e._, 480 acres, rateable to\r\ngelt (a very small tax), the whole being 6 carucates, or 720 acres, with\r\n20 acres of meadow (“ings”) and 25 acres of underwood.  The other notice\r\nis that the same amount of land was given by the Conqueror to one of his\r\ndistinguished Norman soldiers, Eudo the son of Spirewic.  Eudo, it will\r\nbe remembered, was a comrade in arms of Pinco, the latter of whom\r\nacquired large property in the neighbourhood of Spilsby, and his\r\ndescendants eventually became the Lords Willoughby d’ Eresby (_i.e._,\r\nSpilsby).  Eudo received the manor of Tattershall and several others, one\r\nof these being a moiety of Waddingworth.  He was the founder of Kirkstead\r\nAbbey, which he richly endowed.  This leads to a curious coincidence.\r\nDr. Oliver, the learned writer of “The Religious Houses on the Witham,”\r\nmentions that among the possessions of Tupholme Abbey were lands in\r\nWaddingworth.  What more natural than that, in days when spending one’s\r\nwealth on so-called religious works was a passport to heaven for the\r\ngiver, and for his forefathers or his descendants, Eudo should have\r\ndevoted some of his wealth to the Religious House at Tupholme, as well as\r\nto the Religious House at Kirkstead?  Tupholme was founded by two\r\nbrothers, Alan and Gilbert de Nevil, in 1160, Kirkstead was founded 1139.\r\nAt the dissolution of the monasteries, Henry VIII. seized monastic\r\nproperty, and this is why we find the King as Patron of Waddingworth in\r\n“Liber Regis,” and also in much later authorities.  It is, indeed, now in\r\nthe patronage of the Lord Chancellor, as representing the crown.  The\r\nConqueror seized it by the right of conquest; Henry VIII. seized it as\r\nthe plunderer of monasteries.  This carries us down to nearly the middle\r\nof the 16th century.  There were, however, other small proprietors who\r\nowned land, besides these two prominent parties.  At an early period,\r\nthere is a “Final Concord,” so called, or agreement, of the 13th century,\r\nas follows:—“On October 19, A.D. 1200, Petronilla, the widow of Richard\r\nde Waddingworth, claimed of Robert de Waddingworth, tenant of a 3rd part,\r\nviz., 20 oxgangs (or 300 acres), with 6 tofts, in Waddingworth, besides\r\nlands in Bucknall and Horsington, as her dower, given to her by her late\r\nhusband, the said Richard; and Robert surrendered all claim to the lands\r\nin favour of the said Petronilla for her life, for which Petronilla gave\r\nhim 2½ marks.”  After the dissolution of the monasteries, though the\r\ncrown retained the patronage of the benefice, the land seems to have\r\npassed into several other hands.  In 1559, Roger Fulstow, of\r\nWaddingworth, claimed of his sovereign, Queen Elizabeth, protection\r\nagainst the outrages committed by the mad Earl of Lincoln, who lived at\r\nTattershall; and was well known for his violent proceedings towards the\r\nSaviles of Poolham, and others. {219a}  He (Fulstow) was afterwards sent\r\non an embassy to the Landgrave of Hesse.  Macaulay, the historian, says\r\nthat a Fulstow, of Waddingworth, incurred the displeasure of Henry VIII.,\r\nand was punished, though he does not say how.  This was probably the same\r\nman earlier in life, and the employment of him, by Elizabeth, shows that,\r\nhaving annoyed the father, he recovered the favour of the daughter.  But\r\neven earlier than this, Thomas Dighton, of Waddingworth, gent. (son of\r\nEdmund Dighton, and grandson of Robert Dighton, lord of the manor of\r\nStourton) was intimate with the Dymokes, and was visiting at Scrivelsby\r\nCourt at the time of the “Lincolnshire Rising,” against Henry VIII.\r\n(otherwise called the Pilgrimage of Grace), in 1536, which led to the\r\nmerry monarch pronouncing his well-known criticism on the men of\r\nLincolnshire, that they were “the most beastly in all the realm.”  These\r\nDightons came of a mercantile stock in Lincoln, where they were Mayors\r\nand Sheriffs, and amassed large fortunes.  One of them, Robert, of\r\nStourton, married Joyce {219b} St. Paul (or vulgarly Sampoole), daughter\r\nand heiress of William St. Paul of Snarford, who was also involved in the\r\nRising aforesaid; the chief member of the family being Sir George St.\r\nPaul, who died childless in 1614, when, with him, the family became\r\nextinct.  In the lists of those gentry who contributed to the defence of\r\nthe country, when the Spanish Armada was expected, are the names of G.\r\nSt. Paul, who contributed “1 lance, and 2 light horse”; while Thomas\r\nDighton, of Waddingworth, of that day, contributed also 1 lance, and 1\r\nlight horse.  In the year 1546, Robert Hoberthorn, a native of\r\nWaddingworth, became Lord Mayor of London (“Weir’s History,” vol. i., p.\r\n313.)  We have an early presentation to the Benefice of Waddingworth, in\r\nJohn Smith, clerk, appointed by Queen Elizabeth to the Rectory, _vacant\r\nby the resignation of Thomas Rumney_; this institution took place in\r\n1563. {220a}  This notice implies a good deal more than it contains to\r\nthe uninitiated.  Thomas Rumney had doubtless to resign, or rather was\r\nexpelled from his living by “the bloody” Queen Mary, because he was a\r\nProtestant, and the living, like many others, remained for some years\r\nvacant, until the Protestant Queen Elizabeth, succeeding her sister Mary,\r\nhad time to look about her, and she in 1562 filled the vacancy by\r\ninstituting John Smith.\r\n\r\nIn the Stixwould Register there is an entry relating to Waddingworth,\r\nstating that Mr. George Townshend died at Halstead Hall, and was buried\r\nat Waddingworth “on Wensdaie night, the 13 of February, 1627.”  The cause\r\nof this is supposed to have been, that he was a Romanist, and therefore\r\ncould not legally be buried at a Protestant place of worship.  Mr.\r\nRutland Snowden, and Mrs. Frances Townshend, were married “the 25\r\nDecember, being Christmas daie, 1628.”  This looks rather as if, after a\r\nyear’s delay after the death of Mr. G. Townshend, to be respectable, Mrs.\r\nTownshend, his widow, married Mr. Rutland Snowden. {220b}  I find another\r\nrecord that Mr. George Townshend of Halstead Hall, by will, dated 1627\r\n(he evidently dying rather suddenly) left his land in Waddingworth to his\r\nsecond son, George, the executor being Nicholas Larke, parson of\r\nWaddingworth.  This Mrs. Townshend was the widow of an Evington of\r\nHalstead Hall, so that she had three husbands, Rutland Snowden being the\r\nlast, and by him she had several children.  He was the son of the Bishop\r\nof Carlisle.  They lived, it is recorded, at Horncastle, as they\r\nnaturally would do, the Bishop being then officially the Lord of the\r\nManor of Horncastle, having his episcopal residence near the present\r\nmanor house.  He was buried at Horncastle in 1654, and his wife in 1658.\r\nRichard Evington, of Halstead Hall, according to an old record, on his\r\ndeath in 1612, left 40_s._ to Abdeel and Joel Larke, sons of the\r\nabove-named Mr. Nicholas Larke, parson, of Waddingworth.  The will of\r\nGeorge Snowdon, of Waddingworth, was proved in 1704.  He left his lands\r\nin Waddingworth and Horsington to his nephew, Edward Dymoke, of Lincoln,\r\ngentleman, and to his heirs.  It is not clear who this George Snowdon\r\nwas, but Jane Snowden, granddaughter of Rutland and Frances Snowden,\r\nmarried Charles Dymoke, of Scrivelsby, and died childless in 1743; and\r\nAbigail Snowden, daughter of the same Rutland and Frances Snowden,\r\nmarried Edward Dymoke, younger son of Sir Edward Dymoke, of Scrivelsby,\r\nfrom whom sprang the Tetford branch, who now hold the property of\r\nScrivelsby and the Championship; and so Waddingworth passed to the\r\nDymokes.  There is still a tablet in the church of Waddingworth referring\r\nto these parties.  It is a slab of black marble in the pavement, in the\r\ncentre of the nave, and runs as follows:—“Here lyes ye body of Edward\r\nDymoke, Esq., son of Edward Dymoke, of Tumby, in the County of Lincoln,\r\nEsq., grandson of the Honble. Sir Edward Dymoke, Champion of England.  He\r\nmarried Mary, daughter and co-heiress of John Lodington, Esq., {221}\r\nrelict of Captain Booth, of Market Rasen, in the county of Lincoln, and\r\ndied April 29, A.D. 1729, aged 78 years, leaving Jane, his only surviving\r\ndaughter and heir, married to Edward Southwell, Esq. of Wisbeach, in the\r\ncounty of Cambridge.  Here also lies interred Abigail, daughter of the\r\nsaid Edward Dymoke and Mary his wife, who died March 22nd, A.D. 1708,\r\naged 17 years.”  Above this inscription are the crest, a sword and\r\nmantle, and on the shield, two lions, crowned, passant.  In course of\r\ntime the manor passed, through the above marriage, to Edward Southwell,\r\nof the Trafford Southwell family, who now live at Wroxham, in Norfolk,\r\nand who, with the Vyners of Gautby, own the parish.\r\n\r\nThe old Manor House, or Hall, stood in the centre of the parish, and was\r\nat one time occupied by the Calthrop family, until they removed to West\r\nAshby Manor, near Horncastle; the last of them residing there is\r\nremembered by the present writer, and there is a memorial in Ashby Church\r\nof Richard Calthrop, an officer who fell during the siege of Algiers.\r\nJohn Calthrop afterwards removed to Stanhoe Hall, in Norfolk.  The old\r\nHall of Waddingworth was a ruin 60 years ago, and afterwards pulled down.\r\nThe outline of it can still be traced.  The interesting old Rectory, of\r\nmud and stud, still survives as a cottage, to the north of the\r\nchurchyard.  There is an inverted base of a churchyard cross still\r\nremaining on the south side of the Church.  Over the west door, which is\r\nof the Perpendicular style, but sadly dilapidated, is a reticulated\r\nwindow, and above that, let into the wall, is an Early English tombstone,\r\nor, more probably, a “consecration cross,” carved as a “cross flory,” in\r\nheraldic phrase.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded that some ancient armour was some years ago found in a\r\ncottage in the parish, consisting of the helmet, breast-plate,\r\nback-piece, and gorget of a cavalier, probably a fugitive from the battle\r\nof Winceby.\r\n\r\nThe Church, although now so dilapidated, was rebuilt in 1808, the\r\nprevious edifice having been a much handsomer and larger structure.\r\n\r\nThere was a very remarkable case of robbery, which occurred near this\r\nparish, on January 2nd, 1841, and which is recorded in the “Stamford\r\nMercury,” of March 12th, of that year, with which we may fitly close our\r\nrecords of Waddingworth.\r\n\r\nMr. James Turner, a considerable farmer, of Waddingworth, declared, on\r\nhis own public affidavit, that he was attacked by robbers when riding\r\nhome from Horncastle market, for, be it remembered, gigs were then little\r\nused; men rode to and from market, and carried their wives behind them on\r\npillions (as the present writer has frequently seen, as a boy).  To use\r\nMr. Turner’s words, he said, “When I had proceeded a quarter-of-a-mile\r\nthrough the village of Thimbleby (which he needs must pass), a little\r\nafter 6 o’clock, p.m., I observed three men, walking in the middle of the\r\nroad, about 100 yards before me.  I was riding at a canter, as it was\r\nmoonlight.  Two of the men walked in the ‘ruts,’ on either side, and one\r\nin the middle.  He was a little behind the others, and he remained so,\r\ntill I nearly rode over him.  I tried to turn out of the road, to avoid\r\nhim, but I then found he had seized my horse by the rein.  The two men\r\nsaid ‘good night,’ and I replied to the same effect.  I then said to the\r\nman, ‘What!  Are you going to rob me?’  He made no reply, and I struck\r\nhim with my stick on the head.  The mare I was riding then began to\r\nplunge, and the other two took hold of me, and dragged me from my saddle.\r\nI lit on my feet, but the mare got away.  I struggled with the men, and\r\ngot away from them.  The two stood on my left, and as I saw the third\r\ncoming in on my right, I struck at him, and he for the moment gave way,\r\nbut then, supported by the others, he again sprang at me, and seized me\r\nby the collar (which in those days were large).  The three then threw me\r\nto the ground, and placed a stick across my throat, and so kept me down.\r\nThey hurt me considerably, but I lifted the stick across my throat to my\r\nchin, which was much bruised.  They then tore my waistcoat open and took\r\nfrom my pocket a book containing blank cheques and memorandums, and my\r\ngame license.  On this, they began muttering among themselves, and the\r\none who first attacked me, said, ‘Where’s your money?’  I threw myself,\r\nas much as I could, on one side, to protect my ‘fob,’ but they tore my\r\nbreeches open, and took from my right-hand pocket two canvas purses, in\r\none of which I had two notes and some silver, and in the other £5 in\r\ngold.  They took all this, and an old-fashioned silver watch, and some\r\nloose coins besides.  I begged them not to murder me.  They took from my\r\nmackintosh a small bundle and threw it on the road, which contained my\r\nbanking book and memorandum book, both of which I subsequently recovered.\r\nThey then struck, or kicked, me violently in the ribs, and ran through a\r\ngate into a field, towards Edlington.”\r\n\r\nMr. Turner testified to his recognising the men, as it was a moonlight\r\nnight, and he had seen one of them before, in Bucknall, an almost\r\nadjoining parish.  Further evidence was very strong against them.  Anne\r\nDawson, whose husband kept the “Nag’s Head” Inn, at Bardney, proved that,\r\nearlier on the same day, three men had called at the Inn, for\r\nrefreshment, and took the road for Thimbleby.  Joseph Aukland also\r\ntestified that, in returning from Horncastle market, the same evening, he\r\nsaw the men only a few yards from the spot, before the robbery took\r\nplace.  At the “Ram” Inn, at Stourton, three men called about 8.30 p.m.,\r\nto have some ale, for which they paid, apparently (as was noticed) having\r\nplenty of money, and asked their way to Market Rasen.  On the next\r\nmorning, Sunday, at 7.30 a.m., one of them entered the “White Hart,” the\r\nleading hotel in Rasen, and had refreshment.  Later, two of them called\r\nat a shop at Glentham, and produced two £5 notes (such as were stolen).\r\nThey were then on their way to Gainsborough.  They subsequently went to\r\nthe “Dog and Gun” Inn at that place, and the landlord changed a £5 note\r\nfor them, and a Mrs. Watson another of the same value.  One of them, next\r\nday, bought a new coat at Gainsborough, for £4 13_s._; one prisoner was\r\ntaken at Lynn, in Norfolk, wearing the said coat; and the others were\r\nsubsequently captured, where is not stated.  The Judge pronounced the\r\nevidence to be most decisive, and the sentence was “Transportation for\r\nLife.”  The victim of this outrage arrived at his home late that night,\r\nin rather a sorry plight.  I think readers of this account will agree\r\nthat Mr. James Turner made a very brave stand against such odds.  He must\r\nhave been a powerful man, as his son, Mr. Jabez Turner, certainly was in\r\nhis day.  I have myself been inside the house, for refreshment, of Mr.\r\nJames Turner when shooting on the farm, but the robbery took place before\r\nI was old enough to carry a gun.  So end our annals of Waddingworth, with\r\nnot the least stirring incident in its history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWINCEBY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWinceby is situated about five miles south-east of Horncastle, on the way\r\nto Old Bolingbroke.  It is approached by a good road, but leading up and\r\ndown hills so steep as to render travelling slow, either for man or\r\nbeast.  The village itself stands on high ground commanding very\r\nextensive views; the church of West Keal being a conspicuous object to\r\nthe east; the lofty tower of Boston looming in the distance, southward,\r\nmany miles away; Tattershall Castle and Church, the churches of\r\nConingsby, Heckington, and others in the Sleaford direction being also\r\nvisible, beyond the extensive tracts of fen barred by woods, which\r\nintervene; while, on a clear day, the prospect extends across the Wash to\r\nthe low-lying coast of Norfolk.  Northward stretches a tract, less\r\nextensive, of varied, undulating ground, with the wooded heights of\r\nWarden Hill, Brinkhill, &c., forming the distant elevated horizon.  In\r\nearly spring, or on a bright autumnal day, it would be difficult to find\r\na wider range of view, or more varied colouring, to please the eye.  The\r\nparish is small, being but little more than 800 acres in extent,\r\ncomprised in one large farm, the homestead of which, a large, lofty, and\r\nsomewhat bleak-looking house, occupied by Mr. Edwd. Patchett, forms, with\r\nits surrounding buildings and well-filled stackyard, a prominent feature.\r\nYet this humble village has had its associations in the past of more than\r\nordinary interest.\r\n\r\nThere are few parishes which have not some tradition connected with the\r\nsupernatural; and here, on the left of the road to Winceby, in a hollow\r\nin Slash Lane, about half-a-mile before reaching the village, there stood\r\nuntil recent years a large boulder in the field close by.  It was\r\nsupposed to cover hidden treasure, and various attempts were made at\r\ndifferent times to remove it, sometimes with six, or even eight horses.\r\nAt one of these attempts, his Satanic Majesty, having been invoked by the\r\nlocal title of “Old Lad,” appeared, it is said, in person, whereupon the\r\nstone fell back, upsetting the horses.  On another occasion a black\r\nmouse, probably the same Being incarnate, in another form (compare\r\nassistance rendered by a black mouse to the devil, in Goethe’s Faust),\r\nran over the gearing of the horses, with a similar result.  Eventually,\r\nas a last resort, to break the spell, the boulder was buried, and now no\r\ntrace of boulder, black mouse, or Satan’s (Linc. “Samuel’s”) foot-print\r\nremains.\r\n\r\nDomesday Book records that the Saxon Agemund held lands here, and in the\r\nadjoining Claxby Pluckacre; and that Walter, a vassal of the wealthy\r\nNorman Gozelin, also held land and a mill of the yearly value of 4_s._,\r\nwhile the still more powerful Norman, Hugh de Abrincis (Avranches, in\r\nFrance), Earl of Chester, also received a grant of land in this parish\r\nfrom his uncle, William the Conqueror.  Of this “Baron bold,” we may\r\nobserve, in passing, that he acquired the surname of Lupus, or “the\r\nwolf,” from his many daring deeds.  In addition to almost the whole of\r\nthe county of Chester, which gave him his title, he held about 20 manors\r\nin Lincolnshire, 22 in Leicestershire, 12 in Norfolk, 32 in Suffolk,\r\nbesides several more in other counties.  Indeed, so large were his\r\npossessions, and so great his power, that the terms of the royal grant to\r\nhim stated that he held his properties, not “de capite,” or “in chief,”\r\nof the Sovereign, as was almost universally the case, but “tam libere ad\r\ngladium, sicut Rex ipse tenebat Angliam ad coronam,” _i.e._, as freely by\r\nhis sword, as the King did by his crown.  It is recorded of him, that he\r\nfounded and endowed several monasteries, in England, and elsewhere, “for\r\nthe good and salvation of his soul”; and it is näively added, that “if a\r\ntithe of that be true which is related of him by the Chronicler,\r\nOrdericus Vitalis (p. 787), he had needs enough to make some such amends\r\nfor his doings.”  He, however, seems, in his latter days, to have\r\nattained to a proper sense of his actions, since he closed his career,\r\nafter a long illness, by adopting the tonsure, as a monk of the Abbey of\r\nSt. Werberg, of Chester, in his own Barony.  Few of these baronial\r\npossessions, however, remained long in the families of those favourites\r\nto whom they were granted by the Conqueror, solely by the right of\r\nconquest.  It had been asked long before, even by a Jezebel, “Had Zimri\r\npeace, who slew his master?”  And there were Norman Omris and Zimris.  It\r\nwas a matter of natural, as well as of retributive justice, that, when\r\nthe grip, by which the strong held his own, lost its vigour, even the\r\nstrongest should make way for “a stronger than he.”  And although the\r\nproud Lupus lorded it over demesnes in Hag, Salmonby, Tetford, Brinkhill,\r\nLangton, Greetham, and in many another parish, beside Winceby, yet at a\r\nlater period we find another powerful family, the Gaunts, in the\r\nascendant, and the Duke of Lancaster, John de Gandivo, was “Dominus\r\nManerii de Winceby” (Harl. MS., Brit. Mus., vol. iii., p. 770); and\r\nWalter de Gaunt granted to the Abbey of Bardney, which had been\r\nre-founded by his father, Gilbert de Gaunt, after being in ruins some 200\r\nyears, the tithes of his Fee in Winceby.  (Dugdale’s “Monasticon” ed.\r\n1682, p. 143).  But not yet even was “fixity of tenure” a feature of the\r\ntimes.  Every dog has (only) his day; other owners followed not now\r\nknown, and Winceby is now also owned by a name unknown to fame in the\r\nrepresentative of the Hill family, who purchased the estate from C.\r\nManwaring, Esq.  But the Domus Dei should be a spot undesecrated by\r\nearthly broils, a fold unviolated by “the wolf,” and although the Church,\r\nerected at Winceby, possibly by the proud Lupus himself, “for the good of\r\nhis soul,” has, in its original fabric, passed away, yet there still\r\nstands on the same site, a place of worship, small indeed, but not\r\nunworthy of its holy purpose.  Dedicated to St. Margaret, the special\r\nSaint of purity undefiled, {227} it fitly stands on an isolated knoll,\r\nwhich on one side looks down on a deep gorge; with the few cottages of\r\nthe, some 60, inhabitants clustering near at hand; with the great farm\r\nhouse, Winceby hall, standing out eastward, and the picturesque modern\r\nRectory, peacefully embowered in trees and shrubbery, one field away to\r\nthe west, the calm and comfortable retreat of the Rev. C. E. Bolam,\r\nRector of Lusby, the Rector of Winceby being the Rev. Brice-Smith,\r\nresident at Hameringham.\r\n\r\nUntil recent years, the church had, in the course of time, degenerated\r\ninto a small, mean thatched edifice; but, during the late incumbency of\r\nthe Rev. William Wordsworth Talfourd, acting in the spirit of that “high\r\npriest of nature,” whose name he bore, the fabric was reconstructed in\r\nearly English style; the nave being built at the expense of the late Mr.\r\nCharles Hill, of Winceby House, and the chancel by the rector.  It\r\nconsists of nave, chancel, porch, and bell turret.  Its chief features\r\nare as follows:—In the north wall of the nave are two pairs of narrow\r\npointed windows, within debased arches; the south wall has the same, with\r\na porch, having narrow pointed arch.  The font, of stone, has a circular\r\nbowl, relieved by four small quatrefoils, at the four quarters, a\r\ncircular shaft, and square pediment.  The west window is a cinquefoil,\r\nsurrounded by eight small quatrefoils.  The pulpit and seats are of light\r\ndeal.  The east window of the chancel, the gift of Miss Talfourd, is of\r\nthree distinct trefoiled compartments, of coloured glass, the central one\r\nrather larger than the other two, and surmounted by a quatrefoil.  The\r\nsubjects are, in the centre, the Crucifixion; in the northern one, Christ\r\nblessing little children; in the southern, the Last Supper.  In the south\r\nwall of the chancel is a single-light trefoil, window, with three small\r\nquatrefoils above; its subject being, Christ and the Magdalen, or “Noli\r\nme tangere”; a brass tablet states that this is “in memory of Frances\r\nTalfourd, March 9, 1862.”  The sedilia in the chancel are of handsome,\r\nmodern, substantial oak.  The roof throughout is of pitch pine.  The one\r\nbell hangs in a turret supported by eight pilasters.  The living is in\r\nthe gift of the Lord Chancellor.  The register dates from 1579.  Among\r\nthe entries are the following:—“1773, Thursday, June 28th, — Spenly\r\nburied.  He was servant to Thomas English, and instantly killed with\r\nthunder and lightening in the house of his master, about 5 o’clock the\r\nevening before.”  In the two following, we do not see the object of the\r\nfinancial computation, unless the party making the entry was\r\nhypochondriac on the subject of £ s. d.  “1698 Mary daughter of Tho.\r\nJeffery, ffarmer (not worth six hundred pounds) and Anne, his wife,\r\nbaptised, October 23rd.”  “1699.  A similiar entry of John Bowsley,\r\nffarmer, being not worth £600.”\r\n\r\nThe main interest of Winceby is as being the scene of the decisive\r\nbattle, commonly called “Winceby fight,” between the forces of the\r\nRoyalists and the Parliamentarians which took place on Wednesday, Oct.\r\n11, 1643.\r\n\r\nWe have only space here for a brief account of that engagement, which was\r\nimportant in its effect.  We quote from a curious contemporary record,\r\nwritten by a Parliamentarian, and who apparently took part in the events\r\ndescribed. {228}  The Parliamentary army, then in the neighbourhood of\r\nBoston, after suffering a reverse near Grantham, and gaining a doubtful\r\nvictory at Gainsborough, had been reinforced by Sir Thomas Fairfax; and\r\nCromwell was also on his way to join it, with a valuable body of horse.\r\nTo prevent this formidable combination, the Marquis of Newcastle from the\r\nnorth, hurried towards Boston, and despatched Sir John Henderson, to\r\nintercept Cromwell.  Forces belonging to both sides had been encamped, on\r\nthe previous night, in Horncastle, Thimbleby, Edlington, and neighbouring\r\nvillages, where skirmishes had occurred.  The main body under Manchester,\r\nhad moved from near Boston to Bolingbroke, which was held by Royalists.\r\nOn the Monday night, Major Knight, in the name of Manchester, had\r\nsummoned the Castle of Bolingbroke (to surrender); but was answered that\r\n“his bug-bear words must not winne castles.”  Whereupon Knight resolved\r\nthe next evening, to break open the Church doors, “and there to mount a\r\nmorter-piece, and fire the Castle.”  But the events of the next day\r\nprevented this.  “Those of the Castle (the Royalists), killed one or two\r\nof our men; and, as Major Knight, and the Quarter-master Generall\r\nVermeyden were viewing of it, made some shots at them, and one of them\r\nhit the said Quarter-master Generall a little below the ancle, but\r\npierced not the skin, only bruised his leg.”  Seeing that they were\r\ndetermined to resist, Manchester then moved to East Kirkby; and his\r\nforces were encamped there, at Stickney, and at different points around.\r\nCromwell was encamped at Winceby, in advance, with his “light horse and\r\ndragooners,” where he passed the night.  The Royalists, under Sir John\r\nHenderson, pressed forward from Horncastle, in order, if possible, to\r\nattack Cromwell, before the main body had come up.  But Cromwell did not\r\nobject to hard blows, and though his “horse were extremly wearied with\r\nhard duty,” he calmly and sternly awaited the event.  “About twelve of\r\nthe clock . . . we began to descry the enemy coming toward us.  So soon\r\nas our men had knowledge of (this), they were very full of joy and\r\nresolution, thinking it a great mercie that they should now fight.\r\nCromwell led the van.”  He gave the watchword “Truth and Peace,” and then\r\ngave out a Psalm; and his troops moved on, singing it, to charge the foe.\r\nThey sustained a hostile fire along the whole of their line, but they\r\nrode on unshaken, at full speed.  A second volley, at close quarters,\r\nkilled Cromwell’s charger; and as he rose to his feet, “he was knockit\r\ndown again by the gentleman who had charged him, who ’twas conceived, was\r\nSir Ingram Hopton;” and for a moment he lay as slain.  But he who, as a\r\nchild, had escaped death in the arms of a monkey, was not to be so easily\r\nextinguished; he recovered consciousness, and mounted a trooper’s horse;\r\nhis opponent, Sir Ingram Hopton, was slain in his turn; and “this first\r\ncharge was so home-given (says the Chronicler), and with so much\r\nadmirable courage and resolution by our troops, that the enemy stood not\r\nanother, but were driven back upon their own body, which was to have\r\nseconded them, and at last put them into a plain disorder; and thus, in\r\nless than half an hour’s fight, they were all quite routed.  Our men\r\npursued, and did execution upon them about five or six miles; all the way\r\nbeing strewed with broken arms, dead men and horses.”  Two hundred horses\r\nwere afterwards found left in Bolingbroke Castle, which had been\r\nabandoned by the Royalists in a panic.  Many hundreds of the defeated\r\nfugitives rushed frantically into “waters up to their arm-holes {230a};\r\nthey that lay slain in the highways were very many; and divers of\r\nqualitie, for there were brave bodies stript naked.  The number of horses\r\ntaken were about 2000, of prisoners about 1000, . . . of arms 1500, and\r\nnot 100 of the enemie (’twas verily believed), to be found in a body; of\r\n94 standards 35 were taken, whereas (he adds), wee but lost very few of\r\nour men, none of note, (and), wee hardly found above one of our officers\r\nhurt.”  With the Puritan’s faith he exclaims, “God himself did it all,\r\ntaking away the enemie’s hearts, and giving resolution and courage to our\r\nmen; to him therefor be all the honour and glory of this famous victory.”\r\n{230b}  This was a greater blow to the Royalist cause than has commonly\r\nbeen estimated.  Hitherto the struggle had been carried on with varied\r\nfortune, but as yet the Royalists had had no reason to despair, and had\r\neven achieved considerable successes.  At Winceby it may be said, the\r\ntide decidedly set in against them.  The struggle was prolonged; but\r\nLincoln was taken by Manchester’s forces in the following May (1644).  In\r\nthe same year was fought the disastrous battle of Marston Moor; and the\r\neven more fatal fight of Naseby in 1645.  After that the issue was almost\r\na foregone conclusion.  As to the actual scene of the fight, the\r\nRoyalists, from Horncastle, would seem to have advanced slightly beyond\r\nthe village, before they encountered the enemy.  The name of “Slash\r\nLane,” westward, still surviving, tells its own tale of their wild flight\r\ntowards the town, which they had so lately left full of high hope.  The\r\n“clap-gate” farm at Holbeck, tells of hurried movements in the dark hours\r\nof the night.  The Winceby registers record no increase of burials at the\r\ntime.  But tradition avers that many were interred by the peasantry on\r\nScrafield hill-top.  The one known burial is that of Sir Ingram Hopton,\r\nwhose body, by order of Cromwell himself, was conveyed to Horncastle,\r\nthat it might be interred in a manner worthy of one, in whom he\r\nrecognised “a brave gentleman.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWISPINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWispington is situated about 4 miles from Horncastle, in a north-westerly\r\ndirection; adjoining Edlington on the east, Baumber on the north,\r\nWaddingworth on the west, and Horsington and Edlington on the south.\r\nLetters arrive from Horncastle at 9 a.m.  The nearest money order office\r\nis at Horncastle, and telegraph office at Baumber.\r\n\r\nLike two of the parishes just mentioned as contiguous, the name of\r\nWispington contains the Anglo-Saxon patronymic “ing.”  A Saxon settler\r\nnamed Uisp, or Wisp, probably took up his residence here; his children\r\nformed the “family” of Uisp, or Wisp-“ing”; and the settlement or\r\nenclosure, which they occupied, was the Uisp-ing-town, or Wispington.\r\n{231}  Under the ruthless rule of William the Conqueror, these early\r\noccupants would be displaced, and their land given to some favourite of\r\nthat King; under whom possibly the late Saxon thane, and his family,\r\nmight, at least, be allowed to labour as serfs.  Accordingly we find, in\r\nthe great survey made for the Conqueror, called “Doomsday Book,” because\r\nit recorded the doom of so many, whom he subjugated, or dispossessed, two\r\nmentions of this parish.  The first of these, places it amongst the\r\npossessions of William de Karilepho, who had been Abbot of St. Vincent,\r\nbut was promoted by the Conqueror to the Bishopric of Durham, as well as\r\nbeing made Chief Justice of England.  Old Chroniclers say that he was a\r\nman of great determination, but regulated by judgment; and he ingratiated\r\nhimself with the King, who gave him large possessions in Lincolnshire,\r\nand other counties; a quarrel, however, with the succeeding King, Rufus,\r\nso wounded his pride, that he died of chagrin.  He held of the King, a\r\nlarge part of this parish, viz., 4 carucates (or 480 acres), 2 carucates\r\nof which were rateable to the tax called “gelt” (2_s._ to the carucate,\r\nor 120 acres).  Wispington is there said to be “in the soke” of Great\r\nStourton, and Kirkby-on-Bain, _i.e._, within the liberty, or under the\r\njurisdiction, of those parishes.  There was no resident proprietor at\r\nthat date, but 9 sokemen (or free tenants) and 6 bordars worked the land\r\nunder their “Mesne or Lord” the land being his “de-mense” or domain,\r\n_i.e._, Lordship.  The second mention of the parish in Domesday gives its\r\nwhole extent as 8 carucates (or 960 acres), divided between the\r\nabove-named Bishop and another of the Conqueror’s favourites, not seldom\r\nnamed in these records, viz., Eudo, son of Spirewic, Lord of Tattershall,\r\nwho claimed, over the Bishop, the lion’s share, namely, two thirds of the\r\nparish.\r\n\r\nHow long the Bishops of Durham continued in possession does not appear,\r\nbut in the “Lindsey Survey” (circa A.D., 1114) Ranulph, Bishop of that\r\nSee, had 9 carucates of land (or 1080 acres) in Wispington, Kirkby, and\r\ntwo other parishes; and, according to the old record, “Testa de Nevill”\r\n(p. 335), the Bishop of that day still held the same (circa 1214, A.D.);\r\nwhile in the 46th year of the reign of Edwd. III. (A.D. 1373), on the\r\ndeath of John Willoughby of Eresby, it is stated that he held all his\r\nmanors, among which Wispington is named, “of the Bishop of Durham, by the\r\nservice of being his steward, and carrying to the table the messes of\r\nmeat, on the day of his consecration, and on the feasts of Christmas and\r\nWhitsuntide,” so that, at that date, the Bishop would seem to have been\r\nstill the superior Lord of Wispington, as of the other connected Manors.\r\n(“Fragmenta Antiquitatis”; quoted “Linc. N. & Q.,” July 1896, p. 38).\r\n\r\nAfter this period the ownership is not quite clear.  But this we can\r\nstate.  We have seen that Eudo, son of Spirewic, owned two thirds of\r\nWispington, by gift from the Conqueror.  His son, Hugh Fitz Eudo,\r\ncommonly called Brito, founded Kirkstead Abbey, in 1137, A.D., and that\r\nreligious house, at a later period, became possessed of land in\r\nWispington, and the benefice thereof.  But meanwhile the ownership\r\nchanged more than once.  From the Lansdowne M.S. (207 e., f. 455) in the\r\nBritish Museum, we find that Walter Bek, {233} who had come from\r\nFlanders, late in the 12 century, married Agnes, daughter of Pinso, and\r\nbecame, through his wife, Lord of Spilsby, Eresby, Lusby, Wispington, and\r\nother parishes; so that Eudo, and his later representatives, seem to have\r\npassed from the scene, and the successors of his quondam companion in\r\narms, Pinso, to have taken their place.\r\n\r\nBy a Court Roll (9. Richard I., A.D., 1198), it appears that Philip, son\r\nof Robert, “put in a plea against Henry Bek, for a Knight’s fee,” _i.e._,\r\na certain portion of land “in Tattershall, Wispington, and Kirkby.”\r\n(“Architect S. Journ,” xxiv. pt. i. p. 39).\r\n\r\nWe further find, from “Testa de Nevill,” (p. 335, “Wapentake of\r\nHorncastle,”) that Simon de Driby, held, “of the Fee of Tattershall,”\r\n(circa A.D. 1215), lands in Kirkby, Waddingworth, Wispington, and other\r\nplaces under Robert of Tattershall; the Wispington portion, therefore,\r\nwas probably that formerly held by Eudo.\r\n\r\nWhen Walter Bek’s sons succeeded to his property, the eldest, Henry,\r\nreceived as his portion the manors of Spilsby, Scrivelsby, Wispington,\r\netc.  (Harleian MS., 3720, f. 23.)\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of the 14th century, another prominent family is found\r\nconnected with this parish.  Sir William Willoughby married Alice,\r\ndaughter of John Bek, Lord of Eresby; and a “Feet of Fines,” of date A.D.\r\n1304, (Lincoln, file 69, 31 Edwd. I.) shows that a law-suit arose between\r\nJohn Bek, plaintiff, and Robert Willoughby, defendant, as to the\r\npossession of lands in Wispington, Thimbleby, Langton, Woodhall, etc.,\r\nand the advowson of Wispington, which ended in a compromise, Robert\r\ngranting the lands and advowson to John, for his life-time, but to\r\nrevert, on his decease, to Robert and his heirs for ever.  (“Architect S.\r\nJournal,” xxiv. p. 52).  The manor and advowson of Wispington thus passed\r\nto the ancestors of the Lords of Willoughby.  In the next century, we\r\nfind these transferred to Kirkstead Abbey, as shown by the following\r\nentry, in the “Kalendar of Patent Rolls 1399–1401”:—“1401, April 20.\r\nLicence paid in the hanaper for Philip de Dispenser, Knight; James Roos,\r\nknight; Eudo de Zouche, clerk; Richard de Wynnewick, clerk; Richard de\r\nChesterfield, clerk; Henry Malbys, parson of the Church of Wylughby; and\r\nThomas Fitz William of Mablethorpe, to grant in mortmain a toft and 4\r\nbovates of land, in Wyspyngton, and the advowson of the Church of the\r\nsame town, not held in chief, to the Abbot, and Convent of Kirkstede, in\r\naid of their maintenance.” (p. 477). {234}\r\n\r\nThis was further confirmed, A.D. 1401, May 2, with the addition that the\r\n“Abbot and Convent of Kirkstede” might “serve the Benefice by a Chaplain,\r\nMonk, or Secular” (pp. 278, 279).\r\n\r\nWe are, after this period, unable to give (as has been done in the cases\r\nof some other parishes), a connected series of proprietors.  There are\r\nhowever, various scattered records of individual owners, which possess\r\nsome interest.  In a Bardney Abbey Charter, lately recovered by the Rev.\r\nJ. A. Penny, the present Vicar of Wispington, Thomas Sely of Wispington,\r\nand Henry son of Andrew, of the same place, are witnesses to a deed, of\r\ndate May 22, 1281, signed in the Chapter House of that Monastery, “on the\r\nSunday next after the Ascension of our Lord,” by which the Abbot of that\r\nHouse gives up for himself and his successors, all claim to his bondman,\r\nWilliam, son of Peter Hardigray, with all his goods and chattels, in\r\nfavour of Thomas Thorley of Gautby.  It is worthy of notice, that, by\r\nanother charter, this same Thomas Thorley, of Gautby, grants to the above\r\nWilliam Hardigray, no longer a bondman, but Rector of Mareham, certain\r\nlands and tenements in the adjoining parish of Edlington.  The two were,\r\ntherefore, evidently close friends.  This deed is witnessed by Henry, son\r\nof John, of Wispington, Simon Francis, of Edlington, William son of\r\nMaster Bartholomew, of Thimbleby, and others.\r\n\r\nBy a third charter, dated at Edlington, the day of Mercury (Wednesday)\r\nnext after the feast of St. Michael, A.D. 1285, William, son of William\r\nof Wispington, gives, grants, and confirms, to the same William\r\nHardigray, now of Edlington, clerk, a toft with the tenements thereon,\r\nsituated in Edlington, for which he is to pay annually the rent of one\r\nfarthing, at the feast of Easter. {235}\r\n\r\nAmong Gibbons’ “Early Lincolnshire Wills” (pp. 35, 36.) we find, that\r\nHenry de Brauncewell, Canon of Lincoln, by will in 1395, leaves money to\r\nhis poor parishioners, at Wispington, Leasingham, St. Peter’s at Arches,\r\nand elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe now get another name, which was one of weight in this parish and\r\nelsewhere for many years.  Among the list of noblemen and gentry, who\r\nsubscribed for the defence of the country, when the Spanish Armada was\r\nexpected, in 1589, we find the name of “Roberte Phillippes, of\r\nWispington,” who, like his neighbour Vincent Welby, of Halstead Hall,\r\ncontributed £25, which was a large sum in those days.  (“Linc. N. & Q.”\r\nvol. ii., p. 133).  In the next century, among the list of gentry of\r\nLincolnshire, made on the Herald’s Visitation, in 1634, along with the\r\nwell-known names of Heneage, Pelham, Massingberd, Monson, &c., we also\r\nfind Robert Phillips, of Wispington.  (“Linc. N. & Q.” vol. ii., p. 73).\r\n\r\nThis family, which afterwards by marriage acquired the name of Glover,\r\n{236} possessed property outside of Wispington, for we find from a bond\r\ndated October 25, 1735, that disputes having arisen as to the boundary of\r\nthe estate of Phillips Glover, at Walmsgate, and that of the estate of\r\nMatthew Lister, of Burwell Park, adjoining it, the two proprietors agreed\r\nto place 12 stones, in the presence of witnesses, to fix for the future\r\nthe line of separation between the properties.  (Notes on the Manor of\r\nBurwell, by R. W. Goulding; “Architect. S. Journal,” xxiv., pt. i., p.\r\n91.)  Other records in connection with this family, are as follows:—\r\n\r\n(1.)  Walter Harpham, by his will dated 10 Feb. 1607–8, leaves the\r\nreversion of £100 to Alice Phillips, his daughter, and £300 to his\r\ngranddaughter, Elizabeth Phillips, and to his grandson, Willoughby\r\nPhillips, £100, and makes his son-in-law, Thomas Phillips, executor.\r\n(Maddison’s “Wills of Lincolnshire,” 1600–1617, p. 180).\r\n\r\n(2.)  John Holland, of Hemingby, by will, of date 15 Sep., 1608, leaves\r\n20s. to Mr. Stephen Phillips, of Wispington, for supervising his will.\r\n(Maddison’s “Wills of Lincolnshire,” 1600–1617, p. 27.)\r\n\r\n(3.)  Margery Neale, of Horncastle, by her will, dated July 10, 1611,\r\nleaves to Jane Phillips, wife of Vincent Smithe, £6 in money, herself to\r\nkeep £3 of it, and to give £3 to her daughter Elizabeth, “my\r\nGoddaughter.”  (Ibidem, p. 51.)\r\n\r\nIn the Register of Admissions to Gray’s Inn, London (edited by J. Foster,\r\n1889), “Robert Phillips, of Wispington, Co., Lincoln,” is named as a\r\nstudent “admitted Feb. 7, 1653–4.”\r\n\r\nPhillips Glover, Esq., of Wispington, or Colonel Glover, married, circa.\r\n1790, being then resident at Stainfield, Rebecca, eldest daughter of Mr.\r\nWilliam Jepson Proctor, Chapter Clerk, &c., of the Bail, Lincoln, and\r\nsister to the Rev. George Jepson, M.A., Prebendary of Lincoln, 1781–1787.\r\n(“Linc. N. & Q.” vol. ii., p. 150).\r\n\r\nColonel Glover had a daughter, who married Robert Vyner, Esq., of\r\nEathorpe, Co. Warwick, and had a numerous family.  He, or more probably\r\nhis father, was Sheriff of the county of Lincoln, in the year 1727.\r\nEarly in the 19th century was issued a large mezzotint portrait of\r\nPhillips Glover, Esq., of Wispington, described “as a steady\r\ndisinterested friend, who never courted popularity, but was ever\r\ndeserving of it.”  (“Linc. N. & Q.” vol. ii., p. 87).  The Glovers, or\r\nPhillipses, were patrons of the Benefice; John Phillips, according to\r\n“Liber Regis,” presenting in 1707, and Mrs. Glover in 1755.  In 1769,\r\n“pro hac vice,” Henry Martinson, Gent., presented, having doubtless\r\nbought the next presentation, since we find his relative John Martinson,\r\ninstituted to the vicarage at that date.  On his death a Glover presented\r\nfor the last time, the entire property being subsequently sold to Mr.\r\nTurnor, of Stoke Rockford, Panton, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Glovers, and Phillipses, had a fine residence here, of which\r\nextensive traces still remain, in moats, fish ponds, and terraced mounds,\r\nsome 500 yards in length, and covering 5 or 6 acres.  The series of ponds\r\nand moats are arranged so as to curl about in a curious serpentine shape,\r\nforming the outline of a snake with double head.  This apparent survival\r\nof an old serpent worship, is not unusual in such ancient places as Abury\r\nHill, on Salisbury Plain; Stanton Drew, in Somersetshire; Carnac, in\r\nBrittany; &c.  (Dean’s “Worship of the Serpent,” 1833); but here it would\r\nseem to indicate a greater antiquity than the time of the Glover family.\r\nThe gardens, and “pleasaunce,” surrounding the residence, must have been\r\nvery extensive; the farmhouse, now occupied by Mr. Andrew Evison, was\r\npart of this residence, and there is some old brickwork among the farm\r\nbuildings, said to have been part of a private chapel. {237}  To the east\r\nwas an avenue of fine trees, of great age, which were felled in the first\r\nhalf of the 19th century.  The family continued at Wispington down to\r\nrecent times, though in greatly reduced circumstances, the last of them\r\nbeing the Rev. Robert Glover, vicar of the parish from 1795 to 1838.  He\r\ndied leaving a numerous family, scantily provided for. {238a}  During his\r\ntime the church and parsonage would seem to have participated in the\r\ndilapidated condition of his own fortune, and in the Register we find the\r\nfollowing note, in his own hand:—“The chancell of this church fell in, on\r\nFriday the 22 day of November, 1833, about 9 o’clock at night, R. Glover,\r\nvicar.”\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to the church.  Both Weir and Saunders state that the\r\nedifice, in their day, was without interest.  The late Rev. Charles Pratt\r\nTerrott, who was appointed to the vicarage, in 1838, by Mr. Christopher\r\nTurnor, took down this decayed structure, and erected an entirely new\r\nchurch; and, being well-known as an archæologist of wide learning, and\r\ncultivated tastes, {238b} with the aid of the architect, Mr. G. B.\r\nAtkinson, of York, he produced a church, which, though small, as the\r\npopulation only required, is one of unusual interest.  It was erected in\r\n1863.  In the process of demolition of the former church, two late Norman\r\ncapitals cut from one stone, {238c} were discovered, indicating that\r\nthere had, at one time, been a Norman edifice here; and, from other\r\nrelics, it was apparent that this early structure, had been either\r\nrebuilt or added to in the 13th century.  That building, however, had in\r\nturn been superseded by a wretched fabric of no architectural\r\npretensions, now, happily, gone the way of its more worthy predecessors.\r\nThe present church, dedicated like so many others in the neighbourhood to\r\nSt. Margaret, is of the Early English style, and consists of a tower with\r\nspire, nave, south porch, chancel, and vestry on the north side of the\r\nchancel, from which, for economy of space, access is had to the pulpit,\r\nstanding in the north-east corner of the nave.  The nave has coupled\r\nlancet windows in the north and south walls; there are detached lancet\r\nwindows, with a trefoiled light above them, in the west tower wall; and a\r\ntriplet at the east end of the chancel, and two single lights in its\r\nsouth wall.  The tower and spire are almost a copy of the small but\r\nelegant spire of Woodhall St. Margaret.  It is supported within by the\r\nrather unusual arrangement of a narthex or arcade of three arches, and\r\ntwo pillars, instead of the more common single arch.  The walls are\r\nrelieved by coloured patterns running round the windows, and various\r\ndevices elsewhere, which have a very pleasing effect.  The roof of the\r\nnave is supported by corbels bearing the symbols of the Evangelists.  The\r\npulpit is of Caen stone, with coloured marble shafts, the panels having\r\nsculptures, the work of Mr. Terrot, assisted by Mr. Watson Moore, of\r\nHorncastle; they represent the Nativity, Nathan and David, and the return\r\nof the Prodigal.  The font, of the same materials, is adorned with\r\nmedallions, also carved by the reverend artist, representing the animals\r\nmentioned in the New Testament, arranged in groups and intermingled with\r\nfoliage.  Mrs. Terrot’s artistic skill is also shown in the carving of\r\nthe figure of St. Margaret, placed above a dedication stone in the\r\nwestern wall of the nave, and in various bosses and capitals, as well as\r\nin the oaken eagle lectern.  The paving of the nave alley is of red and\r\nblack tiles; that of the chancel of Minton’s encaustic tiles, their\r\nrichness being increased within the altar rails.  The reredos is of the\r\nsame material, but differing in character.  The subjects in the coloured\r\neast window, by Messrs Ward and Hughes, are scenes from our Lord’s life\r\non earth; and in the western window, are the figures of St. Margaret, and\r\nSt. John the Baptist, by the same artists.  These were provided through\r\nthe efforts of Mrs. Terrot, who also obtained the 3rd bell to complete\r\nthe set.  The three bells bear the following inscriptions:—(1) “Ave Maria\r\nGraciæ Plena” (diameter 26¾ inches); (2) “Cast by John Warner and Sons,\r\nLondon” (diameter 28 inches); (3) “Sancta Maria Ora Pro Nobis” (diameter\r\n36¾ inches).  It is curious that the only bells in a minor key, in this\r\nneighbourhood, are those of Baumber and Wispington, contiguous parishes.\r\n\r\nBetween the font and the west window is a blue slate slab, having the\r\ninscription “Here lyeth the body of Robert Phillips, gentleman, who\r\ndeparted this life, the 24th day of June, 1668.”  On the south side of\r\nthis stone, close to it, lies the body of Phillips Glover, Esq.  On a\r\nwhite marble monument on the north wall of the chancel, are the arms and\r\ncrest, of the Phillips family; crest, a white eagle, with blue crown\r\nround its neck, on a hemlet, mantled, the visor closed; arms, azure,\r\nparty per chevron, argent, three white eagles with azure crowns round\r\ntheir necks passant, 1 and 2.  Below is the inscription:—“To the memory\r\nof John Phillips, Esq., this monument is dedicated by his nephew and\r\nheir, Phillips Glover, Esq.  He was the second and last surviving son of\r\nRobert Phillips, Esq., who lies buried in this chancel.  He died\r\nunmarried on the 19th of February, 1719–20, aged 62, and in him his\r\nfamily was extinct.  In memory of Phillips Glover, Esq: He married Mary\r\ndaughter and heiress of Richard Lee, Esq., of Winslade, in Devonshire,\r\nand left two children, Phillips and Mary.  He died, June 28, 1745.  Veri\r\ncultor et Libertatis.  This inscription by his order.”\r\n\r\nOpposite this monument is one of white marble, on the south side of the\r\nchancel, behind the desk.  The arms and crest are the same, with this\r\ninscription:—“Near this place lyeth ye bodye of Robert Phillips, Esq.,\r\nwho departed this life, ye 24th of June, 1668.  And of Stephen Phillips,\r\nEsq., eldest son of Robert, who departed this life, ye 9th of Feb.,\r\n1682–3.  And of Robert Phillips, of London, Goldsmith, third son of\r\nRobert Phillips, who departed this life, the 12 of December, 1707.  And\r\nof Benjamen Phillips, merchant, fourth son of ye above said Robert, who\r\ndeparted this life, Aug. ye 8th, 1715, æt 49.”\r\n\r\nOver the instruments of the Passion, in a medallion above the vestry\r\ndoor, in the chancel (which are really the masonic signs of a Knight\r\nTemplar’s encampment, {240}) is a tablet with this inscription:—“To the\r\nmemory of the Rev. Robert Merony Glover, who was upwards of 43 years\r\nvicar of this parish.  He died Feb. 8th, 1838, aged 62 years.  He was the\r\npoor man’s friend.  Also of Ann, relic of the above Robert Merony Glover,\r\nwhose remains are interred in the family vault of her parents, at\r\nHorncastle.  Four of their children rest in this chancel.  This tablet is\r\nconsecrated by the affectionate and grateful survivors.”\r\n\r\nIn the vestry, on a tablet on the north wall, is this\r\ninscription:—“Sacred to the memory of the Rev. John Martinson, late vicar\r\nof this church, and rector of Screamby, who departed this life, the 16th\r\nof July, 1788, aged 51 years.”  An incised slab, now in the floor of the\r\nvestry, but whence removed is not known, has an inscription to John\r\nHetherset, “Rector,” in 1399.  The figure is habited in full canonicals,\r\neven to the gloves.\r\n\r\nThe benefice is now only a “vicarage”; but the explanation of this\r\ndifference is, that, at that date, just before the advowson was given to\r\nKirkstead Abbey, it was a rectory.  When the rectorial tithes passed to\r\nthe abbot, the incumbent became the abbot’s vicar.\r\n\r\nIn the south-east corner of the churchyard, is a tombstone with the\r\ninscription:—“In memory of the 18 children of George and Mary Hannath,\r\nwho all died in their infancy, 1831–1855. {241}  He shall gather the\r\nlambs in His arms, and carry them in His bosom.”\r\n\r\nOne of the double lancet windows in the nave, nearest the pulpit has\r\nbeen, within recent years, filled with coloured glass in memory of the\r\nRev. C. P. Terrot, by his widow.  The subjects are four:—(1) Bezaleel\r\ncarving cherubim on the altar, and overlaying them with gold; (2)\r\nAholiab, the cunning workman, looking at his work; (3) our Lord as a\r\nyouth, working at his trade of carpenter; (4) a medieval priest,\r\npresenting before the altar, a small church, which is held in his hands.\r\nThe two small lancets in the south wall of the chancel have stained glass\r\nto the memory of Colonel Charles Terrot, eldest son of the Rev. C. P.\r\nTerrot.  The subjects are two:—(1) Samuel presented by Hannah in the\r\nTemple; (2) Joshua commanding the sun to stand still.  The small window\r\nover the font was presented by Miss Terrot, the subject being the Holy\r\nDove hovering.  Recently Mrs. Terrot presented to the church a casket,\r\ncontaining an account of the restoration, and contents, of the church,\r\nbeautifully bound.  This is kept on a bracket in the east wall of the\r\nnave, opposite the pulpit.\r\n\r\nWe give here a list of the vicars of this parish during the last two and\r\na half centuries.  William Azlack, 1662–1670; John Smith, 1670–1707;\r\nThomas Doughty, 1707–8–1754; J. Carr, 1754–1769; John Martinson,\r\n1769–1788; William Chaplin, 1788–1795; Robert Merony Glover, 1795–1838;\r\nC. P. Terrot, 1838–1886; Beauchamp St. John Tyrwhitt, 1886–1890; F. S.\r\nAlston, 1890–1896; James Alpass Penny, 1896.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned that the Glovers became very much reduced in pecuniary\r\nmeans; when the Rev. Robert Merony Glover, died in 1838, he left the\r\nchurch, vicarage, and farmstead adjoining, almost in ruins; and we think\r\nit should not go unrecorded, that the Rev. Charles Pratt Terrot, who\r\nsucceeded him, declined to accept any compensation for these\r\ndilapidations, as the Glover family were so poor.\r\n\r\nAn ancient font was placed in the church, June 2nd, 1841, having been\r\nremoved from the ruins of an oratory in the garden of Poolham Hall.  This\r\nis now the font in the church of Woodhall St. Margaret, being placed\r\nthere by the vicar, the present writer.  It is supported by 4 columns of\r\nserpentine, the gift of the Rev. J. A. Penny, of Wispington.\r\n\r\nThe register dates from 1662.  Some of the entries are peculiar.  From\r\n1662 to 1667, the entries of baptisms regularly alternate between\r\nchildren of William Azlack, clerk, and Mary, his wife, and those of\r\nRobert Phillips, Esq., and Mary, his wife; vicar and squire thus running\r\neach other “neck and neck” in their progeny, a competition which\r\ncuriously is terminated by the demise of the vicar’s wife, buried May\r\n10th, 1668, and that of Mr. Robert Phillips, six weeks later, who was\r\nburied June 26th, 1668.\r\n\r\nOn “Oct. 18th, 1682, Mr. Philip Ormston, rector of Skremby, was buried”\r\nhere.  Why he was brought to Wispington for burial does not appear,\r\nunless his Christian name indicates relationship to the Phillips family.\r\n\r\nOn Oct. 27th, 1692, is registered the marriage of “John Spennly, weaver,\r\nand Isabel Hawstead, spinster.”  The latter, doubtless derived her name\r\nfrom the neighbouring hamlet of Halstead, in Stixwould, still pronounced\r\n“Haw-stead.”  The addition of “weaver” to the husband’s name is\r\ninteresting, as evidence of a bygone craft.  Weaving and spinning were at\r\nthat time a common occupation of the humbler classes. {243}  The epithet\r\n“spinster” we still retain, of the woman to be married, but the term\r\n“weaver” for the man is now obsolete.  The Rev. J. A. Penny has part of a\r\nblanket, which was woven by the great grandmother of a parishioner in\r\nWispington, now 60 years of age.\r\n\r\nIn 1792, we find “Bartho (Bartholomew) Goe” signing as curate; a\r\npatronymic which, until recently, survived in the neighbourhood.  Among a\r\nlist of the Vicars of Boston, Bartholomew Goe is given as appointed in\r\n1817 (Thomson’s “Boston,” p. 86).  It may also be noticed that on “July\r\n16th, 1788, John Martinson, vicar, was buried”; the next entry recording\r\nthe burials of his posthumous son, John, aged 8 weeks, on March 17th,\r\n1789; while the next entry again records the burial of his relict, Mary\r\nMartinson, Sept. 21st, 1791.\r\n\r\nOn Nov. 2nd, 1710, “William Peascodd of this parish, and Amy Todd of ye\r\nparish of Bardney, were married”; in connection with which entry, we may\r\nmention, that there is in Boston Church, within the altar rails, on the\r\nnorth side, a fine brass of “Walter Peascod, merchant, 1398.”\r\n\r\nOpposite several of the names in the register, both in the 17th and 18th\r\ncenturies, are appended curious “hieroglyphic” signs, the meaning of\r\nwhich is, at the least, obscure.\r\n\r\nOf the communion plate, the cup and paten are dated 1712, presented by\r\nJohn Phillips, Esq.\r\n\r\nA group of trees in this parish is named “Barrow Plantation.”  Whether\r\nthere existed formerly a sepulchral barrow, which gave rise to the name,\r\nis not known; the explanation given by the modern bucolic mind is that\r\nthe spot is haunted by a spectral wheelbarrow.\r\n\r\nA tradition lingers here that, in the 18th century, a duel was fought,\r\naround which the usual accretions have clustered; that the combatants\r\nwere two brothers, who were attached to the same “ladye fayre”; that one\r\nkilled the other; that they fought in the avenue near the former hall of\r\nthe Glovers; while, in a pannelled bedroom at the adjoining hall farm,\r\nthere is still preserved a cupboard, which has not been opened for many\r\nyears, as it is supposed, in some way, to be connected with “the green\r\nlady” (such ladies are usually “green”), who was the cause of the\r\nquarrel.  Careful enquiry, however, has ruthlessly swept away all of the\r\naccumulated romance of this incident, and the bare facts are found to be\r\nas follows, for which, it should be added, the writer is indebted to a\r\nMS. in the possession of Captain Craggs, of Threekingham Hall, confirmed\r\nby the “Gentleman’s Magazine” of 1760, p. 246.:—Thursday, May 1st.  The\r\ncombatants were Major Glover, of Wispington, of the Lincolnshire Militia,\r\nand Mr. Jackson, an apothecary, of Manchester.  “At a rehearsal, at the\r\nplayhouse, in that town, Mr. Jackson came behind the Major, and struck\r\nhim on the back, seemingly in joke, upon which the Major turned about and\r\nwith a switch struck Jackson, saying, also in joke, ‘What!  Jackson, is\r\nit you?’  On this Jackson, in a great passion, said ‘D—n you, sir,\r\nalthough you are a Major, I will not take this from you.’  The Major,\r\nsurprised at this, replied, ‘Why, what can you mean?  I was only in joke,\r\nas well as yourself.’  But Jackson persisted in his anger, and said he\r\ninsisted on satisfaction.  The Major was not able to pacify him by saying\r\nthat he meant no affront.  But Jackson insisted on fighting him with\r\nswords.  They went to a coffee-house, and there, in a back room, they\r\nfought.  The Major ran Mr. Jackson through the body, after which, on the\r\nformer leading Mr. Jackson through the coffee-room for assistance, Mr.\r\nJackson, owned, before several witnesses, that it was entirely his own\r\nfault, and that he had been wounded by the Major in a very fair and\r\ngentlemanlike manner; and that, if he died, he entirely forgave the\r\nMajor.”\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Mr. Jackson would seem to have incurred the fatal penalty\r\nof his own folly; for, in the same magazine, under the date “Wednesday,\r\nAug. 20th, 1760,” p. 440, is the following notice:—“At the Assizes at\r\nLancaster, Philip Glover, Esq., Major in the Lincolnshire Militia, was\r\nfound guilty of manslaughter, for killing Mr. Jackson, of Manchester, in\r\na duel, and was immediately discharged out of custody in court.  It was\r\nwith great difficulty that sufficient evidence could be procured to\r\ninduce the grand jury to find the bill.”\r\n\r\nThus the one passage of arms, of which we know, connected with\r\nWispington, although fatal in its effect, is reduced to the farce of\r\nhuman folly.  From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step.\r\n\r\nMay Wispington’s future martial sons fight in a nobler cause than that of\r\nself pride.\r\n\r\nWe may add, that at a court-martial held eight months later, March 24th,\r\n1762, Philip Glover was acquitted of any “behaviour contrary to the\r\narticles of war,” but the court was of opinion that he had, in hasty\r\nheat, used language to Capt. Gardiner, contrary to good order and\r\ndiscipline, and he was adjudged to be reprimanded publicly in the\r\npresence of the officers and men of his regiment.  The member of this\r\ncourt-martial were the following:—Col. Lord Vincent Mandeville, Hunts.\r\nMilitia, president; Lieut.-Col. Richard Townley, Lancashire Militia;\r\nLieut.-Col. John Lister, Yorkshire Militia; Major Robert Coney, Norfolk\r\nMilitia; Major Sir Philip Monoux, Bart., Bedfordshire Militia; Major\r\nFrancis Longe, Norfolk Militia; Capt. Edmund Townley, Lancashire Militia;\r\nCapt. Carr Brackenbury, Lincolnshire Militia; Capt. G. De Ligne Gregory,\r\nLincolnshire Militia, and others; with the Honble. Charles Gould, Deputy\r\nJudge Advocate General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\n\r\nABERGAVENNY, Earls of, 59\r\nAbrincis, Lupus de, 65, 75, 144, 170, 225\r\nAcham, Anthony, charity

The ash tree was supposed to have peculiar virtues: weakly children\r\nwere passed through it three times, before sunrise, to give them\r\nstrength; and to the Rowan, or mountain-ash many superstitions are\r\nattached.  (“Folklore,” vol. ii., No. 1, p. 88, et alibi.)\r\n\r\n{2b}  It would appear, however, that water was a more marked feature of\r\nthe locality 100 years ago.  Sir Joseph Banks, writing of the antiquities\r\nof Ashby, in an article contributed to “Archæologia” at that time (vol.\r\nxii., p. 96), mentions the “sloping hills with brisk rills of water\r\nrunning through almost every valley.”  It should not be forgotten that\r\nformerly a tract of forest extended all along this district, so that (as\r\nI have mentioned elsewhere) a Dutch sportsman spent a whole season in\r\nhunting “in Lincolniensi montium tractu,” among the Lincolnshire hills.\r\nWhen that forest was cleared away, as a natural consequence the streams\r\nwould shrink in volume, or disappear altogether.\r\n\r\n{4}  The Elands were landowners in Stourton, East Kirkby, and other\r\nplaces.  One of them resided at East Kirkby as late as 1870.  Sir William\r\nEland was Constable of Nottingham Castle, 1330, and M.P. for the county\r\nin 1333 (Bailey’s “Annals,” vol. i., p. 223).  The Gedneys were\r\nconsiderable owners in the neighbourhood.  In the church at Bag Enderby\r\nthere is a handsome stone mural monument of Andrew and Dorothy Gedney,\r\nwith their two sons and two daughters kneeling before prayer desks.  This\r\nAndrew Gedney married Dorothy, daughter of Sir William Skipwith, of South\r\nOrmesby, by his wife, Alice Dymoke.\r\n\r\n{5}  John de Kirketon (or Kirton), near Boston, received the honour of\r\nknighthood from Ed. II., owned Tattershall and Tumby, and was summoned to\r\nParliament 16 Ed. III.  They had large property in Boston in 1867\r\n(Thompson’s “History of Boston,” p. 226).\r\n\r\n{6a}  The pedigree of the Littleburys is given in the Herald’s\r\n“Visitation of Lincolnshire” 1562–4; edited by W. Metcalf, F. S. A. (Bell\r\nand Sons, 1881).\r\n\r\n{6b}  Sir Thomas Meeres was knighted 11 June, 1660.  He was almost\r\ncontinuously M.P. for Lincoln from 1660 to his death in 1708.\r\n(“Architect. Soc. Journal,” 1891, p. 13.)\r\n\r\n{7}  The late Poet Laureate, in his poem “Walking to the Mail” (Poems,\r\n1842), tells of a farmer who was so pestered by the presence of this\r\nghost about his house, that he harnessed his horse to his cart and\r\nstarted to leave home to get rid of it:—\r\n\r\n    “The farmer, vext, packs up his bed,\r\n    And all the household stuff, and chairs,\r\n    And with his boy betwixt his knees, his wife\r\n    Upon the tilt—sets out and meets a friend,\r\n    Who hails him, ‘What! Art flitting?’\r\n    ‘Yes, we’re flitting,’ says the ghost,\r\n    For they had packed her among the beds.\r\n    ‘Oh! Well!’ the farmer says, ‘You’re flitting with us too!\r\n    ‘Jack, turn the horse’s head, and home again.’”\r\n\r\nThere are sundry other ghosts, or witches, remembered in the\r\nneighbourhood, which may be heard of by the curious.\r\n\r\n{9}  Among the lists of institutions to benefices, preserved in the\r\nArchives at Lincoln, is that of “Thomas Hardie, clerk, presented by the\r\nDean and Chapter, Vicar, A.D. 1567.”  This was in the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth; the patronage, therefore, was probably granted to that body by\r\nher father, Henry VIII., on the dissolution of the Tattershall College.\r\n(“Institutions, 1540–1570,” edited by Rev. C. W. Foster.)\r\n\r\n{10}  The writer has reason to remember the hollowness of the beck, for\r\non one occasion, when riding with the foxhounds, there being a steep\r\ndescent to the beck, and the beck itself having rotten, hollow banks, the\r\nsoil gave way beneath his horse’s hind legs, and, although they landed on\r\nthe other side, the horse was all in a heap, and the rider shot over its\r\nhead.  They, however, recovered themselves, and no other riders\r\nattempting it they gained a considerable advantage over the rest of the\r\nfield.  When shooting along its banks he has seen places where the\r\nhollowness was still more marked, the beck itself being barely more than\r\ntwo feet wide, and four feet, or even more, deep.\r\n\r\n{12a}  “The culverhouse, or dovecote, attached to old baronial and other\r\nhouses, was a valuable source of food supply in days when the fattening\r\nof cattle was not understood.”  (“Nature and Woodcraft,” by J. Watson.)\r\n\r\n{12b}  The existence of this watermill is not without interest.  They\r\nwere a source of considerable revenue, and this probably belonged to the\r\nmonks of Tattershall College, and all their tenants would be expected to\r\nhave their grain ground at it.  In an ancient MS., of Spalding Priory, it\r\nis recorded that certain tenants of the Prior were heavily fined because\r\nthey took their corn to be ground elsewhere.\r\n\r\n{12c}  At a monastery at Norwich 1,500 quarters of malt were used\r\nannually for ale.  Ingulphus, the abbot of Croyland, laments in his\r\nHistory, the damage caused by a fire at the Abbey, inasmuch as it\r\n“destroyed the cellar and casks full of ale therein” (quoted Oliver’s\r\n“Religious Houses,” p. 15, note 5).\r\n\r\n{13}  The full inscription is:—“Here lyeth Rychard Lyttleburye, of\r\nStanesbye in ye countie of Lincoln Esquier and Elizabeth his wyffe\r\ndaughter of Sir Edmund Jenney of Knotsolt in the countie of Suff. Knight,\r\nwhich Richard departed this lyfe in the xiii year of the Reign of King\r\nHenry ye eight Ao. D’ni. 1521 and Elizabeth dyed in ye xv yeare of ye\r\nRaigne of ye sayd King H. Ao. 1523.”\r\n\r\n{15a}  See Notices on Baumber, Bolingbroke, Hareby, East Kirkby, etc.\r\n\r\n{15b}  See the Notices of Baumber and Stourton.\r\n\r\n{16}  They had also large possessions in the counties of York and Durham.\r\n\r\n{19}  The descendants of Ivo Tailbois seem to have lost the commanding\r\nposition of their ancestor; since in a Close roll of Henry VII., No 30.,\r\nit is stated that Sir Robert Dymmok, and others, “being seized of the\r\nManors of Sotby and Baumburg, granted an annuity therefrom of £20 to\r\nWilliam Tailboys, who now assigns the deed, granting that annuity to him,\r\nto Bartholomew Rede, citizen, and goldsmith, of London, for a debt,”\r\n(evidently a London money-lender), Dated May 9th, Henry VII., A.D. 1494.\r\n\r\n{20}  This Mr. Thomas Livesey married Lydia, widow of Matthew Dymoke\r\nLister, Esq., of Burwell Park, and was buried at Burwell, 1790, March\r\n28th.  (‘Notices of the Listers’, “Architect Journal,” 1897, pp. 92, 3).\r\n\r\n{26a}  According to _Magna Britannia_, it had an annual fair as well as a\r\nweekly market, on Tuesdays; although Leland (Itiner. Cur., vol. vii. 52),\r\nsays “It hath once a year a fair, but hath no weekly market.”  But surely\r\nthe larger mart could imply the smaller, and Weir in his History of\r\nLincolnshire (vol. ii. p. 407), mentions an attempt at New Bolingbroke,\r\nto “revive the market on Tuesday,” showing that there was one of old.\r\n\r\n{26b}  To show the extent of the soke, we find from “Inquisition post\r\nmort. 41, Ed. III., No. 47,” that in 1367 it was decided that Ralph de\r\nNevill holds “a fee in Ulceby, as of this Manor.”  Yet Ulceby is distant\r\nseveral miles.\r\n\r\n{27}  The Tenor bell was also re-hung at her expense.\r\n\r\n{28}  The present writer had the charge of that excursion, and twice\r\nvisited the church in company of the Precentor, to examine its details,\r\nwhich he has done again at a more recent date.\r\n\r\n{29}  That there was a chantry here is proved by the fact, that at the\r\nLincolnshire Rising in 1536, the Bishop’s Chancellor Dr. Rayner, was\r\nseized while being ill in bed at the house of the Chantry Priest, and\r\nafterwards murdered.

(1848, p. 188).\r\n\r\n{30b}  She was given in marriage by William the Conqueror to his nephew,\r\nIvo Taille-bois, Earl of Anjou; but he dying early to her great relief,\r\nshe married secondly Roger de Romara, son of Gerald, who had been\r\nSeneschall or High Steward to William as Duke of Normandy, before the\r\nconquest of England.  For third husband she married Ranulph, Earl of\r\nChester.\r\n\r\n{30c}  A tradition still lingers in the parish of Bucknall, that the\r\nplace was in some way connected with the Lady Godiva; and here we get the\r\nconnection.  Her brother, and therefore doubtless her father, was Lord of\r\nthe Demesne of Bucknall.  The Lord (Saxon “Laford”) and Lady (Saxon\r\n“Lafdig”) were esteemed for the loaf (Saxon “Laf”) dealt out to the\r\nhungry dependants, and their memory still lingers like a sweet savour\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\n{31a}  The Lady Lucia conveyed, and the conveyance was confirmed by King\r\nJohn, the church and benefice of Bolingbroke to the Priory of Spalding\r\n(Dugdale Monasticon ii., 381); and, according to Liber Regis, it paid to\r\nthe Priory a pension of £3 6s. 8d.\r\n\r\n{31b}  The Thorolds were also men of position in Normandy.  The name is\r\non the ancient Bayeux tapestry; and it also still survives in the old\r\nfamily residence, the Hotel de Bourgthorould, in Rouen.\r\n\r\n{32}  The Head Office of the Duchy is now in London at Lancaster-place,\r\nStrand; but two courts are held at Bolingbroke in May and October for all\r\ncopyhold accounts.\r\n\r\n{34a}  There was formerly at Edlington an old Jacobean Hall, on the site\r\nof the later Hall.  The entire fittings of the dining room of this\r\nstructure, some 23ft. in length, still survive in the dining room of\r\nRollestone House, Horncastle, the residence of R. Jalland, Esq.\r\n\r\n{34b}  Mrs. Heald was the daughter of George Heald, Esq., Barrister, of\r\nthe Chancery Court, commonly known, as “Chancellor Heald,” to whom, with\r\nhis wife, and daughter Emma, there is a marble monument, on the north\r\nwall of the Chancel, in St. Mary’s Church, Horncastle.  He died, March\r\nl8th, 1834.  The Chancellor also at one time resided at Edlington Hall.\r\n\r\n{37a}  This Sir Walter Tailboys was the son of Henry Tailboys, and his\r\nwife Ahanora, who was daughter and heir of Gilbert Burdon, and his wife\r\nElizabeth, the latter being sister and heir of Gilbert Umfraville, Earl\r\nof Angus.\r\n\r\n{37b}  Sir John Bolles, of Thorpe Hall, is the hero of the tradition of\r\n“the Green Lady,” of that place.  She nursed him while imprisoned in\r\nSpain, and fell in love with him.  He was obliged to explain to her that\r\nhe had a wife at home already, whereupon she made valuable presents of\r\njewellery to him for his wife.  She was said to haunt Thorpe Hall, and\r\nfor some time a plate was always laid, and a vacant place kept for her at\r\nthe table.  Some of this jewellery still exists, and is worn, to my\r\nknowledge, by connections of the family (see Percy’s Ballads, vol. I.,\r\n“The Spanish Lady’s Love”).\r\n\r\n{41}  In the “Placito de quo Warranto,” p. 409, these gallows are\r\ndistinctly referred to as “furcœ in Edlington,” and the same document\r\nsays “Abbs de Bardeney venit hic,” etc., “the Abbot of Bardney comes\r\nhere,” doubtless to see for himself that the punishment is duly\r\ninflicted.\r\n\r\n{47a}  Lady of the Lake, Canto IV. 12, the Ballad of Alice Brand.\r\n\r\n{47b}  Mavis is the thrush, and Merle the blackbird.\r\n\r\n{47c}  Domesday Book, translated by Charles Gowan Smith, dedicated to\r\nEarl Brownlow, Earl Yarborough, and H. Chaplin, Esq., M.P. (Simpkin,\r\nMarshall and Co.)\r\n\r\n{49}  The Billesbies were a good family.  Sir Andrew Billesby was\r\ninvolved in the rebellion of 1536.  He was steward of Louth Park Abbey\r\nand Bullington Priory.\r\n\r\n{54}  This Bishop was, at the date of Domesday, William de Karilepho.  He\r\nhad been Abbot of St. Vincent; was consecrated Bishop of Durham, January\r\n3rd, 1082, and held the office of Chief Justice of England under the\r\nConqueror.  He was an ambitious man, and acquired great possessions,\r\nlargely in this neighbourhood.  He was banished from his See for three\r\nyears by William Rufus for conspiring, with many of the nobility, against\r\nthe throne.  And for the part which he took in the quarrel between Rufus\r\nand Archbishop Anselm, he was so severely rebuked that he died of wounded\r\npride.\r\n\r\n{58}  We have, in the north of the county, Goxhill which, in Domesday\r\nBook, is Golse; and in Broughton, not far from thence, is the hamlet\r\nGokewell; both of which may contain the same prefix.  Although Goltho,\r\nwhich has a similar sound, is a corruption of Caldicot.\r\n\r\n{59}  It is not improbable that these early possessions in Goulceby, &c.,\r\nmay have come to the Cromwells indirectly on the females’ side, through\r\ntheir connections, the Willoughbys; since we find, by a Feet of Fines\r\n(Lincoln, folio 69, A.D. 1302), that as early as the reign of Edward I.,\r\na suit was instituted between John Bec (of the ancient Spilsby and Lusby\r\nfamily), and Robert Wylgheby; wherein it was proved that the Willoughbys\r\neven then held lands in “Golkeby, Donington,” etc.\r\n\r\n{60a}  Feet of Fines, Lincoln, Trinity, 22 Elizabeth (“Architect. S.\r\nJourn.” 1895, p. 129.)\r\n\r\n{60b}  I have referred to this Thomas Glemham, in notices of\r\nMareham-le-Fen, of which manor he was Lord.  Other members of the family\r\nsettled elsewhere in the neighbourhood, besides Burwell, the\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\n{60c}  British Museum, Add., 5524., fol. 68.\r\n\r\n{60d}  He was eventually imprisoned by Cromwell, and died in exile in\r\nHolland.\r\n\r\n{61}  It is also stated that Mrs. Eleanor Lister “was buryed in ye vault,\r\nDec. ye 28th, in woollen”; and their first-born grandson Matthew,\r\nbaptized 7 May, 1703, was “buried in woollen” on the 13th of the same\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n{69}  Of course it is possible that the supposed owner of Greetham may\r\nhave been this second Lord Strafford, whose Ancestors held Ashby\r\nPuerorum.  I quote this from a paper in the “Architectural Society’s\r\nJournal” of 1891, by Rev. A. R. Maddison, F.S.A., entitled “A Ramble\r\nthrough the parish of St. Mary Magdalene,” in which he mentions house\r\nproperty in Lincoln belonging to the Wentworths.  It certainly shows a\r\nconnection of the Wentworths with Ashby Puerorum, then probably still an\r\nappurtenance of the Greetham Manor.\r\n\r\n{73}  The close connection of Haugh and Hagi, is shown by Domesday Book,\r\nwhich called the Lincolnshire village Haugh Hage.  Taylor (“Words and\r\nPlaces”) connected the word with “hedge” and our modern “haw-haw,” a sunk\r\nfence; and so a hedged enclosure.\r\n\r\n{75}  The present holders of this title (the Keppels), are a different\r\nfamily, their honour dating only from 1696.  Albemarle or Awmarle, a town\r\nin North Normandy, is now Aumale, from which the Duc d’Aumale takes his\r\ntitle.\r\n\r\n{76}  The Blunts (or Blounts) were an old Norman Family, who came over at\r\nthe Conquest.  The name is in the Rolls of Battle Abbey.  Walter Blunt\r\nwas created Baron de Mountjoy by Ed. IV.  The fine church of Sleaford was\r\nbuilt by Roger Blunt, in 1271, as appears from an old MS. found in the\r\nparish chest (“Saunder’s Hist.,” vol. ii. p. 252).  Camden (“Britannia,”\r\np. 517), says that they had a “a fine house” in his day (circa 1600), at\r\nKidderminster, and he mentions Sir Charles Blunt, Knight, as having a\r\nfine seat at Kimlet in Salop, where their “name is very famous” (p. 542).\r\nThe late Sir Charles Blunt used to visit Harrington in this\r\nneighbourhood, where the writer has met him, in days gone by, and enjoyed\r\nsport with his beagles.\r\n\r\n{78}  Richard Gedney, in his will dated 1 April, 1613, speaks highly of\r\nThomas Cheales of Hagworthingham, “Yeoman, whom he makes his trustee.”  A\r\njunior branch of the Cheales family now reside at Friskney.  The Rev.\r\nAlan Cheales still owns land here, now residing at Reading.  He is the\r\n11th in descent from Anthonie, who bought the property in 1590.\r\n\r\n{82}  These are no longer to be found, but they were mentioned in a MS.\r\nbelonging to Sir Joseph Banks, dated 1784.  Another brief was for “ye\r\nfirst Fast day for ye Plague, 1665, the sum of 15s 6a” (August 2nd)\r\n“September ye 6th, ye 2nd Fast day for ye Plague 1665 . . . 13_s_ 7_d_\r\nand 2_s_ more was added afterwards.”  Six Fast days were mentioned, when\r\nmoney was collected “for ye Plague.”  Among items, in the Church\r\naccounts, were:—“A sheet borne over the sacrament,” a “Kyrchuffe that our\r\nLady’s coat was lapped in,” “to Peter Babbe for gilding the Trinity,\r\niiiili xvis 0d.”  “It for painting the Dancing geere,” (_i.e._ at the\r\nMay-pole).  “It for viii. pound of waxe for Sepulchre lights iiiis\r\niiiid.”  “It for ii. antiphoonies bought at Stirbridge faire (&c.) iiili\r\nxis 7d”; “It for thacking the steeple xs”; “To William Edwards for\r\nfinding our Lady’s light viiiis iiiid”; “iiili xs given to finde yearly\r\nan obitt for the soul of Lawrence Clerke, . . . to say Dirige and Masse,\r\n. . . and for the bede roule,” &c.  There are charges, for “vi gallons\r\nyearly of aile” for the ringers.  The “Church corne, given of the good\r\nwill of the inhabitants to the value of xxs viiid.”  “Wessell (Wassail)\r\nfor the young men.”  “The town bull sold for iis viiid a quarter.” &c.,\r\n&c.  (“Lincs. N & Q.” vol. i. pp. 5–13).\r\n\r\n{83}  There are mounds, and traces of a moat in a field in Langton,\r\nshowing that there was formerly a large residence, probably the home of\r\nthis branch of the Angevin family, who came over with the Conqueror.\r\n\r\n{84a}  Gair means a triangular piece of land which requires ploughing a\r\ndifferent way from the rest of the field.  There was a Thomas Baudewin\r\nhad lands in Coningsby in the reign of Henry III. 106. Coram Rege Roll,\r\n42, Henry III.  “Linc. N. & Q.” iv. p. 102.\r\n\r\n{84b}  A pulse diet, for man or beast, seems to have been very general.\r\nPesedale-gate, means the gate, or road by the Pease-valley.  We have\r\nPesewang, _i.e._ Peasefield, in High Toynton, Pesegote-lane in Spilsby,\r\nand there are similar names at Louth, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n{87}  Streatfeild (“Lincolnshire and the Danes,” p. 219) says “from the\r\nold Norse ‘heri,’ or hare, come Eresby (or Heresby) and Hareby.”  In\r\nsouth Lincolnshire, hares are still called “heres.”  The canting crest of\r\nthe Withers’s family, is a hare’s head, with ears up-pricked.  Whether\r\nthere is any connection between “ear” and “eres” or hares, I know not,\r\nbut the long ears are a distinguishing feature, and often the only part\r\nof the animal visible in tall covers; and there is the same variation, in\r\nthe presence, or absence, of the aspirate, between the noun “ear” and the\r\nverb “to hear,” as between Eresby and Hareby.  The writer has a vivid\r\nrecollection of the hares as a feature of the locality, as he has\r\nfrequently joined coursing parties at Hareby, many years ago, when there\r\nwas game enough to afford sport for 30 couple of greyhounds.  Fuller in\r\nhis “Worthies of England,” p. 150 (Circa 1659), tells of a Dutchman who\r\ncame over and spent a season in hunting “in Lincolniensi montium tractu,”\r\nin the mountainous parts of Lincolnshire; and as foxhounds were not\r\nestablished at that date, this must have been hare hunting in these\r\nWolds.\r\n\r\n{88}  These accounts are worked out carefully, by Weir, in his History,\r\nbut the various steps are very complicated and some authorities differ\r\nfrom him in minor details.  By an Inquisition, 37 Henry III., it was\r\nshewn that in 1253, William de Bavent owned the Castle and manors\r\nattached to it.\r\n\r\n{90a}  See “History of the Ayscoughs,” by J. Conway Walter, published by\r\nMr. W. K. Morton, Horncastle.\r\n\r\n{90b}  Of this Blagge the following anecdote is preserved.  He was a\r\nfavourite with Henry VIII., who called him familiarly his “little pig.”\r\nA retrograde religious movement occurring towards the end of this reign,\r\nBlagge, with others, was imprisoned as an offender against the law of the\r\nSix Articles (1539) against Popish practices.  By Henry’s interposition\r\nhe was released and restored to his office.  On his first re-appearance\r\nat Court, the King said to him:—“So you have got back again my little\r\npig,” to which Blagge replied, “Yes, and but for your Majesty’s clemency,\r\nI should have been _roast_ pig before now.”\r\n\r\n{90c}  The Cuppledykes were large owners of property in this\r\nneighbourhood, several of their monuments still remaining in Harrington\r\nChurch and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n{91}  The pedigree of the Littleburies is given in the “Visitation of\r\nLincolnshire,” A.D. 1562–1564, edited by Mr. W. Metcalf, F.S.A., A. Bell\r\n& Sons, 1881.  Sir Humphrey Littlebury was descended from Hamon\r\nLittlebury, of Littlebury Manor, Essex, A.D. 1138.  Sir Martin Littlebury\r\nKnight was Chief Justice of England, 28 Henry III., A.D. 1243.  Fuller\r\nparticulars of this family are given in other of these Records.\r\n\r\n{93}  This record is interesting as giving an instance of the title “Sir”\r\nas applied to the Clergy.  A graduate of the University, having the M.A.\r\ndegree was styled “Master” so and so, but when in Holy Orders, if he was\r\nonly a B.A. he was styled “dominus,” the English equivalent of which was\r\n“Sir.”  This was a general style of address, and was continued in the\r\nIsle of Man to a late period.\r\n\r\nIn “A Short Treatise on the Isle of Man,” by James Chaloner, governor,\r\ndate 1656, it is stated that all the clergy who are natives have this\r\ntitle, even in one case a curate being so styled.  In Bale’s “Image of\r\nbothe Churches” (circa 1550), it is said, “the most ragged runagate among\r\nthem is no less than a Sir, which is a Lord in the Latin.”  In Pulleyn’s\r\n“Etymological Compendium,” we find “The title of ‘Sir’ was given to all\r\nwho had taken a degree, or had entered into Orders.”  Thus, Hearne, the\r\nAntiquary, after he had taken the degree of B.A., was addressed as “Sir\r\nHearne” (Aubrey’s Letters, i. 117), and William Waynfleet (afterwards\r\nBishop of Winchester), when he had taken the same degree, was called “Sir\r\nWaynfleet,” (“Chandler’s Life,” p. 54), Chaucer in his “Canterbury\r\nTales,” speaks of “Sir Clerk,” “Sir Monk,” and it even appeared in Acts\r\nof Parliament, as 12 and 13 Ed. IV., N. 14, “Sir James Theckness,\r\nPreste,” and i. Henry VII., p. 11, “Sir Oliver Langton, Preste?  Sir\r\nRobert Nayelsthorp, Preste.”\r\n\r\n{95}  In a ploughed field, about 300 yards from the main road, a large\r\nboulder was discovered by a ploughman, in 1902, measuring about 3ft. in\r\nlength, some 2½ft. in height, and about the same in thickness, being also\r\nice-borne Neocomian.\r\n\r\n{98a}  The learned Dr. Oliver (“Religious Houses,” Appendix, p. 167, note\r\n40) says, “wherever the word ‘Kir,’ or any of its derivatives, is found,\r\nit implies a former Druid temple.”  This syllable forms the base of the\r\nLatin “Circulus,” and our own “Circle.”  We find many interesting British\r\nnames containing it; for instance, in the name of that favourite resort\r\nof tourists in North Wales, Capel Curig, we have the plural Kerig,\r\nimplying the British (or Druid) sacred circle of stones, while we have\r\nalso, prefixed, the translation of it by the Roman Conquerors of those\r\nBritons, “Capella,” or Chapel.  As a parallel to this, we may mention,\r\nthat in Wiltshire on “Temple” Downs, there are some stone Druidical\r\nremains, which are locally known by the name of “Old Chapel” (Oliver,\r\nIbid., p. 175, note 66).  Again in Kerig y Druidion, another place in\r\nNorth Wales, we have the sacred circle “Kerig,” directly connected with\r\nthe Druids, in the suffix Druidion.  There is also at Kirkby Green, near\r\nSleaford, a spot called “Chapel Hill,” another at the neighbouring\r\nvillage Dorrington (“Darun” the Druid sacred oak), and also south of\r\nConingsby, on the sacred Witham, all probably sites of Druid worship.\r\n\r\n{98b}  Mr. Taylor (“Words and Places” p. 130) says, “the names of our\r\nrivers are Celtic (_i.e._ British).”  There is a river Ben, in Co. Mayo;\r\nBandon, Co. Cork; Bann, Co. Wexford; Bana, Co. Down; Bannon (Ban-avon),\r\nin Pembrokeshire; Banney, in Yorkshire; and Bain, in Hertfordshire.\r\n\r\n{99a}  The exact meaning of “by” is seen in the German, which is akin.\r\nIn Luther’s translation of Job. xxvi. 5, for “they dwell,” the old German\r\nis “die bey”; the latter word being our word “bide,” or “abide.”  A “by”\r\nwas an “abode,” or permanent residence; so the Lincolnshire farmer calls\r\nthe foundation of his stack, the “steddle,” connected with the Saxon,\r\n“steady,” and “stead” in “homestead,” &c.\r\n\r\n{99b}  Government Geological Survey, pp. 154–5.\r\n\r\n{100a}  Portions of Waddingworth and Wispington are given in Domesday\r\nBook, as being in the soke of Great Stourton, and Kirkby-on-Bain.\r\nStourton Magna, was formerly a place of some importance, sites being\r\nstill known as the positions of the market place, &c.\r\n\r\n{100b}  The names of Fulbeck, and Fulstow, are given in Domesday Book, as\r\nFugel-beck, and Fugel-stow.\r\n\r\n{101a}  Charter copied from “Dugdale” v., 456.  Date 1199.\r\n\r\n{101b}  In a cartulary of Kirkstead Abbey, of the early part of the 12th\r\ncentury, now in the British Museum (“Vespasian” E. xviii.), there is an\r\nagreement between the Abbot of Kirkstead, and Robert de Driby, “Lord of\r\nTumby,” that the Abbots’ “mastiffs” should be allowed in “the warren,” of\r\nTumby, at all times of the year, with the shepherds, on condition that\r\nthey do not take greyhounds; and if the mastiffs do damage to the game,\r\nthey shall be removed, and other dogs taken in their stead.  (“Architect\r\nS. Journal” xxiii. p. 109).\r\n\r\n{102a}  In the Cathedral of this City is still preserved the famous\r\nBaieux tapestry, said to be the work of Matilda, the Conqueror’s wife, in\r\nwhich are represented the exploits of her husband, in the Conquest of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n{102b}  He remained a prisoner during the reign of the Conqueror.  On the\r\naccession of William Rufus, he was set at liberty, and restored to\r\nfavour; but, after a time, heading a conspiracy against the King, in\r\nsupport of Robert, Duke of Normandy, and being defeated, he once more\r\nretired to that country, where Duke Robert rewarded him by making him\r\nGovernor of the province.\r\n\r\n{104a}  Among the other parishes, Cockerington, Owmby, Withcall, Hainton,\r\nNorth Thoresby, Friesthorpe, Normanby, Ingham, Sixhills, &c., in all\r\nseventeen.\r\n\r\n{104b}  The historian Camden (“Britannia,” fol. 711, 712), gives a\r\ncurious origin of the name Pontefract, which means “Broken Bridge.”  He\r\nsays that William Archbishop of York, returning from Rome, was here met\r\nby such crowds, to crave his blessing, that the bridge over the river\r\nAire broke beneath their weight, and great numbers fell into the river.\r\nThe prayers of the saint preserved them from being drowned, and hence the\r\nname was given to the place.  This however, occurred A.D. 1154, and, as\r\ndocuments exist of an earlier date, in which the name is found, as\r\nalready in use, the legend would seem to be a fabrication.  It is\r\nprobable, says another historian, that Hildebert gave the name to the\r\nplace, from its resemblance to some place in his own country where he was\r\nborn; the name being of Latin or Norman origin.\r\n\r\n{104c}  These connections, with authorities, are given fully in an\r\narticle on the “Descent of the Earldom of Lincoln,” in “Proceedings of\r\nthe Archæological Institute” for 1848, Lincoln volume pp. 252–278.\r\n\r\n{106}  As an illustration of the fickleness and superstition of the\r\ntimes, although he was condemned as a traitor by Edward II., he was\r\nregarded as a martyr in the cause of liberty by the people, and was\r\ncanonized as a Saint by Edward III., son of the King who condemned him.\r\nMiracles were said to be wrought at his tomb; and a Church was built, for\r\npilgrims to the place where he was executed.  (Rapin’s Hist. vol. i. for\r\n396; Boothroyd’s “Hist. Pontefract” pp. 95, &c).\r\n\r\n{108}  To show the power and lawlessness of some of these Lords of Kirkby\r\nand Tumby, it is recorded that the servants of this Simon de Driby took a\r\nwaggon, with a hogshead of wine, from Louth to Tumby, by their master’s\r\norders, and there forcibly detained it, “to the damage of 60s.” a large\r\nsum in those days.  (“Hundred Rolls,” p. 333.)\r\n\r\n{109a}  The last Baron D’Eyncourt died in the reign of Henry VI.  His\r\nsister married Ralph Lord Cromwell.  Probably from this connection the\r\nwarden of Tattershall College had lands in Kirton (“Peerage,” vol. ii.,\r\np. 62, and Tanner’s “Notitiæ,” p. 286.)  The D’Eyncourts still survive at\r\nBayons Manor, near Market Rasen.  Their ancestors came over with the\r\nConqueror, and held many manors in Lincolnshire.  Walter D’Eyncourt was a\r\ngreat benefactor to Kirkstead Abbey in the reign of Ed. I. (Madox,\r\n“Baronia Anglica,” p. 217.)  The first Walter was a near relative of\r\nBishop Remigius, who also accompanied the Conqueror.  A tomb was opened\r\nin Lincoln Cathedral in 1741 supposed to be that of this Walter, and the\r\nbody was found carefully sewn up in leather.\r\n\r\n{109b}  Of another of the Cromwells, a few years later, it is found by a\r\nChancery Inquisition post mortem (15 Hen. VI., No. 71) that, to prove his\r\nbirth, John Hackthorne, of Walmsgare, testifies that he saw him baptized;\r\nand being asked how he knows this, he says that, on the said day, he saw\r\nThomas Hauley, knight, lift the said infant, Robert Cromwell, at the\r\nfont.  This Sir Robert was succeeded by Ralph Lord Cromwell in 1442.\r\nThis Sir T. Hauley also presented to the benefice of Candlesby, next\r\nafter Matilda, wife of Ralph Lord Cromwell (“Linc. N. and Q,” vi., p.\r\n76.)  Thus there was a Hawley connected with the place at that early\r\nperiod, but, as will be shown further on, the family of the present Sir\r\nH. M. Hawley did not obtain their property here till more than 300 years\r\nlater (“Architect S. Journal,” xxiii., p. 125).\r\n\r\n{111}  In former times parsons had the title “Sir,” not as being Knights,\r\nor Baronets, but as the translation of “Dominus,” now rendered by\r\n“Reverend.”\r\n\r\n{115a}  In those days the wild boar, as well as deer, were plentiful in\r\nour forests, and were protected by royal statute.  The punishment for\r\nanyone killing a boar, without the King’s licence, was the loss of his\r\neyes.  They became extinct about A.D., 1620; as to the deer, an old\r\nPatent Roll (13, Richard II., pt. 1, m. 3), mentions that a toll of one\r\nhalf penny was leviable on every “100 skins of roebuck, foxes, hares,\r\n&c.,” brought for sale to the Horncastle market.  This would look as\r\nthough roe-deer at least, were then fairly plentiful.\r\n\r\n{115b}  For further particulars of this family see “History of the\r\nAyscoughs,” by J. Conway Walter, published by W. K. Morton, Horncastle.\r\nHenry Ascoughe, by his will, dated 16 Nov. 1601, desires to be buried in\r\nthe parish church of Moorbye (“Maddison’s Wills.”)\r\n\r\n{117a}  Two different things were formerly meant by the term “graduale,”\r\nor “grayle.”  (1) It was the name given to the Communion Chalice, or\r\nPaten, probably from the “Sangraal,” or holy vessel, said to have been\r\nfound in the chamber of “the last supper,” of our Lord, by Joseph of\r\nArimathæa, and in which he afterwards collected the blood (sang-reale, or\r\nKing’s blood), from the wounds of the crucified Saviour.  This vessel, in\r\nArthurian romance, was said to have been preserved in Britain, and to\r\nhave possessed miraculous properties.  The legend has been finely adopted\r\nby our late Poet Laureate in the “Quest of the Holy Grayle,” among his\r\n“Idylls of the King.”  (2). The name was given to a part of the service\r\nof the Mass in pre-Reformation times, which was called the “Gradual,” or\r\ngrail, because it was used at the steps (“gradus”) of the chancel.  As\r\nthe inscription on the first-named of these Kirkby tombs mentioned the\r\ngift of a “Missal,” or mass book, it is probable that the “gradual” here\r\nmentioned was this portion of the mass book, and not the Communion\r\nChalice, or Paten.  The Communion plate of Kirkby does not appear to be\r\nvery old.\r\n\r\n{117b}  The writer of these Records has also a copy of this engraving, it\r\nis dated 1800, and has the initials, E. C.  The church is represented\r\nwith the roof fallen in, the porch closed by rails, south wall of nave,\r\nwith two 3-light windows, in a dilapidated## condition, a priest’s door\r\nin chancel, with two 2-light windows above it, a shabby low tower, with\r\npinnacles, scarcely rising above the roof, the whole overgrown with\r\nweeds; and churchyard and grave-stones in a neglected state.\r\n\r\n{119}  In the reign of Ed. I. it was complained that the too powerful\r\nAbbot of Kirkstead erected a gallows at Thimbleby (being patron of that\r\nbenefice), where he executed various offenders (“Hundred Rolls,” p. 299),\r\nand Simon de Tumby had gallows at Ashby Puerorum, of which there is\r\nprobably still a trace, in “Galley Lane” in that parish.  (“Hundred\r\nRolls,” 1275).\r\n\r\n{121}  The Kings held property in this neighbourhood late in the 16th\r\ncentury.  By will, dated Jan. 23, 1614, Edwd. King, of Ashby, bequeathed\r\nto his son John the manor house of Salmonby, and it was not till 1595\r\nthat the Hall of Ashby de la Laund was built.\r\n\r\n{122}  This conduit still exists.  “Linc. & Q.” vol. iv. p. 131.\r\n\r\n{123a}  At Greetham there is a field called Gousles, or Gouts-leys.  We\r\nfind the same in Gautby.  “St. Peter at Gowt’s,” in Lincoln; and “Gaut”\r\nis a common term for the outlets of fen and marsh drains.\r\n\r\n{123b}  There is in Hameringham a Baldvine gaire, given by the clerk to\r\nthe Revesby Monks.  See notes on Hameringham.\r\n\r\n{123c}  The name Massenge is not a common one, but we find that Thomas\r\nMasinge was presented to the Vicarage of Frampton, by King Philip and\r\nQueen Mary, 6 August, 1556 (‘Lincolnshire Institutions,’ “Linc. N. & Q,”\r\nvol. v., p. 165.)\r\n\r\n{123d}  The Goodricks were a fairly good family, originally settled at\r\nNortingley, Somersetshire; but the Lincolnshire branch came from the\r\nmarriage of Henry, son of Robert Goodrick, with the heiress daughter of\r\nThomas Stickford of this county.  According to one version, one of his\r\ndescendants, Edward Goderich, of East Kirkby, married as his second wife,\r\nJane, daughter and heir of a Mr. Williamson of Boston, whose children\r\nwere Henry, Thomas (Lord Chancellor), John, Katherine, and Elizabeth; of\r\nwhom John married the daughter and co-heiress of Sir Lionel Dymoke, of\r\nStickford.  According to another version, the John, of Bolingbroke, who\r\ndied in 1493, had two sons, William and Richard.  William was of East\r\nKirkby, and was father of (1) the John, above-named, who married Miss\r\nDymoke, (2) Henry, ancestor of the Goodricks, baronets, of Yorkshire, and\r\n(3) Thomas, Bishop of Ely, and Lord Chancellor, temp. Ed. VI., and one of\r\nthe compilers of the Reformed Liturgy (“Linc. N. & Q,” vol. i., p. 122).\r\nIn the reign of Elizabeth, Edward Goodrick, of East Kirkby, subscribed\r\n£25 to the Armada Fund (“Linc. N. and Q.,” vol. ii., p. 132; “Architect.\r\nS. Journal,” 1894, p. 214.)\r\n\r\n{124a}  See “Notes” on Salmonby and Raithby.\r\n\r\n{124b}  The term “exhibition” is equivalent to maintenance; Edward was\r\nevidently studying for “the Bar,” and this was provision for him until he\r\nshould be able to “practice at the Bar,” as counsel in legal suits.  The\r\nterm exhibition is still used at the Universities, along with\r\n“scholarship,” for certain allowances, which are granted to students,\r\nafter examination, to aid them in their University course.\r\n\r\n{125a}  The Sapcotes were a well-to-do middle-class family.  In 1554\r\nThomas Chamberlaine, clerk, was presented to the Church of Lee, Lincoln\r\nDiocese, by Edward Sapcote, gentleman, one of the executors of the will\r\nof Henry Sapcote, late alderman of the City of Lincoln (‘Lincoln\r\nInstitutions,’ “Linc. N. and Q,” v., p. 173.)  William Sapcote was Rector\r\nof Belchford in 1558.  By a Chancery Inquisition post mortem, dated at\r\nHornecastell, 4 Nov., 23 Henry VII. (1507), the manor of Taunton\r\n(Toynton) and advowson of Nether Taunton with other property were\r\nrecovered for Thomas Sapcote, and Joan his wife, and other parties.\r\n(“Architect. S. Journal,” 1895, pp. 61–2.)\r\n\r\n{125b}  The Palfreyman family resided at Lusby.  They were descended from\r\nWilliam Palfreyman, who was Mayor of Lincoln in 1536.  Mr. E. Palfreyman\r\ncontributed “1 launce and 1 light horse” to the defence of the country\r\nwhen the Spanish Armada was expected; one of them is named among the List\r\nof Gentry in the county, on the Herald’s Visitation in 1643 (“Linc. N. &\r\nQ,” ii., p. 73.)  Ralph Palfreyman was presented to the Vicarage of\r\nEdlington in 1869, by Anthony Palfreyman, merchant of the Staple, Lincoln\r\n(“Architect, S. Journal,” 1897, p. 15.)\r\n\r\n{126}  The Grynnees were “nativi,” or tenants in bondage; yet, as\r\nsometimes happens in modern days, a son married the daughter of a knight.\r\nThey were attached to the manor of Ingoldmells, which then belonged to\r\nthe King.\r\n\r\n{127a}  The prefix may either be Ea _i.e._ Eau, water, or Ey, Ea, island.\r\nThe small islands in the Thames are called eyots.\r\n\r\n{127b}  By an Inquisition taken at Partney, 8 Sep. 7 Hen. VIII (A.D.\r\n1491), it was found that Bernard Eland, son of Eustace Eland, late of\r\nStirton, Esquire is an idiot, and that he has an infirmity called “Morbus\r\nCaducus; and he held his manor of Stirton of the lord the King, by the\r\nservice of two parts of a knight’s fee.”  (“Archit. S. Journ.” 1195, p.\r\n74).\r\n\r\n{128}  By an Inquisition, 20 Hen. vii (A.D. 1504, 5), held at Lincoln, it\r\nwas found that John Billsby and Nicholas Eland were seized of the manor\r\nof Malbissh-Enderby, with appurtenances in Hagworthingham and also of the\r\nmanor of Bag Enderby, with appurtenances in Somersby, &c.\r\n\r\n{129}  This rood-screen has been reproduced in late years in the restored\r\nchurches of Brant Broughton and Thornton Curtis.  (“Linc. N. & Q.,” 1896,\r\np. 49).\r\n\r\n{131}  Of Thomas Goodrick, Bishop of Ely, we may observe that he was\r\nrather a “timeserver,” though one of the supporters of Lady Jane Grey,\r\nand acting on her Council during her nine days’ reign.  On the accession\r\nof Queen Mary, he did homage to her, and was allowed to retain his\r\nbishopric.  The historian says of him, that “he was a busy\r\nsecular-spirited man, given up to factions and intrigues of state,\r\npreferring to keep his bishopric before the discharge of his conscience.”\r\n\r\nThe name was probably originally spelt Gode-rich, and a Latin epigram was\r\ncomposed, in allusion to this, as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “Et bonus et dives, bene junctus et optimus ordo,\r\n    Prœcedit bonitas, pone sequuntur opes”;\r\n\r\nwhich may be Englishised thus:—\r\n\r\n    “Both _good_ and _rich_, duly combined,\r\n    The good in front, the rich behind.”\r\n\r\nThere is probably a trace of the Goodrick family in a carved stone over\r\nthe kitchen door at the farmhouse close by the church, on which the\r\ndevice is a cross “fitchée,” rising from another recumbent cross,\r\ncombined with a circle, between the initials L and G, with the date above\r\n1544.\r\n\r\n{133}  Our modern rock-salt was unknown till 1670, when it was\r\naccidentally found in Cheshire.  Before that time the only salt in use,\r\nwas that collected by evaporation, in “salt-pans,” on the Humber or the\r\nsea-coast.  Of these, Sharon Turner calculates (“Hist. Anglo-Saxons,”\r\nvol. iii., p. 251, Ed., 1836), that there were no less than 361 in the\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\n{135}  Mills almost invariably belonged to the lord of the manor, and\r\nwere a source of considerable profit, as at these only were the tenants\r\nallowed to have their grain ground.  As an evidence of their value it may\r\nbe mentioned that the Bishop of Worcester had, in the parish of\r\nStratford, two carucates of land, or 240 acres, which were rated at\r\n20_s._, whereas a mill belonging to him, yielded 100_s._  He let his land\r\nat the annual rent of 5_d._ per acre, but his mill was let for £5.  When\r\nthe Conqueror’s Commissioners visited Lincolnshire, there were between\r\n400 and 500 mills in the county.\r\n\r\n{137}  We have an instance of a similar formation in the name of\r\nKingerby, near Market Rasen; which in a Chancery Inquisition, post mort.,\r\nV.O., Ric. III. and Henry VII., No. 116a, is given as Kyngardby.\r\n\r\n{138}  In Morris’s Directory, of 1863, the total is given as only 730\r\nacres.\r\n\r\n{139}  Privately translated and printed for the late Right Honble. E.\r\nStanhope, M.P., of Revesby.\r\n\r\n{140}  A selion is a ridge of land between two furrows.\r\n\r\n{142a}  This double-arched doorway has been pronounced by some to be\r\nSaxon (“Linc. N. & Q.” 1896, p. 4), but about 1090 there was a revival of\r\nSaxon ornament, which was continued for some time into the Norman period\r\n(“Linc. N & Q.” 1895, p. 225, note.)\r\n\r\n{142b}  These details are taken from the description given by the late\r\nPrecentor Venables, on the visit of the Architectural Society, in 1894.\r\n\r\n{145a}  The Fitzwilliams were a wealthy family, having large possessions\r\nin this county and elsewhere, and, at a later period, were created earls\r\nof Southampton.\r\n\r\n{145b}  The Crevecœurs would seem to have derived their name from\r\nCreveceur, a town with the title of Marquis, in the province of Masseran,\r\nin Italy (“General Hist. of World,” by Dan Browne, 1721, p. 160.)  There\r\nwas, however, another old town of this name in Holland, remarkable for\r\nits strong fortress, which, from its impregnability, was named Creveceur,\r\nor heart-break (Ibidem, p. 122).  The arms of this family were “or, a\r\ncross, voided, gules” (“Magna Charta,” p. 100.)\r\n\r\n{147}  These various records are taken from “Lincolnshire Wills,” &c., by\r\nCanon Maddison.\r\n\r\n{148}  In Bag Enderby church there is a mural monument to Andrew and\r\nDorothy Gedney, and their two sons and two daughters kneeling by prayer\r\ndesks.\r\n\r\n{156a}  Ralph Lord Treasurer Cromwell had also property in this parish at\r\na later period.\r\n\r\n{156b}  A former church was built by the Lord Treasurer, who died in\r\n1455; in the nave of which was the inscription, “Orate pro anima Radulph\r\nCrumwell qui incepit hoc opus, Anno Domini 1450.”  (Harl. MSS. No. 6829,\r\np. 174).\r\n\r\n{157a}  In the “Gentleman’s Magazine” for 1789, p. 636, is an account of\r\na beacon hill in this parish.\r\n\r\n{157b}  The objection to this is that “reeve” is a Saxon word, and the\r\ntermination “by” is Danish.  The word appears in our modern “sheriff,” or\r\nshire-reeve, “port-reeve,” &c.\r\n\r\n{158a}  Jusseraud’s “Life of the 14th Century,” p. 38.\r\n\r\n{158b}  Harleyan MSS. 4127.\r\n\r\n{158c}  Ibid, add. MSS., 6118, 330_b_.\r\n\r\n{158d}  The original charter of the foundation is lost, but a copy is\r\ngiven in Dugdale’s “Monasticon,” vol. v. p. 454.  The wife of this\r\nWilliam de Romara was Hawise, daughter of Richard de Redvers, Lord of\r\nTiverton, Co. Devon, and of Christchurch, Hants., and sister to Baldwin,\r\n1st Earl of Devon.  By the title of Comitissa Hawysia de Romara, she gave\r\nthe church of Feltham, in Middlesex, to the hospital of St.\r\nGiles-in-the-Fields, near London.  She joined in the foundation of\r\nRevesby Abbey.  (“Topogr. and Genealogist,” vol. i., p. 24).\r\n\r\n{158e}  Dugdale’s “Baronage,” vol. i. p. 6.\r\n\r\n{159}  Gelt was a tax of 2_s._ on each carucate, or 120 acres.\r\n\r\n{160}  It is customary to speak of Revesby Abbey as the monastery of St.\r\nLaurence, but it would also appear at an early period to have been\r\ndedicated to the Virgin Mother as well; for, while the inscription on the\r\ntomb of the founder, as given above, mentions only St. Laurence, Dugdale\r\nin his “Monasticon” (p. 531), calls it “the Monastery of our blessed Lady\r\nthe Virgin, and St. Lawrans.”  Further, one impression of the Abbey seal\r\nis preserved in the office of the Duchy of Lancaster, and another at the\r\nBritish Museum; and they are inscribed “Sigillum Abbatis d’ St.\r\nLaurentio”; but there is also in the British Museum, a seal of “Henry,\r\nAbbot of St. Mary’s;” and another of “the Abbey and Convent of St. Mary,”\r\nis among the Harleian Charters (44, z 2), and both the latter have, as\r\npart of their device, the Virgin, crowned, holding the Infant Christ in\r\nher arms.\r\n\r\n{161}  It is curious to find a Doctor among the slaves, he may have been\r\na foster-brother to one of better birth.  Barcaria, in Monkish Latin\r\nmeant a tanning house (from “bark,”) or a sheep-fold, Norman French,\r\n“Bergerie,” and Barkarius may have been a tanner or shepherd.\r\n\r\n{164}  I am indebted for these details to the accounts printed by the\r\nlate E. Stanhope, for private circulation, and the Revesby deeds and\r\ncharters, which he recovered, and also printed.\r\n\r\n{166}  Saunders in his “History of Lincolnshire,” 1836, gives the patron\r\nof Revesby as Revd. C. N. L’oste.  This, however, is an error, that\r\ngentleman being chaplain in 1831, and there then being no residence he\r\nresided at Horncastle, as many other country incumbents did at that time.\r\nThe L’ostes held various preferments in this neighbourhood for more than\r\none generation.  In 1706, before the Banks family owned Revesby, the\r\nRevd. C. L’oste held the Rectory of Langton-by-Horncastle.  He was a man\r\nof some attainments, and published a poetical translation of Grotius on\r\nthe Christian Religion, which the writer of these notes possesses.\r\nAnother L’oste, at that date resided in Louth; and, within living memory,\r\nanother of the name resided in Horncastle.\r\n\r\n{178}  The Pelhams of old were a martial family.  At the battle of\r\nPoitiers, the King of France surrendered to John de Pelham, and this\r\nbadge was adopted by him as representing the sword-belt buckle of the\r\ndefeated monarch, and became conspicuous on their residences, or in the\r\nchurches which they endowed.\r\n\r\n{181}  For an interesting life of Mr. Hanserd Knollys, see Crosby’s\r\n“History of English Baptists,” vol. i, p. 334, &c.\r\n\r\n{182}  Odo was the son of Herluin de Contaville and Arlette, coucubine of\r\nRobert, Duke of Normandy, so that Odo and the Conqueror were sons of the\r\nsame mother.  The Earl of Moretaine, and Adeliza, Countess d’ Aumaile,\r\nwere his brother and sister.\r\n\r\n{184}  It has been suggested that this represented Belshazzar’s Feast\r\n(“Architect. S. Journal,” 1858, p. lxxiii), but this would hardly be in\r\nkeeping with the other subjects.\r\n\r\n{185}  The next ford on the Witham, southward, was Kirkstead wharf, or\r\nmore properly “wath,” which is still the local pronunciation; “wath,”\r\nmeaning “ford,” corresponding to the Latin “vadum,” and related to our\r\nword to “wade,” or “ford,” a stream, &c.  There is a village called Wath\r\nin Yorkshire, which is near a ford or causeway over a Marsh.  (“Archit.\r\nJourn.” xiii, p. 75).\r\n\r\n{186a}  Mr. T. W. Shore, in an interesting article on “The Roads and\r\nFords of Hampshire.”  (“Archæolog. Review,” vol. iii., pp. 89–98), says\r\nthat all the “Stokes” (a common local name), are connected with “wades,”\r\nor fords on streams, probably because they were stockaded.  Stockholm,\r\nmeans a staked, or stockaded island.  In South America there is a plain\r\ncalled Llano Estacedo, because the tracks across it are marked by stakes.\r\n(“Greater Britain,” Sir C. Dilke, p. 75.)\r\n\r\n{186b}  This was the case with a manorial wood, formerly on the property\r\nof the Bishops of Winchester, at Havant, in Hants.  (“Archæol. Review,”\r\niii., p. 94), one of the conditions of tenure being, that it should\r\nfurnish stakes for a “wade-way,” from the main land to Hayling Island,\r\nfordable by carts at low water, and stockaded on both sides.\r\n\r\n{186c}  In connection with this, it is not a little interesting to note\r\nthat, according to the Hundred Rolls (pp. 317 and 397), quoted Oliver’s\r\n“Religious Houses,” (p. 72, note 25), the prioress of Stixwould was\r\naccused in the reign of Ed. I., of obstructing the passage of ships on\r\nthe Witham, “by turfs and faggots” (“turbis et fagotis”); this would\r\nprobably be by making the ford shallower by sods, and narrower by bundles\r\nof stakes or sticks.\r\n\r\n{186d}  Streatfeild (“Lincolnshire and the Danes,” pp. 147–8,) says “the\r\nswampy locality would favour the idea of the stakes,” as originating the\r\nname.\r\n\r\n{186e}  Called by Ingulphus “Patria Girviorum.”  (“Hist. Rerum. Anglic.”\r\nVol. i., p. 5, A.D. 716).\r\n\r\n{187}  The name Siward may not have been confined to one person; but the\r\nold chronicler, Ordericus Vitalis (A.D. 1142), tells the following, of\r\nthe great Earl Waltheof, son of Siward, that he was beheaded (probably\r\nbeing too powerful a Saxon subject to suit the Conqueror), on May 31,\r\n1076, at Winchester, and buried on the spot of his execution.  The monks\r\nof Croyland, however, begged that his body might be removed to their\r\nAbbey; and this was granted and carried out a fortnight after his death.\r\nHe was then buried in the Chapter House.  Sixteen years afterwards, the\r\nabbot, Ingulphus, decided to remove the treasured remains from the\r\nChapter House to the Church, and ordered the bones to be first washed\r\nwith warm water.  When the coffin lid was removed, the body was not only\r\nfound to be as fresh as at the first burial, but the head had become\r\nre-united to the body, only a red streak showing the place of severance.\r\nThe body was re-interred near the high altar with great ceremony, and it\r\nis added (and no wonder, after this one miracle) that “miracles were\r\noften performed” at the tomb.  (“Fenland N. & Q.” 1892, pp. 37–8).\r\n\r\n{188}  Although nothing is said, so far as we know, of Ivo leaving any\r\nprogeny, the name of Taillebois survived for some centuries, being\r\nrepresented by men of wealth, large property, and good connections in the\r\ncounty.  Their chief seat was South Kyme, where the head of this house\r\nsucceeded Gilbert de Umfravill, Earl of Angus, and where his descendants\r\nwere, in turn, succeeded by the Dymokes.  In the 15th century their\r\nfortunes declined, and by a Close Roll of Henry VII. (9 May, 1494), it is\r\nshewn that William Taillebois, then of Baumber, had got into the hands of\r\na London money-lender, and that his estates were handed over to Sir\r\nRobert Dymoke, and other creditors, who made him an allowance of £20 a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n{189a}  Judging by the dates, they could hardly have been one and the\r\nsame lady.  This question is fully examined by J. G. Nichols, F.S.A., in\r\n“Proceedings of the Archæological Institute,” 1848, who decides in favour\r\nof two distinct persons, the latter being mother of William de Romara\r\n(temp. Stephen), afterwards Earl of Lincoln.\r\n\r\n{189b}  From the title, d’ Alencon, it is probable that the name, once\r\nnot uncommon in this neighbourhood, of Dalyson arose.\r\n\r\n{194}  Dugdale (“Monasticon,” v., p. 725), says Sir Geoffrey de Ezmondeys\r\ngave to Stixwold Priory certain lands at Honington, then called\r\nHuntingdon.  These lands still belonged to the Priory, temp. Henry VIII.\r\nThe name is spelt Ermondeys in a second Deed in Dugdale; it is Ermondys\r\nin the Hundred Rolls (i. 393).  In “Testa de Nevill,” (p. 323) it _is_\r\nabbreviated as “Armets”; while in p. 342 of the same Henry de Armenters\r\nis given as owner of the same lands.\r\n\r\n{196a}  Not many years ago there was preserved in the church of the not\r\ndistant parish of Scopwick, a richly-embroidered satin pulpit cloth,\r\nprobably a specimen of such work; but the Vicar, unfortunately, converted\r\nit into window curtains, and it has been lost.  (Oliver, p. 72, n. 23.)\r\n\r\n{196b}  The Harleian MS., in the British Museum, shows buxom dames\r\nshooting stags and boars with the bow, mounted astride on horseback.\r\nItalian and Dutch artists shew the same.  Lady Superiors were wont thus\r\nto relieve the montony of conventual life.  It is related of Queen\r\nElizabeth, that when 60 years old, she shot four deer before breakfast.\r\n“Standard,” ‘leader,’ Oct. 12th, 1898.\r\n\r\n{197}  There may be seen in Horncastle, at the house of Mr. Soulby\r\nHunter, of Horncastle, a very beautifully-carved boss of stone, which was\r\nonce in the roof of the Priory chapel, or church; it is circular, more\r\nthan 2ft. in diameter, and 6 portions of arches branch off from it.  Its\r\nsize indicates that the fabric must have been on a large scale and lofty.\r\nThere is also at the same house a finely-carved figure of a crouching\r\nlion, which may have formed part of a frieze, or cornice of the same\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n{198}  This stone consists of a square block, the carved device being a\r\ncross within a circle, on the four arms of which are letters, which,\r\ntaking a central E as common to all, form the words “Lex Dei Est Vera,”\r\n‘the law of God is true.’  The stone was taken to Lincoln, and placed in\r\nthe west gable of a house built by the late Mr. E. J. Willson.  (“Linc.\r\nN. & Q.” vol. i., p. 124).  It was engraved in “Archæological Journal,”\r\nvol. ix., p. 97.\r\n\r\n{199}  This Boulton was, for his crime, hanged at Lincoln; but his body\r\nbrought to be buried in the old church.  When the present church was\r\nbuilt, his body was removed, with others, and re-interred in the\r\nchurchyard.  His remains are, locally, said to have differed from all the\r\nothers, in that there were still large lumps of fat about the skeleton.\r\nThis may probably be accounted for by the fact that he died in the full\r\nvigour of life.  Some of the Boultons formerly resided at Hall-garth,\r\nThimbleby; others lived at Sturton-by-Stow, and left moneys for the poor\r\nof that parish.\r\n\r\n{202}  Thomas Welby, in his will, proved 18th August, 1524, desired “to\r\nbe buried in the church of Stixwould, before the image of our Lady.”  The\r\nWelbys are now one of the leading county families, yet we find this very\r\nname of “Thomas Welby of Moulton,” mentioned in the “Myntling MS.” of\r\nSpalding Priory, as among the bondmen of that monastery.  25 Edward III.,\r\n(1352).  Thomas Grantham, living at Newstead farm, Stixwould, 40 years\r\nago, probably of the above Grantham family, was a great hunting man.  His\r\nbrother, Redding Grantham, is buried at Woodhall Spa.\r\n\r\n{203}  For many of these particulars I am indebted to the account of\r\nHalstead Hall, by the Rev. J. A. Penny, given in “Linc. N. & Q.,” vol.\r\niii., pp. 33–37.\r\n\r\n{204}  The bricks of this structure resemble those of Tattershall Castle\r\n(built about 1440), and of the Tower-on-the-Moor; they were formerly\r\nsupposed to be Dutch bricks, brought by boat up the Witham; but\r\ngeologists tells us that they are made of the local clay.\r\n\r\n{206a}  A cast was taken of Tiger Tom’s head, after the execution, and a\r\nmould from it now forms an ornament over the door of a house, No. 31,\r\nBoston Road, Horncastle, which formerly belonged to Mr. William Boulton.\r\nHe witnessed the execution, and procured the cast at the time.\r\n\r\n{206b}  One of the gang was hanged on March 27, 1829; the two above-named\r\non March 19, the next year, 1830; a fourth was captured two years later,\r\nbut escaped hanging, as it was pleaded on his behalf, that he had\r\nprevented Timothy Brammar, a reckless fellow, from shooting Mr. Elsey, or\r\nill-treating the maids.  He, however, had formerly been a servant at the\r\nhouse, knew the premises well, and was said to have planned the whole\r\nproceedings; he was transported.  There were said to be ten men in the\r\ngang, all “bankers,” _i.e._, “navvies.”  Mr. T. Mitchell, parish clerk of\r\nWoodhall, informs me that two of the men confined in the stables were\r\nnamed Henry Oldfield and George Croft; names frequently appearing in the\r\nparish registers and still common in the neighbourhood.  George Croft\r\ndied at Langton, January 18, 1878.  Henry Oldfield’s daughter, still\r\nliving (1904), says that she remembers her mother stating that she saw\r\nsix of the men hanged, at one time or another, and heard the trial of the\r\nlast two, when the judge remarked “What, the case from Halstead Hall;\r\nshall we ever have done with it?”  Most of these particulars are given in\r\n“Records of Woodhall Spa” (1899), and for them I am indebted to Mr. and\r\nMrs. Longstaff, now residing at Halstead Hall.\r\n\r\n{209}  The parish register has the entry “Alison ye wife of Rob. Diton\r\nwas buried ye 14 Jany., 1688,” and as none of the name are mentioned\r\nagain, they probably became extinct with this Robert.\r\n\r\n{210}  It has been doubted, of late, whether there ever was a tower; but\r\nit is referred to by Mr. Jeans, in Murray’s “Handbook for Lincolnshire,”\r\nalso in several old Directories, and the Parish Terrier, dated June 27,\r\n1724, mentions among the church possessions “Three bells and a\r\nting-tang.”  The existence of this tower is further confirmed by the fact\r\nthat in the churchyard is the tombstone of a Mr. Wattam (a name still\r\nsurviving in the parish), the churchwarden who caused the tower to be\r\ntaken down.  He was afterwards killed by lightning, and the villagers\r\nregarded this as a “judgment” upon him for removing the tower and bells.\r\n\r\n{219a}  See my volume “Records of Woodhall Spa and Neighbourhood,” pp.\r\n140–2, where this particular case of Fulstow is also mentioned.\r\n\r\n{219b}  In connection with Joyce Dighton, widow of Robert Dighton, of\r\nStourton, there is a record that she left her two sons, Robert and\r\nWilliam, her leases in Waddingworth, and in Maidenwell, Louth.  This\r\nindicates a connection. The Waddingworth property had belonged to\r\nTupholme Abbey.  Maidenwell, also, was a sacred place, where is still a\r\nwell, in the cellar of the manor house, which I have seen, dedicated to\r\nthe “Maiden,” _i.e._, Virgin.\r\n\r\n{220a}  I quote from the list made out by the Rev. C. W. Foster\r\n(“Architectural Society’s Journal,” vol. xxiv., p. 12).\r\n\r\n{220b}  This Mr. Rutland Snowden, gent., gave to the poor of Horncastle\r\none house, of the yearly value of 26s., but, being decayed, this is now\r\nreduced to 13s., paid in bread, sixpence every other Sunday.  The house\r\nbelongs now to Mr. Willm. Dawson.  (Weir’s “Hist. of Horncastle,” p. 33,\r\ned. 1820.)\r\n\r\n{221}  Thomas Loddington, LL.D., was Vicar of Horncastle at the beginning\r\nof the 18th century.  His name is on one of the church bells, cast in\r\n1717.\r\n\r\n{227}  St. Margaret was tortured and beheaded by Polybius, Roman\r\npresident of the East (who wished to marry her), because she refused to\r\nabjure her faith in the Saviour.  She died A.D., 278.  Her holy day, July\r\n20, is very ancient, not only in the Roman Church, but also in the Greek\r\nChurch, which celebrates her memory, under the name of Marina.\r\n\r\n{228}  The writer of this notice has a copy of this quaint production.\r\nIt is entitled, “God’s Arke, overtopping the world’s waves, or The Third\r\nPart of the Parliamentary Chronicle, collected and published, for God’s\r\nhigh Honour, and the great encouragement of all that are zealous for God,\r\nand lovers of their Country.  By the most unworthy admirer of them, John\r\nVickers, London.  Printed by M. Simons & F. Macock.  3rd edition, 1646.”\r\nThe 1st edition was probably issued soon after the battle.\r\n\r\n{230a}  Of these Colonel Shelley was taken in the water.  Sir George\r\nBolle, a member of a very old Lincolnshire family, was killed with Sir\r\nIngram Hopton, and Major Askew, of another old Lincolnshire family was\r\ntaken prisoner.  (“Winceby Fight,” a Legend, by Alan Cheales, M.A.)\r\n\r\n{230b}  The writer once found on Langton Hill, within a quarter of a mile\r\nof Horncastle, the rowell of a spur with very long spikes, which was\r\nprobably lost by a fugitive Cavalier after the fight.  He has also a pair\r\nof spurs which were ploughed up on the battle field; and he has also a\r\npistol of peculiar construction, found in a ditch near Woodhall Spa,\r\nwhich had probably been lost by a fleeing trooper.\r\n\r\n{231}  There are more than 2000 place-names in England which contain this\r\nelement: from the county names of Nott-ing-hamshire and\r\nBuck-ing-hamshire, to Wolsingham, to the North, in Durham; and Hastings\r\non the South coast of Sussex.\r\n\r\n{233}  The Beks, who have been mentioned before in this volume, became a\r\npowerful and wealthy family.  They attained to the honour of Knighthood,\r\nand Barony, married into families of good position, acquired the\r\nConstableship of Lincoln Castle, and were especially strong in Bishops;\r\nfour members of the family being raised to the episcopate, one as Bishop\r\nof Lincoln, then the largest See in the Kingdom, another as Bishop of\r\nDurham.  Of this last it is related that he was so enormously wealthy\r\nthat his ordinary retinue consisted of 140 knights.  Hearing that a piece\r\nof cloth was said to be “too costly for even the Bishop of Durham,” he at\r\nonce bought it, and had it cut up into horse cloths.  While he was\r\nstaying in Rome, a Cardinal greatly admired his horses.  He thereupon\r\nsent two of the best with his compliments, begging the Cardinal to take\r\nwhich he preferred.  The cardinal _took both_; whereat the Bishop drily\r\nremarked, “He _has_ chosen the best.”\r\n\r\n{234}  That a connection of Beks and Willoughbys with Kirkstead Abbey\r\nexisted before this, is shewn by the following documents.  Walter Bek,\r\nfirst Baron of Willoughby, by will, dated July 20, 1301, directed that\r\nhis body should “be buried at Kirkstede, whereunto he gives his best\r\nhorse (price 40 marks), his mail-coat, gauntlets, targe and lance,” and\r\nother accoutrements, Sir Willm. Willoughby being his executor.  An old\r\nCharter exists (Harleian MS., 45. h. 14), by which “John Bek, Lord of\r\nEresby, makes known to all sons of Holy Mother Church,” that he grants\r\nand confirms “to God and the Church of the blessed Mary of Kyrkested, and\r\nto the Monks there serving God, in pure and perpetual alms, all the gifts\r\nand confirmations, which (his) ancestors made to them”; one of the\r\nwitnesses to this being “Dominus William de Wylcheby.”\r\n\r\n{235}  By a curious coincidence, we find 120 years later, another William\r\nHardigray, doubtless a descendant of this, occupying the post of master,\r\nwith sundry “fellows” under him, of the Chantry of the Holy Trinity, at\r\nSpilsby; and to him, and his Institution, Sir William Willoughby, in\r\n1406, granted certain lands in Scremby and elsewhere, to augment the\r\nendowment; a further bequest being made by Robert, Lord Willoughby, in\r\n1452.  (“History of Spilsby,” p. 46, by H. Cotton Smith.)\r\n\r\n{236}  The Glovers would seem to have been of some antiquity in the\r\nneighbourhood.  In an Inquisition, taken at Sleaford, A.D. 1506, as to\r\nthe estate of Mawncer Marmeon, among the jurors is William Glover, of\r\nPanton.  (Architect. Soc. Journal, vol. xxiii., pt. i., pp. 55 and 69).\r\nWhile, in another Inquisition taken at Spalding in the same year, among\r\nthe jurors is Robert Glover (Ibidem); and in another Inquisition taken at\r\nFalkingham, 3 years later, we find Thomas Phillips of Stamford, and John\r\nObys, clerk, seized of the manor of Casewick (Ibidem, p. 80).\r\n\r\n{237}  The bricks of the former residence itself are said to have been\r\nused in repairing Baumber Church many years ago.\r\n\r\n{238a}  Some anecdotes are told of this worthy.  A friend, who, in his\r\nearly years, received some tuition from him, relates that he once took\r\nhim to the top of the church tower, and waving his arms around, exclaimed\r\n“All this should be mine, every inch of it.”  He planted an apple tree,\r\nwhen each of his numerous progeny was born; two or three of which still\r\nbear fruit in the vicarage orchard.  He is said to have been a skilful\r\nboxer, and to have thrashed a big bully at Thimbleby.  Being accused by a\r\nclerical superior, of frequenting public houses, and drinking too much,\r\nhe replied, “I am not the only man who has been accused of being a\r\ngluttonous man and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.”  He\r\nwas evidently well able to hold his own with tongue as well as fist,\r\nalthough the valuable patrimony slipt through his fingers.\r\n\r\n{238b}  He was intimate with Prout, De Wint, Cattermole, and other\r\nartists of his day, his own paintings in sepia being well-known and\r\nhighly valued.  The writer of these Records possesses several of them,\r\nand among them, the gift of Mr. Terrot, a painting of Stonehenge, the\r\noriginal of which was presented by the artist to King Edward, on his\r\nvisit to Stonehenge, as Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\n{238c}  These capitals are still preserved in the vestry.\r\n\r\n{240}  The triple cross is said to be the sign of a Royal Arch-Mason, and\r\nin Mr. Terrot’s own window are signs of the four Masonic crafts.\r\n\r\n{241}  The Hannaths had one other child, a girl, who married and is still\r\nliving at Blackpool.  Of the 18 buried here, one a girl, Ann, having been\r\naccidentally burnt, was a dwarf not only in body, but also in intellect.\r\nAt 23 years of age she was only 26 inches high, and an idiot.  She was\r\nburied July 9, 1844 (note in register).  It is stated that her common way\r\nof showing that she wanted food, was to lick with her tongue the\r\nfire-grate.  It is locally said that at the birth of each of the 18\r\nchildren, a mysterious pigeon appeared, and, in consequence, the child\r\ndied at once, or within a day or two of its appearance.\r\n\r\n{243}  In the ancient house in Boston called “Shodfriars’ Hall,” there\r\nwas established in 1619, a school where 20 boys and 20 girls were taught\r\nto “spin Jersey, or worsted.”  It was called the “Jersey School,” till\r\n1790.
