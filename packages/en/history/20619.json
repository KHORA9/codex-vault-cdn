It was said of him\r\nthat he was greatly beloved by all who served under him.  He was\r\ngenerous, genial and kind hearted, and strictly just in all his practices\r\nand aims.  He gave to his Queen and country a long life of devoted\r\nservice.  His wife, we are told, was a woman of marked liberality;\r\ncheerful and loving, always thoughtful of the wants of others; completely\r\ndevoid of selfishness.\r\n\r\nThe fourth son, and third soldier of this happy pair, Charles George, was\r\nborn at Woolwich in 1833.  He was trained at Taunton.  When about 15\r\nyears of age he was sent to the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, to\r\nprepare for the army; a profession his father thought most worthy of the\r\nGordons.  While here at school an incident occurred which served to show\r\nthat our young hero was no ordinary student.  His tutor, with an air of\r\ncontempt, rebuked him severely for some error or failure in his lessons,\r\nand told him sneeringly he would never make a general.  This roused the\r\nScotch blood of the budding soldier, and in a rage he tore the epaulettes\r\nfrom his shoulders, and threw them at his tutor's feet--another proof of\r\nthe correctness of the old adage, \"Never prophesy unless you know.\"  By\r\nthe time he reached the age of twenty-one, he had become every inch a\r\nsoldier, and when tested he proved to have all a soldier's\r\nqualities--bravery, courage, heroism, patriotism, and fidelity,\r\ncharacteristics of the best soldiers in our army.\r\n\r\nArchibald Forbes, writing of him, says \"The character of General Gordon\r\nwas unique.  As it unfolded in its curiously varied but never\r\ncontradictory aspects, you are reminded of Cromwell, of Havelock, of\r\nLivingstone, and of Captain Hedley Viccars.  But Gordon's individuality\r\nstood out in its incomparable blending of masterfulness and tenderness,\r\nof strength and sweetness.  His high and noble nature was made more\r\nchivalrous by his fervent, deep and real piety.  His absolute trust in\r\nGod guided him serenely through the greatest difficulties.  Because of\r\nthat he was not alone in the deepest solitude.  He was not depressed in\r\nthe direst extremity.  He had learned the happy art of leaning upon the\r\nOmnipotent arm.\"\r\n\r\n{Gordon, the hero: p17.jpg}\r\n\r\nEarly in 1884 a leading newspaper said of him, \"General Gordon is without\r\ndoubt the finest captain of irregular forces living.\"  About the same\r\ntime Mr. Gladstone said of him, \"General Gordon is no common man.  It is\r\nno exaggeration to say he is a hero.  It is no exaggeration to say he is\r\na Christian hero.\"  Mr. W. E. Forster also remarked of him, \"I know no\r\nother man living for whom I have a greater admiration than General\r\nGordon.  He is utterly unselfish.  He is regardless of money.  He cares\r\nnothing for fame or glory.  He cares little for life or death.  He is a\r\ndeeply religious man.  The world to come, and God's government over this,\r\nare to him the greatest of life's realities.  True heroism has been said\r\nto be a sacrifice of self for the benefit of others.  If this is true,\r\nGordon has well won the appellation, \"The Hero of the Soudan.\"  His\r\nsoldierly qualities were first tested in the Crimea, where we find him in\r\n1854 and 1855.  Here for the first time in his military career he was\r\nbrought face to face with all the horrors of actual war, and here for the\r\nfirst time he saw friend and foe lie locked like brothers in each other's\r\narms.  Here he got his first baptism of fire; and here he showed the\r\nsplendid qualities which in after years made him so famous and so\r\nbeloved.  An old soldier who served under him during this terrible\r\ncampaign says \"I shall never forget that remarkable figure and form,\r\nwhich was an inspiration to all who knew him, and saw him on the field of\r\ncarnage and blood.\"\r\n\r\nHe was utterly unconcerned in the midst of dangers and death.  He would\r\ntwirl his cane and good humouredly say \"Now boys, don't fear, I see no\r\ndanger.\"  On one occasion when engaged in the very thick of a most awful\r\nstruggle he said, \"Now my boys, I'm your officer, I lead, you follow,\"\r\nand he walked literally through a shower of lead and iron with as little\r\nconcern apparently, as if he were walking across his own drawing-room;\r\nand he came out of the conflict without a scar.\r\n\r\nSir E. Stanton in his dispatches home, making special reference to our\r\nhero, says--\"Young Gordon has attracted the notice of his superiors out\r\nhere, not only by his activity, but by his special aptitude for war,\r\ndeveloping itself amid the trenches before Sebastopol, in a personal\r\nknowledge of the enemy's movements, such as no officer has displayed.  We\r\nhave sent him frequently right up to the Russian entrenchments to find\r\nout what new moves they are making.\"  Amid all the excitement of war and\r\nits dangers he never omitted writing to his mother; an example I hope my\r\nreaders, if boys, or girls, will studiously copy.  He loved his mother\r\nwith the passion of his great loving heart.  Soldier lads often forget\r\ntheir mother's influence, their mother's prayers, and their mother's God.\r\nWriting home to his mother he says \"We are giving the Redan shells day\r\nand night, in order to prevent the Russians from repairing it and they\r\nrepay us by sending amongst us awful missiles of death and destruction,\r\nand it requires one to be very nimble to keep out of their way.  I have\r\nnow been thirty-four times, twenty-four hours in the trenches; that is\r\nmore than a month without any relief whatever, and I assure you it gets\r\nvery tedious.  Still one does not mind if any advance is being made.\"\r\n\r\nAn eye witness of this bloody work in the trenches and the storming of\r\nthe Malakof and the Redan, writes:--\r\n\r\n   \"On that terrible 8th of September, every gun and mortar that our\r\n   people and our noble allies, the French, could bring to bear upon the\r\n   enemy's work, was raining death and destruction upon them.  The\r\n   stormers had all got into their places.  They consisted of about 1,000\r\n   men of the Old Light and 2nd Division; the supports were formed up as\r\n   closely as possible to them, and all appeared in readiness.  History\r\n   may well say, 'the storming of a fortress is an awful task.'  There we\r\n   stood not a word being spoken; every one seemed to be full of thought;\r\n   many a courageous heart, that was destined to be still in death in one\r\n   short hour, was now beating high.\"\r\n\r\n   \"It was about 11.15 a.m., and our heavy guns were firing in such a way\r\n   as I have never heard before.  The batteries fired in volleys or\r\n   salvoes as fast as they could load and fire, the balls passing a few\r\n   feet above our heads, while the air seemed full of shell.  The enemy\r\n   were not idle; for round shot, shell, grape and musket balls were\r\n   bounding and whizzing all about us, and earth and stones were rattling\r\n   about our heads like hail.  Our poor fellows fell fast, but still our\r\n   sailors and artillery men stuck to it manfully.  We knew well that\r\n   this could not last long, but many a brave soldier's career was cut\r\n   short long before we advanced to the attack--strange some of our older\r\n   hands were smoking and taking not the slightest notice of this 'dance\r\n   of death.'  Some men were being carried past dead, and others limping\r\n   to the rear with mangled limbs, while their life's blood was streaming\r\n   fast away.  We looked at each other with amazement for we were now\r\n   under a most terrible fire.  We knew well it meant death to many of\r\n   us.  Several who had gone through the whole campaign shook hands\r\n   saying, 'This is hot,' 'Good bye, old boy,' 'Write to the old folks\r\n   for me if I do not return.'  This request was made by many of us.  I\r\n   was close to one of our Generals, who stood watch in hand, when\r\n   suddenly at 12 o'clock mid-day the French drums and bugles sounded the\r\n   charge, and with a shout, 'Vive l'Empereur' repeated over and over\r\n   again by some 50,000 men, a shout that was enough to strike terror\r\n   into the enemy.  The French, headed by the Zouaves, sprang forward at\r\n   the Malakof like a lot of cats.  On they went like a lot of bees, or\r\n   rather like the dashing of the waves of the sea against a rock.  We\r\n   had a splendid view of their operations, it was grand but terrible;\r\n   the deafening shouts of the advancing hosts told us they were carrying\r\n   all before them.\"\r\n\r\n   \"They were now completely enveloped in smoke and fire, but column\r\n   after column kept advancing, pouring volley after volley into the\r\n   breasts of the defenders.  They (the French) meant to have it, let the\r\n   cost be what it might.  At 12.15 up went the proud flag of France,\r\n   with a shout that drowned for a time the roar of both cannon and\r\n   musketry.  And now came our turn.  As soon as the French were seen\r\n   upon the Malakof our stormers sprang forward, led by Colonel\r\n   Windham--the old Light Division consisting of 300 men of the 90th,\r\n   about the same number of the 97th, and about 400 of the 2nd Battalion\r\n   Rifle Brigade, and with various detachments of the 2nd and Light\r\n   Divisions, and a number of blue jackets, carrying scaling ladders.  Our\r\n   men advanced splendidly, with a ringing British cheer, although the\r\n   enemy poured a terrible fire of grape, canister and musketry into\r\n   them, which swept down whole companies at a time.  We, the supports,\r\n   moved forward to back up our comrades.  We advanced as quickly as we\r\n   could until we came to the foremost trench, when we leaped the\r\n   parapet, then made a rush at the blood stained walls of the Redan.  We\r\n   had had a clear run of over 200 yards under that murderous fire of\r\n   grape, canister and musketry.  How any ever lived to pass that 200\r\n   yards seemed a miracle; for our poor fellows fell one on the top of\r\n   another; but nothing could stop us but death.  On we went shouting\r\n   until we reached the redoubt.  The fighting inside these works was of\r\n   the most desperate character, butt and bayonet, foot and fist; the\r\n   enemy's guns were quickly spiked: this struggle lasted about an hour\r\n   and a half.  It was an awful time, about 3,000 of our brave soldiers\r\n   were slain in this short period.\"  Our hero Gordon, tells us that on\r\n   the evening of this 8th of September--\r\n\r\n   \"I heard most terrific explosions, the earth seemed to be shaken to\r\n   its very centre;--It was afterwards discovered the enemy's position\r\n   was no longer tenable, so they had fired some 300 tons of gunpowder,\r\n   which had blown up all their vast forts and magazines.  O! what a\r\n   night: many of our poor fellows had been nearly buried in the\r\n   _debris_, and burning mass: the whole of Sebastopol was in flames.  The\r\n   Russians were leaving it helter-skelter--a complete rout, and a heavy\r\n   but gloriously-won victory.\"\r\n\r\nFor his acknowledged ability, his fine heroism, and his true loyalty to\r\nhis superiors during this most trying campaign, he received the\r\nwell-earned decoration of the Legion of Honour from the French\r\nGovernment, a mark of distinction very rarely conferred upon so young an\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\n   \"God gives us men, a time like that demands.\r\n   Strong minds, great hearts, true faith and ready hands;\r\n   Men whom the lusts of office cannot kill,\r\n   Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy,\r\n   Men who possess opinions and a will,\r\n   Men who have honour, men who never lie.\"\r\n\r\nWe must not leave this part of our story without a brief notice of one\r\nwhose name will live in song and story, when this generation shall have\r\npassed away.  Many noble English ladies bravely went out to nurse the\r\nsuffering soldiers; but in this noble band was one whose name remains a\r\nsynonym for kindly sympathy, tenderness and peace--Miss Florence\r\nNightingale.\r\n\r\nThe following lines were written in her praise--\r\n\r\n   \"Britain has welcomed home with open hand\r\n   Her gallant soldiers to their native land;\r\n   But one alone the Nation's thanks did shun,\r\n   Though Europe rings with all that she hath done;\r\n   For when will shadow on the wall e'er fail,\r\n   To picture forth fair Florence Nightingale:\r\n   Her deeds are blazoned on the scroll of fame,\r\n   And England well may prize her deathless name.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The greatness of a nation depends upon the men it can breed and\r\n   rear.--_Froude_.\r\n\r\nThe war over and peace duly established, Lieutenant Gordon (for so he was\r\nthen) accompanied General Sir Lintorn Simmons to Galatz, where, as\r\nassistant commissioner, he was engaged in fixing the new frontiers of\r\nRussia, Turkey and Roumania.  In 1857, when his duties here were\r\nfinished, he went with the same officer to Armenia; there, in the same\r\ncapacity, he was engaged in laying down the Asiatic frontiers of Russia\r\nand Turkey.  When this work was completed he returned home and was\r\nquartered at Chatham, and employed for a time as Field Work Instructor\r\nand Adjutant.  In 1860, now holding the rank of Captain, he joined the\r\nArmy in China, and was present at the surrender of Pekin; and for his\r\nservices he was promoted to the rank of Major.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BURNING OF THE SUMMER PALACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On the eleventh of October,\" Gordon relates, \"we were sent down in a\r\nhurry to throw up earth works against the City; as the Chinese refused to\r\ngive up the gate we demanded their surrender before we could treat with\r\nthem.  They were also required to give up the prisoners.  You will be\r\nsorry to hear the treatment they have suffered has been very bad.  Poor\r\nDe Norman, who was with me in Asia, is one of the victims.  It appears\r\nthey were tied so tight by the wrists that the flesh mortified, and they\r\ndied in the greatest torture.  Up to the time that elapsed before they\r\narrived at the Summer Palace, they were well treated, but then the ill-\r\ntreatment began.  The Emperor is supposed to have been there at the time.\r\n\r\nBut to go back to the work, the Chinese were given until twelve on the\r\n13th, to give up the gate.  We made a lot of batteries, and everything\r\nwas ready for assault of the wall, which is a battlement, forty feet\r\nhigh, but of inferior masonry; at 11.30 p.m., however, the gate was\r\nopened, and we took possession; so our work was of no avail.  The Chinese\r\nhad then, until the 23rd, to think over our terms of treaty, and to pay\r\nup ten thousand pounds (10,000 pounds) for each Englishman, and five\r\nhundred pounds (500 pounds) for each native soldier who had died during\r\ntheir captivity.  This they did, and the money was paid, and the treaty\r\nsigned yesterday.  I could not witness it, as all officers commanding\r\ncompanies were obliged to remain in camp, owing to the ill-treatment the\r\nprisoners experienced at the Summer Palace.  The General ordered this to\r\nbe destroyed, and stuck up proclamations to say why it was ordered.  We\r\naccordingly went out, and after pillaging it, burned the whole\r\nmagnificent palace, and destroyed most valuable property, which could not\r\nbe replaced for millions of pounds.\r\n\r\n\"This Palace\" (wrote the author of _Our Own Times_), \"covered an area of\r\nmany miles.  The Palace of Adrian, at Tivoli, might have been hidden in\r\none of its courts.  Gardens, temples, small lodges and pagodas, groves,\r\ngrottoes, lakes, bridges, terraces, artificial hills, diversified the\r\nvast space.  All the artistic treasures, all the curiosities,\r\narchaeological and other, that Chinese wealth and taste, such as it was,\r\ncould bring together.\"  Gordon notes, \"This palace, with its surrounding\r\nbuildings, over two hundred in number, covered an area eight by ten miles\r\nin extent.\"  He says, \"it makes one's heart burn to see such beauty\r\ndestroyed; it was as if Windsor Palace, South Kensington Museum, and\r\nBritish Museum, all in one, were in flames: you can scarcely imagine the\r\nbeauty and magnificence of the things we were bound to destroy.\"\r\n\r\n\"These palaces were so large, and we were so pressed for time, that we\r\ncould not plunder them carefully.  Quantities of gold ornaments were\r\nburned, considered as brass.  It was wretchedly demoralizing for an army:\r\neverybody was wild for plunder . . .  The throne and room were lined with\r\nebony, carved in a wonderful manner.  There were huge mirrors of all\r\nshapes and sizes, clocks, watches, musical boxes with puppets on them,\r\nmagnificent china of every description, heaps and heaps of silks of all\r\ncolours, coral screens, large amounts of treasures, etc.  The French have\r\nsmashed up everything in a most shameful way.  It was a scene of utter\r\ndestruction which passes my description.\"  This was not much in Gordon's\r\nline.\r\n\r\nIn the following year he made a tour on horseback to the outer wall of\r\nChina at Kalgan, accompanied by Lieutenant Cardew.  A Chinese lad of the\r\nage of fourteen, who knew a little English, acted as their servant and\r\ninterpreter, while their personal luggage was conveyed in the Chinese\r\ncarts.  In the course of this tour we are told they passed through\r\ndistricts which had never before been visited by any European.  At Kalgan\r\nthe great wall was seen, with its parapet about twenty-two feet high, and\r\nsixteen feet broad.  Both sides were solid brick, each being three times\r\nthe size of our English bricks.  Gordon writes: \"It is wonderful to see\r\nthe long line of wall stretching over the hills as far as the eye can\r\nreach.\"  From Kalgan they travelled westwards to Taitong; here they saw\r\nhuge caravans of camels laden with tea going towards Russia.  Here they\r\nwere forced to have the axle trees of their carts widened, for they had\r\ncome into a great part of the country where the wheels were set wider\r\nthan in the provinces whence they came.  Their carts, therefore, no\r\nlonger fitted into the deep ruts which had been worn into the terribly\r\nbad roads.  The main object of their journey was to find out if there was\r\nin the Inner Wall any pass besides the Tchatiaou which on that side of\r\nthe country led from the Russian territory to Pekin.  It was not until\r\nthey reached Taiyuen that they struck the road that led to Pekin or\r\nTientsin.\r\n\r\nTheir first bit of trouble on this somewhat venturesome tour occurred at\r\nTaiyneu; when the bill was brought for their night's entertainment, they\r\nfound it was most exorbitant.  They saw they were likely to have trouble,\r\nso they sent on the carts with luggage and waited at this strange\r\nhostelry till they believed they had got well out of the way.  Then they\r\noffered what they believed was a reasonable amount in payment of their\r\nbill.  It was refused.  They then tried to mount their horses but the\r\npeople at the Inn stopped them.  Major Gordon hereupon drew his revolver\r\nmore for show than for use, for he allowed them to take it from him.  He\r\nthen said, \"Let us go to the Mandarin's house.\"  To this consent was\r\ngiven, and the two wide-awake English officers walked alongside their\r\nhorses.  On the way Gordon said to his companion \"are you ready to\r\nmount?\"  \"Yes\" he replied.  So they mounted quietly, and went on with the\r\npeople.  When they reached the Mandarin's, they turned their horses and\r\ngalloped off after their carts as fast as they could, having paid what\r\nthey believed a reasonable amount for expenses.  The people yelled and\r\nrushed after them, but it was too late.  Some distance from the place\r\nwhere they had spent the night they came upon the pass over the mountains\r\nwhich led down into the country, drained by the great Peiho river.  \"The\r\ndescent\" says Gordon, \"was terrible, and the cold so intense that raw\r\neggs were frozen as hard as if they had been boiled half an hour.\"  To\r\nadd to their troubles, the carts they had sent on in front had been\r\nattacked by robbers.  They, however, with many difficulties managed to\r\nreach Tientsin in safety; their leave of absence had been exceeded by\r\nabout fourteen days.  In 1862 Major Gordon left for Shanghai under the\r\norders of Sir Charles Staveley who had been appointed to the command of\r\nthe English forces in China.  At the very time that England and France\r\nwere at war with China, a terrible and far reaching rebellion was laying\r\nwaste whole provinces.  An article in our London _Daily News_ about this\r\ndate said, \"But for Gordon the whole Continent of China might have been a\r\nscene of utter and hopeless ruin and devastation.\"  At the date he took\r\ncharge of the \"ever victorious army,\" China was in a state of widespread\r\nanarchy and confusion.\r\n\r\nThis rebellion which Gordon was here authorized to suppress was called\r\n\"The Tai-ping rebellion.\"  Its rise was brought about by a strange\r\nmixture of incredulity and fanaticism, caused by some European Christian\r\ngiving away his literature.  A village demagogue named Hung-tsne-Shuen\r\ncaught the idea, after reading the papers referred to, that he was\r\ninspired; that he was God, King, Emperor, and that he ought to rule; so,\r\npuffed up with pride and insatiable ambition, he began raising an army;\r\nand aimed at nothing less than the usurpation of the \"Dragon Throne.\"\r\nSome thought him mad; but he gathered about him some 20,000 men whom he\r\nhad influenced to believe in him as the \"Second Celestial Brother,\" and\r\ngave out he was a seer of visions, a prophet of vengeance and freedom; a\r\nchampion of the poor and oppressed; and many were mad enough to believe\r\nhim, and thus he raised an army which grew in strength until it reached\r\nsome hundreds of thousands strong; he then proclaimed himself the\r\nHeavenly King, The Emperor of the great place; and then with five wangs\r\nor warrior kings, chosen from amongst his kinsmen, he marched through\r\nChina, devastating the country, and increasing his army in his progress.\r\n\r\nThe most populous, and until now wealthy provinces were soon in his\r\nhands.  The silk factories were silent; the Cities were falling into\r\nutter and hopeless desolation: rebellion, war and famine, raged and\r\nreigned supreme.  Gordon made them pause!  His marvellous power of\r\norganizing and leading men, a power derived from an inflexible,\r\ndetermined, fearless, and deeply religious temperament, influenced the\r\nChinese character quickly and powerfully.  His very name soon became a\r\nterror to the banded brigands and to all evil doers.  An Englishman in\r\nChina at the time wrote home and said \"The destiny of China is in the\r\nhands of Major Gordon, and if he remains at his post the question will\r\nsoon be settled, and peace and quiet will be restored to this\r\nunfortunate, but sorely tried country.\"\r\n\r\nIn all the strange and trying experiences of this Chinese Campaign Gordon\r\nbore himself with a bravery and courage seldom equalled, we think never\r\nsurpassed.\r\n\r\nDr. Guthrie once said, \"It is very remarkable, and highly creditable to\r\nthe loyalty and bravery of our British soldiers, that, notwithstanding\r\nall the wars in which they have been engaged, no foreign nation to-day\r\nflaunts a British flag as a trophy of its victory and of our defeat.  Nor\r\nin the proud pillar raised by the great Napoleon in commemoration of his\r\nmany victories--a pillar made of the cannons taken by him in battles, is\r\nthere an ounce of metal that belongs to a British gun.\"  The\r\ncharacteristics of the bravest of our British soldiers were pre-eminently\r\ndisplayed in Gordon.  For--\r\n\r\n   \"He holds no party with unmanly fears,\r\n   Where duty points he confidently steers:\r\n   Faces a thousand dangers at her call,\r\n   And trusting in his God surmounts them all.\"\r\n\r\nHis soldierly qualities were very often put to the test in this strange\r\nland.  Hung, the leader of this rebellion, had become so popular and made\r\nsuch marvellous progress that when Gordon had organized his ever\r\nvictorious army, Hung had captured Nanking, one of the principal cities,\r\nand made this his capital; and here, under the very shadow of the Chinese\r\nmetropolis, he established himself in royal state.  His followers were\r\nheld together by the force of his religious tenets; they believed in him\r\nas the Lord from Heaven, who would save the suffering minds and give them\r\na celestial reward.  A missionary who was in Nanking, Rev. J. L. Holmes,\r\ngives his impressions of this warlike devotee.  \"At night (he says) we\r\nwitnessed their worship.  It occurred at the beginning of their sabbath,\r\nmidnight on Friday.  The place of worship was the Chung-Wang's private\r\naudience room.  He was himself seated in the midst of his attendants, no\r\nfemales were present.  They first sang, or rather chanted; after which a\r\nwritten prayer was read, then burned by an officer; then they rose and\r\nsang again, then separated.  The Chung-wang sent for me before he left\r\nhis seat, and asked me if I understood their mode of worship.  I replied\r\nI had just seen it for the first time.  He explained that the Tien-wang\r\nhad been to the celestial world and had seen the Great God and obtained a\r\nrevelation! &c. . . .  As the day dawned we started for the Palace of the\r\nTien-wang.  The procession was headed by a number of brilliantly coloured\r\nbanners, after which followed a troop of armed soldiers; then came the\r\nChung-wang in a large sedan, covered with yellow satin and embroidery,\r\nand borne by eight coolies.  Music of a peculiar kind added to the scene,\r\nas the curious sightseers lined the streets on either side, who probably\r\nnever saw such a sight before.  Reaching the \"Morning Palace,\" we were\r\npresented to the Tsau-wang and his son with several others including the\r\nTien-wang's two brothers, who were seated in a deep recess over the\r\nentrance of which was written \"Illustrious Heavenly Door.\"  In another\r\nplace was \"Holy Heavenly Gate,\" from which a boy of about fourteen made\r\nhis appearance and took his place with the royal group; then they\r\nproceeded with their religious ceremonies again: this time kneeling with\r\ntheir faces to the Tien-wang's seat.  Then they sang in a standing\r\nposition.  A roast pig and the body of a goat were lying with other\r\narticles on tables in the outer court, and a fire was kept burning on a\r\nstone altar in the front of the Tien-wang's seat.  Afterwards, says the\r\nmissionary, I was led through a number of rooms and courts to see Chung-\r\nwang privately.  I was brought into one of his private sitting-rooms,\r\nwhere he sat clothed loosely in white silk, with a red kerchief round his\r\nhead, and a jewel in front.  He was seated in an easy chair, and fanned\r\nby a pretty slipshod girl.  He asked me to a seat beside him and\r\nquestioned me about a map he had seen with parallel lines running each\r\nway, said to have been made by foreigners, asked me to explain what it\r\nwas.  He also showed me a musical-box and a spy-glass, asking many\r\nquestions.  From all I could learn by my visit to this pretender there\r\nwas nothing in their religion to elevate, but everything to degrade.  With\r\nthem to rob and murder were virtuous deeds.  \"Slay the imps\" was their\r\nwatchword.  Gordon found in this fanatic a foe of no mean order.  But he\r\nsoon found too that courage and faith in God had done and would still\r\nlead to victory.  In a letter home he says--\"I am afraid you will be much\r\nvexed at my having taken the command of the Sung-kiang force, and that I\r\nam now a mandarin.  I have taken the step on consideration.  I think that\r\nany one who contributes to putting down this rebellion fulfils a human\r\ntask, and also tends a great deal to open China to civilization.  I will\r\nnot act rashly, and I trust to be able soon to return to England; at the\r\nsame time I will remember your and my father's wishes, and endeavour to\r\nremain as short a time as possible.  I can say that if I had not accepted\r\nthe command I believe the force would have been broken up and the\r\nrebellion gone on in its misery for years.  I trust this will not now be\r\nthe case, and that I may soon be able to comfort you on this subject.  You\r\nmust not fret about me, I think I am doing a good service . . .  I keep\r\nyour likeness before me, and can assure you and my father that I will not\r\nbe rash, and that as soon as I can conveniently, and with due regard to\r\nthe object I have in view, I will come home.\"\r\n\r\nGordon had hardly yet realized the difficulties and dangers which beset\r\nhim.  His troops were undisciplined and largely composed of all\r\nnationalities.  Men bent on plunder, and exceedingly numerous; about\r\n120,000 men.  Gordon's appointment as Chief in Command of the \"Ever\r\nVictorious Army\" proved to be a wise and good one for China.\r\n\r\nColonel Chesney thus writes:--\"If General Staveley had made a mistake in\r\nthe operations he personally conducted the year before, he more than\r\nredeemed it by the excellence of his choice of Gordon.  This strange army\r\nwas made up of French, Germans, Americans, Spaniards, some of good and\r\nsome of bad character, but in their chief they had one whose courage they\r\nwere bound to admire, and whose justice they could not help but admit.\r\nThe private plundering of vanquished towns and cities allowed under their\r\nformer chief, disappeared under the eye of a leader whose eye was as\r\nkeen, as his soul was free from the love of filthy lucre.  They, however,\r\nlearned to respect and love a general in whose kindness, valour, skill,\r\nand justice they found cause unhesitatingly to confide; who never spared\r\nhimself personal exposure when danger was near.  In every engagement, and\r\nthese numbered more than seventy, he was to the front and led in person.\r\nHis somewhat undisciplined army, had in it many brave men; but even such\r\nmen were very reluctant at times to face these desperate odds.  Whenever\r\nthey showed signs of vacillation he would take one of the men by the arm,\r\nand lead him into the very thick of the fight.  He always went unarmed\r\neven when foremost in the breach.  He never saw danger.  A shower of\r\nbullets was no more to him than a shower of hailstones; he carried one\r\nweapon only, and that was a little cane, which won for itself the name of\r\n\"Gordon's magic wand.\"  On one occasion when leading a storming party his\r\nmen wavered under a most withering fire.  Gordon coolly turned round and\r\nwaving his cane, bade his men follow him.  The soldiers inspired by his\r\ncourage, followed with a tremendous rush and shout, and at once grandly\r\ncarried the position.  After the capture of one of the Cities, Gordon was\r\nfirm in not allowing them to pillage, sack and burn such places; and for\r\nthis some of his men showed a spirit of insubordination.  His artillery\r\nmen refused to fall in when ordered; nay more, they threatened to turn\r\nupon him their guns and blow him and his officers to pieces.  This news\r\nwas conveyed to him by a written declaration.  His keen eye saw through\r\ntheir scheme at a glance, and with that quiet determination which was his\r\npeculiar strength, he summoned them into his presence and with a firmness\r\nborn of courage and faith in God, he declared that unless the ringleader\r\nof this movement was given up, one out of every five would be shot!  At\r\nthe same time he stepped to the front and with his own hand seized one of\r\nthe most suspicious looking of the men, dragged him out, and ordered him\r\nto be shot on the spot at once, the order was instantly carried out by an\r\nofficer.  After this he gave them half an hour to reconsider their\r\nposition at the end of which he found them ready to carry out any order\r\nhe might give.  It transpired afterwards that the man who was shot was\r\nthe ringleader in this insubordination.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Gordon had broken the neck of this far-reaching and disastrous\r\nrebellion, and had restored to the Emperor of China the principal cities\r\nand towns in peace, the London _Times_ wrote of him:--\"Never did a\r\nsoldier of fortune deport himself with a nicer sense of military honour,\r\nwith more gallantry against the resisting, with more mercy towards the\r\nvanquished, with more disinterested neglect of opportunities of personal\r\nadvantage, or with more entire devotion to the objects and desires of the\r\nGovernment he served, than this officer, who, after all his splendid\r\nvictories, has just laid down his sword.\"\r\n\r\nBefore leaving China he was offered a very large reward in cash, as it\r\nwas acknowledged on all hands he had saved the Empire more than 5,000,000\r\npounds sterling.  All money he refused; he, however, asked that some of\r\nit might be given to the troops, who had served him on the whole with\r\ngreat loyalty, and this was granted.  A gold medal was struck in honour\r\nof his marvellous achievements, and this he accepted and brought home;\r\nbut it was soon missing.  He thought more of the starving poor than of\r\nany medal; so he sold it, and sent the cash it realized to the Lancashire\r\nCotton Operatives, who were then literally starving.  The Imperial Decree\r\nof China conferred upon him the rank of \"Ti-tu,\" the very highest honour\r\never conferred upon a Chinese subject.  Also the \"Peacock's feather,\"\r\n\"The Order of the Star,\" and the \"Yellow Jacket.\"  By these he was\r\nconstituted one of the \"Emperor's Body Guard.\"  In a letter home he says,\r\n\"I shall leave China as poor as I entered it, but with the knowledge that\r\nthrough my weak instrumentality from eighty to one hundred thousand lives\r\nhave been saved.  Than this I covet no greater satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\nBefore he left China, as a proof of the estimation in which he was held,\r\na grand illuminated address was presented to him, signed by more than\r\nsixty of the leading firms of the Empire, and by most of the bankers and\r\nmerchants of the cities of Pekin, Shanghai, and of the principal towns\r\nthroughout China.\r\n\r\nIt read thus:--\"Honoured Sir,--On the eve of your departure to your\r\nnative country, we, the undersigned, mostly fellow-countrymen of your\r\nown, but also representing other nationalities, desire to express to you\r\nour earnest wish for a successful voyage and happy return to your friends\r\nand the land of your birth.\r\n\r\n\"Your career during your stay amongst us has been, so far as we know,\r\nwithout a parallel in the history of foreign nations with China; and we\r\nfeel that we should be alike wanting towards you and towards ourselves,\r\nwere we to pass by this opportunity without expressing our appreciation\r\nand admiration of the line of conduct which you personally have pursued.\r\nIn a position of unequalled difficulty, and surrounded by complications\r\nof every conceivable nature, you have succeeded in offering to the eyes\r\nof the Chinese Empire, no less by your loyal and thoroughly disinterested\r\nline of action than by your conspicuous gallantry and talent for\r\norganization and command, the example of a foreign officer, serving the\r\ngovernment of this country, with honourable fidelity and undeviating self-\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n{Chinese Gordon: p45.jpg}\r\n\r\n\"Once more wishing you a prosperous voyage, and a long career of\r\nusefulness and success.\"\r\n\r\nSigned, &c.\r\n\r\nThere is truth in this as applied to Gordon:--\r\n\r\n   \"He strove not for the wealth of fame,\r\n   From heaven the power that moved him came.\r\n   And welcome as the mountain air,\r\n   The voice that bid him do and dare.\r\n   Onward he bore and battled still\r\n   With a most firm enduring will,\r\n   His only hope to win the prize\r\n   Laid up for him beyond the skies.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor wished the British Minister to bring before the notice of Her\r\nMajesty the Queen of England his appreciation of the splendid services\r\nwhich Gordon had rendered.  He hoped that he would be rewarded in England\r\nas well as in China for his heroic achievements.\r\n\r\nA subsequent letter in the _Times_ said that Prince Kung, who was then\r\nthe Regent of China, had waited upon Sir Frederick Bruce, and said to\r\nhim, \"You will be astonished to see me again, but I felt I could not\r\nallow you to leave without coming to see you about Gordon.  We do not\r\nknow what to do.  He will not receive money from us, and we have already\r\ngiven him every honour which it is in the power of the Emperor to bestow;\r\nbut as these are of little value in his eyes, I have brought you this\r\nletter, and I ask you to give it to the Queen of England that she may\r\nbestow on him some reward which would be more valuable in his eyes.\"\r\n\r\nSir Frederick Bruce sent this to London with a letter of his own:--\"I\r\nenclose translation of a despatch from Prince Kung, containing the decree\r\npublished by the Emperor, acknowledging the services of Gordon and\r\nrequesting that Her Majesty's Government be pleased to recognise him.\r\nGordon well deserves the favours of your Majesty for the skill and\r\ncourage he has shown, his disinterestedness has elevated our national\r\ncharacter in the eyes of the Chinese.  Not only has he refused any\r\npecuniary reward, but he has spent more than his pay in contributing to\r\nthe comforts of the officers who served under him, and in assuaging the\r\ndistress of the starving population whom he relieved from the yoke of\r\ntheir oppressors.\"\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that this letter was ever sent to the Queen, or\r\nnoticed by the Government, and so the heroic deeds of a man of whom any\r\nnation might justly be proud, were forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"We are to relieve the distressed, to put the wanderer into his way,\r\n   and to share our bread with the hungry, which is but the doing good to\r\n   others.\"--SENECA.\r\n\r\nOur hero having returned to his native land, and to settle for a little\r\nwhile at the quiet town of Gravesend, refused to be lionized, and he\r\nbegged that no publication of his deeds of daring and devotion in China,\r\nshould be recorded.  His quiet life here as an engineer was not less\r\nremarkable, though of a different kind, than life in China had been.\r\nHere, however, he spent the energies of his spare time, to the services\r\nof the poor.  At this juncture I was privileged to come in contact with\r\nthis remarkable man, in the great city of Manchester, where for a few\r\nmonths, he was employed on some Governmental Commission.  Like his Master\r\nChrist--he went about doing good.  My position at this time was an agent,\r\nor scripture reader for \"The Manchester City Mission.\"  Gordon found his\r\nway to the office and saw the chairman of the mission, and from him got\r\npermission to accompany one of the missioners round his district.  He\r\nexpressed his desire to go round one of the poorest districts of the\r\ncity; as it might afford him an opportunity of seeing for himself some of\r\nthe social blots and scars in our national life; also of giving some\r\npractical help to the deserving poor.  My district was such an one as\r\nwould furnish him with the opportunities to satisfy him in that\r\nparticular, and I was therefore asked to allow Col. Gordon to accompany\r\nme to its squalid scenes, to my Ragged School, cottage and open-air\r\nservices, and to the sick and suffering, of which I had many on my list.\r\nThis request was gladly complied with; for the first sight of the\r\nstranger made me love and trust him.\r\n\r\nAnd now the hero of so many battles fought for freedom and liberty, was\r\nto witness scenes of warfare of a very different kind.  War, it is true,\r\nbut not where there are garments rolled in blood and victims slain; but\r\nwar with the powers of darkness, war between good and evil, truth and\r\nerror, light and darkness.  We went together into the lowest slums of the\r\ndistrict; walked arm in arm over the ground where misery tells its sad\r\nand awful tale, where poverty shelters its shivering frame, and where\r\nblasphemy howls its curse.  We found out haunts of vice and sin, terrible\r\nin their character, and distressing in their consequences.  I found he\r\nhad not hitherto been accustomed to this kind of mission.  Once on my\r\nentering a den of dangerous characters and lecturing them on their sinful\r\ncourse and warning them in unmistakable words of the consequences, he\r\nafterwards said: \"I could not have found courage of the kind you show in\r\nthis work; yet I never was considered lacking in courage on the field of\r\nbattle.  When in the Crimea, I was sent frequently and went on hands and\r\nknees through the fall of shells and the whizz of bullets right up to the\r\nRussian walls to watch their movements, and I never felt afraid; I\r\nconfess I need courage to warn men of sin and its dangerous\r\nconsequences.\"  He met me, for a time almost daily, well supplied with\r\ntracts, which I noticed he used as a text for a few words of advice, or\r\ncomfort, or warning as the case required, but he invariably left a silver\r\ncoin between the leaves; this I think was a proof he was sincere in his\r\nefforts to do good.  Along Old Millgate, and around the Cathedral, at\r\nthat time, were numerous courts and alleys, obscure, often filthy, dark\r\nand dangerous; down or up these he accompanied me; up old rickety\r\nstaircases, into old crumbling ruins of garrets he followed without\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\n{C. G. Gordon: p51.jpg}\r\n\r\nAt the bedside of the dying prodigal or prostitute he would sit with\r\nintense interest, pointing them to Him who casts out none.  In our house\r\nto house visitation he would sit down and read of the Saviour's love,\r\nmaking special reference to those that are poor in this world, assuring\r\nthem it was for the outcast and the forsaken, and the lost, that Jesus\r\ncame to die.  He would kneel down for prayer by a broken chair or the\r\ncorner of a slop-stone, or by the wash-tub, and with the simplicity of a\r\nchild, address in tender and touching petition, the Great Father of all\r\nin Heaven, while tears chased each other down his sun-tanned face; his\r\ngreat soul going out with his prayer for Heaven's blessing on the\r\nhelpless poor.\r\n\r\nHis sympathy was tender as a child's, and his beneficence as liberal as\r\nthe best of Christian's can be.  He often came and took tea with me in my\r\nquiet home, where we had many very interesting interviews, and where we\r\nconversed on subjects varied but mostly religious; he rarely referred to\r\nhis military achievements; when he did so it was with the greatest self\r\nabnegation and humility.  He would say, \"No honour belongs to me, I am\r\nonly the instrument God uses to accomplish his purpose.\"  I introduced\r\nhim to my ragged school; this to him was a most interesting scene of\r\nwork, and he volunteered to give us some of his time and service; and to\r\nsee him with 20 or 30 of these ragged lads about him was to say the\r\nleast, full of interest.  He, however, had the happy art of getting at\r\ntheir heart at once; by incidents, stories and experiences, which\r\ncompelled attention and confidence.  In a very short time he won the\r\nesteem and the love of every lad in the school.  To some of these lads he\r\nbecame specially attached, and for some time after he left Manchester he\r\nkept up with me, and with several of the lads, also with some of my\r\ncolleagues on the mission--a very interesting correspondence.  Happily, I\r\nhave preserved a good number of these letters, and they show the spirit\r\nand motive of that noble soul, more than any poor words of mine can do.\r\n\r\n   Letter.\r\n\r\n   GRAVESEND,\r\n   _June 19th_, _1869_.\r\n\r\n   \"My Dear Mr. Wardle.--My long silence has not been because I had\r\n   forgot you and your kind reception of me; but because secular work has\r\n   so completely taken up my time of late.  I was glad to hear of you . .\r\n   . . and of the Dark Lane (ragged school) lads.  I often wish I could\r\n   go down with you and see them; I often think of them.  I wish I could\r\n   help them, but it is only by prayer that I can now benefit them.  I\r\n   loved them very much, and look forward to the time when our weary\r\n   march, dogged by our great foe will be ended; and we meet for ever in\r\n   our Heavenly home.  I remember them all, Jones, Carr, &c., &c., and I\r\n   often think of their poor young faces which must soon get deepened\r\n   into wrinkles with sorrow and care.  Thank God we go like Israel of\r\n   old, after a new home; we cannot find our rest here!  Day by day we\r\n   are, little as we may think it, a day's march nearer, till someday we\r\n   shall perhaps unexpectedly reach it.\"\r\n\r\n   Good bye, my dear Mr. Wardle,\r\n   Yours sincerely,\r\n   C. H. GORDON.\r\n\r\n      \"Kind regards to _my_ lads.\"\r\n\r\nGordon was deeply moved by the sights of poverty and distress around him;\r\nthis was shown by the dress and appearance of the factory hands.  He was\r\nespecially struck by the clatter of the clogs--the Lancashire cotton\r\noperative's foot gear.\r\n\r\nTo his Sister he wrote:--\r\n\r\n   MANCHESTER,\r\n   _September 21st_, _1867_.\r\n\r\n   \"Your heart would bleed to see the poor people, though they say there\r\n   is no distress such as there was some time ago; they are indeed like\r\n   sheep having no shepherd, but, thank God, though they look forlorn,\r\n   they have a watchful and pitying eye upon them.  It does so painfully\r\n   affect me, and I do trust will make me think less of self, and more of\r\n   these poor people.  Little idea have the rich of other countries of\r\n   the scenes in these parts.  It does so make me long for that great day\r\n   when He will come and put all things straight.\r\n\r\n   How long, O Lord, how long!\r\n\r\n   I have but little time to write by this post, so will say no more\r\n   about that.  I have less confidence in the flesh than ever, thank God,\r\n   though it is a painful struggle and makes one long for the time when,\r\n   this our earthly tabernacle, shall be dissolved; but may His will be\r\n   done.  If there is sin and misery, there is One who over-rules all\r\n   things for good; we must be patient.  The poor scuttlers here, male\r\n   and female, fill me with sorrow.  They wear wooden clogs, a sort of\r\n   sabot, and make such a noise.  Good-bye, and may God manifest Himself\r\n   in all His power to all of you, and make you to rejoice with joy\r\n   unspeakable.  If we think of it, the only thing which makes the\r\n   religion of our Lord Jesus Christ differ from that of every other\r\n   religion, or profession, is this very indwelling of God the Holy Ghost\r\n   in our bodies; we can do nothing good; Christ says, \"Without me, ye\r\n   can do nothing.\"  You are dead in trespasses and sins, you are\r\n   corpses, and must have life put in you, and that life is God Himself,\r\n   who dwells in us, and shows us the things of Christ.\"\r\n\r\n   C.

We are\r\n   only witnesses, not judges; the Gospel is:--God loves you: not--Do you\r\n   love God.  The one is a witness, the other an inquiry which is not to\r\n   be made by man of his fellow man, for it is impossible for man to love\r\n   God unless he first feels and knows that God loves him.

John, chap. 4, ver.\r\n15--\"Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth\r\nin him, and he in God.\"  This he took as a text for a little homily which\r\nhe printed and circulated by thousands.  After the above head-line, in\r\nspecial type, it ran thus:--\"Reader!  Do you confess that Jesus is the\r\nSon of God?  Do you believe in your heart that Jesus is the Son of God?\r\nIf you do then God dwells in you to-day.  Whatever you are, whatever you\r\nhave been, or have done,--and if you ask Him, 'O Lord, I believe that\r\nJesus is the Son of God; show me, for His sake, that Thou livest in me.'\r\nHe will make you feel His presence in your hearts, and will make you feel\r\nperfectly happy, which you cannot be in any other way.  Many believe\r\nsincerely that Jesus is the Son of God, but are not happy, because they\r\ndo not believe THAT which God tells them--that He lives in them both in\r\nbody and soul, transforming the whole man into the likeness of Jesus\r\nChrist, if they confess Jesus to be His son.  Do you believe this\r\nstatement?  If you do, yet do not feel God's presence, ask Him to show\r\nHimself to you, and He will surely do so.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this homily, on the same tract, were the following passages of\r\nScripture:--\r\n\r\n   Luke, chap. 2, v. 13.  \"If ye then being evil, know how to give good\r\n   gifts to your children; how much more shall your heavenly Father give\r\n   the Holy Spirit to them that ask.\"\r\n\r\n   Rom., chap. 10, v. 9.  \"If thou shall confess with thy mouth the Lord\r\n   Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from\r\n   the dead, thou shalt be saved.\"\r\n\r\n   I. Cor., chap. 3, v. 16.  \"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God,\r\n   and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you.\"\r\n\r\n   I. Cor., chap. 6, v. 19.  \"Know ye not that your body is the temple of\r\n   the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not\r\n   your own.\"\r\n\r\n   II. Cor., chap. 6, v. 16.  \"Ye are the temple of the living God; as\r\n   God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be\r\n   their God, and they shall be my people.\"\r\n\r\nThe tone and spirit of this tract, is the kernel, if I may say so, of his\r\ndeepest religious convictions.\r\n\r\nHe gave me a number of New Testaments for distribution, as he did also to\r\none or two others of our missioners.  The following letter accompanies\r\nthe parcel:--\r\n\r\n   \"My dear Mr. Wardle,--I have sent thirty Testaments for you and thirty\r\n   for Mr. Fielden.  Will you kindly oblige by marking in each the\r\n   following passages, viz.:--\r\n\r\n   Matt. chap. 2, V. 28, 29.  \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are\r\n   heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\"\r\n\r\n   \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in\r\n   heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\"\r\n\r\n   Gal. ch. 5, v., 19., 25.  \"Now the works of the flesh are manifest,\r\n   which are these: adultery, fornication, uncleanliness, lasciviousness,\r\n   idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife,\r\n   seditions, heresies, 21.  Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings,\r\n   and such like; of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you\r\n   in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the\r\n   Kingdom of God.\"  22.  But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,\r\n   peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 23.  Meekness,\r\n   temperance; against such there is no law.  42.  And they that are\r\n   Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.  If\r\n   we live in the spirit, let us walk in the spirit.\"\r\n\r\n   Also I John ch. 4, v. 15.  \"Whosoever shall confess, etc.\"\r\n\r\nHe also published a little work entitled \"Christ and His members; or the\r\nin-dwelling of God, the root of faith in Christ.\"  One or two quotations\r\nmay be sufficient to show the nature or scope of the work, a copy now\r\nlies before me.\r\n\r\n\"Belief or faith in Jesus being the Son of God, is the distinguishing\r\nspiritual mark of the members of Christ's body; it is a fruit which\r\nsprings from a root, or source, from which it is sustained, and\r\nincreased.  This root is the indwelling of God the Holy Ghost in the\r\nsoul.  This indwelling gives faith or belief in the fact that even as the\r\nsun gives light, or the fire gives warmth, and as there can be no warmth\r\nwithout fire, and no light without the sun, neither can there be any\r\nbelief in Jesus, without the indwelling of God in the soul.\"\r\n\r\nHe wrote me from Liverpool as follows:\r\n\r\n   \"My dear Mr. Wardle, do not forget to take the Testaments on Tuesday\r\n   night.  I always carry some with me, and always regret if I am taken\r\n   by surprise, and have not any.\r\n\r\n   Read and delight in \"The tongue of fire,\" especially the first four or\r\n   five chapters.  If a man would be the instrument of winning souls to\r\n   his Lord, it is utterly impossible for him to do so except through and\r\n   by the Holy Ghost.  He must be loving the praise of God, more than\r\n   that of man.  He must be humble, mean spirited it is called by many;\r\n   even sometimes by his friends: and he can only be mean spirited by\r\n   living near God.  Let a man live distant from God, who is light, and\r\n   he will not think he is so bad, but will think himself a little better\r\n   than others, but let him live near God, and as he lives near Him he\r\n   will feel himself worse than the worst; such is the power of the\r\n   glorious light . . . .  Goodbye; kind regards to all.\r\n\r\n   Yours sincerely, C. G. GORDON.\"\r\n\r\nAnother letter from Gravesend.\r\n\r\n   Nov. 24, 1868.\r\n\r\n   \"My dear Mr. Wardle, I thank you for your kind note.  I send you 500\r\n   leaflets, kindly give them to the boys and girls of Buxton.  The\r\n   servant forgot to pay the carriage, so I send a small sum which I hope\r\n   will cover it.  I hear now and then of the Dark Lane Ragged School,\r\n   from Mr. James Johnson, who kindly writes now and then.  I will write\r\n   (D.V.) again shortly.  Kind regards.\r\n\r\n   Yours sincerely\r\n   C. G. GORDON.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he writes from Gravesend.\r\n\r\n   \"My Dear Mr. Wardle, I hope you have not forgotten me, for I have not\r\n   done so to you, but I am sure you are very busy, and hard worked . . .\r\n   .  Will you thank Fielden for his kind note and remember me to his\r\n   wife and brother.  Tell him I was very glad to hear of two of my boys,\r\n   English and Hogg.\r\n\r\n   I often would like to look in and see you and the lads at _Dark Lane_,\r\n   {63} and all my poor old sick folk I used to visit.  Remember me to\r\n   them all.\r\n\r\n   I do not see my way to come down yet awhile, for we have all our leave\r\n   stopped.  Excuse me for I have my hands full of work.  Believe me, my\r\n   dear Mr. Wardle.\r\n\r\n   Yours sincerely\r\n   C. G. GORDON.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"In the love of a brave and faithful man, there is always a strain of\r\n   maternal tenderness; he gives out again those beams of protecting\r\n   fondness, which were shed on him as he lay upon his mother's\r\n   knee.\"--GEO. ELLIOTT.\r\n\r\nA son of one of our missionaries (J. Johnson) says of Gordon \"he was one\r\nof the most unassuming and gentle men I ever met; and I well remember his\r\nsaintly conversation, as he sat at tea with us.  I also remember, (though\r\nonly a youth) being struck with his humility, especially for one of his\r\nrank and profession.  He generally had on a well worn greyish overcoat,\r\nthe side pockets of which gaped somewhat with constant usage for into\r\nthem he would cram a large number of tracts and sally forth in company\r\nwith me or another of the missionaries, or as sometimes happened he went\r\nalone, drop a tract here or there and speak a seasonable word.  He spoke\r\nto me as a youth, as some of our saintly old pastors used to do to the\r\nchildren of the penniless where they stayed.  He wrote me occasionally.  A\r\nspecimen I herewith append.\"\r\n\r\nLetter to Mr. Johnson, junr.:\r\n\r\n   \"My dear J. . . . since we had a few words together you have not been\r\n   out of my mind for any length of time together, and I was very glad to\r\n   hear of you to-day from your father.  God acts in mysterious ways and\r\n   He gave me comfort concerning you on that evening.  Trust Him with all\r\n   thine heart.  He says (He who cannot lie) He lives in you if you\r\n   believe that Jesus is the Son of God.  His word is truth whatever may\r\n   be our feelings, which change as the clouds.  You are my dear friend,\r\n   saved not on account of your feelings, but because our blessed Lord\r\n   loved you unto death, and has washed you in His own blood . . . .  I\r\n   will not write more than express my hope that He who has begun a good\r\n   work may perfect it.  Yea he surely will, for He says He will perfect\r\n   that which concerneth us--make you useful in His service.  May He\r\n   strengthen you to fight the good fight of faith, and give you that\r\n   crown of glory which fadeth not away; I am very sure He will.  May His\r\n   will be done on this poor sorrowing world, for the longer we live the\r\n   more fleeting are its glories.  Good-bye, my dear young friend.\r\n   Believe me\r\n\r\n   Yours sincerely\r\n   C. G. GORDON.\"\r\n\r\nAlso a further letter to Mr. Johnson.  This was written during my illness\r\nand leave of absence from duty--\r\n\r\n   \"My dear Mr. Johnson, I have received your letter with many thanks.  I\r\n   am so much obliged for your letting me know of MY LADS, and have\r\n   written to them a few lines.  I wish sometimes I was with you.  I like\r\n   your quiet earnestness; there is little of that here, and I like the\r\n   work; I have also said a few words to your son; the Holy Ghost is the\r\n   teacher for Him, and will not leave His work till he is happy.\r\n\r\n   I hope Mr. Wardle is improving in health.  \"And he shall sit as a\r\n   refiner and purifier of silver.\"  Silver is spoilt if heated too much,\r\n   therefore the refiner sits watching; until it is purified when the\r\n   refiner sees his image reflected in its surface; so with us, our Lord\r\n   will see that we are not too much heated, only just enough to reflect\r\n   His image.  Will you thank Mr. Fielden for his kind letter, I quite\r\n   feel for his trials in that district, but he has a fellow helper and\r\n   worker in his kind Lord who feels for him and will support him through\r\n   all.  Give my kind regard to Spence, your wife and son, and to all my\r\n   friends.\r\n\r\n   And believe me my dear Mr. Johnson,\r\n\r\n   Yours sincerely,\r\n   C. G. GORDON.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson writes:--\r\n\r\n   \"One evening after I had been observing his patient endurance and\r\n   perseverance with one of the reckless, insolent lads as we left the\r\n   school, I, in a quiet pleasant way remarked \"I fear Colonel, your\r\n   Christian work in Dark Lane Ragged School will never get the fame and\r\n   applause from this world that your military achievements in China have\r\n   lately secured for you.\"\r\n\r\n   \"My dear Sir,\" he replied \"If I can but be the means in the hands of\r\n   God of leading any of these precious sons to Jesus, I must place that\r\n   amongst the most glorious trophies of my life, and to hear the Master\r\n   at last say 'Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these,\r\n   ye have done it unto Me,' will be to me a resplendent undying glory\r\n   when so many of earth's fleeting honours have tarnished.\"\r\n\r\n   \"It is impossible (says Lord Blatchford about General Gordon) to\r\n   imagine a man more completely in the presence of God, or more\r\n   absolutely careless of his own distinction, comfort, wealth or life.  A\r\n   man unreservedly devoted to the cause of the oppressed.  One bows\r\n   before him as before a man of a superior order of things.\"  Mr.\r\n   Boulger says, \"There will never be another Gordon.\"  Sir William\r\n   Butler said of him, \"He was unselfish as Sydney; of courage, dauntless\r\n   as Wolfe; of honour, stainless as Outram; of sympathy, wide-reaching\r\n   as Drummond; of honesty, straightforward as Napier; of faith, as\r\n   steadfast as Moore.\"\r\n\r\nWe believe Gordon answered to all these encomiums and well deserved them.\r\n\r\nEdgmont Hake, writing of him says:--\"He lived wholly for others; his home\r\nat Gravesend was school, hospital, church, and almshouse all in one.  His\r\nwork more like that of a Home missionary than of a military officer.  The\r\ntroubles of all interested him alike, but he had a warm corner in his\r\nheart for lads.\"  This will be seen from letters produced.  Many of the\r\nlads he rescued from the slums and gutters; he cleaned them, clothed\r\nthem, fed them, and gave them shelter and home, sometimes for weeks and\r\neven longer.  He taught in the evenings lessons suitable to their\r\nconditions; not forgetting the moral and spiritual side of his work.  And\r\nhe did this work without fee or reward, and he did it with all his heart.\r\nHe was as enthusiastic about this duty as he was about his military\r\nduties.  He called these lads \"_His kings_.\"\r\n\r\nLeigh Hunt's ideal of a king describes very closely Gordon's ideal:--\r\n\r\n   \"'Tis not the wealth that makes a king\r\n   Nor the purple colouring,\r\n   Nor a brow that's bound with gold,\r\n   Nor gate on mighty hinges rolled;\r\n   That king is he who void of fear,\r\n   Can look abroad with bosom clear,\r\n   Who can tread ambition down,\r\n   Nor be swayed by smile nor frown,\r\n   Nor for all the treasure cares,\r\n   That mine conceals or harvest wears,\r\n   Or that golden sands deliver,\r\n   Bosomed on a glassy river,\r\n   Safe with wisdom for his crown,\r\n   He looks on all things calmly down,\r\n   He has no fear of earthly thing,\r\n   This is it that makes a king,\r\n   And all of us who e'er we be\r\n   May carve us out such royalty.\"\r\n\r\nOn one occasion a lad in the employ of a Gravesend tradesman was\r\ndiscovered to have been pilfering on a somewhat serious scale.  When the\r\nfact was proved beyond question, the master declared he would have the\r\nboy punished by imprisonment.  The mother of the boy, hearing of this sad\r\naffair, was almost broken-hearted, and at her wit's end.  Someone who had\r\nheard of Gordon's love for lads, also his intense desire to help all in\r\ntrouble, suggested that she should see him and explain her case.  So,\r\nwith all a mother's earnestness, she went at once to Gordon and told him\r\nthe whole story, and begged with tears for his sympathy and help.  After\r\nhearing the story his heart was touched, he could not refuse a mother's\r\nappeal.  When a mother pleads, there is power and pathos difficult for\r\nany to withstand, much less Gordon.  So he went to the lad's late\r\nemployer, and after considerable argument, the master undertook not to\r\nprosecute, but only on condition that Gordon would personally undertake\r\nto look after the lad himself, for one year at least.  This Gordon\r\npromised, and he took the boy to his own home, sent him to a good school\r\nat his own expense for the year; then he got him a good situation on\r\nboard one of Her Majesty's vessels.  That lad became a man of honour and\r\nrespectability, secured good situations, won for himself a good\r\ncharacter, and the mother and the sailor boy in their heart often blessed\r\nGordon, who saved the boy from prison, ruin and disgrace, and the mother\r\nfrom a broken heart.  His rescue work amongst boys was work he loved\r\nsupremely, in it he found his highest joys.  His pleasures were not\r\nsecured where many seek them, viz., at the theatre, at the\r\ngambling-house, at the racecourse, at the public-house, or in\r\naccumulating wealth, or in winning renown and glory--these were nothing\r\nto Gordon.  To save a fallen lad, was to him the highest gratification;\r\nin this work he was very successful.\r\n\r\nMany a rescued lad was he able to restore to his home and to society, and\r\nto the world.  For many of these lads he was able to secure situations on\r\nboard ship.  To show his interest in them when away he had a large map on\r\nhis study wall, in this map were pins in very many places.  These, he\r\ntold a visitor, showed the position of the ships on which his lads were\r\nlocated; and he moved the pins as the ships moved and prayed for each boy\r\nfrom day to day.  The workhouse and the infirmary were places he used to\r\nvisit, and his visits were remembered by the inmates, as all the fruits\r\nand flowers he could grow were given to these places and to the sick and\r\npoor whom he visited.  Very often the dying sent for him in preference to\r\na clergyman, and he was, if at home, always ready; no matter what the\r\nweather or what the distance.  His works were essentially works of\r\ncharity, and these were not done to be seen of men.  He was one of the\r\nhumblest men I ever met.  He would not occupy the chair at a meeting or\r\neven go on to the platform.  Once I remember he addressed a gathering\r\nafter tea of those who had been rescued and who were likely to be useful\r\nto others, but he would not be lionised or praised.  He would say, \"No; I\r\nam but the instrument: the praise belongs to God.\"  His spirit was the\r\nfruitful cause of all the work he did.\r\n\r\n   \"Give me that lowest place,\r\n   Not that I dare ask for that lowest place.\r\n   But Thou hast died that I might share\r\n   Thy glory by Thy side.\r\n   Give me that lowest place, or if for me\r\n   That lowest place too high\r\n   Make one more low, where I may sit\r\n   And see my God; and love Thee so.\"\r\n\r\nHe recognised \"that pure religion and undefiled before God the Father is\r\nthis, to visit the fatherless, and the widows in their affliction, and to\r\nkeep unspotted from the world.\"  This kindled his enthusiasm, influenced\r\nhis chivalrous character, and we think had largely to do with his\r\nsuccess.  To know him was to know a Christian, a Christlike man--God's\r\nman.\r\n\r\nWith Job (ch. 29, verses 11, 12, etc.) he could say truly--\r\n\r\n   \"When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; when the eye saw me, it\r\n   gave witness to me.  Because I delivered the poor that cried and the\r\n   fatherless, and him that had none to help him.  The blessing of him\r\n   that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart\r\n   to sing for joy.  I was eyes to the blind and feet was I to the lame.\r\n   I was a father to the poor, and the cause which I knew not I searched\r\n   out.\"\r\n\r\nHe could truly say\r\n\r\n   \"I live for those that love me:\r\n   For those that know me true;\r\n   For the heaven that smiles above me\r\n   And waits my coming too.\r\n   For the cause that needs assistance,\r\n   For the wrong that needs resistance.\r\n   For the future in the distance,\r\n   And for the good that I can do.\"\r\n\r\nUpon his removal from Gravesend in 1873 a local newspaper writing of his\r\nremoval, and deploring his loss, said--\"Our readers will hear with regret\r\nof the departure of Colonel Gordon from the town, in which he has resided\r\nfor six years; gaining a name for the most exquisite charity that will\r\nlong be remembered.  Nor will he be less missed than remembered, for in\r\nthe lowest walks of life he has been so unwearied in well-doing that his\r\ndeparture will be felt as a terrible calamity.  His charity was essential\r\ncharity, having its root in deep philanthropic feeling and goodness, and\r\nalways shunning the light of publicity.\"  Many were the friends who\r\ngrieved over his departure from Gravesend, for they ne'er would look upon\r\nhis like again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb e'er he dies, he shall\r\n   live no longer in monuments than the bell rings and his widow\r\n   weeps.\"--SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\nA new chapter now opens in our story of Gordon.  Sir Samuel Baker had\r\nresigned the honoured position of Governor General of the Soudan.  Gordon\r\nwas selected as the man who, of all others, was most suitable for such an\r\nappointment.  Our Government acquiesced in the Khedive's offer of this\r\npost to Gordon, so he accepted the responsible position.\r\n\r\nThe Khedive offered him, it is stated, a salary 10,000 pounds per annum;\r\nthis, however, he refused to accept.  He said \"Your Majesty I cannot\r\naccept it, as I should look upon it as the life's blood wrung out of\r\nthose poor people over whom you wish me to rule.\"  \"Name your own terms\r\nthen,\" said the Khedive.  \"Well,\" replied Gordon, \"2,000 pounds per annum\r\nI think will keep body and soul together, what should I require more than\r\nthis for.\"  About the close of the year 1873 he left his country and\r\nloved ones behind him, for that lone sad land, with its ancient history.\r\nWe think Gordon played such a part that his name will be honourably\r\nassociated with Egypt, and remembered from generation to generation.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to the author of _Gordon in Central Africa_ for the\r\nfollowing abstract of the Khedive's final instructions to Col. Gordon,\r\ndated Feb. 16th, 1874.\r\n\r\n   \"The province which Colonel Gordon has undertaken to organise and to\r\n   govern is but little known.  Up to the last few years, it had been in\r\n   the hands of adventurers who had thought of nothing but their own\r\n   lawless gains, and who had traded in ivory and slaves.  They\r\n   established factories and governed them with armed men.  The\r\n   neighbouring tribes were forced to traffic with them whether they\r\n   liked it or not.  The Egyptian Government, in the hope of putting an\r\n   end to this inhuman trade had taken the factories into their own\r\n   hands, paying the owners an indemnification.\r\n\r\n   Some of these men, nevertheless, had been still allowed to carry on\r\n   trade in the district, under a promise that they would not deal in\r\n   slaves.  They had been placed under the control of the Governor of the\r\n   Soudan.  His authority, however, had scarcely been able to make itself\r\n   felt in these remote countries.  The Khedive had resolved therefore to\r\n   form them into a separate government, and to claim as a monopoly of\r\n   the State, the whole of the trade with the outside world.  There was\r\n   no other way of putting an end to the slave trade which at present was\r\n   carried on by force of arms in defiance of law.  When once brigandage\r\n   had become a thing of the past, and when once a breach had been made\r\n   in the lawless customs of long ages, then trade might be made free to\r\n   all.  If the men who had been in the pay of adventurers were willing\r\n   to enter the service of the Government, Col. Gordon was to make all\r\n   the use of them he could.  If on the other hand they attempted to\r\n   follow their old course of life, whether openly or secretly, he was to\r\n   put in force against them to the utmost severity of martial law.  Such\r\n   men as these must find in the Governor neither indulgence, nor mercy.\r\n   The lesson must be made clear even in those remote parts that a mere\r\n   difference of colour does not turn men into wares, and that life and\r\n   liberty are sacred things.\"\r\n\r\nAnother object of the new Governor should be to establish a line of posts\r\nthrough all his provinces, so that from one end to the other they might\r\nbe brought into direct communication with Khartoum.  Those posts should\r\nfollow, as far as was possible, the line of the Nile; but for a distance\r\nof seventy miles the navigation of that river was hindered by rapids.  He\r\nwas to search out the best way of overcoming this hindrance, and to make\r\na report thereon to the Khedive.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the _Chieftains_ of the tribes which dwelt on the shores\r\nof the lakes, the Governor was above all to try to win their confidence.\r\nHe must respect their territory, and conciliate them by presents, and\r\nwhatever influence he gains over them, he must use in the endeavour to\r\npersuade them to put an end to the wars, which they so often make on each\r\nother in the hope of carrying off slaves.  Much tact would be needed, for\r\nshould he succeed in stopping the slave trade, while wars were still\r\nwaged among the chiefs, it might well come to pass that, for want of a\r\nmarket, the prisoners would, in such a case, be slaughtered.  Should he\r\nfind it needful to exercise a real control over any of these tribes, it\r\nwill be better to leave to the chieftains the direct government.  Their\r\nobedience must be secured by making them dread his power.\r\n\r\nHe made the journey to Khartoum without any mishap or serious difficulty,\r\nreaching there in May, 1874, and was installed in office on the fifth.  A\r\nroyal salute from the government house guns was fired in honour of this\r\nevent; the new Governor-General was, of course, expected to make a\r\nspeech, after the order of his predecessors.  But all he said was, \"With\r\nthe help of God I will hold the balance level.\"  This was received with\r\nthe greatest enthusiasm, for it evidently pleased the people more than if\r\nhe had addressed them for an hour.  His attention was soon directed\r\ntowards the poverty-stricken and helpless people all around him.  He\r\ncaused special enquiries to be made; then he began to distribute his\r\ngifts of charity to all who he believed were really in need; and in three\r\ndays he had given away one thousand pounds of his first year's salary.  He\r\nhad not been long in the Soudan before he realized the tremendous\r\nresponsibilities he had assumed; and with all his strength of character,\r\nand his trust in his Almighty, ever-present Friend, it is not to be\r\nwondered at that when alone in the trackless desert, with the results of\r\nages of wrong-doing before him, this man of heroic action and indomitable\r\nspirit sometimes gave way to depression and murmuring; although this was\r\nexceedingly rare.  If we remember what he had already done and suffered\r\nfor down-trodden humanity.  And that now he was doing heroic work for the\r\ntrue hero's wages--the love of Christ, and the good of his fellow-men.  He\r\nwas labouring not for himself, but as the hand of God in providence, in\r\nthe faith that his work was of God's own appointing.  The wonder is that\r\nin the face of perils so dangerous, work so difficult, and sufferings so\r\nintense, that his spirit was not completely crushed and broken.  We must\r\nbear in mind, his work there was to secure peace to a country that\r\nappeared to be bent on war; to suppress slavery amongst a people to whom\r\nit was a second nature, and to whom the trade in human flesh was life,\r\nand honour, and fortune.  To make and discipline an army out of the\r\nrawest recruits ever put in the field, to develop and grow a flourishing\r\ntrade, and to obtain a fair revenue, amid the wildest anarchy in the\r\nworld; the immensity of the undertaking, the infinity of detail involved\r\nin a single step toward this end, the countless odds to be faced; the\r\nmany pests, the deadly climate, the nightly and daily alternations of\r\noverpowering heat, and of bitter cold, to be endured and overcome; the\r\nenvironment of bestial savagery, and ruthless fanaticism;--all these\r\ncontributed to make the achievement unique in human history.  He was face\r\nto face with evil in its worst form, and saw it in all its appalling\r\neffects upon the nation and its people.  He seemed to have everything\r\nagainst him, and to be utterly alone.  There stood in front of him the\r\ngrim ruined land.  He faced it, however, as a saint and soldier should\r\ndo; he stood for right, truth, and for God.\r\n\r\n{Gordon on his favourite camel: p81.jpg}\r\n\r\n   \"He would dare to do right.  Dare to be true\r\n   He had a work that no other could do;\r\n   He would do it so wisely, so bravely, so well,\r\n   That angels might hasten the story to tell.\"\r\n\r\nAfter some time he writes:--\r\n\r\n   \"How the Khedive is towards me I don't know, but thank God he prevents\r\n   me caring for any one's favour or disfavour.  I honestly say I do not\r\n   know anyone who would endure the exile and worries of my position out\r\n   here.  Some might fear if they were dismissed, that the world would\r\n   talk.  Thank God! I am screened from that fear.  I know that I have\r\n   done my best, as far as my intellect would allow me, for the Khedive,\r\n   and have tried to be just to all.\"\r\n\r\nOn contemplating retirement, he writes:--\r\n\r\n   \"Now imagine what I lose by coming back, if God so wills it; a life in\r\n   a tent, with a cold humid air at night, to which if, from the heat of\r\n   the tent you expose yourself, you will suffer for it, either in liver\r\n   or elsewhere.  The most ordinary fare.  _Most_ ordinary I can assure\r\n   you; no vegetables, dry biscuits, a few bits of broiled meat, and some\r\n   dry macaroni, boiled in water and sugar.  I forgot some soup; up at\r\n   dawn and to bed between eight and nine p.m.  No books but one, and\r\n   that not often read for long, for I cannot sit down for a study of\r\n   those mysteries.  All day long, worrying about writing orders, to be\r\n   obeyed by others in the degree as they are near or distant from me:\r\n   obliged to think of the veriest trifle, even to the knocking off the\r\n   white ants from the stores, etc.--that is one's life; and, speaking\r\n   materially, for what gain?  At the end of two years, say 2,000 pounds.\r\n   At the end of three say 3,500 pounds at the outside.  The gain to be\r\n   called 'His Excellency,' and this money.  Yet his poor 'Excellency'\r\n   has to slave more than any individual; to pull ropes, to mend this;\r\n   make a cover to that (just finished a capital cover to the duck Gun).\r\n   I often say, 'drop the excellency, and do this instead.'\"\r\n\r\nAgain he writes:--\r\n\r\n   \"This country would soon cure a man of his ambition, I think, and make\r\n   him content with his lot.  The intense heat, and other stagnation\r\n   except you have some disagreeable incident, would tame the most\r\n   enthusiastic; a thin, miserable tent under which you sit, with the\r\n   perspiration pouring off you.  A month of this life, and you would be\r\n   dissatisfied with your lot.\"\r\n\r\nGordon had kept up some very interesting correspondence with an old\r\nfriend in China; an old officer in Gordon's \"Ever victorious Army,\" Li\r\nHung Chang.  While Gordon is feeling unwell, and disposed to send his\r\nresignation to the Khedive--he writes in his journal:--\r\n\r\n   July 21st, 1879.\r\n\r\n   \"I shall (D.V.) leave for Cairo in ten days, and I hope to see you\r\n   soon; but I may have to go to Johannis before I go to Cairo.  I am a\r\n   wreck, like the portion of the 'Victory' towed into Gibraltar after\r\n   Trafalgar; but God has enabled me, or rather has used me, to do what I\r\n   wished to do--that is, break down the slave trade.  \"Those that honour\r\n   me I will honour.\"  May I be ground to dust, if He will glorify\r\n   Himself in me; but give me a humble heart, for then he dwells there in\r\n   comfort.  I wrote you a letter about my illness and tore it up.  Thank\r\n   God, I am pretty well now, but I have passed the grave once lately,\r\n   and never thought to see Khartoum.  The new Khedive is more civil, but\r\n   I no longer distress myself with such things.  God is the sole ruler,\r\n   and I try to walk sincerely before Him.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter from Li Hung Chang was to him a source of great satisfaction\r\nand pleasure, as it showed his example had affected for good this eastern\r\nambassador, who visited this country only a very few years ago.\r\n\r\nThe letter ran thus:--\r\n\r\n   TIENTSIN,\r\n   _March 22nd_, _1879_.\r\n\r\n   \"To His Excellency Colonel C. G. Gordon,\r\n   Khartoum, Egypt.\r\n\r\n   \"Dear Sir.--I am instructed by his Excellency the Grand Secretary, Li,\r\n   to answer your esteemed favour, dated the 27th October, 1878, from\r\n   Khartoum, which was duly received.  I am right glad to hear from you.\r\n   It is now fourteen years since we parted from each other.  Although I\r\n   have not written to you, I often speak of you, and remember you with\r\n   very great interest.  The benefit you have conferred on China does not\r\n   appear with your person, but is felt throughout the regions in which\r\n   you played so important and active a part.  All those people bless you\r\n   for the blessings of peace and prosperity which they now enjoy.\r\n\r\n   Your achievements in Egypt are well known throughout the civilized\r\n   world.  I see often in the papers of your noble works on the Upper\r\n   Nile.  You are a man of ample resources, with which you suit yourself\r\n   to any emergency.  My hope is that you may long be spared to improve\r\n   the conditions of the people amongst whom your lot is cast.  I am\r\n   striving hard to advance my people to a higher state of development,\r\n   and to unite both this and all other nations within the 'Four seas'\r\n   under one common brotherhood.\r\n\r\n   I wish you all manner of happiness and prosperity.  With my highest\r\n   regards,\r\n\r\n   I remain,\r\n   Yours truly,\r\n   LI HUNG CHANG.\"\r\n\r\nIn all, and through all these various trying vicissitudes he remained\r\ntrue to his innate religious convictions, and looked upon it all as the\r\nfilling in of a plan, which was divine.  His hours for prayer were\r\nmaintained with as great a regularity as were those of another eastern\r\nofficial servant, Daniel, who \"three times a day kneeled on his knees and\r\nprayed and gave thanks to God.\"  Gordon, when at prayer, placed outside\r\nhis tent a white handkerchief, this was the sign the Governor was at his\r\ndevotions, and no servant or messenger must disturb him.  He kept closely\r\nin touch with God, so to speak.  His outer life might be ruffled by\r\nstorms and tempests, but within he had the perfect peace.\r\n\r\nWhile Gordon was hoping to get away from the trying climate and yet more\r\ntrying circumstances around him, a message (not unexpected) reached him,\r\ngiving him instructions to proceed to Abyssinia, and see if he could\r\nsettle the dispute or misunderstanding that had arisen between Johannis\r\nthe King and the Khedive.  He proceeded on that very risky mission as he\r\nstates in his letters; the journey was \"indescribable in its solitary\r\ngrandeur.  These interminable deserts, and arid mountain passes fill the\r\nheart with far different thoughts than civilized lands do.\"  With few\r\nattendants, he writes:--\"We are still slowly crawling over the world's\r\ncrust.  Reaching the dominions of the King of Abyssinia, we camped near\r\nRas Alonla, and the priests used to gather at 3 a.m. in knots of two and\r\nthree and chant for an hour in a wild melodious manner the Psalms of\r\nDavid.  Awakened at this unearthly hour no one could help being\r\nimpressed.  Some of them had children who chanted.\"  Again he writes:--\"We\r\nhave just passed a famous convent.  The great high priest, who only comes\r\nout to meet the King, and who is supposed to be the King's right hand in\r\nreligious questions, came out to meet us.  I had some splendid silk\r\nbrocade, which I gave him.  He held a gold cross in his hand, and spoke\r\nof the love of Christ.  He seemed to be a deeply religious man.\"\r\n\r\nFather Soho says of Abyssinia:--\r\n\r\n   \"No country in the world is so full of churches, monasteries, and\r\n   ecclesiastics, as Abyssinia.  It is hardly possible to sing in one\r\n   church, or monastery, without being heard in another, and perhaps by\r\n   several.  They sing the Psalms of David, of which they have a very\r\n   exact translation in their own language.  They begin their concert by\r\n   stamping their feet on the ground, and playing gently on their\r\n   instruments; but when have become warm by degrees, they leave off\r\n   drumming, and fall to leaping, dancing, shouting and clapping hands,\r\n   till their is neither tune nor pause, but rather a religious riot.  For\r\n   this manner of religious worship, they quote the Psalm--\"O clap your\r\n   hands, all ye nations.\"  Gordon says, \"I could not but like this poor\r\n   simple-minded peasantry.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he writes:--\r\n\r\n   \"We are about a days march from the river Taczzi, which joins the Nile\r\n   at Berber.  Nearing the Palace, if so I may call it, I was met by the\r\n   King's body guard.  I was of course wearing the Crest and Field\r\n   Marshal's uniform; the soldiers were sitting on their heels and never\r\n   got up.  Passing through them I found my mule so tired that I got down\r\n   and walked.  On arrival at the Palace, I was admitted to the King, who\r\n   sat upon a raised dais, with the Itage, or Chief Priest on the ground\r\n   at his left hand.  Then guns were fired, and the King said, \"That is\r\n   in your honour, and you can retire,\" which I did, to see him again\r\n   shortly.  Again Gordon visited the Royal personage, and was granted\r\n   permission to present his case, but Gordon considered himself unduly\r\n   humbled as he was ordered to stand afar off; a stool at length was\r\n   placed for him to sit upon.  This humble position Gordon would at\r\n   other times have accepted and tolerated, but not here and now; he must\r\n   show his dignity as the representative of a Foreign, powerful monarch;\r\n   he seized the stool and carried it up to near where the King sat, and\r\n   placed it by his side, saying, \"Though in your hands I may be a\r\n   prisoner, I am a man as much as you are, and can only meet you as an\r\n   equal.\"    His sable Majesty was greatly annoyed at Gordon's audacious\r\n   conduct, and remarking said, \"Gordon Pasha don't you know I am the\r\n   King, and could kill you if I wished.\"  \"I am perfectly aware of\r\n   that,\" said Gordon, \"Do so at once if it is your Royal pleasure, I am\r\n   ready.\"  \"What,\" said the King, \"Ready to be killed?\"  \"Certainly,\"\r\n   said Gordon, \"I am always ready to die, and so far from fearing you\r\n   putting me to death, you would confer a favour on me by so doing, for\r\n   you would be doing for me that which I am precluded by my religious\r\n   convictions from doing for myself.  You would relieve me from all the\r\n   troubles the future may have in store for me.\"  \"Then my power has no\r\n   terror for you, Gordon!\"  \"None whatever,\" he replied.  So Gordon\r\n   proved more than a match for this half-civilized Abyssinian King.  His\r\n   visit, however, could not be considered successful as his Majesty was\r\n   unreasonable in all his demands, and so put out of the power of Gordon\r\n   to reach any settlement.  So he left the King without effecting what\r\n   he came to do.  How to get away now was to him a source of anxiety.  As\r\n   he surmised, they were not likely to allow him to carry back the\r\n   valuables he had in his possession.  It required all his tact and wit\r\n   and discretion in this perilous position.  He, however, at the cost of\r\n   about 1,400 pounds in bribes and gifts, managed to get away.  Then he\r\n   had to find his way back alone.  This was a severe ordeal.  Over\r\n   mountains covered with snow, and through defiles of rocky places, now\r\n   meeting with wild hordes of the dog-faced baboons, then with the\r\n   uncivilized tribes of the human species none the less dangerous.  He,\r\n   however, by the care of an ever watchful Providence, had escaped\r\n   serious harm and reached Khartoum in safety.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"There is no death, what seems so is transition.\r\n   This life of mortal breath is but the suburb of the life Elysian,\r\n         Whose portals we call Death.\"--LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\nGordon had felt for some time uneasy in his position, as the under\r\nofficials looked upon him as a religious fanatic, and too strict to\r\ngovern; they tried to annoy him, and they succeeded: so he sent in his\r\nresignation to the Khedive, and as soon as he could conveniently, he\r\nturned his face homeward.\r\n\r\nFirst of course he visited the Khedive, and he received from him a\r\nprincely welcome, being addressed by him in these words: \"I am glad to\r\nsee you Gordon Pasha again amongst us, and have great pleasure in once\r\nmore personally acknowledging the loyalty with which you always served my\r\ncountry, and my government.  I should very much like you to remain in my\r\nservice, but if you must retire from us, as you say you must, then I am\r\nreluctantly compelled to accept your resignation.  I regret, my dear\r\nGordon, to lose so valued a counsellor and friend, and the hearty\r\nco-operation of so useful a servant: and in parting from you, I desire to\r\nexpress my sincere thanks to you; assuring you that my remembrance of you\r\nand of your services to this country will never be forgotten.\"\r\n\r\nGordon was greatly in need of the rest he now seemed to have secured by\r\nhis resignation.  His over sensitive nature could not have borne up much\r\nlonger; a frame of iron must have gone under in such circumstances; for\r\non his own individual shoulders he carried each man's burden, causing him\r\ndays of anxiety and nights of unrest.  At Alexandria he was examined by\r\nDr. MacKie the surgeon to the British Consulate, who certified that he\r\nwas \"suffering from symptoms of nervous exhaustion.  I have recommended\r\nhim (the Dr. adds) to retire for several months for complete rest, and\r\nquiet--and that he may be able to enjoy fresh and wholesome food, as I\r\nconsider much of this illness is the result of continued bodily fatigue,\r\nanxiety and indigestible food.  I have strongly insisted on his\r\nabstaining from all exciting work--especially such as implies business or\r\npolitical excitement.\"  Splendid advice, but would Gordon follow it?\r\nCould his active life be suppressed even for so short a time?  None find\r\nit harder to rest than those who need it most.  Gordon had often thought\r\nof what pleasure in rest he would find when his retirement was an\r\naccomplished fact.  He would lie in bed until dinner.  He would take\r\nshort walks after dinner.  He would undertake no long journeys, either\r\ndriving or by railway.  He would not be tempted to go to dinner parties.\r\nHe would really have a quiet time; it was, however, only for a short\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe private secretaryship to Lord Ripon was vacant, and it was offered to\r\nGordon; he accepted it, but on landing at Bombay he found the position\r\nwould not be to his liking.  He says of Lord Ripon, \"we parted perfect\r\nfriends.\"  After Gordon left Egypt someone there wrote to our press\r\nsaying, \"The name of Gordon whenever and wherever mentioned sends a\r\nthrill of admiration and love throughout the vast Soudan territory.  For\r\na hand so strong, yet withal so beneficent, has never before ruled the\r\npeoples of this unhappy country.\"  Gordon left the Soudan peaceful,\r\nprosperous and happy, comparatively.  After his resignation of the\r\nposition of private secretary to Lord Ripon, he was invited to visit\r\nChina again by Mr. Hart, Chinese Commissioner of Customs at Pekin, who\r\nsaid to Gordon, \"I am directed to invite you here (that is to say China).\r\nPlease come and see for yourself.  This opportunity for doing really\r\nuseful work on a large scale ought not to be lost: work, position,\r\nconditions can all be arranged with yourself here to your satisfaction.\r\nDo take six months leave and come.\"  It was characteristic of Gordon that\r\nhe replied as follows:--\"Inform Hart, Gordon will leave for Shanghai\r\nfirst opportunity; as for the conditions, Gordon is indifferent.\"\r\n\r\nHe applied to our Government for leave of absence on the grounds that he\r\nwas invited to go to China.  They asked him to state more particularly\r\nwhat for, and what position he was intending to fill.  \"I am ignorant\"\r\nwas his reply.  This was not considered satisfactory and leave was\r\nrefused.  He, however, sent his resignation to the War Office, and\r\nproceeded to China.  Reaching the flowery land, once more he proceeded\r\nfrom Shanghai to Tientsin and there he had an interview with his old\r\nfriend and companion in arms, Li Hung Chang.  From him he learned the\r\ncondition in which national and political matters stood.  His stay in\r\nChina was not very prolonged, but his influence was felt in the Councils\r\nof the Empire; and when he left he knew that peace prevailed, and that\r\nthe war between Russia and China had been averted.  In the meantime\r\nthings in the Soudan began to give trouble, the cloud on the horizon\r\ngathered in blackness.  Almost immediately Gordon left the Soudan the\r\nTurkish Pashas began their plundering, robbing and ill-treating the poor\r\nSoudanese so much that we cannot wonder at the rising of the natives in\r\nfavour of the Madhi, for the latter was promising them deliverance from\r\nthis cruel oppression.  The rule of the Pashas and Bashi-Ba-Zoucks, the\r\nDuke of Argyle declared to be \"cruel, intolerant, and unbearable.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Stewart, in his report, stated that \"he believed not one half of\r\nthe taxes wrung from these poor people ever found their money go into the\r\ntreasury of the Khedive.\"  They were taxed and levied so unjustly and\r\nunmercifully that whole districts were reduced to absolute destitution.\r\nThe general rising of the natives against this dire oppression, threw\r\nthem into the arms of the Madhi.  He very soon had a most powerful\r\nfollowing, and he quickly mobilized an army that in 1882 was believed to\r\nnumber not less than 200,000 fighting men.  In July of that year this\r\nboastful usurper pushed his forces into conflict with the Egyptians, when\r\nthe latter were worsted with terrible loss.  About 6,000 of their bravest\r\nmen were either killed in battle or left wounded on the field and the\r\nremainder were routed.  Shortly after another great battle followed.  This\r\nalso went in favour of the usurper, and a loss of 10,000 men inflicted.\r\nOne engagement followed another and all went to show that the Madhi had\r\nwon the sympathy and support of the masses of the people, and it appeared\r\nlikely he would soon have undisputed sway over the entire Soudan.  Still\r\nanother effort was to be made to hurl back this powerful and persistent\r\nfoe.  Hicks Pasha, \"a brave leader,\" \"a noble general,\" with an army of\r\n10,000 men, with 6,000 camels, a large number of pack horses and mules,\r\nwas sent to arrest the advance of this desperate foe.  For some time no\r\nnews reached us, as he was shut out from all means of communication with\r\nthe outer world.  At length the appalling news came, not only of his\r\ndefeat, but of his utter destruction.  One man only was known to have\r\nescaped to tell the tale.  He states, \"We were led by a treacherous guide\r\ninto a mountain pass or defile, and there shut in by rocks; we were\r\nconfronted and surrounded by probably 100,000 of the enemy.  For three\r\ndays and nights the battle raged; the few British officers fought like\r\nlions against these overwhelming odds, until, so completely cut up by\r\nsword, bullet and spear, that he feared he was the only man who managed\r\nto escape.\"  This large army was literally annihilated--1,200 officers\r\nperished in this one battle.  The Madhi took 17,000 Remington rifles, 7\r\nKrupp guns, 6 Nordenfelts, 29 brass mounted cannon, and a very large\r\namount of ammunition.  So that he appeared to be master of the situation.\r\n\"What next for the Soudan?\" was being everywhere asked in Egypt and in\r\nthe Soudan.  \"Oh that Gordon was here,\" was the cry of many of the poor\r\ndown-trodden Soudanese.  They believed him to be the only man who could\r\nbring peace to their desolate and unhappy country.\r\n\r\nGordon was at that time taking a quiet rest near Jaffa, in the Holy Land,\r\nand making investigations into places specially spoken of in the\r\nScriptures.  He thought he could locate the place where Samuel took Agag\r\nand hewed him to pieces.  Also the well, called \"Jacob's Well,\" and other\r\nplaces of interest.  It is said at this juncture, things in the Soudan\r\nhad become hopeless.  A gentleman sent to one of the papers at Cairo the\r\nfollowing message: \"Would to God that an angel would stand at the elbow\r\nof Lord Granville in London, and say, And now send men to Joppa, and call\r\nfor one Gordon, and he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.\"  Strange\r\nto say, about this time, Gordon was sent for to London, where he had\r\ninterviews with Lord Hartington, Secretary of State for War, Lord\r\nGranville, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Lord Northbrook, First Lord of\r\nthe Admiralty, and Sir Charles Dilke, President of the Local Government\r\nBoard, at the War Office, and in a very short space of time, the\r\nquestion, which was destined to have far reaching results, was settled,\r\nand Gordon declared his willingness to go to Khartoum at the earliest\r\npossible date.  Indeed he said, \"At once,\" and to go alone.\r\n\r\nSomething like the following conversation is said to have taken place\r\nbetween Gordon and one of his very intimate friends: \"Well, General, have\r\nyou got your kit ready?\"  His reply was, \"I have got what I always have:\r\nthis hat is good enough, so are these clothes, my boots I think are\r\nstrong enough.\"  \"And how are you off for cash?\"  \"Ah! I was nearly\r\nforgetting that.  I had to borrow 25 pounds from the King of the Belgians\r\nto bring me home from Palestine; this I must repay, and I shall of course\r\nneed a little more for common daily use.\"  \"How much do you think, two or\r\nthree thousand pounds?\"  \"Oh dear no!  One hundred pounds apiece for\r\nmyself and Stewart, will be enough; what on earth should we want so much\r\nmoney for.\"  And so the gallant general, with his faithful companion--the\r\nlate lamented Colonel Stewart, started.\r\n\r\nWe are told they were accompanied to Charing Cross railway station by H.\r\nR. H. the Duke of Cambridge, who took their tickets for them; also by\r\nLord Wolseley (who would insist on carrying Gordon's portmanteau),\r\nColonel Brackenbury, and Lord Hartington's private secretary, who bade\r\nthem good-bye, and God speed on their mission, from which they were never\r\nto return.  We think history will never record a more heroic example of\r\npatriotism, than that of this God-fearing officer, riding forth upon his\r\nswift footed camel, with only one English friend and companion, the\r\nColonel Stewart, and a few Arab attendants, to confront and settle the\r\nwild and barbarous hordes of the Madhi.\r\n\r\nOne of our papers published the following appropriate lines:--\r\n\r\n   \"Not with an army at command,\r\n   Not fenced about with guns and swords,\r\n   But trusting to their single hands,\r\n   Amid a host of savage hordes,\r\n   The hero Gordon wends in haste,\r\n   Across the desert's arid waste,\r\n   Beset with perils lies his way,\r\n   Yet fear he knows not: Nelson like,\r\n   His life would be an easy prey,\r\n   If but the Arab dare to strike.\r\n   But over him there hangs a spell,\r\n   The Soudan people know full well:\r\n   Oft he had taught the Eastern mind\r\n   The grace of noble-hearted deeds;\r\n   Oft cast abuses to the wind,\r\n   And succoured men in direst needs;\r\n   Nor shall the charm that all allow\r\n   Is grandly his, forsake him now:\r\n   Oh! should the power of his name\r\n   Bend the false prophet to its thrall\r\n   And make him deem the hero came,\r\n   To pay him just a friendly call,\r\n   The ruthless carnage soon might cease,\r\n   And Egypt be again at peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject of Gordon's mission came up several times in the British\r\nHouse of Commons as might be expected.  Sir Stafford Northcote on one\r\noccasion said--\"There is one point upon which all our minds are fixed--I\r\nmean the mission of General Gordon.  On that point I was anxious to say\r\nlittle or nothing.  General Gordon is now engaged in an attempt of the\r\nmost gallant and dangerous kind.  No one can speak with too much\r\nadmiration of his courage and self-devotion: no one can fail, in this\r\ncountry to sympathise with him, and earnestly desire his safety and\r\nsuccess.\"\r\n\r\nReaching Cairo, Gordon received his plans and instructions from the\r\nKhedive, and here we think arose some of the complications and\r\nmisunderstandings as to his actual position.  Was he in the employ of the\r\nKhedive, or was he still responsible to the Home Government?  The Khedive\r\nexpressed himself to Gordon in a letter dated Jan. 26, 1884.\r\n\r\n\"Excellency,--You are aware that the object of your arrival here, and of\r\nyour mission to the Soudan is to carry into execution the evacuation of\r\nthose territories, and to withdraw our troops, civil officials, and such\r\nof the inhabitants, together with their belongings, as may wish to leave\r\nfor Egypt.  We trust that your Excellency will adopt the most effective\r\nmeasures for the accomplishment of your mission in this respect, and\r\nthat, after completing the evacuation, you will take the necessary steps\r\nfor establishing an organized Government in the different provinces of\r\nthe Soudan, for the maintenance of order, and the cessation of disasters,\r\nand incitement to revolt.  We have full confidence in your tried\r\nabilities and tact, and are convinced that you will accomplish your\r\nmission according to your desire.\"\r\n\r\nThis was hardly in harmony with a telegram from Lord Granville who said\r\nthat \"_undertaking military expeditions was beyond the scope of the\r\nCommission he held_, _and at variance with the pacific policy which was\r\nthe purpose of his mission to the Soudan_.\"  Between the Khedive's\r\ninstructions and commission to Gordon, and his holding commission as an\r\nofficer of the Crown, Gordon was in a very difficult position, and those\r\nwho have blamed Mr. Gladstone, for what they may have been pleased to\r\ncall \"desertion of Gordon,\" should acquaint themselves with all the\r\ncircumstances of the case before doing so, and when all is known, such\r\nblame will be withheld.\r\n\r\nGordon, without lingering in Cairo, hastened to cross the desert and get\r\nto Khartoum as quickly as possible.  Thus our hero went forth with a\r\ngallantry never surpassed, if ever equalled.  He rode his camel across\r\nthat land of storm and drought, trusting only in Him, who had so often\r\n\"covered his defenceless head, beneath the shadow of His wing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Not all who seem to fail have failed indeed,\r\n   Not all who fail have therefore worked in vain;\r\n   There is no failure for the good and wise;\r\n   What though the seed should fall by the way-side,\r\n   And the birds snatch it; yet the birds are fed,\r\n   Or they may bear it far across the tide\r\n   To give rich harvests after thou art dead.\"\r\n\r\n   KINGSLEY.\r\n\r\nSir E. Baring wired to Lord Granville, \"The interview between Gordon and\r\nthe Khedive was very satisfactory.\"  Again--\"Gordon leaves Cairo in good\r\nspirits.\"\r\n\r\nHis arrival at Khartoum, it is stated, was marked by wonderful\r\ndemonstrations of welcome by the people; thousands of them pressing\r\ntowards him to kiss his feet: calling him the \"Sultan of the Soudan.\"  His\r\nfirst speech was received with the wildest enthusiasm.  He said, \"I come\r\nnot with soldiers but with God on my side, to redress the wrongs of the\r\nSoudan.\"  The day after he held a levee at the palace, when vast\r\nmultitudes thronged around him, kissing the ground on which he walked,\r\ncalling him \"Father,\" \"Sultan,\" \"Saviour.\"  He appreciated highly their\r\napparent loyalty and devotion, and he had offices opened at once where\r\neveryone who had a grievance might bring it, have it heard and judged.\r\n\r\nThe Government books recording the outstanding debts of the over-taxed\r\npeople, _were publicly burned in the presence of thousands of onlookers;\r\nthe kourbasher_, _whips_, _and implements of torture were thrown down\r\nupon the blazing pile_: thus the evidence of debts, and the emblems of\r\noppression perished together in the presence of an almost frenzied\r\npeople!  Next Gordon visited the prisons; there he found dreadful dens of\r\nmisery; over two hundred poor starving emaciated beings were confined\r\ntherein; some bound with chains: some mere boys, some old men and women.\r\nMany of them were there simply on suspicion, and had never had a hearing.\r\nThe cases were quickly and carefully enquired into, and before sunset\r\nthat day, most of the unhappy wretches had their chains struck off and\r\ntheir freedom given them.\r\n\r\nFor many days, the markets and shops, and bazaars were finely\r\nilluminated; and the rejoicing for Gordon's presence and deeds was\r\ngeneral and universal.  Alas, however, the cloud which had so long hung\r\nover the Soudan began to thicken.  The Madhi was not to be cheated of\r\nwhat he thought his rightful authority and dominion.  The following\r\nletter recorded in Gordon's journal was received by him from the Madhi:--\r\n\r\n   \"In the name of God the merciful and compassionate;\r\n   Praise be to God, the bountiful ruler, and blessing\r\n   on our Lord Mahomet and peace.  From the servant who\r\n   trusts in God--Mahomet, the son of Abdallah.\r\n\r\n   To Gordon Pasha of Khartoum,--May God guide him into the path of\r\n   virtue, Amen!  Know that your small steamer, named 'Abbas' which you\r\n   sent with the intention of forwarding your news to Cairo, by the way\r\n   of Dongola, the persons sent being your representative, Stewart Pasha,\r\n   and the two Consuls, French and English, with other persons, has been\r\n   captured by the will of God.  Those who believed in us as the Madhi\r\n   and surrendered, have been delivered; and those who did not have been\r\n   destroyed.  As your representative afore-named, with the Consuls and\r\n   the rest--whose souls God has condemned to the fire and to eternal\r\n   misery: That steamer and all that was in it have fallen a prey to the\r\n   Moslems, and we have taken knowledge of all the letters and telegrams\r\n   which were in it, in Arabic and in Frankish (languages) and of the\r\n   maps, which were opened to us (translated) by those on whom God has\r\n   bestowed his gifts, and has enlightened their hearts with faith, and\r\n   the benefits of willing submission.  Also we have found therein the\r\n   letters sent from you to the Mudir of Dongola, with the letters, &c.,\r\n   accompanying to be forwarded to Egypt and to European countries.  All\r\n   have been seized, and the contents are known.  It should all have been\r\n   returned to you, not being wanted here; but as it was originally sent\r\n   from you, and is known to you, we prefer to send you part of the\r\n   contents, and mention the property therein, so that you may be\r\n   certified: and in order that the truth may make a lasting impression\r\n   on my mind--in the hope that God may guide thee to the faith of Islam,\r\n   and to surrender to him and to us, that so you and they may obtain\r\n   everlasting good and happiness.  Now, first among the documents seized\r\n   is the cipher dated September 22, 1884, 'to the Mudir of Dongola.' . .\r\n   .  On the back of which is your telegram to the Khedive of Egypt . . .\r\n   We have also taken knowledge of your journal (daily record) of the\r\n   provision in the granary . . .  Also your letters written in European\r\n   all about the size of Khartoum; and all about the arranging of the\r\n   steamers, with the number of troops in them and their arms, and the\r\n   cannon, and about the movements of the troops, and the defeat of your\r\n   people, and your request for reinforcements, even if only a single\r\n   regiment, and all about how your agent Cuzzi turned Moslem.  Also many\r\n   letters which had come to you from your lieutenants and what they\r\n   contained of advice, also stating the number of Europeans at Khartoum\r\n   . . . .  Also the diary (registry) of the arms, ammunition, guns and\r\n   soldiers . . . .  We have also noted the telegrams of the officials\r\n   and of the presidents of Courts, and of the Kadi and the Muftis, and\r\n   Ulema, numbering 34, sent to the Mohurdar of the Khedive in Egypt,\r\n   dated Aug. 28th, 1884, in which they ask for succour from the Egyptian\r\n   Government . . .  Also your cipher telegrams to the Mohurdar of the\r\n   Khedive in which you explain that on your arrival at Khartoum the\r\n   impossibility had become clear to you of withdrawing the troops and\r\n   the employes, and sending them to Egypt, on account of the rebellions\r\n   in the country, and on the closing of the roads; for which reason you\r\n   ask for reinforcements which did not come . . .  Also about your\r\n   coming to Khartoum with seven men after the annihilation of Hicks'\r\n   army; and your requesting a telegram to be sent to you in Arabic, in\r\n   plain language, about the Soudan to show to the people of Khartoum--as\r\n   the telegrams in European cipher do not explain enough . . .  Also\r\n   your letter to the Khedive of Egypt, without date, in which you ask to\r\n   have English soldiers sent . . .  And your letter to the President of\r\n   the Council and the English Minister at Cairo, in which you speak of\r\n   your appointing three steamers to go and inquire as to the state of\r\n   Sennaar, and that you will send soldiers to Berber by the steamers to\r\n   recapture it, sending with them Stewart and the Consuls, whom the Most\r\n   High God has destroyed.  Also we have seen the two seals engraved with\r\n   our name to imitate our seals . . . .  Tricks in making ciphers, and\r\n   using so many languages, are of no avail.  From the Most High God, to\r\n   whom be praise, no secrets can be hidden.  As to your expecting\r\n   reinforcements, reliance for succour on others than God, that will\r\n   bring you nothing but destruction, and cause you to fall into utmost\r\n   danger in this world and the next.  For God Most High has dispersed\r\n   sedition through our manifestation, and has vanquished the wicked and\r\n   obstinate people, and has guided those who have understanding in the\r\n   way of righteousness.  And there is no refuge but in God, and in\r\n   obedience to His command, and that of His prophet and of His Madhi.  No\r\n   doubt you have heard what has happened to your brethren from whom you\r\n   expected help, at Suakin and elsewhere, whom God has destroyed, and\r\n   dispersed and abandoned.  Notwithstanding all this, as we have arrived\r\n   at a days journey from Omdurman and are coming please God, to your\r\n   place, if you return to the most High God and become a Moslem and\r\n   surrender to His Order and that of His prophet, and believe in us as\r\n   the Madhi, send us a message from thee, and from those with thee,\r\n   after laying down your arms and giving up the thought of fighting, so\r\n   that I may send you one with safe conduct, by which you will obtain\r\n   assurance of benefits of the blessings of this world and the next.\r\n   Otherwise, and if you do not act thus, you will have to encounter war\r\n   from God and His prophet.  And know that the Most High God is mighty\r\n   for thy destruction, as He has destroyed others before thee, who were\r\n   much stronger than thee, and more numerous.  And you, and your\r\n   children and your property, will be for a prey to the monsters, and\r\n   you will repent when repentance will not avail . . .  And there is no\r\n   succourer or strength but in God, and peace be upon those who have\r\n   followed the Madhi.  (_Guidance_.)\r\n\r\n   POSTSCRIPT.--\"In one of your cipher-telegrams sent to Bahkri and\r\n   seized, you mention that the troops present in Bahr Gazelle and the\r\n   Equator and elsewhere number 30,000 soldiers whom you cannot leave\r\n   behind, even though you should die.  And know that Bahr Gazelle and\r\n   the Equator are both of them under our power and both have followed us\r\n   as Madhi, and that they and their chiefs and all their officers are\r\n   now among the auxiliaries of the Madhi.  And they have joined our\r\n   lieutenants in that part, and letters from them are constantly coming\r\n   and going without hinderence or diminution of numbers. . . .  By this\r\n   thou wilt see and understand that it is not under thy command as thou\r\n   thinkest.  And for thy better information and our compassion for thee\r\n   we have added this postscript.\r\n\r\n   (_Seal_.)\r\n\r\n   There is no God but Allah.\r\n   Mahomet is the prophet Allah.\r\n   Mahomet the Madhi, son of Abd Allah.\"\r\n\r\n   Year 1292.\r\n\r\nGordon's reply was just what we should expect from an officer of his\r\ntemperament and experience.  It is true things looked anything but\r\ncheering and our hero needed all his force of character and confidence in\r\nthe God of Israel.  This he had and kept brightly burning.  To the Madhi\r\nhe replied--\r\n\r\n   \"Sheikh Mahomed Achmed has sent us a letter to inform us that Lupton\r\n   Bey, Mudir of 'Bahr Gazelle' has surrendered to him, and that the\r\n   small steamer in which was Stewart Pasha, has been captured by him,\r\n   together with what was therein.  But to me it is all one whether\r\n   Lupton Bey has surrendered or has not surrendered.  And whether he has\r\n   captured twenty thousand steamers like the 'Abbas' or twenty thousand\r\n   officers like Stuart Pasha or not; it is all one to me.  I am here\r\n   like iron, and hope to see the newly arrived English; and if Mahomed\r\n   Achmed says that the English die, it is all the same to me.  And you\r\n   must take a copy of this and give it to the messenger from Slatin, and\r\n   send him out early in the morning, that he may go to him.  It is\r\n   impossible for me to have any more words with Mahomed Achmed, only\r\n   lead; and if Mahomed Achmed is willing to fight he had better, instead\r\n   of going to Omdurman, go to the white hill by the moat.\"\r\n\r\n   (Signed) C. G. GORDON.\r\n\r\nGordon, though borne up by a sense of the Divine presence, yet he\r\noccasionally at least, felt as if he was leading a forlorn hope.  We know\r\nnot, nor can we ever know all the deeds of heroism he did for that down\r\ntrodden people.\r\n\r\n   \"A life long year unsuccoured and alone\r\n   He stemmed the fury of fanatic strife,\r\n   Till all lands claimed the hero as their own,\r\n   And wondering would he there lay down his life.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a mystery, and one that will never be solved, how he supported his\r\nvast family in Khartoum; for food had to be distributed to each\r\nindividual member for months.  It is also a sad but remarkable fact, that\r\nthrough the last ten months he had to depend upon the most unreliable and\r\nworthless of troops.  And for four of those weary months, he had been\r\nwithout the cheering presence of his companion in arms, Colonel Stewart.\r\nYet he held out bravely, courageously, and in hope of English help.  At\r\nthis juncture a poetess wrote--\r\n\r\n   \"A message from one who went in haste\r\n   Came flashing across the sea,\r\n   It told not of weakness, but trust in God,\r\n   When it asked us--pray for me.\r\n   And since from Churches, and English homes,\r\n   In the day or the twilight dim,\r\n   A chorus of prayers went up to God--\r\n   Bless and take care of him:\r\n   A lonely man to those strange far lands,\r\n   He has gone with a word of peace;\r\n   And a million hearts are questioning\r\n   With a pain that cannot cease:\r\n   Is Gordon safe?  Is there news of him?\r\n   What will the tidings be?\r\n   There is little to do but trust and wait;\r\n   Yet utterly safe is he.\r\n   Was he not safe when the Chinese shots,\r\n   Were flying about his head,\r\n   When trouble thickened with every day,\r\n   And he was sore bestead;\r\n   Was he not safe in his dreary rides,\r\n   Over the desert sands;\r\n   Safe with the Abyssinian King;\r\n   Safe with the robber bands;\r\n   We know not the dangers around him now,\r\n   But this we surely know--\r\n   He has with him in his hour of need,\r\n   His Protector of long ago;\r\n   He is not alone, but a Friend is by\r\n   Who answers to every need;\r\n   God is his refuge and strength at hand,\r\n   Gordon is safe indeed:\r\n   Safe in living, in dying safe, where is the need of pain;\r\n   We may pray--God give the hero long life,\r\n   But death would be infinite gain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"There is a better thing on earth than wealth, a better thing than\r\n   life itself, and that is to have done something before you die, for\r\n   which good men may honour you, and God your Father smile upon your\r\n   work.\"\r\n\r\n   --GEO. MACDONALD.\r\n\r\nThe last Arab messenger that came from Khartoum before it fell, said,\r\n\"Gordon goes every morning at sunrise to the top of his Palace wall, and\r\nwith his large field glass, sweeps the horizon as far as possible, and\r\nnotes as clearly as may be the position of the Madhi's forces, which now\r\nsurrounded the City.  As night falls, he visits the men at their various\r\nstations, to give them advice, or encouragement, as the case might be\r\ndeemed necessary.  In the daytime he studies his maps and reads his\r\nBible, and a work on \"Holy living,\" by Thomas a Kempis, and preserves\r\nsuch a faith in God as inspired all around him with a courage akin to his\r\nown.\r\n\r\n   \"He held the city, he so long\r\n   Faithful mid falterers, mid much weakness strong,\r\n   Upon those ramparts now he fought, he planned,\r\n   That Citadel was by one true man well manned.\"\r\n\r\nA letter from Kitchener reached Gordon, which raised his hopes and\r\nconsiderably brightened his prospects for the time being.  It ran thus:--\r\n\r\n   \"Dear General Gordon.--Mr. Edgerton has asked me to send you the\r\n   following:--'August 30th.  Tell Gordon steamers are being passed over\r\n   the Second Cataracts, and that we wish to be informed through Dongola\r\n   exactly when he expects to be in difficulties as to provision and\r\n   ammunition.'  Message ends--\"Lord Wolseley is coming out to command;\r\n   the 35th regiment is now being sent from Halfa to Dongola.  Sir E.\r\n   Wood is at Halfa, General Earle, Dormer, Buller, and Freemantle are\r\n   coming up the Nile with troops.  I think an expedition will be sent\r\n   across from here to Khartoum, while another goes with steamers to\r\n   Berber.  A few words about what you wish to be done would be\r\n   acceptable.\"\r\n\r\n{Gordon's last slumber: p118.jpg}\r\n\r\nIn Gordon's journal he says:--\"My view is this as to the operations of\r\nBritish forces.  I will put three steamers each with two guns on them,\r\nand an armed force of infantry at the disposal of any British authority;\r\nwill send these steamers to either Methemma opposite Shendy, or to the\r\ncataract below Berber to meet there any British force which may come\r\nacross country to the Nile. . . .  I cannot too much impress upon you\r\nthat this expedition will not encounter any enemy worth the name in a\r\nEuropean sense of the word; the struggle is with the climate and\r\ndestitution of the country.  It is one of time and patience, and of small\r\nparties of determined men backed by native allies, which are to be got by\r\npolicy and money. . . .  It is the country of the irregular, not of the\r\nregular.  If you move in mass you will find no end of difficulties;\r\nwhereas if you let detached parties dash out here and there, you will\r\nspread dismay in the Arab camps.  The time to attack is the dawn, or\r\nrather before it, but sixty men would put the Arabs to flight just before\r\ndawn, while one thousand would not accomplish in daylight.  The reason is\r\nthat the strength of the Arabs is in their horsemen, who do not dare to\r\nact in the dark.  I do hope that you will not drag on the artillery, it\r\nwill only cause delay and do no good.\"\r\n\r\nTo his sister he writes:--\r\n\r\n   _November 5th_, _1884_.\r\n\r\n   \"Your kind letter, August 7th, came yesterday.  We have the Madhi\r\n   close to us, but the Arabs are very quiet. . . . .  Terrible news--I\r\n   hear the steamer I sent down with Stewart, Power, and Herbin (French\r\n   Consul) has been captured and all are killed.  I cannot understand\r\n   it--whether an act of treachery by someone, or struck on a rock, it is\r\n   to me unaccountable, for she was well armed and had a gun with her; if\r\n   she is lost, so is the journal of events from Jan. 3rd, 1884, to Sept.\r\n   10th, 1884.  A huge volume illustrated and full of interest.  I have\r\n   put my steamers at Metemma to wait for the troops.  I am very well but\r\n   very gray, with the continual strain upon my nerves.  I have been\r\n   putting the Sheikh-el-Islam and Cadi in prison; they were suspected of\r\n   writing to the Madhi.  I let them out yesterday.  I am very grieved\r\n   for the relatives of Stewart, Power, and Herbin.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he writes:--\r\n\r\n   _Dec. 14th_, _1884_.\r\n\r\n   \"This may be the last letter you will receive from me, for we are on\r\n   our last legs, owing to the delay of the expedition.  However, God\r\n   rules all, and I know He will rule to His glory and our welfare.  I\r\n   fear that, owing to circumstances, my affairs pecuniarily are not over\r\n   bright.\r\n\r\n   Your affectionate brother,\r\n   C. G. GORDON.\"\r\n\r\n   P.S.--\"I am very happy, thank God, and, like Lawrence, 'I have tried\r\n   to do my duty.'\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Gordon is thus hemmed in.  General Wolseley and his noble band\r\nare on their way to his relief.  Many and peculiar are the difficulties\r\nof both climate, country, and foes; yet they face them like brave, true\r\nEnglishmen.  The journey from Cairo to Ambukol, a distance of more than\r\none thousand miles, had been traversed without serious opposition.  From\r\nhere, however, as they near Khartoum, now about two hundred and fifty\r\nmiles, taking the nearest desert route.  Lord Wolseley seems here to halt\r\nand hesitate, whether it is best to go by the Nile, which, as shown on a\r\nmap, takes a bend, forming the shape of a letter 'S' nearly; or whether\r\nto take the shortest cut and risk the opposition that may be expected.  He\r\neventually decides that the Camel Corps and a portion of the Infantry\r\nshall take the short cut; the desert route to Metemmeh: the rest to go by\r\nthe Nile.  It is evidently Wolseley's wish to punish the tribes who\r\nmurdered Stewart, and his companions; so he orders the South\r\nStaffordshire, 38th, and the Royal Sussex, 35th, and the Black Watch,\r\n42nd, to advance to Abu Hamed, which lies at the northern bend of the\r\n'S,' which the Nile makes between Dongola and Metemmeh.\r\n\r\nThe Camel Corps are ordered to make a dash across the desert to the same\r\nplace.  Little did our force dream of the difficulties, dangers and\r\ndeaths that lay before them as they entered upon that desert march.  We\r\nonly indicate some of them.  On their march we are told that having\r\nnearly reached Abu Klea \"we were turning into our zareba, when it was\r\nnoticed that a group of some two hundred Arabs were on the hills, not far\r\nfrom us.  Two shells were sent amongst them, which caused them to retire,\r\nbut we soon found their sharpshooters had crept to within 1,200 yards of\r\nour right flank.  Also they began to drop bullets into our midst, which\r\nwere annoying and destructive.  Half a company of Mounted Infantry were\r\ntold off to drive them away.  All officers were to see that the men were\r\nat their posts, with bayonets fixed, ready to jump to their feet at the\r\nvery first alarm.  With their overcoats on and their blankets wrapped\r\naround them, men lay down on that memorable night.  All lights put out,\r\nall talking and smoking strictly prohibited.  A deadly stillness,\r\ndisturbed only by the whizzing or thud of the shot from the enemy's guns.\r\nColonel Burnaby, who had managed somehow to find a place in the\r\nExpedition, expressed his great delight in having arrived in time to\r\nengage in what he now saw to be the prospect of a terrible struggle.\r\n\r\nHe stated, \"that he had arrived at that time of life when the two things\r\nthat interested him most were war and politics; and was just as happy in\r\nthe desert fighting the Arabs, as he was at home slating an unworthy\r\npolitician.  Here, however, he was, and must face the conflict.\"  January,\r\n16th, 1885.  About 10 p.m.  The sentries came rushing into the lines.  The\r\nofficers called out, \"stand to your arms men.\"  The alarm, however, was\r\nfalse--only a feint on the part of the enemy.  Still (says the writer),\r\nthey kept harassing us by a continual dropping of shot from their long\r\nrangers.  About 7.30 a.m., General Stewart prepared to send out an\r\nattacking column, with the object of driving them from the wells, which\r\nwere now only four or five miles distant.  The troops marched out--Mounted\r\nInfantry, Royal Artillery with three guns, Guards (this was the Front\r\nFace); Right Face--Guards, Royal Sussex; Left Face--Mounted Infantry,\r\nHeavy Cavalry Regiment.  The 19th Hussars, under Colonel Barrow,\r\nnumbering 90 sabres, were sent to left flank to advance along the spur of\r\nland on the north of the wady.  Their duty was to move forward on a line\r\nparalleled with the Square, and prevent the enemy on our left from\r\ngaining the high ground across the little wady.  A squadron of the 19th,\r\nthirty sabres strong, followed the Square, marching by the front right to\r\nassist the skirmishers.  The Heavies were in charge of Colonel Talbot;\r\nthe Guards by Colonel Boscowen; the Mounted Infantry by Major Barrow; the\r\nNaval Brigade by Lord Charles Beresford; the Royal Sussex by Major\r\nSunderland; the Royal Artillery by Captain Norton; and the Royal\r\nEngineers by Major Dorwood.  So they marched slowly forward.  The\r\nprogress was like that of some ponderous machine, slow, regular, compact,\r\ndespite the hail of bullets that came from front, left and right, and\r\nultimately from the rear.  Some ten or twelve thousand Arabs it was seen\r\nhad surrounded the Zareba.  There was no retreat; it was \"do or die!\"\r\nAbout 9.50 a.m., about 5000 of the enemy were seen on the opposite side\r\nof the square, 400 or 500 yards distant, and seemed as if they would make\r\na dash for our square.  Dervishes on horseback, and some on foot,\r\nmarshalled them, standing a few paces in front of the frantic host.  With\r\nbanners fluttering, tom-toms clamouring, and shouts of Allah, they began\r\nto move towards our square.  The skirmisher's fire seemed to have no\r\neffect; though a few of them fell, they ultimately made a run towards us\r\nlike the roll of a black surf.  Lord Charles Beresford's superintendence\r\nwas moved to the left face, rear corner, to be brought into action; for\r\nhere they seemed to press the attack.  Unhappily, before many rounds had\r\nbeen fired, the cartridges stuck and the weapon was useless.  Still down\r\ncame the Arab wave.  One terrible rush of swordsmen and spearmen--scarcely\r\nany carrying guns--their rifle fire had practically ceased.  In wild\r\nexcitement, their white teeth glistening and the sheen of their\r\nbrandished weapons flashing like thousands of mirrors; onward they came\r\nagainst us.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer says:--\"A volley of shot was sent into them at 150 yards; at\r\nleast one hundred Arabs fell, and their force wavered, as a man stops to\r\nget his breath; but the forces behind them came leaping over their\r\nfalling brethren, and came charging straight into our ranks.  I was at\r\nthat instant inside the square, when I noticed our men shuffling\r\nbackwards.  Some say Colonel Burnaby issued an order for the men to fall\r\nback, but I did not hear it.  Burnaby rode out apparently to assist our\r\nskirmishers, who were running in, hard pressed: all but one succeeding in\r\ngetting inside the square: Burnaby went, sword in hand, on his borrowed\r\nnag, for his own had been shot under him that morning--he put himself in\r\nthe way of a Sheik who was charging down on horseback.  Ere the Arab\r\nclosed with him a bullet from some in our ranks brought the Sheik\r\nheadlong to the ground.  The enemy's spearmen were close behind, and one\r\nof them clashed at Colonel Burnaby, pointing the long blade of his spear\r\nat his throat.  Burnaby leant forward in his saddle and parried the\r\nMoslem's thrusts; but the length of the weapon (8 feet or more) made it\r\ndifficult to deal a blow as desired.  Once or twice the Colonel managed\r\nto touch him.  This only made him the more alert.  Burnaby fenced\r\nsmartly, just as if he was playing in an assault-at-arms, and there was a\r\nsmile on his features as he drove off the man's awkward points.  With\r\nthat lightning instinct which I have seen the desert warrior display in\r\nbattle, whilst coming to another's aid, an Arab who had been pursuing a\r\nsoldier, passed five paces to Burnaby's right and rear, and, turning with\r\na sudden spring, this second Arab ran his spear point into the Colonel's\r\nright shoulder!  It was but a slight wound, enough though to cause\r\nBurnaby to twist round in his saddle to defend himself from this\r\nunexpected attack.  One of our soldiers saw the situation, and ran and\r\ndrove his sword bayonet through this second assailant.  As the soldier\r\nwithdrew his steel the ferocious Arab wriggled round and tried to reach\r\nhim.  This he could not do, for he reeled and fell over.  Brief as was\r\nBurnaby's glance at this second assailant, it was long enough for the\r\nfirst Arab to deliver his spear-point thrust full in the brave officer's\r\nthroat.  The blow brought Burnaby out of his saddle; but it required some\r\nseconds before he let go of the bridle-reins, and tumbled upon the\r\nground.  Half-a-dozen Arabs were now about him.  With the blood gushing\r\nin streams from his gashed throat the dauntless Burnaby leaped to his\r\nfeet, sword in hand, and slashed at the ferocious group.  They were the\r\nwild shrieks of a proud man dying hard, and he was quickly overborne, and\r\nleft helpless and dying!  The heroic soldier who sprang to his rescue,\r\nwas, I fear, also slain in the melee, for though I watched for him, I\r\nnever saw him get back to his place in the ranks.                 But the\r\nsquare had been broken.  The Arabs were driving their spears at our men's\r\nbreasts.  Happily, however, the enemy's ranks had been badly decimated by\r\nour bullets; yet they fought desperately, until bullet or bayonet stopped\r\ntheir career.  Then from another quarter came a great onrush with spears\r\npoised and swords uplifted straight into our rear corner, the Arab horse\r\nstruck like a tempest.  The Heavies were thrown into confusion, for the\r\nenemy were right among them, killing and wounding with demoniacal fury.\r\nGeneral Stewart himself rode into their midst to assist, but his horse\r\nwas killed under him, and he was saved from the Arab spearmen with great\r\ndifficulty: Lord Airlie received two slight spear wounds, and so did Lord\r\nC. Beresford.  The Dervishes made terrible havoc for a few minutes.  It\r\nwas an awful scene, for many of the wounded and dying perished by the\r\nhands of the merciless Arabs, infuriated by their Sheiks, whose wild\r\nhoarse cries rent the air, whilst the black spearmen ran hither and\r\nthither thirsting for blood.  Lord St. Vincent had a most providential\r\nescape.  So great was the peril that the officers in the Guards and\r\nMounted Infantry placed their men back to back to make one last effort to\r\nsave the situation.  \"To me,\" says the writer, who was outside on the\r\nright face: \"they appeared to spin round a large mound like a whirlpool\r\nof human beings.\"\r\n\r\nSoon the enemy showed signs of wavering, for the fire of our English lads\r\nwas fierce and withering.  A young officer rallied a number of men on the\r\nrear; and these delivered a most telling fire into the enemy's ranks; the\r\nstrained tension of the situation had been most severe, when at last the\r\nArabs, two or three at first, then twenties and fifties, trotted off the\r\nfield and in a very few minutes there was not an enemy to be seen.  With\r\ncheer upon cheer, shouting until we were hoarse, we celebrated this\r\ndearly won victory.  \"Thus ended one of several terrible conflicts the\r\nmen of the Expedition had to go through on their way to the beleaguered\r\ncity.\"  These lines of poetry, were written shortly after the news of\r\nthis fierce engagement reached England:--\r\n\r\n   \"They were gathered on the desert,\r\n   Like pebbles on the shore,\r\n   And they rushed upon the Christian\r\n   With a shout like cannon's roar;\r\n   Like the dashing of the torrent,\r\n   Like the sweeping of the storm,\r\n   Like the raging of the tempest,\r\n   Came down the dusky swarm.\r\n   From the scant and struggling brush-wood,\r\n   From the waste of burning sand,\r\n   Sped the warriors of the desert,\r\n   Like the locusts of the land:\r\n   They would crush the bold invader,\r\n   Who had dared to cross their path;\r\n   They were fighting for their prophet,\r\n   In the might of Islam's wrath,\r\n   They were savage in their fury,\r\n   They were lordly in their pride;\r\n   There was glory for the victor,\r\n   And heaven for him who died.\r\n   They were mustered close together,\r\n   That small devoted band;\r\n   They knew the strife that day would rage\r\n   In combat hand to hand.\r\n   And wild and weird the battle-cry\r\n   Was sounding through the air,\r\n   As the foe sprang from his ambush,\r\n   Like the tiger from his lair.\r\n   They knew the distant flashing\r\n   Of the bright Arabian spear,\r\n   As, spurring madly onward,\r\n   They saw the host appear\r\n   In numbers overwhelming,\r\n   In numbers ten to one;\r\n   They knew the conflict must be waged\r\n   Beneath the scorching sun;\r\n   They knew the British soldiers grave\r\n   Might lie beneath their feet;\r\n   But they never knew dishonour,\r\n   And they would not know defeat.\r\n   And swifter, ever swifter\r\n   Swept on the savage horde,\r\n   And from the serried British ranks\r\n   A murderous fire was poured;\r\n   And like the leaves in autumn\r\n   Fell Arab warriors slain,\r\n   And like the leaves in spring-time\r\n   They seemed to live again.\r\n   Midst the rattle of the bullets,\r\n   Midst the flashing of the steel,\r\n   They pressed to the encounter\r\n   With fierce fanatic zeal.\r\n   One moment swayed the phalanx,\r\n   One moment and no more;\r\n   Then British valour stemmed the tide,\r\n   As oft in days of yore.\r\n   At length the foe was vanquished,\r\n   And at length the field was won,\r\n   For the longest day had ended,\r\n   And the fiercest course was run.\r\n   Ye smiling plains of Albion!\r\n   Ye mountains of the north!\r\n   Now up and greet your heroes with\r\n   The honours they are worth.\r\n   Then pause and let a nation's tears\r\n   Fall gently on the sod\r\n   Where thy gallant sons are sleeping,\r\n   Whose souls are with their God.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Burleigh tells us that \"History records no military events of a more\r\nstirring character, or situation more thrilling and dramatic than those\r\nthrough which Sir Herbert Stewart's flying column passed on this dreadful\r\nmarch.  Through those terrible struggles with the followers of the Madhi,\r\nmany a brave soldier fell and his body lies in the grave of the African\r\ndesert.  It did, however, seem as if through all the difficulties of the\r\nrelieving forces, that Lord Wolseley would soon give the gallant defender\r\nof Khartoum succour and relief.  The splendid victories won at Abu Klea\r\nWells, and other places, and their march to join the Nile forces, clearly\r\nshowed that they were terribly in earnest, and that they had the true\r\nBritish sympathetic heart.\r\n\r\nFinding some of Gordon's steamers on the Nile, it was their first impulse\r\nto man them and force their way up to Khartoum at once.  This was on\r\nJanuary 21st, 1885.  The General in Command learned that the steamers\r\nneeded some repairs, and he (Sir Charles Wilson) deemed it necessary for\r\nthe safety of his troops to make a reconnaissance down the river towards\r\nBerber before starting up to Khartoum.  He took the steamers, which,\r\nthough small as the Thames pleasure boats, had been made bullet-proof by\r\nthe ingenuity and industry of the hero in distress; and with a small\r\nBritish force and two hundred and forty Soudanese (they also had in tow a\r\nnugger laden with dhura), they proceeded towards Berber some distance,\r\nand then, returning for their important work of relief, they pressed on\r\nto Khartoum in the face of the greatest dangers from the numerous\r\nfanatical Arabs, until they could see the city, and found to their horror\r\nand disappointment that Gordon's flag was torn down.  The city had\r\nsurrendered to the forces of the Madhi, and it could be seen to swarm\r\nwith his followers!  Treachery had been at work, as Gordon feared; and\r\nthe brave defender of Khartoum sealed his fidelity with his own blood.  We\r\nnever doubted but he would \"die at his post.\"\r\n\r\nThe Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone was on a visit to Holker Hall to see the\r\nDuke of Devonshire, when the sad tale was told of Gordon's betrayal and\r\ndeath.  To add to the grief, the Queen, whose inmost soul had been\r\nstirred by the terrible news, sent to Mr. Gladstone and Lord Hartington a\r\ntelegram couched in terms of anger and of blame, and this, not in cypher\r\nas was her wont, but plain and open.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone addressed to Her Majesty by return, in the most courteous\r\nmanner possible, what may be considered a vindication of his actions in\r\nthe matter and also that of his Cabinet:--\r\n\r\n   \"To the Queen,--\r\n\r\n   \"Mr. Gladstone has had the honour this day to receive your Majesty's\r\n   telegram, _en clair_, relating to the deplorable intelligence received\r\n   this day from Lord Wolseley, and stating that it is too fearful to\r\n   consider that the fall of Khartoum might have been prevented and many\r\n   precious lives saved by earlier action.  Mr. Gladstone does not\r\n   presume to estimate the means of judgment possessed by your Majesty,\r\n   but so far as his information and recollection at the moment go, he is\r\n   not altogether able to follow the conclusion which your Majesty has\r\n   been pleased thus to announce.  Mr. Gladstone is under the impression\r\n   that Lord Wolseley's force might have been sufficiently advanced to\r\n   save Khartoum, had not a large portion of it been detached by a\r\n   circuitous route along the river, upon the express application of\r\n   General Gordon, to occupy Berber on the way to the final destination.\r\n   He speaks, however, with submission on a point of this kind.  There\r\n   is, indeed, in some quarters, a belief that the river route ought to\r\n   have been chosen at an earlier period, and had the navigation of the\r\n   Nile, in its upper region, been as well known as that of the Thames,\r\n   this might have been a just ground of reproach.  But when, on the\r\n   first symptoms that the position of General Gordon in Khartoum was not\r\n   secure, your Majesty's advisers at once sought from the most competent\r\n   persons the best information they could obtain respecting the Nile\r\n   route, the balance of testimony and authority was decidedly against\r\n   it, and the idea of the Suakin and Berber route, with all its\r\n   formidable difficulties, was entertained in preference; nor was it\r\n   till a much later period that the weight of opinion and information\r\n   warranted the definite choice of the Nile route.  Your Majesty's\r\n   Ministers were well aware that climate and distance were far more\r\n   formidable than the sword of the enemy, and they deemed it right,\r\n   while providing adequate military means, never to lose from view what\r\n   might have proved to be the destruction of the gallant army in the\r\n   Soudan.  It is probable that abundant wrath and indignation will on\r\n   this occasion be poured out upon them.  Nor will they complain if so\r\n   it should be; but a partial consolation may be found on reflecting\r\n   that neither aggressive policy, nor military disaster, nor any gross\r\n   error in the application of means to ends, has marked this series of\r\n   difficult proceedings, which, indeed, have greatly redounded to the\r\n   honour of your Majesty's forces of all ranks and arms.  In these\r\n   remarks, which Mr. Gladstone submits with his humble devotion, he has\r\n   taken it for granted that Khartoum has fallen through the exhaustion\r\n   of its means of defence.  But your Majesty may observe from the\r\n   telegram that this is uncertain.  Both the correspondent's account and\r\n   that of Major Wortley refer to the delivery of the town by treachery,\r\n   a contingency which on some previous occasions General Gordon has\r\n   treated as far from improbable; and which, if the notice existed, was\r\n   likely to operate quite independently of the particular time at which\r\n   a relieving force might arrive.  The presence of the enemy in force\r\n   would naturally suggest the occasion or perhaps even the apprehension\r\n   of the approach of the British army.  In pointing to these\r\n   considerations, Mr. Gladstone is far from assuming that they are\r\n   conclusive upon the whole case; in dealing with which the government\r\n   has hardly ever at any of its stages been furnished sufficiently with\r\n   those means of judgment which rational men usually require.  It may be\r\n   that, on a retrospect, many errors will appear to have been committed.\r\n   There are many reproaches, from the most opposite quarters, to which\r\n   it might be difficult to supply a conclusive answer.  Among them, and\r\n   perhaps amongst the most difficult, as far as Mr. Gladstone can judge,\r\n   would be the reproach of those who might argue that our proper\r\n   business was the protection of Egypt, that it never was in military\r\n   danger from the Madhi, and that the most prudent course would have\r\n   been to provide it with adequate frontier defences, and to assume no\r\n   responsibility for the lands beyond the desert.\"\r\n\r\n   \"Heroes have fought, and warriors bled,\r\n   For home, and love, and glory;\r\n   Your life and mine will soon be sped,\r\n   Then what will be the story?\"\r\n\r\n   --J. RUSHTON.\r\n\r\nThe agonizing suspense in which our nation had been kept for weeks, was\r\nnow at an end, and we learned the worst.  The news fell like a\r\nthunderbolt upon our country!  Within forty-eight hours of the time when\r\nGordon would have heard the triumph ranting of English cheers, and once\r\nmore clasped the faithful hands of British brother soldiers; treachery\r\nhad done its worst.  Thus ended this unique life's drama of one of the\r\nnoblest hearts that ever beat in soldier's bosom, and one of the truest\r\nto his Queen, to his country, and to his God.  The heart that had caused\r\nhim to share his home with the homeless, and his bread with the hungry,\r\nthat had led him to kneel in prayer by the dying; the heart that had so\r\noften throbbed for the misery of slavery, and the slave trade, as to risk\r\nhis life as of no value to stop that cursed practice and traffic; that\r\nheart was pierced by the treacherous hands (in all probability) of the\r\nvery man Gordon had made the greatest sacrifice to save.  Such terrible\r\nnews threw our land into universal mourning, and thousands wept for the\r\nhero that would never return.\r\n\r\nThe military correspondent of the \"Daily News\" at Dongola, writes: \"Two\r\nmen arrived here yesterday, April 11th, 1885, whose story throws some\r\nlight on the capture of Khartoum.  They were soldiers in Gordon's army,\r\ntaken at the time and sold as slaves, but who ultimately escaped.  Their\r\nnames are Said Abdullah and Jacoob Mahomet.  I will let them tell their\r\nown history.\"  \"After stating they were first taken at Omdurman,\r\nsubsequently to the capture of Khartoum; were then stolen by arabs and\r\nsold to two Kabbabish merchants, and afterwards escaped from Aboudom to\r\nDebbah, from which place they had reached Dongola; they went on to relate\r\nthe doings of Farig Pasha previously to the taking of Khartoum.  I have\r\ngiven you some account of the story by telegraph, and it has been partly\r\nmade familiar substantially through other channels.  They continued:\r\n\"That night Khartoum was delivered into the hands of the rebels.  It fell\r\nthrough the treachery of the accursed Farig Pasha, the Circassian, who\r\nopened the gate.  May he never reach Paradise!  May Shaytan take\r\npossession of his soul!  But it was Kismet.  The gate was called Bouri';\r\nit was on the Blue Nile.  We were on guard near, but did not see what was\r\ngoing on.  We were attacked and fought desperately at the gate.  Twelve\r\nof our staff were killed, and twenty-two of us retreated to a high room,\r\nwhere we were taken prisoners, and now came the ending.  The red Flag\r\nwith the crescent was destined no more to wave over the Palace; nor would\r\nthe strains of the hymns of His Excellency be heard any more at eventide\r\nin Khartoum.  Blood was to flow in her streets, in her dwellings, in her\r\nvery mosque, and on the Kenniseh of the Narsira.  A cry arose, \"To the\r\nPalace! to the Palace!\"  A wild and furious band rushed towards it, but\r\nthey were resisted by the black troops, who fought desperately.  They\r\nknew there was no mercy for them, and that even were their lives spared,\r\nthey would be enslaved, and the state of the slave, the perpetual bondage\r\nwith hard taskmasters, is worse than death.  Slaves are not treated well,\r\nas you think; heavy chains are round their ankles and middle, and they\r\nare lashed for the least offence until blood flows.  We had fought for\r\nthe Christian Pasha and for the Turks, and we knew that we should receive\r\nno mercy.  The house was set on fire: the fight raged and the slaughter\r\ncontinued till the streets were slippery with blood.  The rebels rushed\r\nonward to the Palace.  We saw a mass rolling to and fro, but did not see\r\nGordon Pasha killed.  He met his fate, we believe, as he was leaving the\r\nPalace, near the large tree which stands on the esplanade.  The Palace is\r\nnot a stone's throw, or at any rate a gun shot distance from the Austrian\r\nConsul's house.  He was going in that direction, to the magazine on the\r\nKenniseh, a long way off.  We did not hear what became of his body, nor\r\ndid we hear that his head was cut off; but we saw the head of the traitor\r\nFarig Pasha, who met with his deserts.  We have heard it was the blacks\r\nthat ran away; and that the Egyptian soldiers fought well; that is not\r\ntrue, they were craven.  Had it not been for them, in spite of the\r\ntreachery of many within the town, the Arabs would not have got in, for\r\nwe watched the traitors.  And now fearful scenes took place in every\r\nhouse and building, in the large Market Place, in the small bazaars; men\r\nwere slain crying for mercy, but mercy was not in the hearts of those\r\nsavage enemies.  Women and children were robbed of their jewels of\r\nsilver, of their bracelets, necklaces of precious stones, and carried off\r\nto be sold to the Bishareen merchants as slaves.  Yes, and white women\r\ntoo, mother and daughter alike were carried off from their homes of\r\ncomfort.  Wives and children of Egyptian merchants, formerly rich, owning\r\nships and mills; these were sold afterwards, some for 340 thaleries or\r\nmore, some for 25, according to age and good looks.  And the poor black\r\nwomen already slaves, and their children, 70 or 80 thaleries.  Their\r\nhusbands and masters were slain before their eyes . . . . this fighting\r\nand spilling of blood continued till noon, till the sun rode high in the\r\nsky.  There was riot, wrangling, hubbub and cursing, till the hour of\r\nevening prayer.  But the Muezzin was not called, neither were any prayers\r\noffered up at the Moslem Mosque on that dark day in the annals of\r\nKhartoum.  Meanwhile the screeching devils bespattered with gore,\r\nswarming about in droves and bands, found very little plunder, so were\r\ndisappointed, and sought out Farig Pasha, and found him with the\r\nDervishes.  'Where is the hidden treasure?' they at once demanded of him.\r\n'We know that you are acquainted with the hiding place.  Where is the\r\nmoney and riches of the city and its merchants?  We know that those who\r\nleft Khartoum did not take away their valuables, and you know where it is\r\nhid.'  The Dervishes seeing the tumult questioned him sharply, and\r\naddressed him thus: \"The long expected one our Lord, desires to know\r\nwhere the English Pasha hid his wealth.  We know he was very rich, and\r\nevery day paid large sums of money; that has not been concealed from our\r\nLord.  Now therefore let us know that we may bear him word where all the\r\nmoney is hidden.  Let him be bound in the inner chamber and examined; and\r\nthe gates closed against the Arabs.\"  Farig was then questioned, but he\r\n\"swore by Allah and by the souls of his fathers back to three\r\ngenerations, that Gordon had no money, and that he knew of no hidden\r\ntreasure.\"  \"You lie (cried the Dervishes); you wish after a while to\r\ncome and dig it out yourself.  Listen to what we are going to say to you.\r\nWe are sure you know where the money is hidden.  We are not careful of\r\nyour life, for you have betrayed the man whose salt you had eaten; you\r\nhave been the servant of the infidel, and you have betrayed even him.\r\nUnless you unfold this secret of the buried treasure, you will surely\r\ndie.\"  Farig with proud bearing said, \"I care not for your threats.  I\r\nhave told you the truth, Allah knows.  There is no money, neither is\r\nthere treasure.  You are fools to suppose there is.  I have done a great\r\ndeed, I have delivered to your lord and master (the Madhi), the city\r\nwhich you never could have taken without my help.  I tell you again there\r\nis no treasure, and you will rue the day if you kill me.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the Dervishes then stepped forward and struck him, bound as he\r\nwas, in the mouth; then another rushed at him with his two-edged sword,\r\nstruck him behind the neck so that with this one blow his head fell from\r\nhis shoulders; (so perished the arch traitor); may his soul be afflicted!\r\nBut as for Gordon Pasha the magnanimous, may his soul have peace!\"  The\r\nstory of these men may, or may not be true, but it seems on the face of\r\nit trustworthy.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, out of harmony with the description given of Gordon's\r\ndeath by Slatin Pasha, who was taken a prisoner at the time of the fall\r\nof Khartoum, and had been kept for eleven years in captivity, but\r\neventually made his escape.  He was in attendance at the International\r\nGeographical Congress held at the Imperial Institute, and devoted to\r\nAfrican affairs, when he told the story of his escape from Khartoum.  He\r\nsays \"The City of Khartoum fell on the 16th Jan., 1885, and Gordon was\r\nkilled on the highest step of the staircase of his Palace.  His head was\r\ncut off and exhibited to Slatin whilst the latter was in chains, with\r\nexpressions of derision and contempt.\"\r\n\r\nWe have no doubt now as to the fact that Gordon Pasha, the illustrious,\r\nthe saintly, the brave defender, died doing his duty.  In all civilized\r\nlands there are still men who tell of Gordon Pasha's unbounded\r\nbenevolence; of his mighty faith, of his heroism and self-sacrifice, and\r\nthey mourn with us the loss of one of the most saintly souls our world\r\nhas ever known.\r\n\r\n   \"Warrior of God, man's friend, not laid below,\r\n      But somewhere dead far in the waste Soudan,\r\n   Thou livest in all hearts, for all men know\r\n      This earth hath borne no simpler, nobler man.\"\r\n\r\n   TENNYSON.\r\n\r\nA most interesting and exquisitely touching letter was forwarded to the\r\nbereaved and stricken sister of our hero from the Khedive of Egypt,\r\nwritten from\r\n\r\n   \"ABDUI PALACE,\r\n   \"CAIRO,\r\n   \"FEB. 24, 1885.\r\n\r\n   \"MADAM,--\r\n\r\n   \"Altho' I do not wish to intrude upon the great sorrow which has\r\n   fallen upon you in the death of your distinguished brother, the late\r\n   General Gordon Pasha, yet as Egypt and myself have so much reason to\r\n   deplore his loss, I desire to convey to you my heart-felt sympathy in\r\n   the terrible bereavement it has been God's will you should suffer.  I\r\n   cannot find words to express to you the respect and admiration with\r\n   which your brother's simple faith and heroic courage have inspired me:\r\n   the whole world resounds with the name of the Englishman whose\r\n   chivalrous nature afforded it for many years its brightest and most\r\n   powerful example,--an example which I believe will influence thousands\r\n   of persons for good through all time.  To a man of Gordon's character\r\n   the disappointment of hopes he deemed so near fruition, and the sudden\r\n   manner of his death were of little importance.  In his own words, he\r\n   left weariness for perfect rest.  Our mourning for him is true and\r\n   real; as is also our loss, but we have a sure hope that a life and\r\n   death such as his are not extinguished by what we call death.  I beg\r\n   to renew to you, Madam, the assurance of my sincere sympathy and\r\n   respectful condolence.\r\n\r\n\"MEHEMIT TEWFIK.\"\r\n\r\nAlso from the Queen, a letter full of womanly and queenly sympathy is\r\nhere recorded from _The Daily News_:\r\n\r\n   \"DEAR MISS GORDON,--How shall I write to you, or how shall I attempt\r\n   to express what I feel?  To think of your dear, noble, heroic brother,\r\n   who served his country and his Queen so truly, so heroically, with a\r\n   self-sacrifice so edifying to the world, not having been rescued: that\r\n   the promises of support were not fulfilled--which I so frequently and\r\n   constantly pressed on those who asked him to go--is to me grief\r\n   inexpressible: indeed it has made me ill.  My heart bleeds for you,\r\n   his sister, who have gone through so many anxieties on his account,\r\n   and who loved the dear brother as he deserved to be.  You are all so\r\n   good and trustful, and have such strong faith, that you will be\r\n   sustained even now, when real absolute evidence of your brother's\r\n   death does not exist--but I fear there cannot be much doubt of it.\r\n   Some day I hope to see you again to tell you all I cannot express.  My\r\n   daughter Beatrice, who has felt quite as I do, wishes me to express\r\n   her deepest sympathy with you.  I hear so many expressions of sorrow\r\n   from abroad; from my eldest daughter The Crown Princess, and from my\r\n   cousin the King of the Belgians--the very warmest.  Would you express\r\n   to your other sister, and your elder brother my true sympathy, and\r\n   what I do so keenly feel, the stain left upon England for your dear\r\n   brother's cruel, though heroic fate!  Ever, dear Miss Gordon, yours\r\n   sincerely and sympathizingly,\r\n\r\n   V.R.I.\"\r\n\r\nA second letter from Her Majesty the Queen to acknowledge Miss Gordon's\r\ngift of her brother's Bible.  The very Bible he used when with me in\r\nManchester.  His companion at Gravesend, and during his sojourn in the\r\nSoudan (first time).  \"It was so worn out (says Miss Gordon) that he gave\r\nit to me.  Hearing that the Queen would like to see it, I forwarded it to\r\nWindsor Castle.\"  And this Bible is now placed in an enamel and crystal\r\ncase called \"The St. George's Casket,\" where it now lies open on a white\r\nsatin cushion, with a marble bust of General Gordon on a pedestal beside\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty writes:--\r\n\r\n   \"WINDSOR CASTLE,\r\n   \"MARCH 16TH, 1885.\r\n\r\n   \"DEAR MISS GORDON,--It is most kind and good of you to give me this\r\n   precious Bible, and I only hope that you are not depriving yourself\r\n   and family of such a treasure, if you have no other.  May I ask you,\r\n   during how many years your dear, heroic brother had it with him?  I\r\n   shall have a case made for it with an inscription, and place it in the\r\n   library here, with your letter and the touching extract from his last\r\n   to you.  I have ordered, as you know, a Marble Bust of your Dear\r\n   Brother to be placed in the corridor here, where so many busts and\r\n   pictures of our greatest Generals, and Statesmen are, and hope that\r\n   you will see it before it is finished, to give your opinion as to the\r\n   likeness.--Believe me always yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\n   \"VICTORIA R.I.\"\r\n\r\nA most touching and I think true epitaph has been written in Greek and\r\ntranslated by Professor Jebb, of the University of Glasgow touching the\r\ndeath of General Gordon:--\r\n\r\n   \"Leaving a perpetual remembrance, thou art gone; in thy death thou\r\n   wert even such as in thy life; wealth to the poor, hope to the\r\n   desponding, support to the weak.  Thou couldst meet desperate troubles\r\n   with a spirit that knew not despair, and breathe might into the\r\n   trembling.  The Lord of China owes thee thanks for thy benefits; the\r\n   throne of his ancient kingdom hath not been cast down.  And where the\r\n   Nile unites the divided strength of his streams, a city saw thee long-\r\n   suffering.  A multitude dwelt therein, but thine alone was the valour\r\n   that guarded it through all that year, when by day and by night thou\r\n   didst keep watch against the host of the Arabians, who went around it\r\n   to devour it, with spears thirsting for blood.  Thy death was not\r\n   wrought by the God of war, but by the frailties of thy friends.  For\r\n   thy country and for all men God blessed the work of thy hand.  Hail,\r\n   stainless warrior! hail, thrice victorious hero!  Thou livest and\r\n   shalt teach aftertimes to reverence the council of the Everlasting\r\n   Father.\"\r\n\r\nShould he have been spared to return to our land--\r\n\r\n   \"We had the laurels ready\r\n   That patient brow to crown,\r\n   But the traitors steel was swift and sharp\r\n   To strike our honours down.\r\n   God His own victor crowneth,\r\n   He counts not gain nor loss,\r\n   For the dauntless heart that battles\r\n   'Neath the shadow of the Cross.\r\n   Rest for the gallant soldier,\r\n   Where'er he lieth low,\r\n   His rest is still and deep to-day,\r\n   'Mid clash of friend and foe.\r\n   He stands amid the light he loved,\r\n   Whence all the clouds depart,\r\n   But there's a gap within our ranks,\r\n   And a void within our hearts.\"\r\n\r\nGreat men are usually measured by their character, not by their\r\nsuccesses; but measured by either standard Gordon must be considered a\r\n_great_ man.  In him were incarnated all the highest characteristics of\r\nthe heroes of our land, and other lands, and of the illustrious servants\r\nof God in all ages.  His life was swayed by a noble purpose, and by this\r\nhe was borne onward and upward in a career of noble doing and daring.  He\r\nhad courage of the very highest quality, and by this he carved his way\r\ninto the very front rank of our heroes, and won remarkable distinctions\r\nin life's fiercest battles.  His crowning characteristics were, I think,\r\nhis genuineness, and unfailing trust in God.  These, especially the\r\nlatter, were the inspiration of his life; and these alone offer the\r\ntruest explanation of his heroic deeds.  Even in Spain his name had a\r\nfragrance that was attractive and beautiful.  One of the papers _The El\r\nDia_, of Madrid, wrote: \"Where even the greatest events which occur\r\nabroad hardly attract the attention of the general public, the daring\r\nenterprises of General Gordon had excited the greatest interest.  This\r\nwas partly because of the immense importance of the drama which was being\r\nplayed in the Soudan, and because of the extraordinary development of the\r\ndrama; but it was chiefly due to the sympathy of the people with the\r\nheroic champion of light and civilization; for his spotless honesty; for\r\nhis valour, tried times without number; for his British tenacity; for his\r\nfaith in his religion and country; for his keen insight; for his heroic\r\nunselfishness, and for all his other fine qualities.  Gordon has become\r\nrecognised in Spain as an original character, grand and complete, whom\r\nfuture generations will idealize, and whom history will call by the name\r\nof genius.\"\r\n\r\nBut Gordon, the great soldier and loveable Saint is dead; and he himself\r\ncould wish no nobler ending of an unselfish life, after such a life of\r\nadventure, of heroism, and of humble trust in God.\r\n\r\nA combination of strange, rare qualities helped to make him one of the\r\nmost remarkable men our country has ever seen.  As a Christian of rarest\r\npurity and consecration, and as a hero whose fame has filled two\r\nhemispheres, \"His name shall be had in everlasting remembrance.\"  He has\r\nadded new chapters to the glorious stories of British pluck and heroism,\r\nand has left a name to which our young men will look back upon with\r\npride; and the best of us will reverence, so long as truth, faith, self-\r\ndevotion, and lofty sense of duty stir the admiration of men who are\r\nworthy to be called his fellow-countrymen.  Our British nation thrills\r\nwith a proud joy as it reflects upon the splendid achievements of that\r\nstainless life, now crowned with the laurels of martyrdom, and of an\r\nEmpire's love.\r\n\r\nThe memorial in St. Paul's Cathedral most beautifully sets forth the\r\nleading traits in his character:--\r\n\r\n   \"Major General Charles George Gordon, C.B., who at all times and\r\n   everywhere, gave his strength to the weak, his substance to the poor,\r\n   his sympathy to the suffering, his heart to God.\r\n\r\n   \"Born at Woolwich, 28th Jan., 1838.\r\n\r\n   \"Slain at Khartoum, 26th Jan., 1885.\r\n\r\n   \"He saved an Empire by his warlike genius, he ruled vast provinces\r\n   with justice, wisdom, power.  And lastly, obedient to his Sovereign's\r\n   command, he died in the heroic attempt to save men, women and children\r\n   from imminent and deadly peril.  'Greater love hath no man than this,\r\n   that a man lay down his life for his friends.'--St. John, xv. ch., v.\r\n   13.\r\n\r\n{The Memorial in St. Paul's Cathedral: p155.jpg}\r\n\r\n   \"This monument is erected by his only surviving brother, whose eldest\r\n   son also perished in the service of his country, as Midshipman in\r\n   H.M.S. 'Captain,' and is commemorated with others in the adjoining\r\n   recess.\"\r\n\r\n      \"Gordon! thou lost ideal of our time,\r\n   While men believe not, and belief grows pale,\r\n   Before the daring doubters that assail;\r\n   We need thy child-like faith, thy gaze sublime,\r\n      That pierced the nearer gloom,\r\n      And still onward strode\r\n   Through death and darkness, seeing only God.\"\r\n\r\n   \"Servant of Christ, well done,\r\n      Praise be thy new employ;\r\n   And while eternal ages run,\r\n      Rest in thy Saviour's joy.\"\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes.\r\n\r\n\r\n{57}  A work by the Rev. Wm. Arthur, which Gordon presented to me.\r\n\r\n{63}  The name of our Ragged School.",
