Before the\r\nrecollection of their quaint ways, their curious manners and customs,\r\nhas quite passed away, it has been thought advisable to collect all that\r\ncan be gathered together concerning them. Much light has in recent years\r\nbeen thrown upon the history of the office. The learned notes appended\r\nto Dr. Wickham Legg's edition of _The Parish Clerk's Book_, published by\r\nthe Henry Bradshaw Society, Dr. Atchley's _Parish Clerk and his Right to\r\nRead the Liturgical Epistle_ (Alcuin Club Tracts), and other works, give\r\nmuch information with regard to the antiquity of the office, and to the\r\nduties of the clerk of mediæval times; and from these books I have\r\nderived much information. By the kindness of many friends and of many\r\ncorrespondents who are personally unknown to me, I have been enabled to\r\ncollect a large number of anecdotes, recollections, facts, and\r\nbiographical sketches of many clerks in different parts of England, and\r\nI am greatly indebted to those who have so kindly supplied me with so\r\nmuch valuable information. Many of the writers are far advanced in\r\nyears, when the labour of putting pen to paper is a sore burden. I am\r\ndeeply grateful to them for the trouble which they kindly took in\r\nrecording their recollections of the scenes of their youth. I have been\r\nmuch amused by the humorous stories of old clerkly ways, by the\r\n_facetiæ_ which have been sent to me, and I have been much impressed by\r\nthe records of faithful service and devotion to duty shown by many\r\nholders of the office who won the esteem and affectionate regard of both\r\npriest and people. It is impossible for me to publish the names of all\r\nthose who have kindly written to me, but I wish especially to thank the\r\nRev. Canon Venables, who first suggested the idea of this work, and to\r\nwhom it owes its conception and initiation[1]; to the Rev. B.D.\r\nBlyn-Stoyle, to Mr. F.W. Hackwood, the Rev. W.V. Vickers, the Rev. W.\r\nSelwyn, the Rev. E.H. L. Reeve, the Rev. W.H. Langhorne, Mr. E.J.\r\nLupson, Mr. Charles Wise, and many others, who have taken a kindly\r\ninterest in the writing of this book. I have also to express my thanks\r\nto the editors of the _Treasury_ and of _Pearson's Magazine_ for\r\npermission to reproduce portions of some of the articles which I\r\ncontributed to their periodicals, to the editor of _Chambers's Journal_\r\nfor the use of an article on some north-country clerics and their clerks\r\nby a writer whose name is unknown to me, and to the Rev. J. Gaskell\r\nExton for sending to me an account of a Yorkshire clerk which, by the\r\nkindness of the editor of the _Yorkshire Weekly Post_, I am enabled to\r\nreproduce.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Since the above was written, and while this book has been\r\npassing through the press, the venerable clergyman, Canon Venables, has\r\nbeen called away from earth. A zealous parish priest, a voluminous\r\nwriter, a true friend, he will be much missed by all who knew him. Some\r\nmonths ago he sent me some recollections of his early days, of the\r\nclerks he had known, and his reflections on his long ministry, and these\r\nhave been recorded in this book, and will now have a pathetic interest\r\nfor his many friends and for all who admired his noble, earnest, and\r\nstrenuous life.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PARISH CLERK\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nOLD-TIME CHOIRS AND PARSONS\r\n\r\nA remarkable feature in the conduct of our modern ecclesiastical\r\nservices is the disappearance and painless extinction of the old parish\r\nclerk who figured so prominently in the old-fashioned ritual dear to the\r\nhearts of our forefathers. The Oxford Movement has much to answer for!\r\nPeople who have scarcely passed the rubicon of middle life can recall\r\nthe curious scene which greeted their eyes each Sunday morning when life\r\nwas young, and perhaps retain a tenderness for old abuses, and, like\r\nGeorge Eliot, have a lingering liking for nasal clerks and top-booted\r\nclerics, and sigh for the departed shades of vulgar errors.\r\n\r\nThen and now--the contrast is great. Then the hideous Georgian\r\n\"three-decker\" reared its monstrous form, blocking out the sight of the\r\nsanctuary; immense pews like cattle-pens filled the nave. The woodwork\r\nwas high and panelled, sometimes richly carved, as at Whalley Church,\r\nLancashire, where some pews have posts at the corners like an\r\nold-fashioned four-posted bed. Sometimes two feet above the top of the\r\nwoodwork there were brass rods on which slender curtains ran, and were\r\nusually drawn during sermon time in order that the attention of the\r\noccupants of the pew might not be distracted from devout meditations on\r\nthe preacher's discourse--or was it to woo slumber? A Berkshire dame\r\nrather admired these old-fashioned pews, wherein, as she naively\r\nexpressed it, \"a body might sleep comfortable without all the parish\r\nknowin' on it.\"\r\n\r\nIt was of such pews that Swift wrote in his _Baucis and Philemon_:\r\n\r\n     \"A bedstead of the antique mode,\r\n     Compact of timber many a load,\r\n     Such as our ancestors did use\r\n     Was metamorphosed into pews;\r\n     Which still their ancient nature keep\r\n     By lodging folks disposed to sleep.\"\r\n\r\nThe squire's pew was a wondrous structure, with its own special\r\nfire-place, the fire in which the old gentleman used to poke vigorously\r\nwhen the parson was too long in preaching. It was amply furnished, this\r\nsquire's pew, with arm-chairs and comfortable seats and stools and\r\nbooks. Such a pew all furnished and adorned did a worthy clerk point out\r\nto the witty Bishop of Oxford, Bishop Wilberforce, with much pride and\r\nsatisfaction. \"If there be ought your lordship can mention to mak' it\r\nbetter, I'm sure Squire will no mind gettin' on it.\"\r\n\r\nThe bishop, with a merry twinkle in his eye, turned round to the vicar,\r\nwho was standing near, and maliciously whispered:\r\n\r\n\"A card table!\"\r\n\r\nSuch comfortable squires' pews still exist in some churches, but\r\n\"restoration\" has paid scanty regard to old-fashioned notions and ideas,\r\nand the squire and his family usually sit nowadays on benches similar to\r\nthose used by the rest of the congregation.\r\n\r\nThen the choir sat in the west gallery and made strange noises and sang\r\ncurious tunes, the echoes of which we shall try to catch. No organ then\r\npealed forth its reverent tones and awaked the church with dulcet\r\nharmonies: a pitch-pipe often the sole instrument. And then--what\r\nterrible hymns were sung! Well did Campbell say of Sternhold and\r\nHopkins, the co-translators of the Psalms of David into English metre,\r\n\"mistaking vulgarity for simplicity, they turned into bathos what they\r\nfound sublime.\" And Tate and Brady's version, the \"Dry Psalter\" of\r\n\"Samuel Oxon's\" witticism, was little better. Think of the poetical\r\nbeauties of the following lines, sung with vigour by a bald-headed\r\nclerk:\r\n\r\n     \"My hairs are numerous, but few\r\n     Compared to th' enemies that me pursue.\"\r\n\r\nIt was of such a clerk and of such psalmody that John Wilmot, Earl of\r\nRochester, in the seventeenth century wrote his celebrated epigram:\r\n\r\n     \"Sternhold and Hopkins had great qualms\r\n      When they translated David's Psalms,\r\n         To make the heart more glad;\r\n      But had it been poor David's fate\r\n      To hear thee sing and them translate,\r\n         By Jove, 'twould have drove him mad.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the time for singing the metrical Psalm arrived, the clerk gave out\r\nthe number in stentorian tones, using the usual formula, \"Let us sing to\r\nthe praise and glory of God the one hundred and fourth Psalm, first,\r\nsecond, seving (seven), and eleving verses with the Doxology.\" Then,\r\npulling out his pitch-pipe from the dusty cushions of his seat, he would\r\nstrut pompously down the church, ascend the stairs leading to the west\r\ngallery, blow his pipe, and give the basses, tenors, and soprano voices\r\ntheir notes, which they hung on to in a low tone until the clerk\r\nreturned to his place in the lowest tier of the \"three-decker\" and\r\nstarted the choir-folk vigorously. Those Doxologies at the end! What a\r\ntrouble they were! You could find them if you knew where to look for\r\nthem at the end of the Prayer Book after Tate and Brady's metrical\r\nrenderings of the Psalms of David. There they were, but the right one\r\nwas hard to find. Some had two syllables too much to suit the tune, and\r\nsome had two syllables too little. But it did not matter very greatly,\r\nand we were accustomed to add a word here, or leave out one there; it\r\nwas all in a day's work, and we went home with the comfortable\r\nreflection that we had done our best.\r\n\r\nBut a pitch-pipe was not usually the sole instrument. Many village\r\nchurches had their band, composed of fiddles, flutes, clarionets, and\r\nsometimes bassoons and a drum. \"Let's go and hear the baboons,\" said a\r\nclerk mentioned by the Rev. John Eagles in his Essays. In order to\r\npreserve strict historical accuracy, I may add that this invitation was\r\nrecorded in the year 1837, and therefore could have no reference to\r\nevolutionary theories and the Descent of Man. This clerk, who invariably\r\nread \"Cheberims and Sepherims,\" and was always \"a lion to my mother's\r\nchildren,\" looking not unlike one with his shaggy hair and beard, was\r\nnot inviting a neighbour to a Sunday afternoon at the Zoo, but only to\r\nhear the bassoons.\r\n\r\nWhen the clerk gave out the hymn or Psalm, or on rare occasions the\r\nanthem, there was a strange sound of tuning up the instruments, and then\r\nthe instruments wailed forth discordant melody. The clerk conducted the\r\nchoir, composed of village lads and maidens, with a few stalwart basses\r\nand tenors. It was often a curious performance. Everybody sang as loud\r\nas he could bawl; cheeks and elbows were at their utmost efforts, the\r\nbassoon vying with the clarionet, the goose-stop of the clarionet with\r\nthe bassoon--it was Babel with the addition of the beasts. And they were\r\nall so proud of their performance. It was the only part of the service\r\nduring which no one could sleep, said one of them with pride--and he was\r\nright. No one could sleep through the terrible din. They were the most\r\nimportant officials in the church, for did not the Psalms make it clear,\r\n\"The singers go before, and the minstrels\" (which they understood to\r\nmean ministers) \"follow after\"? And then--those anthems! They were\r\nterrible inflictions. Every bumpkin had his favourite solo, and oh! the\r\nmurder, the profanation! \"Some put their trust in charrots and some in\r\n'orses,\" but they didn't \"quite pat off the stephany,\" as one of the\r\nsingers remarked, meaning symphony. It was all very strange and curious.\r\n\r\nThen followed the era of barrel-organs, the clerk's duty being to turn\r\nthe handle and start the singing. He was the only person who understood\r\nits mechanism and how to change the barrels. Sometimes accidents\r\nhappened, as at Aston Church, Yorkshire, some time in the thirties. One\r\nSunday morning during the singing of a hymn the music came to a sudden\r\nstop. There was a solemn pause, and then the clerk was seen to make his\r\nway to the front of the singing gallery, and was heard addressing the\r\nvicar in a loud tone, saying, \"Please, sor, an-ell 'as coom off.\" The\r\nhandle had come off the instrument. At another church, in\r\nHuntingdonshire, the organ was hidden from view by drawn curtains,\r\nbehind which the clerk used to retire when he had given out the Psalm.\r\nOn one occasion, however, no sound of music issued from behind the\r\ncurtains; at last, after a solemn pause, the clerk's quizzical face\r\nappeared, and his harsh voice shouted out, \"Dang it, she 'on't speak!\"\r\nThe \"grinstun organ,\" as David Diggs, the hero of Hewett's _Parish\r\nClerk_ calls it, was not always to be depended on. Every one knows the\r\nLancashire dialect story of the \"Barrel Organ\" which refused to stop,\r\nand had to be carried out of church and sat upon, and yet still\r\ncontinued to pour forth its dirge-like melody.\r\n\r\nDavid Diggs may not have been a strictly historical character, but the\r\nsketch of him was doubtless founded upon fact, and the account of the\r\nintroduction of the barrel-organ into the church of \"Seatown\" on the\r\ncoast of Sussex is evidently drawn from life. A vestry meeting was held\r\nto consider about having a _quire_ in church, and buying a barrel-organ\r\nwith half a dozen simple Psalm tunes upon it, which Davy was to turn\r\nwhile the parson put his gown on, and the children taught to sing to.\r\nThe clerk was ordered to write to the squire and ask him for a liberal\r\nsubscription. This was his letter:\r\n\r\n     \"Mr Squir, sur,\r\n\r\n     \"Me & Farmer Field & the rest of the genelmen In vestri\r\n     sembled Thinks the parson want parish Relif in shape of A\r\n     Grindstun orgin betwin Survisses--i am to grind him & the\r\n     sundy skool kildren is to sing to him wile he Gos out of\r\n     is sete.\r\n\r\n     \"We liv It to yuresef wart to giv as we dont wont to limit\r\n     yur malevolens\r\n\r\n     \"Your obedunt servunt\r\n\r\n     \"DAVY DIGGS.\"\r\n\r\nOf course this worthy scribe taught the children in the school, though\r\nwriting was happily considered a superfluous accomplishment. He taught\r\nlittle beyond the Church Catechism and the Psalms, which he knew from\r\nfrequent repetition, though he often wanted to imbue the infant minds\r\nentrusted to his charge with the Christening, Marriage, and Burial\r\nServices, and the Churching of Women, because he \"know'd um by\r\nheart himself.\"\r\n\r\nThe barrel-organ was scarcely a great improvement upon the \"cornet,\r\nflute, sackbut, psaltery\"--I mean the violins, 'cellos, clarionets, and\r\nbassoons which it supplanted. The music of the village musicians in the\r\nwest gallery was certainly not of the highest order. The instruments\r\nwere often out of tune, and the fiddle-player and the flutist were often\r\nat logger-heads; but it was a sad pity when their labours were brought\r\nto an end, and the mechanical organ took their place. The very fact that\r\nall these players took a keen interest in the conduct of Divine service\r\nwas in itself an advantage.\r\n\r\nThe barrel-organ killed the old musical life of the village. England was\r\nonce the most musical nation in Europe. Puritanism tried to kill music.\r\nOrgans were broken everywhere in the cathedrals and colleges, choirs\r\ndispersed and musical publications ceased. The professional players on\r\nviolins, lutes, and flutes who had performed in the theatres or at Court\r\nwandered away into the villages, taught the rustics how to play on their\r\nbeloved instruments in the taverns and ale-houses, and bequeathed their\r\nfiddles and clarionets to their rustic friends. Thus the rural orchestra\r\nhad its birth, and right heartily did they perform not only in church,\r\nbut at village feasts and harvest homes, wakes and weddings. The parish\r\nclerk was usually their leader, and was a welcome visitor in farm or\r\ncottage or at the manor when he conducted his companions to sing the\r\nChristmas carols.\r\n\r\nThe barrel-organ sealed the fate of the village orchestra. The old\r\nfiddles were wanted no more, and were hung up in the cottages as relics\r\nof the \"good old times.\" For a time the clerk preserved his dignity and\r\ncontinued to take his part in the music, turning the handle of\r\nthe organ.\r\n\r\nThen the harmonium came, played by the school-mistress or some other\r\nvillage performer. No wonder the clerk was indignant. His musical\r\nautocracy had been overthrown. At one church--Swanscombe, Kent--when, in\r\n1854, the change had taken place, and a kind lady, Miss F----, had\r\nconsented to play the new harmonium, the clerk, village cobbler and\r\nleader of parish orchestra, gave out the hymn in his accustomed fashion,\r\nand then, with consummate scorn, bellowed out, \"Now, then, Miss F----,\r\nstrike up!\"\r\n\r\nIt would have been a far wiser policy to have reformed the old village\r\norchestra, to have taught the rustic musicians to play better, than to\r\nhave silenced them for ever and substituted the \"grinstun\" instrument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VILLAGE CHOIR]\r\n\r\nArchbishop Tait once said that there is no one who does not look back\r\nwith a kind of shame to the sort of sermons which were preached, the\r\nsort of clergymen who preached them, the sort of building in which they\r\npreached them, and the sort of psalmody with which the service was\r\nushered in. The late Mr. Beresford Hope thus describes the kind of\r\nservice that went on in the time of George IV in a market town of Surrey\r\nnot far from London. It was a handsome Gothic church, the chancel being\r\ncut off from the nave by a solid partition covered with verses and\r\nstrange paintings, among which Moses and Aaron show in peculiar\r\nuncouthness. The aisles were filled with family pews or private boxes,\r\nraised aloft, and approached by private doors and staircases. These were\r\nowned by the magnates of the place, who were wont to bow their\r\nrecognitions across the nave. There was a decrepit west gallery for the\r\nband, and the ground floor was crammed with cranky pews of every shape.\r\nA Carolean pulpit stood against a pillar, with reading-desk and clerk's\r\nbox underneath. The ante-Communion Service was read from the desk,\r\nseparated from the liturgy and sermon by such renderings of Tate and\r\nBrady as the unruly gang of volunteers with fiddles and wind instruments\r\nin the gallery pleased to contribute. The clerk, a wizened old fellow in\r\na brown wig, repeated the responses in a nasal twang, and with a\r\nsubstitution of _w_ for _v_ so constant as not even to spare the\r\nBeliefs; while the local rendering of briefs, citations, and\r\nexcommunications included announcements by this worthy, after the Nicene\r\nCreed, of meetings at the town inn of the executors of a deceased duke.\r\nTwo hopeful cubs of the clerk sprawled behind him in the desk, and the\r\nback-handers occasionally intended to reduce them to order were apt to\r\nresound against the impassive boards. During the sermon this zealous\r\nservant of the sanctuary would take up his broom and sweep out the\r\nmiddle alley, in order to save himself the fatigue of a weekday visit.\r\nSoon, however, the clerk and his broom followed Moses and Aaron, the\r\nfiddles and the bassoons into the land of shadows.\r\n\r\nNo sketch of bygone times, in which the clerk flourished in all his\r\nglory, would be complete without some reference to the important person\r\nwho occupied the second tier in the \"three-decker,\" and decked in gown\r\nand bands delivered somnolent sermons from its upper storey. Curious\r\nstories are often told of the careless parsons of former days, of their\r\nirreverence, their love of sport, their neglect of their parishes, their\r\nquaint and irreverent manners; but such characters, about whom these\r\nstories were told, were exceptional. By far the greater number lived\r\nwell and did their duty and passed away, and left no memories behind\r\nexcept in the tender recollections of a few simple-minded folk. There\r\nwere few local newspapers in those days to tell their virtues, to print\r\ntheir sermons or their speeches at the opening of bazaars or\r\nflower-shows. They did their duty and passed away and were forgotten;\r\nwhile the parsons, like the wretch Chowne of the _Maid of Sker_, live on\r\nin anecdote, and grave folk shake their heads and think that the times\r\nmust have been very bad, and the clergy a disgrace to their cloth. As\r\nwith the clerk, so with his master; the evil that men do lives after\r\nthem, the good is forgotten. There has been a vast amount of\r\nexaggeration in the accounts that have come down to us of the\r\nfaithlessness, sluggishness, idleness, and base conduct of the clergy of\r\nthe eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and perhaps a little too\r\nmuch boasting about the progress which our age has witnessed.\r\n\r\nIt would be an easy task to record the lives of many worthy country\r\nclergymen of the much-abused Hanoverian period, who were exemplary\r\nparish priests, pious, laborious, and beloved. In recording the\r\neccentricities and lack of reverence of many clerics and their faithful\r\nservitors, it is well to remember the many bright lights that shone like\r\nlamps in a dark place.\r\n\r\nIt would be a difficult task to write a history of our parish\r\npriesthood, for reasons which have already been stated, and such a\r\nlabour is beyond our present purpose. But it may be well to record a few\r\nof the observations which contemporary writers have made upon the\r\nparsons of their day in order to show that they were by no means a set\r\nof careless, disreputable, and unworthy men.\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of the eighteenth century there lived at\r\nSeathwaite, Lancashire, as curate, the famous Robert Walker, styled \"the\r\nWonderful,\" \"a man singular for his temperance, industry, and\r\nintegrity,\" as the parish register records.\r\n\r\nWordsworth alludes to him in his eighteenth sonnet on Durdon as a worthy\r\ncompeer of the country parson of Chaucer, and in the seventh book of the\r\n_Excursion_ an abstract of his character is given:\r\n\r\n     \"A priest abides before whose lips such doubts\r\n     Fall to the ground, as in those days\r\n     When this low pile a gospel preacher knew\r\n     Whose good works formed an endless retinue;\r\n     A pastor such as Chaucer's verse portrays,\r\n     Such as the heaven-taught skill of Herbert drew,\r\n     And tender Goldsmith crown'd with deathless praise.\"\r\n\r\nThe poet also gives a short memoir of the Wonderful Walker. In this\r\noccurs the following extract from a letter dated 1775:\r\n\r\n\"By his frugality and good management he keeps the wolf from the door,\r\nas we say; and if he advances a little in the world it is owing more to\r\nhis own care than to anything else he has to rely upon. I don't find his\r\ninclination in running after further preferment. He is settled among the\r\npeople that are happy among themselves, and lives in the greatest\r\nunanimity and friendship with them; and, I believe, the minister and\r\npeople are exceedingly satisfied with each other: and indeed, how should\r\nthey be dissatisfied, when they have a person of so much worth and\r\nprobity for their pastor? A man who for his candour and meekness, his\r\nsober, chaste, and virtuous conversation, his soundness in principle and\r\npractice, is an ornament to his profession and an honour to the country\r\nhe is in; and bear with me if I say, the plainness of his dress, the\r\nsanctity of his manners, the simplicity of his doctrine, and the\r\nvehemence of his expression, have a sort of resemblance to the pure\r\npractice of primitive Christianity.\"\r\n\r\nThe income of his chapelry was the munificent sum of £17 10 s. He reared\r\nand educated a numerous family of twelve children. Every Sunday he\r\nentertained those members of his congregation who came from a distance,\r\ntaught the village school, acted as scrivener and lawyer for the\r\ndistrict, farmed, and helped his neighbours in haymaking and\r\nsheep-shearing, spun cloth, studied natural history, and, in spite of\r\nall this, was throughout a devoted and earnest parish priest. He was\r\ncertainly entitled to his epithet \"the Wonderful.\"\r\n\r\nGoldsmith has given us a charming picture of an old-world parson in his\r\n_Vicar of Wakefield_, and Fielding sketches a no less worthy cleric in\r\nhis portrait of the Rev. Abraham Adams in _his Joseph Andrews_. As a\r\ncompanion picture he drew the character of the pig-keeping Parson\r\nTrulliber, no scandalous cleric, though he cared more for his cows and\r\npigs than he did for his parishioners.\r\n\r\n\"Hawks should not peck out hawks' e'en,\" and parsons should not scoff at\r\ntheir fellows; yet Crabbe was a little unkind in his description of\r\ncountry parsons, though he could say little against the character of\r\nhis vicar.\r\n\r\n     \"Our Priest was cheerful and in season gay;\r\n     His frequent visits seldom fail'd to please;\r\n     Easy himself, he sought his neighbour's ease.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Simple he was, and loved the simple truth,\r\n     Yet had some useful cunning from his youth;\r\n     A cunning never to dishonour lent,\r\n     And rather for defence than conquest meant;\r\n     'Twas fear of power, with some desire to rise,\r\n     But not enough to make him enemies;\r\n     He ever aim'd to please; and to offend\r\n     Was ever cautious; for he sought a friend.\r\n     Fiddling and fishing were his arts, at times\r\n     He alter'd sermons, and he aimed at rhymes;\r\n     And his fair friends, not yet intent on cards,\r\n     Oft he amused with riddles and charades,\r\n     Mild were his doctrines, and not one discourse\r\n     But gained in softness what it lost in force;\r\n     Kind his opinions; he would not receive\r\n     An ill report, nor evil act believe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Now rests our vicar. They who knew him best\r\n     Proclaim his life t' have been entirely--rest.\r\n     The rich approved--of them in awe he stood;\r\n     The poor admired--they all believed him good;\r\n     The old and serious of his habits spoke;\r\n     The frank and youthful loved his pleasant joke;\r\n     Mothers approved a safe contented guest,\r\n     And daughters one who backed each small request;\r\n     In him his flock found nothing to condemn;\r\n     Him sectaries liked--he never troubled them;\r\n     No trifles failed his yielding mind to please,\r\n     And all his passions sunk in early ease;\r\n     Nor one so old has left this world of sin\r\n     More like the being that he entered in.\"\r\n\r\nA somewhat caustic and sarcastic sketch, and perhaps a little\r\nill-natured, of a somewhat amiable cleric. Dr. Syntax is a good example\r\nof an old-world parson, whose biographer thus describes his\r\nlaborious life:\r\n\r\n     \"Of Church preferment he had none;\r\n     Nay, all his hope of that was gone;\r\n     He felt that he content must be\r\n     With drudging-in a curacy.\r\n     Indeed, on ev'ry Sabbath-day,\r\n     Through eight long miles he took his way,\r\n     To preach, to grumble, and to pray;\r\n     To cheer the good, to warn the sinner,\r\n     And if he got it,--eat a dinner:\r\n     To bury these, to christen those,\r\n     And marry such fond folks as chose\r\n     To change the tenor of their life,\r\n     And risk the matrimonial strife.\r\n     Thus were his weekly journeys made,\r\n     'Neath summer suns and wintry shade;\r\n     And all his gains, it did appear,\r\n     Were only thirty pounds a-year.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when the last event of his hard-working life was over--\r\n\r\n     \"The village wept, the hamlets round\r\n     Crowded the consecrated ground;\r\n     And waited there to see the end\r\n     Of Pastor, Teacher, Father, Friend.\"\r\n\r\nWho could write a better epitaph?\r\n\r\nDoubtless the crying evil of what is called \"the dead period\" of the\r\nChurch's history was pluralism. It was no uncommon thing for a clergyman\r\nto hold half a dozen benefices, in one of which he would reside, and\r\nappoint curates with slender stipends to the rest, only showing himself\r\n\"when tithing time draws near.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Bishop Stanley became Bishop of Norwich in 1837 there were six\r\nhundred non-resident incumbents, a state of things which he did a vast\r\namount of work to remedy. Mr. Clitherow tells me of a friend who was\r\ngoing to be married and who requested a neighbour to take his two\r\nservices for him during his brief honeymoon. The neighbour at first\r\nhesitated, but at last consented, having six other services to take on\r\nthe one Sunday.\r\n\r\nAn old clergyman named Field lived at Cambridge and served three country\r\nparishes--Hauxton, Newton, and Barnington. On Sunday morning he used to\r\nride to Hauxton, which he could see from the high road to Newton. If\r\nthere was a congregation, the clerk used to waggle his hat on the top of\r\na long pole kept in the church porch, and Field had to turn down the\r\nroad and take the service. If there was no congregation he went on\r\nstraight to Newton, where there was always a congregation, as two old\r\nladies were always present. Field used to turn his pony loose in the\r\nchurchyard, and as he entered the church began the Exhortation, so that\r\nby the time he was robed he had progressed well through the service. My\r\ninformant, the Rev. M.J. Bacon, was curate at Newton, and remembers well\r\nthe old surplice turned up and shortened at the bottom, where the old\r\nparson's spurs had frayed it.\r\n\r\nIt was this pluralism that led to much abuse, much neglect, and much\r\ncarelessness. However, enough has been said about the shepherd, and we\r\nmust return to his helper, the clerk, with whose biography and history\r\nwe are mainly concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE ANTIQUITY AND CONTINUITY OF THE OFFICE OF CLERK\r\n\r\nThe office of parish clerk can claim considerable antiquity, and dates\r\nback to the times of Augustine and King Ethelbert. Pope Gregory the\r\nGreat, in writing to St. Augustine of Canterbury with regard to the\r\norder and constitution of the Church in new lands and under new\r\ncircumstances, laid down sundry regulations with regard to the clerk's\r\nmarriage and mode of life. King Ethelbert, by the advice of his\r\nWitenagemote, introduced certain judicial decrees, which set down what\r\nsatisfaction should be given by those who stole anything belonging to\r\nthe church. The purloiner of a clerk's property was ordered to restore\r\nthreefold[2]. The canons of King Edgar, which may be attributed to the\r\nwise counsel of St. Dunstan, ordered every clergyman to attend the synod\r\nyearly and to bring his clerk with him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Bede's _Hist. Eccles_., ii. v.]\r\n\r\nThus from early Saxon times the history of the office can be traced.\r\n\r\nHis name is merely the English form of the Latin _clericus_, a word\r\nwhich signified any one who took part in the services of the Church,\r\nwhether he was in major or minor orders. A clergyman is still a \"clerk\r\nin Holy Orders,\" and a parish clerk signified one who belonged to the\r\nrank of minor orders and assisted the parish priest in the services of\r\nthe parish church. We find traces of him abroad in early days. In the\r\nseventh century, the canons of the Ninth Council of Toledo and of the\r\nCouncil of Merida tell of his services in the worship of the sanctuary,\r\nand in the ninth century he has risen to prominence in the Gallican\r\nChurch, as we gather from the inquiries instituted by Archbishop\r\nHincmar, of Rheims, who demanded of the rural deans whether each\r\npresbyter had a clerk who could keep school, or read the epistle, or was\r\nable to sing.\r\n\r\nIn the decretals of Gregory IX there is a reference to the clerk's\r\noffice, and his duties obtain the sanction of canon law. Every incumbent\r\nis ordered to have a clerk who shall sing with him the service, read the\r\nepistle and lesson, teach in the school, and admonish the parishioners\r\nto send their children to the church to be instructed in the faith. It\r\nwas thus in ancient days that the Church provided for the education of\r\nchildren, a duty which she has always endeavoured to perform. Her\r\nofficers were the schoolmasters. The weird cry of the abolition of tests\r\nfor teachers was then happily unknown.\r\n\r\nThe strenuous Bishop Grosseteste (1235-53), for the better ordering of\r\nhis diocese of Lincoln, laid down the injunction that \"in every church\r\nof sufficient means there shall be a deacon or sub-deacon; but in the\r\nrest a fitting and honest clerk to serve the priest in a comely habit.\"\r\nThe clerk's office was also discussed in the same century at a synod at\r\nExeter in 1289, when it was decided that where there was a school within\r\nten miles of any parish some scholar should be chosen for the office of\r\nparish clerk. This rule provided for poor scholars who intended to\r\nproceed to the priesthood, and also secured suitable teachers for the\r\nchildren of the parishes.\r\n\r\nIt appears that an attempt was made to enforce celibacy on the holders\r\nof minor orders, an experiment which was not crowned with success.\r\nWilliam Lyndewoode, Official Principal of the Archbishop of Canterbury\r\nin 1429, speaks thus of the married clerk:--\r\n\r\n\"He is a clerk, not therefore a layman; but if twice married he must be\r\ncounted among laymen, because such an one is deprived of all clerical\r\nprivilege. If, however, he were married, albeit not twice, yet so long\r\nas he wears the clerical habit and tonsure he shall be held a clerk in\r\ntwo respects, to wit, that he may enjoy the clerical privilege in his\r\nperson, and that he may not be brought before the secular judges. But in\r\nall other respects he shall be considered as a layman.\"\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the parish clerks became\r\nimportant officials. We shall see presently how they were incorporated\r\ninto fraternities or guilds, and how they played a prominent part in\r\ncivic functions, in state funerals, and in ecclesiastical matters. The\r\nReformation rather added to than diminished the importance of the office\r\nand the dignity of the holder of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MEDIÆVAL CLERK]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CLERK IN PROCESSION]\r\n\r\nThe continuity of the office is worthy of record. From the days of\r\nAugustine to the present time it has never ceased to exist. The clerk is\r\nthe last representative of the minor orders which the ecclesiastical\r\nchanges wrought in the sixteenth century have left us. Prior to the\r\nReformation there were sub-deacons who wore alb and maniple, acolytes,\r\nthe tokens of whose office were a taper staff and small pitcher,\r\nostiaries or doorkeepers corresponding to our verger or clerk, readers,\r\nexorcists, _rectores chori_, etc. This full staff would, of course,\r\nbe not available for every country church, and for such parishes a clerk\r\nand a boy acolyte doubtless sufficed, though in large churches there\r\nwere representatives of all these various officials. They disappeared in\r\nthe Reformation; only the clerk remained, incorporating in his own\r\nperson the offices of reader, acolyte, sub-deacon.\r\n\r\nIndeed, if in these enlightened days any proof were needed of the\r\nhistorical continuity of the English Church, it would be found in the\r\npermanence of the clerk's office. Just as in many instances the same\r\nindividual rector or vicar continued to hold his living during the whole\r\nperiod of the Reformation era, witnessing the spoliation of his church\r\nby the greedy Commissioners of Henry VIII and Edward VI, the\r\nintroduction of the First Prayer Book of Edward VI, the revival of the\r\n\"old religion\" under Queen Mary, the triumph of Reformation principles\r\nunder Queen Elizabeth; so did the parish clerk continue to hold office\r\nalso. The Reformation changed many of his functions and duties, but the\r\noffice remained. The old churchwardens' account books bear witness to\r\nthis fact. Previous to the Reformation he received certain wages and\r\nmany \"perquisites\" from the inhabitants of the parish for distributing\r\nthe holy loaf and the holy water. At St. Giles's, Reading, in the year\r\n1518-19, appears the item:\r\n\r\nEXPENS. In p'mis paid for the dekays of the Clark's wages vis.\r\n\r\nIn the following year we notice:\r\n\r\n     WAGE. Paid to Harry Water Clerk for his wage for a yere ended\r\n     at thannacon of our lady a° xi° ... xxvi s. viii d.\r\n\r\nIn 1545-6, Whitborne, the clerk, received 12 s. towards his wages, and\r\nhe \"to be bound to teche ij children free for the quere.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the Reformation, in the same town we find the same clerk\r\ncontinuing in office. He no longer went round the parish bearing holy\r\nwater, but the collecting of money for the holy loaf continued, the\r\nproceeds being devoted to the necessary expenses of the church. Thus in\r\nthe Injunctions given by the King's Majesty's visitors to the clergy and\r\nlaity resident in the Deanery of Doncaster in the second year of the\r\nreign of King Edward VI, appears the following:\r\n\r\n\"_Item_. The churchwardens of every Parish-Church shall, some one\r\n_Sunday_, or other Festival day, every month, go about the Church, and\r\nmake request to every of the Parish for their charitable Contribution to\r\nthe Poor; and the sum so collected shall be put in the Chest of Alms for\r\nthat purpose provided. And for as much as the Parish-Clerk shall not\r\nhereafter go about the Parish with his Holy Water as hath been\r\naccustomed, he shall, instead of that labour, accompany the said\r\nChurch-Wardens, and in a Book Register the name and Sum of every man\r\nthat giveth any thing to the Poor, and the same shall intable; and\r\nagainst the next day of Collection, shall hang up somewhere in the\r\nChurch in open place, to the intent the Poor having knowledge thereby,\r\nby whose Charity and Alms they be relieved, may pray for the increase\r\nand prosperity of the same[3].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _The Clerk's Book of 1549_, edited by J. Wickham Legg,\r\nAppendix IX, p. 95.]\r\n\r\nThis is only one instance out of many which might be quoted to prove\r\nthat the clerk's office by no means ceased to exist after the\r\nReformation changes. I shall refer later on to the survival of the\r\ncollection of money for the holy loaf and to its transference to\r\nother uses.\r\n\r\nThe clerk, therefore, appears to have continued to hold his office\r\nshorn of some of his former duties. He witnessed all the changes of that\r\nchangeful time, the spoliation of his church, the selling of numerous\r\naltar cloths, vestments, banners, plate, and other costly furniture,\r\nand, moreover, took his part in the destruction of altars and the\r\ndesecration of the sanctuary. In the accounts for the year 1559 of the\r\nChurch of St. Lawrence, Reading, appear the items:\r\n\r\n\"Itm--for taking-downe the awlters and laying the stones, vs.\r\n\r\n\"To Loryman (the clerk) for carrying out the rubbish x d[4].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Rev. C. Kerry's _History of S. Lawrence's Church, Reading_,\r\np. 25.]\r\n\r\nIndeed, the clerk can claim a more perfect continuity of office than the\r\nrector or vicar. There was a time when the incumbents were forced to\r\nleave their cure and give place to an intruding minister appointed by\r\nthe Cromwellian Parliament. But the clerk remained on to chant his\r\n\"Amen\" to the long-winded prayers of some black-gowned Puritan. That is\r\na very realistic scene sketched by Sir Walter Besant when he describes\r\nthe old clerk, an ancient man and rheumatic, hobbling slowly through the\r\nvillage, key in hand, to the church door. It was towards the end of the\r\nPuritan regime. After ringing the bell and preparing the church for the\r\nservice, he goes into the vestry, where stood an ancient black oak\r\ncoffer, the sides curiously graven, and a great rusty key in the lock.\r\nThe clerk (Sir Walter calls him the sexton, but it is evidently the\r\nclerk who is referred to) turns the key with difficulty, throws open the\r\nlid, and looks in.\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" he says, chuckling, \"the old surplice and the old Book of Common\r\nPrayer. Ye have had a long rest; 'tis time for you both to come out\r\nagain. When the surplice is out, the book will stay no longer locked\r\nup.\" He draws forth an old and yellow roll. It was the surplice which\r\nhad once been white. \"Here you be,\" he says; \"put you away for a matter\r\nof twelve year and more, and you bide your time; you know you will come\r\nback again; you are not in any hurry. Even the clerk dies; but you die\r\nnot, you bide your time. Everything comes again. The old woman shall\r\ngive you a taste o' the suds and the hot iron. Thus we go up and thus we\r\ngo down.\" Then he takes up the old book, musty and damp after twelve\r\nyears' imprisonment. \"Fie,\" he says, \"thy leather is parting from thy\r\nboards, and thy leaves they do stick together. Shalt have a pot of\r\npaste, and then lie in the sun before thou goest back to the desk.\r\nWhether 'tis Mass or Common Prayer, whether 'tis Independent or\r\nPresbyterian, folk mun still die and be buried--ay, and married and\r\nborn--whatever they do say. Parson goes and Preacher comes; Preacher\r\ngoes and Parson comes; but Sexton stays.\" He chuckles again, puts back\r\nthe surplice and the book, and locks the coffer[5].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _For Faith and Freedom_, by Sir Walter Besant, chap. 1.]\r\n\r\nLike many of his brethren, he had seen the Church of England displaced\r\nby the Presbyterians, and the Presbyterians by the Independents, and the\r\nrestoration of the Church. His father, who had been clerk before him,\r\nhad seen the worship of the \"old religion\" in Queen Mary's time, and all\r\nthe time the village life had been going on, and the clerk's work had\r\ncontinued; his office remained. In village churches the duties of clerk\r\nand sexton are usually performed by the same person. Not long ago a\r\ngentleman was visiting a village church, and was much struck by the\r\nremarks of an old man who seemed to know each stone and tomb and legend.\r\nThe stranger asking him what his occupation was, he replied:\r\n\r\n\"I hardly know what I be. First vicar he called me clerk; then another\r\ncame, and he called me virgin; the last vicar said I were the Christian,\r\nand now I be clerk again.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"virgin\" was naturally a slight confusion for verger, and the\r\n\"christian\" was a corrupt form of sacristan or sexton. All the duties of\r\nthese various callings were combined in the one individual.\r\n\r\nThat story reminds one of another concerning the diligent clerk of\r\nR----, who, in addition to the ordinary duties of his office, kept the\r\nregisters and acted as groom, gardener, and footman at the rectory. A\r\nrather pompous rector's wife used to like to refer at intervals during a\r\ndinner-party to \"our coachman says,\" \"our gardener always does this,\"\r\n\"our footman is ...,\" leaving the impression of a somewhat large\r\nestablishment. The dear old rector used to disturb the vision of a large\r\nretinue by saying, \"They are all one--old Corby, the clerk.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the chief characteristics of old parish clerks, whether in\r\nancient or modern times, is their faithfulness to their church and to\r\ntheir clergyman. We notice this again and again in the biographies of\r\nmany of these worthy men which it has been a privilege to study. The\r\nmotto of the city of Exeter, _Semper fidelis_, might with truth have\r\nbeen recorded as the legend of their class. This fidelity must have been\r\nsorely tried in the sad days of the Commonwealth period, when the\r\nsufferings of the clergy began, and the poor clerk had to bid farewell\r\nto his beloved pastor and welcome and \"sit under\" some hard-visaged\r\nPresbyterian or Puritan preacher.\r\n\r\nIsaac Walton tells the pathetic story of the faithful clerk of the\r\nparish of Borne, near Canterbury, where the \"Judicious\" Hooker was\r\nincumbent. The vicar and clerk were on terms of great affection, and\r\nHooker was of \"so mild and humble a nature that his poor clerk and he\r\ndid never talk but with both their hats on, or both off, at the\r\nsame time.\"\r\n\r\nThis same clerk lived on in the quiet village until the third or fourth\r\nyear of the Long Parliament. Hooker died and was buried at Borne, and\r\nmany people used to visit his monument, and the clerk had many rewards\r\nfor showing his grave-place, and often heard his praises sung by the\r\nvisitors, and used to add his own recollections of his holiness and\r\nhumility. But evil days came; the parson of Borne was sequestered, and a\r\nGenevan minister put into his good living. The old clerk, seeing so many\r\nclergymen driven from their homes and churches, used to say, \"They have\r\nsequestered so many good men, that I doubt if my good Master Hooker had\r\nlived till now, they would have sequestered him too.\"\r\n\r\nWalton then describes the conversion of the church into a Genevan\r\nconventicle. He wrote: \"It was not long before this intruding minister\r\nhad made a party in and about the said parish that was desirous to\r\nreceive the sacrament as at Geneva: to which end, the day was appointed\r\nfor a select company, and forms and stools set about the altar or\r\ncommunion table for them to sit and eat and drink; but when they went\r\nabout this work, there was a want of some joint-stools which the\r\nminister sent the clerk to fetch, and then to fetch cushions. When the\r\nclerk saw them begin to sit down, he began to wonder; but the minister\r\nbade him cease wondering and lock the church door: to whom he replied,\r\n'Pray take you the keys, and lock me out: I will never more come into\r\nthis church; for men will say my Master Hooker was a good man and a\r\ngreat scholar; and I am sure it was not used to be thus in his days':\r\nand report says this old man went presently home and died; I do not say\r\ndied immediately, but within a few days after. But let us leave this\r\ngrateful clerk in his quiet grave.\"\r\n\r\nAnother faithful clerk was William Hobbes, who served in the church and\r\nparish of St. Andrew, Plymouth. Walker, in his _Sufferings of the\r\nClergy_, records the sad story of his death. During the troubles of the\r\nCivil War period, when presumably there was no clergyman to perform the\r\nlast rites of the Church on the body of a parishioner, the good clerk\r\nhimself undertook the office, and buried a corpse, using the service for\r\nthe Burial of the Dead contained in the Book of Common Prayer. The\r\nPuritans were enraged, and threatened to throw him into the same grave\r\nif he came there again with his \"Mass-book\" to bury any body: which\r\n\"worked so much upon his Spirits, that partly with Fear and partly with\r\nGrief, he Died soon after.\" He died in 1643, and the accounts of the\r\nchurch show that the balance of his salary was paid to his widow.\r\n\r\nMany such faithful clerks have devoted their years of active life to the\r\nservice of God in His sanctuary, both in ancient and modern times; and\r\nit will be our pleasurable duty to record some of the biographies of\r\nthese earnest servants of the Church, whose services are too often\r\ndisregarded.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the continuity of the clerk's office, unbroken by\r\neither Reformation changes or by the confusion of the Puritan regime. We\r\nwill now endeavour to sketch the appearance of the mediæval clerk, and\r\nthe numerous duties which fell to his lot.\r\n\r\nChaucer's gallery of ancient portraits contains a very life-like\r\npresentment of a mediæval clerk in the person of \"Jolly Absolon,\" a\r\nsomewhat frivolous specimen of his class, who figures largely in _The\r\nMiller's Tale_.\r\n\r\n     \"Now was ther of that churche a parish clerk\r\n     The which that was y-cleped[6] Absolon.\r\n     Curl'd was his hair, and as the gold it shone,\r\n     And strutted[7] as a fannë large and broad;\r\n     Full straight and even lay his folly shode.[8]\r\n     His rode[9] was red, his eyen grey as goose,\r\n     With Paulë's windows carven on his shoes.[10]\r\n     In hosen red he went full febishly.[11]\r\n     Y-clad he was full small and properly,\r\n     All in a kirtle of a light waget;[12]\r\n     Full fair and thickë be the pointës set.\r\n     And thereupon he had a gay surplice,\r\n     As white as is the blossom on the rise.[13]\r\n     A merry child he was, so God me save;\r\n     Well could he letten blood, and clip, and shave,\r\n     And make a charter of land and a quittance.\r\n     In twenty manners could he trip and dance,\r\n     After the school of Oxenfordë tho',[14]\r\n     And with his leggës castë to and fro;\r\n     And playen songës or a small ribible;[15]\r\n     Thereto he sung sometimes a loud quinible.[16]\r\n     And as well could he play on a gitern.[17]\r\n     In all the town was brewhouse nor tavern\r\n     That he not visited with his solas,[18]\r\n     There as that any gaillard tapstere[19] was.\r\n       This Absolon, that jolly was and gay\r\n       Went with a censor on the holy day,\r\n       Censing the wivës of the parish fast:\r\n       And many a lovely look he on them cast,\r\n\r\n      *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n       Sometimes to show his lightness and mast'ry\r\n       He playeth Herod on a scaffold high.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Called.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Stretched.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Head of hair.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Complexion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: His shoes were decked with an ornament like a rose-window\r\nin old St. Paul's.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Daintily.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: A kind of cloth.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: A bush.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: The Oxford school of dancing is satirised by the poet.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: A kind of fiddle.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Treble.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Guitar.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Sport, mirth.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Tavern-wench.]\r\n\r\nI fear me Master Absolon was a somewhat frivolous clerk, or his memory\r\nhas been traduced by the poet's pen, which lacked not satire and a\r\ncaustic but good-humoured wit. Here was a parish clerk who could sing\r\nwell, though he did not confine his melodies to \"Psalms and hymns and\r\nspiritual songs.\" He wore a surplice; he was an accomplished scrivener,\r\nand therefore a man of some education; he could perform the offices of\r\nthe barber-surgeon, and one of his duties was to cense the people in\r\ntheir houses. He was an actor of no mean repute, and took a leading part\r\nin the mysteries or miracle-plays, concerning which we shall have more\r\nto tell. He even could undertake the prominent part of Herod, which\r\ndoubtless was an object of competition among the amateurs of the period.\r\nSuch is the picture which Chaucer draws of the frivolous clerk, a sketch\r\nwhich is accurate enough as far as it goes, and one that we will\r\nendeavour to fill in with sundry details culled from medieval sources.\r\n\r\nChaucer tells us that Jolly Absolon used to go to the houses of the\r\nparishioners on holy days with his censer. His more usual duty was to\r\nbear to them the holy water, and hence he acquired the title of\r\n_aquæbajalus_. This holy water consisted of water into which, after\r\nexorcism, blest salt had been placed, and then duly sanctified with the\r\nsign of the cross and sacerdotal benediction. We can see the clerk clad\r\nin his surplice setting out in the morning of Sunday on his rounds. He\r\nis carrying a holy-water vat, made of brass or wood, containing the\r\nblest water, and in his hand is an _aspergillum_ or sprinkler. This\r\nconsists of a round brush of horse-hair with a short handle. When the\r\nclerk arrives at the great house of the village he first enters the\r\nkitchen, and seeing the cook engaged on her household duties, he dips\r\nthe sprinkler into the holy-water vessel and shakes it towards her, as\r\nin the accompanying illustration. Then he visits the lord and lady of\r\nthe manor, who are sitting at meat in their solar, and asperges them in\r\nlike manner. For his pains he receives from every householder some gift,\r\nand goes on his way rejoicing. Bishop Alexander, of Coventry, however,\r\nin his constitutions drawn up in the year 1237, ordered that no clerk\r\nwho serves in a church may live from the fees derived from this source,\r\nand the penalty of suspension was to be inflicted on any one who should\r\ntransgress this rule. The constitutions of the parish clerks at Trinity\r\nChurch, Coventry, made in 1462, are a most valuable source of\r\ninformation with regard to the clerk's duties.\r\n\r\nThe following items refer to the orders relating to the holy water:\r\n\r\n     \"Item, the dekyn shall bring a woly water stoke with water\r\n     for hys preste every Sonday for the preste to make\r\n     woly water.\r\n\r\n     \"Item, the said dekyn shall every Sonday beyr woly water of\r\n     hys chyldern to euery howse in hys warde, and he to have hys\r\n     duty off euery man affter hys degre quarterly.\"\r\n\r\nAt the church of St. Nicholas, Bristol, in 1481, it was ordered that the\r\n\"Clerke to ordeynn spryngals[20] for the church, and for him that\r\nvisiteth the Sondays and dewly to bere his holy water to euery howse\r\nAbyding soo convenient a space that every man may receive hys Holy water\r\nunder payne of iiii d. tociens quociens.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Bunches of twigs for sprinkling holy water.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CLERK BEARING HOLY WATER AND ASPERGING THE COOK]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CLERK BEARING HOLY WATER AND ASPERGING THE LORD AND\r\nLADY]\r\n\r\nAt Faversham a set of parish clerk's duties of the years 1506, 1548, and\r\n1593 is preserved. In the rules ordained for his guidance in the\r\nfirst-mentioned year he with his assistant clerk is ordered to bear holy\r\nwater to every man's house, as of old time hath been accustomed; in case\r\nof default he shall forfeit 8 d.; but if he shall be very much occupied\r\non account of a principal feast falling on a Sunday or with any pressing\r\nparochial business, he is to be excused.\r\n\r\nA mighty dissension disturbed the equanimity of the little parish of\r\nMorebath in the year 1531 and continued for several years. The quarrel\r\narose concerning the dues to be paid to the parish clerk, a small number\r\nof persons refusing to pay the just demands. After much disputing they\r\nfinally came to an agreement, and one of the items was that the clerk\r\nshould go about the parish with his holy water once a year, when men had\r\nshorn their sheep to gather some wool to make him a coat to go in the\r\nparish in his livery. There are many other items in the agreement to\r\nwhich we shall have occasion again to refer. Let us hope that the good\r\npeople of Morebath settled down amicably after this great \"storm in a\r\ntea-cup\"; but this godly union and concord could not have lasted very\r\nlong, as mighty changes were in progress, and much upsetting of\r\nold-established custom and practice.\r\n\r\nThe clerk continued in many parishes to make his accustomed round of the\r\nhouses, and collected money which was used for the defraying of the\r\nexpenses of public worship; but he left behind him his sprinkler and\r\nholy-water vat, which accorded not with the principles and tenets, the\r\npractice and ceremonies of the reformed Church of England.\r\n\r\nThis was, however, one of the minor duties of the mediæval clerk, and\r\nthe custom of giving offerings to him seems to have started with a\r\ncharitable intent. The constitutions of Archbishop Boniface of\r\nCanterbury issued in 1260 state:\r\n\r\n\"We have often heard from our elders that the benefices of holy water\r\nwere originally instituted from a motive of charity, in order that one\r\nof their proper poor clerks might have exhibitions to the schools, and\r\nso advance in learning, that they might be fit for higher preferment.\"\r\n\r\nHe had many other and more important duties to perform, duties requiring\r\na degree of education far superior to that which we are accustomed to\r\nassociate with the holders of his office. We will endeavour to obtain a\r\ntruer sketch of him than even that drawn by Chaucer, and to realise the\r\nmultitudinous duties which fell to his lot, and the great services he\r\nrendered to God and to his Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE MEDIÆVAL CLERK\r\n\r\nAt the present time loud complaints are frequently heard of a lack of\r\nclergy. Rectors and vicars are sighing for assistant curates, the vast\r\npopulations of our great cities require additional ministration, and the\r\nmission field is crying out for more labourers to reap the harvests of\r\nthe world. It might be well in this emergency to inquire into the\r\nmethods of the mediæval Church, and observe how the clergy in those days\r\nfaced the problem, and gained for themselves tried and trusty helpers.\r\n\r\nOne method of great utility was to appoint poor scholars to the office\r\nof parish clerk, by a due discharge of the duties of which they were\r\ntrained to serve in church and in the parish, and might ultimately hope\r\nto attain to the ministry. This is borne out by the evidence of wills\r\nwherein some good incumbent, grateful for the faithful services of his\r\nclerk, bequeaths either books or money to him, in order to enable him to\r\nprepare himself for higher preferment. Thus in 1389 the rector of Marum,\r\none Robert de Weston, bequeaths to \"John Penne, my clerk, a missal of\r\nthe New Use of Sarum, if he wishes to be a priest, otherwise I give him\r\n20 s.\" In 1337 Giles de Gadlesmere leaves \"to William Ockam, clerk, two\r\nshillings, unless he be promoted before my death.\" Evidently it was no\r\nunusual practice in early times for the clerk to be raised to Holy\r\nOrders, his office being regarded as a stepping-stone to higher\r\npreferment. The status of the clerk was then of no servile character.\r\n\r\nA canon of Newburgh asked for Sir William Plumpton's influence that his\r\nbrother might have a clerkship[21]. Even the sons of kings and lords did\r\nnot consider it beneath the dignity of their position to perform the\r\nduties of a clerk, and John of Athon considered the office of so much\r\nimportance that he gave the following advice to any one who held it:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: _Plumpton Correspondence_, Camden Society, 1839, P. 66,\r\n_temp_. Henry VII.]\r\n\r\n\"Whoever you may be, although the son of king, do not blush to go up to\r\nthe book in church, and read and sing; but if you know nothing of\r\nyourself, follow those who do know.\"\r\n\r\nIt is recorded in the chronicle of Ralph de Coggeshall that Richard I\r\nused to take great delight in divine service on the principal festivals;\r\ngoing hither and thither in the choir, encouraging the singers by voice\r\nand hand to sing louder. In the _Life of Sir Thomas More_, written by\r\nWilliam Roper, we find an account of that charming incident in the\r\ncareer of the great and worthy Lord Chancellor, when he was discovered\r\nby the Duke of Norfolk, who had come to Chelsea to dine with him,\r\nsinging in the choir and wearing a surplice during the service of the\r\nMass. After the conclusion of the service host and guest walked arm in\r\narm to the house of Sir Thomas More.\r\n\r\n\"God's body, my Lord Chancellor, what turned Parish Clerk? You dishonour\r\nthe King and his office very much,\" said the Duke.\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" replied Sir Thomas, smiling, \"your grace may not think that the\r\nKing, your master and mine, will be offended with me for serving his\r\nMaster, or thereby account his service any way dishonoured.\"\r\n\r\nWe will endeavour to sketch the daily and Sunday duties of a parish\r\nclerk, follow in his footsteps, and observe his manners and customs, as\r\nthey are set forth in mediæval documents.\r\n\r\nHe lived in a house near the church which was specially assigned to him,\r\nand often called the clerk's house. He had a garden and glebe. In the\r\nchurchwardens' accounts of St. Giles's Church, Reading, there is an item\r\nin 1542-3:--\"Paid for a latice to the clerkes hous ii s. x d.\" There was\r\na clerk's house in St. Mary's parish, in the same town, which is\r\nfrequently mentioned in the accounts (A.D. 1558-9).\r\n\r\n\"RESOLUTES for the guyet Rent of the Clerkes Howse xii d. 1559-60.\r\n\r\n\"RENTES to farme and at will. Of the tenement at Cornyshe Crosse called\r\nthe clerkes howse by the yere vi s. viii d.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears that the house was let, and the sum received for rent was\r\npart of the clerk's stipend. This is borne out by the following entry:--\r\n\r\n\"Md' that yt ys aggreed that the clerke most have for the office of the\r\nsexten But xx s. That ys for Ringing of the Bell vs for the quarter and\r\nthe clerkes wayges by the howse[22].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: _Churchwardens' Accounts of St. Mary's, Reading_, by\r\nF.N.A. and A.G. Garry, p. 42.]\r\n\r\nDoubtless there still remain many such houses attached to the clerkship,\r\nas in the Act of 7 & 8 Victoria, c. 59, sect. 6, it is expressly stated\r\nthat any clerk dismissed from his office shall give up any house,\r\nbuilding, land, or premises held or occupied by virtue or in respect of\r\nsuch office, and that if he fail to do so the bishop can take steps for\r\nhis ejection therefrom. Mr. Wickham Legg has collected several other\r\ninstances of the existence of clerks' houses. At St. Michael's\r\nWorcester, there was one, as in 1590 a sum was paid for mending it. At\r\nSt. Edmund's, Salisbury, the clerk had a house and garden in 1653. At\r\nBarton Turf, Norfolk, three acres are known as \"dog-whipper's land,\" the\r\ntask of whipping dogs out of churches being part of the clerk's duties,\r\nas we shall notice more particularly later on. The rent of this land was\r\ngiven to the clerk. At Saltwood, Kent, the clerk had a house and garden,\r\nwhich have recently been sold[23].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: _The Clerk's Book of 1549_, edited by J. Wickham Legg,\r\nlvi.]\r\n\r\nArchbishop Sancroft, at Fressingfield, caused a comfortable cottage to\r\nbe built for the parish clerk, and also a kind of hostelry for the\r\nshelter and accommodation of persons who came from a distant part of\r\nthat large scattered parish to attend the church, so that they might\r\nbring their cold provisions there, and take their luncheon in the\r\ninterval between the morning and the afternoon service.\r\n\r\nThere was a clerk's house at Ringmer. In the account of the beating of\r\nthe bounds of the parish in Rogation week, 1683, it is recorded that at\r\nthe close of the third day the procession arrived at the Crab Tree, when\r\nthe people sang a psalm, and \"our minister read the epistle and gospel,\r\nto request and supplicate the blessing of God upon the fruits of the\r\nearth. Then did Mr. Richard Gunn invite all the company to _the clerk's\r\nhouse_, where he expended at his own charge a barrell of beer, besides a\r\nplentiful supply of provisions: and so ended our third and last day's\r\nperambulation[24].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: _Social Life as told by Parish Registers_, by T.F.\r\nThiselton-Dyer, p. 197.]\r\n\r\nIn his little house the clerk lived and tended his garden when he was\r\nnot engaged upon his ecclesiastical duties. He was often a married man,\r\nalthough those who were intending to proceed to the higher orders in the\r\nChurch would naturally be celibate. Pope Gregory, in writing to St.\r\nAugustine of Canterbury, offered no objections to the marriage of\r\nclerks. Lyndewoode shows a preference for the unmarried clerk, but if\r\nsuch could not be found, a married clerk might perform his duties.\r\nNumerous wills are in existence which show that very frequently the\r\nclerk was blest with a wife, inasmuch as he left his goods to her; and\r\nin one instance, at Hull, John Huyk, in 1514, expresses his wish to be\r\nburied beside his wife in the wedding porch of the church[25].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Injunction by John Bishop of Norwich (1561), B. i b.,\r\nquoted by Mr. Legg in _The Parish Clerk's Book_, p. xlii.]\r\n\r\nOne courageous clerk's wife did good service to her husband, who had\r\ndared to speak insultingly of the high and mighty John of Gaunt. He held\r\noffice in the church of St. Peter-the-Less, in the City of London, in\r\n1378. His wife was so persevering in her behests and so constant in her\r\nappeals for justice, that she won her suit and obtained her husband's\r\nrelease[26].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Riley's _Memorials of London_, 1868, p. 425.]\r\n\r\nWe have the picture, then, of the mediæval clerk in his little house\r\nnigh the church surrounded by his wife and children, or as a bachelor\r\nintent upon preferment poring over his Missal, if he did not sometimes\r\nemulate the frivolous feats of Chaucer's \"Jolly Absolon.\"\r\n\r\nAt early dawn he sallied forth to perform his earliest duty of opening\r\nthe church doors and ringing the day-bell. The ringing of bells seems to\r\nhave been a fairly constant employment of the clerk, though in some\r\nchurches this duty was mainly performed by the sexton, but the aid of\r\nthe clerk was demanded whenever it was needed. According to the\r\nconstitution of the parish clerks at Trinity Church, Coventry, made in\r\n1462, he was ordered every day to open the church doors at 6 a.m., and\r\ndeliver to the priest who sang the Trinity Mass a book and a chalice and\r\nvestment, and when Mass was finished to see that these goods of the\r\nchurch be deposited in safety in the vestry. He had to ring all the\r\npeople in to Matins, together with his fellow-clerk, at every\r\ncommemoration and feast of IX lessons, and see that the books were ready\r\nfor the priest. Again for High Mass he rang and sang in the choir. At 3\r\np.m. he rang for Evensong, and sang the service in the south side of the\r\nchoir, his assistant occupying the north side. On weekdays they sang the\r\nPsalms and responses antiphonally, and on Sundays and holy-days acted as\r\n_rectores chori_, each one beginning the verses of the Psalms for his\r\nown side. He had to be very careful that the books were all securely\r\nlocked up in the vestry, and the church locked at a convenient hour,\r\nhaving searched the building to see lest any one was lying in any seat\r\nor corner. On Sundays and holidays he had to provide a clerk or \"dekyn\"\r\nto read the gospel at High Mass. The sweeping of the floor of the\r\nchurch, the cleaning of the leaden roofs, and sweeping away the snow\r\nfrom the gutters \"leste they be stoppyd,\" also came under his care. The\r\nbells he also kept in order, examining the clappers and bawdricks and\r\nropes, and reporting to the churchwardens if they required mending. His\r\nassistant had to grease the bells when necessary, and find the\r\nmaterials. He had to tend the lamp and to fetch oil and rychys\r\n(rushes), and fix banners on holidays, fold up the albs and vestments.\r\nOn Saturdays and on the eve of saints' days he had to ring the noon-tide\r\nbell, and to ring the sanctus bell every Sunday and holy-day, and during\r\nprocessions.\r\n\r\nSpecial seasons brought their special duties, and directions are\r\nminutely given with regard to every point to be observed. On Palm Sunday\r\nhe was ordered to set a form at the priory door for the stations of the\r\nCross, so that a crucifix or rood should be set there for the priest to\r\nsing _Ave rex_. He had to provide palms for that Sunday, watch the\r\nEaster sepulchre \"till the resurrecion be don,\" and then take down the\r\n\"lenten clothys\" about the altar and the rood. In Easter week, when a\r\nprocession was made, he bore the chrismatory. At the beginning of Lent\r\nhe was ordered to help the churchwardens to cover the altar and rood\r\nwith \"lentyn clothys\" and to hang the vail in the choir. The pulley\r\nwhich worked this vail is still to be seen in some churches, as at\r\nUffington, Berks. For this labour the churchwardens were to give money\r\nto the clerk for drink. The great bell had to be rung for compline every\r\nSaturday in Lent. At Easter and Whit-Sunday the clerk was required to\r\nhang a towel about the font, and see that three \"copys\" (copes) be\r\nbrought down to the font for the priests to sing _Rex sanctorum_.\r\n\r\nIt was evidently considered the duty of the churchwardens to deck the\r\nhigh altar for great festivals, but they were to have the assistance of\r\nthe clerk at the third peel of the first Evensong \"to aray the hye awter\r\nwith clothys necessary for it.\" Perhaps this duty of the churchwardens\r\nmight with advantage be revived.\r\n\r\nSheer Thursday or Maundy Thursday was a special day for cleansing the\r\naltars and font, which was done by a priest; but the clerk was required\r\nto provide a birch broom and also a barrel in order that water might be\r\nplaced in it for this purpose. On Easter Eve and the eve of Whit-Sunday\r\nthe ceremony of cleaning the altar and font was repeated. Flagellation\r\nwas not obsolete as a penance, and the clerk was expected to find three\r\ndiscipline rods.\r\n\r\nIn mediæval times it was a common practice for rich men to leave money\r\nor property to a church with the condition that Masses should be said\r\nfor the repose of their souls on certain days. The first Latin word of a\r\nverse in the funeral psalm was _dirige_ (\"direct my steps,\" etc.), and\r\nthis verse was used as an antiphon to those psalms in the old English\r\nservice for the dead. Hence the service was called a _dirige_, and we\r\nfind mention of \"Master Meynley's dirige,\" or as it is spelt often\r\n\"derege,\" the origin of the word \"dirge.\" Those who attended were often\r\nregaled with refreshments--bread and ale--and the clerk's duty was to\r\nserve them with these things.\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to his obligations as regards his bearing of\r\nholy water to the parishioners, a duty which brought him into close\r\nrelationship with them. Another custom which has long since passed away\r\nwas that of blessing a loaf of bread by the priest, and distributing\r\nportions of it to the parishioners. Sometimes this distribution took\r\nplace in church, as at Coventry, where one of the clerks, having seen\r\nthe loaf duly cut, gave portions of it to the assembled worshippers in\r\nthe south aisle, and the other clerk performed a like duty in the north\r\naisle. The clerk received some small fee for this service, usually a\r\nhalfpenny. Berkshire has several evidences of the existence of the\r\nholy loaf.\r\n\r\nIn the accounts of St. Lawrence's Church, Reading, in 1551, occurs the\r\nfollowing notice:\r\n\r\n\"At this day it was concluded and agreed that from henceforth every\r\ninhabitant of the parish shall bear and pay every Sunday in the year 5\r\nd. for every tenement as of old time the Holy Loaf was used to be paid\r\nand be received by the parish clerk weekly, the said clerk to have every\r\nSunday for his pains 1 d. And 4 d. residue to be paid and delivered\r\nevery Sunday to the churchwardens to be employed for bread and wine for\r\nthe communion. And if any overplus thereof shall be of such money so\r\nreceived, to be to the use of the church; and if any shall lack, to be\r\nborne and paid by the said churchwardens: provided always, that all such\r\npersons as are poor and not able to pay the whole, be to have aid of\r\nsuch others as shall be thought good by the discretion of the\r\nchurchwardens.\"\r\n\r\nWith the advent of Queen Mary the old custom was reverted to, as the\r\nfollowing item for the year 1555 plainly shows:\r\n\r\n\"Rec. of money gathered for the holy lofe ix s. iiij d.\"\r\n\r\nAt St. Mary's Church there is a constant allusion to this practice from\r\nthe year 1566-7 to 1617-18, after which date the payment for the\r\n\"holilofe\" seems to have been merged in the charge for seats. In 1567-8\r\nthe following resolution was passed:\r\n\r\n\"It is agreed that the clerk shall hereafter gather the Holy Loaf money,\r\nor else to have nothing of that money, and to gather all, or else to\r\ninform the parish of them that will not pay.\"\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been some difficulty in collecting this money; so it\r\nwas agreed in 1579-80 that \"John Marshall shall every month in the year\r\nduring the time that he shall be clerk, gather the holy loaf and thereof\r\nyield an account to the churchwardens.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSubsequently we constantly meet with such records as the following:\r\n\r\n\"It'm for the holy loffe xiii s. vi d.\"\r\n\r\nUltimately, however, this mode of collecting money for the providing of\r\nthe sacred elements and defraying other expenses of the church was, as\r\nwe have said, abandoned in favour of pew-rents. The clerk had long\r\nceased to obtain any benefit from the custom of collecting this curious\r\nform of subscription to the parochial expenses.\r\n\r\nAn interesting document exists in the parish of Stanford-in-the-Vale,\r\nBerkshire, relating to the holy loaf. It was evidently written during\r\nthe reign of Queen Mary, and runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Here following is the order of the giving of the loaves to make holy\r\nbread with videlicit of when it beginneth and endeth, what the whole\r\nvalue is, in what portions it is divided, and to whom the portions be\r\ndue, and though it be written in the fifth part of the division of the\r\nbook before in the beginning with these words (how money shall be paid\r\ntowards the charges of the communion) ye shall understand that in the\r\ntime of the Schism when this Realm was divided from the Catholic Church,\r\nthe which was in the year of our Lord God in 1547, in the second year of\r\nKing Edward the Sixth, all godly ceremonies and good uses were taken out\r\nof the church within this Realm, and then the money that was bestowed on\r\nthe holy bread was turned to the use of finding bread and wine for the\r\ncommunion, and then the old order being brought unto his [its] pristine\r\nstate before this book was written causeth me to write with this\r\nterm[27].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: The spelling of the words I have ventured to modernise.]\r\n\r\nThe order of the giving of the loaves is then set forth, beginning at a\r\npiece of ground called Ganders and continuing throughout the parish,\r\ntogether with names of the parishioners. The collecting of this sum must\r\nhave been an arduous part of the clerk's duty. \"And thus I make an end\r\nof this matter,\" as the worthy clergyman at Stanford-in-the-Vale wrote\r\nat the conclusion of his carefully drawn up document[28].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: A relic of this custom existed in a small town in Dorset\r\nfifty years ago. At Easter the clerk used to leave at the house of each\r\npew-holder a packet of Easter cakes--thin wafery biscuits, not unlike\r\nJewish Pass-over cakes. The packet varied according to the size of the\r\nfamily and the depth of the master's purse. When the fussy little clerk\r\ncalled for his Easter offering, at one house he found 5 s. waiting for\r\nhim, as a kind of payment for five cakes. The shilling's were quickly\r\ntransferred to the clerk's pocket, who remarked, \"Five shilling's is\r\nhandsome for the clerk, sir; but the vicar only takes gold.\"\r\n\r\nThe custom of the clerk carrying round the parish Easter cakes prevailed\r\nalso at Milverton, Somerset, and at Langport in the same county.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to his regular wages and to the dues received for delivering\r\nholy water and in connection with the holy loaf, the clerk enjoyed\r\nsundry other perquisites. At Christmas he received a loaf from every\r\nhouse, a certain number of eggs at Easter, and some sheaves when the\r\nharvest was gathered in. Among the documents in the parish chest at\r\nMorebath there is a very curious manuscript relating to a prolonged\r\nquarrel with regard to the dues to be paid to the clerk. This took place\r\nin the year 1531 and lasted until 1536. This document throws much light\r\non the customary fees and gifts paid to the holder of this office. After\r\nendless wrangling the parishioners decided that the clerk should have \"a\r\nsteche of clene corn\" from every household, if there should be any corn;\r\nif not, a \"steche of wotis\" (oats), or 3 d. in lieu of corn. Also 1 d.\r\na quarter from every household; at every wedding and funeral 2 d.; at\r\nshearing time enough wool for a coat. Moreover, it was agreed that he\r\nshould have a clerk's ale in the church house. It is well known that\r\nchurch ales were very common in medieval times, when the churchwardens\r\nbought, and received presents of, a large quantity of malt which they\r\nbrewed into beer. The village folk collected other provisions, and\r\nassembled in the church house, where there were spits and crocks and\r\nother utensils for dressing a feast. Old and young gathered together;\r\nthe churchwardens' ale was sold freely. The young folk danced, or played\r\nat bowls or practised archery, the old people looking gravely on and\r\nenjoying the merry-making. Such were the old church ales, the proceeds\r\nof which were devoted to the maintenance of the poor or some other\r\nworthy object. An arbour of boughs was erected in the churchyard called\r\nRobin Hood's Bower, where the maidens collected money for the \"ales.\"\r\nThe clerk in some parishes, as at Morebath, had \"an ale\" at Easter, and\r\nit was agreed that \"the parish should help to drink him a cost of ale in\r\nthe church house,\" which duty doubtless the village folk carried out\r\nwith much willingness and regularity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD CHURCH-HOUSE AT HURST. BERKSHIRE NOW THE CASTLE\r\nINN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD CHURCH-HOUSE AT UFFINGTON. BERKS NOW USED AS A\r\nSCHOOL]\r\n\r\nPuritanism gradually killed these \"ales.\" Sabbatarianism lifted up its\r\nvoice against them. The gatherings waxed merry, sometimes too merry, so\r\nthe stern Puritan thought, and the ballad-singer sang profane songs, and\r\nthe maidens danced with light-footed step, and it was all very wrong\r\nbecause they were breaking the Sabbath; and the ale was strong, and\r\nsometimes people drank too much, so the critics said. But all\r\nreasonable and sober-minded folk were not opposed to them, and in\r\nreply to some inquiries instituted by Archbishop Laud, the Bishop of\r\nBath and Wells made the following report:\r\n\r\n     \"Touching clerke-ales (which are lesser church-ales) for the\r\n     better maintenance of Parish-clerks they have been used\r\n     (until of late) in divers places, and there was great reason\r\n     for them; for in poor country parishes, where the wages of\r\n     the clerk is very small, the people thinking it unfit that\r\n     the clerk should duly attend at church and lose by his\r\n     office, were wont to send in Provisions, and then feast with\r\n     him, and give him more liberality than their quarterly\r\n     payments would amount unto in many years. And since these\r\n     have been put down, some ministers have complained unto me,\r\n     that they are afraid they shall have no parish clerks for\r\n     want of maintenance for them.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wickham Legg has investigated the subsequent history of this good\r\nBishop Pierce, and shows how the Puritans when they were in power used\r\nthis reply as a means of accusation against him, whereby they attempted\r\nto prove that \"he profanely opposed the sanctification of the Lord's Day\r\nby approving and allowing of profane wakes and revels on that day,\" and\r\nwas \"a desperately profane, impious, and turbulent Pilate.\"\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the incomes of the clergy were severely taxed by\r\nthe Pope, who demanded annates or first-fruits of one year's value on\r\nall benefices and sundry other exactions. The poor clerk's salary did\r\nnot always escape from the rapacity of the Pope's collectors, as the\r\nstory told by Matthew Paris clearly sets forth:\r\n\r\n\"It happened that an agent of the Pope met a petty clerk carrying water\r\nin a little vessel, with a sprinkler and some bits of bread given him\r\nfor having sprinkled some holy water, and to him the deceitful Roman\r\nthus addressed himself:\r\n\r\n\"'How much does the profits yielded to you by this church amount to in a\r\nyear?' To which the clerk, ignorant of the Roman's cunning, replied:\r\n\r\n\"'To twenty shillings, I think.'\r\n\r\n\"Whereupon the agent demanded the percentage the Pope had just demanded\r\non all ecclesiastical benefices. And to pay that sum this poor man was\r\ncompelled to hold school for many days, and by selling his books in the\r\nprecincts, to drag on a half-starved life.\"\r\n\r\nThis story discloses another duty which fell to the lot of the mediæval\r\nclerk. He was the parish schoolmaster--at least in some cases. The\r\ndecretals of Gregory IX require that he should have enough learning in\r\norder to enable him to keep a school, and that the parishioners should\r\nsend their children to him to be taught in the church. There is not much\r\nevidence of the carrying out of this rule, but here and there we find\r\nallusions to this part of a clerk's duties. Inasmuch as this may have\r\nbeen regarded as an occupation somewhat separate from his ordinary\r\nduties as regards the church, perhaps we should not expect to find\r\nconstant allusion to it. However, Archbishop Peckham ordered, in 1280,\r\nthat in the church of Bakewell and the chapels annexed to it there\r\nshould be _duos clericos scholasticos_ carefully chosen by the\r\nparishioners, from whose alms they would have to live, who should carry\r\nholy water round in the parish and chapels on Lord's Days and\r\nfestivals, and minister _in divinis officiis_, and on weekdays should\r\nkeep school[29]. It is said that Alexander, Bishop of Coventry, in 1237,\r\ndirected that there should be in country villages parish clerks who\r\nshould be schoolmasters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: If that is the correct translation of _profestis diebus\r\ndisciplinis scolasticis indulgentes_. Dr. Legg thinks that it may refer\r\nto their own education.]\r\n\r\nIt is certain--for the churchwarden accounts bear witness to the\r\nfact--that in several parishes the clerks performed this duty of\r\nteaching. Thus in the accounts of the church of St. Giles, Reading,\r\noccurs the following:\r\n\r\n     Pay'd to Whitborne the clerk towards his wages and he to be\r\n     bound to teach ij children for the choir ... xij s.\r\n\r\nAt Faversham, in 1506, it was ordered that \"the clerks or one of them,\r\nas much as in them is, shall endeavour themselves to teach children to\r\nread and sing in the choir, and to do service in the church as of old\r\ntime hath been accustomed, they taking for their teaching as belongeth\r\nthereto\"; and at the church of St. Nicholas, Bristol, in 1481, this duty\r\nof teaching is implied in the order that the clerk ought not to take any\r\nbook out of the choir for children to learn in without licence of the\r\nprocurators. We may conclude, therefore, that the task of teaching the\r\nchildren of the parish not unusually devolved upon the clerk, and that\r\nsome knowledge of Latin formed part of the instruction given, which\r\nwould be essential for those who took part in the services of\r\nthe church.\r\n\r\nNor were his labours yet finished. In John Myrc's _Instructions to\r\nParish Priests_, a poem written not later than 1450, a treatise\r\ncontaining good sound morality, and a good sight of the ecclesiastical\r\ncustoms of the Middle Ages, we find the following lines:\r\n\r\n     \"When thou shalt to seke[30] _gon_\r\n     Hye thee fast and _go_ a-non;\r\n     For if thou tarry thou dost amiss,\r\n     Thou shalt guyte[31] that soul I wys.\r\n     When thou shalt to seke gon,\r\n     A clene surples caste thee on;\r\n     Take thy stole with thee ry't,[32]\r\n     And put thy hod ouer thy sy't[33]\r\n     Bere thyne ost[34] a-nout thy breste\r\n     In a box that is honeste;\r\n     Make thy clerk before thee synge,\r\n     To bere light and belle ringe.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: Sick.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Quiet.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Right.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Sight.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Host.]\r\n\r\nIt was customary, therefore, for the clerk to accompany the priest to\r\nthe house of the sick person, when the clergyman went to administer the\r\nLast Sacrament or to visit the suffering. The clerk was required to\r\ncarry a lighted candle and ring a bell, and an ancient MS. of the\r\nfourteenth century represents him marching before the priest bearing his\r\nlight and his bell. In some town parishes he was ordered always to be at\r\nhand ready to accompany the priest on his errands of mercy. It was a\r\ngrievous offence for a clerk to be absent from this duty. In the parish\r\nof St. Stephen's, Coleman Street, the clerks were not allowed \"to go or\r\nride out of the town without special licence had of the vicar and\r\nchurchwardens, and at no time were they to be out of the way, but one of\r\nthem had always to be ready to minister sacraments and sacramentals, and\r\nto wait upon the Curate and to give him warning.\" This custom of the\r\nclerk accompanying the priest when visiting the sick was not abolished\r\nat the Reformation. _The Parish Clerk's Guide_, published by the\r\nWorshipful Company of Parish Clerks in 1731, the history of which it\r\nwill be our privilege to investigate, states that the holders of the\r\noffice \"are always conversant in Holy Places and Holy Things, such as\r\nare the Holy Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper; yea and in the\r\nmost serious Things too, such as the Visitation of the Sick, when we do\r\noften attend, and at the Burial of the Dead.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CLERK ACCOMPANYING THE PRIEST WHEN VISITING THE SICK]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CLERK ATTENDING THE PRIEST, WHO IS ADMINISTERING THE\r\nLAST SACRAMENT]\r\n\r\nOccupied with these numerous duties, engaged in a service which\r\ndelighted him, his time could never have hung heavy on his hands.\r\nFaithful in his dutiful services to his rector, beloved by the\r\nparishioners, a welcome guest in cot and hall, and serving God with all\r\nhis heart, according to his lights, he could doubtless exclaim with\r\nDavid, _Laetus sorte mea_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE DUTIES OF READING AND SINGING\r\n\r\nThe clerk's highest privilege in pre-Reformation times was to take his\r\npart in the great services of the church. His functions were very\r\nimportant, and required considerable learning and skill. When the songs\r\nof praise echoed through the vaulted aisles of the great church, his\r\nvoice was heard loud and clear leading the choirmen and chanting the\r\nopening words of the Psalm. As early as the time of St. Gregory this\r\nduty was required of him. In giving directions to St. Augustine of\r\nCanterbury the Pope ordered that clerks should be diligent in singing\r\nthe Psalms. In the ninth century Pope Leo IV directed that the clerks\r\nshould read the Psalms in divine service, and in 878 Archbishop Hincmar\r\nof Rheims issued some articles of inquiry to his Rural Deans, asking,\r\namong other questions, \"Whether the presbyter has a clerk who can keep\r\nschool, or read the epistle, or is able to sing as far as may seem\r\nneedful to him?\"\r\n\r\nA canon of the Council of Nantes, embodied in the Decretals of Pope\r\nGregory IX, settled definitely that every presbyter who has charge of a\r\nparish should have a clerk, who should sing with him and read the\r\nepistle and lesson, and who should be able to keep school and admonish\r\nthe parishioners to send their children to church to learn the\r\nfaith[35]. This ordinance was binding upon the Church in this country as\r\nin other parts of Western Christendom, and William Lyndewoode, Official\r\nPrincipal of the Archbishop of Canterbury, when laying down the law with\r\nregard to the marriage of clerks, states that the clerk has \"to wait on\r\nthe priest at the altar, to sing with him, and to read the epistle.\" A\r\nnotable quarrel between two clerks, which is recorded by John of Athon\r\nwriting in the years 1333-1348, gives much information upon various\r\npoints of ecclesiastical usage and custom. The account says:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: Decr. Greg. IX. Lib. III. tit. i. cap. iii., quoted by Dr.\r\nCuthbert Atchley in _Alcuin Club Tracts_, IV.]\r\n\r\n\"Lately, when two clerks were contending about the carrying of holy\r\nwater, the clerk appointed by the parishioners against the command of\r\nthe priest, wrenched the book from the hands of the clerk who had been\r\nappointed by the rector, and who had been ordered to read the epistle by\r\nthe priest, and hurled him violently to the ground, drawing blood[36].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: John of Athon, _Constit. Dom. Othoboni_, tit. _De\r\nresidentia archipreb. et episc._: cap. _Pastor bonus_: verb _sanctæ\r\nobedientiæ_.]\r\n\r\nA very unseemly disturbance truly! Two clerks righting for the book in\r\nthe midst of the sanctuary during the Eucharistic service! Still their\r\nquarrel teaches us something about the appointment and election of\r\nclerks in the Middle Ages, and of the duty of the parish clerk with\r\nregard to the reading of the epistle.\r\n\r\nIn 1411 the vicar of Elmstead was enjoined by Clifford, Bishop of\r\nLondon, to find a clerk to help him at private Masses on weekdays, and\r\non holy days to read the epistle.\r\n\r\nIn the rules laid down for the guidance of clerks at the various\r\nchurches we find many references to the duties of reading and singing.\r\nAt Coventry he is required to sing in the choir at the Mass, and to sing\r\nEvensong on the south side of the choir; on feast days the first clerk\r\nwas ordered to be _rector chori_ on the south side, while his fellow\r\nperformed a like duty on the north side. On every Sunday and holy day\r\nthe latter had to read the epistle. At Faversham the clerk was required\r\nto sing at every Mass by note the Grail at the upper desk in the body of\r\nthe choir, and also the epistle, and to be diligent to sing all the\r\noffice of the Mass by note, and at all other services. Very careful\r\ninstructions were laid down for the proper musical arrangements in this\r\nchurch. The clerk was ordered \"to set the choir not after his own brest\r\n(= voice) but as every man being a singer may sing conveniently his\r\npart, and when plain song faileth one of the clerks shall leave\r\nfaburdon[37] and keep plain song unto the time the choir be set again.\"\r\nA fine of 2 d. was levied on all clerks as well as priests at St.\r\nMichael's, Cornhill, who should be absent from the church, and not take\r\ntheir places in the choir in their surplices, singing there from the\r\nbeginning of Matins, Mass and Evensong unto the end of the services. At\r\nSt. Nicholas, Bristol, the clerk was ordered \"to sing in reading the\r\nepistle daily under pain of ii d.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: _Faburdon_ = faux-bourdon, a simple kind of counterpoint\r\nto the church plain song-, much used in England in the fifteenth\r\ncentury. Grove's _Dictionary of Music_.]\r\n\r\nThese various rules and regulations, drawn up with consummate care,\r\ntogether with the occasional glimpses of the mediæval clerk and his\r\nduties, which old writers afford, enable us to picture to ourselves what\r\nkind of person he was, and to see him engaged in his manifold\r\noccupations within the same walls which we know so well. When the\r\ndaylight is dying, musing within the dim mysterious aisle, we can see\r\nhim folding up the vestments, bearing the books into their place of safe\r\nkeeping in the vestry, singing softly to himself:\r\n\r\n     \"_Et introibo ad altare Dei; ad Deum qui loetificat\r\n     juventutem meam_.\"\r\n\r\nThe scene changes. The days of sweeping reform set in. The Church of\r\nEngland regained her ancient independence and was delivered from a\r\nforeign yoke. Her children obtained an open Bible, and a liturgy in\r\ntheir own mother-tongue. But she was distressed and despoiled by the\r\nrapacity of the commissioners of the Crown, by such wretches as\r\nProtector Somerset, Dudley and the rest, private peculation eclipsing\r\nthe greediness of royal officials. Froude draws a sad picture of the\r\nhalls of country houses hung with altar cloths, tables and beds quilted\r\nwith copes, and knights and squires drinking their claret out of\r\nchalices and watering their horses in marble coffins. No wonder there\r\nwas discontent among the people. No wonder they disliked the despoiling\r\nof their heritage for the enrichment of the Dudleys and the _nouveaux\r\nriches_ who fattened on the spoils of the monasteries, and left the\r\nchurch bare of brass and ornament, chalice and vestment, the\r\naccumulation of years of the pious offerings of the faithful. No wonder\r\nthere were risings and riots, quelled only by the stern and powerful\r\nhand of a Tudor despot.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all the changes that were wrought in that tumultuous\r\ntime, the parish clerk remained, and continued to discharge many of the\r\nfunctions which had fallen to his lot before the Reformation had begun.\r\nAs I have already stated, his duties with regard to bearing holy water\r\nand the holy loaf were discontinued, although the collecting of money\r\nfrom the parishioners was conducted in much the same way as before, and\r\nthe \"holy loaf\" corrupted into various forms--such as \"holy looff,\"\r\n\"holie loffe,\" \"holy cake,\" etc.--appears in churchwardens' account\r\nbooks as late as the beginning of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nAs regards his main duties of reading and singing we find that they were\r\nby no means discontinued. From a study of the First Prayer Book of\r\nEdward VI, it is evident that his voice was still to be heard reading in\r\nreverent tones the sacred words of Holy Scripture, and chanting the\r\nPsalms in his mother-tongue instead of in that of the Vulgate. The\r\nrubric in the communion service immediately before the epistle directs\r\nthat \"the collectes ended, the priest, or he that is appointed, shall\r\nread the epistle, in a place assigned for the purpose.\" Who is the\r\nperson signified by the phrase \"he that is appointed\"? That question is\r\ndecided for us by _The Clerk's Book_ recently edited by Dr. J. Wickham\r\nLegg, wherein it is stated that \"the priest or clerk\" shall read the\r\nepistle. The injunctions of 1547 interpret for us the meaning of \"the\r\nplace assigned for the purpose\" as being \"the pulpit or such convenient\r\nplace as people may hear.\" Ability to read the epistle was still\r\ntherefore considered part of the functions of a parish clerk, and the\r\nwhole lesson derived from a study of _The Clerk's Book_ is the very\r\nimportant part which he took in the services. As the title of the book\r\nshows, it contains \"All that appertein to the clerkes to say or syng at\r\nthe Ministracion of the Communion, and when there is no Communion. At\r\nConfirmacion. At Matrimonie. The Visitacion of the Sicke. The Buriall of\r\nthe Dedde. At the Purification of Women. And the first daie of Lent.\"\r\n\r\nHe began the service of Holy Communion by singing the Psalm appointed\r\nfor the introit. In the book only the first words of the part taken by\r\nthe priest are given, whereas all the clerk's part is printed in full.\r\nHe leads the responses in the Lesser Litany, the _Gloria in excelsis_,\r\nthe Nicene Creed. He reads the offertory sentences and says the _Ter\r\nSanctus_, sings or says the _Agnus Dei_, besides the responses. In the\r\nMarriage Service he said or sang the Psalm with the priest, and\r\nresponded diligently. As in pre-Reformation times he accompanied the\r\npriest in the visitation of the sick, and besides making the responses\r\nsang the anthems, \"Remember not, Lord, our iniquities,\" etc., and \"O\r\nSaviour of the world, save us, which by thy crosse and precious blood\r\nhast redeemed us, help us, we beseech thee, O God.\" In the Communion of\r\nthe Sick the epistle is written out in full, showing that it was the\r\nclerk's privilege to read it. A great part of the service for the Burial\r\nof the Dead was ordered to be said or sung by the \"priest or clerk,\" and\r\n\"at the communion when there was a burial\" he apparently sang the\r\nintroit and read the epistle. In the Communion Service the clerk with\r\nthe priest said the fifty-first Psalm and the anthem, \"Turn thou us, O\r\ngood Lord,\" etc. In Matins and Evensong the clerk sang the Psalms and\r\ncanticles and made responses, and from other sources we gather that he\r\nused to read either one or both of the lessons. In some churches he was\r\ncalled the dekyn or deacon, and at Ludlow, in 1551, he received 3 s. 4\r\nd. for reading the first lesson.\r\n\r\nIn the accounts of St. Margaret's, Westminster, there is an item in the\r\nyear 1553 for the repair of the pulpit where, it is stated, \"the curate\r\nand the clark did read the chapters at service time.\"\r\n\r\nArchbishop Grindal, in 1571, laid down the following injunction for his\r\nprovince of York: \"That no parish clerk be appointed against the\r\ngoodwill or without the consent of the parson, vicar, or curate of any\r\nparish, and that he be obedient to the parson, vicar, and curate,\r\nspecially in the time of celebration of divine service or of sacraments,\r\nor in any preparation thereunto; and that he be able also to read the\r\nfirst lesson, the Epistle, and the Psalms, with answers to the suffrages\r\nas is used, and also that he endeavour himself to teach young children\r\nto read, if he be able so to do.\" When this archbishop was translated to\r\nCanterbury he issued very similar injunctions in the southern province.\r\nOther bishops followed his example, and issued questions in their\r\ndioceses relating to clerkly duties, and these injunctions show that to\r\nread the first lesson and the epistle and to sing the Psalms constituted\r\nthe principal functions of a parish clerk.\r\n\r\nEvidences of the continuance of this practice are not wanting[38].\r\nIndeed, within the memory of living men at one church at least the\r\ncustom was observed. At Keighley, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, some\r\nthirty or forty years ago the parish clerk wore a black gown and bands.\r\nHe read the first lesson and the epistle. To read the latter he left his\r\nseat below the pulpit and went up to the altar and took down the book:\r\nafter reading the epistle within the altar rails he replaced the book\r\nand returned to his place. At Wimborne Minster the clerk used to read\r\nthe Lessons.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: cf. _The Parish Clerk's Book_, edited by Dr. J. Wickham\r\nLegg, F.S.A., and _The Parish Clerk and his right to read the Liturgical\r\nEpistle_, by Cuthbert Atchley, L.R.C.P., M.R.C.S. _(Alcuin Club\r\nTracts_, IV).]\r\n\r\nAlthough it is evident that at the present time the clerk has a right to\r\nread the epistle and one of the lessons, as well as the Psalms and\r\nresponses when they are not sung, it was perhaps necessary that his\r\nefforts in this direction should have been curtailed. When we remember\r\nthe extraordinary blunders made by many holders of the office in the\r\nlast century, their lack of education, and strange pronunciation, we\r\nshould hardly care to hear the mutilation of Holy Scripture which must\r\nhave followed the continuance of the practice. Would it not be possible\r\nto find men qualified to hold the office of parish clerk by education\r\nand powers of elocution who could revive the ancient practice with\r\nadvantage to the church both to the clergyman and the people?\r\n\r\nComplaints about the eccentricities and defective reading and singing of\r\nclerks have come down to us from Jacobean times. There was one Thomas\r\nMilborne, clerk of Eastham, who was guilty of several enormities;\r\namongst others, \"for that he singeth the psalms in the church with such\r\na jesticulous tone and altisonant voice, viz: squeaking like a gelded\r\npig, which doth not only interrupt the other voices, but is altogether\r\ndissonant and disagreeing unto any musical harmony, and he hath been\r\nrequested by the minister to leave it, but he doth obstinately persist\r\nand continue therein.\" Verily Master Milborne must have been a sore\r\ntrial to his vicar, almost as great as the clerk of Buxted, Sussex, was\r\nto his rector, who records in the parish register with a sigh of relief\r\nhis death, \"whose melody warbled forth as if he had been thumped on the\r\nback with a stone.\"\r\n\r\nThe Puritan regime was not conducive to this improvement of the status\r\nor education of the clerk or the cultivation of his musical abilities.\r\nThe Protectorate was a period of musical darkness. The organs of the\r\ncathedrals and colleges were taken down; the choirs were dispersed,\r\nmusical publications ceased, and the gradual twilight of the art, which\r\ncommenced with the accession of the Stuarts, faded into darkness. Many\r\nclerks, especially in the City of London, deserve the highest honour for\r\nhaving endeavoured to preserve the true taste for musical services in a\r\ndark age. Notable amongst these was John Playford, clerk of the Temple\r\nChurch in 1652. Benjamin Payne, clerk of St. Anne's, Blackfriars, in\r\n1685, the author of _The Parish Clerk's Guide_, wrote of Playford as\r\n\"one to whose memory all parish clerks owe perpetual thanks for their\r\nfurtherance in the knowledge of psalmody.\" The _History of Music_, by\r\nHawkins, describes him as \"an honest and friendly man, a good judge of\r\nmusic, with some skill in composition. He contributed not a little to\r\nthe art of printing music from letterpress types. He is looked upon as\r\nthe father of modern psalmody, and it does not appear that the practice\r\nhas much improved.\" The account which Playford gives of the clerks of\r\nhis day is not very satisfactory, and their sorry condition is\r\nattributed to \"the late wars\" and the confusion of the times. He says:\r\n\r\n\"In and about this great city, in above a hundred parishes there are but\r\nfew parish clerks to be found that have either ear or understanding to\r\nset one of these tunes musically, as it ought to be, it having been a\r\ncustom during the late wars, and since, to chuse men into such places\r\nmore for their poverty than skill and ability, whereby that part of\r\nGod's service hath been so ridiculously performed in most places, that\r\nit is now brought into scorn and derision by many people.\" He goes on to\r\ntell us that \"the ancient practice of singing the psalms in church was\r\nfor the clerk to repeat each line, probably because, at the first\r\nintroduction of psalms into our service great numbers of the common\r\npeople were unable to read.\" The author of _The Parish Clerk's Guide_\r\nstates that \"since faction prevailed in the Church, and troubles in the\r\nState, Church music has laboured under inevitable prejudices, more\r\nespecially by its being decried by some misguided and peevish sectaries\r\nas popery and anti-Christ, and so the minds of the common people are\r\nalienated from Church music, although performed by men of the greatest\r\nskill and judgment, under whom was wont to be trained up abundance of\r\nyouth in the respective cathedrals, that did stock the whole kingdom at\r\none time with good and able songsters.\" The Company of Parish Clerks of\r\nLondon [to the history and records of which we shall have occasion\r\nfrequently to refer] did good service in promoting the musical training\r\nof the members and in upholding the dignity of their important office.\r\nIn the edition of _The Parish Clerk's Guide_ for 1731, the writer\r\nlaments over the diminished status of his order, and states that \"the\r\nclerk is oftentimes chosen rather for his poverty, to prevent a charge\r\nto the parish, than either for his virtue or skill; or else for some\r\nby-end or purpose, more than for the immediate Honour and Service of\r\nAlmighty God and His Church.\"\r\n\r\nIf that was the case in rich and populous London parishes, how much more\r\nwas it true in poor village churches? Hence arose the race of country\r\nclerks who stumbled over and miscalled the hard words as they occurred\r\nin the Psalms, who sang in a strange and weird fashion, and brought\r\ndiscredit on their office. Indeed, the clergy were not always above\r\nsuspicion in the matter of reading, and even now they have their\r\ndetractors, who assert that it is often impossible to hear what they\r\nsay, that they read in a strained unnatural voice, and are generally\r\nunintelligible. At any rate, modern clergy are not so deficient in\r\neducation as they were in the early years of Queen Elizabeth, when, as\r\nFuller states in his _Triple Reconciler_, they were commanded \"to read\r\nthe chapters over once or twice by themselves that so they might be the\r\nbetter enabled to read them distinctly to the congregation.\" If the\r\nclergy were not infallible in the matter of the pronunciation of\r\ndifficult words, it is not surprising that the clerk often puzzled or\r\namused his hearers, and mangled or skipped the proper names, after the\r\nfashion of the mistress of a dame-school, who was wont to say when a\r\nsmall pupil paused at such a name as Nebuchadnezzar, \"That's a bad word,\r\nchild! go on to the next verse.\"\r\n\r\nOf the mistakes in the clerk's reading of the Psalms there are many\r\ninstances. David Diggs, the hero of J. Hewett's _Parish Clerk_, was\r\nremonstrated with for reading the proper names in Psalm lxxxiii. 6,\r\n\"Odommities, Osmallities, and Mobbities,\" and replied: \"Yes, no doubt,\r\nbut that's noigh enow. Seatown folk understand oi very well.\"\r\n\r\nHe is also reported to have said, \"Jeball, Amon, and Almanac, three\r\nPhilistines with them that are tired.\" The vicar endeavoured to teach\r\nhim the correct mode of pronunciation of difficult words, and for some\r\nweeks he read well, and then returned to his former method of making a\r\nshot at the proper names.\r\n\r\nOn being expostulated with he coolly replied:\r\n\r\n\"One on us must read better than t'other, or there wouldn't be no\r\ndifference 'twixt parson and clerk; so I gives in to you. Besides, this\r\nsort of reading as you taught me would not do here. The p'rishioners\r\ntold oi, if oi didn't gi' in and read in th' old style loike, as they\r\nwouldn't come to hear oi, so oi dropped it!\"\r\n\r\nAn old clerk at Hartlepool, who had been a sailor, used to render Psalm\r\nciv. 26, as \"There go the ships and there is that lieutenant whom Thou\r\nhast made to take his pastime therein.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leviathan\" has been responsible for many errors. A shoemaker clerk used\r\nto call it \"that great leather-thing.\" From various sources comes to me\r\nthe story, to which I have already referred, of the transformation of\r\n\"an alien to my mother's children\" into \"a lion to my mother's\r\nchildren.\"\r\n\r\nA clerk at Bletchley always called caterpillars _saterpillars_, and in\r\nPsalm lxviii. never read JAH, but spelt it J-A-H. He used to summon the\r\nchildren from their places to stand in single file along the pews during\r\nthree Sundays in Lent, and say, \"Children, say your catechayse.\"\r\n\r\nCatechising during the service seems to have been not uncommon. The\r\nclerk at Milverton used to summon the children, calling out, \"Children,\r\ncatechise, pray draw near.\"\r\n\r\nThe clerk at Sidbury used to read, \"Better than a bullock that has horns\r\n_enough_\"; his name was Timothy Karslake, commonly called \"Tim,\" and\r\nwhen he made a mistake in the responses some one in the church would\r\ncall out, \"You be wrong, Tim.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes a little emphasis on the wrong word was used to express the\r\nfeelings engendered by private piques and quarrels. There were in one\r\nparish some differences between the parson and the clerk, who showed his\r\nindependence and proud spirit when he read the verse of the Psalm, \"If I\r\n_be_ hungry, I will not tell _thee_,\" casting a rather scornful glance\r\nat the parson.\r\n\r\nAnother specimen of his class used to read \"Ananias, Azarias, and\r\nMizzle,\" and one who was reading a lesson in church (Isaiah liv. 12),\r\n\"And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles,\"\r\nrendered the verse, \"Thy window of a gate, and thy gates of\r\ncrab ancles.\"\r\n\r\nAnother clerk who was \"not much of a scholard\" used to allow no\r\ndifficulty to check his fluency. If the right word did not fall to his\r\nhand he made shift with another of somewhat similar sound, the result\r\nfrequently taxing to the uttermost the self-control of the better\r\neducated among his hearers. He was ill-mated to a shrewish wife, and one\r\nwas sensible of a thrill of sympathy when, without a thought of\r\nirreverence, and in all simplicity, he rolled out, instead of \"Woe is\r\nme, that I am constrained to dwell with Mesech!\" \"Woe is me, that I am\r\nconstrained to dwell with _Missis_!\"\r\n\r\nOld age at length puts an end to the power of the most stalwart clerks.\r\nThat must have been a very pathetic scene in the church at East Barnet\r\nwhich few of those present could have witnessed without emotion. The\r\nclerk was a man of advanced age. He always conducted the singing, which\r\nmust have been somewhat monotonous, as the 95th and the 100th Psalm (Old\r\nVersion) were invariably sung. On one occasion, after several vain\r\nattempts to begin the accustomed melody, the poor old man exclaimed,\r\n\"Well, my friends, it's no use. I'm too old. I can't sing any more.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD BECKENHAM CHURCH]\r\n\r\nIt was a bitter day for the old clerks when harmoniums and organs came\r\ninto fashion, and the old orchestras conducted by them were abandoned.\r\nDethroned monarchs could not feel more distressed.\r\n\r\nThe period of the decline and fall of the status of the old parish\r\nclerks was that of the Commonwealth, from 1640 to 1660. During the\r\nspacious days of Elizabeth and the early Stuarts they were considered\r\nmost important officials. In pre-Reformation times the incumbents used\r\nto receive assistance from the chantry priests who were required to help\r\nthe parson when not engaged in their particular duties. After the\r\nsuppression of the chantries they continued their good offices and acted\r\nas assistant curates. But the race soon died out. Then lecturers and\r\nspecial preachers were frequently appointed by corporations or rich\r\nprivate individuals. But these lecturers and preachers were a somewhat\r\nindependent race who were not very loyal to the parsons and impatient of\r\nepiscopal control, and proved themselves rather a hindrance than a help.\r\nIn North Devon[39] and doubtless in many other places the experiment was\r\ntried of making use of the parish clerks and raising them to the\r\ndiaconate. Such a clerk so raised to major orders was Robert Langdon\r\n(1584-1625), of Barnstaple, to whose history I shall have occasion to\r\nrefer again. His successor, Anthony Baker, was also a clerk-deacon. The\r\nparish clerk then attained the zenith of his power, dignity, and\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: _The Parish Clerks of Barnstaple_, 1500-1900, by Rev. J.F.\r\nChanter (Transactions of the Devonshire Association).]\r\n\r\nAfter the disastrous period of the Commonwealth rule he emerges shorn\r\nof his learning, his rank, and status. His name remained; his office was\r\nrecognised by legal enactments and ecclesiastical usage; but in most\r\nparishes he was chosen on account of his poverty rather than for his\r\nfitness for the post. So long as the church rates remained he received\r\nhis salary, but when these were abolished it was found difficult in many\r\nparishes to provide the funds. Hence as the old race died out, the\r\noffice was allowed to lapse, and the old clerk's place knows him no\r\nmore. Possibly it may be the delectable task of some future historian to\r\nrecord the complete revival of the office, which would prove under\r\nproper conditions an immense advantage to the Church and a valuable\r\nassistance to the parochial clergy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE CLERK IN LITERATURE\r\n\r\nThe parish clerk is so notable a character in our ecclesiastical and\r\nsocial life, that he has not escaped the attention of many of our great\r\nwriters and poets. Some of them have with gentle satire touched upon his\r\nidiosyncrasies and peculiarities; others have recorded his many virtues,\r\nhis zeal and faithfulness. Shakespeare alludes to him in his play of\r\n_Richard II_, in the fourth act, when he makes the monarch face his\r\nrebellious nobles, reproaching them for their faithlessness, and saying:\r\n\r\n     \"God save the King! will no man say Amen?\r\n     Am I both priest and clerk? Well then, Amen.\r\n     God save the King! although I be not he;\r\n     And yet, Amen, if Heaven do think him me.\"\r\n\r\nAn old ballad, _King Cophetua and the Beggar-Maid_, contains an\r\ninteresting allusion to the parish clerk, and shows the truth of that\r\nwhich has already been pointed out, viz. that the office of clerk was\r\noften considered to be a step to higher preferment in the Church. The\r\nlines of the old ballad run as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The proverb old is come to passe,\r\n     The priest when he begins his masse\r\n     Forgets that ever clarke he was;\r\n       He knoweth not his estate.\"\r\n\r\nChristopher Harvey, the friend and imitator of George Herbert, has some\r\nhomely lines on the duties of clerk and sexton in his poem _The\r\nSynagogue_. Of the clerk he wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"The Churches Bible-clerk attends\r\n       Her utensils, and ends\r\n       Her prayers with Amen,\r\n     Tunes Psalms, and to her Sacraments\r\n       Brings in the Elements,\r\n       And takes them out again;\r\n     Is humble minded and industrious handed,\r\n     Doth nothing of himself, but as commanded.\"\r\n\r\nOf the sexton he wrote:\r\n\r\n      \"The Churches key-keeper opens the door,\r\n       And shuts it, sweeps the floor,\r\n     Rings bells, digs graves, and fills them up again;\r\n       All emblems unto men,\r\n       Openly owning Christianity\r\n       To mark and learn many good lessons by.\"\r\n\r\nIn that delightful sketch of old-time manners and quaint humour, _Sir\r\nRoger de Coverley_, the editor of _The Spectator_ gave a life-like\r\nrepresentation of the old-fashioned service. Nor is the clerk forgotten.\r\nThey tell us that \"Sir Roger has likewise added five pounds a year to\r\nthe clerk's place; and that he may encourage the young fellows to make\r\nthemselves perfect in the Church services, has promised, upon the death\r\nof the present incumbent, who is very old, to bestow it according to\r\nmerit.\" The details of the exquisite picture of a rural Sunday were\r\nprobably taken from the church of Milston on the Wiltshire downs where\r\nAddison's father was incumbent, and where the author was born in 1672.\r\nDoubtless the recollections of his early home enabled Joseph Addison to\r\ndraw such an accurate picture of the ecclesiastical customs of his\r\nyouth. The deference shown by the members of the congregation who did\r\nnot presume to stir till Sir Roger had left the building was practised\r\nin much more recent times, and instances will be given of the\r\nobservance of this custom within living memory.\r\n\r\nTwo other references to parish clerks I find in _The Spectator_ which\r\nare worthy of quotation:\r\n\r\n     \"_Spectator_, No. 372.\r\n\r\n     \"In three or four taverns I have, at different times, taken\r\n     notice of a precise set of people with grave countenances,\r\n     short wigs, black cloaths, or dark camblet trimmed black,\r\n     with mourning gloves and hat-bands, who went on certain days\r\n     at each tavern successively, and keep a sort of moving club.\r\n     Having often met with their faces, and observed a certain\r\n     shrinking way in their dropping in one after another, I had\r\n     the unique curiosity to inquire into their characters, being\r\n     the rather moved to it by their agreeing in the singularity\r\n     of their dress; and I find upon due examination they are a\r\n     knot of parish clerks, who have taken a fancy to one another,\r\n     and perhaps settle the bills of mortality over their half\r\n     pints. I have so great a value and veneration for any who\r\n     have but even an assenting _Amen_ in the service of religion,\r\n     that I am afraid but these persons should incur some scandal\r\n     by this practice; and would therefore have them, without\r\n     raillery, advise to send the florence and pullets home to\r\n     their own homes, and not to pretend to live as well as the\r\n     overseers of the poor.\r\n\r\n     \"HUMPHRY TRANSFER.\r\n\r\n     \"_Spectator_, No. 338.\r\n\r\n     \"A great many of our church-musicians being related to the\r\n     theatre, have in imitation of their epilogues introduced in\r\n     their favourite voluntaries a sort of music quite foreign to\r\n     the design of church services, to the great prejudice of\r\n     well-disposed people. These fingering gentlemen should be\r\n     informed that they ought to suit their airs to the place and\r\n     business; and that the musician is obliged to keep to the\r\n     text as much as the preacher. For want of this, I have found\r\n     by experience a great deal of mischief; for when the preacher\r\n     has often, with great piety and art enough, handled his\r\n     subject, and the judicious clerk has with utmost diligence\r\n     called out two staves proper to the discourse, and I have\r\n     found in myself and in the rest of the pew good thoughts and\r\n     dispositions, they have been all in a moment dissipated by a\r\n     merry jig from the organ loft.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson's definition of a parish clerk in his Dictionary does not\r\nconvey the whole truth about him and his historic office. He is defined\r\nas \"the layman who reads the responses to the congregation in church, to\r\ndirect the rest.\" The great lexicographer had, however, a high\r\nestimation of this official. Boswell tells us that on one occasion \"the\r\nRev. Mr. Palmer, Fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge, dined with us. He\r\nexpressed a wish that a better provision were made for parish clerks.\r\nJohnson: 'Yes, sir, a parish clerk should be a man who is able to make a\r\nwill or write a letter for anybody in the parish.'\" I am afraid that a\r\nvast number of our good clerks would have been sore puzzled to perform\r\nthe first task, and the caligraphy of the letter would in many cases\r\nhave been curious.\r\n\r\nThat careful delineator of rural manners as they existed at the end of\r\nthe eighteenth century, George Crabbe, devotes a whole poem to the\r\nparish clerk in his nineteenth letter of _The Borough_. He tells of the\r\nfortunes of Jachin, the clerk, a grave and austere man, fully orthodox,\r\na Pharisee of the Pharisees, and detecter and opposer of the wiles of\r\nSatan. Here is his picture:\r\n\r\n     \"With our late vicar, and his age the same,\r\n     His clerk, bright Jachin, to his office came;\r\n     The like slow speech was his, the like tall slender frame:\r\n     But Jachin was the gravest man on ground,\r\n     And heard his master's jokes with look profound;\r\n     For worldly wealth this man of letters sigh'd,\r\n     And had a sprinkling of the spirit's pride:\r\n     But he was sober, chaste, devout, and just,\r\n     One whom his neighbours could believe and trust:\r\n     Of none suspected, neither man nor maid\r\n     By him were wronged, or were of him afraid.\r\n       There was indeed a frown, a trick of state\r\n     In Jachin: formal was his air and gait:\r\n     But if he seemed more solemn and less kind\r\n     Than some light man to light affairs confined,\r\n     Still 'twas allow'd that he should so behave\r\n     As in high seat, and be severely grave.\"\r\n\r\nThe arch-tempter tries in vain to seduce him from the right path. \"The\r\nhouse where swings the tempting sign,\" the smiles of damsels, have no\r\npower over him. He \"shuns a flowing bowl and rosy lip,\" but he is not\r\ninvulnerable after all. Want and avarice take possession of his soul. He\r\nbegins to take by stealth the money collected in church, putting bran in\r\nhis pockets so that the coin shall not jingle. He offends with terror,\r\nrepeats his offence, grows familiar with crime, and is at last detected\r\nby a \"stern stout churl, an angry overseer.\" Disgrace, ruin, death soon\r\nfollow; shunned and despised by all, he \"turns to the wall and silently\r\nexpired.\" A woeful story truly, the results of spiritual pride and greed\r\nof gain! It is to be hoped that few clerks resembled poor lost Jachin.\r\n\r\nA companion picture to the disgraced clerk is that of \"the noble peasant\r\nIsaac Ashford[40],\" who won from Crabbe's pen a gracious panegyric. He\r\nsays of him:\r\n\r\n     \"Noble he was, contemning all things mean,\r\n     His truth unquestioned, and his soul serene.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     If pride were his, 'twas not their vulgar pride,\r\n     Who, in their base contempt, the great deride:\r\n     Nor pride in learning--though by Clerk agreed,\r\n     If fate should call him, Ashford might succeed.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: _The Parish Register_, Part III.]\r\n\r\nHe paints yet another portrait, that of old Dibble[41], clerk and\r\nsexton:\r\n\r\n     \"His eightieth year he reach'd still undecayed,\r\n     And rectors five to one close vault conveyed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     His masters lost, he'd oft in turn deplore,\r\n     And kindly add,--'Heaven grant I lose no more!'\r\n     Yet while he spake, a sly and pleasant glance\r\n     Appear'd at variance with his complaisance:\r\n     For as he told their fate and varying worth,\r\n     He archly looked--'I yet may bear thee forth.'\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: _The Parish Register_, Part III.]\r\n\r\nGeorge Herbert, the saintly Christian poet, who sang on earth such hymns\r\nand anthems as the angels sing in heaven, was no friend of the\r\nold-fashioned duet between the minister and clerk in the conduct of\r\ndivine service. He would have no \"talking, or sleeping, or gazing, or\r\nleaning, or half-kneeling, or any undutiful behaviour in them.\"\r\nMoreover, \"everyone, man and child, should answer aloud both Amen and\r\nall other answers which are on the clerk's and people's part to answer,\r\nwhich answers also are to be done not in a huddling or slubbering\r\nfashion, gaping, or scratching the head, or spitting even in the midst\r\nof their answer, but gently and pausably, thinking what they say, so\r\nthat while they answer 'As it was in the beginning, etc.,' they meditate\r\nas they speak, that God hath ever had his people that have glorified\r\nHim as well as now, and that He shall have so for ever. And the like in\r\nother answers.\"\r\n\r\nCowper's kindliness of heart is abundantly evinced by his treatment of a\r\nparish clerk, one John Cox, the official of the parish of All Saints,\r\nNorthampton. The poet was living in the little Buckinghamshire village\r\nof Weston Underwood, having left Olney when mouldering walls and a\r\ntottering house warned him to depart. He was recovering from his dread\r\nmalady, and beginning to feel the pleasures and inconveniences of\r\nauthorship and fame. The most amusing proof of his celebrity and his\r\ngood nature is thus related to Lady Hesketh:\r\n\r\n\"On Monday morning last, Sam brought me word that there was a man in the\r\nkitchen who desired to speak with me. I ordered him in. A plain, decent,\r\nelderly figure made its appearance, and being desired to sit spoke as\r\nfollows: 'Sir, I am clerk of the parish of All Saints in Northampton,\r\nbrother of Mr. Cox the upholsterer. It is customary for the person in my\r\noffice to annex to a bill of mortality, which he publishes at Christmas,\r\na copy of verses. You will do me a great favour, sir, if you will\r\nfurnish me with one.' To this I replied: 'Mr. Cox, you have several men\r\nof genius in your town, why have you not applied to some of them? There\r\nis a namesake of yours in particular, Cox, the Statuary, who, everybody\r\nknows, is a first-rate maker of verses. He surely is the man of all the\r\nworld for your purpose.' 'Alas, sir, I have heretofore borrowed help\r\nfrom him, but he is a gentleman of so much reading that the people of\r\nour town cannot understand him.'\r\n\r\n\"I confess to you, my dear, I felt all the force of the compliment\r\nimplied in this speech, and was almost ready to answer, Perhaps, my\r\ngood friend, they may find me unintelligible too for the same reason.\r\nBut on asking him whether he had walked over to Weston on purpose to\r\nimplore the assistance of my muse, and on his replying in the\r\naffirmative, I felt my mortified vanity a little consoled, and pitying\r\nthe poor man's distress, which appeared to be considerable, promised to\r\nsupply him. The waggon has accordingly gone this day to Northampton\r\nloaded in part with my effusions in the mortuary style. A fig for poets\r\nwho write epitaphs upon individuals! I have written _one_ that serves\r\n_two hundred_ persons.\"\r\n\r\nSeven successive years did Cowper, in his excellent good nature, supply\r\nJohn Cox, the clerk of All Saints in Northampton, with his mortuary\r\nverses[42], and when Cox died, he bestowed a like kindness on his\r\nsuccessor, Samuel Wright.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: Southey's _Works of Cowper_, ii. p. 283.]\r\n\r\nThese stanzas are published in the complete editions of Cowper's poems,\r\nand need not be quoted here. They begin with a quotation from some Latin\r\nauthor--Horace, or Virgil, or Cicero--these quotations being obligingly\r\ntranslated for the benefit of the worthy townsfolk. The first of these\r\nstanzas begins with the well-known lines:\r\n\r\n     \"While thirteen moons saw smoothly run\r\n       The Nen's barge-laden wave,\r\n     All these, life's rambling journey done,\r\n       Have found their home, the grave.\"\r\n\r\nAnother verse which has attained fame runs thus:\r\n\r\n     \"Like crowded forest trees we stand,\r\n       And some are mark'd to fall;\r\n     The axe will smite at God's command,\r\n       And soon will smite us all.\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus does Cowper, in his temporary rôle, point the moral:\r\n\r\n     \"And O! that humble as my lot,\r\n       And scorned as is my strain,\r\n     These truths, though known, too much forgot,\r\n       I may not teach in vain.\r\n\r\n     \"So prays your clerk with all his heart,\r\n       And, ere he quits his pen,\r\n     Begs you for once to take his part,\r\n       And answer all--Amen.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in another copy of verses he alludes to his honourable clerkship,\r\nand sings:\r\n\r\n     \"So your verse-man I, and clerk,\r\n       Yearly in my song proclaim\r\n     Death at hand--yourselves his mark--\r\n       And the foe's unerring aim.\r\n\r\n     \"Duly at my time I come,\r\n       Publishing to all aloud\r\n     Soon the grave must be our home,\r\n       And your only suit a shroud.\"\r\n\r\nOn one occasion the clerk delayed to send a printed copy of the verses;\r\nso we find the poet writing to his friend, William Bagot:\r\n\r\n\"You would long since have received an answer to your last, had not the\r\nwicked clerk of Northampton delayed to send me the printed copy of my\r\nannual dirge, which I waited to enclose. Here it is at last, and much\r\ngood may it do the readers!\"\r\n\r\nLet us hope that at least the clerk was grateful.\r\n\r\nYet again does the poet allude to the occupant of the lowest tier of the\r\ngreat \"three-decker,\" when he in the opening lines of _The Sofa_ depicts\r\nthe various seekers after sleep. After telling of the snoring nurse, the\r\nsleeping traveller in the coach, he continues:\r\n\r\n     \"Sweet sleep enjoys the curate in his desk,\r\n     The tedious rector drawling o'er his head;\r\n     And sweet the clerk below--\"\r\n\r\na pretty picture truly of a stirring and impressive service!\r\n\r\nCowper, if he were alive now, would have been no admirer of _Who's Who_,\r\nand poured scorn upon any\r\n\r\n     \"Fond attempt to give a deathless lot\r\n     To names ignoble, born to be forgot.\"\r\n\r\nBeholding some \"names of little note\" in the _Biographia Britannica_, he\r\nproceeded to satirise the publication, to laugh at the imaginary\r\nprocession of worthies--the squire, his lady, the vicar, and other local\r\ncelebrities, and chants in his anger:\r\n\r\n     \"There goes the parson, oh! illustrious spark!\r\n     And there, scarce less illustrious, goes the clerk.\"\r\n\r\nThe poet Gay is not unmindful of the\r\n\r\n     \"Parish clerk who calls the hymns so clear\";\r\n\r\nand Tennyson, in his sonnet to J.M.K., wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"Our dusty velvets have much need of thee:\r\n     Thou art no sabbath-drawler of old saws,\r\n     Distill'd from some worm-canker'd homily;\r\n     But spurr'd at heart with fiercest energy\r\n     To embattail and to wall about thy cause\r\n     With iron-worded proof, hating to hark\r\n     The humming of the drowsy pulpit-drone\r\n     Half God's good Sabbath, while the worn-out clerk\r\n     Brow-beats his desk below.\"\r\n\r\nIn the gallery of Dickens's characters stands out the immortal Solomon\r\nDaisy of _Barnaby Rudge_, with his \"cricket-like chirrup\" as he took his\r\npart in the social gossip round the Maypole fire. Readers of Dickens\r\nwill remember the timid Solomon's visit to the church at midnight when\r\nhe went to toll the passing bell, and his account of the strange things\r\nthat befell him there, and of the ringing of the mysterious bell that\r\ntold the murder of Reuben Haredale.\r\n\r\nIn the British Museum I discovered a fragmentary collection of ballads\r\nand songs, made by Mr. Ballard, and amongst these is a song relating to\r\na very unworthy follower of St. Nicholas, whose memory is thus unhappily\r\npreserved:\r\n\r\n     THE PARISH CLERK\r\n\r\n     A NEW COMIC SONG\r\n\r\n     _Tune_--THE VICAR AND MOSES\r\n\r\n     Here rests from his labours, by consent of his neighbours,\r\n       A peevish, ill-natur'd old clerk;\r\n     Who never design'd any good to mankind,\r\n       For of goodness he ne'er had a spark.\r\n         Tol lol de rol lol de rol lol.\r\n\r\n     But greedy as Death, until his last breath,\r\n       His method he ne'er failed to use;\r\n     When interr'd a corpse lay, Amen he'd scarce say,\r\n       Before he cry'd Who pays the dues?\r\n\r\n     Not a tear now he's dead, by friend or foe shed;\r\n       The first they were few, if he'd any;\r\n     Of the last he had more, than tongue can count o'er,\r\n       Who'd have hang'd the old churl for a penny.\r\n\r\n     In Levi's black train, the clerk did remain\r\n       Twenty years, squalling o'er a dull stave;\r\n     Yet his mind was so evil, he'd swear like the devil,\r\n       Nor repented on this side the grave.\r\n\r\n         _Fowler, Printer, Salisbury_.\r\n\r\nThat extraordinary man Mr. William Hutton, who died in 1813, and whose\r\nlife has been written and his works edited by Mr. Llewellyn Jewitt,\r\nF.S.A., amongst his other poems wrote a set of verses on _The Way to\r\nFind Sunday without an Almanack_. It tells the story of a Welsh\r\nclergyman who kept poultry, and how he told the days of the week and\r\nmarked the Sundays by the regularity with which one of his hens laid her\r\neggs. The seventh egg always became his Sunday letter, and thus he\r\nalways remembered to sally forth \"with gown and cassock, book and\r\nband,\" and perform his accustomed duty. Unfortunately the clerk was\r\ntreacherous, and one week stole an egg, with dire consequences to the\r\ncongregation, which had to wait until the clergyman, who was engaged in\r\nthe unclerical task of \"soleing shoes,\" could be fetched. The poem is a\r\npoor trifle, but it is perhaps worth mentioning on account of the\r\npersonality of the writer.\r\n\r\nThere is a charming sketch of an old clerk in the _Essays and Tales_ of\r\nthe late Lady Verney. The story tells of the old clerk's affection for\r\nhis great-grandchild, Benny. He is a delightfully drawn specimen of his\r\nrace. We see him \"creeping slowly about the shadows of the aisle, in his\r\nlong blue Sunday coat with huge brass buttons, the tails of which\r\nreached almost to his heels, shorts and brown leggings, and a\r\nlow-crowned hat in his hand. He was nearly eighty, but wiry still,\r\nrather blind and somewhat deaf; but the post of clerk is one considered\r\nto be quite independent and irremovable, _quam diu se bene gesserit_,\r\nduring good behaviour--on a level with Her Majesty's judges for that\r\nmatter. Having been raised to this great eminence some sixty years\r\nbefore, when he was the only man in the parish who could read, he would\r\nhave stood out for his rights to remain there as long as he pleased\r\nagainst all the powers and principalities in the kingdom--if, indeed, he\r\ncould have conceived the possibility of any one, in or out of the\r\nparish, being sufficiently irreligious and revolutionary to dispute his\r\nsovereignty. He was part of the church, and the church was part of\r\nhim--his rights and hers were indissolubly connected in his mind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The Psalms that day offered a fine field for his Anglo-Saxon plurals\r\nand south-country terminations; the 'housen,' 'priestesses,' 'beasteses\r\nof the field,' came rolling freely forth from his mouth, upon which no\r\nremonstrances by the curate had had the smallest effect. Was he, Michael\r\nMajor, who had fulfilled the important office 'afore that young\r\njackanapes was born, to be teached how 'twere to be done?' he had\r\nobserved more than once in rather a high tone, though in general he\r\npatronised the successive occupants of the pulpit with much kindness.\r\n'And this 'un, as cannot spike English nayther,' he added superciliously\r\nconcerning the north-country accent of his pastor and master.\"\r\n\r\nOn weekdays he wore a smock-frock, which he called his surplice, with\r\nwonderful fancy stitches on the breast and back and sleeves. At length\r\nhe had to resign his post and take to his bed, and was not afraid to die\r\nwhen his time came. It is a very tender and touching little story, a\r\nvery faithful picture of an old clerk[43].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: _Essays and Tales_, by Frances Parthenope Lady Verney, p.\r\n67.]\r\n\r\nPassing from grave to gay, we find Tom Hood sketching the clerk\r\nattending on his vicar, who is about to perform a wedding service and\r\nmake two people for ever happy. He christens the two officials \"the\r\njoiners, no rough mechanics, but a portly full-blown vicar with his\r\nclerk, both rubicund, a peony paged by a pink. It made me smile to\r\nobserve the droll clerical turn of the clerk's beaver, scrubbed into\r\nthat fashion by his coat at the nape.\"\r\n\r\nFew people know Alexander Pope's _Memoir of P.P., Clerk of this Parish_,\r\nwhich was intended to ridicule Burnet's _History of His Own Time_, a\r\nwork characterised by a strong tincture of self-importance and egotism.\r\nThese are abundantly exposed in the _Memoir_, which begins thus:\r\n\r\n\"In the name of the Lord, Amen. I, P.P., by the Grace of God, Clerk of\r\nthis Parish, writeth this history.\r\n\r\n\"Ever since I arrived at the age of discretion I had a call to take upon\r\nme the Function of a Parish Clerk, and to this end it seemed unto me\r\nmeet and profitable to associate myself with the parish clerks of this\r\nland, such I mean as were right worthy in their calling, men of a clear\r\nand sweet voice, and of becoming gravity.\"\r\n\r\nHe tells how on the day of his birth Squire Bret gave a bell to the ring\r\nof the parish. Hence that one and the same day did give to their own\r\nchurch two rare gifts, its great bell and its clerk.\r\n\r\nLeaving the account of P.P.'s youthful amours and bouts at\r\nquarter-staff, we next find that:\r\n\r\n\"No sooner was I elected into my office, but I layed aside the\r\ngallantries of my youth and became a new man. I considered myself as in\r\nsomewise of ecclesiastical dignity, since by wearing of a band, which is\r\nno small part of the ornaments of our clergy, might not unworthily be\r\ndeemed, as it were, a shred of the linen vestments of Aaron.\r\n\r\n\"Thou mayest conceive, O reader, with what concern I perceived the eyes\r\nof the congregation fixed upon me, when I first took my place at the\r\nfeet of the Priest. When I raised the Psalm, how did my voice quiver\r\nwith fear! And when I arrayed the shoulders of the minister with the\r\nsurplice, how did my joints tremble under me! I said within myself,\r\n'Remember, Paul, thou standest before men of high worship, the wise Mr.\r\nJustice Freeman, the grave Mr. Justice Tonson, the good Lady Jones.'\r\nNotwithstanding it was my good hap to acquit myself to the good liking\r\nof the whole congregation, but the Lord forbid I should glory therein.\"\r\n\r\nHe then proceeded to remove \"the manifold corruptions and abuses.\"\r\n\r\n1. \"I was especially severe in whipping forth dogs from the Temple, all\r\nexcept the lap-dog of the good widow Howard, a sober dog which yelped\r\nnot, nor was there offence in his mouth.\r\n\r\n2. \"I did even proceed to moroseness, though sore against my heart, unto\r\npoor babes, in tearing from them the half-eaten apple, which they\r\nprivily munched at church. But verily it pitied me, for I remembered the\r\ndays of my youth.\r\n\r\n3. \"With the sweat of my own hands I did make plain and smooth the dog's\r\nears throughout our Great Bible.\r\n\r\n4. \"I swept the pews, not before swept in the third year. I darned the\r\nsurplice and laid it in lavender.\"\r\n\r\nThe good clerk also made shoes, shaved and clipped hair, and practised\r\nchirurgery also in the worming of dogs.\r\n\r\n\"Now was the long expected time arrived when the Psalms of King David\r\nshould be hymned unto the same tunes to which he played them upon his\r\nharp, so I was informed by my singing-master, a man right cunning in\r\nPsalmody. Now was our over-abundant quaver and trilling done away, and\r\nin lieu thereof was instituted the sol-fa in such guise as is sung in\r\nhis Majesty's Chapel. We had London singing-masters sent into every\r\nparish like unto excisemen.\"\r\n\r\nP.P. was accused by his enemies of humming through his nostrils as a\r\nsackbut, yet he would not forgo the harmony, it having been agreed by\r\nthe worthy clerks of London still to preserve the same. He tutored the\r\nyoung men and maidens to tune their voices as it were a psaltery, and\r\nthe church on Sunday was filled with new Hallelujahs.\r\n\r\nBut the fame of the great is fleeting. Poor Paul Philips passed away,\r\nand was forgotten. When his biographer went to see him, his place knew\r\nhim no more. No one could tell of his virtues, his career, his\r\nexcellences. Nothing remained but his epitaph:\r\n\r\n     \"O reader, if that thou canst read,\r\n       Look down upon this stone;\r\n     Do all we can, Death is a man\r\n       That never spareth none.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nCLERKS TOO CLERICAL. SMUGGLING DAYS AND SMUGGLING WAYS\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps not altogether surprising that in times when ordained\r\nclergymen were scarce, and when much confusion reigned, the clerk should\r\noccasionally have taken upon himself to discharge duties which scarcely\r\npertained to his office. Great diversity of opinion is evident as\r\nregards the right of the clerk to perform certain ecclesiastical\r\nservices, such as his reading of the Burial Service, the Churching of\r\nWomen, and the reading of the daily services in the absence of the\r\nincumbent. In the days of Queen Elizabeth, judging from the numerous\r\ninquiries issued by the bishops at their visitations, one would imagine\r\nthat the parish clerk performed many services which pertained to the\r\nduties of the parish priest. It is not likely that such inquiries should\r\nhave been made if some reports of clerks and readers exceeding their\r\nprescribed functions had not reached episcopal ears. They ask if readers\r\npresume to baptize or marry or celebrate Holy Communion. And the answers\r\nreceived in several cases support the surmise of the bishops. Thus we\r\nread that at Westbere, \"When the parson is absent the parish clerk reads\r\nthe service.\" At Waltham the parish clerk served the parish for the most\r\nas the vicar seldom came there. At Tenterden the service was read by a\r\nlayman, one John Hopton, and at Fairfield a reader served the church.\r\nThis was the condition of those parishes in 1569, and doubtless many\r\nothers were similarly situated.\r\n\r\nThe Injunctions of Archbishop Grindal, issued in 1571, are severe and\r\noutspoken with regard to lay ministration. He wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"We do enjoin and straitly command, that from henceforth no\r\n     parish clerk, nor any other person not being ordered, at the\r\n     least, for a deacon, shall presume to solemnize Matrimony, or\r\n     to minister the Sacrament of Baptism, or to deliver the\r\n     communicants the Lord's cup at the celebration of the Holy\r\n     Communion. And that no person, not being a minister, deacon,\r\n     or at least, tolerated by the ordinary in writing, do attempt\r\n     to supply the office of a minister in saying divine service\r\n     openly in any church or chapel.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Lincoln diocese in 1588 the clerk was still allowed to read one\r\nlesson and the epistle, but he was forbidden from saying the service,\r\nministering any sacraments or reading any homily. In some cases greater\r\nfreedom was allowed. In the beautiful Lady Chapel of the Church of St.\r\nMary Overy there is preserved a curious record relating to this:\r\n\r\n     \"Touching the Parish Clerk and Sexton all is well; only our\r\n     clerk doth sometimes to ease the minister read prayers,\r\n     church women, christen, bury and marry, being allowed so\r\n     to do.\r\n\r\n     \"December 9. 1634.\"\r\n\r\nBishop Joseph Hall of Exeter asked in 1638 in his visitation articles,\r\n\"Whether in the absence of the minister or at any other time the Parish\r\nClerk, or any other lay person, said Common Prayer openly in the church\r\nor any part of the Divine Service which is proper to the Priest?\"\r\n\r\nArchdeacon Marsh, of Chichester, in 1640 inquires: \"Hath your Parish\r\nClerk or Sexton taken upon him to meddle with anything above his office,\r\nas churching of women, burying of the dead, or such like?\"\r\n\r\nDuring the troublous times of the Commonwealth period it is not\r\nsurprising that the clerk often performed functions which were \"above\r\nhis office,\" when clergymen were banished from their livings. We have\r\nnoticed already an example of the burial service being performed by the\r\nclerk when he was so rudely treated by angry Parliamentarians for using\r\nthe Book of Common Prayer. Here is an instance of the ceremony of\r\nmarriage being performed by the parish clerk:\r\n\r\n     \"The marriages in the Parish of Dale Abbey were till a few\r\n     years previous to the Marriage Act, solemnized by the Clerk\r\n     of the Parish, at one shilling each, there being no\r\n     minister.\"\r\n\r\nThis Marriage Act was that passed by the Little Parliament of 1653, by\r\nwhich marriage was pronounced to be merely a civil contract. Banns were\r\npublished in the market-place, and the marriages were performed by\r\nCromwell's Justices of the Peace whom, according to a Yorkshire vicar,\r\n\"that impious and rebell appointed out of the basest Hypocrites and\r\ndissemblers with God and man.\" The clerks' marriage ceremony was no\r\nworse than that of the justices.\r\n\r\nDr. Macray, of the Bodleian Library, has discovered the draft of a\r\nlicence granted by Dr. John Mountain, Bishop of London, to Thomas\r\nDickenson, parish clerk of Waltham Holy Cross, in the year 1621,\r\npermitting him to read prayers, church women, and bury the dead. This\r\nlicence states that the parish of Waltham Holy Cross was very spacious,\r\nmany houses being a long distance from the church, and that the curate\r\nwas very much occupied with his various duties of visiting the sick,\r\nburying the dead, churching women, and other business belonging to his\r\noffice; hence permission is granted to Thomas Dickenson to assist the\r\ncurate in reading prayers in church, burying dead corpses, and to church\r\nwomen in the absence of the curate, or when the curate cannot\r\nconveniently perform the same duty in his own person.\r\n\r\nDoubtless this licence was no solitary exception, and it is fairly\r\ncertain that other clerks enjoyed the same privileges which are here\r\nassigned to Master Thomas Dickenson. He must have been a worthy member\r\nof his class, a man of education, and of skill and ability in reading,\r\nor episcopal sanction would not have been given to him to perform these\r\nimportant duties.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that parish clerks occasionally at least performed several\r\nimportant clerical functions with the consent of, or in the absence of\r\nthe incumbents, and that in spite of the articles in the visitations of\r\nsome bishops who were opposed to this practice, episcopal sanction was\r\nnot altogether wanting.\r\n\r\nThe affection with which the parishioners regarded the clerk is\r\nevidenced in many ways. He received from them many gifts in kind and\r\nmoney, such as eggs and cakes and sheaves of corn. Some of them were\r\ndemanded in early times as a right that could not be evaded; but the\r\ncompulsory payment of such goods was abolished, and the parishioners\r\nwillingly gave by courtesy that which had been deemed a right.\r\n\r\nSometimes land has been left to the clerk in order that he may ring the\r\ncurfew-bell, or a bell at night and early morning, so that travellers\r\nmay be warned lest they should lose their way over wild moorland or\r\nbleak down, and, guided by the sound of the bell, may reach a place\r\nof safety.\r\n\r\nAn old lady once lost her way on the Lincolnshire wolds, nigh Boston,\r\nbut was guided to her home by the sound of the church bell tolling at\r\nnight. So grateful was she that she bequeathed a piece of land to the\r\nparish clerk on condition that he should ring one of the bells from\r\nseven to eight o'clock each evening during the winter months.\r\n\r\nThere is a piece of land called \"Curfew Land\" at St.\r\nMargaret's-at-Cliffe, Kent, the rent of which was directed to be paid to\r\nthe clerk or other person who should ring the curfew every evening in\r\norder to warn travellers lest they should fall over the cliff, as the\r\nunfortunate donor of the land did, for want of the due and constant\r\nringing of the bell.\r\n\r\nIn smuggling days, clerks, like many of their betters, were not\r\nimmaculate. The venerable vicar of Worthing, the Rev. E. K. Elliott,\r\nrecords that the clerk of Broadwater was himself a smuggler, and in\r\nleague with those who throve by the illicit trade. When a cargo was\r\nexpected he would go up to the top of the spire, which afforded a\r\nsplendid view of the sea, and when the coast was clear of preventive\r\nofficers he would give the signal by hoisting a flag. Kegs of contraband\r\nspirits were frequently placed inside two huge tombs which have sliding\r\ntops, and which stand near the western porch of Worthing church.\r\n\r\nThe last run of smuggled goods in that neighbourhood was well within the\r\nrecollection of the vicar, and took place in 1855. Some kegs were taken\r\nto Charman Dean and buried in the ground, and although diligent search\r\nwas made, the smugglers baffled their pursuers.\r\n\r\nAt Soberton, Hants, there is an old vault near the chancel door. Now the\r\nflat stone is level with the ground; but in 1800 it rested on three feet\r\nof brickwork, and could be lifted off by two men. Here many kegs of\r\nspirit that paid no duty were deposited by an arrangement with the\r\nclerk, and the stone lifted on again. This secret hiding-place was never\r\ndiscovered, neither did the curate find out who requisitioned his horse\r\nwhen the nights favoured smugglers.\r\n\r\nIn the wild days of Cornish wreckers and wrecking, both priest and clerk\r\nare said to have taken part in the sharing of the tribute of the sea\r\ncast upon their rockbound coast. The historian of Cornwall, Richard\r\nPolwhele, tells of a wreck happening one Sunday morning just before\r\nservice. The clerk, eager to be at the fray, announced to the assembled\r\nparishioners that \"Measter would gee them a holiday.\"\r\n\r\nI will not vouch for the truth of that other story told in the\r\n_Encyclopædia of Wit_ (1801), which runs as follows:\r\n\r\n\"A parson who lived on the coast of Cornwall, where one great business\r\nof the inhabitants is plundering from ships that are wrecked, being once\r\npreaching when the alarm was given, found that the sound of the wreck\r\nwas so much more attractive than his sermon, that all his congregation\r\nwere scampering out of church. To check their precipitation, he called\r\nout, 'My brethren, let me entreat you to stay for five words more'; and\r\nmarching out of the pulpit, till he had got pretty near the door of the\r\nchurch, slowly pronounced, 'Let us all start fair,' and ran off with the\r\nrest of them.\"\r\n\r\nAn old parishioner of the famous Rev. R. S. Hawker once told him of a\r\nvery successful run of a cargo of kegs, which the obliging parish clerk\r\nallowed the smugglers to place underneath the benches and in the tower\r\nstairs of the church. The old man told the story thus:\r\n\r\n     \"We bribed Tom Hockaday, the sexton, and we had the goods\r\n     safe in the seats by Saturday night. The parson did wonder at\r\n     the large congregation, for divers of them were not regular\r\n     churchgoers at other times; and if he had known what was\r\n     going on, he could not have preached a more suitable\r\n     discourse, for it was, 'Be not drunk with wine, wherein is\r\n     excess.' It was one of his best sermons; but, there, it did\r\n     not touch us, you see; for we never tasted anything but\r\n     brandy and gin.\"\r\n\r\nIn such smuggling ways the clerk was no worse than his neighbours, who\r\nwere all more or less involved in the illicit trade.\r\n\r\nThe old Cornish clerks who used to help the smugglers were a curious\r\nrace of beings, remarkable for their familiar ways with the parson. At\r\nSt. Clements the clergyman one day was reading the verse, \"I have seen\r\nthe ungodly flourish like a _green bay_ tree,\" when the clerk looked up\r\nwith an inquiring glance from the desk below, \"How can that be,\r\nmaister?\" He was more familiar with the colour of a bay horse than the\r\ntints of a bay tree.\r\n\r\nAt Kenwyn two dogs, one of which belonged to the parson, were fighting\r\nat the west end of the church; the parson, who was then reading the\r\nsecond lesson, rushed out of the pew and went down and parted them.\r\nReturning to his pew, and doubtful where he had left off, he asked the\r\nclerk, \"Roger, where was I?\" \"Why, down parting the dogs, maister,\"\r\nreplied Roger.\r\n\r\nTwo rocks stand out on the South Devon coast near Dawlish, which are\r\nknown as the Parson and Clerk. A wild, weird legend is told about these\r\nrocks--of a parson who desired the See of Exeter, and often rode with\r\nhis clerk to Dawlish to hear the latest news of the bishop who was nigh\r\nunto death. The wanderers lost their way one dark night, and the parson\r\nexhibited most unclerical anger, telling his clerk that he would rather\r\nhave the devil for a guide than him. Of course, the devil or one of his\r\nimps obliged, and conducted the wanderers to an old ruined house, where\r\nthere was a large company of disguised demons. They all passed a merry\r\nnight, singing and carousing. Then the news comes that the bishop is\r\ndead. The parson and clerk determine to set out at once. Their steeds\r\nare brought, but will not budge a step. The parson cuts savagely at his\r\nhorse. The demons roar with unearthly laughter. The ruined house and all\r\nthe devils vanish. The waves are overwhelming the riders, and in the\r\nmorning the wretches are found clinging to the rocks with the grasp of\r\ndeath, which ever afterwards record their villainy and their fate.\r\n\r\nAmong tales of awe and weird mystery stands out the story of the\r\nadventures of Peter Priestly, clerk, sexton, and gravestone cutter, of\r\nWakefield, who flourished at the end of the eighteenth century. He was\r\nan old and much respected inhabitant of the town, and not at all given\r\nto superstitious fears. One Saturday evening he went to the church to\r\nfinish the epitaph on a stone which was to be in readiness for removal\r\nbefore Sunday. Arrived at the church, where he had his workshop, he set\r\ndown his lantern and lighted his other candle, which was set in a\r\nprimitive candlestick formed out of a potato. The church clock struck\r\neleven, and still some letters remained unfinished, when he heard a\r\nstrange sound, which seemed to say \"Hiss!\" \"Hush!\" He resumes his work\r\nundaunted. Again that awful voice breaks in once more. He lights his\r\nlantern and searches for its cause. In vain his efforts. He resolves to\r\nleave the church, but again remembers his promise and returns to his\r\nwork. The mystic hour of midnight strikes. He has nearly finished, and\r\nbends down to examine the letters on the stone. Again he hears a louder\r\n\"Hiss!\" He now stands appalled. Terror seizes him. He has profaned the\r\nSabbath, and the sentence of death has gone forth. With tottering steps\r\nPeter finds his way home and goes to bed. Sleep forsakes him. His wife\r\nministers to him in vain. As morning dawns the good woman notices\r\nPeter's wig suspended on the great chair. \"Oh, Peter,\" she cries, \"what\r\nhast thou been doing to burn all t' hair off one side of thy wig?\" \"Ah!\r\nbless thee,\" says the clerk, \"thou hast cured me with that word.\" The\r\nmysterious \"hiss\" and \"hush\" were sounds from the frizzling of Peter's\r\nwig by the flame of the candle, which to his imperfect sense of hearing\r\nimported things horrible and awful. Such is the story which a writer in\r\nHone's _Year Book_ tells, and which is said to have afforded Peter\r\nPriestly and the good people of merry Wakefield many a joke.\r\n\r\nThe _Year Book_ is always full of interest, and in the same volume I\r\nfind an account of a most worthy representative of the profession, one\r\nJohn Kent, the parish clerk of St. Albans, who died in 1798, aged eighty\r\nyears. He was a very venerable and intelligent man, who did service in\r\nthe old abbey church, long before the days when its beauties were\r\ndesecrated by Grimthorpian restoration, or when it was exalted to\r\ncathedral rank. For fifty-two years Kent was the zealous clerk and\r\ncustodian of the minster, and loved to describe its attractions. He was\r\nthe friend of the learned Browne Willis. His name is mentioned in\r\nCough's _Sepulchral Monuments of Great Britain_, and his intelligence\r\nand knowledge noticed, and Newcombe, the historian of the abbey,\r\nexpressed his gratitude to the good clerk for much information imparted\r\nby him to the author. The monks could not have guarded the shrine of St.\r\nAlban with greater care than did Kent protect the relics of good Duke\r\nHumphrey. His veneration for all that the abbey contained was\r\nremarkable. A story is told of a gentleman who purloined a bone of the\r\nDuke. The clerk suspected the theft but could never prove it, though he\r\nsometimes taxed the gentleman with having removed the bone. At last,\r\njust before his death, the man restored it, saying to the clerk, \"I\r\ncould not depart easy with it in my possession.\"\r\n\r\nKent was a plumber and glazier by trade, in politics a staunch partisan\r\nof \"the Blues,\" and on account of his sturdy independence was styled\r\n\"Honest John.\" He performed his duties in the minster with much zeal and\r\nability, his knowledge of psalmody was unsurpassed, his voice was strong\r\nand melodious, and he was a complete master of church music. Unlike many\r\nof his confrères, he liked to hear the congregation sing; but when\r\ncountry choirs came from neighbouring churches to perform in the abbey\r\nwith instruments, contemptuously described by him as \"a box of\r\nwhistles,\" the congregation being unable to join in the melodies, he\r\nused to give out the anthem thus: \"Sing _ye_ to the praise and glory of\r\nGod....\" Five years before his death he had an attack of paralysis which\r\nslightly crippled his power of utterance, though this defect could\r\nscarcely be detected when he was engaged in the services of the church.\r\nTwo days before his death he sang his \"swan-song.\" Some colours were\r\npresented to the volunteers of the town, and were consecrated in the\r\nabbey. During the service he sang the 20th Psalm with all the strength\r\nand vivacity of youth. When his funeral sermon was preached the rector\r\nalluded to this dying effort, and said that on the day of the great\r\nservice \"Nature seemed to have reassumed her throne; and, as she knew it\r\nwas to be his last effort, was determined it should be his best.\" The\r\nbody of the good clerk, John Kent, rests in the abbey church which he\r\nloved so well, in a spot marked by himself, and we hope that the\r\n\"restoration,\" somewhat drastic and severe, which has fallen upon the\r\ngrand old church, has not obscured his grave or destroyed the memorial\r\nof this worthy and excellent clerk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE CLERK IN EPITAPH\r\n\r\nThe virtues of many a parish clerk are recorded on numerous humble\r\ntombstones in village churchyards. The gratitude felt by both rector and\r\npeople for many years of faithful service is thus set forth, sometimes\r\ncouched in homely verse, and occasionally marred by the misplaced humour\r\nand jocular expressions and puns with which our forefathers thought fit\r\nto honour the dead. In this they were not original, and but followed the\r\nexample of the Greeks and Romans, the Italians, Spaniards, and French.\r\nThis objectionable fashion of punning on gravestones was formerly much\r\nin vogue in England, and such a prominent official as the clerk did not\r\nescape the attention of the punsters. Happily the quaint fancies and\r\nprimitive humour, which delighted our grandsires in the production of\r\nrebuses and such-like pleasantries, no longer find themselves displayed\r\nupon the fabric of our churches, and the \"merry jests\" have ceased to\r\nappear upon the memorials of the dead. We will glance at the clerkly\r\nepitaphs of some of the worthies who have held the office of parish\r\nclerk who were deemed deserving of a memorial.\r\n\r\nIn the southern portion of the churchyard attached to St. Andrew's\r\nChurch, Rugby, is a plain upright stone containing the following\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n          In memory of\r\n          Peter Collis\r\n        33 years Clerk of\r\n           this Parish\r\n     who died Feb'y 28th 1818\r\n         Aged 82 years\r\n\r\n[Some lines of poetry follow, but these unfortunately are not now\r\ndiscernible.]\r\n\r\nAt the time Peter held office the incumbent was noted for his\r\ncard-playing propensities, and the clerk was much addicted to\r\ncock-fighting. The following couplet relating to these worthies is still\r\nremembered:\r\n\r\n     No wonder the people of Rugby are all in the dark,\r\n     With a card-playing parson and a cock-fighting clerk.\r\n\r\nPeter's father was clerk before him, and on a stone to his memory is\r\nrecorded as follows:\r\n\r\n               In memory of\r\n          John Collis Husband of\r\n          Eliz: Collis who liv'd in\r\n          Wedlock together 50 years\r\n      he served as Parish Clerk 41 years\r\n     And died June 19th 1781 aged 69 years\r\n\r\n       Him who covered up the Dead\r\n       Is himself laid in the same bed\r\n       Time with his crooked scythe hath made\r\n       Him lay his mattock down and spade\r\n       May he and we all rise again\r\n       To everlasting life AMEN.\r\n\r\nThe name Collis occurs amongst those who held the office of parish clerk\r\nat West Haddon. The Rev. John T. Page, to whom I am indebted for the\r\nabove information[44], has gleaned the following particulars from the\r\nparish registers and other sources. The clerk who reigned in 1903 was\r\nThomas Adams, who filled the position for eighteen years. He succeeded\r\nhis father-in-law, William Prestidge, who died 24 March, 1886, after\r\nholding the office fifty-three years. His predecessor was Thomas Collis,\r\nwho died 30 January, 1833, after holding the office fifty-two years, and\r\nsucceeded John Colledge, who, according to an old weather-beaten stone\r\nstill standing in the churchyard, died 12 September, 1781. How long\r\nColledge held office cannot now be ascertained. Here are some remarkable\r\nexamples of long years of service, Collis and Prestidge having held the\r\noffice for 105 years.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: cf. _Notes and Queries_, Tenth Series, ii., 10 September,\r\n1904, p. 215.]\r\n\r\nIn Shenley churchyard the following remarkable epitaph appears to the\r\nmemory of Joseph Rogers, who was a bricklayer as well as parish clerk:\r\n\r\n     Silent in dust lies mouldering here\r\n     A Parish Clerk of voice most clear.\r\n     None Joseph Rogers could excel\r\n     In laying bricks or singing well;\r\n     Though snapp'd his line, laid by his rod,\r\n     We build for him our hopes in God.\r\n\r\nA remarkable instance of longevity is recorded on a tombstone in Cromer\r\nchurchyard. The inscription runs:\r\n\r\n     Sacred to the memory of David Vial who departed this life the\r\n     26th of March, 1873, aged 94 years, for sixty years clerk of\r\n     this parish.\r\n\r\nAt the village church of Whittington, near Oswestry, there is a\r\nwell-known epitaph, which is worth recording:\r\n\r\n     March 13th 1766 died Thomas Evans, Parish Clerk, aged 72.\r\n\r\n     Old Sternhold's lines or \"Vicar of Bray\"\r\n     Which he tuned best 'twas hard to say.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable instance of longevity is that recorded on a\r\ntombstone in the cemetery of Eye, Suffolk, erected to the memory of a\r\nfaithful clerk:\r\n\r\n     Erected to the memory of\r\n     George Herbert\r\n     who was clerk of this parish for more\r\n     than 71 years\r\n     and who died on the 17th May 1873\r\n     aged 81 years.\r\n\r\n     This monument\r\n     Is erected to his memory by his grateful\r\n     Friend\r\n     the Rev. W. Page Roberts\r\n     Vicar of Eye.\r\n\r\nHerbert must have commenced his duties very early in life; according to\r\nthe inscription, at the age of ten years.\r\n\r\nAt Scothorne, in Lincolnshire, there is a sexton-ringer-clerk epitaph on\r\nJohn Blackburn's tombstone, dated 1739-40. It reads thus:\r\n\r\n     Alas poor John\r\n     Is dead and gone\r\n     Who often toll'd the Bell\r\n     And with a spade\r\n     Dug many a grave\r\n     And said Amen as well.\r\n\r\nThe Roes were a great family of clerks at Bakewell, and the two members\r\nwho occupied that office at the end of the eighteenth and beginning of\r\nthe nineteenth century seem to have been endowed with good voices, and\r\nwith a devoted attachment to the church and its monuments. Samuel Roe\r\nhad the honour of being mentioned in the _Gentleman's Magazine_, and\r\nreceives well-deserved praise for his care of the fabric of Bakewell\r\nChurch, and his epitaph is given, which runs as follows:\r\n\r\n     To\r\n     The memory of\r\n     SAMUEL ROE\r\n     Clerk\r\n     of the Parish Church of Bakewell,\r\n     which office\r\n     he filled thirty-five years\r\n     with credit to himself\r\n     and satisfaction to the inhabitants.\r\n     His natural powers of voice,\r\n     in clearness, strength, and sweetness\r\n     were altogether unequalled.\r\n     He died October 31st, 1792\r\n     Aged 70 years\r\n\r\nThe correspondent of the _Gentleman's Magazine_ wrote thus of this\r\nfaithful clerk:\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Urban,\r\n\r\n     \"It was with much concern that I read the epitaph upon Mr.\r\n     Roe in your last volume, page 1192. Upon a little tour which\r\n     I made in Derbyshire in 1789, I met with that worthy and very\r\n     intelligent man at Bakewell, and in the course of my\r\n     antiquarian researches there, derived no inconsiderable\r\n     assistance from his zeal and civility. If he did not possess\r\n     the learning of his namesake, your old and valuable\r\n     correspondent[45], I will venture to declare that he was not\r\n     less influenced by a love and veneration for antiquity, many\r\n     proofs of which he had given by his care and attention to the\r\n     monuments of the church which were committed to his charge;\r\n     for he united the characters of sexton, clerk,\r\n     singing-master, will-maker, and schoolmaster. Finding that I\r\n     was quite alone, he requested permission to wait upon me at\r\n     the inn in the evening, urging as a reason for this request\r\n     that he must be exceedingly gratified by the conversation of\r\n     a gentleman who could read the characters upon the monument\r\n     of Vernon, the founder of Haddon House, a treat he had not\r\n     met with for many years. After a very pleasant gossip we\r\n     parted, but not till my honest friend had, after some\r\n     apparent struggle, begged of me to indulge him with my name.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: T. Row stands for T_he_ R_ector_ O_f_ W_hittington_, the\r\nRev. Samuel Pegge. cf. _Curious Epitaphs_, by W. Andrews, p. 124.]\r\n\r\nTo this worthy clerk's care is due the preservation of the Vernon and\r\nother monuments in Bakewell Church. Mr. Andrews tells us that \"in some\r\ninstances he placed a wooden framework to keep off the rough hands and\r\nrougher knives of the boys and young men of the congregation. He also\r\nwatched with special care the Wenderley tomb, and even took careful\r\nrubbings of the inscriptions[46].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: W. Andrews, _Curious Epitaphs_, p. 124.]\r\n\r\nThe inscription on the tomb of the son of this worthy clerk proves that\r\nhe inherited his father's talents as regards musical ability:\r\n\r\n     Erected\r\n     In remembrance of\r\n     PHILIP ROE\r\n     Who died 12th September, 1815,\r\n     Aged 52 years.\r\n\r\n     The vocal Powers here let us mark\r\n     Of Philip our late Parish Clerk,\r\n     In church none ever heard a Layman\r\n     With a clearer voice say 'Amen'!\r\n     Who now with Hallelujahs sound\r\n     Like him can make this roof rebound?\r\n     The Choir lament his Choral Tones\r\n     The Town--so soon Here lie his Bones.\r\n     Sleep undisturb'd within thy peaceful shrine\r\n     Till Angels wake thee with such notes as thine.\r\n\r\nThe last two lines are a sweet and tender tribute truly to the memory\r\nof this melodious clerk.\r\n\r\nA writer in _All the Year Round_[47], who has been identified as\r\nCuthbert Bede, the author of the immortal _Verdant Green_, tells of the\r\nOsbornes and Worrals, famous families of clerks, quoting instances of\r\nthe hereditary nature of the office. He wrote as follows\r\nconcerning them:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: No. 624, New Series, p. 83.]\r\n\r\n\"As a boy I often attended the service at Belbroughton Church,\r\nWorcestershire, when the clerk was Mr. Osborne, tailor. His family had\r\nbeen parish clerks and tailors since the time of Henry VIII, and were\r\nlineally descended from William Fitz-Osborne, who in the twelfth century\r\nhad been deprived by Ralph Fitz-Herbert of his right to the manor of\r\nBellam, in the parish of Bellroughton. Often have I stood in the\r\npicturesque churchyard of Wolverley, Worcestershire, by the grave of the\r\nold parish clerk, whom I well remember, old Thomas Worrall, the\r\ninscription on whose monument is as follows:\r\n\r\n          Sacred to the memory of\r\n          THOMAS WORRALL,\r\n          parish clerk of Wolverley for a period of\r\n          forty-seven years.\r\n          Died A.D. 1854, February 23rd.\r\n          He served with faithfulness in humble sphere\r\n          As one who could his talents well employ,\r\n          Hope that when Christ his Lord shall reappear,\r\n          He may be bidden to his Master's joy.\r\n\r\n     This tombstone was erected to the memory of the deceased\r\n     by a few parishioners in testimony of his worth, April 1855.\r\n\r\n          Charles R. Somers Cocks,\r\n               Vicar.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted of this worthy clerk that, with the exception of a week\r\nor two before his death, he was never absent from his Sunday and weekday\r\nduties in the forty-seven years during which he held office.\r\n\r\nHe succeeded his father, James Worrall, who died in 1806, aged\r\nseventy-nine, after being parish clerk of Wolverley for thirty years.\r\nHis tombstone, near to that of his son, was erected \"to record his worth\r\nboth in his public and private character, and as a mark of personal\r\nesteem--p. 1. F.H. and W.C. p.c.\" I am told that these initials stand\r\nfor F. Hustle, and the Rev. William Callow, and that the latter was the\r\nauthor of the following lines inscribed on the monument, which are well\r\nworth quoting:\r\n\r\n     If courtly bards adorn each statesman's bust\r\n     And strew their laurels o'er each warrior's dust,\r\n     Alike immortalise, as good and great,\r\n     Him who enslaved as him who saved the State,\r\n     Surely the Muse (a rustic minstrel) may\r\n     Drop one wild flower upon a poor man's clay.\r\n     This artless tribute to his mem'ry give\r\n     Whose life was such as heroes seldom live.\r\n     In worldly knowledge, poor indeed his store--\r\n     He knew the village, and he scarce knew more.\r\n     The worth of heavenly truth he justly knew--\r\n     In faith a Christian, and in practice too.\r\n     Yes, here lies one, excel him ye who can:\r\n     Go! imitate the virtues of that man!\r\n\r\nThe famous \"Amen\" epitaph at Crayford, Kent, is well known, though the\r\nname of the clerk who is thus commemorated is sometimes forgotten. It is\r\nto the memory of one Peter Snell, who repeated his \"Amens\" diligently\r\nfor a period of thirty years, and runs as follows:\r\n\r\n     Here lieth the body of\r\n     Peter Snell,\r\n     Thirty years clerk of this Parish.\r\n     He lived respected as a pious and mirthful man,\r\n     and died on his way to church to\r\n     assist at a wedding,\r\n     on the 31st of March, 1811,\r\n     Aged seventy years.\r\n\r\n     The inhabitants of Crayford have raised this stone to his\r\n     cheerful memory, and as a tribute to his long and faithful\r\n     services.\r\n\r\n     The life of this clerk was just threescore and ten,\r\n     Nearly half of which time he had sung out Amen.\r\n     In his youth he had married like other young men,\r\n     But his wife died one day--so he chanted Amen.\r\n     A second he took--she departed--what then?\r\n     He married and buried a third with Amen.\r\n     Thus his joys and his sorrows were treble, but then\r\n     His voice was deep base, as he sung out Amen.\r\n     On the horn he could blow as well as most men,\r\n     So his horn was exalted to blowing Amen.\r\n     But he lost all his wind after threescore and ten,\r\n     And here with three wives he waits till again\r\n     The trumpet shall rouse him to sing out Amen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD SCARLETT]\r\n\r\nThe duties of sexton and parish clerk were usually performed by one\r\nperson, as we have already frequently noticed, and therefore it is\r\nfitting that we should record the epitaph of Old Scarlett, most famous\r\nof grave-diggers, who buried two queens, both the victims of stern\r\npersecution, ill-usage, and Tudor tyranny--Catherine, the divorced wife\r\nof Henry VIII, and poor sinning Mary Queen of Scots. His famous picture\r\nin Peterborough Cathedral, on the wall of the western transept, usually\r\nattracts the chief attention of the tourist, and has preserved his name\r\nand fame. He is represented with a spade, pickaxe, keys, and a whip in\r\nhis leathern girdle, and at his feet lies a skull. In the upper\r\nleft-hand corner appear the arms of the see of Peterborough, save that\r\nthe cross-keys are converted into cross-swords. The whip at his girdle\r\nappears to show that Old Scarlett occupied the position of dog-whipper\r\nas well as sexton. There is a description of this portrait in the _Book\r\nof Days_, wherein the writer says:\r\n\r\n     \"What a lively effigy--short, stout, hardy, self-complacent,\r\n     perfectly satisfied, and perhaps even proud of his\r\n     profession, and content to be exhibited with all its insignia\r\n     about him! Two queens had passed through his hands into that\r\n     bed which gives a lasting rest to queens and to peasants\r\n     alike. An officer of death, who had so long defied his\r\n     principal, could not but have made some impression on the\r\n     minds of bishop, dean, prebends, and other magnates of the\r\n     cathedral, and hence, as we may suppose, the erection of this\r\n     lively portraiture of the old man, which is believed to have\r\n     been only once renewed since it was first put up. Dr. Dibdin,\r\n     who last copied it, tells us that 'old Scarlett's jacket and\r\n     trunkhose are of a brownish red, his stockings blue, his\r\n     shoes black, tied with blue ribbons, and the soles of his\r\n     feet red. The cap upon his head is red, and so also is the\r\n     ground of the coat armour.'\" Beneath the portrait are these\r\n     lines:\r\n\r\n          YOU SEE OLD SCARLETTS PICTURE STAND ON HIE\r\n          BUT AT YOUR FEETE THERE DOTH HIS BODY LYE\r\n          HIS GRAVESTONE DOTH HIS AGE AND DEATH TIME SHOW\r\n          HIS OFFICE BY THEIS TOKENS YOU MAY KNOW\r\n          SECOND TO NONE FOR STRENGTH AND STURDYE LIMM\r\n          A SCARBABE MIGHTY VOICE WITH VISAGE GRIM\r\n          HEE HAD INTER'D TWO QUEENES WITHIN THIS PLACE\r\n          AND THIS TOWNES HOUSEHOLDERS IN HIS LIVES SPACE\r\n          TWICE OVER: BUT AT LENGTH HIS OWN TURNE CAME\r\n          WHAT HE FOR OTHERS DID FOR HIM THE SAME\r\n          WAS DONE: NO DOUBT HIS SOUL DOTH LIVE FOR AYE\r\n          IN HEAVEN: THOUGH HERE HIS BODY CLAD IN CLAY.\r\n\r\nOn the floor is a stone inscribed \"JULY 2 1594 R.S. ætatis 98.\" This\r\npainting is not a contemporary portrait of the old sexton, but a copy\r\nmade in 1747.\r\n\r\nThe sentiment expressed in the penult couplet is not uncommon, the idea\r\nof retributive justice, of others performing the last offices for the\r\nclerk who had so often done the like for his neighbours. The same notion\r\nis expressed in the epitaph of Frank Raw, clerk and monumental mason, of\r\nSelby, Yorkshire, which runs as follows:\r\n\r\n     Here lies the body of poor FRANK RAW\r\n       Parish clerk and gravestone cutter,\r\n     And this is writ to let you know\r\n     What Frank for others used to do\r\n       Is now for Frank done by another[48].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: _Curious Epitaphs_, by W. Andrews, p. 120.]\r\n\r\nThe achievement of Old Scarlett with regard to his interring \"the town's\r\nhouseholders in his life's space twice over,\" has doubtless been\r\nequalled by many of the long-lived clerks whose memoirs have been\r\nrecorded, but it is not always recorded on a tombstone. At\r\nRatcliffe-on-Soar there is, however, the grave of an old clerk, one\r\nRobert Smith, who died in 1782, at the advanced age of eighty-two years,\r\nand his epitaph records the following facts:\r\n\r\n     Fifty-five years it was, and something more,\r\n       Clerk of this parish he the office bore,\r\n     And in that space, 'tis awful to declare,\r\n       Two generations buried by him were[49]!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: _Ibid_. p. 121.]\r\n\r\nIt is recorded on the tomb of Hezekiah Briggs, who died in 1844 in his\r\neightieth year, the clerk and sexton of Bingley, Yorkshire, that \"he\r\nburied seven thousand corpses[50].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: _Notes and Queries_, Ninth Series, xii. 453.]\r\n\r\nThe verses written in his honour are worth quoting:\r\n\r\n     Here lies an old ringer beneath the cold clay\r\n     Who has rung many peals both for serious and gay;\r\n     Through Grandsire and Trebles with ease he could range,\r\n     Till death called Bob, which brought round the last change.\r\n\r\n       For all the village came to him\r\n         When they had need to call;\r\n       His counsel free to all was given,\r\n         For he was kind to all.\r\n\r\n     Ring on, ring' on, sweet Sabbath bell,\r\n     Still kind to me thy matins swell,\r\n     And when from earthly things I part,\r\n     Sigh o'er my grave and lull my heart.\r\n\r\nThese last four lines strike a sweet note, and are far superior to the\r\nusual class of monumental poetry. I will not guarantee the correct\r\ncopying of the third and fourth lines. Various copyists have produced\r\nvarious versions. One version runs:\r\n\r\n     Bob majors and trebles with ease he could bang,\r\n     Till Death called a bob which brought the last clang.\r\n\r\nIn Staple-next-Wingham, Kent, there is a stone to the memory of the\r\nparish clerk who died in 1820, aged eighty-six years, and thus\r\ninscribed:\r\n\r\n     He was honest and just, in friendship sincere,\r\n     And Clerk of this Parish for sixty-seven years.\r\n\r\nAt Worth Church, Sussex, near the south entrance is a headstone,\r\ninscribed thus:\r\n\r\n     In memory of John Alcorn, Clerk and Sexton of this parish,\r\n     who died Dec. 13: 1868 in the 81st year of his age.\r\n\r\n          Thine honoured friend for fifty three full years,\r\n          He saw each bridal's joy, each Burial's tears;\r\n          Within the walls, by Saxons reared of old,\r\n          By the stone sculptured font of antique mould,\r\n          Under the massive arches in the glow,\r\n          Tinged by dyed sun-beams passing to and fro,\r\n          A sentient portion of the sacred place,\r\n          A worthy presence with a well-worn face.\r\n          The lich-gate's shadow, o'er his pall at last\r\n          Bids kind adieu as poor old John goes past.\r\n          Unseen the path, the trees, the old oak door,\r\n          No more his foot-falls touch the tomb-paved floor,\r\n          His silvery head is hid, his service done\r\n          Of all these Sabbaths absent only one.\r\n          And now amidst the graves he delved around,\r\n          He rests and sleeps, beneath the hallowed ground.\r\n\r\n     Keep Innocency, and take heed unto the thing that is right,\r\n     For that shall bring a man peace at the last. Psalm XXXVII.\r\n     38.\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting memorial of an aged parish clerk in Cropthorne\r\nChurch, Worcestershire, an edifice of considerable note. It consists of\r\na small painted-glass window in the tower, containing a full-length\r\nportrait of the deceased official, duly apparelled in a cassock.\r\n\r\nThere is in the King's Norton parish churchyard an old gravestone the\r\nexistence of which I dare say a good many people had forgotten until\r\nrecently, owing to the inscription having become almost illegible.\r\nWithin the past few weeks it has been renovated, and thus a record has\r\nbeen prevented from dropping out of public memory. The stone sets forth\r\nthat it was erected to the memory of Isaac Ford, a shoemaker, who was\r\nfor sixty-two years parish clerk of King's Norton, and who died on 10\r\nJuly, 1755, aged eighty-five years. Beneath is another interesting\r\ninscription to the effect that Henry Ford, son of Isaac, who died on 11\r\nJuly, 1795, aged eighty-one, was also parish clerk for forty years. The\r\ntwo men thus held continuous office for one hundred and two years. This\r\nis a famous record of long service, though it has been surpassed by a\r\nfew others, our parish clerks being a long-lived race.\r\n\r\nAt Stoulton Church a clerk died in 1812, and it is recorded on his\r\nepitaph that \"He was clerk of this parish more 30 years and much\r\nenvied.\" It was not his office or his salary which was envied, but \"a\r\nworn't much liked by the t'others,\" and yet followed the verse:\r\n\r\n     A loving' husband, father dear,\r\n     A faithful friend lies buried here.\r\n\r\nAn epitaph without a \"werse\" was considered very degrading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE WORSHIPFUL COMPANY OF PARISH CLERKS\r\n\r\nThe story of the City companies of London has many attractions for the\r\nhistorian and antiquary. When we visit the ancient homes of these great\r\nsocieties we are impressed by their magnificence and interesting\r\nassociations. Portraits of old City worthies and royal benefactors gaze\r\nat us from the walls, and link our time with theirs, when they, too,\r\nstrove to uphold the honour of their guild and benefit their generation.\r\nMany a quaint old-time custom and ceremonial usage linger on within the\r\nold halls, and there too are enshrined cuirass and targe, helmet, sword\r\nand buckler, which tell the story of the past, and of the part the\r\ncompanies played in national defence or in the protection of civic\r\nrights. Turning down some dark alley and entering the portals of one of\r\ntheir halls, we are transported at once from the busy streets and din of\r\nmodern London into a region of old-world memories which has a\r\nfascination that is all its own.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to discuss the origin of guilds and City\r\ncompanies, which can trace back their descent to Anglo-Saxon times and\r\nwere usually of a religious type. They were the benefit societies of\r\nancient days, institutions of self-help, combining care for the needy\r\nwith the practice of religion, justice, and morality. There were guilds\r\nexclusively religious, guilds of the calendars for the clergy, social\r\nguilds for the purpose of promoting good fellowship, benevolence, and\r\nthrift, merchant guilds for the regulation of trade, and frith guilds\r\nfor the promotion of peace and the establishment of law and order.\r\n\r\nIn this goodly company we find evidences at an early date of the\r\nexistence of the Fraternity of Parish Clerks. Its long and important\r\ncareer, though it ranked not with the Livery Companies, and sent not its\r\nmembers to take part in the deliberations of the Common Council, is full\r\nof interest, and reflects the greatest credit on the worthy clerks who\r\ncomposed it.\r\n\r\nIn other cities besides London the clerks seem to have formed their\r\nguilds. As early as the time of the _Domesday Survey_ there was a\r\nclerks' guild at Canterbury, wherein it is stated \"_In civitate\r\nCantuaria habet achiepiscopus_ xii burgesses and xxxii mansuras which\r\nthe clerks of the town, _clerici de villa_, hold within their gild and\r\ndo yield xxxv shillings.\"\r\n\r\nThe first mention of the company carries us back to the early days of\r\nHenry III, when in the seventeenth year of that monarch's reign (A.D.\r\n1233), according to Stow, they were incorporated and registered in the\r\nbooks of the Guildhall. The patron saint of the company was St.\r\nNicholas, who also extended his patronage to robbers and mariners.\r\nThieves are dubbed by Shakespeare as St. Nicholas's clerks[51], and\r\nRowley calls highwaymen by the same title. Possibly this may be\r\naccounted for by the association of the light-fingered fraternity with\r\nNicholas, or Old Nick, a cant name for the devil, or because _The\r\nGolden Legend_ tells of the conversion of some thieves through the\r\nsaint's agency. At any rate, the good Bishop of Myra was the patron\r\nsaint of scholars, and therefore was naturally selected as tutelary\r\nguardian of clerks.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: _Henry IV_, act ii. sc. 1.]\r\n\r\nIn 1442 Henry VI granted a charter to \"the Chief or Parish Clerks of the\r\nCity of London for the honour and glory of Almighty God and of the\r\nundefiled and most glorious Virgin Mary, His Mother, and on account of\r\nthat special devotion, which they especially bore to Christ's glorious\r\nconfessor, St. Nicholas, on whose day or festival we were first\r\npresented into this present world, at the hands of a mother of memory\r\never to be revered.\" The charter states that they had maintained a poor\r\nbrotherhood of themselves, as well as a certain divine service, and\r\ndivine words of charity and piety, devised and exhibited by them year by\r\nyear, for forty years or more by part; and it conferred on them the\r\nright of a perpetual corporate community, having two roasters and two\r\nchaplains to celebrate divine offices every day, for the King's welfare\r\nwhether alive or dead, and for the souls of all faithful departed, for\r\never. By special royal grace they were allowed, on petitioning His\r\nMajesty, to have the charter without paying any fine or fee.\r\n\r\nSeven years later a second charter was granted, wherein it is stated\r\nthat their services were held in the Chapel of Mary Magdalene by the\r\nGuildhall. \"Bretherne and Sisterne\" were included in the fraternity. Bad\r\ntimes and the Wars of the Roses brought distress to the community, and\r\nthey prayed Edward IV to refound their guild, allowing only the\r\nmaintenance of one chaplain instead of two in the chapel nigh the\r\nGuildhall, together with the support of seven poor persons who daily\r\noffered up their prayers for the welfare of the King and the repose of\r\nthe souls of the faithful. They provided \"a prest, brede, wyne, wex,\r\nboke, vestments and chalise for their auter of S. Nicholas in the said\r\nchapel.\" The King granted their request.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MASTER'S CHAIR AT THE PARISH CLERKS HALL.]\r\n\r\nThe original home of the guild was in Bishopsgate. Brewers' Hall was, in\r\n1422, lent to them for their meetings. But the old deeds in the\r\npossession of the company show that as early as 1274 they acquired\r\nproperty \"near the King's highway in the parish of St. Ethelburga,\r\nextending from the west side of the garden of the Nuns of St. Helen's to\r\nnear the stone wall of Bishopsgate on the north, in breadth from the\r\neast side of William the Whit Tawyer's to the King's highway on the\r\nsouth.\" These two highways are now known as Bishopsgate Street and\r\nCamomile Street. They had property also at Finsbury on the east side of\r\nWhitecross Street. Inasmuch as the guild did not in those early days\r\npossess a charter and was not incorporated, it had no power to hold\r\nproperty; hence the lands were transmitted to individual members of the\r\nfraternity[52]. After their incorporation in 1442 the trustees of the\r\nlands and possessions were all clerks. Another property belonged to them\r\nat Enfield.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: The transmission of the property is carefully traced in\r\n_Some Account of Parish Clerks_, by Mr. James Christie, p. 78. He had\r\naccess to the company's muniments.]\r\n\r\nThe chief possession of the clerks was the Bishopsgate property. It\r\nconsisted of an inn called \"The Wrestlers,\" another inn which bore the\r\nsign of \"The Angel,\" and a fair entry or gate near the latter which\r\nstill bears the name Clerks' Place. Wrestlers' Court still marks the\r\nsite of the old inn--so conservative are the old names in the city of\r\nLondon. Passing through the entry we should have seen seven modest\r\nalmshouses for the brethren and sisters of the guilds. Beyond these was\r\nthe hall of the company. It consisted of a parlour (36 ft. by 14 ft.),\r\nwith three chambers over it. The east side with fan glasses overlooked\r\nthe garden, 72 ft. in length by 21 ft. wide. The west side was lined\r\nwith wainscot. The actual hall adjoined, a fine room 30 ft. by 25 ft.,\r\nwith a gallery at the nether end, with a little parlour at the west end.\r\nA room for the Bedell, a kitchen with a vault under it, larder-rooms,\r\nbuttery, and a little house called the Ewery, completed the buildings.\r\nIt must have been a very delightful little home for the company, not so\r\npalatial as that of some of the greater guilds, but compact, charming,\r\nand altogether attractive.\r\n\r\nBut evil days set in for the City companies of London. Spoliation,\r\ngreed, destruction were in the air. Churches, monasteries, charities\r\nfelt the rude hand of the spoiler, and it could scarcely be that the\r\nrich corporations of the City should fail to attract the covetous eyes\r\nof the rapacious courtiers. They were forced to surrender all their\r\nproperty which had been used for so-called \"superstitious\" purposes, and\r\nmost of them bought this back with large sums of money, which went into\r\nthe coffers of the King or his ministers. The Parish Clerks' Company\r\nfared no better than the rest. Their hall was seized by the King, or\r\nrather by the infamous courtiers of Edward VI, and sold, together with\r\nthe almshouses, to Sir Robert Chester in 1548. He at once took\r\npossession of the property, but the clerks protested that they had been\r\nwrongfully despoiled, and again seized their rightful possessions. In\r\nspite of the sympathy and support of the Lord Mayor, who \"communed with\r\nthe wardens of the Great Companies for their gentle aid to be granted to\r\nthe parish clerks towards their charges in defence of their title to\r\ntheir Common Hall and lands,\" the clerks lost their case, and were\r\ncompelled to give up their home or submit to a heavy fine of 1000 marks\r\nbesides imprisonment. The poor dispossessed clerks were defeated, but\r\nnot disheartened. In the days of Queen Mary they renewed their suit, and\r\n\"being likely to have prevailed, Sir Robert Chester pulled down the\r\nhall, sold the timber, stone and land, and thereupon the suit was\r\nended\"--very summary conclusion truly!\r\n\r\nThe Lord Mayor and his colleagues again showed sympathy and compassion\r\nfor the dispossessed clerks, and offered them the church of the Hospital\r\nof St. Mary of Bethlehem in 1552 for their meetings. They did not lack\r\nfriends. William Roper, whose picture still hangs in the hall of the\r\ncompany, the son-in-law of Sir Thomas More, was a great benefactor, who\r\nbequeathed to them some tenements in Southwark on condition that they\r\nshould distribute £4 among the poor prisoners in Newgate and other\r\njails. He was the biographer of Sir Thomas More, and died in 1577.\r\n\r\nIn 1610 the clerks applied for a new charter, and obtained it from James\r\nI, under the title of \"The Parish Clerks of the Parishes and Parish\r\nChurches of the City of London, the liberties thereof and seven out of\r\nnine out-parishes adjoining.\" They were required to make returns for the\r\nbills of mortality and of the deaths of freemen. The masters and wardens\r\nhad power granted to them to examine clerks as to whether they could\r\nsing the Psalms of David according to the usual tunes used in the parish\r\nchurches, and whether they were sufficiently qualified to make their\r\nweekly returns. In 1636 a new charter was granted by Charles I, and\r\nagain in 1640, this last charter being that by which the company is now\r\ngoverned. By this instrument their jurisdiction was extended so as to\r\ninclude Hackney and the other fifteen out-parishes, and they gained the\r\nright of collecting their own wages, and of suing for it in the\r\necclesiastical courts, and of printing the bills of mortality.\r\n\r\nSoon after the company lost their hall through the high-handed\r\nproceedings of Sir Robert Chester, they purchased or leased a new hall,\r\nwhich was situated at the north-east corner of Brode Lane, Vintry, where\r\nthey lived from 1562, until the Great Fire in 1666 again made them\r\nhomeless. The Sun Tavern in Leadenhall Street, the Green Dragon,\r\nQueenhythe, the Quest House, Cripplegate, the Gun, near Aldgate, and the\r\nMitre in Fenchurch Street, afforded them temporary accommodation. In\r\n1669 they began to arrange for a new hall to be built off Wood Street,\r\nwhich was completed in 1671, and has since been their home. Various sums\r\nof money have been voted at different times for its repair or\r\nembellishment. It has once been damaged by fire, and on another occasion\r\nseverely threatened. In 1825 the entrance into Wood Street was blocked\r\nup and the entrance into Silver Street opened. The hall has been a\r\nfavourite place of meeting for several other companies--the Fruiterers'\r\nCompany, the Tinplate Workers' Company, the Society of Porters, and\r\nother private companies have been their tenants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTRAIT OF WILLIAM ROPER SON-IN-LAW AND BIOGRAPHER OF\r\nSIR THOMAS MORE, BENEFACTOR OF THE CLERKS' COMPANY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GRANT OF ARMS TO THE COMPANY OF PARISH CLERKS.]\r\n\r\nI had recently the privilege of visiting the Parish Clerks' Hall, and\r\nwas kindly conducted there by Mr. William John Smith, the \"Father\" of\r\nthe company, and a liberal benefactor, whose portrait hangs in the\r\nhall. He has been three times master, and his father and grandfather\r\nwere members of the fraternity.\r\n\r\nThe premises consist of a ground floor with cellars, which are let for\r\nprivate purposes, and a first floor with two rooms of moderate size. The\r\nold courtyard is now covered with business offices. Over the court-room\r\ndoor stands a copy of the Clerks' Arms, which are thus described: \"The\r\nfeyld azur, a flower de lice goulde on chieffe gules, a leopard's head\r\nbetwen two pricksonge bookes of the second, the laces that bind the\r\nbooks next, and to the creast upon the healme, on a wreathe gules and\r\nazur, an arm, from the elbow upwards, holding a pricking book, 30th\r\nMarch, 1582.\" These are the arms \"purged of superstition\" by Robert\r\nCook, Clarencieux Herald, on the aforementioned date. The company's\r\nmotto is, _Unitas Societatis Stabilitas_. The arms over the court-room\r\ndoor have the motto _Pange lingua gloriosa_, which is accounted for by\r\nthe fact that this copy of the clerks' heraldic achievement formerly\r\nstood over the organ in the hall. This organ is a small but pleasant\r\ninstrument, and was purchased in 1737 in order to enable the members to\r\npractise psalmody. Several portraits of worthy clerks adorn the walls.\r\nAmongst them we notice that of William Roper, a benefactor of the\r\ncompany, whose name has been already mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of John Clarke shows a firm, dignified old man, who was the\r\nparish clerk of St. Michael's, Cornhill, in 1805, and wrote extracts\r\nfrom the minute-books of the company. The picture was presented to the\r\ncompany in 1827. There are other portraits of worthy clerks, of Richard\r\nHust, who died in 1835, and was a great benefactor of the company and\r\nthe restorer of the almshouses; of James Mayhew (1896), and of William\r\nJohn Smith (1903).\r\n\r\nIn one of the windows is the portrait, in stained glass, of John Clarke,\r\nparish clerk of Bartholomew-the-Less, London, master of the company,\r\nA.D. 1675, _ætatis suæ_ 45. He is represented with a dark skull cap on\r\nhis head, long hair, a moustache, and a large falling band or collar.\r\n\r\nThere are also portraits in stained glass of Stephen Penckhurst, parish\r\nclerk of St. Mary Magdalene, Fish Street, London, master in 1685; of\r\nJames Maddox, parish clerk of St. Olive's, Jury, master in 1684; of\r\nNicholas Hudles, parish clerk of St. Andrew's, Undershaft, twice master,\r\nin 1674 and 1682; of Thomas Williams, parish clerk of St. Mary\r\nMagdalene, Bermondsey, master in 1680; of Robert Seal, parish clerk of\r\nSt. Gregory, master in 1681; of William Disbrow, parish clerk of St.\r\nVedast, Foster Lane, and of St. Michael Le Querne, master in 1674; and\r\nof William Hornbuck, parish clerk of St. James, Clerkenwell, master\r\nin 1679.\r\n\r\nOne of the windows has a curious emblematical representation of music\r\nand its effects, showing King David surrounded by cherubs. The royal\r\narms of the time of Charles II, the arms of the company, the arms of the\r\nPrince of Wales, and a portrait of Queen Anne also appear in\r\nthe windows.\r\n\r\nThe master's chair was presented by Samuel Andrews, master in 1716,\r\nwhich date appears on the back together with the arms of the company,\r\nthe crest being an arm raised bearing a scroll on which is inscribed the\r\nninety-fourth Psalm. The seat of the chair is cane webbing. Psalm x. is\r\ninscribed on the front, and below is the fleur-de-lis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STAINED GLASS WINDOW AT THE HALL OF THE PARISH CLERKS'\r\nCOMPANY]\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting warden's or clerk's chair, made of mahogany,\r\ndating about the middle of the eighteenth century, and some walnut\r\nchairs fashioned in 1690.\r\n\r\nAmongst other treasures I noticed an old Dutch chest, an ancient clock,\r\nthe gift of the master and wardens in 1786, a reprint of Visscher's View\r\nof London in 1616, the grant of arms to the company, a panel painting of\r\nthe Flight into Egypt, and the Orders and Rules of the company in 1709.\r\n\r\nA snuff-box made of the wood of the _Victory_, mounted in silver, is one\r\nof the clerks' valued possessions, and they have a goodly store of\r\nplate, in spite of the fact that they, like many of their distinguished\r\nbrethren, the Livery Companies of the City, have been obliged at various\r\ncritical times in their history to dispose of their plate in order to\r\nmeet the heavy demands upon their treasury. They still possess their\r\npall, which is used on the occasion of the funeral of deceased members,\r\nand also \"two garlands of crimson velvet embroidered\" bearing the date\r\n1601, which were formerly used at the election of the two masters. The\r\nmaster now wears a silver badge, the gift of Richard Perkins in 1879,\r\nwhich bears the inscription: _Hoc insigne in usum Magistri D.D.\r\nRichardus Perkins, SS. Augustini et Fidis Clericus, his Magistri\r\n1878, 1879_.\r\n\r\nBy far the most interesting document in the possession of the company is\r\nthe Bede Roll, which contains a list of the members of the fraternity\r\nfrom the time of Henry VI. The writing is magnificent, and the lettering\r\nvaries in colours--red, blue, and black ink having been used. Amongst\r\nthe distinguished names of the honorary members I noticed John Mowbray,\r\nDuke of Norfolk, and Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury.\r\n\r\nThe company, by the aid of generous benefactors, looks well after the\r\npoor widows of clerks and the decayed brethren, bestowing upon them\r\nadequate pensions for their support in their indigence and old age.\r\nThese benefactions entrusted to the care of the company, and the gifts\r\nby its members of plate and other treasures, show the affectionate\r\nregard of the parish clerks for their ancient and interesting\r\nassociations, which has done much to preserve the dignity of the office,\r\nto keep inviolate its traditions, and to improve the status of\r\nits members.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PAGE OF THE BEDE ROLL OF THE PARISH CLERKS' COMPANY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE CLERKS OF LONDON: THEIR DUTIES AND PRIVILEGES\r\n\r\nA brief study of the history of the Parish Clerks' Company has already\r\nrevealed the important part which its members played in the old City\r\nlife of London. They were intimately connected with the Corporation. The\r\nclerks held their services in the Guildhall Chapel, and were required on\r\nMichaelmas Day to sing the Mass before the Lord Mayor, aldermen, and\r\ncommoners before they went to the election of a new Lord Mayor. As early\r\nas the days of the famous Richard Whittington, on the occasion of his\r\nfirst election to the mayoralty, which as the popular rhyme says he held\r\nthree times, we hear of their services being required for this\r\ngreat function.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1406 it was ordered that \"a Mass of the Holy Ghost should be\r\ncelebrated with solemn music in the chapel annexed to the Guildhall, to\r\nthe end that the same commonalty by the grace of the Holy Spirit might\r\nbe able peacefully and amicably to nominate two able and proper persons\r\nto be mayor of the City for the ensuing year, the same Mass, by the\r\nordinance of the Chamberlain for the time being, to be solemnly chanted\r\nby the finest singers, in the chapel aforesaid and upon that feast.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when the Mass was no longer sung in the chapel of the Guildhall,\r\nthey still chanted the Psalms and anthems before and after divine\r\nservice and sermon, sometimes with the help of \"two singing men of\r\nPaul's,\" who received twelvepence apiece for their pains; and sometimes\r\nthe singing was done by a convenient number of the Clerks' Company most\r\nskilful in singing, and deemed most fit by the master and wardens to\r\nperform that service.\r\n\r\nThey were in great request at the great and stately funerals of the\r\nsixteenth century, going before the hearse and singing with their\r\nsurplices hanging on their arms till they came to the church. The\r\nchanges wrought by the Reformation strongly affected their use. In the\r\nearly years of the century we can hear them chanting anthems, dirige,\r\nand Mass; later on they sing \"the Te Deum in English new fashion, Geneva\r\nwise--men, women and all do sing and boys.\"\r\n\r\nThese splendid funerals were a fruitful source of income to the Clerks'\r\nCompany. We see Masters William Holland and John Aungell, clerks of the\r\nBrotherhood of St. Nicholas, with twenty-four persons and three children\r\nsinging the Masses of Our Lady, the Trinity and Requiem at the interment\r\nof Sir Thomas Lovell, the sage and witty counsellor of King Henry VIII\r\nand Constable of the Tower, while sixty-four more clerks met the body on\r\nits way and conducted it to its last resting-place at Holywell,\r\nShoreditch. Perhaps it was not without some satisfaction that the clerks\r\ntook a prominent part in the burial of the Duke of Somerset, the\r\niniquitous spoiler of their goods. In the ordinances of the companies\r\nissued in 1553, very minute regulations are laid down with regard to\r\nthe fees for funerals and the order in which each clerk should serve. At\r\nthe burials of \"noble honourable, worshipful men or women or citizens of\r\nthe City of London,\" the attendance of the clerks was limited to the\r\nnumber asked for by the friends of the deceased. No person was to\r\nreceive more than eight-pence. The beadle might charge fourpence for the\r\nuse of the hearse cloth. An extra charge of fourpence could be made if\r\nthe clerks were wanted both in the afternoon and in the forenoon for the\r\nsermon or other service. The bearers might have twopence more than the\r\nusual wage. Each clerk was to have his turn in attending funerals, so\r\nthat no one man might be taken for favour or left out for displeasure.\r\n\r\nThe records of these gorgeous funerals, which are preserved in Machyn's\r\ndiary and other chronicles, reveal the changes wrought by the spread of\r\nReformation principles and Puritan notions. In Mary's reign they were\r\nvery magnificent, \"priests and clerks chanting in Latin, the priest\r\nhaving a cope and the clerk the holy water sprinkle in his hand.\" The\r\naccession of Elizabeth seems at first to have wrought little change, and\r\nthe services of the Clerks' Company were in great request. On 21\r\nOctober, 1559, \"the Countess of Rutland was brought from Halewell to\r\nShoreditch Church with thirty priests and clarkes singing,\" and \"Sir\r\nThomas Pope was buried at Clerkenwell with two services of pryke\r\nsong[53], and two masses of requiem and all clerkes of London.\" \"Poules\r\nChoir and the Clarkes of London\" united their services on some\r\noccasions. Funeral sermons began to be considered an important part of\r\nthe function, and Machyn records the names of the preachers. Even though\r\nsuch keen Protestants as Coverdale, Bishop Pilkington, Robert Crowley,\r\nand Veron preached the sermons, twenty clerks of the company were\r\nusually present singing. Machyn much disliked the innovations made by\r\nthe Puritan party, their singing \"Geneva wise\" or \"the tune of Genevay,\"\r\nmen, women, and children all singing together, without any clerk. Here\r\nis a description of such a funeral on 7 March, 1559: \"And there was a\r\ngreat company of people two and two together, and neither priest nor\r\nclarke, the new preachers in their gowns like laymen, neither singing\r\nnor saying till they came to the grave, and afore she was put in the\r\ngrave, a collect in English, and then put in the grave, and after, took\r\nsome earth and cast it on the corse, and red a thyng ... for the sam,\r\nand contenent cast the earth into the grave, and contenent read the\r\nEpistle of St. Paul to the Stesselonyans the ... chapter, and after they\r\nsang _Pater noster_ in English, bothe preachers and other, and ... of a\r\nnew fashion, and after, one of them went into the pulpit and made a\r\nsermon.\" Machyn especially disliked the preacher Veron, rector of St.\r\nMartin's, Ludgate, a French Protestant, who had been ordained by Bishop\r\nRidley, and was \"a leader in the change from the old ecclesiastical\r\nmusic for the services to the Psalms in metre, versified by Sternhold\r\nand Hopkins[54].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: The notes of the harmony were pricked on the lines of\r\nmusic.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: _Some Account of Parish Clerks_, by J. Christie, p. 153.]\r\n\r\nThe clerks indirectly caused the disgrace and suspension of Robert\r\nCrowley, vicar of St. Giles, Cripplegate, and prebendary of St. Paul's\r\nCathedral, a keen Puritan and hater of clerkly ways. He loathed\r\nsurplices as \"rags of Popery,\" and could not bear to see the clerks\r\nmarching in orderly procession singing and chanting. A funeral took\r\nplace at his church on 1 April, 1566. A few days before, the Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury had issued his Advertisements ordering the use of the\r\nsurplice. The friends of the deceased had engaged the services of the\r\nparish clerks, who, believing that the order with regard to the use of\r\nsurplices applied to them as well as to the clergy, appeared at the door\r\nof the church attired according to their ancient usage. A scene\r\noccurred. The angry Crowley met them at the door and bade them take off\r\nthose \"porter's coats.\" The deputy of the ward supported the vicar and\r\nthreatened to lay them up by the feet if they dared to enter the church\r\nin such obnoxious robes. There was a mighty disturbance. \"Those who took\r\ntheir part according to the queen's prosedyngs were fain to give over\r\nand tarry without the church door.\" The Lord Mayor's attention was\r\ncalled to this disgraceful scene. He complained to the archbishop. The\r\ndeputy of the ward was bound over to keep the peace, and Crowley was\r\nordered to stay in his house, and for not wearing a surplice was\r\ndeprived of his living, to which he was again appointed twelve years\r\nlater[55]. The clerks triumphed, but their services at funerals soon\r\nceased. Puritan opinions spread; no longer did the clerks lead the\r\nsinging and processions at funereal pageants, and a few boys from\r\nChrist's Hospital or school children took their places in\r\ndegenerate days.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: _Some Account of Parish Clerks_, by J. Christie, p. 154.]\r\n\r\nThe Parish Clerks' Company were not a whit behind other City companies\r\nin their love of processions and pageantry, and their annual feasts and\r\nelections were conducted with great ceremony and magnificence. The\r\nelections took place on Ascension Day, and the feast on the following\r\nMonday. The clerks in 1529 were ordered to come to the Guildhall College\r\non the Sunday before Whit-Sunday to Evensong clad in surplices, and on\r\nthe following day to attend Mass, when each man offered one halfpenny.\r\nWhen Mass was over they marched in procession wearing copes from the\r\nGuildhall to Clerks' Hall, where the feast was held. Fines were levied\r\nfor absence or non-obedience to these observances. Machyn describes the\r\naccustomed usages in Mary's reign as follows: \"The sixth of May was a\r\ngoodly evensong at Yeldhall College with singing and playing as you have\r\nheard. The morrow after was a great Mass at the same place by the same\r\nFraternity, when every clerk offered a halfpenny. The Mass was sung by\r\ndivers of the Queen's Chapel and children. And after Mass was done every\r\nclerk went their procession, two and two together, each having a\r\nsurplice, a rich cope and a garland. After them fourscore standards,\r\nstreamers and banners, and every one that bare had an albe, or else a\r\nsurplice, and two and two together. Then came the waits playing, and\r\nthen between, thirty Clarkes again singing _Salva festa dies_. So there\r\nwere four quires. Then came a canopy, borne by four of the masters of\r\nthe Clarkes over the Sacrament with a twelve staff torches burning, up\r\nSt. Lawrence Lane and so to the further end of Cheap, then back again by\r\nCornhill, and so down to Bishopsgate, into St. Albrose Church, and there\r\nthey did put off their copes, and so to dinner every man, and then\r\neveryone that bare a streamer had money, as they were of bigness then.\"\r\nA very striking procession it must have been, and those who often\r\ntraverse the familiar streets of the City to-day can picture to\r\nthemselves the clerks' pageant of former times, which wended its way\r\nalong the same accustomed thoroughfares.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ORGAN AT THE PARISH CLERKS HALL]\r\n\r\nBut times were changing, and religious ceremonies changed too. Less\r\npomp and pageantry characterise the celebrations of the clerks. There is\r\nthe Evensong as usual, and a Communion on the following day, followed by\r\na dinner and \"a goodly concert of children of Westminster, with viols\r\nand regals.\" A little later we read that the clerks marched clad in\r\ntheir liveries, gowns, and hoods of white damask. Copes are no longer\r\nrecognised as proper vestments. Standards, banners, and streamers remain\r\nlocked up in the City's treasure-house, and Puritan simplicity is duly\r\nobserved. But the clerks lacked not feasting. Besides the election\r\ndinner, there were quarterly dinners, and dinners for the wardens and\r\nassistants. Time has wrought some changes in the mode of celebrating\r\nelection day and other festive occasions. Sometimes \"plain living and\r\nhigh thinking\" were the watchwords that guided the principles of the\r\ncompany. Processions and gown-wearing have long been discontinued, but\r\nin its essential character the election day is still observed, though\r\npomp and pageantry no longer form important features of its ceremonial.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the parish clerks of London were in great request on\r\naccount of their musical abilities. In 1610 the masters and wardens were\r\ncalled upon to examine all those who wished to be admitted into the\r\nhonourable company, as to whether they could read the Psalms of David\r\naccording to the usual tunes used in the parish churches. The finest\r\nsingers chanted Mass in pre-Reformation times in the Guildhall at the\r\nelection of the Lord Mayor. In order to improve themselves in this part\r\nof their duties, the parish clerks soon after the Restoration of the\r\nmonarchy, in 1660, provided themselves with an organ in order to perfect\r\nthemselves in the art of chanting. The minute book of the company tells\r\nthat it was acquired \"the better to enable them to perform a service\r\nincumbent upon them before the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the City on\r\nMichaelmas Day, and also the better to enable them who already are, or\r\nhereafter shall be, parish clerks of the City in performing their duties\r\nin the several parishes to which they stand related.\" Here the clerks\r\nused to meet on Tuesday afternoons for a regular weekly practice in\r\nmusic, and for many years an organist was appointed by the company to\r\nassist the brethren in their cultivation of psalmody. The selection of\r\npsalms specially suited for each Sunday in the year was made by the\r\ncompany and set forth in _The Parish Clerks' Guide_, in order that the\r\nspecial teaching of the Sunday, as set forth in the Collect, Epistle,\r\nand Gospel, might be duly followed in the Psalms.\r\n\r\nAnother important duty which the parish clerks of London, and also in\r\nsome provincial towns, discharged was the publishing of the bills of\r\nmortality for the City. This duty is enjoined in their charter of 1610.\r\nThe corporation required from them returns of the deaths of freemen in\r\ntheir respective parishes, and also returns of the number of deaths and\r\nchristenings. The records of the City of London contain a copy of the\r\nagreement, made in 1545-6 between the Lord Mayor and the Parish Clerks'\r\nCompany, which provides that \"They shall cause all clerks of the City to\r\npresent to the common crier the name and surname of any freeman that\r\nshall die having any children under the age of 21 years.\" The\r\nChamberlain was instructed to pay to the company 13 s. 4 d. yearly for\r\ntheir services. The custody of all orphans, with that of their lands and\r\ngoods, had been entrusted to the City by the charter of Richard III, and\r\nthis agreement was made in order to enable the \"City Fathers\" to\r\nfaithfully discharge their duties in looking after children of deceased\r\nfreemen. In spite of many difficulties, especially after the Great Fire\r\nwhich rendered thousands homeless and scattered the population, the\r\nclerks continued to perform this duty, though not always to the\r\nsatisfaction of their employers, until the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, when the custom seems to have lapsed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PAGE OF AN EARLY BILL OF MORTALITY PRESERVED AT THE\r\nHALL OF THE PARISH CLERKS COMPANY]\r\n\r\nThe earliest bills of mortality now in existence date back to the time\r\nof Henry VIII, when the clerks were required to furnish information with\r\nregard to the deaths caused by plague, as well as those resulting from\r\nother causes. The returns of the victims of plague are occasionally very\r\nlarge. In 1562, 20,372 persons died, of which number 17,404 died from\r\nthe plague. The burial grounds of the City became terribly overcrowded,\r\nand the parish clerks were ordered to report upon the space available in\r\nthe City churchyards. They also were appointed to see to \"the shutting\r\nup of infected houses and putting papers on the doors.\"\r\n\r\nAn early \"Bill of Mortality\" is preserved at the Hall. It tells of \"the\r\nNumber of those who dyed in the Citie of London and Liberties of the\r\nsame from the 28th of December 1581 to the 17th of December 1582, with\r\nthe Christenings. And also the number of all those who have died of the\r\nplague in every parish particularly. Blessed are the Dead.\" There is\r\nalso preserved a number of the weekly bills of mortality. Referring to\r\nthe year of the Great Plague, 1665, these documents show that at the\r\nbeginning of the pestilence in April, during one week only fifty-seven\r\npersons died; whereas in September the death-roll had reached the\r\nenormous number of 6544.\r\n\r\nThe company seems to have been a useful agency for carrying out all\r\nkinds of duties connected with gathering the statistics of mortality,\r\nnor do they seem to have been overpaid for their trouble. In the early\r\nyears of the seventeenth century £ 3. 6 s. 8 d. was all that they\r\nreceived. In 1607 the sum was increased to £8, inasmuch as they were\r\nordered to furnish a bill to the Queen and the Lord Chancellor as well\r\nas to the King. Some clerks endeavoured to make illicit gains by\r\nsupplying the public with \"false and untrue bills,\" or distributing some\r\nbills for each week before they had been sent to the Lord Mayor; and any\r\nbrother who \"by any cunning device gave away, dispersed, uttered, or\r\ndeclared, or by sinister device cast forth at any window, hole, or\r\ncrevice of a wall any bills or notes\" before the due returns had been\r\nsent to the Lord Mayor, was ordered to pay a fine of 10 s. and other\r\ndivers penalties.\r\n\r\nThe methods of making out these returns are very curious, and did not\r\nconduce to infallible accuracy. In each parish there were persons called\r\nsearchers, ancient women who were informed by the sexton of a death, and\r\nwhose duty it was to visit the deceased and state the cause of death.\r\nThey had no medical knowledge, and therefore their diagnosis could only\r\nhave been very conjectural. This they reported to the parish clerk. The\r\nclerk made out his bill for the week, took it to the Hall of the\r\ncompany, and deposited it in a box on the staircase. All the returns\r\nwere then tabulated, arranged, and printed, and when copies had been\r\nsent to the authorities, others were placed in the hands of the\r\nclerks for sale.\r\n\r\nThe system was all very excellent and satisfactory, but its carrying out\r\nwas defective. Negligent clerks did not send their returns in spite of\r\nadmonition, caution, fine, or brotherly persuasion. The searchers'\r\ninformation was usually unreliable. Complications arose on account of\r\nthe Act of the Commonwealth Parliament requiring the registration of\r\nbirths instead of baptisms, of civil marriages, and banns published in\r\nthe market place; also on account of the vast mortality caused by the\r\nGreat Plague, the burials in the large common pits and public burial\r\ngrounds, and the opposition of the Quakers to inspection and\r\nregistration. All these causes contributed to the issuing of unreliable\r\nreturns. The company did their best to grapple with all these\r\ndifficulties. They did not escape censure, and were blamed on account of\r\nthe faults of individual clerks. The contest went on for years, and was\r\nonly finally settled in 1859, when the last bills of mortality were\r\nissued, and the Public Registration Act rendered the work of the clerks,\r\nwhich they had carried on for three centuries to the best of their skill\r\nand ability, unnecessary. In the Guildhall Library are preserved a large\r\nnumber of the volumes of these bills which the industry of the clerks of\r\nLondon had issued with so much perseverance and energy under difficult\r\ncircumstances, and they form a valuable and interesting collection of\r\ndocuments illustrative of the old life of the City.\r\n\r\nOne happy result of the duty laid upon the clerks of issuing bills of\r\nmortality in the City of London was that they were allowed to set up a\r\nprinting press in the Hall of their company. The licence for this press\r\nwas obtained in 1625, and in the following year it was duly established\r\nwith the consent of the authorities. It was no easy task in the early\r\nStuart times to obtain leave to have a printing press, and severe were\r\nthe restrictions laid down, and the penalties for any violation of any\r\nof them. The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London had\r\nmighty powers over the Press, and the clerks could not choose their\r\nprinter save with the approval of these ecclesiastical dignitaries.\r\n\r\nVery strict regulations were laid down by the company in order to\r\nprevent any improper use being made of the productions of their press.\r\nThe door of the chamber containing their printing machine was provided\r\nwith three locks; the key of the upper lock was placed in the charge of\r\nthe upper master, that of the middle lock was in the custody of the\r\nupper warden, while the key of the lower lock was kept by the under\r\nwarden. They appointed one Richard Hodgkinson as their printer in 1630,\r\nwith whom they had much disputing. Six years later one of their own\r\ncompany, Thomas Cotes, parish clerk of Cripplegate Without, was chosen\r\nto succeed him. Richard Cotes followed in 1641, and then a female\r\nprinter carried on the work, Mrs. Ellinor Cotes, probably the widow\r\nof Richard.\r\n\r\nThe Great Fire caused the destruction of the clerks' press; but a few\r\nyears later a prominent member of the company, whose portrait we see in\r\nthe Hall, Mr. John Clarke, procured for them another press with type,\r\nand Andrew Clarke was appointed printer. He was succeeded by Benjamin\r\nMotte, whose widow carried on the work after his death. An intruding\r\nprinter, appointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of\r\nLondon without the consent of the company, one Humphreys, made his\r\nappearance, much to the displeasure of the clerks, who objected to be\r\ndictated to with regard to the choice of their own official. Litigation\r\nensued, but in the end Humphreys was appointed. He was not a\r\nsatisfactory printer, and was careless and neglectful. The clerks\r\nreprimanded him and he promised amendment, but his errors continued,\r\nand after a petition was presented to the Archbishop and the Bishop of\r\nLondon by the company, he was compelled to resign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE HALL OF THE PARISH CLERKS COMPANY]\r\n\r\nThe increase of newspapers and the publication of the bills of mortality\r\nin their sheets taken from the records of the clerks materially affected\r\nthe sale of the company's issue of the same, and efforts were made in\r\nParliament to obtain a monopoly for the company. This action was costly,\r\nand no benefit was derived. After the removal of the unsatisfactory\r\nHumphreys the printing of the company passed into the hands of the\r\nRivingtons, a name honoured amongst printers and publishers for many\r\ngenerations. Mr. Charles Rivington was printer for the clerks in 1787,\r\nhis brother being a bookseller in St. Paul's Churchyard, to whose son's\r\nwidow, Mrs. Anne Rivington, the office passed in 1790. The printing of\r\nthe bills of mortality was carried on by the company until 1850, having\r\nbeen conducted by the Rivington family for over sixty years[56].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: I am indebted for this list of printers to Mr. James\r\nChristie's _Some Account of Parish Clerks_.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to their statistical returns, the Company of Parish Clerks\r\nare responsible for some other and more important works which reflect\r\ngreat credit upon them. Foremost among them is a book entitled:\r\n\r\n\"_New Remarks of London_; or, a Survey of the Cities of London and\r\nWestminster, of Southwark and part of Middlesex and Surrey within the\r\ncircumference of the Bills of Mortality.\" It contains \"an account of the\r\nsituation, antiquity, and rebuilding of each church, the value of the\r\nRectory or Vicarage, in whose gifts they are, and the names of the\r\npresent incumbents or lecturers.

MICHAEL. CORNHILL]\r\n\r\nThis is a wonderfully interesting little book. Each clerk compiled the\r\ninformation for his own parish and appended his name. Most carefully is\r\nthe information contained in the book arranged, and the volume is a most\r\ncreditable production of the worshipful company.\r\n\r\nAmongst the books preserved in the Hall is another volume, entitled\r\n\"_London Parishes_; containing an account of the Rise, Corruption, and\r\nReformation of the Church of England.\" This was published by the parish\r\nclerks in 1824.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nCLERKENWELL AND CLERKS' PLAYS\r\n\r\nParish clerks are immortalised by having given their name to an\r\nimportant part of London. Clerkenwell is the _fons clericorum_ of the\r\nold chronicler, Fitz-Stephen. It is the Clerks' Well, the syllable _en_\r\nbeing the form of the old Saxon plural. Fitz-Stephen wrote in the time\r\nof King Stephen: \"There are also round London on the northern side, in\r\nthe suburbs, excellent springs, the water of which is sweet, clear,\r\nsalubrious, 'mid glistening pebbles gliding playfully; amongst which\r\nHolywell, Clerkenwell, (_fons clericorum_), and St. Clement's Well are\r\nof most note, and most frequently visited, as well by the scholars from\r\nthe schools as by the youth of the City when they go out to take air in\r\nthe summer evenings.\"\r\n\r\nIt was then, and for centuries later, a rural spot, not far from the\r\nCity, just beyond Smithfield, a place of green sward and gently sloping\r\nground, watered by a pleasant stream, far different from the crowded\r\nstreets of the modern Clerkenwell. It was a spot famous for athletic\r\ncontests, for wrestling bouts and archery, and hither came the Lord\r\nMayor, sheriffs, and aldermen at Bartholomew Fair time to witness the\r\nsports, and especially the wrestling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD MAP OF CLERKENWELL]\r\n\r\nBut that which gave to the place its name and chief glory was the\r\nfact that once a year at least the parish clerks of London came here to\r\nperform their mystery plays and moralities. \"Their profession,\" wrote\r\nWarton[57], \"employment and character, naturally dictated to this\r\nspiritual brotherhood the representation of plays, especially those of\r\nthe scriptural kind, and their constant practice in shows, processions,\r\nand vocal music easily accounts for their address in detaining the best\r\ncompany which England afforded in the fourteenth century at a religious\r\nfarce for more than a week.\" These plays were no ordinary performances,\r\nno afternoon or evening entertainment, but a protracted drama lasting\r\nfrom three to eight days. In the reign of Richard II, A.D. 1391, the\r\nclerks were acting before the King, his Queen, and many nobles. The\r\nperformances continued for three days, and the representations were the\r\n\"Passion of Our Lord and the Creation of the World,\" which so well\r\npleased the King that he commanded £10, a very considerable sum of money\r\nin those days, to be paid to the clerks of the parish churches and to\r\ndivers other clerks of the City of London. Here is the record of\r\nhis gift:\r\n\r\n     \"_Issue Roll_, Easter, 14 Ric. II.\r\n\r\n     \"11 July. To the clerks of the parish churches and to divers\r\n     other clerks of the city of London. In money paid to them in\r\n     discharge of £10 which the Lord the King commanded to be paid\r\n     to them of his gift on account of the play of the 'Passion of\r\n     Our Lord and the Creation of the World' by them performed at\r\n     Skynnerwell after the feast of St. Bartholomew last past. By\r\n     writ of Privy Seal amongst the mandates of this term--£10.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: _English Poetry_, vol. ii. p. 397.]\r\n\r\nSkinners' Well was close to the Clerks' Well, and it was so called, so\r\nStow informs us, \"for that the Skinners of London held there certain\r\nplays yearly of Holy Scripture,\"\r\n\r\nA few years later, in the succeeding reign, 10 Henry IV, A.D. 1409, the\r\nfraternity of clerks were again performing at the same place. Stow says:\r\n\"In the year 1409 was a great play at Skynners' Welle, neere unto\r\nClarkenwell, besides London, which lasted eight daies, and was of matter\r\nfrom the creation of the world; there were to see the same the most part\r\nof the nobles and gentles in England\"--a mighty audience truly, which\r\nnot even Sir Henry Irving could command in his farewell performances at\r\nDrury Lane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MYSTERY PLAY AT CHESTER (FROM A PRINT AFTER A PAINTING\r\nBY T. UWINS)]\r\n\r\nThese religious plays or mysteries were a powerful means for instructing\r\nthe people; and if we had lived in mediæval times, we should not have\r\nneeded to fly to Ober-Ammergau in order to witness a Passion Play. In\r\nthe streets of Coventry or Chester, York, or Tewkesbury, Witney, or\r\nReading, or on the Green at Clerkenwell, we could have seen the\r\nappealing spectacle; and though sometimes the actors lapsed into\r\nbuffoonery, and the red demons carrying souls to hell's mouth created\r\nmerriment rather than terror, and though realism was carried to such a\r\npitch that Adam and Eve appeared in a state of nature, yet many of the\r\nspectators would carry away with them pious thoughts and some grasp of\r\nthe facts of Scripture history, and of the mysteries of the faith.\r\nOriginally the plays were performed in churches, but owing to the\r\ngradually increased size of the stage and the more elaborate stage\r\neffects, the sacred buildings were abandoned as the scenes of mediæval\r\ndrama. Then the churchyard was utilised for the purpose. The clergy no\r\nlonger took part in the pageants, and in the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies the people liked to act their plays in the highways and\r\npublic places as at Clerkenwell. The guilds and fraternities in many\r\nplaces provided the chief actors, and in towns where there were many\r\nguilds and companies, each company performed part of the great drama,\r\nthe movable stage being drawn about from street to street. Thus at York\r\nthe story of the Creation and the Redemption was divided into\r\nforty-eight parts, each part being acted by a guild, or group of\r\ncompanies. The Tanners represented God the Father creating the heavens,\r\nangels and archangels, and the fall of Lucifer and the disobedient\r\nangels. Then the Plasterers showed the Creation of the Earth, and the\r\nwork of the first five days. The Card-makers exhibited the Creation of\r\nAdam of the clay of the earth, and the making of Eve of Adam's rib, thus\r\ninspiring them with the breath of life. The Fall, the story of Cain and\r\nAbel, of Noah and the Flood, of Moses, the Annunciation and all Gospel\r\nhistory, ending with the Coronation of the Virgin and the\r\nFinal Judgment.\r\n\r\nThe stage upon which the clerks performed their plays, according to\r\nStrutt, consisted of three platforms, one above another. On the\r\nuppermost sat God the Father surrounded by His angels. He was\r\nrepresented in a white robe, and until it was discovered how injurious\r\nthe process was, the actor who played the part used to have his face\r\ngilded. On the second platform were the glorified saints, and on the\r\nlowest men who had not yet passed from life. On one side of the lowest\r\nplatform was hell's mouth, a dark pitchy cavern, whence issued the\r\nappearance of fire and flames, and sometimes hideous yellings and noises\r\nin imitation of the howlings and cries of wretched souls tormented by\r\nrelentless demons. From this yawning cave the devils constantly ascended\r\nto delight the spectators and afford comic relief to the more serious\r\ndrama. The three stages were not always used. Archdeacon Rogers, who\r\ndied in 1595, left an account of the Chester play which he himself saw,\r\nand he wrote that the stage was a high scaffold with two rooms, a higher\r\nand a lower, upon four wheels. In the lower the actors apparelled\r\nthemselves, and in the higher they played. But this was a movable stage\r\non wheels. The clerks' stage would, doubtless, be a fixed structure, and\r\nof a more elaborate construction.\r\n\r\nThe dresses used by the actors were very gorgeous and splendid, though\r\nlittle care was bestowed upon the appropriateness of the costumes. The\r\nwords of the play of the Creation differ in the various versions which\r\nhave come down to us. Strutt thinks that the clerks' play, acted before\r\n\"the most part of the nobles and gentles in England,\" was very similar\r\nto the Coventry play, which cannot compare in grandeur and vigour with\r\nthe York play discovered in the library of Lord Ashburnham, and edited\r\nby Miss Toulmin Smith[58]. But as the north-country dialect of the York\r\nversion would have been difficult for the learned clerks of London to\r\npronounce, their version would doubtless resemble more that of Coventry\r\nthan that of York. The first act represents the Deity seated upon His\r\nthrone and speaking as follows:\r\n\r\n       _Ego sum Alpha et Omega, principium et finis_.\r\n     My name is knowyn, God and Kynge;\r\n       My work to make now wyl I wende;\r\n     In myselfe resteth my reynenge,\r\n       It hath no gynnyng, ne no ende,\r\n     And all that evyr shall have beynge\r\n       Is closed in my mende;[59]\r\n     When it is made at my lykynge\r\n       I may it save, I may it shende[60]\r\n     After my plesawns.\"[61]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1885. A portion of this is\r\npublished in Mr. A.W. Pollard's _English Miracle Plays_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Mind.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: Destroy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: Pleasure.]\r\n\r\nAt the close of this oration, which consists of forty lines, the angels\r\nenter upon the upper stage, surround the throne of the Deity, and sing\r\nfrom the _Te Deum_:\r\n\r\n     _Te Deum laudamus, te dominum confitemur_.\r\n\r\nThe Father bestows much honour and brightness on Lucifer, who is full of\r\npride. He demands of the good angels in whose honour they are singing\r\ntheir songs of praise. Are they worshipping God or reverencing him? They\r\nreply that they are worshipping God, the mighty and most strong, who\r\nmade them and Lucifer. Then Lucifer daringly usurps the seat of the\r\nAlmighty, and receives the homage of the rebellious angels. Then the\r\nFather orders them and their leader to fall from heaven to hell, and in\r\nHis bliss never more to dwell. Then does Lucifer reply:\r\n\r\n     \"At thy byddyng y wyl I werke,\r\n     And pass from joy to peyne and smerte.\r\n     Now I am a devyl full derke,\r\n     That was an angel bryght.\r\n     Now to Helle the way I take,\r\n     In endless peyn'y to be put;\r\n     For fere of fyr apart I quake\r\n     In Helle dongeon my dene is dyth.\"\r\n\r\nThen the Devil and his angels sink into the cavern of hell's mouth.\r\n\r\nWe cannot follow all the scenes in this strange drama. The final\r\nrepresentation included the Descent into Hell, or the Harrowing of Hell,\r\nas it was called, when the soul of Christ goes down into the infernal\r\nregions and rescues Adam and Eve, Abraham, Moses, and the saints of old.\r\nThe _Anima Christi_ says:\r\n\r\n     \"Come forth, Adam and Eve, with the,\r\n     And all my fryends that herein be;\r\n     In Paradyse come forth with me,\r\n       In blysse for to dwell.\r\n     The fende of hell that is your foe,\r\n     He shall be wrappyd and woundyn in woo;\r\n     Fro wo to welth now shall ye go,\r\n       With myrth ever mo to melle.\"\r\n\r\nAdam replies:\r\n\r\n     \"I thank the Lord of thy grete grace,\r\n     That now is forgiven my great trespase;\r\n     No shall we dwell in blyssful place.\"\r\n\r\nThe accompanying print of the Descent into Hell was engraved by Michael\r\nBurghers from an ancient drawing for our Berkshire antiquary,\r\nThomas Herne.\r\n\r\nModern buildings have obliterated the scene of this ancient drama acted\r\nby the clerks of London, but some traces of the association of the\r\nfraternity with the neighbourhood can still be found. The two famous\r\nconventual houses, for which Clerkenwell was famous, the nunnery of St.\r\nMary and the priory of St. John of Jerusalem, founded in 1100, have long\r\nsince disappeared. Clerks' Close is mentioned in numerous documents, and\r\nformed part of the estate belonging to the Skinners' Company, where\r\nSkinner Street now runs. Clerks' Well was close to the modern church of\r\nSt. James's, Clerkenwell, which occupies the site of the church and\r\nnunnery of St. Mary _de fonte clericorum_, which once possessed one of\r\nthe six water-pots in which Jesus turned the water into wine. Vine\r\nStreet formerly delighted in the name Mutton Lane, which is said to be a\r\ncorruption of meeting or moteing lane, referring to the clerks' mote or\r\nmeeting place by the well. When Mr. Pink wrote his history of\r\nClerkenwell forty years ago, there was at the east side of Ray Street a\r\nbroken iron pump let into the front wall of a dilapidated house which\r\nshowed the site of Clerks' Well. In 1673 the spring and plot of ground\r\nwere given by the Earl of Northampton to the poor of the parish, but the\r\nvestry leased the spring to a brewer. Strype, writing in 1720, states\r\nthat \"the old well at Clerkenwell, whence the parish had its name, is\r\nstill known among the inhabitants. It is on the right hand of a lane\r\nthat leads from Clerkenwell to Hockley-in-the-Hole, in a bottom. One Mr.\r\nCrosse, a brewer, hath this well enclosed; but the water runs from him,\r\nby means of a watercourse above-mentioned, into the said place. It is\r\nenclosed with a high wall, which was formerly built to bound in\r\nClerkenwell Close; the present well (the conduit head) being also\r\nenclosed by another lower wall from the street. The way to it is through\r\na little house, which was the watch-house. You go down a good many steps\r\nto it. The well had formerly ironwork and brass cocks, which are now cut\r\noff; the water spins through the old wall. I was there and tasted the\r\nwater, and found it excellently clear, sweet, and well tasted.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn 1800 a pump was erected on the east side of Ray Street to celebrate\r\nthe parish clerks' ancient performances, which were immortalised in\r\nraised letters of iron with this inscription:\r\n\r\n     A.D. 1800. William Bound, Joseph Bird, Churchwardens. For the\r\n     better accommodation of the neighbourhood, this pump was\r\n     removed to the spot where it now stands. The spring by which\r\n     it is supplied is situated four feet eastward, and round it,\r\n     as history informs us, the Parish Clerks of London in remote\r\n     ages commonly performed sacred plays. That custom caused it\r\n     to be denominated Clerks'-Well, and from which this parish\r\n     derived its name. The water was greatly esteemed by the Prior\r\n     and Brethren of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem and the\r\n     Benedictine Nuns in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nHone, in his _Ancient Mysteries_, describes this pump, which in his day,\r\nA.D. 1832, stood between an earthenware shop and the abode of a\r\nbird-seller, and states that the monument denoting the histrionic fame\r\nof the place, and alluding to the miraculous powers of the water for\r\nhealing incurable diseases, remains unobserved beneath its living\r\nattractions. \"The present simplicity of the scene powerfully contrasts\r\nwith the recollection of its former splendour. The choral chant of the\r\nBenedictine Nuns, accompanying the peal of the deep-toned organ through\r\ntheir cloisters, and the frankincense curling its perfume from priestly\r\ncensers at the altar, are succeeded by the stunning sounds of numerous\r\nquickly plied hammers, and the smith's bellows flashing the fires of Mr.\r\nBound's ironfoundry, erected upon the unrecognised site of the convent.\r\nThe religious house stood about half-way down the declivity of the hill,\r\nwhich commencing near the church on Clerkenwell Green, terminates at the\r\nRiver Fleet. The prospect then was uninterrupted by houses, and the\r\npeople upon the rising ground could have had an uninterrupted view of\r\nthe performances at the well.\"\r\n\r\nIn the parish there is a vineyard walk, which marks the site of the old\r\nvineyard attached to the priory of St. John. The cultivation of the vine\r\nwas carried on in many monasteries. In 1859, in front of the old\r\nVineyard Inn, a signboard was set up which stated that \"This house is\r\ncelebrated from old associations connected with the City of London.\r\nAfter the City clerks partook of the water of Clerks' Well, from which\r\nthe parish derives its name, they repaired hither to partake of the\r\nfruit of the finest English grapes.\" This was an ingenious contrivance\r\non the part of the landlord to solicit custom. It need hardly be stated\r\nthat the information given on this signboard was incorrect. Before the\r\nReformation there were few inns, and the old Vineyard Inn can scarcely\r\nclaim such a remote ancestry.\r\n\r\nWhen miracle plays ceased to be performed the clerks did not desert\r\ntheir old quarters. It is, indeed, stated that the ancient society of\r\nparish clerks became divided; some turned their attention to wrestling\r\nand mimicry at Bartholomew Fair, whilst others, for their better\r\nadministration, formed themselves into the Society of the Mayor,\r\nAldermen, and Recorder of Stroud Green, assembling in the Old Crown at\r\nIslington; but still \"saving their right to exhibit at the Old London\r\nSpaw, formerly Clerks' Well, when they might happen to have learned\r\nsheriffs and other officers to get up their sacred pieces as usual.\"\r\nEven so late as 1774 the members of this ancient society were accustomed\r\nto meet annually in the summer time at Stroud Green, and to regale\r\nthemselves in the open air, the number of persons assembling on some\r\noccasions producing a scene similar to that of a country wake or fair.\r\nThese assemblies had no connection with the Worshipful Company of\r\nParish Clerks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE CLERKS AND THE PARISH REGISTERS\r\n\r\nA study of an old parish register reveals a remarkable variation in the\r\nstyle and character of the handwriting. We see in the old parchment\r\npages numerous entries recorded in a careless scribble, and others\r\nevidently written by the hand of a learned and careful scholar. The\r\nrector or vicar ever since the days of Henry VIII, when in 1536\r\nVicar-General Thomas Cromwell ordered the keeping of registers, was\r\nusually supposed to have recorded the entries in the register. Cromwell\r\nderived the notion of ordering the keeping of the registers from his\r\nobservation of the records kept by the Spanish priests in the Low\r\nCountries where he resided in his youth. Archbishop Ximenes of Toledo\r\ninstituted a system of registration in Spain in 1497, and this was\r\ncarried on by the Spanish priests in the Netherlands, and thus laid the\r\nfoundation of that system which Thomas Cromwell introduced to this\r\ncountry and which has continued ever since.\r\n\r\nBut not all these entries were made by the incumbents. There is good\r\nevidence that the parish clerks not infrequently kept the registers,\r\nespecially in later times, and from the beginning they were responsible\r\nfor the facts recorded. The entries do not seem to have been made when\r\nthe baptism, marriage, or burial took place. Cromwell's edict required\r\nthat the records of each week should be entered in the register on the\r\nfollowing Sunday, in the presence of the churchwardens. It seems to have\r\nbeen the custom for the clerk or vicar to write down particulars of the\r\nbaptism, marriage, or burial in a private memorandum book or on loose\r\nsheets of paper at the time of the ceremony. Afterwards these rough\r\nnotes were copied into the register book. Sometimes this was done each\r\nweek; but human nature is fallible; the clerk or his master forgot\r\nsometimes to make the required entries in the book. Days and weeks\r\nslipped by; note-books and scraps of paper were mislaid and lost; the\r\nspelling of the clerk was not always his strongest point; hence\r\nmistakes, omissions, inaccuracies were not infrequent. Sometimes the\r\nvicar did not make up his books until a whole year had elapsed. This was\r\nthe case with the poor parson of Carshalton, who was terribly distressed\r\nbecause his clerk would not furnish him with the necessary notes, and\r\nmightily afraid lest he should incur the censure of his parishioners.\r\nHence we find the following note in his register, dated 10 March, 1651:\r\n\r\n     \"Good reader, tread gently:\r\n\r\n     \"For though these vacant years may seem to make me guilty of\r\n     thy censure, neither will I excuse myself from all blemishe;\r\n     yet if thou doe but cast thine eye upon the former pages and\r\n     see with what care I have kept the Annalls of mine owne time,\r\n     and rectifyed sundry errors of former times, thou wilt begin\r\n     to think ther is some reason why he that began to build so\r\n     well should not be able to make an ende.\r\n\r\n     \"The truth is that besyde the miserys and distractions of\r\n     these ptermitted years which it may be God in his owne\r\n     wisdom would not suffer to be kept uppon record, the special\r\n     ground of that permission ought to be imputed to Richard\r\n     Finch, the p'rishe Clarke, whose office it was by long\r\n     pscrition to gather the ephemeris or dyary by the dayly\r\n     passages, and to exhibit them once a year to be transcribed\r\n     into this registry; and though I have often called upon him\r\n     agayne and agayne to remember his chadge, and he always told\r\n     me that he had the accompts lying by him, yet at last\r\n     p'ceaving his excuses, and revolving upon suspicion of his\r\n     words to put him home to a full tryall I found to my great\r\n     griefe that all his accompts were written in sand, and his\r\n     words committed to the empty winds. God is witness to the\r\n     truth of this apologie, and that I made it knowne at some\r\n     parish meetings before his own face, who could not deny it,\r\n     neither do I write it to blemishe him, but to cleere my own\r\n     integritie as far as I may, and to give accompt of this\r\n     miscarryage to after ages by the subscription of my\r\n     hand[62].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: _Social Life as told by Parish Registers_, by T.F.\r\nThiselton-Dyer, p. 57.]\r\n\r\nWe may hope that all clerks were not so neglectful as poor Richard\r\nFinch, whose name is thus handed down as an \"awful example\" to all\r\ncareless clerks. The same practice of the parish clerks recording the\r\nparticulars of weddings, christenings, and burials seems to have\r\nprevailed at St. Stephen's, Coleman Street, London, in 1542, as the\r\nfollowing order shows:\r\n\r\n     \"They shall every week certify to the curate and the\r\n     churchwardens all the names and sir-names of them that be\r\n     wedded, christened, and buried in the same parish that week\r\n     _sub pena_ of a 1 d. to be paid to the churche.\"\r\n\r\nIn this case the curate doubtless entered the items in the register as\r\nthey were delivered to him.\r\n\r\nAt St. Margaret's, Lothbury, the clerk seems to have kept the register\r\nhimself. Amongst the ordinances made by \"the hole consent of the\r\nparrishiners\" in 1571, appears the following:\r\n\r\n     \"Item the Clarcke shall kepe the register of cristeninge\r\n     weddinge and burynge perfectlye, and shall present the same\r\n     everie Sondaie to the churche wardens to be perused by them,\r\n     and shall have for his paines in this behaufe yearelye 0. 03.\r\n     4.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that in some cases in the sixteenth century the clerk kept\r\nthe register. But in far the larger number of parishes the records were\r\ninserted by the vicar or rector, and in many books the records are made\r\nin Latin. The \"clerk's notes\" from which the entries were made are still\r\npreserved in some parishes.\r\n\r\nIn times of laxity and confusion wrought by the Civil War and Puritan\r\npersecution, the clerk would doubtless be the only person capable of\r\nkeeping the registers. In my own parish the earliest book begins in the\r\nyear 1538, and is kept with great accuracy, the entries being written in\r\na neat scholarly hand. As time goes on the writing is still very good,\r\nbut it does not seem to be that of the rector, who signs his name at the\r\nfoot of the page. If it be that of the clerk, he is a very clerkly\r\nclerk. The writing gradually gets worse, especially during the\r\nCommonwealth period; but it is no careless scribble. The clerk evidently\r\ntook pains and fashioned his letters after the model of the old\r\ncourt-hand. An entry appears which tells of the appointment of a Parish\r\nRegistrar, or \"Register\" as he was called. This is the announcement:\r\n\r\n     \"Whereas Robt. Williams of the p ish of Barkham in the County\r\n     of Berks was elected and chosen by the Inhabitants of the\r\n     same P ish to be their p ish Register, he therefore ye sd Ro:\r\n     Wms was approved and sworne this sixteenth day of\r\n     Novemb.. 1653\r\n\r\n     Snd R. Bigg.\"\r\n\r\nJudging from the similarity of the writing immediately above and below\r\nthis entry, I imagine that Robert Williams must have been the old clerk\r\nwho was so beloved by the inhabitants that in an era of change, when the\r\nrector was banished from his parish, they elected him \"Parish Register,\"\r\nand thus preserved in some measure the traditions of the place. The\r\nchildren are now entered as \"borne\" and not baptised as formerly.\r\n\r\nThe writing gradually gets more illiterate and careless, until the\r\nRestoration takes place. A little space is left, and then the entries\r\nare recorded in a scholarly handwriting, evidently the work of the new\r\nrector. Subsequently the register appears to have been usually kept by\r\nthe rector, though occasionally there are lapses and indifferent writing\r\nappears. Sometimes the clerk has evidently supplied the deficiencies of\r\nhis master, recording a burial or a wedding which the rector had\r\nomitted. In later times, when pluralism was general, and this living was\r\nheld in conjunction with three or four other parishes, the rector must\r\nhave been very dependent upon the clerk for information concerning the\r\nfunctions to be recorded. Moreover, when a former rector who was a noted\r\nsportsman and one of the best riders and keenest hunters in the county,\r\nsometimes took a wedding on his way to the meet, he would doubtless be\r\nso eager for the chase that he had little leisure to record the exact\r\ndetails of the names of the \"happy pair,\" and must have trusted much to\r\nthe clerk.\r\n\r\nSome of the private registers kept by clerks are still preserved. There\r\nis one at Pattishall which contains entries of births, marriages, and\r\nburials, and was probably commenced in 1774, that date being on the\r\nfront page together with the inscription: \"John Clark's Register Book.\"\r\nThe writing is of a good round-hand character, and far superior to the\r\ncaligraphy of many present-day clerks. The book is bound in vellum[63].\r\nThe following entry, taken from the end of the volume, is worth\r\nrecording:\r\n\r\n     \"London, March 31th\r\n\r\n     \"Yesterday the Rev'd Mr Hetherington ... transferred. 20,000\r\n     £.

B.W. Blyn-Stoyle, who has\r\nmost kindly assisted me in many ways in discovering quaint records of\r\nold clerks.]\r\n\r\nAmongst the register books of Wednesbury there is a volume bound in\r\nparchment bearing this inscription:\r\n\r\n     \"This Book seems to be the private register of Alexander\r\n     Bunn, Parish Clerk, because it corresponds with another\r\n     bearing the same dates; the private accounts written in this\r\n     book by the said A.

But the\r\nparish clerks sinned grievously. One Phillips, clerk of Lambeth parish,\r\nran away with the register book, so Francis Sadler tells us in his\r\ncurious book, _The Exaction and Imposition of Parish Fees Discovered_,\r\npublished in 1738, \"whereby the parish became great sufferers; and in\r\nsuch a case no person that is fifty years old, and born in the parish,\r\ncan have a transcript of the Register to prove themselves heir to an\r\nestate.\" Moreover, Master Sadler, who was very severe on parish clerks,\r\ntells of the iniquities of the Battersea clerk who used to register boys\r\nfor girls and girls for boys, and not one-half of the register book, in\r\nhis time, was correct and authentic, as it ought to be.\r\n\r\nWhat shall be said of the carelessness of an incumbent who allowed the\r\nregister to be kept by the clerk in his poor cottage? When a gentleman\r\ncalled to obtain an extract from the book, the clerk produced the\r\nvaluable tome from a drawer in an old table, where it was reposing with\r\na mass of rubbish. Another old parchment register was discovered in a\r\ncottage in a Northamptonshire parish, some of the pages of which were\r\ntacked together as a covering for the tester of a bedstead. The clerk in\r\nanother parish followed the calling of a tailor, and found the old\r\nregister book useful for the purpose of providing himself with measures.\r\nWith this object he cut out sixteen leaves of the old book, which he\r\nregarded in the light of waste paper.\r\n\r\nA gentleman on one occasion visited a church in order to examine the\r\nregisters of an Essex parish. He found the record for which he was\r\nsearching, and asked the clerk to make the extract for him.\r\nUnfortunately this official had no ink or paper at hand with which to\r\ncopy out the entry, and casually observed:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you may as well have the leaf as it is,\" and without any hesitation\r\ntook out his pocket-knife, cut out the leaf and gave the gentleman the\r\ntwo entire pages[65].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: _History of Parish Registers_, by Burn; _Social Life as\r\ntold by Parish Registers_, by T.F. Thiselton-Dyer, p. 2.]\r\n\r\nAnother scandalous case was that of the clerk who combined his\r\necclesiastical duties with those of the village grocer. The pages of the\r\nparish register he found most useful for wrapping up his goods for his\r\ncustomers. He was, however, no worse than the curate's wife, who ought\r\nto have known better, and who used the leaves of the registers for\r\nmaking her husband's kettle-holders.\r\n\r\nWhat shall be said for the guardians of the church documents of\r\nBlythburgh, Suffolk? The parish chest preserved in the church was at one\r\ntime full of valuable documents in addition to very complete registers.\r\nSo Suckling, the historian of Suffolk, reported. Alas! these have\r\nnearly all disappeared. Scarcely anything remains of the earliest volume\r\nof the register which concludes with the end of the seventeenth century,\r\nand the old deeds have gone also. How could this terrible loss have\r\noccurred? It appears that a parish clerk, \"in showing this fine old\r\nchurch to visitors, presented those curious in old papers and autographs\r\nwith a leaf from the register, or some other document, as a memento of\r\ntheir visit[66].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: _Social Life as told by Parish Registers_; also\r\n_Standard_, 8 Jan., 1880.]\r\n\r\nAnother clerk was extremely popular with the old ladies of the village,\r\nand used to cut out the parchment leaves of the registers and present\r\nthem to his old lady friends for wrapping their knitting pins. He was\r\nalso the village schoolmaster, as many of his predecessors had been, but\r\nthis wretch used to cover the backs of his pupil's lesson-books with\r\nleaves of parchment taken from the parish chest. Another clerk found the\r\nleaves of the registers very useful for \"singeing a goose.\"\r\n\r\nThe value of old registers for proving titles to estates and other\r\nproperty is of course inestimable. Sometimes incomes of thousands of\r\npounds depend upon a little entry in one of these old books, and it is\r\nterrible to think of the jeopardy in which they stand when they rest in\r\nthe custody of a careless clerk or apathetic vicar.\r\n\r\nThe present writer owes much to the faithful care of a good clerk, who\r\nguarded well the registers of a defunct City church of London. My father\r\nwas endeavouring to prove his title to an estate in the north country,\r\nand had to obtain the certificates of the births, deaths, and marriages\r\nof the family during about a century. One wedding could not be proved.\r\nReport stated that it had been a runaway marriage, and that the bride\r\nand bridegroom had fled to London to be married in a City church. My\r\nfather casually heard of the name of some church where it was thought\r\nthat the wedding might have taken place. He wrote to the authorities of\r\nthat church. It had, however, ceased to exist. The church had\r\ndisappeared, but the old clerk was alive and knew where the books were.\r\nHe searched, and found the missing register, and the chain of evidence\r\nwas complete and the title to the property fully established, which was\r\nconfirmed after much troublesome litigation by the Court of Chancery.\r\n\r\nSometimes litigants have sought to remove troublesome entries in those\r\ninvaluable books which record with equal impartiality the entrance into\r\nthe world and the departure from it of peer or peasant. And in such\r\ndramas the clerk frequently appears. The old man has to be bribed or\r\ncajoled to allow the books to be tampered with. A stranger arrives one\r\nevening at Rochester, and demands of the clerk to be shown the\r\nregisters. The stranger finds the entry upon which much depends. In its\r\npresent form it does not support his case. It must be altered in order\r\nto meet his requirements. The clerk hovers about the vestry, alert,\r\nvigilant. He must be got rid of. The stranger proposes various\r\ninducements; the temptation of a comfortable seat in a cosy corner of\r\nthe nearest inn, a stimulating glass, but all in vain. There is\r\nsomething suspicious about the stranger's looks and manners; so the\r\nclerk thinks. He sticks to his elbow like a leech, and nothing can shake\r\nhim off. At length the stranger offers the poor clerk a goodly bribe if\r\nonly he will help him to alter a few words in that all-important\r\nregister. I am not sure whether the clerk yielded to the temptation.\r\n\r\nThere was a still more dramatic scene in the old vestry of Lainston\r\nChurch, where a few years previously a Miss Chudleigh had been married\r\nto Lieutenant Hervey. This young lady, who was not remarkable for her\r\nvirtue, arrived one day at the church accompanied by a fascinating\r\nfriend who, while Mrs. Hervey examined the register, exercised her\r\nblandishments on the clerk. She expressed much interest in the church,\r\nand asked him endless questions about its architecture, the state of his\r\nhealth, his family, his duties; and while this little by-play was\r\nproceeding Mrs. Hervey was carefully and noiselessly cutting out the\r\npage in the register which contained the entry of her marriage. Having\r\nremoved the tell-tale page she hastily closed the book, summoned her\r\nfascinating friend, and hastened back to London. The clerk, still\r\nthinking of the beautiful lady who had been so friendly and given him\r\nsuch a handsome present, locked the safe, and never discovered the\r\ntheft. But time brought its revenge. Lieutenant Hervey succeeded\r\nunexpectedly to the title of the earldom of Bristol. His wife was\r\novercome with remorse. By her foolish scheme she had sacrificed a\r\ncoronet. That missing paper must be restored; and so the lady pays\r\nanother visit to Lainston Church, on this occasion in the company of a\r\nlawyer. The old clerk unlocks again the parish chest. The books are\r\nagain produced; confession is made of the former theft; the lawyer looks\r\nthreateningly at the clerk, and tells him that if it should ever be\r\ndiscovered he will suffer as an accomplice; and then, with the promise\r\nof a substantial bribe, the clerk consents to give his aid. The missing\r\npaper is produced and deftly inserted in its former place in the book,\r\nand Miss Chudleigh becomes the Countess of Bristol. It is a curious\r\nstory, but it has the merit of being true. Many strange romances are\r\nbound up within the stained and battered parchment covers of an\r\nold register.\r\n\r\nSometimes the clerk seems to have recorded in the register book some\r\nentries which scarcely relate to ecclesiastical usages or spiritual\r\nconcerns. Agreements or bargains were inserted occasionally, and the\r\nfact that it was recorded in the church books testified to the binding\r\nnature of the transaction. Thus in the book of St. Mary Magdalene,\r\nCambridge, in the year 1692, it is announced that Thomas Smith promises\r\nto supply John Wingate \"with hatts for twenty shillings the yeare during\r\nlife.\" Mr. Thiselton-Dyer, who records this transaction in his book on\r\n_Social Life as told by Parish Registers_, conjectures with evident\r\ntruth that the aforenamed men made this bargain at an ale-house, and the\r\nparish clerk, being present, undertook to register the agreement.\r\n\r\nA most remarkable clerk lived at Grafton Underwood in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, one Thomas Carley, who was born in that village in 1755, having\r\nno hands and one deformed leg. Notwithstanding that nature seemed to\r\nhave deprived him of all means of manual labour, he rose to the position\r\nof parish schoolmaster and parish clerk. He contrived a pair of leather\r\nrings, into which he thrust the stumps of his arms, which ended at the\r\nelbow, and with the aid of these he held a pen, ruler, knife and fork,\r\netc. The register books of the parish show admirable specimens of his\r\nwonderful writing, and I have in my possession a tracing made by Mr.\r\nWise, of Weekley, from the label fixed inside the cover of one of the\r\nlarge folio Prayer Books which used to be in the Duke of Buccleuch's\r\npew before the church was restored, and were then removed to Boughton\r\nHouse. These books contain many beautifully written papers, chiefly\r\nsupplying lost ones from the Psalms. The writing is simply like\r\ncopper-plate engraving. In the British Museum, amongst the \"additional\r\nMSS.\" is an interleaved edition of Bridge's _History of\r\nNorthamptonshire_, bound in five volumes. In the fourth volume, under\r\nthe account of Grafton Underwood, some particulars have been inserted of\r\nthe life of this extraordinary man, with a water-colour portrait of him\r\ntaken by one of his pupils, E. Bradley. There is also a specimen of his\r\nwriting, the Lord's Prayer inscribed within a circle about the size of a\r\nshilling. There is also in existence \"a mariner's compass,\" most\r\naccurately drawn by him. He died in 1823.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE CLERK AS A POET\r\n\r\nThe parish clerk, skilled in psalmody, has sometimes shown evidences of\r\ntrue poetic feeling. The divine afflatus has occasionally inspired in\r\nhim some fine thoughts and graceful fancies. His race has produced many\r\nwriters of terrible doggerel of the monumental class of poetry; but far\r\nremoved from these there have been some who have composed fine hymns and\r\nsweet verse.\r\n\r\nAn obscure hymn-writer, whose verses have been sung in all parts of the\r\nworld, was Thomas Bilby, parish clerk of St. Mary's Church, Islington,\r\nbetween the years 1842 and 1872. He was the parish schoolmaster also,\r\nand thus maintained the traditions of his office handed down from\r\nmediæval times. Before the days of School Boards it was not unusual for\r\nthe clerk to teach the children of the working classes the three R's and\r\nreligious knowledge, charging a fee of twopence per week for each child.\r\nMrs. Mary Strathern has kindly sent me the following account of the\r\nchurch wherein Thomas Bilby served as clerk, and of the famous hymn\r\nwhich he wrote.\r\n\r\nThe church of St. Mary's, Islington, was not internally a thing of\r\nbeauty. It was square; it had no chancel; the walls were covered with\r\nmonuments and tablets to the praise and glory of departed parishioners.\r\nOn three sides it had a wide gallery, the west end of which contained\r\nthe organ, with the Royal Arms as large as life in front. On either side\r\nbelow the galleries were double rows of high pews, and down the centre\r\npassage a row of open benches for the poor. Between these benches and\r\nthe altar, completely hiding the altar from the congregation, stood a\r\nhuge \"three-decker.\" The pulpit, on a level with the galleries, was\r\nreached by a staircase at the back; below that was \"the reading desk,\"\r\nfrom which the curate said the prayers; and below that again, a smaller\r\ndesk, where, Sunday after Sunday, for thirty years, T. Bilby, parish\r\nclerk and schoolmaster, gave out the hymns, read the notices, and\r\npublished the banns of marriage. He was short and stout; his hair was\r\nwhite; he wore a black gown with deep velvet collar, ornamented with\r\nmany tassels and fringes; and he carried a staff of office.\r\n\r\nIt was a great missionary parish. The vicar, Daniel Wilson, was a son of\r\nthat well-known Daniel Wilson, sometime vicar of Islington, and\r\nafterwards Bishop of Calcutta. The Church Missionary College, where many\r\nyoung missionaries sent out by the Church Missionary Society are\r\ntrained, stood in our midst; and it was within St. Mary's Church the\r\nwriter saw the venerable Bishop Crowther, of the Niger, ordain his own\r\nson deacon. Mr. Bilby had at one time been a catechist and schoolmaster\r\nin Sierra Leone, and was full of interesting stories of the mission work\r\namongst the freed slaves in that settlement. He had a magic lantern,\r\nwith many views of Africa, and of the churches and schools in the\r\nmission fields, and often gave missionary lectures to the school\r\nchildren. It was on one of these occasions, when he had been telling us\r\nabout his work abroad, and how he soon got to know when a black boy had\r\na dirty face, that he said: \"While I was in Africa, I composed a hymn,\r\nand taught the black children to sing it; and now there is not a\r\nChristian school in any part of the world where my hymn is not known and\r\nsung. I will begin it now, and you will all sing it with me.\" Then the\r\nold man began:\r\n\r\n     \"Here we suffer grief and pain.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately every child in the room took it up, and sang with might and\r\nmain:\r\n\r\n     \"Here we meet to part again;\r\n     In heaven we part no more.\"\r\n\r\nWe had always thought the familiar words were as old as the Bible\r\nitself, and could scarcely believe they had been written by our own\r\nold friend.\r\n\r\nSoon after that memorable night, the old man began to get feeble; his\r\nplace in the church and schools was frequently filled by \"Young Bilby,\"\r\nas he was familiarly called; and in 1872, aged seventy-eight, the old\r\nparish clerk was gathered to his fathers, and his son reigned in\r\nhis stead.\r\n\r\nThe other day a copy of a Presbyterian hymn-book found its way into my\r\nhouse, and there I found \"Here we suffer grief and pain.\" I turned up\r\nthe index which gives the names of authors, wondering if the compilers\r\nknew anything of the source from whence it came, and found the name\r\n\"Bilby\"; but who \"Bilby\" was, and where he lived, is known to very few\r\noutside the parish, where the name is a household word, for Mr. Bilby's\r\nson is still the parish clerk of St. Mary, Islington, and through him we\r\nlearn that his father composed the _tune_ as well as the words of \"Here\r\nwe suffer grief and pain.\"\r\n\r\nAs the hymn is not included in _Hymns Ancient and Modern_ or some other\r\nwell-known collection, perhaps it will be well to print the first two\r\nverses. It is published in John Curwen's _The Child's Own Hymn Book_:\r\n\r\n     \"Here we suffer grief and pain;\r\n     Here we meet to part again:\r\n     In heaven we part no more.\r\n\r\n         O! that will be joyful,\r\n         Joyful, joyful, joyful,\r\n         O! that will be joyful!\r\n         When we meet to part no more!\r\n\r\n     \"All who love the Lord below,\r\n     When they die to heaven will go,\r\n     And sing with saints above.\r\n         O! that,\" etc.\r\n\r\nA poet of a different school was Robert Story, schoolmaster and parish\r\nclerk of Gargrave, Yorkshire. He was born at Wark, Northumberland, in\r\n1795, but migrated to Gargrave in 1820, where he remained twenty years.\r\nThen he obtained the situation of a clerk in the Audit Office, Somerset\r\nHouse, at a salary of £90 a year, which he held till his death in 1860.\r\nHis volume of poems, entitled _Songs and Lyrical Poems_, contains some\r\ncharming verse. He wrote a pathetic poem on the death of the son of a\r\ngentleman at Malham, killed while bird-nesting on the rocks of Cam Scar.\r\nAnother poem, _The Danish Camp_, tells of the visit of King Alfred to\r\nthe stronghold of his foes, and has some pretty lines. \"O, love has a\r\nfavourite scene for roaming,\" is a tender little poem. The following\r\nexample of his verse is of a humorous and festive type. It is taken from\r\na volume of his productions, entitled _The Magic Fountain, and Other\r\nPoems_, published in 1829:\r\n\r\n     \"Learn next that I am parish clerk:\r\n     A noble office, by St. Mark!\r\n     It brings me in six guineas clear,\r\n     Besides _et cæteras_ every year.\r\n     I waive my Sunday duty, when\r\n     I give the solemn deep Amen;\r\n     Exalted then to breathe aloud\r\n     The heart-devotion of the crowd.\r\n     But oh, the fun! when Christmas chimes\r\n     Have ushered in the festal times,\r\n     And sent the clerk and sexton round\r\n     To pledge their friends in draughts profound,\r\n     And keep on foot the good old plan,\r\n     As only clerk and sexton can!\r\n     Nor less the sport, when Easter sees\r\n     The daisy spring to deck her leas;\r\n     Then, claim'd as dues by Mother Church,\r\n     I pluck the cackler from the perch;\r\n     Or, in its place, the shilling clasp\r\n     From grumbling dame's slow opening grasp.\r\n     But, Visitation Day! 'tis thine\r\n     Best to deserve my native line.\r\n     Great day! the purest, brightest gem\r\n     That decks the fair year's diadem.\r\n     Grand day! that sees me costless dine\r\n     And costless quaff the rosy wine,\r\n     Till seven churchwardens doubled seem,\r\n     And doubled every taper's gleam;\r\n     And I triumphant over time,\r\n     And over tune, and over rhyme,\r\n     Call'd by the gay convivial throng,\r\n     Lead, in full glee, the choral song!\"\r\n\r\nThe writers of doggerel verses have been numerous. The following is a\r\nsomewhat famous composition which has been kindly sent to me by various\r\ncorrespondents. My father used to tell us the rhymes when we were\r\nchildren, and they have evidently become notorious. The clerk who\r\ncomposed them lived in Somersetshire[67], and when the Lord Bishop of\r\nthe Diocese came to visit his church, he thought that such an occasion\r\nought not to be passed over without a fitting tribute to the\r\ndistinguished prelate. He therefore composed a new and revised version\r\nof Tate and Brady's metrical rendering of Psalm lxvii., and announced\r\nhis production after this manner:\r\n\r\n\"Let us zing to the Praze an' Glory of God part of the zixty-zeventh\r\nZalm; zspeshul varshun zspesh'ly 'dapted vur t'cazshun.\r\n\r\n     \"W'y 'op ye zo ye little 'ills?\r\n       And what var du 'ee zskip?\r\n     Is it a'cause ter prach too we\r\n       Is cum'd me Lord Biship?\r\n\r\n     \"W'y zskip ye zo ye little 'ills?\r\n       An' whot var du 'ee 'op?\r\n     Is it a'cause to prach too we\r\n       Is cum'd me Lord Bishop?\r\n\r\n     \"Then let us awl arize an' zing,\r\n       An' let us awl stric up,\r\n     An' zing a glawrious zong uv praze;\r\n       An' bless me Lord Bishup.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: Another correspondent states that the incident occurred at\r\nBradford-on-Avon in 1806. Mr. Francis Bevan remembers hearing a similar\r\nversion at Dover about sixty years ago. Can it be that these various\r\nclerks were plagiarists?]\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar effusion was composed by Eldad Holland, parish clerk\r\nof Christ Church, Kilbrogan parish, Bandon, County Cork, in Ireland.\r\nThis church was built in 1610, and has the reputation of being the first\r\nedifice erected in Ireland for the use of the Church of Ireland after\r\nthe Reformation. Bandon was originally colonised by English settlers in\r\nthe reign of Queen Elizabeth, and for a long time was a noted stronghold\r\nof Protestantism. This fact may throw light upon the opinions and\r\nsentiments of Master Holland, an original character, whose tombstone\r\nrecords that \"he departed this life ye 29th day of 7ber 1722.\" When the\r\nnews of the victory of William III reached Bandon there were great\r\nrejoicings, and Eldad paraphrased a portion of the morning service in\r\nhonour of the occasion. After the first lesson he gave out the\r\nfollowing notice:\r\n\r\n\"Let us sing to the praise and glory of William, a psalm of my own\r\ncomposing:\r\n\r\n     \"William is come home, come home,\r\n       William home is come,\r\n     And now let us in his praise\r\n       Sing a _Te Deum_.\"\r\n\r\nHe then continued: \"We praise thee, O William! we acknowledge thee to be\r\nour king!\" adding with an impressive shake of the head, \"And faith, a\r\ngood right we have, for it was he who saved us from brass money, wooden\r\nshoes and Popery.\" He then resumed the old version, and reverently\r\ncontinued it to the end[68].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: This information was kindly sent to me by Mr. Robert\r\nClarke, of Castle Eden, Durham, who states that he derived the\r\ninformation from _The History of Bandon_, by George Bennett (1869). My\r\nfather used to repeat the following version:\r\n\r\n     \"King William is come home,\r\n     Come home King William is come;\r\n     So let us then together sing\r\n     A hymn that's called _Te D'um_.\"\r\n\r\nI am not sure which version is the better poetry! The latter corresponds\r\nwith the version composed by Wesley's clerk at Epworth, old John; so\r\nClarke in his memoirs of the Wesley family records.]\r\n\r\nIn a parish in North Devon[69] there was a poetical clerk who had great\r\nreverence for Bishop Henry Phillpotts, and on giving out the hymn he\r\nproclaimed his regard in this form: \"Let us sing to the glory of God,\r\nand of the Lord Bishop of Exeter.\" On one occasion his lordship held a\r\nconfirmation in the church on 5 November, when it is said the clerk\r\ngave out the Psalm in the usual way, adding, \"in a stave of my own\r\ncomposing\":\r\n\r\n     \"This is the day that was the night\r\n       When the Papists did conspire\r\n     To blow up the King and Parliament House\r\n       With Gundy-powdy-ire.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: My kind correspondent, the Rev. J.B. Hughes, abstains from\r\nmentioning the name of the parish.]\r\n\r\nMy informant cannot vouch for the truth of this story, but he can for\r\nthe fact that when Bishop Phillpotts on another occasion visited the\r\nchurch his lordship was surprised to hear the clerk give out at the end\r\nof the service, \"Let us sing in honour of his lordship, 'God save the\r\nKing.'\" The bishop rose somewhat hastily, saying to his chaplain, \"Come\r\nalong, Barnes; we shall have 'Rule, Britannia!' next.\"\r\n\r\nCuthbert Bede tells the story of a poetical clerk who was much aggrieved\r\nbecause some disagreeable and naughty folk had maliciously damaged his\r\ngarden fence. On the next Sunday he gave out \"a stave of his own\r\ncomposing\":\r\n\r\n     \"Oh, Lord, how doth the wicked man;\r\n       They increases more and more;\r\n     They break the posts, likewise the rails\r\n       Around this poor clerk's door.\"\r\n\r\nHe almost deserved his fate for barbarously mutilating a metrical Psalm,\r\nand was evidently a proper victim of poetical justice.\r\n\r\nA Devonshire clerk wrote the following noble effort:--\r\n\r\n     \"Mount Edgcumbe is a pleasant place\r\n     Right o'er agenst the Ham-o-aze,\r\n     Where ships do ride at anchor,\r\n     To guard us agin our foes. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nBesides writing \"hymns of his own composing,\" the parish clerk often\r\nused to give vent to his poetical talents in the production of epitaphs.\r\nThe occupation of writing epitaphs must have been a lucrative one, and\r\nthe effusions recording the numerous virtues of the deceased are quaint\r\nand curious. Well might a modern English child ask her mother after\r\nhearing these records read to her, \"Where were all the bad people\r\nburied?\" Learned scholars and abbots applied their talents to the\r\nproduction of the Latin verses inscribed on old brass memorials of the\r\ndead, and clever ladies like Dame Elizabeth Hobby sometimes wrote them\r\nand appended their names to their compositions. In later times this task\r\nseems to have been often undertaken by the parish clerk with not\r\naltogether satisfactory results, though incumbents and great poets,\r\namong whom may be enumerated Pope and Byron, sometimes wrote memorials\r\nof their friends. But the clerk was usually responsible for these\r\ninscriptions. Master John Hopkins, clerk at one of the churches at\r\nSalisbury at the end of the eighteenth century, issued an advertisement\r\nof his various accomplishments which ran thus:\r\n\r\n     \"John Hopkins, parish clerk and undertaker, sells epitaphs of\r\n     all sorts and prices. Shaves neat, and plays the bassoon.\r\n     Teeth drawn, and the Salisbury Journal read gratis every\r\n     Sunday morning at eight. A school for psalmody every Thursday\r\n     evening, when my son, born blind, will play the fiddle.\r\n     Specimen epitaph on my wife:\r\n\r\n     My wife ten years, not much to my ease,\r\n     But now she is dead, in cælo quies.\r\n\r\n     Great variety to be seen within. Your humble servant, John\r\n     Hopkins.\"\r\n\r\nPoor David Diggs, the hero of Hewett's story of _The Parish Clerk_, used\r\nto write epitaphs in strange and curious English. Just before his death\r\nhe put a small piece of paper into the hands of the clergyman of the\r\nparish, and whispered a request that its contents might be attended to.\r\nWhen the clergyman afterwards read the paper he found the following\r\nepitaph, which was duly inscribed on the clerk's grave:\r\n\r\n     \"Reader Don't stop nor shed no tears\r\n     For I was parish clerk For 60 years;\r\n     If I lived on I could not now as Then\r\n     Say to the Parson's Prases A loud Amen.\"\r\n\r\nA very worthy poetical clerk was John Bennet, shoemaker, of Woodstock. A\r\nlong account of him appears in the _Lives of Illustrious Shoemakers_,\r\nwritten by W.E. Winks. He inherited the office of parish clerk from his\r\nfather, and with it some degree of musical taste. In the preface to his\r\npoems he wrote: \"Witness my early acquaintance with the pious strains of\r\nSternhold and Hopkins, under that melodious psalmodist my honoured\r\nFather, and your approved Parish Clerk.\" This is addressed to the Rev.\r\nThomas Warton, Professor of Poetry at Oxford, and sometime curate of\r\nWoodstock, to whose patronage and ready aid John Bennet was greatly\r\nindebted. Southey, who succeeded Warton in the Professorship, wrote that\r\n\"This Woodstock shoemaker was chiefly indebted for the patronage which\r\nhe received to Thomas Warton's good nature; for my predecessor was the\r\nbest-hearted man that ever wore a great wig.\" Certainly the list of\r\nsubscribers printed at the beginning of his early work is amazingly\r\nlong. Noblemen, squires, parsons, great ladies, all rushed to secure the\r\ncobbler-clerk's poems, which were published in 1774. The poems consist\r\nmainly of simple rhymes or rustic themes, and are not without merit or\r\nhumour. He is very modest and humble about his poetical powers, and\r\ntells that his reason for publishing his verses was \"to enable the\r\nauthor to rear an infant offspring and to drive away all anxious\r\nsolicitude from the breast of a most amiable wife.\" His humour is shown\r\nin the conclusion of his Dedication, where he wrote:\r\n\r\n\"I had proceeded thus far when I was called to measure a gentleman of a\r\ncertain college for a pair of fashionable boots, and the gentleman\r\nhaving insisted on a perusal of what I was writing, told me that a\r\ndedication should be as laconic as the boots he had employed me to make;\r\nand then, taking up my pen, added this scrap of Latin for a Heel-piece,\r\nas he called it, to my Dedication:\r\n\r\n     \"_Jam satis est; ne me Crispini scrinia lippi\r\n     Compilasse putes, vertum non amplius_.\"\r\n\r\nThe cobbler poet concludes his verses with the humorous lines:\r\n\r\n     \"So may our cobler rise by friendly aid,\r\n     Be happy and successful in his trade;\r\n     His awl and pen with readiness be found,\r\n     To make or keep our understandings sound.\"\r\n\r\nLater in life John Bennet published another volume, entitled\r\n_Redemption_. It was dedicated to Dr. Mavor, rector of Woodstock. It is\r\na noble poem, far exceeding in merit his first essay, and it is a\r\nremarkable and wonderful composition for a self-taught village\r\nshoemaker. The author-clerk died and was buried at Woodstock in 1803.\r\n\r\nA fine character and graceful poet was Richard Furness[70], parish clerk\r\nof Dore, five miles from Shalfield, a secluded hamlet. He was then\r\nstyled \"The Poet of the Peak,\" of sonorous voice and clear of speech,\r\nthe author of many poems, and factotum supreme of the village and\r\nneighbourhood. Two volumes of his poems have been published. He\r\ncombined, like many of his order, the office of parish clerk with that\r\nof schoolmaster, his schoolroom being under the same roof as his house.\r\nThither crowds flocked. He was an immense favourite. The teacher of\r\nchildren, healer of all the lame and sick folk, the consoler and adviser\r\nof the troubled, he played an important part in the village life. His\r\naccomplishments were numerous. He could make a will, survey or convey an\r\nestate, reduce a dislocation, perform the functions of a parish clerk,\r\nlead a choir, and write an ode. This remarkable man was born at Eyam in\r\n1791, the village so famous for the story of its plague, in an old house\r\nlong held by his family. Over the door is carved:\r\n\r\n     R. 1615. F\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: _Biographical Sketches of Remarkable People_, by Spencer\r\nT. Hall.]\r\n\r\nWhen a boy he was very fond of reading, and studied mathematics and\r\npoetry. _Don Quixote_ was his favourite romance. His father would not\r\nallow him to read at night, but the student could not be prevented from\r\nstudying his beloved books. In order to prevent the light in his bedroom\r\nfrom being seen in other parts of the house, he placed a candle in a\r\nlarge box, knelt by its side, and with the lid half closed few rays of\r\nthe glimmering taper could reach the window or door. When he grew to be\r\na man he migrated to Dore, and there set up a school, and began that\r\nactive life of which an admirable account is given by Dr. G. Calvert\r\nHolland in the introduction of _The Poetical Works of Richard Furness_,\r\npublished in 1858. In addition to other duties he sometimes discharged\r\nclerical functions. The vicar of the parish of Dore, Mr. Parker, was\r\nsomewhat old and infirm, and sometimes found it difficult to tramp over\r\nthe high moors in winter to privately baptize a sick child. So he often\r\nsent his clerk to perform the duty. On dark and stormy nights Richard\r\nFurness used to tramp over moor and fell, through snow and rain to some\r\nlonely farm or moorland cottage in order to baptize some suffering\r\ninfant. On one occasion he omitted to ascertain before commencing the\r\nservice whether the child was a boy or a girl. Turning to the father in\r\nthe midst of a prayer, when the question whether he ought to use _his_\r\nor _her_ had to be decided, he inquired, \"What sex?\" The father, an\r\nignorant labourer, did not understand the meaning of the question. \"Male\r\nor female?\" asked the clerk. Still the father did not comprehend. At\r\nlast the meaning of the query dawned upon his rustic intelligence, and\r\nhe whispered, \"It's a mon childt.\"\r\n\r\nThus does Richard Furness in his poems describe his many duties:\r\n\r\n     \"I Richard Furness, schoolmaster, Dore,\r\n     Keep parish books and pay the poor;\r\n     Draw plans for buildings and indite\r\n     Letters for those who cannot write;\r\n     Make wills and recommend a proctor;\r\n     Cure wounds, let blood with any doctor;\r\n     Draw teeth, sing psalms, the hautboy play\r\n     At chapel on each holy day;\r\n     Paint sign-boards, cast names at command,\r\n     Survey and plot estates of land:\r\n     Collect at Easter, one in ten,\r\n     And on the Sunday say Amen.\"\r\n\r\nHe wrote a poem entitled _Medicus Magus, or the Astrologer_, a droll\r\nstory brimming over with quiet humour, folk-lore, philology and archaic\r\nlore. Also _The Ragbag_, which is dedicated to \"John Bull, Esq.\" The\r\nstyle of his poetry was Johnsonian, or after the manner of Erasmus\r\nDarwin, a bard whom the present generation has forgotten, but whose\r\n_Botanic Garden_, published in 1825, is full of quaint plant-lore and\r\nclassical allusions, if it does not reach the highest form of poetic\r\ntalent. Here is a poem by our clerkly poet on the Old Year's funeral:\r\n\r\n     \"The clock in oblivion's mouldering tower\r\n     By the raven's nest struck the midnight hour,\r\n     And the ghosts of the seasons wept over the bier\r\n     Of Old Time's last son--the departing year.\r\n\r\n     \"Spring showered her daisies and dews on his bed,\r\n     Summer covered with roses his shelterless head,\r\n     And as Autumn embalmed his bodiless form,\r\n     Winter wove his snow shroud in his Jacquard of storm;\r\n     For his coffin-plate, charged with a common device,\r\n     Frost figured his arms on a tablet of ice,\r\n     While a ray from the sun in the interim came,\r\n     And daguerreotyped neatly his age, death, and name.\r\n       Then the shadowing months at call\r\n       Stood up to bear the pall,\r\n     And three hundred and sixty-five days in gloom\r\n     Formed a vista that reached from his birth to his tomb.\r\n     And oh, what a progeny followed in tears--\r\n     Hours, minutes, and moments--the children of years!\r\n       Death marshall'd th' array,\r\n       Slowly leading the way,\r\n     With his darts newly fashioned for New Year's Day.\"\r\n\r\nRichard Furness died in 1857, and was buried with his ancestors at Eyam.\r\nHe thus sang his own requiem shortly before he passed away:\r\n\r\n     \"To joys and griefs, to hopes and fears,\r\n       To all pride would, and power could do,\r\n     To sorrow's cup, to pity's tears,\r\n       To mortal life, to death adieu.\"\r\n\r\nI will conclude this chapter on poetical clerks with a sweet carol for\r\nAdvent, written by Mr. Daniel Robinson, ex-parish clerk of Flore,\r\nWeedon, which is worthy of preservation:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CAROL FOR ADVENT\r\n\r\n\"Behold, thy King cometh unto thee.\"--MATTHEW xxi. 5.\r\n\r\n     Behold, thy King is coming\r\n       Upon this earth to reign,\r\n     To take away oppression\r\n       And break the captive's chain;\r\n     Then trim your lamps, ye virgins,\r\n       Your oil of love prepare,\r\n     To meet the coming Bridegroom\r\n       Triumphant in the air.\r\n\r\n     Behold, thy King is coming,\r\n       Hark! 'tis the midnight cry,\r\n     The herald's voice proclaimeth\r\n       The hour is drawing nigh;\r\n     Then go ye forth to meet Him,\r\n       With lamps all burning bright,\r\n     Let sweet hosannahs greet Him,\r\n       And welcome Him aright.\r\n\r\n     Go decorate your churches\r\n       With evergreens and flowers,\r\n     And let the bells' sweet music\r\n       Resound from all your towers;\r\n     And sing your sweetest anthems,\r\n       For lo, your King is nigh,\r\n     While songs of praise are soaring\r\n       O'er vale and mountain high.\r\n\r\n     Let sounds of heavenly music\r\n       From sweet-voiced organs peal,\r\n     While old and young assembling\r\n       Before God's \"Altar\" kneel;\r\n     In humble adoration\r\n       Let each one praise and pray,\r\n     And give the King a welcome\r\n       This coming Christmas Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE CLERK GIVING OUT NOTICES\r\n\r\nAfter the Nicene Creed in the Book of Common Prayer occurs a rubric with\r\nregard to the giving out of notices, the observance of Holy-days or\r\nFeasting-days, the publication of Briefs, Citations and\r\nEx-communications, which ends with the following words:\r\n\r\n\"And nothing shall be proclaimed or published in the Church, during the\r\ntime of Divine Service, but by the Minister; nor by him any thing but\r\nwhat is prescribed in the Rules of this Book, or enjoined by the King or\r\nby the Ordinary of the place.\"\r\n\r\nThis rubric was added to the Prayer Book in the revision of 1662, and\r\ndoubtless was intended to correct the undesirable practice of publishing\r\nall kinds of secular notices during the time of divine service. Dr.\r\nWickham Legg has unearthed an inquiry made in an archidiaconal\r\nvisitation in 1630, relating to the proclamation of lay businesses made\r\nin church, when the following question was asked:\r\n\r\n\"Whether hath your Parish Clerk, or any other in Prayers time, or before\r\nPrayers or Sermon ended, before the people departed, made proclamation\r\nin your church touching any goods strayed away or wanting, or of any\r\nLeet court to be held, or of common-dayes-works to be made, or touching\r\nany other thing which is not merely ecclesiasticall, or a\r\nChurch-businesse?\"\r\n\r\nIn times of Puritan laxity it was natural that notices sacred and\r\nprofane should be indiscriminately mingled, and the rubric mentioned\r\nabove would be sorely needed when church order and a reverent service\r\nwere revived. But in spite of this direction the practice survived of\r\nnot very strictly confining the notices to the concerns of the Church.\r\n\r\nAn aged lady, Mrs. Gill, who is now eighty-four years of age, remembers\r\nthat between the years 1825 and 1835, in a parish church near Welbeck\r\nAbbey, the clerk used to announce the date of the Duke of Rutland's\r\nrent-day. Another correspondent states that after service the clerk used\r\nto take his stand on one of the high flat tombstones and announce sales\r\nby auction, the straying of cattle, etc., and Sir Walter Scott wrote\r\nthat at Hexham cattle-dealers used to carry their business letters to\r\nthe church, \"when after service the clerk was accustomed to read them\r\naloud and answer them according to circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Beresford Hope recollected that in a Surrey town church the notices\r\ngiven out by the clerk included the announcement of the meetings at the\r\nprincipal inn of the town of the executors of a deceased duke.\r\n\r\nIn the days of that extraordinary free-and-easy go-as-you-please style\r\nof service which prevailed at the end of the eighteenth and beginning of\r\nthe nineteenth century, the most extraordinary announcements were\r\nfrequently made by the clerk, and very numerous stories are told of the\r\nlaxity of the times and the quaintness of the remarks of the clerk.\r\n\r\nAn old Shropshire clerk gave out on Easter Day the following\r\nextraordinary notice:\r\n\r\n\"Last Friday was Good Friday, but we've forgotten un; so next Friday\r\nwill be.\"\r\n\r\nAnother clerk gave out a strange notice on Quinquagesima Sunday with\r\nregard to the due observance of Ash Wednesday. He said: \"There will be\r\nno service on Wednesday--'coss why? Mester be going hunting, and so\r\nbeeze I!\" with triumphant emphasis. He is not the only sporting clerk of\r\nwhom history speaks, and in the biographies of some worthies of the\r\nprofession we hope to mention the achievements of a clerkly tailor who\r\ndenied himself every luxury of life in order to save enough money to buy\r\nand keep a horse in order that he might follow the hounds \"like a\r\ngentleman.\"\r\n\r\nSporting parsons have furnished quite a crop of stories with regard to\r\nstrange notices given out by their clerks. Some of them are well known\r\nand have often been repeated; but perhaps it is well that they should\r\nnot be omitted here.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1850 a clerk gave out in his rector's hearing this\r\nnotice: \"There'll be no service next Sunday, as the rector's going out\r\ngrouse-shooting.\"\r\n\r\nA Devonshire hunting parson went to help a neighbouring clergyman in the\r\nold days when all kinds of music made up the village choir.\r\nUnfortunately some difficulty arose in the tuning of the instruments.\r\nThe fiddles and bass-viol would not accord, and the parson grew\r\nimpatient. At last, leaning over the reading-desk and throwing up his\r\narms, he shouted out, \"Hark away, Jack! Hark away, Jack! Tally-ho!\r\nTally-ho![71]\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: _Mumpits and Crumpits_, by Sarah Hewitt, p. 175.]\r\n\r\nAnother clerk caused amusement and consternation in a south-country\r\nparish and roused the rector's wrath. The young rector, who was of a\r\nsporting turn of mind, told him that he wanted to get to Worthing on a\r\nSunday afternoon in time for the races which began on the following day,\r\nand that therefore there would be no service. This was explained to the\r\nclerk in confidence. The rector's horror may be imagined when he heard\r\nhim give out in loud sonorous tones: \"This is to give notice, no suvviss\r\nhere this arternoon, becos measter meyans to get to Worthing to-night to\r\nbe in good toime for reayces to-morrow mornin'.\"\r\n\r\nOld Moody, of Redbourn, Herts, was a typical parish clerk, and his\r\nvicar, Lord Frederick Beauclerk, and the curate, the Rev. W.S. Wade,\r\nwere both hunting parsons of the old school. One Sunday morning Moody\r\nannounced, just before giving out the hymn, that \"the vicar was going on\r\nFriday to the throwing off of the Leicestershire hounds, and could not\r\nreturn home until Monday next week; therefore next Sunday there would\r\nnot be any service in the church on that day.\" Moody was quite one of\r\nthe leading characters of the place, whose words and opinions were law.\r\n\r\nNo one in those days thought of disputing the right or questioning the\r\nconduct of a rector closing the church, and abandoning the accustomed\r\nservices on a Sunday, in order to keep a sporting engagement.\r\n\r\nThat other notice about the fishing parson is well known. The clerk\r\nannounced: \"This is to gi notus, there won't be no surviss here this\r\narternoon becos parson's going fishing in the next parish.\" When he was\r\nremonstrated with after service for giving out such a strange notice,\r\nhe replied:\r\n\r\n\"Parson told I so 'fore church.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely he said officiating--not fishing?\" said his monitor. \"The bishop\r\nwould not be pleased to hear of one of his clergy going fishing on a\r\nSunday afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nThe clerk was not convinced, and made a clever defence, grounded on the\r\nemployment of some of the Apostles. The reader's imagination will supply\r\nthe gist of the argument.\r\n\r\nAnother rector, who had lost his favourite setter, told his clerk to\r\nmake inquiries about it, but was much astonished to hear him give it out\r\nas a notice in church, coupled with the offer of a reward of three\r\npounds if the dog should be restored to his owner.\r\n\r\nThe clerk of the sporting parson was often quite as keen as his master\r\nin following the chase. It was not unusual for rectors to take\r\n\"occasional services,\" weddings or funerals, on the way to a meet,\r\nwearing \"pink\" under their surplices. A wedding was proceeding in a\r\nDevonshire church, and when the happy pair were united and the Psalm was\r\njust about to be said, the clerk called out, \"Please to make 'aste, sir,\r\nor he'll be gone afore you have done.\" The parson nodded and looked\r\ninquiringly at the clerk, who said, \"He's turned into the vuzz bushes\r\ndown in ten acres. Do look sharp, sir[72].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: This story is told by Mrs. Hewett in her _Peasant Speech\r\nof Devon_, but I have ventured to anglicise the broad Devonshire a\r\nlittle, and to suggest that the scene could scarcely have taken place on\r\na Sunday morning, as Mrs. Hewett suggests in her admirable book.]\r\n\r\nThe story is told of a rector who, when walking to church across the\r\nsquire's park during a severe winter, found a partridge apparently\r\nfrozen to death. He placed the poor bird in the voluminous pocket of his\r\ncoat. During the service the warmth of the rector's pocket revived the\r\nbird and thawed it back to life; and when during the sermon the rector\r\npulled out his handkerchief, the revived bird flew vigorously away\r\ntowards the west end of the church. The clerk, who sat in his seat\r\nbelow, was not unaccustomed to the task of beating for the squire's\r\nshooting parties, called out lustily:\r\n\r\n\"It be all right, sir; I've marked him down in the belfry.\"\r\n\r\nThe fame of the Rev. John Russell, the sporting parson of Swymbridge, is\r\nwidespread, and his parish clerk, William Chapple, is also entitled to a\r\nsmall niche beneath the statue of the great man. The curate had left,\r\nand Mr. Russell inserted the following advertisement:\r\n\r\n\"Wanted, a curate for Swymbridge; must be a gentleman of moderate and\r\northodox views.\"\r\n\r\nThe word _orthodox_ rather puzzled the inhabitants of Swymbridge, who\r\nasked Chapple what it meant. The clerk did not know, but was unwilling\r\nto confess such ignorance, and knowing his master's predilections,\r\nreplied, \"I 'spects it be a chap as can ride well to hounds.\"\r\n\r\nThe strangest notice ever given out in church that I ever have heard of,\r\nrelated to a set of false teeth. The story has been told by many.\r\nPerhaps Cuthbert Bede's version is the best. An old rector of a small\r\ncountry parish had been compelled to send to a dentist his set of false\r\nteeth, in order that some repairs might be made. The dentist had\r\nfaithfully promised to send them back \"by Saturday,\" but the Saturday's\r\npost did not bring the box containing the rector's teeth. There was no\r\nSunday post, and the village was nine miles from the post town. The\r\ndentist, it afterwards appeared, had posted the teeth on the Saturday\r\nafternoon with the full conviction that their owner would receive them\r\non Sunday morning in time for service. The old rector bravely tried to\r\ndo that duty which England expects every man to do, more especially if\r\nhe is a parson and if it be Sunday morning; but after he had mumbled\r\nthrough the prayers with equal difficulty and incoherency, he decided\r\nthat it would be advisable to abandon any further attempts to address\r\nhis congregation on that day. While the hymn was being sung he summoned\r\nhis clerk to the vestry, and then said to him, \"It is quite useless for\r\nme to attempt to go on. The fact is, that my dentist has not sent me\r\nback my artificial teeth; and as it is impossible for me to make myself\r\nunderstood, you must tell the congregation that the service is ended for\r\nthis morning, and that there will be no service this afternoon.\" The old\r\nclerk went back to his desk; the singing of the hymn was brought to an\r\nend; and the rector, from his retreat in the vestry, heard the clerk\r\naddress the congregation as follows:\r\n\r\n\"This is to give notice! as there won't be no sarmon, nor no more\r\nservice this mornin', so you'd better all go whum (home); and there\r\nwon't be no sarvice this afternoon, as the rector ain't got his artful\r\nteeth back from the dentist!\"\r\n\r\nThis story so amused George Cruikshank that he wanted to make an\r\nillustration of it. But the journal in which it ought to have appeared\r\nwas very short-lived. Hence Cruikshank's drawing was lost to the world.\r\n\r\nThe clerk is a firm upholder of established custom. \"We will now sing\r\nthe evening hymn,\" said the rector of an East Anglian church in the\r\nsixties. \"No, sir, it's doxology to-night.\" The preacher again said,\r\n\"We'll sing the evening hymn.\" The clerk, however, persisted, \"It's\r\ndoxology to-night\"; and doxology it was, in spite of the\r\nparson's protests.\r\n\r\nIn the days when parish notices with reference to the lost, stolen, or\r\nstrayed animals were read out in church at the commencement of the\r\nservice, the clerk of a church [my informant has forgotten the name of\r\nthe parish] rose in his place and said:\r\n\r\n\"This is to give notice that my Lady ---- has lost her little dog; he\r\ncomes to the name of Shock; he is all white except two patches of black\r\non his sides and he has got--eh?--what?--yes--no--upon my soul he has\r\ngot four eyes!\" It should have been sore eyes, but the long _s_ had\r\nmisled the clerk.\r\n\r\nThe clerk does not always shine as an orator, but a correspondent who\r\nwrites from the Charterhouse can vouch for the following effort of one\r\nwho lived in a village not a hundred miles from Harrow about thirty\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nThere was a tea for the school children, at which the clerk, a farm\r\nlabourer, spoke thus: \"You know, my friends, that if we wants to get a\r\ngood crop of anything we dungs the ground. Now what I say is, if we\r\nwants our youngsters to crop properly, we must see that they are\r\nproperly dunged--- put the larning into them like dung, and they'll do\r\nall right.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject of the Disestablishment of the Church was scarcely\r\ncontemplated by a clerk in the diocese of Peterborough, who, after the\r\namalgamation of two parishes, stated that he was desired by the vicar to\r\nannounce that the services in each parish would be morning and evening\r\nto _all eternity_. It is thought that he meant to say _alternately_.\r\n\r\nI have often referred to the ancient clerkly method of giving out the\r\nhymns. It was a terrible blow to the clerk when the parsons began to\r\ninterfere with his prerogative and give out the hymns themselves. All\r\nclerks did not revenge themselves on the usurpers of their ancient right\r\nas did one of their number, who was very indignant when a strange\r\nclergyman insisted on giving out the hymns himself. In due course he\r\ngave out \"the fifty-third hymn,\" when out popped the old clerk's head\r\nfrom under the red curtains which hung round the gallery, and which gave\r\nhim the appearance of wearing a nightcap, and he shouted, \"That a baint!\r\nA be the varty-zeventh.\"\r\n\r\nThe following account of a notice, which was scarcely authorised, shows\r\nthe homely manners of former days. It was at Sapiston Church, a small\r\nvillage on the Duke of Grafton's estate. The grandfather of the present\r\nDuke was returning from a shooting expedition, and was passing the\r\nchurch on Sunday afternoon while service was going on. The Duke quietly\r\nentered the vestry, and signed to the clerk to come to him. The Duke\r\ngave the man a hare, and told him to put it into the parson's trap, and\r\ngive a complimentary message about it at the end of the service. But the\r\nclerk, knowing his master would be pleased at the little attention,\r\ncould not refrain from delivering both hare and message at once before\r\nthe whole congregation. At the close of the hymn before the sermon he\r\nmarched into a prominent position holding up the gift, and shouted out,\r\n\"His Grace's compliments, and, please sir, he's sent ye a hare.\"\r\n\r\nIn giving out the hymns or Psalms many difficulties of pronunciation\r\nwould often arise. One clerk had many struggles over the line, \"Awed by\r\nThy gracious word.\" He could not manage that tiresome first word, and\r\nalways called it \"a wed.\" The old metrical version of the Psalm, \"Like\r\nas the hart desireth the water-brooks,\" etc. is still with us, and a\r\nbeautiful hymn it is:\r\n\r\n     \"As pants the hart for cooling streams\r\n       When heated in the chase.\"\r\n\r\nA Northumbrian clerk used to give out the words thus:\r\n\r\n     \"As pants the 'art for coolin' streams\r\n       When 'eated in the chaise,\"\r\n\r\nwhich seems to foreshadow the triumph of modern civilisation, the carted\r\ndeer, a mode of stag-hunting that was scarcely contemplated by Tate\r\nand Brady.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nSLEEPY CHURCH AND SLEEPY CLERKS\r\n\r\nThere was a time when the Church of England seemed to be asleep. Perhaps\r\nit may have been that \"tired nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep,\" was\r\nonly preparing her exhausted energies for the unwonted activities of the\r\nlast half-century; or was it the sleep that presaged death? Her enemies\r\ntold her so in plain and unvarnished language. Her friends, too, said\r\nthat she was folding her robes to die with what dignity she could.\r\nLethargy, sloth, sleep--a dead, dull, dreary sleep--fell like a leaden\r\npall upon her spiritual life, darkening the light that shone but vaguely\r\nthrough the storied panes of her mediæval windows, while a paralysing\r\nnumbness crippled her limbs and quenched her activity.\r\n\r\nSuch scenes as Archbishop Benson describes as his early recollection of\r\nUpton, near Droitwich, were not uncommon. The church was aisleless, and\r\nthe middle passage, with high pews on each side, led up to the\r\nchancel-arch, in which was a \"three-decker,\" fifteen feet high. The\r\nclerk wore a wig and immense horn spectacles. He was a shoemaker,\r\ndressed in black, with a white tie. In the gallery sat \"the music\"--a\r\nclarionet, flute, violin, and 'cello. The clerk gave out the \"Twentieth\r\nPsalm of David,\" and the fiddlers tuned for a moment and then played at\r\nonce. Then they struck up, and the clerk, absolutely alone, in a\r\nmajestic voice which swayed up and down without regard to time or tune,\r\nsang it through like the braying of an ass; not a soul else joined in;\r\nthe farmers amused and smiling at each other. Such scenes were\r\nquite usual.\r\n\r\nIn Cornwall affairs were worse. In one church the curate-in-charge had\r\nto be chained to the altar rails while he read the service, as he had a\r\nharmless mania, which made him suddenly flee from the church if his own\r\nactivities were for an instant suspended, as, for example, by a\r\nresponse. The churchwarden, a farmer, kept the padlock-key in his pocket\r\ntill the service was safely over, and then released the imprisoned\r\ncleric. At another Cornish church the vicar's sister used to read the\r\nlessons in a deep bass voice.\r\n\r\nCongregations were often very sparse. Few people attended, and perhaps\r\nnone on weekdays, unless the clerk was in his place. On such occasions\r\nthe parson was tempted to emulate the humour of Dean Swift, who at the\r\nfirst weekday service that he held after his appointment to the living\r\nof Laracor, in the diocese of Meath, after waiting for some time in vain\r\nfor a congregation, began the service, addressing his clerk, \"Dearly\r\nbeloved Roger, the scripture moveth you and me in sundry places,\" etc.\r\n\r\nWhen the Psalms were read, you heard the first verse read in a\r\nmellifluous and cultured voice. Perhaps it was the evening of the\r\ntwenty-eighth day of the month, and you listened to the sacred words of\r\nPsalm cxxxvii., \"By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept, when we\r\nremembered thee, O Sion.\" Then followed a bellow from a raucous throat:\r\n\"Has fur ur 'arp, we 'anged 'em hup hupon the trees that hare thurin.\"\r\nAnd then at the end of the Lord's Prayer, after every one had finished,\r\nthe same voice came drowsily cantering in: \"For hever and hever,\r\nHaymen.\" Sometimes we heard, \"Let us sing to the praise and glory of God\r\nthe 'undred and sixtieth Psalm--_'Ymn 'ooever.\"_ The numbers of the\r\nhymns or Psalms were scored on the two sides of a slate. Sometimes the\r\nfunctionary in the gallery forgot to turn the slate after the first\r\nhymn. \"Let us sing,\" began the clerk--(pause)--\"Turn the slate, will\r\nyou, if you please, Master Scroomes?\" he continued, addressing the\r\nneglectful person.\r\n\r\nThe singing was no mechanical affair of official routine--it was a\r\ndrama. \"As the moment of psalmody approached a slate appeared in front\r\nof the gallery, advertising in bold characters the Psalm about to be\r\nsung. The clerk gave out the Psalm, and then migrated to the gallery,\r\nwhere in company with a bassoon and two key-bugles, a carpenter\r\nunderstood to have an amazing power of singing 'counter,' and two lesser\r\nmusical stars, formed the choir. Hymns were not known. The New Version\r\nwas regarded with melancholy tolerance. 'Sternhold and Hopkins' formed\r\nthe main source of musical tastes. On great occasions the choir sang an\r\nanthem, in which the key-bugles always ran away at a great pace, while\r\nthe bassoon every now and then boomed a flying shot after them.\" It was\r\nall very curious, very quaint, very primitive. The Church was asleep,\r\nand cared not to disturb the relics of old crumbling inefficiency. The\r\nChurch was asleep, the congregation slept, and the clerk often\r\nslept too.\r\n\r\nHogarth's engraving of _The Sleeping Congregation_ is a parable of the\r\nstate of the Church of England in his day. It is a striking picture\r\ntruly. The parson is delivering a long and drowsy discourse on the text:\r\n\"Come unto Me, all ye that labour, and I will give you rest.\" The\r\ncongregation is certainly resting, and the pulpit bears the appropriate\r\nverse: \"I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in\r\nvain.\" The clerk is attired in his cassock and bands, contrives to keep\r\none eye awake during the sermon, and this wakeful eye rests upon a\r\ncomely fat matron, who is fast asleep, and has evidently been meditating\r\n\"on matrimony,\" as her open book declares. A sleepy church, sleepy\r\ncongregation, sleepy times!\r\n\r\nMany stories are told of dull and sleepy clerks.\r\n\r\nA canon of a northern cathedral tells me of one such clerk, whose duty\r\nit was, when the rector finished his sermon, to say \"Amen.\" On a summer\r\nafternoon, this aged official was overtaken with drowsiness, and as soon\r\nas the clergyman had given out his text, slept the sleep of the just.\r\nSermons in former years were remarkable for their length and many\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\nAfter the \"firstly\" was concluded, the preacher paused. The clerk,\r\nsuddenly awaking, thought that the discourse was concluded, and\r\npronounced his usual \"Arummen.\" The congregation rose, and the service\r\ncame to a close. As the gathering dispersed, the squire slipped half a\r\ncrown into the clerk's hand, and whispered: \"Thomas, you managed that\r\nvery well, and deserve a little present. I will give you the same\r\nnext time.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SLEEPING CONGREGATION BY HOGARTH]\r\n\r\nAt Eccleshall, near Sheffield, the clerk, named Thompson, had been, in\r\nthe days of his youth, a good cricketer, and always acted as umpire for\r\nthe village team. One hot Sunday morning, the sermon being very long,\r\nold Thompson fell asleep. His dream was of his favourite game; for when\r\nthe parson finished his discourse and waited for the clerk's \"Amen,\" old\r\nThompson awoke, and, to the amazement of the congregation, shouted out\r\n\"Over!\" After all, he was no worse than the cricketing curate who, after\r\nreading the first lesson, announced: \"Here endeth the first innings.\"\r\n\r\nEvery one has heard of that Irish clerk who used to snore so loudly\r\nduring the sermon that he drowned the parson's voice. The old vicar,\r\nbeing of a good-natured as well as a somewhat humorous turn of mind,\r\ndevised a plan for arousing his lethargic clerk. He provided himself\r\nwith a box of hard peas, and when the well-known snore echoed through\r\nthe church, he quietly dropped one of the peas on the head of the\r\noffender, who was at once aroused to the sense of his duties, and\r\nuttered a loud \"Amen.\"\r\n\r\nThis plan acted admirably for a time, but unfortunately the parson was\r\none day carried away by his eloquence, gesticulated wildly, and dropped\r\nthe whole box of peas on the head of the unfortunate clerk. The result\r\nwas such a strenuous chorus of \"Amens,\" that the laughter of the\r\ncongregation could not be restrained, and the peas were abolished and\r\nconsigned to the limbo of impractical inventions. Possibly the story may\r\nbe an invention too.\r\n\r\nOne of the causes which tended to the unpopularity of the Church was the\r\naccession of George IV to the throne of England. \"Church and King\" were\r\nso closely connected in the mind of the people that the sins of the\r\nmonarch were visited on the former, and deemed to have brought some\r\ndiscredit on it. Moreover, the King by his first act placed the loyal\r\nmembers of the Church in some difficulty, and that was the order to\r\nexpunge the name of the ill-used, if erring, Queen Caroline from the\r\nPrayers for the Royal Family in the Book of Common Prayer.\r\n\r\nOne good clergyman, Dr. Parr, vicar of Hatton, placed an interesting\r\nrecord in his Prayer Book after the required erasure: \"It is my duty as\r\na subject and as an ecclesiastic to read what is prescribed by my\r\nSovereign as head of the Church, but it is not my duty to express my\r\napprobation.\" The sympathy of the people was with the injured Queen, and\r\nthey knew not how much the clergy agreed with them. During the trial\r\npopular excitement ran high. In a Berkshire village the parish clerk\r\n\"improved the occasion\" by giving out in church \"the first, fourth,\r\neleventh, and twelfth verses of the thirty-fifth Psalm\" in Tate and\r\nBrady's New Version:\r\n\r\n     \"False witnesses with forged complaints\r\n       Against my truth combined,\r\n     And to my charge such things they laid\r\n       As I had ne'er designed.\"\r\n\r\nThese words he sang most lustily.\r\n\r\nCowper mentions a similar application of psalmody to political affairs\r\nin his _Task_:\r\n\r\n     \"So in the chapel of old Ely House\r\n     When wandering Charles who meant to be the third,\r\n     Had fled from William, and the news was fresh,\r\n     The simple clerk, but loyal, did announce,\r\n     And eke did rear right merrily, two staves\r\n     Sung to the praise and glory of King George.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not an unusual thing for a parish clerk to select a psalm suited\r\nto the occasion when any special excitement gave him an opportunity.\r\nBranston, the satirist, in his _Art of Politicks_ published in 1729,\r\nalluded to this misapplication of psalmody occasionally made by parish\r\nclerks in the lines:\r\n\r\n     \"Not long since parish clerks with saucy airs\r\n     Apply'd King David's psalms to State affairs.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid this unfortunate habit, a country rector in Devonshire\r\ncompiled in 1725 \"Twenty-six Psalms of Thanksgiving, Praise, Love, and\r\nGlory, for the use of a parish church, with the omission of all the\r\nimprecatory psalms, lest a parish clerk or any other should be whetting\r\nhis spleen, or obliging his spite, when he should be entertaining his\r\ndevotion.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes the clerks ventured to apply the verses of the Psalms to their\r\nown private needs and requirements, so as to convey gentle hints and\r\nsuggestions to the ears of those who could supply their needs. Canon\r\nRidgeway tells of the old clerk of the Church of King Charles the Martyr\r\nat Tunbridge Wells. His name was Jenner. He was a well-known character;\r\nhe used to have a pipe and pitch the tune, and also select the hymns. It\r\nwas commonly said that the congregation always knew when the lodgings in\r\nhis house on Mount Sion were unlet; for when this was the case he was\r\nwont to give out the Psalm:\r\n\r\n     \"Mount Sion is a pleasant place to dwell.\"\r\n\r\nAt Great Yarmouth, until about the year 1850, the parish clerk was\r\nalways invited to the banquets or \"feasts\" given by the corporation of\r\nthe borough; and he was honoured annually with a card of invitation to\r\nthe \"mayor's feast\" on Michaelmas Day. On one occasion the mayor-elect\r\nhad omitted to send a card to the clerk, Mr. David Absolon, who was\r\nclerk from 1811 to 1831, and had been a member of the corporation and\r\ncommon councillor previous to his appointment to his ecclesiastical\r\noffice. On the following Sunday, Master David Absolon reminded his\r\nworship of his remissness by giving out the following verse, directing\r\nhis voice at the same time to the mayor-elect:\r\n\r\n     Let David his accustomed place\r\n       In thy remembrance find.\"\r\n\r\nThe words in Tate and Brady's metrical version of Psalm cxxxii. run\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n     \"Let David, Lord, a constant place\r\n       In Thy remembrance find[73].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: _History of St. Nicholas' Church, Great Yarmouth_, by the\r\npresent Clerk, Mr. Edward J. Lupson, p. 24.]\r\n\r\nIn the same town great excitement used to attend the election of the\r\nmayor on 29 August in each year. Before the election the corporation\r\nattended service in the parish church, and the clerk on these occasions\r\ngave out for singing \"the first two staves of the fifteenth Psalm:\r\n\r\n     \"Lord, who's the happy man,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe passing of the Municipal Act changed the manner and time of the\r\nelection, but it did not take away the interest felt in the event. As\r\nlong as Tate and Brady's version of the Psalms was used in the church,\r\nthat is until the year 1840, these \"two staves\" were annually sung on\r\nthe Sunday preceding the election[74].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: _Ibid._, p. 23.]\r\n\r\nIn these days of reverent worship it seems hardly possible that the\r\nbeautiful expressions in the psalms of praise to Almighty God should\r\never have been prostituted to the baser purposes of private gain or\r\nmunicipal elections.\r\n\r\nSleepy times and sleepy clerks--and yet these were not always sleepy; in\r\nfact, far too lively, riotous, and unruly. At least, so the poor rector\r\nof Hayes found them in the middle of the eighteenth century. Such\r\nconduct in church is scarcely credible as that which was witnessed in\r\nthis not very remote parish church in not very remote times. The\r\nregisters of the parish of Hayes tell the story in plain language. On 18\r\nMarch, 1749, \"the clerk gave out the 100th Psalm, and the singers\r\nimmediately opposed him, and sung the 15th, and bred a disturbance. _The\r\nclerk then ceased_.\" Poor man, what else could he have done, with a\r\ncompany of brawling, bawling singers shouting at him from the gallery!\r\nOn another occasion affairs were worse, the ringers and others\r\ndisturbing the service, from the beginning of the service to the end of\r\nthe sermon, by ringing the bells and going into the gallery to spit\r\nbelow. On another occasion a fellow came into church with a pot of beer\r\nand a pipe, and remained smoking in his pew until the end of the\r\nsermon[75]. _O tempora! O mores!_ as some disconsolate clergymen wrote\r\nin their registers when the depravity of the times was worse than usual.\r\nThe slumbering congregation of Hogarth's picture would have been a\r\ncomfort to the distracted parson.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: _Antiquary_, vol. xviii, p. 65. Quoted in _Social Life as\r\ntold by Parish Registers_, p. 54.]\r\n\r\nTo prevent people from sleeping during the long sermons a special\r\nofficer was appointed, in order to banish slumber when the parson was\r\nlong in preaching. This official was called a sluggard-waker, and was\r\nusually our old friend the parish clerk with a new title. Several\r\npersons, perhaps reflecting in their last moments on all the good advice\r\nwhich they had missed through slumbering during sermon time, have\r\nbequeathed money for the support of an officer who should perambulate\r\nthe church, and call to attention any one who, through sleep, was\r\nmissing the preacher's timely admonition. Richard Dovey, of Farmcote, in\r\n1659 left property at Claverley, Shropshire, with the condition that\r\neight shillings should be paid to, and a room provided for, a poor man,\r\nwho should undertake to awaken sleepers, and to whip out dogs from the\r\nchurch of Claverley during divine service[76].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: _Old English Customs and Curious Bequests_, S.H. Edwards\r\n(1842), p. 220.]\r\n\r\nJohn Rudge, of Trysull, Staffordshire, left a like bequest to a poor man\r\nto go about the parish church of Trysull during sermon to keep people\r\nawake, and to keep dogs out of church[77]. Ten shillings a year is paid\r\nby a tenant of Sir John Bridges, at Chislett, Kent, as a charge on lands\r\ncalled Dog-whipper's Marsh, to a person for keeping order in the church\r\nduring service[78], and from time immemorial an acre of land at\r\nPeterchurch, Herefordshire, was appropriated to the use of a person for\r\nkeeping dogs out of church, such person being appointed by the minister\r\nand churchwardens.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: _Ibid._, p. 221.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: _Ibid._, p. 222.]\r\n\r\nMr. W. Andrews, Librarian of the Hull Institute, has collected in his\r\n_Curiosities of the Church_ much information concerning sluggard-wakers\r\nand dog-whippers. The clerk in one church used a long staff, at one end\r\nof which was a fox's brush for gently arousing a somnolent female, while\r\nat the other end was a knob for a more forcible awakening of a male\r\nsleeper. The Dunchurch sluggard-waker used a stout wand with a fork at\r\nthe end of it. During the sermon he stepped stealthily up and down the\r\nnave and aisles and into the gallery marking down his prey. And no one\r\nresented his forcible awakenings.\r\n\r\nThe sluggard-waker and dog-whipper appear in many old churchwardens'\r\naccount-books. Thus in the accounts of Barton-on-Humber there is an\r\nentry for the year 1740: \"Paid Brocklebank for waking sleepers 2 s. 0.\"\r\nAt Castleton the officer in 1722 received 10 s. 0[79]. The clerk in his\r\ncapacity of dog-whipper had often arduous duties to perform in the old\r\ndale churches of Yorkshire when farmers and shepherds frequently brought\r\ntheir dogs to church. The animals usually lay very quietly beneath their\r\nmasters' seat, but occasionally there would be a scrimmage and fight,\r\nand the clerk's staff was called into play to beat the dogs and\r\nproduce order.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: The reader will find numerous entries relating to this\r\nsubject in the work of Mr. W. Andrews to which I have referred.]\r\n\r\nWhy dogs should have been ruthlessly and relentlessly whipped out of\r\nchurches I can scarcely tell. The Highland shepherd's dog usually lies\r\ncontentedly under his master's seat during a long service, and even an\r\narchbishop's collie, named Watch, used to be very still and well-behaved\r\nduring the daily service, only once being roused to attention and a\r\nstately progress to the lectern by the sound of his master's voice\r\nreading the verse \"I say unto all, Watch.\" But our ancestors made war\r\nagainst dogs entering churches. In mediæval and Elizabethan times such\r\ndoes not seem to have been the case, as one of the duties of the clerks\r\nin those days was to make the church clean from the \"shomeryng of dogs.\"\r\nThe nave of the church was often used for secular purposes, and dogs\r\nfollowed their masters. Mastiffs were sometimes let loose in the church\r\nto guard the treasures, and I believe that I am right in stating that\r\nchancel rails owe their origin to the presence of dogs in churches, and\r\nwere erected to prevent them from entering the sanctuary. Old Scarlett\r\nbears a dog-whip as a badge of his office, and the numerous bequests to\r\ndog-whippers show the importance of the office.\r\n\r\nNor were dogs the only creatures who were accustomed to receive\r\nchastisement in church. The clerk was usually armed with a cane or rod,\r\nand woe betide the luckless child who talked or misbehaved himself\r\nduring service. Frequently during the course of a long sermon the sound\r\nof a cane (the Tottenham clerk had a split cane which made no little\r\nnoise when used vigorously) striking a boy's back was heard and startled\r\na sleepy congregation. It was all quite usual. No one objected, or\r\nthought anything about it, and the sermon proceeded as if nothing had\r\nhappened. Paul Wootton, clerk at Bromham, Wilts, seventy years ago\r\nperformed various duties during the service, taking his part in the\r\ngallery among the performers as bass, flute serpent, an instrument\r\nunknown now, etc., pronouncing his Amen _ore rotundo_ and during the\r\nsermon armed with a long stick sitting among the children to preserve\r\norder. If any one of the small creatures felt that _opere in longo fas\r\nest obrepere somnum_, the long stick fell with unerring whack upon the\r\nurchin's head. When Mr. Stracey Clitherow went to his first curacy at\r\nSkeyton, Norfolk, in 1845, he found the clerk sweeping the whole chancel\r\nclear of snow which had fallen through the roof. The font was of wood\r\npainted orange and red. The singers sat within the altar rails with a\r\ndesk for their books inside the rails. There was a famous old clerk,\r\nnamed Bird, who died only a year or two ago, aged ninety, and, as Mr.\r\nClitherow informed Bishop Stanley, was the best man in the parish, and\r\nwas well worthy of that character.\r\n\r\nEven in London churches unfortunate events happened, and somnolent\r\nclerks were not confined to the country. A correspondent remembers that\r\nin 1860, when St. Martin's-in-the-Fields was closed for the purpose of\r\nredecorating, his family migrated to St. Matthew's Chapel, Spring\r\nGardens (recently demolished), where one hot Sunday evening one of the\r\ncurates of St. Martin's was preaching, and in the course of his sermon\r\nsaid that it was the duty of the laity to pray that God would \"endue His\r\nministers with righteousness.\" The clerk was at the moment sound asleep,\r\nbut suddenly aroused by the familiar words, which acted like a bugle\r\ncall to a slumbering soldier, he at once slid down on the hassock at his\r\nfeet and uttered the response \"And make Thy chosen people joyful.\" My\r\ninformant remarks that the \"chosen people\" who were present became\r\n\"joyful\" to an unseemly degree, in spite of strenuous efforts to\r\nrestrain their feelings.\r\n\r\nSometimes the clerk was not the only sleeper. A tenor soloist of\r\nWednesbury Old Church eighty years ago used to tell the story of the\r\nvicar of Wednesbury, who one very sultry afternoon retired into the\r\nvestry, which was under the western tower, to don his black gown while a\r\nhymn was being sung by the expectant congregation. The hymn having been\r\nsung through, and the preacher not having returned to ascend the pulpit,\r\nthe clerk gave out the last verse again. Still no parson. Then he\r\nstarted the hymn, directing it to be sung all through again; but still\r\nthe vicar returned not. At last in desperation he gave out that they\r\n\"would now sing,\" etc. etc., the 119th Psalm. Mercifully before they had\r\nall sunk back into their seats exhausted the long-lost parson made his\r\nhurried reappearance. The poor old gentleman had dropped into an\r\narm-chair in the vestry, and overcome by the heat had fallen soundly\r\nasleep. As to the clerk, he could not leave his seat to go in search of\r\nhim; there was no precedent for both vicar and clerk to be away from the\r\nthree-decker before the service was brought to a close.\r\n\r\nThe old clerk is usually intensely loyal to the Church and to his\r\nclergyman, but there have been some exceptions. An example of a disloyal\r\nclerk comes from the neighbourhood of Barnstaple.\r\n\r\nA parish clerk, apparently religious and venerable, held his position in\r\na village church in that district for thirty years. He carried out his\r\nduties with regularity and thoroughness equalled only by the parish\r\npriest. This old clerk would frequently make remarks--not altogether\r\npleasing--about Nonconformists, whom he summed up as a lot of \"mithudy\r\nnüzenses\" (methodist nuisances).\r\n\r\nA new rector came and brought with him new ideas. The parish clerk would\r\nnot be required for the future. As soon as the old clerk heard this he\r\nattached himself to a local dissenting body and joined with them to\r\nworship in their small chapel. This, after thirty years' service in the\r\nChurch and a bitter feeling against Nonconformists, is rather\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nIn the forties there was a sleepy clerk at Hampstead, a very portly man,\r\nwho did ample justice to his bright red waistcoat and brass buttons. The\r\nchurch had a model old-time three-decker. The lower deck was occupied by\r\nthe clerk, the upper deck by the reader, and the quarter-deck by the\r\npreacher. The clerk, during the sermon, would often fall asleep and make\r\nknown his state by a snore. Then the reader would tap his bald head with\r\na hymn-book, whereupon he would wake up and startle the congregation by\r\na loud and prolonged \"Ah-men.\"\r\n\r\nWe are accustomed now to have our churches beautifully decorated with\r\nflowers and fruits and holly and evergreens at the great festivals and\r\nharvest thanksgiving services. Sometimes on the latter occasions our\r\ndecorations are perhaps a little too elaborate, and remind one of a\r\nhorticultural show. No such charge could be brought against the\r\nold-fashioned method of church decoration. Christmas was the only season\r\nwhen it was attempted, and sprigs of holly stuck at the corners of the\r\nold square pews in little holes made for the purpose were always deemed\r\nsufficient. This was always the duty of the clerk. Later on, when a\r\ncountry church was found to be elaborately decorated for Christmas and\r\nthe clerk was questioned on the subject, he replied, shaking his head,\r\n\"Ah! we're getting a little High Church now.\" At Langport, Somerset, the\r\npews were similarly adorned on Palm Sunday with sprigs of the catkins\r\nfrom willow trees to represent palms.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned some instances of clerks who were sometimes\r\nelated by the dignity of the office and full of conceit. Wesley enjoyed\r\nthe experience of having a conceited clerk at Epworth, who not only was\r\nproud of his singing and other accomplishments, but also of his personal\r\nappearance. He delighted to wear Wesley's old clerical clothes and\r\nespecially his wig, which was much too big for the insignificant clerk's\r\nhead. John Wesley must have had a sense of humour, though perhaps it\r\nmight have been exhibited in a more appropriate place. However, he was\r\ndetermined to humble his conceited clerk, and said to him one Sunday\r\nmorning, \"John, I shall preach on a particular subject this morning, and\r\nshall choose my own psalm, of which I will give out the first line, and\r\nyou will proceed and repeat the next as usual.\" When the time for\r\npsalmody arrived Wesley gave out, \"Like to an owl in ivy bush,\" and the\r\nclerk immediately responded, \"That rueful thing am I.\" The members of\r\nthe congregation looked up and saw his small head half-buried in his\r\nlarge wig, and could not restrain their smiles. The clerk was mortified\r\nand the rector gratified that he should have been taught a lesson and\r\nlearned to be less vain.\r\n\r\nOld-fashioned ways die hard. Only seven years ago the incumbent of a\r\nsmall Somerset parish found when in the pulpit that he had left his\r\nspectacles at home. Casting a shrewd glance around, he perceived just\r\nbelow him, well within reach, one of his parishioners who was wearing a\r\nlarge pair of what in rustic circles are termed \"barnacles\" tied behind\r\nhis head. Stretching down, the parson plucked them from the astonished\r\nowner's brow, and, fitting them on his clerical nose, proceeded to\r\ndeliver his discourse. Thenceforward the clerk, doubtless fearing for\r\nhis own glasses, never failed to carry to church a second pair wherewith\r\nto supply, if need be, his coadjutor's shortcomings.\r\n\r\nAnother and final story of sleepy manners comes to us from the north\r\ncountry. A short-sighted clergyman of what is known as the \"old school\"\r\nwas preaching one winter afternoon to a slumberous congregation. Dusk\r\nwas falling, the church was badly lighted, and his manuscript difficult\r\nto decipher. He managed to stumble along until he reached a passage\r\nwhich he rendered as follows: \"Enthusiasm, my brethren, enthusiasm in a\r\ngood cause is an excellent--excellent quality, but unless it is tempered\r\nwith judgment, it is apt to lead us--apt to lead us--Here, Thomas,\"\r\nhanding the sermon to the clerk, \"go to the window and see what it is\r\napt to lead us into.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE CLERK IN ART\r\n\r\nThe finest portrait ever painted of a parish clerk is that of Orpin,\r\nclerk of Bradford-on-Avon, Wilts, whose interesting old house still\r\nstands near the grand parish church and the beautiful little Saxon\r\necclesiastical structure. This picture is the work of Thomas\r\nGainsborough, R.A., and is now happily preserved in the National\r\nGallery. Orpin has a fine and noble face upon which the sunlight is\r\nshining through a window as he turns from the Divine Book to see the\r\nglories of the blue sky.\r\n\r\n     \"Some word of life e'en now has met\r\n       His calm benignant eye;\r\n     Some ancient promise breathing yet\r\n       Of immortality.\r\n     Some heart's deep language which the glow\r\n       Of faith unwavering gives;\r\n     And every feature says 'I know\r\n       That my Redeemer lives.'\"\r\n\r\nThe size of this canvas is four feet by three feet two inches. Orpin is\r\nwearing a blue coat, black vest, white neck-cloth, and dark breeches.\r\nHis hair is grey and curly, and falls upon his shoulders. He sits on a\r\ngilt-nailed chair at a round wooden table, on which is a reading-easel,\r\nsupporting a large volume bound in dark green, and labelled \"Bible, Vol.\r\nI.\" The background is warm brown.\r\n\r\nOf this picture a critic states: \"The very noble character of the\r\nworthy old clerk's head was probably an additional inducement to\r\nGainsborough to paint the picture, Seldom does so fine a subject present\r\nitself to the portrait painter, and Gainsborough evidently sought to do\r\njustice to his venerable model by unusual and striking effect of\r\nlighting, and by more than ordinary care in execution. It might almost\r\nseem like impertinence to eulogise such painting, as this canvas\r\ncontains painting which, unlike the works of Reynolds, seems fresh and\r\npure as the day it left the easel; and it would be still more futile to\r\nattempt to define the master's method.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of the portrait is interesting. It was painted at\r\nShockerwick, near Bradford, where Wiltshire, the Bath carrier, lived,\r\nwho loved art so much that he conveyed to London Gainsborough's pictures\r\nfrom the year 1761 to 1774 entirely free of charge. The artist rewarded\r\nhim by presenting him with some of his paintings, _The Return from\r\nHarvest, The Gipsies' Repast_, and probably this portrait of Orpin was\r\none of his gifts. It was sold at Christie's in 1868 by a descendant of\r\nthe art-loving carrier, and purchased for the nation by Mr. Boxall for\r\nthe low sum of £325.\r\n\r\nThe mediæval clerk appears in many ancient manuscripts and\r\nilluminations, which show us, better than words can describe, the actual\r\nduties which he was called upon to perform. The British Museum possesses\r\na number of pontificals and other illustrated manuscripts containing\r\nartistic representations of clerks. We see him accompanying the priest\r\nwho is taking the last sacrament to the sick. He is carrying a taper and\r\na bell, which he is evidently ringing as he goes, its tones asking for\r\nthe prayers of the faithful for the sick man's soul. This picture\r\noccurs in a fourteenth-century MS. [6 E. VI, f. 427], and in the same\r\nMS. we see another illustration of the priest administering the last\r\nsacrament attended by the clerk [6 E. VII, f. 70].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CLERK ATTENDING THE PRIEST AT HOLY BAPTISM]\r\n\r\n[Illustration 2: THE CLERK ATTENDING THE PRIEST AT HOLY BAPTISM]\r\n\r\nAnother illustration shows the priest baptizing an infant which the male\r\nsponsor holds over the font, while the priest pours water over its head\r\nfrom a shallow vessel. The faithful parish clerk stands by the priest.\r\nThis appears in the fifteenth-century MS. Egerton, 2019, f. 135.\r\n\r\nIn the MS. of Froissart's Chronicle there is an illustration of the\r\ncoronation procession of Charles V of France. The clerk goes before the\r\ncross-bearer and the bishop bearing his holy-water vessel and his\r\nsprinkler for the purpose of aspersing the spectators. We have already\r\ngiven two illustrations taken from a fourteenth-century MS. in the\r\nBritish Museum, which depict the clerk, as the _aquæbajalus_, entering\r\nthe lord's house and going first into the kitchen to sprinkle the cook\r\nwith holy water, and then into the hall to perform a like duty to the\r\nlord and lady as they sit at dinner.\r\n\r\nThere is a fine picture in a French pontifical of the fifteenth century,\r\nwhich is in the British Museum (Tiberius, B. VIII, f. 43), of the\r\nanointing and coronation of a king of France. An ecclesiastical\r\nprocession is represented meeting the king and his courtiers at the door\r\nof the cathedral of Rheims, and amongst the dignitaries we see the clerk\r\nbearing the holy-water vessel, the cross-bearer, and the thurifer\r\nswinging his censer. The clerk wears a surplice over a red tunic.\r\n\r\nOne other of these mediæval representations of the clerk's duties may be\r\nmentioned. It is a fifteenth-century French MS. in the British Museum\r\n(Egerton, 2019, f. 142), and represents the last scenes of this mortal\r\nlife. The absolution of the penitent, the administration of the last\r\nsacrament, the woman mourning for her husband and arranging the\r\ngrave-clothes, the singing of the dirige, the burial, and the reception\r\nof the soul of the departed by our Lord in glory. The clerk appears in\r\nseveral of these scenes. He is kneeling behind the priest in the\r\nadministration of the last sacrament. Robed in surplice and cope he is\r\nchanting the Psalms for the departed, and at the burial he is holding\r\nthe holy-water vessel for the asperging of the corpse.\r\n\r\nThere are several paintings by English artists which represent the\r\nold-fashioned clerk in all his glory in his throne in the lowest seat of\r\nthe \"three-decker.\" Perhaps the most striking is the satirical sketch of\r\nthe pompous eighteenth-century clerk as shown in Hogarth's engraving of\r\n_The Sleeping Congregation_, to which I have already referred. As a\r\ncontrast to Hogarth's _Sleeping Congregation_ we may place Webster's\r\nfamous painting of a village choir, which is thoroughly life-like and\r\ninspiring. The old clerk with enrapt countenance is singing lustily. The\r\nmusicians are performing on the 'cello, clarionet, and hautboy, and the\r\nsingers are chanting very earnestly and very vigorously the strains of\r\nsome familiar melody. The picture is a very exact presentment of an old\r\nvillage choir of the better sort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DUTIES OF A CLERK AT A DEATH AND FUNERAL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD BY W.P. FRITH]\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps such a choir as this that an aged friend remembers in a\r\nremote Cornish village. It was a mixed choir, led by a 'cello, flute,\r\nand clarionet. Tate and Brady's version of the Psalms was used\r\nalternately with a favourite anthem arranged by some of the members.\r\n\"We'll wash our hands,\" the basses led off in stentorian tones. Then the\r\ntenors followed. Then the trebles in shrill voices--\"washed hands.\"\r\nFinally, after a pause, the whole choir shouted triumphantly, \"in\r\ninnocenc_ee_\"; and the congregation bore it, my friend naïvely remarks.\r\nThe orchestra on one occasion struck work. Only the clerk, who played\r\nhis 'cello, remained faithful. To prove his loyalty he appeared as\r\nusual, gave out a hymn of many verses, and sang it through in his clear\r\nbass voice, to the accompaniment of his instrument.\r\n\r\nIt was not an unusual thing for the clerk to be the only chorister in a\r\nvillage church, and then sometimes strange things happened. There was a\r\nfavourite tune which required the first half of one of the lines to be\r\nrepeated thrice. This led to such curious utterances as \"My own sal,\"\r\ncalled out lustily three times, and then finished with \"My own\r\nsalvation's rock to praise.\" The thrice-repeated \"My poor poll\" was no\r\nless striking, but it was only a prelude to \"My poor polluted heart.\" A\r\nchorus of women and girls in the west gallery sang lustily, \"Oh for a\r\nman,\" _bis, bis_--a pause--\"A mansion in the skies.\" Another clerk sang\r\n\"And in the pie\" three times, supplementing it with \"And in the pious He\r\ndelights.\" Another bade his hearers \"Stir up this stew,\" but he was only\r\nreferring to \"This stupid heart of mine.\" Yet another sang lustily \"Take\r\nThy pill,\" but when the line was completed it was heard to be \"Take Thy\r\npilgrim home.\"\r\n\r\nReturning to the artistic presentment of clerks, there is a fine sketch\r\nof one in Frith's famous painting of the Vicar of Wakefield, whose\r\ngentle manners and loving character as conceived by Goldsmith are\r\nadmirably depicted by the artist. Near the vicar stands the faithful\r\nclerk, a dear old man, who is scarcely less reverend than his vicar.\r\n\r\nThere is an old print of a portion of the church of St. Margaret,\r\nWestminster, which shows the Carolian \"three-decker,\" a very elaborate\r\nstructure, crowned by a huge sounding-board. The clergyman is\r\nofficiating in the reading desk, and a very nice-looking old clerk, clad\r\nin his black gown with bands, sits below. There is a pompous beadle with\r\nhis flowing wig and a mace in an adjoining pew, and some members of the\r\ncongregation appear at the foot of the \"three-decker,\" and in the\r\ngallery. It is a very correct representation of the better sort of\r\nold-fashioned service.\r\n\r\nThe hall of the Parish Clerks' Company possesses several portraits of\r\ndistinguished members of the profession, which have already been\r\nmentioned in the chapter relating to the history of the fraternity. By\r\nthe courtesy of the company we are enabled to reproduce some of the\r\npaintings, and to record some of the treasures of art which the\r\nfraternity possesses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration (upside down, by the way): PORTRAIT OF RICHARD HUNT THE\r\nRESTORER OF THE CLERKS' ALMSHOUSES]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nWOMEN AS PARISH CLERKS\r\n\r\nA woman cannot legally be elected to the office of parish clerk, though\r\nshe may be a sexton. There was the famous case of _Olive_ v. _Ingram_\r\n(12 George I) which determined this. One Sarah Bly was elected sexton of\r\nthe parish of St. Botolph without Aldersgate by 169 indisputable votes\r\nand 40 which were given by women who were householders and paid to the\r\nchurch and poor, against 174 indisputable votes and 20 given by women\r\nfor her male rival. Sarah Bly was declared elected, and the Court upheld\r\nthe appointment and decreed that women could vote on such elections.\r\n\r\nCuthbert Bede states that in 1857 there were at least three female\r\nsextons, or \"sextonesses,\" in the City of London, viz.: Mrs. Crook at\r\nSt. Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury; Mrs. E. Worley at St. Laurence,\r\nJewry, King Street; and Mrs. Stapleton at St. Michael's, Wood Street. In\r\n1867 Mrs. Noble was sextoness of St. John the Baptist, Peterborough. The\r\n_Annual Register_ for 1759 mentions an extraordinary centenarian\r\nsextoness:\r\n\r\n     Died, April 30th, Mary Hall, sexton of Bishop Hill, York\r\n     City, aged one hundred and five; she walked about and\r\n     retained her senses till within three days of her death.\r\n\r\nEvidently the duties of her office had not worn out the stalwart old\r\ndame.\r\n\r\nAlthough legally a woman may not perform the duties of a parish clerk,\r\nthere have been numerous instances of female holders of the office. In\r\nthe census returns it is not quite unusual to see the names of women\r\nreturned as parish clerks, and we have many who discharge the duties of\r\nchurchwarden, overseer, rate-collector, and other parochial offices.\r\n\r\nOne Ann Hopps was parish clerk of Linton about the year 1770, but\r\nnothing is known of her by her descendants except her name. Madame\r\nD'Arblay speaks in her diary of that \"poor, wretched, ragged woman, a\r\nfemale clerk\" who showed her the church of Collumpton, Devon. This good\r\nwoman inherited her office from her deceased husband and received the\r\nsalary, but she did not take the clerk's place in the services on\r\nSunday, but paid a man to perform that part of her functions.\r\n\r\nThe parish register of Totteridge tells of the fame of Elizabeth King,\r\nwho was clerk of that place for forty-six years. The following extract\r\ntells its own story:\r\n\r\n     March 2nd, 1802, buried Elizabeth King, widow, for 46 years\r\n     clerk of this parish, in the 91st year of her age, who died\r\n     at Whetstone in the Parish of Finchley, Feb. 24th.\r\n\r\n     N.B.--This old woman, as long as she was able to attend, did\r\n     constantly, and read on the prayer-days, with great strength\r\n     and pleasure to the hearers, though not in the clerk's place;\r\n     the desk being filled on the Sunday by her son-in-law,\r\n     Benjamin Withall, who did his best[80].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: Burn's _History of Parish Registers_, p. 129.]\r\n\r\nUnder the shade of the episcopal palace at Cuddesdon, at Wheatley, near\r\nOxford, about sixty-five years ago, a female clerk, Mrs. Sheddon,\r\nperformed the duties of the office which had been previously discharged\r\nby her husband. At Avington, near Hungerford, Berks, Mrs. Poffley was\r\nparish clerk for a period of twenty-five years at the beginning of the\r\nlast century. About the same time Mary Mountford was parish clerk of\r\nMisterton, near Crewkerne, Somersetshire, for upwards of thirty years. A\r\nfemale clerk was acting at Igburgh, Norfolk, in 1853; and at Sudbrook,\r\nnear Lincoln, in 1830, a woman also officiated and died in the service\r\nof the Church. Nor was the office confined to rural women of the working\r\nclass. Mr. Ellacombe remembered to have seen \"a gentle-woman acting as\r\nparish clerk of some church in London.\"\r\n\r\nThere are doubtless many other instances of women serving as parish\r\nclerks, and one of my correspondents remembers a very remarkable\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nIn the village of Willoughton, Lincolnshire, more than seventy years\r\nago, there lived an old dame named Betty Wells, who officiated as parish\r\nclerk. For many years Betty sat in the lowest compartment of the\r\nthree-decker pulpit, reading the lessons and leading the responses, and,\r\nwith the exception of ringing the church bell, fulfilling all the\r\nduties of clerk.\r\n\r\nBut Betty was also looked upon as a witch, and several stories are told\r\nof how she made things very unpleasant for those who offended her.\r\n\r\nOne day there had been a christening at which Betty had done her share;\r\nbut by some unfortunate oversight she was not invited to the feast which\r\ntook place afterwards. No sooner had the guests seated themselves at the\r\ntable than a great cloud of soot fell down the chimney smothering all\r\nthe good things, so that nothing could be eaten. Then, too late, they\r\nremembered that Betty Wells had not been invited, and perfectly\r\nconfident were they that she had had her revenge by spoiling the feast.\r\n\r\nOne of the farmers let Betty have straw for bedding her pig in return\r\nfor manure. When one of his men came to fetch the manure away, she\r\nthought he had taken too much. So she warned him that he would not go\r\nfar--neither did he, for the cart tipped right over. And that was\r\nBetty again!\r\n\r\nWe know Betty had a husband, for we hear that one evening when he came\r\nhome from his work his wife had ever so many tailors sitting on the\r\ntable all busily stitching. When John came in they vanished.\r\n\r\nA few people still remember Betty Wells, and they shake their heads as\r\nthey say, \"Well, you see, the old woman had a very queer-looking eye,\"\r\ngiving you to understand that it was with that particular eye she worked\r\nall these wonders.\r\n\r\nThe story of Betty Wells has been gleaned from scraps supplied by\r\nvarious old people and collected by Miss Frances A. Hill, of\r\nWilloughton. The unfortunate christening feast took place after the\r\nbaptism of her father, and the story was told to her by an old aunt, now\r\ndead, who was grown up at the time (1830) and could remember it all\r\ndistinctly. The people who told Miss Hill about Betty and her weird\r\nwitch-like ways fully believed in her supernatural powers.\r\n\r\nAnother Betty, whose surname was Finch, was employed at the beginning of\r\nthe last century at Holy Trinity Church, Warrington, as a \"bobber,\" or\r\nsluggard-waker[81]. She was the wife of the clerk, and was well fitted\r\non account of her masculine form to perform this duty which usually fell\r\nto the lot of the parish clerk. She used to perambulate the church armed\r\nwith a long rod, like a fishing-rod, which had a \"bob\" fastened to the\r\nend of it. With this instrument she effectually disturbed the peaceful\r\nslumbers of any one who was overcome with drowsiness. The whole family\r\nof Betty was ecclesiastically employed, as her son used to sing:\r\n\r\n     \"My father's a clerk,\r\n       My sister's a singer,\r\n     My mother's a bobber,\r\n       And I am a ringer.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: W. Andrews, _Curiosities of the Church_, p. 176.]\r\n\r\nOne of my correspondents tells of another female clerk who officiated in\r\na dilapidated old church with a defective roof, and who held an umbrella\r\nover the unfortunate clergyman when he was reading the service, in order\r\nto protect him from the drops of rain that poured down upon him.\r\n\r\nDoubtless in country places there are many other churches where female\r\nclerks have discharged the duties of the office, but history has not, as\r\nfar as I am aware, recorded their names or their services. Perhaps in an\r\nage in which women have taken upon themselves to perform all kinds of\r\nwork and professional duties formerly confined to men alone, we may\r\nexpect an increase in the number of female parish clerks, in spite of\r\nlegal enactments and other absurd restrictions. Since women can be\r\nchurchwardens, and have been so long ago as 1672, sextons, overseers and\r\nregistrars of births, and much else, and even at one time were parish\r\nconstables, it seems that the pleasant duties of a parish clerk might\r\nnot be uncongenial to them, though they be debarred by law from\r\nreceiving the title and rank of the office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nSOME YORKSHIRE CLERKS\r\n\r\nDuring many years of the time that the Rev. John Torre occupied the\r\nrectory of Catwick, Thomas Dixon[82] was associated with him as parish\r\nclerk. He is described as a little man, old-looking for his age, and in\r\nthe later years of his life able to walk only with difficulty. These\r\npeculiarities, however, did not prevent his winning a young woman for\r\nhis wife. Possibly she saw the sterling character of the man, and\r\nadmired and loved him for it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: This account of the clerks Dixon and Fewson was sent by\r\nthe Rev. J. Gaskell Exton, and is published by the permission of the\r\neditor of the _Yorkshire Weekly Post_.]\r\n\r\nDixon was strongly attached to the rector, so much so, that to him\r\nneither the rector nor the things belonging to the rector, whether\r\nanimate or inanimate, could do wrong. He had a watch, and even though it\r\nmight not be one of the best, a watch was no small acquisition to a\r\nworking man of his time. He did not live in the days of the\r\nthree-and-sixpenny marvel, or of the half-crown wonder, now to be found\r\nin the pocket of almost every schoolboy. Dixon's watch was of the kind\r\nworn by the well-known Captain Cuttle, which Dickens describes as being\r\n\"a silver watch, which was so big and so tight in the pocket that it\r\ncame out like a bung\" when its owner drew it from the depths to see the\r\ntime. It must, consequently, have cost many half-crowns, but yet as\r\ntimekeeper it was somewhat of a failure. In this, too, it resembled that\r\nof the famous captain of which its proud possessor, as everybody knows,\r\nused to say, \"Put you back half-an-hour every morning, and about another\r\nquarter towards the afternoon, and you've a watch that can be equalled\r\nby a few and excelled by none.\" Dixon, therefore, when asked the time of\r\nday, was usually obliged to go through an arithmetical calculation\r\nbefore he could reply.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, however, all was different; he then had no hesitation\r\nwhatever in at once declaring the correct time. For every Sunday morning\r\nhe put his watch by the rector's clock, and it mattered not how far the\r\nrector's clock might be fast or slow, what that clock said was the true\r\ntime for Dixon. And though the remonstrances of the parishioners might\r\nbe loud and long, they were all in vain, for according to the rector's\r\nclock he rang the church bells, and so the services commenced. He loved\r\nthe rector, therefore the rector's clock could not be wrong. Evidently\r\nDixon was capable of strong affection, a quality of no mean moral order.\r\n\r\nBefore the enclosure of parishes was common, and their various fields\r\nseparated by hedges or other fences; before, too, the ordnance survey\r\nwith its many calculations was an accomplished fact, much more measuring\r\nof land in connection with work done each year was required than at\r\npresent. It was a necessity, therefore, that each village should have in\r\nor near it a man skilled in the science of calculation. Consequently,\r\nthe acquirement of figures was fostered, and so in the earlier part of\r\nthe nineteenth century almost every parish could produce a man supposed\r\nto be, and who probably was, great in arithmetic. Catwick's calculator\r\nwas Dixon, and he was generally thought by his co-villagers to be as\r\nlearned a one as any other, if not more so.\r\n\r\nHe had, however, a great rival at Long Riston. This was one Richard\r\nFewson, who, like Dixon, was clerk of his parish; but while Dixon was a\r\nshopkeeper Fewson kept the village school.\r\n\r\nFewson's modes of punishing refractory scholars were somewhat peculiar.\r\nEither a culprit was hoisted on the back of another scholar, or made to\r\nstoop till his nose entered a hole in the desk, and when in one or other\r\nof these positions was made to feel the singular sensation caused by a\r\nsound caning on that particular part of his anatomy which it is said\r\n\"nature intends for correction.\" Sometimes, too, an offender was made to\r\nsit in a small basket, to the cross handle of which a rope had been\r\ntied, and by this means he was hoisted to a beam near the roof of the\r\nschool. Here he was compelled to stay for a longer or shorter period,\r\naccording to the offence, knowing that, if he moved to ease his crippled\r\nposition, the basket would tilt and he would fall to the floor.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, with an exceptionally refractory pupil, his mode of\r\npunishment was even more peculiar still. Having told all the girls to\r\nturn their faces to the wall--and not one of them, so my informant, one\r\nof the boys, said, would dare to disobey the order--he chalked the shape\r\nof a grave on the floor of the schoolroom. He then made the boy, an\r\nincorrigible truant, strip off all his clothes, and when he stood\r\ncovered only in nature's dress, told him in solemn tones that he was\r\ngoing to bury him alive and under the floor. One scholar was then sent\r\nfor a pick, and when this was fetched, another was sent for a shovel. By\r\nthe time they were both brought, the truant was in a panic of fear, the\r\nend hoped for. The master then sternly asked the boy if he would play\r\ntruant again, to which the boy quickly answered no. On this, he was\r\nallowed to dress, being assured as he did so that if ever again he\r\nstopped from school without leave he should certainly be buried alive,\r\nand so great was the dread produced, the boy from that time was\r\nregularly found at school.\r\n\r\nIf parents objected to these punishments, they were simply told to take\r\ntheir children from school, which, as Fewson was the only master for\r\nmiles around, he knew they would be loath to do. Fewson taught nearly\r\nall the children of the district whose parents felt it necessary that\r\nthey should have any education. He is said to have turned out good\r\nscholars in the three R's, his curriculum being limited to these\r\nsubjects, with, for an extra fee, mensuration added.\r\n\r\nBut Fewson, if he did not teach it, felt himself to be well up in\r\nastronomy. One summer, an old boy of his told me, he got the\r\nchildren--my informant amongst the number--to collect from their parents\r\nand others for a trip to Hornsea. When the money was all in he\r\ncomplained that the amount was insufficient for a trip, and suggested\r\nthat a telescope he had seen advertised should be bought with the money.\r\nIf this were done, he promised that those who had subscribed should have\r\nthe telescope in turn to look through from Saturday to Monday. The\r\ntelescope was purchased, and each subscriber had it once, and then it\r\nwas no more seen. From that time it became the entire property of the\r\nmaster. The children never again collected for a trip, and small wonder.\r\n\r\nFewson was a good singer and musician generally, so in addition to his\r\noffice as clerk he held the position of choirmaster. At church on\r\nSunday he sat at the west end, the boys of the village sitting behind\r\nhim, and it was part of his duty to see that they behaved themselves\r\ndecorously. Should a boy make any disturbance Fewson's hand fell heavily\r\non the offender's ears, and so sharply that the sound of the blows could\r\nbe heard throughout the church. Such incidents as this were by no means\r\nuncommon in churches in the days when Fewson and Dixon flourished, and\r\nthey were looked upon as nothing extraordinary, for small compunction\r\nwas felt in the punishment of unruly urchins.\r\n\r\nI have been told of another clerk, for instance, who dealt such severe\r\nblows on the heads of boys, who behaved in the least badly, with a by no\r\nmeans small stick, that, like Fewson's, they, too, resounded all over\r\nthe church. This clerk was known as \"Old Crack Skull,\" and there were\r\nmany others who might as appropriately have borne the name.\r\n\r\nAs parish clerk, Fewson attended the Archdeacon's visitation with the\r\nchurchwardens, whose custom it was on each such occasion to spend about\r\n£3 in eating and drinking. On the appointment of a new and reforming\r\nchurchwarden this expenditure was stopped, and for the first time Fewson\r\nreturned to Riston sober. Here he looked at the churchwarden and\r\nsorrowfully said, \"For thirty years I have been to the visitation and\r\nalways got home drunk; Sally will think I haven't been.\" He then turned\r\ninto the public-house, and afterwards reached home in the condition\r\nSally, his wife, would expect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHURCH OF ST. MARGARET, WESTMINSTER]\r\n\r\nInsobriety was the normal condition of Fewson after school hours. It was\r\nhis invariable custom to visit the public-house each evening, where he\r\nalways found a clean pipe and an ounce of tobacco ready for him. Here\r\nhe acted as president of those who forgathered, being by virtue of his\r\nwisdom readily conceded this position. His favourite drink was gin, and\r\nof this he imbibed freely; leaving for home about ten o'clock, which he\r\nfound usually only after many a stumble and sometimes a fall. He,\r\nhowever, managed to save money, with which he built himself a house at\r\nArnold, adorning it, as still to be seen, with the carved heads of\r\nsaints and others, begged from the owners of the various ancient\r\necclesiastical piles of the neighbourhood. He died about seventy years\r\nago, and was buried at Riston.\r\n\r\nBetween Dixon and Fewson there was much friendly strife with regard to\r\nthe solving of hard arithmetical problems. This contest was no mere\r\nprivate matter. It was entered into with great zest by the men of both\r\nthe villages concerned; the Catwickians and the Ristonians each backing\r\ntheir man to win. \"A straw shows which way the wind blows,\" we say, and\r\nherein we may feel a breathing of the Holderness man's love of his clan,\r\nan affection which has done much to develop and to strengthen his\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nDixon was employed by the harvesters and others to measure the land\r\nwhich they had reaped, or on which they had otherwise worked. When the\r\ndifferent measurements had been taken, he, of course, had to find the\r\nresult. For this, he needed no pen, ink, or paper, nor yet a slate and\r\npencil. He made his calculations by a much more economic method than\r\nthese would supply. He sat down in the field he had measured, took off\r\nhis beaver hat, and, using it as a kind of blackboard, with a piece of\r\nchalk worked out the result of his measurements on its crown.\r\n\r\nDixon must have been a man of resources, as are most Holderness men\r\nwhere the saving of money is concerned. I have heard it said that the\r\nspirit of economy has so permeated their character that it has\r\ninfluenced even their speech. \"So saving are they,\" say some, \"that the\r\ndefinite article, _the_, is never used by them in their talk.\" But this\r\nis a libel; another and a truer reason may be found for the omission in\r\ntheir Scandinavian origin.\r\n\r\nAnother parish clerk who held office at a church about five miles from\r\nCatwick, by trade a tailor, was a noted character and remarkable for his\r\nparsimonious habits. He is described as having been a very little man\r\nand of an extremely attenuated appearance. The story of his economy\r\nduring his honeymoon, when the happy pair stayed in some cheap town\r\nlodgings, is not pleasing.\r\n\r\nHis great effort in saving, however, resulted from his sporting\r\nproclivities. Tailor though he was, he conceived a great desire to be a\r\nmighty hunter. So strong did this passion burn within him that he made\r\nup his mind, sooner or later, to hunt, and with the best, in a red coat,\r\ntoo. He therefore began to save with this object in view. Denying\r\nhimself every luxury and most other things which are usually counted\r\nnecessaries, for long he lived, it is said, on half a salt herring a day\r\nwith a little bread or a few vegetables in addition. By doing so, he was\r\nable to put almost all he earned to the furtherance of the purpose of\r\nhis heart. This went on till he had saved £200. Then he felt his day was\r\ncome. He bought a horse, made himself the scarlet coat, and went to the\r\nhunt as he thought a gentleman should. His hunting lasted for two\r\nseasons, when, the money he had saved being spent, he went back to his\r\ntrade, at which he worked as energetically as ever.\r\n\r\nAt the west end of the nave of Catwick Church formerly was erected a\r\ngallery. In this loft, as it was commonly called, the musicians of the\r\nparish sang or played. Various instruments, bassoon, trombone,\r\nvioloncello, cornet, cornopean, and clarionet, flute, fiddle, and\r\nflageolet, or some of their number, were employed, calling to mind the\r\nband of Nebuchadnezzar of old. The noise made in the tuning of the\r\ninstruments to the proper pitch may be readily imagined. Now, the church\r\npossesses an organ, and the choirmen and boys have their places in the\r\nchancel, while the musicians of the parish occupy the front seats of the\r\nnave. This arrangement is eminently suitable for effectually leading the\r\npraises of the people, but not perhaps more so, its noise\r\nnotwithstanding, than the former style; indeed, I am somewhat doubtful\r\nif the new equals the old. The old certainly had the merit of engaging\r\nmost, if not all, the musicians of the village in the worship of\r\nthe church.\r\n\r\nAt the east end of the nave, in the days of the loft, stood a kind of\r\ntriple pulpit, commonly called a three-decker. It was composed of three\r\ncompartments, the second above and behind the first, and the third\r\nsimilarly placed with regard to the second. The lowest, resting on the\r\nfloor, was the place for the clerk, the middle was for the parson when\r\nreading the prayers and Scriptures, and the highest for the parson when\r\npreaching. Such pulpits are now almost as completely things of the past\r\nas the old warships from which, in derision, they got their name. Once\r\nonly have I read the service and preached from a three-decker, and then\r\nthe clerk did not occupy the position assigned to him. Dixon, however,\r\nalways used the little desk at the foot of the Catwick pulpit, and from\r\nit took his share of the service.\r\n\r\nIt was part of his duty, as clerk, to choose and to give out the number\r\nof the hymns. Now Dixon, like Fewson, was a singer, and felt that the\r\nchoir could not get on without the help of his voice in the gallery when\r\nthe hymns were sung. Consequently, he then left his box and went to the\r\nsinging loft; but, to save time, as he marched down the aisle from east\r\nto west, and as he mounted the steps of the gallery, he slowly and\r\nsolemnly announced the number of the hymn and read the lines of the\r\nfirst verse. When the hymn was sung, our bird-like clerk came down again\r\nfrom the heights of the loft and returned to his perch at the base of\r\nthe pulpit.\r\n\r\nNowadays, we should consider such proceedings very unseemly, but it\r\nwould have been thought nothing of in the days of Dixon. Scenes,\r\naccording to our ideas, much more grotesque were then of frequent\r\noccurrence. We have already looked on at least one; here is another\r\nwhich took place in the neighbouring church of Skipsea one Sunday\r\nafternoon some sixty years ago, and in connection with singing. The\r\naccount was given to me by a parishioner of about eighty years of age,\r\nwho was one of the choirmen on the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe leading singer, he said, there being no instrument, started a tune\r\nfor the hymn. It would not fit the words, and he soon came to a full\r\nstop, and choir and congregation with him. At this, one of the\r\ncongregation, in a voice that could be heard the whole church over,\r\ncalled out, \"Give it up, George! Give it up!\" \"No, no,\" said the vicar\r\nin answer, leaning over his desk, \"No, no, George, try again! try\r\nagain!\" George tried again, and again failed. But the vicar still\r\nencouraged him with \"Have another try, George! Have another try! You may\r\nget it yet!\" George tried the third time, and now hit upon a right tune;\r\nand to the general delight the hymn was sung through.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt, in the days of our forefathers the services of the Church\r\nwere conducted with the greatest freedom. But we may not judge those who\r\npreceded us by our own standard, nor yet apart from the time in which\r\nthey lived.\r\n\r\nWhen two young people of Catwick or its neighbourhood feel they can live\r\nno longer without each other, they in local phrase \"put in the banns.\"\r\nThey then, of course, expect to have them published, or again in local\r\nidiom \"thrown over the pulpit.\" On all such occasions, according to a\r\nvery old custom, after the rector had read out the names, with the usual\r\ninjunction following, from the middle compartment of the three-decker,\r\nDixon would rise from his seat below, and slowly and clearly cry out,\r\n\"God speed 'em weel\" (God speed them well). By this pious wish he prayed\r\nfor a blessing on those about to be wed, and in this the congregation\r\njoined, for they responded with Amen.\r\n\r\nDixon was the last of the Catwick clerks to keep this custom. Much more\r\nrecently, however, than the time he held office, members of the\r\ncongregation, usually those seated in the loft, on the publication of\r\nthe banns of some well-known people, have called out the time-honoured\r\nphrase. But it is now heard no more. The custom has gone into a like\r\noblivion to that of the parish clerk himself, once so important a\r\nperson, in his own estimation if in that of no other, both in church and\r\nparish. \"The old order changeth.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Dixon died at Catwick when sixty-seven years of age. He was\r\nburied in the churchyard on January 2, 1833, and by the Rev. John Torre,\r\nthe rector he served so faithfully.\r\n\r\nWhen Sydney Smith went to see the out-of-the-way Yorkshire village of\r\nFoston-le-Clay, to which benefice he had been presented, his arrival\r\noccasioned great excitement. The parish clerk came forward to welcome\r\nhim, a man eighty years of age, with long grey hair, thread-bare coat,\r\ndeep wrinkles, stooping gait, and a crutch stick. He looked at the new\r\nparson for some time from under his grey shaggy eyebrows, and talked,\r\nand showed that age had not quenched the natural shrewdness of the\r\nYorkshireman.\r\n\r\nAt last, after a pause, he said, striking his crutch stick on the\r\nground:\r\n\r\n\"Master Smith, it often stroikes moy moind that folks as come frae\r\nLondon be such fools. But you,\" he added, giving Sydney Smith a nudge\r\nwith his stick, \"I see you be no fool.\" The new vicar was gratified.\r\n\r\nYorkshiremen are keen songsters, and _fortissimo_ is their favourite\r\nnote of expression. \"Straack up a bit, Jock! straack up a bit,\" a\r\nYorkshire parson used to shout to his clerk, when he wanted the Old\r\nHundredth to be sung. Well do I remember a delightful old clerk in the\r\nCraven district, who used to give out the hymn in the accustomed form\r\nwith charming manner. He liked not itinerant choirs, which were not\r\nuncommon forty or fifty years ago, and used to migrate from church to\r\nchurch, and sometimes to chapel, in the district where the members\r\nlived. One of these choirs visited the church where the Rev. ----\r\nMorris was rector, and he was directed to give out the anthem which the\r\nitinerant strangers were prepared to sing. He neither knew nor cared\r\nwhat an anthem was; and he gave the following somewhat confused notice:\r\n\r\n\"Let us sing to the praise and glory of God the fiftieth Psalm, _while\r\nyou folks sing th' anthem_,\" casting a scornful glance at the wandering\r\nmusicians in the opposite gallery.\r\n\r\nMissionary meetings and sermons were somewhat rare in those days, but\r\nthe special preacher for missions, commonly called the deputation, who\r\nperforms for lazy clerics the task of instructing the people about work\r\nin the mission field--a duty which could well be performed by the vicar\r\nhimself--had already begun his itinerant course. The congregation were\r\nwaiting in the churchyard for his arrival, when the old Yorkshire vicar,\r\nmentioned above, said to his clerk, \"Jock, ye maunt let 'em into th'\r\nchurch; the dippitation a'n't coom.\" Presently two clergymen arrived,\r\nwhen the clerk called out, \"Ye maunt gang hoame; t' deppitation's coom.\"\r\nThe old vicar made an excellent chairman, his introductory remarks being\r\nmodels of brevity: \"T' furst deppitation will speak!\" \"T' second\r\ndeppitation will speak!\" after which the clerk lighted some candles in\r\nthe singing gallery, and gave out for an appropriate hymn, \"Vital spark\r\nof heavenly flame.\"\r\n\r\nA writer in _Chambers's Journal_ tells of a curious class of clergymen\r\nwho existed forty years ago, and were known as \"Northern Lights,\" the\r\nlight from a spiritual point of view being somewhat dim and flickering.\r\nThe writer, who was the vicar for twenty-five years of a moorland\r\nparish, tells of several clerks who were associated with these clerics,\r\nand who were as quaint and curious in their ways as their masters[83].\r\nThe village was a hamlet on the edge of the Yorkshire moors, near the\r\nconfines of Derbyshire. Beside the church was a public-house kept by the\r\nparish clerk, Jerry, a dapper little man, who on Sundays and funeral\r\ndays always wore a wig, an old-fashioned tailed coat, black stockings,\r\nand shoes with buckles. His house was known as \"Heaven's Gate,\" where\r\nthe farmers from the neighbouring farms used to drink and stay a week at\r\na time. Jerry used to direct the funerals, make the clerkly responses,\r\nand then provide the funeral party with good cheer at his inn. His\r\ninvitation was always given at the graveside in a high-pitched falsetto\r\nvoice, and the formula ran in these words, and was never varied:\r\n\r\n\"Friends of the corpse is respectfully requested to call at my house,\r\nand partake then and there of such refreshments as is provided\r\nfor them.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: By the kindness of the editor of _Chambers's Journal_ I am\r\npermitted to retell some of the stories of the manners of these clerks\r\nand parsons.]\r\n\r\nMuch intemperance and disorder often followed these funeral feastings.\r\nAn old song long preserved in the district depicts one of these\r\nfunerals, which was by no means a one-day affair, but sometimes lasted\r\nseveral days, during which the drinking went on. The inn was perhaps a\r\nnecessity in this out-of-the-world place, but it was unfortunately a\r\ngreat temptation to the inhabitants, and to the old Northern Light\r\nparson who preceded the vicar whose reminiscences we are recording. Here\r\nin the inn the old parson sat between morning and afternoon service with\r\na long clay pipe in his mouth and a glass of whisky by his side. When\r\nthe bells began to settle and the time of service approached, he would\r\nsend Jerry to the church to see if many people had arrived. When\r\nJerry replied:\r\n\r\n\"There's not many comed yet, Mr. Nowton,\" the parson would say:\r\n\r\n\"Then tell them to ring another peal, Jerry, and just fill up my glass\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nThe communion plate was kept at the inn under Jerry's charge. Three\r\ntimes a year it was used, and the circumstances were disgraceful. Four\r\nbottles of port wine were deemed the proper allowance on communion days,\r\nand after a fractional quantity had been consumed in the church, the\r\nrest was finished by the churchwardens at the inn. One of these\r\nchurchwardens drank himself to death after the communion service. He was\r\na big man with a red face, and was always present when a bear was baited\r\nat the top of the hill above the village. One day the bear escaped and\r\nran on to the moor; everybody scattered in all directions, and several\r\ndogs were killed before the bear was caught.\r\n\r\nThe successor of Jerry as clerk, but not as publican, was a rough,\r\nhonest individual who was called Dick. When excited he had two oaths,\r\n\"By'r Lady!\" and \"By the mass!\" but as he always pronounced this last\r\nword _mess_, it was evident he did not understand the nature of the oath\r\nhe used. He had a rough-and-ready way of doing things, and when handing\r\nout hymn-books during service he used to throw a book up to an applicant\r\nin the gallery to save the trouble of walking up the stairs in proper\r\nfashion. He talked the broadest Yorkshire dialect, and it was not always\r\neasy to understand him. This was particularly the case when, in his\r\ncapacity as clerk, he repeated the responses at the funeral service.\r\n\r\nA tremendous snowfall happened one winter, and the roads were all\r\nblocked. It was impossible for any one to go to church on the Sunday\r\nmorning following the fall, as the snow had not been cleared away. It\r\nwas necessary for the vicar, however, to get there, as he had to read\r\nout the banns of marriage which were being published; so, putting on\r\nfishing-waders to protect himself from the wet snow, he succeeded with\r\nsome difficulty in getting through the drifts. In the churchyard,\r\nstanding before the church clock, he found Dick intently gazing at it,\r\nso he asked him if it was going. His reply was laconic: \"Noa; shoo's\r\nfroz.\" He and the vicar then went into the church, and the necessary\r\npublication of banns was read in the presence of the clerk alone.\r\n\r\nIn those days it was necessary that the wedding service should be all\r\nover by twelve o'clock, and it was most important that due notice should\r\nbe given of the date of the wedding, a matter about which Dick was\r\nsometimes rather careless.\r\n\r\nThe vicar had gone into Derbyshire for a few days to fish the River\r\nDerwent. He was fishing a long distance up the stream when he heard his\r\nname called, and saw his servant running towards him, who said that a\r\nwedding was waiting for him at the church. Dick had forgotten to give\r\ndue notice of this event. The vicarage trap was in readiness, but the\r\nroad over the Derbyshire Peak was rough and steep, the pony small, the\r\ndistance ten miles, and the vicar encumbered with wet clothes. The\r\nchance of getting to the church before twelve o'clock seemed remote. But\r\nthe vicar and pony did their best; it was, however, half an hour after\r\nthe appointed time when they reached the church. Glancing at the clock\r\nin the tower, the vicar, to his astonishment, found the hands pointing\r\nto half-past eleven. The situation was saved, and the service was\r\nconcluded within the prescribed time. The vicar turned to the clerk for\r\nan explanation. \"I seed yer coming over the hill,\" he said, \"and I just\r\nstopped the clock a bit.\" Dick was an ingenious man.\r\n\r\nThere was another character in the parish quite as peculiar as Dick, and\r\nhe was one of the principal singers, who sat in the west gallery. He had\r\nformerly played the clarionet, before an organ was put into the church.\r\nDuring service he always kept a red cotton handkerchief over his bald\r\nhead, which gave him a decidedly comic appearance.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion the clergyman gave out a hymn in the old-fashioned way:\r\n\"Let us sing to the praise and glory of God the twenty-first hymn,\r\nsecond version.\" Up jumped the old singer and shouted, \"You're wrang,\r\nmaister; it's first version.\" The clergyman corrected himself, when the\r\nsinger again rose: \"You're wrang agearn; it's twenty-second hymn.\"\r\nWithout any remark the clergyman corrected the number, and the man again\r\njumped up: \"That's reet, mon, that's reet.\" When the old singer died his\r\nwidow was very anxious there should be some record on his tombstone of\r\nhis having played the clarionet in church; so above his name a\r\ntrumpet-shaped instrument was carved on the stone, and some doggerel\r\nlines were to be added below. The vicar had great difficulty in\r\npersuading the family to abandon the lines for the text, \"The trumpet\r\nshall sound, and the dead shall be raised.\"\r\n\r\nA neighbouring vicar was on one occasion taking the duty of an old man\r\nwith failing eyesight, and Dick reminded him before the afternoon\r\nservice that there was a funeral at four o'clock. \"You must come into\r\nthe church and tell me when it arrives,\" he told the clerk, \"and I will\r\nstop my sermon.\" It was the habit of the old clergyman to relapse into a\r\nstrong Yorkshire dialect when speaking familiarly, and this will account\r\nfor the brief dialogue which passed between him and Dick as he stood at\r\nthe lectern. In due course the funeral arrived at the church gates, and\r\nthe first intimation the congregation inside the church had of this fact\r\nwas the appearance of Dick, who noisily threw open the big doors of the\r\nsouth porch. He then stood and beckoned to the clergyman, but his poor\r\nblind eyes could not see so far. Dick then came nearer and waved his hat\r\nbefore him. This again met with no response. Then he got near enough to\r\npluck him by the arm, which he did rather vigorously, shouting at the\r\nsame time, \"Shoo's coomed.\" \"Wha's coomed?\" replied the clergyman,\r\nrelapsing into his Yorkshire speech. \"Funeral's coomed,\" retorted Dick.\r\n\"Then tell her to wait a bit while I finish my sermon\"; and the old man\r\nwent quietly on with his discourse.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of Dick's failing to give proper notice of a service\r\nwas as follows; but on this occasion it was not really his fault. Some\r\nlarge reservoirs were being made in the parish, and nearly a thousand\r\nnavvies were employed on the works. These men were constantly coming and\r\ngoing, and very often they brought some infectious disorder which spread\r\namong the huts where they lived. One day a navvy arrived who broke out\r\nin smallpox of a very severe kind, and in a couple of days the man died,\r\nand the doctor ordered the body to be buried the moment a coffin could\r\nbe got. It was winter-time, and the vicar had ridden over to see some\r\nfriends about ten miles away. As the afternoon advanced it began to rain\r\nvery heavily, and he decided not to ride back home, but to sleep at his\r\nfriend's house. About five o'clock a messenger arrived to say a funeral\r\nwas waiting in the church, and he was to come at once. He started in\r\ndrenching rain, which turned to sleet and snow as he approached the moor\r\nedges. It was pitch-dark when he got off his horse at the church gates,\r\nand with some difficulty he found his way into the vestry and put a\r\nsurplice over his wet garments. He could see nothing in the church, but\r\nhe asked when he got into the reading-desk if any one was there. A deep\r\nvoice answered, \"Yes, sir; we are here\"; and he began the service, which\r\nlong practice had taught him to repeat by heart. When about half-way\r\nthrough the lesson he saw a glimmer of light, and Dick entered the\r\nchurch with a lantern, which he placed on the top of the coffin. It was\r\na gruesome scene which the lantern brought into view. There was the\r\ncoffin, and before it, in a seat, four figures of the navvy-bearers, and\r\nDick himself covered with snow and as white as if he wore a surplice.\r\nThey filed out into the churchyard, but the wind had blown the snow into\r\nthe grave, and this had to be got out before they could lower the body\r\ninto it. The navvies, who were kind-hearted fellows, explained that they\r\ncould give no notice of the funeral beforehand, and they quite\r\nunderstood the delay was no fault of the vicar's or Dick's.\r\n\r\nDick was, in spite of his faults, an honest and kind-hearted man, and\r\nhis death, caused by a fall from a ladder, was much regretted by his\r\ngood vicar. On his death-bed the old clerk sent for his favourite\r\ngrandson, who succeeded him in his office, and made this pathetic\r\nrequest: \"Thou'lt dig my grave, Jont, lad.\"\r\n\r\nWith Dick the last of the \"Northern Lights\" flickered out. Nothing now\r\nremains in the village recalling those old times. The village inn has\r\nbeen suppressed, and the drinking bouts are over. The old church has\r\nbeen entirely restored, and there is order and decency in the services.\r\nThe strange thing is that it should have been possible that only forty\r\nyears ago matters were in such a state of chaos and disorder, and in\r\nsuch need of drastic reformation.\r\n\r\nAnother Yorkshire clerk flourished in the thirties at Bolton-on-Dearne\r\nnamed Thomas Rollin, commonly called Tommy. He used to render Psalm cii.\r\n6: \"I am become a _pee-li-can_ in the wilderness, and an owl in the\r\n_dee-sert_.\" Tommy was a tailor by trade, and made use of a\r\nready-reckoner to assist him in making up his accounts, and his\r\nfamiliarity with that useful book was shown when reading the second\r\nverse of the forty-fifth Psalm, which Tommy invariably read: \"My tongue\r\nis the pen of a _ready-reckoner_,\" to the immense delight of the\r\nyouthful members of the congregation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nAN OLD CHESHIRE CLERK AND SOME OTHER WORTHIES\r\n\r\nIt is nearly fifty years since I used to attend the quaint old parish\r\nchurch at Lawton, Cheshire, situate half-way between Congleton and\r\nCrewe. It is a lonely spot, \"miles from anywhere,\" having not the\r\nvestige of a village, and the congregation was formed of well-to-do\r\nfarmers, who came from the scattered farmsteads. How well I remember the\r\nold parish clerk and the numerous duties which fell to his lot! He\r\nunited in his person the offices of clerk, sexton, beadle,\r\nchurch-keeper, organist, and ringer. The organ was of the barrel kind,\r\nand no one knew how to manipulate the instrument or to change the\r\nbarrels, except the clerk. He had also to place ten decent loaves in a\r\nrow on the communion table every Sunday morning, which were provided by\r\na charitable bequest for the benefit of the poor widows of the parish.\r\nIf the widows did not attend service to curtsy for them, the loaves were\r\ngiven to any one who liked to take them. Old Clerk Briscall baked them\r\nhimself. He kept a small village shop about two miles from the church.\r\nHe was also the village shoemaker. A curious system prevailed. As you\r\nentered the church, near the large stove you would see a long bench, and\r\nunder this bench a row of boots and shoes. If any one wanted his boots\r\nto be mended, he would take them to church with him and put them under\r\nthe bench. These were collected by the cobbler-clerk, carried home in a\r\nsack, and brought back on the following Sunday neatly and carefully\r\nsoled and heeled. It would seem strange now if on entering a church our\r\neyes should light upon a row of farmers' dirty old boots and the\r\nfreshly-mended evidences of the clerk's skill. All this took place in\r\nthe fifties. In the sixties a new vicar came. The old organ wheezed its\r\nlast phlegmatic tune; it was replaced by a modern instrument with six\r\nstops, and a player who did his best, but occasioned not a little\r\nlaughter on account of his numerous breakdowns. The old high pews have\r\ndisappeared, nice open benches erected, the floor relaid, a good choir\r\nenlisted, and everything changed for the better.\r\n\r\nThe poor old clerk must have been almost overwhelmed by his numerous\r\nduties, and was often much embarrassed and exasperated by the old\r\nsquire, Mr. C.B. Lawton, who was somewhat whimsical in his ways. This\r\ngentleman used to enter the church by his own private door, and go to\r\nhis large, square, high-panelled family pew, and when the vicar gave out\r\nthe hymn, he used often to shout out, \"Here, hold on! I don't like that\r\none; let's have hymn Number 25,\" or some such effort of psalmody. This\r\nrequest, or command, used to upset the organ arrangement, and the poor\r\nold clerk had to rummage among his barrels to get a suitable tune, and\r\nthe operation, even if successful, took at least ten minutes, during\r\nwhich time a large amount of squeaking and the sounds of the writhing of\r\nwoodwork and snapping of sundry catches were heard in the church. But\r\nthe congregation was accustomed to the performance and thought little\r\nof it. (John Smallwood, 2 Mount Pleasant, Strangeways, Manchester.)\r\n\r\nCaistor Church, Lincolnshire, famous for the curious old ceremony of the\r\ngad-whip, was also celebrated for its clerk, old Joshua Foster, who was\r\nofficiating there in 1884 at the time of the advent of a new vicar.\r\nTrinity Sunday was the first Sunday of the new clergyman, who sorely\r\npuzzled the clerk by reading the Athanasian Creed. The old man peered\r\ndown into the vicar's family pew from his desk, casting a despairing\r\nglance at the wife of the vicar, who handed him a Prayer Book with the\r\nplace found, so that he could make the responses. He was very economical\r\nin the use of handkerchiefs, and used the small pieces of paper on which\r\nthe numbers of the metrical psalm were written. In vain did the wife of\r\nthe vicar present him with red-and-white-spotted handkerchiefs, which\r\nwere used as comforters. The church was lighted with tallow\r\ncandles--\"dips\" they were called--and at intervals during the service\r\nJoshua would go round and snuff them. The snuffers soon became full, and\r\nit was a matter of deep interest to the congregation to see on whose\r\nhead the snuff would fall, and to dodge it if it came their way.\r\n\r\nThe Psalms of Tate and Brady's version were sung and were given out with\r\nthe usual preface, \"Let us sing to the praise and glory of God the 1st,\r\n2nd, 5th, 8th, and 20th verses of the ---- Psalm with the Doxology.\"\r\nHow that Doxology bothered the congregation! The Doxologies were all at\r\nthe end of the Prayer Book, and it was not always easy to hit the right\r\nmetre; but that was of little consequence. A word added if the line was\r\ntoo short, or omitted if too long, required skill, and made all feel\r\nthat they had done their best when it was successfully over. After the\r\nold clerk's death, he was succeeded by his son Joshua, or Jos-a-way, as\r\nthe name was pronounced, whose son, also named Joshua the third, became\r\nclerk, and still holds the office.\r\n\r\nThe predecessor of the vicar was a pluralist, who held Caistor with its\r\ntwo chapelries of Holton and Clixby and the living of Rothwell. He was\r\nnon-resident, and the numerous churches were served by a curate. This\r\nman was a great smoker, and used to retire to the vestry to don the\r\nblack gown and smoke a pipe before the sermon, the congregation singing\r\na Psalm meanwhile. One Sunday he had an extra pipe, and Joshua told him\r\nthat the people were getting impatient.\r\n\r\n\"Let them sing another Psalm,\" said the curate.\r\n\r\n\"They have, sir,\" replied the clerk.\r\n\r\n\"Then let them sing the 119th,\" replied the curate.\r\n\r\nAt last he finished his pipe, and began to put on the black gown, but\r\nits folds were troublesome, and he could not get it on.\r\n\r\n\"I think the devil's in the gown,\" muttered the curate.\r\n\r\n\"I think he be,\" dryly replied old Joshua.\r\n\r\nThat the clerk was often a person of dignity and importance is shown by\r\nthe recollections of an old parishioner of the rector of Fornham All\r\nSaints, near Bury St. Edmunds. \"Mr. Baker, the clerk,\" of Westley, who\r\nflourished seventy years ago, used to hear the children their catechism\r\nin church on Sunday afternoons. \"Ah, sir, I often think of what he told\r\nus, that the world would not come to an end till people were killed\r\n_wholesale_, and now think how often that happens!\" She was probably not\r\nalluding to the South African or the Japanese war, but to railway\r\naccidents, as she at once told her favourite story of her solitary\r\njourney to Newmarket, when on her return she remarked, \"If I live to set\r\nfoot on firm ground, never no more for me.\"\r\n\r\nThe old clerk used to escort the boys and girls to their confirmation at\r\nBury, and superintended their meal of bread, beer, and cheese after the\r\nrite. There was no music at Westley, except when Mr. Humm, the clerk of\r\nFornham, \"brought up his fiddle and some of the Fornham girls.\"\r\nNowadays, adds the rector, the Rev. C.L. Feltoe, the clerks are much\r\nmore illiterate than their predecessors, and, unlike them,\r\nnon-communicants.\r\n\r\nAnother East Anglian clerk was a quaint character, who had a great\r\nrespect for all the old familiar residents in his town of S----, and a\r\ncorresponding contempt for all new-comers. The family of my informant\r\nhad resided there for nearly a century, and had, therefore, the approval\r\nof the clerk. On one occasion some of the family found their seat\r\noccupied by some new people who had recently settled in the town. The\r\nclerk rushed up, and in a loud voice, audible all over the church,\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Never you mind that air muck in your pew. I'll soon turn 'em out. The\r\nimperent muck, takin' your seats!\"\r\n\r\nThe family insisted upon \"the muck\" being left in peace, and forbade the\r\neviction.\r\n\r\nThe old clerk used vigorously a long stick to keep the school children\r\nin order. He was much respected, and his death universally regretted.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago there was a dear, good old clerk, named Bamford, at\r\nMangotsfield Church, who used to give out the hymns, verse by verse. The\r\nvicar always impressed upon him to read out the words in a loud voice,\r\nand at the last word in each verse to pitch his voice. The hymn, \"This\r\nworld's a dream,\" was rendered in this fashion:\r\n\r\n     \"This world's a _drame_, an empty shoe,\r\n      But this bright world to which I goo\r\n      Hath jaays substantial an' sincere,\r\n      When shall I wack and find me THEER?\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Smart, the parish clerk of Windermere in the sixties, was a rare\r\nspecimen. By trade an auctioneer and purveyor of Westmorland hams, he\r\nwas known all round the countryside. He was very patronising to the\r\nassistant curates, and a favourite expression of his was \"me and my\r\ncurate.\" When one of his curates first took a wedding he was commanded\r\nby the clerk, \"When you get to 'hold his peace,' do you stop, for I have\r\nsomething to say.\" The curate was obedient, and stopped at the end of\r\nhis prescribed words, when William shouted out, \"God speed them well!\"\r\n\r\nThis unauthorised but excellent clerkly custom was not confined to\r\nWindermere, but was common in several Norfolk churches, and at Hope\r\nChurch, Derbyshire, the clerk used to express the good wish after the\r\npublication of the banns.\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned clerk was usually much impressed by the importance of\r\nhis office. Crowhurst, the old clerk at Allington, Kent, in 1852, just\r\nbefore a wedding took place, marched up to the rector, the Rev. E.B.\r\nHeawood, and said:\r\n\r\n\"If you please, sir, the ceremony can't proceed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? What do you mean?\" asked the surprised rector.\r\n\r\n\"The marriage can't take place, sir,\" he answered solemnly, \"'cos I've\r\nlost my specs.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately a pupil of the rector's came forward and confessed that he\r\nhad hidden the old man's spectacles in a hole in the wall, and the\r\nceremony was no longer delayed.\r\n\r\nAt Bromley College the same clergyman had a curious experience, when the\r\nclerk was called to assist at a service for the Churching of Women. As\r\nit was very unusually performed there, he was totally at a loss what\r\nservice to find, and asked in great perturbation:\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir, be I to read the responses in the services for the Queen's\r\nAccession?\"\r\n\r\nThe same service sadly puzzled the clerk at Haddington, who was in the\r\nemployment of the then Earl of W----. One Sunday Lady W---- came to be\r\nchurched, when in response to the clergyman's prayer, \"O Lord, save this\r\nwoman, Thy servant,\" the clerk said, \"Who putteth her ladyship's\r\ntrust in Thee.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. W.H. Langhorne tells me some amusing anecdotes of old clerks.\r\nOnce he was preaching in a village church for home missions, and just as\r\nhe was reaching the pulpit he observed that the clerk was preparing to\r\ntake round the plate. He whispered to him to wait till he had finished\r\nhis sermon. \"It won't make a ha'porth o' difference,\" was the\r\nencouraging reply. But at the close of the sermon there was another\r\ninvitation to give additional offerings, which were not withheld.\r\n\r\nIn the old days when _Bell's Life_ was the chief sporting paper, a\r\nhunting parson was taking the service one Sunday morning and gave out\r\nthe day of the month and the Psalm. The clerk corrected him, but the\r\nrector again gave out the same day and was again corrected. The rector,\r\nin order to decide the controversy, produced a copy of _Bell's Life_ and\r\nhanded it to the clerk, who then submitted. It is not often, I imagine,\r\nthat a sporting paper has been appealed to for the purpose of deciding\r\nwhat Psalms should be read in church.\r\n\r\nOne very wet Sunday Mr. Langhorne was summoned to take an afternoon\r\nservice several miles distant from his residence. The congregation\r\nconsisted of only half a dozen people. After service he said to the\r\nclerk that it was hardly worth while coming so far. \"We might have done\r\nwith a worse 'un,\" was his reply.\r\n\r\nThat reminds me of another clerk who apologised to a church dignitary\r\nwho had been summoned to take a service at a small country church. The\r\nform of the apology was not quite happily expressed. He said, \"I am\r\nsorry, sir, to have brought such a gentleman as you to this poor place.\r\nA worse would have done, if we had only known where to find him!\"\r\n\r\nThe new vicar of D---- was calling upon an old parishioner, who said to\r\nhim: \"Ah! I've seen mony changes. I've seen four vicars of D----. First\r\nthere was Canon G----, then there was Mr. T----, who's now a bishop, and\r\nthen Mr. F---- came, and now you've coom, and we've wossened (worsened)\r\nevery toime.\"\r\n\r\nA clerk named Turner, who officiated at Alnwick, was a great character,\r\nand in spite of his odd ways was esteemed for his genuine worth and\r\nfidelity to the three vicars under whom he served. He looked upon the\r\nchurch and parish as his own, and used to say that he had trained many\r\n\"kewrats\" in their duties. His responses in the Psalms were often\r\nstartling. Instead of \"The Lord setteth up the meek,\" he would say,\r\n\"The Lord sitteth upon the meek.\" \"The great leviathan\" he rendered \"the\r\ngreat live thing.\" \"Caterpillars innumerable\" he pronounced\r\n\"caterpilliars innumerabble.\" When a funeral was late he scolded the\r\nbearers at the churchyard gate.\r\n\r\nAt Wimborne Minster, Dorset, there used to be three priest vicars, and\r\neach of them had a clerk. It was the custom for each of the priest\r\nvicars to take the services for a week in rotation, and the first lesson\r\nwas always read by \"the clerk of the week,\" as he was called. On\r\nSundays, when there was a celebration of the Holy Communion, the \"clerk\r\nof the week\" advanced to the lectern after the sermon was finished, and\r\nsaid, \"All who wish to receive the Holy Communion, draw near.\" These\r\nwords, in the case of one worthy, named David Butler, were always spoken\r\nin a high-pitched, drawling voice, and finished off with a kick to the\r\nrearwards of the right leg.\r\n\r\nThe old clerk at Woodmancote, near Henfield, Sussex, was a very\r\nimportant person. There was never any committee meeting but he attended.\r\nSo much so, that one day in church leading the singing and music with\r\nvoice and flute, when it came to the \"Gloria\" he sang loudly, \"As it was\r\nin the committee meeting, is now, and ever shall be ...\"\r\n\r\nAn acquaintance remarked to him afterwards that the last meeting he\r\nattended must have been a rather long one!\r\n\r\nA story is told of the clerk at West Dean, near Alfriston, Sussex.\r\nStarting the first line of the Psalm or hymn, he found that he could not\r\nsee owing to the failing light on a dark wintry afternoon. So he said,\r\n\"My eyes are dim, I canna see,\" at which the congregation, composed of\r\nignorant labourers, sang after him the _same_ words. The clerk was\r\nwroth, and cried out, \"Tarnation fools you all must be.\" Here again the\r\ncongregation sang the same words after the clerk.\r\n\r\nStrange times, strange manners!\r\n\r\nA writer in the _Spectator_ tells of a clerk who, like many of his\r\nfellows, used to convert \"leviathan\" into \"that girt livin' thing,\" thus\r\nletting loose before his hearers' imagination a whole travelling\r\nmenagerie, from which each could select the beast which most struck his\r\nfancy. This clerk was a picturesque personality, although, unlike his\r\npredecessor, he had discarded top-boots and cords for Sunday wear in\r\nfavour of black broadcloth. When not engaged in marrying or burying one\r\nof his flock, he fetched and carried for the neighbours from the\r\nadjacent country town, or sold herrings and oranges (what mysterious\r\naffinity is there between these two dissimilar edibles that they are\r\ninvariably hawked in company?) from door to door. During harvest he rang\r\nthe morning \"leazing bell\" to start the gleaners to the fields, and\r\nevery night he tolled the curfew, by which the villagers set their\r\nclocks. He it was who, when the sermon was ended, strode with dignity\r\nfrom his box on the \"lower deck\" down the aisle to the belfry, and\r\npulled the \"dishing-up bell\" to let home-keeping mothers know that\r\nhungry husbands and sons were set free. Folks in those days were less\r\neasily fatigued than they are now. Services were longer, the preacher's\r\n\"leanings to mercy\" were less marked, and congregations counted\r\nthemselves ill-used if they broke up under the two hours. The boys stood\r\nin wholesome awe of the clerk, as well they might, for his eye was keen\r\nand his stick far-reaching. Moreover, no fear of man prevented him from\r\napplying the latter with effect to the heads of slumberers during divine\r\nservice. By way of retaliation the youths, when opportunity occurred,\r\nwould tie the cord of the \"tinkler\" to the weathercock, and the parish\r\non a stormy night would be startled by the sound of ghostly, fitful\r\nting-tangs. To Sunday blows the clerk, who was afflicted with\r\nrheumatism, added weekday anathemas as he climbed the steep ascent to\r\nthe bell-chamber and the yet steeper ladder that gave access to the\r\nleads of the tower. The perpetual hostility that reigned between\r\ndiscipliner and disciplined bred no ill will on either side. \"Boys must\r\nbe boys\" and \"He's paid for lookin' arter things\" were the arguments\r\nwhereby the antagonists testified their mutual respect, in both of which\r\nthe parents concurred; and his severity did not cost the old man a penny\r\nwhen he made his Easter rounds to collect the \"sweepings.\" It may,\r\nperhaps, be well to explain that the \"sweepings\" consisted of an annual\r\nsum of threepence which every householder contributed towards the\r\ncleaning of the church, and which represented a large part of the\r\nclerk's salary[84].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: _Spectator_, 14 October, 1905.]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. C.C. Prichard recollects a curious old character at Churchdown,\r\nnear Gloucester, commonly pronounced \"Chosen\" in those days.\r\n\r\nThis old clerk was only absent one Sunday from \"Chosen\" Church, and then\r\nhe was lent to the neighbouring church of Leckhampton. Instead of the\r\nresponse \"And make Thy chosen people joyful,\" mindful of his change of\r\nlocality he gave out with a strong nasal twang, \"And make Thy\r\nLeck'ampton people joyful.\" The Psalms were somewhat a trouble to him,\r\nand to the congregation too. One verse he rendered \"Like a paycock in a\r\nwild-dook's nest, and a howl in the dessert, even so be I.\" He was a\r\nthoroughly good old man, and brought up a large family very respectably.\r\n\r\nI remember the old clerk, James Ingham, of Whalley Church, Lancashire.\r\nIt is a grand old church, full of old dark oak square pews, and the\r\nclerk was in keeping with his surroundings. He was a humorous character,\r\nand had a splendid deep bass voice. He used to show people over the\r\nruined abbey, and his imagination supplied the place of accurate\r\nhistorical information. Some American visitors asked him what a certain\r\npath was used for. \"Well, marm,\" said James, \"it's onsartin: but they do\r\nsay the monks and nuns used to walk up and down this 'ere path,\r\narm-in-arm, of a summer arternoon.\"\r\n\r\nIt is recorded of one Thomas Atkins, clerk of Chillenden Church, Kent,\r\nthat he used to leave his reading-desk at the commencement of the\r\nGeneral Thanksgiving and proceed to the west gallery, where he gave out\r\nthe hymn and sang a duet with the village cobbler, in which the\r\ncongregation joined as best they could. He walked very slowly down the\r\nchurch, and said the Amen at the end of the Thanksgiving wherever he\r\nhappened to be, and that was generally half-way up the gallery stairs,\r\nwhence his feeble voice, with a good _tremolo_, used to sound like the\r\ndistant baaing of a sheep. It was a strange and curious performance.\r\n\r\nMiss Rawnsley, of Raithby Hall, Spilsby, gives some delightful\r\nreminiscences of a most original specimen of the race of clerks, old\r\nHaw, who officiated at Halton Holgate, Lincolnshire. He was a curious\r\nmixture of worldly wisdom and strong religious feeling. The former was\r\nexemplified by his greeting to a cousin of my correspondent, just\r\nreturned from his ordination.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Now, Mr. Hardwick, remember thou must creep an' crawl along\r\nthe 'edge bottoms, and then tha'ill make thee a bishop.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a strong advocate of Fasting Communion. No one ever knew whence\r\nhe derived his strong views on the subject. The rector never taught it.\r\nProbably his ideas were derived from some long lingering tradition. When\r\nover seventy years of age he set out fasting to walk six miles to attend\r\na late celebration at a distant church on the occasion of its\r\nconsecration. Nothing would ever induce him to break his fast before\r\ncommunicating; and on this occasion he was picked up in a dead faint,\r\nhis journey being only half completed.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesdays and Fridays he always went into the church at eleven\r\no'clock and said the Litany aloud. When asked his reason, he said, \"I've\r\ngotten an ungodly wife and two ungodly bairns to pray for, sir.\" He once\r\nasked one of the rector's daughters to help him in the _Parody_ of the\r\nPsalms he was making; and on another occasion requested to have the old\r\naltar-cloth, which had just been replaced by a new one, \"to make a slop\r\nto dig the graves in, and no sacrilege neither.\"\r\n\r\nAt Sutton Maddock, Shropshire, there was a clerk who used to read\r\n\"_Pe_-li-_can_ in the wilderness,\" and the usual \"_Howl_ in the\r\n_De_sart,\" and \"Teach the _Se_nators wisdom,\" and when the Litany was\r\nsaid on Wednesdays and Fridays declared that it was not in his Prayer\r\nBook though he took part in it every Sunday. When a kind lady, Miss\r\nBarnfield, expressed a wish that his wife would get better, he replied,\r\n\"I hope her will or _summat_.\"\r\n\r\nAt Claverley, in the same county, on one Sunday, the rector told the\r\nclerk to give notice that there would be no service that afternoon,\r\nadding _sotto voce_, \"I am going to dine at the Paper Mill.\" He was\r\nrather disgusted when the clerk announced, \"There will be no Diving\r\nService this arternoon, the Parson is going to dine at the Peaper Mill.\"\r\nThe clerk was no respecter of persons, and once marched up to the\r\nrector's wife in church and told her to keep her eyes from\r\nbeholding vanity.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. F.A. Davis tells me of a story of an illiterate clerk who\r\nserved in a Wiltshire church, where a cousin of my informant was vicar.\r\nA London clergyman, who had never preached or been in a country church\r\nbefore, came to take the duty. He was anxious to find out if the people\r\nlistened or understood sermons. His Sunday morning discourse was based\r\non the text St. Mark v. 1-17, containing the account of the healing of\r\nthe demoniacally possessed persons at Gadara, and the destruction of the\r\nherd of swine. On the Monday he asked the clerk if he understood the\r\nsermon. The clerk replied somewhat doubtfully, \"Yes.\" \"But is there\r\nanything you do not quite understand?\" said the clergyman; \"I shall be\r\nonly too glad to explain anything I can, so as to help you.\" After a\r\ngood deal of scratching the back of his head and much hesitating, the\r\nclerk replied, \"Who paid for them pigs?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM HINTON, A WILTSHIRE WORTHY DRAWN BY THE REV.\r\nJULIAN CHARLES YOUNG]\r\n\r\nMany examples I have given of the dry humour of old clerks, which is\r\nsometimes rather disconcerting. A stranger was taking the duty in a\r\nchurch, and after service made a few remarks about the weather,\r\nasserting that it promised to be a fine day for the haymaking to-morrow.\r\n\"Ah, sir,\" replied the clerk, \"they do say that the hypocrites can\r\ndiscern the face of the sky.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Julian Charles Young, rector of Ilmington, in his _Memoir of\r\nCharles Mayne Young, Tragedian_, published in 1871, speaks of the race\r\nof parish clerks who flourished in Wiltshire in the first half of the\r\nlast century. Instead of a nice discrimination being exercised in the\r\nchoice of a clerk, it seems to have been the rule to select the sorriest\r\ndriveller that could be found--some \"lean and slippered pantaloon, with\r\nspectacles on nose and pouch at side,\"\r\n\r\n     \"triumphant over time,\r\n     And over tune, and over rhyme\"--\r\n\r\nwho by his snivelling enunciation of the responses and his nasal\r\ndrawlings of the A--mens, was sure to provoke the risibility of his\r\nhearers. Mr. Young's own clerk was, however, a very worthy man, of such\r\nlofty aspirations and of such blameless purity of life, that in making\r\nhim Nature made the very ideal of a village clerk and schoolmaster, and\r\nthen \"broke the mould.\" His grave yet kindly countenance, his\r\nwell-proportioned limbs encased in breeches and gaiters of corded\r\nkerseymere, and the natural dignity of his carriage, combined \"to give\r\nthe world assurance of\" a bishop rather than a clerk. It needed\r\nfamiliarity with his inner life to know how much simpleness of purpose\r\nand simplicity of mind and contentment and piety lay hid under a pompous\r\nexterior and a phraseology somewhat stilted.\r\n\r\nHis name was William Hinton, and he dwelt in a small whitewashed cottage\r\nwhich, by virtue of his situation as schoolmaster, he enjoyed rent free.\r\nIt stood in the heart of a small but well-stocked kitchen garden. His\r\nsalary was £40 per annum, and on this, with perhaps £5 a year more\r\nderived from church fees, he brought up five children in the greatest\r\nrespectability, all of whom did well in life. They regarded their\r\nfather with absolute veneration. By the side of the labourer who only\r\nknew what he had taught him, or of the farmer who knew less, he was a\r\ngiant among pygmies--a Triton among minnows.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Young went to the village, with the exception of a Bible, a\r\nPrayer Book, a random tract or two, and a _Moore's Almanac_, there was\r\nscarcely a book to be found in it. The rector kindly allowed his clerk\r\nthe run of his well-stocked library. Hinton devoured the books greedily.\r\nSo receptive and imitative was his intellect that his conversation, his\r\ndeportment, even his spirit, became imbued with the individuality of the\r\nauthor whose writings he had been studying. After reading Dr. Johnson's\r\nworks his conversation became sententious and dogmatic. _Lord\r\nChesterfield's Letters_ produced an airiness and jauntiness that were\r\nquite foreign to his nature. His favourite authors were Jeremy Taylor,\r\nBacon, and Milton. After many months reverential communion with these\r\nGoliaths of literature he became pensive and contemplative, and his\r\nmanner more chastened and severe. The secluded village in which he dwelt\r\nhad been his birthplace, and there he remained to the day of his death.\r\nHe knew nothing of the outer world, and the rector found his intercourse\r\nwith a man so original, fresh, and untainted a real pleasure. He was\r\nphysically timid, and the account of a voyage across the Channel or a\r\njourney by coach filled him with dread. One day he said to Mr. Young,\r\n\"Am I, reverend sir, to understand that you voluntarily trust your\r\nperishable body to the outside of a vehicle, of the soundness of which\r\nyou know nothing, and suffer yourself to be drawn to and fro by four\r\nstrange animals, of whose temper you are ignorant, and are willing to\r\nbe driven by a coachman of whose capacity and sobriety you are\r\nuninformed?\" On being assured that such was the case, he concluded that\r\n\"the love of risk and adventure must be a very widely-spread instinct,\r\nseeing that so many people are ready to expose themselves to such\r\nfearful casualties.\" He was grateful to think that he had never been\r\nexposed to such terrific hazards. What the worthy clerk would have said\r\nconcerning the risks of motoring somewhat baffles imagination.\r\n\r\nWhen just before the opening of the Great Western Railway line the\r\nCompany ran a coach through the village from Bath to Swindon, the clerk\r\nwitnessed with his own eyes the dangers of travelling. The school\r\nchildren were marshalled in line to welcome the coach, bouquets of\r\nlaurestina and chrysanthema were ready to be bestowed on the passengers,\r\nthe church bells rang gaily, when after long waiting the cheery notes of\r\nthe key-bugle sounded the familiar strains of \"Sodger Laddie,\" and the\r\nsteaming steeds hove in sight, an accident occurred. At a sharp turn\r\njust opposite the clerk's house the swaying coach overturned, and the\r\noutside passengers were thrown into the midst of his much-prized\r\nash-leaf kidneys. The clerk fled precipitately to the extreme borders of\r\nhis domain, and afterwards said to the rector, \"Ah, sir, was I right in\r\nsaying I would never enter such a dangerous carriage as a four-horse\r\ncoach? I assure you I was not the least surprised. It was just what I\r\nexpected.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the first railway train passed through the village he was\r\noverwhelmed with emotion at the sight. He fell prostrate on the bank as\r\nif struck by a thunder-bolt. When he stood up his brain reeled, he was\r\nspeechless, and stood aghast, unutterable amazement stamped upon his\r\nface. In the tone of a Jeremiah he at length gasped out, \"Well, sir,\r\nwhat a sight to have seen: but one I never care to see again! How awful!\r\nI tremble to think of it! I don't know what to compare it to, unless it\r\nbe to a messenger despatched from the infernal regions with a commission\r\nto spread desolation and destruction over the fair land. How much longer\r\nshall knowledge be allowed to go on increasing?\"\r\n\r\nThe rector taught the clerk how to play chess, to which game he took\r\neagerly, and taught it to the village youths. They played it on\r\nhalf-holidays in winter and became engrossed in it, manufacturing\r\nchess-boards out of old book-covers and carving very creditable chessmen\r\nout of bits of wood. When he was playing with his rector one evening he\r\nlost his queen and at once resigned, saying, \"I consider, reverend sir,\r\nthat chess without a queen is like life without a female.\"\r\n\r\nHinton knew not a word of Latin, but he had a pedantic pleasure in\r\nintroducing it whenever he could. Genders were ever a mystery to him,\r\nthough with the help of a dictionary he would often substitute a Latin\r\nfor an English word. Thus he used the signatures \"Gulielmus\r\nHintoniensis, Rusticus Sacrista,\" and when writing to Mrs. Young he\r\nalways addressed her as \"Charus Domina.\" On this lady's return after a\r\nlong absence, the clerk wrote in large letters, \"Gratus, gratus,\r\noptatus,\" and dated his greeting, \"Martius quinta, 1842.\" A funeral\r\nnotice was usually sent in doggerel.\r\n\r\nThe following letter was sent to the rector's unmarried sister:\r\n\r\n     \"_Januarius Prima_, 1840.\r\n\r\n     \"CHARUS DOMINA,\r\n\r\n\"That the humble Sacrista should be still retained on the tablets of\r\nyour memory is an unexpected pleasure. Your gift, as a criterion of your\r\nesteem, will be often looked at with delight, and be carefully\r\npreserved, as a memorial of your friendship; and for which I beg to\r\nreturn my sincere thanks. May the meridian sunshine of happiness\r\nbrighten your days through the voyage of life; and may your soul be\r\nborne on the wings of seraphic angels to the realms of bliss eternal in\r\nthe world to come is the sincere wish and fervent prayer of Charus\r\nDomina, your most obedient, most respectful, most obliged servant,\r\n\r\n     \"GULIELMUS HINTONIENSIS,\r\n\r\n     \"_Rusticus Sacrista_.\r\n\r\n     \"GRATITUDE\r\n\r\n     \"A gift from the virtuous, the fair, and the good,\r\n       From the affluent to the humble and low,\r\n     Is a favour so great, so obliging and kind,\r\n       To acknowledge I scarcely know how.\r\n     I fain would express the sensations I feel,\r\n       By imploring the blessing of Heaven\r\n     May be showered on the lovely, the amiable maid,\r\n       Who this gift to Sacrista has given.\r\n     May the choicest of husbands, the best of his kind,\r\n       Be hers by the appointment of Heaven!\r\n     And may sweet smiling infants as pledges of love\r\n       To crown her connubium be given.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is a characteristic note of this worthy clerk, which\r\ndiffers somewhat from the notices usually sent to vicars as reminders of\r\napproaching weddings:\r\n\r\n\"REV. SIR,\r\n\r\n\"I hope it has not escaped your memory that the young couple at Clack\r\nare hoping to offer incense at the shrine of Venus this morning at the\r\nhour of ten. I anticipate the bridegrooms's anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"RUSTICUS SACRISTA.\"\r\n\r\nHe was somewhat curious on the subject of fashionable ladies' dresses,\r\nand once asked the rector \"in what guise feminine respectability usually\r\nappeared at an evening party?\" When a low dress was described to him, he\r\nblushed and shivered and exclaimed, \"Then methinks, sir, there must be\r\nrevelations of much which modesty would gladly veil.\" He was terribly\r\novercome on one occasion when he met in the rector's drawing-room one\r\nevening some ladies who were attired, as any other gentlewomen would be,\r\nin low gowns.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hinton was, in spite of his air of importance and his inflated\r\nphraseology, a simple, single-minded, humble soul. When the rector\r\nvisited him on his death-bed, he greeted Mr. Young with as much serenity\r\nof manner as if he had been only going on a journey to a far country for\r\nwhich he had long been preparing. \"Well, reverend and dear sir. Here we\r\nare, you see! come to the nightcap scene at last! Doubtless you can\r\ndiscern that I am dying. I am not afraid to die. I wish your prayers....\r\nI say I am not afraid to die, and you know why. Because I know in whom I\r\nhave believed; and I am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I\r\nhave committed unto Him against that day.\" A little later he said,\r\n\"Thanks, reverend sir! Thanks for much goodwill! Thanks for much happy\r\nintercourse! For nearly seven years we have been friends here. I trust\r\nwe shall be still better friends hereafter. I shall not see you again on\r\nthis side Jordan. I fear not to cross over. Good-bye. My Joshua beckons\r\nme. The Promised Land is in sight.\"\r\n\r\nThis worthy and much-mourned clerk was buried on 5 July, 1843.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE CLERK AND THE LAW\r\n\r\nThe parish clerk is so important a person that divers laws have been\r\nframed relating to his office. His appointment, his rights, his\r\ndismissal are so closely regulated by law that incumbents and\r\nchurchwardens have to be very careful lest they in any way transgress\r\nthe legal enactments and judgments of the courts. It is not an easy\r\nmatter to dismiss an undesirable clerk: it is almost as difficult as to\r\ndisturb the parson's freehold; and unless the clerk be found guilty of\r\ngrievous faults, he may laugh to scorn the malice of his enemies and\r\nretain his office while life lasts.\r\n\r\nIt may be useful, therefore, to devote a chapter to the laws relating to\r\nparish clerks--a chapter which some of my readers who have no liking for\r\nlegal technicalities can well afford to skip.\r\n\r\nAs regards his qualifications the clerk must be at least twenty years of\r\nage, and known to the parson as a man of honest conversation, and\r\nsufficient for his reading, writing, and for his competent skill in\r\nsinging, \"if it may be[85].\" The visitation articles of the seventeenth\r\ncentury frequently inquire whether the clerk be of the age of twenty\r\nyears at least.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: Canon 91 (1603).]\r\n\r\nThe method of his appointment has caused much disputing. With whom does\r\nthe appointment rest? In former times the parish clerk was always\r\nnominated by the incumbent both by common law and the custom of the\r\nrealm. This is borne out by the constitution of Archbishop Boniface and\r\nthe 91st Canon, which states that \"No parish clerk upon any vacation\r\nshall be chosen within the city of London or elsewhere, but by the\r\nparson or vicar: or where there is no parson or vicar, by the minister\r\nof that place for the time being; which choice shall be signified by the\r\nsaid minister, vicar or parson, to the parishioners the next Sunday\r\nfollowing, in the time of Divine Service.\"\r\n\r\nBut this arrangement has often been the subject of dispute between the\r\nparson and his flock as to the right of the former to appoint the clerk.\r\nIn pre-Reformation times there was a diversity of practice, some\r\nparishioners claiming the right to elect the clerk, as they provided the\r\nofferings by which he lived. A terrible scene occurred in the fourteenth\r\ncentury at one church. The parishioners appointed a clerk, and the\r\nrector selected another. The rector was celebrating Mass, assisted by\r\nhis clerk, when the people's candidate approached the altar and nearly\r\nmurdered his rival, so that blood was shed in the sanctuary.\r\n\r\nCustom in many churches sanctioned the right of the parishioners, who\r\nsometimes neglected to exercise it, and the choice of clerk was left to\r\nthe vicar. The visitations in the time of Elizabeth show that the people\r\nwere expected to appoint to the office, but the episcopal inquiries also\r\ndemonstrate that the parson or vicar could exercise a veto, and that no\r\none could be chosen without his goodwill and consent.\r\n\r\nThe canon of 1603 was an attempt to change this variety of usage, but\r\nsuch is the force of custom that many decisions of the spiritual courts\r\nhave been against the canon and in favour of accustomed usage when such\r\ncould be proved. It was so in the case of _Cundict_ v. _Plomer_ (8 Jac.\r\nI)[86], and in _Jermyn's Case_ (21 Jac. I).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: _Ecclesiastical Law_, Sir R. Phillimore, p. 1901.]\r\n\r\nAt the present time such disputes with regard to the appointment of\r\nclerks are unlikely to arise. They are usually elected to their office\r\nby the vestry, and the person recommended by the vicar is generally\r\nappointed. Indeed, by the Act 7 & 8 Victoria, c. 49, \"for better\r\nregulating the office of Lecturers and Parish Clerks,\" it is provided\r\nthat when the appointment is by others than the parson, it is to be\r\nsubject to the approval of the parson. Owing to the difficulty of\r\ndismissing a clerk, to which I shall presently refer, it is not unusual\r\nto appoint a gentleman or farmer to the office, and to nominate a deputy\r\nto discharge the actual duties. If we may look forward to a revival of\r\nthe office and to a restoration of its ancient dignity and importance,\r\nit might be possible for the more highly educated man to perform the\r\nchief functions, the reading the lessons and epistle, serving at the\r\naltar, and other like duties, while his deputy could perform the more\r\nmenial functions, opening the church, ringing the bell, digging graves,\r\nif there be no sexton, and the like.\r\n\r\nIt is not absolutely necessary that the clerk, after having been chosen\r\nand appointed, should be licensed by the ordinary, but this is not\r\nunusual; and when licensed he is sworn to obey the incumbent of the\r\nparish[87].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: _Ibid._, 1902.]\r\n\r\nWe have recorded some of the perquisites, fees and wages, which the\r\nclerk of ancient times was accustomed to receive when he had been duly\r\nappointed. No longer does he receive accustomed alms by reason of his\r\noffice of _aquæbajalus_. No longer does he derive profit from bearing\r\nthe holy loaf; and the cakes and eggs at Easter, and certain sheaves at\r\nharvest-tide, are perquisites of the past.\r\n\r\nThe following were the accustomed wages of the clerk at Rempstone in the\r\nyear 1629[88]:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: _The Clerks' Book_, Dr. Wickham Legg, lv.]\r\n\r\n     \"22nd November, 1629.\r\n\r\n     \"The wages of the Clarke of the Parish Church of Rempstone.\r\n     At Easter yearely he is to have of every Husbandman one\r\n     pennie for every yard land he hath in occupation. And of\r\n     every Cottager two pence.\r\n\r\n     \"Furthermore he is to have for every yard land one peche of\r\n     Barley of the Husbandman yearely.\r\n\r\n     \"Egges at Easter by Courtesie.\r\n\r\n     \"For every marriage two pence. And at the churching of a\r\n     woman his dinner.\r\n\r\n     \"The said Barley is to be payed between Christmasse and the\r\n     Feast of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\"\r\n\r\nClerk's Ales have vanished, too, together with the cakes and eggs, but\r\nhis fees remain, and marriage bells and funeral knells, christenings and\r\nchurchings bring to him the accustomed dues and offerings. Tables of\r\nFees hang in most churches. It is important to have them in order that\r\nno dispute may arise. The following table appears in the parish books of\r\nSalehurst, Sussex, and is curious and interesting:\r\n\r\n     \"April 18, 1597.\r\n\r\n     \"Memorandum that the duties for Churchinge of women in the\r\n     parishe of Salehurst is unto the minister ix d. b. and unto\r\n     the Clarke ij d.\r\n\r\n     \"Item the due unto the minister for a marriadge is xxj d.\r\n     And unto the Clarke ij d. the Banes, and iiij d. the\r\n     marriadge.\r\n\r\n     \"Item due for burialls as followeth\r\n        To the Minister in the Chancell . .      xiii s.   iiij d.\r\n        To the Clarke in the Chancell . .          vi s.  viiij d.\r\n        To the Parish in the Church . . .          vi s.   viii d.\r\n        To the Clarke in the Church . . .           v s.      o d.\r\n        To the Clarke in the churchyard for great\r\n          coffins . . . . . . .                    ii s.     vi d.\r\n        For great Corses uncoffined . . .          ii s.      o d.\r\n        For Chrisomers and such like coffined .     i s.   iiii d.\r\n        And uncoffined . . . . .                            xij d.\r\n        For tolling the passing bell and houre .    i s.\r\n        For ringing the sermon bell an houre .      i s.      0 d.\r\n        To the Clarke for carrying the beere .             iiij d.\r\n        If it be fetched . . . . .                           ij d.\r\n\r\n     \"Item for funerals the Minister is to have the mourning\r\n     pullpit Cloth and the Clarke the herst Cloth.\r\n\r\n     \"Item the Minister hathe ever chosen the parishe Clarke and\r\n     one of the Churchwardens and bothe the Sydemen.\r\n\r\n     \"Item if they bring a beere or poles with the corps the\r\n     Clarke is to have them.\r\n\r\n     \"If any Corps goe out of the parish they are to pay double\r\n     dutyes and to have leave.\r\n\r\n     \"If any Corps come out of another parish to be buryed here,\r\n     they are to pay double dutyes besides breakinge the ground;\r\n     which is xiij s. 4 d. in the church, and vi s. viii d. in the\r\n     churchyard.\r\n\r\n     \"For marryage by licence double fees both to the Minister and\r\n     Clarke[89].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: _Sussex Archæological Collections_, 1873, vol. xxv. p.\r\n154.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the fees to which the clerk is entitled by\r\nlong-established custom, he receives wages, which he can recover by law\r\nif he be unjustly deprived of them. Churchwardens who in the old days\r\nneglected to levy a church rate in order to pay the expenses of the\r\nparish and the salary of the clerk, have been compelled by law to do so,\r\nin order to satisfy the clerk's claims.\r\n\r\nThe wages which he received varied considerably. The churchwardens'\r\naccounts reveal the amounts paid the holders of the office at different\r\nperiods. At St. Mary's, Reading, there are the items in 1557:\r\n\r\n     \"Imprimis the Rent of the Clerke's\r\n     howse . . . . . .                             vi s. viii d.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Paid to Marshall (the clerk) for parcell of\r\n     his wages that he was unpaide . .             v s.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1561 the clerk's wages were 40 s., in 1586 only 20 s. At St. Giles's,\r\nReading, in 1520, he received 26 s. 8 d., as the following entry shows:\r\n\r\n     \"Paid to Harry Water Clerk for his\r\n     wage for a yere ended at thannacon\r\n     (the Annunciation) of Our Lady. xxvi s. viii.\"\r\n\r\nThe clerk at St. Lawrence, Reading, received 20 s. for his services in\r\n1547. Owing to the decrease in the value of money the wages gradually\r\nrose in town churches, but in the eighteenth century in many country\r\nplaces 10 s. was deemed sufficient. The sum of £10 is not an unusual\r\nwage at the present time for a village clerk.\r\n\r\nThe dismissal of a parish clerk was a somewhat difficult and dangerous\r\ntask. In the eyes of the law he is no menial servant--no labourer who\r\ncan be discharged if he fail to please his master. The law regards him\r\nas an officer for life, and one who has a freehold in his place. Sixty\r\nyears ago no ecclesiastical court could deprive him of his office, but\r\nhe could be censured for his faults and misdemeanours, though not\r\ndischarged. Several cases have appeared in the law courts which have\r\ndecided that as long as a clerk behaves himself well, he has a good\r\nright and title to continue in his office. Thus in _Rex_ v. _Erasmus\r\nWarren_ (16 Geo. III) it was shown that the clerk became bankrupt, had\r\nbeen guilty of many omissions in his office, was actually in prison at\r\nthe time of his amoval, and had appointed a deputy who was totally unfit\r\nfor the office. Against which it was insisted that the office of parish\r\nclerk was a temporal office during life, that the parson could not\r\nremove him, and that he had a right to appoint a deputy. One of the\r\njudges stated that though the minister might have power of removing the\r\nclerk on a good and sufficient cause, he could never be the sole judge\r\nand remove him at pleasure, without being subject to the control of the\r\ncourt. No misbehaviour of consequence was proved against him, and the\r\nclerk was restored to his office.\r\n\r\nIn a more recent case the clerk had conducted himself on several\r\noccasions by designedly irreverent and ridiculous behaviour in his\r\nperformance of his duty. He had appeared in church drunk, and had\r\nindecently disturbed the congregation during the administration of Holy\r\nCommunion. He had been repeatedly reproved by the vicar, and finally\r\nremoved from his office. But the court decided that because the clerk\r\nhad not been summoned to answer for his conduct before his removal, a\r\nmandamus should be issued for his restoration to his office[90].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: _Ecclesiastical Law_, Sir R. Phillimore, p. 1907.]\r\n\r\nNo deputy clerk when removed can claim to be restored. It will be\r\ngathered, therefore, that an incumbent is compelled by law to restore a\r\nclerk removed by him without just cause, that the justice of the cause\r\nis not determined in the law courts by an _ex-parte_ statement of the\r\nincumbent, and that an accused clerk must have an opportunity of\r\nanswering the charges made against him. If a man performs the duties of\r\nthe office for one year he gains a settlement, and cannot afterwards be\r\nremoved without just cause.\r\n\r\nAn important Act was passed in 1844, to which I have already referred,\r\nfor the better regulating the office of lecturers and parish clerks.\r\nSections 5 and 6 of this Act bear directly on the method of removal of a\r\nclerk who may be guilty of neglect or misbehaviour. I will endeavour to\r\ndivest the wording of the Act from legal technicalities, and write it in\r\n\"plain English.\"\r\n\r\nIf a complaint is made to the archdeacon, or other ordinary, with regard\r\nto the misconduct of a clerk, stating that he is an unfit and improper\r\nperson to hold that office, the archdeacon may summon the clerk and call\r\nwitnesses who shall be able to give evidence or information with regard\r\nto the charges made. He can examine these witnesses upon oath, and hear\r\nand determine the truth of the accusations which have been made against\r\nthe clerk. If he should find these charges proved he may suspend or\r\nremove the offender from his office, and give a certificate under his\r\nhand and seal to the incumbent, declaring the office vacant, which\r\ncertificate should be affixed to the door of the church. Then another\r\nperson may be elected or appointed to the vacant office: \"Provided\r\nalways, that the exercise of such office by a sufficient deputy who\r\nshall duly and faithfully perform the duties thereof, and in all\r\nrespects well and properly demean himself, shall not be deemed a wilful\r\nneglect of his office on the part of such church clerk, chapel clerk, or\r\nparish clerk, so as to render him liable, for such cause alone, to be\r\nsuspended or removed therefrom.\"\r\n\r\nA special section of the Act deals with such possessions as clerks'\r\nhouses, buildings, lands or premises, held by a clerk by virtue of his\r\noffice. If, when deprived of his office, he should refuse to give up\r\nsuch buildings or possessions, the matter must be brought before the\r\nbishop of the diocese, who shall summon the clerk to appear before him.\r\nIf he fail to appear, or if the bishop should decide against him, the\r\nbishop shall grant a certificate of the facts to the person or persons\r\nentitled to the possession of the land or premises, who may thereupon go\r\nbefore a justice of the peace. The magistrate shall then issue his\r\nwarrant to the constables to expel the clerk from the premises, and to\r\nhand them over to the rightful owners, the cost of executing the warrant\r\nbeing levied upon the goods and chattels of the expelled clerk. If this\r\ncost should be disputed, it shall be determined by the magistrate.\r\nHappily few cases arise, but perhaps it is well to know the procedure\r\nwhich the law lays down for the carrying out of such troublesome\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nThe law also takes cognizance of the humbler office of sexton, the\r\nduties of which are usually combined in country places with those of the\r\nparish clerk. The sexton is, of course, the sacristan, the keeper of the\r\nholy things relating to divine worship, and seems to correspond with the\r\n_ostarius_ in the Roman Church. His duties consist in the care of the\r\nchurch, the vestments and vessels, in keeping the church clean, in\r\nringing the bells, in opening and closing the doors for divine service,\r\nand to these the task of digging graves and the care of the churchyard\r\nare also added. He is appointed by the churchwardens if his duties be\r\nconfined to the church, but if he is employed in the churchyard the\r\nappointment is vested in the rector. If his duties embrace the care of\r\nboth church and churchyard, he should be appointed by the churchwardens\r\nand incumbent jointly[91].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: _Ecclesiastical Law_, p. 1914.]\r\n\r\nMany cases have come before the law courts relating to sextons and their\r\nelection and appointment. He does not usually hold the same fixity of\r\ntenure as the parish clerk, he being a servant of the parish rather than\r\nan officer or one that has a freehold in his place; but in some cases a\r\nsexton has determined his right to hold the office for life, and gained\r\na mandamus from the court to be restored to his position after having\r\nbeen removed by the churchwardens.\r\n\r\nThe law has also decided that women may be appointed sextons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nRECOLLECTIONS OF OLD CLERKS AND THEIR WAYS\r\n\r\nPersonal recollections of the manners and curious ways of old village\r\nclerks are valuable, and several writers have kindly favoured me with\r\nthe descriptions of these quaint personages, who were well known to them\r\nin the days of their youth.\r\n\r\nThe clerk of a Midland village was an old man who combined with his\r\nsacred functions the secular calling of the keeper of the village inn.\r\nHe was very deaf, and consequently spoke in a loud, harsh voice, and\r\nscraps of conversation which were heard in the squire's high square box\r\npew occasioned much amusement among the squire's sons. The Rev. W.V.\r\nVickers records the following incidents:\r\n\r\nIt was \"Sacrament Sunday,\" and part of the clerk's duty was to prepare\r\nthe Elements in the vestry, which was under the western tower.\r\nApparently the wine was not forthcoming when wanted, and we heard the\r\nfollowing stage-aside in broad Staffordshire: \"Weir's the bottle? Oh!\r\n'ere it is, under the teeble (table) all the whoile.\"\r\n\r\nAnother part of his duty was to sing in the choir, for which purpose he\r\nused to leave the lower deck of the three-decker and hobble with his\r\nheavy oak stick to the chancel for the canticles and hymns, and having\r\nswelled the volume of praise, hobble back again, a pause being made for\r\nhis journey both to and fro. Not only did he sing in the choir but he\r\ngave out the hymns. This he did in a peculiar sing-song voice with\r\nup-and-down cadences: \"Let us sing (low) to the praise (high) and glory\r\n(low) of God (high) the hundredth (low) psalm (high).\" Very much the\r\nsame intonation accompanied his reading of the alternate verses of\r\nthe Psalms.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion a locum tenens, who officiated for a few weeks, was\r\n_stone_ deaf. Hence a difficulty arose in his knowing when our worthy,\r\nand the congregation, had finished each response or verse. This the\r\nclerk got over by keeping one hand well forward upon his book and\r\nraising the fingers as he came to the close. This was the signal to the\r\ndeaf man above him that it was _his_ turn! The old man, by half sitting\r\nupon a table in the belfry, could chime the four bells. It was his\r\nhabit, instead of going by his watch, to look out for the first\r\nappearance of my father's carriage (an old-fashioned \"britska,\" I\r\nbelieve it was called, with yellow body and wheels and large black hood,\r\nand so very conspicuous) at a certain part of the road, and then, and\r\nnot till then, commence chiming. It was a compliment to my father's\r\npunctuality; but what happened when, by chance, he failed to attend\r\nchurch I know not--but such occasions were rare[92].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: In olden days it seems to have been the usual practice in\r\nmany churches to delay service until the advent of the squire. Every one\r\nknows the old story of how, through some inadvertence, the minister had\r\nnot looked out to see that the great man was in his accustomed pew. He\r\nbegan, \"When the wicked man--\" The parish clerk tugged him by his coat,\r\nsaying, \"Please, sir, he hasn't come yet!\" As to whether the clergyman\r\ntook the hint and waited for \"the wicked man\" history sayeth not.\r\nAnother clerk told a young deacon, who was impatient to begin the\r\nservice, \"You must wait a bit, sir, we ain't ready.\" He then clambered\r\non the Communion table, and peered through the east window, which\r\ncommanded a view of the door in the wall of the squire's garden. \"Come\r\ndown!\" shouted the curate. \"I can see best where I be,\" replied the\r\nimperturbable clerk; \"I'm watching the garden door. Here she be, and the\r\nsquire.\" Whereupon he clambered down again, and without much further\r\ndelay the service proceeded.]\r\n\r\nOur _parish_ church we seldom attended, for the simple reason that the\r\naged vicar was scarcely audible; but there the clerk, after robing the\r\nvicar, mounted to the gallery above the vestry, where, taking a front\r\nseat, he watched for the exit of the vicar (whose habit it was to wait\r\nfor the young men, who also waited in the church porch for him to begin\r\nthe service!), and then, taking his seat at the organ, commenced the\r\nvoluntary. It was his duty also to give out the hymns. I have known him\r\nplay an eight-line tune to a four-line verse (or psalm--we used Tate and\r\nBrady), repeating the words of each verse twice!\r\n\r\nThe organ produced the most curious sounds. In course of time the mice\r\ngot into it, and the churchwardens, of whom the clerk was one,\r\napproached the vicar with the information, at the same time venturing a\r\nhint that the organ was quite worn out and that a harmonium would be\r\nmore acceptable to the congregation than the present music. His reply\r\nwas that a harmonium was not a sufficiently sacred instrument, and\r\nadded, \"Let a mouse-trap be set at once.\"\r\n\r\nRobert Dicker, quondam cabinet-maker in the town of Crediton, Devon,\r\nreigned for many years as parish clerk to the, at one time, collegiate\r\nchurch of the same town. He appears to have fulfilled his office\r\nsatisfactorily up to about 1870, when his mind became somewhat feeble.\r\nNevertheless, no desire was apparent to shorten the days of his office,\r\nas he was regular in his attendance and musically inclined; but when he\r\nbegan to play pranks upon the vicar it became necessary to consider the\r\nadvisability of finding a substitute who should do the work and receive\r\nhalf the pay. One of his escapades was to stand up in the middle of\r\nservice and call the vicar a liar; at another time he announced that a\r\nwedding was to take place on a certain day. The vicar, therefore,\r\nattended and waited for an hour, when the clerk affirmed that he must\r\nhave dreamed it! Dicker was given to the study of astronomy, and it is\r\nrelated that he once gave a lecture on this subject in the Public Rooms.\r\nThere is close to the town a small park in memory of one of the Duller\r\nfamily. A man one night was much alarmed when walking therein to\r\ndiscover a bright light in one of the trees, and, later, to hear the\r\nvoice of the worthy clerk, who addressed him in these words: \"Fear not,\r\nmy friend, and do not be affrighted. I am Robert Dicker, clerk of the\r\nparish. I am examining the stars.\" Another account alleges that he\r\naffirmed himself to be \"counting the stars.\" Whichever account is the\r\ntrue one, it will be gathered that he was already \"far gone.\"\r\n\r\nAnother of his achievements was the conversion of a barrel organ,\r\npurchased from a neighbouring church, into a manual, obtaining the wind\r\ntherefor by a pedal arrangement which worked a large wheel attached to a\r\ncrank working the bellows. On all great festivals and especially on\r\nChristmas Day he was wont to rouse the neighbourhood as early as three\r\nand four o'clock, remarking of the ungrateful, complaining neighbours\r\nthat they had no heart for music or religion.\r\n\r\nThe wheel mentioned above was part of one of his tricycle schemes. His\r\nfirst attempt in cycle-making resulted in the construction of a bicycle\r\nthe wheels of which resembled the top of a round deal table; this soon\r\ncame to grief. His second endeavour was more successful and became a\r\ntricycle, the wheels of which were made of wrought iron and the base of\r\na triangular shape. Upon the large end he placed an arm-chair, averring\r\nthat it would be useful to rest in whenever he should grow weary! Then,\r\nmaking another attempt, he succeeded in turning out (being aided by\r\nanother person) a very respectable and useful tricycle upon which he\r\nmade many journeys to Barnstaple and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHowever, just as an end comes to everything that is mortal, so did an\r\nend come to our friend the clerk; for, as so many stories finish, he\r\ndied in a good old age, and his substitute reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\nThe following reminiscences of a parish clerk were sent by the Rev.\r\nAugustus G. Legge, who has since died.\r\n\r\nIt is reported of an enthusiastic archæologian that he blessed the day\r\nof the Commonwealth because, he said, if Cromwell and all his\r\ndestructive followers had never lived, there would have been no ruins in\r\nthe country to repay the antiquary's researches. And the converse of\r\nthis is true of a race of men who before long will be \"improved\" off the\r\nface of the earth, if the restoration of our parish churches is to go on\r\nat the present rate. I allude to the old parish clerks of our boy-hood\r\ndays. Who does not remember their quaint figures and quainter, though\r\nsomewhat irreverent, manner of leading the responses of the\r\ncongregation? It is well indeed that our churches, sadly given over to\r\nthe laxity and carelessness of a bygone age, should be renovated and\r\nbeautified, the tone of the services raised, and the \"bray\" of the old\r\nclerks, unsuited to the devotional feelings of a more enlightened day,\r\nsilenced, but still a shade of regret will be mingled with their\r\ndismissal, if only for the sake of the large stock of amusing anecdotes\r\nwhich their names recall.\r\n\r\nMy earliest recollections are connected with old Russell[93], my\r\nfather's clerk. He was a little man but possessed of a consequential\r\nmanner sufficient for a giant. A shoemaker by trade, his real element\r\nwas in the church. His conversation was embellished by high-flown\r\ngrandiloquence, and he invariably walked upon the heels of his boots.\r\nThis latter peculiarity, as may well be imagined, was the cause of a\r\nmost comical effect whenever he had occasion to leave his seat and\r\nclatter down the aisle of the church. How often when a boy did I make my\r\nold nurse's sides shake with laughter by imitating old Russell's walk!\r\nHis manner of reading the responses in the service can only be compared\r\nto a kind of bellow--as my father used to say, \"he bellowed like a\r\ncalf\"--and his rendering of parts of it was calculated to raise a smile\r\nupon the lips of the most devout. The following are a few instances of\r\nhis perversions of the text. \"Leviathan\" under his quaint manipulation\r\nbecame \"leather thing,\" his trade of shoemaker helping him, no doubt, to\r\nhis interpretation. Whether he had ever attended a fish-dinner at\r\nGreenwich and his mind had thus become impressed with the number and\r\nvariety of the inhabitants of the deep, history does not record, but, be\r\nthat as it may, \"Bring hither the tabret\" was invariably read as \"Bring\r\nhither the turbot.\" \"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego\" did service for\r\n\"Ananias, Azarias, and Misael\" in the \"Benedicite,\" and \"Destructions\r\nare come to a perpetual end\" was transmogrified into \"_parental_ end\" in\r\nthe ninth Psalm. My father once took the trouble to point out and try to\r\ncorrect some of his inaccuracies, but he never attempted it again. Old\r\nRussell listened attentively and respectfully, but when the lecture was\r\nover he dismissed the subject with a superior shake of the head and the\r\ndisdainful remark, \"Well, sir, I have heerd tell of people who think\r\nwith you.\" Never a bit though did he make any change in his own peculiar\r\nrendering of the Bible and Book of Common Prayer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: Old Russell, for many years clerk of the parish of East\r\nLavant in the county of Sussex.]\r\n\r\nThere was one occasion on which he especially distinguished himself, and\r\nI shall never forget it. A farmyard of six outbuildings abutted upon the\r\nchurch burial ground, and it was but natural that all the fowls should\r\nstray into it to feed and enjoy themselves in the grass. Amongst these\r\nwas a goodly flock of guinea-fowls, which oftentimes no little disturbed\r\nthe congregation by their peculiar cry of \"Come back! come back! come\r\nback!\" One Sunday the climax of annoyance was reached when the whole\r\nflock gathered around the west door just as my father was beginning to\r\nread the first lesson. His voice, never at any time very strong, was\r\ncompletely drowned. Whereupon old Russell hastily left his seat, book in\r\nhand, and clattering as usual on his heels down the aisle disappeared\r\nthrough the door on vengeance bent. The discomfiture of the offending\r\nfowls was instantly apparent by the change in their cry to one more\r\npiercing still as they fled away in terror. Then all was still, and\r\nback comes old Russell, a gleam of triumph on his face and somewhat out\r\nof breath, but nevertheless able without much difficulty to take up the\r\nresponses in the canticle which followed the lesson. Scarcely, however,\r\nhad the congregation resumed their seats for the reading of the second\r\nlesson when the offending flock again gathered round the west door, and\r\nagain, as if in defiant derision of Russell, raised their mocking cry of\r\n\"Come back! come back! come back!\" And back accordingly he went clatter,\r\nclatter down the aisle, a stern resolution flashing from his eye, and\r\ncausing the little boys as he passed to quail before him. Now it so\r\nhappened that the lesson was a short one, and, moreover, Russell took\r\nmore time, making a farther excursion into the churchyard than before,\r\nin order if possible to be rid entirely of the noisy intruders. Just as\r\nhe returned to the church door, this time completely breathless, the\r\nfirst verse of the canticle which followed was being read, but Russell\r\nwas equal to the occasion. All breathless as he was, without a moment's\r\nhesitation, he opened his book at the place and bellowed forth the\r\nresponses as he proceeded up the church to his seat. The scene may be\r\nimagined, but scarcely described: Russell's quaint little figure, the\r\nbroad-rimmed spectacles on his nose, the ponderous book in his hands,\r\nthe clatter of his heels, the choking gasps with which he bellowed out\r\nthe words as he laboured for breath, and finally the sudden\r\ndisappearance of the congregation beneath the shelter of their high pews\r\nwith a view to giving vent to their feelings unobserved--all this\r\nrequires to have been witnessed to be fully appreciated.\r\n\r\nIt chanced one Sunday that a parishioner coming into church after the\r\nservice had begun omitted to close the door, causing thereby an\r\nunseemly draught. My father directed Russell to shut it. Accordingly,\r\nbook in hand and with a thumb between the leaves to keep the place, he\r\nsallied forth. But, alas! in shutting the door the thumb fell out and\r\nthe place was lost, and after floundering about awhile to find, if\r\npossible, the proper response, he at length made known to the\r\ncongregation the misfortune which had befallen him by exclaiming aloud,\r\n\"I've lost my place or _summut_.\"\r\n\r\nA very amusing incident once took place at a baptism. The service\r\nproceeded with due decorum and regularity till my father demanded of the\r\ngodfather the child's name. The answer was so indistinctly given that he\r\nhad to repeat the question more than once, and even then the name\r\nremained a mystery. All he could make out was something which sounded\r\nlike \"Harmun,\" the godfather indignantly asserting the while that it was\r\na \"Scriptur\" name. In his perplexity my father turned to Russell with\r\nthe query: \"Clerk, do you know what the name is?\" \"No, sir. I'm sure I\r\ndon't know, unless it be he at the end of the prayer,\" meaning \"Amen.\"\r\nThe result was that the child was otherwise christened, and after the\r\nceremony was over my father, placing a Bible in the godfather's hands,\r\nrequested him to find the \"Scriptur\" name, as he called it, when, having\r\nturned over the leaves for some time, he drew his attention to _wicked\r\nHaman_. The child's escape, therefore, was most fortunate. Old Russell\r\nhas now slept with his fathers for many years, and the few stories which\r\nI have related about him do not by any means exhaust the list of his\r\noddities. Many of the parishioners to this day, no doubt, will call to\r\nmind the quaint way in which, if he thought any one was misbehaving\r\nhimself in church, he would rise slowly from his seat with such majesty\r\nas his diminutive stature could command, and shading his spectacles with\r\nhis hand, gaze sternly in the offending quarter; how on a certain\r\nCommunion Sunday he forgot the wine to be used in the sacred office, and\r\nwhen my father directed his attention to the omission, after sundry\r\ndives under the altar-cloth he at last produced a common rush basket,\r\nand from it a black bottle; how on another Sunday, being desirous to\r\nfree the church from smoke which had escaped from a refractory stove, he\r\ndeliberately mounted upon the altar and remained standing there while he\r\nopened a small lattice in the east window. All these circumstances will,\r\nno doubt, be recalled by some one or other in the parish. But, gentle\r\nreader, be not overharsh in passing judgment upon him. I verily believe\r\nthat he had no more desire to be irreverent than you or I have. The\r\nfault lay rather in the religious coldness and carelessness of those\r\ndays than in him. He was liked and respected by every one as a harmless,\r\ninoffensive, good-hearted old fellow, and I cannot better close this\r\nbrief account of some of his peculiarities than by saying--as I do with\r\nall my heart--Peace to his ashes!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Legge's baptismal story reminds me of a friend who was christening\r\nthe child of a gipsy, when the name given was \"Neptin.\" This puzzled him\r\nsorely, but suddenly recollecting that he had baptized another gipsy\r\nchild \"Britannia,\" without any hesitation he at once named the infant\r\n\"Neptune.\" Mr. Eagles was once puzzled when the sponsor gave the name\r\n\"Acts.\" \"'Acts!' said I. 'What do you mean?' Thinks I to myself, I will\r\n_ax_ the clerk to spell it. He did: A-C-T-S. So Acts was the babe, and\r\nwill be while in this life, and will be doubly, trebly so registered if\r\never he marries or dies. Afterwards, in the vestry, I asked the good\r\nwoman what made her choose such a name. Her answer _verbatim_: 'Why,\r\nsir, we be religious people; we've got your on 'em already, and they be\r\ncaal'd Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and so my husband thought we'd\r\ncompliment the apostles a bit.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Legge adds the following stories:\r\n\r\nMy first curacy was in Norfolk in the year 1858, a period when the old\r\nstyle of parish clerk had not disappeared. On one occasion I was asked\r\nby a friend in a neighbouring parish to take a funeral service for him.\r\nOn arriving at the church I was received by a very eccentric clerk. It\r\nseemed as if his legs were hung upon wires, and before the service began\r\nhe danced about the church in a most peculiar and laughable manner, and\r\nin addition to this he had a hideous squint, one eye looking north and\r\nthe other south. The service proceeded with due decorum until we arrived\r\nat the grave, when those who were preparing to lower the coffin in it\r\ndiscovered that it had not been dug large enough to receive it. This of\r\ncourse created a very awkward pause while it was made larger, and the\r\nchief mourner utilised it by gently remonstrating with the clerk for his\r\ncarelessness. In reply he gave a solemn shake of his head, cast one eye\r\ninto the grave and the other at the chief mourner, and merely remarked,\r\n\"Putty (pretty) nigh though,\" meaning that the offence after all was not\r\nso very great, as he had almost accomplished his task. Obliged to keep\r\nmy countenance, I had, as may be imagined, some difficulty.\r\n\r\nA very amusing incident once took place when I had a couple before me\r\nto be married. All went well until I asked the question, \"Who giveth\r\nthis woman to be married to this man?\" when an individual stepped\r\nforward, and snatching the ring out of the bride-groom's hand, began\r\nplacing it on a finger of the bride. As all was confusion I signed to\r\nthe old clerk to put matters straight. Attired in a brown coat and\r\nleather gaiters, with spectacles on his nose, and a large Prayer Book in\r\nhis hands, he came shuffling forward from the background, exclaiming out\r\nloud, \"Bless me, bless me! never knew such a thing happen afore in all\r\nmy life!\" The service was completed without any further interruption,\r\nbut again I had a sore difficulty in keeping my countenance.\r\n\r\nMany years ago ecclesiastical matters in Norfolk were in a very slack\r\nstate--rectors and vicars lived away from their parishes, subscribing\r\namongst them to pay the salary of a curate to undertake the church\r\nservices. As his duties were consequently manifold some parishes were\r\nwithout his presence on Sunday for a month and sometimes longer. The\r\nparish clerk would stand outside the church and watch for the coming\r\nparson, and if he saw him in the distance would immediately begin to\r\ntoll the bell; if not, the parish was without a service on that day.\r\n\r\nIt happened on one of these monthly occasions that on the arrival of the\r\nparson at the church he was met by the clerk at the door, who, pulling\r\nhis forelock, addressed him as follows: \"Sir, do yew mind a prachin in\r\nthe readin' desk to-day?\" \"Yes,\" was the reply; \"the pulpit is the\r\nproper place.\" \"Well, sir, you see we fare to have an old guse a-sittin'\r\nin the pulpit. She'll be arf her eggs to-morrow; 'twould be a shame to\r\ntake her arf to-day.\"\r\n\r\nThe pulpit was considered as convenient a place as any for the \"old\r\nguse\" to hatch her young in.\r\n\r\nCanon Venables contributes the following:\r\n\r\nThe first parish clerk I can in the least degree remember was certainly\r\nentitled to be regarded as a \"character,\" albeit not in all moral\r\nrespects what would be called a moral character. Shrewd, clever, and\r\nbetter informed than the inhabitants of his little village of some\r\neighty folk, he was not \"looked up to,\" but was regarded with suspicion,\r\nand, in short, was not popular, while treated with a certain amount of\r\ndeference, being a man of some knowledge and ability. The clergyman was\r\na man of excellent character, learned, a fluent _ex-tempore_ preacher,\r\nand one who liked the services to be nicely conducted. He came over\r\nevery Sunday and ministered two services. In those days the only organ\r\nwas a good long pitch-pipe constructed principally of wood and, I\r\nimagine, about twelve inches in length. But upon the parish clerk\r\ndevolved the onerous (and it may be added in this case sonorous) duty of\r\nstarting the hymn and the singing. In those days few could read, and the\r\nmethod was adopted (and I know successfully adopted a few years later)\r\nof announcing two lines of the verse to be sung, and sometimes the whole\r\nverse. But Mr. W.M. was unpopular, and people did not always manifest a\r\nwillingness to sing with him.\r\n\r\nAt last a crisis came. The hymn and psalm were announced. The pitch-pipe\r\nrightly adjusted gave the proper keynote, and the clerk essayed to sing.\r\nBut from some cause matters were not harmonious and none attempted to\r\nhelp the clerk.\r\n\r\nWith a scowl not worthy of a saint, the offended official turned round\r\nupon the congregation and closed all further attempts at psalm-singing\r\nby stating clearly and distinctly, \"I shan't sing if nobody don't\r\nfoller.\" This man was deposed ere long, and deservedly, if village\r\nsuspicions were truthful.\r\n\r\nAfter which, I think, he usually came just inside the church once every\r\nSunday, but never to get further than to take a seat close to the door.\r\nHe died at a great age. Two or three of his successors were worthy men.\r\nOne of them would carefully recite the Psalms for the coming Sunday\r\nwithin church or elsewhere during the week, and he read with proper\r\nfeeling and good sense.\r\n\r\nAnother of the same little parish, well up in his Bible, once helped the\r\nvery excellent clergyman at a baptism in a critical moment. \"Name this\r\nchild.\" \"Zulphur.\" This was not a correct name. Another effort,\r\n\"Sulphur.\" The clergyman was in difficulty. The clerk was equal to the\r\noccasion, for the parson was well up in his Bible too.\r\n\r\n\"Leah's handmaid,\" suggested the clerk. \"Zilpah, I baptize thee,\" said\r\nthe priest, and all was well.\r\n\r\nIn that church the few farmers who met to levy a poor-rate and do other\r\nparochial work insisted on doing so within the chancel rails, using the\r\nholy table as the writing-desk, and the assigned reason for so doing was\r\nthat, being apt to quarrel and dispute over parish matters, there would\r\nbe no danger _at such a place_ as this of using profane language. All in\r\nthe diocese of Oxford.\r\n\r\nIt was in the twenties that I must have seen old P.W. (the parish clerk)\r\nand two other men in the desk singing to \"Hanover,\" with a certain\r\napparent self-complacency in nice smock-frocks, \"My soul, praise the\r\nLord, speak good of His Name,\" etc. The little congregation listened\r\nwith seeming contentment, and it is worth recording that the parson\r\nalways preached in the surplice. I suppose Pusey was a boy at that time,\r\nbut the custom in this church was not a novelty, whether right or wrong.\r\n\r\nIt was not the clerk's fault that the hour of service was hastened by\r\nsome seventy minutes one afternoon, so that one or two invariably late\r\nworshippers were astounded to be driven backwards from the church by the\r\ncongregation returning from service. But so it was. The really\r\nwell-meaning kind-hearted parson was withal a keen sportsman and a\r\nworthy gentleman, and with his \"long dogs\" and man was on his horse and\r\naway for Illsley Downs race course to come off next day, and his dogs\r\n(they won) must not be fatigued. Old P.W., the clerk, reached a good\r\nage, an inoffensive man.\r\n\r\nI was rather interested when residing in my parish in grand old\r\nYorkshire to observe two steady-looking and rather elderly men, each\r\naided by a strong walking-stick, coming to church with praiseworthy\r\nregularity and reverence. I found, on making their acquaintance, that\r\nthey were brothers who had recently come into the parish, natives of\r\n\"the Peak,\" or of the locality near the Peak, which was not many miles\r\ndistant from my parish.\r\n\r\nSince I heard from their lips the story which I am about to relate, I\r\nhave heard it told, _mutatis mutandis_, as happening in sundry other\r\nparishes, until one rather doubts the genuineness of the record at all.\r\nBut as they recounted it it ran as follows, and I am sure they believed\r\nwhat they told me.\r\n\r\nSome malicious person or persons unknown entered the church, and having\r\nseized the rather large typed Prayer Book used by the clerk, who was\r\nsomewhat advanced in years, they observed that the words \"the righteous\r\nshall flourish like\" were the last words at the bottom of the page,\r\nwhereupon they altered the next words on the top of the following page,\r\nand which were \"the palm tree,\" into \"a green bay horse\"; and, the\r\nchange being carefully made, the result on the Sunday following was that\r\nthe well-meaning clerk, studiously uttering each word of his Prayer\r\nBook, found himself declaring very erroneous doctrine. \"Hulloa,\" cried\r\nhe; \"I must hearken back. This'll never do.\" Now I cannot call to mind\r\nthe name of the parish. It was not Chapel-in-the-Frith. Was it\r\nMottram-in-Longdendale? I really cannot remember. But these two old men\r\nasserted that thenceforward it became a saying, \"I must hearken back,\r\nlike the clerk of--.\"\r\n\r\nI recollect preaching one weekday night (and people would crowd the\r\nchurches on weekday evenings fifty years ago far more readily than they\r\ndo now) at some wild place in Lancashire or Yorkshire, I think\r\nLancashire. I was taken to see and stand upon a stepping stone outside\r\nthe church, and close against the south wall of the sacred edifice, upon\r\nwhich almost every Sunday the clerk, as the people were leaving church,\r\nascended and in a loud voice announced any matters concerning the parish\r\nwhich it appeared desirable to proclaim. In this way any intended sales\r\nwere made known, the loss of sheep or cattle on the moors was announced,\r\nand almost anything appertaining to the secular welfare of the\r\nparishioners was made public. I do not state this to criticise it. It\r\nwas in some degree a recognition of the charity which ought to realise\r\nthe sympathy in each other's welfare which we ought all to display. It\r\nwas in those primitive times and localities a specimen of the\r\nsimplicity and well-meant interest in the welfare of the neighbour as\r\nwell as of oneself, although perhaps the secular sometimes did much to\r\nextinguish the spiritual.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUNDAY MORNING]\r\n\r\nFew people now realise what a business it was to light up a church, say,\r\neighty years ago. But the worthy old clerk, in a wig bestowed on him by\r\nthe pious and aged patron, is hastening to illuminate his church with\r\nold-fashioned candles, in which he is aided not a little by his faithful\r\nwife, who, like Abraham's wife, regarded her husband as her lord and\r\nresponded to the name of Sarah. The good old man--and he was a good old\r\nman--was perhaps a little bit \"flustered and flurried,\" for the folk\r\nwere gathering within the sacred temple, and W.L. was anxious to\r\ncomplete his task of lighting the loft, or gallery. \"I say, Sally, hand\r\nus up a little taste of candle,\" cried her lord, and Sarah obeyed, and\r\nthe illumination was soon complete.\r\n\r\nBut, really, few men \"gave out\" or announced a hymn with truer and more\r\ntouching and devout feeling than did that old clerk. I am one of those\r\nwho do not think that all the changes in the ministration of Church\r\nservices are, after experience had, desirable. I think that in many\r\ninstances the lay clerk ought to have been instructed in the performance\r\nof his duties, to the profit of all concerned. And I deem that this\r\nproceeding would have been a far wiser proceeding than any substitution\r\nof the man or his function. There is ancient authority for a clerk or\r\nclerks. It is wise to secure work to be attended to in the functions of\r\ndivine service for as many laymen as possible, consistent with principle\r\nand propriety. W.L. was an old man when I saw him, but I can hear him\r\nnow as with a pathos quite touching and teaching, because done so\r\nsimply and naturally, he announced, singing:\r\n\r\n     \"Salvation, what a glorious theme,\r\n       How suited to our need.\r\n     The grace that rescues fallen man\r\n       Is wonderful indeed.\"\r\n\r\nAnd though he pronounced the last word but one as if spelt \"woonderful,\"\r\nI venture to say that the \"giving out\" of that verse by that aged clerk\r\nwith his venerable wig and with a voice trembling a little by age, but\r\nmore by natural emotion, was preferable to many modern modes of\r\nannouncing a hymn.\r\n\r\nIt was common to say \"Let us sing, to the praise and glory of God.\" It\r\nis common to be shocked, nowadays, by such an invitation. Are we as\r\nreverent now as then? Do we sing praises with understanding better? I\r\nthink it is not so.\r\n\r\nI knew a very respectable man, W.K., a tailor by trade, a well-conducted\r\nman, but who felt the importance of his office to an extent that made\r\nhim nervous, or (what is as bad) made him fancy he was nervous. The\r\nchurch was capacious, and the population over two thousand.\r\n\r\nA large three-decker, though the pulpit was at a right angle with the\r\nhuge prayer-desk and the clerk's citadel below, well stained and\r\nvarnished, formed an important portion of the furniture of the church,\r\nthe whole structure, as we were reminded by large letters above the\r\nchancel arch, having been \"Adorn'd and beautified 1814,\" the names of\r\nthe churchwardens being also recorded. This clerk was observed\r\nfrequently, during the service, to stoop down within his little \"pew\" as\r\nif to imbibe something. He was inquired of as to his strange proceeding,\r\nwhen he frankly stated that he felt the trials of his duties to be so\r\ngreat, that he always fortified himself with a little bottle containing\r\nsome gin and some water, to which bottle he made frequent appeals during\r\nthe often rather lengthy services. He had to proclaim the notices of\r\nvestry meetings of all kinds, as well as to give out the hymns; but what\r\nastonishes me is that he baptized many infants at their homes instead of\r\nthe most excellent vicar, when circumstances made it difficult for the\r\nreally good vicar to attend.\r\n\r\nI saw him, one first Sunday in Lent, stand up on the edge of his square\r\nbox or pew, and conduct a rather long consultation with the vicar, a\r\nvery spiritually minded, excellent man, upon which we were put through\r\nthe whole Commination Service which, though appointed for Ash Wednesday,\r\nwas wholly neglected until it lengthened out the Sunday morning of the\r\nfirst _in_ but not _of_ Lent, and having nothing to do with the forty\r\ndays of Lent.\r\n\r\nThe well-conducted man lived to a good age, and after his death a rather\r\ncostly stained glass window was erected to his memory under the active\r\ninfluence of a new vicar. When privately engaged in church he wore his\r\nusual silk hat, though not approving of any one so behaving.\r\n\r\nI recollect, in a large church in a large town, the clerk, arrayed\r\n(properly, I think) in a suitable black gown, giving out the hymn, in a\r\ntone to be regretted, but where the obvious remedy was not to dethrone\r\nthe clerk, but rather to have just suggested the propriety of reading\r\nthe entire verse, as well as of avoiding a tone lugubrious on\r\nthe occasion.\r\n\r\nIt was Easter Day, and the hymn quite appropriate, but not so\r\n_rendered_ as the clerk heavily and drearily announced:\r\n\r\n     \"The Lord is risen indeed,\r\n       And are the tidings true?\"\r\n\r\nas if there might exist a doubt about this glorious fact.\r\n\r\nPity that he did not enter into the spirit of the verse and add:\r\n\r\n     \"Yes! we beheld the Saviour bleed,\r\n       And saw Him rising too.\"\r\n\r\nWithin about ten miles nearer to Windsor Castle the clerk of a church in\r\nwhich not a few nobility usually worshipped, was altogether at fault in\r\nhis \"H's,\" as he exhorted the people to sing, \"The Heaster Im with the\r\nAllelujer, _h_et the _h_end of _h_every line.\" Other clerks may have\r\ndone the same. He did it, I know well.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole of my very imperfect ministry I have sought to\r\npractise catechising in church every Sunday afternoon, and very strongly\r\ndesire to urge the practice of it in every church every Sunday.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most difficult parts of the glorious ministry since the\r\ntime of St. Luke that can engage the attention of the ordained ministers\r\nof Christ's Church. It needs to be done well. It ought not to be a very\r\nnice, simple sermonette. This, though very beautiful, is not\r\ncatechising. Perhaps, if at once followed by questions upon the\r\nsermonette, it might thus become very useful. But a catechesis in which\r\nthe catechist simply tells a simple story or gives an amusing anecdote,\r\nor when questioning, so puts his inquiries that \"yes\" and \"no\" are the\r\nlistless replies that are drawn forth from the lads and girls, is not\r\ninteresting or profitable. Whenever I have the opportunity I go to an\r\nafternoon catechetical service. Some failed by being made into the time\r\nof a small preachment; some because in a few minutes the catechist\r\neasily asked questions and then answered them himself. Others were\r\nreally magnificent, securing the attention and drawing forth answers\r\nadmirably. Was it the great bishop Samuel Wilberforce who said, \"A boy\r\nmay preach, but it takes a man to catechise\"?\r\n\r\nI cannot boast of being a good catechist; but I know that catechising\r\ncosts me more mental exhaustion (alas! with sad depression under a sense\r\nof trial of temper and failure) than any sermon. But I will say to any\r\nclergyman, _My dear brother, catechise; try, persevere, keep on. It will\r\nnot be in vain. But secure an answer_. If need be, become a\r\ncross-examining advocate for Christ, and don't give up until you have\r\nmade the catechumens, by dint of a variety of ways of putting the\r\nquestion, give the answer you desired. You have made them think and call\r\nmemory into play, and made them feel that they \"knew it all the time,\"\r\nif only they had reflected. And you have given them a \"power of good.\"\r\n\r\nBut what has all this to do with a clerk? Well, I want to tell what made\r\nme _try_ to be a good catechist, and what makes me, over eighty-three\r\nyears of age, _still wish_ to become such, though the incident must have\r\nhappened some seventy years ago, for I recollect that on the very Sunday\r\nwe crossed the Greta my father whispered to me as we were on the bridge\r\nthat it was the poet Southey who was close to us, as he as well as our\r\nlittle family and a goodly congregation were returning from Crosthwaite\r\nChurch in the afternoon. For \"oncers\" were unknown in those times,\r\nneither by poets and historians like Southey, nor by travellers such as\r\nwe were. We had attended morning service. A stranger officiated. His\r\nname was _Bush_, and this is important. A family \"riddle\" impressed the\r\nname upon me. \"Why were we all like Moses to-day?\" \"We had heard the\r\nword out of a Bush,\" was the reply. But at the afternoon service I was\r\ndeeply impressed. The Rev. M. Bush having read the lessons, came out of\r\nthe prayer-desk, and to my amazement and great interest catechised the\r\nchildren and others.\r\n\r\nI thought to myself that the practice was excellent, and felt that if\r\never I became a clergyman (of which honour there was very small\r\nprobability), I would obey the Prayer Book and catechise. Since then I\r\nhave catechised ten, twenty, fifty young people, and not infrequently\r\nfive hundred to one thousand, and rarely two to three thousand on a\r\nSunday afternoon, often, however, much exhausted (having to preach in\r\nthe evening) and dreadfully cast down at my own failure in not\r\ncatechising better.\r\n\r\nDecades rolled on. A lovely effigy of Southey occupied his place in\r\nCrosthwaite Church, and I found myself again amidst the enchanting views\r\nof and about Derwentwater. The morning was wet, but I resolved to go as\r\nsoon as it cleared up in order to find \"th' ould clerk,\" and inquire of\r\nhim touching the catechising of perhaps forty years ago. I was told that\r\nhe had resigned, that he lived still at no very great distance. I think\r\nhe was succeeded by his son as clerk. After some trouble I found my aged\r\nfriend, and told him that very many years ago I was at the church when\r\nSouthey, the poet, was there, and I wanted to know if the catechising\r\nwas continued. \"There never has been any catechising here,\" said the\r\nworthy old sacristan. \"Forgive me, I heard it myself.\" \"I tell thee\r\nthere never was no catechising here. I lived here all these years, and\r\nwas clerk for nearly all the time.\" \"I cannot help that,\" I said; \"I am\r\nsure there was catechising in your church on a Sunday when I, a boy, was\r\nhere.\" The old Churchman became testy, and my pertinacity made him\r\nirate, as he thundered out that \"never had there been catechising in\r\nthat church in all his day.\" I rose to leave him, telling him that I was\r\nvery disappointed, but that I was _confident_ that I did not invent this\r\nstory, and, I added, the name of the parson was Bush. \"_Bush, Bush,\r\nBush!_ Well, there was a clergyman of that name come here four Sundays,\r\nmany a year ago, when the vicar was from home; and now I come to think\r\nof it, he did catechise on the Sunday afternoon. But he is the only man\r\nthat ever did so here. There's been no catechising in this church,\r\nexcept then.\" We parted good friends after what I felt to be a most\r\nsingular interview, far more interesting, I fear, to me than to any who\r\nmay read this unadorned tale, and especially the many folks who probably\r\nbut for this I should never have catechised.\r\n\r\nBut I hope the old clerk of Crosthwaite's declaration will not long be\r\ntrue of any church of the Anglican Communion, \"There's been no\r\ncatechising here.\" My success as a preacher, or catechist, or parish\r\npriest has not been great, but this does not greatly surprise me, while\r\nsorrowing that so it has been. But I think it likely that the incident\r\nat Crosthwaite Church was a chief cause of my trying to be a catechist,\r\nand I conclude by saying to any one in holy orders, or preparing to\r\nreceive them. Make catechising an important effort in your ministry.\r\n\r\nIt was a small parish. The vicar was a learned man, and an authority as\r\nan antiquary, and a man of high character. On a certain Sunday morning\r\nI was detailed to perform all the \"duties\" of Morning Prayer. Doubtless\r\nI was too energetic in my efforts at preaching, for my \"action\" proved,\r\nalmost to an alarming extent, that the huge pulpit cushion had not been\r\n\"dusted\" for a lengthy period. But it was at the very commencement of\r\ndivine service that the clerk demonstrated his originality in the proper\r\ndischarge of his duties. \"I stands up in yonder corner to ring the\r\nbells, and as soon as you be ready you gives me a kind of nod like, and\r\nthen I leaves off ringing and comes to my place as clerk.\" Nothing could\r\nwork better, and the clerk of B----- d and I parted at the close of\r\ndivine service on very amicable terms.\r\n\r\nMr. F.S. Gill, aged 86, has many recollections of old clerks and their\r\nways. In a parish in Nottinghamshire there was an old clerk who was\r\nnearly blind. There were two services on Sunday in summer, and only\r\nmorning service in winter. The clerk knew the morning Psalms quite well\r\nby heart, but not so the evening Psalms. On one occasion when his verse\r\nshould have been read, he was unable to recollect it. After a pause the\r\nclergyman began to read it, when the clerk, who occupied the box below\r\nthat of the vicar, looked up, saying, \"Nay, nay, master, I've got\r\nit now.\"\r\n\r\nAnother time, when an absent-minded curate omitted the ante-Communion\r\nservice and appeared in his black gown in the pulpit, the clerk was\r\nindignant, and went up to remonstrate. Knocking at the pulpit door and\r\nno notice being taken of him, he proceeded to pull the black gown, and\r\nmade the curate come down, change his robes, and complete the service in\r\nthe orthodox fashion.\r\n\r\nIn another Notts church, during service, there was an encounter between\r\ntwo clerks. The regular clerk having been taken ill was unequal to his\r\nduties for some weeks, and appointed a man to carry them out for him. On\r\nthe restoration to health of the real clerk he came into church to\r\nresume his duties, but found the man he had appointed occupying the\r\nbox--the so-called desk. Whereupon they had a scuffle in the aisle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Rev. William Selwyn recollects the following incidents in the parish\r\nof F-----, near Cambridge:\r\n\r\nHere up to the end of the sixties and well into the seventies a most\r\nquaint service was in fashion. The morning service began with a metrical\r\nPsalm--Tate and Brady--led by the clerk (of these more hereafter). This\r\nbeing ended, the vicar commenced the service always with the sentence \"O\r\nLord, correct me\"--never any other. Then all things went on in the\r\nregular course till the end of the Litany, when the clerk would be heard\r\nstamping down the church and ascending the gallery in order to be ready\r\nfor the second metrical Psalm. That ended, the vicar would commence with\r\nthe ante-Communion service from the _reading-desk_. This went on in due\r\ncourse till the end of the Nicene Creed, when without sermon, prayers,\r\nor blessing, the morning service came to an abrupt termination. The\r\nafternoon service was identical, save that it ended with a sermon and\r\nthe blessing.\r\n\r\nBut the chief peculiarity was the clerk and the singing. The metrical\r\nPsalm chosen was invariably one for the day of the month whatever it\r\nmight be. The clerk would give it out, \"Let's sing to the praise and\r\nglory of God,\" and then would read the first two lines. The usual\r\nvillage band--fiddle, trombone, etc. etc.--would accompany him, which\r\nthing done, the next two lines would follow, and so on. Usually the\r\nnumber of verses was four, but sometimes the clerk would go on to six,\r\nor even seven. Once, I remember, this led to a somewhat ludicrous\r\nresult. It was the seventh day of the month, consequently the\r\nthirty-fifth was the metrical Psalm to be sung. I think my late revered\r\nrelative, Canon Selwyn, learnt then with astonishment, as I did myself,\r\nof the existence of the following lines within the folds of the\r\nPrayer Book:\r\n\r\n     \"And when through dark and slippery ways\r\n       They strive His rage to shun,\r\n     His vengeful ministers of wrath\r\n       Shall goad them as they run.\"\r\n\r\nIt is hard to think that such a service could have been possible within\r\nseven miles of a University town, and I need hardly say it was very\r\ntrying to the younger ones.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the band migrated to the dissenting chapel. On one\r\noccasion the band failed to appear, and the clerk was left alone.\r\nHowever, he made the best of it, with scant support from the\r\ncongregation, so turning to them at the end, said in a loud voice,\r\n\"Thank you for your help!\"\r\n\r\nTHE PARISH OF BROMFIELD, SALOP.\r\n\r\nFrom these ludicrous scenes it is refreshing to turn to a service which,\r\nthough primitive, was conducted with the utmost reverence and decency.\r\nWhen I was instituted in 1866 all the singing was conducted, and most\r\nreverently conducted, under the auspices of the clerk. He was a handsome\r\nman, with a flowing beard, magnificent bass voice, and a wooden leg.\r\nWith two or three sons, daughters, and others in the village he\r\ncarried on the choir, and though there were only hymns, nothing could be\r\nbetter. Of its kind I have seldom heard anything better. They had to\r\nyield to the inexorable march of time, but I parted from them with\r\nregret. Though we now have a surpliced choir of men and boys, with a\r\ntrained organist and choirmaster, I always look back to my good old\r\nfriend with his daughters and their companions, who were the leaders of\r\nthe singing in the early days of my incumbency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PARISH CLERK OF QUEDGELEY]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Canon Hemmans tell his reminiscences of Thomas Evison, parish\r\nclerk of Wragby, Lincolnshire, who died in 1865, aged eighty-two years.\r\nHe speaks of him as \"a dear old friend, for whom I had a profound\r\nregard, and to whom I was grateful for much help during my noviciate at\r\nmy first and only curacy.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Evison was a shoemaker, and in his early years a great pot-house\r\norator. Settled on his well-known corner seat in the \"Red Lion,\" he\r\nwould be seen each evening smoking his pipe and laying down the law in\r\nthe character of the village oracle. He must have had some determination\r\nand force of character, as one evening he laid down his pipe on the hob\r\nand said, \"I'll smoke no more.\" He also retired from his corner seat at\r\nthe inn, but he was true to his political opinions, and remained an\r\nardent Radical to the last. This action showed some courage, as almost\r\nall the parish belonged to the squire, who was a strong Tory of the old\r\nschool. Canon Hemmans was curate of Wragby with the Rev. G.B. Yard from\r\n1851 to 1860, succeeding the present Dean of St. Paul's. Mr. Yard was a\r\nHigh Churchman, a personal friend of Manning, the Wilberforces, R.\r\nSibthorpe, and Keble, and when expounding then unaccustomed and\r\nforgotten truths, he found the clerk a most intelligent and attentive\r\nhearer. Evison used to attend the daily services, except the Wednesday\r\nand Friday Litany, which service was too short for him. During the\r\nvicar's absence Canon Hemmans, who was then a deacon, found the clerk a\r\nmost reliable adviser and instructor in Lincolnshire customs and words\r\nand ways of thought. When he was baptizing a child privately, the name\r\nThirza was given to the child, which he did not recognise as a Bible\r\nname. He consulted Evison, who said, \"Oh, yes, it is so; it's the name\r\nof Abel's wife.\" On the next day Evison bought a book, Gesner's _Death\r\nof Abel_, a translation of some Swedish or German work, in which the\r\ntragedy of the early chapters of Genesis is woven into a story with\r\npious reflections. This is not an uncommon book, and the clerk said\r\nthese people believed it was as true as the Bible, because it claimed to\r\nbe about Bible characters.\r\n\r\nEvison was a diligent reader of newspapers, which were much fewer in his\r\nday, and studied diligently the sermons reported in the local Press. He\r\nwas much puzzled by the reference to \"the leg end\" of the story of the\r\nraising of Lazarus in a sermon preached by the Bishop of London,\r\nafterwards Archbishop Tait. A reference to Bailey's Dictionary and the\r\nfinding of the word _legend_ made matters clear. Of course he miscalled\r\nwords. During the Russian War he told Mr. Hemmans that we were not\r\nfighting for \"territororial possessions,\" and he always read \"Moabites\r\nand Hungarians\" in his rendering of the sixth verse of the 83rd Psalm.\r\n\r\nAfter the resignation of Mr. Yard in 1859 a Low Churchman was\r\nappointed, who restored the use of the black gown. Mr. Hemmans had to\r\npreach in the evening of the first Sunday, and was undecided as to\r\nwhether he ought to continue to use the surplice. He consulted Evison,\r\nwhose brave advice was, \"Stick to your colours.\"\r\n\r\nThe clerk stuck stoutly to his Radical principles, and one day went to\r\nLincoln to take part in a contested election. On the following Sunday\r\nthe vicar spoke of \"the filthy stream of politics.\" The old man was\r\nrather moved by this, and said afterwards, \"Well, I am not too old to\r\nlearn.\" Though staunch to his own principles, he was evidently\r\nconsiderate towards the opinions of others. He used to keep a pony and\r\ngig, and his foreman, one Solomon Bingham, was a local preacher. When\r\nthere came a rough Sunday morning the kind old clerk would say: \"Well,\r\nSolomon, where are you going to seminate your schism to-day? You may\r\nhave my trap.\" Canon Hemmans retains a very affectionate regard for the\r\nmemory of the old clerk.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. Ellen M. Burrows sends me a charming description of an\r\nold-fashioned service, and some clerkly manners which are worth\r\nrecording.\r\n\r\nFrom twenty-five to thirty years ago the small Bedfordshire village of\r\nTingrith had quaint customs and ceremonies which to-day exist only in\r\nthe memory of the few.\r\n\r\nThe lady of the manor was perhaps best described by a neighbouring\r\nsquire as a \"potentate in petticoats.\"\r\n\r\nBeing sole owner of the village, she found employment for all the men,\r\nenforced cleanliness on all the women, greatly encouraged the industry\r\nof lace-making and hat-sewing, paid for the schooling of the children,\r\nand looked after the morals of everybody generally.\r\n\r\nLegend has it that one ancient schoolmaster whom this good lady\r\nappointed was not overgood at spelling, and would allow a pupil to\r\nlaboriously spell out a word and wait for him to explain. If the master\r\ncould not do this he would pretend to be preoccupied, and advise the\r\npupil to \"say 'wheelbarrow' and go on.\"\r\n\r\nOn a Sunday each and every cottager was expected at church. The women\r\nsat on one side of the centre aisle and the men on the other, the former\r\nattired in clean cotton gowns and the latter in their Sunday smocks.\r\n\r\nThe three bells were clanged inharmoniously until a boy who was\r\nstationed at a point of vantage told the ringer \"she's a-comin'.\" Then\r\none bell only was rung to announce the near arrival of the lady of\r\nthe manor.\r\n\r\nThe rector would take his place at the desk, and the occupants of the\r\ncentre aisle would rise respectfully to their feet in anticipation.\r\n\r\nA white-haired butler and a younger footman--with many brass buttons on\r\ntheir coat-tails--would fling wide the double doors and stand one on\r\neither side until the old lady swept in; then one door was closed and\r\nthe other only left open for less-important worshippers to enter. As she\r\npassed between the men and women to the big pew joining the chancel\r\nscreen, they all touched their forelocks or dropped curtsies before\r\nresuming their seats. Before this aristocratic personage began her\r\ndevotions she would face round and with the aid of a large monocle,\r\nwhich hung round her neck on a broad black ribbon, would make a silent\r\ncall over, and for the tardy, or non-arrivals, there was a lecture in\r\nstore. The servants of her household had the whole of one side aisle\r\nallotted to their use. The farmers had the other. There were two\r\n\"strangers' pews,\" two \"christening pews,\" and the rest were for the\r\nchildren. When a hymn was given out the schoolmaster would vigorously\r\napply a tuning-fork to his knee, and having thus got the key would start\r\nthe tune, which was taken up lustily by the children round him. This was\r\nall the singing they had in the service. The clerk said all the amens\r\nexcept when he was asleep. The rector was never known to preach more\r\nthan ten minutes at a time, and this was always so simple an exposition\r\nof the Scripture that the most illiterate could understand.\r\n\r\nBut no pen can pay tribute enough to the sweet earnestness of those\r\nlittle sermons, or, having heard them, ever go away unimpressed.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the service no one of the congregation moved until the\r\nlady of the manor sailed out of the great square pew. Then the men and\r\nwomen rose as before and bowed and bobbed as she passed down the aisle.\r\nThe two menservants again flung wide the double doors and stood stiffly\r\non either side as she passed out; then sedately walked home behind her\r\nat a respectful distance.\r\n\r\nOn each Good Friday the male community of the villagers were given a\r\nholiday from their work, and a shilling was the reward for every man who\r\nmade his appearance at the eleven o'clock service; needless to say, it\r\nwas well attended.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother church (Newport Pagnell, Bucks) in an adjoining county--probably\r\nsome years previous to this date--was lighted by tallow candles stuck in\r\ntin sconces on the walls, and twice during the service the clerk went\r\nround with a pair of long-handled snuffers to \"smitch,\" as he called\r\nit, the wicks of these evil-smelling lights.\r\n\r\nFor his own better accommodation he had a candle all to himself stuck in\r\na bottle, which he lighted when about to sing a hymn, and with candle in\r\none hand and book in the other, and both held at arm's length, he would\r\nbellow most lustily and with reason, for he was supposed to lead the\r\nsinging. This finished he would blow out his candle with most audible\r\nvigour, and every one in his neighbourhood would have their\r\nhandkerchiefs ready to drop their noses into.\r\n\r\nThis same clerk also took up his stand by the chancel steps with a black\r\nrod in his hand, and with tremendous importance marched in front of the\r\nrector down the aisle to the vestry under the belfry, and waited outside\r\nwhile the clergyman changed his surplice for a black cassock, then\r\nescorted him again to the pulpit stairs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Rev. E.H.L. Reeve, rector of Stondon Massey, Essex, contributes the\r\nfollowing excellent stories of old-time services.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Thomas Wallace was rector of Listen, in Essex, from 1783, the\r\ndate of his father's death, onward. The following story is well\r\nauthenticated in the annals of the family, and must belong to the latter\r\npart of the eighteenth century or the commencement of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, a well-established custom in those old times for the\r\nchurch clerk to give out the number of the hymn to be sung, which he did\r\nwith much unction and long preamble. The moments thus employed would be\r\nturned to account in the afternoon by the officiating clergyman, who\r\nwould take the opportunity of retiring to the vestry to exchange his\r\nsurplice for his academic gown wherein to preach.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion Mr. Wallace left his sermon, through inadvertence, at\r\nhome; and, finding himself in the vestry, considered, perhaps, that the\r\nchance of escape was too good to be lost. At any rate, he let himself\r\nout into the churchyard, and returned no more! He may possibly have been\r\nunable to find a discourse, but these are details with which we are not\r\nconcerned. The clerk and congregation with becoming loyalty lengthened\r\nout the already dreary hymn by sundry additions and doxologies to give\r\ntheir pastor time to don his robes, and it was long ere they perceived\r\nthe true cause of his delay. They were somewhat nettled, as one may\r\nsuppose, at being thus befooled, and here lies the gist of our story.\r\nNext Sunday the clerk did not give out the second hymn at the usual\r\ntime, but waited in solemn silence till Mr. Wallace had returned in his\r\nblack gown from the vestry and ascended the pulpit stairs. Then, and not\r\ntill then, he closed the pulpit door with a slam; and, _keeping his back\r\nagainst it_, called out significantly, and with a tone of exultation in\r\nhis voice, \"We've got him, my boys; _now_ let us sing to the praise and\r\nglory of God,\" etc.\r\n\r\nWilliam Wren held the office of church clerk at Stondon Massey in Essex\r\nfor thirty-six years, from 1853 to 1889. He was a rough, uneducated man,\r\nbut with a certain amount of native talent which raised him above the\r\nlevel of the majority of his class. I can see him now in his place\r\nSunday after Sunday, rigged out in a suit of my father's cast-off\r\nclerical garments--a kind of \"set-off\" to him at the lower end of the\r\nchurch. In his earlier days Wren had played a flute in the village\r\ninstrumental choir, and to the last he might be heard whiling away\r\nspare moments on a Sunday in the church (for he brought his dinner early\r\nin the morning and bivouacked there all day!) recalling to himself the\r\ndeparted glories of ancient time. He turned the handle of the barrel\r\norgan in the west gallery from the time of its purchase in 1850 to that\r\nof its disappearance in 1873, but I do not think that he ever\r\nappreciated this rude substitution of mechanical art for cornet,\r\ndulcimer, and pipe.\r\n\r\nHe led the hymns and read the Psalms, and repeated the responses with\r\nmuch fervour; perpetuating (long after it had ceased to be correct) the\r\nidea that he alone could be relied upon. Should the preacher\r\ninadvertently close his discourse with the sacred name either as part of\r\na text or otherwise, a fervent \"Amun\" was certain to resound through the\r\nbuilding, either because long custom had led him to regard the appendage\r\nas indispensable to it, or because like an old soldier suddenly roused\r\nto \"attention,\" he awoke from a stolen slumber to jerk himself into the\r\nmental attitude most familiar to him. This last supposition, however, is\r\na libel upon his fair character. I cannot believe that Wren ever slept\r\non duty. He kept near to him a long hazel stick, wherewith to overawe\r\nany of the younger members of the congregation who were inclined either\r\nto speak or titter. On Wednesdays and Fridays in Lent, when the school\r\nattended morning service, and, in the absence of older people, occupied\r\nthe principal seats instead of their Sunday places in the gallery,\r\nWren's rod was frequently called into active play, and I have heard the\r\nstick resound on the luckless head of many an offending culprit.\r\n\r\nLet me give one closing story of him on one of those weekday mornings.\r\n\r\nIt was St. John the Evangelist's Day, and a few of us met at church for\r\nmatins. It was thought well to introduce a hymn for the festival (our\r\nhymn book in those days was Mercer's Church Psalter and Hymn Book) and\r\nWren was to take charge, as usual, of the barrel-organ. My father gave\r\nout hymn 292 at the appointed place, but only silence followed. Again\r\n\"292,\" and then came a voice from the west gallery, \"The 283rd!\" My\r\nfather did not take the hint, and again, rather unfortunately, hazarded\r\n\"Hymn 292.\" This was too much for our organist, who called in still\r\nlouder tones, \"'Tis the 283rd I tell you!\" Fortunately, we were a small\r\ncompany, but matters would have been the same, I dare say, on a Sunday.\r\n\r\nIn the vestry subsequently Wren explained to my father, \"You know there\r\nare _two Johns_; the 292nd hymn belongs to John the _Baptist's_ Day;\r\n_this_ is John the _Evangelist's_.\"\r\n\r\nThe confusion once over my father was much amused with the incident, and\r\nfrequently entertained friends with it afterwards, when I am bound to\r\nsay it did not lose its richness of detail. \"Don't I keep a-telling on\r\nyou?\" was the fully developed question, as I last remember hearing the\r\nstory told. The above, however, I can vouch for as strictly correct,\r\nbeing one of the select party privileged to witness the occurrence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Frederick W. Hackwood, the historian of Wednesbury, has kindly sent\r\nthe following description of the famous clerks of that place:\r\n\r\nThe office of parish clerk in Wednesbury has been held by at least two\r\nremarkable characters. \"Old George Court,\" as he was called--and by some\r\nwho are still alive--held the post in succession to his grandfather for\r\na great number of years. His grandfather was George Watkins, in his time\r\none of the principal tradesmen in the town. His hospitable house was the\r\nplace of entertainment for a long succession of curates-in-charge and\r\nother officiating ministers for all the long years that the vicar (Rev.\r\nA. Bunn Haden) was a non-resident pluralist. But the position created by\r\nthis state of things was remarkable. Watkins and the small coterie who\r\nacted with him became the absolute and dominant authority in all\r\nparochial matters. One curate complained of him and his nominee wardens\r\n(in 1806) that \"these men had been so long in office, and had become so\r\ncruel and oppressive,\" that some of the parishioners resolved at last to\r\ndismiss them. The little oligarchy, however, was too strong to be ousted\r\nat any vestry that ever was called. As to the elected officials, the\r\nsame curate records in a pamphlet which he published in his indignation,\r\nthat \"on Christmas Day, during divine service, the churchwardens entered\r\nthe workhouse with constables and bailiffs, and a multitude of men\r\nequally pious with themselves, and turned the governor and his wife into\r\nthe snow-covered streets.\" Another measure of iniquity laid to their\r\ncharge was their \"cruelty to Mr. Foster,\" the master of the charity\r\nschool held in the old Market Cross, \"a man of amiable disposition, and\r\na teacher of considerable merit.\" These aggressive wardens grazed the\r\nchurchyard for profit, looked coldly upon a proposal to put up Tables of\r\nBenefactions in the church, and altogether acted in a manner so\r\nhigh-handed as to call forth this historic protest. Although the fabric\r\nof the church was in so ruinous a condition that the rain streamed\r\nthrough the roof upon the head of our clerical pamphleteer as he was\r\npreaching, all these complaints were to no purpose. When the absentee\r\nvicar was appealed to he declared his helplessness, and one sentence in\r\nhis reply is significant; it was thus: \"It is as much as my life is\r\nworth to come among them!\" Allowance must be made for party rancour. It\r\nis probable that Watkins was but the official figure-head of this\r\ndominant party, and he is said to have been a man of real piety; and\r\nafter holding the office of parish clerk for sixty years, he at last\r\ndied in the vestry of the church he loved so much.\r\n\r\nAs a certified clerk George Court held the office as long as his\r\ngrandfather before him. He was a man of the bluff and hearty sort,\r\nthoroughly typical of old Wednesbury, of Dutch build, yet commanding\r\npresence, in language more forcible than polite, and not restrained in\r\nthe use of his strong language even by the presence of an austere and\r\niron-willed vicar. The tales told of him are numerous enough, but are\r\nscarcely of the kind that look well in cold print. Although fond of the\r\ngood things of this world himself, he could occasionally be very severe\r\non the high feeding and deep drinking proclivities of \"You--singers and\r\nringers\"! He was never known to fail in scolding any funeral procession\r\nthat had kept him waiting at the church gates too long, and that in\r\nlanguage as loud as it was vigorous. He, like his predecessor, was the\r\nautocrat of the parish.\r\n\r\nThe last of the long line of parish clerks who occupied the bottom desk\r\nof the fine old Jacobean three-decker was Thomas Parkes. He died in\r\n1884. The peculiar resonant nasal twang with which he sang out the\r\n\"Amens\" gave rise to a sharp newspaper correspondence in the _Wednesbury\r\nObserver_ of 1857. Another controversy provoked by him was at the\r\nopening of the cemetery in 1868, when as vestry clerk he claimed a fee\r\nof 9 d. on every interment. The resistance of the Nonconformists led to\r\nan amicable compromise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Wise, of Weekley, the author of several works on Kettering and the\r\nneighbourhood, tells me of an extraordinary incident which happened in a\r\nSussex parish church when he was a boy about seventy years ago. The\r\nclerk was a decayed farmer who had a fine voice, but who was noted for\r\nhis intemperate habits. He went up as usual to the singers' gallery just\r\nbefore the sermon and gave out the metrical Psalm. The Psalm was sung,\r\nthe sermon commenced, when suddenly from the gallery rose the words of a\r\npopular song, given by a splendid tenor voice:\r\n\r\n     \"Oh, give my back my Arab steed,\r\n     My Prince defends his right,\r\n     And I will  ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Some one, please, remove that drunken man from the gallery,\" the\r\nclergyman quietly said. It was afterwards found that some mischievous\r\npersons had promised the clerk a gallon of ale if he would sing a song\r\nduring the sermon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Elton, of Bath, tells me of the clerk of Bierton, near Aylesbury,\r\nof which her father had sole charge for a time at the end of the\r\nforties. His predecessor had been a Mr. Stephens. The place had been\r\nneglected, and church matters were at a low ebb. Mr. Elton instituted a\r\nservice on Saints' Days, which was quite an innovation at that time, and\r\nthe first of these was held on St. Stephen's Day. The old clerk came\r\ninto the vestry after the service and said, \"I be sorry, sir, to hear\r\nthe unkid (= awful) tale of poor Mussar (Mister) Stephens. He be come\r\nto a sad end surely.\" He had evidently confounded the first martyr, St.\r\nStephen, with the late curate of the parish, having apparently never\r\nheard of the former.\r\n\r\nA new vicar had been appointed to a parish about eight miles from\r\nOxford, who had been for many years a Fellow of his college, and in\r\nconsequence knew little of village folk or parochial matters. Dr. A. was\r\nmuch disturbed to find that so few of the villagers attended church, and\r\nconsulted the clerk on the subject, who suggested that it might\r\nencourage the people to attend if Dr. A. was to offer to give sixpence a\r\nSunday to all who came to church. The plan was tried and found to\r\nsucceed; the congregations improved rapidly, and the church was well\r\nfilled, to Dr. A.'s satisfaction. But after a while the numbers fell\r\noff, and to Dr. A.'s chagrin people left off attending church. He again\r\ncalled the clerk into his counsels, and asked what could be the reason\r\nof the falling off of the congregation, as he had always given sixpence\r\nevery Sunday, as he promised, to all who came to the service. \"Well,\r\nsir,\" said the clerk, \"it is like this: they tells me as how they finds\r\nthey _can't do it for the money_.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following reminiscences are supplied by the Rev. W. Frederick Green,\r\nand are worthy of record:\r\n\r\nI well remember the parish clerk of Woburn, in Bedfordshire, more than\r\nsixty years ago. His name was Joe Brewer--a bald-headed, short, stumpy\r\nman, who wore black knee-breeches, grey stockings, and shoes. He was\r\nalso the town crier. He always gave out the hymns from the front of the\r\nwest gallery. \"Let us sing to the praise and glory of God, hymn--\" Once\r\nI heard him call out instead, \"O yes! O yes! O yes! This is to give\r\nnotice,\" and then, recollecting he was in church, with a loud \"O\r\ncrikey!\" he began \"Let us sing,\" etc.\r\n\r\nCollections in church were made by him in a china soup plate from each\r\npew. Ours was a large square family pew. One Sunday my brother put into\r\nthe plate a new coin (I think a florin), which Brewer had never seen\r\nbefore, and which he thought was a token or medal, and thinking my\r\nbrother was playing a trick upon him, said in a loud voice, \"Now, Master\r\nCharles, none of them larks here.\"\r\n\r\nI have also seen him at afternoon service (there was no evening service\r\nin those days), when it unexpectedly came on too dark for the clergyman\r\nto see his MS. in the pulpit, go to the altar--an ordinary table with\r\ndrawers--throw up the cloth, open a drawer, take out two candles and a\r\nbox of matches, go up the pulpit stairs, fix them in the candlesticks,\r\nand light them.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter months part of his duty was to tend the fire during\r\nservice in the Duke of Bedford's large curtained, carpeted pew in\r\nthe chancel.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy I was staying in Northamptonshire, and went one Sunday\r\nmorning into a village church for service (I think it was Fotheringhay).\r\nThere was a three-decker, and the clerk from his desk led the singing of\r\nthe congregation, which he faced. There was no musical instrument of any\r\nkind. The hymn, which of course was from Tate and Brady, was the\r\nmetrical version of Psalm xlii. The clerk gave out the Psalm, then read\r\nthe first line to the congregation, then sang it solo, and then the\r\ncongregation sang it altogether; and so on line after line for the whole\r\neleven verses.\r\n\r\nMore attention must have been paid in those days to the requirement of\r\nthe ninety-first Canon, that the clerk should be known, if may be, \"for\r\nhis competent skill in singing.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1873 I was curate-in-charge of an out-of-the-way Norfolk village. On\r\nmy first Sunday I had an early celebration at 8 a.m. I arrived in church\r\nabout 7.45, and to my amazement saw five old men sitting round the stove\r\nin the nave with their hats on, smoking their pipes. I expostulated with\r\nthem quite gently, but they left the church before service and never\r\ncame again. I discovered afterwards that they had been regular\r\ncommunicants, and that my predecessor always distributed the offertory\r\nto the poor present immediately after the service. When these men in the\r\ncourse of my remonstrance found that I was not going to continue the\r\ncustom, they no longer cared to be communicants.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, in Norfolk, I went round with the rural dean visiting the\r\nchurches. At one church the only person to receive the rural dean was\r\nthe parish clerk, who was ready with the funeral pall to put over the\r\nrural dean's horse whilst waiting outside the church.\r\n\r\nIt was this same church which, in preparation for the rural dean's\r\nvisit, had been recently and completely whitewashed throughout. Not only\r\nthe walls and pillars, but also the pews, the school forms, the pulpit,\r\nand also the altar itself, a very small four-legged deal table without\r\nany covering. I suppose this was done by the churchwardens to conceal\r\nthe dilapidated condition of everything; but they had omitted to remove\r\nthe grass which was growing in the crevices of the floor paving.\r\n\r\nMr. Moxon (deceased), formerly rector of Hethersett, in Norfolk, told me\r\nthat he had once preached for a friend in a Norfolk village church with\r\nthe woman clerk holding an umbrella over his head in the pulpit\r\nthroughout the sermon, because of the \"dreep.\"\r\n\r\nMiss E. Lloyd, of Woodburn, Crowborough, writes:\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1833 a gentleman bought an estate in North Yorkshire,\r\nseven miles from any town, and built a house there. The parish was\r\nsmall, having a population of about a hundred souls, the church old and\r\ntumbledown, reeking with damp; the rain came through the roof; the seats\r\nwere worm-eaten, and centipedes, with other like vermin, roamed about\r\nthem near the wall. The vicar was non-resident, and an elderly\r\ncurate-in-charge ministered to this parish and another in the\r\nneighbourhood. The customs of the church were much the same as those\r\ndescribed by Canon Atkinson in his _Forty Years in a Moorland Parish_ as\r\nexisting on his arrival at Danby. There was no vestry. The surplice\r\n(washed twice a year) was hung over the altar rails, within which the\r\ncurate robed, his hat or any parcel he happened to have in his hand\r\nbeing put down for the time on the Holy Table. The men sat for the most\r\npart together, the farmers and young men in the singing-loft, the\r\nlabourers below, and the women in front. The wife of the chief yeoman\r\nfarmer--an excellent and superior woman--still kept up the habit of\r\n\"making a reverence\" to the altar before she entered her pew. The\r\nsurplice, which hung in the church all through the week, was apt to get\r\nvery damp. On one occasion, when a strange clergyman staying at the Hall\r\ntook the service, he declined to wear it, as it was so wet.\r\n\r\n\"He wadn't pit it on,\" said the old clerk Christopher (commonly called\r\n\"Kitty\") Hill. \"I reckon he was afeard o' t' smittle\" (infection).\r\n\r\nThe same clergyman, when he went up to the altar for the Communion\r\nService, knelt down, as his habit was, at the north end for private\r\nprayer whilst the congregation were singing a metrical Psalm (Old or New\r\nVersion). On looking up he saw that Kitty Hill had followed him within\r\nthe rails and was kneeling at the opposite end of the Holy Table staring\r\nat him with round eyes full of amazement at this unusual act of\r\ndevotion. Both the curate and the clerk spoke the broadest Yorkshire.\r\nPsalm xxxii. 4 was thus rendered by Kitty: \"Ma-maasture is like t' doong\r\ni' summer.\" He was an old man and quite bald, and used to sit in his\r\ndesk with a blue-spotted pocket-handkerchief spread over his head,\r\noccasionally drawing down a corner of it for use, and then pulling it\r\nstraight again. If the squire happened to come late to church--a thing\r\nwhich did not often happen--the curate would pause in his reading and\r\napologise: \"Good morning, Mr. ----. I am sorry, sir, that I began the\r\nservice. I thought you were not coming this morning.\" One sentence of\r\nthe sermon preached on the death of King William IV long remained in the\r\nmemory of some of his young hearers: \"Behold the King in all his pomp\r\nand glory, soodenly toombled from his high elevation, and mingled wi'\r\nthe doost!\"\r\n\r\nIn 1845 a new church was built on the old site, a new curate came, Kitty\r\nHill died, and was succeeded in his office by his widow, who did all\r\nthat she could do of the clerk's work, and showed remarkable taste in\r\ndecorating the church at Christmas. No clerk was needed for the\r\nresponses, as the congregation joined heartily in the service, and there\r\nwas a much better attendance than there is now. She died in the\r\nearly fifties.\r\n\r\nAmongst other varied readings of the Psalms that of an old parish clerk\r\nat Hartlepool may be given. He had been a sailor, and used to render\r\nPsalm civ. 26 as \"There go the ships, and there is that lieutenant whom\r\nThou hast made to take his pastime therein.\"\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Gatty, in his record of _A Life at One Living_, mentions\r\nthat at Ecclesfield, as in many other places, the office of parish clerk\r\nwas hereditary. The last holder of the office, who used to sit in his\r\ndesk clad in a black bombazine gown, was a publican by trade, a decent,\r\nhonest man, who during the fifty-one years he was clerk was only twice\r\nabsent from service. He died in 1868, and the offices of clerk and\r\nsexton were then united and held by one person.\r\n\r\nThe register books of Weybridge, Surrey, were kept for a great part of\r\nthe eighteenth century by the parish clerks, the son succeeding his\r\nfather in office for three or four generations.\r\n\r\nNow probably the clerks are no more clerks but vergers; and as a\r\nYorkshireman remarked, \"_Verging_ is a very honourable profession.\"\r\n\r\nThe portrait of John Gray, sometime clerk in Eton College Chapel, taken\r\nin his gown as he stood in his desk, has been engraved, and is well\r\nknown to old Etonians.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFew people possess the gift of humour in the same degree as the late\r\nBishop Walsham How, and his stories of the race of parish clerks and\r\nvergers must not be omitted, and are here published by permission of his\r\nson, Mr. F.D. How, editor of _Lighter Moments_.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a deacon, and naturally shy, I was visiting my aunts at\r\nWorkington, where my grandfather had been rector, and was asked to\r\npreach on Sunday evening in St. John's, a wretched modern church--a\r\nplain oblong with galleries, and a pulpit like a very tall wineglass,\r\nwith a very narrow little straight staircase leading up to it, in the\r\nmiddle of the east part of the church. When the hymn before the sermon\r\nwas given out I went as usual to the vestry to put on the black gown.\r\nNot knowing that the clergyman generally stayed there till the end of\r\nthe hymn, I emerged as soon as I had vested myself and walked to the\r\npulpit and ascended the stairs. When nearly at the summit, to my horror\r\nI discovered a very fat beadle in the pulpit lighting the candles. We\r\ncould not possibly pass on the stairs, and the eyes of the whole\r\ncongregation were upon me. It would be ignominious to retreat. So after\r\na few minutes' reflection I saw my way out of the difficulty, which I\r\novercame by a very simple mechanical contrivance. I entered the pulpit,\r\nwhich exactly fitted the beadle and myself, and then face to face we\r\nexecuted a rotary movement to the extent of a semicircle, when the\r\nbeadle finding himself next the door of the pulpit was enabled to\r\ndescend, and I remained master of the situation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Uffington, near Shrewsbury, during the incumbency of the Rev. J.\r\nHopkins, the choir and organist, having been dissatisfied with some\r\narrangement, determined not to take part in the service. So when the\r\nclerk, according to the usual custom of those days, gave out the hymn,\r\nthere was a dead silence. This lasted a little while, and then the\r\nclerk, unable to bear it, rose up and appealed to the congregation,\r\nsaying most imploringly, \"Them as _can_ sing _do_ ye sing: it's misery\r\nto be a this'n\" (Shropshire for \"in this way\").\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Wolstanton, in the Potteries, there was a somewhat fussy verger\r\ncalled Oakes. On one occasion, just at the time of the year when it was\r\ndoubtful whether lights would be wanted or no, and when they had not yet\r\nbeen lighted for evening service, a stranger, who was a very smart young\r\nclergyman, was reading the lessons and had some difficulty in seeing. He\r\nhad on a pair of delicate lavender kid gloves. The verger, perceiving\r\nhis difficulty, went to the vestry, got two candles, lighted them, and\r\nwalked to the lectern, before which he stood solemnly holding the\r\ncandles (without candlesticks) in his hands. This was sufficiently\r\ntrying to the congregation, but suddenly some one rattled the latch of\r\nthe west door, when Oakes, feeling that it was absolutely necessary to\r\ngo and see what was the matter, thrust the two candles into the poor\r\nyoung clergyman's delicately gloved hands, and left him!\r\n\r\nAt the church of Stratfieldsaye, where the Duke of Wellington was a\r\nregular attendant, a stranger was preaching, and the verger when he\r\nended came up the stairs, opened the pulpit door a little way, slammed\r\nit to, and then opened it wide for the preacher to go out. He asked in\r\nthe vestry why he had shut the door again while opening it, and the\r\nverger said, \"We always do that, sir, to wake the duke.\"\r\n\r\nA former young curate of Stoke being very anxious to do things\r\nrubrically, insisted on the ring being put on the \"fourth finger\" at a\r\nwedding he took. The woman resisted and said, \"I would sooner die than\r\nbe married on my little finger.\" The curate said, \"But the rubric says\r\nso,\" whereupon the _deus ex machinâ_ appeared in the shape of the parish\r\nclerk, who stepped forward and said, \"In these cases, sir, the thoomb\r\ncounts as a digit.\"\r\n\r\nA gentleman going to see a ritualistic church in London was walking\r\ninto the chancel when an official stepped forward and said, \"You mustn't\r\ngo in there.\" \"Why not?\" said the gentleman. \"I'm put here to stop you,\"\r\nsaid the man. \"Oh! I see,\" said the gentleman; \"you're what they call\r\nthe _rude_ screen, aren't you?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA clergyman in the diocese of Wakefield told me that when first he came\r\nto the parish he found things in a very neglected state, and among other\r\nchanges he introduced an early celebration of the Holy Communion. An old\r\nclerk collected the offertory, and when he brought it up to the\r\nclergyman he said, \"There's eight on 'em, but two 'asn't paid.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA verger was showing a lady over a church when she asked him if the\r\nvicar was a married man. \"No, ma'am,\" he answered, \"he's a chalybeate.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA verger showing a large church to a stranger, pointed out another man\r\nand said, \"That is the other verger.\" The gentleman said, \"I did not\r\nknow there were two of you,\" and the verger replied, \"Oh, yes, sir, he\r\nwerges up one side of the church and I werges up the other.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn my first visit to Almondbury to preach, the verger came to me in the\r\nvestry and said, \"A've put a platform in t' pulpit for ye; you'll excuse\r\nme, but a little man looks as if he was in a toob.\" (N.B. To prevent\r\nundue inferences I am five feet nine inches in height.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the speakers at the meeting of the Catholic Truth Society at\r\nBristol (Sept., 1895) told a story of a pious Catholic visiting\r\nWestminster Abbey, and kneeling in a quiet corner for private devotion,\r\nwhen he was summoned in stentorian tones to come and view the royal\r\ntombs and chapels. \"But I have seen them,\" said the stranger, \"and I\r\nonly wish to say my prayers.\" \"Prayers is over,\" said the verger.\r\n\"Still, I suppose,\" said the stranger, \"there can be no objection to my\r\nsaying my prayers quietly here?\" \"No objection, sir!\" said the irate\r\nverger. \"Why, it would be an insult to the Dean and Chapter.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Rev. M.E. Jenkins writes his remembrances of several old clerks.\r\n\r\nThere was dear old Robert Livesay, of Blackburn parish church, whom\r\nevery one knew, his large rubicund face beaming with good nature and\r\nhumour--a very kindly old soul. In 1870 I was appointed to an old-world\r\nDale's parish, which had one of the real old Yorkshire clerks, Frank\r\nHutchinson. He was lame and blind in one eye, and well do I recall his\r\nsonorous and tremulous response, his love for the Psalms (Tate and\r\nBrady's); he \"reckoned nought o' _Hymns Ancient and Modern_.\" I used\r\ngenerally to find him with a long pipe in the vestry on my return from\r\nafternoon service. He was a great authority on the ancient history of\r\nthe parish, and was formerly schoolmaster. He had brought up most\r\nrespectably a large family of sons and daughters on the smallest means,\r\nmany of whom still survive. I had a great respect for the old man, and\r\nso he had for me. He was very great at leading that peculiarly\r\ndirge-like wail at the huge Yorkshire funerals. I never could quite make\r\nout any words, but as a singularly effective and musical cadence in a\r\nminor key, it was no doubt a survival, as I once heard Canon Atkinson\r\nsay, the famous vicar of Danby, my immediate neighbour on the moors. At\r\nlast I attended Frank Hutchinson daily in his prolonged decay, and\r\nreceived his solemn blessing and commendation on my work; and he\r\nreceived at my hand a few hours before his death his last communion,\r\nsurrounded by all his children and grandchildren, in his small bedroom,\r\nby the light of a single candle. I can still see his thin face uplifted.\r\nIt is thirty-five years ago, and I can still hear the striking of his\r\nlucifer match in the midst of the afternoon service, and see him holding\r\nup close to his own eye the candle and the book, and can hear his\r\ntremulous \"Amen,\" quite independent of the choral one sung by a small\r\nchoir in the chancel. He was great in epitaphs. A favourite one, which\r\nhe would recite _ore rotunda_, was:\r\n\r\n     \"Let this record, what few vain marbles can,\r\n     Here lies an honest man.\"\r\n\r\nAnother, which, by the way, is in Egton churchyard, ran as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Life is but a winter's day;\r\n     Some breakfast and away,\r\n     Others to dinner stop and are full fed,\r\n     The oldest man but sups and goes to bed.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a genuine old Dalesman of a type passed away. His spirits really\r\nnever survived the abolition of the stringed instruments in the western\r\ngallery with its galaxy of village musicians. \"I hugged bass fiddle for\r\nmany a year,\" he once told me. Peace be to his memory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCanon Atkinson tells of his good and harmless but \"feckless\" parish\r\nclerk and schoolmaster at Danby, whom, when about to take a funeral, he\r\ndiscovered sitting in the sunny embrasure of the west window, with his\r\nhat on, of course, and comfortably smoking his pipe. The clerk was a\r\nbrother of the old vicar of Danby, and they seem to have been a curious\r\nand irreverent pair. The historian of Danby, in his _Forty Years in a\r\nMoorland Parish_, fully describes his first visit to the clerk's school,\r\nand the strange custom of weird singing at funerals to which Mr.\r\nJenkins alludes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother north-country clerk-schoolmaster was obliged to relinquish his\r\nscholastic duties and make way for a certified teacher. One day he heard\r\nthe new master tell his pupils: \"'A' is an indefinite article. 'A' is\r\none, and can only be applied to one thing. You cannot say a cats or a\r\ndogs; but only a cat, a dog.\" The clerk at once reported the matter to\r\nhis rector. \"Here's a pretty fellow you've got to keep school! He says\r\nthat you can only apply the article 'a' to nouns of the singular number;\r\nand here have I been singing 'A--men' all my life, and your reverence\r\nhas never once corrected me.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCommunicated by Mrs. Williamson, Lydgate Vicarage:\r\n\r\nThe old parish clerk of Radcliffe was secretary of the races committee,\r\nand would hurry out of church to attend these meetings. Mr. Foxley, the\r\nrector, was told of this weakness of his clerk, so one Wednesday\r\nevening, when the rector knew there was a meeting, he got into the\r\npulpit (a three-decker was then in the church), and began his sermon.\r\nHalf an hour went by, then the clerk began to be restless. Another\r\nhalf-hour passed; the clerk looked up from his seat under the pulpit,\r\nbut still the rector went on preaching. It was too late then for the\r\nrace-course meeting. So when the sermon was at length finished, the\r\nclerk got up and gave out \"the 'undred and nineteenth Psalm from yend\r\nto yend. He's preached all day, and we'll sing all neet\" (night).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Westhoughton Church, Lancashire, there was a clerk of the old school,\r\none Platt, who just before the sermon would stretch his long arm and\r\noffer his snuff-box to his old friend Betty, and to other cronies who\r\nhappened to be in his immediate neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe clerk at Stratfieldsaye, who was a character, once astonished a\r\nstrange clergyman who was taking the duty. The choir sat in the gallery,\r\nand the numbers were few on that Sunday. \"Mon I 'elp them chaps? they be\r\nterrible few,\" said the clerk. The clergyman quite agreed that he should\r\nrender them his valuable assistance, and sit in the gallery. Presently a\r\nman came in late, and was kneeling down to say his private prayer, when\r\nthe clergyman was horrified to see the clerk deliberately rise in the\r\ngallery and throw a book at the man's head. When remonstrated with after\r\nservice the clerk replied carelessly, \"Oh, it were only my way o'\r\ntelling him to sing up, as we were terrible short this marning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nCURIOUS STORIES\r\n\r\nThe old clerk of Clapham, Bedford, Mr. Thomas Maddams, always used to\r\nread his own version of Psalm xxxix. 12: \"Like as it were a moth\r\nfretting in a garment.\" Apparently his idea was of a moth annoyed at\r\nbeing in a garment from which it could not escape.\r\n\r\nA parish clerk (who prided himself upon being well read) occupied his\r\nseat below the old \"three-decker\" pulpit, and whenever a quotation or an\r\nextract from the classics was introduced into the sermon he, in an\r\nundertone, muttered its source, much to the annoyance of the preacher\r\nand amusement of the congregation. Despite all protests in private, the\r\nthing continued, until one day, the vicar's patience being exhausted, he\r\nleant over the pulpit side and immediately exclaimed, \"Drat you; shut\r\nup!\" Immediately, in the clerk's usual sententious tone, came the reply,\r\n\"His own.\" (William Haggard, _Liverpool Daily Post_.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nN.B. I have heard this story before, and in a different key:\r\n\r\nThe preacher was a young, bumptious fellow, fond of quoting the\r\nclassics, etc. One day a learned classic scholar attended his service,\r\nand was heard to say, after each quotation, \"That's Horace,\" \"That's\r\nPlato,\" and such-like, until the preacher was at his \"wits' ends\" how\r\nto quiet the man. At last, leaning over the pulpit, he looked the man in\r\nthe face, and is reported to have said, \"Who the devil are you?\" \"That's\r\nhis own!\" was the prompt response.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn one of the village churches near Honiton, in 1864, the usual duet\r\nbetween the parson and clerk had been the custom, when the vicar\r\nappealed to the congregation to take their part. In a little while they\r\ntook courage, and did so. This annoyed the clerk, and he could not make\r\nthe responses, and made so many mistakes that the vicar drew his\r\nattention to the matter. He replied, with much irritation, \"How can _I_\r\ndo the service with a lot of men and women a-buzzing and a-fizzing\r\nabout me?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar story is told of another church:\r\n\r\nAn old gentleman, now in his eightieth year, remembers attending Romford\r\nChurch when a youth, and says that at that time (1840) the parish clerk\r\nwas a person who greatly magnified his office. On one occasion he\r\nchecked the young man for audibly responding, on the ground that he, the\r\nclerk, was the person to respond audibly, and that other people were to\r\nrespond inaudibly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCommunicated by Miss Emily J. Heaton, of Sitting-bourne:\r\n\r\nMy father lived and worked as the clergyman of a parish until he was\r\neighty-nine years of age. He remembered a clerk in a Yorkshire parish in\r\nthe time of one of the Georges. The clergyman said the versicle, \"O\r\nLord, save the King,\" and the clerk made no reply. The prayer was\r\nrepeated, but still no answer. He then touched the clerk, who sat in\r\nthe desk below, and who replied:\r\n\r\n\"A we'ant! He won't tak tax off 'bacca!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCommunicated by Mr. Frederick Sherlock:\r\n\r\nI remember as a lad attending a church which owned a magnificent\r\nspecimen of the parish clerk. He used to wear a dress-coat, and it was\r\nhis practice to follow the clergy from the vestry, and while the vicar\r\nand curate were saying their private prayers in the reading-desk in\r\nwhich they both sat together, the venerable clerk with measured tread\r\npassed down the centre of the church affably smiling and bowing right\r\nand left to such of the parishioners as were in his favour. In due\r\ncourse he arrived in the singers' gallery, where he had the place of\r\nhonour under the organ: the good old man was leading soloist, which we\r\nwell knew when Jackson's _Te Deum_ was sung on the greater festivals,\r\nfor there was always a solemn pause before the venerable worthy quavered\r\nforth his solo.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a pew-rented church, and once a quarter strangers were startled,\r\nwhen the vicar from his place in the reading-desk had announced the\r\nvarious engagements of the week, to hear the clerk's majestic voice from\r\nhis place in the gallery add, \"And _I_ beg to announce\" (with a marked\r\nemphasis on the _I_) \"that the churchwardens will attend in the vestry\r\non Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday next, at eight o'clock, for the\r\npurpose of receiving pew rents and letting seats for the\r\nensuing quarter.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs touching parish clerks, it is of interest to recall that William\r\nMaybrick was clerk of St. Peter's, Liverpool, from 1813-48. He had two\r\nsons, William, who became clerk, and Michael, who was organist at St.\r\nPeter's for many years. William Maybrick, junior, had also two sons,\r\nJames, whose name was so much before the public owing to the\r\ncircumstances surrounding his death, and Michael, better known as\r\n\"Stephen Adams,\" the famous composer and singer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following is a curious letter from a parish clerk to his vicar after\r\ngiving notice to quit the latter's service. He was clerk of the parish\r\nof Maldon, Essex.\r\n\r\nDEAR AND REV. SIR,\r\n\r\nI avail myself of the opportunity of troubling your honour with these\r\nlines, which I hope you will excuse, which is the very sentiments of\r\nyour humble servant's heart. Ignorantly, rashly, but reluctantly, I gave\r\nyou warning to leave your highly respected office and most amiable duty,\r\nas being your servant, and clerk of this your most well wished parish,\r\nand place of my succour and support.\r\n\r\nBut, dear Sir, I well know it was no fault of yours nor from any of my\r\nmost worthy parishioners. It were because I thought I were not\r\nsufficiently paid for the interments of the silent dead. But will I be a\r\nJudas and leave the house of my God, the place where His Honour dwelleth\r\nfor a few pieces of money? No. Will I be a Peter and deny myself of an\r\noffice in His Sanctuary and cause me to weep bitterly? No. Can I be so\r\nunreasonable as to deny, if I like and am well, to ring that solemn bell\r\nthat speaks the departure of a soul? No. Can I leave digging the tombs\r\nof my neighbours and acquaintances which have many a time made me\r\nshudder and think of my mortality, when I have dug up the mortal remains\r\nof some perhaps as I well knew? No. And can I so abruptly forsake the\r\nservice of my beloved Church of which I have not failed to attend every\r\nSunday for these seven and a half years? No. Can I leave waiting upon\r\nyou a minister of that Being that sitteth between the Cherubim and\r\nflieth upon the wings of the wind? No. Can I leave the place where our\r\nmost holy services nobly calls forth and says, \"Those whom God have\r\njoined together\" (and being as I am a married man) \"let no man put\r\nasunder\"? No. And can I leave that ordinance where you say then and\r\nthere \"I baptize thee in the name of the Father and of the Son and of\r\nthe Holy Ghost,\" and he becomes regenerate and is grafted into the body\r\nof Christ's Church? No. And can I think of leaving off cleaning at\r\nEaster the House of God in which I take such delight, in looking down\r\nher aisles and beholding her sanctuaries and the table of the Lord? No.\r\nAnd can I forsake taking part in the service of Thanksgiving of women\r\nafter childbirth when mine own wife has been delivered ten times? No.\r\nAnd can I leave off waiting on the congregation of the Lord which you\r\nwell know, Sir, is my delight? No. And can I forsake the Table of the\r\nLord at which I have feasted I suppose some thirty times? No. And, dear\r\nSir, can I ever forsake you who have been so kind to me? No. And I well\r\nknow you will not entreat me to leave, neither to return from following\r\nafter you, for where you pray there will I pray, where you worship there\r\nwill I worship. Your Church shall be my Church, your people shall be my\r\npeople and your God my God. By the waters of Babylon am I to sit down\r\nand weep and leave thee, O my Church! and hang my harp upon the trees\r\nthat grow therein? No. One thing have I desired of the Lord that I will\r\nrequire even that I may dwell in the House of the Lord and to visit His\r\ntemple. More to be desired of me, O my Church, than gold, yea than fine\r\ngold, sweeter to me than honey and the honeycomb.\r\n\r\nNow, kind Sir, the very desire of my heart is still to wait upon you.\r\nPlease tell the Churchwardens all is reconciled, and if not, I will get\r\nme away into the wilderness, and hide me in the desert, in the cleft of\r\nthe rock. But I hope still to be your Gehazi and when I meet my\r\nShunamite to say \"All, all is well.\" And I will conclude my blunders\r\nwith my oft-repeated prayer, \"Glory be to the Father and to the Son and\r\nto the Holy Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall\r\nbe, world without end. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nP.S. Now, Sir, I shall go on with my fees the same as I found them, and\r\nwill make no more trouble about them, but I will not, I cannot leave\r\nyou, nor your delightful duties.\r\n\r\nYour most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nGEORGE G---- G.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Rev. E. G----, Vicar of Maldon._\r\n\r\nCommunicated by the Rev. D. C. Moore:\r\n\r\nIn the parish of Belton, Suffolk, there died in 1837 a man named Noah\r\nPole. He had been clerk for sixty years. He wore a smock-frock; gave out\r\nall notices--strayed horse, a found sheep, etc. He was known by the\r\nnickname of \"_Never, never_ shall be,\" for in this way he had for sixty\r\nyears perverted the last part of the \"Gloria,\" \"now and ever shall be.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the parish of Lowestoft, Suffolk, in the forties the parish clerk's\r\nname was Newson (would-be wits called him \"Nuisance\"). He was arrayed in\r\na velvet-trimmed robe and bore himself bravely. The way in which he\r\nmouthed \"Let us sing to the glory of God\" was wonderful. But the chief\r\namusement he afforded was the habit of hiding his face in his hands\r\nduring each prayer, then towards the ending his head would rise till it\r\nrested on his thumbs, and then came out sonorously, \"Awl-men.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt St. Mary's, Southtown (near Great Yarmouth), in the late thirties,\r\netc., a man named Nolloth was clerk. He was celebrated for the\r\nuncertainty of his \"H's.\" For example: \"Let us sing to the praise and\r\nglory of God the Heighty-heighth ymn.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Gorleston (the mother church of St. Mary's, named above) a tailor\r\nnamed Bristow was clerk. He was a very small man, and he had a son he\r\nwished to succeed him. The clerk's desk was pretty wide and they sat\r\ntogether. I can see them (sixty years after), one leaning on his right\r\narm, the other on his left; and when the time came, the duet was\r\n_Ah_-men from the elder and A-men from the younger, one in \"tenor\" the\r\nother \"treble.\" We schoolboys used to say \"Big pig, little pig.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNicholson, the clerk of St. Bees, if any student was called away in\r\nterm, invariably gave out Psalm cvii., fourth part, \"They that in ships\r\nwith courage bold.\" In those days there were no trains and no hymns.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Barkham there is an old clerk who succeeded his father half a century\r\nago.\r\n\r\nDuring the rebuilding of the church his sire, whose name was Elijah,\r\nonce visited a neighbouring parish church, and arrived rather late, just\r\nwhen the rector was giving out the text: \"What doest thou here,\r\nElijah?\" Elijah gave a respectful salute, and replied: \"Please, sur,\r\nBarkham Church is undergoing repair, so I be cumed 'ere!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCanon Rawnsley tells a pathetic little story of an old clerk who begged\r\nhim not to read the service so fast: \"For you moòst gie me toime, Mr.\r\nRawnsley, you moòst i'deed. You moòst gie me toime, for I've a\r\ngraaceless wife an' two godless soons to praày for.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHawker tells a story of the parish clerk at Morwenstow whose wife used\r\nto wash the parson's surplices. He came home one night from a prolonged\r\nvisit at the village inn, the \"Bush,\" and finding his wife's scolding\r\nnot to his mind and depressing, he said, \"Look yere, my dear, if you\r\ndoan't stop, I'll go straight back again.\" She did not stop, so he left\r\nthe house; but the wife donned one of the surplices and, making a short\r\ncut, stood in front of her approaching husband. He was terrified; but at\r\nlast he remembered his official position, and the thought gave\r\nhim courage.\r\n\r\n\"Avide, Satan!\" he said in a thick, slow voice.\r\n\r\nThe figure made no answer.\r\n\r\n\"Avide, Satan!\" he shouted again. \"Doan't 'e knaw I be clerk of the\r\nparish, bass-viol player, and taicher of the singers?\"\r\n\r\nWhen the apparition failed to be impressed the clerk turned tail and\r\nfled. The ghost returned by a short cut, and the clerk found his wife\r\ncalmly ironing the parson's surplice. He did not return to the \"Bush\"\r\nthat night.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe old parish clerk of Dagenham had a habit when stating the names to\r\nbe entered into the register of saying, _Plain_ Robert or John, etc.,\r\nmeaning that Robert, etc., was the only Christian name. On one occasion\r\na strange clergyman baptized a child there, and being unable to hear the\r\nname as given by the parents, looked inquiringly at the clerk. \"Plain\r\nJane, sir,\" he called out in a stentorian voice. \"What a pity to label\r\nthe child thus,\" the clergyman rejoined; \"she might grow up to be a\r\nbeautiful girl.\" \"Jane _only_, I mean,\" explained the clerk.\r\n\r\nAll clergymen know the difficulty of changing the names of the sovereign\r\nand the Royal Family at the commencement of the reign of a new monarch.\r\n\r\nIn a certain parish in the south of England (the name of which I do not\r\nknow, or have forgotten), at the time of the accession of Her late\r\nMajesty Queen Victoria, the rector charged his clerk to make the\r\nnecessary alterations in the Book of Common Prayer required by the sex\r\nof the new sovereign. The clerk made all the needed alterations with the\r\ngreatest care as regards both titles and pronouns; but not only this, he\r\ncarried on the changes throughout the Psalter. Consequently, on the\r\nmorning of the fourth day of the month, for instance, the rector found\r\nPsalm xxi. rendered thus: \"The Queen shall rejoice in Thy strength, O\r\nLord: exceeding glad shall She be of Thy salvation,\" and so on\r\nthroughout the course of the Psalms and the whole of the Psalter. Also\r\nin the prayer for the Church Militant, when prayer is made for all\r\nChristian kings, princes, etc., the distracted vicar found the words\r\nchanged into \"Queen, Princesses, etc.\" After all, the clerk showed his\r\nthoroughness, but nothing short of a new Prayer Book could satisfy the\r\nneeds of the vicar[94].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: From the information of Miss Marion Stirling, who heard\r\nthe story from Prebendary Thornton.]\r\n\r\nCanon Gregory Smith tells the following story of a clerk in\r\nHerefordshire, who flourished half a century ago:\r\n\r\nIn the west-end gallery of the old-fashioned little church were\r\nmusicians with fifes, etc. etc. Sometimes, if they started badly in a\r\nhymn, the clerk would say to the congregation, \"Beg pardon, gents; we'll\r\ntry again.\"\r\n\r\nAs I left home one day, the clerk ran after me. \"But, sir, who'll take\r\nthe duty on St. Swithin's Day?\"\r\n\r\nOnce or twice, being somnolent, on a hot afternoon he woke up suddenly\r\nwith a loud \"Amen\" in the middle of the sermon.\r\n\r\nWhen I said good-bye to him, having resigned the benefice, he said, very\r\ngravely, \"God will give us another comforter.\"\r\n\r\nAn old country clerk in showing visitors round the churchyard used to\r\nstop at a certain tombstone and say:\r\n\r\n\"This 'ere is the tomb of Thomas 'Ooper and 'is eleven wives.\"\r\n\r\nOne day a lady remarked: \"Eleven? Dear me, that's rather a lot, isn't\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man looked at her gravely and replied: \"Well, mum, yer see it\r\nwus an' 'obby of 'is'n.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. W.D. Parish, in his _Dictionary of the Sussex Dialect_, tells\r\nof a friend of his who had been remonstrating with one of his\r\nparishioners for abusing the parish clerk beyond the bounds of\r\nneighbourly expression, and who received the following answer: \"You be\r\nquite right, sir; you be quite right. I'd no ought to have said what I\r\ndid; but I döant mind telling you to your head what I've said so many\r\ntimes behind your back. We've got a good shepherd, I says, an excellent\r\nshepherd, but he's got an unaccountable bad dog.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome seventy or eighty years ago at Thame Church, Buckinghamshire, the\r\nold-fashioned clerk had a much-worn Prayer Book, and the parson and he\r\nmade a duet of the responses, the congregation not considering it\r\nnecessary or even proper to interfere. When the clerk happened to come\r\nto a verse of the Psalms with words missing he said \"riven out\"\r\n(pronounced oot), and the parson finished the verse; this was taken\r\nquite as a matter of course by the congregation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a Lancashire church, when the rector was about to publish the banns\r\nof marriage, the book was not in its usual place. However, he began: \"I\r\npublish the banns of marriage ... I publish ... the banns\"--when the\r\nclerk looked up from the lowest box of the \"three-decker,\" and said in a\r\ntone not _sotto voce_, \"'Twixt th' cushion and th' desk, sur.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPrayer Book words are sometimes a puzzle to illiterate clerks. At the\r\npresent time in a Berkshire church the clerk always speaks of\r\n\"Athanasian's Creed,\" and of \"the Anthony-Communion hymn.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis views of art are occasionally curious. An odd specimen of his race\r\nwas showing to some strangers a stained-glass window recently erected in\r\nmemory of a gentleman and lady who had just died. It was a two-light\r\nwindow with figures of Moses and Aaron. \"There they be, sir, but they\r\ndon't much feature the old couple,\" said the clerk, who regarded them as\r\nlikenesses of the deceased.\r\n\r\nA clergyman on one occasion had some trouble with his dog. This dog\r\nemulated the achievements of Newton's \"Fido,\" and tore and devoured some\r\nleaves of the parson's sermon. The parson was taking the duty of a\r\nneighbour, and feared lest his mutilated discourse would be too short\r\nfor the edification of the congregation. So after the service he\r\nconsulted the clerk. \"Was my sermon too long to-day?\" \"No,\" replied the\r\nclerk. \"Then was it too short?\" \"Nay, you was jist about right.\" Much\r\nrelieved, the parson then told the clerk the story of the dog's\r\nmisdemeanours, and of his fear lest the sermon should prove too short.\r\nThe old clerk scratched his head and then exclaimed, with a very solemn\r\nface, \"Ah! maister ----, our parson be a grade sight too long to plaise\r\nus. Would you just give him a pup?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA writer in _Notes and Queries_ tells a story of an old-fashioned\r\nservice, and with this we will conclude our collection of curious tales.\r\n\r\nA lady friend of the writer still living, and the daughter of a\r\nclergyman, assured him that in a country parish, where the church\r\nservice was conducted in a very free-and-easy, go-as-you-please sort of\r\nway, the clerk, looking up at the parson, asked, \"What shall we do\r\nnext, zurr?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nLONGEVITY AND HEREDITY--THE DEACON-CLERKS OF BARNSTAPLE\r\n\r\nThere are numerous instances of the hereditary nature of the clerk's\r\noffice, which has frequently been passed on from father to son through\r\nseveral generations. I have already mentioned the Osbornes of\r\nBelbroughton, Worcestershire, who were parish clerks and tailors in the\r\nvillage from the time of Henry VIII, and the Worralls of Wolverley in\r\nthe same county, whose reign extended over a century.\r\n\r\nDavid Clarkson, the parish clerk of Feckenham, died in 1854, and his\r\nancestors occupied the same office for two centuries. King's Norton had\r\na famous race of clerks, of the name of Ford, who also served for the\r\nsame period. The Fords were a long-lived family, as two of them held the\r\noffice for 102 years. Cuthbert Bede mentions also the following\r\nremarkable instances of heredity:\r\n\r\nThe Roses were parish clerks at Bromsgrove from \"time out of mind.\" The\r\nBonds were parish clerks at St. Michael's, Worcester, for a century.\r\nJohn Tustin had in 1856 been clerk of Broadway for fifty-two years, his\r\nfather and grandfather having previously held the office. Charles Orford\r\ndied at Oldswinford December 28th, 1855, aged seventy-three years,\r\nhaving been parish clerk from his youth, and having succeeded his\r\nfather in that capacity: he was succeeded by his son Thomas Orford, who\r\nwas again succeeded by his own son William, one of the present vergers\r\nin this church, aged seventy years. All these examples are taken from\r\nparishes in Worcestershire. An extraordinary instance of longevity and\r\nheredity occurs in the annals of the parish of Chapel-en-le-Frith,\r\nDerbyshire. Peter Bramwell, clerk of the parish, died in 1854, after\r\nhaving held the office for forty-three years. His father Peter Bramwell\r\nwas clerk for fifty years, his grandfather George Bramwell for\r\nthirty-eight years, his great-great-grandfather George Bramwell for\r\nforty years, and his great-great-great-grandfather Peter Bramwell for\r\nfifty-two years. The total number of years during which the parish was\r\nserved by this family of clerks was 223, and by only five members of it,\r\ngiving an average of forty-four years and nine months for each--a\r\nwonderful record truly!\r\n\r\nNor are these instances of the hereditary nature of the office, and of\r\nthe fact that the duties of the position seem to contribute to the\r\nlengthened days of the holders of it, entirely passed away. The\r\nriverside town of Marlow, Buckinghamshire, furnishes an example of this.\r\nMr. H.W. Badger has occupied the position of parish clerk for half a\r\ncentury, and a few months ago was presented by the townspeople with an\r\nilluminated address, together with a purse of fifty-five sovereigns, in\r\nrecognition of his long term of service and of the esteem in which he is\r\nheld. He was appointed in 1855 in succession to his father, Henry\r\nBadger, appointed in 1832, who succeeded his grandfather, Wildsmith\r\nBadger, who became parish clerk in 1789.\r\n\r\nThe oldest parish clerk living is James Carne, who serves in the parish\r\nof St. Columb Minor, Cornwall, and has held the office for fifty-eight\r\nyears. He is now in his hundred and first year, and still is unremitting\r\nin attention to duty, and regularly attends church. He followed in the\r\nwake of his father and grandfather, who filled the same position for\r\nfifty-four years and fifty years respectively.\r\n\r\nMr. Edward J. Lupson is the much-respected parish clerk of Great\r\nYarmouth, who is a great authority on the history of the important\r\nchurch in which he officiates, and is the author of several books. He\r\nhas written an excellent guide to the church of St. Nicholas, and a\r\nvolume entitled _Cupid's Pupils_, compiled from the personal\r\n\"recollections of a parish clerk who assisted at ten thousand four\r\nhundred marriages and gave away eleven hundred and thirty brides\"--a\r\nwonderful record, which, as the book was published seven years ago, has\r\nnow been largely exceeded. The book is brightly written, and abounds in\r\nthe records of amusing instances of nervous and forgetful brides and\r\nbride-grooms, of extraordinary blunders, of the failings of\r\ninexperienced clergy, and is a full and complete guide to those who\r\ncontemplate matrimony. His guide to the church he loves so well is\r\nadmirable. It appears there is a clerks' book at Great Yarmouth, which\r\ncontains a number of interesting notes and memoranda. The clerks of this\r\nchurch were men of importance and position in the town. In 1760 John\r\nMarsh, who succeeded Sampson Winn, was a town councillor. He was\r\nsucceeded in 1785 by Mr. Richard Pitt, the son of a former mayor, and he\r\nand his wife and sixteen children were interred in the north chancel\r\naisle, where a mural monument records their memories. The clerks at this\r\nperiod, until 1831, were appointed by the corporation and paid by the\r\nborough. In 1800 Mr. Richard Miller resigned his aldermanic gown to\r\naccept the office. Mr. David Absolon (1811-31) was a member of the\r\ncorporation before receiving the appointment. Mr. John Seaman reigned\r\nfrom 1831 to 1841, and was followed by Mr. James Burman, who was the\r\nlast clerk who took part in that curious duet with the vicar, to which\r\nwe have often referred. He was an accomplished campanologist and\r\ncomposed several peals. In 1863 Mr. Lupson was appointed, who has so\r\nmuch honoured his office and earned the respect of all who know him. The\r\nold fashion of the clerk wearing gown and bands is continued at\r\nGreat Yarmouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES CARNE, PARISH CLERK OF ST. COLUMB-MINOR, CORNWALL.\r\nTHE OLDEST LIVING CLERK.]\r\n\r\nMr. Lupson tells of his strange experiences when conducting visitors\r\nround the church, and explaining to them the varied objects of interest.\r\nWhat our clerks have to put up with may be news to many. I will give it\r\nin his own words:\r\n\r\nAlthough a congenial and profitable engagement, it was often felt to be\r\nweary work, talking about the same things many times each day week after\r\nweek: and anything but easy to exhibit the freshness and retain the\r\nvivacity that was desirable. Fortunately the monotony of the recital\r\nfound considerable relief from the varied receptions it met with. Among\r\nthe many thousand individuals, of all grades and classes, from the\r\nhighest to the lowest, thus come in contact with, a diversified and wide\r\nrange of characters was inevitable. The vast majority happily consisted\r\nof persons with whom it was pleasant to spend half an hour within the\r\nsacred walls, so gratified were they with what they saw and heard: some\r\nproving so enthusiastic, and showing such absorbing interest, that at\r\nevery convenient halting-place they would take a seat, and comfortably\r\nadjust themselves as if preparing to hear an address from a favourite\r\npreacher. Occasionally, however, we had to endure the presence of\r\npersons who appeared to be suffering from disordered livers, or had\r\nnettles in their boots, so restless and dissatisfied were they. Scarcely\r\nanything pleased them. Undesirable individuals would sometimes be\r\ndiscovered in the midst of otherwise pleasant parties. Of such may be\r\nmentioned those who knew of much finer churches they could really\r\nadmire. Whenever we heard the preface--\"There's one thing strikes me in\r\nthis church\"--we were prepared to hear a depreciatory remark of some\r\nkind. Some would take pleasure in breaking the sequence of the story by\r\nanticipating matters not then reached, and causing divers interruptions.\r\nOthers would annoy by preferring persistent speaking to listening. It\r\nwas trying work going round with, and explaining to, persons from whom\r\nnothing but mono-syllables could be drawn, either through nervousness,\r\nor from realising their exalted status to be miles above the person who\r\nwas supposing himself able to interest them. Anything but desirable\r\npersons were they who, after going round the church, returned with other\r\nfriends, and then posed as men whose knowledge of the building was\r\nequal, if not a shade superior, to that of the guide. Some parties would\r\nwaste the time, and try one's patience by having amongst them laggards,\r\nto whom explanations already given had to be repeated. But we must pass\r\nby others, and proceed. The mind would sometimes find diversion by\r\nobserving the idiosyncrasies, and detecting the pretensions of\r\nindividuals. Gradually gaining acquaintance as we proceeded, we\r\noccasionally discovered some were aping gentility: some assuming\r\npositions that knew them not, and some claiming talents they did not\r\npossess. We will unmask a specimen of the latter class. A man, who was\r\nunaccompanied by friends, wished to see the church he had heard so much\r\nof. He seemed about thirty years of age; was a made-up exquisite,\r\nlooking very imposing, peering as he did through gold-rimmed spectacles.\r\nHis talents were of such an order he could not think of hiding them. He\r\nhad learned Hebrew, not from printed books, as ordinary scholars are\r\nwont to do, but from MSS., and found it so easy a matter, it \"only took\r\ntwo hours,\" and it was simply \"out of curiosity\" that he undertook it.\r\nBefore mentally placing this paragon among the classics, we showed him\r\nour MS. Roll (exquisitely written, as many visitors are aware, in\r\nunpointed Hebrew), and asked him to read a few words. This was indeed\r\npricking the bubble. Tell it not in Gath, but publish we will, the\r\ndiscovery we instantly made. Our Hebrew scholar had forgotten that\r\nHebrew ran from right to left! and worse still, he even shook his\r\nintellectual head, and gravely confessed that he \"wasn't quite sure but\r\nthat the Roll was written in Greek.\"\r\n\r\nOther sources of relief to the mind jaded with constant repetition arose\r\nfrom the peculiar remarks that were made, and the strange questions that\r\nwere often asked.\r\n\r\nThe organ has been a source of wonderment to multitudes who had never\r\nseen or heard of a divided organ. Wonderful stories had reached the ears\r\nof some respecting it.\r\n\r\n\"Is this the organ that was wrecked?\" \"Is this the organ that was dug\r\nout of the sea?\" \"Is this the organ that was taken out of the Spanish\r\ngalleon?\" \"Wasn't this organ smuggled out of some ship?\" \"Didn't it\r\nbelong to Handel?\" \"Wasn't this organ made for St. Peter's at Rome?\"\r\nWith confidence says one, \"This organ really belongs to the continent;\r\nit was confiscated in some war.\" Whilst another as confidently asserts\r\nthat \"it was built in Holland for one of the English cathedrals, and the\r\nvessel that conveyed it was caught in a storm and wrecked upon Yarmouth\r\nbeach; it was then taken possession of by the inhabitants and erected in\r\nthis church.\" Others, wishing to show their intimate knowledge of this\r\ninstrument, have told their friends that the trumpet, which is a solid\r\npiece of wood, held by the angel at the summit of the northern\r\norgan-case, is only blown at the death of a royal person. And a lady,\r\ninstead of informing her friend that it was a _vox humana_ stop, called\r\nit a _vox populi_.\r\n\r\nWe were asked by one, \"Did this organ break the windows? I was told a\r\nfestival service was going on, the organist blew the trumpet stop, and\r\nbroke the windows.\" Another inquiry was, \"Who invented the pedals of\r\nthis organ? We were told that quite a youth believed that pedals would\r\nimprove it. He added them, and to the day of his death, whenever he was\r\nwithin a few miles of Yarmouth, he would come and hear them.\" In our\r\nhearing one man informed another that \"this organ has miles of piping\r\nrunning somewhere about the town underground.\" The queries we have had\r\nto answer have been exceedingly numerous. Looking at the enclosure\r\ncontaining the console of the organ, a visitor wished to know whether\r\nthe organist sat inside there. Another asked whether it was the vestry.\r\nOne who saw great possibilities in such an organ inquired, \"Can he play\r\nthis organ in any other place beside the key-board?\" The pulpit being of\r\nso unique a character has had a full share of attention, and no lack of\r\nadmirers. Gazing at it with eyes filled with wonderment, a woman said to\r\nher daughter, \"Maria, you're not to touch not even the pews.\" Everything\r\nwithin sight of such a structure she held sacred. Astonished at its\r\ninternal capacity, another asked, \"Do all the clergy sit in it?\" Not\r\nrealising its true character and intent, a lady wished to know, \"By whom\r\nwas this monument erected?\" As we had long since ascertained how\r\nimpossible it was to please everybody, we were not surprised to find\r\ndissatisfied critics presenting themselves. One of this class said, \"It\r\nlooks like a tomb, and smells like a coffin.\" Another, with sarcastic\r\nwit, said, \"Moses looks like some churchwarden who would have to be\r\ncareful how he ate his soup.\" We append a few more questions we have had\r\nto answer:\r\n\r\n\"Was this church built by St. Nicholas?\"\r\n\r\n\"Does this church stand in four parishes?\"\r\n\r\n\"How many miles is it round the walls of this church?\"\r\n\r\n\"How many does this hold? We were told it holds 12,000.\"\r\n\r\nA clergyman asked, \"Where are the bells? Are they in the tower?\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't you a Bible 3000 years old?\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't you a Bible that turns over its own leaves?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who had the missing leaves of this (Cranmer's) Bible?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this the Bible that was chained in Brentwood Church?\"\r\n\r\nA lady pointing to the font asked, \"Is that the Communion Table?\"\r\n\r\nAn elderly lady at the brass lectern inquired, \"Is this the clerk's\r\nseat?\"\r\n\r\nA man standing looking over the Communion rails wished to know, \"What\r\npart of the church do you call this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Was one of the giants buried in the churchyard?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is the gravestone where a man, his wife, and twenty-five children\r\nwere buried? I saw it when I was here some years ago, and forget on\r\nwhich side of the church it is.\"\r\n\r\nA young man gazing at the top of the lofty flagstaff just inside the\r\nchurchyard gates, asked, \"Was that erected to the memory of a\r\nshipwrecked crew?\"\r\n\r\nWith such extraordinary exhibitions of blatant ignorance can a worthy\r\nclerk regale himself, but they must be very trying at times.\r\n\r\nMr. Lupson has also written _The Friendly Guide to the Parish Church and\r\nother places of interest in the neighbourhood, The Rows of Great\r\nYarmouth; why so constructed_, and some devotional works.\r\n\r\nHe is also the author of the following additional verse to the National\r\nAnthem, sung on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria:\r\n\r\n     \"Long life our Queen has seen:\r\n     Glorious her reign has been:\r\n       Secure her throne!\r\n     Her subjects' joy and pride,\r\n     God's Word be still her guide:\r\n     Long may she yet abide\r\n       Empress and Queen!\"\r\n\r\nThe sons of parish clerks have sometimes attained to high dignity in the\r\nChurch. The clerk of Totnes, Devonshire, had a son who was born in 1718,\r\nand who became the distinguished author and theologian, Dr. Kennicott.\r\nOn one occasion he went to preach at the church in his native village,\r\nwhere his father was still acting as clerk. The old man insisted upon\r\nperforming his accustomed duties, placing the surplice or black gown on\r\nhis son's shoulders, and sitting below him in the clerk's lowly desk.\r\nThe mother of the scholar was so overcome with joy at hearing him\r\npreach, that she fainted and was carried out of the church insensible.\r\nCuthbert Bede records that he was acquainted with two eminent clergymen\r\nwho were the sons of parish clerks. One of them was a learned professor\r\nof a college and an author of repute, and the other was attended by his\r\nfather in the same manner as Dr. Kennicott was by his.\r\n\r\nSometimes our failures are the stepping-stones to success in life. The\r\ncelebrated Dr. Prideaux, Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford and\r\nBishop of Worcester in 1641, was the son of poor parents at Harford,\r\nnear Totnes. He applied for the post of parish clerk at Ugborough, but\r\nfailed to obtain the appointment. He was much disappointed, and in\r\ndespair wandered to Oxford, where he became a servitor at Exeter\r\nCollege, and ultimately attained to the position of rector or head of\r\nhis college. When he became bishop, he was accustomed to say, \"If I\r\ncould have been clerk of Ugborough, I had never been bishop of\r\nWorcester.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of the clerks of Barnstaple (1500-1900) has been traced by\r\nthe Rev. J.F. Chanter[95], and the record is remarkable as showing their\r\nimportant status, and how some were raised to the diaconate, and in\r\ndifficult times rendered good service to the Church and the incumbents.\r\nThe first clerk of whom any trace can be found was Thomas Hunt\r\n(1540-68). He appears in the register books as _clericus de hoc opido_,\r\nand in the churchwardens' accounts for 1564 there is an entry, \"Item to\r\nHunt the clerke paid for lights 2 s. 8 d.\" He was succeeded by his son,\r\nJohn Hunt (1564-84). Robert Langdon flourished as clerk from 1584 to\r\n1625, when spiritual matters were at a low ebb in the parish. The vicar\r\nwas excommunicated in 1589. His successor quickly resigned, and the next\r\nvicar was soon involved in feuds with some of his puritanically inclined\r\nparishioners. The quarrel was increased by the unworthy conduct of\r\nRobert Smyth, a preacher and lecturer who was appointed and paid by the\r\ncorporation, and cared little for vicar or bishop. He was an extreme\r\nPuritan, and had a considerable following in the parish. His refusal to\r\nwear a surplice, though ordered to do so by the bishop, brought the\r\ndispute to a head. He was inhibited, but his followers retorted by\r\naccusing the vicar of being a companion of tipplers and fooling away his\r\ntime with pipe and tabor, and finally bringing an accusation against\r\nhim, on account of which the poor man was cited before the High\r\nCommission Court. The charge came to nothing, and Smyth for a time\r\nconformed and wore his surplice. Then some of the Puritan faction\r\nrefused to accept the vicar's ministrations, and two of them were tried\r\nat the assizes and sent to gaol. \"If they would rather go to gaol than\r\nchurch,\" said the town clerk, \"much good may it do them. I am not of\r\ntheir mind.\" Passive resisters were not encouraged in those days. But\r\nthe relations between vicar and lecturer continued strained, and the\r\nformer bethought him of his faithful clerk, Robert Langdon, as a helper\r\nin the ministry. He applied to the bishop to raise him to the diaconate,\r\nand this was done, Langdon being ordained deacon on 21 September, 1606,\r\nby William Cotton, Bishop of Exeter. The record of this notable event,\r\nthe ordination of a parish clerk, thus appears in the ordination\r\nregister of the diocese:\r\n\r\n     \"In festo Matthæi Apostoli Dominus Episcopus in ecclesia\r\n     parochiali de Silfertone xxi mo die Septembris 1606 ordines\r\n     sacros celebrando ordinavit, sequuntur Diaconi tunc et\r\n     ibidinem ordinati videlicet Robertus Langdon de Barnestapli.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: _Transactions of the Devonshire Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Science, Literature, and Art_, 1904, xxxvi. pp. 390-414.]\r\n\r\nLangdon remained parish clerk and deacon nineteen years, and the\r\nregister contained the record of his burial, \"Robert Langdon deacon 5th\r\nJuly 1625.\" He seems to have brought peace to the troubled mind of his\r\nvicar, whose tombstone declares:\r\n\r\n     \"Many are the troubles of the Righteous\r\n     But the Lord delivereth out of all.\"\r\n\r\nLangdon used to keep the registers, and he began to record in them a\r\nseries of notes on passing events which add greatly to the interest of\r\nsuch volumes. Thus we find an account of a grievous fire at Tiverton in\r\n1595, a violent storm at Barnstaple in 1606, and a great frost in the\r\nsame year; another fire at Tiverton in 1612, and the scraps of Latin\r\nwhich appear show that he was a man of some education.\r\n\r\nAnthony Baker reigned from 1625 to 1646, who had also been ordained\r\ndeacon prior to his appointment to Barnstaple, and belonged to an old\r\nyeoman family. He was popular with the people, who presented him with a\r\nnew gown. He saw the suspension of his vicar by the Standing Committee,\r\nand probably died of the plague in 1646, when the town found itself\r\nwithout vicar, deacon, or clerk. The plague was raging, people dying,\r\nand no one to minister to them. No clergyman would come save the old\r\nvicar, Martyn Blake, who was at length allowed by the Puritan rulers to\r\nreturn, to the great joy of the inhabitants. He appointed Symon Sloby\r\n(1647-81), but could not get him ordained deacon, as bishops and\r\nordination were abhorred and abolished by the Puritan rulers. Sloby was\r\nappointed \"Register of Barnestapell\" during the Commonwealth period. He\r\nsaw his vicar ejected and carried off to Exeter by some of the\r\nParliamentary troopers and subsequently restored to the living, and\r\nrecords with much joy and loyalty the restoration of the monarchy. He\r\nserved three successive vicars, records many items of interest,\r\nincluding certain gifts to himself with a pious wish for others to go\r\nand do likewise, and died in a good old age.\r\n\r\nRichard Sleeper succeeded him in 1682, and reigned till 1698. He\r\nconformed to the more modern style of clerk of an important parish, a\r\ndignified official who attended the vicar and performed his duties on\r\nSunday, occupying the clerk's desk. Of his successors history records\r\nlittle save their names. William Bawden, a weaver, was clerk from 1708\r\nto 1726, William Evans 1726 to 1741, John Taylor 1741 to 1760, John\r\nComer 1760 to 1786, John Shapcote 1786 to 1795, Joseph Kimpland 1795 to\r\n1798, who was a member of an old Barnstaple family and was succeeded by\r\nhis son John (1798-1832), John Thorne (1832-1859), John Hartnoll\r\n(1859-1883), and William Youings 1883 to 1901.\r\n\r\nThis is a remarkable record, and it would be well if in all parishes a\r\nlist of clerks, with as much information as the industrious inquirer can\r\ncollect, could be so satisfactorily drawn up and recorded, as Mr.\r\nChanter has so successfully done for Barnstaple. The quaint notes in the\r\nregisters written by the clerk give some sort of key to his character,\r\nand the recollections of the oldest inhabitants might be set down who\r\ncan tell us something of the life and character of those who have lived\r\nin more modern times. We sometimes record in our churches the names of\r\nthe bishops of the see, and of the incumbents of the parish; perhaps a\r\nlist of the humbler but no less faithful servants of the Church, the\r\nparish clerks, might be added.\r\n\r\nOften can we learn much from them of old-world manners, superstitions,\r\nfolk-lore, and the curious form of worship practised in the days of our\r\nforefathers. My own clerk is a great authority on the lore of ancient\r\ndays, of bygone hard winters, of weather-lore, of the Russian war time,\r\nand of the ways of the itinerant choir and orchestra, of which he was\r\nthe noted leader. Strange and curious carols did he and his sons and\r\nfriends sing for us on Christmas Eve, the words and music of which have\r\nbeen handed down from father to son for several generations, and have\r\nsomewhat suffered in their course. His grandson still performs for us\r\nthe Christmas Mumming Play. The clerk is seventy years of age, and\r\nsucceeded his father some forty years ago. Save for \"bad legs,\" the\r\ncurse of the rustic, he is still hale and hearty, and in spite of an\r\norgan and surpliced choir, his powerful voice still sounds with a\r\nresonant \"Amen.\" Never does he miss a Sunday service.\r\n\r\nWe owe much to our faithful clerks. Let us revere their memories. They\r\nare a most interesting race, and your \"Amen clerk\" is often more\r\ncelebrated and better known than the rector, vicar, patron or squire.\r\nThe irreverence, of which we have given many alarming instances, was\r\nthe irreverence of the times in which they lived, of the bad old days of\r\npluralist rectors and itinerant clerics, when the Church was asleep and\r\npreparing to die with what dignity she could. We may not blame the\r\nhumble servitor for the faults and failings of his masters and for the\r\ncarelessness and depravity of his age. We cannot judge his homely ways\r\nby the higher standard of ceremonial and worship to which we have become\r\naccustomed. Charity shall hide from us his defects, while we continue to\r\nadmire the virtues, faithfulness and devotion to duty of the old parish\r\nclerk, who retains a warm place in our hearts and is tenderly and\r\naffectionately remembered by the elder generation of English\r\nChurchpeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe passing of the parish clerk causes many reflections. For a thousand\r\nyears he has held an important position in our churches. We have seen\r\nhim robed in his ancient dignity, a zealous and honoured official,\r\nwithout whose aid the services of the Church could scarcely have been\r\ncarried on. In post-Reformation times he continued his career without\r\nlosing his rank or status, his dignity or usefulness. We have seen him\r\nthe life and mainstay of the village music, the instructor of young\r\nclerics, the upholder of ancient customs and old-established usages. We\r\nhave regretted the decay in his education, his irreverence and\r\nabsurdities, and have amused ourselves with the stories of his quaint\r\nways and strange eccentricities. His unseemly conduct was the fault of\r\nthe dullness, deadness, and irreverence of the age in which he lived,\r\nrather than of his own personal defects. In spite of all that can be\r\nsaid against him, he was often a very faithful, loyal, pious, and\r\nworthy man.\r\n\r\nHis place knows him no more in many churches. We have a black-gowned\r\nverger in our towns; a humble temple-sweeper in our villages. The only\r\ncivil right which he retains is that the prospectors of new railways are\r\nobliged to deposit their plans and maps with him, and well do I\r\nremember the indignation of my own parish clerk when the plans of a\r\nproposed railway, addressed to \"the Parish Clerk,\" were delivered by the\r\npostman to the clerk of the Parish Council. It was a wrong that could\r\nscarcely be righted.\r\n\r\nI would venture to suggest, in conclusion, that it might be worth while\r\nfor the authorities of the Church to consider the possibility of a\r\nrevival of the office. It would be a great advantage to the Church to\r\nrestore the parish clerk to his former important position, and to\r\nendeavour to obtain more learned and able men for the discharge of the\r\nduties. The office might be made again a sphere of training for those\r\nwho wish to take Holy Orders, wherein a young man might be thoroughly\r\neducated in the duties of the clerical profession. It would be an\r\nimmense assistance to an incumbent to have an active and educated layman\r\nassociated with him in the work of the parish, in teaching, in reading\r\nand serving in church, and in visiting the sick. Like the clerk of old,\r\nhe would be studying and preparing for ordination, and there could be no\r\nbetter school for training than actual parish work under the supervision\r\nof an earnest and wise rector.\r\n\r\nThe Church has witnessed vast changes and improvements during the last\r\nfifty years. The poor clerk has been left to look after himself. The\r\nrevival of the office and an improvement in the position and education\r\nof the holders of it would, I fully believe, be of an immense advantage\r\nto the Church and a most valuable assistance to the clergy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\nAbsolon, Chaucer's portrait of, 26\r\n  David, clerk of Great Yarmouth, 185\r\n\"Acts,\" a Christian name, 264\r\nAddison, on clerks, 64\r\nAdvent, a carol for, 168\r\n\"Ales,\" clerk's, 42\r\nAllington, Kent, 230\r\nAlnwick, Turner, clerk of, 232\r\n\"Amen\" epitaph, 97\r\n_Ancient Mysteries_, 137\r\nAndrews, W., _Curious Epitaphs_, 100\r\n  _Curiosities of the Church_, 188\r\nAntiquity of clerk's office, 16, etc.\r\nApostles, complimenting the, 265\r\nAppointment, the right of, 246\r\n_Aquæbajalus_, 27\r\nArms of the Company of Clerks, 111\r\n_Art of Politicks_, 184\r\nArt, the clerk in, 195, etc.\r\nAshford, Isaac, the story of, 68\r\nAston, Yorks, 5\r\nAstronomical clerks, 209, 258\r\nAtchley, Dr. Cuthbert, 49\r\nAtkinson, Rev.
