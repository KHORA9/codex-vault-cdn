To have interpreted one such literature and made it accessible\r\nto English-speaking people seems to me a sufficient result of a life.”\r\n\r\nIt seems, however, peculiarly appropriate that a history of Italian\r\nliterature should follow and should precede other and parallel\r\nhistories. Symonds himself had long before pointed out that no man,\r\nat least in a single work of moderate compass, can fully deserve\r\nthe credit of having unlocked Italian literature. The study of\r\nItalian letters, he had reminded us, cannot be profitably pursued by\r\nitself. The literature of Italy requires to be constantly considered\r\nin connection with other literatures, both those from which it is\r\nitself derived, and those which it has deeply influenced. It is more\r\nintimately affiliated to antiquity than any other European literature,\r\nand may indeed be regarded as a continuation or revival of the Latin.\r\nIts advent was long and unaccountably delayed--it is the youngest of\r\nall the chief European literatures; but when at length it did appear,\r\nits form, already classical, dispensed it from an infancy of rudeness\r\nand barbarism. It may be compared to Hermes, the youngest but most\r\nprecocious of the Gods; not, like Pallas, born adult, but equal to any\r\nachievement from the cradle:\r\n\r\n\r\n      _The babe was born at the first peep of day;\r\n        He began playing on the lyre at noon;\r\n      And the same evening did he steal away\r\n        Apollo’s herds._\r\n\r\nEntering at once upon a heritage of classical tradition, Italians\r\nbegan to teach foreign nations long before they found anything to\r\nlearn from them; and this influence is so large a part of the glory of\r\nItaly that her literature cannot be fully unlocked to the foreigner\r\nunless he is shown, not only what she has herself effected in letters,\r\nbut how greatly she has modified the intellectual development of\r\nother countries. She owes nothing to Chaucer, Spenser, or Milton;\r\nbut Chaucer, Spenser, and Milton are infinitely indebted to her.\r\nThe position she so long retained as the instructor and exemplar of\r\ncivilised nations invests her literature with an importance more\r\nconsiderable than that attaching to the merits of her individual\r\nauthors, illustrious as these are. Yet it is impossible to elucidate\r\nthis momentous department of the subject in a manual of four hundred\r\npages. All that can be done is to indicate by continual reference and\r\nallusion that the need exists, and must be satisfied elsewhere. The\r\ninfluence upon Italy herself of foreign writers, and of movements\r\ncommon to Europe in general, has required and received fuller treatment.\r\n\r\nOther circumstances, and these not attributable to the restricted\r\nscale of his undertaking, conspire to afflict the historian of Italian\r\nliterature with a feeling of insufficiency. From causes which will\r\nappear in the course of this history, many of the most gifted Italians\r\nwrote in Latin. From Petrarch down to Nicius Erythræus a succession of\r\nbooks which would have adorned the vernacular literature if they had\r\nbelonged to it, appeared in the common idiom of scholars. Petrarch’s\r\n_Canzoniere_, as respects mere dimension, is as nothing to the mass of\r\nhis Latin works. Politian writes just enough Italian to prove that he\r\nmight have revived Boccaccio or anticipated Ariosto. Pontano, one of\r\nthe brightest intellects of Italy, writes entirely in Latin. To exclude\r\nthe Latin books of such men entirely from consideration is impossible;\r\nbut they cannot be adequately treated in a professed history of\r\nvernacular literature; and much else of deep significance must be\r\npassed over without a hint of its existence.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance places the Italian mind at a disadvantage when\r\ncontemplated solely through a literary medium. Literature in Italy\r\nis a less exhaustive manifestation than elsewhere of the intellect\r\nof the nation. The intellectual glory of England, France, and\r\nGermany depends mainly upon their authors and men of science; their\r\nillustrious artists, the succession of great German composers since\r\nHandel excepted, are for the most part isolated phenomena. In the ages\r\nof Italian development, whether of the imitative arts or of music,\r\nartists far outnumber authors, and the best energies of the country are\r\nemployed in artistic production. Of this super-abundant vitality mere\r\nliterary history affords no trace. Michael Angelo, one of the greatest\r\nmen the world has seen, can here claim no more than a paragraph on the\r\nstrength of a handful of sonnets. It is indeed remarkable that out of\r\nthe nine Italians most brilliantly conspicuous in the very first rank\r\nof genius and achievement--Aquinas, Dante, Columbus, Leonardo, Michael\r\nAngelo, Raphael, Titian, Galileo, Napoleon--only one should have been\r\na man of letters. The reader, therefore, who may deem the field of\r\nItalian literature infertile in comparison with the opulence of England\r\nor France, must remember that it expresses a smaller proportion of the\r\ncountry’s benefaction to humanity. Yet Jowett is perfectly justified\r\nin claiming for the Italian a front place among the literatures of the\r\nworld, but only on condition that its great representatives shall be\r\nweighed rather than counted.\r\n\r\nThe comparative--though only comparative--paucity of authors in Italy\r\nis so far favourable to the historian working on a small scale, that it\r\nallows a more expansive treatment of the greatest men, and at the same\r\ntime the inclusion of minor writers not always of high distinction, but\r\nindispensable to the continuity of the narrative. This is essential\r\nin a book which does not profess to be a string of biographies, but a\r\nbiography of Italian Literature herself regarded as a single entity\r\nrevealed through a succession of personages, the less gifted among\r\nwhom may be true embodiments of her spirit for the time being. Many\r\nremarkable manifestations of the national intellect are, nevertheless,\r\nnecessarily excluded. Writers in dialect are omitted, unless when\r\nacknowledged classics like Meli or Belli. Academies and universities\r\nare but slightly mentioned. Theologians, jurists, and men of science\r\nhave been passed over, except in so far as they may also have been men\r\nof letters. There is, in fact, no figure among them like Luther, who,\r\nthough not inspired by the love of letters as such, so embodied the\r\nnational spirit and exerted so mighty an influence upon the language,\r\nthat he could no more than Goethe be omitted from a history of German\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nSome want of proportion may be charged against the comparatively\r\nrestricted space here allotted to Dante. It is indeed true that if\r\ngenius prescribed the scale of treatment, at least a third of the book\r\nought to have been devoted to him; but this very fact refutes the\r\ncensure it seems to support, since, the limits assigned admitting of no\r\nextension, all other authors must have suffered for the sake of one. In\r\na history, moreover, rather dealing with Italian literature as a whole\r\nthan with writers as individuals, the test is not so much greatness as\r\ninfluence upon letters, and in this respect Dante is less significant\r\nthan Petrarch and Boccaccio. Preceding the Renaissance, he could not\r\nprofoundly affect its leading representatives, or the succeeding\r\ngenerations whose taste was moulded by it; and although at all times\r\nadmired and venerated, it was only at the appearance of the romantic\r\nschool and the Revolution that he became a potent literary force.\r\nAnother reason for a more compendious treatment of Dante is that while\r\nin the cases of other Italian writers it is difficult to remedy defects\r\nby reference to any special monograph, English literature possesses\r\nseveral excellent handbooks to the Divine Comedy, resort to which would\r\nbe expedient in any case.\r\n\r\nThe books to which the writer has been chiefly indebted are enumerated\r\nin a special bibliography. He is obliged to Mr. W. M. Rossetti and\r\nto Messrs. Ellis and Elvey for permission to use the exquisite\r\ntranslations from the _Dante and his Circle_ of Dante Gabriel Rossetti,\r\ncited in the early chapters of the book. The graceful versions from\r\nBoiardo and other poets contributed by Miss Ellen Clerke have not, with\r\none exception, been previously printed. Where no acknowledgment of\r\nindebtedness is made, translations are by the author of the volume.\r\n\r\n                                                RICHARD GARNETT.\r\n_December 1897._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER                                                        PAGE\r\n\r\n        I.

The literature of Greece may appear an\r\nexception, but we know that the broad stream of Homeric song in which\r\nwe first behold it must have been fed by a number of rills which it has\r\nabsorbed into itself, and whose original sources lie beyond the range\r\nof scrutiny. In no literature is this general maxim better exemplified\r\nthan the Italian, if, at least, as the economy of this little history\r\ndemands, we restrict this appellation to its modern period. It might\r\nbe plausibly contended that the Latin and Italian literatures, like\r\nthe Roman and Byzantine empires, are, in truth, a single entity, but\r\nthe convenience of the student precludes a view in support of which\r\nmuch might be adduced by the critic and philologist. Defining Italian\r\nliterature, therefore, so as to comprise whatsoever is written in any\r\ndialect of that “soft bastard Latin” which bears the Italian name, and\r\nto exclude all compositions in a language which a Roman would have\r\ncalled Latin, we find none among great literatures whose beginnings\r\nare more humble and obscure, or, which at first seems surprising,\r\nmore recent. The perfection of form which the literature of Italy had\r\nattained while all others, save the Provençal, were yet devoid of\r\nsymmetry and polish, the comparative intelligibility of the diction\r\nof “Dante and his circle” at the present day, while the contemporary\r\nwriters in other tongues require copious glossaries, lead to the tacit\r\nand involuntary assumption of a long antecedent period of development\r\nand refinement which did not in fact exist. In truth, the earliest\r\nliterary compositions definable as Italian are scarcely older than the\r\nthirteenth century.\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, no other such example in history of the\r\nobliteration of literary taste and method as that which in Italy befell\r\none of the most gifted peoples of the world for nearly six hundred\r\nyears. After Boethius (about 530 A.D.) the little that is left of\r\nliterature becomes entirely utilitarian, and is, with rare exceptions,\r\nrestricted to theology, jurisprudence, and monkish chronicles. There\r\nis still much evidence that the Latin classical writers had not passed\r\nout of the knowledge of men; but--except when like Virgil they became\r\nheroes of popular legend--little that they exercised any appreciable\r\ninfluence upon men’s ideas and imaginations. One unfortunate precursor\r\nof the Renaissance, indeed, Vilgardus of Ravenna (about A.D. 1000),\r\nwas led by his admiration for the classics to disparage Christianity,\r\nand suffered death in consequence. As a rule, however, the Latin poets\r\nmerely served as a magazine of commonplace quotations and an arsenal\r\nof metrical rules, which some of the least degenerate writers of the\r\nperiod apply with considerable skill. The explanation of this paralysis\r\nof Latin literature in Italy, while Greek was still an efficient organ\r\nof thought in the Eastern Empire, is no doubt to be found in the fact\r\nthat it had never been a robust national growth. The property of the\r\nlearned and cultivated, it had taken no deep hold upon the mass of the\r\npeople; and when culture and learning perished amid the vicissitudes\r\nof barbarian conquest, it was only preserved, apart from the services\r\nof the Church, by the absolute necessity of maintaining some vestiges\r\nof law, physic, and divinity, and the impossibility of conveying\r\ninstruction in the debased dialects into which the old Latin language\r\nwas resolving itself.\r\n\r\nIt might have been expected, nevertheless, that these dialects would\r\nhave become the vehicles of popular legend and poetry, and that, as\r\nanciently in Greece, a literature would at length have been evolved\r\nfrom the tales of the story-tellers and the songs of the minstrels. The\r\nvery existence of vernacular minstrels and story-tellers is but matter\r\nof inference, the little which we possess in any sense referable to\r\nthis department being in Latin. The instances laboriously accumulated\r\nby Rubieri to prove the existence of popular poetry throughout the Dark\r\nAges seem to be all in this language; and centuries pass without any\r\nindication that the ancestors of Dante thought it possible to write in\r\nany other, and scarcely any that they cared for written composition at\r\nall, except as a medium for instruction in such knowledge as the age\r\npossessed, and the transaction of the ordinary business of life. The\r\nsymptoms of vitality became more evident after the Christian world had\r\nturned the corner of its first millennium. The eleventh century was in\r\nItaly an age of eminent theologians; it also beheld the musical reforms\r\nof Guido of Arezzo; and towards its conclusion poets of some note arose\r\nto chant in Latin hexameters the triumphs of Genoa and Pisa over the\r\nSaracens. Still, although, as has been well remarked, the enthusiasm\r\nfor the Crusades excited by itinerant preachers goes far to prove that\r\npublic addresses were delivered in the popular dialects, there is not a\r\ntrace of any written Italian language, or a hint of any such vernacular\r\nliterature as existed, if it hardly flourished, among the Germans, the\r\nFrench, and the Anglo-Saxons. When at length in the twelfth century\r\nPoetry unmistakably presents herself in the songs of the wandering\r\nstudents (_Goliardi_), her attire is still Latin. But it was much\r\nthat any class of society should now be making its own songs, and the\r\ntransition to a vernacular lyric was not long or difficult, although,\r\ninstead of taking birth among the people, it was fostered into life by\r\nthe patronage of Courts.\r\n\r\nThe first of the Latin nations to acquire a cultivated vernacular\r\nliterature was the Provençal. Many reasons, singly insufficient, but\r\ncumulatively of great force, may be adduced for this unquestionable\r\npriority. The language, which may be roughly but accurately described\r\nas a connecting link between French and Italian, as its Catalan and\r\nValencian congeners form one between French and Spanish, is better\r\nadapted for poetical composition than French; while, the Latin\r\ninfluence being less oppressively overwhelming than in the land of the\r\nRomans, it escaped the ban of provinciality which so long prohibited\r\nserious literary composition in the vernacular speech of Italy. Before\r\nthe demon of religious persecution was unchained by the Popes, the\r\ncountry enjoyed remarkable prosperity and tranquillity; the harsher\r\nfeatures of the feudal system were mitigated by industry and commerce,\r\nwhile the aristocratical organisation of society ensured literature\r\nthat patronage without which it could hardly have flourished in the\r\nabsence of a reading class.\r\n\r\nThe early poets of Provence were almost without exception the\r\nfavourites of princes and noblemen, whose exploits they celebrated,\r\nwhose enemies they satirised, whose own political course they\r\nsometimes inspired, and for whose gratification they vied with each\r\nother in improvised poetical contests (_tenzons_). Their strains,\r\nthough occasionally lighted up by some bright thought which Petrarch\r\nsubsequently did not disdain to appropriate, appear to us in general\r\nartificial and constrained. This is partly owing to the exaggeration\r\nof a virtue, that attention to “strictest laws of rhyme and rule,” in\r\nwhich, as an English poet truly declares, the bard finds “not bonds,\r\nbut wings.” But the cultivation of form is carried too far when it\r\nbecomes the end instead of the means, and the Provençal poets allowed\r\nthemselves to be seduced by their language’s unequalled facilities\r\nfor rhyming into an idolatry of the elaborate, which offered great\r\nimpediments to the simple expression of feeling. Some of their strophes\r\ncontain no fewer than twenty-eight verses, the same set of rhymes\r\nbeing carried through the whole stanza, and very frequently through\r\nthe entire poem. Out of four hundred pieces in a single manuscript\r\ncollection Ginguené found only two in the simple quatrain. It was\r\nfortunate for the Italians that their language, fluent and supple as it\r\nis, is incapable of such feats, and that, while adopting their lyrical\r\nmeasures from the Provençals, they could not, had they wished, cramp\r\nthemselves by the reproduction of the latter’s _tours de force_.\r\n\r\nIt is in the last quarter of the twelfth century that we find\r\nProvençal troubadours established at the Courts of the North Italian\r\nprinces, writing exactly such poems as they would have written at\r\nhome, and apparently just as well understood and equally popular,\r\na proof that neither in Provence nor in Italy had the culture of\r\n_belles lettres_ progressed beyond the highest circles. One or two\r\nof them occasionally mingled an Italian strophe with their Provençal\r\nsubstance, and at a somewhat later date Bonvesin da Riva and others\r\nwrote in a curiously mixed dialect of French and Italian. There is,\r\nhowever, no proper Italian literature until, about 1220, we suddenly\r\nfind a school of vernacular poetry flourishing at Palermo under the\r\npatronage of Frederick II., Emperor of Germany, an Italian on his\r\nmother’s side, and by his tastes and sympathies more of an Italian than\r\nof a German prince. The character of its productions is in general\r\nwholly Provençal, but the language is Italian of the Tuscan type, and\r\nit is a highly interesting question whether this was the case from the\r\nfirst, or whether the pieces as we possess them are adaptations from\r\nthe Sicilian dialect, which appears from contemporary prose monuments\r\nto have existed at the time nearly in its present form. We cannot\r\nattempt to decide the controversy, which does not affect the position\r\nof the pieces as the earliest undoubted examples of vernacular Italian\r\nliterature. Their poetical merit cannot in general be rated very\r\nhighly, and they contain hardly anything which might not have been\r\nwritten in Provence as well as in Sicily. Frederick himself was one of\r\nthe principal writers, and his canzone on his Lady in Bondage might\r\nappear to the English reader to possess considerable merit, but for the\r\nsuspicion that the great poet who translated it infused more poetical\r\ninspiration than he found. It would gain considerably in significance\r\nif Rossetti could be proved right in conjecturing that the immured lady\r\nis a symbol of Frederick’s empire in captivity to the Pope:\r\n\r\n      _Each morn I hear his voice bid them\r\n        That watch me, to be faithful spies\r\n        Lest I go forth and see the skies;\r\n      Each night to each he saith the same;--\r\n        And in my soul and in mine eyes\r\n      There is a burning heat like flame._\r\n\r\n      _Thus grieves she now; but she shall wear\r\n        This love of mine whereof I spoke\r\n        About her body for a cloak,\r\n      And for a garland in her hair,\r\n        Even yet; because I mean to prove,\r\n        Not to speak only, this my love._\r\n                                              --ROSSETTI.\r\n\r\nOf the few really Sicilian poets whose verses remain, the most\r\nremarkable is Cielo dal Carno, more commonly known from the misreading\r\nof an ill-written text as _Ciullo d’Alcarno_. The mention of Saladin\r\nhas till recently caused his _Dialogue between Lover and Lady_ to be\r\nascribed to the close of the twelfth century, but more unequivocal\r\nindications prove that it cannot have been written before 1231. It is\r\na piece of rare merit in its way, exempt from the insipid gallantry\r\nof the typical troubadour or minnesinger, and full of humour at once\r\nrobust and sly at the expense of slippery suitors and complacent\r\ndamsels. Nothing can be more delightfully naïve, for instance, than the\r\nknight’s unsolicited confession that he has stolen his Bible:\r\n\r\n      _Then, on Christ’s book, borne with me still\r\n        To read from and to pray\r\n      (I took it, fairest, in a church,\r\n        The priest being gone away)._\r\n                                               --ROSSETTI.\r\n\r\nSome of the nearly contemporary Tuscan poets may have belonged to\r\nFrederick’s circle, but it will be convenient to treat of them in\r\nthe next chapter among the precursors of Dante. Of the undoubted\r\nSicilian poets the most remarkable is Jacopo, the notary of Lentino,\r\ndepreciated by Dante on account of the rusticity of his style, a defect\r\nwhich disappears when he is rendered into another language. Rossetti,\r\nspeaking from Lentino’s mask, frequently thrills with strokes of true\r\nmagic, as when he names\r\n\r\n                                  _the song,\r\n      Sweet, sweet and long, the song the sirens know._\r\n\r\nIn some of Lentino’s sonnets also the germs and groundwork of Dante’s\r\nlyrical poetry are manifestly to be discovered.\r\n\r\nSomething should be said here of the lyrical forms used by the\r\nItalian poets of the best ages. The principal are the _canzone_, the\r\n_sonnet_, and the _ballata_. The canzone admits of several varieties of\r\nstructure, but usually commences with three unrhymed lines of eleven\r\nsyllables each, followed by three similar lines rhyming to their\r\npredecessors, a seventh of a discretionary number of syllables rhyming\r\nto the third and sixth, and five or six lines on a different rhyming\r\nsystem, short or long at the poet’s discretion, yet generally having\r\nthe last rhyme of the preceding system once repeated. The following\r\nstanza from Guido Cavalcanti may serve as an example:\r\n\r\n      _But when I looked on death made visible,\r\n        From my heart’s sojourn brought before mine eyes,\r\n        And holding in her[1] hand my grievous sin,\r\n      I seemed to see my countenance, that fell,\r\n        Shake like a shadow: my heart uttered cries,\r\n        And my soul wept the curse that lay therein.\r\n        Then Death: 'Thus much thine urgent prayer shall win:--\r\n      I grant thee the brief interval of youth\r\n        At natural pity’s strong soliciting.’\r\n      And I (because I knew that moment’s ruth\r\n      But left my life to groan for a frail space)\r\n      Fell in the dust upon my weeping face._\r\n                                              --ROSSETTI.\r\n\r\nBy this highly intelligent system the vagrant overgrowth of the\r\nProvençal stanza was pruned, and a lyrical form constituted, which\r\nwas unsurpassed for the combination of dignity with melodious grace.\r\nThe sonnet, unmatched as the most appropriate form for the harmonious\r\ndevelopment of a single thought, is one of Italy’s most precious\r\ngifts to the world of letters. It is too thoroughly naturalised in\r\nthis country to need detailed description; but the caution is not\r\nsuperfluous that a Shakespearian sonnet, a sonnet on the French model,\r\nor a very irregular sonnet, are strictly speaking not sonnets, but\r\nquatorzains; and that, although it would be pedantic to insist upon\r\nunvarying conformity to one of the four legitimate Italian structures\r\nof the sestet, they will seldom be widely departed from without injury\r\nto the music and architecture of the poem. The name _sonnetto_--a\r\nlittle sound--(cf. _sonnette_) admirably expresses the pealing effect\r\nof a well-manipulated sestet. The ballata is less confined by strict\r\nrules. “It is properly a lyric of two or more stanzas, in the first\r\nof which is set out the theme to be amplified in the following”\r\n(Boswell). It often terminates with an _envoy_ or quasi summing-up, as\r\nis frequently the case with the canzone also. The octave, familiar to\r\nEnglish readers as the metre of _Don Juan_, was generally reserved for\r\nnarrative poetry, but was also converted by the Sicilian poets into a\r\nlyrical form by merging the final couplet in the preceding sestet, as\r\ndescribed and exemplified by an English imitator:\r\n\r\n      _To thee, fair Isle, Italia’s satellite,\r\n        Italian harps their native measures lend;\r\n      Yet, wooing sweet diversity, not quite\r\n        Thy octaves with Italia’s octave blend.\r\n      Six streaming lines amass the arrowy might\r\n        In hers, one cataract couplet doth expend.\r\n      Thine lakewise widens, level in the light,\r\n        And like to its beginning is its end._\r\n\r\nThe _sestine_, a favourite form with the Provençals, and frequently\r\nused by Dante and Petrarch, is too complicated to be well understood\r\nwithout an example.\r\n\r\nThe same phenomenon is observed in Italian literature as in\r\nEnglish--the decay, after the language had begun to receive a high\r\nscholastic cultivation, of the simple spontaneous melody which had\r\noriginally characterised it. Italian prose probably never possessed the\r\nmajestic rhythm and sonorous cadences which came unsought to English\r\npoets of the time of Elizabeth and James; but Italian verse had its\r\nCampions, and these, like ours, left no successors. Without disparaging\r\nthe tunefulness of late writers like Chiabrera, it must still be owned\r\nthat this is in a measure artificial, and that the cause is the divorce\r\nof poetry and music. “It seems,” says Panizzi, “that the art of writing\r\nlines in which so much simplicity, smoothness, and strength were united\r\nto so delicate a proportion of sounds, is lost; and the reason is\r\nthat in our days canzoni and sonnets have nothing but the name of a\r\nsong.” The most melodious modern poetry, accordingly, is the portion of\r\nMetastasio’s plays which was actually written to be sung.\r\n\r\nIt is too early to speak as yet of Italian prose, of which no\r\nimportant example will be found until we reach Dante’s _Vita Nuova_,\r\nnear the end of the thirteenth century. It need only be remarked that\r\nthe grace of diction and the intricacy of metrical form which Italian\r\npoets had attained by the middle of the thirteenth century, show that\r\nthe language was already capable of fine prose, and that it was only\r\nneedful to dispel the superstition that serious subjects must be\r\ntreated in a learned tongue. Poetry prospered in the vernacular for the\r\nobvious reasons that the bards were in general ignorant of Latin, and\r\nthat if they had been acquainted with it their accomplishment would\r\nhave been wasted upon the lords and ladies for whom they principally\r\nwrote. The historical or philosophical writer, however, best reached\r\nthe classes he addressed through the medium of Latin. Hence, though\r\nfor different reasons, we observe in early Italian literature the\r\nsame phenomenon as in early Greek--a brilliant poetical activity\r\nin the almost total absence of prose composition. Yet, when Tuscan\r\nprose fairly begins, its productions are the purest examples of\r\ndiction--_testi di lingua_. This elegance testifies at once to the\r\ninnate refinement of the people and to the continuous operation of\r\nintellectual influences latent in the obscurest deeps of the Dark Ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Death (_La Morte_) being feminine in Italian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n                        THE EARLY ITALIAN LYRIC\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that the light thus kindled at the Sicilian Court\r\nshould spread to other parts of Italy, those especially where the\r\nvernacular tongue had already obtained the greatest degree of\r\nrefinement, and had developed most aptitude for the purposes of\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nDante, examining the dialects of Italy about the beginning of\r\nthe fourteenth century, affirms, indeed, that none of them can be\r\nidentified as the ideal or pattern language, which is the common\r\nproperty of educated Italians everywhere. But he evidently regards\r\nTuscany and Bologna as greatly in advance of other parts of Italy;\r\nand speaks of the impediments offered by the local speech of Ferrara,\r\nModena, and Reggio to the acquisition of pure Italian, in consequence\r\nof which, he says, these cities have produced no poets. Evidently,\r\ntherefore, some districts of Italy were more congenial than others to\r\nthe Court poetry transplanted from Sicily; and we find it flourishing\r\nexactly where, on Dante’s principles, this might have been expected,\r\nthat is, in Tuscany and the Romagna. About the same time, Antonio da\r\nTempo, a Paduan, writing on vernacular poetry, admits that “Lingua\r\nTusca magis apta est ad literam sive literaturam quam aliæ linguæ, et\r\nideo magis est communis et intelligibilis.” Almost the same words are\r\nemployed by an anonymous contemporary translator of the excerpts from\r\nthe gospels read as lessons for the day, with the addition that the\r\nTuscan speech is also the most agreeable. It is no wonder, therefore,\r\nthat many of the so-called Sicilian poets should have been Tuscans, or\r\nthat Tuscans at home should have been the first and chief cultivators\r\nof Italian poetry, so soon as this began to be written elsewhere than\r\nin Sicily, where the destruction of the Hohenstaufen dynasty put an end\r\nto it shortly after the middle of the thirteenth century. The transfer\r\nof literary composition from a Court circle to a republican community\r\nwas of high importance as a substitution of freer influences for those\r\nby which it had hitherto been moulded, and we speedily see the new\r\nliterature ceasing to be a mere amusement, and becoming in some measure\r\nan organ of thought and opinion. Political poems, satires, didactic\r\npieces, moral exhortations in verse become frequent. The literary worth\r\nof these, indeed, is not in general comparable to that of the amorous\r\nstrains which had formerly monopolised the field of poetry, but they\r\nshow that literature was beginning to lay hold of the national life,\r\nand bear within them the germs of better things.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable representative of the new tendency, who had\r\npreviously been a leading representative of the old, the most\r\ninfluential and the most conspicuous figure, indeed, among Dante’s\r\nforerunners, though far from the best poet, was GUITTONE DI AREZZO,\r\nborn probably about 1235. In his youth Guittone had been a love\r\npoet, after the manner of the troubadours, and obtained sufficient\r\ndistinction in the sonnet--to which, indeed, he seems to have first\r\ngiven what was to prove its durable form--to be afterwards regarded as\r\nthe precursor of Petrarch; but towards middle age, under the influence\r\nof religious emotion, he renounced the world, including his wife and\r\nfamily, and entered the military, not monastic, order of the Cavalieri\r\ndi Santa Maria, known, from the free-and-easy deportment of some of the\r\nbrethren, as the Jolly Friars, _Frati Gaudenti_. Guittone, however,\r\nseems to have been perfectly serious in the step he took. He condemned\r\nhis former course of life, renounced poetical pursuits, and dispensed\r\nprescriptions against secular lore and poetry in all their branches. He\r\ncontinued, nevertheless, to write in verse, and employed the Provençal\r\nmetrical forms as of old; but the themes of his muse are now morality,\r\nreligion, and, occasionally, politics. His sentiments entitle him to\r\nrespect, but his verse is dreary: Rossetti has been able to find only\r\none piece of his to repay translation, and this, even in Rossetti’s\r\nhands, does _not_ repay it. He was, nevertheless, much admired in his\r\nown day, and many contemporary poets were much influenced by him,\r\nespecially by his Latinisms; for Guittone was acquainted with such\r\nof the classical writers as were then accessible, and imitated their\r\nconstructions with servility and without judgment. He has a claim to\r\npriority as one of the first writers of Italian prose, on the strength\r\nof his epistles. They are otherwise only remarkable for the Latinised\r\naffectation of their style.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\nA much more important writer, in a purely literary point of view, and\r\nthe first Italian who can be esteemed a poet of high merit, is GUIDO\r\nGUINICELLI of Bologna (1220-1276), of whom little is known, except\r\nthat, like most men of light and leading in those unquiet times, he was\r\nbanished from his native city. His rank in Italian poetry is prominent,\r\nhe gave it a more serious and philosophical character than the\r\ntroubadours had been capable of imparting, and his amorous sentiment\r\nis more spirited and impressive. The masterpiece among Dante’s\r\nsonnets--_Tanto gentil e tanto onesta pare_--is undoubtedly adumbrated\r\nin one of Guinicelli’s. Dante calls him “the Sage,” and the canzone\r\nof the _Gentle Heart_, to which the great Florentine is alluding,\r\njustifies his admiration. The following is the first of six beautiful\r\nstanzas:\r\n\r\n      _Within the gentle heart Love shelters him,\r\n        As birds within the green shade of the grove.\r\n      Before the gentle heart, in Nature’s scheme,\r\n        Love was not, or the gentle heart ere Love.\r\n          For with the sun, at once,\r\n      So sprang the light immediately, nor was\r\n          Its birth before the sun’s.\r\n      And Love hath his effect in gentleness\r\n          Of very self; even as\r\n      Within the middle fire the heat’s excess._\r\n                                                     --ROSSETTI.\r\n\r\nMuch might be said of many other precursors of Dante, but space\r\nadmonishes us to restrict ourselves to two--Guido delle Colonne, a\r\nSicilian, chiefly known for his Latin romance on the Fall of Troy, but\r\nalso a vernacular lyrist of considerable merit; and Rustico di Filippo\r\n(1200-1274), eulogised by Brunetto Latini as a man of great worth, but\r\nwhose place among poets is mainly that of a satirist. Very biting are\r\nhis lines on a certain Messer Ugolino, a member by anticipation of what\r\nCarlyle called “the Heaven and Hell Amalgamation Society,” “who has\r\ngood thoughts, no doubt, if they would stay,” and\r\n\r\n      _Would love his party with a dear accord\r\n      If only he could once quite care for it._\r\n\r\nOne other writer among Dante’s predecessors may be mentioned, not for\r\nhis claims as a poet, but as a man so illustrious that he honoured\r\npoetry even by attempting what he was unqualified to perform. He is no\r\nless a man than St. Francis of Assisi, whose _Song of the Creatures_ is\r\npronounced by Renan “the most perfect expression given by the modern\r\nworld of its feeling for religion.”\r\n\r\nSome way past the middle of the century (1265) the greatest poet\r\nof Italy was born, and ere his eyes were closed Italian literature,\r\nin virtue of his works alone, had taken place among the great\r\nliteratures of the world. The distance between Dante and his immediate\r\ncontemporaries is much wider than usual in the case of similar groups\r\nof intellectual and gifted men, even if, leaving Dante’s great poem\r\nand his prose works out of sight, we consider him simply as a lyrist.\r\nYet they do constitute a group around him, and evince a general\r\ndevelopment both in thought and command of language, testifying to the\r\nupheaval which made a Dante possible. Many might be noticed did space\r\npermit, but it will be necessary to restrict ourselves to two typical\r\ninstances, with an additional section on the cultivators of humorous\r\nand satirical poetry, whose writings perhaps afford surer testimony\r\nthan those of more ambitious bards that poetry had actually entered\r\ninto the life of the people. The two men who, but for the existence of\r\nDante, would have stood forth as the poetical representatives of their\r\nage, are Guido Cavalcanti and Cino da Pistoia. By the time of their\r\nappearance, about 1290, Italian literature had become for the time\r\nentirely concentrated in Tuscany, and the phenomena which had attended\r\nthe similar isolation of Greek literary talent in Attica were destined\r\nto reproduce themselves.\r\n\r\nGUIDO CAVALCANTI would be memorable if only for his youthful friendship\r\nwith Dante, celebrated in many poems of both, and more especially in\r\nthe sonnet, so well known in England from Shelley’s more poetical than\r\naccurate version, in which Dante wishes for his company, along with\r\nLapo Gianni and their respective ladies, on a voyage with him and his\r\nBeatrice. Vanna, Cavalcanti’s lady-love in those days, is mentioned in\r\nanother sonnet as the chosen companion of Beatrice:\r\n\r\n                                _Each\r\n      Beside the other seemed a thing divine._\r\n\r\nCavalcanti had the reputation of a free-thinker, and the charge seems\r\nhardly refuted by his having made a pilgrimage to Compostella, even\r\nif he ever arrived there, which may be questioned. It is supposed to\r\nhave been on this journey that he made the acquaintance of the pretty\r\nMandetta of Toulouse, the theme of much of his verse. He was a leading\r\npersonage in the Florentine republic, and his strifes with inimical\r\nfactions eventually led to his exile to Sarzana, where he contracted a\r\ndisease which carried him off after his return to his native city.\r\n\r\nGuido’s merits as a poet were highly estimated by his contemporaries.\r\nDante mentions him in his treatise _De Vulgari Eloquio_ among the\r\nmasters of Italian literature, and declares that he has eclipsed\r\nGuido Guinicelli, whom also he greatly admired. Benevento da Imola,\r\nthe commentator on the _Divine Comedy_, names him along with Dante as\r\none of the two great lights of the age. That these praises were not\r\nundeserved will appear from a comparison of his lyrics with Dante’s,\r\nremembering that he was the older man and that the obligation was\r\nentirely on the side of the younger. Dante, especially in his sonnets,\r\nis continually borrowing thoughts which, whether original with\r\nCavalcanti or not, had been previously expressed by him. The expression\r\nis indeed greatly improved, but even Cavalcanti’s comparatively rude\r\nform is full of charm. In his _ballate_ he has the great merit of\r\nhaving exalted a popular carol to the dignity of literature with\r\nlittle injury to its simplicity. Of the canzoni ascribed to him only\r\ntwo are recognised as undoubtedly genuine. Both are instinct with the\r\nphilosophical spirit which he imported into poetry. The objections to\r\nthe genuineness of the others derived from external evidence do not\r\nalways appear very conclusive; but it must be admitted that there is\r\nan almost entire lack of external testimony in their favour. Four of\r\nthem, from one of which we have already borrowed a quotation, have\r\nbeen translated by Rossetti. The most celebrated of Guido’s genuine\r\ncompositions, the canzone beginning “_Donna mi prega; perch’ io voglio\r\ndire_,” was considered by his contemporaries the _ne plus ultra_ of\r\npoetry, but rather for its erudition than its strictly poetical merits:\r\nit had eight separate commentaries, which indeed were by no means\r\nsuperfluous.\r\n\r\nGuittoncino de’ Sinibuldi, commonly called CINO DA PISTOIA, a poet\r\nof somewhat later date (1270-1336), possessed less originality than\r\nGuido Cavalcanti, but having a better standard of taste, is perhaps\r\nmore generally pleasing. Like Cavalcanti, he was a man of varied\r\naccomplishments, and it is his special renown to have been among the\r\nfirst jurists of his time. Like Dante, he was exiled from his native\r\ncity, and went to Paris; he subsequently professed law in several of\r\nthe chief cities of Italy, and was eventually restored to his own. His\r\nverse, like Cavalcanti’s, bears a strong affinity to Dante’s lyrical\r\npoetry, and, in the opinion of so accomplished a judge as Lorenzo de’\r\nMedici, is even more completely divested of primitive rudeness. His\r\nmost celebrated composition is the canzone consoling Dante for the loss\r\nof Beatrice, from which we quote a stanza in Rossetti’s version:\r\n\r\n      _Why now do pangs of torment clutch thy heart,\r\n        Which with thy love should make thee overjoyed,\r\n        As him whose intellect has passed the skies?\r\n      Behold, the spirits of thy life depart\r\n        Daily to Heaven with her, they so are buoyed\r\n        With thy desire, and Love so bids them rise.\r\n        O God! and thou, a man whom God made wise,\r\n      To nurse a charge of care, and love the same!\r\n          I tell thee in His name\r\n      From sin of sighing grief to hold thy breath,\r\n          Nor let thy heart to death,\r\n      Nor harbour death’s resemblance in thine eyes.\r\n        God hath her with Himself eternally,\r\n        Yet she inhabits every hour with thee._\r\n\r\nHere, and in the remainder of the poem, there is a clear prefiguration\r\nof Petrarch, who admired Cino, and wrote a sonnet on his death. The\r\nfollowing is a favourable example of Cino’s own sonnets:\r\n\r\n      _Descend, fair Pity, veiled in mortal weed;\r\n        And in thy guise my messengers be dight.\r\n        Partakers to appear of virtuous might\r\n      That Heaven hath for thy attribute decreed.\r\n      Yet thou, ere on their errand these proceed,\r\n        If Love consent, I pray, recall and cite\r\n        My spirits all astray dispersed in flight,\r\n      That so my songs be bold to sue and plead.\r\n      Then, hast thou sight of ladies’ loveliness,\r\n        Thither accede, for I would have thee there,\r\n        And audience with humility entreat;\r\n      And charge my envoys, kneeling at their feet,\r\n        Their Lord and his desirings to declare:\r\n        Hear them, sweet Ladies, for their humbleness._\r\n\r\nSeveral other good poets, such as Lapo Gianni, Dino Frescobaldi, and\r\nGianni Alfani, would deserve notice in a more elaborate history.\r\nThey all wrought in the spirit of Cavalcanti and Dante himself,\r\nspiritualising the earthly passion of the troubadours, and endowing the\r\nladies of their songs with such superhuman perfections as to incur the\r\nrisk of appearing mere types of ideal virtue. We must, however, pass\r\nto a different order of poetry, the gay and satirical. Here Folgore\r\ndi San Geminiano is the leading figure. His political sonnets are\r\nvery forcible; but he is better known for two sets of sonnets on the\r\npleasures of the months and the days of the week, celebrating, not\r\nwithout an undercurrent of satire, the luxurious extravagance of a\r\nset of wild young men at Siena, who, another poet informs us, reduced\r\nthemselves to beggary thereby. Another humorous poet, justly defined by\r\nRossetti as the scamp of the Dante circle, is Cecco Angioleri, who is\r\nirreverent enough to call Dante himself a pinchbeck florin, and whose\r\nfavourite theme is his quarrels with his parents:\r\n\r\n      _My mother don’t do much because she can’t,\r\n        But I may count it just as good as done,\r\n      Knowing the way and not the will’s her want.\r\n        To-day I tried a kiss with her--just one--\r\n      To see if I could make her sulks avaunt;\r\n        She said, 'The devil rip you up, my son!'_\r\n                                              --ROSSETTI.[3]\r\n\r\nAnother class of poetry, forming a connecting link with prose, should\r\nbe briefly mentioned, the didactic. The _Tesoretto_ of BRUNETTO LATINI\r\n(1210-1294), celebrated as an encyclopædist of the knowledge of his\r\ntime, and still more so as the preceptor or rather Mentor of Dante,\r\ndescribes a vision in which the poet supposes the secrets of nature to\r\nbe revealed to him, and is interesting as in some measure prefiguring\r\nthe machinery of the _Divina Commedia_. Francesco Barberino, a notary,\r\nwrote both in prose and verse on the bringing-up of girls, and although\r\nhe is an indifferent writer his work is valuable as a picture of\r\nmanners. He seriously discusses the question whether girls should be\r\ntaught to read, and decides it in the negative. An anonymous poem\r\nentitled _La Intelligenzia_, treating philosophically of the emanation\r\nof Divine Wisdom, a conception resembling that of the Logos, attains\r\na higher grade of poetical merit, but the best passages appear to\r\nbe translated from the French and Provençal. The religious lyric of\r\nSt. Francis of Assisi and of the Umbrian school, more interesting in\r\na psychological than in a literary point of view, culminated about\r\nthe end of the thirteenth century in the lays of Jacopino di Todi,\r\nremarkable examples of impassioned mysticism, and sometimes of satiric\r\nforce. He is particularly interesting as a popular poet who owes\r\nnothing to culture, but derives all his inspiration from the ecstatic\r\ndevotion which in his day animated a large portion of the Italian\r\ncommon people. The same spirit inspired the _Rappresentazioni_ of a\r\nrather later period, which will be more appropriately considered along\r\nwith the Italian drama.\r\n\r\nDante’s prose works demand separate treatment; of earlier examples\r\nof prose there is very little to be said. Historians and theologians\r\ncontinued to compose in Latin, and the few writings in the vernacular\r\nwere chiefly translations from that language. The principal\r\ncontemporary book in Italian, the _Tesoro_ or great encyclopædia of\r\nBrunetto Latini, is an important monument of culture, but not of\r\nliterature. It was, moreover, originally composed in French.\r\n\r\nItalian literature had sprung up from nothingness and made enormous\r\nprogress during three-quarters of a century without having produced\r\na pout of the first or even of the second rank. There was no want of\r\nsingers; rather there seemed reason for apprehension lest, as Tansillo\r\ndeclared with truth in the Cinque Cento,\r\n\r\n      _The Muses’ troop an army had become,\r\n      And every hillock a Parnassus grown_--\r\n\r\na complaint anticipated by the anonymous writer of a clever _ballata_\r\nin the thirteenth century:\r\n\r\n      _A little wild bird sometimes at my ear\r\n        Sings his own verses very clear:\r\n      Others sing louder what I do not hear.\r\n      For singing loudly is not singing well;\r\n        But ever by the song that’s soft and low\r\n      The master-singer’s voice is plain to tell.\r\n        Few have it, and yet all are masters now,\r\n      And each of them can trill out what he calls\r\n      His ballads, canzonets, and madrigals.\r\n      The world with masters is so covered o’er,\r\n      There is no room for pupils any more._\r\n                                              --ROSSETTI.\r\n\r\nBut the great poet was about to arise who may almost be said to have\r\ncreated two literatures--his country’s and that specially devoted to\r\nhimself--and whose own works are such, that if every other production\r\nof Italian literature were to perish, it would, on their account alone,\r\ncontinue to deserve a place among the great literatures of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] The other prose Italian writings of approximate date are for the\r\nmost part either translations from the Latin, which do not enter into\r\nthe plan of this work, or novelettes, which will be more advantageously\r\nconsidered along with other works of their class. The origin of Italian\r\nprose would have to be carried considerably farther back if the _Carte\r\ndi Arborea_ in the public library of Cagliari were genuine, but they\r\nare unquestionably forgeries.\r\n\r\n[3] _Gin my seven sons were seven rats, Rinning over the castle wa’,\r\nAnd I mysel’ were the auld grey cat, Full soon would I worry them a’!_\r\n\r\n                                                        --OLD BALLAD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n                    DANTE’S LIFE AND MINOR WRITINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nCreditable as were their essays in the new literary instrument of\r\nthought, Dante’s predecessors can be regarded as his forerunners only\r\nin so far as they had helped to create an intellectual atmosphere\r\ncongenial to the special bent of his genius. The general character of\r\nthis may be defined as an alliance of the chivalrous and impassioned\r\nsentiment which had come down from the troubadours with the science\r\nof Aristotle and the thought of Aquinas. Guido Cavalcanti had shown\r\nhow these might be combined, and Dante followed in his steps without,\r\nperhaps, any clear consciousness of his own infinite superiority; of\r\nwhich, however, a well-known passage in the _Inferno_ seems to intimate\r\nthat he eventually came to entertain a sufficient notion.\r\n\r\nDANTE (DURANTE) ALIGHIERI was born at Florence in 1265, in the later\r\npart of May. The origin of his family is variously attributed to\r\nRome, Ferrara, Parma, and Verona. The first of his ancestors whom he\r\nmentions, Cacciaguida degli Elisei, a crusader in 1147, had bestowed\r\nhis wife’s surname of Alighieri upon his son, and it had continued in\r\nthe family. Dante’s relatives belonged to the Guelf party, and had had\r\ntheir share in the turmoils which for half a century had distracted\r\nFlorence no less than most other Italian cities. Of his boyhood we\r\nknow nothing, except that he lost his mother at an early age, and\r\nthat he profited by the instructions of the most learned of the\r\nFlorentines, Brunetto Latini. He appears to have taken part in several\r\nmilitary expeditions in his youth, and the glimpses of his personal\r\ncircumstances which he allows us in the _Vita Nuova_ exhibit him as a\r\nman of means, mingling on equal terms with the wealthy and polished\r\nsociety of prosperous Florence.\r\n\r\nIf our knowledge of Dante’s outer life at this period of his history\r\nis imperfect, it is otherwise with his spiritual life, which he has\r\nrevealed as no other could, in the above-mentioned _Vita Nuova_,\r\nwritten probably about 1292. This alone would have immortalised him\r\nas the author of the earliest modern book of its class--though it had\r\na prototype in the _Confessions of Saint Augustine_--and of the first\r\nbook of genius, or indeed of any real importance, written in Italian\r\nprose. Nothing can more forcibly proclaim the superiority of Dante’s\r\nmind than the uniqueness of his first production, unless it be the fact\r\nthat, high as is its place in literature, its chief interest for us is\r\nits concern with the man. It is simply the record of his attachment\r\nto a young lady whom he calls Beatrice, and whom Boccaccio enables us\r\nto identify with one whom we know from other sources to have actually\r\nexisted, Beatrice de’ Portinari. The notion that Beatrice is but an\r\nabstraction is utterly refuted, to adduce no other testimony, by Cino’s\r\nconsolatory poem on her death, quoted in the preceding chapter, and can\r\nonly be entertained by those who know little of love, or are entirely\r\npossessed by the passion for allegorising. If ever intense affection\r\nwas conveyed in intense language it is here, while at the same time the\r\npassion is purely Platonic, and there is no proof that it was in any\r\ndegree shared by its object, who appears to have been already married.\r\n\r\nDante’s biographers, except the late and untrustworthy Filelfo, cast\r\nno doubt on the real existence of Beatrice, and it would require very\r\nstrong evidence to overthrow the testimony of the chief among them,\r\nBoccaccio, who lived near Dante’s age, whose veneration for him was\r\nboundless, and who was personally acquainted with his daughter. We\r\ncan perceive no adequate reason for the scepticism of Scartazzini\r\nand others respecting Boccaccio’s trustworthiness. It is true that\r\nthe use which he made of his opportunities falls sadly below the\r\nmodern standard. Not only is he careless in collecting and verifying\r\nauthorities, but he makes no attempt to think himself back into the\r\nperiod of his hero. “Between him and the enthusiasms of the Middle\r\nAges,” says Symonds, “a ninefold Styx already rolled its waves.” Yet\r\nhis faults are offences of defect, not of excess in statement, though\r\nhe sins by introducing many useless disquisitions. His work exists in\r\ntwo shapes, a longer and a shorter recension. The latter is undoubtedly\r\nan unauthorised abridgment of the former, and the novel statements\r\nwhich it occasionally introduces can claim no authority from Boccaccio.\r\nIt seems to have been made by some Florentine who was offended by the\r\nseverity of Boccaccio’s strictures upon his city for her ingratitude to\r\nDante.\r\n\r\nThe biography by Filippo Villani, one of his _Lives of Illustrious\r\nFlorentines_, written about 1400, is mainly taken from Boccaccio,\r\nbut is important for its vindication of Dante from the charge of\r\nprofligacy, and for its particular details of his last illness. The\r\nvaluable life by Leonardo Bruni (1369-1414) is avowedly designed as a\r\nsupplement to Boccaccio, who in Bruni’s opinion had neglected weighty\r\nmatters for love stories and such-like frivolities. He therefore,\r\nwhile omitting all mention of Beatrice and the _Vita Nuova_, gives a\r\nmuch fuller account than Boccaccio of Dante’s share in the affairs of\r\nFlorence, and even cites an autograph letter of his, now lost like all\r\nothers. He is entitled to much respect as a sensible and impartial\r\nwriter, who took pains to obtain information; while the later mediæval\r\nbiographers, Manetti and Filelfo, have some literary merit, but no\r\nhistorical value. Of the other three it may be said that a statement\r\nin which any two of them agree may usually be received, and that the\r\nassertion of any one is entitled to a fair amount of credit when it\r\nis not contradicted by another’s. The absolute trustworthiness of the\r\nchronicle long attributed to Dinoi Campagni must now be given up;\r\nit is, nevertheless, most probably of sufficient antiquity to have\r\npreserved some authentic notices.\r\n\r\nNo biographer of Dante, however, could possibly have compared\r\nwith Dante himself, and it is much to be lamented that the entire\r\ndisappearance of what must have been for his time an extensive body\r\nof correspondence has deprived us of all autobiographic record except\r\nthe _Vita Nuova_, which, almost devoid of incident, paints the inner\r\nman with lively force. Except Shelley’s _Epipsychidion_, the world has\r\nnothing to set beside this dithyrambic of purely Platonic passion.\r\nWe must recur to it, and need only here fix the death of Beatrice,\r\none of the great landmarks of Dante’s life, at June 9, 1290. Somewhat\r\nmore than a year afterwards we find Dante moved, as a noble soul might\r\nwell be, not by the attractions but by the spiritual sympathy of a\r\ncompassionate lady. It is impossible to entertain the least doubt of\r\nthe reality of an episode described by himself with such tenderness of\r\nself-excuse and poignancy of self-reproach, but to admit it is to admit\r\nthe actuality of all the rest of the _Vita Nuova_:\r\n\r\n      _The salt stream that did sorrowfully flow,\r\n        Speeded, ye Eyes, from your deep springs apace,\r\n        Gave marvel unto all who such long space\r\n      Beheld you weeping, as yourselves do know.\r\n      Now fear I that all such ye would forgo,\r\n        If I upon my own part would be base,\r\n        And not all shift and subterfuge displace,\r\n      Reminding you of her who made your woe.\r\n      Your levity lays load of heavy thought\r\n        Upon me, sore disquieted with dread\r\n        Of her who looks on you in wistful wise.\r\n      By nothing less than Death should you be wrought\r\n        E’er to forget your Lady who is dead;\r\n        Thus saith my heart, and afterward it sighs._\r\n\r\nDante appears to say that he entirely overcame this rather regrettable\r\nthan reprehensible lapse from his ideal, and we believe him. If so, the\r\npitiful lady cannot be identified with Gemma Donati, whom, at latest in\r\n1293, if she had really borne him seven children by 1300, he married by\r\nthe persuasion of his friends. The _Vita Nuova_ was in all probability\r\nwritten by this time, and from its conclusion we learn that Dante was\r\neven then preparing to celebrate Beatrice in the _Divina Commedia_. It\r\nis therefore exceedingly improbable that he would have wedded one at\r\nall likely to impair or efface the freshness of her image in his soul;\r\nand though his union with Gemma was apparently untroubled by discord,\r\nit probably lacked all consecration but the ceremonial. It was brought\r\nto a close by Dante’s exile from his native city in 1301. Gemma and the\r\nchildren did not accompany him, and he never saw them more. The reason\r\nis not difficult to discover: it prefigured the case of Milton. Gemma’s\r\nfamily, the Donati, had come to belong to a party opposed to Dante.\r\nThe interests of her numerous children, mostly of very tender age,\r\nundoubtedly counselled Gemma to cleave to the winning side, and she\r\ncan scarcely be blamed if she declined to forsake her blood relations\r\nfor a husband whom she had probably found unsympathetic. Whether Dante\r\napproved her course, or rejoiced in his liberty (Short-sighted Devil,\r\nnot to take his spouse!), or was simply choked by indignation, he never\r\nhonours or dishonours her by a single word. Gemma Donati’s portrait\r\nhangs in the gallery of poets’ wives, like Marshal Marmont’s in the\r\ngallery of French marshals, covered by a veil of crape.\r\n\r\nFew of the more distinguished Italian men of letters have been able to\r\nkeep themselves clear of public employment. Dante’s wealth and social\r\neminence in the days of his prosperity did not allow him to decline the\r\ninvidious office of Prior, to which he was raised in 1300. It was only\r\ntenable for two months, but this was long enough for his ruin. Florence\r\nwas then rent by dissensions between two factions, the Whites and\r\nBlacks. The Government, by Dante’s courageous and probably wise advice,\r\nresolved to banish the leaders of both. As the chiefs of the Guelfic\r\nBlacks were Dante’s own connections, the Donati, while the Ghibelline\r\nWhites included Guido Cavalcanti, his most intimate friend, his counsel\r\nmust have been patriotic and disinterested. Unfortunately, it was not\r\nunflinchingly carried out, some of the Whites being shortly afterwards\r\nallowed to return. Pope Boniface VIII., fearing that the Ghibelline or\r\nImperialist party would thus obtain the upper hand in the city, incited\r\nCharles de Valois, brother of the French King, Philip the Fair, whom he\r\nhad allured into Italy to attack the King of Naples, to make himself\r\nmaster of Florence. This he accomplished, and the consequent return of\r\nDante’s adversaries led to the sacking of his house, the ruin of his\r\nfortune, and his life-long exile from his native city. He was at the\r\ntime absent on an embassy at the Papal Court, from which he retired to\r\nArezzo, where the other exiles had assembled, and must henceforth be\r\nreckoned among the Ghibellines.\r\n\r\nFor some years Dante participated in their endeavours to reinstate\r\nthemselves by force; but eventually, well-nigh as disgusted with his\r\nfriends as with his enemies, scorning the ignominious terms on which\r\nalone return would have been permitted, and especially discouraged by\r\nthe failure of the Emperor Henry VII., whose advent to Italy he had\r\nwelcomed with enthusiasm, he became a wanderer among the courts of\r\nthe princes and nobles of Northern Italy, generally finding honour\r\nand protection, which he frequently repaid by diplomatic services.\r\nThere seems no doubt of his having visited Paris and studied in\r\nthe University. The alleged extension of his journey to Oxford\r\nis unsupported by convincing evidence, but is not impossible or\r\nimprobable. A writer near his own day seems to assert that he had\r\nbeen in England. During all this time, like his ancient prototype\r\nThucydides, he was devoting himself to his immortal work, which,\r\npublished as the respective parts were completed, brought him celebrity\r\nand wondering reverence even in his lifetime. His most distinguished\r\npatron in his later years was Cane della Scala, surnamed the Great,\r\nLord of Verona, from whose court he retired in 1320 to that of Guido\r\nNovello da Polenta, at Ravenna. In the following year he undertook a\r\nmission to Venice, and there contracted a fever, which, aggravated it\r\nis said by the inhospitality of the Venetians in compelling him to\r\nreturn by land, carried him off on September 14, 1321, shortly after\r\nhe had completed his great epic. His funeral obsequies were celebrated\r\nwith magnificence; but political troubles delayed for a hundred and\r\nsixty years the erection of the monument ultimately raised by the piety\r\nof Cardinal Bembo’s father, then governing Ravenna for the Venetians,\r\nand inscribed with six rhyming Latin verses attributed without adequate\r\nevidence to Dante’s own pen, but sufficiently ancient to have been\r\nexpanded by Boccaccio into a noble sonnet:\r\n\r\n      _Dante am I, of deepest lore in song\r\n        Hierophant, elected to combine\r\n        Inheritance in Art with Nature’s sign,\r\n      Accounted miracle all men among.\r\n      Wings of Imagination sure and strong\r\n        Bore me through worlds infernal and divine,\r\n        And gave to verse immortal to consign\r\n      What doth to Earth or doth to Heaven belong.\r\n      Bright Florence brought me forth, but her fond son\r\n        To bitter exile drove, step-mother made\r\n        By guile of tongues malevolent and base.\r\n      Ravenna sheltered me; in her is laid\r\n        My dust; my spirit thitherward has gone\r\n        Where Wisdom reigns, and Envy hath not place._\r\n\r\nIt is usual to commence a review of an author’s productions by his\r\nmost important work; but the _Divina Commedia_ requires a chapter to\r\nitself, and precedence must consequently be given to Dante’s minor\r\nwritings. Of these the _Vita Nuova_ stands first both in time and in\r\nimportance. It is epoch-making in many ways, as the first great example\r\nof Italian prose, the first revelation of the genius of the greatest\r\nmediæval poet, and the incarnation of that romantic conception of ideal\r\nlove by which the Middle Age might fairly claim to have augmented the\r\nheritage bequeathed by antiquity. The main note of Dante’s genius here\r\nis its exquisite and unearthly spirituality, which, indeed, is visible\r\nin much of the poetry and art of the time, but attains its most intense\r\nexpression in him. Something like it has occasionally been seen since,\r\nas in John Henry Newman; but it is in our day too much out of keeping\r\nwith the legitimate demands of a busy and complicated society to occur\r\nexcept as a temporary and individual phenomenon.\r\n\r\nNothing is more remarkable in a composition apparently so fanciful than\r\nthe entire sincerity and straightforwardness of the _Vita Nuova_: grant\r\nthat Beatrice was a real person, and it is impossible to doubt the\r\nliteral truth of the entire narrative. This is the more extraordinary\r\nin consideration of the impersonality alike of the enamoured poet and\r\nof the object of his passion. Dante, indeed, speaking throughout in\r\nhis own character, cannot help portraying himself in some measure,\r\nthough our conception of him is probably largely made up of involuntary\r\nassociations with the more palpable Dante of the _Divina Commedia_. But\r\nBeatrice remains what he meant her to be, a spiritual presence, visible\r\nbut intangible. No heroine of fiction conveys a stronger impression of\r\nperfection; but we see her as Andromeda saw Medusa, merely reflected in\r\nthe mind of her lover.\r\n\r\nMore extraordinary works than the _Vita Nuova_ have been composed\r\nat even an earlier age, but there is perhaps no other book in the\r\nworld in which a young man appears as asserting by his first attempt\r\nso unchallenged a superiority over predecessors and contemporaries,\r\nwith whom he has nevertheless much in common. The evolution of Italian\r\npoetry has up to this point proceeded gradually and systematically;\r\nall of a sudden it makes a bound, and seems as it were to have\r\nsprung across a chasm. The prose is of more equable desert than the\r\ninterspersed poetry, some of which is inferior; while, on the other\r\nhand, the best poetry far transcends the prose. The finest among the\r\nsonnets and canzoni, if sometimes rivalled, have not hitherto been\r\nsurpassed in Italian literature, while the most famous of the former\r\nstill stands at the head of its own class:\r\n\r\n      _So goodly and so seemly doth appear\r\n        My Lady, when she doth a greeting bring,\r\n        That tongue is stayed, silent and quivering,\r\n      And eye adventures not to look on her.\r\n      She thence departeth, of her laud aware,\r\n        Meek in humility’s apparelling;\r\n        And men esteem her as a heavenly thing\r\n      Sent down to earth a marvel to declare.\r\n      Whoso regardeth, so delightedly\r\n        Beholds, his eyes into his heart instil\r\n        Sweet only to be known by tasting it;\r\n      And from her face invisibly doth flit\r\n        A gentle spirit Love doth wholly fill,\r\n        That to the soul is ever saying, Sigh._\r\n\r\nThe length of Italian canzoni renders it extremely difficult to do\r\nthem justice in a work of necessarily contracted limits. Two stanzas,\r\nhowever, of Dante’s canzone on the death of his lady are, as it were,\r\na little poem complete in themselves, and may be cited in Rossetti’s\r\nmatchless version:\r\n\r\n      _I was a-thinking how life fails with us\r\n      Suddenly after such a little while;\r\n      When Love sobbed in my heart, which is his home.\r\n      Whereby my spirit waxed so dolorous\r\n      That in myself I said, with sick recoil:\r\n      'Yea, to my Lady too this Death must come.’\r\n      And therewithal such a bewilderment\r\n      Possessed me, that I shut mine eyes for peace;\r\n      And in my brain did cease\r\n      Order of thought, and every healthful thing.\r\n      Afterwards, wandering\r\n      Amid a swarm of doubts that came and went,\r\n      Some certain women’s faces hurried by,\r\n      And shrieked to me, 'Thou too shalt die, shalt die!'_\r\n\r\n      _Then saw I many broken, hinted sights\r\n      In the uncertain state I stepped into.\r\n      Meseemed to be I know not in what place,\r\n      Where ladies through the streets, like mournful lights,\r\n      Ran with loose hair, and eyes that frightened you\r\n      By their own terror, and a pale amaze:\r\n      The while, little by little, as I thought,\r\n      The sun ceased, and the stars began to gather,\r\n      And each wept at the other;\r\n      And birds dropped in mid flight out of the sky,\r\n      And earth shook suddenly,\r\n      And I was 'ware of one, hoarse and tired out,\r\n      Who asked of me, 'Hast thou not heard it said?\r\n      Thy lady, she that was so fair, is dead’._\r\n\r\nAlthough the _Vita Nuova_ is essentially true history, the same\r\ncannot be said of a later work preferred to it by the author himself,\r\nalbeit posterity has reversed his judgment. This is the _Convito_,\r\nor _Banquet_, in which Beatrice appears as an allegory of divine\r\nphilosophy. The process of this mutation is not difficult to discover.\r\nNot long after her death, Dante, as he tells us at the end of the _Vita\r\nNuova_, had resolved, under the influence of a wondrous vision, “_di\r\ndire di lei quello che mai non fu detto d’alcuna_.” The mortal maiden\r\nthus necessarily becomes a type of supernatural glory and perfection,\r\nas we see her in the _Divina Commedia_, and the metamorphosis\r\ninevitably extends to the lyrics in which Dante celebrates her. She is\r\nno longer Beatrice de’ Portinari, but Philosophy, and unfortunately\r\nin too many instances Dante’s poetry has become philosophy also.\r\nThe nobility of the form still assures it pre-eminence over all\r\ncontemporary verse but the author’s own; but the substance is often\r\nmere reasoning in rhyme. Two canzoni, however, are of distinguished\r\nbeauty, “_Voi ch’ intendendo il terzo ciel movete_” (translated by\r\nShelley), and “_Tre donne intorno al cor mi son venute_,” which\r\nColeridge says, in 1819, he is at length beginning to understand after\r\nreading it over twelve times annually for the last fourteen years.\r\n“Such a fascination had it in spite of its obscurity!”\r\n\r\nThe former of these pieces is shown by internal evidence to have been\r\nwritten as early as 1295, and the latter was composed after Dante’s\r\nbanishment, to which period most of the other canzoni and the prose\r\ncommentary probably belong. This commentary constitutes the substance\r\nof the work. It was intended to have expounded fourteen canzoni,\r\nbut treats only of three, apart from a general introduction. More\r\nremarkable, perhaps, than the philosophical subtleties of which it\r\nconsists, is Dante’s appeal to a new public. He writes no longer for\r\nliterary circles, but for the world of persons of worth wherever found,\r\nespecially persons of rank. Hence the treatise is necessarily composed\r\nin Italian, which has the good effect of drawing from Dante a spirited\r\nvindication of his native tongue. It was probably completed up to the\r\npoint where the author left it by 1308 or 1309. The exceedingly corrupt\r\ntext has been revised by the last editor, Dr. Moore, upon the authority\r\nof two manuscripts in England.\r\n\r\nThe literary merits of the Italian language are more fully expounded\r\nin another work of Dante’s, which, however, he composed in Latin,\r\nthat his arguments might reach those who would not have condescended\r\nto read the vernacular. The _De Vulgari Eloquio_, originally entitled\r\n_De Eloquentia Vulgari_, or _Of the Vulgar Tongue_, is shown by\r\nhistorical allusions to have been composed by 1304. Like the _Convito_\r\nit is unfinished, only two books of the four of which it was to have\r\nconsisted having been written. Dante’s conception of the capabilities\r\nof his native tongue does him honour, even though he restricts the\r\nnumber of subjects adapted to it, and would deny its use to all but\r\ngifted writers. It is a still higher honour to have recommended it\r\nmore effectually by his example than by his reasonings, which, as was\r\ninevitable in his age, frequently rest upon entirely fanciful and\r\nvisionary data. His account, nevertheless, of the Italian dialects as\r\nthey existed in his day, and his precepts on the metrical structure of\r\nItalian poetry, which he seems not to have then contemplated as capable\r\nof existing apart from music, retain a substantial value for all time.\r\n\r\nThe hopes founded upon the appearance of the Emperor in Italy in 1311\r\nprobably induced Dante to publish a work written some years previously,\r\nhis treatise _De Monarchia_, embodying the best mediæval conception\r\nof the spheres of temporal and spiritual government upon earth. So\r\npowerfully had the universality of Roman sway impressed men’s minds,\r\nthat the Roman people were believed to have obtained the empire of\r\nthe earth by the donation of Heaven, and the Emperor of Germany was\r\nregarded as their lawful representative. This belief, so strange to us,\r\nwas, nevertheless, salutary in its time, by repressing the champions of\r\nuniversal despotism who made the Pope the fountain of secular as well\r\nas spiritual authority. By numerous arguments satisfactory to himself,\r\nbut which would now be considered entirely irrelevant, Dante proves\r\nthat universal monarchy is a portion of the Providential scheme, that\r\nthe Romans possessed by divine appointment jurisdiction over the entire\r\nearth. The inheritance of this prerogative by the Emperor of Germany is\r\ntaken for granted, and it is next demonstrated that the Emperor does\r\nnot derive his authority from the Church, any more than the Church\r\nhers from the Emperor. Yet Cæsar is to be reverent to Peter, as the\r\nfirst-born son to his father. There is no trace of religious heterodoxy\r\nin the treatise, though nothing can be more uncompromising than its\r\nlimitation of the Papal authority to its legitimate sphere.\r\n\r\nThe amount of fugitive poetry ascribed to Dante is inconsiderable.\r\nBruni, in his biography, remarks that there are two classes of\r\npoets--those who sing by inspiration and those who compose by art--and\r\nthat Dante belongs to the second. It cannot be admitted that Dante\r\nwas devoid of inspiration, but it is certainly true that he was one\r\nof those who possess a special power of regulating this divine gift.\r\nA Shelley or a Coleridge must write when the impulse seizes him; but\r\na Milton, with the conception of _Paradise Lost_ in his mind, can\r\ndefer putting pen to paper for seventeen years, and, with consummate\r\nlyric power, is but unfrequently visited by the lyric impulse. Dante,\r\nso marvellously similar to Milton in many respects, also, if we may\r\ntrust his account of the genesis of the pieces in the _Vita Nuova_,\r\nbut seldom found himself under an irresistible impulse to lyrical\r\ncomposition. Something suggests to him that a sonnet or a canzone would\r\nbe expedient or decorous; he plots it out, and fills up the outline\r\nwith unerring fidelity to his first conception. The gigantic plan of\r\nthe _Divine Comedy_ is similarly carried out without interruption or\r\nmisgiving; and but for the death of Beatrice, it is by no means certain\r\nthat it would have existed, any more than that Milton would have\r\nwritten _Comus_ if the noble children had never been lost in the wood.\r\n\r\nA poet of this stamp was not likely to enrich literature with much\r\nfugitive verse. A few occasional poems glitter here and there, to\r\nemploy Wordsworth’s simile, like myrtle leaves in his chaplet of bay.\r\nThe most remarkable among them is a sestine, the finest example of its\r\nartificial and elaborate class, and superbly translated by Rossetti;\r\nthis and other pieces are supposed to refer to a certain Pietra,\r\notherwise unknown. These poems seem to breathe the language of genuine\r\npassion, but are too few and of too uncertain date to contribute\r\nmuch to the solution of the question whether Dante was, as Boccaccio\r\nasserts, remarkable for susceptibility to female charms, or a paragon\r\nof continence, as Villani will have him. It is at least certain that,\r\nafter Beatrice, no woman exercised any noteworthy influence upon his\r\nwritings. He moves through life a great, lonely figure, estranged from\r\nhuman fellowship at every point: a citizen of eternity, misplaced\r\nand ill-starred in time; too great to mingle with his age, or, by\r\nconsequence, to be of much practical service to it; too embittered and\r\naustere to manifest in action the ineffable tenderness which may be\r\nclearly read in his writings; one whose friends and whose thoughts are\r\nin the other world, while he is yet more keenly alive than any other\r\nman to the realities of this; one whose greatness impressed the world\r\nfrom the first, and whom it does not yet fully know, after the study of\r\nsix hundred years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n                           THE DIVINE COMEDY\r\n\r\n\r\nTo have assumed a position so far in advance of, and so decisively\r\ndiscriminated from, that of any of his contemporaries, as in the _Vita\r\nNuova_, would alone have ensured Dante immortality as a poet. But his\r\nlyrical works are to his epic as Shakespeare’s sonnets to Shakespeare’s\r\ndramas.\r\n\r\nAny narrative in verse not familiar or humorous, nor of extreme\r\nbrevity, may be entitled an epic; although we might do well to\r\nnaturalise, as we have done in the case of _idyll_, the pretty Greek\r\nword _epyll_ to denote a narrative composition of such compass as\r\nKeats’s _Eve of St. Agnes_ or Wordsworth’s _Laodamia_. But there are at\r\nleast three classes of epics, excluding the merely romantic like the\r\n_Orlando_, and the mock-heroic, from consideration. The most important\r\nin every point of view is the national, originally not the work of\r\na man but of a people; sometimes, as in the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_,\r\nindebted for its final form to the shaping hand of the most consummate\r\ngenius; sometimes, as in the Finnish _Kalevala_, an agglomeration of\r\nlegends, united by community of spirit, but not fashioned into an\r\nartistic whole. At the remotest point from these stands the artificial\r\nepic, like the _Teseide_ of Boccaccio or the _Jason_ of William Morris,\r\nwhere the poet has selected for its mere picturesqueness a subject\r\nwhich stands in no vital relation to himself and his times; and such\r\nepics are necessarily the most numerous.\r\n\r\nYet there is an intermediate class of epic, partly national, partly\r\nartificial, where the poet, conscious of a high patriotic purpose,\r\nhas, like Virgil and Camoens, sung the glories of his country at their\r\nzenith; or, like Lucan, actually related contemporary history; or, like\r\nShelley in the _Revolt of Islam_, bodied this forth under the veil of\r\nallegory; or, like Tasso, embalmed ere too late the feeling of an age\r\npassing away. Two great epic poets of the intermediate class have done\r\nmore than this: they have preserved and expressed the sentiment of\r\ntheir age, its replies to the deepest questions which man can propound;\r\nhave clothed these abstractions with form, colour, and music, and have\r\nlent fleeting opinion an adamantine immortality. These are Dante and\r\nMilton.\r\n\r\n“Dante,” says Shelley, “was the second epic poet, that is, the second\r\npoet the series of whose creations bore a defined and intelligible\r\nrelation to the knowledge and sentiment and religion of the age in\r\nwhich he lived. Milton was the third.” Hence Shelley in another place\r\ncalls Milton “the third among the sons of light.” Both these great men,\r\nin truth, versed in all the learning of their ages, and entertaining a\r\nconviction of the indefeasible truth of what they believed themselves\r\nto know which no successor will be able to share, applied themselves\r\nto embody these beliefs in works of genius. Even as great empires have\r\nvanished from the earth, and left nothing but the works of art which\r\nwere not the greatness itself but merely its testimonies and symbols,\r\nso here the opinions have gone while the works remain. It almost seems\r\na law that every great poem which thus resumes the thought of an age\r\nshall be a song, not of Carlyle’s phœnix “soaring aloft, hovering with\r\noutstretched wings, filling earth with her music,” but rather of the\r\nsame phœnix “with spheral swan-song immolating herself in flame, that\r\nshe may soar the higher and sing the clearer.” Homer’s theology, we may\r\nbe sure, was already obsolete for the higher Greek mind when, or not\r\nlong after,\r\n\r\n                _The Iliad and the Odyssee\r\n      Rose to the swelling of the voiceful sea._\r\n\r\nOur own national epic, Shakespeare’s series of historical plays, could\r\nnot be written until the state of society it depicted was ceasing to\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nDante himself has told us the origin of his poem. In the last sonnet of\r\nhis _Vita Nuova_ he represents himself as having in thought followed\r\nBeatrice from earth to heaven:\r\n\r\n      _Beyond the sphere that doth all spheres enfold\r\n        Passes the sigh that from my heart takes flight,\r\n        By weeping Love with new perception dight\r\n      Sure way to the ethereal vault to hold;\r\n      Then having won unto that height untold,\r\n        Of Lady throned in honour hath he sight,\r\n        Resplendent so, that by the vesturing light\r\n      The spirit peregrine doth her behold.\r\n      So seen, that when he doth report the same,\r\n        I miss his sense, so subtle doth it seem\r\n        Unto the grieving heart that makes demand;\r\n      Vet know I that my Lady is his theme,\r\n        For oft he nameth Beatrice’s name,\r\n        And then, dear Ladies, well I understand._\r\n\r\nHere is the germ of the _Paradiso_, at all events; but, to preclude\r\nall misapprehension, Dante adds: “After this sonnet there appeared to\r\nme a wondrous vision, wherein I beheld things which made me resolve to\r\nsay no more concerning my Blessed One until I could treat of her more\r\nworthily. And that I may attain unto this I study with all my might, as\r\nshe truly knoweth. Wherefore if it shall be the pleasure of Him by whom\r\nall things live that my life shall yet endure for some years, I hope\r\nto say concerning her that which has never been said concerning any\r\nwoman.” The _Vita Nuova_ is believed to have been written about 1294.\r\nAt this time, therefore, Dante was meditating a poetical apotheosis of\r\nBeatrice on a scale surpassing anything attempted before, although the\r\nnatural inference from his words would seem to be that he had not yet\r\nbegun to write.\r\n\r\nHe would probably at first contemplate nothing more than the expansion\r\nof the thought of his sonnet into a vision somewhat resembling that of\r\nLaura in Petrarch’s _Trionfi_; but ere long he might say to himself,\r\ninverting the question which Ellwood the Quaker addressed to Milton:\r\n“Thou hast told us of Paradise _gained_, what hast thou to tell us\r\nof Paradise _lost_?” and, granted the existence of the intermediate\r\nrealm of Purgatory, the entire scheme of the _Divina Commedia_ would\r\nbe present to his mind. As poets but rarely “imitate the example of\r\nthose two prudent insects the bee and the spider,” he would begin with\r\nthe _Inferno_, where, notwithstanding the inscription, offensive to an\r\nage as far in advance of its sentiment as Dante himself was in advance\r\nof Homer’s polytheism and anthropomorphism, which he has thought fit\r\nto place upon the portal, Beatrice could have neither part nor lot. It\r\nmust be long indeed before he could rejoin her.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be said, then, that Beatrice is the heroine of his poem,\r\nunless Helen of Troy is the heroine of the _Iliad_. Neither poem could\r\nhave existed without the woman; the action of each turns entirely upon\r\nher; but the appearance of each is infrequent until, in Beatrice’s\r\ncase, she appears as the pervading spirit of the _Paradiso_. Yet, had\r\nwe merely known her from the _Divina Commedia_, their opinion who\r\nregard her as a mere symbol would not have appeared so groundless as it\r\nmust in the light of the transparent autobiography of the _Vita Nuova_.\r\nIf the great epic has given her her world-wide fame, she is indebted\r\nfor her personality to the brief lyrics and snatches of impassioned\r\nprose. The old love, though not extinct, had been transformed into\r\nsomething far more expansive, as alchemists are said to revive a\r\nglowing rose from the ashes of a faded one. When Dante himself essays\r\nto give Can Grande some insight into the purpose of his poem, he does\r\nnot mention Beatrice, but says: “The object of the whole work is to\r\nmake those who live in this life leave their state of misery, and to\r\nlead them to a state of happiness.” By this, as Symonds points out, is\r\nnot to be understood that the purpose of the poem was the admonition of\r\nindividuals. “It was both moral and political. The _status miseriæ_ was\r\nthe discord of divided Christendom as well as of the unregenerate will;\r\nthe _status felicitatis_ was the pacification of the world under the\r\ncoequal sway of Emperor and Pope in Rome, as well as the restoration of\r\nthe human soul to faith.”\r\n\r\nThe conception, therefore, was essentially mediæval. It expressed the\r\nbeliefs and aspirations of the Middle Age. It was in poetry what the\r\nwork of another of the greatest of the Italians, St. Thomas Aquinas,\r\nhad been in theology and philosophy--an endeavour to stereotype the\r\ndominant convictions of the age. And therefore, although not among\r\nthe only genuine epics in the highest sense--those which the nations\r\nhave written for themselves--the _Divina Commedia_ approaches these\r\nmore nearly than any other epic of the second class; for, although the\r\nutterance of a single voice, it says what the average mediæval man\r\nwould have said had he known how. The nearest parallel is Milton’s\r\nepic, which sets forth the view of divine things which had commended\r\nitself to a large portion of the Christian world, but still only to\r\na portion, and therefore a less memorable deliverance than Dante’s.\r\nOne needs only to consider how much lower the Middle Ages would stand\r\nin our estimation if their great interpreter had never written, to\r\nappreciate the enormous importance of Dante’s work for history and\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nDante’s great position, nevertheless, in this point of view, somewhat\r\ndetracts from his originality in other respects. He is the man of\r\nhis age, not a man in advance of his age. He does not, like Goethe,\r\npoint the path of progress along an illimitable future. He has no\r\nprevision of Bacon and Galileo; nor is he fertile in germs, hints, or\r\nprefigurements of greater things to come. His philosophy is that of\r\nAquinas, and his science that of Aristotle. This in no way impairs\r\nhis poetical power, and it still remains the greatest of marvels that\r\nthe transcendent poet and the most representative thinker of the age\r\nshould have met in the same person. Much that appears original in him\r\nis really not peculiar to him, as, for instance, his generous treatment\r\nof the heathen world. There was nothing in this that could surprise\r\nany contemporary. The beatification of the Emperor Trajan was already\r\nan approved legend, and similar promotions in the instances of Ripheus\r\nand Statius only carry the principle somewhat further. His astonishing\r\ntreatment of Ulysses might be regarded as a strong counterpoise, but it\r\nmust be remembered that he was unacquainted with Homer, and probably\r\ntook his view of the character of Ulysses from the _Æneid_. On the\r\nwhole, his attitude towards the classical world is highly to his\r\ncredit; but it merely expresses the dim perception of his age, that\r\ngreater men and greater civilisations had flourished before them, and\r\nthat inspiration from these was wanting to transform the semi-barbarism\r\naround them into a well-ordered society. Hence Dante’s loving devotion\r\nto Virgil, the only portrait in his epic that evinces any considerable\r\npower of character painting; and his tenderness to all things\r\nclassical. Had he flourished along with Petrarch and Boccaccio, Dante\r\nwould have been a great humanist, his scholarship and statesmanship\r\nwould have found wider and more profitable fields of action than his\r\nown age vouchsafed to them; but we should not have had the _Divine\r\nComedy_, towering above every other work of the age much higher even\r\nthan Shakespeare towers above contemporary dramatists; and all his own,\r\neven to its metrical structure, since _terza rima_ appears to have been\r\nDante’s invention.\r\n\r\nThe thought at the foundation of the _Divina Commedia_, nevertheless,\r\nis more ancient than Dante, although the details evince marvellous\r\nfertility of invention. The idea of a descent to the underworld is\r\nthe groundwork of a primitive Assyrian epic in comparison with whose\r\nantiquity the similar narratives in the Buddhistic and other scriptures\r\nare but of yesterday. It is found in Plato’s _Republic_ and the\r\n_Odyssey_, both unknown to Dante, who had, however, the sixth book of\r\nthe _Æneid_ by heart, and implies his obligation by making Virgil his\r\nguide. This is a much more likely source for his poem than the vision\r\nof Tundal and other similar mediæval legends, which are nevertheless\r\nimportant as showing how strong was the hold of the conception upon\r\nthe popular mind. The vast difference between Virgil’s treatment and\r\nDante’s needs no elucidation. Virgil writes like a philosopher, and\r\nDante like a prophet. There is, no doubt, abundance of allegory in\r\nthe _Divina Commedia_, but, generally speaking, the poet’s vision is\r\ndirect and immediate. Symonds puts the essence of the poem into a word\r\nby calling it apocalyptic, and perhaps there is no other great work to\r\nwhich on the whole it presents so close an analogy as the Revelation\r\nof St. John; but neither this nor any forerunner affords any precedent\r\nfor Dante’s astonishing innovation of peopling the unseen worlds mainly\r\nwith his own and his readers’ contemporaries, men whose hands he had\r\nclasped or repelled, with whom he had sat at the council-board or\r\nwhom he had encountered in conflict, or who, personally unknown, had\r\nthrilled him with the report of their fortunes or misfortunes, their\r\ngood deeds or their crimes.\r\n\r\nLet any one try to imagine a modern poet treating the nineteenth\r\ncentury in the same manner, and he will be penetrated by a sense of the\r\ngigantic nature of the attempt, success in which could only be possible\r\nto an intense realist capable of making his phantoms as substantial\r\nas when they walked the earth. Yet this is only one side of Dante’s\r\nmighty task, which was not only to render the unseen world visible and\r\nalmost palpable, but to embody what he fondly believed to be a system\r\nof infallible dogmatic truth. It need hardly be said that it is to\r\nthe consummate execution of the former part of his mission that he is\r\nchiefly indebted for his fame with the world at large. The _Inferno_,\r\nwhere description and portraiture predominate, has impressed the\r\nimagination of mankind far more powerfully than the more mystical and\r\ndoctrinal _Purgatorio_ and _Paradiso_.\r\n\r\nThis is not the judgment of the most refined readers. “The acutest\r\ncritics,” says Shelley, “have justly reversed the judgment of the\r\nvulgar, and the order of the great acts of the _Divina Commedia_ is the\r\nmeasure of the admiration which they accord to Hell, Purgatory, and\r\nParadise.” “The whole _Purgatorio_,” says Symonds, “is a monument to\r\nthe beauty and tranquillity of Dante’s soul. The whole _Paradiso_ is a\r\nproof of its purity and radiance and celestial love.” This is true, and\r\nyet it is indisputable that in thinking of Dante the _Inferno_ always\r\ncomes first to the mind, and that this portion of his poem, had one\r\npart only been published, would have done far more to preserve his name\r\nthan either of the others in the like case, and this although it is\r\nfar more tainted than they are with his most characteristic and least\r\npardonable faults. The chief causes, no doubt, are that the material\r\nsublime is always more impressive to the mass of men than the moral;\r\nthat there is an element of risk and adventure in the poet’s journey\r\namong the shades absent from the other two parts; and that Virgil is\r\na more tangible and human personage than Beatrice. Yet it must also\r\nbe admitted that the diviner beauty of the two latter parts suffers\r\nfrom an admixture of theological and philosophical disquisition, not\r\nthe less tedious because it was impossible for the poet to avoid it.\r\nMilton tells us that the fallen spirits reasoned “of fate, freewill,\r\nfore-knowledge absolute,” but judiciously avoids reporting their\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nDante’s place in comparison with the other chief poets of the world is\r\ndifficult to determine, for none but he has written an apocalypse. He\r\nis emphatically the Seer among them, the “Soothsayer” in the original\r\nsense of the term, the most independent of poetical fiction and\r\nconvention. He is also by far the most individual and autobiographic,\r\nand the only one who is the hero of his own poem. Milton, who is most\r\nnaturally paralleled with him, does not deliver a revelation, but\r\nrecords a history. This at once places Dante in a higher category than\r\nMilton as an elementary force, and when we consider the circumstances\r\nof their respective ages it seems impossible to deny that Dante was\r\nby far the more wonderful man. This does not necessarily establish\r\nthe superiority of the _Divina Commedia_ to _Paradise Lost_. Isaiah\r\npresents himself in a more august and venerable character than Homer,\r\nbut his prophecy is not as majestic as the _Iliad_. It is also\r\ndifficult, when assigning the relative ranks of poets, to discriminate\r\nstrictly between the claims that arise from mere poetical endowment and\r\nthe significance of their position in history. One may stand upon the\r\nhigher pedestal, and the other may have the sweeter voice.\r\n\r\nIn one point of view, Dante’s figure is the most imposing of any\r\npoet’s; for, intensely local as he is, he yet interprets all mediæval\r\nEurope. When, however, he is compared with his closest analogue,\r\nMilton, simply as a poet, it is not so clear that the comparison is to\r\nhis advantage. The great characteristics which chiefly discriminate\r\nhim from all other poets are an ineffable purity, such as we see in\r\nthe early Italian painters, and an intensity of minute description\r\nwhich surpasses the similar performances of others, except England may\r\nsay with pride, Robert Browning’s, as the work of the etching tool\r\nsurpasses the work of the pen. These gifts are best displayed upon a\r\nsmall scale, and hence Dante’s cabinet pieces are more successful than\r\nhis vast pictures. They depend, too, in the last resort upon the poet’s\r\nown fidelity of observation, and hence his best delineations retrace\r\nwhat he has actually seen. His general description of the _Inferno_ is\r\nmore impressive from its unflinching realism than from its imaginative\r\nsublimity. There is no grandeur in his picture of Lucifer, though much\r\nquaint ingenuity, Milton’s “not less than archangel ruined” tells\r\nus more and affects us more profoundly than all Dante’s elaborate\r\nword-painting. If Milton has nothing so beautiful as the exquisite\r\ncomparison of Beatrice to a bird awaiting the dawn that she may gather\r\nfood for her young, neither has Dante anything so sublime as Milton’s\r\ncomparison of the flying fiend to a fleet discerned afar off as hanging\r\nin the clouds, or of Satan equipped for battle to the comet “that fires\r\nthe length of Ophiuchus huge.” The magnificent lines in which Tennyson\r\nhas celebrated the might and music of Milton would seem inappropriate\r\nto Dante. In an age when minute description is in fashion, Dante’s\r\nvirtuoso-like skill in graphic delineation has been favourable to his\r\nrenown; but a reaction must ensue when a bolder and ampler style of\r\nhandling is again appreciated at its worth.\r\n\r\nIf, however, Dante is on the whole inferior to Milton in poetry pure\r\nand simple, he is more important as a representative of a great era\r\nof mankind. In him the Middle Age lives as it does in its cathedrals;\r\nand when the cathedrals have crumbled, the _Divine Comedy_ will be\r\nas fresh as it is now. Nor is this significance merely historical or\r\nantiquarian. From the very first it was appreciated by contemporaries.\r\nRepentant Florence endowed lectures upon the _Divine Comedy_, and\r\nBoccaccio was the first lecturer. In the next century Frezzi tries\r\nto transpose it into another key; and Attavanti cites from the\r\npulpit _Dantes ille noster_ as copiously and reverentially as any of\r\nthe Fathers. Even in the age of the Renaissance, Pius the Fourth’s\r\ncardinals cap quotations from Dante as the last notes of Palestrina’s\r\nMass of Pope Marcellus die down the aisles of St Peter’s. If he\r\nafterwards fell into comparative abeyance for a time, it must be\r\nremembered that Italy lay prostrate in the seventeenth century, and\r\nthat his genius did not sort well with the especial mission assigned to\r\nher in the eighteenth.\r\n\r\nThere can be no surer proof of Dante’s eternal vitality than that\r\nthe revival of his fame coincided with the manifestation of ideas\r\napparently the reverse of his own. The French Revolution brought the\r\nmediæval poet into fashion; and although his best expositors, whom it\r\nis upon the whole most profitable to study, have been those so nearly\r\nat his own intellectual standpoint as Dean Church and Maria Rossetti,\r\nhis most eloquent champions have been those who, on a superficial\r\nview, might seem to have least in common with him--Lamennais, Shelley,\r\nCarlyle, Symonds, Mazzini, Leopardi. The feelings of the man of the\r\nnineteenth century, attracted by the divine and eternal elements in\r\nDante with a vehemence proportioned to his repulsion by the transient\r\nand accidental, are thus powerfully expressed by the greatest of living\r\nItalian poets:\r\n\r\n      _Dante, how is it that my vows I bear,\r\n        Submitted at thy shrine to bend and pray,\r\n        To Night alone relinquishing thy lay,\r\n      And with returning sun returning there?\r\n      Never for me hath Lucy breathed a prayer,\r\n        Matilde with lustral fount washed sin away,\r\n        Or Beatrice on celestial way\r\n      Led up her mortal love by starry stair.\r\n      Thy Holy Empire I abhor, the head\r\n        Of thy great Frederick in Olona’s vale\r\n        Most joyfully had cloven, crown and brains.\r\n      Empire and Church in crumbling ruin fail:\r\n        Above, thy ringing song from heaven is sped:\r\n        The Gods depart, the poet’s hymn remains._\r\n                                              --CARDUCCI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n                      PETRARCH AS MAN OF LETTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough, hardly less than Shakespeare, born not for an age but\r\nfor all time, Dante was nevertheless in an especial sense the poet\r\nof the mediæval period. The vast advance which he effected in the\r\npoetic art had no counterpart in a corresponding progress in the world\r\nof intellect. Powerful as his mind was, it seemed as an organ of\r\nthought rather architectural than creative; more intent on combining\r\nthe materials it found into the most august edifice which their\r\nconstitution admitted, than on gaining new channels for feeling and\r\nintelligence. This was to be the work of a mind far less original than\r\nDante’s, but happily placed at the confluence of mediæval ideas with an\r\nelement by which they were destined to be submerged and transformed.\r\nIn the year 1304, on the very day when Dante and his exiled companions\r\nwere making their desperate attempt to fight their way back into\r\nFlorence, FRANCESCO PETRARCA, the child of one of their number, was\r\nborn a humanist by the grace of God in the Tuscan town of Arezzo. Six\r\nyears after Dante’s death a casual encounter with a lady who awoke\r\nthe faculty of song within him made the scholar the first poet of his\r\nage. But neither the innate love of letters nor the awakened faculty\r\nof poetry would have exalted Petrarch to the literary supremacy he\r\nattained if he had not lived at the very juncture when literature,\r\nhitherto cultivated in some of its branches for mere utility, in\r\nothers as an ornament of courtly life, was beginning to revive as a\r\nprofession. Dante, a statesman, a philosopher, a prophet, was not\r\nin a true sense a man of letters, and neither his ideals nor his\r\ncontemporary influence extended beyond the limits of Italy. Petrarch\r\nwas the first modern literary dictator, the first author to receive the\r\nunanimous homage of a world of culture. Such a world had not existed\r\nsince the decay of antique civilisation, and he may be said to have\r\nbeen in a manner both its cause and its effect. As the Erasmus, the\r\nVoltaire, the Goethe of his age, he claims a more distinguished place\r\nin literary history than even his exquisite poetry, much less his but\r\nrelatively ample erudition, could have secured for him.\r\n\r\nSeven months after Petrarch’s birth his mother was allowed to return to\r\nher patrimonial estate near Florence, where she was sometimes secretly\r\nvisited by her husband. The elder Petrarca (or, as the name was then\r\nspelt, Petracco) might have returned to his native city on the same\r\ndishonourable terms as those offered to Dante, but, like Dante, spurned\r\nthem. Despairing of repatriation, he betook himself to Avignon, then\r\nthe seat of the Papal Court, where he followed the profession of the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nPetrarch was successively educated at Carpentras, at Montpellier, and\r\nat the University of Bologna, where his father’s commands compelled him\r\nto the study of jurisprudence. The death of his parent in 1326 recalled\r\nhim to Avignon, and restored him to letters. To qualify himself for\r\necclesiastical preferment he received the tonsure without taking\r\norders, a step not unusual in those days, and devoted himself entirely\r\nto literature. The “Babylonish captivity” of the Church at Avignon,\r\nviolently as he denounces it in his writings, was highly favourable to\r\nhis interests, for it helped him to the patronage of Cardinal Colonna,\r\nwhose brother, afterwards Bishop of Lombès, he had known intimately at\r\nthe University of Bologna. It was probably from this source that he\r\nderived means to mingle with gay society and indulge in the fashionable\r\nfollies of eccentric costume, which he ridicules in his later writings;\r\nfor letters as yet afforded him no sure subsistence, and his scanty\r\npatrimony had been embezzled or wasted by his guardians. On April 6,\r\n1327[4], occurred the most momentous event of his life, his vision of\r\nLaura in church “at the hour of prime,” which made him a poet. But\r\nfor this, he might never have written in the vernacular. Cicero and\r\nVirgil, his literary idols, enjoined Latin composition, to which in all\r\nprobability he would have exclusively addicted himself but for the need\r\nof celebrating Laura in a language which she understood.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of Laura’s identity will be best considered along with\r\nthe poems devoted to her praise and her adorer’s passion. Neither love\r\nnor society, meanwhile, kept Petrarch from letters, and his reputation\r\nwaxed daily. He displayed a happy faculty for maintaining relations\r\nwith the great, equally honourable to both parties, exempt alike from\r\npresumption and servility. In 1330 he spent a considerable time with\r\nBishop Colonna at his Pyrenean diocese of Lombès, and on his return\r\nwas formally enrolled as a member of the Cardinal’s household. His\r\nresidence at Avignon made him known to the learned English prelate,\r\nRichard de Bury, and other distinguished visitors at the Papal Court,\r\nand he began to enjoy the favour of Robert, King of Naples. His\r\nvernacular poetry, though far inferior to that which he was destined to\r\nproduce, was nevertheless making him and Laura famous, for he exclaims\r\nin an early sonnet:\r\n\r\n      _Blest all songs and music that have spread\r\n      Her laud afar._\r\n\r\nIn 1333 he made a journey to Paris, Belgium, and the Rhine, of which he\r\nhas given us a lively account in his correspondence, and which produced\r\nat least one sonnet which showed that by this time he wanted but little\r\nof perfection:\r\n\r\n      _Through wild inhospitable woods I rove\r\n        Where fear attends even on the soldier’s way,\r\n        Dreadless of ill; for nought can me affray\r\n      Saving that Sun which shines by light of Love:\r\n      And chant, as idly carolling I move,\r\n        Her, whom not Heaven itself can keep away,\r\n        Borne in my eyes; and ladies I survey\r\n      Encircling her, who oaks and beeches prove.\r\n      Her voice in sighing breeze and rustling bough\r\n        And leaf I seem to hear, and birds, and rills\r\n        Murmuring the while they slip through grassy green.\r\n      Rarely have silences and lonely thrills\r\n        Of overshadowing forests pleased as now,\r\n        Except for my own Sun too little seen._\r\n\r\nIn the same year Petrarch graduated as a patriotic poet by composing\r\nhis fine Latin metrical epistle on the woes of Italy. In 1335 he\r\nreceived from the Pope a canonry in the cathedral of his patron the\r\nBishop of Lombès. In 1336 he achieved his celebrated ascent of Mount\r\nVentoux, which marks an era as the inauguration of mountain-climbing\r\nfor pleasure’s sake. In 1336 and 1337 he undertook his first journey\r\nto Rome, which he found in a most lamentable condition from rapine and\r\ncivil war. Attributing this to the absence of the Popes in France, he\r\nbegan his long series of exhortations to them to return, to which,\r\nbeing throughout his lifetime Frenchmen, they naturally turned deaf\r\nears. Hence in a measure the disgust with Avignon which led him\r\nto seclude himself more and more in Vaucluse (_shut valley_), the\r\npicturesque retreat on the Sorga whither he betook himself in 1337, a\r\nbeautiful description of which by Ugo Foscolo may be read in Reeve’s\r\nbiography. His adoration of Laura had not prevented his contracting\r\nless spiritual ties, for two children were born to him about this time.\r\n\r\nPetrarch’s rural leisure was largely employed in the composition\r\nof a Latin history of Rome, which can have had no critical value,\r\nbut would have been deeply interesting as exhibiting the classical\r\nfeeling of the representative of the early Renaissance. He ultimately\r\ndestroyed it, and turned to the composition of his Latin epic on the\r\nPunic war, _Africa_, for and from which he long expected immortality.\r\nHis detestation of the Papal Court breaks out about this time in some\r\npowerful sonnets. His Italian poems, meanwhile, had made their way with\r\nthe world to a degree surprising in an age unacquainted with printing.\r\nIn 1340 he received on the same day the offer of the poetic laurel from\r\nthe cities of Paris and Rome. Deciding for the latter, he embarked at\r\nMarseilles in February 1341, voyaged to Naples, received signal marks\r\nof favour from the King, and, repairing to Rome, was invested with the\r\nlaurel by the Senator of the city, April 8, 1341. From this day the\r\nhistory of modern literature as a recognised power may be said to date.\r\nEre his return at the beginning of 1342, he had finished his _Africa_,\r\nand bought a house at Parma to give himself a footing in his native\r\nland.\r\n\r\nIn 1343 Petrarch was again in Italy, discharging an important\r\ndiplomatic mission with which he had been entrusted by the new Pope\r\nClement VI. to the Court of Naples; the state of which he describes in\r\ndark colours, not too dark, as the history of the hapless Queen Joanna,\r\nRobert’s successor, sufficiently proves. He nevertheless rendered\r\nhimself acceptable to her, and, his mission honourably discharged,\r\nrepaired to Parma, where (1344) he wrote the first of his great\r\npolitical odes, _Italia mia benche il parlar sia indarno_, and whence\r\nhe was chased by civil discord. He did not, however, return to Avignon\r\nuntil towards the end of this year. The next few years were chiefly\r\nspent in literary occupations, the most remarkable of which was the\r\ncomposition (1347) of his ode to the Tribune Cola di Rienzi, in whom\r\nhe saw the deliverer of his country. Petrarch’s course was not free\r\nfrom the imputation of ingratitude to his old friends and patrons,\r\nthe Colonna family; yet it would have been worse to have been silent\r\nat the prospect, however brief and delusive, of the resurrection of\r\nRome. Other poets before him had written on Italian politics, but none,\r\nnot even Dante, had so exalted their theme by eloquence and ennobling\r\nlargeness of view:\r\n\r\n        _Her ancient-walls, which still with fear and love\r\n        The world admires, whene’er it calls to mind\r\n        The days of Eld, and turns to look behind;\r\n        Her hoar and caverned monuments above\r\n        The dust of men whose fame, until the world\r\n        In dissolution sink, can never fail;\r\n        Her all, that in one ruin now lies hurled,\r\n        Hopes to have healed by thee its every ail.\r\n        O faithful Brutus! noble Scipios dead!\r\n        To you what triumph, where ye now are blest,\r\n        If of our worthy choice the fame have spread!\r\n        And how his laurelled crest\r\n        Will old Fabricius rear, with joy elate\r\n      That his own Rome again shall beauteous be and great!_\r\n                                                      --MACGREGOR.\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1348, was one of havoc and desolation for Europe,\r\nthrough the ravages of the Black Death, which swept away a larger\r\nproportion of her inhabitants than any similar visitation recorded in\r\nhistory. Laura was among the victims, dying on April 6, the anniversary\r\nof her meeting with Petrarch. Cardinal Colonna, his chief patron since\r\nthe death of the Bishop of Lombès, was also carried off on July 3.\r\nNothing can be added to his own words:\r\n\r\n      _The lofty Column and the Laurel green,\r\n        Whose shade was shelter for my weary thought,\r\n        Are broken; mine no longer that which sought\r\n      North, south and east and west shall not be seen.\r\n      Ravished by Death the treasures twain have been\r\n        Whereby I wended with glad courage fraught,\r\n        By land or lordship ne’er to be rebought,\r\n      Or golden heap or gem of Orient sheen.\r\n      If this the high arbitrament of Fate,\r\n        What else remains for me than visage bent,\r\n        And eye embathed and spirit desolate?\r\n      O life of man, in prospect excellent!\r\n        What scarce stow striving years accumulate\r\n        So lightly in a morning to be spent!_\r\n\r\nPetrarch’s demeanour after the death of his Laura presents a strong\r\ncontrast to Dante’s after the like bereavement, nor does he suffer by\r\nthe comparison. Nothing can surpass the poignancy of Dante’s first\r\ngrief as depicted in the _Vita Nuova_; but he soon forms another\r\ntie, and though the memory of Beatrice is ever with him, the human\r\naffection sublimates more and more into an abstract spiritual type.\r\nPetrarch’s utterances, on the other hand, wear at first something\r\nof a conventional semblance, but constantly increase in depth and\r\ntenderness, and while he remains the humanist in his studies and\r\nthe diplomatist in active life, his poetry, as of old, is all but\r\nmonopolised by his one passion. As his attachment to Laura in her life\r\nhad been compatible with frequent and long absences, so her death did\r\nnot prevent him from discharging the public functions fitly entrusted\r\nto the most eminent scholar of his age.\r\n\r\nAlthough he often expresses in his verse his delight in revisiting\r\nthe banks of the Sorga, his life from this time was chiefly spent in\r\nUpper Italy, much occupied by the discharge of diplomatic commissions\r\nfrom the Pope, the Venetian Republic, and the Lords of Milan and Padua;\r\nconstantly appealing to the Avignon Popes to terminate the “Babylonish\r\ncaptivity” of the Church; vexed by the undutifulness of his natural\r\nson, but finding comfort in his daughter; indefatigable in collecting\r\nand transcribing manuscripts; giving, though himself ignorant of\r\nGreek, a powerful impulse to Hellenic studies by commissioning a\r\nLatin translation of Homer; producing many of his most pleasing minor\r\nLatin writings; and throwing his last energies into the apotheosis of\r\nLaura in his _Trionfi_. He went to Paris to congratulate John, King\r\nof France, on his release from captivity in England; and was present\r\nat the marriage of Lionel, Duke of Clarence, at Milan, where or soon\r\nafterwards he may possibly have encountered Chaucer. Boccaccio followed\r\nhim with respectful homage, and almost his last literary labour was\r\nthe Latin translation of the Florentine’s tale of _Patient Griselda_.\r\nThe last four years of his life, though with many intervals of public\r\nbusiness, were chiefly spent in his retirement at Arquá, a village in\r\nthe Euganean Hills, where death overtook him as he bent over a book,\r\nJuly 20, 1374. He had virtually finished the _Trionfi_ about three\r\nmonths previously.\r\n\r\nWe have devoted more space to the biography of Petrarch than to that\r\nof Dante, because, although Dante towers above him as a poet, Petrarch\r\nis the more important figure in Italian literary history. Dante\r\nstands alone: venerated as he was by his countrymen, and not wholly\r\ndestitute of imitators, he yet founded no school, and his influence\r\non the development of the Italian intellect is slight in comparison\r\nwith Petrarch’s. Together with the great schoolman who quitted the\r\nworld as he entered it, he sums up the Middle Age, which in him and\r\nAquinas attains its highest development. Petrarch, on the other hand,\r\nis the representative Italian. He does not, like Dante, deliver, but\r\nis himself a prophecy: the future of Italian culture is prefigured in\r\nhim. He was also the first to bestow on Italy an unquestioned supremacy\r\nin the world of literature, and was the earliest restorer of the\r\nrepublic of letters, a conception extinct in the ages of barbarism.\r\nIn this restoration, transcending the limits of his own country, his\r\nLatin writings were necessarily more influential than his Italian[5],\r\nand although they do not properly belong to our subject, their great\r\nimportance in the history of culture entitles them to a few words.\r\n\r\nThe chief causes of Petrarch’s failure as a Latin poet are evident. In\r\nthe infancy of vernacular literature it was not sufficiently understood\r\nthat compositions in a dead language, however exquisite, must fail\r\nto bestow immortality. Nor could Petrarch himself be fully aware\r\nhow impossible it was to write like a Roman poet in the new dawn of\r\nreviving classical studies. It took two centuries of culture to produce\r\na Vida and a Sannazaro, and if their names are undying, the same can\r\nhardly be said of their Latin works. But there was a deeper reason.\r\nPetrarch attempted epic composition without epic inspiration. His\r\ngenius was entirely lyric, and his poetry has little value except where\r\nit palpitates with lyrical feeling. When he writes on the misfortunes\r\nof his country, he is a poet even when writing in Latin; and his great\r\nLatin epic, the _Africa_, too often tame, notwithstanding its true\r\nnatural feeling, sometimes, especially when near the end of the poem\r\nhe speaks of himself, kindles into poetry. The Latin verses placed by\r\nColeridge on the half-title of his own love-poems in _Sibylline Leaves_\r\nare almost as exquisite as the tenderest passages of the _Canzoniere_\r\nitself[6]:\r\n\r\n\r\n      _Quas humilis tenero stylus olim effudit in ævo,\r\n      Perlegis hic lacrymas, et quod pharetratus acuta\r\n      Ille puer puero fecit mihi cuspide vulnus.\r\n      Omnia paulatim consumit longior ætas,\r\n      Vivendoque simul morimur, rapimurque manendo.\r\n      Ipse mihi collatus enim non ille videbor:\r\n      Frons alia est, moresque alii, nova mentis imago,\r\n      Voxque aliud sonat.\r\n      Pectore nunc gelido calidos miseremur amantes,\r\n      Jamque arsisse pudet. Veteres tranquilla tumultus\r\n      Mens horret, relegensque alium putat ista locutum._\r\n\r\nAlthough Petrarch preferred Latin to Italian in the abstract, and\r\neven affected to undervalue Dante because his chief works were\r\ncomposed in the vulgar tongue, he acknowledged that he had missed\r\nthe perfection in Latin which he was conscious of having attained in\r\nItalian. His only prose-writings with any significance for us now are\r\nthe autobiographic. Some of his ethical disquisitions, however, if they\r\nhad come down from classic times, would have been regarded as precious\r\nmonuments of antiquity. The most important of these is the _De Remediis\r\nutriusque Fortunæ_ (1356), in two books, the first treating of the\r\nsnares of prosperity, the second arming the soul against adversity.\r\nThe reflections are forcibly expressed, but in themselves somewhat\r\ntrite. His tract _De sua et aliorum Ignorantia_ (1361), on the other\r\nhand, abounds with energy, and gives a lively picture of the strife in\r\nhis bosom between the humanistic scholar and the orthodox Christian.\r\nMore vital still, at least after some pedantic digressions have been\r\ndiscarded, is his _Secretum, sive de Contemptu Mundi_ (1342), where\r\nthe conflict in his mind between the sense of moral obligation and\r\nhis passion for Laura is so depicted as to render him the prototype\r\nof Rousseau, and entitle us to derive one of the most characteristic\r\ndepartments of modern literature from him. He is no less the father\r\nof modern autobiography by the slight but charming sketch he has left\r\nof himself in his _Epistola ad Posteros_, prefixed to the general\r\ncollection of his letters. It was a great discovery that the external\r\ncircumstances of a remarkable life are not the only ones worth relating.\r\n\r\nThe most important of all Petrarch’s Latin works is his collection\r\nof Epistles, partly formed by himself in his lifetime, and greatly\r\nenriched by the diligence of recent editors, especially Fracassetti.\r\nThese are not only of high interest from the portrait they convey of\r\nthe man himself, equally as an individual and as the ideal type of the\r\nman of letters, but form a perpetual commentary on the manners and\r\ncustoms of his age. Many, though composed by Petrarch, are written in\r\nthe names of sovereigns or public bodies; others are letters of warm\r\nencouragement or warmer remonstrance to popes, emperors, and others who\r\nthen seemed, but only seemed, to have the world’s destinies in their\r\nhands. In all his correspondence with the great, Petrarch, like Dante,\r\nappears as the idealist, inspired by the remembrance of antiquity, and\r\nurging upon the rulers of the day a more exalted course of action than\r\nsuited their dispositions, or, it must be admitted, was compatible\r\nwith the circumstances of the time. They on their parts seem to have\r\nappreciated the honour of being lectured by such a man, and to have\r\npermitted him to say what he pleased, satisfied that he could exert\r\nno practical influence upon the course of politics. Printing and the\r\nliberty of the press have now made the humblest newspaper scribe more\r\npotent than the first man of letters of the fourteenth century. Some\r\nof Petrarch’s epistles are of unique interest, such as the description\r\nof his ascent of Mount Ventoux, of the great tempest at Naples, and\r\nof the apparition of the ghost of the Bishop of Lombès, the first\r\ncircumstantial narrative of the kind, and perhaps to this day the best\r\nauthenticated.\r\n\r\nPetrarch’s encouragement of classical study is not the least among\r\nhis titles to fame. He was the Erasmus of his age in so far as the\r\nrudimentary condition of criticism allowed, and, in so far as his means\r\npermitted, its Mæcenas. He discovered Cicero’s epistles to Atticus,\r\nand, by his own statement, which there seems no sufficient reason\r\nfor rejecting, had at one time the lost treatise _De Gloria_ in his\r\nhands. He yearned towards Homer and Plato, whom he could not read in\r\nthe original, but perused in translations. The fullest information\r\nrespecting his literary tastes, the extent of his library and his\r\nknowledge of the classics, his borrowings and loans of manuscripts, his\r\ncopyists and his bindings, will be found in the excellent monograph\r\nof Pierre de Nolhac, _Pétrarque et l’Humanisme_ (Paris, 1892). Many\r\nmanuscripts known to have belonged to him still exist, chiefly in\r\nFrench public libraries. The story of the destruction of his books by\r\nthe neglect of the Venetians is groundless; they ought to have been\r\nmade over to the Republic after his death, but they never reached\r\nVenice. The Aldine Italic type is said to have been modelled after\r\nPetrarch’s handwriting, and the first book in which it was used was an\r\nedition of the author whom he principally annotated, Virgil.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] Petrarch says on a Good Friday, but Good Friday did not fall on\r\nApril 6 in 1327, and the statement of the encounter having taken place\r\nin church at all is inconsistent with other passages in his writings.\r\n\r\n[5] “It is pleasing,” says Coleridge, in a note to his little-known\r\n_Maximian_, “to contemplate in this illustrious man at once the\r\nbenefactor of his own times and the delight of the succeeding, and\r\nworking on his contemporaries by that portion of his works which is\r\nleast in account with posterity.”\r\n\r\n[6] From the epistle to Barbatus, Coleridge says of the entire\r\ncomposition: “Had Petrarch lived a century later, and, retaining all\r\nhis _substantiality_ of head and heart, added to it the elegancies and\r\nmanly politure of Fracastorius, Flaminius, Vida, and their co-rivals,\r\nthis letter would have been a classical gem” (_Anima Poetæ_, p. 263).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n                          PETRARCH AND LAURA\r\n\r\n\r\nPetrarch’s activity as a scholar claimed so much larger a portion\r\nof his time and thoughts than his _Canzoniere_, and the bulk of the\r\nlatter, considerable as it is, is so small in comparison with that\r\nof the mass of his writings, that Symonds seems almost justified in\r\ndepreciating his work as an Italian lyrist in comparison with his\r\ninfluence as a humanist. Yet Petrarch’s Latin works were like the\r\nfalling rain, which passes away as a distinct existence, though long\r\ninvisibly operative as a fertilising agent; while his poetry, confined\r\nto a definite channel by the restraints of consummate diction and\r\nstyle, flows in a crystal stream for ever. Here and there in other\r\nmen’s books, no doubt, an isolated love-strain of higher quality may\r\nbe found, but nothing approaching the _Canzoniere_ as an epitomised\r\nencyclopædia of passion. The best is transcendently excellent; and if\r\nmany of the pieces, especially near the beginning, might well have been\r\ndispensed with as far as their individual desert is concerned, they\r\nstill have their value as notes in a great harmony. As his translator\r\nCayley well remarks, “No poet has so fully represented the whole\r\nworld of love in every tone and variety of play and earnest, delight\r\nand pain, enthusiasm and self-reproach, expostulation, rebellion,\r\nsubmission, adoration, and friendship, or regret and religious\r\nconsolations leading gradually to another sphere of hope and devotion.”\r\nOne thing only is wanting to this encyclopædia of emotion, the rapture\r\nof possession. This was not for Petrarch: throughout the first part he\r\nis the yearning suitor, throughout the second the dejected mourner.\r\nHardly another man ever sighed or wept with so much constancy or so\r\nlittle recompense.\r\n\r\nWho was the object of this unique passion and perpetual grief? So\r\nobscure are the circumstances that some have deemed Laura, like the\r\ncandlemaker’s widow at Père la Chaise, “une métaphore, un symbole.”\r\nPetrarch’s friend, the Bishop of Lombès, suspected as much, but\r\nPetrarch indignantly protested, and after a while refuted the surmise\r\nby a manuscript note in his Virgil, to be treated more fully hereafter.\r\nApart from this, it seems strange that scepticism should have survived\r\nhis avowal, on a serious occasion, the composition of his address to\r\nposterity; where he speaks of his affection for Laura as his sole\r\nincitement to worthy fame, and of her own reputation as something\r\nentirely independent of his praises. “What little I am, such as it\r\nis, I am through her; and if I have attained to any fame or glory, I\r\nhad never possessed it if the few grains of virtue which Nature had\r\ndeposited in my soul had not been cultivated by her with such noble\r\naffection. What else did I desire in my youth than to please her,\r\nand her alone, who alone had pleased me?” The strongest testimony,\r\nhowever, is that of the poems themselves, which are full of traits and\r\ndescriptions evidently derived from real life, and which would lose all\r\ntheir charm if they could be deemed imaginary. Take this for example:\r\n\r\n      _As Love pursued me in the wonted glade,\r\n        Wary as he, who weening foe to find,\r\n        Guards every pass, and looks before, behind,\r\n      I stood in mail of ancient thought arrayed:\r\n      When, sideways turned, I saw by sudden shade\r\n        The sun impeded, and, on earth outlined\r\n        Her shape, who, if aright conceives my mind,\r\n      Meetest for immortality was made.\r\n      I said unto my heart, 'Why dost thou fear?’\r\n        But ere my heart could open to my thought,\r\n        The beams whereby I melt shone all around;\r\n      And, as when flash by thunder-peal is caught,\r\n        My eyes encounter of those eyes most dear\r\n        And smiling welcome simultaneous found._\r\n\r\nHow natural and pleasing if the incident be real! and how marvellous\r\nthe poetical power which can raise such an edifice out of such a\r\ntrifle! On the other hand, how insipid if the little event, instead of\r\na ripple on the surface of life arrested by the poet’s art ere it has\r\nhad time to pass into nothingness, be but a fiction to enable him to\r\nsay a pretty thing! The author of so frigid a contrivance could never\r\nhave been the author of the _Canzoniere_.\r\n\r\nBut though Laura’s actual existence is certain, her identity is\r\na subject of everlasting controversy. The popular belief near to\r\nPetrarch’s own day is expressed by an anonymous biographer, who,\r\nwriting, as is thought, near the end of the fourteenth century,\r\ncalls her Loretta, and, by adding that the Pope offered Petrarch a\r\ndispensation from his ecclesiastical vows in order to marry her,\r\nclearly indicates that she was believed to be a single woman. The Abbé\r\nde Sade, however, in his life of Petrarch, published in 1767, adduces\r\nmuch documentary and other evidence to identify her with Laura, born De\r\nNoves, wife of Hugo de Sade, and an ancestress of the Abbé’s own. With\r\none important exception, to be mentioned shortly, the Abbé’s proofs are\r\nof little weight; they establish the existence of a Laura de Sade, but\r\nby no means that she was Petrarch’s Laura. An account of the discovery\r\nof Laura de Sade’s tomb in 1533, authenticated by some very bad verses\r\nattributed to Petrarch found within it, although itself genuine,\r\nevidently records a clumsy fabrication.\r\n\r\nOne advantage the Abbé’s theory certainly has, the production of an\r\nunanswerable reason why Petrarch did not marry Laura; but, on the other\r\nhand, his ecclesiastical orders might be a sufficient impediment.\r\nThe Papal dispensation which might have relieved him of them must\r\nsurely have relieved him of his preferments also; and if the story is\r\nauthentic, the offer came in all probability from Clement VI., the\r\nPope by whom he was chiefly favoured, who did not attain the tiara\r\nuntil 1342, fifteen years after his first acquaintance with Laura,\r\nwhen Laura’s health seems to have been much impaired, and he may well\r\nhave thought the time gone by. The objections to his suit having been\r\naddressed to a married woman seem almost insurmountable. If his flame\r\nwas Laura de Sade, she was the mother of a very numerous family, and\r\nit appears all but incredible that he should have inscribed so much\r\nverse to her both in her lifetime and after her death, and discussed\r\nhis passion so freely in his Dialogae without the slightest allusion\r\nto husband or children; or that the identity of a lady holding so high\r\na position, and celebrated in verses read all over Italy, should so\r\nlong have remained obscure; or that he should have enjoyed such freedom\r\nof access to her as he evidently did. The idea, moreover, seems quite\r\ninconsistent with the tenor of the celebrated sonnet, _Tranquillo porto\r\navea mostrato Amore_:\r\n\r\n      _Love had at length a tranquil port displayed\r\n        To travailed soul, long vexed by toil and teen,\r\n        In calm maturity, where naked seen\r\n      Is Vice, and Virtue in fair garb arrayed.\r\n      Bare to her eyes my heart should now be laid,\r\n        Disquieted no more their peace serene--\r\n        O Death! what harvest of long years hath been\r\n      Ruin by thee in one brief moment made!\r\n      The hour when unreproved I might invoke\r\n        Her chaste ear’s favour, and disburden there\r\n        My breast of fond and ancient thought, drew nigh:\r\n      And she, perchance, considering as I spoke\r\n        Each bloomless face and either’s silvered hair,\r\n        Some blessed word had uttered with a sigh._\r\n\r\nThe thought manifestly is, that if Laura had lived a short time longer\r\ntheir intimacy would have given no occasion for scandal. This might\r\nbe true of an unmarried lady or a widow, hardly of a wife. The sonnet\r\nalso proves that Petrarch and Laura were nearly of an age, refuting\r\nVellutello’s opinion on this point. Salvatore Betti, moreover, has\r\nfound another Laura, fulfilling, in his estimation, all requisites as\r\nwell as the Abbé de Sade’s.\r\n\r\nIt must, notwithstanding, be acknowledged that there is one piece\r\nof documentary evidence almost sufficient to prove the Abbé’s theory\r\nin the teeth of all objections, could we but be certain of its\r\ngenuineness. This is the will of Laura de Sade, made in a condition of\r\nextreme sickness on April 3, 1348. We know on Petrarch’s own authority\r\nthat his Laura died on April 6, for the genuineness of the note in his\r\nVirgil where he records this fact is now regarded as incontestable.\r\nThat two ladies of the name of Laura were dying at or near Avignon at\r\nthe same time is clearly improbable. But is the will itself authentic?\r\nor may it not have been altered or interpolated? The Abbé cites it as a\r\ndocument in his family archives; its existence is attested by several\r\npersons in the eighteenth century; but it does not appear to have been\r\nsubmitted to the scrutiny of any expert, nor can we learn whether such\r\nan examination has ever been made since, or whether the testament is\r\nnow producible[7]. Should its authenticity ever be demonstrated, but\r\nhardly otherwise, we shall be almost compelled to embrace a belief\r\nliable in every other point of view to formidable objections.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Laura, as depicted by Petrarch, is the most ethereal feminine\r\nideal ever conceived, his passion was certainly not of the Platonic\r\nkind. The contrary has been asserted, but is contradicted by every\r\npage of the _Canzoniere_, which is full of reproaches to Laura for her\r\ncruelty, incomprehensible if she was not withholding very substantial\r\nfavours. He certainly did not want for encouragements of a more\r\nspiritual nature:\r\n\r\n      _The mist of pallor in such beauteous wise\r\n        The sweetness of her smile did overscreen,\r\n        That my thrilled heart, upon my visage seen,\r\n      Sprang to encounter it in swift surprise.\r\n      How soul by soul is scanned in Paradise\r\n        Then knew I, unto whom disclosed had been\r\n        That thought pathetic by all gaze unseen\r\n      Save mine, who solely for such sight have eyes.\r\n      All look angelical, all tender gest\r\n        That e’er on man by grace of woman beamed\r\n        At side of this had shown discourtesy.\r\n      The gentle visage, modestly depressed\r\n        Earthward, inquired with silence, as meseemed,\r\n        'Who draws my faithful friend away from me?'_\r\n\r\nLong after this, which surely should have satisfied a Platonic lover,\r\nhe is looking forward to a more perfect consummation of his wishes:\r\n\r\n      _Love sends me messengers of gentle thought,\r\n        Since days of yore our trusty go-between,\r\n        And comforts me, who ne’er, he saith, have been\r\n      So near as now to hopes fruition brought._\r\n\r\nWhat hope’s fruition was we learn from numerous sonnets composed after\r\nthe death of Laura, in which the poet expresses his thankfulness that\r\nhis mistress did not yield to his too ardent entreaties, but kept him\r\nin order by her frowns, a function attributed to her even in the first\r\nbook of sonnets:\r\n\r\n      _O happy arts of excellent effect!\r\n        I labouring with the tongue, she with the glance,\r\n        Have glory there, and virtue here bestowed._\r\n\r\nLaura’s attitude towards Petrarch seems not ill expressed in the sonnet\r\ncomposed in the eighteenth century by Ippolito Pindemonte:\r\n\r\n      _To thee, immortal lady lowly laid\r\n        Where Sorga glassed thy loveliness divine.\r\n        I bow in worship; not because was thine\r\n      The beauty solely for the coffin made;\r\n      But for the soul that animating swayed,\r\n        And, cold and colder growing, did incline\r\n        Brighter and brighter yet to soar and shine\r\n      Thy lover’s flame of passion unallayed.\r\n      For certes his lament had seemed misplaced,\r\n        And much the pathos of his music marred,\r\n        Had not his lady been so very chaste:\r\n      Come, grateful Italy, with fond regard,\r\n        To kiss the tomb by such a tenant graced,\r\n        And bless the dust that gave thee such a bard._\r\n\r\nThis peculiar relation of Laura to Petrarch as a monitress, no less\r\nthan an object of adoration, goes far to establish the reality of his\r\npassion, which is exactly that which men frequently entertain for women\r\na little older than themselves, and whom they deem in some measure or\r\nsome respect their superiors. He feels himself ennobled by his love, a\r\nsentiment expressed with great force in the tenth sonnet, one of the\r\nearliest, and in many others, especially the beautiful Sonnet clii.:\r\n\r\n      _Soul, that such various things with various art\r\n        Dost hearken, read, discourse, conceive and write;\r\n        Fond eyes, and thou, keen sense framed exquisite\r\n      To bear her holy message to the heart:\r\n      Rejoice ye that it hath not been your part\r\n        To gain the road so hard to keep aright\r\n        Too late or soon for beacon of her light,\r\n      Or guidance her imprinted steps impart.\r\n      Now with such beam and such direction blest\r\n        ’Twere shameful in brief way to miss the sign\r\n       Pointing the passage to eternal rest.\r\n      Upward, faint soul, thy heavenward path incline;\r\n        Through clouds of her sweet wrath pursue thy quest,\r\n        Following the seemly step and ray divine._\r\n\r\nWe do not know whether Petrarch had written any poetry before he\r\ntuned his lyre to hymn Laura. His beginnings (the exquisite initial\r\nsonnet being in fact the last written of any) are at first feeble and\r\nuncertain. It is not until arriving at Sonnet xxii. that he strikes a\r\nnote worthy of his mature power, and he continues unequal up to about\r\nSonnet lx., when masterpieces begin to occur with frequency; from this\r\npoint onwards the proportion of absolutely insignificant poems is\r\ncomparatively small. The interspersed sestines and ballate add little\r\nto his reputation; not so the canzoni, which are among his noblest\r\nproductions. Traces of a chronological arrangement are evident; thus\r\nhis secession to the Sorga gives birth to a group of sonnets with which\r\nthose denouncing the Papal Court at Avignon are intimately connected;\r\nand in general the poems show a continuous development of style, but\r\nthere are some signal exceptions. Towards the end of the first book\r\nhis Muse would seem in danger of flagging, were she not stimulated\r\nby forebodings of the death of Laura. The pieces expressing this\r\napprehension form a well-marked group, which may be associated with the\r\ndoubts and fears which, after Laura’s decease, he tells us beset him on\r\nhis last parting with her (1347):\r\n\r\n      _The lovely eyes, now in supernal sphere\r\n        Bright with the light whence life and safety rain,\r\n      Leaving mine mendicant and mourning here,\r\n        Flashed with new mood they seemed to entertain,\r\n      Saying to these: Take comfort, friends most dear,\r\n        Not here but elsewhere shall we meet again._\r\n\r\nMestica, the most critical of Petrarch’s editors, seems to think that\r\nhe wrote no more on Laura in her lifetime after the great spiritual\r\nchange which he supposes him to have undergone in 1343, when he wrote\r\nhis dialogue with St. Augustine. We see but slight evidence of any such\r\nmetamorphosis.\r\n\r\nThe second book of the _Canzoniere_, comprising the pieces composed\r\nafter the death of Laura, resembles the first in their comparative\r\ninferiority at the beginning, after a fine introductory sonnet. Either\r\nPetrarch’s grief had paralysed his powers, or he had not fully realised\r\nhis loss, or he had not yet hit upon the fitting tone. In a short time,\r\nhowever, he regains his true self, and the second part is generally\r\ndeemed to excel the first, as pathos excels passion. It is not that the\r\nartist is more consummate, but the capabilities of his instrument are\r\ngreater. The poems generally fall into two groups--laments for Laura’s\r\nloss, or consolation derived from the realisation of her presence on\r\nearth or in heaven. An example of each must be given:\r\n\r\n      _The eyes whose praise I penned with glowing thought,\r\n        And countenance and limbs and all fair worth\r\n        That sundered me from men of mortal birth,\r\n      From them dissevered, in myself distraught;\r\n      The clustering locks with golden glory fraught;\r\n        The sudden-shining smile, as angels’ mirth,\r\n        Wonted to make a paradise on earth;\r\n      Are now a little dust, that feels not aught.\r\n      Still have I life, who rail and rage at it,\r\n        Lorn of Love’s light that solely life endears;\r\n        Mastless before the hurricane I flit.\r\n      Be this my last of lays to mortal ears;\r\n        Dried is the ancient fountain of my wit,\r\n        And all my music melted into tears._\r\n\r\n      _Exalted by my thought to regions where\r\n        I found whom earthly quest hath never shown,\r\n        Where Love hath rule ’twixt fourth and second zone;\r\n      More beautiful I found her, less austere.\r\n      Clasping my hand, she said, 'Behold the sphere\r\n        Where we shall dwell, if Wish hath truly known.\r\n        I am, who wrung from thee such bitter moan;\r\n      Whose sun went down ere evening did appear.\r\n      My bliss, too high for man to understand,\r\n        Yet needs thee, and the veil that so did please.\r\n        Now unto dust for briefest season given.’\r\n      Why ceased she speaking? why withdrew her hand?\r\n        For, rapt to ecstasy by words like these,\r\n        Little I wanted to have stayed in Heaven._\r\n\r\nThis latter mood is in general the more characteristic of Petrarch.\r\nTowards the end it prevails more and more, but the same falling-off\r\nis observable as in the former book. Petrarch’s religious sonnets are\r\nexquisite when they involve a direct vision of Laura, but otherwise\r\nthey are apt to become tame and conventional. It is almost a pity that\r\nthe most notable exception should ever have been written, though it\r\nranks among his masterpieces:\r\n\r\n      _Ever do I lament the days gone by,\r\n        When adoration of a mortal thing\r\n        Bound me to earth, though gifted with a wing\r\n      That haply had upraised me to the sky.\r\n      Thou, unto whom unveiled my errors lie,\r\n        Celestial, unbeheld, eternal King,\r\n        Help to the frail and straying spirit bring,\r\n      And lack of grace with grace of Thine supply.\r\n      So shall the life in storm and warfare spent\r\n        In peaceful haven close; if here in vain\r\n        Her tarrying, seemly her departure be.\r\n      Aid me to live the little life yet lent;\r\n        Expiring strength with Thy strong arm sustain:\r\n        Thou knowest I have hope in none but Thee._\r\n\r\nWere this more than a passing mood, it would be painful indeed that\r\nPetrarch should have lived to deem his devotion to Laura misspent,\r\nand nothing short of ludicrous that he should have accused himself\r\nof missing by his _Canzoniere_ the renown which epics or tragedies\r\nmight have ensured him. Such a passing mood it must have been, for it\r\nis contradicted by the succeeding pieces. The book concludes with an\r\nimpassioned hymn to the Virgin, which may have suggested to Goethe the\r\nanalogous conclusion of _Faust_.\r\n\r\nThe _Canzoniere_ is completed by the _Trionfi_, allegorical shows\r\nentirely in the taste of the Middle Ages, which we shall find repeated\r\nin Francesco Colonna’s _Polifilo_. Petrarch successively sings the\r\nmight of Love, Chastity, Death, Fame, Time, and Eternity, set forth\r\nin the long processions of their captives or votaries. A certain\r\ncircumscription is essential to the full display of Petrarch’s genius,\r\nand _terza rima_, a metre favourable to diffuseness, does not exhibit\r\nhis powers to such advantage as the severe restriction of his sonnets\r\nand canzoni. The poem, nevertheless, if a little garrulous, charms\r\nby deep feeling and a succession of delightful if not transcendent\r\nbeauties. The finest portion is the Triumph of Death, when Laura\r\nappears, and addresses the poet to much the same effect as in his\r\nsonnets written after her decease. “L’on est vraiment touché de voir\r\nque dans un âge avancé Pétrarque ne se consolait encore de l’avoir\r\nperdue qu’en se rappelant et se retraçant dans ses vers tout ce qui\r\nlui faisait croire que Laura en effet l’avait aimé” (Ginguené). It was\r\nbegun in 1357, and is not entirely complete, though Petrarch continued\r\nto add and retouch until within a very short time of his death. The\r\nlast lines relate to Laura, who, present or absent, is always the\r\ninspiration of the poem. Petrarch evidently wrote greatly under the\r\ninfluence of his reminiscences of Dante, and this may account for his\r\nunwillingness, frequently attributed to unworthy jealousy, to concern\r\nhimself with his predecessor in his latter years. He knew that Dante’s\r\nspirit was more potent than his, and feared to be subjugated by it, as\r\nhas happened to many. He has himself been imitated by Shelley in the\r\n_Triumph of Life_.\r\n\r\nThe odes with which the _Canzoniere_ is interspersed are no less\r\nbeautiful than the sonnets, but are less adapted for quotation, since\r\nit is impossible to give any one in its entirety, and they must greatly\r\nsuffer by abridgement. There is, however, a certain completeness in the\r\nfirst three stanzas of _Chiare, fresche, e dolci acque_, excellently\r\ntranslated by Leigh Hunt:\r\n\r\n      _Clear, fresh, and dulcet streams,\r\n      Which the fair shape who seems\r\n      To me sole woman, haunted at noon-tide;\r\n      Fair bough, so gently fit\r\n      (I sigh to think of it),\r\n      Which lent a pillow to her lovely side;\r\n      And turf, and flowers bright-eyed,\r\n      O’er which her folded gown\r\n      Flowed like an angel’s down;\r\n      And you, oh holy air and hushed,\r\n      Where first my heart at her sweet glances gushed;\r\n      Give ear, give ear with one consenting,\r\n      To my last words, my last, and my lamenting._\r\n\r\n      _If’tis my fate below,\r\n      And Heaven will have it so,\r\n      That love must close these dying eyes in tears,\r\n      May my poor dust be laid\r\n      In middle of your shade,\r\n      While my soul naked mounts to its own spheres.\r\n      The thought would calm my fears,\r\n      When taking, out of breath,\r\n      The doubtful step of death;\r\n      For never could my spirit find\r\n      A stiller port after the stormy wind,\r\n      Nor in more calm, abstracted bourne\r\n      Slip from my travailed flesh, and from my bones outworn\r\n      Perhaps, some future hour,\r\n      To her accustomed bower\r\n      Might come the untamed, and yet the gentle she;\r\n      And where she saw me first,\r\n      Might turn with eyes athirst\r\n      And kinder joy to look again for me;\r\n      Then, oh, the charity!\r\n      Seeing amid the stones\r\n      The earth that held my bones,\r\n      A sigh for very love at last\r\n      Might ask of Heaven to pardon me the past;\r\n      And Heaven itself could not say nay,\r\n      As with her gentle veil she wiped the tears away._\r\n\r\nNot much need be said of Petrarch’s character, whether as poet,\r\nscholar, or man. As a poet he deserves to be numbered among the few\r\nwho have attained absolute perfection within a certain sphere; to whom\r\nwithin these limits nothing can be added, though much may be taken\r\naway. The subtraction of the trivial or fantastic from Petrarch’s verse\r\nleaves, nevertheless, a mass of love-poetry transcending in amount\r\nno less than in loveliness all poetry of the same class from the pen\r\nof any other man. If immortality is deservedly awarded to a single\r\nmasterpiece like the _Burial of Sir John Moore_ or the _Pervigilium\r\nVeneris_, it should not be difficult to estimate his claims whose\r\nsimilar masterpieces are counted by scores. Perhaps the greatest of his\r\nbeauties is the complete naturalness of his ceaseless succession of\r\nthoughts transcendently exquisite. If Petrarch has not the thrilling\r\nnote or transparent spirituality of Dante, his perfect form represents\r\na higher stage of artistic development--too high, indeed, to be\r\nmaintained by his successors. A just parallel might be drawn between\r\nthe three great sonnet-writers of the Latin peoples, Dante, Petrarch,\r\nCamoens; the three orders of architecture, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian;\r\nand the three great ancient dramatists.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that Petrarch does not appear as the representative\r\npoet of the mediæval or of any other period. Horace and Ovid would\r\nhave admired him as much as his contemporaries did, and he is as fresh\r\nand bright in the nineteenth as in the fourteenth century. Many have\r\npursued him, none have overtaken him. His prose works, on the contrary,\r\nbear the stamp of their age, and exist for ours mainly as curiosities\r\nand documentary illustrations of bygone manners and ways of thinking.\r\nThis was inevitable; he could not have been the literary sovereign of\r\nhis age had he been very greatly in advance of it. He looked down upon\r\nit sufficiently to dislike it, as he tells us, and prepare a better. As\r\na man he had shining virtues and few faults, except such as are almost\r\ninseparable from the characters of poets, orators, and lovers, and\r\nwhich men like Dante only avoid at the cost of less amiable failings.\r\nHis nearest parallel is perhaps with Cicero, and would appear closer\r\nif Petrarch had, or Cicero had not, been called upon to take a highly\r\nresponsible part in public affairs.\r\n\r\nOf Petrarch’s vast influence upon English poetry since the time of\r\nWyatt and Surrey, who may be justly called his disciples, it is\r\nneedless to say anything, except that it is even more to be traced in\r\nthe general refinement of diction than by the imitation of particular\r\npassages.\r\n\r\nThe best critical edition is Mestica’s, founded mainly upon\r\nscrupulous examination of a manuscript partly written by Petrarch\r\nhimself, partly by an amanuensis under his direction. It may almost\r\nbe wished that Mestica had not such good authority for some of his\r\ndisturbances of time-hallowed readings. By much the best exegetical\r\ncommentary is Leopardi’s, a model of pregnant conciseness, and\r\ninvaluable for clearing up difficulties, although frequently proffering\r\nexplanation where explanation seems needless. The late Henry\r\nReeve’s English biography, though condensed, is fully adequate. The\r\nappreciation of the Petrarchan sonnet-forms, never to be tampered with\r\nwithout detriment, has been mainly promoted in England by the late\r\nCharles Tomlinson.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] Koerting distinctly affirms that it is not. The history of Carlyle\r\nand the Squire Papers evinces the extreme danger of touching, tasting,\r\nor handling in similar cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n                               BOCCACCIO\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the works of the third great Italian writer cannot be compared to\r\nDante’s for sublimity, or to Petrarch’s for perfection of style, the\r\nmost important of them is of even greater significance in the history\r\nof culture. By his _Decameron_ GIOVANNI BOCCACCIO[8] endowed his\r\ncountry with a classic prose, and won for himself a unique place as the\r\nfirst modern novelist.\r\n\r\nBoccaccio always speaks of himself as “of Certaldo,” a small Tuscan\r\ntown under Florentine dominion, where he possessed some properly. It\r\nwould seem, however, from his own expressions, not to have been his\r\nbirthplace. This was most probably Florence. The early legend of his\r\nbirth at Paris rests upon a too absolute identification of himself\r\nwith a character in his _Ameto_. His birth probably took place in\r\n1313; and, if not early orphaned of his mother, he must have been an\r\nillegitimate child. His father, a Florentine merchant of the prudent\r\nand thrifty type, had him taught grammar and arithmetic, sent him into\r\na counting-house at thirteen, and four years afterwards placed him\r\nwith a mercantile firm at Naples. When, after two years, the youth’s\r\ndistaste to trade proved insuperable, the father made him study law at\r\nthe Neapolitan University. It is not likely that he gave much attention\r\nto so dry a subject amid the distractions of the lively city, where\r\nhe was insensibly receiving the inspiration of his future poetry and\r\nfiction.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the accusation of stinginess brought against his\r\nfather, Boccaccio must apparently have possessed considerable means,\r\nmixing in the best society of Naples. He probably owed much to the\r\nFlorentine extraction of Nicola Acciajuoli, a leading personage, and\r\nsubsequently Grand Seneschal of the kingdom. By 1338 he had progressed\r\nso far as to fall in love with the lady he has celebrated as Fiammetta,\r\nbut whose real name was Maria, putative daughter of the Count of\r\nAquino, but generally believed to be the offspring of King Robert\r\nhimself. Fiammetta was married. The degree in which she returned his\r\npassion is uncertain, but she appears to have exerted considerable\r\ninfluence upon his career as an author. He composed the _Filocopo_\r\nfor her entertainment about 1339, and the close of his activity as\r\nan imaginative writer about twelve years afterwards coincides with\r\nthe probable period of her death. _Ameto_ and _Fiammetta_, in both\r\nof which she is celebrated were written after Boccaccio’s return to\r\nFlorence whither he was recalled by his unsympathising father about\r\n1340; here the wild oats sown at Naples came up in a plentiful crop of\r\nfiction and poetry. Literary productions must have occupied most of\r\nBoccaccio’s time until 1345, when, probably on account of his father’s\r\nremarriage, he returned to Naples, where he is said to have begun the\r\n_Decameron_ under the patronage of Queen Joanna. In 1348 the pestilence\r\nwhich devastated Florence carried off his father. Boccaccio returned\r\nin 1349 to arrange family affairs, and thenceforth appears in quite\r\na new light, as a trusty diplomatist, the author of various manuals\r\n(_Genealogiæ deorum gentilium_, _De casibus virorum illustrium_, &c.)\r\nof the information most sought for in the age, and, under Petrarch’s\r\ndirection, a chief agent in the promotion of humanistic studies. Copies\r\nof Terence and Apuleius are extant in his handwriting.\r\n\r\nOne of Boccaccio’s first duties after he had settled himself in his\r\nnative city was to entertain Petrarch upon his visit in 1350, and one\r\nof his first public missions, performed in the following year, was to\r\nsolicit him to fix his residence at Florence and enter the service of\r\nthe Republic. Petrarch declined to entrust his repose to so unstable\r\na community, but his acquaintance with Boccaccio ripened into an\r\nintimacy which might have been compared to that of Goethe and Schiller\r\nif Boccaccio had not gracefully and judiciously assumed a tone of\r\ndeference to the acknowledged sovereign of contemporary literature. He\r\nis indefatigable in literary suit and service. His piety towards Dante\r\nas well as Petrarch leads him to transcribe for the latter the _Divine\r\nComedy_. His equal affection for Petrarch and classical studies made\r\nhim at Petrarch’s instigation entertain an erudite but uncomfortable\r\nGreek, Leontius Pilatus, who rendered Homer for him into very lame\r\nLatin; but still it was Homer that he read; while the mediæval epicist\r\nof the Trojan war, Josephus Iscanus, had known his theme only in Dares\r\nPhrygius and Dictys Cretensis.\r\n\r\nLandor has delightfully depicted a supposed visit of Petrarch to\r\nBoccaccio at Certaldo; one only regrets that the conversation of the\r\npoets should turn so exclusively on Dante. Petrarch rendered his\r\nfriend one inestimable service in dissuading him from the renunciation\r\nof the world, into which he had been almost scared by the prophecies\r\nand denunciations of an expiring monk. Boccaccio nevertheless so\r\nfar profited by these admonitions as to write nothing more to which\r\nmorality could take exception. Shortly before his end he received one\r\nof the most honourable and appropriate commissions with which he could\r\nhave been entrusted, that of delivering public lectures on Dante, which\r\nhe had carried down to the seventeenth canto of the _Inferno_, when\r\ndeath overtook him on December 21, 1375.\r\n\r\nThe _Filocopo_, Boccaccio’s first and longest work of fiction, would\r\nbe thought intolerably tedious at the present day, when one must be\r\nindeed [Greek: philokopos] to get through it. It forms nevertheless\r\na most important landmark in the history of literature, for it\r\nsignalises the transition from the metrical romance to the pure novel.\r\nSomething similar had been attempted two centuries earlier in the\r\ndelightful miniature romance of mingled prose and verse, _Aucassin and\r\nNicolette_, but the example had not been followed. About the middle\r\nof the thirteenth century the _Novellino_ had been compiled with a\r\ndistinct moral purpose, but its hundred tales are rather anecdotes\r\nthan novelettes. The _Filocopo_ is founded upon the ancient lay of\r\nFloris and Blanchefleur, which Boccaccio has converted into prose, with\r\na copious admixture of new incidents, characters, and descriptions.\r\nThere is little semblance of probability in the incidents, or accurate\r\ndelineation in the characters, while the diction, though polished,\r\nis full of what would now be justly considered affectation and bad\r\ntaste. In the fourteenth century it was neither, but the faithful\r\nimage of the mental ferment inevitably produced by the irruption of\r\nthe classical spirit into the contracted world of the Middle Age.\r\nEverything, indeed, was confused and bewildered; as the blind man\r\nsuddenly restored to sight saw men as trees, so the classical forms\r\nappeared most strangely distorted in the mediæval atmosphere. This\r\nignorance, which might have excited the reprehension of critics in\r\nBoccaccio’s age, had such then existed, is the salvation of his book\r\nin ours: his mistaken erudition has become charming naïveté, and the\r\neloquence which no longer impresses at least amuses. For its own day\r\nthe _Filocopo_ was an epoch-making work, and traces of its style may be\r\nmet with until the displacement of the ideal romance by the novel of\r\nmanners, a development of which the fourteenth century had no notion;\r\nalthough Petronius, as yet unknown, had given an example as early as\r\nthe age of Nero. Boccaccio’s affinities are rather with Apuleius, whom\r\nhe frequently follows in the _Decameron_.\r\n\r\nThe _Ameto_ of Boccaccio also possesses considerable importance\r\nin literary history, being the first well-defined modern instance\r\nof an important _genre_, the pastoral romance, afterwards carried\r\nto perfection by Sannazaro and Montemayor; and also of a literary\r\nartifice, the interweaving of several stories to compose a whole. The\r\nstories are not very attractive, and the combination is not very well\r\nmanaged, but the idea was an important contribution to literature, and,\r\nthough Longus is more likely to find emulators than Boccaccio, the\r\npastoral romance still has a future before it. The tales are supposed\r\nto record the experiences of shepherdesses who personify the virtues,\r\nand that placed in the mouth of Fiammetta is certainly in some measure\r\nautobiographical.\r\n\r\nMore autobiographical still, and consequently nearer to the truth\r\nof nature, is the romance called after Fiammetta, the precursor of\r\nthe modern psychological novel, although a germ that long remained\r\nunproductive in unkindly soil. Written, probably, about 1346, it is\r\nhalf-way in style between the _Filocopo_ and the _Decameron_, and the\r\nplot is simplicity itself in comparison with the bewildering intricacy\r\nof the former. It is merely Fiammetta’s own detail of her unfortunate\r\npassion for a young Tuscan, and her lamentation for his inconstancy\r\nafter his recall to his home by a stern father. The auto-biographical\r\nelement is unquestionable, but it is extremely unlikely that Boccaccio\r\nwould have accused himself of infidelity in the person of Pamfilo. It\r\nhas been conjectured to be the work of some anonymous writer who took\r\nhim as a hero; but had this been so, the fact would assuredly have\r\ncome to light. It is more probable that it represents, not Fiammetta’s\r\nfeelings, but his own, and that, to avoid gossip, or for artistic\r\nreasons, he inverted the situation and the characters. Fiammetta\r\nundoubtedly excites more interest than Pamfilo could have done, and her\r\nsufferings appear in a more tragic light as the penalty of her breach\r\nof conjugal fidelity.\r\n\r\nIt may also well be the case that Boccaccio, finding his affection for\r\nFiammetta on the wane, anticipated Goethe by hastening to cleanse his\r\nbosom of the perilous stuff while it yet retained sufficient vitality\r\nfor the purposes of art. However this may be, Fiammetta has the merits\r\nand defects of Werther, real pathos and truth to nature associated\r\nwith the tedium hardly separable from a long monologue, however well\r\ncomposed; and Boccaccio’s style here, although a great advance on\r\nthat of the _Filocopo_, still suffers from ambitious rhetoric and\r\na superfluity of adjectives. Great part of the book, nevertheless,\r\nattains the level of true eloquence; and Boccaccio did much for prose\r\nwhen he proved it to be an apt medium for the expression of passions\r\nheretofore chiefly restricted to verse.\r\n\r\nHis fame, nevertheless, rests on his _Decameron_, for here he attained\r\nthe perfection which elsewhere he only indicated. Among many lights in\r\nwhich this epoch-making book may be regarded is that of an alliance\r\nbetween the elegant but superfine literature of courts and the vigorous\r\nbut homely literature of the people. Nobles and ladies, accustomed\r\nto far-fetched and ornate compositions like the _Filocopo_, heard\r\nthe same stories which amused the common people, told in a style\r\nwhich the uneducated too could apprehend and enjoy, but purged of all\r\nroughness and vulgarity, and, in truth, such masterpieces of clear,\r\nforcible prose as the greatest scholars had till then been unable to\r\nproduce. All that we know of Boccaccio leads to the conclusion that\r\nhis true mission was to have been a poet of the people, such an one\r\nas the unknown balladists who in simple ages have given immortal form\r\nto popular traditions, or as the Burnses and Heines who in artificial\r\nperiods have gone back to the fountains of popular song. Neither of\r\nthese was a possible part in the fourteenth century; but if Boccaccio\r\nis in no respect archaic, the sap of his best work is drawn from the\r\nsoil of popular interest and sympathy.\r\n\r\nFew of the stories are of Boccaccio’s invention; the originals of\r\nsome may be discovered in traditionary folk-lore, of others in French\r\nfabliaux or classical or Oriental writers; very many are probably true\r\nhistories in every respect but for the alteration of the names. This\r\nis Boccaccio’s best defence against the charge of licentiousness--he\r\ndid not, like so many others, write with the express purpose of\r\nstimulating the passions, but reproduced the ordinary talk of hours\r\nof relaxation, giving it the attraction of a pure and classic style.\r\nThe share of the ladies as narrators of or listeners to these loose\r\nstories, so repugnant to ideal conceptions of the female character,\r\nis not only explained by the manners of the time, but has greatly\r\ncontributed to the charm of his work by tempering its licence with a\r\nrefinement best appreciated by comparison with such similar collections\r\nas the _Facetiæ_ of Poggio. After all, the sensuous element, though\r\nconspicuous, is not predominant in the _Decameron_, and few books\r\ncontain more or finer traits of courtesy, humanity, and generosity.\r\n\r\nProse fiction had existed before Boccaccio, and his manner had been in\r\nsome measure anticipated by some of the tales which have found their\r\nway into the _Cento Novelle Antiche_, but he was probably the first to\r\nemploy in Europe the Oriental device of setting his stories in a frame.\r\nThe structure of the _Decameron_ is too generally known to render it\r\nnecessary to more than barely mention its scheme as a succession of\r\nstories told by ten persons in ten successive days, on the feigned\r\noccasion of the retirement of a _lieta brigata_ to a delightful\r\nretreat from the plague which devastated Florence in 1348. Many among\r\nus will think that they ought to have remained to aid their perishing\r\nfellow-countrymen, and, what is more, would themselves have done so.\r\nBut it would be absurd to blame the fourteenth century for a conception\r\nof public duty and a completeness of organisation in public calamity\r\nwhich did not and could not exist in it. Mediæval Italy produced but\r\none Florence Nightingale, and she was a saint. The step once taken, the\r\nexclusion of all unpleasant tidings was its indispensable corollary;\r\nand hence the scene of the story-telling, with its groves and orchards,\r\ngardens and fountains, charming company and frank converse, has ever\r\nremained one of the green spots on which imagination loves to rest.\r\n\r\nSuch an ideal of cultivated society afforded no room for the vivacity\r\nof delineation so admirable in Chaucer’s portraits derived from all\r\nclasses; yet the prologue and the little introductory passages to each\r\nday are, with their feeling for landscape and poetic truth, even more\r\ndelightful than the stories themselves. If, as seems probable, some\r\nof these were composed at Naples before the pestilence, this lovely\r\nframework must have been an afterthought. Of Boccaccio’s greatness\r\nas a master of narrative, nothing need here be said, unless that his\r\nprogressiveness is even more surprising than his talent. Ten years\r\n(1339-49) had sufficed to raise him from the eloquent but confused\r\nand hyperbolical style of the _Filocopo_ to the perfection of Italian\r\nnarrative. He was now the unapproached model of later story-tellers,\r\nwho can, indeed, produce stronger effects by the employment of stronger\r\nmeans, but have never been able to rival him on his own ground of easy,\r\nunaffected simplicity.\r\n\r\nTwo minor works of Boccaccio, written subsequently to the _Decameron_,\r\ndeserve a word of notice--the _Corbaccio_, a lampoon upon a widow\r\nwho had jilted him, which does him no credit morally, but evinces\r\nmuch satiric force; and the _Urbano_, a pretty little romance of the\r\nidentification of an emperor’s abandoned son--the genuineness of which,\r\nhowever, has sometimes been doubted.\r\n\r\nIt was the constant destiny of Boccaccio to make epochs--producing\r\nsomething absolutely or virtually new, and tracing out the ways in\r\nwhich his successors, far as they might outstrip him, were bound to\r\nwalk. We have seen that the heroic, the pastoral, the familiar romance\r\nowed, if not their actual birth, at least their first considerable\r\nbeginnings to him; and his activity was no less important in the domain\r\nof narrative poetry. He may not have been the inventor of the octave\r\nstanza, but undoubtedly he was the first to show its supreme fitness\r\nfor narrative, and thus mark out the channel in which the epic genius\r\nof Italy has flowed ever since. The peculiar grace of her language,\r\nand its affluence of rhymes, adapt it especially to this singularly\r\nelegant, if not massive or sublime, form of versification, superior for\r\nnarrative purposes to the sinuous and digressive _terza rima_, or to\r\nItalian counterfeits of the majestic blank verse of England. It could\r\nnot be expected that Boccaccio’s attempts should at first display all\r\nthe perfection his metre is capable of receiving, he is undoubtedly\r\nlax and diffuse. Yet all the main recommendations of the octave are\r\ndiscoverable in his _Teseide_ and _Filostrato_, poems especially\r\ninteresting to English readers from the imitation--frequently\r\ntranslation--of them in Chaucer’s _Knight’s Tale_ and _Troilus_.\r\nThe _Teseide_ is the earlier, having been composed shortly after\r\nBoccaccio’s return to Florence in 1340 for the gratification of his\r\nNeapolitan mistress; while the _Filostrato_, apparently composed upon\r\nhis second visit to Naples about 1347, is a disguised satire upon her\r\ninconstancy.\r\n\r\nBoth from the acuteness of feeling thus engendered, and from the\r\nrapid progress Boccaccio had in the interim made in the poetic art,\r\nthe _Filostrato_ is the more powerful and poetical composition; the\r\nprosperity of Troilus’s love while returned, for example, is described\r\nin the liveliest colours and with the truest feeling. The _Teseide_,\r\non the other hand, has the advantage of a more dignified and heroic\r\nstory, known to the English reader, not only from Chaucer, but from\r\nDryden’s imitation of the latter in his _Palamon and Arcite_. It also\r\ngave the plot to Fletcher’s _Two Noble Kinsmen_. Boccaccio’s source\r\nis uncertain, but is believed to have been some Greek romance written\r\nunder the later Roman Empire. If so, he can only have been acquainted\r\nwith it in a Latin translation, now lost as well as the original. His\r\nown poem was translated back into Greek in a miserable Romaic version\r\nprinted in 1529. For the tale of _Troilus and Cressida_ he had Guido de\r\nColonna’s history of the Trojan war, itself indebted for this episode\r\nto an ancient metrical romance.\r\n\r\nThe little idyllic narrative _Ninfale Fiesolano_ is one of the most\r\nattractive of Boccaccio’s minor writings. It relates the breach of\r\n“Diana’s law” by one of her nymphs, and its tragical consequences--the\r\nsuicide of the lover, and the metamorphosis, or rather the assumption\r\nof the nymph into the waters of a river; although the fruit of their\r\nunion survives to become a hero and found the city of Fiesole. If, as\r\nis probable, somewhat later than the _Filostrato_, this pleasing little\r\nstory evinces Boccaccio’s increasing mastery of the octave couplet,\r\nease of narrative, and power of natural description. Had he continued\r\nto compose in verse, he would probably have ranked higher among Italian\r\npoets than he does now.\r\n\r\nThe _Amorosa Visione_ is an earlier and very different work. It is\r\nwritten in _terza rima_, and betrays an evident ambition to imitate\r\nDante, while in its turn it has not been without influence on\r\nPetrarch’s _Trionfi_. Like the latter, it testifies to the mediæval\r\nlove of allegories and stately shows, and may well have aided to\r\ninspire the _Polifilo_ of Francesco Colonna. The poet is conducted\r\nthrough a number of visions illustrative of the pomps and vanities of\r\nthe world, and the poem leaves off just as, by command of his mistress,\r\nhe is about to attempt the narrow way which he should have taken at\r\nfirst. Written apparently for the entertainment of a courtly circle,\r\nand encumbered with fantastic acrostics, it reveals little of the deep\r\nfeeling of its predecessor or its successor; but if regarded simply as\r\nthe description of a series of pageants, must be allowed the merits\r\nof fertile invention and glowing colour. Boccaccio’s enthusiastic\r\npraise of Dante, whom he calls the lord of all science, and the source\r\nof everything, if there be anything, excellent in himself, is highly\r\nhonourable to him.\r\n\r\nA good example of Boccaccio’s epic vein is afforded by the prayer of\r\nEmilia to Diana in the _Teseide_, uttered when Palamon and Arcite are\r\nabout to fight for her sake. For this, as for several other versions,\r\nthe writer is indebted to Miss Ellen Clerke:\r\n\r\n      _She thus in broken vows 'mid sighs began:\r\n        “Chaste Goddess, who dost purify the glades,\r\n      And of a maiden train dost lead the van,\r\n        And him chastises who thy law evades,\r\n      As lost Actæon learned in briefest span,\r\n        Who, young and hapless, smit 'mid sylvan shades,\r\n      Not by scourge whip, but by thy wrath celestial,\r\n      Fled as a stag in transformation bestial._\r\n\r\n      _“Hear, then, my voice, if worthy of thy care,\r\n        While I implore by thy divinity,\r\n      In triple form, accept my lowly prayer,\r\n        And if it be an easy task to thee\r\n      To perfect it--I prithee strive, if e’er\r\n        Soft pity filled thy heart so cold and free\r\n      For maiden client who in prayer addrest thee,\r\n      And who for grace or favour did request thee._\r\n\r\n      _“For I, a maiden of thy maiden train,\r\n        Am fitter far, with quiver and with bow,\r\n      To roam the forest, than 'neath love’s soft reign\r\n        To do a husband’s will; and if thou go\r\n      In memory back, thou must in mind retain\r\n        How harder face than granite did we show\r\n      ’Gainst headlong Venus’ law, based not on reason,\r\n      But headlong passion, to its promptings treason._\r\n\r\n      _“And if it be my better fate to stay\r\n        A little maid amid thy vestal throng,\r\n      The fierce and burning fumes do thou allay\r\n        Sprung from desires so passionate and strong\r\n      Of both the enamoured youths my love who pray,\r\n        And both for joy of love from me do long,\r\n      Let peace supplant between them war’s contention,\r\n      Since grief to me, thou know’st, is their dissension._\r\n\r\n      _“And if it be reserved for me by fate\r\n        To Juno’s law subjected now to be,\r\n      Ah, pardon thou my lapse from maiden state,\r\n        Nor therefore be my prayer refused by thee;\r\n      On others’ will, thou seest, condemned to wait,\r\n        My actions must conform to their decree:\r\n      Then help me, Goddess, hear my prayer thus lowly,\r\n      Who still deserve thy favour high and holy.”_\r\n\r\nBoccaccio thought little of his own poetry, would have destroyed his\r\nsonnets but for the remonstrances of Petrarch, and laments that even\r\nthe incitement of Fiammetta is unavailing to spur him on to the Temple\r\nof Fame. Yet in another place he says that he has spared no pains to\r\nexcel:\r\n\r\n      _Study I have not spared, or scanted time:\r\n      Now rest unto my labour I permit,\r\n      Lamenting this so tittle could avail\r\n      To raise me to that eminence sublime._\r\n\r\nThis judgment was unreasonably severe. It is true, nevertheless, that\r\nBoccaccio would have gained more renown as a poet if the taste of his\r\ntime had permitted him to seek inspiration among the people for his\r\nverses, as he did for his stories. How exquisite he could sometimes be\r\nis shown by two of the sonnets translated by Rossetti--versions, it\r\nmust be owned, which surpass the originals:\r\n\r\n      _Love steered my course, while yet the sun rode high,\r\n        On Scylla’s waters to a myrtle-grove:\r\n        The heaven was still and the sea did not move;\r\n      Yet now and then a little breeze went by,\r\n      Stirring the tops of trees against the sky:\r\n        And then I heard a song as glad as love,\r\n        So sweet that never yet the like thereof\r\n      Was heard in any mortal company.\r\n      “A nymph, a goddess, or an angel sings\r\n        Unto herself, within this chosen place\r\n        Of ancient loves,” so said I at that sound.\r\n      And there my lady, 'mid the shadowings\r\n        Of myrtle-trees, 'mid flowers and grassy space,\r\n        Singing I saw, with others who sat round._\r\n\r\n      _By a clear well, within a little field\r\n        Full of green grass and flowers of every hue,\r\n        Sat three young girls, relating (as I knew)\r\n      Their loves; and each had twined a bough to shield\r\n      Her lovely face; and the green leaves did yield\r\n        The golden hair their shadow; while the two\r\n        Sweet colours mingled, both blown lightly through\r\n      With a soft wind for ever stirred and stilled.\r\n      After a little while one of them said\r\n        (I heard her), “Think! if ere the next hour struck,\r\n        Each of our lovers should come here to-day,\r\n      Think you that we should fly or feel afraid?”\r\n        To whom the others answered, “From such luck\r\n        A girl would be a fool to run away.”_\r\n\r\nApart from the merits of his writings, Boccaccio might rest a claim to\r\nno ordinary renown as the creator of classic Italian prose; and even if\r\nhe had found this instrument ready to his hand, his work with it might\r\nalone have assured him immortality. Perhaps he has a still higher title\r\nto fame in his quality as a great originator, achieving, indeed, no\r\nconsummate work except the _Decameron_, but reconnoitring the unknown\r\nworld through which the human spirit travels, and opening out new paths\r\non every side as he steers “bound upon beating wing to golden bough.”\r\nAs the first effective exemplar of the heroic and pastoral romance and\r\nof the epic in octave stanza, as the principal populariser of classical\r\nlore, his influence will be felt to the end of time. The books which\r\ngave him this power are, indeed, comparatively forgotten. On the other\r\nhand, the great marvel of his _Decameron_ is its undying freshness.\r\nThe language is as terse and bright, the tale as readable as ever:\r\nthe commentator may exercise his research in detecting the sources of\r\nthe stories, but has little to do in explaining obsolete diction or\r\nobsolete manners.\r\n\r\nIn morals and conduct, until his latter days, Boccaccio seems to have\r\nbeen a perfect type of the gay and easy class of Florentine citizens,\r\nand as remote as possible from the wary and penurious burghers depicted\r\nin his tale of the Pot of Basil. Apart from the fair and courteous\r\npresence revealed in the _Decameron_, his principal titles to moral\r\nesteem are his disinterested love of culture, his enthusiasm for\r\nhis master Dante, and his obsequious yet graceful demeanour towards\r\nPetrarch, embodying sentiments which could have found no entrance into\r\nan ungenerous breast.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] When preceded by the Christian name, “Boccaccio” ought, in\r\nstrictness, to lose the final vowel, but this would seem pedantic in\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n                         THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nA just remark of Coventry Patmore’s on the contrast between Dante and\r\nShakespeare in their relation to their respective literatures might\r\nbe extended to the Italian literature of the fourteenth century in\r\ngeneral: it has lofty peaks, but little elevated table-land. Dante,\r\nPetrarch, and Boccaccio tower above their contemporaries, who, viewed\r\nfrom such eminences, are almost indiscernible. It might have been\r\nexpected, nevertheless, that the example of surpassing excellence,\r\nwhich could complain of no want of popularity or recognition, would\r\nhave powerfully stimulated contemporaries and successors, and that, as\r\nHomer gave birth to the Cyclic poets, and Alcæus followed in the wake\r\nof Alcman, the great Italians would have appeared as the immediate\r\nprogenitors of epicists, lyrists, and novelists of kindred if inferior\r\npower. On the contrary, the century from the death of Boccaccio to\r\nthe appearance of Lorenzo de’ Medici as a poet is the most barren in\r\nItalian literary history. It produces no vernacular writer of genius,\r\nand but few of eminent talent. It is indeed no reproach to it to have\r\nbrought forth no second Dante, or to have failed, like all other ages,\r\nto reproduce the inimitable perfection of Petrarch. But it might have\r\nbeen anticipated that the new ways opened out by Boccaccio alike in\r\nmetrical epic and in prose narrative would have been followed up, and\r\nthat history and allied branches of literature would have assumed a\r\nclassic form.\r\n\r\nLittle of the kind occurred, and classical study itself ceased to\r\nproduce a vivifying effect upon letters. This may have been partly\r\nowing to excessive admiration for the ancient writers, degenerating\r\ninto pedantic imitation; partly from the great demand for Latin\r\ntranslations from the Greek, and Latin official correspondence,\r\nencouraging Latin composition at the expense of the vernacular; but\r\ncannot be wholly explained by any cause peculiar to Italy, for the same\r\nphenomenon manifested itself over Europe. Chaucer, who had carried the\r\npoetry of England so high, had no successors; and it would be difficult\r\nto point to a work of genius anywhere, except the _Imitatio Christi_,\r\nwhich might have been produced in any Christian age, and the _Amadis of\r\nGaul_, the parent of the romances of chivalry, composed in Portugal or\r\nSpain about the beginning of the fifteenth century. How far this is to\r\nbe ascribed to the Black Death, which, in sweeping away so much of the\r\nexisting generation, blighted so much of the hope of the future; how\r\nfar to calamities like the Great Schism and the Jacquerie; how far to\r\ncauses unfathomable by the human intellect, will always be a question.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that, while material civilisation continued to develop,\r\nand Leonardo Bruni, thinking only of the cultivation of Greek, is\r\nable to say, “Letters at this time grew mightily in Italy,” creative\r\ngenius received a check; and the standard of public virtue in most\r\ncountries fell lower than it had ever been, or has been again. We can\r\nonly note the few who in Italy, otherwise than as classical scholars,\r\ndid anything to vindicate their age from the imputation of intellectual\r\nbarrenness. Two didactic poems with epic affinities, produced, one\r\nshortly before, the other shortly after the death of Boccaccio, attest\r\nmore than pages of panegyric the power with which Dante controlled\r\nthe imaginations of his countrymen. FAZIO DEGLI UBERTI, a Florentine\r\nof whose life little is known, except that he spent most of it in\r\nexile, and died about 1367, seems to have thought that if Dante had\r\nappropriated heaven, hell, and purgatory, the earth at least remained\r\nfor himself. He undertook to describe, in a number of cantos in _terza\r\nrima_, his perlustration of it under the escort of a singular guide,\r\nthe Latin topographer Solinus. What Solinus is to Virgil, Uberti is\r\nto Dante; yet, though an uninspired, he is not a contemptible writer.\r\nHis geographical epic the _Dittamondo_ (Discourse of the World) may\r\nbe unduly prejudiced in the eyes of English readers from Rossetti’s\r\nrendering of a canto in blank verse. It would indeed have been a waste\r\nof time to have striven to reproduce the original metre, yet Uberti’s\r\ntercets glide with an ease and fluency of which the blank verse gives\r\nno notion. The poem is not altogether destitute of poetical spirit;\r\none conception, that of the forlorn Genius of Rome herself guiding\r\nthe poet to her ruins, is truly fine, but force was wanting to work\r\nit out. Otherwise it is chiefly interesting as a repertory of the\r\ngeographical knowledge and fancies of the age. The canto on England\r\nhas been translated by Rossetti, and is entertaining from its naïveté.\r\nUberti must have been an accomplished man, for he intersperses French\r\nand Provençal verses with his Italian. He is more truly a poet in his\r\nlyrical than in his epic performances, if, at least, the sonnets and\r\ncanzoni which pass under his name are really his. One, translated\r\nby Rossetti, has so much poetical merit as to have been frequently\r\nascribed to Dante:\r\n\r\n      _I look at the crisp golden-threaded hair\r\n        Whereof, to thrall my heart, Love twists a net;\r\n      Using at times a string of pearls for bait,\r\n        And sometimes with a single rose therein.\r\n      I look into her eyes, which unaware,\r\n        Though mine own eyes to her heart penetrate;\r\n        Their splendour, that is excellently great,\r\n        To the sun’s radiance seeming near akin,\r\n        Vet from herself a sweeter light to win.\r\n      So that I, gazing on that lovely one,\r\n        Discourse in this wise with my secret thought:\r\n        “Woe’s me! why am I not,\r\n      Even as my wish, alone with her alone,--\r\n        That hair of hers, so heavily uplaid,\r\n        To shed down braid by braid,\r\n      And make myself two mirrors of her eyes\r\n      Within whose light all other glory dies?_”\r\n\r\nAnother writer of mark, nearer than Fazio to Dante both in style and\r\nsubject, is FREDERICO FREZZI, citizen and bishop of Foligno, who died\r\nat the Council of Constance in 1416. His _Quatriregio_, a moral poem\r\ndescribing the author’s progress through the realms of Love, Pluto,\r\nthe Vices and Virtue, so close an imitation of Dante as to border upon\r\nservility, is, notwithstanding, not a mean performance. Frezzi has\r\nconsiderable rhetorical, if not much poetical power, and many passages\r\nare really impressive. The diction also is good; but the book’s chief\r\nrepute at this day is among artists, on account of the remarkable\r\ndesigns adorning the edition of 1506, which present an affinity to\r\nBotticelli’s illustrations of Dante, and have been attributed, although\r\non insufficient authority, to Luca Signorelli. The poem was republished\r\nat Foligno in 1725, with a learned commentary, of which it was in\r\ngreat need. MATTEO PALMIERI’S poem, _Città di Vita_, probably much in\r\nFrezzi’s style, arouses interest from its having been suppressed as\r\nheretical, but its poetical merit has never yet sufficed to allure a\r\npublisher. “The object,” says Symonds, who read it in MS., “is to show\r\nhow free-will is innate in men.” It is founded upon an actual vision,\r\naccording lo the assertion of the author.\r\n\r\nMany other poets might be mentioned, but they are now mere names,\r\nexcept SENUCCIO DEL BENE, chiefly renowned as Petrarch’s friend, but\r\nhimself a graceful writer, and two of considerably later date, of\r\none of whom it may be truly if paradoxically said that he is chiefly\r\nremembered for being forgotten. This is DOMENICO BURCHIELLO, a standing\r\nexample of the fickleness of popular taste. He was a Florentine, who\r\nlived from about 1400 to 1448, and composed numerous burlesque sonnets\r\n_alla coda_ (with a tag of three lines), which retained sufficient\r\nvitality to go through thirty editions soon after the invention of\r\nprinting, but are now inevitably neglected, inasmuch as the Florentine\r\nslang in which they are mainly composed has ceased to be amusing, or\r\neven intelligible. The other poet of the period, GIUSTO DE’ CONTI,\r\na jurist, who lived at the court of Sigismondo Malatesta, Prince\r\nof Rimini, and died there about 1452, is remarkable as the chief\r\ncontemporary imitator of Petrarch, whom he followed with such servility\r\nas greatly to impair the credit otherwise due to him for the sweetness\r\nof his verse and the occasional dignity of his style. His collection\r\nof sonnets, entitled _La Bella Mano_, from its perpetual reference to\r\nthe beauties of his lady’s hand, stands out at all events, as even\r\nan inferior work might have done, from the almost total poetical\r\nbarrenness of the middle of the fifteenth century, otherwise only\r\nrelieved by the elegant sonnets of another Petrarchist, Bonaccorso da\r\nMontemagno, and the popular carols which gained Leonardo Giustiniani\r\ndeserved reputation.\r\n\r\nMore genuine poetry is to be found in the occasional lyrics of two\r\nwriters near the end of the fourteenth century, chiefly eminent in\r\na different species of composition, the novelette. FRANCO SACCHETTI\r\nand GIOVANNI FIORENTINO are artists in words, and men of true poetic\r\nfeeling. A canzonet of Sacchetti’s (the earliest Italian poet, says\r\nRossetti, with whom playfulness was a characteristic), _O vaghe\r\nmontanine pastorelle_, was so popular as to have been transmitted\r\nfor some generations by oral recitation, while his novelettes, until\r\nprinted in the eighteenth century, existed only in a single mutilated\r\nmanuscript. This is the conclusion of Rossetti’s translation of this\r\ncharming lyric:\r\n\r\n      _I think your beauties might make great complaint\r\n        Of being thus shown ever mount and dell;\r\n      Because no city is so excellent\r\n        But that your stay therein were honourable.\r\n        In very truth now does it like you well\r\n      To live so poorly on the hillside here?_\r\n\r\n      _Better it liketh one of us, pardie,\r\n        Behind her flock to seek the pasture-stance,\r\n      Far better than it liketh one of ye\r\n        To ride unto your curtained rooms and dance.\r\n        We seek no riches, neither golden chance,\r\n      Save wealth of flowers to weave into our hair._\r\n\r\n      _Ballad, if I were now as once I was,\r\n        I’d make myself a shepherd on some hill,\r\n      And, without telling any one, would pass\r\n        Where these girls went, and follow at their will,\r\n        And “Mary,” and “Martin,” we would murmur still,\r\n      And I would be for ever where they were._\r\n\r\nThis exquisite poem, however, rather belongs to the late fourteenth\r\nthan to the early fifteenth century, as do other songs of equal beauty\r\nby Sacchetti and his contemporaries, which contrast favourably with\r\nearlier Italian lyrics by their brevity and simplicity. This is partly\r\nattributable to their having been in general written for music. Some\r\nof the most charming examples have been collected in Carducci’s _Studi\r\nLetterari_.\r\n\r\nSacchetti and Giovanni mark the termination of the _Trecentisti_\r\nperiod. Many writings of their contemporaries have been printed as\r\nmodels of pure diction, but are otherwise too unimportant to deserve\r\nindependent notice in a literary history[9]. After the beginning of\r\nthe fifteenth century Italian prose for a while declined, mainly from\r\nthe false standard of excellence produced by exaggerated enthusiasm\r\nfor the newly recovered classics. Neglecting the spirit, though only\r\ntoo attentive to the letter, of these models, writers corrupted their\r\ndiction with Latinisms. The best books were histories, and the best\r\nof these were written in Latin. It might have been said that to find\r\na really good vernacular historian we must go back to the fourteenth\r\ncentury, were it not for the doubts which beset the alleged chronicle\r\nof DINO COMPAGNI, which professedly details events at Florence\r\nfrom 1286 to 1318. The question of its genuineness has aroused the\r\nsharpest controversy, which cannot be regarded as even yet absolutely\r\ndetermined: the prevailing opinion, however, seems to be that it is\r\na fabrication dating from about 1450. It is so entertaining that one\r\nwould wish it trustworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\nGINO CAPPONI, a leading Florentine citizen of the latter fourteenth\r\nand earlier fifteenth century, has left valuable memoirs of some of the\r\ntransactions in which he was engaged. The great Florentine historian\r\nof the age, however, is GIOVANNI VILLANI, a characteristic embodiment\r\nof all the better qualities of his city, who, inspired by ardent\r\npatriotism, wrote its history, including a review of the contemporary\r\ntransactions of the world, from the Tower of Babel to 1346, on the\r\nverge of the Black Death of 1348, by which he was himself carried off.\r\nHis work was continued by his brother Matteo and his nephew Filippo to\r\n1368. Villani possessed every qualification which experience of public\r\nbusiness could afford, having filled several important offices, among\r\nthem those of Prior and Master of the Mint. His language is exceedingly\r\npure, his fidelity and impartiality are beyond suspicion, and he is\r\npeculiarly valuable from his preservation of financial and economical\r\ndetails, and other matters affecting ordinary life. He would have been\r\na model historian if he had lived when the spirit of critical inquiry\r\nwas awake, and historians had learned the delineation of character\r\nand the artistic construction of narrative; he must, however, in this\r\ncase have forfeited the golden simplicity which renders his narrative\r\nso delightful. His nephew Filippo, who lived far into the fifteenth\r\ncentury, wrote in Latin the _Lives of Illustrious Florentines_, already\r\ncited as an authority on Dante. His memoir of Boccaccio has been\r\nfrequently reprinted.\r\n\r\nNo place having hitherto occurred suitable for mention of the _Travels\r\nof Marco Polo_, they, although belonging to the thirteenth century, may\r\nfind mention here. From the purely literary point of view they are of\r\nno great importance, but as the first book that opened the knowledge of\r\nthe East to Europeans, their significance cannot be overrated. Mention\r\nshould also be made of another traveller, CIRIACO DI ANCONA, the first\r\narchæologist, who, in the second quarter of the fifteenth century, set\r\nthe example of collecting inscriptions and works of antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe next prose author whom it is necessary to mention, ENEA SILVIO\r\nPICCOLOMINI, afterwards Pope Pius the Second (1405-64), writing solely\r\nin Latin, has no place in the literary history of the Italian language,\r\nbut is perhaps the most typical example of the fifteenth-century man\r\nof letters, accomplished, versatile, adroit, imperfectly restrained by\r\nprinciple, but inspired by a genuine zeal for culture and humanity. No\r\nliterary personage since Petrarch had displayed such various activity,\r\nor, by his controversial, no less than by his diplomatic ability, had\r\nexerted an equal influence in the affairs of Church and State. Apart\r\nfrom the substantial merits of his writings, Æneas is a typical figure\r\nas indicating that the pen was beginning to govern the world, and that\r\nliterary dexterity could make a Pope of a struggling adventurer. As\r\nan author he has come down to our day by his Commentaries of his own\r\ntimes, one of that valuable class of histories whose authors can say,\r\n“Pars magna fui”; and by his _Euryalus and Lucretia_, a romance founded\r\non an actual occurrence, and noteworthy as a precursor of the modern\r\nnovel.\r\n\r\nIn LEONE BATTISTA ALBERTI (1404-72) we at length encounter a humanist\r\naccomplished alike in the learned and the vulgar tongue; while, like\r\nLeonardo da Vinci, to whom he offers a strong resemblance, less\r\nremarkable for any particular work than for the universality of his\r\ngenius. An architect and mathematician, an engineer and the inventor\r\nof the camera obscura, he was almost the first of the moderns to treat\r\nthese subjects scientifically, and extended his researches to painting\r\nand sculpture. His literary celebrity, however, arises rather from his\r\ntreatise _Della Famiglia_, a model of practical wisdom, couched in the\r\nclear and cheerful spirit of a Goethe, and affording a pleasing insight\r\ninto the Italian family life of the period, as yet unspoiled by luxury.\r\n“What he says about the beauty of the body is worthy of a Greek, what\r\nhe says about exercise might have been written by an Englishman”\r\n(Symonds). The third book, superior to the others in diction, has been\r\nattributed to Agnolo Pandolfini, a distinguished Florentine statesman\r\nof an earlier date, but Alberti’s claim to it seems satisfactorily\r\nestablished. His _Iciarchia_, a treatise on the ideal prince, is\r\nalso a remarkable work; and his novelette, _Ippolito and Leonora_,\r\nfounded on a Florentine tradition, is distinguished by pathos and\r\nsimplicity. Alberti was the natural son of a Florentine exile, and\r\nwas born at Genoa. His early years were years of hardship. Restored\r\nto his ancestral city, he there executed important architectural and\r\nengineering works, and subsequently metamorphosed into a splendid\r\ntemple the old church at Rimini, which Sigismondo Malatesta dedicated\r\nin its altered form to the memory of his mistress Isotta. He was\r\nafterwards abbreviator of Papal briefs at Rome. Deprived of this\r\noffice, along with sixty-nine other eminent scholars, by the Philistine\r\nbut practical Pope Paul II., he devoted himself to architecture at\r\nFlorence and Mantua, and died at Rome in 1472.\r\n\r\nThe excellent VESPASIANO DA BISTICCI (1421-98), almost alone among\r\nhis literary contemporaries, followed a trade, being a bookseller at\r\nFlorence. He formed the great library of the first Duke of Urbino, and\r\nhas left particulars of his zeal in the preparation of illuminated\r\nmanuscripts, and a vigorous expression of his disesteem for printed\r\nbooks in comparison with them. We are indebted to him for no fewer than\r\n105 biographies of contemporaries, most of whom were personally known\r\nto him. A few, of considerable length and elaboration, record the lives\r\nof popes, kings, and cardinals; the great majority are brief and simple\r\nnotices of scholars and literary men, some of whom, but for Bisticci,\r\nwould be almost unknown. All are charming from their unaffected\r\nsimplicity and geniality, and the curious traits of the age which they\r\npreserve.\r\n\r\nHad GIOVANNI PONTANO (1426-1503) written in the vernacular, he\r\nwould have won a place equal to any contemporary’s as a poet, and\r\na place among prose-writers entirely his own. Though a statesman\r\nand diplomatist, the confidant of the King of Naples, a philologist\r\nbeside, and the life and soul of the Neapolitan Academy, he is none\r\nthe less the Lucian and the Martial of his age; the lively satirist\r\nand delineator of popular manners in his dialogues; in his verse a\r\ngenuine lyrist, careful of form as a Greek, animated and eager as if\r\nhe had been a born Neapolitan. His prose and verse palpitate with\r\nfeeling, and he gains life at the expense of Latinity. His historical\r\nwritings, though respectable, are of less mark; but as a popular poet\r\nand satirist, Italian speech had an infinite loss in him. Even as it\r\nis, he seems but one remove from a vernacular author. His dialogues had\r\nprobably much influence upon Erasmus. Another contemporary figure is\r\nstrange and enigmatical. We know but imperfectly who FRANCESCO COLONNA,\r\nthe author of the _Hypnerotomachia Poliphili_, was, and can only guess\r\nwhy he composed his visionary romance in a macaronic jargon neither\r\nLatin nor Italian. The book describes a vision in which Polifilo, after\r\nviewing magnificent processions and going through various adventures,\r\nultimately obtains the hand of his lady, Polia, who has been identified\r\nwith Lucrezia Lello, daughter of a jurisconsult at Treviso. It is\r\nbarely readable, and yet its very inarticulateness gives it a charm\r\nwhich it would not have possessed if the author had been another\r\nBoccaccio. The soul of the Renaissance seems to have passed into it,\r\nand to be dumbly yearning for a manifestation never found, “moving\r\napart in worlds not realised.” The impression is greatly assisted by\r\nthe unique illustrations to which it owes its preciousness in artistic\r\neyes, and whose origin is still an unsolved problem. Their lavish fancy\r\nand skill in rendering every variety of expression by mere outline\r\nare apparent to all; but behind these technical qualities lies the\r\nsuggestion of a romantic and far-away world, comparable to the Hades\r\nadumbrated in the tender farewells on Greek sepulchral reliefs.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the literary harvest of the century following the death\r\nof Petrarch was poor, and the seed dispersed by him and Boccaccio\r\nseemed to have fallen upon barren ground. It was not, however, entirely\r\nthus: some of the Latin poets, such as Baptista Mantuanus, Campanus,\r\nAugurellus, whom we have been compelled to pass without special notice,\r\nmight have won durable renown if they had written in Italian; and\r\nthough there is little achievement in vernacular literature, several\r\nbranches of human activity are for the first time in modern Europe\r\nbrought under literary influence. The dearth of literary genius was\r\nparalleled by an equal paucity of statesmen and warriors of real\r\ngreatness, though a Ziska or a Sforza appears here and there. Some\r\nmysterious cause had depressed the intellectual vitality of the age,\r\nwhich, nevertheless, continued to progress in social refinement and\r\nin opulence. Its æsthetic sensitiveness was chiefly expressed in the\r\nrapid development of pictorial and plastic art, and the renovation\r\nof architecture; its literary ideal was mainly manifested by the\r\nphilological and critical apostles of the Renaissance, a remarkable\r\nband, who must find place in another chapter. As was to be expected\r\nunder such circumstances, one of the features of the time was the\r\nimprovement of the old universities and the formation of private\r\nsocieties of scholars, which expressed Italian intellectual needs as\r\nclearly as the foundation of the Royal Society expressed English needs\r\nat a later elate. Two achieved special celebrity--the Roman Academy,\r\npersecuted by Pope Paul II. for its relapse into paganism, and the\r\nPlatonic Academy at Florence, cherished by the Medici. It fell to the\r\nlot of the latter to solemnly decide, under the auspices of Lorenzo\r\nde’ Medici, that the Italian language actually was on a par with the\r\nLatin, and that a man of wit or learning need not fear to lose caste by\r\nwriting in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] Many will be found in a collection unfortunately published on too\r\nlimited a scale to be generally accessible, Daelli’s _Biblioteca Rara_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n           THE POETICAL RENAISSANCE OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn characterising the original authors, apart from critics and\r\ncommentators, whom Italy produced during the first half of the\r\nfifteenth century, we have omitted the men who really exerted the\r\nmost important influence upon literature. These form a group by\r\nthemselves--not one of Italian authors, for they rarely wrote in the\r\nvernacular; scarcely one of authors at all, for they worked chiefly\r\nas philologers. They are, however, much too important to be passed\r\nover without notice, representing as they did the Renaissance in its\r\naspect as the rebirth of free thought and inquiry, a resurrection no\r\nless momentous than the revival of art and letters, and preparing\r\nthe literary development which they were unable to effect. Few of\r\nthem were men of extraordinary mental power, but all were passionate\r\nfor the study of antiquity, and while, perhaps, intending to restore\r\nLatin to its rank as the sole literary language, set forces at work\r\nwhich deprived it of this primacy for ever. Even though Lorenzo de’\r\nMedici might apologise for writing in a language condemned by men of\r\ngood judgment, and Varchi’s schoolmaster might punish him for reading\r\nPetrarch, when men like Alberti took to cultivating the vernacular\r\nspeech in emulation of the Latin, it was clear that the latter had\r\nalready lost its monopoly.\r\n\r\nThe humanists had nevertheless in their own domain the great\r\nadvantage of being first in the field. They could hardly advance\r\nin any direction without initiating some movement momentous in its\r\neffect upon culture. Emanuel Chrysoloras brought the Greek language\r\nto Florence; his son-in-law, Filelfo, voyaged to Constantinople, and\r\nreturned with a Greek library. Poggio Bracciolini, a most elegant\r\nLatinist and epistolographer--unfortunately best remembered by his\r\nvirulent invectives, and by a book of facetiæ which does more credit\r\nto his gaiety than to his morals--rendered the greatest service by his\r\nassiduity in the collection of manuscripts. Leonardo Bruni accomplished\r\neven more by the simple step of making accurate translations of Plato\r\nand Aristotle, and thus delivering Western science from bondage to\r\nthe Arabians, through whose paraphrases these writings had hitherto\r\nbeen chiefly known. Lorenzo Valla, an acute and intrepid critic and\r\noriginal thinker, enthusiastic for truth in the abstract, but not\r\ngenerally actuated by high principle, became the father of modern\r\nnegative criticism by his overthrow of the scandalous Papal imposture\r\nof the Donation of Constantine. Gemistus Pletho, though a visionary,\r\nintroduced Plato to Italy, and powerfully stimulated thought through\r\nthe controversies aroused by his writings. Flavio Biondo was the\r\nfirst scientific archæologist, describing the monuments of pagan and\r\nChristian Rome, and investigating the topography of ancient Italy.\r\nVittorino da Feltre showed practically by his school at Mantua what\r\neducation ought to be, and Vespasiano da Bisticci wrote the lives of\r\nhis fellows. Even men like Filelfo, whose restless pens produced no\r\nwork of real importance, kept the intellectual life alert by their\r\nincessant activity. For the time the age found what it needed in\r\nsuch men, and scholars enjoyed the consideration awarded to poets\r\nunder Augustus, rhetoricians in the later Roman Empire, jurists under\r\nJustinian, and the founders of religious orders in the days of St.\r\nDominic and St. Francis.\r\n\r\nThe deference shown to scholars is sufficiently attested by the\r\nhonourable offices conferred upon them, the competition of princes\r\nand republics to obtain the most distinguished Latinists for their\r\nsecretaries, and the throngs that attended their lectures and other\r\npublic displays, vapid and empty as these frequently appear to us. The\r\nprevailing current of taste proved highly advantageous in raising the\r\nstandard of university education. Bologna, in a former age the herald\r\nof Italian academic culture, latterly in a condition of decay, revived\r\nand asserted her supremacy, and her sister seats of learning competed\r\nvigorously with her and each other. The triumph of humanism seemed\r\ncomplete when in 1447 erudition made a Pope in the person of Nicholas\r\nV., the founder of the Vatican Library, whose love of erudition was\r\nsuch that it absolved in his eyes even Lorenzo Valla’s exposure of\r\npious frauds. Two great events favourable to culture succeeded--the\r\nfall of Constantinople, which brought a fresh flight of learned Greeks\r\ninto Europe; and the invention of printing, of which, however, Italy\r\ndid not reap the benefit until 1464. The tardiness of so simple an\r\ninvention, upon the verge of which antiquity had continually been\r\nhovering, is one of the most surprising facts in the history of the\r\nhuman mind; the indifference with which it was at first received\r\nis hardly less so; and the stimulus it imparted to literature long\r\nfell below reasonable expectation. It is remarkable, however, that\r\ntwo complete versions of the Bible appeared at Venice in 1471, and\r\nsignificant that no vernacular Bible was allowed to be printed anywhere\r\nelse. The general character of the productions of the Italian press\r\nis distinctly academical and utilitarian. Classics and classical\r\ncommentaries, theology, canon and civil law, medicine, form the staple;\r\nimaginative vernacular literature, even of the past, is scanty;\r\ncontemporary literature might hardly have existed so far as the early\r\nrecords of the press indicate. Apart from the studies which conduced\r\nto a livelihood, the period all over Europe was one of intellectual\r\nbarrenness. But young men of lively genius were growing up, and one of\r\nthese was in a position to be as serviceable to modern belles-lettres\r\nas Nicholas V. had been to the study of antiquity.\r\n\r\nIt rarely happens that Augustus is also Virgil; enough if he is also\r\nMæcenas. LORENZO DE’ MEDICI (1448-92) united all these characters.\r\nA prince by position if not by descent, he was not only a patron\r\nof literature, but a highly intelligent and discriminating patron;\r\nnor only a favourer, but himself the producer of some of the best\r\nliterature of his day. In character, in circumstances, in the bent\r\nof his policy and the general result of his activity, he might not\r\nunfairly be termed a miniature Augustus; like him he confiscated the\r\nliberties of his country as the sole alternative to anarchy, and repaid\r\nher by prosperity and peace. All the great qualities of Augustus\r\nwere his, and few of the defects which history chiefly censures in\r\nhis prototype. Both were stronger in the self-regarding than in the\r\nself-forgetting virtues, but Lorenzo once rose to heroism. History\r\nrecords no action of Augustus comparable to Lorenzo’s placing himself\r\nin the power of the treacherous and unscrupulous King of Naples for\r\nthe sake of his country. Nor had Lorenzo, like Augustus, ever occasion\r\nto pass the sponge over an abortive tragedy. His compositions are of\r\ndifferent degrees of merit, but all are fluent and graceful.\r\n\r\nWe have entered a different period from that of the Uberti and Frezzi;\r\nthe tree of poetry, so long stiff and dry, now swells with sap, and\r\nbuds with the prophecy of a coming summer. Two distinct impulses are\r\nobservable in Lorenzo and his literary mate, Politian: in one point\r\nof view the artistic, in the other the poetical spirit predominates.\r\nAs artists, they strove successfully to attain perfect elegance of\r\nexpression, and to improve the metrical forms which had descended\r\nfrom the fourteenth century. As poets, they seized upon the songs and\r\ncatches current in the mouths of the people, and elevated them by\r\njudicious treatment into the region of art. This could be possible only\r\nto men of great poetic sensitiveness. Had Lorenzo and Politian been\r\nless refined by culture, had the one been no scholar and the other no\r\nprince, either might have been an Italian Burns; as it is, their work\r\nas lyric poets is more nearly comparable to Goethe’s. They made the\r\npopular Muse acceptable to men of breeding, while gratifying their own\r\ntastes by work marked with the stamp of study and erudition, and yet\r\nnot beyond the intelligence of the average educated man.\r\n\r\nLorenzo’s part as the patron of art and letters is so considerable,\r\nthat his writings, important as they are, appear almost insignificant\r\nin comparison. The most elaborate of his poems might be classed as\r\nidylls. They comprise the _Ambra_, a graceful and fanciful Ovidian\r\nallegory on the metamorphosis of the nymph Ambra into a rock to\r\nescape the pursuit of a river-god; _La Caccia col Falcone_, a\r\nlively description of this aristocratic sport; and _La Nencia di\r\nBarberino_, no less vivid in its portraiture of the humours of plebeian\r\nlove-making. Lorenzo’s own love poetry consists chiefly of canzoni,\r\nmore remarkable for elegance than depth of feeling, but perfectly in\r\nthe character of a man of pleasure who is also a refined gentleman. The\r\nspirituality of Dante and his contemporaries, the romantic passion of\r\nPetrarch, no longer suited the age. The temple of Love, like the temple\r\nof the Church, had been secularised; in everything men habitually lived\r\nat a lower level. Yet this declension is compensated in a great degree\r\nby the enhanced feeling of reality: there can be no such controversy\r\nover Lorenzo’s innamorata as over Beatrice and Laura. The following is\r\na fair example of his erotic style:\r\n\r\n      _Thy beauty, gentle Violet, was born\r\n        Where for the look of Love I first was fain,\r\n        And my bright stream of bitter tears was rain\r\n      That beauty to accomplish and adorn.\r\n      And such desire was from compassion born,\r\n        That from the happy nook where thou wert lain\r\n        The fair hand gathered thee, and not in vain,\r\n      For by my own it willed thee to be borne.\r\n      And, as to me appears, thou wouldst return\r\n        Once more to that fair hand, whence thee upon\r\n        My naked breast I have securely set:\r\n      The naked breast that doth desire and burn,\r\n        And holds thee in her heart’s place, that hath gone\r\n        To dwell where thou wert late, my Violet._\r\n\r\nIf there is more gallantry than passion in compositions of this\r\nnature, they show at least that the lute of Love had received a new\r\nstring since the time of the troubadours.\r\n\r\nLove of a sensuous kind is a chief ingredient in Lorenzo’s _Canti\r\nCarnascialeschi_, which are sometimes highly licentious. He is accused\r\nof having composed them with a special view of diverting the minds of\r\nthe young Florentines from politics; but it seems unnecessary to go\r\nbeyond the temptation to licence afforded by the general relaxation\r\nof the carnival. The gay and the serious Lorenzo were very different\r\npeople, as remarked by that acute observer Machiavelli. His epistle\r\nto his own son Giovanni, afterwards Leo X., on his elevation to the\r\nCardinalate at fourteen, is a model of wisdom and right feeling. His\r\nspiritual poems, _Laudi_, moreover, frequently speak the language of\r\ntrue religious emotion.\r\n\r\nLorenzo’s court, as is universally known, was the chosen abode of\r\nartists and men of letters. A twin star with Lorenzo himself, but\r\neven brighter in his literary aspect was ANGELO AMBROGINI (1454-92),\r\nknown as POLIZIANO from his birth at Montepulciano. Politian, the most\r\nbrilliant classical scholar of his age, was perhaps the first professed\r\nphilologist whose scholarship was entirely divested of pedantry.\r\nWith him classical studies were a vivifying influence, pervading and\r\nadorning his literary exercises in the vernacular, but implying no\r\ndisparagement of the latter. There is little to choose between his\r\nLatin and his Italian poetry: the same poetic spirit inspires both,\r\nand each is an exemplar of the charm of a choice, yet not too ornate\r\ndiction. He was accused of writing his Latin verses “with more heat\r\nthan art”; but this is only another way of saying that while composing\r\nthem he felt as an ancient, and might very well be taken for a poet of\r\nthe Silver Age. His lyric tragedy or opera, _Orfeo_, will be treated\r\nalong with the Italian drama, of which it was the first meritorious\r\nexample. His _Giostra_, a poem on the tournament exhibited by Lorenzo’s\r\nbrother Giuliano in 1475, and incidentally introducing its hero’s\r\npassion for the lovely Simonetta, remained unfinished in consequence\r\nof Giuliano’s untimely death. It is full of beauties, and is memorable\r\nin Italian poetry as the first example of the thoroughly successful\r\nemployment of the octave stanza. Boccaccio had been too diffuse;\r\nbut Politian exemplified the perfect fitness of this form for the\r\ncombination of narrative poetry with an inexhaustible succession of\r\nverbal felicities, many of which, indeed, are appropriated from earlier\r\npoets, but all, old and new, seem fused into a glowing whole by the\r\npassion for classic form and sensuous beauty. But Politian and his\r\nsuccessors did not emulate the classical poets’ accurate delineation of\r\nNature. The materials of their descriptions are drawn from storehouses\r\nto which every scholar has a key. They bespeak reading and memory\r\nrather than actual observation.\r\n\r\nThis, in Miss Ellen Clerke’s version, is Politian’s rendering of\r\nthe vision of perpetual Spring, first seen by Homer, after him by\r\nLucretius, and in our time by Tennyson. Like Ariosto and Tasso, he\r\nplaces his enchanted garden on earth.\r\n\r\n      _A fair hill doth the Cyprian breezes woo,\r\n      And sevenfold stream of mighty Nilus see,\r\n      When the horizon reddeneth anew;\r\n      But mortal foot may not there planted be.\r\n      A green knoll on its slope doth rise to view,\r\n      A sunny meadow sheltering in its lee,\r\n      Where, wantoning 'mid flowers, each gale that passes\r\n      Sets lightly quivering the verdant grasses._\r\n\r\n      _A wall of gold its furthest edge doth screen,\r\n      Where lies a vale with shady trees set fair,\r\n      Upon whose branches, 'mid leaves newly green,\r\n      The quiring birds chant love songs on the air.\r\n      The grateful sound of waters chimes between,\r\n      By twin streams cool and lucid shed forth there,\r\n      In the wave sweet and bitter of whose river\r\n      Love whets the golden arrows of his quiver._\r\n\r\n      _Nor the perennial garden’s foliage green\r\n      Doth snow new-fallen blanch, or rime-frost hoar.\r\n      No vernal blight dare come these walls between.\r\n      No gale the grass and shrubs e’er ruffles o’er.\r\n      Nor is the year in fourfold season seen;\r\n      But joyous Spring here reigns for evermore,\r\n      Shakes to the breeze her blonde and rippling tresses,\r\n      And weaves her wreath of flowers as on she presses._\r\n\r\nIn Politian’s own eyes and those of his contemporaries his achievement\r\nas a poet was less important than his labour as a classical scholar.\r\nNor, as respected the needs and interests of his contemporaries, was\r\nthis judgment wholly mistaken. “Knowledge in that age,” says Symonds,\r\n“was the pearl of great price; not the knowledge of righteousness,\r\nnot the knowledge of Nature and her laws, but the knowledge of the\r\nwonderful life which throbbed in ancient peoples, and which might\r\nmake this old world young again.” Politian’s chief merits as a\r\nclassical scholar were to have known how to excite a living interest\r\nin antiquity, and to have been the first to attempt a scientific\r\nclassification of MSS. His translations from the Greek were admirable.\r\nSo long as Lorenzo presided over Florence, Politian’s lot, though\r\nembittered by some violent literary controversies, had been brilliant\r\nand prosperous: his patron’s death exposed him to the general\r\nunpopularity of the supporters of Lorenzo’s incapable successor, the\r\nFrench invader stood at the doors, Savonarola’s followers began to\r\nassail culture in its representatives, and within little more than two\r\nyears Politian escaped the gathering storm either by a broken heart or\r\na voluntary death.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate Politian’s services in imparting literary form to popular\r\npoetry, it will be necessary to bestow a glance on this poetry as it\r\nexisted in Tuscany in his day, and in a measure exists still. We have\r\npreviously remarked upon the absence of national ballad poetry at a\r\nvery early period; and when at length we find traces of popular song,\r\nlittle resembling _Chevy Chase_ is to be discovered, the staple being\r\ncarols and love catches. Some of these may be as old as the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and the mass continued augmenting as one anonymous singer\r\nafter another added something sufficiently attractive to be propagated\r\nfrom hamlet to hamlet, and treasured in the memory.\r\n\r\nSimilar lyrical production went on over most parts of Italy; the\r\nSicilian songs, after the Tuscan, being the most numerous, or at least\r\nthe best preserved. These ditties fall generally into two divisions,\r\n_rispetti_ and _stornelli_: the former consisting of four or six\r\nverses rhyming alternately, followed by a couplet; the latter of three\r\nlines only, the last rhyming with the first. These soon developed\r\ninto the _madrigal_, a form affected by persons of culture and\r\nprofessional musicians, but the people continued to carol as of old.\r\nThus, spontaneous births of the instinct for love and song, undergoing\r\ncountless modifications in passing from mouth to mouth, until the right\r\nform has been found at last, and sifted by the taste of generation\r\nafter generation, these little songs have formed a really beautiful\r\ncollection of verse, reflecting in their ardour, graceful fancy and\r\npurity of sentiment, the best characteristics of the race from which\r\nthey sprung. How good they are may be seen from a few of the specimens\r\nso admirably rendered by John Addington Symonds:[10]--\r\n\r\n      _The moon has risen her plaint to lay\r\n      Before the face of Love Divine;\r\n      Saying in heaven she will not stay,\r\n      Since you have stolen what made her shine.\r\n      Aloud she wails with sorrow wan;--\r\n      She told her stars, and two are gone:\r\n      They are not there; ye have them now;\r\n      They are the eyes in your bright brow._\r\n\r\n      _Think it no grief that I am brown;\r\n      For all brunettes are born to reign:\r\n      White is the snow, yet trodden down;\r\n      Black pepper, kings do not disdain:\r\n      White snow lies mounded in the vales;\r\n      Black pepper’s weighed in brazen scales._\r\n\r\n      _O Swallow, Swallow, flying through the air,\r\n      Turn, turn, I prithee, from thy flight above.\r\n      Give me one feather from thy wing so fair,\r\n      For I will write a letter to my love.\r\n      When I have written it and made it clear,\r\n      I’ll give thee back thy feather, Swallow dear;\r\n      When I have written it on paper white,\r\n      I’ll make, I swear, thy missing feather right;\r\n      When once ’tis written on fair leaves of gold,\r\n      I’ll give thee back thy wings and flight so bold._\r\n\r\nTwo other leading poetical figures of the fifteenth century, Matteo\r\nMaria Boiardo and Luigi Pulci, authors of the _Orlando Innamorato_ and\r\nthe _Morgante Maggiore_, will be best treated along with the writers of\r\nchivalrous romance in epic form. It is not quite clear how far Pulci\r\nhad a share in the poems ascribed to his elder brother Luca (1431-70);\r\nbut the latter’s verses on Giuliano de’ Medici, his crusading epic,\r\n_Ciriffo Calvaneo_, and his pastoral, _Driadeo_, undoubtedly owe much\r\nto Luigi. The heroic epistles in verse which pass under his name are\r\nno doubt by him. Another poet, GIROLAMO BENIVIENI, shines amid the\r\nPlatonic circle of Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola. His verses\r\nmight have given him no inconsiderable distinction if he could have\r\nattained to lucidity of diction; but his powers of expression are\r\ninadequate to the abstruseness of his themes. He does best when his\r\nidealism is embodied in an objective shape, as in the following sonnet,\r\nclearly suggested by the first in the _Vita Nuova_:\r\n\r\n      _In utmost height of Heaven I saw the choir\r\n        Of happy stars in their infinity\r\n        Attending on the Sun obediently,\r\n      And he was pasturing them with his own fire.\r\n      And, wealthy with my spoil, I saw Desire\r\n        Unstring his bow and lay his arrows by,\r\n        And proffer Heaven, with all humility,\r\n      My heart, which golden drapery did attire.\r\n      And, of this disarrayed, not half so fair\r\n        Smiles Earth to Sun when by his crescent light\r\n        The ivory horn of vernal Bull is smit\r\n      As in this glory did my heart appear,\r\n        Which now my mortal breast doth scorn and slight,\r\n        Abandoning, nor will return to it._\r\n\r\nThe Italian writings of Benivieni’s friend Savonarola are chiefly\r\ntheological. Their fervour gained them great influence at the time,\r\nbut the celebrity which they still enjoy is due rather to the fame of\r\nthe writer than to their literary qualities. Savonarola nevertheless\r\naffected the literature of his day, partly by his war against classical\r\nand Renaissance culture, and partly by the impulse which he gave to\r\nthe pamphlet, precursor of the newspaper press. Cristoforo Landino’s\r\nCamaldolese Dialogues would have been important contributions lo the\r\nnational literature if they had been written in Italian.\r\n\r\nThe first writer of prose who presents us with a perfect example from\r\nwhich the new period may be dated is JACOPO SANNAZARO, as much\r\nas Politian the nursling of a court; to whom we are also indebted for\r\nthe first example of the pastoral romance, and the first proof that\r\nexcellent Italian prose could be written outside Tuscany. Sannazaro,\r\nborn in 1458, was a Neapolitan of Spanish descent, as it is said, and\r\nthe statement seems to be corroborated by the peculiar independence and\r\ndignity of character which distinguish him from the supple literati of\r\nhis time. Even Pontano, whose obligations to the royal house of Naples\r\nwere so extreme, played an ambiguous part upon the ephemeral French\r\nconquest of 1495. Sannazaro’s loyalty not only sustained that brief\r\nordeal, but when four years later the cause of the Neapolitan dynasty\r\nwas irrevocably lost, he accompanied his fallen master to France, and\r\nspent several years in exile. Returning to Naples, he inhabited a\r\nbeautiful villa at Mergellina, and devoted himself to the poetry of\r\nwhich we shall have to speak in another place. After witnessing the\r\ndestruction of his retreat in the French war (1528), he died in 1530\r\nin the house of Cassandra, Marchesa Castriota, whom he had vainly\r\ndefended against her husband’s attempt to repudiate her. Few of his\r\ncontemporaries deserve equal respect as a man; and although as a\r\nwriter but of the second rank, it was granted to him, alike in prose\r\nand verse, to mark an era in literature signalising the triumph of\r\nPetrarch and Boccaccio over the pedantry of the fifteenth century, but\r\nat the same time the deliberate preference of form to matter, and the\r\ndiscouragement of irregular originality.\r\n\r\nSannazaro’s _Arcadia_, historically the most important of his\r\nwritings, is comparatively a youthful performance, having been\r\nsubstantially completed by 1489, though not published in a correct\r\nedition until 1504. It would in any case mark an epoch as the\r\nfirst perfect example of the pastoral romance, which Boccaccio had\r\nforeshadowed in his _Ameto_, but which Sannazaro enriched by elements\r\nderived from Theocritus and Virgil. His landscape and personages are\r\nentirely classical; the shepherds contend with each other in song\r\nprecisely as in the Greek and Latin eclogues, and no attempt is made\r\nto represent rustic manners as they really are. The descriptions,\r\nwhether of nature or of humanity, on the other hand, are graceful\r\nand vivid, and informed by a most poetical sentiment; and it may be\r\nsaid that Sannazaro’s work would be more esteemed at this day if it\r\nhad had fewer imitators. The style admits of but little variety, and\r\npastoral fiction easily became insipid in the hands of a succession\r\nof followers who did not, like Shakespeare in the _Winter’s Tale_,\r\nresort to Nature for their delineations. Sannazaro himself is not\r\nexempt from the charge of monotony. More serious defects, however, are\r\nthose of excessive Latinisation in the construction of sentences, and\r\nrhetorical exaggeration, arising from his too close adherence to the\r\nimmature style of Boccaccio’s early writings, instead of the simple\r\nelegance of the _Decameron_. The resolution to achieve poetry in prose\r\nat any cost, causes a crabbed involution and overloads the diction with\r\nadjectives; while there is yet enough of true feeling to overcome even\r\nthe wearisomeness of the perpetual laments of the shepherds over the\r\nunparalleled cruelty of their innamoratas. Sannazaro had a mistress\r\nto whose memory he remained faithful all his life, and most of his\r\nfictitious characters veil actual personages. When this is understood,\r\nthe romance loses its apparent artificiality; and Settembrini’s remark\r\nis justified, “_Anche oggi si sente una dolcezza d’ affetto a leggere\r\nquel libro_.”\r\n\r\nThe main literary interest, however, of the _Arcadia_ is that it marks\r\nan epoch and carries the reform which Lorenzo de’ Medici and Politian\r\nhad initiated in verse into the domain of prose. It is perhaps the sole\r\nItalian prose composition of the fifteenth century which can be said\r\nto wear a classic stamp; and being received with enthusiasm and read\r\nby all, it fixed a standard which subsequent writers were compelled to\r\nmaintain. It prescribed the rule for pastoral romance in all languages:\r\nnot only did Sidney borrow its spirit and many of its episodes as well\r\nas its name for his own work, more, however, of a romance and less of\r\na pastoral than Sannazaro’s; not only did the two great Portuguese\r\npastoralists, Bernardim Ribeiro and Montemayor, model themselves upon\r\nit; but Shakespeare took from it the name of Ophelia, and traces of it\r\nmay be found, not only in the pastoral part of Keats’s _Endymion_, but\r\neven in his _Hyperion_.\r\n\r\nBy Sannazaro’s time, then, it may be said that Italian literature\r\nwas fairly despatched on the route which it was to follow throughout\r\nthe golden Cinque Cento. Elegance, finish, polish were to be the\r\nchief aims; form was to be esteemed at least on a par with matter;\r\nthe mediæval elements, as we find them in Dante, were to be kept in\r\nabeyance. The classical tradition was to be taken up, and Italy was\r\nto appear as the literary heiress of Rome; but not to the extent of\r\ncorrupting her own language with Latinisms. Such a tacit resolution\r\nwas admirable for raising and maintaining the standard of literary\r\ncomposition, but was hostile to the development of transcendent genius.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] The best collection of popular Italian belletristic literature is\r\nthe _Canti e Racconti del Popolo Italiano_, in eight volumes, edited by\r\nE. Comparetti and A. D’Ancona.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n                           CHIVALRIC POETRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the Italian chivalric epic is one of the most\r\ninteresting departments of the story of literature, both on its own\r\naccount, and because it reveals as in a mirror the growth of the more\r\nimportant epic of the tale of Troy. It arose out of a real event of the\r\ndeepest importance to Europe, but this it so disfigured by romance and\r\nimagination as to be hardly recognisable. Charles Martel, the deliverer\r\nof France from the Saracens, is confounded with another and still more\r\nillustrious Charles, whose relations with the Saracen monarchs were\r\nusually amicable; and, by what seems to be a universal law, this hero\r\ncomes to occupy but a corner of the temple nominally dedicated to\r\nhim, and his renown is transferred to creatures of pure imagination.\r\nAs Agamemnon, who at all events personifies the most powerful state\r\nof primitive Greece, yields as a poetic hero to such historically\r\nsubordinate, if not absolutely fictitious personages as Achilles and\r\nUlysses; as the terrible Attila, the portent of his time, shrinks in\r\nthe Nibelungen Lied into the insignificant figure of Etzel; so, in the\r\nromancer’s eye, the real glories of Charlemagne dwindle to nothing\r\nbefore the petty skirmish of Roncesvalles.\r\n\r\nIn all these instances, and equally so in the cycle of Arthur, a\r\ngerm of historical reality lies latent in the human consciousness\r\nfor centuries, and then suddenly becomes prolific of a wealth of\r\nimaginative detail. There can be no reasonable doubt that the writers\r\nof the Homeric epics, whether few or many, stood in the same relation\r\nto their sources as Malory and Boiardo to theirs, inheritors of a\r\ntradition in which they reposed genuine belief, but which at the same\r\ntime they thought themselves at liberty to embellish and diversify as\r\nthey deemed best. We should probably find the resemblance between the\r\ndevelopment of Trojan and of Arthurian legend to be very close, had we\r\nthe same acquaintance with the intellectual history of ancient Greece\r\nas we possess with that of the mediæval period. Both were the result of\r\na great poetical revival, when the awakening spirit grasped eagerly at\r\nthe nutriment nearest to hand; and the Celtic romancers of the twelfth\r\ncentury were inspired by true Celtic yearnings for an irrevocable past,\r\nfinding much of their material in the national historian, Geoffrey of\r\nMonmouth.\r\n\r\nWith the Italian romantic epic the case was somewhat different: it\r\nwas largely influenced by a single book, and one composed with a\r\ndirect polemical purpose. The fear and hatred entertained in the tenth\r\nand eleventh centuries for the Saracen invaders and the Danes, and\r\nother heathens frequently confounded with them, found expression at\r\nlast in a remarkable book, the Latin Chronicles attributed to Turpin,\r\nArchbishop of Rheims in the eighth century, but really a fabrication\r\nof the eleventh, in which Charlemagne and his paladins were idealised\r\nas the vanquishers of the pagans. From the prominent position given\r\nto Charlemagne’s imaginary Spanish expeditions, the author is thought\r\nto have been a Spaniard, and he owed much to that “Iliad of the\r\nMiddle Ages,” the _Song of Roland_, also a production of the eleventh\r\ncentury. The panic passed away, but left behind it a rich deposit of\r\nromantic fiction, deriving a beauty unknown to former ages from the\r\nhigh estimate of woman which Christianity and Teutonic feeling had\r\njointly contributed to the collective human consciousness. Utilised in\r\nmany French narrative poems, this chivalric element first appeared in\r\nItalian in the elaborate prose-romance, _I Reali di Francia_. From this\r\nthe step to metrical epic was easy, but the awkwardness of the Italian\r\npoets’ first attempts seems to indicate that it was not taken until\r\nthe poetic art had reached its period of deepest depression in the\r\nearly part of the fifteenth century, when the rude and tedious epics\r\n_Buovo di Antona_ (Bevis of Hampton), _La Spagna_, _Febus_, and _Queen\r\nAncronja_ were probably composed.\r\n\r\nAnother epic of the same period, without a name, recently discovered,\r\nis to a considerable extent the groundwork of the _Morgante\r\nMaggiore_[11] of LUIGI PULCI (1432-87), a humorous poem with a\r\nserious purpose, or, at least, unconsciously expressing some of the\r\nmost serious phenomena of the age. Its mixture of sincere religious\r\nfeeling and genuine humanity with the most irreverent buffoonery\r\nhas made it the stumbling-block of critics and literary historians,\r\nwhose interpretation of its tendencies and estimate of its author’s\r\ncharacter are usually determined by their own prepossessions. While it\r\nis impossible to deny that Morgante’s companion, the epicurean gourmand\r\nMargutte,[12] is the author’s special creation, and the object of his\r\nchief predilection among his characters, other portions of the poem\r\nare couched in so lofty a strain, that he has been supposed to have\r\nhad assistance from no less a philosopher than Ficino and no less a\r\npoet than Politian. Sarcastic sallies at the expense of the popular\r\ntheology alternate with set passages of fervent orthodoxy. To us the\r\n_Morgante_ appears a symbol of the intellectual anarchy then prevalent\r\namong the most intelligent Italians, among whom the religious sentiment\r\nsurvived, while its external vesture had become mere mythology; who\r\nhad neither, like Benivieni, fallen under the influence of Savonarola,\r\nnor were disqualified by lack of classical culture from participating\r\nin the humanistic revival. Pulci’s opinions are probably expressed by\r\nAstaroth, a devil introduced to aid the paladins and talk divinity, and\r\nwhose discourse contains a marvellous foreshadowing of the discovery of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can, nevertheless, be no question that the frivolous and mocking\r\nelement in the _Morgante_ is the source of its celebrity and literary\r\nimportance. It is the first really great modern example of burlesque\r\npoetry, and there are few literatures without traces of its influence.\r\nIn our own, it was the father of Frere’s _Whistlecraft_, which was the\r\nfather of _Beppo_ and the _Vision of Judgment_, the first stanza of\r\nwhich latter poem inverts an idea of Pulci’s; and Byron accompanied\r\nthese masterpieces by a translation of Pulci’s first canto, upon which\r\nhe himself set a special value. It has been contended that Shakespeare\r\nwas acquainted with Pulci, and certainly Panizzi’s portrait of the\r\nvindictive traitor Gano in the _Morgante_ might almost serve for one\r\nof Iago, while Orlando’s unsuspecting magnanimity resembles Othello’s.\r\nPanizzi justly praises the truth and dignity of the characters of\r\nOrlando and Rinaldo, and says of the general economy of the poem:\r\n“Pulci was the first who wrote a long and complicated poem which,\r\ndiversified as it is by many incidents, has a principal subject and a\r\nprincipal character, on which all other parts and personages depend,\r\nwithout which the poem could not subsist, and which by itself alone\r\nforms an uninterrupted narrative. This hero and this subject are Gano\r\nand his treachery, which brings on the defeat of Roncesvalles.”\r\n\r\nThese are great merits. The principal defects are summed up by a genial\r\nadmirer, Leigh Hunt (_Stories from the Italian Poets_, vol. i.), as the\r\nwant of fine imagery and natural description, and frequent triviality\r\nand prolixity. The vulgarity objected to by the Italian critics must\r\nexist, but is not equally offensive to a foreigner. The poem is fully\r\nanalysed by Panizzi in the first volume of his edition of Boiardo, and\r\nits general character may be very well caught from Byron’s translation\r\nof the first canto. Pulci’s higher strain is ably conveyed in the\r\nfollowing portion of a translation of an episode by Lady Dacre:\r\n\r\n      _And because Love not willingly excuses\r\n      One who is loved and loveth not again;\r\n      (For tyrannous were deemed the rule he uses,\r\n      Should they who sue for pity sue in vain;\r\n      What gracious lord his faithful liege refuses?)\r\n      So when the gentle dame perceived the pain\r\n      That well-nigh wrought to death her valiant knight,\r\n      Her melting heart began his love requite._\r\n\r\n      _And from her eyes soft beamed the answering ray\r\n      That Oliver’s soul-thrilling glance returns;\r\n      Love in these gleamy lightnings loves to play\r\n      Till but one flame two youthful bosoms burns.\r\n      To tend his grievous wounds she comes one day,\r\n      And towards him with greeting mute she turns;\r\n      For on her lips her voiceless words are stayed,\r\n      And her bright eyes are fain to lend their aid._\r\n\r\n      _When Oliver perceived that Forisene\r\n      Accosted him with shrinking, timid grace,\r\n      The pains which insupportable had been,\r\n      Vanished, and to far other ills gave place:\r\n      His soul is tost sweet hopes and doubts between,\r\n      And you might almost 'mid these flutterings trace\r\n      A dear assurance to be loved by her;\r\n      For silence is Love’s best interpreter._\r\n\r\nNot much is known of Pulci’s life except that he was the intimate\r\nfriend, correspondent, and confidential agent of Lorenzo de’ Medici,\r\nand is said to have composed his poem at the request of Lorenzo’s\r\nmother, whom he celebrated after her death. The disposition of his\r\ncontemporaries to attribute the finest portions of his poem to Ficino\r\nand Politian may indicate some failure on his part to sustain the\r\npoetical character in his daily walk and conversation; while the more\r\nserious passages of his poetry, especially the noble pathos of the\r\ndeath of Orlando, disclose an elevated soul. Orlando, standing alone\r\namong his slaughtered friends on the battlefield of Roncesvalles, is\r\nvisited by the angel Gabriel, who offers him a new army, and promises\r\nthat earth and sea shall tremble at his name. But Orlando prefers to\r\nfollow those who are gone. The _Morgante_ was not printed till the year\r\nafter Pulci’s death. His minor works include a poem of humble life,\r\nin imitation of Lorenzo’s _Nencia_, and a series of polemical sonnets\r\nagainst Matteo Franco, who was equally dyslogistic on his own part.\r\nNeither poet need be taken very seriously.\r\n\r\nThe year preceding the appearance of the _Morgante_ (1486) saw the\r\nposthumous publication of the first part of another poem, which, from\r\nsome points of view, is entitled to rank at the very head of romantic\r\npoetry. This is the _Orlando Innamorato_ of MATTEO MARIA BOIARDO, Count\r\nof Scandiano. Little is known of his life except its simple and noble\r\noutline. He was born at his family seat of Scandiano, near Reggio, in\r\nthe Modenese, about 1434. Like his successors, Ariosto and Tasso, he\r\nwas a favourite at the court of the Duke of Ferrara, his sovereign. He\r\ncelebrated Antonia Caprara in his lyrics, and bestowed his hand upon\r\nTaddea Novellara. In his later years he was successively governor of\r\nModena and Reggio. In his disposition he was most generous, and too\r\nclement for his arduous public duties. He composed Latin poetry, and\r\ntranslated several classical and other authors; and died in 1494, on\r\nthe eve of the invasion of Charles VIII., prophetically bewailing\r\nthe consequent ruin of Italy at the end of his unfinished _Orlando\r\nInnamorato_, which he is supposed to have begun about 1472. The greater\r\npart of this poem had been published in 1486, the continuation is said\r\nto have appeared in 1495, but the edition of 1506 is the earliest now\r\nextant.\r\n\r\nAlthough Orlando and Rinaldo are the heroes, the story of Boiardo’s\r\npoem is original. “_Turpino istesso la nascose_,” he says. It is\r\nexceedingly graceful and ingenious. Argalia and his sister Angelica,\r\nthe children of the King of Cathay, present themselves at Charlemagne’s\r\ncourt. The former has an enchanted lance, by the virtue of which he\r\nmight have overthrown all Charles’s paladins; but the pig-headed\r\nSaracen Feraù persists, like Monsieur Jourdain’s servant, in thrusting\r\ntierce when he ought to thrust quarte, and Argalia is glad to make\r\nhis escape, leaving the lance behind him. It falls into the hands of\r\nAstolfo, the English knight, not hitherto especially distinguished\r\nin battle or tourney, but who at least possesses his countrymen’s\r\ncharacteristic of not knowing when they are beaten.\r\n\r\n      _Solea dir, ch’ egli era per sciagura,\r\n      E tornava a cader senza paura._\r\n\r\nBy means of this lance Astolfo performs the most signal exploits,\r\ndelivering Charles from the invasion of Gradasso, King of Sericana, who\r\nmakes war upon him to obtain Rinaldo’s steed Bajardo, and Orlando’s\r\nsword Durindana. Rinaldo and Orlando themselves are absent in pursuit\r\nof Angelica, who has returned to her own country. Angelica and Rinaldo\r\nare alternately wrought to fondness and antipathy through the spell of\r\nenchanted potions supplied by the poet _ad libitum_. Orlando, without\r\nobtaining any share of her affections, remains her humble slave. All\r\nare involved in a maze of adventures, most cunningly interwoven,\r\nreplete with the endless delight of inexhaustible invention and the\r\nsurprise of perpetual novelty. No motto for the poem could be more\r\nappropriate than that with which Panizzi prefaces his edition:\r\n\r\n      _Ille per extentum funem mihi posse videtur\r\n      Ire poeta, meum qui pectus inaniter angit,\r\n      Irritat, mulcet, falsis terroribus implet,\r\n      Ut magus, et modo me Thebis, modo ponit Athenis._\r\n\r\nIn spite of the wild and fanciful character of the incidents, a deep\r\ninterest is excited for the principal personages, who are truly human,\r\nexcept when avowedly of the _fortisque Gyas fortisque Cloanthus_ order,\r\nor, as the Italian poet himself has it,\r\n\r\n      _Avino, Avolio, Ottone, e Berlinghiero._\r\n\r\nIn this respect Boiardo has a great advantage over Spenser; his\r\ncharacters are actual people, not mere abstractions, and he is\r\nunencumbered with allegory. As a master of poetic language he is\r\ngreatly inferior. Though both picturesque and tuneful, he is far from\r\nrivalling the colour and music of the Englishman. Compared to the\r\n_Faerie Queene_ his poem is as his own clear-chiming octave to the\r\nsonorous magnificence of the Spenserian stanza. In general, his tone is\r\nmuch more easy and familiar than Spenser’s; when he chooses, however,\r\nhis sentiment is more elevated and his pathos more moving. Poetry has\r\nfew passages at once so nobly heroic and so exquisitely touching as\r\nthe combat between Orlando and Agricane, epitomised by Leigh Hunt in\r\nhis _Stories from the Italian Poets_. The pen fell from Boiardo’s hand\r\njust as he was bringing his errant heroes back to encounter the new\r\ninvasion of the African king Agramante, and the powerful hand that took\r\nit up used it to delay the approaching denouement, and superimpose a\r\nnew structure upon the original foundation. In every literary quality\r\nAriosto excels Boiardo, but he is a remove further from the realms of\r\nchivalry and fairie, and\r\n\r\n          _Never can recapture\r\n      The first fine careless rapture._\r\n\r\nBoth are poets of the Renaissance, but Ariosto has more of that\r\naspect of pomp and luxury which estranged Ruskin, and Boiardo of\r\nthat half-erudite, half-ignorant naïveté which so fascinates in the\r\npictures of Botticelli and Roselli. The following stanzas, translated\r\nby Miss Ellen Clerke, form an excellent specimen of Boiardo’s manner in\r\ngeneral, and exemplify that delightful blending of classic and romantic\r\nfeeling only possible in the youth of a literature:\r\n\r\n      _In the glade’s heart a youth upon the sward,\r\n      All nude, disported him with song and jest;\r\n      Three ladies fair, to serve their love and lord,\r\n      Danced round him, they, too, nude and all undrest.\r\n      Unmeet for sword and shield, for watch and ward,\r\n      He seemed, with eyes of brown, and sunny crest.\r\n      That yet the dim upon his cheek had sprouted,\r\n      By some might be averred, by others doubted._\r\n\r\n      _Of roses, violets, and all blossoms pied,\r\n      Full baskets holding, they their merry game\r\n      Of love and frolic on the greensward plied,\r\n      When Montalbano’s Lord upon them came.\r\n      'Behold the traitor!’ with one voice they cried;\r\n      'Behold the recreant!’ did all exclaim.\r\n      'Him, who all joy contemned of sense enraptured,\r\n      Now in his own despite our snare hath captured.’_\r\n\r\n      _And with their baskets, when these words were said,\r\n      They on Rinaldo flung themselves amain;\r\n      One violets threw, another roses red,\r\n      Lilies and hyacinths they strewed like rain;\r\n      Each blow unto his heart keen anguish sped,\r\n      The marrow of his bones was searched with pain,\r\n      With burning aches they sting where’er they settle,\r\n      As though of fire were leaf and flower and petal._\r\n\r\n      _The youth who nude had figured on the scene,\r\n      When all his basket he had emptied out,\r\n      With a tall lily-stem full-branched with green,\r\n      Rinaldo on Mambrino’s helm did flout.\r\n      No help availed that baron bold, I ween,\r\n      Felled like a four-year child beneath the clout,\r\n      Scarce touched he earth, ere he who thus had mauled him,\r\n      Caught by the heels and round the meadow hauled him._\r\n\r\n      _Each of those ladies three a garland wore,\r\n      Of roses twined, deep damask or snow-white;\r\n      Each from her head its garniture now tore,\r\n      Since other weapons failed them for the fight,\r\n      And though the knight cried mercy o’er and o’er,\r\n      They ceased not, e’en when tired, to scourge and smite,\r\n      And dragged him round, and did with blows belabour,\r\n      Until the noonday sun shone on their labour._\r\n\r\n      _Nor hauberk stout, nor iron plate of mail,\r\n      Those blows could fend, or parry their fierce might;\r\n      But all his flesh was bruised with wound and wale,\r\n      Beneath his arms, and with such fire alight,\r\n      That souls condemned, in the infernal vale,\r\n      Must of a surety suffer pains more slight\r\n      Than those in which this baron sore did languish,\r\n      When like to die of utter fear and anguish._\r\n\r\n      _Nor could he tell if gods or men were those,\r\n      Nor prayers availed, nor aught such foes could rout;\r\n      And thus continued they, nor took repose,\r\n      Till on their shoulders wings began to sprout,\r\n      Of white and gold, vermilion blent with rose;\r\n      While from each plume a living eye looked out,\r\n      Not peacock-orbed, or other fowl’s in seeming,\r\n      But like a lovely maiden’s softly gleaming._\r\n\r\n      _Then straight did they uplift themselves in flight,\r\n      And one by one unto high heaven upsoared,\r\n      Rinaldo, on the lawn, in doleful plight,\r\n      Now left alone, with tears his state deplored,\r\n      O’erwhelmed so sore with pain and woe that quite\r\n      His senses ebbed away, in grief outpoured;\r\n      And in the end such anguish did invade him,\r\n      That, as one dead, down on the sward he laid him._\r\n\r\nThe fastidious refinement of the Italians of the sixteenth century\r\nfor a time obscured the fame of one of their most delightful authors.\r\nWe have seen that Boiardo was a native of the district of Reggio; we\r\nhave also seen that Reggio was among the places which, in the opinion\r\nof no less eminent a judge than Dante, were disqualified by their\r\ndialect from ever producing a poet. It is no wonder, therefore, that\r\nthe _Orlando Innamorato_ should teem with inelegances of diction,\r\nscarcely perceptible to a foreigner, but which seemed most flagrant in\r\nan age when priests pocketed their breviaries for fear of contaminating\r\ntheir style. Two other poets independently addressed themselves to the\r\ntask of making Boiardo presentable. Domenichi, “a literary gentleman\r\nby trade,” did little good or harm; he neither added nor omitted a\r\nstanza, except in the first canto, and as he went on his emendations\r\nfell off. Berni, a great writer in his way, of whom much must be said\r\nwhen we treat of comic and familiar poetry, inserted many stanzas of\r\nhis own, and altered so many throughout as to metamorphose the spirit\r\nno less than the diction of the poem. Chivalry and humour are nicely\r\nbalanced throughout the original; the poet occasionally smiles at the\r\nextravagance of his own imaginations, but his irony never broadens\r\ninto burlesque. In Berni’s _rifacimento_ the element of humour greatly\r\npreponderates, and the elegance and grace of the adulteration make no\r\nsufficient amends for the transposition of a noble poem from an heroic\r\ninto a familiar key. Although his _rifacimento_ was not frequently\r\nreprinted, it attained such celebrity in literary circles that Boiardo\r\nwas almost forgotten, and the _Orlando Innamorato_ commonly passed\r\nunder Berni’s name. No edition of the original as Boiardo wrote it was\r\npublished from 1544 to 1830, when Antonio Panizzi, doubtless stimulated\r\nby the circumstance that he himself was born near Reggio,[13]\r\nredeemed it from oblivion, and restored it to the place it has ever\r\nsince maintained as a star of at least the second magnitude in the\r\nconstellation of Italian epic poetry.\r\n\r\nThe almost simultaneous appearance of two such poems as the _Morgante_\r\nand the _Orlando_ by two writers of such social and intellectual\r\ndistinction as Pulci and Boiardo, indicates that the love of chivalrous\r\nfiction must have been very rife in Italy. It is remarkable that\r\nthe Italian writers should have so rarely essayed the easier path\r\nof prose-romance, but this they left to the Spaniards, who on their\r\npart, excepting in ballads, in that age rarely ventured upon poetical\r\ncomposition. One only of the Italian romantic epics between Boiardo\r\nand Ariosto deserves mention. It is the Mambriano of FRANCESCO BELLO,\r\nknown as _Il Cieco d’Adria_. The blind bard amused the court of Mantua\r\nwith recitations which he afterwards stitched together into a long poem\r\ndevoid of all pretence to epic unity. But, as he himself observes, he\r\nthought he had done enough in bringing all the paladins back to Paris,\r\nand rendering all the Saracens tributary to the Emperor. His diction is\r\noften as unshapen as his story; nevertheless, he is a real poet, and\r\nhis description of the Temple of Mars in particular will compare not\r\nunfavourably with those of Statius, Chaucer, and Boccaccio.\r\n\r\nBefore parting with the predecessors of Ariosto, a word should be said\r\nof Boiardo’s minor poems. Besides a comedy, _Timone_, to be noticed\r\nhereafter, he wrote numerous canzoni and sonnets. Of these Panizzi\r\njustly says: “Boiardo’s poetry, although in the manner of Petrarch,\r\nhas all the marks of originality, and resembles more the character\r\nof the predecessors of the Bard of Laura than of his successors. His\r\npoetry was not written to be read, but to be sung, and was submitted\r\nto those musical as well as metrical laws by which that of Petrarch\r\nhad been governed. In his day, music was still subject to poetry, and\r\nthe inanimate instruments were designed to support, not to drown, the\r\nhuman voice.” Panizzi, therefore, seems to consider Boiardo the last\r\nof the truly melodious lyrists of Italy; though it is just to point\r\nout that his remark respecting the predominance of the instrument over\r\nthe voice did not become applicable until the seventeenth century, and\r\nthat he elsewhere seems to confine the decay of Italian melody to the\r\ntwo centuries immediately preceding his own time (1830). His edition of\r\nBoiardo’s lyrics is almost inaccessible; but he has quoted enough in\r\nhis memoir of the author to confirm his favourable judgment of their\r\nliterary qualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] Morgante is the name of a giant converted to Christianity by\r\nOrlando. He dies in the middle of the poem.\r\n\r\n[12] The evident Greek derivation of this name from _margos_\r\n(gluttonous) lends some countenance to the suspicion that Politian had\r\na hand in Pulci’s poem.\r\n\r\n[13] It is curious to note in this connection that Rubiera, the\r\noriginal seat of Boiardo’s family, having become a state prison under\r\nthe modern Dukes of Modena, gave Panizzi the subject for his first\r\npublication, known under the abridged title of _I Processi di Rubiera_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n                       ARIOSTO AND HIS IMITATORS\r\n\r\n\r\nBoiardo had accomplished a great work. He had raised the old chivalric\r\nromance to epic dignity, and shown its capability of classic form.\r\nThis, impeded by his provincial education and the low standard of\r\npoetry prevailing in his time, he had not himself been able to impart.\r\nThe achievement was reserved for one who has infinitely transcended\r\nhim in reputation, though it may be questioned whether he has indeed\r\ngreatly surpassed him in any respect but style and the gift of\r\nstory-telling, and who is certainly inferior to him in sincerity and\r\nsimplicity.\r\n\r\nLODOVICO ARIOSTO was born at Reggio, near which town Boiardo also\r\nhad first seen the light, on September 8, 1474. His family was noble,\r\nand his father, who survived his birth about twenty years, filled\r\nmany important offices. Like the fathers of Petrarch and Boccaccio,\r\nhe insisted that his son should follow the profession of the law,\r\nwhich the youth renounced after five years of fruitless, perhaps\r\nnot very persevering study. His father’s death left Ariosto at the\r\nhead of a large family, for which he had to provide out of a scanty\r\npatrimony. He solaced his cares by classical studies, which made him a\r\nfair Latin poet. About 1503 he entered the service of the Cardinal of\r\nEste, brother of the Duke of Ferrara, and hence a member of that house\r\nwhose glory it has been to have numbered two of the most illustrious\r\npoets of Italy in its train, and whose infelicity to have derived more\r\nobloquy than honour from the connection. Boiardo’s _Orlando Innamorato_\r\nhad been designed for the glorification of the house of Este, but\r\nthe purpose is not sufficiently obtrusive to spoil our pleasure in\r\nthe poet’s ideal world. Ariosto took up the thread of the narrative\r\nwhere his predecessor had dropped it, and writing in the spirit of\r\na courtier, produced in the _Orlando Furioso_ a sequel related to\r\nBoiardo’s poem much as Virgil’s national epic on the wanderings of\r\nÆneas is related to Homer’s artless tale of the wanderings of Ulysses.\r\n\r\nIn so far as Ariosto’s objects were poetical fame and the honour of\r\nhis native country they were attained to the full; but his toil was\r\nalmost vain as respected recompense from the princes for whose sake\r\nhe had blemished his poem. The Cardinal, a coarse, unscrupulous man,\r\nfitter for a soldier than an ecclesiastic, was apparently unable to\r\ndiscern any connection between Ruggiero’s hippogriff and the glories\r\nof his descendants, and upon the publication of the _Orlando_ in\r\n1510, asked the poet quite simply “where he had been for all that\r\nrot?” He is stated, however, to have presented Ariosto with a golden\r\nchain, rather for the ornament of his person than the relief of his\r\nnecessities, as he could not venture to turn it into money. Ariosto\r\nfurther incurred his Eminence’s displeasure by hesitating to accompany\r\nhim on a mission to Hungary, and found it advisable to exchange his\r\nservice for the Duke’s. The Duke, a prince lavish in shows, economical\r\nin salaries, thought the poet abundantly rewarded by the governorship\r\nof the Garfagnana, which it was necessary to confer upon somebody. The\r\nGarfagnana was a wild district overrun with poetical banditti, readers\r\nand admirers of their governor’s epic. Here Ariosto gained much honour,\r\nbut little emolument.\r\n\r\nHis experience of his patrons generally justified his favourite motto,\r\n_Pro bono malum_. Even the munificent Leo X. did nothing for him\r\nbut kiss him on both cheeks, and remit half the fees upon the brief\r\nthat assured his copyrights, his particular friend Cardinal Bibbiena\r\npocketing the other. His sole real benefactor was the Marquis del\r\nVasto, husband of the lady whom we shall find celebrated by Luigi\r\nTansillo, who settled an annuity of a hundred ducats upon him. Even\r\nthis was consideration for value to be received, the Marquis, himself a\r\npoet, being properly impressed by the _Vixere fortes ante Agamemnona_\r\nmaxim. Ariosto acquitted himself of his obligation like a man,\r\ncomparing his patron to Cæsar, Nestor, Achilles, Nireus, and Ladas.\r\nGreat as was the renown which his _Orlando_ procured for him in his\r\nlifetime, its profits were not such as to render him independent of\r\npatronage; yet, after all, he was able to boast that the modest house\r\nwhich he built for himself, and where he died in 1533, was paid for\r\nby his own money.[14] It is kept to this day by the municipality of\r\nFerrara; and Ariosto’s manuscripts, evincing his indefatigable care in\r\nthe revision of his poem, are preserved in the public library.\r\n\r\nThe chief literary occupations of his latter years had been the\r\ncomposition of comedies, the superintendence of theatrical performances\r\nfor the entertainment of the Duke, and the incessant revision of the\r\n_Orlando Furioso_, enlarged from forty to forty-six cantos. The last\r\nedition published under his own inspection appeared in 1532, and was\r\nnot regarded by him as definitive. He also began a continuation,\r\nintended to narrate the death of Ruggiero by the treachery of Gano, of\r\nwhich only five cantos were written.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo great is the variety of the _Orlando Furioso_, that it appears\r\ndifficult at first to discover a clue to a main action among its\r\nthronging and complicated adventures. Ginguené and Panizzi, however,\r\nhave shown that one exists, and that this is the union of Ruggiero and\r\nBradamante, the fabulous ancestors of the house of Este. All the poet’s\r\nskill is exerted to keep them apart, that he may bring them together\r\nat last. Orlando, Rinaldo, Angelica, the chief personages of the\r\n_Innamorato_, have become subordinate characters; and, notwithstanding\r\nthe title of the poem, Orlando’s madness is but an episode. The\r\nunfortunate consequence is the transfer of the main interest from\r\npersonages whom Boiardo had made highly attractive, to Ruggiero and\r\nBradamante, less impressive in the hands of Ariosto, whose forte is\r\nrather in depicting tender or humorous than heroic character. It would\r\nnot be just to say that this occasions the chief disadvantage of the\r\npoem in comparison with the _Innamorato_, the loss of the elder poet’s\r\ndelightful naïveté. Rather the change of plan and the falling off in\r\nsimplicity spring from the same root, the taste and character of the\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nAriosto was more of a courtier than a knight, and thought more of\r\nthe house of Este than of the paladins of Charlemagne. He wrought\r\nupon Boiardo in the spirit of Dryden adapting Chaucer; while his\r\npredecessor, though himself courtly, may rather be likened to William\r\nMorris. Boiardo, though also purposing the panegyric of the house of\r\nEste, sings for the delight of singing, and introduces no incongruous\r\nfifteenth-century figures into his romantic pageant. Ariosto mars\r\nhis epic by contemporary allusions, as Spenser and Tennyson marred\r\ntheirs by far-fetched allegory. It must be remembered, in justice to\r\nhim, that his perpetual adulation of the court of Ferrara seemed less\r\nextravagant then than now. To us the importance attached to a family\r\nwhich would be forgotten if Ariosto and Tasso had not swelled its\r\nretinue, and if Lucrezia Borgia had not married into it, borders on the\r\nabsurd. It seems preposterous that hosts should be equipped, and giants\r\nand dragons and enchanters set in motion, and paladins despatched on\r\nerrands to the moon, that Ariosto may compliment a cardinal whose\r\nwant of culture rather than his penetration led him to rate these\r\ncompliments at their worth. But in Ariosto’s day that court was a\r\nbright and dazzling reality, and almost every member of his immediate\r\ncircle depended upon it for his bread.\r\n\r\nIf we can forget his servility, or persuade ourselves to deem it\r\nloyalty, we shall find little to censure in Ariosto. Shelley’s\r\nassertion that he is only sometimes a poet implies a narrow conception\r\nof the nature of poetry. Rather may it be said that he is always a\r\npoet, always fanciful, always musical, always elevated, though not\r\nalways to a very great altitude, above the level of the choicest prose.\r\nIt is true that he has nothing of the seer in his composition, that\r\nhis perfect technical mastery is rarely either exalted or disturbed by\r\nany gleam of the light that never was on sea or land, that his poem\r\nis destitute of moral or patriotic purpose, and that his standard in\r\nall things is that of his age. This merely proves that he is not in\r\nthe rank of supremely great poets--a position which he would not have\r\nclaimed for himself; nor have his countrymen paralleled him with Dante.\r\nHe is hardly to be called Homeric, though endowed with the Homeric\r\nrapidity, directness, conciseness, and, except when he voluntarily\r\nturns to humour and burlesque, much of the Homeric nobility.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the nearest literary analogy to the _Orlando Furioso_ in\r\nanother language is the _Metamorphoses_ of Ovid. In both poems appear\r\nthe same perspicuity and facility of narration, the same sweetness of\r\nversification, the same art of interweaving episodes into a whole.\r\nAriosto’s vigour and directness, nevertheless, are wanting to Ovid, and\r\nthe palm of invention and of the delineation of character undoubtedly\r\nbelongs to him, for Ovid was forbidden to introduce a new incident, or\r\nvary any of the personages afforded by his mythological repertory. The\r\nfact that the _Orlando_ is not, like the _Jerusalem_, a new _Æneid_,\r\nbut a new _Metamorphoses_, entirely justifies the introduction of\r\nsuch burlesque satire as the abode of Discord among the monks, or\r\nsuch delightful extravagance as Astolfo’s flight to the moon in quest\r\nof Orlando’s brains, resulting in the recovery of no inconsiderable\r\nportion of his own. Such episodes are, indeed, the most characteristic\r\npassages of the _Furioso_; yet in others, such as the siege of Paris\r\nand the madness of Orlando, Ariosto shows himself capable of rising to\r\nepical dignity, which he could have assumed more frequently if it had\r\nentered into his plan. This rather required the gifts of the painter,\r\nwhether of natural scenery or of human emotion, which he possessed in\r\nthe most eminent degree; and of the ironic but kindly observer of human\r\nlife, which he exhibited so fully that even his descriptions are less\r\npopular and admired than the reflective and moralising introductions to\r\nhis cantos. Never was such wildness of imagination ballasted with such\r\nsolid good sense. Yet, when all is said, his most distinctive merit\r\nremains his unsurpassed talent of exposition, his unfaltering flow of\r\nenergetic, perspicuous, melodious narrative; excellence apparently\r\nspontaneous and unstudied, but in truth due to the strenuous revision\r\nof one who judged himself severely, and deemed with Michael Angelo that\r\ntrifles made perfection, and perfection was no trifle. Mr. Courthope,\r\nin an admirable parallel, has pointed out his great superiority as a\r\nnarrator to his disciple Spenser, whose pictures, nevertheless, glow\r\nwith deeper and softer tints, and whose voluminous melody tills the ear\r\nmore perfectly than Ariosto’s ringing stanza.\r\n\r\nThe controversy whether Ariosto or Tasso’s poem is the greater epic,\r\nas it was one of the most obstinately interminable ever raised by\r\nacademic pedantry, is also one of the idlest. They belong to different\r\ndepartments of art; it would be as reasonable to compare a picture\r\nwith a statue. The question, nevertheless, which of the men was the\r\ngreater poet, does admit of profitable discussion, though it may be\r\ndifficult to establish any but a subjective criterion. If endowment\r\nwith the poetical temperament is to be taken as the test, the palm\r\ncertainly belongs to Tasso, whose actions, thoughts, and misfortunes\r\nare invariably those of a poet, and whose inward music is constantly\r\nfinding expression in lyrical verse. Ariosto’s comparatively few lyrics\r\ngenerally wear a less spontaneous aspect than Tasso’s; the incidents of\r\nhis life rather bespeak the man of affairs than the man of books; and\r\nif his _Orlando_ had perished, we should hardly have surmised how great\r\na poet had been lost in him.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the palm should be bestowed for mastery of\r\nart, it seems rather due to Ariosto, who handles his theme with\r\nmore vigour, and has it more thoroughly under control. He is not\r\nobliged, like Tasso, to embellish his poem with episodes which, by\r\ntheir superior attractiveness, almost eclipse the main action: the\r\nfew passages of the kind in the _Orlando_ are strictly subordinate,\r\nand not among its principal ornaments. The chief artistic blots upon\r\nhis poem could not well have been avoided. So completely, though\r\nunjustly, has he overshadowed his predecessor Boiardo, that we are apt\r\nto forget that his work is an example, unique in literature, of the\r\nsuccessful continuation of another’s. The adulation of the house of\r\nEste was an inheritance from his precursor; it is only to be regretted\r\nthat, contrary to the example of Boiardo and the subsequent practice\r\nof Tasso, he should have given it disproportionate prominence. The\r\nincurable defect of the action of the _Furioso_ is also a legacy from\r\nthe _Innamorato_. Ruggiero, the real hero of Ariosto’s part of the\r\npoem, wins the hand of Bradamante, and becomes the ancestor of the\r\nhouse of Este, by apostasy. The poem finds him a pagan, and leaves him\r\na Christian. All that ingenuity can effect is employed to extenuate his\r\ndesertion; nevertheless, the sympathies of every reader must be with\r\nthe Saracen Rodomonte when he appears in the last canto to tax Ruggiero\r\nwith his change of sides, and necessarily (for otherwise what would\r\nhave become of the house of Este?) is slain for his loyalty, to the\r\nscandal of poetical justice.\r\n\r\nThat Ariosto, apart from his boundless invention and command of\r\nlanguage and narrative, was a true poet, is shown by the extreme beauty\r\nof the majority of the introductions to his cantos, where he appears\r\neven more at home than in the descriptions of the deeds of prowess\r\nof which he was at bottom so sceptical. Another strong point is the\r\nnumber, vividness, and originality of his similes, not in general\r\ncopied from ancient poets, but peculiar to himself, and perfectly\r\ndescriptive of the object designed to be illustrated. One of the\r\nmost apparently characteristic similes of a great master of quaint\r\ncomparison, the late Coventry Patmore, is borrowed from him.[15]\r\n\r\nThe sense of Ariosto is easily represented in English, but it is\r\nanother matter to reproduce his felicity of phrase. The following\r\nstanzas in Miss Ellen Clerke’s version are from the description of\r\nAngelica’s flight from Rinaldo:\r\n\r\n      _Through dark and fearsome woods she takes her flight,\r\n      By desert places wild, and lonely ways.\r\n      The stirring of the leaves and foliage light\r\n      Of oak, or elm, or beech that softly sways,\r\n      Doth startle her aside in sudden fright,\r\n      To wander here and there as in a maze;\r\n      While every shadow seen on hill or hollow\r\n      Seems to her fear Rinaldo’s who doth follow._\r\n\r\n      _As baby fawn, or tender bleating goat,\r\n      Which from its leafy cradle hath espied\r\n      Its hapless dam seized by the quivering throat,\r\n      By leopard fierce, and oped her breast or side,\r\n      Flees from the brute to sylvan depths remote,\r\n      Trembling with fears by fancy multiplied,\r\n      And at each stump that she in passing touches,\r\n      Deems that the monster grasps her in its clutches._\r\n\r\n\r\n_That day and night, and all the next, sped she In circles round about,\r\nshe knew not where, But reached at last a grove right fair to see,\r\nStirred lightly by the cool and fragrant air. Two crystal streamlets,\r\nmurmuring o’er the lea, Perennially refreshed the herbage there, And a\r\nsweet tune sang, in melodious treble, Their gentle current, chafed by\r\nflint and pebble._\r\n\r\n_And deeming that she here is safe indeed, A thousand miles beyond\r\nRinaldo’s quest, Weary of summer heat and travel speed, Resolves she\r\nfor brief spell to take a rest; 'Mid flowers dismounts, and looses in\r\nthe mead Her palfrey, and doth of the rein divest, To wander by the\r\nwave pellucid flowing, With juicy grasses on its margin growing._\r\n\r\n_A tempting bush site sees, not far away, Of thorn a-bloom with roses\r\nblushing red, Which in the wave doth glass itself alway, Screened from\r\nthe sun by spreading oaks o’erhead. An empty space within it doth\r\ndisplay A chamber cool, with densest shade o’erspread, Where leaves and\r\nbranches roof so close have woven, Nor sun nor glance its dusk hath\r\never cloven._\r\n\r\n_A couch of softest grass within the lair Invites to rest upon its\r\nherbage sweet. Down in its midst doth sink the lady fair, And lays her\r\nthere, and sleeps in that retreat; But not for long, for shortly she\r\nwas 'ware Of the approaching tread of coming feet. She softly rises,\r\nand through leaves a-quiver A knight in armour sees draw near the\r\nriver._\r\n\r\nThe morality of the _Orlando Furioso_, some licentious episodes\r\nexcepted which stand quite apart from the main action, may be\r\nconsidered good, being that of a refined and courtly circle where lofty\r\nvirtues were cordially recognised in theory, however they might fail to\r\nbe exemplified in practice. Ariosto does not, like Tasso, convey the\r\nimpression of a man above his time, and only depressed to its level by\r\nunpropitious circumstances. He is the child of his age, at the summit\r\nof its average elevation, but not transcending this. Yet it would have\r\nbeen well for Italy if her princes and statesmen had generally acted\r\nupon those ideas of honour and loyalty which they found and doubtless\r\nadmired in their favourite poet. Such precepts as the following, even\r\nthough enforced by the teacher’s example, were in their view much too\r\ngood for ordinary practice:\r\n\r\n      _Bundle with cord is not so bound, I ween,\r\n      Or plank to plank so riveted by nail,\r\n      As knightly troth that once hath plighted been,\r\n      Doth with the true and loyal soul prevail.\r\n      Nor is Fidelity depicted seen,\r\n      Save robed from head to foot in candid veil,\r\n      Visage enveloping and frame and limb,\r\n      Since but one stain would make her wholly dim._\r\n\r\n      _Pure must she ever be, and free from spot,\r\n      If to one only or to thousands plighted;\r\n      Nor less if vowed in woodland wild or grot\r\n      Far from men’s ways and dwellings disunited,\r\n      Than where the judge doth duly law allot,\r\n      And deeds are sealed, and testimonies cited.\r\n      Nor oath she needs, or like appeal to Heaven;\r\n      Enough the solemn word once gravely given._\r\n\r\n      _His pledge chivalric, and the faith he gave,\r\n      Zerbin in every circumstance defended;\r\n      But ne’er did prove himself their duteous slave\r\n      More than when now disconsolate he wended\r\n      With this detested hag, whom like the grave\r\n      His soul abhorred: by plague or death attended,\r\n      Full sooner had he fared; but honour’s claim\r\n      Bound him to that objectionable dame._\r\n\r\nTo appreciate Zerbino’s fidelity to his word, it must be known that,\r\nhaving been vanquished in a joust, he has been compelled to vow to\r\nescort a hideous old woman of singular depravity, and to maintain her\r\nbeauty and virtue against all comers, with the prospect of being killed\r\nin her service. A more comic situation will hardly be found in any of\r\nthe romances.\r\n\r\nAriosto’s comedies must be considered along with the Italian drama\r\nin general. The most important of his minor poetical works are the\r\nSatires, rather in the vein of Horace than of Juvenal, and, in truth,\r\nhardly satires at all in any proper sense of the term. They are good\r\nmetrical talk on light subjects, elegant, chatty, and discursive. His\r\nown disappointments are alluded to very good-humouredly. His lyrical\r\npieces are not remarkable, except one impressive sonnet, in which he\r\nappears to express compunction for the irregularities of his life:\r\n\r\n      _How may I deem That thou in heaven wilt hear,\r\n        O Lord divine, my fruitless prayer to Thee,\r\n        If for all clamour of the tongue Thou see\r\n      That yet unto the heart the net is dear?\r\n      Sunder it Thou, who all behold’st so clear,\r\n        Nor heed the stubborn will’s oppugnancy,\r\n        And this do Thou perform, ere, fraught with me,\r\n      Charon to Tartarus his pinnace steer.\r\n      By habitude of ill that veils Thy light,\r\n        And sensual lure, and paths in error trod,\r\n        Evil from good no more I know aright.\r\n      Ruth for frail soul submissive to the rod\r\n        May move a mortal; in her own despite\r\n        To drag her heavenward is work of God._\r\n\r\nLate in life the poet married; whether he also reformed seems\r\ndoubtful. His amours, however, were unaccompanied by tragedy or\r\nscandal. In fact, this most wildly imaginative of the Italian poets\r\nseems to have had less than most poets of the poetic temperament, and\r\nthe amiability for which he is universally praised was not accompanied\r\nby any remarkable acuteness of feeling. His virtues were those of an\r\nexcellent man of the world; he was liberal, courteous, sensible, just,\r\nand sincere.\r\n\r\nThe success of the _Orlando Furioso_, which Bernardo Tasso, writing\r\nin 1559, affirms to be better known and more talked of than Homer,\r\nnaturally produced the same effect as the popularity of Scott and\r\nByron produced in England--“All could raise the flower, for all\r\nhad got the seed.” The two most important of these imitations, the\r\n_Girone il Cortese_ of Luigi Alamanni and the _Amadigi_ of Bernardo\r\nTasso--both good poets, to be mentioned again in other departments\r\nof literature--resemble Pygmalion’s image before the interposition\r\nof Venus; all the constituents of a fine poem are there, but the\r\nbreath of life is wanting. “The _Girone_,” says Ginguené, “is a very\r\ndignified, very rational, and generally well-written poem, but cold\r\nand consequently somewhat tiresome.” If there is more warmth in the\r\n_Amadigi_, there is also more loquacity, and the power of the author,\r\nan excellent writer on a small scale, is quite inadequate to sustain\r\ncontinuous interest through a hundred cantos. The comparison which he\r\nnecessarily courts with the old romance of Vasco Lobeira, the best work\r\nof its class, is always unfavourable to him. His copious employment\r\nof elfin machinery gave him opportunities of which he failed to avail\r\nhimself. The best of him as an epic writer is his gift of brilliant\r\ndescription. The younger Tasso’s _Rinaldo_ is a very extraordinary\r\nproduction for a youth of eighteen, but the impulse towards the\r\nchivalrous epic was exhausted by his time, and he wisely found another\r\nway of rivalling Ariosto. The _Orlandino_ and the _Ricciardetto_ belong\r\nrather to the class of the mock heroic, to be treated hereafter. The\r\nnames of a few of the most remarkable _bona-fide_ attempts at chivalric\r\npoetry must suffice: the _Guerino il Meschino_ of Tullia d’Aragona,\r\nthe _Ogier the Dane_ of Cassiodoro Narni, the _Death of Ruggiero_ of\r\nGiambatista Pescatore, the _Triumphs of Charlemagne_ of Francesco de’\r\nLodovici, the _First Exploits of Orlando_ of Lodovico Dolce, and the\r\n_Angelica Innamorata_ of Vincenzo Brusantini.\r\n\r\nApart from the poems of the chivalric cycles, Italy witnessed but few\r\nattempts at epic in the first half of the sixteenth century. Of the\r\nauthor of one of these, however, it might be said, _Magnis excidit\r\nausis_. GIOVANNI GIORGIO TRISSINO was born of a noble family at Vicenza\r\nin 1478. He repaired the defects of a neglected education with singular\r\nindustry, and endeared himself to the two Medici Popes, Leo and\r\nClement, who entrusted him with important diplomatic missions. His most\r\nsuccessful poetical work, the tragedy of _Sophonisba_ (1515), brought\r\nhim great fame, and actually does mark an era in the history of the\r\ndrama. He wrote much on grammar, but could effect only one reform, the\r\ndistinction between _i_ and _j_ and _u_ and _v_. After his retirement\r\nfrom diplomacy Trissino lived many years among his fellow-citizens,\r\nwealthy and honoured; but his later years were embittered by a painful\r\nand disastrous lawsuit with his son by his first marriage. He died in\r\n1549.\r\n\r\nTrissino had commenced in 1525 the composition of his epic, _The\r\nDeliverance of Italy from the Goths_, which was published in 1547 and\r\n1548. It has some literary interest as the first attempt to write\r\nItalian epic poetry in blank verse, but its great misfortune is to be\r\nin verse of any kind. The diction is good, the exposition simple and\r\nclear; if turned into prose it would make a pleasant story for youth,\r\nsomething like Fénelon’s _Telemachus_. But how a man of Trissino’s\r\ncultivation could have persuaded himself that a mere metrical form,\r\nand this neither artful nor tuneful, could turn prose into poetry,\r\nis indeed difficult to understand. The disyllabic termination of the\r\nlines--almost inevitable in Italian--is not conducive to metrical\r\nmajesty at the best; and Trissino seems to have had no idea of cadence\r\nor variety, and to have been content if he could scan his lines upon\r\nhis fingers. There is no inspiration, and no pretence to inspiration,\r\nfrom exordium to peroration of his sober epic; his Pegasus is not only\r\na pack-horse, but a pack-horse without bells.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the displacement of the Goths, making room for the Pope, the\r\nLombard and the Byzantine Exarch, was no deliverance for Italy, but\r\nher great misfortune. A poet, however, is not obliged like a historian\r\nto distinguish nicely between Theodoric and Alaric; and Trissino, with\r\nall his pedantry, might have ranked as a bard if he could have felt\r\nas a patriot; if he could have depicted the Italy of the Goths as the\r\nprototype of the Italy of his own age, rent amid French and Spaniards\r\nand Germans. Whether he conceived the idea or not, he could not or\r\ndared not give it utterance. He nevertheless energetically denounced\r\nthe abuses of the Papacy by a prophecy put into the mouth of an angel.\r\n\r\nThe history of chivalric poetry is especially interesting, as it in\r\nall probability exactly repeats that of the Homeric epic. While the\r\ngreat events, the siege of Troy and the Saracen invasion of France,\r\nare being really enacted, we have no poetry at all. After two or three\r\ncenturies ballads appear, disfiguring genuine history, and shifting\r\nits centre of gravity to incidents unimportant in themselves, but\r\nsusceptible of poetical treatment. After two or three more, poets arise\r\nwho embellish these romances, bestow poetical form upon them, and\r\nwork them into consistent wholes. Had Italy been no further advanced\r\nthan Greece at the corresponding epoch, the poems of Boiardo and\r\nAriosto would have braved two centuries of oral recitation, and come\r\nmuch corrupted and interpolated into the hands of some Aristarchus\r\nwho would have given them their final form. The invention of printing\r\nsuppressed this ultimate stage of development, but encouraged the\r\ngrowth of imitators, whom it preserved from annihilation, while unable\r\nto preserve them from oblivion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] _Parva sed apta mihi, sed nulli obnoxia; sed non Sordida, parta\r\nmeo sed tamen aere domus._\r\n\r\n\r\n[15] _Joltings of the heart, like wine Poured from a flask of narrow\r\nneck._ See _Orlando Furioso_, canto xxiii. st. 113.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n                     MACHIAVELLI AND GUICCIARDINI\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now traversed nearly three centuries of Italian literature\r\nwithout encountering one really great prose-writer, Boccaccio only\r\nexcepted. Unquestionably the development of Italian prose was\r\nretarded by the cultivation of Latin, which deprived it of ornaments\r\nin Petrarch, Pontano, and Æneas Sylvius--to say nothing of the\r\nburied talent which the example of such writers would have called\r\ninto activity. With every allowance on these accounts, it is still\r\nremarkable how generally the path of the historian of early Italian\r\nliterature lies amid the flowers of poetry and fiction. But the time\r\nhad now come when, as in Greece, the national genius was about to\r\nassert itself in prose, and, also as in Greece, the movement was\r\nheralded by historians. After a long interval, due to the exclusive\r\ncultivation of ancient models, the Italian Herodotus, Giovanni Villani,\r\nwas to be followed by two men who might dispute the character of the\r\nItalian Thucydides, who at all events belonged to that invaluable class\r\nof historians who, like Thucydides, in the events of which they are the\r\nnarrators and the judges. This advantage was possessed in an eminent\r\ndegree by FRANCESCO GUICCIARDINI, the historian of contemporary times;\r\nand though NICCOLÓ MACHIAVELLI did not write his principal work as\r\na contemporary, his knowledge of the Florentine constitution was so\r\nintimate as almost to invest him with the authority of an eye-witness\r\nof the Florentine revolutions of the past.\r\n\r\nNiccolò Machiavelli, the first Italian and almost the first modern to\r\ndisplay eminent genius as an historical and political writer, was born\r\nat Florence, May 3, 1469. His family had been illustrious for public\r\nservices; his father, whom he lost at sixteen, was a jurist; his mother\r\nwas a poetess. Little is known of his life until we find him in 1494\r\nsecretary to Marcello Virgilio, a learned man who four years afterwards\r\nbecame head of the chancery of the Republic, a post somewhat resembling\r\nMilton’s Latin Secretaryship under the Commonwealth, but allowing more\r\nactive participation in the business of diplomacy. Machiavelli rose\r\nalong with his patron, and in 1500 was entrusted with a mission to\r\nFrance. In the following year he had a more arduous part to play as\r\nenvoy to Cæsar Borgia, then consolidating his power in the Romagna, but\r\nfor the moment pressed with great difficulties. Machiavelli’s reports\r\nof his mission have been preserved, and attest the impression made upon\r\nhim by Cæsar’s supremacy in ability and villainy, which continued to\r\nfascinate him when years afterwards he composed his manual of political\r\nstatecraft.\r\n\r\nJudged in the sinister light which his writings have seemed to throw\r\nback upon his actions, he has been accused of having counselled and\r\ndevised the coup by which Cæsar destroyed his treacherous condottieri\r\nat Sinigaglia, as if the Borgia needed any tuition for an exploit of\r\nthis nature. He is also censured for recording it without disapproval;\r\nbut if Cæsar had never done anything worse than rid the Romagna of its\r\nvermin, history would not be severe with him. Two years later, employed\r\nupon a mission to Rome, he beheld Cæsar’s fall, and the elevation of\r\nPope Julius, whom he accompanied on yet another mission to the conquest\r\nof Bologna. He was also despatched about this time on embassies to\r\nGermany and France, and his observations on the circumstances and\r\ncharacteristics of both nations exhibit great sagacity. Soon afterwards\r\nthe affairs of the Republic became troubled, hemmed in as she was\r\nbetween the transalpine powers and the Pope and the exiled Medici.\r\nMachiavelli was actively engaged in organising her military resources,\r\nbut his efforts were fruitless. The restoration of the Medici was\r\neffected in September 1512. Machiavelli lost his employments, and soon\r\nafterwards, upon suspicion of participation in a conspiracy, was thrown\r\ninto prison, tortured, and owed his deliverance to an amnesty granted\r\nas an act of grace by the Medicean Pope Leo upon his election in 1513.\r\n\r\nHe retired to a small estate, where, as he tells us in a most\r\ninteresting letter which has reached our times, he consoled himself\r\nwith the study of the ancients, familiar intercourse with his rustic\r\nneighbours, and the composition of his _Prince_. The chief purpose of\r\nthis famous work certainly was not to recommend himself to the Medici,\r\nbut he would willingly have made it subservient to that end. They\r\nneglected him, however, until 1519, when Cardinal Medici, afterwards\r\nPope Clement VII., called upon him for a memoir on the best method of\r\nadministering the Florentine government, in which Machiavelli showed\r\nmuch dexterity in reconciling the interests of the house of Medici\r\nwith the interests of his country. His advice was not followed; but\r\nthe Cardinal commissioned him to write the history of Florence. He had\r\npreviously employed his leisure in the production of his memorable\r\ndiscourses on Livy, his comedy the _Mandragola_, and his life of\r\nCastruccio Castracani. In 1527 he was employed in fortifying Florence\r\nagainst an apprehended attack of the Imperial army, which fell upon\r\nRome, and he afterwards accompanied the forces sent to make a show\r\nof delivering the Pope. During his absence the Medicean government\r\nwas overthrown, an event highly agreeable to his secret wishes; but\r\nhis compliances had rendered him odious to the patriotic party, and\r\nhe returned to his native city to find himself the object of general\r\naversion and suspicion. His mortification probably hastened his death,\r\nwhich took place on June 21, 1527.\r\n\r\nOf all Machiavelli’s writings the _Prince_ is the most famous, and\r\ndeservedly, for it is the most characteristic. Few subjects of literary\r\ndiscussion have occasioned more controversy than the purpose of this\r\ncelebrated book. Some have beheld in it a manual for tyrants, like the\r\nmemoirs of Tiberius, so diligently perused by Domitian; others have\r\nregarded it as a refined irony upon tyranny, on the sarcastic plan of\r\nSwift’s Directions to Servants, if so humble an analogy be permissible.\r\nFrom various points of view it might alternately pass for either,\r\nbut its purpose is accurately conveyed by neither interpretation.\r\nMachiavelli was a sincere though too supple a republican, and by no\r\nmeans desired the universal prevalence of tyranny throughout Italy.\r\nIf he had written with the sole view of ingratiating himself with the\r\nMedici--probably in fact a subordinate motive with him, and the rather\r\nas there actually was a project for investing Giuliano de’ Medici\r\nwith the sovereignty of the Romagna, the theatre of Cæsar Borgia’s\r\nexploits--he would have been much more earnest in pressing it upon\r\ntheir attention. If, on the other hand, satire had been his chief\r\nobject, this would have been more mordant and poignant; his power of\r\ncontemptuous irony is only revealed in the short chapter on the Papal\r\nmonarchy. His aim probably was to show how to build up a principality\r\ncapable of expelling the foreigner and restoring the independence of\r\nItaly. But this intention could not be safely expressed, and hence his\r\nwork seems repulsive, because the reason of state which he propounds\r\nas an apology for infringing the moral code appears not patriotic, but\r\npurely selfish.\r\n\r\nIn our day we have seen Italian independence won by appeals to the\r\npatriotism of the nation at large. This was impossible in Machiavelli’s\r\ntime; nor, had it been otherwise, would his lips have been touched with\r\nthe live coal of a Mazzini. He could only speak as a politician to\r\npoliticians, and addressing himself as it were to a body of scientific\r\nexperts, he designedly excludes all considerations of morality. His\r\ntreatise appears antiquated in our day, when the national conscience\r\nis as easily manipulated as the conscience of the individual; in\r\noligarchical ages it passed not unreasonably for a perfect manual of\r\nstatecraft, and exercised great influence upon the statesmen of the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Frederick the Great assailed it\r\nvehemently in his youth, but lived to compliment it by what has been\r\ndescribed as the sincerest form of flattery. In Frederick’s century,\r\nwhen public affairs actually were in the hands of a few able rulers,\r\nit was worth attacking and defending; in the present democratic age,\r\nwhen a statesman who squared his conduct by its maxims would soon\r\nfind himself the object of popular odium, its interest, except as\r\nregards its weighty plea for a popular army, is mainly historical and\r\npsychological. There is an intimate connection between the _Prince_\r\nand the seven books on the _Art of War_, written about 1520. In the\r\n_Prince_ Machiavelli insists particularly upon the part which the\r\nhabit of relying upon treacherous and mutinous mercenaries, and the\r\nconsequent decay of public spirit among the citizens, had had in\r\nbringing about the ruin of the Italian states. In the _Art of War_\r\nhe shows how the citizen army he recommends is to be organised and\r\nled in battles and sieges. His experience of military affairs as an\r\neye-witness, as well as an administrator, had been considerable, and he\r\nis by no means to be slighted as a tactical writer; but the military\r\nart was on the eve of great changes, which rendered much of his wisdom\r\nobsolete.\r\n\r\nThe _Discourses on Livy’s Decades_ occupy a middle position between\r\npolitical and historical science. They are entirely grounded on the\r\nstudy of Livy; but their main importance consists not in the commentary\r\nupon the transactions Livy has related, but in the application of these\r\nto the general principles of politics and to the circumstances of the\r\nwriter’s own country. They may be defined as in some sort the _Prince_\r\nrewritten on a larger scale, and copiously illustrated by historical\r\nexamples; but the effect is much more pleasing. In the other book\r\nMachiavelli appears as the mere scientific analyst of politics, and his\r\nreal purpose might be reasonably questioned; but the _Discourses_ leave\r\nno doubt of his genuine patriotism and of his preference of morality to\r\nobliquity, except where, as it seems to him, the interest of the state\r\ninterferes. The problem of the permissibility of an act reprehensible\r\nin the abstract, but required by the safety of the stale--as, for\r\nexample, Mohammed Ali’s massacre of the Mamelukes--is a very difficult\r\none, and Machiavelli cannot be fairly judged from the standpoint of the\r\nnineteenth century. He had not seen the trial and failure of his ideal\r\nprince on a colossal scale in the person of Napoleon. It was a cardinal\r\nerror of his to deny a capacity of improvement to human nature and to\r\nassume that mankind would be essentially the same in all ages. We see,\r\non the contrary, that the general standard of righteousness has been\r\ngreatly raised since his time; and that, even if this were not so, the\r\nconditions of modern society are adverse to Machiavellian policy: to\r\nimport this perception, however, into the criticism of his work would\r\nbe but to reverse his own mistake. Many other criticisms might be\r\naddressed to him: he did not, for example, foresee that another set of\r\npatriots, from their own point of view, might arise, whose conception\r\nof the _summum bonum_ in polity would be entirely different from his\r\nown; and that within a few years his maxims might serve as an arsenal\r\nfor the Jesuits, whose objects would have been his utter abomination.\r\nWith all his faults and oversights, nothing can deprive Machiavelli of\r\nthe glory of having been the modern Aristotle in politics, the first,\r\nor at least the first considerable writer who derived a practical\r\nphilosophy from history, and exalted statecraft into science.\r\n\r\nMachiavelli’s _History of Florence_ is not, like his _Discourses_, a\r\nwork of profound thought, nor is it authoritative in any respect. It\r\nrather exhibits him as the elegant and accomplished man of letters,\r\nand is perhaps the first successful restoration of the classical\r\nstyle of history to a European vernacular. His great contemporary\r\nGuicciardini had indeed anticipated him with a fragment on the same\r\nsubject, but this long remained unpublished, and it is not likely that\r\nMachiavelli ever saw it. Machiavelli has not delved deep for materials;\r\nmuch of the early part of his history is taken almost literally from\r\nFlavio Biondo and other predecessors. He has sometimes departed\r\nunjustifiably from strict matter of fact, not by invention or serious\r\nmisrepresentation, but by accentuating and slightly modifying actual\r\nincidents to give them the particular colour he desires. In the main,\r\nhowever, his work is a faithful as well as an animated picture of the\r\npublic life of a community in its characteristics more nearly akin to\r\nthe ancient commonwealth of Athens than any the earth has seen since\r\nthis disappeared from her face. The quality which will preserve even a\r\nbad history, and without which a good one will only live as a book of\r\nreference, is never absent from Machiavelli’s--he entertains while he\r\ninstructs. His work, which was composed after 1520 by order of Cardinal\r\nGiulio de’ Medici, is divided into eight books, and extends from the\r\nbeginning of Florentine history to the death of Lorenzo de’ Medici in\r\n1492. The intimate connection of Florence with the general course of\r\nItalian politics leads to frequent digressions and copious notices of\r\nneighbouring states. Another historical work of Machiavelli’s, the Life\r\nof Castruccio Castracani, Prince of Lucca in the fourteenth century, is\r\nlittle more than a romance, in which he has endeavoured to depict the\r\nideal soldier and statesman.\r\n\r\nMachiavelli’s plays and poems will be noticed elsewhere. They in\r\nno respect detract from his reputation. He came nearer than any\r\ncontemporary, except Leonardo da Vinci, to approving himself a\r\nuniversal genius. No man of his time stands higher intellectually, and\r\nhis want of moral elevation is largely redeemed by his ample endowment\r\nwith the one virtue chiefly needful to an Italian in his day, but of\r\nwhich too many Italians were destitute--patriotism.\r\n\r\nPatriotism cannot be denied to Machiavelli’s great counterpart,\r\nFrancesco Guicciardini, and if it seems colder and more stained by\r\nunworthy subserviency and political cynicism, it must be remembered\r\nthat these defects are the defects of the qualities in which\r\nGuicciardini surpassed his rival. Machiavelli was a genius of the\r\ncreative order, and hence, with all his astuteness, occasionally\r\nsomewhat Utopian; his life was free, and his muse licentious.\r\nGuicciardini had a great practical genius, infallible within a narrow\r\nsphere. He does not invent or generalise; his wisdom comes mainly by\r\nexperience, and he accepts things for what they are. “His originality,”\r\nsays Signor Villari, “though doubtless considerable, was devoted to\r\ngiving an exact and most lucid shape to the current doctrines of his\r\nday.” “A sound judgment,” he himself says in his _Ricordi_, “is better\r\nthan a pregnant wit.” He is correct in all the relations of life, and\r\nhas not the least turn for writing comedies. Machiavelli, after all\r\nhis experiences, still hopes like an enchanted maiden for the ideal\r\nprince. Guicciardini knows that there is none such, and that, even\r\nif there were, the barbarians would be too strong for him. He coldly\r\naccepts the situation and hires himself out to a bad Government, with\r\nthis redeeming quality, that it is still a Government of Italians by\r\nItalians. It may be said that Machiavelli was willing to enter the\r\nservice of the Medici, and such is the fact; but Florence had owed\r\nglorious days to Cosmo and Lorenzo, and Machiavelli could never have\r\nthought or written of them as Guicciardini did of his Papal employers:\r\n\r\n“_No one can have a stronger detestation than mine for the avarice,\r\nambition, and sloth of the priesthood. Nevertheless, the position I\r\nhave always held with several pontiffs has compelled me to love them\r\nfor mine own advantage; and but for this consideration I should have\r\nloved Martin Luther as myself, not for the purpose of freeing myself\r\nfrom the laws introduced by the Christian religion, as it is generally\r\ninterpreted and understood, but in order to see this herd of wretches\r\nreduced to their proper condition, namely, that of their being left\r\neither without vices or without authority._”\r\n\r\nIt had not always been so. The Papal satellite had been a trusted\r\nenvoy of the Florentine Government. Born in 1483, he had studied law\r\nat Ferrara and Padua, become an advocate on his return to Florence,\r\nmarried advantageously, and in 1512 discharged a mission to Spain,\r\nwhere he graduated in diplomacy under the eye of the most crafty and\r\nfaithless prince of the Age of Perfidy, Ferdinand the Catholic. The\r\nrevolution which restored the Medici occurred in his absence. He\r\naccepted the situation, but instead of serving the Government at home,\r\npassed into the employment of the Medicean Pope, Leo X., to whom he\r\nmust have been highly recommended, for he immediately received the\r\ngovernment of Modena, Reggio, and Parma, recently added to the states\r\nof the Church, in which he showed the utmost energy and sagacity in\r\nsuppressing malefactors and preserving order. From 1524 to 1527 he was\r\nPresident of the Romagna, and until 1534, when he retired from the\r\nPope’s service, Governor of Bologna, and all evidence goes to show that\r\nthe Papal power was never more faithfully served than by the man who\r\nheld it in such abhorrence. He cannot be acquitted of having favoured\r\nthe overthrow of Florentine liberty in 1530, and is accused of acts of\r\ncupidity and vengeance which do not seem in harmony with his general\r\ncharacter. He returned to his native city in 1534, hoping to play\r\nan important part under the restored dynasty; but the youthful Duke\r\nCosmo, who needed no tutor in the arts of intrigue and dissimulation,\r\ngently thrust him aside, and the disappointed politician solaced his\r\nlatter years with the composition of his history. Six years of literary\r\nleisure gave him a renown which his twenty years of active concern with\r\nthe world’s business would never have procured him. He died in 1540,\r\nleaving his history still in want of the last touches.\r\n\r\nIt is, nevertheless, the leading fault of this very great book to\r\nhave had too many touches already. Guicciardini, like Gibbon, thought\r\nmuch of his dignity, and assumed his historical as poets are said to\r\nassume their singing robes. He dropped the easy and vigorous style\r\nin which his fragment upon Florentine history had been composed in\r\nhis youth, and wrote in a dignified and ambitious manner for which\r\nnature did not qualify him. Hence he is tedious, and the impression of\r\ntameness is enhanced by the unsatisfactory character of the incidents\r\nnarrated, and the author’s general deficiency in enthusiasm. With all\r\nthese defects it is still one of the most valuable histories ever\r\nwritten. It might be entitled the History of the Decline and Fall of\r\nItaly, from the French invasion in 1494. For us the sadness of the\r\npicture is relieved by our knowledge of the splendour of literature and\r\nart in an age of complete dissolution of the body politic; but these\r\nredeeming circumstances do not enter into Guicciardini’s view: he can\r\nonly write as Polybius wrote of the downfall of Greece. He has much in\r\ncommon with this historian: both men of affairs; both largely concerned\r\nwith the events they describe; both embittered by public calamities\r\nand contemptuous of the capacity of their countrymen; both patriotic\r\nchildren of a ruined state, while compelled, and not wholly averse,\r\nto adopt intimate association with the conqueror; neither of them the\r\nmaster of a good style, but compensating this defect by good sense and\r\nthe invaluable political lessons they derive from the transactions they\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nAnother statesman-historian, Ranke, has brought heavy charges against\r\nGuicciardini, both of plagiarism and of wilful manipulation of facts,\r\nbut he seems to have been successfully answered by Signor Villari in\r\nhis Life of Machiavelli. Villari, who has had access to the archives\r\nof Guicciardini’s family, is able to show the extent to which he\r\navailed himself of MS. materials, and his care in working them up into\r\nhis history. Many of his statements which have since been shown to be\r\nerroneous, were in conformity with the general belief of his time.\r\n\r\nGuicciardini’s literary glory was enhanced, though his moral character\r\nsuffered some injury, by the publication of his inedited writings\r\nin ten volumes in 1857 and following years. These include, with\r\nother important matter, the fragment of Florentine history to which\r\nreference has been made; his official correspondence as diplomatist\r\nand governor, full of historical information and practical sagacity;\r\nthe considerations on Machiavelli, his friend and fellow-expert in\r\npolitics, characteristic of the natures of the two men, so eminent\r\nrespectively in theory and in practice; the _Dialogue on the Government\r\nof Florence_, avowing this ostensible partisan of the Medici’s secret\r\npreference for a republic, though an oligarchical one; most important\r\nof all, the _Ricordi politici e civili_, maxims and memoranda of a\r\nstatesman. These are purely aphoristic, without system or unity beyond\r\nthat which they necessarily derive from the constitution of the mind\r\nupon which they have been impressed by experience and reflection.\r\n\r\n“He fully understood,” says Villari, “that by this plan his counsels\r\nand political maxims became nothing more than simple observations,\r\npalliatives and tricks for the wiser or less wise guidance of the\r\nsocial machine, apart from all radical reform or the creation of any\r\nnew system of political science or moral philosophy, and still less\r\nof any new state or new people. But he neither hoped nor desired to\r\nentertain hopes of so lofty a nature. System he did not seek, daring\r\nhypotheses were not to his taste; he merely gathered the fruit of\r\nhis own and others’ daily experience.” In a word, Guicciardini was a\r\nrealist; Machiavelli, for all his worldly wisdom, an idealist. As the\r\nBishop of London has remarked: “It is the weakness of Machiavelli’s\r\npolitical method that, while professing to deal with politics in\r\na practical spirit, he is not practical enough.” It would seem\r\nGuicciardini’s chief fault to have taken too limited a view of human\r\naffairs, and to have judged too exclusively from what was happening\r\nin his own corner. The imperfection of historical materials, however,\r\nrendered any attempt at a philosophy of history extremely difficult,\r\nand Guicciardini’s time was too much occupied by administrative labours\r\nfor profound investigation. Notwithstanding his opportunism and\r\npolitical pessimism, he had an ideal, and he tells us plainly what it\r\nwas:\r\n\r\n“_I desire to see three things before my death--but I doubt I may live\r\nlong enough without seeing any of them--a well-ordered republican mode\r\nof life in our own city, the deliverance of Italy from all barbarians,\r\nand the world freed from the tyranny of these execrable priests._”\r\n\r\nThe mutability of the world might almost seem to justify\r\nGuicciardini’s hand-to-mouth method of getting through it. We have seen\r\nPetrarch two centuries earlier calling for the Pope’s return to Rome as\r\nthe panacea for all the ills of Italy. Guicciardini would have sided\r\nwith him in that age; in his own the same genius of liberty which spoke\r\nby Petrarch’s mouth to demand the Pope’s restoration speaks by his to\r\ndemand the Pope’s expulsion. It was not given to him to see the great\r\nvalue in evil times of the temporal power--in good times monstrous--as\r\nan asylum for what little of independence could still subsist in\r\nItaly, and a testimony, however feeble, to a moral and spiritual unity\r\ndestined to develop into a national unity. But against the Papal sway\r\non its own merits, apart from the accidental circumstances of the time,\r\nGuicciardini and Machiavelli prophesy like the two witnesses of the\r\nApocalypse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII\r\n             OTHER PROSE-WRITERS OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nItaly now possessed a perfect standard of prose. She had already had\r\none in the fourteenth century, when so rapid had been the development\r\nof the power of expression that the form had outrun the substance. She\r\ncould say anything; but except by the mouth of the novelist Boccaccio,\r\nand that of Petrarch, who preferred to write his prose in Latin, had\r\nfound little worthy of emphatic utterance. It may be partly owing to\r\nthis poverty of matter in the vernacular literature, as well as to the\r\npassion for Latin, that style decayed so greatly during the fifteenth\r\ncentury. Yet, so far as the latter of these causes operated, the evil\r\nbrought its own remedy: it was impossible to be as deeply versed\r\nas Pontano or Politian in the elegances of Latin without becoming\r\nimpatient of barbarism and pedantry in Italian. Sannazaro, an exquisite\r\nLatin writer, was perhaps the first considerable man who insisted\r\non an even standard of distinction in both languages. Fortunately\r\nfor Italy, the _Arcadia_ was a very popular book; fortunately, too,\r\nthe Latin constructions with which it is replete were not so easily\r\nimitated as its general refinement of phrase. By the time of Leo X.\r\ninelegance had almost disappeared from Italian literature, and Italy\r\nmight boast herself the only country in Europe that possessed a perfect\r\nliterary language; wanting, indeed, the golden simplicity of the\r\nthirteenth century, but still the prose of cultivated men, and adequate\r\nfor every form of literary composition. The intellectual distinction\r\nthus conferred upon the nation, combined with her still more\r\npronounced superiority in the arts, seemed, as with Greece in similar\r\ncircumstances, to regain for her a dominion more illustrious than that\r\nof which she had been despoiled. For a hundred years her authors were\r\nthe arbiters of taste and the models of Europe, a sovereignty which\r\nmight have been prolonged had it been possible for her to place herself\r\non the right and victorious side in the great battle for civil and\r\nreligious freedom that resounded throughout the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nAs in all countries at their first awakening to an era of literary\r\nculture, this culture had gone deep enough to produce a multitude of\r\nauthors, but not deep enough to generate a literary public capable of\r\nsupporting them. The appetite for fame and the delight in authorship\r\nfilled the ranks of literature with aspiring recruits, but the\r\ncommissariat, without which no army can keep the field, had to be\r\nsupplied by patronage, either from individuals or the state. Hence,\r\nexcept when some wealthy noble like Angelo di Costanzo was smitten\r\nwith the passion for literary fame, we usually find the writers of\r\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, even when most illustrious,\r\nin a condition of dependence. When with this is considered the utter\r\nabsence of civil freedom (for Venice, the one free city, hospitable to\r\nauthors, allowed little liberty to printers), it is remarkable that\r\nthe servility of the writers should have extended so little beyond\r\ntheir dedications. Especially is this the case with history, which,\r\nnotwithstanding the influences at work to disfigure and corrupt it,\r\nremained on the whole surprisingly impartial. This must be ascribed in\r\ngreat part to the influence of classic models; partly, also, to the\r\nreal mental superiority of most of those who in the sixteenth century\r\nessayed this form of composition.\r\n\r\nNo form is more attractive than the historical to men ambitious to\r\nshine in letters, and conscious of high talent without creative genius.\r\n“_No merita il nome di creatore, se non Iddio ed il Poeta_;” but\r\ndelineation of character and representation of events are as it were\r\nan inferior kind of creation out of pre-existing material, like that\r\nascribed by ancient theology to the Demiurgus. The literary genius\r\nof Italy addressed itself eagerly to the task. Ere long almost every\r\nconsiderable state had its vernacular historian. Some of the most\r\nimportant writers, nevertheless, continued to compose in Latin. Among\r\nthese the most eminent was that very secular prelate and not very\r\ntrustworthy historian PAOLO GIOVIO, Bishop of Nocera (1483-1552), one\r\nof the men whose chief title to fame in our day is to have been famous\r\nin their own, but who was certainly reckoned as the chief historian\r\nof his time, and whose biographies of eminent men of letters and\r\nillustrious captains are still found valuable. Part of his general\r\nhistory of his own times perished in the sack of Rome (1527), and, with\r\na sensitiveness not dishonourable to him, he shrank from recording\r\nthe transactions of a time when the vials of wrath seemed so visibly\r\npoured out upon the Papacy. Except for the gaps indicated, his history\r\nextends from 1494 to 1547. Literature sustained a heavy loss in the\r\ndisappearance of the work of Andrea Navagero, another Latin historian\r\n(1483-1529), who had been entrusted by the Venetian Government with\r\nthe history of their Republic. The loss of another historian--Girolamo\r\nBorgia, who wrote the history of Italy in the days of Alexander VI. and\r\nJulius II.--is greatly to be deplored, not because he was distinguished\r\nas a writer, but because he was a Borgia.\r\n\r\nThe historian of Florence had given the first example of really\r\nclassic Italian history, and Florence, though backward in comparison\r\nwith Venice in the diffusion of literature by the art of printing,\r\nstill took the lead among Italian cities in literary as well as\r\nartistic cultivation. A group of Florentine annalists sprung up, whose\r\npens were chiefly exerted for the honour of their birthplace. Their\r\ncandour generally prevented the publication of their works in their\r\nlifetime. Such is the case with JACOPO NARDI, who wrote the history\r\nof Florence from the expulsion of the Medici in 1494 to their final\r\nrestoration in 1530, “with sincerity of intention and painstaking\r\naccuracy” (Symonds), but also with the acrimony to be expected from\r\na banished patriot who fought for liberty to the last, and for the\r\nremainder of his life ate the bread of exile at Venice. The style is\r\naccused of aridity; but his translation of Livy is regarded as one of\r\nthe best in the Italian language. His own history was not published\r\nuntil 1582, nor that of his continuator Segni until 1713, although\r\nthis elegant historian, whose work occupies the period from 1527 to\r\n1555, was a partisan of the Medici. A portion of the same epoch, from\r\n1527 to 1538, is described much more diffusely by BENEDETTO VARCHI,\r\none of the most prolific men of letters of his time. Varchi, though\r\na devotee of the liberty of whose restoration he despaired, wrote by\r\nthe special commission of the Grand Duke Cosmo, which neither affected\r\nhis impartiality nor protected him from being nearly murdered by some\r\nprivate persons who had been offended by his honesty, nor prevented his\r\nhistory from remaining in MS. until the eighteenth century. In 1570\r\nSCIPIONE AMMIRATO, a Neapolitan, received a commission from the Grand\r\nDuke to write a general history of Florence, which he brought down to\r\n1574. His free access to archives enabled him to be more accurate than\r\nany predecessor. He also compiled some valuable genealogical works. The\r\nhistory of Ferrara was written by Pigna, and that of Genoa by Foglietta\r\nand Bonfadio, all of whom may be considered standard historians. The\r\nsame can hardly be said of any other of the numerous local writers\r\nwhom Italy produced in this age, except Porzio, the historian of the\r\nconspiracy of the Neapolitan barons against King Ferdinand; Graziani,\r\nwho recounted the Venetian wars in Cyprus; and three others who deserve\r\nnotice not merely as historians but as typical figures.\r\n\r\nNever since Petrarch’s day had the sceptre of Italian literature\r\nrested so unequivocally in one hand as in PIETRO BEMBO’S during the\r\nsecond quarter of the sixteenth century. In one respect Bembo’s\r\npre-eminence is even more remarkable than his predecessor’s, for\r\nPetrarch towered immeasurably above any possible competitor except\r\nBoccaccio, while Bembo was so far from being the first man of his day\r\nthat he was not even a man of genius. His wonderful gift for felicitous\r\nimitation, whether in prose or verse, was unaccompanied by any power of\r\noriginal thought. But he possessed beyond any contemporary the formal\r\nperfection of style, whether in Latin or Italian, demanded by the age.\r\nHis History of Venice, which alone concerns us here, was originally\r\npublished in the former language, but Bembo vindicated his claim to a\r\nplace among Italian historians by himself translating it into Italian.\r\nHe had succeeded Andrea Navagero as Venetian historiographer in 1529.\r\n\r\nBorn at Venice in 1470, and son of the magistrate who so honourably\r\ndistinguished himself by raising a monument to Dante at Ravenna, Bembo\r\nhad all his life enjoyed the favour of the great. He had been the\r\nPlatonic admirer of Lucrezia Borgia, who had honoured him with the\r\nshining tress and the dull letters religiously preserved in the Brera\r\nLibrary at Milan. Leo X. had made him his secretary before issuing\r\nfrom his own conclave, and, with munificence for once well applied,\r\nhad provided him with means to occupy a delicious retreat at Padua,\r\nwhere he was residing when he received the Venetian commission. At a\r\nlater period Paul III., who loved to surround himself with illustrious\r\nmen, raised him to the Cardinalate and drew him to Rome, where he\r\ndied in 1547, more admired and lamented than any man of letters of\r\nhis time. His history, which extends from 1487 to 1513, and which he\r\ncomposed with his eye upon Cæsar, is the image of the writer, perfect\r\nin the harmony of its periods, and carrying the reader rapidly along\r\nits smooth surface, but surface alone, describing every occurrence as\r\nthe ordinary man saw it and the statesman did not, with no attempt to\r\nsearch out the secret springs of action, no reference to documents\r\npublic or private, and, which is more surprising, no effort to\r\ndelineate a remarkable character. That this would not have exceeded his\r\npowers is shown by his beautiful portrait of the Duchess of Urbino, in\r\nhis Latin life of her husband.\r\n\r\nBembo’s successor, PIETRO PARUTA (1540-98), who continued his history\r\nto 1551, typifies the statesman historian, versed in diplomacy and\r\npublic business, and so highly endowed with the qualifications demanded\r\nby such employments as to have become Procurator of the Republic, and\r\nto have been prevented only by his death from becoming Doge. He was\r\nconsequently well fitted to write the annals of a state like Venice,\r\nand his work stands high among Italian histories. The third exceptional\r\nhistorian of the age, typical of the accomplished literary amateur, is\r\nANGELO DI COSTANZO, a Neapolitan noble whom we shall meet again among\r\nthe poets. He wrote the history of Naples from 1250 to 1486, and is\r\ninteresting as the pupil of Sannazaro, the friend of Vittoria Colonna,\r\na patrician whose love of letters led him to cultivate authorship, and\r\na patriot whose love of country gave umbrage to the jealous Spanish\r\nviceroy, and subjected him to perpetual confinement to his estates. His\r\nhistory does not disappoint the favourable prepossessions thus aroused,\r\nbeing composed with great elegance and dignity, and a manifest love\r\nof truth; insomuch that the author of the modern standard history of\r\nNaples, Giannone, while supplying Costanzo’s defects by close attention\r\nto jurisprudence, public economy, and other subjects neglected by his\r\npredecessor, has transfused most of the latter’s narrative into his own.\r\n\r\nBiography, the most attractive form of prose composition, was also\r\nwell represented in this age, but inspired only two standard works,\r\nextremely unlike in style and spirit, but both possessions for all\r\ntime, and both relating to the line arts. GIORGIO VASARI (1512-74),\r\nbiographer-general of painters, sculptors, and architects, may be\r\ncalled the Herodotus of art; a practitioner himself, and acquainted\r\nwith many of the persons whom he describes; lively and garrulous,\r\napparently most artless, he possesses either the science or the knack\r\nof felicitous composition in an extraordinary degree. Living when\r\npicturesque stories about artists were accepted without question, he\r\nis entirely unembarrassed in relating such as commend themselves to\r\nhim, to the joy of the readers and the scandal of the critics of the\r\nfuture. It is probable that scepticism of the truth of his anecdotes\r\nand the authority due to his attributions of pictures has gone much too\r\nfar; but however this may be, criticism will never be able to turn his\r\nliving book into a dead one, or to invalidate our debt to him for the\r\nmass of unquestionably authentic particulars which he has preserved.\r\nHis good taste in art as well as in literature is evinced by his\r\nadmiration for the first-fruits of the early Tuscan school, neglected\r\nin his day, and his character appears throughout his work in the most\r\namiable light. His chief defect, a serious one, is the imperfection of\r\nhis information respecting the important schools of Lombardy and Venice.\r\n\r\nThere is little amiability in a still more distinguished writer, whose\r\npen has gained him the immortality which he expected from the chisel\r\nand the graver. BENVENUTO CELLINI (1501-71) was undoubtedly a very\r\neminent artist; yet the autobiography which has preserved his name,\r\nwhile those of Pompeo Tarcone and Alessandro Cesati are forgotten, is\r\na greater work of art than any he accomplished in his own vocation. It\r\nmay be compared to the realistic sculpture of Donatello, surpassing\r\nin vigour and animation the ideal models of which it falls short in\r\nelegance and grace. It is the counterpart of a man, and a very manly\r\nman, all muscle and sinew and rude force, a boaster, a bully, a\r\nlibertine, a duellist, almost an assassin, one whom a slight change of\r\ncircumstances would easily have made a brigand or a bravo but always\r\nthe artist. No book, it is probable, gives a better idea of the general\r\natmosphere of the Italy of the sixteenth century; assuredly no other\r\ndelineation is nearly so vivid. With truly Pepysian unconsciousness\r\nthe writer depicts in himself the man of turbulent and impracticable\r\ncharacter moving among princes and nobles, outraging their forbearance\r\nby every action of his life, and revenging himself for their exhausted\r\npatience by malicious truth or reckless calumny. The general fidelity\r\nof the picture, however, does not depend upon the accuracy of\r\nparticular statements, and Cellini’s untruths where his own vanity is\r\nconcerned do not impair his claim to confidence as a delineator of his\r\nage. Of the literary merit of his performance it is needless to speak;\r\nif not at the very head of entertaining autobiographies, it is at least\r\nsecond to none. The English reader will be continually reminded of\r\nHaydon; although, however, Haydon’s confidence in himself was no less\r\nrobust than Cellini’s, he had far less reason for it, nor, with all his\r\nvividness, is he the Italian’s equal in graphic power.\r\n\r\nOne other prose-writer of the period, and perhaps only one, may be\r\nconsidered as much an author for all time as Vasari and Cellini. This\r\nis BALDASSARE CASTIGLIONE, whose _Cortegiano_ depicts the ideal life\r\nof the accomplished Italian courtier--a character of more importance\r\nin that day than he can be in ours. In Castiglione’s time not only\r\nwere the court and good society almost convertible expressions, but\r\nthe relation of the courtier to the court was far more intimate than\r\nit can be now. It actually was his sphere, which he seldom forsook\r\nexcept when absent on military enterprises or public business; he\r\nwas in habits of daily intercourse with his sovereign, and professed\r\ncourtesy and civility as others professed arts or trades. A competent\r\nwriter on the court and its accomplishments, therefore, was necessarily\r\nan instructor in manners and refinement, and as such might exercise an\r\nimportant influence on his age. While the equally accomplished Casa,\r\nin his _Galateo_, instructed the average gentleman in good manners,\r\nthe courtier’s training fell to the lot of Castiglione, than whom no\r\nman could be better qualified either by actual disposition or the\r\ncircumstances of his life. A Mantuan by birth, he had served the Duke\r\nof Urbino, had exemplified Italian refinement at the English court on\r\na mission to receive the Garter for his sovereign, and when he wrote\r\n(1518), was envoy at the court of Leo X., and the intimate friend of\r\nthe most cultivated men of his age.\r\n\r\nThe machinery of his book is a report, imaginary in form, but\r\nfaithful in spirit, of dialogues held at the court of Urbino among the\r\ndistinguished persons who frequented it at various times. They are by\r\nno means frivolous; Castiglione’s standard, not merely of deportment\r\nand manly exercise, but of intellectual accomplishment, is very high.\r\nThe conversations deal with such themes as the preferable form of\r\ngovernment and the condition of women, and are handled with signal\r\nelegance, acumen, and graceful but not cumbrous erudition. They are\r\ninterspersed with pleasant stories admirably told, and would give a\r\nfascinating idea of Italian court life, were it not so evident that\r\nits darker features have been kept out of view, and that the general\r\nrelation of Castiglione’s picture to reality is that of Sannazaro’s\r\nArcadia to the actual life of shepherds. Yet the picture has many\r\nelements of truth, and it speaks well for the age that it could\r\nproduce even such an ideal. “Carried to the north of Europe,” says Mr.\r\nCourthope, “and grafted on the still chivalrous manners of the English\r\naristocracy, the ideal of Castiglione contributed to form the character\r\nof Sir Philip Sidney.” The delicacy of Castiglione’s sentiments is\r\nshown by his bitter mortification at the unjust reproaches of Clement\r\nVII., into whose service he afterwards entered, and who accused him of\r\nfailure as a diplomatist. These are said to have broken his heart. He\r\ndied in 1529. Raphael had painted his portrait, his tomb was designed\r\nby Giulio Romano, and his epitaph was written by Bembo.\r\n\r\n“Love rules the court, the camp, the grove.” The _Asolani_ of Bembo,\r\ntherefore, a disquisition on Love from different points of view,\r\ncomposed in imitation of Cicero’s Tusculan Questions, should take\r\nprecedence of Castiglione’s _Cortegiano_, but it can hardly be said\r\nthat it does. The _Cortegiano_ is a piece of real life, indicating, if\r\nnot precisely what the highest Italian society was, at all events what\r\nit felt it ought to be. Bembo’s dialogues, or rather monologues, might\r\nhave been composed in any age of refinement; they are purely academical\r\nin form, and the perpetual justice of the sentiments is purchased by\r\nperpetual commonplace. Seldom, however, have commonplaces been set\r\noff with such harmony and polish of style, or with more ingenious\r\neloquence, especially at the conclusion, where the Hermit reconciles\r\nLove’s advocates and his accusers by descanting on the charms of ideal\r\nbeauty. If it be true that to have read it was the indispensable\r\npassport to good society, the circumstance is creditable to the age’s\r\nliterary taste, and still more so to its standard of ideal excellence.\r\nBembo’s prose is more satisfactory than his poetry, perhaps because\r\nit raises less expectation; in verse the wonder is that he attains no\r\nfurther, and in prose that he attains so far. _Gli Asolani_, first\r\npublished in 1505, was written at the age of twenty-eight, and was\r\ndedicated to Lucrezia Borgia. On the strength of it Bembo is made the\r\nchief interlocutor in Castiglione’s _Cortegiano_ when the question of\r\nlove is touched upon.\r\n\r\nThe number of writers at this period who, if not always moral, may be\r\ndescribed as moralists, is very considerable. ALESSANDRO PICCOLOMINI,\r\nafterwards Archbishop of Patras, wrote a complete institution of the\r\ncitizen which is not devoid of merit; but he is better remembered by\r\na sin of his youth, the _Dialogo della bella creauza delle donne_,\r\nin which an Italian Martha successfully exhorts an Italian Margaret\r\nto add a lover to a husband. The literary merits of this otherwise\r\nreprehensible performance are considerable; it is also an authority\r\non cosmetics. Sperone Speroni, eminent for the dignity of his life\r\nand the elegance of his style, has the further honour of having first\r\nemployed the dialogue in the discussion of purely ethical questions.\r\nLodovico Dolce and A. F. Doni, industrious _littérateurs_, obtained\r\na reputation in their own day which posterity has not ratified. The\r\nformer, says Tiraboschi, wrote much in every style and well in none;\r\nthe latter is tersely characterised by Niceron as “grand diseur de\r\nriens.” Far superior is GIOVANNI BATTISTA GELLI, the learned tailor of\r\nFlorence, who had the great advantage over the other moralists of being\r\nable to clothe his wit and wisdom in an objective form. In his _Circe_,\r\nUlysses is represented as unsuccessfully endeavouring to persuade his\r\nmetamorphosed companions to reassume human shape. They know better, and\r\ntheir argumentation might well have suggested the machinery of Dryden’s\r\n_Hind and Panther_; even as that of Gelli’s _Capricci_, where Giusto\r\ndisputes with his own soul, was very probably copied in Smollett’s\r\n_Adventures of an Atom_.\r\n\r\nOne of the most characteristic writers of the time is AGNOLO\r\nFIRENZUOLA (1497-1547), an authority “on the form and colour of the\r\near, and the proper way of wearing ornamental flowers,” whose elegant\r\nand frequently licentious stories, idiomatically Tuscan in style,\r\nfresh in humour, and brilliant in description, are interwoven with his\r\n_Dialoghi d’Amore_, and who also gained fame by his comedies, and as\r\nthe translator, or rather adapter, of Apuleius. As the combination of\r\nthe photographic portraits of several members of any class of society\r\ngives the mean average of its physiognomy, so Firenzuola represents the\r\naverage constitution of such men of letters of his day as wrote with a\r\nreal vocation for literature. It is doubtful whether any such vocation\r\ncan be credited to another satirist who greatly surpassed him in\r\ncelebrity, the notorious PIETRO ARETINO (1492-1556). Aretino was merely\r\na literary blackmailer, whose profligate and venal pen was employed to\r\nextort or cajole money from the great men of the age. His indubitable\r\nsuccess is difficult to understand, except as the irrepressible and\r\nirreversible decree of fashion. Apart from his comedies and his\r\nletters, an amazing record of the abasement of rank before impudence,\r\nonly one of his works has any literary merit, and the genuineness of\r\nthis is questionable. His other immoralities are as insipid as his\r\nmoralities, and his personalities are of the kind best answered by a\r\ncudgel. Notwithstanding, he became a power in public life as well as in\r\nliterature, rivalled the opulence and the pomp of his friend Titian,\r\nand, like him, trained up disciples of his craft. The charm may have\r\nlain in some measure in the boldness of the man, who alone in his age\r\nmade a show of free speech, although the real motor of his pen was\r\ncupidity, who lived libelling, and died laughing. Worthless as he was,\r\nhe might have anticipated Pope’s boast that men not afraid of God were\r\nafraid of him.\r\n\r\nAretino is only one among a host of letter-writers, who included\r\nthe most accomplished men of the age. Bembo appears as its typical\r\nrepresentative, here as elsewhere, although the unfortunate historian\r\nBonfadio is held to have written best. All wrote with an eye to the\r\npublication of their epistles, and asked themselves what Cicero\r\nwould have said in their place. None had the delightful candour\r\nand exuberance of Petrarch; they are in consequence much less\r\nnational, interesting, and human; and their letters, stripped of\r\nthe complimentary phrases which eke them out, are in general brief.\r\nYet it would be hard to refuse any among them the praise due to two\r\nexcellent qualities, good style and good sense. Such were the general\r\ncharacteristics of the age, a period, but for Ariosto, almost devoid of\r\ncreative power in letters, yet fully worthy to be ranked with the other\r\ngreat eras of artificial literature, the eras of Augustus, and Anne,\r\nand Louis XIV. Its truest praise is perhaps afforded by a comparison of\r\nit with the other contemporary literatures of Europe, then, the French\r\nexcepted, which is immensely indebted to the Italian, almost equally\r\ndestitute of genius and of art, although the magnificent rhythm of\r\nEnglish prose even then showed what an instrument had been provided for\r\nperformers yet to come. But temporal and spiritual tyranny were fast\r\ndestroying the elementary requisites of great literature in Italy. The\r\nhare was lamed, and the tortoises were overtaking her. A little while\r\nyet, and it would be needful to look beyond Alp and sea for the true\r\nItaly, and find her in the bosoms of Shakespeare, Spenser, and Sidney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n                           THE PETRARCHISTS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the definite result of the literary ferment which\r\naccompanied the revival of vernacular Italian literature after the\r\nlong torpor of the fifteenth century was the recognition of literary\r\nform, rather than intellectual substance, as the principal object of\r\ncultivation, a conclusion completely in harmony with the national\r\ngenius as well as the national traditions. Had this been otherwise,\r\nrevolt would soon have made itself evident. On the contrary, however,\r\nwe meet with scarcely any manifestation of the existence of a romantic\r\nspirit in Italian literature until Manzoni begins to be inspired by\r\nScott and Byron, and Foscolo by Rousseau. The consequence is a great\r\nlack of richness and variety in comparison with a literature like\r\nthe English, where all descriptions of tendencies have been allowed\r\nample scope, and now one, now another, has successively seemed to be\r\npredominant; but none, except now and then for a time, has attained an\r\nabsolute mastery.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the devotion of the Italian writers to elegance\r\nand symmetry of composition has rendered their literature a model for\r\ncultured writers in all languages, has deeply influenced contemporary\r\nliteratures in their rudimentary stages, and has preserved many a\r\nwriter from oblivion whose original power was not conspicuous, whose\r\nthemes have long since become antiquated, but who still challenges the\r\nattention of posterity by charm of style. “Cela qui n’est pas écrit\r\nne dure pas” is a rule without exception, and the converse is often,\r\nthough not always, true also. One highly important class of these\r\nwriters is that large section of the poets who modelled themselves\r\navowedly on the greatest master of style their literature possessed or\r\npossesses, the man whose thoughts, often most precious in themselves,\r\nare displayed to incomparable advantage by incomparable felicity of\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nVery few Italian lyrical poets of the sixteenth century ventured to\r\nstray far from the traces of Petrarch, who became to them what Virgil\r\nand Homer and Ovid had necessarily become to writers in Latin verse.\r\nHad Petrarch excelled in epic as he excelled in lyric, Ariosto and\r\nTasso too would have been his humble followers, and the whole of\r\nthe poetical literature of the age would have been imitative, and\r\nconsequently second-rate. Yet, although the mass of this derivative\r\nliterature is intolerably empty and insipid, much is distinguished by a\r\nperfection of expression which makes it not merely delightful reading\r\nbut a valuable study. The poets frequently seem to approach Petrarch\r\nvery nearly, but none reproduce him. Those succeed best whose imitation\r\nis the least avowed, and who are most remote from their model in native\r\ntemperament, such as Tansillo; on the other hand, Bembo, Molza, and\r\ntheir like, who in mere form have most nearly approached Petrarch by\r\nmost completely suppressing their own individuality, present much less\r\nto interest modern readers, although their contemporaries, estimating\r\nthem from another point of view, extolled them to the skies.\r\n\r\nBembo and Molza, nevertheless, only followed in the track of the\r\ngifted man whom we have already seen so influential in the development\r\nof Italian prose--Jacopo Sannazaro. Sannazaro’s attention was, indeed,\r\nprincipally given to Latin poetry. But the qualifications of an\r\neminent Latinist and of a pattern Petrarchist were much the same. Both\r\nabdicated all claim to originality by setting before themselves a model\r\nwhich it was taken for granted--and with justice--that they would be\r\nfor ever unable to rival. Sannazaro was, notwithstanding, something\r\nmore than a master of felicitous expression. His Virgilian _De Partu\r\nVirginis_, in which he vied with the chief contemporary writers of\r\nLatin hexameters, Vida and Fracastoro, is less attractive than his\r\nelegies, into which he has introduced more of personal feeling, or his\r\nPiscatorian Eclogues, in which he has successfully revived the form, if\r\nnot the spirit, of ancient composition, and from which Milton did not\r\ndisdain to borrow ornaments for _Lycidas_. As a follower of Petrarch,\r\nSannazaro stands on a different footing from Bembo and Molza. Their\r\nexcellence in their own way is indisputable, but monotonous: they\r\nneither rise nor sink; every poem of theirs is just as good as every\r\nother poem. Sannazaro, a man of noble character and strong feeling,\r\nimports a personal note into his poetry, and succeeds in proportion\r\nto the clearness with which he can render this audible. His praise of\r\nPetrarch’s Laura, for instance, is something more than conventionality,\r\nand these lines, _Mors et Vita_, translated by Glassford, express the\r\nsum of much serious meditation:\r\n\r\n      _Alas! when I behold this empty show\r\n        Of life, and think how soon it shall have fled;\r\n        When I consider how the honoured head\r\n      is daily struck by death’s mysterious blow,\r\n      My heart is wasted like the melting snow,\r\n        And hope, that comforter, is nearly dead;\r\n        Seeing these wings have been so long outspread,\r\n      And yet so sluggish is my flight and low.\r\n      But if I therefore should complain and weep--\r\n        If chide with love, or fortune, or the fair--\r\n        No cause I have; myself must bear it all,\r\n      Who, like a man 'mid trifles lulled to sleep,\r\n        With death beside me, feed on empty air,\r\n        Nor think how soon this mouldering garb must fall._\r\n\r\nAmong Sannazaro’s contemporaries, a little too early to have imbibed\r\nthe full spirit of the Petrarchan revival, may be especially named\r\nAntonio Tebaldeo (1463-1537), an admired poet who survived his\r\nreputation; Serafino dell’ Aquila, imitated by Wyat, whose Neapolitan\r\nvehemence betrayed his lively talent into bombast; Antonio Cammelli,\r\nthe political laureate of the Ferrarese court; Antonello Petrucci, who\r\nwrote as Damocles banqueted, with the headsman’s axe suspended over\r\nhim; Notturno Neapolitano; and Filosseno, chiefly remarkable for the\r\nundisguised gallantry of his sonnets addressed to Lucrezia Borgia.\r\n\r\nBembo was a model man of letters, to whom in this capacity the Italian\r\nlanguage and Italian culture are infinitely beholden. As a poet he is\r\nperhaps best characterised by the forty drawers through which he is\r\nsaid to have successively passed his sonnets, making some alteration\r\nfor the better in every one of them. If there had been any originality\r\nin any of them, this would hardly have survived the twentieth drawer,\r\nbut there never had been, and since the polish was always meant to be\r\nthe merit, there hardly could be too much polishing. Bembo’s poetry at\r\nall events serves to refute the heresy which identities genius with\r\nindustry; and if we admit with Roscoe that “any person of good taste\r\nand extensive reading might, _by a due portion of labour_, produce\r\nworks of equal merit,” we must nevertheless allow that it will probably\r\nbe long ere such a capacity for labour reappears. He entirely fulfilled\r\nthe requirements of his own age, by which he was simply idolised.\r\nThe quintessence of his contemporaries’ admiration is concentrated\r\nin Vittoria Colonna’s humble yet dignified remonstrance with him for\r\nhaving failed to celebrate the death of her husband:\r\n\r\n      _Unkind was Fate, prohibiting the rays\r\n        Of my great Sun your kindling soul to smite;\r\n        For thus in perpetuity more bright\r\n      Your fame had been, more glorious his praise.\r\n      His memory, exalted in your lays,\r\n        That ancient times obscure, and ours delight,\r\n        Had 'scaped in fell Oblivion’s despite\r\n      The second death, that on the spirit preys.\r\n      If in your bosom might infusèd be\r\n        My ardour, or my pen as yours inspired,\r\n        Great as the dead should be the elegy.\r\n      But now I fear lest Heaven with wrath be fired;\r\n        Toward you, for overmuch humility;\r\n        Toward me, who have too daringly aspired._\r\n\r\nBembo’s Latin poetry, of which charming specimens may be seen in\r\nSymonds’s _Renaissance_, is better than his Italian, for it does not\r\ndisappoint. The fame of FRANCESCO MARIA MOLZA (1489-1544) was in his\r\nday hardly second to Bembo’s, and was based on much the same grounds.\r\nLike Bembo, he was an elegant Latin poet, who carried the maxims\r\nappropriate for composition in a dead language into a living one.\r\nLike Bembo’s, his vernacular poems, with one remarkable exception,\r\nare models of diction as inexpressive as harmonious--a perpetual\r\nsilvery chime which soothes the ear, but conveys nothing to the mind.\r\nThe exception is a poem in which the usual vagueness and emptiness\r\nof sentiment assumes substance from its pastoral setting. The _Ninfa\r\nTiberina_, in which one of Molza’s innumerable light loves is idealised\r\nas a shepherdess, is just such a piece of mosaic as Gray’s Elegy.\r\nThe author has amassed all the commonplaces of pastoral poetry, and,\r\nwithout adding a single idea of his own, has combined them into so\r\nrich and glowing a picture that he may well claim to have superseded\r\nthe entire school of pastoral versifiers, the few excepted who have\r\nderived their inspiration from Nature, like his predecessor Politian.\r\n“Molza is to Politian,” says Symonds, “as the rose to the rosebud.” He\r\nwas born at Modena, but lived chiefly at Rome, leaving his wife and\r\nfamily in his native city. They would indeed have been much in the\r\nway, for he was continually involved in some amour, and his irregular\r\nties ultimately proved fatal to him. He was a leading member of the\r\nbrilliant literary circles of Rome and Florence, and as a companion and\r\na man of letters his contemporaries have nothing but praise for him.\r\n\r\nPetrarch is a poet as much within the scope of imitation as beyond\r\nthe pursuit of rivalry. The swarms of Petrarchists stun the ear and\r\ndarken the light of the period: Tansillo might well say that every\r\nhillock had grown a Parnassus. They may be found in the thesaurus of\r\nDolce, a series whose continuous publication for so many years at all\r\nevents affords proof that this appetite for imitative verse was not\r\nfactitious. Some few stand forth from the crowd by some exceptional\r\ncharacteristics, and it is of these only that we can speak. The first\r\nof these in chronological order is BERNARDO TASSO (1493-1568), whom\r\nwe have already met as the author of the _Amadigi_. In his lyrical as\r\nin his epical attempts, Tasso is one of those provoking poets who are\r\nalways trembling on the verge of excellence, ever good, hardly ever\r\nquite good enough. Even the famous sonnet on his renunciation of his\r\nlady, which, Dolce tells us, thrilled Italy, is less eminent for the\r\nbeauty of the poetry than the nobility of the sentiment. Once, however,\r\nstraying within the domain of pastoral poetry, he found and polished a\r\ngem worthy of the Greek Anthology:\r\n\r\n      _The herb and floweret of my verdant shore,\r\n        Shepherd, thy pasturing flock’s possession be;\r\n        And thine the olive and the mulberry\r\n      That mantle these fair hillocks o’er and o’er.\r\n      But be my fountain’s fresh and sparkling store\r\n        Of gushing waters undisturbed by thee,\r\n        For they are vowed to Muses’ ministry,\r\n      And whoso drinks is poet evermore.\r\n      Solely for these and for Apollo fit,\r\n        And Loves and Nymphs the sacred stream doth burst,\r\n        Or haply some fair swan may drink of it;\r\n      But thou, if not a swain untutored, first\r\n        Thy dues to Love in melody acquit,\r\n        Then with the bubbling coolness quench thy thirst._\r\n\r\nAnother poet of the time vies with Bernardo Tasso in nobility of\r\ncharacter, evinced in his case by the fervour of his patriotism.\r\nThe bulk of the verse of GUIDO GUIDICCIONI, Bishop of Fossombrone\r\n(1500-41), consists of insipid love-strains in the style of Bembo and\r\nMolza; but when he touches upon the wrongs and misfortunes of his\r\ncountry he becomes inspired, and speaks in tones of alternate majesty\r\nand pathos, to which the following sonnet superadds the charms of fancy:\r\n\r\n      _The Arno and the Tiber and the Po\r\n        This sad lament and heavy plaint of mine\r\n        I hear, for solely I my ear incline,\r\n      Accompany with music sad and low.\r\n      No more Heaven’s light on sunny wave doth glow,\r\n        No more the dwindled lamps of virtue shine;\r\n        Dark western tempests, dank and foul with brine,\r\n      Have swept the meads and laid the flowerets low.\r\n      The myrtle, Rivers, and the laurel-spray,\r\n        Delight and diadem of chosen souls,\r\n        And sacred shrines the blast hath borne away;\r\n      No more unto the sea your torrent rolls\r\n        Exulting, or your Naiades display\r\n        Their snowy breasts and shining aureoles._\r\n\r\nIf other Italian poets felt like Guidiccioni, they shunned to give\r\ntheir sentiments utterance. The chief original poem of ANNIBALE CARO\r\n(1507-66), the accomplished translator of Virgil and Longus, and one\r\nof the best letter-writers of his age, was a panegyric on the house of\r\nValois--_Venite all’ombra dei gran gigli d’oro_ (“_Hither, where spread\r\nthe golden fleurs-de-lis_”). A few years later, with equal genius and\r\nequal insensibility to the part that became an Italian, Caro turned to\r\ncelebrate the Spanish conqueror. Whatever may be thought of the theme\r\nof his poem, it is in execution one of the great things of Italian\r\npoetry:\r\n\r\n      _Here the Fifth Charles reposes, at whose name\r\n        Eyes of superbest monarchs seek the ground,\r\n        Whom Story’s tongue and Honour’s trump resound,\r\n      Quelling all loudest blasts of meaner fame.\r\n      How hosts and legioned chiefs he overcame,\r\n        Kings, but for him invincible, discrowned,\r\n        Swayed realms beyond Imagination’s bound,\r\n      And his own mightier soul did rule and tame--\r\n      This knows the admiring world, and this the Sun,\r\n        That did with envy and amazement see\r\n        His equal course with equal glory run\r\n      Wide earth around; which now accomplished, he,\r\n        From heaven observant of the world he won,\r\n        Smiling inquires, 'And toiled I thus for thee?'_\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI DELLA CASA (1500-56) emulated Caro in the nobility of his\r\nstyle, which would scarcely have been expected, considering the\r\nlicentious character of some of his verse and his ecclesiastical\r\nprofession. He does, however, sometimes attain a dignity and gravity\r\nwhich, apart from the beauty of his diction, lift him high out of the\r\ncrowd of Petrarchists; nor are his themes invariably amorous. His\r\n_Galateo_, a treatise on politeness, has earned him the name of the\r\nItalian Chesterfield. He would have attained greater eminence as a man\r\nof letters but for the distractions of politics and business, which he\r\ndeplores in the following sonnet:\r\n\r\n      _To woodland fount or solitary cave\r\n        In sunlit hour I plained my amorous teen;\r\n        Or wove by light of Luna’s lamp serene\r\n      My song, while yet to song and love I clave;\r\n      Nor by thy side the sacred steep to brave\r\n        Refused, where rarely now is climber seen;\r\n        But cares and tasks ungrateful intervene,\r\n      And like the weed I drift upon the wave.\r\n      And idly thus my barren hours are spent\r\n        In realms of fountain and of laurel void,\r\n        Where but vain tinsel is accounted blest.\r\n      Forgive, then, if not wholly unalloyed\r\n        My pleasure to behold thee eminent\r\n        On pinnacle no other foot hath prest._\r\n\r\nANGELO DI COSTANZO (1507-91), already noticed as an historian, is\r\nanother example of a writer of sonnets who rose from the crowd by the\r\nindividuality which he contrived to impress upon his performances. His\r\ngreat characteristic is an exquisite elegance, not, as in some other\r\ninstances, veiling inanity, but usually the accompaniment of something\r\nwell worth saying. The following piece is a good instance of his power\r\nof enhancing, by ingenious embellishment, a thought interesting and\r\nattractive in itself:\r\n\r\n      _River, that from thy Apennine recess,\r\n        Swollen with surge of tributary snow,\r\n        Com’st foaming, and thy tawny overflow\r\n      Hurlest on Samnian vales with headlong stress;\r\n      Thy farther shore, inhere Love awaits to bless,\r\n        I seek, and by thy wrath unharmed would go;\r\n        If thou intendest not my overthrow,\r\n      With stringent curb thy furious flood repress.\r\n      But art thou verily resolved to kill,\r\n        And purposest that this conclusive day\r\n        Shall jointly terminate my good and ill,\r\n      Grant me but once to stem thy shock and spray:\r\n        My happy errand I would fain fulfil;\r\n        Me going spare, returning sweep away._\r\n\r\nThe general passion for verse naturally extended to the refined and\r\naccomplished ladies of the time. Only two, however, have gained a\r\npermanent position in Italian literature, as much by their characters\r\nas by their poetry. The muse of VITTORIA COLONNA (1490-1547) chiefly\r\nprompted the apotheosis of her husband, the Marquis of Pescara, “a\r\nsworded man whose trade was blood,” and who, though a great captain,\r\nscarcely possessed a single amiable or magnanimous trait of character.\r\nThe pathos of the situation surpasses that of the verse which it called\r\nforth. As a woman, Vittoria evoked the enthusiastic admiration of her\r\ncontemporaries, and lives for posterity more in the strains of Michael\r\nAngelo than in her own.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy fate of GASPARA STAMPA (1524-53), who literally died\r\nof love, would have preserved her name without her verse; she was,\r\nnevertheless, a true poetess, and might have been a great one had she\r\nnot, like so many poetesses, struck upon the fatal rock of fluency.\r\nCould her centuries of sonnets be concentrated into a dozen, she would\r\nrank high.\r\n\r\nMore truly a poet than any of the stricter Petrarchists is a\r\nNeapolitan, LUIGI TRANSILLO, although his advantage is rather intensity\r\nof feeling than superiority in the poetic art. He must indeed be\r\nadmitted to have derogated in some measure from the high standard of\r\ntaste then generally prevalent, and to have foreshadowed, though but in\r\na very trifling degree, the extravagances of the seventeenth century.\r\nThis may be forgiven to his southern ardour and liveliness, and foreign\r\ncritics are not likely to perceive the little technical defects so\r\nseverely visited upon him by his countrymen. He had the unspeakable\r\nadvantage over his competitors of being devoted to no ideal nymph, but\r\nto a real and very great and very cold lady, the Marchioness del Vasto,\r\nwife of the Viceroy of Naples. Such an attachment was necessarily\r\nPlatonic on his part, and imaginary, if so much, on the lady’s. The\r\nfirst rapture is magnificently expressed in the sonnet in which the\r\npoor knight and military retainer, whose business in life was to help\r\nin clearing the Mediterranean of Turks, compares his rash love to the\r\nflight of Icarus:\r\n\r\n      _Now that my wings are spread to my desire,\r\n        The more vast height withdraws the dwindling land,\r\n        Wider to wind these pinions I expand,\r\n      And earth disdain, and higher mount and higher:\r\n      Nor of the fate of Icarus inquire,\r\n        Nor cautious droop, or sway to either hand;\r\n        Dead I shall fall, full well I understand;\r\n      But who lives gloriously as I expire?\r\n      Yet hear I my own heart that pleading cries,\r\n        Stay, madman, whither art thou bound? descend!\r\n        Ruin is ready Rashness to chastise.\r\n      But I, Fear not, though this indeed the end;\r\n        Cleave we the clouds, and praise our destinies,\r\n        If noble fall on noble flight attend._\r\n\r\nSuspicion, jealousy, bitterly wounded feeling, open breach, and hollow\r\nreconciliation make up the remainder of the sonnets, the best of which\r\nhave few superiors in any literature for fire and passion. His other\r\npoetical performances are far from inconsiderable. The best known is\r\nthe sin of his youth, the _Vendemmiatore_, whose ultra-Fescennine\r\ntruth to rustic manners and the licence of the vintage brought it into\r\nthe Index, and its author into gaol. In quite a different key are\r\nhis delightful didactic poems, _Il Podere_, on the management of an\r\nestate, and _La Balía_, on the care of children, translated by Roscoe.\r\nSome of his familiar _Capitoli_ are very pleasing, and some of his\r\nmiscellaneous poems are very fine, especially this on the Spaniards\r\nslain by the Turks at Castel Nuovo, on the coast of Dalmatia:\r\n\r\n      _Hail, scene of fated Valour’s final stand,\r\n        Revered far these sad heaps of whitening bone,\r\n        Their trace who other monument have none,\r\n      Pyreless and tombless on this desert strand;\r\n      Who hitherward from far Iberian land\r\n        To Adria’s shores on blast of battle blown,\r\n        With streaming blood of foemen, and their own,\r\n      Came to empurple foreign sea and sand.\r\n      Three hundred Fabii gave immortal name\r\n        To ancient Tiber; what to Spain by death\r\n        Heroic of three thousand shall be given?\r\n      Greater the host, more excellent the aim\r\n        Of warrior martyrs; those their dying breath\r\n        Resigned to Italy, and these to heaven._\r\n\r\nThe graceful poets who thus tuned their harps to the notes of Petrarch\r\nsang within the hearing of a spirit of another sort, whose verses, had\r\nthey known them, they would have compared unfavourably with their own\r\nelegance, but whose appearance in their circle would have been like\r\nthat of Victor Hugo’s Pan at the banquet of the Olympians. MICHAEL\r\nANGELO, the greatest Italian after Dante, had not, like Dante, acquired\r\nthe secret of poetic form. He indites as on marble with mallet and\r\nchisel; but the inscription is everlasting. “Ungrammatical, rude in\r\nversification, crabbed or obscure in thought,” as Symonds describes\r\nthem, Michael Angelo’s sonnets are yet priceless as a revelation of the\r\nman, more distinct than that vouchsafed by his painting or sculpture.\r\nThese tell of his tremendous force; the deep springs of tenderness in\r\nhis nature are only to be learned from the poems, the most important of\r\nwhich are consecrated to Love, now ideal and impersonal, now expending\r\nitself upon some fair object, masculine or feminine, but in either\r\ncase Platonic. Vittoria Colonna and Tommmaso de’ Cavalieri are the\r\nobjects of the poet’s deepest attachment. The following sonnet was most\r\nprobably inscribed to Cavalieri:\r\n\r\n      _By your eyes’ aid a gentle light I see,\r\n        Which but for these mine own would never share;\r\n        By your auxiliar feet a load I bear\r\n      Which my lame limbs refuse to bear for me.\r\n      I, plumeless, yet upon your pinions flee;\r\n        When heaven I seek, your soul conducts me there;\r\n        Blushes or pallor at your will I wear;\r\n      Sun chills and winter warms at your decree.\r\n      The fashion of your will prescribeth mine;\r\n        My thought hath in your thinking taken birth;\r\n        My speech gives voice to your discourse unspoken.\r\n      A sunless moon that by herself would shine,\r\n        I were without you; only seen on earth\r\n        By light of sun that on her dark hath broken._\r\n\r\nThe roughness of Michael Angelo’s verse was planed down by the first\r\neditor, his great-nephew, and the true text has only been retrieved in\r\nour time.\r\n\r\nTwo religious poets stand aloof from the class of Petrarchists, rather\r\nby the nature of their themes than the quality of their talent. CELIO\r\nMAGNO, a religious poet of Protestant tendencies, produced a hymn to\r\nthe Almighty which ranks among the best canzoni of the period, and\r\nhad anticipated Coleridge’s project, which with him as with Coleridge\r\nremained a project, for a series of similar compositions. GABRIELE\r\nFIAMMA, Bishop of Chioggia, is in general a tame versifier, but in\r\ntwo inspired moments produced two of the most beautiful sonnets in\r\nthe language: one of which is remarkable for expressing in an ornate\r\nstyle the thought of Heine’s famous lyric, “Mein Herz gleicht ganz dem\r\nMeere”; the other, apart from its great beauty, as an instance of a\r\nsonnet which, beginning apparently in a commonplace style, is vivified\r\nthrough and through by the last tercet:\r\n\r\n      _Never with such delight the bee in spring,\r\n        When the full mead teems with the novel flower,\r\n        The sweetness of the honey-burdened bower\r\n      Amasses for her cell in wayfaring;\r\n      Not with like joy, when glades cease echoing\r\n        The baying hound, no more compelled to cower\r\n        In covert, doth the hind the forest scour,\r\n      Panting for crystal rivulet or spring:\r\n      As I the sob acclaim that signifies\r\n        Passion of love or awe divinely given,\r\n        Or other ecstasy that God endears.\r\n      Transported with her bliss the spirit cries;\r\n        How vast his rapture who inhabits heaven,\r\n        If joy he hath more joyful than these tears!_\r\n\r\nThe Cinque Cento period of Italian poetry, which to the men of that\r\nday seemed the _ne plus ultra_ of artistic achievement, has since\r\nreceived less praise and exerted less influence than fairly its due.\r\nIt was a great thing to have produced works so perfect in form, and\r\nto have refined the language in so eminent a degree. The general\r\nbelief, too, that the Italian poetry of this age was devoid of all but\r\nformal excellence involves a great exaggeration. It is true that the\r\nliterature of the period is overloaded with masses of mechanical and\r\nconventional stuff, but Guidiccioni and Casa and Tansillo are capable\r\non occasion of expressing themselves with an energy the more impressive\r\nfrom being restrained within the limits prescribed by a chastened\r\ntaste, and many Italian sonnets are even better fitted to be breathed\r\nfrom the trumpet than warbled to the lute. A great development in this\r\ndirection might have been expected, but for the extinction of political\r\nand spiritual liberty.\r\n\r\nWhat the Italian lyric might have become we see in Milton, who could\r\nhave written neither his _Lycidas_ nor his sonnets without Tuscan\r\nmodels. He undoubtedly weighted, without overweighting, both canzone\r\nand sonnet with thought to a degree unparalleled in Italy, but how much\r\nhe owed to Italians appears by a comparison of his sonnets with those\r\nof Wordsworth, who neglected the traditions which Milton carefully\r\nobserved. Wordsworth has even more ripeness of thought and moral\r\nelevation than his predecessor; but while Milton’s work is immaculate,\r\nWordsworth’s is full of flaws.\r\n\r\nWith all its defects, the poetry of the Cinque Cento will survive as\r\na proof that rules of art exist and may be ascertained, and cannot be\r\nsafely departed from; no less than as an example of the embellishment\r\nwhich even ordinary thoughts may receive from nobility of diction\r\nand breadth of style; and as an instance of the great part which a\r\nliterature not too original or too racy of the native soil may play\r\nin moulding and enriching the literatures of neighbouring and less\r\nadvanced nations. Nor can it be fairly judged by itself as an isolated\r\nphenomenon. It was a part, and far from the most important part, of a\r\nstupendous artistic movement, which spoke more readily and eloquently\r\nwith brush and chisel than with pen, and expressed through their medium\r\nmuch that in an age more exclusively literary would have been committed\r\nto paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV\r\n                   HUMOROUS POETRY--THE MOCK-HEROIC\r\n\r\n\r\nNumerous as are the poets we have briefly passed in review, many\r\nmore might have been added whom it would have been agreeable to have\r\nmet in the barren fifteenth century. The Renaissance had by this\r\ntime entered into the blood of Italy, and produced one of the best\r\neffects of impregnation with the classical spirit--a passion for fame.\r\nThis we find as constantly assigned as a motive of action in public\r\naffairs in that day as humanitarian inducements are in ours; and when\r\nit is considered that the sincerity of the former motive is much\r\nless questionable than that of the latter, it is not clear that the\r\ncomparison is wholly to the advantage of the nineteenth century. Almost\r\nevery man of any mark was deeply influenced by it, and it was one of\r\nthe most potent instruments in stimulating both literary and artistic\r\nproduction. The drawback was that the aspirant to fame was naturally\r\ninclined to take the easiest and most fashionable path, and thus the\r\nsame impulse which braced effort suppressed originality.\r\n\r\nThe sentiment of an age mainly under the sway of Petrarch naturally\r\nencouraged the production of lyrical poetry, and other styles were\r\nneglected in comparison. Apart from the epical attempts which have\r\nbeen mentioned, and the dramatic and humorous poems to which allusion\r\nremains to be made, the period has little to show apart from the\r\nlyric, with the exception of some didactic poems--the _Balía_ and the\r\n_Podere_ of Luigi Tansillo, the _Nautica_ of Baldi, the _Caccia_ of\r\nValvasone, and two others modelled after Virgil, the _Coltivazione_\r\nof Luca Alamanni, and the _Api_ of Giovanni Rucellai, both excellent\r\nexamples of the description of poetry which owes most to artifice and\r\nleast to inspiration. This might perhaps pass for a general character\r\nof the poetry of the period, which ranks with the ages of Augustus and\r\nAnne as an example of what exquisite culture can and cannot effect\r\nin the absence of creative power. It was of high value to succeeding\r\nperiods by bequeathing to them a norm and standard of good taste by\r\nwhich to chasten their frequent aberrations; and, notwithstanding its\r\nalmost academical character, it was actually in vital relation with the\r\nliterary appetite of its limited but highly accomplished public. There\r\nwas not, says Dolce, a cultivated person in Italy who could not repeat\r\nbefore it was in print Bernardo Tasso’s sonnet resigning his mistress\r\nto his successful rival, a fact which proves not only the existence\r\nof a general appreciation of poetry independent of the machinery of\r\nreviewing and the printing-press itself, but also a general preference\r\nfor its most refined and dignified examples.\r\n\r\nThe didactic poems of which we have spoken claim the less attention,\r\ninasmuch as they were in no respect national. The rules for good\r\ndidactic poetry are the same in all languages, and any accomplished\r\nversifier will instruct in agriculture or the chase in much the\r\nsame manner in any country, however his local colouring may vary\r\nwith his climate. It is otherwise with satirical, familiar, and\r\nmock-heroic poetry. In all these styles Italian work is individual\r\nand characteristic. Satiric traits are frequent enough in the\r\ncontemporaries of Dante, and from one point of view Dante himself may\r\nbe regarded as a great satirist. The professed satire, nevertheless,\r\nof modern Italy derives from Horace rather than Juvenal; it aims at\r\ngood-humoured raillery rather than scathing vehemence or corroding\r\nvirulence; and its impetus is further moderated by its being generally\r\ncomposed in the easy and garrulous _terza rima_. Alessandro Vinciguerra\r\n(born 1480) appears to have first imparted this stamp; but the great\r\nexemplar is Ariosto, whose satires are not the least ornament of his\r\npoetic crown, yielding little in facetious urbanity to his model Horace.\r\n\r\nThe vigorous satires of Luigi Alamanni, imitated in English by Sir\r\nThomas Wyat, evince a remarkable freedom of speech. Bentivoglio,\r\nAretino, Anguillara, and other writers of note followed in his track\r\nwith varying success. The first to employ blank verse in satire was\r\nLodovico Paterno, who is perhaps more exceptionally distinguished for\r\nhaving achieved an epithalamium to Queen Mary of England without the\r\nleast allusion to her restoration of the Roman Catholic religion.\r\nThe _Decennali_ of Machiavelli, a highly-condensed sketch in verse\r\nof the events of his time, may also be regarded as a satire; but his\r\nreputation as a poet rather arises from his _Capitoli_, disquisitions\r\nin verse in which Tansillo and many others also excelled, and whose\r\neasy familiarity is hardly to be paralleled in any other literature,\r\nand from his elegant versification of portions of Apuleius’s _Golden\r\nAss_. FRANCESCO COPPETTA (1510-1554), an excellent writer of sonnets,\r\nextended the domain of poetry by constituting himself the first\r\nlaureate of the feline species. His ode on the loss of his cat (_di\r\ntutta la Soria gloria e splendore_, and consequently an Angora) is\r\na curious blending of parodies of Petrarch with genuine feeling. He\r\neventually finds comfort in the conclusion that the object of his\r\naffections has been appropriated by Jupiter and placed among the\r\nconstellations. Two brilliant stars never seen before have of late been\r\nobservable in the firmament, and the inference is obvious.\r\n\r\nAriosto and Machiavelli, nevertheless, although geniuses of the\r\nfirst order, rank in familiar poetry below FRANCESCO BERNI, better\r\nequipped for it by nature and entirely devoted to its practice. Berni,\r\nborn at Lamporecchio, near Florence, about 1497, was a dependant of\r\nthe Medici, successively attached to Cardinal Bibbiena and to Bishop\r\nGhiberti, Papal datary. His life was consequently for a long time spent\r\nat Rome, where he enjoyed the friendship of the most eminent men of\r\nletters of the period, executed the remodelled version of Boiardo’s\r\n_Orlando Innamorato_ by which his name is best known, and produced\r\nthe numerous _Capitoli_, which would stand high as examples of easy\r\nfamiliar verse, were it not for their frequent indecency. They gave\r\nthe pattern of the style (_Bernesque_) which has derived its name from\r\nhim, and in which he has had many successors, but no absolute rival.\r\nHumour, as Roscoe remarks, is very local. Berni loses much, not merely\r\nby translation, but on perusal by a foreigner. It is enough for his\r\nfame if he continues to be appreciated in his own country, and that\r\nnothing worse happens to him abroad than must equally happen to the\r\nauthor of a _Hudibras_ or a _Jobsiad_. How well some portions of his\r\nwork lend themselves to translation in congenial hands may appear\r\nfrom a specimen, rendered by Leigh Hunt, of the poem whose subject is\r\nthe author’s own prodigious laziness. His portrait of himself is very\r\nlifelike, and probably very accurate:\r\n\r\n      _The man, for all that, was a happy man;\r\n        Thought not too much; indulged no gloomy fit;\r\n      Folks wished him well. Prince, peasant, artisan,\r\n        Every one loved him; for the rogue had wit,\r\n      And knew how to amuse. His fancy ran\r\n        On thousands of odd things which he had writ:\r\n      Certain mad waggeries in the shape of poems,\r\n      With strange elaborations of their proems._\r\n\r\n      _Choleric he was withal, when fools reproved him;\r\n        Free of his tongue, as he was frank of heart;\r\n      Ambition, avarice, neither of these moved him;\r\n        True to his word; caressing without art;\r\n      A lover to excess of those that loved him;\r\n        Yet, if he met with hate, could play a part\r\n      Which showed the fiercest he had found his mate;\r\n      Still he was proner far to love than hate._\r\n\r\n      _In person he was big, yet tight and lean,\r\n        Had long thin legs, big nose, and a large face;\r\n      Eyebrows which there was little space between;\r\n        Deep-set, blue eyes; and beard in such good case\r\n      That the poor eyes would scarcely have been seen\r\n        Had it been suffered to forget its place;\r\n      But, not approving beards to that amount.\r\n      The owner brought it to a sharp account._\r\n\r\nBerni’s death did him more honour than his life. The suppressed\r\ndedication to the twentieth canto of his _Orlando_ seems to prove that\r\nhe had become serious in his later years, and fallen under Protestant\r\ninfluences; but this was unknown to Cardinal Cibo, who deemed him the\r\nright sort of man to commend a poisoned chalice to the lips of Cardinal\r\nSalviati; and his refusal, there is every reason to believe, cost\r\nhim his own life (1535). He died with strong symptoms of poison, was\r\nburied hastily without epitaph or monument, and, although his works\r\nwere collected, nothing was said of the author. This sudden silence\r\ncorroborates the suspicion of his Protestantism.\r\n\r\nBerni’s chief characteristics as a poet are graceful ease and perfect\r\nmastery of style and diction. He is fluent and entirely unembarrassed,\r\nnever at a loss for the right word, and handles the difficult _terza\r\nrima_ with the facility of prose. This command of language would have\r\nraised him high if he had possessed any of the elements of greatness;\r\nbut he is incapable of elevated sentiment, and has the good sense never\r\nto aspire to it. What is most admirable in him, his poetical gift\r\napart, is the evident sincerity and consistency of his Epicurean view\r\nof life, and his eupeptic sanity. As regards his strictly original\r\ncompositions, he occupies about the same position in Italian poetry\r\nas Goldsmith would have filled in English if he had written nothing\r\nbut _Retaliations_ and _Haunches of Venison_. In his _rifacimento_\r\nof Boiardo’s _Orlando Innamorato_ he has attempted something more\r\nconsiderable, and, from his own point of view, with much success.\r\nModern taste will hardly sympathise with his disfigurement of the\r\nromantic grace and simple sincerity of the original, for the mere sake\r\nof heightening the comic element and improving its style. In his own\r\nday men thought differently, and it must be admitted that the disparity\r\nbetween Boiardo’s comparatively unadorned groundwork and the brilliant\r\nsuperstructure of Ariosto marred the continuity of the _Orlando_ as a\r\nwhole, and that the chasm may well have seemed to require filling up.\r\nBerni could not impart the special qualities of Ariosto, but he could\r\nbring Boiardo’s style more nearly up to Ariosto’s level, and he could\r\nadorn his original by graceful introductions to the respective cantos.\r\nBoth these objects have been achieved with taste and success; and\r\nalthough Boiardo’s comparatively artless composition is still the best,\r\nas nearest to Nature, it cannot be denied that Berni’s alterations must\r\nhave appeared to his contemporaries great improvements, and that his\r\nembellishments may be read with abundant pleasure. Conscious of his\r\nlack of poetical invention, he has abstained from interfering with the\r\nnarrative. His work was not published until after his death, and there\r\nis reason to suspect that it was considerably adulterated by or at the\r\ninstance of the great literary bully of the day, Pietro Aretino.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that Berni had any intention of parodying the\r\n_Orlando Innamorato_ in his _rifacimento_; he simply wished to bring\r\nit, in his conception, nearer to the literary level of the continuation\r\nwhich had superseded it, and deemed that this could be best effected by\r\nan infusion of humour and satire. It would be a still greater error to\r\nassume, with some modern Italian critics, an intention on the part of\r\nBoiardo and Ariosto of parodying the old chivalric romance. They merely\r\ndesired to adapt it to the spirit of their own age, as Tennyson has\r\nadapted the _Morte d’Arthur_ to ours, and their sprightliness is the\r\ncorrelative of his moral earnestness. Ariosto is less reverent of his\r\noriginal than Boiardo, but he keeps within bounds. The great success\r\nof his poem, however, was sure to evolve a _bona-fide_ parodist, as\r\nin our day Mark Twain has capered with cap and bells in the wake of\r\nTennyson. The Italian Mark Twain was TEOFILO FOLENGO (1491-1544), known\r\nunder his pseudonym of _Merlinus Cocaius_ as a distinguished cultivator\r\nof macaronic poetry, a by-path of literature which we are compelled\r\nto leave unexplored. He was a dissipated runaway monk, who repented,\r\nbecame serious, and resought his cell just as he seemed within an ace\r\nof turning Protestant. His _Orlandino_ is a burlesque upon the poems\r\nof chivalry, with pieces of genuine poetry interspersed, and many\r\ndigressions on the corruptions of the age, especially the vices of the\r\nreligious orders. It is unfinished. What was published is said to have\r\nbeen written in three months, a statement confirmed by the energy of\r\nthe verse.\r\n\r\nIt was a great step in Greek comedy when the mythological parodies\r\nwhich had constituted the substance of the middle comedy were replaced\r\nby the picture of contemporary manners which formed the staple of\r\nthe new. So great an advance could not be made by ALESSANDRO TASSONI\r\n(1565-1638), the chief representative of serio-comic poetry in the\r\nseventeenth century, for his age would not have tolerated it; but he\r\neffected much in the same direction by converting the mere parody of\r\nthe chivalric romance which had satisfied his predecessors into the\r\nmock-heroic epic, a form of literature which, if he did not invent, he\r\nmay claim to have perfected. Instead of contriving burlesque variations\r\nupon Ariosto, he took a real incident of a serio-comic nature--the war\r\nwhich in the thirteenth century had actually broken out between the\r\nrepublics of Modena and Bologna respecting a bucket carried off by the\r\nformer. The treatment is admirable; the characters, some of whom are\r\nhistorical, and others sketched after Tassoni’s contemporaries, have\r\nan air of reality altogether wanting to the personages of Folengo’s\r\nparodies; there is enough of idyllic charm and tender pathos here\r\nand there to approve the writer a true poet, while humour dominates,\r\nand many of the sarcasms are really profound. A more biting irony on\r\nthe wretched dissensions which had been the ruin of Italy cannot be\r\nconceived; and, notwithstanding a subordinate purpose of deriding\r\nTasso’s languid imitators, and the personal quarrel which prompted\r\ncomposition in the first instance, such was probably the main purpose\r\nof the writer, in his political sentiments and aspirations a statesman\r\nof the type of Machiavelli and Guicciardini, who burned with hatred of\r\nthe Spanish oppressor, but, except for the two Philippics he composed\r\nin demonstration of the real hollowness of the Spanish power, could\r\nfind no other vent for his patriotism than his poetry, and wasted his\r\nlife in the service of petty princes. _La Secchia Rapita_ (_The Rape of\r\nthe Bucket_) was published under a pseudonym at Paris in 1622, having\r\nlong circulated in manuscript. Tassoni also showed himself a bold if\r\nbilious critic of Petrarch, against whose predominance a reaction was\r\ndeclaring itself, and participated in the general anti-Aristotelian\r\nmovement of his times by a volume of miscellaneous reflections.\r\n\r\nA contemporary of Tassoni is usually named along with him as a master\r\nof the heroi-comic style, but is in every respect greatly his inferior.\r\nThis is FRANCESCO BRACCIOLINI (1566-1645), whose pen, if he really\r\nmeant to serve the Church by ridiculing the classical mythology, should\r\nhave been wielded a century sooner. Part of the humour of his _Scherno\r\ndegli Dei_ consists in the unconscious anachronism. It manifests\r\nconsiderable fertility of invention, and has survived the author’s four\r\nepics, placed as these were immediately after Tasso’s by good judges in\r\nhis own day. The _Malmantile Racquistato_ of Lorenzo Lippi the painter,\r\nthe delight of the philologist for its idiomatic Tuscan, is remarkable\r\nfor embalming much local folk-lore, and so many local phrases as to be\r\nshorter than its own glossary.\r\n\r\nTwo more recent examples of the mock-heroic epic maybe included here\r\nto complete the subject. The _Ricciardetto_ of NICOCOLÒ FORTEGUERRI,\r\npublished under the pseudonym of Carteromaco, has received much merited\r\nand more unmerited praise. The author (1670-1730) was a prelate of the\r\nRoman court, and so great a favourite of Pope Clement XII. that he is\r\nsaid to have died from mortification at having displeased his patron\r\nby neglecting to ask for a vacant appointment. His poem burlesques the\r\nchivalric epics of Ariosto and others, not with the refined raillery of\r\na Berni, but in a style of broad, coarse buffoonery. It was published\r\nafter his death, when his friends sought to extenuate its unclerical\r\ncharacter by alleging that it had been undertaken for a wager, composed\r\nin spare intervals of time, and never designed for publication. All\r\nthese statements seem to be groundless. It has considerable merit as a\r\nburlesque, and some passages indicate a talent for serious poetry which\r\nmight have developed into something considerable; in the main, however,\r\nthe ability displayed is of a low though drastic strain. The best idea\r\nis that of making the Saracen champion Feraù turn hermit, a character\r\nwhich he supports less in the fashion of St. Jerome than of Friar Tuck.\r\n\r\nIt seems an instance of apparent injustice in prevalent literary\r\nopinion that the _Ricciardetto_ should be so widely known, while no\r\nless a poem than Leopardi’s Supplement (_Paralipomeni_) to Homer’s\r\nBattle of the Frogs and the Mice is hardly mentioned. The wonder,\r\nhowever, is not so great as it seems. Forteguerri wrote what all\r\ncould understand, while Leopardi only cared to please exceptional\r\nreaders, and was, moreover, compelled to shroud much of his satire in\r\nobscurity for fear of the ruling powers. The allegory, nevertheless, is\r\nsufficiently transparent. The vanquished mice are the people of Italy;\r\nthe frogs are the priesthood and other accomplices of the powers of\r\ndarkness; the crabs, who turn the scale in the latter’s favour, are the\r\nAustrians. The weakness and disunion of the oppressed, no less than the\r\nbrutality of the oppressor, are depicted with the most refined sarcasm.\r\nNothing can be more humorous, for example, than the crab’s exposition\r\nto the mouse of the principle of the balance of power; and through\r\nall the fancy and drollery pierce the grief and rage of a patriotic\r\nItalian. There are also fine flashes of true poetry, especially\r\nnear the end, when the adventurous mouse visits the underworld of\r\nhis species; and Ariosto is parodied as well as Dante. The satire,\r\nnevertheless, transcends the appreciation of ordinary readers; and it\r\ncertainly does appear somewhat singular that the fastidious author, who\r\ncomposed so sparingly and with such difficulty upon the most exalted\r\nthemes, should have bestowed so much labour upon a _jeu d’esprit_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n                               THE NOVEL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe novel presents one of the most remarkable examples in literary\r\nhistory of arrested development, and of all departments of literature\r\nis perhaps the only one which failed to attain perfection in the hands\r\nof the ancients. Great progress is indeed observable from its first\r\nartless beginnings under the Pharaohs, so recently recovered for us;\r\nbut having advanced far along several lines, it becomes stationary\r\nupon all. The germ of the picaresque novel is clearly discernible in\r\nPetronius, of the novel of adventure in Apuleius, of erotic fiction\r\nin Longus; but these examples apparently remain ineffectual. Either\r\nthe path is not prosecuted at all, or it leads to mere repetition. No\r\nnew element appears until we encounter the chivalric romance, which in\r\nSpain produced an extensive prose literature, but in Italy ran almost\r\nentirely to verse. The more elaborate romances of Boccaccio, indeed,\r\ndisclose influences from this quarter; but their reputation was slight\r\nin comparison with those short and familiar tales, commonly founded\r\nupon some anecdote and dealing with scenes and personages of real\r\nlife, which prescribed the form for the national novelette. A more\r\ndistinctively national type never existed. The extraordinary thing is\r\nthat the nation never got beyond it. It should have seemed an obvious\r\nadvance to lengthen the stories; to stimulate surprise and suspense by\r\ngreater intricacy of plot; to embellish by elaborate description; to\r\ndepict character with fulness and exactness; to employ fiction for the\r\nventilation of ideas. Precedents for all these improvements, except\r\nthe last, might have been found in the classical romances, and it\r\nmight have been expected that fiction would have experienced the same\r\ndevelopment as other branches of literature. On the contrary, the last\r\nItalian novelette is as far from the novel of the nineteenth century\r\nas the first, and the most powerful literary agent of good or evil,\r\nnext to the equally modern newspaper, remained to be created in recent\r\ntimes. Whatever the defects of the Italian novel of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, it was nevertheless, unlike the drama, a thoroughly national\r\nform of composition, it was far in advance of anything of the kind\r\nexisting elsewhere, and it exerted great influence on the literature of\r\nother countries as the general storehouse of dramatic plots.\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt to the credit of Italian novelists as artists that they\r\ndid not overload their stories with didactic purpose; but this was an\r\nerror which, writing mainly to amuse, they lay under little temptation\r\nto commit. None of them were endowed with creative imagination; none\r\ntranscended the sphere of ordinary experience, or showed the least\r\ninclination to effect for prose fiction what Boiardo and Ariosto had\r\naccomplished for narrative poetry. Their _notti piacevoli_ were not\r\nArabian Nights. Their object of amusing could consequently only be\r\nachieved by keeping close to actual manners, and we may depend upon\r\nreceiving from them a tolerably accurate picture of Italian society in\r\nso far as it suited them to present it; although the portion that best\r\nlent itself to their objects was the most licentious and corrupt, and\r\nthe loose women and salacious priests who recur in their tales from\r\ngeneration to generation, though by no means creatures of imagination,\r\nare still far from typical of the entire society of Italy. Like the\r\nmasks of the Greek comedy, like the rakes and topers of the English\r\ncomedy of the Restoration and Revolution, they are in a certain degree\r\ntraditional and conventional. Modern fiction is encyclopædic: no class\r\nof the community is outside its scope. Italian fiction was eclectic,\r\nrestricted by a tacit convention to what was deemed its appropriate\r\nsphere. The history of pictorial and plastic art has been reproduced\r\nin modern fiction; the property of the connoisseur has become the\r\npossession of the nation. Hence, whatever the literary merits of the\r\nItalian novelists of this period, whatever the fidelity with which they\r\nreproduce the social atmosphere of the time, their works all taken\r\ntogether count for less in the history of the human mind than those of\r\na single first-class modern novelist such as Dickens or Balzac.\r\n\r\nBoccaccio’s immediate successors as novelists are FRANCO SACCHETTI\r\nand GIOVANNI FIORENTINO, already mentioned as poets of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. Sacchetti (1335-1410) had in his youth been a merchant, and\r\nhad travelled much both in Italy and in Slavonian countries. After his\r\nreturn he became a Florentine magistrate, and filled some important\r\npublic offices. He was a man of solid and humorous wisdom, who\r\ninstructed his times, partly by religious and moral discourses, which\r\nfrequently display great liberality of feeling, partly by his stories,\r\nwhich, apart from their literary merits, afford a valuable picture of\r\na society half-way on the road from barbarism to civilisation. The\r\nmajority are founded on real occurrences, generally humorous, though\r\nthe humour is not always as visible to us as to his contemporaries; but\r\nsometimes tragic. Some, as with Boccaccio, are derived from folk-lore\r\nin the _Gesta Romanorum_ or the _Fabliaux_. All are recounted with\r\nextreme simplicity and brevity. The art of working up a single incident\r\ninto a long story by subtle delineation of character, elaborate\r\ndescription, and ingenious plot and underplot, was then unknown.[16]\r\nSacchetti is the straightforward _raconteur_ and nothing more, but\r\nhe deserves as much praise for the ease of his narrative as for the\r\npurity of his style. He can hardly be considered as an imitator of\r\nBoccaccio, who is always the poet and man of letters, while Sacchetti\r\nrather produces the impression of an ordinary Florentine gentleman\r\ntelling stories after dinner with no special care for artistic effect,\r\nwhich nevertheless he attains by the plain good sense which bids\r\nhim go straight to his subject and subordinate minor details to the\r\nreally essential. His tales are single, not set in a framework like\r\nBoccaccio’s.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not the case with his contemporary Ser Giovanni Fiorentino,\r\nauthor of the _Pecorone_ (_Great Stupid_), who has exposed himself to\r\nridicule by the quaintness of his introductory machinery. A friar and\r\na nun are supposed to meet weekly in the parlour of a convent, and\r\nconsole themselves for the insuperable obstacles to their attachment by\r\ntelling stories, upon the merits of which they compliment each other\r\nextravagantly. The tales, however, are interesting, well told, and\r\ngreatly esteemed for the excellence of their style. Like Sacchetti’s,\r\nthey are mostly genuine anecdotes, or at least founded upon fact or\r\npopular tradition; some are taken with little alteration from Villani’s\r\nChronicles. Nothing is certainly known of the author, except that\r\nhe began to write his tales in 1378 at the Castle of Dovadola, in\r\ncompulsory or voluntary exile from his native city. He is believed to\r\nhave been a notary, and a partisan of the Guelf faction.\r\n\r\nGiovanni da Prato, author of _Il Paradin degli Alberti_ (about 1420)\r\nalso deserves mention here, on account of the short stories inserted\r\ninto his ethical dialogues; but the first novelist of much importance\r\nafter Giovanni Fiorentino is MASSUCCIO of Salerno, a Neapolitan, who\r\nseems to have been a man of rank, and to have been for some time\r\nin the service of the Duke of Milan. He wrote about 1470, and his\r\ntales were first printed in 1476. The celebrity which he continues\r\nto enjoy is, it may be feared, mainly owing to his character as the\r\nmost licentious of the Italian novelists in fact, although, if we\r\nmay trust his own assurance, the most virtuous in intention. His\r\ntales are divided into five parts, each of the first three of which\r\nhas what the writer considers to be a distinct moral purpose. In the\r\nfirst, in Dunlop’s words, “the scope of the stories is to show that\r\nGod will sooner or later inflict vengeance on dissolute monks.” The\r\nsecond “proves that the monks of those days invented many frauds.”\r\nThe third “is intended to show that the greatest and finest ladies of\r\nItaly indulged in gallantries of a nature which did them very little\r\nhonour.” All these propositions might have been thought susceptible\r\nof demonstration without the _Novellino_, and much better established\r\nthan Massuccio’s claim to a place among moralists or reformers. He\r\nprotests that his tales are “ower true,” and for the most part founded\r\non recent transactions; and, in fact, he appears less indebted than any\r\npredecessor to folk-lore and the French fabliaux. The last two sections\r\nof his work, however, contain love adventures of too exceptional a\r\nnature to be founded upon actual incidents. Some of these manifest,\r\nnot merely ingenuity of invention, but considerable tragic power. The\r\nstyle is somewhat barbarous; and the same remark applies to the lighter\r\nfiction, generally of the nature of anecdote, of his contemporary\r\nSabadino degli Arienti, a native and historian of Bologna. Sabadino’s\r\ntales are much less objectionable than Massuccio’s, though no less than\r\nhis in the author’s opinion _moralissimi documenti_. They are entitled\r\n_Porrettane_, from their having been composed for the amusement of the\r\nvisitors to the baths of Porretta, which gives them some importance\r\nas an index to the taste of the more opulent and leisured classes of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThe novels of the following century are exceedingly numerous, but in\r\ngeneral too much upon one pattern to deserve especial notice until we\r\narrive at those of Bandello, Cinthio, and Grazzini, each of whom is\r\neminent for some special characteristic. Of Firenzuola, one of the most\r\ntypical writers of his day, we have already spoken, his novelettes\r\nbeing generally interwoven with his other prose works. Two single\r\nnovelettes by separate authors deserve special notice as world-famous,\r\nthough not by the genius of their authors. The _Romeo and Giulietta_ of\r\nLuigi da Porto, a gentleman of Vicenza who died in 1529, is a powerful\r\nand well-told story, although it would have been little heard of but\r\nfor Shakespeare, who nevertheless seems to have been unacquainted with\r\nit, having founded his tragedy upon the inferior version made by Arthur\r\nBrooke after the French of Boistuau. The other story which has become\r\na portion of the world’s repertory of fiction is the _Belphegor_ of\r\nGiovanni Brevio, a subject also treated by Machiavelli, and revived\r\nin our own day by Thackeray. The idea of the devil’s aversion to\r\nmatrimony, not as a divine ordinance, but as a nuisance inconsistent\r\nwith his own peace and comfort, is so irresistibly comic that one is\r\nsurprised to find it originally Slavonian.\r\n\r\nThe celebrity of Pietro Aretino requires the mention of his novels,\r\nwhich, however, possess no very distinctive features. To find these\r\nwe must turn chiefly to Straparola, whose genre requires a distinct\r\nnotice; and, among those who diverged less from the beaten track,\r\nBandello, Cinthio, and Grazzini. Bandello, says Settembrini, depicts\r\nthe Italian, Grazzini the Florentine, Cinthio humanity at large.\r\n\r\nMATTEO BANDELLO (1480-1561) was a Lombard and a Dominican, who resided\r\nsuccessively at Mantua and at Milan, the latter city in his time one\r\nof the most uncomfortable places in Italy from the oppressions and\r\ndepredations of the Spanish soldiery. Popular commotions concurred\r\nto drive him to France, where Henry II. made him Bishop of Agen. His\r\nnovelettes had been composed before this distinction befell him, but\r\nhis episcopacy was no obstacle to their publication in 1554. Though\r\nfrequently licentious, his stories indicate a considerable advance upon\r\nhis forerunners in the power of depicting character and in seriousness\r\nof tone. He prefers historical narration to invention, and usually\r\nbases his tales upon some actual occurrence, often revolting for its\r\ncruelty or indecency. The story of _Violante_, analysed in No. 380\r\nof the _Edinburgh Review_, is a good example of his tragic force,\r\nand many others might be given. The pathetic grace of the opening\r\nof his _Gerardo and Elena_, analysed in the same essay, is no less\r\nexcellent in its more romantic and delicate way. He was a prolific\r\nwriter, producing no fewer than eighty-nine novelettes, more esteemed\r\nby foreigners than by his own countrymen, who were offended by his\r\nLombardisms. Settembrini, however, not in general favourable to the\r\nproductions of the Cinque Cento, pronounces him the first Italian\r\nnovelist after Boccaccio.\r\n\r\nNo imputation of rusticity can be attached to the diction of ANTONIO\r\nMARIA GRAZZINI, surnamed _Il Lasca_ (1503-83), for here the style\r\nis the main recommendation of the work. Grazzini, an apothecary\r\nby profession, was one of the chief promoters of the movement for\r\nprescribing a standard of pure Tuscan, and as one of the founders\r\nof the celebrated Academy _degli Umidi_, each of whose members was\r\nbound to assume the name of some fish, he called himself _Il Lasca_\r\n(the Roach), by which name he is best known. Such toys occupied the\r\nthoughts of Italians in an age of decay when great deeds had become\r\nimpossible. Grazzini’s stories are mostly taken from Florentine private\r\nlife, and as such have their value, apart from the idiomatic Tuscan,\r\nwhich is best apprehended by the writer’s countrymen. They are not of\r\nenthralling interest, and when tragical are sometimes revolting, but\r\nthe exposition is easy and artistic.\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI BATTISTA GIRALDI CINTHIO of Ferrara (1504-73) is better\r\nknown by name to English readers than most of his fellow-novelists,\r\nsince from him Shakespeare derived the plots of _Othello_ and _Measure\r\nfor Measure_. The story on which the former drama is founded is not\r\na bad specimen of Cinthio’s usual work. His subjects are frequently\r\ntragical, sometimes shocking, but the treatment is generally powerful,\r\nthe narrative direct and forcible, and he is in great measure exempt\r\nfrom the grossness of his contemporaries. The tales, a hundred in\r\nnumber, whence their title of _Ecatomithi_, are supposed to be narrated\r\non board a ship bound for Marseilles, and conveying a party of Romans\r\nescaping from the sack of the Eternal City. They are divided like\r\nBoccaccio’s into ten classes, each considered to illustrate some\r\nparticular point of morals or manners. They are highly respectable\r\nperformances; but by so much as they surpass Grazzini’s in matter they\r\nfall below them in style, which, though not incorrect, is devoid of\r\ncolour and individuality.\r\n\r\nSTRAPAROLA, already briefly alluded to, was a native of Caravaggio,\r\nand published his _Notti Piacevoli_ in 1554. He is a good story-teller,\r\nalthough a bad stylist; but what gives him an epoch-making rank among\r\nItalian novelists is not his merit or demerit in either capacity, but\r\nhis having been the first to avail himself of popular folk-lore as\r\na groundwork for fiction. Nothing is more annoying than the almost\r\ncomplete neglect of popular mythology by men of culture in antiquity.\r\nApuleius tells one inimitable tale, without saying where he got it.\r\nSynesius spends his evenings listening to the stories of the Libyan\r\npeasants, and is not at the trouble to preserve a single one. It\r\nis nevertheless clear that such tales must have been as rife in\r\nancient times as in our own. Straparola was perhaps the first man who\r\nsystematically turned them to literary account: it would have been\r\nwell if he had gone much further, and proportionately reduced his debt\r\nto Hieronymo Morlini, the chief recommendation of whose generally\r\nindecent and always ungrammatical Latin stories (Naples, 1520) is\r\ntheir exceeding rarity. Nearly a hundred years afterwards Straparola\r\nwas completely eclipsed both as concerned the quantity and the quality\r\nof his folk-lore fictions, by the _Pentamerone_ of GIOVANNI BASILE,\r\nCount of Morone, a collection whose relation to the popular mythology\r\nof other nations has occasioned endless discussion. Puss in Boots, and\r\nCinderella, and Rapunzel, and many another favourite owe to Basile\r\ntheir first appearance in literary costume. In narrative he is the\r\nbreathless, loquacious, exuberant Neapolitan, too much in a hurry to\r\ntrouble himself about style or art, but carrying all before him by\r\nhis vigour and vehemence, and betraying, as his German translator has\r\npointed out, strong traces of the influence of Rabelais.\r\n\r\nIt will be evident from the above brief sketch of the Italian novel\r\nthat in the sixteenth century the art of novel-writing was nearly\r\nidentical with the art of narrative. This was fully possessed by most\r\nwriters of fiction; but characterisation, ingenuity of construction\r\nand development of plot, underplot, episode, artful suspension of\r\ninterest, above all the application of the novelist’s art to weighty\r\npurposes, were all in the most rudimentary condition. Compared with\r\nthe modern novel, the ancient story is as a simple air upon a flute to\r\nthe complicated harmony of an organ. It is true that the old romances\r\nabound with hints and germs only needing development, but development\r\nwas slow in coming, and even when about the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury romance and novelette had grown into the novel, it was still\r\nlong before the novel became a vehicle of ideas and a potent factor in\r\ncivilisation. The reason probably is that while the novel may employ\r\nthe highest human faculties, it is at the same time the best medium for\r\nconveying ideas to the less cultivated orders of society. The extension\r\nof reading and writing to these classes has called forth a tribe of\r\nreaders which had no existence in the days of the Cinque Cento, and has\r\ninvested the only description of literature which powerfully appeals\r\nto them with extraordinary significance. The influence of the novel\r\nin the modern sense grows, and will continue to grow; but there is\r\nstill abundant room for the short and simple story, the consistent\r\ndevelopment of a single incident or situation, compensating in art for\r\nwhat it lacks in variety, yet, now that human life has become so much\r\nricher and more complex than of old, at a further remove from mere\r\nanecdote than seemed necessary for its Italian prototype.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] The Italian style of novel has been imitated in English in\r\n_Stories after Nature_, by Charles Wells, author of _Joseph and his\r\nBrethren_, with great success, except for Wells’s deficiency in humour,\r\nand his employment of a more poetical diction than the Italians would\r\nhave allowed themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII\r\n                               THE DRAMA\r\n\r\n\r\nAlone among the great nations of the modern world, Italy stands in the\r\nunenviable position of possessing no drama at the same time national\r\nand literary. From one point of view three classes of the drama may be\r\ndistinguished, (1) The rude popular play entirely a creation of the\r\npeople, such as the buffooneries of the Dionysiac festival, out of\r\nwhich the Athenian drama grew, or the dramatic exhibitions at fairs of\r\nitinerant actors barely distinguishable from mountebanks, like those\r\nwhose puppet-plays originated _Faust_. Performances of this nature have\r\nprobably existed in every nation endowed with the rudiments of culture.\r\n(2) These crude beginnings elevated by men of genius into the sphere\r\nof art, and become literary without ceasing to be popular. This is the\r\ntrue national drama, when the pulses of the poet and the people beat\r\nin full unison, and of which Greece, England, and Spain have given the\r\nworld the most brilliant examples. (3) The artificial drama, written by\r\nmen of culture for men of culture, but neglecting, or at least failing\r\nto reach the heart of the people. With the exception of the musical\r\ndrama of which Metastasio affords the type, and of the comedies of\r\nGoldoni and Gozzi, all of which belonged to a more recent period than\r\nthat with which we are now engaged, the whole of the Italian drama\r\npossessing any literary pretensions belongs to this class. It is true\r\nthat, as in England and elsewhere, it is accompanied by a lower order\r\nof dramatic composition which may be regarded as popular. In the early\r\ndays of the Italian drama we have the _Rappresentazioni_, at a later\r\nperiod the _Commedia dell’ Arte_, of both of which some notice must be\r\ntaken. But neither is, strictly speaking, literature.\r\n\r\nIt appears at first exceedingly surprising that a nation, not only\r\nso gifted as the Italian, but so dramatically gifted, should not\r\nmerely never have achieved a national drama, but should have no\r\ndramatic writer meriting to be ranked among the chief masters of\r\nthe art. Lively, emotional, capable of being worked up to the most\r\nviolent degrees of passion; at the same time observant, sagacious,\r\nreflective; members of a society comprising every variety of character\r\nand profession, and inheritors of a history replete with moving and\r\ntragic incidents, Italians should seem to have wanted no requisite\r\nfor the creation of a flourishing stage. Prolific they were indeed:\r\nmore than five thousand plays were written between 1500 and 1734.\r\nPerhaps there are not five which enjoy any considerable reputation out\r\nof Italy, or which, whatever their literary merit, can be considered\r\ncharacteristically Italian. The most potent of probable causes will be\r\nadduced in its place, but no single explanation, or any accumulation\r\nof partially satisfactory explanations, will entirely account for\r\nso remarkable a circumstance. One reason was probably the great\r\ndevelopment of Italian culture at an early period, compared with that\r\nof other European nations. The ablest men had become fully acquainted\r\nwith Seneca and Terence, and looked upon them as painters looked upon\r\nRaphael, or sculptors upon Phidias. They deemed them the norm of\r\nexcellence, and condemned themselves to a sterile imitation, which\r\nmight and often did possess high literary merit, but which was entirely\r\nestranged from popular sympathies. Men like Politian and Pontano, who\r\nreally could have created a national drama if they could have trusted\r\ntheir own instincts, were deterred from producing anything at variance\r\nwith the canons in which they themselves believed. It must be said\r\nin extenuation of their error, that the classical school, with all\r\nits defects, was vastly in advance of the rude, amorphous beginnings\r\nof the romantic drama in every country but one. One little corner of\r\nEurope alone possessed in the early sixteenth century a drama at once\r\nliving, indigenous, and admirable as literature. Nothing in literary\r\nhistory is more surprising than the gap between Gil Vicente and his\r\ncontemporaries, whether classical or romantic. Had he been born an\r\nItalian instead of a Portuguese, the history of the Italian stage might\r\npossibly have been different. It nevertheless remains to be explained\r\nwhy no such person arose among so gifted a people, and why throughout\r\ntheir entire history, with one or two marked exceptions in particular\r\ndepartments, Italians have never had a drama that they could justly\r\ncall their own.\r\n\r\nIn its first beginnings, notwithstanding, the Italian drama was as\r\nnational as any other. As with all other modern European dramas, its\r\norigin was religious. Christianity found the need of replacing the\r\nheathen shows and spectacles it had suppressed, and amused the people\r\nwith representations of Scriptural subjects, or of incidents in the\r\nlives of the saints. For centuries these were never written down,\r\nbut improvised or exhibited in dumb show. Gradually the miracle-play\r\ncame into being, a more advanced development, compelling learning by\r\nrote and much drilling of the performers, and therefore of necessity\r\ncommitted to writing. In Italy this assumed a more polished form\r\nthan elsewhere, the _Rappresentazione Sacra_, rude in construction,\r\nbut composed frequently in elegant, sometimes in excellent octave\r\nverse. This was a development of the fifteenth century, the earliest\r\nof which the date is known being the _Abraham and Isaac_ of Feo\r\nBelcari, 1449. It became exceedingly popular in the later part of\r\nthe century, especially at Florence. No less distinguished a person\r\nthan Lorenzo de’ Medici is enumerated among its authors. Numbers of\r\nsuch pieces were printed, down even to the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, and usually set off with wood-engravings, sometimes of great\r\nelegance. The materials were usually drawn from ecclesiastical legend.\r\nConstantine is represented as giving his daughter to his successful\r\ngeneral Gallicanus, on condition of his becoming a Christian. Julian,\r\nmarching to wage war with the Persians, is slain by an invisible saint.\r\nThe histories of Tobit, of St. Agnes, of St. Cecilia, and numbers\r\nof similar legends, form the staple subjects. Sometimes romance is\r\nlaid under contribution, as in the instance of the Emperor Octavian,\r\nbut always with a religious motive. Dramatic force does not seem to\r\nhave been much considered, the stately octave being better adapted\r\nfor declamation than for dialogue; but the stage directions are\r\nvery precise, and every effort seems to have been made to impress\r\nthe spectators, so far as permitted by the rudeness of the open-air\r\ntheatre, a mere scaffold with perhaps a curtain for a background, yet\r\noften very splendidly decorated.\r\n\r\nHow near Italy came to creating a national drama is shown by\r\nthe frequent representations of public events upon the stage,\r\nquite in the spirit of Shakespeare’s historical plays. Two types\r\nmay be discriminated--one adhering very closely to that of the\r\n_Rappresentazioni_, and composed in the vernacular; the latter\r\nfollowing classical models, and in Latin. To the latter belongs\r\nthe very tedious play of Carlo Verardi on the fall of Granada,\r\nperformed before Cardinal Riario in 1492; but the very remarkable and\r\nunfortunately lost dramatic chronicle of the usurpations and downfall\r\nof the house of Borgia, acted before the Duke of Urbino on the recovery\r\nof his states in 1504, seems rather to have belonged to the former\r\nclass. To this type also is allied the first Italian drama of genuine\r\nliterary merit, the _Orfeo_ of Politian, where the dialogue is mostly\r\nin octave stanzas, as in the _Rappresentazioni_, and the object is\r\nevidently rather to delight the spectators by a rapid succession of\r\nscenes admitting of musical accompaniment than to “purge the soul by\r\npity and terror.” Slight as this juvenile work of Politian’s is, it\r\nis the work of a poet, and written with a swing and rush which recall\r\nthe lyrical parts of the _Bacchæ_ of Euripides. It indicates what the\r\n_Rappresentazioni_ might have become but for the competition of the\r\nmore classical type of drama, and seems a prelude to the thoroughly\r\nnational species of composition which arose in the seventeenth and\r\nprevailed in the eighteenth century, the opera.\r\n\r\nThe Italian stage had thus made a respectable beginning with the drama\r\na hundred years before any drama worthy of the name existed in England.\r\nThe disappointment of such auspicious promise is justly ascribed by\r\nSymonds, in great measure, to the want of a representative public and a\r\ncentre of social life. The emulation of a number of independent cities,\r\nso favourable to the development of art, prevented the development\r\nof the national feeling essential to a national drama. The political\r\ncircumstances of these communities, moreover, were inimical to the\r\nexistence of a popular stage. Theatrical representations remained\r\nthe amusement of courts; and when the general public was allowed to\r\nparticipate in them, the play itself was so enveloped in show and\r\nspectacle as to appear the least part of the entertainment. It was not\r\npossible that under such circumstances the drama could deviate far\r\nfrom conventional models. Tragedy continued to be composed after the\r\npattern of Seneca, an imitation of an imitation. Comedy, though also in\r\nbondage to classical precedents, could not avoid depicting contemporary\r\nmanners, and hence displays far more vitality and vigour.\r\n\r\nLatin plays had been written by Italians from the beginning of the\r\nfifteenth century, and had included comedies, now lost, by persons of\r\nno less account than Petrarch and Æneas Sylvius. The first vernacular\r\ntragedies worthy of the name were composed for the entertainment of\r\nthe court of Ferrara, and were written in the octave stanza or _terza\r\nrima_. No genius could have adapted this form to the exigencies of the\r\nstage, and a great step was taken when in 1515 Trissino, whose epic\r\non the Gothic wars has been previously noticed, wrote his tragedy of\r\n_Sophonisba_ in blank verse, retaining nothing of the lyrical element\r\nbut the chorus. The piece marks an era, and as such remains celebrated,\r\nnotwithstanding its total want of poetry and passion. It would have\r\nbeen a good outline for an abler hand to have clothed with substance.\r\nTrissino had abundance of successors and imitators, most of whom had\r\nmore poetical endowment, but few more genuine vocation, and all of whom\r\nare devoid of any impulse except the ambition of literary distinction.\r\nThis could only be reached by the prescribed path; and no vestige of\r\noriginality appears in any of them except Sperone Speroni’s innovation,\r\nnot laudable in a tragedy, although a fruitful suggestion for the\r\npastoral drama, of mingling lyrical metres with the regulation blank\r\nverse. The subject of his play, the incest of Macareus and Canace,\r\ninfinitely overtaxed his elegant talent. Of the other tragedies of the\r\ntime, the best known are the _Rosmunda_ of Rucellai, the _Mariamne_\r\nof Lodovico Dolce, and the _Orbecche_ of Cinthio the novelist,\r\nwhose _Epitia_ contains the rude germ of Shakespeare’s _Measure for\r\nMeasure_[17]. At a later date tragedy was attempted by a true poet of\r\ngreat genius, who would assuredly have produced something memorable\r\nunder favourable circumstances. Hut the composition of Tasso’s\r\n_Torrismondo_, commenced in his youth, was long interrupted, and the\r\nplay was completed in 1586 under the depressing circumstances of his\r\nMantuan exile. It thus wants energy; and, as Carducci remarks, Tasso is\r\ntoo much of an eclectic, striving by a combination of the advantages\r\nof all styles to supply the one indispensable gift of poetical\r\ninspiration, which misfortune had all but extinguished.\r\n\r\nThe first Italian comedies, like the tragedies, were written in rhyme.\r\nOne early example is entitled to notice, both on account of the\r\nsubject and as the work of an excellent poet, the _Timone_ of Boiardo.\r\nIt is little more than a translation of Lucian’s Dialogue, yet was,\r\nwe feel confident, the channel through which Shakespeare gained the\r\nacquaintance with that work revealed in his _Timon of Athens_. The\r\nhistory of Italian comedy as a recognised form of art should, however,\r\nbe dated from the _Calandra_ of Cardinal Bibbiena, first performed\r\nabout 1508. It hardly attempts delineation of character, but, as\r\nSymonds remarks, “achieved immediate success by reproducing both the\r\nhumour of Boccaccio and the invention of Plautus in the wittiest\r\nvernacular.” The plot is taken from the _Menæchmi_ of Plautus, the\r\nsource of Shakespeare’s _Comedy of Errors_; but Bibbiena’s idea of\r\nmaking the indistinguishable twins brother and sister enhances the\r\ncomic effect at the expense of morality, little considered by cardinals\r\nin those days.\r\n\r\nThe great success of Bibbiena’s comedy was calculated to encourage\r\nrivalry, and it chanced that two of the first men in Italy of the day\r\npossessed the dramatic instinct, combined with a decided gift for\r\nsatire. In the year following the exhibition of the _Calandra_ (1509),\r\nAriosto gave the _Cassaria_, a comedy of intrigue on the Plautine\r\nmodel. The same description is applicable to his other comedies, the\r\n_Suppositi_, the _Lena_, the _Negromante_, and the _Scolastica_. In\r\nall except the _Negromante_ the action turns upon the stratagems of a\r\nknavish servant to obtain for his master the money indispensable for\r\nthe gratification of his amorous desires. This style of comedy requires\r\na well-contrived plot, and the maintenance of the interest throughout\r\nby a series of ingenious surprises and unforeseen incidents. In these\r\nAriosto fully attains his object. Writing for the amusement of a\r\ncourt, he does not care to stray from the conventions which he knows\r\nwill satisfy, and his pieces afford no measure of the success he might\r\nhave attained if he had appealed to the public and essayed to depict\r\nItalian society as it existed. One of the characters is exceedingly\r\nlifelike, the accommodating Dominican in the _Scolastica_, who, armed\r\nwith all imaginable faculties from the Pope, is ready to commute the\r\nfulfilment of an inconvenient vow into the performance of some good\r\nwork profitable to his order. This play was left unfinished, but was\r\nwritten before the _Lena_ and the _Negromante_, which probably appeared\r\nabout 1528.\r\n\r\nThe other Italian comic writer of genius was one of more powerful\r\nintellect and more serious character than Ariosto, if less richly\r\nendowed as a poet. Released from prison after the overthrow of his\r\nparty and the loss of his political position in 1512, Machiavelli\r\nfound solace in the composition of the _Mandragola_ (_Mandrake_),\r\na piece acted before the Pope in that day, and which could hardly\r\nbe represented anywhere in this. Its cynicism is worse than its\r\nimmorality, the plot consisting in the stratagem by which an innocent\r\nyoung wife is persuaded to admit a lover; all the personages, including\r\nthe husband, who is nevertheless himself deceived in a material point,\r\nco-operating for so laudable an end. Disagreeable as the situation is,\r\nit is probably founded upon fact; and at all events the play is no\r\npale copy of Plautus or Terence, but full of consistent and strongly\r\nindividualised characters, and scenes of the most drastically comic\r\neffect. The portrait of the rascally father confessor is particularly\r\nvigorous, and proves of itself how ripe the times were for Luther. A\r\ndozen more plays of equal merit would have raised the Italian stage\r\nvery high. But no successor to Machiavelli appeared; and his other\r\nplay, the _Clizia_, is deficient in originality, being little more than\r\na paraphrase of the _Casina_ of Plautus.\r\n\r\nMany comedies of considerable merit succeeded Machiavelli’s, among\r\nwhich may be particularly mentioned those of Firenzuola, who followed\r\nRoman precedents, and of Cecchi, and Gelli, and Grazzini, who to a\r\nconsiderable extent disengaged themselves from tradition. Angelo\r\nBeolco, called _Il Ruzzante_, struck upon a new vein in the delineation\r\nof rustic life, involving the employment of dialect; and, near the end\r\nof the century, the life of the people was represented with extreme\r\nvividness by Buonarotti, nephew of Michael Angelo, in his _Fiera_ and\r\n_Tancia_. One other comic dramatist takes an important place, the\r\nrepulsive and decried Aretino. His claim to permanent significance is\r\ngrounded, not on the scanty literary merits of his works, but on the\r\nunique characteristic thus expressed by Symonds, “They depict the great\r\nworld from the standpoint of the servants’ hall.” They are the work of\r\na low-minded man, who could see nothing but the baser traits of the\r\nsociety around him, but saw these clearly, and also saw no reason why\r\nhe should not blazon what he saw. Hence his usefulness is in the ratio\r\nof his offensiveness.\r\n\r\nIt is significant of the difference between the Italian mind and the\r\nSpanish, and of the extent to which the former had emancipated itself\r\nfrom mediævalism, that the _Rappresentazione_, touching so nearly on\r\nthe confines of the Spanish _Auto_, never developed into that or any\r\nallied variety of the drama. The abstractions of the vices and virtues,\r\nso natural to the Spaniard and the man of the Middle Age in general,\r\nwere uncongenial to the Italian, whose _Rappresentazioni_ were always\r\npeopled by definite, tangible persons, even if of the spiritual order.\r\nThe _Adamo_ of Andreini, early in the seventeenth century, from which\r\nMilton undoubtedly derived his first idea of treating the Fall in a\r\nmiracle play, might have led to a development in this direction, but\r\nremained an isolated eccentricity. The true national development lay\r\nin quite another path, the pastoral drama. Something like this might\r\nbe found in Gil Vicente, but we may be certain that his works were\r\ntotally unknown in Italy, and that the pastoral play grew out of such\r\nromances as the Arcadia, such eclogues as those of Baptista Mantuanus,\r\nand the court masques in which the principal parts were taken by\r\nshepherds and shepherdesses. Politian’s _Orfeo_ is not very far from\r\nbeing such a piece, although it is a good deal more. A pastoral masque\r\nwas composed as early as 1506 by Castiglione for the amusement of the\r\ncourt of Urbino. Others followed from time to time, and developed into\r\na real pastoral drama by Beccari in 1554; but the literary pretensions\r\nof this class of composition continued to be very slender until it was\r\nvirtually created by Tasso’s _Aminta_ in 1573. Few novel experiments\r\nin literature have enjoyed a more immediate or more permanent success.\r\nNumerous as were the _Aminta’s_ imitators, its primacy has never but\r\nonce been seriously challenged, and its nature and simplicity have\r\nin general been justly preferred to the more elaborate artifice of\r\nthe _Pastor Fido_. It is indeed deficient in the rich poetry of its\r\nEnglish rival, the _Faithful Shepherdess_, “as inferior, poetically\r\nspeaking,” says Leigh Hunt, “as a lawn with a few trees on it is to\r\nthe depths of a forest.” But Leigh Hunt confesses its superiority in\r\n“true dramatic skill, and flesh and blood interest”: it is indeed as\r\nfar as anything can be from the insipidity usually associated with\r\npastoral compositions. It has, moreover, more of the genuine yearning\r\nfor the golden age, the spirit which inspires Keats’s _Endymion_, than\r\nis found in the fanciful dramas of Fletcher, or Milton, or Ben Jonson.\r\n“The central motive of _Aminta_ and the _Pastor Fido_,” says Symonds,\r\n“is the contrast between the actual world of ambition, treachery, and\r\nsordid strife, and the ideal world of pleasure, loyalty, and tranquil\r\nease.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the pastoral drama is a legitimate as well as a beautiful kind\r\nof composition, it is not capable of very great extension or variety.\r\nTasso’s successors might conceivably surpass him as poets, but could\r\nonly repeat him as dramatists. His only serious competitor is his\r\ncontemporary GIOVANNI BATTISTA GUARINI, the author of the _Pastor Fido_\r\n(1537-1612).\r\n\r\nGuarini, the descendant of a Veronese family already distinguished\r\nin letters, was, like Tasso, attached to the court of the Duke of\r\nFerrara; but, unlike Tasso, was a man of the world, and was employed\r\nin several important missions, especially one to solicit the crown\r\nof Poland for his master, where he nearly died of a Polish inn. Like\r\nmost of the Duke’s literary protégés, he became estranged from him,\r\nand spent the later part of his life in roaming from court to court in\r\nquest of employment, and litigating with his children and the world\r\nat large. His disposition was quarrelsome; literary disputes had long\r\nsevered him from Tasso; it is to his honour that when the latter was\r\nunable to watch over his own works, he took care of and published his\r\nlyrical poems. The most brilliant episode of Guarini’s life was the\r\npublication of his _Pastor Fido_ in 1590; but not the least troublesome\r\nwas the literary controversy in which it involved him. These disputes,\r\nborn rather of the idleness than of the conscientiousness of the\r\nItalian literati, are now forgotten, and the _Pastor Fido_, a direct\r\nchallenge to the _Aminta_, is allowed an honourable though a second\r\nplace. Its relation to its predecessor may be compared to that of the\r\nCorinthian order to the Ionic. Guarini has sought to compensate for\r\nthe lack of natural, spontaneous inspiration by superior artifice of\r\nplot: his characters are more numerous, and his action more intricate\r\nand ingenious. This would not have availed him much if he had not been\r\na poet, but this he certainly was, though with less of the _nascitur_\r\nand more of the _fit_ than usual. Tasso was conscious of a truer\r\ninspiration, and conveys his claim to the virtual invention of a new\r\nmode in poetry in the verses which he has placed in the mouth of Love\r\nappearing in the disguise of a shepherd, thus rendered by Leigh Hunt:\r\n\r\n      _After new fashion shall these woods to-day\r\n      Hear love discoursed; and it shall well be seen\r\n      That my divinity is present here\r\n      In its own person, not its ministers.\r\n      I will inbreathe high fancies in rude hearts;\r\n      I will refine, and render dulcet sweet,\r\n      Their tongues; because, wherever I may be,\r\n      Whether with rustic or heroic men,\r\n      There am I Love; and inequality,\r\n      As it may please me, I do equalise;\r\n      And ’tis my crowning glory and great miracle\r\n      To make the rustic pipe as eloquent\r\n      Even as the subtlest harp._\r\n\r\nGuarini frequently repeated Tasso’s ideas, striving to enhance their\r\neffect by careful elaboration. The poetry of one or both has passed\r\ninto Calderon’s _Magico Prodigioso_, and originated the scene of\r\nthe temptation of Justina, an ornament of English literature in the\r\nincomparable version of Shelley.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[17] The novel by Cinthio himself on which this play is founded was\r\ndramatised by Whetstone; but that Shakespeare had seen Cinthio’s\r\ndramatic version also may be inferred from a minute circumstance.\r\nCinthio’s play, not his novel or Whetstone’s adaptation of it, has\r\na character named Angela, whose name disappears from _Measure for\r\nMeasure_, but who bequeaths Angelo as that of her brother, whom Cinthio\r\ncalls Juristi, and Whetstone Andrugio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n                                 TASSO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1564 is memorable in the intellectual history of the world.\r\nIt marks the beginning of the long ascent of the North, and of the\r\nslow depression of the South. In it Shakespeare was born; in it\r\nMichael Angelo died; in it the decrees of the Council of Trent were\r\npromulgated by one of the most liberal and enlightened of the Popes,\r\neven as the Society of Jesus had been established twenty-four years\r\nbefore by another entitled to the same commendation. Neither Paul nor\r\nPius was free to gratify his personal inclinations at the expense\r\nof the institution over which he presided; and in fact the Society\r\nand the Council were less important in themselves than as indicative\r\nof the new spirit which was to prevail in Roman Catholic countries,\r\ndestructive, so far as its influence extended, of science, and deadly\r\nto learning, literature, and art. The time was at hand when the policy\r\nof great states was to be controlled by confessors; when the clergy,\r\nunder the influence of a training in special seminaries, were to\r\nbe converted from an order into a caste; when the entire influence\r\nof State and Church was to be devoted to the repression of free\r\nthought, with the inevitable result of intellectual degeneracy, and\r\nmortifying inferiority to the nations which, with whatever limitations,\r\nacknowledged the principle of freedom.\r\n\r\nFrom this period Italian literature, though still interesting in\r\nitself, becomes comparatively unimportant in its relation to general\r\ncivilisation; it drops from the first place into the third, and every\r\nyear widens the interval between the retrogressive and the progressive\r\npeoples. The results of eighty years of oppression are thus stated by\r\nan illustrious visitor on the authority of the Italians themselves:\r\n“I have sate among their learned men,” says Milton, “and been counted\r\nhappy to be born in such a place of philosophic freedom as they\r\nsupposed England was, while they themselves did nothing but bemoan the\r\nservile condition into which learning among them was brought, that\r\nthis was it which had damped the glory of Italian wits; that nothing\r\nhad been written there now these many years but flattery and fustian.”\r\nThese, it will be observed, are not Milton’s own words, but report\r\nthe views of the cultivated Italians with whom he associated, and\r\nwho, enslaved but not subdued, still nurtured hopes which our times\r\nhave seen fulfilled. Could the foreigner have been excluded, could\r\nmen like these have been left to settle by themselves with priest and\r\nprince, it is probable that the anti-Renaissance reaction and the\r\ncounter-Reformation would never have come to pass. Yet Italy cannot be\r\nwholly excused; the foreigner had brought the mischief, but who had\r\nbrought the foreigner?\r\n\r\nThis age of decadence is nevertheless represented to posterity by one\r\nof the greatest poets of Italy; nor can his misfortunes be specially\r\ncharged upon it. The sad story of TORQUATO TASSO has ever excited and\r\never must excite the deepest compassion; but it is not now believed\r\nthat any fellow-mortal was responsible for his sorrows, or that they\r\nwere materially aggravated by ill-usage from any quarter. The simple\r\nfact is that during the later part of his life Tasso was frequently\r\neither insane or on the borderland between sanity and insanity, and\r\nthat, given his peculiar mental constitution, his double portion of\r\nthe morbid irritability and sensitiveness commonly incidental to the\r\npoetical temperament, the same affliction must have befallen him under\r\nany circumstances or in any age of the world. It is indeed possible\r\nthat his brain was in some measure clouded and warped by the unnatural\r\ndiscipline of the Jesuits into whose hands he fell in his boyhood,\r\nand that this determined the nature of some of the symptoms of mental\r\nalienation which he afterwards manifested. It was, moreover, his great\r\nmisfortune that his age should have afforded no other sphere for a\r\ndelicate and candid mind than a court honeycombed with intrigue and\r\njealousy. Yet the fate of so morbidly sensitive a spirit could hardly\r\nhave been materially different; it is only wonderful that he should\r\nhave regained so much of his intellect and died master of himself.\r\nCourtly society and religious excitement between them admirably trained\r\nhis magnificent genius to write the _Jerusalem Delivered_, in its\r\nrelation to general culture the epic of the Roman Catholic revival,\r\nbut, from the large-hearted humanity of the author, happily much more.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of Tasso’s youth were such as to intensify the\r\ninnate melancholy of his disposition. His father Bernardo, whom we have\r\nmet with as a poet and a high-minded cavalier, ruined himself and his\r\nfamily within a few years after Torquato’s birth at Sorrento (1544)\r\nby the noble imprudence of the advice which he gave to his Neapolitan\r\npatron, and, though afterwards the servant of princes, died in poverty.\r\nWhen twelve years old Tasso lost his mother, poisoned, as was thought,\r\nby her relatives, to rob her husband of her portion. We have spoken of\r\nthe Jesuitry which marred his early education; afterwards, however,\r\nhe was brought up in a much saner manner. At Urbino, where his father\r\nfound a temporary refuge, afterwards in busy Venice and at Padua, where\r\nhe ineffectually studied law, he had become a master of classics,\r\nmathematics, and philosophy, and had not only read but annotated Dante.\r\nBy the time (1565) when he became attached to the court of Ferrara,\r\nhe had published his _Rinaldo_, in form an imitation of Ariosto, but\r\nindicative of a new spirit; and had less fortunately signalised the\r\ntermination of a two years’ residence at Bologna by a scrape in which\r\nhe had involved himself by reciting a pasquinade upon the university,\r\nwhich not unnaturally caused him to be accused of having written\r\nit. This adventure at least evinced serious deficiency in tact--an\r\nendowment more essential than genius in the situation where he now\r\nfound himself.\r\n\r\nTasso’s immediate obligations at the court of Ferrara were to Luigi,\r\nCardinal d’Este, brother of the Duke, who seems to have expected\r\nnothing from him but duteous attendance, and the completion of the\r\ngreat poem of which the _Rinaldo_ had given promise, and whose theme\r\nwas still unfixed. Nothing appears to the Cardinal’s disadvantage; nor\r\nis any especial reproach addressed to his high-spirited brother the\r\nDuke, except the heavy taxation he imposed to maintain a magnificence\r\ndisproportioned to his revenue. The two great ladies of the court,\r\nthe Duke’s sisters, were decidedly sympathetic, and there seems no\r\nreason to attribute malevolence to his fellow-courtiers. The situation\r\nof this child of genius at a court was indeed a false one, and could\r\nhave no fortunate issue; yet the innate germ of insanity would almost\r\ncertainly have developed itself, whatever the external circumstances of\r\nhis lot. For five or six years all went well. Tasso chose the subject\r\nof his poem, laboured diligently at it, attracted universal admiration\r\nby the brilliancy and fluency of his occasional compositions, disputed\r\nsuccessfully with the élite of Ferrara on the subject of Love, and in\r\n1571 accompanied the Cardinal on a mission to France. The French court\r\nhad not yet resolved upon the St. Bartholomew, and its coquettings with\r\nthe Huguenots scandalised the devout poet. He composed two discourses\r\nupon France and its affairs, which, although in some respects fanciful,\r\ndisplay much penetration. On his return he quitted the Cardinal’s\r\nservice for no very apparent reason, and shortly afterwards entered\r\nthe Duke’s. This would bring him into more intimate relations with the\r\nDuke’s sisters. One of these, Lucrezia, soon contracted, avowedly for\r\nreasons of state, a marriage with the Duke of Urbino; but Leonora, weak\r\nin health and devoted to good works, remained single. With her the\r\nromance of Tasso’s life is associated; and although the belief that\r\na presumptuous attachment occasioned his imprisonment is undoubtedly\r\ngroundless, the attachment itself is the evident inspiration of much of\r\nhis lyrical poetry:\r\n\r\n      _Lady, though cruel destiny deny\r\n        To follow you, and eager feet enchains,\r\n        Ever the heart upon your vestige strains,\r\n      And save your tresses knows not any tie.\r\n      And as the birdling doth attendant fly,\r\n        Lured by the hand that tempting food detains,\r\n        Moved by like cause if follows you and plains,\r\n      Pining for consolation from your eye.\r\n      Gently within your hand the roamer take\r\n        Into your breast, and let it nestle there,\r\n        Soothed to great blissfulness in narrow span,\r\n      Until at length its soul in song awake,\r\n        And its dear woe and your great worth declare\r\n        From Adria’s shore to shores Etrurian._\r\n\r\nSuch verses are too deeply felt for mere compliment, and, if sincere,\r\ncould only be addressed to some one much above himself in station. In\r\nanother sonnet a consciousness of presumption is clearly indicated:\r\n\r\n      _Of Icarus and Phaethon hast read?\r\n        Thou’lt know how one was in these waters whirled,\r\n        When he with orient light would wake the world,\r\n      And with sun’s fire endiadem his head;\r\n      That other in the sea, when, rashly spread,\r\n        His waxen wings he voyaging unfurled;\r\n        So headlong evermore the man be hurled\r\n      Who ways divine with mortal foot would tread.\r\n      But who shall quake in difficult emprise\r\n        If Gods attend him? What is not allowed\r\n        To Love, who knits in one all things divine?\r\n      Forsaking heavenly spheres that sing and shine,\r\n        By him Diana to a shepherd bowed,\r\n        And Ida’s youth was rapt unto the skies._\r\n\r\nNeither Tasso nor Leonora, however, was of an amorous temperament; and\r\nthere is no reason to suppose that he experienced any great difficulty\r\nin keeping his passion within Platonic bounds. The hidden flame may\r\nwell have wrought him to the production of his unsurpassed _Aminta_ in\r\n1572-73. But in 1574 a severe illness marks an era in his life; he is\r\nnever again quite the same man. In 1575 we encounter the first decided\r\nsymptoms of an unsettled mind in querulousness and morbid suspicion,\r\naugmented, we may well believe, by the vexations attendant upon the\r\nrevision of his now completed epic. He thought, and with justice,\r\nthat he had written a truly religious poem, and he now found the\r\necclesiastical reaction demanding by the mouth of Silvio Antoniano, a\r\ntype of the Roman Catholic Puritan of that ungenial day, that it should\r\nbe adapted to the reading of monks and nuns. Solerti, his chief modern\r\nbiographer, seems inclined to consider “his two years’ warfare with\r\nbigotry and pedantry” the principal cause of his insanity; Carducci\r\nrather accuses his Jesuit education. Both were actual causes, more\r\npotent and malignant than his sentimental attachment to Leonora; but in\r\ntruth the germ of insanity had always been latent in his brain, and the\r\nspecial occasion of its manifestation was comparatively immaterial.\r\n\r\nHappily, as Settembrini justly distinguishes, it was not obscuration\r\nor decay, but exalted tension of the mind, and left the power of\r\nthinking and writing almost unimpaired, except under the influence\r\nof violent paroxysm. The disorder assumed the special form of\r\nmorbid suspicion, a constant dread of inimical machinations, and\r\nself-accusation of imaginary heresies. He fled from Ferrara only to\r\nreturn; and at length (July 1579) a frenzied attack upon a retainer\r\nof the court necessitated his confinement as a lunatic. He would not\r\nhave been subjected to the indignity of chains in our day, but the\r\npsychiatry of that age knew no better, and the best proof that its\r\nmethods were not utterly perverse is the speedy restoration of his\r\nreason in a much greater measure than could have been hoped. At first\r\nhe was unquestionably maniacal; but his state gradually became one of\r\napparent sanity infested by delusions, to which many of the painful\r\nparticulars alleged in his letters are to be ascribed. One prevailing\r\nhallucination was the frequent visitation of a familiar spirit, with\r\nwhom he held long dialogues. His treatment improved with his mental\r\ncondition; though sometimes, by the inattention of his custodians, as\r\nwe must think, short of necessary food, he had comfortable apartments,\r\nwas allowed to carry on an extensive and apparently uncontrolled\r\ncorrespondence, and produced enough excellent work, chiefly prose\r\ndialogues, to prove at least the enjoyment of numerous lucid intervals.\r\nAt length, in July 1586, he was permitted to retire to Mantua. Alphonso\r\nappears to have behaved becomingly to the poet, considered merely as an\r\nunhappy vassal: it is no special reproach to him to have been neither\r\nan Alexander the Great nor a Wolfe to rightly appraise the comparative\r\nworth of the _Jerusalem Delivered_ and the ducal crown of Ferrara.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of Tasso’s life was spent in restless wanderings to\r\nand fro between courts and cities, like the tossings of a sick man\r\nwho vainly seeks ease by shifting his position upon his couch. He\r\ncould not live without a patron, and no patron long contented him. It\r\nwould be tedious to tell how often he forsook and resought Mantua,\r\nFlorence, Rome, Naples; he even made overtures of reconciliation to\r\nFerrara. It was not his fault, but sheer mental infirmity, by which,\r\nhowever, his reason, though frequently obscured or misled, was never\r\nagain overthrown. At Naples his friend Manso heard a profound argument\r\nbetween him and his familiar spirit; both voices were his own, but of\r\nthis Tasso was unconscious. He had completed and published his tragedy,\r\n_Torrismondo_, at Mantua in 1586; at Naples the exhortations of Manso’s\r\nmother led him to compose his blank-verse poem on the Week of Creation\r\n(_Il Mondo Creato_), chiefly remarkable for its evident influence on\r\nthe style and versification of Milton. The latter books, written in\r\nsickness, evince some languor, but no symptoms of disordered faculties\r\nappear, although the servility of the pseudo-religious sentiment\r\npainfully evinces how much ecclesiastical influences had enslaved him,\r\nand how he had fallen away from the free spirit of the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nAnother work of Tasso’s decline, the reconstruction of the _Jerusalem\r\nDelivered_ under the title of the _Conquest of Jerusalem_, although\r\nan error of judgment, yet rather indicates undue sensitiveness to\r\ncriticism than insanity. Imperfect as the first editions had been, the\r\n_Jerusalem_ had been received with enthusiasm, but had also excited\r\nmuch pedantic and some bigoted censure. The general result had been\r\nto convince Tasso that his poem was too romantic and not sufficiently\r\nepical; which, abstractedly considered, was true, but simply arose from\r\nthe fact that his genius was rather romantic than epic. In endeavouring\r\nto bring his poem nearer Homer he led it away from Nature, and the\r\nbeauties which he introduced bore no proportion to those which he\r\nretrenched. The new recension fell entirely flat, and is now almost\r\nunknown; although had the _Jerusalem Delivered_ never been published,\r\nthe _Conquest_ would undoubtedly have gained Tasso a considerable\r\nname. It was dedicated to a new patron, Cardinal Cinthio Aldobrandini,\r\nnephew of Pope Clement VIII., and all allusions to the house of Este,\r\nfor whose heritage the Pope, “hushed in grim repose,” was patiently\r\nwaiting, were carefully expunged. Cinthio proved a kind and considerate\r\npatron; and Clement, who was endowed with a regal instinct for doing\r\nthe right thing at the right time, was on the point of honouring Tasso\r\nwith a public coronation after the example of Petrarch, when on April\r\n25, 1595, death removed him from earthly honours and indignities in the\r\nconvent of San Onofrio, where he had for some time found an asylum, and\r\nwhere the crown which should have arrayed his temples was placed upon\r\nhis bier.\r\n\r\nApart from the failings without which he would hardly have been a\r\npoet, and the infirmities for which it would be unjust to make him\r\nresponsible, Tasso’s deportment throughout life was that of an amiable,\r\nhigh-minded, and accomplished gentleman. Two defects alone produce a\r\npainful impression--the entire lack of any sense of humour, and the\r\napparent indifference to all public interests outside of court and\r\necclesiastical life. The former of these was congenital, irremediable,\r\nand bitterly expiated by the undignified predicaments in which it\r\ninvolved him; the latter would not have existed if he had lived in\r\na better age. He did, indeed, like Spenser and Tennyson, attribute\r\na didactic and allegorical purpose to his poem which may have been\r\npatent to his own mind, but with which no reader, if not a commentator\r\nalso, ever concerned himself. Yet the significance of the _Jerusalem\r\nDelivered_ does not solely consist in the beauty of the language and\r\nthe exquisiteness of the characters: although an artificial, it is in\r\nsome sense a national epic. Thanks mainly to the pressure of foreign\r\ntyrants, Protestantism and the Renaissance both had for the time been\r\ncrushed in Italy, and the Italian poet who would be national must write\r\nin the spirit of the reaction. Catholicism was putting forth its utmost\r\nstrength to drive back the Ottoman and the heretic; and although, when\r\nTasso began his _Jerusalem_, he could have foreseen neither Lepanto nor\r\nthe St. Bartholomew, it is a remarkable instance of the harmony which\r\npervades all human affairs, that both should have happened ere he had\r\ncompleted it. Had either been the subject of his poem, the result would\r\nhave been utter failure; but the great theme of the Crusades exhibits\r\nthe dominant thought of his own day exalted to a commanding elevation,\r\nset at an awful distance, and purged of all contemporary littleness;\r\ntransfigured in the radiance of poetry and history. A nobler subject\r\nfor epic song could not well be found, save for the defect which it\r\nshares with almost all epics which have been created by study and\r\nreflection, and have not, like the _Iliad_, grown spontaneously out\r\nof the heart and mind of a great people. The principal action is\r\ninsufficient for the poem, and needs to be eked out and adorned by\r\ncopious episodes. The _Æneid_ would present a poor figure without the\r\nburning of Troy, the death of Dido, and Æneas’s descent to the shades;\r\nthe _Jerusalem_ is still more indebted to Clorinda and Armida, and\r\nthe embellishment is still more loosely connected with the poem’s\r\nostensible purpose. Tasso’s genius was in many respects truly epical;\r\nyet, the nearer he approaches lyric or pastoral, the more thoroughly he\r\nseems at home. That his Saracens should be more interesting than his\r\nChristians, and his Christians most interesting when least Christian,\r\nwas perhaps inevitable. It is a proof of the essential excellence of\r\nhuman nature that, unless in very extreme cases, its sympathies are\r\nalways most readily enlisted by the weaker side. Homer himself could\r\nnot avoid making Hector more attractive than Achilles. Another defect\r\nlay less in the nature of things than in the spirit of the age, the\r\noccasional anticipation of the false taste of the seventeenth century.\r\nItaly was weary of the elegant exteriors and empty interiors of the\r\ncompositions of Bembo and Molza. A Wordsworth, arising to proclaim\r\na return to nature, might have endowed her with a new age of great\r\nliterature, but the circumstances of the time absolutely forbade any\r\nsuch apparition, and the craving for vitality and vigour had to be\r\nappeased by a show of intellectual dexterity and mere exaggeration.\r\nTasso betrays just enough of the premonitory symptoms of this literary\r\nplague to call down the wrath of Boileau, whose outrageous denunciation\r\nhas been remembered where measured reproof would have been forgotten.\r\n\r\nWhen all has been said that can be said, the _Jerusalem Delivered_\r\nremains a very great poem, the greatest of all the artificial epics\r\nafter the _Æneid_ and _Paradise Lost_ (for Ariosto’s poem, so\r\nfrequently paralleled with it, is not an epic at all). That Tasso\r\nshould approach Virgil more nearly than any other poet is perhaps\r\nunfortunate for him; the _Jerusalem_ and the _Æneid_ constantly admit\r\nof comparison, and wherever comparison is possible the former is a\r\nlittle behind. To compare Tasso with Milton seems almost profanation;\r\nand indeed, if, as so often assumed, the greatness of an epic poet is\r\nto be measured by his sublimity, the _Jerusalem_ is entirely out of\r\nthe field. Milton is the sublimest of non-dramatic poets after Homer:\r\nTasso, always dignified and sometimes grand, rarely attains sublimity,\r\nand falls particularly short of it in the description of the infernal\r\ncouncil, where comparison with Milton is most obvious. Yet he has\r\nadvantages which it would be unjust to deny. He has not, like Milton,\r\nproposed to himself an unattainable object: he has not to justify\r\nthe ways of God to man, but to recount the conquest of Jerusalem.\r\nHe is more uniform in merit: it cannot be said of his poem that the\r\ncatastrophe takes place in the middle, and that the interest steadily\r\ndeclines thenceforth.\r\n\r\nWhat, however, especially distinguishes Tasso, not only from Milton,\r\nbut from modern epic poets in general, is the number and excellence of\r\nhis characters, mostly of his own creation. Rinaldo, Tancred, Argante,\r\nEmireno, Solimano, Clorinda, Armida, Erminia, form a gallery of\r\nportraits whose picturesqueness and variety redeem Tasso’s inferiority\r\nin other respects; while at the same time, even were his canvas less\r\nbrilliantly occupied, it could not be said that his poem wanted either\r\nthe unity, the interest, the dignity, the just proportion, the poetical\r\nspirit, the elevated diction, or the harmonious versification essential\r\nto a great epic. The great defect of the poem, regarded as an epic, is\r\nthat Tasso’s bent, like Virgil’s, was rather towards the pathetic, the\r\npicturesque, and the romantic, than towards the sublime and majestic.\r\nHe can command dignity and grandeur on occasion; but, even as the\r\n_Æneid_ opens most readily at Dido, Marcellus, or Euryalus, so the\r\n_Jerusalem_ attracts most by its female characters, Erminia, Clorinda,\r\nand Armida. Armida is a charming personage, an improvement upon the\r\nAlcina of Ariosto, but a passage like the following, rendered by Miss\r\nEllen Clerke, would be more appropriately placed in an _Orlando_ or\r\nan _Odyssey_ than in an epic on so high and grave a theme as the\r\nredemption of the holy city from the unbeliever:\r\n\r\n        _Arrived on shore, he in review doth pass\r\n      The spot with eager glance, but nought descries,\r\n      Save caves and water-flowers, and trees and grass,\r\n      So deems himself befooled; but in such wise\r\n      The place doth tempt--such charms did nature mass\r\n      Together there--that on the sward he lies,\r\n      His forehead from its heavy armour eases,\r\n      And bares it to the sweet and soothing breezes._\r\n\r\n        _Then of a gurgling murmur he was 'ware\r\n      Within the stream, and thither turned his eyes,\r\n      And saw a ripple in 'mid current there\r\n      Whirl round about itself in eddying guise,\r\n      And thence emerge a glint of golden hair,\r\n      And thence a maiden’s lovely face uprise;\r\n      Her voice the ear enthralled, her face the vision,\r\n      And heaven hung tranced upon her notes Elysian._\r\n\r\n        _And now the false one’s song of treacherous wile\r\n      O’erpowers the youth with slumberous heaviness,\r\n      And by degrees that serpent base and vile\r\n      Subdues his senses with o’ermastering stress,\r\n      Nor death’s still mimicry, wrought by her guile,\r\n      Could thunders rouse from; other sounds far less.\r\n      Then the foul sorceress from her ambush showing,\r\n      Stands over him, with hate and fury glowing._\r\n\r\n        _But as she gazing scans the gentle sighs,\r\n      The stir of whose soft breathing she can mark,\r\n      The smile that lurked around the beauteous eyes,\r\n      Now closed (what then their living glances dark?),\r\n      She pauses thrilled, then droops in tender guise,\r\n      Beside him--quenched her hatred’s every spark,\r\n      As rapt above that radiant brow inclining,\r\n      She seems Narcissus o’er the fountain pining._\r\n\r\n        _The dew of heat there starting, she ne’er tires\r\n      With tender fingers in her veil to dry;\r\n      While his cheek softly fanning, she desires\r\n      The heat to temper of the summer sky;\r\n      Thus (who could have believed it?) smouldering fires\r\n      Of hidden orbs dissolved the frost, whereby\r\n      That adamantine heart its core did cover,\r\n      And the harsh foe becomes the tender lover._\r\n\r\n        _Pale privet, roses red, and lilies white,\r\n      Perennial blooming on that lovely shore,\r\n      Blent with strange art, she wove in fetters light\r\n      Yet close of clasp, and flung them softly o’er\r\n      His neck and arms and feet; thus helpless quite\r\n      She bound and held him fast, and sleeping bore\r\n      Unto the prison of her car aerial,\r\n      And carried in swift flight through realms ethereal._\r\n\r\nFew of the great artificial epics of the world, those which have\r\nnot been moulded out of songs and legends welling up spontaneously\r\nfrom the heart of the people, can sustain very strict criticism of\r\ntheir poetical economy, and the _Jerusalem Delivered_ perhaps less\r\nthan any other. The subject of the Crusades, indeed, is a very great\r\none, too vast even to be embraced in a single poem; and the capture\r\nof Jerusalem, though of all its incidents incomparably the most fit\r\nfor poetical treatment, is not of itself sufficiently extensive for\r\nan epic poem. It must consequently be enriched by episodes, which in\r\nTasso’s hands have the double fault of jarring with the spirit of the\r\nmain action, and of obscuring its due predominance by their superior\r\nattractiveness. It might perhaps have been otherwise if Tasso had been\r\ncast in the mould of Milton or had lived in an austerer age. Italian\r\npoetry, however, was so saturated by the influence of Petrarch and\r\nAriosto that any embellishments of the chief action must of necessity\r\npartake of the character of love and romance. The former class, however\r\ncharming in themselves, inevitably depressed the character of an epic\r\nso largely depending upon them as the _Jerusalem_, below that proper to\r\nan heroic poem. The romance and sorcery, though recommended to Tasso\r\nas introducing the supernatural, then considered indispensable to epic\r\npoetry, provoke criticism by their inconsistency. If the enchanters\r\nIsmeno and Armida could do so much, they might have done a great deal\r\nmore. Ismeno has all the infernal hosts at his command, and makes\r\nhardly any use of them. Pluto is a most lazy and incompetent devil.\r\nArmida might easily have made her magic island impregnable. The whole\r\ncontrivance of the enchanted wood, though full of descriptive beauties,\r\nis weak as poetical machinery; it could have offered no real obstacle\r\nto the Christians. And it is almost comical to observe that amid all\r\nthe confusion the venerable Peter the Hermit knows perfectly well what\r\nis to happen, can remedy every misfortune when he chooses, and could\r\nhave prevented it but for the convenience of the poet, more inexorable\r\nthan the fiat of the Fates.\r\n\r\nThe merit of the _Jerusalem_, then, consists mainly in details whose\r\nbeauty requires no exposition. Mention has already been made of the\r\nmerit of the character-painting, which greatly surpasses Ariosto’s. The\r\nlatter’s personages are in comparison puppets; Tasso’s are living men\r\nand women. The passion of love in the three principal female characters\r\nis exquisitely painted, and admirably discriminated in accordance with\r\nthe disposition of each. Erminia, in particular, calls up the sweetest\r\nimage conceivable of womanly tenderness and devotion. Rinaldo is less\r\ninteresting than he should have been; but Tancred is the mirror of\r\nchivalry; and the difficulty of delineating a perfect hero without\r\nprovoking scepticism or disgust is overcome as nearly as possible in\r\nthe character of Goffredo. The veteran Raimondo’s insistence upon the\r\npost of honour and danger; the indomitable spirit of Solimano; the\r\ncircumspect valour of Emireno, devoid of illusion, and with no aim but\r\nthe fulfilment of duty--are noble traits, and the more so as the poet\r\nfound them in himself. The very last incident in the poem, Goffredo’s\r\ninterference to save his gallant enemy Altamoro, is one that could\r\nhave occurred to no one less noble and courteous than the author of\r\nthe _Jerusalem_. It is very different from Bradamante’s behaviour to\r\nAtlante in the _Orlando Furioso_.\r\n\r\nAnother honourable characteristic is Tasso’s love of science and\r\ndiscovery, revealed by many passages in his minor poems and his\r\ndialogues, and in the _Jerusalem_ by the noble prophecy of the Columbus\r\nto be. His sonnet to Stigliani, hereafter to be quoted, appears to\r\nhint that with better health and fortune he would himself have taken\r\nthe exploits of Columbus as the subject of another epic; and he is\r\nsaid to have remarked that the only contemporary poet against whom\r\nhe felt any hesitation in measuring himself was Camoens, the singer\r\nof the discoveries of the Portuguese. This theme, often essayed, and\r\nnever with success, would have favoured Tasso’s genius in so far as it\r\nexempted him from describing single combats and pitched battles. His\r\nbattle-pieces are not ineffective, but he is evidently more at home\r\namong the sorceries of Armida’s enchanted garden:\r\n\r\n      _“Ah mark!” he sang, “the rose but now revealed,\r\n      Fresh from its veiling sheath of virgin green,\r\n      Unfolded yet but half, half yet concealed,\r\n      More fair to see, the less it may be seen.\r\n      Now view its bare and flaunting pride unsealed;\r\n      All faded now, as though it ne’er had been\r\n      The beauteous growth, that while it bloomed retired,\r\n      A thousand maids, a thousand youths desired._\r\n\r\n      _“Thus passeth in the passing of a day\r\n      Life’s flower, with green and roseate tints imbued:\r\n      Think not, since Spring leads back the laughing May,\r\n      The mortal bloom shall likewise be renewed.\r\n      Cull we the rose in morning’s prime, ere grey\r\n      Dims the fair vault, and cloud and gloom intrude.\r\n      Cull we Love’s roses in the hour approved,\r\n      When whoso loves may hope to be beloved.”_\r\n\r\n      _He ceased, and with one voice the feathered choir,\r\n      Applauding as it seemed, resume their strain;\r\n      Again the billing, amorous doves suspire,\r\n      And every creature turns to love again;[18]\r\n      Chaste laurel burns, the thrilling sap mounts higher\r\n      In rugged oaks, light foliage flutters fain;\r\n      And earth and ocean seem to throb and move\r\n      With softest sense and sweetest sighs of Love._\r\n\r\nThe alterations introduced by Tasso when he remodelled his epic amount\r\nto an admission of the justice of the charges brought against him, of\r\nhaving deviated too much into picturesque episodes, and been, in short,\r\ntoo lyrical. It might therefore have been expected that he would have\r\ntaken a supreme place in lyrical poetry, and the anticipation would\r\nhave been confirmed by the triumph of his _Aminta_. It is not entirely\r\njustified by his other lyrical performances; few of his numerous\r\ncanzoni and multitudinous sonnets being absolutely in the front rank.\r\nThe cause is probably want of concentration; he was always ready with\r\na sonnet at call, and composed far too many upon petty and trivial\r\noccasions. His best lyrics, nevertheless, have a property which no\r\nother Italian poetry possesses in like measure--a certain majestic\r\nvehemence, like that of a mighty river, or what Shakespeare describes\r\nas “the proud full sail of his great verse.” It has even been argued,\r\nmainly on the strength of “that affable familiar ghost,” that Tasso\r\nwas the rival of whom Shakespeare complains; however this may be, no\r\ndescription could better express the peculiarity of his lyrical style.\r\nThe manner, unfortunately, is often far in advance of the matter. There\r\nis no more splendid example, for instance, than his “Coronal”[19] of\r\nsonnets, where a sonority and impetuosity that might have celebrated\r\nthe battle of Lepanto are squandered upon the house of Este. The same\r\nqualities, however, are always present when his feelings are deeply\r\nmoved, as when he accompanies in thought his lady to the verge of the\r\nsea:\r\n\r\n      _Silver and diamond and gem and gold--\r\n        Wealth from wrecks anciently by tempests rent--\r\n        And coral of its own with pearl besprent,\r\n      The sea in homage at thy feet uprolled;--\r\n      For whom might Jupiter again be bold\r\n        In shape of bull to plough the element--\r\n        And, foaming at thy feet in billows spent,\r\n      With liquid tongue its murmuring story told:\r\n      O Nymph, O Goddess, not from caverned bower\r\n        Of ocean sprung, but heaven, who canst enchain\r\n        My seething turbulence, not now the power\r\n      Of gentle moon conducts the obedient main,\r\n        But thine; fear nothing; I but swell to shower\r\n        My gifts, and turn me to my deeps again._\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] “_Ogni animal di amar si riconsiglia._” A line taken bodily out of\r\nPetrarch.\r\n\r\n[19] A series of twelve sonnets on the same subject, interlinked by\r\neach successive piece beginning with the last line of the preceding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n                 THE PROSE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth century is for Italy a period of stagnation, relieved\r\nonly by the endeavour to conceal decay by fantastic extravagance, by a\r\nfortunate reaction near its termination, and by some genuine progress\r\nin isolated directions, which would have been fruitful of important\r\nresults in a better age. The false taste which disfigured the epoch\r\nwas not peculiar to Italy; but while in other countries it appears a\r\nsymptom of exuberant life, a disorder incident to infancy, in Italy\r\nit dominates literature, some departments of practical knowledge and\r\nstudy excepted. What elsewhere was boisterous youth, was in Italy\r\npremature old age. No other cause for this decadence can be assigned\r\nthan the withering of national life under the blight of civil and\r\necclesiastical tyranny. The reform of the Church, the purification\r\nof morals, excellent things in themselves, had been bought from the\r\ncounter-Reformation at far too high a price.\r\n\r\nWe have indicated 1564 as the year in which the North of Europe begins\r\nto gain steadily at the expense of the South. The date especially fatal\r\nto Italy may perhaps be carried five years back, to 1559, when the long\r\ncontest between France and Spain for supremacy in the Peninsula was\r\ndecided in favour of the latter by the treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis. Up\r\nto this time the Italians had been in some measure able to play their\r\noppressors off against each other; and such from Alexander the Sixth’s\r\ntime had been the policy of the Popes, who all wished the expulsion\r\nof the barbarians, in so far as compatible with their own family\r\ninterests. The accommodation between the foreign Herod and the foreign\r\nPilate put an end to this system. The hope of the independence of Italy\r\nwas definitively resigned, the minor princes submitted to be Spanish\r\nvassals, and the Popes indemnified themselves by enlisting the monarchs\r\nin support of their spiritual authority. Jesuits, seminary priests,\r\nand inquisitors darkened the land, and the ever-augmenting pressure\r\nculminated at last in the rules for censorship promulgated by Clement\r\nVIII. in 1595, which effectually stifled freedom of thought, and\r\nstopped the dissemination of knowledge, except by leave of those whose\r\ninterest it was to prevent it. Not merely were heretical or licentious\r\nwritings interdicted, but criticism on rulers and ecclesiastics, and\r\npraises of the freedom and virtue of antiquity.\r\n\r\nSuch satires as those in which, in the days of the Renaissance,\r\nAlamanni and other orthodox Catholics had scourged the sins of\r\nChurch and State, could now be printed only in Protestant countries.\r\nAnything might be prohibited that shocked the prejudice or surpassed\r\nthe comprehension of an ignorant and bigoted priest. Authors were\r\ndiscouraged from writing, booksellers from publishing, and readers\r\nfrom reading, while the frivolous pedantry and execrable taste of\r\nthe Jesuits infected almost all the schools. Renaissance had become\r\nreaction; the new birth had passed into the second death. This iron\r\ndespotism could not be perpetually maintained. It was impossible to\r\nshut Italians out from all knowledge of the intellectual progress of\r\nProtestant countries, nor in the universal flux of things could the\r\nstern inquisitorial type of ecclesiastical ruler be stereotyped for\r\never. In course of time the _zelanti_ Popes gave way to affable and\r\nhumane personages, but the nation had meanwhile sunk into a mental\r\ntorpor, in which, with a few glorious exceptions, it remained plunged\r\nuntil the crash of the old order of things in the French Revolution.\r\nThe exclusion of the vivifying spirit of the Reformation, the\r\nimpossibility of so much as alluding, except in disparagement, to the\r\nchief transaction of contemporary history, indicate an emasculation, as\r\nwell as a paralysis, beyond the power of language to express.\r\n\r\nThe extinction of the free spirit of the Renaissance was the more\r\nunfortunate for Italy, as it arrested the development of speculative\r\nand scientific research which seemed opening upon her. It has been\r\nfrequently observed that the close of a brilliant literary epoch has\r\ncoincided with the birth of an era of positive science. The early\r\nGreek philosophers follow Homer and the rhapsodists; Aristotle and\r\nTheophrastus, Epicurus and Zeno, succeed the dramatists and the\r\norators; the decline of Latin literature is the age of the illustrious\r\njurists. Even so, as the great authors and the great artists departed\r\nfrom Italy, she produced her greatest man of science, and a bold school\r\nof philosophers arose to challenge the authority to which Dante and\r\nAquinas had bowed. “Philosophy,” says Symonds, “took a new point of\r\ndeparture among the Italians, and all the fundamental ideas which have\r\nsince formed the staple of modern European systems were anticipated by\r\na few obscure thinkers.”\r\n\r\nThe chief representative of physical science, however, was by no\r\nmeans obscure. GALILEO GALILEI was born in 1564, the year of the death\r\nof Michael Angelo. The scientific achievements of this mighty genius\r\ndo not concern us as such. It must not be forgotten, however, that\r\nhe was also an accomplished author in the vernacular. His immortal\r\nDialogue (1632), the glory and the shame of his age, is written in\r\nItalian, and is enumerated by Italians among exemplars of diction,\r\n_testi di lingua_. What he might have accomplished if he had enjoyed\r\nthe applause and sympathy which greeted a Newton is difficult to say;\r\nbut the contrast between the lot of the Master of the Mint and the\r\nPresident of the Royal Society on the one hand, and that of the lonely\r\ncaptive on the other, is not greater than that between the condition of\r\nEngland and that of Italy. It is needless to relate the oft-told story\r\nof Galileo, which indeed rather regards the history of science than\r\nthat of literature. We are only concerned with him as a typical figure,\r\nthe most eminent victim of the spirit of persecution which deprived\r\nItaly of her supremacy among intellectual nations, and which, even\r\nbefore Galileo had excited its hatred, had claimed another victim, less\r\nillustrious, but not less interesting.\r\n\r\nIt is probably owing to the considerable infusion of Greek blood into\r\nNaples and Sicily that the inhabitants of these regions, so backward in\r\nmany respects in comparison with the rest of Italy, have displayed a\r\npeculiar genius for philosophical research. Aquinas was a Neapolitan,\r\nand in our own day the subtleties of German metaphysics have found a\r\nmore sympathetic reception and a more ready comprehension in the South\r\nthan elsewhere in Italy. The four chief Italian thinkers of the late\r\nsixteenth and early seventeenth centuries belonged to the kingdom of\r\nNaples. BERNARDO TELESIO (1509-85) has missed the posthumous celebrity\r\nof the others by escaping their tragic fate; but his reputation in his\r\nown day was greater than theirs. Campanella wept at his tomb, and Bacon\r\ncalls him the first experimental observer of nature. He led the way in\r\nthe revolt against the authority of Aristotle which became general in\r\nthe seventeenth century, and his sensationalism helped to mould the\r\nthought of Hobbes and Gassendi.\r\n\r\nA fiery martyrdom, a sublimely poetical mind, and an intuition of\r\nmodern views and discoveries have made GIORDANO BRUNO a more celebrated\r\nand interesting figure than Telesio, although too far in advance of his\r\ncontemporaries and too late recognised by posterity to be influential\r\nwith either. “The most faithful and pithily condensed abstract of\r\nBruno’s philosophy,” says Symonds, “is contained in Goethe’s poem,\r\n_Prôömium zu Gott und Welt_. Yet this poem expresses Goethe’s thought,\r\nand it is doubtful whether Goethe had studied Bruno except in the\r\nwork of his disciple, Spinoza.” “Disciple,” it may be added, is much\r\ntoo strong a word to express the Hebrew thinker’s relation to the\r\nNeapolitan. It would be difficult to conceive two men more dissimilar,\r\nexcept in intellectual intrepidity and in love of truth. Spinoza is the\r\nclosest of reasoners, without a particle of poetry in his composition.\r\nBruno has magnificent divinations, with little reasoning power. If\r\nSpinoza did read him, he must have been greatly annoyed by him. On the\r\nother hand, the celebrated definition, “A God-intoxicated man,” which\r\nseems so inappropriate to the intellectual geometer of Amsterdam,\r\nabsolutely fits the rapt Neapolitan prophet of the essential unity of\r\nall things. The same vehemence which we have remarked in Neapolitan\r\nmen of letters--Pontano, Tansillo, Basile--combines in Bruno with\r\nthe metaphysical instinct of the race to form a poet-philosopher, as\r\nincoherent as if he had just emerged from the Sibyl’s cave, but full\r\nof the most surprising intuitions, instinct with the germs of modern\r\nthought and discovery. His very incoherence seems a claim to reverence;\r\nit does not convey the impression of intellectual inadequacy, but\r\nrather of an inspired message transcending mortal powers of speech. A\r\nchastened taste cannot but be offended by the drollery and burlesque\r\nwhich, like a true Neapolitan, Bruno blends with daring speculation and\r\nserious reflection, as well as by his gaudy rhetoric and exaggerated\r\neuphuism; yet Symonds is right in observing that “when the real divine\r\nœstrum descends upon him the thought is simple, the diction direct;\r\nthe attitude of mind and the turn of expression are singularly living,\r\nsurprisingly modern.”\r\n\r\nLike Galileo, Bruno chose the dialogue as the most convenient form of\r\npropagating his opinions, and unlike most contemporary philosophers,\r\nclaims a place among vernacular writers. In his _Spaccio della\r\nBestia Trionfante_ and his comedy _Il Candelaio_ he is satirical;\r\nmetaphysically speculative in the _Cena delle Ceneri_, _Della Causa_,\r\nand _Dell’ Infinito Universo_; but perhaps the most interesting of\r\nhis works is _Gli Eroici Furori_, dedicated to Sir Philip Sidney, a\r\ndithyramb in prose and verse on the progress of the soul to union with\r\nthe Divinity. It may be too much to say with the English translator\r\nthat in this remarkable book the author “lays down the basis for the\r\nreligion of thought and science”; but it is true that the ordinary\r\necclesiastical ideals are thrust aside, and progress in truth,\r\nknowledge, and justice declared to be the end of man. If many had\r\nthought so, none had said it so openly. Bruno, however, never learned\r\nto observe, and remained all his life the metaphysician and the poet.\r\nChief among his intuitions, after his perception of the unity of all\r\nexistence, must be placed his instinctive recognition of the immense\r\nrevolution which the acceptance of the Copernican theory must effect in\r\nreligious belief. It is probable that he thus alarmed the priesthood\r\nere he could arouse the laity, and that to him must be ascribed the\r\npersecution of Galileo, nearly a century after Copernicus had been\r\npermitted to dedicate his treatise to the Pope.\r\n\r\nBruno’s own martyrdom had preceded Galileo’s; he suffered death in\r\nFebruary 1600, after a life of constant flight and exile, which at\r\none time brought him to England, where he lectured at Oxford and\r\nbecame Sidney’s friend, and latterly of imprisonment. His fate is a\r\nstriking illustration of the dismal though inevitable change that had\r\ncome over the spirit of the ecclesiastical rulers: a Renaissance Pope\r\nwould probably have protected him. His name long seemed forgotten,\r\nand his writings obliterated. Early in the eighteenth century\r\ninterest in him revived, as is shown by the collection of his works\r\nin Lord Sunderland’s library. Brucker gave an intelligible digest\r\nof his opinions; Schelling avowedly sought inspiration from him;\r\nColeridge names him with Dante and Ariosto as one of the three most\r\nrepresentative Italians; and at present, even though he be chiefly\r\nefficient through his influence on more disciplined geniuses and more\r\nsystematic thinkers, the world has hardly a more striking example of\r\nthe truth, “The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become\r\nthe head of the corner.”\r\n\r\nAs Bruno is the personification of martyrdom in the cause of\r\nphilosophical speculation, another Neapolitan philosopher of the age,\r\nthe Dominican TOMMASO CAMPANELLA (1568-1639) represents martyrdom for\r\nthe sake of country. Campanella is not only a less important figure\r\nthan Bruno, but less sane and practical. With all his extravagance,\r\nBruno is no visionary; if he sometimes appears obscure and confused,\r\nthe defect is not in the brain, but in the tongue. Campanella, though\r\nendowed with profound ideas, was a visionary who based his hopes\r\nof delivering his country from the Spanish yoke on predictions of\r\nthe millennium, to be fulfilled by the advent of the Turks, and was\r\nsufficiently paradoxical to dream of a perfect republic in the kingdom\r\nof Naples. But this alliance of mental unsoundness with extraordinary\r\nintelligence renders him deeply interesting; unlike the frank and\r\ncandid Bruno, he is one of the _problematische Naturen_ who, as Goethe\r\njustly says, perpetually attract mankind. The flower of his life\r\n(1599-1625) was spent in prison, and some of it in torture, on account\r\nof a conspiracy which, after all the investigations of Signor Amabile,\r\nremains in many respects obscure, but which was undoubtedly designed to\r\nfree Naples from the yoke, not only of Spain, but of Rome.\r\n\r\nReleased at length, Campanella successively found an asylum at Rome\r\nand at Paris, where he died in 1639. As his captivity became milder,\r\nhe had been permitted to write, and to receive visits from friends,\r\nthrough whom his works found their way to the public. They are mostly\r\nof a political character. The chief, _De Sensu et Magia Naturali_, is\r\na curious blending of philosophy and occultism; another, a defence of\r\nGalileo, does him honour, even though he afterwards changed his view;\r\nbut another, _De Monarchia Universali_, seeks to revive the mediæval\r\nidea of the universal Church and the universal Empire, substituting\r\nSpain for Germany. Until the rediscovery of his poems, his literary\r\nreputation principally rested upon one of his slightest productions,\r\nhis _City of the Sun_, an Utopian picture of a perfect community. It\r\ncontains a remarkable anticipation of the steamboat: “They possess\r\nrafts and triremes which go over the waters without rowers or the force\r\nof the wind, but by a marvellous contrivance. And other vessels they\r\nhave which are moved by the winds.”\r\n\r\nCampanella’s claims as a vernacular writer rest entirely upon his\r\npoems, of which there are said to have been seven books. With the\r\nexception of some extracted from the documents of his trial by the\r\ndiligence of Signor Amabile, all that remain are the sonnets printed\r\nin Germany by his disciple, Tobias Adami, in 1622, and forgotten\r\nuntil their republication by Orelli, in 1834. But for these pieces\r\nwe should not know the real Campanella, whom they exhibit in a more\r\nfavourable light, even as a thinker, than does the brilliant intuition,\r\nchequered with gross credulity, of his professedly philosophical\r\nwritings. Like Michael Angelo’s, they are rather hewn than written--the\r\nutterances of a powerful intellect and a passionate heart seeking to\r\nexpress themselves through a medium but imperfectly mastered, hence\r\nvehement, abrupt, contorted even to the verge of absurdity, but full\r\nof substance, and as remote as possible from the polished inanity\r\nwhich is so frequently a reproach to the Italian sonnet. Addington\r\nSymonds, wrestling with Campanella as Campanella wrestled with his own\r\nlanguage, has produced excellent translations, accompanied by a careful\r\ncommentary. “That this sonnet,” he says of the following, “should have\r\nbeen written by a Dominican monk, in a Neapolitan prison, in the first\r\nhalf of the seventeenth century, is truly noteworthy:”\r\n\r\n      _The people is a beast of muddy brain\r\n        That knows not its own force, and therefore stands\r\n        Loaded with wood and stone; the powerless hands\r\n      Of a mere child guide it with bit and rein.\r\n      One kick would be enough to break the chain;\r\n        But the beast fears, and what the child demands\r\n        It does; nor its own terror understands,\r\n      Confused and stupefied by bugbears vain.\r\n      Most wonderful! with its own hand it ties\r\n        And gags itself--gives itself death and war\r\n        For pence doled out by kings from its own store.\r\n      Its own are all things between earth and heaven;\r\n        But this it knows not, and if one arise\r\n        To tell this truth, it kills him unforgiven._\r\n\r\nSome of Campanella’s other sonnets are very striking, especially his\r\nimpassioned remonstrance with the free Swiss for hiring themselves out\r\nto Italian despots. His religious pieces are characterised by a devout\r\ntone, and an unshakeable reliance upon Providence. His creed, like\r\nBruno’s, is pantheistic. The same is the case with another Neapolitan\r\nthinker of less importance, GIULIO CESARE VANINI (1585-1626), whose\r\nmisunderstood pantheism caused him to be burned at Toulouse, the\r\nmost intolerant city in France. His writings are in Latin, but so\r\ncharacteristically Italian in spirit as to deserve the attention of\r\nItalian students. Out of many which he composed, only two were printed.\r\nThe _Amphitheatre_ is, in the opinion of Mr. Owen (_Sceptics of the\r\nItalian Renaissance_), decidedly orthodox, the _Dialogues_ are as\r\ndecidedly free-thinking, but it is not always quite clear how far the\r\nauthor is speaking in his own person.\r\n\r\nWhile these adventurous speculators were infusing a ferment into the\r\nquiescent thought of their day, the edifice of modern jurisprudence\r\nwas receiving important additions from Alberico Gentili, a Protestant\r\nexile, happily in safety at Oxford, whose works, nevertheless,\r\nbelong rather to moral science than to literature. Much at the same\r\ntime prose literature was enriched by the ethical prolusions of the\r\nmost distinguished poet of the age. Though suffering from delusions\r\nsometimes amounting to frenzy, Tasso’s brain was clear on all subjects\r\nto which these delusions did not extend. He could reason powerfully\r\nand gracefully on any question of taste or morals, arrange his ideas\r\nwith symmetry, and support his views with appropriate quotations. The\r\nform which he adopted was the dialogue, requiring not only judgment\r\nand memory, but an accurate discrimination between the interlocutors,\r\nwhich he always maintains. Even the discourse with his familiar spirit,\r\nalthough composed in the hospital for lunatics, and containing many\r\nfantastic notions, is consecutive and rational. It is perhaps the most\r\ninteresting of any, from its close relation to the writer; although\r\nalmost as much may be said for the _Gonzaga_, in which Tasso celebrates\r\nthe noble conduct of his father in preferring public duty to private\r\ninterest; and the _Paterfamilias_, in which he describes a personal\r\nadventure. His other dialogues, all models of elegance and urbanity,\r\nusually treat of those virtues which enter most especially into the\r\ncharacter of a gentleman, and his own bad success at courts does not\r\ndiscourage him from tendering advice to courtiers.\r\n\r\nA more powerful intellect if a less accomplished pen than Tasso’s\r\nforms a connecting link between the science, alike moral and physical,\r\nand the historical erudition of the age. PIETRO SARPI (1552-1623)\r\nwould in our day have been a great natural philosopher; and in fact,\r\nnotwithstanding his profound knowledge both of theology and canon\r\nlaw, his reputation long principally rested upon his experiments\r\nand researches in optics, anatomy, and other natural sciences. Paul\r\nthe Fifth’s aggression upon Sarpi’s native Venice in a matter of\r\necclesiastical jurisdiction summoned the modest friar to public\r\nlife, and after the triumphant issue of the controversy in which\r\nhe had borne the chief part, he turned to write the history of the\r\nmomentous assembly which had so deeply affected the character of the\r\nChurch of Rome for good and ill--the Council of Trent. As a liberal\r\nthinker, whose creed approached without quite attaining the Protestant\r\nstandpoint, he was naturally hostile to a convocation which had\r\nstereotyped so many corruptions; while as an ecclesiastical statesman\r\nhe was well able to penetrate the worldly motives which had actuated\r\nits conveners from first to last. The substantial truth of his view\r\nof it is generally admitted; it remains a question how far he has\r\ndealt conscientiously with his materials. The equitable Ranke subjects\r\nboth him and the antagonistic historian, Cardinal Sforza Pallavicino,\r\nto a close scrutiny, and finds himself unable to entirely acquit or\r\ncondemn either of them. Both have frequently displayed a praiseworthy\r\nfairness under strong temptation to garble the documents before them,\r\nbut neither has always resisted the inducement to magnify or minimise\r\nevidence in accordance with his prepossessions. Sarpi’s main fault is a\r\ndisposition to interpret every document in the light of his own times,\r\nwhen the pretensions of the Papacy had greatly risen, and its spirit\r\nhad become more inflexible and despotic. This, however it may detract\r\nfrom the value of his history, was pardonable in one who had taken\r\na leading part in resisting the most arrogant of the Popes, and had\r\nbeen left for dead by assassins, suborned, as generally believed, by\r\nthe Papal court. As an advocate, Sarpi is far superior to his verbose\r\nthough often ingenious antagonist; as an historian, Ranke places him\r\nimmediately after Machiavelli. As a man, he appears sublimed by study\r\nand suffering into an incarnation of pure intellect, passionless\r\nexcept in his zeal for truth and freedom and his devotion to the\r\nRepublic. “Let us,” he nobly said when the Pope hurled his interdict at\r\nVenice--“let us be Venetians first and Christians afterwards.”\r\n\r\nThe secular historians of the period are very numerous, but, with the\r\nexception of the Latinist Strada, only two have attained a durable\r\ncelebrity. Enrico Caterino Davila (1576-1631), who had become well\r\nacquainted with French affairs by military service in the wars of\r\nreligion, wrote the history of these contests from 1558 to 1598\r\n“with Venetian sagacity and soldierly brevity.” He wants few of the\r\nqualifications of an excellent historian, and his history is placed\r\nnot far below that of Guicciardini, to which, indeed, it is preferred\r\nby Macaulay. He is accused, however, of affecting more penetration\r\nthan he possessed into the secret counsels of princes. Cardinal Guido\r\nBentivoglio’s history of the revolt of the Low Countries against the\r\nSpaniards (1558-1609) is necessarily defective as coming from the\r\nwrong side. Such a history could not be adequately written without\r\nsympathy with its heroes and comprehension of the principles involved,\r\nneither of which could be expected from a Papal nuncio. Bentivoglio\r\nnevertheless writes with reasonable impartiality, and is well informed\r\non the exterior of the transactions he records, though utterly blind\r\nto their real significance. His style is most agreeable. His relation\r\nof his mission as nuncio, with speculations on the possibility of\r\nsuppressing the Reformation in England and elsewhere, is perhaps more\r\nintrinsically valuable than his history; and his memoirs of his own\r\ncareer at the Papal court, though necessarily worded with great reserve\r\nand caution, are both entertaining and instructive. He was born in\r\n1577, and died in conclave in 1644, just as he seemed about to be\r\nelected Pope; done to death, Nicius Erythræus affirms, by the snoring\r\nof the Cardinal in the next cell, which deprived him of sleep for\r\neleven successive nights.\r\n\r\nAll the authors we have mentioned, though for the most part writing in\r\nthe seventeenth century, were born in the sixteenth. The seventeenth\r\ncentury was far advanced towards its close ere it had produced a single\r\nprose-writer of literary importance, although some of its numerous\r\npenmen were interesting for their characters or the circumstances of\r\ntheir lives. Bartoli’s _History of the Society of Jesus_ is badly\r\nexecuted, but important from its subject. GREGORIO LETI was the most\r\nrepresentative figure, personifying the spirit of revolt against\r\ntyranny spiritual and political. Born at Milan in 1630, he emigrated\r\nto Geneva, became a Protestant, and, after a roving life, eventually\r\nsettled at Amsterdam, where he died historiographer of the city\r\nin 1701. He had already constituted himself a historiographer and\r\nbiographer general, writing the lives of kings, princes, and governors,\r\nand depicting the rise and fall of states, as fast as bookseller could\r\ncommission, or printer put into type. Yet he is not a hack writer, but\r\nhas an individuality of his own, and although his works are devoid\r\nof scientific worth, they served a useful purpose in their day by\r\nasserting freedom of speech. Their value is in proportion to the degree\r\nin which they subserve this purpose; the most important, therefore,\r\nare his lives of Sixtus V. and of Innocent the Tenth’s rapacious and\r\nimperious niece, Olimpia Maldachini. Ranke has clearly shown that the\r\nformer, which has done more than any other book to determine popular\r\nopinion regarding Sixtus, is mainly derived from MS. authorities of\r\nlittle value; which proves that Leti did not invent, but also that he\r\ndid not discriminate.\r\n\r\nSeveral other writers approached Leti’s type, of whom Tomasi, the\r\nauthor of a very uncritical life of Cæsar Borgia, may be taken as\r\na specimen. Two emigrant Italians, Siri and Marana, ministered\r\nsuccessfully to the growing appetite for news and political criticism,\r\nsoon to engender regular journalism; the former by his _Mercurio_,\r\npublished irregularly from 1644 to 1682; the latter by his ingenious\r\n_Turkish Spy_. Ferrante Pallavicino enlivened the general dulness\r\nby his _Divorzio Celeste_, a conception worthy of Lucian, though\r\nnot worked out as Lucian would have wrought it, and other satires\r\nwhich eventually cost him his life. TRAJANO BOCCALINI, nearer the\r\ncommencement of the century, had treated political as well as literary\r\naffairs with freedom in his _News from Parnassus_, in which he\r\nprofessed to impart information respecting transactions in the kingdom\r\nof Apollo. The fiction was greatly admired in its day, translated into\r\nmost European languages, and probably exerted considerable influence\r\nupon Quevedo, Swift, and Addison. Boccalini also distinguished himself\r\nas a commentator on Tacitus, a writer much studied at this epoch of\r\ngeneral gloom and discouragement, and as the author of an exposure of\r\nthe weakness of the Spanish monarchy, which is said to have occasioned\r\nhis assassination.\r\n\r\nThe one writer, however, whom it is possible to admire without\r\nqualification, and who has preserved his freshness to our own day, is\r\na traveller, PIETRO DELLA VALLE, who between 1614 and 1626 explored\r\nTurkey, Egypt, Syria, Persia, and part of India. Apart from the\r\nprejudices inevitable in his age and country, Della Valle is the\r\nmodel of an observant and sagacious voyager, and the letters in which\r\nhis observations are recorded form most delightful reading. Later in\r\nthe century excellent letters on scientific subjects were written by\r\nMagalotti and Redi. The illustrious naturalists who in some measure\r\nredeemed the intellectual barrenness of the epoch, do not fall within\r\nthe domain of literary history, which, except for some poets, is one\r\nof ever-augmenting inanity and insipidity, culminating in absolute\r\nsterility. A second Greece had been enslaved, but this time the fierce\r\nconqueror refused to be himself led into captivity. Spain and the\r\nPapacy and their victim were equally useless to culture, which would\r\nhave perished from the earth had it still been confined to the fair land\r\n\r\n      _Begirt by wall of Alp and azure sea,\r\n      And cloven by the ridges Apennine._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX\r\n                 THE POETRY OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe blight that fell upon Italian literature near the close of the\r\nsixteenth century was in the main to be ascribed to tyranny, temporal\r\nand spiritual. Yet there was another source of ill for which neither\r\nmonarch nor priest was responsible: this was the malady which\r\nnecessarily befalls every form of literature and art when the bounds\r\nof perfection have been reached, the craving to improve upon what is\r\nincapable of improvement; first, perhaps, distinctly evinced in this\r\nage by the Spanish bishop Guevara, author of the _Dial of Princes_\r\n(1529), who invented what he called the _estilo alto_, which, if not\r\nabsolutely the predominant, had by the end of the century become a\r\nconspicuous element in every European literature. The true course\r\nwould have been a new departure like that made by the Spanish and\r\nDutch masters when Italian art had fulfilled its mission; but this\r\nrequires not only genius, but the concurrence of favourable social and\r\npolitical circumstances, without which nothing is possible but servile\r\nrepetition or preposterous exaggeration. Genius born amid inauspicious\r\nsurroundings is more prone to elect the latter than the former\r\nalternative, and the greater the natural gift, the more outrageous the\r\nabuse likely to be made of it.\r\n\r\nSuch epidemics are of no unfrequent occurrence in the history of\r\nevery literature; but at the beginning of the seventeenth century the\r\nplague was common to all, and it was but natural that none should\r\nsuffer so severely as that which had hitherto been the model of good\r\ntaste. There seems no good reason for attributing this particular\r\naffliction to Spanish influence. Spain had her Gongora, as Italy her\r\nMarini, but there is no evidence that either taught the other. It was\r\na prevalent malady, which left Italian prose by no means unaffected.\r\nCardinal Bentivoglio, himself a model of pure and simple composition in\r\nprose, though in verse an admirer of Marini, says of the poet Ciampoli,\r\nredactor of briefs under Clement VIII., that his style would have been\r\nin place if he had been inditing an heroic poem. Ciampoli’s poetry\r\nwas not likely to be more chastened than his prose; and in truth the\r\ndetermination to dazzle and astonish at any cost was inevitably most\r\nconspicuous in the branch of literature where a divine transport, when\r\nreal and not simulated, is rightly held to excuse many lapses from\r\nabsolute purity of diction; and where, as was also to be expected,\r\nthe arch offender was a man of genuine gifts, who with more natural\r\nrefinement and moral earnestness might have regenerated the literature\r\nof his country, but whose false brilliancy only served to lure it\r\nfurther astray.\r\n\r\nIt is the best apology of GIOVANNI BATTISTA MARINI (1569-1625) to\r\nhave been born a Neapolitan. From the days of Statius till now,\r\nthese vehement children of the South have been great improvisers.\r\nCould we look upon Marini in this light, we should find little but\r\nhis voluptuousness to censure, and should be compelled to admire him\r\nin some measure as a remarkable phenomenon, only lamenting that his\r\ncontemporaries should have mistaken a _lusus naturæ_ for an inspired\r\ngenius, a calculating boy for a Newton or a Galileo. It might indeed\r\nhave been better for Marini if he had trusted more to his natural\r\nfaculty for improvisation. “His first strokes,” says Settembrini,\r\n“are sometimes beautiful, and if he left them as they were all would\r\nbe well, but he touches and retouches until they are quite blurred.”\r\nThis refers to the descriptions in his _Adone_ (1623), a poem which\r\nis nothing but description. Adonis does nothing, but is carried\r\ninvoluntarily through a series of situations contrived to display the\r\npictorial power of the poet. The showman makes the puppet dance, and\r\nthe puppet returns the compliment. There is no story, no moral, no\r\ncharacter, no inner unity, nothing but forty-five thousand lines of\r\nword-painting, rich and brilliant indeed, but commonplace in so far\r\nas the poet sees nothing invisible to ordinary eyes, and evinces no\r\noriginality in his manner of regarding man and nature.\r\n\r\nSuch merely verbal beauty must inevitably satiate, and Marini has\r\nexperienced more neglect, and even contempt, than many men of far\r\ninferior faculty. In his own day he carried all before him, and was\r\neven more admired in France than in Italy. It is at least to his credit\r\nnot to have undertaken his gorgeous but empty _Adone_ until he had\r\nconvinced himself of his inability to vie with Tasso in a nobler form\r\nof epic. He also composed one really dignified poem on the deplorable\r\ncondition of Italy (attributed, however, by many to Fulvio Testi),\r\nand poured forth a flood of idyllic and bucolic, marine, erotic, and\r\nlyrical poetry, not devoid of striking beauties, but so disfigured by\r\nconceits as to be necessarily condemned to oblivion upon the revival\r\nof a purer taste. In some respects he might be compared to the Cowleys\r\nand Crashaws of Charles the First’s time; but he is physical, while\r\nthey are metaphysical; his conceits are less far-fetched and ingenious\r\nthan theirs, and few of them either could or would have produced his\r\nlicentious, but, in an artistic point of view, admirable _Pastorella_.\r\nMarini’s influence on the contemporary poetry of his own country was\r\nvery great; but the two or three men of genius remained unaffected\r\nby him, and the names of his multitudinous imitators are not worth\r\npreserving. His life, though chequered by scrapes and quarrels, was on\r\nthe whole prosperous, and the patronage of the French court made him\r\nindependent of the petty princes of Italy. He had bitter enemies in\r\nGasparo Murtola, a poet who would be forgotten but for his and Marini’s\r\nmutual lampoons, and Tommaso Stigliani, a more considerable personage,\r\nwho had enjoyed the great honour of being run through the body by the\r\nhistorian Davila, and whose early promise had drawn a sonnet from\r\nTasso, remarkable for the hint it affords that Tasso himself had\r\nprojected an epic upon Columbus:\r\n\r\n      _Thy song Orphean, able to placate\r\n        The Stygian thrones, and wailing shades appease,\r\n        Stiglian, doth so upon my spirit seize,\r\n      Mine own in its compare I humbly rate.\r\n      And if like Autumn with thy April mate\r\n        As promised by such harbingers as these,\r\n        Thou’lt pass the pillared bounds of Hercules,\r\n      And safe to utmost Thule navigate.\r\n      Now, parted from the crowd, intrepid go,\r\n        Scaling steep Helicon, thy high desire,\r\n        No more in dread to wander to and fro.\r\n      There swaying from a cypress hangs my lyre;\r\n        Salute it in my name, and bid it know\r\n        That Time and Fortune for my ill conspire._\r\n\r\nThe peculiar appropriateness of Tasso’s compliment arises from the\r\nfact that Stigliani was then engaged upon an epic on the discovery of\r\nAmerica, which was far from justifying Torquato’s predictions.\r\n\r\nThe style of Marini, however, was not allowed to bear unchallenged\r\nsway. The first place in lyrical poetry was boldly claimed by, and\r\nby many accorded to, another bard, whose personal and poetical\r\nidiosyncrasies stood in strong contrast to the Neapolitan’s. GABRIELLO\r\nCHIABRERA (1552-1637), a native of Savona, was a man of antique\r\nmould, haughty, aspiring, and self-sufficing. His youth was spent at\r\nRome. Jealous of his honour, he found himself, as he tells us in his\r\nautobiography, necessitated to wash out sundry affronts in blood, which\r\nhe accomplished to his satisfaction, but whether in single combat or\r\nin other fashion he does not explicitly say. Retired for safety to\r\nhis native Ligurian town, and digesting the large assortment of ideas\r\nwhich he had brought away with him from the literary circles of Rome,\r\nhe hit upon the great discovery of his life, that the Italian canzone\r\nneeded to be reformed upon a Greek model. It really was a discovery\r\nwhich changed the whole course of his literary activity--of no such\r\nimportance as that of the need of a closer observation of nature which\r\nWordsworth deduced from noticing the blackness of a leaf outlined\r\nagainst a sunny sky, but still a genuine discovery. Its value lay\r\nnot so much in its abstract worth or in any real assimilation of the\r\nspirit of Greek poetry by Chiabrera, but in an endeavour after a high\r\nstandard, which, even when misdirected, proved the best corrective of\r\nthe inanity and effeminacy to which the Italian canzone had become\r\nprone.\r\n\r\nChiabrera might be somewhat conventional in style and barren in\r\nthought: he was all the more a precious antidote to the dissolute\r\nlusciousness of a Marini, and his example exercised a salutary\r\ninfluence throughout the whole of the seventeenth century. So late as\r\n1740, Spence, travelling in Italy, was told that the Italian lyrical\r\npoets of the day were divisible into Petrarchists and Chiabrerists. The\r\npopularity of so bold an innovator, and the honours and distinctions\r\nshowered upon him by princes and potentates, are creditable to the age.\r\nHe wrote his brief autobiography at eighty, and died at eighty-five,\r\nexulting to the last in his sanity of mind and body; distinguished\r\nalso, according to Rossi (Nicius Erythræus), as the ugliest of the\r\npoets: “Quis enim qui ejus faciem aspexisset, arbitratus esset, ex\r\nillius ore subnigro, tetrico, invenusto, tam candidula, tam vinula, tam\r\nvenustula carmina posse prodere?” A man congenial to Wordsworth, who\r\nhas translated some of his stately metrical epitaphs with corresponding\r\ndignity.[20] He has many traits of those great modern masters of form,\r\nLandor and Platen, but, though no mean sculptor of speech, falls as\r\nmuch behind them in perfection of classic mould as he surpasses them in\r\nproductiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\nChiabrera wrote several epics, dramas, poems on sacred history, and\r\nother pieces, and the mass of his poetry is of formidable extent; but\r\napart from his _Sermoni_, felicitous imitations of Horace, he lives\r\nsolely by his lyrics. These fall into two classes, which he would have\r\ndescribed as Pindaric and Anacreontic. The former are set compositions\r\nof great pomp and magnificence; not like Marini’s poems, depending\r\nupon verbal beauty alone, but upon a real if formal grandeur of style.\r\nThey are less like the notes of Apollo’s lyre than orchestras of all\r\nsorts of instruments, “flute, violin, bassoon,” but more particularly\r\nbassoon. They are splendidly sonorous, and exhibit great art in\r\nheightening ordinary ideas by magnificent diction. Of the wild,\r\nuntutored graces of the woods and fields they have absolutely nothing;\r\ntheir sphere is the court, save for the feeling which Chiabrera, as\r\nbecomes a Ligurian, occasionally manifests for the sea; and the ideas\r\nare seldom absolutely novel, though they often seem so. But there is\r\ntrue elevation of thought and majesty of diction: a lyrical afflatus\r\nseems to descend upon the poet and whirl him on, sped, in the absence\r\nof a really inspiring subject, by his own excitement, as a courser is\r\nurged along by the thunder of his own hoofs. Yet there is no factitious\r\nemotion, the theme is really for the moment everything to the poet,\r\nwhile he remains sufficiently master of himself to turn every strong\r\npoint to the best account.\r\n\r\nLike the surviving lyrics of his model Pindar, his odes are usually\r\naddressed to particular persons or prompted by some event. Among the\r\nbest are the long series he poured forth on occasion of the trifling\r\nvictories gained by the Italian galleys over the Turks, which prove\r\nhow fine a patriotic poet he might have been if his age had given him\r\nanything better to celebrate. His Anacreontics precisely correspond to\r\nhis Pindarics, brilliant effusions with more glitter than glow, but\r\ningenious, felicitous, and transcending mere rhetoric by the exquisite\r\nmusic of the versification. Chiabrera is not an Italian Pindar or\r\nAnacreon, and his natural gift for poetry was inferior to Marini’s; but\r\nhe is entitled to the great honour of having barred out by a strong\r\ndike the flood of false taste, and having conferred dignity upon a most\r\nunpropitious age of Italian literature.\r\n\r\nChiabrera’s mantle fell upon Count FULVIO TESTI (1593-1646), in some\r\nrespects a more genuine poet, though his inferior in splendour of\r\nlanguage and harmony of versification, and like him infertile in ideas\r\nand contracted in his outlook upon the world. Testi was nevertheless\r\nan interesting personage, picturesque in the style of Rembrandt or\r\nCaravaggio, an unquiet spirit, haughty, moody, vindictive. Under a free\r\ngovernment he might have been a great citizen, but the circumstances of\r\nhis age left him no other sphere than court or diplomatic employment.\r\nHe was not the man to run easily in harness, and spent his life in\r\nlosing and regaining the favour of the Este princes, now come down to\r\nbe Dukes of Modena, but still with places and pensions in their gift,\r\nand died in prison, just as, if the Duke may be believed, he was on\r\nthe point of being released. If so, the cause of his disgrace was\r\nprobably nothing graver than his wish to quit the Duke’s service. In\r\nany case, the tale of his having been secretly decapitated to appease\r\nthe resentment of Cardinal Antonio Barberini, satirised in his famous\r\ncanzone, _Ruscelletto orgoglioso_, seems to be a mere legend.\r\n\r\nThis canzone is undoubtedly one of the finest lyrics in the Italian\r\nlanguage, magnificent alike in its description of the swollen rivulet\r\nand in its application to the inflated upstart. The rest of Testi’s\r\nbetter compositions resemble it; they are odes stately in diction\r\nand sonorous in versification, fine examples of the grand style in\r\npoetry, and proving what dignity of style can effect even without any\r\nconsiderable opulence or striking novelty of thought. They are usually\r\non subjects personal to himself, sometimes depicting the miseries of\r\ncourt life with the feeling that comes from experience, sometimes\r\naffecting a philosophical tranquillity to which he was really a\r\nstranger. One stands out from the rest, the poem which he addressed in\r\nhis youth to the Duke of Savoy, exhorting him to deliver Italy from\r\nthe Spaniards. Testi was not alone in the prophetic foresight that\r\nthe redemption of Italy would come from Savoy. Campanella, Chiabrera,\r\nand others of the best Italians of the day shared it with him, but no\r\nother has given it such direct and eloquent expression. The genius of\r\nItaly appears in vision to the poet, enumerates her wrongs, denounces\r\nher oppressor, and calls for vengeance in a series of most animated\r\noctaves, equally impressive and persuasive.\r\n\r\nMarini’s school continued to dominate literary circles, although Rossi\r\nassures us that Testi’s simplicity was more acceptable to readers\r\nat large. “The sun,” says Vernon Lee, “cooled itself in the waters\r\nof rivers which were on fire; the celestial sieve, resplendent with\r\nshining holes, was swept by the bristly back of the Apennines; love\r\nwas an infernal heaven and a celestial hell, it was burning ice and\r\nfreezing fire, and was inspired by ladies made up entirely of coral,\r\ngold thread, lilies, roses, and ivory, on whose lips sat Cupids\r\nshooting arrows which were snakes.” Poetry worthy of the name seemed\r\nextinct after Testi’s death, and the literature of England being then\r\nunknown beyond her own borders, the sceptre over every department of\r\nintellectual activity except science passed into the hand of France.\r\nAfter a while, however, signs of revival became apparent. The writers\r\nwho restored to Italy some share of her ancient glory were all strongly\r\ninfluenced by Chiabrera.\r\n\r\nThe first of these in order of time was a man who would have been\r\nfamous if he had never written a verse, FRANCESCO REDI (1626-99), the\r\nillustrious physician and naturalist. One would scarcely have expected\r\nthis eager scrutiniser of nature to have come forward as a Bacchanalian\r\nlaureate; but certain it is that, neglecting the more imposing side\r\nof Chiabrera’s poetical work, Redi applied himself to develop the\r\ndithyramb in its strict sense of a Bacchic song. Chiabrera had given\r\nexcellent examples of this on a small scale; but Redi completely\r\ndistanced him with his _Bacchus in Tuscany_, where the jolly god,\r\nreturned from his Indian conquest, for the benefit of Ariadne passes\r\nin review literally and figuratively all the wines of Tuscany, with\r\nsuch consequences as is reasonable to expect. The literary character of\r\nthe piece cannot be better described than by Salfi, the continuator of\r\nGinguené, as “consisting in the enthusiasm which passes rapidly from\r\none theme to another, and, seeming to say nothing but what it chooses,\r\nsays, in effect, nothing but what it should.” Dryden evidently had\r\nit in mind when he wrote _Alexander’s Feast_, and the difficulties\r\nof translation have been surprisingly overcome by Leigh Hunt. Redi’s\r\nsonnets are also remarkable, occasionally tame in subject or disfigured\r\nby conceits, but in general nobly thought and nobly expressed, with\r\na strong Platonic element. They nearly all relate to Love, and fall\r\ninto two well-marked divisions, one upbraiding him as the source of\r\nperpetual torment, the other celebrating him as the symbol of Divinity,\r\nand the chief agent by which man is raised above himself. The latter\r\nthought has seldom been more finely expressed than in the following\r\npair of sonnets, the first of which is translated by Mr. Gosse:\r\n\r\n      _Love is the Minstrel; for in God’s own sight,\r\n        The master of all melody, he stands,\r\n        And holds a golden rebeck in his hands,\r\n      And leads the chorus of the saints in light;\r\n      But ever and anon those chambers bright\r\n        Detain him not, for down to these low lands\r\n        He flies, and spreads his musical commands,\r\n      And teaches men some fresh divine delight.\r\n      For with his bow he strikes a single chord\r\n        Across a soul, and wakes in it desire\r\n        To grow more pure and lovely, and aspire\r\n      To that ethereal country where, outpoured\r\n      From myriad stars that stand before the Lord,\r\n        Love’s harmonies are like a flame of fire._\r\n\r\n      _If I am aught, it is Love’s miracle,\r\n        He to rough mass gave shape with forming file;\r\n        He, as youth bloomed in April’s sunny smile,\r\n      Came through the eyes within the heart to dwell.\r\n      My Lord and Master he, who bade expel\r\n        All sordid thought and apprehension vile,\r\n        Sweetness bestowed on rude unmellowed style,\r\n      And melody that shall be memorable.\r\n      My spirit at his call her pinions bent\r\n        To wing the heavenly realm where Time is not;\r\n        From star to star he beckoned, and she went:\r\n      By him my heart hath chosen for her lot\r\n        True honour whose renown shall ne’er be spent;\r\n        If aught my soul hath borne, ’twas he begot._\r\n\r\nPoets are often found to be gregarious. Redi had two chief friends\r\nat the Tuscan court--Menzini, of whom we shall have to speak, and\r\nFilicaja, who in an unpoetical age raised the Italian lyric to as\r\ngreat a height as it had ever attained in the Cinque Cento. VINCENZO\r\nFILICAJA (1642-1707) is one of the highest examples the world has seen\r\nof the academical poet, the man who is rarely hurried away by the god,\r\nbut who seriously and perseveringly follows poetry as an art, in whose\r\nbreast the sacred fire is always burning, but always needing to be\r\nstirred up. A grave, just magistrate, and a deeply religious man, he\r\nwas well constituted to sing events of such importance to the Christian\r\ncommonwealth as the deliverance of Vienna by Sobieski, and, from his\r\npoint of view, the conversion of Queen Christina. Tender, affectionate,\r\nand carrying with him the life-long wound of an unfortunate passion,\r\nhe was no less qualified to be the laureate of domestic sorrow, while\r\nhis elevation of mind lent uncommon dignity to many of his occasional\r\npieces, especially his sonnets. If only his scrolls smelt less of the\r\nlamp he might deserve Macaulay’s exaggerated praise as the greatest\r\nlyrist of modern times, supposing this expression to denote the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nThe great qualities of Filicaja are majesty and tenderness. The _non\r\nbene conveniunt nec in una sede morantur majestas et amor_ only applies\r\nto him in so far as these gifts, though dwelling in the same breast,\r\nare not often found united in the same poem. His canzoni possess\r\namplitude of form and pomp of diction, seldom or never bombastic,\r\nor transgressing the limits of good taste. From this the poet was\r\npreserved by his deep seriousness, to which anything like tinsel\r\nwas utterly abhorrent. He strongly felt the obligation to exert his\r\nutmost strength when writing on an important theme, as he usually did\r\nwhen he wrote at all. It is his manner to approach his subject from\r\na variety of sides, and make each the topic of a separate poem. Thus\r\nhis great cycle of odes on the relief of Vienna, perhaps the finest of\r\nhis works, consists of six separate productions, constituting a grand\r\nwhole, but any one of which could have stood perfectly well by itself.\r\nSuch a method of composition implies great deliberation, and Filicaja\r\nrarely conveys the impression of a seer or a bard. His thoughts are\r\nsometimes trite, but the feeling which gives them birth is always deep\r\nand sincere. The same is true of the best of his numerous sonnets, some\r\nof which rise to grandeur. By far the finest is the famous _Italia,\r\nItalia, a cui feò la sorte_, which is to Italian literature what\r\nMilton’s sonnet on the massacre of the Vaudois is to English:\r\n\r\n      _Italia, O Italia, doomed to wear\r\n        The fatal wreath of loveliness, and so\r\n        The record of illimitable woe\r\n      Branded for ever on thy brow to bear!\r\n      Would that less beauty or more vigour were\r\n        Thy heritage! that they who madly glow\r\n        For that which their own fury layeth low,\r\n      More terrible might find thee, or less fair!\r\n      Not from thine Alpine rampart should the horde\r\n        Of spoilers then descend, or crimson stain\r\n        Of rolling Po quench thirst of Gallic steed:\r\n      Nor should’st thou, girded with another’s sword,\r\n        Smite with a foreign arm, enslavement’s chain,\r\n        Victor or vanquished, equally thy meed._\r\n\r\nFilicaja, however, did not always compose in this majestic style.\r\nHe could be light and playful. Some of his sonnets, like those of\r\nTansillo and other writers of the Cinque Cento, strongly bring out the\r\ncharacteristic distinction between the Italian and the English sonnet,\r\nwhich is entirely in favour of the former. The English sonnet, even\r\nwhen dealing with a light theme, is apt to be ponderous. The Italian,\r\neven when serious, is tuneful, and buoyant on the wing.\r\n\r\nFilicaja fixed the model of the Italian canzone for a long time, for\r\nthe innovations of his successor ALESSANDRO GUIDI (1650-1712), a\r\nprotégé of Queen Christina, and one of the founders of the “Arcadia,”\r\nhad more admirers than imitators. They consisted in the irregularity\r\nand sometimes the disuse of rhyme, interesting as experiments, but\r\nunfavourable to the stately march of the most dignified form of lyrical\r\ncomposition. Guidi was nevertheless a fine poet, and manifests a\r\npeculiar fire and dignity when hymning the glories and tragedies of\r\nRome. He must have been a very ermine among authors, if it be true that\r\nhe died of disgust at a misprint in one of his books.\r\n\r\nThree other poets who did not aspire to the elevation of Filicaja and\r\nGuidi, aided to re-enthrone sound taste, and did honour to the end\r\nof the seventeenth century. BENEDETTO MENZINI (1646-1704), another\r\nprotégé of Christina’s, and in some sense a pupil of Redi, wrote\r\ncaustic satires, graceful Anacreontics, respectable odes, and an Art\r\nof Poetry as sound as could be expected from one whose knowledge of\r\nmodern literature was so limited. To see, more than half a century\r\nafter Shakespeare, the Solimano and the Torrismondo propounded as the\r\nhighest modern examples of tragic art certainly inspires cogitation\r\ntouching the serviceableness of the light within, supposing that light\r\nto be darkness. Within his limits, however, Menzini is most judicious,\r\nand his own compositions do credit to his maxims; witness the following\r\nkeen satiric apologue in sonnet form:\r\n\r\n\r\n      _A tender slip of laurel I of late\r\n        Implanted in fair soil, and Heaven besought\r\n        To prosper till it might, to fulness brought,\r\n      Enshade the brow august of Laureate;\r\n      And Zephyrus to boot did supplicate\r\n        To fan with soothing wing, lest harm in aught\r\n        By bitter breath of Boreas should be wrought,\r\n      Loosed from the cave where Æolus holds state.\r\n      Tardy and difficult, full well I know,\r\n        The upward striving of Apollo’s spray,\r\n        Matched with frail growths that lightly come and go;\r\n      Yet chide we not the fortunate delay,\r\n        If, when the bay is worthy of the brow,\r\n        Brow there be also worthy of the bay._\r\n\r\nCarlo Maria Maggi (1630-99), without soaring high, did excellent work\r\nin ode, sonnet, and madrigal. Francesco Lemene (1634-1704) was more\r\nambitious, but his tumid religious poetry has fallen into oblivion, and\r\nhe only lives by his pretty Anacreontics.\r\n\r\nAs the great questions which had divided the preceding century became\r\nsettled, and political interests narrowed more and more, the spirit\r\nof the age naturally turned to satire. Menzini is its best satirist;\r\nbut at an earlier period Chiabrera, Soldani, and the impetuous and\r\nunequal Salvator Rosa had exercised themselves in this department\r\nof literature, and the century’s last literary sensation was the\r\nsuccessive appearance of the Latin satires of Sergardi (Sectanus),\r\nmodels of composition, which for nearly a decade kept the reading\r\nportion of the Roman public in an uproar. It might have been thought\r\nthat comedy would have flourished, but some promising beginnings died\r\naway, while opera progressed steadily. Tragedies continued to be\r\nwritten on the classical system, but there was no power to breathe\r\nlife into the old forms, unless the great temporary success of\r\nProspero Bonarelli’s _Solimano_, which we have seen Menzini parallel\r\nwith Tasso’s _Torrismondo_, may be taken to denote an exception. The\r\n_Phillis of Scyros_ of Bonarelli’s brother Giudubaldo was the one\r\nachievement in pastoral drama. The novelette languished, and chivalric\r\nfiction had but one representative in Italy, the _Caloandro_ of\r\nGiuseppe Ambrogio Marini, an excellent romance nevertheless, ending\r\nwith five marriages, where monarchs and warriors play the part of the\r\nantiquated knights-errant, and so superior in sanity to the unwieldy\r\nfictions of the Clélie type that Caylus thought it worth translating\r\ninto French in the following century. The _Eudemia_ of J. V. Rossi\r\n(Nicius Erythræus), in Latin, is a good specimen of the _Argenis_ class\r\nof romances. The same author’s _Pinacotheca_, in three parts, a most\r\nentertaining repertory of biographies, chiefly more or less literary,\r\nof the early part of the century, is further remarkable as indicative\r\nof a perception of the growing needs of the world, and an unconscious\r\nforeshadowing of a culture as yet afar off. And this is broadly the\r\ncharacter of the seventeenth century in Italy, a poor and barren time\r\nif paralleled with the past, but pregnant with the seeds of future\r\nharvests, repressed for a time by ungenial circumstances. Comparing\r\nthe Italian literature of the seventeenth century with that of England\r\nand France, we see that all ran through substantially the same stages,\r\nbut that, while these are vigorous alike in their aberrations and\r\ntheir reforms, Italian literature is languid in both, a circumstance\r\nsufficiently accounted for by its absolute enslavement, and their\r\ncomparative freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] It is not improbable that the “three feet long and two feet wide,”\r\nwhich brought such ridicule upon Wordsworth, may be a reminiscence of\r\nChiabrera’s description of his house, “Di cui l’ampiezza venticinque\r\nbraccia Forse consume.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n                        THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century was a period of recovery for Italy. The ancient\r\nlustre of literature, indeed, was but feebly rekindled; and fine art,\r\nwith the exception of music, which rose to unexampled heights, sank\r\nlower and lower. But an invigorating breath pervaded the nation; men\r\nwrote and thought in comparative freedom; and if pedantry and frivolity\r\nstill reigned in many quarters, the sway of outrageous bad taste had\r\ndeparted. Political and spiritual tyranny were still enthroned, and\r\nreligion and politics could only be handled with great caution; yet\r\nreform was more hardy and oppression less assured than of yore. Italy\r\nrose slowly from her abasement, like a trodden flower resuming its\r\nerect attitude, bruised but not crushed, feeble but not inanimate,\r\nobeying a natural impulse by which she could not fail to right herself\r\nin time.\r\n\r\nThe chief cause of Italian regeneration, so far as peculiar to the\r\ncountry, and unconnected with that general movement towards liberty and\r\ntoleration which, originating in England, was gradually transforming\r\nEurope, was the disappearance of the Spanish dominion, which had for\r\ntwo centuries inflicted every political and spiritual evil upon Italy\r\nwithout conferring a single benefit in return. A Spanish dynasty did,\r\nindeed, in 1734 re-establish itself in the Two Sicilies, but no longer\r\na dynasty of viceroys; it regarded itself as Italian, and was served\r\nby Italian administrators. Lombardy slumbered under the comparatively\r\nbenign sway of Austria. There was as yet little patriotic resentment\r\nagainst foreign domination as such; Austria was inert and unaggressive,\r\nand Italy’s princes and people felt conscious of a great deliverance.\r\nIt was no time for violent intellectual exercise, but for quiet and\r\ngradual revival. The convalescing country could not be expected to\r\nvie with the intellectual development of England and France, but her\r\nprogress was in the same direction. Within the Alps, as beyond them,\r\nthe age, save in music, was unimaginative. It created little, but\r\nbrought much to light. Its most potent intellects, the Kants, Lessings,\r\nDiderots, Butlers, Humes, were turned towards criticism or moral\r\nscience. So it was in Italy, where the current of the most powerful\r\nthought ran strongly in the direction of history and jurisprudence,\r\nstate reform and public economy. Vico, Giannone, Beccaria, Filangieri,\r\nGenovesi, Galiani are its representatives. Closely allied to these,\r\nbut devoid of their originality, are the investigators of the past and\r\nthe critical lawgivers of their own day, the Muratoris, Crescimbenis,\r\nMaffeis, Mazzuchellis, and Tiraboschis. Nor must the academical\r\nmovement be left out of sight, which, if impotent to create good\r\nliterature, at all events kept its traditions alive. Lastly, the\r\ndevelopment of music reacted on the lyrical drama, which kindled the\r\nother branches of the dramatic art into activity, and for a time made\r\nthe Italian drama, tragic, comic, and operatic, the most interesting in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nAmong the philosophical writers who conferred so much distinction upon\r\nItaly in the eighteenth century, the first, both in order of time and\r\nof importance, was GIOVANNI BATTISTA VICO, a Neapolitan (1668-1744).\r\nVico’s life was uneventful. He devoted his youth to the study of\r\nmetaphysics and Roman law, spent some happy years in a tutorship in the\r\ncountry, and, returning to Naples, passed the remainder of his life in\r\na conflict with poverty, deriving most of his income from adulating the\r\ngreat in complimentary verses. A small professorship of rhetoric eked\r\nout this precarious means of subsistence, and when the Spanish dynasty\r\nsupplanted the Austrian in 1734, Charles III. conferred a pension upon\r\nhim, but the aged philosopher was already sinking into a condition\r\nof imbecility. It seems surprising that he should have been able to\r\npublish so many important and far from remunerative books.\r\n\r\nVico’s fame rests less upon any particular achievement than upon the\r\ngeneral impression which he produces as a man greatly in advance of his\r\nage. His superiority in almost every branch of investigation except\r\nphysical science, of which he knew little, arises from his unflinching\r\napplication of a principle which he was almost the first of moderns\r\nto recognise, that man is to be viewed collectively. All individuals,\r\nall societies, all sciences, are thus concatenated and regarded as\r\ndiverse aspects of a single all-comprehending unity. As a metaphysician\r\nand a jurist, Vico’s claims to attention are very high, but do not\r\nproperly fall within our scope. They are fully set forth by Professor\r\nFlint in his volume on Vico in Blackwood’s Philosophical Classics.\r\nWe can only treat of Vico where he comes into contact with history\r\nand literary criticism, as he does very remarkably in his criticisms\r\nupon Roman history and upon Homer. His investigations into Roman\r\njurisprudence showed him the untruth of the traditions of the Twelve\r\nTables, and starting from this point, he anticipated almost everything\r\nsubsequently brought forward by Niebuhr, although from his deficiency\r\nin exact philological knowledge his arguments were less conclusive.\r\nHis scepticism respecting Homer was also the result of speculation;\r\nbefore the ballads of the mediæval period had been compared with the\r\nHomeric poems, he pronounced on the internal evidence of the latter,\r\nthat they must be the work, not of a man, but of a nation. In both\r\ndepartments he may have gone too far, but his views are the divinations\r\nof an extraordinary genius. They are intimately connected with his\r\nspeculations on history, which anticipate the general drift of modern\r\nthought by tending to put nations into the place of individuals, and\r\nto represent history as the product of an inevitable sequence of\r\ndevelopment. These views greatly influenced Herder and Turgot, and,\r\nthrough them, Europe. Vico’s doctrine of the three stages through which\r\nhuman society passes was used, if it was not plagiarised, by Comte and\r\nSchelling.\r\n\r\nAnother great Neapolitan writer of the age, though working on a much\r\nsmaller scale than Vico, attracted more notice from contemporaries,\r\ninasmuch as Vico seemed to deal merely with abstract things, while\r\nPIETRO GIANNONE came into rough contact with vested interests.\r\nGiannone, born at Ischitella, in Apulia, May 1676, went to the\r\nNeapolitan bar, and made the legal and ecclesiastical history of\r\nthe kingdom his especial study. In his Civil History of the Kingdom\r\nof Naples (1723), the work of twenty years, he demonstrated the\r\nillegitimacy of the Papal claims to jurisdiction over Naples, with a\r\nlearning and research which, now that these claims are no longer heard\r\nof, maintain his works in request as one of the highest authorities\r\nupon mediæval law. The more ordinary qualities of a historian are not\r\nmanifested in the same measure, but Giannone’s place is something\r\nquite apart. The book was received with gratitude and delight by the\r\neducated part of the public; but the monks, secretly prompted by the\r\ncourt of Rome, raised an outcry against Giannone as an unbeliever in\r\nSt. Januarius, and he was compelled to fly the country. He found refuge\r\nsuccessively in Vienna, Venice, and Geneva; but having been tempted\r\ninto Savoy for the purpose of attending the Roman Catholic service, was\r\nseized and most iniquitously imprisoned by the King of Sardinia, the\r\nKing Charles of Browning’s drama, until his death in 1748, though he\r\nmaintained all the time an amicable correspondence with the King and\r\nhis minister D’Ormea. Notwithstanding the wrongs which he suffered from\r\nthe house of Savoy, he foresaw and foretold its greatness and service\r\nto the nation. He imitated Machiavelli by exhorting the Italians to\r\nmilitary discipline, and his principal work is epoch-making as a\r\nprecursor of the great movement which tended to subject the Church\r\nto the civil power in the latter half of the eighteenth century. He\r\nalso composed the _Triregno_, a review of the temporal power of the\r\nChurch in general, which was so effectually sequestrated as to have\r\nremained unpublished until 1895. It is not quite complete. Giannone’s\r\nautobiography, which comes down to a late period of his captivity, was\r\npublished for the first time in 1891.\r\n\r\nGiannone is rather a jurist than an historian, and the writers whose\r\naffinity to him is closest are not historians like Denina, but the\r\nlegists and economists, Beccaria, Filangieri, Genovesi, Galiani. Three\r\nof these distinguished men were Neapolitans, a circumstance significant\r\nalike of the lively genius of the people, and of the liberality of\r\nthe government under Charles the Third and his enlightened minister\r\nTanucci. The spirit of the Renaissance seemed to have returned in\r\nsome measure; but the drift was not now to the classical art and\r\nthe literature that had effected the spiritual emancipation of the\r\nformer age, but to new theories of human rights and duties, and to\r\nthe removal of restrictions from civic action and social intercourse.\r\nThere probably never was a time since the age of Marcus Aurelius\r\nwhen philosophers attained nearer to royalty than in the age of\r\nFrederick and Catherine, and, were not vaster issues at stake than\r\nthe improvement of human institutions, the same kind of regret might\r\nbe felt at the French Revolution which some have expressed for the\r\nReformation as a premature movement, destructive of safe and moderate\r\nreform.\r\n\r\nIn truth, however, the human spirit at both epochs needed\r\nregeneration; to have perpetuated the eighteenth-century type,\r\nadmirable as this is in many respects, would have denoted consent to\r\ndwell in decencies for ever. CESARE BECCARIA (1738-94) and GAETANO\r\nFILANGIERI (175-287) were nevertheless great reformers, who, the former\r\nin his _Dei Delitti delle Pene_ (1763), the latter in his _Scienza\r\ndella Legislazione_ (1783), contributed greatly to overthrow mediæval\r\nnotions of justice, and to infuse a humane spirit into legislation,\r\nnot merely by the abolition of revolting and atrocious penalties,\r\nbut by proposing the reformation of the criminal as a chief object\r\nof the lawgiver. This was the especial mission of Beccaria, who\r\nalso introduced a very important principle by his clear separation\r\nof the legislative and the judicial functions. Filangieri combats\r\nin particular the excessive interference of governments, while he\r\nforeshadows the logic and simplicity of a universal code in the future,\r\nrealised in some measure by the Code Napoleon. ANTONIO GENOVESI\r\n(1712-69), the first to show the necessity of Italian unity, besides\r\nmaking important contributions to ethics and metaphysics, expounded\r\nfreedom of trade and the laws that govern prices, in his _Lezioni di\r\nCommercio, o sia d’Economia Civile_. Free trade in corn had also a\r\npowerful champion in the witty Abate FERDINANDO GALIANI (1728-87),\r\nwhose most important works, however, were written in French. Galiani\r\nadorned the circles of the encyclopædist philosophers at Paris, whose\r\nviews on many points he soundly refuted, and who avenged themselves by\r\ncomparing the explosive little Neapolitan to a pantomime incarnate. His\r\ndiscourse upon trade in corn was speedily translated into Italian, and\r\ngave him rank as an Italian classic; the best known of his vernacular\r\nwritings is probably his humorous account of the alarm created by an\r\neruption of Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nAfter this group of economists--to whom the historian PIETRO VERRI may\r\nbe added--should be recorded another of literary historians, eminently\r\nuseful though not brilliant writers, and consummate men of letters. Of\r\nGIOVANNI MARIO CRESCIMBENI, the historian of Italian poetry, we shall\r\nhave to speak in mentioning the Arcadian Academy, which he so largely\r\ncontributed to found and maintain. He may be justly termed a pedant,\r\nbut neither his book nor himself can be spared from Italian literary\r\nhistory. A much greater name is LODOVICO ANTONIO MURATORI (1672-1745),\r\nbut his imperishable monument was raised not as author but as editor.\r\nThe publication of twenty-seven folio volumes of mediæval Italian\r\nhistorians displays a man singly equal to many learned societies. No\r\none has stamped his name more deeply on the historical literature of\r\nhis country than he has done by this publication, by his _Antiquitates\r\nItalicæ Medii Ævi_, and by his _Annali_ from the Christian era to\r\n1749. One of his original writings has an abiding place in literature,\r\nthe _Della perfetta Poesia_, which indicates the high-water mark of\r\ngood taste at the time of its publication. The affected style of the\r\npreceding century was then entirely out of fashion. On the negative\r\nside Muratori’s taste is almost faultless, and he often manifests great\r\ndiscrimination in the appreciation of exquisite beauties. Unfortunately\r\nhe is all for the delicate and graceful, and has little feeling for the\r\nreally great, of which the Italy of the eighteenth century saw hardly\r\nso much as the counterfeit until, late in the secular period, Cesarotti\r\nproduced his version of Ossian. Muratori venerates Dante rather than\r\nadmires him; like Confucius, he respects the gods, but keeps them at a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThe learning and industry of Muratori were almost rivalled by\r\nCount SCIPIONE MAFFEI (1675-1755), the sovereign of contemporary\r\nItalian, almost of European archæologists, author of the famous\r\ntragedy of _Merope_ and of the equally famed _Verona Illustrata_;\r\nand by Count Giovanni Maria Mazzuchelli (1707-65), who should have\r\nbeen the biographer-general of Italian men of letters, but who began\r\nhis work on too large a scale for completion. GIROLAMO TIRABOSCHI\r\n(1731-94), librarian of the Duke of Modena, is the standard Italian\r\nliterary historian. His great work has immortalised his name; it will\r\nnevertheless disappoint those who resort to it in the expectation\r\nof encountering a history on the modern plan. It is not, strictly\r\nspeaking, so much a history of literature as a history of learning.\r\nThe fortunes of schools and universities, the rise and decay of\r\nparticular branches of study, are narrated very fully, while there is\r\nlittle literary criticism, and the lives of great men are recounted\r\nwith astonishing brevity, except when some personal or intellectual\r\ncircumstance regarding them has become the theme of erudite\r\ncontroversy, when the incident overshadows the life. One of the most\r\npotent literary influences of the age was the _Giornale de’ Letterati_,\r\nfounded early in the century by Apostolo Zeno, which long served as a\r\nrallying-point for Italian literary men.\r\n\r\nThe number of historical works published in Italy during the\r\neighteenth century was considerable, but they are chiefly monographs on\r\nlocal history, and, unless Verri’s history of Lombardy be an exception,\r\nnone gained the author the character of a philosophical historian save\r\nCARLO DENINA’S _Rivoluzioni d’Italia_ (1768-72), a work so superior\r\nto the writer’s other performances that it has been doubted whether\r\nhe really wrote it. A valuable history of another description was\r\nproduced by the ex-Jesuit LUIGI LANZI (1732-1811), also celebrated\r\nas an Etruscan scholar, in his _Storia Pittorica dell’ Italia_, long\r\nago superseded by more accurate research, but excellent for the\r\ntime. Art criticism was promoted by FRANCESCO ALGAROTTI (1712-1764),\r\nchamberlain and friend of Frederick the Great, Carlyle’s “young\r\nVenetian gentleman of elegance in dusky skin and very while linen,” a\r\nmost voluminous writer, “who,” says the unmusical Carlyle, “took up\r\nthe opera in earnest manner as capable of being a school of virtue\r\nand the moral sublime,” but whose chief title to fame is rather his\r\npopular exposition of the physics of Newton, a modest but meritorious\r\nservice. Two miscellaneous writers deserve considerable attention. One\r\nis GIUSEPPE BARETTI (1719-86), “a wonderful, wild, coarse, tender,\r\nangry creature,” says Vernon Lee; endeared to Englishmen as the friend\r\nof Johnson and of Reynolds, and the imitator of the _Spectator_ in his\r\n_Frusta Litteraria_, although an Ishmael whose hand was against every\r\ncontemporary, and who carried personality to lengths which Addison\r\nwould have highly disapproved. The most entertaining of his writings\r\nare his lively letters from Spain and Portugal. The other is GASPARE\r\nGOZZI (1715-86), brother of the famous dramatist, who also imitated\r\nthe _Spectator_ in a periodical, wrote excellent stories in prose and\r\nverse, and rendered a durable service to literature by his defence of\r\nDante against the aspersions of Bettinelli, preluding the Dantesque\r\nrevival of the next century.\r\n\r\nContemporaneously with this development of moral and economical\r\nscience, another active movement went on which created far more\r\nagitation among Italian literati, and which, if it scarcely enriched\r\nthe national literature with a single work of merit, at all events kept\r\nup the tradition of poetry. This was the universal itch for rhyming\r\nwhich seized upon the nation about the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, and dates from the foundation of the Arcadian Academy in\r\n1692. This epoch-making event is related with unsurpassable verve in\r\nthe brilliant pages of Vernon Lee, who rekindles for us the chief\r\nlights of the institution and the time: the frigid and sardonic, but\r\nreally illustrious jurist Gravina, instructor of Montesquieu and of the\r\nAcademy; the uncouth pedant but excellent administrator Crescimbeni,\r\nwhose history of Italian poetry is a more valuable book than Vernon Lee\r\nallows; the fluent versifiers, not without gleams of a genuine poetical\r\nvein, Rolli and Frugoni; the marvellous improvisatore Perfetti, a\r\nsounding brass, but no tinkling cymbal, who actually received in the\r\nCapitol the crown awarded to Petrarch and designed for Tasso.\r\n\r\nThe seriousness with which these Alfesibeo Carios and Opico Erimanteos\r\ntook themselves, their crooks and their wigs, is astonishing. But they\r\ngot accepted at their own valuation, and none disputed their claims\r\nas the sovereign arbiters of elegant literature until, about 1760,\r\nGiuseppe Baretti arose to demonstrate that, as shepherds, they must be\r\nthe representatives of the ancient Scythians. Settembrini in our own\r\nday rather opines that they were created by the Jesuits, just as the\r\nCobbett of the _Rejected Addresses_ denounces “the gewgaw fetters of\r\nrhyme, invented by the monks in the Middle Ages to enslave the people.”\r\nEvery city in Italy had its offshoot of the Arcadia; every member did\r\nsomething to approve his literary taste, were it but one of the hundred\r\nand fifty elegies, in all manner of languages, on the decease of Signor\r\nBalestrieri’s cat (1741). The result was a deluge of insipid verse,\r\npreferable at any rate to the extravagance of the preceding century.\r\n\r\nTwo Arcadians alone evinced real poetical talent, the two Zappis\r\nof Imola. FELICE ZAPPI wrought on a small scale, but with exquisite\r\nperfection. His sonnets, madrigals, and lyrical trifles generally are\r\namong the very choicest examples of Italian minor poetry for elegance,\r\n_esprit_, and melody. It is true that he exposed himself to the\r\nmerciless ridicule of Baretti by dreaming that he stood upon his hind\r\nlegs and barked madrigals in the character of his lady’s lap-dog, but\r\nthis lapse ought not to count against his genuine merits. His wife,\r\nFaustina, formerly Maratti, is more ambitious but less consummate.\r\nHer writings are nevertheless always estimable, and one sonnet is\r\nremarkable for an energy and vehemence sped straight from the heart:\r\n\r\n      _Lady, on whom my Lord was wont to gaze\r\n        Complacent so, that oft unto mine ear\r\n        Of thy abundant tress and aspect clear\r\n      And silvery speech he yet resounds the praise;\r\n      Tell me, when thou to him discourse didst raise,\r\n        Seemed he, immersed in musing, not to hear?\r\n        Or, as to me may chance, did look austere,\r\n      And moody frown his countenance deface?\r\n      Time was, I know, when passionate and weak\r\n        Thy fair eyes found him, and I know that, till--\r\n        But ah! what blushes mantle on thy cheek!\r\n      Thy glance declines to earth, thy eyelids thrill!\r\n        Answer, I pray thee--no! hush! never speak\r\n        If thou wouldst tell me that he loves thee still!_\r\n\r\nAll the minor Italian versifiers were speedily eclipsed by the genius\r\nof Metastasio, whose place, however, is with dramatic poets. But for\r\nhim, the eighteenth century wore away without producing a poet of\r\ngreat mark, until, in 1763, Italy was startled by the appearance of\r\nthe _Mattina_, the first part of the _Giorno_ of GIUSEPPE PARINI.\r\nParini is particularly interesting as the first eminent Italian poet\r\nwho shows decided traces of English influence. The plan of his poem is\r\ntaken from Thomson, the spirit is the spirit of Pope; the net result is\r\nmuch such a poem as Cowper might have written had he been an Italian.\r\nJust as Thomson in his _Seasons_ depicts the entire course of Nature\r\nfrom four points of view, so Parini in his _Giorno_ delineates the\r\nuseless life of a frivolous young Italian of quality by exhibiting the\r\noccupations of his morning, afternoon, evening, and night. The spirit\r\nis that of Pope’s satires, but Parini, composing in blank verse, has\r\nbeen led into a style more nearly resembling that of Young, although\r\nhe has little of the sententious abruptness of the _Night Thoughts_ or\r\nof their fatiguing glitter: the four poems are perfect wholes, gliding\r\nfrom theme to theme by the most ingenious and delicate transitions, and\r\nreplete with charming episodes; the diction is exquisite, and the blank\r\nverse the best that Italy had then seen. The work is invaluable as a\r\npicture of manners, and a masterpiece of delicate polished satire; the\r\n_jeunesse dorée_ of Milan is or ought to be made thoroughly ashamed of\r\nthe vapidity of its existence, but every phrase is urbane, and all the\r\nridicule dainty and ironical. The subject is hardly susceptible of high\r\npoetry, but Parini has adorned it as only a poet could. The composition\r\nof the remaining three parts occupied him for many years, and the\r\nlast two are not quite complete. His minor pieces reveal the same\r\nremarkable power as the _Giorno_ of elevating trifling circumstances\r\ninto the region of poetry. One sonnet especially is worthy of the Greek\r\nAnthology in finish and charm of invention:\r\n\r\n      _Benignant Sleep, that on soft pinion sped\r\n        Dost wing through darkling night thy noiseless way,\r\n        And fleeting multitudes of dreams display\r\n      To weariness reposed on quiet bed:\r\n      Go where my Phillis doth her gentle head\r\n        And blooming cheek on peaceful pillow lay,\r\n        And while the body sleeps, the soul affray\r\n      With dismal shape from thy enchantment bred.\r\n      So like unto mine own that form be made,\r\n        Pallor so dim disfiguring its face,\r\n        That she may waken by compassion swayed.\r\n      If this thou wilt accomplish of thy grace,\r\n        A double wreath of poppies I will braid,\r\n        And silently upon thine altar place._\r\n\r\nParini, “a poor sickly priest,” led an uneventful life in Milan\r\nuntil the overthrow of Austrian rule by the French invasion, when he\r\ncame forward prominently in public affairs, and earned credit by his\r\ngood sense and moderation. He died in 1799, aged seventy. He was a\r\nhigh-minded man of austere morality.\r\n\r\nAnother poet of the eighteenth century deserves no less fame than\r\nParini, but has remained comparatively unknown from having written\r\nin dialect. It is his compensation to be as decidedly at the head\r\nof the Sicilian lyrists as Petrarch is at the head of the Tuscan;\r\nnor is Sicilian in any degree a rude or barbarous idiom. Schools of\r\nSicilian poetry existed in the thirteenth, and again in the sixteenth\r\nand seventeenth centuries, but all previous celebrities were eclipsed\r\nby the brilliant achievements of GIOVANNI MELI (1740-1815). Meli can\r\nhardly be paralleled either with Burns or with our English Theocritus,\r\nWilliam Barnes, for he possesses neither Burns’s tragic pathos and\r\nwithering satire, nor Barnes’s power of realistic description. But he\r\nrivals Burns in simplicity and melody, and is capable of much loftier\r\nlyric flights than Barnes; and if his satire does not brand or scathe,\r\nit smiles and sparkles with genial humour. The lightness, ease, and\r\ngrace of his songs cannot be exceeded; his pastorals are worthy of a\r\ncountryman of Theocritus; and his mock-heroics, _Don Quixote_, and the\r\n_Origin of the World_, though evincing less of poetical inspiration,\r\nare effluences of genuine humour. His employment of the Sicilian\r\ndialect was highly favourable to his genius by exempting him from all\r\nobligation to write with academical constraint. It is most interesting\r\nto find Wordsworth’s plea for a return to nature anticipated by a\r\nSicilian of the generally stiff and affected eighteenth century.\r\nOne of the most marked features of his poetry is its lively and\r\ndramatic character, arising from the close observation of national\r\ntypes, apparently just as they were observed by the ancient writers\r\nof Sicilian mimes, Sophron and Epicharmus. “As in antiquity,” says\r\nPaul Heyse, “so at this day, idyll, song, and mime are the species\r\nof poetical composition allotted as the Sicilian heritage.” Meli\r\nrepresented the national genius to perfection. His life was uneventful.\r\nHe is represented as an amiable, sensible, unassuming man, as much\r\nof a Bacchus as consistent with sobriety, and as much of an Anacreon\r\nas comported with an utter ignorance of Greek, an _abate_ of the old\r\nschool, attached, but not in a perverse or bigoted manner, to the\r\nancient social order, which, by the aid of British ships and troops,\r\nmaintained itself better in Sicily than elsewhere in Italy.\r\n\r\nThe licentious poems of the Abate GIOVANNI BATTISTA CASTI (1721-1803)\r\ndeserve attention from their influence on Byron’s _Don Juan_, and\r\nalso from the veiled political character of many of them. Casti, an\r\naccomplished traveller and acquainted with many distinguished men,\r\nbelongs, like Talleyrand, both to the old time and to the new. Attached\r\nby habit and taste to the polished and frivolous society of the\r\nancient régime, his sympathies were nevertheless liberal. He satirised\r\nCatherine the Second, and when exiled from Vienna on that account, had\r\nthe spirit to resign his Austrian pension. The _Animali Parlanti_ a\r\nsatire upon the rule of the stronger in political life, and thus an\r\ninteresting revival of the old conception of Reynard the Fox, is his\r\nbest work.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the age of Richardson and Fielding in England,\r\nand Marivaux and Prevost d’Exiles in France, should have produced no\r\nnovelist of reputation in Italy. The imitation of even such world-famed\r\nbooks as the _Nouvelle Héloise_ and _Werther_ was reserved for a later\r\ngeneration. One romancer acquired some celebrity--Count ALESSANDRO\r\nVERRI (1741-1816), who hit upon, or borrowed from Wieland, the idea of\r\nresorting for his themes to antiquity. His _Notti Romane_, _Saffo_, and\r\n_Erostrato_ are all works of merit, and the first-named was probably\r\nnot without influence upon Landor.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the history of the Italy of the eighteenth century is\r\nin most departments, intellectual and political, that of a patient\r\nrecovering from a formidable malady by slow but certain stages. Much\r\nis lost, never to return. The relation of Italy to the rest of Europe\r\nis no longer that of Athens to Sparta or Bœotia, as in the sixteenth\r\ncentury; but neither, as in the seventeenth, is she estranged from\r\nthe general current of European thought. Her intellectual position\r\nmay be read in the very portraits of her eminent men, who in general\r\ndisplay the placid eighteenth-century type, and might as well have been\r\nFrenchmen or Englishmen as Italians. They were writers of signal merit\r\nand utility, but, Vico excepted, not men of creative genius, and the\r\nnational mind might easily have degenerated into mediocrity but for\r\nthe tremendous convulsions of the end of the century. In one province,\r\nhowever, she stood apart and supreme during nearly the whole of the\r\nage--the drama, with or without musical accompaniment, which must form\r\nthe subject of our next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII\r\n    THE COMEDY OF MASKS--THE OPERA--DRAMA OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century, if chiefly remarkable in Italian literary\r\nhistory for the dawn of national regeneration, and the assimilation\r\nof literature to the type prevailing in other European countries, is\r\nalso memorable as the period when Italian dramatists first acquired a\r\nEuropean renown. This recognition may be considered to date from the\r\nproduction of Count Maffei’s _Merope_ in 1714, and from the summons\r\nof Apostolo Zeno to Vienna a few years afterwards. These two men\r\nrepresented, one, the classical tragedy, which, notwithstanding its\r\nconventional acceptance, has ever remained an exotic in Italy; the\r\nother, that special creation of Italian genius, the musical play or\r\nopera. Later in the century, Alfieri and Metastasio carried both forms\r\nnearer to perfection, and Goldoni gave his country a comedy at once\r\nbrilliant and regular. Yet the genuine dramatic life of the nation is\r\nto be found in the _commedia dell’ arte_, or Comedy of Masks, contemned\r\nby the learned, but dear to the people, which, except for a brief\r\ninterval in the hands of Carlo Gozzi, failed to clothe itself with\r\nliterary form, but has pervaded the theatres of Europe in the costume\r\nof harlequin, columbine, and pantaloon.\r\n\r\nAs the simplest, the _commedia dell’ arte_ is probably the oldest\r\nform of the drama. There can be no question that the Greek rustics who\r\nsmeared their faces with wine-lees at the Dionysiac festivals, and\r\nfrom whose improvised songs and gestures Greek comedy was developed,\r\nvirtually enacted the same parts as the Tuscan and Neapolitan peasants,\r\nwho, inheriting this rude entertainment from Roman times, preserved\r\nit through the Middle Ages, until it assumed new importance in the\r\ngeneral awakening of the sixteenth century. The original wine-lees\r\ngave place to masks, and as masks cannot be varied _ad infinitum_, the\r\ncharacters became limited to a few well-defined and salient types.\r\nHence every piece had substantially the same personages; although the\r\nItalian comedy allows of numerous variations upon its four stock parts.\r\nThis caused the dialogue to be mainly extemporaneous; and as comedy is\r\nmore easily extemporised than tragedy, the pieces tended more and more\r\ntowards farce. At the same time, “the fertility of fancy, quickness\r\nof intelligence, facility of utterance, command of language, and\r\npresence of mind,” indispensable to a good impromptu comedian, bestowed\r\na certain regularity upon the performance. The actor was obliged\r\nto observe the conditions imposed by the character he represented,\r\nconventional as this was: if he enacted Pantaloon, he must not comport\r\nhimself as Brighella or the Doctor, and _vice versâ_. As in the Indian\r\ndrama, the comic passages were usually in dialect; the serious, if any,\r\nin cultivated language. Despised as literature, these pieces attained\r\ngreat popularity even beyond the limits of Italy, especially in Paris,\r\nwhere they divided public favour with the national theatre for a\r\nhundred and fifty years. As, however, they were mainly improvised, and\r\nno care was taken of such parts as might chance to be written down,\r\nthey have virtually perished. No literary relic of their palmy days\r\nseems to exist except the _scenarios_ or skeleton plans of some of\r\nthem, mere outlines to be filled up by the performers. Modern readers\r\nwill hardly obtain a better idea of their spirit than from Vernon\r\nLee’s inimitable _Prince of the Hundred Soups_, a fantastic tale laid\r\nin the seventeenth century, the culminating period of these dramatic\r\nimpromptus, towards the close of which they began to yield to the\r\nmusical drama. Their capability of real dramatic excellence is revealed\r\nby two more recent developments--the improved Pulcinello farces of\r\nFRANCESCO CERLONE, a Neapolitan tailor, who, in the later half of the\r\neighteenth century, “lifted,” says Scherillo, “Pulcinello from the\r\ncrowd of masks, and made him the monarch of the popular theatre”; and\r\nthe fairy dramas of Carlo Gozzi, a Venetian of the same period. Both\r\nusually wrote their plays out, or at least left comparatively little\r\nto the invention of the actors; but Cerlone composed entirely in the\r\nspirit of the _commedia dell’ arte_. His Pulcinello is commonly a butt,\r\ndesigned to keep the audience throughout in a roar of laughter by his\r\nridiculous adventures, an object most fully attained. Gozzi’s pieces\r\nare of higher literary quality, and demand a more particular notice.\r\n\r\nCARLO GOZZI (1720-1808), brother of Gaspare Gozzi, already mentioned,\r\nwould merit an honourable place among Italian writers merely on the\r\nstrength of his entertaining memoirs, translated by Symonds. His real\r\nsignificance in literary history, however, is confined to the four\r\nbrilliant years in which he carried all before him on the Venetian\r\nstage by his _fiabe_ or dramatised fairy tales, composed in the spirit\r\nof the _commedia dell’ arte_, in so far that many of the characters\r\nbelonged to the old conventional types, and that a portion of the\r\naction was highly farcical. These characteristics were nevertheless\r\ncombined with a regular plot capable of exciting deep interest. The\r\n_fiabe_ originated in a literary quarrel. Goldoni, the restorer of true\r\ncomedy to Italy, had denounced the buffooneries of the old _commedia\r\ndell’ arte_, and Gozzi, who had himself cultivated that form, and whose\r\npartiality for it was enhanced by a misunderstanding with Goldoni,\r\ndetermined to show its capabilities, and at the same time to ridicule\r\nhis dramatic rivals, Goldoni and the Abate Chiari. To this end he\r\nhit upon the extremely happy idea of dramatising the fairy tales in\r\nBasile’s _Pentamerone_, thus creating a form represented in English\r\nliterature by the admirable burlesques of Planché, but with even more\r\nresemblance to an ancient form of which no complete example remains,\r\nthe mythological parodies of the Attic Middle Comedy, which combined\r\nridicule of the tragic poets with a regular plot derived from ancient\r\ntradition.\r\n\r\nIn the _scenario_ of his _Three Oranges_, a play not preserved in\r\nits entirety, Gozzi has explained how he burlesqued his rivals, as,\r\nfor instance, when the long journeys which Chiari’s personages are\r\nsupposed to perform within the compass of a single action are ridiculed\r\nby Tartaglia and Truffaldino being propelled two thousand leagues by\r\nthe devil with a pair of bellows. (“They sprawled on the grass at the\r\nsudden cessation of the favouring gale.”) The success of the _Three\r\nOranges_ was immense, and contributed to drive Goldoni from Venice. It\r\nwas followed by a rapid succession of similar pieces, tending, however,\r\nto assume more of a literary character, and become more and more remote\r\nfrom the original type of the Comedy of Masks. This, if diminishing\r\ntheir value as illustrations of popular manners and sentiment, renders\r\nthem more generally enjoyable; and they would have a wide European\r\nreputation were they not principally composed in the Venetian dialect.\r\n_Turandot_, in the translation, or rather imitation, of Schiller, is\r\nknown wherever German literature extends; but the scarcely inferior\r\nmerits of the _Blue Monster_, the _Green Bird_, and the like, have not\r\nin general induced foreigners to learn the Venetian patois.\r\n\r\nGozzi, in truth, just missed greatness; he had the artistic talent\r\nto work out a clever idea, but not the poetical fancy requisite to\r\nelevate this lo a region of ideal beauty. As suggested by Symonds, his\r\npieces would supply excellent material for operatic libretti. Tieck\r\nsubsequently undertook the task with higher qualifications, but the\r\nfavourable moment had gone by. Gozzi’s plays are the true offspring of\r\nthe national spirit, Tieck’s merely importations. After four years of\r\nbrilliant triumphs, Gozzi slopped short, fearing to fatigue the public\r\ntaste, or conscious of having exhausted his vein. The remainder of his\r\ncareer as a dramatic author was chiefly occupied with adaptations from\r\nthe Spanish.\r\n\r\nWhile in the later seventeenth and early eighteenth century the Comedy\r\nof Masks was decaying, a new form of drama was silently growing up,\r\nthe operatic, “a thing,” says Vernon Lee, “born of scenic displays\r\nand concerts, moulded into a romantic, wholly original shape, by the\r\nrequirements of scenery, music, and singing.” Its character as a\r\nliterary production is indicated by the fact that its proper title\r\nof _melodrama_ has become synonymous with something quite different,\r\nthe prose tragedy which aims at strong sensational situations, while\r\n_melodramatic_ evokes no association with music.\r\n\r\nThe chief representatives of new literary forms are frequently heralded\r\nby precursors, who, if serving in some sense as foils to their genius,\r\nyet deprive them of the praise of absolute originality. What Phrynichus\r\nwas to Æschylus, and Marlowe to Shakespeare, APOSTOLO ZENO (1668-1750),\r\na Venetian of Candiote extraction, was to PIETRO METASTASIO. It was\r\nnot Metastasio but Zeno who gave the musical drama literary rank, and\r\nproved that poets as well as musicians might make their reputations\r\nand their fortunes by it. Zeno produced his first serious attempt in\r\nmusical drama in 1695, and long held the position of chief dramatic\r\npoet of Italy. After founding and for many years conducting the\r\ninfluential _Giornale de’ Letterati_, he became court poet at Vienna\r\nin 1718, and eleven years afterwards retired voluntarily in favour of\r\nthe rising Metastasio, who completely eclipsed him on the stage, but\r\ncould not deprive him of the honour of having first taught Italy how\r\ndramatic poetry of a high order might be associated with music. Zeno,\r\nmoreover, was no mere playwright, but a good lyrical poet with a strong\r\ndramatic instinct, a scholar, moreover, and antiquary, and a renowned\r\ncollector of medals. His last years were spent in honour and comfort at\r\nhis native Venice. Ere his life terminated in 1750 the productiveness\r\nof his successor had almost come to an end.\r\n\r\nMetastasio’s long prosperous life was not destitute of romance. The\r\nson (born 1698) of a petty Neapolitan druggist settled at Rome, he was\r\nadopted by the famous jurist and excellent dramatic critic Gravina,\r\nwho had heard him singing in the street, for although at the time an\r\ninglorious, he was fortunately not a mute Milton. Victor Cousin was\r\nsimilarly snatched from the gutter, for different issues and from\r\ndifferent motives. His sonorous appellative was the gift of his patron,\r\nwho Hellenised his protégé’s original name of Trapassi, and left him\r\na fortune. After wasting most of his benefactor’s legacy, Metastasio\r\narticled himself to a Neapolitan lawyer named Castagnola, who received\r\nhim on condition that he should not even read, much less write, a line\r\nof verse. This pledge was broken by the composition in 1722 of the\r\n_Gardens of the Hesperides_, a little mask composed under compulsion\r\nfrom the Austrian viceroy. The secret of the authorship was ferreted\r\nout by La Romanina, the celebrated _cantatrice_, who pounced upon\r\nMetastasio, bore him from Castagnola’s house to her own, and made him a\r\ndramatic poet. She was a married woman much older than Metastasio, and\r\nthere seems no suggestion that her affection was other than maternal.\r\nIt ended, however, unhappily, perhaps tragically.\r\n\r\nThe immense success of his _Didone Abbandonata_, performed at Rome in\r\n1723, and followed by a number of similar pieces, had made Metastasio\r\nthe undisputed sovereign of the lyric stage, and in 1730 he was invited\r\nto Vienna to replace the veteran Zeno. He went. La Romanina wished to\r\nfollow, but never did, and died very suddenly in 1734. Had Metastasio,\r\nnow devoted to Countess Althan, to whom he is said to have been\r\nprivately married, obstructed her journey? and was her death natural?\r\nThere is nothing but surmise as to the precise nature of the case; but\r\nVernon Lee’s tragical summing-up is true as a statement of fact: “Thus\r\nended the romance of Metastasio’s life, and with it his youth, and soon\r\nafter his hope and his genius.” His Vienna period between 1730 and 1740\r\nwas artistically the most brilliant of his life, but he wrote little\r\nafterwards; though his dramas long monopolised the Italian lyric stage;\r\nand the decline of his productive power seems to have been chiefly\r\nowing to the untoward interruption to dramatic performances occasioned\r\nby the Austrian war of succession in 1740 and following years. When\r\npeace returned, Metastasio had become nervous and hypochondriacal; he\r\nyet gained his culminating triumph with the _Atilio Regolo_ in 1750,\r\nand the later half of his life, which ended in 1782, was embellished by\r\nhis friendship with the Italian singer-statesman, Farinelli. Metastasio\r\nwas selfish, but not cold-hearted; he pined for affection, but shrank\r\nfrom self-sacrifice; and his self-regarding instinct was not ennobled\r\nby devotion to any of the causes or pursuits which inspired Goethe. Yet\r\nhe was a connoisseur in virtue, and his dramas represent her in some of\r\nher most attractive shapes. He saw forty editions of his works in his\r\nown library; he had not only accumulated but had refused distinctions;\r\nif he could feel free from blame towards La Romanina, there was nothing\r\nwith which he needed to reproach himself. His life had been a continual\r\ntriumph; no wonder if he had become weary of it at last.\r\n\r\nOperatic success requires two endowments rarely united in the same\r\nperson, the ingenuity of a playwright and the melody of a nightingale.\r\nBoth these are combined in Metastasio; he is a very Scribe for\r\nbriskness, deftness, and clever contrivance of plot; ere he had become\r\nnervous and depressed, his Neapolitan brain seethed at a dramatic\r\nsituation; his _Achille in Sciro_, one of the best of his pieces, was\r\nwritten, provided with music and scenery, and thoroughly organised\r\nfor representation, within eighteen days. Other Italian librettists\r\nmay have rivalled him in tunefulness or in the faculty of dramatic\r\nconstruction, none in both these respects, and none have been able\r\nto impart the like literary quality to their compositions; partly\r\nbecause he possessed and they lacked the indescribable something that\r\nmakes the poet; partly because the sentiment which with them is merely\r\ntheatrical, is with him sincere.\r\n\r\nThe general inferiority of operatic libretti has occasioned the\r\nmusical drama to be despised as a branch of literature; although,\r\nto say nothing of the recent achievements of Richard Wagner, the\r\nEuripidean play, with its frequent predominance of solos over choral\r\nparts, approximated to the modern opera. It is no doubt true that the\r\nfirst requisite is that the words should be a vehicle for the music,\r\nand that, supposing this object attained, it is feasible to dispense\r\nwith poetry. It follows that poetry usually is dispensed with, and\r\nthat the only literary gift deemed absolutely indispensable for opera\r\nis that of dramatic construction. It is the great distinction of\r\nMetastasio to have been at the same time a consummate playwright and\r\na true lyrical poet. Other great playwrights have been great poets\r\nin blank verse; but, at any rate for the first half of his life,\r\nMetastasio’s bosom was as affluent a storehouse of melody as Rückert’s;\r\nto sing was for him as easy as to speak. He was constrained to submit\r\nhimself to the laws of the opera, inexorable because founded upon the\r\nreason of things. As an opera can be nothing without a _cantatrice_,\r\nit follows that it must turn chiefly upon the passion of love; as\r\nthe principal performers’ throats will not bear a perpetual strain,\r\nthey must necessarily be sometimes relieved by inferior executants;\r\nhence the necessity of an underplot, and of constructive ability to\r\ninterweave this with the main action. As the musical drama is not,\r\nafter all, natural, the audience’s attention must be kept occupied\r\nby continual action and bustle; as the singer must leave the stage\r\nat his best, the recitative must be followed by an air. Such tags\r\nmust be judged simply with reference to the musical effect, which\r\nwith Metastasio was always very great. On the whole, few writers have\r\nadapted means to ends more successfully than he has done, or have more\r\ncompletely solved the problem of investing the amusement of the moment\r\nwith abiding literary worth.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated of Metastasio’s lyrical dramas are perhaps the\r\n_Olimpiade_, the _Achille in Sciro_, the _Clemenza di Tito_, and the\r\n_Atilio Regolo_. The _Artaserse_, the _Temistocle_, the _Zenobia_,\r\nhave also a high reputation, and in truth the intervals of merit among\r\nhis pieces are not very wide. The operatic dramatist is released from\r\nmany of the obligations which press most heavily upon the tragic\r\nor comic poet; he is at liberty to mingle the manners and ideas of\r\ndifferent ages and nations as much as he pleases; no great profundity\r\nof psychological analysis can be expected from him, for if he possessed\r\nthis gift the conditions of his field of art would debar him from\r\nmanifesting it. It is enough if his subject is interesting, his action\r\nlively and well combined, and his melody copious and spontaneous.\r\nMetastasio selected his themes with consummate judgment, and showed a\r\nScribe-like power of devising bustling action and sudden surprises,\r\nwhile his tunefulness is remarkable even for an Italian poet. His\r\npieces would have enthralled audiences even without literary charm.\r\nThat they retain their place in the library after their disappearance\r\nfrom the stage proves him a poet as well as a dramatist. His oratorios\r\nresemble his secular pieces, but are less interesting. His cantatas\r\nhave the air of loppings from his dramas. The chief merit of his other\r\nlyrical compositions is their inexhaustible melody.\r\n\r\nThe vogue of the lyrical drama under Zeno and Metastasio was not\r\nfavourable to the more legitimate forms of the art. “_Ce beau\r\nmonstre_,” said Voltaire, “_étouffe Melpomène_.” If so, the Italian\r\ndrama was stifled, like Desdemona, in her sleep. The extravagance of\r\nthe first half of the seventeenth century had been succeeded by the\r\ntorpor of the second, and nothing really good had been produced in\r\neither. It was not until 1713 that a tragedy appeared which deserved\r\nand obtained a European reputation. This was the _Merope_ of Count\r\nScipione Maffei, whose principal work, his _Verona Illustrata_,\r\nhas already been mentioned, and who, besides many other claims to\r\ndistinction, gained an honourable fame as a natural philosopher, as\r\nthe critical historian of chivalric orders, and as the denouncer of\r\nduelling. A man of this stamp, however gifted, was not likely to be\r\nrichly endowed with the poetical temperament, and Maffei’s _Merope_\r\nshares the almost universal fault of modern tragedies on classical\r\nsubjects, it is essentially a work of reflection. It was composed\r\nwith the deliberate purpose of retrieving the Italian drama from its\r\ndegraded condition, and was the result of conversations wilh the\r\nactor Riccoboni, author of an esteemed work on the Italian stage, who\r\nlamented that the theatre of his own country afforded him no fine\r\nparts. The want was well supplied by _Merope_, the plot being highly\r\ndramatic, and the treatment, in the opinion of Matthew Arnold, more\r\npoetical than that of either of Maffei’s successors, Voltaire and\r\nAlfieri.\r\n\r\nMaffei nevertheless was to yield to one of the most extraordinary men\r\nthat Italy ever produced, one brought up under so many disadvantages\r\nthat it might seem impossible that he should occupy a high place in\r\nthe literature of his country, and who nevertheless, by the mere force\r\nof will and character, has fought his way to almost the highest in\r\nhis own field. It must be added that although Count VITTORIO ALFIERI\r\n(1749-1803) might probably have been eminent as an historian or a\r\npolitical writer, tragedy and satire were the only departments of\r\npoetry in which it seems possible that he should have excelled. This\r\nis as much as to say that he was by nature little of a poet. He was\r\nalso little of an Italian, being by birth a Piedmontese, a people\r\nwhom the Italians of that day regarded, from an ethnographical point\r\nof view, much as the Greeks of Philip’s day regarded the Macedonians,\r\nand who were in truth destined to work out the parallel by subduing\r\nthe rest of the peninsula, though with very different aims and to very\r\ndifferent results. Alfieri was indeed more like an Englishman than an\r\nItalian, and might well have sat as a model to some delineator of the\r\nhaughty, eccentric, whimsical, misanthropic, hopelessly perverse, but\r\non occasion extravagantly generous being who is still accepted on the\r\nContinent as the embodiment of British national character. He did,\r\nin fact, belong to a type more common in England than elsewhere, the\r\npatrician republican of the mould of Algernon Sidney or Savage Landor,\r\nanimated by an unaffected passion for liberty, and yet arrogant,\r\nexacting, domineering; fired by a disinterested love of man, and always\r\nquarrelling with men.\r\n\r\nAlfieri fortunately felt moved to write his _Autobiography_, a\r\nwork of intense interest, and perhaps the most thoroughly sincere\r\namong celebrated books of its order of literature. It depicts a man\r\ncontinually under the influence of pride and discontent, but whom pride\r\nand discontent stimulate to lofty endeavour and noble actions. Vivid\r\nindeed is the picture of his self-contempt for his wasted youth and his\r\nignorance of his own language, the speech of Piedmont being then the\r\nworst of all provincial jargons. Most interesting is the detail of his\r\nself-education, both in purity of diction and in the dramatic art. This\r\npsychological interest is relieved and enhanced by the detail of his\r\nnumerous adventures, his extensive travels, and his love affairs, three\r\nof which were memorable. In London, in 1772, he fought, by the last\r\nrays of the setting sun, unattended by seconds, a duel with the injured\r\nhusband of Lady Ligonier, and wounded in the right arm, was immediately\r\nafterwards back in the theatre out of which he had been summoned to\r\nthe fray. His Milan adventure, if less romantic, was more whimsical:\r\nconvinced of the unworthiness of his siren, he imitated Ulysses by\r\ncompelling his servant to bind him to his chair until the craving for\r\nher company had passed away.\r\n\r\nAlfieri’s third escapade of the kind is world-famous, his rescue\r\nof Louise von Stolberg, Countess of Albany, from the drunken husband\r\nwho habitually maltreated her, and who, one blushes to record, was\r\nno other than Charles Edward Stuart, the chivalrous and adventurous\r\nYoung Pretender of a former generation. Alfieri’s attachment to the\r\nCountess was undoubtedly deep and permanent, and although she seems\r\nto have forgotten him after his death, she felt for him when he was\r\nthe only resource she had in the world. The intimacy might long have\r\nremained Platonic but for the extreme brutality of Charles Edward,\r\nwhich compelled the Countess to escape by Alfieri’s contrivance to\r\na convent where she saw neither her husband nor her lover. After a\r\nwhile the Cardinal of York, the Pretender’s brother, offered her an\r\nasylum in a Roman palace, where her acquaintance with Alfieri became\r\nmore intimate. Afterwards, legally separated by the interposition of\r\nthe King of Sweden, she withdrew to Alsace, where Alfieri followed\r\nher. They eventually established themselves in Paris, and the death\r\nof Charles Edward made no change in their existence. Louise, though\r\napparently not a warm-hearted, was a highly intellectual woman;\r\nhalf French, half German, she possessed a range of knowledge and\r\naccomplishment which Alfieri could hardly have found in any Italian\r\nwoman at that date, and her sympathy, without doubt, contributed\r\ngreatly to the development of his genius. Driven from France by the\r\nstorms of the Revolution, which he had at first hailed with a warmth\r\nwhich he afterwards repented, Alfieri settled with his mistress at\r\nFlorence. There he wrote the _Misogallo_, a furious denunciation of\r\nFrance, and exhausted by hard study and an ascetic life, died in\r\nOctober 1803, as, with an unconscious touch of irony, he was compelling\r\nhimself to write comedies. There seems no ground for believing that he\r\nwas privately married to the Countess, who honoured him with a monument\r\nbeautifully sculptured by Canova. If, however, the mourning figure\r\nby the tomb represents the bereaved one, she has taken the lion’s\r\nshare, Alfieri appearing merely as a medallion head in profile. Room\r\nshould have been found for a bust at least, for whimsical, saturnine,\r\narrogant as he was, he possessed not only a head but a heart. Scornful\r\nof superstition, he was endowed with deep religious feeling, and the\r\ndefects of his harsh, angular character were at all events remote from\r\nthose national failings which had chiefly contributed to the ruin of\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable indeed that a Piedmontese, who had to teach himself\r\nclassical Italian with infinite labour, and whose character possessed\r\nfew distinctively national traits, should have been the reviver of\r\nthe national spirit in Italy. This Alfieri unquestionably was. He had\r\nwhat is so deplorably wanting among the gifted men of the golden age\r\nof Italian literature, a passion for freedom and a hatred of tyranny,\r\nwhich impart to his works, however remote in subject from modern times,\r\nthe air of indignant protests against the subjection and degradation of\r\nhis country. This feeling, as well as the haughty and self-sufficing\r\nindependence of his character, brings him very near to the stoical\r\nRomans of the age of Nero, whose literary productions he approaches\r\nby his declamatory eloquence, his defective feeling for nature, and\r\nthe generally studied and laboured character of his poetry. Had Seneca\r\npossessed the leading requisites of a tragic poet, he would have been\r\na kind of Roman Alfieri. Comparing Alfieri’s tragedy with the modern\r\nform of the art which owes most to Seneca, the French drama of the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, we are sensible of a great\r\nadvance; not that Alfieri is comparable as a poet or a stylist to\r\nCorneille or Racine, but that his dramatic economy is improved by the\r\nsuppression of much conventional machinery, and the subordination of\r\namorous gallantry to more dignified and serious emotion.\r\n\r\nThe strongest family likeness prevails among Alfieri’s tragedies.\r\n“He is,” says Arnold, “a noble-minded, deeply interesting man, but a\r\nmonotonous poet.” The quality of “narrow elevation” which Arnold finds\r\nin Alfieri is indeed most apparent throughout all his plays; but they\r\nare not, like so many productions of the classical school tame and\r\nfrigid from pedantic over-correctness, nor are they untrue to nature\r\nthrough servile adherence to tradition and convention. Their dignity\r\nand nobility of feeling inspire deep respect; the author is evidently\r\nakin to the heroes he depicts, and in their place would have been\r\ncapable of their actions. His genius did not lead him to the imitation\r\nof the Greeks; his plays are rather such as a Roman poet might have\r\nproduced if he could have more completely emancipated himself from\r\nGreek models. He aimed at nervous conciseness, and attained it. The\r\neloquence which he acquired by a Demosthenic severity of study may\r\nbe fitter for the forum than the stage, but rarely degenerates into\r\nmere rhetoric. His theme is always some grand action derived from\r\nhistory or mythology. His predilection is rather for the heroes of\r\nliberty, like Timoleon or the Brutuses. _Saul_, however, is probably\r\nhis most successful play upon the whole, though _Myrrha_ may produce\r\nthe greatest effect when an actress can be found competent for so\r\nexceptional a part. _Philip the Second_ inspired Schiller’s _Don\r\nCarlos_. _Antigone_, _Orestes_, and the _Conspiracy of the Pazzi_ may\r\nalso be named among Alfieri’s most successful pieces.\r\n\r\nAlfieri’s prose-writings possess no great value, except the\r\n_Autobiography_, which is invaluable alike from the interest of the\r\ncharacter depicted and of the events narrated, and from its transparent\r\ncandour. As a rule, the only quite trustworthy autobiographic\r\ndelineations are the unconscious ones. Pepys has undoubtedly portrayed\r\nhimself just as he was, but it is equally certain that he had no\r\nintention of doing so. Alfieri may or may not have depicted himself\r\nas he was, although the portrait is perfectly in harmony with the\r\nimpression derived from his writings. But he has unquestionably\r\ndepicted himself as he appeared to himself, and more could not be\r\nexpected. Alfieri’s minor poems display the “narrow elevation” ascribed\r\nby Matthew Arnold to his tragedies. He has little music, fancy, or\r\nvariety, but expresses strong feeling with unusual energy, especially\r\nwhen moved to wrath:\r\n\r\n      _Was Angelo born here? and he who wove\r\n        Love’s charm with sorcery of Tuscan tongue\r\n        Indissolubly blent? and he whose song\r\n      Laid bare the world below to world above?\r\n      And he who from his lowly valley clove\r\n        The azure height and trod the stars among?\r\n        And he whose searching mind the monarch’s wrong\r\n      Fount of the people’s misery did prove?\r\n      Yea, these had birth when men might uncontrolled\r\n        Speak, read, write, reason with impunity;\r\n        Not from the chair was cowardice extolled;\r\n      Not for free thinking would indictment lie;\r\n        Nor did the city in her Book of Gold\r\n        Inscribe the name and office of the spy._\r\n\r\nIf Alfieri was a manifest child of Melpomene, the third great\r\ndramatic writer of the age bore the impress of Thalia with no less\r\ndistinctness. CARLO GOLDONI’S memoirs paint with the utmost liveliness\r\nthe born comedian, careless, light-hearted, proof by a happy\r\ntemperament against all strokes of Fate, yet thoroughly respectable\r\nand honourable. Such characters abound in Italy, and wonderful it is\r\nthat only one member of so observant and lively a race should have won\r\nan European reputation as a comic author. Tragedy has in some measure\r\nflourished since the death of Alfieri, but Goldoni still stands alone.\r\nThe absence of any predecessor is explicable from the circumstances\r\nenumerated at the beginning of this chapter: the national style of\r\ncomedy was not literary, and no literary reputation could be built\r\nupon or out of it; while those who followed a different path produced\r\nsimply academic work devoid of all vitality. Goldoni broke the spell,\r\nand gave Italy a classical form of comedy, which has not indeed\r\nremained uncultivated, but has never since his time been cultivated\r\nby a master. He was born at Venice in 1707, and was the son of a\r\nphysician. His dramatic tastes were inherited from his grandfather, a\r\nModenese, and all the endeavours of his parents to direct his activity\r\ninto other channels came to nothing. He was indeed educated for a\r\nlawyer, graduated, held at different times a secretaryship and a\r\ncouncillorship, seemed to have settled steadily down to the practice of\r\nlaw, when an unexpected invitation carried him off to Venice, and for\r\nyears he did nothing but manage theatres and write plays, directing all\r\nhis energies to supersede the national Comedy of Masks, and comedies of\r\nintrigue dependent upon intricacy of plot, by representations of actual\r\nlife and manners. Many of his best plays were written in the Venetian\r\ndialect. At length (1761) umbrage, as was thought, at the vogue of\r\nGozzi’s fairy dramas induced Goldoni to accept a royal invitation to\r\nParis, where he spent the remainder of his life composing plays in\r\nFrench, and writing his memoirs in the same language. He survived\r\nthe downfall of the monarchy, and died in 1793, just as the pension\r\nof which he had been deprived was about to be restored to him. The\r\nfirst half of his life had been full of vicissitudes and entertaining\r\nadventures, agreeably recounted in his memoirs.\r\n\r\nThe future master of comedy commenced his dramatic career with a\r\nmelodrama, _Amalasunta_, which he burned, and followed this up with\r\nanother, of whose success he afterwards professed himself ashamed. He\r\nwas not long, nevertheless, in discovering his proper vocation; he\r\ninwardly, and from his point of view rightly--for he could never have\r\nbeen a Gozzi--declared war against the popular Comedy of Masks, and\r\nwhen a piece of his succeeded, whispered to himself, “Good, but not\r\nyet Molière.” The great Frenchman was the object of his idolatry, and\r\njustly, for not only was Molière the true monarch of the comic stage,\r\nbut his period was neither too near nor too remote, and his world\r\nneither too like nor unlike Goldoni’s, for successful imitation. By\r\n1753 Goldoni’s apprenticeship was over, and none but literary enemies\r\ncontested his title of the Italian Molière, a title confirmed by the\r\nsuffrage of posterity. _Un Curioso Accidente_, _Il Vero Amico_, _La\r\nBottega del Caffè_, _La Locandiera_, and many other comedies that\r\nmight be named, while true to the manners of a past age, retain all\r\ntheir freshness in our own. Italian audiences yet take delight in his\r\npictures of their ancestors. “One of the best theatres in Venice,” says\r\nSymonds, “is called by his name. His house is pointed out by gondoliers\r\nto tourists. His statue stands almost within sight of the Rialto. His\r\ncomedies are repeatedly given by companies of celebrated actors.” Yet\r\nas Cæsar called Terence a halved Menander, so we may term Goldoni a\r\nhalved Molière. The Menandrine element in Molière is present with\r\nhim; the Aristophanic is missing. Goldoni wants the French writer’s\r\noverpowering _vis comica_, and is happier in “catching the manners\r\nliving as they rise” than in laying bare the depths of the heart.\r\nWit, gaiety, elegance, simplicity, truth to nature, skill in dramatic\r\nconstruction, render him nevertheless a most delightful writer, and\r\nhis fame is the more assured from his position as his country’s sole\r\neminent representative in the region of polite comedy.\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century had thus endowed Italy with dramatic poets of\r\nEuropean reputation, worthy to be inscribed on the same roll as Racine\r\nand Molière. All the varied dramatic activity of the Cinque Cento,\r\nMachiavelli’s _Mandragola_ and the two great pastoral dramas excepted,\r\nbelonging essentially to a lower sphere, fails to counterweigh\r\nthe masterpieces of Alfieri and Goldoni. Even their achievement,\r\nnevertheless, did not amount to the creation of a national drama. If\r\ntragedy and comedy can be said to have taken root at all, the latter\r\ndegenerated, while the former put forth only sparse and occasional\r\nflowers. Alfieri’s best plays continue stock-pieces to this extent,\r\nthat they are revived as offering the most suitable opportunities for\r\nthe display of the brilliant histrionic genius which from time to\r\ntime irradiates the Italian stage. A succession of gifted men--Monti,\r\nFoscolo, Manzoni, Pellico, Niccolini, Cossa--have continued the\r\ntradition, and on the whole the state of tragedy seems much the same in\r\nItaly as in England. Comedy, on the other hand, notwithstanding some\r\nencouraging signs of revival, is far from vigorous, and the melodrama\r\nwhich occupies the stage is devoid of literary pretensions. Under\r\nthese discouraging circumstances it is not perhaps very extraordinary,\r\nthough assuredly it is very amusing, that the Italian _literati_ of\r\nthe present day, as reported by their interviewer-general, Signor\r\nOjetti, should gravely pronounce the drama which they cannot write\r\na rudimentary and superannuated form of art in comparison with the\r\nnovel which they can--_ein ueberwundener Standpunkt_, as would be\r\nsaid in Germany. The idea of modern romancers transcending the art of\r\nShakespeare and Sophocles is delightful from its modesty; but it must\r\nbe evident that the short story alone can rival the artistic finish of\r\na perfect drama, for every romance on a large scale must necessarily be\r\neked out by descriptions, reflections, and episodes unessential to the\r\nmain action.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the failure of the drama to establish itself in the land\r\nof opera is certainly not to be found in any preference on the part of\r\nthe public for the tedious psychological analysis of the modern school\r\nof fiction over the rapidity and variety of the stage, but rather in\r\nsome deep-seated trait of the national character. This is most probably\r\nthe prevailing sensuousness of the people--a term not here used in\r\nany disparaging sense, but as expressing the national preference for\r\nthe eye to the ear. _Segnius irritant_, as an ancient Italian has it.\r\nThe shows of the _Rappresentazioni_ were undoubtedly more attractive\r\nto the Florentine public than the verses which expounded them; and we\r\nhave seen that magnificent scenic equipments were needed to bring the\r\npeople to share the dramatic amusements of the courts of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. This tendency would probably be found to be inveterate, and\r\nto date from the period when the Atellan farces of Latium prefigured\r\nthe _Commedia dell’ Arte_. It was not mere love of bloodshed that\r\nmade gladiatorial shows popular at Rome. Professor Mahaffy remarks\r\nthat while the refinement of Terence’s translations from the Greek in\r\ncomparison with Plautus attests the improvement of the taste of the\r\nRoman aristocracy, “this brilliant success was not popular with the\r\nmasses, and led to no further attempts in the same direction.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n                              THE REVIVAL\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the Italy of the eighteenth century had fully entered\r\ninto the general intellectual movement of the rest of Europe. Scarcely\r\nany trace remained of the special characteristics of the Cinque\r\nCento except the imperishable tradition of culture and refinement\r\nwhich still kept literature at a high level of style. The vagaries\r\nof the seventeenth century had passed without leaving a trace. The\r\nprevailing taste was that of France. The chief exception to this\r\npolished uniformity was found in the drama. On the lyrical stage,\r\nItaly, favoured by the musical capabilities of her language and the\r\nsuperior aptitudes of her vocalists, had created something really\r\nnovel and national; and in the allied realm of instrumental music had\r\nemulated the architectural and pictorial triumphs of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. In tragedy and comedy, moreover, she had at length attained\r\nto a semblance of a national drama; but this, being the achievement\r\nof two exceptionally gifted men, who in comedy at all events left no\r\nworthy successors, was comparatively apart from the national life, and\r\ncould not be expected to prove an important element in the literary\r\ndevelopment of the future.\r\n\r\nWhat Italy was at that time as regards originality, she has continued\r\nto be until our own day. While claiming her full share in the conquests\r\nof science, and by no means behind-hand in the study of antiquity,\r\nshe has produced little that can be regarded as an absolute creation.\r\nLeopardi, alike in genius and art the most consummate among her men\r\nof letters, has wrought on old lines, exalting the forms he found to\r\nmore eminent perfection. Manzoni’s innovations are chiefly introduced\r\nfrom beyond the Alps. Carducci has rendered a priceless service in\r\nrepressing the language’s tendency to fluent inanity, and has widely\r\nexpanded its metrical capabilities, but has mainly worked upon hints\r\nderived from antique or foreign literatures. If, however, Italy\r\nhas originated none of the great movements which have transformed\r\nEuropean literature since the middle of the eighteenth century, she\r\nhas participated in them all. As she then fully associated herself\r\nwith the enlightened and humanising tendencies of that beneficent if\r\nprosaic age; she has since entered freely into the four great movements\r\nwhich have broken up eighteenth-century formality and bought life and\r\nliberty at the price of intellectual disorder--the naturalistic, the\r\nsentimental, the romantic, and the revolutionary.\r\n\r\nThe naturalistic impulse to the living and accurate description of\r\nnatural beauty, and the recognition of a living spirit in Nature, is\r\nno modern phenomenon. It is present as a vivifying influence in the\r\nclassics and in the poetry of Palestine and the East, and even more\r\nso in Celtic literature, where more than anywhere else it appears\r\nspontaneous and exempt from literary manipulation. Whether from a\r\nCeltic admixture of race or from some other reason, it seems among\r\nmodern literatures the more especial property of the British. The\r\ndescriptions of Shakespeare and Milton, like those of their Greek\r\npredecessors, may have been surpassed in the minute elaboration of\r\ndetail, not in truth or feeling. Spenser affords a still better\r\nexample, for--the multitudinous melodies of his peculiar stanza\r\nexcepted--this is the one point in which he transcends his Italian\r\nmodels. In propriety of plan, in human and dramatic interest, in\r\nterseness and polish of style, he is greatly their inferior; but the\r\nnatural descriptions of Ariosto and Tasso, beautiful as they often are,\r\nfall far behind his in rich warmth and glowing splendour.\r\n\r\nThis national gift fell into abeyance in the later half of the\r\nseventeenth century: there is scarcely a vestige of it in Dryden except\r\nwhere he reproduces Chaucer. Thomson’s _Seasons_ mark its revival,\r\nand were not without their effect in Europe; yet it must be owned\r\nthat its modern herald and hierophant is not a Briton, but a Swiss\r\njustly reckoned among French authors--Jean Jacques Rousseau. It was\r\nthe mission of this extraordinary man to inaugurate not merely the\r\nnaturalistic, but the sentimental movement also, which, taken up by\r\nSterne and Goethe, filled Europe with imitators, and, among other\r\nconsequences, gave a great impulse to the novel at the expense of the\r\ndrama. Neither the description of nature nor the analysis of feeling is\r\npeculiarly congenial to the Italian character, and it may be doubted\r\nwhether the latter impulse would have been very deeply felt but for the\r\nunhappy political circumstances of the country, which engendered among\r\nthe noblest minds a prevailing disgust and despair conducive to the\r\ndiffusion of morbid sentiment and a generally mournful cast of thought.\r\nBoth the naturalistic and the sentimental tendencies inaugurated by\r\nRousseau found a powerful representative in Ugo Foscolo.\r\n\r\nThe next great development of taste by which Italian literature came\r\nto be modified was one with which the Italian temperament has naturally\r\nso little sympathy, that the influence which it exercised and continues\r\nto exercise must be regarded as a strong proof of the susceptibility of\r\nItaly to all great currents affecting intellectual Europe. The romantic\r\nschool is at variance with all her literary traditions and all her\r\ncanons of taste. Had it been anything but an exotic, it would have come\r\ninto being centuries before among a people rich in popular legends,\r\nand whose history abounds with subjects adapted for ballad poetry.\r\nLittle, however, is seen or heard of it until, as the cosmopolitan\r\ndrift becomes more and more powerful, Shakespeare, Goethe, and Scott\r\nexcite the curiosity of the Italian reading public. One reason for\r\nthis backwardness may be plausibly alleged in the absence of Gothic\r\narchitecture from Italy. The earliest architectural remains were either\r\nclassical or Byzantine, which passed so easily into the Palladian and\r\nother modern Italian styles as to render Gothic architecture in Italy\r\nlittle more than an episode, and to leave no room for those impressions\r\nof vague sublimity and solemn grandeur which Gothic architecture\r\nproduces, and which so naturally spring up in the minds of the\r\ninhabitants of countries covered like England and Germany with ruined\r\ncastles and abbeys. Every feeling which the artist of the romantic\r\nschool would address is aroused by the mossed keeps and mouldering\r\nfanes of mediæval antiquity. Horace Walpole may have been a dilettante\r\nin architecture as in literature; nevertheless the romantic school in\r\nEngland is inaugurated by Strawberry Hill and the _Castle of Otranto_;\r\nand Goethe’s residence at Strasburg had much to do with _Goetz von\r\nBerlichingen_. When, on the other hand, the Northern man is initiated\r\ninto the beauties of Italian architecture, his romantic feeling is apt\r\nto wane, as he himself admits:\r\n\r\n      _’Tis not for centuries four for nought\r\n      Our European world of thought\r\n      Hath made familiar to its home\r\n      The classic mind of Greece and Rome;\r\n      In all new work that would look forth\r\n      To more than antiquarian worth,\r\n      Palladio’s pediments and bases,\r\n      Or something such, will find their places:\r\n      Maturer optics don’t delight\r\n      In childish dim religious light,\r\n      In evanescent vague effects\r\n      That shirk, not face, one’s intellects;\r\n      They love not fancies just betrayed,\r\n      And artful tricks of light and shade,\r\n      Put pure form nakedly displayed,\r\n      And all things absolutely made._\r\n\r\nThe feeling thus expressed by Clough, speaking through the mouth of\r\nthe Devil, is utterly contrary to the mystic awe and vague apprehension\r\nof infinity characteristic of romantic art. It is no wonder, therefore,\r\nthat the movement engendered towards the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury by impatience with the prosaic present and reaction towards\r\nthe neglected Middle Age, favoured by the moral atmosphere created by\r\nRousseau, and for England and Germany so imperious a necessity that\r\nWordsworth, Scott, Coleridge, Novalis and Tieck, all romanticists from\r\nthe cradle, appeared in the world within three years, should have\r\nbeen little heard of in Italy until Scott and Goethe had captivated\r\nthe youthful genius of Manzoni. Yet a streak of romantic light had\r\npreceded, though from quite a different quarter, namely, Ossian. If\r\nthe Gaelic bard’s antiquity was questionable, he was not the less\r\nacceptable to a modern imagination; and the prodigious success in all\r\nEuropean nations of what would have been universally derided thirty\r\nyears sooner, showed that new tastes and new cravings had been awakened\r\namong them. Of these Italy had her share, as attested, towards the end\r\nof the eighteenth century, by the vogue of the translation of Ossian by\r\nCesarotti.\r\n\r\nNot much need be said in this place of the last great factor in the\r\nliterary metamorphosis to which Italy, in common with the rest of\r\nEurope, had to conform herself. The Revolution modified literature by\r\naltering the environment of men of letters, supplying them with themes\r\nand ideas which could not otherwise have come within their scope, and\r\ninspiring them with vehement passions according as their circumstances\r\nand temperaments led them to champion the new gospel or rally to the\r\nancient traditions. Italy was one of the last countries to feel its\r\neffects in the literary sphere, chiefly because the movement did not,\r\nas elsewhere, originate in the land itself, but was thrust upon it\r\nby an invader whose rapine alienated much of the patriotic sentiment\r\nthat would otherwise have welcomed the Revolution. Monti, the first\r\ngreat Italian writer whose career was powerfully affected by it, was\r\nneither a revolutionist nor an anti-revolutionist, but a straw in a\r\nwhirlpool. When, however, the idea of Italian unity--Napoleon’s legacy\r\nto his true native country--had had time to develop itself, and it had\r\nbecome manifest that the only path to it lay through a cordial adoption\r\nof revolutionary principles, the Revolution acquired more practical\r\nsignificance for Italy than for any other country in Europe.\r\n\r\nIn a certain respect, Alfieri may be considered as the first\r\nrepresentative of both the sentimental and the national tendencies\r\nin modern Italian literature. He had denounced tyranny and extolled\r\nliberty while the Bastille had yet many years to stand; and if he\r\ncould not write like Goethe or Rousseau, he had practically lived, and\r\nrecorded in his autobiography, a life of sentimental passion. The air\r\nof the Revolution, nevertheless, was needed to bring these germs to\r\nmaturity. Its stimulating influence is especially conspicuous in the\r\ntone of Madame de Staël’s _Corinne_, compared with that of the letters\r\nof Goethe and Beckford. The landscape is the same, but is beheld in\r\nquite another light. Thus encouraged by general European sympathy, the\r\nrevolutionary and sentimental movements overpower the pliable Monti,\r\nand find a genuine representative in the moody and malcontent Foscolo.\r\nThe romantic movement, which Italy would hardly have originated for\r\nherself, necessarily came later, and found its leader in Manzoni.\r\nSilvio Pellico and others acceded, and connected these currents\r\nof feeling with the more decided revolutionary impulse of a later\r\ngeneration, typified in Leopardi, Giusti, and Mazzini.\r\n\r\nVINCENZO MONTI (1754-1828) is indeed no representative of the\r\nRevolution, for the most celebrated of his poems is a denunciation of\r\nit, and although he afterwards changed sides, the Republic was for\r\nhim merely a transition to the Empire. He nevertheless in a measure\r\npersonifies Italy herself amid the gusts of the revolutionary tempest,\r\ntossed to and fro between contending influences, her sails spread to\r\nthe sky, her anchor still cleaving to earth. Born in the district of\r\nFerrara, and having gone through the ordeal, so often exacted from\r\npoets, of distasteful law-study, he repaired to Rome as a literary\r\nadventurer, and by his splendid tercets on the Beauty of Nature and\r\nother lyrics adapted for recitation, sang himself into the good graces\r\nof the Papal court. He took a yet higher flight in his fine, rather\r\nlyrical than dramatic, tragedy of _Aristodemo_ (1787), as superior to\r\nAlfieri in versification as inferior in virile energy. The subject is\r\none of the most pathetic, the grief of a father for having slain his\r\ndaughter. The _Galeotto Manfredi_ (1788), partly inspired by private\r\ncircumstances, is interesting as one of the first Italian examples of\r\nromantic tragedy. One of the characters is copied from Iago.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1793 that Monti took rank as the first epic poet of\r\nhis time by his _Bassvilliana_, a poem on the murder of the French\r\ndiplomatist Bassville, who had perished in a tumult provoked by his\r\nown imprudence. Never since the tentmaker of Tarsus was caught up\r\ninto the third heaven was an obscure person elevated so mightily as\r\nthis insignificant Bassville, of whose remorseful spirit Monti’s\r\nardent imagination makes a new Dante, guided by an angel to behold\r\nthe atrocities of the French Revolution as a penance preliminary to\r\nits entrance into Paradise. In the whole compass of literature there\r\nis perhaps no other instance of so close and successful a copy as\r\nMonti’s of Dante, combined with so much impetuous vigour, and other\r\nqualities not usually associated with imitation. It revealed Monti as\r\nthe most impressionable of poets in his equal subjugation by Dantesque\r\ninfluences and by the passions of the hour. Such a man must needs move\r\nwith the times. Ere long the Papal courtier was the friend and guest\r\nof the French generals, inditing thundering odes against superstition\r\nand fanaticism; soon he held office under the Cisalpine Republic, and\r\nwhen the Austrians prevailed he fled to Paris. He came back as the\r\ncourtier and flatterer of Napoleon; and yet this versatility seems less\r\nthe effect of self-interest than of ductility of character, and his\r\ncountrymen laughingly talked of the three periods of the _abate_, the\r\n_citizen_, and the _cavalier_ Monti. This sensitiveness was serviceable\r\nto his lyric genius, for he thrilled with the emotion he wished to\r\nexpress, and in expressing it approved himself a perfect master of\r\nlanguage and metre.\r\n\r\nIn the interval between Monti’s withdrawal from Rome and the brilliant\r\nposition which under the Imperial auspices he acquired at Milan, he\r\nhad produced his _Prometheus_, one of the finest examples of Italian\r\nblank verse, but a curious mixture of things ancient and modern;\r\nhis _Musologia_, charming octaves on the Muses; _Caius Gracchus_, a\r\ntragedy betraying imitation of Shakespeare’s _Coriolanus_, celebrated\r\nfor the force of the fifth act; _Mascheroniana_, a palinode for the\r\n_Bassvilliana_, notwithstanding the art with which the poet manages\r\nto assert his consistency. Disfigured as it is by adulation of\r\nNapoleon and senseless abuse of England[21], this is perhaps Monti’s\r\nfinest poem. It is the offspring of a genuine poetic _œstrum_, which\r\nwhirls the stuff of a party pamphlet into sublimity, like a rag in a\r\nhurricane. It was never finished. Incomplete too is the _Bard of the\r\nBlack Forest_, a poem on Napoleon’s exploits, unequal to the subject,\r\nbut remarkable for its concise rapidity of expression. Monti was now\r\nNapoleon’s official laureate for the Italian department, and it is\r\nsufficiently amusing to find him expressing his apprehensions lest\r\nhe should be so far carried away by his patriotism as to offend the\r\nreigning powers, and breathing a superfluous prayer for prudence in his\r\nvocation. There was little danger; patriotism, though a genuine, was a\r\nweaker emotion with him than respect for dignities, as he sufficiently\r\nevinced by his obedience to the Austrian mandate to celebrate the\r\nexpulsion of the French, although he never abased himself so far as to\r\nassail Napoleon. He lost his office of historiographer, and retiring\r\ninto private life, devoted himself mainly to critical and philological\r\nwork. He had a short time previously published a translation of the\r\n_Iliad_, commenced in 1790, highly admired by his countrymen, and\r\ncertainly a remarkable performance when it is considered that he\r\nscarcely knew a word of Greek; whence Foscolo wittily called him\r\n_gran traduttor dei traduttor d’Omero_. So much more important to\r\nthe translator is flexibility of mind than exactness of scholarship.\r\nMonti’s later days, now embittered by controversies and pecuniary\r\nembarrassments, mitigated by the generosity of friends, now brightened\r\nby successful work on his unfinished _Feronia_, a youthful production\r\nin which he had celebrated the draining of the Pontine marshes, or by\r\nthe production of some fine lyric, passed on the whole tranquilly until\r\nhis death in 1828 from the effects of a paralytic stroke.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eloquent but unspeculative Monti had nothing to teach but his\r\nalmost inimitable art of verbal expression, and hence has founded\r\nno school. His reputation has declined, chiefly from the ephemeral\r\ncharacter of the themes on which his genius was expended, and of which\r\nnone but himself could have made so much. He can hardly be called\r\na great poet, if for no other reason than that his impressionable\r\nimagination wanted tenacity; he tired of his own works, and left the\r\nmajority of them incomplete. He is nevertheless a brilliant phenomenon,\r\nthe more interesting from the decidedly national stamp of his genius.\r\nHe has Southern demonstrativeness and volubility, and kindles like a\r\nmeteor by his own flight; when thoroughly fired, whether in epic or\r\nlyric, he is almost an improvisatore. Improvisation in an English poet\r\nwould seem a _tour de force_ at best, but it appears natural to the\r\nquick intelligence and musical speech of Italy.\r\n\r\nMonti is thus a representative of his nation, and is no less true\r\nto the general spirit of his epoch: classic in aspiration, modern\r\nin sentiment, related to the Greeks much as Canova was related to\r\nPhidias. He was no interpreter of his age, but a faithful mirror of its\r\nsuccessive phases, and endowed with the rare gift of sublimity to a\r\ndegree scarcely equalled by any contemporary except Goethe, Byron, and\r\nShelley. The descriptions in the _Mascheroncide_ of Napoleon’s descent\r\nupon Italy, and of the inundation of the Po, if not perfect models of\r\ntaste, are almost Lucretian in their stormy and tumultuous grandeur.\r\nThe frequent poverty, or at least shallowness of his thought is veiled\r\nby splendid diction; and in tact and felicity of encomium he recalls\r\nDryden, whom he so strongly resembles in the character of many of his\r\ncompositions, the versatility of his conduct, and the circumstances\r\nof his life. A further analogy may be found in the eminence of both\r\nas critics, Monti’s disquisitions on Dante and the Cruscan vocabulary\r\nconstituting as important a portion of his work as Dryden’s prefaces of\r\nhis. His dialogues, chiefly between deceased authors and grammarians\r\nrecalled from the shades to discuss philological questions, are\r\ncharming for their elegance and grace.\r\n\r\nUGO FOSCOLO (1778-1827), the second eminent poet of the revolutionary\r\nperiod, successively Monti’s champion and his adversary, is in most\r\nrespects a violent contrast to him. It would have been well had\r\nhe been merely his complement. Monti’s pliant character greatly\r\nneeded an infusion of vigour and independence; but Foscolo, though a\r\nself-restrained artist in his poems, in his life required the curb as\r\nmuch as Monti required the spur. Worse, his tempestuous vehemence and\r\ncrabbed indocility were no tokens of real strength; he was at bottom\r\nweak and whimsical, the slave of passion, physical and intellectual.\r\nHis countrymen, nevertheless, have forgotten his faults and follies\r\nfor the sake of his untarnished patriotism, most unjustly suspected in\r\nhis own day; he is the first very distinguished modern Italian whose\r\nconsistency in this particular is a source of national joy and pride.\r\nAlfieri’s resentment against the French, though sufficiently excusable,\r\nblinded him to the real tendency of his times; other well-meaning men\r\nwere either too intimately associated with the temporary makeshift of\r\nthe despotic Empire, or too amenable to clerical pressure. Foscolo was\r\nuntainted by either influence, and might be deemed not only absolved\r\nbut canonised by his countrymen when Garibaldi made a pilgrimage to\r\nhis tomb at Chiswick, and when, in 1871, his remains were transferred\r\nto the cemetery at Florence, the inspiration of the most famous of his\r\npoems.\r\n\r\nAlike in personal character and the quality of his productions,\r\nFoscolo may be compared with Landor, but with the capital distinction\r\nthat Landor was a man of the past, and Foscolo, for all his Greek\r\nerudition and classical enthusiasm, a man of his own time. His romance,\r\n_Jacopo Ortis_ (1798), perhaps the most celebrated of his productions,\r\nis a reminiscence of _Werther_ and a forerunner of _René_, but adds to\r\nthe merely personal sorrows of these tragic autobiographies the nobler\r\nmotive of despair at the ruin and enslavement of the hero’s country.\r\nFoscolo, though born at Zante, was prouder of his Venetian descent than\r\nof his Greek nativity, and the ignominious end of so glorious a history\r\nas the Republic’s not unnaturally or ignobly drove him to despair. At\r\nthe same time he was usually under the spell of some woman; one of\r\nhis genuine letters, indeed, written at a much later date, surpasses\r\nhis romance in the eloquence of unhappy passion. Both motives combine\r\nto drive Ortis to suicide. Apart from its impressive style, the book\r\nis weak and unwholesome, but it powerfully depicts an unquestionable\r\ntendency of the age, and as such has a right to live, apart from its\r\ninfluence on Leopardi, George Sand, and other more recent writers of\r\ngenius. Foscolo’s melancholy, fretful and egotistic as it is, is not\r\npessimism; it is not grounded in the nature of things, but is always\r\nremediable by a change in external circumstances.\r\n\r\nUnlike the exuberant Monti, Foscolo wrote little poetry, but his\r\nscanty production is of choice quality. His most celebrated poem is\r\nthe _Sepolcri_ (1807), which in style and subject bears a remarkable\r\nresemblance to the finest poem America has yet given to the world,\r\nBryant’s _Thanatopsis_. The American poet has conceived his work in\r\na larger and grander spirit, and consequently surpasses Foscolo in\r\nthe sublimity of his thought, though the latter’s poem is longer and\r\nadorned with episodes, and in merit of execution there may be little to\r\nchoose. Bryant dwells on the majesty of death; Foscolo on the reverence\r\ndue to the tomb, and the immortality of the memories of the great--a\r\nfine theme undoubtedly, and deserving of the monumental eloquence\r\nwith which he has adorned it, but small if measured against Bryant’s.\r\nFoscolo’s other most considerable poetical composition, his _Hymns to\r\nthe Graces_, celebrated as the beneficent spirits of Greece, Italy,\r\nand an ideal world, was long but an aggregation of fragments, and was\r\nrecovered as a whole only in 1856. The fastidious author could never\r\nsatisfy himself, and the result is a production more remarkable for\r\nhigh polish than warmth of poetic feeling. It is just such a poem as\r\nLandor might have written. Foscolo’s tragedies, _Ajax_ and _Ricciarda_,\r\nare fine compositions in the spirit of Alfieri: the former,\r\nnotwithstanding its classical theme, has a relation to contemporary\r\ncircumstances, Moreau being depicted as Ajax, and Bonaparte as\r\nAgamemnon. The few minor poems of Foscolo are admirable, full of\r\nweighty lines that imprint themselves on the memory. As a critic he\r\naccomplished more than it will be easy to accomplish after him, coming\r\njust at the moment when Europe, weary of the superficial æsthetics of\r\nthe eighteenth century, was anxiously looking for a guide to the spirit\r\nof the past. It is as much by this happy fortune as by their intrinsic\r\nmerit that his essays mark an era in the literary history of Dante,\r\nPetrarch, Tasso, and Boccaccio.\r\n\r\nFoscolo’s agitated life has afforded matter for many biographers,\r\nbut the essential facts lie in narrow compass. Born in Zante of mixed\r\nVenetian and Greek parentage, he early sought Venice, and learned\r\nthe secret of literary style from Cesarotti, the translator of\r\nOssian. The shameful extinction of the Venetian Republic by France\r\nand Austria combined with his own ill-regulated passions to make him\r\nwrite _Jacopo Ortis_ and talk of imitating his suicidal hero. A spell\r\nof military service, partly at the siege of Genoa, partly in the army\r\ndestined for the invasion of England, went far to cure him, and he\r\nspent several years as a man of letters at Milan, translating Homer,\r\ncomposing his tragedies, and too much engaged in unedifying literary\r\nquarrels for his own dignity or the credit of letters. He showed an\r\nhonourable independence in rejecting the bribes offered to induce him\r\nto adulate Napoleon, and, equally spurning the proffered subvention\r\nof the Austrian Government, became an exile at the overthrow of the\r\nEmpire. He ultimately took refuge in England, exchanged, he might have\r\nboasted, for Byron. Here he was warmly received in aristocratic as well\r\nas literary circles, and might have performed a distinguished part.\r\nBut his extravagance and his irregular habits wore out his friends’\r\npatience, though Mr. Smiles says: “Ugo Foscolo lived to the end of\r\nhis life surrounded by all that was luxurious and beautiful.” If so,\r\nHudson Gurney, who raised his tomb, must have given him bread as well\r\nas a stone. He was also affectionately tended by his natural daughter,\r\nwhose mother was an Englishwoman. He died in September 1827. Some of\r\nhis best critical work belongs to this last period, and a valuable\r\ncorrespondence from English friends is understood to be awaiting\r\npublication. His own letters are admirable, full of life and movement.\r\n\r\nLittle as IPPOLITO PINDEMONTE (1754-1825) resembled Foscolo either\r\nas an author or as a man, their names are frequently associated on\r\naccount of Pindemonte’s reply to Foscolo’s _Sepolcri_, a fine poem\r\nbreathing the spirit of resignation and tranquillity, for which his\r\ngloomy predecessor had left him abundant scope. Pindemonte’s best\r\nproduction, however, is his _Antonio Foscarini_, a true tale of unhappy\r\nlove, recited with great pathos in elegant octaves. He is a kind of\r\nItalian Cowper, a gentle and amiable valetudinarian. Like Cowper, he\r\nsang country life, and touched the events and the manners of his times\r\nin a strain of soft elegiac melancholy; like Cowper, too, he translated\r\nHomer. He holds no such important position in Italian as Cowper\r\ndoes in English literature, but represents the large class of his\r\nfellow-citizens who, carrying the spirit of the eighteenth century into\r\nthe nineteenth, were rather ornamental than useful to their country.\r\n\r\nMonti and Foscolo, with all their genius, could not escape the\r\ninfluence of their times. In the French and Italian literature of the\r\nImperial period, and still more in its art, a certain pseudo-classical\r\naffectation is visible. Sublimity and grace are attained indeed, but\r\nthere is something mannered about the one, and something fastidious\r\nabout the other. The reigning taste required to be brought nearer\r\nto Nature, and the writer who could effect this was sure to mark an\r\nepoch in the literature of his country. The mission was discharged by\r\nALESSANDRO MANZONI (1785-1873), a man who announces a new departure in\r\nmany ways, and whose historical significance, even more than his fine\r\ngenius, places him above the still more gifted Leopardi at the head of\r\nthe Italian literature of the first half of the nineteenth century.\r\nFrom one point of view he signalises the invasion of the romantic\r\nspirit. Goethe, Byron, Shakespeare, Scott are more to him than the old\r\nItalian masters. From another, he founds the Neo-Catholic school, and\r\npersonifies the revival of the religious spirit in its most gentle and\r\nedifying form. Monti and Foscolo had been sceptics; Manzoni is devout,\r\nwhile at the same time there is nothing grotesque in his mediævalism,\r\nand he keeps the spheres of religion and politics so apart as to be\r\nable to hail the downfall of the temporal power. Yet, again, he is\r\na reformer of the language, and the first to form a style equally\r\nacceptable to his cultured and to his unlettered countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe hero of these various achievements was singularly unlike the usual\r\ntype of great renovators and innovators. Such epoch-making personages\r\nrarely want for self-assertion. Manzoni was a gentle, undemonstrative\r\nman, though observant of others and not ignorant of his own worth, and\r\ncapable of sarcasm on occasion; a valetudinarian, whose dread of crowds\r\nfrequently confined him to his house, who made no display, mounted no\r\nrostrum, and ceased to write at forty. Hence, though _I Promessi Sposi_\r\nis probably more widely known than any Italian book after the _Divina\r\nCommedia_, the author has failed to personally impress the European\r\nimagination, and appears a mere shadow in comparison with Victor Hugo\r\nor even Lamartine, neither of whom, notwithstanding their infinitely\r\ngreater productiveness, so profoundly influenced the literature of\r\ntheir country. Born at Milan, Manzoni was an Austrian subject, and,\r\nthough a true patriot, shunned to offend the ruling powers. He led\r\nthe life of a respectable Italian gentleman of moderate fortune, at\r\none time greatly impaired by his father’s extravagance, and basked\r\nfor nearly half a century in the tranquil enjoyment of European fame,\r\nwhich, after the success of _I Promessi Sposi_, he imperilled by no\r\nfurther venture. “Formerly,” he said in excuse, “the Muse came after\r\nme, now I should have to go after her.” The events of 1848 failed to\r\ndraw him from his retirement; when the unity of Italy was accomplished\r\nhe accepted public honours, but declined public duties; none criticised\r\nhis inaction, for all felt that he had done his best by Italy. His\r\ndeath at the age of eighty-eight evoked such a unanimity of sentiment\r\nas has perhaps accompanied that of no great author of modern times\r\nexcept Sir Walter Scott. Goethe had hostile detractors. Settembrini and\r\nthe few others who presumed to criticise Manzoni urged their scruples\r\nin a spirit of becoming reverence.\r\n\r\nManzoni’s claim to this universal veneration was three-fold. In\r\nthe first place, he was really a great writer; in the second, he\r\nwas the standard-bearer of Italian literature, the one contemporary\r\nauthor of his nation who could be named along with Goethe and Byron;\r\nthirdly and chiefly, he represented the most important intellectual\r\nmovement of the post-Napoleonic age, the romantic and mediæval\r\nreaction--a necessity, for justice demanded it. The Middle Age was\r\nindeed no model for the nineteenth century, as the romanticists and\r\nreactionaries thought, but it did possess elements indispensable for\r\nthe enrichment of the national life; and although the Italian mind\r\nwas probably less in harmony with these than the mind of any other\r\npeople, no Italian could forget that the greatest of his countrymen\r\nwas also the greatest and most representative writer of the Middle\r\nAges. It had been one of Monti’s chief merits to have emulated and\r\nrevived the style of Dante, to the disgust of Pope Pius VI., who asked\r\nhim why on earth he could not write like Metastasio. After the form\r\ncame the spirit of the _Divine Comedy_, commended to the nation by\r\nthe misfortunes and deceptions which succeeded the fall of Napoleon,\r\nwhen the exile of Florence appeared more than ever a symbol of his\r\ncountry. The worshippers of Dante were indeed divided, some seeing in\r\nhim the Ghibelline, the enemy of the temporal power no less than of the\r\nforeigner; others, the apostle of mediæval Catholicism. Both views were\r\nright and both wrong, and the choice between them was merely a matter\r\nof temperament, but the latter was the more likely to be propagated by\r\nthe air of the time.\r\n\r\nThe gentle and modest Manzoni obeyed the more potent influence. In\r\n1812 he began to produce his hymns, mostly on the festivals of the\r\nChurch, which perhaps suggested Keble’s _Christian Year_. They were\r\npublished in 1815, but the finest, that for Whitsunday, is a later\r\naddition. They attracted little attention until the appearance of\r\nhis famous ode on the death of Napoleon, _Il Cinque Maggio_, which,\r\nappearing at the right “psychological moment,” at a time when every\r\nman felt almost as an intimate of the great conqueror who had made so\r\nlarge a portion of his own existence, took Italy and Europe by storm.\r\nThe note of personal compassion which pervades it was then in place,\r\nbut now that Napoleon’s exploits and disasters are ancient history, and\r\nhe is chiefly regarded as a great world-shaker and incarnate elemental\r\nforce, we feel the need of a deeper insight and a wider sweep. Even\r\nManzoni’s fire and eloquence, vivid as they are, scarcely rival\r\nLamartine’s on the same subject. A patriotic poem of equal power, the\r\node on the march of the Piedmontese volunteers to succour the Lombards\r\nin 1821, imaginary as fact, but veracious as prophecy, has suffered\r\nless, or indeed nothing, from the lapse of time, expressing the deepest\r\nfeelings of every Italian heart now as then. Though composed in 1821,\r\nit was not so much as written down until 1848, from apprehension of the\r\nAustrian police. No less fine are the lyrics in Manzoni’s tragedies,\r\nthe _Carmagnola_ (1820) and the _Adelchi_ (1822).\r\n\r\nThese dramas themselves mark an epoch in Italian literary history,\r\nnot so much from their absolute merit, as from being the first\r\nattempt to adapt Shakespearian methods to the Italian drama. Alfieri\r\nand Monti had adhered to the classical school; Manzoni struck into\r\na new path, and by so doing revealed a new world to his countrymen,\r\nlittle as it followed that the old world need be entirely forsaken.\r\nThe _Carmagnola_ depicts the condottieri of the fifteenth century,\r\nthe _Adelchi_ the Lombards of the eighth. The latter is the more\r\ndramatic, and the two principal characters, Adelchi and Ermengarda,\r\nare depicted with extreme beauty and power. The pieces, however, are\r\nrather dramatic poems than plays, and rise highest where there is most\r\nscope for poetry. Martin the Deacon’s description of his journey in the\r\n_Adelchi_, for instance, so finely translated by Mr. W. D. Howells, is\r\nmagnificent, but on a scale disproportioned to the play. The fire and\r\nspirit of the two martial lyrics in the _Carmagnola_ and the _Adelchi_\r\nrespectively are marvellous; “their wonderful plunging metre,” it\r\nhas been said, “suggests a charge of horses.” That in the _Adelchi_\r\nshould alone vindicate Manzoni against the accusation of unpatriotic\r\nlukewarmness. It paints the lot of the Italian people of the eighth\r\ncentury, transferred by the fortune of war from a Lombard master to a\r\nFrank, who unite to oppress them, and nothing can be more evident than\r\nthe contemporary application to Italian, Austrian, and Frenchman. The\r\nfollowing slightly abridged version is by Miss Ellen Clerke:\r\n\r\n      _From moss-covered ruin of edifice nameless,\r\n      From forests, from furnaces idle and flameless,\r\n        From furrows bedewed with the sweat of the slave,\r\n      A people dispersed doth arouse and awaken,\r\n      With senses all straining and pulses all shaken,\r\n        At a sound of strange clamour that swells like a wave._\r\n\r\n      _In visages pallid, and eyes dim and shrouded,\r\n      As blinks the pale sun through a welkin beclouded,\r\n        The might of their fathers a moment is seen;\r\n      In eye and in countenance doubtfully blending,\r\n      The shame of the present seems dumbly contending\r\n        With pride in the thought of a past that hath been._\r\n\r\n      _Now they gather in hope to disperse panic-stricken,\r\n      And in tortuous ways their pace slacken or quicken,\r\n        As, ’twixt longing and fear, they advance or stand still,\r\n      Gazing once and again where, despairing and scattered,\r\n      The host of their tyrants flies broken and shattered\r\n        From the wrath of the swords that are drinking their fill._\r\n\r\n      _As wolves that the hunter hath cowed and subjected,\r\n      Their hair on their hides in dire horror erected,\r\n        So these to their covert distractedly fly;\r\n      And hope springs anew in the breast of the peasant;\r\n      O’ertaking the future in joy of the present,\r\n        He deems his chain broken, and broken for aye._\r\n\r\n      _Nay, hearken! Yon heroes in victory warring,\r\n      From refuge and rescue the routed debarring,\r\n        By path steep and rugged have come from afar,\r\n      Forsaking the halls of their festive carousing,\r\n      From downy repose on soft couches arousing,\r\n        In haste to obey the shrill summons of war._\r\n\r\n      _They have left in their castles their wives broken-hearted,\r\n      Who, striving to part, still refused to be parted,\r\n        With pleadings and warnings that died on the tongue.\r\n      The war-dinted helmet the brow hath surmounted,\r\n      And soon the dark chargers are saddled and mounted,\r\n        And hollow the bridge to their gallop hath rung._\r\n\r\n      _From land unto land they have speeded and fleeted,\r\n      With lips that the lay of the soldier repeated,\r\n        But hearts that have harboured their home and its bowers.\r\n      They have watched, they have starved, by grim discipline driven,\r\n      And hauberk and helm have been battered and riven,\r\n        And arrows around them have whistled in showers._\r\n\r\n      _And deem ye, poor fools! that the meed and the guerdon\r\n      That lured from afar were to lighten your burden,\r\n        Your wrongs to abolish, your fate to reverse?\r\n      Go! back to the wrecks of your palaces stately,\r\n      To the forges whose glow ye extinguished so lately,\r\n        To the field ye have tilled in the sweat of your curse!_\r\n\r\n      _The victor and vanquished, in amity knitted,\r\n      Have doubled the yoke to your shoulders refitted;\r\n        One tyrant had quelled you, and now ye have twain.\r\n      They cast forth the lot for the serf and the cattle,\r\n      They throne on the sods that yet bleed from their battle,\r\n        And the soil and the hind are their servants again._\r\n\r\nIf Manzoni was surpassed as a dramatist and equalled as a lyrist by\r\nothers among his countrymen, he has hitherto found no competitor as\r\na novelist. _I Promessi Sposi_ (1825) was the first great Italian\r\nromance, and it remains the greatest. It would be difficult to\r\ntranscend its capital merits, the beauty and truth of description,\r\nthe interest of its leading characters, and its perfect fidelity\r\nto life, if not in every respect to the place and period where and\r\nwhen the scene is laid--Milan under the dreary Spanish rule of the\r\nseventeenth century--yet to the universal feelings and instincts of\r\nhumanity. As a picture of human nature the book is above criticism;\r\nit is just the fact, neither more nor less. “It satisfies us,” said\r\nGoethe, “like perfectly ripe fruit.” It has, notwithstanding, a weak\r\nside, which Goethe did not fail to point out--the prominence of the\r\nhistorical element, and the dryness with which the writer exhibits his\r\nauthorities, instead of dissolving them in the flow of his narrative.\r\n“The German translator,” said Goethe, “must get rid of a great part of\r\nthe war and the famine, and two-thirds of the plague.” Other objections\r\nto Manzoni’s romance refer to its real or supposed tendencies, which\r\nleave its artistic merits unaffected. It may be granted that panegyrics\r\nupon Cardinal Federigo Borromeo, however just, were hardly seasonable\r\nwhen the Pope was the fast ally of the Austrian; and Manzoni did still\r\nworse by his country when (1819) he wrote a treatise on Catholic\r\nMorals, unexceptionable when there should be no more question of the\r\nTemporal Power. But he then cherished generous illusions which he\r\nwas ultimately obliged to renounce; though never parting with one of\r\nthe leading and most remarkable features of _I Promessi Sposi_, its\r\nsympathy with the poor and lowly. It is a remarkable proof of the\r\ndifficulties of style which beset the Italian author, that Manzoni\r\nfound it necessary to give his romance a thorough revision to bring its\r\ndiction nearer to the Tuscan standard. His other prose works comprise,\r\nthe _Column of Infamy_, an historical appendix to _I Promessi Sposi_,\r\n_Letters on Romanticism_, an able polemic on behalf of the romantic\r\nschool, and _Letters on the Unities of Time and Place_, demonstrating\r\nthat the unity of action is the only unity which need be regarded by\r\nthe dramatist.\r\n\r\nThe success of _I Promessi Sposi_ could not but create a school of\r\nhistorical novelists in Italy, whose works probably effected more for\r\nthe propagation of Italian literature beyond the Alps than those of\r\nany writer except Manzoni himself. The _Marco Visconti_ of Tommaso\r\nGrossi, the _Ettorre Fieramosca_ of Massimo d’Azeglio, the _Margherita\r\nPusterla_ of Cesare Cantù, are romances of great merit, but, as the\r\nauthor of one of them exclaims, “How far we are behind Manzoni!”\r\n\r\nLittle as any anti-national motive can be attributed to the _Adelchi_,\r\nit is true that Manzoni’s patriotism was chiefly evinced in his lyrics,\r\nand that he was not prominent as a patriotic dramatist. This part was\r\nreserved for GIOVANNI BATTISTA NICCOLINI (1782-1861). In times of\r\ntrial and distress the measure of service is apt to be the measure of\r\napplause, and popular gratitude may for a time have exalted Niccolini’s\r\ntragedies to a higher level than that due to their strictly literary\r\ndesert. They are nevertheless fine productions, and the most patriotic\r\nare usually the best. _Arnaldo di Brescia_, too bold an apotheosis\r\nof the fiery monk who defied the Papacy in the twelfth century to be\r\nprinted in Italy for many years after its appearance in France, is\r\nthe most poetical, but is neither intended nor adapted for the stage.\r\nNotwithstanding its historical subject, this mighty tragedy, as Mr. W.\r\nD. Howells, the translator of some of its finest passages, not unjustly\r\nterms it, is an idealistic work. The other dramas, taken from history,\r\nand representing such crises in Italian story as the destruction of\r\nFlorentine liberty and the Sicilian Vespers, are more compliant with\r\nordinary dramatic rules; but the most celebrated and successful on the\r\nstage is _Antonio Foscarini_, founded on the same incident in Venetian\r\nhistory that had afforded the subject of Pindemonte’s poem. Before he\r\nbecame imbued with the spirit of the romantic school, Niccolini had\r\nacquired great distinction as a classical dramatist, especially by his\r\n_Polissena_ and his _Medea_. His first performance, _Nabucco_ (1816),\r\nidealised the fall of Napoleon in a Babylonian tragedy. Among his plays\r\nis a free translation of Shelley’s _Cenci_, in general excellent,\r\nbut remarkable for the entire disfigurement of the opening speech,\r\nno doubt for prudential reasons. At first poor, afterwards in easy\r\ncircumstances, Niccolini spent an uneventful life in the service of\r\nthe Academy of Florence; his mode of living was sequestered, and his\r\ncharacter stainless.\r\n\r\nWith all his good-will, Niccolini could deal no such blows at foreign\r\nor domestic oppressors as that which a brother dramatist of greatly\r\ninferior power delivered by the mere record of his sufferings. _Le Mie\r\nPrigioni_ made SILVIO PELLICO (1789-1854) as typical a figure as the\r\nIron Mask or the Prisoner of Chillon, and won Italy a moral victory\r\nin her darkest day (1832). It is needless to give any particular\r\naccount of so famous a book. The candid and innocent author was born\r\nto move mankind by a single story, and to relapse into obscurity after\r\ndelivering his message. His dramas and lyrics do not exceed mediocrity,\r\nwith the exception of _Francesca da Rimini_ (1818), a tragedy full of\r\ntender feeling, admired by Byron, to whom the version of some scenes in\r\nthe _Quarterly Review_ has been attributed. They were, however, in fact\r\nrendered by Milman.\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] _Impatient to put out the only light Of Liberty that yet remains\r\non Earth!_\r\n\r\n                                              --WORDSWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV\r\n                           THE REGENERATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThat only one of the distinguished writers reviewed in the last\r\nchapter should have given free expression to the Italian craving for\r\nliberty and national unity, may be accounted for in the simplest\r\npossible manner. Foscolo was the only one in exile; the unexpatriated,\r\nwriting under a censorship, said not what they would, but what they\r\ncould. Apart, nevertheless, from this consideration, it is true that\r\nthe national movement was slow in acquiring energy and consistency,\r\ninasmuch as it was not in the first instance an indigenous growth.\r\nThe conception of an Italian nation under a single political head had\r\nnot been too clearly formulated, even by Petrarch and Machiavelli,\r\nand since the latter’s time had been in great measure the exclusive\r\npossession of the finest minds. As an upbursting bubble may hint at\r\nwhat is passing in the depths of the sea, so Gernando’s scoff in the\r\n_Gerusalemme Liberata_ at Rinaldo as a native of _la serva Italia_\r\nreveals the hidden workings of Tasso’s spirit, and vindicates him from\r\nthe charge of ludicrously servile adulation. Nothing more ridiculous\r\ncan be conceived than the poet’s notion that his patron Alphonso might\r\nwell lead either the armies or the fleets of Europe in a new crusade if\r\nhe was to be no more than a Duke of Ferrara; not so if the headship of\r\na united and regenerated Italy was to fall to him.\r\n\r\nThe next generation reposed hopes premature, indeed--yet, as the\r\nfar-off event was to show, not irrational--in the house of Savoy; but\r\nas time wore on and material circumstances improved, these patriotic\r\naspirations waned, and the call for liberty which came from France in\r\nthe revolutionary era had to create the sentiment to which it appealed.\r\nAny prospect of such a response seemed destroyed by the behaviour of\r\nthe French propaganda itself--its infamous betrayal of the Venetian\r\nRepublic, its exactions from private fortunes, pillages from public\r\ntreasuries, and wholesale robbery of Italian works of art. Yet by an\r\nextraordinary turn of events the chief perpetrator of these iniquities,\r\nhimself an Italian, became most undesignedly on his own part the father\r\nof Italian unity and freedom. By crowning himself King of Italy,\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte gave her a national existence. After a few years of\r\nhis rule the inhabitants of the peninsula could not but perceive that\r\nthe visions of their seers and the aspirations of their statesmen had\r\nin great measure come to pass.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the existence of some nominally independent\r\nprincipalities, for the first time since Theodoric the Italians of the\r\nNorth at all events actually were Italians--not Lombards, or Tuscans,\r\nor Piedmontese. They were indeed ruled by a despot; but to this, with\r\nthe practical instinct of their race, the Italians submitted in the\r\nprevision that Napoleon’s empire must be dissolved by his death, and\r\nthe hope that the national unity would survive it and him. Such might\r\nwell have been the case had his authority been peacefully transmitted\r\nto a successor; but the circumstances of his downfall inevitably\r\nbrought back the Austrians and the exiled princes, to reign no longer\r\nover a contented or an indifferent people, but over one which had taken\r\nthe idea of national unity to its heart. The effect on literature is\r\nillustrated by a passage in one of Byron’s letters from Italy: “They\r\ntalk Dante, write Dante, and think and dream Dante to an extent that\r\nwould be ridiculous but that he deserves it.” It was not so much the\r\nrecognition of Dante’s literary desert which occasioned this reaction\r\nfrom eighteenth-century neglect, as the incarnation of the sufferings\r\nand the genius of his country in his person.\r\n\r\nA generation thus nurtured on Dante, and on Dante studied from such\r\na point of view, could not but grow up serious and patriotic. Nor\r\nwere other literary influences wanting. The fourth canto of _Childe\r\nHarold_, and even more Madame de Staël’s _Corinne_, contrasted in the\r\nmost forcible manner the past artistic and intellectual glories with\r\nthe actual political degradation, and showed Italy how far she had\r\nfallen, but also how high she might hope to reascend. Such influences\r\nimbued the youthful generation with a more impassioned and enthusiastic\r\ncharacter than its fathers. The new aspirations embodied themselves\r\nmost distinctly in three men--Mazzini, type of physical resistance\r\nto oppression; Giusti, of relentless opposition in the intellectual\r\nsphere; Leopardi, of the passive protest of martyrdom. In him, as by an\r\nemblem, the beauty and the anguish of the suffering country are shown\r\nforth, and on this account no less than from the superiority of his\r\nliterary genius, though no active insurgent against the established\r\norder of things, he claims the first place in his hapless but glorious\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nThe tragical yet uneventful life of GIACOMO LEOPARDI was little else\r\nthan ardent cultivation of the spirit and constant struggle with the\r\ninfirmities of the body. Born in 1798 at Recanati, a small dull town\r\nnear Rimini, the son of a learned and high-minded, but unfortunately\r\nbigoted and retrograde Italian nobleman, of anti-national politics and\r\nantiquarian tastes, whose embarrassed circumstances and incapacity for\r\nbusiness had induced him to assign his property to a practical but\r\nparsimonious wife, Leopardi solaced the forlornness of existence in a\r\nspiritual desert by intense study, favoured by his father’s extensive\r\nlibrary, in which he immured himself to a degree propitious to neither\r\nbodily nor mental health. So extraordinary were his powers that at\r\nnineteen, besides many excellent _bonâ fide_ translations, he produced\r\nimaginary versions of lost Greek authors which deceived accomplished\r\nclassical scholars. But the maladies from which he was to suffer all\r\nhis life had already made progress; he could follow no profession, and\r\nwas entirely dependent upon well-intentioned but uncongenial parents,\r\nwhose dread of the liberal and free-thinking opinions he had imbibed,\r\nchiefly from correspondence with Pietro Giordani, induced them to\r\nimprison him at home.\r\n\r\nThough solaced by the affection of his brother Carlo and his sister\r\nPaolina, Leopardi’s position was most uncomfortable, and the chief\r\nexternal events of his history for many years are his temporary escapes\r\nand his enforced returns. He sought refuge successively at Rome,\r\nBologna, and Florence, meeting with friends everywhere, especially at\r\nRome, where he won the esteem and excited the wonder of Niebuhr and\r\nBunsen. His craving for deeper sympathy twice involved him in love\r\naffairs, both fruitful in humiliation and disappointment. Nothing else,\r\nindeed, could be expected for the suit of the pallid, deformed youth,\r\nwhose blood barely circulated, whose indigestion almost deprived him\r\nof nourishment, whose feeble limbs bent beneath the weight of a body\r\neven so attenuated, and whose heart and lungs scarcely discharged\r\ntheir office. All active life seemed concentrated in his brain, which\r\nthrove and energised at the expense of every other organ. He executed\r\nsome work for the booksellers, especially his condensed but invaluable\r\ncomment on Petrarch, and from time to time gave expression to some\r\nslowly-maturing thought, in literary form meet for immortality, but\r\nunvalued and unrecompensed by his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nNeither Leopardi’s patriotic sentiments nor his speculative opinions\r\ncould be disclosed under the pressure of Austrian and Bourbon\r\ndespotism; the King of Sardinia had not yet declared himself on the\r\nside of liberty, and there was literally no spot in Italy where an\r\nItalian could write what he thought. Emigration to France or England\r\nwould have been forbidden by his parents, upon whom he was entirely\r\ndependent. At length, in September 1833, he was able to establish\r\nhimself at Naples, where for a time his health and spirits seemed\r\nmarvellously improved; but from the summer of 1836 these retrograded,\r\nand he succumbed to a sudden aggravation of the dropsy which had long\r\nthreatened him, on June 14, 1837. His unpublished philological writings\r\nwere bequeathed to a Swiss friend, Professor de Sinner, who neglected\r\nhis trust. The MSS., however, were bought from his heirs by the Italian\r\nGovernment, and have been partially published. Leopardi’s other works\r\nwere faithfully edited by Antonio Ranieri, a friend whose devoted\r\nkindness to him during his life renders it utterly incomprehensible\r\nhow he should have sought to blacken his memory after his death by\r\nthe publication of a number of painful and humiliating circumstances,\r\nwhich, if they had been facts, should have been consigned to oblivion,\r\nbut which Dr. Franco Ridella has shown to be mere invention.\r\n\r\nWhile he still posed as Leopardi’s Pythias, Ranieri summed up his\r\nfriend’s titles to renown as, “first a great philologer, next a great\r\npoet, at the last a great philosopher.” Great poet he unquestionably\r\nwas; his refined classical scholarship might have earned him the\r\ndistinction of a great philologer in a sense disused since comparative\r\nphilology has taken rank among the exact sciences; if he was a great\r\nphilosopher, so Voltaire and Lucian must be esteemed. The keen\r\nsensibility to pain which dominated his mental constitution was as\r\nlittle associated with any constructive faculty or capacity for\r\nsystematic thought as was their hatred of pretence and perception of\r\nthe ludicrous; but while their endowments were brilliantly serviceable\r\nto mankind, Leopardi’s moral pathology, if it had any potency at all,\r\ncould operate only for ill. Mischievous attempts have indeed been made\r\nto accredit the pessimism of our times by exalting the cries wrung by\r\nanguish from a wretched invalid into the last and ripest fruit of the\r\ntree of knowledge. Whatever may be the case in Oriental countries,\r\nthere has seldom been a pessimist in the West without some moral or\r\nphysical malady which ought to have withheld him from assuming the\r\npart of an instructor of mankind; but Leopardi’s pessimism is not only\r\nmorbid, but unmanly. The stress which he lays upon merely physical\r\nevils, such as heat and cold, hunger and thirst, would have moved\r\nthe contempt of an ancient sage of any sect; and the contemporary of\r\nso many martyrs for their country admits no spring of human action\r\nbut naked egotism. The grandeur and beauty of material nature, the\r\nsublime creations of man’s spirit, the teeming harvest of human virtues\r\nand affections, the tranquillising recognition of eternal order and\r\ncontrolling law, the marvellous course of the world’s history, when\r\nnot ignored, are treated as the mere mockery and aggravation of the\r\nentirely imaginary background of blackness--a shining leprosy upon\r\na hideous countenance. And yet the real nature of the man was quite\r\ndifferent; his pessimism and egotism are simply the product of bodily\r\nsuffering, of the wounded self-esteem and disappointed affections\r\nwhich followed in its train, and of the absence of any outlet for his\r\nsurpassing intellectual powers.\r\n\r\nIt was a cruel injury to Italy that her greatest modern genius should\r\nhave done so little for her regeneration, and that his writings,\r\ninstead of inspiring a healthy public spirit, should rather tend to\r\nfoster the selfish indifference and the despair of good which continue\r\nto be her principal bane. In two points of view, nevertheless, Leopardi\r\nrendered his country essential service. His sufferings, and the moral\r\ninfirmities which they entailed, enabled him to represent in his own\r\nperson, as no soundly-constituted man could have done, the unhappy\r\nItaly of his day. He seemed the living symbol of a country naturally\r\nfavoured beyond all others, but racked and dismembered by foreign and\r\ndomestic tyrants, the counterparts in the body politic of the maladies\r\nwhich crippled Leopardi’s energies, and distorted his views of man and\r\nnature. At the same time the transcendent excellence of his scanty\r\nliterary performances raised Italian literature to a height which,\r\nAlfieri and Monti notwithstanding, it had not attained since Tasso, and\r\nin the midst of an epoch of servitude and subjugation gave Italians at\r\nleast one thing of which they might justly be proud.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of Leopardi’s writings, indeed, is diminutive, and the\r\nrange of his ideas narrow; but within these limits he has approached\r\nabsolute perfection more closely, not only than any other Italian, but\r\nthan any modern writer. He is one of that small and remarkable class\r\nof men who have arisen here and there in recent Europe to reproduce\r\neach some peculiar aspect of the ancient Greek genius. As Shelley is a\r\nGreek by his pantheism, Keats by his feeling for nature, Platen by the\r\narchitectonic of his verse, so is Leopardi by his impeccability. All\r\nthe best Greek productions, whether of poetic or of plastic art, have\r\nthis character of inevitableness: they can neither be better nor other\r\nthan they are. It is not the same in romantic poetry. Shakespeare no\r\ndoubt always chose the best path, but he always seems to have had the\r\nchoice among a thousand. In almost everything of Leopardi’s, whether\r\nverse or prose, form and thought appear indissolubly interfused without\r\nthe possibility of disjunction. This is eminently the case with his\r\npoems, perfect examples of lofty and sustained eloquence entirely\r\nuncontaminated by rhetoric. There are few thoughts which strike by\r\ntheir novelty, few elaborated similes, few phrases which stand forth\r\nin isolation from the environing text. All seems of a piece; but the\r\nwords chosen are invariably the most apt to express the idea sought\r\nto be conveyed, and the stream of sentiment is as pellucid as it is\r\nimpetuous. The same mastery is evinced in the descriptive passages,\r\nwhich never appear to exist for their own sakes, but as depicting\r\nthe inner feeling of the poem by a visible symbol. Be the subject\r\nsmall or great, from the disappearance of a vast landscape at the\r\nsetting of the moon, or the terrified peasant listening sleeplessly\r\nto the roar of Vesuvius, down to the rain pattering at the poet’s\r\nwindow, or the rattle of the carriage resuming its journey after the\r\nstorm, these descriptions impress by their perfect adequacy and their\r\ncomplete fusion of speech and thought, and it can only be objected\r\nto them that they are finer than the moralities they usher in. So\r\nwrote the Greeks, and the recovery of an apparently lost type makes\r\namends for the monotony of Leopardi’s dismal message to mankind and\r\nthe extreme limitation of his range of thought. In his later days his\r\nhorizon seemed to expand; his serio-comic _Paralipomeni_, already\r\nnoticed with other examples of its class, displays an unexpected\r\nversatility, and his last ode, _La Ginestra_, inspired by the hardy\r\nand humble broom-plant flourishing on the brink of the lava-fields of\r\nVesuvius, is more original in conception and ampler in sweep than any\r\nof its predecessors. It somewhat resembles Shelley’s _Mont Blanc_;\r\nas Shelley’s _Triumph of Life_, with equal unconsciousness on the\r\nauthor’s part, approximates to Leopardi’s first important poem, the\r\n_Appressamento alla Morte_. They had here a common model in Petrarch.\r\n\r\nLeopardi’s poems, though the majority are in blank verse, may\r\ngenerally be defined as canzoni, either odes in the strict sense of the\r\nterm, addresses to friends, impassioned outpourings of lonely thought\r\nakin to Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey,” or apostrophes to inanimate\r\nobjects, such as the moon, the natural friend of the melancholy poet,\r\nor the Vesuvian broom-plant, already mentioned. A few pieces, such as\r\n_Il Primo Amore_, _Il Risorgimento_, are autobiographical; in these\r\nLeopardi usually adopts _terza rima_ or the ordinary rhymed metres.\r\nPersonal as these pieces are in subject, they are not really more\r\nsubjective than the rest. Leopardi is entirely devoid of inventive\r\npower: the wandering shepherd of Asia, mouthpiece for one of his\r\nfinest poems, is the author in everything but costume. Three of the\r\nmost celebrated odes, _To Italy_, _On the Florentine Monument to\r\nDante_, and _To Angelo Mai on the Recovery of Cicero De Republica_,\r\nmay be styled patriotic; but although the love of Italy is clearly and\r\neloquently expressed, the scorn of her actual condition, the fault of\r\nno one then breathing, is so bitter and contumelious that the effect\r\nis anything but Tyrtæan. These are nevertheless masterpieces of noble\r\ndiction, and little short of miraculous for the age of twenty, at which\r\nthey were produced. It is perhaps a defect that lines are frequently\r\nleft unrhymed, and that the ear is thus defrauded of an anticipated\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nLeopardi’s blank verse is the finest in Italian literature. If it has\r\nneither the “wood-note wild” of Shakespeare’s sweetest passages, nor\r\nthe voluminous harmony of Milton’s organ-music, nor the dainty artifice\r\nof Tennyson, it is fully on a par with the finest metrical performances\r\nof Shelley and Coleridge; and perhaps the English reader could hardly\r\nobtain a better idea of it than by imagining a blending of the manner\r\nof Coleridge’s idylls with that of Shelley’s _Alastor_. It admits of\r\ntranslation into English; while an adequate rendering of the strictly\r\nlyrical poems, so smooth and yet so muscular, like the marble statue of\r\nan athlete, would be an achievement of very great difficulty. Perhaps\r\nthe following little piece may convey some idea of Leopardi’s manner in\r\nblank verse. Few are the poems in which a mere triviality has been made\r\nthe occasion of a meditation so sublime:\r\n\r\n      _Dear to me ever was this lonely hill,\r\n      And this low hedge, whose potent littleness\r\n      Forbids the vast horizon to the eye.\r\n      For, as I sit and muse, my fancy frames\r\n      Interminable space beyond its bound,\r\n      And silence more than human, and secure\r\n      Unutterable and unending rest,\r\n      Where even the heart hath peace. And as I hear\r\n      The faint wind’s breath among the trees, my mind\r\n      Compares these lispings with the infinite hush\r\n      Of that invisible distance, and the dead\r\n      And unborn hours of dim eternity\r\n      With this hour and its voices. Thus my thought\r\n      Gulfing infinity doth swallow up;\r\n      And sweet to me is shipwreck in this sea._\r\n\r\nLeopardi’s prose works, his correspondence and philological essays\r\nexcepted, are, like his poetry, limited in extent and in range of\r\nsubject, but incomparable for refinement and beauty of form. He deemed\r\na perfect prose more beautiful and more difficult of achievement than\r\npoetry of like rank, and related to it as the undraped figure to the\r\nfigure clothed. The most remarkable of his prose writings are the\r\nDialogues, which almost all turn upon the everlasting theme of the\r\nmisery of mankind, varied in the exposition with a grace and fanciful\r\ningenuity recalling the little apologues in Turgenev’s _Senilia_. In\r\none, Mercury and Atlas play at ball with the earth, become light as\r\ntinder by internal decay and the extinction of life; in another, the\r\nearth and the moon compare notes on the infelicity of their respective\r\ninhabitants; in another, Momus and Prometheus descend to earth to\r\ninvestigate the success of the latter’s philanthropic inventions, which\r\nhave answered Momus’s expectations better than his; in another, Tasso’s\r\nfamiliar genius promises to make him happy in the only possible manner,\r\nby a pleasing dream. Comparison is continually suggested with two\r\ngreat writers, Lucian and Pascal, and Leopardi sustains it worthily.\r\nInferior to Lucian in racy humour, to Pascal in keenness of sarcasm,\r\nhe surpasses both in virtue of the poetical endowment which nature had\r\nutterly denied to them. In form he comes nearest to Lucian, in spirit\r\nto Pascal. Lucian, a healthy four-square man, robust in common-sense,\r\nlittle given to introspection and untroubled by sensitiveness, is\r\nconstitutionally very unlike Leopardi; but it might be difficult to\r\nestablish a closer parallel than between the Italian and the French\r\nrecluse; both very sparing but very choice writers; exquisite scholars\r\nin classics and mathematics respectively; both hopeless pessimists\r\nbecause hopeless invalids; the keenest and most polished intellects of\r\ntheir time, and yet further astray on the most momentous subjects than\r\nmany a man “whose talk is of bullocks.” Leopardi has the advantage in\r\nso far that his scorn of man never degenerates into misanthropy, and\r\nhis negation is better than Pascal’s superstition.\r\n\r\nLeopardi’s strictly ethical writings (_Storia del Genere Umano_;\r\n_Parini_, or _On Glory_; _Bruto Minore_; _Filippo Ottonieri_) are\r\nnecessarily devoid of imaginative form, and hence want the peculiar\r\ncharm of his Dialogues, but are not inferior in classical finish.\r\nThey bring out a more serious defect of his thought than even his\r\npessimism--his ultra-hedonism in definition of happiness as a\r\nsuccession of momentary pleasurable emotions, each to be enjoyed as\r\nsomething complete in itself without reference to antecedents or\r\nconsequences. This theory, said to have originated with Aristippus of\r\nCyrene, is precisely that put forth by Walter Pater at the beginning\r\nof his career, but afterwards virtually retracted. There is one human\r\ncondition, and but one, which it actually does suit, and that is\r\nLeopardi’s own--the condition of the chronic invalid. To the sufferer\r\nwhose life is a continual physical agony, the brief intervals of ease\r\nactually are the utmost bliss he is capable of conceiving, and he may\r\nwell be forgiven if he makes a succession of such thrills of pleasure\r\nthe ideal of life. From any other point of view this hedonism is the\r\ndoctrine of a voluptuary, which Leopardi assuredly was not. His mode\r\nof thought, nevertheless, increased his infelicity by depriving him\r\nof solace from the anticipation of posthumous fame, for which, as\r\nno ingenuity could prove it a pleasurable sensation, his hedonistic\r\nmaterialism left no place. With his low estimate of men, he could\r\nrepose little hope in their justice; nor, though perfectly aware of\r\nthe supreme literary excellence of his own writings, could he feel\r\nthe assurance of their immortality which is only possible to him who\r\nregards the universe as incarnate Reason. His verdict upon himself and\r\nthem, widely at variance with the truth, but logical from his own point\r\nof view, is pathetically summed up in his epitaph on the imaginary\r\nFilippo Ottonieri, his own ideal portrait: “_Here lies Filippo\r\nOttonieri, born for renown and virtuous deeds; who lived without profit\r\nand died without fame; ignorant neither of his nature nor of his\r\nfortune._”\r\n\r\nMany of Leopardi’s detached meditations and aphorisms evince great\r\nsubtlety and accuracy of observation, distorted by his persistent\r\ndetermination to think ill of the human race as a whole, while amicably\r\nand often affectionately disposed towards its individual members. His\r\nphilological writings are those of an accomplished scholar, but their\r\nthemes are generally of minor importance. His letters are frequently\r\nmost pathetic in their references to his wretched situation, which\r\nalone can excuse the frequent insincerity of those addressed to his\r\nfather. On the whole, his faults and his virtues are such as to render\r\nhim the most lively representation of the Italy of his day, superior to\r\nthe Italy of a past age in so far as awakened to a consciousness of her\r\nabject condition, but not yet nerved to struggle for her redemption.\r\n\r\nWhile Leopardi, although at heart a patriot, was virtually proclaiming\r\npatriotism a phantom, a poet of a very different cast was assailing\r\nabuses and preparing a better day by dint of humorous indignation and\r\nsturdy hopefulness. The Italy of the time stands between Leopardi\r\nand GIUSEPPE GIUSTI (1809-50) like Garrick between tragedy and\r\ncomedy. Giusti’s gifts were less sublime than Leopardi’s, but not\r\nless original. What Leopardi was to the Italian language in its most\r\nclassical form, Giusti was to the peculiar niceties of the most\r\nidiomatic Tuscan. What Leopardi was to the most elevated description\r\nof poetry, Giusti was to political satire. Indeed he was more, for\r\nLeopardi merely carried recognised form to more consummate perfection,\r\nwhile Giusti’s style was actually created by him. Rich as Italy had\r\nbeen in most kinds of humorous and burlesque poetry, she had achieved\r\nlittle in political satire for very evident reasons. Campanella\r\nand Alfieri had verged upon it; and Casti’s _Animali Parlanti_ and\r\nLeopardi’s _Paralipomeni_ may, from one point of view, be regarded as\r\npolitical satires, though rather belonging to the mock-heroic epic.\r\nBut no political satirist had yet reached the heart of the people,\r\npartly because few had the courage to make the attempt, partly because\r\nmetrical satire was as yet restricted to refined and artificial forms.\r\nThe gallantry with which Giusti, living under the absolute government\r\nof Tuscany, itself wholly subservient to Austria, launched shaft\r\nafter shaft against the oppressors of his country, is paralleled by\r\nthe boldness of the literary innovation he made in discarding the\r\ntime-honoured forms of blank verse and _terza rima_, and conveying\r\nsatire in easy and familiar lyric.\r\n\r\nGiusti has been compared to Béranger, but certainly falls short of the\r\nFrenchman as a master of song, while he has more of the sacred fire\r\nof poetical indignation. The Anacreontic side of Béranger’s genius\r\nhas no counterpart in him. As a master of idiomatic Tuscan he stands\r\nalone; but his poems require a glossary, and what helps his fame with\r\nhis countrymen hinders it with foreigners. His satires are sometimes\r\ncalled forth by the occurrences of the day, but are more frequently\r\ndirected at some persistent evil or misfortune of the country; and\r\nalthough the expulsion of the foreigner and his vassals is the idea\r\nmost commonly in the background, not a few of the best pieces treat of\r\nthe defects of the Italian people itself, the frivolity of some classes\r\nof society, the ignorance and superstition of others, and not least the\r\npretentious emptiness of much modern liberalism. The general tone of\r\nGiusti’s compositions is easy and humorous; but under the impulse of\r\nemotion he is capable of rising into high poetry, as in the description\r\nof the corruption of Florentine society in his _Gingillino_, or in the\r\npalinode to the Grand Duke of Tuscany, when (October 1847) the poet for\r\na moment believed that Leopold was about to pursue a liberal course.\r\n\r\nGiusti would have found it difficult to reconcile this attitude\r\nwith the aspirations for the unity of Italy which he had expressed\r\nin his _Stivale_ in 1836, but it soon appeared that Leopold’s\r\nconstitutionalism was of a piece with the monastic inclinations\r\nattributed to invalid devils, and Giusti went back into opposition,\r\nmore annoyed and dispirited by the follies and vagaries of his own\r\nparty than by the iniquities of the enemy. The French Revolution\r\nof February 1848 gave the upper hand to the Tuscan liberals, who\r\nhad superabundantly manifested their incapacity ere, in March 1849,\r\nthe fate of Tuscany was decided on the battlefield of Novara. The\r\nheart-broken poet, already suffering from grievous illness, could\r\nnot survive until the better day, dying on 31st March 1850. _Chi\r\ndura vince._ His profession had been that of an advocate, and, until\r\nhis last days, his life was uneventful except for an unfortunate\r\nattachment. It certainly speaks for the lenity of the Tuscan Government\r\nthat he should not have spent much of it in prison, for his satires\r\nfrom 1833 to 1847 circulated widely in manuscript, and some were\r\nprinted in Switzerland in his lifetime. They must suffer with posterity\r\nfor their general relation to temporary circumstances; but Giusti will\r\never retain the honour of having been the first to apply ordinary\r\nItalian speech to the poetical expression of new ideas and new needs,\r\nthus enlarging the domain both of language and of literature.\r\n\r\nThe best English translations from Giusti are the brilliant renderings\r\nby Mr. W. D. Howells, especially that of the striking poem of _St.\r\nAmbrose_, where an Italian is represented as moved to sympathy with the\r\nAustrian soldiers by the beauty of\r\n\r\n      _A German anthem that to heaven went\r\n        On unseen wings, up from the holy fane;\r\n      It was a prayer, and seemed like a lament,\r\n        Of such a pensive, grave, pathetic strain,\r\n      That in my soul it never shall be spent;\r\n        And how such heavenly harmony in the brain\r\n      Of those thick-skulled barbarians should dwell,\r\n      I must confess it passes me to tell._\r\n\r\n      _In that sad hymn I felt the bitter sweet\r\n        Of the songs heard in childhood, which the soul\r\n      Learns from beloved voices, to repeat\r\n        To its own anguish in the days of dole:\r\n      A thought of the dear mother, a regret,\r\n        A longing for repose and love--the whole\r\n      Anguish of distant exile seemed to run\r\n      Over my heart and leave it all undone._\r\n\r\n      _When the strain ceased, it left me pondering\r\n        Tenderer thoughts, and stronger and more clear;\r\n      These men, I mused, the self-same despot king\r\n        Who rules on Slavic and Italian fear,\r\n      Tears from their homes and arms that round them cling,\r\n        And drives them slaves thence, to keep as slaves here;\r\n      From their familiar fields afar they pass,\r\n      Like herds to winter in some strange morass._\r\n\r\n      _Poor souls! far off from all that they hold dear,\r\n        And in a land that hates them! Who shall say\r\n      That at the bottom of their hearts they bear\r\n        Love for our tyrant? I should like to lay\r\n      They’ve our hate for him in their pockets! Here,\r\n        But that I turned in haste and broke away,\r\n      I should have kissed a corporal, stiff and tall,\r\n      And like a scarecrow stuck against the wall._\r\n\r\nAffinities with Browning may be observed in these stanzas, and Browning\r\nmeets Giusti half-way in _Up at a Villa--Down in the City_.\r\n\r\nAnother popular poet claims a high and exceptional place in Italian\r\nletters, not so much from his poetical gift as from his vivid and\r\nuncompromising realism. The peculiar domain of GIOACCHINO BELLI\r\n(1791-1863) is the populace of Rome, whose humours, joys, and tragedies\r\nhe has made his own. He has indeed competitors, but, as his editor\r\nMorandi observes, these are but as rivers to the sea in comparison with\r\nthe fabulous opulence of Belli, who has depicted the life around him in\r\nmore than two thousand sonnets, each in its way a little masterpiece.\r\nAlmost all represent some scene in the life of the people, observed\r\nin his daily ramble, and versified upon his return home. For spirit\r\nand truth to nature most of them are almost comparable to Theocritus’s\r\nportrait of Praxinoe, and there is probably not another instance in the\r\nworld of the life of a great city so perfectly delineated in verse,\r\nor of such an enormous collection of sonnets of so high an average of\r\nmerit. The drawback to their general enjoyment is their inevitable\r\ncomposition in the Roman dialect, lively, coloured, and full of comic\r\nphrases, but uncouth and corrupt. Another important division of Belli’s\r\nwork is the political sonnet, full of mordant satire on the abuses of\r\nthe Papal government under Gregory XVI., not the less veracious because\r\nthe author wished to recall it when the Catholic in him ultimately\r\novercame the Liberal.\r\n\r\nThe patriotic work of Giusti and of Belli was thus in a measure\r\nlocal; one took charge of Tuscany, and the other of Rome. Another\r\ndistinguished man took all Italy (the impossible kingdom of the Two\r\nSicilies excepted) for his province, and deserves to be enumerated\r\namong the more eminent Italian writers of the nineteenth century who\r\nhave powerfully contributed to the regeneration of their country.\r\nPIETRO GIORDANI (1774-1848) is nevertheless not a great author, and\r\nperhaps his highly interesting correspondence is the only portion of\r\nhis writings which will retain a permanent value. But he was almost\r\nthe mainspring of the literary movement of his time. Italian authors\r\nresorted to him for ideas, as English authors resorted to Samuel Rogers\r\nfor breakfasts, and neither went empty away. But for him Leopardi might\r\nhave wasted his life on classical philology and verbal criticism; he\r\nhelped Manzoni and Giusti to their fame; he lived familiarly with\r\nNiccolini, Capponi, and Colletta, and was the intimate friend of\r\nMonti and Canova. The first forty years of his life, spent in various\r\nofficial employments, had been troubled and needy, but he ultimately\r\ninherited a fortune, and during the Thirty Years’ Peace his activity\r\nincessantly pervaded Italian letters like an unseen sap, save when he\r\ncame forward to promote a savings-bank or an infant-school, or got\r\nhimself expelled from the territories of some petty prince. His style\r\nis highly finished and polished, but is the chief recommendation of his\r\nwritings, the epistolary excepted.\r\n\r\nFinally, among the more distinguished authors of the period who\r\nsystematically laboured for the deliverance and regeneration of their\r\ncountry must be named two most illustrious men, both called upon to\r\ndeal with practical affairs, yet chiefly efficacious through their\r\nwritings, VINCENZO GIOBERTI and GIUSEPPE MAZZINI. Both were subjects of\r\nthe King of Sardinia--Gioberti a royal chaplain at Turin; Mazzini a man\r\nof letters at Genoa writing essays in defence of the romantic school.\r\nBoth were incarcerated and banished--Gioberti through the animosity of\r\nthe Jesuits, Mazzini as a Carbonaro. Gioberti betook himself to France,\r\nMazzini to England. Gioberti soon obtained an European reputation by\r\nhis philosophical writings, but does not appear to have materially\r\ninfluenced French opinion in favour of his country. Mazzini, on the\r\nother hand, produced great effects by his mission to England, where the\r\n“swift, yet still, Ligurian figure; merciful and fierce; true as steel,\r\nthe word and thought of him limpid as water” (Carlyle),[22] fascinated\r\nthe best men and women, and made the emancipation of Italy a cause\r\ndear to the heart of the people. On the other hand, he misused the\r\nliberality of his friends by promoting a number of petty revolts and\r\nfoolish expeditions which commonly ended in the destruction of all who\r\nparticipated in them.\r\n\r\nGioberti accomplished infinitely more for the national cause by his\r\ngreat book, _Il Primato d’Italia_ (1845), which dissuaded Italy from\r\nabortive conspiracies, and preached spiritual as a preparation for\r\npolitical unity. It also, by its own merits and the reputation which\r\nthe author had already gained as a thinker, compelled men of intellect\r\nto look into her case. Unfortunately, Gioberti had not grasped the\r\nnecessity of absolute administrative concentration, and advocated\r\nconfederacy among the various Italian states; an idea irreconcilable\r\nwith that of unity, and moreover utterly impracticable on account of\r\nthe centrifugalism of the sovereigns concerned. This made it possible\r\nfor Gioberti, when at length he had himself become minister at Turin,\r\nto propose that Piedmont should anticipate the inevitable restoration\r\nof the sovereigns of Central Italy by Austria or France by restoring\r\nthem herself; a step which would have ruined the house of Savoy in\r\npublic opinion, and consequently have destroyed all hope of an united\r\nItaly. Gioberti soon retired to Paris, where he died suddenly in 1852,\r\njust as a new chapter of events was opening, in which, taught by\r\nexperience, he would probably have performed a more efficient part.\r\n\r\nIt would have been well for the political, though not the literary\r\nreputation of Mazzini if he had died about the same time in the good\r\nodour of the courage and capacity he had shown in the defence of Rome\r\nagainst the French. Although he had a great advantage over Gioberti\r\nin his perception of the need of national unity, he was unable to\r\nconceive of this otherwise than under Republican forms. He was hence\r\nalmost as ready to thwart the Piedmontese as to expel the Austrian;\r\nhe opposed every practical scheme for the redemption of Italy, from\r\nthe Crimean expedition downwards; and his public career down to his\r\ndeath in 1872 is a series of lamentable mistakes. He could not see\r\nthat his mission was performed when he had once breathed life into the\r\ndry bones, and he had no appreciation of the practical genius of a man\r\nlike Cavour, fully as indispensable to the common cause as his own\r\nideal enthusiasm. Happily there was another and more extensive field\r\nin which this enthusiasm was perfectly in place. Mazzini was much more\r\nthan a conspirator, more even than a patriot. As a man of letters,\r\nhe concerned himself with German, English, and Slavonic literature,\r\nand opened up new horizons to Italian thought. Polish literature was\r\nespecially congenial to him, for at that period its inspiration came\r\nfrom worlds beyond mortal ken, and Mazzini, recoiling from the prosaic\r\ncommon-sense of the eighteenth century, possessed the vein of mysticism\r\ncommon to contemporaries otherwise so dissimilar as Lamennais, Balzac,\r\nGeorge Sand, Newman, Mickiewicz. This gave a singular elevation to his\r\nethical thought. A severe thinker, he meditated much on human rights\r\nand human duties, and assigned precedence to the latter. “Think less\r\nof your rights and more of your duties” is the burden of much ethical\r\nadmonition addressed, especially during his later years, to the\r\nworking classes, and containing some of the noblest and most dignified\r\nteaching to be found in the world. Mazzini had little sympathy with\r\nsome of the more recent developments of democracy; his life had been\r\none of disinterested privation for great ends, and he thought little,\r\nperhaps too little, of merely material ameliorations. His mysticism,\r\nhis austere magnanimity, and his deeply religious feeling find their\r\nmost perfect expression in his noble epistle to the members of the\r\nŒcumenical Council of 1869, which, along with President Lincoln’s\r\noration on the battlefield of Gettysburg, crowns the public eloquence\r\nof our time; nor needs the age which has produced two such deliverances\r\nto envy in this respect the age of Pericles.\r\n\r\nTime has worked and is working for Mazzini; the fanaticism and unreason\r\nof one side of his character, having produced no permanent ill effect,\r\nfall more and more into oblivion, or are recognised as the necessary\r\nconditions of his unique gifts. His failings were the failings of\r\na prophet: little as he was qualified to guide the movement he had\r\nevoked, none but such an one as he could have brought about the\r\nnational resurrection truly described by Mr. Swinburne in the poem\r\nwhere he as truly hails in Mazzini the third Italian prophet after\r\nDante and Michael Angelo:\r\n\r\n      _And the third prophet standing by her grave,\r\n        Stretched forth his hand and touched her, and her eyes\r\n        Opened as sudden suns in heaven might rise,\r\n      And her soul caught from his the faith to save:\r\n      Faith above creeds, faith beyond records, born\r\n      Of the pure, naked, fruitful, awful morn._\r\n\r\nThere is an ancient story of a princess carried off by a dragon and\r\nconfined on a desert island in the most remote recesses of the ocean,\r\nwho owed her deliverance to the joint exertions of three most eminent\r\nbrothers, none of whom could have accomplished anything without the\r\nother two. One, an astrologer, discovered the place of her captivity;\r\nthe second, a mechanician, made a winged horse; upon which the third, a\r\nsoldier, proceeded to the spot and slew the dragon. In the liberation\r\nof Italy the part of the astrologer fell to Mazzini, that of the\r\nmechanician to Cavour, and that of the soldier to Garibaldi.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] There is a lively portrait of him in Ruffini’s _Lorenzo Benoni_,\r\nwhere he is introduced as “Fantasio.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n                 THE NINETEENTH CENTURY--MIDDLE PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\nLiterature, as a rule, must ever be on the side of liberty, for one\r\nconclusive reason among others--that liberty is the life of literature.\r\nHence every man of letters is instinctively a partisan of freedom; and\r\neven should his political or religious opinions drive him to support\r\na tyranny by which these are protected, or should he be willing to\r\nacquiesce in a despotism which maintains peace and encourages art, he\r\nmust yet disapprove of restraint upon his own productiveness, and this\r\ninevitable concession implies all the rest. Poetry--and the remark may\r\nin its measure be extended to every department of intellectual labour\r\nimplying creation or even construction--has been well said to represent\r\nthe best and happiest moments of the best and happiest minds, a virtue\r\nand felicity to be understood as referring solely to the intellectual\r\nsphere. That is, there is no activity so pleasurable as production, or,\r\nby consequence, anything so intolerable as restraint.\r\n\r\nThe history of European literature for the half-century following the\r\nfall of Napoleon is, therefore, in the main, that of a force enlisted\r\nto contend with the Governments and the various sinister interests\r\nwhich strove to ignore the Revolution and restore the state of\r\naffairs which had existed in the eighteenth century. Many illustrious\r\nauthors, no doubt, especially in England, more or less favoured this\r\ntendency, but their literary practice was commonly inconsistent with\r\ntheir political principles. Scott, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey,\r\nChateaubriand, might be reactionary as politicians, but in the literary\r\nsphere they were innovators and iconoclasts. The study of their\r\nwritings could not but engender a habit of mind entirely inconsistent\r\nwith the deference to authority required for the perpetuation of the\r\nancient régime in State and Church. No man, for example, more sincerely\r\ndeplored the tendencies of his times than Niebuhr, but he should have\r\nthought of them before he meddled with the history of Rome. By proving\r\nits legendary character, he had done more to unsettle allegiance to\r\ntradition than could have been accomplished by the wit and malice of a\r\nhundred Heines. We are thus justified in regarding the literature of\r\nthe nineteenth century as in the main a great liberating force, and in\r\nthe long-run favourable to sound conservatism also, since it aimed at\r\nprocuring that liberty for the human spirit without which renovation\r\nwas as impossible as demolition.\r\n\r\nIf there was any country in Europe where literature might be expected\r\nto be unequivocally on the side of Liberty, it was Italy; for Italy\r\nalone had to reckon with foreign as well as domestic oppressors. In\r\nfact, the general tendency of Italian literature during the period\r\nunder review is more uniformly liberal than that of any other; but\r\nat the same time its expression is more restrained than that of any\r\nother, for the conclusive reason that an Italian writer could only\r\nobtain liberty of speech at the price of exile. Love of country is,\r\nnevertheless, the dominant thought, which colours it throughout as the\r\nsoil colours the flower. The men of greatest genius and most prominent\r\nassociation with the national movement have been treated of in previous\r\nchapters, but the host of distinguished if less illustrious authors who\r\nmust be briefly reviewed in this, was not less animated with patriotic\r\nfeeling, and this pervading spirit imparts to the Italian literature of\r\nthe period unity and dignity, and entitles it to a higher place in the\r\ngeneral history of literature than could have been procured for it by\r\nthe mere ability of its representatives.\r\n\r\nOne apparent exception to this generally liberal and patriotic tendency\r\nis not really an exception. The New Catholic reaction which was a\r\nnecessary consequence of the Revolution, whatever it may have been\r\namong the priesthood and the less cultivated classes, was neither\r\nilliberal nor unpatriotic among men of letters. Many of the most\r\neminent of these were fervent Catholics, and as such felt themselves in\r\na strait between the claims of religion and of country. As the head of\r\nthe Church, the Pope was entitled to the profoundest veneration, but\r\nas temporal prince, he was as much supported by Austrian bayonets as\r\nany of the rest. Could he be promoted from this undignified position to\r\nthat of spiritual King of Italy by the union of all Italian states into\r\na confederacy under his auspices? This project, if Utopian, was yet\r\nnatural, generous, and in no respect inconsistent with true patriotic\r\nfeeling. It broke down from the demonstration furnished by the course\r\nof events of the incompatibility of Italian confederacy with Italian\r\nunity, but, by the exertions of its opponents, no less than those of\r\nits supporters, it left deep traces upon literature.\r\n\r\nThis idea was the especial property of Vincenzo Gioberti, already\r\nmentioned among the men to whom Italian regeneration owes most.\r\nIts very fallacy was a powerful aid to the popular cause, for it\r\nconciliated many who would have shrunk from openly assailing the\r\nPope’s secular authority, while at the same time it was not so\r\nobviously unsound as to be incapable of being maintained in good\r\nfaith until refuted by the course of events. Although, nevertheless,\r\nGioberti’s essay on Italy’s spiritual and intellectual primacy is\r\nthe most important of his works, it almost disappears in the mass of\r\nthe remainder, treating for the most part of religion, or of moral\r\nor speculative philosophy. Among them was a violent attack on the\r\nwritings of the most eminent Italian philosopher of the age, ANTONIO\r\nROSMINI-SERBATI (1797-1855), who in turn accused Gioberti of pantheism.\r\nThe great purpose of Rosmini’s philosophy may be defined to be the\r\nperfecting of St. Thomas Aquinas’s system by expelling the element\r\nit had derived from Aristotle, which in Rosmini’s view led direct to\r\npantheism and materialism. He laboured hard at this object all his\r\nlife, but died before his work was done. It says much for his genius\r\nthat one so encumbered with childish ultramontane notions should have\r\nwon the acknowledged rank he holds among the first philosophical\r\nthinkers. He is equally well known as the founder of a religious Order,\r\nthe constant antagonist of the Jesuits, and the author of the _Five\r\nWounds of the Church_, an appeal for reform whose honest frankness was\r\nused by his enemies to deprive him of the cardinal’s hat that had been\r\npromised him. His Order still flourishes, his system is still potent,\r\nand his memory, honoured everywhere, is almost adored in his native\r\nplace, Roveredo in the Italian Tyrol.\r\n\r\nAnother philosopher influential on Italian thought was GIOVANNI\r\nDOMENICO ROMAGNOSI (1761-1835), whose importance chiefly consists in\r\nhis application of philosophy to legal and political science, and his\r\nclear prevision of the coming deliverance of Italy.\r\n\r\nNo Italian of his age, perhaps, was more thoroughly admirable in every\r\nrespect than TERENZIO MAMIANI (1799-1885), an approved patriot, a\r\nwise statesman, a sound and sober thinker in religion and philosophy,\r\nan elegant poet, and a man excellent in every relation of life. With\r\nmore angularity of character, he would, perhaps, have possessed\r\nmore creative force, and impressed himself more powerfully on the\r\nimagination. The dignified eloquence of his meditative poetry, usually\r\nin blank verse, and of his discourses, political or academical, is\r\noften very impressive, but the form seems more remarkable than the\r\nsubstance. Like most of the best Italians of his day, he spent his\r\nyouth in exile, his prime in office, and his old age in study and\r\ncomposition. A good selection from his voluminous writings has been\r\npublished with a memoir by Giovanni Mestica, the editor of Petrarch.\r\n\r\nA connecting link between the thinkers and the historians is formed\r\nby GIUSEPPE FERRARI (1812-1872). A disciple of Romagnosi, he imported\r\nabstract ideas into his survey of the revolutions of Italy since the\r\ndownfall of the Roman Empire--a very readable if not always a very\r\nconvincing book. Ferrari was also a distinguished publicist, and an\r\nindefatigable pamphleteer in the cause of his country.\r\n\r\nHistory has been extensively cultivated in Italy during the nineteenth\r\ncentury; and although many histories were but popular compendiums, or\r\nmagnified party pamphlets, or mere _mémoires pour servir_, others have\r\ngained for the writers honourable rank among first-class historians.\r\nThe most extensive in scale and imposing in subject are histories by\r\nCARLO BOTTA (1766-1837) of the American War of Independence and of\r\nItaly from 1789 to 1814. The former is the best history of the subject\r\nout of the United States; the latter, though taxed with partiality,\r\nis a great and invaluable work. His continuation of Guicciardini\r\nis of less account. Botta’s style is severe and dignified; too\r\narchaic in diction, and occasionally deficient in flexibility, but\r\nhe always writes with the consciousness of his mission which becomes\r\nthe historian. He was a determined enemy of the romantic school. A\r\nPiedmontese by birth, he had been concerned in the disturbances of\r\nthe early revolutionary period, and had made several campaigns in the\r\ncapacity of an army surgeon. Become temporarily a Frenchman by the\r\nannexation of Piedmont to France, he had held office under Napoleon,\r\nwhom he displeased by his frankness. After Napoleon’s fall he lived\r\nchiefly in France. Though always a patriot as regarded the independence\r\nof Italy, the melancholy deceptions of revolutionary times led him at\r\nlast to deem his countrymen only fit for an enlightened despotism.\r\n\r\nA stancher liberal was PIETRO COLLETTA (1770-1831) and an even more\r\neminent historian. A Neapolitan officer of engineers, he served under\r\nMurat, but was, nevertheless, maintained in his rank by the restored\r\nBourbons. He was Minister of War under the Constitutional Government of\r\n1820, and after its overthrow was for some time imprisoned at Brunn in\r\nAustria, where his health suffered greatly. Upon his release he settled\r\nat Florence, and devoted himself to writing the history of Naples from\r\nthe accession of the Bourbon dynasty in 1734 up to 1825. He was wholly\r\ninexperienced as an author, but succeeded in imparting classic form to\r\nhis work by dint of infinite labour and careful imitation of Tacitus,\r\nfor which the imperious brevity natural to him, intensified by the\r\nhabits of military life, admirably qualified him. His work is one of\r\nthe most marrowy and sinewy of histories, and is especially valuable\r\nwhere he speaks as an eye-witness. It deals fully with financial and\r\neconomical as well as political and military affairs.\r\n\r\nAnother excellent historian has been almost lost to Italy by the\r\ncircumstances attending the publication of his book. GIOVANNI BATTISTA\r\nTESTA, an exile in England, published in 1853 his history of the\r\nLombard League, at Doncaster, a place better affected to the horse\r\nof Neptune than to the olive of Pallas, and, thus producing _invita\r\nMinerva_, has been almost ignored. In fact, he is an admirable\r\nhistorian, lucid and delightful in his narrative, and his style is\r\nso fashioned upon the purest models, that he might seem to have come\r\nstraight out of the sixteenth century. This might be reprehended as\r\naffectation, but the objection, if in any respect well founded, has\r\nno application to the excellent English version (1877), a book which\r\ncannot be too strongly recommended to historians desirous of acquiring\r\nthe pregnant brevity so essential in this age of multiplication of\r\nbooks to all who would catch and retain the ear of posterity.\r\n\r\nThe friend and biographer of Manzoni, and imitator of his style in a\r\nsuccessful novel, _Margherita Pusterla_, CESARE CANTÙ was a long-lived\r\nand industrious, and consequently a voluminous author. His position\r\nis well marked as almost the only considerable writer of his time who\r\nfavoured political and ecclesiastical reaction, and the resulting\r\nunpopularity has led him to be unjustly depreciated as a man of\r\nletters; he is always interesting, always individual, and his principal\r\nworks, the _History of Italy from 1750 to 1850_ and his _History of\r\nItalian Heretics_, though disfigured by party spirit, are important\r\nbooks. The latter is still the standard authority on the subject,\r\nthough it will hardly be allowed to continue so.\r\n\r\nAn unique position among Italian historians is occupied by MICHELE\r\nAMARI (1805-89), the Orientalist and national historian of Sicily.\r\nDetesting the Neapolitan oppression of his native island, he look up\r\nthe investigation of the Sicilian Vespers, and depicted this great\r\nevent as not the consequence of a conspiracy subtly organised by\r\nJohn of Procida, but as a spontaneous uprising against intolerable\r\noppression. The allusion did not escape the Neapolitan Government,\r\nand Amari found it expedient to withdraw to Paris, where he studied\r\nArabic as a preparation for his yet more important _History of Sicily\r\nunder Moslem Dominion_, published between 1854 and 1872. In the\r\ninterim he had taken part in the Sicilian insurrection, and after the\r\nfinal expulsion of the Bourbons, was successively Minister of Public\r\nInstruction and professor of Arabic at Florence, continuing to write\r\nand edit books on his favourite subjects. No historian has a higher\r\nreputation for erudition and sagacity.\r\n\r\nGIUSEPPE MICALI (1780-1844) devoted himself to a subject even more\r\ndifficult than Amari’s, and one incapable of an authoritative solution\r\nof its numberless problems. His _Storia degli Antichi Popoli Italiani_\r\nis nevertheless a highly important work, which exploded much error, if\r\nit did not establish much truth.\r\n\r\nA Neapolitan, CARLO TROYA (1784-1858) was to have written the History\r\nof Italy in the Middle Ages from 476 to 1321, which by his method\r\nof working might have required forty volumes, but he only arrived\r\nat Charlemagne and only filled sixteen. The book is, as Settembrini\r\nremarks, a thesaurus rather than a history, but cannot be opened\r\nwithout encountering valuable information and judicious criticism.\r\nTroya loved the Middle Age without idolising it; his liberal opinions,\r\nmuch against his will, made the indefatigable bookworm a Minister under\r\none of the ephemeral Neapolitan constitutions, and there was sense as\r\nwell as wit in the reply of the restored Ferdinand when advised to\r\narrest him: “No! leave him in the Middle Ages!”\r\n\r\nThree distinguished statesmen of the nineteenth century, Cesare Balbo,\r\nGino Capponi, and Luigi Carlo Farini, respectively wrote histories of\r\nmuch worth; Balbo an abridged history of Italy, and Capponi one of the\r\nFlorentine republic, while Farini chronicled the transactions of the\r\nStates of the Church from 1814 to 1850. Farini’s is the most important\r\nand authoritative of these works, as he has made the field entirely\r\nhis own. Balbo and Capponi, however, patricians and men of wealth, did\r\neven more for historical studies by their encouragement and pecuniary\r\nassistance than by their own writings. The great Ministers, Cavour,\r\nRicasoli, and Minghetti claim a place in literary history as orators\r\nand pamphleteers.\r\n\r\nFor some reason difficult to understand, biography has not of late\r\nflourished in Italy. No country is so much overrun with little\r\nephemeral memoirs of little ephemeral people, and there are many\r\nextremely valuable studies of particular episodes in the lives of\r\ncelebrated men, of scientific rather than literary merit. The very\r\nimportant works of Villari, Pasolini, and Solerti belong to a later\r\nperiod than that now under review, which possesses only two biographies\r\nof decided literary pretensions, both autobiographic.\r\n\r\nSo important was the public career of MASSIMO D’AZEGLIO (1798-1866),\r\na fervent patriot, but also a prudent statesman, for nobility of\r\ncharacter second to no contemporary, that his memoirs might have\r\nbeen expected to have been very serious. On the contrary, they are\r\neminently lively and gay, in part, perhaps, from their terminating at\r\nthe beginning of 1846, before the author’s heaviest cares had come\r\nupon him. GIUSEPPE MONTANELLI (1813-62), one of the triumvirs in the\r\ninauspicious Tuscan revolution of 1849, though equally honest, was\r\nentirely deficient in the ballast that steadied D’Azeglio. But his\r\nvery levity and inconstancy lend vivacity to his memoirs of the Tuscan\r\naffairs of his time, and the paradoxes of his character, faithfully\r\ndepicted by himself, make a striking and memorable portrait. His style\r\nis unequal, but excellent when at its best.\r\n\r\nNICCOLÓ TOMMASEO, a Dalmatian (1802-74) forms a connecting link\r\nbetween history and _belles-lettres_. With marvellous versatility he\r\nessayed history, politics, moral and speculative philosophy, biography,\r\nphilology, criticism and poetry, distinguishing himself in all without\r\nproducing great or enduring work in any. His greatest distinction,\r\nperhaps, was attained as an Italian grammarian and lexicographer; but\r\nas a critic he wielded great authority, and powerfully contributed\r\nto the development of literature. He was essentially the man of his\r\nown times, and seemed to resume their various aspects in himself, a\r\nsound Catholic and an ardent liberal; a classicist and a romanticist;\r\na conservative and an innovator; impetuous yet moderate in his aims;\r\nfrequently inconsistent with himself, yet ever controlled by an austere\r\nsense of duty; a fine and even brilliant writer, who yet could achieve\r\nno durable work. His account of his exile at Corfu, nevertheless,\r\ndeserves to live for its style, although the theme is insufficient.\r\nTommaseo was a man of marked character, disinterested, independent and\r\nimpracticable; rejecting the public honours which he had well earned\r\nby his share in the defence of Venice, he spent his later years at\r\nFlorence, where, although totally blind, he worked indomitably to\r\nthe last. He should be endeared to England as the author of the fine\r\ninscription placed upon the house of Elizabeth Barrett Browning.\r\n\r\nThe history of Italian poetry during the post-Napoleonic era,\r\nafter deducting the great names of Leopardi and Giusti, is in the\r\nmain the history of the romantic school. It has been remarked that\r\nthis school is not congenial to the Italian genius, and that its\r\ntemporary prevalence could only occur through the decay of the\r\nclassical tradition and the inevitable reaction from the excesses\r\nof the Revolution. It was further prejudiced in Italian eyes by the\r\necclesiastical colouring which it could not help assuming. Most of\r\nthe literary youth of Italy, though they might not be bad Catholics,\r\nwere still better patriots, and although their compositions might be\r\ninfluenced by Scott and Goethe, were utterly averse to the mediæval\r\ndevelopment which the romantic idea was receiving in France and\r\nGermany. This was particularly the case with the first poet of eminence\r\nwho imbibed romantic feeling from Manzoni and broke entirely with the\r\nalready attenuated classicism of Monti and Foscolo. GIOVANNI BERCHET\r\n(1783-1851), although of French descent, was a devoted Italian patriot,\r\nwhose first works of importance were published in London, where he had\r\nbeen obliged to seek refuge. He began by denouncing the conduct of\r\nthe English Government towards the people of Parga, and followed this\r\nup by a succession of stirring ballads, mostly of patriotic tendency,\r\nand a longer poem, _Fantasie_, a vision of the past glories of the\r\nLombard League. In style these poems resemble the romantic poetry of\r\nGermany and England, without a vestige of classical influence, but\r\nalso with no trace of the worship of the past, except as an example to\r\nthe present, or anything of the mystic spirit of genuine romanticism.\r\nWell timed as they were, their effect was extraordinary; but whether\r\nantique or contemporary in subject, they were essentially poems of the\r\nday, and such poetry cannot continue to be read unless it attains the\r\nlevel of Manzoni’s ode on the death of Napoleon and Tennyson’s on the\r\ndeath of Wellington. This Berchet knew. “My aim was not,” he said on\r\none occasion, “to write a fine poem, but to perform a fine action.”\r\nHis style is consequently defective; his poetry was not written to\r\nbe criticised, but to inspire and inflame, and fully answered its\r\npurpose. “He has found,” says Settembrini, “all the maledictions that\r\ncan possibly be hurled against the foreigner.” Upon Charles Albert’s\r\nconversion to the national cause, Berchet returned to Italy, and died a\r\nmember of the Sardinian Parliament, universally honoured and beloved,\r\nnor will his countrymen forget him.\r\n\r\n“Accursed,” adds Settembrini, “be the Italian who forgets GABRIELE\r\nROSSETTI.” Rossetti (1785-1854) assuredly will not be forgotten by\r\nEngland, for which he has done what no other inhabitant of these isles\r\never did in begetting two great poets. His claims to the gratitude of\r\nhis countrymen are of quite another sort, resting chiefly upon the\r\nspirit and fluency of his political poems, which helped to keep the\r\nflame of patriotism alive at home, while the exiled author was teaching\r\nItalian at King’s College. His life is well known as an appendage\r\nto the biography of his more celebrated son. It is one of the most\r\ninteresting speculations imaginable what kind of poetry Dante Gabriel\r\nRossetti would have written if he had been born and brought up in\r\nItaly; certain it is that no prefigurement of his singular alliance\r\nof purity and transparency of feeling with intricacy of thought\r\nand opulence of illustration, or of his objectivity and marvellous\r\npictorial gift, is to be found in his father’s simple, natural, rather\r\noverfluent verse. The elder Rossetti may, nevertheless, be ranked among\r\nthe poets of the romantic school; and a similar place belongs to the\r\namiable Luigi Carrer (1801-53) on account of his ballads, the most\r\nsuccessful of his works. Francesco dall’ Ongaro, a good lyric poet in\r\nother departments, applied the popular _stornello_ to the purposes of\r\npatriotic poetry with eminent success.\r\n\r\nTwo poets of more importance enjoyed for a time great renown,\r\nbut their reputation, without becoming extinct, has considerably\r\ndeclined. GIOVANNI PRATI (1815-54), a native of the Italian Tyrol,\r\ngained great reputation in 1841 by a narrative poem in blank verse,\r\n_Edmenegarda_, founded upon a tragic event in the family of the great\r\nVenetian patriot Daniele Manin. It is a poor apology for adultery, but\r\nin sentimentality, though not in morality, belongs to the school of\r\nLamartine, whose _Jocelyn_ was then at the meridian of its celebrity.\r\nIn consequence, notwithstanding much real poetical merit, it bears\r\nthat fatal impress of the boudoir which disfigures so much of the best\r\npictorial as well as poetical work of the time. Its success encouraged\r\nPrati to produce several volumes of lyrics, spirited, melodious, but\r\ntoo fluent. His facility, like Monti’s, approached the faculty of\r\nimprovisation, but Monti’s tawny torrent has shrunk in Prati into a\r\nsilver rill, equally swift but by no means equally majestic. He is\r\nnevertheless a poet, and in a particular manner the poet of the brief\r\ninterval of hope and joy which accompanied the uprising of 1848. The\r\nnational feeling of the time remains embodied in these verses, the most\r\npermanently valuable of his writings; for the more imaginative and\r\nambitious productions of his later years, such as _Satana e le Grazie_\r\nor _Armando_, though interesting, belong to the fundamentally unsound\r\n_genre_ of adaptation from _Faust_.\r\n\r\nAnother poet once in the enjoyment of a popularity which he has failed\r\nto retain is ALEARDO ALEARDI (1812-78). He has too much elegance and\r\nfeeling to be forgotten, but wants force; his general attitude seems\r\nnot inaccurately indicated in his own description of his heroine\r\nArnalda da Roca as she appeared in the act of blowing up a shipload of\r\nTurks:\r\n\r\n      “Placidamente _fulminò la palla_.”\r\n\r\nThe expression is rarely at the height of the sentiment to be\r\nexpressed. If this can be overlooked, the reader who does not wish his\r\nemotions to run away with him may find much to admire in the languid\r\ngrace of the poems, generally descriptive, didactic or idyllic, which\r\nform the most important part of Aleardi’s work. It is rather a reproach\r\nthan an honour to his patriotic lyrics that their strong point should\r\nbe not eloquence but description, which is always excellent.\r\n\r\nThe reputation of the good priest and good patriot, GIACOMO ZANELLA\r\n(1820-89), has, on the contrary, gone on increasing, and with justice,\r\nfor his verse is usually at the level of his thought, and his thought,\r\nif more frequently graceful than striking, sometimes attains a\r\ncommanding elevation, as in his odes to Dante and on the opening of\r\nthe Suez Canal. His _Psyche_ and _Egoism and Charity_ are clearly and\r\nexquisitely cut as Greek gems. Zanella’s speciality, however, is his\r\neffort to ally science with poetry, and though he cannot always prevail\r\nupon them to shake hands, one of his lyrics of this character, _The\r\nVigil_, a meditation upon Evolution from a theologian’s point of view,\r\nis perhaps his masterpiece. Another very striking poem is the colloquy\r\nbetween Milton and Galileo, in which Galileo’s dread of the sceptical\r\ntendency of the science to which he has imparted such an impulse is\r\nrepresented as determining Milton “to justify the ways of God to man.”\r\nZanella, a native of the Vicenzan district, was a gentle, tender,\r\nmelancholy man, not unlike Cowper, and his reason, under the stress of\r\ndomestic affliction, at one time seemed in danger of suffering the same\r\neclipse. Recovering, he forsook the career of college professor for a\r\ncottage near Vicenza, where:\r\n\r\n                    _Dopo sparsi al vento\r\n      Tanti sogni superbi e tanto foco\r\n      Di poesia dagl’ anni inerti spento,\r\n      Voluntario romito in questo loco,\r\n      Tra pochi arbori e fior vivo contento._\r\n\r\nThis retirement, nevertheless, produced some of Zanella’s most\r\ndelicate poetry, comprised in his dainty little volume _Astichello ed\r\naltre Poesie_, not yet included in his works. One of the most beautiful\r\nof his poems, _The Redbreast_ (_Il Pettirostro_), marvellously\r\nresembles the idylls of Coleridge, with whose works Zanella betrays his\r\nacquaintance. Charming, also, are the sonnets celebrating the various\r\naspects of the local river, the little Astichello, such as this upon\r\nthe sympathy between man and Nature in time of drought, a “pathetic\r\nfallacy,” perhaps, but none the worse for that:--\r\n\r\n      _Shrunk to a thread, the dwindling waters stray\r\n          Where Astichello 'neath the poplar flows\r\n          With languid tide that scarce avails to sway\r\n      The moss that nigh the midmost channel grows._\r\n\r\n      _Sirius the while, ablaze with fiery ray,\r\n          Above the unsheltered meadow throbs and glows;\r\n          And all the blithe fecundity of May\r\n      One withering waste of dismal yellow shows._\r\n\r\n      _The peasant groans despair, and shakes his head;\r\n          The friendly stream, munificent no more,\r\n          Barred from the brink it lately overran,\r\n      Like rustic met with rustic to deplore\r\n          The common ill, wails feebly from its bed,\r\n          Mingling its music with the plaint of man._\r\n\r\nZanella might have applied to himself the proud humility of Musset,\r\n_Mon verre n’est pas grand, mais je bois dans mon verre_. His modest\r\nstrain was independent of traditional or contemporary influence.\r\nThe other poets of the time are more historically significant as\r\nrepresenting the decadence of the romantic school. A new development\r\nwas urgently required to make good its exhausted vitality. The problem\r\nwas solved much in the same way as that of the renovation of the\r\noperatic stage, left void by the once brilliant but now moribund school\r\nof Rossini, save that in that instance the evening star of the old\r\ndispensation was also the morning star of the new. No such Janus-Verdi\r\narose upon poetry, but the man for the occasion was found in the\r\nprincipal figure of our next chapter, Giosuè Carducci.\r\n\r\nThe drama of the period has only one eminent representative, PIETRO\r\nCOSSA (1830-80), and his works, strictly speaking, fall somewhat\r\nlater. Cossa, though fine both in versification and rhetoric, is\r\nessentially more of a playwright than of a poet, but half redeems his\r\ndeficiencies by a quality not too common on the tragic stage of our\r\nday, masculine strength. Almost every scene is powerful, the action\r\nrarely halts or lingers, there is never any room for doubt as to the\r\nauthor’s intention, and the language is energetic without bombast.\r\nCossa’s shortcomings are mainly in the higher region of art. He has\r\nlittle creative power, and although he is occasionally felicitous in\r\nthe invention of a minor character, he rarely ventures to travel beyond\r\nthe record in the delineation of the historical personages who form the\r\nmost important portion of his dramatic flock. There is no penetration,\r\nno subtlety, nothing to manifest endowment with any insight beyond\r\nthe ordinary. As conventional representations, however, Cossa’s\r\ncharacters are brilliant, and he may even be accused of excess in the\r\naccumulation of historical traits, as though he could not bear to part\r\nwith an anecdote. _Nero_, _Messalina_, _Cola di Rienzo_, _The Borgias_,\r\n_Cleopatra_, _Julian the Apostate_ are among the most remarkable of his\r\nnumerous historical tragedies; if not great plays or dramatic poems,\r\nthey are, at all events, very splendid historical masquerades. There\r\nis more originality in his one comedy, _Plautus and his Age_, a lively\r\npicture of Roman society in Plautus’s time.\r\n\r\nThe period immediately preceding the establishment of Italian unity\r\nbrought forth many novels, mostly of the Manzonian school. The most\r\nimportant of these have been already mentioned. FRANCESCO DOMENICO\r\nGUERAZZI (1804-73), of infelicitous memory as a politician, had\r\nsufficient force as an historical novelist to deviate from the\r\nManzonian model, and to obtain for a while an European reputation with\r\nhis _Battle of Benevento_, _Siege of Florence_, and _Pasquale Paoli_.\r\nHe was a man of powerful but unregulated character, and the inequality\r\nextends to his writings; his diction is extolled, his style condemned.\r\nItalian fiction had a serious loss in Ippolito Nievo, drowned on his\r\nreturn from Garibaldi’s expedition to Sicily. “Perhaps,” says Vernon\r\nLee, “no better picture could be given of Italy in the last years of\r\nthe eighteenth century than that contained in Nievo’s _Confessioni di\r\nun Ottuagenario_.”\r\n\r\nThe literary period which we have been traversing in the last two\r\nchapters may be approximately described as that extending from the\r\nfall of Napoleon the First (1814) to the intervention of Napoleon the\r\nThird in Italian politics (1859). It saw the later works of Monti\r\nand Foscolo, all the chief productions of Manzoni, and everything\r\nof Leopardi’s. Apart from these, it produced no great genius, but a\r\nnumber of highly distinguished writers who did honour to their own\r\nliterature without producing any marked effect upon the literatures of\r\nforeign nations. The main reason of this circumscription of Italian\r\ninfluence was the legitimate preoccupation of Italy with her own\r\naffairs. The main aspiration of every Italian breast was the expulsion\r\nof the foreigner and the constitution of the national unity, whether\r\nas monarchy, federation, or republic. This common thought gave a\r\nnoble unity to the authorship of the period, but could not materially\r\naffect contemporary literatures, although Mazzini’s English writings,\r\nMr. Gladstone’s Neapolitan pamphlets, Sydney Dobell’s _Roman_, Mrs.\r\nBrowning’s _Casa Guidi Windows_ and _Poems before Congress_, and divers\r\npoems of Robert Browning, and Algernon Swinburne, and Dante Rossetti,\r\nshow that England was not uninfluenced by it. In the next generation,\r\nItalian letters, though, except for the poets Carducci and D’Annunzio,\r\nrather retrograding than advancing in merit, became more influential by\r\nbecoming more cosmopolitan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI\r\n                    CONTEMPORARY ITALIAN LITERATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present age of letters in Italy resembles its contemporary\r\nliterary epochs in the one respect in which these agree among\r\nthemselves and differ from most preceding ages; it is an age of\r\nliterary anarchy. No standard of taste exists to which it is deemed\r\nessential to conform, and antipathetic schools flourish comfortably,\r\nif not always peaceably, side by side. This was the case with the\r\nGreek schools of philosophy under the Roman Empire, but in literature\r\nhas rarely happened before the nineteenth century. At almost all\r\nformer periods some prevailing canon of taste has stamped the literary\r\nproductions of the era with its own signet, and the most celebrated\r\nauthors of the day have legislated for the rest. The Goethes, the\r\nVictor Hugos, the Tennysons of our time, while powerfully affecting\r\ncontemporary thought, have failed to thus impress their image and\r\nsuperscription on contemporary style. Scepticism which at former\r\nperiods would have horrified the coævals of Pope or Bembo, is\r\naudaciously professed with regard to the merits of greater men; and\r\nwhereas, in former ages, admiration meant imitation, some of the\r\nsincerest votaries of a Hugo or a Browning would be farthest from\r\nattempting to reproduce their mannerisms. It is quite true that the\r\nendeavour is still sometimes made to erect individual tastes and\r\ndistastes into articles of faith, that we are confidently told that\r\nsuch a writer or such a form of art is hopelessly antiquated, and\r\nthat such another is accepted by the right-minded. But this dogmatism\r\nis invariably an expression of individual taste, and has no real\r\nsubstance and no permanence. The change cannot but be salutary if,\r\nas we believe, it is in the main an effect of the expansion of the\r\narea of knowledge. The class of intelligent readers is now so greatly\r\nenlarged that the legislation of academies and the verdict of coteries\r\nreach comparatively but a little way; readers think for themselves\r\nmore than they did of old; and if the public taste is less disciplined\r\nthan formerly, it is in less danger of being biassed in one direction.\r\nIt may be added that the armistice between the classic and romantic\r\nschools, consequent upon the proved inability of each to subdue the\r\nother, has demonstrated the impossibility of any infallible æsthetic\r\ncriterion. Men disputed what this criterion might be, and different\r\nconceptions of it prevailed in different ages, but the existence of\r\nsome definite standard entitled to exact conformity was questioned by\r\nnone. Now it is generally recognised that men are born classicists\r\nor romanticists, as they have been said to be born Platonists or\r\nAristotelians, and that the right course for every author is to\r\ncultivate his powers in whatsoever direction Nature has assigned\r\nto them, and for every reader to strive to appreciate excellence\r\nwhencesoever it comes. The result is life, spirit, energy, but a\r\ncommotion as of tossing billows, which may or may not eventually settle\r\ndown into the calm of an accepted theory of art.\r\n\r\nWe cannot speak in Italy more than elsewhere of any great writer\r\nas ruling his age and prescribing laws to his contemporaries.\r\nIndividual genius, however, is no less effective than of old upon\r\nthose constitutionally in sympathy with it, and no gifted writer\r\ncan introduce a new style without enlisting disciples and provoking\r\nantagonists. Such a genius and such a style appertain to GIOSUÈ\r\nCARDUCCI (born 1836), the one contemporary poet of Italy who, if we\r\nexcept Gabriele d’Annunzio, “in shape and gesture proudly eminent,”\r\nstands forth like a tower from the rest, and who has made an abiding\r\nreputation as the introducer of the new elements needed to replace the\r\nexpiring impulse of the romantic school. Like many of his compeers,\r\nCarducci partakes of both classic and romantic elements; romantic in\r\nhis revolt against convention, classic in his worship of antique form;\r\nand it is in great measure this duality which renders him so important\r\nand interesting.\r\n\r\nCarducci, far from being the literary dictator of his age, is perhaps\r\nnot less distasteful to the ultra-realists for whom he paved the way,\r\nthan to the romanticists whom he overthrew, yet is in a very special\r\nsense the representative of his age and nation. The commencement\r\nof poetical activity synchronised with a new dispensation in the\r\nworld of politics. The reviving nation must have a new poet or none.\r\nEgypt was plainly unfit to sing the songs of Sion. The submission of\r\nManzoni, the despair of Leopardi, had in their respective ways well\r\nsuited an age of slavery; but the age of liberty had now arrived, and\r\ncraved strains combative, resonant, and joyous. The Pope’s obstinate\r\nclinging to the temporal power also compelled the national poet to be\r\nanti-clerical. Neither Carducci’s political nor his religious views\r\nwanted anything essential to the effectual fulfilment of his mission:\r\nthat their vehemence sometimes transgressed the limits of good sense\r\nand good taste would probably now be acknowledged by himself. It was\r\nequally important that the form should correspond to the feeling. The\r\nnew spirit sought a new body. Carducci solved the problem in the same\r\nmanner as Chiabrera would have solved it two centuries and a half\r\nbefore, had Chiabrera’s genius equalled his discernment. He perceived\r\nthat in the circumstances of his day a return to classic models would\r\nbe no retrogression, but renovation for Italian poetry: unfortunately\r\nhe had no true insight into the classical spirit. This Carducci\r\npossessed, and there are few happier examples of the alliance of one\r\nliterature with another than the poems, the most important part of his\r\nwork, in which he has kept classical examples steadily before him. The\r\nimitation, it must be understood, is one of form and not of essence;\r\nthe themes are but occasionally classical, and even when this is the\r\ncase express the feelings of a modern Italian spirit. Imitate classical\r\nforms as the poet may, he is essentially the man of the nineteenth\r\ncentury: his variety of mood and theme is great; his orchestra has a\r\nplace for every instrument; but in nine cases out of ten the direction\r\nto the performer is _con brio_. By this dashing vigour Carducci has\r\npoured new blood into the exhausted veins of Italian poetry, and\r\nadministered an antidote to her besetting maladies by the example of a\r\nstyle condensed, nervous, and terse to a fault. Epic or dramatic power\r\nhe does not claim: his genius is entirely lyrical.\r\n\r\nCarducci’s first volume appeared in 1857, and the events of the\r\nfollowing years called forth a number of occasional poems, clearly\r\nindicating the representative poet of the people and the time. In\r\n1865, the vigorous “Hymn to Satan” provoked the controversy which the\r\npoet had no doubt designed. His Satan, it hardly need be said, is not\r\nthe monarch of the fallen seraphim, but the spirit of revolt against\r\nsocial and ecclesiastical tyranny, more of a Luther than a Lucifer.\r\n_Levia Gravia_ (1867) greatly extended the poet’s reputation. _Odi\r\nBarbare_ (1877) excited a literary controversy almost as virulent as\r\nthe theological. The splendour of the diction was beyond question, but\r\nwhat was to be said to the novel or exotic forms in which the poet had\r\nthought fit to clothe it? To us, the naturalisation of the Alcaic and\r\nSapphic metres appears most successful, although in the former the\r\nwriter has permitted himself some deviation from the Horatian model,\r\nand the form is perhaps too deeply impressed with his own personality\r\nto become frequent in Italian literature. Most of the other forms,\r\nincluding the hexameters and pentameters, seem to us either too stiff\r\nor too intricate to be quite satisfactorily manipulated even by\r\nCarducci himself; but the study of them must be a valuable training\r\nfor practitioners in more facile metres. If the form be sometimes\r\ntoo elaborate, there can be no dispute as to the weight and massive\r\nmajesty of the sense. Carducci has solved the problem which baffled\r\nthe Renaissance, of linking strength of thought to artifice of form.\r\nThe _Rime Nuove_ brought him new laurels, and his poetical career has\r\npaused for the present with a noble ode on the tercentenary of Tasso in\r\n1895. The jubilee of his connection with the University of Bologna was\r\ncelebrated by a great demonstration in 1896, and, reconciled with the\r\nmonarchy which he once opposed, he enjoys the honour of a Senator of\r\nthe Kingdom. A Liberal but a Royalist, a freethinker but a theist, he\r\nis happily placed to exert a reconciling and moderating influence alike\r\nin the political and the intellectual sphere.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of translating Carducci’s more characteristic poems\r\nare almost insuperable. He is not in the least obscure, but his\r\nnoble and austere form is indissolubly wedded to the sense, and in\r\nreproduction his bronze too often becomes plaster. Many versions,\r\nmoreover, would be required to render justice to the various aspects of\r\nhis many-sided genius--his love of country, his passion for beautiful\r\nform, his Latin and Hellenic enthusiasm, his photographic intensity of\r\ndescriptive touch, his sympathy for honest labour and uncomplaining\r\npoverty, his capacity for caressing affection and scathing indignation.\r\nThe following poem powerfully exhibits his intense devotion to the\r\npast, and faith in the future of his Italy. The subject is the statue\r\nof Victory in the Temple of Vespasian at Brescia; but to appreciate the\r\nfull force of the poem, it must be known that the statue was a recent\r\ndiscovery of happiest augury (1826), and that Brescia had been the\r\nscene of an heroic defence and a cruel sack in the uprising against the\r\nAustrians in 1848:\r\n\r\n      _Hast thou, high Virgin, wings of good augury\r\n      Waved o’er the crouching, targeted phalanxes,\r\n        With knee-propt shield and spear protended,\r\n        Biding the shock of the hostile onset?_\r\n\r\n      _Or hast thou, soaring in front of the eagles,\r\n      Led surging swarms of Marsian soldiery,\r\n        With blaze of fulgent light the neighing\r\n        Parthian steed and his lord appalling?_\r\n\r\n      _Thy pinions folded, thy stern foot haughtily\r\n      Pressing the casque of foeman unhelmeted;--\r\n        Whose fair renown for feat triumphant\r\n        Art on the orb of thy shield inscribing?_\r\n\r\n      _An archon’s name, who boldly in face of Wrong\r\n      The freeman’s law upheld and immunity?\r\n        A consul’s, far and wide the Latin\r\n        Limit and glory and awe enlarging?_\r\n\r\n      _Thee throned on Alpine pinnacle loftily,\r\n      Radiant 'mid tempest, heralding might I hear_,\r\n        Kings and peoples, here stands Italy,\r\n        Weaponed to strike for her soil and honour.\r\n\r\n      _Lydia, the while, a garland of flowerets,\r\n      By sad October strewn o’er the wreck of Rome,\r\n        To deck thee braids, and gently bending,\r\n        Questioneth, as at thy foot she lays it:_\r\n\r\n      _“What thoughts, what visions, Victory, came to thee,\r\n      Years on years in the humid imprisonment\r\n        Of earth immured? the German horses\r\n        Heardest thou stamp o’er thy brow Hellenic?”_\r\n\r\n      _“I heard,” she answers, flashing and fulminant,\r\n      “Heard and endured, for glory of Greece am I,\r\n        And strength of Rome, in bronze immortal\r\n        Sped without flaw through the fleeting ages._\r\n\r\n      _“The ages passed like the twelve birds ominous,\r\n      Descried by gaze of Romulus anciently:\r\n        They passed, I rose: thy Gods, proclaiming,\r\n        Italy, see! and thy buried heroes._\r\n\r\n      _“Proud of her fortune, Brescia enshrinèd me,\r\n      Brescia the stalwart, Brescia the iron-girt,\r\n        Italia’s lioness, her vesture\r\n        Dyed in the blood of her land’s invaders.”_\r\n\r\nA large proportion of Carducci’s lyrics flow with more of liquid\r\nease in more familiar metres, better adapted for popularity. This is\r\nespecially the case with his impassioned addresses to the dead or to\r\ncontemporaries who have won his admiration, and the poems which depict\r\nordinary life, such as “A Dream in Summer,” “On a Saint Peter’s Eve,”\r\nand “The Mother,” whose apparently loose but really well-knit texture\r\nis admirably reproduced by his American translator Mr. Sewall, and\r\nwhich are such pieces as Walt Whitman might have written if he had been\r\na poet in virtue of his art as well as of his nature. Perhaps none of\r\nthe shorter pieces is more expressive of his profound humanity than his\r\napotheosis of patient toil under the figure of “The Ox,” ably rendered\r\nby Mr. Sewall, a poem Egyptian in its grave massiveness and tranquil\r\nrepose:\r\n\r\n      _I love thee, pious Ox; a gentle feeling\r\n        Of vigour and of peace thou giv’st my heart.\r\n        How solemn, like a monument, thou art!\r\n      Over wide fertile fields thy calm gaze stealing!\r\n      Unto the yoke with grave contentment kneeling,\r\n        To man’s quick work thou dost thy strength impart:\r\n        He shouts and goads, and, answering thy smart,\r\n      Thou turn’st on him thy patient eyes appealing._\r\n\r\n      _From thy broad nostrils, black and wet, arise\r\n        Thy breath’s soft fumes; and on the still air swells,\r\n        Like happy hymn, thy lowing’s mellow strain.\r\n      In the grave sweetness of thy tranquil eyes\r\n        Of emerald, broad and still reflected, dwells\r\n        All the divine green silence of the plain._\r\n\r\nCarducci has rendered his country much service as a literary critic,\r\nespecially of the Renaissance, and of the Risorgimento of the\r\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries. He is not subtle or profound,\r\nbut puts forth unanswerably propositions dictated by the soundest\r\ncommon-sense. There is something Teutonic as well as Italian in\r\nhis composition, and he recalls no precursor so much as the German\r\npoet Platen, an equal master of form; but Platen, though a real\r\npatriot, is more at home with any nation than his own. It is a chief\r\nglory of Carducci to have united an intensely patriotic spirit to a\r\ncomprehensive cosmopolitanism. Though ranging far and wide to enrich\r\nthe domestic literature with new metrical forms, he loves those in\r\nwhich the Italian genius has embodied itself from days of old, and\r\nis always ready to defend them against degenerate countrymen, no\r\nless than against unappreciative foreigners. Like Wordsworth, he has\r\nsimultaneously vindicated and illustrated the sonnet:\r\n\r\n      _Brief strain with much in little rife; whose tone,\r\n        As worlds untrodden rose upon his thought,\r\n        Dante touched lightly; that Petrarca sought,\r\n      Flower among flowers by gliding waters grown;\r\n      That from trump epical of Tasso blown\r\n        Pealed through his prison; that wert gravely fraught\r\n        With voice austere by him who marble fought\r\n      To free the spirit he divined in stone:--_\r\n\r\n      _To Æschylus new-born by Avon’s shore\r\n        Thou camest harbinger of Art, to be\r\n      A hidden cell for hidden sorrow’s store;\r\n        On thee smiled Milton and Camoens; thee,\r\n      His rout of lines unleashing with a roar,\r\n        Bavius blasphemes; the dearer thence to me._\r\n\r\nCarducci’s example could not but create a school of poets, many of\r\ngreat merit, but most of whom stand to him more or less in the relation\r\nof disciples to a master. The chief exception is the only one who can\r\nclaim, like Timotheus, to “divide the crown,” GABRIELE D’ANNUNZIO.\r\n\r\nD’Annunzio (born 1863) is a second Marini, endowed with an even\r\nmore brilliant genius, and better armed against besetting faults. It\r\nis terrible to think what synchronism with Marini might have made of\r\nhim, but it has been his good fortune to have had Carducci’s example\r\nbefore his eyes, and his merit to have profited by it. At the same time\r\nhis genius is so distinct from Carducci’s as to vindicate for him an\r\nindependent position. To employ Coventry Patmore’s happy application of\r\na passage in Zephaniah to the poetic art, D’Annunzio rather represents\r\n“Beauty,” and Carducci “Bands”; the note of the one is restraint,\r\nand that of the other is exuberance. D’Annunzio’s verse is not cast\r\nin bronze like Carducci’s, nor has he his rival’s splendid virility\r\nor his devotion to ideal interests; his affluence is nevertheless so\r\nwell restrained by a natural instinct for form that it never, as with\r\nMarini, becomes riotous extravagance. Some of the metrical forms,\r\nindeed, which, influenced as may be surmised by Mr. Swinburne, he has\r\nendeavoured to introduce, seem ill adapted to the genius of the Italian\r\nlanguage, though they would probably succeed well in English. But\r\nnothing can be more satisfactory than the form of his sonnets or of his\r\nballad-romances, and he has enriched Italian poetry with one new form\r\nof great beauty, the _rima nona_, a happy compromise between the terse\r\npurity of the national octave and the rich harmony, like the chiming\r\nof many waters, of the English Spenserian stanza, which no foreign\r\nliterature has yet succeeded in acclimatising. It is also to his honour\r\nthat, while no writer is more partial to the employment of unusual\r\nwords, commonly derived from science or natural history, the effect\r\nis that of brilliant mosaic without a mosaic’s rigidity, but soft and\r\nliquid as a glowing canvas.\r\n\r\nIn many respects D’Annunzio presents a strong affinity to Keats;\r\nbut to the innocent sensuousness which rejoices in the reproduction\r\nof sumptuous beauty, he adds that which purposely ministers to\r\nvoluptuousness. This might be forgiven as the failing of a youthful\r\nand ardent poet, and becomes, indeed, much less obtrusive in his later\r\npoetical writings. The misfortune is that nothing seems to be taking\r\nits place. Had years brought D’Annunzio “the philosophic mind,” had his\r\nthird volume compared with its predecessors as _Locksley Hall_ and _In\r\nMemoriam_ compare with the _Lotus Eaters_, he would be at the head, not\r\nmerely of Italian, but of European poets. His most recent productions,\r\nwhile indicating, as must almost inevitably be the case, an\r\nimpoverishment of the merely sensuous opulence of his youth, manifest\r\nbut slight advance in power of thought, in dignity of utterance, in\r\nhuman or national sympathies, in anything that discriminates the noon\r\nof poetical power from its morning. The _Canto Novo_ (1881) and the\r\n_Intermezzo_ (1883) were a splendid dawn; and _L’Isotteo_ (1885) and\r\n_La Chimera_ (1888) revealed further development, not indeed in power\r\nof thought, but in objectivity and in mastery of form. Much of all\r\nthese volumes is mere voluptuous dreaming, but the pictures of nature\r\nare marvellously vivid; such pieces as the little unrhymed lyric of\r\ntwelve lines, _O falce di luna calante_, reveal the natural magic which\r\nis perhaps the rarest endowment of genius; and the melody is such as\r\nis only granted to a true poet. In the _Poema Paradisiaco_, the joy of\r\nlife is evidently on the wane, and, except in a few pieces of exquisite\r\npathos, such as _Consolazione_, seems in danger of being replaced,\r\nnot by a nobler and more serious theory of life, but by the worst\r\nkind of pessimism, that born of mere satiety. The most recent poems,\r\nthe _Odi Navali_ (1893), though patriotic in theme, appear tame and\r\nartificial in comparison with earlier work. The epilogue to the _Poema\r\nParadisiaco_, nevertheless, argues progress in the right direction, and\r\nleaves room to hope that D’Annunzio may yet take rank not merely with\r\npoets eminent for melody, fancy, and imagination, but with those who\r\nhave counted among the shaping forces of their time.\r\n\r\nThe general impression of D’Annunzio’s poetry is one of dazzling\r\nsplendour and intoxicating perfume. The poet seems determined to leave\r\nno sense ungratified, and not to omit a hue, an odour, or a cadence\r\nthat can by any possibility be pressed into his service. It says much\r\nfor the genuineness of his poetical faculty that he should actually be\r\nable to perform this without falling into extravagance; but although\r\nhis lavish luxury of phrase and description is kept within the limits\r\nof taste, the too uniform splendour satiates and fatigues. Mr. Greene’s\r\ntranslations in his Italian Lyrists convey a very good notion of\r\nD’Annunzio’s most usual manner. The following sonnet may serve as a\r\nspecimen:--\r\n\r\n      _Beneath the white full-moon the murmuring seas\r\n        Send songs of love across the pine-tree glade;\r\n      The moonlight filtering through the dome-topped trees\r\n        Fills with weird light the vast and secret shade;\r\n      A fresh salt perfume on the Illyrian breeze\r\n        From sea-weeds on the rock is hither swayed,\r\n      While my sad heart, worn out and ill at ease,\r\n        A wild poetic longing doth invade._\r\n\r\n      _But now more joyous still the love-songs flow\r\n        O’er waves of silver sea; from pine to pine\r\n      A sweet name echoes in the winds that blow;\r\n        And, hovering through yon spaces diamantine,\r\n      A phantom fair with silent flight and slow,\r\n        Smiles on me from its great-orbed eyes divine._\r\n\r\nAt the same time D’Annunzio has another style, principally exhibited\r\nin his minor lyrics and his ballad romances, where simple but perfect\r\nmelody is mated with hearty vigour. The contrast between Tennyson’s\r\n_Palace of Art_ and his _Edward Gray_ is hardly greater than that\r\nbetween the brilliant poetical landscape just quoted, and this joyous\r\n_aubade_:--\r\n\r\n      _While yet the veil of misty dew\r\n        Conceals the morning flush,_\r\n      (How light of foot the foxes’ crew\r\n        Are scampering in the bush!)\r\n\r\n      _On damask bed my Clara spends\r\n        In dreams the idle hours:_\r\n      (Warm the wet meadow’s breath ascends,\r\n        And herbs are sweet as flowers.)\r\n\r\n      _Lift, lovely lady all amort,\r\n        The glory of your head._\r\n      (The hounds are yelling in the court\r\n        Enough to wake the dead.)\r\n\r\n      _Hear’st not the note of merry horn\r\n        That calls thee to the chase?_\r\n      (In glades of ancient oak and thorn\r\n        The deer hath left his trace.)\r\n\r\n      _With manly vesture, trim and tight,\r\n        Those budding breasts be bound;_\r\n      (I hear thy jennet neigh delight,\r\n        And paw the paven ground.)\r\n\r\n      _Soho! my beauty! down the stairs\r\n        At last! Aha! Huzza!_\r\n      (Red morning o’er the mountain flares.)\r\n        _To saddle! and away!_\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that although the Carduccis and D’Annunzios of the\r\npresent day may not rank higher as poets than the Montis and Leopardis\r\nof the past, they have done far more to fit the Italian lyre with new\r\nstrings, and have opened up paths of progress formerly undreamed of.\r\nMany of the novel and exotic forms they have introduced will richly\r\nrepay cultivation, but the problem will be to employ the technique\r\nacquired by their practice to the embellishment and elevation of\r\nforms more adapted for general use. This the great master of modern\r\nItalian poetry has seen, and, magnificently as he has handled the more\r\nelaborate harmonies, it is the simple, popular song that he invokes\r\nafter all, while incomparably exemplifying it:\r\n\r\n      _Cura e onor de’ padri miei,\r\n      Tu mi sei\r\n      Come lor sacra e diletta.\r\n      Ave, o rima: e dammi un fiore\r\n      Per l’amore,\r\n      E per l’odio una saetta._\r\n\r\nApart from these two chief names Italy possesses at present a\r\nnumber of excellent lyrical poets. The best known is perhaps Olindo\r\nGuerrini, whose first poems, _Posthuma_, supposed to be edited from the\r\npapers of an imaginary Lorenzo Stecchetti, caused a great sensation,\r\nnot so much by their unquestionable talent as by their audacious\r\nimmorality. Of late years Guerrini has produced a number of poems on\r\nthe political circumstances of the country, many of which are perfect\r\nmasterpieces of refined form and energetic expression. As much may\r\nbe said for the political verses of the Parliamentary orator Felice\r\nCavallotti. The poet of the social revolution is Mario Rapisardi, a\r\nSicilian, known also as the literary antagonist of Carducci; while the\r\nsorrows of the poor are pathetically expressed by a lady, Ada Negri.\r\nAlessandro Arnaboldi, lately deceased, possessed an eminent faculty\r\nfor description and excelled in grave and dignified lyric, not unlike\r\nMatthew Arnold; while Italy has her James Thomson in the gloomy and\r\npowerful Arturo Graf. Antonio Fogazzaro, on the other hand, is the\r\npoet of hope and faith. Enrico Panzacchi, less individual than most\r\nof these, surpasses them all in grace and variety; Edmondo de Amicis,\r\ncelebrated as a traveller, has the gift of brilliant description; Luigi\r\nCapuana has emulated Carducci’s metrical experiments; and excellent\r\npoetry has been produced by Giovanni Marradi, Giuseppe Pascoli, and\r\nAlfredo Baccelli. Translated specimens of these and other poets,\r\nwith biographical and bibliographical particulars, will be found in\r\nMr. G. A. Greene’s _Italian Lyrists of To-Day_. On the whole, the\r\npresent condition of Italian poetry is one of abundant vitality, but\r\nof deficient concentration either in great men or great poems. The\r\nserious drama is best represented by Cavallotti’s tragedies and the New\r\nTestament trilogy of Giuseppe Bovio, and the humorous by the comedies\r\nof Roberto Bracco and Giacinto Gallina.\r\n\r\nThe novel is at present as vigorously cultivated in Italy as in any\r\ncivilised nation, and the talent it attracts cannot be altogether\r\ndevoid of results. No talent, however, succeeds in permanently\r\nnaturalising forms of literature uncongenial to the national mind,\r\nand it remains to be seen whether this is or is not the case with the\r\nnovel in Italy. The novelette arose spontaneously, and was maintained\r\nwithout difficulty; but with every encouragement from the example of\r\nother nations, Italy failed to acclimatise either romantic fiction or\r\nthe novel of manners, until far entered into the nineteenth century.\r\nThe inference that lengthy story-telling must be alien to the genius of\r\nthe people is confirmed by the general inferiority of modern Italian\r\nnovelists. One or two, such as Matilda Serao, Salvatore Farini, and\r\nGiulio Barrili, have acquired a reputation beyond the limits of their\r\nown country. One or two others, such as Antonio Fogazzaro, the leader\r\nof a reaction towards a spiritualistic conception of things; Carlo\r\nPlacci, the very promising author of _Un Furto_; and Luciano Zuccoli,\r\nauthor of _Roberta_, have shown the ability to impress themselves upon\r\nthe national literature.\r\n\r\nOnly two, however, seem to stand forth very decidedly as masters of\r\nfiction. One of them is Gabriele d’Annunzio, already treated as a\r\npoet. D’Annunzio’s novels have made more noise than his poems, being\r\nfrom one point of view much more, from another much less, suited for\r\ngeneral perusal. The scandal which has grown up about them has diverted\r\nattention from their real merits of fine style and conscientious\r\nworkmanship. As an artist, D’Annunzio is almost as admirable in prose\r\nas in verse; and if with his descriptive he combined the creative\r\ngift, all his immoralities would not debar him from permanent\r\nrenown. Unfortunately, he is like most French and Italian novelists,\r\nmonotonously restricted to the portrayal of a single passion, and\r\nhis splendid scenery is the background for trivial characters. He\r\nreminds us of the demon in Victor Hugo’s poem, who consumes the\r\nstrength of lions and the wisdom of elephants in fashioning a locust.\r\nThis is the besetting sin of the novelists of France and Italy:\r\nwith a few brilliant exceptions on both sides, the English novel\r\nlives by character, the French by situation. D’Annunzio’s novels are\r\nnevertheless important literary events, and cannot be omitted from\r\nany survey of modern European literature. They have already gained\r\nhim renown and circulation in France and the United States. The most\r\ncelebrated are _Il Piacere_, _Il Trionfo della Morte_, _La Vergine\r\ndelle Rocce_, the last of which is exempt from most of the objections\r\njustly urged against the others.\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI VERGA (b. 1840) rivals the European reputation of D’Annunzio,\r\nand is, like him, the head of a realistic school; but his realism is of\r\nquite another sort, owing nothing to Zola or Maupassant. He is the most\r\neminent European representative of the local novel, dealing with the\r\nmanners, humours, and peculiar circumstances of some special locality.\r\nThe vogue of this style was perhaps originally due to George Sand’s\r\nidyllic pictures of Berri. Verga has found a yet more interesting\r\ncorner of the world to delineate. A Sicilian, though residing at Milan,\r\nhe has made his native island the scene of his fiction. Centuries of\r\nmisgovernment have unhappily accumulated stores of tragic material in\r\nthe people’s misery and oppression, and the ferocity and vindictiveness\r\nthese have engendered. Verga depicts these circumstances with the\r\nfidelity of a dispassionate observer and the skill of an artist. His\r\nbooks not only attract in their own day, but will be treasured in the\r\nfuture among the most valuable documents for the social history of\r\nSicily.\r\n\r\nAny one of even the minor poets whom we have enumerated has a chance\r\nof reaching posterity, for their work is at all events individual, and\r\nexpressive of the personality of the author. If this is sufficiently\r\ninteresting, the work may live, though it be far from inaugurating a\r\nnew literary era like Carducci’s. It is otherwise with the contemporary\r\nprose literature of Italy. A history, a biography, philology like\r\nAscoli’s or D’Ancona’s, a work on social science like Sella’s or\r\nMorselli’s may possess great value as the work of an expert, even\r\nthough devoid of individuality; but in this case it must sooner or\r\nlater lapse into the category of books of reference. Such appears\r\nto be the case with most of the excellent work now being done in\r\nItaly in these and other departments: the statue is carved, but no\r\nname is inscribed upon the pedestal, for the sculpture is the work\r\nof a craftsman, not of an artist. Exceptions may be made in favour\r\nof a few writers recently deceased--Ruggiero Bonghi, translator of\r\nPlato and historian of Rome, one of the soundest heads in Italy;\r\nGiuseppe Chiarini, champion of Carducci; Enrico Nencioni, lately lost\r\nto his country, a high authority upon English literature; Angelo\r\nde Gubernatis, a brilliant and almost too versatile critic and\r\nphilologist; and Giuseppe Guerzoni, raised above himself by his theme\r\nwhen he wrote the life of Garibaldi. Among living men, two at least\r\nhave won an abiding reputation as writers, apart from the utilitarian\r\nworth of their work--Pascale Villari, biographer of Savonarola and\r\nMachiavelli, and writer on the social conditions of the South; and\r\nDomenico Comparetti, author of _Virgilio nel Medio Evo_. In general,\r\nhowever, the chief distinction of contemporary writers on serious\r\nsubjects seems to be their general diligence and good sense. Admirable\r\nwriters have gained European renown for themselves, and exalted the\r\nfame of their country by the substantial merit of works making no\r\nespecial pretension to literary distinction. Thus Ascoli stands high in\r\ngeneral philology; D’Ancona, Tigri, and Rubieri in literary history;\r\nLanciani and Rossi in archæology; Nitti in historical research;\r\nPasolini and Solerti in biography; Cremona in mathematics; Lombroso and\r\nFerrero in psychology; and Cossa in political economy.\r\n\r\nThese form a galaxy indeed, but belong rather to learning and science\r\nthan to literature. This temporary languor of pure literature may\r\nperhaps be accounted for when it is considered that one main factor\r\nof inspiration has been removed by the contentment of the national\r\naspirations. The subjection and oppression of the country, with all\r\ntheir evils, at all events afforded an intense stimulus to literary\r\ngenius. Every Italian heart was possessed by the emotions most\r\nconducive to impassioned composition; and patriotic sentiment, even\r\nwhen not expressed in words, imbued the whole of literature. The\r\ntension removed, it was perhaps inevitable that overstrained feelings\r\nshould decline to a lower level, which may be suddenly elevated by the\r\noccurrence of some great national crisis, or the appearance of some\r\ngenius gifted, like Mazzini and Carducci, with an especial power of\r\ninfluencing the young. What Italian letters seem to want above all\r\nthings is men, other than poets and novelists, capable of impressing\r\ntheir own individuality on what they write, and such men are most\r\nreadily formed either by the agitation of stirring times, or by the\r\ncontagious enthusiasm caught from a great teacher.\r\n\r\nThe opinions of many eminent living men of letters on the future of\r\ntheir country’s literature have been collected by Signor Ugo Ojetti in\r\nhis _Alla scoperta dei Letterati_ (1895). They are not in general of a\r\nvery encouraging character, but their weight is considerably impaired\r\nby their almost complete restriction to a single branch of literature,\r\nand that one whose preponderance is by no means to be desired. Almost\r\nall the authors interviewed by Signor Ojetti are novelists, and, so\r\nfar as appears from his reports, would appear utterly unconscious of\r\nthe existence of any class of literature but fiction, poetry, and\r\nthe drama. They seem to regard literature and _belles lettres_ as\r\nconvertible terms, and take no notice of the wider and more important\r\ndomains of history, biography, philosophy, moral and economic science,\r\nwhich may be and often have been in the most flourishing condition\r\nwhile _belles lettres_ languish. It is, indeed, much to be wished\r\nthat more of the literary talent of Italy were directed to solid\r\nand permanent work, and less to fiction, which must be ephemeral in\r\nproportion to the very fidelity with which it fulfils its ordinary task\r\nof depicting the manners of the day. Work like Comparetti’s _Virgilio\r\nnel Medio Evo_, for example, confers higher distinction on the national\r\nliterature than any number of novels, unless when creations of genius\r\nof a high order.\r\n\r\nSuch genius, when exercised in fiction or in poetry, does not depend\r\nfor its manifestation upon the state of the book market; the really\r\ngifted author obeys an impulse from within. “Genius does what it must,\r\nand talent does what it can.” If modern Italians have it in them\r\nto produce great books, they will not be prevented by such of the\r\nobstacles stated by Signor Ojetti’s confabulators as may be fairly\r\nresolved into one, the insufficient remuneration of literary work.\r\nIt is just to acknowledge, however, the existence of impediments of\r\nanother kind. From the earliest period of letters Italy has suffered\r\nfrom the variance of the written and the spoken language. The\r\nrefinements of cultivated circles at Rome were not accepted in the\r\nprovinces: there was a Latin of books and a Latin of ordinary life. In\r\nprocess of time the former became the exclusive speech of the learned,\r\nwhile the language of the vulgar gave birth to a number of dialects,\r\nout of which, when a vernacular literature came to exist, the Tuscan\r\nwas selected as the most appropriate for written speech. Hence there\r\nhas always been something artificial in Italian literary language. Many\r\nof the most gifted authors who happened to be born out of Tuscany never\r\nattained to write it with perfect correctness; and the jealous care\r\ntaken to ensure its purity tended to limit its flexibility and compass.\r\nIt thus became hardly adequate to deal with the mass of neologism\r\nabsolutely forced upon it by the development of modern civilisation.\r\n\r\n“The difficulty,” says Symonds, “under which a mother-tongue,\r\nartificially and critically fashioned like Italian, suffers when it\r\ncopes with ordinary affairs of modern life, is illustrated by the\r\nformation of feeble vocables, and by newspaper jargon,” of which he\r\ngives a horrible instance. The same critic wrote in 1877: “Italian\r\nhas undergone no process of transformation and regeneration according\r\nto the laws of organic growth since it first started. The different\r\ndistricts still use different dialects, while writers in all parts\r\nof the peninsula have conformed their style, as far as possible,\r\nto early Tuscan models. It may be questioned whether united Italy,\r\nhaving for the first time gained the necessary conditions of national\r\nconcentration, is not now at last about to enter on a new phase of\r\ngrowth in literature, which, after many years, will make the style of\r\nthe first authors more archaic than it seems at present.” The immense\r\ndifficulty experienced by so great a writer as Manzoni in reconciling\r\nvigour with purity of diction, and his complaints of the limited\r\nvocabulary at his disposal, seem to prove that these impediments are\r\nnot imaginary. Since Symonds wrote, however, a view differing in some\r\nrespects has been expressed by one of the few living men who may claim\r\nto be regarded as masters of Italian prose, Gabriele d’Annunzio. In\r\nthe dedicatory preface to his _Trionfo della Morte_ (1894), D’Annunzio\r\nenters into the question of the adequacy of the Italian language to\r\nexpress modern ideas, which he emphatically asserts. There is no\r\nrespect, he declares, in which it need envy other tongues, or anything\r\nthat it need wish to borrow from them. The misfortune is that its great\r\nresources are neglected by modern writers, whose ordinary vocabulary\r\nis limited to a few hundred words, many of illegitimate extraction or\r\nhopelessly disfigured by vulgar usage, and these thrown into sentences\r\nof nearly uniform length, destitute of logical connection and of the\r\nrhythmical accompaniment indispensable to a fine style. The remedy is\r\na return to the old authors; and, justly remarking that the novelists\r\nof the best period are entirely out of harmony with modern requirements\r\nby reason of their wholly objective character and incapacity for\r\npsychological analysis, D’Annunzio seriously advises modern romancers\r\nto enrich their vocabulary and perfect their style by a course of the\r\nancient ascetic, casuistical, and devotional writers. The Zolas of\r\nmodern Italy resorting for instruction to St. Catherine of Siena would\r\nindeed afford a scene for Aristophanes; yet from a merely stylistic\r\npoint of view the advice is judicious.\r\n\r\nAs regards the ancient writers, the effect would be to renovate them\r\ninstead of rendering them more archaic, as anticipated by Symonds,\r\nso far at least as concerns their vocabulary. Although perhaps an\r\ninevitable tribute to Time and Evolution, it is yet no gain to the\r\nEnglish language or literature that so much of our early writers should\r\nbe obsolete; and Italy would do well to preserve as much as possible\r\nthe speech of the original masters of her tongue, which can be best\r\neffected by keeping their phraseology in constant employment. It may be\r\nhoped that a standard of taste will thus be created enabling writers\r\nto deal satisfactorily with the mass of neologisms which the great\r\ndevelopment of modern civilisation renders it impossible to exclude,\r\nbut which, indiscriminately admitted, threaten to swamp and debase\r\nthe national speech, or possibly to sunder the common inheritance\r\ninto two languages, one for the scholar, the other for the multitude.\r\nIt is, indeed, a most serious problem for patriotic scholars in all\r\nnations how to preserve the continuity of the national speech amid the\r\nvicissitudes of the national life, and the tendencies which in the\r\nintellectual as in the physical sphere are always at work to wear all\r\ndiversities down to one monotonous level. The consolation is that,\r\nwhereas these agencies are mere unconscious forces, called into being\r\nby causes independent of the human will, the resisting influences have\r\ntheir origin in the will, and are capable of intelligent direction. It\r\nshould be the task of the cultivators of every literature to ascertain\r\nwhat course this literature has instinctively shaped for itself;\r\nwhat are the dominant ideas which have determined the course of its\r\ndevelopment. In Italy, from the first lyrists down to Carducci, from\r\nthe first prose writers down to D’Annunzio, the guiding principle\r\nwould seem to have been the love of perfect form and artistic finish,\r\nliable, like all other meritorious tendencies, to abuse, when its too\r\nexclusive pursuit has cramped originality; to aberration, when writers,\r\nremembering the end, have mistaken the means; but on the whole a right\r\nand laudable aim, because in harmony with the genius of the people and\r\nthe language. As it has been said that what is not clear is not French,\r\nso it might be added that what is not refined is not Italian.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the production of much inferior work, this character\r\nstill appertains to the literature in its best contemporary examples,\r\nthe only ones with which posterity is likely to concern itself. The\r\nenormous recent development, nevertheless, of the sphere of human\r\ninterests; the creation of new arts and sciences, necessitating a\r\ncorresponding expansion of the resources of language; the facility\r\nof intercourse among peoples, tending to a cosmopolitanism which\r\ncontinually threatens to obliterate national distinctions; the\r\nformation of an immense and imperfectly trained reading class, to\r\nwhose tastes the majority of authors must or at all events will\r\ncondescend--these are trying circumstances for every literature, and\r\nespecially for one whose special claims are polish and dignity. But if\r\nit be true that these latter qualities are not imported, or imposed\r\nby external pressure, but inherent in the constitution of the nation\r\nitself, it may well be hoped that they will adapt themselves to the\r\ncircumstances of the present, without breach of continuity with the\r\npast. Up to the present time this continuity appears to us unbroken,\r\nand we have been able to conceive of the history of Italian literature\r\nas biography, not so much of individual writers as of a single fair\r\nspirit living through them all, which has moulded, animated, and laid\r\naside all in their turn. Like other finite existences, this spirit has\r\nknown infancy, adolescence, and maturity, and must one day know decay\r\nand death; but the phenomena accompanying her present development\r\nseem to us rather to indicate that, in common with other literatures,\r\nshe is traversing a crisis than that she is entering upon a period\r\nof decadence. Every age of letters has its own peculiar peril: that\r\nof ours is the debasement of the standard of writing to the level of\r\nimperfectly educated readers. Against this danger Italian literature\r\nshould be especially protected by its close affinity to the languages\r\nof antiquity, by uniform practice and tradition ever since Dante called\r\nLove _the fountain of fair speech_[23], and by a refinement so deeply\r\nimbibed that it seems to have become a part of itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[23] _Risponde il fonte del gentil parlare._\r\n                                              --Sonnet XLII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of books which may be usefully consulted on various points\r\nof Italian literature is very considerable. Only the most important\r\ncan be named here, and those for the most part such as are written\r\nin English or Italian, and fall strictly under the heads of literary\r\nhistory or bibliography, or standard editions with indispensable\r\ncommentaries. Many books not referable to any of these classes, such\r\nas Burckhardt’s _Cicerone_, Des Brosses’s _Letters_, or Dennistoun’s\r\n_Lives of the Dukes of Urbino_, are incidentally of high value, but\r\ncannot be enumerated in a bibliographical list. Some few biographies,\r\nhowever, have been added which may be deemed essential. The dates given\r\nare in general those of the best or most accessible editions. Some of\r\nthe most important are out of print.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL COLLECTIONS OF ITALIAN AUTHORS\r\n\r\nD’Ancona and Bacci, _Manuale della Letteratura italiana_, 5 vols.\r\n1893-95. A most admirable selection, both for its soundness of\r\njudgment and its comprehensiveness. The notices of the various authors\r\nprefixed to the selections are excellent from the biographical and\r\nbibliographical points of view, and also from the critical when\r\ncriticism is sufficiently full, which is not always the case.--Cantù,\r\n_La Letteratura italiana esposta_, &c., 1851, and Morandi, _Antologia_,\r\n1893, are inferior to D’Ancona and Bacci, yet deserve attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL HISTORIES\r\n\r\nTiraboschi, _Storia della Letteratura italiana_, &c., 1822. The\r\nItalian literary historian _par excellence_, characterised at pp. 295,\r\n296 of this book. There is a continuation by Lombardi.--Sismondi,\r\n_Histoire de la Littérature du Midi de l’Europe_; numerous editions and\r\ntranslations, but hardly equal to its reputation.--Ginguené, _Histoire\r\nlittéraire d’Italie_, 14 vols., 1811-35 [the last four volumes by\r\nSalfi]. A work of extraordinary diligence and erudition, on no account\r\nto be neglected by the few who may have time to read it, though written\r\nfrom an eighteenth-century point of view now entirely antiquated. The\r\nchief literary defect is the immoderate space devoted to unravelling\r\nthe plots of uninteresting epics and dramas; this excess of diligence,\r\nhowever, renders it a valuable source of information concerning minor\r\nauthors frequently omitted.--This is also a valuable feature of\r\nCorniani, _I Secoli della Letteratura italiana_, 1832-33.--Bartoli,\r\n_Storia della Letteratura italiana_, 1875. This unfinished work is\r\nthe best authority for the history of the early period, beyond which\r\nit does not as yet extend. It is full of learning and research, but\r\nprolix.--Gaspary, _Geschichte der italienischen Litteratur_, &c.,\r\n1885. Another important work unfortunately left incomplete, breaking\r\noff in the Cinque Cento. The best of all the larger Italian literary\r\nhistories, but deficient in form, rather a quarry of material than a\r\nregular edifice. An English translation by H. Oelsner is in preparation.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORIES OF SPECIAL DEPARTMENTS\r\n\r\nCrescimbeni, _Istoria della volgar Poesia_, 1730. Quadrio, _Della\r\nStoria e della regione d’ogni Poesia_, 1739-52. Standard histories long\r\nout of print, but to be found in all good public libraries.--Muratori,\r\n_Della perfetta Poesia_, 1821. Characterised at p. 295.--Ruth,\r\n_Geschichte der italienischen Poesie_, 1844-47.--Loise, _Histoire de la\r\nPoésie en Italie_, 1895.--Carducci, _Studi Letterari_, 1880. Valuable\r\ncriticisms on various periods of Italian literature.--An excellent\r\nanthology of the dicta of modern Italian critics has been compiled by\r\nMorandi, _Antologia_, &c., 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\nABRIDGED LITERARY HISTORIES\r\n\r\nEmiliani-Giudici, _Compendia della Storia della Letteratura italiana_,\r\n1855. Very sound, but verbose.--Settembrini, _Lezioni della Letteratura\r\nitaliana_, 1877. Perhaps on the whole the most recommendable of all\r\nthe minor Italian literary histories. The author, an exile lately\r\nrestored to his country, is inspired with a spirit of patriotism which\r\nrenders his work singularly vital and energetic, and the young men to\r\nwhom his lectures are addressed are ever before him. Notwithstanding\r\noccasional paradoxes, his appreciations are in general sound, although\r\nhe is naturally inclined to bear hardly upon authors who fail to attain\r\nhis standard of patriotism.--De Sanctis, _Storia della Letteratura\r\nitaliana_, 1879. Very good, but deficient in the spirit and fire of\r\nSettembrini.--Fenini, _Letteratura italiana_, 1889. The model of\r\nan abbreviated handbook; and the same may be said of its English\r\ncounterpart, Snell’s _Primer of Italian Literature_, 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPULAR POETRY\r\n\r\nRubieri, _Storia della Poesia popolare italiana_, 1877.--D’Ancona,\r\n_La Poesia popolare italiana_, 1878.--Tommaseo, _Canti popolari_,\r\n1841-42.--Tigri, _Canti popolari Toscani_, 1869. See also J. A.\r\nSymonds’s essay in his _Italian Sketches and Studies_, 1879, a new\r\nedition of which is in preparation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREDECESSORS AND CONTEMPORARIES OF DANTE\r\n\r\nRossetti, _Dante and his Circle_, 1893. Consists chiefly of\r\ntranslations of the highest merit. The information it contains is\r\nchiefly derived from Nannucci, _Manuale della Letteratura del primo\r\nSecolo_, 1843; and Trucchi, _Poesie italiane inedite di dugento\r\nautori_, 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\nDANTE\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, as much commentary upon Dante as upon all the\r\nrest of Italian literature put together. The most charming edition,\r\nwhen comment is not needed, is that of Dr. Edward Moore, 1894, where\r\nall Dante’s works are compressed into one small and exquisitely\r\nprinted volume; but few students can dispense with a commentary, and\r\nit is generally advisable to read Dante in a modern Italian edition,\r\nwith notes in that language. Of several excellent editions of this\r\ndescription, the best, perhaps, is Fraticelli’s, 1892. For profound\r\nstudents, Ferrazzi, _Manuale Dantesco_, 1865, and Poletto, _Dizionario\r\nDantesco_, 1885, are indispensable. A similar and not less important\r\nwork in English, by Mr. Paget Toynbee, is now in the press. Of the\r\nnumerous introductions to the _Divine Comedy_, the following may be\r\nrecommended to English readers: Scartazzini, _Companion to Dante_,\r\ntranslated by A. J. Butler, 1895; Symonds, _Introduction to Dante_,\r\n1890; Maria Francesca Rossetti, _A Shadow of Dante_, 1884; Dean Church,\r\n_Dante_, 1878; and A. J. Butler, _Dante_, 1895. Of these, Scartazzini\r\nis the scholar and Dantophilist, Symonds and Butler are the efficient\r\ncritics from the modern point of view, and Miss Rossetti and Dean\r\nChurch represent Dante’s own position. Moore’s _Studies in Dante_, now\r\nin course of publication, and Wicksteed’s _Sermons on Dante_, have a\r\nwider scope than that of an introductory manual. The point of Dante’s\r\ninfluence on posterity has been investigated by Oelsner, _Influence of\r\nDante on Modern Thought_, 1895; and his relation to his own countrymen\r\nis discussed in the third volume of Dean Plumptre’s translation of the\r\n_Divine Comedy_. He is treated from the neo-catholic point of view by\r\nOzanam, _Dante et la Philosophie catholique_, 1845.\r\n\r\nThe best editions of Dante’s lyrical poems, including the very many\r\nfalsely attributed to him, and of his _Vita Nuova_ and other prose\r\nworks, are those by Fraticelli. The best English translation of the\r\n_Vita Nuova_ is Rossetti’s; but other translators (Martin, 1862;\r\nNorton, 1893; Boswell, 1895; and the Austrian translator Federn, 1897)\r\nhave done much more for the illustration of the text. A beautiful work\r\non _Dante, sein Leben und sein Werk, sein Verhältniss zur Kunst und zur\r\nPolitik_, by Franz Xaver Kraus, has just been published in Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETRARCH\r\n\r\nNo authority for Petrarch’s life is equal to his own letters, published\r\ncomplete in the edition of Fracassetti, 1859-63. An English translation\r\nhas been announced. There are recent biographies corresponding to the\r\nrequirements of modern research by Geiger, 1874, and in the first\r\nvolume of Koerting’s _Geschichte der Litteratur Italiens_, 1878.\r\nPetrarch’s position and resources as a scholar have been thoroughly\r\ninvestigated by Pierre de Nolhac, _Pétrarque et l’Humanisme_, 1892.\r\nThe best commentary is Leopardi’s, always printed with the current\r\nFlorentine edition of the _Canzoniere_. The most critical edition is\r\nMestica’s, 1896. The best literary criticism is Zumbini’s _Studi sul\r\nPetrarca_, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOCCACCIO\r\n\r\nKoerting’s life of Boccaccio in the second volume of his _Geschichte_\r\nis the best; and the English reader may consult Symonds, _Giovanni\r\nBoccaccio_, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALIAN NOVEL\r\n\r\nPerhaps the fullest account of the Italian novelists in an English\r\nbook is that in Dunlop’s _History of Fiction_, as edited by Wilson,\r\n1888. See also Papanti, _Catalogo dei Novelieri italiani_, 1871, and\r\nthe notices prefixed to the specimens translated in Thomas Roscoe’s\r\n_Italian Novelists_, 1832.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALIAN DRAMA\r\n\r\nThe fullest accounts of individual Italian dramatists will be found\r\nin Ginguené. The beginning of the Italian drama is investigated by\r\nD’Ancona in his _Origini del Teatro in Italia_, 1891; see also the\r\nvolumes (iv.-vii.) devoted to Italy in Klein’s _Geschichte des Dramas_.\r\nD’Ancona has written a monograph on the _Sacre Rappresentazioni_\r\n(see p. 226). The _Commedia dell’ Arte_ (pp. 305-307) is treated in\r\nScherillo’s monograph with this title, in Maurice Sand’s _Masques et\r\nBouffons_, and in Symonds’s preface to his translation of the memoirs\r\nof Carlo Gozzi, 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\nROMANTIC POETRY\r\n\r\nThis subject is most fully treated in general histories, whether of\r\nItalian or romantic literature. Panizzi’s introduction to his edition\r\nof Boiardo and Ariosto (1831), though in many respects erroneous or\r\nantiquated, deserves attention, as does Ferrario, _Storia ed Analisi\r\ndegli antichi Romanzi di Cavalleria_, 1828-29. Ariosto’s indebtedness\r\nto earlier romancers has been investigated by Rajna, _Le Fonti dell’\r\nOrlando Furioso_. Leigh Hunt’s _Stories from the Italian Poets_ is a\r\ncharming companion to Italian chivalric poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALIAN RENAISSANCE\r\n\r\nThe best view of the Renaissance as a whole is to be obtained from\r\nSymonds’s great work, _The Renaissance in Italy_, 1875-81. A new\r\nedition is in course of issue. Much of this comprehensive book relates\r\nto politics, and much to art; but so complete in the Renaissance\r\nperiod was the interpenetration of all forms of mental activity that\r\nno part of the work is useless for the study of literature. The same\r\nmay be said of almost all modern biographies of leading Italians of the\r\nperiod, of most collections of letters, and of such books as Bisticci’s\r\nmemoirs of his contemporaries (p. 107). A useful abridged account of\r\nthe scholars of the early period of the Renaissance will be found in\r\nVillari’s _Life of Machiavelli_; and authors of later date are noticed\r\nin Roscoe’s _Life of Leo X_. The dissemination of literature upon the\r\ninvention of printing is illustrated by Horatio Brown in his _Venetian\r\nPrinting Press_, 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\nTASSO\r\n\r\nAll previous biographies are superseded by Solerti’s, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\nCrescimbeni, _Vite degl’ Arcadi Illustri_, 1704-13.--Cantù, _L’Abate\r\nParini e la Lombardia nel Secolo XVIII_.--Carducci, _Parini_.--Vernon\r\nLee, _Studies of the Eighteenth Century in Italy_, 1880.

Dealing in 400 pages with a subject which is\r\n  both immense and well worn, Mr. Murray presents us with a treatment\r\n  at once comprehensive, penetrating, and fresh. By dint of a clear,\r\n  freely-moving intelligence, and by dint also of a style at once\r\n  compact and lucid, he has produced a book which fairly represents the\r\n  best conclusions of modern scholarship.”\r\n\r\n  =_The Athenæum._=--“The book is brilliant and stimulating; while its\r\n  freshness of treatment and recognition of the latest German research\r\n  amply justify its existence. Professor Murray has made these old\r\n  Greek bones live.”\r\n\r\n  =_The Saturday Review._=--“Mr. Gosse’s introduction to this new\r\n  series, the list of his collaborators, his own wide knowledge and\r\n  delicate taste, and, finally, the manner in which his first volume\r\n  is executed, all assure us that whatever high hopes he may raise, we\r\n  need have no fear of their ample fulfilment. Mr. Murray’s style is\r\n  vigorous, and, above all, he has the gift of sympathy for the Greek\r\n  spirit. He is distinguished alike for fascination and thoroughness:\r\n  he commands both our confidence and our admiration.”\r\n\r\n  =_The Morning Post._=--“Professor Murray is exceptionally qualified\r\n  to deal with the difficult and important subject of that Greek\r\n  Literature, which he has made a life-long study. His gifts of\r\n  imaginative sympathy with ancient Greece, and his exact knowledge of\r\n  her literature, are distinctly evidenced in this volume. In dealing\r\n  with the tragic poets, with Herodotus, Demosthenes, and the lyric\r\n  poets, Professor Murray has brought to notice much that will prove\r\n  new even to the scholar, and more that will be of interest to the\r\n  general reader.”\r\n\r\n  =_The Scotsman._=--“The book speaks well for the attractions of its\r\n  own subject, and promises well for the series in which it appears.”\r\n\r\n  =_The Daily Chronicle._=--“The writer shows himself well qualified to\r\n  write an illuminating history of Greek Literature, in which learning\r\n  is enlivened and supplemented by literary skill, by a true sense of\r\n  the humanities. The reader feels that this is no book of perfunctory\r\n  erudition, but a labour of love, performed by a scholar, to whom\r\n  ancient Greece and her literature are exceedingly real and vivid. His\r\n  judgments and suggestions are full of a personal, fresh sincerity.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  =_The Glasgow Herald._=--“To competent knowledge of his subject, Mr.\r\n  Murray adds a power of exposition which does not always accompany\r\n  great learning; and, while scholars will here find a fresh and\r\n  well-digested account of all the most recent criticism of the long\r\n  procession of outstanding names in Greek literature, the ordinary\r\n  reader will not be repelled by excessive technicality or too numerous\r\n  details.”\r\n\r\n  =_The St. James’s Gazette._=--“Mr. Gosse is to be congratulated on\r\n  having invited Professor Murray to write the first volume of this\r\n  series. If the other contributors do their work as well, the success\r\n  of the venture is assured. He has done no slight service to the cause\r\n  of real learning as distinguished from superficial culture, and he\r\n  has invested his treatise with a human interest. The book is equally\r\n  solid and attractive, and abounds with happy phrases.”\r\n\r\n  =_The National Observer and British Review._=--“The treatment of\r\n  the Homeric question seems to us masterly, as an indication of\r\n  the results attained by scientific analysis of language and the\r\n  comparative study of early literatures.... For scholars and lovers of\r\n  Greek, Professor Murray’s summary but penetrating criticism will have\r\n  the charm that is always exercised by a powerful and original mind\r\n  discoursing on subjects delightful to the listener.”\r\n\r\n  =_The Speaker._=--“Vigour and freshness, great learning and\r\n  independence of judgment, are the salient characteristics of Mr.\r\n  Murray’s book. He has produced a work which, while it puts the\r\n  English student abreast of all the latest work in classical research,\r\n  may be read with pleasure by those who have not carried their\r\n  classical studies beyond the point they reached at school.”\r\n\r\n  =_A. T. Q. C. in the Speaker._=--“Mr. Heinemann and Mr. Gosse have\r\n  made a brilliant start in this Series. To condense into some 400\r\n  boldly printed pages a story which is not only vast and intricate in\r\n  itself, but has been complicated by the discussions and theories of\r\n  more than two thousand years, and to do this without ignoring those\r\n  discussions and theories, must have been a daunting task. Mr. Murray\r\n  has accomplished it, and an even more difficult feat. He has written\r\n  an eminently readable book.”\r\n\r\n  =_The Pall Mall Gazette._=--“A really quite admirable book. It is\r\n  full of learning, but the learning is never obtruded. Then, too, it\r\n  is full of humour, not exactly racy epigram, but felicitous phrases.\r\n  The style, indeed, is not the least attractive part of the book. We\r\n  must also say a word of praise for the translated extracts throughout\r\n  the book. They are finely selected, accurately rendered, and clothed\r\n  in really thrilling English.”\r\n\r\n  =_The Journal of Education._=--“The series starts _felici omine_. No\r\n  brighter or more readable account of a subject so immense as Greek\r\n  literature has, to our knowledge, ever been published in English than\r\n  Professor Murray’s volume.... This delightful book should be of great\r\n  service.”\r\n\r\n  =_The Spectator._=--“Professor Murray soon convinces his readers that\r\n  he is equal to his subject, has something fresh to say about it, and\r\n  is able to say it with a quite uncommon vigour. In power of sympathy\r\n  he surpasses, we think, all his predecessors. We have seldom found a\r\n  book that has given us more pleasure than this.”\r\n\r\n  =_The Standard._=--“Professor Murray does all the justice which is\r\n  possible in the compass of 400 pages, to a subject so vast, subtle,\r\n  and many-sided. He has written a lucid and fascinating sketch of the\r\n  men and movements that shaped in prose and poetry the most splendid\r\n  and influential literary bequest of antiquity. The method of the\r\n  book is to realise what sort of men the Greek poets, historians,\r\n  orators, and philosophers were, and to describe them in their habit\r\n  as they lived. The book abounds in fresh and vigorous thought, and\r\n  independence of judgment.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Literatures of the World\r\n\r\n                     Edited by EDMUND GOSSE, M.A.\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n                    A History of French Literature\r\n\r\n                    By Edward Dowden, D.C.L., LL.D.\r\n\r\n              Professor of Oratory and English Literature\r\n                      in the University of Dublin\r\n\r\n                   Large crown 8vo, cloth extra, 6s.\r\n\r\n  =_The Athenæum._=--“Mr. Dowden has condensed a remarkable amount\r\n  of carefully formed judgments into his 400 pages. He has done it\r\n  with so honest an intelligence that we can trust him alike when\r\n  he writes of Rabelais and when he writes of Fénelon.... The book\r\n  gives us a clearer and a more sympathetic notion of the spirit of\r\n  French writers than any book, certainly which has been written\r\n  in English.... Mr. Dowden is for the most part so just, because,\r\n  whatever his personal preferences, he possesses pre-eminently a sane\r\n  enthusiasm for literature as literature. Looking at literature as the\r\n  self-expression of humanity, he is most attracted by those writers in\r\n  whom what is called the human element is strongest.... Where his book\r\n  is most valuable, most corrective of much that is unduly academic in\r\n  the professional treatment of literature, is that he has realised\r\n  literature in this living way, as being itself so living a thing....\r\n  A book which is certainly the best history of French Literature in\r\n  the English language.”\r\n\r\n  =_The Saturday Review._=--“This is a history of literature as\r\n  histories of literature should be written. From beginning to end of\r\n  this book, in which French Literature is chronicled from the Middle\r\n  Ages to the end of the first half of the nineteenth century, there is\r\n  not a page in which the writer is not seen successfully endeavouring\r\n  to understand, sympathise with, and truthfully interpret writer after\r\n  writer, Rabelais, Calvin, Victor Hugo.... His style has the singular\r\n  merit of being a living voice, speaking to us with gravity and\r\n  enthusiasm about the writers of many ages, and of being a human voice\r\n  always.... Seeing sharply, definitely, he sees widely; and that moral\r\n  quality, whose importance in literature he is so well aware of, gives\r\n  to his own writing a grasp on realities, on what is essential in a\r\n  man’s expression of himself, which the historian of literature but\r\n  rarely possesses.... The more closely one looks into this book, the\r\n  more clearly is it seen how much thought, how much mental selection,\r\n  as well as how much reading, have gone to the making of these\r\n  picturesque portraits of writers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Literatures of the World\r\n\r\n                     Edited by EDMUND GOSSE, M.A.\r\n\r\n                                 III.\r\n                             A History of\r\n                       Modern English Literature\r\n\r\n                                  By\r\n\r\n                             Edmund Gosse\r\n\r\n                Hon. M.A. of Trinity College, Cambridge\r\n\r\n                   Large crown 8vo, cloth extra, 6s.\r\n\r\n  =_Athenæum._=--“The author has succeeded in giving a really useful\r\n  account of the whole process of evolution in English letters--an\r\n  account based upon a keen sense at once of the unity of his subject\r\n  and of the rhythm of its ebb and flow; and illumined by an unexampled\r\n  felicity in hitting off the leading characteristics of individual\r\n  writers, ”placing“ them critically in a few graceful lines. As a\r\n  whole the book is full of insight and serenity of judgment.”\r\n\r\n  =_Literature._=--“Mr. Gosse possesses a rare power of giving adequacy\r\n  even to his most summarised accounts of literary work, and his most\r\n  rapid sketches of literary figures. He is always master of the vivid,\r\n  picturesque, or humorous phrase which lives in the memory, and\r\n  imprints on it the personality of the author, whom it depicts with a\r\n  stroke. This 'History of Modern English Literature’ is a work which\r\n  will not only serve its purpose in the class-room, but is eminently\r\n  worthy of a place of honour in the library.”\r\n\r\n  =_Saturday Review._=--“It is difficult to be too thankful to a\r\n  historian who judges everything from the strictly literary point\r\n  of view, to whom the word history really means a tracing of the\r\n  continuous life of literature, and to whom the historian himself is a\r\n  person to be kept rigorously out of sight.”\r\n\r\n  =_Times._=--“Mr. Gosse’s most ambitious book, and probably his best.\r\n  It bears on every page the traces of wide reading, of a genuine love\r\n  for his subject, and of a lively critical intelligence. Moreover, it\r\n  is extremely readable--more readable, in fact, than any other single\r\n  volume dealing with the subject that we can call to mind. The picture\r\n  given is in the main true to life, and it is painted with extreme\r\n  dexterity.”\r\n\r\n  =_Daily Chronicle._=--“Mr. Gosse has been remarkably successful in\r\n  bringing into focus and proportion the salient features of his vast\r\n  and varied theme. We have read the book, not only with pleasure,\r\n  but with a singular emotion. The very rapidity with which the\r\n  majestic procession of names passed in review, brought home to us\r\n  with peculiar vividness the greatness of the phenomenon comprised in\r\n  the words ”English Literature.“ Mr. Gosse’s criticism is generally\r\n  sympathetic, but at the same time it is always sober.”\r\n\r\n  =_Daily Graphic._=--“Mr. Gosse is a careful student and skilful\r\n  critic; he knows the subject as well as any one, and he knows how to\r\n  write something better than a school-book. We wish we could help our\r\n  readers to enjoy to the full this most delightful book, which every\r\n  one should read from beginning to end.”\r\n\r\n  =_St. James’s Gazette._=--“Certainly one of the most valuable as well\r\n  as one of the most interesting books of its kind.”\r\n\r\n  =_Academy._=--“A book that is interesting in every paragraph.”\r\n\r\n  =_Manchester Guardian._=--“Animation, sympathy, proportion, govern\r\n  the book throughout. Alike in his treatment of individuals and in\r\n  his firm hold of the main threads of his story, the author shows his\r\n  mastery of the art of weaving a history.”\r\n\r\n  =_Glasgow Herald._=--“This brilliant book gives a new value and\r\n  distinction to the series. Mr. Gosse’s critical taste and skill have\r\n  never been better exemplified. The book is a fine and solid piece of\r\n  work.”\r\n\r\n  =_Manchester Courier._=--“An interesting body of criticism\r\n  unsurpassed in its sanity, luminousness, and sense of proportion,\r\n  expressed with a directness and clearness which render it all the\r\n  more valuable, and with a felicity which gives it a charm, rarely\r\n  associated with handbooks of literature.”\r\n\r\n  =_Globe._=--“It is wonderful that Mr. Gosse should have been able\r\n  to get so much fact as well as thought into a space comparatively so\r\n  small. We have here, in effect, the cream of the author’s meditations\r\n  on the wide field of English literature.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          The Great Educators\r\n\r\n _A Series of Volumes by Eminent Writers, presenting in their entirety\r\n                “A Biographical History of Education”_\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  I.\r\n\r\n            Aristotle, and the Ancient Educational Ideals.\r\n               By THOMAS DAVIDSON, M.A., LL.D. Price 5s.\r\n\r\n  =_Times._=--“Dr. Davidson, 'by tracing the whole history of Greek\r\n  Education up to Aristotle and down from Aristotle, to show the past\r\n  which conditioned his theories, and the future which was conditioned\r\n  by them,’ produces a very readable sketch of a very interesting\r\n  subject.”\r\n\r\n  =_Saturday Review._=--“It is well written and interesting, and, while\r\n  making no vain display of learning, shows a thorough acquaintance\r\n  with its subject.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\n          Loyola, and the Educational System of the Jesuits.\r\n                 By Rev. THOMAS HUGHES, S.J. Price 5s.\r\n\r\n  =_Saturday Review._=--“This volume will probably be welcomed by\r\n  others besides those specially interested in the theories and methods\r\n  of education. Written by a member of the Jesuit Society, it comes to\r\n  us with authority, and presents a complete and well-arranged survey\r\n  of the work.... If a schoolmaster would learn how the education of\r\n  the young can be carried on so as to confer real dignity on those\r\n  engaged in it, we recommend him to read Mr. Hughes’s book, and\r\n  ponder not merely the wisdom contained in the Ratio, but on the\r\n  self-sacrifice it requires from the Jesuit teacher.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 III.\r\n\r\n            Alcuin, and the Rise of the Christian Schools.\r\n            By Professor ANDREW F. WEST, Ph.D. Price 5s.\r\n\r\n  =_Times._=--“Professor West’s monograph is a valuable contribution,\r\n  based upon original and independent study, to our knowledge of an\r\n  obscure but important period in the history of European learning and\r\n  education.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV.\r\n\r\n               Froebel, and Education by Self-Activity.\r\n                 By H. COURTHOPE BOWEN, M.A. Price 5s.\r\n\r\n  =_Pall Mall Gazette._=--“The gratitude of all who have to do with the\r\n  teaching of the young is due to Mr. Courthope Bowen for his account\r\n  of Froebel’s life and the development of his system of teaching. This\r\n  book repays careful reading, and we believe that no one having to do\r\n  with the education of children can but be benefited by its perusal.”\r\n\r\n  =_Guardian._=--“It is the most satisfactory account of the great\r\n  educator in any language.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  V.\r\n\r\n      Abelard, and the Origin and Early History of Universities.\r\n   By GABRIEL COMPAYRÉ, Rector of the Academy of Poictiers. Price 5s.\r\n\r\n  =_Pall Mall Gazette._=--“M. Compayré gives an admirable description\r\n  of the origin and early development of the universities: of their\r\n  organisation and method of graduation, of the course of study in the\r\n  different faculties, and of the manners of students and masters.”\r\n\r\n  =_Standard._=--“M. Compayré does justice to this magnetic\r\n  knight-errant of philosophy, who never spared himself either in the\r\n  quest or exposition of knowledge, and he also describes the rise of\r\n  the universities of Paris, Bologna, Oxford, and Salamanca.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI.\r\n\r\n                     Herbart and the Herbartians.\r\n                 By CHARLES DE GARMO, Ph.D. Price 5s.\r\n\r\n  =_Guardian._=--“Dr. de Garmo has written his book in an attractive\r\n  style, and his treatise is a useful contribution to the literature of\r\n  his subject.”\r\n\r\n  =_Academy._=--“Dr. de Garmo has done real service to education in\r\n  writing this book, and he deserves warm thanks for supplying the\r\n  English reader with a clear and attractive account of Herbart.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VII.\r\n\r\n Thomas and Matthew Arnold, and their Influence on English Education.\r\n By Sir JOSHUA FITCH, M.A., LL.D., formerly Her Majesty’s Inspector of\r\n                     Training Colleges. Price 5s.\r\n\r\n  =_Educational Times._=--“A book written with all a craftsman’s skill,\r\n  a book in which the conspicuous educational wants of this century are\r\n  described with that warmth of soul, and that clear-headedness as to\r\n  the issues involved, which we always look for in Sir Joshua Fitch,\r\n  and never look for in vain. We feel that a real service has been\r\n  done to educational politics; for whosoever will read it--teacher or\r\n  layman--will be taken to a plane of thought which is above parties.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VIII.\r\n\r\n   Horace Mann, and the Common School Revival in the United States.\r\n By B.
