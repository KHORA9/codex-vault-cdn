Mark Pattison’s\r\naphorism that “history is one of the most ephemeral forms of\r\nliterature” has much of truth in it. The reasons of this are not far\r\nto seek. In the first place, the most laborious historian is doomed to\r\nbe superseded in course of time by the accumulation of new material.\r\nIn the second place, the point of view and the interpretation of one\r\ngeneration varies from that which preceded it, so that each generation\r\nrequires a rewriting of history in terms of its own interest.\r\n\r\nThese reasons must be my excuse for venturing to write a new book upon\r\nan old subject. It is now nearly thirty years since the appearance\r\nof the late Professor Henry M. Baird’s excellent work, _The Rise of\r\nthe Huguenots_ (New York, 1879), and little that is comprehensive has\r\nsince been written upon the subject in English, with the exception\r\nof Mr. A. W. Whitehead’s admirable _Gaspard de Coligny, Admiral of\r\nFrance_ (London, 1904). But the limitations imposed by biographical\r\nhistory compel an author inevitably to ignore movements or events not\r\ngermane to his immediate subject, which, nevertheless, may be of great\r\nimportance for general history. Moreover, a biography is limited by the\r\nterm of life of the hero, and his death may not by any means terminate\r\nthe issue in which he was a factor—as indeed was the case with Coligny.\r\n\r\nAn enumeration of the notable works—sources and authorities—which\r\nhave been published since the appearance of Professor Baird’s work\r\nmay serve to justify the present volume. First and foremost must be\r\nmentioned the notable _Lettres de Catherine de Médicis_, the lack of\r\nwhich Ranke deplored, edited by the late Count Hector de la Ferrière\r\nand M. Baguenault de la Puchesse (9 vols.), the initial volume of\r\nwhich appeared in 1880. Of diplomatic correspondence we have the\r\n_Ambassade en Espagne de Jean Ebrard, seigneur de St. Sulpice de 1562\r\nà 1565_ (Paris, 1902), edited by M. Edmond Cabié, and thé _Dépêches de\r\nM. Fourquevaux, ambassadeur du roi Charles IX en Espagne, 1565-72_,\r\nin three volumes, edited by the Abbé Douais (Paris, 1896). Other\r\nsources which have seen the light within the last three decades are\r\nM. Delaborde’s _Vie de Coligny_ (3 vols., 1877-), the title of which\r\nis somewhat misleading, for it is really a collection of Coligny’s\r\nletters strung upon the thread of his career; the Baron Alphonse de\r\nRuble’s _Antoine de Bourbon et Jeanne d’Albret_ (4 vols., 1881); M.\r\nLudovic Lalanne’s new annotated edition of _D’Aubigné_ (1886), and\r\nthe new edition of Beza’s _Histoire ecclésiastique_ (ed. of Baum,\r\n1883). Finally, among sources should be included many volumes in the\r\n“Calendar of State Papers.” Professor Baird has rightly said that “Too\r\nmuch weight can scarcely be given to this source of information and\r\nillustration.” His praise would probably have been even greater if he\r\ncould have used the correspondence of Dale and Smith as freely as he\r\ndid that of Throckmorton and Norris.\r\n\r\nWhen we pass from sources to authorities the list of notable works\r\nis even longer. La Ferrière’s _Le XVI^[e] siècle et les Valois_—the\r\nfruit of researches in the Record Office in London—appeared in 1879;\r\nM. Forneron’s _Histoire de Philippe II_ (4 vols.) was published in\r\n1887, and is even more valuable than his earlier _Histoire des ducs de\r\nGuise_ (1877). Besides these, in the decade of the 80’s, are Durier’s\r\n_Les Huguenots en Bigorre_ (1884); Communay’s _Les Huguenots dans le\r\nBéarn et la Navarre_ (1886); Lettenhove’s _Les Huguenots et les Gueux_\r\n(1885); the baron de Ruble’s _Le traité de Cateau-Cambrésis_ (1889),\r\nand the abbé Marchand’s _Charles de Cossé, Comte de Brissac_ (1889).\r\nM. de Crue’s notable _Anne, duc de Montmorency_ appeared in the same\r\nyear and his no less scholarly _Le parti des politiques au lendemain\r\nde Saint Barthélemy_ three years later. M. Marlet’s _Le comte de\r\nMontgomery_ was published in 1890; M. Georges Weill’s _Les théories\r\nsur le pouvoir royal en France pendant les guerres de religion_, in\r\n1891; M. Henri Hauser’s _François de La Noue_ in 1892; M. Bernard de\r\nLacombe’s _Catherine de Médicis entre Guise et Condé_ in 1899, and,\r\nmost recently of all, M. Courteault’s _Blaise de Montluc_ (1908).\r\nMany contributions in the _Revue historique_, the _Revue des questions\r\nhistoriques_, the _English Historical Review_, the _Revue d’histoire\r\ndiplomatique_, the _Revue des deux mondes_, and one article in the\r\n_American Historical Review_, January, 1903, by M. Hauser, “The\r\nReformation and the Popular Classes in the Sixteenth Century,” are\r\nequally valuable, as the notes will show. I have also consulted many\r\narticles in the proceedings of various local or provincial historical\r\nsocieties, as the Société de Paris et de l’Ile de France; the Société\r\nde l’histoire de Normandie, the Société d’histoire et d’archéologie de\r\nGenève, etc., and the admirable series known as the _Bulletin de la\r\nSociété du protestantisme français_, which is a mine of historical lore.\r\n\r\nWhile the present work falls in the epoch of the French Reformation,\r\nno attempt has been made to treat that subject in so far as\r\nthe Reformation is assumed primarily to have been a religious\r\nmanifestation. Doctrine, save when it involved polity, has been\r\nignored. But into the political, diplomatic, and economic activities of\r\nthe period I have tried to go at some length. As to the last feature,\r\nit is not too much to say that our interpretation of the sixteenth\r\ncentury has been profoundly changed within the last twenty years by the\r\nprogress made in economic history. Such works as Weiss’s _La chambre\r\nardente_ and Hauser’s _Ouvriers du temps passé_ have revolutionized the\r\ntreatment of this subject.\r\n\r\nSuch an interpretation is merely a reflection of our own present-day\r\ninterest in economic and social problems. In this particular it is the\r\nwriter’s belief that he is the first to present some of the results of\r\nrecent research into the economic history of sixteenth-century France\r\nto English readers. My indebtedness to M. Hauser is especially great\r\nfor the help and suggestion he has given me in the matter of industrial\r\nhistory. But I have tried to widen the subject and attempted to show\r\nthe bearing of changes in the agricultural régime, the influence of\r\nthe failure of crops owing to adverse weather conditions, and the\r\ndisintegration of society as the result of incessant war and the\r\nplague, upon the progress of the Huguenot movement. In an agricultural\r\ncountry like France in the sixteenth century, the distress of the\r\nprovinces through the failure of the harvests was sometimes nearly\r\nuniversal, and the retroactive effect of such conditions in promoting\r\npopular discontent had a marked influence upon the religious and\r\npolitical issues.\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out that “the religious wars of France furnish\r\nthe most complete instance of the constant intersection of native and\r\nforeign influences.”[1] The bearing of the Huguenot movement upon\r\nSpanish and Dutch history was intimate and marked, and this I have also\r\nattempted to set forth. In so doing the fact that has impressed me\r\nmost of all is the development and activity of the provincial Catholic\r\nleagues and their close connection with Spain’s great Catholic machine\r\nin France, the Holy League.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Holy League in France is usually represented as\r\nhaving extended from 1576 to 1594. This time was the period of its\r\ngreatest activity and of its greatest power. But institutions do not\r\nspring to life full armed in a moment, like Athené from the head of\r\nZeus. “The roots of the present lie deep in the past,” as Bishop Stubbs\r\nobserved. Institutions are a growth, a development. The Holy League was\r\na movement of slow growth and development, although it has not been\r\nthus represented, and resulted from the combination of various acts\r\nand forces—political, diplomatic, religious, economic, social, even\r\npsychological—working simultaneously both within and without France\r\nduring the civil wars. I have tried to set forth the nature and extent\r\nof these forces; to show how they originated; how they operated; and\r\nhow they ultimately were combined to form the Holy League. Certain\r\nindividual features of the history here covered have been treated in an\r\nisolated way by some writers. The late baron de Ruble and M. Forneron\r\nhave disclosed the treasonable negotiations of Montluc with Philip II.\r\nM. Bouillé and more recently M. Forneron have followed the tortuous\r\nthread of the cardinal of Lorraine’s secret negotiations with Spain.\r\nVarious historians, chiefly in provincial histories or biographies\r\nlike Pingaud’s _Les Saulx-Tavannes_, have noticed the local work of\r\nsome of the provincial Catholic associations. But the relation of all\r\nthese various movements, one to the other, and their ultimate fusion\r\ninto a single united movement has not yet been fully brought out.\r\nWhat was the number and form of organization of these local Catholic\r\nleagues? What influenced their combination? What bearing did they\r\nhave upon the course of Montluc and the cardinal of Lorraine? Or upon\r\nPhilip II’s policy? How did the great feud between the Guises and the\r\nMontmorencys influence the formation of the Holy League and its hostile\r\ncounterpart—the Association of the Huguenots and the Politiques? These\r\nquestions I have tried to answer and in so doing two or three new\r\nfacts have been brought to light. For example, an undiscovered link\r\nin the history of the Guises’ early secret intercourse with Philip II\r\nhas been found in the conduct of L’Aubespine, the French ambassador in\r\nSpain in 1561; the treasonable course of the cardinal of Lorraine, it\r\nis shown, began in 1565 instead of 1566, a fact which makes the petty\r\nconflict known as the “Cardinal’s War” of new importance; the history\r\nof the Catholic associations in the provinces, hitherto isolated in\r\nmany separate volumes, has been woven into the whole and some new\r\ninformation established regarding them.[2]\r\n\r\nThe notes, it is hoped, will sufficiently indicate the sources used and\r\nenable the reader to test the treatment of the subject, or guide him to\r\nsources by which he may form his own judgment if desired.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of maps, the very complete apparatus of maps in Mr.\r\nWhitehead’s _Gaspard de Coligny, Admiral of France_, has greatly\r\nlightened my task, and I express my cordial thanks to Mr. Whitehead\r\nand Messrs. Methuen & Co., his publishers, for permission to reproduce\r\nthose in that work. My thanks are also due to M. Ch. de Coynart and MM.\r\nFirmin Didot et Cie for permission to reproduce the map illustrating\r\nthe battle of Dreux from the late Commandant de Coynart’s work entitled\r\n_L’Année 1562 et la bataille de Dreux_; and to M. Steph. C. Gigon,\r\nauthor of _La bataille de Jarnac et la campagne de 1569 en Angoumois_,\r\nfor permission to use his two charts of the battle of Jarnac. Those\r\nillustrating the Tour of the Provinces in 1564-66, the march of the\r\nduke of Alva and Montgomery’s great raid in Gascony are my own. Some\r\nlesser maps and illustrations are from old prints which I have gathered\r\ntogether, in the course of years, except that illustrating the siege of\r\nHavre-de-Grace and the large picture of the battle of St. Denis, which\r\nhave been photographed from the originals in the Record Office.\r\n\r\nDuring the preparation of this volume, which has entailed two prolonged\r\nvisits to Paris and other parts of France, and to London, I have\r\nbecome the debtor to many persons. Among those of whose courtesy and\r\nassistance I would make special acknowledgment are the following: His\r\nExcellency, M. Jean-Jules Jusserand, French ambassador at Washington;\r\nM. Henri Vignaud, chargé d’affaires of the American legation in Paris;\r\nMM. Charles de la Roncière and Viennot of the Bibliothèque Nationale;\r\nMM. Le Grand and Viard of the Archives Nationales, where I chiefly\r\nworked in the K. Collection. At the Record Office, Mr. Hubert Hall and\r\nhis assistant, Miss Mary Trice Martin, were unfailing in the aid given\r\nme. For the transcript of the “Discorso sopra gli humori del Regno di\r\nFrancia,” from the Barberini Library in Rome, I am indebted to P. Franz\r\nEhrle, prefect of the Vatican archives. I also hold in grateful memory\r\nthe friendship and assistance of the late Woodbury Lowery, author\r\nof _The Spanish Settlements within the Present Limits of the United\r\nStates: Florida_ (1562-74), New York, 1905, with whom I was a fellow\r\nworker at the Archives Nationales in the spring and early summer of\r\n1903.\r\n\r\nFinally, I owe much to the suggestive criticism of my friend and\r\ncolleague, Professor Ferdinand Schevill, and my friends, Professor\r\nHerbert Darling Foster, of Dartmouth College, and Professor Roger B.\r\nMerriman, of Harvard University, each of whom has read much of the\r\nmanuscript.\r\n\r\n  JAMES WESTFALL THOMPSON\r\n\r\n  THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO\r\n  January 1909\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\n  LIST OF MAPS AND PLATES                                             xv\r\n\r\n CHAPTER\r\n\r\n      I.

THE CONSPIRACY OF AMBOISE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last day of June, 1559, was a gala day in Paris. The marriages\r\nof Philip II of Spain with Elizabeth of France, daughter of King\r\nHenry II and Catherine de Medici, and that of the French King’s\r\nsister, Marguerite with Emanuel Philibert, duke of Savoy, were to be\r\ncelebrated. But “the torches of joy became funeral tapers”[3] before\r\nnightfall, for Henry II was mortally wounded in the tournament given\r\nin honor of the occasion.[4] It was the rule that challengers, in this\r\ncase the King, should run three courses and their opponents one. The\r\nthird contestant of the King had been Gabriel, sieur de Lorges, better\r\nknown as the count of Montgomery, captain of the Scotch Guard,[5] a\r\nyoung man, “grand et roidde,” whom Henry rechallenged because his\r\npride was hurt that he had not better kept his seat in the saddle in\r\nthe first running. Montgomery tried to refuse, but the King silenced\r\nhis objections with a command and reluctantly[6] Montgomery resumed\r\nhis place. But this time the Scotch guardsman failed to cast away the\r\ntrunk of the splintered lance as he should have done at the moment of\r\nthe shock, and the fatal accident followed. The jagged point crashed\r\nthrough the King’s visor into the right eye.[7] For a minute Henry\r\nreeled in his saddle, but by throwing his arms around the neck of his\r\nhorse, managed to keep his seat. The King’s armor was stripped from him\r\nat once and “a splint taken out of good bigness.”[8] He moved neither\r\nhand nor foot, and lay as if benumbed or paralyzed,[9] and so was\r\ncarried to his chamber in the Tournelles,[10] entrance being denied to\r\nall save physicians, apothecaries, and those valets-de-chambre who were\r\non duty. None were permitted for a great distance to come near until\r\nlate in the day, when the duke of Alva, who was to be proxy for his\r\nsovereign at the marriage, the duke of Savoy, the prince of Orange, the\r\ncardinal of Lorraine, and the constable were admitted.[11]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTGOMERY IN TOURNAMENT COSTUME\r\n\r\n(Bib. Nat., Estampes, _Hist. de France_, reg. Q. b. 19)]\r\n\r\nAfter the first moment of consternation was past, it was thought that\r\nthe King would recover, though losing the sight of his eye,[12] since\r\non the fourth day Henry recovered his senses and his fever was abated.\r\nMeanwhile five or six of the ablest physicians in France had been\r\ndiligently experimenting upon the heads of four criminals who were\r\ndecapitated for the purpose in the Conciergerie and the prisons of\r\nthe Châtelet. On the eighth day Vesalius, Philip II’s physician, who\r\nhad long been with the emperor Charles V, and who enjoyed a European\r\nreputation, arrived and took special charge of the royal patient.[13]\r\nIn the interval of consciousness Henry commanded that the interrupted\r\nmarriages be solemnized. Before they were celebrated the King had lost\r\nthe use of speech and lapsed into unconsciousness, and on the morrow\r\nof the marriages he died (July 10, 1559). On August 13 the corpse was\r\ninterred at St. Denis.[14] When the ceremony was ended the king of arms\r\nstood up, and after twice pronouncing the words “Le roi est mort,” he\r\nturned around toward the assembly, and the third time cried out: “Vive\r\nle roi, très-chretien François le deuzième de ce nom, par la grace de\r\nDieu, roi de France.” Thereupon the trumpets sounded and the interment\r\nwas ended.[15] A month later, on September 18, Francis II was crowned\r\nat Rheims. Already Montgomery had been deprived of the captaincy of\r\nthe Scotch Guard and his post given to “a mere Frenchman,” much to the\r\nindignation of the members of the Guard.[16]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEATHBED OF HENRY II\r\n\r\n  A. Catherine de Medici            D. Couriers\r\n  B. Cardinal of Lorraine           E. Courtiers\r\n  C. Constable Montmorency          F. Physicians]\r\n\r\nThe reign of Henry II had not been a popular one. He had neither the\r\nmind nor the application necessary in public affairs.[17] On the\r\nvery day of the accident the English ambassador wrote to Cecil: “It\r\nis a marvel to see how the noblemen, gentlemen, and ladies do lament\r\nthis misfortune, and contrary-wise, how the townsmen and people do\r\nrejoice.”[18] The wars of Henry II in Italy and in the Low Countries\r\nhad drained France of blood and treasure, so that the purses of the\r\npeople were depleted by an infinity of exactions and confiscations;\r\noffices and benefices had been bartered, even those of justice, and\r\nto make the feeling of the people worse, Henry II was prodigal to\r\nhis favorites.[19] Finally the treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis (1559) was\r\nregarded as not less disadvantageous than dishonorable.[20]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile much politics had been in progress.[21] The new king was not\r\nyet sixteen years of age.[22] He was of frail health and insignificant\r\nintellect, being quite unlike his wife, the beautiful and brilliant\r\nMary Stuart, who was a niece of the Guises, Francis, duke of Guise,\r\nand his brother Charles, cardinal of Lorraine, who had been in no\r\nsmall favor under Henry II. Even in the king’s lifetime the ambition\r\nof the Guises had been a thing of wonderment and his unexpected death\r\nopened before them the prospect of new and prolonged power. Henry II\r\nhad scarcely closed his eyes when the duke of Guise and the cardinal of\r\nLorraine took possession of the person of Francis II and conducted him\r\nto the Louvre, in company with the queen-mother, ignoring the princes\r\nof the blood, the marshals, the admiral of France, and “many Knights\r\nof the Order, or grand seigneurs who were not of their retinue.” There\r\nthey deliberated without permitting anyone to approach, still less\r\nto speak to the King except in the presence of one of them. Francis\r\nII gave out that his uncles were to manage his affairs.[23] In order\r\nto give color to this assumption of authority, as if their intention\r\nwas to restore everything to good estate again, the Guises recalled\r\nthe chancellor Olivier, who had been driven from office by Diane de\r\nPoitiers, Henry II’s mistress.[24]\r\n\r\nEven before these events the Guises had shown their hand, for on the\r\nday of Henry II’s decease the constable, the cardinal Châtillon and his\r\nbrother, the admiral Coligny, had been appointed to attend upon the\r\nroyal corse at the Tournelles, by which maneuver they were excluded\r\nfrom all active work and the way was cleared for the unhampered rule\r\nof the King’s uncles. Rumor prevailed that D’Andelot, the third of the\r\nfamous Châtillon brothers, was to be dismissed from the command of\r\nthe footmen and the place be given to the count de Rochefoucauld.[25]\r\nBefore the end of the month the duke of Guise was given charge of the\r\nwar office and the cardinal of Lorraine that of finance and matters of\r\nstate.[26] At the same time, on various pretexts, the princes of the\r\nblood were sent away,[27] the prince of Condé to Flanders, ostensibly\r\nto confer with Philip II regarding the peace of Cateau-Cambrésis,[28]\r\nthe prince of La Roche-sur-Yon and the cardinal Bourbon to conduct\r\nElizabeth of France into Spain, so that by November “there remained\r\nno more princes with the King save those of Guise,”[29] who had\r\ninfluential agents in the two marshals, St. André[30] and Brissac.[31]\r\n\r\nMuch depended upon the attitude of Antoine of Bourbon, sieur de\r\nVendôme and king of Navarre, who was first prince of the blood, and\r\nthe person to whom the direction of affairs would naturally fall. At\r\nthe time of Henry II’s death he was in Béarn, whither La Mare, the\r\nKing’s valet-de-chambre, was sent to notify him,[32] the Guises having\r\nshrewdly arranged to have the ground cleared of the opposition of the\r\nBourbons and Châtillons when he should arrive.[33]\r\n\r\nBut not all the opposition had been overcome. While Henry II had been\r\ngenerous to the Guises, he had been even fonder of the constable\r\nMontmorency, a bluff, hearty man of war, who became the royal favorite\r\nupon the fall of the admiral Hennebault, after the death of Francis\r\nI.[34] Montmorency was the uncle of the three Châtillons, Odet, the\r\ncardinal-bishop of Beauvais, Gaspard, the admiral Coligny, and François\r\nde Châtillon, sieur d’Andelot, and the King was openly accused of\r\nhaving made a disadvantageous peace in order to protect the constable\r\nand secure the ransom of Coligny, who was captured at the battle of\r\nSt. Quentin.[35] In order to prevent the constable and the king of\r\nNavarre from meeting one another and concerting an arrangement, the\r\nGuises contrived Montmorency’s summary dismissal from court,[36]\r\nFrancis II at their instigation sending him word to retire at once\r\n(August 15). The old war-dog[37] took the affront gallantly, and like\r\nan artful courtier said that he was glad to be relieved of active\r\nduties on account of his age.[38] In the absence of the princes of the\r\nblood, the opposition to the Guises gathered around Montmorency and\r\nthe Châtillons, the faction for a short time taking its name from the\r\nconstable’s title, being known as “connestablistes.”[39] The political\r\nline of division was drawn very sharply, and the growing influence\r\nof Huguenot teachings gave it a religious accentuation as well. The\r\nless significant portion of the noblesse was inclined to repose after\r\nthe long wars and was indifferent to politics; but the upper nobility\r\nwere eager partisans, either having hopes of preferment or being, in\r\nprinciple, opposed both to the usurpation and the religious intolerance\r\nof the Guises.[40]\r\n\r\nAs to the clergy, its members almost without exception were supporters\r\nof the faith and the government of the Guises. The mass of the people\r\nas yet were disregarded by both factions, but were soon to come\r\nforward into prominence for financial and other reasons.[41] Henry\r\nII, unlike his father, had never suffered French Protestantism to\r\nflourish,[42] but, on the contrary, had undertaken rigorous repressive\r\nmeasures. The edicts of Paris (1549), of Fontainebleau (1550), and of\r\nChateaubriand (1551), made the Huguenots[43] subject to both secular\r\nand ecclesiastical tribunals.\r\n\r\nThe Protestant issue was both a religious and a political one, for to\r\nmany men it seemed impossible to alter the religious beliefs of the\r\ntime without destruction of the state. Francis I recognized this state\r\nof things in the rhymed aphorism:\r\n\r\n  Un roi\r\n  Une loi\r\n  Une foi\r\n\r\nand his son rigidly sustained the dictum. The Edict of Compiègne, of\r\nJuly 24, 1557[44] imposed the death penalty upon those who publicly or\r\nsecretly professed a religion other than the Catholic apostolic faith;\r\nthe preamble declaring that “to us alone who have received from the\r\nhand of God the administration of the public affairs of our realm,”\r\nclearly shows the intimate relation of the French state and the French\r\nchurch. It is significant that the _Chambre ardente_ was established to\r\nprosecute the Huguenots in Henry II’s reign.[45]\r\n\r\nEver since the duke of Alva had been in Paris the impression had\r\nprevailed that Henry II and Philip II purposed to establish the\r\nInquisition in France,[46] and that the project had been foiled by the\r\nFrench king’s sudden death. The Huguenots were convinced of it and keen\r\npoliticians like the prince of Orange and Count Egmont taxed Granvella\r\nwith the purpose in 1561.[47] What the government did do has been\r\ncarefully stated by another:\r\n\r\n The Government largely increased the powers of the Ecclesiastical\r\n Courts, and, _pari passu_, detracted from those of the regular Law\r\n Courts called the Parlements. The Parlement of Paris protested\r\n not only against the infringement of its privileges, but against\r\n conversion by persecution, and the same feelings existed at Rouen,\r\n where several members had to be excluded for heretical opinions.\r\n The introduction of the Spanish form of inquisition, under a bull\r\n of Paul IV, in 1557, still further exasperated the profession. The\r\n Inquisitors were directed to appoint diocesan tribunals, which\r\n should decide without appeal. The Parlement of Paris flatly refused\r\n to register the royal edict, and continued to receive appeals.\r\n The finale was the celebrated Wednesday meeting of the assembled\r\n chambers, the Mercuriale, where the King in person interfered with the\r\n constitutional freedom of speech, and ordered the arrest of the five\r\n members, thus giving his verdict for the ultra-Catholic minority of\r\n Parlement against the moderate majority. Marshal Vieilleville, himself\r\n a sound Catholic, strongly dissuaded this course of action. Its\r\n result was that one of the most influential elements of the State was\r\n not indeed brought into connection with Reform, but as placed in an\r\n attitude of hostility to the Government, and as the grievance was the\r\n consequence of the religious policy of the Crown, it had at all events\r\n a tendency to bring about a _rapprochement_ between the Reformers and\r\n the judicial classes.[48]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXECUTION OF DU BOURG\r\n\r\n(Tortorel and Perissin)]\r\n\r\nFive of the advocates of the Parlement of Paris, of whom Du Bourg\r\nand Du Four were the most prominent, protested against this action,\r\nboth because of its intolerance and because they believed it to be a\r\npolitical measure, at least in part, and were put under arrest for\r\nthis manifestation of courage. Men reasoned very differently regarding\r\nthis edict. The politicians and intense Catholics regarded it as\r\nnecessary, both to preserve the church and in order to suppress those\r\nseditious spirits, who, under color of religion, aimed to alter or\r\nsubvert the government. Others, who had no regard either for policy\r\nor religion, likewise approved of it, not as tending to extirpate the\r\nProtestants, for they believed it would rather increase their numbers,\r\nbut because they hoped to be enriched by confiscations and that the\r\nKing might thereby be enabled to pay his debts, amounting to forty-two\r\nmillions, according to Castelnau, and thus restore his finances.[49]\r\nThe trial of the parliamentary councilors was postponed for some time\r\non account of Henry II’s death, but soon afterward they were brought\r\nbefore “the bishops and Sorbonnists.”[50] Du Four, upon retraction, was\r\nsuspended from office for five years;[51] three others were fined and\r\nignominiously punished; but Du Bourg[52] was condemned and executed on\r\nDecember 23, 1559, in spite of the solicitations of Marguerite, wife\r\nof the duke of Savoy, and the count palatine who wrote to the King for\r\nhis life.[53]\r\n\r\nAt the same time the measures of the government were redoubled. In\r\nNovember, 1559, a new edict ordained that all who went to conventicles,\r\nor assisted at any private assemblies, should be put to death, and\r\ntheir houses be pulled down and never rebuilt. By special decree the\r\nprovost of the city was authorized, because Huguenot sessions were\r\nmore frequent in Paris and its suburbs than elsewhere, to proclaim\r\nwith the trumpet that all people who had information of Protestant\r\nassemblies should notify the magistrates, on pain of incurring the same\r\npunishment; and promise of pardon and a reward of five hundred livres\r\nwas to be given to every informer. The _commissaires des quartiers_\r\nof Paris were enjoined to be diligent in seeking out offenders and to\r\nsearch the houses of those under suspicion from time to time using\r\nthe _archers de la ville_ for that purpose. Letters-patent were also\r\ngiven to the lieutenant-criminal of the Châtelet and certain other\r\njudges chosen by the cardinal of Lorraine to judge without appeal.\r\nThe curés and vicars in the parishes were to excommunicate all those\r\nwho had knowledge of Protestant doings and failed to report them.[54]\r\nIn order to discover those who were Calvinists, priests bore the host\r\n(_corpus Domini_) through the streets and images of the Virgin were\r\nset up at the street corners, and all who refused to bow the head and\r\nbend the knee in adoration were arrested.[55] Similar measures were\r\nadopted in Poitou, at Toulouse, and at Aix in Provence where the double\r\nenginery of state and church was brought to bear in the suppression of\r\nheresy.[56] So great was the volume of judicial business as a result\r\nof these new measures that four criminal chambers were established at\r\nthe end of the year, one to try offenses carrying the death penalty,\r\nthe second for trial of those who might be condemned to make _amende\r\nhonorable_, the third to judge those who might be publicly burned,\r\nthe last to punish various other offenses.[57] The saner Catholic\r\nopinion, as, for example, that of Tavannes, the brilliant cavalry\r\nleader, reprobated this recourse to extraordinary tribunals on the\r\nground that the judging of criminals by special commissioners, who were\r\npersons chosen according to the passion of the ruler, was bound to be\r\nunjust or tyrannical, and that those counselors who were drawn from the\r\ncourts of the parlements to be so employed offended their consciences\r\nand mingled in that which did not pertain to them. Tavannes justified\r\nhis contention, legally as well as morally, on the ground that the\r\nKing, being a party in the cause could not justly change the ordinary\r\njudges.[58]\r\n\r\nThe assassination of Minard, vice-president of the Grand Chamber of\r\nthe Parlement of Paris, and one of the judges, who was shot in his\r\ncoach[59] on the night of December 18, the same day that Du Bourg\r\nwas degraded, was the protest against this order of things.[60] The\r\nmurder was committed in such a way that the author of it could never be\r\ndiscovered.[61] This was followed by that of Julien Frène, a messenger\r\nof the Parlement, while bearing some papers and instructions relating\r\nto the prosecution of certain Protestants. These two crimes undoubtedly\r\nhardened the government[62] and hastened the prosecution of Du Bourg,\r\nwho was put to death just a week later, on December 23, and led to some\r\nnew regulations. In order to protect the Parlement, it was commanded to\r\nadjourn before four o’clock, from St. Martin’s Eve (November 10) until\r\nEaster; a general police order forbade the carrying of any firearms\r\nwhatsoever[63] and in order to prevent their concealment, the wearing\r\nof long mantles or large hunting-capes was forbidden.[64]\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that the Huguenots were concerted not only for\r\nreligious, but for political interests. The distinction was fully\r\nappreciated at the time, the former being called “Huguenots of\r\nreligion” and the latter “Huguenots of state.”[65] The former were\r\nCalvinists who were resolved no longer to endure the cruelties of\r\nreligious oppression; the latter—mostly nobles—those opposed to the\r\nmonopoly of power enjoyed by the Guises.[66] The weight of evidence\r\nis increasingly in favor of the view that the causes of the Huguenot\r\nmovement were as much if not more political and economic than religious.\r\n\r\n It was only in the general dislocation and _désœuvrement_ of society\r\n that followed the cessation of the foreign wars that the French began\r\n to realize the weight of the burdens which their governmental system\r\n laid upon them. Until the religious sense gave a voice to the dumb\r\n discontent, social or political, first in the Huguenot rising and\r\n afterward in the outbreak of the League, there was little to show the\r\n real force of the opposition to the established order.[67]\r\n\r\nAbstractly considered, the religious Huguenots were not very dangerous\r\nto the state so long as they confined their activity to the discussion\r\nof doctrine. This could not easily be done, however, nor did the\r\nopponents of the church so desire; for the church was a social and\r\npolitical fabric, as well as a spiritual institution, and to challenge\r\nor deny its spiritual sovereignty meant also to invalidate its social\r\nand political claims, so that the whole structure was compromised. Thus\r\nthe issue of religion raised by the Huguenots merged imperceptibly\r\ninto that of the political Huguenots, who not only wanted to alter\r\nthe foundations of belief, but to change the institutional order of\r\nthings, and who used the religious opposition as a means to attack the\r\nauthority of the crown. The most active of this class were the nobles,\r\npossessed of lands or bred to the profession of arms, whom a species\r\nof political atavism actuated to endeavor to recover that feudal power\r\nwhich the noblesse had enjoyed before the powerful kings like Louis\r\nIX and Philip IV coerced the baronage; before the Hundred-Years’ War\r\nruined them; before Louis XI throttled the League of the Public Weal\r\nin 1465. The weakness of Francis II, the minority of the crown under\r\nCharles IX, and, above all, the dissatisfaction of the princes of the\r\nblood and the old aristocracy, like the Montmorencys, with the upstart\r\npretensions and power of the Guises—these causes united to make the\r\nHuguenots of state a formidable political party. Religion and politics\r\ntogether provoked the long series of civil wars whose termination was\r\nnot until Henry IV brought peace and prosperity to France again in\r\n1598.[68]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to picture the state of France at this time. The\r\nFrench were not essentially an industrial or commercial nation in the\r\nsixteenth century. France had almost no maritime power and its external\r\ncommerce was not great. The great majority of the French people was\r\ncomposed of peasants, small proprietors, artisans, and officials.\r\nIf we analyze city society, we find first some artisans and small\r\nmerchants—the bourgeois and the _gens-de-robe_ forming the upper\r\nclass. The towns had long since ceased to govern themselves. Society\r\nwas aristocratic and controlled by the clergy and nobility. The upper\r\nclergy was very rich. High prelates were all grand seigneurs, while the\r\nlower clergy was very dependent. Monks abounded in the towns, and the\r\ncurates possessed a certain influence. The most powerful class was the\r\nnobles, seigneurs, and gentlemen, who possessed a great portion of the\r\nrural properties, and still had fortified castles. They were wholly\r\nemployed either at court or in war, or held appointments as governors\r\nof provinces and captains of strongholds. The nobles alone constituted\r\nthe regular companies of cavalry, that is to say, the dominant element\r\nof the army. This class was therefore of influence in the state and\r\nthe most material force in society. The government was an absolute\r\nmonarchy. The king was theoretically uncontested master and obeyed\r\nby all; he exercised an arbitrary and uncontrolled power, and could\r\ndecide according to his pleasure, with reference to taxes, laws, and\r\naffairs both of the state and of the church, save in matters of faith.\r\nHe named and revoked the commissions of all the governors and acted\r\nunder the advice of a council composed of the princes of the blood and\r\nfavorites. But this absolute authority was still personal. The king\r\nwas only obeyed upon condition of giving the orders himself. There was\r\nno conception of an abstract kingship. If the king abandoned the power\r\nto a favorite, the other great personages of the court would refuse\r\nto obey, and declare that the sovereign was a prisoner. Everything\r\ndepended upon a single person. No one thought of resisting Francis I\r\nor Henry II because they were men grown at their accession. But after\r\n1559 we find a series of royal infants or an indolent monarch like\r\nHenry III. Then began the famous rivalries between the great nobles,\r\nrivalries out of which were born the political parties of the times, in\r\nwhich the Guises, the Montmorencys, and the famous Châtillon brothers\r\nfigure so prominently.\r\n\r\nFundamentally speaking, the aims of both classes of Huguenots were\r\nrevolutionary, and were directed, the one against the authority\r\nof the mediaeval church, the other against the authority of the\r\nFrench monarchy. The latter was a feudal manifestation, not yet\r\nrepublican. The republican nature of early political Huguenotism\r\nhas been exaggerated. There was no such feeling at all as nearly as\r\n1560,[69] and even at the height of Huguenot activity and power in\r\n1570-72, most men still felt that the state of France was _vrayement\r\nmonarchique_,[70] and that the structure of society and the genius\r\nof the people was strongly inclined to the form of government which\r\neight centuries of development had evolved; that it was searching for\r\nfalse liberty by perilous methods to seek fundamentally to alter the\r\nstate.[71] In a word, most political Huguenots in 1560 were reformers,\r\nnot revolutionists; the extremists were Calvinist zealots and those\r\nof selfish purposes who were working for their own ends. For in every\r\ngreat movement there are always those who seek to exploit the cause.\r\nMixed with both classes of Huguenots were those who sought to fish in\r\ntroubled waters, who, under the guise of religion or the public good,\r\ntook occasion to pillage and rob all persons, of whatever degree\r\nor quality; who plundered cities, pulled down churches, carried off\r\nrelics, burnt towns, destroyed castles, seized the revenues of the\r\nchurch and the king, informed for the sake of reward, and enriched\r\nthemselves by the confiscated property of others. Similar things are\r\nnot less true of the Catholics. For there were zealots and fanatics\r\namong them also, who under pretext of religion and patriotism were\r\nguilty of great iniquity and heaped up much ill-gotten wealth.[72]\r\n\r\nThe ascendency of the Guises quite as much as the suppressive measures\r\nof the government against Calvinism served to bring this disaffection\r\nto a head. The issues, either way, cannot be separated. The practical\r\naims of the Guises were large enough to create dismay without it being\r\nnecessary to believe that as early as 1560 they aimed to secure the\r\ncrown by deposing the house of Valois. It was unreasonable to suppose,\r\nthough it proved to be so in the end, that the four sons of Henry II\r\nwould all die heirless, and even in the event of that possibility,\r\nthe house of Bourbon still remained to sustain the principle of\r\nprimogeniture.\r\n\r\nThe Guises came from Lorraine, their father having been brother of\r\nthe old duke of Lorraine; and through their mother they were related\r\nto the house of Bourbon. They were thus cousins-german of the king of\r\nNavarre and the prince of Condé and related to the King and the princes\r\nof the blood. Their income, counting their patrimony, church property,\r\npensions and benefits received from the king, amounted to 600,000\r\nfrancs (nearly $500,000 today), the cardinal of Lorraine alone having\r\nthe disposal of half that sum. This wealth, united with the splendor of\r\ntheir house, their religious zeal, the popularity of the duke of Guise,\r\nand the concord which prevailed among them, put them ahead of all the\r\nnobles of the realm. The provincial governments and the principal\r\noffices were in their hands or those of their partisans.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal, who was the head of the house, was in the early prime\r\nof life. He was gifted with great insight which enabled him to see in\r\na flash the intention of those who came in contact with him; he had\r\nan astonishing memory; a striking figure; an eloquence which he was\r\nnot loath to display, especially in politics; he knew Greek, Latin,\r\nand Italian, speaking the last with a facility that astonished even\r\nItalians themselves; he was trained in theology; outwardly his life\r\nwas very dignified and correct, but, like many churchmen of the time\r\nhe was licentious. His chief fault was avarice, and for this he was\r\nexecrated. His cupidity went to criminal limits, and coupled with it\r\nwas a duplicity so great that he seemed almost never to tell the truth.\r\nHe was quick to take offense, vindictive, envious. His death would have\r\nbeen as popular as that of Henry II.[73]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the duke of Guise was a man of war, famed as the\r\nrecoverer of Calais and the captor of Metz. He was as popular as his\r\nbrother was otherwise. But, like him, he was avaricious stealing even\r\nfrom his own soldiers.[74] According to their opponents the ambition\r\nof the Guises was not to be content with the throne of France merely.\r\nThe throne of St. Peter and the crown of Naples were also believed to\r\nbe goals of their ambition, the cardinal of Lorraine aspiring to the\r\nfirst and his brother, the duke, aspiring to the other in virtue of the\r\nrelationship of the Guises to the house of Anjou, one-time occupants\r\nof the Neapolitan throne.[75] Even this programme was to be excelled.\r\nTheir enterprises in Scotland in favor of Mary Stuart[76] are known to\r\nevery student of English history; and after having vanquished Scotland\r\nmany of the German princes feared that they might move their forces\r\ninto Denmark in order to put the duke of Lorraine, their relative and\r\nthe brother-in-law of the king of Denmark, into possession of the\r\nkingdom.[77]\r\n\r\n“La tyrannie guisienne”[78] was a practical ascendency, not a mere\r\nfiction of their opponents. As uncles of Francis II, destined morally\r\nto be a minor always, owing to his weakness of will and mediocre\r\nability, having in their hands the chief offices of state, the Guises\r\nproceeded to build up a system of government wholly their own, not only\r\nin central but in provincial affairs, to compass which the removal of\r\nthe constable and the princes of the blood from the vicinity of the\r\nKing was the first step. Then followed an attempt to acquire control\r\nof the provincial governments. Montmorency, the late constable, was\r\ndeprived of the government of Languedoc;[79] the governments of\r\nTouraine and Orleans, in the very heart of France, were given to\r\nthe duke of Montpensier and the prince de la Roche-sur-Yon. Trouble\r\narose, though, in January, 1560, when the Guises excluded the prince\r\nof Condé from the government of Picardy and gave it to the marshal\r\nBrissac, although “the office had been faithfully administered by his\r\npredecessors.”[80]\r\n\r\nThe cardinal of Lorraine’s position with reference to the finances\r\nenabled him to provide the Guise faction with the resources necessary\r\nto back up its political intentions.[81] The onerous taxation of\r\nFrancis I had been increased by Henry II, both the taille and the\r\ngabelle, the collection of which had caused a fierce outbreak at\r\nBordeaux in the middle of the last reign; loans were resorted to, “not\r\nwithout great suspicion of their being applied to the King’s finances;”\r\nand the wages of the soldiers in garrisons and officers withheld.[82]\r\nThis condition of things naturally drew the constable[83] and his\r\npartisans toward the prince of Condé, who vainly endeavored to persuade\r\nthe king of Navarre, as first prince of the blood, and therefore the\r\nnatural supporter of the crown instead of the Guises, to take a firm\r\nstand, Condé especially representing to him how great a humiliation it\r\nwas to the crown that the administration of the kingdom should fall\r\nso completely into the hands of the “foreigners” of Lorraine; that,\r\nconsidering the weakness of the King, the fact that the provincial\r\ngovernorships and those of the frontier fortresses and the control of\r\nfinances (which enabled the Guises to subject the judiciary to their\r\ndevotion) were in their hands, foreboded ill to France.\r\n\r\nAntoine of Bourbon listened to the complaints against the the Guises,\r\nbut did little. At this time he was forty-two years of age. He was tall\r\nof stature, well-knit, robust; affable to everybody without affectation\r\nor display. His manners were open and frank, and his generosity was\r\nso great that he was always in debt. By the two merits of urbanity\r\nand generosity he made a superficial impression that did not last. In\r\nspeech he was vain, and imprudent and inconstant in word and deed,\r\nnot having the strength of will to adhere to a fixed purpose. He was\r\nsuspected of indifference to religion and even of impiety at this time\r\nbecause he renounced the mass, though it was generally thought that\r\nthis was with the purpose of making himself chief of the Huguenot party\r\nand not for religious zeal. The Protestants themselves called him a\r\nhypocrite.[84] Antoine would not make common cause with the constable\r\npartly from natural vacillation of character, partly because he\r\nbelieved that the constable had not supported his claims to the kingdom\r\nof Navarre, which he had been in hopes of recovering during the late\r\nnegotiations at Cateau-Cambrésis.[85] With the conceit of a weak man\r\nin a prominent position, the king of Navarre entertained schemes of\r\nhis own, which he proceeded to develop. His purpose was to play Spain\r\nand England against one another, in the hope that he either might\r\npersuade Philip II to restore the kingdom of Navarre to him by a firm\r\nadvocacy of Catholicism in France, which, of course, prevented him from\r\naffiliating with the Huguenot party to which Condé and the Châtillons\r\nwere attached; or, in the event of failure in this, to side with the\r\nHuguenots and enlist English support. Accordingly, shortly after his\r\narrival at the court from Béarn, on August 23, 1559, Antoine sent a\r\ngentleman to Throckmorton, the English ambassador in France, desiring\r\nhim to meet him “in cape” in the cloister of the Augustine Friars on\r\nthat night. When they met, after a long declaration of his affection\r\nfor Elizabeth, he said that he would write to her with his own hand,\r\nsince he would trust no one except himself, for if either the Guises or\r\nthe Spanish ambassador knew of it, “it would be dangerous to both and\r\nhinder their good enterprise.”[86]\r\n\r\nIn the interval, while waiting to hear from the English queen, Antoine\r\nof Bourbon, who had been coldly received at court, found that there\r\nwas no room for a third party between those of the constable and the\r\nGuises.[87] At the same time the latter were made fully aware of his\r\ndoings through the treachery of D’Escars, his chamberlain and special\r\nfavorite,[88] and shrewdly schemed to rid themselves of his presence\r\nby sending him to Spain as escort for Elizabeth, the celebration of\r\nwhose marriage (by proxy) to the King of Spain had come to such a\r\nfatal termination, and whose departure had been necessarily delayed\r\nby her father’s death.[89] In order to bait the hook the Guises\r\nrepresented to the beguiled king of Navarre that the opportunity was a\r\nmost excellent one to urge his claims to his lost kingdom, and called\r\nin Chantonnay, the Spanish ambassador in France, to enforce this\r\nargument.[90]\r\n\r\nThe spirit of unrest in France, both political and religious, was so\r\ngreat that only a head was wanting, not members, in order to bring\r\nthings to a focus. The whole of Aquitaine and Normandy was reported, in\r\nDecember, 1559, to be in such “good heart” as to be easily excited to\r\naction if they perceived any movement elsewhere;[91] in February, 1560,\r\nthe turbulence in Paris was so great that Coligny was appointed to go\r\nthither in advance of the King’s entrance “for the appeasing of the\r\ngarboil there.”[92] In order to repress this spirit of rebellion the\r\ngovernment diligently prosecuted the Huguenots.[93] The Guises hoped\r\nthat the severity exercised during the last few months in Paris and\r\nmany other cities against persons condemned for their religion, of whom\r\nvery great numbers were burnt alive,[94] would terrify the Calvinists\r\nand the political Huguenots into obedience. But on the contrary,\r\nlocal rebellion increased. At Rouen, at Bordeaux, and between Blois\r\nand Orleans, Huguenots arrested by the King’s officers were rescued by\r\narmed bands, in some cases the officers being killed. Indeed, so common\r\ndid these practices become that they were at last heard of without\r\nsurprise.[95]\r\n\r\n Imagine a young king [wrote the Venetian ambassador] without\r\n experience and without authority; a council rent by discord; the\r\n royal authority in the hands of a woman alternately wise, timid, and\r\n irresolute, and always a woman; the people divided into factions and\r\n the prey of insolent agitators who under pretense of religious zeal\r\n trouble the public repose, corrupt manners, disparage the law, check\r\n the administration of justice, and imperil the royal authority.[96]\r\n\r\nThe interests of the religious Huguenots and the political Huguenot’s\r\ncontinued to approach during the autumn and winter of 1559-60. In\r\norder to make head against the usurpation of the Guises,[97] which\r\nthey represented as a foreign domination, the latter contended that it\r\nwas necessary to call the estates of France in order to interpret the\r\nlaws, just as the Calvinists contended for an interpretation of the\r\nScriptures. The contentions of the Huguenots, the tyrannical conduct of\r\nthe Guises, the menaces which they did not hesitate to utter against\r\nthe high nobles of the realm, the retirement into which they had driven\r\nthe constable, the removal of the princes of the blood which they had\r\nbrought about upon one pretext or another, the contempt they expressed\r\nfor the States-General, the corruption of justice, their exorbitant\r\nfinancial policy, the disposal of offices and benefices which they\r\npracticed—all these causes, united with religious persecutions,\r\nconstituted a body of grievances for which redress inevitably would\r\nbe demanded. The question was, How? The leaders of the Huguenots—and\r\nthe term is used even more in a political sense than in a religious\r\none—were not ignorant of the history of the Reformation in Germany,\r\nnor unaware of the fact that politics had been commingled with religion\r\nthere.[98] The question of ways and means being laid before the legists\r\nof the Reformation and other men of renown in both France and Germany,\r\nit was answered that the government of the Guises could be _legally_\r\nopposed and recourse made to force of arms, provided that the princes\r\nof the blood, who, in such case had legitimate right to bear rule in\r\nvirtue of their birth, or any one of their number, could be persuaded\r\nto endeavor to do so.[99] But the attempt necessarily would have to be\r\nof the nature of a _coup de main_, for the reason that the King was\r\nin the hands of the Guises and the council composed of them and their\r\npartisans. After long deliberation it was planned, under pretext of\r\npresenting a petition to the King, to seize the cardinal of Lorraine\r\nand the duke of Guise, then to assemble the States-General for the\r\npurpose of inquiring into their administration, and before them to\r\nprosecute the ministers for high treason.[100] Three classes of men\r\nfound themselves consorting together in this movement: those actuated\r\nby a sentiment of patriotism, conceiving this to be the right way to\r\nserve their prince and their country; second, those moved by ambition\r\nand fond of change; finally, zealots who were filled with religious\r\nenthusiasm and a wish to avenge the intolerance and persecution which\r\nthey and theirs had suffered.[101] For such an enterprise Louis of\r\nBourbon, the prince of Condé, was the logical leader, both because of\r\nhis position as a prince of the blood and on account of his resentment\r\ntoward the Guises for having been excluded from the government of\r\nPicardy. But the prince, when besought to attempt the overthrow of\r\nthe Guises for the deliverance of the King and the state, in view of\r\nthe dubious conduct of his brother, concluded that it would be too\r\nperilous to the cause for him to be overtly compromised, in event\r\nof failure.[102] Montmorency was not possible as a leader, for his\r\nreligious leanings were in no sense Calvinistic; he was not a prince of\r\nthe blood, and therefore his contentions could not politically have the\r\nweight of Condé’s; and finally, his grievance was more a personal than\r\na party one.[103]\r\n\r\nThe conspirators found a leader in the person of a gentleman of\r\nLimousin or Périgord, one Godfrey de Barry, sieur de la Renaudie,[104]\r\nwho had been imprisoned at Dijon, escaped and found refuge in\r\nSwitzerland;[105] he had a special grievance against the Guises, who\r\nhad lately (September 4, 1558) put his brother-in-law, Gaspard de Heu,\r\nsieur de Buy, to death.[106]\r\n\r\nThe active participants were, in the main, recruited from the Breton\r\nborder, Anjou, Saintonge, and Poitou, with individual captains\r\nfrom Picardy, Normandy, Guyenne, Provence, and Languedoc.[107]\r\nTheir rendezvous was at Nantes, in a house owned, it is said, by\r\nD’Andelot.[108] But the author of the whole daring project was the\r\nfamous François Hotman, a French refugee at Geneva, and the real\r\ninspiration of the movement came from Switzerland, for the unexpected\r\ndeath of Henry II seemed to the French exiles in Switzerland to open\r\nthe door of the mother country again to them.[109]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONSPIRACY OF AMBOISE\r\n\r\nSURRENDER OF THE CHÂTEAU DE NOIZAY\r\n\r\n(Tortorel and Perissin)]\r\n\r\nThe whole plot was concerted in a meeting held at Nantes on February\r\n1, 1560,[110] which was chosen partly because of its remoteness,\r\npartly because the Parlement of Brittany being in session, the\r\nconspirators could conceal their purpose by pretending to be there\r\non legal business. A marriage festival also helped to disguise their\r\ntrue purpose; and for the sake of greater caution, the principals were\r\ncareful not to recognize one another in public.[111] It was determined\r\nto muster two hundred cavalry from each town in the provinces of\r\nGuyenne, Gascony, Périgord, Limousin, and Agenois. For the maintenance\r\nof this force they intended to avail themselves of the revenues and\r\neffects of the abbeys and monasteries of each province, taxing them\r\narbitrarily and using force if unable to obtain payment in any other\r\nway.[112] The initiative was to have been taken on March 6,[113]\r\nunder the form of presenting a petition to the King against the\r\nusurpation of the Guises.[114] Unfortunately for the success of the\r\nenterprise, it was too long in preparation and too widely spread to\r\nkeep secret.[115] The magnitude of the plot alarmed the Guises, in\r\nspite of the full warning they had received.[116] Aside from outside\r\nsources of information, the conspiracy was revealed by one of those\r\nin it, an advocate of the Parlement named Avenelles, whose courage\r\nfailed him at the critical moment.[117] Thereupon, for precaution’s\r\nsake, the court moved from Blois to the castle of Amboise, which the\r\nduke, having the King’s authority to support him, immediately set about\r\nfortifying. He likewise secured the garrison and townspeople, and found\r\na plausible pretext to watch the prince of Condé, by giving him one\r\nof the gates to defend; but, at the same time, sent his brother, the\r\ngrand prior along with a company of men-at-arms of assured fidelity.\r\nIn view of alarming rumors a posse was sent on March 11 under command\r\nof the count of Sancerre to Tours, where some ten or twelve of those\r\nin the plot, notably the baron de Castelnau, the captain Mazères,\r\nand a gentleman named Renay were already awaiting the money which was\r\nto be distributed among companies of theirs secretly stationed in\r\nthe neighboring villages.[118] Twenty-five of the conspirators were\r\narrested without opposition, whilst incautiously walking outside the\r\nChâteau de Noizay, between three and four leagues from Amboise, which\r\nbelonged to the wife of Renay, and the whole number of them, with\r\nfive others arrested at Tours by the count de Sancerre, were taken to\r\nAmboise. Immediate examination, though, showed that some of them had\r\nrisen in arms, partly from friendship for certain captains under whom\r\nthey had served, while others had been tempted by a trifle of earnest\r\nmoney in lieu of pay, as usual when soldiers were raised for companies,\r\nwithout knowing the place of their service, or its purpose. They were\r\nall dismissed, with the exception of one or two who remained prisoners,\r\nthe chancellor Olivier having admonished them and told them that though\r\nthey deserved to die the king of his clemency, for this once granted\r\nthem their lives.[119] To enable them to return home, the King had a\r\ncrown (teston = 10 to 11 sous) given to each man. But the alarm was not\r\nyet ended. That night (March 14) several couriers arrived at the court\r\nbringing new advices. The next morning at daybreak there was greater\r\ncommotion than ever before the castle, for two hundred cavalry made\r\ntheir appearance in the town. They thought themselves almost sure of\r\nnot finding any sort of resistance and that they consequently would\r\nbe able to effect their purpose, as all the princes and lords, like\r\nall the rest of the court, had no sort of defensive armour except\r\nsome coats of mail, and very few even of those, while their offensive\r\nweapons were merely swords and daggers, with a few pistols, whereas,\r\non the contrary, the insurgents were well armed with both kinds of\r\nweapons and were for the most part well horsed. Some boatmen saw the\r\ninsurgents following the course of the Loire, and their shouts aroused\r\nthe castle. One or two were killed, whereupon the rest took to flight\r\ntoward the country. But several were captured and two of them having\r\nbeen recognized as among the company who had been pardoned on the\r\nevening before, they were instantly hanged, with two others taken on\r\nthe preceding day, on the battlements over the castle gate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EXECUTION OF AMBOISE, DEATH OF CASTELNAU\r\n\r\n(Tortorel and Perissin)]\r\n\r\nAs a result of the new alarm there was a general scattering of bands\r\nof arrest on the next day (March 15). The marshal St. André was\r\ndispatched to Tours with nearly two hundred horse, with orders to\r\ntake five companies of men-at-arms from the garrison in the immediate\r\nneighborhood. He was followed by Claude of Guise, the duke d’Aumale,\r\nthe duke de Nemours and the prince of Condé.[120] Marshal Termes\r\nwas sent to Blois; the marshal Vieilleville to Orleans; the duke\r\nof Montpensier to Angers; La Rochefoucault to Bourges; Burie to\r\nPoitiers.[121] During the day some forty others were taken. Fifteen\r\nof those pursued retreated into a house and defended themselves most\r\nobstinately, wounding many of their assailants who surrounded it, so\r\nthat the house was set on fire: one of them, rather than surrender,\r\nburned himself alive by throwing himself into the flames. Toward\r\nnightfall six or seven more of them were hanged. The duke of Guise,\r\nwhom the King in the exigency of the moment, made lieutenant-general\r\non March 17,[122] did not fail to take every precaution; he appointed\r\ntwo princes and two knights of St. Michael for each quarter of Amboise,\r\nkeeping sentries there and sending out scouts as if the town were\r\nbesieged. The most exposed parts of the castle were repaired and\r\nsupplied with food, and above all with money, weapons, and artillery.\r\nThe most useful remedy, however, was the publication and transmission\r\nfor publication to all the towns and places in France of a general\r\npardon for all the insurgents who within twenty-four hours after its\r\nnotification should return to their homes, or otherwise they would\r\nbe proclaimed rebels and traitors, and license would be given to all\r\npersons to slay them and inherit their property; but assuring the\r\ninsurgents, nevertheless, that if they wished to say anything, or to\r\npresent any request to the King they would be heard willingly, without\r\nhurt, provided they made their appearance as loyal subjects.[123]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEATH OF LA RENAUDIE\r\n\r\n(Tortorel and Perissin)]\r\n\r\nThe prisoners confessed that in all the neighboring towns, viz.,\r\nBlois, Orleans, Chartres, Chateaudun, and others, a great supply of\r\narms had been made in secret, most especially of arquebuses, one of\r\nthe men who were hanged having revealed that in one single house at\r\nBlois there were six large chests full of these. During the next three\r\ndays nothing was attended to but fortifying the castle, repairing the\r\nweakest places around it, and making a trench in front of the principal\r\ngate, which opened on the country, in which some arquebuses and three\r\nor four small pieces of artillery found accidentally and brought there\r\nfrom neighboring places, were fixed. Round the town, besides cutting\r\nthe bridges which were at its gates, except the principal bridge over\r\nthe Loire, the moats were cleansed and restored, leaving but one gate\r\nopen.[124] Scouting parties were daily sent out, and on March 19 a\r\ncompany of five fell in with an equal number of insurgents; after a\r\nlong and stout fight the posse at length killed their commander and\r\ntwo of his men and made the other two prisoners. One of those killed\r\nproved to be La Renaudie.[125]\r\n\r\nBut the Guises did not stop with these acts of punishment near by.\r\nBesides sending letters of authority to all bailiffs and seneschals\r\nordering the arrest of all men, whether on foot or on horseback, to\r\nbe found in the country surrounding Amboise,[126] Tavannes, on April\r\n12,1560, was ordered to do the like in Dauphiné, being actually armed\r\nwith _lettres de cachet_ issued in blank.[127]\r\n\r\nFew other disturbances developed except at Lyons, and in Provence and\r\nDauphiné[128] but the government was anxious with regard to Gascony and\r\nNormandy, “their populations being much more daring,”[129] “The whole\r\nof Normandy is filled with Huguenotism,” wrote the Venetian ambassador,\r\n“the people by thousands sing every night until ten o’clock the Psalms\r\nof David and the men-at-arms dare not touch them. The people of\r\nDieppe every night in the market-place sing psalms and some days have\r\nsermons preached to them in the fields; in most towns in Normandy\r\nand many other places they do the same thing.”[130] In consequence\r\nof this state of things, the marshal de Termes was appointed with\r\nroyal authority and full and absolute powers throughout the province\r\nsummarily to confiscate, imprison, condemn and put to death whomsoever\r\nhe pleased.[131]\r\n\r\n In the end the government sent 1,200 of those implicated in the\r\n conspiracy of Amboise or under suspicion to execution. A morbid desire\r\n to witness the shedding of blood seized upon society, and it became a\r\n customary thing for the ladies and gentlemen of the court to witness\r\n the torture of those condemned after the manner of the _auto da fé_\r\n in Spain.[132] D’Aubigné[133] the eminent historian of the French\r\n Reformation, was an eye-witness of such incidents, and though but ten\r\n years of age, swore like young Hannibal before his father, to devote\r\n his life to vengeance of such atrocities.[134]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCATHERINE DE MEDICI BETWEEN GUISE AND CONDÉ. PROJECT OF A NATIONAL\r\nCOUNCIL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe insurrection of Amboise was not wholly displeasing to many even in\r\nthe court. Huguenot dissidence and the discontent of many persons with\r\nthe government gave the cardinal and the duke of Guise many troubled\r\nthoughts even after every external sign of disquiet had ceased. Strong\r\nsuspicion rested upon the prince of Condé[135] who was forbidden to\r\nleave the court and so closely watched that he was afraid to speak\r\nto any of his friends. The Guises were in a dilemma, not having the\r\ncourage to shed the blood royal,[136] yet, on the other hand, they\r\nfeared lest, by letting their suspicion pass in silence, the prince\r\nmight be rendered more daring and confident for the future.\r\n\r\nSo pointed did the accusation become that Condé finally demanded a\r\nhearing before the Council, where he cast down the gauntlet to the\r\nGuises, declaring that “whoever should say that he had any hand in\r\nconspiring against the King’s person or government was a liar and would\r\nlie as often as he said so;” he then offered to waive his privilege\r\nas a prince of the blood in order to have personal satisfaction and\r\nwithdrew. But the cardinal of Lorraine, instead of accepting the\r\nchallenge, made a sign to the King to break up the session.[137]\r\n\r\nAntoine of Navarre had been in the south of France during these events\r\nbut, nevertheless, he also did not escape suspicion; a secretary of\r\nhis who was staying in Paris to look after his affairs was searched\r\nand all the furniture of his house ransacked to discover incriminating\r\npapers, if possible.[138] The Bourbon prince was doubly alarmed at\r\nthe suspicion of guilt because his name was associated with that of\r\nthe English queen.[139] The king of Navarre may have had imperfect\r\nknowledge that something was in the wind when he left the court\r\nto visit his dominions in the south, but he was no party to the\r\nconspiracy.[140] Of Queen Elizabeth’s indirect participation there\r\nis no doubt at all. The belief prevailed in Paris that great offers\r\nhad been made to the earl of Arran by Gascony, Poitou, Brittany, and\r\nNormandy, if he would lead an English descent into those parts,[141]\r\nand in the two last-named provinces English merchants and sailors\r\nanimated the people to rebellion against the house of Guise by means of\r\nproclamations in the French language _printed in England_.[142] But if\r\nthe Guises shrank from shedding the blood of the princes, they struck\r\nas near to them as they dared, by urging the pursuit of Visières, a\r\nformer lieutenant of Montgomery, for whose apprehension, dead or alive,\r\na reward of 2,000 crowns was offered,[143] and Maligny, a lieutenant of\r\nthe prince of Condé.\r\n\r\nAlthough the initial purpose of the conspiracy had failed, namely\r\nto take the King and drive out the Guises,[144] Condé and his\r\nfollowers did not fail to perceive that things were not entirely\r\nunfavorable.[145] Catherine de Medici, who while jealous of the\r\nposition of the Guises in a place which naturally, and by tradition,\r\nif the regencies of Blanche of Castille and Anne of Beaujeu counted as\r\nprecedents, belonged to her, had nevertheless sustained the drastic\r\npolicy followed out after the execution of Du Bourg, in spite of the\r\narguments of the admiral.[146] Now, however, she saw her opportunity\r\nto make head against the cardinal and his brother and played into the\r\nhands of Coligny and Condé.[147] She prevailed upon the King to send\r\nthe admiral upon a special mission to Normandy late in July, where\r\nhe was expected to take the edge off the Marshal Termes’ conduct, and\r\nsecretly abetted the faction of the constable.[148] The opportunity\r\nwas the better to do these things owing to the death of the chancellor\r\nOlivier on March 27,[149] who had been an instrument of the Guises,\r\nand the queen mother was quick to seize it. The famous Michel de\r\nl’Hôpital[150] was immediately appointed to the vacancy. He was a man\r\nof great knowledge in the law and of great culture; at the moment he\r\nwas president of the _chambre des comptes_ and had been chancellor to\r\nMadame Marguerite of France, the duchess of Savoy (who had Protestant\r\nleanings, and had interceded for Du Bourg), and was a member of the\r\n_conseil privé_ of the King. L’Hôpital’s accession was followed by the\r\nproclamation of letters of pardon to all recent offenders, provided\r\nthey lived as good Catholics, the King declaring that he was unwilling\r\nto have the first year of his reign made notorious to posterity for\r\nits bloody atrocities and the sufferings of his people.[151] This was\r\nfollowed in May, 1560, by the royal edict of Romorantin, whereby the\r\njurisdiction of legal processes relating to religion was completely\r\ntaken away from the courts of parlement and from lay judges who had\r\npower to pass summary judgments, and was remitted to the ecclesiastical\r\njudges; which was interpreted as an assurance to accused persons\r\nthat they needed no longer fear the penalty of death, owing to the\r\nopportunity of delaying sentences by means of appeals from the acts\r\nand sentences of bishops to archbishops and from thence to Rome.[152]\r\nIn August a supplementary decree ordered the bishops and all curates\r\nto reside at their churches, the bishops being prohibited in the\r\nfuture from proceeding against anyone in the matter of religion except\r\nthe Calvinist preachers or persons in whose houses Huguenot meetings\r\nwere held, the government thus tacitly permitting others to live in\r\ntheir own way, which was interpreted as a virtual “interim.”[153]\r\nThe spirit of this legislation, as well as the skilful use of the\r\nlaw made therein, is certainly due to the heart and brain of the\r\nchancellor L’Hôpital, although Coligny is not without credit for his\r\ninfluence.[154]\r\n\r\nThese changes had the double effect, first, of persuading the queen\r\nto take the management of affairs upon herself and endeavor to remove\r\nthe house of Guise from court; and second, in giving the Huguenots\r\nand their partisans the opportunity of strengthening themselves. The\r\nleniency of the government drew back into France numbers of those who\r\nhad withdrawn, among them preachers from Geneva and England who gave\r\nnew life to the party by exhorting them to continue their assemblies\r\nand the exercise of their religion.[155] There was fear that the\r\n“interim” would be used by the Huguenots like the edge of a wedge to\r\nopen the way to possess churches of their own, and such a demand was\r\nshortly to be made openly in the King’s council at Fontainebleau in\r\nAugust, 1560.\r\n\r\nIt was apparent that there was not a province which was not affected,\r\nand there were many in which the new religion was even spreading into\r\nthe country, as in Normandy, Brittany, almost all Touraine, Poitou,\r\nGuyenne, Gascony, the great part of Languedoc, Dauphiné, Provence, and\r\nChampagne.[156] The “religion of Geneva” extended to all classes, even\r\nto the clergy—priests, monks, nuns, whole convents almost, bishops,\r\nand many of the chief prelates. The movement seemed to be widest\r\namong the common people, who had little to lose, now that life seemed\r\nsafe. Those who feared to lose their property were less moved. But\r\nnevertheless all classes of society seemed deeply pervaded. While the\r\n“interim” lasted only those were punished who were actually preaching\r\nand holding public assemblies. The prisons of Paris and other towns\r\nwere emptied, and in consequence there was a great number of persons\r\nthroughout the kingdom who went around glorying in the victory over the\r\n“papists,” the name which they give their adversaries. To add to the\r\ndiscomfiture of the Guises, the breach between them and Montmorency was\r\nwidened.[157] The duke of Guise had purchased the right of the sieur de\r\nRambures to the county of Dammartin, not far from Paris, and adjacent\r\nto that of Nanteuil,[158] which the duke had shortly before acquired,\r\nthe lower court of which was held in relief of Dammartin. In order to\r\ndo so the duke of Guise had persuaded Philippe de Boulainvilliers,\r\nwho had lately sold the property to the constable, to rescind the\r\ncontract which had been made, and sell it to him.[159] But the duke met\r\nwith a straight rebuff, for when he sent word of the transaction, the\r\nconstable answered by Damville, his son, that “as he had bought it, so\r\nwould he keep it.”[160] The feud between the Guises and Montmorency\r\nnaturally threw the “connestablistes” more than ever to the side of\r\nCondé. Damville was sent to the King and the queen mother, who were\r\nstaying at Chateaudun, to inform them that the Guises were his declared\r\nadversaries, and then went to confer with the prince of Condé, whom he\r\nmet, “environ le jour appelé la feste de Dieu au mois de Mai,”[161]\r\nbetween Etampes and Chartres, near Montlhéry, when on his way to\r\nGuyenne, to see his brother of Navarre. The Guises, who had information\r\nof the interview, enlarged upon the dangerous conduct of Condé and\r\npushed the suit for the lands of Dammartin in the courts.[162]\r\n\r\nCatholic zealots made much of the events of Amboise to enlarge\r\nthe reputation of the Guises. “During the whole of this Passion\r\nweek,” wrote the Venetian ambassador, “nothing has been attended to\r\nbut the sermons of the cardinal of Lorraine, which gathered very\r\ngreat congregations, not only to his praise, but to the universal\r\nastonishment and admiration, both on account of his doctrines and by\r\nreason of his very fine gesticulation, and incomparable eloquence and\r\nmode of utterance.”[163]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, those who abhorred him on account of religion and\r\nfor other causes did not fail to defame him by libels and writings\r\nplacarded publicly in several places in Paris, where they were seen and\r\nread by everyone who wished.[164] Scarcely a day passed without finding\r\nin the chambers and halls of the King’s own palace notes and writings\r\nof a defamatory nature abusing the cardinal of Lorraine. In Paris\r\nthe Palais de Cluny, belonging to the Guise family, full of furniture\r\nof great value, was nearly burnt by a mob.[165] In several places the\r\ncardinal’s painted effigy, in his cardinal’s robes, was to be seen,\r\nat one time hanging by the feet, at another with the head severed and\r\nthe body divided into four quarters, as was done to those who were\r\ncondemned. In the Place Maubert he was hanged in effigy and burnt with\r\nsquibs.[166]\r\n\r\nBut worse disturbances than violent manifestoes disquieted the\r\ngovernment. On June 1, 1560, the day of the Corpus Domini at Rouen,\r\nwhen the procession passed through the city with the customary\r\nsolemnities, it was remarked that in front of a certain house before\r\nwhich the procession passed no tapestry or any other decoration had\r\nbeen placed. Villebonne, the King’s officer, “who on account of these\r\ndisturbances about religion remained there,” perceived the omission and\r\nbeing suspicious of some clandestine meeting of the Huguenots, chose to\r\nverify the fact instantly. He attempted to enter the house by force,\r\nbut met with such stout resistance on the part of its inmates that\r\nthe procession was interrupted, and a great tumult arose, both sides\r\nhaving recourse to arms. After much fighting, each party having several\r\nwounded, at length with the death of some defenders of the house and\r\nafter very great effort, the authorities quieted the uproar as well\r\nas they could. Next morning upward of 2,000 persons appeared before\r\nthe royal magistrates, not only very vehemently to demand justice and\r\nsatisfaction for the death of those persons who had been killed, but\r\nto present also the “Confession” of what they believed and the mode in\r\nwhich they intended it should be allowed them to live, demanding that\r\nthe “Confession” should be sent to the King that it might be granted,\r\nand protesting that if on that account his ministers proceeded\r\nagainst any of them by arrest or capital punishment or other penalty,\r\nthey would put to death an equal number of Catholic officials of the\r\ngovernment. The president and four councilors of the Parlement of\r\nRouen journeyed to Paris to present the “Confession.” They assured the\r\nKing that the whole of Normandy was of the same opinion as those who\r\ndeclared themselves. In its quandary the government blamed Villebonne,\r\naccusing him of too much zeal and inquisitiveness. Moreover, fresh\r\ncommotions were heard of daily, and the government plainly feared some\r\nsudden attack like that of Amboise.[167]\r\n\r\nThe Guises plucked courage, however, from the fact that under the\r\npretext of still preparing for the war in Scotland in support of Marv\r\nStuart,[168] they could fill France with soldiery.[169] Months before\r\nthe outbreak of the conspiracy of Amboise their agents had been at work\r\nin Germany, using French gold for the purchase of arms, ammunition,\r\nand above all, men, for Germany was filled with small nobles of broken\r\nfortune, vagabond soldiers,[170] and lansquenets ready to serve\r\nwherever the pay was sure and the chance for excitement and plunder\r\ngood.[171]\r\n\r\nOn March 30, 1560, Guido Giannetti, Elizabeth’s secret agent at Venice,\r\nwrote to Cecil, “France will have enough to do in her religious wars\r\nthat have just sprung up, which will be worse than the civil war of\r\nthe League of the Public Weal, in 1465 under Louis XI.”[172] The\r\nprophecy soon became true. In spite of the formidable preparations made\r\nto continue the war in Scotland,[173] the more necessary since the\r\ndeath of the queen dowager of Scotland, news of which reached France\r\non June 18,[174] France—or rather the French party in Scotland—on\r\nJuly 6, 1560, signed the treaty of Edinburgh, which, so far as\r\nthe Guises were concerned, was the renunciation on their part of\r\naggression abroad.[175] Nothing but the grave state of home politics\r\ncould have induced the Guises so to yield the cause of their niece in\r\nScotland.[176]\r\n\r\nThe Huguenot issue promised to come to a climax during the summer\r\nof 1560.[177] From all over France came reports of sedition and\r\ninsurrection. The Protestants were masters of Provence.[178] The\r\ncardinal Tournon, returning from Rome, dared not bring with him the\r\ncross of the legation, for fear of its meeting with disrespect by\r\nthe people of the places through which he would have to pass.[179]\r\nFrom another source came the report that “very free sermons have been\r\ndelivered in the churches of Bayonne.”[180] The bishop of Agen wrote\r\nthe council that all the inhabitants of that city were in a state\r\nof furious insurrection; that they went to the churches, destroyed\r\nall the images, and maltreated certain priests. The queen mother\r\nwas mysteriously warned that unless she released certain preachers\r\nimprisoned at Troyes she would become the most unhappy princess\r\nliving.[181] The Pope’s legate left Avignon in disgust at the license\r\nof the “Lutherans,”[182] and when the pontiff proposed to send thither\r\nthe cardinal Farnese, who was willing to go provided a suitable escort\r\nof Italian and Swiss infantry was furnished, France refused to consent,\r\nbeing unwilling to allow a foreign prince to enter the kingdom on such\r\na warlike footing.[183]\r\n\r\nAt the same time the personal attack upon the Guises became more\r\nvenomous.[184] The enmity between the Guises and the house of\r\nMontmorency had become so open and proceeded so far, owing to the\r\ndispute about Dammartin, that it was expected they would take up arms.\r\nTo crown all, the government received information through several\r\nchannels of a design against the King and his ministers of worse\r\nquality than the recent Amboise conspiracy.[185] The information\r\nthat came to light caused the greatest anxiety because this time the\r\nevidence seemed strongly to compromise the vidame de Chartres,[186]\r\nand the prince of Condé.[187]\r\n\r\nAlthough the war in Scotland was practically at an end, the Guises\r\nhad not relaxed their efforts to raise men and money.[188] Philip II,\r\nknowing what was in progress, seems to have made a partial offer of\r\nassistance. In July fifteen German captains were dispatched beyond the\r\nRhine, each commissioned to bring back three hundred pistoleers for the\r\nKing’s service;[189] letters were sent to the Rhinegrave and Duke John\r\nWilliam of Saxony, urging them to form a league of the German princes\r\nand procure forces in case there should be need of them.[190] La Mothe\r\nGondrin was sent into Provence and Dauphiné, and another agent into\r\nChampagne, on similar errands.[191] Fifteen hundred men with armor\r\nand munitions were sent to the castle of Guise.[192] The Guises even\r\nendeavored to effect a reconciliation with the constable through the\r\nmediation of the marshal Brissac.[193]\r\n\r\nThe prevailing alarm was not allayed by the admiral, Gaspard de\r\nColigny, who at a full council meeting held at Fontainebleau, on\r\nAugust 20, 1560, presented two petitions,[194] one for the King, the\r\nother for his mother, asking the King, in the matter of religion, to\r\nconcede the petitioners two places of worship in two parts of the\r\nkingdom for greater convenience, that they might there exercise their\r\nrites and ceremonies as private congregations, without being molested\r\nby anyone, arguing that meetings in private residences would thus be\r\nobviated.[195] Coligny claimed to speak with authority, having been\r\nofficially sent into Normandy by the queen mother to inquire into the\r\ncause of the disturbances there. A hot altercation ensued between the\r\nadmiral and the cardinal of Lorraine. Coligny had prudently omitted\r\nsignatures to the petition, but declared that he “could get 50,000\r\npersons in Normandy to sign it,” to which the cardinal retorted\r\nthat “the King could get a million of his own religion to sign the\r\ncontrary.”[196] L’Hôpital, the chancellor, however, deftly diverted\r\nthe discussion into a political channel by a long discourse[197] upon\r\nthe condition of the realm, comparing it to a sick man, asserting\r\nthat the estates were troubled and corrupt, that religious dissidence\r\nexisted, that the nobility were dissatisfied, and concluded by saying\r\nthat if the source and root of all the calamities visiting France could\r\nbe discovered, the remedy would be easy.[198] In reply the cardinal\r\nof Lorraine offered to answer publicly for the administration of the\r\nfinances and showed by an abstract of the government accounts that\r\nthe ordinary expenses exceeded the revenue by 2,500,000 livres (over\r\nseven and one-half million dollars); his brother, the duke of Guise,\r\nas lieutenant-general, laid papers upon the table with reference to\r\nthe army and forces of the kingdom.[199] An adjournment was then taken\r\nuntil August 23, when, upon reassembling, each member of the Council\r\nwas provided with a memorandum containing a list of the topics which\r\nthe crown wished to have debated.[200]\r\n\r\nMontluc, the bishop of Valence,[201] as the youngest privy-councilor,\r\nbegan the discussion when the Council reconvened.[202] But the speech\r\nof the occasion was that of Marillac, the liberal archbishop of Vienne,\r\nwho, taking his cue from the chancellor, in a long discourse[203]\r\nenlarged upon the religious, political, and economic distress of\r\nFrance. His address is a complete statement of the Huguenot programme\r\nin church and state. He began by saying that the true “ancient and\r\ncustomary” remedy was a general council, but failing that, recourse\r\nmust be had to a national council, and then proceeded to enumerate\r\nthe things to be considered therein; first, the intrusion of foreign\r\nprelates—chiefly Italians—into French ecclesiastical offices,[204]\r\n“who fill a third portion of the benefices of the kingdom, who have an\r\ninfinite number of pensions, who suck our blood like leeches, and who\r\nin their hearts, laugh at us for being so stupid as not to see that\r\nwe are being abused;” secondly, he demanded that the clergy of France\r\nshow by some notable act that they were sincerely bent upon reform\r\nand not merely seeking to fortify their prerogatives and privileges\r\nunder the pretension of reform; and to this end the illicit use of\r\nmoney—“that great Babylonian beast, which is avarice, in whose path\r\nfollow so many superstitions and abominations”—must be guarded\r\nagainst; thirdly, the wicked must make sincere repentance; fourthly,\r\nfor the adjustment of the political and economic questions vexing the\r\npeople the States-General must be convened. Then followed a statement\r\nof conditions: that the king must live upon the income of the royal\r\ndomains, the spoliation of which should cease; that his wars be\r\nsupported by the old feudal aids and not by recourse to extraordinary\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\nThis speech highly pleased the admiral, who added three points,\r\nnamely, that, a religious “interim” be officially granted until the\r\nfindings of the Council of Trent, which the Pope was to be asked to\r\nreconvene; that in event of refusal to do so, a national council of\r\nthe clergy of France be called in which the Huguenots should have\r\na representation;[205] and that the number of guards around the\r\ncourt, “which were very expensive and only served to infuse fears and\r\njealousies into the people’s minds” be reduced.[206]\r\n\r\nThe upshot of the conference was the resolution to call a meeting of\r\nthe States-General for December 10 at Meaux (later changed to Orleans),\r\nand in default of the convening of a general church council, to convene\r\na national body of the clergy at Paris on January 10, 1561, the long\r\ninterval being allowed in order to permit the Pope to act.[207] In the\r\nmeantime the _status quo_ was maintained with reference to the worship\r\nof the Protestants, but for the sake of precaution, an edict was\r\nissued by which all subjects of the realm, whether princes or no, were\r\nprohibited from making any levy of men, arms, armor, horses, or moneys,\r\non pain of being declared rebels against his majesty.[208]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the resolution of the Council of Fontainebleau\r\nconformed to the conviction of a large element in France, the religious\r\ntroubles having stirred up a strong demand for another general council\r\nof the church (the second session of the Council of Trent having been\r\ninterrupted by the defeat of the emperor Charles V in the Smalkald\r\nwar), or a national council, if the convocation of the former proved\r\nimpossible.[209] Even the cardinal of Lorraine, desirous of acquiring\r\nfame by reforming the church of France, urged the course, though it\r\nwas hostile to the interest of the Holy See, until the development of\r\nevents at home persuaded him to change his tactics.[210]\r\n\r\nThe project of a national council was not pleasing to the Pope, who\r\ncherished the hope of reconvoking the Council of Trent,[211] either\r\nin France, Spain, or Germany.[212] When the cardinal of Lorraine\r\nurged it, the Pope’s rejoinder was that he would not divide Christ’s\r\ngarment.[213] The Holy Father was in a quandary, being unable with\r\nsafety to grant a free council, or to refuse the general one. He wanted\r\nto regard the prospective council as a _continuation_ of the Council\r\nof Trent, and not as a new council.[214] But there were political\r\ndifficulties in the way of so doing, for not all the German princes\r\nwere in favor of the decrees of Trent, and the Emperor was bound by\r\nhis oath not to attempt execution of the decrees lest the princes of\r\nthe Confession of Augsburg become alarmed for fear that the Emperor,\r\nHis Catholic Majesty and the Most Christian King had formed a Catholic\r\nconcert.[215] The Kings of Spain and France, moreover, although in\r\nfavor of the general council, had reservations of their own regarding\r\nthe application of the Tridentine decrees.[216]\r\n\r\nThe matter of the council was of much importance to every ruler in\r\nEurope. France, although resolved to convene the national clergy if\r\nthe Pope protracted things, nevertheless urged the latter to hasten to\r\ngrant a free and general council, not only by means of the bishop of\r\nAngoulême, the French ambassador in Rome, and the cardinals, but also\r\nthrough Bochetel, the bishop of Rennes, ambassador to the Emperor, and\r\nSebastian de l’Aubespine, the bishop of Limoges, ambassador to Philip\r\nII. The Venetian senate, too, was importuned to use its influence. But\r\nthe Pope hesitated for a long time, because the secular governments and\r\nhimself were divided upon the question as to whether such a council\r\nshould be regarded as a continuation of the Council of Trent (as the\r\nPope wished), or as a council _de novo_. The Pope was fearful of\r\ncompromising the papal authority by admitting the French contention\r\nof an authority superior to himself, for this he could never grant,\r\ntaking the ground that, whether present or absent, he was always the\r\nhead of and superior to all councils. Finally, Pius IV, alarmed by the\r\nresolution of the French government to assemble a national council if\r\nthe general council should not be held, both because it would diminish\r\nhis authority and because, even though nothing should be resolved on\r\nin opposition to the see of Rome, yet the assembling of a council by\r\nFrance without its consent would be prejudicial, and might be made a\r\nprecedent by other states, came to the conclusion that further delay\r\nwas dangerous, and convoked the general council for Easter, 1561, at\r\nTrent, “to extirpate heresy and schism and to correct manners,”[217]\r\ndeclaring that the canons of the church could permit of no other course.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of the French government had forced the hand of the\r\nPontiff, who, however, consoled himself by the thought that either the\r\nnational council would not now take place, or that the Guises would\r\nprevail in the States-General, so that the national council could\r\nbe silenced, if held.[218] The Pope figured that he would force the\r\nCatholic princes to side with him, lest by hazarding a change of\r\nreligion in a national council they would also endanger their kingdoms.\r\nPhilip II concurred in this belief. A king so orthodox as he had not\r\nfailed to watch the course of the movement in France upon the ground of\r\nreligious interests. But the Spanish King had also a political interest\r\nin France. His own Flemish and Dutch provinces were turbulent with\r\nrevolt, and Granvella wrote truly when he said that it was a miracle\r\nthat with the bad example of France, things were no worse in the Low\r\nCountries.[219] Accordingly, Philip II sent Don Antonio de Toledo\r\ninto France to divert the French King from the idea of a national\r\ncouncil.[220] The means of persuasion were readily at hand, for the\r\nFrench King was already far too compromised with Philip II to refuse\r\nhis request. After the arrest of the vidame of Chartres, Francis II, in\r\na long ciphered letter of August 31, 1560, to his ambassador in Spain,\r\nhad besought the Spanish king to be prepared to assist him, in case it\r\nshould be necessary.[221] To forefend the proposed national council,\r\nPhilip II now offered at his own expense to give the French aid in\r\nsuppressing all rebellion and schism.[222]\r\n\r\nWarlike preparations accordingly went forward under cover of a proposed\r\nintervention in Scotland,[223] which the uncertainty regarding Condé\r\nand Antoine of Bourbon facilitated, for it was currently believed\r\nthat both the king of Navarre and the prince absented themselves from\r\ncourt on purpose.[224] At the court the rumor prevailed that both\r\nwere plotting recourse to arms, so much so that on September 2 the\r\ncardinal Bourbon was sent to them, desiring them in the name of the\r\nKing to repair to the court, which, on the next day, was moved from\r\nFontainebleau to St. Germain.[225] The marshal Brissac was transferred\r\nfrom the government of Picardy to that of Normandy, and Du Bois, master\r\nof the footmen, was instructed to conduct all the footmen he could levy\r\nwith great secrecy into Normandy, while all the men in the ordinary\r\ngarrison of Picardy and other frontier points were drawn in toward\r\nOrleans.[226] At the same time the Rhinegrave was notified to come, but\r\nmet unexpected opposition.[227]\r\n\r\nParallel with these military preparations new financial measures\r\nwere taken. On October 11, 1560, the King demanded 100,000 crowns\r\n(testons—a silver coin valued at ten or eleven sous; the amount was\r\nbetween $750,000 and $775,000) from the members of the Parlement, the\r\nprovost, the chief merchants of Paris,[228] and “certain learned men\r\nof the Sorbonne.”[229] The Parisians murmured because they thought the\r\nmilitary display was meant to intimidate them. In November the crown\r\nimposed 10,000 francs (approximately $7,500) upon Orleans and demanded\r\n100,000 more to pay the troops.[230] Lyons furnished a loan[231] and\r\nmoney was also secured by confiscations from the Huguenots on the part\r\nof the local authorities in many places.[232]\r\n\r\nIn the provinces disturbances continued to take place.[233] In Amboise\r\nand Tours the people stormed the prisons and released all those who had\r\nbeen confined as agitators on account of religion.[234] The valley\r\nof the Loire seems to have been the storm center of these provincial\r\nuprisings, and in the middle of October[235] the king came hastily to\r\nOrleans with three companies of veteran infantry from the garrisons\r\nof Picardy.[236] It was now decided to convene the States-General at\r\nOrleans instead of Meaux.[237] On October 30 the prince of Condé,\r\nwho all along had borne himself as if innocent and who came with his\r\nbrother to Orleans, was arrested,[238] and the vidame of Chartres, who\r\nhad been incarcerated in the Bastille, was sent for from Paris that he\r\nmight be examined face to face with Condé.[239] Besides being accused\r\nof implication in the conspiracy of Amboise, he was accused of being\r\nthe author of the recent insurrection at Lyons.[240]\r\n\r\nA significant change was made in the provincial administration at\r\nthis time. The Guises, having observed the dissatisfaction that\r\nprevailed because so many offices, dignities, and commissions had\r\nbeen distributed among them, in order to fling a sop to the princes\r\nof the blood and their faction, advised the King to create two\r\nnew governments in the middle of the kingdom in favor of the duke\r\nof Montpensier and his brother, the prince de la Roche-sur-Yon. In\r\ncompliance with this suggestion the government of Touraine, to which\r\nprovince was added the duchies of Anjou and Vendôme and the counties\r\nof Maine, Blois, and Dunois, was created in favor of the former, and\r\nthe government of Orleans, to which was added the duchies of Berry,\r\nthe _pays_ Chartrain, the Beauce, Montargis, and adjacent places,\r\nin favor of the latter. But the new office was reduced to a shadowy\r\npower by the revolutionary step of appointing provincial lieutenants\r\nover the governors, who were responsible to the duke of Guise as\r\nlieutenant-general of the realm, in this case the sieur de Sipierre\r\nbeing lieutenant in the Orléannais and Savigny in Touraine, each of\r\nwhom was a servitor of the Guises.[241]\r\n\r\nThere is little reason to doubt that the Huguenots would have made\r\na formidable revolt at this early day if they had been certain of\r\neffective leadership. But the cowardice of Antoine of Navarre, the\r\nlogical leader of the party, prevented them from so doing. The great\r\ninfluence he might have exerted as first prince of the blood was in\r\nsingular contrast with his weak character.[242] His policy, which he\r\nflattered himself to be a skilful one of temporization, was looked upon\r\nwith contempt by the Huguenots, who despised him for weakly suffering\r\nhis brother to be so treated and then added to his pusillanimity\r\nby foregoing his governorship of Guyenne, which was given to the\r\nmarshal Termes.[243] In vain the Huguenot leaders urged upon him their\r\nsupplications and their remonstrances;[244] in vain they laid before\r\nhim the details of their organization; that six or seven thousand\r\nfootmen throughout Gascony and Poitou were already enrolled under\r\ncaptains; that between three and four thousand, both foot and horse,\r\nwould come from Provence and Languedoc; that from Normandy would come\r\nas many or even more, with a great number of cavalry; that with the aid\r\nof all these he would be able to seize Orleans (thus controlling the\r\nStates-General), and Bourges, with Orleans the two most important towns\r\nin central France. They assured him that thousands were merely waiting\r\nfor a successful stroke to declare themselves and that money was to be\r\nhad in plenty; for every cavalryman and every footman was supplied with\r\nenough money for two months and that much more would be forthcoming,\r\nprovided only the king of Navarre would declare himself the protector\r\nof the King and the realm and oppose the tyranny of the Guises.[245]\r\n\r\nThis was the moment chosen by Catherine de Medici to assert herself.\r\nHitherto, there had been no room for her between the two parties, each\r\nof which aspired to absolute control of the King. The queen mother had\r\nno mind to see herself reduced to a simple guardian of the persons\r\nof her children, utterly dependent upon the action of the council,\r\nwithout political authority nor “control of a single denier,”[246]\r\nand perceived that she might now fish to advantage in the troubled\r\nwaters; to change the figure, she determined to play each party against\r\nthe other[247] in the hope of herself being able to hold the balance\r\nof power between them. This explains her double-dealing after the\r\nconspiracy of Amboise, when she represented to Coligny that she wished\r\nto be instructed in the Huguenot teachings in order, if possible,\r\nthat she might be able to discover the “true source and origin of\r\nthe troubles,” and conferred with Chaudien, the Protestant pastor in\r\nParis, and Duplessis, the Huguenot minister at Tours, at the same time\r\nalso inquiring into the political claims of the Huguenots, having the\r\ncardinal of Lorraine concealed, like Polonius, behind the arras;[248]\r\nwhy, too, she used fair words at the conference at Fontainebleau and\r\nsimultaneously saw Francis II write to Philip II asking for Spanish aid\r\nin the event of civil war.\r\n\r\nThe Venetian ambassador said truly that the famous Roman temporizer,\r\nFabius Cunctator, would have recognized his daughter in this astute\r\nwoman of Etruria.[249] For fear of being sent back to Italy or of\r\nstaying in France without influence, she aimed to play the two parties\r\nagainst one another. She did not hesitate to hazard the crown in\r\norder to keep the government in her hands, although, as the Venetian\r\nambassador said, “to wish to maintain peace by division is to wish to\r\nmake white out of black.”[250]\r\n\r\nThe time was a peculiarly propitious one. With the prince of Condé\r\nout of the way[251] she counted upon the vacillation and hesitancy of\r\nthe king of Navarre to keep the Huguenots from overt action, while\r\nthe prospect of the coming States-General, which had grown out of the\r\nassembly at Fontainebleau, as the bishop of Valence had predicted,[252]\r\nfilled the Guises with dismay, so much so that when the demand for the\r\nsummons of that body began to grow, they had endeavored to persuade\r\nthe King to ordain that whoever spoke of their convocation should be\r\ndeclared guilty of _lèse-majesté_.[253] The reason of their alarm is\r\nnot far to seek. The demand for the States-General was the voice of\r\nFrance, speaking through the noblesse and the bourgeoisie. crying\r\nout for a thorough inquiry into the administration of the Guises and\r\nreformation of the governmental system of both state and church; as\r\nsuch it was a menace to the cardinal and his brother and in alignment\r\nwith the demands of the political Huguenots. The costly wars of\r\nHenry II, the extravagance of the court; the burdensome taxation;\r\nthe venality of justice; the lawlessness and disorder prevailing\r\neverywhere; the impoverishment of many noble families, and the rise\r\nof new nobles out of the violence of the wars in Picardy and Italy,\r\nmore prone to license and less softened by the social graces that\r\ncharacterized the old families;[254] the dilapidation of ancestral\r\nfortunes and the displacements of wealth; the religious unrest; the\r\ncorruption of the church—all these grievances, none of which was\r\nwholly new, were piling up with a cumulative force, whose impending\r\nattack the Guises regarded with great apprehension.[255]\r\n\r\nThe administration of the cardinal of Lorraine and his ducal brother\r\nhad not mended matters, but in justice to them it should be said\r\nthat their ministry was quite as much the _occasion_ as the _cause_\r\nof the popular outcry for reform. The evils of the former reign\r\nwere reaching a climax which their haughtiness and ambition served\r\nto accentuate.[256] Misappropriation of public moneys, exorbitant\r\ntaxation, denial of justice, spoliation of the crown lands, especially\r\nthe forests, the dilapidation of church property, and the corruption\r\nof manners, were undoubtedly the deepest popular grievances. In the\r\ndemand for redress of these grievances all honest men were united. In\r\n1560 the cry of the Huguenots for freedom of worship was the voice of\r\na minority of them only. Most Huguenots at this time were political\r\nand not religious Huguenots, who simply used the demand of the new\r\nreligionists as a vehicle of expression; this sentiment also for local\r\nrisings to rescue arrested Calvinists, the participants in many cases\r\nbeing actuated more by the desire to make a demonstration against the\r\ngovernment than by sympathy with the Calvinist doctrines.[257]\r\n\r\nThe debts of the crown at the accession of Francis II aggregated\r\nforty-three millions of livres,[258] upon which interest had to be\r\npaid, without including pensions and salaries due to officers and\r\nservants of the royal household, and the gendarmerie, which were from\r\ntwo to five years in arrears,[259] a sum so great that if the entire\r\nrevenue of the crown for a decade could have been devoted to its\r\ndischarge, it would not have been possible to liquidate it. The result\r\nwas the provinces abounded with poor men driven to live by violence and\r\ncrime, while even the nobility, because of their reduced incomes, and\r\nthe soldiery on account of arrears of wages, were driven to plunder the\r\npeople.[260] Even members of the judiciary and the clergy had recourse\r\nto illicit practices.[261] The regular provincial administration was\r\npowerless to suppress evils so prevalent, whose roots were found in\r\nthe condition of society. It was in vain that the crown announced that\r\nit was illegal to have recourse to arms for redress of injuries and\r\ncommanded the governors in the provinces, the bailiffs, seneschals,\r\nand other similar officers to stay within their jurisdictions and\r\nvigilantly to sustain the provost-marshals in suppressing sedition or\r\nillegal assemblies. Some men thought the remedy lay in more drastic\r\npenalties and advocated the abolishment of appeal in criminal causes,\r\nas in Italy and Flanders.[262] But history in many epochs shows that\r\nthe social maladies of a complex society cannot be so cured. Obviously\r\nthe true remedy lay in searching out the causes of the trouble and\r\ndestroying them, and this was the intent of the demand for the\r\nStates-General.\r\n\r\nThe summons of the States-General of Orleans and the further act of\r\nthe government in announcing that it would summon a national council\r\nof the French clergy to meet in Paris on January 10, 1561, unless\r\nthe Council General was called in the meantime, were equivalent to\r\npromises that reform would be undertaken in both state and church.\r\nThe double announcement was the simultaneous recognition of one\r\nnecessity—reformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE STATES-GENERAL OF ORLEANS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prosecution of the prince of Condé and the vidame of Chartres was\r\npushed during the month of November in order to overcome any Huguenot\r\nactivity in the coming States-General.[263] The Guises assured both the\r\nPope and Spain that their intention was, after the execution of the\r\nprince, to send soldiery into the provinces under the command of the\r\nmarshals St. André, Termes, Brissac, and Sipierre, whose Catholicism\r\nwas of a notoriously militant type, and thus either to crush the\r\nHuguenots, or drive them out of the country.[264] Condé claimed, upon\r\nthe advice of his counsel, the advocates Claudius Robert and Francis\r\nMarillac, that as a prince of the blood he had to give account to the\r\nKing alone and to judges suitable to his condition, as peers of France,\r\ndenying the jurisdiction of the ordinary judges.[265] This the latter\r\nrefused to allow, on the ground that there was no appeal from the King\r\nin council (which at least had been the practice of the crown since\r\nFrancis I) because the judgment so given was an absolute declaration of\r\nthe king’s pleasure; whereupon Condé, after the example of Marchetas,\r\nwhen condemned by Philip of Macedon, appealed from the King in bad\r\ncouncil to the King in good council. The prince, however, adhered to\r\nhis claim, until by a subterfuge he was made, in a way, to commit\r\nhimself; for at last he signed an answer _to his counsel_, Robert,\r\nwhereby the prosecution gained a point prejudicial to him, although\r\ngood lawyers affirmed that a defendant’s counsel could not be made his\r\njudge. Thereupon the government organized a court in which there was\r\na sprinkling of peers, in order to seem to comply with the law.[266]\r\nUnder such practices the judgment was a foregone conclusion, although\r\neven after being declared guilty, the general opinion was that the\r\nprince would not be put to death, but that the worst that could befall\r\nhim would be imprisonment in the dungeons of Loches, where Ludovic\r\nSforza died in the reign of Louis XII; or that he would be kept in\r\nconfinement elsewhere pending greater age on the part of the king and\r\nnew developments.[267]\r\n\r\nWhat Condé’s fate would have been still remains a problematical\r\nquestion, for Francis II died at Orleans on December 5, 1560, and his\r\ndeath put an end to all proceedings against the prince.[268] The prince\r\nof Condé was released on December 24, and immediately went to La\r\nFère in Picardy.[269] The crown descended to the dead king’s younger\r\nbrother, Charles IX, a boy ten years of age. His accession was not an\r\nauspicious one. Well might the Venetian ambassador exclaim: “Vae tibi\r\nterra cujus rex puer est.”[270] The execution of two Calvinists in\r\nRouen on December 3 occasioned a riot during which the gates of the\r\ncity were shut,[271] and at Bordeaux a serious insurrection of 1,200\r\npersons had taken place in consequence of the arrest of Condé, so that\r\nthe general pardon of religious offenders issued on January 3, 1561,\r\nwas a wise step.[272] All the plans designed and prepared for execution\r\nat Orleans were broken by the death of the King. The Guises were\r\nfurious.[273]\r\n\r\nIt was hoped that the new reign might be established tranquilly,\r\nwithout an appeal to arms, but there was much misgiving owing to “the\r\nbad spirit among the people on account of the religious question, and\r\nof their dislike of the existing government.”[274] Many had thought\r\nthat in the event of the death of the king a general uprising might\r\nresult throughout the realm, for religious and administrative reform,\r\nsince Charles IX, being a minor, would be placed under the guidance of\r\nthe king of Navarre, the oldest and nearest prince of the blood, who\r\nby consenting to the demands of the Huguenots, either from inclination\r\nor from inability to repress them, would open the door to such a\r\ncourse. Others believed that the Guises would not be put down, but\r\nthat with the military resources concentrated around Orleans, at their\r\ndisposal, they would seek to overawe the opposition and retain their\r\npower, finding means, through papal dispensation, to marry Mary Stuart\r\nto the new king.[275] There was a third class who rightly surmised\r\nthat the queen mother, if not able to establish the regency in her\r\nfavor, would play the parties against each other in such a way as to\r\nbe able to exercise large control herself. In pursuance of this double\r\ncourse, Catherine secretly incited the king of Navarre and the prince\r\nof Condé, giving out that the action lately taken against the latter\r\nhad been by the advice of the Guises. At the same time she gave the\r\nGuises to understand that the hard feeling which the Bourbon princes\r\nfelt for them was contrary to her wish and pleasure and that it was\r\nthey who had sought to compel the Guises to render account of their\r\nadministration.[276]. As the constable seemed to command the balance\r\nof power, both the queen mother and the Guises began to compete for\r\nhis favor,[277] Catherine overcoming her old enmity on account of her\r\nfear of the Guises.[278] Between the Guises and Montmorency the enmity\r\nwas too great for any _rapprochement_, so that the Guises endeavored\r\nto counter the coalition of Catherine de Medici and the constable\r\nby overtures to Antoine of Navarre, whose own pliant nature readily\r\nyielded to their blandishments, telling him that Philip II probably\r\nwould be inclined to restore his lost kingdom of Navarre or give him\r\nan equivalent in Sardinia, in the event of the adoption of a strong\r\nCatholic policy on his part.[279]\r\n\r\nCatherine de Medici, however, by the promptness of her action, and\r\nperhaps not a little owing to the unpopularity of the cardinal of\r\nLorraine,[280] got the better of the Guises, the government being\r\norganized around the queen mother and the three Bourbon princes, the\r\nking of Navarre, the cardinal of Bourbon, the prince of Condé the\r\nconstable, the three Châtillons—the admiral Coligny, the cardinal\r\nOdet, and D’Andelot—the duke de Montpensier and the prince de la\r\nRoche-sur-Yon.[281] The duke of Aumale, the marquis of Elbœuf, the\r\ngrand prior of France, and the cardinals of Lorraine and Guise, all\r\nbrothers of the duke of Guise and the cardinal of Lorraine left the\r\ncourt at the same time,[282] but if the pride of the Guises was\r\nwounded, they did not show it. They were followed by all the companies\r\nof ordinance, both cavalry and infantry, which had been sent to Orleans.\r\n\r\nBut Catherine de Medici looked farther than the present order of things\r\nand schemed to have the coronation effected as soon as possible,\r\nthinking that it would remove many difficulties alleged of the King’s\r\nminority[283] and make him of sufficient authority to appoint such\r\ngovernors as he pleased.[284] She found means to have it arranged in\r\nthe Privy Council (March 27, 1561) that she and the king of Navarre,\r\nin the capacity of lieutenant-general, should rule jointly, the King’s\r\nseal being in the custody of both and kept in a coffer to which each\r\nshould carry a different key. This astute move gave Catherine exclusive\r\nguardianship of the person of Charles IX, and assured her at least an\r\nequal power in the regency.[285] At the same time orders were given\r\nfor the ambassadors and others who wished for audience to ask it of\r\nthe queen mother through the secretaries.[286] By this new arrangement\r\nit became unnecessary to give account of one’s business first of all\r\neither to the cardinal of Lorraine or the constable, or to anyone else,\r\nas was usually done before; but at once to address the queen, who,\r\nshould the matter need to be referred to the council, could propose\r\nit and give reply according to their decision. As not one of these\r\ncouncilors was superior to another, the power was all in Catherine’s\r\nhands. She had played her cards well and had won. The duke of Guise\r\nceased to be of influence at court and the constable “was satisfied to\r\nlose his authority in order to damage his enemies.”[287] France began\r\nto awaken to the fact that the queen who had led a life of retirement\r\nduring her husband’s reign, in that of her son was evincing that\r\ncapacity for public affairs which was an hereditary possession in her\r\nfamily. In her quality as queen mother, she kept the King well in hand.\r\nShe would not permit anyone but herself to sleep in his bed-chamber;\r\nshe never left him alone. She governed as if she were king. She\r\nappointed to offices and to benefices; she granted pardon; she kept the\r\nseal; she had the last word to say in council; she opened the letters\r\nof the ambassadors and other ministers. Those who used to think she was\r\na timid woman discovered that her courage was great; and that, like Leo\r\nX and all his house, she possessed the art of dissimulation.[288]\r\n\r\nThe Huguenots had hoped for much politically from the sudden\r\nrevolution, and looked forward to organizing the States-General,\r\nwhile the Catholics hoped that the precautions taken during the\r\nelections had insured the election of men opposed to any novelty in\r\nthe matter of religion.[289] The first session took place on December\r\n13.[290] L’Hôpital, the chancellor, made an eloquent and earnest\r\nplea in favor of harmony among the members, endeavoring to draw them\r\naway from religious animosities by pointing out the great necessity\r\nof administrative and political reform, urging that the root of the\r\npresent evils was to be found in the miscarriage of justice, the\r\nburdensome taxes, the corruption of office, etc.[291]\r\n\r\nHe ascribed the religious inquietude to the degeneracy of the church\r\nand advocated thorough reform of it, saying that the clergy gave\r\noccasion for the introducing of a new religion, though he avoided\r\nentering into the matter of merit of its doctrines.[292] He pointed out\r\nthe needs of France and the necessity for civil and religious concord,\r\nand, in the peroration pleaded for earnest, patriotic support of the\r\nboy-King, “for there never was a father, no matter of what estate or\r\ncondition, who ever left a little orphan more involved, more in debt,\r\nmore hampered than our young prince is by the death of the kings, his\r\nfather and his brother. All the cost and expenses of twelve or thirteen\r\nyears of long and continuous war have fallen upon him; three grand\r\nmarriages are to be paid for, and other things too long to tell of now;\r\nthe domain, the aids, the salt storehouses, and part of the _taille_\r\nhave been alienated.”[293]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the efforts of the chancellor, however, to smooth the\r\nway, the ship of state encountered rough water at the very beginning.\r\nIt was doubtful whether anything would come of the session, as the\r\ndifficulties between the delegates were endless, partly from the\r\ndiversity of their commissions and of the requests they had to make,\r\npartly from individual caprice. The commons and the clergy readily\r\nagreed to meet together, but many of the nobility made difficulty.\r\nSome of those of Guyenne and of some parts of Brittany, Normandy, and\r\nChampagne would not consent to treat with the government without a\r\nfresh commission, saying that their commission was to the late king,\r\nFrancis II—an invention of those who were not satisfied with the\r\npresent government and disliked the queen’s supremacy.[294] Perceiving\r\nthis obstacle, the queen sent for the president of La Rochelle and told\r\nhim to have an autograph list made of all those who dissented and to\r\nbring it to her. But no one dared to be the first to sign this list.\r\nThis was admirable adroitness on Catherine’s part. She was playing for\r\na large stake, because if the estates treated with the new government,\r\nthey would in a certain way approve its legitimacy by general consent.\r\n\r\nFinally, after a week’s delay, during which the _cahiers_ of the\r\ndelegates were handed in and classified, deliberations were resumed.\r\nThe three chief questions before the estates of Orleans were religion,\r\nthe finances, and the regulation of the courts of judicature. The\r\nthree estates in order, beginning with the commons, presented each its\r\ncause. The orator of the third estate, an _avocat du roi_ at Bordeaux,\r\ndemanded a general council for the settlement of religious controversy;\r\nthe discipline of the clergy, whom he denounced in scathing terms;\r\ntheir reformation in manners and morals; revision of justice, and\r\nalleviation of taxes.[295] As a whole, the commons seemed to wish for\r\na general pardon for all the insurgents, and that everybody should be\r\nrestored to favor; that the election of prelates should be regulated,\r\nso as to insure the nomination of fitting persons to reform the life\r\nand customs of the clergy; and that the revenues of the churches should\r\nbe limited to persons appointed for that purpose.[296]\r\n\r\nThe spokesman of the noblesse, one Jacques de Silly, sieur de\r\nRochefort, invoked biblical authority, besides Assyrian and classical\r\nhistory, to prove that the nobility had been ordained of God and\r\nrecognized by men of all times as the pillar of the state. The harangue\r\nwas a carefully worded assertion of the political interests and claims\r\nof the nobility. Even religion was subordinated to their political\r\nends, a written memorial being presented by some of the nobles asking\r\nfor leave for each great feudal proprietor to ordain what worship he\r\nmight choose within his lands, after the manner of the settlement at\r\nAugsburg in 1555 (_cujus regio, ejus religio_).[297]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATES-GENERAL OF ORLEANS\r\n\r\n(Tortorel and Perissin)]\r\n\r\nThe clergy naturally were in conformity with the canons and the\r\nCatholic ritual. They were declared to be “the organ and mouth” of\r\nFrance, much history and doctrinal writing being cited to prove their\r\nsupremacy. Liberty of election in the matter of church offices,\r\nabolition of the abuse of the _dîme_, which, it was complained, had\r\nbeen extorted from the church, not once, but four, five, six, and even\r\nnine times in a year, and prelates put in prison for failure to pay, to\r\nthe destruction of worship in the churches; suppression of heresy (thus\r\nearly stigmatized as _la prétendue réformation_), and royal support\r\nof the authority of the priest-class, were the four demands of the\r\nclerical order.[298] The sittings were rendered less tedious by a bold\r\nattack made upon the persecution of religion by a deputy who demanded\r\nthat the Huguenots be permitted to have their own church edifices—a\r\nplea which was reinforced by a hot protest of the admiral Coligny\r\nagainst an utterance of Quintin, the clerical orator.[299]\r\n\r\nAs to religion, grave questions arose. Would the toleration of religion\r\noccasion civil war? Would it cause an ultimate alteration of the faith\r\nof France? Would it, finally, alter the state, too? The States-General\r\nrefused to enter deeply into these problems. The petition of the\r\nProtestants was not mentioned.[300] In the end it was determined to\r\ngrant a general pardon to all throughout the kingdom, without obliging\r\nanyone to retract, or to make any other canonical recantation—a\r\nproposal which was quite at variance with the constitution of the\r\nchurch and was regarded by Rome as exceeding the bounds of the\r\nauthority of the King and his Council, cognizance of matters of this\r\nnature appertaining to ecclesiastics and not to laymen.[301] The\r\npressure of the third estate as well as the influence of Coligny,\r\nL’Hôpital, and others, is discernible in this measure. For it had been\r\ndetermined in the Privy Council that should the Council-General not\r\nbe held before June, the National Council would assemble in France.\r\nThis could not be denied to the estates who demanded it; and this\r\nconcession apparently at first caused all the three estates to agree\r\nnot to renounce the old religion. To this must be added another reason,\r\nviz., that although the greater part of the clergy, more especially the\r\nbishops, approved the old religion, yet many of the nobility approved\r\nthe new one.[302]\r\n\r\nEven more favorable action toward the Huguenots might have been taken\r\nif Catherine’s caution and her fear of antagonizing the Guises too\r\nmuch had not acted as a restraint. The pardon of the government was\r\ntheoretically not understood to be granted to those who _preached_ the\r\nCalvinistic doctrine, nor to the King’s judges who had authority in\r\nthe cities and provinces of France who espoused it. But it was tacitly\r\nadmitted that no one was to be prosecuted for heresy on this account.\r\nIn Orleans the people worshiped in Huguenot form and in Paris—wonder\r\nof wonders—_Catholic_ preachers were admonished to cease inveighing\r\nagainst “Lutherans” and Huguenots, and not to speak against their sects\r\nor their opinions—an order generally interpreted as consent from the\r\nPrivy Council for all to follow such opinions about faith as most\r\npleased their ideas.[303]\r\n\r\nA corollary to the question of religion was that touching the\r\ngovernment of the church. Several excellent ordinances were passed for\r\nreforming the abuses of the church, particularly for preventing the\r\nsale of benefices. The election of the bishops was taken out of the\r\nKing’s direct jurisdiction and remitted to the clergy, and to satisfy\r\nthe people it was added that twelve noblemen and twelve commoners\r\ntogether with the governor and judges of the city in which a bishop was\r\nto be elected were to unite with the clergy in election, giving laymen\r\nthe same authority as ecclesiastics. Another matter also was determined\r\nwhich was sure to displease the Pope, viz., that moneys should no\r\nlonger be sent to Rome for the annates or for other compositions on\r\naccount of benefices, on the ground that these charges drew large sums\r\nof money from the kingdom and were the cause of its poverty. Even\r\nthe payment of the Peter’s Pence was resented by some. The bishop of\r\nVienne publicly asserted that it was with astonishment and sorrow that\r\nhe observed the patience with which the French people endured these\r\ntaxes “as if,” said he, “the wax and lead of the King was not worth\r\nas much as the lead and the wax of Rome which cost so much.”[304] As\r\nit would have seemed strange were the Pope not first informed of\r\nit, the estates elected one of the presidents of the Parlement to go\r\nto Rome to give an account to the Pope of the matter, not so much to\r\nask it as a favor from the Pope as merely to state the causes which\r\nmoved the government thus to decide. The strong inclination of many\r\nin France whose catholicity could not be impugned, to diminish the\r\npapal authority and assert the old Gallican liberties, is noticeable.\r\nPontifical authority would have been quite at an end if the estates had\r\ndetermined to lay hands on the church property, as was desired by many\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nThe two other questions before the estates were those of justice and\r\nfinance. In the matter of the former nothing was done. For although\r\nthere was universal dissatisfaction, the issue was too complicated,\r\nas all judicial offices were sold, and in order to displace those\r\nwho had bought them it would have been necessary to reimburse the\r\nholders, which could not have been done then. The chances, accordingly,\r\nwere that the administration of justice was likely to go from bad to\r\nworse.[305]\r\n\r\nThe main work of the estates of Orleans had to do with the\r\nreorganization of the finances of the kingdom, the administration of\r\nwhich was intimately connected with the future government. The crown\r\nwas over forty million francs (exceeding eighteen million crowns) in\r\ndebt.[306]\r\n\r\nIt may be well at this point to give a short survey of the financial\r\npolicy of the French crown during the sixteenth century. Under Louis\r\nXII the _taille_, which was the principal tax, and which fell upon\r\nthe peasant, was reduced to about six hundred thousand écus, a sum\r\nlittle superior to the amount originally fixed under Charles VII. It\r\nwas raised by Francis I to two millions. In the time of Louis XII the\r\ntotal revenue amounted to barely two millions; his successor brought\r\nit up to five, the _dîmes_ of the clergy being included.[307] When the\r\nexpenses of the government came to exceed the receipts, Francis I had\r\nrecourse to extraordinary measures, that is to say, to augmentation\r\nof the taxes, to new loans, or to new forms of taxation. In 1539 he\r\nintroduced the lottery from Italy. These extraordinary practices\r\nwere not submitted to any process of approval, not even in the _pays\r\nd’état_. Foreigners were astonished at the ease with which the king\r\nof France procured money at his pleasure. Francis I quadrupled the\r\n_taille_ upon land, and even had the effrontery to raise it to the\r\nfifth power. In general the people paid without murmuring, although in\r\n1535 an insurrection broke out at Lyons on account of an alteration\r\nin the _aides_ demanded by the crown; and in 1542 there was a serious\r\noutbreak at La Rochelle owing to burdensome imposition of the _gabelle_.\r\n\r\nThe author of the new financial measures of 1539 was the chancellor\r\nPoyet, a man of ability, who owed his advancement to the favor\r\nof Montmorency. Several very excellent measures are due to him,\r\npre-eminently numerous ordinances relating to the inalienability of\r\nthe royal domain, which he promulgated as a fundamental law of the\r\nmonarchy, a law which the weak successors of Henry II repudiated. He\r\nalso endeavored to suppress dishonest administration in the provinces.\r\nThus he called to account both the marshal Montjean, whose exactions in\r\nthe Lyonnais produced wide complaint, and Galiot de Genoullac, the sire\r\nd’Acir, whose stealings were enormous. These measures would have had a\r\nsalutary effect if the administration of justice had been independent\r\nand honest in France. Unfortunately Poyet’s reputation for integrity\r\nwas not as great as it should have been in a minister, and his policy\r\nmade him many enemies.\r\n\r\nThe incomes of Francis I, great as they were, did not suffice for Henry\r\nII, the renewal of the war continuing to increase his necessities.\r\nUnder him the increase of the _gabelle_ and the tithes and other\r\nspecial taxes brought the total of the revenues up to six and a half\r\nmillion écus, which did not yet save the King from being reduced to\r\nthe necessity of making alienations and loans, which reached on the day\r\nof his death fourteen millions of écus, about thirty-six millions of\r\nfrancs.[308]\r\n\r\nThe practice of the French government of making loans, a practice which\r\nhas today become familiar to us on a colossal scale, both in Europe and\r\nAmerica, antedates the Hundred Years’ War. St. Louis contracted various\r\nloans with the Templars and Italian merchants for his crusades.[309]\r\nPhilip the Fair borrowed from Italian merchants, from the Templars,\r\nand from his subjects.[310] His war with Edward I of England and his\r\nenterprises in Italy increased the amount, so that his sons inherited a\r\nconsiderable public debt. The Hundred Years’ War enormously increased\r\nit. We have few means of knowing what rates of interest obtained upon\r\nmost of the public loans of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries,\r\nbut they were probably high in most cases. Charles VIII in 1487 fixed\r\nthe rate of interest upon a loan made in Normandy at twelve _deniers\r\ntournois_ for each livre, which would not be over 5 per cent. Seven\r\nyears later, when he was preparing for the Italian campaign, a rate of\r\ntwo sous per livre obtained, which would be approximately equivalent to\r\n10 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn the time of the direct Valois kings, most of the government’s loans\r\nwere arranged in the provinces, as in Normandy and Languedoc. But,\r\nbeginning with Francis I, the city of Paris became increasingly the\r\nplace where the crown obtained financial aid, so much so indeed that\r\nthe supervision of the _rentes_ of the Hôtel-de-Ville became a separate\r\nadministrative bureau of the royal treasury, although it must not be\r\nunderstood that the government’s operations were henceforth exclusively\r\nconfined to Paris; for loans continued to be made wherever possible\r\nwith towns, corporations, the clergy, and private loan brokers and\r\nbankers. These _rentes_ of the capital, it should be understood,\r\nwere technically a substitution of the credit of the city of Paris\r\nfor the somewhat dubious credit of the crown.[311] From that date\r\n(1522) forward in France, government loans took the form of perpetual\r\nannuities, payable at the Hôtel-de-Ville in Paris. But other cities,\r\nsuch as Orleans, Troyes, Toulouse, and Rouen, also furnished the King\r\nwith money in the form of annuities.\r\n\r\nAside from Paris, the church of France was the grand pillar of the\r\ngovernment’s finances, and as the initiation of the _rentes_ is due to\r\nFrancis I, so to this king also is the second expedient to be ascribed.\r\nIn 1516, on the occasion of the _concordat_, Leo X allowed Francis I to\r\nexact a new tenth, theoretically to be distinguished from the _dîme_\r\nof the clergy of France, the pretext being a war projected against the\r\nTurks. The new tithe was levied by the King’s officers alone, on the\r\nbasis of a grand survey of the property of the clergy (_Description\r\ngénérale du bien d’église_) made in this year. In this financial survey\r\nthe tax or quota of each benefice and the total of the tithe in every\r\ndiocese were indicated. Thenceforth it was easy for numerous tithes to\r\nbe levied by the will of the King alone. However, in order to conceal\r\nthe arbitrariness of this conduct, the crown sometimes indicated its\r\npurpose to Rome which issued the necessary validation, but more often\r\nthe King addressed the clergy itself united in assemblies of the\r\nbishops at Paris and in provincial or diocesan assemblies. The consent\r\nof the clergy was nothing but a formality, for the royal authority\r\nfixed in advance the sum to be paid. The diocesan assembly had nothing\r\nto do but distribute the impost. This concession of the Pope was\r\nsuccessively renewed, under different pretexts, for a number of years,\r\nunder the name of a _don caritatif_, and was equivalent to another\r\ntithe, the practice, prolonged year after year, at last hardening\r\ninto a permanent form of taxation required of the clergy, so much so\r\nthat under Henry II receivers of the “gift” were established in every\r\ndiocese.[312]\r\n\r\nWastefulness and bad management characterized the reign of Henry II\r\nfrom the very first. The treasury was soon completely exhausted.\r\nA reserve of four hundred thousand écus d’or, which Francis I had\r\namassed to carry the war into Germany, with little owing save to the\r\nSwiss, payments to whom Francis I had continued in order to prolong\r\nhis alliance with them, was dissipated within a few months, and the\r\ngovernment had resort to increased taxation and the creation of new\r\ntaxes. The _gabelle_ upon salt, from which Poitou, Saintonge, and\r\nGuyenne had hitherto been exempt, and which was now introduced into\r\nthose provinces, raised a terrible revolt which was not crushed until\r\nmuch violence had been done and much blood shed. The renewal of the war\r\nagainst Charles V and the invasion of Lorraine, added to the insatiable\r\ndemands of the court, required new financial expedients. Not less than\r\neighteen times during the twelve years of the reign of Henry II were\r\nthe _échevins_ of Paris called upon to supply the King with sums of\r\nmoney. Four millions and a half were thus demanded of the capital.\r\nIn order to obtain these sums, which the people refused to advance\r\ngratuitously, the King was forced to humiliate himself exceedingly.\r\nThus in 1550, in a general assembly of the sovereign courts of the\r\nclergy and of the bourgeois it was reported that “the King, being\r\nobliged to give money to the English, and not having any money in his\r\ntreasury except mutilated and debased currency which could not be\r\nrecoined, is under the necessity of offering this debased and mutilated\r\ncoin as security for a public loan.” As might be expected, this not\r\nvery tempting offer did not entice the provost of the merchants, much\r\nto the chagrin of the King, who, however, consented to a short delay.\r\nBut three years later Henry II was even less shameless. Although there\r\nwas still just as much unwillingness on the part of the merchants of\r\nthe city to take the King’s notes, this little difficulty was easily\r\novercome by the King’s agents. If the money were not forthcoming, the\r\nsideboards of the wealthy bourgeois of Paris contained enough gold and\r\nsilver plate to answer the purpose, and an edict of February 19, 1553,\r\nordered certain specified persons to bring to the mint their vessels of\r\ngold and of silver, for which the government issued its notes.\r\n\r\nBut Paris was not the only city which was almost incessantly called\r\nupon to supply the King’s needs. Each year, and even each month, was\r\ncharacterized by a new demand, and numbers of the cities of France\r\nwere from time to time taxed for sums which were not secured, however,\r\nwithout resistance to the royal treasurers. Lyons, which was at this\r\nepoch the seat of a commerce greater even than that of Paris, was\r\nmore often mulcted than any other in this way. Conduct so high-handed\r\nnaturally resulted not only in creating bitterness against the\r\ngovernment, but demoralized trade as well. The credit of the government\r\ndepreciated to such an extent that the rate of interest rose as high as\r\n14 per cent.[313] During the twelve years of Henry II’s reign a greater\r\namount in taxes had been imposed upon the people of France than in the\r\nfourscore years preceding, besides which many of the crown lands had\r\nbeen dissipated. Naturally “hard times” prevailed.[314]\r\n\r\nSome members of the States-General were for bringing the officers of\r\nfinance to account and obliging them to submit the list of all the\r\ngrants which had been made in favor of the great and influential at\r\nthe court of Henry II. But the cooler element thought that this policy\r\ncould not be followed out on account of the powerful position of those\r\ninvolved and that occasion for new commotions only would ensue.[315]\r\nInstead, retrenchment was resolved upon. The stipends of the gentlemen\r\nof the King’s household and of the _gens de finance_ were reduced\r\none-half and all pensions were abridged one-third,[316] except in the\r\ncase of foreigners in the King’s service, who were supposed to have\r\nno other source of income. This last provision created an outcry, on\r\nthe ground that foreigners could only be so employed in time of war,\r\nsave in the case of the Scotch Guard.[317] Even this was cut down,\r\none hundred men-at-arms and one hundred archers being dismissed. The\r\nroyal stables and mews were also broken up and the horses and falcons\r\nsold.[318]\r\n\r\nSomething more constructive than mere economy, however, was necessary,\r\nand the burden of paying the King’s debts fell heaviest upon the\r\nclergy. This was partly owing to the great wealth of the church; partly\r\nto the fact that the clergy had rushed in where others feared to tread,\r\nand, officiously asserting their superiority in matters of state as\r\nwell as of church, had proceeded to examine the royal accounts, which\r\nthe nobles and the commons were too wary to inspect.[319] The nobles\r\ntook the ground that they were not concerned in the matter of paying\r\nthe King’s debts, claiming that they paid their dues to the crown by\r\npersonal service in war time.[320]\r\n\r\nAs far back as the assembly at Fontainebleau far-sighted councilors\r\nof the king had pointed out that the revenues of the church would\r\nhave to be made to do duty for the government, and intercourse with\r\nRome had been under way looking to such an arrangement.[321] The Pope\r\nwas not as bitterly opposed to such a policy as one might at first be\r\nled to think, for he was thoroughly frightened at the prospect of a\r\nnational council of the French clergy being convened in France and was\r\ndisposed to be accommodating. But of course a roundabout method had\r\nto be resorted to, for the church would not have suffered a barefaced\r\ntaxation of ecclesiastical revenues by the political authority. The\r\nresulting arrangement was in the nature of a political “deal.” Upon the\r\nunderstanding that no French council should be convened, the French\r\ncrown was permitted to appropriate three hundred and sixty thousand\r\nducats _per annum_ for five years from the incomes of the church,[322]\r\nthe condition of the subsidy, theoretically, being that France was to\r\nmaintain a fleet to serve against the Turks.[323]\r\n\r\nWhen these things had been done and the King had received in writing\r\nthe _doléances_ and requests of the three orders, the States-General\r\nwere prorogued[324] until the first of May, to meet at Pontoise\r\nin order to complete the settlement of affairs,[325] for time was\r\nnecessary to make the arrangements with the church, since the prelates\r\npresent had not been commissioned to enter into such a compact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE FORMATION OF THE TRIUMVIRATE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe factional rivalry which had been engendered during the course of\r\nthe session of the States-General at Orleans was so great that this\r\ndiscord, combined with the agitation prevailing on account of religion,\r\nseemed ominous of civil war, and “every accident was interpreted\r\naccording to the passions of the persons concerned.”[326] The affair\r\nof the custody of the seal created bitter feeling for a time between\r\nthe duke of Guise and the king of Navarre, until the former out of\r\npolicy and the latter either from policy or lack of courage, affected\r\nto become reconciled. The Guises realized that they had suffered a\r\nserious blow politically through the death of Francis II and Catherine\r\nwas shrewd enough to know that while she controlled the seal, she was\r\nthe keeper of the King’s authority. The prince of Condé was a double\r\nsource of friction. In the first place, his trial for treason was\r\nstill pending before the Parlement of Paris.[327] The queen mother\r\nwas anxious to have the cause settled out of court, for if condemned\r\n(which was unlikely) the whole Bourbon family would be disgraced as\r\nformerly through the treason of the constable Bourbon in 1527, and if\r\nacquitted, the prince would not rest until he had been avenged of his\r\nenemies. Accordingly, she caused a letter to be written in the King’s\r\nname instructing the Parlement to dismiss the case. But the mettlesome\r\nspirit of the prince resented this process, and his discontent was\r\nincreased to furious anger when the duke of Guise recommended that all\r\nthe evidence be burned and prosecution be dropped, although his opinion\r\nwas that legally Condé could not be acquitted as the trial so far had\r\nproved him to have been implicated in the revolt of Lyons.[328] To\r\nboth parties Catherine de Medici steadily replied that she had written\r\nthe letter in order to adjust the affairs of the prince of Condé to\r\nhis honor and to the satisfaction of all, and that the seal was in\r\nher hands. On March 15 the prince was readmitted to the Privy Council;\r\nbut the Parlement was not disposed to drop the case so easily and\r\ndeliberated at length upon the matter, finally on June 13, going on\r\nrecord, in a delicately balanced pronouncement which was intended to\r\nplease all parties concerned and satisfied none.[329]\r\n\r\nA new source of friction was the vacant government of Champagne\r\nwhich the queen gave to the duke of Nemours. This offended Antoine\r\nof Navarre, because he wanted to have it conferred upon the prince\r\nof Condé.[330] To these dissensions, finally, must be added a recent\r\nruling of the Privy Council, in compliance with one of the resolutions\r\nof the States-General, that all bishops, including the cardinals, were\r\nto return to their sees.[331] This regulation eliminated some of the\r\nleaders of both parties, the cardinal of Lorraine on the one hand and\r\nthe cardinal de Châtillon on the other, to the discomfiture of both\r\nparties. Only the cardinal Tournon, whose great age made him harmless\r\nand who really wanted to pass the rest of his life in retirement, and\r\nthe cardinal of Bourbon whose easy disposition also made him harmless,\r\nwere permitted to stay with the court.\r\n\r\nPhilip II of Spain had been an attentive follower of all that had\r\nhappened in France since the early autumn of 1560 and had been kept\r\nthoroughly informed by his indefatigable ambassador. His disquietude\r\nover the death of Francis II and the new direction of affairs in France\r\nwas so great[332] that in January Philip sent Don Juan de Manrique,\r\nhis grand master of artillery, to Orleans, ostensibly to perform the\r\noffice of condolence and congratulation,[333] but in reality to win\r\nover the constable, to harden the policy of the French government\r\ntoward the Huguenots, to persuade it against the project of a national\r\ncouncil,[334] and to promote Philip’s purposes regarding the marriage\r\nof Mary Queen of Scots, to Don Carlos, Philip’s son.\r\n\r\nCatherine de Medici soon divined both the purpose and the danger, and\r\nher alarm was correspondingly great, because the increasing confusion\r\nin the realm on account of religion every day made Spanish intervention\r\nmore possible,[335] One of two results seemed certain to happen: either\r\nthat things would end with the Huguenots having churches in which they\r\ncould preach, read, and perform their rites according to their doctrine\r\nwithout hindrance, as they had temporarily obtained churches by the\r\ndeclaration of Fontainebleau, at the end of August, in compliance with\r\nthe resolution presented by the admiral; or else that obedience to the\r\nPope and to the Catholic rites would be enforced at the point of the\r\nsword, and a manifest and certain division in the kingdom would result,\r\nwith civil war as the consequence. When Francis II died, a great number\r\nwho had fled to Geneva and Germany after the conspiracy of Amboise\r\ncame back to France. For the government of Charles IX had inaugurated\r\nthe new reign by a declaration of toleration (January 7, 1561) which,\r\nalthough Calvin disapproved it,[336] may yet with reason be regarded\r\nas a liberal edict. The Protestants were not slow to profit by the\r\nchange, and flocked back from Switzerland and Germany and resumed\r\ntheir propaganda, one phase of which was a vilification of Rome and\r\nthe Guises to such an extent that the King protested to the Senate of\r\nGeneva regarding their abuse.[337] Paris soon abounded with Huguenot\r\npreachers from Geneva, who relied upon the division in the council\r\nor the protection of persons in power for the maintenance of the new\r\nedict.[338]\r\n\r\nIn some provinces, such as Normandy,[339] Touraine, Poitou,\r\nGascony,[340] and the greater part of Languedoc, Dauphiné, and\r\nProvence, congregations and meetings were openly held. Guyenne save\r\nBordeaux, was badly infected with heresy.[341] The new religion\r\npenetrated so deeply that it affected every class of persons, even the\r\necclesiastical body itself, not only priests, friars, and nuns, but\r\neven bishops and many of the principal prelates. Among all classes\r\nthere were Huguenot sympathizers, the nobility perhaps more manifestly\r\nthan any other class.[342] The congregations of Rouen and Dieppe sent\r\nto the King for license to preach the word of God openly. In Dieppe the\r\nCalvinists once a day met in a great house, “of men, women and children\r\nabove 2,000 in company.”[343] There were Huguenot outbursts at Angers,\r\nMans, Beauvais, and Pontoise, in April, and at Toulouse in June.[344]\r\nAt Beauvais when the cardinal of Châtillon, who was bishop there,\r\ncaused the Calvinist service to be conducted and communion administered\r\nin his chapel, “after the manner of Geneva,” the canons and many of the\r\npeople “assembled to good numbers to have wrought their wicked wills\r\nupon the cardinal.” Some were hurt and killed in the trouble, and one\r\npoor wretch was brought before the cardinal’s gate and burned.[345] A\r\nsimilar riot took place in Paris, on April 28, in the evening, near the\r\nPré-aux-Clercs.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these excesses things took a sterner turn. A new measure\r\ninterdicted Huguenot meetings, even in private houses; and all persons\r\nof every condition _in Paris_ were required to observe the Catholic\r\nreligion.[346] The attitude of Paris was ominous for the future. The\r\npopulace was wholly Catholic and hostile to religious change,[347] and\r\nwas strongly supported by the Sorbonne and the Parlement.[348] The\r\nSorbonne freely let it be understood that it would never obey any order\r\nissued to the injury of the Catholic religion, asserting that whenever\r\nthe crown changed faith and religion, the people were absolved from\r\nthe oath of fealty and were not bound to obey.[349] The words “civil\r\nwar” were on the lips of all who were attentively observing events.\r\n“Between the two parties, justice is so little feared,” wrote the duke\r\nof Bedford, “and policy has so little place that greater things are to\r\nbe dreaded.”[350]\r\n\r\nThe responsibility for the government’s vacillation at this season\r\nis not to be imputed wholly to Catherine de Medici.[351] It is to\r\nbe remembered that France was under a double regency, and that the\r\nweakness of the king of Navarre materially embarrassed affairs. At this\r\nmoment he seemed to be inclined toward the faith of Rome in the hope\r\nof conciliating Philip II of Spain, in order to recover the kingdom\r\nof Navarre. The Spanish ambassador and the Guises naturally made the\r\nmost of his aspiration, the former telling Antoine that although it was\r\nimpossible to obtain what he claimed from His Catholic Majesty by mere\r\nforce, he might make a fair agreement with Philip by maintaining France\r\nin the true faith.[352]\r\n\r\nDuring these months of tension and tumult, the ambassador worked out\r\na scheme, which in principle was that of Philip II, but the details\r\nwere of Chantonnay’s own arrangement. The aim was to form a group of\r\ninfluential persons at the court, who should begin by complaints of\r\nthe government’s policy and then proceed to threats and dark hints\r\nof the displeasure of Spain, finally presenting a bold front to\r\nCatherine, and compelling her to abandon her policy of temporizing\r\nand moderation. The constable Montmorency was the objective leader\r\nof this cabal, and his persuasion to the enterprise was one of the\r\nsecret purposes of the mission of Don Juan de Manrique. While this\r\nenvoy bore letters expressing Philip’s esteem to all the most notable\r\nCatholics at the French court, there was a distinction between them.\r\nThe king of Spain wrote in common to the duke of Guise, the constable,\r\nthe duke of Montpensier, the chancellor, and the marshals St. André\r\nand Brissac,[353] and a joint note to the cardinals of Lorraine\r\nand Tournon.[354] But Montmorency and St. André each also received\r\na separate letter. The discrimination shows the wonderfully keen\r\npenetration of Philip’s ambassador, for these two were destined to be\r\ntwo of the three pillars of the famous Triumvirate.[355] In reply the\r\ncardinal of Lorraine hastened to inform Philip II of his deep interest\r\nin maintaining the welfare of Catholicism.[356] But it required time\r\nand adroitness to overcome the constable’s prejudice against Spain, and\r\nhis attachment to his nephews.[357]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, before the constable was persuaded, the cabal made\r\nformidable headway by winning Claude de l’Aubespine to its cause. This\r\npaved the way for an action which, if Catherine de Medici could have\r\nknown it, would have thrown her into consternation indeed. For Claude\r\nde l’Aubespine’s brother Sebastian, the bishop of Limoges, was Charles\r\nIX’s ambassador in Spain. On April 4, 1561, the latter addressed a\r\nsecret letter to Philip II of Spain describing the turmoil in France\r\nand thanking him, in the queen’s name, for the “bons et roiddes\r\noffices” of Chantonnay.[358]\r\n\r\nCoincident with this event, things in France had come to a head\r\nprecisely as Philip and his ambassador had planned to have them. At\r\nthis juncture Montmorency took a decisive stand. When the constable\r\nsaw that meat was being freely eaten during these Lenten days; that\r\nProtestant service was held in the chambers of the admiral and the\r\nprince of Condé; that Catherine de Medici invited Jean de Montluc,\r\nthe heretic bishop of Valence, to preach at court on Easter Sunday,\r\nthe old warrior’s spirit rose in revolt. In vain his eldest son, the\r\nmarshal Montmorency, pleaded that his father’s fears were exaggerated\r\nand his prejudices too deep-seated. The old man was firm in his\r\nconvictions, in which he was sustained by his wife, Madeleine of Savoy,\r\na bitter adversary of Calvinism.[359] Moreover, the political as well\r\nas religious demands of the Huguenot party, especially the demands\r\nof certain of the local estates, which advocated drastic reform,\r\nalarmed him. The whole power of the political Huguenots was directed\r\nagainst the constable, the duke of Guise, the cardinal of Lorraine,\r\nand the marshals Brissac and St. André, the leaders of the party being\r\ndetermined to call them to account for their peculations during the\r\nreign of Henry II and his successor, and to force them to surrender the\r\nexcessive grants which had been given them.[360]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of April 6, 1561, Montmorency, after having expostulated\r\nwith the queen, invited the duke of Guise, the duke de Montpensier the\r\nprince of Joinville, the marshal St. André, and the cardinal Tournon to\r\ndine with him. In his apartments that famous association named by the\r\nHuguenots the Triumvirate, in which the constable, Guise, and St. André\r\nwere principals, was formed.[361]\r\n\r\nThe preparations of the Guises during the former year enabled the\r\nTriumvirate rapidly to lay its plans. Spanish, Italian, German, and\r\nSwiss forces could be counted upon and procured within a very short\r\ntime. These forces were to be divided under the command of the duke\r\nof Aumale and the three marshals, Brissac, Termes, and St. André. In\r\norder to support these troops, the Catholic clergy were to be assessed\r\naccording to the incomes they enjoyed; cardinals 4,000 to 5,000 livres\r\nper annum; bishops 1,000 to 1,200; abbots 300 to 400, priors 100 to\r\n120; and so on down to chaplains, whose annual stipend was but 30\r\nlivres, and who were only assessed a few sous. But as some immediate\r\nmeans were necessary, the gold and the silver of some of the churches,\r\nand the treasure of certain monasteries was to be appropriated at once,\r\nreceipts being given for the value of the gold taken, and promise being\r\nmade that reimbursement would be made shortly out of the confiscations\r\nmade from the heretics.[362]\r\n\r\nCatherine de Medici’s plan to govern through the constable\r\nMontmorency and the admiral,[363] leaving Antoine of Navarre only\r\nnominal authority, received an abrupt shock when the Triumvirate was\r\nestablished. Her policy partook of both doubt and fear, and vacillated\r\nmore than ever.[364]\r\n\r\nBut more formidable than the project to organize insurrection at\r\nhome, thus promoted by the Triumvirate, was the foreign policy it\r\nadopted. The Triumvirate formally appealed to Philip II for aid.[365]\r\nThe response was not slow in forthcoming, though the royal word was\r\nprudently couched in vague terms.[366] To make matters worse, Antoine\r\nof Navarre inclined more than ever toward the faith of Rome in the hope\r\nof conciliating Philip II of Spain.[367]\r\n\r\nTo a man less vain and gullible than Antoine of Bourbon such a\r\nproposition, upon its very face, as the restoration of Navarre, would\r\nhave appeared to have been preposterous. Aside from the blow to its\r\nprestige which any loss of territory entails upon a nation, it is\r\nonly necessary to look at the position of Spanish Navarre to perceive\r\nthat Spain could better afford to lose a war abroad than to part with\r\nthis key to the passes of the western Pyrenees. There is no need to\r\nrelate at length the story of Antoine’s alternate hopes and fears, of\r\nhis great expectations, and of the empty promises made him.[368] The\r\noffice Antoine held, not the man, made him important to France and\r\nSpain. For this reason, he was alternately wheedled and cajoled, mocked\r\nand threatened, for more than a year; and all the time the pitiable\r\nweakling shifted and vacillated in his policy.[369] It is amazing to\r\nsee how successfully Antoine was led along by the dexterous suggestions\r\nof Chantonnay, and the evasive answers of Philip II. It was a delicate\r\ngame to play, for there was continual fear lest he would discover\r\nthat he was being made the dupe of Spain, and prevail upon the queen\r\nmother and the prince of Condé to join him in avenging his wrongs, a\r\nnot impossible development, as Granvella observed, “considering that\r\nprudence does not always preside over the actions of men.”[370]\r\n\r\nThe game was the more difficult because Antoine wanted the restoration\r\nof his kingly title more than anything else. If he had been willing to\r\nbecome vassal to Spain, as Chantonnay said to St. André, there were a\r\nthousand ways to satisfy him. But Spain could not think of alienating\r\nany of her provinces, least of all any frontier possession like Navarre\r\nor Roussillon.[371] Time and again the prince of Condé told his brother\r\nhe was a fool to be so wheedled, and Jeanne d’Albret sarcastically said\r\nthat she would let her son go to mass when his father’s inheritance\r\nwas restored.[372] When the game was likely to be played out, and\r\nAntoine, discovering that fine words did not butter parsnips, began\r\nto complain or boldly to bluster,[373] a possible substitute for the\r\nkingdom of Navarre which Antoine did not want to hold as a Spanish\r\ndependency[374] was suggested. At one moment it was Sienna; at another\r\nthe county of Avignon; at a third the crown of Denmark—to be gotten\r\nthrough the influence of the Guises. The most alluring offer in\r\nAntoine’s eyes, however, was Sardinia.[375] In return for the crown\r\nof Sardinia, Antoine was willing to leave all the fortresses of the\r\nisland in Spain’s possession; and to put his children in Philip’s hands\r\nas hostages.[376]\r\n\r\nThis digression has somewhat anticipated the progress of events.\r\nCharles IX had been crowned at Rheims on May 15 (Ascension Day).[377]\r\nThe declared majority and the coronation of her son seems to have\r\ngiven Catherine new courage, for in spite of the menace implied in the\r\nformation of the Triumvirate, she still labored in the interest of the\r\nHuguenot cause. On June 13, as we have seen, the definite exoneration\r\nof the prince of Condé was pronounced by the Parlement of Paris,[378]\r\nand in the following August an outward reconciliation, at least, was\r\neffected between the prince and the duke of Guise.[379]\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the positive attitude of the queen mother and the\r\nvacillation of the king of Navarre, the Huguenots urged the cause\r\nof toleration and presented a request to the King on June 11, 1561,\r\nthrough the deputies of the churches dispersed throughout the realm of\r\nFrance.[380] They declared that the reports of their refusing to pay\r\nthe taxes and being seditious were false and calumnious; they begged\r\nthe King to cause all persecutions against them to cease; that he would\r\nliberate those of them who were in prison, and that he would permit\r\nthem to build churches as their numbers were so great that private\r\nhouses would no longer suffice; finally offering to give pledges that\r\nthere would be no sedition in their assemblies, and promising all\r\nlawful obedience.\r\n\r\nThe queen mother referred this petition to the Privy Council, but as\r\nit involved so important a matter the council was of opinion that it\r\nought to be laid before the Parlement as well as to be considered by\r\nthe princes of the blood and all the peers and councilors of the Court\r\nof Parlement.[381] The Catholic party was quite willing to have this\r\ncourse followed, feeling confident that the Parlement in its official\r\ncapacity would refuse to register an edict for such purpose. But\r\nL’Hôpital[382] and Coligny had hopes that the interest and authority\r\nof the princes of the blood and other persons of influence might carry\r\nit through the Parlement after all.[383] However, in the end nothing\r\npositive was concluded, final resolution being deferred until a\r\ncolloquy of the bishops and other clergy, who were convoked at Poissy,\r\nnear St. Germain, for the end of the month, took place.[384] Meanwhile\r\na tentative ordinance—the Edict of July, similar to the Edict of\r\nRomorantin—was to obtain. This gave the church, as before, entire\r\ncognizance of the crime of heresy and deprived the Parlement, the\r\nbailiffs, seneschals, and other judges of any jurisdiction. In every\r\ncase local ecclesiastical courts had to act first; banishment was to be\r\nthe severest punishment for heresy; false accusers were to be punished\r\nin the same way that the accused would have been if really guilty;\r\namnesty was granted for past offenses; and firearms were forbidden\r\nto be carried in towns or elsewhere, with certain exceptions, under\r\na penalty of 50 gold crowns.[385] Within a short time, accordingly,\r\nthe Protestant assemblies appeared as frequently as before, although\r\nthe Calvinist clergy seemed to have become more discreet in their\r\nutterances.[386]\r\n\r\nThis cleverly designed edict, while seeming to pronounce judgment,\r\nreally avoided the question at issue. There was sufficient leeway still\r\nfor the holding of Protestant assemblies, and moreover, even though\r\necclesiastical affairs were to be referred to the spiritual courts,\r\nthe Huguenots were protected by a saving clause (except for offenses\r\ncognizable by the secular power).[387] Such qualified toleration, so\r\nguardedly given, was probably all that might with safety have been\r\ngranted to the Huguenots at this early date. But they were far from\r\nseeing things in this light. The hotheads among them, in their meetings\r\nand in public places, used the most violent language in detraction of\r\nthe Catholic church and its sacraments.[388] In some places popular\r\nfeeling against priests was so strong that they were compelled, for the\r\nsafety of their lives, to disguise their costumes and not to wear the\r\nclerical habit abroad, nor long hair, nor have the beard shaved, nor\r\nexhibit any other mark which would indicate that they were priests or\r\nmonks.[389]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE COLLOQUY OF POISSY. THE ESTATES OF PONTOISE. THE EDICT OF JANUARY,\r\n1562\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1561, France saw two separate assemblies convene: the\r\nadjourned session of the States-General at Pontoise and the conference\r\nof the leaders of the two religions at Poissy. In a sense the cause\r\nof the political Huguenots was represented in the former, that of the\r\nreligious Huguenots in the latter, although the deliberations of the\r\ntwo assemblies were finally combined in an instrument known as the\r\nAct of Poissy. The elections in the provinces, each of which sent\r\nup two[390] representatives from each bailiwick of the kingdom, had\r\nenabled the opposition to go on record,[391] so that the crown had\r\nearly intimation of the sort of legislation that was likely to be\r\ndemanded. The business of the estates was to find a way out of the\r\nfinancial difficulties which overwhelmed the King.[392]\r\n\r\nThe spokesman of the third estate, one Jean Bretaigne, mayor of Autun,\r\nafter a tedious prologue copiously laden with biblical and classic\r\nlore, at last came to the pith of things: he summed up in a paragraph\r\nof portentous dimensions the burden imposed upon the people by war and\r\nthe extravagance of the court during the past twenty years, declaring\r\nthat the people were so penniless that they had nothing to give the\r\nKing, “save a good and loyal will.” Things had come to such a pass\r\nthat mere economy and retrenchment, nor even an honest and effective\r\nadministration, although that was demanded and was promised by the\r\nKing, could save the future.[393] The immense resources of the clergy\r\nmust be made to restore the dilapidated finances of the monarchy;\r\nthe church must come to the material rescue of the state, as in the\r\ndays of Charles Martel. The entire revenue he argued, must be taken\r\nof all offices, benefices, and ecclesiastical dignities not actually\r\nofficiated either in person or in a titular capacity, the Knights of\r\nRhodes and the Hospitalers of St. James included; all the fruits,\r\nalso, of benefices in litigation which the collators were accustomed\r\nto take during the time of litigation should be appropriated by the\r\nstate, as well as the moneys of deceased bishops and monks. Moreover,\r\none-quarter of the income should be taken of all beneficiaries actually\r\nresident in their benefices, in cases where the revenue was from 500\r\nto 1,000 livres; of those having a revenue of 1,000 to 3,000 livres,\r\none-third; of those with incomes running from 3,000 to 6,000 livres,\r\none-half; of those ranging from 6,000 to 12,000 livres, two-thirds.\r\nThose of the clergy whose incomes exceeded 12,000 livres and above were\r\nto be permitted to retain 4,000 livres, the surplus being applied to\r\nliquidate the King’s debts, save in cases where the beneficiaries were\r\nbishops, archbishops, primates, and cardinals, to whom 6,000 livres\r\nrevenue was to be allowed. As to the monastic orders, their whole\r\ntreasury and revenues were to be appropriated, save enough for their\r\nsupport, for the maintenance of their buildings, and for charity. And\r\nthis was not all: all houses, gardens, and real property within either\r\ncities or faubourgs not actually employed for ecclesiastical uses, were\r\nto be confiscated by the government; the clergy were to be made to pay\r\ntaxes upon the rich furniture and works of art or adornment given them\r\nto enjoy either for a length of years or in perpetuity. Finally, all\r\nlands providing revenues, either in money or in kind, as oil, wine, and\r\ngrain, in case of being let to contract or change of control, were to\r\nbe declared redeemable. If these measures should prove insufficient,\r\nthen recourse must be had to more drastic means, namely the direct\r\nsale of the property of the church. Twenty-six million livres’ worth\r\nof this could be readily sold, the speaker argued, which would be no\r\nmore than one-third of the church’s possession; the remainder should\r\nbe administered by a trustworthy commission, which, after paying the\r\nstipends of the clergy in the amounts above indicated, should devote\r\nthe balance to the payment of the debts of the crown.[394]\r\n\r\nThis formidable programme, which suggests the policy actually followed\r\nby France in 1789, in spite of the hot declaration of the constable\r\nthat the speaker presenting it ought to be hanged,[395] proved so\r\nreasonable that the government, without going to the extreme proposed,\r\nsaw that the moment was a favorable one to secure important aid from\r\nthe clergy. The clergy, on the other hand, were sharp enough to\r\nsee that in order to save their property, they would have to make\r\nsacrifice of a portion of it. At first they offered the crown a bonus\r\nof ten million livres, which it refused as being too small a sum, and\r\ndemanded a greater subsidy.[396] A temporary settlement at last was\r\nmade on the basis of 1,600,000 livres annual revenue to be levied upon\r\nthe vineyards of the clergy, in order to relieve the King’s present\r\nneeds.[397] But something more fundamental than this had to be done,\r\nfor these measures only supplied the King with funds for current\r\nexpenses, and did not admit of redemption of the debt or resumption of\r\nthe crown lands, which had been mortgaged for about thirty millions of\r\nfrancs. This matter was the subject of investigation and debate through\r\nthe ensuing November and December. Finally, a scheme was worked out\r\nwhereby the royal domain was all to be redeemed by the clergy within\r\nsix years, and the remainder of the debt to be discharged within\r\nanother six.[398]\r\n\r\nThe contract of Poissy-Pontoise presents two important stipulations:\r\none, a gift of money to the King; second, the repurchase by the clergy\r\nof the domains of the crown and the redemption of the debt. If this\r\ncontract had been observed, it would have rendered the other assemblies\r\nof the clergy useless, but the failure to execute it made necessary the\r\nsubsequent assemblies of 1563 and 1567, which established a rule of\r\nperiodicity, as it were, and fixed the next session at 1573. By 1567,\r\nthe clergy had fulfilled its first obligation and declared itself ready\r\nto resume the second by giving to the provost of the merchants and\r\nto the _échevins_ of Paris the guarantees desired for the redemption\r\nof the _rentes_. But the King at the same time insisted upon the\r\ncontinuation of the subsidy of 1,600,000 livres. The clergy protested,\r\ndemanding his adherence to the contract of Poissy. The crown enforced\r\ncontinuation, but as “an easement” waived claim to the “secular tithe”\r\nheretofore exacted, and granted to the clergy, for the first time, the\r\nright to collect taxes by its own agents, and the right to judge in a\r\nsovereign capacity all cases which might arise from these financial\r\nmatters. The government observed this convention no better than the\r\nfirst, and in addition to extraordinary subventions—two million livres\r\nin 1572, nearly half of which was squandered by the duke of Anjou in\r\nPoland—resorted to compulsory alienations of church property, as in\r\n1563, 1568, 1574, which were made upon order of the King, without\r\nrecourse to papal affirmation. Purchasers were not wanting for the\r\nnew credit. The rate of interest fell to 5 per cent. in the autumn of\r\n1561 as a result of these expedients, and, provided civil war could\r\nbe averted, it seemed probable that the dilapidated finances might be\r\nrehabilitated.[399]\r\n\r\nSimultaneous with the sitting of the estates at Pontoise to settle\r\nthe financial issue, the religious issue was being debated by the\r\ndoctrinal leaders of Catholicism and Calvinism, at Poissy.[400] This\r\nsolemn assembly had been summoned in June to meet on the second of\r\nthe following month,[401] in spite of the opposition of the clergy\r\nand Spain, who warned Catherine that such a concession would lead to\r\ndisaster.[402] But delay ensued, and the assembly did not actually\r\nconvene until September, for the members were slow in coming.[403] The\r\nconditions governing the meeting at Poissy were published in council\r\non August 8, namely, that the clergy should not be umpires; that the\r\nprinces of the blood should preside at the disputation, and that the\r\ndifferent proceedings should be faithfully recorded by trustworthy\r\npersons.[404] With respect to the other matters the Calvinists were\r\nrequired to make some concessions in order to avoid the reproach of\r\nseeming to evade the colloquy. While awaiting the formal opening of the\r\nconference at Poissy, Beza was invited by the court to speak before the\r\nKing, the queen mother, the king of Navarre, and the Council. He was\r\nlistened to with great attention by all until he began to deny the Real\r\nPresence, when the Catholic party tried to stop his address, exclaiming\r\nthat it was blasphemy, and Beza and his partisans would certainly have\r\nbeen ejected if their opponents had not been restrained by the royal\r\nauthority and compelled to listen to the end. At its conclusion the\r\ncardinal Tournon exhorted the King to continue firm in the faith of his\r\nancestors,[405] and not to permit France to be reduced to the Swiss\r\ncantonal system.[406]\r\n\r\nMany of the clergy said that it was not pertinent for the colloquy to\r\ndetermine these points, but that it was for the General Council to\r\ndecide; moreover, it was argued that as the delegates of the Spanish\r\nclergy would shortly be coming through France on their way to Trent,\r\nwhy should not they assist as well as the others?[407] Catherine, it\r\nis said, had intended that there should be no disputation about dogma.\r\nBut there is some reason to believe that she confounded dogma with the\r\nrites and observances of the church,[408] and it is certain that the\r\nHuguenots were determined to push their privilege of free speech to\r\nthe very limit. Indeed, the conditions predicated by Beza formed the\r\nsubstance of a petition presented by the Reformed leaders to Charles\r\nIX.[409]\r\n\r\nWhen the conference met a great attempt to maintain secrecy was made.\r\nNo one was permitted to enter except those who had been formally\r\nappointed;[410] the duke of Guise carried the keys to the conference\r\nhall, and careful search was made at the beginning of each sitting to\r\nfind any who might be hid.[411]\r\n\r\nThe principal points in dispute turned upon the use of images; the\r\nadministration of the sacrament of baptism; the communion; the mass;\r\nthe laying-on of hands and the vocation of ministers, and finally the\r\nconsideration of a possible accord in doctrine, in which points the\r\nusages of the primitive church and the reasons of separation were\r\ninvolved.[412]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COLLOQUY OF POISSY\r\n\r\n(Tortorel and Perissin)]\r\n\r\nOn the second day of the conference (September 16) the cardinal of\r\nLorraine spoke, dwelling upon these principal points: first, that the\r\nKing, being a member of the church and not its head, could not set\r\nhimself up as a judge in matters of religion and faith, but was subject\r\nto the church like every other Christian; second, the definition of the\r\nauthority of the church was extended even over princes.[413]\r\n\r\nBefore long, however, it became evident, both that the attempt to\r\nreconcile the Catholic and the Calvinist parties was an impossibility,\r\nand that the government’s policy of accommodation was exciting\r\ndiscontent.[414] The demands of the Huguenots, based on Beza’s\r\narguments, were as follows:\r\n\r\n1. That bishops, abbots, and other ecclesiastics should not be\r\nconstituted in any way judges of the Huguenots, in view of the fact\r\nthat they were their opponents.\r\n\r\n2. That all points of difference be judged and decided according to\r\nthe simple word of God, as contained in the New and Old Testaments,\r\nsince the Reformed faith was founded on this alone, and that where any\r\ndifficulties arose concerning the interpretation of words, reference\r\nshould be made to the original Hebrew and Greek text.[415]\r\n\r\nThis second article was a rock of contention from the very beginning.\r\nThe whole Catholic doctrine of tradition having equal weight with\r\nScripture was denied in this article. It was manifest, indeed, from the\r\nfirst that three things would _not_ be suffered to be considered: (1)\r\na change of religion; (2) the authority of the Pope; (3) the possible\r\nalienation of church property.[416] This state of things, together\r\nwith the fact that the prolongation of the session entailed great\r\nexpense,[417] brought about a change of plan. Five persons, the bishop\r\nof Valence, the archbishop of Sens, and MM. Salignac, d’Espence, and\r\nBoutellier, were appointed by the queen and agreed to by the clergy,\r\nto confer with five representatives of the Calvinists, viz., Peter\r\nMartyr,[418] Beza, De Gallars, Marborat, and D’Espine.[419] Within ten\r\ndays more the prelates and ministers had ceased to confer and were\r\ntaking their departure.[420] The assembly of Poissy dissolved of itself\r\non October 18, having accomplished nothing,[421] except doctrinally\r\nstill further to disunite the Protestant world, which otherwise might\r\npossibly have had a council of its own, composed of French, Scotch,\r\nEnglish, Germans, Danes, Swiss and Swedes, to face the Council of\r\nTrent.[422]\r\n\r\nTwo days later the cardinal and the duke of Guise departed from the\r\ncourt, in spite of the urgency of the queen mother to have them remain,\r\naccompanied by the dukes of Nemours and Longueville and other great\r\npersonages and mustering six or seven hundred horse. Outwardly there\r\nwas no sign of disaffection. Immediately afterward the constable also\r\nleft, expressing dissatisfaction with the tolerant policy of the\r\ngovernment. It was plain throughout the proceedings at Pontoise (and\r\nat Poissy) that the chancellor of France, L’Hôpital, and the admiral,\r\nhad the chief direction of affairs in their hands, although the queen\r\nmother and the king of Navarre had the greater show of authority.[423]\r\n\r\nThe Vatican had been an anxious observer of affairs in France, and\r\nearly in June, 1561, the Pope had resolved to send the cardinal of\r\nFerrara, Hippolyte d’Este, to France as legate.[424] The principal\r\npoints of his mission to the French court, where he arrived on\r\nSeptember 14, were to entreat the French crown that the annates might\r\nstill remain as the Pope’s revenue; that there might be no change of\r\nreligion and observance in the church; to solicit the King to recognize\r\nthe Council of Trent and to break off the colloquy at Poissy.[425]\r\nBut when the legate presented his credentials, at the instance of the\r\nchancellor, who impugned his powers, the estates protested against\r\nthe entry of any of the Pope’s bulls or letters without the King’s\r\nconsent and seal.[426] The Parlement of Paris went even farther, and\r\nrefused to confirm the King’s letters-patent. But the King’s council\r\noverrode this resolution, and recognized the legate’s credentials,\r\nalthough L’Hôpital steadfastly refused to affix the seal of state to\r\nthe council’s action.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal began his negotiations by offering on the part of the\r\nPope to resign the tenths and subsidies exacted by the church, and\r\npromising all the help His Holiness could give with honor, on condition\r\nthat the resolution of the estates of Orleans, prohibiting payment\r\nof the annates, which the estates of Pontoise had reasserted, should\r\nnot be executed. The nuncio argued that this action was a violation\r\nof the concordat of 1516, and that the principle in the case had been\r\ndecided by the council of Basel, and accepted by Charles VII in the\r\nPragmatic Sanction. Accordingly, the nuncio asked for a revocation\r\nof the actions taken touching the property of the church, and that\r\nthings be restored to the state in which they originally were.[427]\r\nBut the cardinal’s arguments were of no effect. The execution of the\r\nnew law went forward. The first province where it was applied was\r\nGuyenne—within the government of the king of Navarre, then Touraine,\r\nand the Orleannais.[428]\r\n\r\nAn even more interested observer, perhaps, of French affairs than\r\nthe Pope, was Philip of Spain. The progress of heresy in France, the\r\nseizure of the property of the church there, the attitude of the\r\nFrench crown toward the Council of Trent, the uncertainty of Antoine\r\nof Bourbon’s conduct—these were all disquieting facts to the Spanish\r\nruler. Philip curtly told Catherine and her son that her government\r\nmust abandon its policy of weakness and dissimulation, that too many\r\nsouls were being imperiled by her course, and that coercive measures\r\nmust be used.[429] The duke of Alva had the boldness to declare that\r\nunless the government of France revived the rigorous suppressive\r\nmeasures of Henry II, and punished every heretic, His Catholic Majesty\r\nwas resolved to sacrifice the welfare of Spain and even his own life\r\nin order to stamp out a pest which he regarded as menacing to both\r\nFrance and Spain.[430] Singly and together the bishop of the Limoges\r\n(who was still at the Spanish court) and D’Ozances, while deploring\r\nthe malice of the times and “the disasters of which everyone knew,”\r\ntried to justify their government on the ground that Calvinism had\r\nbecome a necessary evil in France and that it was better to give it\r\nqualified toleration than to plunge the country into fire and war.\r\nThey pointed to the deliberations of the assembly of Fontainebleau, to\r\nthe States-General of Orleans, to the _arrêts_ of the Parlement, and\r\nthe findings of Pontoise and Poissy in proof; they asserted that the\r\nqueen mother and the king of Navarre—they were cautious not to style\r\nhim thus in Philip’s presence, however—were “of perfect and sincere\r\nintention” not to let heresy increase in France; “the scandal and\r\noutrage” of heretical preaching never would be permitted in Paris or\r\nat the court, although it was necessary to permit the Protestants to\r\nhave their own worship outside of some of the towns; that the purpose\r\nof the crown was fixed never to change or alter the true religion; that\r\nFrance was not hostile to the Council of Trent, but in her distress was\r\nnaturally impatient; and finally they importuned the king of Spain not\r\nto show his anger, but to give “advice and comfort” for the sake of the\r\nfriendship which existed between their country and his, and for the\r\nrepose of Christendom.[431]\r\n\r\nThe appeal fell upon deaf ears. Philip coldly replied that it was\r\nuseless for France to expect the advice or assistance of Spain so long\r\nas her government tolerated heresy in any degree whatsoever; that those\r\nat the court who were Huguenots, like the admiral and the prince of\r\nCondé, should be sent away forthwith, and all others should be coerced;\r\nthat from the point of view of religion it was blasphemy to permit the\r\nHuguenots to have any places of worship, and from the political point\r\nof view it was suicide to tolerate them, for “there could never be new\r\nthings in religion without loss of obedience to the temporal power,” in\r\nproof of which the King pointed out that in certain of the provinces\r\nof France the people were refusing to pay tithes and taxes, at the\r\nsame time triumphantly asserting that he was better informed of things\r\nhappening in France than in Spain; that as to the Council of Trent, the\r\nGermans would have nothing to do with it and Spain had no need of it,\r\nwhile France was torn by heretical controversy, so that it might well\r\nbe said that the council sat for the benefit of France alone.[432]\r\n\r\nOne of the points upon which Philip II dwelt with earnestness in the\r\ninterviews he granted the two ambassadors of France was the vicious\r\neducation under which Charles IX’s brother Henry, duke of Orleans, was\r\nbeing brought up. He emphatically condemned the Huguenot environment\r\nof the young prince. It did not seem a coincidence therefore, when a\r\nplot was discovered in November to seize the duke of Orleans—afterward\r\nHenry III—who was to have been made _capo di parti_ by the Catholics.\r\nIt was even said the conspirators aimed also to remove the king and\r\nqueen of Navarre, Condé, and the admiral, by poison. The duke of\r\nNemours was charged with being the principal author of it, and was\r\nto have carried the young duke off to Lorraine or Savoy.[433] This\r\nsupposition was given greater probability when the whole company of\r\nthe Guises suddenly left the court and departed for Lorraine. But\r\nCatherine was not yet intimidated, though she prudently dropped the\r\ninvestigation which she had set on foot when she discovered clues\r\nthat led to the Escurial and the Vatican.[434] In spite of the omens,\r\nshe still adhered to a middle course. The government resolved to send\r\ntwenty-five bishops and two archbishops to Trent, although they went\r\n“very unwillingly.”[435] At the same time permission was granted to\r\nthe ministers of the Reformed churches to preach in private houses\r\nor in gardens environed with houses (the erection of churches being\r\nprohibited), if it was done without tumult.[436] At court the ministers\r\nof the Reformed churches preached one day, when the queen of Navarre,\r\nthe prince of Condé, and the admiral would be present. The next\r\nday either some Cordelier, Jesuit, Jacobin, Minim, or other of the\r\ncloistered sects, preached, on which occasion, the King, the queen\r\nmother, the king of Navarre, the cardinal of Ferrara, accompanied\r\nby those who leaned toward the see of Rome, would be present. But\r\nmoderation was exacted of both sects. On one occasion a famous preacher\r\nof the Minims, who had won some credit with the Catholics for his\r\nrailings, was in the night secretly taken from his lodgings and carried\r\nto the court to answer for his rabid utterances.[437]\r\n\r\nBut it was increasingly manifest that events, both within and without\r\nFrance, were passing beyond the grasp of the government. The Huguenots,\r\nsometimes from fear no doubt, but not infrequently for effrontery, went\r\nto their services with pistols and matchlocks, in spite of the laws\r\nagainst the bearing of arms; and they even were bold enough to march\r\nthrough the streets singing their psalms, to the anger and scandal of\r\nCatholic Christians.[438] An outbreak was imminent at any time.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, on October 12, the Protestants assembled together to the\r\nnumber of 7,000 or 8,000 to hear one of their ministers preach, half a\r\nmile from the town. The Catholics thereupon shut the gates to prevent\r\ntheir re-entry. Finding the gates closed, the Protestants forced them,\r\nand many were wounded and some slain on both sides.[439] From the\r\nprovinces word had come in July that the duke of Montpensier, going to\r\nhis house in Touraine for the burial of his mother, and finding numbers\r\nin many towns who made open profession of Calvinism, by virtue of his\r\ngovernorship of that country, imprisoned about one hundred and forty\r\nin Chinon. Whereupon the people, not forgetting his conduct toward\r\nthem in the previous reign, when he razed the houses of several who\r\nwere reported to him to be Huguenots, assembled in great numbers—about\r\n12,000 or 15,000, we are told—surely a great exaggeration, and marched\r\nso fast upon him that he was besieged in his house and forced to\r\nrelease all the prisoners in order to appease the multitude.[440]\r\n\r\nThe organized nature of the Huguenot agitations in various localities,\r\nespecially in southern France, did not escape the keen observation of\r\nPhilip’s ambassador.[441] At Montpellier in Languedoc the Protestant\r\norganizations, by September, had taken the form of a definite league,\r\nwith the sweeping motto: “No mass, no more than at Geneva,” whose\r\noperations were so thorough that many Catholics were on the point of\r\nemigrating to Catalonia.[442]\r\n\r\nQuite as formidable as armed and insurrectionary religion at home was\r\nthe drift of the negotiations of both parties abroad. The formation\r\nof the Triumvirate had been taken as a sign by both parties that the\r\nissue between them was, as in Germany before the Smalkald war, likely\r\nsoon to pass from religious difference and political rivalry into\r\nmilitary combat; and both sides accordingly prepared against this\r\nfatal day. Naturally, the Protestant German princes who had followed\r\nthe proceedings at Poissy with intense interest[443] were the ones\r\nlooked to for assistance by the Huguenots. In May, 1561, the prince\r\nof Condé had sent Hotman to the chief German princes, begging them\r\nnot to desert the cause of the true religion in France and saying\r\nthat Philip II was endeavoring to terrify the queen from making any\r\nconcessions to the Huguenots.[444] The fact that some of these, as\r\nthe count palatine of the Rhine, and the landgrave of Thuringia were\r\nCalvinists, while others were Lutherans, was not an insuperable barrier\r\nto co-operation, although the Lutherans wished that the confession\r\nof Augsburg might first be recognized in France. But the prevailing\r\nopinion was that the adherents of both of the Protestant faiths should\r\nfirst unite in endeavoring to secure freedom of worship and liberty\r\nof conscience in France, and then they might proceed to establish\r\nuniformity of religion, if possible.[445] Two propositions were made to\r\nthe German princes. The first was that if the Guises, or any of their\r\nconfederates, tried to enlist soldiers in Germany, measures should\r\nbe taken to stop the effort; secondly, that if the Guises or their\r\naccomplices resorted to the use of arms against Condé and Coligny and\r\nwere supported by Spain, then assistance should be given them. Some of\r\nthe German princes agreed at once to this latter proposition, provided\r\nthe expenses of such military support were defrayed by the Huguenots;\r\nbut others thought that the matter could only be settled in a general\r\nassembly of the princes. The circle of Huguenot negotiations at this\r\nmoment was a wide one and their prospects were bright. For at this\r\ntime Denmark, too, was suing for French favor. Among the ambassadors\r\nwho came to offer the condolences of their sovereigns for the death of\r\nFrancis II and to congratulate young Charles, had come an envoy of the\r\nDanish king proposing the marriage of his sister to a French prince\r\nand himself to marry Mary Stuart. This proposed Franco-Danish alliance\r\ncould have produced no other effect than to facilitate the Protestant\r\ncause in France.[446] On the other hand, the prospect of Swiss support\r\nof the Catholic cause in France was not good. Aside from the great\r\nexpense this alliance had always entailed, the number of the Catholic\r\ncantons had been diminished by the secession of Glaris, which had\r\nlately gone over to Protestantism, in consequence of which the rest,\r\nseeing themselves weakened, had asked aid from the duke of Savoy and\r\nthe Pope.[447]\r\n\r\nThe Catholics adroitly emphasized the difference between the two\r\nProtestant faiths, with the hope not only of preventing Lutheran\r\nsupport of the Huguenots, but even of securing their aid against the\r\nFrench Calvinists. The duke of Guise went in person to confer with\r\nthe duke of Württemberg at Saverne (February 15, 1562),[448] while\r\nPhilip II redoubled his efforts to alienate the king of Navarre.[449]\r\nThe support of the Spanish monarch was the vital factor in French\r\npolitics. The French Calvinists had no single _most powerful ally_ to\r\nsupport them, such as the Catholic party enjoyed in the assistance of\r\nSpain. England was the only Protestant power capable of being a rival\r\nto Spain, and England was too cautious or too much occupied with home\r\npolitics to risk embroilment abroad.\r\n\r\nBoth Rome and Spain at this moment took a resolute attitude. Shortly\r\nafter the conference of Poissy came to an end, a consistory of the\r\ncuria, on October 10, 1561, had resolved to resist the Protestants in\r\nFrance.[450] The counter-reformation programme deliberated at Trent\r\nrecognized Philip II as the secular head of the movement (“à ceste\r\nfin d’un commun consentement le tout chef et conducteur de toute\r\nl’enterprise”) who was to wheedle or compel the king of Navarre to\r\ncommit himself in favor of the Catholic cause in France, of which the\r\nduke of Guise was to be formally recognized as leader. The Spanish\r\nmonarch was also to bring pressure to bear upon the Emperor to compel\r\nthe Catholic princes of Germany to prevent the Lutherans and Rhenish\r\nCalvinists from supporting the Protestants of France. France must be\r\nsaved from self-ruin for the sake both of religion and the preservation\r\nof other Catholic nations. Time and circumstances would show the hour\r\nof such intervention, but everything must be prepared in advance.[451]\r\n\r\nAside from his inflexible religious convictions, in Philip’s eyes,\r\npolicy also pointed toward Spanish intervention in France. Spain,\r\nSpanish Burgundy, and Flanders were, as Montluc of Valence declared,\r\n“les trois plus belles fleurs de chapeau du roy Philippe;” each of them\r\nbordered France, and France lay between Spain and them, splitting the\r\nSpanish empire like a wedge. Under these circumstances the prevention\r\nof heresy in France was not merely an act of religious duty but an act\r\ndictated by political expediency. Moreover, Spain might territorially\r\nprofit by such a policy. The son of Charles V dreamed of acquiring\r\nducal Burgundy, which his father had failed to secure; the Three\r\nBishoprics might be wrested away from Charles IX, either violently or\r\nas the price of Spanish aid, and joined to Franche Comté they would\r\nmaterially strengthen Spain’s midcontinental road from Lombardy to the\r\nmouths of the Rhine.[452]\r\n\r\nFear of Spain and of the Guises gave Catherine de Medici more anxiety\r\nthan the insurrections of the Huguenots.[453] The government was\r\njustly apprehensive of Philip II’s movements and warned Joyeuse to be\r\non his guard against any effort to throw Spanish troops across the\r\nfrontier.[454] Reinforcements were sent to Calais.[455] At the same\r\ntime more captains and companies were sent to Metz, where Vieilleville,\r\nthe governor, was ordered not to admit anyone known to be a Guisard\r\ninto the city, as the Guises were suspected of wishing to hand it over\r\nto Philip.[456] Precautionary changes were also made in the military\r\nposts, in the case of those known to be well-affected to the Guises,\r\nthe changes all being in favor of the Huguenot party.[457] De Gourdan\r\nwas removed from Calais and the command given to the sieur de Grammont,\r\nwho had married a sister of the vidame de Chartres; the prince de la\r\nRoche-sur-Yon was made king’s lieutenant in Paris; the admiral made\r\ngovernor of Normandy in place of the duke of Bouillon; Condé was sent\r\nto Picardy, where the marshal Brissac had lately resigned on account of\r\nillness.[458]\r\n\r\n“Here is new fire, new green wood reeking, new smoke and much contrary\r\nwind blowing,” wrote Shakerley to Elizabeth’s ambassador, Throckmorton,\r\non December 15, 1561.[459] The words were wisely as well as quaintly\r\nused. From the capital to every edge of France unrest, suspicion,\r\nconspiracy, insurrection prevailed. The Catholic orders began to\r\nfortify the abbeys. Every day Catherine’s determination to maintain an\r\neven balance of the two religions was producing greater tension and\r\nmore heat. Violence was ominously on the increase.[460] Robbery was\r\ncommon under pretense of searching for heretics.[461] In the hope of\r\nbettering things, the crown relieved the prince de la Roche-sur-Yon of\r\nthe lieutenancy and committed it to the marshal Montmorency, from whose\r\nreligious moderation and popularity much was expected.[462] The capital\r\nof France at this season presented a strange and terrible appearance.\r\nArmed bands roamed the streets. The city more resembled a frontier\r\ncity in a state of siege than a mercantile or university town. The\r\nstudents of the Sorbonne paraded the streets and went armed to mass,\r\nthe authorities being powerless to control them.[463]\r\n\r\nThe condition in the provinces was as bad; only here the odds seem to\r\nhave been in favor of the Protestants. In Guyenne a Huguenot mob sacked\r\na town, committed many outrages, and finally besieged the governor,\r\nBurie, in his house.[464] A worse occurrence was the murder of Fumel,\r\nan eminent lawyer in Languedoc, as an “enemy of the religion.”[465]\r\nThere were riots in Troyes, Orleans, Auxerre, Rouen, Meaux, Vendôme,\r\nBourges, Lyons, Tours, Angers,[466] Bazas.[467] The Huguenots of Sens\r\nerected a church outside the town. Then finding that they outnumbered\r\nthe Catholics they pillaged the treasury of the cathedral and robbed\r\nthe monasteries.[468]\r\n\r\nStill the queen mother persevered, taking her counsel from the\r\nchancellor L’Hôpital, the admiral Coligny, the prince of Condé, and\r\nhis brother, D’Andelot, and adhered to her resolution to permit\r\nthe Huguenots to enjoy freedom of worship. On January 3, 1562, the\r\nchancellor made an earnest plea for religious toleration before the\r\nCourt of Parlement,[469] which was followed by the most decisive\r\naction the government had yet taken, namely the issuance of the famous\r\nedict of toleration of January 17, known as the Edict of January,\r\nwhich was the first that granted exercise of the Reformed religion _in\r\npublic_.[470]\r\n\r\nThis edict was expressly declared to be _provisional_ in its nature,\r\npending the decisions of the Council of Trent, which, by a coincidence,\r\nwas opened on the day following, January 18, 1562, the first formal\r\nsession being set for the second Thursday in Lent.[471] The preamble\r\nrecited that the government’s action was taken in consideration of\r\nthe state of affairs prevailing in the kingdom; that it was not to be\r\nconstrued as approving the new religion; and that it was to remain\r\nin force no longer than the King should order; it deprecated the\r\n“disobedience, obstinacy, and evil intentions of the people” which made\r\neven provisional recognition of Calvinism necessary. Specifically, the\r\nedict provided for the restoration by the Huguenots of all property\r\nunlawfully possessed by them; it forbade them to _erect_ any churches,\r\neither within or without the cities and towns (Art. 1) or to assemble\r\nfor worship within the walls thereof either by day or night, or under\r\narms (Arts. 2, 5). Protestant worship was required to be in the\r\ndaytime, outside the town gates, in the open, or, if under cover, in\r\nbuildings occasionally used, and not formally consecrated as churches.\r\nFor this reason the Reformed ministers preached, some in the fields,\r\nothers in gardens, old houses, and barns, according to their particular\r\ninclinations or convenience. For they were expressly forbidden to build\r\nany chapels, or meddle with the churches, upon any account. Access\r\nto their meetings was always to be permitted to the King’s officers,\r\ni.e., bailiffs, seneschals, provosts, or their lieutenants, but _not_\r\nto officers of judicature (Arts. 3, 6; and supplementary declaration\r\nof interpretation, February 14, 1562). Furthermore, the raising of\r\nmoney among the Huguenots was to be wholly voluntary and not in the\r\nform of assessment or imposition. They were to keep the political\r\nlaws of the Roman church, as to holidays and marriage, in order to\r\navoid litigation and confusion of property rights; and to refrain from\r\nharboring any person who might be accused, prosecuted, or condemned\r\nby the government, under penalty of a fine of 1,000 crowns, to be\r\ndevoted to charity, together with whipping and banishment (Arts. 8,\r\n9, 12). The use of reproachful or vituperative language touching the\r\nfaith or practice of the Catholic church was made a misdemeanor (Art.\r\n10). Finally, all Protestant synods or consistories were required to\r\nbe held by permission of or in presence of the lieutenant-general of\r\nthe province concerned, or his representative, and the statutes of the\r\nchurches were to be communicated to him (Art. 7, and supplementary\r\ndeclaration and interpretation of February 14, 1562).\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent seditions, an edict was sent to the judges of the\r\ntowns, in the name of the King, by which the authorities were ordered\r\nto disarm all Catholics in their towns of every species of weapon and\r\nto make them deposit their arms in the local city hall or other common\r\npoint, where they were to be kept under the guard of the _procureur_\r\nand the _échevins_.[472]\r\n\r\nIt is a question worthy of consideration, whether the preachings\r\nof the Reformed might not have been peaceably maintained after the\r\nEdict of January, the provisional form gradually being modified until\r\ncomplete religious toleration would have been secured, if Spain had not\r\ncontinued to tamper with French politics, and if the persistence of the\r\npolitical Huguenots had not continued to push things to such a point\r\nthat at last the two causes, originally separate, became the obverse\r\nand reverse sides of the same issue and had to stand or fall together.\r\nOn the other hand, had not these concessions of the crown been too long\r\ndelayed? Was the edict “dead from birth,” as Pasquier wrote?[473]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST CIVIL WAR. THE MASSACRE OF VASSY (MARCH 1, 1562). THE SIEGE\r\nOF ROUEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe progress of events had developed so rapidly as to bely the Edict\r\nof January almost as soon as it was passed. The continued absence of\r\nthe Guises from the court made them open to suspicion, particularly\r\nas messengers were passing frequently between Joinville and St.\r\nGermain.[474] The nets of conspiracy woven by the Triumvirate were\r\ndaily being drawn tighter around France. Directed by Chantonnay and the\r\ncardinal of Ferrara (who generally spoke in Spanish when together in\r\npublic, that those near by might not understand),[475] the plans of the\r\nTriumvirate were concerted, the Spanish ambassador looking ahead to the\r\nday when force would supplant diplomacy.[476]\r\n\r\nEver since its formation, as we have seen, the Triumvirate had sought\r\nto win over the king of Navarre. As he was, therefore, sought by both\r\nparties, he was much inflated with a sense of his own importance.\r\nAntoine still lived in hope of compounding with Philip for the\r\nkingdom of Navarre, and to that end still negotiated both with the\r\nVatican and with Spain.[477] But he was getting very tired of the\r\nprocrastination of the Spanish king, so that there was danger of the\r\nthread of his patience being snapped.[478] If war broke out in France\r\nand found him in such a mood, an attempt might possibly be made to\r\noverrun Navarre.[479] In consequence, it became necessary to make a\r\nmore tangible proposition to the Bourbon prince. It took the form of\r\na demand and a promise. The demand was that every Huguenot should\r\nbe banished from court and the Protestant clergy expelled from the\r\ncountry together with the prince of Condé, the Châtillon brothers,\r\nthe chancellor, and Montluc, the bishop of Valence. In return Antoine\r\nwas to receive the “kingdom of Tunis” as a reward. This was the new\r\nprize used by Spain to bait the hook, and gradually Antoine was drawn\r\nover to the side of Spain and the Triumvirate. The amusing feature\r\nof this proffer was not so manifest to the men of that day as to us.\r\nGeographical knowledge, even of the Mediterranean coast, was hazy. The\r\nconstable, for example, thought that Tunis was an island! But Antoine\r\nknew more history and geography than Montmorency; he knew that Tunis\r\nwas a Turkish possession which Charles V had vainly tried to seize, and\r\nhad to be beguiled with visions of oriental splendor and large plans\r\nfor its conquest before he became passive. Pending its acquisition,\r\nPhilip II renewed the offer of Sardinia. Meanwhile Antoine received\r\ninstruction in the Catholic faith from a teacher recommended to him by\r\nthe general of the Jesuits,[480] and quarreled with Jeanne d’Albret\r\nbecause she would not let the future Henry IV be taken to mass, or\r\npermit him to be present at the christening of the infant son of the\r\nSpanish ambassador.[481] By March (1562) it was evident that the king\r\nof Navarre was “never so earnest on the Protestant side as he was now\r\nfurious on the other.”[482]\r\n\r\nBut if the Spanish ambassador used smooth words to the king of\r\nNavarre, his language was quite otherwise toward Catherine de Medici.\r\nIn the name of his sovereign he demanded the banishment of Jeanne\r\nd’Albret from court, the compulsory education of Henry of Navarre\r\nin the Catholic religion, and so soundly rated her for harboring\r\nColigny and D’Andelot at court that the outraged queen mother\r\ndemanded his retirement,[483] ordered the marshal St. André back\r\nto his government,[484] and the constable to retire to Chantilly,\r\nand contemplated doing the same with the old cardinal Tournon. This\r\nprocedure offended Antoine who imputed her conduct to Coligny and his\r\nbrother, and in consequence he inclined more than ever toward the\r\nTriumvirate.[485] Finally on Palm Sunday (March 22) Antoine cast the\r\ndie and went to mass, coming from the service with the emblem of the\r\ncelebration in his hand.[486]\r\n\r\nA superficial aspect of peace still prevailed at court, but in the\r\nprovinces a state of war already prevailed. Sens,[487] Abbeville,[488]\r\nTours, Toulouse, Marseilles, Toul in Lorraine,[489] and most of all\r\nCahors and Agen,[490] where the terrible Montluc figured, were all\r\nscenes of riot and bloodshed during the winter months, in which the\r\nHuguenots were generally worsted.[491] In Agen it was so bad that the\r\ngovernment had to take more than ordinary notice of the situation.\r\nCharles IX called upon the governor of Guyenne to repress “les excès,\r\nforces, violences, sacagements d’églises, séditions et escandalles\r\nadvenus en nôtre pays d’Agenais,” and ordered the consuls of the city\r\nto send him the names of those who disturbed the peace.\r\n\r\nIn this condition of things only a spark was needed to throw the whole\r\ncountry into flames. Force alone could settle the irreconcilable\r\nconflict, and it was soon to be invoked. War was certainly anticipated\r\nby both parties. But contrary to expectation it was not precipitated\r\nby Spanish intervention, but by outbreak within France. It was the\r\nmassacre of Vassy on March 1, 1562, that threw the country into civil\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MASSACRE OF VASSY, MARCH 1, 1652\r\n\r\n(Bib. Nat., Estampes. _Histoire de France_, Q. b.)]\r\n\r\nThe duke of Guise had spent the winter, as we have seen, working\r\nin the interest of the Triumvirate. On February 15, 1562, he had a\r\nconference at Saverne with the duke of Württemberg, whom he adroitly\r\npersuaded into the belief that the Calvinists were aiming to involve\r\nthe German Protestants in their own quarrel, thereby securing his\r\nneutrality in event of civil war. Shortly after his return to France\r\nthe duke left Joinville with the intention of rejoining the court. As\r\nhe was passing through Vassy,[492] his retinue encountered a Huguenot\r\ncongregation worshiping in a barn outside of the town. Though the\r\nservice was strictly in conformity with the Edict of January, the\r\nsight angered the duke, whose followers fell upon the company, and the\r\nfamous massacre ensued. It was March 1, 1562. How much provocation\r\nwas made by the Protestants for this attack is a matter of dispute.\r\nThe duke himself and Catholic partisans ever since have asserted that\r\nstones were first thrown at him. Probably the absolute truth will never\r\nbe known. Ranke, perhaps, sums up the verdict of history best in the\r\nstatement that “whether the duke intended the massacre or not, it is\r\nenough that he did not prevent it.”[493] Two weeks later, on March 16,\r\nthe duke of Guise, accompanied by the chief members of his house, save\r\nthe cardinal of Lorraine and the duke of Elbœuf, arrived in Paris. The\r\ncapital, which long since had learned the news of Vassy, received him\r\njoyfully.[494] At the St. Denis gate he was met by the constable and\r\nhis four stalwart sons, the eldest of whom was governor of the city,\r\nthe four marshals of France, and twenty-one knights of the Order.\r\nHaving arrived at his hotel, the provost of the merchants, who was\r\nsyndic of Paris, accompanied by many of the chief merchants, visited\r\nhim, “testifying his joyful welcome,” which was further attested by\r\nthe proffer of two millions of gold in favor of the Catholic cause.\r\nThe duke made an adroit reply, assuring them that the queen mother and\r\nthe king of Navarre, with the aid and advice of the King’s council,\r\nwould pacify the realm; that he, as a faithful and loyal subject, must\r\nabide where the King commanded, and that he hourly expected a summons\r\nto court. On the same day the prince of Condé, returning from the court\r\nto Paris with the intention of going to Picardy, finding the duke of\r\nGuise in the capital, changed his plans and tarried in Paris, though\r\noffering to leave the town by one gate if the duke, the constable, and\r\nthe marshal St. André would leave by the other.[495] When the Guises\r\nperceived that the Huguenots were undismayed by the events, they began\r\nto increase their adherents in the city, so that in a short time, it\r\nwas thronged with nearly ten thousand horsemen. It was impossible, on\r\nthe other hand, for the Huguenots to concert measures of defense in\r\nParis, and accordingly the prince of Condé soon quitted the capital\r\n(March 23) “like another Pompey,”[496] going to Meaux, where Coligny\r\nand D’Andelot soon joined him.[497]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Catherine de Medici, fearful lest the person of the King\r\nwould be forcibly seized by the Guises, and recognizing that the king\r\nof Navarre had surrendered completely to the Triumvirate, endeavored to\r\nremove the King to Blois. But Antoine hotly protested against so overt\r\na move in favor of the Huguenots and Spain’s ambassador fulminated\r\nso strongly against “the evil reputation” of L’Hôpital,[498] that\r\nthe court was compelled to go to Fontainebleau instead.[499] Even\r\nthis place met with small favor on the part of the Guises, who would\r\nhave preferred keeping the court in Paris. But when they urged the\r\nnecessity of the queen’s presence in the council in consideration of\r\nthe grave state of affairs, Catherine caustically rejoined that she\r\nthought “it more meet to have regard to the health of the King than to\r\ninform so many wise men what was necessary to be done.” This speech\r\nof the queen mother, however, was not said altogether in sarcasm. For\r\ninstead of following the advice of the constable, who showed signs of\r\nresenting the Guise ascendency, that the crown repudiate and condemn\r\nthe massacre of Vassy and announce its determination to maintain the\r\nEdict of January,[500] Catherine in her alarm lest the rising of the\r\nHuguenots sweep the Valois dynasty from the throne began to incline\r\ntoward Spain.[501] For the time being the Triumvirate professed itself\r\nsatisfied, intending after Easter to compel the court to repair to\r\nBois de Vincennes, in order to have the King in their midst and thus\r\nstrengthen with his name the authority of their actions.[502] Great\r\nwas the alarm, therefore, when the prince of Condé, accompanied by\r\nthe admiral Coligny and D’Andelot, appeared before the gates of Paris\r\non March 29 with three thousand horse.[503] Immediately all the\r\nbridges were drawn up and preparations made to meet an attack.[504]\r\nAlready extraordinary arrangements had been made for the defense of\r\nParis. Strangers were compelled to leave the city; no persons except\r\ngentlemen were permitted to wear arms and these were limited to sword\r\nand dagger; only six gates were open and these were under double\r\nguard.[505] Failing to enter the city, the prince quartered his troops\r\nat St. Cloud and took possession of the highroad from Paris to Orleans\r\nat Longjumeau, while in Paris the duke of Guise, the king of Navarre,\r\nand the constable hastened forward the preparations for war.[506]\r\nBut the prince of Condé refrained from the use of force. He gave out\r\nthat he had as much right to enter the city under arms as had Guise,\r\nand complained of the fact that Guise and his following, on March 27,\r\nwhich was Good Friday, had visited the King and Queen at Fontainebleau,\r\nwhere the latter “made them strange countenance because the train\r\ncame in arms to the court.”[507] The apparent purpose of the prince\r\nof Condé was to cut Fontainebleau off from Paris, for the admiral lay\r\nat Montreuil, but four leagues distant, and thus force a reasonable\r\nsettlement, or push matters to an extremity by making himself master\r\nof the Loire, thus cutting France in twain and having all Guyenne and\r\nPoitou and much of Languedoc at his back. Color was lent to this belief\r\nby the fact that so many men from the northern and eastern provinces\r\nwere passing southward that a special body of troops was set to guard\r\nthe line of the Seine.[508]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HUGUENOT MARCH\r\n  TO\r\n  ORLEANS\r\n\r\n  March 29.-April 2. 1562\r\n\r\n  Methuen &. Co.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut the Catholic leaders guessed Condé’s purpose and by a _coup\r\nde main_ seized the King and his mother and carried them off from\r\nFontainebleau to Melun, a town strong enough to be withheld against any\r\nsudden enterprise. Thereupon the prince, perceiving that he had been\r\noutreached, marched toward Orleans[509] in spite of an order sent from\r\nthe King, and undoubtedly inspired by Guise, that he should lay down\r\nhis arms. An attempt to prevent him from reaching Orleans was blocked\r\nby a rapid advance of D’Andelot.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the constable had assumed the direction of affairs in\r\nParis, where on April 5 the Huguenot house of worship near the Port\r\nSt. Antoine was torn down, the pulpit, forms, and choir burned, and\r\nfragments carried away as souvenirs by the mob. Troops patrolled the\r\nstreets, arresting suspects, and a house to house visitation was made\r\nin search of Calvinist preachers. The same day the court came to Bois\r\nde Vincennes. During the next few days vain overtures were made to\r\nthe prince. Coligny and D’Andelot offered to meet the queen mother at\r\nsuch a place as she would appoint, provided the prince of Navarre, the\r\nfuture Henry IV, Damville, the constable’s second son, and one of the\r\nGuises, were given into Orleans as hostages for them. Catherine was\r\nwilling to accept the offer, but was overruled by Antoine of Bourbon,\r\nthe duke of Guise, and Montmorency.[510] Those who were least alarmed\r\nstill looked for settlement at the hands of the General Council. But\r\nthere were serious political difficulties, as well as those religious,\r\nin the way of this, the three principal ones being: (1) the summons of\r\nthe council, which many Catholics even wished to be convoked by the\r\nEmperor, and not by the Pope; (2) the place of the council; (3) the\r\nauthority of the council, which many Catholics wished to be above the\r\nPope.[511]\r\n\r\nOn April 12, 1562, at Orleans, the prince of Condé formally assumed\r\ncommand of the Huguenot forces,[512] his chief lieutenants being the\r\nadmiral Coligny and D’Andelot.[513] The first civil war was a reality.\r\nThe city on the Loire for some years to come was destined to be the\r\ncapital of the Protestants, dominating all the surrounding country.\r\nBlois and its château, Tours and its castle, Amboise, Saumur, Angers,\r\nand many other towns on the Loire and in Maine, were occupied by the\r\nProtestants. Orleans was reputed to have bread and wine enough in\r\nstore to withstand a two years’ siege,[514] and the Huguenots seemed\r\nto have plenty of money for immediate necessities, thanks to their\r\ndespoilment of the churches of the region, especially the rich abbey\r\nof Marmoutier.[515] Although the purposes of the Huguenots were\r\nclandestinely more political than religious, it was expedient to cloak\r\nthem under a mantle of faith.[516] The political organization of the\r\nHuguenots was effected through the medium of an association, a form\r\nof organization of which there are many examples, both Protestant and\r\nCatholic, during this troubled period. The preamble of the instrument\r\nof government disclaimed any private motives or considerations on\r\nthe part of those who were parties to the association, and asserted\r\nthat their sole purpose was to liberate the King from “captivity” and\r\npunish the insolence and tyranny of the disloyal and the enemies of\r\nthe church. Idolatry, blasphemy, violence, and robbery, were forbidden\r\nwithin the territory of the association, in order that all might know\r\nthat it had “the fear of God before it.” The association was to expire\r\nafter the King had attained his majority.[517]\r\n\r\nThe essential difficulties in the situation as it obtained at this\r\ntime are manifest. The Huguenots declared the King to be a captive in\r\nthe hands of the Guises and themselves claimed to be loyal subjects\r\nin rebellion against tyranny.[518] The Guises, on the other hand,\r\nbranded the Huguenots as rebels and schismatics, although Catherine de\r\nMedici still had a lingering hope of restoring peace, and in official\r\nutterances carefully refrained from alluding to the prince of Condé as\r\na rebel.[519] Neither side would agree to lay down its arms without\r\nthe other doing likewise, and neither dared take the initiative in\r\nthis matter. The situation, therefore, was an irreconcilable one,\r\nwhich nothing but war could settle. The political determinations of\r\nthe Huguenots were quite as fixed as their religious convictions, for\r\npart of their platform was the article agreed upon by the estates\r\nat Orleans to the effect that the cardinal of Lorraine, the duke of\r\nGuise, the constable, and the marshals Brissac and St. André, should\r\nrender an account of their stewardship.[520] How far politics governed\r\nthe situation is evidenced by the fact that late in April the king of\r\nNavarre and Montmorency began to weaken in their attitude when it was\r\nknown that Condé dominated the middle Loire country, Touraine, Maine,\r\nAnjou, and much of Normandy; when it was learned that the cities of\r\nLyons,[521] Toulouse, Caen, Rouen,[522] Dieppe, Troyes, Bourges,[523]\r\nand the provinces of Dauphiné, Provence, and Poitou, had declared\r\nfor the Huguenot cause; and when troops were pouring into Orleans by\r\nthousands.[524]\r\n\r\nIf the Guises and the marshals Brissac and St. André could have\r\nacquitted themselves with so little discredit as Antoine of Bourbon\r\nor the constable, it is possible that a compromise might have been\r\nmade even yet.[525] But such an issue was impossible under the\r\ncircumstances. The guilt of Vassy still hung over the duke, for he had\r\nnot yet been absolved either by the Court of Parlement or by the peers\r\nof France. Having appealed to force, force remained the only method\r\nof settling the great dispute that divided France, and Guise daily\r\nassembled horse and foot in Paris in expectation of battle.[526]\r\n\r\nThe formidable nature of the Huguenot rising by this time had so\r\nincreased the fear of Catherine de Medici that she completely\r\nsurrendered to the Triumvirate and resolved to appeal to Spain for\r\nhelp. On April 19 she sent for Antoine of Navarre, the duke of Guise,\r\nthe constable, and the two marshals, Brissac and St. André, to whom\r\nshe declared that she had been badly advised hitherto, and that she\r\nnow trusted to their support. Montmorency at once proposed to ask the\r\nnuncio to petition His Holiness to send money and troops to the help\r\nof Catholic France. But Spain, not Rome, was the political cornerstone\r\nof the Catholic world, and it was now that the momentous resolution\r\nwas taken to invite Philip II to lend assistance. Catherine de Medici,\r\nwho shortly before this time had looked upon the prospect of Spanish\r\nintervention with apprehension, was now in favor of it. At Catherine’s\r\ninstance the Triumvirate formally invited Spain’s support in a joint\r\nletter which was accompanied by Antoine of Navarre’s written profession\r\nof the Catholic faith.[527] Two weeks later, May 8, Charles IX himself\r\nformally solicited military assistance of Philip II.[528] Catholic\r\nSwitzerland,[529] Catholic Germany,[530] Savoy, the Pope,[531] and\r\nother princes of Italy were also looked to.[532] The queen mother\r\ndid not know that already the Triumvirate had anticipated her request\r\nby asking the Spanish King to instruct the regent of Flanders to\r\nhold the troops there in readiness “because Madame de Parma would not\r\nlet a single horse go out of Flanders without orders.”[533] By the\r\nend of June these troops were ready. They were almost all Spaniards\r\nand Italians, then universally regarded as the best soldiers in the\r\nworld.[534] Philip II, though, was actuated by other motives besides\r\nzeal for Catholicism.[535] He feared lest the south of France might\r\nattack Navarre, owing to the identification of Jeanne d’Albret with the\r\nHuguenot cause, and so sent reinforcements to Fontarabia and Pampeluna;\r\na movement which weakened the prince of Condé by preventing Grammont’s\r\nGascon troops from going to Orleans.[536]\r\n\r\nThe war went forward in spite of lack of funds on both sides. In order\r\nto pay the expenses of the war in Brittany Catherine authorized the\r\nseizure of the plate in the churches. But the duke of Etampes, who was\r\ngovernor of Brittany, was cautious about carrying out this order. “The\r\npeople are so religious and scrupulous in these things,” he wrote,\r\n“that if they found out that we wanted to take it, they would not\r\nreadily endure it, especially in Lower Brittany.” Instead he advised\r\nthat the plate of the churches be deposited in some principal town in\r\neach bishopric, “under color of retaining and guarding it there, and\r\nthat a tax of from 15 to 20 livres be imposed upon each person for this\r\npurpose,” figuring that this expedient would produce from 15 to 20,000\r\nlivres.[537] The Huguenots let no money pass from the provinces under\r\ntheir control, even going so far as to destroy the government registers\r\nin the towns they took.[538]\r\n\r\nEvery day increased the interest of the populace in the struggle.[539]\r\n“If the prince of Condé should come to Paris,” wrote an Englishman\r\nin Paris, “they could not tarry there, on account of the fury of\r\nhis soldiers and the populace.”[540] In Dauphiné, De la Mothe\r\nGondrin, lieutenant of the duke of Guise, was slain at Valence by the\r\nProtestants. It is just to say, however, that he was the aggressor.\r\nAccompanied by sixty or eighty gentlemen he went out into the country\r\nand came upon a worshiping company of Calvinists “and left not one\r\nof them alive.” A Huguenot nobleman, Des Adresse who styled himself\r\n“lieutenant of the King in Dauphiné,” acquired a reputation in the\r\nregion as sinister as that of Montluc in Gascony. The whole southeast\r\nof France seemed up in arms.[541] Grenoble, Macon in Burgundy, Châlons\r\nin Champagne, Moulins in Bourbonnais, where they destroyed the tombs\r\nof Antoine’s ancestors,[542] were taken by the Huguenots. Lyons, by\r\nreason of its proximity to Geneva, was radically Huguenot, and this\r\nsentiment was stimulated still more by the great discontent that\r\nprevailed among the lower classes, engaged in silk manufacturing and\r\nother industries.[543] In Normandy it was even worse. At Rouen the\r\nHuguenots routed the Catholics and seized the government.[544] On May\r\n14 Maligny took Havre-de-Grace, which astonished and affrighted the\r\nCatholics because it stood at the mouth of the Seine and made open\r\ncommunication between the Huguenots and the English easy. At Caen,[545]\r\nBayeux, and most places in Lower Normandy, the inhabitants defaced\r\nthe images in the monasteries and parish churches, and arrested the\r\nKing’s revenues coming to Paris.[546] Caudebec, which revolted on May\r\n15, was besieged by the Guisards, but had placed men in it previously\r\nand so saved itself. In Dieppe, where the revolt followed hard upon\r\nnews of Vassy, a conflict between Protestants and Catholics resulted\r\nin the death of 150 persons.[547] Terrible cruelties were committed at\r\nAngers[548] by the Protestants.\r\n\r\nAmid this almost spontaneous insurrection involving provinces widely\r\nseparated from one another, the Ile-de-France and Burgundy adhered to\r\nthe crown and the Catholic cause, the former wholly from inclination,\r\nthe latter in part because of the adroitness of Tavannes, the\r\nbrilliant captain, who foiled the Huguenot assault upon Dijon,[549] and\r\nsaved Châlons-sur-Saône.[550]\r\n\r\nIn spite of these occurrences, however, abortive negotiations for peace\r\nfilled the ten days between the 18th and the 28th of May.[551] In Paris\r\nit was expected that Condé would attack the city. The government’s\r\nforce was not sufficient to take the field, and twenty-five pieces\r\nof artillery were paraded through the streets to make an impression\r\nand to induce the clergy and Parisians to contribute money for this\r\nreligious war-making.[552] Popular opinion in Paris was bitterly\r\nhostile to the Huguenots, but the bourgeois were not inclined to go\r\ndown into their pockets and so, when the cowardly king of Navarre\r\npublished a proclamation on May 26[553] expelling all Protestants from\r\nParis and leaving their goods at the mercy of their adversaries, it\r\nwas hailed with delight by the capital. Mobs of Catholics forcibly\r\nexpelled Huguenots from the city and destroyed their goods. The city\r\nwas so full of men-at-arms, highwaymen, and robbers at this time that\r\nevery householder was required to keep a light in his street window\r\nuntil daybreak.[554] Risings in many parts of the country continued to\r\nbe heard of;[555] Vendôme, La Charité, Auxerre, Montargis, Poitiers,\r\ntogether with most of the towns of Saintonge and Angoumois,[556] either\r\ndeclared for the prince of Condé or were taken by him. But at Toulouse\r\nthe Huguenots suffered heavily.[557] In Normandy, there was great fear\r\nof English intervention.[558]\r\n\r\nOvertures for peace came to nothing because the Huguenots made the\r\nwithdrawal of the Triumvirate a condition precedent to their laying\r\ndown of arms.[559] The prince contended that he could not be secure\r\nunless the duke of Guise, the constable, and the marshal St. André\r\nretired from the court. The queen mother in reply represented that it\r\nwas not right, during the King’s minority, to remove from him such\r\nimportant personages; that the Catholics in Paris had taken up arms to\r\noppose the Edict of January, and that if the Huguenot soldiery would\r\nretire to their homes they might live there as they liked, while a\r\ncouncil (of which he should be a member) considered some better means\r\nof settlement.[560] Gradually the hostile armies—the prince of Condé\r\nat the head of the Huguenots and the duke of Guise, the constable,\r\nthe marshal St. André and the recreant king of Navarre with the\r\nCatholic host—drew near to each other.[561] An attempt was made to\r\ntake Jargeau, eight miles from Orleans; but fearing lest its capture\r\nwould cut supplies off from Orleans, Coligny and D’Andelot destroyed\r\nthe bridge there. This forced the Catholic captains to change their\r\nintention, and they traversed the Beauce so as to surprise Beaugency,\r\nfourteen miles from Orleans, midway between Orleans and Blois, where\r\nthere was a bridge across the river. On June 15 the two forces arrived\r\nnear the bridge at almost the same time and a fight seemed imminent.\r\nThe two armies were about five miles apart, and about the same distance\r\nfrom Orleans. Both being south of the Loire, there was no river to\r\nhinder an engagement. There were many vineyards between them, which\r\nwas an advantage to the prince, who had more infantry than cavalry,\r\nwhile Guise had 7,000 horse, D’Aumale having come from Normandy with\r\nhis force. The Catholic forces were divided: Guise lay north of the\r\nriver, beyond Beaugency, Paris-ward; D’Aumale’s detachment was on\r\nthe other side of the river at Clerie, midway between Orleans and\r\nBeaugency, having the town and the bridge in his hands; while Navarre\r\nwas established at Vernon, a league from Beaugency.[562]\r\n\r\nThe condition of the country around Orleans at this time, considering\r\nthat a state of war existed, was not bad. Condé had plenty of money\r\nfor the moment, having secured the riches of the churches of Bourges.\r\nFood was good and plentiful in Orleans and bread was cheap. Everything\r\nthe Huguenots took they paid for, as a matter of policy,[563] although\r\nlarge funds were not in sight and they looked anxiously to England for\r\n100,000 crowns, offering the notes of the leaders as security or else\r\nthe bonds of some of the most notable Reformed churches, as Rouen and\r\nLyons. The Huguenot army made a brave display. Many of the gentlemen\r\nwere rich and wore long white coats (_casaque blanche_) of serge,\r\nkersey, or stramell, after the old manner, with long sleeves over\r\ntheir armour.[564] The truce expired on June 21 (Sunday), but only\r\nlight skirmishing was indulged in while specious negotiations were\r\ncontinued by Montmorency.[565] But the Catholic leaders offered such\r\nhard conditions that Condé would not accept them. Among others it was\r\ndemanded that all preachers should be banished from France, together\r\nwith the prince himself, the brothers Châtillon, and the other Huguenot\r\nleaders, until the King was of age.\r\n\r\nDuring this delay the prince lost the advantage he had possessed. For\r\nthe duke of Guise, the constable and Marshal St. André returned from\r\nChartres to the camp again, which was between Beaugency and Blois,\r\nwhich lends color to the theory that it was they who overruled Antoine\r\nof Navarre and Catherine. After the rupture of the truce, the Catholic\r\narmy marched to Blois, which they battered for a day and a night,\r\nassaulted and entered, although the inhabitants offered to let them in\r\nat the gates. When the magistrates of the city offered the keys to the\r\nduke of Guise, he pointed to the cannon with him, saying they were the\r\nkeys he would enter by. At the same time St. André took Poitiers and\r\nAngoulême and drove La Rochefoucauld into Saintonge with the aid of\r\nSpanish troops.[566] When informed of the duke’s proceedings at Blois,\r\nCondé marched to Beaugency, which, after bombardment, was entered\r\non July 3, the most part of those who were left to guard it being\r\nkilled.[567] Then seeing his own fortunes diminishing daily, he retired\r\nto Orleans, with scarcely 3,000 horse and 6,000 footmen. The prince\r\nwas in doubt what next to do; whether to retire to Lyons and join\r\nwith the baron des Adresse,[568] who had acquired Grenoble, Valence,\r\nand Châlons in Burgundy, despite Tavannes who kept the field with his\r\nforces,[569] and was reputed to have 8,000 foot and 1,500 horse besides\r\n6,000 Swiss sent from Bern and Lucerne, or to retire to Gascony where\r\nthe queen of Navarre was, or thirdly to go to Rouen and thereby keep\r\nNormandy. In the end, however, he and Coligny stayed in Orleans. The\r\nremainder of his force was either dispersed in the various towns or\r\ndismissed.\r\n\r\nThe Protestants stood in dire need of outside aid during this\r\nsummer.[570] A few days after Condé had retired within Orleans,\r\nD’Aumale took Honfleur (July 21). In Paris mobs killed almost hourly\r\nmen, women, and children, notwithstanding an edict to the contrary\r\nunder pain of death. Arms were in the people’s hands, not only in Paris\r\nbut in the villages. Neither the King nor the queen mother had the\r\nmeans to rule them, for the king of Navarre and the duke of Guise were\r\nthen at Blois, with the result that Paris did much as it pleased. The\r\nleaders contemplated the recovery of Touraine, Anjou, and Maine, and\r\nall the towns upon the Loire, and then proposed to go into Normandy\r\nand recover Havre-de-Grace, Dieppe, and Rouen. In pursuance of this\r\nproject the duke of Guise took Loudon and Chinon in Touraine. In the\r\nsame month Mondidier was entered by the Catholics upon assurance that\r\nall the Protestants therein should live safely; but notwithstanding the\r\npromises they were all cut to pieces, robbed, or driven forth. Numbers\r\nof men, women, and children were drowned in the night with stones\r\nabout their necks, at Blois, Tours, and Amboise, and those towns which\r\nsurrendered to the king of Navarre.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were taking place in the Loire country, the duke\r\nof Aumale again approached Rouen on the 29th of June, and planted his\r\nbatteries before St. Catherine’s Mount, but succeeded in doing little\r\nin spite of his long battery. He hoped to recover Havre-de-Grace after\r\nGuise had seized the towns upon the Loire. The great fear of the French\r\nwas lest Havre-de-Grace should be given by the Huguenots into the hands\r\nof the English, and the atrocious practice of D’Aumale was likely to\r\nfurther such conduct on the part of the Huguenots,[571] for he promised\r\nthe peasantry not only the privilege of sacking the châteaux of the\r\nnobles, but also to relieve them of all taxes. As a result of this\r\nvicious policy, trade was dead and whole families of the nobility\r\nretired to Dieppe, abandoning their homes.[572]\r\n\r\nViolence increased both in the cities and in the provinces. In the\r\nsoutheast Somarive committed great cruelties in Orange, killing men,\r\nwomen, and children wherever he went.[573] But the achievements of\r\nMontluc, “the true creator of the French infantry”[574] were the\r\nconspicuous feature of the war in the south. By his own confession\r\nthis famous soldier “rather inclined to violence than to peace, and\r\nwas more prone to fighting and cutting of throats than to making of\r\nspeeches.”[575] The war in the southern provinces, it is plain, was\r\none of both politics and religion. The practices of the Huguenots\r\npenetrated the whole administrative machinery. The sieur de Burie,\r\nking’s lieutenant in Guyenne, was old and overcautious, and not without\r\nsuspicion of Calvinism,[576] while Duras, the Huguenot leader was so\r\nactive that the crown had sent the veteran of the siege of Sienna into\r\nGuyenne in January, 1560, with a special commission.[577] The Huguenots\r\ntried to buy Montluc off through one of their captains formerly with\r\nhim before Sienna, who came to him saying that the church at Nérac had\r\nmade him their captain. Montluc’s reply nearly took the captain off his\r\nfeet. “What the devil churches are those that make captains?” was his\r\nfierce question.[578] He speedily began to make his name formidable by\r\nhanging six Huguenots without process of law “which shook great fear\r\ninto the whole party.”\r\n\r\nMontluc’s arrival was in the nick of time for the Catholics of the\r\nsouth. He thought that if the Huguenots had been more led by soldiers\r\nand not so “guided by ministers, they had not failed of carrying\r\nBordeaux and Toulouse. But God preserved those two forts, the\r\nbulwarks of Guyenne, to save all the rest.” Montluc was everywhere at\r\nonce, never resting long in any place, holding his foes in suspense\r\neverywhere, and not only was himself in continual motion, but also\r\nwith letters and messages perpetually solicited and employed all the\r\nfriends he had.[579] His troops were few in numbers and so ill-paid\r\nthat he sometimes was reluctantly compelled to ransom his prisoners.\r\n“We were so few that we were not enough to kill them all,” he\r\ncomments. “Had the King paid his companies I should not have suffered\r\nransom to have been in use in this quarrel. It is not in this case as\r\nin a foreign war where men fight for love and honor. In a civil war we\r\nmust either be master or man, being we live as it were, all under a\r\nroof.” He was as good as his word and “shook a great terror into the\r\ncountry everywhere.” When he appeared before Agen he “wondered that the\r\npeople should be so damnably timorous and did not better defend their\r\nreligion.” Instead “they no sooner heard my name but they fancied the\r\nrope already about their necks.” Yet terrible as the old war-dog was,\r\nhe still waged war according to the rules of the game. He is outspoken\r\nin condemnation of the conduct of the Spanish companies sent by Philip\r\nII which joined him before Agen.[580] The importance of Montluc’s\r\nservices in the south was great. He helped save Toulouse and Bordeaux\r\nto the government and the subsequent capture of Lectoure, and the\r\nnotable battle of Vergt in Périgord (October 9, 1562) prevented the\r\nHuguenots south of the Loire from joining the forces of the prince of\r\nCondé, who thus narrowly lost the battle of Dreux.[581]\r\n\r\nAs the Catholic cause mended, the situation of the Huguenots darkened.\r\nFour thousand Swiss in June had joined Tavannes in Burgundy and\r\nthereby Dijon, Macon, and Châlons-sur-Saône were made safe. Late in\r\nJuly 6,000 lansquenets passed through Paris toward the camp at Blois.\r\nPope Pius IV sent his own nephew to the aid of Joyeuse with 2,500\r\nfootmen, one thousand of whom were “Hispainolz.”[582] The Huguenots\r\nimpatiently awaited the coming of German pistoleers and footmen, to be\r\nbrought by Casimir, the second son of the count palatine, accompanied\r\nby D’Andelot who had been sent into Germany for assistance. But the\r\nGerman princes were slow in responding, especially to the demand for\r\nmoney,[583] so that the prince of Condé actually promised to give them\r\nthe pillage of Paris![584] D’Andelot passed the Rhine on September\r\n22, 1562—three weeks too late to relieve Bourges—with 2,000 German\r\nhorse and 2,000 musketeers, who figured in the battle of Dreux in the\r\nnext December.[585] France had seen nothing like these reiters in days\r\nheretofore. Their coming created both consternation[586] and curiosity.\r\nClaude Haton in vain sought the meaning of the word.\r\n\r\n The word reiter had never had vogue in France within the life of the\r\n oldest of men, and one had never used the word until the present,\r\n although the kings of France had been served in all their wars by\r\n Germans, Swiss, and lansquenets, who are included under this word\r\n and name of Germany or Allemaigne. I have taken pains to inquire\r\n of numerous persons, who are deemed to know much what was the\r\n signification of this word “reiter,” but I have not found a man who\r\n has been wise enough to tell me what I wished to know.[587]\r\n\r\nIn order to pay the reiters and to find money, a _taille_ was imposed\r\nupon the Huguenots of all classes, in all towns and villages under\r\ntheir control, upon nobles, priests, merchants, bourgeois, and\r\nartisans. But as this means was very tedious, the prince had recourse\r\nto the gold and silver vessels, chalices, and crosses of the churches\r\nwhich the Huguenots had pillaged. He also seized upon the government\r\nreceipts from the _gabelle_ and other taxes of the King in all the\r\nvillages and _élections_ controlled by the Huguenots, even the moneys\r\nof the royal domain, and the revenues of the churches.[588]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile on August 19 the siege of Bourges had begun. The city was\r\ndefended by about 3,500 soldiers, but the circuit of its walls was\r\nvery great. It was well provisioned for a time, and had considerable\r\nmunitions and artillery of an inferior sort, but neither cannon nor\r\nculverin. Half the town was protected by a great marsh near by; the\r\nother half was fortified. It was the plan of D’Andelot, who had\r\nentered Lorraine with 2,000 horse and 4,000 foot, commanded by the\r\nduke of Deuxponts, feeling he could do nothing in time for Bourges,\r\nto cut off Paris by securing the passages of the river at St. Cloud\r\nand Charenton.[589] Accordingly the constable and the duke of Guise,\r\nlearning of the approach of the reiters, dispatched D’Aumale with a\r\ncommission to levy all men of war in Champagne, Brie, and Burgundy,\r\nboth foot and horse, and to sound the tocsin for the purpose of raising\r\nnew levies for the King if those which he first raised should not\r\nsuffice, and to make a great camp of all these men for the purpose of\r\ncombating the reiters.[590] But D’Aumale dallied so long,[591] to the\r\nintense chagrin of his army, which clamored to “frapper dessus les\r\nlif-lof de reistres,”[592] that the German troopers were able to cross\r\nthe river Seine at Chanceaux, whence they took the road above Auxerre,\r\ncrossed the Yonne, and so joined the prince of Condé at Orleans.\r\n\r\nIt would have been much better for France, and especially for the\r\nprovinces of Champagne, Brie, and Burgundy, if D’Aumale had attempted\r\nto repulse the reiters, for his soldiers were the ruin of the villages\r\nwhere they lodged, and any action, even defeat, would have been better\r\nthan license and idleness. When it was known that the reiters had\r\nevaded the force sent against them, the King, seeing new villages of\r\nFrance taken every day, sent orders to all those who still adhered\r\nto the crown to the effect that they should be on their guard night\r\nand day, for fear of being taken by surprise. For greater security\r\ncommissions were dispatched authorizing the election of a gentleman of\r\nhonor and credit to be town-captain in every town.[593]\r\n\r\nThe Catholic and Huguenot position with reference to each other\r\nbetween Paris and the Loire was now somewhat as follows: the former\r\nheld Chartres, Bonneval, Chateaudun, Blois; the latter St. Marthurin,\r\nMontargis, and Gien. On August 31, 1562, the surrender of Bourges\r\ntook place. The crown guaranteed life, property, and liberty of\r\nconscience to the commandant and soldiers and inhabitants of the town,\r\nin consideration of an indemnity of 50,000 livres “pour avoir été si\r\ngracieusement traités.”[594] But the Catholic leaders were in doubt\r\nwhat next to do, for all the Huguenots were within the towns, neither\r\noccupying the open country nor having a camp outside the walls. The\r\nking of Navarre urged the siege of Orleans, but the council was not in\r\nagreement with him for two reasons: first, on account of the plague\r\nwhich was there; secondly because they had hopes that Navarre might\r\nprevail upon his brother to desert the Huguenot cause, and so spare\r\nthem the exercise of force. For these reasons it was resolved not to\r\npush the siege of Orleans and to attack Rouen instead, where the duke\r\nof Aumale was already.[595]\r\n\r\nThe Guises were now fully aware of the formidable nature of the revolt\r\nof Normandy, there being danger of their also losing western Normandy,\r\nwhere the duke de Bouillon held Caen castle, but was disposed to be\r\nneutral. They planned, therefore, to send the greater portion of their\r\nnew forces, Germans and Swiss, to the aid of D’Aumale, who had advanced\r\nagainst Rouen after D’Andelot gave him the slip, for they were little\r\nneeded in the Loire country. Roggendorf, Guise’s chief German agent,\r\nat this time arrived in Paris with 1,200 German pistoleers, well armed\r\nand mounted; the Swiss captain, Froelich had brought fifteen ensigns of\r\nSwiss, and the Rhinegrave was in Champagne with two regiments of foot\r\nand three hundred pistoleers.[596]\r\n\r\nThe constable and the duke of Guise in fear of English support,\r\nresolved to concentrate the greatest part of their force against Rouen\r\nand Havre-de-Grace. Another motive lay in the fact that Paris was\r\nin want; for the Huguenots recognized that if Rouen, Havre-de-Grace\r\nand Dieppe were well held, coercion of Paris was not impossible. The\r\ncondition at Dieppe and Havre-de-Grace was the source of more anxiety\r\nto the government than any other matter. These towns, owing to their\r\nsituation, were the chief keys to France, without which neither Paris\r\nnor Rouen could be free. Havre-de-Grace was of more use to France than\r\nCalais as a port of supply, and daily all those who escaped from Pont\r\nAudemer, Honfleur, Harfleur, and the Protestants between Dieppe[597]\r\nand Rouen were flocking thither.\r\n\r\nThe chief hope of the French Protestants was based upon the expected\r\naid of England. Early in April, 1562, the prince of Condé and the\r\nadmiral had solicited her support.[598] But the anxiety of Elizabeth\r\nin the welfare of Protestantism beyond sea was not disinterested,\r\nany more than Philip II’s catholicism. The legality of her position\r\nas queen required her adherence to everything anti-Catholic, to\r\nwhich may be added the influence of the political aims of Philip II\r\nwith reference to England, especially his interest in the doings of\r\nMary Stuart and Spanish tyranny in the Low Countries, both of which\r\njeopardized England. Her ambassador in France observed truly when he\r\nwrote her: “It standeth Your Majesty, for the conservation of your\r\nrealm in the good terms it is in, to countenance the Protestants as\r\nmuch as you may.”[599] Another practical end to be gained by English\r\nsupport of the Huguenots was the possibility of recovering Calais.[600]\r\nYet in spite of their deep religious animosity and their political\r\nhostility to one another, England and Spain were in so peculiarly\r\ncomplicated a relation that neither state wished to go to war. Philip\r\nII assured Charles IX that although Elizabeth would squirm at sight\r\nof Spanish assistance given to France, she dared not strike back in\r\naid of the Huguenots, and would have to compel herself to view things\r\nfrom afar.[601] The key to this extraordinary situation is to be found\r\nin the commerce of the Low Countries. The duke of Alva flatly said\r\nthat his master could not afford to break with the English because\r\nof the commercial injury he would sustain in the Netherlands.[602]\r\nThe same proposition, reversed, was in like stead true of England;\r\nher commercial interests in Holland and Flanders were too great to be\r\nrisked.\r\n\r\nBut the good prospect of regaining Calais coupled with the fear lest\r\nthe reduction of France to Spanish suzerainty would entail greater\r\ndanger to England in the long run than the loss of her commerce\r\nbeyond sea, at last persuaded Elizabeth to support the Huguenots,\r\nupon certain conditions, the ultimate one being restoration of Calais\r\nto England.[603] Accordingly, in September, 1562, the queen offered\r\nto land 6,000 men to guard the towns in Normandy, to take Havre and\r\nDieppe under her protection, and receive into them the refugees of the\r\nReformed church, and promised not to abandon Havre without the prince’s\r\nconsent, nor receive Calais from the opposite party. The vidame of\r\nChartres agreed to deliver the custody of Havre-de-Grace to the queen’s\r\nlieutenant on condition that the latter would recompense him and Condé\r\nby annual pensions or assigned lands, because of the loss of their\r\nestates and goods in France. In pursuance of this compact, on September\r\n24, 1562, the English proclamation for the expedition into Normandy\r\nwas published. It was time, if success were to crown the enterprise,\r\nfor in Havre troubles and enemies multiplied and patience with the\r\nEnglish was on the point of breaking. “No prey happens to a sleeping\r\nfox,” wrote the vidame impatiently to the English admiral. On October\r\n1, 1562, the English sailed from Portsmouth for Havre, and on Sunday,\r\nOctober 4, entered the roadstead of Havre at three in the afternoon,\r\nand immediately landed as many men as they could with the tide.\r\n\r\nThe English occupation of Havre-de-Grace startled the government\r\ninto new activity before Rouen, and the King determined to take it\r\nbefore English assistance could be afforded.[604] The town was well\r\nsupplied with provisions and had plenty of small arms, but was short\r\nof artillery and gunpowder. The garrison numbered about 4,000, under\r\ncommand of Montgomery, the guardsman who had accidentally killed Henry\r\nII in tournament, for Morvilliers, the former chief in command in\r\nRouen, had hesitated about the introduction of English soldiers and had\r\nbeen replaced.\r\n\r\nIn the first week of October the attack of the royal forces upon Rouen\r\nwas renewed with fury and the fortress on St. Catherine’s Mount was\r\ntaken by them. Desperation soon prevailed in the beleaguered city and\r\nthere was talk of conditional surrender if that could be effected,\r\nuntil the arrival of a few companies of English revived the courage\r\nof the Rouennais and the fight was renewed. But the procrastinating\r\ncaution of the English by this time overreached itself. In spite\r\nof the importunities of Throckmorton,[605] the English government\r\nwas reluctant to venture its arms beyond the seaboard,[606] although\r\nThrockmorton’s arguments were reinforced by every other English agent\r\nin France, Rouen being represented as “such a jewel for them that by\r\nno means is it sufferable to become an enemy.”[607] All urgency was in\r\nvain. The instructions to the earl of Warwick, the English commander\r\nin Havre-de-Grace, were to the effect that if requested to send aid to\r\nRouen or other places he should make some “reasonable delay,” without\r\noffending them.[608] It is easy to see from such instructions and the\r\npolicy pursued by the English government in France that its interest\r\nwas purely practical and in no sense sentimental or religious. England\r\nwanted to hold Havre-de-Grace in pawn for Calais, under cover of\r\npretending to support the Huguenots.\r\n\r\nBy mid-October, however, it had become plain that this narrow policy\r\ncould not be so rigidly adhered to. The success of the Catholic armies\r\nin Normandy was even endangering Havre-de-Grace, and Havre-de-Grace was\r\nnot nearly so favorable a point of vantage for the English as Calais\r\nhad been, for there the pale protected the city proper; in the city at\r\nthe Seine’s mouth the fortifications were weak and, worst of all, the\r\nlocation was a poor one for defense.[609] With the coming of winter,\r\nit would be possible for the French with slight effort to prevent much\r\nintercourse by sea between Havre and the English ports, while already\r\nthe country roundabout was being devastated by the German reiters.\r\nD’Aumale was reported to have said—and there was justification of the\r\nstatement—that the English garrison might make merry as it pleased,\r\nthe winter and famine would cause them to pack homeward faster than\r\nthey had come. Too late the English at last determined to succor\r\nRouen after the fall of St. Catherine’s Mount,[610] and relief troops\r\nwere sent forward to Rouen from Havre-de-Grace and Dieppe. An intrepid\r\nEnglish captain named Leighton (he was afterward made governor of\r\nGuernsey), with a handful of men, made his way into the city, but\r\nsubstantial assistance did not come until the middle of October. Even\r\nthen misfortune overtook the English. The approach was made by the\r\nriver in six small ships, but one of them struck on a sand bar near\r\nCaudebec and was intercepted by Damville, so that only 600 English got\r\ninto the town.[611]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 16th, Montgomery and two of the chief men of\r\nthe city came out of Rouen, under a flag of truce, and spoke with\r\nthe queen, returning a second time with fresh proposals, but nothing\r\nresulted. The Huguenots demanded, first of all, liberty of preaching,\r\nand of living according to their religion. Besides this, they insisted\r\nthat the King should not put a garrison in Rouen, and as security for\r\nthe observance of these conditions they required hostages from the\r\nKing, to be kept by them at Havre-de-Grace. In the second interview\r\nthey enlarged the conditions; namely, that the Edict of January might\r\nbe observed and that they might preach freely _in the cities_, although\r\nby the edict preaching was permitted only _outside_ of cities.[612]\r\nMoreover, they insisted on this agreement being extended to _all_ towns\r\nof France; and in order to give this convention a general effect, the\r\nprince of Condé was to confirm it. For the observance of all these\r\nconditions they demanded as hostages the prince de Joinville, eldest\r\nson of the duke of Guise, and brother of the marshal Brissac,[613]\r\nsuperintendent of the King’s revenues.\r\n\r\nAlthough Montgomery was unaware of it, the government already, alarmed\r\nby the English intervention, had made overtures to the prince of\r\nCondé in Orleans. But in each case, a condition required would not\r\nbe yielded. The demand of the Rouennais that the Edict of January be\r\nrevised so as to permit Protestant worship _in all towns_ broke off\r\nnegotiations with them. In the overtures made to Condé and Coligny,\r\nrestitution of all in rebellion to their estates and offices was\r\npromised, as also the assurance to the Huguenots that they might enjoy\r\ntheir religion peaceably _in their houses_, but _public_ worship, even\r\nwithout the towns, was not to be permitted. The Protestant leaders seem\r\nto have been inclined to yield to these terms, although they implied a\r\nreduction of their religious privileges, but insisted that the crown\r\nshould assume the payments due to Condé’s German auxiliaries. The\r\ngovernment balked at this proposal, and the prince and the admiral\r\nthemselves balked when the king of Navarre declared that D’Andelot’s\r\nGerman troopers and the Huguenots should unite to expel the English\r\nfrom France, so that in the end neither set of negotiations was\r\nsuccessful.[614]\r\n\r\nDuring the successful assault upon Fort St. Catherine which followed\r\nthe rupture of these negotiations both Antoine of Navarre and the duke\r\nof Guise were wounded, the former by an arquebus-shot in the joint of\r\nthe shoulder, as it proved, mortally, because mortification of the\r\nwound could not be stayed.[615] Montgomery fought furiously in the\r\nassault, which lasted seven hours, and threatened to use his sword\r\nupon any who might seek to yield. It was a desperate and vain battle,\r\nhowever.[616] The King’s forces mined clear to the walls of the town,\r\nand the havoc of their explosions could not be remedied. The breach\r\nin the walls made by both mine and shot was so wide that some of the\r\nroyal force rode through on horseback.[617] On Monday, October 26, the\r\nbesiegers fought their way through and over the walls. In this supreme\r\nmovement the English and the Catholic Germans came sharply together.\r\nNo quarter was given the English in the town, the command being given\r\n“that they should all pass the sword.” Many of them were stripped\r\nnaked by the victors. The wounded English who were found had their\r\nthroats cut; the rest were sent to the galleys. The King entered Rouen\r\nthe day after its capture, making his way over dead bodies which had\r\nbeen spoiled by the soldiers.[618] The royal forces now had unlimited\r\ncontrol of the Seine below Rouen; at Caudebec they staked half the\r\nriver, so that ships and boats were compelled to pass close under their\r\nguns.\r\n\r\nThe Guises now anticipated a swift collapse of the Huguenot cause. All\r\nthe chief towns in France save Orleans[619] and Lyons were either by\r\ninclination or compulsion obedient to the crown, which found powerful\r\nsupport from the property-owning and lawyer class. Politically and\r\nfinancially the government was stronger, although the court was in want\r\nof money at this time. The duke of Guise, the most notable captain and\r\nsoldier in France, the constable and veteran marshals like Brissac\r\nand St. André, had made a combination too strong to be overcome. In\r\nthis strait, the Huguenot leaders grasped at the last straw—the\r\nhope that the prince of Condé might succeed the king of Navarre as\r\nlieutenant of the realm by winning the support of liberal Catholics\r\nand the anti-Guisard element.[620] There was ground for this hope if\r\nthe Calvinists could be persuaded to be a little less radical, and if\r\nthe Catholic religion would be suffered without criticism to be and\r\nremain the religion of France, and the Huguenots would make no further\r\nalteration in their form of worship than the English Reformation had\r\ndone.[621]\r\n\r\nAntoine of Bourbon, since sustaining the wound received at Rouen, had\r\nbeen gradually sinking, and died on board a boat on his way to Paris,\r\nOctober 26, after prolonged suffering.[622] Condé now, by virtue of\r\nthe arrangement made at the meeting of the States-General at Orleans,\r\nlegally succeeded to his brother’s office as lieutenant of the realm,\r\nand proceeded forthwith to send out commissions to the constable,\r\nmarshals, and to all the governors of provinces and places, to repair\r\nto him as the King’s lieutenant-general and governor of France. But in\r\nspite of the regulation of the estates, the court and Catholic party,\r\nby the advice of the cardinals of Ferrara, Lorraine, and Guise, the\r\nduke of Guise, the constable, and marshal St. André, with the special\r\nsolicitation of the Spanish ambassador who voiced his master’s wishes\r\nwith “a lusty swelling tongue,” resolved to establish the cardinal of\r\nBourbon in the authority the king of Navarre had held.[623]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST CIVIL WAR (_Continued_). THE BATTLE OF DREUX (DECEMBER 19,\r\n1562). THE PEACE OF AMBOISE (MARCH 19, 1563)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Rouen, the chief military design of the Guises seems\r\nto have been to protract the war, without giving battle, until the\r\nGermans with D’Andelot and Condé either deserted for lack of pay or\r\nwere corrupted by them. Catherine’s wish, on the other hand, was to end\r\nthe war by composition and not by the sword, fearing to have either\r\nparty become flushed with success. In pursuance of this policy numbers\r\nof the soldiers were permitted to go home, the war being considered to\r\nbe practically at an end until the spring, except that garrisons of\r\nhorse and foot were kept in the towns round about Orleans after the\r\nmanner of a flying siege (_siège volante_). But the rapid advance of\r\nthe prince toward Paris from Orleans, where he had been waiting for\r\nD’Andelot, who mustered his German horse in Lorraine in the middle of\r\nSeptember, after he learned of his brother’s death, required the duke\r\nof Guise to change his plans. Passing by Etampes, which the Guises\r\nabandoned at his approach,[624] the prince of Condé marched toward\r\nCorbeil in order to win the passage of the Seine, where 4,000 footmen\r\nand 2,000 horse of the enemy lay in order to keep the Marne and the\r\nSeine open above Paris for provisioning the capital. The Huguenot army\r\nnumbered about 6,000 footmen; 4,000 of them Germans, and nearly 3,000\r\nhorsemen. Most of the Germans were well armed and mounted, and all\r\n“very Almain soldiers, who spoil all things where they go.”[625]\r\n\r\nThe duke of Guise, having received word of the approach of the\r\nHuguenots upon Paris, abandoned his purpose of going to Havre, in\r\norder to return to the succor of the city. Great difficulty was\r\nexperienced in accomplishing the return of the army, because it was\r\nthe depth of winter and the days were short and the roads heavy.\r\n“Nevertheless everyone in camp took courage, because he was returning\r\nto the good French wines and no more needed to drink the cider of\r\nNormandy.”[626]\r\n\r\nTo combat the Protestant force, Guise and the constable had not\r\nover 6,000 footmen and 1,000 horsemen at Paris, though this force\r\ncould be somewhat enlarged by drawing in the troops around Rouen\r\nand before Havre-de-Grace. It was fully expected that the prince of\r\nCondé would march upon the capital or else take the straight road\r\nto Normandy in order to unite with the English and with their help\r\nattempt to regain possession of Rouen and Dieppe. Paris was in the\r\ngreatest alarm. All the people living in the faubourgs were compelled\r\nto abandon their houses. The state of the royal army was bad; the\r\nsoldiers were scattered and disorganized, for the spoil of Rouen had\r\ninduced every kind of license and debauchery. Moreover, the plague\r\nwas raging everywhere. In this exigency the duke of Guise abandoned\r\nthe country roundabout, within two or three leagues of Paris, to the\r\npillage of the Protestants, withdrew his scattered forces within the\r\nwalls, and feverishly employed every available person in the erection\r\nof fortifications, principally upon the side toward Orleans, for which\r\ncertain unfinished erections of Francis I were utilized. The city\r\nwas so crowded with people even before the appearance of the troops\r\nof the prince that it seemed to be in a state of siege. If Condé at\r\nthis time could have seized the river above and below the capital by\r\nwhich provisions were received into Paris, the city could have been\r\nspeedily reduced to famine, as there was even at this time a scarcity\r\nof food.[627]\r\n\r\nBut Louis of Condé was not a man of good judgment and, while\r\npersonally brave, he lacked political daring. To gain time for the\r\narrival of reinforcements, Catherine and the Guises wheedled him with\r\nempty overtures for peace and sent the marshal Brissac’s brother to\r\nthe Protestant camp near Etampes to propose a plausible settlement,\r\nsaying that the Huguenots might have what they desired if they would\r\naid in expelling the Germans, and especially the English. The last\r\npossibility was what the English agents in France had most feared, the\r\nmore because of the undeniable strength of the Catholic crown party,\r\nwhich had won to itself a great number of the nobility, and because\r\nof the approaching winter, the lack of money among the Huguenots, the\r\nscarcity of food, and the weariness of the country. Such abandonment\r\nof the English by the prince of Condé could hardly have been construed\r\nas a breach of faith, seeing the apathy of the English participation\r\nafter the seizure of Havre-de-Grace and Elizabeth’s slowness in sending\r\nhim financial assistance. But the prince refused to treat with an\r\nagent and continued his march toward Paris. On November 25 his cavalry\r\nappeared in sight of the city and the queen mother and the constable\r\nwent out to parley further. The prince of Condé demanded the post of\r\nlieutenant-general of the realm; for the Huguenots the right to have\r\nchurches in all towns except Paris and its _banlieue_ and frontier\r\ntowns; the right of all gentlemen to have private worship in their own\r\nhouses, and the retirement of the foreign troops. To these demands,\r\nthe queen replied that no one should have her authority, adding that\r\nthe government was already well made up of gentlemen, officers, and\r\nministers, among whom the responsibilities of state had been divided,\r\nso that the government was capable of being well conducted until the\r\nKing had attained his majority. As to toleration, she declared that to\r\ngrant it would only be to encourage civil war.[628]\r\n\r\nToo late Condé found that he had been trifled with[629] in order to\r\ngive the government time to bring up reinforcements[630] and that the\r\nterms he offered had not even been considered. The blame for this\r\nunfortunate turn in the war must rest, not upon the queen mother,\r\nbut upon the Guises. For the duke of Guise and his brother, with the\r\nconstable, could not but fear, that in the event of peace they would\r\nbe ruined, and the duke used his own popularity with the masses and\r\nthe enmity felt by the Parisians toward the queen to gain his ends.\r\nWhen duplicity failed, then Catherine’s adversaries used intimidation,\r\nand the Spanish ambassador at their instigation was sent to her,\r\n“either threatening or protesting, or promising and offering aid,\r\nand thus upsetting everything.”[631] When Paris was full of soldiers\r\nnegotiations were broken off, the prince of Condé declaring defiantly\r\nthat the Huguenots would sharpen their swords as they would have need\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nThe only advantage the prince had gained was that he had been able\r\nto draw his force close in toward Paris, so that in the last week in\r\nNovember he was camped near the Pont de Charenton. On the 26th he\r\nplanted his camp on the left bank, a mile from the faubourgs. If the\r\nprince of Condé had attacked Paris at once, instead of wasting time\r\nat Corbeil in vain _pourparlers_, the whole Huguenot cause might have\r\ntriumphed, for the government would have been forced to yield almost\r\neverything. He might have won the suburbs with little loss, although\r\nin want of heavy artillery, and the city could not then have held out\r\nlong. But now the case was such that he either had to fight—with small\r\nhope of winning, let alone of taking Paris—or else come to an accord\r\nupon his enemy’s terms.[632]\r\n\r\nThe prevailing opinion was that the prince would not be able to keep\r\nhis army together for want of provisions and money, especially in\r\nmid-winter.[633] This proved to be true. On December 9 he broke camp\r\nand marched off crestfallen, toward Normandy, after burning the camp,\r\nto effect a juncture with the English.[634] By this time he had barely\r\n7,000 men, the time of the year telling hard upon the army, for it\r\nwas compelled to live in the open, while his adversaries had 15,000\r\nor 16,000 men of all nations, one-quarter of whom were mounted. The\r\ndifficulty of his position was the greater because he was on the left\r\nbank of the Seine, with no prospect of passing the river, for the duke\r\nof Guise lay at Poissy,[635] while the Rhinegrave and Villebonne were\r\nguarding Pont de l’Arche lower down. Warwick was unwilling to venture\r\nforth from Havre to the prince’s assistance, but hoped, by stopping\r\nthe shipment of salt and other merchandise up the Seine, to be able\r\nto compel the towns of Normandy, as Honfleur, Harfleur, Caudebec, and\r\nRouen, for necessity’s sake to come to terms.[636] Being unable to pass\r\nthe Seine, Condé drew off toward Chartres, followed at the distance of\r\nabout five leagues by the duke of Guise and the constable, and came to\r\na halt near Montfort not far from Evreux, while Guise lay at a point\r\nabout ten leagues west of St. Denis, from whence, including Paris,\r\nhe drew his supplies.[637] All around the two armies the country was\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF DREUX, DECEMBER 19, 1562\r\n\r\n(Bib. Nat., Estampes, _Histoire de France_, Q. b)]\r\n\r\nThe prince’s inability to secure provisions, combined with the failure\r\nof English support, finally compelled him to give battle to the duke of\r\nGuise near Dreux on December 19, the engagement being precipitated by\r\nhis attempt to force the passage of the Eure, although the odds were\r\nagainst him in every particular, for the duke of Guise was posted at\r\na point so chosen that he could fall back on Dreux if compelled to do\r\nso; his flank was protected by a stream and a wood; and his artillery\r\nwas more numerous than that of Condé.[638] The advance guard of the\r\nHuguenots was commanded by the admiral; the “battle,” in which were the\r\nGerman reiters, by D’Andelot; the rear guard by the prince of Condé\r\nhimself. The Huguenot ministers and preachers, armed and mounted,\r\nmoved about among the men, who sang their psalms in such a loud voice\r\nthat the camp of the King could easily hear them. On the Catholic side\r\nthe marshal St. André was pitted against D’Andelot; the constable\r\nMontmorency commanded the rear guard, with instructions to hold off\r\nuntil the Huguenot rear guard entered the fight; while the duke of\r\nGuise himself commanded the advance guard against the admiral.[639]\r\n\r\nThe battle was begun about noon by a victorious charge of the Huguenot\r\nhorse, headed by Condé and Coligny, which drove back the Catholic Swiss\r\nand resulted in the capture of six pieces of cannon and the constable\r\nMontmorency who was slightly wounded in the mouth. His captors “sent\r\nhim to Orleans with such speed, that he drank but once by the way and\r\nthat on horseback.”[640] The second charge was less effective owing\r\nchiefly to the slowness of the prince’s German reiters who had to have\r\ntheir orders interpreted to them, and partly to the effective artillery\r\nfire of the enemy, and culminated in the capture of Condé, whose horse\r\nwas shot under him. Too late to save the prince of Condé the admiral\r\nmade a partial rally of the French and German cavalry, in the course of\r\nwhose attack the marshal St. André was killed.[641] Even then the issue\r\nmight have been different if the Huguenot footmen had not behaved like\r\ncowards.[642] The Protestant loss included about 800 of the noblesse,\r\nand nearly 6,000 footmen and reiters according to those who buried the\r\ndead.[643] The Catholic loss was about 2,000, the most conspicuous\r\namong the fallen being the marshal St. André and Montbrun, the youngest\r\nson of the constable Montmorency.[644]\r\n\r\nThe battle of Dreux was fought on the day of the feast of St.\r\nThomas—almost the shortest day of the year—and the Huguenots had to\r\nthank the oncoming of darkness for saving them from pursuit. Under its\r\ncover Coligny drew off toward Auneau where he pitched camp, but some\r\nof the Huguenot horse galloped all night toward Orleans. Fortunate was\r\nthe Calvinist who could find a cross to put upon his clothing on the\r\nmorrow.[645] Twenty-two standards of the prince of Condé were found\r\nupon the ground, which were sent to the King and hung in the cathedral\r\nof Notre Dame. Almost all Condé’s German footmen were taken prisoners,\r\nabout 2,000, three-quarters of whom were sent back to Germany on\r\nparole, without weapons, and bearing white rods in witness of their\r\nabdication; the rest entered the service of the King and were joined\r\nwith the Rhinegrave’s forces under command of Bassompierre, an Alsatian\r\nin the service of Charles IX.[646]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CAMPAIGN OF DREUX\r\n  NOV.-DEC.  1562\r\n\r\n  _Methuen & Co._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF DREUX according to COMMANDANT de COYNART\r\n\r\n  _Methuen & Co._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe battle of Dreux, while not a complete rout of the Huguenots, was\r\nno less a disaster, because it foiled the efforts of Coligny to effect\r\na junction with the English in Havre and compelled him to fall back\r\non Orleans. Even Spain breathed easier, for anxiety lest the English\r\nget Calais was dispelled.[647] Moreover, the French Protestants were\r\nin need of money, both Coligny’s and D’Andelot’s troops being in\r\narrears of pay, the latter’s reiters having gone three months without\r\nwages.[648] On the other hand the government was in better financial\r\ncondition through the efforts of the cardinal of Lorraine, who\r\ncollected some money at the Council of Trent[649] in order to continue\r\nthe war, and the active efficiency of the Spanish ambassador and the\r\npapal legate, who were excellent coworkers.[650] Yet, in spite of\r\ndefeat, Coligny was resolved to continue the fight, though uncertain\r\nwhat policy to follow. At first he was inclined to go into Dauphiné and\r\njoin forces with Des Adresse against the duke of Nemours,[651] but the\r\nprospect of Catholic relief from Germany in the early spring made it\r\nadvisable to abandon this plan.\r\n\r\nThe military situation was much as follows in mid-January, 1563: the\r\nHuguenot center was at Orleans, where D’Andelot lay, in control of the\r\nmiddle line of the Loire above Blois and as far northward as Chateaudun\r\nand the vicinity of Chartres;[652] Coligny lay at Villefranche\r\n(January 12); Montgomery was in Dieppe and the English in Havre. But\r\ncommunication between the Protestant coreligionists was prevented by\r\nthe way in which the Catholic troops were disposed. Etampes, which the\r\nduke of Guise recovered in January, restored the necessary connecting\r\nlink between Blois and Paris, and the whole line of the Seine was in\r\nthe hands of the Catholics; Warwick was being besieged in Havre by\r\nVieilleville (he had succeeded the Marshal St. André and was also\r\ngovernor of Normandy), who lay at Caudebec.[653] The marshal Brissac\r\nwas at Rouen with seventeen ensigns. The marshal Bourdillon who had\r\nbeen given the bâton of the late marshal Termes was in Piedmont. Paris\r\nof course was in the government’s hands. In Berry where the upper\r\nwaters of the Loire and the Seine flow close together the lines of the\r\ntwo hostile parties came in contact. The admiral in the second week in\r\nJanuary, 1563, passed the Loire at Beaugency and distributed his men\r\nat St. Aignan, Celles, and Montrichard, which lay on the right bank\r\nof the stream.[654] At the same time Guise had been minded to cross\r\nthe river the other way and attack Orleans. This move on the part of\r\neach commander brought about a collision of forces near Cléry, in\r\nwhich Guise was repulsed. The condition of the country at the time\r\nwas terrible, especially for the duke, whose troopers were so pressed\r\nthat they had to forage twelve leagues from camp.[655] Everywhere the\r\nreiters were held in terror, for these raiders frequently made long\r\nand rapid marches and fell suddenly upon places, carrying death and\r\ndestruction with them.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the constable had been kept in light captivity at\r\nOrleans,[656] a treatment in contrast with that experienced by Condé,\r\nwho was first kept under strong guard by Damville in the little abbey\r\nof St. Pierre at Chartres, both the windows and the street being\r\nbarred, and later, on January 24, 1563, brought to Paris.[657] Ever\r\nsince Dreux, the queen mother and the constable had been constantly\r\nemployed in the endeavor to make a settlement.[658] In the case of\r\nthe constable, self-interest was the chief motive: he chafed under\r\nconfinement and was envious of the duke of Guise.[659] On the other\r\nhand, Catherine’s anxiety was of a political nature. She was fearful\r\nlest England permanently acquire Havre-de-Grace. Her purpose was to\r\nmake peace with the Huguenots and then unite the parties in a war for\r\nthe recovery of Havre.[660] But the mistrust of the Huguenots that the\r\novertures of peace were meant to be an accord in appearance only; the\r\nambition of the Guises who saw their power thrive in the struggle; the\r\nopposition of Paris, and perhaps above all, the opposition of Spain,\r\nwere difficulties in the way.[661] Philip II’s joy over Dreux was\r\ntempered by his anxiety, and he secretly aimed to thwart any terms of\r\npeace at all favorable to the Protestants.[662] Catherine probably\r\nwould have preferred to abide by anything rather than have the Guises\r\ngain greater profit.[663] The queen mother urged the necessity of\r\npeace on account of lack of funds to carry on the war.[664] But her\r\narguments were cast to the winds by the triumphant Guises when money\r\nbegan to pour into France from Spain, Venice, the duke of Tuscany, and\r\nfrom some of the Catholic German princes.[665]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the penury of the Protestants increased from day\r\nto day. Coligny was in daily fear lest the reiters would desert\r\nhim on account of the delay in paying them.[666] In vain he wrote\r\nto Elizabeth, urging the speedy remittance of money. The cautious\r\nprocrastination and niggardly policy of Elizabeth in the end was\r\nfatal to his purpose. In vain her ambassador in France, the faithful\r\nThrockmorton, urged immediate and liberal action. Warwick also added\r\nhis plea, informing the home government and the queen that the admiral\r\nwould be “ruined and unable to hold up his head without her aid in men\r\nand money.”[667] Elizabeth’s notorious parsimony led her to deceive\r\nthe French Protestants with vague promises, a policy so short-sighted\r\nthat it ultimately lost England the support of the Huguenots and\r\ncompelled the evacuation of Havre-de-Grace, which otherwise they might\r\nhave made another Calais. By February the admiral’s patience was\r\nwell-nigh exhausted, and his troops in mutiny, the reiters raiding the\r\ncountry to such an extent that the court and the foreign ambassadors\r\nwere compelled to retire from Chartres to Blois, not daring to try\r\nto go to Paris. As his position became more desperate from want of\r\nfunds, Coligny determined to strike northward, if possible to effect a\r\njuncture with the English on the coast of Normandy, and so while his\r\nagents parleyed for peace in order to gain time and deceive the enemy,\r\nthe admiral, leaving his wagons and baggage behind him in order that\r\nhis reiters might ride unimpeded, stole away from Jargau on the night\r\nof February 1 with 2,000 reiters, 1,000 mounted arquebusiers, and 500\r\ngentry. His purpose was to join Warwick, but when he reached Dreux,\r\nwhere the battle had been fought six weeks earlier, he discovered that\r\nit was impossible for him to cross the Seine, and hence, after sending\r\nword to the earl that he was in hard straits for money to pay his men\r\nand had “much ado to keep them together,” he drew off toward Caen.[668]\r\n\r\nWhile Coligny lay at Dives, Throckmorton—it must have been against\r\nhis own convictions—was sent to confer with him, informing him that\r\nif the admiral counted that the payment of his army and the support of\r\nthe war depended upon Elizabeth alone, he was to understand that the\r\npeople of England would not willingly contribute to such an expense,\r\nsince the war was of little profit to them. Therefore Elizabeth advised\r\nthe Huguenots not to refuse reasonable conditions of peace, the English\r\nqueen including in the sphere of “reasonable conditions” Huguenot\r\ninsistence that Calais be restored to England.[669]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, while Coligny’s position was growing worse and\r\nworse, the position of D’Andelot in Orleans had also become serious.\r\nThe duke of Guise invested the city on February 4, and got possession\r\nof Portereau (February 6), a faubourg of Orleans across the river,\r\nwhich had been fortified during the previous summer. But the Huguenots\r\nstill held the town at their end of the bridge and broke several of\r\nthe arches down. A tiny island lay in the stream and this the duke\r\nplanned to reach by filling thousands of sacks with sand and gravel\r\nand throwing them into the river between the banks at Portereau and\r\nthe island from whence he would be more able to attack Orleans with\r\ncannon.[670] But it being winter time, the river was too deep and the\r\ncurrent too strong. Failing this, he planned to cut the river above\r\nOrleans in order to let the water into the meadow lands.[671] The\r\nspirited siege lasted many days. Every kind of metal was impressed into\r\nservice by those of Orleans, including shells made of brass, “which was\r\na new device and very terrible,” and their ammunition seemed likely to\r\noutlast that of their enemy. The Catholic position around Orleans was\r\nby no means an enviable one. Food, money, and ammunition were lacking.\r\nAll Guise’s men-at-arms and light horsemen lived at discretion—that\r\nis, they quartered themselves on the surrounding villages and forced\r\nthe poor people of the country to feed them and their horses. The\r\ncourt was doing the same at Blois to the “marvellous destruction” of\r\nthe country. The lack of powder bade fair to be fatal to the duke’s\r\nsuccess, for the government’s powder factories at Chartres, Chateaudun,\r\nand Paris were all blown up, accidentally or otherwise, about this\r\ntime, that of Paris having occurred on January 28, 1563, with great\r\ndestruction of property and some lives.[672] In consequence of these\r\ndisasters, the Catholic artillery had to send all the way to Flanders\r\nfor gunpowder. Although some breaches were made in the wall by the\r\nCatholics, the duke of Guise delayed final assault, for two reasons:\r\nfirst, because the queen mother hoped to take the city by composition,\r\nsecondly, because Catholic reinforcements were looked for late in March\r\nout of Germany, Switzerland, and Gascony, to the number of ten thousand.\r\n\r\nNo such silver lining lightened the cloud on the Huguenot horizon.\r\nD’Andelot from Orleans, the princess of Condé, Eleanor de Roye, from\r\nStrasburg, her imprisoned husband, and Coligny all implored the English\r\nqueen in vain for speedy relief. The admiral’s position by the end\r\nof February was desperate. He had been compelled to move into the\r\nwestern part of Normandy, for his 5,000 reiters were “in such rage\r\nfor their money that he could scarce keep them together,” and were\r\nbeing so corrupted by the enemy that he might otherwise have lost\r\nthem utterly.[673] Powder also was wanting.[674] The condition of\r\nMontgomery[675] in Dieppe and of Warwick in Havre was quite as bad.\r\nIn Havre food was so scarce that rations were reduced to a two-penny\r\nloaf to four persons; wood was unprocurable; the water was bad.[676]\r\nThe spoiling of Normandy from the devastation of Coligny’s reiters who\r\nwere levying upon the country without law or order, and burning and\r\ndestroying villages without regard to religion, was terrible. “If\r\nthe reiters understand that another messenger has arrived here (Caen)\r\nfrom the queen and the money not come,” wrote the admiral, “it will be\r\nimpossible to save our throats from being cut.” Fortunately the very\r\nnext day the English ambassador arrived in Caen with word for Coligny\r\nto the effect that eight thousand pounds in English sovereigns, French\r\ncrowns, angels, and pistolets were on the way from Portsmouth to\r\nCaen.[677] Fire opened on Caen castle on March 1, and the next day the\r\nmarquis D’Elbœuf surrendered it. Bayeux also capitulated.[678] The fall\r\nof these two places and the fearful state of the country,[679] might\r\nhave broken the resolution of the crown to continue the war.[680] But\r\nanother fate intervened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASSASSINATION OF THE DUKE OF GUISE, FEBRUARY 18, 1563\r\n(Tortorel and Perissin)]\r\n\r\nHenry of Guise was mortally wounded on the night of February 18, 1563,\r\nby a Huguenot assassin named Poltrot[681] and died on Ash Wednesday\r\nfollowing, February 24. The death of the duke of Guise was a heavy blow\r\nto the Catholics. His following, because of his personal magnetism,\r\nwas greater than that of any other Catholic leader, for many noblemen\r\nand gentlemen adhered to the Catholic cause more for love of him than\r\nfor loyalty to the established religion. Moreover, he was an able\r\ngeneral uniting quickness of intelligence, determination, experience,\r\npopularity, and physical endurance in his talented person. Immediately\r\nafter Guise was hurt, the queen mother went to the camp with the\r\ndesire to see the constable. The prince of Condé and the constable\r\nwere obviously the men of the hour, and as they could not conduct\r\nnegotiations while they were prisoners, they were both liberated on\r\nMarch 8, and held a conference together on that day.[682] On March 19\r\nthe King, with the assent of his council, formally decreed religious\r\ntoleration and appointed the prince of Condé lieutenant-general of the\r\nrealm with exemption for seizure of any of the royal revenues by him\r\nduring the troubles.[683] It was high time for peace to be made, for\r\nthe revolt of the provinces was increasing. In La Rochelle, Poitou,\r\nGuyenne, and Picardy the “Howegenosys” had again rebelled in February,\r\nand the lieutenants of these provinces sent to Blois for aid.[684]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERVIEW ON THE ILE-AUX-BŒUFS\r\n\r\n(Bib. Nat., Estampes, _Histoire de France_, Q. b)]\r\n\r\nThe terms of Amboise are interesting because they mark the triumph of\r\nthe aristocratic element in the Huguenot party, whose interests were\r\nidentified with their political purposes and their feudal position,\r\nover the “Geneva party,” who were austere Calvinists, and who had an\r\neye single to religion only.[685] D’Andelot, and to a less degree the\r\nadmiral, were representatives of this latter group.[686] The terms of\r\npeace provided that the prince of Condé was to succeed to the place\r\nof the late king of Navarre; that the Huguenot army was to be paid\r\nby the government; that in all towns where the Reformed religion\r\nprevailed, save Paris, it was to be protected; that in every bailiwick\r\nthe King was to appoint one town where the gospel might be preached;\r\nthat all gentlemen holding fiefs in low or mean justice might have\r\npreaching in their houses for the benefit of their families; that all\r\nnobles enjoying high justice might have preaching on their estates;\r\nthat property confiscated from either church was to be restored.[687]\r\nParis firmly refused at first to tolerate any terms of peace,[688] its\r\nCatholic prejudices being aggravated by desire to revenge the murder of\r\nthe duke of Guise; but the King replied to the demur of the Parlement\r\nthat the city must make up its mind to accept the conditions.[689]\r\nOn the other hand, Lyons as obstinately refused to receive the mass,\r\nso that the country round about it remained turbulent well into the\r\nautumn.[690] Rouen, Dijon, Toulouse, encouraged by the opposition of\r\nthe Parlement, refused to recognize the edict.[691] The roads were\r\nfilled with robbers, and the continued presence of the reiters, to whom\r\nan enormous sum in wages was due, was a perpetual menace.\r\n\r\nThe Germans who had been in the service of the King and those of the\r\nprince of Condé fraternized on the road home. They made a great troop\r\nto the number of 10,000 or 12,000, taking the road from Orleans by way\r\nof Pluvières and Etampes to Paris, and arrived there in Easter week,\r\nwhere they stayed for five weeks at least. When they left they were an\r\nentire day crossing the bridge over the Seine, because of the enormous\r\namount of baggage which they had. After having crossed the Seine, the\r\nreiters divided into two bands for better living, one of them skirting\r\nthe right bank of the Seine, the other crossing Brie to the Marne,\r\nin order to find better provisions for themselves and their horses.\r\nThese latter traversed Champagne to the River Aube and encamped at\r\nMontier-en-Der near Vassy for six entire weeks, marauding the country\r\nfor five or six leagues about. Their depredations drove the peasantry\r\nto such despair that protective associations composed of the peasantry\r\nand nobles were formed to resist their aggressions, and these fell upon\r\nstragglers whenever they found a little group of them, and cut their\r\nthroats. Gradually, however, these despoilers were drawn off out of the\r\nland, being accompanied to the frontier by the French infantry under\r\nthe command of the prince de Porcien, who was then at Metz, where he\r\nhad been stationed to foil any effort the Emperor might make for its\r\nrecovery.[692] The priest-historian of Provins has graphically depicted\r\nthe depredations of the reiters:\r\n\r\n At the beginning of this war [he says] the people of the villages\r\n were so rich and well provided for, so well furnished in their houses\r\n with all kinds of furniture, so well provided with poultry and\r\n animals, that it was noble to see.... But the soldiers destroyed their\r\n beautiful tables, their shining brass-bound chests, and killed a great\r\n quantity of poultry without paying for it, or else offering a paltry\r\n sum in proportion to the number of soldiers who were lodged in the\r\n house. It was all one whether one man or many were so lodged, because\r\n the soldier who had a house to himself seized everything to his own\r\n profit. The wives and daughters of the peasantry were compelled to\r\n defend their honor. Property was seized and every sort of villainy was\r\n done by the soldiers, within the space of the three or four days that\r\n they might remain at a place.[693]\r\n\r\nNot since the Hundred Years’ War had France beheld a people more\r\nfearful and formidable than were these reiters. They plundered the\r\nwretched people of all their goods, loading their horses and wagons\r\ntherewith. Amid their equipment they carried winnowing fans to winnow\r\nthe grain, flails to beat it in the granges, and sacks to bind it up\r\nin. They had with them mills to grind the grain and little ovens to\r\nbake bread in. Wherever they lodged they tore up floors, broke into\r\nclosets, and ransacked gardens, courts, and chimneys, in order to find\r\nbooty. They even fell upon the houses and châteaux of the nobles, where\r\nthey passed, if they saw they were not strong or well defended.[694]\r\nFor this reason those living in poorly fortified houses vacated them\r\nand fled to the towns. Those who owned strong and well-fortified houses\r\nlevied soldiers for their defense. What happened at Provins happened,\r\ndoubtless, in many other places, too.\r\n\r\nIn the carrefours of Provins, it was proclaimed that no inhabitant of\r\nthe town, under pain of a fine of one hundred livres _tournois_ and\r\nimprisonment, should leave it, and that every man at the hour of ten in\r\nthe morning must report with his arms before the house of his sergeant\r\n(_dizainier_) for the purpose of mounting guard upon the walls, each in\r\nhis own part of the city. Everybody in the surrounding country began\r\nto vacate their houses and to drive their cattle into the town. On the\r\nevening before Easter messengers of Provins reported that the reiters\r\nwere near. At this news watchers were set upon the wall of the town,\r\nand a _corps de garde_ posted by the town authorities. On the morning\r\nof the morrow, which was Easter Sunday, the gates of the town were not\r\nopened until eight o’clock, upon which there poured into the town an\r\ninfinite number of wagons and pack-animals laden with the possessions\r\nof the villagers round about. There was hardly room to bestow so many\r\npeople and so many animals. Divine service was celebrated in the parish\r\nchurches, for it was expected that the reiters would take their course\r\ntoward the town, and the people were resolved not to let them enter,\r\nbut to resist to the very last drop of blood.\r\n\r\n In order to ascertain what was the equipment and the arms of each\r\n inhabitant of the town, a general meeting was called at midday for\r\n a view of arms, but it was not possible to hold the meeting because\r\n all the streets and squares were packed with the refugees and their\r\n animals. In consequence of this, local meetings were held in each\r\n of the quarters of the city. Thus the day wore on and consternation\r\n abated only when it was learned that the reiters had gone off toward\r\n the Marne, which they crossed above Coulumiers On the morrow, Easter\r\n Monday, there was no procession in the streets as usual, for fear of\r\n a surprise, and it was not until evening that the people who had found\r\n refuge within the town, began to depart.[695]\r\n\r\nBut the undisguised hostility of Spain to the Edict of Amboise was\r\na greater source of danger to France than protests of the Parlement\r\nor popular violence. “If the heretics obtain their demands with the\r\naid of the English queen,” Chantonnay had threatened on March 6, “the\r\nCatholics in their turn will rise, and they will be sustained by the\r\nKing my master and by all the Catholic princes.”[696] But Catherine was\r\nin no mood to be intimidated. She openly told him that he treated her\r\nas if he governed the country, and charged him with wilful fabrication,\r\nsarcastically adding that she could excuse him for so doing in some\r\ndegree because she knew from whom he derived his opinions, meaning the\r\nconstable and the two deceased members of the Triumvirate.[697] Philip\r\nII’s religious convictions were outraged by the toleration of Calvinism\r\nallowed in the Edict of Amboise, the more so because the queen mother,\r\nin justification of the course of the government, compromised the\r\nchurch at large by declaring that the sole practical solution of\r\nthe difficulty could be accomplished by a true general council of\r\nthe church, and _not_ by the one sitting at Trent, in defiance of\r\nwhose conclusions she asserted the legality and inviolability of the\r\nedict.[698]\r\n\r\nCatherine de Medici was deeply concerned over the conduct of the\r\nCouncil of Trent. For the programme of zealous advocates of the\r\ncounter-Reformation there aimed at church consolidation and the\r\nenlargement of papal authority to such an extent that the immemorial\r\nliberties of the Gallican church, confirmed by the great concordat of\r\n1516, and the rights of the crown over the temporalities of the church\r\nin France were seriously threatened. The complication of the Huguenots\r\nwith England and the murder of the duke of Guise had brought this issue\r\nto a head. In the month in which the duke was assassinated there was\r\na significant meeting of the ambassadors of the ultra-Catholic powers\r\nresident at the French court, in which it was resolved to support\r\nthe Council in matters of religion; to prevent future appropriation\r\nof church revenues by the state under pain of excommunication; to\r\nstamp out heresy; and to avenge the murder of the duke of Guise.[699]\r\nThe cardinal of Lorraine was the chief representative of France at\r\nTrent and perhaps the most conspicuous prelate there. He was bitter\r\nagainst the policy of Charles IX, advocating utter suppression of the\r\nHuguenots. His continuance at Trent, therefore, became a danger to\r\nFrance and Catherine de Medici dexterously found means to remove him by\r\nsending him on special errands to Vienna and Venice, leaving the case\r\nof France at Trent in the hands of the sieur de Lansac, whose loyalty\r\nto the Catholic faith did not subvert his patriotism.[700]\r\n\r\nAside from his religious antagonism, Philip II regarded his own\r\npolitical interests as also jeopardized by the French situation. He\r\nwas alarmed at the possible recovery of Calais by England,[701] and\r\nthe progress of heresy and rebellion in the Netherlands, especially at\r\nValenciennes and Tournay, was certain to be encouraged by the example\r\nof France, while a common effort of the Huguenots of Picardy and those\r\nof the religion across the Flemish border was seriously feared.[702]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE WAR WITH ENGLAND—THE PEACE OF TROYES[703] (1563-64)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe closure of the civil war was a necessary condition precedent to\r\nthe war France now planned to wage with her “adversary of England”\r\nfor the recovery of Havre-de-Grace. Catherine de Medici had paid\r\nColigny’s reiters in order to close the chasm as soon as possible. The\r\nkeen-witted representatives of Queen Elizabeth in France—Throckmorton\r\nand Smith—had done all in their power to diussade the Protestants\r\nfrom making peace.[704] Too late Elizabeth perceived the result of\r\nher procrastination. War between England and France over Havre was\r\ninevitable,[705] though in March the French government dissembled its\r\nreal intention, giving the English to understand that the last portion\r\nof the fourth article of the peace, which referred to putting strangers\r\nout of the realm, applied to the German reiters.[706]\r\n\r\nThe English declared that if the French would restore Calais to the\r\nqueen, Elizabeth would surrender Havre-de-Grace and Dieppe, with all\r\nthat was held by the English in Normandy.[707] But the French contended\r\nthat the English, having occupied Havre-de-Grace, were deprived of all\r\nright to Calais,[708] and declined to entertain such a proffer, hoping\r\nto recover Havre-de-Grace by force[709] and also to remain masters\r\nof Calais by virtue of the treaty of 1559, which provided that if,\r\nduring the term of the treaty, which was to endure for the space of\r\neight years, the English acquired other possessions in France, they\r\nwould immediately lose their right to Calais. To this England replied\r\nthat France had been the first offender, when French troops were sent\r\ninto Scotland in aid of Queen Mary; and that thereby the treaty was\r\nbroken and Calais was due her. Elizabeth refused to see that her own\r\nselfish conduct had compelled the Huguenots to make terms, and bitterly\r\nupbraided the Huguenot leaders for their “desertion.”[710]\r\n\r\nThe determination to push the war proceeded entirely from the queen,\r\nthe chief members of the government having opposed it both because\r\nof the strength of the fortress, which they thought difficult to\r\ntake, and also because of the confusion which still prevailed in\r\nthe kingdom. On April 7 the prince of Condé was established in the\r\nlieutenantship. Marshal Brissac, who was chief military commander, a\r\nweek later quitted Paris for Normandy in company with the Swiss, and\r\nthe whole artillery lately used before Orleans was sent forward.[711]\r\nArtillery and ammunition were sent by the river, and provisions also\r\nwere forwarded. The campaign was delayed until this time for two\r\nreasons: first, to ascertain whether the internal disturbances could\r\nbe quelled and the reiters gotten out of the kingdom, as otherwise it\r\nwould have been perilous to make any movement in the direction of the\r\ncoast; secondly, all the territory of Normandy had been so devasted by\r\nthe war that the army could not be maintained except at very great\r\ncost and inconvenience. Fortunately for the French government anxiety\r\nwith reference to the Emperor’s designs regarding Metz was now removed,\r\nthe cardinal of Lorraine having persuaded Ferdinand that if the Three\r\nBishoprics were restored they would become a refuge for the heretics\r\nfrom Lower Germany and Luxembourg.[712]\r\n\r\nThe queen mother appealed to Paris to obtain 200,000 crowns, and a\r\nroyal edict commanded the clergy to contribute 100,000 _écus de rentes_\r\nannual revenue.[713] At the same time a government _octroi_ upon wines\r\nwas laid for six years, to the dismay of many towns, which opposed\r\nthe execution of the edict, claiming that the vine and wine were\r\ntheir sole means of livelihood.[714] The King also went to Parlement\r\nto obtain pecuniary supplies there against England, saying that the\r\n200,000 crowns from the city was to be used to pay the reiters of the\r\nRhinegrave, who had mutinied for their pay in Champagne, to quit the\r\nkingdom.[715] Paris readily responded, “the Parisians caring not what\r\nthey gave to recover Newhaven;” it had been “a scourge and loss to them\r\nof many millions of francs” during that year.[716]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the position of Warwick in Havre had grown so bad that he\r\nhad expelled all strangers from the town.[717] Anticipating a siege,\r\na new fosse 30 feet wide, 10 feet broad, and 8 feet deep had been\r\nconstructed outside of the old ditch around the town. The delay of\r\nthe English government, however, was fatal to the success of Warwick.\r\nAll his labors went for naught.[718] On May 22 the French assault\r\nupon Havre began in earnest.[719] In the midst of the tedium and\r\nthe anxiety Catherine de Medici dominated all, having no regard for\r\nher own convenience, but being in vigorous action at all hours, and\r\nunder great mental strain most of the time. Yet her patience, her\r\naddress, and her assiduous attention during the time of the siege to\r\nthe councils of the government, and to her continual audiences, were\r\nremarkable. “Her Majesty,” wrote the Venetian ambassador, “exceeds all\r\nthat could be expected from her sex, and even from an experienced man\r\nof valor, or from a powerful king and military captain.” She insisted\r\non being present at all the assaults, and even in the trenches, where\r\ncannon-balls and arquebus-bullets were flying.[720]\r\n\r\nThe character of Catherine de Medici from this time forth, throughout\r\nher long and varied career, continued to fill her subjects with\r\nastonishment. Not even the most consummate courtier could have\r\npraised her beauty. She had big eyes and thick lips, like Leo X, her\r\ngreat-uncle.[721] She possessed, too, the characteristics of her\r\nfamily. She loved to erect public edifices; to collect books. She made\r\na profession of satisfying everybody, at least in words, of which she\r\nwas not saving. Her industry in public business was the subject of\r\nastonishment. Nothing was too small for her notice. She could neither\r\neat nor drink without talking politics. She followed the army without\r\nregard to her health or even her life. Her physical characteristics, if\r\nnot the admiration, were certainly the wonder of all. She was fond of\r\ngood-living, eating much and irregularly, and was addicted to physical\r\nexercise, especially hunting, which she also followed for the purpose\r\nof reducing her weight. With this design, incredible as it may seem,\r\nshe often rode clad in heavy furs.[722] When fifty years of age she\r\ncould walk so fast that no one in the court was willing to follow her.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of the French in the siege of Havre-de-Grace were\r\nvery great. The locality was surrounded for the distance of a mile by\r\nmarsh and by the waters of the sea, which were cut by inaccessible\r\ncanals. There was a strand of sand on the seaside only about thirty\r\nyards distant from the wall at low tide. The besiegers passed along the\r\nshore, somewhat concealed by the sand and gravel cast up by the sea,\r\nand wedged themselves and their artillery between this strand and the\r\nsea, and opened fire. By the end of July the French had approached so\r\nnear the walls of Havre-de-Grace that they were almost able to batter\r\nthem point-blank, and the besieged went out to parley and demanded four\r\ndays’ time to communicate with England.[723]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH MAP OF THE FORTIFICATIONS OF HAVRE-DE-GRACE\r\n\r\nDated July 15, 1563. Original in Public Record Office, State Papers,\r\nForeign, Elizabeth, Vol. XL, No. 919.]\r\n\r\nThe garrison was reduced to a sorry plight, for the French were about\r\nto storm the place, as they had already battered effectually and\r\ndismantled a bulwark and several towers of the fort and filled up the\r\nwhole moat, so that with but a little more work they would have opened\r\na road for themselves securely with a spade. They had, moreover, a\r\nbattery of forty cannon, so that while only twenty or thirty shots each\r\nday formed the usual feature of a siege at this time, the French now\r\nfired more than a hundred and twenty shots.[724] At last on July 28\r\nWarwick agreed to surrender Havre-de-Grace, and to embark in four days.\r\nTwo days later the English admiral Clinton appeared in sight, with\r\nthirty ships and five galliots. The French artillery was then directed\r\ntoward the sea, so the admiral set sail the next evening with the\r\nfleet, and the French army entered on Sunday, August 1, 1563.[725]\r\n\r\nThe capture of Havre was of immense immediate advantage to France,\r\nespecially to Normandy, Havre being the door through which all\r\nthe traffic and commerce entered, not only to Rouen, but also to\r\nNormandy, and to a great part of France. Without this commerce\r\nNormandy-of-the-Seine suffered greatly.[726]\r\n\r\nBut Elizabeth was reluctant to believe that she had been beaten,\r\nand the autumn of the year witnessed tedious negotiations.[727] The\r\nchief difficulty between the two crowns turned on the restitution of\r\nCalais. The French insisted that they were absolved from the terms of\r\nCateau-Cambrésis through the action taken by England in the matter of\r\nHavre-de-Grace; that thereby forfeiture of the English right to Calais\r\nwas made.[728] Elizabeth, on the other hand, would not make peace\r\nunless her pretensions were recognized.[729]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, in the seas of Flanders, France, and England\r\nthousands of acts of piracy were committed, and trade in the Channel\r\nwas quite interrupted.[730] A partial agreement at last was patched\r\nup. On April 11, 1564, the treaty of peace was signed at Troyes,[731]\r\nthe articles yielding Havre-de-Grace to France, in return for 120,000\r\ngold crowns, a sum which the English grudgingly took, though they\r\nhad demanded a half million, the terms also providing for property\r\nindemnifications and freedom of commerce between the two nations.\r\n\r\nNothing was specified as to Calais. After three years of negotiations\r\nthe question still remained unsettled. In June, 1567, Sir Thomas Smith,\r\nElizabeth’s ambassador, demanded the restitution of Calais. Charles was\r\nevasive, saying that the messenger must be content to wait till the\r\nKing had obtained the consent of his council, before whom the King told\r\nSmith openly that he would not restore Calais, but would hold it as the\r\npossession of his ancestors, to which the queen of England had no just\r\nright. When the ambassador replied, citing the word of the treaty, the\r\nchancellor answered that the promise had been given under the express\r\nconditions that the English queen should not in any way molest the\r\nsubjects or territory of France or Scotland, but from what had taken\r\nplace at Havre-de-Grace it appeared manifest that she had forfeited all\r\nclaims which she might have had to Calais. The King’s rejoinder was\r\nnotable in that it is so excellent an example of the French doctrine of\r\n“natural frontiers,” Charles IX replying to the effect that the queen\r\nought not to regret the loss of Calais, knowing that of old it was the\r\npossession of the crown of France, and that God had willed it to return\r\nto its first master, and that the two realms ought to remain content\r\nwith the frontiers created for them by nature and with a boundary so\r\nclearly defined as the sea.[732]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nEARLY LOCAL AND PROVINCIAL CATHOLIC LEAGUES\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to her own enterprise in pushing the war which had culminated\r\nwith so much honor to France, and partly also to her skilful handling\r\nof the factions at court, Catherine de Medici was now in enjoyment\r\nof supreme power. The entire weight of the government rested on her\r\nshoulders, there being no longer any other person who controlled public\r\naffairs. The Guises and Châtillon factions were full of animosity\r\ntoward one another, for Madame de Guise refused to recognize the\r\nadmiral’s acquittal for the murder of her husband;[733] Montmorency\r\nwas deeply offended because the young duke of Guise received the\r\ngrand-mastership and the gift of the duchy of Châtellerault, and so\r\nfeigned to have the gout in order to avoid service before Havre; Condé\r\nwas doubly angry at the queen, both because she withheld the promised\r\nlieutenant’s commission and because the daughter of Marshal St. André,\r\nwho left a great fortune, was not permitted to marry his son. The\r\nparties were, therefore, in a triangular relation toward one another\r\nand Catherine’s art was bent upon maintaining the balance in order to\r\nhold her own.[734]\r\n\r\nThe population of the wittiest city in Europe was quick to perceive\r\nthe animosities and paradoxes that existed. “The Parisians have three\r\nthings to wonder at,” the saying went, “the constable’s beads, the\r\nchancellor’s mass, and the cardinal Châtillon’s red cap. One is ever\r\nmumbling over his beads and his head is ever occupied with other\r\naffairs; the other hears mass daily and is the chief Huguenot in\r\nFrance; the third wears a cardinal’s cap and defies the Pope.”[735] The\r\nqueen mother had hoped that religious animosities would be forgotten\r\nin the course of the war with England. But she was disappointed. The\r\npeace of Amboise could not be enforced. Even in Paris armed troops\r\nand armed guards had to patrol the streets to prevent outbreaks of\r\nviolence.[736] It was impossible to disarm the Catholics, who made\r\nhouse-to-house searches to ferret out Huguenots.[737] Under the terms\r\nof pacification the Protestants were permitted to return to Paris,\r\nbut who dared avail himself of so precarious a liberty? Instead, they\r\nwere compelled to sacrifice their property.[738] In the provinces the\r\nsame condition of things prevailed—in Languedoc, in the Orléannais,\r\nin the Lyonnais.[739] In Languedoc the association of the Huguenots\r\nmaintained its organization, raised money, levied troops.[740] Yet in\r\nspite of its failure to enforce pacification, the government required\r\nthe demolition of the walls of towns known to be Huguenot strongholds,\r\nas Orleans, Montauban, and St. Lô, a procedure which the Protestants\r\nstrongly resisted; so that a condition of petty civil war existed\r\nthroughout much of France, the Edict of Amboise notwithstanding.[741]\r\nSummarized, the troubles of France at this time may be said to have\r\nbeen the feud between the house of Guise and that of Châtillon—a feud\r\nwhich compromised the crown and most of the other great families of\r\nthe kingdom; the queen’s ambition to govern, which led her to nourish\r\nthe quarrel; religious intolerance; the poverty of the crown; the\r\nuncertainty of its foreign relations; and finally the detriment to its\r\ncommerce on account of the war with England, which deprived France of\r\nfour or five millions of gold.[742]\r\n\r\nEven before peace was made between France and England it had been\r\ndecided that the King should make a tour of the provinces for the\r\nbetter pacification of the country.[743] A programme of administrative\r\nand financial reform was developed at the same time. The army was to\r\nbe reduced; in place of the royal garrisons there was to be a “belle\r\nmilice” of forty ensigns of footmen, ten each in Picardy, Normandy,\r\nLanguedoc, and Dauphiné. These troops were to be supported partly by\r\nthe crown, partly by the provinces. The Scotch Guard was to be cut\r\ndown. Through the church’s aid twelve millions of the public debt,\r\nincluding the unpaid balance of the dowries of Elizabeth of Spain and\r\nthe duchess of Savoy, were to be paid off within six years and the\r\nalienated domains of the crown redeemed.[744] Already Charles IX’s\r\nmajority had been declared at Rouen, during the course of the siege\r\nof Havre[745]—a dexterous stroke of the queen mother to thwart the\r\nambitions of the factions.[746]\r\n\r\nIn the early spring of 1564 the court set out from Fontainebleau, and\r\nthence went to Sens and Troyes, where the peace was signed; from Troyes\r\nthe way led to Bar-le-Duc and Nancy. But the journey of the King,\r\ninstead of allaying the disquietude of the Huguenots, alarmed them\r\nstill more. For the strongest overtures were made to the King to break\r\nthe peace of Amboise, not only by provincial authorities[747] but also\r\nthrough the ambassadors of certain of the Catholic powers.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Trent had finished its labors with somewhat unseemly\r\nhaste on December 4, 1563, on account of the anticipated decease\r\nof Pius IV,[748] and strong pressure was brought upon the French\r\nand Spanish governments to accept its findings.[749] The Pope, in\r\nconsistory, accepted them in their integrity, on January 26, 1564.[750]\r\nBut various European governments, especially France, strongly objected\r\nto the findings as prejudicial to the interests of monarchy.[751]\r\nOn the first Monday in Lent the cardinal of Lorraine presented the\r\ndecrees of Trent to the King in council and others of the Parlement,\r\nurging that their adoption was necessary for the repose of the kingdom.\r\nThe debate which followed, in a certain sense was a test of strength\r\nbetween the moderate Catholic party, led by the chancellor L’Hôpital\r\nand the Guises. Much objection was made to the findings, especially by\r\nthe chancellor, who asserted that they were contrary to the privileges\r\nof the Gallican church, and that the cardinal’s party was now trying\r\nto compass by craft what they had failed to do by force of arms. The\r\ncardinal rejoined with words to the effect that L’Hôpital was unmindful\r\nof the benefits he had received of them (the Guises), using the word\r\n“ingrate” (_ingrat_). To this the chancellor haughtily returned that he\r\nhad never received any benefits from the cardinal or his family, that\r\nhe had only filled the post of _maître de requêtes_, which was not a\r\nhigh office, and that he did not desire to pay his debts at the expense\r\nof the King’s sovereignty by voting in favor of the decrees. In the\r\nend, France refused to accept all of the findings.[752]\r\n\r\nWith the closing of the Council of Trent, the representatives of\r\nthe ultra-Catholic powers, notably Spain and Savoy, intimated to\r\nCharles IX that their sovereigns would assist him in the extirpation\r\nof heresy in France. The offer was both a promise and a menace, the\r\nimplication being that the Catholic world at large would not tolerate\r\nthe recognition of Protestantism accorded by France and that a joint\r\naction of the powers most concerned might compel the king of France to\r\nlive up to his title of Most Christian King. The cardinal of Lorraine\r\nhad carried the idea of the Triumvirate to Trent with him,[753] and on\r\nthe floor of the Council had proposed the formation of an association\r\nto be called “The Brotherhood of Catholics in France.” He offered to\r\nsecure the co-operation of his nephews, relatives, and friends, and\r\nreturned to France with the consent of the Pope for that purpose.[754]\r\nThe Triumvirate, as we have seen, had already made overtures to Spain,\r\nto which Philip II had responded with cordial, if no very definite\r\nsentiments, and from the time of the promulgation of the Edict of\r\nJanuary and the formation of the Triumvirate, the idea of a Catholic\r\nleague in which the Pope and the king of Spain were to be the chief\r\npillars, begins to take shape.[755] The mission of Louis de St. Gelais,\r\nsieur de Lansac, to Trent and Rome in this month, was partly to prevent\r\nthe formation of such a league, and partly to persuade the Pope to\r\napprove the French government’s appropriation of the property of the\r\nchurch. Granvella was not unfavorable to the idea, though in his eyes\r\nsuch a league should be formed, not for the purpose of intervening in\r\nFrance, but as a defensive measure, lest Catherine endeavor to profit\r\nby the critical situation prevailing in the Spanish Netherlands and\r\ninterfere there in order to divert the discontent of the French from\r\nhome affairs, and to prevent the Protestants of the Netherlands from\r\nassisting their coreligionists in France.[756]\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of civil war after the massacre of Vassy and the seizure\r\nof Havre-de-Grace by the English had convinced Philip II that the time\r\nto act had come in France, and Spanish troops and Spanish money were\r\nput at the disposal of the Guises, although Philip denied to England\r\nthat he was giving succor to Catholic France.[757] In May, and again\r\nin August of 1562, the Triumvirate appealed to Philip II,[758] and\r\non June 6 the Spanish King wrote to the regent in the Netherlands to\r\nsend the Triumvirate assistance. But the order was easier to give\r\nthan to execute, and exactly a month later (July 6) both Margaret and\r\nGranvella replied, asserting the impracticability of carrying out\r\nPhilip’s wishes on the ground that no money could be procured from the\r\nestates for such a purpose.[759] In the meantime, the cardinal-legate\r\nin France, convinced that “in order to lay the ax at the root of the\r\nevil, there was no shorter way and no better expedient than recourse to\r\narms,”[760] and impatient of Spain’s slow reply to the petition of the\r\nTriumvirate,[761] stirred up both the Vatican and the court of Madrid\r\nto livelier action.[762] As a result, although it was against their\r\nbetter judgment, Margaret and Granvella prevailed upon the Council of\r\nState in August to appropriate 50,000 écus for the war in France, and\r\nin September 3,000 Italians were sent from Franche Comté to the aid of\r\nTavannes in Burgundy.[763]\r\n\r\nThe elements of the future Holy League are here manifest as early as\r\n1561-62. But apart from the course being followed out in high political\r\ncircles, at the same time, popular associations for the maintenance\r\nof the Catholic religion were being formed within France. The years\r\n1562-63 witnessed the formation of several provincial leagues and town\r\nassociations, which were the real roots of the Holy League.\r\n\r\nThe people of the capital had begun to manifest their prejudices in an\r\norganized military form as early as 1562, and the government, instead\r\nof suppressing this tendency, encouraged it. On May 2, 1562, the\r\nParlement of Paris passed an ordinance ordering the _échevins_ and all\r\nloyal Catholics in each quarter of the city to organize under arms,\r\nwith captains, corporals, and sergeants.[764] But the preponderance of\r\nParis in the formation of the Holy League has been exaggerated. When it\r\nbecame a national affair, Paris, as the capital and most Catholic city\r\nof France, seized hold of it and made it her own. But it is inverting\r\nthings to say that Paris gave the League to the provinces. Rather\r\nParis identified herself with their interests, and reflected their\r\npassions and their character, “fierce in Languedoc, sullenly obstinate\r\nin Brittany, everywhere modified in its nature and its devotion by the\r\npolitics of the towns.”[765]\r\n\r\nThe south of France was far more aggressive than the north in this\r\nparticular, and anti-Protestant associations were formed in many\r\nprovinces to the disquietude of the government, which knew not how to\r\ncontrol them.[766] The earliest of such local associations formed by\r\nthe Catholics seems to have been one of Bordeaux, where the people\r\nwere organized after the Protestant attempt to gain possession of the\r\nChâteau Trompette in Francis II’s reign.[767] This association formed\r\nin Bordeaux is the germ of the Catholic League which later expanded\r\nover the Bordelais and Gascony. Other portions of France followed\r\nsuit. In November, 1562, the Association of Provence was formed at\r\nAix and terrorized the Huguenots.[768] Toulouse was notoriously\r\nCatholic, and street wars between Catholics and Protestants were of\r\ncommon occurrence. A more than usually violent outburst of popular\r\nfury here culminated on March 2, 1563, in the formation of a Catholic\r\nLeague, of which the cardinals Armagnac and Strozzi, lieutenants of\r\nthe King in the sénéschaussées of Toulouse and Albi, the president of\r\nthe Parlement, Du Faur, who was advocate-general of the crown, certain\r\neminent knights of the Order, and the famous Montluc, were sponsors.\r\nThe immediate occasion of this outbreak at Toulouse seems to have\r\nbeen the combination of fury and fear of a plot which the Catholics\r\nfelt when they learned of the duke of Guise’s assassination. When the\r\noutbreak began, the president of the Parlement of Toulouse hastily\r\ndispatched a messenger to Montluc entreating him to come to their\r\nassistance. Upon Montluc’s arrival at Toulouse the leaders prayed him\r\nto put himself at the head of the troops in the province against the\r\nHuguenots.\r\n\r\nMontluc at first made some difficulty about consenting to this request,\r\nbecause he had no permission from Damville, the governor of Languedoc,\r\nin which province Toulouse was located, and who, moreover, was not\r\none of his friends.[769] Finally, however, he yielded to their\r\nrequest, and measures were taken to put an army on foot in thirty days.\r\nThose who composed this assembly drew up the compact of a league or\r\nassociation on March 2, 1563, which was to be observed by the clergy,\r\nthe nobility, and the third estate in the towns and dioceses within\r\nthe jurisdiction of the parlement of Toulouse, both in Languedoc and\r\nGuyenne. According to the articles of this association the members\r\nengaged to bear arms, and to make oath between the hands of those\r\ncommissioned by the Parlement, or by the King’s lieutenant in the\r\ncountry, to march whenever required for the defense of the Catholic\r\nreligion. The parlement of Toulouse approved and authorized this\r\nassociation on March 20, provisionally and without charges, “subject\r\nto the good pleasure of the King.” In the name of this league taxes\r\nwere laid, men were levied, and an inventory of arms made in every\r\n_généralité_ and diocese.[770]\r\n\r\nMontluc had come to Toulouse, fresh from the formation of another and\r\nearlier league for the preservation of the Catholic faith, in Agen,\r\nwhich had been organized on February 4, 1563. This league was a direct\r\nconsequence of the siege of Lectoure and the battle of Vergt. Montluc\r\nhad received orders to report, with the marshal Termes, to the King in\r\nthe camp before Orleans. But the Agenois was not quite pacified and the\r\ngentry of the country were so filled with alarm, that they concluded,\r\nso Montluc naïvely says, “that in case I should resolve to go away to\r\nthe King, as his Majesty commanded, and offer to leave them without a\r\nhead, they must be fain to detain me in the nature of a prisoner.”[771]\r\nThe upshot of things was that the “Confederation and Association\r\nof the town and city of Agen and other towns and jurisdictions of\r\nAgen” was formed and organized on February 4, 1563, with a captain,\r\nlieutenant, sergeants, corporals, and other necessary officers, in\r\norder to extirpate the Huguenots from the region. It was an oath-bound\r\ncovenant.[772]\r\n\r\nThe examples of Agen and Toulouse were contagious, and the popular\r\nhatred of the Huguenots, on account of the assassination of the duke of\r\nGuise, induced the spread of these local leagues. On March 13, 1563,\r\nthe Catholic lords of Guyenne also entered into a league at Cadillac\r\non the same plan and for the same object as that of the Catholics of\r\nAgen and Languedoc.[773] Like the earlier ones, the league of Guyenne\r\nwas organized by parishes, districts, sénéschaussées and provinces,\r\nunder the direction of one supreme chief assisted by a council chosen\r\nfrom the third estate. In the north of France, as has been observed,\r\nthe tendency of the Catholics to associate was not so strong as in\r\nthe south. There is evidence of a weak association of the Catholics\r\nin the towns of the Rouennais and the lower part of the Ile-de-France\r\nin 1563,[774] and of a town league in Anjou and Maine.[775] But no\r\nformidable Catholic association was formed north of the Loire, until\r\nthe appearance of the Confrérie du St. Esprit in 1568, under the\r\nmarshal Tavannes.\r\n\r\nThe nucleus of many of these Catholic associations, before they\r\nexpanded into provincial leagues, in most cases seems to have been a\r\nlocal guild or confraternity[776] of some nature. These were closely\r\nconnected with the body of tradesmen, each trade having its patron\r\nsaint, its sacred banner, and devoted bands; but some of the more\r\naristocratic people were joined with the artisans. The members had\r\nfixed places of meeting and certain days on which to assemble, common\r\nexercises, and often a common meal. They swore to use their wealth and\r\ntheir life, if need be, for the defense of their faith.[777]\r\n\r\nThe new rôle now begun to be played by these ancient guilds is an\r\ninteresting phase of the religious wars. If France in the sixteenth\r\ncentury was laboring in the throes of a religious revolution, she was\r\nalso in a state of industrial transformation. In origin the economic\r\nrevolution was independent of the Reformation, yet so influential\r\nwere its social and economic effects upon the Reformation that in a\r\nvery true sense the religious movement may be said to have been the\r\nsubordinate one.[778] The identity and fulness of this change in the\r\nold order of things coincides with the Reformation, which in large\r\npart became the vehicle of its expression. The crisis coincides with\r\nthe reign of Charles IX and Henry III, although the beginnings of\r\nit are very manifest in the time of Louis XI (cf. the ordinances of\r\n1467, 1474-76, 1479). The change particularly involved the guilds,\r\nwhose traditional practices had now reached the point of an industrial\r\ntyranny. More and more, from the middle of the fifteenth century,\r\ncontrol of the guilds had tended to fall into the hands of a few. This\r\ngrowth of a social hierarchy within the guilds had serious political\r\nand economic results. For inasmuch as city government was so largely\r\nan out-growth of guild life, this exclusiveness threw political\r\ncontrol of the cities into the hands of a “ring” composed of the upper\r\nbourgeoisie, who formed an oligarchy and gradually squeezed the lower\r\nclasses out of all participation in the government. The general body of\r\nthe commonalty everywhere, in France, in Germany, in England, tended to\r\ndisappear or to be replaced by a select group from the inner circle of\r\nthe guild. The lower bourgeoisie was shut out of the council at Nevers\r\nin 1512, at Sens in 1530, at Rheims in 1595.\r\n\r\nBut the economic revolution implied in this change was of far\r\ngreater importance than the political. The _gens de métier_ became\r\na monopolist, a capitalist class, controlling the “hoards” of the\r\nguilds as well as being the ruling class in local politics. The old\r\nguild was transformed into a mercantile association, operated in favor\r\nof a few rich families who were possessed of capital and regulated\r\nwages and fixed the term of apprenticeship to their own advantage.\r\nIn order to secure cheap labor the masters increased the number of\r\napprentices, lengthened the time of service, raised the requirements\r\nof the _chef-d’œuvre_, made membership in the guild increasingly\r\ndifficult, and reduced wages by employing raw, underpaid workmen in\r\ncompetition with skilled labor. The result was that the distance\r\nwidened continually between the upper and lower working classes.[779]\r\nThe social democracy and honorable estate of guild life, as it had\r\nbeen in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, passed away and was\r\nreplaced by a strife between labor and capital, between organized labor\r\nand free labor, which brings the sixteenth century, remote as it is in\r\ntime, very near to us in certain of its economic conditions.\r\n\r\nTo be sure there were some things which partially neutralized this\r\nantagonism, such as better facility in communication, the increase of\r\nproduction, the activity of exchange, the invention of new industrial\r\nprocesses, and the opening of new industries, notably printing and\r\nsilk manufacture.[780] But nothing compensated the workman for the\r\nrise in the price of necessities of life due to the influx of gold and\r\nsilver from America, for his wages did not rise in proportion. In\r\nconsequence the cleavage grew more and more sharp. The result of this\r\ntendency was that poor workmen, despairing of getting economic justice\r\nfrom the guilds, took to working in their own quarters. So common was\r\nthis practice in the sixteenth century that a new word was coined to\r\ndefine this unapprenticed class—- _chambrelons_. These plied their\r\ntrades in their own houses and sold the product of their handicraft\r\nanywhere. As early as 1457, and again in 1467, the masters complain of\r\nthis practice.[781] It is easy to understand the disastrous influence\r\nof this new form of industry upon guild labor, since the new class of\r\nworkmen was not subject either to the same money charges or to the same\r\nrestrictive regulations. It was “unfair” competition for the old order\r\nof things which reposed upon the maintenance of an economic equilibrium\r\nbetween demand and supply, between labor and capital, was upset by the\r\nnew tendencies.\r\n\r\nTo the toiling masses trodden down by the masters and economically\r\ntyrannized over, the Reformation came as the first _organized_ movement\r\nof discontent, and hosts of dissatisfied workmen throughout Germany\r\nand France hastened to identify themselves with Protestantism, not for\r\nreligious reasons, but because the Reformation constituted exactly\r\nthat for which they were seeking—a protest. The situation was further\r\naggravated by the influx of foreign workmen, chiefly from Germany,\r\nwhere this economic revolution was earlier and more fully developed\r\nthan elsewhere in Europe, in great industrial centers like Nürnberg,\r\nand where small German workmen were more completely shut out than was\r\nthe case in France or England. These men—such as cobblers, shoemakers,\r\ncarpenters, wool-carders, and other simple artisans—wandered over the\r\ncountry from one province to another, carrying the economic gospel\r\nof free labor and the religion of Lutheranism with them. Naturally\r\nthey imbued their French fellow-workmen with their sentiments—and\r\nto such an extent that for years, during the early course of the\r\ncivil wars, the Huguenots were commonly called “Lutherans.” Before\r\n1560, the greater portion of the Protestant party was made up of\r\nwoolcombers, fullers, drapers, weavers, shoemakers, hosiers, dyers,\r\ntailors, hatters, joiners, glaziers, bookbinders, locksmiths, cutlers,\r\npewterers, coopers, etc.[782] Even as late as 1572, when the Huguenot\r\nmovement had for twelve years been led by noblemen like the Châtillons\r\nand the Rohans, the Venetian ambassador still characterized the\r\nHuguenots as “a sect which consists for the most part of craftsmen, as\r\ncobblers, tailors, and such ignorant people.”[783]\r\n\r\nCoupled with this religious and economic revolution, went also a change\r\nin the manners of society, which pervaded all classes—a change which\r\nbegan in the reign of Francis I and was continued under Henry II. The\r\nnew internationalism of France, due to the Italian wars, was probably\r\nthe initial cause of this. Returned soldiers, laden with the pay of\r\nbooty of warfare, brought back into France the manners and customs\r\nof Italy, which commingled with the manners and customs introduced by\r\nwandering workmen from Germany and Switzerland.[784]\r\n\r\nThe revision of the statutes of the guilds was one of the minor\r\nfeatures of the reform programme of the political Huguenots in the\r\nStates-General of Orleans, and the _Cahier-général_ of the third\r\nestate which was compiled from the local _cahiers_ presented by the\r\ndeputies shows traces of the interest of France at large in the issue.\r\nUnfortunately these fuller local records are lost.[785] But this\r\nrevision only looked to a modernizing of the mediaeval language of\r\nthe _ordonnances_, which chiefly dated from the fourteenth century,\r\nand did not contemplate an entire recasting of them, so as to make\r\nthem harmonize with the new industrial conditions. Only one man\r\nin the assembly seems to have appreciated the real condition of\r\nthings. This was the chancellor L’Hôpital. Not content with the mild\r\nreorganization of the guilds recommended by the third estate, on the\r\nlast day of the session, January 31, 1561, the chancellor drew up\r\nthe famous ordinance of Orleans.[786] The intent of this statute was\r\nindirectly to restrain the enlarged economic tyranny of the guilds, to\r\nlessen the burden of apprenticeship, and to establish freer laboring\r\nconditions. This purpose the government aimed to attain by dissolving\r\nthe confraternities, for by striking at these it really struck the\r\nguilds, since many of these associations were one and the same. No\r\ndistinction was made between associations whose character was religious\r\nor charitable, and those composed of patrons and workingmen; all the\r\nconfraternities were grouped together and governmental supervision was\r\nprovided for. They were not legislated out of existence by the new\r\naction, but reduced to a partial dissolution. Their accumulated hoards\r\nof capital were ordered to be expended for the support of schools and\r\nhospitals and similar institutions in the towns and villages where\r\nthese various guilds were, and only a limited amount of money was left\r\nin their hands. The municipal officers, in co-operation with those of\r\nthe crown were made personally responsible for the execution of this\r\nmeasure in every bailiwick. It is important to notice the significance\r\nof this course. The government, in fact, was pursuing a policy of\r\npartial secularization of the property of these confraternities for\r\nthe benefit of the people at large, and compelling distribution of the\r\ngreat sums locked up in the hands of the guilds in much the same way\r\nthat the church had come to possess enormous sums in mortmain. This\r\nlegislation, if it had really been effective, would have destroyed the\r\nguilds.\r\n\r\nThe guilds thus put upon the defensive, owing to the reforming policy\r\nof the crown and the political Huguenots, sought to save themselves by\r\npleading that they were religious associations. By this adroit movement\r\nthey gained the support of the Catholic party. But the crown refused\r\nto yield, and we find the _Confréries de métiers_ directly supervised\r\nin letters-patent of February 5, 1562, and December 14, 1565. Coupled\r\nwith these measures, we find others forbidding banquets, festivals,\r\nand like celebrations (edicts of December 11, 1566, and of February\r\n4, 1567) which by this time had become centers of religious agitation\r\namong the Catholics. But the government could not maintain its course.\r\nThe identification of the guilds and confraternities with the Catholic\r\nparty gave them great and unexpected support. Under the new order\r\nof things they became the nuclei of local and provincial Catholic\r\nleagues.[787] In other words, the labor party became identified with\r\nthe Huguenots, while the upper bourgeoisie, controlling the guilds,\r\nadhered to the Catholic cause—at Rouen in 1560 the merchants actually\r\ndeclared a lock-out against workmen who attended preachings[788]—and\r\nbecame the nuclei of the provincial leagues, exactly as in France in\r\n1793 every Jacobin club became an arm of the Terror government.\r\n\r\nIt was said at the time, and has often been asserted since, that\r\nthese local Catholic leagues were but protective associations in the\r\nbeginning and formed to repel Huguenot violence.[789] The Huguenots\r\npracticed as violent methods as their religious opponents and their\r\noffenses were as numerous; but with the exception of the Huguenot\r\nassociation in Dauphiné, there is no early example of a Protestant\r\nassociation similar to the leagues of the Catholics in the provinces.\r\nThe Protestant local organizations were not so highly developed, in\r\na military sense, as early as this, nor were they of the same form\r\nas those of the Catholics. Montluc himself, than whom there is no\r\nbetter judge, testifies that in the war in Guyenne in 1562 “they\r\nshowed themselves to be novices, and indeed they were guided by their\r\nministers.” The Protestants had a sort of triumvirate, it is true, in\r\nthe two Châtillon brothers, and the prince of Condé, but their work\r\nonly remotely partakes of the policy of the real Triumvirate; even\r\ntheir appeal to Elizabeth did not contemplate such radical conduct as\r\nthe Triumvirate displayed.[790]\r\n\r\nNo Huguenot leader ever thought of subordinating the government of\r\nFrance to a foreign ruler for the maintenance of the faith he believed\r\nin,[791] as the Guises, Montmorency, and St. André did. Condé’s\r\ndeclaration that the civil war was caused by the Triumvirate’s action\r\nhad much truth in it. The rules of the association which the Huguenots\r\nformed at Orleans, on April 11, 1562, were as much a body of military\r\nregulations for the discipline of the army as they were a political\r\ncompact, as a reading of the articles will prove.[792] There was little\r\nof the politico-military character of the Catholic leagues about\r\nit. It is not until after the Bayonne episode that we find a solid\r\nfederation of the Reformed churches beginning to form, and the first\r\ntest of the Protestant organization was made at the beginning of the\r\nsecond civil war.[793] This is not the place, however, to dwell upon\r\nits development. In due time the subject will be taken up.\r\n\r\nThe edict confirming the act of pacification (March 19, 1563) in its\r\nsixth article forbade the formation of any leagues in the future,\r\nand ordered the dissolution of those already in existence.[794] This\r\nprohibition was a dead letter from the beginning. The government not\r\nonly was unable to prevent the formation of new leagues; it was even\r\nunable to suppress those already in existence.[795] When the first\r\ncivil war ended, there were three well-organized Catholic leagues in\r\nsouthern France, namely those of Provence, of Toulouse, and of Agen.\r\nCatherine de Medici, who, for some months to come, continued to give\r\nsubstantial manifestation of her desire for peace,[796] in announcing\r\nthe act of Amboise to Montluc, demanded the dissolution of these\r\nassociations. Instead of so doing, however, Candalle, Montluc’s chief\r\nagent in Guyenne, continued his activities. On March 13, 1563, as has\r\nbeen noticed, in defiance of the impending edict of pacification (which\r\nwas completed and only awaited promulgation) the Catholic seigneurs of\r\nGuyenne, at Cadillac (near Bordeaux) entered into a league identical\r\nin purpose and in form with those of Agen and Languedoc.[797] This\r\nleague, which is the germ of that which spread over Gascony, seems to\r\nhave been denounced to the government by Lagebaston, the president of\r\nthe parlement of Bordeaux, between whom and Montluc there was friction,\r\npartly because of Montluc’s preference for Agen as a working capital\r\nfor the region, partly because of his notorious dislike of the lawyer\r\nclass, whose disposition to regard forms of law and vested right\r\ninterfered with Montluc’s high-handed and arbitrary management of\r\naffairs.[798] This new league in such glaring violation of the edict,\r\ncalled forth a sharp letter of rebuke from the queen mother to Montluc\r\non March 31. After alluding in a general way to “les maulx” due to the\r\nexistence of “les partialitez et les associations, qui se sont faictes”\r\nshe says:\r\n\r\n J’ay esté advertye qu’il s’en est faicte une autre en la Guyenne dont\r\n est chef Monsieur de Candalle, laquelle encores qu’elle ayt esté\r\n faicte à bonne intention durant la guerre, si n’est-ce que, cessant\r\n la dicte guerre et se faisant la paix, elle n’est plus nécessaire\r\n et ne la peult ung roy trouver bonne, ny que ceulx qui veullent\r\n estre estimez obéyssans ne peuvent soustenir sans encourir le mesme\r\n cryme de rebellion dont ilz ont accusé leurs adversaires. Et pour\r\n ceste cause, et que le Roy monsieur mon filz n’est pas délibéré d’en\r\n souffrir plus aucun, de quelque costé qu’elle procedde ny permectre\r\n plus à ses subjectz, de quelque religion qu’ilz soient, d’avoir\r\n autre association qu’avec luy et selon son obéyssance, il fault,\r\n Monsieur de Monluc, que, pour le bien de son service, comme il le\r\n vous commande expressément par ses lettres, que vous, qui estes son\r\n lieutenant-général par delà, faciez rompre celle qui s’est faicte\r\n sans permectre qu’ilz ayent aucune force, puissance ou authorité que\r\n celle que vous leur baillerez, ny aucune volunté que d’obéyr à ce que\r\n par vous, pour le bien du service du Roy monsieur mon filz, leur sera\r\n commandé; pour lequel effect j’en scriptz, comme faict le Roy monsieur\r\n mon filz, une lectre audit s^[r] de Candalle et à tous ceulx qui y sont\r\n comprins, comme nous en avons esté bien amplement advertiz.[799]\r\n\r\nUntil the ambition of the Guises created an opposition to them among\r\nthe old-line nobility, and so identified the Huguenot movement with\r\nthe interests of the aristocracy,[800] the French Reformation found\r\nits chief support among the lower bourgeois class in the towns. The\r\nproportion naturally varied from place to place. Lyons, partly from\r\nits proximity to Geneva, but more because of its strong commercial\r\nposition and its great manufacturing interests, among which the silk\r\nindustry was of most importance, was the greatest Huguenot city\r\nin France.[801] Where we find Protestantism prevailing in feudal\r\ndistricts, it is largely to be ascribed to the influence of Protestant\r\ngentleman-farmers, often retired bourgeois, who purchased the county\r\nestates of the older nobility who had been bankrupted by the wars in\r\nItaly and Flanders, or else preferred to live at court. The strongholds\r\nof French Protestantism were the river towns, on the highways of trade,\r\nor sea-ports like Rouen and La Rochelle. Dauphiné, which fattened on\r\nthe commerce out of Italy through the Alpine passes, and Provence which\r\nbordered the Mediterranean, both of which “cleared” through Lyons;\r\nLower Poitou, where La Rochelle was, and Normandy on the Channel were\r\nthe chief Protestant provinces of France. Normandy was probably the\r\nmost Protestant province of all, for here Calvinism not only obtained\r\nin the ports and “good” towns, but in the country areas as well.[802]\r\n\r\nBut there are evidences of the penetration of Protestantism into the\r\ncountry districts elsewhere as well—in Orléannais, Nivernais, Blésois,\r\nthe diocese of Nîmes and even in isolated parts of Champagne and\r\nGascony.[803] In general, however, the French peasantry were strongly\r\nCatholic.\r\n\r\n The reason for this is, first, a social one: while the revolution of\r\n the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was ruinous for the artisan,\r\n it was profitable to the peasant. The rent paid to the landlord,\r\n immutably fixed in the twelfth or thirteenth century, represented\r\n under the new values of money a very light burden, while the fall\r\n in the price of silver considerably raised the nominal worth of\r\n the products of the soil, when the villein sold them. The price of\r\n land was falling rapidly at the very time when the French gentry,\r\n ceasing to be an aristocracy of gentlemen-farmers and becoming a\r\n court-nobility, were compelled to sell their estates to meet their\r\n expenses and, as was said, to put their mills and meadows on their\r\n shoulders. When a lord wished to sell at any price a part of his\r\n estates, there was always, in the parish, a countryman who had been,\r\n as one may say, saving money for centuries, and who, realizing at last\r\n the dream of bygone generations, bought land. Thus did the French\r\n villein become a landowner. The reign of Louis XII and the beginning\r\n of that of Francis I was for the French peasants an epoch of real\r\n prosperity; his situation presented a striking contrast with that of\r\n the German peasant who, at the same date, was in danger of relapsing\r\n into bondage. We may easily understand why there was not in France, as\r\n in Germany, a peasants’ revolution both social and religious.[804]\r\n\r\nBut there are other reasons for the religious growth of the Huguenot\r\ncause among the people not so hard to find. Their ministers preached\r\nin the French language and avoided the use of Latin, which tended\r\nto mystery and obscurity; after sermons the service was continued\r\nwith prayer and the singing of psalms in French rhyme, with vocal\r\nand instrumental music in which the congregation joined. In their\r\nchurch polity, the Huguenots had carried changes farther than had the\r\nReformation elsewhere in Europe. In Germany and England the Reformation\r\nstill adhered to many of the institutions of the mediaeval church,\r\nretaining the episcopate and inferior clergy, as deacons, archdeacons,\r\ncanons, curates, together with vestures, canonical habits, and the use\r\nof ornaments.[805]\r\n\r\nNo reliable estimate can be made of the proportion between Catholics\r\nand Huguenots in the sixteenth century. A remonstrance of 1562 to the\r\nPope declared that one-fourth of France was separate from the communion\r\nof Rome.[806] The Venetian ambassador thought “hardly a third part of\r\nthe people heretical” in 1567.[807] The _échevins_ of Amiens declared\r\nthree-quarters of the inhabitants of Amiens were Protestant in the\r\nsame year.[808] Charles IX in a remonstrance to Pius IV asserted\r\nthat a fourth part of France was Protestant.[809] Montluc, no mean\r\nobserver, estimated that one-tenth of the population of Guyenne was\r\nProtestant.[810] If this proportion be applied to France at large,\r\nthe Huguenots would have numbered something like 1,600,000. Beza,\r\nwho presided over the synod of La Rochelle in 1571, claimed that the\r\nHuguenots had 2,150 congregations, some of them very large, as in the\r\ncase of the church of Orleans, which was said to have 7,000 members.\r\nAt the time of the Colloquy of Poissy, Normandy was said to have 305\r\npastors, Provence 60.[811] But the number of Huguenots in Normandy,\r\nProvence, or the Orléannais was exceptionally large. The average\r\ncongregation must have been small. If we assume that the population\r\nof France was sixteen millions[812] and that one-tenth of the people\r\nwere Calvinist, we would have a total of 1,600,000 Protestants for\r\nall France, which would give an average of about 750 members to each\r\ncongregation on the basis of Beza’s statement as to the number of the\r\nHuguenot churches. This is certainly much too high a figure. Personally\r\nI believe the average was less than half of this. If the congregation\r\naveraged 400 members each, on Beza’s calculation there would have\r\nbeen 860,000 Huguenots in France. A Venetian source of the year 1562\r\nsets the number at 600,000.[813] This may be too low, but all things\r\nconsidered, I believe it not far from the truth. The total Protestant\r\npopulation of France I do not believe to have exceeded three-quarters\r\nof a million before 1572, and after that date it is often difficult to\r\ndistinguish between Huguenots and Politiques.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of things when the first civil war came to an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE TOUR OF THE PROVINCES.[814] THE BAYONNE EPISODE\r\n\r\n\r\n“I am always _en voyage_,” wrote the Venetian ambassador to the senate.\r\n“Since the beginning of my embassy the King has not staid more than\r\nfifteen days in any one place. He goes from Lorraine to Poitou, and\r\nthen to Normandy and the edge of Belgium, back again to Normandy, then\r\nto Paris, Picardy, Champagne, Burgundy.”[815] Dr. Dale wrote in the\r\nsame strain to Lord Burghley: “The Spanish ambassador has a saying that\r\nambassadors in France are eaten up by their horses, since they are\r\nconstrained to keep so many because of the habit of the court of moving\r\nfrom place to place continually.”[816]\r\n\r\nBut there was point to Charles IX’s famous tour of the provinces in\r\n1564-66. The unsettled condition of the country, if no other reason,\r\naccounts for Catherine’s great design of completing the pacification\r\nof the kingdom by having the King tour the realm. The route lay\r\nthrough Sens[817] (March 15) to Troyes (March 23)[818] where the peace\r\nwith England was signed on April 13; thence to Châlons-sur-Marne,\r\nBar-le-Duc, Dijon (May 15), Macon (June 8), and thence to Lyons, where\r\nthe court arrived on June 13. The King traveled with his ordinary\r\ntrain, that is, with his mother, his brother, the duke of Anjou,\r\nthe constable, and the archers of the guard, in order to spare the\r\npeople the burden of great entertainment, and those princes and\r\nnobles who wished to follow were accompanied only by their ordinary\r\nservants.[819] If the Huguenots viewed the King’s sojourn at Bar-le-Duc\r\nwith apprehension,[820] it was not without anxiety that his Catholic\r\nsubjects saw Charles IX visit the great city located at the junction\r\nof the Rhone and the Saône rivers.[821] Lyons seems to have imbibed\r\nsomething of Calvinism from the very waters of the arrowy river whose\r\nsource was the lake of the citadel of Calvinism.[822] The rumor was\r\ncurrent that a greater conspiracy than that of Amboise was on foot;\r\nthat the King and queen were to be deposed and slain, and that Lyons\r\nwould unite with Geneva to form a greater Calvinistic republic.[823]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Tour of the Provinces, 1564-66]\r\n\r\nBut Lyons welcomed the King graciously, and gave him sumptuous\r\naccommodation.[824] Charles was charmed with the reception given him\r\nand amazed at the wealth and commercial prosperity of the city.[825]\r\nSituated at the confluence of the Rhone and the Saône rivers, the\r\nwines and grain of Burgundy came to Lyons for market, while it was\r\nthe natural entrepôt of the commerce out of Italy, besides much that\r\ncame from Spain and Flanders. There were four fairs there each year.\r\nThe great industry of the city was silk manufacturing. In 1450 Charles\r\nVII had granted it the monopoly in this. Francis I in 1536 relieved\r\nthe silk operatives of all taxes and military service. The bulk of the\r\ncommerce was in the hands of Italians, of whom there were said to be\r\nabove twelve thousand in the city—chiefly Florentines, Genoese, and\r\nMilanese.[826] There were also many Germans and Swiss, whose presence\r\ngave the governor, the duke of Nemours,[827] great anxiety, because\r\nlarge quantities of arms were smuggled into the city in the guise of\r\nmerchandise.[828]\r\n\r\nThe court had not been long upon its tour through the provinces before\r\nCatherine de Medici discovered that the petition of the estates of\r\nBurgundy for the abolition of Protestant worship was not merely a local\r\nprejudice, but the sense of the provinces.[829] The elements of this\r\npublic opinion were various: The clergy—not all, however—wanted the\r\nfindings of the Council of Trent accepted _in toto_; all of them were\r\ndissatisfied with the recognition of the rights of the Protestants;\r\nthe alienation of their lands was a grievance to the clergy, the more\r\nso because speculators had bought them at a low price because of the\r\ndoubt as to the validity of the title.[830] The Guises were angry\r\nthat the prosecution of Coligny for the murder of the duke had been\r\nabandoned.[831] Among high and low alike there were unprincipled folk\r\nwho had hopes of profiting by confiscations and forfeitures imposed\r\nupon the Huguenots.[832]\r\n\r\nThe queen mother was too good a politician not to pay heed to these\r\nsigns of popular feeling, more especially as the voice of the provinces\r\nchimed with those in high authority, who not only urged that the war\r\nbe renewed against the Protestants but also hinted broadly of foreign\r\nsupport in aid of the crown. At first Catherine answered graciously,\r\nyet guardedly, to the effect that a peace which had been so solemnly\r\nmade, by the advice of the princes of the blood and the council, could\r\nnot be too lightly cast aside.\r\n\r\nThe miserable effects of the war were everywhere evident. Agriculture\r\nhad almost ceased in a country famous for its fertility, and the whole\r\ncountry had been so plundered and harassed by both parties that the\r\npoor people, being stripped of all their substance, often preferred\r\nto fly to the forests rather than to remain continually exposed to\r\nthe mercy of their enemies. Wandering soldiers and dissolute women,\r\nwith stolen goods in their possession, infested the roads.[833] As to\r\ntrade and manufacturing, the mechanic arts still were plied only in\r\nthe largest and strongest towns; even here merchants and tradesmen had\r\nshut up shop and gone off to war, not always out of religious zeal,\r\nbut in the hope of enriching themselves by spoliation. The nobility\r\nwere divided; the clergy incensed. The civil war had been accompanied\r\nby the attendant aids of violence, robbery, murder, rape, and justice\r\nhad not been administered in the courts for months. The very methods\r\nresorted to for the preservation of religion rendered it hateful in the\r\neyes of many men of both parties. Both parties were bigoted in belief\r\nand in practice. The iconoclasm of the Protestants, who tore down\r\nchurch edifices hoary with age and sanctified by tradition, expelling\r\nthe inmates, both male and female, if doing them no worse injury,\r\nfamiliarized society with changes wrought by violence and made the\r\npeople callous to one of the most precious possessions of a nation—a\r\nreverence for tradition.[834]\r\n\r\nTo all these difficulties the prevalence of the plague must be added.\r\nSince the century of the Black Death Europe had not so suffered\r\nfrom this scourge as in the sixteenth. It recurred intermittently,\r\nbeing especially violent in the years 1531, 1533, 1544, 1546, 1548,\r\n1553, 1562-64, 1568, 1577-80.[835] No part of Europe was spared.\r\nFrance, England, Spain, the Low Countries, Germany, and Italy, all\r\nsuffered. But certain portions of France suffered more than others,\r\nas Bas-Languedoc, Provence, the Lyonnais, Burgundy, Champagne, the\r\nIle-de-France, and Normandy. The west and especially the southwest were\r\nrelatively exempt. Apparently the disease followed the trades-routes\r\nalong the river valleys, for Toulouse, Lyons, Châlons-sur-Saône,\r\nMacon, Châlons-sur-Marne, Langres, Bourges, La Charité, Orleans,\r\nTours, Moulins, Sens, Melun, Dijon, Troyes, Château-Thierry, Soissons,\r\nBeauvais, Pontoise, Paris, Rouen, and the Norman ports suffered\r\nmost.[836] As always, Italy was the immediate source of the epidemic,\r\nwhich was communicated from place to place by the movements of trade.\r\nLyons paid dearly for its commercial pre-eminence, for the ravages of\r\nthe plague were terrible there.[837] It was at its height when the\r\ncourt was there in July, 1564. The English ambassador, Smith, gives a\r\nfearful picture of the state of the city. Men died in the street before\r\nhis lodgings. His servant who went daily for his provisions sometimes\r\nsaw ten and twelve corpses, some naked, lying in the streets where they\r\nlay till “men clothed in yellow” removed them. A great many bodies\r\nwere cast into the river, “because they will not be at the cost to\r\nmake graves. This day,” he writes on July 12, “from break of day till\r\nten o’clock there laid a man naked in the street, groaning and drawing\r\nhis last breath, not yet dead. Round the town there are tents of the\r\npestiferous, besides those which are shut up in their houses.”[838]\r\nAlmost every third house was closed because of the plague. The city\r\nauthorities vainly tried to combat the disease by providing that\r\nvisits were to be made twice a day by those appointed; but as there\r\nwere but five “master surgeons” in the whole city, medical attention\r\nmust have been slight. Persons affected with the plague were to be\r\nremoved to the hospital—the oldest and one of the best in Europe at\r\nthat time. Corpses were to be buried at night and the clothes of the\r\ndead burned.[839] “About the Rhone men dare eat no fish nor fishers\r\nlay their engines and nets, because instead of fish they take up the\r\npestiferous carcasses which are thrown in.” New sanitary regulations\r\nwere made. All filth was to be cast into the river and not allowed to\r\npollute the streets or the river banks. Fires of scented wood were kept\r\nburning between every ten houses in the street. Pigs and other animals\r\nwere not allowed at large. Meat, fish, and vegetable stalls were to be\r\ninspected and all decayed provisions destroyed.[840]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe the efforts made by local authorities to\r\nprevent the spread of the disease and the relief measures that were\r\ntaken. As soon as the plague was discovered, the town authorities\r\nusually set guards to watch the houses of those stricken and appointed\r\nbarbers and gravediggers to treat ill and to inter the dead. These\r\nattendants were supported and paid by a tax laid upon the town. Those\r\nwho were ill were sent to a house of isolation appointed to be a\r\nhospital, which was often upon the walls of the town, remote from the\r\npeople. In Provins the church and cemetery were immediately adjacent\r\nto the hospital! The mortality was great. In Provins in 1562 there\r\nwere eighty persons stricken, of whom sixty died, among them four of\r\nthe attendants. Two of the barber-surgeons refused to serve and were\r\nproceeded against by the town bailiff and were hanged in effigy because\r\nthe principals in the case had made their escape. Diseased houses were\r\nsprinkled with perfumes and aromatic herbs were burned in them in order\r\nto purify them.[841] As always, the dislocation of society and the\r\ndepravation of morals worked havoc in the community. Crimes of violence\r\nwere common.[842]\r\n\r\nLittle by little, however, this picture of misery faded into the\r\nbackground of the queen’s mind and the question of political\r\nexpediency, which was always the lodestar of her policy, became her\r\nprimary consideration.[843] The Catholics plucked up courage as the\r\ncourt progressed[844] and Huguenot suspicion of the queen’s course was\r\nearly aroused. Shortly after the tour of the provinces had begun, and\r\nwhile the court was still at Troyes pending the signature of the treaty\r\nof peace, there was a jar between D’Andelot and the queen mother, who\r\nwould not permit him to choose his own captains and other officers as\r\nwas customarily permitted to colonels. Partially in consequence of\r\nthis affront, and partially to avoid being compromised more with Queen\r\nElizabeth, D’Andelot, the prince of Condé, and the cardinal Châtillon\r\nall remained away from the sessions of the council while the terms\r\nof peace were under consideration, and when the court resumed its\r\nmigration, no one of these attended it.[845] Indeed, after the court\r\nleft Châlons-sur-Marne, so wide was the breach between the prince of\r\nCondé, the admiral and all of that faction, and the court, that the\r\nchancellor L’Hôpital was the only official who continued to treat them\r\nwith deference.[846] The consideration shown Jeanne d’Albret only\r\npartially relieved the suspicions of the Protestants.[847]\r\n\r\nWe find the anxiety of the Protestants over the situation reflected in\r\nthe proceedings of the provincial synod of the Reformed churches of the\r\nregion through which the court had been traveling during this season,\r\nnamely the churches of Champagne, Brie, Picardy, the Ile-de-France, and\r\nthe French Vexin.[848] This synod assembled on April 27, 1564, at La\r\nFerté-sous-Jouarre, and was composed of forty-five ministers. Letters\r\nwere read from many parts of France and abroad, among which was one\r\nfrom Beza bidding the Huguenots to be on their guard as the priests\r\nwere contributing money for the purpose of rooting out the truth. It\r\nwas agreed by the body to reply that the Protestants were suspicious of\r\nthe intentions of the queen mother.[849] In its resolutions the synod\r\ncondemned the policy of the magistrates who cloaked their religious\r\nanimosity under the guise of the law,[850] and complained that the\r\nCatholics were carrying the King about the country in order to show\r\nhim the ruin of their churches.[851] The moderate La Roche even went so\r\nfar as to declare that the Reformed church never could have peace while\r\nthe queen mother governed.\r\n\r\nJustice and historical accuracy, however, require that it be said that\r\nthe Huguenots’ own conduct was sometimes in violation of the privileges\r\ngranted them by the Edict of Amboise. Their iconoclasm toward the\r\nimages and the pictures which the Catholics considered sacred was\r\noutrageous; they failed to confine their worship to authorized places,\r\nso that the magistrates were acting within their rights in so far\r\nrepressing Protestant worship; their provincial synods not infrequently\r\nwere inflammatory political assemblies.[852] On the other hand, the\r\nCatholics wilfully molested the Huguenots, interfering in their\r\ncongregations, and compelling them to pay tithes and other dues for the\r\nsupport of the Catholic poor and even—Castelnau says—to support their\r\nprovincial leagues.[853]\r\n\r\nBut the Huguenots went too far in their suspicion of the government.\r\nBeza, at the synod of La Ferté-sous-Jouarre had been apprehensive of\r\na joint attack of France and Savoy upon Geneva, not knowing that the\r\nFrench aim was to renew the alliance with the Catholic cantons in\r\norder to prevent Spanish ascendency there.[854] Bern and Zurich were\r\nthe pillars of French ascendency in the Alpine country. France counted\r\nupon them more than upon all else to prevent Spanish recruiting, and\r\nto close the Alpine passes to Spain’s army. To this end Bellièvre, the\r\nmarshal Vieilleville, and the bishop of Limoges, who had returned\r\nfrom Madrid, where he was succeeded by St. Sulpice, were sent into\r\nSwitzerland in the early spring of 1564 to penetrate the designs\r\nof Spain, and to promise an early payment of the French debts due\r\nto the cantons in return for their military support in the wars of\r\nHenry II.[855] Bellièvre’s particular mission was to the Grisons. The\r\nposition of the Grisons was a precarious one, for Spain could attack\r\nthem from the Valteline, or starve them by prohibiting the exportation\r\nof grain into the country from Lombardy. By using such threats the\r\nSpanish governor of Milan hoped to compel the adherence of the Grisons\r\nto a treaty which would open to Spanish and imperial arms the great\r\nAlpine routes of the Splügen, the Bernina, and the Stelvio, thus\r\nconnecting the territories of the two branches of the Hapsburg house\r\nand shutting France out from eastern Switzerland. Bellièvre fraternized\r\nwith the popular element, and by May, 1564, had almost completely\r\nneutralized the success of his Spanish rival in spite of Spanish gold.\r\nFortunately for France the Ten Jurisdictions declared in her favor and\r\nthe Grisons, though very Spaniardized, luckily had a French pensioner\r\nas its chief magistrate, the Swiss captain Florin.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the negotiations of the bishop of Limoges and the marshal\r\nVieilleville had progressed so far that the treaty of alliance was all\r\nbut signed. Late in October Bellièvre received from Freiburg the text\r\nof the articles of alliance which the bishop of Limoges and the marshal\r\nVieilleville proposed to submit to the Swiss diet. Encouraged by this\r\nsuccess, he went to Glarus in order to overcome the influence of the\r\nZurich preachers who were outspoken enemies of the French alliance, and\r\nif possible to settle the difference between that state and Schwytz. By\r\ngreat dexterity he prevailed upon the two cantons to accept a uniform\r\ntreaty. But he could not push negotiations to a conclusion until\r\nhearing from his colleagues.\r\n\r\nSpain made a supreme effort to secure the opening of the passages\r\nbetween the Tyrol and the Milanais, but failed because the Grisons\r\npromised France that they would accept the principle of a renewed\r\nalliance, leaving the settlement of details pending, so that although\r\nthe supremacy of France in Switzerland was not absolutely assured, at\r\nleast the adherence of the three leagues to her seemed assured.\r\n\r\nBut the Escurial and the Vatican were leagued to destroy French\r\ninfluence in Switzerland. Spain gave up hope of compelling the cantons\r\nto make a direct alliance with her, but by means of commercial threats\r\nand commercial inducements counted on still keeping the Alpine passes\r\nopen to her arms. Her maxim was, where the grain of Lombardy goes,\r\nthere Spain’s armies may go, too. To neutralize this danger the French\r\nenergetically opposed any renewal of an alliance between the Vatican\r\nand the Swiss cantons. The Grey League, later won by the commercial\r\npromises of Spain, separated from the other two in the end, but its\r\ndefection was not so serious as it might have been, since according to\r\nthe joint constitution the vote of two leagues in matters of foreign\r\npolicy compelled the adherence of the third. But in order further to\r\nstrengthen the hold of France, the French ambassadors had recourse to\r\na sort of referendum in order to secure an approval of the majority of\r\nall the Swiss towns in favor of the French alliance, in addition to the\r\nofficial action of the three leagues. The success of this stroke was\r\ncomplete and the general diet of the three leagues gave its adherence\r\nto the treaty of Freiburg concluded by the bishop of Limoges and the\r\nmarshal Vieilleville on December 7, 1564.[856] The poverty of France,\r\nhowever, seriously endangered the continuance of this alliance. When it\r\nwas concluded, France tried to stave off payment of her debts, which\r\namounted to more than 600,000 livres, yet demanded the execution of the\r\narticles of Freiburg. Glarus, Lucerne, Schwytz, Appenzell, Valais, the\r\nGrisons, Schaffhausen, and Basel bitterly complained, the last also\r\nbecause of the burdens laid upon the importations of her commerce into\r\nFrance through Lyons.\r\n\r\nIn this conflict which France carried on against Spain and the Holy See\r\nin Switzerland, Charles IX was supported by the German Protestants, who\r\nof course were hostile to both houses of Hapsburg, and France may be\r\ncredited with considerable address in smoothing the ruffled feelings\r\nof Basel and Schaffhausen, and softening the Protestant prejudices of\r\nZurich. This is simply another way of saying that the foreign policy\r\nof France in Switzerland was a Protestant policy. Even Bern yielded\r\nand joined the general treaty of alliance instead of insisting upon a\r\nparticular treaty, as she had at first done.[857]\r\n\r\nThe Huguenots, however, suspicious of the impending reaction at home\r\nand misreading the diplomacy of France in Switzerland, grew more and\r\nmore fearful and began to turn their eyes again toward the prince of\r\nCondé as a leader. But fortune and the craft of Catherine had lured\r\nthe prince away from his own; he had become a broken reed, dangerous\r\nto lean upon. In July, 1564, Eleanor de Roye, the brave princess of\r\nCondé, died.[858] The Guises and the queen mother, who were now in\r\nco-operation,[859] at once began to practice to lure Condé away forever\r\nfrom his party, and the former at the same time, in order to make the\r\nalliance between France and Scotland more firm, conceived the idea of\r\nmarrying the prince of Condé to Mary Queen of Scots.[860] As another\r\npossibility the Guises cherished the hope of marrying their niece to\r\nCharles IX and thus recovering the ascendency they had enjoyed under\r\nFrancis II.[861] The corollary of such a plan was the reduction of the\r\nProtestants of France. To these ideas Philip II, was stoutly opposed,\r\nthough he concealed his opposition thereto; Mary was too valuable for\r\nhis projects to be suffered to become a tool of the Guises. Their\r\npurposes were limited to France; his purposes embraced Christendom.[862]\r\n\r\nIn 1575 the Venetian ambassador wrote, à propos of one of the\r\ncourtships of Queen Elizabeth: “Princes are wont to avail themselves\r\nof matrimonial negotiations in many ways.”[863] These words sagely\r\nsummarize the efforts of much of the diplomacy of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. By a singular combination of events and lineages, Mary Stuart\r\nwas necessarily almost the cornerstone of the universal monarchy Philip\r\nII dreamed of forming in Europe; her possession of the Scottish crown,\r\nher claims to England, her relationship with the Guises, united with\r\nthe religion she professed, made the furtherance of her power the most\r\npracticable means to that end. Whether Mary’s future husband were Don\r\nCarlos or the Austrian archduke was a matter of detail in Philip’s\r\nplan—the end remained constant. Mary Stuart was of too much value to\r\nPhilip II’s political designs to risk such a marriage as the Guises\r\ncontemplated.[864] Her hand might be disposed elsewhere with greater\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nThose intense religious convictions of the Spanish King which\r\nmade him believe he was the divinely ordained instrument of the\r\ncounter-Reformation, united with his political purposes and ambitions,\r\nrequired him to keep a watchful eye upon France.[865] The Netherlands,\r\nFrance, Italy, England, Scotland were like so many squares of a vast\r\npolitical chessboard upon which he aimed so to move the pieces he was\r\nin command of as ultimately to seize possession of those countries,\r\nand redeem them from heresy. Mary Stuart was an important personage\r\nin Philip’s purposes. He wanted to put her on the throne of Elizabeth\r\nand thus unite Scotland and England under a common Catholic rule.\r\nFor a time he dreamed of marrying her to his own son, Don Carlos,\r\nuntil Catherine interfered and offered her daughter Marguerite as a\r\nless dangerous alternative to France. The death of Don Carlos,[866]\r\nthe eternal irresolution of the Spanish King, the development of new\r\nevents, continually altered the details of Philip’s purposes, but his\r\nessential aim never varied an iota.[867]\r\n\r\nThe subjugation of France, not in the exact terms of loss of\r\nsovereignty, perhaps, but no less in loss of true national independence\r\nwas a necessary condition of Philip’s purposes. The kingdom of France\r\nwas situated in the very center of those dominions whose consolidation\r\nwas to be the Spanish King’s realization of universal rule. Spain\r\nbordered her on the south; the Netherlands on the north; in the east\r\nlay Franche Comté. Besides these territories which were directly\r\nSpanish, the Catholic cantons of Switzerland and Savoy were morally in\r\nvassalage to Spain. Beyond Franche Comté lay the Catholic Rhinelands,\r\nbound to the other branch of the house of Hapsburg. Beyond Switzerland\r\nand Savoy lay Italy, save Venice entirely, and Rome in part, a group of\r\nSpanish dominions.\r\n\r\nCatherine de Medici combated Philip II both at Madrid and Vienna.\r\nBut by the side of the negative purpose to thwart Philip’s proposed\r\nalliances, Catherine de Medici had purposes of her own of the same\r\nsort. The daughter of a house made rich by banking and which never\r\nlived down the bourgeois tradition of its ancestry in spite of all its\r\nwealth and power, even though popes had come from its house, Catherine\r\nwas fascinated by the thought of marrying Charles IX to the eldest\r\ndaughter of the Hapsburgs, and her favorite son, the future Henry III,\r\nthen known as the duke of Orleans-Anjou, to the Spanish princess Juana,\r\nsister of Philip, hoping to see some of Spain’s numerous dominions pass\r\nto France as part of Juana’s dowry.\r\n\r\nIn the pursuance of this double marriage project, the queen early began\r\nto beset Philip II for a personal interview, and urged her daughter\r\nto persuade the king to the same end, using Pius IV’s cherished idea\r\nof a concert of the great Catholic powers to consider the condition\r\nand needs of Christendom with some adroitness as a screen to her own\r\npersonal purposes.[868]\r\n\r\nMuch of her correspondence with St. Sulpice relates to an interview\r\nwith Philip II for the purpose of arranging these matters, upon which\r\nshe had set her heart, and the time of both the ambassador and the\r\nSpanish King was consumed with repeated interviews none of which was\r\never satisfactory, and all of which were tedious.[869] The natural\r\nreluctance of Philip II to commit himself to any positive course,\r\nunited with the great aversion he felt toward the queen mother because\r\nof her wavering religious policy—for rigid adherence to Catholicism\r\nwas Philip’s one inflexible feature—led the King to follow a course\r\nof procrastination and duplicity for months, during which, however, he\r\nnever evinced any outward sign of impatience; his countenance remained\r\nas imperturbable as that of a Hindu idol, and never by any expression\r\nreflected his thought.[870]\r\n\r\nFoolish pride and undue affection led Catherine even to use the Turk\r\nas a means of pressure upon Spain in order to accomplish this double\r\nmarriage project. In the year 1562 an ambassador of the Sultan passed\r\nthrough France, having come by way of Venice to Lyons, and going\r\nthence via Dijon and Troyes to Paris.[871] Turkey, after crushing\r\nthe revolt of Bajazet,[872] was seeking to avenge the accumulated\r\ngrievances which she had suffered from Austria and Spain, especially\r\nthe latter, for Philip II’s expedition to Oran and his capture of its\r\nfortress, which was regarded as impregnable, had been a bitter blow\r\nto the Porte.[873] Exasperated by Spain, Turkey whose war policy was\r\nguided by the able grand vizier, Mohammed Sokolli, prepared a vast\r\nexpedition to expel her from all points which she occupied in Africa.\r\nBut such a campaign was not possible until Malta, lying midway in the\r\nstraits of the Mediterranean, was overcome.[874] Europe, which still\r\npreserved an acute memory of the protracted siege of Rhodes, looked\r\nforward with dismay to the prospective attack upon Malta, so that\r\nCatherine de Medici’s cordial reception at Dax of another Turkish\r\nambassador—he was a Christian Pole in the employ of the Sultan—in the\r\ncourse of the tour of the provinces was a political act that was daring\r\nto rashness.[875] In order to force Philip II’s hand Catherine even\r\nintimated that Charles IX might marry Queen Elizabeth, although this\r\nproposition was too great a strain upon the credulity of Europe to be\r\ngiven any consideration.[876] Soon after St. Sulpice reached Spain, we\r\nfind Toulouse suggested as the place for the desired interview,[877]\r\nand thereafter for thirty-eight months this conference was one of the\r\ndominant thoughts in Catherine’s mind.[878]\r\n\r\nThe queen mother’s original plan had been to avoid the heat of the\r\nsouth by passing the winter at Moulins, and visiting Languedoc and\r\nGuyenne in the next spring.[879] But the influence of impending\r\nchange impelled her forward in the maze of tournaments, balls, and\r\nmasques.[880] Although she was in “a country full of mountains and\r\nbrigands,”[881] so that she feared “que cette canaille sacageassent\r\nquelques uns de sa cour,” and strengthened Strozzi’s band as a\r\nprecaution, nevertheless Catherine’s resolution seems to have increased\r\nin degree as she moved southward. Probably the fact that the prince\r\nof Condé was in the toils encouraged her; certainly the necessity of\r\nexhibiting something positive that would please Spain, in view of the\r\napproaching interview, actuated her. But apart from her own motives,\r\noutside pressure had been brought to bear upon her to this end, when\r\nat Bar-le-Duc, where the King went to attend the baptism of the infant\r\nchild of Charles III, duke of Lorraine, who had married Charles IX’s\r\nsister, Claudine, in March.[882] Later “when the court came to Lyons\r\ninformation was brought to it that if the King and his advisers should\r\ncontinue to resist the general rising against the Huguenots, it would\r\nbe turned against itself.”[883] In this instance, however, the pressure\r\ncame, not from Spain, but from Pope Pius IV whose agent, the Florentine\r\nLudovico Antinori, was sent to France to urge the extirpation of\r\nCalvinism and to plead the cause of the findings of the Council of\r\nTrent.[884] Catherine obeyed the signs. But as a sudden rupture of the\r\npeace of Amboise would have been attended with dangerous consequences\r\nshe proceeded cautiously.[885]\r\n\r\nThe first[886] definite intimation of the reaction was an edict issued\r\non July 24, prohibiting Calvinist worship within ten leagues of the\r\ncourt, notwithstanding the fact that authorized places of Protestant\r\nworship were affected by it. A fortnight later, on August 4, came a\r\nmore sweeping edict—the so-called Edict of Roussillon[887] which\r\nforbade all persons of whatever religion, quality, or condition to\r\nmolest one another, or to violate or maltreat images, or to lay hands\r\nupon any sacred objects upon pain of death; magistrates were likewise\r\nenjoined to prevent the Huguenots from performing their devotions in\r\nany suspected places, but to confine them to such places as had been\r\nspecified; finally, the Huguenots were forbidden to hold any synods\r\nor other assemblies except in the presence of certain of the King’s\r\nofficers, who were appointed to be present at them.[888] The pretext\r\nof both of these edicts was the trespass upon the terms of Amboise by\r\nthe Protestants, and fear of a Protestant conspiracy. But in reality\r\nthe action of the government constituted a partial yielding to that\r\nCatholic pressure which already had made itself manifest at Nancy.\r\n\r\nThe Edict of Roussillon completely ignored a petition of the Huguenots\r\npresented to the King while at Roussillon, which shows the pernicious\r\nactivity of the local Catholic leagues already. The complaint\r\nspecified that infractions of the Edict of Amboise had been committed\r\nby the Catholics, especially in Burgundy; that Catholic associations\r\neverywhere were being formed against them; that the priests openly\r\nlauded the King of Spain from their pulpits; that their synods were\r\nbroken up by the enemies of their religion.[889]\r\n\r\nAfter a sojourn of a month at Roussillon, the pilgrimage of the court\r\nwas again resumed. At Valence (August 22) Catherine received word\r\nthat Elizabeth of Spain had given birth to still-born twin babes. On\r\nSeptember 24 Avignon was reached, where a stay of two weeks was made\r\nduring which Catherine consulted the famous astrologer Nostradamus.\r\nHyères and Aix were stages on the road to Marseilles[890] (November\r\n3-10), whence it led to Nîmes[891] (December 12), and Montpellier[892]\r\n(December 17), and thence to Agde and Beziers,[893] where progress\r\nfor some time was blocked by heavy snow-falls. The snows irritated\r\nCatherine and to placate her impatience she was shown historical\r\nevidence that both Blanche of Castile and the queen of Charles VII had\r\nonce been snowed-in in these parts for three months.[894] Unlike his\r\nmother, Charles IX enjoyed it, building a snow fort in which he and his\r\npages withstood a siege by some of the gentlemen of the household.[895]\r\n\r\nDuring this enforced sojourn Catherine de Medici received word of the\r\nfamous conflict between the marshal Montmorency, who had been made\r\ngovernor of Paris,[896] when the court started _en tour_, and the\r\ncardinal of Lorraine. On January 8, 1565, the cardinal of Lorraine\r\nsought to enter Paris with a great rout of armed retainers. The marshal\r\ndemanded the disarming of the company, in compliance with a royal\r\n_ordonnance_ of 1564 forbidding the carrying of arquebuses, pistols,\r\nor other firearms,[897] not knowing that the cardinal had a warrant\r\nfrom the queen mother authorizing his men to wear arms if so desired.\r\nThe cardinal haughtily refused to obey, and a fight took place in\r\nthe street near the corner of St. Innocents, in which one man was\r\nkilled.[898]\r\n\r\nThe reactionary policy of the government stimulated the local Catholic\r\nleagues in Languedoc during this winter of 1564-65.[899] The religious\r\nprejudice which these associations manifested was influenced by the\r\nbitter jealousy existing between the Guises and the Montmorencys. From\r\nthe hour of the clash between the cardinal and the marshal, the Guises\r\nplotted to compass the ruin of the house of Montmorency, and sought to\r\nfind support in the Catholic leagues of the southern provinces. The\r\ntolerant policy of the marshal Montmorency and his brother Damville\r\nwas seized upon by the Guises to make them odious.[900] The secular\r\nclergy and still more the Jesuits and Capuchins were very active in\r\nthis work, going from town to town and village to village, urging\r\nCatholics vigorously to defend their faith, and their fiery preaching\r\nmaterially advanced the tendency to union among the provincial\r\nleagues.[901]\r\n\r\nUnder the effective leadership of the sieur de Candalle, the league\r\nof Agen had had an astonishing spread over Guyenne, exhibiting a\r\nstrength of organization and an audacity which foreshadows that of\r\nthe Holy League of 1576, in whose genesis, indeed, it represents an\r\nevolutionary stage. What made the league of Guyenne so peculiarly\r\nformidable, however, was not so much its perfection of organization and\r\nits wide expansion, as the fact that it was organized and had existence\r\nwithout the knowledge or consent of the crown, and in transgression\r\nof the royal authority, which forbade such associations. This highly\r\ndeveloped stage of existence was arrived at by the league of Agen in\r\nAugust, 1564, from which date it may properly be called the league of\r\nGuyenne.[902]\r\n\r\nNaturally the Guises approached Montluc with their plan. While the\r\ncourt was sojourning at Mont-de-Marsan (March 9-24, 1565), waiting\r\nthe arrival of the Spanish queen and the duke of Alva at Bayonne,\r\nan intimation was given to Montluc that a league was in process of\r\nformation in France “wherein were several great persons, princes\r\nand others,” and an agent of the Guises at this time endeavored\r\nto persuade Montluc to join the association.[903] But Montluc was\r\ncautious; he had no great affection for the Guises and, moreover,\r\nleagues and such associations were against the law, which he, as a\r\ncrown officer, was pledged to support. Grammont who was opposed to\r\nMontluc had already complained of his conduct to the queen mother.[904]\r\nBesides, there were private reasons, whose nature will be soon\r\ndeveloped, which made him hesitate. Montluc carried his information to\r\nCatherine de Medici, who, not yet perceiving that the ambition of the\r\nGuises was the chief motive, was not at once seriously alarmed, since\r\nthe anti-Protestant policy of the government made it indifferent now\r\nto such associations. Accordingly, when the court reached Bordeaux\r\n(it arrived there on April 9) and the Huguenots renewed their\r\ncomplaints against Candalle and his associates, the King ignored the\r\npetition, recognizing that many of the nobles were members of the\r\nleague of Guyenne. Instead, he gave the league a quasi-legal status\r\nby proclaiming that the crown would not listen to any more complaints\r\nagainst Candalle and his associates.[905]\r\n\r\nBut the queen mother was genuinely alarmed a few weeks later when\r\nthe real purpose and scope of the proposed league were revealed\r\nto her through an intercepted letter which the duke of Aumale had\r\nwritten on February 27, 1565, to the marquis d’Elbœuf. The duke of\r\nMontpensier, the vicomte de Martigues, Chavigny, who was a Guise\r\nprotégé, D’Angennes, and the bishop of Mans, were named in this letter\r\nas the chiefs of an association, which had for its avowed end the\r\nabasement of the house of Montmorency.[906] Catherine, apprehending\r\nthe consequences certain to result from such an extension of the feud\r\nof the two houses, implored the King, at a large meeting of the council\r\nheld on May 18, 1565, to divulge what had been ascertained—that a\r\nsecret association had been discovered in defiance of the law, having\r\npolitical aims detrimental to the monarchy, and a system of government\r\nfor the levying of men and money without the King’s authority. The\r\ncounselors, with one accord, denied their knowledge or implication,\r\nand protested their devotion to the cause and the law. Catherine was\r\nthoroughly alarmed, and appealed to Montluc for advice. What followed\r\nmay be told in his own words:\r\n\r\n I heard then some whisper of a league that was forming in France,\r\n wherein were several very great persons, both Princes and others,\r\n whom nevertheless I have nothing to do to name, being engaged by\r\n promise to the contrary. I cannot certainly say to what end this\r\n League was contrived; but a certain gentleman named them to me every\r\n one, endeavoring at the same time to persuade me to make one in the\r\n Association, assuring me it was to a good end; but he perceived by my\r\n countenance that it was not a dish for my palate. I presently gave\r\n the Queen private intimation of it; for I could not endure such kind\r\n of doings, who seemed to be very much astonished at it, telling me\r\n it was the first syllable she had ever heard of any such thing; and\r\n commanding me to enquire further into the business, which I did, but\r\n could get nothing more out of my gentleman; for he now lay upon his\r\n guard.\r\n\r\n Her Majesty then was pleased to ask my advice, how she should behave\r\n herself in this business, whereupon I gave her counsel to order it\r\n so that the King himself should say in public that he had heard\r\n of a League that was forming in his Kingdom, which no one could do\r\n without giving him some jealousy and offence; and that therefore he\r\n must require everyone without exception to break off this League,\r\n and that he would make an Association in his Kingdom, of which he\r\n himself would be the Head; for so for some time it was called, though\r\n they afterwards changed the name, and called it the Confederation of\r\n the King. The Queen at the time that I gave her this advice did by\r\n no means approve of it, objecting, that should the King make one, it\r\n was to be feared that others would make another; but I made answer\r\n and said that the King must engage in his own all such as were in\r\n any capacity of doing the contrary, which, however, was a thing that\r\n could not be concealed, and might well enough be provided against. Two\r\n days after, her Majesty being at supper, called me to her and told\r\n me that she had considered better of the affair I had spoke to her\r\n about, and found my counsel to be very good, and that the next day,\r\n without further delay, she would make the King propound the business\r\n to his Council; which she accordingly did, and sent to enquire for me\r\n at my lodging, but I was not within. In the evening she asked me why\r\n I did not come to her, and commanded me not to fail to come the next\r\n day, because there were several great difficulties in the Council, of\r\n which they had not been able to determine. I came according to her\r\n command, and there were several disputes. Monsieur de Nemours made a\r\n very elegant speech, remonstrating “That it would be very convenient\r\n to make a League and Association for the good of the King and his\r\n Kingdom, to the end, that if affairs should so require, every one\r\n with the one and the same will might repair to his Majesty’s person,\r\n to stake their lives and fortunes for his service, and also in case\r\n any one of what religion soever, should offer to invade or assault\r\n them, or raise any commotion in the state, that they might with one\r\n accord unite, and expose their lives in their common defence.” The\r\n Duke of Montpensier was of the same opinion, and several others saying\r\n that they could not choose but so much the more secure the peace of\r\n the Kingdom, when it should be known that all the Nobility were thus\r\n united for the defence of the Crown.\r\n\r\n The Queen then did me the honor to command me to speak; whereupon\r\n I began, and said, “That the League proposed could be no ways\r\n prejudicial to the King, being that it tended to a good end for his\r\n Majesty’s service, the good of his Kingdom, and the peace and security\r\n of his People; but that one which should be formed in private could\r\n produce nothing but disorder and mischief; for the good could not\r\n answer for the evil disposed; and should the cards once be shuffled\r\n betwixt League and League, it would be a hard matter to make of it a\r\n good game; that being the most infallible way to open a door to let\r\n strangers into the kingdom, and to expose all things to spoil and\r\n ruin; but that all of us in general, both Princes and others, ought to\r\n make an Association, which should bear the title of the League, or\r\n the Confederation of the King, and to take a great and solemn oath,\r\n not to decline or swerve from it upon penalty of being declared such\r\n as the oath should import; and that his Majesty having so concluded,\r\n ought to dispatch messengers to all parts of the kingdom, with\r\n commission to take the oaths of such as were not there present, by\r\n which means it would be known, who were willing to live and die in\r\n the service of the king and state. And should anyone be so foolish\r\n or impudent as to offer to take arms, let us all swear to fall upon\r\n them; I warrant your Majesty I will take such order in these parts,\r\n that nothing shall stir to the prejudice of your royal authority.\r\n And in like manner let us engage by the faith we owe to God, that if\r\n any Counter-League shall disclose itself, we will give your Majesty\r\n immediate notice of it; and let your Majesty’s be subscribed by all\r\n the great men of your kingdom. The feast will not be right without\r\n them, and they also are easy to be persuaded to it, and the fittest to\r\n provide against any inconvenience that may happen.”\r\n\r\n This was my proposition, upon which several disputes ensued; but in\r\n the end the King’s Association was concluded on, and it was agreed,\r\n that all the Princes, great Lords, Governors of Provinces, and\r\n Captains of Gens d’armes should renounce all Leagues and Confederacies\r\n whatsoever, as well without as within the Kingdom, excepting that of\r\n the King, and should take the oath upon pain of being declared rebels\r\n to the crown; to which there were also other obligations added, which\r\n I do not remember.... In the end all was past and concluded, and the\r\n Princes began to take the oath, and to sign the articles.[907]\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the crown’s position in these circumstances is evident.\r\nRecognizing its inability to crush these local associations and fearing\r\nlest control of them would pass over wholly to the Guises, the crown\r\ntried to save its power and its dignity by fusing them into a single\r\nconfederation under the King and forbidding the formation of future\r\nassociations without royal consent. But the power of the crown was\r\nnot commensurate with its show of authority. The leagues continued to\r\nmultiply and to remain independent of the crown’s coercion. In the year\r\n1565 the situation is different in degree but not in kind from that\r\nwhich existed in 1576 when the Holy League was formed.\r\n\r\nEven the Spanish affiliations of the Holy League existed potentially\r\nat this time through the treason of Montluc.[908] For the wily Gascon,\r\nwhose character was a combination of daring determination, religious\r\nbigotry and envy, in recommending the measures he did was really taking\r\nsteps to cover up his own tracks. Montluc, despite his professions of\r\nallegiance, was angry at the queen mother, and quite ready to knife her\r\nin the dark. His heart was filled with rebellious envy of Vieilleville,\r\nbecause the latter had been given a marshal’s bâton. Disappointed\r\nin this expectation he asked for the post of colonel-general which\r\nD’Andelot filled.[909] Instead Montluc had to be satisfied with the\r\noffice of governor of Guyenne, which he regarded as ill compensation\r\nof his services.[910] In consequence of these grievances, even before\r\nthe recovery of Havre, Montluc had entered into correspondence with\r\nPhilip II, to whom he represented the necessity of Spanish intervention\r\nin France, on account of the double danger by which France was\r\nthreatened through the purposes of the Protestants and Catherine de\r\nMedici’s toleration of them. The Spanish King at first hesitated,\r\nbut soon availed himself of the opportunity thus afforded, for two\r\nstrings were better than one to his bow. Profound secrecy covered the\r\nnegotiations. Philip’s love of mystery and the delicacy of the matter\r\nled him to conceal the plan even from his ambassador in France, and\r\noperate through Bardaxi, a cousin of a Spanish captain of that name,\r\nwho had been pursued by the Inquisition and had fled to France, where\r\nhe sought service under Montluc in recompense of which he finally was\r\nrehabilitated.[911] Montluc proposed the formation of a league between\r\nthe Pope, the Emperor, the Spanish King, and the leading Catholic\r\nprinces of Germany and Italy to avert a union of the Huguenots with\r\noutside Protestant princes for the overthrow of the Catholic religion\r\nin France.[912] He enlarged upon the moral “benefit” of such a league\r\nto France, now ridden by the Huguenots to the imminent ruin of the\r\nmonarchy, and pointed out to Philip II the peculiar interest he had in\r\ncrushing Calvinism.[913] The plan was for Philip II to kidnap Jeanne\r\nd’Albret who was to be given over to the Inquisition, and to seize\r\npossession of Béarn, and thus accomplish two purposes at once—destroy\r\nthe hearth of Calvinism in France, and establish Spanish power north\r\nof the Pyrenees.[914] Fortunately for France, the French ambassador at\r\nMadrid, St. Sulpice, was informed of the plan, though he did not know\r\nof Montluc’s treason, by a servant of the Spanish queen, and Catherine\r\nde Medici’s energetic steps in the protection of Béarn nipped the\r\nscheme in the bud.[915]\r\n\r\nThis joint plan of Montluc and Philip II for the seizure of Béarn\r\nand the capture of its queen telescoped with another plot against her\r\nto which Philip and Pope Pius IV were parties. On September 28, 1563,\r\na papal bull excommunicated the queen for heresy, and she was cited\r\nbefore the Holy Office for trial.[916] To Catherine’s credit she at\r\nonce took a firm stand in favor of the queen of Navarre.[917]\r\n\r\nIt was not in the nature of Philip II to be daring in daylight.\r\nPrecaution was second nature to him. Lansac’s mission to Madrid\r\nto protest against the action of Pius IV coincided with Montluc’s\r\novertures to the Spanish King. The discovery of part of the plan made\r\nPhilip timid about pushing it at all until a more favorable time at\r\nleast. Accordingly he gave Montluc little encouragement, save offering\r\nhim an asylum in Spain if events should compel him to quit France on\r\naccount of his treasonable correspondence,[918] while to Lansac he\r\nsaid that “what the Pope had done against ‘Madame de Vendôme’ was\r\nvery inopportune and would be remedied.”[919] In a word, Philip II\r\ndissembled his participation in the Pope’s conduct, asserting that\r\nthe procedure had been taken without his knowledge, and that while he\r\ndeplored the queen of Navarre’s apostasy he could not be unmindful of\r\nthe fact that she was kith and kin of the queen of Spain, his wife![920]\r\n\r\nThere probably was a certain amount of spite work in Philip’s\r\nrepudiation of the Pope at this time. One of the important political\r\nissues raised at the Council of Trent was the question of precedence\r\nbetween the ambassadors of France and Spain. Lansac, Charles IX’s\r\nambassador to the Council, claimed the honor of going before the\r\ncount of Lara, Spain’s representative, at which Philip was “picqué\r\noultre mesure.”[921] The papal party in vain implored Lansac to yield.\r\nLansac replied that “la France ne pouvait renoncer aux droits qui lui\r\navaient été reconnus dans tous les précédents conciles, et que, plutôt\r\nque de laisser rien innover sur ce point, ‘j’étais résolu, selon le\r\ncommandement de mon maître, après avoir protesté de nullité de ce\r\nconcile, de m’en aller incontinent avec tous les prélats de notre\r\nnation, sans entrer dans aucune dispute ne composition.’”[922] Philip\r\nII refrained from making any observation to France upon the disputed\r\npoint[923] pending the decision of the Pope.[924] But such a course\r\nwas impossible. The contest over the question became the absorbing\r\ntopic of conversation at Rome.[925] The Pope was between Scylla and\r\nCharybdis.[926] Spain claimed precedence for Philip II through the\r\ncrown of Castile—“chose peu véritable”—and argued that the services\r\nof Philip II to the church justified her pretension; to which France\r\nrejoined that her king was historically first son of the church, the\r\nMost Christian King, who “had bled and suffered for the preservation of\r\nthe Catholic religion in his kingdom, for which he had combated to the\r\nhazarding of his entire state.”[927] Finally being compelled to decide,\r\nPius IV made a choice in favor of France, to the immense chagrin of\r\nPhilip II who actually fell sick of the humiliation and recalled his\r\nambassador Vargas from Rome as a sign of his displeasure.[928]\r\n\r\nThe catalogue of Spain’s grievances against France, besides the\r\nquestion of religion, the dispute over precedence, and France’s refusal\r\nto accept the findings of Trent which Philip II had recognized[929]\r\nincluded still another complaint. This was the border difficulty\r\nbetween the Spanish provinces of Artois and Luxembourg, and France.\r\nIt was a complex question, partly religious, partly political, partly\r\ncommercial. Like the Huguenot rebellion, the growing insurrection in\r\nthe Low Countries was of a double nature—religious and political.\r\nEach side looked to the other for sympathy and support and neither was\r\ndisappointed. The Huguenots retaliated for the assistance afforded the\r\ngovernment of France by Spain during the first civil war by aiding the\r\nrevolt of the Netherlands. This intimate connection of events on each\r\nside of the line is an important fact to be observed.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1563, as Granvella had divined,[930] that the intrigues\r\nof the French Protestants in Flanders became a matter of serious\r\napprehension. Valenciennes was the most aggressive city of the religion\r\nin Flanders, and Margaret of Parma actually was afraid of Montigny\r\ndoing as Maligny had done at Havre. Already the prince of Orange was\r\nthe recognized leader of those who sympathized with the Huguenots.\r\nTo this class England’s support of the prince of Condé, and above\r\nall, the assassination of the duke of Guise, came as a real stimulus.\r\nValenciennes, Tournay, Antwerp, even Brussels were stirred. In May,\r\n1563, the demonstrations of the Calvinists at Valenciennes and Tournay\r\nbecame so bold that it required six companies of infantry to keep\r\nthem overawed. But this measure, instead of accomplishing the result\r\nexpected, aggravated the situation, for the marquis de Berghes, the\r\ncommander, was so ostracized by the nobles, that he lost courage.\r\nPhilip II grew alarmed and wrote to his sister on June 13, 1563, that\r\nthe example of France counseled most drastic suppression. In reply\r\nthe regent and the cardinal Granvella implored Philip to come to the\r\nNetherlands, but he pleaded ignorance of the language and poverty as\r\nexcuse. Meanwhile the Orange party practiced so successfully with the\r\nduchess of Parma that she inclined toward conciliation instead of\r\ncoercion. This threw the regent and De Berghes into alignment, who\r\nproposed to convoke the States-General to remedy the evils—a programme\r\nwhich the nobles enthusiastically advocated.\r\n\r\nThe similarity between the Flemish movement and the programme of the\r\npolitical Huguenots in France is very close.[931] With the design of\r\nsuppressing heresy in its two most active centers, Granvella proposed\r\nto imitate the method used at Paris, of exacting a profession of faith\r\ntogether with a pledge to observe the laws, of all citizens who wished\r\nto stay in the city. Recalcitrants were to be disarmed, compelled to\r\nsell their property, one-third of the proceeds of which was to be\r\nconfiscated for the support of the soldiers and municipal expenses, and\r\nthe culprits were then to be banished from the country. This drastic\r\npolicy called forth a mingled protest and threat from the prince of\r\nOrange, whose wealth and German connections, aside from other qualities\r\nhe possessed, gave him great influence. The government begged for money\r\nand troops, “como la liga va cresciendo.”[932] Orange’s tactics were\r\nto persuade the provincial estates to refuse to vote subsidies or to\r\nthrow the weight of the finances upon the church much after the manner\r\nof things done at Pontoise. This he began to do in Brabant where the\r\nindefinite postponement of a grant of money provoked mutiny among\r\nthe soldiers. In September De Berghes went out from office, having\r\ndistinguished himself by not putting a single heretic to death. The\r\nchange was immediately followed by the burning alive of a Protestant\r\npreacher and the protestations of the quartet, Orange, Hoorne, Egmont,\r\nand Montigny, became bolder.[933] Finally the nobles of Flanders\r\nresolved to protest to the King of Spain. Philip II, always hesitating\r\nand undecided, did not respond. To a petition which was sent him\r\ndemanding the recall of the cardinal, he replied by a flat refusal. The\r\nnobles showed their offense by absenting themselves from the Council\r\nof State and used their influence to detach the regent from Granvella.\r\nAt last, after months of negotiation, Philip II yielded. Granvella\r\nretired to his splendid palace at Besançon in Franche Comté and the\r\nnobles resumed their seats in the council. But the four were irritated\r\nat Philip II’s delay in responding to their demands for reform. It was\r\nevident, moreover, by November, 1563, that something like a common\r\npurpose actuated the chief provinces—Flanders, Artois, Holland,\r\nZealand, and Utrecht.[934]\r\n\r\nThe Calvinists were especially numerous in the Walloon provinces,\r\nand preachers from Geneva and England were active among them. The\r\ngovernment undertook to restrain their assemblies, and the conflict\r\nbroke out. This conflict, it is important to remark, did not turn\r\nupon the question of religion in and of itself, but upon the manner\r\nof treating the heretics. Philip wanted to apply the edicts of his\r\nfather, which required the death penalty for heresy; but the government\r\nand Spanish officials in the Low Countries, Catholics though they were,\r\nwere opposed to so severe a penalty and would rather have treated\r\nthose offending as criminals than as heretics. But with Philip the\r\nextirpation of heresy was a question of conscience.\r\n\r\nValenciennes still remained the most prominent place of\r\ndisaffection,[935] but Brussels was much infected.[936] But more\r\nformidable than local spirit was the marked tendency toward a union\r\nof the provinces[937] and the growing interest of the Huguenots in\r\nthe Dutch and Flemish cause,[938] so much so that Cardinal Granvella\r\nstrongly hinted at Spanish pressure being forcibly exerted upon France\r\nfor the reduction of the Huguenots.[939] The cardinal hoped to see\r\nCharles IX and his mother more docile in receiving the advice of Spain\r\nsince the withdrawal of Chantonnay, who was made Philip II’s ambassador\r\nat Vienna. But the theft of Alava’s cipher by the Huguenots threw him\r\ninto despair.[940] The reciprocal connection between politics and\r\nreligion in France and the Low Countries made the Spanish government\r\nwatch the movement of events in France with vigilance.[941] So acute\r\nwas the situation owing to Huguenot sympathy with the cause of\r\ninsurrection across the border,[942] that although Granvella ridiculed\r\nthe wild rumor that Montgomery was coming to Flanders, he nevertheless\r\napprehended the possibility of a rupture with France and was relieved\r\nto know that precautions had been taken against any chance enterprise\r\nof the Huguenots along the edge of Artois and Hainault.[943]\r\n\r\nMargaret of Parma and the nobles sent ambassadors to Spain to ask\r\nconcession on two points: (1) that the provinces be governed by\r\nnative officials; (2) that the punishment of heresy be moderated. The\r\nKing hesitated long. It was not until October 17, 1565, that he gave\r\ndecisive pronouncement in dispatches issued from Segovia. In them he\r\nordered the maintenance of the Inquisition, the enforcement of the\r\nedicts, and the impoverishment of those who resisted. In a word, Philip\r\nII would not yield. The discontent against the administration of the\r\nKing of Spain now turned against the King himself. William of Orange\r\nused the notable words, “We are witnessing the beginning of a great\r\ntragedy.”\r\n\r\nIn the face of the growing resistance the duke of Alva strongly advised\r\nPhilip II to convert the towns into fortresses.[944] For the Flemish\r\ncities were, as yet, commercial groups, not fortified burgs. With the\r\npossible exception of Gravelines, no one of them was capable of making\r\na sustained defense.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion happened to coincide with the English occupation\r\nof Havre-de-Grace and the possible return of Calais to England in\r\nreturn therefor. Such a contingency could but be viewed with anxiety\r\nby Spain,[945] and this fact, coupled with the uncertainty of\r\ndevelopments in France induced Philip to follow out Alva’s suggestion\r\nby strengthening Gravelines. France at once became alarmed over Calais\r\nand protested in the same breath against the building of fortifications\r\nat Gravelines and the duty upon her wines.[946] In retaliation the\r\nFrench government also strengthened the garrisons on the edge of\r\nPicardy, under the direction of the prince of Condé (who was governor\r\nof the province), to the immense indignation of Spain.[947] The\r\nSpanish erections around Gravelines reacted also upon the state of\r\nthings in Flanders. For new and heavier taxation was the indispensable\r\npoint of departure for carrying out such measures, “unless one were\r\nwilling to see everything said upon the subject vanish in smoke.”\r\nThe sole effective remedy for the state of things prevailing in the\r\nFlemish provinces was, of course, to reorganize the finances and the\r\nadministration of justice in accordance with the demands made by the\r\nnobles. But instead of attempting to do this, the government aimed to\r\nweaken the opposition by dividing the leaders, and the long silence of\r\nPhilip II covered an attempt to draw away Egmont, who was regarded as\r\nthe ringleader of the Flemish nobles at this time.[948] The Spanish\r\ngovernment dreaded to summon the estates, as Orange insisted should be\r\ndone, for fear of things in Brabant and the other provinces going the\r\nroad of things in France under like conditions.[949]\r\n\r\nIn order, therefore, to provide for funds without asking the estates to\r\nvote subsidies, over which there was sure to be a conflict, the Spanish\r\ngovernment in the Netherlands undertook to raise the needed money\r\nby tariffs. The cloth trade of England and the wine trade of France\r\nwere the two commodities so taxed. In 1563 a duty was laid on French\r\nwine.[950] In the case of England, the excuse given for the high duty\r\nplaced on imported cloth was precaution against the plague.[951] France\r\nat once protested against the tariff and threatened to retaliate by\r\ntaxing the herring and cod trade, though the Spanish ambassador at\r\nParis represented that such action would entirely destroy the wine\r\ntrade and would compel reprisal.[952]\r\n\r\nFlemish merchants were doubly alarmed at the state of things, for\r\nEngland, too, threatened reprisal by removing the cloth market from\r\nAntwerp to Embden and imposing tonnage duties on merchant ships of\r\nFlanders driven by stress of weather into English ports for safety\r\nduring storm.[953] But the government in Flanders was obdurate.\r\nGranvella declared England’s threat to remove the staple to Embden\r\nto be “puerile rhodomontade.” He believed that not only would the\r\nprohibition against the import of English cloth compel Elizabeth\r\nto redress the grievances of Spanish subjects against England, but\r\nthat it might even make the English government more lenient toward\r\nthe Catholic religion. Furthermore, he argued, the tax would operate\r\nlike a protective tariff to stimulate the manufacture of cloth in\r\nthe Low Countries. “If not a single bolt of English cloth ever comes\r\ninto Flanders again,” he wrote “it will be to the permanent profit\r\nof the Pays-Bas. We saw this clearly last year during the plague\r\nwhen the prohibition having temporarily suspended the importation of\r\nthis kind of goods, there was manufactured in the single county of\r\nFlanders 60,000 pieces of cloth, or more than the sum total of the\r\nthree preceding years.”[954] In the case of French wines the Flemish\r\ngovernment even established a maximum law for their sale which cut the\r\nthroat of French merchants worse than ever.[955] The French government\r\ncarried the action of the Flemish government up to Madrid, where for\r\nmonths the duty on wine and the buttresses of Gravelines were matters\r\nof repeated interviews between St. Sulpice and the King, and were still\r\nunsettled questions at the time of the conference at Bayonne.[956]\r\nMeanwhile the conflict of the Flemish reform party became more acute\r\nbecause it became complicated with the question of religion.\r\n\r\nIn the light of all these circumstances, it is no wonder that Philip II\r\nhesitated long before giving his consent to an interview with Catherine\r\nde Medici.[957] Even then he imposed a number of conditions and\r\nregulations. He would not go in person to Bayonne—the place appointed;\r\nhis wife was to be accompanied by the duke of Alva; display was to\r\nbe avoided by either side both for motives of economy and to prevent\r\nhaving undue political significance attached to an interview which\r\nwas to be understood to be purely personal. Philip II’s most striking\r\nregulations, however, were those which had to do with the French\r\n_entourage_. No one in the least tainted with heresy was to accompany\r\nthe court. The queen of Navarre, whom the Spanish King carefully\r\nalluded to as “Madame de Vendôme,” the prince of Condé, the admiral,\r\nand the cardinal Châtillon were specifically named with abhorrence. The\r\nqueen mother acquiesced in this prohibition, save in the case of the\r\nprince of Condé, protesting that, on account of his rank, it would give\r\ngreat offense to forbid his presence, as well as create belief among\r\nthe Huguenots that the meeting contemplated something disadvantageous\r\nto them. History has shown that Catherine’s instincts were perfectly\r\nright in this particular; since after the massacre of St. Bartholomew\r\nthe Huguenots—indeed almost the whole Protestant world—jumped to the\r\nconclusion that that disaster was preconcerted at Bayonne. In vain St.\r\nSulpice argued political expediency, saying France and Spain must not\r\nbe judged alike, and that “experience had proved that the way of arms\r\nhad resulted in more dangers than profit to France.” Philip II’s answer\r\nwas metallically hard; he would not consent to the presence either of\r\nJeanne d’Albret or the prince of Condé at Bayonne, because it would be\r\na reproach to him and to Spain for his wife to have had converse with a\r\nheretic.[958]\r\n\r\nThe last stage of Charles IX’s long tour of the provinces was from\r\nBordeaux[959] to Bayonne[960] where the French court arrived on May\r\n22, 1565. But that indolence of spirit which is so much associated\r\nwith Spanish character seems as early as the sixteenth century to have\r\nbecome habitual,[961] so that the Spanish queen was forced to travel in\r\nthe heat (six soldiers of Strozzi’s band died with their armor on from\r\nheat prostration), which aggravated the plague prevailing in certain\r\nparts.[962]\r\n\r\nIn conferences of state, especially international conferences, things\r\nof importance are confined within four walls. The sixteenth century\r\nwas _par excellence_ the age of closet politics. The world upon the\r\noutside saw only the fêtes[963] that marked the interview at Bayonne.\r\nBut these festivities were no more than the flecks or wreaths of\r\nglittering foam that float upon the bosom of the water for an instant\r\nand then are gone. The real business at Bayonne was politics. But the\r\ngreat importance for three hundred years[964] attributed to this famous\r\ninterview is today proved to have had slight foundation in fact. The\r\nlight of recent research has dissipated the traditional belief that\r\nPhilip II and Catherine de Medici planned the massacre of the French\r\nProtestants at Bayonne, and finally consummated it on St. Bartholomew’s\r\nDay.[965] The truth is that not what was contemplated but _what was\r\nimagined was contemplated_ at Bayonne became the important historical\r\ninfluence of the future. An assumed fact came to have all the force\r\nof reality. The principals in this unfortunate conference, in point\r\nof truth, were far apart from one another. Philip II’s interests were\r\nwholly political, and personalities were merely incidental to his main\r\npurpose. On the other hand, the queen mother’s interests were chiefly\r\npersonal, being centered in plans to achieve brilliant marriage\r\nalliances for her children, for whose sake she ruinously compromised\r\nherself and France.\r\n\r\nIf Catherine had been less vain and less foolishly affectionate, she\r\nwould have striven harder for the solution of things more vital to\r\nFrance. It is true she was far from ignoring these issues entirely, but\r\nshe weakened the cause of France in respect to them by subordinating\r\nthese to her main purpose, so that she awakened the greater suspicion\r\nof Spain by her attempts to avoid answering in those matters of most\r\nconcern to Philip II and by her continual harping upon the things that\r\nwere nearest to her heart, but not of most moment either to France or\r\nto Spain. When the duke of Alva drove her into a corner and compelled\r\nher to answer the questions he put to her concerning greater politics,\r\nCatherine’s replies were fatal to her aspirations. What were these\r\nmatters?\r\n\r\nAlva’s instructions were strict. He was to demand the expulsion of the\r\nHuguenot ministers from France within thirty days; the interdiction\r\nof Protestant worship; acceptance of the decrees of the Council of\r\nTrent; profession of the Catholic religion by all office holders.[966]\r\nThis policy of suppression and compulsion outlined by his sovereign\r\nwas wholly in keeping with his, the duke’s, own judgment. But with\r\ngreater penetration and less hesitation than Philip II, Alva recognized\r\nclearly the intimate connection between the politics of Flanders and\r\nthe politics of France, and favored the adoption of a parallel line\r\nof conduct at once in the Low Countries. He was convinced that France\r\nwas incapable of managing her own affairs and was a menace to other\r\nstates, politically and religiously.[967] The means of repression\r\nwhich Spain had often urged had not produced the results desired:\r\nthey had only delayed the total ruin of the nation. Suggestion and\r\ninsinuation must be replaced by a more drastic policy. Assassination\r\nwas a recognized, perhaps a quasi-legitimate political recourse in the\r\neyes of the men of the sixteenth century. The old generation of French\r\nCatholics upon whom Spain could rely, the cardinal de Tournon, the\r\nduke of Guise, the marshal St. André, had passed away—one of them\r\nassassinated at the hands of a Huguenot. Tavannes and Vieilleville\r\nwere reluctant to sacrifice country to religion, especially when a\r\nrival nation would profit thereby. The constable was the only old-time\r\nfigure of prominence remaining, and he could not be relied on since the\r\nconflict between the marshal Montmorency and the cardinal of Lorraine,\r\nfor he favored the side of his nephews and so was believed to be not\r\nfar distant from the party of the admiral.[968] Power had fallen into\r\nthe hands of the Huguenots, whose leaders now excelled in personal\r\nforce. “The shortest, the most expeditious way, is to behead Condé, the\r\nadmiral, D’Andelot, La Rochefoucauld, and Grammont,” Alva told the duke\r\nof Montpensier[969] and Montluc, the two most earnest French converts\r\nto this policy.[970]\r\n\r\nBut it was yet a far cry from this cool advocacy of assassination of\r\nthe Protestant leaders to the wholesale slaughter of August 24, 1572.\r\nThere is really no positive connection between the conference of\r\nBayonne and the massacre of St. Bartholomew.[971] The slaughter of the\r\nFrench Protestants _as a sect_ was never advocated by any prince in\r\nEurope, not even Philip II. There is no evidence at the Vatican of any\r\nCatholic or papal league for the extirpation of the Protestants. Such\r\na solution of the religious problem was not contemplated, save by one\r\nperson in Europe at this time—Pope Pius V. It is this pontiff who has\r\nthe sinister distinction of having advocated general destruction of the\r\nProtestants, rather than a discriminating assassination of the Huguenot\r\nleaders.[972] The most radical action touching the Huguenots at large,\r\nit may safely be said, that was regarded practicable in 1564-65 was\r\nto forbid and prevent future conversion,[973] or else the wholesale\r\nexile of the Huguenots from the realm.[974] The alternative of total\r\ndestruction was not contemplated anywhere in Europe or at any time,\r\nexcept in the single case mentioned.\r\n\r\nNo such crime as the massacre of the Huguenots was planned at Bayonne,\r\nnor perpetrated as the result of that conference. The principals in the\r\ncase were too far apart in intention and conviction for so gigantic\r\na programme. The paramount purpose of the queen mother was to marry\r\nCharles IX to the elder daughter of the Emperor, Margaret of Valois to\r\nDon Carlos, and the duke of Orleans (the future Henry III) to Donna\r\nJuana, Philip II’s sister. But Alva was crafty. By a series of adroit\r\nquestions which tantalized her hopes and preyed upon her fears, he\r\ncompelled Catherine de Medici to commit herself upon the very political\r\nissues which she wished to avoid discussing, until she was hopelessly\r\ncompromised. In vain she doubled like a fox pursued by the hounds and\r\ntried to throw the duke off upon a false scent.\r\n\r\n“France must be cleared of this vicious sect,” said Alva. In order\r\nto avoid replying, Catherine attempted, by a question, to turn the\r\nconversation to the subject of a universal league, whether it should be\r\nagainst the Turk or against the heretic. Alva was not thrown off. The\r\nqueen resorted to sarcasm.\r\n\r\n“Since you understand the evil from which France is suffering so well,”\r\nshe said, “tell me the remedy.”\r\n\r\nAlva sidestepped the direct shot, by suavely rejoining:\r\n\r\n“Madame, who knows better than yourself?”\r\n\r\n“The King, your master,” said Catherine ironically, “knows better than\r\nI everything that passes in France. What means would he employ to\r\novercome the rebellious Protestants?”\r\n\r\nAlva resorted to the Socratic method, hoping to involve the queen in\r\nthe toils of argument.\r\n\r\n“Has the religion gained or lost since the peace of Amboise?” he\r\ninquired insidiously.\r\n\r\n“It has gained,” replied she.\r\n\r\nThe answer, in Spain’s eyes, was a condemnation of the policy of\r\nFrance; it was a thorn in the road of the queen’s ambitious hopes\r\nof marriage alliance. In her exasperation, Catherine upbraided her\r\ndaughter for out-Spaniarding the Spaniard.\r\n\r\n“I am a Spaniard, I admit,” said Elizabeth. “ It is my duty.”[975]\r\n\r\nCatherine broached anew the possibility of Philip II consenting to have\r\nhis sister marry her Benjamin—Henry duke of Orleans—and conferring\r\nArtois as dowry upon the pair.\r\n\r\n“The king would never consent to sacrifice one of his provinces,” said\r\nAlva brusquely.\r\n\r\n“But to give a Spanish province to the duke of Orleans,” argued the\r\nqueen mother, blinded by maternal affection, “would be the same then as\r\ngiving it to his own brother.”\r\n\r\nAlva taxed the queen with maintaining a heretic, L’Hôpital, in the\r\nchancellorship, and of opposing the Tridentine decrees. Catherine\r\nemphatically denied the first charge, although her daughter again\r\nsupported Alva’s indictment by declaring that even during the life of\r\nher father, L’Hôpital had passed for a Huguenot; as to the second,\r\nshe said the crown of France objected to the political application\r\nof certain findings of the Council of Trent, which she hoped to have\r\nadjusted. Alva saw the vulnerable point in her reply and inquired if\r\nshe aimed to call another assembly like the Colloquy of Poissy.\r\n\r\n“I recognize the danger of such assemblies,” said Catherine, “but the\r\nking, my son, is strong enough to compel discussion only of those\r\nsubjects which he may designate.”\r\n\r\n“Was it so at Poissy?” sneered Alva.\r\n\r\nThe queen’s reply was a tirade against the cardinal of Lorraine, whom\r\nshe blamed for the failure of the colloquy.\r\n\r\nIn the end there _was_ a promise given by the queen mother at Bayonne.\r\nBut it was verbal, not written, and so governed by circumstances that\r\nthe edge of Spain’s intentions was dulled. Compromising the agreement\r\ncertainly was; convicting it is not, for, aside from the fact that\r\nits fulfilment was dependent upon an impossible condition of things,\r\nCatherine never permitted herself to express in writing what the terms\r\nof this promise were. Our knowledge of it is dependent upon Alva’s\r\nletters of June 15 and July 4; upon Philip II’s construction of it in\r\na letter addressed by him to the cardinal Pacheco[976] on August 24,\r\n1565, and the dispatch of the Venetian ambassador Suriano, who was\r\nwith the French queen, to the senate on July 22, supplemented by what\r\ninformation St. Sulpice picked up during the last days of his mission\r\nin Spain.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the careful reading of these documents that the real\r\ntriumph at Bayonne was scored by the papacy; that Spain won a sterile\r\nvictory, and France met an indecisive defeat. Spain and France, being\r\nunable to carry their own purpose through as each desired, compromised\r\non a course which was an intermediate plane of agreement to them, but\r\nwhich, _according to the letter_, was a supreme triumph for Rome, and\r\nwould have been a complete victory for Rome _if the terms had ever been\r\nexecuted_. The man of the hour was the cardinal Santa Croce, nuncio in\r\nFrance. His services are thus reported by the Venetian ambassador in\r\nFrance on July 2:\r\n\r\n On the eve of departure, the queen, perceiving the discontent of the\r\n duke of Alva, summoned the nuncio, who was not far away, to Bayonne,\r\n in order to have him at hand. It is he who has found a solution; he\r\n has satisfied both parties. I shall be able to inform you shortly as\r\n to the nature of his solution.[977]\r\n\r\nThree weeks later (July 22) the promised word was sent to Venice in\r\nthe form of a cipher dispatch,[978] the information in which had been\r\ncommunicated to him in strictest secrecy.[979] This intensely important\r\ndocument reads as follows:\r\n\r\n Now that I have received positive information, I shall tell everything\r\n to your Signory that has happened. Since his arrival, the duke of Alva\r\n has not ceased to urge the queen to give his master a manifestation of\r\n her good will toward the cause of religion by some manifest act, and\r\n he had urged her to cause the decisions of the Council of Trent to be\r\n observed throughout the whole realm of France, for which his Catholic\r\n majesty would show his satisfaction. The queen had yielded readily\r\n to this proposition and had told him that she was very inclined to\r\n convene an assembly of prelates, of theologians, and savants, to\r\n examine the decisions made at Trent, _without occupying themselves\r\n with doctrine_, but confining themselves to the reform of abuses. The\r\n duke had found this offer strange and had not concealed his discontent\r\n over it. According to him, this was to oppose a council to a council,\r\n which would be the worst of results and mightily displease the king\r\n his master. Since he urged the necessity of this measure, before\r\n passing to any other consideration, and was so obdurate, the queen,\r\n being very pained to see him depart so unsatisfied, and things being\r\n so desperate, notified the nuncio, who was not lodged at Bayonne\r\n like all the ambassadors, and ordered the _mareschal de logis_ of\r\n the palace to prepare accommodation for him and to have him come\r\n immediately. He came at once and being informed by the queen, went to\r\n find the duke, but was very badly received by him. The duke blamed\r\n and reproached him for not remaining firm in his opinion. The queen\r\n holding to the idea of this assembly of prelates and theologians, and\r\n the duke opposing it, the nuncio found another expedient which seemed\r\n to give satisfaction to all. He broached it to the queen, and with\r\n her consent communicated it to the duke. This remedy, at the twelfth\r\n hour, was very opportune. It is this: This assembly shall be held:\r\n but under certain conditions. The first is that the persons chosen to\r\n participate in it shall be of such influence as to be able to demand\r\n that no Huguenot shall sit in it; secondly, the assembly must conform\r\n to that which the queen had at first proposed; that is to say, all\r\n disputes over dogma and doctrine shall be forbidden. The queen, having\r\n accepted this, authorized the nuncio to communicate her consent to the\r\n duke, who showed himself satisfied. Both of them then came together\r\n to find the queen again, and on the next day, in the presence of the\r\n queen of Spain, the cardinal Bourbon, the marshal Bourdillon, and the\r\n leading nobles, the whole was confirmed.\r\n\r\n Great benefit can come from this: by eliminating everything that\r\n pertains to dogma, and avoiding doctrinal difficulties, all the\r\n other resolutions which are of less importance will be strengthened,\r\n especially as the Huguenots, the only ones who can give trouble will\r\n be excluded. There is no doubt about both the king and the queen being\r\n disposed to the Catholic religion, since they have given proofs of\r\n it. I am, moreover, assured by what the queen has said, that there\r\n is no intention to touch any of the privileges of the Holy See, nor,\r\n per contra, any of the concessions made by the popes to the kings who\r\n were predecessors of the king now reigning. The execution of this\r\n convention thus arranged is not to take place until the return of the\r\n king to Paris.\r\n\r\nThe King of Spain, in the letter cited to Cardinal Pacheco, expressed\r\nhis contentment with this agreement,[980] not perceiving that the\r\napplication of it was capable of a great amount of flexibility. In his\r\nblindness he thought that the nuncio had broken the loaf so as to give\r\nthe greater portion to Spain; while in reality the greater part was in\r\nthe hands of the Pope, Philip II having actually but the difference\r\nbetween a fragment and no bread. In fine, no plot was entered into\r\nat Bayonne; no crime was ever committed in pursuance of an agreement\r\narranged there. The “plot” agreed upon at Bayonne between Catherine\r\nde Medici and Philip II of Spain consisted of an ambiguous promise,\r\nthe fulfilment of which was dependent upon an impossible condition of\r\nthings.[981]\r\n\r\nThe affair of Bayonne was not a crime; it was a colossal blunder. The\r\ndestruction of the ambitious marriage expectations of the Valois was\r\nthe least loss. The irreparable thing was that France forfeited the\r\nconfidence of her Protestant subjects. The secrecy that enveloped\r\nthe conference made the Huguenots apprehensive of the worst. They\r\nbelieved that a Franco-Spanish alliance was made at Bayonne for their\r\noverwhelming; and the second civil war was the outcome of their\r\nmisgivings.[982] And when finally, _for other reasons_, the massacre\r\nof St. Bartholomew befell them, not merely Protestant France but\r\nProtestant Europe was convinced that the false hypothesis had been\r\ndemonstrated. The count Hector la Ferrière admirably summarizes the\r\nsituation:\r\n\r\n To maintain and loyally to adhere to the edict of pacification; to\r\n open to the daring sailors of France the Indies and America, which\r\n Spain and Portugal were endeavoring to close to them; and finally to\r\n rally Catholics and Protestants under the same banner against the\r\n foreigner—this was the only true French policy. The Spaniard at this\r\n time was the enemy of France. She encountered him everywhere in her\r\n path; at Rome, at Vienna, at the Council of Trent he disputed her\r\n precedence; in Switzerland by gold and by the menaces of his agents he\r\n interfered with the renewals of the French treaties with the Catholic\r\n cantons; at the very time when Catherine and Elizabeth of Valois were\r\n exchanging false promises of alliance and friendship, Menendez was\r\n sailing for Florida, bearing orders for the massacre of all the French\r\n found there.[983]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE TOUR OF THE PROVINCES (_Continued_). THE INFLUENCE OF THE REVOLT OF\r\nTHE NETHERLANDS UPON FRANCE. THE AFFAIR OF MEAUX\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the field of Philip II’s empty victory the court resumed its\r\npilgrimage, crossing the Loire and traversing Guyenne which was “in\r\ngood repose,” visiting Angoulême, Cognac, Saintes, La Rochelle, and\r\nNiort _en route_ to Nantes. The country was the veritable dominion\r\nof Calvinism in France, but as yet the Huguenots let their hopes\r\nbelie their fears.[984] The progress through the western provinces\r\nwas purposely slow, for Catherine still hoped against hope that\r\nFourquevaux, who had succeeded St. Sulpice at the Spanish court,\r\nmight persuade Philip II to think more favorably of her matrimonial\r\nschemes,[985] until finally, late in December, the bitter truth came\r\nout; only the younger daughter of the Hapsburgs might marry a Valois,\r\neven though he was king of France. The queen mother had been weighed\r\nin the balance by Catholic-Hapsburg Europe and had been found wanting.\r\nThen it was that Catherine turned her eyes toward eastern Europe in the\r\nhope of finding in Poland a recompense for the fondled and despicable\r\nHenry of Valois. Strange are the vicissitudes of history! The effect\r\nof Philip II’s resolution was to put a mountebank on the throne of\r\nPoland and cast Marguerite of Valois into the arms of the son of Jeanne\r\nd’Albret.[986]\r\n\r\nLong before this time, however, Spain had begun to be impatient for\r\nthe fulfilment of the compact of Bayonne. But procrastination was\r\nCatherine’s trump suit. She averred that the plague was too prevalent\r\nto make it safe for the court to return to Paris until winter,[987] and\r\nwhen the cold weather diminished the danger from that source, pleaded\r\nthe poverty and famine of the realm as an excuse.[988] It was an excuse\r\nthe validity of which was everywhere manifest. France truly had been in\r\nthe dire pangs of hunger and intense cold during the celebrated winter\r\nof 1564-65.[989] Claude Haton, the priest-historian of Provins, who\r\nwas a close observer of meteorological phenomena has given a graphic\r\ndescription of this season.\r\n\r\n The winter at its commencement in November [he says] was very mild\r\n and was so until December 20, the vigil of St. Thomas the apostle,\r\n without either cold or frost in the mornings. The rain was so warm\r\n that it was thought that the winter would be mild and open, but on\r\n the vigil of St. Thomas there came a great cold, accompanied in the\r\n morning by a cold rain, which by midday turned into snow, and which\r\n fell all the rest of the day in so great abundance that the earth,\r\n which was very wet, was covered on the morrow to the depth of a foot,\r\n king’s measure, and more, with snow. With this snow came a northeast\r\n wind, which froze everything under a coating of thick ice. This cold\r\n continued down to the last day of December. The ice was so thick that\r\n a man could cross the river without breaking through. The snow lay\r\n so heavy upon the fields that in the open places the drifts were as\r\n high as a man. After the snow-storm had passed the cold redoubled, so\r\n that even the best clad suffered whenever they went out doors. There\r\n was not a house in the village where the water did not freeze, if it\r\n was not set close by the fire; and I do not exaggerate when I say\r\n that in many good and well-built houses wine froze before the great\r\n chimney, though the latter was heaped up with wood. I saw in many\r\n houses iron pots suspended above the fire with icicles hanging over\r\n the edge. Every night and morning when the people got up there was\r\n frost upon the coverlet, from the evaporation of the bodies of the\r\n sleepers. There was not a wine-cellar where the wine did not freeze\r\n in the casks, unless care was taken to keep charcoal fires burning\r\n there. In some wine-cellars it was necessary to close every aperture\r\n in order to prevent the wine from freezing. It frequently froze so\r\n hard that it was necessary to pierce the bung-hole with a red hot\r\n poker in order to draw it out. On the night of the 23-24 December, as\r\n also on Christmas night, the ice was so heavy upon the trees that the\r\n boughs were broken. These things had not been seen in France since\r\n the year 1480.[990] The greatest cold was on the day of the feast of\r\n the Innocents (December 28). Many men who were exposed died in the\r\n roads. The crests of cocks and poultry were frozen and fell off some\r\n days afterwards, and many were found dead under their roosts. The\r\n sheep also died.\r\n\r\n Early in January the ice began to melt. It grew uncommonly warm for\r\n the season, so that fire became unnecessary. On the day following\r\n the edict of the king, about noon, a soft warm rain began to fall,\r\n which caused the snow to vanish rapidly. This lasted for five days,\r\n so that the earth was covered with water. And then came a second cold\r\n for three entire weeks, until the 28th of the month, and snow with a\r\n high wind came, which drove the snow everywhere and piled it in great\r\n drifts. The winter grain was frozen in the furrows. God knows how much\r\n the poor people who had no wood suffered. Most of them stayed in bed\r\n night and day without getting up except to eat once in twenty-four\r\n hours. The poor of Paris and others who had no means, were compelled\r\n to burn their furniture. Those who had made no provision for the\r\n winter, chiefly of wood, were compelled to purchase at high prices,\r\n for it was not possible to do carting because of the condition of\r\n the roads; in many cases, moreover, the bridges were destroyed. When\r\n the thaw came, the high waters penetrated houses and churches in\r\n Provins to the depth of three, four, and even five feet, washing out\r\n the very dead in the cemetery.[991] At Paris the flood damaged the\r\n Pont-au-Change and caused many houses to topple. Vine-growers found\r\n themselves in great difficulty. Those who were wise cut their vines\r\n back to the root, in order that they might sprout better again, and\r\n were repaid for so doing, for they were the only ones that bore.\r\n\r\n The spring was fair and mild, so that barley and oats were sown. Yet\r\n much ground lay bare because in the fields sown with winter wheat\r\n the roots were all killed, so that no grain grew. The walnut trees\r\n seemed to be dead through all the month of April and half of May,\r\n for they did not put forth their buds. Pear and apple trees bore a\r\n few blossoms. In some places there were plums and cherries, but not\r\n everywhere.[992]\r\n\r\nThe winter was just as bad in Gascony, Provence, and Languedoc. On the\r\nday of the Feast of St. John the Baptist (June 24) it snowed![993]\r\nEven the poor people were compelled to build fires, though they could\r\nnot afford the fuel. The vines throughout central France were so badly\r\ninjured that not a third part of the crop remained. The grain likewise\r\nwas destroyed. Water courses were swollen and overflowed their banks,\r\nand in the meadows of the Seine people had to take care lest they be\r\ndrowned. As a result of the cold spring, the harvest of 1565 failed\r\nover almost all the realm to such an extent that it was necessary to\r\nabolish the tolls between provinces and to permit free trade in grain.\r\nParis imported wheat from Champagne, Picardy, Anjou, Lower Brittany,\r\nBurgundy, and Auvergne, the least stricken of the provinces.[994]\r\nThe Parlement of Paris passed an ordinance forbidding speculation in\r\nfoodstuffs and compelled those possessed of a surplus of grain to throw\r\nwhat was not needed for their own necessity upon the market.[995] A\r\nmeasure (_boisseau_) of wheat, from January to April cost from 12-15\r\nsous (= 1½ pecks at from 36 to 45 cents), and after April the price\r\nrose every week until harvest time, to the sum of 25 sous _tournois_\r\n(approximately 75 cents). Wheat was very dear in Paris and throughout\r\nall Brie, the Ile-de-France, Valois, Soissonais, and Picardy; less\r\nso in Champagne, Burgundy, and Lorraine, where there was rye and\r\nbarley enough for the people. The stock starved because the grain\r\nwas consumed by the people. Many people went over into Champagne in\r\norder to purchase rye and barley to make bread with until the harvest\r\ncame. Fortunately grain was plentiful in Champagne, and wheat fell\r\nto 7 and 6 sous per measure (from 19 to 22 cents), and corn in like\r\nproportion after the harvest. Because of the hard times which they had\r\nexperienced, many accumulated great stores in the expectation that in a\r\nshort time there would again be a dearth.\r\n\r\n Wine was very dear until the vintage. In the months of August and\r\n September before the grapes were gathered, it was not possible to\r\n purchase wine by the cup at taverns, even for silver; it was with\r\n great difficulty that sufficient wine was procurable for church\r\n service. But after the vintage the price dropped to 14 _livres\r\n tournois_ ($8.70) _la queue du creu_, whereas it had been as high as\r\n 80 before ($49.60).[996]\r\n\r\nAs so often appears elsewhere in history, the economic distress and\r\nstrain of poverty was followed by psychological manifestations of\r\na religio-sociological sort, among the lower and poor classes. In\r\n1565, in the villages of Champagne and Brie and especially in the\r\nbailiwicks of Sens, Melun, Montereau, Nogent, Troyes, Châlons, Rheims,\r\nEpernay, Château-Thierry, Meaux, and Provins, the belief spread among\r\nthe peasantry that in honor of the Virgin they ought to refrain from\r\nworking in the fields on Saturday after midday, and that this Saturday\r\nrest had been formally ordered by the Virgin in revelations and\r\napparitions. A young girl of Charly-sur-Marne, near Epernay, boasted\r\nof having received these confidences, and showed miraculous signs of\r\nher mission. But the cardinal of Lorraine caused her to be arrested and\r\nquestioned, and she was burned alive as a witch.[997]\r\n\r\nInstead of going to Paris, the court passed the winter at Moulins in\r\nBourbonnais,[998] where the famine was most slightly felt. By this\r\ntime the expectations of the Catholics and the fears of the Huguenots\r\nwere beginning to bear their bitter fruit, and in the state of public\r\ntension every incident was magnified. At Angers, in November, the\r\nRohans, having forbidden Catholic worship upon their domains, the King\r\nhad had to compel them to reinstate it by threatening to dispossess\r\nthem of their châteaux; at Blois the cardinal Bourbon reproached the\r\nqueen mother for suffering the edict to be violated by permitting the\r\nqueen of Navarre and the prince of Condé to maintain court-preachers\r\nin their entourage. The Catholics of Dijon demanded that in future\r\nCalvinist ministers be forbidden to attend the last hours of the dying,\r\na petition which the cardinal of Lorraine supported in order to make\r\nthe chancellor L’Hôpital commit himself. The answer of the latter\r\nsustained the edict’s grant of the right of selection in the matter of\r\nreligion. Of greater anxiety still was the influx of Huguenots into\r\nthe town of Moulins, Montgomery among the rest, who for the first time\r\nsince the fatal tournament of June 30, 1559, looked upon the court.[999]\r\n\r\nThe memory of the conspiracy of Amboise haunted the queen like a\r\nspecter, and was the more vivid because of the _rapprochement_ between\r\nthe leaders of the Huguenots and the Montmorencys, who had met together\r\nat Paris in November at the marriage of the amorous prince of Condé\r\nto Mlle. de Longueville. The incident was sharp enough to strike fire\r\nbetween the Catholic-Guisard and the Huguenot-Montmorency party. For\r\nwhen the papal nuncio indignantly demanded the cardinal of Beauvais’\r\nrenunciation of the purple, the constable bluffly said: “I am a papist.\r\nBut if the Pope and his agents still seek to trouble the kingdom, my\r\nsword will be Huguenot. My nephew will never renounce his dignity. The\r\nedict gives him the right to it.” It is no wonder Catherine de Medici\r\nwas anxious to hear of the report of these words at Madrid and what\r\nPhilip II would say.[1000] The interdiction of the Protestant worship\r\nat Moulins on January 9, 1566, on the very day that Coligny returned\r\nfrom the wedding festivities, was her own reply.\r\n\r\nThe very next day she guarded against new fire being struck between\r\nthe factions by compelling at least outward reconciliation between\r\nthe admiral and the cardinal of Lorraine. On January 10, 1566, in the\r\npresence of the court, she addressed the cardinal, saying that the\r\nrepose of the kingdom was destroyed by private quarrels and especially\r\nby two of his, the one with the marshal Montmorency, the other with\r\nthe admiral for the murder of the duke of Guise.[1001] At the same\r\ntime the queen mother, in order to preserve peace between the rivals,\r\nhit upon the novel scheme of lodging the cardinal and the admiral in\r\nthe same house, so that each had to use the same stairway in order to\r\nreach his apartments, telling both that each was keeper of the other,\r\nand that if either of them experienced any injury it would be imputed\r\nto the other.[1002] The cardinal of Lorraine, for fear of losing all\r\nhis influence, accepted the situation (he did not stir from the side of\r\nthe queen),[1003] and was compelled to abide by the situation _telle\r\nquelle_, as Sir Thomas Smith wrote to Cecil.[1004] But nothing could\r\nmollify the anger of the constable against the Guises, and when the\r\nduke of Guise at length came to court in February, Montmorency left it\r\nforthwith.[1005]\r\n\r\nWhile the factional feeling thus grew more embittered, serious\r\nand noble effort was yet made to carry out the demands of the\r\nStates-General of Orleans and Pontoise—demands which were principles\r\nof the political Huguenots. This programme was supported by the queen\r\nmother, who seems in this way to have sought to placate the fears of\r\nthe Huguenots for their faith. The year 1566 is notable for the fact\r\nthat greater recognition was then accorded the political demands of the\r\nHuguenots than at any time hitherto, so that large progress was made in\r\nthe betterment of the administrative system of France.\r\n\r\nThe King in his address to the council said that at his accession he\r\nhad wanted to travel through all the provinces desolated by the late\r\ncivil wars, in order to hear the complaints of his subjects and to\r\nremedy conditions in the best manner possible; that it was for this\r\ncause that he had convoked the assembly and so enjoined them, in virtue\r\nof the royal authority, to apply themselves diligently to affairs.\r\n\r\nThen the chancellor spoke: after dwelling upon the general evils of\r\nthe state, he asserted that the root of all the evils was the bad\r\nadministration of justice; that the King had become convinced of this\r\nin the course of the tour of the provinces; that for himself he could\r\nnot refrain from calling things by their right name and from speaking\r\nas he thought; that those who were appointed to administer justice were\r\nguilty of great excesses; that these evils had increased owing to the\r\nimpunity and the license which obtained.\r\n\r\n I do not deny [he added] that there are too many laws and ordinances\r\n in France and that the multitude of the laws and the number of the\r\n judges is the cause of much unnecessary and tyrannical litigation.\r\n But it is no less true that when new evils arise there is a necessity\r\n of new remedies, and that when the ancient laws have been abrogated\r\n either by inobservance or by license, it is necessary to make new ones\r\n in order to cure current evils and to arrest the course of public\r\n calamity. The public welfare requires new legislation. If the new\r\n laws are not observed, on account of the venality and avarice of the\r\n ministers of justice, they must be punished severely and these public\r\n pests who fatten upon the blood of a miserable people must be driven\r\n from office. Superfluous offices, moreover, must be abolished and the\r\n ruinous multiplication of legal causes stopped.\r\n\r\nThe justice of the last charge was particularly manifest. Since the\r\ntime of Francis I it had been the practice of the crown to sell offices\r\nand even to create them for purposes of revenue only.\r\n\r\nThe chancellor further asserted that the King could not suffer those\r\nwho had not the right to make laws to attribute to themselves the\r\npower to interpret them; he proposed to diminish the excessive number\r\nof the courts, and raised the question whether the demands of justice\r\nwould not be better met if the Parlement ceased to be so sedentary and\r\nbecame ambulatory instead—a suggestion which, it is interesting to\r\nobserve, found a partial realization in the seventeenth century in the\r\nestablishment of the Grands Jours d’Auvergne. He insinuated that it was\r\nadvisable to subject the judges to censure and to compel them to render\r\naccount of the manner in which they exercised their office, and that\r\nit might be better to establish judges for two or three years than to\r\npermit the holding of office in perpetuity.\r\n\r\nAfter longer deliberation, in February, 1566, the famous ordinance\r\nof Moulins was framed. It contained eighty-six articles, and dealt\r\nradically with the evils of the time and imposed drastic reform,\r\nespecially in the administration of justice.\r\n\r\n This act declared the royal domain inalienable, limited and regulated\r\n the right of remonstrances of parlement, organized circuits of\r\n inspection by magistrates especially appointed to go throughout the\r\n realm, instituted certain changes in the judicial administration,\r\n and pledged the word of the crown to appoint capable and honest\r\n magistrates.[1006]\r\n\r\nIt profoundly modified both the public and private law of France. In\r\nthe former sphere the ordinance strengthened the legislative power of\r\nthe crown by laying down the principle that the King’s ordinances must\r\nbe observed in spite of remonstrances on the part of the parlements,\r\nand even if the latter refused to register them; the _maîtres des\r\nrequêtes_ were enjoined to punish severely any infraction or failure to\r\nobserve the ordinances. The powers of the governors in the provinces\r\nwere much reduced; they were forbidden to exercise the right of pardon,\r\nto levy taxes, or to institute fairs and markets. The judicial power\r\nof the great _villes_ was almost entirely suppressed. The communal\r\njudges were deprived of all civil jurisdiction and retained cognizance\r\nonly of petty offenses; at the same time, the attempt was made to\r\nrestrain seigneurial jurisdiction. The right of written proof was\r\nrecognized in cases involving 100 livres or more.[1007] No less than\r\n1,500 superfluous offices, treasurerships, secretaryships, etc., were\r\nabolished. In the matter of religion some of the articles were a\r\nconfirmation of the edict of 1563. Another article abolished entirely\r\nall confraternities, and prohibited the formation of all leagues.[1008]\r\n\r\nThe financial administration came in for a most searching\r\ninvestigation. The flaunting arrogance of some of the King’s treasurers\r\nis remarkable. Numbers of them had had houses, and even châteaux\r\nwhich rivaled the King’s own in elegance, the means to purchase and\r\nfurnish which they had secured by plundering the people and robbing\r\nthe government. One treasurer—among four who were hanged at\r\nMontfaucon—was found to owe the crown over three million livres.[1009]\r\n\r\nThe young duke of Guise, who had refused to be a party to the farcical\r\nreconciliation between his house and the Châtillons soon found means\r\nto leave the court. In May the duke of Nemours and the duchess of\r\nGuise were married at St. Maur-des-Fosses. It was a match which sowed\r\ndragon’s teeth once more. For Nemours forsook his wife, who was a\r\nRohan, having induced the Pope to nullify the marriage. The Huguenots\r\nmurmured indignantly against the insult done the Rohan clan whose\r\npowerful family influence was now joined with the Châtillons and\r\nMontmorencys.[1010]\r\n\r\nCatherine de Medici was not the ruler to govern France with a firm yet\r\nfacile hand under the circumstances that existed in 1566. Irrespective\r\nof foreign influences, which we shall presently come to, the economic\r\ndistress[1011] of the country, the rivalry of the great houses, and\r\nthe religious acrimony prevailing made a combination of forces that\r\nneeded another sort of ruler to reconcile them—a ruler such as Henry\r\nof Navarre was to be. The queen mother, while a woman of force, was so\r\ndeficient in sincerity that no one could have confidence in her; so\r\njealous of power that she would brook no other control of the King,\r\nwhose sovereignty she confounded with her maternal oversight of him,\r\nmaking no distinction between Charles IX the ruler and Charles IX\r\nthe son. Catherine time and again marred or ruined the progress she\r\nhad made with the aid of one party’s support by her own envious fear\r\nof that party’s predominance. Her “bridge policy,”[1012] instead of\r\nuniting France, kept it divided. To maintain the balance of power—an\r\nimmemorial Italian policy—her Italian nature resorted to duplicity and\r\ndeception continually. Accordingly, suspicion prevailed at court and\r\nsuspicion prevailed in the provinces, the more so in the latter because\r\nof the Huguenots’ uncertainty about what was done at Bayonne, and doubt\r\nas to Philip II’s course. Men were doubtful of their neighbors; towns\r\nwere fearful of other nearby towns. “All the way of my coming hither,”\r\nreported Sir Thomas Hoby, the new English ambassador to France, “I\r\nfound the strong towns marvelously jealous of strangers, insomuch that\r\nonly by the sound of a bell they discovered a number of horsemen or\r\nfootmen before they come; but also, after they are entered they have an\r\neye to them.”[1013]\r\n\r\nWhen the court finally moved to Paris, the great nobles came thither\r\nwith such numerous trains[1014] that the queen sent four companies\r\nof the King’s guard ahead of his coming, and ordered the marshal\r\nMontmorency to require the retirement from the city of all those who\r\nwere not of the ordinary household of each nobleman and gentleman. In\r\nvain the marshal, anxious to protect his party against the Guisards,\r\nresisted the order and complained that the queen was interfering with\r\nhis authority. The King ordered Lansac and De la Garde to accomplish\r\nwhat Montmorency was unwilling to do.\r\n\r\nIf choice must be made as to who were the worst offenders in this\r\nrespect, the greater blame lies with the Protestants. It was not\r\nonly impolitic, it was insolent on their part to permit Montgomery\r\nto swagger around Paris as he did, “booted and spurred with all\r\nhis men.”[1015] Apparently the queen had not the daring to compel\r\nhis withdrawal, as she did that of the Guises’ recruiting sergeant,\r\nRoggendorf.[1016] Her policy for the time being was to favor the\r\nChâtillon-Montmorency faction.[1017] Backed by the joint support of\r\nthe admiral and the constable, the queen accordingly undertook to\r\nbring certain unsettled or indefinite matters of religion and the\r\nchurch to a conclusion. On May 31, 1566, Charles IX sent a series of\r\narticles to the cardinal Bourbon for consideration by the clergy of\r\nParis, then sitting at St. Germain des Près. Two of these had to do\r\nwith the baptism of infants where one of the parents was a Catholic,\r\nand the maintenance of Protestants schools. Three concerned church\r\ntemporalities, namely, the redemption of the fourth part of the\r\ntemporals of the church, given to the King during the late civil war;\r\nthe subsidy which was to expire in eighteen months; and the preparation\r\nof an edict defining the privileges and jurisdiction of the church.\r\nThe residue of the articles dealt with infractions of the Edict of\r\nAmboise, such as restraint of preaching according to the edict, and the\r\nmolestation of former Protestants who had returned to the church of\r\nRome by the Huguenots. By an awkward coincidence, the sending of these\r\narticles exactly coincided with the arrival of the papal legate in\r\nParis, who came to request the promulgation of the decrees of Trent in\r\nconformity with the agreement made with the cardinal de Santa Croce at\r\nBayonne.[1018]\r\n\r\nCatherine de Medici’s policy at this time was that of the political\r\nHuguenots. She hoped that the question of religion would settle\r\nitself with time, and to divert attention from that issue, and also\r\nbecause there was great need of it, she energetically continued the\r\nadministrative and economic reforms begun at Moulins. L’Hôpital began\r\nso searching an investigation of the conduct of the King’s treasurers\r\nthat some of them were hanged and others banished. The constable was\r\nof service here, although his notorious avarice tarnished the honesty\r\nof his work.[1019] Yet there was peril even in a policy so just and so\r\nmuch needed by France. Sooner or later such a course would unearth the\r\ndishonesty of bigger thieves than the small collectors of the revenue\r\nwho, in many cases undoubtedly suffered for the peculation of their\r\nsuperiors. The administration was full of “grafters” such as St. André\r\nhad been, who would not scruple to conceal their thievery behind the\r\nsmoke of another civil war. The queen mother knew this only too well\r\nfrom former experience, not being unaware of the fact that one of the\r\ncauses of “the late unpleasantness” was the demand of the estates that\r\nthe Guises should make an accounting and be forced to disgorge their\r\nill-gotten gains. The government resorted to various devices to raise\r\nmoney and an imposition was laid upon inn-keepers. The most singular\r\nexpedient, though, was the offer of a Genoese syndicate to pay the King\r\na lump sum for the privilege of taxing dowry gifts and for a license\r\nto endure eight years to levy a crown on every first-born infant, and\r\nafter, for every boy born into a family five sous, and for every girl\r\nbabe, three sous.[1020] This preposterous measure actually passed the\r\ncouncil, and was only prevented from becoming law by the good sense of\r\nthe Parlement.[1021]\r\n\r\nBut the events happening in the Netherlands were of greater importance\r\nto France at this time than anything within her borders. From the\r\nbeginning of the insurrection there the Huguenots had recognized\r\nthe important bearing of that struggle upon their own movement, and\r\nas the shadow of Philip II fell in greater length each year across\r\nFrance, the interest of the French Protestants in the rebellion of\r\nthe Low Countries increased.[1022] As Huguenot preachers in Flanders\r\nsowed the double seed of Calvinism and revolt, so Protestant preachers\r\nexiled from the Low Countries sought refuge in France.[1023] This\r\nintercourse became a formidable historical issue by 1566. The issue\r\nwas understood from the beginning by all parties concerned, and Philip\r\nII and his ministers were determined to profit by the lesson of France\r\nand to prevent similar trouble by crushing all opposition in the bud.\r\nThe Turkish attack upon Malta[1024] had been very favorable to the\r\nProtestant cause, and the raising of the siege in September, 1565,\r\nprobably influenced the King of Spain in his resolution to extirpate\r\nheresy in the Low Countries.[1025] The Flemish government suspected\r\nWilliam of Orange who by July was openly allied with the Gueux[1026]\r\nand his brother, Louis of Nassau, of direct intercourse with Condé and\r\nColigny,[1027] and sent Montigny—the faithless member of the patriotic\r\nquartette composed of Orange, Egmont, Hoorne, and himself—to Paris in\r\nthe spring to pick up information.[1028] The fear lest Montgomery might\r\ncome to Flanders, which Granvella had once laughed at, by the summer of\r\n1566 had some basis of reality, although the braggadocio character of\r\nthis adventurer discounted alarm.[1029]\r\n\r\nKnowledge of the solidarity existing between his revolted subjects in\r\nFlanders and the Huguenots[1030] which Montluc had warned Philip of\r\neven two years before,[1031] coupled with information concerning the\r\ndealings of Louis of Nassau with Protestant Germany[1032] and France,\r\nstirred the Spanish King’s habitual indecision into action. He sounded\r\nCharles IX as to the possibility of sending Spanish troops directly\r\nacross France to the Low Countries and asked him to restrain his\r\nsubjects from coming thither with arms,[1033] crowds of whom went to\r\nFlanders disguised as merchants.[1034] Simultaneously Margaret of Parma\r\nbegged the Emperor to take the same course.[1035] But the government\r\nof France could not have honored Philip II’s request, even if it had\r\nbeen so minded, without risking an immediate rising of the Huguenots.\r\nAs a matter of fact, it had no desire to do so. The resentment felt by\r\nFrance toward Spain on account of past scores at Trent, Rome, and in\r\nSwitzerland, was now all eclipsed in her rancor because of the massacre\r\nby the Spaniards of her ill-fated colony in Florida in September,\r\n1565.[1036]\r\n\r\nAlexander VI’s bull had divided the western hemisphere between the\r\nSpanish and the Portuguese. Florida belonged to Spain. France had built\r\nFort Caroline on Spanish territory. As peace existed in 1565, France\r\nargued that the massacre by Menendez was a violation of international\r\nlaw. To this Spain replied that Florida belonged to her by discovery\r\nand as all treaties between Spain and France were silent as to any\r\nchange of ownership, there really had been no such change in law.\r\nConsequently the French settlers were intruders and heretics to boot.\r\nThe answer was crushing, Fourquevaux was heavily handicapped, for he\r\ncould not openly espouse the cause of Frenchmen who were heretics.\r\nBefore news of the massacre reached France, Philip II, knowing the\r\nfacts, inquired if the French expedition had been commanded or\r\nsanctioned by the French King. The only answer possible was a negative.\r\nAn affirmative answer would have been tantamount to a declaration of\r\nwar. “Then the incident is closed,” was the Spanish reply. This was\r\nfollowed by a demand that Coligny, under whose sanction the expedition\r\nhad sailed, should be punished.\r\n\r\nFrance was likewise at odds with the Emperor. The reason for this is\r\nto be found in the strong attitude the empire had lately taken on\r\nthe question of Metz.[1037] Understanding of this question entails\r\na glance backward. In 1564 the baron Bolwiller, a native of upper\r\nAlsace, but at that time bailiff of the Emperor in the grand bailiwick\r\nof Haguenau, revived the plan he had conceived in 1558, of recovering\r\nMetz by a surprise.[1038] Bolwiller represented that no time was to\r\nbe lost if France was to be prevented from fixing her hold upon the\r\nThree Bishoprics forever. Philip II favored the enterprise and offered\r\n20,000 sous cash, and the assignment of 8,000 écus annual revenue of\r\nthe territory, “pour celluy ou ceulx qui’lz luy rendroyent la ville\r\ndu dict Metz.”[1039] For with Metz in the hands of the Hapsburgs once\r\nmore, the chain of provinces connecting the Netherlands with Spain\r\nthrough mid-Europe would have been practically complete, lying as Metz,\r\nToul, and Verdun did, between Franche-Comté and Luxembourg.[1040] This\r\nwas at the time when Condé was recreant to his people and was dallying\r\nwith the widow of the marshal St. André, and the idea was conceived and\r\nabandoned of buying the prince over and bribing him to betray Metz to\r\nSpain.[1041] Spain, however, in order to avoid a rupture with France\r\nwished to conceal her own participation in the plot to recover Metz,\r\nand urged the Emperor Maximilian to undertake the venture.[1042] The\r\nplot was to tempt Metz to revolt against France by offering to convert\r\nit into a free imperial city, it being expected that the Lutherans in\r\nthe city would support the movement.[1043] The alertness of the French\r\ngovernment, however, foiled the project’s being undertaken in April.\r\nIn August Bolwiller renewed his plan, alleging to Chantonnay that the\r\npeople of Metz were ready to provide 20,000 écus, and that there were\r\narms in plenty stored in secret. He urged prompt action now for the\r\nFrench government had begun the erection of a citadel in the city.[1044]\r\n\r\nBy this time Philip II was so anxious to see France despoiled of Metz\r\nand so impatient at Maximilian’s delay, that it was even considered\r\nadvisable by some to take advantage of the check given the Turks at\r\nMalta and have the Emperor make peace with them in order to have his\r\nhands free in the Three Bishoprics.[1045] As for himself, Philip II\r\ndared not make an overt move against France, lest in the event of war\r\nwith Spain, Charles IX appeal to the Huguenots, with the result that\r\nProtestantism would profit by the diversion.[1046]\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile things in Metz had got beyond control of either Spain\r\nor the empire. The Calvinists in both France and the Netherlands had\r\nbeen quick to see the advantage afforded, for the former by gaining\r\npossession of the territory could connect France and the Palatinate,\r\nthus aiding themselves and their coreligionists at one and the same\r\ntime, since by so doing the land route of Spain through Central Europe,\r\nvia Milan, Besançon, and Luxembourg, would be cut in half. Matters came\r\nto a head in May and June, 1565, in what is known as the “Cardinal’s\r\nWar.” On May 5 the Emperor Maximilian had issued a decree affirming\r\nhis suzerainty over Metz, Toul, and Verdun. The cardinal of Lorraine\r\nat once recognized the validity of this decree, which was equivalent\r\nto treason to France. Thereupon, in the name of Charles IX Salzedo an\r\nex-Spaniard[1047] and leader of the French party in Metz assumed the\r\ntitle of governor of Metz and appealed to the French King for support\r\nagainst the cardinal. The issue was really one between France and\r\nSpain. The Guises naturally supported the cardinal. The “war” which\r\nfollowed was not formidable, although the issue as stake was of great\r\nimportance. But the cardinal soon discovered that discretion was the\r\nbetter part of valor and yielded to the King, more especially as\r\nneither Philip II nor Maximilian raised a hand for fear of betraying\r\nthemselves, for the cardinal feared that if he resisted longer Charles\r\nIX would refuse to pardon his treasonable conduct. He was not unaware\r\nof the fact—he did not even deny it—that it was known that he had\r\nbeen in treasonable communication with Bolwiller and the archbishop of\r\nTrèves.[1048]\r\n\r\nIf Charles IX and the queen mother had known the full extent of the\r\ncardinal of Lorraine’s treasonable conduct at this time they might\r\nnot have been so lenient toward him. For he was guilty not only of\r\ntreasonable intercourse with the empire, but directly with Spain also.\r\nThe one supremely important result of this petty war over Metz is that\r\nat this time the cardinal—and with him the whole Guise house—began\r\nthose secret negotiations with Philip of Spain which culminated\r\nin the establishment of the Holy League. Shortly after the end of\r\nhis ignominious war around Metz, burning with anger and shame, the\r\ncardinal sent a secret agent to Franche Comté, who found Granvella\r\nat Beaudencourt in July, 1565, to whom he recited the cardinal’s\r\ngrievances, saying that owing to the death of his brother the duke of\r\nGuise and the insolence of the marshal Montmorency, he had no hope\r\nin the justice of Charles IX. The agent then went on to point out\r\nthe great danger threatening Catholic Europe by reason of what had\r\nrecently happened at Metz, and, speaking for the cardinal of Lorraine,\r\nexpressed the wish that Philip II would enter into a league with the\r\nhouse of Guise, the duke of Montpensier—Alva’s convert at Bayonne—and\r\ncertain others for the protection of the Catholic faith in France\r\nand the overthrow of the Châtillons, the prince of Condé, “Madame de\r\nVendôme,” and other Huguenots. This formidable overture was made under\r\nthe seal of secrecy. The cautious Granvella listened but refrained\r\nfrom committing his master to the proposition.[1049] Again, Philip II\r\nhesitated to implicate himself so directly in French affairs, as the\r\ncardinal of Lorraine urged, just as he had hesitated the year before\r\nwith Montluc, and while he waited events in the Low Countries went\r\nfrom bad to worse.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1566, a furious outburst of iconoclasm swept through the\r\nchurches of Flanders.\r\n\r\n Commencing at St. Omer, the contagion rapidly spread, and in a\r\n fortnight 400 churches were sacked in Flanders alone, while in Antwerp\r\n the cathedral was stripped of all its treasures. Images, relics,\r\n shrines, paintings, manuscripts, and books shared a common fate.[1050]\r\n\r\nThe event stirred Philip to action. He determined to send the duke of\r\nAlva to Flanders to repress things with an iron hand.[1051]\r\n\r\nOn November 18, 1566, the duke of Alva formally requested the French\r\nambassador at Madrid to secure Charles IX’s permission for a Spanish\r\narmy to cross France.\r\n\r\n The remedy has become little by little so difficult [said the duke]\r\n that deeds not words and remonstrances, are now necessary. Having\r\n exhausted all good and gracious means to reduce things in the Low\r\n Countries, the King is constrained, to his great regret, to have\r\n recourse to force. Public assemblies, preaching, the bearing of arms,\r\n and violence prevail in the land and the King’s ministers amount to\r\n nothing.\r\n\r\nThe duke then outlined the plan. Ten thousand new Spanish recruits\r\nunder three ensigns were to be sent to Luxembourg, Naples, Sardinia,\r\nand Sicily to take the places of as many veteran troops there,\r\nfor the King was unwilling to use Italian infantry. A thousand\r\nheavy-armed footmen and three or four hundred mounted arquebusiers,\r\nall Spanish, were to be drawn from Milan, the most loyal of Spain’s\r\nItalian dependencies. An indefinite number of reiters and other\r\nmercenaries could be had for the asking. These troops would proceed\r\nto the Netherlands through Savoy by way of Val d’Aoste or Mt. Cenis,\r\nMontmélian, Chambéry, and La Bresse, into Franche Comté and Lorraine,\r\nunless—and this was the crux of Alva’s interview with Fourquevaux—the\r\nwinter season made it impossible to traverse the mountain passes, in\r\nwhich case His Catholic Majesty desired leave of France to take them by\r\nsea to Marseilles or Toulon and thence to march them northward up the\r\nRhône to La Bresse and so reach Franche Comté.\r\n\r\nNo one knew better than Alva the formidable nature of this proposition\r\nto France and he used all his artifice to conceal its danger, dwelling\r\non the mutual connection between the Huguenot and the Flemish movement\r\nand the benefit that France would derive from the crushing of the\r\nrebellion in the Low Countries. Fourquevaux in reply declared that\r\nthe Huguenots would fly to arms again, if a Spanish army should enter\r\nFrance, to which the duke rejoined that the presence of a Spanish army\r\nwould so overawe them that they would not dare to do so. The ambassador\r\nthen inquired whether the Emperor could support Philip, seeing that\r\nhe was engaged in a war with the Turks[1052] and was incapable of\r\nraising funds in his behalf. Alva told him that the German princes\r\nwould perceive that the Flemings were merely rebels and that “no prince\r\nor soldier in Germany, even were he a Lutheran, would refuse to take\r\nthe pay of Spain.”[1053] But Fourquevaux refused to be convinced by\r\nAlva’s smooth words. He had information that Spain was borrowing ships\r\nfrom Malta, Genoa, and the papacy and Savoy and warned Charles IX to\r\nstrengthen the garrisons in Languedoc and Provence.[1054]\r\n\r\nThis information threw the court of France into great excitement.\r\nCatherine de Medici declared that the heretics would take up arms\r\nimmediately, under such circumstances.[1055] The King wrote to\r\nFourquevaux on December 24 not to spare any efforts to penetrate\r\nthe designs of Spain.[1056] Sixteen thousand troops were sent into\r\nthe Lyonnais at once.[1057] The marshal Vieilleville returned to\r\nMetz.[1058] The government began the erection of a great citadel in\r\nVerdun and to fortify the frontier against Luxembourg.[1059] D’Andelot\r\nwas sent to Switzerland to make new enrolments.[1060] An agent was sent\r\ninto Normandy with instructions to pass along the coast and take the\r\nnames of master-mariners and sailors.[1061] The queen of Navarre began\r\nto mobilize forces in Béarn.[1062] All this time the duke of Alva kept\r\nendeavoring to quiet French alarm by reiterating that he would use all\r\nmeans in his power to avoid troubling France and that the army destined\r\nfor Flanders, now increased by 1,500 light horse composed of Spaniards,\r\nItalians, and Albanians, would go by the valley of the Rhône only as a\r\nlast recourse.[1063]\r\n\r\nFinally, in the middle of February, the duke of Alva’s preparations\r\nwere made. Don Juan de Acuna, who had been sent to Savoy to make\r\narrangements with the duke for the transit of the Spanish army,\r\nreturned, after having made a satisfactory settlement. The army\r\nwas to go through Savoy, via the Mt. Cenis and Chambéry, cross the\r\nRhône at Yenne, and so proceed to Besançon in Franche Comté, where\r\nit was to be joined by German contingents. This averted the danger\r\nthreatening Languedoc and Dauphiné, but threw it upon French Burgundy\r\nand Champagne.[1064] It was a roundabout route for the Spanish troops\r\nin the Milanais, but it was impossible to send them directly through\r\nSwitzerland by way of the Grisons, Constance, Basel, and Strasburg\r\nwithout inflaming these localities; above all, Geneva would thereby\r\nhave been menaced, and any movement imperiling that city would have\r\nfired the entire Calvinist world.[1065]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: March of the DUKE of ALVA\r\n\r\nTHROUGH SAVOY, FRANCHE COMTÉ AND LORRAINE.\r\n\r\n———————- Conjectured route]\r\n\r\nIn the face of common peril Bern, Freiburg, and Valais concluded a\r\ndefensive league on February 20, while Basel and Zurich took up arms\r\nwith French approval. Fear of a joint attack of Spain and Savoy upon\r\nGeneva prevailed throughout Switzerland, which was divided into two\r\ncamps, the five cantons of the center favoring designs upon Geneva\r\nand the Vaud. Spain aimed to profit by the impression produced by the\r\npassage of her troops close to the Swiss frontier to force certain\r\nmilitary advantages and dispossess France from the exceptional\r\nsituation she had lately secured in the Alps. The western cantons\r\nwere offered cheap salt from Franche Comté, and those of the center\r\ngrain from the Milanais. The duke of Lorraine also offered salt at a\r\nlow price from his duchy. As a result Bern found herself deserted by\r\nwestern Switzerland and apparently single-handed about to be called\r\nupon to protect Geneva from Spanish attack. Perhaps if Spain had been\r\ncertain of the support of Savoy at this juncture, this might have\r\nhappened, but the duke of Savoy was content to profit by the fear of\r\nthe Bernois to compel them to restore the three bailiwicks which they\r\nhad formerly agreed to do in the treaty of Lausanne, October 30, 1564,\r\nbut had delayed to fulfil. Charles IX himself advised Bern to yield in\r\nthis particular and in August the settlement with the duke of Savoy was\r\nmade.[1066]\r\n\r\nAll that Philip now requested of France was leave for French subjects\r\nto provide the army with supplies in its course. Again Fourquevaux\r\nurged his sovereign to be cautious; the fact that France was just\r\nrecovering from a year of famine and could ill spare sustenance for\r\nothers was not so important as the necessity of avoiding every occasion\r\nof civil war.[1067]\r\n\r\nOn May 10, 1567, the duke of Alva sailed from Cartagena and arrived at\r\nGenoa on May 27. St. Ambroise at the foot of the Alps was the point\r\nwhere his munitions and provisions were concentrated. Here on June\r\n2 the duke had a grand review of his troops. There were 19 ensigns\r\n(3,230 men), from Naples, under the command of Alonzo de Uloa; 10\r\nensigns from Sicily (1,620 men) under command of Julian Romero; 10\r\nensigns of Lombard troops (2,200 men) under command of Don Sancho\r\nde Londono; 10 Sardinian ensigns with four companies of recruits in\r\naddition (1,728 men) under command of Don Gonzalo de Bracamonte, making\r\na total of 49 ensigns of Spanish infantry (8,778 men). The duke’s\r\ncavalry was composed of five companies of Spanish light horse and\r\nthree Italian and two Albanian companies and two companies of Spanish\r\narquebusiers on horseback, in all 1,200 horses.[1068] On the march a\r\ncompany of 15 musketeers was placed between each ensign. This was the\r\nfirst instance in modern warfare when muskets were used in the field.\r\nHitherto this weapon had been so enormously heavy that it was used in\r\nsiege work only, balanced upon a triangle of wood or iron.[1069]\r\n\r\nThe route lay via Alessandria de la Paille, St. Ambroise, Aosta,\r\nTurin, the Mont Cenis, St. Jean de Maurienne, and the valley of the\r\nArve through Savoy. In spite of his small array it was necessary to\r\ndivide the army into three parts, the advance guard, the “battle,” and\r\nthe rear guard. The “battle” each day occupied the place abandoned by\r\nthe advance guard and was itself in turn replaced by the rear guard,\r\nthe three divisions of the army marching one day apart. The duke of\r\nAlva commanded the advance guard, his son Don Ferdinand Alvarez de\r\nToledo the “battle;” while the rear guard was under the command of the\r\nItalian, Ciappin-Vitelli, Marquis of Cetona formally in the service\r\nof the Grand Duke of Tuscany. The army thus divided occupied fourteen\r\ndays in traversing Savoy. It was a long and toilsome journey through a\r\nwild and mountainous country, where the difficulties of the march were\r\nincreased by constant dread of famine. In many places the country was\r\ncompletely sterile. In Burgundy the march was easier and twelve days\r\nbrought the army via Dôle and Gray to Fonteney near Toul, whence twelve\r\ndays more brought Alva by Thionville to Luxembourg (July 29), where he\r\nwas joined by new forces.[1070]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the length of the march and the hardships of it, the duke\r\nretained his traditional iron discipline and the soldiers were not\r\nallowed to forage upon the country or to break ranks.[1071]\r\n\r\nOn August 12, 1567, the duke of Alva entered Brussels. General terror\r\nprevailed in the Low Countries upon his arrival. The Prince of Orange\r\nleft the land. Count Egmont, naïvely declaring that he had done nothing\r\nwrong, remained; his friend Hoorne imitated his example. Alva at\r\nonce sent away all the Flemish soldiers and quartered the city with\r\nthe new troops. In order to facilitate his policy the duke created a\r\nspecial tribunal, _not_ composed of lawyers “because they would not\r\ncondemn without proofs.” This was the famous Council of Troubles which\r\nthe people called the “Council of Blood.” The members of it held no\r\ncommissions from the King, but were the simple agents of the duke of\r\nAlva. The most celebrated of them was a certain Vargas, a criminal\r\nhimself, against whom action had been suspended in return for his\r\ninfamous services.\r\n\r\nIf the policy of the Spanish government in Flanders took a new and\r\ndifferent form with the coming of Alva, the revolution there was no\r\nless changed. The cardinal Granvella some months before this time had\r\nwritten to Philip II: “It is a general rule, in matters of state, that\r\npopular enterprises, if they do not terminate in the first outburst,\r\ngenerally vanish in smoke if the remedy for them be applied before they\r\nhave time to follow up the movement.”[1072] He added that contemporary\r\nhistory afforded some striking examples of the truth of this\r\nobservation. But the provinces he had lately governed were not of this\r\ncategory. For it is clear that a change had taken place in the nature\r\nof the Flemish revolt in the years 1565-67. The revolution by this time\r\nhad passed through the earlier stages of defiance and rebellion and\r\ndeveloped an organization with a definite, set purpose before it. The\r\nformation of the Gueux was the clearest manifestation of this change.\r\nIn its inception this famous group was an aristocratic body, composed\r\nsolely of nobles, and the Spanish government had little fear then of\r\nits becoming a popular association.[1073] Granvella saw the similarity\r\nof the Gueux to the Huguenot association formed at Orleans in 1562, but\r\nhe did not anticipate the popular nature it was soon to develop.[1074]\r\n\r\nHe was soon disillusioned. What was believed by the Spanish government\r\nto be a somewhat close political and aristocratic combination of nobles\r\nbefore long became a popular confederation of congregations having a\r\nreligious propaganda, as well as a political purpose.[1075] Despite\r\nthis change, however, Philip’s minister did not yet believe the Gueux\r\nto be formidable. As Alva had declared at Bayonne that all that was\r\nnecessary to destroy the Huguenot party in France was to kill the “big\r\nfish,” so he now believed that if the leaders of the Gueux were cut\r\noff, their movement would die too.[1076] But Alva soon discovered\r\nthat the Gueux were hardly ever weakened by the detachment of certain\r\nof the nobles either by bribery or intimidation.[1077] By the time\r\nof his arrival, under Brederode’s able leadership, the Calvinists of\r\nthe Flemish provinces had worked out a scheme of union in which every\r\ncongregation was at once a parish, a rating precinct, a military\r\nhundred, and a political unit. Antwerp, whose population was so large\r\nand so cosmopolitan that police scrutiny could be easily evaded, and\r\nfrom which it was easy to make one’s escape, was the capital of the\r\nassociation, as Orleans first, and later La Rochelle, was for the\r\nHuguenots.[1078]\r\n\r\nThe Flemish government was soon alive to the necessity of breaking the\r\npower of this confederation.[1079] Membership in the confederation,\r\nif proved, was heavily punished. The retirement of the prince of\r\nOrange from the land was believed by the government to be due to a\r\nprudent effort to avoid being so compromised. It was certainly true\r\nof Brederode. But Egmont and Hoorne remained, declaring they had done\r\nnothing, and renewed their oath of allegiance to the King.[1080]\r\nNevertheless Granvella sarcastically quoted Lycurgus that neutrals were\r\nmore odious than enemies. “After the towns have been cleared out,”\r\nwrote the provost Morillon, “it will be time to attack the garden in\r\norder to destroy the weeds and roots there,” and Spain’s agent at\r\nAmsterdam at the same time wrote: “God may pardon those who are the\r\ncause of _one_ and the _other_ league; but I assure you, unless I am\r\nmuch mistaken, that those who have made others to dance, have some\r\nother purpose than we know. Time will discover it.”[1081]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXECUTION OF EGMONT AND HOORNE IN THE MARKET SQUARE AT\r\nBRUSSELS\r\n\r\nOriginal copper plate by Franz Hogenberg.]\r\n\r\nThis somewhat long dissertation upon the nature and development of the\r\nconfederation formed by Philip’s II revolted subjects in Flanders is\r\nnot a digression beside the mark. The number of Huguenots to be found\r\nin the Low Countries in 1566-67, intriguing with their coreligionists\r\nagainst Spain was very great. The duke of Bouillon and the prince\r\nof Porcien were the most prominent of these.[1082] In the aggregate\r\nthe number was so great and their participation so serious a matter\r\nfor the government, that the maintenance of the frontier against the\r\nFrench was urged upon Alva as the first necessity, immediately after\r\nhis arrival at Brussels.[1083] France for her own part began to erect\r\na citadel at Verdun and to strengthen the Picard frontier, whose towns\r\nreceived new troops in June, and when word came that there were German\r\ntroops in Luxembourg awaiting Alva’s arrival, D’Andelot was sent to\r\nthe frontier of Champagne with 6,000 Swiss which the government had\r\nlevied.[1084] This action ruffled Philip II’s temper, for to him it was\r\nflaunting his failure to break the alliance of the Swiss with France\r\nin his very face. His ambassador in France protested energetically and\r\ncharged the queen with duplicity.[1085] At Madrid the nuncio inquired\r\nwith curiosity of Fourquevaux, in what spirit Philip II—who had had\r\nan audience with the ambassador the day before—received the news of\r\nFrance’s activities in Switzerland. “I told him,” wrote the ambassador\r\nto Charles IX, “that it was the usage and custom of great kings and\r\nprinces whenever they saw their neighbors arming, to assure themselves\r\nalso of their realms and states.”[1086] Calais was a double source of\r\nanxiety, first because Spain, in pursuance of Alva’s recommendation,\r\nhad not been content with fortifying Gravelines, but had actually built\r\na fort of earth only five paces from the turnpike which marked the\r\nFrench limit; secondly, because at this embarrassing time Elizabeth\r\nof England had conceived the thought of reviving the English claim to\r\nCalais.[1087] With the purpose of fathoming her son-in-law’s designs\r\nCatherine sent the younger L’Aubespine to Madrid.[1088] War with Spain\r\nwas already on the lips of some in France.[1089]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the wisdom of these military precautions on the part of\r\nthe French crown, the Huguenots grew alarmed lest there was a movement\r\non foot to repress the edict.[1090] There was designed intention in\r\nthe unadmirable conduct of the prince of Condé, and perhaps some in\r\nthat of Coligny too. The prince craved chief command of the army, and\r\na war with Spain was in a direct line with his aspirations. He had\r\nbeen well treated since the peace of Amboise, having been given the\r\ngovernment of Picardy and the county of Rotrou, which was erected\r\ninto a duchy under the name of Enghien-le-François. But his appetite\r\nfor power was insatiable. In July, after angry speech with the King,\r\nCondé had retired from court, and was followed by the admiral, who gave\r\nout that he had discovered “some practice that wholly tended to his\r\nconfusion.”[1091]\r\n\r\nIt was small politics. In this time of external danger from the\r\nfurtive designs of Philip II and the blustering enmity of England,\r\nthe honorable course of every subject of France was to stand by the\r\nKing and the nation. The Huguenot leaders compromised the cause at\r\nlarge by indulging their personal vanity, their petty spite, their\r\npique at such an hour. Friction there was, disagreement there was over\r\nthe interpretation and the working of certain parts of the edict of\r\nAmboise. The Catholics, for example, complained that the intention of\r\nthe edict was evaded by the Huguenots, asserting that in cases where\r\nthe right of preaching was permitted to all barons and high justiciars\r\nonly for themselves and their tenants, and for others of lower degree\r\nfor their household only, congregational worship was held under cover\r\nthereof.[1092]\r\n\r\nThe bigotry of Paris and its vicinity, though, was the worst source\r\nof disaffection. In the city district captains were chosen by the\r\npopulace to watch against Protestant activity—the nucleus of the\r\nfamous Sixteen (_Seize_) of Paris in 1589-94. It would have been the\r\nheight of political inexpediency, under such circumstances, to have\r\ntried to enforce the letter of the edict in the Ile-de-France. The July\r\namendment of the edict of Amboise prohibiting exercise of Protestant\r\nworship throughout the Ile-de-France except in such places as should\r\nbe licensed by the King, and the further one prohibiting Protestants\r\nfrom filling public offices in the cities,[1093] I believe was framed\r\nfor the purpose of avoiding conflict and not with any reactionary\r\npurpose. It is certainly of significance that the liberal chancellor\r\nL’Hôpital favored them.[1094] Patience and experience would have worked\r\nout the solution of such difficulties as these. It was criminal in\r\nthe prince of Condé to fan the ashes of the late civil war into flame\r\nonce more. For in this tense state the prince deliberately exaggerated\r\nand misrepresented things for his own purpose and a spark from\r\nFlanders—Alva’s arrest of the counts Egmont and Hoorne on September\r\n9—kindled France into flame again.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the news in France unfortunately coincided with the\r\nsession of two synods of the Huguenots, one at Châtillon-sur-Loing,\r\nthe other at Valéry.[1095] Dismay prevailed in them. The preachers\r\ncried out that the arrest of Egmont and Hoorne[1096] was the proof\r\nof a secret alliance between Spain and France for the overthrow of\r\nCalvinism. The truth of Bayonne was out at last! Coligny’s iron will\r\nmight still have kept them in order, however, if in the midst of this\r\nexcitement word had not also come that 6,000 Swiss whom Charles IX had\r\nenrolled to cover the French frontier against the duke of Alva had\r\nentered France. The double news was too much for the excited minds of\r\nthe Huguenots. The admiral and the prince who had failed to perceive\r\nthe true policy of France in Switzerland, in desperation turned to the\r\nconstable for a word of truth and comfort. But the old Montmorency,\r\nwho desired to have his son, the marshal Montmorency, succeed him in\r\nthe office of constable[1097] (which the prince of Condé coveted for\r\nhimself), roughly rejoined: “The Swiss have their pay; don’t you expect\r\nthem to be used?”[1098] The words were brutally and thoughtlessly said.\r\nThey merely imported anger. The Huguenots interpreted them to mean that\r\nthey were to be overcome by military force, and Protestantism coerced,\r\nif not extinguished. The synod of the Huguenots at Valéry[1099]\r\nresolved upon war. The conference was held in the admiral’s château\r\nat Châtillon under the outward guise of a banquet. There were present\r\nthe prince of Condé, La Rochefoucault, the cardinal of Châtillon,\r\nD’Andelot, Bricquemault, Teligny, Mouy, Montgomery, and other nobles of\r\nmark, besides some Huguenot ministers. The conference lasted the entire\r\nweek, at the end of which it was resolved that all the Huguenots in\r\nFrance should be notified in every _bailliage_ and _sénéschaussée_, by\r\nthe deacons and other officers of their congregation; that they should\r\nbe called upon to furnish money according to the means which they had,\r\nfor the payment of reiters from Germany, which the count palatine of\r\nthe Rhine was to levy; and that all the young men of the religion\r\ncapable of bearing arms were to be enrolled for military service.[1100]\r\n\r\nThe plan was as bold as it was simple. It was to gain possession of the\r\nKing’s person by a sudden _coup de main_, for which purpose a force\r\nof 1,500 horse was to be brought secretly to Valéry. The court at\r\nthis time was residing at the Château de Monceaux near Meaux, and was\r\nwithout more than nominal military protection.[1101] On the evening\r\nof September 24, the queen learned of the rendezvous at Rosay-en-Brie.\r\nA midnight council was called. The Swiss, who had reached Château\r\nThierry, were hastily summoned. The Lorraine party and the duke\r\nof Nemours advised immediate return to Paris. The chancellor and\r\nMontmorency endeavored to persuade the King against so doing.[1102] The\r\nformer pointed out that to go to Paris would be for the King to commit\r\nhimself to the most bigoted of his subjects and destroy the possibility\r\nof an amicable settlement, while the constable argued that Meaux was a\r\nfortified city capable of withstanding a siege, and that to leave it\r\nmight be to court defeat in the open country. In the dilemma the Swiss\r\ncolonel Pfiffer cast the die.\r\n\r\n“May it please your Majesty,” cried he, “to entrust your person and\r\nthat of the queen mother to the valor and fidelity of the Swiss. We are\r\n6,000 men, and with the points of our pikes we will open a path wide\r\nenough for you to pass through the army of your enemies.”[1103]\r\n\r\n“Enough,” Charles rejoined. “I would rather die free with you than live\r\na captive among rebels.”[1104]\r\n\r\nThe return to Paris began at four o’clock in the morning. “When the\r\nSwiss arrived at Meaux,” wrote Correro, “I vow they were the most\r\nvillainous looking gang I have ever seen. Yet in battle array they were\r\nadmirable. Three times they turned upon the enemy and lowering their\r\npikes charged upon them like savage dogs in serried ranks and in good\r\norder, without one being a pace in advance of another. Thus the King\r\nwas able with his suite to get to Paris.”[1105] He reached the Louvre\r\nthat night, travel-worn, hot, famished, and so angry that his fierce\r\ndisposition never lost the memory of that humiliation.[1106]\r\n\r\nThe affair of Meaux came like a thunder-clap to most of France. The\r\nsuddenness of the Huguenot action and the all but complete success of\r\nit astonished men. “This movement,” wrote the Venetian ambassador,\r\n“of which several thousand men had knowledge, was conducted with such\r\nprecaution that nothing leaked out until it was all but an accomplished\r\nfact. This could not possibly have been done without the perfect\r\nintelligence that exists among the Huguenots, and is a striking\r\nmanifestation of their organization throughout the realm.”[1107]\r\n\r\nIn the light of this judgment, it remains to describe the Huguenot form\r\nof government.\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical—and political unit—of French Calvinism was the\r\ncongregation. Congregations were grouped “according to number and\r\nconvenience” into colloquies or classes which met from two to four\r\ntimes each year, the division being made by the authority of the\r\nprovincial synod.[1108] In church matters, no church had any primacy\r\nor jurisdiction over another, nor one province over another.[1109]\r\nMinisters brought with them to local classes or provincial synods\r\none or two elders chosen out of their consistories.[1110] Elders\r\nwho were deputies of churches had an equal power of voting with the\r\npastors.[1111] The authority of a provincial synod was subordinate\r\nto that of the national synod,[1112] and whatever had been decreed\r\nby provincial synods for the government of the churches in their\r\nprovince had to be brought before the national synod.[1113] The\r\ngrand lines of division followed the historic provincial divisions\r\nof France, but smaller provinces and parts of the larger ones, as\r\nGuyenne and Languedoc, were associated together. The national synod\r\nof 1559 divided France into sixteen Protestant provinces, as follows:\r\n(1) The Ile-de-France, Chartrain, Picardy, Champagne and Brie; (2)\r\nNormandy; (3) Brittany; (4) Orleans, Blesois, Dunois, Nivernais, Berry,\r\nBourbonnais, and La Marche; (5) Touraine, Anjou, Loudunois, Maine,\r\nVendôme, and Perche; (6) Upper and Lower Poitou; (7) Saintonge, Aunis,\r\nLa Rochelle, and Angoumois; (8) Lower Guyenne, Périgord, Gascony,\r\nand Limousin; (9) Upper and Lower Vivarais, together with Velay,\r\nand Le Forêt; (10) Lower Languedoc, including Nîmes, Montpellier,\r\nand Beziers; (11) Upper Languedoc, Upper Guyenne, Toulouse,\r\nCarcassonne, Quercy, Rouergue, Armagnac, and Upper Auvergne; (12)\r\nBurgundy, Lyonnais, Beaujolais, Bresse, Lower Auvergne, and Gex; (13)\r\nProvence; (14) Dauphiné and Orange; (15) Béarn; (16) the Cevennes and\r\nGévaudan.[1114]\r\n\r\nThis administrative partition, however, did not remain fixed. Some\r\nprovinces, like Brittany, had so few Protestants in them, that the\r\nHuguenots therein could not stand alone, and the first civil war\r\nbrought out the weakness of this system. Accordingly, in 1563, the map\r\nof France was partitioned anew, and the former sixteen “provinces”\r\nwere reduced to nine. Some of the changes made are interesting. For\r\nexample, the Chartrain was cut off from the Ile-de-France and attached\r\nto the “province” of Orleans, manifestly in the endeavor to keep a\r\nconnecting link between Normandy and the Loire country. Brittany was\r\nstrengthened by the annexation of Anjou, Maine, and Touraine which\r\nformerly constituted an independent “province,” which obviously drew\r\nit into closer connection with the stronger Calvinistic provinces.\r\nThe “province” of Upper and Lower Poitou was combined with Saintonge,\r\nAunis, and Angoumois, thus knitting together all the country watered\r\nby the Charente, the Clain, and lesser streams. Burgundy, Lyonnais,\r\nBeaujolais, Bresse, Lower Auvergne, and Gex absorbed the small\r\nHuguenot province composed of Vivarais, Velay, and Le Forêt. But the\r\nmost interesting consolidation was in the south of France. Formerly\r\nUpper Languedoc, in which were Nîmes, Montpellier, and Beziers;\r\nLower Languedoc, comprising Upper Guyenne, Toulouse, Carcassonne,\r\nQuercy, Rouergue, Armagnac, and Upper Auvergne; Provence; Dauphiné,\r\nand Cevennes-Gévaudan had each formed separate “provinces.” But in\r\n1563 this immense territory was all united to form the great Huguenot\r\nprovince of Languedoc. The only ancient provinces which remained\r\nunchanged in 1563 were Normandy,[1115] Béarn, and Lower Guyenne, with\r\nPérigord and Limousin.\r\n\r\nThe Huguenot ecclesiastical organization and its political organization\r\nwere one and the same. The congregations, the “colloquia,” the synods,\r\nconstituted both taxation units and military _cadres_.[1116] The\r\nstrength of the Huguenot organization, however, before the massacre\r\nof St. Bartholomew, I believe has been exaggerated, except in Guyenne\r\nwhere, in the vicinity of Nérac especially, Montluc early came in\r\ncontact with a powerful combination of the Huguenots.[1117] The strong\r\nelements in the Protestant organization were its simplicity and the\r\nvigilance of all, from provincial chiefs to simple pastors, who\r\nmade up for scarcity of numbers by the most zealous activity.[1118]\r\n“If our priests,” wrote the Venetian Correro in 1569, “were half\r\nso energetic, of a certainty Christianity would not be in danger\r\nin this country.”[1119] It was not until after 1572 that the\r\nHuguenot organization reached a high point of military and political\r\ndevelopment, when a solid federation of the Reformed churches was\r\nformed at Milhaud in 1574, with rating precincts, military hundreds and\r\ncivil jurisdictions.[1120]\r\n\r\nExactly as the early organization of the Huguenots has been\r\noveremphasized, so has the republican nature of the early Huguenot\r\nmovement been exaggerated. Apart from whatever religious motives may\r\nhave actuated them, the Protestant nobles were influenced by political\r\nambition; the bourgeoisie by the hope of administrative and economic\r\nreform; the masses by the general spirit of discontent. The Huguenots\r\ndid not present a united front until after St. Bartholomew, when\r\nthe fusion of the political Huguenots with the Politiques reduced\r\nthe “religious” Huguenots to a left-wing minority. Before 1572 the\r\npolitical ideas of the Reformed, if not still inchoate, were not\r\nharmonized into one homogeneous cause, backed up by a compact and\r\nhighly organized political system. Individual political theorists or\r\nfanatic devotees, of course, were to be found in the Huguenot ranks,\r\nbut there was no systematic political philosophy to guide their conduct\r\nbefore the massacre of St. Bartholomew. It was this catastrophe that\r\ncrystallized Huguenot opinion and organized combination on a large\r\nscale.[1121] In Guyenne, alone, where, as has been said, the Huguenot\r\norganization was most completely developed at an early date, does any\r\nclear republican idea seem to have early obtained.[1122]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND CIVIL WAR (1567-68)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this wise, after a respite of four years, the second civil war was\r\nprecipitated. There was an exodus of Huguenots at once from Paris, some\r\nrepairing to the prince of Condé, some to the duke de Rohan, others\r\nto Montgomery in Lower Normandy where a war of the partisans began at\r\nonce.[1123] The capital was in a furious mood and the King’s presence\r\nalone prevented the Parisians from massacring the Protestants there and\r\nthe Montmorencys.[1124]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PARIS AND ITS FAUBOURGS IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY]\r\n\r\nThe chief effort of the Huguenots was to seize the towns on the\r\nSeine above and below Paris, in order to stay provisions, and so to\r\ncompel the government to submit.[1125] The capture of the Pont de\r\nCharenton[1126] by Condé’s forces was a heavy blow to the government,\r\nas Charenton chiefly supplied Paris with wheat and flour. The Parisians\r\nfully expected to be attacked and made preparations therefor by\r\nbreaking up the stones in the streets and piling them in heaps for\r\nready service or taking them into their houses; at the same time they\r\ndestroyed pent-houses and other similar insignificant structures\r\nin order that they might the better hurl their missiles.[1127] So\r\nsuddenly had the war been begun that the blockade of Paris for the\r\ntime being was almost complete. Lagny on the Marne,[1128] Charenton,\r\nPorchefontaine, Busanval, Argenteuil, St. Ouen, Ambervilliers, and St.\r\nDenis constituted the inner zone of Huguenot control while farther out\r\nMontereau on the highroad to Sens, Etampes on the road to Orleans and\r\nin the heart of the wheat district that supplied the capital,[1129]\r\nDourdan at the junction of the Blois-Chartres roads, and Dreux on the\r\nroad toward Normandy, formed an outer circle. So closely was Paris\r\ninvested that the windmills in the faubourgs of St. Denis, St. Honoré,\r\nand Port St. Martin were burned by the Huguenots. The churches for\r\nleagues around were plundered of copes, chasubles, tunics, and other\r\nrich silk and satin garments. The Huguenot gentry made shirts and\r\nhandkerchiefs out of the lace and linen of the clergy. But all gold\r\nand silver taken, as altar-vessels, crosses, chalices, were turned into\r\nthe general spoil for the sake of the cause.[1130] Forced loans were\r\nimposed upon small merchants and even the peasantry were constrained to\r\nforced labor,[1131] so that the latter fled by hundreds to Paris.\r\n\r\nThe ravages of the Huguenots were so great that they defeated the very\r\npurpose they had in mind. For thousands of the peasantry, under cover\r\nof a liberal ordinance intended to provision Paris,[1132] drove their\r\ncattle into the city and carted thither the grain and provisions they\r\nhad stored up against the winter, where they sold it cheap, rather\r\nthan see it destroyed by “volleurs quilz pillent et brulent granges,\r\nmaisons, moulins et font tout le mal qu’ilz peullent faire.”[1133]\r\nWine, meat, and bread were not dear in Paris; beechnut oil and oats\r\nwere at a reasonable price.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLOCKADE OF PARIS\r\n\r\nby the Huguenots\r\n\r\nOCT.-NOV. 1567\r\n\r\nHuguenot positions ...\r\n\r\n  _Methuen & Co_\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUGUENOT MARCH TO PONT-à-MOUSSON after the battle of\r\nS^[T]. DENIS\r\n\r\n  _Methuen & Co._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe queen mother, who looked to Alva for the most immediate aid,[1134]\r\nsent the chancellor L’Hôpital, the liberal marshal Vieilleville, and\r\nJean de Morvilliers, bishop of Orleans, to confer with the prince of\r\nCondé in order to gain time. But the prince was so elated with his\r\nsuccessful blockade of Paris that his demands rose in degree, and could\r\nnot be accepted by the government. Yet the nature of these demands is\r\nto be observed, for it is evidence of the fact that the conflict was\r\nbecoming more and more a _political_ one, and that the religious issue,\r\nif not a minor issue, at least was but an element in the programme of\r\nthe Huguenots. Moreover, these demands are interesting for the reason\r\nthat they represent a new stage in the evolution of the struggle and\r\nthat henceforth they are a permanent contention of the Huguenots and\r\nultimately are embodied in the Edict of Toleration. The prince, whose\r\nchief object was to overthrow the Guises and get the government of the\r\nKing and the management of affairs into his own hands[1135] insisted on\r\nthe free exercise of religion throughout the realm without limitation\r\nor distinction of places or persons; that all taxes lately authorized\r\nshould be remitted and all new forms of taxation imposed since the\r\nreign of Louis XII abolished; that an accounting be made of the money\r\ngranted for defraying the King’s debts; that all those who had been\r\ndeposed from their offices on account of religion should be reinstated;\r\nand that four fortified towns be placed in his hands as security for\r\nthe good intentions of the crown. Furthermore, the prince demanded the\r\ndismissal of the Swiss and Spanish regiments.[1136]\r\n\r\nIn due time the prince of Condé discovered that delay was disastrous.\r\nAlthough his force had daily increased by new accessions from the\r\nsouth,[1137] nevertheless the Huguenot position was not so strong\r\nas it appeared. Paris rallied to the cause of the King and gave him\r\n400,000 écus, while the clergy advanced 250,000.[1138] The duke of\r\nGuise was in Champagne with troops of Champagne and Burgundy, besides\r\neight companies of men-at-arms.[1139] Moreover, recruits were pouring\r\nin to help the King, some from the duke of Savoy,[1140] some from\r\nPiedmont under command of Strozzi, whose approach the admiral and De\r\nMouy tried to prevent, and some from Pope Pius V, who bestirred himself\r\nin behalf of France as soon as he was informed of the renewal of\r\nhostilities once more.[1141] The Huguenots made strenuous efforts to\r\nbreak the Swiss alliance and to persuade the Protestant Swiss cantons\r\nto withdraw. But fortunately for the French crown, the cantons remained\r\nfirm, for without the assistance of Swiss troops, Charles IX would have\r\nbeen hard put to it for an army, for he dared not accept the all too\r\ninterested offers of Philip II.[1142] As in the first civil war, both\r\nparties looked to Germany for assistance[1143] and the queen mother\r\nsent Lignerolles “to practice the stay of the reiters, and on his\r\nreturn, to the count palatine to desire him not to succor the prince\r\nand his associates, affirming that their rising was not of any zeal of\r\nreligion, but only to rebel against their prince.”[1144] The Huguenots\r\nalso made overtures to Philip II’s revolted subjects.[1145]\r\n\r\nBy the middle of October the prince of Condé discovered that he was\r\nlying between two enemies, Paris and the new troops coming up, and\r\nevery day added to his peril. There can be little doubt but that the\r\nqueen mother purposely protracted the negotiations, knowing that by so\r\ndoing Condé’s security would be diminished. Signs were not wanting to\r\nindicate that matters were coming to a head. On October 7 the King sent\r\na herald to the prince to proclaim that all who were with him should\r\nunarm and repair to Paris, whereby they might save their lives and\r\ngoods, which, if they refused to do so, should be confiscated.\r\n\r\n The same day the constable declared how the King, trusting to bring\r\n certain of his subjects to good conformity by his clemency, had sent\r\n his chancellor to assure them that his edicts made for religion and\r\n pacification should be inviolably kept, and that no man should be\r\n molested for the same; and that touching other small articles he was\r\n in full mind to have satisfied them. Notwithstanding, they would not\r\n submit themselves to any reason; wherefore the King was fully resolved\r\n to declare them rebels and prosecute them accordingly, for the\r\n maintenance whereof he would venture both body and goods. On October\r\n 8 proclamation was made that if the prince with his associates would\r\n submit themselves to the King within three days he would freely pardon\r\n all that was past; but if they refused, they were to be accounted as\r\n rebels and it was to be lawful to all the King’s subjects to kill\r\n all such as they should find armed. In expectation of battle, the\r\n constable was made lieutenant-general of the King’s army.[1146]\r\n\r\nYet despite the precariousness of his situation the prince was still\r\nconfident. His pride was hardened by the capture of Orleans by La\r\nNoue on September 28,[1147] and of Soissons.[1148] He enlarged the\r\nProtestants’ demands, requiring that Calais, Boulogne, and Metz[1149]\r\nbe delivered to them as surety, that the King disarm first and that\r\none church of every “good town” in France be permitted to those of the\r\nreligion; and that 300,000 francs be granted the prince to pay his\r\ntroops, “whereby they may return hence without pillage.”[1150] The\r\ncrown scornfully rejected the terms and assumed a rapid offensive. On\r\nthe night of November 6 Strozzi’s band destroyed a bridge of boats\r\nplanked together which the prince had made in order more effectually\r\nto cut off Paris; on the following day another point on the river\r\nwhich threatened Paris was captured by the duke of Nemours, and on\r\nthe 9th Condé was compelled to withdraw from Charenton after breaking\r\nthe bridge and firing the town. On November 8 the prince had made the\r\nblunder of weakening his main force by sending D’Andelot to seize\r\nPoissy and Montgomery to get possession of Pontoise, the two open\r\nplaces in the inner zone of steel drawn around Paris.[1151] The crisis\r\nof real battle came in their absence, on November 10, the battle of St.\r\nDenis. It was a fierce and bloody fray beginning about 3 o’clock and\r\nlasting till dark, in which both sides suffered severely. Montmorency,\r\n“more famous than fortunate in arms,” was twice slashed in the face by\r\na cutlass and then shot in the neck and the small of his back by pistol\r\nbullets fired by the Scotch captain named Robert Stuart[1152] serving\r\nwith the Huguenots. The old veteran, thinking his assailant did not\r\nrecognize him, cried out: “You do not know me. I am the constable.”\r\nBut the Scot, as he fired, replied: “Because I know you, I give you\r\nthis!”[1153] Though the white-liveried horsemen of Condé passed through\r\nand through the King’s soldiery and though the constable was mortally\r\nwounded the battle was not won by the prince.[1154] On November 14\r\nthe Huguenot army filed out of St. Denis “without sound of trumpet\r\nor stroke of drum.” The prince established temporary headquarters at\r\nMontereau toward Sens, but later moved up the Marne to the vicinity of\r\nTroyes with the duke of Guise following slowly after him, in order to\r\neffect a junction with the reiters of duke Casimir of the Palatinate,\r\nwhich the government was unable to prevent.[1155]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BATTLE OF ST. DENIS\r\n\r\nFrom photograph of the original sketch, probably made by the son of Sir\r\nHenry Norris, English ambassador in France. Original in Public Record\r\nOffice, State Papers, Foreign, Elizabeth, Vol. XCV, No. 1813. It is\r\ndated November 10, 1567, and measures 31½ × 23⅛\r\n\r\nThe presence of the Huguenot forces seemed like the return of the\r\nreiters to the folk in Champagne, who hid their treasures in stables,\r\ngardens, chimneys, and the like. Some concealed their money and jewels\r\nin crannies in the walls; others hid them in the swaddling clothes of\r\nbabes. But even this was to no purpose, for the soldiers plucked the\r\nchildren from the very breasts of their mothers and stripped them in\r\norder to find what was hidden upon them.[1156]\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of St. Denis two opinions divided the King’s council.\r\nSome urged the queen, who was at Fontainebleau, to make new overtures;\r\nothers, who reflected the opinion of Paris, were for pursuing the war.\r\nThe queen mother acted upon the first suggestion, but nothing came\r\nof the overtures because the King insisted upon disarmament of the\r\nHuguenots before considering their terms.[1157] Active preparations\r\nwere therefore made to push the war in the provinces, somewhat to the\r\nsurprise of the Catholic gentry who had thought it was finished on the\r\nfield of St. Denis.[1158] Camps of artillery, the infantry, and the\r\nSwiss were established at Voulton, St. Martin-des-Champs, Gymbrois,\r\nand other points in Champagne and Brie, while the cavalry was lodged\r\nin other parishes. Garrisons were also posted in the châteaux and\r\n_maisons fortes_ of the Huguenots in the region. Without counting the\r\nterritory covered by the advance guard of the King’s army, a strip of\r\nterritory was occupied over ten miles long and six wide, and containing\r\nmore than fifty thousand persons.[1159] For the feeding of this host,\r\nan ordinance of the master of the camp ordered the seizure of all\r\nthe local bakeries, the necessary grain being commandeered from the\r\nmerchants and farmers of the locality. Besides these provisions the\r\nsoldiery, since they were quartered on households, freely consumed\r\nbread, meat, wine, and other food where they were, without payment.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the King’s troops was a heavy drain upon the resources\r\nof the region, more especially since the summer had been so dry that\r\nthe crops were thin. Indeed so great was the drought that even swamps\r\ngrew dry and there were public prayers and processions for rain in all\r\nthe parishes of France. Fortunately rain fell in time to save the vines\r\nso that the wine did not fail, else the condition of France would have\r\nbeen one of great distress.[1160]\r\n\r\nOn November 20 two thousand horsemen arrived in Paris from Flanders.\r\nThe hope of the French Protestants was chiefly pinned upon John Casimir\r\nof the Palatinate, son of the elector Frederick, and a force of German\r\nreiters, the expectation of whose coming had induced Condé to move\r\neastward toward Troyes. The count palatine drew a sharp line in his own\r\nmind between religion and politics. He would have been quick to resent\r\nany invasion of his rights as a ruler. But he did not understand French\r\npolitics, and looked upon the Huguenot movement as a purely religious\r\none to which he felt bound to give support because he was a zealous\r\nProtestant.[1161] The French government sent the bishop of Rennes and\r\nLignerolles to endeavor to dissuade the count palatine; they affirmed\r\nthat the rebellion of Condé was not for any zeal of religion but for\r\npolitical advantage. But the prince’s emissary outmatched the bishop\r\nand his colleague, assuring the count palatine that the sole cause of\r\nthe Huguenot insurrection was the preservation of the free exercise\r\nof religion, together with their honor, lives, and goods.[1162] The\r\nargument of Charles IX that the estate of himself and realm was so\r\nintermingled with that of religion that the count palatine could\r\nnot touch one without offense to the other, was not convincing to\r\nCasimir.[1163]\r\n\r\nTo add to Catherine’s anxiety the Emperor revived the old project to\r\nseize the Three Bishoprics,[1164] a project made doubly dangerous by\r\nthe new machinations of the cardinal of Lorraine. For, in order to\r\nsafeguard the Catholic cause in France and to save Metz from being lost\r\nentirely after the Huguenots had captured the citadel in October, the\r\ncardinal of Lorraine, had resumed his secret negotiations with Spain.\r\nInstead, however, of writing direct to Philip II he wrote to Alva,\r\nfor time was pressing and the danger great. On November 1, 1567, a\r\nchaplain of the cardinal appeared before the duke in Antwerp bearing\r\na letter imploring Alva to come to the assistance of the French crown\r\nand offered to put him in possession of certain places in France. At\r\nfirst Alva was so incredulous that he imprisoned the bearer[1165]\r\nuntil he was satisfied of the verity of his mission. Nevertheless he\r\nimmediately sent 3,000 horsemen into the country of Seyn (between Wied\r\nand Bas-Isenberg) whose ruler was a pensioner of Spain, ordered count\r\nMansfeldt to go to Luxembourg, and dispatched a message to the margrave\r\nof Baden for 1,000 horsemen with the object of preventing Germans going\r\nto France or the war there from spreading to the Spanish provinces.\r\nFinally, when persuaded of the truth of the cardinal’s overtures, Alva\r\nsaid that if circumstances so developed as to make such action on his\r\npart an imperative duty before the King of France could be apprised, he\r\nwould do so; and that if the King were overwhelmed by the Huguenots, he\r\nwould believe it his duty for the sake of protecting the Catholic faith\r\nto occupy the places offered by the cardinal, which might be held in\r\npawn by Spain as collateral for French repayment of her services.[1166]\r\nBut the treasonable designs of the cardinal of Lorraine went even\r\nfarther than an offer to surrender some of the border fortresses\r\nof France into Spanish hands. As early as this time the possible\r\ndeposition of the house of Valois was contemplated by the Guises in\r\nfavor of the Spanish-Hapsburg dynasty. For the cardinal went on to say\r\nthat in event of the early death of Charles IX and his brothers Philip\r\nII of Spain would be heir to the throne of France through his wife,\r\nElizabeth of Valois. “The Salic law is a pleasantry,” he added, “and\r\nforce of arms could overcome any opposition”![1167] “This last,” wrote\r\nAlva to Philip, “is a different matter and I cannot risk taking a hand\r\nin it without express instructions from your Majesty.”\r\n\r\nThe habitual self-control of the Spanish monarch must have been heavily\r\ntaxed to subdue his emotion when he learned of this astonishing\r\nnegotiation. But he was true to his second-nature. Without apparent\r\nexcitement he endorsed the document thus: “This point is one upon which\r\nmore time is needed to reflect, because it would be difficult to do\r\nwhat the cardinal asks without compromise. On the other hand, it is\r\nhard to decline for such a cause what is thrown into my arms. However,\r\nI think that a decision in this matter is not urgent. Let the duke\r\ninform me what he thinks about it, according to the state of things\r\nthere.”[1168] Was it caution, or hesitation, or procrastination?\r\n\r\nAs an intermediate course, one less compromising and perhaps quite\r\nas effective in the long run, Alva suggested, although with some\r\nmisgiving, to the cardinal of Lorraine that he come in person to\r\nthe relief of the French crown.[1169] While he was debating this\r\nquestion with himself, news came of the battle of St. Denis and of the\r\napproach of the reiters; and hard upon this, word from Catherine de\r\nMedici asking for the aid of 2,000 Spanish arquebusiers against the\r\nreiters.[1170] The duke of Alva, in reply, after chiding Catherine for\r\nnot accepting the offers of assistance he had made immediately after\r\nMeaux,[1171] offered to send 2,000 arquebusiers and 2,000 cavalry—he\r\ncould not now spare the great force he had proffered earlier—to\r\nthe assistance of the duke of Aumale against the reiters,[1172]\r\nalthough admitting, with grim pleasantry, that there was a certain\r\nhumor in casting firebrands into a neighbor’s house when one’s own\r\nwas burning.[1173] But the offer came too late to be of service,\r\nthus fortunately sparing Catherine from the humiliation of having\r\nintroduced in France a power whose purpose was the overthrow of\r\nFrance.[1174]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, while Condé was encamped between Sens[1175] and\r\nTroyes, the reiters had entered Lorraine to the number of about six\r\nthousand.[1176] Their coming thwarted the plans of the duke of Guise,\r\nwho was on the frontier with the marshal Tavannes, for it prevented the\r\nFrench commanders from joining with Count Mansfeldt and the duke of\r\nLorraine and compelled them to fall back.[1177] The junction of Condé\r\nand the reiters was effected on December 28, and a camp established at\r\nDessay. The King’s army of all sorts comprised 30,000 footmen and half\r\nas many horse.[1178] Nevertheless, despite the adverse prospect, the\r\ngovernment did not waver. The capital was intensely loyal. In response\r\nto a call of the King, the Parisians made a general muster of 30,000\r\nand offered 1,200,000 francs for the maintenance of the war.[1179]\r\n\r\nTentative efforts, however, were even yet made to make peace, to the\r\nindignation of the Parisians.[1180] The insistence of Charles IX,\r\nthough, upon an immediate laying-down of arms was an effective obstacle\r\nto any cartel that might have been arranged. In reply to the articles\r\nsent by the King to the prince of Condé, the latter responded that\r\nthe Protestants had no intention to prescribe the law to the King,\r\nbut only humbly to require such things as were necessary for the\r\nliberty of their consciences and the preservation of their lives and\r\ngoods, namely, that the edict of Orleans should be observed without\r\nany alterations; that bailiwicks should be appointed for the free\r\nexercise of religion; that they should be preserved in the enjoyment\r\nof their estates and offices; that those of Lyons should have the same\r\nliberty as the rest of the subjects of the realm; that synods should\r\nbe permitted, and that the Edict of Pacification should be declared\r\nirrevocable.[1181]\r\n\r\nIn his answer Charles IX declared that he would never agree to treat\r\nwith the prince of Condé or any other subject as with an equal; he\r\npromised to pardon what had passed if the Protestants would lay down\r\ntheir arms within three days and retire to their houses and give up the\r\nplaces taken by them; that where certain gentlemen complained of having\r\nbeen prosecuted for exercising their religion in their houses, he was\r\ncontent that this should cease, provided that there were not more than\r\nfifty persons present exclusive of their families; that he intended\r\nto keep his forces in his hands and to dispose of and govern towns as\r\nhe pleased; that the town of Lyons, being full of strangers, should\r\nnot be allowed the exercise of religion; that all enrolment of men,\r\nassociations, and synods, must cease; and finally, that the King would\r\nimmediately dispatch his letters-patent to assure the prince and his\r\ncompany of their lives, goods, and the liberty of their consciences, if\r\nthese conditions were complied with.[1182]\r\n\r\nThe truth is, the French government prepared for war with great\r\nreluctance. Philip II’s anxiety lest the queen would come to terms with\r\nher adversaries was a just one.[1183] The King’s expenses amounted to\r\nnearly a million livres per month,[1184] and he had “to quiet such\r\nstorms as daily arose in his camp amongst his nobility, partly for\r\nreligion and partly for ambition.”[1185] Unless Spain came strongly\r\nto the relief of the Catholic cause in France, it was apparent that\r\nCondé could go almost wherever he pleased in the country, his force was\r\nso great.[1186] Many of the King’s soldiers were ill-minded to fight\r\nagainst their countrymen and many deserted. The Swiss were wearied\r\nby travel and the inclemency of the season and there was much disease\r\namong them.[1187] The leaders wrangled for the command.[1188] There\r\nwas mutiny and desertion in the ranks of the Scotch Guard, thirty\r\nof whom deserted to the prince, or rather to their old commander\r\nMontgomery.[1189] All along the line of the King’s forces there was\r\nopposition to the war. The chevalier Battres told Charles IX that many\r\nof the nobles were determined to hazard the King’s displeasure rather\r\nthan to stain their hands in their kinsmen’s blood.[1190] The marshal\r\nCossé showed unwonted courage in his advocacy of moderation[1191]—a\r\npolicy which he openly admitted and approved in the Council meeting\r\n(February 10). The germ of the Politique party is thus early\r\ndiscoverable.[1192]\r\n\r\nThe duke of Anjou, who had been made commander-in-chief of the Catholic\r\nforces,[1193] seeing the Protestant army considerably augmented and\r\nthat they had crossed the Seine and controlled the passages over\r\nthe Yonne and the Loire, sent most of his troops back to Paris, and\r\nscattered the rest along the banks of the Seine, to guard the road\r\nbetween Troyes and Paris. The Catholic camp in Paris was established in\r\nthe faubourg St. Marceau, where were lodged all the gendarmerie, both\r\nfoot and horse, the artillery and the Swiss. But most of the cavalry\r\nwas quartered in the villages, where the horses could get better\r\ngrazing, to the detriment of the country round about, for the soldiers\r\namused themselves by pillage, so that the better towns and châteaux\r\nwere compelled to fortify themselves as though against the enemy.[1194]\r\nStrenuous efforts were made to provision Paris against a future siege,\r\nand to establish magazines of provisions and ammunition in the towns\r\nof the Ile-de-France and Champagne. To this end the government bought\r\nup grain in the early spring of 1568, paying 50 livres per muid, or 10\r\nsous, 5 deniers, per bichet.[1195]\r\n\r\nAs the prince drew nearer to the city, the conduct of Paris became\r\na matter of anxiety. Although bigotedly Catholic, the populace of\r\nthe capital had no mind to experience another siege in the cause of\r\nreligion, and the popular rage against the government, especially\r\ntoward Catherine de Medici, became so intense that she dared not go\r\nabroad without being heavily guarded. The popular voice claimed that\r\nthe queen mother nourished the quarrel and consumed the revenues of the\r\nKing,[1196] a belief which the Guises cleverly fostered, if they were\r\nnot the immediate authors of it.[1197]\r\n\r\n“The money of the kingdom today is in the hands of a single class,”\r\nwrote the Venetian ambassador. “The clergy is ruined. Without counting\r\nthe property of the church which has been mortgaged or sold with\r\nthe authorization of the Pope, the church since 1561 has paid out\r\n12,000,000 écus for the King. This would be immaterial, for it is but a\r\nseventh of its annual revenue, if the church had not suffered so much\r\nfrom the civil war. The nobles are at their wits’ ends and have not\r\na sou on account of the war. The country folk have been so pillaged\r\nby the soldiery, whose license is frightful, that they are reduced to\r\nbeggary. Only the bourgeoisie and the _gens de robe longue_ still have\r\nmoney. It is difficult for the King to obtain money without force. In\r\naddition to these troubles with his subjects the King has lost all\r\nhis credit with foreign merchants and cannot raise an écu outside\r\nthe kingdom without giving collateral. But good may come out of this\r\ncalamitous state, for the King and his subjects have come to such a\r\ndead stop that peace may result.”[1198]\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the crown earnestly renewed negotiations for\r\npeace. Even astrology was invoked by the superstitious Catherine and\r\nthe signs of the zodiac were sagely said to point toward peace. For\r\nthe queen, walking one day in her garden, discoursing of the peace,\r\ncalled unto her Messire Nonio, an Italian famed for his knowledge of\r\nastrology, of whom she asked what he found by the stars touching peace;\r\nto which he presently answered that the heavens did not promise it, nor\r\nwas the earth yet ready to receive it; since the effect of the eclipse\r\nof the sun was then in its greatest force, and likewise the virtue of\r\nthe conjunction of Saturn and Mars which was in Aries last year; but\r\nthe wise man concluded with the oracular statement that the heavens did\r\nnot _constrain_ the inferior powers but only _disposed_ them.[1199]\r\n\r\nOn February 28 the King sent the marshal Montmorency, Morvilliers,\r\nthe bishop of Limoges, and D’Allny, one of his secretaries, to\r\nconfer with representatives appointed by the prince of Condé, the\r\ncardinal Châtillon, the bishop of Valence, and Teligny at Longjumeau.\r\nThe prince made two notable conditions to the demands already\r\noutlined—that all the articles, agreements, and capitulations should\r\nbe confirmed by _all_ the Parlements of the realm, and that certain\r\ncautionary towns—he named Boulogne or La Rochelle[1200]—be given to\r\nthe Protestants as guarantees of the just purposes of the government.\r\nThese two demands are of interest because they became invariable\r\ndemands of the Huguenots in the future and foreshadowed important terms\r\nin the edict of Bergerac (1576) and that of Nantes of 1598. Those\r\nof the King replied that to make such demands impugned the King’s\r\nhonor, that the prince of Condé ought to trust the crown without\r\nrequiring guaranties of assurance. As to the particular demands,\r\nCharles IX declared he did not think it meet to make the edict of\r\n1563 perpetual[1201] and protested against the political and military\r\norganization of the Protestants, “insomuch as this liberty remaining,\r\nthe King shall never be assured in his realm.” On March 4 the\r\ncommissioners of the prince, tired of the parleying and vexed at the\r\ndiversion the King tried to introduce by proposing a double alliance\r\nbetween the warring houses in the marriage of the duke of Guise with\r\nthe prince’s eldest daughter, and of D’Andelot’s eldest son to the\r\nduke’s sister, demanded express answer regarding church edifices;\r\nbetter observance of the edict by the King’s officers; Huguenot\r\nschools, etc. To these Charles IX assented and the Huguenots waived\r\nthe matter of confirmation by provincial Parlements and the surrender\r\nof certain cautionary places for the time being. It remained to settle\r\nthe question of the reiters’ pay. Five hundred thousand livres in the\r\nroyal chest at Amboise were appropriated by the crown and the balance\r\nof the obligation was provided for by the cardinal of Bourbon and the\r\ndukes of Montmorency and Longueville, who went security for it.[1202]\r\n\r\nAs finally concluded on March 26 the terms of Longjumeau were in\r\nreality a confirmation of the edict of March, 1563, which was not\r\nenlarged as the prince of Condé had at first demanded, except that the\r\nedict in its new form also applied to Provence.[1203] The terms of\r\nLongjumeau were suppressed for a short time and the army not dismissed,\r\nhowever, because it was thought perilous to disarm until the reiters\r\nhad taken their leave. These marauders, who followed war as a trade\r\nand with whom faith and piety were not virtues, had not ceased their\r\ndepredations during the course of the negotiations. The people “being\r\neverywhere environed both with their own or foreign enemies, dared\r\nnot approach town or village, all being replenished with reiters or\r\nthose who entreated them as ill, whereby they miserably died in the\r\nfields.”[1204]\r\n\r\nThe publication of the edict encountered bitter opposition throughout\r\nthe country.[1205] At Toulouse the King’s messenger who brought the\r\nroyal order for its registration by the Parlement was actually tried,\r\ncondemned, and executed for the “offense,” so inflamed was the public\r\nmind.[1206] At Rouen a furious multitude assailed the magistrates and\r\nmobbed the dwellings of those of Huguenot inclination. The same thing\r\nhappened at Bourges. At Orleans the soldiers murdered several at the\r\ngates of the city, with impunity. In Languedoc there were commotions\r\nand slaughters.[1207]\r\n\r\nThe strife in the south of France, in Provence, Languedoc, and Guyenne,\r\nhad never entirely ceased since the inception of the first civil war.\r\nThe King’s tour of the provinces had overawed the combatants to a\r\ncertain extent and in Languedoc Damville, who had succeeded his father\r\non April 28, 1563,[1208] managed to keep things with a pretty even\r\nhand, enforcing the edict of Amboise throughout his jurisdiction.[1209]\r\nBut the hostility of Montluc, whose government of Guyenne adjoined\r\nLanguedoc, toward Damville, was a serious bar to pacification, for\r\nMontluc not only sought to diminish Damville’s authority by complaining\r\nto the King of him, but also secretly connived with the doings of\r\nultra-Catholic partisans in Toulouse and elsewhere.[1210]\r\n\r\nSo intense was the hatred in the south of France between the Catholics\r\nand the Huguenots that there was scarce any intermission of hostilities\r\nat all after the peace of Longjumeau, especially in Provence. The\r\nduke of Joyeuse, who commanded the royal forces here, was a man after\r\nMontluc’s own heart. Early in 1568 he had passed up the Rhone for the\r\npurpose of aiding the counts of Tende and Suze. He had with him 2,000\r\nfoot and from five to six hundred horse, and easily overcame the little\r\nfortresses until he reached Pont St. Esprit in February. Failing to\r\ntake this, the army was divided. Joyeuse crossed the Rhone at Avignon\r\non March 7, took Loudun, Orsenne, and Tresques, then, retracing his\r\nsteps, he again joined the count of Tende and renewed the siege of\r\nPont St. Esprit. The Protestants under the command of Montbrun gave\r\nbattle in the plains of Montfran near Aramon, and were badly defeated\r\nMay 24, 1568. When peace was made Joyeuse returned to Avignon. Most\r\nof the towns of lower Languedoc were carefully garrisoned by him, but\r\nMontauban, Castres, and Montpellier resisted. Everywhere he exacted\r\ndisarmament and the oath of fidelity.[1211]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD CIVIL WAR (1568). NEW CATHOLIC LEAGUE. THE BATTLE OF JARNAC\r\n\r\n\r\nThe peace of Longjumeau, more than any treaty of the civil wars, was\r\na tentative settlement, an armistice merely. It was chiefly compelled\r\nby the lack of funds of both parties and from its signature was more\r\nopenly opposed and protested against than any other of the treaties.\r\nSuspense over the probability of a third and worse war prevailed from\r\nthe beginning. For while many on each side returned to their homes,\r\nthere were many others who had no place to which to retire, for whom\r\nvagabond life had attractions and who preferred war to peace and\r\nplundering to honest labor.[1212] Both sides were too suspicious and\r\ntoo fearful to lay down their arms. So many of the Huguenot captains\r\nkept their troops in the fields that the King wrote to no less than\r\n212 places charging the governors thereof to scatter these bands.\r\nMany known to have been in arms hid them in secret places and were,\r\nin consequence, not permitted to return to their native places until\r\nsuch arms were given up. The Catholic resentment seems to have been\r\nstrongest in Paris[1213] and Burgundy, though in the former the provost\r\nof the merchants made the singularly sane plea to the King to have an\r\nespecial regard for justice lest its denial might stir the Protestants\r\nto new strife. In general, though, wherever the King’s garrisons were\r\nstationed there was trouble.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the Guise opposition organized. Failing of\r\ntheir hold upon Charles IX, the Guises directed their efforts upon\r\nhis brother, Henry, duke of Anjou, whose Catholic sentiments[1214]\r\nwere less impeachable than those of Charles and who began to “show\r\nsome tokens of an ambitious heart,” was a sworn Catholic, and showed\r\ngreat offense at his royal brother’s action in “very courteously”\r\nentertaining the cardinal Châtillon, the count Rochefoucauld, and\r\nBrocarde, the Protestant governor of Orleans.[1215] On the night of\r\nMarch 29 a secret conference was held at the Louvre of the leaders\r\namong the Guise party, in which it was proposed that a pacific attitude\r\nbe pretended until the disarming of the prince of Condé’s forces and\r\nthe withdrawal of the reiters had taken place, and then suddenly\r\nto seize Orleans, Soissons, Auxerre, and La Rochelle—the Huguenot\r\nstrongholds—for which duty Lansac, Martigues, Chavigny, and Brissac\r\nwere to be appointed, reinforce the garrison of Paris, and send the\r\nferocious Montluc into Gascony to subjugate the strongest Protestant\r\nprovinces, seize the sea-ports, and drive a Catholic wedge in between\r\nPoitou and the territories of the queen of Navarre, who already had\r\ntaken the precaution to strengthen her defenses. By some means, perhaps\r\nthrough the marshal Cossé, who was a Politique at heart, the cardinal\r\nChâtillon learned of the plot the very next day, and straightway\r\ninformed the marshal Montmorency, another moderate, of it. At the same\r\ntime the plan was discovered from another source to the prince of\r\nCondé. When Charles IX was taxed with information of it, he swore that\r\nthe whole thing was done without his knowledge, accused the cardinal\r\nof Lorraine of treasonable practice, and calling for pen and ink wrote\r\nto Condé promising “good and sincere” observation of all that had been\r\nagreed upon at Longjumeau.[1216]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed how completely this plan of the Guises for the\r\nsubjugation of Guyenne and Gascony is in alignment with the views\r\nof Montluc which he had expressed to Philip II.[1217] Hitherto\r\nthe King of Spain had been sustaining two separate lines of secret\r\ncorrespondence, one with Montluc direct; the other with the cardinal of\r\nLorraine through the duke of Alva. These two lines now are fused into a\r\nlarger whole, at least so far as the Spanish king is concerned.[1218]\r\nMontluc is the military, the cardinal of Lorraine the diplomatic, agent\r\nof Philip’s purposes.\r\n\r\nThe development of the Holy League has now advanced another stage\r\nin its evolution. The old warrior had not discontinued his secret\r\nrelations with Spain, in spite of his warm denial of the fact to the\r\nqueen mother, who taxed him with it,[1219] but through Bardaxi still\r\nkept in communication with Philip II. We find him writing twice to the\r\nKing in February 1567 and Philip responding in terms of encouragement\r\nin the following month.[1220] Guyenne was peculiarly vulnerable to such\r\nan attack as was now contemplated, and Montluc was certainly the best\r\ncaptain to execute it. The army of the Huguenots there was in a bad\r\nstate.[1221]\r\n\r\nThe instrument was already forged to Philip II’s hand in the local\r\nCatholic leagues in France. His interest in these was one of the\r\nsilent activities at Bayonne. The instructions to the duke of Alva and\r\nto Bardaxi were almost identical. “As the queen mother lacks either\r\nfixity of ideas or honesty of purpose”—the words are those of the\r\n_procès-verbal_ framed in the Spanish council-chamber, it is necessary\r\nto encourage the practices of Montluc and the Catholics.[1222] It must\r\nhave been a source of delight to the Spanish king to observe the rapid\r\nincrease of these associations. There are two changes to be noticed in\r\nthese provincial leagues: their increasingly popular character, and\r\ntheir tendency to fuse together. Hitherto they had been local in their\r\noperations. Now a process of federation is to be observed by which\r\nthe provincial leagues are gradually welded into one whole—in a word\r\nthe mighty Sainte Ligue of 1576 potentially exists now.[1223] The\r\nfederative tendency of these associations was a natural result of their\r\nincrease in number and membership. It was not a haphazard development\r\nat all. Design is evident throughout.[1224]\r\n\r\nThe renewal of civil war in 1567 had given a great impulse to this\r\nspirit of association.[1225] Nowhere was it more pronounced than in\r\nBurgundy. Tavannes, who was governor of Burgundy, in the year 1567\r\n(July 18), formed a league under the name of the Confrérie du St.\r\nEsprit. Churchmen, the nobility of Burgundy, and wealthy bourgeois who\r\nwished to preserve the Catholic religion were united together in the\r\nservice of the King. The version of its origin in the _Mémoires de\r\nTavannes_ is so interesting that I venture to quote it:\r\n\r\n Seeing so much discontent and so many threatening enterprises among\r\n the Huguenots, the queen, for safety’s sake, in the beginning of the\r\n year 1567 caused a levy of 9,000 Swiss [the actual number was 6,000]\r\n to be made under pretext that they were to be for the service of\r\n the duke of Alva in the Flemish War. The prevailing unrest and the\r\n rumors of insurrection gave the sieur de Tavannes, who penetrated the\r\n designs of the queen and the purpose of the Huguenots, the thought\r\n that a prudent man might also take precautions of his own. He reasoned\r\n that the Huguenots did not have more zeal for their cause than the\r\n Catholics for the old religion, and that those who would preserve\r\n it would give their lives and employ their last sou to succor the\r\n King; in a word, oppose league to league. He therefore organized\r\n the Confrérie du St. Esprit, which in reality was a league of the\r\n ecclesiastics and the nobility of Burgundy, with rich men from the\r\n towns, who voluntarily swore to serve in the interest of the Catholic\r\n religion against the Huguenots, sacrificing both person and property\r\n for the sake of the King. Without using coercion he gave orders for\r\n the enrolment of men-at-arms and the collection of money, created\r\n warders, spies, and messengers, in imitation of the Huguenots, in\r\n order to discover their machinations. The oath subscribed to justified\r\n this design. Each parish of Dijon paid its men for three months,\r\n and each town contributed 200 horse and 250 footmen. Burgundy could\r\n furnish 1,500 horse and 400 men on foot, paid for three months of the\r\n year. The sieur de Tavannes summoned an assembly in the Maison du Roi,\r\n ... and there caused the oath to be read.\r\n\r\nThe oath began:\r\n\r\n We swear by the most holy and incomprehensible name of God, the\r\n Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, in whose name we have been baptized, and\r\n we promise on our honor and the peril of our lives that, henceforth,\r\n at all times, through the chiefs and those who shall be named by the\r\n King under these articles, we will make known any enterprise that\r\n may work contrary to our said law and faith of which we have made\r\n profession in our baptism, and which we have maintained by the grace\r\n of God to the present, and also to make known every enterprise, which\r\n may clothe itself in hatred of the maintenance of the said faith,\r\n against the said royal Majesty, madame his mother, and messieurs his\r\n brothers, who rule over us by divine permission.\r\n\r\nAnd further on in the oath:\r\n\r\n We swear and promise in the present writing to render all friendship\r\n and fraternity the one to the other, to aid each other reciprocally\r\n against all phases of the opposite party, if they shall undertake any\r\n enterprise against any one of the signatories to the cause of this\r\n party; and for the sake of said aid we promise respectively, the one\r\n and the other, to employ all our persons, our credit, and our favors\r\n without sparing anything. And we promise to observe all the articles\r\n above sworn to without regard to friends, parents, or any relationship\r\n which we may have with those who undertake the contrary.[1226]\r\n\r\nIn the following year, on April 2, 1568, “La Fraternité des Catholiques\r\nde Châlons-sur-Saône” emerged.\r\n\r\n A l’imitation de la majesté du Roy nostre sire [so runs the\r\n instrument], et soubs sa protection et bon plaisir ... nous avons\r\n faict entre nous et pour tous autres Catholiques qui adjoindre se\r\n vouldront une fraternité qui s’appellera Confrairie et Société des\r\n Catholiques.\r\n\r\nAnd it is added—sign of omen—\r\n\r\n Et au cas qu’il advint que Dieu ne veuille que les persones de sa\r\n majesté et de messieurs ses frères ... fussent oppressés de sorte\r\n que ne sceussions avoir advertissement de leurs volontez, promettons\r\n rendre toute obeissance au général chef qui sera esleu.[1227]\r\n\r\nSix weeks later, on May 18, 1568, through the activity of Tavannes, a\r\nsimilar association was formed in Berry and was confirmed at Bourges by\r\nthe archbishop, Jacques le Roy.[1228] A month later La Ligue Chrétienne\r\net Royale, “for the defense of the Catholic church in France and for\r\nmaintaining the royal authority in the House of Valois,” to which\r\nwas appended the significant proviso, “so long as it shall govern in\r\nthe Catholic and Apostolic religion” appeared in Champagne under the\r\nauspices of Henry of Guise, then eighteen years of age and governor of\r\nthe province. The nobility, the bishop, and the clergy, in a meeting\r\nat Troyes, concluded, signed, and took an oath to this league on June\r\n25.[1229] Exactly a month later, on July 25, the Beauvaisis followed\r\nthe lead of Burgundy, Berry, and Champagne, and formed an “Association\r\nCatholique” for the same purpose.[1230] The movement also spread west\r\nof the Seine, into Maine and Anjou, where the clergy, the nobility,\r\nand the third estate, on July 11, 1568, established an association\r\nwhose members swore “de vivre et mourir en la religion catholique et de\r\nnous secourir les uns et les autres contre les rebelles et hérétiques\r\nsectaires de la nouvelle religion.” Forty persons signed the oath.[1231]\r\n\r\nIn Toulouse, the former league was revived in September, 1568, with\r\nnew energy under the patronage of the cardinal of Armagnac and actual\r\nleadership of a secular priest who preached war upon the Protestants\r\nwith a crusader’s zeal. On September 12 the latter gathered those\r\ndesirous of reviving the association in the cathedral of St. Etienne\r\nwhere a solemn oath was taken by all, who promised to devote life and\r\nproperty to the support of the catholic religion. The league thus\r\nformed was officially entitled La Croisade, with the motto: “Eamus\r\nnos, moriamur cum Christo.” All its members wore a white cross.[1232]\r\nEven some of the smaller towns followed the example of the provinces\r\nand large cities. At Anduze in Lower Languedoc at this same time the\r\nchurches formed a Catholic union.[1233] The movement actually spread\r\ninto Lower Navarre where in the same month, September, the sieur de\r\nLuxe and some others, at the instigation of the cardinal of Lorraine,\r\nperhaps, formed a league at St. Palais for the purpose of driving out\r\nthe Calvinist preachers in St. Palais. They seized La Rive, the pastor\r\nat St. Palais, Tarde, pastor at Ostabanès, both of whom were imprisoned\r\nin the house of De Luxe. But the prompt conduct of Jeanne d’Albret\r\nand the prince of Navarre, who won his spurs in the siege of Garris,\r\nspeedily crushed this association.[1234]\r\n\r\nIn view of this spontaneous organization of the Catholics everywhere,\r\nit was inevitable that the peace of Longjumeau would be of short\r\nduration, even if there had been no special circumstances to bring\r\nit to an end.[1235] The Guises, after the discovery of their secret\r\nconference of March 29, for the time being sought to dissemble their\r\nfeelings and purposes, and not to offend the King’s anger. When it was\r\nobserved in the royal presence that great inconvenience was likely to\r\narise in France for want of obedience to the edict, the cardinal of\r\nLorraine, hearing the remark, replied “Sur ma conscience, il n’y a rien\r\nplus necessaire.”\r\n\r\nThe feud between the Guises and Montmorencys seemed likely to involve\r\nthe state in war before very long.[1236] The quarrel between the two\r\nhouses was the more intense at this time owing to the fact that the\r\nduke of Anjou’s retention of the lieutenantship, in which office the\r\nGuises supported and maintained him for their own purposes, gave\r\noffense to the marshals, Montmorency, Damville, and Vieilleville; the\r\nmore so because they were all moderate Catholics and were dissatisfied\r\nwith the duke’s bigoted Catholic leanings and affiliation with the\r\nGuises; they argued that “it had not been seen heretofore, that the\r\nKing should have a lieutenant,” that the continuance of such a title,\r\nespecially in time of peace, was a prejudice to their station,[1237]\r\nadding significantly that they “being marshals knew what appertained\r\nto their charges.” The strife between the factions soon became so\r\nsevere as to dismay some, especially the cardinal of Bourbon, who\r\nthreatened “that in case the King would take no better order than he\r\nhad done, he would depart the court and give the world to understand\r\nhow he had at heart the honour of his house and the welfare of his\r\nfriends.” The chancellor L’Hôpital, having vainly endeavored to soften\r\nthe strife, asked leave to be discharged of his office—an event which\r\nthe cardinal of Lorraine would have hailed with delight. As it was, the\r\nGuises used Anjou to abuse the position of the chancellor.[1238]\r\n\r\nThe continued presence of the reiters and the Swiss also added to\r\nthe anxiety of those who were peaceably inclined, for “there was\r\nnot a town or a village in the Ile-de-France that was not furnished\r\nwith soldiers,” the country indeed teeming so much with them that\r\ntraveling now was more perilous even than during the wars.[1239] The\r\n6,000 Swiss still remained within four leagues of Paris at the last\r\nof May. The reiters of the prince stopped in Burgundy and plundered\r\nthe country; while the prince of Condé vainly demanded that they be\r\npaid at once.[1240] At Dijon five of them were slain by the desperate\r\npopulace and a massacre of thirteen of the inhabitants followed.[1241]\r\nMany thought that the war would be renewed the moment the harvest was\r\ngathered.[1242]\r\n\r\nLate in May the duke of Montmorency left Paris for Chantilly, while\r\nhis brother Damville stayed in the capital. The action of each was\r\nsignificant. At Chantilly the cardinal Châtillon and other Protestant\r\nnobles deliberated, while in Paris Damville’s house was frequented by\r\nthose hostile to the cardinal of Lorraine’s authority, notably the four\r\nmarshals, all of whom inveighed against him and were popularly believed\r\nto be forming a new opposition to him.[1243] The Huguenot leaders,\r\nCondé, Coligny, D’Andelot, all lay in various castles throughout the\r\nIle-de-France, with captains, soldiers, and gentlemen around them,\r\nand so distributed that no river separated them one from the other,\r\nwhile one ford between Paris and Rouen was kept open to enable those\r\nof the religion in Picardy to keep in touch with the prince.[1244] So\r\nskilfully was the distribution made that the leaders could have been\r\nable to unite within a day and a half if necessary.[1245]\r\n\r\nThe strain upon Charles IX soon began to tell. He was heard to say that\r\nhe would rather lose his crown outright than live in continual fear,\r\nand as the feud became intenser, the King yielded and finally showed\r\nhis hand by displacing the marshal Montmorency as governor of Paris,\r\nthough he dared not go quite so far as to put Henri d’Anjou in his\r\nroom, but chose his youngest brother, the duke of Alençon.[1246]\r\n\r\nWe discover at this time the germ of the Politique party.[1247]\r\nIf the Guises had been aware of the astonishing diplomatic stroke\r\nMontmorency had conceived in his retreat at Chantilly and which he\r\nhad communicated to the Huguenot leaders, they might not have pressed\r\nthe case of Anjou so insistently. This scheme was to separate the\r\nKing’s brother from his attachment to the Guises and at the same time\r\nenlist English aid in support of religious toleration in France—the\r\naim of the Politique party—by nothing less than bringing about the\r\nmarriage of the Valois prince with Queen Elizabeth. At the same time\r\nMontmorency, by gaining the favor of the duke, would work the cardinal\r\nout of power. To this end the duke approached the English envoy in\r\nFrance.[1248]\r\n\r\nDay by day the animosity of the parties grew. In a certain sense the\r\nperil of the times was greater than during a state of war. Daily\r\nmurder by dagger and by drowning, and violation of property took place\r\nthroughout France, to such an extent that it was said more had been\r\nmurdered since the publication of the peace than were in the war which\r\nit was supposed to have concluded.[1249] But although the animosity\r\nof the parties was strong enough to incite them to war, the renewal\r\nof hostilities was yet very dependent upon the fluctuation of events\r\nin the Netherlands,[1250] and at this moment the balance there was\r\ninclined in Spain’s favor.[1251]\r\n\r\nWilliam of Orange, while not in alliance with the French, nevertheless\r\nsought to avail himself of the services of the 4,000 reiters which\r\nJohn Casimir had raised for the French Protestants, whose use was no\r\nlonger required by the Huguenots after the peace of Longjumeau. A\r\nhorror of Spanish cruelty was beginning to pervade Germany and brought\r\nhim sympathy and support.[1252] Calvinist Europe built high hopes\r\nupon this assistance for the Dutch.[1253] But Orange was straitened\r\nfor money[1254] and it was not until the middle of August that he was\r\nready to return to give Alva battle with an army of 6,000 horsemen and\r\nfour regiments of foot, besides the Lorrainers and Gascons who were\r\nall gunners. According to the plan of the prince, three armies were to\r\nenter the Netherlands at once, the French under a Huguenot leader named\r\nCocqueville, through Artois; the Count of Hoogstraeten between the\r\nRhine and the Meuse, and Louis of Nassau through Groningen.\r\n\r\nBut the whole plan failed. Cocqueville raised seven or eight hundred\r\nmen with the intention of provoking Artois to revolt.[1255] Failing\r\nto take Doulens by surprise, Cocqueville pillaged the abbey-town of\r\nDammartin. The duke of Alva energetically protested to Charles IX\r\nagainst this violation of the Spanish provinces by French subjects,\r\nand the marshal Cossé was sent into Picardy. The foreigners in\r\nCocqueville’s band were summarily beheaded at St. Valéry, the leader\r\nhimself was sent to Abbeville for trial for treason and executed,\r\nand the whole expedition came to naught.[1256] The enforced delay of\r\nthe prince of Orange, united with this repulse, was fatal to the\r\nNetherland project. On July 21, 1568, Louis of Nassau was defeated at\r\nJemmingen by Alva, Spanish tyranny was fixed more firmly in the Low\r\nCountries, and Egmont and Hoorne were shortly afterward sent to the\r\nscaffold.[1257]\r\n\r\nEverything was now out of joint. The success of the Dutch would have\r\nemboldened their French coreligionists to renew the struggle with some\r\nhope of success.[1258] But the Catholic victory in the Low Countries\r\nhardened the resolution of the French government. Hitherto chiefly\r\nthe lesser nobility of France had been successfully coerced by the\r\nFrench crown. Now the cardinal of Lorraine intended to do the like with\r\nthe higher nobles, compelling them either to abandon their religious\r\nand political contentions or to take up arms.[1259] At the same time\r\nmilitary preparations began to be made which could not but be viewed\r\nwith alarm by the Huguenots. The crown was stronger in cavalry, in\r\ninfantry, in artillery, and in munitions. The country as a whole was\r\nwith the King, and the chief cities were in his hands. “The great\r\ncities,” said Coligny mournfully, “are the tombs of our armies.”[1260]\r\n\r\nSo carefully were the preparations made that the King remained armed\r\nwhile the Huguenots were scattered and unarmed,[1261] saving large\r\nnumbers of individual nobles who yet stood upon their guard. In\r\nnorthern and central France, La Rochelle excepted, the government\r\ncontrolled all the towns. In Provence and Languedoc, however, many\r\nof the towns were governed by the Protestants.[1262] In order to\r\nprevent the communication of intelligence between the various parts\r\nof France under Protestant control, Charles IX even had refused to\r\npermit Condé to levy money upon the Huguenots for payment of the\r\nreiters, notwithstanding the governments’ own poverty, although the\r\nprince cunningly suggested such an action.[1263] The outlook was dark\r\nindeed. The Huguenots nowhere save in the south seemed strong enough\r\nto take the field, and it seemed hopeless for them to expect to join\r\nwith their coreligionists of the north owing to the vigilance of\r\nMontluc in Languedoc and Tavannes in Burgundy and to the fact that the\r\nwhole course of the Loire was patrolled by forces of the government.\r\nMoreover, the general contribution being stopped, both resources and\r\ncommunication were at an end; the gentry too were impoverished by the\r\nlate war to a very great extent, having “consumed as much in eight\r\nmonths as they had gathered in four years before,”[1264] so that the\r\nwisest of the Huguenot leaders were of the opinion that the religion\r\nwas not in a state to attempt anything by open arms.\r\n\r\nWhile he tried to augment his forces Condé sought to remedy matters\r\nby appeal to the King,[1265] complaining of the outrages inflicted\r\non the Huguenots[1266] (Montluc had even hanged seven gentlemen of\r\nthe entourage of the queen of Navarre, in Languedoc), being careful\r\nnot to impute these wrongs, however, to the King, but reprobating the\r\nmalignancy of the cardinal of Lorraine and accusing him of secret\r\nintelligence with Spain.[1267] The cardinal, thus assailed, parried\r\nthrough the King, who two days later issued a proclamation, which after\r\nreciting the complaints of murder, robberies and other wrongs alleged\r\nby those of “the pretended Reformed religion,” declared that the King,\r\nhaving sent his _maîtres des requêtes_ into the provinces where these\r\nacts of violence had been perpetrated, was satisfied of the substantial\r\njustice of the administration, and asserted that the complaints had\r\neither been manufactured by the Huguenot leaders, or else grossly\r\nexaggerated. The proclamation closed by commanding all judges and other\r\nofficers, on pain of deprivation, to search out and punish wrong-doers,\r\nso that those of the religion might not have ground for complaining\r\nthat justice was not done them.[1268]\r\n\r\nSuch a proclamation was mere verbiage, however, and was intended to\r\nlull the anxiety of the Huguenots while the government’s preparations\r\nwent forward. It deceived none of the Protestant leaders. The signs of\r\nthe times were too plain to be concealed. Arms were secretly levied and\r\nstored in La Rochelle, Saintes, Châtellerault, St. Jean-d’Angély.[1269]\r\nTo these signs was now added another unmistakable indication. In\r\nAugust, 1568 the concentration of fourteen companies of gendarmes and\r\nseveral bands of infantry in Burgundy, where the two most conspicuous\r\nof the leaders of the Huguenots then were—the prince of Condé and\r\nColigny[1270]—ostensibly to prevent the prince from delivering his\r\nGerman reiters to the prince of Orange, precipitated civil war anew.\r\n\r\nProtestant historians have contended that the government of Charles IX\r\nwas wholly to blame for the renewal of war. But it may be fairly said\r\nthat Charles IX acted not only according to his right, but according\r\nto policy in seeking to prevent the union of the Huguenot and Dutch\r\ninterests. France was not yet prepared to espouse an open anti-Spanish\r\npolicy, though she was already secretly so inclining,[1271] and\r\nthe projected alliance of the prince of Condé and the prince of\r\nOrange[1272] would have been certain seriously to compromise her\r\nwith Spain. Finally, it may be added, that there was not a little of\r\nself-ambition in Condé’s action.[1273]\r\n\r\nThis attempted co-operation of the prince of Condé and the prince of\r\nOrange drew the French government into close association with the duke\r\nof Alva. But the diplomatic relations now established between the\r\ncourts of Paris and Madrid were of much greater importance and the\r\nnegotiations were energetically forwarded by the cardinal of Lorraine,\r\nwho on November 21, sent the cardinal of Guise into Spain charged to\r\ntreat of marriage between Philip II and Marguerite of Valois,[1274] or\r\nif that proved unacceptable, to suggest Philip’s marriage with one of\r\nthe daughters of the Emperor, while Charles IX was to marry the other.\r\nAt the same time Alva proposed that the duke of Anjou—the future\r\nHenry III—should marry the queen of Portugal.[1275] The far-reaching\r\neffect of such a series of alliances is manifest. The two houses of\r\nHapsburg would become dynastically united again in a common family and\r\npolitico-religious purpose, into which association France would be\r\nwoven.\r\n\r\nThe government had secretly prepared for the sudden investment of\r\nLa Rochelle, intending to “spring” the war suddenly at that point,\r\nbut had been compelled to alter the plan. This change of plan induced\r\nthe resolution to attempt to capture the prince and Coligny,[1276]\r\nthe purpose of the Guises (with whom the King and his mother were not\r\nacting) probably being to send them to the scaffold, as Alva had done\r\nwith Egmont and Hoorne.\r\n\r\nBut the deception and duplicity which they used to allay the suspicions\r\nof the prince and the admiral offended the bluff, soldierly honor of\r\nTavannes, who, though a bigoted Catholic, would not stoop to such a\r\ndishonorable course of action.[1277] While feigning to obey the orders\r\nto capture the two leaders, he contrived to apprise them of their\r\ndanger by managing so as to have his letters intercepted by them.[1278]\r\nThanks to this timely warning, escape was made possible. On August 23,\r\n1568 Condé and Coligny, accompanied by the members of their families\r\nand D’Andelot’s—the princess of Condé being pregnant—crossed the\r\nLoire in sudden flight, guarded on the road by a hundred horsemen. The\r\nfugitives were bound for La Rochelle, which was safely reached without\r\nmishap, though not without peril.\r\n\r\nFrom the safe retreat of this famous port and stronghold the prince of\r\nCondé issued a manifesto protesting that he and his followers intended\r\nnothing prejudicial to the King, but only to protect those of the\r\nreligion from the tyranny and oppression of their enemies. A form of\r\noath was adopted, to be taken by the nobility, officers, and others\r\nof the prince’s army, regulations were issued for the maintenance\r\nof discipline in the army, for the prevention of desertion, private\r\nplundering, and avoidance of excess of baggage, camp-followers,\r\ndisorders, and quarrels.[1279]\r\n\r\nThe government at once took up the gage of battle and prepared to\r\npush the war. On September 25, 1568, an edict proscribed the Reformed\r\nfaith, exiled the pastors thereof, and excluded Protestants from\r\npublic offices and from the universities.[1280] As far back as July\r\nthe government had begun negotiations with the Pope to secure license\r\nto alienate from the lands of the church 200,000 crowns per annum.\r\nThis had failed when first petitioned,[1281] but the cardinal of\r\nLorraine by the end of August had managed to raise 1,200,000 francs,\r\nalthough half of it had to go to pay old debts to the Parisians.[1282]\r\nThe holy father, having at last been persuaded of the good of the\r\ncause, consented to the alienation of 100,000 crowns annual rent\r\nof the clerical lands, upon condition that the money be strictly\r\nemployed for the compulsion of those who denied the authority of Rome\r\nand the revocation of the Edict of Toleration.[1283] The debate upon\r\nthe measure pertaining to the church lands brought about a clash in\r\nthe King’s Privy Council between the cardinal of Lorraine and the\r\nchancellor L’Hôpital, on September 19. The latter protested against\r\nthe withdrawal of the Edict of Toleration, on the ground that it would\r\ninduce the war at once and lead to the overrunning of the country\r\nagain by the reiters, and refused to affix the royal seal to the\r\nproposed ordinance, without which the papal writing was of no force in\r\nFrance. The cardinal retaliated by taunting the chancellor with being\r\na hypocrite and asserted that his wife and daughter were Calvinists.\r\nL’Hôpital retorted by sarcastically alluding to the notorious\r\nadministrative practices of the Guises, at which the cardinal became\r\nso angry that he would have seized the venerable chancellor by his\r\ngreat white beard if the marshal Montmorency had not stepped between\r\nthem. In his rage the cardinal, turning to the queen mother, declared\r\nthe chancellor’s vicious policy of toleration was at the bottom of\r\nthe evils of France and that if he were in the hands of the Parlement\r\nof Paris his head would not tarry on his shoulders twenty-four hours\r\nlonger.[1284] The issue of this episode was not long in forthcoming.\r\nOn September 28 Michel de l’Hôpital was dismissed from office[1285]\r\nand the seal given to the archbishop of Sens, Biragues, a pupil of the\r\nGuises and a henchman of Philip of Spain.[1286] It was he who rescinded\r\nthe Edict of January and the other two edicts of pacification and\r\nexiled all Huguenot preachers from France within twenty days, forbade\r\nall exercise of the Reformed religion on pain of death, and dismissed\r\nfrom office and the universities all those who were Protestants.\r\n\r\nThe new civil war was represented as a war of religion; indeed as\r\na crusade, the King going to evensong at La Sainte-Chapelle, on\r\nMichaelmas Eve, where the heart of St. Louis was interred, and on the\r\nmorrow marching in procession with the relics of St. Denis, as did the\r\nformer kings of France before they took the road of the cross. The\r\nduke of Anjou, the King’s brother, was appointed lieutenant-general\r\nof the realm on September 1, and proclamation made to the companies\r\nof gendarmerie and the bands of archers, to assemble at Orleans, now\r\nbecome the Catholic headquarters.[1287]\r\n\r\nCharles IX, in October, went in person to Orleans, in order by his\r\npresence, to enlarge the enlistments, and also to overcome the\r\nsuspicion that the whole movement was made at the instigation of\r\nthe Guises. The government of Paris was left to the King’s youngest\r\nbrother, the duke of Alençon, assisted by the duke of Montmorency. In\r\nthe meantime the prince of Condé had remained in the vicinity of La\r\nRochelle during September, while his army was gathering.[1288] When the\r\narmy was massed, he moved up the Loire with his forces.\r\n\r\nThe emulation that had characterized the Huguenot nobility in the last\r\nwar now served Condé well. The provinces were alive with activity\r\nduring this autumn. The young prince of Navarre, the future Henry\r\nIV, was to win eminence in the coming struggle, and at this time\r\nwas at Bergerac where forces were assembled to assist Condé.[1289]\r\nThe Catholic and governmental forces were no less alert. The King’s\r\ncaptains were employed in all parts of the realm to levy men. Montluc,\r\ndiscovering a plot in Bordeaux to deliver the town to those of the\r\nReformed religion, executed the greater part of those so accused. At\r\nToulouse, Auxerre, and Lyons all men were constrained to go to mass. In\r\nProvence and Languedoc the peasantry even rose against the Protestants.\r\nTo crown all both sides levied reiters in Germany.[1290]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUTUMN CAMPAIGN OF 1568\r\n\r\n  _Methuen & Co._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe lower course of the Loire was the fighting-line, for command of\r\nwhich both sides aimed.[1291] The tactics of Anjou were to avoid\r\nan engagement, if possible, and to prevent Condé’s forces from\r\ncrossing, which he succeeded in doing through a stratagem.[1292] The\r\npassage of the Loire being stopped, and the river towns being all\r\ngarrisoned, especially Saumur, the prince of Condé, after taking the\r\ncastle of Champigny which belonged to the duke de Montpensier, fell\r\nback on Loudun. The country was so wet that neither horse nor foot\r\ncould do much. The prince excelled in cavalry, the Catholic army in\r\ninfantry.[1293] In the provinces the Catholic preponderance was marked.\r\nThe duke of Aumale in Champagne had 18 companies of men-at-arms and 25\r\nensigns of footmen, awaiting the coming of the reiters; Marshal Cossé\r\nwas in Picardy with 15 companies of men-at-arms and 2,000 footmen. The\r\nreason for the presence of so many troops so far from the actual seat\r\nof the war is to be found in the fact that the movements of the prince\r\nof Orange, who had entered France in December,[1294] gave great anxiety\r\nto the government. The prince was now on the borders of Picardy, but\r\nhis horsemen rode as far as Compiègne and Rheims, to the amazement\r\nof the court and the consternation of the Guises, who dispatched the\r\ncardinal of Guise to Madrid for the help of Philip II.[1295] If the two\r\nprinces could have effected a junction in the meantime, Paris would\r\nhave been between hammer and anvil. As it was, the danger was so great\r\nthat the King hastily began to raise an additional army in December,\r\ncalling out ban and arrière-ban, and in order that the capital might\r\nbe able to withstand a siege, if worst came to worst, drew all the\r\nprovisions of the country roundabout Paris for a space of ten miles\r\ninto the city.\r\n\r\nThe position of the various armies was an interesting one. In east\r\nFrance the reiters of the duke of Deuxponts were endeavoring to join\r\nOrange who delayed his movement to await their coming,[1296] while\r\nAlva dogged his steps.[1297] In the west Condé was vainly striving to\r\ncross the Loire in order to join Orange and the Protestant reiters,\r\nwhile the duke of Anjou was straining every nerve to keep him back.\r\nIn the midst of all, Paris lay calm but tense[1298]—the undisturbed\r\ncenter of the cyclone of war. Both armies suffered from the terrible\r\nweather of December. The soldiers of each side were dying of famine and\r\nprivation.[1299]\r\n\r\nThe hope long deferred that Condé had cherished of Orange joining him\r\nmade him heartsick at last; the latter could not come, for Alva, the\r\nduke of Aumale, and the Catholic reiters under a German colonel named\r\nSchomberg—a name destined to become illustrious—were too closely\r\nwatching his movements.[1300] Even had these impediments been removed,\r\nthe Seine and the Loire would have had to be crossed—an impossible\r\nfeat.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1568-69 was occupied with Huguenot and Catholic\r\nnegotiations for foreign support and with preparations for a renewal\r\nof the war when the spring came. Meanwhile the delay of France to pay\r\nits debts in Switzerland had gradually provoked a change of public\r\nsentiment in the forest cantons, which pushed them a few years later\r\ninto espousal of Spain. The loss of its ascendency in Switzerland was\r\na particularly hard blow to France. For the policy of Spain had been\r\nto rouse a religious war in the Alpine lands, so that her intervention\r\nwould find easy entrance. The five cantons of the center were the\r\nfulcrum of Spain’s diplomatic efforts. Day by day the tension became\r\ngreater, the five cantons inclining more to Spain, their neighbors\r\nleaning to France, while between the two groups Bern and Zurich\r\ncontinued neutral, refusing to aid the prince of Condé with either men\r\nor money.[1301]\r\n\r\nMilitary events were insignificant. Anjou remained with his army in\r\nLimousin, and the prince of Condé in Périgord. On December 23, 1568,\r\nthere was a skirmish near Loudun. In January Condé marched to the\r\nrelief of Sancerre. The town was of very strong situation and Brocbart,\r\nthe Huguenot commandant, filled a great number of wine-vats with sand\r\nand earth and used them for gabions, and so managed to hold out against\r\nfive assaults,[1302] although the place was so invested by the Catholic\r\narmy that the prince could do nothing to relieve it. Failing this,\r\nhe marched upon Saumur in the vain hope of forcing a crossing of the\r\nLoire at some point, on the way putting the garrison of 150 men in the\r\nabbey of St. Florens at Pont-de-Cé to the sword. Both armies suffered\r\nterribly from the weather and the condition of the country.[1303]\r\n\r\nIn the King’s council the Politique party still labored for peace, and\r\nin the interim made an unsuccessful effort to restore the Edict of\r\nToleration.[1304] The cessation of hostilities, however, was complete\r\nenough to alarm the Pope, who feared another truce would be made and\r\nused exhortation and promise in order to prevent any compromise with\r\nheresy.[1305]\r\n\r\nThe Dutch and English were attentive observers of the movement in\r\nFrance, the former especially, for they felt that they and the French\r\nProtestants were engaged in a common cause. From England came numbers\r\nof English gentlemen to La Rochelle, in order to follow Condé in the\r\nwar, and the Channel and the Bay of Biscay were thronged with English\r\nand Dutch privateers.[1306] Elizabeth, as the saying went, wanted “to\r\nthrow the stone and hide the arm.” Although the English ambassador,\r\nSir Henry Norris, protested the innocence of his government and the\r\nqueen wrote with her own hand that she would not interfere in France,\r\nEnglishmen were landed at La Rochelle and in Brittany and English\r\nvessels brought over gunpowder, shoes, and arms.[1307]\r\n\r\nWhile Anjou held the line of the Loire, the French government\r\nestablished its military base at Château-Thierry on the Marne\r\nin order to prevent communication between the Protestant German\r\nprinces, especially the elector palatine and the duke of Deuxponts;\r\nor between the Dutch and its own revolted subjects. To this end it\r\nwas planned that the duke of Aumale, with a force of reiters sent by\r\nthe margrave of Baden and the count of Westelburg, and some troops\r\nproferred by Count Mansfeldt[1308] should be sent against the prince\r\nof Orange, while the duke of Anjou was to go against the prince of\r\nCondé.[1309] But William of Orange effected a junction with the duke\r\nof Deuxponts[1310] in spite of D’Aumale’s effort to prevent him.[1311]\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Lutheran princes had now become more definite in\r\nfavor of the Huguenots.[1312]\r\n\r\nThe international Protestant plan was to drive its blows in on either\r\nside of Lorraine and thus sever the chain through central Europe by\r\nwhich Philip II held his dominions together, and to separate the two\r\nhouses of Hapsburg.[1313] The conduct of the Emperor furthered this\r\nproject, for when Charles IX sent La Forrest to the Emperor to protest\r\nagainst the action of the Lutheran princes of Germany and to continue\r\nthe talk of his marriage with the Emperor’s daughter, Ferdinand,\r\nwhile expressing his regret at the troubled state of France, received\r\nthe marriage proposition coldly and complained of the damage done\r\nby the French army under the duke of Aumale within the limits of the\r\nempire,[1314] and recommended that Charles try peaceful methods instead\r\nof force for the pacification of his kingdom.[1315] Parallel with\r\nthe project to co-operate with the prince of Orange and the duke of\r\nDeuxponts, Coligny planned a revival of Huguenot activity in the south\r\nof France so that this diversion would weaken resistance to the other.\r\nThe aim was, with the aid of the “viscounts” to break a way across the\r\nupper Loire, and so open the road to German assistance.[1316]\r\n\r\nThe combined array against D’Aumale was too great for him to make\r\nhead.[1317] Nor was the adverse double military situation the sole\r\nanxiety of the French government. Montmorency and the duke of Bouillon\r\nwere so disaffected that there was even expectation of their openly\r\njoining the Huguenots. The cost of the two armies amounted to 900,000\r\nlivres a month, besides the gendarmerie and artillery, which was about\r\ntwo million each quarter.[1318] There was owing to the gendarmerie\r\n12,000,000 of livres for six quarters; to the 6,000 Swiss with the\r\nduke of Anjou 300,000 livres; to those with the duke of Aumale 100,000\r\nlivres besides what was owing to the French infantry. Both of the\r\nKing’s commanders were so short of funds that they were forced to seize\r\nchurch-plate and even reliquaries.[1319]\r\n\r\nIn these extremities Charles IX viewed the renewal of war on the\r\nopening of spring with alarm and began to think of making peace for a\r\nterm, with no intention of keeping it, but merely in order to avoid\r\na catastrophe and with the hope that some of the Huguenots might be\r\ndisarmed in the interim. But suddenly the cloud was lifted. The\r\nroyal army under the nominal command of the duke of Anjou, but really\r\ncommanded by the veteran Tavannes, who had orders to give battle at\r\nall cost before the duke of Deuxponts could arrive, won the decisive\r\nvictory of Jarnac on March 13, 1569. It was a fierce and bloody battle.\r\n\r\nThe prince of Condé, after having been dangerously wounded and taken\r\nprisoner, suffered a foul death at the hands of some unknown assassin\r\nin the royal army, who shot him with a pistol-ball.[1320] In the\r\nengagement the Scotchman, Stuart, who had killed the constable at St.\r\nDenis, was taken and brought to the duke, who said to him: “So here\r\nyou are, you traitor, you who have frequently boasted that you wished\r\nto kill the queen, my mother. Now you shall receive your deserts.” At\r\nthat moment the marquis de Villars, the old constable’s brother-in-law,\r\nappeared, and with his own hands executed vengeance.[1321]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Croquis_\r\n\r\nDU\r\n\r\nTHÉATRE DE LA GUERRE\r\n\r\npour la\r\n\r\n_Période du 24 Février au 13 Mars 1569._\r\n\r\n Reproduced by permission of the author from M.

All the\r\nstores and shops were closed as though it were a holiday. The clergy,\r\nbearing the relics of the saints, marched first to the convent of the\r\nCordeliers, and then to that of the Jacobins, where a fiery sermon was\r\npreached by a Jacobin of Auxerre named Mammerot. After the sermon the\r\n_Te Deum_ was celebrated, and then the militia of the city assembled\r\nunder the command of the four captains, and a grand review was held in\r\nthe streets. The celebration ended by a great bonfire in front of the\r\nHotel-de-Ville, and the firing of cannon.[1322]\r\n\r\nThe Pope took the victory of Jarnac as a direct answer to prayer.[1323]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD CIVIL WAR (_Continued_). THE PEACE OF ST. GERMAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the death of Condé the Admiral Coligny became the actual leader of\r\nthe Protestant cause in France,[1324] the more so when his brother\r\nd’Andelot died on May 7,[1325] although the young prince of Condé and\r\nhis cousin, Henry of Navarre, were theoretically so regarded.[1326]\r\nIn the nature of things, the leadership of two boys—the former was\r\nseventeen, the other sixteen years of age—could only be a nominal one.\r\n\r\nAfter the first shock of dismay at the prince’s death had passed,\r\nthe Huguenots were not dispirited. It is true that numbers of the\r\nProtestant gentry returned home.[1327] But the Huguenot position\r\nwas strong in upper and lower Poitou, for the line of the Charente\r\nfrom Angoulême to Saintes was theirs, besides St. Jean-d’Angély, La\r\nRochelle, and the islands of Marins and Oléron.[1328] The admiral\r\nrallied his forces at Tonnay-Charente,[1329] which he could do with\r\nimpunity since the duke of Anjou raised the siege of Angoulême on April\r\n12.[1330]\r\n\r\nThe hope of the court was to prolong the war, since the King controlled\r\nmost of the towns and the river passages, “while the religion, their\r\nconquered country excepted, had but the fields,”[1331] until the\r\nresources of the Huguenots would at last become exhausted—money,\r\nmen, munitions. But the queen of England loaned 20,000 livres to the\r\nProtestants, the jewels of Condé and Jeanne d’Albret being taken\r\nas security.[1332] Jeanne d’Albret in person directed the foreign\r\nnegotiations of the Huguenots.[1333] The anxiety of the Huguenots\r\nwas greatest over the effect which Condé’s death might have upon the\r\nforeign assistance which they were looking for, and letters from\r\nthe prince of Navarre and the other leaders of the Huguenot army in\r\nSaintonge earnestly urged the reiters’ advance to the Loire.[1334]\r\nColigny’s hope was by making a detour by way of Cognac and Chalais to\r\nreach the Loire and effect a junction with Deuxponts. To his great\r\nrelief, the prince of Orange and the duke of Deuxponts wrote assuring\r\nthe admiral of their continued adherence.[1335] As good as his word,\r\nDeuxponts, who was at Pont-à-Mousson on January 11, 1569, entered\r\nFrance near Langres, having passed by Joinville, the seat of the Guises\r\nin Lorraine, where the old duchess of Guise was then staying,[1336] and\r\nadvanced upon Dijon where he arrived on April 26.[1337]\r\n\r\nThe real center of the government’s activity was Metz, which became the\r\nbasis of operations against Deuxponts and Orange.[1338] Active efforts\r\nwere made to repair the duke of Anjou’s losses and to strengthen his\r\nposition.[1339] The offer of Spanish support which Alva had made was\r\nnow formally accepted, for after the mission of Castelnau to the\r\nmargrave of Baden to get relief, he was sent into Flanders to solicit\r\nthe assistance of Alva, since it now had become the common interest\r\nof both crowns to crush the Protestants.[1340] The French commanders,\r\nthe dukes of Nemours and Aumale, had received orders to prevent the\r\napproach of Deuxponts at all cost,[1341] but Aumale, partially on\r\naccount of carelessness, partly because of misinformation, failed in\r\nhis task, and by clever management Deuxponts at last succeeded in\r\ncrossing the Saône above Bar into Auxerre and Berry, scaled the walls\r\nof Nevers, thereby shortening the road between him and the Huguenot\r\narmy, and finally captured La Charité upon the Loire on May 20, after\r\nten days of siege, and thus controlled the link which united Huguenots\r\nand reiters.[1342]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAMPAIGN OF THE SUMMER & AUTUMN OF 1569\r\n\r\n  _Methuen & Co._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIf the Huguenots had been dispirited after Jarnac, they had reason\r\nto feel elated after the capture of La Charité. Although the duke of\r\nAnjou kept the field in Saintonge, Angoumois, and Limousin, the army\r\nwas so mutinous for want of pay, so depleted by desertion and disease,\r\nthat it was far from formidable.[1343] Paris was in consternation\r\nafter the capture of La Charité and anticipated seeing the high hats\r\nand great feathers of the reiters before long.[1344] The _échevins_ of\r\nthe city were ordered with all speed to make sale of the property of\r\nthe Protestants to provide means for a new army, which had to be made\r\nup of peasant levies, “all their soldiers and men of the greatest\r\nvalue being already abroad.”[1345] The queen mother, having received\r\nletters complaining of lack of funds and mutiny in his army, bitterly\r\nreproached Aumale for negligence and cowardice in letting the duke\r\nof Deuxponts capture La Charité, and hastily started for the army in\r\nSaintonge, in company with the cardinals of Lorraine and Bourbon, where\r\nshe went right among the soldiers with words of encouragement.[1346]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF LA ROCHE-L’ABEILLE, JUNE 25, 1569\r\n\r\n(Tortorel and Perissin)]\r\n\r\nBut mutiny of the army, and the capture of La Charité, with the\r\nprospective union of Coligny and the duke of Deuxponts, was not all\r\nthat worried the queen and the cardinal. Casimir of the County Palatine\r\nwas reported to be coming with 6,000 horse and as many foot; moreover,\r\nthe Emperor was hostile.[1347] The extremity of the government was so\r\ngreat that compromise was necessary, and Catherine had in mind to patch\r\nmatters up by offering her daughter Marguerite of France in marriage\r\nto the young Henry of Navarre—a plan whose consummation three years\r\nlater precipitated the massacre of St. Bartholomew.[1348] Marshal\r\nDamville, the second son of the old constable, whose Politique leanings\r\nalready had made him conspicuous, was significantly appointed the\r\nKing’s lieutenant in Languedoc. Toleration was in the air once more.\r\n\r\nBut all of a sudden the Catholic cause revived for an instant.[1349]\r\nColigny fell ill, and the progress of the Huguenot army was thereby\r\nimpeded. Worse still, the duke of Deuxponts was stricken with a burning\r\nfever, so that he died the very day of his arrival in La Marche.[1350]\r\nStrozzi with some Italian forces attacked Coligny at La Roche-L’Abeille\r\non June 25, when the rain was pouring in such torrents that the\r\nmatchlocks of the Italians were useless, so that the soldiers on both\r\nsides clubbed their weapons—in the expressive words of D’Aubigné,\r\n“rompre croce sur cap”—that is, broke the crosses of their arquebuses\r\nover the heads of their antagonists.[1351] In the conflict Strozzi was\r\ntaken prisoner. From this time forth the army of the King was simply\r\na disorderly mass of men. Famine and fever so reduced it that the\r\nduke of Anjou was not able to defend himself, let alone invading the\r\nenemy’s territory. To increase his forces, he put arms in the hands of\r\nthe peasantry of Limousin, with the result that a local _jacquerie_\r\nprevailed in the province. Lansac was repulsed in assaulting La\r\nCharité; Châtellerault (July 12) and Lusignan (July 20) were taken by\r\nthe Huguenots.[1352] The Catholics failed before Niort, to whose relief\r\nthe brilliant La Noue came after his own seizure of Luçon.[1353]\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the government was compelled to content\r\nitself with maintaining the line of the Loire save at La Charité, while\r\nit sought foreign succor.[1354] But the Swiss could not be expected\r\nuntil the middle of September, and Coligny sought to profit by the\r\nsituation to take Saumur and thus secure a crossing on the lower\r\nLoire also, and Poitiers, for which purpose he divided the Protestant\r\narmy,[1355] to the intense alarm of the government, which tried,\r\nthrough the queen mother, to delay action by drawing the admiral into\r\nan empty parley. This is the moment when the marriage of Henry of\r\nNavarre with Marguerite of France was first broached. But the admiral\r\nand Jeanne d’Albret were not to be deceived, and the siege of Poitiers\r\nwas resolutely continued. (It lasted from July 25 to September 7,\r\n1569.) The Catholic party fully appreciated that the importance of the\r\nwar depended upon the success or failure of the Huguenots before this\r\ncity, into which the young duke of Guise, then but nineteen years of\r\nage, had thrown himself on July 12 with all the ardor of his father\r\nbefore Metz. If Coligny took the town, some notable prisoners of war\r\nwould have fallen into his hands, the dukes of Guise and Mayenne and\r\nthe abbess of La Trinité, a sister of the cardinal of Bourbon[1356]\r\nand the ill-starred prince of Condé, the ransom of whom would have\r\nabundantly provided for the reiters in the service of the Protestants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIEGE OF POITIERS, 1569\r\n\r\n(Tortorel and Perissin)]\r\n\r\nPoitiers was one of the most mediaeval towns in France. The remains of\r\nits towers and fortifications, its narrow bridges, the ruined palace\r\nof the ancient dukes of Aquitaine, everything recalled the life of a\r\nvanished past.[1357] The admiral’s guns soon made two breaches in the\r\nwall, but the fire from the castle and platform drove his men back and\r\nthe breaches were repaired. The town, however, was too large in circuit\r\nfor Guise to defend the whole,[1358] since many vineyards and fields\r\nwere within its walls, in consequence of which the French had made a\r\nline of double trenches within the town. On August 19 the Huguenots\r\nmade a furious assault, broke through the wall, and drove the Guisard\r\nforces back of the inside trenches. The enemy was “so straitly pent”\r\nthat for sixteen days the soldiers had to live upon horse-flesh. The\r\nmost remarkable incident of the siege was the driving-out of a great\r\nnumber of people, old men and women and children, who were unable to\r\nfight and could not be fed on account of the lack of provisions. So\r\nreluctant were they to go that they had to be whipped through the\r\ngates. Fortunately the duke of Guise took pity upon them at last,\r\nalthough in the city bread was so scarce that the food of one had to\r\nsuffice for ten. All the horses and asses in the town were slain,\r\nthe gentry out of honor to their position sating their hunger on the\r\nformer. Of wheat, barley, and other grain there was none, nor was\r\nthere a green thing left growing in the city. Even rats and mice were\r\nconsumed.[1359]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POITIERS IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY]\r\n\r\nThe strength of Coligny (he had about 10,000 footmen and 8,000 to 9,000\r\nhorse) made it impossible for Anjou to dislodge him by direct attack.\r\nHis own strength, as appeared by a general muster on September 3,\r\nconsisted of 1,500 French gendarmes, 700 Italian horse, 1,000 Walloons,\r\nand 4,000 reiters, besides La Vallette’s regiment of 400 horse—it was\r\nmuch reduced during the siege—and the duke of Longueville’s and some\r\nother companies. Of footmen he had 6,000 French, 4,000 Swiss, 2,500\r\nItalians, and 2,000 Walloons. Although this army in actual numbers\r\nexcelled that of Coligny, in reality it was considerably inferior.\r\nThe troops were many of them without officers, the 6,000 French were\r\ndrafted peasantry unused to the use of arms; all of them were suffering\r\nfrom hunger and many from fever. The duke of Anjou, therefore, with\r\nthe approval of his mother, determined to try to draw off Coligny from\r\nbefore Poitiers by a feigned attack upon Châtellerault.[1360] For this\r\npurpose he crossed the river Creuse on September 4 and planted his\r\nartillery before the town. The honor of the first assault was given\r\nto the Italians, which offended the French, who refused to support\r\nthem.[1361] Nevertheless a breach 40 feet wide was made in the wall, so\r\nthat the admiral, judging the place to be in great danger, sent 7,000\r\nhorse and 8,000 foot to the city’s relief, September 7. It was fatal\r\nimpatience on Coligny’s part, for the action relieved Poitiers from the\r\ndanger of being taken.\r\n\r\nThere was now no other recourse for the Huguenots except to give\r\nbattle. But Coligny was unwilling to do this at once, desiring to wait\r\nuntil the devastation of the country round about still further reduced\r\nAnjou’s forces. In the interval he withdrew across the Vienne. But the\r\nmercenaries in both armies clamored for battle, for there was great\r\nwant of money on both sides, the King’s Swiss being unpaid for three\r\nmonths, the reiters five, the admiral’s also being behindhand for three\r\nmonths’ wages.[1362]\r\n\r\nOn September 30, at Moncontour, the two armies clashed in a preliminary\r\nengagement. But three days later on Monday, October 3, 1569, the real\r\nbattle was joined. It must have been an impressive and thrilling sight\r\nbefore the conflict began. In the Huguenot army the preachers moved\r\nabout encouraging the men, who sang the solemn psalms of the Calvinist\r\nworship with fervor. Across the plain, the Swiss and Germans in the\r\nroyal host, after the German fashion, knelt and kissed the ground.[1363]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF MONCONTOUR, OCTOBER 3, 1569 (Tortorel and\r\nPerissin)]\r\n\r\nAt the first shock it seemed as if the Huguenots would win, and they\r\ncried in exaltation, “Victory, victory! The Evangel has won the victory\r\nand has vanquished the mass of the popes. Down with the Papists!”[1364]\r\nThe admiral began the fray by charging Anjou’s center with 2,000\r\nreiters and such French gendarmes as he had, but was himself attacked\r\non the flank by the duke of Aumale and Villars so furiously that he was\r\ncompelled to fall back. The Protestant infantry which had followed\r\nthe horse into the battle, was thus left unsustained, and when the\r\nduke of Guise’s light horse charged, the lansquenets broke in flight,\r\nabandoning the artillery. In the midst of the melée various companies\r\nof reiters, seeing the battle lost, ran to their baggage, seized their\r\nmost valuable effects, and decamped in haste. Mansfeldt’s reiters\r\nalone fought well; the others were of slight service. Matters were\r\nlittle better with the hirelings of the King. Many of the leaders on\r\nboth sides were injured in the course of the battle; Guise in the hand\r\nand foot, Bassompierre, a German captain destined to become a very\r\nprominent man at court, in both arms; Anjou was borne to the ground\r\noff his horse but escaped injury; Coligny was hurt in the face by a\r\npistol-ball. Among the Catholic dead was Montbrun, captain of the Swiss\r\nguard. He was haughty and cruel, and a despot with his men, but it is\r\nto his credit that he sought to prevent the soldiery from abusing the\r\npeasantry.[1365] The most of the Huguenot dead were the German reiters\r\nand lansquenets, many of whom were killed by their Catholic compatriots\r\nor the Swiss, who distinguished themselves by their ferocity.[1366] The\r\nfight endured for four hours, from 11 until 3 o’clock, at the end of\r\nwhich time the forces of Anjou overthrew the admiral, routed both his\r\nhorse and foot, and captured his artillery and baggage. But for the\r\ngood fortune that some of Coligny’s horse intercepted a treasurer of\r\nthe King coming out of Limousin with 30,000 francs, the distribution of\r\nwhich among his reiters quieted their murmurs, Coligny might have been\r\nall but deserted by the German horse.[1367] As it was, he was able to\r\nfall back on Niort and thence make his retreat to the far south.[1368]\r\n\r\nFortunately for the Huguenots, the enemy did not attempt pursuit of\r\nthem, but instead undertook the siege of St. Jean-d’Angély, which lay\r\ndirectly in the way southward, to the disgust of the liberal marshal\r\nCossé and even Tavannes, who urged that the King, in the light of this\r\ngreat victory, might now make peace with good grace.[1369] Others,\r\nconsidering the strength of St. Jean-d’Angély thought that the war\r\nwould be protracted into the depth of winter and that the capture of\r\nSt. Jean-d’Angély would be of small importance while La Rochelle still\r\nremained. Instead of accepting the advice, the government hardened\r\nits policy. A reward of 50,000 crowns was offered for the head of\r\nColigny,[1370] 600,000 francs were distributed among the soldiers and\r\n300,000 sent into Germany to make a new levy against the spring.[1371]\r\n\r\nOn October 16 Charles IX arrived before St. Jean-d’Angély and beheld\r\nthe greatest part of the royal troops ranged in order of battle.\r\nAnticipating a desperate resistance upon the part of those in the\r\ncity, the King’s infantry requested to be equipped with the gendarmes’\r\ncuirasses. One incident will illustrate the desperate valor of the\r\nbesieged. On the night of October 21 they made a sortie, entered the\r\nenemy’s trenches, slew twenty men, took two ensigns prisoner, and all\r\nthe arms they found in the _corps de garde_, and returned into the\r\ntown. The Protestant garrison was not over 1,500 men, but in spite\r\nof the odds against him (he had no artillery except falconets and\r\nmuskets, while Anjou had eleven guns, great and small), the Huguenot\r\ncommander, Pilles, refused to surrender. Instead, when the governor\r\nof the town urged him to surrender rather than make resistance, the\r\ndesperate captain had him hanged and his body cast into the river.\r\nThe attack upon St. Jean-d’Angély opened on October 25, but although\r\nthe wall was badly battered, no sufficient breach was made for days.\r\nThe town resisted every attack until December 2, when it at last\r\nsurrendered.[1372]\r\n\r\nYet in spite of the double victory of Moncontour and at St.\r\nJean-d’Angély, hard experience was proving the wisdom of the course\r\nadvised by Tavannes and Cossé. The King was without money to pay the\r\nSwiss and the reiters who threatened to mutiny at any minute. The\r\ncountry round about the army was so denuded that there was great misery\r\nfor want of food and multitudes of the soldiers fell sick.[1373]\r\nFinally, on November 24, in a sitting of the King’s council, Charles\r\nIX was formally petitioned by certain of its members to make peace\r\novertures to his revolted subjects,[1374] and expressed his willingness\r\nto comply with the request.\r\n\r\nThe hand of the government was forced by events; the courageous\r\nresistance of St. Jean-d’Angély, Montluc’s action in resigning his\r\ncommission, and the growing strength of the Reformed among the southern\r\n“viscounts,” made the crown think eagerly of peace. As an earnest\r\nof this purpose, the King sent the liberal marshal Cossé in company\r\nwith De Losses, the new captain of the Scotch Guard, to La Rochelle\r\nto confer with the queen of Navarre and La Rochefoucault. But Jeanne\r\nd’Albret was not minded to use haste, to which the marshal meaningly\r\nrejoined that “there were many of rank in the Protestant army who\r\nwould not give her that advice.”[1375] Yet even if she had wanted\r\nto, the queen of Navarre could not have hastened a settlement. For\r\nat this time there was a real division of opinion existing between\r\nthe Huguenot nobles and the people of the Huguenot towns like St.\r\nJean-d’Angély and La Rochelle. The former class were weary of war and\r\nwanted to return to their homes and were in favor of peace and inclined\r\nto make their own terms, even to the extent of ignoring the claims\r\nof their coreligionists of the towns. The latter felt aggrieved at\r\nseeing themselves thus deserted, when they had done so much to maintain\r\nthe general cause of the Huguenots, not merely in contributing money\r\nbut by making such heroic resistance as that of the people of St.\r\nJean-d’Angély, and Jeanne D’Albret sympathized with them. She would\r\nnot listen to talk of peace, being firmly convinced that it was but\r\nanother ruse, like that at Longjumeau, and resolutely declared that\r\nthere would be time enough to consider terms of peace when their\r\nforces were more equal; that nothing short of the free exercise of\r\nthe religion as granted by former edicts would avail; that even if\r\nall the Huguenot nobles consented to the terms, her own signature and\r\nthat of Henry of Navarre would never be affixed to any half-way terms\r\nof pacification.[1376] But at last, after long debate, the queen of\r\nNavarre yielded, and sent the admiral’s future son-in-law, Teligny,\r\nwho had conferred with Coligny, to the King to request “a good assured\r\nand inviolable peace,”[1377] probably being in part influenced by the\r\ntreatment of St. Jean-d’Angély, whose garrison was suffered to march\r\nout, bag and baggage, with colors flying. The Huguenots demanded\r\nliberty of conscience, the restitution of their goods, estates, and\r\noffices to those of the religion, and the reversal of all sentences\r\nagainst them, together with guaranties for the observance of the\r\narticles.[1378]\r\n\r\nThe essential issue, and that which protracted the debate so long was\r\nthe demand for _chambres mi-parties_,[1379] and that the crown give\r\nover certain cities into the hands of the Huguenots to be garrisoned\r\nand governed by them alone. On February 3, 1570, the King replied,\r\npromising to grant amnesty for the past, the restoration of their\r\nestates and offices to the Huguenots, the expulsion of the reiters,\r\nwith liberty of the religion within private dwellings and in two towns\r\nwhich he would appoint.[1380] But Jeanne d’Albret, who conducted the\r\nnegotiations for the Huguenots, refused to be satisfied. In a long\r\nletter to the queen mother a week later she recapitulated the former\r\nnegotiations at great length and complained of the government’s want\r\nof good faith, especially alluding to the cardinal of Lorraine and the\r\nduke of Alva.[1381] As a matter of fact the government was not yet\r\nwilling to give in. The cardinal of Lorraine still hoped to hasten\r\nforward a new levy of reiters in Germany when spring should open, and\r\nheld out the vain hope of the restoration of the Three Bishoprics if\r\nthe Emperor would lend France this assistance and stay the Protestant\r\nlevies.[1382] But the Emperor himself had something to say about the\r\nmatter and asserted that he would not consider the proposed marriage\r\nof his daughter with the French King until peace was concluded in\r\nFrance.[1383] Aware of the Emperor’s attitude, the queen of Navarre\r\nresolutely demanded terms of peace in conformity with the demands of\r\nthe Huguenots.[1384]\r\n\r\nThe arguments of peace urged by the marshal Cossé and others who shared\r\nhis thought had less influence upon the King and his counselors as the\r\nstorm of war drove off toward the south,[1385] to the elation of Pius\r\nV, who overwhelmed Charles IX with protests against pacification.[1386]\r\nSouth of the Loire the principal interest of the third civil war is\r\nattached to the doings of that famous group of Huguenot warriors known\r\nas the “viscounts,” with whom Coligny had failed to connect before\r\nthe battle of Jarnac. A brief account of the earlier achievements of\r\nthis group, who sometimes fought together, sometimes separately, and\r\nhad three or four thousand footmen and three or four hundred horsemen\r\nin their command,[1387] is necessary at this point. There were ten\r\nof these captains: Bernard Roger de Cominges, vicomte de Bruniquel;\r\nBertrand de Rabastenis, vicomte de Paulin; Antoine de Rabastenis,\r\nvicomte de Montclaire; the vicomte de Montaigu; the vicomte de Caumont;\r\nthe vicomte de Parat; Geraud de Lomagne, vicomte de Sevignac (near\r\nBeaucaire), a brother of Terride, who was a Catholic and implicated\r\nwith Montluc in the project to deliver Guyenne to the King of\r\nSpain;[1388] the vicomte d’Arpajon; the vicomte de Rapin; and the\r\nvicomte de Gourdon.[1389] Three of these, and the most conspicuous,\r\nsave Rapin, the viscounts of Paulin, Bruniquel, and Arpajon were\r\nnatives of the diocese of Albi, a stronghold of heresy from mediaeval\r\ntimes; the first had seen service in Piedmont in the reign of Henry II,\r\nand the ancestors of all three of them had fought against Ferdinand of\r\nAragon in 1495.[1390] The viscount of Rapin was a leader of the great\r\nHuguenot rising in Toulouse in 1562, and was made Protestant governor\r\nof Montauban in 1564 by the prince of Condé.[1391] He was so bitterly\r\nhated by the people of Toulouse that he was accused of wanting to\r\ndestroy the city utterly and remove the very stones to Montauban. He\r\nhad fought in the second civil war, but was betrayed into the hands\r\nof the magistrates of Toulouse and condemned and executed there on\r\nApril 13, 1569, in defiance of the King’s orders to the contrary. The\r\nHuguenots took terrible reprisal for this outrage, devastating the\r\nenvirons of Toulouse for leagues around, even inscribing on the ruins\r\n“Vengeance de Rapin.”[1392]\r\n\r\nThese four viscounts were the nucleus of the group and began their\r\ncareer in the first civil war. But save Rapin, none became conspicuous\r\nthen. During the second war the others were drawn to the standard.\r\nThey operated in Languedoc and Quercy at first, aided by the peasantry\r\nwho seem to have turned toward them as natural enemies of the higher\r\nnobles.[1393] In the summer and autumn of 1568 their united hosts\r\nmade a mighty raid up the valley of the Rhone from Montauban through\r\nRouergue and the Cévennes, where part of the troops crossed the Rhone\r\nunder the viscount of Rapin and joined the Protestant army of Dauphiné\r\nand Provence under a former lieutenant of Des Adresse. The rest\r\nremained in Languedoc. Later Rapin recrossed the river into Vivarais\r\nwith the hope of joining the prince of Condé. But the governor of\r\nProvence, the count of Tende, aided by the viscount of Joyeuse, the\r\nCatholic general in these parts, blocked his passage. In the midst of\r\nthis plight relief came to the viscount of Rapin in the person of his\r\nformer comrade in arms. But at least Joyeuse had prevented the union of\r\nthe viscounts with the prince of Condé.\r\n\r\nThe people of Vivarais resented the occupation of the country by these\r\nguerrilla chieftains, much as their ancestors two hundred years before\r\nhad risen against the Free Companies during the reign of Charles V.\r\nThe towns organized an army of their own and distinguished themselves\r\nby routing the viscounts upon one occasion. In January, 1568, the\r\nviscounts succeeded in their early purpose, penetrated the Catholic\r\narmy and crossed the Loire at Blois. The relief of Orleans and their\r\nunion with the prince of Condé before Chartres hastened the peace of\r\nLongjumeau.[1394]\r\n\r\nDuring the interim between the armistice of Longjumeau and the outbreak\r\nof the third war, the viscounts, in common with most of the Protestant\r\nforces of the south, seem not to have disarmed, but stayed in the\r\nvicinity of Montauban, the Huguenot capital of the far south. When war\r\nwas renewed, Joyeuse and Gordes, governor of Dauphiné, unsuccessfully\r\ntried to keep the Huguenots east of the Rhone from joining them in\r\nLanguedoc. At Milhaud in Rouergue a great council of war was held at\r\nwhich practically all the Protestant fighting forces of the south save\r\nGuyenne and Gascony were represented.[1395] In conformity with the\r\nplan there arranged, the viscounts remained in Quercy and Languedoc\r\nwhile the main army crossed the Dordogne with the purpose of joining\r\nthe prince of Condé. But in Périgord it was met and scattered, on\r\nOctober 25, 1568, by the duke of Montpensier and Marshal Brissac.\r\nThe viscounts continued to operate in Languedoc against Joyeuse and\r\nothers. The success of their activities, especially the destruction\r\nof Gaillac (September 8, 1568) was what led to the revival of the\r\nleague at Toulouse under the cardinal of Armagnac on September 12, in\r\nthe cathedral of St. Etienne. The recall of Joyeuse with the Catholic\r\ntroops of Languedoc to the north to assist the duke of Anjou, left a\r\nclear field in Provence and Languedoc. The loss of Jarnac, March 13,\r\n1569, where the prince of Condé was killed, may in part be ascribed\r\nto the fact that the viscounts refused to respond to his orders for\r\nthem to come to him, so that the united forces of Anjou and Joyeuse\r\noverwhelmed the Huguenots. A similar reverse befell the Protestants on\r\nJune 8 following, in the Ariège near Toulouse, where Bellegarde, the\r\nseneschal of Toulouse, routed the viscounts and captured the viscount\r\nof Paulin, who would have suffered the fate of the viscount of Rapin,\r\nhad not Charles IX, less for magnanimity’s sake than to rebuke the\r\nparlement of Toulouse for violating the royal orders before, refused to\r\nhave him delivered up to it.[1396] The shattered bands of the viscounts\r\njoined Montgomery, a leader of their own kind, who had been detached by\r\nColigny from his own army, in the same month.\r\n\r\nThe reason for Montgomery’s appearance in the south is to be found\r\nin the peril threatening Béarn and Navarre at this time. Montluc had\r\nconceived the idea that Béarn might be conquered while its ruler was\r\nabsent. The parlement of Toulouse energetically favored the project\r\nand on November 15, 1568, had issued an _arrêt_ placing Béarn under\r\nits jurisdiction.[1397] In the early months of 1569 efforts were made\r\nwith some success to corrupt the captains in the Béarnais army.[1398]\r\nWhen the plan was broached to the duke of Anjou he enthusiastically\r\napproved it. The time was auspicious, for it so happened that the\r\nsuggestion coincided with his victory at Jarnac. Exactly a week after\r\nthe battle[1399] he detached the seigneur de Terride with instructions\r\nto report to Montluc, for the duke thought Montluc could not be spared\r\nfrom Guyenne.[1400] This order was a bitter disappointment to Montluc,\r\nwho wanted to conquer Béarn himself, and he ever thereafter cherished a\r\nhatred against Marshal Damville[1401] who was away from his government\r\nat the time with the duke of Anjou, believing that Damville’s jealousy\r\nof him was responsible for it. This may very probably have been so,\r\nfor, as will be seen later, the enmity between the two was extreme.\r\n\r\nTerride’s campaign began well. One by one, in rapid order, the\r\nfortified towns of Béarn collapsed before him—Pontacq, Morlaas,\r\nOrthez, Sauveterre, and Pau—the birthplace of Henry of Navarre, while\r\nthe country round about was wasted with fire and sword. The queen of\r\nNavarre’s lieutenant was driven to find refuge in Navarrens, whose\r\nchâteau, reputed to be impregnable, had been built by Henri d’Albret\r\nduring his enterprises against Spain. On April 27, 1569, Terride began\r\nthe siege of the castle of Navarrens.[1402]\r\n\r\nMontgomery, who arrived at Castres on June 21[1403] bearing the double\r\ncommission of the two Protestant princes,[1404] in the course of four\r\nweeks found himself in the neighborhood of Toulouse and at the head of\r\nthe united forces of the viscounts and some levies made in Albigeois.\r\nMontgomery’s energy amazed Montluc who was soldier enough to give his\r\nenemy credit for really wonderful achievement. He had never been in\r\nthe country before and all the forces he had brought with him were\r\nthree score and ten horses, and he had no other forces but those of the\r\nviscounts in the beginning. He had to cross the Garonne river, too,\r\nthe entire length of which was watched by spies. The belief of the\r\nCatholic captains in Languedoc was that Montgomery intended to organize\r\nthe defense of the places the Protestants were possessed of, and this\r\nerroneous opinion seems to have been given currency by the Huguenots\r\nthemselves, “who had ever that quality to conceal their designs better\r\nthan we,” testifies Montluc. “They are a people that rarely discover\r\ntheir counsels, and that is the reason why their enterprises seldom\r\nfail of taking effect.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF THE FORTRESS OF NAVARRENS MADE BY JUAN MARTINEZ\r\nDESCURRA, A SPANISH SPY\r\n\r\nIn Archives nationales, K. 1499, No. 84.]\r\n\r\nBy rapid marching Montgomery reached Navarrens incredibly soon.\r\nTerride, his soldiers wearied out by a siege which had endured for\r\nthree months and a half in midsummer, loaded with spoil, licentious\r\nand mutinous to an extent that shamed even the reiters, abandoned the\r\nsiege and fell back on Orthez. But the city was not proof against the\r\nattacks of the viscounts. In broad daylight the walls were carried\r\n_par escalade_. On August 13, Terride, who had taken refuge in the\r\ncastle with so much haste that he was without provisions or munitions,\r\nsurrendered. He himself was spared by Montgomery for the purpose of\r\nbeing exchanged for the latter’s brother, but died before the transfer\r\nwas made. His captains, almost to a man, were put to death. Some of\r\nthese were former officers in the Béarnais army and were legally guilty\r\nof treason, but the real motive of Montgomery was reprisal for the\r\nravages done by Terride’s army. At the beginning of the war the queen’s\r\nlieutenant, the heroic baron de Larboust, either in the hope of sparing\r\nBéarn, or anticipating what would be meted out again, had proposed to\r\nneutralize Béarn, putting it into the custody of the count de Grammont,\r\neven offering to oppose Montgomery if it were done. Terride refused\r\nand paid the price of his wilfulness and bigotry. Béarn was saved by\r\nMontgomery, in the most brilliant and most honorable campaign of his\r\ncheckered career.[1405]\r\n\r\nThe Catholic failure to conquer Béarn goaded Montluc’s slumbering\r\nhatred of Damville to fury, for he believed the utter collapse of the\r\nProtestant cause would have followed the conquest.[1406] He blamed\r\nDamville for it, asserting that Terride’s overthrow was due to his\r\nslowness. But the marshal had had great difficulty in returning to his\r\ngovernment. The Huguenots were in full possession of Quercy and the\r\nAlbigeois, and the region around Toulouse was so much overrun by them\r\nthat Damville was unable to reach Toulouse until the end of June.[1407]\r\nIt took Montgomery even with the viscounts immediately at hand, nearly\r\nfive weeks (June 21-July 27) to prepare for the relief of Navarrens,\r\nthough the desperate condition of things there required haste, and with\r\nthe entire civil as well as military burden of Languedoc upon him,\r\na burden that necessarily had accumulated, too, during his absence,\r\nDamville could hardly be expected, with justice, to have got ready\r\nto go against Montgomery before the middle of August, by which time\r\nthe siege of Navarrens was over. The truth is, Montluc and Damville\r\nradically disagreed as to the policy to be pursued in the south.\r\nMontluc’s patent covered the territory of Guyenne only. But Montluc,\r\nwith a mere soldier’s disregard for forms of law, believed that it\r\nwas a soldier’s duty to go where the need was greatest. He made the\r\nproposal that when Damville should have won a town in Languedoc he\r\nwould come to attack another in Guyenne. To this the marshal demurred,\r\nasserting that it was his duty to attempt to recover what had been\r\nlost in his government and pointed to his commission. Montluc derided\r\nthe plea and accused Damville of being so proud “a grand lord, son to a\r\nconstable and a marshal of France,” that he would not work with a poor\r\ngentleman.[1408]\r\n\r\nIn the late summer (1569) Montgomery victoriously returned from Béarn,\r\nhaving reached the highest point of his reputation. Within six weeks\r\nhe had gathered an army, marched leagues through a strange and hostile\r\ncountry, crossed the Garonne and raised a siege against equal forces,\r\nand turned the Catholic conquest of Béarn into defeat. It seemed a\r\ndream both to friend and foe. Nobly did his enemy say: “In all the\r\nwars there never was performed a more notable exploit.” If Montgomery\r\nhad failed, Coligny would have had no place to retire to after the loss\r\nof Moncontour. For he came from that field of Protestant overthrow\r\nwith the relics of an army only, mostly gentry and reiters, for the\r\ninfantry was almost all cut to pieces or captured, without baggage,\r\nwithout money, even the horses needing to be reshod. It was well that\r\nthe admiral could throw himself into the arms of Montgomery and the\r\nviscounts who enriched him with the spirit of their success and drew\r\nthousands, literally, to the Huguenot standard by the magic of their\r\nachievements. His following increased so rapidly that by the time\r\nhe reached Montpellier he again had between ten and twelve thousand\r\nmen.[1409] On January 3, 1570, Coligny and Montgomery united their\r\nforces. The dissension between Montluc[1410] and Damville gave them\r\nand the viscounts almost unrestrained freedom in Upper Gascony and\r\nLanguedoc, where they grew enormously rich on the spoils of war, and\r\ncarried their depredations to the very walls of Toulouse which was\r\nactually invested from January 22 to February 20, 1570.[1411]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Voyage of the Princes after the\r\n  Battle of Moncontour Oct. 1569 July, 1570\r\n  in blue ——\r\n\r\n  Montgomery’s Itinerary in\r\n  Bigorre and Gascony, July-Nov. 1569\r\n  in black ——\r\n\r\n  Union of Coligny and Montgomery in\r\n  Dec. 1569 at Port St. Marie.\r\n\r\n  ——}\r\n  ——} Conjectured route\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen the news of Terride’s downfall was known to Montluc he made\r\novertures to Damville in spite of his resentment. A council of war was\r\nheld at Auch, but instead of coming himself the marshal sent Joyeuse to\r\nsay that he thought it his duty to pass his time in his own government,\r\nconsidering the charge the country was under to sustain the war. It\r\nis interesting to observe the ancient ideas of provincial separation\r\nand autonomy asserting themselves at this time. In vain Montluc argued\r\nthat the real enemy was in Guyenne and that the local hostility of the\r\nHuguenots in Languedoc was a little matter in comparison; that all\r\nCatholics were equally the King’s subjects and that the country was the\r\nKing’s.[1412] Joyeuse answered that the estates of Languedoc would not\r\npay for Montluc’s army unless he employed their money in recovering\r\nthe places in their province. The decision abandoned Guyenne, leaving\r\nit alone and single handed, for the King’s forces were engaged in the\r\nprotracted siege of St. Jean-d’Angély and could not come to its relief.\r\n“J’ay tousjours ouy dire que plus près est la chemise que la robbe,”\r\nsaid Montluc satirically.[1413]\r\n\r\nThe old man was on the point of discharging his army and retiring\r\nto Libourne or Agen, but the duty of a soldier forbade him. If he\r\nnow abandoned the open country in so critical a condition, it would\r\never have been a reproach to him. He thought better of himself and\r\nattacked Mont-de-Marsan instead, where he placated his outraged\r\nfeelings by refusing the petition of the garrison to capitulate and\r\nsecretly gave orders for the massacre of the entire number save\r\nthe captain, Favas.[1414] This feat of arms insured the future of\r\nGascony and the Landes, for the city served as a granary for all the\r\nsurrounding country from whence, however, to the detriment of France,\r\nmuch grain was exported to Spain.[1415] After this exploit, feeling\r\nthe impossibility of maintaining his forces in the field, Montluc\r\ndisbanded his army, sending his son to Lectoure and himself retiring to\r\nAgen. It goaded him to the quick that the crown approved throughout of\r\nDamville’s conduct and either ignored his own complaints, or criticized\r\nhim for what he had done. “I was born under a planet to be ever subject\r\nto calumny,” he growled. “Age deprives a man of his heat: for in my\r\nyounger days the greatest prince upon earth could not have made me\r\nswallow such a pill.”\r\n\r\nIt may have been that Damville had friends at court and Montluc none;\r\nit may have been that the marshal’s pride of long descent made him\r\nindifferent or even contemptuous of Montluc in some degree. But if we\r\nlook closely at things it is evident that the spirit of provincial\r\nseparation was the fundamental source of the difficulty between them.\r\nThis spirit penetrated to the very bottom. Both Montluc and Damville\r\nwere making war with men levied from the country in which they\r\nwere—with militia instead of regular troops. The consequence of this\r\nwas that every man in the host had an eye to the welfare of his family\r\nor his friends instead of to the King’s business; moreover, many had\r\nrelatives or friends with the enemy, which made them fight reluctantly;\r\nfinally, they were ill-paid and had to subsist on plunder, which\r\ndebauched discipline. The true remedy would have been for Charles IX to\r\nhave raised the useless siege of St. Jean-d’Angély and to have come in\r\nperson into the southland, where the authority of the King might have\r\novercome the local forces of separation; and where the regulars would\r\nhave plied war as a trade, as the circumstances demanded.\r\n\r\nThe Catholics of the south had an example before their eyes in the\r\nreiters with the admiral, of the efficiency of regular troops over\r\nlocal forces. Coligny owed his future to them and Montgomery. The\r\nway the reiters made war excited the admiration of trained soldiers\r\nlike Montluc. They so barricaded the villages in which they quartered\r\nthemselves that nothing was to be got by assault and in the open\r\ncountry they were always mounted at the least alarm. It was very hard\r\nto surprise them. They were careful of their horses and arms and so\r\nterrible in action “that a man could see nothing but fire and steel.”\r\nThe very grooms fought.[1416]\r\n\r\nThe reverses experienced at Poitiers, Moncontour, and St. Jean-d’Angély\r\nhad not been fatal to the Protestants. In the middle of December\r\nColigny wrote to the captain of La Charité that he felt ready to resume\r\nthe offensive in the spring, having in La Rochelle, Cognac, Angoulême,\r\nMontauban, Castres, La Charité, and Montpellier a chain of impregnable\r\nfortresses extending from the seaboard clear to the heart of France,\r\nand controlling the Loire.[1417] A survey of the map will show the\r\nstrength of the Huguenots in this part of France. All of Provence and\r\nLower Languedoc was in full control of the Protestants, Montauban,\r\nAlbi, and Castres, constituting a line of defense on the west. In Upper\r\nLanguedoc they were not so strong and the condition of the Catholics\r\nwas less precarious, since Toulouse, Auch, Agen, and Cahors, formed a\r\nquadrilateral in the very center. The Huguenots controlled many of the\r\nlesser towns, so that Montluc complained that time and again he had to\r\npass through their hands “and for the least affair trot up and down\r\nwith great trouble from city to city. Would to God that, as they do in\r\nSpain, we had made our constant abode in the good towns; we had then\r\nboth more riches and more authority.”[1418]\r\n\r\nGuyenne was safely Catholic if it could continue to hold its own; for\r\nthis important fact Montluc richly deserves credit.[1419] But Guyenne,\r\nGascony, and Upper Languedoc were isolated from the Catholic north by\r\na broad Protestant strip running southeastward from La Rochelle to\r\nMontpellier through Saintes, Cognac, Angoulême, Chalais, Bergerac,\r\nMontauban, Albi, Castres, Béziers, and Montpellier, which united\r\nSaintonge on the seaboard with Provence and Dauphiné. But, on the\r\nother hand, Béarn was separated from the main trunk of Calvinism and\r\nwas not yet safe, in spite of Montgomery’s success, unless it were\r\nbound to the main trunk. The Huguenot leaders realized this, and one\r\nof Coligny’s adroitest strokes, after Moncontour, was the seizure of\r\nPort-Ste. Marie, below Agen on the Garonne, with the aid of the German\r\nreiters.[1420] The capture of this place (November 29, 1569) insured\r\nthe passage of the Garonne to the Huguenots[1421] and accomplished\r\nfor those of the far south what the possession of La Charité insured\r\nto those of central France, for it bridged the Garonne. Later, when\r\nBernard d’Astarac, baron de Martamot, early in the following January\r\n(1570) recovered Tarbes[1422] on the Adour, the Huguenots had a chain\r\nof fortresses running straight north from Béarn through Condom and\r\nNérac to Bergerac and Angoulême, and Catholic Gascony and Guyenne were\r\ncut in twain.\r\n\r\nMontluc, having fortified Agen, the capture of which would have been\r\nanother disaster to the Catholics, then set to work to contrive how\r\nto break the bridge of boats which Coligny had constructed. A mason\r\nwho had once built a floating mill for the marquis de Villars above\r\nPort-Ste. Marie came to him and suggested loading the mill with stone,\r\ncutting it loose, and letting it float down stream with the hope of\r\nbreaking the bridge. The Garonne at this time was swollen with winter\r\nrains. The leaders were skeptical of the scheme, as the bridge was\r\nknown to be protected by heavy cables above stream. But the captain\r\nThodeas, an engineer with Montluc, supported the mason, after secretly\r\nsurveying the structure. The novel battering-ram accomplished the\r\nwork intended. Shortly before midnight the mill was loosed from its\r\nmoorings, one of the soldiers being drowned in unchaining it. Coligny’s\r\nartillery, when it loomed through the darkness, made a desperate\r\nattempt to sink it by fire from the batteries at either end of the\r\nbridge, but in vain. The mill struck the bridge with such a shock that\r\ncables, chains, and boats all went to pieces with a crash. Two of the\r\nboats went down as far as St. Macaire and some, it was said, were\r\npicked up as far down as Bordeaux.[1423]\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the bridge was a heavy blow to the Protestants for\r\nit cut their forces into two parts. Besides Montgomery, very many of\r\nthe reiters were caught on that side of the river toward Gascony. But\r\nColigny’s enterprise robbed adversity of its sting. He improvised a\r\nbridge of two boats, upon which five or six horses could be carried\r\nat once, the boats being hauled by cable, after the Italian manner.\r\nIt required an hour and a half to go and return, yet at last, with\r\ngreat pains and difficulty the whole company of reiters was got across\r\nstream. Montluc had proposed to Candale and La Valette that an attack\r\nbe made upon Montgomery who was quartered at Condom, south of Nérac.\r\nBut they were so slow in responding that Montgomery, too, was able to\r\npass over, first his horse and then his foot, one after the other, it\r\nrequiring five or six days for all his forces to make the transit.[1424]\r\n\r\nBut the admiral and Montgomery followed up this clever deed by a\r\nblunder so bad that the Reformed suffered for it for years afterward,\r\nand were saved from losing Béarn, perhaps, as they had almost lost it\r\nbefore, by the intervention of the Peace of St. Germain. Coligny’s\r\noriginal plan was to pass the rest of the winter and until harvest\r\nin Gascony and Guyenne, with Port Ste. Marie as his base and to have\r\nheavy artillery brought from the fortresses of Béarn with which to take\r\nall the towns upon the Garonne as far as Bordeaux. The bridge assured\r\nthem control of two of the richest provinces of France, for they were\r\nabsolute masters of the field. By this means Bordeaux would have been\r\nat their mercy, for the sea power of the Huguenots at Blaye[1425] was\r\nsufficient to close the city upon the sea side. It could not have held\r\nout for more than three months, for already corn was selling there at\r\nten livres per sack. Bordeaux itself was rich and strong but situated\r\nin a barren country, so that, deprived of the Garonne and Dordogne, it\r\ncould presently be reduced to famine. As for the Protestant army it\r\nwould have fared well. The lesser towns like Libourne and Lectoure must\r\ninevitably have succumbed with their stores, and the viscounts were in\r\nfull possession of Comenge and Loumaigne, the most fertile counties\r\nof all Guyenne. There were numerous stores of grain here, for it was\r\na practice of the dealers and even gentlemen, to accumulate three or\r\nfour years’ store in anticipation of a dear year. Had the Huguenots\r\nonce got Bordeaux in their clutches, they might have boasted that they\r\nhad the best and strongest angle of the kingdom, both by land and\r\nsea, commanding five navigable rivers. The bridges over the Charente\r\nat Saintes and Cognac, being in their hands, no one could pass from\r\nSaintonge to Bordeaux where La Noue lay, “as valiant a man as any that\r\never was in France.” The river system of the southwest—the Charente,\r\nIle, Dordogne, Lot, and Garonne—could have been made to bind the whole\r\nregion into a compact whole if this plan had been carried out, and from\r\nbehind these natural barriers the Protestants might have defied all the\r\nKing’s armies.\r\n\r\nYet although Coligny’s army tasted of Bordeaux wine and his reiters\r\nwatered their horses in the Garonne, he did not go on. He failed to\r\nsee that the most vital need of the Huguenots was to gain complete\r\nmastery of the sea. This is what La Noue perceived and Coligny did\r\nnot. After the loss of Rouen they had but one important port town at\r\ntheir command, La Rochelle, which the blunders of the government in\r\nthe second civil war had permitted the Protestants to make their own,\r\non which depended Brouage, reputed the fairest and most commodious\r\nhaven in all the kingdom, and the chief staple for salt in all the\r\nsouthwest.[1426]\r\n\r\nThe sequel to such a course, it is true, must probably have been the\r\nerection of the southwest of France into an independent state. Such a\r\nresult, looking at the France of today, is repugnant to our feelings.\r\nBut we must look at things as they were then and judge accordingly\r\nand without prejudice. In the first place, it is to be remembered\r\nthat in Béarn there was already the nucleus of such a state to build\r\nupon; and secondly that Guyenne and Gascony for centuries had been\r\npossessions of another sovereignty, and that their attachment to\r\nFrance was barely over a century old. In the sixteenth century it was\r\nimpossible to divorce religion from politics and the only solution\r\nwas the separation of those which disagreed on matters of religion,\r\nas the division between the Protestant Dutch and the Catholic Flemish\r\nprovinces in 1578-79 proves. The Peace of Augsburg had laid down the\r\nprinciple _cujus regio, ejus religio_, and no other policy could have\r\nprevailed in Germany at that time. But France was trying to make a\r\nmonarchy, institutionally and necessarily Catholic, adapt itself to two\r\nreligions, which could not be done as long as politics and religion,\r\nchurch and state, were united. Even after twenty-eight years more of\r\nstruggle, neither the trial and experience of all those years nor the\r\ngenius of Henry IV ever made the Edict of Nantes anything more than a\r\n_modus vivendi_ which first proved intolerable to the Huguenots because\r\nof their own political ambitions, and finally to the monarchy of Louis\r\nXIV, whose motto was as truly: “Un roi, une loi, une foi” as it was\r\n“l’état, c’est moi.” The French monarchy in the nature of things, in\r\nthe sixteenth century, could not be one-half Catholic and one-half\r\nProtestant, any more than the United States, as Lincoln said, could\r\nexist one-half slave and one-half free. What France would have lost\r\nby the creation of an independent state in the southwest would have\r\nbeen compensated for by other gains in other ways. Such a state in\r\nsouthwest Europe would have been an effective agency for peace, in the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It not only would have relieved\r\nits Catholic neighbors of the religious dissidents within their\r\nborders; it would have been a checkmate upon the undue aggrandizement\r\nof either France or Spain, operating like Holland and Switzerland as\r\na buffer state and for the maintenance of the balance of power. The\r\nSpanish marriages of France in the next century probably never would\r\nhave been, with their attendant train of dynastic and territorial\r\ncomplications during the reign of Louis XIV. The Grand Monarque perhaps\r\nnever would have conceived the thought of browbeating the rest of\r\nEurope, and certainly never would have been able to carry the idea out\r\nto the extent he did.\r\n\r\nIn abandoning his original plan in January, 1570, Coligny not merely\r\naltered the immediate future of France; perhaps he changed its destiny\r\nfor centuries to come. Instead of securing peace and security for the\r\nHuguenots by cutting the Gordian knot and establishing an independent\r\nHuguenot state, with Béarn as its cornerstone, he threw the solution\r\nof the question back upon France. He had dreamed of a Huguenot France\r\nbeyond sea. Why not one at home? Instead Coligny had become possessed\r\nwith the idea that neither the King nor his ministers would seriously\r\nthink of peace as long as the war could be kept confined to provinces\r\nremote from Paris and therefore, in order to force the hand of the\r\nKing, it was necessary to force war upon him in the very heart of the\r\nkingdom. In other words, he conceived a new design, namely, to throw\r\nthe war into the center of France once more, to march upon Paris, and,\r\nbefore its gates, dictate the terms he desired.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this new policy, the army of the admiral and the\r\nviscounts, with Montgomery, moved up the Garonne. Toulouse was invested\r\nfor a month (January 22-February 20, 1570), as we have seen, without\r\nsuccess and the country fearfully wasted.[1427] Want of provisions\r\nfor men and horses at the end of this time compelled the host to\r\nmove toward Carcassonne and Montréal.[1428] As the country between\r\nMontpellier and Avignon was almost totally in control of the Huguenots,\r\nColigny soon moved thither, whence he followed up the right bank of the\r\nRhone to Vivarais and Forez. Illness overtook him here and he was in\r\ngreat danger.[1429] For a time it seemed certain that fate would call\r\nLouis of Nassau who had joined him from Orange, to the leadership of\r\nthe army.[1430] By the time of the admiral’s recovery, it was time for\r\naction if his design was to be executed, for things were in a greater\r\nstate of doubt and uncertainty regarding the peace than ever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUGUENOT ATTACK UPON A CATHOLIC CHURCH\r\n\r\n(Bib. Nat., Estampes, _Histoire de France_, Q. b)]\r\n\r\nThe prospect of peace darkened as the winter began to break and\r\npreparations in both camps grew more active. In February the marshal\r\nCossé prepared to expel the Huguenots from La Charité in order to\r\ndeprive them of their only means of communication across the Loire\r\nRiver, by which assistance could be brought from Germany. This place\r\nhad been one of the cities demanded from the government as pledge\r\nof good behavior, but the crown was determined not to yield in this\r\nparticular. Queen Elizabeth had strongly assured the King that she\r\nhad not directed nor licensed any of her subjects to carry arms\r\nor munitions to La Rochelle, but guarded herself against possible\r\ncompromising evidence being discovered in future by adding that\r\nshe “generally must permit merchants to resort indifferently to\r\nFrance.”[1431]\r\n\r\nWhile the negotiations thus dragged on through March and April,[1432] a\r\nnew element of excitement was introduced by the conduct of the reiters\r\nin the Catholic army. These adventurers, many of whom were Protestant\r\nin faith, tired of idleness and determined either to renew the war or\r\nsecure their wages, on April 17 sent the King an address in which,\r\nin the same breath, they asserted their loyalty to Charles IX and\r\ntheir belief that those of the Reformed religion were only fighting\r\nfor liberty of conscience and the preservation of their lives. Though\r\nguardedly put, reading between the lines, this memorial implied peace\r\nat once or immediate renewal of the war. Coincident with this manifesto\r\nthe princes of Navarre and Condé joined in a note to the King declaring\r\ntheir resolution never to yield. To these causes of disaffection must\r\nbe added the further one that many in the rank and file of the Huguenot\r\nparty believed that the Protestant leaders were seeking to serve their\r\nown ends more than the common good; and accused them of being more\r\nanxious for the preservation of their privileges than for the free\r\nexercise of religion.\r\n\r\nMatters continued thus to hang fire for several weeks. The King went\r\nto Mont St. Michel in the middle of May to keep the feast of Corpus\r\nChristi there, where, while professing his desire to conclude the\r\npeace, Charles IX nevertheless imposed a tax of 60,000 francs monthly\r\nupon those who had failed to bear arms in the late conflict. At the\r\nsame time there was a large exodus of nobles from the court, many\r\ngentlemen, weary of long service in arms, soliciting and securing\r\nleave to retire. The talk of peace, too, continued to be current in\r\nthe court,[1433] although Charles IX’s secret dealings with Montluc,\r\nthe alienation of 50,000 _écus de rente_ of the property of the\r\nchurch,[1434] and the fact that the marshal Cossé at this same time\r\nadvanced out of Orleans with 2,000 horse and 4,000 French footmen and\r\nwas soon joined by 8,000 Swiss and 30 companies of men-at-arms belied\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nMontluc had been on the point of resigning his commission for months\r\npast on account of the friction with Damville, but repented when there\r\nwas prospect of the liberal marshal Cossé succeeding him, fearing\r\nlest, with another such as Damville, the Catholic cause throughout\r\nthe south would be ruined.[1435] He still clung to the hope of seeing\r\nBéarn conquered notwithstanding Terride’s failure, and in June, 1570,\r\nthe opportunity seemed to have come. With the aim of diverting the\r\nwar from the Ile-de-France, and throwing it into the provinces once\r\nmore—the farther the better—Charles IX grasped at a new expedition\r\nagainst Béarn. Montluc was given the commission.[1436] Notwithstanding\r\nhis years and his infirmity and the penury of the government, which\r\nhad neither munitions nor money to spare, Montluc managed to raise a\r\nconsiderable force.[1437]\r\n\r\nHe had resolved to besiege the little fortified town of Rabastens, near\r\nTarbes, which he had chosen as the point of attack because he could\r\ndraw upon Gascony for supplies from this place more easily than by\r\nbeginning at St. Severs, which bordered on the Landes, “a country only\r\nfruitful in sands.”[1438] But the expedition came to an untimely end.\r\nIn an unguarded moment Montluc exposed himself and “a harquebus-shot\r\nclapt into his face” with such force as to break his whole visage in,\r\nso that the cheek-bones were taken out in splinters. The town was\r\ntaken, nevertheless. How it suffered may be read in the words of him\r\nwho meted out its punishment.\r\n\r\n My Lieutenant, who had marcht on the one hand of me when I went on\r\n to the Assault ... came to see if I was dead, and said to me: “Sir,\r\n cheer up your spirits, and rejoyce, we have entred the Castle, and the\r\n Soldiers are laying about them, who put all to the sword; and assure\r\n your self we will revenge your wound.” I then said to him, “Praised\r\n be God that I see the Victory ours before I dye. I now care not for\r\n death. I beseech you return back, and as you have ever been my friend,\r\n so now do me that act of friendship not to suffer so much as one man\r\n to escape with life.” Whereupon he immediately returned and all my\r\n servants went along with him, so that I had no body left with me but\r\n two Pages, Monsieur de Las, and the Chirurgeon. They would fain have\r\n sav’d the Minister, and the Governor, whose name was Captain Ladon, to\r\n have hang’d them before my Lodging, but the Soldiers took them from\r\n those who had them in their custody, whom they had also like to have\r\n kill’d for offring to save them, and cut them in a thousand pieces.\r\n They made also fifty or threescore to leap from the high Tower into\r\n the Moat, which were there all drown’d. There were two only saved who\r\n were hid, and such there were who offer’d four thousand Crowns to save\r\n their lives, but not a man of ours would hearken to any Ransom; and\r\n most of the women were kill’d who also did us a great deal of mischief\r\n with throwing stones. There was found within a Spanish Merchant whom\r\n the Enemy had kept prisoner there, and another Catholick Merchant\r\n also, who were both saved; and these were all that were left alive\r\n of the men that we found in the place, namely the two that some one\r\n help’t away, and the two Catholick Merchants. Do not think, you who\r\n shall read this Book, that I caused this slaughter to be made so much\r\n out of revenge for the wound I had received, as to strike terror into\r\n the Country, that they might not dare to make head against our Army.\r\n And in my opinion all Souldiers in the beginning of a Conquest ought\r\n to proceed after that manner, with such as are so impudent as to abide\r\n Canon; he must bar his ears to all Capitulation and Composition, if he\r\n do not see great difficulties in his Enterprize, and that his Enemy\r\n have put him to great trouble in making a Breach. And as severity\r\n (call it cruelty if you please) is requisite in case of a resolute\r\n opposition, so on the other side mercy is very commendable, and fit,\r\n if you see that they in good time surrender to your discretion.[1439]\r\n\r\nSince his assumption of the command at La Rochelle La Noue had\r\ndisplayed an energy that drove the enemy to despair. On land and on sea\r\nhe became a terror to them. Sometimes it was by arresting the King’s\r\ngalleys and bringing them as prizes to La Rochelle or Brouage;[1440]\r\nsometimes it was by driving them out, as at Rochefort, by digging a\r\ntrench which poured waters waist deep down upon them; sometimes it\r\nwas by battle in the open field. La Noue outmatched Puygaillard at\r\nevery point, notwithstanding that his antagonist had the King’s picked\r\ntroops. In the plain of Ste. Gemme, near Luçon, their armies clashed\r\nin a fierce, stubbornly fought engagement. Nearly all the captains\r\nof his enemy’s two regiments and 500 arquebusiers were killed and as\r\nmany more taken prisoner. The brilliant captain at last won, although\r\nhe was so badly injured by an arquebus shot in the left arm that\r\namputation was necessary. Yet in the hour of his own intense suffering\r\nhe magnanimously lamented “the death of so many brave gentlemen.”[1441]\r\n\r\nMuch more decisive than this engagement, however, was Coligny’s\r\naction. The admiral had been lingering at Montbrison in Auvergne\r\nduring May for the purpose of guarding the upper Loire.[1442]\r\nAlarmed by the formidable army under the marshal Cossé, Coligny\r\nnow determined to strike suddenly and hard in order to preserve La\r\nCharité. This resolution precipitated the battle of Arnay-le-Duc on\r\nJune 15, 1570.[1443] The result of this victory was startling. The\r\ngovernment capitulated almost at once. All the essential terms of\r\npeace had been thrashed over during the spring and in less than a\r\nweek after the battle Charles IX held in his hands the articles of\r\npacification demanded by the Huguenots, chiefly stipulating for the\r\nfree exercise of religion within three towns in every province and\r\nat Charenton, amnesty for the past and restitution of offices and\r\nestates. But the crown flatly refused the right within ten miles of\r\nParis, or even for Protestant noblemen attending court in their own\r\nchambers and offered two towns in each province instead of three. When\r\nthis was refused it was finally settled to adopt August 1, 1570, as\r\nan _annus normalis_, and permit Calvinist worship to be held in all\r\ntowns in the possession of the Huguenots on that date. The two points\r\nof contention still unsettled were the payment of the reiters and\r\ndetermination of the surety-towns. The government at first proposed\r\nthat the payment of the reiters be equally apportioned between the\r\nsubjects of both religions, but finally shouldered the burden. As to\r\nthe surety-towns—the most important point of all as far as practical\r\npolitics was concerned—great difficulty was experienced before\r\nagreement was made. The King at first offered to yield La Rochelle,\r\nAngoulême, and Montauban, and to trade Perpignan or Lansac for La\r\nCharité.[1444] Later, Angoulême was withdrawn and Cognac substituted,\r\nto the displeasure of the Huguenots, and La Charité definitely yielded.\r\nAs to other matters, namely, restitution of honors, offices, estates,\r\nprivileges, equality of justice, amnesty, release of prisoners, and\r\nthe like, these of course were provided for, and Protestant nobles\r\nenjoying “high justice” were to be permitted to enjoy free exercise\r\nof the Calvinist faith, including baptism in their houses, for their\r\nfamilies, and all others in their dependence,[1445] an evidence that\r\nthe feudal element in the Huguenot party was more considered than the\r\nbourgeoisie.[1446]\r\n\r\nThe papal nuncio, understanding that the Huguenots had demanded the\r\nexercise of their religion in the counties of Verre and Avignon, which\r\nbelonged to the Pope, declared that no peace could be made with those\r\nwho were outside of the church.[1447] At the same time the Spanish\r\nambassador, being informed that it was part of the Huguenot programme\r\nto secure the restitution of William of Orange and his brother Louis\r\nof Nassau to their French possessions, also protested warmly against\r\nthe peace. Spain offered direct assistance to France of men and\r\nmoney, and the city of Paris and the clergy offered to maintain the\r\nwar at their own expense for eight months longer. But these protests\r\nwere ineffectual. The Spanish ambassador’s mouth was stopped by the\r\nrejoinder that the French King had as much right to make a treaty of\r\npeace with his subjects as Philip of Spain had to make terms with the\r\nMoriscos,[1448] and so, though apprehensive of French and German\r\nProtestant assistance being given to Orange and fearful of an attack\r\nupon Franche Comté, the Spanish ambassador was forced to be content\r\nwith the promise of France that no hostility was intended or would be\r\npermitted in France toward Spain.\r\n\r\nThe Peace of St. Germain was the broadest and most substantial body of\r\nprivileges yet secured by the French Protestants. Antedating the Edict\r\nof Nantes by twenty-eight years, it might have been as great and as\r\npermanent an instrument as the latter, if the ambition of the Guises\r\nand the intervention of Spain in French affairs had not overthrown\r\nit. France itself, government and people, was tired of ten years of\r\nstrife and disposed to peace. The economic interests of the country\r\nwere anxious for peace. Only zealots for the religion and those who\r\nsought to fish in troubled waters reprobated the terms of St. Germain\r\nand sought to continue the struggle. It is true that mutual suspicion\r\nstill prevailed. Some of the Huguenots anticipated new encroachments\r\nagain, destructive of the peace, and that the King only aimed to\r\ndisarm the Protestants in order to overwhelm them later. But time, in\r\nall probability, would have qualified this feeling. Religion, unless\r\nartificially exaggerated, had ceased to be the primary issue of France\r\nby 1570. The real issue was Spain. For all parties alike in France\r\nhad begun to chafe because of the power acquired by foreign military\r\ninfluences, especially that of Philip—a feeling which ultimately was\r\ndestined to unite the country on the basis of a national patriotism\r\nand embolden Henry of Navarre to expel the Spaniard and establish the\r\nBourbon throne on a truly national basis.\r\n\r\nAn incident which took place at the court in mid-July, when the terms\r\nof peace were under consideration, illustrates this all but universal\r\nhatred of Spain. One day the Spanish ambassador entered the King’s\r\nchamber for audience. Soon afterward the marshal Tavannes came in, who\r\nwas somewhat deaf and accustomed to speak in a loud voice. Perceiving\r\nthe ambassador he gruffly remarked in a voice so audible as to be heard\r\nby Alava:\r\n\r\n These Spaniards would do better to govern their own members and not\r\n interfere by trying to govern other people’s countries. For I well\r\n know that the Spaniards have no wish but to foment civil wars, so\r\n that both one party and the other may be weakened and they themselves\r\n become stronger than both. For my own part, I would rather see a\r\n hundred white capes [the Huguenot costume] than one red cross [the\r\n device the Spaniards wore]; because, after all, the first are our\r\n brethren and our kindred, while the latter are the natural enemies of\r\n our country.[1449]\r\n\r\nIt was an opportune time for France to undertake an anti-Spanish\r\npolicy, and it was soon predicted that she would follow such a\r\ncourse.[1450] Aside from the discomfiture of the Guises owing to the\r\npeace, a condition which peculiarly discountenanced the cardinal\r\nof Lorraine, the duke of Guise was in disgrace also. For he was\r\ndiscovered to have made overtures of marriage to Madame Marguerite,\r\nthe King’s sister, and the lady herself for whom a Portuguese match\r\nwas being considered as a blow to Spain, was reputed to have expressed\r\na preference rather to stay in France than “to eat figs in Portugal.”\r\nGuise, when the discovery was made that he had raised his eyes to\r\nthe princess, hastily attempted to divert suspicion by marrying the\r\nprincess of Porcien. But the episode injured the influence of the\r\nGuises, and brought Montmorency forward as the man of the hour.[1451]\r\n\r\nUnder the new régime, the government set about carrying out the terms\r\nof pacification, enforcement of which chiefly depended upon the upright\r\nand just conduct of the four marshals.[1452] By the end of September\r\nthe camps were wholly broken up and the reiters either over or on\r\ntheir way across the frontier.[1453] To be sure, radical Protestants\r\ncontinued to complain of infractions of the edict.[1454] But the one\r\nserious infraction of the edict was in the fifteenth article, providing\r\nthat all scholars, the sick and the poor, should be received in the\r\nuniversities, schools, and hospitals without difference or distinction\r\non account of religion. The Catholic party, in the hope of abridging\r\nthe development of the competing religion soon persuaded the King to\r\nnullify this provision. In compliance with a petition praying that the\r\ncrown would forbid any of the Reformed religion from holding any post\r\nof authority in the University of Paris, and also that the university\r\nauthorities might have power to search for and seize all heretical\r\nbooks, Charles IX on October 8, 1570, issued a proclamation forbidding\r\nany Calvinist from holding any office or teaching in the University\r\nof Paris and giving the authorities thereof the right of search for\r\nheretical books.[1455] On November 20, this was followed by a more\r\nsweeping decree forbidding any persons from keeping schools or holding\r\noffice in any college, or lecturing on any art or science in public or\r\nin private unless recognized and approved by the Roman church.[1456]\r\nNevertheless, these petitions, complaining of infractions of the edict,\r\nwere more smoke than fire. The only internal issue of great importance\r\nwas an economic one.\r\n\r\nApart from the destructiveness of the war, nature again dealt hardly\r\nwith France in this year. There were heavy rains over all Europe\r\nwhich either rotted the grain in the fields or washed it out. A great\r\ninundation of the Seine occurred on June 2, 1570, and the plague began\r\nto grow more virulent once more.[1457] There was a certain amount of\r\nreason in the demand for a new session of the Estates to consider\r\nthe economic distress of France, but the King was wise in refusing\r\nthe request, for in event of its meeting, the enemies of Spain would\r\nhave been sure to endeavor to fan the ashes of the late civil war\r\ninto flames again. As a solace to those demanding economic relief\r\nCharles IX promised to abolish sundry superfluous offices and to tax\r\nthe nobles instead of the commons for the relief of his debts which\r\namounted to 37,000,000 francs. An earnest of this intention is manifest\r\nin an ordinance requiring parish wardens to keep accounts and to\r\nmake a declaration of the revenue of their churches and to send this\r\ninformation to the royal bailiffs. Every parish was forced to obey this\r\nedict, which was a novelty indeed. But the parish authorities took\r\nadvantage of the situation and not merely rendered an account of their\r\nincomes, but also gave the King a minute account of the ruin they had\r\nsuffered at the hands of the Huguenots. The bailiffs received these\r\ndeclarations and sent them to the Privy Council of the King, where the\r\nevidence was reviewed and every church taxed accordingly. The churches\r\nwhich had been burned by the Protestants were lightly taxed, and those\r\nwhich were found to be incapable of payment were authorized to sell\r\ntheir possessions, their vessels, jewels, or lands, or else impose a\r\ntax on the parish.[1458]\r\n\r\nBut the thrifty bourgeoisie of France were too lucrative a source of\r\nincome for the King to keep his promise not to tax them more. In March,\r\n1571, an edict was issued providing that bolts of woolen cloth should\r\nbe sealed with a leaden seal before sale, and that each bolt should be\r\ntaxed 3 francs, 4 deniers. The new impost, which was very unpopular,\r\nwas ascribed to the Italian influence at court.[1459]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE MASSACRE OF ST. BARTHOLOMEW\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dominant politics of France in the years 1570-72 were foreign, not\r\ndomestic, and had to do with Spain. The clouds hung heavy over Spain’s\r\ndominions in spite of the suppression of the Moriscos, and dark was the\r\nprospect ahead for Philip II. In the east only was light. The great\r\nvictory at Lepanto over the Turks, fought on October 7, 1571, though of\r\ngeneral benefit to Christendom, was of greatest advantage to Spain.\r\n\r\nIt is at this juncture that the duke of Anjou, the King’s brother,\r\nbecomes a conspicuous political figure, one, indeed, of international\r\nimportance. In order to confirm the confidence of the Huguenots, but\r\nespecially to strengthen France against Spanish preponderance, the idea\r\nwas again put forward of marrying Anjou to Queen Elizabeth.[1460] At\r\nthe same time the plan was broached of marrying young Henry of Navarre\r\nto the sister of the duke of Württemberg. But again Montmorency came to\r\nthe forefront and revived the plan suggested in 1569 of marrying the\r\nprincess Marguerite, Charles IX’s youngest sister, to Henry of Navarre.\r\nColigny for the Huguenots, and Walsingham and Norris for England,\r\nurged the double plan.[1461] The Ridolfi plot proved to Elizabeth that\r\nEngland, like France, had her greatest enemy in Spain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MASSACRE OF ST.

The\r\n windmill stands on Mont Sainte Geneviève.]\r\n\r\nThe consternation of the Guises and Spain at the discovery of this\r\ndouble marriage project was great. The Guises sought to break the\r\nproposed marriage of Anjou and Queen Elizabeth by offering him Mary\r\nStuart, and that of Henry of Navarre with the King’s sister by offering\r\nthe cardinal d’Este as a prospective husband, since he was universally\r\nexpected to succeed his brother, the duke of Ferrara who was without\r\nissue. Tuscan influence was used to this end. Spain and the papacy,\r\nfor their part, dangled before the eyes of the duke of Anjou the post\r\nof command over the fleet preparing against the Turks.[1462] The gulf\r\nbetween France and Spain, however, was too wide to be bridged by such\r\nan offer. Disappointed at Bayonne, Catherine was dreaming of the elder\r\ndaughter of the Hapsburgs as the future wife of Charles IX. Such a\r\nmarriage appealed to her as a practical way of playing one house of\r\nHapsburg against the other, although she plausibly represented it as a\r\nnew tie that would bind France and the Hapsburgs in greater amity.[1463]\r\n\r\nThe counter-claims of France and Austria to the Three Bishoprics, and\r\nthe renewal by France of her former relations with Turkey, retarded\r\nthis negotiation.[1464] The greatest hindrance, though, was the\r\nopposition of Philip II. It was with the object of frustrating the\r\ndesigns of France that Philip II had transferred his ambassador in\r\nFrance, Chantonnay, from Paris to Vienna.[1465] At Bayonne, the queen\r\nmother had exerted all her influence in vain to prevail upon the court\r\nof Spain to commit itself. When Fourquevaux succeeded St. Sulpice at\r\nMadrid, he, in turn, continued to urge that Charles IX should marry\r\nthe princess Anne; that Marguerite of Valois should marry Don Carlos,\r\nand Henry of Anjou the infanta Juana, Philip’s sister. But Philip II\r\nstill hesitated between Mary Stuart and Anne of Austria, and suggested\r\nthe younger daughter of Maximilian as prospective spouse for Charles\r\nIX.[1466] Matters remained thus undetermined for years. The marriage\r\nof Mary Stuart to Darnley in 1565 and the death of Don Carlos in July,\r\n1568 raised Catherine’s hopes. But they were dashed to pieces after\r\nthe death of Elizabeth of Valois, on October 3, 1568, when Philip II\r\nhimself became the suitor for the hand of Anne of Austria. French and\r\nSpanish diplomacy thereafter plotted and counterplotted, until in 1570\r\nthe French King had to endure the chagrin of seeing his expected queen\r\nbecome the fourth bride of Philip of Spain and himself be satisfied\r\nwith the younger sister, whose physical charms[1467] did not compensate\r\nfor the injury to his pride.[1468]\r\n\r\nBut Philip gained another point of advantage over the French King, a\r\npoint which the latter never discovered. The duchy of Lorraine, was a\r\nfief of the empire and had been so ever since the Middle Ages. Situated\r\nin the penumbra between France and Germany, the duke of Lorraine’s\r\nposition had become a complex one and he was a vassal of France for\r\nthe border duchy of Bar. As a sign of his amity toward the Emperor,\r\nCharles IX at the time of his marriage agreed to release the duke of\r\nLorraine from his fealty to France. This waiver stirred the patriotic\r\nindignation of the keeper of the seal, Morvilliers, who resigned his\r\noffice, declaring that he would not be an agent for separating from the\r\ncrown of France any principality owing allegiance to it. Unfortunately\r\nfor the future, the King appointed a secret partisan of Spain to the\r\npost. This was Biragues, a Milanese by birth, whose sinister influence\r\nwas to play no mean part in the future.[1469]\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, the winter and spring of 1571-72 were filled with\r\ncross-negotiations of great importance. The greatest Catholic-Spanish\r\nfear was lest a positive alliance be made between France, England, and\r\nHolland, and perhaps the Protestant German states for the liberation\r\nof the Netherlands, that league to have greater binding force through\r\nthe double marriage of the duke of Anjou and Queen Elizabeth and Henry\r\nof Bourbon to Marguerite of France.[1470] Spain, to prove France, made\r\nfinal demand of Charles IX: namely, that he forcibly suppress the\r\nactivity of the prince of Orange in France; that Spain be permitted\r\nto levy Catholics in France to serve in the Low Countries; that\r\nFrance restrain the preparations of the Huguenots, especially those\r\nof La Rochelle, from aiding the Dutch cause on the sea; that France\r\nrenounce her alliance with Turkey and join the Holy League against the\r\nOttoman; and finally, that Charles IX abandon the project of marrying\r\nhis sister to the prince of Navarre. Charles IX’s replies were very\r\nvague. To the first of these demands he replied that his country was\r\ntoo much exhausted by the late wars to take up arms for any cause; to\r\nthe second he said that if he permitted Catholic levies to be made in\r\nFrance, the Huguenots would not believe them to be for service abroad\r\nbut would again take up arms; as to the preparations at La Rochelle,\r\nit remained to be seen if their purpose was not mercantile instead of\r\nmilitary.[1471]\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the various parties in France toward the crown’s\r\nSpanish policy was a peculiar one. The Huguenots and moderate Catholics\r\nof course urged the marriage of the King’s brother to Queen Elizabeth\r\nwith the greatest zeal. But even intense Catholics, like Tavannes,\r\nsingular as it seems, urged the match, with Machiavellian ingenuity\r\nestimating that the King, by incurring the deeper enmity of Spain,\r\nwould be compelled to avail himself of their services, and thus, in the\r\nend, the cause of Catholicism in France would be promoted.[1472] The\r\nqueen mother, with characteristic caution, professed much inclination\r\nfor the match, but urged that it could not be attempted without\r\nhazarding the King’s honor. Meanwhile Montmorency, pushed it with all\r\nhis ability, alternately urging Catherine de Medici and Lord Burghley\r\nby an assiduous correspondence.[1473]\r\n\r\nHow purely political as an issue religion had become by this time in\r\nEurope is made almost cynically manifest in the conferences between the\r\nadvocates of the French-English match for the purpose of overcoming the\r\nreligious disparities represented by the principals in the proposed\r\nmatch. From the beginning of the negotiations it was evident that\r\nevery compromise made in religion would have to be made by France. The\r\nincongruities of age and religion and the complications of politics\r\nwere great. The hardest thing, perhaps, to estimate, is the influence\r\nof Elizabeth’s vacillation. Catherine de Medici, on the whole, seems to\r\nhave been anxious for the match. So protracted and so intricate were\r\nthe negotiations that the duke of Anjou, with mingled prejudice and\r\ndespair, declared that “all was but dalliance.”[1474] It was speciously\r\nurged upon the duke that no attempt was being made to effect his sudden\r\nconversion to the Anglican religion, but that he should forego the use\r\nof private mass, and “examine whether he might not with good devotion\r\nuse the forms of prayers appointed throughout her realm, the same being\r\nin effect nothing but that which the Church of Rome uses, saving that\r\nit is in the English tongue, which, if he pleased, might be translated\r\ninto French; and further, that the usage of the divine service in\r\nEngland did not properly compel any man to alter his opinion in the\r\ngreat matters being now in controversy in the church.”[1475] To this\r\nit was rejoined that “religion was a constant persuasion confirmed by\r\ntime” and that “relenting in religion, being a matter of conscience,\r\nwas an inconvenience of more weight than any that might happen to\r\nthe queen.”[1476] For a while Anjou, although after the Edict of\r\nSt. Germain he had staunchly protested that no preaching be allowed\r\nanywhere in his territories—which the King granted—wavered between\r\npolicy and conscience. One day while visiting Madame Carnevalet, the\r\nwife of his tutor, he said with affected gaiety: “Carnevalet, thou and\r\nI were once Huguenots, and now again are become good Catholics.” “Aye,”\r\nshe said, “we were so, and if you proceed in the matter you wot of, you\r\nwill then return to be a Huguenot.”[1477]\r\n\r\nSpain did everything possible to thwart the negotiation. Her ambassador\r\nin the presence of the King’s council inveighed against the plan,\r\nasserting that the kingdom of France was going to ruin, but he was\r\ncautious not to allege any ground but that of religion.[1478] Finally\r\nthe counter-practices of the Guises and the Spanish ambassador, partly\r\nby appeals to religious scruples and partly by the means of lavish\r\npromises, overcame Anjou’s hesitation and he flatly refused to consider\r\nthe marriage.[1479] The King was furious. “Brother,” he said, “you\r\nshould have used some plainness with me in this matter and not leave\r\nme to wade so far to abuse a prince I so much esteem and honour. You\r\nallege conscience to be the cause but I know it is a late pension\r\noffered unto you by the clergy, who would have you still remain here\r\nfor a champion of the Catholic faith. I tell you plainly, I will have\r\nno other champion here but myself, and seeing you have such a desire to\r\nremain here on such respects, it behooves me the more narrowly to look\r\nto you; and as for the clergy, seeing they have so great superfluity,\r\nand I so great necessity, the benefices being at my disposition, I will\r\ntake a new order; and as for those who make the offer, I will make some\r\nof them shorter by the head.”[1480]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, despite the fact that the cause was a lost one, the\r\nmatter was protracted so long that the negotiators of the affair\r\nthemselves perceived the humor in it. Elizabeth protested that “of\r\nherself she had no mind thereto, yet the continual crying unto her\r\nof her Privy Council, the necessity of the time, and the love of her\r\nsubjects, had turned her mind to marriage,” while the duke of Anjou\r\nreasserted his belief in his future damnation if he yielded anything\r\nin the matter of religion. Smith, the English envoy, solemnly averred\r\nthat “the matter of religion would be the most honourable to break off\r\nwith,” both for his mistress and the duke, and in the same breath asked\r\nwhether it would suffice if the duke were suffered for a time to have\r\nhis mass private in some little oratory or chapel—this so that there\r\nshould be no scandal to any of the Queen’s subjects. The queen mother\r\nreplied that the duke must have the exercise of his religion open, lest\r\nhe should seem to be ashamed of it, and that he was now of late so\r\ndevout that he heard two or three masses every day, and fasted the Lent\r\nand vigils so precisely “that he began to be lean and evil-coloured,”\r\nso that she was angry with him and told him that she “had rather he\r\nwere an Huguenot than be so foolishly precise to hurt his health.” She\r\ntold the English ambassador that he would not be content to have his\r\nmass in a corner, but insisted upon “high mass and all the ceremonies\r\nthereof according to the time, and in song after all solemn fashion\r\nof the Roman church, and a church or chapel appointed where he might\r\nopenly have his priests and singers and use all their ceremonies.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Madame,” ejaculated Smith, “then he may require also the four\r\norders of friars, monks, canons, pilgrimages, pardons, oil and cream,\r\nrelics, and all such trumperies. The queen of England will never agree\r\nto any mass, let alone great high mass, with all the ceremonies of Rome\r\naccording to the season, priest, deacon, subdeacon, chalice, altar,\r\nbells, candlesticks, paten, singing men, ‘les quatre mendiants et tous\r\nles mille diables’”—at which tirade all but Anjou laughed.[1481]\r\n\r\nIt is at this moment that the duke of Alençon comes forward into\r\nthe light around the throne. Since the duke of Anjou was “so\r\nextraordinarily, papistically superstitious”[1482] both sides turned\r\ntoward him, notwithstanding the absurd disparity between his age and\r\nthat of Queen Elizabeth. Even Elizabeth’s hardy modesty blushed at the\r\nthought of such a match,[1483] and the objection of inequality in their\r\nages was backed up by guarded expressions of repugnance on account of\r\nthe disfigurement the young duke had suffered from smallpox.[1484]\r\n\r\nThe Huguenot pressure eagerly supported the proposed marriage between\r\nQueen Elizabeth and the duke of Alençon, for the duke was as easy in\r\nreligion as his brother was straight.[1485] The admiral Coligny urged\r\nit upon Lord Burghley, pointing out that it would strengthen the treaty\r\nof Blois,[1486] while others urged that England would have a practical\r\nadvantage from the fact that Alençon was as rich in lands as his\r\nbrother, and that the duchy of Alençon adjoined Normandy, where the\r\nwhole of the nobility was devoted to the duke, and hoped by his means\r\nto be restored to their ancient privileges and liberties, and that\r\nthen England could make “a bulwark and defense” out of Normandy for her\r\nown protection.[1487]\r\n\r\nIt is a difficult story to take seriously, for each one of the actors\r\nfelt its hollowness and unreality. One feels that it was a gigantic\r\nbubble produced by English and French councilors of state to amuse and\r\noccupy each other by its brilliancy and wavering instability. Yet the\r\ngreatest statesmen in England were driven nearly to distraction by\r\ntheir endeavors to keep it in the air. At first this diplomatic affair\r\nassumes an almost farcical comedy aspect: then it darkens into tragedy.\r\nIt is a game of chess in which the players are grave and reverend\r\nstatesmen and the pieces queens and princes, with this distinction,\r\nthat the pieces are always likely to move of themselves and create\r\nunexpected combinations. Yet, for all its hollowness, the story\r\ndeserves attention, for as long as it lasted it absorbed the attention\r\nof the persons concerned, and it illustrates most admirably Elizabeth’s\r\nand Catherine’s tortuous methods of diplomacy.\r\n\r\nWhen the negotiations began, Elizabeth was already thirty-eight years\r\nold and of vast experience in promoting and then avoiding marriages.\r\nAs a coy and bashful damsel, she could always plead her repugnance to\r\nthe marriage state, and as the head of a Protestant nation, religion\r\nwas another rock of refuge when anxious or angry suitors pressed her\r\ntoo closely. She had fooled Philip and she had kept the poor Austrian\r\narchduke gamboling before her. What could the pockmarked François\r\nd’Alençon expect but disaster? Yet it was he who came the nearest to\r\npinning her down to a state of matrimonial stability.\r\n\r\nThe two things in Catherine’s character which seem to be especially\r\nprominent in this tale of love and lying are her thirst for power for\r\nherself and a mother’s natural ambition for her children.\r\n\r\nAlençon’s appearance is the one thing about him which is seriously\r\ndiscussed. He was born 1555 and was therefore twenty-two years\r\nyounger than Elizabeth. This was, of course, an enormous objection,\r\nor, at least, one which could always be urged. His age is the official\r\nand public objection, but his face and stature affected Elizabeth\r\nfar more.[1488] As to his character we have the testimony of the\r\nEnglish and Venetian ambassadors. Smith, in January, 1572, calls him\r\n“a good fellow and a lusty prince” and says “he is not so obstinate,\r\npapistical, and restive like a mule as his brother is.” Dale, in the\r\nquaint letter in a Hatfield MS says of him: “As touching his behavior\r\nhe ys the most moderate yn all the court; never present at any of the\r\nlicentious acts of his brethren, nor here nor at Rochelle; of much\r\ncredit, and namely with them of the religion; thus he ys and hath ben\r\nhetherto; what may be hereafter God knoweth.” On the whole, the English\r\nambassadors favored him, Walsingham the least. Evidently he was not an\r\nunpleasant person, but a young and inexperienced lad, ambitious to do\r\ngreat things, resenting his treatment at the court, and so plunged into\r\nthe current of things, only to be deceived and ruined by the superior\r\ncunning of his supposed friends. His shortcomings may be excused on the\r\nground of his environment and bringing up; may even be praised as being\r\nmore manly and significant than the effeminate Henry.\r\n\r\nAlençon’s motives in attempting to win Elizabeth are obvious. His\r\nposition in France was most unpleasant to him: suspected by his\r\nbrothers, made fun of and pestered by the Guises and the “mignons” of\r\nthe court; condemned to a life of subordination and idleness by the\r\naccident of his birth, the prospect of the hand of the Queen of England\r\nseemed most glowing, even though she was a heretic and more than twenty\r\nyears older than he. But why should Catherine and Elizabeth ever\r\nconsider such an intrinsically absurd proposition?\r\n\r\nElizabeth was face to face with several problems, foreign and domestic,\r\nupon the solution of which depended her throne and her very existence.\r\nIt is hard to remember as one looks back upon her long and splendid\r\nreign that there was hardly a moment in it when she was free from the\r\ndanger of overthrow and execution. This danger, at this time, had just\r\nmanifested itself in the Ridolfi plot in which the duke of Norfolk,\r\nthe greatest noblemen of England, Spain, Mary Stuart, and the Pope had\r\nall combined. Naturally the Catholic nobles rallied around Mary, the\r\nprobable successor to the throne, while the Protestants were at a loss\r\nto know what to do in view of the unsettled succession. So great was\r\nthe excitement that Elizabeth always hesitated to call a Parliament\r\nfor fear it would attempt to urge her on to marriage. Negotiations,\r\nnot to speak of marriage, with France would immensely relieve the\r\nsituation. They could be used before Parliament to show that Elizabeth\r\nwas doing her best; hopes of a settled succession would at once\r\nreassure the country and diminish Mary’s importance, both as a center\r\nof conspiracy and as a source of danger in other ways. To be sure, this\r\npossible marriage might excite the Catholics to renewed efforts to\r\nsave their faith, but the fact that France was Catholic and that from\r\nit might come much of their help would militate against disturbance.\r\nNegotiations might bring about most of these results and would in any\r\ncase gain time and postpone the solution of the difficulties.\r\n\r\nA second problem before Elizabeth was the maintenance of the Protestant\r\nfaith. So far as this enters the negotiations it is mostly a pretext,\r\nbut there was, nevertheless, an actual problem. Negotiations for\r\nmarriage with a Catholic prince might stir up the Catholics to renewed\r\nactivities and raise hopes which it might be difficult to allay, but,\r\non the other hand, Elizabeth could hope for relief from the Huguenot\r\nmovement in France, and the rebellious Dutch, while the alliance with\r\na Catholic prince would immensely strengthen her in her own middle\r\nground. To allow him to bring the mass with him might cause trouble,\r\nbut still one prince could not do much when queen and council were\r\ncarefully watching him.\r\n\r\nScotland was another source of continual anxiety to the English\r\nministry. The government was unsettled and the power likely to\r\nfall at any time into the hands of those who would turn it over to\r\nFrance. Of course this danger would be entirely removed by a French\r\nmarriage, though as events proved, negotiations did not stop the\r\nintrigues. A similar point of attack existed in Ireland where the least\r\nencouragement was sure to raise rebellion. A French marriage would make\r\ndanger in that quarter also less likely.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the greatest source of danger was from Spain. There were\r\ncountless reasons why Philip should declare war—religion, the seizure\r\nof his treasure by Elizabethan seamen, the treatment of Mary (though\r\nthis did not at first much concern him), and Spanish repression in\r\nthe Netherlands. English negotiation with France would be of value to\r\nEngland, if for nothing else, in keeping France and Spain apart. It\r\nwas hoped, moreover, that once England and France were united, the\r\ncombination might check Philip in his dealing with the Netherlands and\r\nthe English Catholics and in the cruelties visited on Englishmen in\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nBut there were grave objections to a marriage. It would introduce a\r\nnew and unknown element into English councils. Suppose, as a Catholic,\r\nthe King should join that party; or worse, ally himself with Mary\r\nherself, plot the death of Elizabeth and a Catholic restoration. Or\r\nsuppose he should become king of France? or that his child should be\r\nheir to both thrones? The thought of becoming a French dependency was\r\nintolerable to England. In any case it would mean a break with Spain\r\nand how could England be sure that France was not merely tempting her\r\nto that, finally to leave her to face Spain alone? Plainly, marriage\r\nwas too close and dangerous a union—as for negotiations, that was\r\nanother matter, and it was simply for the negotiations themselves\r\nthat Elizabeth entered upon them. This is proved, I think, by her\r\nentire policy. Whenever France seems most willing she draws away; but\r\nwhen France seems likely to abandon such fruitless endeavors, she\r\nat once becomes affable and yielding. Sometimes her ministers urged\r\nher to definite and decided action, but she always managed to find\r\na loop-hole, if either they or circumstance had forced her into too\r\ndangerous agreement.\r\n\r\nFrance, on the other hand, could not be content with mere negotiations.\r\nShe, too, had several definite problems. Rent by civil war, with\r\nenormously powerful barons on the one side and a clamorous people\r\non the other, while outside the realm stood Spain and England, only\r\ntoo glad to promote and foster her difficulties, the crown was in a\r\nstruggle for existence as real as that of Elizabeth. To join Spain\r\nwould be for France to lose her integral existence and to be swallowed\r\nup in the maw of the Hapsburgs. Therefore the English alliance was\r\nthe only refuge. Besides there were many other advantages. It would\r\nstop England’s meddling in French affairs and would calm and reassure\r\nthe Huguenots. But there was the rub: did the Huguenots need to be\r\nreassured? Could France safely commit herself to a liberal policy? To\r\nCatherine it was not so much that, as the question of her own authority\r\nand personal ambition for her family; she had no intention of giving\r\nplace to the Huguenots any more than she had to the Guises. And so she\r\nwavered when the Guises were becoming too powerful, and helped along\r\nthe marriage; when the Huguenots began to be too authoritative, she\r\nfrowned on it.\r\n\r\nTo the Huguenots the marriage was a question of enormous advantage—if\r\nit were accomplished, the Calvinists might hope, not only for success\r\nin France, but in the Low Countries as well; while to the Guises, on\r\nthe contrary, the alliance meant the ruin of their hopes for Mary and\r\nfor absolute dominion in France.\r\n\r\nBut to all the risk was great. Elizabeth was by no means firmly seated\r\nupon her throne and seemed to be manifesting a reckless carelessness\r\nin the leniency of her treatment of the late conspirators. The English\r\nambassadors noted that any “roundness” of treatment at home at once\r\ncaused a quickening of the negotiations. The real objection, both with\r\nFrance and with England, was fear of duplicity. Neither could trust the\r\nother. Each insisted that the other should commit itself first; neither\r\nwould consent, with the result that all came to naught. This was just\r\nwhat Philip expected. Naturally a French-English league would have\r\nseriously hampered him, but he had found by long and trying experience\r\nthat when Elizabeth talked of marriage, she was only amusing herself\r\nwith a polite fiction. Not once does he take the matter seriously. So\r\nthe Spanish attitude was one of unconcern, which in itself added to the\r\nfear of both Elizabeth and Catherine, for each supposed some secret\r\nunderstanding with Spain on the part of the other.\r\n\r\nWith such motives and in such troubled waters the negotiations went\r\non. In the end Elizabeth could not “digest the inconvenience” of the\r\nproposed marriage, and failing to cement the new friendship of France\r\nand England by this form of alliance, it was then suggested that a\r\npolitical compact, not a marriage alliance, be made between the two\r\npowers.[1489] But there were great difficulties in the way of this\r\nproject. For, although the English desired a closer union with France,\r\nthey were nevertheless not unprepared to treat with Spain, and to use\r\nthe prospective alliance with France for the purpose of bringing Philip\r\nII to terms. England was unwilling yet to be considered as an open\r\nenemy of Spain, in spite of the fact she was well aware of Alva’s plot\r\nwith Lord Seton and other Scotch and English refugees in Flanders.[1490]\r\n\r\nTrade considerations were of great influence in governing this\r\nattitude. England could not afford to forfeit her commercial\r\nintercourse with Spain and Flanders for the none-too-sure friendship of\r\nFrance, since the staple in Flanders was worth between two and three\r\nmillions.[1491] France could not offer any staple or port advantages\r\nto England comparable with those England enjoyed elsewhere.[1492]\r\nEngland accordingly proposed that the league be extended to include\r\nthe Protestant princes of Germany and that they should join together\r\n“in defense against any who for matters of religion should use force\r\nagainst any of them;” secondly, that France would bind herself not to\r\nsupport the cause of Mary Stuart in Scotland; and thirdly, that France\r\nwould not seek any greater trade advantages in the Low Countries than\r\nshe had in former times. France balked at the proposed extension of\r\nthe alliance to Germany and it was dropped; as to Scotland, she was\r\nwilling to make a partial sacrifice of honor for the sake of political\r\nadvantage.[1493]\r\n\r\nBut England’s fear of contributing to the aggrandizement of France was\r\ntoo keen to permit her to have free rein in the Netherlands,[1494]\r\nthough Walsingham proposed a way to prevent the possibility of French\r\nascendency there, and declared that the grandeur of France abroad was\r\nless to be feared by England than the continuance of civil war in\r\nFrance or the destructive policy of Alva in the Netherlands.[1495]\r\nBurghley was as cautious as his mistress. “If the sea-ports fall into\r\nthe hands of the French,” he wrote, “they will regulate not only the\r\ncommerce of our merchants abroad but the sovereignty of the Channel,\r\nwhich belongs to us.”[1496] The jealous determination of England to\r\nmonopolize the commerce of the Low Countries was, the greatest obstacle\r\nto the formation of the alliance. For England most of all feared lest\r\nFrance would not content herself with Flanders and Artois.[1497]\r\n\r\nIn the delicate business of state which burdened him at this season,\r\nCharles IX showed more acumen than either his new-found friends of\r\nProtestant faith or the Catholics had expected to find, because while\r\nexerting himself to keep the peace with Spain on the one hand, on the\r\nother he endeavored to conciliate his Protestant subjects. Unlike his\r\nelder brother, Francis II, Charles IX was of strong physical frame,\r\nbeing big boned and vigorous, until the fatal taint of his heritage\r\nand his excesses undermined his constitution[1498] and brought on the\r\ndisease of consumption of which he died. He was gross, even brutish\r\nin inclination, rejoicing in base physical sport and disinclined to\r\nbooks.[1499] But in the present politics Charles IX showed little\r\nof the rashness of his physical nature.[1500] Nevertheless the King\r\nwent farther than caution approved in dealing with his new-found\r\nfriends. He would have disarmed the suspicion of Spain, and the\r\nGuises[1501] to some degree, at least, if he had drawn close to the\r\nduke of Montmorency, whose moderate Catholicism, however impeachable,\r\nwas not the detested heresy of the French Protestants. But instead of\r\nso doing, the King, unable to dissemble as much as his mother, openly\r\nmanifested a great admiration for the admiral Coligny, than whom\r\nneither the Guises nor Spain had a more resolute foe. The admiral was\r\nreceived in Paris upon his arrival there early in September, 1571, with\r\ndistinguished honors.[1502] His popularity with the King was at once\r\na menace and a challenge to Philip II and the Guises.[1503] An added\r\ndifficulty, as the result of this policy, was that Catherine de Medici,\r\nseeing her son so well affected toward the admiral, grew jealous of the\r\nlatter’s influence, lest it supplant her own, and intrigued against him.\r\n\r\nDespite the failure of the marriage alliance, France still had two\r\nstrings to the Ulysses bow she was drawing against Spain—support\r\nof the Dutch, and the union of France by means of the marriage of\r\nHenry of Navarre and the princess Marguerite. Spain’s suspicions\r\nthat the Huguenot naval preparations at La Rochelle were in favor of\r\nthe Dutch[1504] had not been based on groundless suspicion. William\r\nof Orange’s own brother, Louis of Nassau, had remained in France\r\nafter the Peace of St. Germain, urging an alliance between France\r\nand England against Spain,[1505] or else French intervention in the\r\nNetherlands.[1506] The count of Nassau enlarged upon the vast designs\r\nof the Spanish monarch and showed how sinister they were to France as\r\nwell as Holland, artfully alluding to the peace of Cateau-Cambrésis,\r\n“a peace dishonorable to France;” he dwelt upon the tyranny of Alva\r\nand the horrors of the inquisition; he demonstrated that all the\r\ninhabitants of the Low Countries, both Catholics and Protestants,\r\nhated the Spanish domination; that all the maritime towns were ready\r\nto receive French and Dutch garrisons, if but those of Spain could be\r\ndriven out; that with the sea-power of France thrown into the scale,\r\nthe Dutch could conquer Spain; and finally proposed the formation of\r\nan international league to overthrow Spain, and asserted that France\r\nmight acquire Flanders and Artois and the empire Brabant, Guelders, and\r\nLuxembourg as reward of their services. So alluring was the prospect\r\nportrayed to Charles IX that he almost cast off the mask he wore of\r\npretended friendship for Spain.[1507] He told Philip’s minister,\r\nAlava, than whom “there was no prouder man or one more disdainful in\r\ncountenance”[1508] when the ambassador complained to the French King\r\nthat certain ships of the prince of Orange were being harbored at\r\nLa Rochelle,[1509] that “his master should not look to give laws to\r\nFrance.”[1510]\r\n\r\nMeantime the proposed marriage of Henry of Navarre to Marguerite,\r\nthe King’s sister, progressed. A full year before the nuptials were\r\nconcluded, the jewels and apparel for the ceremony were already\r\nprovided. The difficulty of arranging a religious form for the\r\nceremony acceptable to both Catholics and Protestants was the great\r\nhindrance.[1511]\r\n\r\nAgain Spain made unavailing protest. Henry of Bourbon still bore the\r\ntitle of king of Navarre, though the kingdom had been lost to the house\r\nlong before his birth and was, in fact, entirely in the possession of\r\nSpain. Her fear was lest the new bond of marriage might unite the\r\nparties of France in war for the acquisition of Navarre. It was in\r\nvain, however, that Spain sought to prey upon the fears of Charles IX,\r\nendeavoring to excite the King’s jealousy against the growing power\r\nof the house of Bourbon and pointing out that of the twelve provinces\r\nof the kingdom ten were in the hands of governors who were bound by\r\nblood or interest to the Bourbons.[1512] So eager were many of the\r\ngentry of France for war with Spain, either in Navarre or Flanders,\r\nthat one of Coligny’s officers, when asked whether France meant to lose\r\nthe favorable opportunity of attacking Spain, scornfully rejoined,\r\n“What can we do? We are good for nothing, for we have to deal with a\r\nscared King and a timid queen, who will not come to any decision.” By\r\nDecember, 1571, war with Spain was on every lip and the government\r\nbegan to collect money.[1513]\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, when all Europe was keyed to concert pitch of\r\npolitical tension, when anything seemed likely to happen and no one of\r\nthe great powers dared make an overt move, the Gordian knot was cut.\r\nOn April 1, 1572, the most notable event in the Low Countries since\r\nthe iconoclastic outburst occurred. For on that day the count van\r\nder Marck, commander of the Beggars of the Sea, captured the port of\r\nBrille. From that time onward the Dutch and Flemings had a maritime\r\npoint of their own on the mainland and were no longer dependent on the\r\nprecarious shelter of English and Norman ports. The effect of this blow\r\nto Spain was great. Within the week—on Easter Day—Flushing, and soon\r\nafterward Middelburg, rebelled against the billeting of Spanish troops\r\nsent by Alva to replace the Walloon garrison there.[1514]\r\n\r\nThe Gueux were masters of the sea and when Dordrecht also rebelled,\r\nthe inland water routes were endangered too. No vessel could come\r\nfrom Holland, Guelders, or Frisia and no communication could be made\r\nfrom the north with Brabant. Even Amsterdam could be starved and\r\nAlva determined to retire all his forces to Ghent and Antwerp.[1515]\r\nOn April 14 William of Orange issued a proclamation from Dillenburg\r\nexpressing his grief at the miseries suffered from the exactions,\r\noutrages, and cruelties inflicted by the Spaniards, and assured the\r\npeople of his determination to liberate the land from their tyranny.\r\nAs many towns and ports had already recognized him as their ruler, he\r\nurged others to follow their example, pledging his word to use all his\r\npower to restore the ancient privileges and liberties of each.[1516]\r\n\r\nWhen news of these wondrous deeds reached France, Charles IX’s\r\nhesitation was swept away by the combined fervor of Louis of Nassau\r\nand the admiral. On April 19, the Anglo-French treaty of alliance was\r\nsigned at Blois.[1517]\r\n\r\nDu Plessis-Mornay, a young Huguenot gentleman of twenty-three, of\r\nmarked literary ability and destined to be the intellectual leader\r\nof the Protestants in coming years, who had lately traveled through\r\nthe Netherlands and visited England,[1518] in collaboration with the\r\nadmiral drew up a remarkable memorial advocating French intervention in\r\nthe Low Countries,[1519] which Coligny presented to the King. English\r\nand French volunteers soon poured into the land.[1520] Louis of Nassau\r\nleft for Valenciennes, which had successfully revolted, accompanied\r\nby La Noue and Genlis.[1521] On May 24, by a stratagem, Genlis secured\r\npossession of Mons, one of the most important fortresses to Spain\r\nin the Low Countries in the present state of mind that France was\r\nin.[1522] From this point of vantage he wrote hopefully to Charles IX\r\nfor more soldiers, a “good minister,” a surgeon, some cannon founders,\r\nand drugs.[1523] While these events were happening on land, on the sea\r\nthe Zealanders attacked and dispersed the Spanish fleet in the Sluys on\r\nJune 8, and seized twenty merchantmen under its convoy:[1524] and, to\r\nthe elation of France,[1525] far down in the Bay of Biscay the fleet of\r\nFlushing three days later scattered another of Spain’s armadas.[1526]\r\nAll Holland, Amsterdam and Rotterdam excepted, was lost to Spain.[1527]\r\nSir Humphrey Gilbert with 1,200 English and some French and Walloons\r\nlanded in the Low Countries, on July 10, and captured Sluys and\r\nBruges.[1528] Money poured in upon William of Orange, who in June went\r\nto Frankfurt to purchase supplies and enlist men.[1529] The duke of\r\nAlva was in desperate straits. The Walloons everywhere in the army\r\nmutinied and deserted, and he was short of munitions.[1530]\r\n\r\nBut such successes were too great to last. Louis of Nassau found he\r\ncould not hope to hold Mons for long with the slender forces at his\r\ncommand and sent Genlis back to France for reinforcements. Charles\r\nIX, under pressure from Coligny, provided men and money secretly,\r\nbut Genlis’ relief column was intercepted on July 16 and captured by\r\nthe duke of Alva.[1531] It was only a question of time before Mons\r\nsurrendered.[1532] The blow was a heavy one to France. It mattered\r\nlittle to France that French subjects were killed or taken prisoner\r\nduring the siege. But it was of tremendous consequence to France that\r\nAlva found on Genlis’ person a letter written by Charles IX to Louis of\r\nNassau on April 27, 1572, in which the King said that he was resolved\r\nas soon as the condition of affairs at home permitted him, to employ\r\nthe armies of France for the liberation of the Low Countries.[1533]\r\nWell might Alva’s secretary write “I have in my possession a letter\r\nof the king of France which would strike you with astonishment if you\r\ncould see it.”[1534] Spain possessed indubitable proof at last of\r\nFrench duplicity.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Genlis and the knowledge that Spain had penetrated\r\nthe whole secret of her design, filled the French government with\r\nconsternation, though Charles IX affected a show of courage he did not\r\nfeel.[1535] That consternation became abject dismay when it was learned\r\nthat Elizabeth of England, partially out of reluctance to have war with\r\nSpain, more because of fear lest French foothold in the Low Countries\r\nwould jeopardize her commercial ascendency there, repudiated the treaty\r\nof alliance.[1536] As one reviews the months before the massacre one\r\nasks just how far Elizabeth herself may have been responsible for it.\r\nIt was she who, by her tortuous and insincere policy alarmed Charles IX\r\nand Catherine, causing the Flanders expedition to be abandoned; it was\r\nthis which caused Coligny to turn upon Catherine in the King’s council,\r\nsaying, “This war the King renounced. God grant he may not find himself\r\ninvolved in another less easy to renounce.” The line comes straight\r\nfrom Elizabeth surely, but can be emphasized too strongly. That some\r\nblame must rest on the English cannot be denied, however. Did Catherine\r\nde Medici plan the massacre of St. Bartholomew to save herself from the\r\nwrath of the Huguenots? Or, in her terror did she seek to appease the\r\nwrath of the Catholic dragon with human lives? Was the massacre of St.\r\nBartholomew the bloody price of Spain’s satisfaction?\r\n\r\nBut there is another element to be considered in any endeavor to\r\nunravel the causes of that event. All the art of Catherine de Medici\r\nfor years past had been expended in an endeavor to maintain control\r\nby balancing the parties against one another. At this minute she was\r\ninsanely jealous of the admiral Coligny, whose political ascendency\r\nseemed all the greater because of the conduct of the Protestants who\r\ncrowded Paris for the coming nuptials, enjoying their superficial\r\npopularity with too much arrogance in many cases, and angering the\r\nsentiment of the Parisians, the most Catholic populace in France.\r\n\r\nThe massacre seems primarily due to the jealousy and hatred felt by\r\nCatherine de Medici toward Coligny on account of his great ascendency\r\nover Charles IX, coupled with panic after the failure of her deliberate\r\nattempt to have him murdered, and fear of war with Spain—a fear all\r\nthe greater because of England’s desertion of France in Flanders\r\nat this critical moment, lest English commercial ascendency there\r\nshould suffer.[1537] It was a crime of fear, a horrible resource in\r\na difficult emergency; partly a craven attempt to placate Spain for\r\nwhat had been done against her; partly a crime of jealousy. Perhaps\r\njealousy of Coligny was even a stronger motive than fear of Spain.\r\nThe attempt upon Coligny’s life on August 22, would seem to indicate\r\nthis.[1538] Was the general slaughter of the Huguenots the consequence\r\nof the failure of this attempt? If the shot of August 22 had killed the\r\nadmiral, would the massacre have taken place? I think not. The failure\r\nto kill the admiral was the immediate occasion of the massacre of St.\r\nBartholomew’s Day. If Coligny had been killed then and there, the\r\nmassacre probably would not have happened.\r\n\r\nThe failure to compass the death of the admiral made Catherine frantic\r\nwith mingled rage and fear lest the Huguenots concentrated in Paris\r\nwould rise in reprisal. She took council with Guise, Anjou, Madame de\r\nNemours, and Gondi, the Italian bishop of Paris. The resolution of the\r\nKing, who at first believed that the duke of Guise was the author of\r\nthe attempted assassination, was beaten down by his mother, and when\r\nhis fierce instincts were at last aroused, the way was easy. The hatred\r\nof Paris could be relied upon to do its worst, under the guidance of\r\nthe provost who was taken into the plot.[1539]\r\n\r\nThere is no need to detail the history of this famous day. At\r\none-thirty on the morning of August 24 the tocsin sounded from the\r\ntower of St. Germain-l’Auxerrois. Coligny was the first victim. From\r\nthe Louvre the murderous spirit spread to the Ville, to the Cité,\r\nto the university quarter. Henry of Navarre and the prince of Condé\r\nsaved themselves by abjuration. Montgomery escaped on a fleet horse to\r\nthe south. Estimates of the dead are so different that any positive\r\nopinion is impossible. La Popelinière gives 1,000 for Paris, the Tuscan\r\nambassador 3,000, Davila 10,000. Brantôme says nearly 4,000 bodies were\r\nthrown into the Seine.\r\n\r\nFrom Paris the massacre spread to the provinces. On August 25 the fury\r\nreached Meaux and Troyes; on the 26th La Charité, on the 27th Orleans\r\nand Bourges, on the 28th Caen, on the 30th Lyons. Bordeaux and Toulouse\r\nfollowed. At Rouen, Carrouges, the governor, would not obey the\r\nKing’s warrant until doubly convinced, when he retired to his country\r\nhouse and refused to execute it, though he did not have the courage\r\nto prevent the massacre, as was the case at Dijon, Limoges, Blois,\r\nNantes.[1540]\r\n\r\nThere is no reason for doubting that the massacre of St. Bartholomew\r\nwas unpremeditated. It was not plotted years before, or even many days\r\nbefore. The light of modern investigation[1541] has proved this to\r\nthe satisfaction of every unprejudiced historian, whether Protestant\r\nor Catholic. The combination of causes that led to the action; the\r\nmotives of the principals; the responsibility for the massacre are\r\ntoday known with as much certainty as moral forces having relative\r\nand not absolute values can be. Even unprejudiced contemporaries, La\r\nNoue and Henry IV himself, did not believe the massacre to have been\r\npremeditated. A general slaughter of the Protestants was an old idea,\r\nbut never regarded as a practical one, save by the papacy. The guilt of\r\nthe massacre in all its monstrous proportions and consequences rests\r\nupon Catherine de Medici first of all. Fundamentally considered, it\r\nwas the crime of a tigerishly hateful and essentially cowardly woman’s\r\nheart. Catherine was the author and instigator of it. The Guises\r\nentered into the plot chiefly to avenge themselves upon the admiral and\r\nreally had little interest in prosecuting it beyond his death.[1542]\r\nThe duke of Anjou and Tavannes were the fanatics. Charles IX was the\r\ncreature of his mother’s malign influence and the victim of his own\r\nferocious temperament which he had long indulged, and to which he now\r\nallowed monstrous license. For the rest the massacre of St. Bartholomew\r\nwas perpetrated by men whose natures were compounded out of religious\r\nbigotry, political enmity, personal resentment or mere ruffianism and\r\nlove of violence. The massacre of St. Bartholomew could not possibly\r\nhave been of the remotest political benefit to any person. It was\r\nboth a crime and a blunder. But Catherine de Medici was a ruler whose\r\npolitical conduct was governed by her personal feelings and prejudices.\r\nIn the crisis in which she was, she had not the acumen to discern, or\r\nthe courage to dare to follow, the course that lay open before her if\r\nshe had had eyes to see and an understanding instead of a passionate\r\nheart. That course lay toward Italy and not toward the Netherlands.\r\nIf France had reasserted her claims to Naples and Milan, then in the\r\npossession of Philip II, the nation would have been united in a common\r\ncause that would have appealed to ancient pride and achievement as well\r\nas existing animosity against Spain. England would have had no reason\r\nto be jealous, for her hand would have been free in Flanders. Moreover,\r\nin Italy France might have looked for support from Tuscany and Ferrara.\r\nSwitzerland would have supported the enterprise; Venice would have\r\nmade no opposition and the Emperor, for all his Spanish attachments,\r\ncould not have done so. With the Turk in the Mediterranean on her side,\r\nFrance could have gone into war with Spain and the Pope without fear\r\nand with great promise of success.[1543]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH CIVIL WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe massacre of St. Bartholomew, like a bolt out of a clear sky,\r\nprecipitated a new storm—the fourth civil war. La Rochelle was the\r\nstorm center, though Sancerre and Montauban were rocks of safety for\r\nthe Huguenots of the center and south of France, no less than three\r\nthousand Protestants and Politiques of Toulouse finding refuge in the\r\nlatter place.[1544] When Charles IX’s murderous passion was overpast\r\nand reason returned, he attempted to avert a new war by offering\r\nfavorable terms to the Rochellois.[1545] But when the town fortified\r\nitself and refused to trust the “favorable” terms offered by Biron and\r\nturned toward England for aid, the marshal was commanded to take the\r\ncity by storm.[1546] The government was heavily embarrassed in its\r\nmilitary preparations. Money was scarce and the rate of interest 15\r\nper cent.[1547] Soldiers of judgment and experience pointed out that\r\nwithout either Swiss or Germans the King could not successfully batter\r\nthe town, “for Frenchmen were not fit for the keeping of artillery,\r\nor to make the body of the ‘battle’ of footmen,” and the Swiss diet\r\nrefused to let France draw more mercenaries from the Alpine lands. The\r\nKing was equally unsuccessful in his endeavor to recruit footmen in\r\nGermany.[1548]\r\n\r\nThe enigmatical policy of Elizabeth was also a deterrant in the\r\nbeginning of the war. While she sent the earl of Worcester into France\r\nin January, 1573, to treat of commerce and to dangle the prospect of\r\nher marrying Charles IX’s youngest brother, the duke of Alençon, before\r\nthe eyes of the French court,[1549] the English queen did not turn a\r\ndeaf ear to the petition of the Rochellois.[1550] If after the massacre\r\nthere was less fear of strengthening France by giving aid to the Low\r\nCountries, on the contrary it became doubly necessary for England not\r\nto break with Spain, so that the policy of Queen Elizabeth was a timid\r\nand hesitating one.\r\n\r\nWhen England’s policy was perceived to be so weak, the government\r\npushed forward its military preparations against the city and the\r\nItalian artillery commander, Strozzi, in mid-December, took Marans,\r\nnot far from La Rochelle, and put the garrison to the sword. But\r\nthe Rochellois maintained the ramparts against all onslaught. The\r\nattacking army, under command of the duke of Anjou, lay in the dike\r\nunder the curtain of the town walls, but could get no farther. To add\r\nto the discomfiture of the Catholics, the King’s army was in want\r\nof foodstuffs on account of the rising of the country roundabout,\r\nespecially Poitou and Limousin.[1551]\r\n\r\nThe dearth, however, was more than local. The winter of 1572-73 was\r\nagain a hard one, and though the spring of 1573 opened early and mild,\r\nthere came recurrence of cold; so much so that processions were held,\r\nimploring the grace of God upon the fields where much of the grain was\r\nkilled. The ensuing high prices of grain were made higher owing to\r\nthe fact that great amounts of it were stored by the dealers against\r\nthe market. There were bread riots and popular tumults in various\r\nlocalities and many towns fixed a maximum price. This condition of\r\nthings aggravated the state of war throughout the country. Multitudes\r\nof people crowded the towns. These refugees brought their possessions\r\nwith them, their linen and household goods, their sheep and their\r\ncattle, which they were forced to sell for a song in order to buy bread.\r\n\r\nThe hard times also led to the migration of people from province to\r\nprovince and increased the vagabondage that already existed. The hunger\r\nwas so great that men and women devoured vegetables, and even grain,\r\nraw. In consequence of the lack of food or the way in which it was\r\nconsumed, suffering and disease ensued. Those who were fortunate enough\r\nto possess a garden plot with a few vines or fruits or vegetables were\r\ncompelled to guard them by night and by day against the spoiler. It\r\nwas considered an act of charity for those who had fruit trees, after\r\nthemselves gathering the fruit, to permit those more wretched than\r\nthey to strip the branches of their leaves and consume them. Paris\r\nsuffered with the rest of France, for it was impossible to supply\r\nthe city with food from the Beauce and Picardy and Champagne. Grain\r\nwas imported from Spain and even from the Barbary coast, the timely\r\narrival of six vessels, on one occasion, saving the capital from the\r\npinch of famine.[1552] The “hard times,” which lasted more than a\r\nyear, naturally bore heaviest upon the poorer classes, whose wretched\r\ncondition contrasted with the luxury and vanity of the wealthier\r\nclasses, with whom extravagance reached an extreme.[1553]\r\n\r\nDuring the winter there was a complete cessation of hostilities before\r\nLa Rochelle. Not a cannon was discharged all through the months of\r\nDecember, January, and February.[1554] In derision of the King’s camp,\r\nsome of the more daring of the Huguenot soldiery strutted about adorned\r\nwith cards and dice to signify that the King’s troops were better\r\ngamesters than soldiers.[1555] The truth is, Protestant France was not\r\nall of one mind to continue the resistance. There were two parties\r\nin the Huguenot capital, the irreconcilables, who wanted war to the\r\nknife and favored looking to England for support; and a more moderate\r\nfaction led by that Bayard of the Protestants, the heroic La Noue,\r\nwho, believing that the great enemy of France and of the Huguenots was\r\nSpain,[1556] with proper guarantees stood ready to forget and forgive\r\nthe massacre, so far as it was possible for human memory and feeling\r\nto do so, recognizing that that event was a catastrophe to Catholic\r\nas well as to Protestant France; that, however monstrous it was as a\r\ncrime, as a blunder its effects were even more calamitous.\r\n\r\nAs for the crown, it was even more anxious than the moderate Huguenots\r\nto avoid a protracted siege and come to some form of settlement.[1557]\r\nWith this aim Charles IX, through the medium of the duke of\r\nLongueville, governor of Picardy, early in October had made overtures\r\nto La Noue, who was still in Flanders. After some hesitation La Noue\r\ncame to Paris where he had a conference with the King and the queen\r\nmother. So trusted and so capable was he that Charles IX gave him\r\npractically discretionary powers to bring about a settlement, and in\r\nthe middle of November La Noue went to La Rochelle.\r\n\r\nFor days the intrepid leader vainly endeavored to secure entrance into\r\nthe city.[1558] Finally, on November 26 he was reluctantly admitted.\r\nDuring the cold and weary weeks of December, January, and February,\r\nwhile besieged and besiegers were lying on their arms upon the walls\r\nor in the trenches, La Noue alternately entreated and expostulated,\r\nurging the necessity of peace in the face of vilification, the Huguenot\r\nminister La Place even calling him “perfide traistre, déserteur de\r\nson parti.” “The word of the King,” said Catherine de Medici, to the\r\ndeputies of the Reformed on one occasion, “ought to be sufficient for\r\nyou.” “No,” replied one of them, “not since St. Bartholomew.”[1559]\r\nEven La Noue’s influence could not overcome the radical party in La\r\nRochelle which imprisoned as many as advocated capitulation no matter\r\nwhat the terms might be. At last on March 12, 1573, the brave man gave\r\nup hope of persuading the zealot populace and returned to the King’s\r\ncamp. Angry at the failure of these pacific overtures, the government\r\nforces redoubled their attacks. On March 22 the royal artillery opened\r\na terrible fire upon the city, more than 1,500 cannon-balls being\r\nthrown. On April 7 there was a furious assault, even women fighting on\r\nthe wall, and the attack was repeated on the 10th, 13th, and 14th, on\r\nthe last day there being five separate attempts to take the city by\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nMontgomery, who had been sent to England for assistance,[1560] appeared\r\nwith about seventy ships, and was on the point of giving battle in\r\nthe bay, when a fleet of forty vessels from the ports of Brittany and\r\nNormandy hove in sight. These ships, with what Anjou could muster,\r\nmade too great a body for Montgomery to risk an engagement, and so he\r\nretired to Belle-Ile, which was made a Protestant naval base.[1561]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Plan de la\r\n  Rochelle en M·D·LXXII.\r\n\r\nFrom _Histoire au siège de La Rochelle en 1573_, traduite du Latin de\r\nPhilippe Cauriana (La Rochelle, 1856).]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Swiss in camp had toiled in the trenches and “swamp\r\nangel” guns were established in the marshes to batter the port of St.\r\nNicholas. On June 11 the supreme assault on La Rochelle was made and\r\nrepulsed. The attacking force by an escalade gained possession of\r\nthe rampart but found a mighty trench before them, so that they were\r\nconstrained to beat their way along the rampart in the hopes of finding\r\na place to cross it. Those in the camp, seeing their comrades gain the\r\nramparts, cried, “ville gaignée!” But the Rochellois lured the enemy\r\nalong the wall “and when they were entered set upon them both before\r\nand behind with such fury that they were all either slain or hurt, and\r\nthe rest who were coming to succor the foremost were repulsed with\r\ngreat loss.”[1562]\r\n\r\nAfter the failure of the great assault, because the soldiery without\r\nwas so much discouraged by failure, angry for lack of pay,[1563] and\r\nweakened by losses and disease, the only recourse of the crown was\r\nto capitulate with the Rochellois[1564] with as much reservation as\r\npossible. Villeroy’s report on the condition of things before La\r\nRochelle was too convincing to be ignored[1565]. In the first week\r\nof July, after two days’ deliberation, Charles IX signed the terms,\r\nalthough they were not published at once.[1566]\r\n\r\nThe general provisions were that those of La Rochelle should have life,\r\ngoods, and liberty of conscience and that the town, together with\r\nMontauban, Sancerre, and Nîmes should also have “free exercise of\r\nthe religion and find a garrison for themselves.” The edict declared\r\nthat the memory of all things which had happened since the 24th of\r\nAugust should be extinguished; that the Catholic religion was to be\r\nestablished throughout the country, except at the four cities named.\r\nBailiffs and judges ordinary were to see to the decent interment of\r\nthose who died in the Reformed religion. Those who gave security\r\nthat they would change their religion should be admitted to the\r\nuniversities, schools, hospitals, without hindrance, and finally that\r\nany French Protestant might sell or alienate his goods and retire to\r\nany country he pleased, provided it were not to the territory of any\r\nprinces where war obtained, a provision obviously intended to protect\r\nSpain in the Netherlands.[1567]\r\n\r\nBut the fourth war of religion was not yet entirely over. While La\r\nRochelle with 2,000 men daily labored to repair its battered walls,\r\nSancerre was not to be tempted by the terms, and the south of France\r\nstill held out. The heroic resistance of Sancerre, perched like an\r\neagle’s nest on a steep hill above the Loire, is one of the epic\r\nstories of the sixteenth century. For nearly eight months (January 3 to\r\nAugust 19, 1573) the city withstood every assault and only succumbed\r\nat last when reduced to direst famine. Horses, asses, dogs, cats, rats\r\nwere all consumed. Soup made of boiled parchment became a luxury. The\r\ninhabitants ate “pain de paille haschée et d’ordorze y meslant du\r\nfumier de chevaux et tout ce qu’ils pensoient avoir quelque suc.” Even\r\nthe bodies of the dead were disinterred and consumed. When human nature\r\ncould endure no more, Sancerre threw itself upon the mercy of its\r\nconqueror. It was granted liberty of worship and the people spared from\r\nmassacre and pillage for the price of forty thousand livres; but its\r\nmediaeval glory was shorn from it. The splendid clock-tower of the town\r\nwas destroyed, its ramparts razed.[1568]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the pacification at La Rochelle and the fall of Sancerre,\r\nthe Midi still resisted. In Languedoc and Dauphiné the Huguenots were\r\nespecially strong.[1569] Their harvests were garnered into walled\r\ntowns; their army included 2,000 arquebusiers besides the Huguenot\r\ngentry and they were well prepared for further war.[1570] On the\r\nanniversary of the massacre (August 24, 1573) deputies of all the\r\nchurches of the south convened at Montauban and took the preliminary\r\nsteps in the formation of the great Huguenot confederation which in\r\nDecember assumed the direction of the war, the regulation of finances,\r\ncivil administration, and religious protection.[1571]\r\n\r\nLanguedoc was divided into two governments with Montauban and Nîmes as\r\ncenters under the authority of the viscounts of Paulin and St. Romain,\r\neach assisted and controlled by a council. The councils, in turn, in\r\nall important matters were required to consult the local assemblies\r\nof Protestants. All these assemblies were elective. The Protestant\r\norganization thus constituted an all but full-fledged state within a\r\nstate, asserting its own power to lay taxes, to administer justice, to\r\ncarry on war, and to make peace. It was estimated that 20,000 men in\r\nthese regions were able to bear arms.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the continuance of the war in the south the Swiss\r\nand the rest of the soldiery not yet licensed were sent from the camp\r\nbefore La Rochelle into Dauphiné and Languedoc. But the government\r\nwas heavily embarrassed financially and had been compelled to resort\r\nto forced loans in Paris and the old shift of mortgaging the revenue\r\nuntil the grant of the clergy was made in June.[1572] Even then it did\r\nnot urge war. Charles IX, jealous of the Guises and of the military\r\nreputation which his brother had acquired, was again manifesting his\r\nhatred of the restraint imposed upon him, and desirous of recovering\r\nhis independence.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of France was to return to its earlier policy which\r\nhad been interrupted by the massacre.[1573] Charles again inclined\r\nto sustain Holland in its rebellion against Spain,[1574] at least\r\nunderhandedly. To strike Spain was at the same time to strike at all\r\nthe influences which he hated. Accordingly France made overtures anew\r\nto the prince of Orange, although it was not without repugnance that\r\nWilliam of Orange brought himself to listen to them.[1575] But the\r\nvoice of policy was stronger than sentiment.[1576] For on December\r\n11, 1572, the famous siege of Haarlem had begun. It was Alva’s purpose\r\nby the capture of this city to cut the communications between south\r\nHolland, where the prince of Orange was, and north Holland.[1577]\r\n\r\nFrom Germany the faithful and far-sighted Schomberg earnestly urged\r\nthe project and so artfully did he fulfil his mission that the elector\r\npalatine, the landgrave, and the archbishop of Cologne all espoused\r\nit.[1578] “The repose of the kingdom, the security of the state, the\r\nruin of the great enemy of France, direct and firm alliance with the\r\nprinces of Germany, the subversion of all the designs of the house\r\nof Austria, and the culmination of your desires, is in the hands of\r\nyour majesty,” he wrote to Catherine on March 23.[1579] At last,\r\nafter months of deliberation and delay, the threads of these tortuous\r\nnegotiations were all drawn together at a secret interview of Catherine\r\nde Medici with Louis of Nassau at Blamont in Lorraine, in December,\r\n1573.[1580]\r\n\r\nBut there was yet another reason why the crown of France was desirous\r\nof closing the conflict at home, which goes far to explain the\r\ngovernment’s willingness to compromise with La Rochelle. The throne\r\nof Poland had become vacant upon the death of Sigismund Augustus, the\r\nlast of the Jagiello house, on July 7, 1572. The crown of Poland was\r\nan elective one, the suffrage being in the hands of the diet, composed\r\nsolely of the two privileged orders. In the factional strife that too\r\noften ensued, the deadlock was sometimes broken by the election of an\r\noutside prince. This vicious and unnational policy triumphed in 1573.\r\nThe Emperor, the King of Spain, and France had each a candidate. But\r\nPoland had no mind to experience the fate of Bohemia and pass under\r\nthe suzerainty of the Hapsburgs. Spain, too, in the person of her\r\nambassador, was deprived of a hearing and compelled to make overtures\r\nin writing. In this wise the way was cleared for French diplomacy. In\r\nthe autumn of 1572, Charles IX had been sounded by the Poles as to the\r\ncandidacy of the duke of Anjou and had intimated the conditions to be\r\nexpected.[1581] On December 19, the secretary of the bishop of Valence,\r\nthe French agent who had been hastily dispatched to Poland, arrived\r\nin Paris, and gave great hope for the election of the duke of Anjou,\r\nthough the Polish diet had not met yet on account of the plague.[1582]\r\n\r\nWhen it convened on April 15, 1573, the dexterous feat was accomplished\r\nby the papal legate, Cardinal Commendone, who, for his spiritual\r\nmaster, was hostile to the Emperor for having lately made a three\r\nyears’ truce with the Turks and thus marred the glory of Lepanto, and\r\nopposed in principle to the widening of Spain’s activities anywhere,\r\nin view of the supreme struggle of the faith in France and the Low\r\nCountries, where the cause of Rome was in sore need of Spanish support.\r\nThe French envoys[1583] then skilfully introduced the name of the\r\nduke of Anjou, lauding his Catholic virtues in the ears of a Catholic\r\npopulace; promising that if elected Henry of Valois would spend all\r\nhis revenues—how little these were the Poles could not know—in\r\nPoland for the benefit of the kingdom; they promised, too, that the\r\nprospective king would recover from the Muscovite all the territories\r\nwhereof the kingdom of Poland had been despoiled in times past, as well\r\nas Wallachia from the Turks.[1584] The arguments told, and on May 19,\r\n1573, the duke of Anjou was elected king of Poland.\r\n\r\nOn August 8, 1573, the official deputation of Polish nobles sent to\r\nFrance to notify the duke of Anjou of his election reached Metz, and\r\nsoon afterward (June 24, St. John’s Day) arrived at Paris. They were\r\nthe advance guard of almost two thousand Polish nobles and gentry who\r\nvisited the kingdom during this summer. They were all magnificently\r\nlodged and entertained in the city at the expense of the crown, or\r\nrather at the expense of the people, for a new tax was imposed for\r\npurposes of entertainment. The appearance of the Poles struck the\r\nFrench with amazement. They were all tall, handsome men, “speaking\r\nLatin down to the very hostlers,” but marvelously given to drink and\r\ngreat gourmands. The wine-shops of the capital were almost drunk dry.\r\nTwo Poles, the saying went, drank more wine and consumed more meat than\r\nsix Frenchmen.[1585]\r\n\r\nThe honor of the crown of Poland salved the wounded pride of Anjou,\r\nstill before La Rochelle. But the army murmured so much that a royal\r\nmandate was issued making it a misdemeanor to argue or to discuss the\r\nPolish election in the streets of Paris, or to discountenance the\r\nelection of the duke of Anjou to the throne of Poland in written work\r\nor speech.[1586] Without victory, without pay, without even enough to\r\neat, the soldiers grumbled to the point of mutiny and averred that the\r\ngovernment was bribed, and took the Huguenot money in order to provide\r\nfunds for the King’s trip to Poland.[1587] Henry dared not openly\r\nleave the camp for fear of their rebellion and was compelled to make a\r\nfeint of going boating in the bay and then effect an escape by sea to\r\nNantes.[1588]\r\n\r\nDistance lent enchantment to the view. Poland was in a wretched\r\ncondition through the dissensions of the nobility. The Emperor was\r\nangry and talked of stopping the duke _en route_.[1589] Lithuania\r\nseceded and entered into an alliance with the duke of Prussia, the\r\nking of Sweden, and Russia, to overthrow the Polish government.[1590]\r\nThe Hanseatic cities, too, like Dantzig, Riga, and Revel, were very\r\ndissatisfied, for it was open knowledge that Poland aspired to the\r\ncontrol of their commerce.[1591] The Poles themselves soon discovered\r\nthat their new king was a goose without a golden egg. For the French\r\nlawyers found an interpretation of the promise that the French would\r\ndischarge the debts of the realm to the effect that the promise meant\r\nonly those arising since the death of the late king. The Polish\r\nagents in Paris made wry faces at the finding, but so the agreement\r\nwas registered by the Parlement of Paris on September 17, 1573.[1592]\r\nIn the same month the duke of Anjou set out for his new kingdom,\r\ngoing via Nancy, Heidelberg, and Frankfurt to Cracow. Metz he avoided\r\nbecause the Emperor, still sullen and still smarting from the loss of\r\nthe city twenty-one years before (1552), had commanded the imperial\r\ncommissioners appointed to conduct him, to receive him in Metz as\r\nthough it were a free city of the empire, which the French naturally\r\nrefused to permit.\r\n\r\nAgain the foolish affection of Catherine de Medici for one of her\r\nchildren,[1593] again her political fatuity, threw France far off\r\nfrom the course she should have followed. As before the massacre, so\r\nnow that course was the path to Italy.[1594] Instead of narrowing the\r\nfield of her ambition for her children and concentrating her power,\r\nnot content with Poland for the duke of Anjou, she even dreamed of the\r\nHapsburg crown for Charles IX,[1595] and that of England for Alençon.\r\nSchomberg’s missions in 1572-73 to Germany[1596] were not merely to\r\ndispose the German princes in favor of France’s projected enterprise\r\nin the Netherlands, but also to persuade them, especially the electors\r\nof Cologne and the Palatinate, in favor of the French King’s imperial\r\nambition. France’s policy in Poland[1597] and her policy in Germany\r\nwere two parts of one grand design and in a large sense had to stand\r\nor fall together. Peace with the Huguenots was an essential element in\r\nthe forwarding of this project, especially with the Protestant German\r\nprinces, as Schomberg pointed out.[1598]\r\n\r\nBut there were two great obstacles in the way of advance—German\r\nresentment because of the massacre of St. Bartholomew[1599] and\r\nthe counter-diplomacy of Spain.[1600] The Guisard-Spanish party at\r\nhome naturally exerted itself to thwart the prosecution of these\r\ndesigns.[1601] Morvilliers warned Charles IX that their continuance\r\nwould involve France in a war with Spain.[1602]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE LAST DAYS OF CHARLES IX. THE CONSPIRACY OF THE POLITIQUES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe war in the south, during the months of these negotiations, had\r\ngone on in its own course almost unhindered by the government. Many of\r\nthe men of service had gone with Anjou into Poland and many others,\r\nespecially the Swiss, were licensed. In consequence the Huguenots\r\nmade themselves masters of the Rhone, even seizing Avignon, to the\r\ngreat anger of the Pope, who refused to receive Paul de Foix as French\r\nambassador to Rome on the double ground that he was of the Huguenot\r\npersuasion and because the French King would not give safe-conduct\r\nto troops from Italy to go to Avignon for the purpose of recovering\r\nit.[1603] After the departure of his brother for Poland, Charles IX\r\nweakly took up the Protestant issue again, and he and his mother spent\r\nthree days at Chantilly with Montmorency in consideration of the course\r\nto follow.[1604] Deputations from various provinces came to the King to\r\npetition immediate reduction of the taxes on account of the exhausted\r\nstate of the country, but there was a unanimous wish against calling\r\nanother session of the estates on account of the expense.[1605] As an\r\nearnest of the King’s good intentions, the prince of Condé was made\r\ngovernor of Picardy, an office made vacant by the timely decease of the\r\nduke of Longueville, the prince, to the chagrin of the duke of Nevers\r\nwho was an aspirant for the post, having recovered from the smallpox,\r\nwith which the duke of Alençon also fell ill.[1606] The King had\r\nplanned to convene deputies of the Huguenots of Languedoc and Dauphiné\r\nat least at Compiègne, but fell ill of smallpox[1607] and the project\r\ncame to an end.[1608] To add to embarrassments Paris and Rouen, where\r\nthe populace were of the opposing religions, entered into war for the\r\nrestraint of foodstuffs, Paris stopping all wine passing down the\r\nSeine and Rouen in turn preventing corn from passing up the river to\r\nParis.[1609] The economic condition of the country gave the government\r\ngreat concern. Hard times and high prices still prevailed and the\r\nmeasures of the government only irritated things the more, though some\r\nof them were wisely meant. For example, in February, 1574, an edict of\r\nthe King forbade the circulation of all foreign silver coin, as well\r\nas that which was mutilated or debased. When the merchants of Troyes\r\nlearned of this condemnation of all foreign or cut coin, they sent a\r\ndeputation to remonstrate with the King, saying that their town and the\r\ncounty of Champagne as well as all Lorraine and Burgundy abounded with\r\nthis money and no other; and it was not possible to exclude these coins\r\nfrom the country without entailing ruin, if the edict were enforced.\r\nThey further urged that the edict would act as a serious bar to traffic\r\nacross the frontier. But the King refused to rescind the ordinance.\r\nIn consequence, those familiar with money palmed off the forbidden\r\ncurrency upon the simpler folk, who found to their dismay that they had\r\nbeen cheated, when the King’s officers refused to accept these coins in\r\npayment of taxes. Nevertheless, in the long run, the action raised the\r\nstandard of coin in France.[1610] Less wise action was the new sale of\r\noffices—those of the _procureurs du roi_—and it was even suggested\r\nthat the office of advocate be made a salable one, but fortunately for\r\nthe administration of justice, this was not done.[1611]\r\n\r\nPopular suspicion was also attached to an ordinance commanding the\r\ngovernors of the provinces, through the bailiffs and seneschals, to\r\ntake a census in their localities, giving the name, surname, and\r\nemployment of all men between the ages of twenty-one and sixty. It\r\nwas beyond the imagination of the people to know the reason of this\r\naction, or to divine what the King meant to do. Some thought that the\r\ncrown was going to establish a local constabulary for the arrest of the\r\nnumerous robbers and vagabonds, who, under the guise of war, looted\r\nand pillaged the country, and that men would be chosen in each parish\r\nlike the francs-archers of the days of Louis XII and Francis I. Others\r\nthought that the King merely wanted to raise a new army to send into\r\nLanguedoc where the Huguenots and the Politiques were now making common\r\ncause together. Others still thought that the device was one for taxing\r\npurposes.[1612]\r\n\r\nWorst of all, however, was an event that happened late in December,\r\n1573, which threatened to make the war general again. This event was\r\nthe discovery of a plot to overthrow the Protestants in La Rochelle.\r\nThe King seems to have been innocent of the project, and repudiated\r\nthe government’s part in it. The author of the plot was La Haye, the\r\npresident of Poitiers, who ingratiated himself with the people of\r\nthe town and managed to secure some of his accomplices positions in\r\nthe guard. The gate of the city was to be treacherously opened to a\r\nstrong force secretly brought up under cover of darkness on the night\r\nof December 15. But on the day before, one of the company betrayed\r\nthe plan to the authorities of the city.[1613] Tremendous indignation\r\nprevailed in Huguenot circles as a result of this disclosure. English\r\nmerchants in Rouen, Dieppe, and the Norman ports for a time apprehended\r\nlocal massacres, for Montgomery was known to be in England.[1614]\r\nIn the provinces, from day to day, news came of the doings of the\r\nHuguenots. La Noue was in Lusignan; there were Huguenot movements in\r\nPoitou, Limousin, and Guyenne;[1615] again it was word from Sedan, the\r\nseat of the duke of Bouillon, that there was a suspicious rendezvous\r\nof Huguenots there; another time that there were 500 Protestant horse\r\nand 1,200 footmen assembled at St. Lô.[1616] The government was under\r\napprehension lest suddenly, either at home some danger might assail\r\nFrance, or that abroad, by the actions of Germany and England, material\r\nassistance might be given to the Huguenots to carry their designs into\r\neffect, for the waters of the Channel and the Bay of Biscay swarmed\r\nwith privateers.[1617] On February 25 the Reformed party issued a\r\nfamous declaration “printed at Rochelle in diverse languages that\r\nthe truth of our cause and purpose may be known to all Christians.”\r\nFinally, news of real material importance came that Montgomery, whom\r\nGuitery had joined, had landed near Coutances and marched to Carentan,\r\nwhich surrendered within two days. Since then Montgomery had taken\r\nvarious forts and castles, among them Argentan, and ten pieces of\r\nartillery.[1618] Charles IX immediately commissioned the sieur de\r\nTorcy, lieutenant-general in the government of the Ile-de-France and\r\nthe viscount of Turenne to treat with him, making promise of favor and\r\nprotection if he would lay down his arms. But Montgomery replied that\r\nthe memory of St. Bartholomew was too fresh for him to do so; and for\r\nthat matter he would have to refer the King’s terms to the body of the\r\nReformed, of which he was only a member.[1619]\r\n\r\nThe Huguenots possessed a hierarchy of religious assemblies which\r\nserved to unite their forces, through consistories, colloquies, and\r\nprovincial synods, into a national body. Yet there was not an absolute\r\nuniformity in this organization. In the north of France each town\r\nmaintained its own particular administration, separate and distinct.\r\nLa Rochelle is a type of this kind and was fiercely jealous of its\r\n“franchises and liberties” after the manner of the German cities.[1620]\r\nIn the south, however, these local governments fused to form the\r\ngreat association, which rendered possible the creation of a genuine\r\nHuguenot political state. This development was materially aided by the\r\nPolitiques. For one of the results of the massacre of St. Bartholomew\r\nwas the crystallization of the liberal Catholic element represented\r\nby the marshal Montmorency and his brother, Damville, into a real\r\npolitical party. It was composed of a group of young nobles, ambitious\r\nand ill satisfied, with whom politics was of more importance than\r\nreligion, and who were hostile to the queen mother and to the Guises.\r\nAmong them were the duke of Alençon, who perhaps dreamed of succeeding\r\nhis brother, when Henry of Anjou was far away in Poland, for Charles\r\nIX’s days were evidently numbered; the young princes of Navarre and\r\nCondé, who had been driven to espouse Catholicism by terror, the\r\nviscount of Turenne and the whole house of Montmorency. Even in the\r\ncamp before La Rochelle this faction of the Politiques laid its plots,\r\nendeavoring to put the fleet under command of the duke of Alençon, and\r\nprobably upon the advice of the king of Navarre opened intercourse\r\nwith La Noue.[1621] La Noue was persuaded that much might be gained\r\nby the fusion of the Huguenots and the Politiques. The significance of\r\nthis development must not pass unnoticed. The whole character of the\r\nwar was ultimately changed by it. La Noue first, and later Damville,\r\nbecame the genius of this alliance. He negotiated with Damville, with\r\nAlençon, with Henry of Navarre. He sent Du Plessis-Mornay to England.\r\nBut his greatest feat of diplomacy was the persuasion of the people of\r\nLa Rochelle to adopt the new course. It required all the eloquence, all\r\nthe charm, and all the strategy of a born leader of men to convince the\r\nhot-headed and impetuous Rochellois, but he finally succeeded, and the\r\nalliance was at last concluded between the Huguenots of religion and\r\nthe Huguenots of state, the connecting link being the new party of the\r\nPolitiques.[1622]\r\n\r\nThe Protestants and the Politiques speedily converted theories into\r\npractice in the south of France, where their confederation spread over\r\nall Languedoc and much of Guyenne. Two towns in each province were\r\nappointed as “Confederate towns.” Special parlements pronounced upon\r\nall law cases which arose between litigants of either group. Liberty of\r\nworship was recognized as sacred right and this _de facto_ government\r\neven undertook the trial and condemnation of the authors of the\r\nmassacre of 1572.\r\n\r\nWe get clear intimations of these new political ideas in the literature\r\nof the time.\r\n\r\nIn the last days of Charles IX a political treatise appeared entitled\r\n_Du droit des magistrats sur les sujets_, purporting to have been\r\npublished in Magdeburg, which advanced the thesis that the kingship,\r\nalthough established by God, was a popular institution, and that, if\r\nthe king were unfaithful to his office, he could be set aside.[1623]\r\nThe _Franco-Gallia_ of Hotman proclaimed the sovereignty of the people\r\nand the dependency of the crown upon its will. The same idea dominates\r\nthe _Junius Brutus_ of Hubert Languet. Popular sanction, he says,\r\nalone makes the king; election is an inalienable right of the people to\r\nwhom the king is responsible. A pamphlet inspired by the Montmorencys\r\nand called _La France-Turquie_ compared Charles IX to the Sultan and\r\naccused him of endeavoring to reduce his subjects to eastern servility.\r\n\r\nAn incident that occurred at this time shows how far the idea of\r\nlimited monarchy obtained among the Huguenots. In the course of one\r\nof the negotiations the prince of Condé was asked to sign a paper for\r\nhis party. His reply was that he and the king of Navarre “had no other\r\nauthority in that party than that which they had received with the\r\narticles of their election,” which did not attribute a monarchical\r\npower to them, the party being composed of a great number of the\r\nnobility and the third estate, who had given power to them.[1624]\r\n\r\nYet there was not complete homogeneity in the new order of things. The\r\nPolitiques, except high nobles, and the rank and file of the Huguenots\r\nrepresented liberal democratic ideas. But the nobles could not forget\r\ntheir ancient lineage. The _assemblées de généralité_, created in\r\n1573, included the chief members of the nobility, and although the\r\nthird estate occupied an important place in them, the generals were\r\nall nobles.[1625] The nobility were not slow to resume their ancient\r\nsuperiority owing to the influence of the king of Navarre, who was not\r\nas pliable as the prince of Condé, particularly after the Huguenot\r\nalliance with the Politiques.[1626]\r\n\r\nAn enormous amount of provincial spirit had been aroused during the\r\ncourse of the wars. One of the speakers in the _Reveille-matin_ speaks\r\nof the half-independence of Dauphiné, and points out the strong\r\ntendency to re-establish the ancient provincial organization. This\r\ntheory of the Huguenots was in harmony with their constant assertion\r\nthat they were restorers of the past, not revolutionists. Feudal\r\ntraditions were too strong in France to be displaced by this new\r\nchange. While the bourgeoisie formed town groups, the Protestant\r\nand Politique nobles appealed to the provincial spirit. By a species\r\nof political atavism the régime of the Middle Ages began again to\r\nprevail.[1627] Every captain considered himself a petty sovereign.\r\nWhen the King ordered Montbrun to respect the majesty of the law, the\r\nhaughty rejoinder was that arms made men equal in the game of politics.\r\n“In time of war when one carries a weapon in his hand and sits in the\r\nsaddle, the whole world is comrade.”\r\n\r\nThe government accordingly made renewed endeavors to carry on the war.\r\nThe provost of Paris was authorized on March 30 to make proclamation\r\nthat all vassals and others in Paris belonging to the ban and\r\narrière-ban, should assemble, fully equipped on April 15; all gendarmes\r\nwere ordered to repair to the governors and lieutenant-governors of\r\ntheir several provinces, by April 20.[1628] Montpensier was sent into\r\nAnjou with instructions to do nothing against La Noue, but to keep the\r\npassages of the Loire and prevent him from joining with Montgomery. The\r\nhope was yet to arrange terms with the Huguenots and for that reason\r\nStrozzi, for whom La Noue had been exchanged after Moncontour, and\r\nPinart were sent to La Noue, bearing credentials from Henry of Navarre,\r\nand Villeroy dispatched to Languedoc. Simultaneously emissaries were\r\nalso sent to Sedan, for fear lest the prince of Condé and the duke\r\nof Bouillon might conspire with Louis of Nassau. East, west, south,\r\nthe clouds of war hung over France.[1629] In the court intrigue and\r\naccusation were rife all this time. In February the duke of Guise\r\nfeigned, or believed, that he discovered a plot to assassinate him, of\r\nwhich Montmorency was the author.[1630]\r\n\r\nThe absence of Henry of Anjou at this critical stage filled Catherine\r\nwith alarm, and strenuous efforts were made to bring about a\r\nsettlement. A secret agent of the queen mother named Pierre Brisson at\r\nthis time tried to bribe La Noue by the offer of 10,000 _écus de rente_\r\nto retire to England. It must have been a great temptation, for already\r\nthe intrepid leader was ruined by the war; but his nature was too noble\r\nto accept the terms. Charles IX for a season shook himself out of the\r\napathy of mortal illness, while the Huguenots and the Politiques bent\r\nevery endeavor to perfect their plans during the absence of the heir to\r\nthe throne in Poland. The scheme was to declare Henry of Anjou deprived\r\nof his rights to the crown and to recognize the duke of Alençon as\r\nheir-presumptive with the title of lieutenant-general of the kingdom.\r\nElizabeth of England[1631] and William of Orange were counted upon for\r\ninfluence and assistance. With this purpose a conspiracy was set on\r\nfoot much like that attempted at Meaux in 1567. The duke of Alençon and\r\nthe king of Navarre were to make their escape from court and effect a\r\nunion with Guitery, chief of the confederates in Normandy. They were\r\nthen suddenly to seize St. Germain and carry off the King and queen\r\nmother. The plot was that the king of Navarre, the duke of Alençon, and\r\nsome of their gentlemen should go forth from the court on the morning\r\nof this day as if to hunt, and ride toward Mantes, which was a town in\r\nthe appanage of the duke, and garrisoned by a company of the marshal\r\nMontmorency under the command of a brother of Du Plessis-Mornay. The\r\ngate was to be opened upon their appearance.[1632] March 1, 1574,\r\nwas the day set for the enterprise, but there was a misunderstanding\r\nbetween the leaders, and unfortunately, as in 1560, there were too many\r\ninformed of it. Catherine had vague information, and was on her guard.\r\nBut final failure was due to a false move of Guitery, who arrived upon\r\nthe scene a day ahead of the appointed time, and with insufficient\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nSuccess depended upon Guitery’s arriving at the hour of six on the\r\nmorning of March 1 with 300 gentlemen and some footmen, but on February\r\n27 the wild rumor was spread that there were some 700 or 800 horsemen\r\nof the religion seen within three leagues of St. Germain. Everybody\r\nmade ready for flight “removing of stuff as if they had fled before an\r\nenemy.” In the morning the march was made in battle array to Paris,\r\nCharles being so weak that he could scarcely ride his mule.[1633]\r\n\r\nAt Paris, fearful of going to the Louvre, the King lodged in the\r\nhouse of De Retz in the Faubourg St. Honoré and then went to Bois\r\nde Vincennes. Failing in his purpose Guitery sought to cross the\r\nSeine at Mantes, probably with the intention of joining La Noue who,\r\nhaving taken Lusignan and other towns in Poitou, as unsuccessfully\r\nwas endeavoring to cross the Loire to join Guitery.[1634] When the\r\nfirst alarm was over, the King and queen mother tried to make light\r\nof the episode. But it was a symptom the lesson of which could not be\r\nmistaken. It is plain that Charles IX and his mother feared greatly\r\nwhat Alençon might be planning, but he affirmed vigorously that he was\r\nonly trying to escape from court.[1635] When questioned, he disclaimed\r\nany treasonable intent or purpose to disturb the kingdom, but admitted\r\nhis hatred for the court party and his sympathy for the Politiques. In\r\na long harangue the duke accused the King of undue favoritism of his\r\nbrother, the duke of Anjou. The ground of his reproaches seems to have\r\nbeen pique because of the fact that, while in camp before La Rochelle,\r\naffairs of importance were never discussed in his presence.\r\n\r\n After the departure of the king of Poland, when he hoped to have more\r\n insight into public affairs, he had not been admitted, nor was he able\r\n to obtain the dignity and functions which had belonged to his brother.\r\n And these facts had lowered his reputation in the court to such an\r\n extent that the Guises not only desired to quarrel with him but were\r\n continually laboring to effect that result.[1636]\r\n\r\nFurther, Alençon complained\r\n\r\n that the king and his mother threw difficulties in the way of his\r\n intentions in Flanders; and made use of such well-reasoned arguments\r\n that it was clear the case that he put forward had been prepared by\r\n persons possessing greater experience and knowledge than his capacity\r\n could pretend to have. But he did not reveal any names. He alleged\r\n that he would have to remain a poor prince unless by force of arms\r\n he could acquire a position whereby he might obtain a sufficient\r\n reputation to accomplish a marriage with the queen of England; that in\r\n France the authorities and powers enjoyed by his brother, the King of\r\n Poland, were not given him, and that what little power he had was only\r\n in name, while, on the other hand, the prince of Orange has sought his\r\n aid by very large offers and many great promises had also been made to\r\n him from Germany and England, and that in the kingdom of France many\r\n persons had pledged their word to follow his fortunes everywhere.[1637]\r\n\r\nThe Guisard faction and Biragues, the chancellor, in order to strike\r\nMontmorency, who with Damville was the leader of the Politiques, urged\r\na drastic course. At the meeting of the King’s council, the chancellor\r\nsaid to the King:\r\n\r\n You should take into account the continual fear for your own person,\r\n and the imminent ruin which threatens the whole kingdom given you by\r\n God, the governor; and these considerations without doubt should move\r\n your majesty to follow the example of King Louis XI, your ancestor,\r\n who was so renowned in history, and to cause the world to know that\r\n while your Majesty is full of clemency, so you can also punish when\r\n the occasion demands.[1638]\r\n\r\nIn view of the high estate of those involved, Catherine de Medici,\r\nhowever, refused to follow out this resolute policy. But both princes\r\nand Montmorency were kept under surveillance though nominally allowed\r\ntheir liberty. This Scotch verdict of “not proven” was a great\r\ndisappointment to the Guises who probably are responsible for the\r\n“conspiracy” trumped up two weeks later. It was alleged that a plot had\r\nbeen “discovered” against the King and the queen mother which was to\r\nhave been carried into effect on Easter Day. On April 8, Alençon, Henry\r\nof Navarre, and the marshal Montmorency, were together in the castle of\r\nBois de Vincennes when suddenly the gates were shut and double guards\r\nset, for there was a rumor of the appearance of strange horsemen in\r\nthe vicinity. At the same time the gates of Paris were closed and no\r\none was permitted to pass out with any horse or weapon. La Mole, one\r\nof the gentlemen attached to Alençon, was suddenly arrested, and with\r\nhim another gentleman of Alençon’s entourage, the count Coconnas.\r\nBoth were imprisoned in the Conciergerie, and refused converse with\r\nthe duke. The prince of Navarre, Alençon, and Montmorency, however,\r\nstill were suffered to go abroad but “with such company as might be\r\nmasters.”[1639] Things now rapidly passed from farce to tragedy.\r\nAlençon and Navarre would confess nothing,[1640] the latter showing\r\n“a very bold face without any fear of consequences.” The examination\r\nwas with the purpose of acquiring colorable information from the\r\ninquisition of La Mole and Coconnas in order to implicate the duke\r\nof Montmorency. The poor wretches had nothing of the divinity that\r\nhedged the princes of the blood and were inquisitorially examined and\r\njudicially murdered.[1641] The duke of Alençon in vain entreated for\r\nthe lives of his friends. Charles IX, who was morbid and savage and\r\nstricken unto death[1642] would only allow that, instead of being\r\nexecuted in public, they should be put to death in prison.[1643] On\r\nApril 30 La Mole and Coconnas were beheaded and quartered.[1644]\r\n\r\nBut for once the ascendency of the queen mother over the King was of\r\ngood effect. Charles IX was urged to mete out the same penalty to his\r\nbrother, the marshals Cossé and Montmorency, and Henry of Navarre.\r\nIf it had not been for powerful intervention this might have been\r\nthe case.[1645] Imagine the astonishment of the world that expressed\r\nsurprise when Philip II imprisoned his son if such an act had been\r\ndone! In the ferocious mood now become habitual with the King, such a\r\nthing is conceivably possible. But Catherine de Medici spared Henry\r\nof Navarre now, as in the massacre of St. Bartholomew, because the\r\nBourbons were needful as a checkmate to the Guises. Such conduct, too,\r\nmight have driven England and the German Protestant princes into active\r\nsupport of the Huguenots—a consideration which had made Catherine\r\nhesitate before August 24, 1572. A living dog was better than a dead\r\nlion.[1646] “The King told that he should bear in mind that while the\r\nduke and Navarre were alive, he could do what he pleased, but if they\r\nwere dead there would be no remedy.”[1647]\r\n\r\nThe real motive and animus of the whole cruel affair—the destruction\r\nof the Montmorencys by the Guises—was not long in forthcoming.\r\nHitherto the duke had been allowed guarded freedom, even to go hunting.\r\nBut within a few days after the death of La Mole and Coconnas came\r\nword of the capture of Damville, Montmorency’s brother, in Languedoc.\r\nImmediately the duke of Montmorency and the marshal Cossé were shut up\r\nin the Bastille. The ancient and bitter grudge of the Guises against\r\nthe Montmorency-Châtillon house, half of which had been paid in the\r\nmurder of the admiral, narrowly missed being sated at this hour. In\r\nthe blood-thirsty mood in which the King was, the purple of kingship\r\nprobably would not have protected the duke. But at heart Charles IX\r\nand his mother were craven cowards, and the latter, at least, was not\r\nwholly lost to prudence. Fortunately for the duke of Montmorency and\r\nfor France, the word of Damville’s capture was a false report. He\r\nhad intercepted the instructions sent to Joyeuse and the governor of\r\nNarbonne for his apprehension and taken his precautions. Damville was\r\ntoo great a lion to rouse the anger of, while he was at large, and\r\nnothing but treachery could overthrow him, for he was in possession\r\nof Beziers, Montpellier, Pasenas, Beaucaire, Boignelles, and Pont St.\r\nEsprit, and as leader of the united Politiques and Huguenots of the\r\nsouth, in control of Languedoc, Dauphiné, and Provence.[1648]\r\n\r\nThe great political anxiety he labored under aggravated the condition\r\nof Charles IX, whose constitution, undermined by smallpox and his\r\nindulgences, had now been attacked by consumption. He was reduced to\r\nskin and bone and so weak that he could not stand and suffered from\r\neffusion of blood through the mouth.[1649] But the ferocity of his\r\nnature remained unsubdued. The faculty of medicine, the members of\r\nwhich were called in consultation, pronounced the King’s condition\r\nhopeless. “I believe you speak truly,” was Charles’ comment on the\r\nverdict. “Draw the curtain down that I may have some rest.”[1650] On\r\nthe night of May 29 a violent hemorrhage foretold the end. The King\r\ndied on May 30, 1574, at two hours after noon.[1651]\r\n\r\nThe queen mother at once assumed the regency[1652] in compliance with\r\none of the last commands of Charles IX, and removed from the Bois de\r\nVincennes to the Louvre, where Alençon and Navarre were kept under\r\nclose scrutiny, for until the return of Henry from Poland there was\r\ngreat uncertainty as to what might happen. The two were without money\r\nto corrupt the guards if so dangerous an expedient were hazarded; the\r\nwindows of their chamber “grated like a prison.”[1653] Catherine’s\r\npolicy was to promise redress of grievances and reconciliation of\r\nall at the coming of Henry III, who learned of his brother’s death\r\nat Cracow on June 15.[1654] To that end she appealed to La Noue and\r\nDamville but the Iron Arm flouted her overtures from his strongholds\r\nof Lusignan and Niort, condemning the queen for her treatment of\r\nMontmorency,[1655] and the imprisonment of Alençon and Henry of\r\nNavarre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LETTER OF HENRY III OF FRANCE TO THE DUKE OF SAVOY\r\n\r\nRelates to the pay of his troops.

He had suddenly left Carentan with about 650 horse,\r\nattacked the city of Alençon and then attempted to raise the siege of\r\nSt. Lô. But Matignon had more forces than he had supposed and drove him\r\ninto Domfront. After a vigorous defense he yielded the place upon the\r\npromise that his life would be spared. But Catherine de Medici hated\r\nhim above all men in the earth and had no scruples about inaugurating\r\nthe reign of Henry III with bloodshed. She refused to honor Matignon’s\r\npledge.[1656] Montgomery was brought under heavy guard to Paris, being\r\nviewed by curious gazers all along the road, and was beheaded and then\r\nquartered on June 26, before an enormous crowd of people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nHENRY III AND THE POLITIQUES. THE PEACE OF MONSIEUR (1576)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe attention of Europe was fixed upon France by these events. What\r\nwas going to happen in the absence of the heir to the throne? Would\r\na frightful wave of retaliatory vengeance for the massacre of St.\r\nBartholomew and the process of Vincennes sweep over the land? These\r\nwere the questions that were asked, not only everywhere in France,\r\nbut in many quarters of Europe. The Tuscan ambassador wrote that the\r\nchâteaux of the Montmorencys were filled with provisions and munitions\r\nof war.[1657]\r\n\r\nThe Politiques, as a class, being imbued with Hotman’s teachings\r\nin the _Franco-Gallia_, inveighed against Catherine for having\r\nassumed the regency without consent of the estates. They and the\r\npolitical Huguenots were at one, and demanded searching reform.\r\nIt was their hope to prevail upon the queen mother to come to a\r\ndefinite agreement before the arrival of Henry III in France, in the\r\nexpectation that the King upon his arrival would find it expedient\r\nto accept it. They demanded the reorganization of justice and the\r\narmy; they condemned the alienation of the crown lands, increase of\r\nthe tithe, and the new taxes; they insisted upon an examination of\r\nthe accounts of those who had managed the public finances and the\r\nroyal revenue, this investigation to include not only the ministers\r\nwho had enriched themselves, but also the superintendents of finance\r\nfrom Henry II down to the present time, not excepting the cardinal\r\nof Lorraine. They demanded the expulsion of the “foreigners,” naming\r\nthe chancellor Biragues, the marshal de Retz, and the duke of Nevers\r\nwho were all Italians. They hated the Guises as a foreign house and\r\nquasi-German.[1658]\r\n\r\nIt was high time for some sort of settlement. The country was crying\r\nout against the thieves and brigands, who frequented the roads in great\r\nnumbers under the guise of war and pretended to be in the service of\r\nthe King.[1659]\r\n\r\nBut Catherine refused to deal with any matter of state until the\r\narrival of the King. She showed an almost feverish anxiety for her\r\nson’s coming, fearing that the duke of Alençon would be put forward\r\nfor the crown by the Politiques.[1660] In Germany, at the same time,\r\nthe Orange party, with the aid of Schomberg, labored to promote the\r\ncause of the Politiques and liberal Huguenots, and in September a\r\ndeputation came from the count palatine to urge the cause of toleration\r\nin France.[1661] But it was slow and hard work, for as La Noue had\r\nbitterly said the year before: “The iron of the German nation was heavy\r\nand hard to work; it was silver that made things move.”[1662] Moreover,\r\nthe agents of Spain and the Guises were encountered at every turn.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Henry III had left Cracow on June 16, running away\r\nfrom his kingdom like a thief in the night,[1663] and came home by\r\nway of Italy, via Venice, where he was extravagantly entertained by\r\nthe senate,[1664] Ferrara (July 29), Mirandola, Mantua, and Turin,\r\nwhich he left on August 28, and arrived at Lyons on September 6.[1665]\r\nCatherine, who showed great impatience, met him there (she arrived\r\nat Lyons on August 27). So fearful was she lest Alençon and Henry of\r\nNavarre would escape that the young princes had traveled in the coach\r\nwith her.[1666] The procession moved as if through a hostile country by\r\nway of Burgundy and Chalons-sur-Saône, some of the guard marching in\r\nadvance, the rest bringing up the rear. “Marshal de Retz was always on\r\nthe wing of her. Some of the guard marched two leagues before and some\r\ntwo leagues after.”[1667]\r\n\r\nThose who were at all optimistic had clung to the belief, until the\r\ndevelopment of events shattered their hopes, that Henry III would\r\nendeavor to pacify his subjects, arguing that if he were inclined to\r\nwar, he would not have refused the assistance proffered him in Italy of\r\nmen and money, and that the French crown could not further hazard the\r\nreduction of the kingdom piecemeal.[1668] Damville had met the King at\r\nTurin, having come there under a safe-conduct of the duke of Savoy, to\r\npersuade Henry III to adopt a conciliatory policy, which he at first\r\ninclined to follow.\r\n\r\nBut the moment he came under the sinister influence of Catherine de\r\nMedici, he cast this prudent advice to the winds. It was she who\r\ndissuaded him from what was wisely counseled[1669] and in advance\r\nof his arrival had made military preparations to resume the war\r\nby importing Swiss mercenaries and German reiters again.[1670]\r\nAccordingly, instead of extending the olive branch, the King expressed\r\nhis determination to wage unremitting war upon the Huguenots and\r\nPolitiques rather than grant the demands they made. The deputies of\r\nLa Rochelle who came to Lyons, requesting a surcease of arms, were\r\nrepulsed by the King and told it was but a scheme of the Huguenots\r\nto gain time for preparation. The establishment of three camps was\r\nordered, one in Dauphiné, the second in Provence and Languedoc, and the\r\nthird in Poitou. At the same time Schomberg and Fregoso were sent into\r\nGermany for assistance.[1671]\r\n\r\nWhen Henry III definitely resolved to follow out a policy of\r\nsuppression Damville was summoned to Lyons to answer for his\r\ngovernorship. It was a fatal blunder on the part of the King, for\r\nthe action of the crown hardened the tentative co-operation of the\r\nProtestants and the Politiques into a positive alliance. At Milhau,\r\nin August, 1574 the Protestants recognized Damville, while he in\r\nturn admitted their leaders into his council. The form of government\r\nestablished at Montauban the year before acquired new strength and\r\ngreater extent. Provincial and general assemblies were formed without\r\ndistinction between Protestants and Politiques, upon the basis of\r\nmutual toleration; in places where the two creeds obtained each side\r\npromised to observe the peace and Damville engaged not to introduce the\r\nCatholic religion in any town of which the Huguenots were masters.\r\n\r\nThe men who took this step justified it by alleging that a foreign\r\nfaction had acquired control over the sovereign; that it was destroying\r\nthe kingdom, the nobles, the princes of the blood, and with them the\r\nvery institutions and civilization of France; and that it was their\r\nhope to arrest this process. The programme of the Huguenot-Politique\r\nparty, in addition to complete religious toleration, insisted upon the\r\nabolition of the practice of selling offices, the convocation of the\r\nStates-General, the reduction of the taxes. In this demand they were\r\nsupported by the provincial states of Dauphiné, Provence, and Burgundy.\r\nThe confessional idea was deliberately kept in the background. Men no\r\nlonger talked of a war of religion, but of a “Guerre du Bien Public” as\r\nin the reign of Louis XI.\r\n\r\nWith the nobles Damville’s was a name to conjure with. A large portion\r\nof the Catholic nobility, who for a long time had been severely\r\nreproached for not seriously opposing the Huguenots, sympathized\r\nwith his attitude. If the bench and bar of France was strongly\r\nattached to the principles of the Catholic religion, the nobility\r\nwho were hereditary enemies of the legists, whose teachings had for\r\nthree centuries tended to abridge their feudal rights, out of sheer\r\nself-interest, aside from any other motives, now inclined toward the\r\nCalvinists. Only radical Calvinists, like Du Plessis-Mornay, opposed\r\nthe union and were bitter in denunciation of the overtures made by\r\ntheir more moderate brethren, notably La Noue, to Damville and the\r\nPolitiques.[1672]\r\n\r\nA royal edict let the Huguenots understand what was to be expected. The\r\nKing’s determination was to clear the valley of the Rhone from Lyons\r\nto Avignon with the aid of the Swiss and then to subdue Languedoc on\r\nthe one side and Dauphiné on the other. Such a plan was more bold than\r\npracticable, and Henry was likely to find it too hard to accomplish,\r\nespecially by winter sieges. The Protestants had fortified themselves\r\nin Livron on the left bank of the Rhone and at Pouzin across the river,\r\nwhich was inaccessible except by one approach and then only four men\r\ncould advance abreast.\r\n\r\nBut there was another matter, the difficulty of which Henry III\r\nunderestimated, namely the army. The Protestants were so entrenched\r\nin their strongholds as to make the use of horsemen against them\r\nimpracticable. The Swiss were low-class mercenaries, good as ordinary\r\nfootmen but useless for a siege. Moreover, all of them, reiters and\r\nSwiss, were not disposed to move unless they saw their pay in their\r\nhands and were utter strangers to discipline, wasting the country “to\r\nmake a Christian man’s heart bleed.”[1673] In one case the wretched\r\npeasantry followed their despoilers to the confines of Lyons and fell\r\nupon them in desperation, recovering what had been taken from them.\r\nWhat did the King do? He actually had to punish these wretched subjects\r\nof his in order to retain the services of the reiters at all!\r\n\r\nYet the King for a moment showed some of the old fire he displayed at\r\nMoncontour and amazed the Protestants by taking Pouzin after three\r\nweeks of siege. The victory was marred, though, by the shameful conduct\r\nof the Swiss, the reiters, and the Italians in the royal army, who\r\nsacked and burned it. Much the same state of things prevailed wherever\r\nthese riotous plunderers penetrated—in Picardy, in Champagne, in\r\nPoitou. But Henry III having reached Avignon, discovered that he was\r\nno better off for his success. Meanwhile Damville, with whom the duke\r\nof Savoy had honorably dealt, returned from Turin, and reached the\r\nvicinity of Montpellier and Beaucaire before the King was aware of\r\nit.[1674]\r\n\r\nWhen the King sent the cardinal of Bourbon to talk with him, Damville\r\nsent back word that he thought the example of his brother “too\r\ndangerous to come to court where they who sought the ruin of his\r\nhouse had too much credit,”[1675] and advised the King to remove\r\nthe strangers within his gates, meaning Biragues and De Retz.[1676]\r\nHenry III could accomplish nothing at Avignon and yet knew not how\r\nto get away. He could not go up-river on account of the current. The\r\nHuguenots at Livron barred the road on the left bank; Montbrun was\r\nin the hills in Auvergne; La Noue’s men were stopping the King’s\r\npost daily and Damville controlled Provence and Languedoc; La Haye,\r\nKing’s lieutenant in the _séné-chaussée_ of Poitou seceded to the\r\nPolitiques.[1677] Vivarais declared its neutrality and refused to side\r\nwith King or Politiques. The people of Tulle refused to pay taxes\r\neither to Catholics or Protestants until overpowered by the latter,\r\nand thus the country continued to endure a war which it hated. Henry\r\ntruly was in a plight. He was without money, too, and could not hope to\r\nget any so far from Paris. He even feared that the soldiery with him\r\nmight be bribed to desert.[1678] To crown the royal anxiety Damville’s\r\ndeclaration was so public and so bold that the King feared that foreign\r\naid would soon be forthcoming in the Protestant service. The fear\r\nwas not without ground. For the marshal actually proposed to make a\r\nleague with the Sultan and introduce a Turkish fleet into the harbor\r\nof Aigues-Mortes.[1679] Coupled with this possibility was a projected\r\nenterprise against Spain in Franche-Comté in which the Huguenots of\r\nChampagne and Burgundy were interested, but which was primarily the\r\nproject of the elector palatine and the prince of Orange.[1680]\r\n\r\nIt is a significant fact that the war has now lost almost all\r\nconfessional character and become a factional conflict between the\r\nrival houses of Guise and Montmorency. Catholicism and political\r\ncorruption on the one hand were opposed to administrative reform and\r\nreligious toleration. After the creation of the Politique party, the\r\nHuguenots of state had merged with them. Except in the case of radical\r\nCalvinists and bigoted Catholics, religion had become a minor issue\r\nwith the French unless it were artificially exaggerated.[1681] It was\r\na mortal enmity on either side, and one which there was slight hope of\r\nsettling. The hostility of the Guises and the Montmorencys was the real\r\nseed of the civil war.[1682] It depended upon the individual in almost\r\nevery case whether his participation one way or the other was motived\r\nby convictions as to the public good or by private interests. The\r\nnumber of those who directly or indirectly were attached to the warring\r\nhouses almost divided the realm between them and the wretched people\r\nwere badly treated by both parties.[1683] So widespread and deep rooted\r\nwas this mutual enmity throughout France, that the Venetian ambassador,\r\nno mean observer, wondered when it would end, because it was to the\r\ninterest of each to sustain it. The King was a shuttlecock in this\r\ngame of political battledore. The ruin of the crown, instead of being\r\nfeared by them, was regarded as a possible way to give their enmity\r\nfreer rein. Each party counted not only upon paying its debts, which\r\nwere enormous, by victory, but in establishing the power of its house\r\nmore permanently than ever for the future. While the war cost the King\r\nand the country _écus par milliers_, it cost them nothing, at least of\r\ntheir own. The weakness of the crown was the strength of the rivals.\r\nThey fattened on war, for peace deprived them of their authority, their\r\npower, and their partisans. Until one or the other faction was crushed,\r\nthe hostility was certain to endure, and thus the war seemed doomed to\r\nlast indefinitely. If, as the result of fatigue or a truce, a respite\r\nwas made, the time was brief, and was terminated as soon as one or the\r\nother side had accumulated some substance again. The only remedy for\r\nsuch a state of affairs was to be found in a foreign war, either in\r\nFlanders or Italy.[1684]\r\n\r\nThe union of the Huguenots and the Politiques made them very strong,\r\nespecially in the south. But on the other hand the duke of Guise\r\nreceived much assistance from Flanders. When the successor of Alva,\r\nRequesens, learned of the death of Charles IX, he had offered the aid\r\nof Spanish troops to Catherine de Medici.[1685] Although the proffer\r\nwas declined, the practical result was the same, for owing to lack of\r\npay in the Low Countries, thousands of reiters and Walloon and German\r\nfootmen flocked across the border in the summer and autumn, where they\r\nwere welcomed by the duke of Guise, who, somewhere and somehow, found\r\nthe means to pay them.[1686] But below the stratum of professional\r\nsoldiers in France there was another class in arms which feudal society\r\nwas not used to see in such a capacity. This was the people; not town\r\nmilitia, for town and provincial leagues had made men familiar with\r\nthem, but the peasantry. The protracted wars by economically ruining\r\nand morally debauching this class had generated a breed of men who\r\nsprang from the soil like the dragon’s teeth of Greek fable, men who\r\nby observation and practice were used to the matchlock and the sword,\r\nbrutalized by oppression, long made desperate by burdensome taxes and\r\nthe wrongs of war.[1687]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIKEMAN AND COLOR-BEARER\r\n\r\n(Tortorel and Perissin)]\r\n\r\nThe weariness of vigil in the depth of winter and overconfidence seem\r\nto have relaxed the alertness of Henry III’s foes. At any rate, having\r\nextorted 50,000 francs from the noblemen and gentlemen in his train\r\nin order to pay the soldiery around him, the King, raising the siege\r\nof Livron on January 24, 1575, managed to slip through the defiles to\r\nRheims for his coronation. The coronation was a triumph of the Guises.\r\nFor far from being set back by the death of the cardinal of Lorraine\r\non December 29, at Avignon[1688] their star seemed to be higher than\r\nbefore. The cardinal of Guise took the place of his deceased uncle as\r\nprimate of Rheims; the duke of Guise was grand chamberlain; and the\r\nduke of Mayenne and the marquis d’Elbœuf were the chief lay peers.\r\nThe sole outsider was De Retz who officiated as constable for the\r\noccasion. The crowning took place on February 15. Shortly after the\r\nevent, apparently in a sudden whim of passion, Henry III married Louise\r\nde Vaudmont, whose father was uncle of the duke of Lorraine and whose\r\nmother had been sister of the unfortunate Egmont. But the marriage was\r\nwithout political significance—indeed the new queen was of so little\r\nstation that Catherine de Medici, in a letter to Queen Elizabeth,\r\nexpressed her humiliation at her son’s marriage.[1689]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARQUEBUSIER\r\n\r\n(Tortorel and Perissin)]\r\n\r\nThe main issues of France, religious toleration and political reform,\r\nwere now more obscured than ever by the rivalry of the factions around\r\nthe throne. The queen mother bore the Guises greater hatred than before\r\nbecause of their new ascendency and had little less spleen toward the\r\nMontmorencys, but carefully dissimulated and sought on one pretext\r\nand another to remove them from around her son. For this purpose\r\nBellegarde, who was an old attaché of the house of Montmorency and\r\nowed his popularity with the King to a handsome face and a well-turned\r\nleg, was made a special ambassador to Poland in order to get him out\r\nof the way. His comrade on the mission was Elbœuf—an ill-matched\r\npair indeed. Their business was to carry 200,000 crowns of the Paris\r\nbourgeois to Poland to bribe the Polish diet not to elect a successor\r\nto the absent Henry. If the Poles were obdurate, Elbœuf was to advocate\r\nthe election of the duke of Ferrara, who had Guisard blood in his\r\nveins. At the same time Biron and Matignon were made marshals to\r\ncounterpoise the influence of De Retz who forthwith resigned his office\r\nand vowed he would “meddle no more.” There were heart-burnings, also,\r\nover the bestowal of the government of Normandy, vacated by the death\r\nof the duke of Bouillon. The duke of Nevers claimed that it had been\r\npromised him while in Poland; the duchess of Nemours demanded the post\r\nfor the duke and declared that Nevers was “a foreigner.” Henry III\r\nfinally sought to compromise by giving the office to his insignificant\r\nfather-in-law, whereupon the duke of Nevers quit the court in a rage.\r\nSquabbles of precedence, too, vexed the King’s mind. Montpensier\r\nchallenged the claims of the Guises to court precedence before the\r\nParlement, and Madame de Nemours therefore quarreled with her daughter.\r\n“They were all bent to preparations of war,” quaintly wrote Dale to\r\nWalsingham, “but these domestic discords do tame them. It is a very\r\nhell among them, not one content or in quiet with another, nor mother\r\nwith son, nor brother with brother, nor mother with daughter.”[1690]\r\n\r\nThe state of the finances was deplorable, and Henry resorted to various\r\ndevices to provide himself with funds. The mission of Elbœuf and\r\nBellegarde to Poland was delayed, while the King implored the Pope,\r\nthe duke of Savoy, and Venice for the money needed;[1691] the pay\r\nof the King’s household servants was nine months in arrears and the\r\nlast money wages of his guards had been paid by an assessment levied\r\nby the King upon the noblemen and gentlemen of the court. Paris, as\r\nusual, was heavily mulcted by a forced loan of 600,000 francs, besides\r\nheavy contributions extorted from the foreign merchants there. But the\r\nmass of the money had to come from the church lands. A letter-patent\r\nin the form of an edict was forced through the Parlement authorizing\r\nthe alienation of 200,000 livres de rente of the temporalities of\r\nthe clergy, the King reckoning to raise a million and a half of\r\nfrancs by the process, but few were ready purchasers. In addition to\r\nthese practices the “parties casuelles” were farmed to a Florentine\r\nmoney-broker named Diaceto for 60,000 francs per month. Henry III\r\nresorted to worse expedients than these, though. He sold four seats\r\nin his council for 15,000 livres each; forced the collectors of\r\nthe revenue to anticipate the revenue for a twelve-month and then\r\ndispossessed them of their posts after he had deprived them of the\r\nprofits thereof and sold them to others; and dilapidated the forest\r\ndomain by selling two trees in each arpent.[1692]\r\n\r\nThe position and conduct of Damville afforded the greatest hope for\r\nthe future if Henry III could have been made to see things in the\r\nright way. Damville himself dominated all Languedoc and Provence;\r\nhis lieutenant, Montbrun, controlled Dauphiné; Turenne was in\r\npossession of Auvergne; the Rochellois had agents at court seeking\r\nfor a firm settlement of affairs; even the cardinal Bourbon and the\r\nduke of Montpensier leaned to the side of the Politiques. In 1575 the\r\nexistence of the old party of Huguenots, the Huguenots of religion,\r\nwas practically at an end. Individual radical Calvinists there were\r\nin plenty but the Protestant _organization_ was that of the political\r\nHuguenots.\r\n\r\nIt was manifest by the spring of 1575 that the prince of Condé and\r\nHenry of Navarre on the one hand, and Damville and his brother,\r\ntogether with Alençon, were bound to join hands in the common purpose\r\nto establish permanent religious and greater civil liberty in France.\r\n“Liberty and reform” was the policy of the hour, if not the watchword.\r\nThe declaration of the assembly of Milhau in August of the previous\r\nyear had been the handwriting on the wall—a message which the\r\nmisguided Henry III obdurately refused to read. On April 25, 1575, that\r\nmessage was repeated in even clearer terms in the form of a manifesto\r\nissued by Damville which defined the joint policy of the Politiques and\r\nthe political Huguenots. It was the declaration of a patriot, and not\r\na partisan, least of all a rebel, who, like Cromwell, found himself\r\ncompelled to lead a movement for political reform against an obstinate\r\ncrown that either would not or could not understand the issues.[1693]\r\n\r\nReading between the lines of the constitution agreed upon at Nîmes,\r\nthe republican nature of the government therein provided for is\r\nnoticeable.[1694] The right to exercise the sovereign rights of\r\nlegislation, of justice, of taxation, of making war and peace, of\r\nregulating commerce no longer were vested in the King where the Act of\r\nUnion prevailed, but in a representative body. Languedoc, Provence, and\r\nDauphiné were _de facto_ independent of the crown.[1695] Supplementary\r\narticles of Condé and Damville, and of the Catholics and Protestants of\r\nLanguedoc, Provence, and Dauphiné demanded (1) that freedom of exercise\r\nof religion without distinction be permitted; (2) that the parlements\r\nshould be composed half of Catholics, and half of Protestants, the\r\nlatter to be nominated by the prince of Condé; (3) that justice be\r\ndone upon the authors of the massacre of St. Bartholomew and the\r\nforfeit and attainder of the admiral be reversed; (4) that the places\r\nat present held by the Huguenots be retained besides Boulogne and La\r\nCharité, and that for additional defense the King should give them in\r\neach province two out of three towns to be named to him by the prince\r\nof Condé; (5) that the King pay 200,000 crowns for expenses of the\r\nwar; (6) that neither the marshal de Retz, nor the chancellor Biragues\r\nshould have any part in the negotiations for peace; (7) that the duke\r\nof Montmorency and the marshal Cossé should be set at liberty, and\r\ntheir innocence declared in full Parlement “en robe rouge;” (8) that\r\nthe heirs of those who have been murdered should have their estates\r\nreturned to them; (9) that the queen of England, the elector palatine,\r\nand the dukes of Savoy and Deuxponts should be parties to the peace;\r\n(10) that within three months after peace the States-General be\r\nassembled to establish good order in France.[1696]\r\n\r\nFor a while there seemed to be a prospect of the King yielding to these\r\ndemands. He was growing jealous of the influence of the Guises, and\r\nbegan to perceive that coercion was impossible.[1697] At the first\r\naudience Henry received the deputies graciously, saying he “liked\r\ntheir speech, but their articles were hard.” The articles were debated\r\n_seriatim_ by the King, both with the deputies and with the council.\r\nThe chief hitch was upon the fourth demand. The King was willing to\r\npermit exercise of Protestant worship in _one_ town in each bailiwick,\r\n_except closed_ towns, whereas the deputies demanded freedom of worship\r\nin all places _in the suburbs_ as provided by the Edict of January. As\r\na matter of prudence, it would seem to have been better policy for the\r\ncrown to permit worship in the suburbs of all towns rather than exact\r\na provision requiring concentration of the Protestants in one place in\r\neach bailiwick; however, the King probably thought Calvinism would be\r\nless likely to spread under such a restriction than if the Huguenots\r\nenjoyed numerous places of worship.[1698] The queen mother sought to\r\npersuade Montmorency to use his influence to abate the demands with\r\npromise of release from the Bastille as his reward. But the duke\r\nreplied that “if his imprisonment might do the King pleasure or profit\r\nhe was content to be there all his life; but to meddle in the peace,\r\nor to write of that matter, never understanding their doings, were to\r\nmake himself guilty in it, and to be thought to make himself to be an\r\ninstrument to their ruin, and therefore it were ill for him.”[1699]\r\nThereupon Henry III broke off the negotiations hoping still, as\r\nearlier, to be able to separate the Huguenots and the united Catholics.\r\n\r\nEvents thereafter thickened rapidly. Narbonne, Perigueux, and Tournon\r\nin Lyonnais were taken by the Huguenot-Politique armies. The last place\r\nwas got by Damville himself. Tournon was an especially strong town on\r\nthe Rhone about three leagues from Valence, with Livron to the south\r\nof it. The capture so discouraged the duke d’Uzes that he requested\r\nleave to resign on account of the desertions among his following.[1700]\r\nInstead command was given him, “to spoil Languedoc in order to famish\r\nthem against winter.” But the duke was too wise to obey and Damville\r\nwas permitted to gather in the harvest without molestation. For if\r\nthe King had tried ravaging, the whole country would have risen\r\nagainst him. St. Jean-d’Angély, Angoulême, and Nérac revolted so far\r\nas to expel the garrisons in the town. In Burgundy, where Tavannes\r\nhad founded the League of the Holy Spirit, a Politique league was\r\nformed.[1701] The narrow escape Damville had at this time from death\r\nby poison drew men more than ever to him. As a climax to the woes of\r\nHenry III on July 15, 1575, the Polish diet declared the throne vacant,\r\nabsolving all from allegiance to him.[1702]\r\n\r\nThe _spontaneous_ nature of the rising of the country in the summer\r\nof 1575 is an interesting historical phenomenon. It was by no means\r\nconfined to the south of France. In Champagne, the nobles, some of\r\nthem vassals of Guise, and _peasants_ united to fall upon the reiters.\r\nMadame de Guise fled from Joinville in fear of being surprised by a\r\nsixteenth-century Jacquerie. In Brittany there was a similar stir\r\nwhen the King attempted to confiscate the extensive lands of the duke\r\nof Rohan upon his death. Certain things remind one of happenings in\r\nthe French Revolution. Many in Champagne left the land and went into\r\nthe borders of Germany like the “émigrés” after August 4, 1789. In\r\nParis there were house-to-house visits not unlike those of September,\r\n1793. There was universal feeling against the reiters. In Normandy\r\nan association of gentlemen was formed for the special purpose of\r\nprotecting the country from them.[1703]\r\n\r\nThe anxiety of the government was all the greater because it was\r\nnot exactly known what relations existed between the Huguenots and\r\nPolitiques and the English. The treaty which had obtained between\r\nCharles IX and Elizabeth was renewed by the latter on April 1, 1575,\r\nand confirmed by Henry III on May 4.[1704] But Elizabeth was not the\r\nperson to be bound by official word. On the Picardy-Flemish border\r\nmutual distrust prevailed. In December, 1574, Requesens had advised\r\nPhilip II of his fear of the renewal of Huguenot activity in the Low\r\nCountries, which had been dead since the Genlis disaster,[1705] and the\r\ngarrisons on the frontiers had been increased accordingly. The marriage\r\nof Henry III to Louise de Vaudemont gave the Spanish governor great\r\ninquietude, for the unfortunate Egmont was her uncle, and Egmont’s\r\neldest son, in March, visited his royal cousin of France.[1706]\r\nRequesens was apprehensive, too, of a marriage between the duke of\r\nAlençon and the daughter of William of Orange,[1707] and over the fact\r\nthat the French envoy in Flanders, the sieur de Mondoucet, prudently\r\navoided using the official post, but employed his own couriers in\r\ndispatching missives to Paris.[1708] “All the neighboring states are\r\nactuated by malicious intentions,” he wailed to Philip II. “The French\r\nand the English are in correspondence, and both are inspired by the\r\nsame spirit of hostility against the Catholic religion and against your\r\nmajesty, as the sole protector thereof.”[1709]\r\n\r\nThe arrest of a secretary of Montmorency at Boulogne in March, as\r\nhe arrived from England, and who admitted he was going to find\r\nDamville,[1710] coupled with the absence of the prince of Condé and\r\nCharles de Meru, the youngest Montmorency, in Germany, so disquieted\r\nthe King that early in June Schomberg was dispatched across the Rhine\r\nto discover what Condé was doing; if he found that levies of cavalry\r\nwere being made for service in France, he was instructed to enroll\r\n8,000 soldiers for the service of the King.\r\n\r\nSchomberg proved a good agent, for he shortly afterward wrote that he\r\nbelieved a secret engagement existed between Queen Elizabeth, some of\r\nthe German princes, and the enemies of the French King at home; and\r\nthat Condé, having expended 30,000 crowns, had raised 8,000 cavalry\r\nwhich might be expected to arrive at the frontier by the middle of\r\nAugust, although it was given out, and believed by some, that these\r\nreiters were intended for service in the Netherlands.[1711] On the\r\nstrength of these suspicions, especially when the duke of Guise sent\r\nword in the first week of September that 2,500 reiters had crossed\r\nthe Rhine, the English ambassador, Dr. Dale, who hitherto had lodged\r\nin the Faubourg St. Germain, was advised to remove into the city,\r\nostensibly for his greater security, but really to prevent him from\r\nreceiving unknown persons secretly at night, as was possible where he\r\nresided.[1712]\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, when everything was tense and everybody was on\r\nedge, the duke of Alençon managed to make his escape from the\r\ncourt (September 15). While not actually confined, like the duke\r\nof Montmorency, he and Henry of Navarre had both been kept under\r\ncontinuous surveillance for months and various efforts made by them\r\nto get away had failed. Dismay prevailed at court when the escape was\r\nknown. The King was “as a man out of courage,” and betook himself to\r\nextravagant religious demonstration, as before, when at Avignon, “going\r\nfrom church, as though deserted by all his people.”[1713] He knew that\r\nhis brother’s presence would draw many of the gentry, who were yet\r\nhesitating, to the ranks of the Politiques.[1714] He had no means to\r\nlevy an army, nor the resources to sustain it.\r\n\r\nIn this crisis Catherine de Medici kept the clearest head of all at\r\nthe court. While she sought to wheedle the runaway prince with smooth\r\nwords, going as far as Dreux to meet him, detachments were ordered out\r\nfrom Rouen, Orleans, and Chartres to surround him. But Alençon was not\r\nto be trapped and rode swiftly off toward the Loire in the hope of\r\nfalling in with La Noue or the viscount of Turenne. At the same time\r\nthe duke of Guise was ordered to make a vigorous resistance against\r\nthe coming of Condé’s reiters. But even his army was in a bad state\r\non account of the defection of officers and men, who had gone over\r\nto Alençon, so that new troops had to be sent him.[1715] Almost all\r\nthe soldiery in the service of the King was withdrawn from Dauphiné\r\nand Languedoc and concentrated in Burgundy and Champagne.[1716] Much\r\ndepended upon the result of the coming battle with the reiters. If the\r\nKing’s troops were beaten, Paris would be in a serious strait between\r\nthe King’s enemies. Already, in consequence of the withdrawal of\r\ntroops, all Auvergne, Bourbonnais, Nivernais, Gâtinais, and the Beauce\r\nwere in arms, and the gentlemen of these regions had gone over to the\r\nduke of Alençon. Only the vigilance of the garrisons at Orleans and\r\nTours, Moulins and Nevers, enabled the crown to maintain the line of\r\nthe Loire river.\r\n\r\nThe reiters attempted to evade Guise and find another way of entrance\r\ninto France, so that the duke left his artillery in Lorraine and by\r\nforced marches went to Sedan, with the intention of giving battle\r\nthere. But the reiters, about 2,500, under Thoré, avoided an engagement\r\nand maneuvered to join a Protestant force of 2,000 Picards, and Guise\r\nfell back on Rheims in order to hold the crossing of the Aisne,\r\nmeantime asking the King for reinforcements which were so slow in\r\ncoming that the duke was compelled to retire to the Marne. On October\r\n9 he established his headquarters between Château-Thierry and Epernay,\r\nnear Port-à-Pinson. The encounter took place near Fismes, on the Marne,\r\nabove Dormans, on October 10. Not more than fifty were killed on either\r\nside and the combat did not deter the reiters from continuing their\r\ncourse and crossing the Seine near Nogent-sur-Seine, which they were\r\nable to do on account of low water. Their chief loss was of two or\r\nthree cornets of reiters whom Guise bribed to desert. De Thoré owed\r\nhis easy escape, however, to the serious wound which the duke of Guise\r\nsustained. For a bullet struck him in the side of the face, tearing his\r\near clear away and so mangling the cheek that he was fearfully scarred\r\nfor the rest of his life and always wore a velvet mask.[1717]\r\n\r\nThe insignificance of the victory of the duke, however, did not deter\r\nthe King from proclaiming a solemn procession and _Te Deum_ in honor of\r\nthe day. The “victory” also was made the justification of a new tax.\r\nOn October 12, 1575, by command of the King, the burgesses of Paris\r\nassembled in the grand room of the Hôtel-de-Ville where the provost of\r\nthe merchants, Charron, made known a new demand of the King for aid in\r\nthe form of a capitation tax upon the burgesses of the city and other\r\nplaces in the _prévôté_ of Paris for the payment of 3,000 Swiss, making\r\nhalf of the 6,000 which the King required for defense of the realm, in\r\naddition to the sum of 15,000 francs expected for each of the ensuing\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nOnce again were the people of Champagne made the victims of the\r\nspoiler. All the horses of the poor laborers whom the reiters\r\nencountered on the road were forcibly seized, as was also the case in\r\nthe hostelries where they lodged. A single parish lost thirty horses.\r\nThe only payment the poor peasantry got was to be beaten for their\r\nprotests.\r\n\r\n For the space of three or four days one might see along the roads and\r\n in the villages soldiers all of the time, making for the crossing\r\n of the Seine at La Motte de Tilly. Two troopers rode one horse and\r\n their presence was hard upon the merchants and the priests, whom\r\n they met in the way. The smaller merchants were despoiled of their\r\n property, and those known to be wealthy had their riches extorted from\r\n them by force, or else were held prisoner until ransomed. To make\r\n matters worse, in the wake of the army came a rabble of looters and\r\n plunderers, mostly French.[1718]\r\n\r\nIt was obvious that as long as the reiters were in the field, the King\r\ncould send no force against his brother. He blamed the queen mother\r\nfor everything that had happened, especially for the escape of Alençon,\r\nand Catherine, by way of reply, is said to have sent him a copy of\r\nCommines to read with the advice to emulate the policy of his crafty\r\npredecessor. But as a contemporary scornfully observed, Henry of Valois\r\nwas not Louis XI. What could be expected from a King who spent his time\r\n“going from abbey to abbey and devising with women.”[1719] In sorrow\r\nand anxiety, sustained by the dukes of Montmorency and Montpensier and\r\nthe fine old marshal Cossé, Catherine made earnest efforts to negotiate\r\na truce with the duke of Alençon.\r\n\r\nPrefacing his demands by the caution that he could not negotiate\r\nfinally without Condé or Damville, Alençon demanded surrender of\r\nPont-de-Cé on the Loire, besides La Charité, Bourges, Angoulême,\r\nNiort, Saumur, and Angers for the Huguenots; and Mezières in\r\nChampagne, Langres in Burgundy, or La Fère in Picardy for the prince\r\nof Condé;[1720] a large settlement for himself; a promise that the\r\nStates-General should be convened for the Politiques; the crown to pay\r\n200,000 crowns to the Protestant reiters; the exercise of Calvinist\r\nworship in as ample terms as obtained in 1570 (till more fully provided\r\nfor in the ultimate articles of peace); the revolted provinces to\r\nremain in arms, except in the case of mercenaries, it being understood\r\nthat no acts of hostility be done and commerce and trade to be free\r\nduring the interim. The King’s council, when these sweeping terms\r\nwere laid before it, advised the King to yield, seeing no way out on\r\naccount of lack of means to carry on the war. But Henry III was furious\r\nand threw the articles in the fire. In defiance of the advice of his\r\nfriends, who told him to employ what few funds he had in corrupting the\r\nreiters with Condé, he sent 30,000 crowns more to Germany to purchase\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nIn this strait, money came suddenly, as from heaven. The papal nuncio\r\nproffered 100,000 crowns at once and promised 200,000 more, while the\r\nVenetian government, in memory of his visit there in the year previous,\r\nmade him a gift of his jewels that were in pawn. Finally, to crown\r\nthe King’s jubilation at this sudden turn of events, word came from\r\nGermany that the reiters hired by Schomberg and Bassompierre were\r\ncoming “and would not be stayed by the truce.” Henry III at once broke\r\noff negotiations. The hope was to sever Alençon from the prince of\r\nCondé and then, preferably by bribery, by war if necessary, overcome\r\nthe latter, for Schomberg persuaded the King that this course was\r\npracticable. To this end commissioners were sent abroad to levy new\r\ntaxes.[1721] Great ingenuity was shown in the devising of new forms of\r\ntaxation. In June, 1575, two edicts had been issued, one requiring the\r\nfixing of new seals to bolts of woolen cloth and the establishment of\r\na _greffier des tailles_ in each parish;[1722] the other creating the\r\noffice of four _arpenteurs_ (land commissioners) in each jurisdiction\r\nof the realm. The number of notaries was also augmented.[1723] In\r\nDecember the King made a pretext of the coming of the reiters to demand\r\na new subsidy from the pliant and obedient people of France, under\r\ncover of raising men for the war. Of the Parisians he demanded the sum\r\nof 200,000 livres, to pay three thousand Swiss. Another pretext was the\r\nrepair of the bridge at Charenton, which the Huguenots had broken in\r\n1567.[1724] These taxes fell all the more heavily because in addition\r\nto the ruin of the country by war, the crops were short throughout the\r\nland on account of the dry summer. “The rivers everywhere were so low\r\nthat in many places one could wade them. Every morning the sun rose and\r\nevery evening it set red and inflamed.”[1725]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, fear prevailed in Paris lest the forces of Damville\r\nand the viscount of Turenne would effect a junction with those of the\r\nduke of Alençon and the united body march upon Paris, and garrisons\r\nwere hastily put in Montereau, Corbeil, Charenton, St. Cloud, and St.\r\nDenis. The old trenches on both sides of the river were repaired and\r\nplatforms erected in the fields around the city. Montmartre especially\r\nwas fortified. The townspeople of the capital as well as villagers\r\nfrom the outside were impressed into the work with picks, shovels,\r\nand baskets. Mills were erected within the city, and the city was\r\nprovisioned. The King issued an edict ordering the peasantry within\r\nthirty leagues around the capital to thrash their grain and to store it\r\nin fortified towns known to be faithful to the crown, unless they were\r\ndwelling within nine leagues of Paris, in which case the grain was to\r\nbe brought into the city. All the passages of the Loire were guarded.\r\nThe result of all this was a reign of terror in the Ile-de-France.\r\nThe soldiery indulged in all sorts of brigandage, so that in sheer\r\ndesperation the villagers sometimes fired their towns. Provisions\r\nwere commandeered without recompense. To such outrages were the poor\r\npeople subjected that the inhabitants of one town, Jogny, begged the\r\ncommander to have mercy upon them. But instead of so doing, Puygaillard\r\nloaded the little deputation with reproaches and had them beaten by the\r\nsoldiers in the presence of all.[1726]\r\n\r\nWith the memory of the elder prince of Condé’s presence before the\r\nwalls of Paris, and the battle of St. Denis, where the constable\r\nMontmorency was killed, the Parisians were willing to labor in the\r\ntrenches for the safety of Paris. But they were not willing to be taxed\r\nfurther. In a remarkable remonstrance, joined in by the clergy, the\r\nParlement, the Chambre des Comptes, the Cour des Aides, the provost of\r\nParis, and the bourgeois and citizens of every quarter of the city,\r\nprotest was made against the extortion of 200,000 livres, which Henry\r\nIII proposed to raise in this hour of extremity. After reciting that\r\ncivil discord had prevailed in France since 1560, and that during the\r\nspace of fifteen years the crown had obtained 36,000,000 francs from\r\nParis and other towns, and 60,000,000 from the clergy, besides other\r\ngifts and subsidies, with little progress to show either in politics\r\nor religion, the memorial proceeded to point out some of the causes of\r\nthis universal corruption in scathing terms:\r\n\r\n Simony is openly permitted. Benefices are held by married gentlewomen\r\n who employ the revenues far differently to the intention of the\r\n founders. The people are left without religious instruction and\r\n thus stray from the true religion. There is but little justice to\r\n be obtained through the venality of the tribunals, causing their\r\n neighbors to hold them in abomination. The number of those holding\r\n office is very great and part of them notoriously incapable and the\r\n rest poor, being thereby prone to evil actions. Justice is further\r\n impeded by the impunity with which murder is committed. Great\r\n cruelties and barbarities are committed by the foot soldiers and\r\n by the gendarmerie, which does not now consist of gentlemen but of\r\n persons of vile condition. Not only by these, but by the soldiers of\r\n his guard, is pillage made on the houses of his people, ecclesiastical\r\n holdings, and hospitals even in Paris itself, so that the poor cannot\r\n obtain common necessaries.[1727]\r\n\r\nDuring these weeks Montmorency had earnestly labored in favor of peace,\r\npleading, arguing, expostulating both with his own younger brothers\r\nand Alençon. He was as earnestly supported by Catherine de Medici, now\r\nconverted to a peace policy by the force of events,[1728] but both\r\nwere continually thwarted either by the King’s inconstancy or the\r\nmachinations of the Guises.\r\n\r\nThe illness of the queen mother—she suffered so much from sciatica\r\nthat often she was unable to leave her chamber—and the frivolity of\r\nthe King were a positive advantage to the Guises’ policy.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the fortress of La Fère had been tentatively\r\ndemanded of the King for the prince of Condé. Henry III had replied\r\noffering Doulens in Picardy instead of either La Fère or Peronne, which\r\nwas later suggested, on the plea that he could not exact obedience from\r\nthe inhabitants of the latter places. This demand for a border fortress\r\nnear Flanders was made by the duke of Alençon, in reality to further\r\nhis own advantage in the Spanish Netherlands, and he took the method\r\nof having Condé take title to it as a means of concealing his purpose.\r\n\r\nThe possible disposal of any border fortress in Picardy in such a way\r\ntremendously alarmed the king of Spain and the Guises who concerted to\r\nbreak the peace.[1729] This plan is the true origin of the formation\r\nof the famous Holy League, which, although it assumed organized form\r\nonly after the peace of Bergerac (September 17, 1576), nevertheless\r\nexisted in a tentative state this early, in the combined action of the\r\ndukes of Guise, Nemours, Mayenne, and Nevers, Biragues the chancellor,\r\nand other satellites of the house of Guise to prevent peace being made\r\non such terms, and to break it in event of its being made.[1730] Twice\r\nthis cabal called upon the King to give battle before all the forces\r\nof the opposition were united and twice the queen mother foiled their\r\npurpose by securing delay. On February 22 a violent scene took place\r\nbetween her and the council—Henry III was sick—in which Catherine\r\nbranded those who said her son was a traitor as liars and declared that\r\nin spite of opposition “it shall be peace.”\r\n\r\nThe indifference of Henry III to the gravity of the situation and\r\nhis supreme egotism are remarkable, yet thoroughly in keeping with\r\nhis character. For hours together he would prate of poetry and\r\nphilosophy—“de primis causis, de sensu et sensibili and such like\r\nquestions”—with his favorites, in the retirement of a cabinet, while\r\nthe realm was going to rack and ruin. The Venetian ambassador describes\r\none of these symposiums with minute care in a dispatch of February 3,\r\n1576.\r\n\r\n For the last few days [he says] his Majesty has taken his pleasure\r\n by retiring into a small apartment which has no window, and to his\r\n apartment his Majesty summons four or five youths of the city who\r\n follow the profession of poets and light literature, and to meet\r\n these people his Majesty invites the Duke of Nevers, the Grand Prior,\r\n Biragues, Monseigneur, De Soure, the queen of Navarre, his sister,\r\n Madame de Nevers, and the marshal de Retz, all of whom profess to\r\n delight in poetry. When they are thus assembled his Majesty orders one\r\n of these youths to speak in praise of one of the virtues, exalting it\r\n above all the others, and as soon as he has concluded his reasoning\r\n each person in turn argues against the proposal which has been made.\r\n His Majesty consumes many hours in this exercise, to the small\r\n satisfaction of the queen mother and everybody else, who would desire\r\n to see in times so calamitous his Majesty attending to his urgent\r\n affairs, and not to amusements, which, however praiseworthy at other\r\n times, are now from the necessity of the case condemned by all, seeing\r\n that the King for this cause fails to be present at his council and\r\n there to discuss matters which are of the greatest importance and\r\n which having regard to his own position and that of his kingdom can\r\n easily be imagined to require attention.[1731]\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, the Guises’ determination to continue the war\r\ncomported with the wishes of some of their enemies—a circumstance\r\nwhich illustrates how singular was the alliance existing between\r\nthe Huguenots and the Politiques. The religious Huguenots already,\r\nin the middle of December, had remonstrated against the terms of\r\npeace proposed on the ground that the offers made did not promise\r\nas much of advantage or security as a continuation of the war. It\r\nwas argued that the truce would result in greater prejudice to them\r\nsince the King would still be prepared for war and that if they now\r\nlet the opportunity pass of establishing their fortune by the aid of\r\nthe reiters, the result would bring calamity to them.[1732] These\r\nnarrow-minded dissidents looked with ill favor upon the politic course\r\nof the duke of Alençon in avoiding the pillage of the towns he took,\r\neven of trusting to their loyalty and refraining from putting garrisons\r\nin them (some of these towns were Dreux, Romorantin, Thouars, and\r\nLoudun), and censured him for his pacific overtures to the Parlement\r\nof Paris.[1733] Accordingly they hailed with delight the escape of\r\nHenry of Navarre (February 5, 1576), and his immediate abjuration[1734]\r\nof the Catholic faith which he had been forced to confess on St.\r\nBartholomew’s Day, and the renewed advance of the reiters into\r\nBurgundy and Auvergne and thence across the Loire into Bourbonnais,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that these mounted mercenaries “made a\r\nterrible spoil with fire and fagots” wherever they went.\r\n\r\nThe reiters took the road toward Langres, crossed the Seine above\r\nChâtillon into Auxerre, making for the passage of the Loire River at\r\nLa Charité, in order to effect a junction with the duke of Alençon,\r\nwho was in Berry, not far from Bourges. Champagne and Brie were filled\r\nwith robbers in the wake of their advance, who, pretending that they\r\nwere soldiers, plundered the townspeople and robbed wayfarers and\r\ntravelers. There were regular bands of these freebooters, the members\r\nof which were paid regular wages by their captains. But the anarchy\r\nin the provinces did not compel the King to stop his dallying with\r\nphilosophy, or his love for mad-cap pranks. He went off on a Shrovetide\r\nfrolic in March, “riding about the town to cast eggs and such other\r\ndisorders,” leaving Mayenne to labor with those nobles who refused to\r\nbe commanded “by a boy that never saw wars and a soldiery whose pay\r\nwas a whole quarter in arrears.”[1735] Mayenne made his headquarters at\r\nMoulins to prevent the reiters uniting with Alençon and the Huguenots\r\nof Poitou and Guyenne. It required all the address of the marshal Biron\r\nto restrain the young commander from throwing himself upon them, almost\r\ncareless of the outcome, for defeat could have been little worse than\r\nthe daily shrinkage of his army from desertion.[1736]\r\n\r\nHenry III at first had pretended to make light of the escape of his\r\ncousin. But the presence of Henry of Navarre in the field soon had\r\nan important influence. It was the one thing needful to complete the\r\norganization of the Huguenots, many of whom looked upon the prince of\r\nCondé more as a Politique than as one of them. The harmonious working\r\nof the two parties opposed to the crown was now possible in greater\r\ndegree than before. Henry of Navarre, the prince of Condé, the duke\r\nof Alençon, and Damville united, were in a position to bring things\r\nto a focus. The actual territory controlled by Henry III at this time\r\nwas little, if any, greater than the ancient Ile-de-France, Burgundy,\r\nand Champagne of his ancestors in the twelfth century. The Huguenots\r\nand Politiques so divided the realm among themselves that a map of\r\nthe kingdom at this time reminds one of that of France in the feudal\r\nage. Henry of Navarre had made his headquarters at Saumur and thus\r\nwas able easily to control Anjou; the allegiance of Guyenne, Béarn,\r\nand Poitou was certain; the duke of Alençon was in occupation of\r\nthe “midlands”—Berry (except Bourges) and most of Bourbonnais and\r\nNivernais. Young Coligny, who had succeeded Montbrun, was in Dauphiné,\r\nand his fealty to the religion was unswerving; Damville and his\r\nlieutenants controlled all Languedoc, Provence, and Auvergne; young\r\nMontgomery was in Lower Normandy where English assistance secretly\r\nhelped him, while the prince of Condé, backed by the count palatine,\r\nendangered Picardy.\r\n\r\nThe winning cards were all in the hands of the Huguenots and the\r\nPolitiques. Without territory, without funds, with an unpaid army or\r\nhireling mercenaries only, the crown had no other recourse than to\r\naccept the situation and make peace unless Henry III and the queen\r\nmother stooped to the worse humiliation of receiving the support of\r\nPhilip II. And so it came to pass that while Paris daily expected to\r\nwithstand a siege and the faubourgs and gates were so crowded with\r\nthose living outside the walls and refugees from the environs “that\r\na man could scarce enter the gates for the people, carriages, and\r\ncattle,”[1737] Henry III signed the Act of Peace, May 2, 1576.\r\n\r\nThe peace of 1576, sometimes called the Peace of Monsieur, from the\r\nduke of Alençon’s prominent part in its formation, was the most\r\ncomplete and elaborate charter yet given the Huguenots, embodying\r\nthe wisdom that experience had taught. It is to be noticed that the\r\nsettlement involved both toleration of the religion and political\r\nreform. The provisions of this composite peace may be classified\r\nunder four heads, each of which was an essential element in the late\r\nopposition to the crown, viz:—the Huguenots, Henry of Navarre, the\r\nduke of Alençon, the Politiques.\r\n\r\nThe King granted to the Huguenots public exercise of the Calvinist\r\nreligion throughout France except within two leagues of the court and\r\nfour leagues of Paris. The Huguenots were declared eligible to all\r\noffices and dignities without discrimination on account of religion.\r\nAs a security for the King’s justice against possible abuse of these\r\nrights, the crown engaged to establish mixed parlements, half Catholic,\r\nhalf Protestant, at Poitiers, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Montpellier,\r\nGrenoble, Aix, Dijon, Rheims, and Rouen, and a new chamber in the\r\nParlement of Paris with two presidents and eighteen councilors,\r\nnine of them Catholic, nine Protestant. Protestant advocates,\r\n_procureurs-généraux_ and _greffiers_ civil and criminal were to be\r\nconnected with each of these mixed parlements.\r\n\r\nFor further protection of the Huguenots, eight cautionary towns were\r\nto be ceded to them, to wit: Aigues-Mortes and Beaucaire in Languedoc;\r\nPérigueux and Le Mas de Verdun in Guyenne; La Rochelle in Poitou;\r\nYssoire in Auvergne; Nions and Serres (château included) in Dauphiné;\r\nCennes “la grande tour et le circuit” in Provence. Additional demands\r\nwere for general oblivion for all conduct and action by persons of\r\neither side; revocation of all decrees, judgments, and proclamations\r\nhitherto made; rehabilitation of the memory of Admiral Coligny and\r\nrestoration of their livings and honors to his children as well as\r\nin the cases of Montgomery, Montbrun, Bricquemault, and Cavagnies.\r\nNo prosecution was to be made with regard to the actions done at St.\r\nGermain-en-Laye and Bois de Vincennes.\r\n\r\nTwo of these provisions were received with great dissatisfaction by\r\nthe Huguenot deputies and when published were decried by many of the\r\nProtestants. The first of them was the prohibition of Protestant\r\nworship within the faubourgs of Paris, the act specifically declaring\r\nthat St. Denis, St. Maur-des-Fosses, Pont-de-Charenton, Bourg-la-Reine\r\nand Port de Neuilly were within the prohibited confines. The other\r\none which met with great objection was that touching the security\r\ntowns.[1738] The deputies demanded two towns in every government (there\r\nwere fourteen governments). But the King would yield only eight, these\r\nto be chosen from the towns already in possession of the Huguenots, a\r\nproviso which eliminated such important points as Niort, Angoulême, and\r\nCognac. In the case of La Charité and Saumur, over which the longest\r\ndiscussion arose, a compromise was reached by giving them to Alençon\r\nin appanage. Long and acrimonious debate was made over this article,\r\nand at one stage the negotiations were so nearly broken off that Paris\r\nwas notified to be prepared for a renewal of the war. The crown’s\r\ndemands in this matter were really not unreasonable, for these eight\r\ntowns were not included in the number given to Henry of Navarre or the\r\nprince of Condé, or in the appanage of the duke of Alençon.[1739]\r\n\r\nIf the demands of the Huguenots were excessive, those of Henry of\r\nNavarre were still more sweeping. He not only aimed to live like a king\r\nin the future in his own country of Béarn, but sought to commit the\r\ncrown to the recovery of the kingdom of Navarre as well. All the past\r\nclaims and grievances of his ancestry were embodied. He demanded: That\r\nthe King of Navarre command in his government of Guyenne extending from\r\nPilles to Bayonne, in such manner as his ancestors had done; that all\r\ncaptains and governors obey him as the governor and lieutenant-general\r\nof the King; that he have the providing of the necessary garrisons;\r\nthat all his lands and seignories should recognize no other government\r\nthan he appointed and that all towns and fortresses belonging to\r\nhim should be at once surrendered; that his right to his kingdom be\r\npreserved, and that his subjects should not be taxed for the services\r\nof the king of France, according to their ancient immunities; that all\r\ngentlemen being his servants, officers, or subjects should come and go\r\nand traffic freely through all France without molestation; that his\r\nofficers and servants should enjoy such privileges as if they served\r\nthe royal family of France; that he and his heirs should be discharged\r\nfrom the guarantee given by himself and his mother toward the purchases\r\nof ecclesiastical property, and for the payment of the reiters; that in\r\nview of the fact that the late king had granted 200,000 livres to his\r\nmother, the late queen of Navarre, for the celebration of the nuptials\r\nof himself and his queen, the King’s sister, which has never been paid,\r\nand furthermore, because there was also yet due 120,000 livres, arrears\r\nof the pension of the late king of Navarre, he prayed the King to deal\r\nwith him as favorably as he could for payment; that if any offices or\r\nbenefices fell vacant in seignories of the king of Navarre, he should\r\nhave the nominating and presenting of such persons; that the King\r\nwould preserve to him in his lands and seignories his privileges and\r\naccustomed sources of revenue, such as the _droit de tabellionage_ and\r\n_de sceaux_.\r\n\r\nHaving so far required everything that could conceivably be based\r\nupon things present, Henry endeavored to revive the ancient claims of\r\nhis house in a startling fashion. The old feudal spirit of William\r\nof Aquitaine and Raymond of Toulouse seems to have been reincarnated\r\nin his person at this time. For Henry demanded further that he be\r\nrecompensed for the 6,000 livres promised in time past, in virtue of\r\nthe right that Françoise de Bretagne, wife of Aleyne, sieur d’Albret,\r\nfather of John of Navarre, had had to the duchy of Brittany.[1740] But\r\neven this was not all, for Henry of Navarre finally made the demand\r\nthat the pension of 46,000 livres which his grandfather had enjoyed in\r\nrecompense for the loss of Navarre, from which his great grandfather\r\nhad been expelled in 1512 by Ferdinand of Aragon, be continued to him,\r\nand _that the King of France should promise to help him to recover\r\nNavarre!_[1741]\r\n\r\nIn the nature of things, not a tithe of these demands could be granted\r\nby the crown, least of all the last. The massacre of St. Bartholomew\r\nhad proved how perilous it was to try to drive Catholic France into a\r\nwar with Spain, and France was less ready now than in 1570-72 to join\r\nbattle with Philip. Perforce Henry of Navarre had to be content with a\r\nrestoration of things as they were on August 24, 1572.[1742]\r\n\r\nThe duke of Alençon had created for him a position stronger than that\r\nof Henry of Navarre. As a prince of the blood and as a Politique\r\nhe occupied middle ground between the crown and the Huguenots;\r\nin consequence, many of the places which neither of the chief\r\nprincipals was willing to resign were included in the grant to him.\r\nWhile technically all the territories so concerned were regarded\r\nas appanages,[1743] it is plain that a distinction may easily be\r\nmade between the duchies of Alençon, Maine, Anjou, Touraine, and\r\nLa Roche—which had originally been given him as a prince of the\r\nblood—and places like Bourges, Moulins, Loches, Saumur, La Charité,\r\nPont-de-Sel, Amiens, Moulans, and Mantes. These latter possessions were\r\npractically a class apart of security cities intrusted by compromise to\r\nthe duke. This was particularly true of Saumur and La Charité, which\r\ninsured the Protestants of passage across the lower and upper Loire,\r\nand so linked the South with Normandy on the North and the Palatinate\r\nand the German Protestant states to the east. Moreover, Moulins in\r\nBourbonnais and Bourges in Berry assured the Protestants of position\r\nthere, so that the whole left bank of the Loire from Auvergne to Nantes\r\nwas in their control. Mantes was meant to compensate the Huguenots in\r\nthe vicinity of Paris for the loss of Charenton.\r\n\r\nThe King yielded the government of Picardy again to the prince of\r\nCondé, but the matter of what town should be his created much heated\r\nargument. The prince himself at first stoutly contended for Boulogne,\r\nalthough he did not say that its convenience to England was the chief\r\nreason for his desire. But Henry III as stoutly refused. Then Amiens\r\nwas suggested, and as compromise this city was given to the King’s\r\nbrother. Condé then demanded Peronne. Although the King would have\r\npreferred Doulens or even St. Quentin to this concession, he yielded.\r\nThe only other detail concerning the prince was the obligation to pay\r\nhis and his father’s debts in Germany, which the crown assumed.\r\n\r\nDamville did not come in for as much honor as his colleagues, but\r\nwas far from being ignored. As the chief of the Politiques or “les\r\ncatholiques associez,” as they were defined in the interest of peace,\r\nDamville was and remained the leading man in Languedoc. Aside from\r\nthe retention of Damville in his government, promise was made the\r\nPolitiques to summon the States-General at Blois within six months for\r\nthe reformation and reorganization of the administration.[1744]\r\n\r\nIt follows as a matter of course that the maintenance and protection of\r\nthe multitude of social and civil rights that made the web and woof of\r\na civilized society was guaranteed, such as the validity of Protestant\r\nmarriage, land and property titles, freedom of education, commerce and\r\ntrade, etc.\r\n\r\nA very delicate matter to adjust was the future relation of the\r\nelectoral count palatine and the duke John Casimir, his son. A\r\nsecret alliance had existed between the count palatine, England, and\r\nthe prince of Condé since July, 1575. In November, Alençon and the\r\nPolitiques joined the alliance. One of the terms of that alliance was\r\nthat Metz, Toul, and Verdun were to pass to Casimir as the price of\r\nhis support and both Huguenots and Politiques—at least Alençon—stood\r\npledged to assist him in securing these Three Bishoprics. But it\r\nwas manifestly impossible to expect the French crown to grant such\r\na cession, nor is it probable, now that peace had come, that any in\r\nFrance looked with amiability upon this article of the contract of\r\nHeidelberg. It were too great a humiliation to have this brilliant\r\nconquest of 1552 thus passively surrendered. Fortunately it was found\r\npossible to placate John Casimir with less distinguished sacrifices.\r\nHis claims were purchased for an enormous sum of money—or at least\r\nthe promise of it; no less than two million florins (three million\r\nfrancs), part to be paid in the coming June and the balance at the next\r\ntwo fairs at Frankfurt, in addition to which he received the whole\r\nseigneury of Château-Thierry[1745]—worth 20,000 francs per annum—a\r\nperpetual colonelcy of 4,000 horse, a company of 100 men-at-arms and\r\n12 reitmeisters, all of which was confirmed by Henry III’s declaration\r\nthat he would “repute and esteem the count palatine and Duke Casimir as\r\ngood neighbors.”\r\n\r\nThe terms of the Peace of Monsieur[1746] were exceedingly unpopular\r\nin Paris, whose citizens had been the heaviest contributors to the\r\nexpenses of the war thus closed and who had made strenuous military\r\npreparations in defense of the capital, and the unpopularity of Henry\r\nIII was not enhanced in the eyes of the Parisians by the King’s\r\nrepudiation of a part of the _rentes_, the incomes of which were the\r\nchief means of support with many. But when Charron, the provost of\r\nthe merchants, and the counselor Abot, at the head of a deputation\r\nof the foremost citizens of the capital protested against this\r\nhigh-handed action to the King’s own face, Henry III with a sneer which\r\ncarried with it a covert threat rejoined: “Hang a man and he tells no\r\ntales.”[1747]\r\n\r\nThe camps of the duke of Alençon and the Protestants were broken up\r\nwhen the peace was published. The soldiery around La Rochelle and in\r\nPoitou, Anjou, and Berry, returned home, except some troops which were\r\nreserved until it was seen what Casimir and his reiters, who were near\r\nLangres, would do. These marauders with many French of Champagne and\r\nBrie, crossed the Yonne above Sens and arrived in Champagne between\r\nMay 10 and 11 and remained there for a week, living on the land.\r\nAfter having sojourned six or seven days between the Seine and the\r\nVauluisant, on the 16th they moved on to a place between Troyes and the\r\nvillage of Mery-sur-Seine, where they remained for fifteen days to the\r\ndistress of the people and absolutely destroyed the little village of\r\nMarigny, which had but two persons left in it. In order to find food\r\nthey foraged for miles. The peasantry turned their cattle loose or\r\ndrove them, together with their possessions, into the fortified towns\r\nor châteaux. But the gentry were less safe than the peasantry even,\r\nfor the latter had already been so despoiled that nothing was left to\r\nbe taken. Out of this frightful state of affairs rose an organized\r\nresistance which is very interesting to observe, for the nobility and\r\ngentry of the region and the local peasantry, forgetting their class\r\nantagonism, made common cause together. Whenever these “vigilance\r\ncommittees” found themselves to be stronger or happened upon stragglers\r\nfrom the main band, they threw themselves upon them; sometimes the\r\nvictims were bound and cast alive in the river Aube or Seine. Between\r\nSt. Loup-de-la-Fosse-Gelane and St. Martin-de-Bossenay, a group of ten\r\nor twelve reiters were thus set upon and only one escaped. But the\r\nvengeance their comrades meted out upon the offenders was terrible, for\r\nthe troopers, numbering over a hundred horsemen, the next night burned\r\nall the villages round about.[1748]\r\n\r\nNot until September was this scourge removed from the land. By that\r\ntime they were bought off and were conducted to the frontier by\r\nBassompierre, the Alsatian gentleman in the King’s service, who was\r\nwell rewarded, as he deserved to be, for the accomplishment of the\r\nperilous task. But the licensing of the regular troops immediately\r\nafterward still prolonged the agony of the province for a season.[1749]\r\n\r\nThe Peace of Monsieur may fittingly be said to have terminated the\r\nperiod of the _religious_ wars of France. The dominant issue of the\r\nsucceeding years of conflict from 1576 to 1598 was not a religious,\r\nbut a political one. Why permanent peace did not result it is not the\r\nwork of this volume to narrate. Suffice to say that Spain and Spain’s\r\ninstrument, the Holy League, were to blame for the ensuing years of\r\nstrife.\r\n\r\nThe germ of the provincial Catholic leagues had been the desire, on the\r\npart of the Catholics of France, to resist the progress of Calvinism.\r\nBut in the hands of the French nobles these local leagues, controlled\r\nby the aristocracy and welded into one mighty organization under the\r\nleadership of the duke of Guise, backed by Spanish gold, became a new\r\nleague of the public weal, which, under the cloak of religion revived\r\nthe feudal ambition of the French nobility to acquire power at the\r\nexpense of the crown.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHÂTILLON—COLIGNY\r\n\r\n  John III, † 1480\r\n         │\r\n         ├——————————————————┐\r\n         │                  │\r\n     James II     Gaspard I, married\r\n      † 1512            † 1522\r\n                            │\r\n         ┌——————————————————┼————————————————————————┐\r\n         │                  │                        │\r\n       Odet,    Gaspard II, Admiral Coligny  François d’Andelot\r\n     bishop of          murdered at                † 1569\r\n      Beauvais     St. Bartholomew, 1572\r\n       † 1571               │\r\n                            │\r\n     Louise m. _a_) Charles de Teligny,  † 1572\r\n               _b_) William the Silent\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTMORENCY\r\n\r\n                                 William,  † 1531\r\n                                        │\r\n       ┌————————————————————————————————┤\r\n       │                                │\r\n   Louise of     Anne, d. of Montmorency and constable of France,\r\n  Montmorency      killed at battle of St. Denis, 1567\r\n                                        │\r\n          ┌—————————————————┬———————————┴—————┬—————————————┬——————————┐\r\n          │                 │                 │             │          │\r\n  Francis, Marshal  Henry Damville,  Gabriel, sieur de   Charles,  William,\r\n     Montmorency      governor of    Montberon, killed     sieur     sieur\r\n       † 1579          Languedoc     at battle of Dreux  de Méru   de Thoré\r\n                          † 1614             1562\r\n                             │\r\n                    ┌————————┴——————————┐\r\n                    │                   │\r\n                Henry II,   Charlotte, m.

Onde meritamente da quel tempo in quà è\r\nparso a Sua Santità di uolere andare un poco più consideratamente, non\r\ngiudicando che se gli conuenisse di doversi ingenire in cosa d’altri\r\npiù oltre di quelche fosse grato alli Padroni, sperando pure, che come\r\nl’ era affirmato, così asseueratamente l’età del Rè con il ualoroso\r\nanimo suo, et con le prouisioni, che loroM^[ta] presumeuano di fare\r\npiù che à bastanza per trouarsi al sicuro in ogni accidente, potessero\r\nsuperare la peruersità de Ribaldi, et ogni altra difficultà.\r\n\r\nHora che dalli intollerabili Capitoli da questa ultima impia pace\r\napparisce tutto il contrario, ueggendosi come restano del tutto\r\noppressi i Cat^[ci] et gli Ugonotti tanto solleuati, che non si\r\npreuagliano in qualche parte: mà che mettano necessità, et in loro\r\nsoggettione il Rè medesimo.\r\n\r\nNon può ne deue sua Beatitudine mancare di tutti quei Uffity, che\r\nsi appartengono al grado suo per aprire la mente del Rè con modo,\r\nche sia cauato dalle tenebre, oue altri cerca di tenerlo, et sia\r\nilluminato delle prouisioni, che Sua M^[ta] può porgere per la salute,\r\net conseruatione dello Stato, et uita di tutti i buoni, che senza\r\npronto, et potente rimedio se ne andranno in perditione, non potendo\r\nmai reggersi quel Regno senza buona giustistia, et religione; le\r\nquali sono corrottissime con l’Intervento delli Heretici in esse,\r\nli quali Heretici non accade dubitare, che hanno sempre hauuta, et\r\nhanno tutavia più che mai la principale mira loro fissa alla rouina\r\ndel Rè et uaglionsi apparentemente di quelle due cose, che sono\r\ngeneralissime per chiunque cerca di distruggere un Dominio, ò una\r\nMonarchia, cioè la prima di mettere in diffidenza à chi lo regge quei\r\nPrencipi massimamente, che lo possono sostenere, et porgere consigli;\r\net aiuti da conseruarsi il suo debito imperiò, come si sà, che hanno\r\ntanto tempo procurato di conseguire più, et sopra ogni altra cosa li\r\nUgonotti del Rè di Spagna con dar ombra, et metter gelosia, che Sua\r\nM^[ta] Catt.^[ca] et suoi Ministri ancor d’auantaggio fussero sempre\r\nper procurare, non che desiderare la divisione della Francia; perchè\r\nla bassezza del Rè Christianissimo, redondaua à grandezza del l’altro\r\ninterpretando perpetuamente, et le parole, et i fatti, che ueniuano da\r\nquella parte al peggior senso, il quale argomento, sebene in superficie\r\nhauesse del propabile in qualche parte, nondimeno la natura del Rè\r\nCat.^[co] tanto inclinata al bene, et alla quiete, fà conoscere a pieno\r\nil contrario, come dimostra pur troppo chiaramente l’occasione, che ha\r\nlassato passare, con il non havere con effetto animo di nuocere alla\r\nFrancia per pensiero di accrescere se stesso; Ma è assai alli Ugonotti\r\ndi hauere messo Zizania da ogni parte, tanto che l’uno non si fidi\r\ndell’ altro, sicome hanno cerco, che gli riesca di consequire del Papa,\r\nsebene non è uenuto loro fatta, perche Sua Beat.^[ne] per sua troppa\r\nbontà pospone ogni altra occasione, hauendo risguardo solo al seruitio\r\ndi Dio, et al bene di quella Corona et del Rè.\r\n\r\nL’altra seconda cosa è di mettere diuisione nel Popolo, che di ciò\r\nnon accade produrne ragioni, ueggendosi pur troppo per gl’ istessi\r\ncapitoli dell’ accordo. E necessaria adunque inanzi ad ogni altra cosa\r\ndi provare con buone ragioni, come la setta delli Ugonotti con li suoi\r\ncapi, sono sforzati a tenere in perpetuo la persona del Rè per inimica\r\nimplacabile, perchè oltre à quello che è detto di sopra l’hanno troppo\r\ngrauemente offesa, nello Stato nell’ honore, et quanto ad essi nella\r\nuita sicome testifica quella giornata di Meos, nella quale fu forza a\r\nSua M^[ta] trottare sino a Parigi nel modo che è notorio.\r\n\r\nMolte altre congiure, et conspirationi fatte da essi contra la persona\r\ndi Sua M^[ta] et tanti trattati, et ribellioni usate per occuparle\r\nle sue Terre, sono palesi, et n’appariscono i processi fatti per le\r\nscritture, che furono trovate à Sciantiglione di Coligni, et che\r\noffende non perdona, onde considerata la natura loro, non resta\r\ndubbio, che come consij di havere macchinato contra alla uita del Suo\r\nSovrano Padrone, et offesolo nell’ honore, et nello Stato tante uolte\r\ncosì abbomineuolmente, come è nonsolo palese; ma prouato a chiunque\r\nlo uole sapere, non potranno in eterno essere fideli, nè obedienti\r\nVassalli; anzi non staranno mai quieti se non per fraude, et con\r\nintentione d’ingannare Sua M^[ta] quando uegghino le cose in termine,\r\nche li habbia da riuscire, et se gli mancarà il modo con l’ Armi\r\nscoperte, et con congiurationi palesi, come per lo passato; perchè\r\nla loro setta hauesse declinato, forse per il danno riceuuto nelle\r\nbattaglie, che Dio benedetto hà fatto loro perdere, ò perchè dubitino\r\ndi poter essere oppressi dal ualore, et uirtu, che uede essere nel Rè\r\nè non solo uerisimile, ma chiara, et sicura cosa, che procureranno\r\ndi aiutarsi per ogni uia etia indirettissima, et seguitaranno il lor\r\ncostume solito, et però non perdoneranno à ueleno, nè ad altra sorte\r\ndi scelerata uiolenza, come la morte del Marescial di Bordiglione,\r\nquella di Monsig^[r] di Ghisa, et infinite altre simili ci ammaestrano,\r\nperchè conosceranno, come niuna uia è più certa di assicurarli ad ogni\r\nmisfatto, et insieme da conseguire il fine del colorire i loro peruersi\r\ndissegni; onde si può fare uera conseguenza, che niuna persona fidele\r\nal Rè, et prudente possa, ne debba persuadere Sua M^[ta] a disarmare,\r\nò à fidarsi in alcun modo poco, ne molto delli ribelli di Christo, et\r\nsuoi.\r\n\r\nHè che intenda d’huer concordato con essi altrimenti, che con\r\nl’intentione, che hebbe già il Rè Luigi XI. il quale considerata\r\nl’unione de Grandi contra di se uolse rendersi facile di promettere\r\nogni condittione, benchè iniqua, che da ciascuno l’ era chiesta, mà\r\ndissipati che hebbe i capi della ribellione, come furono deposte l’\r\narmi, incontinente gli troncò tutti, senza indugio, ne risguardo\r\nalcuno. Anzi hà da guardarsi Sua M^[ta] ben diligentemente da tutti\r\ncoloro i quali con si gran carità gridano pacis bona, et abusando della\r\nclemenza, et benignità del Rè, si sforzano d’ingannarlo, commendando\r\nquesta pace particolare con le lode della pace in genere; perchè con le\r\nsue proprie non lo potriano fare: Chi non sà che la pace per se stessa\r\nè buona? Mà chi non sa ancora che Sicary, i Venefici, gli Assassini\r\ngli Assassinatori, gli Incendiarij, i Sacrilegij, gli Heretici, et gli\r\nhuomini senza fede, ne honore meritano punitione, et esterminatione.\r\nChi non sà similmente, che hauer preso per trattata la Roccella per\r\nforza Angolem, et tante, et tante altre Città, et Terre in tutti i\r\nmodi, che l’ hauere assediato il suo Rè, che l’abbruciare le Chiese,\r\ndar il guasto alle Prouincie, et distruggere, et esterminare, ò\r\nribellare i Popoli è cattiva cosa, et peccato irremediabile. Mà che\r\nil liberarsi da si graue indignità, et oppressioni, et che il cauar\r\nlo Stato suo, et suoi buoni Vassalli, et se stesso da tale calamità,\r\net miserie, come è la uile, et abbietta seruitù di chiunque si troua\r\nsottoposto alle crudeli Tirannide, et rapina de’ capi delli Ugonotti,\r\nnon è esser seuero, et rigido, mà à fare il douere, il dritto, et\r\nquelche ricerca la Giustitia; Come può il Rè uolgere gli occhi pieni di\r\nquel generoso spirito che hanno mostro i suoi antecessori in tante et\r\nsi grande Imprese, da i quali ha riceuuto il titolo di Christianissimo,\r\nacquistato d’essi per i loro meriti verso la Roccella, et tutto il\r\nPaese, che chiamano di conquista, et tolerare di uederselo tolto con\r\ni Popoli ribellati, et in tutto alienati dalla sua obedienza, et\r\nReligione con le Chiese antichissime, et si eccellenti, et nobili\r\nedifitij tutte demolite, la qual cosa auuiene non solo ne Paesi doue\r\nhanno pensato d’annidarsi, ma da tutte le parti del Regno, douunque\r\nsono passati con l’armi, che se ne uederanno i uestigii per li secoli\r\nauuenire, nonchè per li successori nostri, talmente hanno adoperato il\r\nferro, et il foco contro la fede di Christo, et la giurisdittione, et\r\nl’autorità Regia.\r\n\r\nSi che quando per qualsiuogla mondana ragione pur uolesse Sua M^[ta]\r\nscordarsi l’offese si graui fatte alla Corona, à sè, et all’honore,\r\net dignità sua, non può, ne deue posponere quelle, che sono commesse\r\ncontra Christo, et alla sua legge, et non può mancare di giustitia\r\nalli suoi Popoli fideli, et Cat.^[ci] che chieggono pietà, et gridano\r\nuendetta, chiari di non douere, nè poter, ne uoler havere mai pace, nè\r\ntriegua à modo alcuno, sapendo di non potersi mai fidare d’essi, come\r\nl’esperienza gli ha dimostro molte uolte a troppo loro gran costo. Però\r\nquando uedessero di essere abbandonati, et derelitti dal Rè, et dal\r\nGouerno, piutosto che restare a descrittione di gente si scelerata per\r\nfuggire la rapacita, et enormissime crudeltà loro saranno forzati di\r\nricorrere ad ogni ultimo refugio.\r\n\r\nSi può dunque proporre in consideratione al Rè qual sia più pietoso\r\nuffitio, quanto a Dio, et più glorioso quanto al mondo, hauer fatto\r\nun accordo con l’inique, et intollerabili condittioni, che si ueggano\r\ncon Vassalli, et ribelli reintegrandoli nè beni, et dignità, gradi\r\npreminentie, uffitij, et benefitij, cedendoli parte dello Stato\r\nproprio, con il lassar loro delle principali Fortezze del suo Regno\r\nin diverse Prouincie, pagandoli danari di nuouo, oltre all’assoluerli\r\ndi quanto hanno rubbato alla Corona, et al Popolo, et quello che\r\nimporta più di tutto il resto, permetterli il libero esercitio delle\r\nloro Heresie, o l’hauere liberato i suoi fideli soggetti, et se la\r\nCasa Sua, et il suo Regno, et la Christianità, da si pestifera et\r\nperniciosa Canaglia, Bella usanza certo si potrebbe chiamare l’usurpare\r\ncon la Tirannia, che s’hanno fatto gli Ugonotti, le Città et gli Stati\r\npertinenti alla Corona, saccheggiare et espilare tutte le Prouincie,\r\ndoue si sono potuti cacciare con ogni sorte di tradimento, et quando\r\nnon si hà havuto altro refugio, ricorrere alla pace, et al perdono\r\nper non restituire quello che si è rubbato, et occupato à forza, et\r\nTirannicamente. Tollerassi, che uno, ò pochi transfugi, infame, si\r\nfacciano capi di una setta, et senza cagione, ò ragione pur finta,\r\nò apparente; non chè con autorità, et giusto titolo, sotto colore di\r\nuolersi fare riformatori dé Preti diformati, et disobedienti, pigliano\r\nl’ armi contra il Rè, lo minacciano, faccino le battaglie seco, lo\r\nmettino nelle necessità, doue Sua M^[ta], è stata, et si truoua\r\ntuttauia, et li diano le leggi piutosto, che castigare chi lo merita,\r\net reintegrare la giustitia, et la Religione nel suo Dominio, senza le\r\nquali due cose mai si uisse, nè si potrà uiuere rettamente in alcun\r\nluogo.\r\n\r\nAnzi è troppo chiara cosa, come questo male non corretto: mà così\r\ntrasandato andarà augumentando si ogni giorno maggiormente di sorte,\r\nche si habbia da mutare Imperio, come si uede che desiderano, et\r\nprocurano con ogni diligenza gli Ugonotti che segua. E adunque la\r\npace, cosi fatta pericolosa, et dannosa, come si è dimostro, sicome al\r\npunir li malfattori sarà sempre trouato necessario, honesto, et utile.\r\nBisogna hora poi considerare, posto, che si debba fare se il Rè hà il\r\nmodo da reintegrarsi nel suo prestino Stato, et autorità, et obedienza,\r\net di ciò forse si potrebbe uenire in certa cognitione col misurare\r\nqual sia più il numero de Cat^[ci] ò quello degli Ugonotti, qual siano\r\nmaggiori, et più gagliarde le forze, et armi de ribelli, ò quelle del\r\nRè, quale delle due parti habbia più facile il modo da cauare gente\r\nforastiera, et sia meglio appoggiata d’amicitie de Prencipi Potentati,\r\net de danari.\r\n\r\nEt in fine secondo tali propositioni farne la conseguentia, per\r\ndue Ugonotti, che siano nel Regno, si ode calcolare, che si ha da\r\ncontraporre più di otto Cat.^[ci] gli ribelli hanno perduto nelle\r\nbattaglie oltre alla reputatione, et la quantità degli huomini molti\r\nCapi grandi, che haueuano come il Prencipe di Condè, Dandalotto, et\r\ntanti altri, talmente che non accade far paragone dell’ armi sue a\r\nquelle del Rè, essi sono senza denari, et non possono così a loro posta\r\npiù cauare nuoui soccorsi d’Alemagna, et Sua M^[ta] ne ha da sborsare\r\nad essi a millione, et può hauer Reistri, Suizzari, Italiani, et\r\nSpagnuoli quanto li piace, et purchè uolesse sarebbe aiutato da tutta\r\nla Christianità, et quello che importa non meno di tutto il Resto, ha\r\nad arbitrio, et disposition sua la giustitia, con la quale sola non è\r\ndubbio, che sarebbe bastante de regolare il tutto.\r\n\r\nSono accettate queste ragioni perchè non si può negare, Ma si risponde,\r\nche la Nobiltà di Francia, che è quella dalla quale depende il Popolo,\r\ntotalmente è corrotta per la maggior parte, et da questo procede\r\ntutto il male, che la grandezza del Rè proprio in ogni tempo è stata\r\nprincipalmente per il seguito, et obedienza de i Nobili, et mancandogli\r\nessi Sua M^[ta] resterebbe debolissima, et allegano le battaglie\r\nguadagnate per diuina dispositione, che non si sono poi proseguite,\r\nnè cauatone quel frutto, che si speraua, et douenasi. Onde si uà\r\nimprimendo nell’ animo di Sua M^[ta] che per quel verso mai si potrà\r\nuedere il fine, et che però manco mal sia essere ricorso all’ accordo\r\nin quei modi, che si è potuto, perchè il tempo farà ben lui. Le quali\r\nfallacie sono troppo palpabili, toccandosi con mano, et uedendosi con\r\nl’occhio chiaramente doue stà la magagna: percioche il Re uorrà recarsi\r\nla mente al petto, e redursi a memoria delle cagioni, perchè non fù\r\nseguitata la Vittoria dopo la battaglia di San Dionigi, et perchè si\r\ndiede tempo tante, et tante settimane alli Ribelli di riunirsi, et\r\nstabilirsi nelloro capo, et non si uolse mai obedire d’andare a cauarli\r\nda Monteri, o Faulnona, come sa chiunque si trouò, che si poteua\r\nfare senza alcun pericolo, et perchè a Craton in Campagna, quando si\r\nseguitauano li Ribelli non si uolse combatterli, nè manco andarli\r\nappresso da uicino, ò tagliargli i passi, come è palese, che si poteua\r\nper non impedirgli la congiuntione con il soccorso, che ueniua loro di\r\nGermania, conoscerà manifestamente Sua M^[ta] di essere stata tradita,\r\net sa da chi, et lo proua da far punire i malfattori per giustitia,\r\nma non è stata consigliata da uenirne mai all’ esecutione, perchè Sua\r\nM^[ta] non hà uoluto consigliarsi con altri, che con coloro che la\r\ntradiscono. Veggasi quel che seguì poi con l’altra pace fatta con mira,\r\net intentione di dare la stretta alii capi di quella maledetta setta,\r\ndopo che hauessero deposte l’ armi, et reso le Fortezze; acciochè con\r\ntal mezo si conseguisca l’ intento, che si deue hauere senza tanto\r\nsangue per non debilitare le forze proprie. Ma i traditori, che dauano\r\nil Consiglio, o almeno erano partecipi di esso, seppero guidare le cose\r\nin modo, et si lasciò uscire la uolpe dalla tana, et portò il caso,\r\nche appunto quelli di cui altri si fidaua più, et che haueua l’ordine\r\ndi fare l’ essecutione, auuertissero si a tempo i Ribelli, che furono\r\ni primi a repigliare l’ armi, et uscirne di Noyrs, et conseruaronsi la\r\nRoccella, et hebbero in ordine di poter pigliare Angoslen per forza,\r\nprima che le forze del Re fossero unite esse da opponesseli, che anco\r\nquesto, come il resto uiene procedette tutto dalli traditori tiranti\r\nadrieto le prouisioni Regie per dar tempo a complici di lauorare,\r\nPiacque pur poi a Dio, che miracolosamente fosse ammazzato, il Prencipe\r\ndi Condè, et disfatto parte delle genti di Moners, ma non si seguitò,\r\ncome si poteua doueua, et conueniuasi. Venne ancora il Duco di\r\nDupponti, che si poteua combatterlo, et uincerlo al sicuro, et non si\r\nfece per le cagioni, che si seppero, et pure non ci si prouidde.\r\n\r\nFu seguitato, et verso Limoges si hebbero diuerse occasioni di romperlo\r\nsenza alcun risico, et non fù esseguito per la colpa di chi n’ impediua\r\nla essecutione con l’autorità, che haueua nell’ essercito Regio;\r\naccioche si lasciasse se unire col Coligni, anzi fù procurato con buona\r\ncura di guardare l’ Essercito Regio in forma, et in siti, che la fame,\r\net gli stenti l’ hauessero a fare sbandare, dando andito, commodità, et\r\naiuto à ribelli di godere il Paese, et d’impatronirsi de’ magazzeni,\r\nde uittouaglie munitioni, et artigliarie preparate da alcune persone,\r\nche si era troppo apparentemente ueduto, che erano colpeuoli, in ciò\r\nsi uenne al paragone, come questi tali scellerati traditori erano di\r\npiù autorità, essi appresso le loro Maestà, che qualunque recordaua\r\nla salute, et il seruitio di esse, come riusci similmente quando si\r\nera fatta deliberatione de Suizzeri, et Italiani, così all’ ingrosso,\r\nche il Re auesse facoltà di farsi la ragione con l’ armi à malgrado de\r\nFrancesi, che la seruiuano male, i quali misero sù Mons^[r] Duca d’Angiù\r\nche la impregnò, come cosa che offendesse la dignità, et honor proprio\r\ndi Sua Altezza, conoscendo chiaramente, che l’ intenteone de chi\r\ngouernaua, et consigliaua Sua M^[ta] non era uolta ad altro fine, che\r\nfargli inimici, ouero diffidenti tutti gli altri Prencipi, et in somma\r\npriuarlo di tutti gli aiuti esterni.\r\n\r\nLe difficoltà, che furono interposte, per consumar tempo nell’ andare\r\nal soccorso di Poiters, sono anco loro ben note, perchè ùhebbero\r\nda interuenire diuersi capi, che andarono con le genti Italiane,\r\nfinalmente, come Piacque a Dio seguì la battaglia di Moncontor, dopo\r\nla quale il Rè medesimo sa, come fù tenuto a bada sotto San Giouanni\r\nd’Angelin, nè si uolse mai mandare parte della Cauallaria, non che\r\ntutto l’Essercito dietro alli Ribelli rotti, et in fuga, di sorte che\r\nnon era possibile, che si riunissero, se non se gli fusse lasciato in\r\npreda le migliori, et più opulenti Prouincie di Francia per accrescere\r\nloro il seguito de Padroni, et lasciarli reinferscare, et rimettere\r\ninsieme. Dalle quali cose si ode, che il Rè medesimo hà scorto qualche\r\ncosa, che gli ha fatto nausea. Ma essendo Sua M^[ta] attorniata di\r\ngente, che lo cerca d’ingannare, et tradire per ogni uerso, ella\r\nnon può discernere i Lacci, che gli sono tesi ne i pericoli doue si\r\ntroua, però e da cercare di far la molto ben capace delle sopradette\r\ncose, mostrandoli, che es non si lieua da torno quei ribaldi, che\r\ncercauano così grandi artificij di rouinarla, ella si prouocherà l’\r\nira di Dio, ne douerà più sperare nella sua diuina misericordia, che\r\ncosì miracolosamente l’ ha sostenuto, et protetto fino al presente,\r\nma restarà in preda di coloro, che non hanno altra mira, che di fare\r\nandare in precipitio la Sua Corona.\r\n\r\nDi sopra e fatto mentione di alcuni particolari dè più sostantiali,\r\naccioche accadendosi si sappiano addurre per essempio al Rè, alla\r\npersona del quale pare, che si debba far capo direttamente, et parlare\r\na Sua M^[ta] senza maschera, perchè certo non se gli può far maggior\r\nbenefitio, che id storarli le orecchie, et aprirgli occhi, et la mente\r\nper farli bene intendere liberamente, come non resta, che da lei\r\nmedesima, se non uorrà porre rimedio a tanti mali, à quali tutti può\r\nprouedere facilmente, con punire quelli, che nominatamente si daranno\r\nin una lista, et degli altri, che gli paia, che lo meritino, secondo\r\nil riscontro, che trouarà su le scritture cauate da Casa Coligni, et\r\nancora, che alli ribelli di Christo, et suoi, che hanno fatto tutte, et\r\nsi grandi, et inaudite sceleratezze, secondo l’ opinione di alcuni, non\r\naccade considerare di guardar Fede ò promessa fatta, nondimeno si può\r\nfare di castigare solo quelli, che hanno tradito, mentre seruiuano nel\r\ncampo, ò nel Consiglio regio, che fia senza alcun dubio a bastanza.\r\n\r\nHassi d’ auuertire ancora il Rè, come fin che Sua M^[ta] se n’ è ita\r\npresso alle grida, et è stata con effetti del tutto Ingannata, ella può\r\nesser scusata appresso Dio, et al Mondo, ma dopo che saranno scoperte\r\nle magagne, et rappresentatole la uerità, et il modo di non star più\r\nin preda, et alla descrittione de’ traditori se non ci può: uederà la\r\ncolpa di tutti i male, si ridurranno sopra le sue spalle, et restarà\r\nabbandonata da Sua Diuina M^[ta] appresso della quale più non uarranno\r\ni prieghi, et oratione del Papa, et de gli buoni, et fedeli, che forse\r\nhanno giouato più di ogni altro aiuto humano a sostenerla. Vedesi, che\r\ngli Heredi uanno cercando sottilmente a qualunque occasione di fare che\r\nil Rè offenda Dio per prouocargli il suo giusto sdegno, mettendogli\r\ninanzi con la sua pelosa carità di conseruarsi l’ amicitia del Turco\r\ndi usurpare i beni Ecc^[ci]. et fino a mettersi a fare nuove Imprese\r\nfuora del Regno col mezo delle loro Armi, la qual ultima cosa non è\r\nincredibile in alcun mode se già il Re non uolesse darsi loro in preda\r\ndel tutto, perciochè quando quell’ armi si uoltassero contra qualunque\r\nsi sia stato di Prencipe Catholico Nostro Sig^[re] non potrebbe\r\nmancare di far quanto si appartiene al debito dell’ offitio suo, senza\r\nrisguardo d’ altra mondana consideratione, trattandosi della gloria\r\ndi Dio, et conseruatione della Sua Santa Legge, nel qual caso Sua\r\nBeatitudine sarebbe forzata di procurare con la medesima caldezza di\r\nsouuenire, et aiutare altri contra gli Heretici, che ha fatto con il Rè\r\nCat^[co]. et con Venettiani, la qual Lega si hà da ricercare, che sia\r\nuolta contra gli Heretici, et Infedeli, piutosto, che altroue.\r\n\r\nSopra la competenza, et gara de grandi, si possono dir moltj\r\nparticolari in uoie, che sarià troppo lunga cosa mettere in scrittura,\r\nbasta, che tutto seruono a negare la debita obedienza al Padrone, et\r\nal uoler portar l’ armi con le quali s’ impedisce la giustitia, et\r\nfino a tanto che il Re non punisce a qualche uno de buoni, che lo\r\nmeriti, perchè altri non preuarichi poi in modo, che una parte, et l’\r\naltre si chiarisca per effetto, come Sua M^[ta] uuole conseruarsi la\r\nsuperiorità, che se gli conuiene, mai sarà libera da queste molestie,\r\net sempre si starà in preda di ogni uno.\r\n\r\nE. uerisimile, che la Reina ami più di tutti gli altri lo Stato, et la\r\nuita del Re et l’ unione, et conseruatione de gli altri suoi Figliuoli,\r\nessendo essa prudente quanto si sa, et hauendo tanta cognitione delli\r\nhumori, quanta le ha fatta imparare la lunga amministratione del\r\nGouerno, che ella ha hauuto, però non si può dubitare, che Sua M^[ta]\r\nper ambitione di conseruarsi l’ autorità preuarichi in parte alcuna di\r\nquel che deue, ma la proua ci ammonisce troppo, che da lei non si può\r\naspettare quelle esecutioni, che ha mostro al Duca d’Alua in Fiandra,\r\nche basta a stabilire le solleuationi, et ribellione, perchè il sesso\r\nnon gli lo promette, et anco in uerità di essere scusata, essendo stata\r\nForastiera, et senza appoggio di potersi reggere secondo lei in simili\r\ncasi, bisognando delle cotai deliberationi persona di gran cuore, et\r\nche habbia oltre l’ autorità l’ attitudine di fare con le mani proprie,\r\nquando l’ occasioni lo ricerchi, però con la M^[ta] della Reina, non\r\npare che accada pensare di poter profittare per tal uerso, si che il\r\ntrattarne con essa non si deue hauere per opportuno, et anco di questo\r\nsi potrebbe pigliar Conseglio sul luogo per gouernarsene secondo che\r\ngiudicassero meglio quelli che si sà, che sono buoni, et ueri Cat^[ci]\r\net che non hanno più mira alle passioni particolari per il desiderio\r\ndi hauer maggior partecipatione nel Gouerno, che al seruitio, et ben\r\npublico.\r\n\r\nIntorno alle quali cose è ben necessario, che chi sarà impiegato\r\nhabbia molta prattica, et gran prudenza da saper usare la descrittione\r\nessendoci bisogno di somma consideratone, percioche quando si trouasse\r\ntanto in preda a chi gl’ Inganna, che altri si disperasse di poter\r\nilluminarlo, et che si restasse ben chiaro di non douer cauar Frutto\r\ndalla persona di Sua M^[ta] sarebbe da uoltarsi forse ad altra strada,\r\ncioè uerso quei Prencipi, et grandi, che si conseruano Catholici, et\r\nche restano essosi et esclusi dal Re, et dal gouerno, et priui di\r\nautorità, et reputatione, i quali se haueranno un capo dependente dal\r\nPapa del quale sappino di potersi fidare, sono atti a uolersene, et\r\ncon il mezo della sua autorità far tale unione d’ arme di Cat^[ci]\r\nin quel Regno, che il Re sia forzato a riconoscersi del suo errore,\r\nperchè la maggior parte delle Prouincie di quel Regno sono sotto il\r\ngouerno de Prencipe, o Sig^[re] Cat^[co]. ciascuno de quali saprà, et\r\npotrà ridurre le associationi, che furono incominciate con i loro Capi\r\nminori, et mediocri, et supremi da ualersi dell’ arme, nel modo stesso,\r\nche hanno sempre usato gli Ugonotti, et con esse dare adosso a gli\r\nUgonotti da ogni parte per estinguerne la prima razza, che anco sopra\r\nciò in uoce si può esprimere uarie cose, le quali sarebbono noiose a\r\nmettere in scritto, et a tal proposito si può ridarre a memoria quello\r\nche loro M^[ta] mandarono ad offerire al Papa per sicurtà della loro\r\nrissolutione di non uolere mancare subbito, che potessero liberare quel\r\nRegno dalla Heresia, cioè di capitulare espressamente, che a detti\r\nGouernatori delle Prouincie se le usurpassero in caso di tal mancamento.\r\n\r\nL’ abbandonare questa causa non è secondo la bontà, et pietà di\r\nNostro Sig^[re] nè a ragion di Stato conciosiache non si prouedendo\r\nè da dubitare, et da tener per certo, che gli Ugonotti anderanno\r\nsependo, et cercando d’ impatronirsi se gli riuscisse à fatto del\r\nRegno per procedere poi anco più oltre con imprese esterne, et forse\r\nhanno dissegno col mettere su il Re a nuoue Imprese di conseguir l’\r\nuna, et l’ altra Impresa in un medesimo tempo col far morire il Re,\r\net li Fratelli, et altri grandi, che potessero per uia di congiure,\r\net di tradimenti preualersi dell’ entrata della Corona, et del Clero\r\na sostenere solo l’ Imprese cominciate in compagnia del Re, la qual\r\nconsideratione, sebene paresse lontana non è da gettarsi dopo lè\r\nspalle; anzi è consentaneo alla ragione di permeditarsi, et fare con la\r\nprudenza quei rimedy, che sono giudicati più conuenienti.\r\n\r\nFrà quali s’ intenda il mandare al Re, et alli Cat^[ci]. una persona\r\nsola, o due, una diretta a Sua M^[ta]. et l’ altra alli Cat^[ci]. che\r\nsi riferisca, et obedisca al principale.\r\n\r\nForse non sarebbe inconueniente di mandare anco uerso il Re Cat^[co].\r\npersona ben confidente, et sincera et rissoluta, che potesse cauare Sua\r\nM^[ta] Cat^[ca]. de Generali, parlandogli con buona intelligenza delli\r\nhumori prefati di Francia, et mostrandogli quanto sia il pericolo,\r\nche portano gli Stati di Fiandra, si perchè con il tempo diuentando\r\nHeretica la Francia, quelli Stati infetti di già non si potranno a\r\nmodo alcuno conseruare da Sua M^[ta]. Cat^[ca] quali remedij ella\r\npresume di farci, et sapere, accioche si potesse disponere, et pensare\r\nse con i Vinetiani et altri Prencipi si potesse fare simili offitij per\r\ntastarli il polso douendo essi presumere, che sempre, che fusse mosso\r\nguerra alli Stati del Re di Spagna a loro non rincrescesse di potersi\r\naiutare della Lega fatta, ma necessario, non che opportuno, in ogni\r\ncaso pare il far prouisione quà de danari, de quali Sua Beat^[ne]. ha\r\na ualersi grossamente, si per aiutare quelle cose, come per diffondere\r\nItalia, et il resto della Christianità dalle forze di questa scelerata\r\nsetta. Et perchè le deliberationi di tanta importanza, nella quale si\r\ntratta della salute del Regno, et della conseruatione della Santa Sede,\r\net della Christianità si hanno da fare con matura consideratione, si\r\npotrebbe per auentura discernere meglio qual partito fosse da pigliare\r\nprima, o poi, et come, et fino a qual termine udendone il parere di\r\nquelle persone, che paressero, et fussero giudicate intelligenti, et\r\nconfidenti. Quanto alle richieste fatte adesso dal Re, la risposta\r\nfatta da N^[ro] Sig^[re] sopra la dispensa del Duca di Ghisa, et\r\ndella Prencipessa di Portiano, non può essere più giusta, ma è facile\r\na temperarla col mandare la dispensa del tutto spedita per chi\r\nandasse, accioche si uaglia di darla, o non appalesarla, secondo, che\r\ntrouerà, che sia più a proposito per li humori; Conciosiache se si\r\nconclude affatto il Matrimonio di Portogallo, come è da stimare, che\r\nsia il disegno, chi sa che Madama Margherita non diuentasse moglie\r\ndel Duca di Ghisa, piutosto che del Prencipe di Nauarra. Et circa\r\nil permettere che gli Ugonotti possino habitare sicuramente nella\r\nCittà, et Contado di Auignone, non parche accada stare in dubbio, che\r\nSua Santità, non lo può, ne deue concedere, ma di restituire i loro\r\nbeni, et lasciarli contrattare, perchè ne sgombrano, si può ben forse\r\nhauerci consideratione, se con questa gratia fatta al Re si uedesse di\r\naccomodare con Sua M^[ta] qualche una delle cose più sostantiali, et\r\nanco ciò pare, che bisogni rimettere alla descrittone, et prudenza di\r\nchi si uolesse mandare, il quale deue hauere per massima, che sempre,\r\nche il Re uoglia essere così impio, che si risolua di fare quello,\r\nche può per leuare al Papa, et alla Santa Sede quello Stato, non ci è\r\nrimedio a diffendersi, ne essendo Auignone troppo circondato dalle sue\r\nforze, però conuiene auitarsi di conseruarselo, come si è fatto per l’\r\nadietro in tutti i tempi con l’ autorità, et beneuolenza, et fauore\r\ndel Re, al quale se può rimostrare che N^[ro] Sig^[re]. non uuole,\r\nne intende tenere con l’ armi perturbato il suo Regno, mà solo tanta\r\nguardia nella Città, et Terre, che ui sono, che basti a non lasciarle\r\nrubbare per tradimento a quattro di quei scalzi Ugonotti, come ne sono\r\nstate tolte tante a Sua M^[ta].\r\n\r\nDouendo questa scrittura seruire solo per informatione delli humori di\r\nquel Regno, non pare, che accade farla ordinata, ne limitata, però sarà\r\nfatta, come si è potuto all’ imprescia &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XIV\r\n\r\n[P. 354, n. 1]\r\n\r\nSTATE PAPERS, FOREIGN\r\n\r\nELIZABETH, VOL.

Seigneurs Princes n’est et ne fut\r\nonques d’oster au Roy sa couronne comme ilz ont esté calumniez, mais\r\nd’entretenir le vray pur et libre service de Dieu, come le Roy suyvant\r\nla req^[te] des estatz la accordé a tous ses subgectz.\r\n\r\nNous sommes persuadez de la bonne affection que sa Ma^[te] a portee a\r\nla Roine de Navarre et a Messieurs les Princes au paravant que ceulx\r\nqui aujourdhuy soubz le nom du Roy oppriment le Royaulme eussent\r\nchassé d’aupres de sa personne tous ses meilleurs et plus loyaux\r\nconseillers et mesmes qu’au paravant ces dernieres troubles nonobstant\r\nles fausses accusations calumnies et impostures dont on avoit charge\r\nlad.

Et quant a aymer la noblesse il est certain\r\nque ce sont ceulx qui la haissent et craignent le plus et apres eux\r\nles gens de lettres comme ceulx qui naturellement sont ennemys de la\r\ntyrannie, et de lusurpation quilz ont voulu faire de la couronne et en\r\nparticulier des comtez d’Aniou et de Provence, et que ne promections\r\njamais lalienation de la souveraincté de Bar, que ceulx de Guise ont\r\nessaie de praticquer depuis la mort du Roy Henry plus^[rs] fois et on\r\nscait encores ce quilz ont faict dernierement. Et quant au repos public\r\nil est certain que la paix et le Cardinal de Lorraine ne peuvent loger\r\nen ung mesme royaulme.\r\n\r\n Premierement que la memoire de toutes choses passées demeurera\r\n esteincte & supprimée comme de choses non jamais advenues. Quil ne\r\n sera loizible ne permis en quelque temps ne pour quelque occasion\r\n que ce soit den faire jamais mention ne procés en quelque court\r\n jurisdiction que ce soit ne ailleurs, et a ceste fin sera imposé\r\n silence a ses procureurs generaulx en toutes ses courtz de parlemens &\r\n leurs substitudz, sera aussy defendu a toutes personnes princes d’en\r\n renouveller la memoire ny en faire reproche sur peine destre puniz\r\n comme infracteurs de paix & perturbateurs du repos public.\r\n\r\nSemblables choses nous ont este promises deux foix mais les courtz de\r\nparlemens et autres juges inférieures n’ont laisse de faire mourir\r\nceulx quilz ont peu apprehender, le peuple a massacre par tout ou ils\r\na esté le plus fort, les assassinats ont este tous publics, de justice\r\nils ny en a point eu les injures plus grandes que jamais ce mot de\r\nrebelle a este familier en la bouche des Gouverneurs des Provinces et\r\nsingulierement des soubz Gouverneurs dont la France est infectée, et\r\nconsequemment des pctis, partant pour effectuer ceste promesse est de\r\nbesoing que sa Ma^[te] pourveoie a la justice et a son prive conseil\r\ncomme elle seulle le peult et doibt faire autrement ces promesses sont\r\ntrappes et pieges.\r\n\r\n Que tous arrestz sentences jugemens & procedures faictes en quelque\r\n Court et devant quelques juges que ce soit durant les presens troubles\r\n & aux precedens pour raison des choses passees durant ou a cause\r\n desditz troubles a lencontre des dessusditz ou aucuns deceulx seront\r\n mis a neant cassez & revoquez.\r\n\r\nIl nest rien si naturel que tous affaires soyent dissoutes par le moyen\r\nquel les ont este assemblees et partant est de besoing que les courtz\r\nqui ont faict la playe facent la guarison donnans arrestz et sentences\r\ncontraires a leurs premiers arrestz et sentences, aillent en personne\r\ndespendre les effigiez et ossemens des executez ou en effigie ou apres\r\nleur mort pour le moins en semblable sollemnité quilz les ont executez\r\ncomme il fut faict a Rouen en la personne des seigneurs de Harcourt\r\net de Granville. Et quant a ceulx qui ont este executez de faict que\r\npunition exemplaire soit faicte des Iuges qui ont este autheurs de\r\ntelles sentences mesmes contre le vouloir et intention du Roy et que\r\nles heritiers des defunctz prennent leurs interestz sur les biens desd.\r\ncriminelz.\r\n\r\n Quilz ou aucuns d’eulx ne pourront jamais estre recerchez pour raison\r\n des praticques ou intelligences quilz pourront auoir eves avec Princes\r\n Potentatz Communautez ou personnes privees estrangeres ny a cause des\r\n traictez ou contractz quilz pourraient avoir faictz ou passez avec\r\n eulx pour raison des choses concernans lesdictz troubles & dependances\r\n diceulx dont le Roy les a entierement deschargez et leur en baillera\r\n toutes tres & seuretez qui seront a ceste fin necessaires en la\r\n meilleure & plus autentique forme que faire se pourra.\r\n\r\nCe seroit a ceulx de Guise a prendre lettres d’abolition pour avoir eu\r\nsecrettes praticques avec les antiens ennemys de la couronne, les avoir\r\nmis dedans le Royaulme pour parvenir a leur damnable desseing dusurper\r\nle Royaulme et au contraire ceulx qui en une extreme necessité ont eu\r\nrecours a leurs antiens amys et confederez pour secouer ce joug et\r\nmainitenir le Roy et la Couronne meritent toutes sortes de louanges et\r\nde recognoissance pour leur grande valleur & pour tant de pertes.\r\n\r\n Que par le benefice de ceste paix tous les dessusditz seront remis &\r\n reintegrez en leurs honneurs & biens pour diceulx jouir eulx leurs\r\n enfans heritiers successeurs ou ayans cause paisiblement et sans aucun\r\n empeschement.\r\n\r\nCest article ne peult avoir lieu si ce que est dict cy dessus sur\r\nlar^[cle] 3 nest execute. Item puis que ceulx qui ont tué de sang froid\r\nMonseigneur le Prince de Condé et contre la loy de la guerre. Ceulx\r\nqui ont emprisonne Monsieur d’Andelot et ce trahistre qui a tué le s^[r]\r\nde Mouy ont este hault esleuez et renumirez Messieurs leurs enfans ne\r\npeuvent estre remis en leurs honneurs sinon que punition exemplaire\r\nsoit faicte de si pernicieux hommes de leurs complices & adherens que\r\nsi Dieu mesmes a desja faict la vangeance d’aucuns (comme il la faict)\r\nsi leur memoire nest condamne.\r\n\r\n Et pour gratifier particulierement lesditz Princes & ceulx de la\r\n noblesse qui auront estatz charges & pensions de sadite Ma^[te] le Roy\r\n les remectra en sesditz estatz charges et pensions pour en jouir ainsy\r\n comme dessus est dit.\r\n\r\nCest article ne tend qu’a diviser les grands davec les petis pour les\r\nopprimer les ungs apres les autres.\r\n\r\n Et quant au faict de la religion le Roy, leur permectra de demeurer\r\n & vivre paisiblement dedans son Royaulme en entiere liberté de leur\r\n conscience sans estre recerchez en leurs maisons ny les abstreindre a\r\n faire chose pour le regard de ladite religion contre leur volunté. Et\r\n encores pour plus grande seureté sadite Ma^[te] leur accordera deux\r\n villes lesquelles le s^[r] de Biron leur nommera, dedans lesquelles\r\n ilz pourront faire tout ce que bon leur semblera et quilz vouldront\r\n sans estre recerchez. Et neantmoins en chascune desdites villes sadite\r\n Ma^[te] aura ung Gentilhomme capable & ydoine pour avoir loeil a ce\r\n quil ne soit faict chose qui contrevienne a son auctorité & repos\r\n de son Royaulme et qui mainctienne ung chacun en paix et repos. Ne\r\n voulant sadite Ma^[te] quil y ayt au reste de tout son Roiaulme aucun\r\n ministre ne quil soit faict autre exercice de religion que de la\r\n sienne.\r\n\r\nDautant que cest ar^[cle] est le noud de la matière il est aussy\r\ncaptieux en toutes ses parties.\r\n\r\nPremièrement il est couché si a propos quon ne scavoit recueillir sil\r\ns’entend seulement des Princes et de la noblesse oubien generallement\r\nde tous. Et on scait comment on sest servy par cydevant de telles\r\nfacons de parler.\r\n\r\nSecondement il y a de la contradiction manifeste en ce quil est dict\r\nexpres, quil y aura entiere liberté de conscience et neantmoins quil ny\r\naura point de ministres en France.\r\n\r\nTiercement de limpossibilité, car quelle peut estre la liberté de la\r\nconscience ou il n’y a point dexercice de religion? Le Cardinal de\r\nLorraine pense que liberte de conscience et stupidite de conscience\r\nsoit ung. Or la liberte de conscience est en la liberté de la foy qui\r\nest en Christ comment se peut engendrer entretenir et augmenter la foy\r\nque par la parolle delaquelle estans privez il ne reste aucune liberté.\r\nLe Cardinal se trompe en ce quil pense que la liberté gise a avoir\r\ncongé de n’aller point a la Messe, de n’aller point aux pardons et\r\nchoses semblables, mais la liberte de la conscience ne gist point a ne\r\npoint faire ce qui est mauvais, mais a faire ce qui est bon. La verite\r\ndict qui oyt ma parolle et qui la mect en effect est bien heureux. Il\r\nsensuyt doncq que qui ne loyt point est malheureux Il ne dit point qui\r\nne va point a la Messe. En somme notre liberte nest point composee de\r\nnegatives, mais fondee sur propositions affirmatives quil fault faire.\r\nItem si le Cardinal ne peut comprendre quelle est ceste liberté des\r\nChrestiens, comme il ne peult ne luy ne quiconques soit en ce monde\r\nsil n’est regendre denhault, au moins peult il bien entendre que quand\r\nnous n’avons moyen de contracter mariages, baptizer les enfans, et\r\nenterrer noz mortz que nous n’avons aucune liberté en noz consciences,\r\nmainctenant quil me dise comment (ayans en horre^[r] les actes de la\r\npapauté) nous pouvons faire ces choses estans privez du ministere de la\r\nparolle de Dieu, et consequemment de pasteurs legitimes, mais il semble\r\nque nous sommes comme luy cest adire que la religion ne nous est que\r\njeu et que nous serions contentz que tous le monde vinst en Atheisme\r\ncomme il est certain que si cest ar^[cle] avoit lieu avant peu de\r\ntemps la France seroit pleine de Payens et en peu de temps il seroit\r\na craindre comme desja il est de trop, que ce mauvais conseil ne fust\r\ndommageable a ceulx qui l’ont donné et mesmes a tout lestat en general.\r\n\r\nQuartement, cest ar^[cle] est ung piege pour attrapper tous ceulx\r\nqu’on vouldra exposer a la mercy dung juge de village, car jusques on\r\nsestendra ceste liberté? Si ung homme prie soir et matin ou a quelque\r\nautre heure du jour, on dire quil aura faict acte de ministere comme\r\non trouvera desja assez de gens condamnez voire a la mort et executez\r\npour avoir prie Dieu, si on chante ung pseaume en sa maison ou en sa\r\nbouticque on en sera recerché car on dira comme il a esté desja souvent\r\njuge que cest autre exercice que de la religion du Roy cest adire de\r\nceulx qui sont prez de sa personne qui toutesfois nen ont point du\r\ntout.

Il Signor Dio la mantenga sana lungamente, con ogni contento et\r\nfelicita.\r\n\r\nPer le ultime lettere d’Italia ch’io trovai in Madrid, quali sono di\r\n17 de maggio, S. S^[tà] mi avvisa d’havere inteso che la Regina di\r\nFrancia sta in animo di far cancelliere di quel regno di Francia Mons^[r]\r\ndi Foys, hora Imbasciatore in Venetia. Et perche questo homo, oltre\r\nl’essere indiciato grandemente nel Santo Offitio de la Inquisitione\r\ndi Roma e parente e dependente da quella buona donna chiamata la\r\nRegina di Navarra, et è persona superba, inquieta di spirito, amica di\r\nnovita et discordia, et di piu si tiene offeso da Sua Santità per non\r\nhavere consentito ch’egli vadi a Roma, et credo il medesimo sia con V.\r\nM^[tà] por una causa simile di non haverlo accettato in Spagna; queste\r\ncause, dico, et altre che Sua Santita considera, gli da gran sospetto\r\nche, se questo homo fosse posto in tale administratione, la quale può\r\ninfinitamente in quel regno, come nel Cancellier passato s’è veduto per\r\nesperientia, non cercarebbe altro che di unire le voluntà de queste due\r\ndonne, et non solo, favorendo la parte ugonota, travagliare le cose di\r\nFrancia (pur troppo travagliate), ma anchora quelle de li circunvicini,\r\nmaxime nelli Stati ecclesiastici et di V. M^[tà] Cat.^[ca], non solo\r\nper vendetta de la offesa, et per l’odio che a l’uno et l’altro\r\nverisimilmente porta, ma anchora per la propria inclinatione sua. Onde\r\nSua Beatitudine, facendo sopra cio quello che puo per la sua parte,\r\ndesidera e ne prega V. M^[tà] a volere similmente cercare ogni via\r\ndi impedire tale elettione, et quando non si possi altro, si degni\r\nscrivere a l’Imbasciatore, et vedendo passar inanti tal cosa, si unisca\r\ncon il Nuntio, et insieme si lassino intendere apertamente dalla Regina\r\nche Sua Beatitudine et S. M^[tà] Cat^[ca] haveranno per male ch’ella\r\ndia uno orficio di tanta importantia in mano di persona tale il che\r\nnon deve fare, si ella desidera di essere tenuta fautrice de la fede\r\ncattolica desiderosa de la grandezza et quiete del Re suo figliuo lo\r\net della unione e^[t] bene de la Christianità. Spera Sua Santità che,\r\ncon questo rimedio si possi obviare a quello inconveniente, peroche la\r\nRegina prefata mostra pure di havere qualche consideratione in simili\r\nattioni di non far cosa che possi con ragione dispiacere a Sua Santità\r\net a V. M^[tà]. Et perche da una parte questo negotio ricerca presta\r\nprovisione, et da l’altra non è honesto che in questo tempo io dia\r\nperturbatione a V. M^[tà] con la mia presentia, ho voluto communicarla\r\ncon il Cardinale, et scrivere a V. M^[tà] Cat^[ca] la presente,\r\nsupplicandola humilmente si degni farmi dare quella grata risposta che\r\ncomandara ch’io scriva a Sua Beatitudine sopra questa materia. Et,\r\nbasando reverentemente le regali mani a V. M^[ta], prego N. S^[r]. Dio la\r\nconcervi longamente felice.\r\n\r\nDi Madrid, li 26 di Giugno 1570.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XXVII\r\n\r\n[P. 422, n. 1]\r\n\r\nSTATE PAPERS, FOREIGN\r\n\r\nELIZABETH, VOL. CXV, NO. 937.\r\n\r\n[_The Vidame de Charters to Marshal Montmorency_]\r\n\r\n\r\nMonseigneur, j’ay receu une lettre quil vous a pleu m’escripre pour\r\nresponce a ce que vous avois escript par monsieur de Saragosse. Iay\r\ncongneu que pensiez que je fusses encores au lieu dont vous avois\r\nescript. Si jeuse pense que ma presente y eust este requise j’euse\r\ndifferé tant quil vous eust pleu le me faire entendre. Mais il vous\r\nestoit fort aise a penser que si lon prenoit goust par deça a ceste\r\nnegociation elle seroit adressee a monsieur le cardinal de Chastillon,\r\nou a l’ambassadeur du roy. On seroit envoye quelqu’ng des francoys\r\nfavoris. Quand a moy ie n’ay pretendu en cest affaire que le service\r\ndu roy et de la couronne de France, et si les affaires succedoient\r\ncomme je y voy une telle espoirance et asseurance sil estoit poursuivy\r\ndiligemment. Le contentement que je desire ne me pouroit fuir. Il est\r\nvray que je serais fort marry si jamais j’oyois dire que par faulte de\r\ndiligence cest affaire fust demoure imparfaict, aussy seroit ce ung\r\ndomage public oultre le particullier du prince au quel les premiers\r\nfruicts en appartiennent. Monsieur une lettre que jay receue de mons^[r]\r\nde Saragosse me faict entrer en soupçon et craincte que en atendant\r\nentre deux personnes qui ne se sont jamais veues qui ostera prenner le\r\nbonnet il ne se mette quelqung entre deux qui face perdre l’occasion\r\nde contracter une grande amitie & fort utille a la France, la quelle\r\nestant perdue sensuyviroit le dommage et le regret (mais en vain). Je\r\nsuis bien asseure que larcheduc d’Austriche ne sendormira pas et ne\r\nlaisera perdre l’occassion qui se presente a une assemblee des estatz\r\nqui se vont tenyr voire les previendra sil peult ne perdra pas une\r\nheure, que pendant quil voyt que la royne est en deffiance et doubte\r\npour les affaires de la royne D’escosse et des differens quelle a avec\r\nle roy D’espaigne et quilz voyoient que l’empereur avent en pouppe,\r\net quil faict des mariages telz quil scavroit souhaiter. Il ne se\r\nserve de l’occassion & faveur du temps et pendant que les amis simulez\r\npaistront la jeunesse animeuse et la rempliront de grande espoirance,\r\nluy prometant par adventure des plus grandes choses (combien quelles\r\nne soient pas aysees a trouver), et pour moy je ne les scay pas ilz\r\nprendront cest advantage sur la partye et renforceront leur grandeur\r\nde la puissance et faveur d’un royaulme qui nest point petit. Et vous\r\nose bien dire quil y a de la part de ceux en qui gist la resolucion de\r\ncest affaire une grande inclinacion et une grande consideracion de long\r\nservice de cest ancyen serviteur et de la subjection et humiliacion\r\nquil a monstree de la quelle vous scavez que le sexe se delecte. Ausy\r\nest ce leur façon de regner la quelle toutes veulent exercer, tant plus\r\nles roynes. Il ne fault penser que les dificultes pour la religion\r\npuissent engendrer quelques difficultez aux capitulacions qui facent\r\nplus de retardement. Car je scay par la bouche de la dame et ausy par\r\nceux qui ont sceu toute ceste negotiacion passee, et par ung qui y a\r\neste employe qui ne parle pour metre le beau devers elle nestant de\r\nses subjects mais estranger, que la charte blanche luy a este donnee.\r\nEt sest contente l’Archeduc pour le faict de la religion de si peu\r\nque cella se doibt estimer pour rien. Davantage la consideracion de\r\nlage qui est plus vivill et meur donne ung beau lustre aux persuasions\r\net jugement de ceux qui tendent de ce costé la. Avec ses advantages\r\ndu long service et age convenable, je crains que ceux qui tiennent\r\nle party contraire ne persuadent avec aparence a cause du trop long\r\nsilence ou froide poursuite quil y aye du contemnement ou de la\r\nfroideur en ceux de la France estant chose propre au sexe de faire plus\r\nde choses par despit que par amour est a craindre quel la froideur de\r\nceste part ne soit cause de l’eschauffer et faire haster plus quelle\r\nne fairoit si nestoit pour se faire regretter apres a loisir par ceulx\r\nqui se seroient portez trop froidement en son endroit. Larticle de la\r\nlettre du gentilhomme qui vous porta ma lettre (qui me faict craindre\r\nque en voulant traicter de la part de la France avec fort grand respect\r\net par adventure prendre l’honneur devers nous l’affaire nen sera\r\npire) est quil dict que si lon estoit asseure par deça de la bonne\r\nvolonte de ceux de dela la mer on y pouroit entendre ce qui me semble\r\nestrange de vouloir qu’une ville se rende avant quelle soit sommee. Il\r\nme semble que cest beaucoup quelle parlamente, sans avoir ouyr parler\r\nle canon. Et nest par peu de chose qu’estant sa principalle defence\r\nde la difference de laage et de linconstance de la jeunesse et la\r\ncrainte destre dicy a quelques anees, peu aymes et mesprisee et en\r\ndanger de veoir de ses yeulx aymer dautres, lon luy a faict abandonner\r\nceste contre escarppe et le corrider tellement que lon peult veoir au\r\npied de la muraille que je vous asseure nest point veue de flans. Des\r\nparticularitez et moyens que lon a tenue en ses approches jusques la\r\njen ay dice quelque chose a ce gentilhomme qui est fort affectionne\r\na cest affaire en faveur du bien de la France. Et dabondant en hayne\r\nde la grandeur qui se voit preparer a la maison d’Autriche si elle\r\ns’impatronize de ce royaume, tellement quil nest a craindre si non\r\nque la tradiuite ne donne loisir a ceux qui de long temps ont faict\r\ndeseing de se saisir de ce pais de venyr au bout de leur intencions\r\nlesquelles sont fort favorablement receues, et croy quils jouyront en\r\nbref si leurs conseilz ne sont troublez par une diuersion & par obiect\r\nnouveau plus desirable que celuy qui ce presente Ce qui me semble\r\nestre indubitablement en la jeunesse d’un prince qui a la reputacion\r\ndavoir le sens meur devant les ans et ausi courageux et dausy grande\r\nespoirance que prince ne soit ne de lage des hommes. Monsieur vous\r\nscavez trop bien combien la maisson d’Autriche seroit agrandie sur\r\nla maison de France si elle estoit renforcee de ce royaume. Et ny a\r\npoint de doubte quelle ne donnast pour tousjours par cy apres la loy\r\na la France et est chose seure quelle contraindroit le roy a rompre\r\nla paix quil a donnee a ses subiectz. Davantage si par ce mariage\r\nnest donne satisfaction au grand coeur de mons^[r] frere du roy pour\r\nloccuper et luy donner matiere de faire plus grandz deseingz Il ne\r\nfault point doubter que tous ceux qui prennent la couleur et pretexte\r\nde la religion pour advancer les moiens de la divission et ruyne de la\r\nFrance afin d’agrandir la maison d’Autriche ne proposent a monsieur\r\nduc danjou quelques mariages qui sera au despens de la couronne de\r\nFrance si la bonne nature et amitie dentre les freres ne resiste a leur\r\nmalicieux deseingz. Mais il ne sen scauroit proposer du quel se doive\r\nespoirer plus de grandeur, non seulement a luy mais a toute la maison\r\nde France en gaignant le dessus sur la maison d Autriche, la quelle\r\nveult soubz couverture & douceur du mariage du roy faire avaller ceste\r\ncuree & gaigner ung royaume sans ce quil luy soit donne empeschement\r\net ne fault point doubter que si le mariage de larcheduc se faict quil\r\nne soit en peu de temps mieulx obey que na este le roy Philippe et ce\r\nmoiennant le danger de la religion et leur sera aise de nous donner la\r\nloy ou pour le mains de nous faire redoubler la ruyne de la France par\r\ndivision et guerre civille. Au contraire si ce bien est resceue pour\r\nnoz princes il y aura bien de quoy rendre la pareille a ceux qui ont\r\ndresse tous leurs conseilz a procurer que la France se ruynast par une\r\nguerre civille Voyans que par guerres ouvertes jamais ilz n’auroient\r\npeu paruenir a leur intencion. Pour amour du mal quilz ont faict mons^[r]\r\npouroit iustement avec forces du roy faveur dangleterre et moiens\r\ndu prince dorenge avoir la confiscacion de la Flandre par droict de\r\nfeodalite pour felonnie commise. Et ausy la maison d Autriche qui se\r\nbastit lempire hereditaire et la monarchie se trouveroit en ung instant\r\ndeux freres roys ausy puissans lun que lautre pour contrepois de son\r\nambition liggnez avec les princes protestans de lallemaigne et auroient\r\nles deux freres plus de part en lempire que ceux qui se veulent\r\natribuer par la ruyne des anciennes maisons de la Germanye come de la\r\nmaison de Saxe et des princes palatins qui sont amateurs de la couronne\r\nde France. Le partage de monsieur d allençon seroit aise a trouver en\r\nla duche de Millan auec la faueur de lallemaigne, des Suises ausy et\r\ndes princes Italliens devotieux de la France Et si besoing estoit po^[r]\r\nle recouvrement du royaume de Naples, la fave^[r] du Turc se trouveroit\r\npar apres ung a propos. Mons^[r] il ma semble que cela est si aparent, et\r\nsi facille a persuader que puis que vous en aurez une fois ouvert la\r\nbouche il ny faudra plus autre soliciteur que le roy mesmes qui peult\r\nveoir par ce moyen son royaume luy demourer uny ses freres partagez.\r\nSa force telle et si grande quil ne poura estre offence ny commande\r\npar menasses qui contraignent faire la guerre a ses subiects pour\r\ncomplaire a ceux qui sont envieux de sa grandeur et n’ont peu trouver\r\nmoyen de la diminuer que par elle mesmes. Lors ce pouroit faire une\r\nlegue parfaicte entre noz princes & les protestans de la Germanie & les\r\nsuisses. De ceste facon ung grand plaisir viendroit a la royne de veoir\r\ntous ses enfans roys. Lors leglisse galicane pouroit sexempter des\r\nerreurs de leglisse Romayne comme elle a faict plusieurs fois le temps\r\npasse, lors se pouroit faire ung concille general au quel les erreurs\r\nintroduictes par lambition et advarice de leglisse romayne ne seroient\r\nfavorisses et confirmees par praticques et corruptions, et en la France\r\nl’allemaigne et langleterre s’introduiroient une ordre et pollice\r\nde religion et unite de doctrine que toutes les autres provinces\r\nde la cristiente seroient contraintes dembrasser et finiroient les\r\ndifferens des subiectz avec leurs princes desquelles Sathan se sert\r\npour la destruction de la Christeente et pour donner loisir au turc\r\nd’usurper pendant que les princes Chrestiens s’amussent a defendre les\r\nsupersticions du Pape et maintenyr sa grande^[r].\r\n\r\nMonseigneur je me recommande treshumblement a votre bonne grace et\r\nvous suplie de rechef me departir de votre faveur et conseil touchant\r\ncomment je me doibs gouverner a escripre a leurs ma^[tes] ou non:\r\nMons^[r] je prie Dieu vous donner tresheureuse et treslongue vye.

Sur quoy j’avois advisé d’envoyer devers\r\nMons^[r] l’amyral pour avoir quarante enseignes de celles qui sont auprès\r\nde luy. Et estant presentement, venu devers moy le S^[r] de Beaulieu\r\nRuzé, que le S^[r] de Biron m’a depesché expres, tant pour aucunes\r\nparticularitez que j’ay donné charge au S^[r] de Lanconne (que j’envoye\r\ndevers vous) vous dire, que pour m’advertir, encores que les forces y\r\nsoient si petites qu’elles sont, qu’ilz estoient neanmoins d’adviz que\r\nje ne laissasse pas de m’acheminer au camp. Ce que j’ay resolu de faire\r\net de partir demain de ce lieu, pour m’en aller a Châtellerault et de\r\nla à Poictiers. Et cependant je renvoye ledict Ruzé devers ledict S^[r]\r\nde Biron pour me revenir trouver en chemin, et me rapporter au vray\r\nce que sera survenu depuis. Et ay depesché incontinant ung courrier\r\ndevers ledict S^[r] Amyral, pour faire partir tout aussy tost lesdictes\r\nquarante enseignes, ou ce qu’il me pourra envoyer, et qu’il les face\r\nembarquer à Moyssac, d’ou elles peulvent venir par eaue, jusques à La\r\nRochelle, luy ayant mandé les lieux par ou elles auront a passer et\r\npar mesmes moien audict S^[r] admiral et de Montferrant de pourveoir\r\nqu’il y ait des batteaulx et estappes des vivres. Et ne veoy aucune\r\nchose qui puisse apporter retardement a vostre service, que de n’avoir\r\nles deniers, pour pouvoir faire faire monstre a mon arrivée au camp,\r\nprincipallement aux gens de pied, d’autant qu’il est a craindre que,\r\nn’estans poinct payez et s’asseurans que je ferois porter argent avec\r\nmoy (comme je l’avois promis a celles de vostre garde et du capitaine\r\nGadz), ilz se desbendent et que le nombre que je m’attendz y estre n’y\r\nsoit poinct. Je vous supplie tres humblement, Monseigneur, de commander\r\nque l’on regarde de cercher tous les moyens dont l’on se pourra adviser\r\npour m’envoyer les troys cens mil livres que je debvois avoir avant mon\r\npartement de la Court.\r\n\r\nAu demeurant, Monseigneur, j’ay receu la lettre qu’il vous a pleu\r\nm’escripre du XIII^[e] de ce moys, et veu par le contenu d’icelle comme\r\nvous avez resolu deux poinctz. Le premier, de la suppression de tous\r\noffices qui vacqueront, pour congnoistre la grand charge que cela\r\napporte à vous et à voz subgectz, pour les gaiges qu’il leur fault\r\npayer. Et l’autre, que vous avez commandé qu’il ne soit depesché cy\r\napres aucun office ou benefice dont il vous sera baillé memoire ou\r\nplacet, que troys moys apres que vous verrez les roolles qui en seront\r\nfaictz, pour les departir à ceulx qui font service, principallement\r\nen ce camp auprès de moy. Ce que je ne fauldray leur faire entendre,\r\nsuivant ce qu’il vous plaist me mander. J’ay aussy veu le memoire\r\nque vous a esté baillé de ce que l’on vous propose pour la conqueste\r\nque vous pouvez faire à l’Yndie avec peu de despence, laquelle je ne\r\npuis trouver que très bonne, lorsque vous serez en paix et que voz\r\naffaires le pourront permectre, y estans les richesses et commoditez\r\nportées par ledict memoire. Vous sçavez combien telles entreprises et\r\nconquestes ont apporté de proffict au feu Empereur et Roy Catholique,\r\npour le grand nombre d’or qu’il a tiré et tire ordinairement du Peyrou,\r\ntellement que, sans cela, il n’eust eu moyen d’entretenir et soldoyer\r\nles armées et forces qu’il a entretenues jusques à present, qui me\r\nfaict vous conseiller (soubz vostre meilleur adviz) de ne laisser\r\npoinct perdre ceste occasion, quand vous congnoistrez qu’elle pourra\r\nestre mise a execution. Presentement, j’ay eu nouvelles que le S^[r]\r\nPaul Emille a tant faict que ceulx de La Rochelle qui le detiennent\r\nprisonnier l’ont mis à rançon pour mil escruz, dont aulcuns de ses amys\r\nont respondu pour luy. Laquelle somme il n’a aucun moyen de fournir,\r\nsi ce n’est de vostre liberalité, grace et specialle faveur, laquelle\r\nje vous supplie vouloir estendre en luy pour cest effect, et luy faire\r\nparoistre la souvenance que vous avez tousjours eu de ceulx qui vous\r\nfont service.

CXXXIV, NO. 186, iij\r\n\r\n[_Dr. Valentine Dale to Lord Burghley_]\r\n\r\n\r\nEs co tempore quo proximè ad te scripsi nullum fuit mihi prorsus\r\ntempus animi laxandi, ita fui partim itineribus partim multis gravibus\r\n& impeditis rebus administrandis distractus, nec satis etiam nunc\r\nscio an mihi liceat aliqua intermissione frui ut de liberioribus ac\r\namœnioribus studiis possim aliquantisper cogitare. Neque verò tuam nunc\r\nvolo sive tarditatem sive negligentiam in scribendo accusare nulla\r\nest enim mihi remissæ erga me tuæ amicitiæ vel minima suspitio. Ut\r\nscias igitur quid rerum hic agatur Nunquam tanta animorum consentione\r\nad pacem conspiratum est nec unquam tamen magis diversis studiis\r\nde pacis conditionibus ineundis actum est Coguntur enim planè jam\r\nomnes longo & ancipiti bello fessi & ad inopiam atque egestatem\r\nusque redacti necessario nunc tandem ac serio de pace cogitare.\r\nNeque enim aut æris alieni quo infinito premuntur dissolvendi ratio\r\nest, nec sumptus qui sunt apud istos profusissimi diutius sustinere\r\npossunt. Vectigalia autem ac ceteri reditus regii aut oppignorata\r\naut distracta sunt ut annui regis proventus ne ad erogationes quidem\r\ndomesticas satis sufficiant. Vident igitur omnes si bellum gerendum\r\nsit, infinita contributione opus esse, cum nullæ sint principis ad\r\nbellum gerendum facultates, & omnis qua opus sit regi pecunia ab\r\naliis sumenda aut potius extorquenda sit. Homines autem nobiles per\r\nquos bellum precipuè geritur quorum amplissimæ sunt facultates (nam\r\nhi pæne soli prædia possident & vicena aut tricena aut etiam centena\r\nplerique millia aureorum nummum habent annua). Hi quantam alicunde\r\npecuniam corradere possunt eam prodige & profuse ilico profundunt,\r\nnulla est enim eis cura rei familiaris, sed tanqam in diem viventes\r\nquibus opus habent rebus quantivis comparant eam quam habent pecuniam\r\nnegligentes & quam non habent quibusvis rationibus vel quamvis cum\r\njactura conquirentes. Solent autem illis ut plurimum belli presertim\r\ntempore sumptus a rege subministrari. Nunc autem quum videant nihil\r\nesse regi, quod det, corpora sua periculis libenter non subjiciunt,\r\ninviti autem hoc presertim tempore ad bellum non adiguntur, itaque\r\nfit ut qui ferè uni pro principe soliti sint decertare hi bellum in\r\nprimis detrectent. Plebs autem rustica inops semper est atque egena,\r\nnon enim ut nostri improvidos reperiunt prediorum dominos, a quibus\r\nprerogata quadam modica pecunia exili reditu conductis agris, ad magnas\r\nopes perveniant, sed aut Coloni partiarii agrum magno labore parvo\r\nautem cum compendio colunt, aut justum fructuum precium pendunt. Hoc\r\nverò tempore vastationibus populationibus & direptionibus ita sunt\r\nexpilati, ut nec bos ad arandum nec frumentum ad sementes faciendas\r\nsupersit: tantum abest ut illorum pecunia bellum geri possit. Reliqua\r\nsunt oppida que sanè sunt multa & cives certe ditissimi Nam que\r\nmagna ut scis nostris est trium millium coronatorum pecunia, apud\r\nistos ducentorum aut trecentorum millium exiguè sunt facultates, &\r\nqui urbes incolunt soli aut sub pignoribus & hypothecis nobilium\r\nproventus possident, aut eorum facultates fœnere exhauriunt. Inter\r\nistos autem cives opifices non nomino, quorum infinitus est numerus\r\nqui admodum difficulter victum magnis laboribus in urbibus querunt\r\nnon enim in agris locus illis est ubi se ac suos tenuiter colendis\r\nagris aut pecore pascendo, ut nostri faciunt, alant. Itaque in urbis\r\nquisque proximas se confert, ubi officinas instituunt & vitam labore\r\nproducunt. Multo minus inter cives numerandi sunt hi, qui passim in\r\nviis scatent omnibus oratoriis preceptis ac artibus instructi quo\r\nhominum mentes ad elemosinam & commiserationem permoveant. Neque etiam\r\nbonos illos viros hic nomino, quorum magnus est numerus qui se fratres\r\ndici volunt, quamvis inter se odiis plusquam fraternis dissideant quos\r\nego planè eos esse existimo quos Chaucerus noster ex loco illo parum\r\nhonesto sese proripere scribit, qui nugas ac nenias venditando in eam\r\nauthoritatem pervenerunt. Ut æquum existiment rogari potius sese quam\r\nrogare: tanquam viri omnibus virtutibus excellentes ad quorum pedes\r\nbona nostra projicere debeamus, quanquam illorum pæne jam explosa\r\nest disciplina ab illis quorum novum est ancupium qui se Jesuistas\r\nappellant, & perfecti volunt esse, juxta illud. Estote perfecti sicut\r\nego sum, inter quos Darbesherus noster non est minimus apostolorum si\r\nnoster dicendus est qui & nos & seipsum deservit & aliam vitam alios\r\nmores sequitur, illi autem quos dixi Cives qui tantum opibus valent,\r\nclientelis miseorum opificum in quos imperium habent & suis divitiis\r\nfreti, pecuniam sibi imperari non patiuntur, sciunt enim neminem\r\nesse qui eos cogere possit, cum rex parum fisus nobilibus, tutelam\r\nurbium arma, machinas, bellicas, mœnia, & quicquid est roboris illis\r\ncommiserit, rogati autem immensas & crebras priores pensitationes &\r\ntributa causantur itaque pauxillulam tandem aliquam pecuniam prout nec\r\ncausa postulat tanquam ab invitis quasi vi sibi exprimi patiuntur.\r\nJam Episcopi Abbates & alii quibus opima sunt sacerdotia cum videant\r\nomnium oculos in se ac bona sua esse conjectos nec aliquam aliam\r\nesse rationem conficiende pecuniæ nisi quæ ex eorum bonis & prediis\r\ndistrahendis redigatur. Quis erit (inquiunt) tandem nostri expilandi\r\nfinis si bellum adhuc duret. An non sex decimas annuas fructuum\r\nnostrorum pensitamus. Vix annus adhuc est quod octingenta millia\r\nfrancorum que sunt centena millia librarum nostrarum in profectionem\r\nPolonicam dedimus jamque nos urgent Questores regii ad solutionem\r\nunius millionis & dimidiæ francorum, que summa est quingentorum\r\nmillium coronatorum gallicorum, quos rex approbante pontifice nobis\r\nextorquet: cujus pecuniæ solvendæ rationem nullam adhuc habemus. Non\r\ntametsi pontifex ad rem tam piam nempe ad bellum intestinum alendum,\r\npredia ecclesiastica ad eum summam venire permiserit, emptores tamen\r\nnon reperiuntur, coguntque nos officiales & ministri regii pecuniam\r\nquam non habemus, nostro periculo representare: recepturos aliquando\r\nex distractione bonorum, si qui tandem reperiantur, qui tam dubio jure\r\nlitem futuram presenti pecunia velint comparare non enim ignotæ sunt\r\nartes pontificiæ: Veniet namque facile tempus cum Pontifex iste aut\r\nsuccessor aliquis ejus restitutionem in integrum pro ecclesia non sine\r\ndirarum etiam imprecatione a se impetrari facillime patiatur, nulla\r\nhabita eorum ratione qui in bona ecclesiastica pecuniam impenderunt.\r\nItaque eo ventum est ut hi quorum causa bellum hoc geritur & qui\r\nevangelicos plurimum oderunt hi nunc pacem maximè expetant, & quemvis\r\nDei cultum potius permittant, quam se indies argento emungi patiantur\r\nimò quidvis inquiunt potius in malam rem doceant Hugonoti, neque enim\r\nmagis ab illis quam ab istis possumus expilari. Nec est illorum non\r\ninepta sanè oratio. Jam homines miseri qui sedibus pulsi patria carent,\r\ninopes vagantur, quibus insidiæ undique tenduntur, supplicia & mortes\r\nintentantur, qui deserti ab omnibus, perpetuas excubias ad sese tuendos\r\nagunt hi pacem si unqam antehac nunc certè fessi ac defatigati miserè\r\ncupiunt, ut aliquis tandem sit laborum finis & patria terra quiescere\r\nliceat. Nemo est igitur qui non uno ore pacem affectet, ad pacem\r\noculos, animum & omnes cogitationes convertat. Quin & Pontifex ipse\r\nsibi timens & veritus quem res nec sit habitura exitum, & precipuè de\r\ncomitatu Avinionensi sollicitus, alios non lacessitos esse malit, quam\r\nde suis rebus in periculum venire: sperans futurum ut rex intermisso\r\nbello integris viribus eos facile opprimat, quos nunc lacerato regno\r\nsatis vexare non possit. Ex qua re factum est, ut sermonibus hominum\r\ncerta pax facta, & negocium prorsus transactum esse diceretur, & ea\r\nfama per uniuersum orbem sparsa sit, pacem jam manibus teneri. Sed\r\ncum de pacis conditionibus agi ceptum est, longe fuerunt alie hominum\r\nvoluntates, longè alius rei exitus. Nam quibus antea sua facilitate\r\nimpositum est, ne in idem discrimen inciderent Evangelicæ libertati\r\n& saluti sue presidiis, urbibus ac rebus aliis que ad vitam tuendam\r\npertinent sibi consulere voluerunt, nec se aliorum fidei committendos\r\nesse censuerunt quin rebus omnibus integris arma sumere possent, ut si\r\nnon melior at saltem non deterior istis pactionibus illorum conditio\r\nfieret. Alii contra qui spe miseros illos homines devorarant & sibi\r\noccasionem egregiam oblatam existimabant, incautos homines vafricia\r\n& insidiis prorsus opprimendi, cum viderent non esse locum dolis\r\nquin potius futurum ut Evangelium propagaretur, nec esse in illorum\r\npotestate, ut istis conditionibus homines Evangelici exterminarentur,\r\nquidvis potius faciendum esse suadebant, quam locum illis dari quos\r\nextinctos esse cupiunt, hi & se & sua omnia regi offerunt, & quoduis\r\ndiscrimen subeundum esse censent. Itaque nunc Pontifex bellum alioqui\r\nformidans pecuniam mutuam satis amplam u(l)troneus offert: (sibi tamen\r\nsatis callide pignoribus cavens) ut regis animum a pacis cogitatione\r\navertat. Sunt etiam alii viri providi & rebus suis prospicientes, qui\r\nsciunt vetus illud esse, mobilia esse gallorum ingenia ad suscipiendum\r\nbellum (neque enim in tanta penuria & tantes difficultatibus de aliis\r\nperturbandis desinunt cogitare, nec istis unquam aut voluntas aut\r\npecunia ad alios vexandos deest) qui ista penitius perspiciunt & sibi\r\nprudenter cavent, hi frigidam suffundunt, pristinam gloriam nominis\r\ngallici commemorantes, & ignominiam ob oculos ponentes, si tale dedecus\r\nsubeatur ut quasi victi manus tendere, & leges jam non dare sed\r\naccipere cogantur, futurum ut tempore vires regia crescant, alii contra\r\nvel simultatibus solvantur, vel insidiis opprimantur, vel premiis &\r\npollicitationibus separentur, qua ex re fiet aliquando ut rex victor\r\nstirpem illam hominum prorsus exterminet, & ecclesiæ Romane vindex\r\neternam sibi famam ad posteros transmittat. Hic ego si tibi que fuerint\r\npostulata, que responsa, que argumenta in utramque partem adducta,\r\nqua constantia permansum sit in petitis, quibus artibus Evangelicorum\r\nlegati tentati sint, quibus intercessoribus res tractata sit, historiam\r\ntibi non epistolam scriberem nolo tamen tibi ignotum esse egregiam\r\nfuisse in hac re Helvetiorum protestantium operam, ego autem quod potui\r\nporro ut est apud comicum nostrum. His igitur rebus effectum est ut\r\npost multas & longas de pace disceptationes incertiores simus multo\r\nquam dudum, pacem enim facere noluit bellum autem gerere non possunt.\r\n\r\nCum ista superiora aliquot dies scripta apud me haberem, nec\r\ndescribendi esset ocium accepi tandem tuas vicesimo quarto Maii\r\nscriptas, ex quibus intelligo esse etiam apud vos fidefragos, ut tuo\r\nverbo utar, nam fœdifragos usquam gentium reperiri non est fas dicere,\r\nitaque nactus ocium te istis quibuscunque carere nolui, nec si tibi\r\nsit cordi ullum laborem recusabo, quin priores etiam meas queas tu le\r\namisisse tantopere quereris descriptas ad te mittam.

See p. 3, note 1.\r\n\r\n[5] The origin of the Scotch Guard goes back to the Hundred Years’\r\nWar. In 1420, five years after the battle of Agincourt, when Henry V\r\nwas in possession of all of northern France, the dauphin, Charles VII,\r\nsent the count of Vendôme to Scotland to ask for assistance in virtue\r\nof the ancient league between the two nations. In 1421 a body of 1,000\r\nScots arrived in France under the earl of Buchan. They fought at Baugé\r\nin Anjou in that year, but were almost all destroyed in 1424 in the\r\nfurious battle of Verneuil. The remnant, in honor of their services,\r\nbecame the king’s own guard. See Skene, _The Book of Pluscarden_,\r\nII, xix-xxi, xxvi-xxix; Houston, _L’Escosse françois_ (Discours des\r\nalliances commencées depuis l’an sept cents septante, et continuées\r\njusques à present, entre les couronnes de France et d’Escosse), Paris,\r\n1608; Forbes Leith, _The Scots Men-at-Arms and Life Guards in France,\r\nfrom Their Formation until Their Final Dissolution_, 2 vols., 1882.\r\nThe Guard consisted of the principal captain, the lieutenant, and the\r\nensign, the maréchal-de-loges, three commis, eighty archers of the\r\nguard, twenty-four archers of the corps; the pay of whom amounted\r\nannually to 51,800 francs, or 6,475 pounds sterling.—_C. S. P. For._,\r\nNo. 544, December, 1559.\r\n\r\n[6] Claude Haton, whose Catholic prejudice was strong, believed this\r\nreluctance to be feigned (_Mémoires_, I, 107).\r\n\r\n[7] D’Aubigné, Book II, chap, xiv, says the blow raised the King’s\r\nvisor, and that the end of the lance, which was bound with a _morne_,\r\nor ring, to dull the point, crashed through the helmet like a bludgeon.\r\nTavannes, chap, xiv, says that the King had failed to take the\r\nprecaution to fasten his visor down.\r\n\r\n[8] Throckmorton to the Lords in Council, _C. S. P. For._, June 30,\r\n1559.\r\n\r\n[9] D’Aubigné, _loc. cit._ La Place, 20, says that the King spoke to\r\nthe cardinal of Lorraine. De Thou, Book II, 674, on the authority of\r\nBrantôme, doubts it.\r\n\r\n[10] The Palais des Tournelles stood in the present Place Royale.

De Ruble, _Antoine de\r\nBourbon et Jeanne d’Albret_, I, 432, has published Vesalius’ official\r\nreport. Henry II had a body-physician who also enjoyed a European\r\nreputation. This was Fernal. He was the author of a Latin work upon\r\npathology which was translated into French in 1660 under the title: _La\r\npathologie de Jean Fernal, premier medicin de Henry II, roy de France,\r\nouvrage très-utile à tous ceux qui s’appliquent à la connoissance du\r\ncorps humain_.\r\n\r\n[14] There is an account of the funeral in _Arch. cur._, III, 309-48.\r\nThe MS account of the funeral expenses is in the Phillipps Collection,\r\n2,995.

S. P. For._,\r\nJuly 13, 1559, No. 985, Throckmorton to the Queen: “It is thought\r\nthat the treaty already made is void by the French King’s death; ...\r\nthat the king of Spain, seeing his advantage and knowing the state of\r\nFrance better than he did when he made that peace, will either make new\r\ndemands, or constrain France to do as he will have them, who would be\r\nloath to break with him again.”\r\n\r\n[29] Tavannes, _op. cit._\r\n\r\n[30] Jacques d’Alban de St. André, born in the Lyonnais, marshal\r\n1547, favorite of Henry II. He was taken prisoner at the battle of\r\nSt. Quentin. After the death of Henry II, fearing prosecution for his\r\nenormous stealings in office, he became the tool of the Guises. See\r\nLa Planche, 205, 206; _Livre des marchands_, 438, 439; and especially\r\nBoyvin du Villars, 904 ff., on his administration in Provence.\r\n\r\n[31] Brissac was governor of Piedmont under Henry II, where he\r\nsustained the interests of France so energetically that Philip hated\r\nhim. The Guises made great efforts to attach him to their party, with\r\nthe hope of playing him against the Bourbons and Montmorencys (Paris,\r\n_Négociations_, 73, note). After the peace of Cateau-Cambrésis, the\r\nfortresses of the duke of Savoy were dismantled, to the intense anger\r\nof the latter. Cf. Fillon Collection, 2,654: Letter of July 16, 1560,\r\nto the duchess of Mantua, complaining that the people of Caluz have\r\nrevolted against the authority of the marshal Brissac. This hard\r\nfeeling probably explains Brissac’s transfer to the government of\r\nPicardy, in January, 1560, to the chagrin of the prince of Condé, who\r\nasked for the place (Varillas, _Hist. de François II_, II, 35; De Thou,\r\nBook XXV, 518) after the marriage of Emanuel Philibert to the sister of\r\nHenry II. See Marchand, _Charles I de Cossé, comte de Brissac_, Paris,\r\n1889, chap. xvi.\r\n\r\n[32] La Place, 26.\r\n\r\n[33] _C. S. P. For._, Nos. 1,121, 1,149, August 4 and August 8, 1559.\r\n\r\n[34] _C. S. P. For._, No. 972, July 11, 1559.\r\n\r\n[35] Tavannes, 244. In Spain it was the prevailing belief that France\r\nhad been compelled to make the peace of Cateau-Cambrésis more through\r\nthe troubles caused by the affairs of religion than from any other\r\nnecessity; cf. _C. S. P. Ven._, No. 57, 1559. This suspicion is\r\nconfirmed by Tavannes, who says that the settlement of matters still\r\npending under the terms of the treaty was hastened by the Guises\r\nthrough knowledge that the state of affairs in France was exceedingly\r\nunsatisfactory to many of the nobles and fear that their power would\r\nbe openly rebelled against (Tavannes, 245; _C. S. P. For._, No. 590,\r\nJanuary 18, 1560, and No. 26, October 5, 1559).\r\n\r\n[36] The pretext was Montmorency’s complaint because his son Damville\r\nwas not given the government of Provence, which St. André had held\r\n(_Rel. vén._, I, 435; cf. _Nég. Tosc._, III, 401).\r\n\r\n[37] “Vieil routier.”—La Planche, 207.\r\n\r\n[38] “Le connestable ... resigna bien d’estat de grand-maistre entre\r\nles mains du roy, mais purement et simplement, et non en faveur\r\ndu dict de Guyse, déclarant assez qu’il ne cédoit en rien à son\r\nadversaire.”—La Planche, 216. Cf. D’Aubigné, I, 245, Book II, chap.\r\nxiv; _Rel. vén._, I, 393; Tavannes, 245; Castlenau, Book I, chap. ii;\r\nBaschet, _La diplomatie venétienne_, 495. La Place, 26, is in error. An\r\nattempt was made to soften Montmorency’s fall by making his eldest son\r\na marshal of France; Tavannes, 245; _C. S. P. For._, No. 376, December\r\n5, 1559.\r\n\r\n[39] La Planche, 203.\r\n\r\n[40] Castelnau, Book I, chap. iii.\r\n\r\n[41] See the interesting analysis of public opinion by La Planche,\r\n203. On p. 208 he gives a highly drawn picture of the venality of the\r\nparlements, whose “ancienne splendeur estoit desja esvannoye peu à\r\npeu,” while they were frequented by “les soliciteurs des courtisans,\r\net les advocats favoris des grands,” in whose precincts justice was\r\nnot possible for simple, honest folk. He is as bitter in speaking of\r\nthe _conseil des affaires_ and the _conseil privé_, but it must be\r\nremembered that the author was a Protestant and imbued with hatred\r\nagainst the government because of its persecution of the Huguenots. See\r\nTavannes’ (p. 243) eulogy of the French bar which is nearer the truth.\r\n\r\n[42] For Henry II’s policy toward Protestantism see De Crue, _Anne de\r\nMontmorency_, 244-48; Weiss, _La chambre ardente_, Introd.; Hauser, “De\r\nl’humanisme et de la réforme en France,” _Rev. hist._, LXIV (1897),\r\n258, minimizes the intellectual causes of the French Reformation.\r\n\r\n[43] The origin of this word has been much discussed. In the early\r\nperiod of the Reformation in France, all religious schismatics save\r\nthe Vaudois, whose historical identity was different and familiar,\r\nwere called “Lutherans.” The Venetian ambassador so characterized the\r\nFrench Protestants in a dispatch to the signory in 1558 (_Relazione de\r\nGiovanni Sorano_, ed. Alberi, I, 2, 409). Boyvin du Villars (Book XII,\r\n204) employs this same term in 1560.\r\n\r\nThe etymology of the word “Huguenot,” most commonly accepted is that\r\nwhich derives it from the German word _Eidgenossen_ (confederacy) which\r\ndesignated the Swiss Confederates (see _Papiers d’état du cardinal de\r\nGranvelle_, VII, 660). The word in Geneva was naturally not German\r\nbut French or Savoyard. It is variously spelled—Eydgenots, Eygenots,\r\nEyguenots. But this derivation, though the best supported, is opposed\r\nby the eminent philologist, Littré. Grandmaison, _Bulletin Soc.\r\nhist. prot. franç._, LI (January, 1902), argues against the German\r\norigin of the word and gives examples of its appearance as a French\r\nsurname from the fourteenth century onward. But how it came to be\r\napplied to the French Protestants he is unable to say. Cf. Weiss: “La\r\ndérivation du nom Huguenot,” _Bull. Soc. hist. prot. franç._, XLVIII,\r\n12 (December, 1898). A note by A. Mazel states that in Languedoc the\r\nword was pronounced “Duganau,” which he conjectures to be a diminutive\r\nof “Fugou,” the great owl. If this is so, the origin of the word is\r\nakin to that of “Chouan” in the French Revolution. The earliest use of\r\nthe word “Huguenot” in Languedoc is in Devic and Vaisette, _Histoire\r\ndu Languedoc_, XI, 342. It undoubtedly was a term of reproach,\r\n_ibid._, XI, 374, note; cf. Claude Haton, I, 121. Without attempting\r\nto pronounce upon the origin of the word, I subjoin some allusions\r\nwhich I have come upon. Castelnau, Book II, chap, vii, says: “qui\r\ndepuis s’appelèrent huguenots en France, dont l’étymologie fut prise\r\nà la conjuration d’Amboise, lors que ceux qui devoient présenter la\r\nrequeste, comme éperdus de crainte, fuyoient de tous costés. Quelques\r\nfemmes des villages dirent que c’estoient pauvres gens, qui ne\r\nvalloient pas des huguenots, qui estoient une forte petite monnoye,\r\nencore pire que des mailles, du temps de Hugues Capet d’où vint en\r\nusage que par moquerie l’on les appelloit huguenots.” Henri Estienne\r\nand La Place, 34, say the word arose from the circumstance that the\r\nCalvinists of Tours used to go outside of the Porte du roy Huguon to\r\nworship. La Planche’s derivation is a study in folklore (p. 262, col.\r\ni).\r\n\r\nThe Venetian ambassador wrote in 1563: “In quel tempo medesimo fu tra\r\nquesti principalmente, che cercorno di seminar la false dottrina un\r\npredicator della regina di Navarra, madre del presente re di Navarra,\r\nnominate Ugo, il quale alienò prima l’animo di quella regina dalla\r\nreligion cattolica, e poi cercò d’alienare e di corromper, come fece,\r\ninfiniti altri uomini e donne delli più grandi.”—_Rel. vén._, II,\r\n50. A unique explanation, which I have not found noticed elsewhere is\r\npreserved by Jean de Gaufreton, _Chronique bordelaise_ (1877), I, 92:\r\n“En cette année les catholiques commencèrent d’appeller les Luthériens\r\net protestants ‘Huguenots,’ et les autres nomèrent les catholicques\r\npapistes à cause, qu’ils tenoyent le parti du pape, et qu’ils\r\nsoustenoyent son authorité. Mais la raison pourquoy les Luthériens\r\nfurent appellées Huguenots procède de ce que les princes protestants\r\nd’Allemagne et Luthériens ayant envoyé une solemnelle ambassade au roy,\r\nà la requête des Luthériens et protestants de France pour demander\r\nlibre exercice du Luthéranisme en son royaume, en faveur des dits\r\nLuthériens français, comme le chef de cette ambassade voulut en sa\r\npremière audience parler latin devant le roy, assisté des messieurs de\r\nson conseil, il ne put jamais dire que les deux mots à sçavait ‘hue\r\nnos’ et s’arresta tout court. Despuis les courtisans appellèrent les\r\nLuthériens françois ‘hue nos,’ et en suite ‘Huguenots.’”\r\n\r\n[44] Isambert, XIII, 494.\r\n\r\n[45] Weiss, _La chambre ardente_, Paris, 1889, a study of liberty of\r\nconscience under Henry II, based upon about five hundred _arrêts_\r\nrendered by the Parlement of Paris between May, 1547, and March, 1550.\r\nBefore its creation heresy was dealt with by the regular courts. In\r\n_Bulletin des comités historiques_ (1850), 173 (“Inventaire des lettres\r\nrelatives à l’histoire de France aux archives de Bâle”), there is noted\r\na letter of the King written in 1552 to the effect that those who have\r\nbeen arrested for heresy at Lyons shall not be dealt with unjustly; but\r\nthe King reiterates his determination not to permit any new religious\r\ndoctrine to obtain. In the very month before his death, in June, 1559,\r\nthe edict of Ecouan prescribed the death penalty for all heretics,\r\nwithout the least limitation or restriction, and with injunctions to\r\nthe judges not to mitigate the punishment, as they had done for some\r\nyears (Castelnau, Book I, chap. iii). The Huguenots regarded Henry\r\nII’s death as a judgment of God.—_C. S. P. For._, No. 899, June 30,\r\n1559: “They let not openly to say the King’s dissolute life and his\r\ntyranny to the professors of the gospel hath procured God’s vengeance.”\r\nA letter of Diane de Poitiers in the _Catalogue de la collection\r\nTrémont_, No. 424, proves that some of the property confiscated from\r\nthe Huguenots was given by the King to his favorite.\r\n\r\n[46] Vargas, _Histoire de François II_, 314.\r\n\r\n[47] Granvella to Philip II, June 14, 1561—_Papiers d’état du cardinal\r\nde Granvelle_, VI, 569.\r\n\r\n[48] Armstrong, _Wars of Religion in France_, 4, 5.

The one of these perceiving that the cardinal works\r\nto ruin them, and their own peculiar force not sufficient to withstand\r\nhis malice, have shown appearance that they will join with the other,\r\nwho seeing themselves excluded from all government, and those of\r\nGuise to usurp the whole authority, presently practise a firm faction\r\nand league between themselves, either part promising to support the\r\nother.”—_C. S. P. For._, No. 2,235, May 31, 1568.\r\n\r\n[66] _Rel. vén._, I, 523-25; II, 57; Davila, VI, 359. Claude Haton\r\nemphatically asserts the feudal purposes of the Huguenot noblesse:\r\n“Les grand seigneurs de la ligue condéienne et cause huguenoticque\r\ns’atendoient d’estre haults eslevez, non és offices royaux, mais au\r\npartage du royaume qu’ilz espéroient faire entre eux en le contonnant\r\npar provinces, desquelles ilz prétendoient d’estre seigneurs\r\nsouverains, sans recognoistre roy ni aultre personne par dessus\r\neux.”—I, 291. Tavannes characterizes the Huguenot association in 1572\r\nas “demi-democratique et demi-aristocratique” (_Panth. lit._, 413). The\r\nidentification of Calvinism with the political purposes of the nobles\r\nis shown in the following letter of the cardinal de Tournon to King\r\nHenri II, written “De Bains de Lucques, 9 juillet 1559”: “L’une des\r\nprincipal ruses de ces malheureux est de commencer, s’ils peuvent, à\r\nsemer leur venin et mauvaise doctrine par les plus Grands, les attirer\r\net gaigner à eux, afin de pouvoir après tout plus aisément & sans\r\npunition, infecter & gaster le reste & s’aider à un besoin de leur\r\nforce & authorité.”—Ribier, II, 807.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal Tournon and the admiral Hennebault had been trusted\r\nwith the duties of affairs of state after the fall of the constable\r\nMontmorency in 1541. When Henry II came to the throne Montmorency\r\nwas restored to office and Tournon fell. After the death of Henry II\r\nthe queen mother proposed the return of Cardinal Tournon. The Guises\r\nat first hesitated, but soon yielded, first because the cardinal was\r\nthe personal enemy of the constable, and second, because he was very\r\nhostile to the reformed religion (_Rev. hist._, XIV, 72, 73).\r\n\r\n[67] From an admirable article by E. Armstrong, “The Political\r\nTheory of the Huguenots,” _Eng. Hist Rev._, IV, 13 ff. Cf.

The queen\r\nof Spain, in company with Antoine of Navarre and Jeanne d’Albret,\r\narrived at Pau on December 21, having proceeded from Bordeaux.\r\nGreat preparations were made for her reception and she was nobly\r\nentertained. The king and queen of Navarre did their part with great\r\nmagnificence. The maître des postes of Spain arrived at Pau the same\r\nday as Her Majesty did, with instructions how she was to conduct\r\nherself toward the Spanish nobles by whom she was to be met on her\r\narrival in Spain.—“Extraict,” written in a French hand, indorsed “My\r\nLord Ambassador,” _C. S. P. For._, II, No. 469, December 21, 1559.\r\nThe king and queen of Navarre and the cardinal Bourbon conducted her\r\nto the frontiers and then returned; the prince of Roche-sur-Yon went\r\nthrough with her to Guadalajara and carried to Philip the order of\r\nSt. Michael (_C. S. P. For._, No. 337, November 29, 1559: Killigrew\r\nand Jones to the Queen). Philip II planned to meet his spouse at\r\nGuadalajara and thence go to Toledo, where the marriage festivities\r\nwere to be celebrated until Shrovetide (_C. S. P. For._, No. 354:\r\nChalloner to Cecil from Brussels). At the celebration, the duke of\r\nInfantado, whose guest the King was at Guadalajara, had sixty shepherds\r\nclad in cloth-of-gold (_C. S. P. For._, No. 540, January 24, 1560).\r\nThe marriage was accomplished on January 20, 1560 (_C. S. P. For._,\r\nNo. 540, January 24, 1560: statement of Granvella to Challoner). The\r\nFrench were offended because, at the receiving of the Queen-Catholic at\r\nGuadalajara, the verse of the forty-fifth Psalm was sung, “Audi, filia,\r\net vide, etc.,” which the French disliked much, “concluding that they\r\ndid not have altogether that which they looked for at King Philip’s\r\nhands by means of his wife” (_C. S. P. For._, No. 591, January 18,\r\n1560: Killigrew and Jones to Cecil).\r\n\r\n[90] See a letter of Francis II to the bishop of Limoges, May 21,\r\n1506, “De l’ambassadeur espagnol, Perrenot de Chantonnay, et de ses\r\nintrigues,” in Paris, _Négociations_, 584. Thomas Perrenot, sieur\r\nde Chantonnay, was a younger brother of the cardinal Granvella and\r\nwas a native of Besançon. He was named Spanish ambassador in France\r\nafter the treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis (Paris, _Nég. relatives au\r\nrègne de François II_, 56-60). His official correspondence is in\r\nthe _Archives nationales_ at Paris, K. 1,492 ff. Quite as valuable\r\nis the private correspondence he maintained with his brother and\r\nMargaret of Parma, transcripts of which are in the Brussels archives.\r\nThe originals are divided between Besançon and Vienna. M. Paris\r\npertinently says of him: “On ne sait pas assez toutes des manœuvres\r\nde ce personnage.”—_Négociations relatives au règne de François II_,\r\n56, note. A history of his public career would be a cross-section of\r\nthe history of the times. He spoke French and German fluently and had\r\na knowledge of Spanish and Italian. Catherine de Medici feared and\r\nhated him and in August, 1560, demanded his recall in vain.—Paris,\r\n_Négociations_, etc., 873. In 1564 he was transferred to Vienna (_R.\r\nQ. H._, January, 1879, 19, 20) and was succeeded by Alava. All the\r\nofficial correspondence of the epoch abounds with allusions to him.\r\nSee _Papiers d’état du cardinal de Granvelle_, VII, 393, 400, 402,\r\n518, 592; VIII, 353, 383, 387, 457, 513, 523, 557, 568, 574, 594, 679;\r\nIX, 1, 36, 65, 94-102, 136, 154, 166, 169, 177, 182-98, 225, 421, 264,\r\n345-52, 358, 361, 377-81, 394, 415, 430, 434-37, 446, 452, 461, 468,\r\n482, 489, 510, 514, 522, 538, 540-43, 549-52, 556-58, 562-64, 567, 568,\r\n581-89, 602-9, 615, 625, 628, 654, 668, 671; Gachard, _Correspondance\r\nde Philippe II_, II, 27, 48, 89, 108, 121, 163, 171-74; Poulet,\r\n_Correspondance du cardinal de Granvelle_, I, 565, note; _R.

See also Weiss’s introduction to edition of _Papiers d’état du\r\ncardinal de Granvelle_, I.\r\n\r\n[91] _C. S. P. For._, No. 543.\r\n\r\n[92] _Ibid._, No. 508, December 27. Throckmorton wrote to the council\r\non February 4, 1560: “At present the French have to bestir themselves\r\nfor the good and quiet of their own country, as factions in religion\r\nare springing up everywhere.”—_Ibid._, No. 685. Indeed, the chancellor\r\nat this time for three days refused to sign an order necessary for\r\nthe prosecution of the war in Scotland, on the ground of the dangers\r\nat home and the necessity of harboring the government’s resources\r\n(_ibid._, No. 292, November 18, 1559: Killigrew and Jones to Cecil).\r\nAmong the financial expedients resorted to at this time was an order\r\nin December, 1559, that all posts and postmasters should henceforth\r\nbe deprived of the fees which they enjoyed which amounted to 100,000\r\ncrowns yearly, and for compensation to them the price of letters was\r\nincreased a fourth part (_ibid._, No. 508, December, 1559). On May\r\n29, 1560, a royal ordinance abolished the King’s support of the post\r\nentirely and some new ordinances of Parlement were calculated to\r\nincrease the revenue by 2,000,000 francs (_ibid._, No. 550, January\r\n6, 1560). In February the King raised a loan of 7,000 francs at 8\r\nper cent. from the Parisians (_ibid._, No. 750, February 20, 1560:\r\nThrockmorton to the Queen).\r\n\r\n[93] “Six score commissions are sent forth for the persecution for\r\nreligion.”—_Ibid._, No. 451: Killigrew and Jones to the Queen,\r\nDecember 18, 1559. This was just after the murder of the president\r\nMinard. “The Cardinal of Lorraine lately sent a bag full of commissions\r\nfor persecution to be done about Poitiers and certain letters which he\r\ncarried apart in his bosom; the messenger was met and the letters taken\r\nfrom him.”—_Ibid._, No. 590, January 18, 1560. One of these—“Lettre\r\nde roi à tous les évêques de son royaume”—is preserved in K. 1,494,\r\nfol. 4. It is dated January 28, 1560.\r\n\r\n[94] _Nég. Tosc._, III, 408, January 22, 1560. On January 29 a poor\r\nman, a binder of books, was condemned to be burned for heresy at Rouen.\r\nWhile riding in a cart between two friars to be burned, a quarrel was\r\nmade with a sergeant who convoyed him and he was unhorsed, the poor\r\nman was taken out of the cart, his hands were loosed, and a cloak was\r\nthrown over him, and he was conveyed out of the hands of his enemies.\r\nThe justices and the governors, having knowledge of this, commanded the\r\ngates to be shut, and, making a search that night, found him again and\r\nburned him next day. And at his burning were three hundred men-at-arms,\r\nfor fear of the people (_C. S. P. For._, No. 708, February 8, 1560).\r\n\r\n[95] _C. S. P. For._, No. 256, November 14, 1559; _ibid._, _Ven._, No.\r\n132, March 6, 1560.\r\n\r\n[96] Baschet, I, 559; cf. _Nég. Tosc._, III, 310, January, 1560.\r\n\r\n[97] The fear of attempts being made to assassinate them or the King\r\nhaunted the cardinal and his brother. In November the French King,\r\nwhile out hunting near Blois, became so terrified, that he returned\r\nto court, and orders were given to the Scotch Guard to wear jack and\r\nmail and pistols (_C. S. P. For._, No. 166, November 15, 1559); in\r\nDecember rumors reached the cardinal’s ears that his own death and that\r\nof the duke of Guise was sworn (_ibid._, No. 528); in January the use\r\nof _tabourins_ and masks in court pleasures was forbidden on account\r\nof the fear which the cardinal of Lorraine had of being assassinated\r\n(_ibid._, No. 658, January 28, 1559). De Thou says the cardinal was\r\n“natura timidus.”—Book XXV. The wearing of pistols and firearms\r\nwas prohibited by two edicts, the one of July 3, 1559, the other of\r\nDecember 17, 1559. The law also forbade the wearing of long sleeves\r\nor cloaks or even top boots, in which a pistol or a poignard might\r\nbe concealed. Both measures were attributed with good reason to the\r\ntimidity of the cardinal of Lorraine.\r\n\r\n[98] “Les protestans de France se mettans devant les yeux l’example de\r\nleurs voisins.”—Castelnau, Book I, chap. vii.\r\n\r\n[99] La Planche, 237.\r\n\r\n[100] _Ibid._; Castelnau, Book I, chap. viii. The Huguenots did not\r\nintend to take up arms against the person of the King or to force\r\nFrancis II to change the religion of the state. The assertion that\r\nthese were their purposes was an adroit stroke of the Guises (_Rev.\r\nhist._, XIV, 85, 101).\r\n\r\n[101] _Rel. vén._, I, 525.\r\n\r\n[102] Volrad of Mansfeldt and Grumbach, counselor of the elector\r\npalatine, but personal enemies of the cardinal of Lorraine, had\r\nbeen drawn by sympathy into the plan, and on March 4, through their\r\ninfluence, Hotman was received by the elector at Heidelberg, who gave\r\nHotman a letter of credit to the king of Navarre and the prince of\r\nCondé. See Dareste, “Extraits de la correspondance inédite de François\r\nHotman,” _Mém. de l’Académie des sciences morales et politiques_, CIV\r\n(1897), 649.\r\n\r\n[103] After the failure of the conspiracy, during the course of the\r\ninvestigation set on foot by the government, the constable was accused\r\nof complicity in the affair but vigorously denied it in a remonstrance\r\nlaid before the Parlement (La Place, 37, gives a part of the text;\r\nCastelnau, Book II, chap, xi), and while condemning the conspiracy\r\nartfully contrived to imply that the Guises were to be blamed for much\r\n(La Planche, 269). De Thou, II, 778, perhaps reproduces the actual\r\nlanguage of the constable before the Parlement, his father having been\r\npresident of the body at this time. But in the early winter Montmorency\r\nhad visited his lands in Poitou and Angoumois, and his daughter, Madame\r\nde la Tremouille, having quitted his usual place of residence at\r\nChantilly, and traveled in those quarters of France which, it will be\r\nobserved, are identical with those wherein the conspiracy of Amboise\r\nwas hatched (La Place, 32). Is it reasonable to believe that a man\r\nof his political acumen and state of feeling at the time toward the\r\nGuises could have been unaware of at least something of what was in\r\npreparation? The strongest evidence in favor of the innocence of the\r\nconstable is the fact that his two nephews, the cardinal de Châtillon\r\nand the admiral Coligny were undoubtedly without knowledge of the plot.\r\nSee the proofs in Delaborde, _Vie de Coligny_, I, 391-414; D’Aubigné,\r\ned. De Ruble, I, 263, n. 6; Paillard, “Additions critiques à l’histoire\r\nde la conjuration d’Amboise,” _Rev. hist._, XIV (1880), 70, 71. It is\r\nhard, however, to believe that the constable had no information at all\r\nof what was on foot, considering his politics and his movements during\r\nthe winter.\r\n\r\n[104] La Place, 33; Le Laboureur, I, 386, says his first name was Jean.\r\n\r\n[105] _C. S. P. Ven._, No. 137. He had been imprisoned for devising\r\nfalse evidence in a process of law (D’Aubigné, ed. De Ruble, I, 258,\r\nn. 3). La Renaudie is said even to have gone to England to see Queen\r\nElizabeth (Haag, _La France protestante_, I, 259). No reference\r\nis given, but from Hotman’s correspondence (_Acad. des sc. moral.\r\net polit._, CIV [1877], 645) it is evident some one was so sent.\r\nThe further fact that Mundt was approached in Strasburg and French\r\nproclamations printed in England were circulated in Normandy (_C. S. P.\r\nFor._, 954, April 6, 1560) seems to sustain this view.\r\n\r\n[106] La Place, 41; Castelnau, Book I, chap. viii.\r\n\r\n[107] D’Aubigné, Book II, chap, xvii; I, 259-61 gives the names of the\r\nprovincial captains.\r\n\r\n[108] La Planche, 239.\r\n\r\n[109] Mundt, Elizabeth’s agent in Strasburg (he was also agent of the\r\nlandgrave Philip of Hesse), was applied to and “thought that the Queen\r\nwould not be wanting in kind offices. Already it is whispered,” he\r\nwrote, “that there is a great agreement among the nobility and others\r\nthroughout France, who will no longer endure the haughty and adulterous\r\nrule of the Guises, and that some of the first rank in France are\r\ncognizant of the conspiracy who remain quiet; the rest will rise in\r\narms against the Guises.”—_C. S. P. For._, No. 779, February 27, 1560.\r\nCf. _Nég. Tosc._, III, 409.\r\n\r\nAn added element of adventure was the participation of a certain\r\nnobleman of wealth who seems to have financially supported the\r\nconspiracy for self-advantage. This man imagined that the movement\r\nmight be converted into a movement for the recovery of Metz from the\r\nFrench (letter of Hotman to Calvin, September 19, 1559). In Hotman’s\r\neyes, to restore Metz to Germany was to restore it to Protestantism,\r\nbut Calvin was cautious, for his sound policy distinguished between\r\nrebellion and constitutional restriction of tyranny. He sent Beza to\r\nStrasburg to attempt to prevent such an action. But the Senate of\r\nStrasburg seized upon the project, demanded liberty for the Protestants\r\nof Metz and Trèves, abolished the Interim, interdicted the Catholic\r\nreligion, and even expelled the Anabaptists from the city, to the\r\njubilation of radical Protestants, who looked upon it as just reprisal\r\nfor the repressive policy of the Guises in France.\r\n\r\n[110] La Planche, 238.\r\n\r\n[111] La Place, 23; La Planche, 238. Some thirty captains were party\r\nto it who were to be put in command of some companies of German\r\nlansquenets (La Place, 33). “Upward of sixty men, part foreigners and\r\npart native Frenchmen” came to aid the plot (_C. S. P. Ven._, No. 134,\r\nMarch 15, 1560).\r\n\r\n[112] _C. S. P. Ven._, No. 125, March 16, 1560. The correspondence\r\nof the Spanish ambassador testifies to the fact that the Protestant\r\nsoldiery was well paid, the money having been procured by spoliation\r\nof the churches. They gave to each footman 14 francs per month and to\r\neach horseman 16 sous per day.—_Rev. hist._, XIV, 104. The Venetian\r\nambassador says the horsemen got 18 soldi, the footmen 10 daily (_C. S.\r\nP. Ven._, March 17, 1560).\r\n\r\n[113] The Spanish Ambassador puts it upon the 6th. La Planche, Beza,\r\nCastelnau, De Thou, D’Aubigné, La Popelinière, Le Laboureur make\r\nMarch 10 the day. The discrepancy perhaps is to be accounted for by\r\nthe circumstance that Avenelles had said that March 6 was the day\r\ndesignated, but the unexpected removal of the court from Blois to\r\nAmboise (La Place, 33; La Planche, 346) postponed the date of action.\r\nCf. _Rev. hist._, XIV, 66, 85.\r\n\r\n[114] Castelnau, _ibid._; La Planche, 239, 246. The statement is\r\nconfirmed by La Place, 33, 34, and La Planche, 255 who say that the\r\npetition was written in invisible ink and intrusted to one Bigne, a\r\nservant of La Renaudie, who having been captured after the death of his\r\nmaster, in order to save his life, revealed the secret of the document.\r\nThe first article was couched in these terms: “Protestation faicte par\r\nle chef et tous les ceux du conseil de n’attenter aucune autre chose\r\ncontre la Majestie du roy et les princes de son sang. Et estoit le but\r\naussi de la dicte entreprise de faire observer d’ancienne coustume\r\nde la France par une legitime assemblée des estats.”—Tavannes,\r\n247. Tavannes says Bigne directly said that Condé and Coligny were\r\nimplicated. Other incriminating papers were found in the boots of the\r\nbaron Castelnau (_Rev. hist._, XIV, 99, 100; La Planche, 254, 255).\r\n\r\n[115] Castelnau, Book I, chap. xi. De Croze, _Les Guises, les Valois\r\net Philippe II_, I, 60-70 (2 vols., Paris, 1866), shows admirably that\r\nthere is no doubt of the formidable nature of the conspiracy of Amboise.\r\n\r\n[116] It is said that the cardinal and his brother received intimations\r\nof danger from Spain, Italy, Savoy, Germany, and Flanders (La Place\r\n32; Castelnau, Book I, chap, viii) and it is certain that the cardinal\r\nGranvella, Philip’s representative in the Netherlands, warned them. De\r\nThou says that warnings came from Germany, Spain, Italy, and France.\r\nPaillard in _Rev. hist._, XIV, 81, is dubious about an Italian source,\r\nbut it is confirmed by _C. S. P. Ven._, 137, March 6, 1560. He thinks\r\nthat any Spanish source of information was impossible, for the reason\r\nthat Philip II learned everything from Chantonnay. Granvella’s warning\r\nis acknowledged by Chantonnay in a letter of March 3, 1560, to his\r\nbrother. He was expressly told that the aim of the conspiracy was to\r\nmake away with the cardinal of Lorraine and all those of the house of\r\nGuise (_Rev. hist._, XIV, 80, 81). This is supported by the testimony\r\nof the constable and the Venetian ambassador (D’Aubigné, I, 263, n. 3).\r\nIt seems certain that this information was conveyed to the Guises by\r\nFebruary 12 (_Rev. hist._, XIV, 83; _Mém. de Condé_, I, 387; D’Aubigné,\r\nBook II, chap. xvii). Dareste, “François Hotman et la conspiration\r\nd’Amboise,” _Bibliothèque de l’Ecole des Chartes_, sér. III, V,\r\n361, thinks that Hotman’s own indiscreet boasting at Strasburg was\r\nresponsible, at least in part, for the discovery of the plot.\r\n\r\nThe duke of Guise and his brother were in such fear that they wore\r\nshirts of chain mail underneath their vestments, and at night were\r\nguarded by pistoleers and men-at-arms. On the night of March 6, while\r\nat Blois, the alarm was so great that the duke, the cardinal, the\r\ngrand-prior, and all the knights of the order there, watched all night\r\nlong in the courtyard (_C. S. P. For._, No. 837, March 7, 1560).\r\n\r\n[117] Castelnau, Book I, chap, viii; La Planche, 246, 247. He received\r\none hundred écus and a judicial post in Lorraine (De Thou, II, 774, ed.\r\n1740).\r\n\r\n[118] “Among the prisoners was a Gascon gentleman, one baron de\r\nCastelnau, who considering himself ill-used by the cardinal and the\r\nduke of Guise, with many other captains and soldiers, dissatisfied\r\non account of non-payment of their arrears and because they had been\r\ndismissed from the Court, finding themselves without salary or any\r\nother means, and being half desperate, joined the other insurgents\r\nabout religion and conspired against the cardinal and the duke of\r\nGuise.”—_C. S. P. Ven._, No. 135, March 16, 1560. Sancerre had known\r\nCastelnau during the late war, and when he sought to arrest him and\r\nhis companions, they resisted. Although the city of Tours took up\r\narms in the king’s name against them, they made their escape into the\r\nchâteau de Noizay (Indre-et-Loire), between three and four leagues\r\nfrom Amboise, which belonged to the wife of Renay (La Place, 33. She\r\nhad been maid of honor to Jeanne d’Albret, _C. S. P. Ven._, No. 135,\r\nMarch 16, 1560). Cf. _C. S. P. For._, March 21, 1560, and note, on p.\r\n462—the account of Throckmorton. The two versions substantially agree.\r\n\r\n[119] _C. S. P. Ven. For._, March 16, 1560.\r\n\r\n[120] _C. S. P.

Vieilleville was sent to pacify the Beauce and M. de Vassey,\r\nanother knight of the order, to Maune, near Angers, to subdue a\r\ncommotion there (_C. S. P. For._, 902, March 26, 1560).\r\n\r\n[122] His orders at this hour are printed in the _Mém.-journ. du duc de\r\nGuise_, 457; _Mem. de Condé_, I, 342; La Popelinière, I, 166; cf. La\r\nPlanche, 225, who gives the gist of them.\r\n\r\n[123] Lettres-patentes du Roi Francois II au sénéschal de Lyon\r\n“concernans la revelacion de grace que sa Ma^[te] veult faire à ceulx\r\nqui avaient conspiré contre l’estat de la religion et son royaume,”\r\nMarch 17, 1560.\r\n\r\n[124] See the extended account in _C. S. P. Ven._, March 20, 1560;\r\n_Nég. Tosc._, III 412-15.\r\n\r\n[125] His corpse was hanged March 20, 1560, upon a gibbet before the\r\ncourt gate, and left there for two whole days, with an inscription at\r\nhis feet running: “C’est La Renaudie dict la Forest, capitaine des\r\nrebelles, chef et autheur de la sédition” (La Place, 35; D’Aubigné, I,\r\n268, Book II, chap, xvii; _C. S. P. For._, 463, note, March 23, 1560).\r\n\r\n[126] The sentencing to death of prisoners continued daily, several\r\nbeing sent for execution to Blois, Tours, Orleans, and other places,\r\n“that these acts of justice might be witnessed universally and be\r\nbetter known.”\r\n\r\n[127] The instructions of the King are a curious witness of the fury of\r\nthe Guises: “Je vous prye, y estant arrivé, faire si bonne dilligence\r\nque vous les puissiez chastier comme ils méritent, sans avoir aucune\r\npitié ny compassion d’eux.... Aussy je vous envoye des lettres _dont le\r\nnom est en blanc_ et lesquelles vous ferez remplir à votre fantaisie,\r\nque j’escrips aux principaux seigneurs et gentilshommes dudit païs à ce\r\nqu’ils ayent _à assembler leur voysins et vous accompaigner_ en ceste\r\nentreprinse.”—_Négociations relatives au règne de François II_, 342,\r\n343.\r\n\r\n[128] Throckmorton wrote on February 27, 1560: “It is reported that\r\nthe idols have been cast out of the churches throughout Aquitaine and\r\nthat the same would speedily be done in Provence.”—_C. S. P. For._,\r\nNo. 779. Later, on April 14, the Venetian ambassador reports that the\r\ninsurgents in Provence “have stripped the churches, and mutilated the\r\nimages.”—_Ibid._, _Ven._, No. 146. In Dauphiné the achievements of\r\nMontbrun made him famous; see De Thou, Book XXV, 548 ff.\r\n\r\n[129] Chantonnay to the duke of Sessa, March 24, 1560, K. 1,493, No.\r\n45. At St. Malo the insurgents killed certain public officials and\r\nprevented an execution. On March 25 the cardinal of Bourbon went to\r\nRouen; and on the same day there was a sermon in a wood without the\r\ntown to above two thousand people. A priest and a clerk called them\r\nLutherans and cast stones at them, and a riot ensued. Two days after\r\nthe preacher was taken and burned (_C. S. P. For._, 930, March 30,\r\n1560).\r\n\r\n[130] _C. S. P. Ven._, No. 142, March 26, 1560.\r\n\r\n[131] _Ibid._, No. 146, April 4, 1560; _ibid._, _For._, 952, April\r\n6. The cardinal of Lorraine justified the drastic policy of the\r\ngovernment, saying: “It will be more than necessary to apply violent\r\nremedies and proceed to fire and sword, as otherwise, unless provision\r\nbe made, the alienation of this kingdom, coupled with that of Germany\r\nand England and Scotland, would by force draw Spain and Italy and the\r\nrest of Christendom to the same result.”—_Ibid._, _Ven._, No. 142,\r\nMarch 28, 1560.\r\n\r\n[132] The court attended the spectacle of these executions “comme s’il\r\neût été question de voir jouer quelque momerie.”—La Planche, 263.\r\n\r\n[133] Monod, “La jeunesse d’Agrippa d’Aubigné,” _Mém. de l’Acad. de\r\nCaen_, 1884.\r\n\r\n[134] _C. S. P. For._, 1560, Introd. Hotman vented his disappointment\r\nat the failure of the conspiracy and his wrath because of the cruel\r\npolicy of the Guises in a famous pamphlet directed against the cardinal\r\nof Lorraine. It bore the significant title “Le Tigre.” See De Thou,\r\nBook XXV, 512; Weill, 40, 98, Asse, “Un pamphlet en 1560,” _Revue de\r\nFrance_, January 1876, and Dareste, _Mém. de l’Acad. des sc. moral.\r\net polit._, CIV (1877), 605. Hotman’s authorship of it remained\r\nundiscovered for years. A counselor named Du Lyon, believed to be the\r\nauthor of it, a printer named Martin, and a merchant of Rouen, who had\r\nsponsored it, were hanged in the Place Maubert (Castelnau, Book I,\r\nchap, xi; La Planche, 312, 313; La Place, 76, 77).\r\n\r\nIn 1875 M. Charles Read published this famous pamphlet in facsimile\r\nfrom the only existing copy which was rescued from the burning of\r\nthe Hôtel-de-Ville in 1871. The text is accompanied with historical,\r\nliterary, and bibliographical notes.\r\n\r\n[135] The baggage of the prince of Condé was opened, it being expected\r\nto find therein letters or other writings relating to the conspiracy,\r\nand although excuses were made after the search, attributing it to\r\nthieves, yet as none of the contents were missing, the belief greatly\r\nprevailed of the search having been made for that purpose (_C. S. P.\r\nVen._, No. 178, 1560).\r\n\r\nOn March 22 the prince of Condé was confronted with one of the\r\ncondemned conspirators, but to the discomfiture of his enemies, no\r\nevidence against the prince could be elicited (_C. S. P. For._, No.\r\n919, March 29 1560).\r\n\r\n[136] La Planche, 267.\r\n\r\n[137] Castelnau, Book I, chap. xi.\r\n\r\n[138] La Planche, 268.\r\n\r\n[139] May 6, 1560, Navarre to Throckmorton: “Has received a letter\r\nenclosing a proclamation of the Queen in which he sees it intimated\r\nthat the princes and estates of France are to call her to their aid.

S. P. For._, No. 992, April 12, 1560. The unfortunate baron\r\nCastelnau, in view of the fact that he was a knight of the order, was\r\nat first sentenced to the galleys for three years, but later, at the\r\ninstance of the Guises, was condemned to die and was beheaded on March\r\n29, along with the captain Mazères, the duke of Nemours, the baron’s\r\ncaptor, being absolved from keeping his promise to spare his life (_C.\r\nS. P. For._, No. 952, April 6, 1560; La Planche, 264, 265; La Place,\r\n34; D’Aubigné, 268-70, Book II, chap. xvii). One of the most prominent\r\nof those arrested was the Scotchman, Robert Stuart, who had already\r\nbeen suspected of the murder of President Minard, and who claimed to\r\nbe a relative of Mary Stuart. He was imprisoned in the Conciergerie\r\nand put to torture, but would admit nothing. It was he who shot the\r\nconstable Montmorency on the battlefield of St. Denis. Stuart had the\r\nreputation of being able to make bullets, called Stuardes, which would\r\npierce a cuirass. He himself was killed in turn at the battle of Jarnac\r\nby the marquis of Villars, count of Tende, who stabbed him with a\r\ndagger (_Rev. hist._, XIV, 93; Forneron, _Histoire des ducs de Guise_,\r\nII, 92).\r\n\r\n[144] “A conspiracy to kill them both and then to take the King and\r\ngive him masters and governors to bring him up in this wretched\r\ndoctrine,” is the way the cardinal of Lorraine and his brother\r\ndescribed it to the dowager queen of Scotland in a letter of March 20,\r\n1560 (_C. S. P. For._, No. 870).\r\n\r\nThe King’s circular letter to the Parlements, bailiffs, and seneschals\r\nof the kingdom on March 30 declared that the conspirators “s’estoyent\r\naidés de certains predicans venus de Genève.”—_Mem. de Condé_, I, 398.\r\n\r\n[145] “It had been well if the Guises had not been so particularly\r\nnamed as the occasion of these unquietnesses, but that it had run in\r\ngeneral terms,” wrote Throckmorton to Cecil (_C. S. P. For._, No. 954,\r\nApril 6, 1560). Chantonnay advised the queen mother that, in order to\r\navoid further difficulty, it was expedient for the Guises to retire\r\nfrom court for a season (La Place, 38).\r\n\r\n[146] La Planche, 219, 20.\r\n\r\n[147] Tavannes actually says she was privy to the conspiracy of\r\nAmboise, p. 247. During the reign of Henry II, Catherine de Medici\r\nhad had no political influence. She was hated as an Italian (_Rel.\r\nvén._, I, 105). On one occasion only did she assert herself; “En 1557,\r\nà la nouvelle du désastre de Saint-Quentin, qui ouvrait à l’Espagne\r\nles portes de la France, il y eut un moment d’indicible panique.\r\nHommes d’état, hommes de guerre, tous avaient perdu la tête. Par un\r\nhasard heureux, Catherine se trouvait à Paris; seule elle conserva son\r\nsang-froid, et, de sa propre initiative, courant en l’hôtel-de-ville et\r\nau parlement, et s’y montrant si éloquente et énergetique, elle arracha\r\naux échevins et aux membres du parlement un large subside et rendit du\r\ncœur à la grande ville.”—La Ferrière “L’entrevue de Bayonne,” _R.

Shortly before the death of Henry\r\nII, Coligny had sought to resign his government, wishing to retain\r\nonly his office of admiral but Henry refused to accept the resignation\r\n(Delaborde, I, 362). Coligny then endeavored to have his government of\r\nPicardy given to his nephew, the prince of Condé (_Rev. hist._, XIV,\r\n74). Meanwhile he continued to hold the office of governor to prevent\r\nthe Guises getting control of it (La Planche, 216). Finally in January,\r\n1560, the admiral again went to court to present his resignation, and\r\nat the same time to urge the appointment of his nephew. This time it\r\nwas accepted, and the prince of Condé was appointed to the post (La\r\nPlanche, 217; _Rev. hist._, XIV, 74, 75).\r\n\r\n[149] La Place, 36; _C. S. P.

The term “interim” was\r\ntechnically applied to a resolution of the sovereign, with or without\r\nthe approbation of the diet or the estates of the country. By such an\r\nedict religious affairs were regulated provisionally, pending a final\r\nsettlement by a general council of the church. The practice first\r\nobtained in Germany, where Charles V issued such a decree in favor of\r\nthe Lutherans in 1548. See _Rev. hist._, XIV, 76, 77. “In modo che,\r\nrestando ciascuno d’allora in dietro assicurato dalla paura che avea\r\nper innanzi, di poter esser inquisito, questo si può dir che fosse uno\r\ntacito _interim_.”—_Rel. vén._, I, 414.\r\n\r\n[154] “La reyne mère du roy, monstrant une bonne affection à l’admiral,\r\nle pria de la conseiller et l’advertir par lettres, souvent, de tous\r\nles moyens qu’il sçauvoit et pourroit apprendre d’appaiser les troubles\r\net séditions du royaume.”—Castelnau, Book I, chap. xi.

The vidame of Chartres\r\nwas cousin-german of Maligny, suspected in the Amboise conspiracy. The\r\nvidame not having any children, Maligny and his brother were his sole\r\nheirs. The comte de Bastard has written a biography of him, _Vie de\r\nJean de Ferrières, vidame de Chartres_, Auxerre, 1885.\r\n\r\n[187] _C. S. P.

The brothers met on June 25 (Rochambeau, _Lettres d’Antoine de\r\nBourbon et de Jeanne d’Albret_, 202). In his journey he inveighed\r\nagainst the usurpation of the Guises, and found a hearing from the\r\nnoblesse and gentlemen of the south, who urged him and his brother to\r\nassume the place to which their rank entitled them. The Guises were\r\nkept informed of this journey of the prince by the marshal St. André,\r\nwho, under pretense of visiting his brothers, kept watch of Condé\r\n(La Planche, 314, 315; La Place, 53). The discovery of the plot was\r\nowing to the suspicious vigilance of the duke of Guise, who marked a\r\nBasque gentleman who appeared in Paris as a stranger bent on important\r\nbusiness, and surmised that he had been sent by the king of Navarre.\r\nIt was noticed that he had conferred with the vidame of Chartres, and\r\nso, “as he was returning ... to ... Navarre, the duke of Guise had him\r\nand his valises, with (his) letters and writings, seized at Etampes. In\r\nthe valise many letters were found, said to have been addressed both\r\nto the king of Navarre and to his brother, the prince of Condé. Among\r\nthem were letters of the constable and his son, Montmorency, though\r\nthey were merely letters of ceremony; but those of importance were what\r\nthe vidame wrote to the prince, part in cipher and part without.”—_C.\r\nS.

The vidame of Chartres was arrested on August 29, 1560,\r\nby the provost-marshal and the lieutenant-criminal, at his lodgings in\r\nParis, and carried through the streets upon a mule, “with a great rout\r\nof armed men to the Bastille.”—_C. S. P. For._, No. 483, September 3,\r\n1560. Castelnau, Book II, chap, vii, says that the letters promised\r\nto assist the prince of Condé against all persons whatsoever except\r\nthe King and the royal family. The Venetian ambassador says that\r\nthere was enough in them “clearly to indicate that for many months\r\nthere had been an intrigue.”—_Ibid._, _Ven._, No. 193, August 30,\r\n1560. On the other hand, Throckmorton asserts that “the substance of\r\nthe letter sent by the vidame to the king of Navarre is said to be\r\nso wisely written that it is thought that nothing can be laid to his\r\ncharge.”—_Ibid._, _For._, No. 502, September 8, 1560. He was examined\r\nby the archbishop of Vienne and the president De Thou.

His ambition was\r\nto become a sort of French pope, so that “he would not have thought\r\nit wrong had all obedience to the pontiff ceased.”—_Despatches of\r\nSuriano_ (Huguenot Society), September 23, 1560.\r\n\r\n[211] Maynier, _Etude historique sur le concile de Trente (1545-62)_,\r\n1874; _Journal du concile de Trente, redigé par un secrétaire vénitien\r\nprésent aux sessions de 1562 à 1563, et publié par Armand Baschet, avec\r\nd’autres documents diplomatiques relatifs à la mission des Ambassadeurs\r\nde France au concile_; Desjardins, _Le pouvoir civil au concile de\r\nTrente_, Paris, 1869; Baguenault de la Puchesse, “Le concile de\r\nTrente,” _R.

When the Pope showed\r\nanger at the determination of France, the cardinal of Lorraine actually\r\napologized for himself by saying that it was neither by his orders nor\r\nwith his consent, but that the printers took the liberty to give the\r\nname of National Council to the “Congregation” which the King intended\r\nto convoke! (_ibid._, No. 174, 1560).\r\n\r\n[214] _Ibid._, No. 569, September 8, 1560.\r\n\r\n[215] _Ibid._, No. 615, October 8, 1560. The demands of the Protestants\r\nwere as follows: (1) That the Council be convened in a free city of\r\nGermany; (2) that summons be not by a papal bull, but by the Emperor,\r\nwho should provide them with safe-conducts; (3) that the Pope be\r\nsubordinated to the Council; (4) that those of the Confession of\r\nAugsburg have a vote equally with the Catholics; (5) that the judgment\r\nbe according to the Holy Scriptures, and not according to the decrees\r\nof the Pope; (6) that the prelates of the Council be absolved from the\r\noath by which they are bound to the Pope and the Church of Rome; (7)\r\nthat the acts of the Council of Trent be annulled (cf. _C. S. P. For._,\r\nNo. 782, sec. 14).\r\n\r\n[216] “A general council is necessary for abolishing these heresies;\r\nbut ... especial care must be taken with the Emperor and the kings of\r\nFrance and Spain to decide what shall be settled therein.”—_C. S. P.\r\nFor._, No. 416, August 13, 1560, from Strasburg.\r\n\r\n[217] The Vatican understanding was that the former Council of Trent\r\nwas to be _continued_; although in the bull the word continuation was\r\nnot made use of, as in that of the jubilee, a show of deference thereby\r\nbeing made to the Emperor and the French King, who had demanded a new\r\ncouncil. But the French government although it allowed the place, did\r\nnot allow the continuation of the former Council of Trent convened\r\nby Paul III. For if it accepted the council as it was published by\r\nthe bull, it would have had to accept all the articles which had been\r\nconcluded in the former council. When it was argued that Philip II\r\nwas satisfied with the continuation, Francis II replied that although\r\ncontinuation might suffice for the needs of his dominions, it would not\r\ndo for France, the more so because Henry II of France having caused\r\nprotest to be made in Trent of the nullity of that council, from its\r\nnot having been free, his son could not think well of the continuation.\r\n(The reply of Francis II to Philip II, October, 1560, is in Paris,\r\n_Négociations_, 615-22. Cf. also the luminous accounts of Elizabeth’s\r\nagent in Venice, Guido Gianetti, _C. S. P. For._, No. 782, December 7,\r\n1560; No. 815, December 21, 1560; and the dispatch of Throckmorton to\r\nthe queen, of December 31, 1560, giving an account of a conversation\r\nwith the king of Navarre, No. 832, §7.) In the reply made to Philip\r\nin October, 1560, the French King declared that, by the advice of his\r\ncouncil, he had resolved upon an assembly of his prelates, from which\r\nnothing was to be feared for the apostolic see, it being intended only\r\nto provide the necessary remedies, and that it would not be a hindrance\r\nbut rather an aid to the General Council, for when it came to open,\r\nthe French prelates would be already assembled and “well informed as\r\nwell of the evil as of the remedy,” and that when the Council at Trent\r\nshould have once begun, it would put an end to the lesser assembly. As\r\nto the place of the council, the French at first preferred to have it\r\nmeet in one of the Rhenish towns between Constance and Cologne, or at\r\nBesançon in Burgundy, which belonged to Philip II; later, in the answer\r\nto Don Antonio and in his letters to Rome, Francis II agreed to accept\r\nwhatever place the Emperor and the Pope decided upon.\r\n\r\nThe new session of the Council of Trent was to be preceded by a general\r\njubilee, giving power to confessors to absolve from all sins, _even\r\nfrom that of having read prohibited books_. The bull warmly exhorted\r\nthe extirpation of heresy. This jubilee was first celebrated at Rome,\r\non Sunday, November 24, 1560, by a procession, with the Pope walking at\r\nits head (_C. S. P. For._, No. 782, §§ 15, 16).\r\n\r\n[218] La Place, 114; _C. S. P.

Don Antonio arrived at the French court on\r\nSeptember 23, and departed four days later (_C. S. P. For._, 619, Oct.\r\n10, 1560). Philip II took the ground that any discussion looking toward\r\nthe reformation of religion would not only imperil the faith, but\r\nprejudice his policy in Spain and the Netherlands; for if France should\r\nalter anything, he feared it would cause a schism universally (_ibid._,\r\nNo. 619, Oct. 10, 1560). The growth of the reformation in Spain alone\r\nwas already quite great enough to alarm him. In the early autumn of\r\n1559, Miranda, the archbishop of Toledo, the archbishop of Seville, and\r\ntwelve of “the most famous and best-learned religious men” in Spain\r\nhad been arrested for heresy (_ibid._, No. 133, October 25, 1559), and\r\nat this time the inquisitors had just laid their hands on the brother\r\nof the admiral of Spain (_ibid._, No. 619, October 10, 1560). On this\r\nwhole subject see Weiss, _The Spanish Reformers_, and Wiffen, _Life\r\nand Writings of Juan de Valdés_, 1865. Montluc accused Jeanne d’Albret\r\nof printing Calvinist catechisms and the New Testament in Spanish, in\r\nBasque, and in Béarnais, and of secretly distributing them in Spain by\r\ncolporteurs (La Ferrière, _Blaise de Montluc_, 61).\r\n\r\n[221] Paris, _Négociations_, 495; Forneron, _Histoire de Philippe II_,\r\nI, 225.

After the departure of Don\r\nAntonio, Catherine wrote a letter to Philip II, thanking him for the\r\noffer (_Correspondance de Catherine de Médicis_, I, 149).\r\n\r\nThe Venetian ambassador is particular and says he offered to put 3,500\r\ntroops in Flanders at the disposal of France, to place 2,000 infantry\r\nnear Narbonne, and another 4,000 near Bayonne, besides “a large body\r\nof Spanish cavalry.”—_C.

Castelnau, Book II, chap.\r\nx, says the change was made because the Huguenots were numerous\r\naround Meaux (but so were they also around Orleans), and fear lest\r\nanother conspiracy might be formed by having the place known so long\r\nin advance. A rumor was current that the Huguenots were planning to\r\nsurprise it. I believe the real reason to be the more central location\r\nof Orleans.\r\n\r\n[238] “On his arrival with his brethren, the cardinal of Bourbon and\r\nthe prince of Condé, the prince was taken before the Council who\r\ncommitted him prisoner to MM. de Bressey and Chauverey, two captains,\r\nwith 200 archers.

The\r\narticles reflect the state of the times (_C. S. P. For._, No. 681). In\r\nconnection with this authentic petition compare the imaginary “discours\r\ndu drapier” in a fancied meeting of the estates-general, as given in\r\n_Livre des marchands_, 427-40, the satirical forerunner of the greatest\r\npolitical satire of the sixteenth century, the _Satyre Menippée_.\r\n\r\n[256] La Planche, 260.\r\n\r\n[257] Cf.

Part of\r\nit was held by the Swiss cantons: “The French King is conferring\r\nwith the Swiss about paying his debts, and offers two-thirds with a\r\nquarter for interest, and to pay the whole within three years; which\r\nconditions they refuse, and desire him either to stand to his written\r\npromises or that the matter shall be discussed in some place appointed\r\nin Switzerland.”—_C.

S. P. For._, No. 738, November 28, 1560; Chantonnay to\r\nPhilip II, same date, K. 1,493, No. 108. He fell ill about November\r\n20, seemingly with a catarrh (Suriano, November 20, 25), accompanied\r\nby headache and pain in the ear, of which he died on the night of\r\nDecember 5 at the eleventh hour, although the physicians, on December\r\n1, “mistrusted no danger of his life” (_C. S. P. For._, No. 758).\r\nThrockmorton elsewhere calls the King’s disease “an impostume in the\r\nhead.”—_Ibid._, No. 771, December 6, 1560; cf. La Planche, 413, 418;\r\nD’Aubigné, I, 299. Very probably the disease was _mastoiditis_—an\r\naffection of the mastoid bone back of the ear, induced by chronic\r\ncatarrh which finally affected the brain. Suriano says: “Il corpo del\r\nmorto Re è stato aperto et hanno trovato guasto tutto il cervello, in\r\nmodo che per diligentia delli medici non si haveria potuto risanarlo”\r\n(December 8, 1560.)\r\n\r\n[269] D’Aubigné, I, 300, and n. 2. The vidame of Chartres, who had\r\nbeen confined in the Bastille, “though allowed to take the air” (_C.\r\nS. P. For._, No. 764, December 3, 1560), was released also, but died\r\nalmost immediately (La Place, 78-79, gives a eulogy of him). See\r\nLemoisne, “François de Vendôme, vidame de Chartes,” _Positions de\r\nthèses de l’Ecole des Chartes_, 1901, 89. His death enriched the house\r\nof Montmorency, for he left the lordship of Milly-en-Gatinois, worth\r\n3,000 crowns yearly, to Damville, the constable’s second son (_C. S. P.\r\nFor._, No. 832, §10, December 31, 1560). The will is printed in _Bib.\r\nde l’Ec. d. Chartes_, 1849, 342; it is dated December 23.\r\n\r\n[270] _Rel. vén._, I, 543.

S. P. For._, No. 771,\r\nDecember 6, 1560. Catherine de Medici detested Mary Stuart. She called\r\nher “notre petite reinette écossaise.”\r\n\r\n[276] Claude Haton, I, 118, 119. The Guises wanted, above all, to\r\nprevent the _undivided_ regency of Catherine de Medici and even cited\r\nthe Salic law as a bar to such result (Chantonnay to Philip II,\r\nDecember 28, 1560; K. 1,494, No. 12). They favored the regency of the\r\npliable Antoine of Bourbon, or a combination of the king of Navarre\r\nand the queen mother. In either event a galaxy of the Guises was to\r\nsurround the throne, I. e., the cardinals of Tournon and Lorraine, the\r\nduke of Guise, the chancellor and the two marshals Brissac and St.\r\nAndré; cf. _Nég. Tosc._, III, 434, and De Crue, _Anne de Montmorency_,\r\n288-90, a good brief statement.\r\n\r\n[277] Catherine sent the sieur de Lansac at once to the constable at\r\nEtampes (cf. D’Aubigné, I, 299, and n. 2) who in turn went to consult\r\nwith his son, Damville, at Chantilly, where he was kept by his wife’s\r\nillness, those two in turn conferring with the princess of Condé (La\r\nPlace, 76).\r\n\r\n[278] _Despatches of Suriano_ (Huguenot Society), December 18, 1560.\r\n\r\n[279] How much Antoine yielded to the temptation the following report\r\nof an interview between Throckmorton and the king of Navarre shows:\r\n“Throckmorton said that there was a _bruit_ that the Spaniards had\r\npassage given them by Bayonne and other forts of the French King. The\r\nking of Navarre said that it was true, and that he was about to verify\r\nthe letters that are yet denied.”—_C. S. P. For._, No. 732, December\r\n31, 1560, § 7.\r\n\r\nOn Sardinia see _Rel. vén._, I, 555. Even the prospect of becoming\r\nemperor was held out to him (_ibid._, I, 559; II, 76).\r\n\r\n[280] “Although the duke of Guise is popular, above all with the\r\nnobility, yet everybody so detests the cardinal of Lorraine that if\r\nthe matter depended upon universal suffrage, not only could he have no\r\npart in the government, but perhaps not in the world! It is cynically\r\nreported that his Right Reverend and Lordship took the precaution to\r\nsend his favorite and precious effects early into Lorraine.”—_C. S. P.\r\nVen._, No. 221, December 16, 1560.\r\n\r\n[281] _Despatches of Suriano_ (Huguenot Society), December 18, 1560;\r\n_Rel. vén._, I, 433. “I found the court very much altered ... not one\r\nof the house of Guise.”—_C. S. P. For._, No. 832, December 31, 1560.\r\n\r\n[282] Claude Haton, I, 11.\r\n\r\n[283] The law of France, by ordinance of Charles V, had for generations\r\nprovided that the king’s majority was attained when he was fourteen\r\nyears of age; but the King’s uncles claimed that the meaning of the law\r\nwas that the King’s majority was not reached _until the end_ of his\r\nfourteenth year, i. e., upon his _fifteenth_ birthday, which, in the\r\ncase of Charles IX, would not be until June 27, 1564. This ingenious\r\nargument was sustained by various authors subsidized by the Guises,\r\nwho went farther and argued away the regency of the queen mother also,\r\nin spite of the precedents of Blanche of Castille and Anne of Beaujeu,\r\non the ground of the Salic law (Chantonnay to Philip II, December 28,\r\n1560; K. 1,494, No. 12).\r\n\r\n[284] D’Aubigné, I, 302; _Correspondance de Catherine de Médicis_, I,\r\n176; _Despatches of Suriano_ (Huguenot Society), March 29, 1561; _C.\r\nS.

Viollet, _Inst. polit. de la France_, II, 95.\r\n\r\n[286] The arrangement of executive offices at this time was very\r\ndifferent from that of a modern government. Instead of there being a\r\nsingle secretary for foreign affairs, there were individual secretaries\r\n_for each country_—one for Italy, one for Spain, one for Flanders,\r\none for Germany, etc., and each one attended to his own business. This\r\neliminated one more power in the government, exactly as Catherine\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n[287] _Despatches of Suriano_ (Huguenot Society), March 29, 1561.\r\n“The King is young and the constable has now a great authority in the\r\nrealm.... But if they recover their authority, it is to be feared that\r\nthey will use more extremity than they did before, and that therefore\r\nthe queen cannot but fear his danger in this case.”—_C. S. P.

In this connection the following\r\nobservation is of interest: “A disputation has lately been at Rome\r\namong the cardinals, and the Pope has had the hearing of what is the\r\ncause that France is thus rebelled from them. The Romans would conclude\r\nthat the dissolute living of the French cardinals, bishops and clergy,\r\nwas the cause; but the French party and the bishop, who is ambassador\r\nthere, say that nothing has wrought so much in France as of late\r\nthe practice in Rome of divers of the nobility of France where they\r\nhave seen such dissolute living of the clergymen as returning into\r\nFrance they have persuaded the rest that the clergy of Rome is of no\r\nreligion.”—_C.

The action\r\npractically flouted a papal bull of November 20, 1560, convening the\r\nCouncil at Trent, which was intended to anticipate and _prevent_ any\r\nsuch action as this at Orleans (La Planche, 403).\r\n\r\n[302] There was also a technical argument based on the fact that in the\r\nbull of the Council the words “_sublata suspensione_” were interpreted\r\nto mean that the Pope intended to continue the Council already\r\ncommenced, and that the decrees already made were to be valid; which\r\noffended France. The cardinal of Lorraine was the one who raised these\r\ndifficulties, though he tried to give the opposite impression; from him\r\ncame the opposition to the words of the bull (_C. S. P.

Vührer, _Histoire de la dette\r\npublique en France_, I, 15-26; Lavisse, _Histoire de France_, V, Part\r\nI, 241, 242.\r\n\r\n[312] Esmein, _Histoire du droit français_, 631-34.\r\n\r\n[313] Vührer, _Histoire de la dette publique en France_, I, 22-25.\r\n\r\n[314] Gold was at a premium, the payments for gold crowns and pistolets\r\nbeing above their valuation. All foreign coins were rated high: English\r\n“rose” nobles = 6 francs, 12 sous; “angels” = 4 francs, 6 sous;\r\nimperials and Phillipes were current at the same rate as “angels” (_C.\r\nS. P. For._, No. 1,076, February 20, 1561). The gold crown was passable\r\nat 51 francs _tournois_; the pistolet gold and weight, 49 francs\r\n(_ibid._, No. 886, January 17, 1561). Prices of commodities were also\r\nhigh. The duke of Bedford, who came over in February 1561 as a special\r\nenvoy of Elizabeth, reports, February 26: “France is the dearest\r\ncountry I ever came in.”—_Ibid._, No. 1,031. Cf. the confession of\r\nRichard Sweete, an English fugitive in France, who was forced to return\r\nhome on account of “hard times.” “Within one month they came back from\r\nParis, partly upon the death of the French king and partly for that\r\nvictuals were there so dear that they could not live.”—_Ibid._, II,\r\nNo. 36, October 5, 1559.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to go at length into the intricate subject of the\r\nvarious kinds of money current in France in the sixteenth century,\r\nsomething yet is to be said upon the subject in order to make clear the\r\nworking of these and other economic sources. In the sixteenth century,\r\nas during the Middle Ages, the standard of value was the _livre\r\ntournois_, divided into _sous_ and _deniers_ (1 livre = 20 sous; 1 sou\r\n= 12 deniers). The _livre tournois_ was really a hypothetical coin and\r\nwas merely used as a unit of calculation. The French gold coin was\r\nthe _écu d’or_ which varied in value between 1 livre, 16 sous, and 2\r\nlivres, 5 sous. In 1561 it was equivalent to 2 livres in round numbers.\r\nThe _teston_ was a silver coin of a value of 10 or 11 sous and was\r\nsometimes called a crown or a franc by the English. The sou originally\r\nwas made of an amalgam of silver and copper and the denier or penny of\r\nred copper.\r\n\r\nThe English during their long occupation of Normandy in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and owing to their commercial communication with Flanders,\r\nintroduced the pound sterling or “estrelin” (easterling) (Du Cange,\r\n_Glossarium_, _s. v._ “Esterlingus;” Ruding, _Annals of the Coinage_,\r\nI, 7; Le Blanc, _Traité historique des monnaies de France_, 82).\r\nThough much more stable than other coinage—except the Venetian ducat\r\nand the florin—it nevertheless slowly depreciated. Elizabeth in 1561\r\nrechristened it the gold “sovereign.” It was worth about 8 _livres\r\ntournois_ in 1561 (Avenel, “La fortune mobilière dans l’histoire,”\r\n_Revue des deux mondes_, July 15, 1892, 784, 785). The French peasantry\r\nstill in certain parts of France estimate in terms of ancient coinage.\r\nThe _pistole_, by origin a Spanish coin current in Flanders and the\r\nMilanais, was forbidden circulation as far back as Louis XIV. Yet the\r\npeasants of Lower Normandy at the cattle fairs today will estimate the\r\nprice of their animals in ancient terms. Similarly the Breton peasantry\r\ntalk of _réaux_ (_real_), the last vestige of Brittany’s commercial\r\nrelations with Spain (Avenel, _op. cit._, 783).\r\n\r\nThe actual value of these coins in modern terms has been much debated.\r\nM. de Wailly estimated the value of the _livre tournois_ in 1561 at\r\n3 francs, 78 centimes. The vicomte d’Avenel thinks these figures too\r\nhigh and has adopted 3 francs, 11 centimes as a mean value for the\r\nyears between 1561 and 1572. M. Lavasseur prefers the round number of 3\r\nfrancs. On the basis of the last estimate one sou would be equivalent\r\nto 15 centimes and 1 denier to 1.2 centimes in terms of modern French\r\nmoney. But these figures mean nothing until the purchasing power of\r\nmoney at this time is established. In this particular, estimates have\r\nvaried all the way from 3 to 12 and even to 17 and 20. M. Lemmonier\r\ninclines to the ratio of 5 for the middle of the sixteenth century. For\r\nan admirably clear and succinct account of the value of French money\r\nin the sixteenth century, see Lavisse, _Histoire de France_, Vol. V,\r\nPart I, pp. 266-69. Larger references will be found in the bibliography\r\nappended to the chapter.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the ratio may have been, the decline in the purchasing\r\npower of money was great. Between 1492 and 1544 Europe imported 279\r\nmillions worth (in francs) of gold and silver. In the single year 1545,\r\nwhen the famous mines of Potosi were opened, 492,000,000 francs’ worth\r\nwere brought into Europe. The purchasing power of money is estimated\r\nto have fallen one-quarter between 1520 and 1540 and one-half by the\r\nyear 1600. After the peace of Cateau-Cambrésis when peaceful relations\r\nwere renewed between France and Spain, France particularly felt the\r\ndisturbing effect of the new conditions. According to the vicomte\r\nd’Avenel (_op. cit._), from 1541-61 the _livre tournois_ was valued\r\nat 3 francs, 34 centimes; from 1561-72 at 3 francs, 11 centimes; from\r\n1575-79 at 2 francs, 88 centimes. “Un capital de 1,000 livres qui\r\nvalait 22,000 francs en 1200, n’en valait plus intrinsèquement que\r\n16,000 en 1300; 7,530 en 1400; 6,460 en 1500, et était tombé en 1600 à\r\n2,570 francs.”—_Revue des deux mondes_, July 15, 1892, 800.\r\n\r\nOne is astonished not to find greater complaints about the “hard times”\r\nin the chronicles and other sources of the period. To be sure, the\r\nmisery did not reach its acutest stage until the time of the League,\r\nwhen the difference between the price of food stuffs and daily wages\r\nwas outrageous. For example, since 1500 the wage of the laboring\r\nman had increased but 30 per cent., whereas the price of grain had\r\nincreased 400 per cent. At the accession of Louis XII, wheat had cost\r\nfour francs per hectolitre and the peasant earned sixteen centimes a\r\nday; at the accession of Henry IV (in 1590), wheat sold for twenty\r\nfrancs per hectolitre and the daily wage of the peasant was but\r\nseventy-eight centimes (Avenel, “Le pouvoir de l’argent,” _Revue des\r\ndeux mondes_, April 15, 1892, 838).\r\n\r\n[315] Castelnau, Book III, chap. ii.\r\n\r\n[316] La Planche, 112; _C.

In pursuance of this legislation the cardinal of\r\nLorraine resigned a few of his pluralities. He gave the bishopric\r\nof Metz to his brother, the cardinal of Guise, and retained for\r\nhimself the archbishopric of Rheims, with the Abbeys of St. Rémy\r\nand St. Denis (Claude Haton, I, 234). On April 1, 1561, the action\r\nof the States-General was affirmed in a royal edict which commanded\r\nthe bishops to return to their dioceses and there reside under pain\r\nof seizure of their temporalities, and in every bailiwick in France\r\ninventories were to be made of the whole revenues of the priest\r\n(Isambert, XIV, 101). It was followed by an edict dealing with the\r\nadministration of the hospitals and support of the poor (_ibid._, 105),\r\ndesigned to put an end to corrupt practice on the part of unprincipled\r\nand avaricious priests who did not wish to reside at home and so sold\r\ntheir cures to presbyters. Those who had numerous benefices found\r\nmeans to excuse themselves from residence in their cures, in virtue\r\nof an article of the edict, which provided that ecclesiastics who had\r\nnumerous cures, which they held _par dispense_, or other benefices\r\nor charges requiring actual residence in some other church, and who\r\ncould not by this means reside in their parishes, by residing in one\r\nof the parishes or other churches in which they had a benefice or\r\noffice requiring residence, were exempt from residing in their other\r\ncures, provided that they committed them to the care of capable vicars.\r\nIn virtue of this article they were permitted the enjoyment of their\r\nrevenues after having satisfied the king’s officers in each bailiwick.\r\nCf. Claude Haton, I, 221, 222. The revenues of hospitals were assumed\r\ncontrol of by the government, and the administration thereof was\r\ncommitted to the care of special administrators. Local judicial\r\nofficers instead of the clergy, as formerly, were to supervise the\r\ndistribution of money, wood, wine, and provisions, to priors, monks,\r\nnuns, and the poor.\r\n\r\nThe hospitals of various towns of France and in particular the\r\nhôtels-dieu at Paris and Troyes, had already, even before this, been\r\ngoverned by lay commissioners. For a complaint of bad administration of\r\nthe Hôtel-Dieu at Provins by the lay officers, who enriched themselves\r\nat the expense of the poor, and let the house run down, for which\r\nreason the King was requested to restore the administration to the\r\nclergy, see Claude Haton, I, 223.\r\n\r\n[332] The letter which the bishop of Limoges, the French ambassador in\r\nMadrid, wrote “après la mort de François II,” detailing the Spanish\r\nmonarch’s fear, is almost prophetic (Paris, _Négociations relatives au\r\nrègne de François II_, 782-85).\r\n\r\n[333] Philip II, to Charles IX, January 4, 1561, K. 1,495, No. 13; to\r\nMary Stuart, January 7, K. 1,495, No. 17; _C.

His correspondence\r\nabounds with allusions to Sardinia, e. g., 17, 25, 35, 37, 79, 83, 84,\r\n90, etc.\r\n\r\n[377] In the presence of the king of Navarre, the constable, the dukes\r\nof Guise, Nevers, Montpensier, and Aumale, and of spiritual lords, the\r\ncardinal of Lorraine, who was archbishop of Rheims, and the bishops\r\nof Laon, Langres, Châlons, Noyon, and Beauvais, the last being the\r\ncardinal Châtillon, the only prominent Huguenot, who attended the\r\ncoronation. The prince of Condé, the admiral, the duke de Longueville,\r\nthe marshal Montmorency, and his brother Damville, were not present,\r\nbecause they would not assist at mass (“M. Damville is the constable’s\r\nbest-beloved son, a Knight of the Order, one of the paragons of the\r\ncourt and a favourer of the reformed faith.”—_C. S. P. For._, No.\r\n395, §3, August 11, 1561). For a detailed account of the particulars\r\nand party issues manifested at the ceremony see De Crue, 309, 310,\r\nCatherine de Medici apparently took her time to advise Philip II of the\r\ncoronation, for her letter (without date) was not received by the King\r\nuntil June 17, K. 1,494, No. 44.\r\n\r\n[378] This mightily offended the Triumvirate, and the duke of Guise,\r\nthe constable, and the marshal St. André forthwith left the court in\r\nhigh dudgeon.\r\n\r\nRochambeau, _Lettres d’Antoine de Bourbon et de Jeanne d’Albret_,\r\nInventaire Sommaire, No. CXLIII, 27 juin 1561—“Attestation de\r\nCatherine de Médicis et Antoine de Bourbon, pour affirmer que la\r\nretraite du duc du Guyse, de conestable de Montmorency, et du mareschal\r\nde St. André n’est due qu’au seul respect et affection qu’ils portent\r\nau service du roi et au repos de ses sujets.”—Bib.

Suriano pithily observes: “Con questi dispareri le\r\ncose del Regno patiscono assai, et non si può far niuna deliberatione\r\nd’importanza che sia ferma et rissoluta, et di quà hanno havuto\r\norigine tanti editti nel fatto di Religione che sono stati publicati\r\nli mesi passati, li quali non solamente sono ambigui, ma diversi l’uno\r\ndall’altro et spesse volte contrarii, donde li heretici hanno preso\r\ntanto fomento che sono fatti più indurati et più ostinati che mai”\r\n(June 26, 1561).\r\n\r\nCharles IX sent the Sieur d’Ozances to Spain to soften Philip’s anger\r\nas much as possible. In a letter of July 18, from St. Germain to his\r\nambassador in Spain, after stating the motives which have led him to\r\ndispatch D’Ozances, he adds: “Au demeurant, je ne doubte point qu’on\r\nsème de beaulx bruictz par delà, touchant le faict de la Religion, et\r\nqu’on ne nous face beaucoup plus malades que nous ne sommes; et, pour\r\nceste occasion il m’a semblé qu’il serait fort à propos que le Sr.\r\nd’Auzances feist entendre au Roy, mon bon frère, les termes en quoy\r\nnous en sommes.” Then follow details upon the edict of pacification.\r\nThis letter was sold at auction in 1877. It is catalogued in the\r\n_Inventaire des autographes et des documents historiques composant la\r\ncollection de M. Benjamin Fillon_, Paris, Charavay, 1877 (Series I,\r\n34, No. 132—“Lettre de Charles IX contre-sig.

In consequence of this state of things we find\r\nnumerous ordinances passed in the summer of 1561 in restraint of\r\nviolence; cf. “Edit sur la religion, sur le moyen de tenir le peuple\r\nen paix et sur la répression des séditieux, July 1561,” Isambert,\r\nXIV, 109; “Edit pour remedier aux troubles, et sur la répression des\r\nséditieux,” October 20, 1561, _ibid._, XIV, 122; “Edit sur le port\r\nd’armes à feu, la vente de ces armes et les formalités à suivre par les\r\nfabricants,” October 21, 1561, _ibid._, XIV, 123.\r\n\r\n[390] _C. S. P. Ven._, No. 237, February 17, 1561, says: “_one_\r\nrepresentative with absolute authority to treat and conclude what might\r\nbe approved by the majority of votes.” But La Place, III, 121, says two\r\nrepresentatives were chosen from each bailiwick. Cf. De Crue, _Anne de\r\nMontmorency_, 300.\r\n\r\n[391] The estates of the Ile-de-France demanded that the council and\r\ngovernment of the King should be formed according to the ancient\r\nconstitution of the realm; that the accounts of the previous\r\nadministration should be examined; that the queen mother should be\r\nremoved from the government and be content with being guardian of the\r\nKing’s person; that no stranger be admitted to be of the council; that\r\nno cardinal, bishop, or other ecclesiastical person having made suit\r\nto the Pope, should have any place in the Privy Council, not even\r\nthe cardinal Bourbon, though he was a prince of the blood, unless he\r\nresigned his hat; that the king of Navarre be regent of the realm\r\nwith the title of lieutenant-general, and that with him be joined a\r\ncouncil of the princes of the blood and others; that the admiral and\r\nM. de Rochefoucault should have charge of the education of the King.\r\nOn these conditions the Estates offered to discharge the King’s debts\r\nin six years; but in the event of refusal, they declared that the King\r\nmust live upon the incomes of the royal domain, much of which was\r\nmortgaged (_C. S. P. For._, No. 77, sec. 3, March 31).

For._, No. 753, from Strasburg, December 30, 1561.\r\nWriting just a week earlier, on December 23, to his sovereign,\r\nChantonnay strongly condemned the course of Catherine at Poissy because\r\nit had militated against the authority of Trent, and had given courage\r\nto the heretics to continue their synods.—K. 1,494, No. 104.

S. P.\r\nFor._, Nos. 225 and 245, June 6-13, 1561; No. 273, June 23, 1561. The\r\nchoice was a tactless one on the part of the Pope and one certain to\r\nantagonize Catherine de Medici as well as the political Huguenots,\r\nfor the cardinal was a relative of the Guises by marriage. Don Luigo\r\nd’Este, the duke of Ferrara’s brother, was the son of Alphonso d’Este\r\nand Lucretia Borgia. He resigned his place in the church and married\r\nthe duchess of Estouteville, a marriage indicating the Guise policy of\r\naggrandisement (_C. S. P. For._, No. 904, March 27, 1560). The marriage\r\nmade bitter feeling between the House of Ferrara and the Guises.\r\n“There is a breach between the Dukes of Ferrara and Guise touching the\r\nformer’s mother, who, being very rich, and lately fallen out with her\r\nson, had secretly sent to the Duke of Guise, a gentleman with a message\r\nthat she would come to France and end her life there and be as his\r\nmother. Word was sent her that she would be welcome; and if her son\r\nwould not permit her to come with her substance, he would take into his\r\nhands the assignation made by the late king upon certain lands for the\r\npayment of 100,000 crowns yearly to the Duke till such time as 600,000\r\ncrowns, borrowed from him at the Duke of Guise’s last voyage to Rome,\r\nwere paid off. The Duke keeps his mother with good watch for fear of\r\nher escaping to France.”—_C. S. P.

The correspondence between Chantonnay and Philip leaves no room\r\nfor doubt of the fact that Nemours was acting as the agent of Spain\r\n(K. 1,494, No. 106, October 31, from St. Cloud; No. 114, November 28,\r\n1561), although Philip repudiated complicity in a letter to Catherine\r\n(K. 1,495, No. 90, November 27, 1561), and Chantonnay declared the\r\nwhole story was a trick of the Huguenots.\r\n\r\n[434] D’Aubigné, 321. Chantonnay seems to have been apprehensive lest\r\nthe circumstances might precipitate the civil war which every one\r\nfeared (Letter to Philip II, November 28, 1561, K. 1,494, No. 114),\r\nand seized the opportunity afforded by it to read the queen mother\r\na lecture.

(See his letter, September 27, 1561, in _Mém.\r\nde l’Acad des sc. moral. et polit._, CIV, 660.)

Five days later, on\r\nNovember 28, 1561, Catherine de Medici wrote to the same ambassador:\r\n“Je me défie tent de seux qui sont mal contens ... car je ne veos\r\nni ne suys conselliée de venir aus armes.”—_Collection de lettres\r\nautographes ayant appartenu à M.

For._,\r\nNo. 659, §18, November 14, 1561). Catherine sent a special agent,\r\nRambouillet, into Germany to assist Hotman in discovering information\r\nabout Spain’s intrigues there (_C. S. P. For._, No. 713, December,\r\n1561; _Mém. de l’Acad. des sc. moral. et polit._, CIV [1877], 661).\r\nD’Ozances in Spain received special instructions to decipher Philip\r\nII’s conduct if possible.\r\n\r\n[455] _C. S. P. For._, No. 265, §11, June 23, 1561. This was in\r\nconsequence of the apprehension aroused early in May by the appearance\r\nof a large body of Spanish infantry and cavalry to survey Abbeville\r\nwhence they returned toward Guisnes (_ibid._, No. 248, from Paris, May\r\n18, 1561).\r\n\r\n[456] _Ibid._, No. 712, December 9, 1561, from Strasburg; No. 717,\r\n§6, December 13, 1561, from Paris. There had been some anxiety lest\r\nthe Emperor might avail himself of the distraction in France to seize\r\nthe Three Bishoprics. But at this moment, on account of the activity\r\nof both the Turk and the Muscovite, and because he was angry with the\r\nPope over the Council of Trent, Ferdinand, was friendly to France and\r\ncordially received Marillac, the bishop of Vienne (D’Aubigné, I, 332,\r\n333).\r\n\r\n[457] “Le conseil du roi, voyant que les mouvements les plus\r\ndivers agitaient le royaume, décide que chaque gouverneur,\r\nlieutenant, sénéschal et autres ministres, se rendissent à leurs\r\ngouvernements.”—Baschet, _Journal du Concile de Trente_, 89.\r\n\r\n[458] _C.

The\r\nappointments of Coligny and Condé never became operative, owing to the\r\noutbreak of civil war early in the next year. They are important only\r\nas they reflect Catherine’s policy of caution and craft.\r\n\r\n[459] _Ibid._, No. 729. Thomas Shakerley was an Englishman by birth,\r\nwho had once been a page to Edward VI, while the latter was prince. He\r\nhad left England nine years before and had spent most of his time in\r\nRome, where, becoming an organist, he “obtained the estimation of a\r\ncunning player for the substance and solemnity of music.” He came to\r\nFrance in the suite of the cardinal of Ferrara. The Spanish ambassador\r\napproached him with an offer to enter the secret service of Spain,\r\nwhich Shakerley patriotically communicated to Throckmorton (_ibid._,\r\nNo. 730, §5, December 18; No. 750, §10, December 28, 1561).\r\n\r\n[460] On December 27, the Protestants congregated in the Faubourg St.\r\nMarceau, whereupon the priests and Papists assembled at St. Medard\r\nand determined to attack them. One of the Protestant soldiers going\r\nto remonstrate was run through. The Protestants who were appointed to\r\nguard the assembly, seeing this, ran to his succor, but were driven\r\nback by the numbers. Other Protestants coming up put their attackers\r\nto rout and forced their way into the church, when the prince de la\r\nRoche-sur-Yon, the King’s lieutenant, arrived with a strong force of\r\nhorse and foot and carried off several to the Châtelet (_ibid._, No.\r\n783, January 4, 1561; _Mém. de Condé_, II, 541 ff.; Claude Haton, 179,\r\nand note; _Arch. cur._, IV, 63 ff.; and an article in _Mém. de la soc.\r\nde l’hist. de Paris_, 1886).\r\n\r\n[461] _C.

The prince de la\r\nRoche-sur-Yon passed for a Calvinist, while the marshal Montmorency\r\nwas a liberal Catholic. The queen mother hoped the change would be\r\nacceptable to both parties. Another reason for this change was that\r\nthe constable and the prince de la Roche-sur-Yon were the principals\r\nin a law-suit involving 10,000 ducats income. It was possible for the\r\nlieutenant of Paris to use influence with the Parlement of Paris before\r\nwhich the case was to be tried, and this more obviously favored the\r\nconstable’s side of the suit.

The King sent a special\r\nofficer to put the offenders to death and destroy the village, but it\r\nis significant that this commission was not intrusted to Villars, who\r\nwas sublieutenant in Languedoc and notorious for his treatment of the\r\nHuguenots (_C. S. P. For._, No. 750, §10, December 28, 1561).\r\n\r\n[466] Claude Haton, I, 195-98, 236, 237. His spleen is evidenced,\r\nthough, in saying that: “à cause de la grande liberté à mal faire et\r\ndire qui leur estoit permise sans aulcune punition de justice ... si\r\nle plus grand larron et voleur du pays eust esté prins prisonnier il\r\neust eschappé à tout danger voire à la mort, moyennant qu’il se feust\r\ndéclaré Huguenot et de la nouvelle prétendue religion.”—_Ibid._, I,\r\n124.

R.”\r\n\r\n[467] _Archives de la Gironde_, XV, 57.\r\n\r\n[468] Claude Haton, I, 194, 195, and note.\r\n\r\n[469] Chantonnay to Philip II, January 5, 1562, K. 1,497, B. 15. The\r\nSpanish ambassador violently expostulated with Catherine de Medici,\r\nAntoine of Bourbon, and others after this address was over (K. 1,497,\r\nJanuary 11, 1562), for which Philip II commended him (K. 1,496, No. 34,\r\n3 _verso_).\r\n\r\n[470] Isambert, XIV, 124-29; Raynaldus, XXXIV, 292, 293. The original\r\ndocument is on exhibition in the Musée des Archives at Paris. It is\r\ncatalogued K. 674, No. 4. Although authorized on January 17, the edict\r\nwas not printed until March 13, 1562 (_C. S. P. For._, No. 930, §11;\r\n934, §1). The Edict of July had been only negative in its character,\r\nsimply forbidding judges and the magistrates from pursuing the\r\nHuguenots, but not in any sense recognizing their religion. Castelnau,\r\nBook I, chap. ii, makes this very clear. The Edict encountered strong\r\nopposition in the Parlement, which twice rejected it by a plurality\r\nvote (_C. S. P. For._, No. 849, January 28, 1562; Claude Haton, I, 185,\r\n186). Benoist, _Histoire de l’Edit de Nantes_, I, Appendix, gives the\r\ntext together with the first and second mandamus of the King, February\r\n14 and March 11, 1562, expressly enjoining the Parlement “to proceed to\r\nthe reading, publishing, and registering of the said ordinance, laying\r\naside all delays and difficulties.” The first mandamus, “Déclaration\r\net interprétation du roy sur certains mots et articles contenus dans\r\nl’edict du XVII de janvier 1561,” declared that magistrates were not\r\nofficers within the meaning of the edict (Isambert, XIV, 129, n. 2).\r\nKlipfel, _Le colloque de Poissy_, chap. iii, makes the point that the\r\nParlement of Paris was criminally wrong in arraigning itself upon the\r\nside of violence and encouraging the intolerance of the populace. The\r\nParlement of Rouen was more complacent, and seems promptly to have\r\nregistered it (_C. S. P. For._, No. 891, §10, February 16, 1562).\r\n\r\nThe Edict of January is sometimes wrongly dated January 17, _1561_.\r\nThe error arises from the confusion of the calendar in the sixteenth\r\ncentury. In 1561 the year in France legally began at Easter, which,\r\nof course threw January 17, into the year 1561. But in 1564 a royal\r\n_ordonnance_ abolished this usage and established January 1 as the\r\nbeginning of the year, which brought forward January 17 into its proper\r\nyear, 1562. The reform of the calendar by Gregory XIII would alter the\r\n_date of the month_ also, according to modern reckoning. But it is\r\nsimpler to let established dates stand. Henry III authorized the use of\r\nthe Gregorian calendar in France in 1582. For a lucid account of these\r\nchanges see _Commentaires et lettres de Montluc_, IV, Introd., x-xi by\r\nthe baron de Ruble.\r\n\r\n[471] Baschet, _Journal du Concile de Trente_, 71.\r\n\r\n[472] Claude Haton, I, 177, and n. 1. For other details see Castelnau,\r\nBook III, chap. i; _Rel. vén._, II, 71.\r\n\r\n[473] _Lettres de Pasquier_, II, 96. Mignet characterizes the\r\nprovisions of the Edict of January as “généréuses, simples, et sages.”\r\nMignet, “Les lettres de Calvin” (_Journal des savants_, 1859, p. 762),\r\nand Haag, _La France protestante_, Introd., xix, as “le plus libéral\r\nédit qui ait été obtenu par les réformés jusqu’à celui de Nantes.”\r\n\r\n[474] _C.

The importation of money from Germany into\r\nLorraine was no secret.\r\n\r\n[475] _Ibid._, No. 729, §3, December 16, 1561.

The whole letter is exceedingly interesting.\r\n\r\n[480] The Jesuits had long tried to get a legal status in France. Henry\r\nII, was favorable to them, but the Parlement of Paris, the secular\r\nclergy, and the Sorbonne were bitterly opposed. The Act of Poissy\r\nrecognized the Jesuits as a college but not as a religious order, to\r\nthe anger of the Sorbonne. See Douarche, _L’Université de Paris et les\r\nJesuites_, Paris, 1888, chap. iv. At the time of the expulsion of the\r\nJesuits from France in 1761, in reply to the question of the crown as\r\nto their legal status, the cardinal de Choiseul made the following\r\nanswer: “Lorsqu’ils ont été reçus en France l’an 1561, par le concours\r\ndes deux puissances, ils se sont soumis et ont été astreints par la loi\r\npublique de leur établissement à toute superintendance, jurisdiction\r\net correction de l’évêque diocésain et à se conformer entièrement à la\r\ndisposition du droit commun, avec la renonciation la plus formelle aux\r\nprivilèges contraires portés dans les quatre bulles par eux présentées\r\nou autres qu’ils pourraient obtenir à l’avenir.” ... “_Le véritable\r\nétat des Jésuites en France parâit donc être, suivant les lois\r\ncanoniques reçues dans le royaume, l’état des réguliers soumis à la\r\njuridiction des ordinaires conformement au droit com mun._” Cf.

April 8 he wrote\r\nto Philip advising that the couriers be sent via Perpignan and Lyons in\r\norder to avoid being intercepted, as the Huguenots commanded the whole\r\nline of the Loire. Cf. Letters to Philip II, April 24, 1562, K. 1,497,\r\nNo. 25; K. 1,497, No. 21; K. 1,497, No. 28.\r\n\r\nHis letter of May 5 (K. 1,497, No. 28) describes the adventure of a\r\ncourier bearing a dispatch of the bishop of Limoges. He was given\r\ntwenty blows with a knife, but managed to escape. St. Sulpice reports\r\na similar experience of “le chevaucher de Bayonne” in a letter to\r\nCatherine, June 30, 1562. D’Andelot intercepted a letter from the duke\r\nof Alva (K. 1,497, No. 26, April 28, 1562) and the prince of Condé one\r\nfrom the bishop of Limoges to Catherine de Medici (K. 1,497, No. 33).\r\nThe activity of the Huguenots in Gascony gave the French and Spanish\r\ngovernments special disquietude because they continually overhauled\r\nthe couriers bearing official dispatches between Paris and Madrid.\r\nThe letters of St. Sulpice contain many complaints because of the\r\nrifling of his correspondence (see pp. 30, 35, 37, 38, 41, 59). But\r\nthe Huguenots were not the only ones who scrutinized letters unduly.\r\nPhilip II frequently asked to be shown the letters of Charles IX and\r\nhis mother to his wife, so that St. Sulpice advised Catherine always\r\nto send two letters, one of which was to be a “dummy” to be shown to\r\nthe King (_L’Ambassade de St. Sulpice_, 136). The Spanish ambassador\r\ntold Philip he would have to come out into the open and declare war\r\nto protect his own interests (K. 1,497, No. 26, April 25, 1562). He\r\nanticipated as early as this the probable combination of the French\r\nHuguenots and the Dutch rebels, and warned Margaret of Parma to be on\r\nher guard (_Correspondance de Chantonnay_, K. 1,497, Nos. 30, 33, to\r\nPhilip II).\r\n\r\n[525] _C. S. P. For._, No. 1,043, §2, April 24, 1562.\r\n\r\n[526] On April 24 the cardinal of Lorraine came to Paris with 1,000\r\nhorse (_C. S. P. For._, No. 1,043, §11, April 24, 1562; _Corresp. de\r\nChantonnay_, April 28, K. 1,497, No. 2).\r\n\r\n[527] This famous document, which is dated April 21, 1562, is in K.\r\n1,496, B, 14, No. 61, and is on exhibition in the Musée des Archives.\r\nChantonnay’s letter to Philip II on April 24 sheds an interesting\r\nlight on the situation. In it the ambassador advises the King to write\r\npersonally to the queen mother, but not to write individually to the\r\nothers, but rather a single letter, because if Antoine of Navarre were\r\nnot addressed as _King of Navarre_ he would refuse to receive it,\r\nwhereas if the letter were written to all in common, this complication\r\nmight be avoided (K. 1,497, No. 25).\r\n\r\n[528] The Spanish King acceded to this request on June 8, 1562 (Philip\r\nII to Margaret of Parma; Gachard, _Correspondance de Philippe II sur\r\nles Pays-Bas_, II, 218-23.)\r\n\r\nHe promised to send 10,000 foot and 3,000 cavalry, chiefly Italians\r\nand Germans; cf. De Ruble, _Antoine de Bourbon et Jeanne d’Albret_,\r\nIV, 214. At about the same time the constable appealed to Rome through\r\nSanta Croce, for a loan of 200,000 écus and a body of soldiers (_Arch.\r\ncur._, VI, 86).\r\n\r\n[529] The Swiss Diet, which met at Soleure on May 22, offered 6,000\r\ninfantry to be commanded by the captain Froelich (Letter of Hotman in\r\n_Revue hist._, XCVII, March-April, 1908, 305).\r\n\r\n[530] _C. S. P. For._, No. 6, §1, May 2, 1562. The Spanish ambassador\r\nwas deeply incensed at Catherine for making this new overture. The\r\nintermediary was the Rhinegrave, but Chantonnay persuaded the leaders\r\nnot to recognize him (_Corresp. de Chantonnay_, April 28, 1562; K.\r\n1,497, No. 26). The duke of Savoy offered to furnish 10,000 footmen\r\nand 600 horse, 3,000 of the former and 200 of the latter to be at his\r\nexpense. This was the fruit of Chantonnay’s interview with Moreta,\r\nthe Savoyard ambassador, early in April, when he discussed with him a\r\npossible restoration of the fortresses in Piedmont (K. 1,497, No. 21,\r\nApril 8, 1562).\r\n\r\n[531] The Pope offered to give 50,000 crowns per month.\r\n\r\n[532] “Suisses, lansquenetz et reystres, seront en ce pays devant\r\nla fin de ce moys, sans vostre secours d’Espagne.”—_L’Ambassade de\r\nSt. Sulpice_, 24, June 12, 1562. It must be understood that in many\r\nEuropean states, especially those of Germany, the maintenance of\r\nregular troops did not yet obtain as a practice. Instead, the princes\r\ndepended upon mercenary forces recruited by some distinguished captain.\r\nThese troops, which answered to the _condottieri_ of Italy were\r\ncalled _Lanzknechts_ or _Reiters_. Languet stigmatizes this practice\r\nin _Epist. ad Camerariam_, 28; cf. _Arch. d’Orange-Nassau_, I, 104.\r\nIn Protestant Germany there was a feeling that the policy of France\r\nthreatened to extinguish the gospel in other regions besides France and\r\ntherefore should be opposed by common consent. The elector palatine,\r\nthe landgrave, and Charles, margrave of Baden, planned to send an\r\nembassy into France in the name of the Protestant princes to allay the\r\ndissensions there, and to ask that the same liberty of religion might\r\nbe granted as was allowed by the edict of January 17. Many advocated an\r\nopen league between all the Protestant states for mutual protection, in\r\nthe hope that the mere knowledge of such a league would restrain their\r\nadversaries (_C. S. P. For._, No. 11, May 2, 1562). Opinion was divided\r\nin Germany as to whether Condé also should make foreign enrolments,\r\nor whether the territories of those who had suffered these levies\r\nto be made should be invaded by the Lutherans. Agents of the Guises\r\ncirculated a printed apology for the massacre at Vassy (D’Aubigné, II,\r\n16, and n. 2; La Popelinière, I, 327).\r\n\r\nRambouillet and D’Oysel, the agents of France in these countries (St.\r\nSulpice, 77; _Corresp. de Catherine de Médicis_, I, 364) made much of\r\nthe King of Spain’s aid and carried credentials from Chantonnay. The\r\nduke of Guise even sent an agent, the count of Roussy, to England, to\r\ndiscover Elizabeth’s intentions, and to ascertain the military state of\r\nher kingdom (cf. Beza, _Hist. des églises réformées_, ed. of Toulouse,\r\nI, 373; De Ruble, IV, 103 ff.; _L’Ambassade de St. Sulpice_, 13; _C. S.\r\nP. For._, No. 1,037, April 21, 1562).\r\n\r\nThe argument of the Catholics with the German Protestant princes and\r\nimperial cities was that the Huguenots were political dissidents and\r\nrebels, and that religion was a pretext with them (_L’Ambassade de\r\nSt. Sulpice_, 65). In order to counteract this teaching the Huguenots\r\ncirculated a pamphlet written by Hotman throughout the Rhine provinces\r\nwhich attempted to neutralize the differences between Calvinism and\r\nLutheranism. (This curious pamphlet is printed in _Mém. de Condé_, II,\r\n524; La Popelinière, I, 325. In this capacity Hotman was invaluable.\r\nSome of his letters at this time are in _Mém. de l’Acad._, CIV, 662-65.)\r\n\r\nThe German princes as a whole tried to prevent soldiers from going\r\nout of Germany. The landgrave Philip of Hesse arrested an officer of\r\ncavalry who was secretly enlisting horsemen in Hesse and who said he\r\nwas doing so for Roggendorf, tore up the officer’s commission before\r\nhis face, and made him swear to leave his castle without a passport.\r\nThe duke of Württemberg also took care that no volunteers should march\r\nthrough Montbéliard into France, and Strasburg forbade anyone to enlist\r\nunder severe penalties. The bishops of the Rhine kept quiet; only in\r\nLorraine and the Three Bishoprics was Catholic enlisting unimpeded. The\r\nrecruiting-sergeant of the Guises in Germany was the famous Roggendorf,\r\na Frisian by birth who had been driven out of his native land in 1548\r\nand since then had lived the life of an adventurer, part of the time in\r\nTurkey. (See an interesting note in Poulet, I, 542, with references.)\r\nOn April 8 the king of Navarre in the name of Charles IX, signed a\r\nconvention with him engaging the services of 1,200 German mounted\r\npistoleers and four cornettes of footmen of 300 men each (D’Aubigné,\r\nII, 33, n.). These forces entered France late in July and reached the\r\ncamp at Blois on August 7 (D’Aubigné, II, 76, n. 3).\r\n\r\nOne reason why the Protestant princes of Germany were unable\r\nimmediately to make strong protest to the French crown was that the\r\nenvoys of the elector palatine, the dukes of Deuxponts and Württemberg,\r\nthe landgrave of Hesse and the margrave of Baden, were unprovided for\r\na month with letters of safe conduct, by the precaution of the Guises,\r\nwith the result that Roggendorf led 1,200 cavalry in the first week in\r\nMay across the Rhine and through Trèves into France for the Guises,\r\nthough the Protestant princes did all they could to hinder the passage\r\nand expostulated with the bishops of Trèves and Cologne for allowing\r\nthem to be levied in their territories. Failing greater things, the\r\nProtestant princes of Germany, in July, 1562, put Roggendorf under\r\nthe ban in their respective states (cf. _C. S. P. For._, Nos. 244 and\r\n269, June 13 and July, 1562). In the end, despite the enterprise of\r\nthe Guises, the French Catholics may be said to have been unsuccessful\r\nbeyond the Rhine, that is in Germany proper, but not in Switzerland or\r\nthe episcopal states. D’Oysel, who was sent by Charles IX in July to\r\nHeidelberg (D’Aubigné, II, 97, and n. 1; Le Laboureur, I, 430) received\r\na short and definite answer “which showed him how groundless were his\r\nhopes of aid from that quarter, a document to which so much importance\r\nwas attributed that it was forthwith printed for wider circulation”\r\n(_C. S. P. For._, No. 414, August 3, 1562, and the Introduction, xi).\r\n\r\nThe king of Spain’s captains had money and were ordered that as soon\r\nas soldiers were taken from Germany into France they should enlist men\r\nfor the defense of his territories (_C. S. P. For._, No. 11, May 2,\r\n1562). In the bishopric of Trèves soldiers were enrolled easily, as the\r\npassage from thence to France was short (_ibid._, No. 74, May 19, 1562).\r\n\r\nIn Switzerland the Huguenots endeavored to prevail upon the Protestant\r\ncantons to prevent the Catholic cantons from lending support to Guise\r\n(_C. S. P. Ven._, No. 285, April 29, 1562). The Guises asked for a\r\nlevy of foot from the papist cantons of Switzerland in the King’s\r\nname (_Corresp. de Catherine de Médicis_, I, 289, April 8, 1562).\r\nThe cantons promised to send 15 ensigns; but the Protestant cantons\r\nespecially Bern, told the prince of Condé that they would not suffer\r\nany soldiers to be levied against him in their territory, on pain of\r\nconfiscation of goods. Nevertheless the Catholic Swiss managed to make\r\nsome enrolments, the men quitting home on July 8. On August 7 these\r\nmercenaries arrived at Blois, having come by way of Franche Comté\r\n(De Thou, Book XXX). They were commanded by Captain Froelich (see\r\nD’Aubigné, II, 148; Zurlauben, _Hist. milit. des Suisses_, IV, 287 ff.;\r\nLetter of Hotman in _Rev. hist._, XCVII, March-April, 1908, 307).\r\n\r\n[533] _Correspondance de Chantonnay_, K. 1,497, No. 22.\r\n\r\n[534] “La fleur du monde.”—_L’Ambassade de St. Sulpice_, 41.

Both parties fought for three days for possession of\r\nthe Hôtel-de-Ville where arms were stored.

The Parlement promptly approved her course. _Mém.—journaux du\r\nduc de Guise_, 495, col. 2: “Acte par lequel la Reinemère et le Roy de\r\nNavarre declarent que la retraite voluntaire que font de la cour du duc\r\nde Guise, le Connestable et le mareschal de St. André, ne pourra porter\r\npréjudice à leur honneur” (May 28, 1562).\r\n\r\n[561] “Nostre camps et à douse lyeu d’Orleans et byentot nous voyront\r\nset que en sera.”—Catherine de Medici to Elizabeth of Spain, June 13\r\nor 14, 1562, in _L’Ambassade de St. Sulpice_, 31.\r\n\r\n[562] A parley was held with the usual lack of success on June 21\r\nbetween the prince of Condé and his brother at Beaugency, which was\r\nneutralized for the purpose (D’Aubigné, II, 37, and n. 4). The baron de\r\nRuble discovered the correspondence of the principals in the interview.\r\nThe king of Navarre exhorted his brother to accept the conditions\r\noffered by the King, i. e., to let the Huguenots dwell peaceably\r\nin their houses until a council settled the matters in dispute. He\r\npromised in any event that the Protestants should have liberty of\r\nconscience. But when the prince insisted on having the edict enforced\r\nin Paris even, Antoine replied that the crown would never consent to\r\nsuch terms (_C. S. P. For._, No. 329, §§1, 2, July 17, 1562). Even\r\nwhile the truce existed straggling prisoners were taken daily by either\r\nside. (For other military details, see _Mém. de La Noue_ [ed. Panthéon\r\nlitt.], 284; D’Aubigné, II, 39, 40; Beza, _Histoire des églises\r\nréformées_, I, 540, 541; and the “Discours ou récit des opérations\r\ndes deux armées catholique et protestante dans les premiers jours de\r\njuillet,” in De Ruble, _Antoine de Bourbon et Jeanne d’Albret_, IV,\r\n414).\r\n\r\n[563] Not so the royal troops, which were quartered upon the towns of\r\nthe region and nearly consumed the people by their exactions (Claude\r\nHaton, I, 279).\r\n\r\n[564] The Catholics, in derision, called the Huguenot gentry “millers.”\r\nDuring the interview on June 9 between the prince and the queen mother,\r\nthe latter said: “Vos gens sont meusniers, mon cousin,” a fling which\r\nthe prince of Condé more than matched by the rejoinder: “C’est pour\r\ntoucher vous asnes, madame!” This anecdote is related by D’Aubigné, II,\r\n35.\r\n\r\n[565] Cf. Guise’s letter to the cardinal of Lorraine, Appendix III; _C.\r\nS. P. For._, No. 238; No. 264, §3, June 29.\r\n\r\n[566] _Ibid._, No. 425, August 5, 1562; _Archives de la Gironde_, XVII,\r\n270. The constable seized Tours and Villars Châtellerault (D’Aubigné,\r\nII, 41-44). For the operations of Burie in Périgord, see _Archives de\r\nla Gironde_, XVII, 271. At Bazas a local judge, with the aid of Spanish\r\ntroops actually crucified some Calvinists (_ibid._, XV, 57).\r\n\r\n[567] La Noue admits that the boasted discipline of the Huguenots was\r\ndisgraced by their atrocities here (_Mém. milit._, chap. xvi; cf. _C.\r\nS. P. Ven._, No. 288, July 16, 1562).\r\n\r\n[568] On the war in Lyonnais, Dauphiné, Provence, and Languedoc, see\r\nD’Aubigné, Book III, chap. vii. The notes are valuable. Des Adresse\r\nproclaimed all Catholics in Lyonnais, Burgundy, Dauphiné, and Limousin\r\nrebels to the King (_C. S. P. For._, 340). He was not a Huguenot in\r\nthe proper sense, but rebelled against the King, and sided with the\r\nHuguenots because he was jealous of La Mothe Gondrin, who was made\r\n_lieutenant du roi_ instead of himself in Dauphiné (see D’Aubigné, II,\r\n49, n. 5).\r\n\r\n[569] D’Aubigné, II, 48. He recovered Châlons-sur-Marne in June and\r\nMacon in August (Tavannes, 339, 343).\r\n\r\n[570] It was at this moment that D’Andelot was sent to Germany for\r\nsuccor (_C. S. P. For._, No. 374, §7, July 27, 1562).\r\n\r\n[571] At Pont Audemer the duke caused a preacher to be hanged, and\r\nafterward some of the best citizens and even boys (_C. S. P. Ven._,\r\n355, July 23, 1562). There was also fear lest the English would land\r\ntroops in Guyenne (_Archives de la Gironde_, XVII, 284).\r\n\r\n[572] _C. S. P.

The prince of Orange found himself in a\r\nvery difficult position. His principality was continually exposed to\r\nthe attacks of the king of France and those of the Pope from Avignon.\r\nMoreover, the conduct of the Huguenots compromised him on account of\r\ntheir violence toward the priests in the sanctuaries (_Archives de la\r\nmaison d’Orange-Nassau_, I, 71, 72; Raumer, II, 2111561).\r\n\r\n[574] Forneron, _Histoire de Philippe II_, I, 294. Montluc is unequaled\r\nin the keenness of his political penetration. The baron de Ruble\r\nsays with truth that the old soldier rivals Hotman and Bodin in this\r\nrespect. Witness the paragraph written in December, 1563, to be found\r\nin the memoir he sent to Damville justifying his resignation of the\r\nlieutenancy of Guyenne (_Commentaires et lettres de Montluc_, IV, 297,\r\n298 and note).\r\n\r\n[575] There are few more interesting annals in the history of war than\r\nthe racy, egotistical, garrulous, yet sometimes pithy narrative of this\r\nveteran leader. The fifth book of Montluc’s _Commentaires_ is wholly\r\ntaken up with the war in Guyenne in 1562-63. His correspondence during\r\nthe same period is in IV, 111-225; add Beza, _Histoire des églises\r\nréformées_, which is remarkably accurate and impartial.\r\n\r\n[576] Coll.

When these Spaniards later mutinied and\r\ndeserted in the summer of 1563, not even the Catholics regretted their\r\ndeparture (_L’Ambassade de St. Sulpice_, 144, 152).

See in the _Mém. de Condé_, III, some letters\r\nrelating to the coming of the reiters in this year.\r\n\r\n[586] “Ceux-ci [reiters] sont toujours prêts à se battre, mais en\r\ntout le reste, ils n’obéissent à personne et montrent la plus grande\r\ncruauté. Ils pillent tout, et cela ne leur suffit pas. Ils dévastent\r\ntout et détruisent les vins et les récoltes.”—Letter of Hotman in\r\n_Rev. hist._, XCVII, March-April, 1908, 311.\r\n\r\n[587] Claude Haton, I, 294.\r\n\r\n[588] _Ibid._ From an account in the Record Office, indorsed by Cecil,\r\nwe know what the wages of these hireling troops were: “The pay of every\r\nreiter is 15 florins the month. The entertainment of the ritmeisters\r\nis a florin for every horse, and each cornet contains 300 men. The\r\nlieutenants have, besides the pay of one reiter, 80 florins. The\r\nensign, besides the pay of one reiter, has 60 florins, eight officers\r\nhaving, besides a reiter’s pay, 15 florins apiece. The wage and\r\nappointment of 4,000 reiters with their officers _per mensem_ equals\r\n122,048 livres _tournois_, equals 81,532 florins. The colonel 3,000\r\nflorins; 15 officers equals 300 florins. To every ten reiters there\r\nmust be allowed a carriage with four horses, at 30 florins per month.\r\nTotal (not counting the money rebated) 127,448 livres _tournois_, or\r\n84,966 florins. Total expense for four months, counting the levy,\r\n569,792 livres _tournois_ equals 379,861 florins.\r\n\r\n“For levying 6,000 lansknechts: for their levying, a crown per month.\r\nThe pay of every ensign of 300 men per month, 3,500 _livres tournois_.\r\nThe whole expense for four months 395,000 livres _tournois_ equals\r\n263,337 florins. Sum total with other expenses, 1,759,792 livres\r\n_tournois_ equals 211,174,175, 2d.”\r\n\r\n[589] D’Andelot passed the Rhine on September 22, too late to relieve\r\nBourges.\r\n\r\n[590] See Claude Haton’s vivid description of this recruiting. The new\r\nlevies did great damage to the country of Brie and Champagne, for they\r\nwere kept in villages for more than five weeks before going to camp,\r\nand all this time the reiters were approaching closely (I, 295).\r\n\r\n[591] Claude Haton, I, 295. He adds that Catherine de Medici sent\r\nhim secret orders to do so. But there is no evidence of this in her\r\ncorrespondence, and D’Aumale’s subsequent blunder in 1569 by which\r\nthe Huguenots were able to get possession of La Charité justifies the\r\ninference that his action was due to incapacity as a general.\r\n\r\n[592] The long presence of the reiters in France during the civil\r\nwars introduced many German words into the French language, for\r\nexample _bière_ (_Bier_); _blocus_ (_Blockhaus_); _boulevard_\r\n(_Bollwerk_); _bourgmestre_ (_Burgmeister_); _canapsa_ (_Knapsack_);\r\n_carousser_ (_Garaus machen_); _castine_ (_Kalkstein_); _halte_\r\n(_halt_); _trinquer_ (_trinken_) and of course _reitre_ (_Reiter_)\r\nand _lansquenet_ (_Lanzknecht_). See Nyrop, _Grammaire historique de\r\nla langue française_, I, 51. Rabelais abounds with such words, e. g.,\r\n“Je ne suis de cas importuns _lifrelofres_ qui, par force, poultraige\r\net violence, contraignent les lans et compaignons _trinquer_, voire\r\n_carous_ et alluz qui pis est.” Rabelais, Book IV, prologue. So also in\r\nBook IV, prol.: “Je n’y ay entendu que le _hault allemant_.”\r\n\r\n[593] In Provins, on their own initiative, the townspeople taxed\r\ntheir town, bailiwick, and _réssort_ (_sénéchausée_) to the amount of\r\n7,000 livres _tournois_, the sum being imposed upon persons of every\r\nclass, those who had gone to the war in the King’s service alone being\r\nexempted. This levy created great discontent, especially among the\r\nclergy, who appealed against the bailiff and the _gens du roi_ to the\r\nCourt of Aids, alleging that the levy was made without royal commission\r\nand without the consent of those interested. The bailiff compromised\r\nby promising the clergy to restore the money paid by them and not to\r\ndemand more of them, and so the process was dropped (Claude Haton, I,\r\n296, 297).\r\n\r\n[594] On the siege of Bourges see D’Aubigné, II, 77 ff.; Raynal, _Hist.\r\ndu Berry_, IV; _Mém. des antiq. de France_, sér.

Alva’s opinion is given at p.\r\n78).\r\n\r\n[595] Claude Haton, I, 285. Philip II told St. Sulpice “quant un\r\nvoyage de Normandie, bien qu’il l’estimait être bien entrepris, qu’il\r\nsemblait qu’il eut été meilleur de s’adresser à Orleans, où étaient les\r\nchefs, afin qu’ils ne se grossissent d’avantage.”—_L’Ambassade de St.\r\nSulpice_, 75.\r\n\r\n[596] _C.

This solicitation was\r\nin the nature of an acknowledgment of an expression of interest in\r\nthem made by the English queen. For as far back as March she had sent\r\nassurances of her interest to Condé and the admiral (_ibid._, No. 965,\r\nMarch 3, 1562).\r\n\r\n[599] _C. S. P.

Elizabeth considered\r\nthe suggestion of her ambassador so favorable that she sent Sir\r\nHenry Sidney to France in the spring to aid Throckmorton. See the\r\ninstructions in _C. S. P. For._, Nos. 1,063, 1,064, April 28, 1562.\r\n\r\n[601] “Et il assure que bien qu’elle prenne à dépit de voir que\r\nles catholiques soient secourus de deça, elle est persuadée\r\nque son meilleur est de se contenir et regarder de loin ce qui\r\nadviendra.”—_L’Ambassade de St. Sulpice_, 55, July, 1562.\r\n\r\n[602] “Réponses du duc d’Albe à St. Sulpice, October 8, 1562,”\r\n_L’Ambassade de St. Sulpice_, 79; cf. 92, 93, 103.\r\n\r\n[603] Throckmorton, English ambassador in France, urgently pressed such\r\na policy, “even though it cost a million crowns” (_C. S. P. For._,\r\nNo. 418, August 4, 1562). It was in the form of alternative offers to\r\nthe Huguenots. Upon receipt of Havre-de-Grace, England was to deliver\r\nthree hostages in guaranty of the compact, to the count palatine of the\r\nRhine, and to pay in Strasburg 70,000 crowns; also to deliver at Dieppe\r\n40,000 crowns within twenty days after the receipt of Havre-de-Grace,\r\nand 30,000 crowns within twenty days following, to be employed by Condé\r\nupon the defenses of Rouen and Dieppe and in the rest of Normandy,\r\nwith the understanding that Havre-de-Grace was to be delivered to\r\nFrance upon the restoration of Calais, and the repayment of the 140,000\r\ncrowns advanced. The second offer was to this effect: Upon receipt\r\nof Havre-de-Grace, England was to deliver three hostages and deposit\r\n70,000 crowns in Germany, and to send 6,000 men into Normandy to serve\r\nat Rouen and Dieppe (_C. S. P. For._, No. 268, July, 1562; cf. Nos.\r\n662, 663). After prolonged negotiations which were conducted by the\r\nvidame of Chartres, the treaty of Hampton Court was framed on these\r\nlines, on September 10, 1562 (_Mém. de Condé_, III, 689; _Mém. du duc\r\nde Nevers_, I, 131; D’Aubigné, II, 79, 80). Elizabeth’s proclamation\r\nand justification of her action is at p. 693 of _Mém. de Condé_.\r\n\r\nThe alliance between the prince of Condé and the English, with the\r\nimplied loss of Calais to France, more than any other fact, reconciled\r\nCatherine de Medici to Spanish assistance. After August she personally\r\nurged this aid (_L’Ambassade de St. Sulpice_, 58, 59). Still Philip\r\nemphatically gave her to understand that “si l’ambassadeur de Espagne\r\navait fait espérer que son maître déclarerait la guerre aux Anglais il\r\navait dépassé ses instructions, car les Espagnols étaient depuis si\r\nlongtemps liés avec ces peuples qu’il était impossible de rompre cette\r\nalliance.”—St. Sulpice to Charles IX, November 12, 1562 (_L’Ambassade\r\nde St. Sulpice_, 93).\r\n\r\nThe constable was at Yvetot in October, 1562, at the time of the\r\ndescent of the English upon Havre and wrote to Charles IX that he was\r\nunable to take the field. At a later season he complains to Catherine\r\nof the calumnies heaped upon him, and bluntly says “that he is not in\r\nthe humor to endure such things.”—_Coll. de St. Pétersbourg_, CIII,\r\nletters pertaining to the house of Montmorency; La Ferrière, _Rapport_,\r\n46.\r\n\r\n[604] Archambault to St. Sulpice, _L’Ambassade de St. Sulpice_, 71;\r\nCharles IX to St. Sulpice, September 15, _ibid._, 74.

The soldiers were sent to Normandy via Montargis,\r\nAngerville-la-Rivière, and Etampes, leaving posts at Gien, Beaugency,\r\nand Pithiviers to keep the lines open between north and south and to\r\nprevent D’Andelot from getting to Orleans.\r\n\r\nOn the siege of Rouen, see Claude Haton, I, 286-89.

It was the middle portion\r\nwhich followed in ships up the river and was captured by Damville. The\r\nthird body was of the rear guard and returned to Havre-de-Grace (_C.\r\nS. P. Ven._, No. 302, October 14, 1562). In the fight off Caudebec 200\r\nEnglish were killed, and 80 made prisoners, all of whom were hanged\r\nby the French—a more rigorous punishment than even sixteenth-century\r\nwar nominally allowed (_ibid._, _For._, Nos. 870, 872, October 17, 18,\r\n1562).\r\n\r\n[612] _Ibid._, No. 901, October 23, 1562.\r\n\r\n[613] _C.

Claude Haton, I, 292, 293, has an interesting eulogy of him.\r\n\r\n[616] Charles IX and his mother were eye-witnesses of this struggle,\r\nviewing it from a window of the convent of St. Catherine “from which\r\nthey could see all that took place within and without the city.”—_C.\r\nS. P. Ven._, October 18, 1562.\r\n\r\n[617] It had been the queen’s hope that Rouen might be saved from sack,\r\nand with this object she had offered 70,000 francs to the French troops\r\nif they would refrain from pillage. But such a hope was slight, for\r\nRouen was the second city of the realm and one of great wealth (_C.\r\nS. P. Ven._, October 17, 1562). Moreover, “Guise proclaimed before\r\nthe assault that none should fall to any spoil before execution of\r\nman, woman, and child” (_ibid._, _For._, No. 920, Vaughan to Cecil,\r\nOctober 28, 1562). Catherine de Medici also throws the responsibility\r\nupon the duke of Guise (_Corresp._, I, 430). For other details of the\r\nsack, see Castelnau, Book III, chap. xii. “Le ravage de ceste ville fut\r\nà la mesure de sa grandeur et à sa richesse,” is D’Aubigné’s laconic\r\nstatement (II, 88). Fortunately, for the sake of humanity, the sack was\r\nstayed after the first day. The German troopers committed the worst\r\noutrages. The marshal Montmorency is to be given credit for mitigating\r\nthe horrors. Montgomery, though at first reported captured, escaped to\r\nHavre, having disguised himself by shaving off his beard (_C. S. P.\r\nFor._, No. 939, October 30, 1562), and abandoned his wife and children,\r\nto the indignation of Vaughan, who vented his outraged sentiments to\r\nCecil: “A man of that courage to steal away, leaving his wife and\r\nchildren behind him” (_ibid._, No. 920, October 28, 1562).\r\n\r\nAmong those in Rouen who were officially executed were a Huguenot\r\npastor by the name of Marlorat, with two elders of the church, a\r\nmerchant and burgess of the city, named Jean Bigot, and one Coton;\r\nMontreville, chief president of Rouen, De Cros, some time governor of\r\nHavre-de-Grace, eight Scotchmen who had passports of Mary Stuart to\r\nserve under Guise, and some French priests (D’Aubigné, II, 88; _C.

Almost all the weak\r\nplaces had been fortified with platforms, ravelins, and parapets. The\r\ncounterscarp was roughly finished. There were nine or ten cannon and\r\nculverins with a good store of powder. The greatest menace was the\r\nplague which daily diminished the number of the Protestants (_C. S.

The\r\nknowledge of his death was kept a secret for two days (_C. S. P. For._,\r\n1,079, November 20, 1562). The Spanish court wore mourning for four\r\ndays in honor of his memory (_L’Ambassade de St. Sulpice_, 103). He was\r\na “trimmer” to the last, on his deathbed professing the confession of\r\nAugsburg, as a doctrine intermediate between Catholicism and Calvinism\r\n(_Despatch of Barbaro_ [Huguenot Society], November 25, 1562).\r\n\r\n[623] “Le roi catholique est content que la reine mère ait l’entier\r\ngouvernement des affaires, tout en ayant près d’elle le cardinal de\r\nBourbon.”—_L’Ambassade de St. Sulpice_, 109, January 19, 1562 (1563).\r\n\r\n[624] “Il y eut toujours dans la ville quatre corps de garde, Charles\r\nIX ordonna d’établir à Etampes un magasin de vivre pour fournir son\r\narmée.”—_Annales du Gâtinais_, XIX, 105.\r\n\r\n[625] _C.

La Noue gives a motive which led Condé to besiege\r\nParis: “Non en intention de forcer la ville, mais pour faire les\r\nParisiens, qu’il estimoit les soufflets de la guerre et la cuisine dont\r\nelle se nourissoit.”—_Mém. milit. de la Noue_, chap. ix.\r\n\r\n[628] Charles IX to St. Sulpice December 11, 1562; _L’Ambassade de St.\r\nSulpice_, 98; _Despatch of Barbaro_ (Huguenot Society), December 7,\r\n1562.\r\n\r\n[629] Yet although the negotiations of the prince of Condé at this time\r\nwere tentative and the statements of the crown not intended by it to\r\nobtain, nevertheless the claims advanced are to be observed, because\r\nthe lines along which religious toleration was to develop in France and\r\nthe outlines of subsequent edicts of toleration, like those of Amboise,\r\nLongjumeau, and Bergerac, are foreshadowed in the articles proposed now.\r\n\r\nCondé first proposed the following three articles: (1) liberty of\r\nconscience with free exercise of religion where demanded; (2) security\r\nof life and property unto all; (3) the summons of a free council within\r\nsix months, or, if that were impossible, then a general assembly of\r\nthe realm. To these proposals the government replied that Calvinist\r\npreaching would not be permitted under any circumstances in Lyons\r\nand other frontier towns, which were defined, nor near those with a\r\ngovernor and garrison, nor in those towns which were seats of the\r\nparlements. Condé then modified the Huguenot demands, as follows: (1)\r\nThat Calvinist preaching be permitted in the suburbs of frontier towns,\r\nor in certain ones so appointed; (2) that it should obtain only in\r\nthose other places where it was practiced before the war began; (3)\r\nexcept that it should be lawful for all gentlemen and all nobles to\r\nhave private service in their own houses; (4) all persons residing in\r\nplaces where preaching was not permitted should be suffered to go to\r\nthe nearest towns or other places for the exercise of their religion,\r\nwithout molestation. In reply, the government excepted Paris and the\r\n_banlieue_ from these stipulations. All these conditions the government\r\nand Condé accepted on December 3, 1562, Lyons being declared _not_ to\r\nbe a frontier city within the construction of the articles. Certain\r\nminor stipulations followed as to amnesty, recovery of property, etc.\r\nCf. _C. S. P. For._, No. 1,219, December 9, 1562; Beza, _Hist. des\r\néglises réformées_, II, 121 ff., ed. 1841.\r\n\r\n[630] “M. de Nevers has already here from 800 to 1,000 horse. They\r\nlook for 600 foot and horsemen, Spaniards and Gascons and Piedmontese,\r\nto arrive shortly. All this while they had driven the prince off\r\nwith talk.”—_C. S. P. For._, 1,168, December 1, 1562—Smith to\r\nThrockmorton. These reinforcements reached Paris on the night of\r\nDecember 7, 1562; there were 10 ensigns of Gascons (40 or 50 in an\r\nensign), in all about 500 or 600 men; of the Spaniards, 14 ensigns,\r\n“better filled,” about 2,500-3,000, all footmen, and few armed. Their\r\nweapons were arquebuses and pikes, and some bills and halberds. “With\r\nthem a marvellous number of rascals, women and baggage” (Smith to\r\nCecil, _C. S. P. For._, No. 1,205, December 7, 1562; cf. Barbaro\r\n[Huguenot Society], December 7, 1562. The Venetian ambassador went out\r\nto view them). These reinforcements are much exaggerated in the _Mém.\r\nde Condé_ (V, 103, 104, ed. London), which rates the Gascons as 3,000\r\nand the Spaniards as 4,000.\r\n\r\n[631] _C. S. P. Ven._, December 3 and 14, 1562. For an extreme example\r\nof Chantonnay’s overbearing policy, see Barbaro’s account of a\r\nconversation with the Spanish ambassador in the letter of January 25,\r\n1563.\r\n\r\n[632] _Ibid._, _For._, 1,183, December 3, 1562; No. 1,238, §7, December\r\n13, 1562. It is fair to say, though, that Condé was almost without\r\nartillery, having but eight guns, so that there was no possibility of\r\nbreaking the wall. The only way to take the city would have been by an\r\nassault with scaling-ladders (letter of Hotman in _Rev. hist._, XCVII,\r\nMarch-April, 1908, 311).\r\n\r\n[633] Claude Haton, I, 307; _C. S. P. Ven._, No. 314, December 11,\r\n1562. See Throckmorton’s earnest plea in _C. S. P. For._, 1,195,\r\nDecember 6, 1562, for sending financial assistance to him. The English\r\nintervention in Normandy was demonstrated to be a safe and profitable\r\nventure; besides other advantages which they might draw from Rouen,\r\nHavre, and Dieppe (which could safely be recovered) the archbishopric\r\nof Rouen was worth 50,000 francs; the two abbeys inside the town\r\n10,000; the abbey of Fécamp 40,000 francs; the benefices within the\r\ntown valuable; the _gabelle_ in salt and other royal rights in Rouen\r\nand Dieppe worth 50,000 crowns, which would double when the English\r\nmerchants came, so that the military occupation of Normandy would cost\r\nless than the profits therefrom. But arguments were in vain to persuade\r\nElizabeth’s double policy of caution and parsimony. Sir Nicholas drove\r\nSmith’s warning of December 7 home by another one to Elizabeth, urging\r\nher “to deal substantially” with Condé, “for wanting the queen’s force\r\nof men it is not likely he will be strong enough to accomplish his\r\nintents.”\r\n\r\n[634] Too late the English government was alive to the danger of\r\nits losing all, owing to the narrow policy hitherto pursued, and\r\nCecil hurried Richard Worseley, captain of the Isle of Wight, off to\r\nPortsmouth on December 7 to secure 5,000 pounds, as earnest of more\r\nmoney to be sent into France in aid of the Huguenots, whence he was to\r\nhasten to Havre, warn the earl of Warwick not to give credit to any\r\nreports of peace unless so informed by Throckmorton or Smith, and see\r\nthat the town was speedily fortified and guarded (_C. S. P. For._, No.\r\n1,033, December 7, 1562; Forbes, II, 124, 125).\r\n\r\n[635] Claude Haton, I, 307; _C. S. P. For._, No. 1,240, December 13,\r\n1562.\r\n\r\n[636] _C. S. P.

(See Appendix V.) Montgomery was in\r\nPortsmouth with Sir Hugh Poulet, who was commissioned to bring over the\r\nbalance of 15,000 pounds to Havre (_C. S. P.

The\r\nduke of Aumale was unhorsed and nearly the whole army rode and trampled\r\nover him, yet he was unhurt, owing to the heavy suit of armor he wore\r\n(_ibid._, _For._, No. 375, §3, 1563; cf. No. 400, §2).\r\n\r\n[645] The Parlement ordered the bishops of France to declare that in\r\nall parishes those who knew who were Huguenots should denounce them\r\nwithin nine days to their priests under pain of excommunication.

But if he be now aided with 10,000 men and 200,000 crowns,\r\nfurther inconvenience will be stayed and may serve a better purpose\r\nthan the employment at another time of a far greater number at larger\r\ncharges.

He was also to find the count\r\nof Tendes and Sommerive and express the King’s displeasure of their\r\nconduct.

Charles IX was firmly resolved to enforce\r\nthe national traditions of the French monarchy with reference to the\r\npapacy. The fearless speech of Du Ferrier occasioned a sensation in\r\nthe council. France was accused of wishing, like England, to secede\r\nfrom Rome and found a national church and it was even proposed to hand\r\nthe ambassador over to the Inquisition (Frémy, _Un ambassadeur libéral\r\nsous Charles IX et Henri III_, 1880, p. 49). So energetic were the\r\nremonstrances of Lansac that he was derisively called the “ambassador\r\nof the Huguenots” (Frémy, 21).\r\n\r\nOn April 15, 1563, the King wrote to the cardinal of Lorraine to\r\ninform him that, having grown impatient at the slowness of the Council\r\nof Trent, he was sending the president Biragues to Trent and then to\r\nthe Emperor with a mission to have the council transferred to a freer\r\nplace if possible. The King declared that if the reforms demanded by\r\nChristianity were not accorded and confirmed by the council, France\r\nwould not hesitate to convoke a national council. (See the instruction\r\nto D’Oysel in _Corresp. de Catherine de Médicis_, II, 1-3, note.)\r\n\r\n[699] “Articles de l’alégation de messieurs les ambassadeurs, estant de\r\npresent à la cour; envoyez, l’un par nostre saint père le Pape, l’autre\r\npar l’Empereur, Roy des Romains, l’autre par le Roy d’Espaigne, et le\r\nPrince de Piedmont.

The whole council\r\nwas filled with disaffection; 150 out of the 230 members present\r\nwere Italians, most of these pensioners of Rome, so that the others\r\nresented their preponderance (Lansac to St. Sulpice, February 10, 1563,\r\n_L’Ambassade de St. Sulpice_, 115).\r\n\r\nThere were conflicts as to precedence; some of the ambassadors\r\nlike Lansac and Du Ferrier believed in qualified toleration of\r\nProtestants (St. Sulpice, 115); many of the members, while believing\r\nin the enlargement of the Pope’s prerogatives in religious affairs,\r\nwere opposed to a reduction of governmental rights of control over\r\necclesiastical temporalities. Philip II’s attitude in this respect was\r\nidentical with that of Charles IX—each wanted to exercise political\r\ncontrol over the church within his kingdom (St. Sulpice, 198). Even\r\nthe cardinal of Lorraine was an advocate of temporal independence\r\n(St. Sulpice, 161). See Baschet, _Journal du Concile de Trente_; the\r\nAppendix has a valuable bibliography of the history of the Council of\r\nTrent. M. Baguenault de la Puchesse’ article in _R. Q. H._, 1869, may\r\nbe added. The cardinal of Lorraine left Trent on March 23. M. Baschet\r\nquestions (p. 214): “Que sont devenues toutes les dépêches qu’il a du\r\nécrire à la Reine mère, tant sur sa négociation avec l’Empereur, que\r\nsur sa visite à la Republique de Venise et son voyage en Cour de Rome,\r\npour l’accomplissement desquels il s’était deplacé de sa résidence au\r\nConcile?” He was not aware of the fact, when he wrote in 1870, that\r\nCount Hector de la Ferrière had shortly before discovered them in the\r\narchives at St. Petersburg (La Ferrière, _Deux années de mission à\r\nSaint Petersbourg_, 51).

There was\r\nmuch sickness. Food was scarce. “The estate of victuals here,” wrote\r\nthe earl to the Privy Council on April 30, “rests now upon a scarce\r\nproportion of one month in bread and corn (of beer we can make no\r\nfurther account than as long as we are masters of water, to brew),\r\nhaving neither flesh, fish, butter, nor cheese, nor any meat of the\r\nqueen’s store but bacon for two days. The clerk of the store here is\r\nas bare in money as victuals.... The enemy’s chief hope for taking\r\nthis town rests upon famine.”—_C. S. P. For._, No. 676; Forbes, II,\r\n402. Warwick pointed out, however, that if the queen “would put forth\r\na power upon the sea” and keep the mouth of the Seine open, as well as\r\nprevent relief from being brought from Flanders and Brittany, Havre\r\nmight be saved. “Their whole relief must come to them by Picardy side,\r\nwhich will not suffice long; neither can they be victualled by land any\r\nway, if the commodities of the seas be by this means taken away.”—_C.\r\nS.

In January, 1563, a\r\nCorsican, resident in Spain, by the name of Pietro Paolo del Delfino\r\noffered his services to St. Sulpice. “Il va dans l’eau,” wrote the\r\nambassador to Catherine, “et m’a assuré qu’avec certains engins il\r\nempéchera que nul navire venant d’Angleterre puisse aborder aud. Havre\r\nsans grand danger.” In June Delfino arrived at Bois de Vincennes, where\r\nhe was well received, according to his own statement (_L’Ambassade de\r\nSt. Sulpice_, 112, and n. 4). But I do not find any further mention of\r\nhim. Was this invention a sort of torpedo? We know that shells were\r\nfirst used in the siege of Orleans in this year.\r\n\r\n[725] _C. S. P.

Charles IX was born on June 17, 1550, so that he\r\nwas _in his fourteenth year_, though not yet fourteen years old. The\r\nParlement of Paris for more than a month refused to register the edict,\r\nnot on political, but on religious grounds. It objected to “la mention\r\nde l’édit de pacification d’Amboise, introduite sans motif dans la\r\ndéclaration de l’édit de la majorité, ce _que semblait reconnaître deux\r\nreligions_.”—_Correspondance de Catherine de Médicis_, II, Introd.,\r\nxxiv. The Venetian ambassador gives an interesting character-sketch of\r\nCharles IX at this time (_Rel. vén._, I, 419).\r\n\r\n[747] The estates of Burgundy declared in a memorial that it was\r\nimpossible to maintain double worship in France and petitioned that\r\nProtestant worship might be abolished in that province, May 18, 1563\r\n(D’Aubigné, II, 205; _Mém. de Condé_, IV, 413; Castelnau, Book V, chap.\r\nvi.)\r\n\r\n[748] “S’étaient tous départis avec une hâte extrème causée sur la\r\ndisposition du pape.”—Testu to Catherine de Medici, _L’Ambassade\r\nde St. Sulpice_, 207. “Les évêques français se déclarent obligés de\r\npartir, se voyant privés de ressources.”—Baschet, _Journal du Concile\r\nde Trente_, 239.\r\n\r\n[749] The Pope sent the bishop of Vintimilla to Spain to persuade\r\nPhilip II to enforce the Tridentine decrees in favor of the\r\ncounter-Reformation (_L’Ambassade de St. Sulpice_, 174, 200, 217, 218).\r\nSee also a letter of Luna, Philip II’s ambassador at Trent, of November\r\n17, 1563, in _Correspondencia de los principes de Alemania con Felipe\r\nII, y de los Embajadores de Este en la Corti di Vienna (1556-98)_ in\r\n“Documentos inéditos,” CI, 24.\r\n\r\n[750] _Annales Raynaldi_, 1564, No. 1; Labbé, XIV, 939; cf. _R.

In Vol.\r\nLXXXVI, _Coll. de St. Pétersbourg_, is a collection of letters, many of\r\nthem from Lansac and the cardinal of Lorraine while at the Council of\r\nTrent.

Catherine makes no allusion to this\r\nscene in her letter to Elizabeth of Spain at this season (_L’Ambassade\r\nde St. Sulpice_, 237). But on a subsequent occasion, when the cardinal\r\nof Lorraine dropped the remark that the Council of Trent ought to be\r\ncalled _Spanish_, the queen mother replied “qu’il avait raison, et\r\nque aussi lui même s’était montré tel et plus de ce parti que de tout\r\nautre.”—_Ibid._, 383.\r\n\r\n[753] _R.

Tosc._, III, 492.\r\n\r\n[763] _Papiers d’état du cardinal de Granvelle_, VI, 620, September 13,\r\n1563. It is interesting to observe the objections of Margaret of Parma\r\nand Granvella. According to the former, “l’impossibilité de donner\r\nsecours au roi de France était notoire, à moins qu’on ne voulût la\r\nperte et la ruine totale des Pays-Bas.”—Gachard, _Philippe II et les\r\nPays-Bas_, I, 211; Margaret to Philip, August 6, from Brussels. The\r\nlatter deplores the reduction of the forces of the country because “les\r\nligues et confédérations (c’est ainsi qu’on les appelle) formées contre\r\nlui, continuent.”—_Ibid._, August 6, 1562. Three future patriots of\r\nthe Netherlands were in this session of the Council of State—William\r\nof Orange, Egmont and Hoorne. Cf. Gachard’s note.\r\n\r\n[764] La Popelinière, Book viii, 499; _Rel. vén._ II, 99.\r\n\r\n[765] “Cependant la ligue ne s’est pas renfermée dans l’enceinte de\r\nParis. Paris, qui l’avait incertaine et hesitante encore, la renvoya\r\naux provinces, toute brûlante et toute armée. Elle s’associa à leur\r\nintérêts, réfléta leur passions et leur caractère, feroce en Languedoc,\r\ndurement obstinée en Bretagne, partout modifiée dans sa nature et sa\r\ndurée par la politique locale des municipalités.”—Ouvré, _Essai sur\r\nl’histoire de la ligue à Poitiers_ (1855), 6.\r\n\r\n[766] Ranke, _Civil Wars and Monarchy in France_, 226, notices this\r\ncontrast between the north and the south.\r\n\r\n[767] This local organization did not seem strong enough for Montluc,\r\nwhose activity against the Protestants in 1562 was already notable\r\nand who was suspicious lest some Huguenots might creep into the\r\nbody and betray it; so the power was taken out of the hands of the\r\n_jurats_ of the city at his suggestion and vested in the hands of\r\nTilladet, governor of Bordeaux, who also had possession of the keys\r\nof the city. This proceeding was destined to be revolutionary in the\r\ndevelopment of the municipality. The _jurats_ pleaded their ancient\r\nprivileges, which were as old as the English domination, which Louis\r\nXI had confirmed after the wars of the English in France were over.\r\nBut the parlement of Bordeaux approved the change and thus the form of\r\ngovernment of the greatest city of the Gironde was altered by stress\r\nof circumstances (O’Reilly, _Hist. de Bordeaux_, II, 241-44; Montluc,\r\n_Lettres et commentaires_, IV, 214, note). Cf. Gaullieur, _Histoire de\r\nla réformation à Bordeaux et dans le ressort du parlement de Guyenne_.\r\nTome I, “Les origines et la première guerre de religion jusqu’à la paix\r\nd’Amboise” (1523-63), Paris, 1848.\r\n\r\n[768] “Tellement que les pauvres fidèles trembloyent dans Aix et\r\nplusieurs firent constraints de s’enfuyr.”—_Mém. de.

Cf. _Discours\r\nvéritable des guerre et troubles advenus au Pays de Provence en l’an\r\n1562._\r\n\r\n[769] This was Henri Damville, the second son of the constable\r\nMontmorency.\r\n\r\n[770] This association, in the words of D’Aubigné, was the “prototype\r\net premier example de toutes les ligues qui ont despuis paru en\r\nFrance.”—Vol. II, 137. Extended accounts of its origin may be found in\r\nthe _Annales de Toulouse_, II, 62 ff.; De Thou, IV, Book XXXIV, 496,\r\n497; La Popelinière, Book VIII, 602, gives the text of the compact,\r\nwhich shows the financial measures adopted in the support of the\r\nleague; _Lettres et commentaires de Montluc_, ed.

In 1212 in the course of the war against the Albigenses\r\nthe “Confraternitas ad ecclesiae defensionem Massiliae instituta”\r\nwas formed at Marseilles by Arnaud, the papal legate.

There is a\r\ncopious bibliography prefixed to the work. The article by M. Hauser\r\nreferred to in the _American Historical Review_, January, 1899, should\r\nalso be examined.\r\n\r\n[782] Weiss, _La chambre ardente_, cxlv. The early identification of\r\nthe French nobility with Calvinism has been exaggerated. One must be\r\ncautious in the use of the term “nobility,” for it is to be remembered\r\nthat the eldest son received the largest share of the inheritance and\r\nthat younger sons and small nobles, in many instances, had much in\r\ncommon with the small farmers in the provinces. As Mr. Armstrong aptly\r\nsays: “All that separated them from their neighbors was ‘privilege,’\r\nand to this they clung all the more desperately.”—Armstrong, _The\r\nFrench Wars of Religion_, 4. In the decade between 1550 and 1560\r\nthere is an increase in the number of aristocratic names identified\r\nwith French Protestantism, but it was not till 1557 that the first\r\ngreat noble espoused its cause and that covertly. This was Antoine of\r\nBourbon. In the same year Coligny and D’Andelot also inclined to it\r\n(Whitehead, _Gaspard de Coligny, Admiral of France_, 63-66). On the\r\nwhole matter, see Lavisse, _Histoire de France_, V, Pt. II, 238-42.\r\n\r\n[783] Relazione IV, 242. The great store-house of information on this\r\nhead is M. Noel Weiss, _La chambre ardente_, 1889—the trials for\r\nheresy during the years 1547-49 of the reign of Henry II—a book which\r\nhas revolutionized the point of view of the history of the French\r\nReformation (see a review of this work in _English Hist. Review_, VI,\r\n770).\r\n\r\nIn the town of Provins there were but a few Huguenots. Among them\r\nwere 1 doctor; 2 lawyers; a notary; 1 barber and surgeon; 1 dyer; 3\r\napothecaries; 1 draper; 1 fuller; 1 salt dealer.—Claude Haton, I, 124,\r\n125.\r\n\r\n[784] It would be a narrow view of the history of France at this time\r\nto infer that religious and economic changes were the only sort. The\r\ntruth is, the reigns of Francis I and of Henry II, were an age of\r\ntransition in religion, in institutions, even in manners.\r\n\r\n“La corruption des bonnes mœurs a continué en tous estatz, tant\r\necclesiastique que aultres, depuis les cardinaux jusques aux simples\r\nprebstres, et depuis le roy jusques aux simples villagloix. Chascun\r\na voulu suyvre son plaisir; on a délaissé mesme l’ancienne coustume\r\nde s’habiller. De temps immémorial, nul homme de France n’avoit esté\r\ntondu ni porté longue barbe avant le régne dudit feu roy; ains tous\r\nles hommes, garçons et campagnons portoient longs cheveux et la\r\nbarbe rasée au menton.... Les prebstres et évesques se sont faict\r\ntondre des derniers; et ont porté longue barbe, ce qui a esté trouve\r\nfort estranger depuis le commencement du règne dudit feu roy, ont\r\ncommencé les nouvelles façons aux habillemens toutes contraires à\r\nl’antiquité, et a semblé la France estre ung nouveau peuple ou ung\r\nmonde renouvelé.”—Claude Haton, I, 112.\r\n\r\n[785] The _cahier_ of the estates of Orleans was published at the eve\r\nof the French Revolution (_Recueil des cahiers généraux des trois\r\nordres_, chap. i).\r\n\r\n[786] Isambert, XIV, 63 ff.\r\n\r\n[787] I am indebted for much of this information to M.

Ces premières\r\nligues ont seulement un but religieux. Elles sont généralement\r\ncomposées de bourgeois dévoué à la royauté et sincèrement émus des\r\ndangers auxquels est exposé la catholicisme.”—_La grande encyc._,\r\nXXII, 234, _s. v._ “Ligue,” article by M. de Vaissière.\r\n\r\n“La jalousie entre les deux Religions ne se borna pas l’émulation\r\nd’une plus grande régularité; elles cherchèrent s’appuyer l’une\r\ncontre l’autre de la force des confédérations et des serments. Depuis\r\nlongtemps la Romaine entretenoit dans son sein des associations connues\r\nsous le nom de confréries. Elles avoient des lieux et des jours\r\nd’assemblée fixés, une police, des repas, des exercices, des deniers\r\ncommuns. Il ne fut question que d’ajouter à ce la un serment d’employer\r\nses biens et sa vie pour la défense de la Foi attaquée. Avec cette\r\nformule, les confréries devinrent comme d’elles-mêmes, dans chaque\r\nville, des corps de troupes prêtes à agir au gré des chefs, et leur\r\nbannières, des étendarts militaires.”—Anquetil, I, 213.\r\n\r\n[790] Coligny expressly denied having made any promise to return\r\nCalais to England, and as to the occupation of Havre, he said: “J’en\r\nignorais les termes jusqu’à la venue de Throckmorton en Normandie, et\r\nlorsque j’en ai signé la confirmation, je n’ai jamais pu croire qu’il\r\ny eut autre clause que l’assurance donnée à la reine du remboursement\r\ndes sommes qu’elle nous avançait.”—_Correspondance de Catherine de\r\nMédicis_, II, Introd., xiii. See the extended discussion of this\r\ncontroverted subject in Whitehead, _Gaspard de Coligny_, Appendix I,\r\nwhere he shows that the admiral is to be exonerated from the odium of\r\nhaving sought to betray Havre-de-Grace into the hands of the English\r\nand puts the blame for this article of the treaty of Hampton Court upon\r\nthe vidame de Chartres.\r\n\r\n[791] The conduct of La Rochelle in the fourth civil war is the\r\nmost pronounced instance of Huguenot willingness to subordinate\r\nFrench territory to a foreign domination and this action was of the\r\nmunicipality, not of a single Huguenot leader, nor did it, of course,\r\nimply the subjection of the government of France to English rule as the\r\nTriumvirate contemplated in the case of Spain.\r\n\r\n[792] _Mém. de Condé_, IV, 93: “Traicté d’Association faicte par\r\nMonseigneur le Prince de Condé avec les Princes, Chevaliers de l’Ordre,\r\nSeigneurs, Capitaines, Gentilhommes et autres de tous estats, qui sont\r\nentrez, ou entreront cy-apres, en la dicte association, pour maintenir\r\nl’honneur de Dieu, le repos de ce royaume, et l’estat et liberté du Roy\r\nsous le gouvernement de la Roy sa mere.”\r\n\r\nThe third article provides for implicit obedience to the prince of\r\nCondé, “chef et conducteur de toute la Compagnie,” i. e., the army;\r\n_there was no league_. Minute regulations follow for the government of\r\nthe camp, for services of prayer both morning and evening, etc. The\r\nfourth article, which has to do with the ways and means of raising\r\nrevenue, is the nearest approach to _political_ organization: “ ...\r\nnous jurons and promettons devant Dieu et ses Anges nous tenir prests\r\nde tout ce qui fait en nostre pouvoir, comme d’argent; d’armes, chevaux\r\nde service, et toutes les autres choses requises, pour nous trouver\r\nau premier Mandement du dict Seigneur Prince.”—_Mém. de Condé_, III,\r\n210-15. Cf. La Popelinière, Book VIII, 582 ff., upon the same subject.\r\n\r\n[793] In 1567 when the Huguenot chiefs tried to seize Charles IX\r\nby surprise at Meaux, thus precipitating the second civil war, the\r\nVenetian ambassador, Correro, expressed astonishment at the perfection\r\nof the Huguenot organization (_Rel. vén._, II, 115).\r\n\r\n[794] Edit de confirmation de l’édit de pacification du 19 Mars\r\n1562, sec. 6: “Nous ... prohibons et défendons, sur peine de crime\r\nde leze-majesté à tous nos dits sujets, quels qu’ils soient, qu’ils\r\nn’ayent à faire practique, avoir intelligence, envoyer ne recevoir\r\nlettres ne messages, escrire en chiffre n’autre escriture feincte,\r\nne desguisée, à princes estrangers, ne aucuns de leur subjects et\r\nserviteurs, pour chose concernant nostre estat sans nostre sceu et\r\nexprès congé et permission.”—Isambert, _Recueil des lois_, XIV, 145;\r\nthe “Ordonnance explicative” of April 7 is on p. 333; cf. _Mém. de\r\nCondé_, IV, 311; La Popelinière, Book X, 724.\r\n\r\n[795] We find repeated orders for their dissolution, e. g., F. Fr.\r\n15,876, fol. 201.\r\n\r\n[796] Lettres-patentes of Charles IX extended the right of Protestant\r\nworship to Condom, St. Sevère, and Dax, towns which did not figure in\r\nthe edict of March 19 (Ruble, _Commentaires et lettres de Montluc_, IV,\r\n257, 272, and notes). A royal ordinance was later issued giving a list\r\nof those towns where Calvinist worship was permitted, specifying that\r\nit must be conducted in the faubourgs, however (_Mém. de Condé_, IV,\r\n338).\r\n\r\n[797] Within a month the government received anonymous information\r\nof Candalle’s activity (_Archives de la Gironde_, XXI, 14 [April 16,\r\n1563]). Cf. “Lettre de Candalle à la reine, du mai 20, 1563” (F. Fr.\r\n15,875, fol. 495). In the same volume, fol. 491, is a joint declaration\r\nof the gentlemen of Guyenne upon the purposes of this association.\r\n\r\n[798] _Commentaires et lettres de Montluc_, IV, 214.\r\n\r\n[799] _Correspondance de Catherine de Médicis_, I, 552, col. 2. At\r\nthe same time Catherine wrote to certain members of the Parlement\r\nof Bordeaux. Montluc’s reply, both the personal letter he wrote to\r\nthe queen mother (April 11), and the more official remonstrance he\r\nforwarded to the King, is a palpable lie. He wrote to the queen\r\n“Je vous puis asseurer ... que despuis la nouvelle de la paix, il\r\nn’y a eu traicté d’association aucune; que, au moindre mot que\r\nj’en ay dict, tout ne soit cessé comme s’il n’en avoit jamais\r\nesté parle.”—_Commentaires et lettres_, IV, 206. Cf. his similar\r\ndeclaration to Charles IX, on p. 214. The clergy of Bordeaux sustained\r\nMontluc in this deception, and when the queen’s suspicion continued,\r\njustified the association on the ground of religion. _Corresp. de\r\nCatherine de Méd._, I, 552, note. Candalle in a letter of May 20,\r\n1563, still evaded the truth in writing to the queen (F. Fr., 15,876,\r\nfol. 495), and Catherine, upon more suspicious information from\r\nd’Escars, determined to satisfy herself of certain facts, and sent two\r\ncommissioners to Guyenne to secure better information (_Commentaires et\r\nlettres de Montluc_, IV, 270, note). Unfortunately for the government,\r\nthe Parlement of Bordeaux resented their coming as an invasion of their\r\njurisdiction, and the inquiry degenerated into a quarrel between the\r\nParlement and the commissioners (_ibid._, IV, 292, n. 1; _Corresp. de\r\nCatherine de Médicis_, II, 114, 115).\r\n\r\n[800] Claude Haton, I, 266.\r\n\r\n[801] “A Lyon, les catholiques y sont pour le jour d’huy en plus\r\ngrand nombre des troiz partz pour une que les huguenotz; mais les\r\ndits huguenotz sont les principaulx et ceulx qui ont les forces en\r\nmains.”—Granvella to the emperor Ferdinand I, April 12, 1564, _Papiers\r\nd’état du cardinal de Granvelle_, VII, 467.\r\n\r\n[802] The coast trade with England and Holland probably explains the\r\nprevalence of Protestantism in Lower Normandy, at least in part. But\r\nthe reasons of the prevalence of rural Huguenotism on an extensive\r\nscale in Normandy are quite obscure. On this subject see La Ferrière,\r\n_Normandie à l’étranger_, 2-5, 82; Hauser, “The French Reformation\r\nand the French People in the Sixteenth Century,” _American Historical\r\nReview_, January 1899, 225, 226.\r\n\r\n[803] Hauser, _op. cit._, 226, 227. I find in Montluc an interesting\r\nallusion to the prevalence of the Reformed belief among the peasantry\r\nof Guyenne, which M. Hauser has not noticed. It occurs in a letter of\r\n“Instruction au cappitaine Monluc [Pierre-Bertrand, called captain\r\nPeyrot] de ce qu’il dira à la royne et au roy de Navarre, de la part du\r\nsieur de Monluc, touchant l’état de Guyenne,” March 25, 1561, and is as\r\nfollows: “Et ce, à cause des insollences, scandalles et contemnements\r\nque _les paisans_ dudit païs leur ont faict depuis ung an en cà,”\r\netc.—_Commentaires et lettres de Montluc_, IV, 115.\r\n\r\n[804] Hauser, “The French Reformation and the French People in the\r\nSixteenth Century,” _American Hist.

Hence came the propagandism, the organization for victory,\r\nthe reorganization after defeat, the _esprit de corps_, the religious\r\nzeal which whipped up flagging political or military energies.”\r\n\r\n[823] See a letter of Alva in K. 1,502. Montluc later informed Philip\r\nII of it (_Commentaires et lettres_, V, 25, letter of June, 1565). The\r\nrumor seems not to have passed unheeded, for the marshal Vieilleville\r\ncautioned the King and his mother to be moderate in their course,\r\nsaying that the Huguenots were many and the soldiers few (_Papiers\r\nd’état du cardinal de Granvelle_, VIII, 632).

Another match,\r\nproposed simply for the purpose of leading Condé along, was between\r\nthe young duke of Guise and the prince’s daughter, Margaret, who was\r\na little child.—_C. S. P. For._, No. 642, §3; Smith to Cecil from\r\nValence, September 1, 1564; No. 650, _ibid._, September 3, 1564; No.\r\n784, November 7, 1564. Smith to Cecil: “News is that the prince of\r\nCondé and the cardinal of Lorraine have intervisited each other.” Cf.\r\n_Papiers d’état du cardinal de Granvelle_, VIII, 127. Bolwiller who\r\ndisapproved of these plans in the interest of Philip II (_ibid._,\r\nVIII, 381, note) evidently believed the prince won over to Catholicism\r\n(_ibid._, VIII, 156). A propos of Condé’s relapse he sarcastically\r\nwrote to Granvella on July 8, 1564: “Ce que l’on est en oppinion que\r\nL’Admiral et D’Andelot se doibvent renger et hanger leur robbe, si le\r\nfont, lors me semblera-il veoir une vraye farce, et pourront les femmes\r\ndire lors estre dadvantaige constante que les hommes, mesme madame de\r\nVandosme et duchesse de Ferrare demeurans en l’oppinion où l’on les\r\nvoid.”—_Ibid._, VIII, 129.\r\n\r\n[861] _Corresp. de Catherine de Médicis_, II, 106, note; _L’Ambassade\r\nde St. Sulpice_, 164; _C. S. P. Scot._, II, 153, Randolph to Cecil,\r\nMarch 1-3, 1565. Mary Stuart in 1564 was twenty-two years of age,\r\nCharles IX barely fourteen (_Papiers d’état du card. de Granvelle_,\r\nVIII, 347, note).\r\n\r\n[862] Cf. the luminous letter of Philip to Granvella, August 6, 1564,\r\nin _Papiers d’état du card. de Granvelle_, VIII, 215, 216.\r\n\r\n[863] _C. S. P. Ven._, November 6, 1575.\r\n\r\n[864] Fortunately for Philip, a whim of passion helped the Spanish\r\nKing’s purposes, and Catherine and the Guises failing to carry the\r\nmatch between Mary Stuart and the prince were content to keep the\r\nprince alienated from his party. The prince of Condé had become\r\nenamored of one of the queen mother’s maids-of-honor, Isabel Limeuil,\r\nwhile the court was at Roussillon, and had seduced her.\r\n\r\nOn this liaison see _Corresp. de Cath. de Méd._, II, 189, note; Louis\r\nParis, _Négociations_, Introd. XXVI, XXVII; _Nég. Tosc._, III, 572, and\r\nespecially La Ferrière, “Isabel de Limeuil,” _Revue des deux mondes_,\r\nDecember 1, 1883, 636 and the duc d’Aumale, _Histoire des princes de\r\nCondé_, I, Appendix, xix. A suggestion of the manners prevailing at\r\ncourt is found in the following information: “Orders are taken in the\r\ncourt that no gentleman shall talk with the queen’s maids, except it\r\nis in the queen’s presence, or in that of Madame la Princesse de la\r\nRoche-sur-Yon, _except he be married_; and if they sit upon a form or\r\nstool, he may sit by her, and if she sits in the form, he may kneel by\r\nher, _but not lie long_, as the fashion was in this court.”—_C. S. P.\r\nFor._, 1091, April 11, 1565.\r\n\r\n[865] Unknown to Charles IX, the Spanish ambassador Chantonnay, whose\r\nrecall Catherine had insisted upon for months past and who was finally\r\nreplaced late in 1564 by Alava, traversed the provinces of France in\r\ndisguise, in the interest of his master, journeying through Auvergne,\r\nRouergue, Toulouse, Agen and Bordeaux, before he reported at Madrid for\r\nnew duty.\r\n\r\nSt. Sulpice to Catherine de Medici, June 12, 1564; _L’Ambassade de\r\nSt. Sulpice_, 711; _Papiers d’état du cardinal de Granvelle_, VII,\r\n592.

Philip\r\nII, far from wishing war with France, repudiated his ambassador’s\r\nstatements (_R. Q. H._, January, 1879, p. 23).\r\n\r\n[866] Upon one of the fits of madness of Don Carlos see letter of the\r\nBishop of Limoges to Catherine de Medici in La Ferrière, _Rapport_,\r\n48, 49. The Raumer Letters from Paris, Vol. I, chap. xv, contain an\r\ninteresting account of Don Carlos, with long extracts from the sources.\r\nThe editor rightly says that Ranke in his treatise on the affair of Don\r\nCarlos, as acute as it is circumstantial, has adopted the only right\r\nconclusion for the solution of this mysterious episode of history.

Philip found a new prospective husband for\r\nMary Stuart in the person of the archduke Charles. He had abandoned the\r\nidea of marrying Mary Stuart to his son even before the death of Don\r\nCarlos.\r\n\r\n[868] See _R. Q. H._, XXXIV, 461.\r\n\r\n[869] Catherine turned to her own advantage an almost forgotten wish\r\nof Philip II that he might see her, expressed in July, 1560, when his\r\nanxiety was great because of her lenient policy toward the French\r\nProtestants (_R. Q. H._, XXXIV, 458).\r\n\r\n[870] Challoner, English ambassador to Spain, to the queen: “Hardly\r\nshall a stranger by his countenance or words gather at any great\r\nalteration of mind, either to anger, or rejoicement, but after the\r\nfashion of a certain still flood;” quoted by Forneron, I, 319, n. 2,\r\nfrom Record Office MSS No. 466.\r\n\r\n[871] See the extremely interesting account of the passing of the\r\nTurkish embassy through Provins, in Claude Haton, I, 342-44.\r\n\r\n[872] On the conspiracy of Bajazet and his flight to Persia see\r\nD’Aubigné, Book III, chap. xxviii.\r\n\r\n[873] _Négociations dans le Levant_, II, 729.\r\n\r\n[874] _Ibid._, 730.\r\n\r\n[875] Spain suspected the Sultan was desirous of securing a French\r\nroadstead for his fleet during the siege of Malta.

On September 27,\r\n1564, the prévôt Morillon wrote to the cardinal Granvella: “L’édit de\r\nFrance contre les apostatz me faict espérer que la royne mère passera\r\nplus avant, puisque la saison est à propos; et si elle ne le faict, je\r\ncrains qu’elle et les siens le paieront.”—_Papiers d’état du card. de\r\nGranvelle_, VIII, 361.\r\n\r\n[885] Castelnau Book V, chap. x. Granvella expressed impatience at\r\nCatherine’s slowness in repressing the Huguenots. See his letters to\r\nvice-chancellor Seld and Philip II at this time in _Papiers d’état du\r\ncardinal de Granvelle_, VIII, 598, 599, 632, 633.\r\n\r\n[886] Unless the order forbidding Renée of Ferrara to hold Protestant\r\nservice even in private while at the court, be taken as the first; see\r\n_R.

On the last complaint see _Correspondance\r\nde Catherine de Médicis_, II, 195, 203, and notes. These Catholic\r\nassociations generally at this time went by the name of “Confréries du\r\nSt. Esprit,” as D’Aubigné’s allusion shows.\r\n\r\n[890] For an episode showing at once the manners of some in the court,\r\nand the Catholic intensity of the people of Marseilles, see _Papiers\r\nd’état du cardinal de Granvelle_, VIII, 475.\r\n\r\n[891] Lamathe, “Délibération des consuls de Nismes au sujet de l’entrée\r\nde Charles IX dans ladite ville (1564),” _Rev. des Soc. savant des\r\ndépart._, 5^[e] série, III (1872), 781.\r\n\r\n[892] While here, Catherine dispatched the marshal Bourdillon into\r\nGuyenne for the purpose of dissolving the league formed at Cadillac on\r\nMarch 13, 1563 (D’Aubigné, II, 213). As we shall see, the mission was\r\nfruitless.\r\n\r\n[893] _Correspondance de Catherine de Médicis_, II, Introd., lviii. The\r\neditor adds: “De toutes les villes du Midi, c’était [Beziers] celle qui\r\ncomptait le plus de Protestants.” On account of the alarm evinced by\r\nthe Huguenots of the south—300 gentlemen of Beziers visited the King\r\nin a body—Charles IX, when at Marseilles on November 4, “confirmed”\r\nthe Edict of Amboise. Yet so apprehensive was the court that whenever\r\nit stopped an effort was made to disarm the local populace (_C. S. P.\r\nFor._, No. 788-1564).\r\n\r\n[894] On the incident of Catherine reading a MS chronicle about Blanche\r\nof Castile, see the extract of the Venetian ambassador in Baschet (_La\r\ndiplomatie vénetienne_, 521, 522).\r\n\r\n[895] _Correspondance de Catherine de Médicis_, II, Introd., lix.\r\n\r\n[896] Claude Haton, I, 378.\r\n\r\n[897] The order of the King of December 13, 1564, prohibiting any\r\nnobles whoever they might be, unless princes of the house of France,\r\nfrom entering the government of the Ile-de-France is still unpublished.\r\nIt is preserved in a report of the Spanish ambassador, Arch. nat., K.\r\n1,505, No. 31. It is to be distinguished from the general _ordonnance_\r\nof the year before—“Lettres du roy contenans defenses à toutes\r\npersonnes de ne porter harquebuzes, pistoles, ni pistolets, ni autres\r\nbastons à feu, sur peine de confiscation de leurs armes et chevaulx,”\r\nParis, 1564. Cf. Isambert, XIV, 142.\r\n\r\n[898] All the historians notice this episode. See D’Aubigné, Book IV,\r\nchap, v; _Corresp. de Catherine de Médicis_, II, Introd., lix, lx, and\r\n253-56 where the letters of the marshal and the queen mother on the\r\nsubject are given. The editor, in a long note, sifts the evidence.\r\nOther accounts are in Claude Haton, I, 381-83 (other references in\r\nnote); _C. S. P. For._, No. 942, January 24, 1564; _Mém. du duc de\r\nNevers_, V, 12, 13; Castelnau, Book VI, chap. ii.\r\n\r\nIn _Papiers d’état du cardinal de Granvelle_, VIII, 600-2, is an\r\naccount from the pen of Don Louis del Rio, an attaché of the Spanish\r\nembassy at Paris; and on pp. 655, 656 is the “Harangue de l’admiral\r\nde France à MM. de la court du parlement de Paris du 27 janvier 1565\r\navec la réponse.” The baron de Ruble has written the history of this\r\nincident in _Mém. de la Soc. de l’hist. de Paris de l’Ile-de-France_,\r\nVol. VI.\r\n\r\nAccording to a letter of Mary Stuart to Queen Elizabeth, February 12,\r\n1565, the resentment due to the old law-suit over Dammartin flashed\r\nout at this time. But it must have been a conjecture on her part,\r\nfor she adds: “I have heard no word of the duke of Guise or monsieur\r\nd’Aumale.”—_C. S. P. Scot._, II, 146. The prince of Condé’s Catholic\r\nleanings at this critical moment are manifested in a letter to his\r\nsister, the abbess of Chelles, in which he states that he is annoyed\r\nat the outrage committed on the cardinal of Lorraine by the marshal\r\nMontmorency; that the union of these two houses is more than necessary;\r\nthat if he had been with the cardinal, he would have given proof of his\r\ngood-will by deeds. See Appendix VII.\r\n\r\n[899] “Les confraires du Sainct-Esprit et autres reprenoient plus de\r\nviguer, et les provinces ne pouvoient plus souffrir les ministres ny\r\nles presches publics et particulièrs, et se séparoient entièrement des\r\nhuguenots; qui estoient argumens certains qu’en peu de temps il se\r\nverroit quelque grand changement.”—Castelnau, Book VI, chap. ii.\r\n\r\n[900] Ardent Catholics, like Cardinal Granvella, believed both the\r\nmarshal Montmorency and Damville to be Protestants at heart (_Papiers\r\nd’état du cardinal de Granvelle_, VIII, 278).\r\n\r\n[901] “Des catholiques formèrent des ‘unions’ pour défendre l’honneur\r\nde Dieu et de la Sainte Eglise, et ces unions, en se rapprochant\r\nconstituèrent la Ligue.”—Beulier, “Pourquoi la France est-elle restée\r\ncatholique au XVI^[e] siècle,” _Revue anglo-romaine_, January 11, 1896,\r\n257. The Jesuits worked hard in France for Philip II. Forneron, II,\r\n304, quotes an interesting letter to this effect from a Jesuit working\r\nin France.\r\n\r\n[902] The procès-verbal of this league is in _Mémoires de Condé_,\r\ned. London, VI, 290-306.

Nat., L _b._ 33: 172.\r\nIt evidently was circulated as a political pamphlet by the Huguenots.\r\nBut where is the original? Portions of it are as follows: “Mon frère\r\n... j’ay receu de vostre homme la lettre que m’avez escripte.... J’en\r\nay par plusieurs fois cy devant escript à Messieurs de Montpensier,\r\nd’Estampes, Cehavigny: par où ils auroyent bien peu juger la volonté\r\nque j’ay tousjours lue de nous venger, et combien je desirerois\r\nl’association que vous dites (_verso_) prevoyant assez combien elle\r\nestoit necessaire non seulement pour nous, mais aussi pour tous les\r\ngens de bien à qui l’on en veult plus que jamais.\r\n\r\n“Et pour ceste cause, mon frere, je trouverais merveilleusement bon que\r\nles dicts Sieurs y voulsissent entendre, laissant les villes, d’autant\r\nqu’il n’y a nulle asseurance en peuple, comme je l’ay dernièrement\r\nencore cogneut. Mais avec la Noblesse, de ma part je suis tout resolu\r\net prest, et n’y veux espargner aucune chose, et le plustost sera le\r\nmeilleur. Qui me fait vous prier, de regarder et en bien adviser tous\r\nparensemble, et mesmes avec le seigneur de Montpensier, et de m’en\r\nmander ce que vous aurez deliberé, à fin que par là je resolue avec les\r\nSeigneurs et Noblesse qui sont de deça et mes Gouverneurs, qui feront\r\ntout ce que je vouldray.\r\n\r\n“Au demeurant, vous avez bien entendu le nombre de Chevaliers de\r\nl’Ordre qui ont esté faicts, qui sont bien pres de trente ou plus,\r\ndont monsieur de Brion en est des premiers. Aussi des preparatifs que\r\nlon fuit à la Court pour aller à Bayonne recevoir festoyer la Roine\r\nd’Espaigne.”\r\n\r\n[907] _Commentaires et lettres de Montluc_, III, 80-86. I have used the\r\nseventeenth-century translation of Cotton, 274, 275, which preserves\r\nsomething of the spirit of the original. De Thou, never having seen\r\nthe document in question, expresses his doubt of Montluc’s veracity in\r\nthe matter, and argues the improbability of the King’s having followed\r\nMontluc’s advice on the ground that the crown had condemned all secret\r\nassociations as destructive of domestic tranquillity. “Why should\r\nthe King make a league with his subjects?” asks De Thou. “Far from\r\nderiving any advantage from it, would it not diminish his authority?\r\nWould the King not incite his subjects to do exactly what he wanted\r\nto avoid, and by his own example accustom them to town factions; to\r\nfoment and support parties in the kingdom?”—De Thou, IV, Book XXXVII,\r\n33. Unfortunately for the truth of De Thou’s hypothesis, the facts are\r\nthe other way, for there is documentary proof that Charles IX followed\r\nout Montluc’s suggestion, and sent the declaration to all his officers\r\nrequesting their adherence to it. The baron de Ruble discovered the\r\nproof in F. Fr. 20,461, fol. 58. See his edition of Montluc, III, 86,\r\nnote; cf. D’Aubigné, II, 218, and n. 6.\r\n\r\n[908] The credit of having made this important discovery is due to the\r\nbaron de Ruble, _Commentaires et lettres de Montluc_, IV, 317-26, 329,\r\n330, 346, 347, 362, 363. But it was Forneron who showed the world the\r\nmagnitude of Montluc’s treason (_Hist. de Philippe II_, I, 293-330).\r\nSuspicion of Montluc’s course, however, prevailed in his own day. He\r\nwas charged with having agreed to deliver over the province of Guyenne\r\nto Philip II in 1570 and issued a cartel against his adversaries\r\ndenying that he had any intelligence with Spain. See Appendix VIII.\r\n\r\n[909] D’Andelot’s appointment to this post created intense feeling\r\namong the Catholic officers. Strozzi, Brissac, and Charry openly\r\nrefused to obey him (D’Aubigné, II, 207; Brantôme, V, 341).\r\n\r\n[910] Forneron, I, 294, n. 3.\r\n\r\n[911] Montluc, ed. De Ruble, IV, Introd., ix.\r\n\r\n[912] It will be observed that Montluc independently had come to the\r\nsame conclusion as Granvella.\r\n\r\n[913] Montluc, ed. De Ruble, IV, 317-26, February 8, 1564.\r\n\r\n[914] Forneron, I, 330. D’Aubigné, II, 294, wrongly ascribes this plot\r\nto the Jesuits. The traditional Protestant account, attributed to\r\nCalignon, chancellor of Navarre, is printed in _Mém. du duc de Nevers_,\r\nII, 579; also in _Mém. de Villeroy_. The account in _Arch. cur._, VI,\r\n281, is much colored. Catholic historians have denied the existence\r\nof such a plot, e. g., the abbé Garnier in _Mém. de l’Acad. des\r\ninscrip._ (1787), Vol. L, 722. But since the publication of Montluc’s\r\n_Correspondance_ there is no doubt of it.\r\n\r\n[915] Forneron, I, 303-6. Cabie, _L’Ambassade de St. Sulpice_, 483,\r\ngives the text of the ambassador’s letter to Catherine, and his note of\r\nthanks to the queen’s embroiderer who divulged the plot.\r\n\r\n[916] D’Aubigné, II, 204, 205; _Mém. de Condé_, IV, 669. Charles IX’s\r\nletter of November 30, 1563, to St. Sulpice gives some details of the\r\nprocess (_L’Ambassade de St. Sulpice_, 186, 187).\r\n\r\n[917] _Correspondance de Catherine de Médicis_, II, 119, 120. Her\r\nletter to her daughter in Spain, not in the correspondence, which\r\nM. Cabie cites in _L’Ambassade de St. Sulpice_, 208, displays real\r\ncourage. Charles IX said he could not abandon Jeanne d’Albret “sans\r\nêtre vu déserter de ses plus proches parents” (_ibid._, 247). The\r\ninstructions to Lansac, who was sent to Spain to protest in the name of\r\nFrance against the papal action, show fine scorn (_ibid._, 224).\r\n\r\n[918] _Commentaires et lettres de Montluc_, IV, 327, note.\r\n\r\n[919] _L’Ambassade de St. Sulpice_, 228: “Réponse de Philippe II au sr.\r\nde Lansac en sa première audience, 18 fev. 1565.”\r\n\r\n[920] _Ibid._, 247.\r\n\r\n[921] _L’Ambassade de St. Sulpice_, 5.\r\n\r\n[922] Letter to St. Sulpice, February 10, 1563, _ibid._, 115.\r\n\r\n[923] _Ibid._, 135.\r\n\r\n[924] Pius IV was so perplexed that he tried to avoid pronouncing in\r\nthe matter. “On avait décidé, à la dernière fête de St. Pierre, de\r\nsupprimer cette cérémonie, afin de n’offenser personne.”—Charles IX to\r\nSt. Sulpice, July 24, 1563, _ibid._, 141.\r\n\r\n[925] Du Ferrier, French ambassador at Venice to St. Sulpice, April 12,\r\n1564, _ibid._, 252.\r\n\r\n[926] Cf. the report of the conversation between Archbishop Cispontin,\r\nthe papal secretary, and D’Oysel (_ibid._, 273, July, 1564).\r\n\r\n[927] “Instructions données par Charles IX à L’Aubespine le jeune,\r\nenvoyé en Espagne,” _ibid._, 277, June 24, 1564.\r\n\r\n[928] _Ibid._, 279, 281, 282, 299. “It is an error to regard, as most\r\nhistorians do, the course of the relations of Philip II to the see of\r\nRome as a single consistent development, for the earlier part of his\r\nreign was dominated by a principle utterly different from that which\r\ninspired the latter. In the sixties and early seventies the Spanish\r\nking devoted himself primarily to the maintenance of the principles\r\nof the counter-Reformation; he abandoned political advantage in the\r\ninterest of the faith, united with the ancient foes of his house for\r\nthe suppression of heresy, dedicated himself and his people to the\r\ncause of Catholicism.... But in the later seventies there came a\r\nchange. The spirit of the counter-Reformation was waning in France:\r\nthe old political lines of cleavage had begun to reappear; Philip\r\nbegan to discover that he was draining his land to the dregs in the\r\ninterests of a foreign power who offered him no reciprocal advantages,\r\nand reluctantly exchanged his earlier attitude of abject devotion to\r\nthe interests of the church for the more patriotic one of solicitude\r\nfor the welfare of Spain.... Viewed from the Spanish standpoint, the\r\nstory of this long development is a tragic but familiar one—reckless\r\nnational sacrifice for the sake of an antiquated ideal, exhaustion\r\nin the interests of a foreign power, which uses and casts aside but\r\nnever reciprocates. But it adds one more to the already long list\r\nof favorable revisions of the older and more hostile verdicts on\r\nthe Spanish monarch. Philip’s attitude toward the papacy, though\r\nnot always wise or statesmanlike, was at least far more honorable\r\nand loyal to the church than it is usually represented (as, for\r\ninstance, by Philippson): the first part of his reign is marked by his\r\nsingle-hearted devotion to the cause of Rome, and even at the last\r\nthat devotion does not falter, though the interests of his country\r\nforced him to adopt a more national policy toward the papacy than that\r\nwith which he had begun.”—R.

Q. H._, XXXIV, 485. Montluc put a memoir in Alva’s hands\r\nwhich proposed an alliance between the crowns of France and Spain for\r\nthe purpose of crushing the Protestants in France. In event of the\r\nFrench king’s refusal to become a party to this alliance, Montluc\r\noutlined the means of defense which Philip II would have to resort\r\nto. This memoir is published by the baron de Ruble in _Commentaires\r\net lettres de Montluc_, V, 23 ff. In this striking document the\r\nveteran soldier, after setting forth his favorite thesis that French\r\nCalvinism was antimonarchical in its nature, makes a survey of the\r\nreligious state of the provinces. He concludes that while Protestantism\r\nwas rampant everywhere in France, in five-sixths of the country the\r\nCatholics were superior. The place of great danger is Guyenne. The\r\nmutual safety of France and Spain requires the subjugation of this\r\nprovince. France cannot or will not do this alone (cf. _Correspondance\r\nde Catherine de Médicis_, I, 342, n. 3; 343, n. 4). It remains,\r\ntherefore, for the king of Spain to do so. This is the historical\r\nargument for all of Montluc’s subsequent course of treason with Philip\r\nII.\r\n\r\n[971] This has been triumphantly proved by Count Hector de la Ferrière,\r\nwho has shown that M. Combes, _L’Entrevue de Bayonne de 1565 et la\r\nquestion de St. Barthélemy d’après les archives de Simancas_, Paris,\r\n1881, has mistranslated the very documents upon which he relied (_R. Q.\r\nH._, _XXXIV_, 511 ff.).\r\n\r\n[972] Pius V was elected pope January 17, 1566 (see Hilliger, _Die\r\nWahl Pius V zum Päpste_, 1907). He had been grand inquisitor before\r\nhis elevation, and imparted a ferocious zeal to the holy office\r\n(see Bertelotti, _Martiri di Libero Pensero e Vittime della Sta.\r\nInquisizione nei Secoli, XVI, XVII, e XVIII_, Rome, 1892). The violence\r\nof his character and his bigotry led to his committing several acts\r\ninjurious to the Catholic cause, but it was due to him that the\r\nSpanish, Venetian, and papal fleets defeated the Turks at Lepanto.\r\nHe wrote on March 28, 1569 to Catherine de Medici: “Si Votre Majesté\r\ncontinue, comme elle a fait constamment, dans la rectitude de son âme?\r\net dans la simplicité de son cœur, à ne chercher que l’honneur de Dieu\r\ntoutpuissent, et à combattre ouvertement et ardemment les ennemis de\r\nla religion catholique, _jusqu’à ce qu’ils soient tous massacrés_ (ad\r\ninternecionem usque), qu’elle soit assurée que le secours divin ne lui\r\nmanquera jamais, et que Dieu lui préparera, ainsi qu’au roi, son fils,\r\nde plus grandes victoires: ce n’est que par _l’extermination entière_\r\ndes hérétiques (deletis omnibus haeritics) que le roi pourra rendre à\r\nce noble royaume l’ancien culte de la religion catholique.”—Potter,\r\n_Pie V_, 35; letter of the Pope to Catherine de Medici, March 28, 1569.\r\nThe original Latin version of this letter, the salient words of which\r\nare in parentheses above, is in _Epistola SS. Pii V_, ed. Gouban,\r\nIII, 154, Antwerp, 1640. The editor was secretary to the marquis de\r\nCastel-Rodrigio, ambassador of Philip IV to the Holy See. An abridged\r\nedition was published by Potter, _Lettres de St. Pie V sur les affaires\r\nreligieuses de son temps en France_, Paris, 1826. The letter is one\r\nof congratulation written to Catherine de Medici upon the Catholic\r\nvictory of Jarnac and the death of the prince of Condé. (Cf. the letter\r\nof April 13, 1569, on p. 156 to the same effect.) Nevertheless, even\r\nthe Pope regarded the total destruction of the French Protestants\r\nas a result more devoutly to be wished for than practicable. Pope\r\nPius V, however, was not the first advocate of destruction, for as\r\nearly as 1556 François Lepicart gave the same advice to Henry II: “Le\r\nroy devroit pour un temps contrefaire le luthérien parmi eux [the\r\nProtestants], afin que, prenant de là occasion de s’assembler hautement\r\npartout, on pût faire main-basse sur eux tous, et en purger une bonne\r\nfois le royaume.”—_Bayle’s Dictionary_, art. “Rose.”\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of assassination for heresy originally proceeded from\r\nthe mediaeval church, in which it can be traced back as far as the\r\nbeginning of the Crusades. Urban II asserted that it was not murder\r\nto kill an excommunicated person, provided it was done from religious\r\nzeal. (“Non enim eos homicidas arbitramur quod adversus excommunicatos\r\nzelo catholicae matris ardentes, eorum quoslibet trucidasse\r\ncontigerit.”—Migne, _Epistolae Urbani_, CLI, No. 122; Mansi, XX, 713;\r\nthe same words are used by Ivo of Chartres, X, 331, and by Gratian\r\nin the _Decretum_ [causa 32, quaestio 2, canon: _De neptis_].) The\r\npassage stands in the revised edition, to which Gregory XIII prefixed\r\nthe injunction that nothing should be omitted, and the gloss gives\r\nthe following paraphrase: “Non putamus eos esse homicidas qui zelo\r\njustitiae eos occiderunt.”\r\n\r\nIn 1208 Innocent III proscribed the count of Toulouse (Teulet, _Trésor\r\ndes Chartes_, I, 316), and in the same pontificate the Fourth Lateran\r\nCouncil declared that the Pope might depose anyone who neglected\r\nthe duty of exterminating heresy and might bestow his state on\r\nothers (Harduin, _Concilia_, VII, 19). The same canon reappears in\r\nthe _Decreta_ of Gregory IX (Lib. iv, tit. 7. cap. 13). St. Thomas\r\nAquinas declared that the loss of political rights was incurred by\r\nexcommunication (_Summa_ [ed. 1853], III, 51). The teaching that\r\nfaith need not be kept with a heretic was well established by the\r\nchurch in the thirteenth century. It was pleaded by the Emperor in\r\nthe case of Huss—“quoniam non est frangere fidem ei qui Deo fidem\r\nfrangit.”—Palacky, _Documenta Joannis Hussi_, I, 540.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of this teaching survived in the sixteenth century. In\r\n1561 some citizens of Lucca, having embraced the Protestant belief,\r\nwere obliged to flee from the city. The government of the republic,\r\nunder suggestion from Rome, passed a law on January 9, 1562, that\r\nwhoever killed one of these refugees, though he had been outlawed,\r\nyet would his outlawry be reversed; and that if he himself needed\r\nnot this privilege, it could be transferred to another (_Archivio\r\nstorico italiano_, X, app. 176, 177). On January 20, Pope Pius IV\r\nwrote to congratulate the city on this pious legislation: “Legimus\r\npia laudabiliaque decretaque civitatis istius Generale Consilium\r\nnuper fecit ad civitatem ipsam ab omni heresum labe integram\r\nconservandam.... Nec vero quicquam fieri potuisse judicamus, vel ad\r\ntuendum Dei honorem sanctius, vel ad conservandam vestre patrie salutem\r\nprudentius.”—_Ibid._, 178, 179.\r\n\r\nWhen Henry of Valois made oath to respect liberty of conscience in\r\nPoland he was informed that it would be sin to observe the oath, but\r\nthat if he broke it, the sin of making it would be regarded as a venial\r\noffense: “Minor fuit offensio, ubi mens ea praestandi quae pelebatur,\r\ndefuit.”—Hosii, _Opera_, II, 367.\r\n\r\nThe Ridolfi plot, it may be added, casts a very clear light upon the\r\nteaching and conduct of Pius V.\r\n\r\n[I owe some of the information given above to a curious accident. In\r\n1899, among a number of books which I purchased in London, I found\r\na number of fragmentary notes dealing with this question. There is\r\nnothing to indicate their authorship, but in recognition of the\r\nassistance of some scholar to me unknown this acknowledgment is made.\r\nIt may be added that the books purchased dealt with France in the\r\nfourteenth century].\r\n\r\n[973] This was Montluc’s idea, which he broached both to the cardinal\r\nof Lorraine and Philip II, in the form of an edict which he himself\r\nimprovised, and which we know that the king of Spain actually read\r\n(_Commentaires et lettres de Montluc_, IV, 359-62). There are two\r\nSpanish translations of the first document in the Archives nationales.\r\nPhilip indorsed the letter to Bardaxi in his own handwriting: “la carta\r\npara el cardinal de Lorena.”—_Ibid._, IV, 362, note.\r\n\r\n[974] _Papiers d’état du cardinal de Granvelle_, IX, 306; Gachard,\r\n_Correspondance de Philippe II sur les Pays-Bas_, I, 368; letter of\r\nMargaret of Parma to Antonio Perez, September 27, 1565.\r\n\r\n[975] The monotony of life and the tyranny of Spanish etiquette must\r\nhave borne hard upon the little queen of Spain. But in the midst of the\r\nmiseries of this “royal slavery,” as M. le comte de la Ferrière calls\r\nit, it was a crowning humiliation to be condemned to be the instrument\r\nof Philip’s political intrigues. That her young spirit rebelled, though\r\nhopelessly, against the situationis evident, from a pitiful letter\r\nwritten by her to her brother’s ambassador in Spain (La Ferrière,\r\n_Rapport_, 28).\r\n\r\n[976] On Cardinal Pacheco see Poulet, I, 7, note and Index.\r\n\r\n[977] _Correspondance de Catherine de Médicis_, II, Introd., lxxxiii,\r\nlxxxiv.\r\n\r\n[978] The key to it was discovered in 1885. Suriano had been Venetian\r\nenvoy at Trent. He was not the regular ambassador of the senate in\r\nFrance and his dispatches seem to have been in another key from that of\r\nMarc Antonio Barbaro the accredited ambassador.\r\n\r\n[979] _Correspondance de Catherine de Médicis_, II, Introd., lxxxv.\r\n\r\n[980] Combes, 47.\r\n\r\n[981] “For a whole fortnight Catherine resisted the pressure of her\r\ndaughter and the Spanish envoys, who found support in the drastic\r\nproposals of the leaders of the French Catholics. Within the last\r\nthree days of the interview, however, concessions were made which\r\nsatisfied Alva and his master, though Granvella and Alva exhibited\r\nsome skepticism. The queen was prompted, ... not by Alva’s alleged\r\nthreat that the King must lose his crown, or his brother Henry his\r\nhead, but merely by her fear that the total failure of the interview\r\nwould hinder the attainment of her ends. These concessions consisted\r\nin the engagement to accept the decrees of the Council of Trent and in\r\nan enigmatical promise of punishment or remedial measures. The latter,\r\nhowever, probably did not refer to the judicial murder or assassination\r\nof the Huguenot leaders—a scheme suggested by Montpensier’s confessor\r\nand welcomed by Alva—but to the expulsion of the ministers and\r\nsubsequent enforcement of orthodoxy. The execution of these measures\r\nwas postponed until the conclusion of the journey, but it seems\r\nprobable that Catherine never seriously intended an act which would\r\nhave been the inevitable sign of civil war.”—Armstrong in _English\r\nHistorical Review_, VI, 578, 579 (review of Marcks, _Die Zusammenkunft\r\nvon Bayonne_, Strasburg, 1889).\r\n\r\n[982] For example La Noue, chap. xii (1567).\r\n\r\n[983] _Correspondance de Catherine de Médicis_, II, 509, 510; _R.

This statement, even if there were no\r\nother evidence, is confirmed for the south of France by the court’s\r\nexperience in the foothills of the Pyrenees in January, 1565 (cf.\r\n_Hist. du Languedoc_, V, 465). For the west of France see _Chroniques\r\nFontenaisiennes_ (Paris, 1841), 84, 85, and the “Journal de Louvet,”\r\npublished in the _Revue d’Anjou_ in 1854. One quotation may suffice:\r\n“Au mois de febvrier, il tomba sy grande quantité de neige au païs\r\nd’Anjou et fust l’hyver si froid, que les rivières furent glacées et\r\nqu’on marchoit et passont par-dessus, et que tous les lauriers et\r\nromarins gelèrent, et qu’au dégel les eaux crurent et furent si grandes\r\nqu’elles rompirent des arches, ponts et chaussées, et fust ceste année\r\nappelée l’année du grand hyver.” I know of no article upon this subject\r\nas a whole. M. Joubert, _Etude sur les misères de l’Anjou aux XV^[e] et\r\nXVI^[e] siècles_, 1886, pp. 35 and 161, has a little to say. The subject\r\ndeserves treatment. The sources of course are almost wholly local.\r\n\r\n[993] Claude Haton, I, 331.\r\n\r\n[994] _Idem_, I, 409.\r\n\r\n[995] Catherine’s order to the marshal Montmorency, as governor of\r\nParis, dated November 19, 1565, is in _Correspondance de Catherine de\r\nMédicis_, II, 325.\r\n\r\n[996] The authorities of Provins made requisition of the grain\r\npossessed by private persons and appropriated all save that which\r\nwas necessary for the owners, which was sold to the townspeople\r\nat the maximum price of 20 sous per _boisseau_. The abbot of St.\r\nJacques and the prior of St. Ayoul baked bread to be distributed to\r\nthe poor. One of the wealthy citizens from Easter till harvest made\r\ndaily distribution of bread to more than three hundred poor, besides\r\nfurnishing them with work (Claude Haton, I, 409).\r\n\r\nThe _boisseau_ (Med. Latin, _boissellus_ [Du Cange, _s. v._]) was an\r\nancient measure of capacity equivalent to 13.01 litres, approximately\r\n12 quarts. In remote parts of France the term is still sometimes used\r\nto indicate a décalitre. The _boisseau_ was used for both dry and\r\nliquid measure. On the other hand the _bichet_ (Med. Latin, _bisselus_\r\nand _busellus_, whence the English bushel) was a dry measure,\r\nrepresenting from one-fifth to two-fifths of a hectolitre (from 4.4\r\nto 8.8 gallons) according to the province. The _setier_, was a larger\r\ndry measure of 6 pecks (Paris measure). The _muid_ (Latin _modius_)\r\nalso was of variable capacity. That of Paris equaled 36 gallons. The\r\n_queue du creu_ was a large wooden cask, about equivalent to a hogshead\r\nand a half, and was used only for wine. The calculations of terms of\r\nAmerican money are on the theory that the _livre tournois_ in 1565 was\r\nequivalent to 3.11 francs, according to the estimate of the vicomte\r\nd’Avenel in _Revue des deux mondes_, June 15, 1892, p. 795.\r\n\r\n[997] Claude Haton, I, 418.

Before the end of the\r\nmonth the old scores were officially “shelved” by decrees of the King\r\nin council (January 29 and 31, 1566). Many of the sources allude to\r\nthis hypocritical reconciliation: De Thou, V, Book XXIX, 184; Poulet I,\r\n125—letter of Granvella from Rome; D’Aubigné, II, 223-25; _C. S.

It was begun on May 17, 1565.\r\n\r\nMingled with this fear was apprehension lest even the Turk might\r\nbecome an ally of the Flemings and the Protestant French (Poulet, I,\r\n357, Morillon to Granvelle). That it was not an utterly fantastic\r\nnotion of him alone, see the letter of Margaret of Parma to Philip II,\r\nin _Corresp. de Philippe II_, I, No. 411, and Gachard, _Corresp. de\r\nGuillaume le Taciturne_, VI, 408.\r\n\r\n[1025] _Archives de la maison d’Orange-Nassau_, I, 259-89; Poulet,\r\nI, 207; Gachard, _La Bibliothèque Nationale à Paris_, I, 88. “Avec\r\nla liberté des consciences, que aulcungs prétendent, nous ne nous\r\ntrouverions pas mal si, suyvant l’exemple des François, nous tumbions\r\naux mesmes inconvenientz.”—Letter of Granvella, April 9, 1566, in\r\nPoulet, I, 209.\r\n\r\n[1026] Sir Francis Berty to Cecil: “The Prince of Orange since\r\nWednesday shows himself openly to take the Gueux part, and divers of\r\nhis men wear their badge.

He had already\r\nbeen at least nine months in the pay of Spain. He got 20 écus per diem\r\nfor one job (_Papiers d’état du cardinal de Granvelle_, IX, 404, 595).\r\nMontigny came to Paris ostensibly to attend the wedding of the duke\r\nof Nemours’ son to the admiral’s niece at Easter time. We get a line\r\non Philip II’s methods at this point, for the Guises themselves were\r\nhaving secret and treasonable dealings with Spain, yet did not know\r\nof Montigny’s relation to Philip II and treated him with scorn and\r\ncontempt (_ibid._; Poulet, I, 329; cf. Finot, _L’espionnage militaire\r\ndans les Pays-Bas entre la France et l’Espagne aux XVI^[e] et XVII^[e]\r\nsiècles_).\r\n\r\n[1029] Poulet, I, 304; Edward Cook to Cecil: “Montgomery has told\r\nhim that the French Protestants are resolved to succour those of\r\nFlanders.”—_C. S. P. For._, No. 661, August 18, 1566. This letter\r\nis analyzed in the _Bull. de la comm. roy. d’histoire_, 3^[e] sér., I,\r\n129. Granvella’s confidant in Brussels, the prevost Morillon, wrote\r\nwith truth on July 7: “Je croy que si avons mal cest année ce ne sera\r\ndu costel de France.”—Poulet, I, 350. Cf. Reiffenberg, _Corresp. de\r\nMarguerite de Parme_, 88; Gachard, _Corresp. de Philippe II_, I, 429,\r\n431, 436; at p. 473 is a letter dated October 15 in Italian from the\r\nduchess of Parma to Philip expressing fear of Huguenot projects.\r\n\r\n[1030] Louis of Nassau without doubt was in close connection\r\nwith the leading French Protestants. See _Archives de la maison\r\nd’Orange-Nassau_, I, 229; II, 196, 403. It was extremely difficult to\r\nrepress the ardor of the Protestants at Valenciennes, owing to its\r\nnearness of the French border and the number of Calvinist preachers\r\nwhom the Huguenots sent into the country in June, 1566 (_ibid._, II,\r\n135). For the influx of Calvinist preachers into the country as early\r\nas 1561 see Languet, _Epist. secr._, II, 155. The prince of Condé was\r\nreputed to have sold a tapestry for 9,000 florins, which he gave to the\r\ncause there (Poulet, I, 439).\r\n\r\n[1031] Montluc to Bardaxi, October 27, 1564: _Commentaires et lettres\r\nde Montluc_, IV, 368.\r\n\r\n[1032] Poulet, I, 64; Reiffenberg, 91; _Archives de la maison\r\nd’Orange-Nassau_, II, 175, 178.\r\n\r\n[1033] _Corresp. de Philippe II_, I, 433.\r\n\r\n[1034] The government of Charles IX even winked at the secret levies\r\nmade by the prince of Condé for the benefit of Louis of Nassau, from\r\nbehind the mask of an official repudiation of the complicity of any\r\nFrench in Flanders, denying that the prince of Condé was ever in\r\nAntwerp in disguise (Poulet, I, 521, 3; Gachard, _La Bibliothèque\r\nNationale à Paris_, II, 206). The last assertion, of course, was\r\ntrue. On July 24 a royal proclamation was issued at Alva’s instance,\r\nforbidding French subjects to go into the Low Countries “pour\r\nnégotiation ou autrement.”—Poulet, I, 364; Gachard, _op. cit._, II, 27.\r\n\r\n[1035] “Hinc illae lachrymae et ille metus,” wrote the provost to\r\nGranvella (Poulet, I, 405). It was the wish of the Emperor that the\r\nKing of Spain would go in person and without an army to the Low\r\nCountries in order to pacify it by kindness and not by force (_Archives\r\nde la maison d’Orange-Nassau_, II, 505; Raumer, I, 173, December,\r\n1566). But Philip II could not make up his mind to come in person\r\nto the Netherlands, although advised to do so by all. For years he\r\ncontinued to entertain the thought and continually put it off. See a\r\nletter of the Duchess of Parma to Duke Henry of Brunswick upon the\r\ncoming of the duke of Alva, January 1567, in _Archives de la maison\r\nd’Orange-Nassau_, III, 21 ff.\r\n\r\n[1036] On April 3, 1565, St. Sulpice sent word to Charles IX that\r\nPhilip II had sent Menendez to Florida “avec une bonne flotte et\r\n600 hommes pour combattre _les Français et les passer au fil de\r\nl’épée_.”—_L’Ambassade de St. Sulpice_, 364. When Fourquevaux\r\nsucceeded him the French government had not yet learned of the\r\nmassacre. St. Sulpice’s fragmentary information is to be found at pp.\r\n400, 401, 404, 414. The abortive efforts of France to secure redress\r\nare spread at length in _Corresp. de Catherine de Médicis_, II, 209,\r\n330, 337, 338, 341, 342, 360; and in Fourquevaux, I, Nos. 4-7, 9, 15,\r\n21, 28, 43, 47, 55, 66. The editor’s account in the Introd., xv-xxi\r\nis admirable. In the _Correspondencia española_, II, 126-28, is to be\r\nfound Philip II’s letter to Chantonnay, February 28, 1566, in reply to\r\nthe ambassador’s letter of advice about Coligny’s enterprise. The blood\r\nof French colonists who had been massacred in Florida cried out for\r\nvengeance, and from the hour of its knowledge the subject of reprisal\r\nwas a matter of common talk in the Norman ports (_C.S.P. Dom._, Add.,\r\nXIII, 227). On September 24, 1566, Sir Amyas Paulet, the English\r\nambassador informed his government that he had information that a\r\nsquadron was about to sail for this purpose, although it was “late for\r\nso long a voyage” (_ibid._, 31). On the whole history of this ill-fated\r\ncolony see Gaillard, “La reprise de la Floride faite par le capit.\r\nGourgues (1568),” _Notices et extr. des manuscr. de la Biblioth.

On Bolwiller see\r\n_Papiers d’état du cardinal de Granvelle_, IX, 36, note.

His mother\r\nwas a Fürstenburg. (See _ibid._, IX, 24, note.) Strange vicissitude,\r\nthat a descendant of that house in the next century should have been\r\nLouis XIV’s right-hand agent in his seizures on the Rhine through the\r\nChambers of Réunion, playing an identically opposite part from that of\r\nhis ancestors.\r\n\r\n[1043] _Papiers d’état du cardinal de Granvelle_, IX, 71—Bolwiller to\r\nthe cardinal March 20, 1565.\r\n\r\nMetz was early famous for its interest in the Reformation. The laxness\r\nof the episcopal discipline in the first part of the sixteenth century\r\ncontributed to the growth of this spirit, and finally led to a Catholic\r\nreaction. The city was more inclined, however, to Calvinism than to\r\nLutheranism. Charles V prohibited the exercise of the Lutheran faith,\r\nbut nevertheless, the Protestants of Metz made an alliance with the\r\nSmalkald League. Under the French domination the city passed definitely\r\nfrom Lutheranism to Calvinism. The French governor, Vieilleville,\r\nwas a moderate in policy and granted the Huguenots a church in the\r\ninterior of the town. During the first civil war the Protestants in\r\nMetz remained tranquil, but soon afterward Farel visited the city\r\nfor the third time, and thereafter the city’s religious activity was\r\nconsiderable. The cardinal of Lorraine suppressed Protestant preaching\r\nin the diocese and closed the church. When Charles IX visited Metz in\r\n1564 the edifice was destroyed and Protestant worship was forbidden.\r\nAfter the death of the Marshal Vieilleville, the count de Retz was made\r\ngovernor. One of the motives of the support of the Huguenot cause by\r\nJohn Casimir, the prince palatine, was a promise made by the Huguenots\r\nthat he would be given the governorship of Metz. On the subject as\r\na whole see Thirion, _Etude sur l’histoire du protestantisme à Metz\r\net dans le pays Messin_, Nancy, 1885; Le Coullon, _Journal (1537-87)\r\nd’après le manuscrit original_, publié pour la première fois et annoté\r\npar E. de Bouteiller, Paris, Dumoulin, 1881.\r\n\r\n[1044] _Papiers d’état du cardinal de Granvelle_, IX, 462, 463.\r\n\r\n[1045] Granvella to Perez, October 15, 1565; _ibid._, IX, 594, 595.\r\n\r\n[1046] See Philip II’s letter to Chantonnay, October 22, 1565; _ibid._,\r\nIX 609 ff.\r\n\r\n[1047] He had served in Italy in 1555 and became the cardinal’s bailiff\r\nand revenue-collector in the bishopric of Metz after the treaty of\r\nCateau-Cambrésis (_Commentaire et lettres de Montluc_, I, 228).\r\n\r\n[1048] For an account of the “Cardinal’s War” see De Thou, V, Book\r\nXXXVII, 37-40. There is another account in the _Mém. de Condé_, V, 27,\r\nsupposed to have been written by Salzedo himself. In F. Fr. 3, 197,\r\nfolio 92, there is an unpublished letter of Salzedo’s (see Appendix\r\nIX), and another of the duke of Aumale upon this incident. Chantonnay\r\ncomforted Philip for the disappointment over Metz by telling him, that\r\nwhile the restoration of the Three Bishoprics was indeed important,\r\nbecause of their bearing upon the situation in Flanders, the trouble\r\nhad averted a marriage alliance between France and Austria which would\r\nhave been more calamitous (Letter to Philip II, October 30, 1565, in\r\n_Papiers d’état du cardinal de Granvelle_, IX, 625).\r\n\r\nTwo years later we find the tricky cardinal of Lorraine still\r\nprotesting his innocence to Catherine and praying her not to be\r\nsuspicious of him (Letter of December 6, 1567, Fillon Collection, No.\r\n316).\r\n\r\n[1049] Forneron, I, 346, on the basis of Alva’s letter to Philip on May\r\n19, 1566, and the cardinal’s own letter, written at the same time (both\r\npreserved in K. 1,505, No. 99, and K. 1,509), assumes that the secret\r\nintercourse between Philip II and the Guises began in the year 1566\r\nand ascribes the immediate occasion of it to the troubles in the Low\r\nCountries. He missed the inception of it by a year. Granvella’s letter\r\nconclusively shows that it began in July, 1565. Every word of this\r\nletter is of weight. It is to be found in _Papiers d’état du cardinal\r\nde Granvelle_, IX, 399-402.\r\n\r\n[1050] Johnson, _Europe in the Sixteenth Century_, 328.

The disastrous news reached\r\nthe King on September 5. For ten days he was ill with a high fever\r\nin consequence. Fourquevaux, writing from Segovia on September 11,\r\nto Charles IX, gives some details of Philip’s illness and how he was\r\ntreated by the physicians and then adds: “Les Espagnols sont bien\r\nmarriez d’entendre que les Lutheriens dud. pais (Flanders) ont commencé\r\ns’empoigner aux eglises et reliques, et à fere marier les prebtres et\r\nnonnains, avec infiniz autres maulx qu’ilz font, qui est le semblable\r\ncommencement des doleurs qui advindrent en votre Royaume du temps des\r\ntroubles.”—_Dépêches de M. Fourquevaux_, I, 124, 125.\r\n\r\n[1052] The Austrian lands were invaded by the Turks in the autumn of\r\n1566 (_Négociations dans le Levant_, II, 721; Languet, _Epist. secr._,\r\nI, 15).\r\n\r\n[1053] It was a pose of Philip’s that the expedition was purely\r\npolitical; cf. Gachard, _Les bibliothèques de Madrid et de l’Escurial_,\r\n94 ff., based on the correspondence of the archbishop of Rossano.\r\n\r\n[1054] Dispatch to Charles IX, December 9, 1566 (Fourquevaux, I,\r\n147-52). He waited in great anxiety for instructions from Paris, daily\r\ngrowing more suspicious because the Spanish King said not a word to\r\nhim on the subject, although he sent for him in audience on January\r\n14, 1567 (_ibid._, 167-72; dispatches of Jan. 5 and 18, 1567). The\r\ntremendous financial operations of the Spanish government (consult\r\nGachard, _Don Carlos et Philippe II_, II, 369, 370) filled him with\r\nalarm, and he made an unsuccessful effort to bribe the secretary of one\r\nof Philip II’s ministers. He gathered that the Spanish forces would\r\nlikely sail for Barcelona and disembark at Nice or Genoa (_ibid._, 176,\r\n177, February 13, 1567).\r\n\r\n[1055] Forneron, I, 347, on authority of Alva’s dispatch in K. 1,507,\r\nNo. 2; cf. _Nég. Tosc._, III, 527.\r\n\r\n[1056] Gachard, _La Bibliothèque Nationale à Paris_, II, 228. The\r\ndispatch was delayed on account of the illness of the courier and\r\nthe heavy snows he encountered in the Pyrenees, and did not reach\r\nthe ambassador until January 15, 1567 (Fourquevaux, I, 168). The\r\ncorrespondence of Bernardo d’Aspremont, viscount of Orthez, governor\r\nof Bayonne—unfortunately much scattered in the volumes of the\r\nBibliothèque Nationale—shows the standing danger the southern\r\nprovinces of France were in from Spanish invasion (_Commentaires et\r\nlettres de Montluc_, III, 400, note).\r\n\r\n[1057] Poulet, II, 183.\r\n\r\n[1058] D’Aubigné, II, 229, note.\r\n\r\n[1059] Poulet, II, 495.\r\n\r\n[1060] D’Aubigné, II, 228; Zurlauben, _Hist. milit. des Suisses_, IV,\r\n335.\r\n\r\n[1061] We learn this from a letter of George Paulet. See Appendix X.\r\n\r\n[1062] Poulet, II, 183; _Dépêches de M. Fourquevaux_, I, 173.\r\n\r\n[1063] _Dépêches de M. Fourquevaux_, I, 174, February 4, 1567. Philip\r\nII took these military preparations of the French with remarkable\r\nequanimity—even Charles IX’s positive refusal to allow the Spanish\r\narmy to traverse France (March 24, 1567). He seemed to be sincerely\r\nanxious to avoid friction with France (see his letter to Granvella,\r\nFebruary 17, 1567, in Poulet, II, 255, 256). The danger in the\r\nLow Countries was too great to allow any outside controversy. The\r\nclandestine operation of Protestant preachers in Spain itself and the\r\nsmuggling of heretical books into the land, concealed in casks of wine,\r\ndisquieted him more than France did at this season. (For information on\r\nthis head see Poulet, II, 126, 142, 199; _Nég. Tosc._, III, 506; Weiss,\r\n_Spanish Protestants in the Sixteenth Century_.)\r\n\r\n[1064] Fourquevaux (February 15, 1567), I, 180, 181. Granvella\r\napparently, immediately after learning of the image breaking, and\r\nanticipating that either the King himself or the duke of Alva, would\r\nhave to go to Brussels, sent a remarkable memoir to Philip II, in which\r\nhe discusses all the various routes by which he might go, and the\r\nadvantages and disadvantages of each of them. The physical difficulties\r\nof governing the Low Countries from Madrid are very evident (see\r\nPoulet, I, 469-80).\r\n\r\n[1065] The Pope’s nuncio had pointed out to Philip II what a splendid\r\nachievement the overcoming of Geneva would be for Christendom. The\r\nscheme was an old one. See a letter of Pius IV to Francis II, June\r\n14, 1560, in Raynaldus, XXXIV, 64, col. 2. The King, after some weeks\r\nof consideration, declared that he could not think of it; that even\r\nthe duke of Savoy was against the project. (See Gachard, _Corresp.\r\nde Philippe II_, II, 552, and his _Les bibliothèques de Madrid et de\r\nl’Escurial_, 100.) On the political ambition of the duke of Savoy see\r\n_Rel. vén._, I, 453. He had made a treaty with Bern in 1565 (Collection\r\nGodefroy, XCIV, fol. 21). There are three excellent German monographs\r\non Switzerland in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: Planta, _Die\r\nGeschichte von Graubunden in ihren Hauptzügen_, Bern, 1892; _idem_,\r\n_Chronik der Familie von Planta_, Zurich, 1892; Salis-Soglio, _Die\r\nFamilie von Salis_, Lincau-im-B., 1891.

The official roster is in the\r\n_Correspondencia_, No. CXXII.\r\n\r\n[1069] “The front of every company by a new invention was flanked with\r\nfifteen supernumeraries, armed with musketoones, and rests wherein they\r\nlaid the barrow that could not be managed by the hands. For before his\r\ntime, such huge muskets as unmanageable were drawn upon carriages and\r\nonly used at sieges, from whence being transmitted into the field, and\r\nthose that carry them mixed with the lesser musketeers, they have been\r\nfound extraordinarily serviceable in battle.”—Stapylton’s transl. of\r\nStrada, Book VI, 31.\r\n\r\nBrantôme’s statement is more graphic: “Il fut luy le premier qui leur\r\ndonna en main les gros mousquetz, et que l’on veid les premiers en\r\nguerre et parmy les compagnies; et n’en avions point veu encores parmy\r\nleurs bandes, lors que nous allasmes pour le secours de Malte; dont\r\ndespuis nous en avons pris l’usage parmy nos bandes, mais avec de\r\ngrandes difficultéz à y accoustumer nos soldats comme j’en parle au\r\nlivre des couronnelz. Et ces mousquetz estonnzarent fort les Flamans,\r\nquand ilz les sentirent sonner à leurs oreilles; car ilz n’en avoient\r\nveu non plus que nous: et ceux qui les portoient les nommoit-on\r\nMousquetaires; très bien appoinctéz et respectéz, jusques à avoir de\r\ngrands et forts gojatz qui les leur portoient, et avoient quatre ducats\r\nde paye; et ne leur portoient qu’en cheminant par pays: mais quand ce\r\nvenoit en une faction, ou marchans en battaille, ou entrans en garde\r\nou en quelque ville, les prenoient. Et eussiez dict que c’estoient des\r\nprinces, tant ils estoient rogues et marchoient arrogamment et de belle\r\ngrace: et lors de quelque combat ou escarmouche, vous eussiez ouy crier\r\nces mots par grand respect: _Salgan, salgan los mosqueteros! Afuera,\r\nafuera, adelante los mosqueteros!_ Soudain on leur faisoit place; et\r\nestoient respectéz, voire plus que capitaines pour lors, à cause de\r\nla nouveauté, ainsy que toute nouveauté plaist.”—Brantôme, _Vies des\r\nGrands Capitaines_: “Le Grand Duc d’Albe.”\r\n\r\n[1070] Mendoza, _Comentarios_, II, chaps. i-iii. There is a French\r\ntranslation of this work by Loumier (Soc. de l’histoire de Belge), 2\r\nvols., 1860.\r\n\r\n[1071] “The duke arrived in the Low Countries offending none in his\r\npassage nor being himself offended by any one, though the French\r\nappeared in arms upon the marches of Burgundy and Colonel Tavannes\r\nby command from the French king with 4,000 foot and some troops were\r\ndefence of course of the borders, ‘costed’ the Spanish army. Indeed I\r\ndo not think that ever army marched so far and kept stricter rules of\r\ndiscipline, so that from Italy even to the Low Countries, not only no\r\ntowns but not any cottage was forced or injured.”—Strada, VI, 31.\r\n\r\nThe only instance of plundering seems to have been in the case of\r\nthe property of the prince of Orange in Burgundy (_C. S. P. For._,\r\n1562, August 7, 1567). This discipline is all the more remarkable,\r\nconsidering the fact that there were fifteen hundred women with the\r\narmy. “Lon a sceu le passaige du duc d’Albe et de sa trouppe; quon dict\r\nestre de six mille espaignolz et quinze cens femmes.”—Guyon to M. de\r\nGordes, July 11, 1567. Cited by the duc d’Aumale, _Histoire des princes\r\nde Condé_, I, Appendix XVI.\r\n\r\n[1072] Poulet, II, 183, December 25, 1566.\r\n\r\n[1073] Morillon to Granvella, April 7, 1566: “Pas ce boult veult l’on\r\ngaigner le magistrat des villes et le peuple: que ne sera si facille\r\ncomme l’on pense.”—Poulet, I, 203. The following is explicit: “Et\r\ndict encores plus que, s’il se fust joinct à la première lighe des\r\nseigneurs, la religion fust bien avant venue, car de là, dict-il,\r\n‘tanquam ex fonte emanasse has undas,’ et que le Roy le doibt entendri\r\nainse et y pourveoir avant toutte euvre, puisque de celle là est née la\r\nseconde de la religion.”—Poulet, II, 75. Cf. 118: “la première lighe\r\net la secunde engendrée d’icelle.”—Granvella to Viglius, November\r\n23, 1566. As late as May 9, 1567, it is called “la gentille ligue”\r\n(Poulet, II, 434). Granvella, in a letter to Philip in 1563, attributed\r\nthe formation of the association to Count Hoorne (_Papiers d’état du\r\ncardinal de Granvelle_, VIII, 12). Noircarmes, who was better informed,\r\nmakes Brederode the moving spirit of it (Poulet, II, 613, 614).\r\n\r\nThe Gueux even had a branch organization, though one historically\r\ndifferent in origin, in Franche Comté, in the Confrérie de Ste. Barbe.\r\nThe seigneurs of the house of Rye enjoyed high civil and ecclesiastical\r\nstation in both Burgundies in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.\r\nMarc and Claude François of Rye, father and son, were rivals and\r\npolitical enemies of the Perrenots—the family of Granvella and\r\nChantonnay—and regarded them as upstarts. The Confrérie de Ste. Barbe\r\nwas organized by them in Franche Comté on lines similar to the Gueux\r\nand had dealings with the latter—the members even wearing their\r\nemblem. Cardinal Granvella accused the seigneurs of Rye of aiming to\r\nestablish Protestantism, in Franche Comté from Flanders. This probably\r\nwas true but in a less degree. Protestant agitation was a means to\r\nan end, not an end in itself, it seems to me. If otherwise, such a\r\n_catholic_ title for the association is very singular. On the Confrérie\r\nde Ste. Barbe consult Poulet, I, 29; II, 44, 141. I am somewhat\r\ninclined to think that Tavanne’s Confraternity of the Holy Spirit in\r\nducal Burgundy may not impossibly have been influenced by the Confrérie\r\nde Ste. Barbe in the adjoining county of Burgundy, for Tavannes had a\r\nlong political conflict with the Parlement of Dôle in Franche-Comté\r\n(see Collection Godefroy, CCLVII, Nos. 22, 23), and was familiar with\r\nthings there.\r\n\r\n[1074] Poulet, I, 223.\r\n\r\n[1075] _Ibid._, II, 269. This revised form of the Gueux in which\r\nCalvinism is interjected is often alluded to as the “second league” in\r\nthe letters which pass between Granvella and the provost Morillon, e.\r\ng., _ibid._, 280, 437, 600.\r\n\r\n[1076] Poulet, II, 42.\r\n\r\n[1077] For some examples see _ibid._, 183.\r\n\r\n[1078] This organization seems to have been perfected by February,\r\n1567. Poulet, II, 244, has a brief note on this matter. For an\r\nextended article see _Bulletin historique et littéraire de la société\r\nde l’hist. du protestantisme Français_, March, 1879. Cf. Gachard,\r\n_Corresp. de Guill. le Taciturne_, II, cx, cxi, and notes. Marnix was\r\ntreasurer-general of the confederation (Poulet, II, 262, n. 1).\r\n\r\n[1079] Poulet, II, 335, 336, 396. “Sine qua factum nihil,” wrote the\r\nprovost, whose conception of government was Draconian in simplicity, to\r\nhis confidential friend (_ibid._, 353).\r\n\r\n[1080] _Ibid._, 469 and 508.\r\n\r\n[1081] _Ibid._, 396, 438.\r\n\r\n[1082] See Gachard, _Corresp. de Philippe II_, 461, 471, 473; Poulet,\r\nI, 461, 521; II, 102, 106, 139, 143, 187, 394, 440, 451, 659, 675.\r\n\r\n[1083] Morillon to Granvella, August 31, 1567, in Poulet, II, 605:\r\n“La première chose que l’on doibt faire sera de munir et asseurer les\r\nfrontières et renvoier chascun à son gouvernement, d’aultant que les\r\nFrançois semblent voulloir esmouvoir, du moingz les Hugonaux.” The\r\ncardinal had advised the duke of Alva to do this in the May preceding,\r\nwhen he was at Genoa on his way northward (Poulet, II, 448, 454).\r\n\r\nMontluc’s repeated warnings to Philip II, in the course of their\r\nsecret correspondence, of the succor French Calvinists were giving to\r\nhis Flemish rebels (K. 1,506, Nos. 46-48) led the King to enlarge the\r\nsystem of espionage which he maintained in France. The movements of\r\nthe admiral, the prince of Condé, and other leaders, were carefully\r\nreported (_Commentaires et lettres de Montluc_, V, 75, note). On the\r\nwhole practice see Forneron, I, chap. xi.\r\n\r\n[1084] Mundt to Cecil from Strasburg, July 8, 1567 (_C. S. P.

St. Sulpice had held\r\nsimilar language in 1564: “Le meilleur moyen pour le prince\r\nd’avoir la paix est d’être toujours en état de repousser ses\r\nvoisins.”—_L’Ambassade de. St. Sulpice_, 269.\r\n\r\n[1087] _C. S. P. For._, No. 1,402, July 6, 1567. Sir Henry Norris\r\nwrites to Cecil on March 25, 1567: “A better time than this could not\r\nbe found to demand Calais, they being in such distrust of their own\r\nforce, wherefore it might be understood that some preparation of arms\r\nwas making in England.”—_Ibid._, No. 1,048. A year earlier than this\r\nCecil had been advised to make common cause with the Emperor, the one\r\nto recover the Three Bishoprics, the other Calais (_ibid._, No. 326,\r\nApril 29, 1566; cf. _ibid._, _Ven._, 394, July 3, 1567). There is a\r\nbrief account of the negotiations in _Bulletins de la Comm. royale\r\nd’histoire_, séries IV, Vol. V, 386 ff. Cf. _C. S. P.

S. P. For._, No. 1,644.\r\nCatherine de Medici ordered the dispersal of the Huguenot bands on the\r\nPicard border in 1567 (_R. Q. H._, January, 1899, p. 21).\r\n\r\n[1091] The words are from a letter of Sir Henry Norris to the earl\r\nof Leicester in _C. S. P. For._, No. 1,537, July 21, 1567, and sound\r\nlike a paraphrase of the admiral’s language. The implication is that\r\nColigny’s withdrawal had some connection with the purported stealing of\r\nAlava’s cipher in the May before. See _C. S. P. For._, No. 1,230, May\r\n24, 1567. But according to Fourquevaux, I, 227, the Spanish ambassador\r\naccused Catherine de Medici of the stealing, _not_ Coligny. If this\r\nbe true, then Coligny must have wanted to find a pretext for leaving\r\nthe court without arousing the suspicion or animosity of the King,\r\nas might have been the case if he had done so openly out of sympathy\r\nfor the prince of Condé. Claude Haton, I, 406, says that Coligny\r\nwas piqued because Strozzi was given the command of the new forces\r\ninstead of himself. The prince of Condé retired to Valéry, Coligny to\r\nChâtillon. D’Andelot soon afterward followed suit, resigning his post\r\nas colonel-general of infantry on the ground that the marshal Cossé\r\nrefused to obey his orders, and retired to Tanlay near Tonnerre. The\r\nfine château is still standing.\r\n\r\nThenceforward it was of interest to the prince to stir up doubt and\r\ndistrust among the Huguenots by misrepresenting the true reasons for\r\nthe crown’s military preparation (_Correspondance de Catherine de\r\nMédicis_, III, Introd., vi; _C. S. P. For._, _anno_ 1567, p. 305).\r\n\r\n[1092] _C. S. P. For._, No. 1,629, August 23, 1567.\r\n\r\n[1093] Claude Haton, I, 405.\r\n\r\n[1094] _C. S. P.

After the prince’s\r\nsecond marriage she wedded Geoffrey de Caumont (Claude Haton, I, 363).\r\nSee also Clément-Simon, _La Maréchale de Saint-André et ses filles_,\r\nParis, 1896.\r\n\r\n[1100] The rendezvous was at Rosay-en-Brie (La Popelinière, Book XII,\r\n37; D’Aubigné, IV, chap, vii; Claude Haton, I, 424, 425).\r\n\r\n[1101] The Venetian ambassador Correro, in his relation of the\r\nconspiracy, expresses astonishment that the secret of the Huguenot\r\nleaders did not leak out, and attributes the fact to the perfection of\r\nthe Protestant organization (quoted by La Ferrière in _Correspondance\r\nde Catherine de Médicis_, III, ix). It seems to me that this feature\r\nwas less due to perfect organization than to the promptitude with which\r\nCondé and Coligny endeavored to carry out the project. The lesson\r\nof the conspiracy of Amboise seven years before could not have been\r\nlost upon them. Moreover, the queen mother did have some intimation,\r\nnotwithstanding her surprise when the shock came. For on September 10,\r\nwhile the court was staying at Monceaux, some armed bands of horsemen\r\nwere seen hovering around, which caused the King’s hasty removal to\r\nMeaux (_C. S. P.

Within a month the Pope’s word began to be made good,\r\nfor 10,000 pieces of gold were en route to France in the middle of\r\nNovember.—Potter, p. 10 (ed.

In it the Pope says he has\r\nwritten the duke of Lorraine to stop the reiters about to enter France.\r\n\r\n[1142] The question of payment of the Swiss still remained to be\r\nsettled and Charles IX was at his wits’ end and actually offered\r\na mortgage of his frontier towns, save Lyons and the frontier of\r\nBurgundy, paying 5 per cent. interest in order to quiet the importunate\r\ndemands of the cantons.—_Revue d’histoire diplomatique_, XIV (1900),\r\n49, 50.\r\n\r\n[1143] Request of Charles IX to the bishop of Mainz to permit the\r\nreiters to pass, December 9, 1567.—Coll.

Although the prince\r\nof Condé in December declared that he had not entered into a treaty\r\nwith the Flemish Calvinists (_ibid._, 143), it is probable that these\r\nproposals were accepted some months later.

For the duke of Montpensier and the duke of Montmorency\r\neach claimed command of the vanguard. The King finally decided in favor\r\nof the former, whereupon Montmorency laid down his command. See Claude\r\nHaton, I, 461, 462 and note; _Bulletin de la Societé d’histoire de\r\nNormandie_, 1875-80, p. 279; _C. S. P. For._, No. 1,833, November 24;\r\nNo. 1,837, November 29, 1567; _Nég.

For._, No. 1,822, November 16, 1567; cf. No. 1,836.\r\nWe know, from a letter of Charles IX to his brother, what the King’s\r\nterms would have been: (1) in the case of nobles, authorization of\r\nProtestant worship to those possessed of high justice or possessors of\r\n“pleins fiefs de haubert” i. e., fiefs that were noble, yet did not\r\nconfer title, provided it were conducted within their own dwellings\r\nin the presence of their families and not more than fifty outside\r\npersons, and without arms; (2) absolute limitation of other worship to\r\nthe places specifically granted in the edict of Amboise; (3) surrender\r\nof places and property seized by the Huguenots; (4) suppression of the\r\nProtestant cult within the walls of Lyons, but permission to worship\r\nat two leagues’ distance from the city; (5) interdiction of levies\r\nof money or men in the future and the discontinuance of Protestant\r\nassociations and synods.—_Correspondance de Catherine de Médicis_, II,\r\nIntrod., xiv. It is a very remarkable fact that these precise terms had\r\nbeen recommended to Charles IX as a basis of settlement by Montluc in a\r\nmemoir sent to the King in February 1565. See _Commentaires et lettres\r\nde Montluc_, V, 3-9. Montluc made the further recommendation that the\r\ngovernments be divided by _sénéchaussées_ instead of by rivers, on the\r\nground that rivers sometimes divided towns into two jurisdictions. His\r\nfriction with Damville (cf. _ibid._, 103-6) probably accounts for the\r\nproposed change. Montluc also advised abolition of the _vice-sénéchaux_\r\n(_ibid._, 8).\r\n\r\n[1158] See the proclamation of Charles IX commanding the provost Paris\r\nto search out all gentlemen who have retired to their homes since the\r\nbattle of St. Denis; and ordering them to return to the army under\r\npain of forfeiture of their fiefs and property. Printed in Appendix\r\nXII. In the second part of _Coll. de St. Pétersbourg_, Vol. XXI, is\r\na group of letters from Charles IX to the duke of Anjou running from\r\nDecember 2, 1567. In every page the question of the military operations\r\nof the second civil war comes up. It is evident that the gentlemen of\r\nthe _maison du roi_ complained loudly of the service required of them,\r\nespecially because they were so ill lodged.—La Ferrière, _Deux ans de\r\nmission à St. Pétersbourg_, 24.\r\n\r\n[1159] During the occupation of the army all Protestant children who\r\nhad been baptized in the Reformed religion by preachers were rebaptized\r\naccording to the rites of the Roman religion, and godfathers and\r\ngodmothers were given them and new names which were approved by the\r\nchurch.—Claude Haton, I, 512 and note.\r\n\r\n[1160] Claude Haton, I, 504-12.\r\n\r\n[1161] On December 6 he published a declaration in favor of the\r\nHuguenots.—_Bulletin de la Société du prot. franç._ XVI, 118.

His resolution to assist the Huguenots led to the dismissal\r\nof his ambassador at the French court on December 17th.—_Ibid._, No.\r\n1,889. In _ibid._, No. 1,956 there is an abstract of a long letter\r\nof the elector palatine written to Charles IX in remonstrance of the\r\naction of the King, and in justification of his own course.\r\n\r\n[1164] A meeting of the electors was called for January 6, 1568, at\r\nFulda, ostensibly for the purpose of preventing German enrolments\r\nfor the war in France, but in reality that the Emperor might broach\r\nthe possibility of recovering the Three Bishoprics.—Mundt to Cecil,\r\nJanuary 6, 1568 in _C. S. P. For._, No. 1,927. I cannot understand how\r\nHubert Languet could have fallen into the error of thinking that the\r\nqueen mother made no opposition to the enlistment of troops in Germany\r\nfor the Huguenot cause, as he says in _Epp. Arc._, I, 43. The statement\r\npuzzled Ranke (p. 233) who left it unsolved. The dispatch of Norris\r\nin _C. S. P. For._, No. 1,864, December 15, 1567, to the effect that\r\nLignerolles was sent to Germany by the queen for this purpose clears\r\nup the matter. Catherine’s correspondence fails us on this head. But\r\nit is well known that many of her letters are scattered in private\r\ncollections and were not procurable by La Ferrière.\r\n\r\n[1165] Alva had no flattering opinion of the cardinal of Lorraine.\r\nIn 1572 he wrote to Philip II: “Quand en faveur il est insolent et\r\nne se souvient de personne, tandis que, quand il est en disgrace, il\r\nn’est bon à rien.”—Gachard, _Correspondance de Philippe II sur les\r\nPays-Bas_, II, 267.\r\n\r\n[1166] Gachard, _ibid._, I, 593, 594, Alva to Philip, November 1, 1567.\r\nOn the margin of this dispatch Philip wrote this piece of casuistry\r\nwith his own hand: “Me parece muy bien que hiziese lo que aqui dice, y\r\ntanto mas que aquello no hera romper la paz, pues yo no la hizé, ni la\r\ntengo, sino con el rey de Francia, y no con sus vasallos ereges, como\r\nseria, si esto se hiziese no estando él libre, como aqui se dice.”\r\n\r\n[1167] “En caso de muerte del rey y de sus hermanos, tomarse ya la voz\r\nque el cardinal dize de rey de Francia para V. M., por el derecho de\r\nla reyna nuestra señora; que la ley salica, que dizen, es baya, y las\r\narmas la allanarian” (_ibid._, 594).\r\n\r\n[1168] “Esto es el punto en que me parece que ay mas que mirar, porqué\r\nesto se podria mal hazer sin romper; y por otra parte, parece que seria\r\nduro dexar de abrazar á quien por tal causa se pone en mys manos; y\r\npues creo que por este caso avra tiempo, qu’él me avise de su parecer\r\nsobre ello, segun allá estubienen las cosas.”—Gachard, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n[1169] Philip II approved this.—Gachard, _Correspondance de Philippe\r\nII_, I, 598: to Alva, November 12, 1567.\r\n\r\n[1170] Gachard, I, 606-7, from Paris, December 4, 1567; _Correspondance\r\nde Catherine de Médicis_, Letter CLII; _Correspondance de Philippe II_,\r\nI, 605-7. The queen mother seems to have been frightened after the\r\nbattle of St. Denis for she disclaims blame in advance, “before God and\r\nall the Christian princes,” if, in default of help, she be forced to\r\nmake peace with the prince of Condé. At about the same time, she also\r\nwrote to Philip II in the same strain (quoted in part by Forneron, I,\r\n348 from K. 1,507, No. 29). I do not find that this letter has been\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\n[1171] _Correspondance de Catherine de Médicis_, II, 62.\r\n\r\n[1172] Gachard, _Correspondance de Philippe II sur les Pays-Bas_, I,\r\n608.\r\n\r\n[1173] “Porqué seria mala burla yr á meter fuego en casa agena,\r\ncomençandose á arder la propria.”—_Ibid._, 597: Alva to Philip II,\r\nNovember 6, 1567.\r\n\r\n[1174] It was à propos of Catherine de Medici’s weakness at this time\r\nthat the marshal Vieilleville bluntly said to Charles IX.: “Ce n’est\r\npoint Votre Majesté qui a gagné la bataille [of St. Denis]; encore\r\nmoins le prince de Condé. C’est le roi d’Espagne.”—Weiss, _L’Espagne\r\nsous Philippe II_, I, 119.\r\n\r\n[1175] On the military state of Sens at this time see Charles IX’s\r\npostscript to his mother’s letter to Fourquevaux of December 7 in\r\n_Correspondance de Catherine de Médicis_, III, 89, note.\r\n\r\n[1176] Norris, writing to Queen Elizabeth on December 15, in one place\r\nsays, “the reiters are 4,000 with 4,000 lansquenets” (§2); later\r\nin the course of the same letter, which is a long one and probably\r\nthe information of several days running, he says, “6,800 with 6,000\r\nlansquenets” (_C. S. P. For._, No. 1,864, December 15, 1567). This\r\nseems to be confirmed by another report from France, December 26, which\r\nsays “the reiters who have arrived amount to 6,500 men” (_ibid._, No.\r\n1,882).\r\n\r\n[1177] _Ibid._, No. 1,864 §2, No. 1,882, December 15-26, 1567. The\r\nreiters came “with certain pieces of artillery and 700 or 800 empty\r\nwagons, trusting to be no greater losers by this dissension than by the\r\nlast” (_ibid._, No. 1,864, §3. Norris to Elizabeth).\r\n\r\n[1178] _Ibid._, No. 1,889, December 28, 1567; No. 1,911, January 3,\r\n1568. In _ibid._, Nos. 1,976 and 2,011, the following is given as the\r\nstrength of the two armies: “Army of the King, 20,600 horsemen and\r\n10,000 Swiss footmen; the numbers of the other footmen are not set\r\ndown. Condé’s army, footmen 13,000; horsemen 11,900 where of reiters\r\n6,200”—January, 1568. List of the troops of the prince of Condé with\r\ntheir commanders, amounting in all to 15,000 or 16,000 foot, and 14,000\r\nhorse, exclusive of those in garrison or serving in other parts of\r\nFrance—February 15, 1568. Norris wrote in February, 1568: “The prince\r\nhas crossed the Seine, and is at present nothing inferior in number\r\nto the King’s army in infantry, but they are not esteemed so good for\r\nbattle by reason of the Switzers. He has 3,000 more cavalry than the\r\nking has.”—_Ibid._, No. 1,981.\r\n\r\n[1179] _C. S. P. For._, No. 1,864, §4, December 15, 1567. Names of\r\nthe different noblemen commanding in the army of the King of France\r\n(_ibid._, No. 1,918, January 4, 1568). Letters-patent of Charles IX,\r\ndated December 16, 1567, ordered the exodus of all of the “pretended\r\nReformed religion” from Paris and enjoined the seizure of all their\r\nbenefices and lands, which were to be annexed to the crown property,\r\nand the sale of all the goods of such subjects (_ibid._, Nos. 1,877,\r\n1,878, December 21-24, 1567). In January a supplementary order\r\ncommanded the sale of all goods and movables of those with the prince\r\nof Condé, and the annexation of all their lands and hereditaments to\r\nthe crown (_ibid._, 1,914, January 3, 1568)—decrees which “were not\r\nleft unexecuted in any point to the utmost” (Norris to Cecil, _ibid._,\r\nNo. 1,889, December 28, 1567, §1). Cf. Charles IX’s letters-patent of\r\nFebruary 21, 1568, bidding that the houses and real property held by\r\nbase tenure belonging to rebels shall be sold in the same manner as\r\npersonal property (_ibid._, No. 2,200, February 21, 1568). The same\r\nsort of measures were practiced elsewhere. For instance, in Agen,\r\nProtestant merchants suffered confiscation of grain and wine to the\r\namount of 1,014 livres, 7 sous (_Arch. Commun._, Agen, Reg. CC, 302).\r\n\r\n[1180] The original letter of Charles IX, written from Paris, December\r\n17, 1567 to the duke of Anjou, reciting the terms of peace to be\r\npresented to the prince of Condé was sold in Paris in 1845. The duke’s\r\ninstructions were to renew hostilities if the terms were not accepted.\r\nIn Coll. Godefroy, XCVI, No. 8, is the safe-conduct given to the\r\ncardinal Châtillon by the duke of Anjou. It is dated December 25, 1567.\r\n\r\n[1181] _C. S. P.

The amounts reduced from\r\nFrench to English money by Cecil (_C. S. P. For._, No. 1,978, January\r\n1568).\r\n\r\n[1185] _Ibid._, No. 1,914, January 3, 1568.

It is now said that Mons. de Tavannes shall be M. d’Anjou’s\r\nlieutenant” (_ibid._, No. 2,024, February 24, 1568).\r\n\r\n[1189] Some of them were captured by the King’s forces in a skirmish\r\nnear Châtillon between the duke of Nevers and Montgomery, and broken\r\nupon the wheel. The poor wretches under the torture compromised\r\ntwenty-five others of the Guard, who on March 6 were also horribly\r\nput to death (_ibid._, No. 2,062, March 12, 1568). After the peace of\r\nLongjumeau the Scotch captains who had joined the prince of Condé were\r\ndeprived of their commissions, although the action was contrary to the\r\nedict. In fact a reorganization of the whole _maison du roi_ was made\r\n(_ibid._, No. 2,135, April 18, No. 2,178, May 12, 1568). The vacancies\r\nwere filled by Swiss instead (_ibid._, Nos. 1,981, 1,987, February 1\r\nand 6, 1568), so that the famous Scotch Guard in the end became the\r\nKing’s Swiss Guard, which lasted down to the Revolution.\r\n\r\n[1190] _Ibid._, No. 1,981, February 1, 1568.\r\n\r\n[1191] He was accused of having “pretermitted many fair occasions to\r\nhave fought with the prince.”\r\n\r\n[1192] _Ibid._, No. 2,024, §2, February 24, 1568.\r\n\r\n[1193] Claude Haton, I, 498 and note; _C.

But in May, with the promise of a good harvest,\r\nthe price dropped over one-half, from 15 sous tournois per bichet to 7\r\nsous 6 deniers, to the great regret of the merchants who had counted\r\nupon a scarcity. On the other hand, the price of oats went higher,\r\nbeing sold at from 10 to 12 sous per bichet, or boisseau, for there was\r\nvery little to be had after the passage of the troops; and because it\r\nripened earlier, almost all of it was taken (Claude Haton, II, 523).\r\n\r\n[1196] _C. S. P. For._, No. 2,024, February 24, 1568.\r\n\r\n[1197] So ominous was the temper of the Parisians that even the minor\r\ngates of the Louvre were equipped with drawbridges (_ibid._, No.\r\n2,040, §4, March 1, 1568). Part of the indignation of Paris was due to\r\nthe outrages of some reiters in the King’s army from Luxembourg and\r\nLorraine, who robbed priests and despoiled churches, notwithstanding\r\nthat they were in Catholic service, so much so that “the Parisians had\r\nrather had the prince of Condé’s people should approach Paris as they”\r\n(_ibid._, Nos. 2,040, 2,041, March 1, 1568).\r\n\r\n[1198] _Rel. vén._, II, 145.\r\n\r\n[1199] _C.

La Rochelle\r\nwas already the Huguenots’ most important point and already large\r\nsupplies of gunpowder and ammunition, chiefly from England, were being\r\nbrought in there (cf. the captain of La Rochelle to Queen Elizabeth,\r\n_C. S. P. For._, No. 2,057, March 10, 1568). La Popelinière, XII,\r\n68-70, has a dissertation upon the history and institutions of La\r\nRochelle.\r\n\r\nThe peace of Longjumeau put an end to Montluc’s plan for the seizure of\r\nLa Rochelle, for which he had received the King’s sanction in February.\r\nSee the documents in F. Fr. 15,544, fol. 187; 15,548, foll. 163 ff.\r\n\r\n[1201] In the controversy between the count palatine and the King the\r\nformer had asked that the word “perpetual” be inserted in the edict,\r\nso that the edict might not be revoked at will (_C. S. P. For._, No.\r\n1,968, 1567-68).\r\n\r\n[1202] The balance was to be paid in two instalments at Frankfurt (_C.\r\nS. P. For._, No. 2,135, April 18, 1568). All gifts and pensions were\r\nrevoked until the debt was paid (_ibid._, No. 2,248, June 4, 1568).\r\nIn Coll. Godefroy, CCLVII, Nos. 35, 41-43 are a number of documents\r\ndealing with the pay of the reiters at this time. The whole sum\r\nrequired for the reiters was 1,440,000 livres, and the government at\r\nonce set to work to collect it. The first collection seems to have\r\nbeen a sort of _don patriotique_ made by a house-to-house visitation,\r\nshowing how pressing was the necessity. The government tried to borrow\r\nthe money which John Casimir had raised for the Protestants, but which\r\nwas not used on account of the peace, and offered to pay 16 per cent.\r\ninterest for it (_C. S. P. For._, March 28, 1568). On March 23 the King\r\nissued letters patent forbidding all notaries and others receiving any\r\ncontract for annuities or mortgages before the sum of 1,400,000 livres\r\n_tournois_ had been raised (_ibid._, No. 2,085). The duke of Alva was\r\nin a state of great anxiety for fear lest the reiters would come into\r\nthe Netherlands and thought he discovered a plot to throw St. Omer into\r\ntheir hands (_ibid._, No. 2,230, April 25, 1568).\r\n\r\nAll the records abound with allusions to the rapacity of the reiters:\r\n“La nazione tedesca, nazione avara” (_Rel. vén._, II, 125 and notes).\r\n\r\n“Les reîtres trouvaient beaucoup meilleur l’argent qu’on leur\r\npromettait d’Angleterre que les cidres de Normandie.”—La Noue.\r\n\r\n“L’importunità dei Tedeschi che mai cessavano de domandare donazioni o\r\npaghe.”—Davila, I, 137.\r\n\r\n“Ils consommeraient un gouffre d’argent—Facheux, avares,\r\nimportuns.”—Brantôme, III, 196, 310.\r\n\r\n[1203] But restricted as they were, the terms yet mightily offended the\r\nGuises, especially the cardinal of Lorraine who “did marvellously storm\r\nthat the king would condescend to any peace with his subjects, whereat\r\nthe king said he would agree thereto ‘maugre luy.’” (On the entire\r\nnegotiations see _C. S. P. For._, No. 2,025, Feb. 24; Nos. 2,040-41,\r\nMarch 1-4; No. 2,054, March 9; Nos. 2,057, 2,058, March 10-11; No.\r\n2,092, March 27, 1568). The final draft was completed on March 23; the\r\nedict was signed by Charles IX on March 26. It was published at Paris\r\non the next day (_ibid._, Nos. 2,092-93).\r\n\r\n[1204] _Ibid._, No. 2,058, March 11, 1568. Granvella expressed fear\r\nof universal famine in France, followed by the plague (Gachard,\r\n_Correspondance de Philippe II_, II, 17).\r\n\r\n[1205] The preachers and the doctors in Paris in their sermons decried\r\nthe King and his Council (Claude Haton, II, 527 and note; cf. _ibid._,\r\n531; _Rel. vén._, II, 121).\r\n\r\n[1206] _C.

(_Hist. du Languedoc_,\r\nV, 449). His own words are: “Pour se montrer au peuple, qui avoit une\r\nmarvelleuse envie de le voir, n’y pouvant arrêter à cause de la grande\r\npeste qui y est.” (Cf. his letters to Damville, December 31, 1567, and\r\nAugust 26, 1569, in _Commentaires et lettres de Montluc_, V, 103 and\r\n159.) Montluc was doubly incensed at this moment because the peace of\r\nLongjumeau canceled orders which he had received in February to attempt\r\nto take La Rochelle by sea (_ibid._, VII, 148 ff.; V, 107 note, 109\r\nnote, 184 note).\r\n\r\n[1211] _Bulletin de la Soc. acad. du Var_, 1876.\r\n\r\n[1212] Claude Haton, II, 525. He repeats at different times the\r\ncurrent play upon words which designated these free-booting nobles as\r\n“gens-pille-hommes” (gentilhommes). In general, in his estimation, the\r\nnobility had much degenerated. See Vol. I, Introd., p. lxii.\r\n\r\n[1213] Volunteer bands of searchers visited Huguenot houses, to inquire\r\ninto their faith (_C. S. P. For._, No. 2,191, May 17, 1568). At the\r\ncourt, certain of the nobles promised Charles to assure for all members\r\nof their retinue to be good Catholics (_ibid._, Nos. 2,191, 2,235,\r\n2,236, 2,243, 2,248, May 17 to June 4, 1568).\r\n\r\n[1214] “D’Anjou has marvellously stomached these dealings, and has kept\r\nhis chamber, having uttered most despiteful words against them of the\r\nreligion, saying that he hoped to march upon their bellies” (_C. S. P.\r\nFor._, No. 2,177, May 12, 1568).\r\n\r\n[1215] _Ibid._, No. 2,115, §1, April 8, 1568.\r\n\r\n[1216] See the revelations of Norris to Cecil in _ibid._, No. 2,100,\r\nMarch 30, 1568. As earnest of the royal purpose the marshal Montmorency\r\nset at once about disarming the people of Paris.\r\n\r\n[1217] _Commentaires et lettres de Montluc_, V, 22, 23.\r\n\r\n[1218] Probably neither the cardinal nor Montluc knew that the other\r\nhad been in secret correspondence with Philip II. Knowing Philip’s\r\nmethods, it is likely that he kept them in ignorance of it. This was\r\nhis way (cf. Forneron, I, 327).\r\n\r\n[1219] Ruble, _Commentaires et lettres de Montluc_, IV, 328, 329,\r\nletter of March 5, 1564.\r\n\r\n[1220] _Ibid._, V, 76, 77 and notes.\r\n\r\n[1221] _Ibid._, V, 145.\r\n\r\n[1222] Cited by Forneron, _Histoire de Philippe II_, I, 327.\r\n\r\n[1223] The ordinance of Moulins specifically alluded to the growing\r\npopular nature of these confraternities: “Qu’on abolisse entièrement\r\nles confréries établies sous prétexte de religion parmi le _petit_\r\npeuple, les festins, les répas, les bâtons (bâtons de Confrérie,\r\nqui servent à porter aux confréries l’Image de quelque saint, ou la\r\nreprésentation de quelque mystère) et autres choses semblables, qui\r\ndonnent lieu à la superstition, aux troubles, à la débauche, aux\r\nquerelles, et aux monopoles” (De Thou, V, Book XXXIX, p. 183, in the\r\narticle prohibiting them). But it was as impossible then as now to\r\nenforce a law in the face of a public opinion which did not sympathize\r\nwith the provision. Public opinion not merely favored their formation;\r\nthe very officers of the crown promoted their organization. La\r\nPopelinière, XI, 12, makes this point.\r\n\r\n[1224] “Discorso sopra gli umori di Francia di M^[r]. Nazaret, 1570,”\r\nBarberini Library 3,269, fol. 63.

This league was much more formal\r\nin its organization than any of the others. In addition to securing the\r\nauthorization of the Parlement, the leaders had secured the sanction of\r\nPius V in the March _preceding_. The bull was granted March 15.\r\n\r\n[1233] _Cabinet historique_, II, 219.\r\n\r\n[1234] Bordenave, _Hist. de Béarn et de Navarre_, 139-45. I venture\r\nto suggest the cardinal of Lorraine as a possible instigator, from\r\nBordenave’s words: “quelques autres ... sollicitez par quelques uns\r\ndes _principaux du conseil_ de France.” Philip II threw new troops\r\ninto Spanish Navarre at this time, either in consequence of Jeanne\r\nd’Albret’s energetic action or to co-operate with the league, if it\r\nwere successful. Fourquevaux ascertained the fact, but was in the dark\r\nas to the reason for it (_Dépêches de Fourquevaux_, II, 25, November,\r\n1568).\r\n\r\n[1235] A letter of Coligny, July 29, 1568, shows that the Huguenot\r\nleader was aware of the formation of these provincial leagues. After\r\ncomplaining of the assassination of one of D’Andelot’s lieutenants,\r\nhe protests against the general violence: “Ce que faict croire que ce\r\nsont des fruictz et offices des confraires du Saint-Esprit et sainctes\r\nligues qu’ils appellent; mais si on voit que infiniz meurtres et\r\nmassacres qui se sont faictz avec une effrénée licence en tous les\r\nendroictz de ce royaume depuys la paciffication il n’en ayt esté faict\r\naucune justice ou chastiment, quelque déclaration que Vostre Majesté\r\nayt faicte de sa volonté et intention, je n’en espère pas davantage\r\nde cestuy-cy, estant bien facile à cognoistre que ce sont choses\r\nprojectées et délibérées avec les gouverneurs des provinces, et que\r\ncela ne se faict poinct sans adveu ou pour le moins sans un tacite\r\nconsentement.”—_Correspondance de Catherine de Médicis_, III, 163,\r\nnote.\r\n\r\n[1236] Montmorency continually threw his influence in favor of peace\r\nand moderation, slapping the Guises, however, in his utterances.\r\n“The Duke Montmorency said there was nothing more necessary for the\r\nmaintenance of the king’s estate than the sincere observance of the\r\nedict of pacification, and such as labour to the contrary are neither\r\nfriends to the king nor his crown; and for his own part if the king\r\ndid not foresee in time with due execution of justice this growing\r\nmischief, he was resolved with his leave to depart the court with his\r\nfriends and allies, and so to withdraw himself from such as under the\r\npretext of maintenance of their religion, continually nourished this\r\ndivision, and in the end put out the glory and renown of the French\r\nempire.”—_C. S. P. For._, No. 2,177, §1, May 12, 1568.\r\n\r\nOn June 17 Norris wrote to Cecil: “Montmorency has come to the court.\r\nThe process between him and the duke of Guise for the county of\r\nDammartin will in the end break into open enmity.”—_Ibid._, No. 2,273.\r\n\r\n[1237] “The four marshals agree all in one against the\r\nCardinal.”—_Ibid._, No. 2,235, May 31, 1568.\r\n\r\n[1238] “All things are ruled now by M. d’Anjou, who though young is a\r\nmost earnest and cruel enemy against the favourers of religion, and has\r\nhis privy counsellors, the cardinal of Lorraine being the chiefest, and\r\nfurther has his chancellor, who seals all such things as the good old\r\nchancellor of the King refuses to seal; who neither for love nor dread\r\nwould seal anything against the statutes of the realm.”—_Ibid._, No.\r\n2,178, May 12, 1568.

According to report, Lavallette was to have seized the\r\nprince, Chavigny the admiral, and Tavannes D’Andelot. The warning\r\nwas probably given by some secretary whom Coligny had corrupted, for\r\nshortly after this time several secretaries to the Catholic leaders\r\nwere dismissed (_ibid._, No. 2,256, June 7, 1568; cf. D’Aumale,\r\n_Histoire des princes de Condé_, II, 12, n. 2, and p. 287). Coligny\r\nalso bribed the secretary of Don Francesco de Alava, Spanish ambassador\r\nin France (see _C. S. P.

Hume, however, is in error, p. 115, in believing\r\nthat the negotiation arose _after_ the peace of St. Germain in 1570.\r\nThe intercourse must have been kept very much in the dark, judging from\r\nthe obscure allusions in the following: Sir Henry Norris to the earl\r\nof Leicester, _C. S. P.

Other sources of\r\nrevenue were a loan upon the security of the wine duties for several\r\nyears—a heavy burden upon the people (Claude Haton, II, 547)—which\r\nyielded about 300,000 crowns per annum. In addition, the King raised\r\na benevolence of 50,000 crowns from Paris, and Venice loaned 100,000\r\ncrowns (_C. S. P. For._, No. 2,640, November 22, 1568) later increased\r\nto 200,000. The Pope later authorized the sale of 50,000 crowns’ worth\r\nof the temporalities of the church, but the sales were so managed\r\nby certain of the clergy that the government got little from them\r\n(_ibid._, No. 233, April, 1569, summary of an ordinance of Charles IX).\r\n\r\n[1284] For details see Norris to Cecil, _C.

Things would have gone\r\nworse with the Protestants of Orleans had it not been for the Politique\r\nmarshal Vieilleville, whose government it was, and who did all in his\r\npower to protect the Huguenots (_ibid._, No. 190, March 24, 1569).\r\n\r\n[1288] Jeanne d’Albret, who had been at Nérac, reached La Rochelle on\r\nSeptember 28, having crossed the Garonne “under the nose of Montluc”\r\n(Olhagaray, 575), who, it is said, had orders to intercept her (Palma\r\nCayet, Part I, 166). Montluc glosses over his negligence in this\r\nparticular (_Commentaires_, III, 175).\r\n\r\n[1289] _C. S. P. For._, No. 2,561, September 30, 1568. D’Andelot was in\r\nBrittany, (_ibid._, No. 2,527, September 15, 1568), but on September\r\n16 he crossed the Loire (La Noue, chap. xix) with 1,500 horse and 20\r\nensigns of foot (D’Aubigné, III, 13, note 7) in spite of the strict\r\ninjunctions of the King to prevent him (D’Aubigné, III, 14, note).\r\n\r\n[1290] _C. S. P. For._, No. 2,610, §2, October 29, 1568. Duke William\r\nof Saxony earnestly begged Charles IX to employ his soldiery (_ibid._,\r\nNo. 2,640, §5, November 22, 1568) and the margrave of Baden accepted\r\na command of reiters in the King’s army (Le Laboureur, II, 724). The\r\nduke of Deuxponts offered 8,000 reiters and 40 ensigns of lansquenets\r\nto Condé (_C. S. P. For._, No. 2,666, §1, December 8, 1568). They were\r\nto have no pay for two months, expecting to pay themselves by seizing\r\nthe towns and castles belonging to the house of Guise in Lorraine and\r\nChampagne. In the end England paid for their services (see the record\r\nof the receipts in _C. S. P. For._, No. 2,011, September 10, 1571; No.\r\n2,123, November 13, 1571). The Catholic reiters were to be paid by a\r\nforced loan exacted of the Parisians (_ibid._, No. 2,666, December 8,\r\n1568).\r\n\r\n[1291] North to Cecil, _C. S. P.

The engagement of Jazeneuil that followed, November\r\n17, was a blow to them (see La Noue, chap. xxi; D’Aubigné, III, 37; _C.\r\nS. P. For._, No. 2,640, §1). The minute account of the duc d’Aumale\r\nmay be found in _Hist. des princes de Condé_, II, 26-34. Whitehead,\r\n_Gaspard de Coligny, Admiral of France_, 204-9, has an admirable\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n[1293] Condé’s army before the defeat at Jazeneuil was estimated at\r\n12,000 foot and 4,000 horse, all well mounted and armed, besides a very\r\nlarge number of irregular troops.\r\n\r\n[1294] Fourquevaux to Catherine de Medici, January 13, 1569, on the\r\nauthority of a letter of the Spanish ambassador in France, dated\r\nJanuary 7, 1568 (_Dépêches de Fourquevaux_, II, 47). Alava must have\r\nregarded the news as highly important, for the courier was only six\r\ndays in making the journey to Madrid.\r\n\r\n[1295] Fourquevaux, II, 31, 54.\r\n\r\n[1296] Coll. Godefroy, XCVI, William of Orange to Charles IX, December\r\n21, 1568.\r\n\r\n[1297] Alva sent word to Charles IX at all hazards to hold the prince\r\nof Condé back, himself promising to take care of Orange. The King sent\r\nthe Spanish duke a very large commission, not only to levy upon the\r\ncountry for necessities but even to enter the French walled towns—so\r\nfar were the two crowns now in accord (_C. S. P. For._, No. 2,666,\r\nDecember 8, 1568).\r\n\r\n[1298] The alarm of the government at this hour over Paris may be\r\nmeasured by two police regulations of the time. One ordered search to\r\nbe made throughout the town twice a week, in all hostelries and other\r\nplaces, and forbade mechanics to leave their houses on certain days.\r\nThe other allowed those of the religion who had been forbidden to leave\r\ntheir houses on certain days to appoint one of their servants to go\r\nabout the town on their affairs. He was to have a certificate signed\r\nby the captain and _commissaires_ of the quarter, and to be unarmed.\r\nThe _commissaires_ were to make a weekly search in the houses of those\r\nof the religion, to make _procès-verbal_ of the names of all the\r\ndomestics, signed by the master of the house, and to remove all arms\r\nfound therein (_ibid._, No. 2,671, December 11; No. 2,684, December\r\n23, 1568). Both ordinances were registered by the Parlement. During\r\nthe Christmas season no Calvinist was permitted to stir out of doors\r\n(_ibid._, No. 2,688, §3, December 26, 1568).\r\n\r\n[1299] “The good disposition and order that is kept in the prince’s\r\narmy is much to be commended, nothing like oppressing the country where\r\nthey pass, as that of M. d’Anjou, which was waxed hateful by their\r\ninsolent behavior, both to Protestants and Catholics. M. d’Anjou has\r\nbestowed the greatest part of his army in the towns upon the river of\r\nLoire.”—_C. S. P. For._, No. 12, January 4, 1569.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the royal army in Anjou, under the command of the duke\r\nof Anjou, was a heavy burden upon the people of the province, which\r\nalready had suffered heavily from the depredations of the Huguenots\r\nin the preceding year. The municipal council of Angers, on November\r\n4, was called upon to furnish 800 pairs of stockings, 1,500 pairs of\r\nshoes, powder, bread, hay, straw, oats, pikes, shovels, mattocks, and\r\nother implements. The town was filled with sick and wounded soldiers\r\n(Joubert, _Les misères de l’Anjou, etc._, 36).\r\n\r\n[1300] Orange was also in want of pay for his troops (Languet, _Epist.\r\nsecr._, I, 82).\r\n\r\n[1301] _Revue d’histoire diplomatique_, XIV (1900), 51-52, 64.\r\n\r\n[1302] _C.

In the council\r\nof the King a motion was made that the Protestants should be permitted\r\nto enjoy the benefit of the edicts granted before; that Condé should\r\nbe given the government of Saintonge, and be given leave to aid Orange\r\nagainst Spain. But neither Catherine de Medici nor the King would\r\nlisten to the proposal, and the cardinal of Lorraine argued that it\r\nwould be dangerous to further Condé in any way (_C. S. P.

The troops\r\nthat the King had were 26 companies of gendarmes, 15 companies of the\r\nregular French army, 4,500 Swiss, 2,500 reiters, and his household\r\ntroops. Montmorency retired to Chantilly owing to the combination\r\nagainst him (_C. S. P. For._, No. 75, January 25, 1569. For the details\r\nsee _Archives de la maison d’Orange-Nassau_, III, 315). There had\r\nbeen a fierce strife between the factions of Guise and Montmorency\r\nfor D’Aumale’s place, the three marshals, Montmorency, Vieilleville,\r\nand Cossé resisting his appointment. The hostility of the Parisians\r\nto Montmorency, though certainly not the accusation of the cardinal\r\nof Lorraine that the constable’s son had secret intelligence with the\r\nprince of Orange, militated against him. The English ambassador even\r\nbelieved that Montmorency and the duke of Bouillon might appear in arms\r\nfor Condé. Sir Henry Norris to the queen: “On the 23d ult. the duke\r\nof Montmorency required the captains and _échevins_ of Paris to come\r\nto the Louvre to speak with him, and declared that their disorders\r\nand unaptness to be ruled was not unknown to the King.

In it they deplore the sad effects of the\r\npersecutions in France (see _Archives de la maison d’Orange-Nassau_,\r\nII, 99-100, June, 1567). On January 24, 1569, a decree of the elector\r\nof Saxony commanded all captains and soldiers who were his subjects and\r\nwho might be serving under the duke of Alva or the King of France, to\r\nreturn home within two months after the date of the publication of the\r\ndecree; and further ordered his officers to arrest any persons whom\r\nthey might find setting forth for these services.—Dresden, January 24,\r\n1569 (_C. S. P. For._, No. 74). In March, Augustus of Saxony, the count\r\npalatine, and other German princes sent 50,000 silver crowns to Condé\r\n(_ibid._, _Ven._, No. 452, March 15, 1569).\r\n\r\n[1313] William of Orange with his two brothers went into Germany\r\nin order to push the plan in conjunction with the duke of\r\nDeuxponts—D’Aubigné, III, 45, 60 (_C.

The duke of Aumale\r\nhas published some of his letters at this time (_Hist. des princes de\r\nCondé_, II, 406 ff.).\r\n\r\n[1314] D’Aumale at this time lay at Phalsburg and Saverne, with 4,000\r\nreiters, 2,000 French horse, and 10,000 footmen.

The duke remained in Paris, and attended to the\r\nforwarding of powder, provisions, and money. In a letter of November\r\n17, 1569, he writes to Charles IX that it is impossible for him to send\r\nthe sums demanded unless he sells the plate and jewels of the King.\r\nIn another he sends information of the duke of Tuscany, who was ready\r\nto loan 100,000 écus upon the jewels of the crown. He advises that\r\nthis be done. According to his estimate they were worth 500,000 livres\r\n(La Ferrière, _Rapport sur les recherches faites à la Bibliothèque\r\nimperiale de St. Pétersbourg_, 27).\r\n\r\n[1339] Proclamation by Charles IX: Commands all gentlemen and soldiers\r\nto repair to the camp of the duke of Anjou by the 20th of June,\r\nproperly armed and equipped for service.

To support them Paris was mulcted for 700,000 francs and\r\nconfiscation of Protestant lands to the crown eked out the balance\r\n(_ibid._, No. 355, July 29, 1569).\r\n\r\nThe following summary from Sir Henry Norris’ letter to Queen Elizabeth\r\nsets forth the government’s fiscal policy at this time: “On the 1st\r\ninstant the king went to the Palais, where in the end, the Parlement\r\nmade a general arrest of all the goods, lands, and offices of those who\r\nbore arms against the king, and that all their lands held in fee—or\r\nknight-service—should revert to the crown; and that for the other\r\nlands, first there should be alienated for the sum of 50,000 crowns\r\nby the year, and given to the clergy, in recompense of their demesne,\r\nwhich the king had license to sell, and the remainder bestowed on such\r\nas had suffered loss by the religion and done service in these wars.\r\nIt is accounted that this attainture will amount to 2,000,000 francs\r\na year. The same day they made sale, by sound of trumpet, of the\r\nadmiral’s goods in Paris. Some moved to have him executed in effigy,\r\nwhich was thought unmeet, as serving only to irritate him to proceed\r\nthe more extremely. The king borrows 300,000 £ and offers to perpetuate\r\nthe Councillors of Parlement’s offices to their children, on their\r\ngiving a certain sum of money; besides this they tax all citizens\r\nthroughout the realm to make great contributions. The cardinals of\r\nBourbon and Lorraine, to show an example to the clergy, have offered to\r\nsell 4,000 £ rent of the monasteries of St. Germain and St. Denis” (_C.\r\nS. P.

Montluc, V, 211, note, says: “Les documents\r\ninédits sont presque innombrables. Outre les lettres conservées à la\r\nBibliothèque Nationale, principalement dans la collection Harlay, St.\r\nGermain, vol. 323 et suivants, nous citerons, aux archives de Pau la\r\nsérie B 952 à 958: les registres consulaires d’Auch, les registres\r\nde Larcher aux archives de Tarbes, les registres consulaires de\r\nBagnères-de-Bigorre.” The local archives of Bigorre contain many of\r\nMontgomery’s letters. Some of them have been published in _Arch. de la\r\nGascogne_, VI.\r\n\r\n[1406] _Commentaires et lettres de Montluc_, III, 286.\r\n\r\n[1407] _Hist. du Languedoc_, V, 164.\r\n\r\n[1408] Damville ignored the railings of Montluc until November, when\r\nhe wrote to the King in vindication of himself, giving a full account\r\nof their campaign against Montgomery (De Ruble, _Commentaires et\r\nlettres de Montluc_, V, 243-57, notes; Coll. Godefroy, CCLVII, Nos.\r\n75 and 84. The first is printed in _Archives de la Gironde_, II, 148;\r\n_Hist. du Lang._, V, 521, note 2; the latter is given in tome XII,\r\npreuves, note 304). Damville seems to have anticipated an inquiry,\r\nfor he carefully laid aside all of Montluc’s letters from May 26 to\r\nOctober 22, 1569. On February 27, 1570, Damville sent the King a\r\nstinging indictment of Montluc’s course. In it he declared Montluc was\r\na rash impostor and accused him of forcing the people of Guyenne to\r\npay unjust ransoms; of violating women; of misusing public moneys; and\r\nasserted that he courted investigation of his own conduct (De Ruble,\r\n_Montluc_, III, 394; V, 269, and notes; _Hist. du Lang._, V, 529, note\r\n3; the letter was first published by Le Laboureur in the _Additions\r\nto Castelnau_, II, 130, from a copy in the Dupuy Coll., Vol. 755. M.\r\nTamizey de Larroque discovered the original in the Coll. Godefroy in\r\nthe Bib. de l’Institut). Most men of the time, however, deplored the\r\ncontest between these two Catholic chiefs of the south, without taking\r\nsides (see _Archives de la Gironde_, II, 148). Montluc’s Spanish spy,\r\nBardaxi, naturally reproaches Damville (K. 1,574, No. 154). Probably\r\nno judgment may fairly be pronounced until all the sources have been\r\ncarefully examined. A life of Damville is a work sorely needed; it is a\r\nrich subject for some historical student.\r\n\r\nThe recent work of M. Courteault, _Blaise de Montluc_, 538-40, 551-53,\r\n557-59, goes at length into this feud between Montluc and Damville. In\r\nthe main the author sides with the marshal—“Damville acceptait les\r\nfaits accomplis et ne jugeait pas utile de combattre Mongonmery” (p.\r\n551). He declares that “prudemmement, il [Montluc] a passé dans son\r\nlivre ce grave incident sous silence” (p. 551). He admits, however,\r\nthat if the King had ordered an investigation Damville would have had\r\nsomething to answer for (p. 559).\r\n\r\nThere are numerous letters of Charles IX to Montluc in the St.\r\nPetersburg archives. In them Charles harps upon the disagreeable\r\nconduct of Montluc toward Jeanne d’Albret, and tries at one and the\r\nsame time to repress the queen’s indefatigable propaganda lest it anger\r\nSpain, and to restrain Montluc because of his outrageous conduct and\r\nthe illustrious blood of the queen of Navarre (La Ferrière, _Rapport_,\r\n22.) Letters of the marshal Montmorency and of marshal Damville are\r\nalso in this volume. Those of the latter cover the history of all the\r\ncampaigns of Montgomery in Béarn. He condemns Montluc for the death\r\nof Terride. The marshal’s laconic language is strikingly in contrast\r\nwith Montluc’s rhetorical complaint (La Ferrière, _Rapport_, 44). If we\r\nmay believe Brantôme, “dans toutes les guerres Montluc gagna la pièce\r\nd’argent; auparavant il n’avoit pas grandes finances, et se trouva\r\navoir dans ses coffres cent mille escus.” Charles IX once sharply\r\nreminded Montluc in a letter of November, 1562, that he was getting\r\n500 livres per month for his table. (La Ferrière, _Blaise de Montluc\r\nd’après sa correspondance inédite_, Mém. lus à la Sorbonne, 1864.)\r\n\r\n[1409] Coligny was quick to seize the opportunity afforded in the\r\nsouth to continue the war there until the crown came to terms with\r\nthe Huguenots. After the King’s capture of St. Jean-d’Angély, Coligny\r\ncrossed the Loire to join Montgomery (cf. Delaborde. III, 157, 161,\r\n169, 170; _Montluc_, III, 347, October; _C. S. P. For._, No. 577,\r\nDecember, 1569; Letters from La Rochelle to the cardinal of Châtillon).\r\nThe cardinal has received letters from his brother the admiral, dated\r\nfrom Montauban November 22, informing him that the princes are well,\r\nthat their army is increasing, that the reiters are content and\r\nhave received pay, and that there is no difficulty in joining with\r\nMontgomery and the viscounts. Their army will consist of 6,500 horse\r\nand 12,000 arquebusiers. For the proclamation issued from Montauban\r\nsee Appendix XXIII. In _C. S. P. For._, No. 667, January, 1570, is an\r\nextract of a letter from La Rochelle, describing the position of the\r\narmies of the admiral and the count of Montgomery, who are on either\r\nbank of the Garonne, and in good spirits and health.\r\n\r\n[1410] De Ruble, _Commentaires et lettres de Montluc_, V, 263, 264.\r\nLetter of Montluc to Charles IX, January 9, 1570. He writes almost\r\nbroken hearted.\r\n\r\n[1411] So great was the desolation inflicted that the King was obliged\r\nto remit the _taille_ in Agenois (_Arch. municip. d’Agen reg. consul._,\r\nfol. 262). The Protestants were so encouraged that even those living\r\nin Agen, Montluc’s own town, dared to revolt (_Bull. du Com. de la\r\nlangue et de l’hist. de France_, I, 478; _Reg. munic. d’Agen_, fol.\r\n254). An interesting comparison might be made between the rules for the\r\ngovernment of the camp issued by Coligny at this time—they are in K.\r\n1,575, No. 7—and those issued by the prince of Condé at Orleans, in\r\nApril, 1562. For an example of the severe discipline in the Protestant\r\narmy see Claude Haton, II, 568; cf. De Thou, Book XXX.\r\n\r\n[1412] De Ruble, _Commentaires et lettres de Montluc_, III, 74.\r\n\r\n[1413] _Ibid._, 314.\r\n\r\n[1414] De Ruble, _op. cit._, III, 315-29; Montluc’s sang-froid is\r\namazing as he writes.\r\n\r\n[1415] Delaborde, III. 157, 161, 169, 170. Early in 1569 Montluc sent a\r\ncomplaint to Charles IX protesting against this export of grain. This\r\ntrade redounded to the advantage of the commander of the Gascon coast,\r\nwho was a brother of the bishop of Agen, and Montluc’s complaint gave\r\nrise to an acrimonious correspondence preserved in Coll. Harley St.\r\nGermain, No. 323, which throws some light on the interesting question\r\nof trade in the sixteenth century (see _Commentaires et lettres de\r\nMontluc_, III, 395, note).\r\n\r\n[1416] See Montluc’s observations in III, 368, 369. He gives a spirited\r\naccount on p. 367 of an attack of the reiters on Monbrun, describing\r\nthe way they fought in the close quarters of a town.\r\n\r\n[1417] _C. S. P. For._, No. 543, December 19, 1569.\r\n\r\n[1418] Ruble, _Commentaires et lettres de Montluc_, III, 262.\r\n\r\n[1419] He took it long before historians attributed the honor to him\r\n(_ibid._, 382).\r\n\r\n[1420] _Ibid._, 366.\r\n\r\n[1421] “Il devoit considérer l’importance de la place qui estoit sur\r\ndeux rivières.”—_Ibid._\r\n\r\n[1422] _Ibid._, V, 266.\r\n\r\n[1423] All this happened on the night of December 15 and 16\r\n(_Commentaires et lettres de Montluc_, III, 384, 385). De Thou, V, Book\r\nXLV, 666-68, and Popelinière, Book XXII, both tell the tale. A learned\r\ndissertation in _Hist. du Lang._, XII, note 5, clears up a number of\r\nobscure points in these accounts.\r\n\r\n[1424] The last of them got across by January 3, 1570 (_Montluc_, III,\r\n384-91, and his letter of January 9, in V, 261-64).\r\n\r\n[1425] For a description of Blaye see _Rel. vén._, I, 22, 23.\r\n\r\n[1426] For a description of Brouage see _Rel. vén._, I, 27.\r\n\r\n[1427] The sources are unanimous on this point, both Protestant\r\nand Catholic (La Noue, _Disc. polit. et milit._, chap. xxix; La\r\nPopelinière, Book XXII; Montluc, _Comment._, III, 395; Brantôme, ed.\r\nLalanne, IV, 322; _Hist. du Lang._, V, 527-29, note; Delaborde, III,\r\n189). The outrages of the reiters were so great that a special order of\r\nthe day was required to govern their conduct (see K. 1,575, No. 17).\r\n\r\n[1428] During the nine months which elapsed between the battle of\r\nMoncontour and the peace of St. Germain, the Huguenot army marched over\r\n300 leagues.\r\n\r\n[1429] La Popelinière, Book XXII; La Noue, chap. xxix; _Revue hist._,\r\nII, 542, 543.\r\n\r\n[1430] La Noue’s observation on this point is curious; cf. Delaborde,\r\nIII, 205.\r\n\r\n[1431] Cf. Elizabeth’s declarations of neutrality to Norris, (_C.\r\nS. P., For._, No. 704, February 23, 1570). Across the Channel the\r\ncardinal of Châtillon did all he could to secure the support of the\r\nEnglish queen for the Huguenots (_ibid._, No. 742, the cardinal\r\nto Cecil, March 9, 1570; cf. Delaborde, _Coligny_, III, 185); La\r\nFerrière, _Le XVI^[e] siècle et les Valois_, 254-56; and a letter of the\r\ncardinal to the prince of Orange, April 23, 1570, (_Arch. de la maison\r\nd’Orange-Nassau_, III, 373-77). But it was not from England direct, but\r\nfrom Germany, under the stimulus of English gold, that France looked\r\nfor assistance to come to the Huguenots (_C. S. P. Ven._, No. 476,\r\nFebruary 26, 1570).\r\n\r\n[1432] See Appendix XXIV.\r\n\r\n[1433] _State Papers, Foreign_, Elizabeth, Vol. CXII, No. 693 J, the\r\ncardinal of Lorraine to——.

The provinces were required to furnish\r\nthe supplies (_Commentaires et lettres de Montluc_, III, 400). The\r\nconsular registers of Agen and Auch still preserve the records of his\r\nrequisitions. According to the report of a Spanish spy, in K. 1,576,\r\nNo. 5, the forces consisted of 10,000 footmen, 1,500 horse, and 18\r\npieces of artillery. This is surely exaggerated.

To consummate Montluc’s\r\nhumiliation, Charles IX filled his place, without giving him\r\nopportunity to resign, by appointing the marquis de Villars to be his\r\nsuccessor. He did not reach Guyenne until October 22. In the meantime\r\nhis brother, Jean de Montluc, bishop of Valence, and _commissaire des\r\nfinances_ in Guyenne, and as much a Politique as the other was a bigot,\r\nexercised authority for him.

The Pope wrote with mingled\r\nalarm and regret over the Peace of St. Germain to the cardinals of\r\nBourbon and Lorraine, on September 23, 1570 (Potter, _Pie V_, 103, 107,\r\ned. Gouban, Book IV, letter 7, pp. 282, 285).\r\n\r\n[1446] For an excellent discussion of the feudal interests and policy\r\nof the Huguenots in the civil wars, see Weill, _Les théories sur le\r\npouvoir royal en France pendant les guerres de religion_, 73-80.\r\n\r\n[1447] See the letter of the papal nuncio to Philip II, June 26, 1570,\r\nin Appendix XXVI. The Pope had protested even earlier than this (brief\r\nof Pius V to the cardinal of Lorraine, March 2, 1570, disapproving\r\nof the conditions of peace). The King, even if vanquished, ought not\r\nto have consented to such detestable terms. The Pope’s sorrow is\r\nthe greater because of the cardinal’s assent to them (La Ferrière\r\n_Rapport_, 55).\r\n\r\n[1448] In 1562 on account of fear lest the Moriscos might enter into\r\nrelation with the Moors of Africa, the government of Spain forbade the\r\nuse of arms among them. In 1567 an attempt was made to suppress their\r\nlanguage and abolish their national customs. A terrible war ensued. Don\r\nJohn of Austria finally suppressed the revolt after it had lasted for\r\nten years. But in 1570, in anticipation of a Turkish attack from the\r\nwest the Moors again rebelled and Spain had to compromise (_Archives de\r\nla maison d’Orange-Nassau_, III, 361; cf. Lea, _The Moriscos of Spain_).\r\n\r\n[1449] _C. S. P. Ven._, No. 485, July 20, 1570.\r\n\r\n[1450] _Nég. Tosc._, III, 439.\r\n\r\n[1451] “Montmorency bears the vogue in court.”—_C. S. P.

Aside from the fact that France at this juncture was\r\nunwilling to further any cause advocated by Spain, there was too much\r\npractical advantage to France in maintaining the _entente cordiale_\r\nwith the Turks. Turkish influence might be brought to bear upon the\r\nEmperor to neutralize his opposition to French enterprise in Poland;\r\nmoreover, France had but recently concluded an advantageous commercial\r\ntreaty with the Sultan. For accounts of the relations of France and\r\nTurkey at this time see Du Ferrier, _Un ambassadeur liberal sous\r\nCharles IX et Henri III_, 44-102; Flament, “La France et la Ligue\r\ncontre le Turc (1571-73),” _Rev. d’hist. dip._, XVI, 1902, p. 619;\r\nJanssen, _History of the German People_, VIII, chap. v, “Turkish\r\nwars up to 1572.” The league of the Christian powers, whose efforts\r\nculminated in the famous engagement of Lepanto was formed in May, 1571.\r\nThe king of Spain, the Pope and Venice were the principals thereof.\r\nSpain was to provide one-half of the forces, the Venetians one-third,\r\nand the Pope the remainder. The capture of Cyprus by the Turks in the\r\nspring of 1570 was the immediate cause of its formation (cf. _La vraye\r\net très fidelle narration des succès, des assaults, defences et prinse\r\ndu royaume de Cypre_, faicte par F. Ange de Lusignan, Paris 1580;\r\n_Commentari della guerra di Cipro e della lega dei principi cristiani\r\ncontro il Turco_, di Bartolomeo Sereno, 1845; Herre, _Europäische\r\nPolitik in cyprischen Krieg_, 1570-73, Leipzig, 1902—there is a\r\nreview of this in _English Hist. Review_, XIX, 357; Miller, “Greece\r\nunder the Turks 1571-1684,” _English Hist. Review_, XIX, 646). Europe\r\nexpected a double attack on the part of Mohammedanism, both in the\r\nMediterranean and by land against Hungary and Transylvania, as in 1530.\r\nVenice trembled for Zara in Dalmatia. These fears were not misplaced.\r\nThe warlike preparations of the Sultan went so far as to offer pardon\r\nto all malefactors, except rebels and counterfeiters, who would serve\r\nin the galleys. The allied fleet lay at Candia during the winter of\r\n1570-71 awaiting reinforcements. But there was a vast amount of anxiety\r\nand discontent among the allies, for nothing but the sense of a common\r\nperil could have united Venice and Spain, or Venice and the Pope. In\r\nthe politics of Europe Venice was a neutral power, and neutrality in\r\nthe religious politics of the time, in Philip II’s eyes, was almost\r\ntantamount to heresy. Moreover, as was inevitable, the tediousness\r\nof the preparations and the corruption of officials of the fleet was\r\nso great that men even died of hunger inflicted through fraud. Only\r\nVenice’s administration seems to have been efficient.\r\n\r\n[1463] _L’Ambassade de St. Sulpice_, 150.\r\n\r\n[1464] _Négociations dans le Levant_, III, 13.\r\n\r\n[1465] _L’Ambassade de St. Sulpice_, 261, 267.\r\n\r\n[1466] _Dépêches de M.

S. P. For._, No. 496, July 20, 1572;\r\ncf. No. 375, May 25, instructions to the earl of Lincoln).\r\n\r\n[1484] This objection was one so difficult to make without giving\r\noffense that it required all the delicacy of the English envoys to say\r\nanything at all. In _C. S. P. For._, No. 494 under date of July 20,\r\n1572, will be found a draft of instructions to Walsingham in Burghley’s\r\nhandwriting on this matter, and by him endorsed: “Not sent.” Burghley\r\nevidently preferred to leave this delicate subject to his sovereign.\r\nSee the queen to Walsingham, _ibid._, No. 502, July 23, 1572, printed\r\nin full by Digges, p. 226.\r\n\r\n[1485] Smith’s comments to Burghley are candor itself. “These two\r\nbrethren be almost become ‘Capi de Guelphi et Gibellini.’ The one has\r\nhis suite all Papists, the other is the refuge and succour of all the\r\nHuguenots, a good fellow and lusty prince.”—_Ibid._, No. 23, January\r\n9, 1572. He glosses over Alençon’s imperfections by the remark that “he\r\nis not so tall or fair as his brother, but that is as is fantasied,”\r\nand adds: “Then he is not so obstinate, papistical, and restive like a\r\nmule as his brother is.”—_Ibid._, No. 28, January 10, 1572.\r\n\r\n[1486] See below for details of this treaty.

Besides,\r\nif they alter their old settled trade, they would also have to seek\r\nfor dressers and dyers in a place unacquainted with the trade. It is\r\ndangerous to have the vent of all the commodity of the realm in one\r\ncountry, especially seeing the French have small trade to England.\r\nThere is besides such evil observance of treaties and so evil justice\r\nin France. The drapers of France so much mislike the bringing of cloth\r\ninto France that they will not endure it, insomuch as January last, by\r\nproclamation, all foreign cloth was banished. The converting of the\r\nwhole trade of England into France would be hurtful to the navy, for\r\nthat the ports there are so small that no great ship may enter.\r\n\r\nFor the Merchant Adventurers in the sixteenth century see Burgon, _Life\r\nand Times of Sir Thomas Gresham_, I, 185-89.\r\n\r\n[1493] _C.

Lord Buckhurst,\r\nin a letter to Queen Elizabeth of March 4, 1571, gives an account\r\nof one of Charles’ hunting parties in the Bois de Vincennes, which\r\nillustrates his temperament. “After dinner,” he relates, “the King\r\nrode to a warren of hares thereby, and after he had coursed with much\r\npastime, he flew to the partridge with a cast of very good falcons; and\r\nthat done, entered the park of Bois de Vincennes, replenished with some\r\nstore of fallow deer. Understanding that Lord Buckhurst had a leash of\r\ngreyhounds, he sent to him that he might put on his dogs to the deer,\r\nwhich he did, but found that the deer ran better for their lives than\r\nthe dogs did for his pastime. After this the King and all the gentlemen\r\nwith him fell to a new manner of hunting, chasing the whole herd with\r\ntheir drawn swords, on horseback, so far forth as they being embosked\r\nwere easily stricken and slain; they spared no male deer, but killed of\r\nall sorts without respect, like hunters who sought not to requite any\r\npart of their travail with delight to eat of the slain venison.”—_C.\r\nS. P. For._, No. 1,589, March 4, 1571. In the spring of 1573 the\r\nFrench consul in Alexandria sent Charles three trained leopards for\r\ndeer-hunting (Coll. Godefroy, CCLVI, No. 51). In June, 1571, the\r\nKing was somewhat seriously injured while hunting, by striking his\r\nhead against the branch of a tree (_C. S. P. For._, No. 1,777, June\r\n8, 1571). In March, 1572, he again was injured (letter of the King\r\nto the duke of Anjou, March 21, 1572, in Coll. Pichon, No. 28). His\r\npassion for the chase often led him to neglect the business of state,\r\nconduct which Coligny once sharply reproved (_C. S. P. For._, No.\r\n2,156, November 29, 1571), and he was frequently ill from fatigue or\r\nexposure (_L’Ambassade de St. Sulpice_, 301). The King himself inspired\r\nthe French translation of a Latin treatise of the sixteenth century\r\non hunting, by Louis Leroy de Coutances, _Libre du roy Charles_.\r\nHis patronage also inspired another work on the same subject: “Du\r\nFouilloux, La Vénerie de lacques du Fouilloux, Gentilhomme, Seigneur\r\ndudit lieu, pays de Gastine, en Poitou. Dédise au Roy Très-Chrestien\r\nCharles, neufiesme de ce nom. Avec plusieurs Receptes et Remèdes pour\r\nguérir les Chiens de diverses maladies. Avec Privilege du Roy. A\r\nPoitiers, Par les de Marnefz, et Bouchetz, frères, circa 1565.” Charles\r\nIX was also given to low practical jokes. For example this is reported\r\nof him from Paris, September 18, 1573: The King, in an old cloak and\r\nevil-favoured hat, withdrew himself “to a little house upon the bridge\r\nfrom all the ladies, and there cast out money upon the people to get\r\nthem together, and made pastime to cast out buckets of water upon them\r\nwhile they were scrambling for the money.”—_C. S. P. For._, Paris,\r\nSeptember 18, 1573.\r\n\r\n[1500] Walsingham reported to Burghley in August 12, 1571: “This prince\r\nis of far greater judgment than outwardly appears. There is none of any\r\naccount within his realm whose imperfections and virtues he knows not,”\r\nalthough, he adds, “those who love him lament he is so overmuch given\r\nto pleasure.”—_Ibid._, No. 1,921.\r\n\r\n[1501] In May 1571 the Guises were in discredit. The duke went to\r\nJoinville, the cardinal of Lorraine to Rheims, the duke of Mayenne\r\nstarted for Turkey. Guise did not come back to Paris till January 1572\r\n(Bouillé, _Histoire des ducs de Guises_, II, Book IV, chap. iv).\r\n\r\n[1502] “He appeared at all hours near his majesty’s chair upon the same\r\nterms as the lords who had never left the court” (_C. S. P. Ven._, No.\r\n576, September 15, 1570). Coligny first became a member of the _conseil\r\ndu roi_ at this time (Soldan, _Vor d. St. Barthloomäusnacht_, 39).\r\nBlois was practically the capital of France at this time. Paris was\r\navoided both to save creating suspicion among the Huguenots and because\r\nof its Guisard sympathies. “He would change from white to black the\r\nmoment he was in Paris” said Walsingham of the King. Capefigue, _Hist.\r\nde la réforme_, III, 92, points out Blois was “le siège naturel d’un\r\ngouvernement qui voulait s’éloigner du catholocisme fervent. Placé à\r\nquelques lieues d’Orleans, donnant la main à la Rochelle, et par la\r\nRochelle, se liant au Poitou, à la Saintonge, au Béarn.”\r\n\r\n[1503] The King conceives of no other subject better than of the\r\nadmiral, and there is great hope that he will use him in matters of the\r\ngreatest trust, for he begins to see the insufficiency of others, some\r\nbeing more addicted to others than to him, others more Spanish than\r\nFrench, or given more to private pleasures than public affairs (_C. S.\r\nP. For._, No. 1,921, August 12, 1571).\r\n\r\n[1504] Alva to Philip II, April 5, May 22, 1572, in Gachard,\r\n_Correspondance de Philippe II_, II, 239.

The Prince of Orange in 1569 began\r\nthe practice of issuing letters of marque and reprisal in virtue of his\r\nposition as sovereign prince of Orange. As a result in the next year\r\nthe English Channel and the Bay of Biscay were crowded with vessels\r\nhostile to Spain. The most famous of these marauders soon destined to\r\nbecome known as the “Beggars of the Sea” was Adrian de Bergues. On\r\none occasion within the space of two days, he overhauled and captured\r\ntwo merchant fleets, the one of 40, the other of 60 sail (_Arch. de\r\nla maison d’Orange-Nassau_, III, 351). Upon the importance of La\r\nRochelle as a seaport, see La Noue, chap. xxviii. Some of Strozzi’s\r\ncorrespondence when in command of the fleet before La Rochelle in 1572\r\nis in F.

Languet, _Epist. secr._,\r\nI, 177, August 15, 1571. I am inclined to believe that Walsingham\r\ncolored the anecdote. Languet shows the hesitations and vacillations of\r\nCharles IX, pp. 132, 136, 140. The Spanish ambassador’s grounds of fear\r\nfor Flanders were the more substantial because the garrisons that had\r\noccupied St. Jean-d’Angély, Niort, Saintes, and Angoulême during the\r\nlate war were newly stationed in the border fortresses of Picardy. To\r\nAlava’s alarmed inquiry Charles IX blandly replied that “the reason why\r\nthese troops were sent to the frontiers was to give them employment,\r\nbecause if the King had disbanded them all at once the soldiery might\r\nhave mutinied for lack of pay” (_C. S. P. Ven._, No. 499, February 19,\r\n1571; No. 575, August 1, 1571).\r\n\r\n[1511] “The only impediment to the marriage between the prince of\r\nNavarre and the lady Margaret is religion.”—_C. S. P. For._, No.\r\n2,038, Walsingham to Cecil, September 16, 1571. The whole matter was\r\nreferred to eight counselors to settle: those of the Huguenots were\r\nJeanne d’Albret, La Noue, Louis of Nassau, and Francourt (_C. S. P.\r\nFor._, March 29, 1572; _Archives de la maison d’Orange-Nassau_, III,\r\n417). The Pope made objection that, aside from the difference of\r\nreligion, the parents of Henry of Navarre and Marguerite of Valois\r\nwere relatives within the third degree, and refused to grant the\r\ndispensation for the marriage (_Nég. Tosc._, III, 712-14). To this\r\ndemur the Huguenots triumphantly argued that it was not necessary for\r\nthe Pope or any other priest to give dispensation, since it was a\r\n_royal_ marriage and it was not fitting for the King’s authority to\r\nbe demeaned by that of the church (Claude Haton, II, 661). There was\r\nviolent opposition by radical Huguenots, especially the pastors, to\r\nthe marriage, and fear lest the Pope’s refusal to grant a dispensation\r\nmight lead to a rupture between France and Rome like that of England\r\nunder Henry VIII (_Nég.

Finally it was\r\narranged that the marriage should be celebrated by a priest of the\r\nchurch of Rome, and that Henry would accompany his wife to mass in the\r\nchurch where the ceremony was to be held, but that he was to retire\r\nbefore the service so that he was neither to be present at the mass\r\nnor hear it said (_ibid._, 662 and note, 663, note). The cardinal\r\nof Lorraine, with his usual “trimming” wrote to the queen mother:\r\n“Madame, je vous baise très humblement les mains de ce qu’il vous\r\nplaît me mander la conclusion du marriage de madame vostre fille,\r\npuisqu’il est au contentement de vos majestés et selon les désirs des\r\ncatholiques.”—_Collection des autographes_, No. 278, April 17, 1572.\r\n\r\nFor the preliminaries of the marriage of Marguerite of Valois and Henry\r\nof Navarre see _Revue des deux mondes_, October 1, 1884, pp. 560-64.\r\n\r\n[1512] _C. S. P. Ven._, No. 516; August 15, 1571. Spain and France\r\nclashed in Switzerland, too, at this time. For Switzerland refused\r\nto permit forces to fight the Turk on the ground that the Swiss were\r\nunused to maritime warfare, yet the Grisons and the Tyrol raised two\r\nregiments for the French King (_ibid._, _For._, No. 189, March 25,\r\n1572, from Heidelberg or Strasburg).\r\n\r\n[1513] “There have been no other speeches but war with\r\nSpain.”—Killegrew to Lord Burghley, December 8, 1571; _C. S. P. For._,\r\nNo. 2,163; cf. _Nég. Tosc._, III, dispatches of April 17 and 20, 1572\r\nand _C. S. P. For._, Nos. 2,156, 2,162, November 29, December 7, 1571.\r\nAlva fully expected war (Gachard, _Correspondance de Philippe II sur\r\nles Pays-Bas_, II, 259, Alva to Philip II, May 24, 1572).\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1572 Schomberg was dispatched to Germany to\r\ncontract alliances with the Lutheran princes (_Arch. de la maison\r\nd’Orange-Nassau_, III, 403; _C. S. P. For._, No. 189, March 25, 1572).\r\nThe German princes anticipated that if the Low Countries were united to\r\nthe crown of France that power would become too formidable. They wanted\r\nFrance to content herself with Flanders and Artois. As for Brabant\r\nand the other provinces that were once dependent upon the empire,\r\ntheir purpose was to put them upon their old footing and to give the\r\ngovernment of them to some prince of Germany, who could not be other\r\nthan the prince of Orange. Holland and Zealand were to be united to\r\nthe crown of England (Walsingham, 143, French ed., letter of August\r\n12, 1572 to Leicester). Yet momentous as the French project in the Low\r\nCountries was, it was but part of a grander scheme, for France aimed\r\nalso to acquire a decisive influence in Germany, with the ultimate\r\npurpose of acquiring so great ascendency over the German states as to\r\nbe able to transfer the crown of the empire, for centuries hereditary\r\nin the house of Hapsburg, to the head of the French prince (_Rel.\r\nvén._, I, 445). This project was part of the mission of Schomberg\r\nin Germany (_Arch. de la maison d’Orange-Nassau_, IV, Introd., 23,\r\n268-73). In Germany the elector of Saxony and the landgrave of Hesse\r\nwere strong partisans of France (_ibid._, IV, Introd., 25).\r\n\r\nThe strongest advocate of France for the imperial crown was the elector\r\npalatine, who burned with an ambition to “Calvinize the world,” and\r\nembraced with ardor a project which could not fail to redound to the\r\nhonor of the Huguenots. The elector of Saxony and the landgrave were\r\nless complacent. The first was a friend of the emperor Maximilian and\r\nexpressed his indignation at the imperial pretensions of Charles IX.\r\nEven William of Hesse, in spite of his hereditary attachment to the\r\ncrown of France, returned a guarded reply (_ibid._, IV, Introd., 28 and\r\n123).\r\n\r\n[1514] The revolt took place on Easter Sunday, April 6, 1572. On\r\nthe whole subject of the revolt of the Netherlands at this time see\r\nJanssen, _History of the German People_, VIII, chap. ii; La Gravière,\r\n“Les Gueux de Mer,” _Revue des deux mondes_, September 15, 1891, p.\r\n347; November, 1891, p. 98; January 15, 1892, p. 389.\r\n\r\n[1515] See the letter of President Viglius to Hopper in _Arch. de la\r\nmaison d’Orange-Nassau_, III, 415, and _C.

De Frixa and Montmorency were sent to England to ratify the\r\ntreaty. A full account of the gorgeous reception of Montmorency will be\r\nfound in Holinshed and the Account Book of the Master of the Revels.\r\nThe earl of Lincoln left for France, May 26, 1572.

Yet Alva refused to give up (_Archives\r\nde la maison d’Orange-Nassau_, III, 437).\r\n\r\n[1531] The march of the Spanish army that intercepted Genlis was\r\nso accurate as to give rise to the belief that Alva had prior\r\ninformation. It is uncertain. Mendoza, who was with the Spanish army\r\n(_Commentaires_, Book VI, chap. vii) seems to confirm the suspicion.\r\nHis account (chaps. vii-xiii) is very vivid. Only thirty of Genlis’\r\nmen escaped; the rest were either killed or drowned. On the warnings\r\ngiven to Genlis, see a relation in _Archives curieuses_, VII. There is\r\nan unpublished account of Genlis’ defeat in F. Fr., 18,587, fol. 541.\r\nAccording to La Huguerye, 125, he was strangled in prison.\r\n\r\n[1532] It did so on September 19. See a letter of William of Orange\r\nto his brother John, September 24, 1572, in _Archives de la maison\r\nd’Orange-Nassau_, III, 511. La Noue prophesied the fall of the city\r\nwhen he saw the heights of Jemappes occupied by the troops of Spain\r\n(Hauser, _La Noue_, 33).\r\n\r\n[1533] As late as August 11, 1572, the Prince of Orange was still\r\nlooking for the coming of the admiral Coligny into the Low Countries\r\n(see a letter of his to his brother John, of this date in _Archives de\r\nla maison d’Orange-Nassau_, III, 490).\r\n\r\n[1534] Albornoz to secretary of state Cayas, from Brussels, July 19,\r\n1572 (see Gachard, _Correspondance de Philippe II sur les Pays-Bas_,\r\nII, 269). A note of M. Gachard adds: “Cette lettre, datée de St.\r\nLeger, le 27 avril 1572, était écrite par Charles IX au comte Louis de\r\nNassau. Il y disait qu’il était déterminé, autant que les occasions et\r\nla disposition de ses affaires le permettraient à employer les forces\r\nque Dieu avait mises en sa main à tirer les Pays-Bas de l’oppression\r\nsous laquelle ils gémissaient. Une traduction espagnole de cette lettre\r\nexiste aux Archives de Simancas, _papeles de Estado_, liasse 551.”\r\nCharles IX. repudiated its authenticity (see a letter to Mondoucet,\r\nFrench agent in Flanders, dated August 12, 1572, in _Bulletin de la\r\nCommission d’hist. de Belgique_, séries II, IV, 342). The admiral\r\nColigny, without knowing of the incriminating evidence in Alva’s hands\r\nafter the failure before Mons, urged Charles IX to declare war upon\r\nSpain at once as the shortest and safest way out of the difficulty\r\n(Brantôme, _Vie des grandes capitaines françois_—M’l’admiral de\r\nChâtillon).\r\n\r\n[1535] As late as August 21, France had the hardihood to protest her\r\ninnocence of any enterprise in Flanders (Gachard, _Correspondance de\r\nPhilippe II sur les Pays-Bas_, II, 271, Philip to Alva, August 2, 1572;\r\n_ibid._, II, 273, Alva to Philip, August 21, 1572).\r\n\r\n[1536] There is in existence the record of an extremely curious\r\nconversation of the admiral Coligny upon this subject with Henry\r\nMiddelmore, one of the English agents in France, in which the latter\r\nfrankly said: “Of all other thinges we colde least lyke that France\r\nshulde commaunde Flawnders, or bryng it under theyr obedience, for\r\ntherein we dyd see so apparawntlye the greatnes of our dainger, and\r\ntherefore in no wyse colde suffer it.”—Ellis, _Original Letters_, 2d\r\nseries, III, 6. I find the same thought expressed in a letter of Thomas\r\nParker to one Hogyns, written from Bruges, June 17, 1572. See Appendix\r\nXXIX.\r\n\r\n[1537] On this last phase see _Correspondance de Catherine de Médicis_,\r\nIV, Introd., xlix ff., and Froude, _Hist. of England_, X, 312.\r\n\r\n[1538] For a particular account see Whitehead, _Gaspard de Coligny,\r\nAdmiral of France_, 257-64. Two of Lord Burghley’s correspondents give\r\naccounts (_C. S. P. For._, Nos. 537, 538, August 22, 1572). See also an\r\ninteresting extract from the registers of the Bureau of the Ville of\r\nParis in _Archives curieuses_, VII, 211.\r\n\r\n[1539] For the order of Marcel, provost of the merchants, immediately\r\nbefore the massacre, see _Arch. cur._, VII, 212. On the council\r\nof August 24, see Cavalli, 85. Charles IX at first denied any\r\nresponsibility and blamed the Guises. When this proved a dangerous\r\nexplanation, he asserted the massacre was made to foil a similar plot\r\non the part of the Huguenots.\r\n\r\n[1540] At Blois not only the Huguenots were not mistreated but the city\r\nbecame a city of refuge (D’Aubigné, III, 344, note 6). The Mayor of\r\nNantes refused to carry out the orders for massacre (_Bulletin de la\r\nSoc. du prot. franç._, I, 59). Hotman was saved from the massacre at\r\nBourges by his students; on the massacre at Troyes see the relation in\r\n_Arch. cur._, VII, 287; and for that at Lyons an article by Puyroche\r\nin _Bulletin de la Soc. du prot. franç._, XVIII, 305, 353, 401; for\r\nNormandy, _ibid._, VI, 461; _Revue retrospective_, XII, 142 (Lisieux);\r\non the massacre at Rouen, Floquet, _Hist. du parlement de Normandie_,\r\nIII, 126 ff.; on the massacre at Bordeaux see _Arch. de la Gironde_,\r\nVIII, 337. De Thou, Book LIII, says there were 264 victims. On the\r\nmassacre at Toulouse see _Bull. de la Soc. du prot. franç._, August\r\n15, 1886; _Hist. du Languedoc_, V, 639. On the non-execution of the\r\nmassacre in Burgundy see _Bull. de la Soc. du prot. franç._, IV, 164,\r\nand XIV, 340 (documents). The reason for this leniency was the nearness\r\nof Burgundy to the frontier.\r\n\r\n[1541] The contemporary literature on the massacre is given by M.\r\nFelix Bourquelot, editor of the _Mém. de Claude Haton_ in a long note\r\nin II, 673-76. Summarized, these opinions are the following: 1. The\r\nmassacre was done in order to avert a massacre by the Huguenots, after\r\nthe wounding of Coligny. This was the belief of Marguerite of Navarre\r\n(_Mémoires_, ed. Guessard, 264).\r\n\r\n2. The massacre was premeditated by Charles IX and his mother from the\r\ntime of the Bayonne conference.\r\n\r\n3. The massacre was intended to be a military stroke, the government\r\npreferring to attempt their overthrow in this way rather than by battle\r\non the open field.\r\n\r\nSalviati, the papal nuncio, who ought to have known, explicitly denies\r\nthe rumor that a conspiracy was on foot by the Huguenots. In a dispatch\r\nof September 2 (I quote the French translation of Chateaubriand who\r\ncopied them for the Paris archives) he says: “Cela n’en demeurera pas\r\nmoins faux en tous points, et ce sera une honte pour qui est à même de\r\nconnaître quelques choses aux affaires de ce monde de le croire.” In\r\nreply to the Pope’s urgency to extirpate the Protestants, he wrote on\r\nSeptember 22: “Je lui fis part de la très grand consolation qu’avaient\r\nprocuré au Saint Père les succès obtenus dans ce royaume par une\r\ngrace singulière de Dieu, accordée à toute la Chrétienté sous son\r\npontificat. Je fis connaître le désir qu’avait sa Sainteté, de voir\r\npour la plus grande gloire de Dieu, et le plus grand bien de France,\r\ntous les hérétiques extirpés du royaume, et j’ajoutai que dans cette\r\nvue le Saint Père estimait que très à propos que l’on revoqua l’édit\r\nde pacification.” On October 11th, he writes: “Le Saint Père, ai je\r\ndit en éprouve une joie infinie, et a ressenti une grande consolation\r\nd’apprendre que sa Majesté avait commandé d’écrire qu’elle espérait\r\nqu’avant peu la France n’aurait plus d’Huguenots.” Cardinal Orsini, who\r\nwas dispatched as legate from Rome to congratulate Charles IX and to\r\nsupport the exhortations of Salviati, describes his audience with the\r\nKing on December 19. Orsini assured the King that he had eclipsed the\r\nglory of all his house, but urged him to fulfil his promise that not\r\na single Huguenot should be left alive in France: “Se si rigardavva\r\nall’objetto della gloria, non potendo niun fatto de suoi antecessori,\r\nse rettamente si giudicava, agguagliarsi al glorioso ac veramente\r\nincomparabili di sua Maesta, in liberar con tanta prudentia et pietà\r\nin un giorno solo il suo regno da cotanta diabolica peste.... Esortai\r\n... che con essendo servitio ni di Dio, ni di sua Maesta, lasciar\r\nfargli nuovo piede a questa maladetta setta, volesse applicare tutto\r\nil suo pensiero e tutte le forze sue per istirparla affatto, recandosi\r\na memoria quelle che ella haveva fatto scrivere a sua Santità da\r\nMonsignor il Nuntio, che infra pochi giorni non sarebbe pi un ugonotto\r\nin tutto il suo regno.”—Bibliothèque Nationale, MSS Ital., 1,272. The\r\nPope proclaimed a jubilee in honor of the massacre.\r\n\r\nSubjoined is a list of the leading authors and articles upon this\r\nsubject.

They remind her\r\nalso of the evil done by Herod in keeping his rash oath. She ought not\r\ntherefore to keep the league with those who wish to exterminate her\r\npeople in Guyenne, which belongs to her, and whose arms she bears.

The instrument of government contained 89\r\narticles.\r\n\r\n[1572] _C. S. P. For._, Nos. 972, 986, March 20 and 30, 1573. The\r\ncollection of these forced loans was expedited by the presence of\r\nStrozzi’s men-at-arms and the Scotch Guard in the Louvre; and two bands\r\nof Swiss at St. Cloud. In this way, Charles IX was able to collect\r\nthe money “without danger of commotion,” and avoided that worst of\r\nexpedients to the crown, the States-General (see particulars in Dr.\r\nDale’s letter to Burghley of January 11, 1573, _ibid._, No. 1,291).\r\nIn June the assembly of the clergy agreed to furnish the queen mother\r\n200,000 livres and within three years to redeem 1,800,000 livres’\r\nworth of the King’s debts. The clergy made a great stroke by obtaining\r\nthe creation of four receivers-general for the collection of these\r\nsubsidies, the appointments to which they sold for between 600,000\r\nand 700,000 livres, thus saving themselves that amount in the final\r\n(_ibid._, No. 1,027, June 9, 1573). But this relief came too late\r\nfor the government to continue the prosecution of the war before La\r\nRochelle. The capitulation with the Rochellois was too far advanced to\r\nbe withdrawn. Moreover, the crown itself was anxious to close the war.\r\n\r\n[1573] Catherine de Medici to Schomberg, September 13, 1572, _Arch. de\r\nla maison d’Orange-Nassau_, IV, Appendix, No. 13; Weill, 86; _Revue\r\nretrospective_, V, 363.\r\n\r\n[1574] _Nég. Tosc._, III, 876. On July 7 the Tuscan ambassador wrote:\r\n“E, se questo regno si liberassi delle guerre civili, saria facil cosa\r\nla rompessi con Spagna; chè questo, credo, sia il fine di tutti li\r\ntrattamenti che fa Orange in questo regno.”—_Ibid._, 883.\r\n\r\n[1575] _Ibid._, IV, 108, 109.\r\n\r\n[1576] In the same month William of Orange dispatched to France the\r\nSeigneur de Lumbres, whose popularity with the King was so great that\r\nhe even offered to take him into his service (_Archives de la maison\r\nd’Orange-Nassau_, Introd., p. 21, and p. 165), and another agent with\r\ninstructions to treat with the King and the queen mother (_ibid._,\r\nIV, 119-24, May, 1573). William stipulated for the preservation of\r\nthe rights and privileges of whatever provinces and towns might be\r\nconquered by France, and that in case of open war by France upon Spain,\r\nin lieu of an annual subsidy of 400,000 florins, France should give\r\nassistance with men and ships of war, besides the sum mentioned, to\r\nbe paid within two years after the conclusion of peace (_ibid._, IV,\r\n116-19; cf. the prince of Orange to Louis of Nassau upon the proposed\r\nFrench alliance, June 17, 1573).\r\n\r\n[1577] _Ibid._, IV, 33. On May 15, 1573, the prince of Orange concluded\r\na treaty with England, permitting the English to enter the Scheldt\r\nin return for which the prince was to be permitted to purchase\r\narms and ammunition and powder in England (_Archives de la maison\r\nd’Orange-Nassau_, IV, 94).

Schomberg and Louis of Nassau drew up the articles of the proposed\r\ntreaty. In Appendix 44 will be found the articles as originally drawn\r\nup, and on p. 116 the modified form of them as they were changed by\r\nthe prince of Orange. The most important change is that whereby the\r\nprince altered the word “subjection” as applied to the Netherlands to\r\n“protectorate.” The further idea is expressed that these negotiations\r\nwould be fruitless unless the Edict of Pacification were established\r\nwith full force in France (_ibid._, IV, 270, 271).

Louis of Nassau’s letter to his brother\r\non the subject in _Archives de la maison d’Orange-Nassau_, IV, 278\r\nff.). Charles IX was ill at the time and the queen mother went alone\r\nto Blamont (_ibid._, IV, 276, 277; _Mém. du duc de Bouillon_). The\r\nSpanish ambassador in France was not unobservant of the favorable\r\npolicy of Charles toward the Netherlands and so informed the duke of\r\nAlva (_Archives de la maison d’Orange-Nassau_, IV, 132). The peace\r\nof La Rochelle was a hard blow to Spain (Languet, _Epist. secr._, I,\r\n201; St. Goard to Charles IX, July 17, 1573 in _Archives de la maison\r\nd’Orange-Nassau_, IV, 164-69). These negotiations of the prince of\r\nOrange and his brother with England and France, however, came too late\r\nto save Haarlem. On July 12 the unhappy city succumbed. On the 14th the\r\nSpaniards entered and began a regular massacre, in which nearly 1,800\r\npersons were either slain with the sword, hanged, or drowned (_ibid._,\r\nIV, 173; cf. a letter of the prince of Orange to Louis of Nassau,\r\ngiving details of the surrender on July 22, 1573, _ibid._, 175).\r\n\r\n[1581] _C.

The news of the duke of Anjou’s success was\r\nnaturally received with greater pleasure in Paris than anywhere else in\r\nEurope. Bonfires were lighted and the _Te Deum_ sung in honor of his\r\nelection (_C. S. P. For._, No. 1,027, June 9, 1573). The clergy, in the\r\nassembly of the clergy which took place soon after the news arrived,\r\nvoted the duke a subsidy of 300,000 crowns (_ibid._, No. 992).\r\n\r\n[1585] Claude Haton, II, 734; _Nég.

The duke was also afraid to go to Poland by way of\r\nGermany, fearing to get into difficulties on account of the massacre\r\nof St. Bartholomew, which still vividly angered the Protestant\r\nprinces (_ibid._, IV, Introd., p. xxvi, and pp. 15, 19, 26, 32). His\r\nfirst thought was to go by way of Venice and Ragusa, through Servia,\r\nBulgaria, and Moldavia (Languet, _Epist. secr._, I, 197; _Archives\r\nde la maison d’Orange-Nassau_, IV, 168, note). The advantage of the\r\nancient alliance between France and Venice at this time would have\r\nbeen great. There was also some thought of his going entirely by sea,\r\nand the good offices of England were invoked to protect his journey\r\n(Castelnau, ed. Le Laboureur, III, 345). The young prince of Condé had\r\nbeen invited to go along, but excused himself on the ground that he was\r\nafraid of being arrested for his father’s debts, “being a marvellously\r\ngreat sum.”—_C.

The intense Catholic prejudices of the duke of Anjou,\r\nnow king of Poland, were a serious bar to the progress of Schomberg’s\r\nnegotiations in Germany. He warned the duke not to give the impression\r\nof Spanish leanings (Schomberg to the duke of Anjou, October 9, 1572,\r\n_ibid._, IV, Appendix, No. 18), and seems almost to have persuaded him\r\nto abandon his intense Catholic-Spanish predilection (_ibid._, pp. 15,\r\n268). The duke of Anjou is even said to have given Schomberg 100,000\r\nfrancs.

He was not scarred by the pox but he lost flesh\r\nalarmingly by reason of the illness and never recovered his health, and\r\npassed into quick consumption (cf. _C. S. P.

On May 29 the chief\r\nof the Huguenots, or rather, Montgomery, wrote to Lord Burghley from\r\nCarentan, justifying the taking up arms, and stating what need there is\r\nof the favor and protection of the Queen (_ibid._, _For._, No. 1,429,\r\nMay 24, 1574).\r\n\r\n[1620] Weill, 128, 129.\r\n\r\n[1621] _Mém. du duc de Bouillon_, 89.

She feared the\r\nresult if the interview were unsuccessful; she would not allow a public\r\nvisit under any circumstances, and did not wish a private. The recent\r\nexpedition against La Rochelle had also angered her subjects, so that\r\nnow the negotiations were once more apparently at a standstill. But we\r\nmust not forget her private scheme. Nothing could be more in line with\r\nElizabeth’s policy than to promote a family quarrel in the French royal\r\nhouse. That she was well informed of the plot can scarcely be doubted,\r\nfor March 16, 1574, we find a safe-conduct for Alençon in the foreign\r\npapers; and the permission given for him to come to the Queen as soon\r\nas he has notified her of his arrival in England. April 1, moreover,\r\nDale wrote to Walsingham, “The Duke has hope in the Queen and feareth\r\nmuch”—there is nothing more to explain the reference. Hume does not\r\nexplicitly state Elizabeth’s connivance and the editor of Hall, Vol.\r\nII, does not mention the plot at all (p. xxi); neither does Burlingham\r\nin his résumé. It can scarcely be doubted, however, that Elizabeth was\r\nactively interested or, at least, informed of its progress.\r\n\r\n[1632] _Mém. de madame Mornay_, 74, 75.\r\n\r\n[1633] De Thou, Book LVII; _Arch. cur._, VII, 105.\r\n\r\n[1634] _C.

On the entire\r\nmatter see De Crue, “La Molle et Coconat et les négociations du parti\r\ndes Politiques,” _Rev. d’hist. dip._, VI, 1892, p. 375.\r\n\r\n[1641] _Arch. cur._, VIII, 127 ff. Among other charges, La Mole\r\nwas accused of practicing sorcery—“that there should be an image\r\nof wax and a strange medal in the chamber of La Mole for some\r\nenchantment.”—_C. S. P. For._, No. 1,398, Dr. Dale to Burghley, April\r\n27, 1574.\r\n\r\n[1642] _Ibid._, April 22, 1574; No. 1,398, April 27, 1574.\r\n\r\n[1643] _Ibid._, _Ven._, No. 586, May 2, 1574.\r\n\r\n[1644] _Ibid._, and _ibid._, _For._, No. 1,401, Dale to Burghley, April\r\n30, 1574. The whole process was a mockery of justice. According to\r\nanother report the King promised “that he would write to the Parlement\r\nto delay the proceedings. But the bearer of the letters, on arriving\r\nat Paris found the Porte St. Antoine closed. The execution was so much\r\nhurried that in a moment they were both executed. It is said this was\r\ndone by reason of a perfumer relating to the first President what\r\nhad passed in Court, and that the Queen Mother had obtained their\r\npardon. For which cause they were made to come more quickly from the\r\nConciergerie, the carriage made to journey hastily, and directly they\r\narrived at the place of execution they were executed without the usual\r\nproclamations.”—_C. S. P. For._, No 1,403, May 2, 1574.\r\n\r\n[1645] Claude Haton, II, 765.\r\n\r\n[1646] _C. S. P. Ven._, No. 584, April 19, 1574. Both Henry of Navarre\r\nand his fellow-prisoner seemed to have believed in these days that if\r\nCharles IX should die their own expectation of living would be slender,\r\nand their only hope be in corrupting the guard. But they were without\r\nmoney. This is the purport of a cipher dispatch, dated May 22, from\r\nParis and sent to Burghley to be deciphered by him personally. This he\r\nactually did, for the draft is in his handwriting (_ibid._, _For._,\r\nNo. 1,422, 1574; cf. No. 1,431). His reply—to Walsingham—was sent\r\nthree days later (by a slip of the pen he has, however, written “March”\r\ninstead of May).\r\n\r\n[1647] _C. S. P.

Godefroy,\r\nCCLVI, No. 92. Elizabeth seems to have interested herself very much\r\nin their fate and sent Thomas Leighton to France in their behalf.\r\nThe face of affairs thus was changed, for to give some credibility\r\nto her stories of a happy family, Catherine had to allow the princes\r\nmore liberty. Besides, Leighton was captain of Guernsey, and could be\r\nof great assistance to Montgomery so that he had to be well treated\r\nand his desires gratified. The Guises, however, were gaining great\r\ninfluence in court again and in event of the King’s death, Alençon\r\nexpected the Bastille. To escape this he desired money from Elizabeth\r\nto bribe his guards and Burghley actually recommended that this course\r\nbe followed. De Thoré, the youngest of the constable’s sons, fled\r\nto Cassel for safety (Claude Haton, II, 763 and note). The fury of\r\nthe Guises pursued him even in Germany (see a letter of one Davis\r\nto count John of Nassau, June 7, 1574, in _Archives de la maison\r\nd’Orange-Nassau_, IV, 19, giving some particulars on this head, and one\r\nof Schomberg to the same, August 28, at p. 49).\r\n\r\n[1648] See _C. S. P. For._, No. 1,417, May 17, 1574; _Hist. du Lang._,\r\nV, 520, note 1.\r\n\r\n[1649] Yesterday he was more ill-at-ease than ordinarily, and no one\r\nentered his room, but at sunrise several gentlemen and priests came\r\nin. The priests performed the service, at which the queen mother\r\nwas present. He has been of better countenance since hearing of the\r\nexecution of De la Mole and Coconnas, and said he hoped to live to see\r\nthe end of all his conspirators (_C. S. P. For._, No. 1,403, May 2,\r\n1574). Early in April, two couriers were dispatched to Poland to warn\r\nHenry of Anjou to be ready for any emergency (_ibid._, _Ven._, No. 590,\r\nMay 2, 1574). Dr. Dale, the English ambassador, reports, under date of\r\nMay 22: “On the 22d the King fell suddenly sick. The audience appointed\r\nwith the ambassador of the duke of Florence was countermanded, the\r\nbest physicians sent for, and the opinion is that the King is in great\r\ndanger. The falling down of blood into his lungs is come to him again,\r\nand the physicians gave their opinion that if it should happen again\r\nthey could not assure him of any hope.

The Venetian ambassador,\r\nhowever, conjectured that there was more of policy than of revenge\r\nin the act. “It was certainly more to please the Parisians from whom\r\nshe hoped to have efficient aid than for any other reason that she\r\nhad Montgomery put to death.”—_C.

Ils se rassemblèrent en un corps considérable pour piller et\r\nbrûler les châteaux, et exterminer les gentilshommes.

They were dissatisfied that he assumed the title of King\r\nof France without consulting them, and wanted him to govern his new\r\nkingdom through ministers chosen from among them, and to employ himself\r\nin military exploits against the Tartars and Turks (Languet, _Epist.\r\nsecr._, I, 121).\r\n\r\n[1664] Frémy, _Un ambassadeur liberal sous Charles IX et Henri III_,\r\n232.\r\n\r\n[1665] _C.

In consequence, when\r\nCatherine started to meet her son at Lyons, leaving the government of\r\nParis in care of the Parlement (_ibid._, No. 1,509, July 10, 1574), the\r\nyoung princes traveled in the coach with her. “Her chickens go in coach\r\nunder her wing, and so she minds to bring them to the King.”—_Ibid._,\r\n_For._, No. 1,511, Dale to Walsingham, August 9, 1574.\r\n\r\n[1667] _Ibid._, No. 1,537, Dale to Sir Thomas Smith and Francis\r\nWalsingham, September 2, 1574, from Lyons.\r\n\r\n[1668] See the striking comments of the Venetian ambassador, _Rel.\r\nvén._, II, 245, 246.\r\n\r\n[1669] _Rel. vén._, II, 245, 246.\r\n\r\n[1670] _C.

There were 6,500 Swiss at Châlons\r\n(_ibid._, No. 1, 537, September 2, 1574). Henry III had sent orders in\r\nadvance of his coming, commanding that on the 30th of August all the\r\ncompanies of ordinance should retire in garrison and await the orders\r\nof the provincial governors. Troops were levied in Picardy, Champagne,\r\nBrie, Burgundy, and Lorraine, to prevent the Protestant reiters from\r\ngaining entrance into the country and were put under the command of the\r\nduke of Guise, Vaudemont, and the marshal Strozzi (Claude Haton, II,\r\n779).\r\n\r\n[1671] _C.

The headquarters\r\nof the Catholic forces were between Dijon and Langres, but troops\r\npatrolled the whole course of the Marne and extended westward to Sens.\r\nArtillery was sent up the Seine from Paris.

Dr. Dale thought that the project was to connive\r\nat a Turkish attack in Germany for the purpose of embarrassing the\r\nCatholic princes there (_ibid._, No. 1,620, December 23, 1574).\r\n\r\n[1680] The plot was an old one and long in preparation. See a letter\r\nof St. Goard to the King, May 20, 1573 (_Archives de la maison\r\nd’Orange-Nassau_, IV, Appendix, No. 59). The Spanish had been advised\r\nby word from Besançon, on April 3, that those of Geneva and Bern had\r\nconfederated with the Lutheran cantons and secured the favor of the\r\nduke John Casimir, whose purpose was to overcome Besançon and the free\r\ncounty of Burgundy (cf. letter of De Grantyre, the French agent in the\r\nGrisons, to Bellièvre, April 8, 1573, Coll. Godefroy, CCLVIII, No.\r\n52, and the letter of Charles IX to Bellièvre, May 9, 1573, _ibid._,\r\nNo. 55). The author of the plan was a Dr. Butterich, councilor of the\r\nelector (_Archives de la maison d’Orange-Nassau_, V, 89, 99, 101, 107,\r\n120-3). The Swiss cantons were also appealed to, but Beza hesitated\r\n(_ibid._, 111). Spain had secret information of the plot (_ibid._, 89).\r\nIt finally failed (see a letter of Butterich to John of Nassau, June 6,\r\n1575, _ibid._, 214; cf. Languet, _Epist. secr._, I, Part II, 106, July\r\n11, 1575).\r\n\r\n[1681] An example of eccentric partisanship is afforded by the duke\r\nd’Uzes, who was a Huguenot, but who for enmity toward Damville joined\r\nthe King. Henry III made him a marshal and left him in chief command\r\nwhen he went to Rheims (_C. S. P. For._, No. 1,617, December 23, 1574;\r\nNo. 13, January 16, 1575). Bellegarde was also made marshal in this\r\nyear (_ibid._, No. 1,570, September 29, 1574).\r\n\r\n[1682] “Seminario della guerra.”—_Rel. vén._, II, 230.\r\n\r\n[1683] Claude Haton, I, 782, 783.\r\n\r\n[1684] See the luminous _Relazione del Giovanni Michel_, the Venetian\r\nambassador in France in 1575, ed.

Gachard has\r\nparaphrased the letter.\r\n\r\n[1687] “La longa continuazione della guerra, che tutti li paesani\r\nche prima erano disarmati e vilissimi, tutti dati all’arte del campo\r\ne all’agricoltura, ovvero ad alcuna delle arti mecaniche, adesso\r\nsono tutti armati, e talmente essercitati e agguerriti che non si\r\ndistinguono dalli più veterani soldati; tutti fatti archibugieri\r\neccellentissimi.”—“Relazione del Giovanni Michel,” _Rel. vén._,\r\nII, 232; cf. Long, 167: “Des violences et des outrages exercés par\r\nquelques petits gentilhommes sur des paysans excitèrent la vengeance\r\ndes villageois voisins, qui, furieux, accoururent en grand nombre.

Les\r\ndefenseurs de la cause commune vont se lever.”\r\n\r\n[1688] The English ambassador gives particulars of the cardinal’s\r\ndeath. “The King would needs go in procession with the Battus, who\r\nare men that whip themselves as they go as a sort of penance. The\r\ncardinal went in this solemn procession well-nigh all the night, and\r\nthe next day he said mass for a solemnity, wherewith he took a great\r\ncold and a continual fever which brought him into a frenzy, wherein he\r\ncontinued divers days. A Jew took upon him to work wonders and gave\r\nhim a medicine whereby he came to his remembrance for a time. Upon the\r\nmedicine there did break out certain pustules or spots in his body like\r\nthe pourpres, whereby some would say he was poisoned. Shortly after he\r\nfell into his old frenzy and so died, the 18th day after he first fell\r\nsick.”—_C. S. P. For._, No. 1,624, December, 1574.\r\n\r\n[1689] _Ibid._, No. 58, March 23, 1575.

In Arch. nat., K.\r\n1537, No. 22, is the report of a Spanish spy, written from Calais on\r\nMarch 18, 1575, which confirms the suspicion of English tampering in\r\nFrance. Printed in Appendix XXXVI.\r\n\r\n[1711] Schomberg’s observations were absolutely just, for on July 23,\r\n1575, at Heidelberg, an instrument was signed by Charles Frederick, the\r\nelector palatine, Henry, prince of Condé, and Charles de Montmorency,\r\nin which the count palatine acknowledged the receipt from the English\r\nQueen of 50,000 “crowns of the sun, each crown being of the value\r\nof six English shillings sterling,” which amount was transferred to\r\n“Henri de Bourbon, prince de Condé, chief of those of the religion in\r\nFrance, as well as of those Catholics with them associated” (i. e.,\r\nthe Politiques). Elizabeth’s name was to be shielded throughout, the\r\nelector assuming entire liability for repayment which was to be made\r\n“before the army now levied in Germany for service in France shall\r\ndepart to France” (see _C. S. P. For._, No. 254, “The obligation\r\nand quittance of the prince of Condé,” July 23, 1575, Heidelberg;\r\ncf. _ibid._, _Ven._, 627; July 12, 1575, the guess of the Venetian\r\nambassador in France). Cf. _ibid._, No. 633, September 7, 1575. The\r\nVenetian ambassador seems to have thought that trouble in Ireland would\r\nprevent England from advancing any more to the Huguenots (_ibid._, No.\r\n631, August 9, 1575). The harvest of 1575 was generally good. But no\r\ninvading army would enter France before the grain was cut and stacked\r\n(cf. _ibid._).\r\n\r\n[1712] _C. S. P.

From Dreux\r\nthe duke issued a manifesto, September 17, 1575, in which he explained\r\nhis conduct and complained of the undue taxation and the imposition\r\nwhich the people were suffering in the King’s name, declaring\r\nthat he would take under his protection all the French of the two\r\nreligions, and demanding the call of the Estates-General for redress\r\nof grievances (Claude Haton, II, 781 and note). Alençon styled himself\r\n“Gouverneur-général pour le roy et protecteur de la liberté et bien\r\npublique de France” (_C. S. P. For._, No. 365, September, 1575).\r\n\r\n[1715] Claude Haton, II, 784, 785.\r\n\r\n[1716] Paris furnished the King 4,000 soldiers at its own expense. The\r\nnew troops were lodged in the faubourgs of St. Germain, St. Marceau,\r\nand Notre-Dame des Champs (_ibid._, 787).\r\n\r\n[1717] Claude Haton, II, 788-89; D’Aubigné, Book VII, chap. xix. From\r\nthis circumstance the duke was often called Le Balafré. (_C. S. P.\r\nFor._, No. 450, November 10, 1575.)\r\n\r\n[1718] Claude Haton, II, 797.\r\n\r\n[1719] _C. S. P. For._, No. 422, October 29, 1575. The King called\r\nthese pilgrimages “nouaines” (cf. _ibid._, No. 506, Dr. Dale to Lord\r\nBurghley, December 20, 1575).\r\n\r\n[1720] Protestant worship was provisionally authorized in the towns\r\nheld by the confederates. Angoulême and Bourges refused to open their\r\ngates to Alençon and so he was offered Cognac and St. Jean-d’Angély\r\ninstead. The prince of Condé was refused admittance to Mezières (Claude\r\nHaton, II, 805, note).\r\n\r\n[1721] For details as to this levy, see Claude Haton, II, 804. This\r\ntax was laid upon the clergy, as well as others, and called forth a\r\nprotest from the former, who pleaded an edict issued by Henry III at\r\nAvignon shortly after his return from Poland, forbidding the governors\r\nto enforce the payment of tailles, munitions, etc., upon the clergy.\r\n\r\n[1722] Fontanon, IV, 840.\r\n\r\n[1723] Claude Haton, II, 820.\r\n\r\n[1724] Paris remonstrated against this (_ibid._, 828 and note 1).\r\n\r\n[1725] _Ibid._, 817; L’Estoile, I, 46.\r\n\r\n[1726] Claude Haton, II, 806-8.\r\n\r\n[1727] _C. S. P. For._, No. 535.\r\n\r\n[1728] Dr. Dale writes on February 28: “The Guises are nothing privy to\r\nthe queen mother’s doings and she likes as evil of them.”—_C. S. P.\r\nFor._, No. 634, February 28, 1576.\r\n\r\n[1729] _C. S. P. For._, No. 592, January 1576: “The King of Spain makes\r\nthe King very great offers to break the peace.”\r\n\r\n[1730] Dr. Dale to Sir Thomas Smith and Walsingham. All the fair\r\npromises of the delivery of Bourges and La Charité are like to come to\r\nnothing, as may appear by the enclosed letter of Monsieur to the Court\r\nof Parliament. There is a secret League between Guise, Nemours, Nevers,\r\nMaine, and others of that house, together with the Chancellor, against\r\nall that would have any peace, and if it should be made, to begin a\r\nsharp war afresh (_C. S. P. For._, No. 583, _anno_ 1576). From the\r\nfirst Languet was skeptical. He anticipated reaction (_Epist. secr._,\r\nI, Part II, 181, 205).\r\n\r\n[1731] M. Frémy has published a work in which he makes the bizarre\r\nclaim that the origin of the Académie française is to be at least\r\nremotely ascribed to Henry III (_Les origines de l’Académie française._\r\n_L’Académie des derniers Valois, 1570-1585_, d’après des documents\r\nnouveaux et inédits, 1888. There is a review of it in the _English\r\nHist. Review_, III, 576). Some one has said that “all the Valois\r\nkings were either bad or mad.” The aphorism would seem to apply to\r\nthe character of Henry III, in both capacities. He was a mountebank,\r\na roisterer, a dabbler in philosophy, a religious maniac, and a moral\r\npervert. L’Estoile and Lippomano especially abound in allusions or\r\naccounts of him (e. g., _Rel. vén._, II, 237-39). Compare this account\r\nwith the earlier observations of Suriano, _ibid._, I, 409, and Davila,\r\nVII, 442. On the “mignons,” Henry III’s favorites, see L’Estoile, I,\r\n142, 143. Henry III’s very handwriting manifests his character: “Son\r\nécriture semble tout d’abord régulière, mais elle n’est pas formée,\r\nles lettres s’alignent sans s’unir, sans se rejoindre, certainement\r\nc’est une des écritures les plus difficiles à déchiffrer.... C’est\r\nl’homme qui s’y révèle l’indolent, l’efféminé monarque qui de son lit\r\nécrivait ces lignes à Villeroy: ‘J’ay eu le plaisir d’avoir veu vostre\r\nmémoire très bien faict comme tout ce qui sort de vostre boutique, mais\r\nil fault bien penser, car nous avons besoin de regarder de près à nos\r\naffaires. Je seray sitost là que ce seroit peine perdue d’y répondre.\r\nAussi bien suis-je au lit _non malade, non pour poltronner, mais pour\r\nme retrouver frais comme la rose_.’”—La Ferrière, _Rapport de St.\r\nPétersbourg_, 27.\r\n\r\n[1732] See the remonstrance in _C. S. P. For._, No. 505, December 19,\r\n1575.\r\n\r\n[1733] _Ibid._, No. 584, January 9, 1576.\r\n\r\n[1734] For particulars see Dale’s letter to Smith and Walsingham,\r\n_ibid._, No. 605, February 6, 1576; Claude Haton, II, 829.\r\n\r\n[1735] _C. S. P. For._, Nos. 614, 625, 662, February 14-22, March 8,\r\n1576. Mayenne, whose marquisate was erected into a duchy on January 1,\r\n1576, had succeeded his brother, the duke of Guise, as chief commander\r\nof the royal forces, and advanced toward Lorraine in order to prevent\r\nthe reiters from joining the enemy. Henry III had sent Biron (he had\r\nbeen made a marshal in the June preceding—_ibid._, No. 178, June 13,\r\n1575) to them to persuade them not to enter France, representing that a\r\ntruce had been concluded between the King and the duke of Alençon. But\r\nthe prince of Condé replied that if the duke had made his peace with\r\nthe King, he, the prince, had not. Biron failed and La Noue was sent,\r\nwho likewise was unsuccessful (Claude Haton, II, 824, 825).\r\n\r\n[1736] _C. S. P. For._, No. 662, Dale to Smith and Walsingham, March 8,\r\n1576; Claude Haton, II, 832.\r\n\r\n[1737] _C. S. P. For._, No. 740, April 17, 1576.\r\n\r\n[1738] Dr. Dale wrote truly to Lord Burghley saying that the\r\nProtestants had “gotten more without any stroke stricken than ever\r\ncould be had before this time by all the wars, as appears by the note\r\nof the provinces that are to be under the government of them and their\r\nfriends.”—_C. S. P. For._, No. 777, May 11, 1576.\r\n\r\n[1739] La Popelinière, III, 361.\r\n\r\n[1740] This claim ran back to the reign of Charles VII; the original\r\namount was 25,000 livres. Louis XI altered it to 6,000 livres, plus the\r\ncounty of Gaure and the town of Fleurance, and this revised form was\r\napproved by Charles VIII in 1496 (cf. _C. S. P. For._, No. 672, §5; May\r\n16, 1576).\r\n\r\n[1741] Henry of Navarre’s memoir is given _in extenso_ in _ibid._, No.\r\n671, May 15, 1576.\r\n\r\n[1742] La Popelinière, III, 365.\r\n\r\n[1743] Maffert, _Les apanages en France du XVI^[e] au XIX^[e] siècle_\r\n(1900).\r\n\r\n[1744] Articles du maréchal de Dampville, gouverneur de Languedoc et\r\ndes Etats du pays, présentés au Roi pour la décharge de la province,\r\nMay 2, 1576.—Coll.

The\r\nsources for the history are many. The correspondence of Dale, the\r\nEnglish ambassador in France, and the other English agents, Wilkes and\r\nRandolph, in _C. S. P. For._, 1876, for March, April, and May, is full\r\nand detailed (cf. D’Aubigné, Book VIII, chap. xxvii; De Thou, Book\r\nLXXII). La Popelinière, III, 360 ff., gives the text of the treaty and\r\nthe letters-patent of the King. The act was registered in Parlement on\r\nMay 14, 1576, though signed by the King on May 2.\r\n\r\n[1747] Two days before this scene took place, the newly elected king of\r\nPoland Stephen Bathori, prince of Transylvania, had written informing\r\nthe deposed Valois that he had assumed the Polish crown and desiring to\r\nknow what Henry would have done with the household stuff he had left\r\nbehind in Poland (_C. S. P. For._, No. 789, May 29, 1576). The Emperor\r\nhad had numerous partisans, but refused to accept the condition that he\r\nfix his residence in Poland (_Epist. secr._, I, Part II, 143).\r\n\r\n[1748] See the vivid details in Claude Haton, II, 834-40, 847, 851, 858.\r\n\r\n[1749] _Ibid._, 855-60.\r\n\r\n[1750] The words in brackets are faded and are supplied from No. 460.\r\n\r\n[1751] Ellipses indicate places where the MS is faded or creased so as\r\nto be illegible.\r\n\r\n[1752] The words in brackets are faded and are supplied from No. 455.\r\n\r\n[1753] The date is in Burghley’s hand.\r\n\r\n[1754] The MS is torn here.\r\n\r\n[1755] The reference to the original cipher is “State Papers, Scotland,\r\nElizabeth, Vol. III, No. 82.” (This is not signed addressed or\r\nendorsed.
