The world was\r\nfast becoming more secular in its tendencies, and, as a necessary\r\nresult, theories and principles that had met till then with almost\r\nuniversal acceptance in literature, in art, in education, and in\r\ngovernment, were challenged by many as untenable.\r\n\r\nScholasticism, which had monopolised the attention of both schools and\r\nscholars since the days of St. Anselm and Abelard, was called upon to\r\ndefend its claims against the advocates of classical culture; the\r\ntheocratico-imperial conception of Christian society as expounded by\r\nthe canonists and lawyers of an earlier period was forced into the\r\nbackground by the appearance of nationalism and individualism, which\r\nby this time had become factors to be reckoned with by the\r\necclesiastical and civil rulers; the Feudal System, which had received\r\na mortal blow by the intermingling of the classes and the masses in\r\nthe era of the Crusades, was threatened, from above, by the movement\r\ntowards centralisation and absolutism, and from below, by the growing\r\ndiscontent of the peasantry and artisans, who had begun to realise,\r\nbut as yet only in a vague way, their own strength. In every\r\ndepartment the battle for supremacy was being waged between the old\r\nand the new, and the printing-press was at hand to enable the patrons\r\nof both to mould the thoughts and opinions of the Christian world.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, an age of unrest and of great intellectual\r\nactivity, and at all such times the claims of the Church as the\r\nguardian and expounder of Divine Revelation are sure to be questioned.\r\nNot that the Church has need to fear inquiry, or that the claims of\r\nfaith and reason are incompatible, but because some daring spirits are\r\nalways to be reckoned with, who, by mistaking hypotheses for facts,\r\nsucceed in convincing themselves and their followers that those in\r\nauthority are unprogressive, and as such, to be despised.\r\n\r\nThis was particularly true of some of the Humanists. At first sight,\r\nindeed, it is difficult to understand why the revival of classical\r\nlearning should lead to the danger of the rejection of Christian\r\nRevelation, seeing that the appreciation of the great literary\r\nproducts of Greece and Rome, and that, even in the days of the\r\nRenaissance, the Popes and the bishops were reckoned amongst the most\r\ngenerous patrons of the classical movement. Yet the violence of\r\nextreme partisans on both sides rendered a conflict almost\r\nunavoidable.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, many of the classical enthusiasts, not content with\r\nwinning for their favourite studies a most important place on the\r\nprogrammes of the schools, were determined to force on the Christian\r\nbody the ideals, the culture, and the outlook on the world, which\r\nfound their best expression in the masterpieces of pagan literature;\r\nwhile, on the other, not a few of the champions of Scholastic\r\nPhilosophy seemed to have convinced themselves that Scholasticism and\r\nChristianity were identified so closely that rejection or criticism of\r\nthe former must imply disloyalty to the latter. The Humanists mocked\r\nat the Scholastics and dubbed them obscurantists on account of their\r\nbarbarous Latinity, their uncritical methods, and their pointless\r\nwranglings; the Scholastics retorted by denouncing their opponents as\r\npagans, or, at least, heretics. In this way the claims of religion\r\nwere drawn into the arena, and, as neither the extreme Scholastics nor\r\nthe extreme Humanists had learned to distinguish between dogmas and\r\nsystems, between what was essential and what was tentative, there was\r\ngrave danger that religion would suffer in the eyes of educated men on\r\naccount of the crude methods of those who claimed to be its authorised\r\nexponents.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, at such a period of unrest, the Church could hardly\r\nexpect to escape attack. Never since the days when she was called upon\r\nto defend her position against the combined forces of the Pagan world\r\nhad she been confronted with such a serious crisis, and seldom, if\r\never, was she so badly prepared to withstand the onslaughts of her\r\nenemies. The residence at Avignon, the Great Western Schism, and the\r\nconciliar theories to which the Schism gave rise, had weakened the\r\npower of the Papacy at the very time when the bonds of religious unity\r\nwere being strained almost to the snapping point by the growth of\r\nnational jealousy. Partly owing to the general downward tendency of\r\nthe age, but mainly on account of the interference of the secular\r\nauthorities with ecclesiastical appointments, the gravest abuses had\r\nmanifested themselves in nearly every department of clerical life, and\r\nthe cry for reform rose unbidden to the lips of thousands who\r\nentertained no thought of revolution. But the distinction between the\r\ndivine and the human element in the Church was not appreciated by all,\r\nwith the result that a great body of Christians, disgusted with the\r\nunworthiness of some of their pastors, were quite ready to rise in\r\nrevolt whenever a leader should appear to sound the trumpet-call of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nNor had they long to wait till a man arose, in Germany, to marshal the\r\nforces of discontent and to lead them against the Church of Rome.\r\nThough in his personal conduct Luther fell far short of what people\r\nmight reasonably look for in a self-constituted reformer, yet in many\r\nrespects he had exceptional qualifications for the part that he was\r\ncalled upon to play. Endowed with great physical strength, gifted with\r\na marvellous memory and a complete mastery of the German language, as\r\ninspiring in the pulpit or on the platform as he was with his pen,\r\nregardless of nice limitations or even of truth when he wished to\r\nstrike down an opponent or to arouse the enthusiasm of a mob, equally\r\nat home with princes in the drawing-room as with peasants in a tavern\r\n--Luther was an ideal demagogue to head a semi-religious, semi-social\r\nrevolt. He had a keen appreciation of the tendencies of the age, and\r\nof the thoughts that were coursing through men's minds, and he had\r\nsufficient powers of organisation to know how to direct the different\r\nforces at work into the same channel. Though fundamentally the issue\r\nraised by him was a religious one, yet it is remarkable what a small\r\npart religion played in deciding the result of the struggle. The\r\nworld-wide jealousy of the House of Habsburg, the danger of a Turkish\r\ninvasion, the long-drawn-out struggle between France and the Empire\r\nfor supremacy in Europe and for the provinces on the left bank of the\r\nRhine, and the selfish policy of the German princes, contributed much\r\nmore to his success than the question of justification or the\r\nprinciple of private judgment. Without doubt, in Germany, in\r\nSwitzerland, in England, in the Netherlands, and in the Scandinavian\r\ncountries, the Reformation was much more a political than a religious\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principle of the new religion was the principle of\r\nprivate judgment, and yet such a principle found no place in the\r\nissues raised by Luther in the beginning. It was only when he was\r\nconfronted with the decrees of previous councils, with the tradition\r\nof the Church as contained in the writings of the Fathers, and with\r\nthe authoritative pronouncements of the Holy See, all of which were in\r\ndirect contradiction to his theories, that he felt himself obliged,\r\nreluctantly, to abandon the principle of authority in favour of the\r\nprinciple of private judgment. In truth it was the only possible way\r\nin which he could hope to defend his novelties, and besides, it had\r\nthe additional advantage of catering for the rising spirit of\r\nindividualism, which was so characteristic of the age.\r\n\r\nHis second great innovation, so far as the divine constitution of the\r\nChurch was concerned, and the one which secured ultimately whatever\r\ndegree of success his revolution attained, was the theory of royal\r\nsupremacy, or the recognition of the temporal ruler as the source of\r\nspiritual jurisdiction. But even this was more or less of an after-\r\nthought. Keen student of contemporary politics that Luther was, he\r\nperceived two great influences at work, one, patronised by the\r\nsovereigns in favour of absolute rule, the other, supported by the\r\nmasses in favour of unrestricted liberty. He realised from the\r\nbeginning that it was only by combining his religious programme with\r\none or other of these two movements that he could have any hope of\r\nsuccess. At first, impressed by the strength of the popular party as\r\nmanifested in the net-work of secret societies then spread throughout\r\nGermany, and by the revolutionary attitude of the landless nobles, who\r\nwere prepared to lead the peasants, he determined to raise the cry of\r\ncivil and religious liberty, and to rouse the masses against the\r\nprinces and kings, as well as against their bishops and the Pope. But\r\nsoon the success of the German princes in the Peasants' War made it\r\nclear to him that an alliance between the religious and the social\r\nrevolution was fraught with dangerous consequences; and, at once, he\r\nwent to the other extreme.\r\n\r\nThe gradual weakening of the Feudal System, which acted as a check\r\nupon the authority of the rulers, and the awakening of the national\r\nconsciousness, prepared the way for the policy of centralisation.\r\nFrance, which consisted formerly of a collection of almost independent\r\nprovinces, was welded together into one united kingdom; a similar\r\nchange took place in Spain after the union of Castile and Aragon and\r\nthe fall of the Moorish power at Granada. In England the disappearance\r\nof the nobles in the Wars of the Roses led to the establishment of the\r\nTudor domination. As a result of this centralisation the Kings of\r\nFrance, Spain, and England, and the sovereign princes of Germany\r\nreceived a great increase of power, and resolved to make themselves\r\nabsolute masters in their own dominions.\r\n\r\nHaving abandoned the unfortunate peasants who had been led to\r\nslaughter by his writings, Luther determined to make it clear that his\r\nreligious policy was in complete harmony with the political absolutism\r\naimed at by the temporal rulers. With this object in view he put\r\nforward the principle of royal supremacy, according to which the king\r\nor prince was to be recognised as the head of the church in his own\r\nterritories, and the source of all spiritual jurisdiction. By doing so\r\nhe achieved two very important results. He had at hand in the\r\nmachinery of civil government the nucleus of a new ecclesiastical\r\norganisation, the shaping of which had been his greatest worry; and,\r\nbesides, he won for his new movement the sympathy and active support\r\nof the civil rulers, to whom the thought of becoming complete masters\r\nof ecclesiastical patronage and of the wealth of the Church opened up\r\nthe most rosy prospects. In Germany, in England, and in the northern\r\ncountries of Europe, it was the principle of royal supremacy that\r\nturned the scales eventually in favour of the new religion, while, at\r\nthe same time, it led to the establishment of absolutism both in\r\ntheory and practice. From the recognition of the sovereign as supreme\r\nmaster both in Church and State the theory of the divine rights of\r\nkings as understood in modern times followed as a necessary corollary.\r\nThere was no longer any possibility of suggesting limitations or of\r\ncountenancing rebellion. The king, in his own territories, had\r\nsucceeded to all the rights and privileges which, according to the\r\ndivine constitution of the Church, belonged to the Pope.\r\n\r\nSuch a development in the Protestant countries could not fail to\r\nproduce its effects even on Catholic rulers who had remained loyal to\r\nthe Church. They began to aim at combining, as far as possible, the\r\nProtestant theory of ecclesiastical government with obedience to the\r\nPope, by taking into their own hands the administration of\r\necclesiastical affairs, by making the bishops and clergy state-\r\nofficials, and by leaving to the Pope only a primacy of honour. This\r\npolicy, known under the different names of Gallicanism in France, and\r\nof Febronianism and Josephism in the Empire, led of necessity to\r\nconflicts between Rome and the Catholic sovereigns of Europe,\r\nconflicts in which, unfortunately, many of the bishops, influenced by\r\nmistaken notions of loyalty and patriotism, took the side of their own\r\nsovereigns. As a result, absolute rule was established throughout\r\nEurope; the rights of the people to any voice in government were\r\ntrampled upon, and the rules became more despotic than the old Roman\r\nEmperors had been even in their two-fold capacity of civil ruler and\r\nhigh priest.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the principle of private judgment had produced its logical\r\neffects. Many of Luther's followers, even in his own lifetime, had\r\nbeen induced to reject doctrines accepted by their master, but, after\r\nhis death, when the influence of Tradition and of authority had become\r\nweaker, Lutheranism was reduced to a dogmatic chaos. By the\r\napplication of the principle of private judgment, certain leaders\r\nbegan to call in question, not merely individual doctrines, but even\r\nthe very foundations of Christianity, and, in a short time, Atheism\r\nand Naturalism were recognised as the hall-mark of education and good\r\nbreeding.\r\n\r\nThe civil rulers even in Catholic countries took no very active steps\r\nto curb the activity of the anti-Christian writers and philosophers,\r\npartly because they themselves were not unaffected by the spirit of\r\nirreligion, and partly also because they were not sorry to see popular\r\nresentment diverted from their own excesses by being directed against\r\nthe Church. But, in a short time, they realised, when it was too late,\r\nthat the overthrow of religious authority carries with it as a rule\r\nthe overthrow of civil authority also, and that the attempt to combine\r\nthe two principles of private judgment and of royal supremacy must\r\nlead of necessity to revolution.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI wish to express my sincere thanks to the many friends who have\r\nassisted me, and particularly to the Very Rev.

Some few teachers here and there, alarmed by the\r\ndanger of corrupting Christian youth by bringing it into contact with\r\nPagan ideals, raised their voices in protest, but the majority of the\r\nearly Fathers disregarded these warnings as harmful and unnecessary.\r\nOrigen, St. Clement of Alexandria, St. Gregory of Nazianzen, St.\r\nBasil, and St. Jerome, while not ignoring the dangers of such studies,\r\nrecommended them warmly to their students, and in the spirit of these\r\ngreat leaders the Catholic Church strove always to combine classical\r\nculture and Christian education.\r\n\r\nWith the fall of the Empire, consequent upon its invasion by the\r\nbarbarian hordes, classical studies were banished to some extent to\r\nthe Western Isles, Ireland and Britain, from which they were\r\ntransplanted to the Continent principally during the Carlovingian\r\nrevival.[1] In the cathedral, collegiate, and monastic schools the\r\nclassics were still cultivated, though beyond doubt compilations were\r\nused more frequently than were the original works; and even in the\r\ndarkest days of the dark ages some prominent ecclesiastics could be\r\nfound well versed at least in the language and literature of Rome. It\r\nlooked, too, for a time, as if the intellectual revival of the twelfth\r\ncentury were to be turned towards the classics; but the example of men\r\nlike John of Salisbury was not followed generally, and the movement\r\ndeveloped rapidly in the direction of philosophy. As a consequence,\r\nthe study of Latin was neglected or relegated to a secondary place in\r\nthe schools, while Greek scholarship disappeared practically from\r\nWestern Europe. The Scholastics, more anxious about the logical\r\nsequence of their arguments than about the beauties of literary\r\nexpression, invented for themselves a new dialect, which, however\r\nforcible in itself, must have sounded barbarous to any one acquainted\r\nwith the productions of the golden age of Roman literature or even\r\nwith the writings of the early Fathers of the Latin Church. Nor was it\r\nthe language merely that was neglected. The monuments and memorials of\r\nan earlier civilisation were disregarded, and even in Rome itself, the\r\nCity of the Popes, the vandalism of the ignorant wrought dreadful\r\nhavoc.\r\n\r\nSo complete a turning away from forces that had played such a part in\r\nthe civilisation of the world was certain to provoke a reaction.\r\nScholasticism could not hold the field for ever to the exclusion of\r\nother branches of study, especially, since in the less competent hands\r\nof its later expounders it had degenerated into an empty formalism.\r\nThe successors of St. Thomas and St. Bonaventure had little of their\r\noriginality, their almost universal knowledge, and their powers of\r\nexposition, and, as a result, students grew tired of the endless\r\nwranglings of the schools, and turned their attention to other\r\nintellectual pursuits.\r\n\r\nBesides, men's ideas of politics, of social order, and of religion\r\nwere changing rapidly, and, in a word, the whole outlook of the world\r\nwas undergoing a speedy transformation. In the Middle Ages religion\r\nheld the dominant position and was the guiding principle in morals, in\r\neducation, in literature, and in art; but as the faith of many began\r\nto grow cold, and as the rights of Church and State began to be\r\ndistinguished, secularist tendencies soon made themselves felt.\r\nPhilosophy and theology were no longer to occupy the entire\r\nintellectual field, and other subjects for investigation must be\r\nfound. In these circumstances what was more natural than that some\r\nshould advocate a return to the classics and all that the classics\r\nenshrined? Again, the example set by the tyrants who had grasped the\r\nreins of power in the Italian States, by men like Agnello of Pisa, the\r\nViscontis and Francesco Sforza of Milan, Ferrante of Naples, and the\r\nde' Medici of Florence, was calculated to lower the moral standard of\r\nthe period, and to promote an abandonment of Christian principles of\r\ntruth, and justice, and purity of life. Everywhere men became more\r\naddicted to the pursuit of sensual pleasure, of vain glory, and\r\nmaterial comfort; and could ill brook the dominant ideas of the Middle\r\nAges concerning the supernatural end of man, self-denial, humility,\r\npatience, and contempt for the things that minister only to man's\r\ntemporal happiness. With views of this kind in the air it was not\r\ndifficult to persuade them to turn to the great literary masterpieces\r\nof Pagan Rome, where they were likely to find principles and ideals\r\nmore in harmony with their tastes than those set before them by the\r\nCatholic Church.\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries, then, mark a\r\nperiod of transition from the Middle Ages to modern times. They saw a\r\nsharp struggle being waged between two ideals in politics, in\r\neducation, in literature, in religion, and in morality. In this great\r\nupheaval that was characterised by a demand for unrestricted liberty\r\nof investigation, a return to the study of nature and of the natural\r\nsciences, the rise and development of national literatures, and the\r\nappearance of a new school of art, the Humanist movement or the\r\nrevival of the study of the classics, the /literae humaniores/, played\r\nthe fundamental part. In more senses than one it may be called the Age\r\nof the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nNor was it a matter of chance that this revival of interest in\r\nclassical studies should have made itself felt first in Italy, where\r\nthe downfall of the Empire, and the subsequent development of petty\r\nstates seem to have exercised a magical influence upon the\r\nintellectual development of the people. The Italians were the direct\r\nheirs to the glory of ancient Rome. Even in the days of their\r\ndegradation, when the capital deserted by the Popes was fast going to\r\nruin, and when foreigners and native tyrants were struggling for the\r\npossession of their fairest territories, the memory of the imperial\r\nauthority of their country, and the crumbling monuments that bore\r\nwitness to it still standing in their midst, served to turn their\r\npatriotic ardour towards the great literary treasures bequeathed to\r\nthem by Pagan Rome. Greek literature, too, was not forgotten, though\r\nin the thirteenth century few western scholars possessed any\r\nacquaintance with the language. Many causes, however, combined to\r\nprepare the way for a revival of Greek. The commercial cities of Italy\r\nwere in close touch with the Eastern Empire, especially since the\r\nCrusades; ambassadors, sent by the Emperors to seek the assistance of\r\nthe Pope and of the Western rulers in the struggle against the Turks,\r\nwere passing from court to court; the negotiations for a reunion of\r\nthe Churches, which had been going on since the days of the first\r\nCouncil of Lyons, rendered a knowledge of Greek and of the writings of\r\nthe Greek Fathers necessary for some of the leading ecclesiastics of\r\nthe West; while, finally, the fall of Constantinople in 1453 forced\r\nmany Greek scholars to seek a refuge in Italy or France, and provided\r\nthe agents sent by the Popes and Italian rulers with a splendid\r\nopportunity of securing priceless treasures for the Western libraries.\r\n\r\nThough Dante (1265-1321) is sometimes regarded as the earliest of the\r\nHumanist school[2] on account of his professed admiration for some of\r\nthe Pagan masters and of the blending in his /Divina Comedia/ of the\r\nbeauties of Roman literature with the teaching of the Fathers and\r\nScholastics, still, the spirit that inspired him was the spirit of\r\nChristianity, and his outlook on life was frankly the outlook of the\r\nMiddle Ages. To Petrarch (1304-74) rather belongs the honour of having\r\nbeen the most prominent, if not the very first writer, whose works\r\nwere influenced largely by Humanist ideals. Born in Arezzo in 1304, he\r\naccompanied his father to Avignon when the latter was exiled from\r\nFlorence. His friends wished him to study law; but, his poetic\r\ntendencies proving too strong for him, he abandoned his professional\r\npursuits to devote his energies to literature. The patronage and help\r\nafforded him willingly by the Avignonese Popes[3] and other\r\necclesiastics provided him with the means of pursuing his favourite\r\nstudies, and helped him considerably in his searches for manuscripts\r\nof the classics. Though only a cleric in minor orders, he was\r\nappointed Canon of Lombez (1335), papal ambassador to Naples (1343),\r\nprothonotary apostolic (1346), and archdeacon of Parma (1348). These\r\npositions secured to him a competent income, and, at the same time,\r\nbrought him into touch with libraries and influential men.\r\n\r\nThe ruin of Italy and Rome, caused in great measure by the absence of\r\nthe Popes during their residence at Avignon, roused all the patriotic\r\ninstincts of Petrarch, and urged him to strive with all his might for\r\nthe restoration of the ancient glory of his country. Hence in his\r\npolitics he was strongly nationalist, and hence, too, he threw the\r\nwhole weight of his influence on the side of Cola di Rienzi, when in\r\n1347 the latter proclaimed from the Capitol the establishment of the\r\nRoman Republic. Nor did he hesitate to attack the Popes, to whom he\r\nwas indebted so deeply, for their neglect of Rome and the Papal\r\nStates, as well as for the evils which he thought had fallen upon\r\nItaly owing to the withdrawal of the Popes to Avignon. He himself\r\nstrove to awaken in the minds of his countrymen memories of the past\r\nby forming collections of old Roman coins, by restoring or protecting\r\nwherever possible the Pagan monuments, and by searching after and\r\ncopying manuscripts of the classical writers. In poetry, Virgil was\r\nhis favourite guide. As a rule he wrote in Italian, but his writings\r\nwere saturated with the spirit of the early Pagan authors; while in\r\nhis pursuit of glory and his love for natural, sensible beauty, he\r\nmanifested tendencies opposed directly to the self-restraint,\r\nsymbolism, and purity of the Middle Ages. His longest poem is\r\n/Africa/, devoted to a rehearsal of the glories of ancient Rome and\r\nbreathing a spirit of patriotism and zeal for a long lost culture, but\r\nit is rather for his love songs, the /canzoni/, that he is best\r\nremembered.\r\n\r\nPetrarch, though a Humanist,[4] was no enemy of the Christian\r\nreligion, nor did he imagine for a moment that the study of the Pagan\r\nclassics could prove dangerous in the least degree to revealed\r\nreligion. It is true that his private life did not always correspond\r\nto Christian principles of morality, and it is equally true that at\r\ntimes his patriotism led him to speak harshly of the rule of the Popes\r\nin Italy and Rome; but he never wavered in his religious convictions,\r\nand never recognised that Pagan literature and ideals should be judged\r\nby other than current Christian standards.\r\n\r\nThe example of Petrarch was not followed, however, by several of the\r\nlater Humanists. His friend and disciple, Boccaccio (1313-75),\r\nimitated his master in his love for the classics and in his zeal for\r\nclassical culture, and excelled him by acquiring, what Petrarch had\r\nfailed utterly to acquire, a good knowledge of Greek. Like Petrarch,\r\nhe was assisted largely by the Popes, and took service at the papal\r\ncourt. But his views of life and morality were coloured by Paganism\r\nrather than by Christianity. Many of his minor poems are steeped in\r\nindecency and immorality, and reflect only too clearly the tendency to\r\ntreachery and deceit so characteristic of the Italian rulers of his\r\nday; while the /Decameron/, his greatest work, is more like the\r\nproduction of a Pagan writer than of one acquainted with Christian\r\nethics and ideals. He delighted in lampooning the clergy, particularly\r\nthe monks, charging them with ignorance, immorality, and hypocrisy.\r\nSuch a line of conduct was not likely to recommend the apostles of the\r\nnew learning to the admirers of Scholasticism, nor to create and\r\nfoster a friendly alliance between the two camps. Yet, personally,\r\nBoccaccio was not an enemy of Christianity, and never aimed, as did\r\nsome of the later Humanists, at reviving Paganism under the guise of\r\npromoting literature. He was unshaken in his acceptance of the\r\nChristian revelation, and, as the years advanced, he began to realise\r\nthe evil of his ways and the dangerous character of his writings.\r\nStrange to say, it was to a body of the monks, whom he delighted in\r\nattacking, that he bequeathed the valuable library which he had\r\nbrought together with such labour.\r\n\r\nHad the Humanists contented themselves with advocating merely a return\r\nto classical studies, and had the Scholastics recognised that\r\nphilosophy was not the only path to culture, it might have been\r\npossible to avoid a conflict. But, unfortunately for religion, there\r\nwere extremists on both sides. On the one hand, some of the later\r\nHumanists, influenced largely by the low moral tone of the age, aimed\r\nat nothing less than the revival of Paganism, pure and simple; while,\r\non the other, not a few of the Scholastics insisted strongly that\r\nPagan literature, however perfect, should have no place in Christian\r\neducation. Between these two conflicting parties stood a large body of\r\neducated men, both lay and cleric, who could see no irreconcilable\r\nopposition between Christianity and the study of the classics, and who\r\naimed at establishing harmony by assigning to the classics the place\r\nin education willingly accorded to them by many of the Fathers of the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nBut the influence of this latter body could not effect a\r\nreconciliation. A large section of the Humanists openly vindicated for\r\nthemselves freedom from the intellectual and moral restraints imposed\r\nby Christianity. Laurentius Valla[5] (1405-57) in his work, /De\r\nVoluptate/, championed free indulgence in all kinds of sensual\r\npleasures, attacked virginity as a crime against the human race, and\r\nridiculed the idea of continence and self-denial, while in his own\r\nlife he showed himself a faithful disciple of the Epicurianism that he\r\npropounded in his writings. His denunciations, too, of the Popes as\r\nthe usurping tyrants of Rome in his work on the Constantine Donation\r\nwere likely to do serious injury to the head of the Church in his\r\nspiritual as well as in his temporal capacity. But bad as were the\r\ncompositions of Valla, they were harmless when compared with the books\r\nand pamphlets of Beccadelli, the Panormite, who devoted himself almost\r\nexclusively to what was indecent and repulsive. Poggio Bracciolini in\r\nhis work, /Facetiae/, and Filelfo, though not equally bad, belong to\r\nthe same category. In the hands of these men the Renaissance had\r\nbecome, to a great extent, a glorification of Pagan immorality. Their\r\nbooks were condemned by many of the religious orders, but without\r\navail. They were read and enjoyed by thousands, in whom the wholesale\r\ncorruption prevalent in Florence, Siena, and Venice, had deadened all\r\nsense of morality.\r\n\r\nA large number of the later Renaissance school were Christians only in\r\nname. If the great body of them were judged by the heathen figures and\r\nphraseology with which their works abound, they could hardly be\r\nacquitted of Pagan tendencies; but in case of many of them these\r\nexcesses are to be attributed to pedantry rather than to defection\r\nfrom the faith. In case of others, however, although they were wary in\r\ntheir expressions lest they might forfeit their positions, Christian\r\nteaching seems to have lost its hold upon their minds and hearts.\r\nCarlo Marsuppini, Chancellor of Florence, Gemistos Plethon, the well-\r\nknown exponent of Platonic philosophy, Marsilio Ficino, Rinaldo degli\r\nAlbizzi, and the members of the Roman Academy (1460), under the\r\nleadership of Pomponius Laetus, were openly Pagan in their lives and\r\nwritings. Had the men in authority in Italy been less depraved such\r\nteaching and example would have been suppressed with firmness; or had\r\nthe vast body of the people been less sound in their attachment to\r\nChristianity, Neo-Paganism would have arisen triumphant from the\r\nreligious chaos.[6]\r\n\r\nBut not all of the Humanists belonged to the school of Valla,\r\nBeccadelli, Poggio, and Marsuppini. The Camaldolese monk, Ambrogio\r\nTraversari, his pupil Giannozzo Manetti (1431-59), a layman thoroughly\r\ndevoted to the Church, and the first of the Humanists to turn his\r\nattention to the Oriental languages, Lionardo Bruni, so long Apostolic\r\nSecretary at the papal court and afterwards Chancellor of Florence,\r\nMaffeo Vegio (1407-58), the Roman archaeologist, who in his work on\r\neducation endeavoured to combine classical culture with Christian\r\nrevelation, Vittorino da Feltre, a model in his life and methods for\r\nChristian teachers, Pico della Mirandola, Sadoleto, and Bida, were all\r\nprominent in the classical revival, but at the same time thoroughly\r\nloyal to the Church. They were the moderate men between the Pagan\r\nHumanists and the extreme Scholastics. Their aim was to promote\r\nlearning and education, and to widen the field of knowledge by the\r\nintroduction of the ancient literary masterpieces, not at the expense\r\nof an abandonment of Christianity, but under the auspices and in\r\nsupport of the Catholic Church. Following in the footsteps of Origen,\r\nSt. Gregory, St. Basil, and St. Augustine, they knew how to admire the\r\nbeauties of Pagan literature without accepting its spirit or ideals,\r\nand hence they have been called the Christian Humanists.\r\n\r\nThe revival of Greek in Italy, where Greek literature was practically\r\nunknown, is due in great measure to the arrival of Greek scholars, who\r\nwere induced to come by promises of a salary and position, or who\r\ntravelled thither on political or ecclesiastical missions. Of these\r\nthe principal were Manuel Chruysoloras engaged at work in Florence\r\nfrom 1396, Cardinal Bessarion (1403?-72) who came westward for the\r\nCouncil of Florence and ended his days in Venice to which he\r\nbequeathed his library, Gemistos Plethon (1355-1450) the principal\r\nagent in the establishment of the Platonic academy at Florence, George\r\nof Trebizond, Theodore Gaza, Lascaris, Andronicus Callistus, and\r\nothers who fled from Greece to escape the domination of the Turks.\r\nWith the help of these men and their pupils a knowledge of Greek and\r\nof Greek literature was diffused through Italy, and in a short time\r\nthroughout the Continent. Everywhere collections of Greek manuscripts\r\nbegan to be formed; agents were sent to the East to buy them wherever\r\nthey could be discovered, and copyists and translators were busy at\r\nwork in all the leading centres of Italy. The fall of Constantinople\r\nin 1453 tended to help the Greek revival in the West by the dispersion\r\nof both scholars and manuscripts through Italy, France, and Germany.\r\n\r\nHumanism owes its rapid development in Italy not indeed to the\r\nuniversities, for the universities, committed entirely to the\r\nScholastic principles of education, were generally hostile, but rather\r\nto the exertions of wandering teachers and to the generous support of\r\npowerful patrons. In Rome it was the Popes who provided funds for the\r\nsupport of Humanist scholars, for the collection and copying of\r\nmanuscripts, and for the erection of libraries where the great\r\nliterary treasures of Greece and Rome might be available for the\r\ngeneral public; in Florence it was the de' Medici, notably Cosmo\r\n(1429-64) and Lorenzo the Magnificent (1449-92), by whose exertions\r\nFlorence became the greatest centre of literary activity in Europe; in\r\nMilan it was the Viscontis and the Sforzas; in Urbino Duke Federigo\r\nand his friends; and in Ferrara and Mantua the families of d'Este and\r\nGonzaga. Academies took the place of universities. Of these the\r\nacademy of Florence, supported by the de' Medici and patronised by the\r\nleading Greek and Italian scholars, was by far the most influential\r\nand most widely known. The academy of Rome, founded (1460) by\r\nPomponius Laetus, was frankly Pagan in its tone and as such was\r\nsuppressed by Paul II. It was revived, however, and patronised by\r\nSixtus IV., Julius II., and Leo X. Similar institutions were to be\r\nfound in most of the Italian States, notably at Venice and Naples. In\r\nnearly all these cities valuable manuscript libraries were being\r\namassed, and were placed generously at the disposal of scholars.\r\n\r\nAnother important aid to the popularisation of the works of the Greek\r\nand Latin writers was the invention of printing and its introduction\r\ninto Italy. The first printing press in Italy was established at the\r\nBenedictine monastery of Subiaco, whence it was transferred to Rome.\r\nFrom this press were issued editions of the Latin classics, such as\r\nthe works of Lactantius, Caesar, Livy, Aulus Gellius, Virgil, Lucan,\r\nCicero, and Ovid. Aldo Manuzio, himself an enthusiastic student of\r\nGreek literature, settled at Venice in 1490, and established a\r\nprinting press with the intention of bringing out editions of the\r\nprincipal Greek authors. His house was the great centre for Greek\r\nscholars from all parts of Italy, and from the Aldine Press were\r\nissued cheap and accurate editions of the Greek classics. Later on\r\nwhen Florence and Milan were disturbed by the invasion of Charles\r\nVIII. of France (1483-98), and when Naples was captured by the\r\nSpaniards the Humanist movement found a generous patron in Leo X., a\r\nscion of de' Medici family. From the press founded by Leo X. many\r\nclassical texts were issued till the pillaging of the city by the\r\nimperial troops in 1527 dealt a death blow to the revival in Italy.\r\n\r\nThat there was no opposition between the study of the classics and the\r\nteaching of Christianity is evidenced by the friendly attitude adopted\r\nby the Papacy towards the Humanist movement. The Avignon Popes,\r\nBenedict XII. (1334-42) and Clement VI. (1342-52), heaped honours and\r\nemoluments upon Petrarch and provided him with the means of acquiring\r\nmanuscripts and of meeting scholars likely to assist him. A similar\r\nattitude towards the movement was adopted by Urban V. (1362-70). The\r\nleading classical scholars such as Coluccio, Salutati, Francesco\r\nBruni, Lionardo d'Aretino, etc., were employed at the Papal court, and\r\nthe apostolic college of secretaries became one of the greatest\r\ncentres for the propagation of Humanism. The troubles that fell upon\r\nthe Church during the Great Western Schism diverted the attention of\r\nthe rival Popes from literary pursuits; but as soon as peace had been\r\nrestored by the Council of Constance Martin V. (1417-31) assembled\r\naround him in Rome many of the ablest classical scholars, and vied\r\nwith his cardinals in his protection of the Humanist movement. Eugene\r\nIV. (1431-47) was, if anything, more favourable, but yet his\r\nsympathies did not blind him to the dangerous tendencies of the\r\nrevival as manifested in the books of men like Beccadelli.[7]\r\n\r\nWith the election of Nicholas V. (1447-55)[8] the triumph of Humanism\r\nat Rome seemed secure. The new Pope was himself one of the party. As a\r\ntutor in Florence he had been brought into contact with the great\r\nliterary men of the time and had become an ardent student of the\r\nclassics, nor did his enthusiasm lose any of its ardour when he\r\nascended the Papal throne. His aim was to make Rome the intellectual\r\nas well as the religious capital of the world, and with this object in\r\nview he invited to his court the most distinguished scholars of the\r\nage, and bestowed upon not a few of them, such as Albergati,\r\nCapranica, and Caesarini the rank of cardinal. That he fully\r\nrecognised the advantages which religion might derive from the revival\r\nof letters, and that he aimed at employing the services of the\r\nHumanists in defence of Christianity is evident from the works to\r\nwhich he directed the attention of scholars. The texts of the\r\nScripture, the translations of the Greek Fathers, and the preparation\r\nof critical studies on the Lives of the Saints were amongst the works\r\nrecommended to his literary friends. At the same time he did not\r\nproclaim war upon the less orthodox of the Humanist school. Men like\r\nValla, Poggio, Filelfo, and Marsuppini were treated with friendliness\r\nand even with favour. Whether such a line of conduct was dictated by\r\nprudence and by the hope of winning over these scholars to a better\r\nunderstanding, or whether his anxiety for the success of his own\r\nliterary schemes blinded him to the serious excesses of such leaders\r\nit is difficult to say; but, at any rate, it serves to show the great\r\nliberty enjoyed by literary men at this period even in the very city\r\nof the Popes.\r\n\r\nAs a means of ensuring to Rome the most prominent place in the\r\nrevival, agents were dispatched to Greece, Turkey, Germany, France,\r\nand even to Sweden and Norway, to hunt for manuscripts. No expense was\r\nspared to secure everything that could be purchased or to have copies\r\nmade where purchase was impossible. In order to preserve these\r\ntreasures and make them available for scholars the Vatican Library was\r\nundertaken by orders of the Pope. Though long before this time the\r\nlibrary of the Popes was of considerable importance, yet on account of\r\nthe immense number of volumes produced by Nicholas V. he is generally\r\nregarded as the founder of the Vatican Library. The number of volumes\r\nwhich it contained at the time of his death is variously estimated at\r\nfrom one to nine thousand. The works of the Fathers of the Church, and\r\nthe Scholastics and Canonists were well represented.[9]\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Nicholas V. the Pagan side of the Humanist movement\r\nbecame more and more apparent. Pius II. (1458-64), who, as Aeneas\r\nSylvius, was well known as a clever writer of the Humanist school,\r\nseems as Pope to have been decidedly suspicious of his former friends.\r\nHis own private library was filled with Christian authors, and care\r\nwas taken to show favour only to those classical scholars whose\r\nwritings were above reproach. Yet the cares of his office and the\r\npromotion of the crusade on which he had set his heart prevented him\r\nfrom taking the necessary steps for the purification of his court,\r\nand, as a result, many of the members of the College of Abbreviators\r\nwere allowed to remain in office though they were really Pagan at\r\nheart. Paul II. could not tolerate such a state of affairs. He\r\npromptly abolished the College of Abbreviators, suppressed the Roman\r\nAcademy, and arrested its two prominent leaders, Pomponius Laetus and\r\nPlatina.\r\n\r\nIf Paul II. erred on the side of severity some of his successors went\r\nto the other extreme of laxity. The period of the political Popes,\r\nfrom Sixtus IV. to Julius II. (1471-1513), was marked by a serious\r\ndecline in the religious spirit, nor can it be said that the policy of\r\nthe Popes was calculated to check the downward tendency. Their\r\nattention was occupied too much by the politics of the petty Italian\r\nStates to permit them to fulfil the duties of their high office; and,\r\nas a consequence, the interests of religion were neglected. Sixtus IV.\r\nadopted the friendly attitude of Nicholas V. towards the Renaissance.\r\nThe College of Abbreviators was restored, the Roman Academy was\r\nrecognised, and Platina was appointed librarian. The manuscripts in\r\nthe Vatican Library were increased, more ample accommodation was\r\nprovided, and every facility was given to scholars to consult the\r\npapal collection. Hence it is that Sixtus IV. is regarded generally as\r\nthe second founder of the Vatican Library.\r\n\r\nThe revolutions and wars, caused by the invasion of Italy by the\r\nFrench and the Spaniards during the closing years of the fifteenth\r\ncentury and the early portion of the sixteenth, dealt a serious blow\r\nto Humanism in Florence, Milan, Venice, and other Italian centres. But\r\nthe misfortunes of those cities served to strengthen the movement at\r\nRome. Julius II. (1503-13) proved himself a generous patron of\r\nliterature and in a special manner of art. Men like Giuliano da\r\nSangello, Sansovino, Bramante, Michael Angelo, and Raphael were\r\ninvited to Rome and induced to devote their genius to the service of\r\nreligion and the glory of the Papacy. On the death of Julius II. in\r\n1513 the complete triumph of the Humanist movement in Rome was assured\r\nby the election of Giovanni de' Medici who took the name of Leo X.\r\n(1513-21).[10] As the son of Lorenzo the Magnificent, to whom Florence\r\nowes its literary renown, and as the pupil of the celebrated\r\nHumanists, Poliziano and Marsilio Ficino, he was committed almost of\r\nnecessity to the Humanist movement. Scholars and artists flocked to\r\nRome from all sides to greet the new Pope and to assure themselves of\r\nhis favour and protection. Under the new regime literary merit was the\r\nprincipal qualification sought for in candidates aspiring to the\r\nhighest ecclesiastical honours. The Roman University was reorganised;\r\nthe search for manuscripts was renewed with vigour; a new college for\r\nthe promotion of Greek studies in Rome was founded, and the services\r\nof Lascaris and Musuro were secured; and artists like Raphael and\r\nBramante received every encouragement. Humanism was at last triumphant\r\nin Rome, but, unfortunately, its triumph was secured at the expense of\r\nreligion. Nor was Humanism destined to enjoy the fruits of the victory\r\nfor a lengthened period. The outbreak of the Reformation and the\r\ncapture of Rome by the soldiers of Charles V. turned the attention of\r\nthe Popes to more pressing concerns.\r\n\r\nThe Renaissance movement in Germany is due largely to the influence of\r\nItalian scholars and to the teaching of the Brothers of the Common\r\nLife in their school at Deventer.[11] The close political relations\r\nexisting between the German States and the cities of Northern Italy,\r\nthe mission of Petrarch to the court of Charles IV., the intermingling\r\nof German and Italian scholars at the councils of Constance, Florence,\r\nand Basle, and the exertions of Aeneas Sylvius, afterwards Pius II.,\r\nduring his term of office as Chancellor of Frederick III., helped\r\nlargely to promote the study of the classics in Germany, especially\r\nwhen the invention and development of the art of printing had solved\r\nthe difficulty of procuring manuscripts. As in Italy, Humanism owes\r\nmuch of its success to the generosity of powerful patrons such as the\r\nEmperor Maximilian I., Frederick Elector of Saxony and his kinsman,\r\nDuke George, Joachim I. of Brandenburg, and Philip of the Palatinate,\r\nBishop John von Dalberg of Worms, and Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz;\r\nand as in Italy the academies were the most powerful means of\r\ndisseminating classical culture, so also in Germany learned societies\r\nlike the /Rhenana/, founded by Bishop Dalberg, and the /Danubiana/ in\r\nVienna, were most successful in promoting the literary propaganda.\r\n\r\nBut, unlike the Italian, the German revival was assisted largely by\r\nthe universities. Basle, Erfurt, Heidelburg, and Leipzig showed\r\nunmistakably their sympathy towards the movement, and in a short time\r\nthe programmes of university studies in nearly all the leading centres\r\nwere modified in accordance with the new ideas of education.\r\nScholasticism was obliged to make way for the classics and natural\r\nscience. Cologne, alone in Germany, refused to abandon its old system,\r\nand, though not unfriendly to the classics, as is evident by the\r\npresence of Ortwin Gratius on its list of professors, still it showed\r\nitself highly distrustful of the tendencies of some of the Humanist\r\nleaders. Yet German Humanism had little, if anything, in common with\r\nthe flagrant irreligion and immorality of the Italian school. With one\r\nor two exceptions German Humanists never assailed revealed religion as\r\nsuch, but attacked instead the prevailing educational system, which\r\nthey held to be responsible for the widespread ignorance and general\r\ndecline of the religious spirit. Many of the leading German scholars\r\nwere exemplary in their moral character and in their loyalty to the\r\nChurch, and few, even of those who were regarded as hostile, showed\r\nany sympathy with Luther once they understood that he aimed at revolt\r\nrather than reform.\r\n\r\nSome of the greatest of the German Humanists differed from their\r\nItalian contemporaries also in the fact that they turned the\r\nintellectual revival into scientific channels, and made the study of\r\nthe classics subservient to mathematical and astronomical research.\r\nCardinal Nicholas of Cusa (1400-64), George Peurbach of Vienna (d.\r\n1461), John Muller of Konigsberg (1436-76), better known by his Latin\r\nname Regiomontanus, and the great churchman and astronomer Copernicus\r\n(1473-1543) belonged to this section, which prepared the way for\r\nmodern scientific developments. With these men religion and science\r\nwent hand in hand.\r\n\r\nOn the purely literary side the most famous of the German Humanists\r\nwere Conrad Celtes (1459-1508) the most active of the promoters of the\r\nclassical revival beyond the Alps and one of the earliest of the\r\nGerman poets; Pirkeimer (1470-1528), who hoped for great things from\r\nthe Lutheran movement at first, but having realised its real nature\r\nremained loyal to the Church; Mutianus Rufus (1471-1526), a canon of\r\nGotha and at the same time a well-known free-thinker; Grotus Rubeanus\r\n(1480-1504), who at first favoured Luther; Jakob Wimpheling (1450-\r\n1528), and Johannes Trithemius (1462-1516), the learned historian and\r\nabbot of Sponheim; Ulrich von Hutten (1488-1523), and Johann Reuchlin\r\n(1455-1522).\r\n\r\nOf these the most important from the point of view of ecclesiastical\r\nhistory are von Hutten[12] and Reuchlin. The former was born in the\r\nyear 1488 and was sent for his education to the monastery of Fulda,\r\nfrom which he fled with very little mental equipment except a lasting\r\nhatred and distrust for all monks and ecclesiastics. As a wandering\r\nstudent he visited the leading centres of learning in Germany and\r\nNorthern Italy, where he was particularly remarkable for his dissolute\r\nlife, his ungovernable temper, and his biting sarcasm. Taking\r\nadvantage of the rising spirit of unfriendliness between the Teuton\r\nand the Latin countries, he posed as a patriot burning with love for\r\nGermany and the Germans, and despising the French, the Italians, and\r\nin particular the Pope. Against the monks and theologians he directed\r\nhis bitterest satires, to the delight of many, who did not foresee the\r\ndangers of such attacks at a time when the German nation generally was\r\ngrowing less friendly to the Papacy.\r\n\r\nA dispute, which broke out about the destruction or suppression of\r\nJewish books, afforded him a splendid opportunity of venting his\r\nspleen against the Church. A converted Jew of Cologne named\r\nPfefferkorn advocated the suppression of all Jewish religious books\r\nexcept the Old Testament, as the best means of converting his former\r\nco-religionists. The Emperor, Maximilian, was not unwilling to listen\r\nto such advice supported as it was by the universities of Cologne,\r\nMainz, and Erfut. Reuchlin, a professor of Heidelberg and himself a\r\nwell-known Hebrew scholar, opposed such a policy as bad in itself and\r\nas injurious to the proper understanding of the Old Testament. A warm\r\ncontroversy thereupon ensued. The Dominicans of Cologne espoused the\r\ncause of Pfefferkorn, while the Humanists, scenting in the attack upon\r\nJewish literature an onslaught directed against the entire literary\r\nrevival, supported the contentions of Reuchlin. It was a war between\r\ntwo opposing schools--the Theologians and the Humanists; and,\r\nunfortunately for the Theologians, they had selected their ground\r\nbadly, and were but poorly equipped for a battle in which victory was\r\nto be decided by popular opinion.\r\n\r\nReuchlin was summoned to appear before the Inquisitor to answer for\r\nthe views put forward in his /Augenspeigel/ (1511), and was condemned.\r\nHe appealed to Rome, and the Bishop of Speier was ordered to\r\ninvestigate the case. The result was the acquittal of Reuchlin (1514),\r\nbut his adversaries, having objected to the mode of trial, the case\r\nwas transferred once more to the Roman courts. Meanwhile the\r\ncontroversy was carried on in Germany with great bitterness. Reuchlin\r\npublished a volume of sympathetic letters[13] received by him from the\r\nleading scholars of Germany, and Erasmus issued a new edition (1515)\r\nof his /Praise of Folly (Encomium Moriae)/ in which he ridiculed\r\nespecially the monks and theologians.\r\n\r\nBut the book which was most damaging to the opponents of Humanism was\r\nbeyond doubt the /Epistolae virorum obscurorum/. It was a work\r\nconsisting of two volumes, the first brought out by Grotus Rubeanus in\r\n1514, and the second mostly from the pen of Urich von Hutten (1517).\r\nLike Reuchlin's work it purported to be a collection of letters\r\naddressed by the theologians to Ortwin Gratius, the champion of\r\nCologne university and, indeed, of the whole Scholastic party. It was\r\nfull of bitterness and vulgarity, but, as a humorous caricature of the\r\ntheologians, their arguments and modes of expression, it was\r\ncalculated to make them ridiculous especially in the eyes of the\r\nuniversity students. Against an attack of this kind serious arguments\r\nwere unavailing, and, unfortunately, there was no apologist of\r\ntheology capable of producing a reply couched in a strain similar to\r\nthat of the /Epistolae/. Gratius himself did undertake the task in his\r\n/Lamentationes obscurorum virorum/, but without success, and\r\nundoubtedly in the eyes of the general public the victory rested with\r\nthe Humanists. The whole controversy was extremely unfortunate,\r\nbecause it helped to blind many to the real issues at stake when the\r\nLutheran movement began. By it the Theologians and Humanists were\r\ndivided into two hostile camps, with the result that the latter were\r\ninclined to support Luther against their own former opponents and in\r\nvindication of the liberal policy which they had advocated; while the\r\nTheologian, having been discredited as narrow-minded obscurantists in\r\nthe eyes of a large body of university men, were handicapped seriously\r\nin a struggle with Luther even though their struggle was for\r\nfundamental religious principles.[14]\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable of the men, who, though not Germans, were closely\r\nidentified with German Humanists, was Desiderius Erasmus (1466-\r\n1535).[15] He was born at Rotterdam, was sent to school with the\r\nBrothers of the Common Life at Deventer, entered a monastery of the\r\nCanons Regular attracted by its library rather than by its rule, and\r\nleft it after two years to become secretary to the Bishop of Cambrai.\r\nHe studied classics at the University of Paris, and after his\r\nordination as priest by the Bishop of Utrecht he became a tutor to an\r\nEnglish nobleman. Later on he paid a visit to England, where he\r\nreceived a warm welcome from scholars like Fisher, Bishop of\r\nRochester, Colet, Dean of St. Paul's, and Sir Thomas More, and where\r\nhe was honoured by an appointment as Professor of Greek in Oxford. But\r\nthe fever of travel was upon him. He returned to Paris, made a brief\r\nstay at Louvain, and started out to visit the leading literary centres\r\nof Italy, notably Bologna, Venice, and Rome, in the latter of which he\r\nwas well received by Julius II.\r\n\r\nOn the accession of Henry VIII. he returned to England and lectured\r\nfor some time at Cambridge. Later on he removed to Basle and settled\r\ndown to the work of preparing editions of the New Testament and of the\r\nFathers. The triumph of the Reformation party in Basle drove him for a\r\ntime to seek a refuge in Freiburg, but he returned to die at Basle in\r\n1536.\r\n\r\nIn his wanderings Erasmus was brought into contact with the leading\r\nscholars of France, England, Germany, and Italy, and was thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the lights and shadows of the Renaissance movement. In\r\nhis knowledge of Greek he was surpassed by few of his contemporaries,\r\nand in the purity and ease of his Latin style he stood without a\r\nserious rival. Like many others of the Humanist school he delighted in\r\nattacking the ignorance of the monks and Scholastics, and in\r\ndenouncing the abuses of the age, though, as was the case with most of\r\nthe literary reformers of the time, his own life as an ecclesiastic\r\nwas far from exemplary.\r\n\r\nYet Erasmus himself was never an enemy of Christianity, nor did he\r\ndesire the overthrow of ecclesiastical authority. He did, indeed,\r\nadvocate reform, and in his advocacy of reform he may have been\r\ncarried too far at times, but in his heart Erasmus had little sympathy\r\nwith doctrinal changes. Ignorance he believed to be at the root of the\r\ndecline of religion, and hence he would have welcomed a complete\r\nchange in the educational system of the Church. Instead of\r\nScholasticism he advocated study of the Scriptures and of the early\r\nFathers, and in order to prepare the way for such a policy he devoted\r\nhimself at Basle to the task of preparing an edition of the New\r\nTestament and of the Greek Fathers. He was on terms of the closest\r\nintimacy with the leading Humanists of Germany, and shared all their\r\ncontempt for scholastic theologians and much of their distrust of the\r\nPope and the Roman Curia. Hence the sympathy and encouragement of\r\nErasmus were not wanting to Luther during the early days of his revolt\r\nand before the true object of the movement was rightly understood; but\r\nonce Erasmus realised that union with Luther meant separation from the\r\nChurch he became more reserved in his approval, and finally took the\r\nfield against him. In his work, /De Libero Arbitrio/, he opposed the\r\nteaching of Luther on free will, and before his death he received a\r\nbenefice from Paul III. which he accepted, and an offer of a\r\ncardinal's hat which he declined. His life as an ecclesiastic was\r\ncertainly not edifying, and his hatred of ignorance, antiquated\r\neducational methods, and abuses may have led him into excesses, but\r\nhis theology was still the theology of the Middle Ages rather than\r\nthat of the German Reformers.\r\n\r\nIn France the earliest of the Humanists were Nicholas of Clemanges and\r\nGerson, both rectors of Paris University, and both well-known\r\ntheologians. They were specially active in putting an end to the Great\r\nWestern Schism, but in doing so they laid down certain principles that\r\nled almost inevitably to Gallicanism. The influence of these two men\r\ndid not, however, change the policy of Paris University. For years\r\nFrance lagged behind in the classical movement, and it was only in the\r\nearly portion of the sixteenth century that French Humanism made\r\nitself felt.\r\n\r\nThe movement gained ground by the exertions of individuals and of\r\nliterary societies, by the results of the activity of the printing\r\npress, and the protection of influential patrons at the Court of\r\nFrancis I. (1515-47). Paris University became more friendly to the\r\nclassics, and eminent scholars like Lascaris and Aleandro were invited\r\nto lecture on Greek. The College of St. Barbe became a great classical\r\nstronghold within the university, and the movement began to develop so\r\nrapidly as to excite the jealousy and suspicions of the theologians.\r\nThis unfortunate division was rendered more acute by the foundation of\r\nthe College de France in 1529. It was handed over entirely to the\r\nHumanistic party in spite of the opposition of the more conservative\r\nschool, and served as a centre for all kinds of literary,\r\nphilological, and antiquarian researches.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent of the French Humanists were Budaeus (1467-1540),\r\nregarded in his own time as but slightly inferior to Erasmus, Germanus\r\nBrixius (Germain de Brie), Canon of Notre Dame and translator of\r\nportion of the works of St. John Chrysostom, Stephen Poncher, Bishop\r\nof Paris and advocate of the Humanist party at the Court of Francis\r\nI., the Dominican, William Petit, Robert (1503-59) and Henri (1528-98)\r\nEstienne (Stephanus) to whom we are indebted for the two monumental\r\nworks, /Thesaurus Linguae Latinae/ and /Linguae Graecae/, Scaliger\r\n(1540-1609) the well-known authority on chronology and epigraphy, and\r\nthe philologist and classicist Isaac Casaubon (1559-1614).\r\n\r\nIn France there was a sharp rivalry from the beginning between the\r\nScholastics and the Humanists. The university was divided into\r\nseparate camps. The college of St. Barbe was opposed by the Montaigue\r\nCollege, the rector of which was the leader of the Scholastic party.\r\nThe Humanists regarded the Theologians as antiquated, while the\r\nTheologians looked upon their opponents as supporters of the\r\nReformation movement. In case of a few of these, as for example\r\nLefevre d'Etaples,[16] Gerard Roussel, and others, these suspicions\r\nwere fully justified; but in case of many others their faith was\r\nsound, and however much they may have wavered in life they preferred\r\nto die at peace with the Church. To this latter section belongs\r\nMarguerite of Valois,[17] sister of Francis I. She was a patroness of\r\nthe Humanists and Reformers in Paris and was opposed undoubtedly to\r\nmany Catholic practices; but it is not so clear that she wished for a\r\nreligious revolution, and at any rate it is certain that she died a\r\nCatholic. This rivalry between the Theologians and Humanists and the\r\nmisunderstandings to which it gave rise are largely responsible for\r\nthe rapid development of Calvinism amongst certain classes of French\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThe classical movement in England is due largely to Italian\r\ninfluences, though the visit of the Greek Emperor Manuel in 1400, and\r\nthe subsequent visits of Greek envoys and scholars must have\r\ncontributed not a little to awaken an interest among English students\r\nin Greek studies. Individual Englishmen began to turn towards the\r\ngreat centres of Italian Humanism, and to return to their own country\r\nimbued with something of the literary zeal of their Italian masters.\r\nOf these the two who, more than others, contributed to give Greek and\r\nLatin a good standing in the schools of the country were William\r\nSelling and William Hadley, both Benedictine monks of Canterbury. They\r\nstudied at Bologna, Padua and Rome, and were brought into contact with\r\nPolitian and other distinguished Humanists. Selling was recognised as\r\nan accomplished Greek scholar, and on his return he set himself to\r\nremodel the course of studies at Canterbury so as to ensure for the\r\nclassics their proper place. The influence of Canterbury and of Prior\r\nSelling helped very much to spread the classical revival in England.\r\n\r\nSelling's most remarkable pupil was Thomas Linacre (1460-1524), who\r\nwent to Oxford after having completed his early education at\r\nCanterbury, and was chosen Fellow of All Soul's College. Later on he\r\naccompanied his old master to Italy, where he had an opportunity of\r\nmastering the intricacies of Latin style from Politian, the tutor of\r\nthe children of Lorenzo de' Medici, and of Greek from Demetrius\r\nChalcondylas. He turned his attention to medicine and received a\r\ndegree both at Padua and Oxford. His position at the courts of Henry\r\nVII. and Henry VIII. gave him an opportunity of enlisting the\r\nsympathies of the leading ecclesiastical and lay scholars of his day\r\nin favour of the literary revival. In his later years he was ordained\r\npriest and held some important ecclesiastical offices. Other\r\ndistinguished scholars and patrons of the revival in England were\r\nGrocyn, a companion of Linacre at Oxford and in Italy and afterwards\r\nlecturer on Greek at Exeter College, Oxford; John Colet (1467-1519),\r\nDean of St. Paul's, the friend of Budaeus, Erasmus, Linacre, and\r\nGrocyn, and founder of St. Paul's School; William Lilly, appointed by\r\nDean Colet as first master in this school; Fisher (1459-1535) Bishop\r\nof Rochester; and Sir Thomas More (1480-1535).\r\n\r\nThe Humanist movement in England, unlike the corresponding movement in\r\nItaly, was in no sense hostile to religion or to the Catholic Church.\r\nMany of its leaders desired reform, but not a single one of the\r\nprominent scholars of the period showed any sympathy with Luther's\r\nrevolt. The very founders of the revival in England, Selling, Hadley,\r\nLinacre and Grocyn, were ecclesiastics whose faith was beyond\r\nsuspicion; Colet died as he had lived, thoroughly devoted to the\r\nChurch; while Fisher and Sir Thomas More sealed their loyalty to the\r\nancient faith with their blood.[18]\r\n\r\nThe revival in Spain owes much to the patronage of Queen Isabella and\r\nthe exertions of Cardinal Ximenez (1436-1517). The leading\r\nuniversities, Seville, Alcala, and Salamanca, were not unfriendly, and\r\nthe whole educational system was remodelled in favour of the classics.\r\nCardinal Ximenez devoted himself to the preparation of the Polyglot\r\nedition of the Bible, the New Testament portion of which was printed\r\nso early as 1514, and the whole work was published in 1522. The\r\nleading Humanist scholars were Lebrixa, or as he is called in Latin\r\nLebrissensis, Nunez, and Ludovico Vives (1492-1540), the latter of\r\nwhom was deemed by his contemporaries not unworthy of being compared\r\nwith Erasmus and Budaeus.\r\n\r\nThe Humanist movement and the general revival of literary, scientific,\r\nphilological and historical studies to which it gave birth were not in\r\nthemselves anti-religious, nor did they find in the Catholic Church a\r\ndetermined opponent. Such studies, on the contrary, might have\r\ncontributed much to promote a more enlightened understanding of\r\ntheology, and more especially of the Scriptures, a fact which was\r\nunderstood thoroughly by the ablest ecclesiastics of the time. In\r\nItaly, Germany, France, and England, bishops and abbots vied with\r\nsecular princes in their patronage of scholars, while the influence of\r\nthe Popes, notably Nicholas V., Sixtus IV., Julius II., and Leo X. was\r\nentirely in favour of the Humanist party.\r\n\r\nYet, while all this is true, the Humanist movement did much,\r\nundoubtedly, to prepare men's minds for the great religious revolt of\r\nthe sixteenth century. Springing into life as it did at a time when\r\nthe faith of the Middle Ages was on the wane, and when many educated\r\nmen were growing tired of the cold formalism and antiquated methods of\r\nthe Schoolmen, it tended to develop a spirit of restless inquiry that\r\ncould ill brook any restriction. The return to the classics recalled\r\nmemories of an earlier civilisation and culture opposed in many\r\nparticulars to the genius of Christianity, and the return of nature\r\ntended to push into the background the supernatural idea upon which\r\nthe Christian religion is based. But the revival did more. The study\r\nof the classics brought into prominence serious problems regarding the\r\nauthenticity, age, and value of certain writings and manuscripts, and\r\nby so doing it created a spirit of criticism and of doubt for which\r\nthe Theologians of the day were but poorly prepared. In a word, it was\r\na period of transition and of intellectual unrest, when new ideals in\r\neducation were endeavouring to supplant the old ones, and when neither\r\nthe friends of the old nor of the new had distinguished clearly\r\nbetween what was essential in Christianity and what was purely\r\naccidental.\r\n\r\nIn such a time it was to be expected that ardent Humanists, filled\r\nwith their new-born zeal for classical studies, should advance too\r\nrapidly, and by confounding religion with the crude methods of some of\r\nits defenders should jump to the conclusion that a reconciliation\r\nbetween the revival and religion was impossible. Nor should it be a\r\nmatter of surprise that the Theologians, confident in the strength of\r\ntheir own position and naturally suspicious of intellectual novelties,\r\nwere not inclined to look with favour on a movement which owed its\r\ninspiration largely to Pagan sources. Moderate men, on the contrary,\r\nwhether Humanists or Scholastics, aimed at a complete reconciliation.\r\nThey realised that the great literary and scientific revival could do\r\nmuch for the defence of religion, and that the Pagan classics must be\r\nappraised according to Christian standards.\r\n\r\nBut this work of reconciliation was rendered very difficult by the\r\nattitude of extremists on both sides. Many of the Italian Humanists,\r\nas has been shown, were Christians only in name. In their writings and\r\nin their lives they showed clearly that they were thoroughly imbued\r\nwith the spirit of Paganism. Such men merited severe condemnation, and\r\nit is to be regretted that the Popes, particularly Sixtus IV. and Leo\r\nX., did not adopt a firmer attitude towards this section of the\r\nItalian school. But before judging too harshly the friendly relations\r\nmaintained by Sixtus IV. and Leo X. with the Italian Humanists, it is\r\nwell to remember that the age in which they lived was noted for its\r\ngeneral laxity and for the decline of a proper religious spirit, that\r\nthe Pagan tone and Pagan forms of expression used by these writers\r\nwere regarded as exhibitions of harmless pedantry rather than as clear\r\nproofs of opposition to Christianity, that most of these writers were\r\nalways ready to explain away whatever might appear objectionable in\r\ntheir works, and that, finally, mildness in the circumstances may have\r\nbeen deemed the best policy. The attitude of the Popes at any rate\r\nprevented an open conflict between the representatives of the two\r\nschools in Italy until the outbreak of the Reformation and the\r\ninvasion of Rome put an end to the danger by destroying the Humanist\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nIn Germany and France there were few traces of an anti-Christian\r\ntendency amongst the supporters of the new learning. But in both\r\ncountries, more especially in the former, the supporters of the new\r\nlearning criticised severely the ignorance of the monks and\r\nTheologians, and took little pains to conceal their contempt for the\r\nScholastic methods of education. They blamed the Popes for their\r\nneglect of the true interests of the Church, and held them responsible\r\nin a large measure for the general decline of religion. According to\r\nthem the study of theology must be reformed so as to give a more\r\nprominent place to the Scriptures and the writings of the early\r\nFathers; the development of the internal spirit of religion as\r\ndistinct from mere external formalism was to be encouraged, and many\r\nof the existing practices might be discarded as superstitious. Such\r\nviews tended naturally to excite the opposition of the Theologians and\r\nto unsettle the religious convictions of educated men who watched the\r\nstruggle with indifference.\r\n\r\nIn this way the ground was prepared for a complete religious revolt.\r\nLuther's movement was regarded by many as merely the logical sequence\r\nof Humanism, but that the Humanists themselves were not willing to\r\naccept this view is clear from the fact that once the early\r\nmisunderstandings had been removed, and once the real issues were\r\napparent, most of the Humanists in Germany and France remained true to\r\nthe Church. Instead of regarding Luther as a friend they looked upon\r\nhim as the worst enemy of their cause, and on the Reformation as the\r\ndeath-knell of the Renaissance.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] Sandys, /History of Classical Scholarship/, 2nd edition, 1906.\r\n    Rogers, /L'Enseignement des lettres classiques d'Ausone a Alcuin/,\r\n    1905.

A new tendency began to make itself felt in European\r\npolitics. Hitherto the feudal system, on which society was based, had\r\nserved as a barrier against the development of royal power or the\r\nformation of united states. Under this system the king was sometimes\r\nless powerful than some of his nominal subjects, and was entirely\r\ndependent upon the good-will of the barons for the success of any\r\naction he might take outside his own hereditary dominions. This was\r\nthe real weakness of the system, and so long as it remained the growth\r\nof Nationalism was impossible.\r\n\r\nGradually, however, by the exertions of powerful sovereigns the power\r\nof the barons was broken, the smaller states were swallowed up in the\r\nlarger ones, and the way was prepared for the rise of the nations of\r\nModern Europe. In France the policy of centralisation begun in the\r\nthirteenth century, was carried to a successful conclusion in the days\r\nof Louis XI. (1461-83). The English provinces, Aquitane, Burgundy, and\r\nBrittany, were all united to form one state, knowing only one supreme\r\nruler. In Spain the old divisions disappeared almost completely with\r\nthe union of Castile and Aragon under Ferdinand (1479-1516) and\r\nIsabella the Catholic (1474-1504), and with the complete destruction\r\nof the Moorish power by the conquest of Granada (1492). In England the\r\nslaughter of the nobility in the Wars of the Roses left the way ready\r\nfor the establishment of the Tudor dominion. As part of the same\r\nmovement towards unification Henry VIII. was declared to be King of\r\nIreland instead of Feudal Lord, and serious attempts were made to\r\ninclude Scotland within his dominions. Inside the Empire similar\r\ntendencies were at work, but with exactly opposite results. The\r\ninterregnum in the Empire and a succession of weak rulers left the\r\nterritorial princes free to imitate the rulers of Europe by\r\nstrengthening their own power at the expense of the lower nobility,\r\nthe cities, and the peasantry; but, having secured themselves, they\r\nused their increased strength to arrest the progress of centralisation\r\nand to prevent the development of a strong imperial power.\r\n\r\nAs a direct result of this centralisation tendency and of the increase\r\nin royal authority that it involved, the rulers of Europe initiated a\r\ncampaign against all constitutional restrictions on the exercise of\r\ntheir authority. The feudal system with all its faults was in some\r\nsenses wonderfully democratic. The sovereign was dependent upon the\r\ndecisions of the various representative assemblies; and though the\r\nlower classes had little voice except in purely local affairs, yet the\r\nrights and privileges of all classes were hedged round so securely by\r\nwritten charters or immemorial usage that any infringement of them\r\nmight be attended with serious results. In England the Parliament, in\r\nSpain the Cortes, in France the States General, and in Germany the\r\nDiet, should have proved a strong barrier against absolute rule. But\r\nthe authority of such assemblies was soon weakened or destroyed. Under\r\nthe Tudors the English Parliament became a mere machine for\r\nregistering the wishes of the sovereign; the Cortes and States General\r\nwere rarely consulted in Spain and France; and, though the Diet\r\nretained its position in the Empire, it was used rather to increase\r\nthe influence of the princes than to afford any guarantee of liberty\r\nto the subject.\r\n\r\nIn bringing about such a complete revolution the rulers were assisted\r\nlargely by the introduction of the Roman Code of Justinian.[1]\r\nAccording to the principles of the Roman Code the power of the\r\nsovereign was unlimited, and against his wishes no traditional customs\r\nor privileges could prevail. Such a system was detested especially by\r\nthe Germans, who clung with great pertinacity to their own national\r\nlaws and customs; but the princes, supported by the universities,\r\ncarried through the reform on which they had set their heart. They\r\nsucceeded in strengthening their own power and in trampling down the\r\nrights guaranteed to their subjects by the old Germanic Code, while at\r\nthe same time they were untiring in their resistance to imperial\r\nreforms, and were unwilling to do anything to increase the power of\r\nthe Emperor.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the development of arbitrary rule the lower classes had\r\ngreat reason to complain of the increase of taxation and of the\r\ndifficulties of obtaining justice in the ordinary courts of law. They\r\nwere ready to listen to the advice of interested leaders, who urged\r\nthem to band together in defence of their rights against the\r\nusurpation of land owners and kings. As a result nearly every country\r\nin Europe found itself involved in a great struggle. The Peasants' War\r\nin Hungary (1514), the revolt against Charles V. in Spain (1520), the\r\nresistance of the Flemish Communes, led by Ghent, to the ordinances of\r\nthe Dukes of Burgundy, the discontent of the lower classes in France\r\nwith the excessive taxes levied by Louis XI., and the secret\r\nassociations which prepared the way for the great uprising of the\r\nlower classes in Germany (1524), were clear indications that\r\noppression and discontent were not confined to any particular country\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\nWith all these political developments the interests of religion and of\r\nthe Church were closely connected. Even though it be admitted that in\r\nthemselves there is no real opposition between Nationalism and\r\nCatholicism, yet in the circumstances of the time, when national\r\nrivalry was acute, the dependence of the Holy See upon any particular\r\nnation was certain to excite serious jealousy. From that time nations\r\nbegan to regard the Pope as an ally or an enemy according to the side\r\nhe favoured instead of looking to him as a common father, and\r\nconsequently the danger of a conflict between national patriotism and\r\nloyalty to the Head of the Church was rendered less improbable. This\r\nfeeling was increased by the residence of the Popes at Avignon, when\r\nthe Holy See was so completely associated with the interests of\r\nFrance, and by the policy pursued by Sixtus IV. and his successors in\r\nregard to the Italian States. Nowhere, however, was this opposition to\r\nthe Papacy manifested more clearly than in Germany. This was due\r\npartly to the growing feeling of antipathy between the Teutonic and\r\nthe Latin races, partly to the tradition of the great struggle of the\r\nthirteenth century in which the Emperors were worsted by the Popes,\r\nand partly also to the discontent excited amongst all classes of the\r\nGerman people, lay and cleric, by the taxations of the Curia. The\r\nattitude of the three ecclesiastical electors in 1455, the complaints\r\nof the clergy in 1479, and the list of /Gravamina/ presented to\r\nMaximilian in 1510 were harbingers of the revolution that was to come.\r\n\r\nBesides, the growth of absolutism in Europe was likely to prove\r\ndangerous to the liberties of the Church. Rulers, who aimed at\r\nsecuring for themselves unlimited authority, were not blind to the\r\nimportance of being able to control the ecclesiastical organisation,\r\nand to attain this result their legal advisers quoted for them the\r\nmaxims of the old Roman Code, according to which the king was the\r\nsource of all spiritual as well as temporal power. Their predecessors\r\nhad usurped already a strong voice in the appointments to benefices,\r\nbut now civil rulers claimed as a right what those who had gone before\r\nwere glad to accept as a privilege. Hence they demanded that the Holy\r\nSee should hand over to them the nomination of bishops, that it should\r\nmodify the old laws regarding exemption of ecclesiastical property\r\nfrom taxation, trial of clerics, and right of sanctuary, and that it\r\nshould submit its pronouncements for the royal /Exequator/ before they\r\ncould have the force of law in any particular state. The Pragmatic\r\nSanction of Bourges (1438) and the Concordat wrung from Leo X. by\r\nFrancis I. of France in 1516, the Concordat of Princes in 1447, and\r\nthe new demands formulated by the Diet of the Empire, the Statutes of\r\n/Provisors/ and /Praemunire/ in England (1453), and the concessions\r\ninsisted upon by Ferdinand and Isabella in Spain (1482), were clear\r\nproofs that absolutism was destined to prove fatal to the liberty of\r\nthe Church and the authority of the Holy See.\r\n\r\nFinally, the universal discontent of the masses, and the great social\r\nrevolutions of the first quarter of the sixteenth century were likely\r\nto prove dangerous to ecclesiastical authority. In all revolutions the\r\nmost extreme men are certain to assume control at least in the earlier\r\nstages of the movement, and their wildest onslaughts on Church and\r\nState are sure to receive the applause of the crowd. But there was\r\nspecial danger that these popular outbreaks might be turned into anti-\r\nreligious channels at a time when so many of the bishops were secular\r\nprinces, and when the Church appeared to be so closely identified with\r\nthe very interests against which the peasants took up arms. In these\r\ncircumstances it was not difficult for designing men to push forward\r\ntheir plans of a religious reform under guise of a campaign for\r\nliberty and equality.[2]\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] /Cambridge Modern History/, ii., p. 176.

The\r\nAvignon Popes were Frenchmen themselves. Their cardinals and officials\r\nbelonged for the most part to the same favoured nation. They were\r\ndependent upon the King of France for protection, and in return, their\r\nrevenues were at times placed at his disposal in order to ensure\r\nvictory for the French banners. Such a state of affairs was certain to\r\nalienate the rulers and people of other nations, especially of Germany\r\nand England, and to prepare the way for a possible conflict in the\r\ndays that were to come.\r\n\r\nThe Great Western Schism that followed upon the residence at Avignon\r\ndivided Christian Europe into hostile camps, and snapped the bond of\r\nunity which was already strained to the utmost by political and\r\nnational rivalries. Sincere believers were scandalised at the\r\nspectacle of two or three rival Popes, each claiming to be the\r\nsuccessor of St. Peter, and hurling at his opponents and their\r\nsupporters the severest censures of the Church. While the various\r\nclaimants to the Papacy were contending for supreme power in the\r\nChurch, they were obliged to make concession after concession to the\r\nrulers who supported them and to permit them to interfere in religious\r\naffairs, so that even when peace was restored and when Martin V. was\r\nuniversally recognised as the lawful Pope, he found himself deprived\r\nof many of the rights and prerogatives, for which his predecessors\r\nfrom Gregory VII. to Boniface VIII. had struggled so bravely.\r\n\r\nNor was this all. In their efforts to bring about a reunion, and\r\ndespairing of arriving at this happy result by an agreement among the\r\ncontending Popes, many honest theologians put forward principles,\r\nwhich, however suitable to the circumstances of the schism, were\r\nutterly subversive of the monarchical constitution of the Church. They\r\nmaintained that in case of doubtful Popes the cardinals had the right\r\nto summon a General Council to decide the issue, and that all\r\nChristians were bound to submit to its decrees. In accordance with\r\nthese principles the Council of Constance was convoked, and, elated\r\nwith the success of this experiment, many of the more ardent spirits\r\nseemed determined to replace, or at least, to limit the authority of\r\nthe Popes by the authority of General Councils summoned at regular\r\nintervals. The Pope was to be no longer supreme spiritual ruler. His\r\nposition in the Church was to be rather the position of a\r\nconstitutional sovereign in a state, the General Council being for the\r\nPope what modern Parliaments are for the king.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the Popes such a theory was completely discredited by\r\nthe excesses of its supporters at the Council of Basle, but it served\r\nto weaken the authority of the Holy See, and to put into the hands of\r\nits opponents a weapon which they were not slow to wield whenever\r\ntheir personal interests were affected. Henceforth appeals from the\r\nPope to a General Council, although prohibited, were by no means\r\nunfrequent.\r\n\r\nYet in spite of all these reverses, had the Church been blessed with a\r\nsuccession of worthy Popes burning with zeal for religion, free to\r\ndevote themselves to a thorough reform, and capable of understanding\r\nthe altered political and social conditions of the world, the Papacy\r\nmight have been restored to its old position. But unfortunately the\r\nPopes from Nicholas V. to Leo X. were not the men to repair the damage\r\nthat was done, or to ward off impending danger. The calamities that\r\nthreatened Europe from the advance of the Turks, and the necessity of\r\nrousing its rulers to a sense of their responsibilities occupied a\r\nlarge share of their attention; while the anxiety which they displayed\r\nin the miserable squabbles of the Italian kingdoms, sometimes out of\r\ndisinterested regard for the temporal States of the Church, as in the\r\ncase of Julius II., more frequently from a desire of providing\r\nterritories for their unworthy relations, left them little time to\r\nsafeguard the general well-being of the Church. In case of some of\r\nthem, too, if one may judge them by their actions, the progress of\r\nHumanism seemed to be nearer to their hearts than the progress of\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nIn his personal life Nicholas V. (1447-55) was not unworthy of his\r\nexalted position, but the necessity of repairing the damage that had\r\nbeen done by the unruly assembly at Basle, which arrogated to itself\r\nthe authority of an independent General Council, the removal of the\r\nlast obstacle to the Turkish invasion of Europe in the fall of\r\nConstantinople, and the importance of securing for Rome a pre-eminent\r\nposition in the great classical revival, engaged all his energies to\r\nthe exclusion of necessary reforms. Calixtus III. (1455-58) was too\r\nold to do much, yet, notwithstanding his advancing years and the\r\nindifference of the European rulers, he threw himself into the\r\nstruggle against the Turks, aiding and encouraging Hungary and Albania\r\nin their resistance, and it is due largely to his efforts that the\r\nvictorious advance of Mahomet II. was checked by the overthrow of his\r\nforces at Belgrade (1456). Pius II.[1] (1458-64), though in his youth\r\nnot the most exemplary of the Humanist school, devoted himself with\r\nearnestness and zeal to the duties of his sacred office. He published\r\na Bull retracting all the attacks which he had made against the Papacy\r\nin his capacity as secretary to the /Concilabulum/ at Basle. He set\r\nhimself to study the Scriptures and the early Fathers in place of the\r\nPagan classics, and he showed his approbation of the Christian\r\nHumanists. But he was unable to undertake the work of reform. In view\r\nof the danger that still threatened Europe he convoked an assembly of\r\nthe princes at Mantua to organise a crusade against the Turks, but\r\nthey turned a deaf ear to his appeals, and, at last weary of their\r\nrefusals and indifference, he determined to place himself at the head\r\nof the Christian forces for the defence of Europe and Christianity. He\r\nreached Ancona broken down in spirits and bodily health, and died\r\nbefore anything effective could be done. Paul II. (1464-71), who\r\nsucceeded, made some efforts to purify the Roman Court. He suppressed\r\npromptly the College of Abbreviators who were noted for their greed\r\nfor gold and their zeal for Paganism, and closed the Roman Academy. On\r\naccount of his severity in dealing with the half Christian Humanists\r\nof the Curia he has been attacked with savage bitterness by Platina,\r\none of the dismissed officials, in his /Lives of the Popes/,[2] but\r\nnobody is likely to be deceived by scurrilous libels, the motives of\r\nwhich are only too apparent. The worst that can be said against Paul\r\nII. is that he was too fond of appointing his relatives to high\r\npositions in the Church; but in mitigation of that it is well to\r\nremember that his reforms had raised up so many enemies against him in\r\nRome, and disaffection was so rife amongst even the highest officials\r\nof his court, that he may have deemed it prudent to have relatives\r\naround him on whom he could rely.\r\n\r\nSixtus IV. (1471-84) was the first of the political Popes, Leo X.\r\nbeing the last. They are so called on account of the excessive\r\ninterest they displayed in Italian politics of the period, to the\r\nneglect of the higher interests with which they were entrusted. Most\r\nof them, with the exception of Alexander VI., were not positively\r\nunworthy men, but they were too much concerned with secular pursuits\r\nto undertake a reform of the gross abuses which flourished at the very\r\ngates of their palace. The papal court was no worse and very little\r\nbetter than the courts of contemporary rulers, and the greed for\r\nmoney, which was the predominant weakness of the curial officials,\r\nalienated the sympathy of all foreigners, both lay and cleric.\r\n\r\nJulius II. (1503-13) did, indeed, undertake the difficult task of\r\nrestoring the States of the Church that had been parcelled out into\r\npetty kingdoms by his predecessors, but his policy soon brought him\r\ninto conflict with Louis XII. of France. Louis demanded that a General\r\nCouncil should be convoked, not so much out of zeal for reform as from\r\na desire to embarrass the Pope, and when Julius II. refused to comply\r\nwith his request the king induced some of the rebellious cardinals to\r\nissue invitations for a council to meet at Pisa (Sept. 1511). Most of\r\nthe bishops who met at Pisa at the appointed time were from France.\r\nThe Emperor Maximilian held aloof, and the people of Pisa regarded the\r\nconventicle with no friendly feelings. The sessions were transferred\r\nfrom Pisa to Milan, and finally to Lyons. As a set off to this Julius\r\nII. convoked a council to meet at Rome, the fifth Lateran Council (May\r\n1512), for the threefold purpose of healing the French schism, of\r\nproscribing certain doctrinal errors, and of undertaking the work of\r\nreform. The earlier sessions were taken up almost entirely with the\r\nschism, and before the work of reform was begun Julius II. passed\r\naway.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by the young and learned John de' Medici, son of\r\nLorenzo the Magnificent of Florence, who took the name of Leo X.\r\n(1513-21). Like his father, the new Pope was a generous patron of art\r\nand literature, and bestowed upon his literary friends, some of whom\r\nwere exceedingly unworthy, the highest dignities in the Church.\r\nHumanism was triumphant at the Papal Court, but, unfortunately,\r\nreligion was neglected. Though in his personal life Leo X. could not\r\nbe described as a deeply religious man, yet he was mindful of his vows\r\nof celibacy, attentive to the recitation of the divine, office,\r\nabstemious, and observant of the fasts of the Church. As a secular\r\nruler he would have stood incomparably higher than any of the\r\ncontemporary sovereigns of Europe, but he was out of place\r\nconsiderably as the head of a great religious organisation.\r\nWorldliness and indifference to the dangers that threatened the Church\r\nare the most serious charges that can be made against him, but\r\nespecially in the circumstances of the time, when the Holy See should\r\nhave set itself to combat the vicious tendencies of society, these\r\nfaults were serious enough.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of the French forces at Novara (1513), and the loyalty of\r\nthe other rulers of Europe to the Holy See induced Louis XII. of\r\nFrance to make peace with the new Pope, and to recognise the Lateran\r\nCouncil. But on the accession of Francis I. (1515-47) a fresh\r\nexpedition into Italy was undertaken; the Swiss troops were overthrown\r\nat Marignano (1515) and Leo X. was obliged to conclude a Concordat[3]\r\nwith the French King. By the terms of this agreement France agreed to\r\nabandon the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges, while the Pope bestowed\r\nupon Francis I. and his successors the right of presentation to the\r\nbishoprics and abbacies in his dominions. The work of reform, which\r\nshould have claimed special attention at the Lateran Council, was\r\nnever undertaken seriously. Some decrees were passed prohibiting\r\nplurality of benefices, forbidding officials of the Curia to demand\r\nmore than the regulation fees, recommending preaching and religious\r\ninstruction of children, regulating the appointment to benefices,\r\netc., but these decrees, apart from the fact that they left the root\r\nof the evils untouched, were never enforced. The close of the Lateran\r\nCouncil synchronises with the opening of Luther's campaign in Germany,\r\nfor the success of which the Council's failure to respond to the\r\nrepeated demands for reform is to a great extent responsible.\r\n\r\nIn any scheme for the reform of the abuses that afflicted the Church\r\nthe reformation of the Papal Court itself should have occupied the\r\nforemost place. At all times a large proportion of the cardinals and\r\nhigher officials were men of blameless lives, but, unfortunately, many\r\nothers were utterly unworthy of their position, and their conduct was\r\nhighly prejudicial to religion and to the position of the Holy See.\r\nMuch of the scandalous gossip retailed by Platina in his /Lives of the\r\nPopes/, and by Burcard[4] and Infessura[5] in their /Diaries/ may be\r\nattributed to personal disappointment and diseased imaginations, but\r\neven when due allowance has been made for the frailty of human\r\ntestimony, enough remains to prove that the Papal Court in the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries was not calculated to inspire\r\nstrangers to Rome with confidence or respect. Such corrupt and greedy\r\nofficials reflected discredit on the Holy See, and afforded some\r\njustification for the charges levelled against them of using religion\r\nmerely as a means of raising money.\r\n\r\nThe various taxations,[6] direct and indirect, levied by the Popes\r\nduring the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries helped to give colour to\r\nthese accusations. It ought to be remembered, however, that the Popes\r\ncould not carry on the government of the Church, and support the large\r\nbody of officials whose services were absolutely necessary, without\r\nrequiring help from their subjects in all parts of the world. During\r\nthe residence of the Popes at Avignon additional expenses were\r\nincurred owing to the necessity of providing residences for themselves\r\nand their court, and, at the same time, the rebellions and disorders\r\nin the Papal States put an end to any hope of deriving any revenue\r\nfrom their own temporal dominions. On their return to Rome money was\r\nrequired to repair the palaces that had gone into ruin, and to enable\r\nthe Popes to maintain their position as patrons of art and literature,\r\nand as the leaders of Europe in its struggle against the forces of\r\nIslam.\r\n\r\nFor this last purpose, namely, to organise the Christian forces\r\nagainst the Turks, the Popes claimed the right of levying a fixed tax\r\non all ecclesiastical property. The amount of this varied from one-\r\nthirtieth to one-tenth of the annual revenue, and as a rule it was\r\nraised only for some definite period of years. Even in the days when\r\nthe crusading fever was universal, such a tax excited a great deal of\r\nopposition; but when Europe had grown weary of the struggle, and when\r\nthe Popes could do little owing to the failure of the temporal rulers\r\nto respond to their appeals, this form of taxation was resented\r\nbitterly, and the right of the Popes to raise taxes in this way off\r\necclesiastical property was questioned by the ecclesiastics affected\r\nas well as by the temporal rulers. England and France took measures to\r\nprotect themselves; but in Germany the absence of any strong central\r\nauthority, and the want of unity among the princes made it difficult\r\nto offer any effective resistance to these demands. In 1354, 1372,\r\n1459, 1487, and in 1500, the German bishops protested strongly against\r\nthe attempts of the Pope to levy taxes on ecclesiastical property.\r\n\r\nBut in addition to these extraordinary levies there were many\r\npermanent sources of revenue for the support of the Papal Court. In\r\nthe first place from the time of Boniface IX. annats, which consisted\r\nof a certain proportion of the first year's revenue, were to be paid\r\nby all clerics on whom a minor benefice was conferred by the Holy See.\r\nIn case of the major benefices, bishoprics and abbacies, the /servitia\r\ncommunia/ and the /servitia minuta/ took the place of annats. The\r\n/servitia communia/ was a fixed sum the amount of which depended upon\r\nthe annual revenue of the See or abbey, and was divided between the\r\nPope and the cardinals of the Curia. The /servitia minuta/, amounting\r\nto about 3 1/2 per cent. of the /servitia communia/, was given to the\r\nlower officials, who prepared the letters of appointment. The revenues\r\nof vacant Sees and the property of deceased bishops were also claimed\r\nby the Holy See. From England the Pope received yearly the Peter's\r\nPence, and from all countries that acknowledged his feudal\r\njurisdiction he was entitled to a definite annual tribute.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the reservations[7] of benefices were another fruitful\r\nsource of revenue. The policy of reserving benefices to the Holy See\r\nmight be defended, on the ground that it was often necessary in order\r\nto counterbalance the interference of secular rulers in regard to\r\necclesiastical appointments, and that it afforded the Pope a\r\nconvenient means of rewarding officials whose services were required\r\nfor the government of the Church. But the right of the Pope to reserve\r\nbenefices was abused during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries,\r\nand gave rise to constant friction with the civil and ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities in different countries of Europe. Reservations, instead of\r\nbeing the exception, became very general, and, as a result, the eyes\r\nof all ambitious clerics were turned towards Rome from which they\r\nhoped to receive promotion, whether their immediate superiors deemed\r\nthem worthy or unworthy. Such a state of affairs opened the way to the\r\nmost serious abuses, and not unfrequently to disedifying wrangles\r\nbetween rival candidates, all of whom claimed to have received their\r\nappointments from Roman officials.\r\n\r\nIntimately connected with papal reservations were expectancies or\r\npromises given to certain persons that they would be appointed to\r\ncertain benefices as soon as a vacancy would occur. Such promises of\r\nappointment were unknown in the Church before the twelfth century, but\r\nlater on they became very general, and led to most serious abuses\r\nduring the residence of the Popes at Avignon and during the\r\ndisturbances caused by the Great Western Schism. Expectancies were\r\nadopted as a means of raising money or of securing support. Various\r\nattempts were made to put an end to such a disastrous practice, as for\r\nexample at the Councils of Constance and Basle, but it was reserved\r\nfor the Council of Trent to effect this much needed reform.\r\n\r\nAgain the custom of handing over benefices /in commendam/, that is of\r\ngiving some person the right of drawing the revenues of a vacant\r\nbenefice for a certain specified time, was highly prejudicial to the\r\nbest interests of religion. Such a practice, however justifiable in\r\ncase of benefices to which the care of souls was not attached, was\r\nentirely indefensible when adopted in regard to bishopric, abbacies,\r\nand minor benefices, where so much depended upon personal activity and\r\nexample. The person who held the benefice /in commendam/ did nothing\r\nexcept to draw the revenue attached to his office, while the whole\r\nwork was committed to an underpaid vicar or representative, who was\r\nobliged often to resort to all kinds of devices to secure sufficient\r\nmeans of support. Again though plurality of benefices was prohibited\r\nby several decrees, yet during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries\r\nnothing was more common than to find one individual holding, by virtue\r\nof a papal dispensation, two, three, six, ten, and possibly more\r\nbenefices to most of which the care of souls was attached. Such a\r\nstate of affairs was regarded as an intolerable scandal by right\r\nminded Christians, whether lay or cleric, and was condemned by decrees\r\nof Popes and councils; but as exceptions were made in favour of\r\ncardinals or princes, and as even outside these cases dispensations\r\nwere given frequently, the evils of plurality continued unabated.\r\n\r\nAgain, the frequent applications for and concessions of dispensations\r\nin canonical irregularities by the Roman congregations were likely to\r\nmake a bad impression, and to arouse the suspicion that wholesome\r\nregulations were being abandoned for the sake of the dispensation fees\r\npaid to the officials. Similarly, too, complaints were made about the\r\ndispensations given in the marriage impediments, and the abuses\r\nalleged against preachers to whose charge the duty of preaching\r\nindulgences was committed. Furthermore, the custom of accepting\r\nappeals in the Roman Courts, even when the matters in dispute were of\r\nthe most trivial kind, was prejudicial to the local authorities, while\r\nthe undue prolongation of such suits left the Roman lawyers exposed to\r\nthe charge of making fees rather than justice the motive of their\r\nexertions.\r\n\r\nThe disturbances produced by the schism, and the interference of the\r\nstate in episcopal elections helped to secure the appointment of many\r\nunworthy bishops. Even in the worst days of the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries a large proportion of the bishops in the different\r\ncountries of Europe were excellent men, but a large percentage also,\r\nespecially in Germany, were thoroughly worldly. They were more anxious\r\nabout their position as secular princes or proprietors than about the\r\nfulfilment of their sacred duties. Very often they were sprung from\r\nthe nobility, and were appointed on account of their family influence\r\nwithout any regard to their qualifications, and, as a rule, the duties\r\nof visitation, of holding synods, and even of residing in their\r\ndioceses, were neglected. Besides, even when they were anxious to do\r\ntheir best, the claims of the lay patrons and the papal reservation of\r\nbenefices made it difficult for them to exercise proper disciplinary\r\ncontrol over their clergy. In many cases, too, the cathedral chapters\r\nwere utterly demoralised, mainly owing to outside influence in the\r\nappointment of the canons. The clergy as a body were very far from\r\nbeing as bad as they have been painted by fanatical reformers or by\r\nthe followers of Luther. The collections of sermons that have come\r\ndown to us, the prayer books for the instruction of the faithful, the\r\ncatechisms, the compilations from the Holy Scriptures, the hymns,\r\ntheological works, and especially the compendiums prepared for the use\r\nof those engaged in hearing confessions, give the lie to the charge of\r\nwholesale neglect[8]; but, at the same time the want of sufficient\r\ncontrol, the interference of lay patrons in the appointments to\r\nbenefices, the absence of seminaries, and the failure of the\r\nuniversities to give a proper ecclesiastical training, produced their\r\nnatural effect on a large body of the clergy. Grave charges of\r\nignorance, indifference, concubinage, and simony were not wholly\r\ngroundless, as the decrees of various councils sufficiently testify.\r\n\r\nMany causes contributed to bring about a relaxation of discipline in\r\nmany of the religious orders. The uncanonical appointment of abbots,\r\nthe union of various abbacies in the hands of a single individual, the\r\ncustom of holding abbacies /in commendam/, and the wholesale exemption\r\nfrom episcopal authority for which many of the religious orders\r\ncontended, are sufficient to account for this general relaxation. The\r\nstate of the various houses and provinces even belonging to the same\r\norder depended largely on the character of the superiors, and hence it\r\nis not fair to judge one country or one province, or even one house,\r\nby what happened in other countries, provinces, or houses. Hence\r\narises the difficulty of arriving at any general conclusion about the\r\nreligious houses. It is safe, however, to say that with the exception\r\nof the Carthusians all the older orders required reform. From the\r\nbeginning of the fifteenth century attempts were made to restore the\r\nold discipline in the Benedictine communities and with considerable\r\nsuccess. The Carmelites were divided into two main branches, the\r\nCalced and the Discalced; the Franciscans were divided into three main\r\nbodies, the Conventuals, the Observants, and the Capuchins; the\r\nDominicans made various efforts to restore the ancient discipline\r\nespecially from about the beginning of the fifteenth century; while\r\nmany of the Augustinians who were determined on reform established new\r\ncongregations, as for example, the Discalced Augustinian Hermits, who\r\nspread themselves over France, Spain, and Portugal. In addition,\r\nvarious new congregations, amongst them the Oblates founded in 1433 by\r\nSt. Francisca Romana, and the Hermit Brothers in 1435 by St. Francis\r\nof Paula, were established to meet the necessities of the age.[9]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the endless disputes between the religious and secular\r\nclergy[10] at this period tended to distract the attention of both\r\nfrom their spiritual work, and to give rise to considerable disorder\r\nand discontent. On the one side, men like the Paris professor, John\r\nPoilly and Richard Fitzralph, Archbishop of Armagh, were too extreme\r\nand seemed inclined to leave to the religious orders no place in the\r\nministration of the Church, while on the other, some of the religious,\r\nsuch as the Franciscan, John von Gorrel, wished to assert for\r\nthemselves complete independence of episcopal control. Various\r\nattempts were made by Boniface VIII., Benedict XI., Alexander V., John\r\nXXII., Calixtus III., Sixtus IV., and by the Councils of Constance and\r\nBasle to settle these disputes, but without much permanent result. It\r\nwas only in the eleventh session of the Fifth Lateran Council (1516)\r\nthat Leo X. promulgated the decrees, which in substance hold good at\r\nthe present time, fixing the relation between the bishops and the\r\nregular clergy.[11]\r\n\r\nMany of the fanatical preachers anxious for reform were guilty of\r\nundoubted exaggeration in the pictures which they painted of clerical\r\nlife at the time, as were also not a few of the Humanists, anxious to\r\ncast ridicule on their opponents. But even when all due allowance has\r\nbeen made for these exaggerations in such works as the /Onus\r\nEcclesiae/[12] of Bishop Berthold, the rhymed sermons of one of the\r\ngreat Franciscan opponents of Luther, Thomas Murner (1475-1537), which\r\nbecame popular in Germany under the titles of the /Narrenbeschworung/\r\nand the /Schelmenzunft/, Faber's /Tractatus de Ruinae Ecclesiae\r\nPlanctu/, the /Encomium Moriae/ of Erasmus, the Dialogues of St.\r\nGerman in England, the /Narrenschiff/ of Sebastian Brant, and the\r\npetitions of the Spanish Cortes, enough remains to convince any\r\nreasonable man that a reform of the clergy was an urgent necessity.\r\n\r\nFor many years the cry of reform of the Church in its head and members\r\nhad been heard in nearly every country of Europe. The justice of such\r\na demand was admitted universally, but the difficulties in the way\r\nwere so great that no Pope cared to risk a generous scheme of reform.\r\nMost of the abuses of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries might be\r\ntraced back to the decline of the papal power during the Avignon exile\r\nand the Great Western Schism. When peace was restored to the Church,\r\nand when the Popes might have done something for the revival of\r\necclesiastical discipline, the advocates of the conciliar theory\r\nblocked the way by their extravagant attacks on the Papacy, and by\r\ntheir attempts to destroy the supremacy of the Holy See under the\r\nguise of reforming the Roman Curia. Besides, it was impossible to\r\ncarry through any effective measures for the removal of abuses without\r\nattacking what were regarded as vested interests, and the holders of\r\nthese interests were determined not to yield without a struggle. The\r\ncardinals wished to restrict the rights of the Pope; the bishops\r\nwished to reform the cardinals and the Papal Court; the Paris doctors\r\nwished to reform the bishops and the regular clergy; while the regular\r\nclergy traced all the evils in the Church to the indifference and\r\nneglect of the secular priests. Unfortunately there was no man endowed\r\nwith the foresight and the courage of Gregory VII. to put his finger\r\nupon the real cause of the downfall, namely the slavery of the Church,\r\nand to lead a campaign for the independence of the spiritual power,\r\nparticularly for the restoration of free canonical elections.\r\n\r\nAt the Council of Constance everybody recognised the necessity of\r\nreform, but the jealousies of the various nations, the opposition of\r\nthe interests concerned, and the fear of provoking a new schism, made\r\nit impossible to do more than to adopt temporary expedients, which, it\r\nwas hoped, might give some relief. Decrees concerning exemption from\r\nepiscopal authority, the union of benefices, simony, tithes, and the\r\nduties of the clerical state were promulgated in the fourteenth\r\nsession, and the other questions, upon which the different nations\r\ncould not agree, were to be regulated by Concordats with the Holy See.\r\nThe Concordat with the German nation dealt with canonical election,\r\nappeals to Rome, annats, indulgences, dispensations, and the\r\nlimitation of excommunication; the English Concordat insisted on the\r\nright of England to be represented in the college of cardinals and\r\ncontained clauses dealing with indulgences and dispensations; the\r\nConcordant with Castile regarded the number of cardinals, the\r\nreservation and collation of benefices, annats, /commendams/, appeals,\r\nand indulgences; by the Concordat with France it was arranged that\r\nowing to the wars in which France was engaged the annats and other\r\ntaxes payable to the Holy See should be reduced considerably. Measures\r\nsuch as these were utterly inadequate even had they been observed to\r\nthe letter, but in reality complaints were made frequently, especially\r\nin Germany, that they were disregarded.\r\n\r\nThe Council which met in Siena (1524) was entirely unrepresentative,\r\nand was dissolved without having accomplished anything. But great\r\nhopes were expressed that the Council of Basle would formulate and\r\ncarry out a thorough scheme of reform. Unfortunately, however, these\r\nhopes were doomed to disappointment. An extreme section, hostile to\r\nthe Papacy and determined to weaken its position, dominated the\r\nCouncil, and made it impossible to do the work for which the assembly\r\nhad been convoked. Though the council held its first session in 1431,\r\nnearly four years passed before any reform decrees were issued. They\r\ndealt with concubinage, excommunication, the abuse of interdicts, and\r\nthe abolition of annats and other taxes payable to the Holy See. The\r\nviolence with which the Council assailed Eugene IV., and the fear of a\r\nnew schism alienated many who were anxious for reform, but who were\r\nnot willing to attack the essential prerogatives of the Pope. The\r\nclergy of France met at Bourges in 1432, and with their consent the\r\nPragmatic Sanction of Bourges was published by the king in 1438.\r\nAccording to this edict annats were retained, but were reduced to one-\r\nfifth of the amount formerly paid, and most of the reformatory decrees\r\nof Basle were adopted for use in France. Germany was desirous of\r\nreform, but at the same time unwilling to break with the Holy See, and\r\nhence the German nation remained neutral in the disputes between\r\nEugene IV. and the Council. Finally Germany returned to its\r\nallegiance, and the Concordat of Vienna was signed in 1448, according\r\nto which the right of the Pope to make appointments to benefices in\r\nthe Empire and the amount of the fees to be paid to the Curia were\r\nregulated. This agreement was not regarded with favour in some parts\r\nof Germany, and complaints were made frequently by the princes that\r\nthe terms of the agreement were not observed by the Roman officials.\r\nEngland also took steps to protect itself by the Statutes of\r\n/Provisors/ and /Praemunire/ (1453). These statutes rendered null and\r\nvoid all collations, reservations or provisions of benefices made by\r\nthe Holy See in England, and forbade all appeals to the Roman tribunal\r\non questions which could be settled before English tribunals.\r\n\r\nDuring the pontificate of Nicholas V., Calixtus III., and Pius II.,\r\nvery little was done for reform. The fear that if another General\r\nCouncil were convoked the disgraceful scenes of Basle might be\r\nrepeated, and the dangers which threatened Europe from a Turkish\r\ninvasion, seem to have paralysed the Popes, and to have prevented them\r\nfrom taking effective measures to abolish evident abuses. Paul II.\r\ndid, indeed, take action against the Pagan Humanists who barely\r\nconcealed their antipathy to Christianity even in the city of the\r\nPopes, but he took no steps to remove the influences which had made\r\nsuch a state of affairs possible. As a rule at each successive\r\nconclave the cardinal electors pledged themselves that whichever of\r\nthem should be elected would undertake certain measures, some of which\r\nmight have redounded to the good of the universal Church, others of\r\nthem merely to the advantage of the sacred college itself; but these\r\nelection agreements were always quashed, and the evil was allowed to\r\nincrease without check. From the election of Sixtus IV. the tendency\r\nwas steadily downwards, till in the days of Alexander VI. the Papacy\r\nreached its lowest point. At a time when even people indifferent to\r\nreligion were shocked by the state of affairs at the Roman Court, it\r\nis no wonder that a zealous and holy ecclesiastic like the great\r\nDominican Savonarola[13] should have denounced these abuses in no\r\nuncertain language, and should have warned Alexander VI. of the\r\nterrible judgment in store for the Church unless some steps were taken\r\nto avert the indignation of an offended Almighty. The threats and\r\nwarnings of Savonarola were, however, scoffed at as the unbridled\r\noutbursts of a disappointed fanatic, and the cry for reform was put\r\naside as unworthy of attention.\r\n\r\nJulius II. (1503-13) was personally above reproach, but the\r\ncircumstances of his time allowed him very little opportunity to\r\nundertake a generous plan of reform. The recovery of the Papal States\r\nthat had been frittered away by his predecessors in providing\r\nterritories for their family connections, the wars in Italy, and the\r\nschemes of Louis XII. forced the Pope to play the part of a soldier\r\nrather than that of an ecclesiastic, and delayed the convocation of\r\nthe General Council to which right-minded Christians looked for some\r\nrelief. Louis XII., taking advantage of this general desire,\r\nforestalled the Pope by inducing some of the cardinals to summon a\r\nGeneral Council to meet at Pisa (September 1511). The assembly met at\r\nPisa and adjourned to Lyons, but the feeling of loyalty to the Pope\r\nwas too strong for Louis XII., and the assembly at Lyons could count\r\non very little support outside France. Julius II. determined to summon\r\na General Council to meet in Rome for the reformation of the Church.\r\nThis, the Fifth Lateran Council, as it was called, was opened in May\r\n1512, but the earlier sessions were devoted almost entirely to the\r\ncondemnation of the French schism, the decrees of the /Conciliabulum/\r\nat Lyons, and the Pragmatic Sanction. Before the work of reform could\r\nbe taken in hand Julius XII. died (1513), and the young cardinal\r\ndeacon, John de' Medici, ascended the papal throne under the title of\r\nLeo X.\r\n\r\nFrom the new Pope, if one were to judge him by his antecedents, a\r\ndevelopment of classical learning and art might be expected rather\r\nthan a renewal of religion. Personally Leo X. was not a wicked man. On\r\nthe contrary in his private life he was attentive to his religious\r\nduties, but he was indifferent and inclined to let things shape their\r\nown course. The Lateran Council did, indeed, undertake the restoration\r\nof ecclesiastical discipline. It condemned abuses in connexion with\r\nthe bestowal of benefices, decreed the reformation of the Curia,\r\nespecially in regard to taxes, defined the position of the regulars in\r\nregard to the bishops of the dioceses in which their houses were\r\nsituated, ordered the bishops to enforce their censorship over books\r\npublished within their jurisdiction, and approved of the Concordat\r\nthat had been arranged between Leo and Francis I. (1516).\r\n\r\nSuch reforms as these were so completely inadequate that they failed\r\nto give satisfaction to the host of clerics and laymen who desired a\r\nthorough reform. The news that the Council was dissolved in March 1517\r\nwithout having grappled with the urgent reform of the Church in its\r\nhead and members, sent a thrill of dismay throughout the Christian\r\nworld, and secured for Luther the sympathy of many when a few months\r\nlater he opened his campaign at Wittenberg. It was thought at first\r\nthat he aimed merely at the removal of abuses, and in this work he\r\ncould have counted upon the active co-operation of some of the leading\r\nGerman ecclesiastics, who showed themselves his strongest opponents\r\nonce they realised that he aimed not so much at reform as at the\r\ndestruction of the Church and of all religious authority.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] Weiss, /Aeneas Silvius als Papst Pius II./, 1897.

Its leader was Martin Luther,\r\nthe son of a miner, born at Eisleben in 1483. As a boy he attended\r\nschool at Eisenach and Magdeburg, supporting himself by singing in the\r\nstreets until a kind benefactress came to his assistance in the person\r\nof Ursula Cotta. His father, having improved his position in the\r\nworld, determined to send the youth to study law at the University of\r\nErfurt, which was then one of the leading centres of Humanism on the\r\nnorthern side of the Alps. But though Luther was in close touch with\r\nsome of the principal classical scholars of Germany and was by no\r\nmeans an indifferent classical scholar himself, there is no evidence\r\nof his having been influenced largely in his religious views by the\r\nHumanist movement. He turned his attention principally to the study of\r\nphilosophy, and having received his degree in 1505, he began to\r\nlecture on the physics and ethics of Aristotle.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, to the surprise of his friends, and the no small vexation of\r\nhis father the young Luther, who had not been particularly remarkable\r\nfor his religious fervour, abandoned his career at the university and\r\nentered the novitiate of the Augustinian monastery at Erfurt (July\r\n1505). The motives which induced him to take this unexpected step are\r\nnot clear. Some say he was led to do so by the sudden death of a\r\nstudent friend, others that it was in fulfilment of a vow which he had\r\nmade during a frightful thunderstorm that overtook him on a journey\r\nfrom his father's house to Erfurt, while he himself tells us that he\r\nbecame a monk because he had lost confidence in himself.[1] Of his\r\nlife as a student very little is known for certain. Probably he was no\r\nworse and no better than his companions in a university city, which\r\nwas described by himself in later life as a \"beerhouse\" and a \"nest of\r\nimmorality.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThe sudden change from the freedom and excitement of the university to\r\nthe silence and monotony of the cloister had a depressing influence on\r\na man like Luther, who, being of a nervous, highly-strung temperament,\r\nwas inclined to pass quickly from one extreme to another. He began to\r\nbe gloomy and scrupulous, and was driven at times almost to despair of\r\nhis salvation; but Staupitz, the superior of the province, endeavoured\r\nto console him by impressing on him the necessity of putting his trust\r\nentirely in the merits of Christ. Yet in spite of his scruples\r\nLuther's life as a novice was a happy one. He was assiduous in the\r\nperformance of his duties, attentive to the instruction of his\r\nsuperiors, and especially anxious to acquire a close acquaintance with\r\nthe Sacred Scriptures, the reading and study of which were strongly\r\nrecommended to all novices in the Augustinian order at this period.[3]\r\nIn 1506 he was allowed to make his vows, and in the following year he\r\nwas ordained priest. During the celebration of his first Mass he was\r\nso overcome by a sense of his own unworthiness to offer up such a pure\r\nsacrifice that he would have fled from the altar before beginning the\r\ncanon had it not been for his assistants, and throughout the ceremony\r\nhe was troubled lest he should commit a mortal sin by the slightest\r\nneglect of the rubrics. At the breakfast that followed, to which\r\nLuther's relatives had been invited, father and son met for the first\r\ntime since Luther entered the monastery. While the young priest waxed\r\neloquent about the happiness of his vocation and about the storm from\r\nheaven that helped him to understand himself, his father, who had kept\r\nsilent throughout the repast, unable to restrain himself any longer\r\ninterrupted suddenly with the remark that possibly he was deceived,\r\nand that what he took to be from God might have been the work of the\r\ndevil. \"I sit here,\" he continued, \"eating and drinking but I would\r\nmuch prefer to be far from this spot.\" Luther tried to pacify him by\r\nreminding him of the godly character of monasticism, but the\r\ninterruption was never forgotten by Luther himself or by his friends\r\nwho heard it.\r\n\r\nAfter his ordination the young monk turned his attention to theology,\r\nbut, unfortunately, the theological training given to the Augustinian\r\nnovices at this period was of the poorest and most meagre kind.[4] He\r\nstudied little if anything of the works of the early Fathers, and\r\nnever learned to appreciate Scholasticism as expounded by its greatest\r\nmasters, St. Thomas or St. Bonaventure. His knowledge of Scholastic\r\nTheology was derived mainly from the works of the rebel friar William\r\nof Occam, who, in his own time, was at constant war with the Popes,\r\nand who, during the greater part of his life, if not at the moment of\r\nhis death, was under sentence of excommunication from the Church. The\r\nwritings of such a man, betraying as they did an almost complete\r\nunacquaintance with the Scriptures and exaggerating men's natural\r\npowers to the undervaluing or partial exclusion of Grace, exercised a\r\nbaneful influence on a man of Luther's tastes and temperaments.\r\nAccepted by Luther as characteristic of Scholastic Theology, such\r\nwritings prejudiced him against the entire system. Acting on the\r\nadvice of the provincial, Staupitz, he gave himself up with great zeal\r\nto the study of the Bible, and later on he turned his attention to the\r\nworks of St. Augustine, particularly the works written in defence of\r\nthe Catholic doctrine on Grace against the Pelagians. In 1508 he went\r\nto the university of Wittenberg, founded recently by Frederick of\r\nSaxony, to lecture on Logic and Ethics, and to continue his\r\ntheological studies; but for some reason, as yet unexplained, he was\r\nrecalled suddenly to his monastery at Erfurt, where he acquired fame\r\nrapidly as a lecturer and preacher.\r\n\r\nThirty foundations of the Augustinians in Saxony had accepted the\r\nreform begun by Andrew Proles in the fifteenth century, and had\r\nseparated themselves definitely from the unreformed houses of the\r\norder in Germany. They were subject immediately to the general of the\r\norder, whose vicar at this time in Saxony was the well-known Humanist,\r\nStaupitz.[5] The latter was anxious to bring about a reunion between\r\nthe two parties and to have himself appointed as superior; but the\r\nparty who stood for the strict observance were opposed bitterly to\r\nsuch a step, and determined to send a representative to Rome to plead\r\ntheir cause. The fact that they selected so young a man as Luther to\r\nchampion their interests is a sufficient proof of the position which\r\nhe had won for himself amongst his religious brethren. He was looked\r\nup to already as an ornament of the order, and his selection for this\r\nhighly important mission served to increase the over-weening pride and\r\nself-confidence that had manifested themselves already as weak spots\r\nin his character. Accompanied by a companion of his order he started\r\non his long journey across the Alps. As he reached the heights of\r\nMonte Mario and surveyed the Popes he fell on his knees, according to\r\nthe custom of the pilgrims, and hailed \"the city thrice sanctified by\r\nthe blood of martyrs.\" He had looked forward with pleasure to a stay\r\nin Rome, where he might have an opportunity of setting his scruples to\r\nrest by a general confession of his sins, but, unfortunately, his\r\nbrother Augustinians in Rome and those with whom he came most in\r\ncontact seemed to have been more anxious to regale him with stories\r\nabout the real or imaginary scandals of the city than to give him\r\nspiritual consolation or advice. Yet in later life, when he had\r\ndefinitely separated from the Church and when he was most anxious to\r\nblacken the character of Rome and the Popes, it is remarkable that he\r\ncould point to very little detrimental to them of which he had\r\npersonal knowledge, and was forced to rely solely on what had been\r\ntold him by others. Nor did he leave Rome as a declared enemy of the\r\nPapacy, for even so late as 1516 he defended warmly the supremacy of\r\nthe Pope as the one safeguard for the unity of the Church.[6] Many of\r\nhis biographers, indeed, assert that, as he stood by the /Scala\r\nSancta/ and witnessed the pilgrims ascending on their bare knees, he\r\nturned aside disgusted with the sight and repeated the words of St.\r\nPaul, \"the just man lives by his faith\"; but such a statement, due\r\nentirely to the imagination of his relatives and admirers is rejected\r\nas a legend by those best qualified to judge.[7] The threatened union\r\nof the strict and unreformed that had occasioned Luther's journey to\r\nRome was abandoned; but it is worthy of note that Staupitz had\r\nsucceeded in detaching him from his former friends, and that he\r\nreturned to Germany a convinced and violent opponent of the party of\r\nstrict observance, who had sent him to Rome as their representative.\r\nDuring his stay in the city there is good reason for believing that on\r\nhis own behalf he sought for permission to lay aside his monastic\r\nhabit and to devote himself for ten years to study in Italy, but his\r\nrequest was refused on the ground that it was not supported by the\r\nauthority of his superiors. This petition was probably the foundation\r\nfor the rumours that were circulated in Germany by his opponents that\r\nwhile in Rome he endeavoured to have himself \"secularised\" and to\r\nobtain a dispensation to marry.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Germany he devoted himself once more to the study of\r\ntheology in preparation for the doctorate which he won at Wittenberg\r\nin 1512. Almost immediately he was appointed professor at the\r\nuniversity and undertook to lecture on the Psalms. His eloquence and\r\nhis imagination, his retentive memory enabling him to illustrate his\r\ntexts by parallel passages drawn from the books of the Old Testament,\r\nand in a certain way his exaggerations, his strength of diction, and\r\nhis asperity of language towards all with whose views he did not find\r\nhimself in agreement, made his lectures most popular at the\r\nuniversity, and filled his hall with an eager and attentive audience.\r\nAmongst the students Luther had no rival, and even the few professors\r\nwho were inclined to resent his methods and his views were captivated\r\nby the magic influence of their brilliant young colleague. The\r\nAugustinians, mindful of the honour he was achieving for their order,\r\nhastened to appoint him to the important position of district vicar\r\n(1515), while the Elector Frederick could not conceal his delight at\r\nhaving secured the services of so capable a professor for the new\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\nAt Wittenberg Luther felt himself completely at home. He was proud of\r\nthe distinctions conferred upon him by his brethren, and of the\r\ninfluence accorded to him by his companions in the university. Great\r\nas were his industry and his powers of application, yet they were put\r\nto the most severe tests to enable him to complete the programme he\r\nhad set himself to accomplish. His lectures at the university, his\r\nsermons preached in the Augustinian church, his visitations of the\r\nhouses of his order in the district over which he was vicar, his\r\ncorrespondence, partly routine and partly entailed by his close\r\nrelations with some of the leading men in Germany, occupied all his\r\ntime even to the exclusion of the spiritual exercises enjoined by his\r\nrule. Very frequently he neglected to celebrate Mass or even to read\r\nthe divine office, and then alarmed by his negligence and guilt he had\r\nrecourse to extraordinary forms of penance. Fits of laxity were\r\nfollowed by fits of scrupulousness until at last he was driven at\r\ntimes almost to despair. It was then that he called to mind the\r\nconsoling advice given to him by his superior that he should put his\r\ntrust in the merits of Christ, and the teaching of St. Augustine on\r\nthe frailty of human nature unless it was aided and supported by\r\ndivine Grace. He began to develop the idea that justification could\r\nnot be acquired by good works, that concupiscence could not be\r\novercome, and that consequently man could be justified only by the\r\nimputation of the merits of Christ. Years before, views such as these\r\nhad been passing through his mind, as may be seen in his sermons\r\nagainst the Augustinians of the strict observance, but they found\r\nadequate expression only in his commentaries on the Epistles of St.\r\nPaul to the Romans and to the Galatians (1515-6). Still, as yet, he\r\nheld strongly to the principle of authority in matters of religion,\r\nand inveighed against heretics who would dare to set aside the\r\nauthority of the Pope in order to follow their own judgment. In\r\nreality, however, his own teaching on merit and justification was no\r\nlonger in harmony with Catholic doctrine, and only a slight occasion\r\nwas required to bring him into open and definite conflict with the\r\nauthorities of the Church.\r\n\r\nThis occasion was provided by the preaching in Germany of an\r\nIndulgence proclaimed by Leo X. (1513-21). The building of St. Peter's\r\nhad been begun by Julius II. and was continued by his successor Leo\r\nX., the son of Lorenzo de' Medici, and the great patron of the\r\nHumanist movement. In order to provide funds to enable him to continue\r\nthis gigantic undertaking Leo X. proclaimed an Indulgence. In addition\r\nto Confession and Holy Communion it was ordered that those of the\r\nfaithful who wished to share in the spiritual favours granted by the\r\nPope should contribute according to their means for the completion of\r\nSt. Peter's, or that they should pray for the success of the work in\r\ncase poverty did not permit them to give alms. The publication of the\r\nIndulgence in a great part of Germany was entrusted to Albrecht of\r\nBrandenberg, who had been elected Archbishop of Mainz though he was\r\nalready Archbishop of Magdeburg and Administrator of Halberstadt. The\r\nfees to be paid by an archbishop appointed to Mainz were exceptionally\r\nhigh not to speak of the large sum required for the extraordinary\r\nfavour of being allowed to hold two archbishoprics. As a means of\r\nenabling Albrecht to raise the required amount, it was proposed by an\r\nofficial of the Datary that he should be allowed to retain half of the\r\ncontributions given on the occasion of the publication of the\r\nIndulgence in the provinces of Mainz and Magdeburg, and in the lands\r\nof the House of Brandenburg.\r\n\r\nTo publish the Indulgence in the above-mentioned territories Albrecht\r\nappointed the Dominican John Tetzel,[8] who had acquired already\r\nconsiderable renown as a preacher. Tetzel was a man of solid education\r\nand of good moral standing, whose reputation as a successful popular\r\npreacher stood high in Germany at this period. Many grave abuses have\r\nbeen alleged against him by his enemies concerning his manner of\r\ncarrying out the office entrusted to him by the archbishop, and in\r\nregard to his own private life serious crimes have been laid to his\r\ncharge; but as a matter of history it is now admitted that Tetzel was\r\na much maligned man, that his own conduct can bear the fullest\r\nscrutiny, and that in his preaching the worst that can be said against\r\nhim is that he put forward as certainties, especially in regard to\r\ngaining indulgences for the souls of the faithful departed, what were\r\nmerely the opinions of certain schools of theologians. Nor is it true\r\nto say that as the result of his activity vast sums of money made\r\ntheir way into the papal treasury. The accounts of the monies received\r\nduring the greater portion of the time are now available, and it can\r\nbe seen that when all expenses were paid comparatively little remained\r\nfor either the Archbishop of Mainz or the building fund of St.\r\nPeter's.[9]\r\n\r\nTetzel preached with considerable success in Halberstadt, Magdeburg\r\nand Leipzig, and in May 1517 he found himself in the neighbourhood of\r\nWittenberg, whence many people flocked to see him, and to gain the\r\nIndulgence. This was not calculated to please Luther or his patron the\r\nElector, Frederick of Saxony, and provided Luther with an occasion of\r\ngiving vent to his own views on good works, Grace, and Justification.\r\nYears before, both in his sermons attacking the Augustinians of the\r\nstrict observance for their over confidence in the merits of good\r\nworks and penance, and in his commentaries on the Epistles of St. Paul\r\nto the Romans and to the Galatians, he had indicated already that his\r\nviews on man's power to do anything good, and on the means and nature\r\nof justification differed widely from those put forward by Catholic\r\ntheologians. At last, after careful consideration, following the bent\r\nof his own inclination and the advice of his friends, he determined to\r\ntake the field openly by publishing, on the eve of the festival of All\r\nSaints, 1517, his celebrated seventy theses against Indulgences.[10]\r\nThis document was drawn up with great skill and foresight. Some of the\r\ntheses were perfectly orthodox and professed great reverence for the\r\nteaching of the Church and the authority of the Pope; others of them\r\nwere open to an orthodox as well as to an unorthodox interpretation;\r\nothers, still, were opposed clearly and definitely to Catholic\r\ndoctrine, and all of them were put forward in a way that was likely to\r\narrest public attention and to win the support of the masses.[11] They\r\nwere affixed to the doors of the university church in Wittenberg, and\r\ncopies of them were spread broadcast through Germany. Before a week\r\nhad elapsed they were discussed with eagerness in all parts of the\r\ncountry, and the state of feeling became so intense that Tetzel was\r\nobliged to discontinue his mission, and to retire to Frankfurt, where\r\nunder the direction of Wimpina, he set himself to draw up a number of\r\ncounter theses which he offered to defend.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the time were very favourable to a campaign such\r\nas Luther had initiated. The princes of Germany and even some of the\r\nbishops made no secret of their opinion that indulgences had been\r\nabused, and many of them were anything but displeased at the step that\r\nhad been taken by the Wittenberg professor. The old opposition between\r\nthe Teuton and the Latin was growing daily more marked owing to the\r\nviolent and abusive language of men like Ulrich von Hutten, who posed\r\nas German patriots; while the Humanist party, roused by the attacks\r\nmade upon Reuchlin by the Dominicans of Cologne, backed by the\r\nScholastic Theologians, were not sorry to see their opponents\r\nchallenged in their own special department, and obliged to act on the\r\ndefensive. The knights or lower nobles, too, who had been deprived of\r\nmany of their privileges by the princes, were ready for any scheme of\r\nviolence in the hope that it might conduce to their advantage; and the\r\nlower classes ground down for centuries were beginning to realise\r\ntheir own strength, partly owing to the spread of secret societies,\r\nand were willing to lend a ready ear to a leader who had given\r\nexpression to views that were coursing already through their minds.\r\n\r\nFrom all parts of Germany letters of congratulation poured in upon\r\nLuther. Many of these came from men who had no desire for a religious\r\nchange, but who thought that Luther's campaign was directed only\r\nagainst abuses in the Church. From the Humanists, from several of the\r\nprofessors and students of Wittenberg, and even from the superiors of\r\nhis order he received unstinted praise and encouragement. At least one\r\nof the bishops, Lorenz von Bibra of Wurzburg, hastened to intercede\r\nfor him with Frederick the Elector of Saxony, while none of the others\r\ntook up an attitude of unflinching opposition. Tetzel, who had been\r\nforced to abandon his work of preaching, defended publicly at\r\nFrankfurt on the Maine a number of counter theses formulated by Conrad\r\nWimpina. To this attack Luther replied in a sermon on indulgences in\r\nwhich he aimed at expressing in a popular style the kernel of the\r\ndoctrine contained in his theses. Sylvester Prierias, the master of\r\nthe Sacred Palace in Rome, to whom Luther's theses had been forwarded\r\nfor examination, published a sharp attack upon them,[12] and was\r\nanswered in Luther's most abusive style. The most distinguished,\r\nhowever, of the men who took the field against him was John Eck,[13]\r\nProfessor of Theology and Vice-Chancellor of the University of\r\nIngolstadt. He was a man well versed in the Scriptures and in the\r\nwritings of the Fathers, a ready speaker and an incisive writer, in\r\nevery way qualified to meet such a versatile opponent. While on a\r\nvisit with the Bishop of Eichstatt he was consulted about Luther's\r\ntheses, and gave his opinion in the /Obelisks/ on the dangerous\r\ncharacter of the teaching they contained. The /Obelisks/ was prepared\r\nhastily and was not intended for publication, but it was regarded as\r\nso important that copies of it were circulated freely even before it\r\nwas given to the world. Luther replied in the /Asterisks/, a work full\r\nof personal invective and abuse. A Dominican of Cologne, Hochstraten,\r\nalso entered the lists against Luther, but his intervention did more\r\nharm than good to the cause of the Church by alienating the Humanist\r\nparty whom he assailed fiercely as allies and abettors of Luther.\r\nThese attacks, however, served only to give notoriety to Luther's\r\nviews and to win for him the sympathy of his friends. His opponents\r\nmade one great mistake. Their works were intended in great part only\r\nfor the learned, while Luther aimed principally at appealing to the\r\nmasses of the people. The Augustinians represented him as the victim\r\nof a Dominican conspiracy, and to show their high appreciation of his\r\nservices they selected him to conduct the theological disputation at a\r\nchapter meeting held at Leipzig six months after the publication of\r\nhis theses (1518). At this same meeting Luther defended the view that\r\nfree will in man and all power of doing good were destroyed by\r\noriginal sin, and that everything meritorious accomplished by man is\r\nreally done by God. His old opponent at the university, Bodenstein\r\n(surnamed Carlstadt from his place of birth), declared himself openly\r\nin favour of Luther's teaching on free will, and published a reply to\r\nEck.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this controversy between Eck and Carlstadt it was\r\narranged that a public disputation should be held at Leipzig (27 June-\r\n15 July, 1519). The Catholic teaching was to be defended by Eck\r\nagainst his two opponents, Luther and Carlstadt. A hall in the castle\r\nof Pleissenburg was placed at the disposal of the disputants by Duke\r\nGeorge of Saxony, who was a convinced Catholic himself, and who\r\nbelieved that the disputation might be the means of removing many\r\ndoubts and misunderstandings. The acts of the disputation were to be\r\ndrawn up and forwarded to the Universities of Paris and Erfurt for\r\ntheir decision. When it became known throughout Germany that a meeting\r\nhad been arranged between Eck and his two principal opponents, the\r\nexcitement, especially in the learned circles, became intense, and so\r\ngreat was the rush of scholars from all parts of the country to\r\nwitness the encounter, that the immense hall was packed with an eager\r\nand attentive audience when Eck and Carlstadt entered the pulpits that\r\nhad been prepared for them.\r\n\r\nFew men in Germany, or outside it, were more fitted to hold their own\r\nin such a disputation than the distinguished Vice-Chancellor of\r\nIngolstadt. He was a man of imposing appearance, gifted with a clear\r\nand pleasing voice and good memory, even tempered and ready, quick to\r\ndetect the weak points of his adversaries, and keenly alert to their\r\ndamaging concessions and admissions. The first point to be debated\r\nbetween him and Carlstadt was the question of Grace and Free Will.\r\nCarlstadt was at last obliged to concede that the human will was\r\nactive at least to the extent of co-operating or of not co-operating\r\nwith divine Grace, a concession that was opposed entirely to the\r\nthesis he had undertaken to sustain. Luther, alarmed by the\r\ndiscomfiture of his colleague, determined to enter the lists at once\r\non the question of the primacy of the Roman See. He was not, however,\r\nmore successful than Carlstadt. Eck, taking advantage of Luther's\r\nirascible temperament and his exaggerations of speech, forced him step\r\nby step to put aside as worthless interpretations given by the early\r\nFathers to certain passages of Scripture, and to reject the authority\r\nand infallibility of General Councils. Such a line of arguments,\r\nopposed as it was to the teaching and beliefs of the Church, roused\r\nthe opposition of the audience, and served to open the eyes of Duke\r\nGeorge to the real nature of Luther's movement. Annoyed by his own\r\ndefeat and by the attentions and applause lavished upon his rival by\r\nthe people of Leipzig, Luther left the city in disgust. The\r\ndisputation undoubtedly did good in so far as it made clear to all the\r\nposition of the two parties, and succeeded in holding Duke George of\r\nSaxony and the city of Leipzig loyal to the Church; but it also did\r\nmuch harm by giving Luther the notoriety that he was so anxious to\r\nobtain, and by winning to his side Philip Melanchthon, who was\r\ndestined to be in after life his ablest lieutenant. Both sides, as is\r\nusual in such contests, claimed the victory. The Universities of\r\nCologne and Louvain condemned Luther immediately, as did also Paris in\r\n1521, but as far as can be known Erfurt pronounced no decision on the\r\nquestions submitted.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile what was the attitude of the authorities in Rome towards\r\nLuther's movement. Leo X., having learned something of the turmoil\r\ncreated in Germany by Luther's theses and sermons, requested the\r\nvicar-general of the Augustinians to induce his rebellious subject to\r\nrecall his teaching, or, at least, to keep silent. The vicar wrote to\r\nthe principal, Staupitz, but, as the latter was one of those who had\r\nencouraged Luther to take the steps he had taken, very little was done\r\nto secure peace. Luther was, however, induced to write a most\r\nsubmissive letter to the Pope in which he begged for an investigation,\r\npledging himself at the same time to accept the decision of Leo X. as\r\nthe decision of Christ (30th May, 1518).[14] Not satisfied with the\r\ncourse of events, and alarmed by the reports forwarded to him from\r\nGermany, the Pope appointed a commission to examine the whole\r\nquestion, the result of which commission was that Luther was summoned\r\nto submit at once or to appear at Rome to defend himself within sixty\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nHe and his friends were thrown into a state of great alarm by this\r\nunexpected step. On the one hand, were he to submit and to acknowledge\r\nthat he had been in error his reputation would be shattered, the\r\nAugustinians would feel themselves disgraced, and the University of\r\nWittenberg would lose caste in the estimation of educated Germans. On\r\nthe other hand, if he adopted the bold policy of refusing to yield to\r\nthe papal entreaties he was in danger of being denounced publicly as a\r\nheretic. In this difficult situation his friends determined to invoke\r\nthe protection of the Elector Frederick of Saxony, the founder and\r\npatron of Wittenberg University. Alarmed by the danger that threatened\r\nthis institution from the removal or excommunication of one of its\r\nmost popular professors, and anxious to gain time, Frederick requested\r\nthe Pope to refer the matter for decision to some German bishop or to\r\na neutral university. In reply to this request Leo X. appointed\r\nCardinal Cajetan, papal legate in Germany, to hold an inquiry (23\r\nAug., 1518). Luther, having armed himself with a safe conduct, went to\r\nAugsburg to meet the papal representative, who received him very\r\nkindly, and exhorted him to withdraw his statements and submit. Luther\r\nendeavoured to induce the cardinal to enter into a discussion on the\r\nquestions in dispute, but the latter did not allow himself to be drawn\r\ninto a disputation. Finally, Luther refused to submit, though, at the\r\nsame time, he declared solemnly that he wished unsaid and unwritten\r\nwhat he had said or written against the Roman Church. A few days later\r\nhe fled from Augsburg after having drawn up a formal appeal \"from the\r\nPope ill-informed to the Pope well-informed,\" while the cardinal,\r\ndisappointed by the failure of his efforts, turned to the Elector of\r\nSaxony for help against the rebellious monk. But the latter, deceived\r\nby the recommendations forwarded on Luther's behalf by his own\r\nsuperior, Staupitz, yielded to the entreaties of Spalatin, the court\r\nchaplain, and of the professors of Wittenberg, and declined to take\r\nany steps to compel Luther to submit. Fearful, however, lest his\r\npatron might not be able to shield him from the censures of Rome,\r\nLuther determined to anticipate the expected condemnation by issuing\r\nan appeal to a future General Council (28 Nov., 1518).\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Leo X. who had learned from his representative the\r\nresult of the Augsburg interviews, issued the Bull, /Cum postquam/ (9\r\nNov., 1518), in which he explained authoritatively the Catholic\r\ndoctrine on Indulgences, and threatened excommunication against all\r\nwho refused to accept it. This document was deprived of much of its\r\neffect owing to the misrepresentations of Luther and his friends, who\r\nannounced that it owed its origin to the schemes and intrigues of\r\ntheir Dominican opponents at Rome and in Germany. The occasion called\r\nfor speedy and decisive action. But the impending imperial election,\r\nin which Charles I. of Spain (1516-56) and Francis I. of France (1515-\r\n47) were to be rival candidates, made it necessary for the Pope to\r\nproceed cautiously, and above all, to do nothing that might antagonise\r\nthe Elector of Saxony, whose influence would be of the greatest\r\nimportance in deciding the votes of the electoral college, if, indeed,\r\nit did not secure his own election. Had the appointment of a successor\r\nto Maximilian I. rested with Leo X. it can hardly be doubted that, in\r\nthe hope of preserving the balance of power and of securing the\r\nfreedom of the Holy See, he would have favoured the claims of the\r\nElector against either or both the rival monarchs.[15]\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances it was decided to send Karl von Miltitz,[16]\r\nwho was by birth a Saxon nobleman and at that period a chamberlain at\r\nthe Papal Court, to present Frederick with the Golden Rose, and to\r\nbring about a peaceful settlement of a controversy that had been\r\ndisturbing the whole Empire. The selection of Miltitz for such a\r\ndelicate mission was most unfortunate. Proud, obstinate, and ill-\r\ninformed about the real issues at stake, he was anxious to have the\r\nglory of putting an end to the controversy at all costs, and hence he\r\nwas willing to appear before Luther as a humble suitor for peace\r\nrather than as a stern judge. All his severity and reproaches were\r\nreserved for Luther's opponents, especially for Tetzel, whom he held\r\nprimarily responsible for the whole mischief, and towards whom he\r\nacted both imprudently and unjustly. The Elector showed himself but\r\nlittle inclined to respond to the advances of Leo X. He consented,\r\nhowever, to arrange an interview between Miltitz and Luther at\r\nAltenburg (Jan. 1519). During the course of the interviews that took\r\nplace between them, Luther pledged himself to remain silent if his\r\nopponents were forced to do likewise. He promised, too, that if\r\nMiltitz wrote advising the Pope to appoint a German bishop to try the\r\ncase and to convince him of his error he would be willing to retract\r\nhis theses, to submit to the Church, and to advise all his supporters\r\nto remain loyal to the Holy See. At the same time he prepared a letter\r\nfor transmission to Rome, in which he addressed the Pope in the most\r\nrespectful terms, declaring as on oath before God and creatures that\r\nit never entered into his mind to attack in any way the authority of\r\nthe Roman Church or of the Pope, that he confessed willingly that in\r\nthis Church was vested supreme jurisdiction, and that neither in\r\nheaven or on earth was there anything he should put before it except\r\nJesus Christ the Lord of all things.[17] Throughout these proceedings\r\nit is clear that Luther meant only to deceive Miltitz and to lull the\r\nsuspicions of the Roman authorities, until the seed he had planted\r\nshould have taken root. Only a short time before he had written to a\r\nfriend, hinting that the Pope was the real Anti-Christ mentioned by\r\nSt. Paul in the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, and asserting his\r\nability to prove that he who ruled at the Roman Court was worse than\r\nthe Turk.[18]\r\n\r\nSeveral months passed and no further steps were taken by Rome to meet\r\nthe crisis. This delay was due in great measure to the death of\r\nMaximilian I. (1519), and to the sharp contest that ensued. The two\r\nstrongest candidates were Charles I., King of Spain, who as son of\r\nPhilip the Handsome (son of Maximilian), and of Joanna of Castile\r\n(daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella), was ruler of Spain, the\r\nNetherlands, Austria, and Naples, and Francis I., King of France. For\r\ncenturies the Pope had striven to prevent the union of Naples and the\r\nEmpire, and with good reason, for such a union must prove almost of\r\nnecessity highly detrimental to the safety of the Papal States and the\r\nindependence of the Holy See. For this reason, if for no other, Leo X.\r\ndid not favour the candidature of Charles. Nor could he induce himself\r\nto display any enthusiasm for the cause of Francis I., whose\r\nintervention in Italian affairs the Pope had good grounds to dread. As\r\nagainst the two the Pope endeavoured to induce the princes to elect\r\none of their own number, preferably the Elector of Saxony. But the\r\nElector showed no anxiety to accept such a responsible office, and in\r\nthe end Charles succeeded in winning over to his side the majority of\r\nthe princes. He was elected and proclaimed Emperor under the title of\r\nCharles V. (1519).\r\n\r\nWhile Rome remained inactive, and while the opponents of Luther in\r\nGermany were handicapped by the crude diplomacy of Miltitz, Luther was\r\ngaining ground with marvellous rapidity. His success was due partly to\r\nhis own great personal gifts as a popular demagogue, and partly also\r\nto the fact that no man knew better than he how to make capital out of\r\nthe ecclesiastical abuses of the time, and to win to his side all who\r\nhad any reason to be discontented with the existing order. He was\r\nstrengthened very much by the inactivity of the German bishops, who\r\nseemed unwilling to take any severe measures against him, by the help\r\nand encouragement of Frederick of Saxony, who, during the interregnum\r\nand for some time after the election of Charles V. was the real\r\nadministrator of Germany, by his union with the leading Humanist\r\nscholars and professors, especially Erasmus, all of whom regarded\r\nLuther merely as the champion of liberty against the obscurantism of\r\nthe Scholastics, and by his secret alliances with discontented nobles,\r\nsuch as Ulrich von Hutten and Franz von Sickingen, whose sole hope of\r\nimproving their fortunes lay in the creation of public disorder.\r\n\r\nJohann Eck, Luther's chief opponent, realising that there was no hope\r\nof stirring up the German authorities to take action, hastened to Rome\r\nto impress upon the Pope and his advisers the extreme gravity of the\r\nsituation, and to urge them to proceed against the revolt with all\r\npossible energy and despatch. Luther himself recognised clearly enough\r\nthat the crisis he had long foreseen was at hand, and he began to\r\nprepare men's minds for complete rupture with the Church by his sermon\r\non excommunication in which he bade defiance to the ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities. He threw himself with renewed energy into the fray,\r\nturning out volume after volume with feverish rapidity, each more\r\nviolent and abusive than its predecessor, and nearly all couched in\r\nlanguage that was as intelligible to the peasant as it was to the\r\nprofessor. In his /Address to the Nobles of Germany/, in his works /On\r\nthe Mass/, /On the Improvement of Christian Morality/, and /On the\r\nBabylonian Captivity/, he proclaimed himself a political as well as a\r\nreligious revolutionary. There was no longer any concealment or\r\nequivocation. The veil was lifted at last, and Luther stood forth to\r\nthe world as the declared enemy of the Church and the Pope, the\r\nchampion of the Bible as the sole rule of faith, and the defender of\r\nindividual judgment as its only interpreter. In these works he\r\nrejected the Mass, Transubstantiation, vows of chastity, pilgrimages,\r\nfasts, the Sacraments, the powers of the priesthood, and the\r\njurisdiction and supremacy of the Pope. With such a man there could be\r\nno longer any question of leniency or of compromise. The issues at\r\nstake, namely, whether the wild and impassioned assertions of a rebel\r\nmonk should be accepted in preference to the teaching of Christ's\r\nChurch, ought to have been apparent to every thinking man; and yet so\r\nblinded were some of his contemporaries by their sympathy with the\r\nHumanists as against the Theologians, that even still they forced\r\nthemselves to believe Luther sought only for reform.\r\n\r\nAt Rome the trouble in Germany was one of the main subjects that\r\nengaged the attention of the Curia. It was felt that the time had come\r\nwhen decisive measures must be taken. After long and anxious\r\ndeliberations Leo X. published the Bull, /Exsurge Domine/ (June 1520),\r\nin which forty propositions taken from Luther's writings were\r\ncondemned, his works were ordered to be burned, the full penalties of\r\nexcommunication were proclaimed against him unless he withdrew his\r\nerrors and made his submission within sixty days, while his aiders and\r\nabettors were besought in the most touching terms to abandon the\r\ndangerous path into which they had been betrayed. Had such a\r\npronouncement been issued at the beginning of the movement it might\r\nhave done much to restore peace to the Church, but, coming as it did\r\nat a time when Luther's movement, backed by all the revolutionary\r\nforces of Germany, had already acquired considerable dimensions, it\r\nfailed to put an end to the tumult. Besides, the papal decision was\r\ndeprived of much of its force by the fact that Eck, Caraccioli, and\r\nAleandro were appointed as a commission to superintend its execution.\r\nThe appointment of Eck was a great tactical blunder, as it afforded\r\nLuther and his friends an opportunity of proclaiming that the sentence\r\nof excommunication was procured by the intrigues and\r\nmisrepresentations of their personal enemies; while the fact that the\r\nGerman bishops were disregarded in the execution of the Bull as if\r\nthey were not above suspicion themselves, was looked upon by many as\r\na studied insult to the entire German hierarchy. Even though Luther\r\nhad entertained any thoughts of submission, the triumph of Eck would\r\nhave created very serious obstacles; but, knowing as he did, that even\r\nat the worst he could reckon upon the support of a certain number of\r\nthe discontented nobles who had pledged themselves to put their swords\r\nat his disposal, he had no intention of making his submission.\r\n\r\nThe reception accorded to the papal document varied according to the\r\nviews of the local authorities and the state of public feeling in the\r\ndifferent cities and provinces. Thus, while its publication was\r\nwelcomed in Cologne, Mainz, Halberstadt, and Freising, it was received\r\nwith very mixed feelings at Leipzig and at Erfurt. Frederick of\r\nSaxony, to whom Leo X. had addressed a personal appeal, refused to\r\nabandon Luther's cause unless it were proved from the Scriptures that\r\nhe was wrong. He did, indeed, suggest that Luther should write a\r\nrespectful letter to the Pope, but his suggestion passed unheeded. At\r\nfirst Luther pretended that the Bull was a forgery brought forward by\r\nEck to discredit him, but when this line of defence proved useless, he\r\nboldly attacked the papal pronouncement in his pamphlet, /Against the\r\nBull of Anti-Christ/, in which he denounced Leo X. as a heretic and\r\napostate, an enemy of the Holy Scriptures, a tyrant, and a\r\ncalumniator. Lest, however, the courage of his supporters might be\r\novercome by the terrors of excommunication, he issued an appeal from\r\nthe sentence of the Pope to the judgment of a future General Council.\r\nFinally, on the 10th December, 1520, in the presence of an immense\r\nconcourse of the citizens and students of Wittenberg, he burned\r\npublicly the papal Bull and the writings of his political opponents.\r\nOn this occasion he proclaimed his intention of overthrowing the\r\necclesiastical organisation, and of introducing a new theological\r\nsystem. For the future it was to be war to the knife against the Pope\r\nand the Church, and he called upon German patriots and all true\r\nfriends of personal liberty to take their stand by his side in the\r\nconflict that had been begun.\r\n\r\nCharles V. was apparently in a very strong position. Not since the\r\ndays of Charlemagne had any ruler claimed jurisdiction over so wide a\r\nterritory as his, comprising, as it did, Germany and Austria, the\r\nkingdom of the two Sicilies, Spain, and the Netherlands. But in\r\nreality the very extent of his dominions made him much less powerful\r\nthan he might have been as the sovereign of a smaller but more compact\r\nregion. It served to awaken the suspicions of his subjects, who feared\r\nthat he might abolish their distinctive national constitutions and\r\nweld his scattered territories into one great empire, and to excite\r\nthe jealousy of the other rulers of Europe, who imagined that he might\r\ndeclare himself dictator of the western world. The German princes,\r\nhaving resisted successfully all the efforts made by his grandfather,\r\nMaximilian I., to convert the loose confederation of the German States\r\ninto a united and centralised nation, were on their guard lest his\r\nsuccessor should attempt a similar policy with the aid of Spanish\r\ntroops and Spanish gold; the Spaniards resented the absence of the\r\nking from Spain, where many of the lower classes were in a state\r\nbordering on rebellion; Francis I. of France, trembling for the very\r\nexistence of his country, was willing to do all things, even to agree\r\nto an alliance with the sons of Mohammed, if he could only lessen the\r\ninfluence of his powerful rival. The Turks under Soliman I. were\r\ndetermined to realise the dreams of their race by extending their\r\nterritories from the Bosphorus to the Atlantic; while even the Pope\r\nhad good reason to suspect that Charles V., unmindful of the example\r\nof his great namesake, might seek to become the master rather than the\r\nprotector of the Church.[19]\r\n\r\nOn account of the troubles in Spain it was only late in the year 1520\r\nthat Charles V. could come to Germany to meet the electors, and to\r\ntake over formally the administration of the Empire (23 Oct.). Less\r\nthan two weeks had elapsed when the papal representative, Aleandro,\r\nhimself a distinguished Humanist, sought an interview with the new\r\nruler, and besought him to enforce the papal Bull against Luther with\r\nthe full weight of his imperial authority. But the wavering attitude\r\nof many of the princes and the determined opposition of Frederick of\r\nSaxony made the Emperor hesitate to condemn Luther without giving him\r\nan opportunity for explanation and defence. The Diet was soon to open\r\nat Worms, and Charles V. issued an invitation to Luther to attend,\r\nguaranteeing at the same time his personal safety on the way to and\r\nfrom Worms and during his sojourn in the city.\r\n\r\nThe Diet met in January 1521, but despite the efforts of Aleandro the\r\nmajority of the princes still failed to realise the gravity of the\r\nsituation. Feeling against Rome was running very high in Germany at\r\nthe time. Many of the princes insisted on presenting a document\r\nembodying the grievances of Germany (/Centum Gravamina/)[20] to the\r\npapal ambassador, while even such an orthodox supporter of the Church\r\nas Duke George of Saxony, brought forward very serious complaints\r\nagainst the clergy, accompanied by a demand that a General Council\r\nshould be summoned to restore peace to the Church. Luther,\r\nstrengthened by the safe conduct of the Emperor and by a secret\r\nunderstanding with some of the princes and knights, set out from\r\nWittenberg for Worms, where he arrived in April 1521. On presenting\r\nhimself before the Diet he was invited to state if he were really the\r\nauthor of the works published under his name, copies of which were\r\npresented to him, and, if so, was he willing to retract the doctrines\r\ncontained in them. In reply to the former of these questions he\r\nadmitted the authorship of the volumes, but asked for time to consider\r\nwhat answer he should make in regard to the latter. A day was allowed\r\nhim for consideration. When he appeared again, all traces of the\r\nhesitation and nervousness that marked his attitude at the previous\r\nsession had disappeared. He refused to retract his opinions, and made\r\nit clear that he no longer acknowledged the authority of the Pope or\r\nof General Councils as a safe guide in matters religious.\r\n\r\nThereupon the Emperor intimated to the princes that he was determined\r\nto take vigorous action against such a heretic and disturber of the\r\npublic peace, though at the request of some of the princes he allowed\r\ntime for private conferences between Luther and representative\r\nCatholic theologians, notably Eck and Cochlaeus.[21] These conferences\r\nhaving failed to produce any result the Emperor issued an order (25th\r\nApril) commanding Luther to depart from Worms without delay, and\r\nforbidding him to preach to the people on his journey under pain of\r\nforfeiting his safe conduct. A month later Charles V. published a\r\ndecree placing Luther under the ban of the Empire. He was denounced as\r\na public heretic whom no one should receive or support; he was to be\r\nseized by any one who could do so, and delivered to the Emperor; his\r\nwritings were to be burned, and all persons proved guilty of\r\ncountenancing himself or his errors were liable to severe punishment.\r\nMany hoped that the decree might put an end to the confusion, but in\r\nreality Charles V. was powerless to enforce it, especially as the\r\nmajority of the princes were unwilling to carry out its terms in their\r\nterritories. Hence, outside the hereditary dominions of the House of\r\nHabsburg, the lands of Joachim I. of Brandenburg and of Duke George of\r\nSaxony, and in Bavaria, it remained a dead letter.\r\n\r\nOn the route from Worms Luther was taken prisoner by soldiers of the\r\nElector, Frederick of Saxony, according to arrangements that had been\r\nmade for his protection, and was brought to the castle at Wartburg\r\nwhere he remained for close on a year (May 1521-March 1522) under the\r\nassumed name of Yonker George, safe in spite of the imperial decrees.\r\nIn the silence of his retreat at Wartburg Luther had an opportunity\r\nfor reflection on the gravity of the situation that he had created. At\r\ntimes he trembled, as he thought of separating himself definitely from\r\nthe great world-wide organisation which recognised the jurisdiction of\r\nthe Bishop of Rome, and of setting up his own judgment against the\r\nfaith that had been handed down for centuries, and that was supported\r\nby the ablest scholars from the days of Clement of Rome to those of\r\nSt. Thomas and St. Bonaventure.\r\n\r\nIn his anxiety of mind he was the victim of hallucinations, believing\r\nthat the spirit of evil appeared to him in visible form, and held\r\ncommune with him in human speech. He was assailed, too, with violent\r\ntemptations of the flesh, which reduced him to a state bordering on\r\ndespair. But these moments of depression passed away, to be succeeded\r\nby fits of wild exultation in which he rejoiced at the storm that he\r\nhad created already, and at the still greater storm he was soon to\r\ncreate. He set to work with tireless energy, believing himself to be\r\ninspired from on high as was the apostle, St. John, during his stay in\r\nthe island of Patmos. At the instigation of his friends, who urged him\r\nto attack the celibacy of the monks and nuns, he turned his attention\r\nto this question, and issued a work /On Monastic Vows/, in which he\r\ndeclared that such vows of chastity, being opposed to the freedom of\r\nthe Gospel, were sinful and should be neglected. In his book /On the\r\nMass/ he assailed the Mass and the whole theory of the Christian\r\npriesthood, declaring that every believer was in a true sense a\r\npriest. He poured out a most violent torrent of abuse against Henry\r\nVIII. of England, who, in his /Defence of the Seven Sacraments/, had\r\nventured to join issue with the German reformer. At the same time he\r\nundertook to prepare a translation of the New Testament as a means of\r\nadvancing his propaganda. By aid of mis-translations and marginal\r\nnotes he sought to popularise his views on Faith and Justification,\r\nand to win favour with the people by opening to them the word of God,\r\nwhich he asserted falsely had been closed against them for centuries.\r\n\r\nAll his pamphlets were couched in popular language and were exactly\r\nthe kind of works likely to appeal to the masses of the people, as\r\nwell as to the debased instincts of those who had entered into the\r\nreligious state in response to the wishes of their parents or\r\nguardians rather than in obedience to the call of God. But while\r\nLuther thus catered for the multitude, Melanchthon sought to gain the\r\nsupport of the more educated classes by throwing Luther's teaching\r\ninto scientific and systematic form in his work, /Loci Communes/\r\n(1521), a book that remained for centuries the standard authority on\r\nLutheran teaching.\r\n\r\nIt would be wrong to assume that Luther developed his theological\r\nsystem in its entirety before his separation from the Church. On the\r\nquestion of Justification and Free-will he had arrived at views\r\ndistinctly opposed to Catholic doctrine, but his system as such took\r\nshape only gradually in response to the attacks of his opponents or\r\nthe demands of his friends. On the one hand, imbued with the ideas of\r\nGerman Pantheistic mysticism, Luther started with the fixed principle\r\nthat man's action is controlled by necessary laws, and that even after\r\njustification man is completely devoid of free will at least in\r\nreligious matters. According to him, human nature became so\r\nessentially maimed and corrupted by the sin of Adam that every work\r\nwhich man can do is and must be sinful, because it proceeds in some\r\nway from concupiscence. Hence it is, he asserted, that good works are\r\nuseless in acquiring justification, which can be obtained only by\r\nfaith; and by faith he understood not the mere intellectual assent to\r\nrevealed doctrines, but a practical confidence, resulting, no doubt,\r\nfrom this assent, that the merits of Christ will be applied to the\r\nsoul. Through this faith the sinner seizes upon the righteousness of\r\nChrist, and by applying to himself the justice of his Saviour his sins\r\nare covered up. For this reason Luther explained that justification\r\ndid not mean the actual forgiveness of sin by the infusion of some\r\ninternal habit called sanctifying grace, but only the non-imputation\r\nof the guilt on account of the merits of Christ.\r\n\r\nSince faith alone is necessary for justification it followed as a\r\nlogical consequence that there was no place in Luther's system for the\r\nSacraments, though in deference to old traditions he retained three\r\nSacraments, Baptism, Penance, and the Eucharist. These, however, as he\r\ntook care to explain, do not produce grace in the soul. They are mere\r\noutward pledges that the receiver has the faith without which he\r\ncannot be justified. Having in this way rejected the sacramental\r\nsystem and the sacrificial character of the Mass, it was only natural\r\nthat he should disregard the priesthood, and proclaim that all\r\nbelievers were priests. In harmony with his theory on justification,\r\nand its dependence on faith, he denounced Purgatory, Prayers for the\r\nDead, Indulgences, and Invocation of the Saints as being in themselves\r\nderogatory to the merits of Christ.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, he laid it down as the leading principle that the\r\nBible was the sole rule of faith, and that individual judgment was its\r\nonly interpreter. Consequently he rejected the idea of a visible\r\nauthority set up by Christ as an infallible guide in religious\r\naffairs. In this way he sought to undermine the authority of the\r\nChurch, to depreciate the value of the decrees of the Popes and\r\nGeneral Councils, and to re-assure his less daring followers by\r\nstripping ecclesiastical censures of more than half their terrors.[22]\r\n\r\nThe results of Luther's literary activity were soon apparent at\r\nWittenberg and other centres in Germany. The Augustinians in Luther's\r\nown convent set aside their vows as worthless, and rejected the Mass.\r\nCarlstadt made common cause with the most radical element in the city,\r\ncelebrated Mass on Christmas morning in the German language (1521),\r\nand administered Holy Communion to every one who came forward to\r\nreceive, without any inquiry about their spiritual condition. Putting\r\nhimself at the head of a body of students and roughs he went round the\r\nchurches destroying the pictures, statues, confessionals, and altars.\r\nTo increase the confusion a party of men at Zwickau led by a\r\nshoemaker, Nicholas Storch, and a preacher, Thomas Munzer, following\r\nthe principle of private judgment advocated by Luther, insisted on\r\nfaith as a condition for baptism and rejected infant baptism as\r\nworthless. They were called Anabaptists. They claimed to be special\r\nmessengers from God, gifted with the power of working miracles, and\r\nfavoured with visions from on high. In vain did Luther attack them as\r\nheretics, and exhort his lieutenants to suppress them as being more\r\ndangerous than the Papists. Carlstadt, unable to answer their\r\narguments from Scripture, went over to their side, and even\r\nMelanchthon felt so shaken in his opposition that he appealed to\r\nWartburg for guidance. The students at the university became so\r\nrestless and turbulent that Duke George of Saxony began to take the\r\nprompt and decisive action necessary for dealing with such a dangerous\r\nsituation. Luther, alarmed for the future of his work, abandoned his\r\nretreat at Wartburg (March 1522) and returned to Wittenberg, where he\r\nhad recourse to stern measures to put an end to the confusion. He\r\ndrove Carlstadt from the city, and even followed him to other places\r\nwhere he tried to find refuge, till at last, after a very disedifying\r\nscene between them in a public tavern, he forced him to flee from\r\nSaxony. Carlstadt's greatest offence in the eyes of his master was his\r\npreaching against the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist, though\r\nLuther himself admitted that he should have liked to deny the Real\r\nPresence if only to annoy the Pope, were it not that the words of\r\nScripture proved too strong. Carlstadt adopted a different\r\ninterpretation, but Luther was not the man to tolerate individual\r\njudgment in the case of one of his own lieutenants. Carlstadt was\r\ndenounced as a heretic and a blasphemer, for whom no punishment could\r\nbe sufficiently severe. Munzer, too, was banished, and with the\r\nassistance of the Elector, Luther was enabled to overcome all his\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\nLuther owed his success in the opening years of his campaign mainly to\r\nhis ability in gauging the feelings of the different classes whose\r\nsupport he wished to obtain, as well as to his complete mastery of the\r\nGerman language. In appealing to the monks and nuns, who were longing\r\nto escape from the obligations they had contracted, he offered them\r\ncomplete liberty by denouncing their vows as opposed to the freedom of\r\nthe Gospel and consequently sinful. Many of the monks and nuns\r\nabandoned their cloisters and fled to Wittenberg to seek the pleasures\r\ndenied them hitherto, and to put in practice Luther's teaching on the\r\nnecessity of marriage. Though he encouraged bishops and priests to\r\nmarry, and though he forwarded his warmest congratulations to\r\nCarlstadt on his betrothal to a fifteen year old maiden (1522), Luther\r\nhimself hesitated long before taking his final plunge; but at last,\r\nagainst the advice of his best friends, he took as his wife Catherine\r\nBora, one of the escaped nuns who had sought refuge in Wittenberg. His\r\nmarriage (1525) was a source of amusement to his opponents as it was\r\nof dismay to his supporters. Melanchthon complained bitterly of the\r\nstep his master had taken, but he consoled himself with the thought\r\nthat the marriage might out an end to his former frivolity, and might\r\nallay the suspicions that his conduct had aroused.[23] To the princes,\r\nthe free cities, and the landless knights he appealed by holding out\r\nhopes that they might be enriched by a division of the ecclesiastical\r\nestates and of the goods of the monasteries and churches. With the\r\noverthrow of the Pope and of the bishops the princes were led to\r\nexpect that they might themselves become spiritual dictators in their\r\nown dominions. To the friends of the Humanist movement and the great\r\nbody of the professors and students he represented himself as the\r\nchampion of learning and intellectual freedom, anxious to defend them\r\nagainst the obscurantism of the Scholastics and the interference of\r\nthe Roman congregations.\r\n\r\nA large number of the leading Humanists, believing that Luther had\r\nundertaken only a campaign against universally recognised abuses, were\r\ninclined at first to sympathise with his movement. The friendly\r\nattitude they adopted, and the influence employed by Erasmus and\r\nothers on his behalf during the early years of his revolt contributed\r\nnot a little to his final success. But as it became evident that his\r\nobject was the overthrow of the Church and of doctrines accepted as\r\ndogmas of faith by the whole Christian world, his former allies fell\r\naway one by one. On the question of free-will Erasmus, who had long\r\nplayed a double role, found it necessary to take the field openly\r\nagainst him.[24] Luther's answer, full of personal abuse and\r\ninvective, drew a sharp reply from Erasmus, and all friendly\r\nintercourse between them was broken off for ever.\r\n\r\nBut it was on the mass of the people, the peasants and the artisans,\r\nthat Luther relied mainly for support, and it was to these he\r\naddressed his most forcible appeals. The peasants of Germany, ground\r\ndown by heavy taxes and reduced to the position of slaves, were ready\r\nto listen to the revolutionary ideas put forward by leaders like\r\nSickingen and von Hutten, and to respond to the call of Luther to rise\r\nagainst their princes whether they were secular or ecclesiastical. In\r\nthe imagination of the peasants Luther appeared as the friend of human\r\nliberty, determined to deliver them from the intolerable yoke that had\r\nbeen laid upon them by their masters. His attacks were confined at\r\nfirst to the prince-bishops and abbots, but soon realising the\r\nstrength of the weapon he wielded, he attacked the lay princes in the\r\npamphlets entitled /Christian Liberty/ and /The Secular Magistracy/,\r\nand advocated the complete overthrow of all authority. It is true,\r\nundoubtedly, that many of the peasants were already enrolled in the\r\nsecret societies, and that had there never been a Luther a popular\r\nrising might have been anticipated; but his doctrines on evangelical\r\nfreedom and his frenzied onslaughts on the ecclesiastical and lay\r\nrulers, turned the movement into an anti-religious channel, and\r\nimparted to the struggle a uniformity and bitterness that otherwise it\r\ncould never have acquired.\r\n\r\nRisings of the peasantry took place in various parts of Germany,\r\nnotably in Swabia, Thuringia, the Rhine Provinces, and Saxony (1524).\r\nThomas Munzer, the leader of the Anabaptists, encouraged them in their\r\nfight for freedom. At first the attack was directed principally\r\nagainst the spiritual princes. Many monasteries and churches were\r\nplundered, and several of the nobles were put to death. Soon the lay\r\nprinces of Germany, alarmed by the course of the revolutionaries and\r\nfearing for the safety of their own territories, assembled their\r\nforces and marched against the insurgents. The war was carried on\r\nmercilessly on both sides, close upon 100,000 peasants being killed in\r\nthe field, while many of their leaders, amongst them Thomas Munzer,\r\nwere arrested and condemned to death. In nearly every important\r\nengagement the peasants, as might be expected, suffered defeat, so\r\nthat before the end of 1525 the movement was, practically speaking, at\r\nan end. Luther, who had been consulted by both sides, and who had\r\ntried to avoid committing himself to either, frightened by the very\r\nviolence of the storm he had been instrumental in creating, issued an\r\nappeal to the princes calling upon them to show no mercy to the forces\r\nof disorder,[25] and even Melanchthon, gentle and moderate as he\r\nusually was, did not hesitate to declare that the peasants of Germany\r\nhad more liberty than should be allowed to such a rude and uncultured\r\npeople. The Peasants' War, disastrous as it was, did some good by\r\nopening men's eyes to the dangerous consequences of Luther's\r\nextravagant harangues, and by giving some slight indications as to the\r\nreal character and methods of the man, who was posing as a heaven-sent\r\nreformer and at the same time as a champion of popular liberty.\r\n\r\nBut though Luther lost ground in many quarters owing to the part he\r\nplayed before and during the Peasants' War, he had no intention of\r\nabandoning the struggle in despair. During the early years of his\r\ncampaign his mind was so engrossed with the overthrow of existing\r\nreligious institutions, that he had little time to consider how he\r\nshould rebuild what he had pulled down. At first he thought that no\r\nvisible organisation was necessary, as the Church, according to his\r\nview, consisted of all those who had true faith and charity. But soon\r\nhe abandoned this idea in favour of district or local churches that\r\nshould be left completely independent. The disturbances in Germany\r\nduring the Peasants' War taught him the hopelessness of such a scheme,\r\nand showed him that his only chance of permanent success lay in the\r\norganisation of state churches to be placed under the protection and\r\nauthority of the civil rulers. By this bribe he hoped to conciliate\r\nthe princes, whom he had antagonised by his attacks on their own body\r\nas well as by his attitude during the early stages of the disturbance.\r\nThe Elector John of Saxony, who had succeeded his brother Frederick,\r\nhesitated at first to assist him in the momentous work of setting up a\r\nrival Christian organisation. But, at last, mindful of the advantages\r\nthat would accrue to him from being recognised as supreme head of the\r\nChurch in his own dominions, he gave a reluctant consent to the plans\r\nformulated by Luther.\r\n\r\nA body of visitors consisting of clerics and lawyers was appointed to\r\ndraw up a new ecclesiastical constitution, the most noteworthy feature\r\nof which was the complete dependence of the new church on the secular\r\nauthority of each state. Episcopal jurisdiction was rejected, and in\r\nplace of the bishops, superintendents were appointed. The ordinary\r\nadministration was to be carried out by a synod of clerics and laymen\r\nelected by the various parishes, but, in reality, the right of\r\nappointment, of taxation, of apportioning the temporal goods, and of\r\ndeciding legal difficulties passed under the control of the sovereign.\r\nStrange to say, though Luther insisted on individual judgment during\r\nhis campaign against the Catholic Church, he had no difficulty in\r\nurging the civil rulers to force all their subjects to join the new\r\nreligious body. The goods of the Catholic Church were to be\r\nappropriated, some of them being set aside for the support of the new\r\nreligious organisation, while the greater portion of them found their\r\nway into the royal treasury. The Mass, shorn of the Elevation and of\r\neverything that would imply the idea of sacrifice, was translated into\r\nthe German language, so that in all solemn religious services the\r\nplace of the Sacrifice was taken by the hymns, Scriptural lessons, the\r\nsermon, and the Lord's Supper. Melanchthon wrote a Visitation Book\r\n(1527) for the guidance of Lutheran ministers, and Luther himself\r\npublished two catechisms for the instruction of the children. The\r\nLutheran church was organised on a similar plan in Hesse and\r\nBrandenburg and in many of the free cities such as Nurnberg,\r\nMagdeburg, Bremen, Frankfurt, Ulm, etc. By these measures the\r\nseparation was completed definitely, and a certain amount of unity was\r\nensured for the new religion.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, how fared it with the Emperor and the Pope? Shortly after\r\nthe Diet of Nurnberg (1522) Charles V. left Germany for the\r\nNetherlands. Owing to the troubles in Spain and the long drawn out war\r\nwith France he was unable to give any attention to the progress of\r\naffairs in Germany. The administration of the Empire was committed to\r\nthree representatives, the ablest of whom was the Elector Frederick of\r\nSaxony, the friend and patron of Luther. The result was that Luther\r\nhad a free hand to spread his views notwithstanding the decree of\r\nWorms.\r\n\r\nLeo X. died in 1521 and was succeeded by Adrian VI. (1522-3), a former\r\ntutor of the Emperor. As a Hollander it might be anticipated that his\r\nrepresentations to the German princes would prove more effective than\r\nthose of his Italian predecessor, particularly as not even his worst\r\nenemies could discover anything worthy of reproach either in his\r\nprinciples or personal conduct. Convinced that Luther's only chance of\r\nwinning support lay in his exaggerated denunciations of real or\r\nimaginary abuses, he determined to bring about a complete reform,\r\nfirst in Rome itself and then throughout the entire Christian world.\r\nOwing to his ill-disguised contempt for all that was dear to the heart\r\nof the Humanist Leo X., and to the severe measures taken by him to\r\nreduce expenses at the Roman Court, he encountered great opposition in\r\nRome, and incurred the dislike both of officials and people.\r\n\r\nWhen he learned that a Diet was to be held at Nurnberg (1522) to\r\nconsider plans for the defence of the Empire against the Turks who had\r\nconquered Belgrade, he despatched Chieregati as his nuncio to invite\r\nthe princes to enforce the decree of Worms, and to restore peace to\r\nthe Church by putting down the Lutheran movement. In his letters to\r\nindividual members of the Diet and in his instructions to the nuncio,\r\nwhich were read publicly to the assembled representatives, Adrian VI.\r\nadmitted the existence of grave abuses both in Rome itself and in\r\nnearly every part of the church.[26] He promised, however, to do\r\neverything that in him lay to bring about a complete and thorough\r\nreform.\r\n\r\nThese admissions served only to strengthen the hands of Luther and his\r\nsupporters, who pointed to them as a justification for the whole\r\nmovement, and to provide the princes with a plausible explanation of\r\ntheir inactivity in giving effect to the decree of Worms. The princes\r\nrefused to carry out the decree of Worms, alleging as an excuse the\r\ndanger of popular commotion. They brought forward once more the\r\ngrievances of the German nation against Rome (/Centum Gravamina/),\r\ninsisted on a General Council being called to restore peace to the\r\nChurch, and held out a vague hope that an effort would be made to\r\nprevent the spread of the new doctrine till the Council should be\r\nconvoked.\r\n\r\nThe papal nuncio, dissatisfied with the attitude of the\r\nrepresentatives, withdrew from the Diet before the formal reply was\r\ndelivered to him. Adrian VI., cognisant of the failure of his efforts\r\nand wearied by the opposition of the Romans to whom his reforms were\r\ndispleasing, made a last fruitless effort to win over Frederick of\r\nSaxony to his side. The news that the island of Rhodes, for the\r\ndefence of which he had laboured and prayed so strenuously, had fallen\r\ninto the hands of the Turks, served to complete his affliction and to\r\nbring him to a premature grave. He died in September 1523 to the great\r\ndelight of the Romans, who could barely conceal their rejoicing even\r\nwhen he lay on his bed of death. He was an excellent Pope, though\r\nperhaps not sufficiently circumspect for the critical times in which\r\nhe lived. Had he been elected a century earlier, and had he been given\r\nan opportunity of carrying out reforms, as had been given to some of\r\nhis predecessors, the Lutheran movement would have been an\r\nimpossibility.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by Clement VII. (1523-34). The new Pope was a\r\nrelative of Leo X., and, like him, a patron of literature and art. He\r\nwas a man of blameless life and liberal views, and endowed with great\r\nprudence and tact, but his excessive caution and want of firmness led\r\nto the ruin of his best-conceived plans and to the failure of his\r\ngeneral policy. He despatched Cardinal Campeggio as his legate to the\r\nDiet of Nurnberg (1524). Once again the princes of Germany closed\r\ntheir ears to the appeal of the Pope, refused to take energetic\r\nmeasures to enforce the decree of Worms, and talked of establishing a\r\ncommission to consider the grievances of their nation against Rome,\r\nand to inquire into the religious issues that had been raised.\r\nCampeggio, feeling that it was hopeless to expect assistance from the\r\nDiet, turned to the individual princes. He succeeded in bringing about\r\nan alliance at Ratisbon (1524) between the rulers of Austria, Bavaria,\r\nand several of the ecclesiastical princes of Southern Germany for the\r\npurpose of opposing the new teaching and safeguarding the interests of\r\nthe Catholic Church. A similar alliance of the Catholic princes of\r\nNorthern Germany was concluded at Dessau in 1526. At the same time the\r\nprinces who were favourable to Lutheran views, notably Philip of\r\nHesse, John, Elector of Saxony, the rulers of Brandenburg, Prussia,\r\nMecklenburg and Mansfeld, together with the representatives of the\r\ncities of Brunswick and Mecklenburg, met and pledged themselves to\r\nmake common cause, were any attempt made by the Emperor or the\r\nCatholic princes to suppress Luther's doctrine by force. In this way\r\nGermany was being divided gradually into two hostile camps.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Charles V., whose presence in Germany might have\r\nexercised a restraining influence, was so engrossed in the life and\r\ndeath struggle with France that he had no time to follow the progress\r\nof the religious revolt. To complicate the issue still more, Clement\r\nVII., who had been friendly to the Emperor for some time after his\r\nelection, alarmed lest the freedom of the Papal States and of the Holy\r\nSee might be endangered were the French driven completely from the\r\npeninsula, took sides openly against Charles V. and formed an alliance\r\nwith his opponent. The good fortune that had smiled on the French arms\r\nsuddenly deserted them. In 1525 Francis I. was defeated at Pavia and\r\ntaken as prisoner to Spain, where he was forced to accept the terms\r\ndictated to him by his victorious rival. On his release in 1526 he\r\nrefused to abide by the terms of the Treaty, and a new alliance,\r\nconsisting of the Pope, France, England, Venice, Florence, Milan, and\r\nSwitzerland was formed against Charles V. Disturbances, fomented by\r\nthe Italian supporters of the Emperor, broke out in the Papal States,\r\nand a German army led by the Prince of Bourbon marched on Rome without\r\nthe knowledge of Charles, captured the city, plundered its treasures,\r\nand for several days wreaked a terrible vengeance on the citizens.\r\nCharles, who was in Spain at the time, was deeply grieved when the\r\nnews was brought to him of the havoc that had been wrought by his\r\nsubordinates. A temporary peace was concluded immediately between the\r\nEmperor and the Pope, and the peace of Barcelona in 1529 put an end to\r\nthis unholy strife. About the same time the hostilities between\r\nCharles and Francis I. were brought to a conclusion by the Peace of\r\nCambrai, and the Emperor, having been crowned by the Pope at Bologna\r\n(1530), was free at last to turn his attention to the religious\r\nrevolution in Germany.[27]\r\n\r\nDuring the struggle between Charles V. and the Pope the Lutheran\r\nprinces had a free hand to do as they pleased, and, indeed, at one\r\ntime they were not without hope that Charles might be induced to place\r\nhimself at their head. Besides, owing to the fact that the Turks were\r\nadvancing on Hungary and were likely to overrun the hereditary\r\ndominions of the House of Habsburg, they felt confident that no\r\nattempt could be made to suppress Lutheranism by force. At the Diet of\r\nSpeier, in 1526, John Duke of Saxony, and Philip of Hesse adopted so\r\nviolent and unconciliatory an attitude that Germany was on the brink\r\nof civil war, had not the Archduke Ferdinand, alarmed by the success\r\nof the Turks, used all his powers to prevent a division. It was agreed\r\nthat both sides should unite against the Turks, that a Council should\r\nbe called within a year to discuss the religious difficulties, and\r\nthat in the meantime individual rulers were free to enforce or\r\ndisregard the decree of Worms as they wished.\r\n\r\nThese concessions, wrung from the Catholic princes owing to the fear\r\nof Turkish invasion, did not satisfy either party. False rumours were\r\nspread among the Protestant princes that Duke George of Saxony and\r\nother Catholic rulers intended to have recourse to arms, and though\r\nthe Duke was able to clear himself of the charge, the relations\r\nbetween the two parties became gradually more strained. In 1526 the\r\nTurks overcame the Hungarians and Bohemians at Mohacz, and advancing\r\ninto Austria were encamped under the very walls of Vienna. It became\r\nnecessary to summon another Diet at Speier (1529). The Catholic\r\nprinces were in the majority, and the knowledge, that the Emperor had\r\nconcluded peace with France and the Pope and was now ready to support\r\nthem, rendered them less willing to accept dictation. It was carried\r\nby a majority that the Emperor should endeavour to have a Council\r\nconvoked within a year, that in the meantime the rulers in whose\r\nterritories the decree of Worms had been in force should continue to\r\nenforce it, and that in the states where the new teaching had taken\r\nroot the rulers were at liberty to allow it to continue, but, in the\r\ninterval before the Council they should permit no further changes to\r\nbe introduced. Nobody should be allowed to preach against the\r\nSacrament of the Altar; the Mass should be celebrated if it had not\r\nbeen abolished, and if abolished no one should be punished for\r\ncelebrating or attending it, and the Scripture should be expounded\r\naccording to the traditional interpretation of the Church.\r\n\r\nThe Lutheran party objected strongly to this decree, and as their\r\nobjections were over-ruled they submitted a formal protest, on account\r\nof which they received the distinctive title of Protestants.[28] The\r\nprotest, signed by the Elector of Saxony, the Margrave of Brandenburg,\r\nthe Dukes of Brunswick-Luneburg, Philip of Hesse, and the\r\nrepresentatives of fourteen cities, having failed to produce any\r\neffect on the Diet, a deputation was appointed to interview the\r\nEmperor and to place their grievances before him. But Charles V.,\r\nmindful of his imperial oath, refused to allow himself to be\r\nintimidated. He warned the deputation that he and the Catholic princes\r\nhad also their duties to fulfil towards God and the Church, and that\r\nuntil a Council should assemble they must obey the decrees of the\r\nDiet. In January 1530 he convened a new Diet to meet at Augsburg at\r\nwhich he himself promised to be present.\r\n\r\nThe Diet was convened to meet at Augsburg in April 1530, but it was\r\nthe middle of June before the Emperor, accompanied by the papal\r\nlegate, made his formal entrance into the city. On the following day\r\nthe feast of Corpus Christi was celebrated with the customary\r\nsolemnities, and the Emperor was pained deeply when he learned that\r\nthe Protestant princes refused to be present or to take any part in\r\nthe function. At the opening of the Diet it was agreed that the\r\nreligious question should take precedence, and the Protestant princes\r\nwere invited to make a clear statement of their doctrines and demands.\r\nLuther himself could not be present on account of the decree of Worms,\r\nand hence the duty of preparing a complete exposition of the\r\nProtestant doctrine devolved upon the ablest of his lieutenants,\r\nPhilip Melanchthon. He drew up and presented to the Diet the document\r\nknown as the /Augsburg Confession/ (/Confessio Augustana/), accepted\r\nby Luther himself as a masterly though perhaps too moderate statement\r\nof the new teaching. The Confession was divided into two parts, the\r\nformer of which consisted of twenty-one articles or dogmas of faith\r\nreceived by himself and his friends; the latter dwelt with what he\r\ntermed abuses which they rejected, notable amongst these being\r\ncelibacy of the clergy, monastic vows, auricular confession, private\r\nmasses, communion under one kind, abstinence, and episcopal\r\ngovernment. The Confession was drawn up very skilfully, great\r\nprominence being given to the doctrines on which all Christians were\r\nagreed, while the distinctive tenets of the Protestant reformers were\r\nput forward in their mildest and least offensive form. The document\r\nwas read to the Diet in German by Bayer, Chancellor of the Elector of\r\nSaxony, and undoubtedly it produced a marked impression on the\r\nassembly. The Emperor held a conference with the Catholic princes,\r\nsome of whom advocated prompt recourse to the sternest measures.\r\nOthers, however, amongst them being several of the ecclesiastical\r\nprinces, misled by the temperate and, in a certain sense, misleading\r\ncharacter of Melanchthon's statement, and believing that a peaceful\r\nsolution to the religious difficulty was still possible, urged Charles\r\nV. to abstain from decisive action. It was agreed that the work of\r\nexamining and refuting the Augsburg Confession should be entrusted to\r\na certain number of Catholic theologians, the most prominent of whom\r\nwere Eck, Cochlaeus, and Conrad Wimpina.[29] Unfortunately these men\r\nallowed their natural feelings of irritation to overcome their\r\njudgment, and not content with a calm and judicial refutation of the\r\ndocument submitted to them, they attacked warmly the exaggerations,\r\ncontradictions, and misrepresentations of Catholic doctrine of which\r\nLuther had been guilty, and succeeded in imparting to their reply a\r\nbitter and ironical tone more likely to widen than to heal the\r\ndivision. At the request of the Emperor they modified it very\r\nconsiderably, confining themselves entirely to a brief and\r\ndispassionate examination of the individual points raised by\r\nMelanchthon, and in its modified form their refutation (/Confutatio\r\nConfessionis Augustanae/) was presented to the Diet (3rd Aug.).\r\n\r\nWhen the reply of the Catholic theologians had been read the Emperor\r\ncalled upon the Protestant princes to return to the unity of the\r\nChurch; but his appeal fell upon deaf ears, and it seemed as if the\r\nissue were to be decided immediately by civil war. By way of\r\ncompromise it was suggested that representatives of both parties\r\nshould meet in conference, Eck, Cochlaeus, and Wimpina being selected\r\nas the Catholic theologians, Melanchthon, Brenz, and Schnep as the\r\nchampions of Lutheranism. From the very outset it should have been\r\nevident to all that, where disagreement was so fundamental, one party\r\nmaintaining the theory of an infallible Church as the only safe guide\r\nin religious matters, the other rejecting entirely the authority of\r\nthe Church and the Pope in favour of individual judgment, the\r\ndiscussion of particular dogmas could never lead to unity. As a matter\r\nof fact Melanchthon was willing to make most important concessions,\r\nand on the question of original sin, free-will, justification, faith,\r\npenance, and the intercession of the saints, formulas were put forward\r\nnot displeasing to either party. Even in regard to the Eucharist, the\r\njurisdiction of the bishops, and the supremacy of Rome, Melanchthon\r\nwas inclined to go far to meet his opponents, much to the disgust of\r\nthe extremists of his own party and to the no small alarm of\r\nLuther.[30] But in reality the apparent harmony existed only on paper,\r\nand the concessions made by Melanchthon depended entirely on the\r\nmeaning that should be placed on the ambiguous phraseology and\r\nqualifications with which they were clothed. On the question of the\r\nMass, the celibacy of the clergy, and the meritorious character of\r\ngood works, no agreement was arrived at, as Melanchthon, alarmed by\r\nthe opposition of his own supporters and the reproofs of Luther, was\r\nunwilling to modify his position. What the conference of theologians\r\nhad failed to do was undertaken by a mixed commission consisting of\r\nprinces, theologians, and lawyers, but without any result. In\r\nSeptember the Emperor announced that he was endeavouring to procure\r\nthe convocation of a General Council and that in the meantime the\r\nProtestants should return to the old faith, a certain time being\r\nallowed them for consideration, that they should attempt no further\r\ninnovations or interference with the followers of the old faith, that\r\nthey should restore the ecclesiastical goods which had been seized,\r\nand that they should unite with the Catholics in opposing the\r\nAnabaptists and the Sacramentarians.\r\n\r\nThe Protestant princes refused to submit on the ground that their\r\ndoctrines were in harmony with the Word of God, and to justify this\r\ncontention Melanchthon published the /Apologia Confessionis\r\nAugustanae/, which was in many points more full and explicit than the\r\nConfession itself. Some of the German cities that had embraced the\r\nZwinglian doctrine, notably, Strassburg and Constance, repudiated the\r\nAugsburg Confession, and presented a document embodying their beliefs,\r\nknown as the /Confessio Tetrapolitana/ which found no favour with\r\nCharles V. or with the Diet. Finally, on the 18th November, the\r\nEmperor announced to the Diet that until a General Council should\r\nmeet, everything must be restored to the /status quo/, that he felt it\r\nincumbent upon him as protector of the Church to defend the Catholic\r\nfaith with all his might, and that in this work he could count on the\r\nfull support of the Catholic princes. Unfortunately, it was by no\r\nmeans correct to state that the Catholic rulers of Germany stood\r\nbehind their Emperor. Nearly all of them were anxious to avoid civil\r\nwar at any cost, and not a few of them hesitated to support the\r\nEmperor lest the suppression of the Protestant princes might lead to\r\nthe establishment of a strong central power. Nor were the Protestants\r\nalarmed by the threat of force. With the Turks hovering on the flanks\r\nof the empire, they were confident that they might expect concessions\r\nrather than violence.\r\n\r\nThe Protestant princes met in December (1530) at Schmalkald to\r\nconsider their position, and early in the following year (1531) they\r\nformed the Schmalkaldic League for the defence of their religious and\r\ntemporal interests. Negotiations were opened up with France, Denmark,\r\nand England, and notification was made to the Emperor that they must\r\nwithhold their assistance against the Turks until their religious\r\nbeliefs were secured. They refused, furthermore, to recognise\r\nFerdinand, brother of Charles V., whom Charles had proclaimed King of\r\nthe Romans. The Emperor, alarmed by the news that Soliman was\r\npreparing an immense army for a general attack on Italy and Austria,\r\nand well aware that he could not count either on the assistance of the\r\nCatholic princes or the neutrality of France, was forced to give way.\r\nIn July 1532 peace was concluded at Nurnberg. According to the terms\r\nof the Peace of Nurnberg it was agreed that until a General Council\r\nshould assemble no action should be taken against the Protestant\r\nprinces, and that in the interval everything was to remain unchanged.\r\nThis agreement, it was stipulated, should apply only to those who\r\naccepted the Confession of Augsburg, a stipulation that was meant to\r\nexclude the followers of Zwingli.\r\n\r\nCharles V. was really anxious that a Council should be called, nor was\r\nClement VII. unwilling to meet his wishes, if only he could have been\r\ncertain that a Council constituted as such assemblies had been\r\nconstituted traditionally, could serve any useful purpose. Time and\r\nagain Luther had expressed his supreme contempt for the authority of\r\nGeneral Councils, though he professed to be not unwilling to submit\r\nthe matters in dispute to a body of men selected by the civil rulers.\r\nIn 1532-3 Pope and Emperor met at Bologna to discuss the situation,\r\nand messengers were despatched to see on what terms the Protestants\r\nwould consent to attend the Council. The members of the Schmalkaldic\r\nLeague refused (1533) to accept the conditions proposed by the Pope,\r\nnamely, that the Council should be constituted according to the plan\r\nhitherto followed in regard to such assemblies, and that all should\r\npledge themselves beforehand to accept its decrees.[31]\r\n\r\nClement VII. died in September (1534) and was succeeded by Paul III.\r\n(1534-49). He convoked a General Council to meet at Mantua in 1537,\r\nbut the League refused once more to attend (1535). Even had there been\r\nno other difficulties in the way, the war that broke out with renewed\r\nbitterness between Charles V. and Francis I. would have made it\r\nimpossible for such a body to meet with any hope of success. The\r\nhelpless condition of the Emperor, confronted, as he was, on the one\r\nside by the French and on the other by the Turks, raised the hopes of\r\nthe Protestant party, and made them more determined than ever to\r\nattend no Council in which the authority of the bishops or the\r\njurisdiction of the Pope should be recognised. Moreover, each year\r\nbrought new accessions to their ranks. The appearance of organised\r\nChristian bodies, completely national in character, accepting the\r\ncivil rulers as their head, and conceding to them full power to deal\r\nas they liked with ecclesiastical property, created a deep impression\r\non several princes and free cities, and made them not averse to giving\r\nthe new religion a fair trial. In 1530, the Elector of Saxony, Philip\r\nof Hesse and the rulers of Ansbach, Anhalt, Brunswick-Luneburg,\r\nBayreuth, East Friesland, and a few of the larger cities had gone over\r\nto Luther. Before ten years had elapsed the greater part of Northern\r\nGermany had fallen from the Catholic Church, and even in Southern\r\nGermany Protestantism had made serious inroads. Several of the more\r\nimportant cities such as Wittenberg, Strassburg, Nurnberg, Magdeburg,\r\nFrankfurt-on-Main, Hamburg, and Erfurt became leading centres for the\r\nspread of the new teaching, while many of the German universities, for\r\nexample, Erfurt, Basle, Frankfurt, Rostock, and Marburg supported\r\nstrongly the efforts of Luther.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic princes, alarmed by the rapid spread of the new doctrines\r\nand by the extravagant demands of the Protestants, met together to\r\nform the Holy League (1538) as a defence against the Schmalkaldic\r\nconfederation. Feeling was running so high at the time that the long\r\nexpected war might have broken out immediately, had not the dread of a\r\nTurkish invasion exercised a restraining influence on both parties. In\r\n1539 negotiations were opened up for a temporary armistice, and\r\nanother fruitless attempt was made to arrive at peace by means of a\r\nreligious conference. Before any result had been attained the Emperor\r\nsummoned a Diet to meet at Ratisbon (April 1541). Three theologians\r\nwere appointed from both sides to discuss the questions at issue.\r\nThough some of the Catholic representatives showed clearly enough that\r\ntheir desire for union was much greater than their knowledge of\r\nCatholic principles, an understanding was arrived at only in regard to\r\na few points of difference. By the Recess of the Diet (known as the\r\n/Ratisbon Interim/) it was ordered that both parties should observe\r\nthe articles of faith on which they had agreed until a General Council\r\nshould meet, that in the interval the terms of the Peace of Nurnberg\r\nshould be carried out strictly, that the religious houses that had\r\nescaped destruction hitherto should remain undisturbed, and that the\r\ndisciplinary decrees promulgated by the cardinal legate (Contarini)\r\nshould be obeyed by the Catholics.\r\n\r\nThe Protestant princes were still dissatisfied. In order to procure\r\ntheir assistance Charles was obliged to yield to further demands,\r\nnotably, to permit them to suppress the monasteries in their\r\ndominions. But, fortunately for the Catholic Church, the agreement\r\nembodied in the /Ratisbon Interim/ was rejected by the more extreme\r\nProtestant Party led by Luther himself, and the danger of grave\r\nmisunderstanding was removed.\r\n\r\nDuring the following years the Lutheran movement continued to advance\r\nby leaps and bounds. Duke George of Saxony, one of its strongest\r\nopponents, died in 1539, and his successor invited the Lutheran\r\npreachers to assist him in the work of reform. Henry, Duke of\r\nBrunswick, was driven from his kingdom by the League of Schmalkald and\r\nforced to seek refuge in Bavaria. The Bishoprics of Hildesheim and\r\nNaumburg were captured by force, and it required all the efforts of\r\nthe Pope and of the Emperor to prevent Cologne from being handed over\r\nto Luther's followers by its prince-bishop (Hermann von Wied).\r\nLutheranism provided almost irresistible attractions for the lay\r\nrulers, who desired to acquire wealth and power at the expense of the\r\nChurch, as well as for the unworthy ecclesiastical princes who were\r\nanxious to convert the states of which they were merely administrators\r\ninto hereditary dominions.\r\n\r\nBut though outwardly the movement prospered beyond expectation all was\r\nfar from well within. The fundamental principle enunciated by Luther,\r\nnamely, the rejection of all religious authority, opened the way for\r\nnew theories and new sects. Quite apart from the controversies between\r\nthe followers of Luther and Zwingli, which shall be dealt with later,\r\nthe Anabaptists and others continued to destroy the harmony of the\r\nself-styled reformers. The Anabaptists seized the city of Munster,\r\nproclaimed a democratic theocracy with John of Leyden, a tailor, at\r\nits head, and pronounced their intention of taking the field for the\r\noverthrow of tyrants and impostors. But their success was short-lived.\r\nConrad, bishop and prince of Munster, raised an army, laid siege to\r\nthe city which he captured after a desperate struggle, and put to\r\ndeath the fanatical leaders who had deceived the people (1535-6).\r\nOther writers and preachers questioned the doctrines of the Trinity\r\nand Incarnation, and advocated many heresies condemned by the early\r\nChurch, some of them going so far as to insist on the revival of\r\ncircumcision and the Jewish ceremonial law.[32]\r\n\r\nNor did the new teaching exercise an elevating influence on the morals\r\nor conduct of its adherents. Luther himself was forced to admit that\r\nthe condition of affairs had grown worse even than it had been before\r\nhe undertook his campaign. \"Since we have commenced to preach our\r\ndoctrine,\" he said in one of his sermons, \"the world has grown daily\r\nworse, more impious, and more shameless. Men are now beset by legions\r\nof devils, and while enjoying the full light of the Gospel are more\r\navaricious, more impure, and repulsive than of old under the Papacy.\r\nPeasants, burghers, nobles, men of all degrees, the higher as well as\r\nthe lowest are all alike slaves to avarice, drunkenness, gluttony, and\r\nimpurity, and given over to horrible excesses of abominable\r\npassions.\"[33]\r\n\r\nThe princes, free from all religious and ecclesiastical restraints,\r\nset an example of licentiousness which their subjects were not slow to\r\nimitate. Philip of Hesse was the life and soul of the Lutheran\r\nmovement. He was married already to Christina, daughter of Duke George\r\nof Saxony, by whom eight children had been born to him, but finding it\r\nimpossible to observe his marriage obligations, and wishing to impart\r\nto his own sinful conduct an air of decency, he demanded permission\r\nfrom Luther to marry one of the maids of honour in attendance on his\r\nsister. This request placed Luther and Melanchthon in a very delicate\r\nposition. On the one hand, if they acceded to it they would be\r\nregarded as patrons and defenders of adultery and would expose\r\nthemselves to the ridicule of their opponents; on the other, were they\r\nto refuse compliance with his wishes, Philip, forgetful of his former\r\nzeal for the pure word of God, might carry out his threats to return\r\nto the Catholic Church. After long and anxious deliberation they\r\ndetermined to exercise a dispensing power such as had never been\r\nexercised before by any Pope. \"In order to provide for the welfare of\r\nhis soul and body and to bring greater glory to God,\" they allowed him\r\nto take to himself a second wife, insisting, however, that the whole\r\naffair should be kept a close secret. But hardly had the marriage\r\nceremony been gone through (1540) than the story of the dispensation\r\nbecame public. Luther was at first inclined to deny it entirely as an\r\ninvention of his enemies, but he changed his mind when he found that\r\nthe proofs were irrefragable and determined to brazen out the\r\naffair.[34]\r\n\r\nLuther's last years were full of anxiety and sorrow. As he looked\r\nround his own city of Wittenberg and the cities of Germany where his\r\ndoctrines had taken root he found little ground for self-\r\ncongratulation. Religious dissensions, bitterness, war-like\r\npreparations, decline of learning, decay of the universities, and\r\nimmorality, had marked the progress of his gospel. In many districts\r\nthe power of the Pope had indeed been broken, but only to make way for\r\nthe authority of the civil rulers upon whom neither religious nor\r\ndisciplinary canons could exercise any restraint; the monasteries and\r\nreligious institutions had been suppressed, but their wealth had\r\npassed into the treasuries of the princes, whilst the poor for whose\r\nbenefit it had been held in trust were neglected, and the ministers of\r\nreligion were obliged to have recourse to different occupations to\r\nsecure a livelihood. To his followers and his most intimate associates\r\nhe denied the liberty of thought and speech that he claimed for\r\nhimself, by insisting on the unconditional acceptance of his doctrines\r\nas if in him alone were vested supreme authority and infallibility.\r\nFor exercising their right to private judgment, Carlstadt was pursued\r\nfrom pulpit to pulpit till at last he was forced to seek safety in\r\nflight; Zwingli was denounced as a heretic for whose salvation it was\r\nuseless to pray; the Anabaptists were declared to be unworthy of any\r\nbetter fate than the sword or the halter; Agricola, his most zealous\r\nfellow-labourer, was banished from his presence and his writings were\r\ninterdicted; and even Melanchthon was at last driven to complain of\r\nthe state of slavery to which he had been reduced.[35]\r\n\r\nHis failing health and his disappointments served to sour his temper\r\nand to render him less approachable. The attacks that he directed\r\nagainst the Papacy such as /The Papacy an Institution of the Devil/,\r\nand the verses prepared for the vulgar caricatures that he induced\r\nCranach to design (1545) surpassed even his former productions in\r\nviolence and abusiveness. Tired of attacking the Papacy, he turned his\r\nattention once more to the Jews, upon whom he invoked the vengeance of\r\nHeaven in the last sermon that he was destined to preach on earth. He\r\nwas taken suddenly ill in Eisleben, where he had come to settle some\r\ndisputes between the Counts of Mansfeld, and on the 18th February\r\n1546, he passed away.[36]\r\n\r\nLuther is a man whose character it is difficult to appreciate exactly.\r\nAt times he spoke and wrote as if he were endowed with a deeply\r\nreligious feeling, convinced of the truth of his doctrines, and\r\nanxious only for the success of the work for which he professed to\r\nbelieve he had been raised up by God. Some of his sermons sounded like\r\na trumpet call from Heaven, warning the people that the hour for\r\nrepentance had drawn nigh, while his conversations with his intimate\r\nfriends breathed at times a spirit of piety and fervour redolent of\r\nthe apostolic age. This, however, was only one feature of Luther's\r\ncharacter, and, unfortunately, it was a feature that manifested itself\r\nonly too rarely. As a general rule his writings, his sermons and\r\nspeeches, and, in a word, his whole line of conduct were in direct\r\nopposition to everything that is associated generally in the popular\r\nmind with the true religious reformer. His replies to his opponents,\r\neven to those who, avoiding personalities, addressed themselves\r\ndirectly to his doctrines, were couched in the most violent and\r\nabusive language. His wild onslaughts and his demands for vengeance on\r\nany one who ventured to question his teaching, whether they were\r\nCatholics, Zwinglians, Sacramentarians or Anabaptists, were the very\r\nantithesis of the spirit of charity and meekness that should\r\ncharacterise a follower, not to say an apostle, of Christ. Nor were\r\nhis over-weening pride and self-confidence in keeping with the spirit\r\nof meekness and humility inculcated so frequently in the writings of\r\nthe New Testament.\r\n\r\nIn his letters, and more especially in his familiar intercourse with\r\nhis friends,[37] his conversation was frequently risky and indecent;\r\nhis relations with women, at least before his marriage with Catherine\r\nBora, were, to put it mildly, not above suspicion, as is evident from\r\nhis own letters and the letters of his most devoted supporters; while\r\nhis references to marriage and vows of chastity in his sermons and\r\npamphlets were filthy and unpardonable even in an age when people were\r\nmuch more outspoken on such subjects than they are at present. Though\r\nhe insisted strongly on the necessity of preaching the pure Word of\r\nGod, he had little difficulty in having recourse to falsehood when\r\ntruth did not serve his purpose, or in justifying his conduct by\r\nadvocating the principle that not all lies were sinful particularly if\r\nthey helped to damage the Roman Church. His frequent and enthusiastic\r\nreferences to the pleasures of the table were more like what one\r\nshould expect to find in the writings of a Pagan epicure than in those\r\nof a Christian reformer. He was not, as is sometimes asserted, a\r\nhabitual drunkard. His tireless activity as a writer and preacher is\r\nin itself a sufficient refutation of such a charge, but he was\r\nconvinced that a hard drinking bout was at times good for both soul\r\nand body, and in this respect at least he certainly lived up to his\r\nconvictions.[38]\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake to judge him by his Latin writings, which, both\r\nin manner and style, seldom rise above the level of mediocrity. It is\r\nin his German books and pamphlets that Luther is seen at his best.\r\nThere, he appears as a man of great ability and learning, gifted with\r\na prodigious memory, a striking literary style, and a happy knack of\r\nseizing upon the weak points of his adversaries and of presenting his\r\nown side of the case in its most forcible and attractive form. No man\r\nknew better than he how to adapt himself to the tastes of his audience\r\nor the prejudices of his readers. He could play the role of the judge\r\nor the professor almost as well as that of the impassioned fanatic\r\nconvinced that behind him were arrayed all the powers of Heaven. In\r\ndealing with men of education, who were not likely to be captivated by\r\nrhetoric, he could be calm and argumentative; but when he addressed\r\nhimself to the masses of the people he appeared in his true character\r\nas a popular demagogue, hesitating at nothing that was likely to\r\narouse their indignation against the Roman Church and their enthusiasm\r\nfor the movement to which he had devoted his life. In words of fiery\r\neloquence he recalled to their minds the real and imaginary grievances\r\nof their nation against Rome, the over-weening pride and tyranny of\r\nthe spiritual princes, the scandalous lives of many of the\r\necclesiastics, and the failure of the Pope and councils to carry\r\nthrough a scheme of wholesale reform. He called upon them to throw off\r\nthe yoke imposed by foreigners on their fathers and themselves, and to\r\nsupport him in his struggle for the liberty of the people, the\r\nindependence of the German nation, and the original purity of the\r\nGospel, promising them that if only they would range themselves under\r\nhis banner, all their grievances, both spiritual and temporal, must\r\nsoon be redressed. Had Luther never appeared, or had he been less\r\ngifted as an orator, a writer and a popular leader than he was, a\r\ncrisis must have arisen at the time; but his genius and enthusiasm\r\nturned what might have been a trickling stream into a raging torrent,\r\nthreatening destruction to beliefs and institutions hitherto regarded\r\nas inviolable. The time was ripe for a reformer, and Luther's only\r\nclaim to greatness was his capacity of utilising in a masterly way the\r\nmaterials, political and religious, that lay ready at his hand.\r\nReligious abuses, social unrest, politics, personal vanities, and the\r\nexcesses always attendant upon a great literary revival, were pressed\r\ninto his service, and were directed against the Roman Church. And yet\r\nhis success fell far short of his expectations. Beyond doubt he\r\ncontrived to detach individuals and kingdoms from their obedience to\r\nthe Pope and their submission to ecclesiastical authority only to\r\nsubject them to the spiritual yoke of secular princes, and to expose\r\nthem to doctrinal anarchy subversive of dogmatic religion; but the\r\nCatholic Church and the See of Rome, for the overthrow of which he had\r\nlaboured so energetically, emerged triumphant from the terrible trial\r\nthat had been permitted by God only for its purification.\r\n\r\nDuring the period that intervened between the /Ratisbon Interim/ and\r\nthe death of Luther (1541-6) Charles V., hard pressed by the war with\r\nFrance and the unsuccessful expeditions against the Barbary pirates,\r\nwas obliged to yield to the increasing demands of the Protestant\r\nprinces; nor could Paul III., however much he desired it, realise his\r\nintention of convoking a General Council. But at last the Peace of\r\nCrepy (1544) which put an end to the war with France, and the\r\nconvocation of a General Council to meet at Trent in March 1545,\r\nstrengthened the hands of the Emperor, and enabled him to deal\r\neffectively with the religious revolution. The Protestant princes\r\nannounced their determination to take no part in a Council convoked\r\nand presided over by the Pope. Charles left no stone unturned to\r\ninduce them to adopt a more conciliatory attitude, but all his efforts\r\nhaving proved unavailing, he let it be known publicly that he would\r\nnot allow himself to be intimidated by threats of violence, and that\r\nif need be he would insist on obedience at the point of the sword.\r\nJohn Frederick of Saxony and Philip of Hesse, alarmed by the\r\nthreatening aspect of affairs, determined to anticipate the Emperor,\r\nand took the field at the head of an army of forty thousand men\r\n(1546).\r\n\r\nCharles V., relying upon the aid of the Pope and the co-operation of\r\nthe Catholic princes, issued a proclamation calling upon all loyal\r\nsubjects to treat them as rebels and outlaws. Maurice of Saxony\r\ndeserted his co-religionists on promise of succeeding to the\r\nElectorship, joined the standard of Charles V., and in conjunction\r\nwith Ferdinand directed his forces against Saxony. The Elector was\r\ndefeated and captured at Muhlberg (April 1547). He was condemned to\r\ndeath as a traitor, but he was reprieved and detained as a prisoner in\r\nthe suite of the Emperor, while his nephew, Maurice of Saxony,\r\nsucceeded to his dominions. Philip of Hesse, too, was obliged to\r\nsurrender, and Charles V. found himself everywhere victorious. He\r\ninsisted on the restoration of the Bishop of Naumburg and of Henry of\r\nBrunswick to his kingdom as well as on the resignation of Hermann\r\nPrince von Wied, Archbishop of Cologne. He was unwilling, however, to\r\nproceed to extremes with the Protestant princes, well knowing that he\r\ncould not rely on some of his own supporters. Besides, he had become\r\ninvolved in serious difficulties with Pope Paul III., who complained,\r\nand not without reason, of the demands made upon him by the Emperor,\r\nand of the concessions that the Emperor was willing to make to the\r\nLutherans.\r\n\r\nCharles V. summoned a Diet to meet at Augsburg (1547), where he hoped\r\nthat a permanent understanding might be secured. A document known as\r\nthe /Augsburg Interim/, prepared by Catholic theologians in\r\nconjunction with the Lutheran, John Agricola, was accepted\r\nprovisionally by both parties. The doctrines were expressed in a very\r\nmild form, though not, however, altogether unacceptable to Catholics.\r\nProtestants were permitted to receive communion under both kinds;\r\ntheir married clergy were allowed to retain their wives; and it was\r\nunderstood tacitly that they might keep possession of the\r\necclesiastical property they had seized. The /Augsburg Interim/, as\r\nmight have been anticipated, was displeasing to both parties. Maurice\r\nof Saxony, unwilling to give it unconditional approval, consulted\r\nMelanchthon and others of his school as to how far he might accept its\r\nterms. In their reply they distinguished between matters that were\r\nessential and those that were only of secondary importance. The latter\r\nmight be accepted unreservedly in obedience to the orders of the\r\nEmperor. In regard to doctrines, they were willing to compromise on\r\nthe question of justification and good-works, to accept the\r\nsacraments, including confirmation and Extreme Unction, the Mass with\r\nthe addition of some German hymns, and in a certain sense the\r\njurisdiction of the bishops. Such concessions were a distinct\r\ndeparture from Luther's teaching and would have been impossible had he\r\nbeen alive.\r\n\r\nThe relations between the Pope and the Emperor took a more friendly\r\nturn when the General Council was transferred from Bologna to Trent\r\n(1551). The Protestant princes, invited to send representatives,\r\ndeclined at first, but in a short time several of them agreed to\r\naccept the invitation. Safe conducts were issued for their\r\nrepresentatives by the Council in 1551 and again in 1552. Even the\r\nWittenberg theologians were not unfavourably disposed, and Melanchthon\r\nwas actually on his way to Trent. But suddenly Maurice of Saxony, who\r\nhad assembled a large army under pretext of reducing Magdeburg, and\r\nhad strengthened himself by an alliance with several princes as well\r\nas by a secret treaty with Henry II. of France, deserted the Emperor\r\nand placed himself at the head of the Protestant forces. When all his\r\nplans were completed he advanced suddenly through Thuringia, took\r\nAugsburg, and was within an inch of capturing the Emperor who then lay\r\nill at Innsbruck (1552). At the same time the French forces occupied\r\nLorraine. Charles, finding himself unable to carry on the struggle,\r\nopened negotiations for peace, and in 1552 the Treaty of Passau was\r\nconcluded. Philip of Hesse was to be set at liberty; a Diet was to be\r\ncalled within six months to settle the religious differences; in the\r\nmeantime neither the Emperor nor the princes should interfere with\r\nfreedom of conscience; and all disputes that might arise were to be\r\nreferred to a commission consisting of an equal number of Protestant\r\nand Catholic members.\r\n\r\nOwing to the war with France it was not until the year 1555 that the\r\nproposed Diet met at Augsburg. The Protestant party, encouraged by\r\ntheir victories, were in no humour for compromise, and as it was\r\nevident that there was no longer any hope of healing the religious\r\ndivision in the Empire, it was agreed that peace could be secured only\r\nby mutual toleration. In September 1555 the Peace of Augsburg was\r\nconcluded. According to the terms of this convention full freedom of\r\nconscience was conceded in the Empire to Catholics and to all\r\nProtestants who accepted the Augsburg Confession. The latter were\r\npermitted to retain the ecclesiastical goods which they had already\r\nacquired before the Treaty of Passau (1552). For the future each\r\nprince was to be free to determine the religion of his subjects, but\r\nin case a subject was not content with the religion imposed on him by\r\nhis sovereign he could claim the right to migrate into a more friendly\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nA great difficulty arose in regard to the disposal of the\r\necclesiastical property in case a Catholic bishop or abbot should\r\napostatise. Notwithstanding the protests of the Protestant party, it\r\nwas decreed that if such an event should occur the seceder could claim\r\nhis own personal property, but not the property attached to his\r\noffice. This clause, known as the /Ecclesiasticum Reservatum/, gave\r\nrise to many disputes, and was one of the principal causes of the\r\nThirty Years' War.\r\n\r\nBy the /Peace of Augsburg/ Protestantism was recognised as a distinct\r\nand separate form of Christianity, and the first blow was struck at\r\nthe fundamental principles on which the Holy Roman Empire had been\r\nbuilt. Charles V. was blamed at the time, and has been blamed since\r\nfor having given his consent to such a treaty, but if all the\r\ncircumstances of the time be duly considered it is difficult to see\r\nhow he could have acted otherwise than he did. It is not the Emperor\r\nwho should be held accountable for the unfavourable character of the\r\nAugsburg Peace, but \"the most Catholic King of France\" who allied\r\nhimself with the forces of German Protestantism, and the Catholic\r\nprinces who were more anxious to secure their own position than to\r\nfight for their sovereign or their religion. Charles V., broken down\r\nin health and wearied by his misfortunes and his failure to put down\r\nthe religious revolt, determined to hand over to a younger man the\r\nadministration of the territories over which he ruled, and to devote\r\nthe remainder of his life to preparation for the world to come. In a\r\nparting address delivered to the States of the Netherlands he warned\r\nthem \"to be loyal to the Catholic faith which has always been and\r\neverywhere the faith of Christendom, for should it disappear the\r\nfoundations of goodness should crumble away and every sort of mischief\r\nnow menacing the world would reign supreme.\" After his resignation he\r\nretired to a monastery in Estremadura, where he died in 1558. Spain\r\nand the Netherlands passed to his legitimate son, Philip II., while\r\nafter some delay his brother, Ferdinand, was recognised as his\r\nsuccessor in the Empire.\r\n\r\nCharles V. was a man of sound judgment and liberal views, of great\r\nenergy and prudence, as skilful in war as he was in the arts of\r\ndiplomacy, and immensely superior in nearly every respect to his\r\ncontemporaries, Francis I. of France and Henry VIII. of England. Yet\r\nin spite of all his admitted qualifications, and notwithstanding the\r\nfact that he was the ruler of three-fourths of Western Europe, he\r\nlived to witness the overthrow of his dearest projects and the\r\ncomplete failure of his general policy. But his want of success was\r\nnot due to personal imprudence or inactivity. It is to be attributed\r\nto the circumstances of the times, the rebellion in Spain, the open\r\nrevolt of some and the distrust of others in Germany, the rapid\r\nadvance of the Turks towards the west, and, above all, the struggle\r\nwith France. Despite his many quarrels with the Holy See, and in face\r\nof the many temptations held out to him to arrive at the worldwide\r\ndictatorship to which he was suspected of aspiring, by putting himself\r\nat the head of the new religious movement, he never wavered for a\r\nmoment in his allegiance to the Catholic Church.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] Grisar, /Luther/ (Eng.

In 1291, however, during the reign of Rudolph of\r\nHabsburg, the three states or cantons of Uri, Schweiz, and\r\nUnterwalden, formed a confederation to defend their rights and\r\nprivileges, thus laying the foundation for the existence of\r\nSwitzerland as an independent nation. Other cantons joined the\r\nalliance, more especially after the victory at Morgarten in 1315, when\r\nthe Austrian forces despatched against the Swiss were almost\r\nannihilated. Austria made various attempts to win back the Swiss to\r\ntheir allegiance but without success, and in 1394 the independence of\r\nthe allied cantons was practically recognised.\r\n\r\nAbout the time of the Reformation in Germany Switzerland consisted of\r\nthirteen cantons and several smaller \"allied\" or \"friendly\" states not\r\nadmitted to full cantonal rights. Though bound together by a loose\r\nkind of confederation for purposes of defence against aggression, the\r\nvarious states enjoyed a large measure of independence, and each was\r\nruled according to its own peculiar constitution. The Federal Diet or\r\nGeneral Assembly was composed of representatives appointed by the\r\ncantons, and its decisions were determined by the votes of the states,\r\nthe largest and most populous possessing no greater powers than the\r\nleast influential member of the confederation. Some of the states were\r\nnominally democratic in their form of government, but, as in most\r\ncountries during this period, the peasants had many grounds for\r\nreasonable complaint, particularly in regard to taxation, treasury\r\npensions, and the enlisting and employment of the Swiss mercenary\r\ntroops, then the best soldiers in Europe.\r\n\r\nAs in Germany, many causes were at work to prepare the ground for the\r\nnew religious teaching. On account of the free character of its\r\ninstitutions refugees of all kinds fled to Switzerland for asylum, and\r\nwere allowed great liberty in propagating their views. Again, the\r\nSwiss mercenaries, returning from their campaigns and service, during\r\nwhich they were brought into contact with various classes and nations,\r\nserved much the same purpose as does the modern newspaper. In both\r\nthese ways the peasants of Switzerland were kept in touch with the\r\nsocial, political, and religious condition of the rest of Europe, and\r\nwith the hopes and plans of their own class in other kingdoms.\r\nHumanism had not, indeed, made very striking progress in Switzerland,\r\nthough the presence of Erasmus at Basle, and the attacks that he\r\ndirected against the monks and the clergy, could not fail to produce\r\nsome effect on a people whose minds were already prepared for such\r\nmethods by their acquaintance with modern developments.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the Church in Switzerland had been free from abuses not\r\nall the wit and eloquence of Erasmus and his followers could have\r\nproduced a revolt, but unfortunately, the influences that led to the\r\ndownfall of religion in other countries were also at work in the Swiss\r\ncantons. The cathedral chapters were composed for the greater part of\r\nmen who had no vocation to the priesthood, and who adopted the\r\nclerical profession because they wished to enrich themselves from the\r\nrevenues of the Church, and were ensured of good positions through the\r\ninfluence of their relatives and patrons. Many of the clergy were far\r\nfrom being perfect, nor were all the religious institutions mindful of\r\nthe spirit or even of the letter of their constitutions.\r\nUnfortunately, too, owing to the peculiar political development of\r\ntheir country, the bishops of Switzerland were subject to foreign\r\nmetropolitans, two of them being under the jurisdiction of the\r\nArchbishop of Mainz, two under Besancon, one under Aquileia, and one\r\nsubject immediately to Rome. Partly for this reason, partly, also,\r\nowing to the increasing encroachments of the civil power, disputes and\r\nconflicts between the ecclesiastical and temporal jurisdictions were\r\nnot unfrequent. But it would be a mistake to suppose that there were\r\nno good ecclesiastics in Switzerland at this time. There were many\r\nexcellent priests, both secular and regular, who recognised the sad\r\ncondition of affairs, and who supported measures such as those\r\nundertaken by the Bishop of Basle in 1503 with all their power. The\r\ngreat body of teachers known as the Friends of God were at work in\r\nSwitzerland as in the Netherlands, and were doing splendid service for\r\neducation, both secular and religious.\r\n\r\nThe man, who played in Switzerland the part played so successfully by\r\nLuther in Germany, was Ulrich Zwingli. He was the son of rich parents,\r\nborn at Wildhaus, in the canton of Saint Gall (1484), educated at the\r\nUniversities of Berne, Basle, and Vienna, and after his ordination to\r\nthe priesthood, appointed to the parish of Glarus. He was a young man\r\nof remarkable ability both as a student and as a preacher, and was\r\nfortunate enough to attract the notice of a papal legate, through\r\nwhose influence a pension was assigned to him to enable him to\r\nprosecute his studies. He was a good classical scholar with a more\r\nthan average knowledge of Hebrew, and well versed in the Scriptures\r\nand in the writings of the Fathers. For a time he acted as chaplain to\r\nsome Swiss regiments fighting in Italy for the Pope against France,\r\nand on his return to his native country he was appointed preacher at\r\nthe famous shrine of Our Lady at Einsiedeln.[1] Here his oratorical\r\npowers stood him in good stead, but his judgment and level-headedness\r\nwere not on the same high plane as his declamatory powers, nor was his\r\nown private life in keeping with the sanctity of the place or with the\r\ndenunciations that he hurled so recklessly against his clerical\r\nbrethren. He began to attack pilgrimages and devotions to the Blessed\r\nVirgin, but it was not so much for this as for his unlawful relations\r\nwith a woman of bad character that he was relieved of his office.[2]\r\nHe retired to Zurich where he was appointed preacher in the cathedral.\r\nHere he denounced the lives of the clergy and the abuses in the\r\nChurch, relying, as he stated, upon what he had seen himself in Italy\r\nduring his residence there as chaplain to the Swiss mercenaries. Like\r\nLuther, he well knew how to win the attention and sympathy of the mob\r\nby his appeals to the national feelings of his countrymen, and like\r\nLuther he insisted that the Scriptures were the sole rule of faith. He\r\ndenounced in the strongest language the immorality and vices of the\r\nclergy, celibacy, vows of chastity, pilgrimages and the veneration of\r\nthe saints, but for so far he had not broken entirely with the Church.\r\n\r\nThe preaching of the Indulgences promulgated by Leo X. in Constance\r\nwas entrusted to the Franciscans. Their work was a difficult one\r\nespecially as the Grand Council of Zurich forbade them to persist, as,\r\nindeed, did also the able and zealous Hugo von Hohenlandenberg, Bishop\r\nof Constance, in whose diocese Zurich was situated. Zwingli, confident\r\nof the support of the city authorities, attacked the doctrine of\r\nIndulgences and was backed by the Grand Council, which ordered, at his\r\ninstigation, that the Word of God should be preached according to the\r\nScriptures, regardless of tradition or the interpretation of the\r\nChurch. Later on he directed his attacks against the meritoriousness\r\nof good works and the practice of fast and abstinence (1522), and\r\nabout the same time he addressed a petition to the Bishop of Constance\r\ndemanding that he should not interfere with the preaching of the pure\r\nWord of God nor set any obstacle to the marriage of his priests. He\r\nadmitted publicly that his relations with women had been disgraceful,\r\nthat he had learned from his own personal experience how impossible of\r\nfulfilment was the vow of chastity, and that marriage was the only\r\nremedy that would enable him to overcome the emotions of carnal lust\r\nreferred to by St. Paul in his epistle to the Corinthians (I. 7, 9).\r\nThe bishop refused to yield to this demand insisting on the strict\r\nobservance of celibacy, and appealed to the Grand Council to support\r\nhim with the full weight of their authority (April 1522).\r\n\r\nIncensed by this refusal Zwingli shook off the yoke of ecclesiastical\r\nauthority, rejected the primacy of the Pope, and the infallibility of\r\nGeneral Councils, denounced celibacy and vows of chastity as\r\ninventions of the devil, and called upon the Swiss people to support\r\nhim in his fight for religious freedom. Once before, in 1520, Leo X.\r\nhad summoned Zwingli to Rome to answer for his teaching, but the\r\nsummons had been unheeded. Adrian VI. made another attempt to win him\r\nfrom his dangerous course by a letter full of kindness and sympathy,\r\nbut his remonstrance produced no effect (1523). The Grand Council of\r\nZurich, hopeful of securing a preponderating influence in Switzerland\r\nby taking the lead in the new movement, favoured Zwingli. Instead of\r\nresponding to the appeal of the Bishop of Constance it announced a\r\ngreat religious disputation to be held in January 1523, to which both\r\nZwingli and his opponents were summoned for the explanation and\r\ndefence of their views. Zwingli put forward sixty-seven theses, the\r\nprincipal of which were that the Bible is the sole rule of faith, that\r\nthe Church is not a visible society but only an assembly of the elect,\r\nof which body Christ is the only true head, that consequently the\r\njurisdiction of the Pope and of the bishops is a usurpation devoid of\r\nscriptural authority, that the Mass, Confession, Purgatory, and\r\nIntercession of the Saints are to be rejected as derogatory to the\r\nmerits of Christ, and finally, that clerical celibacy and monastic\r\nvows, instead of being counsels of perfection, are only cloaks for sin\r\nand hypocrisy. The Bishop of Constance refused to take part in such a\r\ndisputation. His vicar-general, Johann Faber of Constance, however,\r\nattended the meeting, not indeed to take part in the discussion but\r\nmerely to protest against it as opposed to the authority of the Church\r\nand of the councils. As his protests were unheeded, he undertook to\r\ndefend the doctrines attacked, but in the end the Grand Council\r\ndeclared that the victory rested with Zwingli.\r\n\r\nFlushed with his triumph Zwingli now proceeded to put his theories\r\ninto practice. Supported by a mob he endeavoured to prevent the\r\ncelebration of Mass, religious processions, the use of pictures and\r\nstatues, and the solemn ceremonial associated with Extreme Unction and\r\nthe Viaticum. He compiled an introduction to the New Testament for the\r\nuse of the clergy, called upon them to abandon their obligations of\r\ncelibacy, and set them an example by taking as his wife a woman who\r\nhad been for years his concubine. He and his followers, supported by\r\nthe majority of the Grand Council, went through the city destroying\r\naltars, pictures, statues, organs, and confessionals, and erecting in\r\nplace of the altars plain tables with a plate for bread and a vessel\r\nfor wine. The Catholic members of the Grand Council were driven from\r\ntheir position, and Catholic worship forbidden in Zurich (1523-5).\r\n\r\nThe system of Zwingli was much more rationalistic and, in a certain\r\nsense, much more logical than that of Luther. Imbued with the\r\nprinciples of pantheistic mysticism, he maintained that God is in\r\nHimself all being, created as well as uncreated, and all activity.\r\nHence it was as absurd to speak of individual liberty or individual\r\naction as to speak of a multiplicity of gods. Whether it was a case of\r\ndoing good or doing evil man was but a machine like a brush in the\r\nhands of a painter. In regard to sin he contended man may be punished\r\nfor violating the law laid down by God even though the violation is\r\nunavoidable, but God, being above all law, is nowise to blame.\r\nConcupiscence or self-love is, according to him, at the root of all\r\nmisdeeds. It is in itself the real original sin, and is not blotted\r\nout by Baptism. His teaching on the Scriptures, individual judgment,\r\necclesiastical authority as represented by the bishops, councils, and\r\nPope, good works, indulgences, purgatory, invocation of the saints,\r\nand vows of chastity differed but slightly from what Luther had put\r\nforward. On the question of Justification, and particularly on the\r\ndoctrine of the Eucharist, the two reformers found themselves in\r\nhopeless conflict.[3]\r\n\r\nZwingli's teaching did not at first find much favour in other portions\r\nof German Switzerland. Lucerne declared against it in 1524. The city\r\nauthorities forbade the introduction of the new teaching, and offered\r\nan asylum to those Catholics who had been forced to flee from Zurich.\r\nOther cantons associated themselves with Lucerne, and a deputation was\r\nsent to Zurich to request the city authorities to abandon Zwingli and\r\nto take part in a general movement for a real and constitutional\r\nreform. But the Grand Council, mindful of the political advantages\r\nwhich would accrue to Zurich from its leadership in the new religious\r\nrevolt, declined to recede from their position.\r\n\r\nWhile Zwingli was at work in Zurich, Oecolampadius (1482-1531) set\r\nhimself to stir up religious divisions in Basle. He was born at\r\nWeisnberg, studied law at Bologna and theology subsequently at\r\nHeidelberg, was ordained priest, and appointed to a parish in Basle\r\n(1512). With Erasmus he was on terms of the closest intimacy, and, as\r\nBasle was then one of the great literary centres of the world, he soon\r\nbecame acquainted with Luther's pamphlets and teaching. Some of the\r\nclergy in Basle, notably Wolfgang Capito, a warm friend of Zwingli,\r\nwere already showing signs of restlessness especially in regard to the\r\nMass, purgatory, and invocation of the saints, and Oecolampadius was\r\nnot slow to imbibe the new ideas. In 1518 he was appointed preacher in\r\nthe Cathedral of Augsburg, but, having resigned this office on account\r\nof failing health, he withdrew to the convent of Altmunster, where,\r\nfor some time, he lived a retired life. Subsequently he acted as\r\nchaplain to the well-known German knight, Franz von Sickingen, and\r\nfinally, in 1524, he accepted the parish of St. Martin's in Basle.\r\n\r\nHe now proclaimed himself openly a supporter of Zwingli, advocated the\r\nnew teaching on justification and good works, and attacked several\r\nCatholic doctrines and practices. For him, as indeed for most of the\r\nother reformers, clerical celibacy was the great stumbling block. He\r\nencouraged his followers by taking as his wife a young widow, who was\r\nsubsequently in turn the wife of the two renowned Lutheran preachers,\r\nButzer and Capito. At first the city authorities and a large body of\r\nthe university professors were against him, but owing to the\r\ndisturbances created by his partisans full liberty of worship was\r\ngranted to the new sect (1527). Not content with this concession, they\r\ndemanded that the Mass should be suppressed. In 1529 the followers of\r\nOecolampadius rose in revolt, seized the arsenal of the city, directed\r\nthe cannon on the principal squares, and attacked the churches,\r\ndestroying altars, statues, and pictures. Erasmus, disgusted with such\r\nmethods of propagating religion, left Basle and sought a home in\r\nFreiburg. The Catholics were expelled from the city council, their\r\nreligion was proscribed, and Basle joined hands with Zurich in its\r\nrebellion against the Church.\r\n\r\nThe revolt soon spread into other cantons of Switzerland. In Berne and\r\nSchaffhausen both parties were strong and determined, and for a time\r\nthe issue of the conflict was uncertain, but in 1528 the party of\r\nZwingli and Oecolampadius secured the upper hand. Similarly in St.\r\nGall, Glarus, etc., victory rested with the new teaching. Other\r\ncantons, as for example, Solothurn, wavered as to which side they\r\nshould take, but the three oldest cantons of Switzerland, Uri, Schweiz\r\nand Unterwalden, together with Zug, Freiburg and Lucerne, refused to\r\nbe separated from the Church.\r\n\r\nApart altogether from the question of religion, there was a natural\r\nopposition between populous and manufacturing centres like Berne and\r\nBasle, and the rural cantons, devoted almost entirely to agricultural\r\nand pastoral pursuits. When religious differences supervened to\r\naccentuate the rivalry already in existence, they led almost\r\ninevitably to the division of Switzerland into two hostile camps.\r\nZurich, Basle, Berne, Schaffhausen, and St. Gall, though they were the\r\nmost important cities, soon found themselves unable to force their\r\nviews on the rest of the country, as they were withstood by the\r\nfederal council, the majority of which was still Catholic. The latter\r\ninsisted that a conference should be held to settle the religious\r\ndisputes. The conference was arranged to take place at Baden in 1526.\r\nEck, assisted by two other Catholic theologians, Faber and Murner,\r\nundertook to defend the Catholic position. Zurich refused to send\r\nrepresentatives, but the reforming party were represented by\r\nOecolampadius, Haller, and others of their leaders. The conference was\r\nattended by delegates from twelve cantons, and was approved of by the\r\nSwiss bishops. After a discussion lasting fifteen days during which\r\nEck defended the Catholic doctrine regarding the Mass, Eucharist,\r\nPurgatory, and the Intercession of the Saints, the majority of the\r\ncantons decided in his favour, and a resolution was passed forbidding\r\nreligious changes in Switzerland and prohibiting the sale of the works\r\nof Luther and Zwingli.\r\n\r\nIt was soon evident, however, that peace could not be secured by such\r\nmeasures. The rural and Catholic cantons were in the majority, much to\r\nthe disgust of flourishing cities like Berne and Zurich. These states,\r\nbelieving that they were entitled to a controlling voice in the\r\nfederal council, determined to use the religious question to bring\r\nabout a complete change in the constitution of the country by\r\nassigning the cantonal representation in the federal council on the\r\nbasis of population. They formed an alliance with the other Protestant\r\ncantons and with Constance to forward their claims (1527-8), but the\r\nCatholic cantons imitated their example by organising a Catholic\r\nfederation to which the Archduke, Ferdinand of Austria, promised his\r\nsupport (1529).\r\n\r\nZwingli was most eager for war, and at his instigation the army of\r\nZurich, backed by Berne, took the field in 1529. The Catholic states,\r\nhowever, made it clear that they were both able and willing to defend\r\nthe constitution, but the bond of national unity and the dislike of\r\ncivil war exercised such an influence on both parties that a conflict\r\nwas averted by the conclusion of the Peace of Kappel (1529). The\r\nconcessions secured for his party by this Peace did not satisfy\r\nZwingli, who desired nothing less than the complete subjugation of the\r\nCatholic cantons. Negotiations were opened up with Philip of Hesse,\r\nwith the German Lutherans, and with Francis I. of France, and when the\r\nnews of the formation of the League of Schmalkald reached the\r\nProtestants of Switzerland, it was thought that the time had come when\r\nthe triumph of Zurich and Berne, which meant also the triumph of the\r\nnew teaching, should be secured. Zwingli besought his followers to\r\nissue a declaration of war, but it was suggested that the reduction of\r\nthe Catholic cantons could be secured just as effectively by a\r\nblockade. In this movement Zurich took the lead. The result, however,\r\ndid not coincide with the anticipations of Zwingli. The Catholic\r\ncantons flew to arms at once, and as their territories formed a\r\ncompact unit, they were able to put their united army into the field\r\nbefore the forces of Zurich and Berne could effect a junction. The\r\ndecisive battle took place at Kappel in October 1531, when the\r\nZwinglians suffered a complete defeat, Zwingli himself and five\r\nhundred of the best men of Zurich being left dead on the field. The\r\narmy of Berne advanced too late to save their allies or to change the\r\nresult of the war. The Catholic cantons used their victory with great\r\nmoderation. Instead of crushing their opponents, as they might have\r\ndone, they concluded with them the second Peace of Kappel (1531).\r\nAccording to the terms of this treaty, no canton was to force another\r\nto change its religion, and liberty of worship was guaranteed in the\r\ncantonal domains. Several of the districts that had been wavering\r\nreturned to the Catholic faith, and the abbot of St. Gall was restored\r\nto the abbey from which he had been expelled.\r\n\r\nOecolampadius followed Zwingli to the grave in a short time, having\r\nbeen carried off by a fever about a month after the defeat of Kappel,\r\nand the leadership of the movement devolved upon their successors,\r\nBullinger and Myconius.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Sacraments Luther and Zwingli agreed that they were\r\nonly signs of grace, though in the explanation of this view Zwingli\r\nwas much more extreme, because much more logical, than Luther.\r\nBelieving as he did that justification depended upon faith alone, he\r\ncontended that the Sacraments were mere ceremonies by which a man\r\nbecame or showed himself to be a follower of Christ. They were devoid\r\nof any objective virtue, and were efficacious only in so far as they\r\nguaranteed that the individual receiving them possessed the faith\r\nnecessary for justification. But it was principally in regard to the\r\nEucharist that the two reformers found themselves in hopeless\r\ndisagreement. Had Luther wished to be consistent he should have thrown\r\nover the Real Presence as well as Transubstantiation, but the force of\r\ntradition, the fear that any such teaching would arouse the opposition\r\nof the people, and the plain meaning of the texts of Scripture forced\r\nhim to adopt a compromise. \"Had Doctor Carlstadt,\" he wrote, \"or any\r\none else been able to persuade me five years ago that the sacrament of\r\nthe altar is but bread and wine he would, indeed, have done me a great\r\nservice, and rendered me very material aid in my efforts to make a\r\nbreach in the Papacy. But it is all in vain. The meaning of the texts\r\nis so evident that every artifice of language will be powerless to\r\nexplain it away.\" He contended that the words \"This is My body and\r\nThis is My blood\" could bear only one meaning, namely, that Christ was\r\nreally present, but while agreeing with Catholics about the Real\r\nPresence of Christ in the Eucharist, he rejected the doctrine of\r\nTransubstantiation, maintaining in its place Consubstantiation or\r\nImpanation.\r\n\r\nThough Luther insisted so strongly on the Real Presence, it is not\r\nclear that in the beginning he had any very fixed views on the\r\nsubject, or that he would have been unwilling to change any views he\r\nhad formed, were it not that one of his lieutenants, Carlstadt, began\r\nto exercise his privilege of judgment by rejecting the Real Presence.\r\nSuch an act of insubordination aroused the implacable ire of Luther,\r\nwho denounced his former colleague as a heretic, and pursued him from\r\nWittenberg and Jena, where he had fled for refuge. In the end\r\nCarlstadt was obliged to retire to Switzerland, where his doctrine\r\nfound favour with the Swiss reformers.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of his campaign Zwingli realised that the Real\r\nPresence was not in harmony with his theory of justification, and\r\nhence he was inclined to hold that the Eucharist was a mere sign\r\ninstituted as a reminder of Christ's death. But in view of the clear\r\ntestimony of the Holy Scripture he was at a loss how to justify his\r\nposition. At last by pondering on other passages that he considered\r\nsimilar to the text \"This is My body,\" where the word \"is\" should be\r\ninterpreted \"signifies,\" he contended that the true meaning of\r\nChrist's words at the Last Supper is, \"This signifies My body.\"\r\nOecolampadius agreed with this interpretation, though for a different\r\nreason, comparing the Blessed Eucharist to a ring that a husband going\r\naway on a long journey might give to his wife as a pledge and reminder\r\nof his affection.[4]\r\n\r\nLuther resented bitterly such a theory as an attack upon his\r\nauthority, especially as Zwingli refused to allow himself to be brow-\r\nbeaten into retracting his doctrine. Instead of submitting to the new\r\nreligious dictator, Zwingli sought to justify himself by the very\r\nprinciple by which Luther justified his own revolt against the\r\nCatholic Church. He contended that Luther's theory of justification\r\ninvolved logically the rejection of the Eucharist as well as of the\r\nother Sacraments, that the Scriptural texts could be interpreted as he\r\nhad interpreted them, and that he was not bound to take any cognisance\r\nof the Christian tradition or of the authority of the councils. He\r\ncomplained that Luther treated himself and his followers as heretics\r\nwith whom it was not right to hold communion, that he proscribed their\r\nwritings and denounced them to the magistrates, and that he did\r\nprecisely towards them what he blamed the Pope for doing to himself.\r\nLuther found it difficult to meet this line of argument. Much against\r\nhis will he was obliged to support his opinions by appealing to the\r\ntradition of the Church and the writings of the Fathers, which latter\r\nhe had denounced as \"fetid pools whence Christians have been drinking\r\nunwholesome draughts instead of slaking their thirst from the pure\r\nfountain of Holy Scripture.\"[5] \"This article (The Eucharist),\" he\r\nwrote, \"is neither unscriptural nor a dogma of human invention. It is\r\nbased upon the clear and irrefragable words of Holy Writ. It has been\r\nuniformly held and believed throughout the whole Christian world from\r\nthe foundation of the Church to the present time. That such has been\r\nthe fact is attested by the writings of the Holy Fathers, both Greek\r\nand Latin, by daily usage and by the uninterrupted practice of the\r\nChurch. . . . To doubt it, therefore, is to disbelieve the Christian\r\nChurch and to brand her as heretical, and with her the prophets,\r\napostles, and Christ Himself, who, in establishing the Church said:\r\n'Behold I am with you all days even to the consummation of the\r\nworld.'\"[6]\r\n\r\nThe opposition of Luther did not put an end to the controversy. The\r\nZwinglian theories spread rapidly in Switzerland, whence they were\r\ncarried into Germany, much to the annoyance of Luther and of the\r\nProtestant princes for whom religious unity was necessary at almost\r\nany cost. Luther would listen to no schemes of compromise. He\r\ndenounced the Zwinglians in the most violent terms, as servants of the\r\ndevil, liars, and heretics for whose salvation no man should pray.\r\nHaving rejected Transubstantiation in order to rid himself of the\r\nsacrificial idea and of the doctrine of a Christian priesthood, he\r\nfought strongly for the Real Presence on the ground that God's body,\r\nbeing united to the divinity, enjoyed the divine attribute of\r\nubiquity. To this Zwingli made the very effective rejoinder that if\r\nthe words of Scripture \"This is My body and this is My blood\" are to\r\nbe interpreted literally they could bear only the sense put upon them\r\nby the Catholics, because Christ did not say \"My body is in or under\r\nthis bread,\" but rather \"This (the bread) is My body.\" Furthermore, he\r\npointed out that Luther's explanation concerning the ubiquity of\r\nChrist's body led clearly to a confusion of the divine and human\r\nnature of Christ, and was in consequence only a renewal of the\r\nMonophysite heresy, condemned by the whole Christian Church.\r\n\r\nThis unseemly dispute between the two leaders of the new movement did\r\nnot please the Protestant princes of Germany, for whom division of\r\ntheir forces might mean political extinction. The Elector of Saxony\r\nsupported Luther warmly, while Philip of Hesse was more or less\r\ninclined to side with Zwingli. A conference was arranged between the\r\ntwo parties at Marburg (1529), at which Luther and Oecolampadius were\r\npresent to defend their views. On a few secondary matters an agreement\r\nwas arrived at, but on the main question, the Real Presence, Luther\r\nwould yield nothing, and so the Reformers were divided into two\r\nparties, German Lutherans and Swiss Reformed.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] /Precis Historique de l'Abbaye et du Pelerinage de Notre-Dame-des-\r\n    Ermites/, 1870.\r\n\r\n[2] /Realencycl. fur Protestantische Theol./, xxi., p. 778.\r\n\r\n[3] Schwane, op. cit., p. 141.\r\n\r\n[4] Schwane, op. cit., p. 349.\r\n\r\n[5] Dollinger, /Die Reformation/, i., pp. 430-51.\r\n\r\n[6] Alzog, iii., 256-7.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         (c) Northern Europe.\r\n\r\n  See bibliography, chap. ii.

The\r\nbishops, as in most countries at the time, held enormous estates,\r\ngranted to their predecessors by the crown or bequeathed by generous\r\nbenefactors for the maintenance of religion. Unfortunately, with some\r\nexceptions, they were not men zealous for religious interests, or\r\ncapable of understanding that a serious crisis was at hand. In every\r\ndirection the need of reform was only too apparent, and, as such as\r\nwork had not been undertaken by those who should have undertaken it, a\r\nsplendid opportunity was afforded to the men who desired not the\r\nwelfare of religion but rather the overthrow of the Church.\r\n\r\nChristian II. (1513-23) wished to put an end to the supremacy of the\r\nbishops and nobles and to assert for himself and his successors\r\nabsolute control. He was a man of great ability and determination,\r\nwell acquainted with the tendencies of the age, and not particularly\r\nscrupulous about the means by which the success of his policy might be\r\nassured. To such a man Luther's attack on the bishops of Germany\r\nseemed to be almost providential. He realised that by embracing the\r\nnew religious system, which enabled him to seize the wealth of the\r\nChurch and to concentrate in his own hands full ecclesiastical power,\r\nhe could rid himself of one of the greatest obstacles to absolutism,\r\nand secure for himself and his successors undisputed sway in Denmark.\r\nThough his own life was scandalously immoral he determined to become\r\nthe champion of a religious reformation, and against the wishes of the\r\nnobles, clergy, and people he invited a disciple of Luther's to\r\nCopenhagen, and placed at his disposal one of the city's churches.\r\nThis step aroused the strongest opposition, but Christian, confident\r\nthat boldness meant success, adopted stern measures to overcome his\r\nopponents. He proclaimed himself the patron of those priests who were\r\nwilling to disregard their vows of celibacy, issued regulations\r\nagainst the unmarried clergy, and appealed to the people against the\r\nbishops and the nobles. As the Archbishop-elect of Lund was unwilling\r\nto show himself to be coerced into betraying the interests confided to\r\nhis charge, the king commanded that he should be put to death.\r\n\r\nBy these violent methods he had hoped to frighten his subjects into\r\ncompliance with his wishes, but he was doomed to speedy and complete\r\ndisappointment. The bishops and barons, though divided on many\r\nquestions, were at one in their resistance to such despotism, and they\r\nhad behind them the great body of the people, who had little if any\r\ndesire for a religious revolution. Christian II. was deposed, and in\r\nhis place his uncle, Frederick I. (1523-33), became king of Denmark.\r\nAt his coronation the new monarch pledged himself to defend the\r\nCatholic religion and to suppress heresy. Soon, however, motives\r\nsimilar to those that had influenced his predecessor induced him also\r\nto lean towards Lutheranism. At first his efforts for the spread of\r\nthe new teaching were carried out secretly, but once he felt himself\r\nsecure on the throne, he proclaimed himself publicly a Lutheran (1526)\r\nand invited Lutheran preachers to the capital. A Diet was called in\r\n1527 at Odensee to consider the religious controversy that had arisen.\r\nIn this assembly the king, basing his defence on the ground that\r\nthough he had pledged himself to protect the Catholic Church he was\r\nunder no obligation to tolerate abuses, contended that the suppression\r\nof abuses and the purifying of religion were the only objects he had\r\nat heart in the measures that he had taken. Owing mainly to his own\r\nstubbornness and the cowardly and wavering attitude of the bishops, it\r\nwas agreed by the Diet that till a General Council could be convoked\r\nfull toleration should be given to the Lutheran preachers, that in the\r\nmeantime no civil disabilities should be inflicted on supporters of\r\nthe new religion, that those of the clergy who wished to marry should\r\nbe allowed to do so, that the archbishop should apply no longer to\r\nRome for his pallium, and finally that the confirmation of the\r\nappointment of bishops should be transferred from the Pope to the\r\nking.\r\n\r\nBy these measures, to which the bishops offered only a faint\r\nopposition, Denmark was separated practically from the Holy See, and\r\nthe first step was taken on the road that was to lead to national\r\napostasy. The next important measure was the disputation arranged by\r\nthe king to take place at Copenhagen in 1529. The very fact that at\r\nthis meeting no Danish ecclesiastic capable of defending the Catholic\r\nfaith was to be found, and that it was necessary to have recourse to\r\nGermany for champions of orthodoxy, is in itself a sufficient\r\nindication of the character of the bishops who then ruled in Denmark,\r\nand of the state of learning amongst the Danish clergy of the period.\r\nEck and Cochlaeus were invited to come to Copenhagen, but as they had\r\nsufficient work to engage their attention at home, the duty of\r\nupholding Catholic doctrine devolved upon Stagefyr, a theologian of\r\nCologne.[1] He could not speak Danish, nor would the Lutheran party\r\nconsent to carry on the conference in Latin. Furthermore, he claimed\r\nthat the authority of the Fathers and the decrees of previous General\r\nCouncils should be recognised, but the Lutherans insisted that the\r\nBible was the only source from which Christians should receive their\r\ndoctrines. In these circumstances, since a disputation was impossible,\r\nboth parties agreed to submit a full statement of their views in\r\nwriting to the king and council, who, as might have been anticipated,\r\ndecided in favour of Lutheranism.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of his reign, Frederick I. spared no pains to\r\nsecure the victory for the new teaching in his dominions. The nobles\r\nwere won over to the king's views by promises of a share in the\r\npartition of ecclesiastical property, and those who wished to stand\r\nwell with the sovereign were not slow in having recourse to violence\r\nas affording proof that their zeal for Lutheranism was sincere.\r\nConsequently the Lutheran party found themselves in a majority in the\r\nDiet of 1530, and were powerful enough to do as they pleased. In\r\naccordance with the example set in Germany and Switzerland attacks\r\nwere begun on churches, pictures, and statues, but in many places the\r\npeople were not prepared for such changes, and bitter conflicts took\r\nplace between the rival parties. In the confusion that resulted the\r\nsupporters of the deposed king rose in arms against his successful\r\nrival, and the country was subjected to the horrors of civil war.\r\nFrederick I. found it necessary to abandon the violent propagation of\r\nLutheranism and to offer toleration to the Catholics.\r\n\r\nOn his death in 1533 the bishops of Denmark protested against the\r\nsuccession of his son Christian III. (1533-51) who was a personal\r\nfriend of Luther, and who had already introduced Protestantism into\r\nhis own state of Holstein; but as the nobles, won over by promises of\r\na share in the spoliation of the Church, refused to make common cause\r\nwith the bishops, their protest was unheeded. Confident that he could\r\nrely on the support of the nobles, the king gave secret instructions\r\nto his officials that on a certain day named by him all the bishops of\r\nDenmark should be arrested and lodged in prison. His orders were\r\ncarried out to the letter (1536), and so rejoiced was Luther by this\r\nstep that he hastened to send the king his warmest congratulations.\r\nThe bishops were offered release on condition that they should resign\r\ntheir Sees and pledge themselves to offer no further opposition to the\r\nreligious change. To their shame be it said that only one of their\r\nnumber, Ronnow, Bishop of Roskilde, refused to accept liberty on such\r\ndisgraceful terms, preferring to remain a prisoner until he was\r\nreleased by death (1544). The priests who refused to accept the new\r\nreligion were driven from their parishes, and several monasteries and\r\nconvents were suppressed.\r\n\r\nTo complete the work of reform and to give the Church in Denmark a new\r\nconstitution Bugenhagen, a disciple of Luther, was invited to the\r\ncapital (1539). He began by crowning the king according to Lutheran\r\nritual, and by drawing up a form of ecclesiastical government that\r\nplaced full spiritual power in the hands of the civil ruler. As in\r\nGermany, superintendents were appointed in room of the bishops who had\r\nresigned. When the work of drawing up the new ecclesiastical\r\norganisation had been finished it was submitted to and approved of by\r\nthe Diet held at Odensee in 1539. In another Diet held in 1546 the\r\nCatholic Church in Denmark was completely overthrown, her possessions\r\nwere confiscated, her clergy were forbidden to remain in the country\r\nunder penalty of death, and all lay Catholics were declared incapable\r\nof holding any office in the state or of transmitting their property\r\nto their Catholic heirs. By those measures Catholicism was suppressed,\r\nand victory was secured for the Lutheran party.\r\n\r\nNorway, which was united with Denmark at this period, was forced into\r\nsubmission to the new creed by the violence of the Danish kings, aided\r\nas they were by the greedy nobles anxious to share in the plunder of\r\nthe Church. Similarly Iceland, which was subject to Denmark, was\r\nseparated from Rome, though at first the people offered the strongest\r\nresistance to the reformers. The execution, however, of their bishop,\r\nJohn Aresen, the example of Denmark and Norway, and the want of\r\ncapable religious leaders produced their effects, and in the end\r\nIceland was induced to accept the new religion (1551). For a\r\nconsiderable time Catholicism retained its hold on a large percentage\r\nof the people both in Norway and Iceland, but the severe measures\r\ntaken by the government to ensure the complete extirpation of the\r\nCatholic hierarchy and priesthood led almost of necessity to the\r\ntriumph of Lutheranism.\r\n\r\nBy the Union of Kalmar (1397) Sweden, Norway, and Denmark were united\r\nunder the rule of the King of Denmark. The Union did not, however,\r\nbring about peace. The people of Sweden disliked the rule of a\r\nforeigner, and more than once they rose in rebellion against Denmark.\r\nIn the absence of a strong central authority the clergy and nobles\r\nbecame the dominant factors in the state, especially as they took the\r\nlead in the national agitations against King Erik and his successors.\r\nAs in most other countries at the time, the Church was exceedingly\r\nwealthy, the bishoprics and abbacies being endowed very generously,\r\nbut unfortunately, as elsewhere, the progress of religion was not in\r\nproportion to the worldly possessions of its ministers. Endowment had\r\ndestroyed the liberty of election so essential for good\r\nadministration, with the result that the bishops and other\r\necclesiastical dignitaries were selected without much regard for their\r\nqualifications as spiritual guides. Yet it must be said that in\r\ngeneral the administrators of the ecclesiastical property were not\r\nhard task-masters when compared with their lay contemporaries, nor was\r\nthere anything like a strong popular feeling against the Church. Still\r\nthe immense wealth of the religious institutions, the prevalence of\r\nabuses, and the failure of the clergy to instruct the people in the\r\nreal doctrines of their faith were a constant source of menace to the\r\nChurch in Sweden, and left it open to a crushing attack by a leader\r\nwho knew how to win the masses to his side by proclaiming himself the\r\nchampion of national independence and of religious reform.\r\n\r\nIn 1515 Sten Sture, the administrator of Sweden, supported by the\r\nBishop of Linkoping as leader of the popular party, made a gallant\r\nattempt to rally his countrymen to shake off the Danish yoke.\r\nUnfortunately for the success of his undertaking he soon found a\r\ndangerous opponent in the person of Gustaf Trolle, Archbishop of\r\nUpsala, the nominee and supporter of the King of Denmark. The\r\narchbishop threw the whole weight of his influence into the scales of\r\nDenmark, and partly owing to his opposition, partly owing to the want\r\nof sufficient preparation the national uprising was crushed early in\r\n1520. Christian II. was crowned King of Sweden by the Archbishop of\r\nUpsala. He signified his elevation to the throne by a general massacre\r\nof his opponents which lasted for two days, and during which many of\r\nthe best blood of Sweden were put to death (Nov. 1520). The archbishop\r\nwas rewarded for his services to Denmark by receiving an appointment\r\nas region or administrator of Sweden. He and his party made loud boast\r\nof their political victory, but had they been gifted with a little\r\nprudence and zeal they would have found good reason to regret a\r\ntriumph that had been secured by committing the Church to the support\r\nof a Danish tyrant against the wishes of the majority who favoured\r\nnational independence. Religion and patriotism were brought into\r\nserious conflict, and, given only a capable leader who would know how\r\nto conduct his campaign with skill, it was not difficult to foresee\r\nthe results of such a conflict.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, such a leader was at hand in the person of Gustaf\r\nEriksson, better known as Gustavus Vasa. His father had been put to\r\ndeath in the massacre of Stockholm, and he himself when a youth had\r\nbeen given as a hostage to the King of Denmark. He made his escape and\r\nfled to Lubeck, where he was kindly received, and remained until an\r\nopportunity arose for his return to Sweden. He placed himself\r\nimmediately at the head of the party willing to fight against Denmark,\r\ncalled upon his countrymen to rally to his standard, and in a short\r\ntime succeeded in driving the Danish forces from Sweden. He was\r\nproclaimed administrator of his country in 1521, and two years later a\r\nnational Diet assembled at Strengnas offered him the crown.\r\n\r\nSuch an offer was in exact accordance with his own wishes. But he had\r\nno intention of becoming king of Sweden merely to remain a tool in the\r\nhands of the spiritual and lay lords as the kings of Denmark had\r\nremained. Determined in his own mind to make himself absolute ruler of\r\nSweden by crushing the bishops and barons, he recognised that Luther's\r\nteaching, with which he was familiar owing to his stay at Lubeck, held\r\nout good hopes for the success of such a project. The warm attachment\r\nof the Bishop of Upsala for the Danish faction had weakened the\r\ndevotion of the people to the Church, and had prepared the way for the\r\nchange which Gustavus contemplated. Some of the Swedish ecclesiastics,\r\nnotably the brothers Olaf and Laurence Peterson, both students of\r\nWittenberg, the former a well-known preacher at Stockholm, the latter\r\na professor at Upsala, were strongly Lutheran in their tendencies, and\r\nwere ready to assist the king. Though in his letters to Rome and in\r\nhis public pronouncements Gustavus professed himself to be a sincere\r\nson of the Church, anxious only to prevent at all costs the spread of\r\nLutheranism in his dominions, he was taking steps secretly to\r\nencourage his Lutheran supporters and to rid himself of the bishops\r\nand members of the religious orders from whom he feared serious\r\nopposition. As was done elsewhere, he arranged for a public\r\ndisputation at which Olaf Peterson undertook to defend the main\r\nprinciples advocated by Luther, but the results of the controversy\r\nwere not so satisfactory for his party as he had anticipated.\r\n\r\nGustavus now threw off the mask of hypocrisy, and came forward boldly\r\nas the champion of the new religion. He removed those bishops who were\r\nmost outspoken in their opposition, banished the Dominicans who stood\r\nloyal to Rome, and tried to force the clergy to accept the change.\r\nAnxious to enrich his treasury by confiscating the wealth of the\r\nChurch he scattered broadcast Luther's pamphlet on the confiscation of\r\necclesiastical property, and engaged the professors of the University\r\nof Upsala to use their efforts to defend and popularise the views it\r\ncontained. A commission was appointed to make an inventory of the\r\ngoods of the bishops and religious institutions and to induce the\r\nmonasteries to make a voluntary surrender of their property. By means\r\nof threats and promises the commissioners secured compliance with the\r\nwishes of the king in some districts, though in others, as for example\r\nin Upsala, the arrival of the commission led to scenes of the greatest\r\nviolence and commotion. More severe measures were necessary to overawe\r\nthe people, and Gustavus was not a man to hesitate at anything likely\r\nto promote the success of his plans. Bishop Jakobson and some of the\r\nclergy were arrested, and after having been treated with every species\r\nof indignity were put to death (1527).\r\n\r\nIn this year, 1527, a national Diet was held at Vesteras principally\r\nfor the discussion of the religious difficulties that had arisen. Both\r\nparties, the supporters of the old and of the new, mustered their\r\nforces for a final conflict. Gustavus took the side of the so-called\r\nreformers, and proposed the measures which he maintained were required\r\nboth in the interests of religion and of the public weal. The Catholic\r\nparty were slightly in the majority and refused to assent to these\r\nproposals. Gustavus, though disappointed at the result, did not\r\ndespair. He announced to the Diet that in view of its refusal to agree\r\nto his terms he could undertake no longer the government and defence\r\nof the country. A measure such as this, calculated to lead to anarchy\r\nand possibly to a new subjugation of the country by Denmark, was\r\nregarded by both sides as a national disaster, and secured for the\r\nking the support of the waverers. The masses of the people were\r\nalarmed lest their opposition might lead to the restoration of Danish\r\ntyranny, while the support of the nobles was secured by the\r\npublication of a decree authorising them to resume possession of all\r\nproperty handed over by their ancestors to religious institutions for\r\nthe last eighty years. The remainder of the possessions of the Church\r\nwere appropriated for the royal treasury. The king now issued a\r\nproclamation in favour of the new religion, insisted on the adoption\r\nof a liturgy in the vulgar tongue, and abolished clerical celibacy. At\r\nthe National Assembly of Orebro (1529) the Catholic religion was\r\nabolished in favour of Lutheranism, and two years later Laurence\r\nPeterson was appointed first Lutheran Archbishop of Upsala.\r\n\r\nThough the Lutheran teaching had been accepted, great care was taken\r\nnot to shock the people by any violent change. Episcopal government of\r\nthe Church was retained; most of the Catholic ritual in regard to the\r\nsacraments and the Mass was adopted in the new liturgy, and even in\r\nsome cases the pictures and statues were not removed from the\r\nchurches. But the revolution that Gustavus had most at heart was fully\r\naccomplished. The authority of the Pope had been overthrown, and in\r\nhis place the king had been accepted as the head of the Swedish\r\nChurch. Nor did the Lutheran bishops find themselves in the enjoyment\r\nof greater liberty and respect as a result of their treason to the\r\nChurch. Gustavus warned them that they must not carry themselves like\r\nlords, and if they would attempt to wield the sword he would know how\r\nto deal with them in a summary manner. Resenting such dictation and\r\ntyranny they began to attack Gustavus in their sermons and to organise\r\nplots for the overthrow of his government. The conspiracy was\r\ndiscovered (1540). Olaf and Laurence Peterson, the two prominent\r\nleaders of the reforming party, were condemned to death, but were\r\nreprieved on the payment of a large fine. Laurence was, however,\r\nremoved from his position as Archbishop of Upsala. In the Diet of\r\nVesteras in 1544 the crown of Sweden was declared to be hereditary,\r\nand was vested in the family and heirs of Gustavus. Thus the well-\r\nconsidered policy of Gustavus was crowned with success. By means of\r\nthe Lutheran revolt he had changed the whole constitution of the\r\ncountry, had made himself absolute master of Sweden, and had secured\r\nthe succession to the throne for his own family.\r\n\r\nBut he had not broken the power of his opponents so completely as to\r\nbring peace to his country, nor, if credence be given to the\r\nproclamations in which he bewailed the increase of evil under the plea\r\nof evangelical freedom, did the reformed religion tend to the\r\nelevation of public morals. On his death in 1560 he was succeeded by\r\nhis son Erik XIV. (1560-9). Hardly had the new king been proclaimed\r\nthan the principle of private judgment introduced by the reformers\r\nbegan to produce its natural results. Calvinism, which was so opposed\r\nto Lutheranism both in doctrine and in church government, found its\r\nway into Sweden, and attracted the favourable notice of the king.\r\nRegardless for the time being of the Catholic Church, which to all\r\nappearances was dead in Sweden, the two parties, Lutherans and\r\nCalvinists, struggled for supremacy. Erik was won over to the side of\r\nthe Calvinists, and measures were taken to overcome the Lutherans by\r\nforce, but the king had neither the capacity nor the energy of his\r\nfather. The plan miscarried; the Calvinists were defeated (1568), and\r\nErik was deposed and imprisoned.\r\n\r\nHis younger brother John succeeded to the throne under the title John\r\nIII. He was a man of considerable ability, and was by no means\r\nsatisfied with the new religion. His marriage with Catharine, sister\r\nof Sigismund, King of Poland, herself a devoted Catholic, who\r\nstipulated for liberty to practice her religion, helped to make him\r\nmore favourable to a Catholic revival. He set himself to study the\r\nScriptures and writings of the Holy Fathers under the guidance of\r\nCatharine's chaplains, and convinced himself that he should return to\r\nthe Catholic Church and endeavour to rescue his country from the\r\ncondition of heresy into which it had fallen. He allowed the monks and\r\nnuns who were still in Sweden to form communities again, and\r\nendeavoured to win over the clergy by a series of ordinances couched\r\nin a Catholic tone which he issued for their guidance. In 1571 he\r\ninduced the Archbishop of Upsala to publish a number of regulations\r\nknown as the /Agenda/, which both in ritual and doctrine indicated a\r\nreturn to Rome, and he employed some Jesuit missionaries to explain\r\nthe misrepresentations of Catholic doctrine indulged in by the\r\nLutheran and Calvinist leaders. His greatest difficulty in bringing\r\nabout a reunion was the presence of Lutheran bishops, but fortunately\r\nfor him many of them were old men whose places were soon vacant by\r\ndeath, to whose Sees he appointed those upon whom he could rely for\r\nsupport. When he thought the time was ripe he summoned a National\r\nSynod in 1574, where he delivered an address deploring the sad\r\ncondition to which religious dissensions had reduced the country. He\r\npointed out that such a state of affairs had been brought about by the\r\nReformation and could be remedied only by a return to the Church. The\r\naddress received from the clergy a much more favourable reception than\r\nhe had anticipated. As the Archbishopric of Upsala was vacant, he\r\nsecured the election of an archbishop, who have his adhesion to\r\nseventeen articles of faith wholly satisfactory to Catholics, and who\r\nallowed himself to be consecrated according to the Catholic ritual. He\r\npromised also to use his influence to secure the adhesion of the other\r\nbishops. In 1576 the king issued a new liturgy, /The Red Book of\r\nSweden/, which was adopted by the Diet in 1577, and accepted by a\r\nlarge body of the clergy. Its principal was the king's brother, Karl,\r\nDuke of Suthermanland, who for political reasons had constituted\r\nhimself head of the Lutheran party, and who refused to agree with the\r\nRoman tendencies of the king on the ground that they were opposed to\r\nthe last wishes of Gustavus and to the laws of Sweden. A disputation\r\nwas arranged to take place at Upsala, where the Belgian Jesuit,\r\nLaurence Nicolai, vindicated triumphantly against his Lutheran\r\nopponents the Catholic teaching on the Church and the Mass. Copies of\r\nthe celebrated catechism of the Blessed Peter Canisius were circulated\r\nthroughout Sweden, and made an excellent impression on the people.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by these hopeful signs, the king despatched an embassy to\r\nRome to arrange for the reconciliation of Sweden to the Church. The\r\nroyal commissioners were instructed to request, that owing to the\r\npeculiar circumstances of the country, permission should be given for\r\nCommunion under both kinds, for the celebration of the Mass in the\r\nSwedish language, and for the abrogation of the law of celibacy at\r\nleast in regard to the clergy who were already married. Gregory XIII.,\r\ndeeply moved by the king's offer of a reunion, sent the Jesuit,\r\nAnthony Possevin, as his legate to discuss the terms. John set an\r\nexample himself by abjuring publicly his errors and by announcing his\r\nsubmission to the Church (1578).\r\n\r\nA commission was appointed at Rome to discuss the concessions which\r\nthe king demanded, and unfortunately the decision was regarded in\r\nSweden as unfavourable. A warm controversy, fomented and encouraged by\r\nthe enemies of reunion, broke out between the opponents and supporters\r\nof the new liturgy. Duke Karl, who had now become the hope of the\r\nLutheran party, did everything he could to stir up strife, while at\r\nthe same time Rome refused to accept the terms proposed by the king.\r\nIndignant at what he considered the unreasonable attitude of the Roman\r\nauthorities, John began to lose his enthusiasm for his religious\r\npolicy, and after the death of his wife who was unwavering in her\r\ndevotion to her religion, there was no longer much hope that Sweden\r\nwas to be won from heresy (1584). The king married another who was\r\nstrongly Lutheran in her sympathies, and who used her influence over\r\nhim to secure the expulsion of the Jesuits. Though John III. took no\r\nfurther steps to bring about reunion he could not be induced to\r\nwithdraw the liturgy, the use of which he insisted upon till his death\r\nin 1592.\r\n\r\nHis son Sigismund III. should have succeeded. He was an ardent\r\nCatholic as his mother had been, but as he had been elected King of\r\nPoland (1586) he was absent from Sweden when the throne became vacant\r\nby the death of his father. Duke Karl and his friends did not fail to\r\ntake advantage of his absence. When the Synod met the senators\r\ndemanded that Sigismund should accept the Augsburg Confession as a\r\ncondition for his election to the throne. To this Sigismund sent the\r\nonly reply that a good Catholic and an honest man could send, namely,\r\na blunt refusal. His uncle, Duke Karl, the acting regent of Sweden,\r\ntook steps to seduce the Swedish people from their allegiance to their\r\nlawful king, and to prepare the way for his own accession. He\r\nproclaimed himself the protector of Lutheranism and endeavoured to win\r\nover the bishops to his side. In a national Assembly held at Upsala\r\n(The \"Upsala-mote\" 1593) after a very violent address from the regent\r\nagainst the Catholic Church, the bishops confessed that they had\r\nblundered in accepting the liturgy of John III., and the Assembly\r\ndeclared itself strongly in favour of the Augsburg Confession.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, Sigismund returned to claim the throne he found that\r\nLutheranism was entrenched safely once more, and that even the most\r\nmoderate of the bishops appointed by his father must be reckoned with\r\nas opponents. The clergy united with Duke Karl in stirring up the\r\npeople against him. In these conditions he was forced to abandon his\r\nprojects of reform, and to entrust his uncle with the administration\r\nof Sweden when he himself was obliged to return to Poland. While\r\nSigismund was engaged in Poland, the regent conducted a most skilful\r\ncampaign, nominally on behalf of Protestantism, but in reality to\r\nsecure the deposition of Sigismund and his own election to the throne.\r\nIn the Diet of Suderkoping (1595) Sigismund was condemned for having\r\nbestowed appointments on Catholics and for having tolerated the\r\nCatholic religion in his kingdom of Sweden, and it was ordered that\r\nall who professed the doctrines of Rome should abandon their errors\r\nwithin six months under pain of expulsion from the country. The\r\nArchbishop of Upsala made a visitation of the churches, during which\r\nhe ordered that all those who absented themselves from the Lutheran\r\nservice should be flogged in his presence, that the pictures, statues,\r\nand reliquaries should be destroyed, and that the liturgy introduced\r\nby John III. should be abolished. The greatest violence was used\r\ntowards the supporters of King Sigismund, most of whom were either\r\nCatholic or at least favourably inclined towards Catholicism.\r\n\r\nEnraged by a decree that no edict of the king should have any binding\r\nforce unless confirmed by the Swedish Diet, and driven to desperation\r\nby the tyranny and oppression of the regent, some of Sigismund's\r\nfollowers raised the standard on behalf of their king, and Sigismund\r\nreturned to Sweden with an army of five thousand men. He found himself\r\nopposed by the forces of the regent against whom he was at first\r\nsuccessful, but in his treatment of his uncle and his rebel followers\r\nhe showed himself far too forgiving. In return for his kindness,\r\nhaving strengthened themselves by a large army they forced him to\r\nsubmit to the decision of a national Assembly to be held at Jonkoping\r\n(1599). At this meeting Duke Karl accused the king of endeavouring to\r\nplunge Sweden once more into the errors from which it had been rescued\r\nby the reformers. In May of the same year a resolution was passed\r\ndeclaring that the king had forfeited the allegiance of his subjects\r\nunless he yielded to their demands, and more especially unless he\r\nhanded over his son and heir to be reared by the regent as a\r\nProtestant. Many of his supporters, including nine members of the\r\nCouncil of State, were put to death. Finally in 1604 Sigismund was\r\nformally deposed, and the crown was bestowed on his uncle, Duke Karl,\r\nwho became king under the title of Charles IX. Protestantism had\r\ntriumphed at last in Sweden, but even its strongest supporters would\r\nhardly like to maintain that the issue was decided on religious\r\ngrounds, or that the means adopted by Charles IX. to secure the\r\nvictory were worthy of the apostle of a new religion.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] A Franciscan.

Calvin).\r\n\r\nJohn Calvin, from whom the heresy takes its name, was born at Noyon in\r\nPicardy in 1509. In accordance with the wishes of his father he\r\nstudied philosophy and theology at the University of Paris, where he\r\nwas supported mainly from the fruits of the ecclesiastical benefices\r\nto which he had been appointed to enable him to pursue his studies.\r\nLater on he began to waver about his career in life, and without\r\nabandoning entirely his hopes of becoming an ecclesiastic he turned\r\nhis attention to law in the Universities of Orleans and Bourges. In\r\nFrench intellectual circles of this period a certain spirit of unrest\r\nand a contempt for old views and old methods might be detected. The\r\nRenaissance ideas, so widespread on the other side of the Alps, had\r\nmade their way into France, where they found favour with some of the\r\nuniversity professors, and created a feeling of distrust and suspicion\r\nin the minds of those to whom Scholasticism was the highest ideal.\r\nMargaret of Navarre, sister of the king, showed herself the generous\r\npatron and defender of the new movement, and secured for it the\r\nsympathy and to some extent the support of Francis I. A few of the\r\nfriends of the Renaissance in France were not slow to adopt the\r\nreligious ideas of Luther, though not all who were suspected of heresy\r\nby the extreme champions of Scholasticism had any intention of joining\r\nin a movement directed against the defined doctrines or constitution\r\nof the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\nAs a student at Bourges, Calvin was brought into close relations with\r\nMelchior Wolmar, a German Humanist, who was strongly Lutheran in his\r\ntendencies, and through whom he became enamoured of Luther's teaching\r\non Justification. On his return to Paris he was soon remarkable as a\r\nstrong partisan of the advanced section of the university, and by his\r\nability and determination he did much to win over the Renaissance\r\nparty to the religious teaching that had become so widespread in\r\nGermany. As a result of an address delivered by Nicholas Cop, rector\r\nof the university, and of several acts of violence perpetrated in the\r\ncapital by the friends of heresy Francis I. was roused to take action.\r\nCalvin, fearing death or imprisonment, made his escape from Paris to\r\nBasle (1534). Here he published his first and greatest theological\r\ntreatise, /Christianae Religionis Institutio/, which he dedicated to\r\nthe King of France (1536). The work was divided into four sections,\r\nnamely, God the Creator, God the Redeemer, Grace, and the External\r\nMeans for Salvation. Both in its style and in its arguments drawn from\r\nthe Scriptures, the Fathers, and the theologians of the Middle Ages,\r\nit was far superior, at least for educated readers, to the best that\r\nhad been produced by Luther and even to the /Loci Communes/ of\r\nMelanchthon.\r\n\r\nHe arrived at Basle at a time when a crisis had arisen in the\r\npolitical and religious development of Geneva. For a long period the\r\nHouse of Savoy was seeking for an opportunity to annex the territory\r\nof Vaud extending along the Lake of Geneva, and the episcopal cities\r\nof Geneva and Lausanne. Berne, too, had aspirations of a similar kind.\r\nThe authorities of Berne, having adopted the Zwinglian doctrine,\r\nthought that in it they had a means at their hand to detach Geneva and\r\nLausanne from any sympathy with Savoy and to secure these territories\r\nfor themselves. They despatched preachers to Geneva, where there were\r\nalready two political factions, one advocating a closer alliance with\r\nSavoy, another clamouring for a union with Berne. The supporters of\r\nBerne rallied round William Farel and the Zwinglian ministers, while\r\nthe friends of Savoy undertook to champion the old religion. The whole\r\nstruggle was at bottom political rather than religious, but the\r\ntriumph of the republican adherents of Berne meant victory for the\r\nreforming party in Geneva. The Duke of Savoy issued a declaration of\r\nwar against the rebels to whom the Canton of Berne had pledged support\r\n(1534). As a result the forces of Savoy were driven out of Geneva and\r\nthe Vaud, a close union was formed between Geneva and Berne, and every\r\neffort was made to spread the new religion in the city and among the\r\nVaudois. A Zwinglian university was established at Lausanne, which\r\nexercised a great influence in propagating the new doctrine, and which\r\nhad the honour of counting among its students Theodore Beza[1] the\r\nmost gifted and learned assistant of Calvin.\r\n\r\nBut though the Vaudois had been won over, Geneva was by no means\r\nsecured for the reformers. Farel and his followers, finding themselves\r\ninvolved in serious difficulties, appealed to Calvin to help them in\r\ncompleting the work they had begun. In 1536 Calvin accepted this\r\ninvitation, and took up his residence at Geneva. Gifted with great\r\npowers as an organiser and administrator he soon restored order in the\r\ncity, and won over the people to his doctrines. Himself a man of very\r\nstrict notions, in whose eyes all even the most harmless amusements\r\nappeared sinful or dangerous, he was determined that his followers\r\nmust accept his views. Under his rule Geneva, formerly so gay, became\r\nlike a city of death, where all citizens went about as if in mourning.\r\nSuch an unnatural condition of affairs could not be permanent. The\r\npeople soon grew tired of their dictator and of his methods; the\r\nauthorities of Berne were roused to hostility by his refusal to accept\r\ntheir doctrinal programme or their model religious organisation; the\r\nSynod of Lausanne declared against him for a similar reason, and in\r\n1538 he and his principal supporters were driven from the city.\r\nCardinal Sadoleto took occasion to address a stirring appeal to Geneva\r\nto return to the old faith, but his appeal fell upon deaf ears.\r\n\r\nCalvin retired at first to Strassburg, and later he took charge of a\r\nparish in France. During the interval he devoted himself to a closer\r\nstudy of the disputed religious questions, and wrote much in favour of\r\nthe Reformation. It was at this time (1540) that he married the widow\r\nof one of the Anabaptist leaders. Meanwhile Geneva was torn by\r\ndisputes between two factions, the Libertines as they were called, who\r\nwere opposed to Calvin, and the Guillermins, who clamoured for his\r\nreturn. The latter body gained ground rapidly, and a decree was issued\r\nrecalling Calvin to Geneva (October 1540). Knowing well that his\r\npresence was necessary to restore peace to the city he refused to\r\nreturn unless the conditions imposed by him should be accepted. In the\r\nend he went back to Geneva practically as its religious and political\r\ndictator (1541).\r\n\r\nThe form of government introduced was theocratic. Calvin was\r\nrecognised as the spiritual and temporal ruler of the city. He was\r\nassisted in the work of government by the Consistory, which was\r\ncomposed of six clerics and twelve laymen. The latter was the worst\r\nform of inquisition court, taking cognisance of the smallest\r\ninfractions of the rules laid down for the conduct of the citizens,\r\nand punishing them by the severest form of punishment. Any want of\r\nrespect for the Consistory or opposition to its authority was treated\r\nas a rebellion against God. Calvin formulated a very severe code of\r\nrules for the guidance of the people not merely in their duties as\r\ncitizens and as members of his religious organisation, but also in\r\ntheir social intercourse with one another. Even the privacy of family\r\nlife was not sacred in his eyes. All kinds of amusements, theatres,\r\ndances, cards, &c., were banned as ungodly, as were also extravagance\r\nof dress and anything savouring of frivolity. Nobody was allowed to\r\nsell wine or beer except a limited number of merchants licensed to do\r\nso by the Consistory.\r\n\r\nNor were these mere empty regulations designed only to keep religion\r\nbefore the eyes of the people without any intention of enforcing them.\r\nThe preachers were invested with extraordinary powers, and were\r\ncommissioned to make house to house visitations, to inquire about\r\nviolations of the rules. In their reports to the Congregation and to\r\nthe Consistory they noted even the most minute transgressions. Not\r\ncontent with this Calvin had his spies in all parts of the city, who\r\nreported to him what people were saying about his methods and his\r\ngovernment. The punishment meted out by the courts were of a very\r\nsevere and brutal kind. No torture that could be inflicted was deemed\r\ntoo much for any one bold enough to criticise the Consistory or the\r\ndictator.\r\n\r\nIt was natural that such methods should be highly distasteful to those\r\nof the citizens of Geneva who were not religious fanatics. A strong\r\nparty tried to resist him. They accused him of being much more\r\ntyrannical than the Pope, but Calvin denounced such opponents as\r\nlibertines, heretics, and atheists. He handed them over to the devil\r\nat least in so far as his ecclesiastical censures were effective,[2]\r\nthreatened the severest spiritual punishment against their aiders and\r\nabettors, and when all such means of reproof failed he had recourse to\r\nthe secular arm.\r\n\r\nSebastian Castellio, a well-known preacher and Scriptural scholar, was\r\npunished because he could not agree with Calvin's teaching on\r\npredestination, as was also the physician Bolsec; Ameaux one of the\r\nmembers of the Council was put to death because he denounced the\r\ntyranny of Calvin and of the Consistory; Gentilis was condemned to\r\nexecution for differing with Calvin's teaching on the Trinity, and was\r\ncompelled to make a most abject public retraction before he could\r\nobtain a reprieve. Several of the citizens were punished with long\r\nimprisonment for dancing even on the occasion of a wedding, as\r\nhappened in the case of Le Fevre, whose son-in-law was obliged to flee\r\nto France because he resented warmly such methods of promoting\r\nreligion. In Geneva and in the adjoining territory all Catholic\r\npractices were put down by violence, and the peasants were allowed no\r\nchoice in their religious views. Possibly, however, the most glaring\r\nexample of Calvin's tyranny and high-handed methods was his treatment\r\nof Michael Servetus, a Spaniard who had written against the Trinity.\r\nHe was on a journey through the territory of Geneva and was doing\r\nnothing to spread his doctrines nor acting in any way likely to bring\r\nhim under the ire of Calvin. The latter having heard of his presence\r\nthere had him arrested, tried, and condemned to death. To justify such\r\nharshness he published a pamphlet in which he advocated death as the\r\nonly proper remedy for heresy. Theodore Beza wrote strongly in support\r\nof this opinion of his master's, as did also Melanchthon who, though\r\ndiffering from Calvin on so many points, hastened to forward his\r\nwarmest congratulations on the execution of Servetus.[3]\r\n\r\nCalvin's acts of cruelty were not the result of violent outbursts of\r\ntemper. By nature cold and immovable, he did not allow himself to be\r\nhurried to extremes either by anger or by passion. How he succeeded in\r\nmaintaining his position for so many years in Geneva is intelligible\r\nonly to those who understand the strength of the religious fanaticism\r\nthat he was able to arouse amongst his followers, the terror which his\r\nspiritual and temporal punishments inspired among his opponents, his\r\nown wonderful capacity for organisation and administration, the\r\nactivity of his ministers and spies, and the almost perfect system of\r\nrepression that he adopted in his two-fold character of religious and\r\npolitical dictator.\r\n\r\nTo strengthen his position and to provide for the continuance of his\r\nsystem he established an academy at Geneva (1558) principally for the\r\nstudy of theology and philosophy. It was attended by crowds of\r\nscholars from Switzerland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, England,\r\nand Scotland. By means of the academy, Calvinism was spread throughout\r\nSwitzerland notwithstanding the opposition of the Zwinglian preachers,\r\nand Calvin's system of ecclesiastical organisation became the model\r\naimed at by his disciples in most countries of Europe, notably France,\r\nthe Netherlands, and Scotland. The Zurich school, at the head of which\r\nstood Bullinger, did not yield ground to the new teaching without a\r\nsevere struggle, and Calvin found himself obliged to come to terms\r\nwith them in the /Consensus Tigurninus/ (1549). In his desire to\r\nsecure the religious unity of Switzerland he had no difficulty in\r\nabandoning or minimising his own doctrine in the hope of overcoming or\r\nwinning over his opponents. After a life of tireless energy his health\r\nbegan to fail in 1561, and three years later he passed away (1564).\r\n\r\nCalvin was a man of morose and gloomy temperament, severe even to\r\nharshness with his followers, and utterly devoid of human sympathy.\r\nNot so however his disciple and assistant Theodore Beza. The latter\r\nwas born in Burgundy in 1519, and after completing his classical\r\nstudies at Orleans he drifted to Paris, where he plunged into all the\r\npleasures and dissipations of the capital, and where at first he was\r\nremarkable more for his love songs than for his theology. He devoted\r\nhimself to the study of law, and in 1539 he took his licentiate at\r\nParis. Having become attached to the opinions of the Swiss Reformers\r\nhe left Paris and settled at Geneva, where he fell completely under\r\nthe influence of Calvin, but not even Calvin's temperament and system\r\ncould change his naturally gay and sympathetic disposition. For this\r\nreason he became a general favourite, and did much to win the good-\r\nwill of those who felt themselves rebelled by the harshness of the\r\ndictator. Beza was, besides, a man of very superior ability, and had\r\nbeen especially well equipped in Hebrew and in the classics. He was\r\nmaster of a striking style whether he wrote in French or in Latin,\r\neloquent beyond most of his contemporaries, and in every way capable\r\nof making a good impression not merely on the ordinary citizen but on\r\nthe more educated classes. His writings in defence of Calvin's system\r\nand his translations of the Scriptures gave him a great reputation\r\nthroughout Europe, and gained for him a commanding position in Geneva,\r\nwhere he died in 1605.\r\n\r\nCalvin's system was modelled to a great extent on the doctrines of\r\nLuther and Zwingli, but it was coloured largely by his own harsh and\r\nmorose disposition. For the distinguishing feature of his system,\r\nnamely, absolute predestination, he was dependent largely upon the\r\nworks of Wycliffe. Like Luther, he began with the assumption that the\r\ncondition of man before the Fall was entirely natural, and that\r\nconsequently by the Fall he was deprived of something that was\r\nessential to his nature and without which human nature was completely\r\ncorrupted. Man was no longer free, and every act of his was sinful.\r\nHis want of freedom was the result of the play of external forces\r\ndirected and arranged by God, rather than of any internal necessity by\r\nwhich he was forced to sin. God is, according to Calvin, the author of\r\nsin, in the sense that he created a certain number of men to work evil\r\nthrough them in order that He might have an opportunity of displaying\r\nthe divine attribute of mercy. Hence the motive of God in bringing\r\nabout evil is different from the motive of the sinner, and therefore\r\nthough the sinner is blameworthy God is nowise responsible for his\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nAdam sinned because it was decreed by God that he should fall in order\r\nthat the divine mercy should be manifested to the world. For the same\r\nreason God did not intend that all should be equally good or that all\r\nshould be saved. He created some men that they might sin and that\r\ntheir punishment might afford an example of God's justice, while He\r\nmade others that they might be saved to show His overwhelming mercy.\r\nThe former are condemned to hell by an irreversible decree, the\r\nothers, the elect, are predestined absolutely to glory. The elect are\r\nassured of justification through the merits of Christ, and once\r\njustified they are always justified, for justification cannot be lost.\r\nFaith such as that advocated by Luther was the means of acquiring\r\njustification, but, mindful of his other doctrine that even the best\r\nof men's works are sinful, Calvin took care to explain that justifying\r\nfaith was only the instrument by which a man laid hold of the merits\r\nof Christ. It was like a vessel which, though containing some\r\npriceless treasure, was in itself worthless.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, Calvin refused to admit that the sacraments were\r\nendowed with any objective power of conferring Grace. In the case of\r\ntheir reception by the elect, however, he held that they were the\r\nmeans of strengthening the faith by which justification is acquired,\r\nbut for those predestined to damnation they were mere signs without\r\nany spiritual effect. In regard to the Eucharist, while he rejected\r\nthe Catholic view of Transubtantiation, he maintained against the\r\nLutherans that Impanation or Companation was equally absurd. Nor did\r\nhe agree with Zwingli that the Eucharist is a mere sign of Christ's\r\nlove for men. According to him Christ is really present, in the sense\r\nthat though the bread and wine remain unchanged, the predestined\r\nreceive with the Eucharistic elements a heavenly food that proceeds\r\nfrom the body of Christ in Heaven.\r\n\r\nLike Luther he contended that the true Church of Christ is invisible,\r\nconsisting in his view only of the predestined, but, realising the\r\nnecessity for authority and organisation, he was driven to hold that\r\nthe invisible Church manifested itself through a visible religious\r\nsociety. Unlike Luther, however, he was unwilling to subordinate the\r\nChurch to the civil power, believing as he did that it was a society\r\ncomplete in itself and entirely independent of temporal sovereigns.\r\nEach Calvinistic community should be to a great extent a self-\r\ngoverning republic, all of them bound together into one body by the\r\nreligious synods, to which the individual communities should elect\r\nrepresentatives. The churches were to be ruled by pastors, elders, and\r\ndeacons. Candidates for the sacred ministry were to receive the\r\nconfirmation of their vocation by a call from some Calvinistic church\r\nbody, and were to be ordained by the imposition of the hands of the\r\npresbyters or elders. For Calvin as for Luther the Holy Scriptures\r\nwere the sole rule of faith to be adopted by both the preachers and\r\nthe synods. The special illumination of the Holy Ghost was sufficient\r\nto guard individuals from being deceived either in determining what\r\nbooks are inspired, or what is the precise meaning which God wished to\r\nconvey in any particular book or passage.[4]\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] Baird, /Theodore Beza, Counsellor of the French Reform/, 1900.\r\n\r\n[2] Galli, /Die Lutheran, und Calvinist, Kirchenstrafen im\r\n    Reformationszeitalter/, 1878.\r\n\r\n[3] Rouquette, /L'Inquisition protestante.

See also bibliography, chap. iii. (a).\r\n\r\nMany causes combined to favour the introduction of the reformed\r\ndoctrines into France. Owing to the anti-papal attitude adopted by the\r\nFrench theologians during the Great Western Schism, there was still\r\nlurking in many circles a strong feeling against the Holy See and in\r\nfavour of a national Church, over which the Pope should retain merely\r\na supremacy of honour. Besides, the influence of the old sects, the\r\nAlbigenses and the Waldenses, had not disappeared entirely, and the\r\nprinciples of the French mystics favoured the theory of religious\r\nindividualism, that lay behind the whole teaching of the reformers.\r\nThe Renaissance, too, was a power in France, more especially in Paris,\r\nwhere it could boast of powerful patrons such as Margaret of Navarre,\r\nsister of Francis I. and wife of the King of Navarre, the king's\r\nmistress, his favourite minister Du Bellay, and the latter's brother,\r\nthe Bishop of Paris. Not all the French Humanists, however, were\r\nequally dangerous. A few of them were undoubtedly favourable to\r\nLuther's views, while many others, infuriated by the charges of\r\nunorthodoxy levelled against them, were inclined to look with\r\ncomplacency on whatever was condemned by their Scholastic opponents.\r\nThe proximity of Strassburg, where Lutheran and Zwinglian doctrines\r\nfound support, and the close relations existing between the Paris\r\nUniversity and German scholars helped to disseminate among Frenchmen\r\nthe writings of Erasmus, Luther, and Melanchthon and with them the new\r\nreligious views.\r\n\r\nAgainst the success of the Reformation in France was the fact that the\r\npeople, Latin rather than Teuton in their sympathies, were thoroughly\r\ndevoted to their religion and to the Holy See, that the bishops though\r\nnominated by the king according to the Concordat of 1516, were more\r\nzealous than their German brethren, that in the main Paris University,\r\nthen the great centre of intellectual life in France, was thoroughly\r\nCatholic, and that the queen-mother, the chancellor of state, the\r\nleading ministers both lay and ecclesiastic, and the parliamentary\r\nauthorities could be relied upon to offer Lutheranism their strongest\r\nopposition. Nor, however much Francis I. might be inclined to\r\nvacillate in the hope of securing the help of the German Protestant\r\nprinces in his struggle with the empire, had he any desire to see his\r\nkingdom convulsed by the religious strife raging on the other side of\r\nthe Rhine.\r\n\r\nIn 1521 the Parliament of Paris with the approval of the king forbade\r\nthe publication of writings dealing with the new religious views.\r\nLuther's books were condemned, and the Paris University drew up a list\r\nof erroneous propositions extracted from the works of the German\r\ntheologians (1523). At the request of the queen-mother the theological\r\nfaculty of Paris formulated a plan for preventing the spread of the\r\nGerman errors in France, the main points of which were that heretical\r\nbooks should be forbidden, that the bishops should be exhorted to seek\r\nout such works in their dioceses and have them destroyed, and that the\r\nSorbonne should have a free hand in maintaining religious unity. Yet\r\nin spite of these precautions a Lutheran community was formed at Meaux\r\nin the vicinity of Paris, and in the South of France, where the\r\nWaldensian party was still strong, Lutheran teaching found many\r\nsupporters. In some places various attempts were made to imitate the\r\ntactics adopted so successfully at Wittenberg and Berne to bring about\r\nby force the discontinuance of Catholic worship. But these attempts\r\nfailed, owing mainly to the independent attitude of the local\r\nparliaments and to the energy of the bishops, who removed one of the\r\nmost dangerous weapons wielded by the heretics by insisting on a\r\nthorough reform of the clergy.\r\n\r\nBut though Francis I. had been moved to take action against the\r\nsectaries, and though Calvin and other leaders were obliged to leave\r\nFrance, the reforming party, relying on the influence of patrons like\r\nMargaret of Navarre[1] and on the Humanist section at the university\r\nand at the newly established College de France, felt confident of\r\nultimate success. They realised that the king was most anxious to\r\narrive at an understanding with the Protestant princes of Germany\r\nagainst Charles V., and that therefore it was unlikely that he would\r\nindulge in a violent persecution of their co-religionists at home.\r\nThey knew, too, that Francis I. had set his heart on securing complete\r\ncontrol of the Church in his own dominions, as was evident by the hard\r\nbargain which he drove with Leo X. in the Corcordat of 1516,[2] and\r\nthey were not without hope that Luther's teaching on the spiritual\r\nsupremacy of the civil rulers might prove an irresistible bait to a\r\nman of such a temperament. Negotiations were opened with Francis I. by\r\nsome of the German reformers, who offered to accept most of the\r\nCatholic doctrines together with episcopal government if only the king\r\nwould support their cause (1534). As it was impossible to arrange for\r\na conference, the Lutheran party submitted a summary of their views\r\nembodied in twelve articles to the judgment of the Sorbonne. In reply\r\nto this communication the doctors of the Sorbonne, instead of wasting\r\ntheir energies in the discussion of particular tenets, invited the\r\nGermans to state explicitly whether or not they accepted the authority\r\nof the Church and the writings of the Fathers. Such an attitude put an\r\nend to all hopes of common action between the French and German\r\ntheologians, but at the same time Francis I. was not willing, for\r\npolitical reasons, to break with Protestantism. The publication,\r\nhowever, of a particularly offensive pamphlet against Catholicism,\r\nprinted in Switzerland and scattered broadcast throughout France,\r\nserved as a warning to the king that his own country was on the brink\r\nof being plunged into the civil strife which Protestantism had\r\nfomented in Germany, and that if he wanted to preserve national unity\r\nand peace the time for decisive action had arrived. Many of the\r\nleading reformers were arrested and some of them were put to death,\r\nwhile others were banished from France (1535).\r\n\r\nFrom this time the Lutherans began to lose hope of securing the active\r\nco-operation of Francis I., but the friendly political relations\r\nbetween the king and the German Protestant princes, together with the\r\nclose proximity of Strassburg, Geneva, and Berne, from which preachers\r\nand pamphlets made their way into France, helped to strengthen the\r\nheretical party in the country despite the efforts of the\r\necclesiastical and lay authorities. In the South many of the Waldenses\r\nin Dauphiny and Provence went over formally to the side of the\r\nCalvinists. In places where they possessed considerable strength they\r\nindulged in violent attacks on the clergy, for which reason severe\r\nmeasures of repression were adopted by the local administrators and by\r\nthe king. As in Switzerland, so too in France Calvinism proved to be\r\nthe most attractive of the new religious systems. Calvinistic\r\ncommunities were formed at Paris, Rouen, Lyons and Orleans, all of\r\nwhich looked to Geneva for direction. The name given to the French\r\nfollowers of Calvin was Huguenots.\r\n\r\nHenry II. (1547-59), who succeeded on the death of Francis I. had no\r\ndifficulty in allying himself with the German Protestants, and in\r\ndespatching an army to assist Maurice of Saxony in his rebellion\r\nagainst the Emperor, while at the same time taking every precaution\r\nagainst the spread of heresy at home. He established a new inquisition\r\ndepartment presided over by a Dominican for the detection and\r\npunishment of the Huguenots, and pledged the civil power to carry out\r\nits decisions. In this attitude he was supported strongly by the\r\nUniversity of Paris, which merited the heartiest congratulations of\r\nJulius III. by its striking defence of Catholic doctrines, especially\r\nthe necessity of obedience to the Holy See. Yet notwithstanding all\r\nmeasures taken against them the Huguenots continued to increase in\r\nnumbers. The Bishop of Navarre went over to their side, as did a\r\ncertain number of the clergy, and the attitude of some of the others\r\nwas uncertain. So strong did the Huguenot party find itself in France\r\nthat a Synod representing the different reformed communities was held\r\nin Paris in 1559, at which the doctrine and ecclesiastical\r\norganisation introduced by Calvin into Switzerland were formally\r\nadopted. The accession of Elizabeth to the throne in England, and the\r\nhopes entertained in France of detaching that country from Spain made\r\nthe French government less anxious to adopt severe measures against\r\nthe Protestants. After the Peace of Cateau Cambresis (1559), when\r\nHenry determined to make a great effort to extirpate Calvinism, he was\r\nprevented by death.\r\n\r\nFrancis II. who lived only one year (1559-60) succeeded, and he was\r\nfollowed by Charles IX. (1560-74). The latter of these was a mere\r\nchild, and during the minority the government of the country was in\r\nthe hands of Catharine de' Medici, his mother, who became regent of\r\nFrance. At the court two parties struggled for supremacy, the family\r\nof Guise which stood for Catholicism, and the Bourbons who favoured\r\nCalvinism. The regent, not being a woman of very decided religious\r\nconvictions or tendencies, set herself to play off one party against\r\nthe other so as to increase her own power, and in this way a splendid\r\nopportunity was given to the Calvinists to pursue their religious\r\ncampaign. Several of the more powerful people in the kingdom favoured\r\ntheir schemes solely out of hatred to the Duke of Guise[3] and with\r\nthe hope of lessening his power. Amongst the prominent Calvinist\r\nleaders at this period were Antoine de Bourbon,[4] King of Navarre,\r\nand his brother Louis Prince de Conde, the Constable de Montmorency\r\nand Admiral Coligny,[5] the recognised head and ablest leader of the\r\nHuguenot party.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of the bitter feeling aroused amongst their followers\r\nby the execution of some of their number, the Huguenots formed a\r\nconspiracy (Tumult of Amboise 1560) to seize the young king, to\r\noverthrow the Duke of Guise, and to set up in his place the Prince de\r\nConde. The Calvinist theologians, having been consulted about the\r\nlawfulness of such an enterprise, declared that the conspirators might\r\nproceed without fear of sinning so long as a prince of the royal\r\nfamily was amongst their leaders. The plot was discovered, however,\r\nbefore their plans were matured, and several of those who took part in\r\nit were put to death. Instead of weakening, it served only to\r\nstrengthen the family of Guise. Francis, Duke of Guise, was appointed\r\na lieutenant-general of France with the title of saviour of his\r\ncountry, while his brother, the Cardinal of Lorraine, became chief\r\ninquisitor and one of the papal legates appointed for the reform of\r\nabuses in France. The King of Navarre, to whom Pius IV. addressed a\r\npersonal appeal, confessed his unfaltering loyalty to the Catholic\r\nreligion, although at the same time he was doing much to spread\r\nCalvinism in his own dominions and throughout the South of France.\r\n\r\nThough the royal edict against the Calvinists, published in 1560, was\r\nsevere, yet little was done to enforce its terms except against those\r\nwho had recourse to arms. The Prince de Conde organised a new\r\nconspiracy and attempted to secure Lyons. He was arrested, tried, and\r\ncondemned to death, but before the sentence could be carried out\r\nFrancis II. passed away.\r\n\r\nA new grouping of parties now took place. The regent, Catharine de'\r\nMedici, alarmed at the growing influence of the Guise faction, threw\r\nthe whole weight of her influence into the scales in favour of the\r\nPrince de Conde and of the Huguenots. A royal edict was issued\r\nsuspending all prosecutions against heretics and ordering the release\r\nof all prisoners detained on account of their religion (1561). The\r\nregent wrote to the Pope praising the religious fervour of the\r\nCalvinists, and calling upon him to suppress several Catholic\r\npractices to which the heretics had taken exception. She professed\r\nherself anxious for a national council to settle the religious\r\ndifferences, and failing this she insisted upon a religious\r\ndisputation at Poissy. The disputation (\"Colloquy\" of Poissy) took\r\nplace (1561) in presence of the young king, his mother, and a large\r\nnumber of cardinals, bishops, and ministers of state. The Catholics\r\nwere represented by the Cardinal of Lorraine, the Jesuit General\r\nLainez, and other distinguished clergy, while the Calvinists sent a\r\nlarge number of their ablest leaders, conspicuous amongst whom were\r\nTheodore Beza and Francois de Morel. The principal doctrines in\r\ndispute, notably the authority of the Church and the Eucharist, were\r\ndiscussed at length without result. Then a small committee, composed\r\nof five theologians representing each side, was appointed, but without\r\nany better success. In the end, as no agreement could be secured, the\r\nconference was dismissed.\r\n\r\nOwing to the close alliance between the regent and the Prince de Conde\r\nthe former issued a new edict, in which she allowed the Calvinists\r\nfree exercise of their religion outside the cities provided that they\r\nassembled unarmed, commanded them to restore the goods and churches\r\nthey had seized, and forbade them to have recourse to violence or to\r\nconspiracies to promote their views (1562). Encouraged by these\r\nconcessions, the Calvinists especially in the South of France\r\nattempted to force their religion on the people. They attacked\r\nchurches, profaned the Blessed Sacrament, murdered several priests and\r\nlaymen, and obliged the peasants to listen to their preachers. Feeling\r\nbetween the two parties was extremely bitter, and the Catholics were\r\nespecially incensed that a small minority should be allowed to have\r\ntheir own way regardless of the opinions of the vast body of the\r\nFrench people.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances it required very little to lead to serious\r\nconflict. At Vassy some soldiers accompanying the Duke of Guise\r\nquarrelled with a party of Calvinists, whose psalm-singing was\r\ndisturbing the Mass at which the Duke was assisting. The latter,\r\nhearing the noise, hastened out to restore peace, and was struck with\r\na stone. His followers, incensed at this outrage, drew their swords\r\nand killed a large number of the Calvinists. This incident, referred\r\nto generally as the massacre of Vassy, led to a new civil war (1562).\r\nThe Calvinists hastened to take up arms, and the Prince de Conde was\r\nassured of English assistance. A large army attacked Toulouse, but\r\nafter a struggle lasting four days the Calvinists were defeated and\r\ndriven off with severe loss. In Normandy and other centres where they\r\nwere strong they carried on the war with unheard of cruelty; but as\r\nthey were in a hopeless minority and as the English failed to give\r\nthem the necessary assistance they lost many of their strongholds, and\r\nfinally suffered a terrible defeat at Dreux where the Prince de Conde\r\nwas taken prisoner (Dec. 1562). Coligny escaped to Orleans, which city\r\nwas besieged by the Duke of Guise, who was murdered during the siege\r\nby one of the followers of Coligny.[6] Before his execution the\r\nprisoner accused Coligny and Beza as being accessories to his crime,\r\nbut it is only fair to say that Coligny denied under oath the truth of\r\nthis statement.\r\n\r\nThough the Catholics were victorious the awful struggle had cost them\r\ndearly. Their ablest leader the Duke of Guise had fallen, as had also\r\nAntoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre, who had been converted from\r\nCalvinism; many of their churches and most valuable shrines were\r\ndestroyed; and to make matters worse they recognised that the struggle\r\nhad been fought in vain, as the regent proclaimed a general amnesty\r\nand concluded a peace with the Huguenots (Peace of Amboise, 1563),\r\nwhereby Calvinist nobles and their followers were allowed free\r\nexercise of their religion with certain restrictions.\r\n\r\nNeither side was satisfied with these terms. Coligny and the Prince de\r\nConde were annoyed furthermore by the fact that the regent broke off\r\nher close relations with them, and began to lean towards the Catholic\r\nside and toward an alliance with Spain. After raising large sums of\r\nmoney and arming their forces for a new effort they determined to\r\nseize the king and his court at Monceau, but the Constable de\r\nMontmorency with six thousand trusty Swiss soldiers hastened to the\r\nking's defence, and brought him safely from the midst of his enemies\r\n(1567). This attempt together with the terrible slaughter of Catholics\r\nat Nimes (29 Sept.)[7] led to the outbreak of the second civil war.\r\nThe Catholic forces were successful at St. Denis though they lost one\r\nof their ablest generals, the Constable de Montmorency, and were\r\ndeprived of the fruits of their victory by the intervention of the\r\nElector of the Palatinate. Owing to the mediation of the latter a new\r\ntreaty was made in 1568, but as the Huguenots continued to seek\r\nalliances with England, Germany, and the Netherlands, Charles IX.\r\nrecalled the concessions he had made, and forbade the exercise of\r\nCalvinist worship under penalty of death.\r\n\r\nThereupon the third civil war broke out (1569). The Huguenots received\r\nassistance from England, the Netherlands, and Germany, while the\r\nCatholics were supported by Spain and the Pope. The war was carried on\r\nwith relentless cruelty on both sides. In the battle of Jarnac the\r\nHuguenot forces were defeated, and the Prince de Conde was slain\r\n(1569). The struggle was however continued by Coligny supported by\r\nHenry King of Navarre and the young de Conde. By wonderful exertions\r\nColigny put a new army into the field only however to suffer another\r\nterrible defeat at Montcontour, where the Huguenots were almost\r\nannihilated. It seemed that the long struggle was to end at last and\r\nthat peace was to be restored to France. But unfortunately at this\r\njuncture some of his courtiers succeeded in convincing Charles IX.\r\nthat his brother, the Duke of Anjou, who with the young Duke of Guise\r\nwas mainly responsible for the Catholic victories, might use his\r\nrecognised military ability and his influence with the people to make\r\nhimself king of France. Alarmed by the prospect of such a contingency\r\nCharles IX., already jealous of his brother's triumphs, turned against\r\nthe Catholic party and concluded the Peace of St. Germain-en-Laye with\r\nthe Huguenots (1570).\r\n\r\nAccording to the terms of this Peace the Huguenots were allowed free\r\nexercise of their religion in France with the sole exception of the\r\ncapital. They were not to be excluded from any office of the state,\r\nand four of the strongest fortresses of the country, La Rochelle,\r\nMontauban, Cognac, and La Charite were to be delivered to them for\r\ntheir protection and as a guarantee of good faith. The whole policy of\r\nCharles IX. underwent a complete change. Obsessed with the idea that\r\nthe Catholic party, led by the Duke of Anjou, was becoming too\r\npowerful to be trusted, he turned to Coligny and the Calvinists, broke\r\noff the alliance concluded with Spain the previous year, and sought to\r\nbring over France to the side of England and of the rebel subjects of\r\nSpain in the Netherlands. Coligny was invited to court, where he soon\r\nbecame the most trusted and influential councillor of the king. He\r\nendeavoured to embitter the mind of Charles IX. against his mother,\r\nagainst the Duke of Anjou and the family of Guise. No effort was\r\nspared by him to bring France into the closest relations with England\r\nand the Netherlands against Spain, and as a sign of the reconciliation\r\nthat had been effected between the court and the Huguenots a marriage\r\nwas arranged between Henry, the Calvinist King of Navarre and Margaret\r\nof Valois, the sister of Charles IX.\r\n\r\nThe Catholics were highly indignant at this sudden change of policy.\r\nMindful of the misfortunes brought upon their country by the Huguenots\r\nand of the losses and cruelties they had suffered at the hands of this\r\nimplacable minority, they resented the domination of Coligny, whom\r\nthey regarded as their most dangerous enemy, and they were embittered\r\nby the thought that the victories they had won at so much cost had\r\nresulted only in their own downfall and in the triumph of their worst\r\nenemies. Catharine de' Medici, the queen-mother, felt more acutely\r\nthan the rest the influence of Coligny. She believed that he was using\r\nhis power to alienate the young king from herself, and to win him from\r\nthe policy she had advocated. She was only waiting an opportunity to\r\nwreak her vengeance on Coligny and the whole Huguenot party, knowing\r\nwell as she did that she could count upon the popular feeling of the\r\nnation to support her.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity came on the occasion of the marriage between the King\r\nof Navarre and Margaret of Valois. The leading Calvinists anxious to\r\ntake part in the ceremony flocked to Paris, where they and their\r\nfollowers paraded the streets armed to the teeth and with the air of\r\nconquerors. Catharine de' Medici took steps to secure the murder of\r\nColigny on the 22nd August, 1572, but the attempt failed. Such a step\r\nserved, however, to embitter feelings on both sides, and to arouse the\r\nqueen-mother to make one final effort for the destruction of her\r\nHuguenot opponents. In an audience with the king she represented to\r\nhim that the Calvinists were plotting to take his life, and that the\r\nonly way to secure himself against them was to anticipate them. In\r\nview of the previous history of the party and the suspicious\r\ntemperament of the king, it required little to convince him of the\r\ntruth of this allegation, and at last he signed an order that on a\r\ncertain pre-arranged signal having been given the soldiers should let\r\nloose on the Huguenots. On the night preceding the feast of St.\r\nBartholomew (23-24 Aug.) the bells of the church of St. Germain-en-\r\nLaye were rung, and the troops sallied forth to carry out their\r\ninstructions. Rumours of a Huguenot plot had been spread through the\r\ncity. The people were alarmed, and the general body of the citizens\r\ntook up arms to support the soldiers. In the melee that followed over\r\na thousand Calvinists including Coligny were put to death. The\r\nmovement spread through the provinces where about the same number\r\nsuffered as in the capital, though many of the Catholic clergy, as for\r\nexample, the Bishop of Lisieux, exerted themselves to put an end to\r\nthe butchery.\r\n\r\nThis event is known in history as the massacre of St. Bartholomew. The\r\nmassacre was in no sense a premeditated affair. It was a sudden\r\noutburst of popular indignation brought about by the machinations of\r\nthe queen-mother, and was neither encouraged nor approved by the\r\nbishops of the Catholic Church. The king presented himself before the\r\nParliament of Paris on the day following the massacre, and declared\r\nthat he alone was responsible for what had happened. He explained that\r\na plot had been formed against his life and that he had taken the only\r\nmeasures that it was possible for him to take. This was the account of\r\nthe affair that was forwarded to the French diplomatic representatives\r\nabroad, and which they gave at all courts to which they were\r\naccredited. Gregory XIII., acting on the report of the French\r\nambassador, ordered that a /Te Deum/ should be sung in thanksgiving\r\nfor the safety of the king and royal family, and not, as has been so\r\noften alleged, as a sign of rejoicing for the murder of the\r\nCalvinists. On the contrary he was deeply pained when he learned the\r\ntrue state of affairs. The massacre of St. Bartholomew was indeed\r\nunjustifiable, but it was done neither to promote religion nor at the\r\ninstigation of the Church. It was merely political in its object as\r\nfar as the king and the queen-mother were concerned, and it was a\r\nsudden popular outburst in so far as the citizens of Paris or the\r\npeople of the country took part in it. In judging the responsibility\r\nand blame for what took place nobody can put out of mind the terrible\r\nexcesses, of which the Huguenots had been guilty during their long\r\nstruggle against their own countrymen. The German Lutherans, who\r\nlooked upon the slaughter as a judgment from Heaven on the Calvinist\r\nheretics, were rejoiced at their execution.[8]\r\n\r\nThe Huguenots flew to arms to avenge their brethren who had fallen,\r\nand the fourth civil war began. The Duke of Anjou laid siege to their\r\nstrongest fortress, La Rochelle, but failed to take it, and on his\r\nelection as King of Poland (1573) a treaty was concluded according to\r\nwhich the Huguenots were allowed free exercise of their religion. A\r\nlarge number of French politicians were at last growing tired of a\r\nstruggle which was costing their country so dearly, and were anxious\r\nto conclude peace even though it were necessary to yield to the\r\ndemands of the Huguenots. At the head of this party stood some of the\r\nmost powerful nobles of France including the Duc d'Alencon, and when\r\non the death of Charles IX. the Duke of Anjou succeeded as Henry III.\r\n(1575-89) his sympathies were entirely with the party of the moderates\r\nas against the extremists of both sides. By the terms of the Peace of\r\nBeaulieu (1576) the Huguenots were assured of complete freedom except\r\nin Paris and at the French Court, and of full civil rights, and as a\r\nguarantee of good faith they were continued in possession of their\r\nfortresses.\r\n\r\nIndignant at such concessions the Catholic party formed the League[9]\r\nwith the young Duke of Guise at its head. Henry III., finding that it\r\nwas impossible to oppose this combination with any hope of success,\r\ndetermined to control it by becoming himself its leader. The\r\nconcessions made to the Huguenots were recalled (1577), and the fifth\r\ncivil war broke out. This was brought to an end by the Peace of\r\nPoitiers (1577). The Huguenot party, under the King of Navarre and the\r\nyoung Prince de Conde, continued to make headway against the League,\r\nand sought to strengthen themselves by an alliance with England and\r\nthe Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThe question of the succession to the French throne became serious for\r\nboth parties. Henry III. was childless, and on the death of the heir-\r\napparent, his brother the Duke of Anjou (Alencon, 1584), the\r\nsuccession devolved apparently on Henry King of Navarre, but as he was\r\na Calvinist the Catholics were unwilling to recognise him. The League\r\ndeclared Cardinal de Bourbon son of the Duke of Vendome as the lawful\r\nheir to the French throne, though many of its out and out supporters\r\nwere in favour of the Duke of Guise. An attempt was made to get the\r\napproval of the Pope for the League and its policy, but both George\r\nXIII. and Sixtus V. were not inclined to support its pretensions. At\r\nthe earnest request of Spain the latter, however, issued a\r\nconstitution in 1585, by which he declared that Henry of Navarre and\r\nthe Prince de Conde, as notorious heretics excommunicated by the\r\nChurch, had forfeited all claim to the throne of France. Henry of\r\nNavarre lodged a solemn protest in Rome, and he appealed to the\r\nParliament of Paris, which refused to approve of the publication of\r\nthe papal document. Both sides had recourse once more to arms, and the\r\nHuguenots under the leadership of Henry of Navarre were victorious in\r\nthe battle of Coutras (1587). The League however continued the\r\nstruggle, captured some of the principal cities such as Lyons,\r\nOrleans, and Bourges, while Henry III. favoured both parties in turn.\r\nOverawed by the successful exploits of the Duke of Guise he pledged\r\nhimself to put down the Huguenots, and the French people were called\r\nupon by royal proclamation to swear that they would never accept a\r\nheretic as their king (1588).\r\n\r\nBut in his heart Henry III. favoured the cause of the King of Navarre,\r\nif for no other reason because he wished to escape from the\r\ndictatorship of the Duke of Guise. In 1588 he procured the murder of\r\nthe two greatest leaders of the League, Henry Duke of Guise and his\r\nbrother Louis the Cardinal-archbishop of Lyons. This outrage drew upon\r\nhim the wrath of the League and of the great body of the French\r\nCatholics. Charles de Lorraine, brother of the murdered Duke of Guise,\r\nput himself at the head of the king's enemies. Sixtus V. issued a\r\nstrong condemnation of the murder of the cardinal-archbishop, and the\r\nSorbonne declared that the nation no longer owed any allegiance to the\r\nking. The war was renewed vigorously on both sides, the League being\r\nsupported by Philip II. of Spain and its opponents by Protestant\r\ntroops from Germany and Switzerland. While the combined forces of\r\nHenry III. and of the King of Navarre were besieging Paris, Henry III.\r\nwas assassinated (1589).\r\n\r\nThereupon Henry of Navarre had himself proclaimed King of France under\r\nthe title of Henry IV., but the League refused to recognise his claims\r\nand put forward instead the aged Cardinal de Bourbon, then a prisoner\r\nin the hands of the King of Navarre. The Cardinal also was proclaimed\r\nking (Charles X.). Spain, too, refused to acknowledge Henry IV., and\r\nassisted the League with both money and soldiers. The Popes, Sixtus V.\r\nGregory VIX. and Clement VIII. adopted an attitude of great reserve.\r\nWhile they were not inclined to support the demands of the League in\r\ntheir entirety they were unshaken in their reserve to acknowledge no\r\nheretic as king of France. Henry IV., though supported by many of the\r\nmoderate Catholics (/Les Politiques/), began to recognise that as a\r\nCalvinist he could never hope for peaceful possession of the French\r\nthrone. He determined, therefore, to yield to the entreaties of his\r\nmost powerful supporters and to make his submission to the Catholic\r\nChurch. In July 1593 he read a public recantation in the Church of St.\r\nDenis, and was absolved conditionally from the censures he had\r\nincurred. The following year he made his formal entrance into Paris,\r\nwhere he was welcomed by the people, and acknowledged as lawful king\r\nof France by the Sorbonne. Having pledged himself to accept the\r\ndecrees of the Council of Trent, to abide by the terms of the\r\nConcordat of 1516, and to rear his heir and successor as a Catholic he\r\nwas reconciled to the Holy See. The League dissolved itself in a short\r\ntime, and so far as Catholics were concerned peace was restored to\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe Huguenots, Henry IV.'s former co-religionists, were deeply pained\r\nat the step taken by their leader, and they insisted that their\r\ndemands must be satisfied. Henry IV., more anxious for the unity and\r\nwelfare of France than for the triumph of either religious party,\r\ndetermined to put an end to the civil strife by the publication of the\r\nEdict of Nantes (1598). The principal articles of the Edict were that\r\nthe Calvinists should enjoy freedom of worship throughout the greater\r\npart of the kingdom, that they should be eligible for all positions of\r\nhonour and trust in the state, that they should have for their own use\r\nthe Universities of Montauban, Montpelier, Sedan, and Samur, that the\r\nfunds for the upkeep of these universities and for the maintenance of\r\ntheir religion should be supplied by the state, and that for a period\r\nof eight years they should have possession of some of the principal\r\nfortresses. On their side they engaged to break off all alliances with\r\nforeigners, to allow Catholic worship to be restored in the places\r\nwhere it had been suppressed, to observe the marriage laws of the\r\nCatholic Church, and to abstain from anything that might be regarded\r\nas a violation of Catholic holidays. Such concessions were regarded\r\nwith great disfavour by the Pope, the clergy, and the vast majority of\r\nthe French people as being opposed to the entire national tradition of\r\nFrance, and it required all the efforts of the king to secure for them\r\nthe approval of the Paris Parliament (1599). Similarly the Calvinists\r\nwere not content with what had been conceded to them, nor were they\r\nwilling to abide by the terms of the Edict of Nantes in so far as to\r\nallow the establishment of Catholic worship in the places which were\r\nunder their control. Their public attacks on the Blessed Eucharist and\r\non the Pope were very irritating to their countrymen, but Henry IV.,\r\nwho was a good king deeply interested especially in the welfare of the\r\nlower classes, continued to keep the peace between both parties. His\r\nsympathies were, however, with the Protestants of Germany, and he was\r\nactually on his way to take part in a war against the Emperor when he\r\nwas assassinated (1610).\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by his son Louis XIII. (1610-43) who was then a boy\r\nof nine years. His mother Mary de' Medici, who acted as regent\r\napproved the terms of the Edict of Nantes, but the Huguenots relying\r\non the weakness of the government refused to carry out those portions\r\nof the Edict favourable to Catholics, and made demands for greater\r\nprivileges. They rose in rebellion several times especially in the\r\nSouth, entered into alliance with every rebel noble who took up arms\r\nagainst the king, and acted generally as if they formed a state within\r\na state. Cardinal Richelieu who was for years the actual ruler of\r\nFrance (1624-42),[10] inspired solely by political motives, determined\r\nto put an end to a condition of affairs that was highly dangerous to\r\nthe strength and national unity of the kingdom. He saw that it was\r\nimpossible for France to extend her power so long as there existed at\r\nhome a well-organised body of citizens prepared to enter into\r\ntreasonable relations with foreign enemies, and to turn to their own\r\nadvantage their country's difficulties. His opportunity came when the\r\nHuguenots having concluded an alliance with England rose in rebellion\r\n(1627). He laid siege to their strongest fortress, La Rochelle, drove\r\nback the fleet which England sent to their assistance, and compelled\r\nthe city to surrender (1628). By this strong measure he put an end to\r\nthe power of the Huguenots in France and secured peace and unity for\r\nthe country, while at the same time he treated the conquered with\r\ncomparative mildness, confirming the Edict of Nantes (Edict of Nimes,\r\n1629), proclaiming a general amnesty, and restoring the leaders of the\r\nrebellion to the property and positions they had forfeited.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Louis XIV. (1643-1715) the whole tendency of the\r\ngovernment was dangerous to the Huguenots. Louis XIV. was determined\r\nto make himself absolute ruler of France, and, therefore, he could\r\nregard only with the highest disfavour the presence in his territories\r\nof a well-organised privileged party like the Huguenots. An\r\nopportunity of carrying out his designs came in 1659, when with the\r\napproval of the Synod of Montpazier they attempted to negotiate an\r\nalliance with England. They were punished with great severity,\r\nforbidden to preach in any place without express permission, to attack\r\nCatholic doctrines publicly, or to intermarry with Catholics. Converts\r\nfrom Calvinism were encouraged by promises of special concessions.\r\nOwing to the disfavour of the king and the energetic action of the\r\nclergy and bishops, whose education and culture at that time stood\r\nexceedingly high, large numbers of the Huguenots returned to the\r\nChurch so that in some places, as for example in Normandy, where once\r\nthey could boast of considerable influence, the sect became almost\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\nThe severity of the measures taken by Louis XIV. led to new\r\nrebellions, which were suppressed with great severity. Finally in 1685\r\na royal proclamation appeared announcing the revocation of all the\r\nprivileges granted to the Huguenots and more particularly all those\r\ncontained in the Edict of Nantes (1685). The churches which they had\r\nbuilt recently were to be destroyed, their religious assembles were\r\nforbidden, and their clergy were offered their choice between\r\nsubmission to the Church or exile. The prime minister Louvois sent\r\nsoldiers to enforce this proclamation, and the unfortunate Huguenots\r\nwere treated with great harshness and cruelty. Many of them, unwilling\r\nto change their religion and unable to endure their hard lot at home,\r\nleft the country and sought refuge in England, Germany, Denmark, and\r\nHolland. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes was not due to the\r\nreligious zeal of Louis XIV. or of his ministers. Indeed at the very\r\ntime that Louis XIV. was engaged in dragooning the Huguenots into the\r\nCatholic Church he was in bitter conflict with the Pope, and was\r\ncommitted to a policy that seemed destined to end in national schism.\r\nSome of the French bishops, notably Fenelon, disapproved of this\r\nattempt at conversion by violence, and Pope Innocent XI., having no\r\nrepresentative in Paris at the time, instructed his nuncio at London\r\nto induce James II. of England to bring pressure to bear on Louis XIV.\r\nto favour the Huguenots.[11] Several times during the reign of Louis\r\nthe Calvinists rose in arms to defend their religion but without\r\neffect. After his death the decrees against them were not enforced\r\nwith much severity, but it was only in 1787 that a measure of almost\r\ncomplete political equality was granted to them by Louis XVI.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] Lefranc, /Les idees religieuses de Marguerite de Navarre/, 1898.\r\n\r\n[2] Thomas, /Le Concordat de 1516/, 3 vols., 1910.\r\n\r\n[3] Forneron, /Les Ducs de Guise/, 1877.\r\n\r\n[4] De Ruble, /Antoine de Bourbon/, 2 vols., 1881-2.\r\n\r\n[5] Marcks, /Gaspard von Coligny/, 1892.

For many reasons it was not to be wondered at that the\r\npeople should sympathise with the great religious revolt in Germany.\r\nThey were allied closely with the Germans by blood and language. Like\r\nthem, too, they looked upon Spain and upon the Spaniards with feelings\r\nof distrust. Again, as in other parts of the world, so too in the\r\nNetherlands the wealth of the Church had led to grave abuses as well\r\nas to a loss of respect for ecclesiastical authority, the latter of\r\nwhich was fostered in the minds of some by the spirit of mysticism\r\nthat flourished in the land of St. Thomas a Kempis.\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding these favourable circumstances, the Reformation\r\nmade little progress in the Netherlands during the reign of Charles V.\r\nHe was a man who understood the people and who respected their rights\r\nand privileges. He visited the country frequently, was always ready to\r\nlisten to their demands, and he took care not to offend their national\r\ninstincts by a display of Spanish troops or Spanish officials.\r\nBesides, having a freer hand to deal with the new religious movement\r\nin the Netherlands than he had in Germany, he was determined to\r\npreserve his hereditary dominions from the dimensions and civil strife\r\nthat had done so much to weaken the empire. He insisted on the\r\nproclamation and execution of the decree of the Diet of Worms against\r\nLuther, forbade the spread of heretical writings, introduced the\r\nInquisition, and punished with great severity those who were found\r\nguilty of attempting to tamper with the faith of the people. But\r\ndespite his efforts the trouble that had broken out in the\r\nneighbouring countries, France and Germany, could not fail to find an\r\necho in the Netherlands, and the views of Calvin and Luther found some\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nIn 1555 Charles retired and was succeeded by his son Philip II. (1555-\r\n98). The new ruler unlike his father made no effort to win the\r\naffections of his subjects in the Netherlands, or to attach them to\r\nhimself by bonds of loyalty. On the contrary he came amongst them only\r\ntoo seldom, and after 1559 he never set foot in the country. He showed\r\nhimself careless about their commercial interests, regardless of their\r\nconstitutional rights and privileges, and indifferent to their\r\nnational prepossessions. Instead of relying on the native officials\r\nand nobles to carry on the administration of the kingdom, he sought to\r\nstrengthen his own power by appointing Spaniards to offices of trust\r\nand by sending Spanish troops to suppress all symptoms of discontent.\r\nHe set aside the Grand Council which by custom had the rights of a\r\nparliament, and without consultation with the authorities in the\r\nNetherlands he decided upon a new ecclesiastical division of the\r\ncountry. Hitherto there were only four bishops, whose Sees were\r\nsubject to foreign metropolitans. Philip decided that the time had\r\ncome when the number of bishoprics should be increased, and the\r\njurisdiction of foreign metropolitans should be abolished. The main\r\nreason that influenced him to adopt this decision was the fact that,\r\nas matters stood, a complete and far-reaching scheme of reform could\r\nnot be put into operation. In conjunction with Pope Paul IV. he\r\narranged (1559) that the Spanish Netherlands should be placed under\r\nthe three newly-erected archiepiscopal Sees of Utrecht, Cambrai, and\r\nMechlin, and that suitable provision should be made for the\r\nmaintenance of the new bishops out of the possessions of the\r\nmonasteries and of the ecclesiastical institutions as well as from the\r\ncontributions of the laity.\r\n\r\nMany of the nobles were already tired of the Spanish rule, and were\r\nnot unwilling to look favourably on the religious struggle as a means\r\nof securing independence. They objected to several unconstitutional\r\nacts of which the government of Philip II. had been guilty. They\r\ndisliked Cardinal de Granvelle, the prime minister in the Netherlands,\r\nand insisted on his recall. They objected to the introduction of the\r\nInquisition, and they protested against the new diocesan division as\r\nunnecessary, burdensome to the country, and an infringement of the\r\nrights and privileges of certain individuals. The clergy and people,\r\nwhose positions were affected by the new arrangement, supported them\r\nstrongly in their opposition to this measure. The leaders of this\r\nmovement were the Count of Egmont and William of Orange,[1] the latter\r\nof whom was a clever politician of boundless ambitions, who was not\r\nwithout hope that a rebellion against Spain might be the means of\r\nsecuring supreme power in the Netherlands. His brother, the Prince of\r\nNassau, had adopted Calvinism, and William himself was not troubled\r\nwith any particularly strong religious convictions. By his marriage\r\nwith the daughter of Maurice of Saxony he sought to assure himself of\r\nthe support of the German Protestant princes, while at the same time\r\nhe was intimately connected with the Huguenots of France, and was on\r\nterms of the closest friendship with Counts Egmont and Horn, both of\r\nthem, though for different reasons, hostile to Philip II. For William\r\nand for many of his abettors religion was but a secondary issue,\r\nprovided only that by means of a religious revolution the power of\r\nSpain could be overthrown. Cardinal Granvelle, the minister of the\r\nDuchess of Parma,[2] who was then regent of the country, was a strong\r\nman and a dangerous opponent, for whose removal the party of William\r\nof Orange strove with all their might. They succeeded at last in 1564,\r\nbut despite all their efforts they could not prevent the publication\r\nof the decrees of the Council of Trent. They met together in the\r\nfollowing year (1565) and formed the union known as the Compromise of\r\nBreda, nominally for the preservation of their constitutional rights\r\nbut in reality to promote a political and religious rebellion. Many\r\nearnest Catholics unaware of the motives that inspired the leaders of\r\nthis movement lent them their support. Having strengthened themselves\r\nby negotiations with some of the Protestant princes of Germany, the\r\nrevolutionary party presented themselves before Margaret of Parma at\r\nBrussels to demand redress (1566). During the course of the interview\r\nCount de Berlaymont referred to them as a crowd of \"gueux\" or beggars,\r\nand this was the name they adopted to designate their party (/Les\r\nGueux/).\r\n\r\nThough they professed themselves willing to maintain the Catholic\r\nreligion the friends of William of Orange had strong leanings towards\r\nProtestantism. Calvinist preachers flocked in from France; Calvinist\r\ncommunities began to be formed; and in districts where the party found\r\nitself powerful enough to do so, attacks were made on Catholic\r\nchurches and Catholic worship. These outrages served to indicate the\r\nreal tendency of the movement, and to drive into the opposite camp\r\nmany Catholics who had joined the party merely to secure redress of\r\npolitical grievances. The Duchess of Parma, having failed to put an\r\nend to the disturbances by friendly negotiations, determined to employ\r\nforce against the rebels. She was completely successful. William of\r\nOrange fled to Germany, and Counts Egmont and Horn surrendered\r\nthemselves to the mercy of the king (1567). Had Philip II. known how\r\nto take advantage of this victory he might have put an end to\r\nCalvinism in the Netherlands, for as yet the vast majority of the\r\ninhabitants were at heart loyal to the Catholic church.\r\n\r\nBut instead of coming to make a personal appeal for the allegiance of\r\nhis subjects and of trying to win over the malcontents by a policy of\r\nmoderation Philip II., more concerned for the suppression of heresy\r\nthan for the maintenance of Spanish rule, sent the Duke of Alva[3]\r\n(1567-72) with an army of ten thousand men to punish the offenders and\r\nto wipe out all traces of Calvinism. Alva was a soldier who had\r\ndistinguished himself on many a field against the Turks and against\r\nFrance. His character is sufficiently indicated by the title \"the iron\r\nduke\" given him by those who knew him best. He had no faith in\r\ndiplomacy or concession. For him martial law was the only means of\r\nreducing rebels to subjection. The Duchess of Parma, unwilling to\r\nshare the responsibility of government with such an associate,\r\npetitioned for her recall, and the Duke of Alva was appointed regent\r\nof the Netherlands. Two leaders of the rebellion, Counts Egmont and\r\nHorn, were tried and put to death (1568), as were also many of their\r\nfollowers. The goods of the rebels were confiscated, soldiers were\r\nquartered on the districts which were supposed to be sympathetic with\r\nthe movement, and martial law became the order of the day. But the\r\ncruel measures adopted by the Duke of Alva did not put an end to the\r\nrebellion in the Netherlands. On the contrary, the contempt shown by\r\nhim for the constitution of the country and the rights of individual\r\ncitizens, the excessive taxation, and the license given to the\r\nsoldiers in their treatment of civilians served only to embitter the\r\nissue and to drive even moderate men into the path of rebellion.\r\nWilliam of Orange, backed by his brother, Louis of Nassau, made\r\ndescents upon the country, while vessels manned by their supporters\r\nset themselves to do as much harm as possible to Spanish trade. With\r\nthe aid of England they managed to capture the city and port of Briel\r\n(1572). Several of the northern states threw off the yoke of Spain and\r\nacknowledged William of Orange as their ruler, so that in a short time\r\nthe Provinces of Holland and Zeeland were practically lost to Philip\r\nII. William of Orange tried to obscure the religious nature of the\r\ncampaign by proclaiming religious freedom, but his followers could not\r\nbe restrained. The Catholic churches were attacked, the clergy were\r\nexpelled, and in 1572 nineteen priests were martyred for the faith at\r\nGorcum. Holland and Zeeland went over completely to Calvinism, nor\r\nwere the southern provinces, which were still Catholic, contented with\r\nthe rule of Alva. Driven to desperation by his taxation and\r\nunconstitutional policy they formed a league with the followers of\r\nWilliam of Orange to put an end to Spanish rule in the Netherlands.\r\nPhilip II. began to realise that he had been unfortunate in his\r\nselection of a governor. A deputation that was sent from the\r\ninsurgents was received kindly, and Alva's resignation of his office\r\nwas accepted.\r\n\r\nIn his place Don Louis Requesens was sent as governor of the\r\nNetherlands (1573-5). Though inferior to Alva in military skill he was\r\nmuch superior to him in the arts of diplomacy and conciliation. He\r\nwithdrew promptly the financial decrees that had caused such general\r\ndiscontent, yielded to most of the demands made by the people, and\r\noffered a general amnesty to those who would return to their\r\nallegiance. It required all the skill of William of Orange to prevent\r\nthe submission of his adherents. Disappointed by the removal of the\r\ngrievances that had provoked a national uprising, he was forced to\r\nhave recourse more and more to the religious issues in order to\r\nmaintain his power. He proclaimed himself the protector and champion\r\nof Calvinism, and as such he could still count on the aid of the\r\nnorthern provinces. Unfortunately, too, at the very time when the\r\nsuccess of his policy of mildness seemed assured, Requesens died\r\nleaving it to his successor to complete his work.\r\n\r\nDon Juan of Austria, the natural son of Charles V., who had won renown\r\nthroughout the world by his annihilation of the Turkish fleet at\r\nLepanto, was appointed in his place. Before his arrival the southern\r\nand northern provinces had bound themselves together in the\r\nPacification of Ghent (1576). Don Juan was obliged to accept the terms\r\nof the Pacification and to dismiss the Spanish troops before his\r\nauthority would be recognised. William of Orange, secure in the north,\r\ndetermined to occupy the southern provinces, but his public profession\r\nof Calvinism and the religious intolerance of his followers prevented\r\na combined national effort. The Catholic nobles of the Walloon\r\nprovinces objected to the Protestant campaign that was being carried\r\non in the name of liberty, and showed themselves not unwilling to come\r\nto terms with Don Juan. The latter, only too glad to meet them half-\r\nway, issued a very conciliatory decree (1577), which secured him the\r\nsupport of many of the Catholic party, and partly by force, partly by\r\nnegotiation he succeeded in winning back much of what had been lost.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Don Juan (1578) Alexander Farnese, son of the former\r\nregent Margaret of Parma, was appointed his successor. Being something\r\nof a statesman as well as a soldier he lost no opportunity of\r\nendeavouring to break the power of the Prince of Orange. He devoted a\r\ngreat deal of his energies to the work of detaching the southern\r\nprovinces, which still remained Catholic, from the northern, which had\r\ngone over to Calvinism. The intolerance of the Calvinists and their\r\nopen violation of the religious freedom guaranteed to all parties\r\ntended to the success of his plans. During his term of office Belgium\r\nreturned its allegiance to Spain, and this step put an end to the\r\nhopes entertained by the Calvinists of winning that country to their\r\nside. Meanwhile the northern provinces were entirely in the hands of\r\nWilliam of Orange. In 1579 the five provinces Holland, Zeeland,\r\nFriesland, Geldern, and Zutphen bound themselves together by a solemn\r\ncompact in the Union of Utrecht under the name of the United\r\nProvinces, and practically speaking established a Dutch republic. They\r\nagreed to make common cause in war and in peace, and appointed William\r\nof Orange as Stadtholder for life. A short time later (1581) William\r\nof Orange, notwithstanding all his proclamations regarding religious\r\nliberty, forbade the public exercise of the Catholic religion, and\r\nrefused to allow the new Archbishop of Utrecht to take possession of\r\nhis See. In these circumstances nothing remained for the Pope except\r\nto appoint a vicar-apostolic to take charge of the religious interests\r\nof the Catholics, who formed two-fifths of the population of Holland,\r\nbut even the vicar-apostolic was soon banished from the country.\r\n\r\nIn 1584 William of Orange was assassinated, and his son Maurice was\r\nappointed to succeed him. The English Government anxious to strike a\r\nblow at Spain encouraged the Dutch to continue the war, and despatched\r\ntroops to their assistance. After the defeat of the Spanish Armada the\r\nsituation was much more favourable to the rebels, and at last in 1609\r\na twelve years' truce was concluded. On the expiration of the truce\r\nthe war was renewed without any very striking success on either side.\r\nFinally in the Peace of Westphalia (1648) the independence of the\r\nDutch republic was acknowledged by Spain. From the very beginning of\r\nthe religious revolt in the Netherlands Calvinism was the sect most\r\nfavoured by the people, as is evidenced by the /Confessio Belgica/ in\r\n1562. The University of Leyden decided in its favour, as did also the\r\nSynods of Dordrecht in 1574 and 1618. The Catholic minority in Holland\r\nwere treated with the greatest severity, but in spite of all the\r\nefforts to induce them to change their faith many of the districts\r\nremained completely Catholic.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic provinces, which remained true to Spain and to the\r\nCatholic Church, suffered very severely from the long-drawn-out\r\nstruggle, but despite the ravages of war they were soon the centre of\r\na great religious, literary and artistic revival. The University of\r\nLouvain, founded in 1425, developed rapidly under the generous\r\npatronage of the civil rulers. During the sixteenth century it was\r\nrecognised as an important centre of learning whither scholars flocked\r\nnot merely from the Low Countries but from all parts of Europe.\r\nThroughout the Reformation struggle Louvain and Douay, the latter of\r\nwhich was founded in 1562 by Philip II. to assist in stemming the\r\nrising tide of Calvinism, remained staunch defenders of Catholic\r\northodoxy, though the unfortunate controversies waged round the\r\ndoctrines of Baius and Jansenius did something to dim the glory of the\r\nuniversity to which both belonged. The Jesuits, too, rendered\r\ninvaluable service to religion and learning, particularly the men who\r\nhastened to offer their services to Father van Bolland in his famous\r\n/Acta Sanctorum/. Nor can it be forgotten that it was in these days\r\nCatholic Belgium gave to the world the great Flemish school of\r\nartists, amongst whom must be reckoned such men as Rubens, Van Dyck,\r\nand Jordaens.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] Lacheret, /L'evolution religieuse de Guillaume le Taciturne/,\r\n    1904.\r\n\r\n[2] Rachfal, /Margareta von Parma/, 1898.\r\n\r\n[3] /Vita Ferdinandi Toletani, ducis Albani/, 1669.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                       THE COUNTER-REFORMATION\r\n\r\nFor more than thirty years the new religious movement continued to\r\nspread with alarming rapidity. Nation after nation either fell away\r\nfrom the centre of unity or wavered as to the attitude that should be\r\nadopted towards the conflicting claims of Rome, Wittenberg, and\r\nGeneva, till at last it seemed not unlikely that Catholicism was to be\r\nconfined within the territorial boundaries of Italy, Spain, and\r\nPortugal. That the world was well prepared for such an outburst has\r\nbeen shown already,[1] but it is necessary to emphasise the fact that\r\nthe real interests of religion played but a secondary part in the\r\nsuccess of the Protestant revolt. Luther, Calvin, Zwingli, and Knox\r\nmay be taken as typical of the new apostles, and however gifted and\r\nenergetic these men may have been, yet few would care to contend that\r\neither in their own lives or in the means to which they had recourse\r\nfor propagating their views they can be regarded as ideal religious\r\nreformers.\r\n\r\nProtestantism owed its success largely to political causes, and\r\nparticularly in the case of Lutheranism to its acknowledgment of the\r\nprinciple of royal supremacy. At its inception it was favoured by the\r\nalmost universal jealousy of the House of Habsburg and by the danger\r\nof a Turkish invasion. If attention be directed to the countries where\r\nit attained its largest measure of success, it will be found that in\r\nGermany this success was due mainly to the distrust of the Emperor\r\nentertained by the princes and their desire to strengthen their own\r\nauthority against both the Emperor and the people; in Switzerland to\r\nthe political aspirations of the populous and manufacturing cantons\r\nand their eagerness to resist the encroachments of the House of Savoy;\r\nin the Scandinavian North to the efforts of ambitious rulers anxious\r\nto free themselves from the restrictions imposed upon their authority\r\nby the nobles and bishops; in the Netherlands to the determination of\r\nthe people to maintain their old laws and constitutions in face of the\r\ndomineering policy of Philip II.; in France to the attitude of the\r\nrulers who disliked the Catholic Church as being the enemy of\r\nabsolutism, and who were willing to maintain friendly relations with\r\nthe German Protestants in the hope of weakening the Empire by civil\r\nwar; in England, at first to the autocratic position of the sovereign,\r\nand later to a feeling of national patriotism that inspired Englishmen\r\nto resent the interference of foreigners in what they regarded as\r\ntheir domestic affairs; and in Scotland to the bitter rivalry of two\r\nfactions one of which favoured an alliance with France, the other, a\r\nunion with England. In all these countries the hope of sharing in the\r\nplunder of the Church had a much greater influence in determining the\r\nattitude of both rulers and nobles than their zeal for reform, as the\r\nleaders of the so-called Reformation had soon good reason to recognise\r\nand to deplore.\r\n\r\nProtestantism had reached the zenith of its power on the Continent in\r\n1555. At that time everything seemed to indicate its permanent\r\nsuccess, but soon under the Providence of God the tide began to turn,\r\nand instead of being able to make further conquests it found it\r\nimpossible to retain those that had been made. The few traces of\r\nheresy that might have been detected in Italy, Spain, and Portugal\r\ndisappeared. France, thanks largely to the energy of the League and\r\nthe political schemes of Cardinal Richelieu, put an end to the\r\nCalvinist domination. Hungary and Poland were wrested to a great\r\nextent from the influence of the Protestant preachers by the labours\r\nof the Jesuits. Belgium was retained for Spain and for Catholicity\r\nmore by the prudence and diplomacy of Farnese than by the violence of\r\nAlva; and in the German Empire the courageous stand made by some of\r\nthe princes, notably Maximilian of Bavaria, delivered Austria,\r\nBohemia, Bavaria and the greater part of Southern Germany from\r\nProtestantism.\r\n\r\nMany causes helped to bring about this striking reaction towards\r\nCatholicism. Amongst the principal of these were the reforms initiated\r\nby the Council of Trent, the rise of zealous ecclesiastics and above\r\nall of zealous popes, the establishment of new religious orders,\r\nespecially the establishment of the Society of Jesus, and finally the\r\ndetermination of some of the Catholic princes to meet force by force.\r\nMention should be made too of the wonderful outburst of missionary\r\nzeal that helped to win over new races and new peoples in the East and\r\nthe West at a time when so many of the favoured nations of Europe had\r\nrenounced or were threatening to renounce their allegiance to the\r\nChurch of Rome.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] Chap.

Earnest men looked forward to this as the sole means of\r\nstemming the tide of neo-paganism that threatened to engulf the\r\nChristian world, while wicked men hoped to find in the movement for\r\nreform an opportunity of wrecking the divine constitution that Christ\r\nhad given to His Church. Popes and Councils had failed hitherto to\r\naccomplish this work. The bishops had met at Constance and Basle, at\r\nFlorence and at Rome (5th Lateran Council), and had parted leaving the\r\nroot of the evil untouched. Notwithstanding all these failures the\r\nfeeling was practically universal that in a General Council lay the\r\nonly hope of reform, and that for one reason or another the Roman\r\nCuria looked with an unfavourable eye on the convocation of such an\r\nassembly. Whether the charge was true or false it was highly\r\nprejudicial to the authority of the Holy See, and as a consequence of\r\nit, when Luther and his followers appealed from the verdict of Leo X.\r\nto the verdict of a General Council, they evoked the open or secret\r\nsympathy of many, who had nothing but contempt for their religious\r\ninnovations. Charles V., believing in the sincerity of their offer to\r\nsubmit themselves to the judgment of such a body, supported strongly\r\nthe idea of a council, as did also the Diets held at Nurnberg in 1523\r\nand 1524.\r\n\r\nThe hesitation of Adrian VI. (1522-3) and of Clement VII. (1523-34) to\r\nyield to these demands was due neither to their inability to\r\nappreciate the magnitude of the abuses nor of their desire to oppose\r\nany and every proposal of reform. The disturbed condition of the\r\ntimes, when so many individuals had fallen away from the faith and\r\nwhen whole nations formerly noted for their loyalty to the Pope\r\nthreatened to follow in their footsteps, made it difficult to decide\r\nwhether the suggested remedy might not prove worse than the disease.\r\nThe memory, too, of the scenes that took place at Constance and Basle\r\nand of the revolutionary proposals put forward in these assemblies,\r\nmade the Popes less anxious to try a similar experiment with the\r\npossibility of even worse results, particularly at a time when the\r\nunfriendly relations existing between the Empire, France, and England\r\nheld out but little hope for the success of a General Council. As\r\nevents showed the delay was providential. It afforded an opportunity\r\nfor excitement and passion to die away; it helped to secure moderation\r\nin the views both of the radical and conservative elements in the\r\nChurch; and it allowed the issues in dispute to shape themselves more\r\nclearly and to be narrowed down to their true proportions, thereby\r\nenabling the Catholic theologians to formulate precisely the doctrines\r\nof the Church in opposition to the opinions of the Lutherans.\r\n\r\nClement VII. (1523-34), one of the de' Medici family, succeeded to the\r\nPapacy at a most critical period in the civil and religious history of\r\nEurope. The time that he spent at the court of his cousin, Leo X., and\r\nthe traditions of his family and of his native city of Florence made\r\nit almost impossible for him to throw himself into the work of reform\r\nor to adopt the stern measures that the situation demanded. Instead of\r\nallying himself closely with Charles V. or Francis I. of France, or\r\nbetter still of preserving an attitude of strict neutrality towards\r\nboth, he adopted a policy of vacillation joining now one side now the\r\nother, until the terrible sack of Rome by the infuriated and half-\r\nsavage soldiery of Germany forced him to conclude an agreement with\r\nthe Emperor. During the earlier years of Clement VII.'s reign the\r\nGerman people, Catholic as well as Lutheran, demanded the convocation\r\nof a general or at least a national council, and their demands met\r\nwith the approval of Charles V. The naturally indolent temperament of\r\nthe Pope, the fear that the eagerness for reform might develop into a\r\nviolent revolution, and the danger that a council dominated by the\r\nEmperor might be as distasteful to France and England as dangerous to\r\nthe rights and prerogatives of the Holy See, made him more willing to\r\naccept the counsels of those who suggested delay. When peace was at\r\nlast concluded between the Pope and the Emperor (1529) Charles V. had\r\nchanged his mind about the advisability of a General Council, having\r\nconvinced himself in the meantime that more could be done for the\r\ncause of peace in his territories by private negotiations between the\r\ndifferent parties.\r\n\r\nIt was only on the accession of Paul III. (1534-49) that a really\r\nvigorous effort was made to undertake the work of reform. The new\r\nPope, a member of the Farnese family, was himself a brilliant\r\nHumanist, a patron of literature and art, well known for his strict\r\nand exemplary life as a priest, and deservedly popular both with the\r\nclergy and people of Rome. His one outstanding weakness was his\r\npartiality towards his own relatives, on many of whom he conferred\r\nhigh positions both in church and state. In justice to him it should\r\nbe said, however, that the position of affairs in Rome and in Italy\r\nmade such action less reprehensible than it might seem at first sight,\r\nand that he dealt severely with some of them, as for example, the Duke\r\nof Parma and Piacenza, once he discovered that they were unworthy of\r\nthe confidence that had been reposed in them. He signalised his\r\npontificate by the stern measures he took for the reform of the Roman\r\nCuria, by the appointment of learned and progressive ecclesiastics\r\nlike Reginald Pole, Sadoleto, Caraffa, and Contarini to the college of\r\ncardinals, and by the establishment of special tribunals to combat\r\nheresy.\r\n\r\nAfter a preliminary agreement with the Emperor, Paul III. convoked the\r\nGeneral Council to meet at Mantua in 1537; but the refusal of the\r\nLutheran princes to send representatives, the prohibition issued by\r\nFrancis I. against the attendance of French bishops, and the\r\nunwillingness of the Duke of Mantua to make the necessary arrangements\r\nfor such an assembly in his territory unless under impossible\r\nconditions, made it necessary to prorogue the council to Vicenza in\r\n1538. As hardly any bishops had arrived at the time appointed it was\r\nadjourned at first, and later on prorogued indefinitely. Negotiations\r\nwere, however, continued regarding the place of assembly. The Pope was\r\nanxious that the council should be held in an Italian city, while\r\nCharles V., believing that the Lutherans would never consent to go to\r\nItaly or to accept the decrees of an Italian assembly, insisted that a\r\nGerman city should be selected. In the end as a compromise Trent was\r\nagreed upon by both parties, and the council was convoked once more to\r\nmeet there in 1542. The refusal of the Lutherans to take part in the\r\nproposed council, the unwillingness of Francis I. to permit any of his\r\nsubjects to be present, and the threatened war between France and the\r\nEmpire, made it impossible for the council to meet. Finally, on the\r\nconclusion of the Peace of Crepy (1544), which put an end to the war\r\nwith France, the council was convoked to meet at Trent in March 1545,\r\nand Cardinals del Monte, Reginald Pole, and Marcello Cervini were\r\nappointed to represent the Pope. When the day fixed for the opening\r\nceremony arrived, a further adjournment was rendered imperative owing\r\nto the very sparse attendance of bishops. The First Session was held\r\non the 13th December 1545, and the second in January 1546. There were\r\nthen present in addition to the legates and theologians only four\r\narchbishops, twenty-one bishops, and five generals of religious\r\norders.\r\n\r\nThese two preliminary sessions were given over almost entirely to a\r\ndiscussion of the procedure that should be followed. In the end it was\r\nagreed that the legates should propose to the council the questions on\r\nwhich a decision should be given, that these questions should be\r\nexamined by committees of bishops aided by theologians and jurists,\r\nthat the results of these discussions should be brought before a full\r\ncongregation of the bishops, and that when a decision had been agreed\r\nto the formal decrees should be promulgated in a public session. The\r\nnovel method of voting by nations, introduced for the first time at\r\nConstance and Basle, was rejected in favour of individual voting, a\r\ndefinitive vote being allowed only to bishops, generals of religious\r\norders and abbots (one vote to every three abbots). Procurators of\r\nabsent bishops were not allowed to vote, though later on a special\r\nconcession was made in favour of some German bishops detained at home\r\nby the serious religious condition of their dioceses. The legates were\r\nanxious that the dogmatic issues raised by the Lutherans should be\r\ndealt with at once, while the Emperor was strongly in favour of\r\nbeginning with a comprehensive scheme of reform. By this time he had\r\nmade up his mind to put down his opponents in Germany by force of\r\narms, and he believed that if nothing were done in the meantime to\r\nwiden the breach the defeat of the Lutheran princes might make them\r\nmore willing to take part in the council. As a compromise it was\r\nagreed that doctrine and discipline should be discussed\r\nsimultaneously, and, hence, at most of the public sessions two decrees\r\nwere published, one on matters of faith, the other on reform (/De\r\nReformatione/).\r\n\r\nIt was only at the 4th public session (8th April 1546) that the first\r\ndoctrinal decree could be issued. Since the Lutherans had called in\r\nquestion the value of Tradition as a source of divine revelation, and\r\nhad denied the canonicity of several books accepted hitherto as\r\ninspired, it was fitting that the council should begin its work by\r\ndefining that revelation has been handed down by Tradition as well as\r\nby the Scriptures, of which latter God is the author both as regards\r\nthe Old Testament and the New. In accordance with the decrees of\r\nprevious councils a list of the canonical books of the Scriptures was\r\ndrawn up. Furthermore, it was defined that the sacred writings should\r\nnot be interpreted against the meaning attached to them by the Church,\r\nnor against the unanimous consent of the Fathers, that the Vulgate\r\nVersion, a revised edition of which should be published immediately,\r\nis authentic, that is to say, accurate as regards faith and morals,\r\nand that for the future no one was to print, publish, or retain an\r\nedition of the Scriptures unless it had been approved by the local\r\nbishop.\r\n\r\nThe next subject proposed for examination was Original Sin. The\r\nEmperor showed the greatest anxiety to secure a delay, and at a hint\r\nfrom him several of the Spanish bishops tried to postpone a decision\r\nby prolonging the discussions and by raising the question of the\r\nImmaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin. That the Fathers of Trent\r\nwere not opposed to this doctrine is clear enough from the decrees\r\nthey formulated, but the majority of them were of opinion that purely\r\ndomestic controversies among Catholic theologians should be left\r\nuntouched. In the fifth general session (17th June 1546) it was\r\ndefined that by his transgression of the commandment of God the head\r\nof the human race had forfeited the sanctity and justice in which he\r\nhad been created, and had suffered thereby in both soul and body, that\r\nin doing so he had injured not merely himself but all his descendants,\r\nto whom Original Sin is transmitted not by imitation merely but by\r\npropagation, that the effects of this sin are removed by the sacrament\r\nof Baptism, necessary alike for adults and infants, and that the\r\nconcupiscence, which still remains in a man even after baptism has\r\nproduced its effects, is not in itself sinful. It was declared,\r\nfurthermore, that in the decrees regarding the universality of\r\nOriginal Sin it was not intended to include the Blessed Virgin or to\r\nweaken the binding force of the decrees issued by Sixtus IV. regarding\r\nher Immaculate Conception.\r\n\r\nThe way was now cleared for the question of Justification.[1] This was\r\nthe doctrine on which Luther first found himself in disagreement with\r\nthe Church, and which he put forward in his sermons as the foundation\r\nof his new gospel. The importance of the subject both in itself and in\r\nthe circumstances of the time cannot be exaggerated, nor can it be\r\ncontended that the Fathers at Trent failed to realise their\r\nresponsibilities or to give it the attention it deserved. Had they\r\ndone nothing else except to give to the world such a complete and\r\nluminous exposition of the Catholic teaching on Justification their\r\nmeeting would not have been held in vain. In the 6th public session\r\n(13th January 1547), at which there were present besides the legates,\r\nten archbishops, forty-two bishops, two procurators, five generals of\r\nreligious orders, two abbots and forty-three theologians, it was\r\ndefined that, though by the sin of Adam man had lost original justice\r\nand had suffered much, he still retained free-will, that God had been\r\npleased to promise redemption through the merits of Jesus Christ, and\r\nthat baptism or the desire for baptism is necessary for salvation. The\r\ndecrees dealt also with the method of preparing for Justification,\r\nwith its nature, causes, and conditions, with the kind of faith\r\nrequired in opposition to the confidence spoken of by the Reformers,\r\nwith the necessity and possibility of observing the commandments, with\r\nthe certainty of Justification, perseverance, loss of Grace by mortal\r\nsin, and with merit. The 7th public session (3rd March) was given to\r\ndecrees regarding the Sacraments in general and Baptism and\r\nConfirmation in particular.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the long-expected civil war had begun in Germany, and Europe\r\nawaited with anxiety the result of a struggle upon which such\r\nmomentous interests might depend. Charles, supported by most of the\r\nCatholic and not a few of the Protestant princes, overthrew the forces\r\nof the Elector of Saxony and of Philip of Hesse (1547) and by his\r\nvictory found himself for the first time master in his own\r\nterritories. Coupled with rejoicing at the success of the imperial\r\narms there was also the fear in many minds that the Emperor might use\r\nhis power to overawe the Council, and force it to agree to\r\ncompromises, which, however useful for the promotion of unity in\r\nGermany, might be subversive of the doctrine and discipline of the\r\nChurch and dangerous to the prerogatives of the Holy See. The\r\nselection of Trent as the place of assembly for the council was never\r\nvery satisfactory to the Pope, but now in the changed circumstances of\r\nthe Empire it was looked upon as positively dangerous. An epidemic\r\nthat made its appearance in the city afforded an excellent pretext for\r\nsecuring a change of venue, and at the 8th public session (11th March\r\n1547) a majority of the members present voted in favour of retiring to\r\nBologna. The legates accompanied by most of the bishops departed\r\nimmediately, while the bishops who supported the Emperor remained at\r\nTrent. For a time the situation was critical in the extreme, but under\r\nthe influence of the Holy Ghost moderate counsels prevailed with both\r\nparties, and after a couple of practically abortive sessions at\r\nBologna the council was prorogued in September 1549. A few months\r\nlater, November 1549, Paul III. passed to his reward.\r\n\r\nIn the conclave that followed the cardinals were divided into three\r\nparties, namely, the Imperial, the French, and the followers of the\r\nFarnese family. By an agreement between the two latter Cardinal del\r\nMonte was elected against the express prohibition of Charles V., and\r\ntook as his title Julius III.[2] (1550-5). He was a man of good\r\neducation, of sufficiently liberal views, and with a rather large\r\nexperience acquired as a prominent official in Rome and as one of the\r\nlegates at the Council of Trent. While acting in the latter capacity\r\nhe had come into sharp conflict with the Emperor, but as Pope he found\r\nhimself forced by the conduct of the Farnese family to cultivate\r\nfriendly relations with his former opponent. The alliance concluded\r\nwith the Emperor turned out disastrously enough owing to the French\r\nvictories in Italy during the campaign of 1552, and in consequence of\r\nthis Julius III. ceased to take an active part in the struggle between\r\nthese two countries. During the earlier years of his reign the Pope\r\ntook earnest measures to push forward the work of reform, patronised\r\nthe Jesuits, established the /Collegium Germanicum/ at Rome for the\r\nuse of ecclesiastical students from Germany, and succeeded in\r\nrestoring England to communion with the Holy See, but as time passed,\r\ndiscouraged by the failure of his cherished projects, he adopted a\r\npolicy of /laissez-faire/, and like many of his predecessors laid\r\nhimself open to damaging though to a great extent unfounded charges of\r\nnepotism.\r\n\r\nJulius III. was anxious to continue the work of reform that had been\r\nbegun in Trent. In 1550 he issued a Bull convoking the council to meet\r\nonce more in Trent on the 1st May 1551. When the papal legates\r\nattended at the time fixed for the opening of the council they found\r\nit necessary owing to the small numbers present to adjourn it at first\r\ntill the 1st September, and later till the 11th October. On account of\r\nthe unfriendly relations existing between France and the Empire\r\nregarding the Duchy of Parma, and to the alliance of the Pope and the\r\nEmperor, the King of France would not permit the French bishops to\r\nattend. The majority of the bishops present were from Italy, Germany,\r\nand Spain. In the 13th public session (11th Oct. 1551), at which there\r\nwere present in addition to the legates, ten archbishops and fifty-\r\nfour bishops, decrees were passed regarding the Real Presence of\r\nChrist in the Eucharist, Transubstantiation, the institution,\r\nexcellence and worship of the Eucharist, its reservation and the\r\nconditions necessary for its worthy reception. In the 14th public\r\nsession (25th Nov. 1551) the council dealt with the sacraments of\r\nPenance and Extreme Unction. In the meantime the Emperor was\r\nnegotiating with the Lutherans with the object of inducing them to\r\nsend representatives to Trent. Some of their procurators had arrived\r\nalready, amongst them being the well-known theologian and historian\r\nJohn Sleidanus of Strassburg, but their demands, including the\r\nwithdrawal of the decrees contravening the articles of the Augsburg\r\nConfession and the submission of the Pope to the authority of a\r\nGeneral Council, were of such an extravagant character that they could\r\nnot be entertained. While the subject was under consideration news\r\narrived that Maurice of Saxony had gone over to the side of the\r\nLutherans, that there was no army in the field to hold him in check,\r\nthat the passes of the Tyrol were occupied by his troops, and that an\r\nadvance upon Trent was not impossible. Many of the bishops took their\r\ndeparture immediately, and in April 1552 against the wishes of a few\r\nSpanish bishops the council was suspended for two years. As a matter\r\nof fact close on ten years were to elapse before the work that had\r\nbeen interrupted could be resumed.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Julius III. (1555) Marcellus II. succeeded, but his\r\nreign was cut short by death (22 days). In the conclave that followed\r\nCardinal Pietro Caraffa, the first general and in a certain sense the\r\nfounder of the Theatines, received the required majority of votes\r\nnotwithstanding the express veto of the Emperor. He was proclaimed\r\nPope under the title of Paul IV.[3] (1555-9). During his life as an\r\necclesiastic the new Pope had been remarkable for his rigid views, his\r\nascetic life, and his adherence to Scholastic as opposed to Humanist\r\nviews. As nuncio in Spain he had acquired a complete distrust of the\r\nSpanish rulers, nor was this bad impression likely to be removed by\r\nthe treatment he received from the Austro-Spanish party when appointed\r\nArchbishop of Naples. The conclusion of the religious peace of\r\nAugsburg (1555) and the proclamation of Ferdinand I. were not\r\ncalculated to win the sympathy of Paul IV. for the House of Habsburg.\r\nHence, he put himself in communication with the Italian opponents of\r\nPhilip II. of Spain, and concluded an alliance with France. The French\r\narmy despatched to Naples under the leadership of the Duke of Guise\r\nwas out-manoeuvred completely by the Spanish Viceroy, the Duke of Alva,\r\nwho followed up his success by invading the Papal States and\r\ncompelling the Pope to sue for peace (1556). The unfriendly relations\r\nexisting between Paul IV. and Philip II. of Spain, the husband of\r\nQueen Mary I., rendered difficult the work of effecting a complete\r\nreconciliation between England and the Holy See. Owing to the\r\ndisturbed condition of Europe and the attitude of the Emperor and the\r\nKing of Spain, it would have been impossible for the Pope even had he\r\nbeen anxious to do so to re-convoke the council. He would not so much\r\nas consider the idea of selecting Trent or any German city as a fit\r\nplace for such an assembly, while the Austro-Spanish rulers were\r\nequally strong against Rome or any other place in Italy. But of his\r\nown initiative Paul IV. took strong measures to reform the Roman\r\nCuria, established a special commission in Rome to assist him in this\r\nwork, stamped out by vigorous action heretical opinions that began to\r\nmanifest themselves in Italy, and presided frequently himself at\r\nmeetings of the Inquisition. He even went so far as to arrest Cardinal\r\nMorone on a suspicion of heresy, and to summon Cardinal Pole to appear\r\nbefore the tribunal of the Inquisition. By the Romans he had been\r\nbeloved at first on account of his economic administration whereby the\r\ntaxes were reduced considerably, but the disastrous results of the war\r\nagainst Philip II. in Naples effaced the memory of the benefits he had\r\nconferred, and he died detested by the people. After his death the\r\ncity was at the mercy of the mob, who plundered and robbed wholesale\r\nfor close on a fortnight before order could be restored.\r\n\r\nIn the conclave that followed the two great parties among the\r\ncardinals were the French and the Austro-Spanish, neither of which,\r\nhowever, was strong enough to procure the election of its nominee.\r\nAfter a struggle lasting three months Cardinal Giovanni Angelo de'\r\nMedici, who was more or less neutral, was elected by acclamation. He\r\nwas proclaimed under the title of Pius IV. (1559-65). The new Pope had\r\nnothing of the stern morose temperament of his predecessor. He was of\r\na mild disposition, something of a scholar himself, inclined to act as\r\na patron towards literature and art, and anxious to forward the\r\ninterests of religion by kindness rather than by severity. He was\r\ndetermined to proceed with the work of the council at all costs, and\r\nas a first step in that direction he devoted all his energies to the\r\nestablishment of friendly relations with the Emperor Ferdinand I. and\r\nwith Spain. In all his schemes for reform he was supported loyally by\r\nhis nephew, Charles Borromeo, whom he created cardinal, and to whom he\r\nentrusted the work of preparing the measures that should be submitted\r\nto the future council.\r\n\r\nWhen all arrangements had been made the Bull of re-convocation,\r\nsummoning the bishops to meet at Trent at Easter 1561, was published\r\nin November 1560. Though not expressly stated in the document, yet it\r\nwas implied clearly enough that the assembly was not to be a new\r\ncouncil but only the continuation of the Council of Trent. This was\r\nnot satisfactory to France, which demanded a revision of some of the\r\ndecrees passed at Trent, and which objected strongly to the selection\r\nof Trent as the meeting-place. The Emperor Ferdinand I. and Philip II.\r\nexpressed their anxiety to further the project of the Pope. Delegates\r\nwere sent from Rome to interview the Lutheran princes and theologians,\r\nbut only to meet everywhere with sharp rebuffs. In an assembly held at\r\nNaumburg in 1561 the Lutherans refused to attend the council, unless\r\nthey were admitted on their own terms, while many of the Catholic\r\nprinces and bishops showed no enthusiasm to respond to the papal\r\nconvocation. When the legates arrived to open the council they found\r\nso few bishops in attendance that nothing could be done except to\r\nprepare the subjects that should be submitted for discussion.\r\n\r\nIt was only on the 15th January 1562 the first (17th) public session\r\ncould be held. There were present in addition to the legates, three\r\npatriarchs, eleven archbishops, forty bishops, four generals of\r\nreligious orders, and four abbots. From the very beginning the legates\r\nfound themselves in a very difficult position owing to the spirit of\r\nhostility against the Holy See manifested by some of the bishops and\r\nrepresentatives of the civil powers. At this session very little was\r\naccomplished except to announce the formal opening of the council, to\r\nfix the date for the next public session, and to prepare safe conducts\r\nfor the delegates of the Protestant princes. Similarly in the 18th\r\npublic session (25th February) no decrees of any importance could be\r\npassed. Despite the earnest efforts of the presidents it was found\r\nimpossible to make any progress. Grave differences of opinion\r\nmanifested themselves both within and without the council. The\r\nquestion whether bishops are bound to reside in their dioceses by\r\ndivine or ecclesiastical law gave rise to prolonged and angry debates.\r\nSpain demanded that it should be stated definitely that the council\r\nwas only a prolongation of the council held previously at Trent, while\r\nFrance insisted that it should be regarded as a distinct and\r\nindependent assembly. The Emperor put forward a far-reaching scheme of\r\nreform parts of which it was entirely impossible for the legates to\r\naccept.[4] At length after many adjournments the 21st public session\r\nwas held (16th July 1562), in which decrees regarding the Blessed\r\nEucharist were passed. It was defined that there was no divine law\r\nobliging the laity to receive Holy Communion under both kinds, that\r\nthe Church has power to make arrangements about Communion so long as\r\nit does not change the substance of the sacrament, that Christ is\r\nreally present whole and entire both under the appearance of bread and\r\nunder the appearance of wine, that infants, who have not come to the\r\nuse of reason, are not bound to receive Holy Communion because they\r\nhave been regenerated already by baptism. At this session there were\r\npresent six cardinals, three patriarchs, nineteen archbishops, and one\r\nhundred and forty-eight bishops.\r\n\r\nIn the 22nd public session (17th Sept. 1562) decrees were published\r\nconcerning the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. It was laid down that in\r\nplace of the sacrifices and the priesthood of the Old Law Christ set\r\nup a new sacrifice, namely the Mass, the clean oblation foretold by\r\nthe prophet Malachy (Mal. I., 11) and a new priesthood, to whom the\r\ncelebration of the Mass was committed, that the sacrifice of the Mass\r\nis the same sacrifice as that of the Cross having the same high priest\r\nand the same victim, that the Mass may be offered up for the dead as\r\nwell as for the living, that it may be offered up in honour of the\r\nSaints, that though the faithful should be advised to receive Holy\r\nCommunion whenever they assist at Mass, yet private Masses at which\r\nnobody is present for Communion are not unlawful, and that, though it\r\nwas not deemed prudent to allow the sacrifice to be offered up in the\r\nvulgar tongue, it was the earnest wish of the council that priests\r\nshould explain the ceremonies of the Mass to the people especially on\r\nSundays and holidays. The question of allowing the laity to receive\r\nthe chalice was discussed at length, and it was decided finally to\r\nsubmit it to the decision of the Pope. Pius IV. did, indeed, make a\r\nconcession on this point in favour of several districts in Austria;\r\nbut as the Catholics did not desire such a concession and the\r\nLutherans refused to accept it as insufficient the indult remained\r\npractically a dead-letter, and later on was withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe next session was fixed for November 1562 but on account of very\r\ngrave difficulties that arose a much more prolonged adjournment was\r\nrendered necessary. During this interval the old controversies broke\r\nout with greater violence and bitterness, and more than once it\r\nappeared as if the council would break up in disorder; but the\r\nperseverance, tact, and energy of the new legates, Cardinals Morone\r\nand Navagero, strengthened by the prudent concessions made by the\r\nPope, averted the threatened rupture, and made it possible for the\r\nFathers to accomplish the work for which they had been convoked.\r\nCardinal Guise[5] (de Lorraine) accompanied by a number of French\r\nbishops and theologians arrived at Trent in November 1562. His arrival\r\nstrengthened the hands of those Spanish bishops who were insisting on\r\nhaving it defined that the obligation of episcopal residence was /de\r\njure divino/. The question had been adjourned previously at the\r\nrequest of the legates, but with the advent of the discussion on the\r\nsacrament of Orders further adjournment was impossible. Several of the\r\nbishops maintained that the obligation must be /jure divino/, because\r\nthe episcopate itself was /de jure divino/. From this they concluded\r\nthat the bishops had their jurisdiction immediately from Christ, not\r\nmediately through the Pope as some of the papal theologians\r\nmaintained. Consequently they asserted that the subordination of the\r\nbishops to the Pope was not, therefore of divine origin, thereby\r\nraising at once the whole question of the relations of a general\r\ncouncil to a Pope and the binding force of the decrees regarding the\r\nsuperiority of a council passed at Constance and Basle.\r\n\r\nAt the same time danger threatened the council from another quarter.\r\nThe Emperor, Ferdinand I. had put forward a very comprehensive scheme\r\nof reform. Some portions of this were considered by the legates to be\r\nprejudicial to the rights of the Holy See, and were therefore rejected\r\nby them after consultation with the Pope. Ferdinand annoyed by their\r\naction asserted that there was no liberty at the council, that it was\r\nbeing controlled entirely from Rome, and that the assembly at Trent\r\nhad become merely a machine for confirming what had been decreed\r\nalready on the other side of the Alps. At his request several of his\r\nsupporters left Trent and joined him at Innsbruck, where a kind of\r\nopposition assembly was begun. Cardinal Morone, realising fully the\r\nseriousness of the situation, betook himself to Innsbruck (April 1563)\r\nfor a personal interview with the Emperor. The meeting had the result\r\nof clearing away many of the misunderstandings that had arisen, and of\r\nbringing about a compromise. At the same time the Pope wrote a letter\r\npointing out that it was only reasonable that the Head of the Church,\r\nnot being present at the council, should be consulted by his legates\r\nin all important matters that might arise.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the council was still engaged in discussing the authority of\r\nthe bishops. On the ground that the Fathers should define at one and\r\nthe same time both the rights of the bishops and the rights of the\r\nHoly See Cardinal Guise, who represented the Gallican school of\r\nthought, brought forward certain proposals highly derogatory to the\r\nprerogatives of the Pope. In face of this counter-move the legates\r\nwere firm but conciliatory. They pointed out that the whole question\r\nof the jurisdiction of the Holy See had been decided already by the\r\nCouncil of Florence and that the decrees of Florence could not be\r\nwatered down at Trent. On this question the Italian bishops found\r\nthemselves supported by the vast majority of the Spanish, Austro-\r\nGerman and Portuguese representatives; but in deference to the request\r\nof the Pope, who wished that nothing should be defined unless with the\r\nunanimous consent of the Fathers, and to the feelings of the French,\r\nwhose secession from the council was anticipated, it was agreed to\r\nissue no decree on the subject. As the supreme authority of the Pope\r\nhad been recognised implicitly by the council[6] no definition was\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the negotiations inside and outside the council it was\r\npossible to hold the 23rd public session on the 15th July 1563. In\r\nthis it was defined that the priesthood of the New Law was instituted\r\nby Christ, that there were seven orders in the Church about two of\r\nwhich, the priesthood (/de sacerdotibus/) and the diaconate (/de\r\ndiaconis/) express mention is made in the Scriptures, that the bishops\r\nwho have succeeded to the place of the Apostles pertain especially to\r\nthe hierarchy and are superior to priests, that neither the consent of\r\nthe people nor of the civil power is necessary for the valid reception\r\nof orders, and that bishops who are appointed by the authority of the\r\nRoman Pontiff are true bishops.[7] The question whether the duty of\r\nepiscopal residence is /de jure divino/, about which such a protracted\r\nand heated controversy had been waged, was settled amicably by\r\ndeciding that the bishops as pastors are bound by divine command to\r\nknow their flocks, and that they cannot do this unless they reside in\r\ntheir dioceses. At this session there were present four cardinals,\r\nthree patriarchs, twenty-five archbishops and one hundred and ninety-\r\nthree bishops.\r\n\r\nMany of the bishops were anxious to return to their dioceses, and\r\nnearly all of them hoped for a speedy conclusion of the council. The\r\nPope, the Emperor, and the King of France were in agreement, though\r\nfor different reasons, in endeavouring to dissolve the assembly as\r\nsoon as possible. The sacrament of Matrimony was next proposed for\r\ndiscussion. The French party wished that marriages contracted without\r\nthe consent of the parents as well as clandestine marriages should be\r\ndeclared invalid, but the council refused to make the validity of\r\nmarriage dependent upon parental consent. In deference to the wishes\r\nof Venice, which stood in close relation to the Greeks, it was agreed\r\nto define merely that the Church does not err when she states in\r\naccordance with the apostolic and evangelic teaching that the bond of\r\nmarriage is not broken by adultery. In the 24th public session (11th\r\nNov. 1563) the decrees on Matrimony were proclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe greatest anxiety was displayed on all sides to bring the work to a\r\nconclusion. The action of the papal legates in proposing that the\r\ninterference of Catholic rulers in ecclesiastical affairs should be\r\nconsidered and if necessary reformed did not tend to delay the\r\ndissolution. The princes were most anxious to reform the Pope and\r\nclergy, but they were determined not to allow any weakening of their\r\nown so-called prerogatives. In accordance with the general desire the\r\naddresses were cut short, and so rapid was the progress made that the\r\nlast public session was held on the 3rd and 4th December 1563. The\r\ndecrees on Purgatory, on the honour to be paid to relics and images of\r\nSaints and on Indulgences were passed. It was agreed, furthermore,\r\nthat in regard to fast days and holidays the usage of the Roman Church\r\nshould be followed, and that the Holy See should undertake the\r\npreparation of a new edition of the missal and breviary. The decrees\r\nthat had been passed under Paul III. and Julius III. were read and\r\napproved. The legates were requested to obtain the approval of the\r\nHoly Father for the decisions of the council, and Cardinal Guise in\r\nthe name of the bishops returned thanks to the Pope, the Emperor, the\r\nambassadors of the Catholic nations, and to the legates. Finally the\r\nFathers subscribed their names to the acts of the council. There were\r\nthen present six cardinals, three patriarchs, twenty-five archbishops,\r\none hundred and sixty-seven bishops, and nineteen procurators.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Trent met in peculiarly difficult circumstances, and it\r\ncarried on its work in face of great opposition and disappointments.\r\nMore than once it was interrupted for a long period, and more than\r\nonce, too, it was feared by many that it would result in promoting\r\nschism rather than unity. But under the Providence of God the dangers\r\nwere averted, the counsels of despair were rejected, the arms of its\r\nenemies were weakened, and the hearts of the faithful children of the\r\nChurch throughout the world filled with joy and gratitude. It found\r\nitself face to face with a strong and daily increasing party, who\r\nrejected the authority that had been accepted hitherto without\r\ndifficulty, and who called in question many of the most cherished\r\ndoctrines and practices of the Catholic world. Without allowing\r\nthemselves to be involved in purely domestic disputes among Catholic\r\ntheologians or to be guided by the advice of those who sought to\r\nsecure peace by means of dishonourable compromises, the Fathers of\r\nTrent set themselves calmly but resolutely to sift the chaff from the\r\nwheat, to examine the theories of Luther in the light of the teaching\r\nof the Scriptures and the tradition of the Church as contained in the\r\nwritings of the Fathers, and to give to the world a clear-cut\r\nexposition of the dogmas that had been attacked by the heretics. Never\r\nhad a council in the Church met under more alarming conditions; never\r\nhad a council been confronted with more serious obstacles, and never\r\ndid a council confer a greater service on the Christian world than did\r\nthe 19th ecumenical council held at Trent (1545-63).\r\n\r\nIt was of essential importance that the council should determine the\r\nmatters of faith that had been raised, but it was almost equally\r\nimportant that it should formulate a satisfactory scheme of reform.\r\nReform of the Church in its Head and members was on the lips of many\r\nwhose orthodoxy could not be suspected long before Luther had made\r\nthis cry peculiarly his own, the better thereby to weaken the loyalty\r\nof the faithful to the Holy See. As in matters of doctrine so also in\r\nmatters of discipline the Council of Trent showed a thorough\r\nappreciation of the needs of the Church, and if in some things it\r\nfailed to go as far as one might be inclined to desire the fault is\r\nnot to be attributed to the Popes or the bishops, but rather to the\r\nsecular rulers, whose jealousies and recriminations were one of the\r\ngreatest impediments to the progress of the council, and who, while\r\ncalling out loudly for the reform of others, offered a stubborn\r\nresistance to any change that might lessen their own power over the\r\nChurch, or prevent the realisation of that absolute royalty, towards\r\nwhich both the Catholic and Protestant rulers of the sixteenth century\r\nwere already turning as the ultimate goal of their ambitions.\r\n\r\nThe council struck at the root of many of the abuses that afflicted\r\nthe Christian world by suppressing plurality of benefices, provisions,\r\nand expectancies, as well as by insisting that, except in case of\r\npresentation by a university, nobody could be appointed to a benefice\r\nunless he had shown that he possessed the knowledge necessary for the\r\nproper discharge of his duty. It determined the method of electing\r\nbishops, commanded them to reside in their dioceses unless exempted\r\nfor a time on account of very special reasons, to preach to their\r\npeople, to hold regular visitations of their parishes, to celebrate\r\ndiocesan synods yearly, to attend provincial synods at least once in\r\nthree years, and to safeguard conscientiously the ecclesiastical\r\nproperty committed to their charge.\r\n\r\nIt put an end to abuses in connexion with the use of ecclesiastical\r\ncensures, indulgences, and dispensations, and ordained that all causes\r\nof complaint should be brought before the episcopal court before being\r\ncarried to a higher tribunal. It made useful regulations concerning\r\nthose who should be admitted into diocesan chapters, defined the\r\nrelations between the bishop and his canons, and arranged for the\r\nadministration of the dioceses by the appointment of vicars-capitular\r\nto act during the interregnum. It ordered the secular clergy to be\r\nmindful always of the spiritual dignity to which they had been called,\r\nnot to indulge in any business unworthy of their sacred office,\r\ncondemned concubinage in the strongest terms, and commanded priests to\r\nlook after the religious education of the young, to preach to their\r\nflocks on Sundays and holidays, and to attend zealously to the\r\nspiritual wants of the souls committed to their charge.\r\n\r\nThe council recognised, furthermore, that the best method of securing\r\na high standard of priestly life was the careful training of\r\necclesiastical students. Hence it ordained that in the individual\r\ndioceses seminaries should be established, where those who were\r\ndesirous of entering the clerical state should live apart from the\r\nworld, and where they should receive the education and discipline\r\nnecessary for the successful discharge of their future obligations. It\r\nput an end to many abuses of monastic life, suppressed questing for\r\nalms, drew up rules for the reception of novices, gave the bishop\r\npower to deal with irregularities committed outside the monasteries,\r\nand subjected all priests both regular and secular to episcopal\r\nauthority by insisting on the necessity of Approbation for all who\r\nwished to act as confessors. Finally, in order to apply a remedy\r\nagainst the many scandals and crimes that resulted from secret\r\nmarriages, the Council of Trent laid it down that those marriages only\r\nshould be regarded as valid which should be contracted in the presence\r\nof the parish priest of one of the contracting parties and two\r\nwitnesses.\r\n\r\nOn the conclusion of the Council of Trent Cardinal Morone hastened to\r\nRome with the decrees to seek the approval of the Pope. Some of the\r\nRoman officials, who felt themselves aggrieved by the reforms, advised\r\nthe Pope to withhold his approval of certain decrees, but Pius IV.\r\nrejected this advice. On the 26th January 1564 he issued the Bull of\r\nconfirmation, and set himself to work immediately to put the reforms\r\ninto execution. To assist him in this design he appointed a\r\ncommission, one of the ablest members of which was his own nephew,\r\nCharles Borromeo, and he despatched representatives to the princes and\r\nbishops to ensure their acceptance of the decrees. As an example to\r\nothers he established the Roman Seminary for the education of priests\r\nfor the city. All the princes of Italy received the decrees in a\r\nfriendly spirit and allowed their publication in their territories, as\r\ndid also the King of Portugal. Philip II. acted similarly except that\r\nhe insisted upon the addition of a saving clause \"without prejudice to\r\nroyal authority.\" The Emperor Ferdinand I. hesitated for some time,\r\nbut at last he accepted them in 1566. In France very little opposition\r\nwas raised to the dogmatic decrees, but as several of the practical\r\nreforms, notably those relating to marriages, benefices,\r\necclesiastical punishments, etc., were opposed to civil law,\r\npermission to publish them was refused.\r\n\r\nA profession of faith based on the decrees of the Council of Trent and\r\nof previous councils was drawn up by Pius IV. (13th Nov. 1564), and\r\nits recitation made obligatory on those who were appointed to\r\necclesiastical benefices or who received an academic degree as well as\r\non converts from Protestantism. The Catechism of the Council of Trent\r\n(/Catechismus Romanus/)[8] was prepared at the command of Pius V. and\r\npublished in 1566. It is a valuable work of instruction, approved by\r\nthe highest authority in the Church, and should be in the hands of all\r\nthose who have care of souls.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] Hefner, /Die Enstehungsgeschichte des trienter\r\n    Rechtfertigungsdekrets/, 1909.\r\n\r\n[2] Pastor, op. cit., v., Ciacconius, /Vitae et res gestae Pontificum\r\n    Roman/, 1677.

Though it failed to extinguish the rising flames of heresy or\r\nto restore peace to the Christian world, it had swept away most of the\r\nglaring abuses that had proved the main source of Luther's success,\r\nand rendered impossible for the future any misunderstanding about the\r\ndoctrines that had been called in question. The Catholic Church,\r\npurified by the severe trials through which she had passed, stood\r\nforth once again active and united under the leadership of the\r\nSuccessor of St. Peter, still face to face it is true with a powerful\r\nopposition, but an opposition on which the disintegrating influence of\r\nprivate judgment was already making itself felt. Thus the foundations\r\nof the great Catholic Counter-Reformation were laid securely, and a\r\nmovement was begun which stayed the further advance of Protestantism,\r\nsecured the allegiance of individuals and nations that were wavering,\r\nand won back many who had been seduced from the faith during the early\r\ndays of the religious upheaval.\r\n\r\nBut if the labours of the Fathers of Trent were to be productive of\r\nthe good results that might be anticipated, earnest, religious,\r\nenergetic Popes were required to give a lead to their spiritual\r\nchildren, whose courage had been damped by over thirty years of almost\r\nuninterrupted defeats, to put into force the valuable reforms that had\r\nbeen planned with such minute care, and above all to make the court\r\nand city of Rome an example for the princes and people of the world.\r\nHere, again, the providence of God watching over His Church was\r\nmanifested in a striking manner. Pius IV. deserves to be remembered\r\nwith gratitude by all future generations for the part that he took in\r\nbringing to a successful conclusion the Council of Trent in face of\r\nalmost insuperable difficulties, for having taken such energetic and\r\nwithal such prudent action to secure the acceptance of its decrees and\r\ntheir reduction into practice, and for having given to Rome and to the\r\nCatholic Church so gifted, so saintly, and so disinterested an\r\necclesiastic as his nephew, the Cardinal-Archbishop of Milan, St.\r\nCharles Borromeo.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Pius IV. the conclave, mainly through the exertions of\r\nCardinal Borromeo, elected Cardinal Ghisleri, who took the title of\r\nPius V.[1] (1566-72) in memory of his predecessor. In his youth the\r\nfuture Pope joined the Order of St. Dominic, and for years had acted\r\nas professor of theology, master of novices, and prior. He was noted\r\nspecially for his simplicity and holiness of life, a holiness which it\r\nmay be remarked had nothing in common with the morose rigour of Paul\r\nIV., for his humility, his love of silence and meditation, and for his\r\nkindness towards the poor and the suffering. As a man of good\r\neducation and of conservative tendencies he was summoned to assist\r\nCardinal Caraffa, then president of the Holy Office, and when the\r\nlatter became Pope he was created cardinal and appointed Grand\r\nInquisitor. After his election Pius V. followed still the strict life\r\nof fasting and prayer to which he had been accustomed as a Dominican\r\nfriar. He did not seek to create positions, or to carve out estates\r\nfrom the papal territories for his relatives. Anxious to promote the\r\ntemporal as well as the spiritual welfare of the people in his\r\ntemporal dominions he took steps to see that justice was meted out to\r\npoor and rich, banished women of loose character from the streets, put\r\nan end to degrading amusements, enforced the observance of the Sunday,\r\nand, backed by St. Charles Borromeo and the princes of Italy, he\r\nchanged the whole face of the capital and the country. Rome was no\r\nlonger the half-pagan city of the days of Leo X., nor yet did it\r\npartake of the savage rigour of Geneva.\r\n\r\nPius V. was most anxious to enforce the decrees of Trent, and it was\r\nfor the accomplishment of this object that he had prepared for the\r\ninstruction of pastors the Catechism of the Council of Trent. In\r\ncompliance with the wishes of the bishops he published also a revised\r\nedition of the Roman Breviary and of the Missal. With the Catholic\r\nprinces of Europe he maintained very friendly relations. He furnished\r\nsupplies to Charles IX. of France in his struggle with the Huguenots,\r\nand to Philip II. of Spain in his wars against the Calvinists of the\r\nNetherlands. He encouraged the Emperor, Ferdinand I., and Maximilian\r\nof Bavaria to stand firm against the further encroachments of the\r\nLutherans, and sympathised actively with the unfortunate Queen of\r\nScotland. Having realised that Queen Elizabeth was lost hopelessly to\r\nthe Church and that she was making every effort to involve the whole\r\nEnglish nation in heresy, he directed against her a Bull of\r\nexcommunication and deposition. But though he endeavoured to cultivate\r\nfriendly relations with the Catholic rulers he had no intention of\r\nabandoning the rights of the Church or of yielding in the slightest to\r\nthe increasing demands of the civil power. Against the wishes of some\r\nof his advisers and to the no small annoyance of the Catholic princes\r\nhe republished the Bull, known as the /In Coena Domini/, because he\r\ncommanded that it should be read in all churches on Holy Thursday.\r\n\r\nLike his great namesake Pius II. he had especially at heart the\r\ndefence of Europe against invasion by the Turk. Owing to the religious\r\ncontroversies and the eagerness of some of the princes to ally\r\nthemselves with the Sultan the followers of Islam had grown bolder,\r\nand had shown that they dreamed still of overcoming Western Europe and\r\nof planting the crescent even in the very city of the Popes. Pius V.\r\nappealed to the rulers of Europe to close up their ranks against their\r\ncommon enemy. He granted generous subsidies to the Knights of Malta\r\nand the rulers of Venice and Hungary upon whom the brunt of the\r\nstruggle must inevitably fall. When on the accession of Selim II. in\r\n1570 the danger was pressing, the Pope succeeded in bringing about a\r\nChristian confederacy composed of Spain, Venice, and the Papal States\r\nwith Don Juan of Austria in command of the Christian forces. For the\r\nsuccess of the enterprise the Pope ordered that public prayers and\r\nparticularly the Rosary should be recited in the churches throughout\r\nthe world. The decisive struggle between the two forces, as a result\r\nof which the Turkish fleet was almost completely annihilated, was\r\nfought in the Bay of Lepanto on Sunday, 7th October 1571.[2] In memory\r\nof this great victory the Pope instituted the Feast of the Holy Rosary\r\nto be celebrated for ever on the first Sunday of October. While he was\r\nengaged in making arrangements to follow up his success by driving the\r\nTurks beyond the Bosphorus he was called to his reward. Even by his\r\ncontemporaries Pius V. was regarded as a saint. It is not to be\r\nwondered at, therefore, that one hundred years after his death he was\r\nbeatified, and forty years later, in 1712, he was canonised formally\r\nby Clement XI.\r\n\r\nWhen the cardinals met in conclave, mainly by the intervention of\r\nCardinal Granvelle, viceroy of Philip II. in Naples, Cardinal\r\nBuoncompagni was elected almost immediately, and proclaimed under the\r\ntitle of Gregory XIII. (1572-85). He had been a distinguished student\r\nand professor of law at the University of Bologna, where he had the\r\nhonour of having as his pupils many of the ablest ecclesiastics of the\r\nage. Later on he was sent as confidential secretary to the Council of\r\nTrent. On his return from this assembly he was created cardinal, and\r\nappointed papal legate in Spain. At the time of his election to the\r\nPapacy he had reached his seventieth year. As a young man his life was\r\nnot blameless from the point of view of morality, but after he became\r\na priest nothing could be urged against his conduct even by his worst\r\nenemies. Though it must be admitted that he was not of such an ascetic\r\nand spiritual temperament as his predecessor, he was a man of\r\nirreproachable character, not over anxious to promote his own\r\nrelatives, and determined to strengthen the Catholic Church by raising\r\nthe standard of education and by appointing to the episcopate none but\r\nthe most worthy ecclesiastics. Hence he drew lavishly upon the funds\r\nof the Holy See to erect Catholic Colleges in Rome and in several\r\ncountries of Europe. He founded the magnificent /Collegium Romanum/\r\nfor the education of students from all parts of the world, and placed\r\nit under the administration of the Jesuits, in whom he reposed the\r\nmost signal confidence. As the circumstances that led to the\r\nestablishment of the /Collegium Germanicum/ had not improved, he\r\nconferred on it more generous endowments, and united it later on with\r\nthe college which he had founded for the Hungarians. Owing to the\r\npersecutions in England and Ireland and the suppression of\r\ninstitutions for the education of the clergy, Gregory XIII. founded an\r\nEnglish College (1579) and provided funds for the erection of an Irish\r\nCollege. The money intended for this latter institution was spent in\r\nassisting the Irish in their wars against Elizabeth. In addition to\r\nthis, more than twenty colleges situated in various parts of Europe,\r\namongst them being the Scotch College at Pont-a-Mousson, owe their\r\norigin in whole or in part to his munificence. He was, also, very\r\ndetermined that none but the most worthy men should be appointed to\r\nepiscopal sees, and with this object in view he took pains to inquire\r\npersonally about the merits of distinguished ecclesiastics in each\r\ncountry, and to prepare lists of them for use as vacancies might\r\narise. He was equally careful in the appointments which he made to the\r\ncollege of cardinals. In order to keep touch with the progress of\r\naffairs in Germany he established a nunciature at Vienna in 1581, and\r\nanother at Cologne in the following year. The results of this\r\nexperiment were so successful that in a short time nunciatures were\r\nestablished in nearly all the Catholic countries.[3]\r\n\r\nLike his predecessor he was determined to continue the war against the\r\nTurks, but the circumstances were unfavourable in France and in the\r\nEmpire, while Venice and Spain, the former allies of the Holy See,\r\nconcluded peace with the Sultan. In England and Ireland neither by\r\npeaceful measures nor by the expeditions fitted out by him in\r\nconnexion with the Desmond Rebellion was he able to achieve any\r\nlasting results. His legates succeeded in inducing John III. of Sweden\r\nto abjure heresy and to return to the bosom of the Catholic Church,\r\nbut, unfortunately, the conversion lasted only until political\r\ncircumstances demanded another change. In Russia his representatives\r\narranged a peace with Poland, and put an end for the time to any\r\nactive persecution of Catholicism within the Russian dominions.[4] In\r\nall parts of Europe, where Catholic rulers found themselves in\r\ndifficulties, subsidies were sent by Gregory XIII. to their\r\nassistance. Charles IX. in France, Philip II. of Spain, Austria, the\r\nKnights of Malta, and the Catholics of England and Ireland shared\r\nlargely in his munificence.\r\n\r\nHe issued a new edition of the Roman Martyrology in 1584, and directed\r\nthat it should be used to the exclusion of all others. His predecessor\r\nhad appointed a committee of jurists to prepare a revised edition of\r\nthe Decrees of Gratian. He had been a member of that commission, and\r\nas Pope he brought the work to a successful conclusion. But the\r\nachievement for which he will be best remembered is undoubtedly the\r\nGregorian Calendar. The errors of the calendar had been noticed by\r\nmany, but how to correct them and prevent them for the future was the\r\nproblem that was still unsolved. Gregory XIII. appointed a body of\r\nexperts to examine the subject, the most prominent of whom were the\r\nJesuit Father Clavius and Cardinal Sirleto. The committee had the\r\nadvantage of having before them the papers of the Italian scientist,\r\nLilius, and the suggestions of the Catholic universities. In 1582 the\r\nGregorian Calendar was published, and was accepted generally in all\r\nthe Catholic countries of Europe. But for a long time the Protestant\r\ncountries, believing that nothing good could come from Rome, remained\r\nattached to the old style. It was only in 1700 that the Gregorian\r\nCalendar was accepted in Germany and Holland, and at a still later\r\nperiod (1752) England consented to the change. The following year\r\nSweden followed suit, and by 1775 the use of the new calendar had\r\nbecome general outside Russia and the other countries involved in the\r\nEastern schism, in which the old style is followed till the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe immense sums expended by Gregory XIII. in endowing colleges and\r\nsubsidising Catholic sovereigns proved too great a strain on the\r\nresources of the papal treasury. To raise funds the Pope was obliged\r\nto increase the taxes, to impose tariffs on imports and exports, to\r\ncurtail the privileges of certain sections of his subjects, and to\r\nrecall many of the fiefs granted to feudal proprietors. These measures\r\nled to grave discontent among all classes. Secret societies were\r\nformed, in which the dispossessed nobles encouraged their poorer\r\nfollowers to acts of violence. Robber bands led by some of the younger\r\nbarons made their appearance in all parts of the Papal States, so that\r\neven in the very streets of Rome the lives of the papal officials were\r\nnot secure. Gregory XIII. was too old to cope with such a serious\r\nsituation. Before order could be restored he passed away leaving his\r\nsuccessor a very difficult task.\r\n\r\nAfter a conclave lasting only four days Cardinal Felice Peretti,\r\nbetter known as the Cardinal di Montalto, secured the required\r\nmajority of votes, and ascended the papal throne under the name of\r\nSixtus V.[5] (1585-90). He belonged to a very poor family in Italy,\r\nhad joined the Franciscans as a boy, and had risen from office to\r\noffice till at last in 1570 he was created cardinal. At the time of\r\nhis election he was practically unknown, partly because he was not a\r\nscion of one of the leading families of Italy, partly, also, because\r\nduring the reign of Gregory XIII. with whom he was in disagreement he\r\nlived a retired life, devoting himself almost completely to the\r\npreparation of an edition of the works of St. Ambrose. Throughout the\r\nCatholic world the news of his elevation was received with joy. He was\r\na man of strict life and tireless activity, more inclined to act than\r\nto speak, unwilling to burthen his spiritual or temporal subjects with\r\nnew laws, but fully determined to enforce those already made, and\r\nalmost unchangeable in his views once his decision had been given.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of order in the Papal States and the suppression of\r\nthe robbers who terrorised peaceful citizens were the first work to\r\nwhich he directed his attention. Nor was it long till the severe and\r\nalmost extreme measures he adopted, and in which he was supported by\r\nthe Italian princes, produced their effect. The bankrupt condition of\r\nthe papal treasury necessitated a close revision of the papal\r\nfinances, and so well did Sixtus V. succeed in this respect that he\r\nwas able to bequeath to his successor immense reserves. Though very\r\ncareful about expenditure for his own uses or on the papal court he\r\nspent money freely on the erection and decoration of churches, and on\r\nthe improvement of the city of Rome. He extended the Vatican Library,\r\nin connexion with which he established a new printing-press, provided\r\na good water supply (/Acqua Felice/), built the Lateran Palace,\r\ncompleted the Quirinal, restored the columns of Trajan and Antoninus,\r\nerected the obelisks of the Vatican, St. Mary Major, the Lateran and\r\nSanta Maria del Popolo, and built several new streets to beautify the\r\ncity and to prevent congestion.\r\n\r\nHis administrative ability manifested itself in the establishment of\r\nvarious congregations, to each of which was committed some particular\r\ndepartment of work in the administration of the Church and of the\r\nPapal States. Hitherto most of this work had been done by the\r\n/auditores/ or the /penitentiarii/ according as it belonged to the\r\nexternal or internal forum, or else in consistories of the cardinals.\r\nThe idea of Sixtus V. was not entirely a novel one. The Congregation\r\nof the Index (1571) and the Holy Office (1588) had been established\r\nalready, as also a commission to watch over the execution of the\r\ndecrees of the Council of Trent (1564). By the Bull, /Immensa Aeterni\r\nDei/[6] (11th Feb. 1588) Sixtus V. established fifteen different\r\ncongregations, the most important of which were the Congregation of\r\nthe Index, of the Inquisition, of the Signatura, of the Council of\r\nTrent, of Rites and Ceremonies, and of Bishops and Regulars. By means\r\nof these various bodies the work was done better and more\r\nexpeditiously without impairing in the slightest the authority of the\r\nPope. In 1586 he issued the Bull, /Postquam verus/ by which he fixed\r\nthe number of cardinals at seventy, namely, six cardinal-bishops,\r\nfifty cardinal-priests and fourteen cardinal-deacons. He had prepared\r\nand published a new edition of the Septuagint (1588) as a preparation\r\nfor the revised edition of the Vulgate, which was brought out later,\r\nand was of so faulty a character that it was necessary to withdraw it\r\nfrom circulation.\r\n\r\nSixtus V. had great hopes of inducing the princes of Europe to form an\r\nalliance against the Turks, and, indeed, it was with a view to some\r\nsuch struggle that he laid aside such immense reserves, but his hopes\r\nwere doomed to disappointment. In England no progress could be made,\r\nmore especially as the defeat of the Spanish Armada served only to\r\nstrengthen the throne of Elizabeth. The condition of affairs in France\r\nwas calculated to cause the Pope great anxiety. The murder of the\r\nCatholic leaders and the alliance of Henry III. with the Calvinist\r\nKing of Navarre compelled the Pope to espouse warmly the cause of\r\nSpain and the League. But towards the end of his reign Sixtus V. began\r\nto realise that Spain's intervention in favour of the League was not\r\nnearly so disinterested as it might seem, and that the aim of Spanish\r\nstatesmen was the union of the two countries in one great empire, an\r\nevent which, were it to come to pass, might be as dangerous for the\r\nHoly See as for the succession of Henry of Navarre. He was, therefore,\r\nmore inclined to compromise than to fight.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Urban VII., Gregory XIV., and Innocent X., who\r\nfollowed one another in rapid succession, a large number of the\r\ncardinals, determined to put an end to the dominating influence of\r\nSpain, put forward as the candidate of their choice Cardinal\r\nAldobrandini, whose election had been vetoed twice before by the\r\nSpanish representatives. Notwithstanding the opposition of Spain they\r\nsucceeded in their effort, and Cardinal Aldobrandini was proclaimed\r\nunder the title of Clement VIII.[7] (1592-1605). The character of the\r\nnew Pope both as a man and an ecclesiastic was beyond the shadow of\r\nreproach. He was the special disciple and friend of St. Philip Neri\r\nwho acted as his confessor for thirty years. As Pope his choice of a\r\nconfessor fell upon the learned and saintly Baronius whom he insisted\r\nupon creating cardinal. His activity and zeal were manifested soon in\r\nthe visitation which he undertook of the churches and institutions of\r\nRome, and during the course of which he suppressed many abuses.\r\n\r\nThe situation in France was sufficiently delicate. Henry IV. was\r\nbeginning to recognise that notwithstanding his victories he could\r\nnever reign as a Calvinist over a united France. Clement VIII. was\r\nvery decidedly in favour of a solution that would put an end to the\r\nwar and would prevent France from degenerating into a Spanish\r\nprovince. Hence as soon as the conversion of Henry IV. was proved to\r\nbe genuine the Pope acknowledged his title as king of France, and\r\nexhorted French Catholics to receive him as their ruler. Such a course\r\nof action was of necessity displeasing to Spain, but a few years later\r\nthe Pope had the happiness of putting an end to the struggle between\r\nthese two countries. During his term of office Clement VIII. founded\r\nat Rome a national college for providing priests for the mission in\r\nScotland, issued a revised edition of the Vulgate (1598), of the\r\nBreviary, the Missal, the Caerimonial and the Pontifical, and\r\ninstituted the /Congregatio de Auxilis/ to investigate the matters in\r\ndispute between the Thomists and the Molinists. He presided personally\r\nat many of its sessions though he never issued a definite sentence. It\r\nwas also during his reign that the infamous ex-monk Giordano Bruno was\r\ncondemned by the Inquisition, handed over to the secular power, and\r\nburned at the stake (17th Feb. 1600). In his youth Giordano joined the\r\nDominicans, from which order he fled because definite charges of\r\nheresy, the truth of which he could not deny, were brought against\r\nhim. Later on he was excommunicated by the Calvinists of Geneva and\r\nthe Lutherans of Germany, and refused permission to lecture by the\r\nprofessors of Oxford when he visited that seat of learning. Many of\r\nhis writings are strongly anti-Christian, and some of them thoroughly\r\nindecent. He was condemned to die solely on account of his denial of\r\nthe Divinity of Christ and other heretical views and not, as is said\r\nby some, because he defended the Copernican system.[8]\r\n\r\nLeo XI. succeeded, but survived his election less than a month. The\r\nchoice of the conclave then fell upon Cardinal Borghese who took as\r\nhis title Paul V.[9] (1605-21). He had been a distinguished law\r\nstudent of Bologna and Padua, a papal legate in Spain, and under\r\nClement VIII. cardinal-vicar of Rome. He was a man of great energy and\r\nzealous for the promotion of religion. During his reign he canonised\r\nSt. Charles Borromeo and issued a decree of beatification in favour of\r\nIgnatius of Loyola, Francis Xavier, and Philip Neri, provided generous\r\nsubsidies for the advancement of the missions, endeavoured to bring\r\nabout a re-union with some of the separated religious bodies of the\r\nEast, and spent money freely on the decoration of the Roman churches,\r\nnotably St. Peter's, which he had the honour of completing. Like his\r\npredecessors he was desirous of continuing the war against the Turks,\r\nbut the state of affairs in western Europe rendered such a scheme\r\nimpossible of realisation. With France and Spain he preserved friendly\r\nrelations, tried to put an end to the rivalries that weakened the\r\nHouse of Habsburg and the Catholic cause in the Empire, and despatched\r\nsupplies of both men and money to the assistance of Ferdinand II. in\r\nhis struggle with the Protestants. He wrote to James I. of England\r\n(1606) congratulating him on his accession and his escape from death\r\nand asking for toleration of the Catholic religion, in return for\r\nwhich he promised to induce the Catholics to submit to all things not\r\nopposed to the law of God. The reply of the king to this overture was\r\nthe well-known Oath of Allegiance, that led to such ugly controversies\r\namong the Catholic body.\r\n\r\nAs an earnest student of canon law Paul V. was too inclined to\r\nmaintain all the rights and privileges of the Church as they were\r\nexpounded in the decretals of the Middle Ages. This attitude of mind\r\nbrought him into a prolonged and inglorious conflict with the republic\r\nof Venice. This latter state, regardless of the /privilegium fori/\r\nimprisoned two clerics without reference to the ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities, and about the same time gave great offence by passing\r\nlaws rendering it difficult for the Church to acquire ownership of\r\nlanded property, to build new churches or monasteries, or to found new\r\nreligious orders or societies. Paul V. lodged a solemn protest against\r\nthese innovations. When his demands were not complied with he issued a\r\nsentence of excommunication against the Doge, Senate, and Government,\r\nand later on he placed Venice under interdict (1606). The quarrel was\r\nso bitter that at one time it was feared that it might end in\r\nseparating the republic from the centre of unity. Cardinals Baronius\r\nand Bellarmine entered the lists in defence of the Pope, while the\r\nnotorious ex-Servite, Paul Sarpi[10] (1552-1623), undertook to reply\r\nto them on behalf of Venice. The government forbade the promulgation\r\nof the interdict, and threatened the most severe punishment against\r\nall clergy who should observe it. With the exception of the Jesuits,\r\nCapuchins, and Theatines who were expelled, the clergy both secular\r\nand regular took no notice of the interdict. It was feared that in the\r\nend the issues could be decided only by war in which Spain was\r\nprepared to support the Pope, but through the friendly intervention of\r\nHenry IV. of France peace was concluded without any very decisive\r\nvictory on either side (1607). The clergy who were expelled for\r\nobeying the interdict were allowed to return except the Jesuits. These\r\nlatter were permitted to settle in Venice again only in 1657.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Paul V. Cardinal Ludovisi ascended the papal throne\r\nunder the title of Gregory XV. (1621-23). The new Pope had been\r\neducated by the Jesuits, and had risen rapidly in the service of the\r\nChurch. At the time of his election he was old and infirm, but by the\r\nappointment of his nephew Ludovico to the college of cardinals he\r\nsecured for himself an able and loyal assistant. To put an end to\r\nseveral abuses that had taken place in connexion with papal elections\r\nhe published the Bull, /Decet Romanum Pontificem/ (1622), in which\r\nwere laid down minute regulations about conclaves, the most important\r\nof which were that the cardinals should vote secretly, that they\r\nshould vote only for one candidate, and that no elector should vote\r\nfor himself.[11] In providing funds for the assistance of the Catholic\r\nmissions Gregory XV. was very generous as was also his cardinal-\r\nnephew. The success of the missionaries had been so great, and the\r\nconditions of the various countries in which they laboured so\r\ndifferent, that proper supervision of the new provinces of the Church\r\nwas by no means easy. Gregory XIII. and Clement VIII. had appointed\r\ncommissions to look after the spiritual wants of particular districts,\r\nbut it was reserved for Gregory XV. to establish a permanent\r\ncongregation, /De Propaganda Fide/ (Bull, /Inscrutabili/, 1622) to\r\nsuperintend the entire field of Catholic missions. He had the honour,\r\ntoo, of canonising St. Ignatius of Loyola, St. Francis Xavier, and St.\r\nPhilip Neri, and of approving the foundation of several new religious\r\norders.\r\n\r\nDuring the Thirty Years' War he afforded every possible assistance to\r\nFerdinand II., and helped to secure the Palatinate for Maximilian of\r\nBavaria on the expulsion of Frederick. In return for this favour\r\nMaximilian presented the Pope with a goodly portion of the library of\r\nHeidelberg. By the judicious interposition of Gregory XV. war was\r\naverted between Spain and Austria on the one side and France, Venice,\r\nand Savoy on the other regarding the possession of the Valtelline,\r\nwhile in England, though the Spanish Match which he favoured was\r\nbroken off, he succeeded in securing some respite for the persecuted\r\nCatholics.\r\n\r\nIn the conclave that followed upon the death of Gregory XV. Cardinal\r\nBarberini received the support of the electors and was proclaimed Pope\r\nas Urban VIII. (1623-44). The new Pope was a man of exemplary life\r\nwhose greatest fault was his excessive partiality towards his\r\nrelatives, though it must be said that some of the relatives on whom\r\nhe bestowed favours were by no means unworthy of them. As a native of\r\nFlorence he seems to have caught up something of the spirit of\r\nclassical learning for which that city had been so renowned, as was\r\nshown unfortunately too clearly in the Breviary that he published in\r\n1632. He issued the Bull, /In Coena Domini/ in its final form, founded\r\na national college in Rome for students from Ireland, and issued a\r\nseries of strict and minute regulations on canonisation and\r\nbeatification, many of which remain in force till the present time.\r\nThe interests of the foreign missions were specially dear to the heart\r\nof Urban VIII. To provide a supply of priests for them he established\r\nthe celebrated /Collegium Urbanum/ (1627), and established there a\r\nprinting-press for the use of the missionaries. He reduced the number\r\nof holidays of obligation, opened China and Japan, till then reserved\r\nfor the Jesuits, to all missionaries, and forbade slavery of\r\nwhatsoever kind in Paraguay, Brazil and the West Indies.\r\n\r\nFor many reasons the political policy of Urban VIII. has been\r\ncriticised very severely. Too much money was wasted by him in\r\nfortifying the Papal States and on the disastrous war with the Duke of\r\nParma (1641-44). He has been blamed also for his failure to support\r\nFerdinand II. more energetically during the Thirty Years' War, but in\r\nreality this hostile view is based largely on a distorted view of the\r\nwar itself and of the policy of the Pope. It is not true that the Pope\r\nsympathised with Gustavus Adolphus or that he grieved over his death.\r\nNeither is it true that he procured the dismissal of Wallenstein from\r\nthe imperial service. It is a fact undoubtedly that he did not take\r\nenergetic measures to prevent the French from assisting the Protestant\r\nprinces and the Swedes against the Emperor, but it remains to be\r\nproved that any remonstrances from the Pope, however strong, would\r\nhave proved effectual in the circumstances. In the later stages at any\r\nrate the war could not be regarded at first sight as a religious one,\r\nbut at the same time it is to be regretted that Urban VIII. did not\r\nrecognise that the triumph of the enemies of the Emperor meant a\r\ntriumph for Lutheranism. In the war between Spain and Portugal\r\nconsequent upon the proclamation of the Duke of Braganza he\r\nendeavoured to preserve an attitude of neutrality by refusing to\r\nappoint to episcopal sees in Portugal the candidates presented by the\r\nnew king. The policy of Urban VIII. in regard to England and Ireland\r\nwill be dealt with under these countries.\r\n\r\nWhen the conclave met to elect a successor to Urban VIII. it was soon\r\ndiscovered that some of the cardinals wished to elect a Pope friendly\r\nto Spain, wile others favoured a pro-French Pope. At length, as\r\nneither party was sufficiently strong to ensure the required majority\r\nfor its nominee, a more or less neutral candidate was found in the\r\nperson of Cardinal Pamfili who took the title of Innocent X. (1644-\r\n55).[12] He was a man of advanced years, who had served in many\r\noffices with success, and who possessed many of the qualifications\r\nrequired in a good ruler of the Church. Unfortunately, his flagrant\r\nnepotism did him much harm and gave occasion to ugly rumours utterly\r\ndevoid of truth. Finding the papal treasury empty after his election\r\nand believing that the relatives of the late Pope were responsible for\r\nthis, he took steps to secure a return from them; but they fled to\r\nFrance, where they placed themselves under the protection of Cardinal\r\nMazarin, who succeeded in bringing about a reconciliation. Innocent X.\r\nrestored order in the Papal States, punished the Duke of Parma for his\r\ncrimes, especially for his supposed connexion with the murder of the\r\nBishop of Castro, and maintained friendly relations with Venice, which\r\nhe assisted against the Turks. He was deeply pained by the terms of\r\nthe Peace of Westphalia (1648) against which his representatives had\r\nprotested in vain, and which he condemned in the Bull, /Zelus Domus\r\nDei/ published in November 1648.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] /Catena, Vita del gloriossisimo Papa Pio V./, 1587.

Various causes had combined to bring about a relaxation of the\r\ndiscipline prescribed by their holy founders, and to introduce a\r\nspirit of worldliness, that boded ill both for the individual members\r\nas well as for the success of the work for which these orders had been\r\nestablished. The interference of outside authorities lay or\r\necclesiastical in the appointment of superiors, the union of several\r\nhouses under one superior, the accumulation of wealth, the habitual\r\nneglect of the superiors to make their visitations, and a general\r\ncarelessness in the selection and training of the candidates to be\r\nadmitted into the various institutions, were productive of disastrous\r\nresults. It is difficult, however, to arrive at a correct estimate as\r\nto the extent of the evil, because the condition of affairs varied\r\nvery much in the different religious orders and in the different\r\nprovinces and houses of the same order. At all times a large\r\nproportion of the religious of both sexes recognised and deplored the\r\nspirit of laxity that had crept in, and laboured strenuously for a\r\nreturn to the old ideals long before the Lutheran campaign had made it\r\nnecessary to choose between reform and suppression.\r\n\r\nThe Benedictines, who had done excellent work for the promotion of the\r\nspiritual and temporal welfare of the people amongst whom they\r\nlaboured, suffered more than any other body from the interference of\r\nlay patrons in the appointment of abbots, as well as from the want of\r\nany central authority capable of controlling individual houses and of\r\ninsisting upon the observance of the rules and constitution. Various\r\nefforts were made, however, to introduce reforms during the sixteenth\r\ncentury. In France the most important of these reforms was that begun\r\nin the abbey of St. Vannes by the abbot, Didier de la Cour.\r\nRecognising the sad condition of affairs he laboured incessantly to\r\nbring about a return to the strict rule of St. Benedict. His efforts\r\nwere approved by Clement VIII. in 1604. Many houses in France having\r\naccepted the reform, it was resolved to unite them into one\r\ncongregation under the patronage of St. Maur, the disciple of St.\r\nBenedict.[1] The new congregation of St. Maur was sanctioned by Louis\r\nXIII. and by Pope Gregory XV. (1621). The Maurists devoted themselves\r\nto the study of the sacred sciences, more especially to history,\r\nliturgy and patrology, and set an example of thorough scholarship\r\nwhich won for them the praise of both friends and foes. The names of\r\nD'Achery, Mabillon, Ruinart, Martene, Thierry, Lami and Bouquet are\r\nnot likely to be forgotten so long as such works as the /Amplissima\r\nCollectio Veterum Scriptorum/, /Thesaurus Anecdotorum/, /Gallia\r\nChristiana/, /Histoire Litteraire de la France/, /De Re Diplomatica/,\r\n/L'Art de verifier les dates/, the /Receuil des historiens des\r\nGaules/, etc., survive to testify to the labours and research of the\r\nCongregation of St. Maur.[2]\r\n\r\nThe reform movement among the Dominicans had made itself manifest from\r\nthe days of Raymond of Capua (1390), who ordered that in every\r\nprovince there should be at least one house where the rule of St.\r\nDominic might be observed in its original strictness. The success of\r\nthe reform varied in the different countries and even in the different\r\nhouses of the same province, but in the sixteenth century the general\r\ntendency was undoubtedly upwards. The religious rebellion inflicted\r\nserious losses on the order and led to the almost complete extinction\r\nof provinces that once were flourishing; but the Spanish and\r\nPortuguese discoveries in America and the spread of the missionary\r\nmovement opened up for the order new fields, where its members were\r\ndestined to do lasting service to religion and to win back in the New\r\nWorld more than they had lost in the Old. Discipline among the\r\nCistercians, too, had become relaxed, but a general improvement set in\r\nwhich led to the formation of new congregations, the principal of\r\nwhich were the Congregation of the Feuillants approved by Sixtus V.\r\n(1587), and of the Trappists, which take their name from the monastery\r\nof La Trappe and owe their origin to the zealous efforts of the Abbot\r\nde Rance (1626-1700).\r\n\r\nThe Franciscans were divided already into the Observants and the\r\nConventuals, but even among the Observants the deteriorating influence\r\nof the age had made itself felt. Matteo di Bassi set himself in the\r\nconvent of Monte Falco to procure a complete return to the original\r\nrule of St. Francis, and proceeded to Rome to secure the approbation\r\nof Clement VII. In 1528 by the Bull, /Religionis Zelus/ the Pope\r\npermitted himself and his followers to separate from the Observants,\r\nto wear the hood (/cappuccio/, hence the name Capuchins[3]) which\r\nMatteo claimed to have been the dress of St. Francis, to wear the\r\nbeard, to found separate houses in Italy, and to preach to the people.\r\nSoon the Capuchins spread through Italy, and so popular did they\r\nbecome that Gregory XIII. withdrew the regulations by which they were\r\nforbidden to found separate houses outside of Italy. The new order\r\nsuffered many trials more especially after the apostasy of its vicar-\r\ngeneral Ochino in 1544, but with the blessing of God these\r\ndifficulties were overcome. The Capuchins rendered invaluable service\r\nto religion by their simple straightforward style of preaching so\r\nopposed as it was to the literary vapourings that passed for sermons\r\nat the time, by their familiar intercourse with the poor whom they\r\nassisted in both spiritual and temporal misfortunes, by their\r\nunswerving loyalty to the Pope and by the work they accomplished on\r\nthe foreign missions, more especially in those lands which had once\r\nbeen the glory of the Church but where religion had been extinguished\r\nalmost completely by the domination of the Saracen.\r\n\r\nThe revival was not confined, however, merely to a reform of the older\r\nreligious orders. The world had changed considerably since the\r\nconstitutions of these bodies had been formulated by their holy\r\nfounders. New conditions and new dangers necessitated the employment\r\nof new weapons and new methods for the defence of religion.\r\nFortunately a band of zealous men were raised up by God to grapple\r\nwith the problems of the age, and to lay the foundation of religious\r\nsocieties, many of which were destined to confer benefits on religion\r\nhardly less permanent and less valuable than had been conferred in\r\nother times by such distinguished servants of God as St. Benedict, St.\r\nDominic, and St. Francis of Assisi.\r\n\r\nThe Theatines, so called from Chieti (Theate) the diocese of Peter\r\nCaraffa, had their origin in a little confraternity founded by Gaetano\r\ndi Tiene[4] a Venetian, who gathered around him a few disciples, all\r\nof them like himself zealous for the spiritual improvement of both\r\nclergy and people (1524). During a visit to Rome Gaetano succeeded in\r\neliciting the sympathy of Peter Caraffa (then bishop of Theate and\r\nafterwards cardinal and Pope) and in inducing him to become the first\r\nsuperior of the community. The institution was approved by Clement\r\nVII. in 1524. Its founders aimed at introducing a higher standard of\r\nspiritual life amongst both clergy and laity by means of preaching and\r\nby the establishment of charitable institutions. The order spread\r\nrapidly in Italy, where it did much to save the people from the\r\ninfluence of Lutheranism, in Spain were it was assisted by Philip II.,\r\nin France where Cardinal Mazarin acted as its patron, and in the\r\nforeign missions, especially in several parts of Asia, the Theatines\r\nwon many souls to God.\r\n\r\nThe Regular Clerics of St. Paul, better known as the Barnabites from\r\ntheir connexion with the church of St. Barnabas at Milan, were founded\r\nby Antony Maria Zaccaria[5] of Cremona, Bartholomew Ferrari and Jacopo\r\nMorigia. Shocked by the low state of morals then prevalent in so many\r\nItalian cities, these holy men gathered around them a body of zealous\r\nyoung priests, who aimed at inducing the people by means of sermons\r\nand instructions to take advantage of the sacrament of Penance. The\r\norder was approved by Clement VII. in 1533, and received many\r\nimportant privileges from his successors. Its members worked in\r\ncomplete harmony with the secular clergy and in obedience to the\r\ncommands of the bishops. They bound themselves not to seek or accept\r\nany preferment or dignity unless at the express direction of the Pope.\r\nIn Milan they were beloved by St. Charles Borromeo who availed himself\r\nfreely of their services, and they were invited to Annecy by St.\r\nFrancis de Sales. Several houses of the Barnabites were established in\r\nItaly, France, and Austria. In addition to their work of preaching and\r\ninstructing the people they established many flourishing colleges, and\r\nat the request of the Pope undertook charge of some of the foreign\r\nmissions.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the Oblates was St. Charles Borromeo[6] (1538-84) who\r\nwas created cardinal by his uncle Pius IV., at the age of twenty-\r\nthree, and who during his comparatively short life did more for the\r\nreform of the Church and for the overthrow of Protestantism than any\r\nindividual of his age. It was due mainly to his exertions that the\r\nCouncil of Trent was re-convoked, and to his prudent advice that it\r\nwas carried to a successful conclusion. Once the decrees of the\r\nCouncil had received the approval of the Pope St. Charles spared no\r\npains to see that they were put into execution not only in his own\r\ndiocese of Milan but throughout the entire Church. For a long time\r\npersonal government of his diocese was impossible as his presence in\r\nRome was insisted upon by the Pope; but as soon as he could secure\r\npermission he hastened to Milan, where he repressed abuses with a\r\nstern hand, introduced regular diocesan and provincial synods, visited\r\nin person the most distant parts of the diocese, won back thousands\r\nwho had gone over to heresy in the valleys of Switzerland, and\r\ndefended vigorously the rights and the liberties of the Church against\r\nthe Spanish representatives. In all his reforms he was supported\r\nloyally by the religious orders, more especially by the Jesuits and\r\nthe Barnabites, with whom he maintained at all times the most friendly\r\nrelations. At the same time he felt the need of a community of secular\r\npriests, who while remaining under the authority of the bishop would\r\nset an example of clerical perfection, and who would be ready at the\r\nrequest of the bishop to volunteer for the work that was deemed most\r\npressing. he was particularly anxious that such a body should\r\nundertake the direction of the diocesan seminary, and should endeavour\r\nto send forth well educated and holy priests. With these objects in\r\nview he established the Oblates in 1578, and the community fully\r\njustified his highest expectations.\r\n\r\nThe Oratorians[7] were established by St. Philip Neri (1515-95) the\r\nreformer and one of the patrons of Rome. He was a native of Florence,\r\nwho when still a young man turned his back upon a promising career in\r\nthe world in order to devote himself entirely to the service of God.\r\nBefore his ordination he laboured for fifteen years visiting the sick\r\nin the hospitals, assisting the poorer pilgrims, and instructing the\r\nyoung. He formed a special confraternity, and gathered around him a\r\nbody of disciples both cleric and lay. After his ordination they were\r\naccustomed to hold their conferences in a little room (/Oratorium/,\r\nOratory) over the church of St. Girolmao. Here sermons and\r\ninstructions were given on all kinds of subjects, particularly on the\r\nSacred Scriptures, the writings of the Fathers, and the leading events\r\nin the history of the Church. The society was approved by Gregory\r\nXIII. (1575) under the title of the Congregation of the Oratory. It\r\nwas to be composed of secular priests living together under a rule,\r\nbut bound by no special vows. St. Philip Neri was convinced that the\r\nstyle of preaching in vogue at the time was responsible in great\r\nmeasure for the decline of religion and morality. Being a man of sound\r\neducation himself he insisted that his companions should devote\r\nthemselves to some particular department of ecclesiastical knowledge,\r\nand should give the people the fruits of their study. Baronius, for\r\nexample, the author of the celebrated /Annales Ecclesiastici/, is said\r\nto have preached for thirty years on the history of the Church. In\r\nthis way St. Philip provided both for sound scholarship and useful\r\ninstruction. Many branches of the Oratory were founded in Italy,\r\nSpain, Portugal, and in the Spanish and Portuguese colonies in South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nRecognising the need for an improvement in the education and lives of\r\nthe French clergy and mindful of the benefits conferred on Rome by the\r\ncommunity of St. Philip Neri, the Abbe, afterwards Cardinal, Pierre de\r\nBerulle determined to found an Oratory in Paris.[8] The Paris\r\nOratorians were a community of secular priests bound by no special\r\nvows, but living under a common rule with the object of fulfilling as\r\nperfectly as possible the obligations they had undertaken at their\r\nordination. The project received the warm support of Cardinal\r\nRichelieu and was approved by Paul V. in 1613. At the time clerical\r\neducation in Paris and throughout France was in a condition of almost\r\nhopeless confusion. The French Oratorians, devoted as they were\r\nthemselves to study, determined to organise seminaries on the plan\r\nlaid down by the Council of Trent, and to take charge of the\r\nadministration of such institutions. In philosophy the Oratory\r\nproduced scholars such as Malebranche, in theology Thomassin and\r\nMorin, in Scripture Houbigant and Richard Simon, and in sacred\r\neloquence such distinguished preachers as Lajeune and Massillon. The\r\nOratorians survived the stormy days of the Jansenist struggle though\r\nthe peace of the community was disturbed at times by the action of a\r\nfew of its members, but it went down before the wild onslaught of the\r\nRevolution. It was revived, however, by Pere Gratry in 1852.\r\n\r\nThe Brothers of Charity were founded by a Portuguese,[9] who having\r\nbeen converted by a sermon of St. John d'Avila, devoted himself to the\r\nrelief of human suffering in every form. On account of his great\r\ncharity and zeal for souls he received the surname, St. John of God.\r\nHe gathered around him a band of companions who assisted him in caring\r\nfor the sick in the hospital he had founded at Granada. After his\r\ndeath in 1550 the work that he had begun was carried on by his\r\ndisciples, whose constitutions were approved by Pius V. in 1572. Soon\r\nthrough the generosity of Philip II. and of the Spanish nobles\r\nhospitals were established in various cities of Spain, and placed\r\nunder the control of the Brothers of St. John of God. They were\r\ninvited by the Pope to open a house in Rome, and they went also to\r\nParis on the invitation of the queen (1601). At the time of the French\r\nRevolution they had charge of forty hospitals, from all of which they\r\nwere expelled. The founder was canonised in 1690, and named as patron\r\nof hospitals by Leo XIII. in 1898.\r\n\r\nThe Piarists or Patres Piarum Scholarum were founded by St. Joseph\r\nCalazansa[10] (1556-1648), who had been vicar-general of the diocese\r\nof Urgel in Spain, an office which he resigned in order to betake\r\nhimself to Rome. Here he began to gather the poorer children for\r\ninstruction, and as the teachers were unwilling to assist him unless\r\nthey were given extra remuneration, he opened a free school in Rome in\r\n1597. The school was taught by himself and two or three priests whom\r\nhe had interested in the work. From these unpretentious beginnings\r\nsprang the society of the Fathers of the Pious Schools. The object of\r\nthe society, which was composed of priests, was the education of the\r\nyoung both in primary and secondary schools. The society was approved\r\nby Paul V., and established finally as a recognised institution by\r\nGregory XV. (1621). It spread rapidly into Italy, Austria, and Poland.\r\nSomewhat akin to the Piarists were the Fathers of Christian Doctrine,\r\nfounded by Caesar de Bus for the purpose of educating the young. The\r\nsociety was composed of priests, and received the approval of Clement\r\nVIII. in 1597. Later on it united with the Somaschans, who had been\r\nestablished by St. Jerome Aemilian with a similar purpose, but on\r\naccount of certain disputes that arose the two bodies were separated\r\nin 1647.\r\n\r\nThe Brothers of the Christian Schools were founded by John Baptist de\r\nla Salle[11] (1651-1719). The founder was a young priest of great\r\nability, who had read a distinguished course in arts and theology\r\nbefore his ordination. Having been called upon to assist in conducting\r\na free school opened at Rheims in 1679 he threw himself into the work\r\nwith vigour, devoting nearly all his energies to the instruction of\r\nthe teachers. These he used to gather around him after school hours to\r\nencourage them to their work, to suggest to them better methods of\r\nimparting knowledge and generally to correct any defects that he might\r\nhave noticed during the course of his daily visits to the schools. In\r\nthis way he brought together a body of young men interested in the\r\neducation of the children of the poor, from which body were developed\r\nthe Brothers of the Christian Schools. At first he intended that some\r\nof the congregation should be priests, but later on he changed his\r\nmind, and made it a rule that none of the Brothers should become\r\npriests, nor should any priest be accepted as a novice. For a long\r\ntime the holy founder was engaged in an uphill struggle during which\r\nthe very existence of the institute was imperilled. Distrusted by some\r\nof the ecclesiastical authorities, attacked by enemies on all side,\r\ndeserted by a few of his own most trusted disciples, a man of less\r\nzeal and determination would have abandoned the project in despair.\r\nBut de la Salle was not discouraged. He composed a constitution for\r\nhis followers, and in 1717 he held a general chapter, in which he\r\nsecured the election of a superior-general. From this time the\r\nInstitute of Christian Brothers progressed by leaps and bounds. The\r\nholy founder of the society was a pioneer in the work of primary\r\neducation. In teaching, in the grading of the pupils, and in\r\nconstructing and furnishing the schools new methods were followed;\r\nmore liberty was given in the selection of programmes to suit the\r\ndistricts in which schools were opened; normal schools were\r\nestablished to train the young teachers for their duties, and care was\r\ntaken that religious and secular education should go forward hand in\r\nhand. The society spread rapidly in France, more especially after it\r\nhad received the approval of Louis XV., and had been recognised as a\r\nreligious congregation by Benedict XIII. (1725). During the Revolution\r\nthe society was suppressed, and the Brothers of the Christian Schools\r\nsuffered much rather than prove disloyal to the Pope. In 1803 the\r\ninstitute was re-organised, and since that time houses have been\r\nopened in nearly every part of the world. John Baptist de la Salle was\r\ncanonised by Leo XIII. in 1900.\r\n\r\nThe Congregation of the Priests of the Mission, better known as\r\nLazarists from the priory of St. Lazare which they occupied in Paris,\r\nand as Vincentians from the name of their founder, St. Vincent de\r\nPaul, was established in 1624. St. Vincent was born at Pouy in Gascony\r\nin 1576, received his early education at a Franciscan school, and\r\ncompleted his theological studies at the University of Toulouse, where\r\nhe was ordained in 1600. Four years later the ship on which he\r\njourneyed from Marseilles having been attacked by Barbary pirates, he\r\nwas taken prisoner and brought to Tunis, where he was sold as a slave.\r\nHe succeeded in making his escape from captivity (1607) by converting\r\nhis master, a Frenchman who had deserted his country and his religion.\r\nHe went to Rome, from which he was despatched on a mission to the\r\nFrench Court, and was appointed almoner to queen Margaret of Valois.\r\nLater on he became tutor to the family of the Count de Gondi, the\r\nmaster of the French galleys. During his stay there St. Vincent found\r\ntime to preach to the peasants on the estate of his employer, and to\r\nvisit the prisoners condemned to the galleys. The splendid results of\r\nhis labours among these classes bore such striking testimony to the\r\nsuccess of his missions that St. Vincent was induced to found a\r\ncongregation of clergymen for this special work. Something of this\r\nkind was required urgently in France at this period. The absence of\r\nseminaries and the want of any properly organised system of clerical\r\neducation had produced their natural consequences on the clergy. In\r\nthe country districts particularly, the priests had neither the\r\nknowledge nor the training that would enable them to discharge their\r\nsacred functions. From this it followed that the people were not\r\ninstructed, and the sacraments were neglected.\r\n\r\nBy opening a house in Paris in 1624 St. Vincent took the first\r\npractical step towards the foundation of a religious congregation,\r\nthat was destined to renew and to strengthen religion in France. Later\r\non the society received the sanction of the Archbishop of Paris,[12]\r\nand of Louis XIII., and finally it was approved by Urban VIII. in the\r\nBull, /Salvatoris Nostri/, dated 12th January 1632. In the same year\r\nSt. Vincent took possession of the priory of St. Lazare placed at his\r\ndisposal by the canons regular of St. Victor. The Congregation of the\r\nMission was to be a congregation of secular clergymen, bound by simple\r\nreligious vows. Its principal work, besides the sanctification of its\r\nown members, was to give missions to the poor particularly in country\r\ndistricts, and to promote a high standard of clerical life. The\r\nbishops of France were delighted with the programme of the new\r\ncongregation. Invitations poured in from all sides on the disciples of\r\nSt. Vincent asking them to undertake missions, and wherever they went\r\ntheir labours were attended with success. As a rule St. Vincent\r\nestablished a confraternity of charity in the parishes that he visited\r\nto help the poor and above all to look after the homeless orphans.[13]\r\n\r\nIt was not long until he discovered that, however successful his\r\nmissions might be, they could effect little permanent good unless the\r\npriests in charge of the parishes were determined to continue the work\r\nthat had been begun, and to reap the harvest which the missioners had\r\nplanted. At that time there were no seminaries in France, so that\r\ncandidates for the priesthood were ordained on the completion of their\r\nuniversity course without any special training for their sacred\r\noffice. At the request of some of the bishops St. Vincent determined\r\nto give retreats to those who were preparing for Holy Orders. At first\r\nthese retreats lasted only ten days, but they were productive of such\r\nsplendid results that they were extended to several months. Finally\r\nthey led to the establishment of clerical seminaries, of which\r\ninstitutions St. Vincent and his associates took charge in several of\r\nthe dioceses of France. Before his death they had control of eleven\r\nFrench seminaries; and at the time of the Revolution fully one-third\r\nof the diocesan seminaries were in the hands of his disciples.[14] By\r\nmeans of retreats for the clergy, and spiritual conferences organised\r\nfor their improvement St. Vincent kept in close touch with those whom\r\nhe had trained, and afforded them an opportunity of renewing their\r\nfervour and completing their education.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for France that God had raised up a man so prudent\r\nand zealous as St. Vincent to be a guide to both priests and people\r\nduring the difficult times through which the country was then passing.\r\nFrom without, danger threatened the Church on the side of the Huguenot\r\nheretics, and from within, Jansenism and Gallicanism bade fair to\r\ncaptivate the sympathy of both clergy and people. At first St. Vincent\r\nwas on friendly terms with the Abbot de St. Cyran, the leader of the\r\nJansenists in France, but once he realised the dangerous nature of his\r\nopinions and the errors contained in such publications as the\r\n/Augustus/ of Jansen and the /Frequent Communion/ of Arnauld he threw\r\nhimself vigorously into the campaign against Jansenism. At court, in\r\nhis conferences with bishops and priests, in university circles, and\r\nin the seminaries he exposed the insidious character of its tenets. At\r\nRome he urged the authorities to have recourse to stern measures, and\r\nin France he strove hard to procure acceptance of the Roman decisions.\r\nAnd yet in all his work against the Jansenists there was nothing of\r\nthe bitterness of the controversialist. He could strike hard when he\r\nwished, but he never forgot that charity is a much more effective\r\nweapon than violence. In his own person he set the example of complete\r\nsubmission to the authority of the Pope, and enjoined such submission\r\non his successors. St. Vincent died in 1660. His loss was mourned not\r\nmerely by his own spiritual children, the Congregation of the Mission\r\nand the Sisters of Charity, but by the poor of Paris and of France to\r\nwhom he was a generous benefactor, as well as by the bishops and\r\nclergy to whom he had been a friend and a guide. To his influence more\r\nthan to any other cause is due the preservation of France to the\r\nChurch in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nBut the work of the Congregation of the Mission was not confined to\r\nFrance. Its disciples spread into Italy, Spain, Portugal, Poland,\r\nIreland, and England. They went as missionaries to Northern Africa to\r\nlabour among the Barbary pirates by whom St. Vincent had been\r\ncaptured, to Madagascar, to some of the Portuguese colonies in the\r\nEast, to China, and to the territories of the Sultan. At the\r\nRevolution most of their houses in France were destroyed, and many of\r\nthe Vincentians suffered martyrdom. When the worst storms, however,\r\nhad passed the congregation was re-established in France, and its\r\nmembers laboured earnestly in the spirit of its holy founder to\r\nrecover much of what had been lost.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the Sulpicians was Jean Jacques Olier[15] (1608-57) the\r\nfriend and disciple of St. Vincent de Paul. Impressed with the\r\nimportance of securing a good education and training for the clergy,\r\nhe and a couple of companions retired to a house in Vaugirard (1641),\r\nwhere they were joined by a few seminarists, who desired to place\r\nthemselves under his direction. Later on he was offered the parish of\r\nSt. Sulpice, then one of the worst parishes in Paris from the point of\r\nview of religion and morality. The little community of priests working\r\nunder the rules compiled by Olier for their guidance soon changed\r\ncompletely the face of the entire district. House to house visitations\r\nwere introduced; sermons suitable to the needs of the people were\r\ngiven; catechism classes were established, and in a very short time\r\nSt. Sulpice became the model parish of the capital.\r\n\r\nIn 1642 a little seminary was opened and rules were drawn up for the\r\ndirection of the students, most of whom attended the theological\r\nlectures at the Sorbonne. Priests and students formed one community,\r\nand as far as possible followed the same daily routine. During their\r\nfree time the students assisted in the work of the parish by visiting\r\nthe sick and taking charge of classes for catechism. At first Olier\r\nhad no intention of founding seminaries throughout France. His aim was\r\nrather to make St. Sulpice a national seminary, from which young\r\npriests might go forth properly equipped, and qualified to found\r\ndiocesan institutions on similar lines if their superiors favoured\r\nsuch an undertaking. But yielding to the earnest solicitations of\r\nseveral of the bishops he opened seminaries in several parts of\r\nFrance, and entrusted their administration to members of his own\r\ncommunity. The first of these was founded at Nantes in 1648. During\r\nthe lifetime of the founder a few of the Sulpicians were despatched to\r\nCanada, where they established themselves at Montreal, and laboured\r\nzealously for the conversion of the natives. Like St. Vincent, the\r\nfounder of the Sulpicians worked incessantly against Jansenism, and\r\nimpressed upon his followers the duty of prompt obedience to the\r\nbishops and to the Pope, lessons which they seem never to have\r\nforgotten. The Sulpicians according to their constitution are a\r\ncommunity of secular priests bound by no special religious vows.\r\n\r\nThe religious order, however, that did most to stem the advancing tide\r\nof heresy and to raise the drooping spirits of the Catholic body\r\nduring the saddest days of the sixteenth century was undoubtedly the\r\nSociety of Jesus, founded by St. Ignatius of Loyola.[16] By birth St.\r\nIgnatius was a Spaniard, and by profession he was a soldier. Having\r\nbeen wounded at the siege of Pampeluna in 1521 he turned his mind\r\nduring the period of his convalescence to the study of spiritual\r\nbooks, more particularly the Lives of the Saints. As he read of the\r\nstruggles some of these men had sustained and of the victories they\r\nhad achieved he realised that martial fame was but a shadow in\r\ncomparison with the glory of the saints, and he determined to desert\r\nthe army of Spain to enrol himself among the servants of Christ. With\r\nthe overthrow of the Moorish kingdom of Granada fresh in his mind, it\r\nis not strange that he should have dreamt of the still greater triumph\r\nthat might be secured by attacking the Mahomedans in the very seat of\r\ntheir power, and by inducing them to abandon the law of the Prophet\r\nfor the Gospel of the Christians. With the intention of preparing\r\nhimself for this work he bade good-bye to his friends and the\r\nassociations of his youth, and betook himself to a lonely retreat at\r\nManresa near Montserrat, where he gave himself up to meditation and\r\nprayer under the direction of a Benedictine monk. The result of his\r\nstay at Manresa and of his communings with God are to be seen in the\r\n/Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius/, a work which in the hands of\r\nhis disciples has done wonders for the conversion and perfection of\r\nsouls, and which in the opinion of those competent to judge has no\r\nserious rivals except the Bible and the Imitation of Christ. From\r\nManresa he journeyed to the Holy Land to visit its sacred shrines, and\r\nto labour for the conversion of the Infidel conquerors, but having\r\nfound it impossible to undertake this work at the time he returned to\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nRealising that his defective education was a serious obstacle to the\r\nestablishment of the religious order that he contemplated, he went to\r\nwork with a will to acquire the rudiments of grammar. When this had\r\nbeen accomplished successfully he pursued his higher studies at\r\nAlcala, Salamanca, and Paris, where he graduated as a doctor in 1534.\r\nBut while earnest in the pursuit of knowledge he never forgot that\r\nknowledge was but a means of preparing himself for the accomplishment\r\nof the mission to which God had called him. While at Paris he gathered\r\naround him a group of students, Francis Xavier, Lainez, Salmeron,\r\nBodadilla, Rodriguez and Faber, with which body Lejay, Codure and\r\nBroet were associated at a later period. On the feast of the\r\nAssumption (1534) Ignatius and his companions wended their way to the\r\nsummit of Montmartre overlooking the city of Paris, where having\r\nreceived Holy Communion they pledged themselves to labour in the Holy\r\nLand. Having discovered that this project was almost impossible they\r\ndetermined to place themselves at the disposal of the Pope. In Rome\r\nIgnatius explained the objects and rules of the proposed society to\r\nPaul III. and his advisers. In September 1540 the approval of the Pope\r\nwas obtained though with certain restrictions, which were abolished in\r\n1543, and in the following year Ignatius was elected first general of\r\nthe Society of Jesus.\r\n\r\nSt. Ignatius had the greatest respect for the older religious orders,\r\nthe Benedictines, the Dominicans, and the Franciscans, to all of which\r\nhe was deeply indebted; but he believed that the new conditions under\r\nwhich his followers would be called upon to do battle for Christ\r\nnecessitated new rules and a new constitution. The Society of Jesus\r\nwas not to be a contemplative order seeking only the salvation of its\r\nown members. Its energies were not to be confined to any particular\r\nchannel. No extraordinary fasts or austerities were imposed, nor was\r\nthe solemn chanting of the office or the use of a particular dress\r\ninsisted upon. The society was to work \"for the greater glory of God\"\r\nin whatever way the circumstances demanded. On one thing only did St.\r\nIgnatius lay peculiar emphasis, and that was the absolute necessity of\r\nobedience to superiors in all things lawful, and above all of\r\nobedience to the Pope. The wisdom of this injunction is evident enough\r\nat all times, but particularly in an age when religious authority,\r\neven that of the successor of St. Peter, was being called in question\r\nby so many. Members of the society were forbidden to seek or accept\r\nany ecclesiastical dignities or preferments.\r\n\r\nThe constitution[17] of the Society of Jesus was not drawn up with\r\nundue haste. St. Ignatius laid down rules for his followers, but it\r\nwas only when the value of these regulations had been tested by\r\npractice that he embodied them in the constitution, endorsed by the\r\nfirst general congregation held in 1558. According to the constitution\r\ncomplete administrative authority is vested in the general, who is\r\nelected by a general congregation, and holds office for life. He is\r\nassisted by a council consisting of a representative from each\r\nprovince. The provincials, rectors of colleges, heads of professed\r\nhouses, and masters of notices are appointed by the general, usually,\r\nhowever, only for a definite number of years, while all minor\r\nofficials are appointed by the provincial. The novitiate lasts for two\r\nyears during which time candidates for admission to the order are\r\nengaged almost entirely in prayer, meditation, and spiritual reading.\r\nWhen the novitiate has been completed the scholasticate begins.\r\nStudents are obliged to read a course in arts and philosophy and to\r\nteach in some of the colleges of the society, after which they proceed\r\nto the study of theology. When the theological course has been ended\r\nthey are admitted as coadjutors or professed members according to\r\ntheir ability and conduct. Between these two bodies, the coadjutors\r\nand the professed, there is very little difference, except that the\r\nprofessed in addition to the ordinary vows pledge themselves to go\r\nwherever the Pope may send them, and besides, it is from this body as\r\na rule that the higher officials of the order are selected. Lay\r\nbrothers are also attached to the society.\r\n\r\nWhen the Society of Jesus was founded, Protestantism had already made\r\ngreat strides in Northern Europe, and though the Latin countries were\r\nnot then affected no man could foresee what change a decade of years\r\nmight bring. St. Ignatius adopted the best precautions against the\r\nspread of heresy. While he himself remained in Rome engaged in\r\norganising the members of his society and in establishing colleges and\r\ncharitable institutions, he sent his followers to all parts of Italy.\r\nBishops availed themselves freely of their services as preachers and\r\nteachers. Colleges were opened in Venice, Naples, Bologna, Florence,\r\nand in many other leading cities. St. Charles Borromeo became the\r\npatron and defender of the society in Milan. Everywhere the labours of\r\nthe Jesuits led to a great religious revival, while by means of their\r\ncolleges they strengthened the faith of the rising generation. In\r\nSpain, too, the home of St. Ignatius the Jesuits received a friendly\r\nwelcome. Their colleges were crowded with students, as were their\r\nchurches with the faithful. Difficulties, indeed, arose owing to the\r\ntendency of some of the Spanish Jesuits to have none but Spanish\r\nsuperiors, but with a little prudence these difficulties were overcome\r\nin 1593. Most of the best known writers on ecclesiastical subjects,\r\nVasquez, Suarez, De Lugo, and Ripalda on Dogmatic Theology, Sanchez on\r\nMoral Theology, and Maldonatus and Pereira on Scripture belonged to\r\nthe Spanish province.\r\n\r\nIn France the society met with serious difficulties at first. Hatred\r\nof Spain and of everything that savoured of Spanish origin, dislike of\r\nwhat was considered the excessive loyalty of the society to the Pope,\r\nand jealousy on the part of the University of Paris were the principal\r\nobstacles that were to be overcome. But notwithstanding these the\r\nJesuits found a home in Paris, where they opened the College de\r\nClermont (Louis-le-Grand), and they founded similar colleges in\r\nseveral of the leading cities of France. In the struggle against the\r\nCalvinists they were of great assistance to the Catholic body. The\r\nprogress of their numerous colleges and the influence which they\r\nacquired over the young men roused the fierce opposition of the\r\nUniversity, but being befriended by the court, where they were\r\nretained as royal confessors, the Jesuits were enabled to hold their\r\nground. During the wars of the League against Henry III. and Henry of\r\nNavarre, though their position was one of extreme delicacy, the\r\nprudent action of their general, Aquaviva, in recommending his\r\nsubjects to respect the consciences of both parties saved the\r\nsituation. They were, however, expelled from Paris in 1594, but Henry\r\nIV. allowed them to return in 1603.\r\n\r\nIn the German States, Hungary, and Poland, where the fate of\r\nCatholicity seemed trembling in the balance, the Jesuit Fathers stayed\r\nwhat threatened to be a triumphal progress for Protestantism. St.\r\nIgnatius soon despatched some of his disciples to the scene of\r\nconflict under the leadership of the Blessed Peter Canisius.[18] By\r\nhis sermons, his lectures as professor, his prudent suggestions to\r\nthose in authority, as well as by his controversial writings, and more\r\nparticularly his celebrated Catechism, Canisius did more to stay the\r\nadvance of Protestantism in Germany than any single individual of his\r\nage. Colleges were founded in Vienna, Ingoldstadt, Treves, Mainz, and\r\nin most of the cities of Germany that were not subject to the\r\nProtestant princes. From these colleges went forth young men who were\r\ndetermined to resist the further encroachments of heresy. Maximilian\r\nof Bavaria and the Emperor Ferdinand II., both of whom took such a\r\nprominent part in the Catholic Counter-Reformation, were pupils of the\r\nJesuits, and were but types of the men who left their colleges. In\r\nHungary, too, and in Poland the tide was turned in favour of the\r\nCatholic Church mainly by the exertions of the Jesuits. In Ireland,\r\nEngland and Scotland, in the Netherlands, and Sweden, in a word\r\nwherever Catholic interests were endangered, the Jesuits risked their\r\nlives in defence of the Catholic religion. It is on account of the\r\ndefeats that they inflicted on heresy at this period that the hatred\r\nof the Jesuits is so deep-rooted and so universal amongst Protestants\r\neven to the present day.\r\n\r\nThe Ursulines, so called from their patron St. Ursula, began as a\r\nreligious association of pious ladies formed by Angela de' Merici[19]\r\n(Angela of Brescia) in 1537. At first the aim of the association was\r\nto reclaim fallen women, to visit the sick, and to educate the young.\r\nThe members lived in their own homes according to a scheme of life\r\ndrawn up for their guidance, meeting only for certain spiritual\r\nexercises. In 1535 the foundress succeeded in bringing a few of them\r\ntogether into a small community. After her death in 1540 the community\r\nincreased in numbers, and was approved by Paul III., who allowed the\r\nUrsulines to change their rules according to circumstances. For a long\r\ntime the Ursulines did not spread outside Brescia, but as their work\r\nbecame known, particularly their work as educationalists, they were\r\ninvited to other parts of Italy. In Milan they had a warm friend in\r\nthe person of its Cardinal Archbishop, St. Charles Borromeo. The first\r\ncommunity of the Ursulines was formed in France by Madame de Beuve. A\r\nrule was drawn up by Father Gonterey, S.J., and others of his society,\r\nand approved by Paul V. (1612). In a comparatively short time the\r\nUrsulines spread over most of the Catholic countries of Europe, so\r\nthat nearly all the most modern and best equipped schools for Catholic\r\ngirls were in their hands. In 1639 they went to Canada where they\r\nopened the convent known as the Hotel-Dieu at Quebec, and in 1727 they\r\nsettled in New Orleans.\r\n\r\nSt. Teresa[20] (1515-82) is the reformer rather than the foundress of\r\nthe Carmelite nuns. Being anxious from an early age to follow her\r\nreligious vocation, much against the wishes of her father she entered\r\nthe convent of the Carmelite nuns at Avila (1535). After her\r\nprofession she fell ill, and for years was subject to excruciating\r\ntorture. During this period she turned her mind completely to\r\nspiritual subjects, and was visited by God with most extraordinary\r\nmarks of divine favour, an account of which is to be found in her life\r\nwritten by herself, in her /Relations/, and in many other of her\r\nworks. She determined to return to the primitive austerity of the\r\nCarmelite rule, and in 1562 she founded the first convent of Discalced\r\nCarmelite nuns at Avila. Through her exertions other convents of the\r\norder adopted the reform, and in 1580 the existence of the Discalced\r\nCarmelites as a separate order was approved. She died in 1582, and\r\nforty years later she was canonised by Gregory XV.\r\n\r\nThe Sisters of the Visitation were established by St. Francis de\r\nSales[21] and St. Frances de Chantal.[22] St. Francis de Sales (1567-\r\n1622), so called from the castle of Sales in Savoy at which he was\r\nborn, made his rhetoric and philosophical studies at Paris under the\r\nJesuits. From Paris he went to Padua for law, and having received his\r\ndiploma he returned to his native country, where his father had\r\nsecured for him a place as senator and had arranged a very desirable\r\nmarriage. But St. Francis, feeling that he had been called by God to\r\nanother sphere of life, threw up his position at the bar, accepted the\r\noffice of provost of the chapter of Geneva, and received Holy Orders\r\n(1593). A great part of the diocese of Geneva was at this time overrun\r\nby the heretics. St. Francis threw himself with ardour into the work\r\nof converting those who had fallen away especially in the district of\r\nLe Chablais, where he won over thousands to the faith. He became\r\ncoadjutor-bishop of Geneva, and on the death of his friend Claude de\r\nGranier he was appointed to the See (1602). In conjunction with Madam\r\nde Chantal he established a community of women at Annecy in 1610. His\r\nidea at first was that the little community should not be bound by the\r\nenclosure, but should devote themselves to their own sanctification\r\nand to the visitation of the sick and the poor. Objections, however,\r\nhaving been raised against such an innovation, he drew up for the\r\ncommunity a rule based mainly on the rule of St. Augustine. In 1618\r\nthe society received recognition as a religious order under the title\r\nof the Order of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin. The order\r\nundertook the work of educating young girls as well as of visiting the\r\nsick. It spread rapidly in Italy, France, Germany, Poland, and later\r\non in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Sisters of Charity,[23] or the Grey Sisters as they were called,\r\nwere founded by St. Vincent de Paul. While St. Vincent was cure of\r\nChatillon-les-Dombes he established in the parish a confraternity of\r\ncharitable ladies for the care of the sick, the poor, and the orphans.\r\nThe experiment was so successful that he founded similar\r\nconfraternities in Paris, and wherever he gave missions throughout the\r\ncountry. Having found, however, that in Paris the ladies of charity\r\nwere accustomed to entrust the work to their servants he brought a\r\nnumber of young girls from the country, who could be relied upon to\r\ncarry out his wishes. These he looked after with a special solicitude,\r\nand in 1633 Madam Le Gras took a house in Paris, where she brought\r\ntogether a few of the most promising of them to form a little\r\ncommunity. In 1642 after the community had moved into a house opposite\r\nSt. Lazare, some of the sisters were allowed to take vows. The Sisters\r\nof Charity have been at all times exceedingly popular in France. By\r\ntheir schools, their orphanages, their hospitals, and by their\r\nkindness to the poor and the suffering they won for themselves a place\r\nin the hearts of the French people. For a while during the worst days\r\nof the Revolution their work was suspended, and their communities were\r\ndisbanded; but their suppression was deplored so generally that in\r\n1801 the Superioress was commanded to re-organise the society. Outside\r\nFrance the Sisters of Charity had several houses in Poland,\r\nSwitzerland, Spain, and Germany.\r\n\r\nMary Ward[24] (1585-1645) was born of a good Catholic family in\r\nEngland. She joined the Poor Clares at St. Omer in 1600, but,\r\npreferring an active to a contemplative life, she gathered around her\r\na few companions, and formed a little community at St. Omer mainly for\r\nthe work of education. According to her plan, which was derived in\r\ngreat measure from the constitution of the Society of Jesus (hence the\r\nname Jesuitesses given to her followers by her opponents), her sisters\r\nwere not bound by the enclosure, were not to wear any distinctive\r\ndress, and were to be subject directly only to Rome. Serious\r\nobjections were raised immediately against such an institute,\r\nparticularly as Pius V. had declared expressly that the enclosure and\r\nsolemn vows were essential conditions for the recognition of religious\r\ncommunities of women. Branches were opened in the Netherlands,\r\nAustria, and Italy under the patronage of the highest civil\r\nauthorities. As the opponents of the community continued their attacks\r\nthe foundress was summoned to Rome to make her defence (1629), but in\r\nthe following year the decree of suppression was issued. The house in\r\nMunich was allowed to continue, and at the advice of the Pope she\r\nopened a house in Rome. The principal change introduced was that the\r\nhouses should be subject to the bishops of the dioceses in which they\r\nwere situated. At last in 1703, on the petition of Maximilian Emanuel\r\nof Bavaria and of Mary the wife of James II., the rule was approved\r\nformally by Clement XI. The society continued to spread especially in\r\nBavaria. The followers of Mary Ward are designated variously, the\r\nInstitute of Mary, Englische Fraulein, and Loreto Nuns from the name\r\ngiven to Rathfarnham, the mother-house of the Irish branch, founded by\r\nFrances Ball in 1821.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] /Histoire du Ven Didier de la Cour, reformateur des Benedictins/,\r\n    1772.\r\n\r\n[2] De Lama, /Bibliotheque des ecrivains de la congregation de St.\r\n    Maur/, 1882.\r\n\r\n[3] Da Forli, /Annali Cappuccini/, 1882.\r\n\r\n[4] Dumortier, /Saint Gaetan di Thiene/, 1882.\r\n\r\n[5] Dubois, /Le bienheureux A.

(chap.\r\n  iii.).\r\n\r\nThe Religious Peace of Augsburg (1555) did not put an end to the\r\nstruggle between the Catholics and Protestants in Germany. Feeling on\r\nboth sides was too intense to permit either party to be satisfied with\r\nthe arrangement or to accept it as a permanent definition of their\r\nrespective rights. The German Catholics were indignant that a party\r\nthat had sprung up so recently and that had done such injury to their\r\nChurch and country, should be rewarded for heresy and disloyalty to\r\nthe Emperor by such concessions. Nor was their indignation likely to\r\nbe appeased by the manner in which Lutheran and Calvinist preachers\r\ncaricatured and denounced the doctrines and practices of the Catholic\r\nworld. Possibly it was, however, the clause of the Augsburg Peace\r\nknown as the /Ecclesiasticum Reservatum/ that gave rise to the most\r\nheated controversies, and played the greatest part in bringing about\r\ncivil war. By this clause it was provided that in case any of the\r\nbishops and abbots passed over to the reformed religion they could not\r\nbring with them the ecclesiastical property attached to their office.\r\nThe Lutherans, who had benefited so largely by such secessions from\r\nthe Church in the past, objected to this clause at the Diet, and\r\nprotested against the decision when their objections were overruled.\r\n\r\nHaving realised that the Emperor was unable or unwilling to prevent\r\nthem they continued to act in open defiance of the /Ecclesiasticam\r\nReservatum/. Where the territories of a Catholic bishop were situated\r\nin close proximity to the states of Protestant princes recourse was\r\nhad to various devices to acquire the lands of the Church. Sometimes\r\nthe bishop was induced to surrender them in return for a fixed grant\r\nor pension, sometimes the chapter was persuaded to elect as bishop\r\nsome scion of a princely family, who was well-known to have leanings\r\ntowards Protestantism, and in a few cases the bishops themselves\r\nsolved the problem by seceding from the Catholic Church while\r\ncontinuing to administer the territories to which their episcopal\r\noffice was their only title. In this way two archbishoprics and\r\nfourteen bishoprics, amongst them being such wealthy Sees as\r\nMagdeburg, Bremen, Brandenburg, and Osnabruck had passed into the\r\nhands of the Lutherans, and it required a very special effort to\r\nprevent two such important centres as Cologne and Aachen from meeting\r\nwith a similar fate. Gebhard, Archbishop of Cologne, a man of\r\nscandalously immoral life, completed his infamous career by taking as\r\nhis wife one who had been his concubine, announcing at the same time\r\nthat he had gone over to Calvinism. The chapter of Cologne Cathedral\r\nbacked by the people took steps to rid themselves of such a superior,\r\nand the chapter was supported warmly by both Pope and Emperor. Gebhard\r\nwas obliged to escape to Strassburg in the cathedral of which he held\r\na canonry, and where he succeeded in creating confusion. Two\r\narchbishops claimed the See of Strassburg, one loyal to the Catholic\r\nChurch and one favouring Protestantism. This disgraceful contention\r\nwent on for years, till at last the Protestant champion was induced to\r\nsurrender on the payment of a large composition. The See of Aachen was\r\nseized by force in 1581, and was held for fifteen years, at the end of\r\nwhich the Protestants were obliged to abandon their claims.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the Catholics the Emperors who succeeded Charles V.\r\nwere not strong enough to deal with such a dangerous situation.\r\nFerdinand I., sincere Catholic though he was, mindful of the terrible\r\ndisasters brought upon his country by the religious wars, strove with\r\nall his might against their renewal. His successor Maximilian II.\r\n(1564-76) was so strongly inclined towards Protestantism that he made\r\nmany concessions to the Protestants even in his own hereditary\r\ndominions. He invited distinguished Lutheran preachers to Vienna,\r\nconferred on Protestants influential positions at court, and gave\r\npermission for Protestant religious services at least to the nobles of\r\nBohemia, Silesia, and Hungary. Several of the prince-bishops anxious\r\nto stand well with the Emperor attempted to introduce reforms in\r\nCatholic liturgy and Catholic practices without any reference to the\r\nHoly See. The alarming spread of Protestantism in Austria, Hungary,\r\nBohemia, and Silesia, fostered as it was by the general policy of the\r\nEmperor, tended to make the position of the Catholic Church extremely\r\ninsecure.[1]\r\n\r\nBut fortunately at that time a strong Catholic reaction began to make\r\nitself felt. The reforming decrees of the Council of Trent did not\r\nfail to produce a decided improvement in the condition of the bishops\r\nand clergy. The new religious orders, particularly the Jesuits, had\r\nthrown themselves into the work of defending the Catholic position,\r\nand the colleges established by the Jesuits were turning out the\r\nyounger generation of Catholics well-equipped for the struggle that\r\nlay before them. The catechisms which the Jesuit preachers scattered\r\nbroadcast through the country, and the attention paid by them to the\r\nproper religious instruction of the people helped to remove the bad\r\nimpressions produced by the misrepresentations of the Lutherans, and\r\ntended to arouse a strong, healthy, educated Catholic opinion in\r\npublic life. Fortunately, too, at the time when the Emperors were a\r\ndanger rather than a protection to the Church, the rules of Bavaria\r\nundertook boldly the defence of the old religion, and placed\r\nthemselves at the head of the Catholic forces.[2] Albert V. (1550-79)\r\ninsisted on the promulgation of the decrees of the Council of Trent,\r\nand made an oath of loyalty to the Catholic Church an indispensable\r\ncondition for office in his kingdom. He favoured the Jesuits,\r\nencouraged their schools, and did everything in his power to\r\nstrengthen Catholicism amongst his subjects. His policy was continued\r\nby Maximilian I. (1598-1651), who became the recognised leader of the\r\nadvanced Catholic party in Germany.\r\n\r\nThis general unexpected revival, the success of which was shown by the\r\nfervour of the people, the unwillingness of the authorities to make\r\nany further concessions, and the determination of all parties to\r\ninsist on the strict observance of the /Ecclesiasticum Reservatum/\r\nfilled the Protestants with such alarm that their princes began to\r\ninsist on new guarantees. The Emperor, Rudolph II. (1576-1612),\r\nthough, unlike his predecessor, a good Catholic, was a most\r\nincompetent ruler, devoting most of his time to alchemy and other such\r\nstudies rather than to the work of government. He endeavoured to solve\r\nthe religious difficulties in Silesia and Bohemia by yielding to the\r\nProtestant demands (1609), but the interference of his brother\r\nMatthias led to new complications, and finally to Rudolph's abdication\r\nof the sovereignty of Bohemia (1611). Frederick IV. of the Palatinate\r\nwas a strong Protestant, and was closely connected with the reforming\r\nparty in England, Holland, and France. He thought he saw in the strife\r\nbetween the members of the House of Habsburg an opportunity of\r\nimproving the position of Protestantism in the empire, of weakening\r\nthe claims of the House of Habsburg to the imperial dignity, and\r\npossibly also of establishing himself as ruler of a united Germany.\r\n\r\nAn incident that took place at Donauworth,[3] a city near the Rhine,\r\nhelped him to realise his scheme of a great Protestant federation.\r\nThis city was almost exclusively Catholic in 1555, but in one way or\r\nanother the Protestants had succeeded in improving their position till\r\nat last only the abbey church remained to the Catholics. Here on the\r\nFeast of Corpus Christi in the year 1606 the customary procession of\r\nthe Blessed Sacrament was attacked and dispersed, and the Catholics\r\nwere treated with the greatest cruelty. When the matter was brought\r\nbefore the Emperor the city was placed under the ban of the empire,\r\nand Maximilian I. of Bavaria was entrusted with the task of carrying\r\nout the decree. He advanced with a strong army and captured the city.\r\nAs the war indemnity could not be raised he retained possession of it,\r\nrestoring to the Catholics everything they had lost. Frederick IV.\r\nmade a strong appeal to the Protestant princes to show their\r\nresentment at such an act of aggression, pointing out to them that the\r\nfate of Donauworth would be the fate of all their territories unless\r\nthey took united action. As a consequence when both parties met at the\r\nDiet of Regensburg (1608) the excitement was intense, and when the\r\nEmperor appealed to his princes for support against the Turks, the\r\nProtestants refused to lend their aid unless they received\r\nsatisfactory explanations. The Catholics, encouraged by Maximilian,\r\nwere equally unconciliatory, with the result that the Diet disbanded\r\nwithout having been able to arrive at an agreement.\r\n\r\nA short time after the Diet most of the Protestant princes met at\r\nAhausen and formed a confederation known as the /Union/ (1608) at the\r\nhead of which stood Frederick IV. of the Palatinate, while a little\r\nlater a large number of the Catholic princes bound themselves together\r\nin the /League/ and accepted Maximilian of Bavaria as their leader\r\n(1609). Thus Germany was divided once again into two hostile camps,\r\nand only a very trifling incident was required to plunge the country\r\ninto another civil war. For a time it seemed as if the succession to\r\nthe Duchy of Cleves was to be the issue that would lead to the\r\ncatastrophe. Duke John William of Cleves had died without any direct\r\nheir, and as the religious issue was still undecided in his territory,\r\nthe appointment of a successor was a matter of the greatest importance\r\nto both parties. The Emperor with the approval of the /League/\r\nnominated his brother Leopold as administrator, while the /Union/,\r\nhaving strengthened itself by an alliance with France, was prepared to\r\ntake the field in favour of a Protestant. Henry IV. of France, anxious\r\nto turn the disputes that had broken out between the different members\r\nof the imperial family to the advantage of himself and his country,\r\nwas actually on his way to take part in the campaign when he was\r\nassassinated. On his death both parties agreed to a temporary truce\r\n(1610), and thus the outbreak of the war was delayed for some time.\r\n\r\nThis delay was very fortunate for the Catholics in Germany. With such\r\nan Emperor as Rudolph pitted against a man like Henry IV. there could\r\nhave been very little doubt about the issue. Even in his own\r\nterritories Rudolph could not maintain his authority against his\r\nbrother Matthias, in whose interest he was obliged to abdicate the\r\nthrone of Bohemia (1611). On the death of Rudolph (1612) Matthias\r\nsucceeded though not without considerable difficulty. As Emperor he\r\nshowed himself much less favourable to the Protestants than he had\r\nbeen during the years when he was disputing with his brother, but,\r\nhowever well inclined, he was powerless to put an end to the division\r\nthat existed or to control the policy of the /League/ or the /Union/.\r\nThe Duchy of Cleves was still an object of dispute. While the German\r\nProtestants invoked the aid of William of Orange and the Dutch\r\nCalvinists, the Catholics called in the forces of Spain. The Emperor\r\ncould merely look on while his subjects allied themselves with\r\nforeigners to settle their own domestic troubles.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile far more serious trouble was brewing in Bohemia, where the\r\nfollowers of Hus had blended with the disciples of Luther, and where\r\nin many centres there was a strong feeling against the Catholic\r\nChurch. According to the concessions granted by Rudolph (1609),\r\nknights and free cities were at liberty to build Protestant churches,\r\nbut a similar concession was not made to the subjects of Catholic\r\nlords. Regardless of or misinterpreting the terms of the concession,\r\nhowever, the Protestant tenants of the Archbishop of Prague and of the\r\nAbbot of Braunau built churches for their own use. The archbishop and\r\nabbot, considering themselves aggrieved, appealed to the imperial\r\ncourt. According to the decision of this court the church built on the\r\nlands of the archbishop was to be pulled down, and the other on the\r\nlands of the abbot was to be closed (1618). A deputation representing\r\nthe Protestant party was appointed to interview the imperial\r\nrepresentatives at Prague, and the reply to their remonstrances being\r\nregarded as unfavourable, the mob attacked the building, and hurled\r\nthe councillors who were supposed to be responsible for it through the\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nUnder the direction of Count Thurn and some other Protestant nobles a\r\nprovisional government was established in Bohemia, arrangements were\r\nmade to organise an army, and as a beginning in the work of reform the\r\nJesuits were expelled. Owing to the strong anti-German feeling of the\r\npopulace the rebellion spread rapidly in Bohemia, and Count Mansfeld\r\nhastened to the relief of the insurgents with an army placed at his\r\ndisposal by the /Union/. Most of the cities of Bohemia were captured\r\nby the rebels, and the whole of northern Austria stood in the gravest\r\ndanger. At this critical moment the Emperor Matthias passed away, and\r\nwas succeeded by Ferdinand II. (1619-37). The latter was a devoted\r\nCatholic, trained by the Jesuits, and had already done immense service\r\nto the Church by wiping out almost every trace of heresy in his\r\nhereditary dominions. That such a man should succeed to the imperial\r\ndignity at such a time was highly distasteful to the Protestants of\r\nBohemia. It was not, therefore, to be wondered at that they refused to\r\nacknowledge him as king, and elected in his stead Frederick V. of the\r\nPalatinate (1619).\r\n\r\nThe situation looked exceedingly serious for Ferdinand II. On the one\r\nside he was being pressed hard by the Turks, and on the other he was\r\nbeset so closely by the Bohemian rebels that even the very city of\r\nVienna was in danger of falling into their hands. His opponent\r\nFrederick V. could rely upon the forces of the /Union/ in the\r\ncampaign, and besides, as the son-in-law of James I. of England and\r\nthe nephew of Maurice of Orange the successful leader of the Dutch and\r\nthe sworn ally of the French Huguenots, Frederick had little\r\ndifficulty in persuading himself that at last Europe was to be freed\r\nfrom the domination of the House of Habsburg. He marched into Bohemia,\r\nand was crowned solemnly at Prague in 1619. But if Frederick could\r\ncount upon support from many quarters so, too, could Ferdinand.\r\nMaximilian II. of Bavaria was active on his side, as were indeed the\r\nwhole forces of the /League/. Saxony, too, which was devoted to\r\nLutheranism and detested the Calvinist tendencies of Frederick,\r\nfearing that a victory for him might mean a victory for Calvinism,\r\nranged itself under the banner of the Emperor. The Pope sent generous\r\nsubsidies, as did also Spain. Finally, during the course of the\r\ncampaign Ferdinand was fortunate in having the service of two of the\r\nablest generals of their time, Tilly,[4] who commanded the forces of\r\nthe /League/, and Wallenstein[5] who had charge of the imperial\r\ntroops. Maximilian of Bavaria marched into Austria at the head of the\r\narmy of the /League/ and drove the rebels back into Bohemia, whither\r\nhe followed them, and inflicted upon them a severe defeat in the\r\nbattle of the White Mountain (1620). Frederick was obliged to save\r\nhimself by flight after a reign of a few months. The leaders of the\r\nrebellion were arrested and put to death. In return for the services\r\nhe had rendered Maximilian of Bavaria became ruler of the Palatinate,\r\nfrom which Frederick had been deposed. But though Frederick was\r\ndefeated the struggle was by no means finished. The Count of Mansfeld,\r\nacting on behalf of the /Union/, espoused the cause of the Palgrave\r\nand was supported by an army led by Christian IV. of Denmark,\r\nFrederick's brother-in-law, who marched into Germany to the aid of his\r\nfriends. James I. of England, though unwilling to despatch an army,\r\nhelped by grants of money. The war was renewed with great vigour, but\r\nthe allies had little chance of success against two such experienced\r\ngenerals as Tilly and Wallenstein. Christian IV. suffered a terrible\r\ndefeat at the Barenberg near Lutter (1626), and three years later he\r\nwas forced to agree to the Peace of Lubeck (1629), by which he\r\npromised to withdraw from Germany and never again to mix himself up in\r\nits domestic affairs.\r\n\r\nThe forces of the Emperor and of the /League/ were so victorious all\r\nalong the line that the former felt himself strong enough to deal with\r\nthe burning question of the ecclesiastical property that had been\r\nseized. In a short time he issued what is known as the /Edict of\r\nRestitution/ (1629), by which he ordered that all property acquired by\r\nthe Protestants contrary to the /Ecclesiasticum Reservatum/ clause of\r\nthe Peace of Augsburg (1555) should be restored. He commanded,\r\nbesides, that the terms of the Peace of Passau-Augsburg should be\r\nstrictly observed, allowed Catholic and Protestant princes the right\r\nof establishing their own religion in their own territories (/Cuius\r\nregio illius religio/), and permitted Protestant subjects of Catholic\r\nprinces who felt their consciences aggrieved to emigrate if they\r\nwished to do so. About the justice of this decree there could be very\r\nlittle dispute, for it dealt only with the return of what had been\r\nacquired by open or veiled spoliation, but it may well be doubted\r\nwhether it was prudent considering the circumstances of the case. In\r\nthe first place, it meant the loss of enormous territories for some of\r\nthe Protestant princes who had enriched themselves from the lands of\r\nthe bishops and abbots. During the earlier stages of the war many of\r\nthose men had stood loyally by the Emperor in his struggle against\r\nrebels and foreign invaders, but now, mindful of their own temporal\r\ninterests and the future of their religion, they were prepared to\r\nrange themselves on the side of their co-religionists in what had\r\nbecome purely a religious war. France, too, alarmed by the victory of\r\nFerdinand II., and fearing that a victory for the House of Habsburg\r\nmight lead to the establishment of a united empire and the indefinite\r\npostponement of the project of securing for France the provinces along\r\nthe Rhine, was only too glad to pledge its support to the Protestant\r\nprinces in the war against the Emperor. The young and valiant king of\r\nSweden, Gustavus Adolphus,[6] was a keen spectator of the trend of\r\naffairs in Germany, and was anxious to secure for his country the\r\nGerman provinces along the shores of the Baltic. He was not without\r\nhopes also that, by putting himself forward as the champion of\r\nProtestantism and by helping the Protestant princes to overthrow the\r\nHouse of Habsburg, he might set up for himself on the ruins of the\r\nHoly Roman Empire a great Protestant confederacy embracing most of\r\nNorthern Europe. Finally, even though Saxony had been induced by\r\nspecial concessions to accept the Edict of Restitution, it might have\r\nbeen anticipated that in a purely religious struggle between Catholics\r\nand Protestants hatred of the Roman Church would prove stronger than\r\nthe prejudices against Geneva, and its ruler would be forced to join\r\nthe enemies of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nGustavus Adolphus, having strengthened himself by a formal agreement\r\nwith France, marched into Germany at the head of a body of picked\r\ntroops (1630). He issued a proclamation announcing that he had come to\r\nfree the Germans from slavery, and he opened negotiations with the\r\nProtestant princes, some of whom to do them justice showed themselves\r\nvery reluctant to become allies of a foreign invader. Ferdinand II.\r\nwas but poorly prepared to meet such an attack. The imperial troops\r\nhad been disbanded, and what was much worse, Wallenstein had retired\r\ninto private life. Many of the Catholic princes, notably Maximilian of\r\nBavaria, resented his rapid promotion and the grant that had been made\r\nto him of the Duchy of Mecklenburg. They prejudiced the mind of\r\nFerdinand against him just at the time his services were most urgently\r\nrequired. Nor, when the first fit of zeal had passed away, were all\r\nthe Catholic princes anxious to hasten to the support of the Emperor.\r\nTilly with the forces of the /League/ advanced to bar the progress of\r\nthe Swedes. He was defeated at Breitenfeld (1631) and his army was\r\nnearly destroyed. Gustavus Adolphus pushed rapidly forward towards\r\nBavaria, captured the cities of Wurzburg, Mainz, and Augsburg, and for\r\na time it seemed as if his advance to Vienna was going to be a\r\ntriumphal march. Over-joyed with the success of his campaign he began\r\nto act as if he were really emperor of Germany, thereby giving great\r\noffence to many of his German followers. His dreams of power were,\r\nhowever, brought to an abrupt termination. In April 1632 he fought an\r\nindecisive battle at Rain on the Lech, where Tilly was wounded\r\nmortally, but in November he was slain at Lutzen though his army was\r\nvictorious.\r\n\r\nFerdinand found himself in great danger. He appealed for aid to Urban\r\nVIII. and to Spain but at first the former, believing that the\r\nstruggle was more political than religious, refused to assist him,\r\nthough later on, when he realised that the very existence of the\r\nCatholic Church in the empire was endangered, he changed his mind and\r\nforwarded generous subsidies. Maximilian of Bavaria, who had held\r\naloof for a time, espoused warmly the cause of the Emperor, and\r\nWallenstein, who had been recalled in the hour of danger, raised an\r\nimmense army in an incredibly short space of time. Oxenstierna, the\r\nchancellor of Sweden, took up the work of his master Adolphus and\r\nsucceeded in bringing about an alliance with the Protestant princes\r\n(1633). So low had the national feeling sunk in the empire that the\r\nProtestant princes consented to appoint this upstart as director of\r\nthe campaign and to fight under his command. France supplied the funds\r\nto enable the Swedes to carry on the war. For some time very little\r\nwas done on either side. Negotiations were carried on by Wallenstein\r\nwith the Swedes, with Saxony, and with France. It was represented to\r\nthe Emperor that his chosen general was guilty of gross disloyalty.\r\nThough the charge of absolute disloyalty has not been proved, still\r\ncertain actions of Wallenstein coupled with his inactivity gave good\r\ncolour to the accusation. The Emperor dismissed him from his command,\r\nand a little later he was murdered by some of his own soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe war and the negotiations were renewed alternately, but without any\r\nresult as peace was not desired by either Sweden or France. At last\r\nthe forces of the Emperor gained a signal victory at Nordlingen\r\n(1634). This success had at least one good result in that it detached\r\nthe Elector of Saxony from the side of Sweden. He had never thrown\r\nhimself whole-heartedly into the struggle, as he disliked the idea of\r\nsupporting a foreign invader against his own Emperor, and was not\r\nsorry to escape from a very awkward position. The Peace of Prague was\r\nconcluded between the Emperor and Saxony (1635), according to which\r\nthe Edict of Restitution was abandoned in great measure, and religious\r\nfreedom was guaranteed to the Protestants of Silesia.\r\n\r\nBut to promote their own interests the Swedes and the French insisted\r\non complete equality between the Protestants and Catholics as an\r\nindispensable condition for peace. From this time onward it was a\r\npurely political struggle, inspired solely by the desire of these two\r\ncountries to weaken Germany and to break the power of the House of\r\nHabsburg. On the death of Ferdinand II. in 1637 it was thought that\r\nthe war might have been ended, but these hopes were disappointed.\r\nFerdinand III. (1637-57) who succeeded offered a general amnesty at\r\nthe Diet of Regensburg (1641) without avail. French soldiers crossed\r\nthe frontiers to support the Swedes and the Protestants. Finally after\r\nlong negotiations the Peace of Westphalia (1648) put an end to a\r\nstruggle, in which Germany had suffered enormously, and from which\r\nforeigners were to derive the greatest benefits.\r\n\r\nThe Peace of Westphalia was dictated to Germany by France and Sweden.\r\nAs a reward for the injury they had inflicted on the country both\r\nreceived large slices of German territory. France insisted on getting\r\npossession of Alsace, while Sweden received large grants of territory\r\nalong the Baltic together with a war indemnity of five million\r\nthalers. In order to provide compensation for the secular princes,\r\nportion of whose territories had been ceded to these two powers, and\r\nalso to reward others who had suffered for their alliance with Sweden,\r\nthe secularisation of a considerable amount of the ecclesiastical\r\nstates was arranged. Saxony, Brandenburg, Hesse-Cassel, Brunswick, and\r\nMecklenburg were enriched by the acquisition of lands formerly ruled\r\nover by the bishops and abbots. This step meant that the Protestant\r\nstates of Germany were strengthened at the expense of the Catholic\r\nChurch, and that the people of these districts being now transferred\r\nto Protestant rulers were in great danger of being drawn over to the\r\nreligion of their new masters. The jurisdiction of the bishops was\r\nabolished in these territories, and even in some of the new chapters,\r\nas for example at Osnabruck, Protestant canons were installed side by\r\nside with Catholics.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it was arranged that the terms of the Peace of Augsburg\r\nshould be observed, with this important change, that the rights\r\nguaranteed in it to the Lutherans should be extended even to those who\r\ndid not accept the Augsburg Confession. This concession was intended\r\nto meet the demands of the Calvinists. Again, complete equality was\r\nestablished between Catholics and Protestants in the empire. To give\r\neffect to this clause it was arranged that in all imperial committees\r\nand courts both parties should be represented in equal numbers. In\r\ncase religious issues were discussed at the Diet, where the Catholics\r\nstill had the majority, it was agreed that the matter should not be\r\ndecided by voting but by friendly compromise. The princes were\r\npermitted to determine the religion of their subjects, the principal\r\nrestriction being that those subjects who were in the enjoyment of a\r\ncertain form of public or private religious worship in 1624 should not\r\nbe forced to change their religion. For the others nothing remained\r\nbut to seek a home where their conscientious convictions might be\r\nrespected. In regard to ecclesiastical property the year 1624 was\r\ntaken as the normal year, the property that the Protestants held in\r\nthat year being allowed to remain in their hands. The /Ecclesiasticum\r\nReservatum/ clause was retained, and made obligatory on both parties.\r\nThese terms, it was provided, should not extend to the Protestants in\r\nthe hereditary dominions of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe Peace of Westphalia by its practical recognition of state\r\nneutrality in religious matters put an end to the constitution of the\r\nHoly Roman Empire, and reduced the Emperor to the position of a mere\r\nfigurehead, depending for strength entirely on his own hereditary\r\nstates. Instead of preventing disunion it made national unity almost\r\nimpossible, and exposed Germany to attack from any hostile neighbour\r\nwho might wish to strengthen himself by encouraging strife amongst its\r\nvarious states. Besides, it inflicted a severe injury on the Church\r\nnot merely by its recognition of the Protestant religion, but by the\r\nseizure of ecclesiastical property, the abolition of bishoprics, the\r\ninterference with cathedral chapters, and the recognition of the right\r\nof the temporal sovereign to determine the religion of his subjects.\r\nIt was no wonder then that the papal legate Fabio Chigi lodged a\r\nstrong protest against the Peace, and that the protest was renewed in\r\nthe most solemn form by Innocent X. (1648).[7] This action was not\r\ninspired by the Pope's opposition to peace. On the contrary, again and\r\nagain during the civil war the Holy See had sought to bring about a\r\nfriendly understanding, but no Pope, unless he was disloyal to the\r\ntrust confided in him, could permit such interference in purely\r\nreligious matters without making it clear that he was not a consenting\r\nparty. Innocent X. foresaw that this was but the herald of new claims\r\non the part of the civil rulers, and that in a short time even the\r\nCatholic sovereigns would endeavour to regulate the ecclesiastical\r\naffairs of their subjects without reference to the authority of the\r\nChurch. Nor was it long until events showed that his suspicions were\r\nnot without good foundation.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] Losche, /Geschichte des Protestantismus in Osterreich/, 1902.\r\n\r\n[2] Hartmann, /Der Prozess gegen die Protestantischen Landstande in\r\n    Bayern unter Albrecht V./, 1904.\r\n\r\n[3] Stieve, /Der Kampf um Donauworth/, 1875.\r\n\r\n[4] Villermont, /Tilly ou la guerre de trente ans/, 1860.\r\n\r\n[5] Halwich, /Geschichte Wallensteins/, 1910.\r\n\r\n[6] Gfrofer, /Gustav.

Werner,\r\n  /Missionsatlas/, 1885.\r\n\r\nWhile heresy was spreading with such alarming rapidity that it\r\nthreatened to deprive the Church of her fairest provinces in Europe,\r\nnew continents were being opened up in the East and the West, and\r\nChristian missionaries were being sent forth to bear an invitation to\r\nstrange races and peoples to take the place of the millions who had\r\nstrayed from the fold. The restless energy and activity so\r\ncharacteristic of the fifteenth century manifested itself strikingly\r\nin the numerous naval expeditions, planned and carried out in face of\r\nenormous difficulties, and which led to such important geographical\r\ndiscoveries. The Portuguese pushed forward their discoveries along the\r\nwest coast of Africa till at last Bartholomew Diaz succeeded in\r\ndoubling the Cape of Good Hope (1487), thereby opening the way for\r\nVasco de Gama's voyage to the Malabar coast in 1498. Spain, jealous of\r\nthe new south sea route to the East Indies discovered by her rival,\r\navailed herself of the offer of Christopher Columbus to provide a\r\nwestern route, and it was while engaged in this attempt that he\r\ndiscovered the great continent of America. The importance of these\r\ndiscoveries in both East and West both from the spiritual and temporal\r\npoint of view was understood clearly enough by both Spain and\r\nPortugal. The rulers of these countries, while anxious for the spread\r\nof Christianity among the pagan races of Asia and America, were not\r\nunmindful also of the important service that might be rendered by\r\nreligion to their work of colonisation. Fortunately these new fields\r\nfor the Christian missionaries were opened up, at a time when the\r\nreligious spirit of Western Europe was beginning to recover from the\r\nstate of lethargy to which it had been reduced by abuses, and the cry\r\nwent forth for volunteers in an age when the older religious orders\r\nhad begun to feel the influence of reform, and when the new religious\r\norders, particularly the Jesuits, were at hand to render invaluable\r\nassistance. The foundation of the Congregation /De Propaganda Fide/\r\n(1622), the establishment of the /Collegium Urbanum/ (1627) for the\r\neducation and training of missionary priests, and the organisation of\r\nthe /Societe des Missions Etrangeres/[1] (1663) in Paris helped to\r\nunify the work and to put it upon a solid and permanent basis.\r\n\r\nThe first place in this remarkable missionary development must be\r\nassigned to St. Francis Xavier[2] (1506-52), the friend and disciple\r\nof St. Ignatius of Loyola, and the most successful Christian\r\nmissionary since the days of St. Paul. On the invitation of John III.\r\nof Portugal, who had heard something about the contemplated new\r\nSociety of Jesus, St. Francis sailed from Lisbon, and landed at Goa,\r\nthe capital of the Portuguese Indian colony (1542). Franciscans and\r\nDominicans had preceded him thither, but the scandalous example of\r\nirreligion and immorality set by the colonists had made it nearly\r\nimpossible for these devoted men to win converts amongst the pagan\r\nraces. St. Francis threw himself generously into the work of\r\nre-awakening the faith of the Portuguese before attempting the\r\nconversion of the natives. When the condition of affairs in Goa had\r\nundergone a complete change for the better, he set out for West India,\r\nwhere he preached with wonderful effect, and succeeded in extending\r\nhis efforts as far as the Island of Ceylon. He next visited Malacca,\r\nthe Molucca Islands and Sumatra. Everywhere he went he won thousands\r\nto the faith. His extraordinary kindness and charity, his untiring\r\nzeal, his simple straightforward exposition of Catholic doctrine, and\r\nthe numerous miracles by which God confirmed the truth of his\r\npreaching, were the principal causes of his success. In the meantime\r\nseveral other members of the Society of Jesus had arrived. These he\r\ndespatched to different parts of India to tend the flock whom he had\r\nwon for Christ, while at the same time he established a novitiate and\r\na house of studies to prepare a native clergy for carrying on the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nNot content with what had been accomplished in India he set out for\r\nJapan (1549) in company with a Japanese convert, who assisted him to\r\nacquire a knowledge of the language. He landed at Kagoshima, where he\r\nremained nearly a year learning the language and preparing a short\r\ntreatise in Japanese on the principal articles of faith. When he had\r\novercome these preliminary difficulties he began the work of\r\nevangelisation, and notwithstanding the energetic opposition of the\r\nbonzes or native priests he formed a flourishing community. Through\r\ncentral Japan he made his way preaching with success in the principal\r\ntowns, but the political troubles then raging in the capital proved a\r\nserious obstacle to the success of his work. For two years and a half\r\nSt. Francis continued his apostolic labours in Japan, and then\r\nreturned to Goa, not indeed to rest but only to prepare for a still\r\nmore hazardous mission. In Japan he discovered that one of the\r\nprincipal arguments used against the acceptance of the Christian faith\r\nwas the fact that the Chinese, to whom the people of Japan looked with\r\nreverence, still preferred Confucius to Christ. Inspired by the hope\r\nof securing the Celestial Empire for the Church, and of ensuring\r\nthereby the conversion of the entire Eastern races, he had himself\r\nappointed ambassador to China and set off to reach the capital. On the\r\nvoyage, however, he became to seriously ill that it was necessary to\r\nland him on the little island of Sancian, where in a rude hut\r\nconstructed to shelter him he breathed his last. During the ten years\r\nof his mission he had won close on a million people to the faith, and\r\nhe had given Christianity a hold on the people of India and Japan\r\nwhich no political revolutions or religious persecution could ever\r\nloosen. He was canonised in 1622.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the Apostle of India the work that he had begun was\r\ncarried on by his brethren of the Society of Jesus in face of very\r\nserious difficulties. They were opposed by the Brahmins, who tried to\r\nstir up persecutions, and their progress was impeded by political\r\ndisturbances. The arrival of the Jesuit, Robert de' Nobili (1577-\r\n1656), in 1605 marked a new stage in the history of the conversion of\r\nIndia. After a visit paid to the city of Madura,[3] where one of his\r\nbrethren had been labouring for years without any visible fruit, de'\r\nNobili came to the conclusion that the comparative failure of the\r\nChristian missionaries was due to the contempt of the Brahmins for\r\nthem as Portuguese or friends of the Portuguese and as associates of\r\nthe pariahs, who were regarded by the Brahmins as being little better\r\nthan beasts. He determined to adopt new methods, to come to them not\r\nas a Portuguese but as a Roman, to avoid all contact with the pariahs\r\nor outcasts, to respect the national customs and caste divisions of\r\nthe country, and to secure a sympathetic hearing from the Brahmins by\r\nhis learning and specially by his intimate knowledge of the Indian\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nHis method was crowned with instant success. In a short time he had\r\nmade hundreds of converts in the very city where his colleague had\r\nlaboured in vain for years; and he had secured his converts, not by\r\nminimising or corrupting Catholic truth, but by a prudent regard for\r\nthe caste system and for certain rites and customs connected with it,\r\nwhich he tolerated as partaking of a national rather than of an\r\nessentially religious character. Objections were raised against his\r\nmethods by his fellow Jesuit in Madura. He was charged with\r\ncountenancing superstition by allowing the use of pagan rites, and\r\nwith encouraging schism and dissension by permitting no intermingling\r\nbetween the Brahmins and the pariahs even in the churches. In justice\r\nto Father de' Nobili and to those who favoured his methods, it ought\r\nto be said that they did not like the system of castes. They hoped\r\nthat under the influence of Christian charity such divisions might\r\ndisappear, and that just as the Church undermined rather than\r\ncondemned slavery in the first centuries, so too the missionaries in\r\nIndia might respect the prejudices of the Brahmins till these\r\nprejudices should have been extinguished by a closer acquaintance with\r\nthe doctrines and spirit of Christianity. The highly coloured reports\r\nsent in against him produced an unfavourable impression on his\r\nsuperiors, but when his defence was received at Rome Gregory XV.\r\nrefused to issue any condemnation (1623).\r\n\r\nDuring the lifetime of Father de' Nobili he pursued his own method\r\nwith success, though at the same time he never neglected an\r\nopportunity of providing secretly for the spiritual welfare of the\r\npoorer classes. After his death in 1656 many of the Jesuits continued\r\nhis policy, notwithstanding the fact that grave objections were raised\r\nby some of the other religious orders. A crisis came, however, in\r\nPondicherry which belonged to the French. The Capuchins were in charge\r\nof the mission, and attended both to the colonists and the natives.\r\nThe bishop decided to share the work between the Capuchins who were\r\nleft in charge of the colonists, and the Jesuits who were entrusted\r\nwith preaching to the natives (1699). The Capuchins appealed to Rome,\r\nand brought forward against the Jesuits the old charges that had been\r\nlevelled against Father de' Nobili, and that had given rise to such\r\nbitter controversies. The question of the Malabar Rites was carried\r\nonce more to Rome, and de Tournon, Patriarch of Antioch, was sent as\r\nlegate to investigate the case (1703). After remaining eight months in\r\nthe country, and before he had an opportunity of considering both\r\nsides of the question, he decided against the Jesuits (1704). This\r\ndecision was confirmed by the Pope in 1706. The controversy continued,\r\nhowever, till 1744, when Benedict XIV. in the Bull, /Omnium\r\nsollicitudinem/, issued a final condemnation of the Malabar Rites\r\n(1744).\r\n\r\nIn deference to the prejudices of the Brahmins a scheme was then\r\nformulated with the approval of the Pope for organising two classes of\r\nmissionaries, one for the Brahmins and another for the outcasts, but\r\nthe suppression of the Jesuits in the Portuguese dominions (1756) put\r\nan end to this system. The Carmelites did good service by their\r\nefforts to reconcile the Nestorian Christians with the Church. The\r\nfurther progress of the Catholic Church in India was impeded by the\r\nsuppression of the Jesuits, the invasion of India by the Dutch, the\r\ninsistence of Portugal upon its rights of patronage over all the\r\nchurches of India, the downfall of the religious spirit in Europe\r\nduring the eighteenth century, and finally by the destruction during\r\nthe French Revolution of the colleges and religious houses that\r\nsupplied workers for the mission.\r\n\r\nSt. Francis Xavier had planned to introduce the Christian faith into\r\nthe Celestial Empire, but he died almost in sight of the coast. The\r\nfirst missionary who made any progress in that country was another\r\nJesuit, Father Matteo Ricci[4] (1552-1610) who arrived in China in\r\n1582. He was a man of great ability, well versed in mathematics and in\r\nthe natural sciences, and well qualified to make an excellent\r\nimpression on the educated classes. He was protected by the mandarins,\r\nand respected by the Emperor, who invited him to the imperial palace\r\nat Pekin (1600). Although it was his scholarly attainments that\r\nattracted the Chinese rather than his religion, Father Ricci never\r\nfailed to seize every opportunity of directing the thoughts of his\r\npupils and admirers towards Christianity. At his death in 1610 many of\r\nthe mandarins had been converted, and most of the old prejudices\r\nagainst the new religion had disappeared. Other Jesuits equally\r\nlearned and equally prudent were ready to take his place. His\r\nsuccessor, Father Schall, was summoned by the Emperor to Pekin, and\r\nwas appointed president of the mathematical society. By his influence\r\nat court he obtained permission for his fellow-workers to open\r\nChristian churches in China, and secured the publication of various\r\nChristian books in the Chinese language. The revolution that preceded\r\nthe establishment of the Manchu dynasty (1644) led to some\r\npersecution, but the trouble was only of a temporary character. On the\r\ndeath of Father Schall in 1666, he was succeeded by Father Verbiest\r\nwho was also patronised by the court on account of his scholarly\r\nattainments. Finally in 1692 an imperial rescript was issued giving\r\nthe Christian missionaries full permission to preach the gospel\r\nthroughout the empire. At that period the number of converts was about\r\ntwenty thousand. Two bishoprics were erected, one at Pekin and one at\r\nNankin.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, as the Jesuits were practically speaking the only\r\nmissionaries in China, it was reserved for them as their special\r\nmission-field by Gregory XIII. (1585). But later on Clement VIII.\r\nallowed the Franciscans to go to China, and finally the country was\r\nopened to all Christian missionaries by Urban VIII. The presence of\r\nthe new labourers in the vineyard was not productive of so good\r\nresults as might have been expected. A fierce controversy that broke\r\nout regarding the Chinese Rites[5] principally between the Dominicans\r\nand Jesuits, did much to retard the progress of the Catholic Church in\r\nthe Celestial Empire for a long period. To understand the meaning of\r\nthis controversy it should be remembered that the Chinese people,\r\ndeeply attached to the memory of their ancestors and to their\r\nveneration for Confucius, were accustomed to perform certain rites and\r\nceremonies at fixed periods in memory of their departed relatives and\r\nin honour of Confucius. To prohibit these was to put an end to all\r\nhope of conversion, and to tolerate them looked like tolerating\r\nPaganism. Father Ricci decided to tolerate them, mainly on the ground\r\nthat they partook more of a civil than of a religious character, that\r\nin themselves they were harmless, that the Church has been always very\r\nprudent in regard to the national and civil customs of its converts,\r\nand that with the acceptance of Christianity all danger of\r\nmisunderstanding would soon disappear. Furthermore, for want of better\r\nnames for the Deity Father Ricci allowed the use of Tien-tschu (Lord\r\nof Heaven), Tien and Shangti (supreme emperor), words that had been\r\nused hitherto in an idolatrous sense, but which in themselves and as\r\nexplained by the Jesuit missionaries were orthodox enough. Both\r\nparties in the controversy meant well, and each could adduce very\r\nconvincing arguments in favour of its own views. The Dominicans\r\ncommissioned one of their number to denounce these customs to Rome as\r\nidolatrous. He submitted seventeen articles dealing with the Chinese\r\nRites to the Inquisition, and after a long discussion a provisional\r\ncondemnation was issued by Innocent X. (1645). Father Martini went to\r\nRome to defend the Chinese Rites, and to point out the serious\r\nconsequences which such a sweeping condemnation might have upon the\r\nwhole future of Christianity in China. In 1656 a decision more or less\r\nfavourable to the Jesuits was given by Alexander VII. The decision\r\nhelped to prolong rather than to settle the controversy. A crisis was\r\nreached, however, when Maigrot, vicar-apostolic of Fu-Kien, one of the\r\npriests belonging to the Society for Foreign Missions, denounced the\r\nChinese Rites as pure paganism, and interdicted their observance to\r\nall converts within his jurisdiction. The case was carried once more\r\nto Rome, and de Tournon was despatched as papal legate to decide the\r\ncase. In 1707 he issued a decree prohibiting the Chinese Rites,\r\nincurring thereby the enmity of the Emperor, who had him thrown into\r\nprison where he died (1710). All missionaries who obeyed his orders\r\nwere banished. The decision of the legate was supported by several\r\ndecrees from Rome, and at last in 1742 Benedict XIV. condemned the\r\nChinese Rites, and ordered that all missionaries to China should take\r\nan oath against further discussion of the question.\r\n\r\nThe controversy was carried on with considerable earnestness on both\r\nsides on account of the importance of the issues at stake, and was\r\nembittered considerably by political and religious disputes in Europe\r\nthat had no concern either with China or the Chinese Rites. The\r\ncondemnation had a disastrous effect on the missions. Nearly all the\r\nmissionaries were banished from the country, and the Christians were\r\nobliged to choose between apostasy and death.\r\n\r\nIn Japan[6] St. Francis Xavier had begun the work of conversion. He\r\nleft behind him two of his brethren who were joined soon by other\r\nmembers of the Society of Jesus, with the result that about the year\r\n1582 there were between one hundred and two hundred thousand Catholics\r\nin the country. An embassy consisting of three of the native princes\r\nvisited Rome in 1585. In many districts the local chiefs granted full\r\nliberty to the missionaries, and in a short time the number of\r\nChristians rose to three hundred thousand. Some of the authorities,\r\nalarmed by the rapid growth of foreign power in the country, began to\r\nwhisper among the people that the Christian missionaries were only\r\nspies working in the interest of Spain and Portugal. A violent\r\npersecution broke out against the Christians in 1587, and lasted for\r\nseveral years. Notwithstanding the savagery of the Pagans and the\r\npunishments decreed against the missionaries the Jesuits weathered the\r\nstorm, and fresh labourers arrived to support them in the persons of\r\nthe Dominicans, the Franciscans, and the Augustinians.\r\n\r\nBut national jealousy of the foreigners, more especially of the\r\nSpanish and Portuguese, fomented as it was by the Dutch and English,\r\nled to new troubles for the Christian communities. In 1614 a royal\r\ndecree was issued against the Christians, and a determined attempt was\r\nmade to destroy the work of the missionaries.\r\n\r\nPunishments of the most awful kind were inflicted on those who would\r\nnot abjure the Christian faith, and many, both priests and people,\r\nwere put to death. From 1614 till 1640 the persecution was carried on\r\nin a systematic and determined manner, so that by that time all the\r\nmissionaries were either dead or banished, and the whole of the young\r\ncommunities they had formed were scattered. For years Japan remained\r\nclosed against the missionaries who made various attempts to escape\r\nthe vigilance of the authorities.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the explanation, whether it was due to the severity of\r\nthe climate or to the savage character of the inhabitants, the\r\nChristian missions in Africa were not productive of much fruit. St.\r\nVincent de Paul sent some of his community to work in the district\r\naround Tunis and in the island of Madagascar. Missionaries from\r\nPortugal made various attempts to found Christian communities along\r\nthe whole western coast of Africa. In the Congo the results at first\r\nwere decidedly promising. Here the work was begun by the Dominicans,\r\nwho were assisted at a later period by the Capuchins, the\r\nAugustinians, and the Jesuits. Many of the inhabitants were won over\r\nto the faith, but as years passed, and as the supply of missionaries\r\nfailed, much of what had been accomplished was undone, though the\r\nCapuchins still continued their efforts. In Angola the Jesuits led the\r\nway, in Upper and Lower Guinea the Jesuits and the Carmelites, in\r\nMorocco and in Egypt the Franciscans, while various religious bodies\r\nundertook the work of evangelising the Portuguese colonies in Eastern\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nBy far the greatest triumph of the Church during this age of\r\nmissionary effort was that which was achieved by the conversion of the\r\nnative races in the territories occupied by Spain and Portugal in the\r\nwestern continent. The hope of extending the boundaries of the Church\r\nwas one of the motives that induced Columbus and his supporters to\r\nundertake their voyage of discovery, as it was also one of the motives\r\nurging the rulers of Spain to increase the sphere of their\r\njurisdiction. Hence from the very beginning great care was taken to\r\nprovide for the conversion of all the natives. Priests were despatched\r\nfrom Spain with all the expeditions. Dominicans, Franciscans,\r\nCarmelites, Augustinians, Fathers of the Order of Our Lady of Mercy,\r\nand after the establishment of the Society of Jesus, Jesuits vied with\r\neach other in their eagerness to risk their lives in the work.\r\nGenerous provision was made by the rulers of Spain for the support of\r\nthe clergy and the maintenance of religion. Churches were erected,\r\nepiscopal and archiepiscopal Sees were founded and endowed, colleges\r\nand monasteries were established by the various religious orders, and\r\nin the course of less than a century the Church had gained in the new\r\nworld almost as much as she had lost in the old.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish rulers were not inclined to destroy or to maltreat the\r\nnative races, but they were unable to supervise the greedy officials,\r\nmany of whom acted savagely towards the Indians, killing hundreds of\r\nthem and forcing the others to work as slaves. The hatred of the\r\nIndian races for the Spaniards made the work of the missionaries more\r\ndifficult, but from the beginning the Church espoused the cause of the\r\nIndians, sought to secure protection for them against the officials,\r\nand to restrain if not to extinguish entirely the practice of\r\nenslaving the natives. Bartholomew de Las Casas[7] (1474-1566) at\r\nfirst a secular priest, then a Dominican, and afterwards a bishop,\r\ntook a prominent part in the struggle on behalf of the natives, and\r\nthough his methods were not always of the most prudent character he\r\nhelped to put down some of the most glaring abuses. Charles V. was\r\nmost sympathetic towards the Indians, laid down very strict rules for\r\nhis subordinates, and invited the bishops to become protectors of the\r\nIndians, while Paul III. insisted strongly on the freedom of the\r\nnatives and their rights as men (1537).\r\n\r\nSome of the West Indian Islands which Columbus discovered were thickly\r\npopulated. The Franciscans and Dominicans set to work at once to\r\nconvert the native people of Hayti, many of whom were destroyed by the\r\nSpaniards despite the efforts of the missionaries. Cuba was taken\r\npossession of by the Spaniards in 1511, and Mexico[8] or New Spain was\r\nconquered by Hernando Cortes in 1519. The people that inhabited this\r\ncountry were much more intelligent and cultured than the other native\r\nraces. They had flourishing towns, beautiful temples and public\r\nbuildings, and a fairly well organised form of government. Cortes\r\ninvited the Franciscans to undertake the work of conversion. They were\r\nfollowed by the Dominicans, by the Order of Our Lady of Mercy and by\r\nthe Jesuits. Bishop Zumarraga, the first bishop in Mexican territory,\r\nopened schools for the education of the Indians, as did also the\r\nFranciscans and the other religious orders. The Jesuits established\r\nthe great college of San Ildefonso, and in 1553 the royal and\r\npontifical University of Mexico was opened for the reception of\r\nstudents. By the Bull, /Universalis Ecclesiae regimini/, full rights\r\nof patronage over all the churches of New Spain were conferred on the\r\nrulers of Spain, and religious affairs were placed under the control\r\nof the Council of the Indies.\r\n\r\nFrom the West Indies Christianity made its way into Central America\r\nwhich was acquired by Spain in 1513. The Dominicans, Capuchins, and\r\nJesuits preached the faith in Guiana. Venezuela was evangelised at\r\nfirst by the Franciscans (1508) and by the Dominicans (1520). Later on\r\nCapuchins, Jesuits, and Augustinians took part in the work. By the\r\nyear 1600 fully two-thirds of the natives were converted. Peru was\r\nconquered for Spain by Francis Pizarro in 1532. The inhabitants of\r\nthis country were highly civilised, with a regular government, and\r\nwith a form of religious worship much superior to any of the Pagan\r\nsystems with which the Spaniard had come into contact. For a while the\r\nconversion of the country was delayed owing to the cruelties inflicted\r\non the natives and the conflicts between the Spanish leaders, but in a\r\nshort time the Franciscans and Dominicans undertook missions to the\r\nnatives with great success. In 1546 Lima was created an archbishopric,\r\nand in a few years a university was opened. St. Rose of Lima (1586-\r\n1617) was the first saint of American birth to be canonised officially\r\n(1671). By the beginning of the seventeenth century the majority of\r\nthe natives were converted.\r\n\r\nBrazil[9] was discovered by the Portuguese, Alvares de Cabral (1500),\r\nwho named it Vera Cruz because his ship came to anchor there on Good\r\nFriday. The Franciscans were early in the field to tend to the\r\nspiritual wants of the natives, who stood in need of some defenders to\r\nprotect them from the greed of the Portuguese officials. At the\r\nrequest of King John III. St. Ignatius despatched some of his\r\nfollowers to Brazil (1549). A great college was opened by the Jesuits\r\nfor the education of young men. The wars with the French, the invasion\r\nof Brazil by the Dutch, and the opposition of officials who were\r\nannoyed at the protection afforded the natives by the missionaries,\r\nrendered the work of conversion exceedingly difficult. But\r\n\"reductions\" or settlements of Indians were formed by the Jesuits,\r\nCapuchins, Carmelites, and others, and episcopal Sees were established\r\nthroughout the country. The expulsion of the Jesuits in 1759 was a\r\nsevere blow to the missions in Brazil.\r\n\r\nParaguay[10] was taken possession of by Spain in 1536. The Franciscan\r\nFathers who accompanied the expedition addressed themselves at once to\r\nthe conversion of the natives; but the difficulty of making themselves\r\nunderstood, the cruelty of the first conquerors towards the natives,\r\nand the bad example of the early colonists, made their work much more\r\ndifficult than it might have been.\r\n\r\nThe Dominicans, the Augustinians and the Order of Mercy came to the\r\nassistance of the first missionaries, and three episcopal sees were\r\nestablished. One of the bishops, a Dominican, invited the Jesuits to\r\ncome to Paraguay (1586). They established colleges in several of the\r\nleading centres, and sent out their members in all directions to\r\npreach to the Indians, over whom they acquired in a short time a very\r\nsalutary influence. But the harshness of the Spanish officials, and\r\nthe bad example they gave to the native converts, made it necessary\r\nfor the Jesuits to form \"Reductions\" or special settlements, where the\r\nIndians might live apart from the Spaniards, and where they might be\r\nfree from oppression and the corrupting influence of their Spanish\r\nmasters. Philip III. of Spain approved this plan, and ordained that\r\nthe Reductions should be subject directly to the Crown. In these\r\nsettlements the Jesuits trained the natives in agriculture and in\r\ntrades, but the peace of the communities was disturbed frequently by\r\nthe slave-hunters against whom the Spanish officials refused to take\r\naction. As a last resource the Jesuits organised an Indian force, and\r\nprovided them with arms for self-protection. Close on a million\r\nconverted natives were attached to the thirty-one Reductions that\r\nformed a kingdom of independent principality subject only to Spain.\r\nThis happy condition of affairs was not destined to last forever. By a\r\ntreaty made in 1750 Spain, in return for some territory ceded by\r\nPortugal, handed over to Portugal seven of the Reductions. The Jesuits\r\npleaded for delay in carrying out the eviction of the Indians who were\r\nsettled in this territory, and when their appeal was refused they\r\nadvised the Indians to submit. Some of them followed this advice while\r\nothers of them flew to arms only to be defeated (1756). The blame for\r\nthe rebellion was attributed to the Jesuits by Pombal and the other\r\nenemies of the Society in Portugal. By a royal decree issued in 1767\r\nthe Jesuits were expelled from Paraguay, and in a few years the\r\nflourishing communities which they had established were completely\r\ndissolved.[11]\r\n\r\nChristianity reached the territory now known as the United States from\r\nthree distinct sources, namely, the Spanish colonies in the south, the\r\nFrench settlements in the north, and from the English Catholic colony\r\nof Maryland in the east. The sphere of influence of the Spanish\r\nmissionaries was Florida, California, New Mexico, and Texas. In 1526\r\nan expedition under the command of de Narvaez and accompanied by\r\nseveral Franciscan Fathers was sent to explore Florida, but the\r\nexpedition ended in complete failure. Several other attempts of a\r\nsimilar kind were made with no better results till at last, aroused by\r\nthe danger of a French occupation, Menendez established a permanent\r\nsettlement at Fort St. Augustine and prepared the way for Spanish\r\noccupation (1565). Menendez, zealous for the conversion of the\r\nnatives, invited the Jesuits to come to Florida, as did also the\r\nFranciscans. At first the work of conversion was attended with great\r\ndifficulties and proceeded very slowly, but by the year 1700 many\r\nChristian villages had been established. The attacks of the English on\r\nFlorida injured the missions, and the cession of Florida to England\r\n(1763) completed the work of destruction.[12]\r\n\r\nLower California was discovered by Cortez in 1533, and Upper\r\nCalifornia by Cabrillo eleven years later. In the beginning the\r\nmissionaries encountered great opposition, but after 1697 the Jesuit\r\nFathers were very successful. They formed the natives into permanent\r\nsettlements or reductions, and so rapidly did the work of\r\nevangelisation proceed that in 1767, the year in which the Jesuits\r\nwere expelled by Spain, nearly all the Indians were converted. The\r\nFranciscan Fathers succeeded the Jesuits, continuing their reductions\r\nin Lower California, and introducing missions of a similar kind among\r\nthe Indians of Upper California. The Dominicans, also, rendered\r\nvaluable assistance. In 1822 California was ceded to the United\r\nStates, and the missions were broken up owing to the hostility of the\r\ncivil authorities.[13]\r\n\r\nThe Franciscans were the first to undertake missions in New Mexico\r\n(1539). Several of the missionaries suffered martyrdom in their\r\nattempts to convert the natives, but it was only after 1597 that any\r\nconsiderable progress was made. In Texas the earliest real effort at\r\nintroducing Christianity among the natives was made in the last\r\nquarter of the seventeenth century. The work of the Franciscans was\r\ndisturbed by rebellions among the Indians and by war, but\r\nnotwithstanding these obstacles several flourishing Indian settlements\r\nwere established. In 1813 the Spanish Cortes issued a decree that the\r\nmissions in Texas should be secularised.[14]\r\n\r\nAlthough others had preceded him, yet the honour of discovering\r\nCanada[15] is assigned generally to Jacques Cartier who made three\r\nvoyages to the country (1534-42). Early in the seventeenth century the\r\ntwo Jesuits Biard and Masse arrived and began the conversion of the\r\nIndian tribes settled in Acadia, which embraced Nova Scotia and New\r\nBrunswick. In 1608 Samuel de Champlain, \"the Father of New France\"\r\narrived and laid the foundation of Quebec. He invited the Franciscan\r\nRecollects to preach to the Indian tribes, namely, the Algonquins and\r\nthe Hurons (1615). The Franciscans went to work with a will, preaching\r\nto the people and opening schools for the young, but finding their\r\nnumbers too few for the mighty task, they invited the Jesuits to come\r\nto their assistance (1625). Several Jesuits including Fathers Brebeuf\r\nand Lallemant hastened to Canada and undertook missions to the Hurons.\r\nThe invasion and capture of Quebec in 1629 by the English interrupted\r\nthe work for a time, but on the restoration of the territory to France\r\nin 1632 the Jesuits continued their labours with renewed vigour. The\r\nfierce tribe of the Iroquois were the strongest opponents of the\r\nChristian missionaries, many of whom they put to death. Father Jogues\r\nwas put to death in 1646, and a little later Fathers Daniel, Brebeuf,\r\nand Lallement together with several of their companions met a similar\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding these reverses the work of Christianising the\r\nnative races of Canada proceeded apace. In 1642 the city of Montreal\r\nwas founded, and in 1657 the superior of the Sulpicians despatched\r\nseveral of his community to labour in the new colony. Two years later\r\nFrancois de Montmorency-Laval arrived as first bishop and vicar-\r\napostolic of New France. West and east the missionaries continued to\r\nwin new conquests for the Church. The English, however, gave great\r\ntrouble to the missionaries by stirring up the Indian tribes to make\r\nwar on the Christian settlements. Nor was the French colony,\r\npractically deserted as it had been by the mother country, able to\r\nhold its own against the English colonists. In 1713 France ceded to\r\nEngland Acadia, Newfoundland, and the Hudson Bay territory. In Acadia\r\nthe Catholic missions had been very successful, but in 1755 the\r\nunfortunate Catholics, who refused to take the oath that was tendered\r\nto them, were seized and deported. In 1759 Quebec was taken, and by\r\nthe Treaty of Paris (1763) Canada passed under the dominion of the\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nMany French missionaries from Canada worked in the district stretching\r\nfrom the St. Lawrence to Lake Superior, and missions were established\r\nby the Jesuits in the states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Illinois. In\r\n1673 Father Marquette (1636-75) undertook a journey southward to visit\r\nthe great river about which he had heard from the Indians, and to open\r\nup new fields of work for himself and his associates. He succeeded in\r\nreaching the Mississippi, and sailed down the river as far as the\r\nmouth of Arkansas. As a result of the information acquired from those\r\nwho returned from this voyage of exploration, expeditions were sent\r\nout by the French to take possession of the new territories and to\r\nerect fortifications against the further advance westward of the\r\nEnglish colonists. The city of New Orleans was founded in 1717.\r\nMissionaries--Capuchins, Jesuits, and priests of the Society for\r\nForeign Missions--preached the gospel with great success to the\r\nnatives in Louisiana, Mississippi, Iowa, Arkansas, and Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits, under the leadership of Father White, who settled in the\r\ncolony founded in Maryland (1534), devoted themselves to the\r\nconversion of the Indians, but the expulsion of Lord Baltimore in 1644\r\nand the victory of the Puritans led to the almost complete destruction\r\nof these Indian missions.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] Launay, /Histoire generale de la Societe des Missions-Etrangeres/,\r\n    1894.\r\n\r\n[2] Coleridge, /Life and Letters of St. Francis Xavier/, 1902.\r\n\r\n[3] Bertrand, /La Mission du Madure/, 1847.\r\n\r\n[4] Brucker, /Le Pere Mattieu Ricci/ (/Etudes/, 1910).\r\n\r\n[5] Daniel, /Histoire apologetique de la conduite des Jesuites de la\r\n    Chine/, 1724.

The views of\r\nLuther and Calvin on Grace and Justification were in a sense the very\r\nfoundation of their systems, and hence it was of vital importance that\r\nthese questions should be submitted to a searching examination, and\r\nthat the doctrine of the Catholic Church should be formulated in such\r\na way as to make cavilling and misunderstanding impossible. This work\r\nwas done with admirable lucidity and directness in the fifth and sixth\r\nsessions of the Council of Trent, but nevertheless these decrees of\r\nthe Council did not prevent the theories of Luther and Calvin being\r\npropagated vigorously, and from exercising a certain amount of\r\ninfluence even on some Catholic theologians who had no sympathy with\r\nthe religious revolt.\r\n\r\nAmongst these might be reckoned Michael Baius (De Bay, 1513-89) a\r\nprofessor at the University of Louvain and John Hessels, one of his\r\nsupporters in the theological controversies of the day. They believed\r\nthat Catholic apologists were handicapped seriously by their slavish\r\nregard for the authority and methods of the Scholastics, and that if\r\ninstead of appealing to the writings of St. Thomas as the ultimate\r\ncriterion of truth they were to insist more on the authority of the\r\nBible and of the works of the Early Fathers, such as St. Cyprian, St.\r\nJerome, and St. Augustine, they would find themselves on much safer\r\nground, and their arguments would be more likely to command the\r\nrespect of their opponents. Hence at Louvain, in their own lectures,\r\nin their pamphlets, and in private discussions, they insisted strongly\r\nthat Scholasticism should make way for positive theology, and that the\r\nScriptures and patristic literature should take the place of the\r\n/Summa/. Not content, however, with a mere change of method they began\r\nto show their contempt for traditional opinions, and in a short time\r\nalarming rumours were in circulation both inside and outside the\r\nuniversity that their teaching on Original Sin, Grace, and Free-will,\r\nwas not in harmony with the doctrine of the Church. The Franciscans\r\nsubmitted to the judgment of the Sorbonne a number of propositions\r\n(18) selected from the writings or lectures of Baius and his friends,\r\nand the opinion of the Sorbonne was distinctly unfavourable. As the\r\ndispute grew more heated and threatened to have serious consequences\r\nfor the university and the country, Cardinal Granvelle, believing that\r\nthe absence of the two professors might lead to peace, induced both to\r\nproceed to the Council of Trent as the theologians of the King of\r\nSpain (1563). Though the opinions of Baius found little sympathy with\r\nthe Fathers of Trent, yet since the subjects of Original Sin and Grace\r\nhad been discussed and defined already, nothing was done. On his\r\nreturn (1564) from the Council of Trent Baius published several\r\npamphlets in explanation and defence of his views, all of which were\r\nattacked by his opponents, so that in a short time the university was\r\nsplit into two opposing camps.\r\n\r\nTo put an end to the trouble the rector determined to seek the\r\nintervention of Rome. In October 1567 Pius V. issued the Bull, /Ex\r\nomnibus afflictionibus/, in which he condemned seventy-nine\r\npropositions selected from the writings or lectures of Baius without\r\nmentioning the author's name.[1] The friends of Baius raised many\r\ndifficulties regarding the reception and the interpretation of the\r\npapal document, and though Baius himself professed his entire\r\nsubmission to the decision, the tone of his letter to the Pope was\r\nlittle short of offensive. The Pope replied that the case having been\r\nexamined fully and adjudged acceptance of the decision was imperative.\r\nOnce more Baius announced his intention of submitting (1569), and so\r\nconfident were his colleagues of his orthodoxy that he was appointed\r\ndean of the theological faculty, and later on chancellor of the\r\nuniversity. But his actions did not correspond with his professions.\r\nVarious arguments were put forward to weaken the force of the papal\r\ncondemnation until at last Gregory XIII. was forced to issue a new\r\nBull, /Provisionis nostrae/ (1579), and to send the learned Jesuit,\r\nFrancisco Toledo, to demand that Baius should abjure his errors, and\r\nthat the teaching of Pius V. should be accepted at Louvain. The papal\r\nletter was read in a formal meeting of the university, whereupon Baius\r\nsigned a form of abjuration, by which he acknowledged that the\r\ncondemnation of the propositions was just and reasonable, and that he\r\nwould never again advocate such views. This submission relieved the\r\ntension of the situation, but it was a long time before the evil\r\ninfluence of Baianism disappeared, and before peace was restored\r\nfinally to Louvain.\r\n\r\nThe system propounded by Baius had much in common with the teaching of\r\nPelagius, Luther, and Calvin. His failure to recognise the clear\r\ndistinction between the natural and the supernatural was the source of\r\nmost of his errors. According to him the state of innocence in which\r\nour first parents were created, their destination to the enjoyment of\r\nthe Beatific Vision, and all the gifts bestowed upon them for the\r\nattainment of this end were due to them, so that had they persevered\r\nduring life they should have merited eternal happiness as a reward for\r\ntheir good works. When, however, man sinned by disobedience he not\r\nmerely lost gratuitous or supernatural endowments, but his whole\r\nnature was weakened and corrupted by Original Sin which, in the system\r\nof Baius, was to be identified with concupiscence, and which was\r\ntransmitted from father to son according to the ordinary laws of\r\nheredity. This concupiscence, he contended, was in itself sinful, as\r\nwas also every work which proceeds from it. This was true even in case\r\nof children, because that an act be meritorious or demeritorious Free-\r\nwill was not required. So long as the act was done voluntarily even\r\nthough necessarily, it was to be deemed worthy of reward or\r\npunishment, since freedom from external compulsion was alone required\r\nfor moral responsibility.\r\n\r\nFrom the miserable condition into which man had fallen he was rescued\r\nby the Redemption of Christ, on account of which much that had been\r\nforfeited was restored. These graces procured for man by Christ may be\r\ncalled supernatural, not because they were not due to human nature,\r\nbut because human nature had been rendered positively unworthy of them\r\nby Original Sin. The justice, however, by which a man is justified,\r\nconsisted not in any supernatural quality infused into the soul, by\r\nwhich the individual was made a participator of the divine nature, but\r\nimplied merely a condition in which the moral law was observed\r\nstrictly. Hence justification, according to Baius, could be separated\r\nfrom the forgiveness of guilt, so that though the guilt of the sinner\r\nmay not have been remitted still he may be justified. In sin two\r\nthings were to be distinguished, the act and the liability to\r\npunishment. The act could never be effaced, but the temporal\r\npunishment was remitted by the actual reception of the sacraments,\r\nwhich were introduced by Christ solely for that purpose. The Mass\r\npossessed, he held, any efficacy that it had only because it was a\r\ngood moral act and helped to draw us more closely to God.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] Denzinger, op. cit., nos. 1001-1080.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    (b) The Molonist Controversy.\r\n\r\n  See bibliography VI.

When, however, the systems of Calvin and Luther began to take\r\nroot some of those who were brought into close contact with the new\r\ndoctrines arrived at the conclusion that the arguments of their\r\nopponents could be overcome more effectually by introducing some\r\nmodifications of the theories of St. Thomas concerning the operation\r\nof Grace and Free-will. The Jesuits particularly were of this opinion,\r\nand in 1584 the general, Aquaviva, allowed his subjects to depart in\r\nsome measure from the teaching of the /Summa/. This step was regarded\r\nwith disfavour in many influential quarters, and induced scholars to\r\nbe much more critical about Jesuit theology than otherwise they might\r\nhave been. In their College at Louvain there were two Jesuit\r\ntheologians Lessius (1584-1623) and Hamel, who both in their lectures\r\nand theses advanced certain theories on man's co-operation with Grace\r\nand on Predestination, that were deemed by many to be dangerously akin\r\nto the doctrine of the Semi-Pelagians (1587). The fact that the\r\nJesuits had been the consistent opponents of Baianism induced Baius\r\nand his friends to cast the whole weight of their influence against\r\nLessius. A sharp controversy broke out once more in the Netherlands.\r\nThe Universities of Louvain and Douay censured thirty-four\r\npropositions of Lessius as Semi-Pelagian, while the Universities of\r\nIngolstadt and Mainz declared in favour of their orthodoxy. The matter\r\nhaving been referred to Rome, Sixtus V. imposed silence on both\r\nparties, without pronouncing any formal condemnation or approval of\r\nthe propositions that had been denounced (1588).\r\n\r\nThe controversy in the Spanish Netherlands was only the prelude to a\r\nmuch more serious conflict in Spain itself. In 1588 the well-known\r\nJesuit, Luis de Molina (1535-1600) published at Lisbon his celebrated\r\nwork, /Concordia liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis etc./ with the\r\napprobation of the Dominican, Bartholomew Ferreira, and the permission\r\nof the Inquisition. Hardly had the work left the printing press than\r\nit was attacked warmly by Domingo Banez (1528-1604), the friend and\r\nspiritual director of St. Teresa, and one of the ablest Dominicans of\r\nhis time. He had been engaged already in a controversy with the\r\nJesuit, Montemaior, on the same subject of Grace, but the publication\r\nof Molina's book added new fuel to the flame, and in a short time the\r\ndispute assumed such serious proportions that bishops, theologians,\r\nuniversities, students, and even the leading officials of the state,\r\nwere obliged to take sides. The Dominicans supported Banez, while the\r\nJesuits with some few exceptions rallied to the side of Molina. The\r\nlatter's book was denounced to the Inquisition, but as a counterblast\r\nto this Banez also was accused of very serious errors. If Molina was\r\nblamed for being a Semi-Pelagian, Banez was charged with having\r\nsteered too closely to Calvinism. In the hope of restoring peace to\r\nthe Church in Spain Clement VIII. reserved the decision of the case to\r\nhis own tribunal (1596).\r\n\r\nTo get a grasp of the meaning of the controversy, it should be borne\r\nin mind that in all theories concerning the operation of Grace three\r\npoints must be safeguarded by all Catholic theologians, namely, man's\r\ndependence upon God as the First Cause of all his actions natural as\r\nwell as supernatural, human liberty, and God's omniscience or\r\nforeknowledge of man's conduct. Following in the footsteps of St.\r\nThomas, the Dominicans maintained that when God wishes man to perform\r\na good act He not only gives assistance, but He actually moves or\r\npredetermines the will so that it must infallibly act. In this way the\r\nentire act comes from God as the First Cause, and at the same time it\r\nis the free act of the creature, because the human will though moved\r\nand predetermined by God acts according to its own nature, that is to\r\nsay, it acts freely. In His eternal decrees by which God ordained to\r\ngive this premotion or predetermination He sees infallibly the actions\r\nand conduct of men, and acting on this knowledge He predestines the\r\njust to glory /ante praevisa merita/. According to this system,\r\ntherefore, the efficaciousness of Grace comes from the Grace itself,\r\nand is not dependent upon the co-operation of the human will.\r\n\r\nAgainst this Molina maintained that the human faculties having been\r\nelevated by what might be called prevenient Grace, so as to make them\r\ncapable of producing a supernatural act, the act itself is performed\r\nby the will co-operating with the impulse given by God. Man is,\r\ntherefore, free, and at the same time dependent upon God in the\r\nperformance of every good act. He is free, because the human will may\r\nor may not co-operate with the divine assistance, and he is dependent\r\nupon God, because it is only by being elevated by prevenient Grace\r\nfreely given by God that the human will is capable of co-operating in\r\nthe production of a supernatural act. It follows, too, that the\r\nefficaciousness of Grace arises not from the Grace itself but from the\r\nfree co-operation of the will, and that a Grace in itself truly\r\nsufficient might not be efficacious through the failure of the will to\r\nco-operate with it. The omniscience of God is safeguarded, because,\r\naccording to Molina, God sees infallibly man's conduct by means of the\r\n/scientia media/ or knowledge of future conditional events (so called\r\nbecause it stands midway between the knowledge of possibles and the\r\nknowledge of actuals). That is to say He sees infallibly what man\r\nwould do freely in all possible circumstances were he given this or\r\nthat particular Grace, and acting upon this knowledge He predestines\r\nthe just to glory /post praevisa merita/. The main difficulty urged\r\nagainst Molina was, that by conceding too much to human liberty he was\r\nbut renewing in another form the errors of Pelagius; while the\r\nprincipal objection brought forward against the Dominicans was, that\r\nby conceding too much to Grace they were destroying human liberty, and\r\napproaching too closely to Calvin's teaching on Predestination.\r\nNeedless to say, however much they differed on the points, both the\r\nfollowers of St. Thomas and the friends of Molina were at one in\r\nrepudiating the doctrines of Calvin and Pelagius.\r\n\r\nA special commission (/Congregatio de Auxiliis/), presided over by\r\nCardinals Madrucci and Arrigone, was appointed to examine the\r\nquestions at issue. The first session was held in January 1598, and in\r\nFebruary of the same year the majority of the members reported in\r\nfavour of condemning Molina's book. Clement VIII. requested the\r\ncommission to consider the evidence more fully, but in a comparatively\r\nshort time the majority presented a second report unfavourable to\r\nMolina. Representatives of the Dominicans and Jesuits were invited to\r\nattend in the hope that by means of friendly discussion an agreement\r\nsatisfactory to both parties might be secured. In 1601 the majority\r\nwere in favour of condemning twenty propositions taken from Molina's\r\nwork, but the Pope refused to confirm the decision. From 1602 till\r\n1605 the sessions were held in the presence of the Pope and of many of\r\nthe cardinals. Among the consultors was Peter Lombard, Archbishop of\r\nArmagh. The death of Clement VIII. in March 1605 led to an\r\nadjournment. In September 1605 the sessions were resumed and continued\r\ntill March 1606, when the votes of the consultors were handed in. In\r\nJuly 1607 these were placed before the cardinals for their opinions,\r\nbut a little later it was announced that the decision of the Holy See\r\nwould be made public at the proper time, and that meanwhile both\r\nparties were at liberty to teach their opinions. Neither side was,\r\nhowever, to accuse the other of heresy. Since that time no definite\r\ndecision has been given, and, so far as the dogmas of faith are\r\nconcerned, theologians are at full liberty to accept Thomism or\r\nMolinism.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            (c) Jansenism.\r\n\r\n  Rapin, /Histoire du Jansenisme depuis son origine jusqu' en 1644/,\r\n  1861.

Amongst those who fell under the sway of\r\nBaianism at this period the best known if not the ablest was Cornelius\r\nJansen (1585-1638). He studied at Utrecht, Paris, and Louvain. While\r\nin this latter place he formed a resolve to join the Society of Jesus,\r\nbut for some reason or another he was refused admission, a slight\r\nwhich accounts in some measure for the continued antipathy he\r\ndisplayed during his life towards the Jesuits. At Louvain, too, he was\r\nassociated very closely with a brilliant young French student, John du\r\nVerger de Hauranne (1581-1643), better known as the Abbot of St.\r\nCyran, whom he accompanied to Paris and afterwards to Bayonne, where\r\nboth lived for almost twelve years. During these years of intimate\r\nfriendship they had many opportunities of discussing the condition and\r\nprospects of the Catholic Church, the prevalence of what they\r\nconsidered Pelagian views amongst theologians, the neglect of the\r\nstudy of the Fathers, above all of St. Augustine, the laxity of\r\nconfessors in imparting absolution and allowing their penitents to\r\nreceive Holy Communion, and the absolute necessity of returning to the\r\nstrict discipline of the early Church. In 1617 the two friends\r\nseparated, Jansen returning to Louvain, where he was appointed to a\r\nchair of scriptural exegesis, and du Verger to Paris, where he took up\r\nhis residence though he held at the same time the commendatory abbacy\r\nof St. Cyran. As professor of Scripture Jansen showed himself both\r\nindustrious and orthodox, so that in 1636 on the nomination of Philip\r\nIV. of Spain he was appointed Bishop of Ypres. From that time till\r\n1639, when he passed away, he administered the affairs of his diocese\r\nwith commendable prudence and zeal.\r\n\r\nDuring the greater portion of his life he had devoted all his spare\r\nmoments to the study of the works of St. Augustine, especially those\r\ndirected against the Pelagians, and he had prepared a treatise on\r\nGrace, in which treatise he claimed to have reproduced exactly the\r\nteaching of St. Augustine. This work was finished but not published\r\nwhen he took seriously ill, and the manuscript was handed over by him\r\nto some friends for publication. Before his death, however, he\r\ndeclared in presence of witnesses that \"if the Holy See wishes any\r\nchange I am an obedient son and I submit to that Church in which I\r\nhave lived to my dying hour.\"[1] Notwithstanding various efforts that\r\nwere made to prevent publication Jansen's book /Augustinus/ was given\r\nto the world in 1640.\r\n\r\nLike Baius Jansen refused to recognise that in the condition of\r\ninnocence, in which man was constituted before the Fall, he was\r\nendowed with numerous gifts and graces, that were pure gifts of God in\r\nno way due to human nature. Hence he maintained that by the sin of our\r\nFirst Parents human nature was essentially corrupted, and man fell\r\nhelplessly under the control of concupiscence, so that, do what he\r\nwould, he must of necessity sin. There was therefore in man an\r\nirresistible inclination impelling him towards evil, to counteract\r\nwhich Grace was given as a force impelling him towards good, with the\r\nresult that he was drawn necessarily towards good or evil according to\r\nthe relative strength of these two conflicting delectations. It\r\nfollowed from this that merely sufficient grace was never given. If\r\nthe Grace was stronger than the tendency towards evil it was\r\nefficacious; if it was weaker it was not sufficient. Yet, whether he\r\nacted under the impulse of Grace or of concupiscence, man acted\r\nfreely, because, according to Jansen, absence of all external pressure\r\nwas all that was required to make an act free and worthy of praise or\r\nblame.\r\n\r\nThe book /Augustinus/ created a profound sensation among theologians.\r\nIt was hailed as a marvel of learning and ability by those who were\r\nstill attached secretly to the school of Baius as well as by the\r\nenemies of the Jesuits. A new edition appeared in Paris only to be\r\ncondemned by the Holy Office (1641) and by Urban VIII. in the Bull,\r\n/In Eminenti/ (1642). Various difficulties were raised against the\r\nacceptance of the papal decision in Louvain and in the Netherlands,\r\nand it was only after a long delay and by threats of extreme measures\r\nthat the Archbishop of Mechlin and those who followed him were obliged\r\nto submit (1653).\r\n\r\nThe real struggle regarding /Augustinus/ was to be waged, however, in\r\nParis and France. There, the Abbot of St. Cyran had been busily at\r\nwork preparing the way for Jansen's doctrine, by attacking the modern\r\nlaxity of the Church, and advocating the necessity of a complete\r\nreturn to the rigorous discipline of the early centuries. He had made\r\nthe acquaintance of the family of the celebrated lawyer, Antoine\r\nArnauld, six of whose family had entered the convent of Port Royal, of\r\nwhich one of them, Angelique,[2] was then superioress, while his\r\nyoungest son, Antoine, a pupil of St. Cyran, was destined to be the\r\nleader of the French Jansenists. St. Cyran insisted on such rigorous\r\nconditions for the worthy reception of the Eucharist, that people\r\nfeared to receive Holy Communion lest they should be guilty of\r\nsacrilege, and for a similar reason many priests abstained from the\r\ncelebration of Mass. He attacked the Jesuits for their laxity of\r\ndoctrine and practice in regard to the Sacrament of Penance. He\r\nhimself insisted on the absolute necessity of perfect contrition and\r\ncomplete satisfaction as an essential condition for absolution. These\r\nviews were accepted by the nuns at Port Royal and by many clergy in\r\nParis. On account of certain writings likely to lead to religious\r\ntrouble St. Cyran was arrested by order of Cardinal Richelieu (1638)\r\nand died in 1643. His place was taken by his brilliant pupil, Antoine\r\nArnauld, who had been ordained priest in 1641, and who like his master\r\nwas the determined opponent of the Jesuits. In 1643 he published a\r\nbook entitled /De la frequente Communion/, in which he put forward\r\nsuch strict theories about the conditions required for the worthy\r\nreception of the Eucharist that many people were frightened into\r\nabstaining even from fulfilling their Easter Communion. Despite the\r\nefforts of St. Vincent de Paul and others the book was read freely and\r\nproduced widespread and alarming results.\r\n\r\nThe condemnation pronounced by Urban VIII. (1642) against\r\n/Augustinus/, though accepted by the king, the Archbishop of Paris,\r\nand the Sorbonne, found many staunch opponents. It was contended that\r\nthe condemnation was the work of the Jesuits rather than of the Pope,\r\nthat it was based on the groundless supposition that the system of\r\nJansen was identical with that of Baius, and that as no individual\r\nproposition in /Augustinus/ had been condemned people were perfectly\r\nfree to discuss the views it contained. To put an end to all\r\npossibility of misunderstanding Cornet, syndic of Paris University,\r\nselected from /Augustinus/ five propositions, which he believed\r\ncontained the whole essence of Jansen's system, and submitted them to\r\nthe Sorbonne for examination (1649). Owing to the intervention of the\r\nParliament of Paris in favour of the Jansenists the propositions were\r\nreferred to the Assembly of the Clergy (1650), but the vast body of\r\nthe bishops considered that it was a question on which a decision\r\nshould be sought from Rome. Accordingly eighty-five of the bishops\r\naddressed a petition to Innocent X. (1651) requesting him to pronounce\r\na definitive sentence on the orthodoxy or unorthodoxy of the five\r\npropositions, while a minority of their body objected to such an\r\nappeal as an infringement of the liberties of the Gallican Church. A\r\ncommission, some of the members of which were recognised supporters of\r\nthe Jansenists, was appointed by the Pope to examine the question, and\r\nafter prolonged discussions extending over two years Innocent X.\r\nissued the Bull, /Cum occasione/ (1653), by which the five\r\npropositions were condemned. The Bull was received so favourably by\r\nthe king, the bishops, and the Sorbonne that it was hoped the end of\r\nthe controversy was in sight.\r\n\r\nThe Jansenists, however, soon discovered a new method of evading the\r\ncondemnation and of rendering the papal letters null and void. They\r\nadmitted that the five propositions were justly censured, but they\r\ndenied that these propositions were to be found in /Augustinus/, or,\r\nif they were in /Augustinus/, they contended they were there in a\r\nsense quite different from that which had been condemned by the Pope.\r\nTo justify this position they introduced the celebrated distinction\r\nbetween law and fact; that is to say, while admitting the authority of\r\nthe Church to issue definite and binding decisions on doctrinal\r\nmatters, they denied that she was infallible in regard to questions of\r\nfact, as for example, whether a certain proposition was contained in a\r\ncertain book or what might be the meaning which the author intended to\r\nconvey. On matters of fact such as these the Church might err, and the\r\nmost that could be demanded of the faithful in case of such decisions\r\nwas respectful silence. At the same time by means of sermons,\r\npamphlets, and letters, by advice given to priests, and by the\r\ninfluence of several religious houses, notably Port Royal, the sect\r\nwas gaining ground rapidly in Paris, and feeling began to run high\r\nagainst the Jesuits. The antipathy to the Jesuits was increased and\r\nbecame much more general after the appearance of the /Lettres\r\nProvinciales/ (1656-57) written by Pascal (1623-62). The writer was an\r\nexceedingly able controversialist, and in many respects a deeply\r\nreligious man. From the point of view of literature the /Provincial\r\nLetters/ were in a sense a masterpiece, but they were grossly unfair\r\nto those whom they attacked.[3]\r\n\r\nThe Sorbonne offered a strong opposition to the Jansenists, as did\r\nalso the bishops (1656). In the same year Alexander VII. issued the\r\nBull, /Ad Sanctam Petri Sedem/, by which he condemned the distinction\r\ndrawn between law and fact, and declared that the five propositions\r\nwere to be found in /Augustinus/ and were condemned in the sense in\r\nwhich they were understood by the Jansenists. The Assembly of the\r\nClergy having accepted this Bull drew up a formulary of faith based on\r\nthe teaching it contained. The greater part of the Jansenists either\r\nrefused entirely to subscribe to this formulary, or else subscribed\r\nonly with certain reservations and restrictions. The nuns at Port\r\nRoyal were most obstinate in their refusal. As they persisted in their\r\nattitude notwithstanding the prayers and entreaties of the Archbishop\r\nof Paris he was obliged reluctantly to exclude them from the\r\nsacraments. One of the principal objections urged against the\r\nacceptance of the formulary being that the Assembly of the Clergy had\r\nno authority to prescribe any such profession of faith, Alexander VII.\r\nat the request of many of the bishops issued a new constitution,\r\n/Regiminus Apostolici/ (1664), in which he insisted that all priests\r\nsecular and regular and all members of religious communities should\r\nsubscribe to the anti-Jansenist formulary that he forwarded.\r\n\r\nMost of the Jansenists refused to yield obedience even to the commands\r\nof the Pope. They were strengthened in their refusal by the fact that\r\nfour of the French bishops set them a bad example by approving\r\npublicly in their pastorals the Jansenist distinction between law and\r\nfact. The Council of State promptly suppressed these pastorals (1665),\r\nand at the request of Louis XIV. Alexander VII. appointed a commission\r\nfor the trial of the disobedient bishops. In the meantime, before the\r\ncommission could proceed with the trial, Alexander VII. died, and was\r\nsucceeded by Clement IX. (1667). Several of the French bishops\r\naddressed a joint letter to the new Pope, in which by a rather unfair\r\nuse of extracts from the works of theologians they sought to excuse\r\nthe attitude of their brother bishops, and at the same time they\r\nhinted to the king that the controversy was taking a course likely to\r\nbe fraught with great danger to the liberties of the Gallican Church.\r\nLouis XIV., who had been hitherto most determined in his efforts\r\nagainst the Jansenists, began to grow lukewarm, and the whole\r\nsituation in France was fast becoming decidedly critical. Some of the\r\nFrench bishops offered their services as mediators. Through their\r\nintervention it was agreed that without expressly retracting their\r\npastorals the bishops should consent to sign the formulary drawn up by\r\nthe Pope, and induce the clergy to do likewise. The bishops signed the\r\nformulary, and held synods in which they secured the signatures of\r\ntheir clergy, but at the same time in their conversations and in their\r\naddresses they made it perfectly clear that they had done so only with\r\nthe Jansenist restrictions and reservations. The announcement of their\r\nsubmission pure and simple was forwarded to the Pope without any\r\nreference to any conditions or qualifications, and the Pope informed\r\nthe king that he was about to issue letters of reconciliation to the\r\nfour bishops. Before the letters were forwarded, however, rumours\r\nbegan to reach Rome that all was not well, and a new investigation was\r\nordered. Finally, in view of the very critical state of affairs it was\r\ndecided that the Pope might proceed safely on the documents received\r\nfrom the nuncio and the mediators without reference to the information\r\nacquired from other sources. In January 1669 the letters of\r\nreconciliation were issued. The Jansenists hailed the /Clementine\r\nPeace/ as a great triumph for their party, and boasted publicly that\r\nClement IX. had receded from the position taken up by his predecessor,\r\nby accepting the Jansenist distinction between law and fact. That\r\ntheir boasting was without foundation is sufficiently clear from a\r\nmere cursory examination of the papal letters. The Pope makes it\r\nperfectly evident that the letters were issued on the assumption that\r\nthe bishops had subscribed without any reservation or restriction. He\r\nstates expressly that he was firmly resolved to uphold the\r\nconstitutions of his predecessors, and that he would never admit any\r\nrestriction or reservation.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] Calleawert, /Cornelius Jansenius d'Ypres, ses derniers moments, sa\r\n    soumission/, 1893.\r\n\r\n[2] Montlaur, /Angelique Arnauld/, 1902.\r\n\r\n[3] Giraud, /Pascal, l'homme, l'ouevre, l'influence/, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    (d) The Immaculate Conception.\r\n\r\n  Passaglia, /De Immaculat.

Ullathorne, /The\r\n  Immaculate Conception of the Mother of God/, 1904.\r\n\r\nFrom the days of Dons Scotus the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception\r\nwas received very generally by the universities and theologians. The\r\nDominicans, feeling themselves called upon to support the views of St.\r\nThomas, who argued against the Immaculate Conception as understood in\r\nhis own time, opposed the common teaching. The question was brought\r\nbefore the schismatical assembly at Basle (1439), where it was defined\r\nthat the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin was in harmony\r\nwith reason and Scripture, and should be approved and accepted by all\r\nChristians. This teaching was confirmed by several provincial synods\r\nin France and Germany, as well as by many of the universities. Paris\r\nand Cologne, for example, obliged all their members to swear to defend\r\nthe doctrine. Sixtus IV. bestowed indulgences on those who would\r\nobserve the Feast of the Immaculate Conception (1476), but although\r\nfavouring the doctrine he forbade the defenders or opponents to charge\r\neach other with heresy (1483). When in the discussions on Original Sin\r\nat the Council of Trent the subject was raised, no formal decision was\r\ngiven because the Fathers were determined to direct all their\r\nattention to the doctrines that had been rejected by the Reformers. At\r\nthe same time the opinion of the Fathers was expressed clearly enough,\r\nsince they declared that in their decrees regarding the universality\r\nof Original Sin they did not mean to include the Immaculate Virgin\r\nMary (V. Sess. 1546). Pius V. condemned a proposition of Baius, in\r\nwhich it was laid down that Christ alone escaped the guilt of Original\r\nSin, and that the Blessed Virgin suffered death on account of the\r\nguilt she contracted by her descent from Adam (1567). A Spanish\r\nFranciscan, Francis of Santiago, having claimed that he had a vision\r\nin support of the doctrine, a sharp controversy broke out in Spain, to\r\nend which Philip III. besought the Pope to give a definitive decision.\r\nPaul V. contented himself, however, with renewing the decrees of his\r\npredecessors Sixtus IV. and Pius V. forbidding charges of heresy to be\r\nbandied about by the disputants (1616), but in the following year he\r\nforbade any public defence of the theses directed against the doctrine\r\nof the Immaculate Conception. Gregory XV. though unwilling to yield to\r\nthe request of the Spanish Court for a formal definition, prohibited\r\neither public or private opposition to the doctrine unless in case of\r\nthose who had received special authorisation from the Holy See.\r\nFinally in 1661 Alexander VII. in the constitution, /Sollicitudo\r\nomnium Ecclesiarum/, explained the true meaning of the doctrine, and\r\nforbade any further opposition to what he declared to be the common\r\nand pious belief of the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           (e) Tyrannicide.\r\n\r\n  Hergenrother, /Katholische Kirche u.

Duhr. /Jesuiten-Fabeln/, 3 auf., pp. 659 sqq.\r\n\r\nWhether Tyrannicide is lawful or unlawful was a question on which\r\ndifferent views were held by theologians. The murder of the Duke of\r\nOrleans by orders of the Duke of Burgundy (1407) helped to stir up the\r\ncontroversy. Amongst the dependants of the Duke of Burgundy was a\r\npriest, John Parvus (Petit or Le Petit), who accompanied the Duke to\r\nParis, and in a public assembly defended the Duke of Burgundy on the\r\nground that it was lawful to murder a tyrant (1408). Nine propositions\r\nselected from this speech were condemned by the Bishop of Paris, by\r\nthe Inquisition, and by the university (1414). The Duke of Burgundy\r\nappealed to Pope John XXIII., while the representatives of France at\r\nthe Council of Constance were instructed to seek the opinion of the\r\nassembly. The discussion of the subject was complicated by political\r\nissues. As the Council of Constance was anxious to avoid all quarrels\r\nwith the King of France, the Duke of Burgundy, or the Emperor, it\r\ncontented itself with issuing a very general condemnation of\r\nTyrannicide. Before the council closed, however, the question was\r\nraised once more in connexion with a book published by the Dominican,\r\nJohn of Falkenberg, who was a strong partisan of the Teutonic Knights\r\nin their struggle against the King of Poland, and who maintained that\r\nit was lawful to kill the King of Poland. He undertook the defence of\r\nPetit's work, and wrote strongly against the representatives of the\r\nUniversity of Paris. The Poles demanded his condemnation, but though\r\nhe was arrested and detained in prison his book was not condemned by\r\nthe council. A Dominican chapter held in 1417 repudiated Falkenberg's\r\nteaching.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the subject was not discussed by Catholic theologians\r\nthough Tyrannicide was defended by the leading Reformers, including\r\nLuther and Melanchthon, but during the religious wars in France and in\r\nScotland it was advocated in theory by some of the French Calvinists\r\nsuch as Languet and Boucher as well as by the Scotch leader, John\r\nKnox, and put into practice by their followers against the Duke of\r\nGuise and Cardinal Beaton.[1] The Jesuits in France were accused of\r\nsympathising with this doctrine during the reign of Henry IV., but\r\nthere was not sufficient evidence to support such a charge. Some of\r\ntheir theologians may have defended the legality of rebellion in\r\ncertain circumstances, but this was a doctrine in no way peculiar to\r\nthe Jesuits. The only serious argument brought forward by the\r\nopponents of the Jesuits was drawn from a work published by a Spanish\r\nJesuit, Mariana (1536-1624). It was written for the instruction of\r\nsome of the princes of Spain, and was dedicated to Philip III. In many\r\nrespects it was an exceedingly praiseworthy work, but the author's\r\nreference to the murder of Henry III. of France and his defence of\r\nTyrannicide, hedged round though it was by many restrictions and\r\nreservations, gave great offence in France, and provided the enemies\r\nof the Society with a splendid weapon for a general attack upon the\r\nentire body. As a matter of fact Mariana's book did not represent the\r\nviews of the Jesuits. In 1610 the general, Aquaviva, forbade any of\r\nhis subjects to defend the teaching on Tyrannicide it contained.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] Lecky, /The History of the Rise and Influence of Rationalism in\r\n    Europe/, 1913, p. 164.\r\n\r\n\r\n             (f) The Copernican System.

He was a canon of the chapter of Frauenberg, and most\r\nprobably a priest. During his stay in Italy he was brought into\r\ncontact with the new views put forward by Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa\r\nand others regarding the position of the earth in the system of the\r\nuniverse. His own studies let him to the conclusion that the sun was\r\nthe centre round which the earth and all the heavenly bodies moved in\r\ntheir course. He communicated his conclusions to some of his special\r\nfriends in 1531, but he hesitated to publish them on account of the\r\nridicule that such a novel opinion was sure to excite. One of his\r\npupils lectured at Rome on the subject, and explained the theories of\r\nCopernicus to Clement VII. (1533).\r\n\r\nYielding at last to the entreaties of Cardinal Schonberg, Archbishop\r\nof Capua, and Bishop Giese of Culm he entrusted his work for\r\npublication to one of his pupils, Rheticus, professor at Wittenberg,\r\nbut the opposition of the Lutheran professors made it impossible to\r\nbring out the book in that city. It was finally published under the\r\neditorship of Osiander at Nurnberg in 1543. In the preface to the work\r\nOsiander made considerable changes out of deference to the views of\r\nLuther and Melanchthon, the most important of which was that he\r\nreferred to the system of Copernicus as an hypothesis that might or\r\nmight not be true. The work, /De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium/ was\r\ndedicated to Pope Paul III. The principal opposition to the novel\r\nviews of Copernicus came from the side of the Lutheran theologians,\r\nand it was only years later, when feeling was aroused by the\r\ncontroversy regarding Galileo, that any suspicion of unorthodoxy was\r\ndirected against Copernicus by Catholic writers. Needless to say\r\nCopernicus died as he had lived, a devoted Catholic, fully convinced\r\nthat he had done good service for religion as well as for science.\r\n\r\nGalileo Galilei (1564-1642) was remarkable from a very early age for\r\nhis abilities as a student of mathematics and mechanics. Indeed it was\r\nin these subjects and not in astronomy that he achieved his most\r\nbrilliant and most lasting successes. He taught at Pisa and Padua, and\r\nwas afterwards employed at the court of the Grand Duke of Tuscany. In\r\n1609 he perfected the telescope by means of which he was enabled to\r\nmake observations of the heavenly bodies, and from these observations\r\nand discoveries he was led to the conclusion that the heliocentric\r\nsystem as advocated by Copernicus was the only one scientifically\r\ntenable. He came to Rome, where he was welcomed by the Pope and the\r\ncardinals, and set up his telescope in the Vatican gardens (1611). At\r\nfirst Galileo's views excited no great opposition, but owing to the\r\nimprudent propaganda carried on by some of his own friends, notably by\r\nthe Carmelite, Foscarini, a violent controversy broke out in which the\r\nscientific side of the theory was almost completely forgotten. Against\r\nGalileo it was contended that his system contradicted the Scripture,\r\nwhich spoke of the sun standing still in its course at the prayers of\r\nJosue, and that it was, therefore, inadmissible. At the time in Italy\r\nthe ecclesiastical authorities were markedly conservative and hostile\r\nto innovations, particularly as there was then a strong party in\r\nItaly, of whom Paul Sarpi may be taken as a typical example, who were\r\nliberal and Lutheran in their tendencies and sympathies. Had the\r\ndiscussion been confined to learned circles no notice might have been\r\ntaken of it, but once an appeal was made to the masses of the people\r\nit was almost inevitable that Galileo should have been denounced to\r\nthe Inquisition.\r\n\r\nIn the circumstances a decision favourable to Galileo could hardly\r\nhave been expected. The old Ptolemaic system was so closely bound up\r\nwith the philosophic and scientific teaching of the age that its\r\nabandonment meant little less than a complete revolution in the world\r\nof learning. As yet the vast body of those who were specially versed\r\nin the subject treated the new theory with derision, while the\r\narguments put forward by Galileo in its defence were so weak and\r\ninconclusive that most of them have been long since abandoned. The\r\nhostile attitude, too, of the Lutheran divines could hardly fail to\r\nexercise some influence on the Roman consultors. In 1615 Galileo\r\nappeared before the Inquisition to defend his views, but without any\r\nresult. The heliocentric system was condemned as being opposed to\r\nScripture and therefore heretical, and Galileo was obliged to promise\r\nnever again to put it forward (1616). The work of Copernicus and those\r\nof some other writers who advocated the Copernican system were\r\ncondemned /donec corrigantur/. The decision of the congregation was\r\nwrong, but in the circumstances not unintelligible. Nor can it be\r\ncontended for a moment that from this mistake any solid argument can\r\nbe drawn against the infallibility of the Pope. Paul V. was\r\nundoubtedly present at the session in which the condemnation was\r\nagreed upon and approved of the verdict, but still the decision\r\nremained only the decision of the congregation and not the binding\r\n/ex-cathedra/ pronouncement of the Head of the Church. Indeed, it\r\nappears from a letter of Cardinal Bellarmine that the congregation\r\nregarded its teaching as only provisional, and that if it were proved\r\nbeyond doubt that the sun was stationary it would be necessary to\r\nadmit that the passages of Scripture urged against this view had been\r\nmisunderstood.\r\n\r\nGalileo left Rome with no intention of observing the promise he had\r\nmade. After the election of Urban VIII. who, as Cardinal Barberini,\r\nhad been his faithful friend and supporter, Galileo returned to Rome\r\n(1624) in the hope of procuring a revision of the verdict; but though\r\nhe was received with all honour, and accorded an annual pension from\r\nthe papal treasury his request was refused. He returned to Florence,\r\nwhere he published eight years later a new book on the subject,\r\ncouched in the form of a dialogue between supporters of the rival\r\nsystems, the Ptolemaic and the Copernican, in which Simplicissimus,\r\nthe defender of the old view, was not only routed but covered with\r\nridicule. Such a flagrant violation of his promise could not pass\r\nunnoticed. He was summoned to appear once more before the Inquisition,\r\nand arrived in Rome in February 1633. At first he denied that he had\r\nwritten in favour of his views since 1616, then he pleaded guilty,\r\nconfessed that he was in error, and appealed to the court to deal\r\ngently with an old and infirm man. He was found guilty, and was\r\ncondemned to recite the seven penitential psalms once a week for three\r\nyears, and to be imprisoned at the pleasure of the Inquisition. It is\r\nnot true to say that Galileo was shut up in the dungeons of the\r\nInquisition. He was detained only for a few days, and even during that\r\ntime he was lodged in the comfortable apartments of one of the higher\r\nofficials. Neither is it correct to state that he was tortured or\r\nsubjected to any bodily punishment. He was released almost immediately\r\non parole, and lived for a time at Rome in the palace of the Grand\r\nDuke of Tuscany. Later on he retired to his villa at Arcetri, and\r\nfinally he was allowed to return to Florence. In 1642, fortified by\r\nthe last sacraments and comforted by the papal benediction, he passed\r\naway. His body was laid to rest within the walls of the Church of\r\nSanta Croce at Florence. Most of his misfortunes were due to his own\r\nrashness and the imprudence of his friends and supporters. His\r\ncondemnation is the sole scientific blunder that can be laid to the\r\ncharge of the Roman Congregation. That his condemnation was not due to\r\nany hatred of science or to any desire of the Roman ecclesiastics to\r\noppose the progress of knowledge is evident enough from the favours\r\nand honours lavished upon his predecessors in the same field of\r\nresearch, Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa, Peurbach, Muller (Regiomontanus),\r\nand Copernicus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 (g) Progress of Theological Studies.\r\n\r\n  Hurter, /Nomenclator Literarius Theologiae Catholicae/, 3 auf.,\r\n  1903.

Yet as events\r\nshowed the results of Humanism were far from being so harmful to\r\ntheology as seemed likely at first. Zeal for the pagan authors of\r\nantiquity helped to stir up zeal for the writings of the Fathers, new\r\neditions of which were published in various centres; while at the same\r\ntime the value of the spirit of historical and literary criticism, so\r\nhighly prized by the devotees of Humanism, was recognised by\r\ntheologians, and availed of largely in defending the authority of the\r\ndocuments that they cited. In the controversies with the Reformers,\r\nwho rejected entirely the authority and the methods of the\r\nScholastics, Catholic authors and controversialists were obliged to\r\nfix their attention upon the Scriptures and on the historical side of\r\ntheology as evidenced in the doctrines and usages of the early\r\ncenturies. The revival, too, at this period of the older religious\r\norders, particularly the Benedictines and the Dominicans, and the\r\nestablishment of new bodies such as the Jesuits and the Oratorians\r\nwere in the highest degree providential. It gave to the Church the\r\nservices of trained and devoted scholars, who were free to devote all\r\ntheir energies to the defence of Catholic interests. In the remarkable\r\ntheological movement of the sixteenth century Spain and Italy held the\r\nleading place. The University of Salamanca contended with the\r\n/Collegium Romanum/ for the supremacy once yielded freely to the\r\ntheological faculty of Paris. The founder of the new school of\r\ntheology, which had its seat in Salamanca but which exercised a very\r\nconsiderable influence on the Jesuit teachers in Rome, Ingolstadt, and\r\nPrague, was the Dominican, Francis of Vittoria (1480-1546). Realising\r\nthe necessities of the age better than most of his contemporaries he\r\nput to an end the useless discussions and degenerate style of his\r\nimmediate predecessors, re-introduced the /Summa/ of St. Thomas,\r\ninsisted on supplementing it by a close study of the Scriptures and\r\nthe writings of the Fathers, and inaugurated a new style of\r\ntheological Latinity freed both from the barbarisms of the later\r\nScholastics and the pedantry of the classical enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Catholic theologians of Germany who defended the Church\r\nagainst the attacks of the Reformers may be mentioned /John Eck/\r\n(1486-1543) connected for the greater part of his life with the\r\nUniversity of Ingolstadt, who in his publications proved himself the\r\nleading champion on the Catholic side against Luther; /John Faber/\r\n(1478-1541) the friend of Erasmus and the staunch though moderate\r\nopponent of Luther and Zwingli, whose work, /Malleus Haereticorum/\r\n(1524), secured for him the title of \"the hammer of heretics\"; /John\r\nCochlaeus/ (1479-1552) who published more than two hundred treatises\r\nagainst the Reformers, nearly all of which suffered from the haste and\r\ntemper in which they were prepared; /John Gropper/ (1503-59) whose\r\nearly training as a lawyer led him at first to favour proposed\r\ncompromises hardly compatible with Catholic doctrine, but who laboured\r\nearnestly to save Cologne for the Catholic Church; /John Nas/ (1534-\r\n90) the Franciscan Bishop of Brixen, and the /Blessed Peter Canisius,\r\nS.J./ (1521-97) who did more than any other man to save the entire\r\nGerman nation from falling under the sway of Lutheranism, thereby\r\nmeriting the title of the second apostle of Germany.\r\n\r\n/Tommaso de Vio/ (1469-1534), surnamed /Cajetan/[1] from his place of\r\nbirth, /Gaeta/, joined the Dominicans at an early age, taught at Padua\r\nand Pavia, and was elected general of his order (1508). Seven years\r\nlater he was created cardinal and was entrusted with a mission to\r\nGermany (1518), in the course of which he sought vainly to procure the\r\nsubmission of Luther. During the closing years of his life he acted as\r\none of the principal advisers of Clement VII. By his example and his\r\nadvice he did much to revive theological studies amongst the\r\nDominicans and to recall them to the study of St. Thomas. As a\r\ntheologian and an exegetist he showed himself to be a man of great\r\nability and judgment sometimes slightly erratic and novel in his\r\ntheories, while from the point of view of style he was vastly superior\r\nto most of his predecessors. His principal works are the Commentary on\r\nSt. Thomas (1507-22) and his explanations of nearly all the books of\r\nthe Old and New Testament. /Ambrosius Catharinus/[2] (1487-1553) was\r\nborn at Siena, graduated a doctor of canon and civil law at the age of\r\nsixteen, pleaded as a lawyer in the consistorial court of Leo X.,\r\njoined the Dominicans at an advanced age, took a prominent part in the\r\ndiscussions at the earlier sessions of the Council of Trent, was\r\nappointed bishop in 1546, and died in 1553 when, as it is said, he was\r\non the point of receiving the cardinal's hat. Catharinus was a keen\r\ncontroversialist, but as a theologian he was brilliant rather than\r\nsolid. His strong leaning towards novelties brought him into conflict\r\nwith Cajetan and in fact with the whole Dominican Order, the most\r\ncherished opinions of which he loved to attack. /Dominic Soto/ (1494-\r\n1560) was a student of Alcala and Paris, joined the Dominicans in\r\n1524, taught theology at Salamanca from 1532 till 1545, when he went\r\nto the Council of Trent, where his services were invaluable especially\r\non the question of Grace and Justification, acted for a time as\r\nconfessor to Charles V., and returned finally to his chair at\r\nSalamanca. He was the last of the great commentators on the\r\n/Sentences/ of Peter Lombard. His principal works were /De Natura et\r\nGratia/, written for the information of the Fathers of Trent and /De\r\nJustitia et Jure/ (1556). Another of the distinguished Spanish\r\nDominicans of this period was /Melchior Cano/ (1509-60), who had as\r\nhis professor at Salamanca Francis of Vittoria. He taught at Alcala\r\nand Salamanca, accompanied Soto to the Council of Trent, was appointed\r\nbishop but resigned almost immediately, and served for some time as\r\nprovincial of the Dominicans. His greatest work was the /De Locis\r\nTheologicis/ (1563), in which as a kind of introduction to theology he\r\nendeavoured to establish scientifically the foundations of theological\r\nscience. He discusses the ten /loci/ or sources which he enumerates,\r\nnamely, Scripture, Tradition, the Catholic Church, the Councils, the\r\nFathers, the Roman Church, the Scholastics, Reason, the authority of\r\nphilosophers, and the authority of historians. His style is simple,\r\nconcise, and elegant.\r\n\r\n/Robert Bellarmine/[3] (1542-1621) was born in Tuscany, joined the\r\nSociety of Jesus (1560), studied at the /Collegium Romanum/ and at\r\nLouvain, where he taught for some time, was recalled to Rome to assume\r\ncharge of the new chair of controversy in the /Collegium Romanum/,\r\ntook a prominent part in the preparation of the Clementine edition of\r\nthe Vulgate, in the /Congregatio de Auxiliis/, and in the trial of\r\nGalileo, engaged in controversy with James I. of England in regard to\r\nthe Catholic Oath, was created cardinal (1599), and appointed\r\nArchbishop of Capua (1602). Cardinal Bellarmine was a deeply religious\r\nman, severe only with himself, an indefatigable student always anxious\r\nto be just to his opponents, and specially gifted as a lecturer and\r\nwriter. His greatest work was undoubtedly the /Disputationes de\r\ncontroversis Christianae fidei articulis/, in which he displayed a\r\nmost minute and accurate knowledge of the religious tenets of all the\r\nsects of the Reformers. The book created such an enormous sensation in\r\nEurope at the time that special lecturers were employed at some of the\r\nProtestant universities to undertake its refutation. His commentary on\r\nthe Psalms, and the Catechism prepared by him at the request of\r\nClement VIII. also deserve special notice. The last complete edition\r\nof his writings was published at Paris in 1870. /Francis Suarez/[4]\r\n(1548-1617) was born at Granada, joined the Society of Jesus in\r\nSalamanca (1564) and taught at Valladolid, Rome, Alcala, Salamanca,\r\nand Coimbra. Like Bellarmine Suarez was a man of great personal piety,\r\nwell versed in the writings of the Fathers and in the literature of\r\nthe Reformers. His works are clear and well arranged but somewhat too\r\ndiffuse. The last edition (Vives) of his works was published at Paris\r\n(1856-61). /John de Lugo/ (1583-1660) was born at Madrid, went to\r\nSalamanca to study law, and there joined the Jesuits. He lectured\r\nfirst at Valladolid, and later on at Rome where he attracted crowds of\r\nstudents, and he was created cardinal in 1643. In his works he has\r\ncovered practically the entire field of dogmatic and moral theology.\r\nThe best known are perhaps /De Justitia et Jure/ and his treatises on\r\nthe Incarnation, the Sacraments, the Eucharist, and the Sacrifice of\r\nthe Mass. The last edition of his published works was issued at Paris\r\n(1868-9). /Dionysius Petavius/[5] (Petau, 1583-1652) was born at\r\nOrleans, studied arts and theology at Paris, entered the Society of\r\nJesus (1605), and taught theology at Paris for twenty-two years. He\r\nwas one of the best known and most respected scholars of his age.\r\nQuite apart from his merits as a theologian, his works on chronology,\r\nnotably the /De doctrina temporum/ and the /Tabulae Chronologicae/\r\nwould have been sufficient to place him in the first rank of the\r\nscholars of his period. In theology he is chiefly remarkable for the\r\nintroduction and application of the historical method in his\r\ndiscussion of dogma, and hence he is referred to rightly as the\r\n\"Father of the History of Dogma.\" His principal theological work is\r\nthe /Dogmata Theologica/ (1644-50).\r\n\r\nThe splendid example of a scientific treatment of moral theology set\r\nby St. Thomas produced very little effect during the fourteenth and\r\nfifteenth centuries, for the simple reason that the /Sentences/, and\r\nnot the /Summa/, was the text-book used generally in the schools.\r\nFollowing along the lines marked out by Raymond of Penafort in his\r\n/Summa de poenitentia et matrimonio/ (1235) a large number of /Summae/\r\nor manuals for the use of confessors were published during the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the last of them being that of\r\nSilvester Prierias, one of the earliest opponents of Luther. One of\r\nthe few writers of this period who undertook to give a scientific\r\nexplanation of moral principles is St. Antoninus (1389-1459), the\r\nDominican Archbishop of Florence, in his /Summa Theologica Moralis/.\r\n\r\nThe rejection of the /Sentences/ in favour of the /Summa/, and the\r\nreform decrees of the Council of Trent gave a new impetus to the study\r\nof moral theology during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Most\r\nof the great writers of this period, Gregory of Valencia (1550-1603),\r\nVasquez (1549-1604), Lessius (1554-1623), Banez (1528-1604), Medina\r\n(1527-81), Sanchez (1550-1610), Saurez, and De Logo devoted special\r\nattention to the underlying principles of moral theology, and in some\r\ncases to their practical application. The /De Poenitentia/ and the\r\n/Responsa Moralia/ of De Lugo served as models of what might be called\r\nmixed treatment, partly scientific and partly casuistical. The\r\n/Theologia Moralis/ of the Jesuit writer, Paul Laymann (1574-1635),\r\nthe /Instructio Sacerdotum/ of Cardinal Toledo and the /Medulla\r\nTheologiae Moralis/ of Hermann Busenbaum (1600-68), which went through\r\nforty editions in his own lifetime, may be cited as examples of this\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\nThe controversy regarding Probabilism did not assume a serious aspect\r\ntill the rise and condemnation of Jansenism. During this period the\r\nenemies of the Jesuits pointed to the approval given to Probabilism by\r\nthe Fathers of the Society as a proof of the laxity of view introduced\r\nby Jesuit theologians. Whatever may be said of the system, one thing\r\nis certain, namely, that the Jesuit theologians were not the first to\r\nput it forward. It was followed in practice long before the\r\ninstitution of the Society of Jesus, was enunciated clearly enough as\r\na theory by the Spanish Dominican Bartholomew Medina (1527-81) and was\r\nadopted, at least in their solutions of particular cases, by most of\r\nthe great writers during the latter half of the sixteenth and the\r\nfirst half of the seventeenth centuries.\r\n\r\nAmongst the most notable writers on ascetical theology of this period\r\nwere St. Ignatius of Loyola, the author of the /Spiritual Exercises/,\r\nSt. Teresa (1515-82) the zealous reformer of the Carmelites, St. John\r\nof God (1495-1550) the founder of the Brothers of St. John of God, the\r\nDominican Louis of Granada (1504-88), St. Francis de Sales (1567-\r\n1622), the two Jesuit writers Alphonsus Rodriguez (1526-1616) and\r\nLouis de Ponte (1554-1624), and Jean Jacques Olier (1608-57) the\r\nfounder of the Sulpicians.\r\n\r\nMany causes combined to bring about a great revival in Scriptural\r\nstudies. The Humanist movement ensured that commentators would bring\r\nto their task a ready knowledge of Greek and a critical appreciation\r\nof the age and value of manuscripts. The study of Hebrew was taken up\r\nenthusiastically by scholars like Reuchlin, and was rendered\r\ncomparatively easy by the grammars and dictionaries published by\r\nReuchlin, Santez, Pagnino, Pelikan, and Cardinal Bellarmine. The\r\ncontention of the early Reformers that the Bible was the sole source\r\nof divine revelation, though never accepted by Catholic scholars,\r\nnecessitated a close study of the words and literal meaning of the\r\nsacred text. In opposition to the private interpretation of the\r\nReformers Catholics contended that the teaching authority of the\r\nChurch and the interpretation of the Fathers were the only sure\r\nguides. The distinction between deutero-canonical and proto-canonical\r\nbooks was ended for Catholics by the decision of the Council of Trent\r\nattributing to both equal authority. The question of the extent of\r\ninspiration was left by the Council of Trent practically in the\r\nposition in which it stood when the Council of Florence defined that\r\nGod was the author of the sacred books. Many writers were inclined to\r\nhold the view that the divine assistance extended to the style and the\r\nwords, while others rejected verbal inspiration. A few Catholic\r\nscholars, for example Lessius and Hamel, seemed to maintain that a\r\nbook composed by human industry and without the assistance of the Holy\r\nGhost might be regarded as inspired if afterwards the Holy Ghost\r\ntestified that it contained no error. Since the Vatican Council such a\r\nview is no longer tenable.\r\n\r\nThe activity in the field of Scriptural studies is witnessed to by the\r\nedition of the Greek and Latin text of the New Testament prepared by\r\nErasmus, by the Complutensian Polyglot published under the direction\r\nof Cardinal Ximenes (1514-17) to be followed by similar publications\r\nat Antwerp (1569-72) and at Paris (1628-45), by the edition of the\r\nSeptuagint at the command of Sixtus V. and the edition of the Vulgate\r\nunder Clement VIII. Amongst the great Catholic commentators of the age\r\nmay be mentioned Cardinal Cajetan (+1534), the Dominican Santez\r\nPagnino (+1541), Cornelius Jansen (1576), the Jesuit, John Maldonatus\r\n(+1583), whose commentary on the four Gospels is still unrivalled,\r\nWilliam Estius (+1613), professor at Douay, whose views on Grace were\r\nnot unaffected by the controversies then raging at Louvain, and\r\nCornelius a Lapide, S.J. (+1673), professor at Louvain and Rome, who\r\npublished an excellent commentary on the entire Scriptures.\r\n\r\nEcclesiastical History profited largely from the Humanist movement\r\nwhich brought to light many new documents, and tended to awaken a\r\nspirit of scholarly criticism. The contention put forward by the\r\nReformers, that primitive Christianity had been completely corrupted\r\nby semi-Pagan novelties during the Middle Ages, made it imperative on\r\nCatholic scholars to direct their attention to the practices and\r\nteaching of the early centuries. New editions of the writings of the\r\nFathers were prepared by the Dominicans, Jesuits, and by the\r\nBenedictines of St. Maur. The attempt made by the Magdeburg\r\nCenturiators to justify Lutheranism at the bar of history called forth\r\nthe /Annales Ecclesiastici/ of Cardinal Baronius (1538-1607). These\r\nAnnals dealt with the history of the Church from the beginning till\r\nthe year 1198. The work was continued by the Oratorians Raynaldus and\r\nLaderchi, by de Sponde, Bzovius and Augustine Theiner. The History of\r\nthe Popes was written by the Augustinian Panvinio (+1568) and by the\r\nDominican, Ciacconius (+1599). Hagiographical studies were pursued by\r\nSurius (+1578) and by the Jesuit Heribert Rosweyde (1569-1629). It was\r\nthe latter who first conceived the plan of publishing the Lives of the\r\nSaints in one series. He died without having done much except to\r\ncollect an immense mass of materials. The scheme was, however, taken\r\nup by other members of the society, notably, John Van Bolland\r\n(Bollandus, 1596-1665), Godfrey Henschen (1601-81) and Daniel von\r\nPapenbroeck (Papebroch, 1628-1714). These were the first of the\r\nBollandists, and the first volume of the /Acta Sanctorum/ appeared in\r\n1643.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] Quetif-Echard, /Scriptores Ordinis Praedicatorum/, ii. 14.\r\n\r\n[2] Id., ii. 144-51.\r\n\r\n[3] Couderc, /Robert Bellarmin/, 2 vols., 1893.\r\n\r\n[4] Werner, /Franz Suarez und die Scholastik der letzten\r\n    jahrhunderte/, 1861.\r\n\r\n[5] Chatellain, /Viz du Pere D.

The Protestant reformers appealed to the civil\r\nrulers for assistance against the ecclesiastical authorities, and in\r\nreturn for the aid given to them so generously they were willing to\r\nconcede to the king all power in civil and ecclesiastical matters.\r\nThenceforth the princes were to be so supreme in spirituals as well as\r\nin temporals that their right to determine the religion of their\r\nsubjects was recognised as a first principle of government. During the\r\ndays of the Counter-Reformation, when religious enthusiasm was aroused\r\nto its highest pitch, the Catholic sovereigns of Europe fought not so\r\nmuch for the aggrandisement of their own power as for the unity of\r\ntheir kingdoms and the defence of the religion of their fathers,\r\nthreatened as it was with complete overthrow.\r\n\r\nBut once the first fervour had passed away, and once it was recognised\r\nthat religious harmony could not be secured by the sword, Catholic\r\nsovereigns began to understand that the Protestant theory of state\r\nsupremacy meant an increase of power to the crown, and might be\r\nutilised to reduce the only partially independent institution in their\r\nkingdoms to a state of slavery. Hence they increased their demands,\r\ninterfered more and more in ecclesiastical matters, set themselves to\r\ndiminish the jurisdiction of the Pope by means of the /Royal Placet/\r\nand other such legal contrivances, and asserted for themselves as much\r\nauthority as could be reconciled with Catholic principles interpreted\r\nin their most liberal sense. They urged the bishops to assert their\r\nindependence against the Holy See, and the bishops, forgetful of the\r\nfact that freedom from Rome meant enslavement by the State,\r\nco-operated willingly in carrying out the programme of their royal\r\nmasters. Men like Bossuet, carried away by the new theories of the\r\ndivine right of kings, aimed at reducing the power of Rome to a\r\nshadow. They were more anxious to be considered national patriots than\r\ngood Catholics. They understood only when it was too late that in\r\ntheir close union with the Holy See lay their only hope of resisting\r\nstate aggression, and that by weakening the authority of the Pope they\r\nwere weakening the one power that could defend their own rights and\r\nthe rights of the Church. Their whole policy tended to the realisation\r\nof the system of national churches, and were it not for the divine\r\nprotection guaranteed by Christ to the society that He Himself had\r\nfounded, their policy might have been crowned with success.\r\n\r\nThe principle, too, of individual judgment introduced by the Reformers\r\nwas soon pushed to its logical conclusions. If by means of this\r\nprinciple Luther and his disciples could reject certain doctrines and\r\npractices that had been followed for centuries by the whole Catholic\r\nChurch, why could not others, imitating the example that had been\r\ngiven to them, set aside many of the dogmas retained by Luther as\r\nbeing only the inventions of men, and why could their successors not\r\ngo further still, and question the very foundation of Christianity\r\nitself? The results of this unbridled liberty of thought made\r\nthemselves felt in religion, in philosophy, in politics, in\r\nliterature, and in art. Rationalism became fashionable in educated\r\ncircles, at the courts, and at the universities. Even Catholics who\r\nstill remained loyal to the Church were not uninfluenced by the spirit\r\nof religious indifference. It seemed to them that many of the dogmas\r\nand devotions of the Church were too old-fashioned, and required to be\r\nmodernised. The courts in many cases favoured the spread of these\r\nanti-religious views because they meant the weakening of the power of\r\nthe Church. They joined with the apostles of rationalism in attacking\r\nthe Society of Jesus, because the rationalists realised that the\r\nJesuits were their strongest opponents, while the politicians believed\r\nthem to be the most strenuous supporters of the jurisdiction of Rome.\r\nIt was only when the storm of revolution was about to burst over\r\nEurope that the civil rulers understood fully the dangerous tendency\r\nof the movement which they had encouraged. They began to open their\r\neyes to the fact that war against Christianity meant war against\r\nestablished authority, and that the unbridled liberty of thought and\r\nspeech which had been tolerated was likely to prove more dangerous to\r\nthe cause of monarchy than to the cause of religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           (a) Gallicanism.\r\n\r\n  Richer, /De ecclesiastica et politica potestate/, 1611.

From the days of Clovis the French nation had never\r\nwavered in its allegiance to the successors of Saint Peter, many of\r\nwhom had been obliged to seek refuge on the soil of France. In return\r\nfor this support given ungrudgingly in many a dangerous crisis,\r\nseveral important privileges were conferred by the Popes on the French\r\nrulers, in which privileges moderate supporters of Gallicanism were\r\ninclined to seek the origin and best explanation of the so-called\r\nGallican Liberties. But the extreme Gallicans, realising that such a\r\ndefence could avail but little against the Pope, who could recall what\r\nhis predecessors had granted, maintained that the Gallican Liberties\r\nwere but the survival of the liberty possessed by individual churches\r\nin the early centuries, that these liberties had been restricted\r\ngradually by the Holy See, which succeeded in reducing the national\r\nchurches to servitude, and that the French Church alone had withstood\r\nthese assaults, and had maintained intact the discipline and\r\nconstitution of the apostolic age. The rulers of France, well aware\r\nthat every restriction upon the authority of the Church meant an\r\nincrease of the power of the Crown, gladly fostered this movement,\r\nwhile the French bishops, unconscious of the fact that independence of\r\nRome meant servitude to the king, allowed themselves to be used as\r\ntools in carrying out the programme of state absolutism.\r\n\r\nThe Pragmatic Sanction of Louis IX., referred to by many writers as\r\nthe first indication of Gallicanism, is admitted by all scholars to be\r\na forgery. The exorbitant demands formulated by Philip the Fair during\r\nhis quarrel with Boniface VIII. are the first clear indication of the\r\nGallican theory that confronts the historian. The principles laid down\r\nby the rulers of France during this quarrel were amplified\r\nconsiderably in the writings of William of Occam, Jean of Jandun, and\r\nMarsilius of Padua, and were reduced to definite form in the time of\r\nthe Great Western Schism. At that time, mainly owing to the influence\r\nof Gerson, D'Ailly, and other French leaders, the doctrine of the\r\nsuperiority of a General Council over the Pope was accepted, and\r\nreceived official confirmation in the decrees of the fourth and fifth\r\nsessions of the Council of Constance (1414-17), and in the Council of\r\nBasle (1431-6). The decrees passed by the Synod of Bourges (1438) were\r\nstrongly anti-papal, and despite of the efforts of Nicholas V. and his\r\nsuccessors to procure their withdrawal most of them remained in force\r\ntill the Concordat of 1516. Partly owing to this Concordat, by which\r\nthe right of nomination to all bishoprics and abbacies in France was\r\nsecured to the Crown, and partly to the strong feeling aroused in\r\nFrance during the conflict with Calvinism, little was heard of\r\nGallicanism during the sixteenth century. It was mainly, however, as a\r\nresult of the opposition of the French bishops that the decree of the\r\nCouncil of Florence regarding papal supremacy was not renewed at the\r\nCouncil of Trent, and it was in great measure due to the influence of\r\nGallican principles that the decrees of the Council of Trent were not\r\nreceived in France for years.\r\n\r\nGallicanism was renewed in the beginning of the seventeenth century by\r\nEdmund Richer (1559-1631), syndic of the Paris University and editor\r\nof the works of Gerson. He was a man who held novel views about the\r\nconstitution both of Church and State, and who professed his sincere\r\nadmiration for Gerson's exposition of the relations that should exist\r\nbetween a General Council and the Pope. In 1610 one of the Dominican\r\nstudents undertook to defend publicly the supremacy and infallibility\r\nof the Pope, whereupon a violent controversy broke out, but it was\r\nsettled for a time by the prudent intervention of Cardinal Du Perron.\r\nThe Parliament of Paris, however, undertook the defence of Richer and\r\nof the work that he published in explanation of his theories. In this\r\nbook, /De Ecclesiastica et Politica Potestate/ (1611) he laid it down\r\nthat the Church was a limited not an absolute monarchy; that the whole\r\nlegislative power rested in the hands of the hierarchy, composed\r\naccording to him of both bishops and parish priests; that this\r\nlegislative power should be exercised in a General Council, which as\r\nrepresenting the entire hierarchy was the repository of infallibility,\r\nand was not subject to the Pope; that the power of executing the\r\ndecrees of General Councils and of carrying on the administration of\r\nthe Church rested in the hands of the Pope, who could not act contrary\r\nto the canons; that neither Pope nor hierarchy could undertake to\r\nenforce ecclesiastical decrees by any other means except persuasion;\r\nand that if force were required it could be exercised only by the head\r\nof the State, who was the natural protector of the Church, and\r\nresponsible to God for the due observance of the canons.\r\n\r\nThis book was condemned by the provincial Synod of Sens, held under\r\nthe presidency of Cardinal Du Perron in 1612, by the provincial Synod\r\nof Aix, by the Bishop of Paris, and by the Pope. The Parliament of\r\nParis, however, supported Richer, who lodged an appeal with the civil\r\nauthorities against the action of the bishops, and sought to secure\r\nfor his theories the support of the Sorbonne. Though forced by the\r\nking to resign his office at the University he continued to defend his\r\nviews stubbornly till 1629, when for political rather than for\r\nreligious reasons he was called upon by Cardinal Richelieu to sign a\r\ncomplete recantation. Shortly before his death in 1631 he declared in\r\nthe presence of several witnesses that this submission was made freely\r\nand from conviction, but some papers written by him and discovered\r\nafter his death make it very difficult to believe that these\r\nprotestations were sincere.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Pithou, Richer, and Dupuy, and above all the rising\r\ninfluence of the Jansenist party helped to spread the Gallican\r\nteaching among the French clergy, and to make them more willing to\r\nyield obedience to the king than to the Pope. The Abbot of St. Cyran\r\nattacked the authority of the Holy See, but fortunately the extreme\r\nnature of his views, and the need felt by both the priests and the\r\nbishops of France for the intervention of the Holy See against the\r\nJansenists, served to restrain the anti-papal feeling, and to keep the\r\nleading theological writers, like Duval, Du Perron, Ysambert and\r\nAbelly, free from any Gallican bias. The accession of Louis XIV.\r\n(1661) marked a new era in the history of the Gallican Liberties. He\r\nwas young, headstrong, anxious to extend the territories of France,\r\nand determined to assert his own supreme authority at all costs. With\r\nLouis XIV. firmly seated on the French throne, and with the Jansenist\r\nparty intriguing in the Parliament of Paris, which had shown itself\r\nhostile to papal claims, it was not difficult to predict that the\r\nrelations with the Holy See were likely to become unfriendly. The Duke\r\nof Crequi,[1] Louis XIV.'s ambassador at Rome, set himself\r\ndeliberately to bring about a complete rupture. Owing to an attack\r\nmade by some Corsicans of the papal guard on the French embassy, the\r\nambassador refused to accept any apology and left Rome, while Louis\r\nXIV. dismissed the nuncio at Paris, occupied the papal territories of\r\nAvignon and Venaissin, and despatched an army against the Papal\r\nStates. Alexander VII. was obliged to yield to force, and to accept\r\nthe very humiliating terms imposed upon him by the Peace of Pisa\r\n(1664).\r\n\r\nThe Jansenist party and the enemies of the Holy See took advantage of\r\nthe policy of Louis XIV. to push forward their designs. A violent\r\nclamour was raised in 1661 against a thesis defended in the Jesuit\r\nschools (/Thesis Claromontana/) in favour of papal infallibility, and\r\na still more violent clamour ensued when it was maintained in a public\r\ndefence at the Sorbonne (1663) that the Pope has supreme jurisdiction\r\nover the Church, and that General Councils, though useful for the\r\nsuppression of heresy, are not necessary. The Jansenist party appealed\r\nto the Parliament of Paris, which issued a prohibition against\r\nteaching or defending the doctrine of papal infallibility, but the\r\nmajority of the doctors of the Sorbonne stood by their opinion, and\r\nrefused to register the decree of Parliament. The opponents of the\r\nSorbonne, hastening to avenge this first defeat, denounced the defence\r\nof a somewhat similar thesis by a Cistercian student as a violation of\r\nthe prohibition. The syndic of the university was suspended from his\r\noffice for six months, and the university itself was threatened with\r\nvery serious reforms unless it consented to accept the Gallican\r\ntheories. As a result of the interference of intermediaries a\r\ndeclaration satisfactory to the Parliament was issued by the doctors\r\nof the faculty (1663). In this document they announced that it was not\r\nthe teaching of the university that the Pope had any authority over\r\nthe king in temporal matters, that he was superior to a General\r\nCouncil, or that he was infallible in matters of faith without the\r\nconsent of a General Council. On the contrary, they asserted that it\r\nwas the teaching of the university that in temporal affairs the king\r\nwas subject only to God, that his subjects could not be dispensed from\r\ntheir allegiance to him by any power on earth, and that the rights and\r\nliberties of the Gallican Church must be respected. This decree was\r\nsigned by seventy-seven doctors, and was published by the Parliament\r\nas the teaching of the entire theological faculty and as a guide that\r\nshould be followed in all theological schools. A violent agitation was\r\nbegun against all who attempted to uphold the rights of the Holy See\r\neither in public disputations or in published works, an agitation that\r\nwas all the more inexplicable, owing to the fact that at this time\r\nboth the king and Parliament were endeavouring to persuade the\r\nJansenists to accept as infallible the decrees by which the Pope had\r\ncondemned their teaching.\r\n\r\nBefore this agitation had died away a new cause of dissension had come\r\nto the front in the shape of the /Regalia/. By the term /Regalia/ was\r\nmeant the right of the King of France to hold the revenues of vacant\r\nSees and abbacies, and to appoint to benefices during the vacancy, and\r\nuntil the oath of allegiance had been taken by the new bishops and had\r\nbeen registered. Such a privilege was undoubtedly bad for religion,\r\nand though it was tolerated for certain grave reasons by the second\r\nGeneral Council of Lyons (1274), a decree of excommunication was\r\nlevelled against anyone, prince or subject, cleric or layman, who\r\nwould endeavour to introduce it or to abet its introduction into those\r\nplaces where it did not already exist. Many of the provinces of France\r\nhad not been subject to the /Regalia/ hitherto, but in defiance of the\r\nlaw of the Church Louis XIV. issued a royal mandate (1673-75),\r\nclaiming for himself the /Regalia/ in all dioceses of France, and\r\ncommanding bishops who had not taken the oath of allegiance to take it\r\nimmediately and to have it registered.\r\n\r\nThe bishops of France submitted to this decree with two exceptions.\r\nThese were Pavillon, bishop of Alet, and Caulet, bishop of Pamiers,\r\nboth of whom though attached to the Jansenist party were determined to\r\nmaintain the rights of the Church. The king, regardless of their\r\nprotests, proceeded to appoint to benefices in their dioceses on the\r\nground that they had not registered their oath of allegiance. They\r\nreplied by issuing excommunication against all those who accepted such\r\nappointments, and, when their censures were declared null and void by\r\ntheir respective metropolitans, they appealed to the Holy See. During\r\nthe contest Pavillon of Alet died, and the whole brunt of the struggle\r\nfell upon his companion. The latter was encouraged by the active\r\nassistance of Innocent XI., who quashed the sentence of the\r\nmetropolitans, encouraged the bishop and chapter to resist, and\r\nthreatened the king with the censures of the Church unless he desisted\r\nfrom his campaign (1678-79). The bishop himself died, but the chapter\r\nshowed its loyalty to his injunctions by appointing a vicar-capitular\r\nin opposition to the vicar-capitular nominated by the king. A most\r\nviolent persecution was begun against the vicar-capitular and the\r\nclergy who remained loyal to him. Both on account of the important\r\ninterests at stake and the courage displayed by the opponents of the\r\nking the contest was followed with great interest not only in France\r\nitself but throughout the Catholic world. While feeling was thus\r\nrunning high another event happened in Paris that added fuel to the\r\nflame. The Cistercian nuns at Charonne were entitled according to\r\ntheir constitution to elect their own superioress, but de Harlay,\r\nArchbishop of Paris, acting in conformity with the orders of Louis\r\nXIV. endeavoured to force upon the community a superioress belonging\r\nto an entirely different order. The nuns appealed to Innocent XI., who\r\nannulled the appointment and insisted upon a free canonical election\r\n(1680). The Parliament of Paris set side the papal sentence, and when\r\nthis interference was rejected by the Pope, the papal document was\r\nsuppressed.\r\n\r\nIn view of the difficulties that had arisen an extraordinary meeting\r\nof the bishops of France was summoned. Fifty-two of them met in Paris\r\n(March-May, 1681). The two leading men in favour of the king were\r\nFrancis de Harlay, Archbishop of Paris, and Le Tellier, Archbishop of\r\nRheims. Acting under the influence of these men the bishops agreed\r\nthat it was their duty to submit to the claims of the crown in regard\r\nto the /Regalia/; they condemned the interference of the Pope in\r\nfavour of the Paris community of Cistercian nuns as well as his action\r\nagainst the metropolitan of the Bishop of Pamiers; and they expressed\r\nthe opinion that a general assembly of the clergy of France should be\r\ncalled to discuss the whole situation.\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly consisting of thirty-four bishops and thirty-\r\nseven priests elected to represent the entire body of the French\r\nclergy met at Paris (October 1681-July 1682). The most prominent men\r\nof the Assembly were Francis de Harlay of Paris, Le Tellier of Rheims,\r\nColbert of Rouen, Choisseul of Tournay, and Bossuet, the recently\r\nappointed Bishop of Meaux. The latter, whose reputation as a preacher\r\nhad already spread throughout France, delivered the opening address,\r\nwhich was moderate in tone, and not unfriendly to the rights of the\r\nHoly See though at the same time strongly pro-Gallican. Certain minor\r\nrights claimed by the king having been abandoned, the bishops\r\ngratefully accepted the /Regalia/, and despatched a letter to the Pope\r\nurging him to yield to the royal demands for the sake of peace. But\r\nthe Pope, more concerned for the liberty of the French bishops than\r\nthey were themselves, reminded them sharply of their duty to the\r\nChurch, while at the same time he refused to follow their advice. In\r\ntheir reply to the Pope the bishops took occasion to praise the spirit\r\nof religious zeal shown by Louis XIV., who, according to them, was\r\nforced reluctantly to take up the gauge of battle that had been thrown\r\nat his feet by Rome. Meantime an attempt was made by the Assembly to\r\nformulate definitely the Gallican liberties. These were:--\r\n\r\n(1) That Saint Peter and his successors have received jurisdiction\r\nonly over spiritual things. Kings are not subject to them in temporal\r\nmatters, nor can the subjects of kings be released from their oath of\r\nallegiance by the Pope.\r\n\r\n(2) That the plenitude of power in spiritual things by the Holy See\r\ndoes not contradict the decrees of the fourth and fifth sessions of\r\nthe Council of Constance, which decrees, having been passed by a\r\nGeneral Council and approved by the Pope, were observed by the\r\nGallican church.\r\n\r\n(3) That the apostolic authority of the Roman Church must be exercised\r\nin accordance with the canons inspired by the Holy Ghost, and with the\r\nrules, constitutions, and customs of the Gallican Church.\r\n\r\n(4) That though the Pope has the chief part in determining questions\r\nof faith, and though his decrees have force in the entire Church and\r\nin each particular church, yet his decisions are not irreformable, at\r\nleast until they are approved by the verdict of the entire Church.\r\n\r\nThis Declaration (the Four Gallican Articles) was approved by the\r\nking, who ordered that it should be observed by all teachers and\r\nprofessors, and should be accepted by all candidates for theological\r\ndecrees. Although the Archbishop of Paris recommended warmly the\r\nacceptance of the Gallican Articles the doctors of the Sorbonne\r\noffered strong opposition to the new royal theology, so that it was\r\nonly after recourse had been had to the most violent expedients that\r\nthe consent of one hundred and sixty-two doctors could be obtained,\r\nwhile the majority against the Gallican Articles was over five\r\nhundred. The decision of the minority was published as the decision of\r\nthe faculty, and steps were taken at once to remove the opponents of\r\nthe articles, and to make the Sorbonne strongly Gallican in its\r\nteaching. While protests against the articles poured in from different\r\nuniversities and from many of the countries of Europe the Pope kept\r\nsilent; but when two priests, who took part in the Assembly of 1682,\r\nwere nominated for vacant bishoprics Innocent XI. refused to appoint\r\nthem until they should have expressed regret for their action. The\r\nking would not permit them to do so, nor would he allow the others who\r\nwere nominated to accept their appointments from the Pope, and as a\r\nresult in 1688 thirty-five of the French Sees had been left without\r\nbishops.\r\n\r\nIn this same year another incident occurred that rendered the\r\nrelations between the Pope and Louis XIV. even more strained. The\r\nright of asylum possessed by various ambassadors at the papal court\r\nhad become a very serious abuse. Formerly it was attached only to the\r\nresidence of the ambassador, but in the course of time it was extended\r\nuntil it included the whole of the quarter in which the embassy was\r\nsituated, with the result that it became impossible for the guardians\r\nof the peace to carry out their duties. For this reason the right of\r\nasylum was suppressed by the Pope. All the other nations submitted to\r\nsuch a reasonable restriction, but Louis XIV., anxious rather to\r\nprovoke than to avoid a quarrel, refused to abandon the privilege. He\r\nsent as his ambassador to Rome (1687) the Marquis de Lavardin, who\r\nentered Rome at the head of a force of five hundred armed men, and\r\nwhose conduct from first to last was so outrageous that Innocent XI.\r\nwas obliged to excommunicate him, and to lay the Church of Saint Louis\r\nunder interdict. Immediately Louis XIV. occupied Avignon and\r\nVenaissin, assembled an army in Southern France to be despatched\r\nagainst the Papal States, and ordered that an appeal to a future\r\nGeneral Council should be prepared for presentation. Twenty-six of the\r\nbishops expressed their approval of this appeal, and so successful had\r\nbeen the dragooning of the university that nearly all the faculties\r\nadopted a similar attitude (1688).\r\n\r\nFor a time it seemed as if a schism involving the whole of the French\r\nChurch was unavoidable, since neither Pope nor king seemed willing to\r\ngive way. But Louis XIV. had no wish to become a second Henry VIII.\r\nThe threatening condition of affairs in Europe made it impossible for\r\nhim to despatch an army against Rome. At the same time the fear of\r\ncivil disturbance in France in case he rejected completely the\r\nauthority of the Pope, and the danger that such a step might involve\r\nfor French interests abroad kept him from taking the final plunge. He\r\nrecalled the obnoxious ambassador from Rome (1689), abandoned the\r\nright of asylum as attached to the quarter of the French embassy\r\n(1690), and restored Avignon and Venaissin to the Pope. Alexander\r\nVIII. demanded the withdrawal of the royal edict of March 1683\r\nenjoining the public acceptance of the Gallican Articles. He required\r\nalso a retraction from the clergy who had taken part in the Assembly,\r\nand issued a Bull denouncing the extension of the rights of the\r\n/Regalia/ and declaring the Gallican Articles null and void (1690).\r\nLouis XIV., finding that the public opinion of the Catholic world was\r\nagainst him, and that a reconciliation with the Papacy would be very\r\nhelpful to him in carrying out his political schemes, opened friendly\r\nnegotiations with Innocent XII. In the end an agreement was arrived\r\nat, whereby the clerics who had taken part in the Assembly of 1682,\r\nhaving expressed their regret to the Pope for their action, were\r\nappointed to the bishoprics for which they had been nominated; while\r\nthe king informed the Pope (1693) that the decrees issued by him\r\ninsisting on the acceptance of the Gallican Articles, would not be\r\nenforced.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of this royal assurance, Gallicanism had still a strong\r\nhold upon France. The younger men in the Sorbonne could be relied upon\r\nto support the Articles, and the influence of writers like John de\r\nLaunoy (1603-1678) and of Dupin helped to spread Gallicanism among the\r\nclergy and laymen of the rising generation. Throughout the whole\r\ncontroversy Bossuet had shown himself too accommodating to the crown,\r\nthough at the same time he was not unfriendly to the claims of the\r\nHoly See, nor inclined to favour such extreme measures as most of his\r\nepiscopal colleagues. Acting on the request of the king he prepared a\r\ndefence of the Gallican Articles, which was not published till long\r\nafter his death. During the eighteenth century, when the crown and the\r\nParliament of Paris interfered constantly in all religious questions,\r\nthe bishops and clergy of France had good reason to regret their\r\ndefence of the so-called Gallican Liberties. The Concordat concluded\r\nby Napoleon with Pius VII. and the action taken by the Pope with the\r\napproval of Napoleon for the carrying out of the Concordat dealt a\r\nstaggering blow to Gallicanism, despite the attempt made to revive it\r\nby the Organic Articles. The great body of the bishops of the\r\nnineteenth century had little sympathy with Gallican principles, which\r\ndisappeared entirely after the definition of Papal Infallibility at\r\nthe Vatican Council.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] De Mouy, /L'ambassade du duc de Crequi/, 2 vols., 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   (b) Febronianism and Josephism.\r\n\r\n  Febronius, /De statu ecclesiae deque legitima potestate Romani\r\n  Pontificis/, etc., 1762.

The violent onslaughts of\r\nthe Reformers and the imminent danger of heresy had driven the\r\nCatholics of Germany to cling more closely to the Holy See, and had\r\nhelped to extinguish the anti-Roman feeling, that had been so strong\r\nin the early years of the sixteenth century. But once the religious\r\nwars had ended without a decisive victory for either party, and once\r\nthe theory of imperial neutrality had been sanctioned formally by the\r\nPeace of Westphalia (1648), the Catholic rulers of Germany, not\r\nexcluding even the spiritual princes, showed more anxiety to increase\r\ntheir own power than to safeguard the interests of their religion. The\r\nexample of the Protestant states, where the rulers were supreme in\r\nreligious as in temporal affairs, could not fail to encourage Catholic\r\nsovereigns to assert for themselves greater authority over the Church\r\nin their own territories, in utter disregard of the rights of the Pope\r\nand of the constitution of the Church. Frequently during the reigns of\r\nLeopold I. (1657-1705), of Joseph I. (1705-11), and of Charles VI.\r\n(1711-40) the interference of the civil power in ecclesiastical\r\naffairs had given just cause for complaint. But it was only during the\r\nreign of Francis I. (1745-65), and more especially of Joseph II.\r\n(1765-90), that the full results of the Jansenist, Gallican, and\r\nLiberal Catholic teaching made themselves felt in the empire as a\r\nwhole, and in the various states of which the empire was composed.\r\n\r\nThe most learned exponent of Gallican views on the German side of the\r\nRhine was John Nicholas von Hontheim (1701-90), who was himself a\r\nstudent of Van Espen (1646-1728), the well-known Gallican and\r\nJansenist professor of canon law in the University of Louvain. On the\r\nreturn of von Hontheim to his native city of Trier he was entrusted\r\nwith various important offices by the Prince-bishop of Trier, by whose\r\nadvice he was appointed assistant-bishop of that See (1740). He was a\r\nman of great ability, well versed especially in ecclesiastical and\r\nlocal history, and a close student of the writings of the Gallicans\r\n(Richer, Dupin, Thomassin, and Van Espen). At the time the hope of a\r\nreunion between the Lutherans and the Catholics in Germany was not\r\nabandoned completely. It seemed to von Hontheim that by lessening the\r\npower of the Papacy, which was regarded by the Protestants as the\r\ngreatest obstacle to reconciliation, Gallicanism provided the basis\r\nfor a good reunion programme, that was likely to be acceptable to\r\nmoderate men of both parties in Germany. With the object therefore of\r\npromoting the cause of reunion he set himself to compose his\r\nremarkable book, /De Statu Ecclesiae et de Legitima Potestate Romani\r\nPontificis/, published in 1762 under the assumed name of Justinus\r\nFebronius.\r\n\r\nAccording to Febronius Christ entrusted the power of the keys not to\r\nthe Pope nor to the hierarchy, but to the whole body of the faithful,\r\nwho in turn handed over the duty of administration to the Pope and the\r\nhierarchy. All bishops according to him were equal, and all were\r\nindependent of the government of their own dioceses, though at the\r\nsame time, for the purpose of preserving unity, a primacy of honour\r\nshould be accorded to the successor of Saint Peter. But this primacy\r\nwas not necessarily the special prerogative of the Roman See; it could\r\nbe separated from that Church and transferred to another diocese. In\r\nthe early ages of Christianity the Roman bishops never claimed the\r\npower wielded by their successors in later times. These pretensions to\r\nsupreme jurisdiction were founded upon the false decretals of Isidore\r\nand other forgeries, and constituted a corruption that should not be\r\ntolerated any longer in the Church. In reality the Pope was only the\r\nfirst among equals, empowered no doubt to carry on the administration\r\nof the Church, but incapable of making laws or irreformable decrees on\r\nfaith or morals. He was subject to a General Council which alone\r\nenjoyed the prerogative of infallibility. Febronius called upon the\r\nPope to abandon his untenable demands, and to be content with the\r\nposition held by his predecessors in the early centuries. If he\r\nrefused to do so spontaneously he should be forced to give up his\r\nusurpations, and if necessary the bishops should call upon the civil\r\nrulers to assist them in their struggle. As a means of restoring the\r\nPapacy to its rightful position, Febronius recommended the convocation\r\nof national synods and of a General Council, the proper instruction of\r\npriests and people, the judicious use of the Royal /Placet/ on papal\r\nannouncements, the enforcement of the /Appelatio ab Abusu/ against\r\npapal and episcopal aggression, and, as a last resort, the refusal of\r\nobedience.\r\n\r\nThe book was in such complete accord with the absolutist tendencies of\r\nthe age that it was received with applause by the civil rulers, and by\r\nthe court canonists, theologians, and lawyers, who saw in it the\r\nrealisation of their own dreams of a state Church subservient to the\r\ncivil ruler. The book was, however, condemned by Clement XIII. (1764),\r\nwho exhorted the German bishops to take vigorous measures against such\r\ndangerous theories. Many of the bishops were indifferent; others of\r\nthem were favourable to von Hontheim's views; but the majority\r\nsuppressed the book in their dioceses. Several treatises were\r\npublished in reply to Febronius, the most notable of which were those\r\nform the pen of Ballerini and Zaccaria. New editions of the work of\r\nFebronius were called for, and translations of the whole or part of it\r\nappeared in German, Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. It was\r\nreceived with great favour in Austria, where the principles of\r\nFebronius were adopted by most of the leading court canonists. At a\r\nmeeting held in Coblenz (1769) the three Prince-bishops of Mainz,\r\nTrier, and Cologne presented a catalogue of complaints (/Gravamina/)\r\nagainst the Roman Curia, many of which were extracted from or based\r\nupon the work of Hontheim. After repeated appeals of the Pope to the\r\nPrince-bishop of Trier to exercise his influence upon von Hontheim,\r\nthe latter consented to make a retractation in 1778, but his followers\r\nalleged that the retractation having been secured by threats was\r\nvalueless. This contention was supported by a commentary published by\r\nHontheim in explanation of his retractation, in which he showed\r\nclearly enough that he had not receded an inch from his original\r\nposition. Before his death in 1790 he expressed regret for the\r\ndoctrine he put forward, and died in full communion with the Church.\r\n\r\nThe teaching of Febronius, paving the way as it did for the supremacy\r\nof the State in religious matters, was welcomed by the Emperor Joseph\r\nII., by the Elector of Bavaria, as well as by the spiritual princes of\r\nthe Rhine provinces. In Austria, especially, violent measures were\r\ntaken to assert the royal supremacy. Joseph II. was influenced largely\r\nby the Gallican and liberal tendencies of his early teachers and\r\nadvisers. He dreamed of making Austria a rich, powerful, and united\r\nkingdom, and becoming himself its supreme and absolute ruler. During\r\nthe reign of his mother, Maria Theresa, he was kept in check, but\r\nafter her death in 1780, in conjunction with his prime minister,\r\nKaunitz, he began to inaugurate his schemes of ecclesiastical reform.\r\nHe insisted upon the Royal /Placet/ on all documents issued by the\r\nPope or by the bishops, forbade the bishops of his territories to hold\r\nany direct communication with Rome or to ask for a renewal of their\r\nfaculties, which faculties he undertook to confer by his own\r\nauthority. He forbade all his subjects to seek or accept honours from\r\nthe Pope, insisted upon the bishops taking the oath of allegiance to\r\nhimself before their consecration, introduced a system of state-\r\ncontrolled education, and suppressed a number of religious houses. In\r\norder that the clergy might be instructed in the proper ecclesiastical\r\nprinciples, he abolished the episcopal seminaries, and established\r\ncentral seminaries at Vienna, Pest, Louvain, Freiburg, and Pavia for\r\nthe education of the clergy in his dominions. Clerical students from\r\nAustria were forbidden to frequent the /Collegium Germanicum/ at Rome\r\nlest they should be brought under the influence of ultramontane\r\nteaching. Even the smallest details of ecclesiastical worship were\r\ndetermined by royal decrees. In all these reforms Joseph II. was but\r\nreducing to practice the teaching of Febronius.\r\n\r\nBy personal letters and by communications through his nuncio Pius VI.\r\nsought to induce Joseph II. to abstain from such a policy of state\r\naggression; but, as all his representations were ineffective, he\r\ndetermined to undertake a journey to Vienna, in the hope that his\r\npresence might bring about a change in the policy of the Emperor, or\r\nat least stir up the bishops to defend the interests of the Church\r\n(1782). He arrived at Vienna, had frequent interviews with the Emperor\r\nand with his minister Kaunitz, and was obliged to leave without any\r\nother result, except that he had assured himself of the fact that,\r\nwhatever about the Emperor or the bishops, the majority of the people\r\nof Austria were still loyal to the head of the Catholic Church. The\r\nfollowing year (1783) Joseph II. paid a return visit to Rome, when he\r\nwas induced by the representations of the Spanish ambassador to desist\r\nfrom his plan of a complete severance of Austria from the Holy See.\r\n\r\nJoseph II. had, however, proceeded too quickly and too violently in\r\nhis measures of reform. The people and the large body of the clergy\r\nwere opposed to him as were also the Cardinal-Archbishop of Vienna,\r\nthe bishops of Hungary, and the bishops of Belgium under the\r\nleadership of Cardinal Frankenberg. The state of affairs in the\r\nAustrian Netherlands became so threatening that the people rose in\r\nrevolt (1789), and Joseph II. found himself obliged to turn to the\r\nPope whom he had so maltreated and despised, in the hope that he might\r\ninduce the Belgian Catholics to return to their allegiance. He\r\npromised to withdraw most of the reforms that he had introduced, but\r\nhis repentance came too late to save the Austrian rule in the\r\nNetherlands. He died in 1790 with the full consciousness of the\r\nfailure of all his schemes.\r\n\r\nWhile Joseph II. was reducing Febronianism to practice in the Austrian\r\nterritories, the Prince-bishops of Mainz, Trier, and Cologne hastened\r\nto show their anxiety for the suppression of ultramontanism in the\r\nRhinelands. The list of grievances against Rome presented to the\r\nEmperor in 1769 indicated clearly their attachment to Gallican\r\nprinciples, and this feeling was not likely to be weakened by the\r\nerection of an apostolic nunciature at Munich in 1785. This step was\r\ntaken by the Pope at the request of Carl Theodore, Elector of Bavaria,\r\na great part of whose territory was under the spiritual rule of the\r\nprince-bishops. The prince-bishops of the west, together with the\r\nPrince-bishop of Salzburg, all of whom were hostile already to the\r\npapal nuncio, were greatly incensed by what they considered this new\r\nderogation of their rights, and sent representatives to a congress\r\nconvoked to meet at Ems (1786). The result of the congress was the\r\ncelebrated document known as the /Punctuation of Ems/, in which they\r\ndeclared that most of the prerogatives claimed by the Pope were\r\nunknown in the early centuries, and were based entirely on the false\r\ndecretals. They insisted that there should be no longer appeals to\r\nRome, that papal ordinances should be binding in any diocese only\r\nafter they had been accepted by the bishop of the diocese, that the\r\noath of allegiance taken by all bishops before consecration should be\r\nchanged, that no quinquennial faculties should be sought as bishops\r\nalready had such faculties by virtue of their office, and that\r\nreligious orders should not be exempt from the authority of the\r\nordinaries, nor be placed under the jurisdiction of foreign superiors.\r\nThe /Punctuation of Ems/ reduced the primacy of the Pope to a mere\r\nprimacy of honour, and had it been acted upon, it must have led\r\ninevitably to national schism.\r\n\r\nThe bishops forwarded a document to Joseph II., who, while approving\r\nof it, refused to interfere. The Elector of Bavaria opposed the action\r\nof the bishops as did also Pacca[1] (1756-1854), the papal nuncio at\r\nCologne. The latter issued a circular to the clergy warning them that\r\nthe dispensations granted by the prince-bishops without reference to\r\nRome were worthless. This circular gave great annoyance to the prince-\r\nbishops, particularly as they found themselves deserted by most of\r\nthose on whose support they had relied. Even the Protestant ruler\r\nFrederick II. of Prussia took the part of Rome against the\r\narchbishops. In face of the unfriendly attitude of the bishops and\r\nclergy nothing remained for the prince-bishops but to withdraw from an\r\nuntenable position. The Archbishop of Cologne for reasons of his own\r\nmade his submission, and asked for a renewal of his quinquennial\r\nfaculties (1787). The Archbishop of Trier made a similar application,\r\nnot indeed as Archbishop of Trier, but as Bishop of Augsburg. But\r\ntheir submission was meant only to gain time. They sought to have the\r\nmatter brought before the Diet at Regensburg in 1788, but the action\r\nof the Elector of Bavaria produced an unfavourable verdict. Having\r\nfailed in their design, they addressed a letter to the Pope asking him\r\nto put an end to the disedifying quarrel by withdrawing the papal\r\nnuncio from Cologne, and by sending a representative to the Diet to\r\narrange the terms of peace. The reply of Pius VI., covering as it did\r\nthe whole ground of the controversy, contained a masterly defence of\r\nthe papal rights and prerogatives (1789). The Archbishop of Trier\r\npublicly withdrew his adhesion to the /Punctuation/, and advised his\r\nGallican colleagues to do likewise, but they refused, and in the\r\nelection agreement of 1790 and 1792 they sought to pledge the emperors\r\nto support their policy. At last the Archbishops of Cologne and\r\nSalzburg made their submission, but the Archbishop of Mainz clung\r\nobstinately to his views, until the storm of the French Revolution\r\nbroke over his city and territory, and put an end to his rule as a\r\ntemporal prince.\r\n\r\nIn Tuscany where Leopold, brother of Joseph II., reigned (1765-90), a\r\ndetermined attempt was made to introduce Febronian principles as\r\nunderstood and applied in Austrian territory. Leopold was supported\r\nstrongly in this attempt by Scipio Ricci, who, though a Jansenist at\r\nheart, had been appointed to the Bishopric of Pistoia at the request\r\nof the Grand-Duke. The Bishop of Pistoia set himself deliberately to\r\nintroduce Jansenism and Gallicanism amongst his clergy. For this\r\npurpose he established a seminary at Pistoia, and placed it in the\r\nhands of teachers upon whom he could rely for the carrying out of his\r\ndesigns. In 1786 the Grand-Duke called a meeting of the bishops of the\r\nprovince, and explained to them in detail his programme of\r\necclesiastical reforms. With the exception of the Bishop of Pistoia\r\nand two others they refused to co-operate with him and his designs.\r\nThis plan having failed recourse was had to other measures. A synod\r\nwas summoned at Pistoia, which was presided over by Scipio Ricci, and\r\nguided in its deliberations by Tamburini the well-known Gallican\r\nprofessor of Pavia (1786). It was attended by over two hundred\r\npriests, some of whom belonged to the diocese, while others were total\r\nstrangers. As might be expected the decrees of the synod were strongly\r\nGallican and Jansenist. To ensure their introduction into the province\r\nof Tuscany a provincial synod of the bishops was called, but the\r\nbishops expressed their strong disapproval, and the people attacked\r\nthe palace of the bishop. He was obliged to retire from his diocese,\r\nthough at the same time he remained the active adviser of Leopold\r\nuntil the death of Joseph II. led to Leopold's election to the\r\nimperial throne (1790), and put an end to the disturbances in Tuscany.\r\nPius VI. appointed a commission to study the decrees of Pistoia, and\r\nin 1794 he issued the Bull, /Auctorem Fidei/, in which the principal\r\nerrors were condemned. The unfortunate bishop refused for years to\r\nmake his submission. It was only in 1805, on the return journey of\r\nPius VII. from the coronation of Napoleon at Paris, that he could be\r\ninduced to make his peace with the Church.[2]\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] Pacca, /Memorie storiche della nunziatura di Colonia/.\r\n\r\n[2] Scaduto, /Stato e chiesa sotto Leopoldo I., granduca di Toscana/,\r\n    1885.

They contended that Clement IX., regardless of\r\nthe action of his predecessors, had accepted the Jansenist principle\r\nof respectful silence. Several who had signed the formulary of\r\nAlexander VII. withdrew their signatures, and amongst the bishops,\r\nclergy, university graduates, and religious orders, particularly\r\namongst the Oratorians and Benedictines of St. Maur, the Jansenists\r\ngained many adherents. Though outwardly peace reigned in France, yet\r\nthe Jansenist spirit made great headway, as was shown by the\r\nopposition to several popular devotions and in the spread of rigorist\r\nopinions and practices in regard to confession and communion. The\r\ncontroversy on the Gallican Liberties complicated the issue very\r\nconsiderably, and made it impossible for the Pope to exercise his\r\nauthority. Even bishops like Bossuet, who were strongly opposed to\r\nJansenism, were inclined to regard papal interference with suspicion,\r\nwhile Louis XIV. was precluded from enforcing the decrees of the Pope\r\nas his predecessors had enforced them. The Jansenist party became much\r\nstronger, and only a slight incident was required to precipitate a new\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\nThis incident was supplied by the publication of the /Reflexions\r\nMorales sur le Nouveau Testament/ by Pasquier Quesnel (1634-1719). The\r\nwriter had been an Oratorian, but having been expelled from that\r\nsociety in 1684 he took refuge with Antoine Arnauld in Brussels. Upon\r\nthe death of the latter in 1694, he became the recognised head or\r\ngrand-prior of the Jansenist party. An earlier edition of this work\r\nhad been published, bearing the approbation of Vialart, Bishop of\r\nChalons, and though several additions had been made, this approbation\r\nwas printed on the new edition side by side with the approbation of\r\nLouis Noailles, then Bishop of Chalons (1695). The following year\r\nNoailles having become Archbishop of Paris felt called upon by his new\r\nposition to condemn a work closely akin in its ideas to those\r\nexpressed in the /Reflexions Morales/. He was accused of inconsistency\r\nby the Jansenist party, one of whom published the /Probleme\r\necclesiastique/, inquiring whether people were bound to follow the\r\nopinions of Louis Noailles, Bishop of Chalons in 1695, or of Louis\r\nNoailles, Archbishop of Paris in 1696? The controversy suddenly grew\r\nembittered. When a new edition was required in 1699, Noailles\r\nrequested the judgment of Bossuet, who formulated certain changes that\r\nin his opinion should be made.[1] In the end the edition was published\r\nwithout the suggested changes and without the approbation of the\r\narchbishop.\r\n\r\nWhile the controversy was raging round Quesnel's book, another\r\nincident occurred that tended to arouse all the old partisan feeling.\r\nA confessor submitted to the judgment of the Sorbonne the celebrated\r\ncase of conscience. He asked whether a priest should absolve a\r\npenitent, who rejected the teaching set forth in the five propositions\r\nof Jansenius, but who maintained a respectful silence on the question\r\nwhether or not they were to be found in the book /Augustinus/. In July\r\n1701 forty doctors of the Sorbonne gave an affirmative reply to this\r\nquestion. The publication of this reply created such a storm in France\r\nthat Clement XI. felt it necessary to condemn the decision of the\r\nSorbonne (1703). The papal condemnation was supported by Louis XIV.,\r\nas well as by the great body of the bishops. Two years later Clement\r\nXI. issued the bull /Vineam Domini/,[2] confirming the constitutions\r\nof his predecessors, Innocent X. and Alexander VII., and condemned\r\nonce more in an authoritative form the doctrine of respectful silence.\r\nThe document was accepted by the king, by the Assembly of the Clergy,\r\nand by the majority of the bishops, though the attachment of some of\r\nthe latter to Gallican principles led them to insist on certain\r\nconditions which the Pope could not accept. As the nuns of Port Royal\r\nstill refused to submit, their community was broken up, the sisters\r\nbeing scattered through different convents in France (1709), and the\r\nfollowing year the convent buildings were completely destroyed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the controversy regarding the /Reflexions Morales/ grew more\r\nbitter. Several of the bishops condemned the book as containing much\r\nin common with the writings of Jansenius and of his followers in\r\nFrance. Acting upon the demand of some of the bishops Clement XI.\r\nissued a brief condemning Quesnel's book (1708). The Jansenists\r\nrefused to accept the papal decision and the Parliament of Paris, then\r\ndominated to a great extent by Jansenist influence, adopted a hostile\r\nattitude. Cardinal Noailles, considering the verdict of the Pope as\r\nmore or less a personal insult to himself, hesitated as to what course\r\nhe should take, but at last he consented to accept the condemnation\r\nprovided the Pope issued a formal sentence. On the application of\r\nLouis XIV. the Pope determined to put an end to all possibility of\r\ndoubt or misunderstanding by publishing the Bull, /Unigenitus/[3]\r\n(1713) in which 101 propositions taken from Quesnel's book were\r\ncondemned. As is usual in such documents the propositions were\r\ncondemned /in globo/, some as rash, some as offensive to pious ears,\r\nand some as heretical. The Bull, /Unigenitus/, was accepted\r\nimmediately by one hundred and twelve bishops of France, by the\r\nmajority of the clergy, by the Sorbonne, and by the king and\r\nParliament. The Jansenists refused to admit that it contained a final\r\nverdict on the ground that, as it did not make clear which\r\npropositions were heretical and which only rash or offensive, it was\r\nonly a disciplinary enactment and not a binding doctrinal decision.\r\nCardinal Noailles wavered for a time, but in the end he allied himself\r\nwith the fourteen bishops who refused to accept the Bull /Unigenitus/.\r\nLouis XIV., though opposed strongly to the Jansenists, was unwilling\r\nto allow the Pope to take serious action against the Archbishop of\r\nParis lest the liberties of the Gallican Church should be endangered,\r\nwhile the Parliament of Paris sympathised openly with those who\r\nrefused to accept the papal decision.\r\n\r\nThe death of Louis XIV. (1714) and the accession of the Duke of\r\nOrleans as regent led to a great reaction in favour of Jansenism.\r\nCardinal Noailles was honoured by a seat in the privy council, and\r\nbecame the principal adviser of the regent in ecclesiastical affairs.\r\nThe Sorbonne withdrew its submission to the Bull /Unigenitus/ (1715),\r\nand its example was followed by the Universities of Nantes and Rheims.\r\nMany of the Jansenist chapters and priests rebelled against their\r\nbishops, and were taken under the protection of the Parliament. The\r\nArchbishop of Paris was encouraged by addresses from his chapter and\r\nclergy to stand out firmly against the tyranny of Rome. More than once\r\nthe Pope remonstrated with the regent, who promised much but refused\r\nto take decisive action. The Sorbonne was punished by the Pope by the\r\nwithdrawal of its power to confer theological decrees (1716), while\r\nmany of the bishops refused to allow their students to attend its\r\ncourses. As a last desperate expedient four of the bishops of France\r\nappealed solemnly to a General Council against the Bull /Unigenitus/\r\n(1717), and their example was followed by large numbers. The\r\n/Appellants/ as they were called created such a disturbance in France\r\nthat they appeared to be much more numerous than they really were.\r\nLess than twenty of the bishops and not more than three thousand\r\nclerics, seven hundred of whom belonged to Paris, joined the party,\r\nwhile more than one hundred bishops and one hundred thousand clerics\r\nremained loyal to Rome. The fact, however, that Cardinal Noailles,\r\nArchbishop of Paris, placed himself at the head of the /Appellants/\r\nmade the situation decidedly serious.\r\n\r\nWhen private protests and remonstrances had failed Clement XI. issued\r\nthe Bull, /Pastoralis Officii/, by which he excommunicated the\r\n/Appellants/ (1718). Undaunted by this verdict a new appeal in solemn\r\nform was lodged by Cardinal Noailles, backed by his chapter and by a\r\nlarge number of the Paris clergy. Negotiations were opened up with\r\nInnocent XIII. and Benedict XIII. in the hope of inducing them to\r\nwithdraw the Bull /Unigenitus/, or at least to give it a milder\r\ninterpretation, but the Popes refused to change the decisions that had\r\nbeen given by their predecessors. The Parliament of Paris espoused the\r\ncause of the /Appellants/, and refused to allow the bishops to take\r\nenergetic action against them, until at last the king grew alarmed at\r\nthe danger that threatened France. The energetic action taken by the\r\nprovincial council of Embrun against some of the /Appellant/ bishops\r\n(1727) received the approval of the court. In the following year\r\n(1728) Cardinal Noailles was induced to make his submission, and in a\r\nshort time the Sorbonne doctors by a majority imitated his example.\r\nThough these submissions were not without good results, yet they\r\nserved only to embitter still more the minds of a large body of the\r\nJansenist party, and to strengthen them in their opposition to the\r\nBull, /Unigenitus/.\r\n\r\nThe Jansenists having failed to secure the approval of Pope or king\r\nfor their heretical teaching appealed to the visible judgment of God.\r\nThe deacon, Francis of Paris,[4] who was one of the leaders of the\r\nsect, and whose sanctity was vouched for, according to his friends, by\r\nthe fact that he had abstained from receiving Holy Communion for two\r\nyears, died in 1727, and was buried in the cemetery of Saint Medard.\r\nCrowds flocked to pray at his tomb, and it was alleged that wonderful\r\ncures were being wrought by his intercession. One of the earliest and\r\nmost striking of these miracles was investigated by the Archbishop of\r\nParis and was proved to be without foundation, but others still more\r\nremarkable were broadcast by the party, with the result that hosts of\r\ninvalids were brought from all parts of France in the hope of\r\nprocuring recovery. Many, especially women, went into ecstasies and\r\nviolent convulsions round the tomb, and while in this state they\r\ndenounced the Pope, the bishops, and in a word all the adversaries of\r\nJansenism. Owing to the unseemly and at times indecent scenes that\r\ntook place the cemetery was closed by the civil authorities (1732),\r\nbut the /Convulsionnaires/, as they were called, claimed that similar\r\nmiracles were wrought in private houses, in which they assembled to\r\npray, and to which clay taken from the tomb of the Deacon of Paris had\r\nbeen brought. The great body of the people ridiculed the extravagances\r\nof the sect, and many of the moderate Jansenists condemned the\r\n/Convulsionnaires/ in unsparing terms. Instead of doing Jansenism any\r\ngood these so-called miracles, utterly unworthy as they were of divine\r\nwisdom and holiness, served only to injure its cause, and indeed to\r\ninjure the Christian religion generally, by placing a good weapon in\r\nthe hands of its rationalist adversaries.\r\n\r\nBut even though heaven had not declared in favour of the Jansenists\r\nthe Parliament of Paris determined to protect them. It defended\r\nbishops who refused to accept the Bull /Unigenitus/ against the Pope,\r\ntried to prevent the orthodox bishops from suspending appellant\r\npriests, and forbade the exclusion of appellant laymen from the\r\nsacraments. The Parliament of Paris condemned the action of the clergy\r\nin refusing the last sacraments to the dying unless they could prove\r\nthey had made their confession to an approved priest. Though the privy\r\ncouncil annulled this condemnation Parliament stood by its decision,\r\nand challenged the authority of the Archbishop of Paris by punishing\r\npriests who refused the sacraments (1749-52). The bishops appealed to\r\nthe king to defend the liberty of the Church, but the Parliament\r\nasserted its jurisdiction by depriving the Archbishop of Paris of his\r\ntemporalities and by endeavouring to have him cited before the civil\r\ncourts. Louis XIV. annulled the sentence of the Parliament, and\r\nbanished some of the more violent of its members from the capital\r\n(1753). They were, however, soon recalled, and a royal mandate was\r\nissued enforcing silence on both parties. For infringing this order de\r\nBeaumont, Archbishop of Paris, was banished from his See, and several\r\nother bishops and priests were summoned before the legal tribunals.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly of the Clergy in 1755 petitioned the king to give more\r\nfreedom to the Church, and to restore the exiled Archbishop of Paris\r\nto his See. A commission was established to examine the whole question\r\nof the refusal of the sacraments, and as the Commission could not\r\narrive at any decision, the case was submitted to Benedict XIV., who\r\ndecided that those who were public and notorious opponents of the\r\nBull, /Unigenitus/, should be treated as public sinners and should be\r\nexcluded from the sacraments (1756). The Parliament of Paris and some\r\nof the provincial parliaments forbade the publication of the papal\r\ndecision, but a royal order was issued commanding the universal\r\nacceptance of the Bull, /Unigenitus/, even though it might not be\r\nregarded as an irreformable rule of faith. According to this mandate\r\nthe regulation for allowing or refusing the administrations of the\r\nsacraments was a matter to be determined by the bishops, though any\r\nperson who considered himself aggrieved by their action might appeal\r\nagainst the abuse of ecclesiastical power. This decree was registered\r\nby the Parliament (1757), whereupon the Archbishop of Paris was\r\nallowed to return. From that time Jansenism declined rapidly in\r\nFrance, but the followers of the sect united with the Gallicans of the\r\nParliament to enslave the Church, and with the Rationalists to procure\r\nthe suppression of the Jesuits, whom they regarded as their most\r\npowerful opponents.\r\n\r\nMany of the Jansenists fled to Holland, where the Gallicans were only\r\ntoo willing to welcome such rebels against Rome. The old Catholic\r\nhierarchy in Holland had been overthrown, and the Pope was obliged to\r\nappoint vicars apostolic to attend to the wants of the scattered\r\nCatholic communities. One of these appointed in 1688 was an Oratorian,\r\nand as such very partial to Quesnel and the Jansenists. Owing to his\r\npublic alliance with the sect he was suspended from office in 1702 and\r\ndeposed in 1704, but not before he had given Jansenism a great impetus\r\nin Holland. About seventy parishes and about eighty priests refused to\r\nrecognise his successor, and went over to the Jansenist party. In 1723\r\na body of priests calling themselves the Chapter of Utrecht elected\r\nSteenhoven as Archbishop of Utrecht, and a suspended bishop named\r\nVarlet, belonging formerly to the Society for Foreign Missions,\r\nconsecrated him against the protests of the Pope. Supported by the\r\nCalvinist government the new archbishop maintained himself at Utrecht\r\ntill his death, when he was succeeded by others holding similar views.\r\nLater on the Bishoprics of Haarlem (1742) and of Deventer were\r\nestablished as suffragan Sees to Utrecht. The Catholics of Holland\r\nrefused to recognise these bishoprics as did also the Pope, whose only\r\nreply to their overtures was a sentence of excommunication and\r\ninterdict. The Jansenist body of Holland, numbering at present about\r\nsix thousand, have maintained their separate ecclesiastical\r\norganisation until the present day. They resisted the establishment of\r\nthe hierarchy in Holland (1853), opposed the definition of Papal\r\nInfallibility, and allied themselves definitely with the old Catholic\r\nmovement in Germany.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] Ingold, /Bossuet et la jansenisme/, 1904.\r\n\r\n[2] Denzinger, 11th edition, n. 1350.\r\n\r\n[3] Denzinger, op. cit., nos. 1351-1451.\r\n\r\n[4] Matthieu, /Histoire des miracles et des convulsionnaires de St.\r\n    Medard/, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            (d) Quietism.\r\n\r\n  Molinos, /Guida spirituale/, 1681. /Oeuvres spirituelles de Madame\r\n  Guyon/, 42 vols., 1713.

In\r\nthe Middle Ages, while many of the ablest exponents of Scholasticism\r\nwere also distinguished mystics, yet more than once Mysticism or the\r\ntheology of the heart, unrestrained by the guiding influence of the\r\ntheology of the intellect, fell into grievous errors akin to the\r\nPantheism of the Buddhists and the Stoics. Many of these Middle Age\r\nmystics maintained that perfection consisted in the union of the soul\r\nwith God by quiet contemplation, so that those who reached that state\r\nhad no need of external aids to sanctity, such as good works, the\r\nsacraments, or prayer; that they were under no obligation to obey any\r\nlaw, ecclesiastical or divine, since their will was united to God's\r\nwill; and that they need make no effort to resist carnal thoughts or\r\ndesires, as these came from the devil and could not possibly stain the\r\nsoul. Such, however, was not the teaching of the great Spanish\r\nauthorities on mystical theology, Saint Teresa, Saint John of the\r\nCross, and Louis of Granada, whose works on spiritual perfection and\r\non the ways that lead to it have never been surpassed. But side by\r\nside with this school of thought, another and less orthodox form of\r\nmysticism manifested itself in Spain. Many of the sectaries, such as\r\nthe Alumbrados or Illuminati, carried away by pantheistic principles,\r\nfell into error, and put forward under the guise of mystical theology\r\nnot a few of the extravagances that had been condemned by the Council\r\nof Vienne (1311) and by the judgment of the universal Church.\r\n\r\nClosely akin to the errors of this Spanish school was the doctrine\r\nknown as Quietism taught by Michael de Molinos (1640-96), a Spanish\r\npriest, who having completed his studies at Valencia took up his\r\nresidence in Rome. He published a work entitled /Guida Spirituale/ in\r\n1675, the ascetical principles of which attracted so much attention\r\nthat translations of the book appeared almost immediately in nearly\r\nevery country of Europe. The teaching of Molinos was denounced to the\r\nInquisition by the Jesuits and the Dominicans, and in 1687 Innocent\r\nXI. issued the Bull /Coelestis Pastor/,[1] in which he condemned\r\nsixty-eight propositions put forward by Molinos. The author having\r\nbeen arrested was obliged to make a public recantation, and remained a\r\nprisoner until his death (1696).\r\n\r\nAccording to Molinos perfection consists in a state of self-\r\nannihilation in which the soul remains entirely passive, absorbed\r\ncompletely in the contemplation and love of God. By means of this\r\npassivity or complete surrender of the human faculties to God the soul\r\nof man is transformed, and is in a sense deified. While in this\r\ncondition there is no need to act or to desire to act, to think of\r\nrewards or punishments, of defects or virtues, of sanctification,\r\npenance, or good works, nor is there any necessity to resist carnal\r\nthoughts or motions since these are the works of the devil. Such a\r\nsystem, founded nominally on the pure love of God, and leading of\r\nnecessity to the overthrow of law, morality, and religious authority,\r\nfound great favour in Italy and Spain, where it required all the\r\nenergies and powers of the Inquisition to secure its suppression. It\r\nwas backed by the Oratorian, Petrucci, afterwards created a cardinal\r\n(1686), whose books on the spiritual life were attacked by the Jesuit,\r\nPaul Segneri, and condemned by the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nQuietism found favour in France through the writings and teachings of\r\nFrancis Malaval of Marseilles and of the Barnabite Pere Lacombe. The\r\nindividual whose name is most closely identified with Quietism in\r\nFrance is, however, Madame Jeanne de la Mothe Guyon, a young widow who\r\non the death of her husband gave herself up to the practice of prayer\r\nand to the study of the principles of the spiritual life. Admitting as\r\nshe did the fundamental doctrine of the system of Molinos, namely,\r\nthat perfection consists in a state of self-abnegation in which the\r\nsoul is wrapped up completely in pure love of God, she rejected most\r\nof the absurd and immoral conclusions that seemed to follow from it.\r\nAccording to her, and more especially according to her principal\r\ndefender, Fenelon, pure love of God without any thought of self-\r\ninterest or of reward or punishment, constitutes the essence of the\r\nspiritual life, and must be the principle and motive of all deliberate\r\nand meritorious acts. This teaching constitutes what is known as Semi-\r\nQuietism. Madame Guyon published several works and gave many\r\nconferences in various cities of France. The close connexion between\r\nher teaching and the mysticism of Molinos attracted the unfriendly\r\nnotice of the French authorities, particularly as Louis XIV. was a\r\nstrong opponent of Quietism. As a result Madame Guyon and her\r\nspiritual director, Pere Lacombe, were arrested in Paris (1688), but\r\nowing to the interference of Madame de Maintenon, Madame Guyon was\r\nreleased.\r\n\r\nFenelon, then a priest and tutor to the Duke of Burgundy, grandson of\r\nLouis XIV. and prospective heir to the throne of France, was deeply\r\ninterested in the teaching of Madame Guyon whose acquaintance he had\r\nmade in Paris. Fenelon, while rejecting the false mysticism of de\r\nMolinos, agreed with Madame Guyon in believing that the state of\r\nperfection in this life is that in which all righteous acts proceed\r\nfrom pure love without any hope of reward or fear of punishment, and\r\nthat all virtuous acts to be meritorious must proceed directly or\r\nindirectly from charity. This teaching found a strenuous opponent in\r\nBossuet, Bishop of Meaux. A commission consisting of Bossuet, de\r\nNoailles, then Bishop of Chalons, and Tronson, superior of the\r\nSulpicians, was appointed to examine the whole question (1695). A\r\nlittle later Fenelon, who had just been promoted to the Archbishopric\r\nof Cambrai, was added to the list. The conference met in the Sulpician\r\nseminary at Issy, and as a result thirty-four articles were drawn up,\r\nall of which were accepted by Madame Guyon and Pere Lacombe. The\r\nformer having returned to Paris was arrested, and forced to sign\r\nanother recantation of her theories and to promise that she would\r\nnever again attempt to spread them. From that time till her death in\r\n1717 she took no further part in the discussions.\r\n\r\nBut the controversy regarding Semi-Quietism was to be carried on\r\nbetween the two greatest churchmen and literary giants of their age,\r\nnamely, Bossuet, Bishop of Meaux, and Fenelon, Archbishop of Cambrai.\r\nBossuet, not content with the partial victory that he had secured at\r\nthe Issy conference, determined to expose the dangerous tendencies of\r\nMadame Guyon's teaching by a short statement of the Catholic doctrine\r\non perfection and the spiritual life. This he did in his book\r\n/Instructions sur les etats d'oraison/, which he submitted to Fenelon\r\nin the hope of obtaining his approval. This Fenelon refused to give,\r\npartly because he thought Madame Guyon had been punished severely\r\nenough and should not be attacked once she had made her submission,\r\nand partly also because he believed the views of Bossuet on charity\r\nand self-interest were unsound. Before Bossuet's book could be\r\npublished Fenelon anticipated him in a work entitled /Explication des\r\nmaximes des Saints sur la vie interieure/, in which he defended many\r\nof Madame Guyon's views. This book was submitted to the Archbishop of\r\nParis, to Tronson, and to some of the theologians of the Sorbonne,\r\nfrom all of whom it received the highest commendations.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Meaux, annoyed at the action of Fenelon, denounced the\r\nbook to Louis XIV., who appointed a commission to examine it (1697).\r\nFenelon, fearing that a commission, one of the members of which was\r\nhis rival Bossuet, would not be likely to give an impartial judgment,\r\nforwarded his book to Rome for judgment. While the Roman authorities\r\nwere at work a violent controversy was carried on between Fenelon and\r\nBossuet, which, however much it may have added to the literary\r\nreputation of the combatants, was neither edifying nor instructive. On\r\nthe side of Bossuet especially it is clear that personalities played a\r\nmuch greater part than zeal for orthodoxy. In Rome opinion was very\r\nmuch divided about the orthodoxy of Fenelon's work. Louis XIV. left no\r\nstone unturned to secure its condemnation. In the end Innocent XII.\r\ncondemned twenty propositions taken from the book (1699).[2] This\r\nsentence was handed to Fenelon just as he was about to mount the\r\npulpit in his own cathedral on the Feast of the Annunciation. After\r\nmastering its contents he preached on the submission that was due to\r\nsuperiors, read the condemnation for the people, and announced to them\r\nthat he submitted completely to the decision of the Pope, and besought\r\nhis friends earnestly neither to read his book nor to defend the views\r\nthat it contained.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] Denzinger, op. cit., nos. 1221-88.\r\n\r\n[2] In the Brief, /Cum alias/, Denzinger, op. cit., nos. 1327-49.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                     RATIONALISM AND ITS EFFECTS\r\n\r\n\r\n       (a) Anti-Christian Philosophy of the Eighteenth Century.\r\n\r\n  Lecky, /History of the Rise and Influence of Rationalism in\r\n  Europe/, 1913.

But\r\nsuch views were expounded in an age when the outlook of society was\r\nmarkedly religious, and they exercised no perceptible influence on\r\ncontemporary thought. Between the fourteenth century and the\r\neighteenth, however, a great change had taken place in the world.\r\nDogmatic theology had lost its hold upon many educated men. The\r\nRenaissance movement ushering in the first beginnings of literary and\r\nhistorical criticism, the wonderful progress made in the natural\r\nsciences, revolutionising as it did beliefs that had been regarded\r\nhitherto as unquestionable, and the influence of the printing press\r\nand of the universities, would in themselves have created a dangerous\r\ncrisis in the history of religious thought, and would have\r\nnecessitated a more careful study on the part of the theologians to\r\ndetermine precisely the limits where dogma ended and opinion began.\r\n\r\nBut the most important factor in arousing active opposition to or\r\nstudied contempt of revealed religion was undoubtedly the religious\r\nrevolution of the sixteenth century, and more especially the dangerous\r\nprinciples formulated by Luther and his companions to justify them in\r\ntheir resistance to doctrines and practices that had been accepted for\r\ncenturies by the whole Christian world. They were driven to reject the\r\nteaching authority of the visible Church, to maintain that Christ had\r\ngiven to men a body of doctrines that might be interpreted by His\r\nfollowers in future ages as they pleased, and to assert that\r\nChristians should follow the dictates of individual judgment instead\r\nof yielding a ready obedience to the decrees of Popes and Councils.\r\nThese were dangerous principles, the full consequence of which the\r\nearly Reformers did not perceive. If it was true, as they asserted,\r\nthat Christ had set up no visible authority to safeguard and to\r\nexpound His revelation, that for centuries Christianity had been\r\ncorrupted by additions that were only the inventions of men, it might\r\nwell be asked what guarantee could Luther or Calvin give that their\r\ninterpretation of Christ's doctrine was correct or binding upon their\r\nfollowers, and what authority could they produce to warrant them in\r\nplacing any dogmatic restrictions upon the freedom of human thought?\r\nThe very principles put forward by the Reformers of the sixteenth\r\ncentury to justify their rejection of certain doctrines were used by\r\nlater generations to prepare the way for still greater inroads upon\r\nthe contents of Christianity, and finally to justify an attitude of\r\ndoubt concerning the very foundations on which Christianity was based.\r\nEmpiricism, Sensualism, Materialism, and Scepticism in philosophy,\r\nundermined dogmatic Christianity, and prepared the way for the\r\nirreligious and indifferentist opinions, that found such general\r\nfavour among the educated and higher classes during the eighteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe movement, that owed so much of its widespread popularity on the\r\nContinent to the influence of the French rationalistic school, had its\r\norigin in England, where the frequent changes of religion during the\r\nreigns of Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth, the quarrels\r\nbetween the Puritans and the High Church party, and the spread of\r\nrevolutionary principles during the reign of Charles I., had\r\ncontributed not a little to unsettle the religious convictions of a\r\nlarge section of the community. Many individuals, influenced by\r\npantheistic teaching, did not believe in the existence of a personal\r\nGod distinct from the world; others, while holding fast to the belief\r\nin a personal supreme Being, rejected the Trinity and the Incarnation,\r\nand a still larger section insisted on the subjection of Christian\r\nrevelation to the judgment of reason, and as a consequence on the\r\nrejection of everything in Christianity that flavoured of the\r\nsupernatural. The works of these men were imported from the\r\nNetherlands into France in spite of all restrictions that could be\r\nimposed by the police authorities, and their views were popularised by\r\na brilliant band of /litterateurs/, until in a short time Deism and\r\nNaturalism became quite fashionable in the higher circles of French\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThe principal writers of the English school were Lord Herbert of\r\nCherbury (1581-1648), whose works tended to call in question the\r\nexistence of a supernatural religion; John Hobbs (1588-1679) the\r\napostle of absolute rule, who saw in religion only a means of keeping\r\nthe people in subjection; John Locke (1632-1704), nominally a\r\nChristian himself, whose philosophy of Empiricism and Sensualism\r\nbarred the way effectively against belief in a supernatural religion;\r\nCharles Blount (1630-93), who like Flavius Philostratus sought to\r\ndiscredit Christianity by setting up Apollonius of Tyana as a rival of\r\nChrist; Collins, the patron of free-thinkers (1676-1729); John Toland\r\n(1670-1722), who although originally a believer in Christian\r\nrevelation tended more and more towards Pantheism; and Tyndal (1656-\r\n1733), who changed from Protestantism to Catholicism and finally from\r\nChristianity to Rationalism. In England Deism and Naturalism secured a\r\nstrong foot-hold amongst the better classes, but the deeply religious\r\ntemperament of the English people and their strong conservatism saved\r\nthe nation from falling under the influence of such ideas.\r\n\r\nIn France the religious wars between the Catholics and Calvinists, the\r\ncontroversies that were waged by the Jansenists and Gallicans, the\r\nextravagances of the /Convulsionnaires/, the flagrant immorality of\r\nthe court during the rule of the Duke of Orleans and of Louis XV., and\r\nthe enslavement of the Church, leading as it did to a decline of zeal\r\nand learning amongst the higher clergy, tended inevitably to foster\r\nreligious indifference amongst the masses. In the higher circles of\r\nsociety Rationalism was looked upon as a sign of good breeding, while\r\nthose who held fast by their dogmatic beliefs were regarded as vulgar\r\nand unprogressive. Leading society ladies such as Ninon de Lenclos\r\n(1615-1706) gathered around them groups of learned admirers, who under\r\nthe guise of zeal for the triumph of literary and artistic ideals\r\nsought to popularise everything that was obscene and irreligious.\r\nAmongst some of the principal writers who contributed largely to the\r\nsuccess of the anti-Christian campaign in France might be mentioned\r\nPeter Bayle (1647-1706), whose /Dictionnaire historique et critique/\r\nbecame the leading source of information for those who were in search\r\nof arguments against Christianity; John Baptist Rousseau (1671-1741),\r\nwhose life was in complete harmony with the filthiness to which he\r\ngave expression in his works; Bernard le Boivier de Fontenelle (1657-\r\n1757), who though never an open enemy of the Catholic Church\r\ncontributed not a little by his works to prepare the way for the men\r\nof the Enclyclopaedia; Montesquieu (1689-1755), whose satirical books\r\non both Church and State were read with pleasure not only in France\r\nbut in nearly every country of Europe; D'Alembert (1717-83) and\r\nDiderot (1713-84), the two men mainly responsible for the\r\n/Encyclopedie/; Helvetius (1715-1771), and the Baron d'Holbach, who\r\nsought to popularise the irreligious views then current among the\r\nnobility by spreading the rationalist literature throughout the mass\r\nof the poorer classes in Paris.\r\n\r\nBut the two writers whose works did most to undermine revealed\r\nreligion in France were Francois Marie Arouet, better known as\r\nVoltaire (1694-1778), and Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778). The\r\nformer of these was born at Paris, received his early education from\r\nthe Jesuits, and was introduced while still a youth to the salon of\r\nNinon de Lenclos, frequented at this time by the principal literary\r\nopponents of religion and morality. His earliest excursions into\r\nliterature marked him out immediately as a dangerous adversary of the\r\nChristian religion. He journeyed in England where he was in close\r\ntouch with the Deist school of thought, in Germany where he was a\r\nwelcome guest at the court of Frederick II. of Prussia, and settled\r\nfinally at Ferney in Switzerland close to the French frontiers.\r\nTowards the end of his life (1778) he returned to Paris where he\r\nreceived a popular ovation. Poets, philosophers, actresses, and\r\nacademicians vied with one another in doing honour to a man who had\r\nvowed to crush /L'Infame/, as he termed Christianity, and whose\r\nwritings had done so much to accomplish that result in the land of his\r\nbirth. The reception given to Voltaire in Paris affords the most\r\nstriking proof of the religious and moral corruption of all classes in\r\nFrance at this period. Jean-Jacques Rousseau was born at Geneva and\r\nreared as a Calvinist. Later on he embraced the Catholic religion,\r\nfrom which he relapsed once more into Calvinism, if indeed in his\r\nlater years he was troubled by any dogmatic beliefs. His private life\r\nwas in perfect harmony with the moral tone of most of his works. He\r\nhad neither the wit nor the literary genius of Voltaire, but in many\r\nrespects his works, especially /Le Contrat Social/, exercised a\r\ngreater influence on the France of his own time and on Europe\r\ngenerally since that time than any other writings of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. His greatest works were /La Nouvelle Heloise/ (1759), a novel\r\ndepicting the most dangerous of human passions; /Emile/, a\r\nphilosophical romance dealing with educational ideas and tending\r\ndirectly towards Deism, and /Le Contrat Social/, in which he\r\nmaintained that all power comes from the people, and may be recalled\r\nif those to whom it has been entrusted abuse it. The /Confessions/\r\nwhich tell the story of his shameless life were not published until\r\nafter his death.\r\n\r\nTo further their propaganda without at the same time attracting the\r\nnotice of the civil authorities the rationalist party had recourse to\r\nvarious devices. Pamphlets and books were published, professedly\r\ndescriptive of manners and customs in foreign countries, but directed\r\nin reality against civil and religious institutions in France. Typical\r\nexamples of this class of literature were the /Persian Letters/ of\r\nMontesquieu, /A Description of the Island of Borneo/ by Fontanelle,\r\n/The Life of Mohammed/ by Henri de Bouillon Villiers, and a /Letter on\r\nthe English/ from the pen of Voltaire. The greatest and most\r\nsuccessful work undertaken by them for popularising their ideas was\r\nundoubtedly the /Encyclopedie/. The professed object of the work was\r\nto give in a concise and handy form the latest and best results of\r\nscholarship in every department of human knowledge, but the real aim\r\nof the founders was to spread their poisonous views amongst the people\r\nof France, and to win them from their allegiance to the Catholic\r\nChurch. In order to escape persecution from the government and to\r\nconceal their real purposes many of the articles were written by\r\nclerics and laymen whose orthodoxy was above suspicion, and many of\r\nthe articles referring to religion from the pen of the rationalistic\r\ncollaborateurs were respectful in tone, though a careful reader could\r\nsee that they did not represent the real views of the author.\r\nSometimes references were given to other articles of a very different\r\nkind, where probably opposite views were established by apparently\r\nsound arguments. The originator of the project was D'Alembert, who was\r\nassisted by Diderot, Voltaire, Montesquieu, Condillac, Buffon, and\r\nD'Holbach. The work was begun in 1750, and in spite of interruptions\r\nand temporary suppressions it was brought to a successful conclusion\r\nin 1772. The reviewers and the learned world hailed it with delight as\r\na veritable treasure-house of information. New and cheap editions of\r\nit were brought out for the general public, and in a remarkably short\r\ntime the influence of the Encyclopaedists had reached the lowest strata\r\nof French society. Many of those in authority in France favoured the\r\ndesigns of the Encyclopaedists, and threw all kinds of obstacles in the\r\nway of those who sought to uphold the teaching of the Church, but soon\r\nthey had reason to regret their approval of a campaign that led\r\ndirectly to revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n               (b) The Aufklarung Movement in Germany.\r\n\r\n  See bibliography (viii. a).

At\r\nbest these formularies were only the works of men who rejected the\r\nauthority of the Church, and as works of men they could not be\r\nregarded as irreformable. With the progress of knowledge and the\r\ndevelopment of human society it was thought that they required\r\nrevision to bring them more into harmony with the results of science\r\nand with the necessities of the age. The influence of the writings\r\nimported from England and France, backed as it was by the approval and\r\nexample of Frederick II. of Prussia, could not fail to weaken dogmatic\r\nChristianity among the Lutherans of Germany. The philosophic teaching\r\nof Leibniz (1646-1710), who was himself a strong upholder of dogmatic\r\nChristianity and zealous for a reunion of Christendom, had a great\r\neffect on the whole religious thought of Germany during the eighteenth\r\ncentury. In his great work, /Theodicee/, written against Bayle to\r\nprove that there was no conflict between the kingdoms of nature and\r\ngrace, greater stress was laid upon the natural than on the\r\nsupernatural elements in Christianity. His disciples, advancing beyond\r\nthe limits laid down by the master, prepared the way for the rise of\r\ntheological rationalism.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest of the disciples of Leibniz was Christian Wolf\r\n(1679-1754), who was not himself an opponent of supernatural religion.\r\nThe whole trend of his arguments, however, went to show that human\r\nreason was the sole judge of the truths of revelation, and that\r\nwhatever was not in harmony with the verdict of reason must be\r\neliminated. Many of his disciples like Remiarus, Mendelssohn, and\r\nGarve developed the principles laid down by Wolf until the very\r\nmention of dogma was scouted openly, and Theism itself was put forward\r\nas only the most likely among many possible hypotheses. In the\r\nrevulsion against dogmatic beliefs the party of the Pietists founded\r\nby Spener towards the end of the seventeenth century found much\r\nsupport, while the Conscientiarians, who maintained that man's own\r\nconscience was the sole rule of faith, and that so long as man acts in\r\naccordance with the dictates of conscience he is leading the life of\r\nthe just, gained ground rapidly. Some of its principal leaders were\r\nMatthew Knutzen and Christian Edlemann who rejected the authority of\r\nthe Bible. The spread of Rationalism was strengthened very much by the\r\nappearance of the /Allgemeine Deutsche Bibliothek/, founded in 1764 by\r\nNicolai in Berlin, through the agency of which books hostile to\r\nChristianity were scattered broadcast amongst a large circle of\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\nThese rationalistic principles, when applied to the Bible and the\r\ninterpretation of the Bible, helped to put an end to the very rigid\r\nviews regarding the inspiration of the sacred writings entertained by\r\nthe early Lutherans. Everything that was supernatural or miraculous\r\nmust be explained away. To do so without denying inspiration the\r\n\"Accommodation\" theory, namely that Christ and His apostles\r\naccommodated themselves to the mistaken views of their contemporaries,\r\nwas formulated by Semler (1725-1791). But more extreme men, as for\r\nexample, Lessing (1729-1781), who published the /Wolfenbuttler\r\nFragments/ written by Reimarus in which a violent onslaught was made\r\nupon the Biblical miracles more especially on the Resurrection of\r\nChrist, attacked directly the miracles of Christianity, and wrote\r\nstrongly in favour of religious indifference.\r\n\r\nThe rationalistic dogmatism of Wolf when brought face to face with the\r\nobjections of Hume did not satisfy Immanuel Kant (1720-1804), who in\r\nhis /Critique of Pure Reason/ (1781) denied that it was possible for\r\nscience or philosophy to reach a knowledge of the substance or essence\r\nof things as distinguished from the phenomena, and that consequently\r\nthe arguments used generally to prove the existence of God were\r\nworthless. In his own /Critique of Practical Reason/ (1788), however,\r\nhe endeavoured to build up what he had pulled down, by showing that\r\nthe moral law implanted in the heart of every human being necessarily\r\nimplied the existence of a supreme law-giver. For Kant religion was to\r\nbe identified with duty and not with dogmatic definitions. Such a line\r\nof defence, attempting as it did to remove religion from the arena of\r\nintellectual discussion, thereby evading most of the objections put\r\nforward by the rationalistic school, was a dangerous one. It led\r\ngradually to the rejection of external revelation, and to dogmatic\r\nindifference. Such a theory in the hands of Herder and above all of\r\nSchleiermacher (1768-1834) meant an end to Christian revelation as\r\ngenerally understood. For Schleiermacher religion was nothing more\r\nthan the consciousness of dependence upon God. Given this sense of\r\ndependence, variations in creeds were of no importance. Between the\r\nreligion of Luther and the religion of Schleiermacher there was an\r\nimmense difference, but nevertheless it was Luther who laid down the\r\nprinciples that led to the disintegration of dogmatic Christianity,\r\nand in doing what he did Schleiermacher was but proving himself the\r\nworthy pupil of such a master.\r\n\r\nThe unrestrained liberty of thought, claimed by so many Protestant\r\nreformers and theologians and ending as it did in the substitution of\r\na natural for a supernatural religion, could not fail to have an\r\ninfluence in Catholic circles. Many Catholic scholars were close\r\nstudents of the philosophical systems of Wolf and Kant in Germany, and\r\nof the writings of the Encyclopaedists in France. They were convinced\r\nthat Scholasticism, however valuable it might have been in the\r\nthirteenth century, was antiquated and out of harmony with modern\r\nprogress, that it should be dropped entirely from the curriculum of\r\nstudies, and with it should go many of the theological accretions to\r\nwhich it had given rise. Catholicism, it was thought, if it were to\r\nhold the field as a world-wide religion, must be remodelled so as to\r\nbring it better into line with the conclusions of modern philosophy.\r\nLess attention should be paid to dogma and to polemical discussions,\r\nand more to the ethical and natural principles contained in the\r\nChristian revelation.\r\n\r\nThe spread of Gallicanism and Febronianism and the adoption of these\r\nviews by leading rulers and politicians, thereby weakening the\r\nauthority of the Pope and of the bishops, helped to break down the\r\ndefences of Catholicity, and to make it more easy to propagate\r\nrationalistic views especially amongst those who frequented the\r\nuniversities. As a rule it was only the higher and middle classes that\r\nwere affected by the /Aufklarung/. Everywhere throughout Europe, in\r\nFrance, in Spain, in Portugal, in Germany, and in Austria this\r\nadvanced liberalism made itself felt in the last half of the\r\neighteenth century, particularly after the suppression of the Jesuits\r\nhad removed the only body capable of resisting it successfully at the\r\ntime, and had secured for their opponents a much stronger hold in the\r\ncentres of education.\r\n\r\nIt was in Germany and Austria that the /Aufklarung/ movement attracted\r\nthe greatest attention. The Scholastic system of philosophy had been\r\nabandoned in favour of the teaching of the Leibniz-Wolf school and of\r\nKant. The entire course of study for ecclesiastical students underwent\r\na complete reorganisation. Scholasticism, casuistry, and controversy\r\nwere eliminated. Their places were taken by Patrology, Church History,\r\nPastoral Theology, and Biblical Exegesis of the kind then in vogue in\r\nProtestant schools.\r\n\r\nThe plan of studies drawn up by Abbot Rautenstrauch, rector of the\r\nUniversity of Vienna (1774), for the theological students of that\r\ninstitution meant nothing less than a complete break with the whole\r\ntraditional system of clerical education. In itself it had much to\r\nrecommend it, but the principles that underlay its introduction, and\r\nthe class of men to whom its administration was entrusted, were enough\r\nto render it suspicious. The director of studies in Austria, Baron von\r\nSwieten, himself in close contact with the Jansenists and the\r\nEncyclopaedists, favoured the introduction of the new plan into all the\r\nAustrian universities and colleges, and took good care, besides, that\r\nonly men of liberal views were appointed to the chairs. In the hands\r\nof professors like Jahn and Fischer, Scriptural Exegesis began to\r\npartake more and more of the rationalism of the Protestant schools;\r\nChurch History as expounded by Dannenmayr, Royko, and Gmeiner, became\r\nin great part an apology for Gallicanism; the Moral Theology taught by\r\nDanzer and Reyberger was modelled largely on a purely rational system\r\nof ethics, and the Canon Law current in the higher schools was in\r\ncomplete harmony with the views of Febronius and Joseph II.\r\n\r\nThe Prince-bishops of Mainz, Trier, and Cologne spared no pains to\r\npropagate these liberal views amongst those who were to be the future\r\npriests in their territories. In the University of Mainz Isenbiehl's\r\nviews on Scripture brought him into conflict with the Church; Blau,\r\nthe professor of dogma, denied the infallibility of the Church and of\r\nGeneral Councils; while Dorsch, the professor of philosophy, was an\r\nardent disciple of Kant. A similar state of affairs prevailed at the\r\nUniversity of Trier, at Bonn which was established for the express\r\npurpose of combatting the ultramontanism and conservatism of Cologne,\r\nand to a more or less degree at Freiburg, Wurzburg, Ingolstadt, and\r\nMunich. By means of the universities and by the publication of various\r\nreviews these liberal theories were spread throughout Germany. An\r\nattempt was made to reform the discipline and liturgy of the Church so\r\nas to bring them into harmony with the new theology. Many advocated\r\nthe abolition of popular devotions, the substitution of German for the\r\nLatin language in the missal and in the ritual, and the abolition of\r\nclerical celibacy.\r\n\r\nIn Bavaria matters reached a crisis when Weishaupt, a professor of\r\ncanon law in Ingolstadt, founded a secret society known as the\r\n/Illuminati/ for the overthrow of the Church and the civil authority,\r\nto make way for a universal republic in which the only religion would\r\nbe the religion of humanity. His speculative views were borrowed\r\nlargely from the Encyclopaedists, and his plan of organisation from the\r\nFreemasons. At first the society was confined to students, but with\r\nthe accession of the Freiherr von Knigge it was determined to widen\r\nthe sphere of its operations. Every effort was made to secure\r\nrecruits. The Freemasons gave it strong support, and Ferdinand of\r\nBrunswick became one of its members. It had its statutes, ritual, and\r\ndecrees. Fortunately the members quarrelled, and were foolish enough\r\nto carry their controversies into the public press. In this way the\r\nBavarian government became acquainted with the dangerous character of\r\nthe sect of the /Illuminati/, and a determined effort was made to\r\nsecure its suppression (1784-1785).\r\n\r\n\r\n                           (c) Freemasonry.\r\n\r\n  Gould, /History of Freemasonry/, 3 vols., 1883-87.

Hughan, /Origin of the\r\n  English Rite of Freemasonry/, 1884.\r\n\r\nWhatever about the value of the fantastic legends invented to explain\r\nthe origin of Freemasonry it is certain that the first grand lodge was\r\nformed in London on the Feast of St. John the Baptist (1717). That\r\nbefore this date there were a few scattered lodges in England,\r\nScotland, and Ireland, and that these lodges were the sole remaining\r\nrelics of a peculiar trade guild, composed of masons and of some of\r\nthe higher classes as honorary members, there can be little doubt. The\r\nsociety spread rapidly in England, Scotland, and amongst the\r\nProtestant colony in Ireland. From Great Britain its principles were\r\ndiffused throughout the rest of Europe. Freemason lodges were\r\nestablished in Paris (1725-1732), in Germany (1733), Portugal (1735),\r\nHolland (1735), Switzerland (1740), Denmark (1745), Italy (1763), and\r\nSweden (1773). The Freemasons were bound together into a secret\r\nsociety, the members of which were obliged by oath and by the threat\r\nof severe penalties to obey orders and to maintain silence regarding\r\nits affairs. The society had its ritual, its degrees of apprentice,\r\nfellow, and master, and its passports and signs. The particular lodges\r\nin each country were united under a national grand lodge, and though\r\nthe various attempts that have been made to bring about an\r\ninternational organisation have failed, yet there can be little doubt\r\nthat Freemasons throughout the world maintain the closest relations,\r\nand at least in general policy act usually as one man. Freemasonry was\r\npatronised by members of the royal family in England, by Frederick II.\r\nof Prussia, Francis I. of Austria, the Grand Duke Francis Stephen of\r\nTuscany, and by Philip Duke of Orleans, who accepted the office of\r\ngrand master in France. Its members were recruited principally from\r\nthe higher and middle classes, as the entrance fees and expenses made\r\nit impossible for anybody except the comparatively wealthy to become\r\nmembers. At the time when the society was formed it was the nobility\r\nand middle classes who formed public opinion in most countries, and it\r\nwas thought that if these classes could be won over to support the\r\nprinciples of Freemasonry, they in turn could influence the mass of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nFreemasonry was established at a time when Deism and Naturalism were\r\nrampant in England, and it secured a foothold in most of the\r\ncontinental countries in an age noted for its hostility to\r\nsupernatural religion. In the first article of the /Old Charges/\r\n(1723) it is laid down that, \"A mason is obliged by his tenure to obey\r\nthe moral law, and if he really understands the art he will never be a\r\nstupid atheist or an irreligious libertine.\" The precise meaning of\r\nthis injunction has been the subject of many controversies, but it is\r\nclear from the continuation of the same article that the universal\r\nreligion on which all men are agreed, that is to say, a kind of\r\nnatural Christianity, was to be the religion of Freemasonry. The\r\nsociety professed to be non-sectarian in its objects, but the whole\r\ntendency of the rules and of the organisation in its practical working\r\nhas been to promote contempt for dogmatic orthodoxy and for religious\r\nauthority, and to foster a kind of modified Christianity from which\r\nspecifically Catholic doctrines have been eliminated.\r\n\r\nIn France and in Austria Freemasons and Rationalists worked hand in\r\nhand for the overthrow of the established Church and for the spread of\r\natheistical views. The society professed also to forbid political\r\ndiscussions, but here too the articles of the constitution are\r\nintentionally vague, and it is fairly evident that in most of the\r\nrevolutions that have disturbed the peace of Europe during the last\r\nhundred years Freemasons have exercised a very powerful influence. For\r\nmany reasons the anti-religious and revolutionary tendencies of\r\nFreemasonry have been more striking in the Latin countries, France,\r\nSpain, Portugal, and Italy, than in England or Germany. In 1877 the\r\nGrand Orient of France abolished the portions of the constitution that\r\nseemed to admit the existence of God and the immortality of the soul,\r\nand remodelled the ritual so as to exclude all references to religious\r\ndogma. This action led to a rupture between the Grand Orient and the\r\nlodges of England, Germany, and America. Yet many of the Freemasons in\r\nthese latter countries sympathised with the attitude of their French\r\nbrethren, and insisted on interpreting after their own fashion the\r\nvery ambiguous formula by which the existence of a grand architect is\r\nrecognised. There can be no doubt that even in England a man may be a\r\nFreemason accepting loyally all its articles, and yet refuse to\r\nbelieve in the existence of a personal God distinct from the world.\r\nFreemasonry aims at establishing a spirit of comradeship and\r\nbrotherhood among its members. They are bound to aid one another in\r\nevery possible way and practically in all conceivable circumstances.\r\nHowever objectionable such a practice, and however dangerous to the\r\npublic weal and to the interests of the state it may be, it is\r\nprecisely this feature of the society that won for it its greatest\r\nnumber of adherents.\r\n\r\nFreemasonry was condemned by Clement XII. in 1738. In the constitution\r\n/In eminenti/, in which this condemnation was promulgated, he\r\nexplained the reasons that induced him to take this step. These were\r\nthe anti-religious tendencies of the society both in its theory and\r\npractice, the oaths of secrecy and obedience to unknown superiors, and\r\nthe danger to Church and State involved in such secret combinations.\r\nThis condemnation has been renewed by several of his successors, as\r\nfor example Benedict XIV. (1751), Pius VII. (1821), Gregory XVI.\r\n(1832), Pius IX. (1865), and Leo XIII. (1884). Since 1738 Catholics\r\nhave been forbidden under penalty of excommunication to become members\r\nof the society or to promote its success. According to the\r\nconstitution /Apostolicae Sedis/ (1869), which is in force at the\r\npresent time, excommunication is levelled against those who join the\r\nFreemasons or similar bodies that plot against the Church and\r\nestablished authority, as well as against those who favour such\r\norganisations and do not denounce their leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n             (d) The Suppression of the Society of Jesus.\r\n\r\n  Cretineau-Joly, /Clement XIV. et les Jesuites/, 1847.

In the defence of the\r\nChurch, especially in Germany, Austria, Poland, Hungary, and France,\r\nin the domain of education and of literature, in the work of spreading\r\nChristianity amongst the races and peoples in India, China, Japan, and\r\nAmerica, the Jesuit Fathers took the foremost place. They laboured\r\nincessantly to stay the inroads of heresy, to instil Catholic\r\nprinciples into the minds of the rising generation, and to win new\r\nrecruits to take the place of those who had gone over to the enemy.\r\n\r\nBut their very success was sufficient to arouse the wrath of their\r\nadversaries and the jealousy of their rivals. Lutherans and\r\nCalvinists, enraged by the success of the Counter-Reformation,\r\ndenounced the Jesuits as enemies of progress and enlightenment, whose\r\nvery existence was a danger to the peace and the liberty of Europe.\r\nThese charges were re-echoed by Jansenists and Gallicans, by infidel\r\nphilosophers and absolutist politicians, and, stranger still, by many\r\nwhose orthodoxy could not be questioned, but whose judgment was warped\r\nby their annoyance at the wonderful success of a comparatively young\r\norganisation. The Jesuits were accused of favouring laxity of morals\r\non account of the support given by some of them to Probabilism, of\r\nsympathising with Pelagianism on account of the doctrine of Molina, of\r\nsupporting tyrannicide on the strength of the work of Mariana, of\r\nupholding absolutism on account of their close relations with the\r\nrulers of France, and Spain, and of seeking to undermine governments\r\nand constitutions by their secret political schemes and their\r\nexcessive wealth. Garbled extracts taken from the works of individual\r\nJesuits were published as representing the opinions of the body, and\r\nthe infamous /Monita Secreta/, purporting to contain the instruction\r\nof Aquaviva to his subjects, was forged (1612) to bring discredit upon\r\nthe Society.[1]\r\n\r\nMore than once the combined assaults of its enemies seemed on the\r\npoint of being crowned with success. During Aquaviva's tenure of\r\noffice as general (1585-1615) the society was banished from France and\r\nfrom Venice, while the demands of the Spanish Jesuits for a Spanish\r\nsuperior, backed as it was by the influence of the court, threatened\r\nto destroy the unity of the Society. Again in the time of Paul Oliva\r\n(1664-1681) and Charles Noyelle (1682-1686) controversies regarding\r\nJansenism, Probabilism, the /Regalia/, and the Gallican Declaration of\r\nthe French clergy (1682), endangered the existence of the Society in\r\nFrance, and threatened to lead to misunderstandings with the Holy See,\r\nbut under the Providence of God these dangers were averted, and the\r\neighteenth century found the Jesuits still vigorous in Europe and not\r\nless vigorous in their labours among the heathen nations.\r\n\r\nBut their opponents though beaten time and again were not\r\ndisheartened. The infidel philosophers of the eighteenth century\r\nrecognised in the Jesuits the ablest defenders of the Catholic Church.\r\nIf only they could succeed in removing them, as Voltaire declared, the\r\nwork of destroying the Church seemed comparatively easy. Hence they\r\nunited all their forces for one grand assault upon the Society as the\r\nbulwark of Christianity. They were assisted in their schemes by the\r\nJansenists, eager to avenge the defeat they had received at the hands\r\nof the Jesuits, and by the absolutist statesmen and rulers of Europe,\r\nwho aimed at the enslavement of the Church, and who feared the Jesuits\r\nas the ablest exponents of the rights of religion and of the Holy See.\r\nThe Jesuits controlled to a great extent Catholic education both lay\r\nand clerical, and it was hoped that by installing teachers devoted to\r\nstate supremacy and Enlightenment in their place the future of\r\nabsolutism and of rationalism might be assured.\r\n\r\nThe attack on the Jesuits was begun in Portugal during the reign of\r\nJoseph Emmanuel (1750-1777). He was a man of liberal views, anxious to\r\npromote the welfare of his country, as well as to strengthen the power\r\nof the crown. In accomplishing these objects he was guided by the\r\nadvice of the prime minister, Joseph Sebastian Carvalho, better known\r\nas the Marquis of Pombal.[2] The latter had travelled much, and was\r\nthoroughly imbued with the liberal and rationalistic spirit of the\r\nage. He regarded the Catholic Church as an enemy of material progress,\r\nand the Jesuits as the worst teachers to whom the youth of any country\r\ncould be entrusted. A treaty concluded with Spain, according to which\r\nthe Spaniards were to surrender to Portugal seven of the Reductions of\r\nParaguay in return for San Sacramento, afforded him the long desired\r\nopportunity of attacking the Jesuits (1750). The Indians on the\r\nReductions, who had been converted by the Jesuits, were to be banished\r\nfrom their lands to make way for mining operations in search of gold,\r\nand though the Jesuits tried hard to induce their people to submit to\r\nthis decree, the Indians, maddened by the injustice and cruelty of the\r\ntreatment of the Portuguese, rose in revolt. The Jesuits were blamed\r\nfor having fomented the rebellion. By orders of Pombal they were\r\narrested and brought to Portugal, where the most extravagant charges\r\nwere published against them in order to damage them in the eyes of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese government appealed to Benedict XIV. to take action\r\nagainst the Society. The Pope appointed Saldanha an apostolic visitor\r\nto examine into the charges that had been made. Though the\r\ninstructions laid down for the guidance of the visitor were precise in\r\nevery detail, Saldanha, unmindful of the restrictions imposed by the\r\nPope and without hearing any evidence that might favour the accused,\r\ndecided against the Jesuits and procured the withdrawal of their\r\nfaculties in Lisbon (1758). In September of that year a plot directed\r\nagainst one of the royal officials, but supposed to have for its\r\nobject the murder of the king, was discovered and attributed without\r\nany evidence to the Jesuits. They and many of their supposed allies\r\namong the nobility were arrested and thrown into prison; their schools\r\nwere closed, and various fruitless attempts were made to induce the\r\nyounger members to disown the Society. Finally in September 1759 a\r\ndecree of banishment was issued against the Jesuits. Most of them were\r\narrested and despatched to the Papal States, while others of them,\r\nless fortunate, were confined as prisoners in the jails of Portugal.\r\nFather Malagrida, one of the ablest and most saintly men of the\r\nSociety, was put to death on a trumped-up charge of heresy (1761).\r\nClement XIII. (1758-1769) made various attempts to save the Society,\r\nand to prevent a breach with Portugal, but Pombal determined to push\r\nmatters to extremes. The Portuguese ambassador at Rome suddenly broke\r\noff negotiations with the Holy See and left the city, while the nuncio\r\nat Lisbon was escorted to the Spanish frontier (1760). For a period of\r\nten years (1760-1770) friendly relations between Rome and Portugal\r\nwere interrupted.\r\n\r\nIn France the Jesuits had many powerful friends, but they had also\r\nmany able and determined enemies. The Jansenists who controlled the\r\nParliament of Paris, the Rationalists, the Gallicans, and not a few of\r\nthe doctors of the Sorbonne, though divided on nearly every other\r\nissue, made common cause against the Society. They were assisted in\r\ntheir campaign by Madame de Pompadour, the king's mistress, for whom\r\nthe Jesuit theology was not sufficiently lax, and by the Duc de\r\nChoiseul, the king's prime minister. The well-known Jesuit leanings of\r\nLouis XV. and of the royal family generally, imposed a certain measure\r\nof restraint upon the enemies of the Society, until the famous La\r\nValette law suit offered its opponents an opportunity of stirring up\r\npublic feeling and of overcoming the scruples of the weak-minded king.\r\nThe Jesuits had a very important mission in the island of Martinique.\r\nThe natives were employed on their large mission lands, the fruits of\r\nwhich were spent in promoting the spiritual and temporal welfare of\r\nthe people. La Valette, the Jesuit superior on the island, had been\r\nvery successful in his business transactions, and encouraged by his\r\nsuccess, he borrowed money in France to develop the resources of the\r\nmission. This money he could have repaid without difficulty, had it\r\nnot been that during the war between France and England some vessels\r\nbearing his merchandise were seized by the English (1755). La Valette\r\nwas in consequence of this unable to pay his creditors, some of whom\r\nsought to recover their debts by instituting a civil process against\r\nthe procurator of the Paris province. For several reasons the Jesuits,\r\nthough not unwilling to make a reasonable settlement, refused to\r\nacknowledge any responsibility. The creditors insisted on bringing the\r\ncase to trial, and the court at Marseilles decided in their favour.\r\nThe Jesuit procurator then appealed to the Parliament of Paris, at\r\nthat time strongly Jansenist in its tendencies. The Parliament, not\r\ncontent with upholding the verdict, took advantage of the popular\r\nfeeling aroused against the Society to institute a criminal process\r\nagainst the entire body (1761).\r\n\r\nA commission was appointed to examine the constitutions and privileges\r\nof the Jesuits. It reported that the Society was dangerous to the\r\nstate, hostile to the /Gallican Liberties/, and unlawful. The writings\r\nof Bellarmine and Busenbaum were ordered to be burned, and the famous\r\n/Extrait des Assertions/, a kind of blue-book containing a selection\r\nof unpopular views defended by Jesuit writers, was published to show\r\nthe dangerous tendencies of the Society and to prejudice it in the\r\neyes of the people. The Provincial of the Jesuits offered for himself\r\nand his subjects to accept the Declaration of the French clergy and to\r\nobey the instructions of the bishops, but the offer, besides being\r\ndispleasing to the Roman authorities, did not soften the wrath of the\r\nanti-Jesuit party, who sought nothing less than the total destruction\r\nof the Society.\r\n\r\nLouis XV. endeavoured to bring about a compromise by procuring the\r\nappointment of a vicar for France. With this object he called a\r\nmeeting of the French bishops (1761), the vast majority of whom had\r\nnothing but praise for the work of the Jesuits, and wished for no\r\nchange in the constitution of the Society. Similar views were\r\nexpressed by the assembly of the French clergy in 1762. Clement XIII.\r\nlaboured energetically in defence of the Jesuits, but in open\r\ndisregard of his advice and his entreaties, the decree for the\r\nsuppression of the Society was passed by Parliament in 1762, though\r\nits execution was delayed by orders of the king. Meanwhile proposals\r\nwere made to the Pope and to the general, Ricci,[3] for a change in\r\nthe constitution, so as to secure the appointment of an independent\r\nsuperior for France, which proposal was rejected by both Pope and\r\ngeneral. In 1763 the Jesuit colleges were closed; members of the\r\nSociety were required to renounce their vows under threat of\r\nbanishment, and, as hardly any members complied with this condition,\r\nthe decree of banishment was promulgated in 1764. Clement XIII.\r\npublished a Bull defending the constitution of the Society, and\r\nrejecting the charge against its members (1765), while the French\r\nbishops addressed an earnest appeal to the king on its behalf (1765).\r\n\r\nThe example of Portugal and France was soon followed by Spain. Charles\r\nIII. (1759-1788) was an able ruler, anxious to restore the former\r\ngreatness of his country by encouraging the establishment of\r\nindustries and by favouring the introduction of foreign capital and\r\nforeign skill. He was by no means irreligious, but he was influenced\r\nlargely by the liberal tendencies of the age, as were also in a more\r\nmarked degree his two principal ministers Aranda and de Roda. Popular\r\nfeeling was aroused by the favour which the king showed towards French\r\ncapitalists and artisans, and in some places ugly commotions took\r\nplace. The ministers suggested to the king that the Jesuits were\r\nbehind this movement, and were the authors of certain dangerous and\r\ninflammatory pamphlets. Secret councils were held, as a result of\r\nwhich sealed instructions were issued to the governors of all towns in\r\nwhich Jesuit houses were situated that on a fixed night the Jesuits\r\nshould be arrested (1767). These orders were carried out to the\r\nletter. Close on six thousand Jesuits were taken and hurried to the\r\ncoast, where vessels were waiting to transport them to the Papal\r\nStates. When this had been accomplished a royal decree was issued\r\nsuppressing the Society in Spain owing to certain weighty reasons\r\nwhich the king was unwilling to divulge. Clement XIII. remonstrated\r\nvigorously against such violent measures, but the only effect of his\r\nremonstrances was that the bishops who defended the papal interference\r\nwere banished, those who would seek to favour the return of the\r\nSociety were declared guilty of high treason, and the punishment of\r\ndeath was levelled against any Jesuit who attempted to land in Spain.\r\n\r\nIn Naples, where Ferdinand, son of Charles III. of Spain then ruled,\r\nthe suppression of the Jesuits was planned and carried out by the\r\nprime minister, Tanucci, a man hardly less unfriendly to the Society\r\nthan Pombal. The Jesuits were arrested without any trial, and were\r\nsent across the frontier into the Papal States (Nov. 1767). Much the\r\nsame fate awaited them in the territories of the Duke of Parma and\r\nPiacenza, where the minister du Tillot had pursued for years a\r\ncampaign against the rights of the Catholic Church. In 1768 Clement\r\nXIII. issued a strong protest against the policy of the Parmese\r\ngovernment. This aroused the ire of the whole Bourbon family. France,\r\nSpain, and Naples demanded the withdrawal of this /Monitorium/ under\r\nthreat of violence. The Papal States of Avignon and Venaissin were\r\noccupied by French troops, while Naples seized Benevento and\r\nPontecorvo. Various attempts were made to secure the support of the\r\nEmpress Maria Theresa, and to stir up opposition in the smaller\r\nkingdoms of Italy. But Clement XIII., undaunted by the threats of\r\nviolence of the Bourbons, refused to yield to their demands for the\r\nsuppression of a Society, against which nothing had been proved, and\r\nagainst which nothing could be proved except its ardent defence of the\r\nCatholic Church and its attachment to the Holy See. In January 1769 an\r\nultimatum was presented by the ambassadors of France, Spain, and\r\nNaples demanding the suppression of the Society. The Pope refused to\r\nagree to it, but before the threats it contained could be carried into\r\nexecution Clement XIII. passed away (Feb. 1769).\r\n\r\nIn the conclave that followed the Bourbon rulers made every effort to\r\nsecure the election of a Pope favourable to their views. Their\r\nrepresentatives were instructed to use the veto freely against all\r\ncardinals known to be favourable to the Jesuits. After a struggle\r\nlasting three months Cardinal Ganganelli was elected and took the\r\ntitle Clement XIV. (1769-1774). He restored friendly relations with\r\nParma, opened negotiations with Portugal, created the brother of\r\nPombal a cardinal, appointed Pereira, one of the court theologians, to\r\na Portuguese bishopric, despatched a nuncio to Lisbon, and brought\r\nabout a formal reconciliation (1770).\r\n\r\nIt is not true that before his election Clement XIV. had bound himself\r\nformally to suppress the Jesuits. Hardly, however, had he been crowned\r\nwhen demands were made upon him by the representatives of France and\r\nSpain similar to those presented to his predecessor. Clement XIV.\r\npromised to agree to the suppression (1769), but asked for time to\r\nconsider such a momentous step. In the hope of satisfying the\r\nopponents of the Jesuits the Pope adopted an unfriendly attitude\r\ntowards the Society, and appointed apostolic visitors to examine into\r\nthe affairs of the seminaries and colleges under its control, from\r\nmost of which, as a result of the investigation, the Jesuits were\r\ndismissed. He offered to bring about a complete change in the\r\nconstitution of the Society, but this offer, too, was rejected.\r\nCharles III. of Spain forwarded an ultimatum in which he insisted upon\r\nthe instant suppression of the Society under threat of recalling his\r\nambassador from Rome. This ultimatum had the approval of all the\r\nBourbon rulers. Faced with such a terrible danger, the courage of\r\nClement XIV. failed him, and he determined to accept the suppression\r\nas the lesser of two evils (1772). In July 1773 the Brief /Dominus ac\r\nRedemptor noster/, decreeing the suppression of the Society in the\r\ninterests of peace and religion, was signed by the Pope. The houses of\r\nthe Jesuits in the Papal States were surrounded by soldiers, and the\r\ngeneral, Ricci, was confined as a prisoner in the castle of St.\r\nAngelo. The decree was forwarded to the bishops to be communicated by\r\nthem to the Jesuits resident in their dioceses. In most of the\r\ncountries of Europe the decree of suppression was carried out to the\r\nletter, the Jesuits as a body submitting loyally to the decision of\r\nthe Pope.\r\n\r\nCatharine II. of Russia, however, and Frederick II. of Prussia were\r\nimpressed so favourably by the work of the Jesuits as educators that\r\nthey forbade the bishops to publish the decree in their territories.\r\nIn 1776 an agreement was arrived at between Pius VI. and Frederick\r\nII., according to which the Jesuits in Prussian territory were to be\r\ndisbanded formally and were to lay aside their dress, but they were\r\npermitted to continue under a different name to direct the colleges\r\nwhich they possessed. The Empress Catherine II. of Russia continued\r\ntill her death to protect the Society. In 1778 she insisted upon the\r\nerection of a novitiate, for which oral permission seems to have been\r\ngiven by Pius VI. In the other countries many of the Jesuits laboured\r\nas secular priests, others of them united in the congregation, known\r\nas the Fathers of the Faith (1797), and others still in the\r\ncongregation of the Fathers of the Sacred Heart. In 1803 the English\r\nJesuit community at Stonyhurst was allowed to affiliate with the\r\nRussian congregation; in 1804 the Society was re-established with the\r\npermission of Pius VII. in Naples, and in 1814 the Pope issued the\r\nBull, /Sollicitudo omnium Ecclesiarum/ formally re-establishing the\r\nSociety. Strange to say the very next year (1815) a persecution broke\r\nout against the Jesuits in Saint Petersburg, and in 1820 they were\r\nexpelled from Russian territory.\r\n\r\nIt was fear of the Bourbon rulers that forced Clement XIV. to agree to\r\nthe suppression of the Jesuits. By sacrificing a society that had been\r\nnoted for its loyal defence of and submission to the Pope, he had\r\nhoped to restore peace to the Church, and to avert the many calamities\r\nthat threatened its very existence in France, Spain, Portugal, and\r\nNaples. But he lived long enough to realise that his weakness led only\r\nto new and more exorbitant demands, and that the professors, who had\r\ntaken the chairs vacated by the Jesuits, were only too ready to place\r\ntheir voices and their pens at the disposal of the civil power and\r\nagainst the Holy See. The suppression of the Society was hailed as a\r\nveritable triumph by the forces of irreligion and rationalism. The\r\nschemes that this party had been concocting for years were at last\r\ncrowned with success; the strongest of the outposts had been captured,\r\nand it only remained to make one last desperate assault on the\r\nfortress itself. The civil rulers, who had allowed themselves to be\r\nused as tools for promoting the designs of the rationalists and the\r\nFreemasons, had soon reason to regret the cruelty and violence with\r\nwhich they treated the Society of Jesus. In a few years the Revolution\r\nwas in full swing; the thrones of France, Spain, Portugal and Naples\r\nwere overturned, and those members of the royal families, who escaped\r\nthe scaffold or the dungeon, were themselves driven to seek refuge in\r\nforeign lands, as the Jesuits had been driven in the days of Clement\r\nXIV.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] On the /Monita Secreta/, cf.

It was no longer with Luther, or Calvin, or Zwingli\r\nthat Catholic theologians were called upon to negotiate, nor was it\r\nsufficient for them to concentrate their attention upon the refutation\r\nof the /Confessio Augustana/ or the /Confessio Tetrapolitana/. The\r\nleading followers of the early Reformers found themselves justified in\r\nquestioning the teaching of their masters, for reasons exactly similar\r\nto those that had been alleged by their masters in defence of their\r\nattack on the Catholic Church. The principle of religious authority\r\nhaving been rejected, individuals felt free to frame their own\r\nstandard of orthodoxy, and were it not for the civil rulers, who\r\ninterfered to preserve their states from the temporal dangers of\r\nreligious anarchy, and to supply by their own power some organisation\r\nto take the place of the Catholic hierarchy, Calvinism and Lutheranism\r\nwould have assumed almost as many forms as there were individuals who\r\nprofessed to accept these religious systems. As it was, despite the\r\nreligious formularies, drawn up for the most part at the instigation\r\nand on the advice of the civil rulers, it proved impossible for man to\r\nreplace the old bulwarks established by Christ to safeguard the\r\ndeposit of faith. As a consequence new sects made their appearance in\r\nevery country that accepted the reformed doctrine.\r\n\r\nIn France some attempts were made by Cardinal Richelieu to bring about\r\na reunion between the Catholics and the Calvinists. In taking these\r\nsteps he was influenced more by considerations of state than by zeal\r\nfor the welfare of the Church, but the gulf separating the two parties\r\nwas too wide to be bridged over even by French patriotism. In Poland,\r\nwhere unity was particularly required and where the disastrous\r\nconsequences of religious strife were only too apparent, Ladislaus V.\r\ndetermined to summon a conference at Thorn in 1645 to discuss the\r\nreligious differences, but though it was attended by representatives\r\nfrom several states of Germany it produced no good results.\r\n\r\nIn Germany the work, that had proved too great for the theologians,\r\nwas undertaken by the princes in 1644, with no better results. Later\r\non, at the instigation of the Emperor, Christopher Royas de Spinola,\r\nan Austrian bishop, spent the last twenty years of his life (1675-\r\n1695) in a vain effort to put an end to the religious dispute.\r\nHeedless of repeated rebuffs, he passed from court to court in Germany\r\ntill at last at Hanover he saw some prospect of success. Duke Ernest\r\nAugust assembled a conference of Lutheran theologians (1679), the\r\nprincipal of whom was Molanus, a Protestant abbot of Loccum. The\r\nLutheran theologians were willing to agree that all Christians should\r\nreturn immediately to their obedience to the Pope, on condition,\r\nhowever, that the decrees of the Council of Trent should be suspended,\r\nand that a new General Council composed of representatives of all\r\nparties should be assembled to discuss the principal points in\r\ndispute. On his side Royas was inclined to yield a good deal in regard\r\nto clerical celibacy and the authority of secular princes in\r\necclesiastical affairs. Innocent XI., while not approving of what had\r\nbeen done, praised the bishop for the efforts he had made to bring\r\nabout a reunion.\r\n\r\nLeibniz, the librarian and archivist of the Duke of Brunswick, having\r\ntaken already some part in the work of bringing about a\r\nreconciliation, entered into a correspondence with Bossuet, the Bishop\r\nof Meaux. He favoured a compromise on the basis of acceptance of the\r\nbeliefs of the first five centuries, and published his /Systema\r\nTheologicum/ as a means of bringing the Catholic standpoint before the\r\nminds of his co-religionists. Bossuet and the French historian\r\nPellisson reciprocated his efforts, but the schemes of Louis XIV. and\r\nthe hopes of the English succession entertained by the House of\r\nBrunswick out an end to all chances of success.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, though Luther and Zwingli were at one in their\r\nopposition to Rome, they were unable to agree upon a common religious\r\nplatform. The Sacramentarian controversy, confined at first to Luther\r\nand Carlstadt, grew more embittered after Zwingli had espoused openly\r\nthe side of the latter. Several German princes having embraced the\r\nviews of Zwingli, it was felt necessary to preserve some kind of unity\r\namongst the Reformers, especially in view of the threatening attitude\r\nassumed by Charles V. A conference was called at Marburg (1529), at\r\nwhich Luther, Melanchthon, Osiander, and Agricola agreed to meet\r\nZwingli, Oecolampadius, Butzer, and the other Swiss leaders. The\r\nconference failed to arrive at a satisfactory agreement, but in 1536\r\nthe Concord of Wittenberg was concluded, whereby it was hoped that\r\npeace might be restored by the adoption of a very ambiguous formula.\r\nLuther, however, refused to allow himself to be bound by the\r\nagreement, and the controversy went on as violently as before.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Calvin had undertaken to preach doctrines on the\r\nEucharist entirely different from those put forward by either Zwingli\r\nor Luther, with the result that Zurich found itself in conflict with\r\nGeneva as it had found itself previously in conflict with Wittenberg.\r\nTo restore some semblance of unity among the Swiss Reformers\r\nBullinger, the recognised head of the Zurich party, entered into\r\ncommunication with Calvin, and a doctrinal agreement was arrived at\r\nknown as the /Consensus Tigurinus/ (The Zurich Concord) in 1549. Later\r\non this was confirmed by the /Confessio Helvetica/ (1564).\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Luther in 1545 Melanchthon became the acknowledged\r\nhead of the Lutheran party. On many questions he was inclined to\r\ndisagree with the doctrine of his master. His teaching in regard to\r\nthe Eucharist began to approximate more closely to the views of\r\nCalvin, so that the Impanation and Companation theories of Luther lost\r\nfavour in Germany. The Philippists or Crypto-Calvinists gained ground\r\nrapidly in the country, with the result that the German Protestants\r\nwere split up into hostile sections. A conference was held at Naumburg\r\nin 1561, but it broke up without having done anything to restore\r\nreligious unity. At last in 1576 the Elector August of Saxony summoned\r\nan assembly of theologians to meet at Torgau, for the discussion of\r\nthe differences that had arisen between the orthodox followers of\r\nLuther and the Crypto-Calvinists or followers of Melanchthon. Jacob\r\nAndrea, chancellor of the University of Tubingen, was the life and\r\nsoul of the reunion movement. Taking the plan of agreement that had\r\nbeen formulated by him as a basis for discussion the conference drew\r\nup the /Book of Torgau/, copies of which were despatched to the\r\nLutheran princes and theologians for an expression of their opinion.\r\nWhen this had been received the /Book of Torgau/ was revised (1577)\r\nand a Formula of Concord (/Formula Concordiae/) was compiled,\r\nembodying the Confession of Augsburg, Melanchthon's Apology for this\r\nConfession, the Articles of Schmalkald and the two Catechisms issued\r\nby Luther (1577). But as there was no authority to enforce this\r\nFormula several of the states refused to accept it.\r\n\r\nIn Saxony under Christian I. (1586-91) the Philippists in favour at\r\ncourt triumphed over their adversaries, but on the death of Christian\r\nthe orthodox Lutherans secured the upper hand, and Nicholas Crell, the\r\nprime minister and chancellor of Saxony during the previous reign, was\r\nthrown into prison, and later on he was put to death (1601). Calvinism\r\ncontinued to make steady progress in Germany. It was introduced into\r\nthe Palatinate during the reign of Frederick III. (1583), and though\r\nsuppressed by his son and successor, it gained the upper hand.\r\nSimilarly in Hesse-Cassel, in Lippe, Brandenburg, and Anhalt, it\r\ngained many new adherents. All attempts at peace amongst the warring\r\nsects having failed, Calvinism was recognised formally at the Peace of\r\nWestphalia (1648).\r\n\r\nViolent controversies broke out among the Lutheran party in Germany on\r\nmany other matters besides the Eucharist. One of the early followers\r\nof Luther named Agricola,[1] afterwards a professor of Wittenberg\r\n(1539), in his efforts to emphasise the teaching of his master on good\r\nworks proclaimed that the spirit of fear so characteristic of the Old\r\nTestament had given way to the mildness and love of the New, and that,\r\ntherefore, Christians who had received justification were no longer\r\nunder the obligations of the law. This is what was known as\r\n/Antinomism/, a form of error not unknown amongst the early Gnostics\r\nand amongst some of the heretical sects of the Middle Ages. Agricola\r\nwas assailed violently by Luther (1538-40), fled to Berlin (1540), and\r\nreturned at a later period to make his submission, but Luther refused\r\nall his attempts at reconciliation. Melanchthon, however, adopted a\r\nmore friendly attitude. The controversy continued for years, and\r\n/Antinomism/ of a much more exaggerated form spread into other\r\ncountries, particularly into England, where Parliament was obliged to\r\nlegislate against its supporters during the reign of Charles I.\r\n\r\nClosely associated with the Antinomist controversy was another known\r\nas the /Osiandrist/,[2] from the name of one of its principal\r\nparticipants, Andrew Osiander. The latter, a professor of Hebrew at\r\nNurnberg, perceiving the dangerous results of Luther's teaching on\r\ngood works sought to introduce some modifications that would obviate\r\nthe danger involved in the latter's apparent contempt for good works.\r\nFor this reason he condemned the general absolution that had been\r\nintroduced to replace auricular confession, and insisted upon the\r\nelevation of the Host as a profession of belief in the doctrine of the\r\nReal Presence. Having become involved in a sharp dispute with his\r\ncolleagues at Nurnberg he left the university, and accepted a\r\nprofessorship at Konigsberg in Prussia (1549), where he was supported\r\nby the ruler Duke Albert. In regard to Justification he taught that\r\nforgiveness of sin and satisfaction should not be confounded with\r\nJustification, that the latter is effected by the indwelling of God in\r\nthe person of the justified, that though the human nature of Christ is\r\na necessary condition for redemption it is by the divine nature that\r\nthe indwelling of God in man is effected, and that on account of this\r\nindwelling the holiness of God is imputed to the creature. This\r\nteaching aroused considerable opposition. Osiander was denounced by\r\nMorlin and others as Anti-Christ. Duke Albert sought the views of\r\nleading theologians only to find that as they were divided themselves\r\nthey could lay down no certain rules for his guidance. Osiander died\r\nin 1552, but the quarrel continued and for a time it seemed as if it\r\nwould lead to rebellion. Finally the adversaries of Osiander\r\ntriumphed, when they secured the insertion of their views in the\r\nPrussian /Corpus Doctrinae/ (1567) and the execution of Funk the\r\nleading supporter of Osiandrism (1601). Another professor of\r\nKonigsberg at this period, Stancarus, maintained that Redemption is to\r\nbe attributed to the human nature rather than to the divine nature of\r\nChrist, but he was expelled from the university, and denounced on all\r\nsides as a Nestorian.\r\n\r\nOn this question of good works a violent controversy broke out after\r\nthe Leipzig /Interim/ (1548). Luther had depreciated entirely the\r\nvalue of good works as a means to salvation. On this point, however,\r\nMelanchthon was willing to make considerable concessions to the\r\nCatholics, as indeed he did in 1535 and 1548, when he admitted that\r\ngood works were necessary for acquiring eternal happiness. This view\r\nwas supported warmly by Major, a professor at Wittenberg, who was\r\ndenounced by Amsdorf as an opponent of Luther's doctrine of\r\nJustification (1551). Amsdorf, Flacius, and others maintained that\r\ngood works were a hindrance rather than an aid to salvation, while\r\nMajor clung tenaciously to the position that good works were\r\nmeritorious. /Majorism/, as the new heresy was called, was denounced\r\nin the most violent terms because it involved a return to the doctrine\r\nof the Papists. Major was suspended from his office as preacher (1556)\r\nand was obliged to make a recantation (1558).\r\n\r\nThe /Adiaphorist/ controversy broke out in connexion with the Leipzig\r\n/Interim/ (1548). In this attempt at reconciliation Melanchthon was\r\nnot unwilling to yield in many points to the Catholic representatives,\r\nand to agree that several of the doctrines and practices of the Church\r\nthat had been assailed by Luther were at least indifferent and might\r\nbe admitted. For this he was attacked by Matthias Flacius, surnamed\r\nIllyricus[3] on account of the place of his birth, a professor of\r\nHebrew at Wittenberg since 1544. The latter protested against the\r\nconcessions made by Melanchthon, denounced as impious the union of\r\nChrist with Belial, and returned to Magdeburg, where he was joined by\r\nAmsdorf and others who supported his contention. He was driven from\r\nthe city and at last died at Frankfurt in 1575.\r\n\r\nThe question of man's co-operation in his conversion gave rise to what\r\nwas known as the /Synergist/ controversy. Luther had laid it down as a\r\nfirst principle that man contributed nothing to the work of his own\r\nconversion, but though Melanchthon agreed with this view in the\r\nbeginning, he was disposed at a later period to attribute some\r\nactivity to the human will, at least in the sense that it must\r\nstruggle against its own weakness. This view was strengthened and\r\ndeveloped by John Pfeffinger, a professor at Leipzig, who taught\r\npublicly the necessity of man's co-operation (1550), and published a\r\ntreatise in defence of this position (1555). Pfeffinger's doctrine\r\naroused the opposition of Amsdorf, Flacius, and the other leaders of\r\nthe orthodox Lutheran party. Leipzig and Wittenberg joined hands to\r\nsupport the doctrine of co-operation, while the majority of the\r\nprofessors at Jena took the opposite side. One of the latter however,\r\nStrigel, supported Pfeffinger, and a public disputation was held at\r\nGotha under the presidency of Duke John Frederick. The Lutheran party\r\ndemanded the punishment of Strigel and his supporters so vigorously\r\nthat the Duke was obliged to arrest them, but, annoyed by the attempt\r\nof the Lutherans to set up a religious dictatorship to the detriment\r\nof the supremacy of the civil ruler, he established a consistory\r\ncomposed of lawyers and officials whose duty it was to superintend the\r\nreligious teaching in his territory. The anti-Synergists, having\r\nprotested against this measure as an infringement of the rights of the\r\nspiritual authority, were expelled, and Jena entered into line with\r\nWittenberg and Leipzig for the defence of Synergism. With the change\r\nof rulers came once more a change of doctrine. The princes, alarmed by\r\nthe violence of the controversy, assembled a conference at Alternburg\r\nin 1568 which lasted four months without arriving at any agreement. On\r\nthe accession of the Elector August the leading opponents of the\r\nSynergists, including a large number of the superintendents and\r\npreachers, were deprived of their offices.\r\n\r\nBy his lectures and teaching at the University of Hemstadt George\r\nCalixt[4] gave rise to a new and prolonged discussion known as the\r\n/Syncretist/ controversy. The Duke of Brunswick having refused to\r\naccept the /Formula of Concord/, the professors at the university\r\nwhich he had founded felt themselves much more free in their teaching\r\nthan those in other centres of Lutheranism. Calixt denied the ubiquity\r\nof Christ's body and the attribution of divine qualities to Christ's\r\nhuman nature. Though a strong opponent of several distinctly Catholic\r\nor Calvinist beliefs he saw much that was good in both, and he longed\r\nfor a reunion of Christendom on the basis of an acceptance of the\r\nbeliefs and practices of the first six centuries. He was charged with\r\naiming at a confusion of all religions, and in proof of this charge it\r\nwas alleged that he rejected the Lutheran teaching on Original Sin and\r\non man's natural powers of doing good even before justification, that\r\nhe defended the meritorious character of good works, the supremacy of\r\nthe Pope, at least /de jure ecclesiastico/, and the sacrifice of the\r\nMass (1639). In 1643 a disputation was held, in which Hornejus, a\r\ncolleague of Calixt, supported his doctrine especially on the\r\nmeritoriousness of good works. The appearance of Calixt at the\r\nconference summoned by the King of Poland in Thorn (1645) to promote a\r\nreunion with Rome, and the friendly attitude which he had adopted\r\ntowards the Catholics and the Calvinists helped to increase the\r\nsuspicions of his adversaries. Calixt died in 1656, but for years\r\nafter his death the spirit of toleration, that he had done so much to\r\nfoster, was one of the distinguishing features of the University of\r\nHelmstadt. It was during this controversy that the Branch Theory,\r\nnamely, that Catholicism, Lutheranism, and Calvinism formed three\r\ndivisions of the one true Church, was formulated clearly for the first\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Calvinists the extremely crude doctrine on Predestination\r\ntaught by Calvin soon proved too much for the faith of many of his\r\nfollowers. Several of them, holding fast by Calvin's teaching,\r\ncontended that regardless of Original Sin God had created some for\r\nglory and others for damnation, that Christ had died only to save the\r\nelect, and that to these alone is given the grace necessary for\r\nsalvation (Supralapsarians). Others, horrified by the cruelty of such\r\na doctrine, maintained that the decree predestining some to hell\r\nfollowed the prevision of Original Sin (Infralapsarians). This view\r\nhad been put forward by Theodore Koonhort, and had found considerable\r\nsupport, but it was attacked by the majority of the Calvinist\r\nministers, and a bitter controversy ensued. The orthodox party\r\nsummoned to their assistance Arminius[5] (Hermanzoon), a distinguished\r\nyoung Calvinist preacher, who had attended the lectures of Beza in\r\nGeneva, but whose strict views were modified considerably by a sojourn\r\nin Italy. Instead of supporting the Supralapsarians, his sympathies\r\nwere entirely on the side of the milder doctrine, and after his\r\nappointment to a professorship at Leyden (1603) he became the\r\nrecognised head of the Infralapsarians. His chief opponent was Gomar,\r\nalso a professor at Leyden, who accused Arminius of Semi-Pelagianism.\r\nArminius, while repudiating such a charge as groundless, rejoined by\r\npointing out that according to his adversaries God was the author of\r\nsin. Both appeared before an Assembly of the States in 1608 to defend\r\ntheir views, and though the majority were inclined to favour Arminius,\r\nsilence was imposed upon the two principals and upon their followers.\r\nIn the next year Arminius himself died (1609), but his doctrines were\r\nupheld by Episcopius supported by the learned jurist, Oldenbarneveld,\r\nand the Humanist, Grotius. In replying to the charge of heresy brought\r\nagainst them the followers of Arminius presented to the States a\r\nRemonstrance embodying their doctrines (1610) and on this account they\r\nwere styled Remonstrants. The States adopted a neutral attitude at\r\nfirst, but, as the Gomarists or anti-Remonstrants violated the\r\ninjunction of silence by founding separate communities, the\r\nauthorities were inclined not merely to tolerate but to support the\r\nRemonstrants.\r\n\r\nMaurice, Prince of Orange, Stadtholder of Holland, anxious to\r\nstrengthen his position by allying himself with the orthodox\r\nCalvinists, began a bitter campaign against the Arminians.\r\nOldenbarneveld and Grotius were arrested and brought before the synod\r\nof Dordrecht (1617), at which the former was condemned to death, while\r\nGrotius was imprisoned for life though he succeeded in escaping after\r\ntwo years. Another Synod was held at Dordrecht (Nov. 1618-April 1619)\r\nto which representatives came from all parts of Holland, the\r\nPalatinate, England, and Scotland. From the beginning the followers of\r\nArminius were admitted only as accused persons, and were called upon\r\nto defend themselves against the charge of heresy. Against them the\r\nauthority of Calvin was urged as if it were infallible. As the\r\nArminians were suspected of republican principles William of Orange\r\nand his supporters were decidedly hostile. The Remonstrants,\r\ndespairing of getting an impartial hearing, left the Synod. The five\r\nArticles contained in the Remonstrance were discussed, and decrees\r\nwere issued regarding those portions of Calvin's doctrine that had\r\nbeen called in question. It was agreed that faith is the pure gift of\r\nGod to be given by God to those whom He has predestined by His own\r\nmercy and without any reference to their merits for election; that\r\nChrist died only for the elect; that man's will does not co-operate in\r\nthe work of his conversion; and that the elect are exempted from the\r\ndominion of sin, so that although they may be guilty of serious crimes\r\nthey can never become enemies of God or forfeit the glory to which\r\nthey were predestined. The decrees of the Synod of Dordrecht were\r\nreceived generally in Holland, Switzerland, France, in the territory\r\nof the Elector of Brandenburg, and in Hesse, but in the other portions\r\nof Calvinist Germany and in the greater part of England they met with\r\nserious opposition.\r\n\r\n/Anabaptists/.[6]--The belief that baptism could not be conferred\r\nvalidly on infants who have not arrived at the use of reason was held\r\nby many of the Middle Age sectaries, and was revived at the time of\r\nthe Reformation. Its supporters, claiming for themselves the liberty\r\nof interpreting the Scriptures according to their own judgment,\r\nmaintained that they had divine sanction for their teaching. The\r\nleaders of the sect in Saxony and Thuringia were Thomas Munzer and\r\nNicholas Storch. They represented the extreme left of the Lutheran\r\nparty maintaining the equality of men and the community of property.\r\nIn Zwickau, where the movement originated, violent disturbances broke\r\nout, and the leaders retired to Wittenberg where they were joined by\r\nCarlstadt. It required the presence of Luther himself to prevent the\r\ncity from falling completely into their hands. Owing to the dangerous\r\ncharacter of the radical principles defended by the Anabaptists\r\nseveral princes of Germany joined hands for their suppression. They\r\nwere defeated at the battle of Frankenberg (1525) and Munzer was\r\narrested and put to death. Before his execution he returned to the\r\nCatholic Church.\r\n\r\nDespite this defeat the party made considerable progress in West\r\nGermany and in the Netherlands, where the people were so disgusted\r\nwith their political and social conditions that they were ready to\r\nlisten to semi-religious, semi-social reformers like the Anabaptists.\r\nThey took possession of the city of Munster in Westphalia. The two\r\nprincipal leaders were John of Leyden (a tailor) and John Matthyas or\r\nMatthieson (a baker), the former of whom was appointed king. The city\r\nwas besieged and captured in 1535, and the principal Anabaptists were\r\nput to death. In Switzerland the movement made considerable progress.\r\nFrom Switzerland it spread into southern Germany, but the triumph of\r\nthe princes during the Peasants' War destroyed the hopes of the\r\nextreme Anabaptists, and forced the sect to discard most of its\r\nfanatical tendencies. The leader of the more modern Anabaptist sect\r\nwas Menno Simonis, a priest who joined the Society in 1535, and after\r\nwhom the Anabaptists are called frequently Mennonites.[7] The latter\r\nrejected infant baptism and Luther's doctrine of Justification by\r\nfaith alone. They protested against oaths even in courts of law and\r\ncapital punishment.\r\n\r\n/Schwenkfeldians/.[8]--This sect owes its origin to Caspar von\r\nSchwenkfeld (1489-1561), a native of Silesia, who, though attached to\r\nmany of the doctrines of Luther, believed that Luther was inclined to\r\nlay too much stress on faith and external organisation to the\r\nexclusion of real religion. He thought that more attention should be\r\npaid to the mystical and devotional element, in other words to the\r\npersonal union of the individual soul with God. According to him, this\r\nshould be the beginning and end of all religion, and if it could be\r\naccomplished organisation and dogma were to be treated as of secondary\r\nimportance. He rejected infant baptism, regarded the sacraments as\r\nmere symbols, denied the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and\r\nmaintained that in the Incarnation the human nature of Christ was in a\r\nsense deified. Schwenkfeld held several interviews with Luther in the\r\nhope of winning him over to his opinions but without success. Owing to\r\nhis quarrel with the master, Schwenkfeld was banished from Strassburg\r\nin 1533, and condemned by a Lutheran assembly at Schmalkald in 1540.\r\nHis doctrines found considerable support in Silesia and in the states\r\nof several German princes, though it was only after Schwenkfeld's\r\ndeath that his followers began to organise themselves into separate\r\ncommunities. Owing to persecution many of them fled to America where\r\nthey settled in Pennsylvania (1634). In 1742 the sect was tolerated in\r\nPrussia.\r\n\r\n/Socinianism/.[9]--The doctrine of the Blessed Trinity found many\r\nopponents in Latin countries about the time of the Reformation.\r\nMichael Servetus, Gentilis, Campanus, and Blandrata, attacked the\r\nTrinity from different points of view, but by far the most dangerous\r\nadversaries of the doctrine were Laelius Socinus (1525-1562) and his\r\nnephew Faustus Socinus (1539-1604). The former of these became a\r\nmember of a secret society founded at Vicenza (1546) for the\r\ndiscussion and propagation of anti-Trinitarian views (1546). The\r\nprincipal members of this body were Gentilis, Blandrata, Alciatus, and\r\nLaelius Socinus, a priest of Siena and a man who stood in close\r\nrelationship with some of the leading Lutherans and Calvinists. When\r\nthe society at Vicenza was suppressed several of the prominent members\r\nfled to Poland for asylum. Laelius Socinus, though he remained at\r\nZurich, was looked up to as the guiding spirit of the party till his\r\ndeath in 1562. His nephew Faustus Socinus then stepped into the place\r\nvacated by his uncle. The anti-Trinitarians in Poland, who had begun\r\nto style themselves Unitarians since 1563, had established themselves\r\nat Racow. In 1579 Faustus Socinus arrived in Poland, at a time when\r\nthe anti-Trinitarians were divided into opposing factions, but in a\r\nshort while he succeeded in winning most of them over to his own\r\nviews. The doctrines of Socinus and of his principal disciples were\r\nexplained in the /Catechism of Racow/ (first published in 1605) and in\r\nthe numerous theological works of Socinus. In 1638 the Socinians were\r\nbanished from Poland, and violent measures were taken against them by\r\nmost of the Catholic and Protestant princes of Europe.\r\n\r\nThough Socinus professed the greatest respect for the Sacred\r\nScriptures as the one and only source of all religion, he claimed the\r\nright of free interpretation even to the extent of rejecting anything\r\nin them that surpassed the powers of human understanding. In this\r\nrespect he was as much a rationalist as any of the extreme\r\nrationalists who fought against Christianity in the eighteenth\r\ncentury. God, he maintained, was absolutely simple and therefore there\r\ncould be no Trinity; He was infinite, and therefore could not unite\r\nHimself with human nature, as was assumed in the doctrine of the\r\nIncarnation; the Holy Ghost was not a person distinct from the Father,\r\nbut only the energy and power of the Father as manifested in the\r\nsanctification of souls. Christ was not God; He was merely the Logos\r\nborn miraculously and deputed by God to be a mediator for men. He\r\nascended into Heaven, where He was in some sense deified and endowed\r\nwith supreme dominion over the universe. Hence in opposition to the\r\nUnitarians Socinus maintained that Christ should be worshipped as God.\r\nHe died on the cross according to the command of the Father, but it\r\nwas by His example of obedience and by His preaching rather than by\r\nthe vicarious sacrifice of His life that man's redemption was\r\neffected. The work of redemption which Christ began on earth is\r\ncontinued in Heaven through His intercession with the Father. From\r\nthis notion of the redemption it followed as a logical consequence\r\nthat the sacraments could not be regarded as channels of grace or as\r\nanything more than external signs of union with the Christian body.\r\nThe Socinian doctrine was condemned by Paul IV.[10] (1555) and by\r\nClement VIII. (1603).\r\n\r\n/Pietism/.[11]--This movement among the Lutherans resembled closely\r\nsome of the developments of Mysticism in the Catholic Church during\r\nthe fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Its object was to direct\r\nattention to the spiritual and ethical side of religion regardless of\r\ndogma and external organisation. One of its greatest leaders was\r\nSpener,[12] a student at Geneva, and later on a preacher at Frankfurt.\r\nIn his endeavours to bring religion to bear on the daily lives of the\r\npeople and to awaken in them a sense of their personal relations to\r\nGod he founded the /Collegia Pietatis/, private assemblies for the\r\nstudy of the Scriptures, for the discussion of the means of\r\nredemption, and for a general revival of religious zeal. With the same\r\nobject in view he wrote the /Pia Desideria/ (1567), which was much\r\nprized as a spiritual reading book by the devout Lutherans of Germany.\r\nHe emphasised the idea of a universal priesthood, which he thought had\r\nbeen somewhat neglected by the leaders of the Lutherans, advocated for\r\nthose who were destined for the ministry a training in spiritual life\r\nrather than in theological lore, encouraged good works as the best\r\nmeans of securing eternal bliss, objected to polemical discussions,\r\nand welcomed the establishments of private societies for the promotion\r\nof Christian perfection. About the same time Franke and Anton\r\nundertook a similar work in Leipzig by founding the /Collegium\r\nPhilobiblicum/ principally for students and members of the university.\r\nThis society was suppressed at the instigation of the Lutheran faculty\r\nof theology, and the two founders of it were dismissed. In a short\r\ntime Spener was appointed to an office in Berlin and was received with\r\ngreat favour at the court. By his influence three of his leading\r\ndisciples, Franke, Anton, and Breithaupt were appointed professors in\r\nthe University of Halle, which from that time became the leading\r\ncentre of Pietism in Germany. Students flocked to Halle from all parts\r\nof Germany, from Denmark, and from Switzerland. An attempt was made to\r\nexplain away Luther's teaching on good works, and to insist on the\r\npractical as distinct from the intellectual aspect of Christianity.\r\nThis relegation of dogma to a secondary place, and the establishment\r\nof private assemblies to supplant the ecclesiastical organisation and\r\nthe established liturgy, led to the development of separatist\r\ntendencies and ultimately to the promotion of dogmatic indifference.\r\nIt is a noteworthy fact that Semler was one of the students most\r\nsincerely attached to Pietism at Halle.\r\n\r\n/Herrnhuters/.[13]--This sect was only a development of the Moravian\r\nBrothers founded in 1457 by one of the Hussite leaders. It owes its\r\ndevelopment in the eighteenth century to Count Zinzendorf (1700-1760),\r\na wealthy nobleman and a Pietist of the school of Spener. A number of\r\nthe Moravian or Bohemian Brethren having appealed to him for a\r\nsuitable place to establish a settlement, he offered them portion of\r\nhis estate at Hutberg (1722). As they were inclined to quarrel amongst\r\nthemselves he undertook in person the work of organisation. He\r\nappointed a college of elders to control the spiritual and temporal\r\naffairs of the community, together with a college of deacons to\r\nsuperintend specially the temporal wants of the brethren. Like the\r\nPietists generally he paid little attention to dogmatic differences,\r\nallowing the Lutherans, Calvinists, and Moravians to have their own\r\nseparate elders. As he was anxious to undertake missionary work he\r\nreceived Holy Orders, and wished to preach in Bohemia, but the\r\nAustrian government refused to allow him to continue his work in that\r\nprovince, and even secured his banishment from Saxony. He went through\r\nEurope visiting Holland and England and established some of his\r\ncommunities in both these countries, after which he returned to\r\nHerrnhut in 1755. During his lifetime Zinzendorf was looked upon as\r\nthe head of the whole community, but after his death it was much more\r\ndifficult to preserve unity. The Herrnhuters made some progress in\r\nGermany, but their greatest strength at the present day is to be found\r\nin England and the United States.\r\n\r\n/Swedenborgians/.[14]--The founder of this sect was Emanuel Swedenborg\r\n(1688-1772), who was born at Stockholm, and educated at the University\r\nof Upsala. He was a very distinguished student especially in the\r\ndepartment of mathematics and physical science, and after an extended\r\ntour through Germany, France, Holland, and England he returned and\r\nsettled down in Sweden, where he was offered and refused a chair at\r\nUpsala. From 1734 he began to turn to the study of philosophy and\r\nreligion. After 1743, when he declared that Our Lord had appeared to\r\nhim in a vision, had taught him the real spiritual sense of Scripture,\r\nand had commanded him to instruct others, he abandoned his\r\nmathematical pursuits and turned entirely to religion. As Judaism had\r\nbeen supplanted by Christianity, so too, he maintained, the revelation\r\ngiven by Christ was to be perfected by that granted to himself. He\r\nrejected the Justification theory of Luther, the Predestination\r\nteaching of Calvin, the doctrines of the Trinity, of Original Sin, and\r\nof the Resurrection of the body. The one God, according to him, took\r\nto Himself human flesh, and the name, Son of God, was applied properly\r\nto the humanity assumed by God the Father, while the Holy Ghost was\r\nbut the energy and operation of the God Man. The new Jerusalem, that\r\nwas to take the place of the Christian Church, was to be initiated on\r\nthe day he completed his great work /Vera Christiana Religio/ (1770).\r\nHe claimed that the last Judgment took place in his presence in 1757.\r\nDuring his own life he did little to organise his followers except by\r\nestablishing small societies for the study of the Bible, but after his\r\ndeath the organisation of the new Jerusalem was pushed on rapidly.\r\nFrom Sweden the sect spread into England, where the first community\r\nwas established in Lancashire in 1787, and into America and Germany.\r\nFor a long time the Swedenborgians were persecuted as heretics in\r\nSweden.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] Kawerau, /J.

The\r\nPeace of Westphalia (1648), by giving official sanction to the\r\nprinciple of state neutrality, meant nothing less than a complete\r\nrevolution in the relations that had existed hitherto between Church\r\nand State. So long as the Christian world was united in one great\r\nreligious family, acknowledging the Pope as the common Father of\r\nChristendom, it was not strange that in disputes between princes and\r\nsubjects or between the rulers of independent states the authority of\r\nthe Pope as supreme arbitrator should have been recognised, or that\r\nhis interference even in temporal matters should not have been\r\nregarded as unwarrantable.\r\n\r\nBut once the religious unity of Europe was broken by the separation of\r\nentire nations from the Church, and once the politico-religious\r\nconstitution of the Holy Roman Empire was destroyed by the acceptance\r\nof the principle of religious neutrality, the Popes felt that their\r\ninterference even indirectly in temporal matters, however justifiable\r\nit might be in itself, could produce no good results. Hence apart from\r\ntheir action as temporal sovereigns of the Papal States, a position\r\nthat obliged the Popes to take part in political affairs, the whole\r\ntendency was to confine themselves strictly to spiritual matters, and\r\nto preserve harmony if possible between Church and State. This policy\r\ndid not, however, satisfy the selfish designs of rulers, who had\r\ndetermined to crush all representative institutions and to assert for\r\nthemselves complete and unlimited authority. Catholic rulers, jealous\r\nof the increased powers secured by Protestant princes through the\r\nexercise of supreme ecclesiastical jurisdiction, determined to assert\r\nfor themselves a somewhat similar authority over the Catholic Church\r\nin their own territories. It was no longer the supposed inroads of the\r\nChurch upon the domain of the State but the attacks of the State upon\r\nthe rights of the Church, that were likely to disturb the good\r\nrelations between Catholic princes and the Pope. These rulers demanded\r\nan overwhelming voice in all ecclesiastical appointments; they\r\ninsisted upon exercising the /Royal Placet/ upon papal documents and\r\nepiscopal pronouncements; they would tolerate no longer the privileges\r\nand exemptions admitted by their predecessors in favour of clerics or\r\nof ecclesiastical property; they claimed the right of dictating to the\r\ncardinals who should be Pope and of dictating to the Pope who should\r\nbe cardinals; of controlling education in their own dominions; of\r\ndetermining the laws and rules concerning marriages and matrimonial\r\ndispensations, and of fixing the constitutions of those religious\r\norders the existence of which they were willing to tolerate.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately in their designs for transferring ecclesiastical\r\njurisdiction from the Popes to the crown the princes were favoured by\r\nmany of the bishops, who were annoyed at the continual interference of\r\nRome and who failed to realise that the king was a much greater danger\r\nto their independence than the Pope; by a large body of clerics and\r\nlaymen, who looked to the civil authority for promotion; by the\r\nJansenists who detested Rome, because Rome had barred the way against\r\nthe speculative and practical religious revolution which they\r\ncontemplated; by the philosophers and rationalists, many of whom,\r\nthough enemies of absolute rule, did not fail to recognise that\r\ndisputes between Church and State, leading necessarily to a weakening\r\nof Church authority, meant the weakening of dogmatic Christianity; and\r\nby liberal-minded Catholics of the /Aufklarung/ school, who thought\r\nthat every blow dealt at Rome meant a blow struck for the policy of\r\nmodernising the discipline, government, and faith of the Church. The\r\neighteenth century was a period of transition from the politico-\r\nreligious views of the Middle Ages to those of modern times. It was a\r\nperiod of conflict between two ideas of the relations that should\r\nexist between Church and State. The Popes were called upon to defend\r\nnot indeed their right to interfere in temporal matters, for of that\r\nthere was no question, but their right to exercise control in purely\r\nspiritual affairs. It is necessary to bear this in mind if one wishes\r\nto appreciate the policy of those, upon whom was placed the terrible\r\nresponsibility of governing the Church during the one hundred and\r\nfifty years that elapsed between the Peace of Westphalia and the\r\noutbreak of the French Revolution.\r\n\r\nIn the conclave that followed the death of Innocent X., Cardinal\r\nChigi, who had been nuncio at Cologne, envoy-extraordinary of the Holy\r\nSee during the negotiations that ended in the Peace of Westphalia, and\r\nafterwards Secretary of State, was elected, and took the title of\r\nAlexander VII.[1] (1655-67). At first the people were rejoiced because\r\nthe new Pope had shown himself so determined an opponent of that\r\nnepotism, which had dimmed the glory of so many of his predecessors,\r\nbut at the request of the foreign ambassadors and with the approval of\r\nthe cardinals he changed his policy after some time, brought some of\r\nhis relatives to Rome, and allowed them too much influence. His\r\nelection had been opposed by Cardinal Mazarin in the name of France,\r\nand throughout his reign he was doomed to suffer severely from the\r\nunfriendly and high-handed action of Louis XIV., who despatched an\r\narmy to the Papal States to revenge an insult to his ambassador, the\r\nDuc de Crequi, and forced the Pope to sign the disgraceful Peace of\r\nPisa (1664). Alexander VII. condemned the Jansenistic distinction\r\nbetween law and fact by the Bull, /Ad Sanctam Petri Sedem/ (1665), to\r\nenforce which he drew up a formulary of faith to be signed by the\r\nFrench clergy and religious. He observed an attitude of neutrality in\r\nthe disputes between Spain and Portugal, secured the return of the\r\nJesuits to Venice, and welcomed to Rome Queen Christina of Sweden, who\r\nabandoned Lutheranism to return to the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\nHis successor, Cardinal Rospigliosi, formerly nuncio at Madrid and\r\nSecretary of State was proclaimed Pope as Clement IX. (1667-69). He\r\nwas deeply religious, generous in his donations to the poor and to\r\nhospitals, and uninfluenced by any undue attachment to his relations.\r\nHe put an end to the religious disorders that had reigned in Portugal\r\nsince 1648, when that country seceded from Spain to which it had been\r\nunited since 1580, and proclaimed the Duke of Braganza king under the\r\ntitle of John IV. Matters had reached such a crisis that many of the\r\nbishoprics in Portugal and the Portuguese colonies were left vacant.\r\nIn 1668 after the conclusion of the Peace of Lisbon the Pope appointed\r\nthose who had been nominated to the vacant Sees. Deceived by the false\r\nrepresentations made to him from France, he restored the French\r\nbishops who had adhered publicly to the distinction between law and\r\nfact. He offered generous assistance to Venice more especially in its\r\ndefence of Crete against the Turks. During his reign he canonised Mary\r\nMagdalen de Pazzi, and Peter of Alcantara.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Clement IX. the cardinals could not at first agree\r\nupon any candidate, but finally as a compromise they elected, much\r\nagainst his own will, Cardinal Altieri, then an old man eighty years\r\nof age.[2] He was proclaimed as Clement X. (1670-76). Unable to\r\ntransact much business himself he left too much in the hands of\r\nothers, especially to Cardinal Paoluzzi. He encouraged and assisted\r\nthe Poles in their struggles against the Turks, and resisted the\r\ndemands of Louis XIV. concerning the /Regalia/. He canonised John\r\nCajetan, Philip Benitius, Francis Borgia, Louis Bertrand, and Rose of\r\nLima.\r\n\r\nIn the conclave that followed the demise of Clement X. Cardinal\r\nOdescalchi, against whom France had exercised the veto on a previous\r\noccasion, was elected and took the name of Innocent XI.[3] (1676-\r\n1689). He was zealous for religion, charitable to the poor, economic\r\nand prudent in the administration of the Papal States, anxious for an\r\nimprovement in clerical education, and a strong opponent of everything\r\nthat savoured of nepotism. His whole reign was troubled by the\r\ninsolent and overbearing demands of Louis XIV. in regard to the\r\n/Regalia/, the right of asylum, and the Declaration of the French\r\nClergy (1682), but Innocent XI. maintained a firm attitude in spite of\r\nthe threats of the king and the culpable weakness of the French\r\nbishops. He encouraged John Sobieski, King of Poland, to take up arms\r\nagainst the Turks who had laid siege to Vienna, and contributed\r\ngenerously to help Hungary to withstand these invaders.\r\n\r\nAfter the short and by no means glorious reign of Alexander VIII.\r\n(Cardinal Ottoboni, 1689-91), the cardinals were divided into two\r\nparties, the French and the Spanish-Austrian. When the conclave had\r\ncontinued five months without any result they agreed finally to elect\r\na compromise candidate (Cardinal Pignatelli) who took the name of\r\nInnocent XII. (1691-1700). In every respect he showed himself worthy\r\nof his holy office. Nepotism was condemned in the Bull /Romanum Decet\r\nPontificum/, better arrangements were made for the administration of\r\njustice throughout the Papal States; the disputes with Louis XIV.\r\nregarding the Declaration of the French Clergy were settled when the\r\nbishops who signed these articles expressed their regret for their\r\nconduct (1693); and several propositions taken from the /Maximes/ of\r\nFenelon were condemned. The Pope was involved in a serious dispute\r\nwith the Emperor Leopold I. concerning the right of asylum attached to\r\nthe imperial embassy in Rome, and the aggressive policy of Martinitz,\r\nthe imperial ambassador. As a result of this quarrel the Pope, without\r\nconsulting Charles II. of Spain who had no heirs, favoured the\r\npretensions of Philip Duke of Anjou (Philip V.) to the throne of Spain\r\nin preference to the Emperor's son the Archduke Charles.\r\n\r\nIn the conclave that assembled after the death of Innocent XII. the\r\nmajority of the cardinals favoured Cardinal Mariscotti, but, as his\r\nelection was vetoed by France, they concentrated their votes on\r\nCardinal Albani. For three days he refused to accept the onerous\r\noffice, but at last he gave way to the earnest entreaties of the\r\ncardinals, and allowed himself to be proclaimed as Clement XI.[4]\r\n(1700-21). His election was acclaimed in Rome, in Italy, and\r\nthroughout the Catholic world. He was a man of great sanctity of life,\r\ndevoted to prayer and labour, who set an example to others by\r\npreaching and hearing confessions regularly in St. Peter's. While he\r\nwas Pope there was no danger of nepotism at the papal court, and no\r\nprospect for unworthy or greedy officials in the Papal States. During\r\nhis entire reign he was involved in disputes with the Catholic powers.\r\nThe death of Charles II. of Spain led to a conflict between Louis\r\nXIV., who claimed the crown for his grandson Philip of Anjou (Philip\r\nV.), and the Emperor Leopold I., who supported the cause of his son,\r\nthe Archduke, Charles III. Clement XI. endeavoured at first to\r\nmaintain an attitude of neutrality, but as Philip had been crowned and\r\nhad established himself apparently on the throne of Spain the Pope was\r\nobliged to acknowledge him. This action gave great offence to Leopold\r\nI. and to his successor, Joseph I., who retaliated by interfering in\r\necclesiastical affairs and by despatching an army against the Papal\r\nStates. Clement XI., abandoned by Louis XIV. and by Philip V. was\r\nobliged to come to terms with the Emperor, and to acknowledge Charles\r\nIII. as king of Spain. Immediately Louis XIV. and Philip V. were up in\r\narms against the Pope. The nuncio was dismissed from Madrid and\r\nrelations between Spain and Rome were interrupted for a long period;\r\nthe papal representatives were excluded from the negotiations\r\npreceding the Peace of Utrecht (1713); and feudal territories of the\r\nHoly See were disposed of without consulting the wishes of the Pope,\r\nSicily being handed over to Victor Amadeus of Savoy (1675-1713) with\r\nwhom Clement XI. was then in serious conflict.\r\n\r\nTo put an end to difficulties with the foreign bishops, who exercised\r\njurisdiction in portion of his territory, the Duke of Savoy had\r\ndemanded full rights of nomination to episcopal Sees. When this demand\r\nwas refused he recalled his ambassador from Rome (1701), and took upon\r\nhimself the regulation of ecclesiastical affairs. He appointed an\r\nadministrator to take charge of the revenues of vacant Sees, enforced\r\nthe /Royal Placet/ on episcopal and papal documents, and forbade the\r\npublication of Roman censures (1710). A partial agreement was arrived\r\nat when the royal administrator consented to accept his appointment\r\nfrom the Pope, but the transference of Sicily to the Duke of Savoy led\r\nto a new and more serious quarrel. The latter attempted to revive the\r\nprivileges known as the Sicilian Monarchy, accorded formerly to the\r\nruler of Sicily. The Pope refused to recognise these claims, and as\r\nthe king remained stubborn nothing was left but to place the island\r\nunder interdict. To this the king replied by expelling those priests\r\nwho observed the interdict. This state of affairs lasted until Sicily\r\npassed into the hands of the King of Spain (1718).\r\n\r\nThe Turks were active once more and threatened Europe by land and sea.\r\nClement XI. sent generous supplies to Venice to equip its fleet,\r\nencouraged Stanislaus Augustus of Poland who had joined the Catholic\r\nChurch, granted tithes upon ecclesiastical property to help him in the\r\nstruggle, and allowed Philip V. of Spain portion of the revenues\r\nderived from the benefices in Spain and in the Spanish-American\r\ncolonies, on condition that the Spanish fleet should be sent into the\r\nMediterranean to take part in the war against Turkey. The victories of\r\nPrince Eugene (1716-18) dealt a severe blow to the power of the\r\nSultan, but the Spanish fleet instead of assisting the Christian\r\nforces was used for the capture of Sardinia from the Emperor. As\r\nevidence of the difficult position of Clement XI. in face of the\r\npowers of Europe it is sufficient to point to the fact that at one\r\ntime or another during his reign, his nuncios were driven from Vienna,\r\nTurin, Madrid, and Naples.\r\n\r\nThe conclave that followed was, as might be expected, a stormy one;\r\nbut in the end Cardinal Conti, who had been nuncio in Lucerne and\r\nLisbon, was elected and took as his title Innocent XIII. (1721-24). He\r\ngranted the kingdom of Naples to the Emperor, who in turn without\r\nconsulting the Pope bestowed the papal fiefs of Parma and Piacenza on\r\nPrince Charles of France. Peace was restored between the Holy See and\r\nSpain (1723), and Innocent XIII., yielding very unwillingly to the\r\nimportunate demands of France, conferred a cardinal's hat on Dubois,\r\nthe prime minister.\r\n\r\nHis successor was Benedict XIII. (1724-30). Cardinal Orsini, as he was\r\nknown before his election, belonged to the Dominican Order, and at the\r\ntime of the conclave held the Archbishopric of Benevento. As\r\narchbishop he was most zealous in the administration of his diocese,\r\nand as Pope he followed the same strict simple life to which he had\r\nbeen accustomed when a Dominican friar. He made peace with the Emperor\r\nby granting him practically all the rights contained in the Sicilian\r\nMonarchy, reserving to the Holy See only the final decision of\r\nimportant cases (1728), and with the King of Savoy by acknowledging\r\nhis title over Sardinia and by granting him the right of episcopal\r\nnomination in the island. With the demand of King John of Portugal,\r\nnamely, that Portugal should enjoy the privilege of presenting\r\ncandidates for appointment to the college of cardinals, Benedict XIII.\r\nrefused to comply, and as a consequence the Portuguese ambassador was\r\nrecalled from Rome and communications with the Holy See were\r\ninterrupted. The extension of the feast of Gregory VII. (Hildebrand)\r\nto the whole Church gave great offence to many rulers both Catholic\r\nand Protestant, because such a step was interpreted as a direct\r\nchallenge to the new theories of secular intervention in\r\necclesiastical affairs. Benedict XIII. was a saintly ruler, whose only\r\nmisfortune was that he relied too much on unworthy councillors like\r\nCardinal Coscia and Cardinal Lercari, who deceived him in their\r\nnegotiations with the governments of Europe and in the administration\r\nof the Papal States. A rebellion against these men broke out in Rome\r\nwhen the news of the Pope's death became public. Cardinal Coscia was\r\ndeprived of his dignity and imprisoned, while many of his associates\r\nand subordinates were punished no less severely.\r\n\r\nCardinal Corsini who succeeded as Clement XII. (1730-1740) was faced\r\nwith a very difficult situation in Rome and in the Papal States. The\r\ntreasury was empty, the finances were in disorder, and the discontent\r\nwas general. The Pope, though very old, delicate, and almost\r\ncompletely blind, showed wonderful energy and administrative ability.\r\nThe financial affairs of the government were placed upon a proper\r\nfooting. Instead of a deficit there was soon a surplus, which was\r\nexpended in beautifying the city, in opening up the port of Ancona,\r\nand in the drainage and reclamation of the marshes. Like his\r\npredecessors, Clement XII. had much to suffer from the Catholic rulers\r\nof Europe. He was engaged in a quarrel with the King of Savoy because\r\nhe tried to limit the privileges that had been conceded to this\r\nsovereign by his predecessor. Philip V. of Spain demanded that the\r\nPope should confer a cardinal's hat together with the Archbishoprics\r\nof Seville and Toledo on his son, then only nine years of age. The\r\nPope endeavoured to satisfy the king by granting the temporal\r\nadministration of Toledo until the boy should reach the canonical age\r\nfor the reception of Orders (1735), but owing to an attack made upon\r\nthe Spanish ambassador in Rome during a popular commotion the courts\r\nof Naples and Madrid dismissed the papal ambassador and broke off\r\nrelations with the Holy See. Peace, however, was restored with Spain\r\nin 1737, and with Naples in the following year. Clement XII. condemned\r\nthe Freemasons (1738). He canonised Vincent de Paul, John Francis\r\nRegis, and Juliana Falconieri.\r\n\r\nThe conclave that followed lasted six months before any of the\r\ncandidates could secure the required majority. At last Cardinal\r\nLambertini was elected and proclaimed under the title of Benedict\r\nXIV.[5] (1740-58). In many particulars, but more especially as a\r\nscholar and a writer, he may be regarded as one of the greatest Popes\r\nof modern times. He was born in 1675, was educated at Rome and\r\nBologna, and even as a very young man he was looked upon as a leading\r\nauthority on canon law and theology. He rose steadily from position to\r\nposition in Rome till at last he found himself cardinal and Archbishop\r\nof Bologna. As archbishop he was most successful in the discharge of\r\nall the duties that appertained to his office. He held diocesan synods\r\nregularly, visited the most distant parishes of his diocese,\r\nsuperintended the education of his clerical students for whom he drew\r\nup a new plan of studies, and above all he strove to maintain most\r\nfriendly relations with both priests and people. But notwithstanding\r\nhis cares of office he found time to continue his studies, and to\r\nprepare learned volumes on Canon Law, Theology, and History, that\r\nplaced him amongst the leading scholars of his time.\r\n\r\nNor did he change his policy or his course of life after his election\r\nto the papal throne. Benedict XIV. was convinced that a better\r\ntraining would help to strengthen the influence of the clergy, and\r\nwould enable them to combat more successfully the rising spirit of\r\nunbelief. Hence he was anxious to introduce into the colleges more\r\nmodern educational methods. He founded four academies, one for\r\nChristian Archaeology, one for Canon Law, one for Church History, and\r\none for the special study of the history of the Councils. He gave\r\nevery encouragement to priests who wished to devote themselves to\r\nliterary pursuits, and in his own person he showed how much could be\r\ndone in this direction without any neglect of duty. His instructions\r\nand encyclicals were learned treatises, in which no aspect of the\r\nsubject he handled was neglected. His decrees on marriage, especially\r\non mixed marriages (/Magnae Nobis admirationis/, 1748), on Penance,\r\nand on the Oriental Rites were of vital importance. Both before and\r\nafter his elevation to the papacy he published many learned works, the\r\nmost important of which were the /Institutiones Ecclesiasticae/, /De\r\nSynodo Diocesana/, /De Servorum Dei Beatificatione et de Beatorum\r\ncanonizatione/, /Thesaurus Resolutionum Sacrae Congregationis\r\nConcilii/, and the /Casus Conscientiae/.\r\n\r\nIn his administration of the Papal States Benedict XIV. was no less\r\nsuccessful. The enormous expenses incurred by his predecessor had\r\ndepleted the papal treasury, but the schemes of retrenchment enforced\r\nby Benedict XIV. produced such good results that in a few years money\r\nwas available for the development of agriculture, industries, and\r\ncommerce. With the civil rulers of Europe he had a difficult part to\r\nplay. Convinced that disputes between the civil and ecclesiastical\r\nauthority resulted only in promoting the schemes of the enemies of\r\nreligion, he was determined to go to the very limits of concession for\r\nthe sake of peace and harmony. For a time at least he was able to\r\nsecure a partial reconciliation, and had his overtures been met in the\r\nproper spirit a working arrangement might have been established, that\r\nwould have enabled both powers to combine against the forces at work\r\nfor the overthrow of Church and State.\r\n\r\nThe title of King of Prussia assumed by the Elector of Brandenburg was\r\nrecognised by the Pope; peace was made with Portugal by granting to\r\nthe crown rights of patronage over bishoprics and abbeys (1740), and\r\nto set the seal on this reconciliation the title of /Rex Fidelissimus/\r\nwas bestowed on the King of Portugal. With the court of Turin the Pope\r\nhad still greater difficulties, but an agreement was arrived at,\r\nwhereby the king was to have the right of nomination to ecclesiastical\r\nbenefices; the foreign bishops having jurisdiction in the territory of\r\nSavoy were to appoint vicars-general for the administration of these\r\nportions of their dioceses, and the administrator of vacant benefices\r\nappointed by the king was to act as the deputy of the Pope (1741).\r\nWith Spain a formal concordat was concluded in 1753. The dispute in\r\nNaples regarding the Sicilian Monarchy was settled by the appointment\r\nof a mixed tribunal composed of laymen and clerics, presided over by a\r\ncleric for the settlement of ecclesiastical affairs. The Pope's\r\ndecision that only those who refused publicly to accept the papal\r\ncondemnation of Jansenism were to be excluded from the sacraments\r\nhelped to ease considerably the situation in France. He condemned the\r\nFreemasons (1751), and reduced the number of holidays for Spain in\r\n1742 and for Austria, Tuscany, and Naples in 1748.\r\n\r\nHis successor Clement XIII. (1758-69) found himself in a peculiarly\r\nunhappy position. Despite the friendly policy adopted by Benedict XIV.\r\ntowards the civil rulers, or, as some would say, as a result of the\r\nconcessions that he made, their demands became still more exorbitant.\r\nThe Rationalists, liberal Catholics, Jansenists, and Freemasons united\r\ntheir forces for a grand attack upon the Society of Jesus, the\r\nsuppression of which they were determined to secure. Already rumblings\r\nof the storm had been heard before the death of Benedict XIV. His\r\nsuccessor, who had the highest admiration for the Jesuits, stood\r\nmanfully by the Society, and refused to yield to the threats of the\r\nBourbon rulers thirsting for its destruction. His sudden death was\r\nattributed not without good reason to the ultimatum, demanding the\r\nimmediate suppression of the Jesuits, addressed to him by the\r\nambassadors of France, Spain, and Naples.\r\n\r\nIn the conclave the cardinals were divided into two parties, the\r\n/Zelanti/ who stood for resistance to the demands of the civil rulers,\r\nand the moderate men who supported the policy of conciliation. The\r\nrepresentatives of France, Spain, Portugal, and Naples, left no stone\r\nunturned to prevent the election of a /Zelanti/, and the veto was used\r\nwith such effect that the choice of the cardinals was at last limited\r\nto only three or four. Threats were made that, if a candidate was\r\nelected against the wishes of the Bourbons, Rome might be occupied by\r\nforeign troops, and obedience might be refused to the new Pope. In the\r\nend a Franciscan friar, Cardinal Ganganelli, who was not an extreme\r\npartisan of either party among the cardinals, received the required\r\nmajority of votes, and was proclaimed as Clement XIV. (1769-74). The\r\nnew Pope was not unfriendly to the Jesuits, nor had he any evidence\r\nthat could induce him to reverse the very favourable judgment\r\ndelivered in their favour by his immediate predecessor. He endeavoured\r\nto avert the storm by making generous concessions to the Bourbons and\r\nto Portugal, by adopting an unfriendly attitude towards the Society,\r\nand by offering to effect serious changes in its constitution. But\r\nthese half-way measures failed to put an end to the agitation, and at\r\nlast Clement XIV. found himself obliged to make his choice between\r\nsuppression and schism. In the circumstances he thought it best for\r\nthe sake of peace to sacrifice the Society (1773) but he was soon to\r\nrealise that peace could not be procured even by such a sacrifice. His\r\nweakness led only to more intolerable demands from France, Spain and\r\nNaples.\r\n\r\nThe cardinals assembled in conclave after his death found it difficult\r\nto agree upon any candidate, but finally after a conclave lasting more\r\nthan four months they elected Cardinal Braschi, who took the title of\r\nPius VI.[6] (1775-99). The new Pope was a zealous ecclesiastic,\r\nanxious to promote a policy of conciliation, but immovable as a rock\r\nwhen there was a question of the essential rights of the Church. He\r\nwithstood manfully the Febronian policy of Joseph II. and of the\r\nprince-bishops of Germany, and condemned the decrees of the Synod of\r\nPistoia (1794). He endeavoured to maintain friendly relations with\r\nPortugal, Spain, Naples, and Sardinia, though the old policy of state\r\nsupremacy was still the guiding principle of the rulers and\r\npoliticians. The storm that had been gathering for years broke over\r\nEurope during the latter years of his reign; the Bourbon throne in\r\nFrance was overturned, and no man could foretell when a similar fate\r\nawaited the other royal families of Europe. Pius VI., though not\r\nunwilling to recognise the new order, was stern in his refusal to\r\npermit the constitution of the Church to be changed. For this reason\r\nhis capital was occupied; his cardinals were dispersed, and he himself\r\nwas brought as a prisoner to Valence, where he died in exile (1799).\r\nThe enemies of religion could not conceal their delight. They declared\r\ntriumphantly that with him the long line of Peter had ceased to exist,\r\nbut the conclave at Venice and the election of Pius VII. (1800) soon\r\nshowed the world that though kingdoms and dynasties might disappear\r\nthe Papacy still survived, as Christ had foretold it should survive.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] Pallavicini, /Vita de Alessandro VII./, 1849.\r\n\r\n[2] De Bildt, /The Conclave of Clement X./, 1905.\r\n\r\n[3] Bonamici, /Da Vita Innocenti XI./, 1776.\r\n\r\n[4] Lafiteau, /Vie de Clement XI./, 1752.\r\n\r\n[5] /Benedicti XIV.

Except in the\r\nfield of ecclesiastical history and of historical theology the whole\r\ntendency was downwards.\r\n\r\nThe principal causes that paved the way for this universal decline\r\nwere the spread of Gallicanism and Jansenism with the consequent waste\r\nof energy to which these controversies led, the state of lethargy\r\nproduced by the enslavement of the Church, the withdrawal of\r\necclesiastical students, the suppression of the Society of Jesus, and\r\nthe rejection of the Scholastic system of philosophy in favour of the\r\nvagaries of Descartes or of the Leibniz-Wolf school in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe rise of the Rationalist school in France, threatening as it did\r\nthe very foundations of Christianity, called for the activity of a new\r\ngroup of apologists, who would do for Christianity in the eighteenth\r\ncentury what had been done for it against the pagan philosophers of\r\nold by men like Justin Martyr and Lactantius. Unfortunately, however,\r\nthough many able works were produced at the time, few if any of them\r\ncould lay claim to the literary charms or vigour of expression that\r\ncharacterised the works of the enemies of religion. The principal\r\napologists in France at this period were /Huet/ (d. 1721), /Sommier/\r\n(d. 1737), the Oratorian /Houteville/ (d. 1742), /Baltius, S.J./ (d.\r\n1743), /Bullet/, professor in the University of Besancon (d. 1775),\r\n/Bergier/, one of the most distinguished of Bullet's pupils (d. 1790),\r\n/Guenee/ (d. 1803), the able opponent of Voltaire, and /Feller, S.J./\r\n(d. 1802), whose /Catechisme philosophique/ and /Dictionnaire\r\nHistorique/ enjoyed a widespread popularity long after the writer had\r\npassed away.\r\n\r\nIn dogmatic theology the leading representatives of the Thomistic\r\nschool were without doubt /Vincent Louis Gotti/ (1664-1742) and\r\n/Charles Rene Billuart/ (1685-1757). The former of these was born at\r\nBologna, entered the Dominican novitiate at an early age, was the\r\nauthor of several polemical works directed against the Lutherans and\r\nCalvinists, and was created cardinal (1728). On account of his\r\nability, prudence, and sanctity of life he exercised a wonderful\r\ninfluence both within and without his order in France, so much so that\r\nin the conclave of 1740 his election to the papacy was favoured by a\r\nlarge body of his colleagues. Cardinal Gotti's greatest work was his\r\ncommentary on St. Thomas, entitled /Theologia Scholastico-Dogmatica\r\niuxta mentem D. Thomae/ (1727-1735). /Billuart/ was born at Ardennes\r\nin Belgium, and on the completion of his classical studies he became a\r\nnovice in the Dominican convent at Lille. For the years during which\r\nhe held several positions in Dominican houses in Belgium his abilities\r\nas a writer, professor, and preacher, attracted so much attention that\r\non the petition of Billuart's colleagues at Douay, the general of the\r\norder decided to entrust him with the work of preparing an exhaustive\r\nand authoritative commentary on the /Summa/ of Saint Thomas. After\r\nfive years hard work the edition was completed and was published at\r\nLiege in nineteen volumes[1] (1746-51). A compendium was issued in\r\n1754.\r\n\r\nThe best known and ablest exponent of the theological system of Duns\r\nScotus was /Claude Frassen/ (1621-1711). He was born at Peronne,\r\njoined the Franciscans, and was sent to Paris, where he taught\r\ntheology for years. His great work is his /Scotus Academicus/, a\r\ncommentary or explanation of the theological system of Duns Scotus.\r\nBoth on account of its faithful exposition of the views of Scotus and\r\nof the excellent method and style in which it is composed this work\r\nenjoyed and enjoys a considerable reputation.[2] Of the theologians of\r\nthe Augustinian school the two best known were /Lorenzo Berti/ (1696-\r\n1766) whose /De Theologies Disciplinis/ (1739-45) led to an imputation\r\nof Jansenism, from which the author was cleared by the verdict of\r\nBenedict XIV., and /Cardinal Norris/ (1631-1704) for a long time\r\nprofessor of ecclesiastical history at the University of Padua,\r\nagainst whose books, /Historia Pelagiana/ and /Vindiciae Augustanae/,\r\na prohibition was levelled by the Spanish Inquisition, but reversed on\r\nappeal to Benedict XIV.\r\n\r\nThe endless controversies to which Jansenism gave rise had lowered the\r\nreputation of the Sorbonne. The greatest representative of this centre\r\nof theological learning at this period was /Honore Tournely/, the\r\nsteadfast opponent of Jansenism, whose /Praelectiones Theologicae/\r\n(1738-40) was regarded as one of the most important works of the time.\r\nIn the defence of the Holy See against the attacks of Febronius the\r\ngreatest writers were /Zaccaria/ (1714-95) who wrote voluminously on\r\ntheology, ecclesiastical history and canon law; /Alfonso Muzzarelli/\r\n(1749-1813), the Dominican, /Cardinal Orsi/ (1693-1761), and /Cardinal\r\nGerdil/ (1718-1802), whose election to the papacy on the death of Pius\r\nVI. was vetoed by the Emperor. The /Theologia Wirceburgenis/ published\r\nby the Jesuits of Wurzburg (1766-71) contained a complete and masterly\r\nsummary of the entire theological course.\r\n\r\nThough Billuart and many of his contemporaries, following in the\r\nfootsteps of St. Thomas, dealt with both dogmatic and moral theology,\r\nthe tendency to treat the latter as a distinct department and to give\r\nmore attention to what may be termed the casuistical side of moral\r\ntheology became more marked. To a certain extent, at least in manuals\r\nintended for the use of the clergy, such a method was rendered\r\nnecessary by the frequent and more comprehensive character of the\r\nconfessions. Yet it furnished some apparent justification for the\r\nonslaughts of the Jansenists, who thought that they detected in the\r\nnew method a degradation of theology, a divorce between religion and\r\ncasuistry, and a return to the unholy hair-splitting of the Pharisees.\r\n\r\nClosely allied with the opposition to the new method adopted by the\r\nmoral theologians was the controversy on Probabilism, that divided the\r\nschools during the greater part of the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies. In the practical solution of doubtful obligations\r\nProbabilism had been applied for centuries, but it was only towards\r\nthe end of the sixteenth century that the principle was formulated\r\ndefinitely by the Dominican, De Medina. It was accepted immediately by\r\na great body of the Jesuits, as well as by nearly all writers on moral\r\ntheology. The Jansenists, however, in their eagerness to damage the\r\nreputation of their Jesuit opponents charged them with having\r\nintroduced this novel and lax system of morals with the object of\r\ncatering for the depraved tastes of their degenerate clients, and this\r\ncharge when presented in a popular and telling style by their\r\nopponents created a distinctly unfavourable impression against the\r\nSociety. The condemnation of Probabilism by the University of Louvain\r\n(1655) and the outcry raised against it by the Rigorist party led most\r\nof the religious orders and the secular clergy to abandon the system.\r\nTwo incidents that took place shortly afterwards helped to strengthen\r\nthe anti-Probabilist party. One of these was the condemnation by the\r\nHoly See of certain very lax principles put forward by some\r\ntheologians who labelled themselves Probabilists (1679), and the other\r\nwas the decision given by Innocent XI.[3] in the case of the defence\r\nof Probabiliorism written by Thyrsus Gonzalez (1624-1705) afterwards\r\ngeneral of the Jesuits. His superiors refused him permission to\r\npublish his work, and on appeal to the Pope this prohibition was\r\nremoved (1680). But though the Pope certainly favoured Probabiliorism\r\nit is not clear that his decision gave any practical sanction to this\r\nopinion. Rigorism was dealt a severe blow by the condemnation issued\r\nby Alexander VIII. (1690), and in the end the influence and writings\r\nof St. Alphonsus put an end to both extremes.\r\n\r\nAmongst the great theologians of the time were the Jesuit /Lacroix/\r\n(1652-1714), /Paul Gabriel Antoine, S.J./ (1679-1743) professor at the\r\nJesuit College of Pont-a-Mousson, /Billuart/ (1685-1757), /Eusebius\r\nAmort/ (1692-1775), and the /Salmanticenses/, the Jesuit authors of\r\nthe series on moral theology begun in Salamanca in 1665. But by far\r\nthe most remarkable writer on moral theology during the eighteenth\r\ncentury was /Saint Alphonsus de' Liguori/[4] (1697-1787), the founder\r\nof the Redemptorists. A saint, a scholar, and a practical missionary,\r\nwith a long and varied experience in the care of souls, he understood\r\nbetter than most of his contemporaries how to hold the scales fairly\r\nbetween laxity and rigorism. Though his views were attacked severely\r\nenough in his own time they found favour with the great body of\r\ntheologians and the approbation given to them by the Church helped to\r\nput an end to the rigorist opinions, that remained even after their\r\nJansenistic origin had been forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe spread of indifferentist or rationalist theories could not fail to\r\nweaken the reverence that had been inculcated by the early Reformers\r\nfor the Bible as the sole source of God's revelation to men. Acting\r\nupon Luther's principle of private judgment others, regardless of\r\ntheir inspiration and infallibility, undertook to subject the\r\nScriptures to the authority of human reason. Faustus Socinus (1539-\r\n1604), one of the founders of the Socinian sect, insisted that\r\neverything in the Scriptures that seems opposed to reason could not\r\nhave come from God and should be eliminated. For some time while\r\nreligious fervour was at its height both Lutherans and Calvinists held\r\nfast by their religious formularies and refused to accept the\r\nscriptural views of Socinus. But once dogmatic religion had been\r\nassailed by the new philosophico-rationalist school in England,\r\nGermany, and France the way was prepared for the acceptance of more\r\nliberal views. On the one hand, many of the extreme opponents of\r\nChristianity set themselves to point out the errors of the Bible, as a\r\nproof that it could not have come from God, while, on the other, many\r\nof the Protestant scholars, who still held by a divine Christian\r\nrevelation, endeavoured to eliminate from it the supernatural without\r\nrejecting openly the authority of the Scriptures.\r\n\r\nIt was with this design that Jacob Semler (1725-91) formulated the\r\nAccommodation Theory, according to which Christ and His Apostles\r\naccommodated their actions and their language to the erroneous notions\r\nprevalent among the Jews in their time, and for this reason all that\r\nbordered upon the mysterious should be regarded merely as a surrender\r\nto contemporary superstition. Another method of arriving at a similar\r\nconclusion was adopted by Kant, who maintained that the Bible was\r\nwritten only to inculcate morality and to strengthen man's moral\r\nsense, and that all that is recorded in it must be interpreted by\r\nreason in the light of the object which its authors had in view.\r\n\r\nWith such liberal theories about the authority and inspiration of the\r\nScriptures in the air it was almost impossible that the Catholic\r\nexegetists could escape the contagion. One of the ablest Catholic\r\nwriters at the time, the French Oratorian /Richard Simon/ (1638-1712),\r\nwas accused by his contemporaries of having approached too closely to\r\nthe rationalist system in his scriptural theories. He was a man well-\r\nversed in the Oriental languages and well able to appreciate the\r\nliterary and historical difficulties that might be urged against the\r\ninspiration and inerrancy of the Old Testament. He maintained that the\r\nBible was a literary production, and that, as such it should be\r\ninterpreted according to the ideas and methods of composition\r\nprevalent in the country or at the time in which the various books\r\nwere written. His views were contained in his /Histoire Critique de\r\nVieux Testament/ (1678) and his /Histoire Critique de Texte du Nouveau\r\nTestament/ (1689), both of which, though undoubtedly able works that\r\nhave considerably influenced scriptural study amongst Catholics since\r\nthat time, were severely criticised, and were condemned by the\r\nCongregation of the Index.\r\n\r\nAnother French Oratorian of the period, /Bernard Lamy/ (1640-1715),\r\ndealt with the introduction to the Scriptures in his two books\r\n/Apparatus ad Biblia Sacra/ (1687) and /Apparatus Biblicus/ (1696). As\r\na professor of philosophy Lamy had stirred up already a strong\r\nopposition owing to his evident leanings towards Cartesianism, nor was\r\nhe less unhappy in his scriptural studies. He questioned the\r\nhistorical character of the narrations contained in the books of\r\nTobias and Judith, and contended that notwithstanding the decrees of\r\nthe Council of Trent less authority should be attributed to the\r\nDeutero-Canonical than to the Proto-Canonical books of the Bible.\r\n\r\nAmongst the leading scriptural commentators were /Le Maistre de Saci/\r\n(d. 1684), a Jansenist, who published translations of the Old and the\r\nNew Testament, the latter of which was put upon the Index; /Piconio/\r\n(Henri Bernardine de Picquigny, 1633-1709) a Capuchin whose /Triplex\r\nExposito in Sacrosancta D.N. Jesu Christi Evangelia/ (1726), has not\r\nbeen surpassed till the present day; /Louis de Carrieres/ (1622-1717),\r\nwhose /La Sainte Bible en Francais avec un commentaire litteral/\r\nfounded on De Saci's translation was recognised as one of the simplest\r\nand best commentaries on the Scriptures; /Charles Francois Houbigant/\r\n(1686-1783), also an Oratorian, who published an edition of the Hebrew\r\nBible and the Greek text of the Deutero-Canonical books together with\r\na Prolegomena, and /Dom Calmet/ (1672-1757), a Benedictine, who\r\npublished in twenty-three volumes a commentary on the Old and New\r\nTestament accompanied by an introduction to the various books (1707-\r\n1716).\r\n\r\nIn no department of theological science were greater advances made\r\nduring the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries than in that of\r\necclesiastical history and historical theology. This was due largely\r\nto the labours and example of the Benedictines of St. Maur. Men like\r\n/Luc d'Achery/ (1609-1685), /Stephen Baluze/ (1630-1718), /Jean\r\nMabillon/ (1632-1704), /Edmond Martene/ (1654-1739), /Ruinart/ (1657-\r\n1709), /Muratori/ (1672-1750), /Bouquet/ (1685-1754), /Jean Hardouin,\r\nS.J./ (1646-1729), /Domenico Mansi/ (1692-1769), and the Orientalists\r\nJoseph /Simeon Assemani/ (1687-1768) and his brother /Joseph Aloysius/\r\n(1710-82) laid the foundations of modern historical research, by their\r\npublication of correct editions of the Early and Middle Age writers\r\nand of the decrees of the various general, national, and provincial\r\ncouncils, as well as by the example which they set in their own\r\nscholarly dissertations of how historical materials should be used. In\r\naddition to the publication of collections of original sources, works\r\nlike the /Gallia Christiana/, begun in 1715 by the Benedictines of St.\r\nMaur and continued by them till the Revolution, /Espana Sagrada/ begun\r\nby the Augustinian Enrique Florez in 1747, and the /Italia Sacra/\r\n(1643-1662) of Ferdinand Ughelli contained a veritable mine of\r\ninformation for future historians. Of the historical writers of this\r\nperiod the ablest were /Louis Sebastien Le Nain de Tillemont/ (1637-\r\n1689), the author of the /Histoire des Empereurs pendant les six\r\npremiers Siecles/ and /Memoires pour servir a l'histoire eccl. des six\r\npremiers siecles/ (1693); /Claude Fleury/ (1640-1725) whose great\r\nwork, /Histoire Ecclesiastique/ (dealing with the period from the\r\nAscension till the Council of Constance, 1414) is marred only by the\r\nGallican tendencies of its author, and /Natalis Alexander/ (Noel\r\nAlexandre, 1639-1724), a French Dominican who published an exceedingly\r\nvaluable Church History under the title /Selecta Historiae Eccl.\r\nCapita/, etc., but which was condemned by Innocent XI. (1684) on\r\naccount of the markedly Gallican bias under which it was composed.\r\n\r\nAmongst some of the most noted authorities on Canon Law during the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries were /Benedict XIV./ (1675-1758)\r\nmany of whose treatises are regarded as standard works till the\r\npresent day; /Pirhing/ (1606-1679), a Jesuit, professor at Dillingen\r\nand Ingolstadt and well known as a theologian and canonist;\r\n/Reiffenstuel/ (1641-1703), a Bavarian Franciscan for some time\r\nprofessor at Freising, the author of several theological works, and\r\nunequalled as a Canonist in his own day; /Van Espen/ (1649-1728)\r\nprofessor at Louvain, a strong supporter of Gallicanism and Jansenism,\r\nwhose great work /Jus Canonicum Universum/ is marred by the pro-\r\nGallican proclivities of its author; /Schmalzgrueber/ (1663-1735), a\r\nBavarian Jesuit, professor of Canon Law at Dillingen and Ingolstadt,\r\nwho in addition to treatises on such subjects as Trials, Espousals,\r\nMatrimony, and the Regular and Secular Clergy, published a work\r\ncovering the entire Canon Law (/Jus Eccl. Universum/), and the Italian\r\n/Lucius Ferraris/ (d. 1763), whose /Prompta Bibliotheca Canonica/ went\r\nthrough several editions in the author's own lifetime and has been\r\nrepublished more than once since his death (latest edition 1899).\r\n\r\nIn the department of sacred oratory the palm must undoubtedly be\r\nawarded to the French Church. /Jacques-Benigne Bossuet/[5] (1627-\r\n1704), in many senses the greatest of the French preachers, was the\r\nson of a lawyer at Dijon. Even in his early youth he was remarkable\r\nfor his mastery of the Bible and classical authors. He studied at the\r\nUniversity of Paris, and after remaining two years under the spiritual\r\neducation of St. Vincent de Paul was ordained a priest in 1662. He\r\nreturned to Metz, in the cathedral of which he held a canonry, and\r\nwhere his abilities as a preacher and a controversialist soon\r\nattracted attention. He was appointed preceptor to the Dauphin of\r\nFrance, an office which he held from 1670 to 1681, when he was\r\nconsecrated Bishop of Meaux. As bishop he took part in the Assembly of\r\nthe French Clergy (1681-82) and, though himself not such an extreme\r\ndefender of Gallicanism as many of his contemporaries, he is credited\r\ngenerally with having been the author of the famous Declaration of the\r\nClergy, known as the Articles of the Gallican Church. At the\r\ninvitation of Louis XIV. he composed a treatise in defence of these\r\narticles, /Defensio Declarationis/, etc., published after his death\r\n(1730). As an orator Bossuet was far ahead of the preachers of his\r\ntime, and as a writer and controversialist he had few equals. His\r\nuntiring energy and ability are vouched for by the number of able\r\nworks that proceeded from his pen. Of these the most instructive and\r\nbest known are the /Discours sur l'histoire Universelle/ (1681), and\r\nthe /Histoire des Variations des Eglises Protestantes/ (1688-89). His\r\nwant of firmness, however, in his relations with the court, leading\r\nhim as it did to show a sympathy which he could not have felt in his\r\nheart towards Gallicanism, his failure to move a finger to stay the\r\nravages of Jansenism, his want of zeal for the spiritual care of his\r\ndiocese, in marked contrast with the energy which he displayed when\r\nseeking to score a personal triumph over Fenelon and other less known\r\nadversaries, cannot be forgotten by any one who wishes to arrive at an\r\nimpartial estimate of Bossuet's character.\r\n\r\n/Fenelon/[6] (1651-1715), the great contemporary and rival of Bossuet,\r\nwas sent as a youth for his education to the Universities of Cahors\r\nand Paris. Later on he returned to the seminary of Saint Sulpice then\r\npresided over by M. Tronson the superior of the Sulpicians, to whose\r\nwise and prudent counsels the future Archbishop of Cambrai was deeply\r\nindebted. After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes he was sent to\r\npreach to the Huguenots, upon whom his kindness and humility made a\r\nmuch more lasting impression than the violence resorted to by some of\r\nthe officials of Louis XIV. Later on he was appointed preceptor to the\r\nDuke of Burgundy, grandson of Louis XIV., for whose education he\r\ncomposed the /Fables, Telemaque/, etc., and on the completion of his\r\nwork as tutor he was nominated Archbishop of Cambrai (1695). Hardly\r\nhad he received this honour than he was involved in a controversy on\r\nQuietism, which controversy cost him the friendship of Bossuet and the\r\npatronage of Louis XIV., by whom he was banished from the French\r\ncourt. But Fenelon found much at Cambrai to console him for what he\r\nhad lost in Paris. In every sense of the word he proved himself a\r\nmodel bishop, visiting his parishes regularly, preaching in his\r\ncathedral and throughout his diocese, and always affable to those who\r\ncame in contact with him whether they were rich or poor. Unlike\r\nBossuet he never feared to speak out boldly against Jansenism and\r\nGallicanism. As a preacher and a master of French literary style he\r\nwas inferior to Bossuet, but as a man and as a bishop he was\r\nincomparably his superior. In addition to his works on literary and\r\npolitical questions he wrote voluminously on theology, philosophy, and\r\nthe spiritual life.\r\n\r\nThe opposition to Scholasticism, that manifested itself in the\r\nwritings and teaching of so many Humanists, grew more accentuated in\r\nthe universities, especially after the establishment of ecclesiastical\r\nseminaries had led to the withdrawal from the universities of a great\r\nbody of the clerical students. For centuries philosophy and theology\r\nhad gone hand in hand, the former supplying the rational basis for the\r\nacceptance of revelation, the latter providing the necessary restraint\r\nupon the vagaries of human thought. The principal of individual\r\njudgment, proclaimed by the early Reformers and received so\r\nenthusiastically by their followers, had as its logical consequence an\r\nexaggeration of the powers of the human mind at the expense of\r\nauthority, with the result that scepticism, atheism, and materialism,\r\nfound favour in learned circles.\r\n\r\nIn face of such evident proofs of the limitations of the human mind,\r\nand with the object of preserving in one way or another the Christian\r\nRevelation, a reaction against the supposed infallibility of reason\r\nset in both amongst Protestant and Catholic scholars. Catholic\r\nphilosophers were inclined to distrust reason entirely, and to rely\r\nsolely on divine authority as a guarantee of truth. In other words\r\nthey accepted Traditionalism, while Protestants, equally suspicious of\r\nreason, proclaimed that in judging the value of revelation the human\r\nwill and sentiment must be heeded as well as the intellect, that is to\r\nsay they accepted Sentimentalism.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to replace Scholasticism by some new philosophic system\r\ngave rise to various schools of thought, most of which can be traced\r\nback ultimately to Bacon and Descartes, the former a partisan of the\r\ninductive, the latter of the deductive method. /Rene Descartes/[7]\r\n(1596-1649) was born at Touraine, and received his early education\r\nwith the Jesuits. In his desire to see the world for himself he took\r\nservice as a soldier in the army of Prince Maurice of Nassau, and\r\nlater on in that of the Elector of Bavaria. He retired from active\r\nlife to give himself up to the study of mathematics and philosophy. At\r\nfirst he found a quiet retreat in Holland, from which he migrated to\r\nStockholm at the invitation of Queen Christina. Here after a few\r\nmonths' residence he died. Throughout his life Descartes remained a\r\nsincere and practical Catholic. Putting aside Revelation, with which\r\nhe did not profess to deal, Descartes, by an application of his\r\nprinciple of methodic doubt, arrived at the conclusion that the\r\nfoundation of all certainty lay in the proposition /Cogito ergo sum/\r\n(I think, therefore I exist). From an examination of his own ideas of\r\na most perfect being he arrived at the conclusion that God exists, and\r\nfrom the existence of a good and wise supreme Being who has given men\r\nreason, sense, and perception in order to acquire knowledge, he argued\r\nthat these faculties cannot lead men into error, and that consequently\r\nthe veracity of God was the ultimate basis of certitude.\r\n\r\nThe theories of Descartes were pushed to their logical conclusion by\r\nthose who succeeded him. /Blaise Pascal/[8] (1623-1662) was influenced\r\nlargely by the false mysticism of the Middle Ages. He distrusted\r\nreason and exalted faith, as the only means of answering the\r\ndifficulties that pure intellectualism could not solve. /Arnold\r\nGeulincx/ (1625-1669) at first a Catholic and afterwards a Calvinist,\r\narguing from the antithesis supposed by Descartes to exist between\r\nmind and matter, maintained that since matter was inert it could not\r\nproduce the sensations and volitions which men experienced, and that\r\ntherefore these must be caused by God. In other words he propounded\r\nthe theory of Occasionalism. This doctrine of Occasionalism as\r\nfurnishing an explanation of sensations was extended by Malebranche[9]\r\n(1638-1715), a student of the Sorbonne, so as to explain the origin of\r\nhuman ideas. These he maintained could not come from outside, because\r\nthere can be no contact between mind and matter; they could not come\r\nfrom the mind itself, because creation is an attribute only of the\r\ninfinite being, and therefore they must come from God. Hence,\r\naccording to him, it is in God or in the divine essence that we see\r\nall things (Ontologism). If all activity and all knowledge come\r\ndirectly from God, it was only natural to conclude, as did /Spinoza/\r\n(1632-77), that there exists only one substance endowed with the two\r\nattributes of thought and extension (Monism, Pantheism).[10]\r\n\r\nFrom this brief sketch it will be seen that the rejection of the\r\nScholastic System and the divorce between theology and philosophy led\r\nto dogmatic chaos, and ultimately to the rejection of divine\r\nrevelation. By his attacks on the old proofs given for the existence\r\nof God and the motives of credibility, by the emphasis which he placed\r\nupon methodic doubt as the only safe way to certainty, and by the\r\nsuspicions raised by him against the reliability of human reason,\r\nDescartes unwittingly paved the way for scepticism and atheism. Though\r\nhis system was condemned by Rome and forbidden more than once by Louis\r\nXIV. it was taken up by the Oratorians and by most of the leading\r\nscholars in France.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the eighteenth century was distinctly unfavourable to\r\nthe religious orders. The Rationalists, the Freemasons, and the\r\nfriends of absolutism joined hands in opposing the foundation of new\r\nestablishments and in securing the suppression of the houses that had\r\nalready been founded. In Austria, in Naples, in Spain, and in France a\r\nviolent campaign was carried on to bring about the dissolution of\r\nseveral of the religious orders and congregations, or at least to so\r\nalter their rules and constitutions that they should be cut adrift\r\nfrom Rome and subject to the authority of the secular rulers. During\r\nthe campaign many houses were suppressed in Austria and in the other\r\nterritories of the empire, but by far the greatest victory of which\r\nits authors could boast was the suppression of the Society of Jesus.\r\n\r\nYet in spite of the enemies of the Church the religious orders held\r\ntheir ground, and apostolic men arose to lay the foundations of new\r\nbodies, that were destined to take a glorious part in the religious\r\nrevival of the nineteenth century. One of the most remarkable of these\r\nwas St. Alphonsus Maria de' Liguori[11] (1696-1787). He was born near\r\nNaples, adopted at first the profession of a lawyer, but he soon\r\nforsook the bar to give himself entirely to God, and was ordained a\r\npriest in 1726. In 1732 he laid the foundation of a new religious\r\nsociety, the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, which was\r\napproved by Benedict XIV. in 1749. After having refused various\r\nhonours he was compelled to accept the Bishopric of St. Agatha (1762)\r\nfrom which he retired in 1775 to devote himself to prayer, and to the\r\ncomposition of those spiritual treatises that have given him such a\r\nleading place not merely as a moral theologian but as a master in the\r\nascetic life. In 1744 he issued his Notes on Busenbaum's Moral\r\nTheology, which notes formed the basis of his /Theologia Moralis/\r\npublished in 1753-55, and which went through nine editions during his\r\nown life-time. He was declared Venerable (1796), canonised (1839), and\r\nrecognised as a Doctor of the Church (1871).\r\n\r\nThe Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer (The Redemptorists) was\r\nfounded by St. Alphonsus at Scala, near Amalfi, in the kingdom of\r\nNaples (1732), and was approved in 1749. The aim of its members was to\r\nimitate the virtues and example of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, by\r\nconsecrating themselves especially to preaching the word of God to the\r\npoor. The opposition of the Neapolitan prime minister, Tanucci, was a\r\nsource of great trouble to the holy founder. On the fall of Tanucci\r\nSt. Alphonsus thought that a favourable opportunity had come for\r\nsecuring the approval of the government, but he was betrayed by his\r\nfriends into accepting a modification of the constitution, the\r\n/Regolamento/ (1779-80), which led to a separation between the\r\nRedemptorist houses in Naples and those situated in the Papal States.\r\nThe dispute was, however, healed in 1793. The Society spread rapidly\r\nin Italy, in Germany, where its interests were safeguarded by Father\r\nHofbauer, and during the nineteenth century houses were established in\r\nevery country in Europe, in America and in Australia.\r\n\r\nThe Passionists[12] (The Congregation of Discalced Clerics of the Most\r\nHoly Cross and Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ) were founded by St.\r\nPaul of the Cross (1694-1775). The latter was born at Ovada near\r\nGenoa, was ordained by Pope Benedict XIII. (1727) who at the same time\r\ngave his approval of the rules drawn up for the new society, founded\r\nhis first house at Argentaro, and thereby laid the foundation of the\r\nCongregation of the Passionists. The new society received the formal\r\nsanction and approval of Clement XIV. (1769) and of Pius VI. (1775).\r\nBefore the death of the founder several houses had been established in\r\nItaly, all of which were suppressed during the disturbances that\r\nfollowed in the wake of the French Revolution. The congregation was,\r\nhowever, re-constituted by Pius VII. (1814), and spread rapidly in\r\nEurope, in the United States, and in South America. The first house of\r\nthe Passionists in England was established by the celebrated Father\r\nDominic at Aston Hall in Staffordshire (1842), and the first house in\r\nIreland was opened at Mount Argus in 1856.\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n[1] /Summa S.
