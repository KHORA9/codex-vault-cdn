We formed three depots and\r\nstored in them 3 tons of provisions, including 22 hundredweight of\r\nseal meat. As there were no landmarks, we had to indicate the position\r\nof our depots by flags, which were posted at a distance of about four\r\nmiles to the east and west. The first barrier afforded the best going,\r\nand was specially adapted for dog-sledging. Thus, on February 15 we\r\ndid sixty-two miles with sledges. Each sledge weighed 660 pounds,\r\nand we had six dogs for each. The upper barrier (\"barrier surface\")\r\nwas smooth and even. There were a few crevasses here and there, but\r\nwe only found them dangerous at one or two points. The barrier went\r\nin long, regular undulations. The weather was very favourable, with\r\ncalms or light winds. The lowest temperature at this station was -49deg.\r\nF., which was taken on March 4.\r\n\r\nWhen we returned to winter quarters on February 5 from a first trip,\r\nwe found that the Fram had already left us. With joy and pride we heard\r\nfrom those who had stayed behind that our gallant captain had succeeded\r\nin sailing her farther south than any former ship. So the good old\r\nFram has shown the flag of Norway both farthest north and farthest\r\nsouth. The most southerly latitude reached by the Fram was 78deg. 41'.\r\n\r\nBefore the winter set in we had 60 tons of seal meat in our winter\r\nquarters; this was enough for ourselves and our 110 dogs. We had built\r\neight kennels and a number of connecting tents and snow huts. When we\r\nhad provided for the dogs, we thought of ourselves. Our little hut\r\nwas almost entirely covered with snow. Not till the middle of April\r\ndid we decide to adopt artificial light in the hut. This we did with\r\nthe help of a Lux lamp of 200 candle-power, which gave an excellent\r\nlight and kept the indoor temperature at about 68deg. F. throughout the\r\nwinter. The ventilation was very satisfactory, and we got sufficient\r\nfresh air. The hut was directly connected with the house in which we\r\nhad our workshop, larder, storeroom, and cellar, besides a single\r\nbathroom and observatory. Thus we had everything within doors and\r\neasily got at, in case the weather should be so cold and stormy that\r\nwe could not venture out.\r\n\r\nThe sun left us on April 22, and we did not see it again for four\r\nmonths. We spent the winter in altering our whole equipment, which our\r\ndepot journeys had shown to be too heavy and clumsy for the smooth\r\nbarrier surface. At the same time we carried out all the scientific\r\nwork for which there was opportunity. We made a number of surprising\r\nmeteorological observations. There was very little snow, in spite\r\nof there being open water in the neighbourhood. We had expected to\r\nobserve higher temperatures in the course of the winter, but the\r\nthermometer remained very low. During five months temperatures were\r\nobserved varying between -58deg. and -74deg. F. We had the lowest (-74deg.\r\nF.) on August 13; the weather was calm. On August 1 we had -72deg.\r\nF. with a wind of thirteen miles an hour. The mean temperature for\r\nthe year was -15deg. F. We expected blizzard after blizzard, but had\r\nonly two moderate storms. We made many excellent observations of the\r\naurora australis in all parts of the heavens. Our bill of health was\r\nthe best possible throughout the whole winter. When the sun returned\r\non August 24 it shone upon men who were healthy in mind and body,\r\nand ready to begin the task that lay before them.\r\n\r\nWe had brought the sledges the day before to the starting-point of the\r\nsouthern journey. At the beginning of September the temperature rose,\r\nand it was decided to commence the journey. On September 8 a party of\r\neight men set out, with seven sledges and ninety dogs, provisioned for\r\nninety days. The surface was excellent, and the temperature not so bad\r\nas it might have been. But on the following day we saw that we had\r\nstarted too early. The temperature then fell, and remained for some\r\ndays between -58deg. and -75deg. F. Personally we did not suffer at all, as\r\nwe had good fur clothing, but with the dogs it was another matter. They\r\ngrew lanker and lanker every day, and we soon saw that they would not\r\nbe able to stand it in the long run. At our depot in lat. 80deg. we agreed\r\nto turn back and await the arrival of spring. After having stored our\r\nprovisions, we returned to the hut. Excepting the loss of a few dogs\r\nand one or two frostbitten heels, all was well. It was not till the\r\nmiddle of October that the spring began in earnest. Seals and birds\r\nwere sighted. The temperature remained steady, between -5deg. and -22deg. F.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we had abandoned the original plan, by which all were to\r\ngo to the south. Five men were to do this, while three others made\r\na trip to the east, to visit King Edward VII. Land. This trip did\r\nnot form part of our programme, but as the English did not reach\r\nthis land last summer, as had been their intention, we agreed that\r\nit would be best to undertake this journey in addition.\r\n\r\nOn October 20 the southern party left. It consisted of five men\r\nwith four sledges and fifty-two dogs, and had provisions for four\r\nmonths. Everything was in excellent order, and we had made up our minds\r\nto take it easy during the first part of the journey, so that we and\r\nthe dogs might not be too fatigued, and we therefore decided to make\r\na little halt on the 22nd at the depot that lay in lat. 80deg.. However,\r\nwe missed the mark owing to thick fog, but after two or three miles'\r\nmarch we found the place again.\r\n\r\nWhen we had rested here and given the dogs as much seal meat as\r\nthey were able to eat, we started again on the 26th. The temperature\r\nremained steady, between -5deg. and -22deg. F.\r\n\r\nAt first we had made up our minds not to drive more than twelve to\r\neighteen miles a day; but this proved to be too little, thanks to\r\nour strong and willing animals. At lat. 80deg. we began to erect snow\r\nbeacons, about the height of a man, to show us the way home.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st we reached the depot in lat. 81deg.. We halted for a day\r\nand fed the dogs on pemmican. On November 5 we reached the depot\r\nin 82deg., where for the last time the dogs got as much to eat as they\r\ncould manage.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th we started southward again, and now made a daily march of\r\nabout thirty miles. In order to relieve the heavily laden sledges, we\r\nformed a depot at every parallel we reached. The journey from lat. 82deg.\r\nto 83deg. was a pure pleasure trip, on account of the surface and the\r\ntemperature, which were as favourable as one could wish. Everything\r\nwent swimmingly until the 9th, when we sighted South Victoria Land\r\nand the continuation of the mountain chain, which Shackleton gives\r\non his map, running southeast from Beardmore Glacier. On the same\r\nday we reached lat. 83deg., and established here Depot No. 4.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th we made the interesting discovery that the Ross Barrier\r\nended in an elevation on the south-east, formed between a chain of\r\nmountains running south-eastward from South Victoria Land and another\r\nchain on the opposite side, which runs south-westward in continuation\r\nof King Edward VII. Land.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th we reached lat. 84deg., where we established a depot. On the\r\n16th we got to 85deg., where again we formed a depot. From our winter\r\nquarters at Framheim we had marched due south the whole time.\r\n\r\nOn November 17, in lat. 85deg., we came to a spot where the land barrier\r\nintersected our route, though for the time being this did not cause\r\nus any difficulty. The barrier here rises in the form of a wave to\r\na height of about 300 feet, and its limit is shown by a few large\r\nfissures. Here we established our main depot. We took supplies for\r\nsixty days on the sledges and left behind enough provisions for\r\nthirty days.\r\n\r\nThe land under which we now lay, and which we were to attack, looked\r\nperfectly impossible, with peaks along the barrier which rose to\r\nheights of from 2,000 to 10,000 feet. Farther south we saw more peaks,\r\nof 15,000 feet or higher.\r\n\r\nNext day we began to climb. The first part of the work was easy,\r\nas the ground rose gradually with smooth snow-slopes below the\r\nmountain-side. Our dogs working well, it did not take us long to get\r\nover these slopes.\r\n\r\nAt the next point we met with some small, very steep glaciers,\r\nand here we had to harness twenty dogs to each sledge and take the\r\nfour sledges in two journeys. Some places were so steep that it was\r\ndifficult to use our ski. Several times we were compelled by deep\r\ncrevasses to turn back.\r\n\r\nOn the first day we climbed 2,000 feet. The next day we crossed\r\nsmall glaciers, and camped at a height of 4,635 feet. On the third\r\nday we were obliged to descend the great Axel Heiberg Glacier, which\r\nseparates the mountains of the coast from those farther south.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the longest part of our climbing began. Many\r\ndetours had to be made to avoid broad fissures and open crevasses. Most\r\nof them were filled up, as in all probability the glacier had long\r\nago ceased to move; but we had to be very careful, nevertheless,\r\nas we could never know the depth of snow that covered them. Our camp\r\nthat night was in very picturesque surroundings, at a height of about\r\n5,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe glacier was here imprisoned between two mountains of 15,000 feet,\r\nwhich we named after Fridtjof Nansen and Don Pedro Christophersen.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the glacier we saw Ole Engelstad's great snow-cone\r\nrising in the air to 19,000 feet. The glacier was much broken up in\r\nthis narrow defile; enormous crevasses seemed as if they would stop\r\nour going farther, but fortunately it was not so bad as it looked.\r\n\r\nOur dogs, which during the last few days had covered a distance of\r\nnearly 440 miles, put in a very good piece of work that day, as they\r\ndid twenty-two miles on ground rising to 5,770 feet. It was an almost\r\nincredible record. It only took us four days from the barrier to reach\r\nthe immense inland plateau. We camped at a height of 7,600 feet. Here\r\nwe had to kill twenty-four of our brave dogs, keeping eighteen --\r\nsix for each of our three sledges. We halted here for four days on\r\naccount of bad weather. On November 25 we were tired of waiting, and\r\nstarted again. On the 26th we were overtaken by a raging blizzard. In\r\nthe thick, driving snow we could see absolutely nothing; but we felt\r\nthat, contrary to what we had expected -- namely, a further ascent\r\n-- we were going rapidly downhill. The hypsometer that day showed a\r\ndescent of 600 feet. We continued our march next day in a strong wind\r\nand thick, driving snow. Our faces were badly frozen. There was no\r\ndanger, but we simply could see nothing. Next day, according to our\r\nreckoning, we reached lat. 86deg.. The hypsometer showed a fall of 800\r\nfeet. The following day passed in the same way. The weather cleared up\r\nabout noon, and there appeared to our astonished eyes a mighty mountain\r\nrange to the east of us, and not far away. But the vision only lasted\r\na moment, and then disappeared again in the driving snow. On the 29th\r\nthe weather became calmer and the sun shone -- a pleasant surprise. Our\r\ncourse lay over a great glacier, which ran in a southerly direction. On\r\nits eastern side was a chain of mountains running to the southeast. We\r\nhad no view of its western part, as this was lost in a thick fog. At\r\nthe foot of the Devil's Glacier we established a depot in lat. 86deg.\r\n21', calculated for six days. The hypsometer showed 8,000 feet above\r\nsea level. On November 30 we began to ascend the glacier. The lower\r\npart was much broken up and dangerous, and the thin bridges of snow\r\nover the crevasses often broke under us. From our camp that evening\r\nwe had a splendid view of the mountains to the east. Mount Helmer\r\nHansen was the most remarkable of them all; it was 12,000 feet high,\r\nand covered by a glacier so rugged that in all probability it would\r\nhave been impossible to find foothold on it. Here were also Mounts\r\nOskar Wisting, Sverre Hassel, and Olav Bjaaland, grandly lighted up\r\nby the rays of the sun. In the distance, and only visible from time\r\nto time through the driving mists, we saw Mount Thorvald Nilsen,\r\nwith peaks rising to 15,000 feet. We could only see those parts of\r\nthem that lay nearest to us. It took us three days to get over the\r\nDevil's Glacier, as the weather was unusually misty.\r\n\r\nOn December 1 we left the glacier in high spirits. It was cut up by\r\ninnumerable crevasses and holes. We were now at a height of 9,370\r\nfeet. In the mist and driving snow it looked as if we had a frozen\r\nlake before us; but it proved to be a sloping plateau of ice, full\r\nof small blocks of ice. Our walk across this frozen lake was not\r\npleasant. The ground under our feet was evidently hollow, and it\r\nsounded as if we were walking on empty barrels. First a man fell\r\nthrough, then a couple of dogs; but they got up again all right. We\r\ncould not, of course, use our ski on this smooth-polished ice, but we\r\ngot on fairly well with the sledges. We called this place the Devil's\r\nBallroom. This part of our march was the most unpleasant of the whole\r\ntrip. On December 2 we reached our greatest elevation. According to\r\nthe hypsometer and our aneroid barometer we were at a height of 11,075\r\nfeet -- this was in lat. 87deg. 51'. On December 8 the bad weather came\r\nto an end, the sun shone on us once more, and we were able to take our\r\nobservations again. It proved that the observations and our reckoning\r\nof the distance covered gave exactly the same result -- namely, 88deg.\r\n16' S. lat. Before us lay an absolutely flat plateau, only broken\r\nby small crevices. In the afternoon we passed 88deg. 23', Shackleton's\r\nfarthest south. We pitched our camp in 88deg. 25', and established our\r\nlast depot -- No. 10. From 88deg. 25' the plateau began to descend evenly\r\nand very slowly. We reached 88deg. 29' on December 9. On December 10, 88deg.\r\n56'; December 11, 89deg. 15'; December 12, 89deg. 30'; December 13, 89deg. 45'.\r\n\r\nUp to this moment the observations and our reckoning had shown a\r\nsurprising agreement. We reckoned that we should be at the Pole on\r\nDecember 14. On the afternoon of that day we had brilliant weather --\r\na light wind from the south-east with a temperature of -10deg. F. The\r\nsledges were going very well. The day passed without any occurrence\r\nworth mentioning, and at three o'clock in the afternoon we halted,\r\nas according to our reckoning we had reached our goal.\r\n\r\nWe all assembled about the Norwegian flag -- a handsome silken flag --\r\nwhich we took and planted all together, and gave the immense plateau\r\non which the Pole is situated the name of \"King Haakon VII.'s Plateau.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a vast plain of the same character in every direction, mile\r\nafter mile. During the afternoon we traversed the neighbourhood of\r\nthe camp, and on the following day, as the weather was fine, we were\r\noccupied from six in the morning till seven in the evening in taking\r\nobservations, which gave us 89deg. 55' as the result. In order to take\r\nobservations as near the Pole as possible, we went on, as near true\r\nsouth as we could, for the remaining 9 kilometres. On December 16 we\r\npitched our camp in brilliant sunshine, with the best conditions for\r\ntaking observations. Four of us took observations every hour of the\r\nday -- twenty-four in all. The results of these will be submitted to\r\nthe examination of experts.\r\n\r\nWe have thus taken observations as near to the Pole as was humanly\r\npossible with the instruments at our disposal. We had a sextant and\r\nartificial horizon calculated for a radius of 8 kilometres.\r\n\r\nOn December 17 we were ready to go. We raised on the spot a little\r\ncircular tent, and planted above it the Norwegian flag and the Fram's\r\npennant. The Norwegian camp at the South Pole was given the name of\r\n\"Polheim.\" The distance from our winter quarters to the Pole was about\r\n870 English miles, so that we had covered on an average 15 1/2 miles\r\na day.\r\n\r\nWe began the return journey on December 17. The weather was unusually\r\nfavourable, and this made our return considerably easier than the\r\nmarch to the Pole. We arrived at \"Framheim,\" our winter quarters,\r\nin January, 1912, with two sledges and eleven dogs, all well. On the\r\nhomeward journey we covered an average of 22 1/2 miles a day. The\r\nlowest temperature we observed on this trip was -24deg. F., and the\r\nhighest +23deg. F.\r\n\r\nThe principal result  --  besides the attainment of the Pole  --  is\r\nthe determination of the extent and character of the Ross Barrier. Next\r\nto this, the discovery of a connection between South Victoria Land\r\nand, probably, King Edward VII. Land through their continuation in\r\nhuge mountain-ranges, which run to the south-east and were seen as far\r\nsouth as lat. 88deg. 8', but which in all probability are continued right\r\nacross the Antarctic Continent. We gave the name of \"Queen Maud's\r\nMountains\" to the whole range of these newly discovered mountains,\r\nabout 530 miles in length.\r\n\r\nThe expedition to King Edward VII. Land, under Lieutenant Prestrud,\r\nhas achieved excellent results. Scott's discovery was confirmed, and\r\nthe examination of the Bay of Whales and the Ice Barrier, which the\r\nparty carried out, is of great interest. Good geological collections\r\nhave been obtained from King Edward VII. Land and South Victoria Land.\r\n\r\nThe Fram arrived at the Bay of Whales on January 9, having been\r\ndelayed in the \"Roaring Forties \" by easterly winds.\r\n\r\nOn January 16 the Japanese expedition arrived at the Bay of Whales,\r\nand landed on the Barrier near our winter quarters.\r\n\r\nWe left the Bay of Whales on January 30. We had a long voyage on\r\naccount of contrary wind.\r\n\r\nWe are all in the best of health.\r\n\r\nRoald Amundsen.\r\n\r\nHobart,\r\n\r\nMarch 8, 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nWhen the explorer comes home victorious, everyone goes out to cheer\r\nhim. We are all proud of his achievement -- proud on behalf of the\r\nnation and of humanity. We think it is a new feather in our cap,\r\nand one we have come by cheaply.\r\n\r\nHow many of those who join in the cheering were there when the\r\nexpedition was fitting out, when it was short of bare necessities,\r\nwhen support and assistance were most urgently wanted? Was there\r\nthen any race to be first? At such a time the leader has usually\r\nfound himself almost alone; too often he has had to confess that his\r\ngreatest difficulties were those he had to overcome at home before\r\nhe could set sail. So it was with Columbus, and so it has been with\r\nmany since his time.\r\n\r\nSo it was, too, with Roald Amundsen -- not only the first time, when he\r\nsailed in the Gjoa with the double object of discovering the Magnetic\r\nNorth Pole and of making the North-West Passage, but this time again,\r\nwhen in 1910 he left the fjord on his great expedition in the Fram,\r\nto drift right across the North Polar Sea. What anxieties that man has\r\ngone through, which might have been spared him if there had been more\r\nappreciation on the part of those who had it in their power to make\r\nthings easier! And Amundsen had then shown what stuff he was made of:\r\nboth the great objects of the Gjoa's expedition were achieved. He\r\nhas always reached the goal he has aimed at, this man who sailed his\r\nlittle yacht over the whole Arctic Ocean, round the north of America,\r\non the course that had been sought in vain for four hundred years. If\r\nhe staked his life and abilities, would it not have been natural if\r\nwe had been proud of having such a man to support?\r\n\r\nBut was it so?\r\n\r\nFor a long time he struggled to complete his equipment. Money was still\r\nlacking, and little interest was shown in him and his work, outside the\r\nfew who have always helped so far as was in their power. He himself\r\ngave everything he possessed in the world. But this time, as last,\r\nhe nevertheless had to put to sea loaded with anxieties and debts,\r\nand, as before, he sailed out quietly on a summer night.\r\n\r\nAutumn was drawing on. One day there came a letter from him. In\r\norder to raise the money he could not get at home for his North Polar\r\nexpedition he was going to the South Pole first. People stood still\r\n-- did not know what to say. This was an unheard-of thing, to make\r\nfor the North Pole by way of the South Pole! To make such an immense\r\nand entirely new addition to his plans without asking leave! Some\r\nthought it grand; more thought it doubtful; but there were many who\r\ncried out that it was inadmissible, disloyal -- nay, there were some\r\nwho wanted to have him stopped. But nothing of this reached him. He\r\nhad steered his course as he himself had set it, without looking back.\r\n\r\nThen by degrees it was forgotten, and everyone went on with his own\r\naffairs. The mists were upon us day after day, week after week --\r\nthe mists that are kind to little men and swallow up all that is\r\ngreat and towers above them.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a bright spring day cuts through the bank of fog. There\r\nis a new message. People stop again and look up. High above them\r\nshines a deed, a man. A wave of joy runs through the souls of men;\r\ntheir eyes are bright as the flags that wave about them.\r\n\r\nWhy? On account of the great geographical discoveries, the\r\nimportant scientific results? Oh no; that will come later, for the\r\nfew specialists. This is something all can understand. A victory of\r\nhuman mind and human strength over the dominion and powers of Nature;\r\na deed that lifts us above the grey monotony of daily life; a view\r\nover shining plains, with lofty mountains against the cold blue sky,\r\nand lands covered by ice-sheets of inconceivable extent; a vision\r\nof long-vanished glacial times; the triumph of the living over the\r\nstiffened realm of death. There is a ring of steeled, purposeful\r\nhuman will -- through icy frosts, snowstorms, and death.\r\n\r\nFor the victory is not due to the great inventions of the present\r\nday and the many new appliances of every kind. The means used are\r\nof immense antiquity, the same as were known to the nomad thousands\r\nof years ago, when he pushed forward across the snow-covered plains\r\nof Siberia and Northern Europe. But everything, great and small, was\r\nthoroughly thought out, and the plan was splendidly executed. It is\r\nthe man that matters, here as everywhere.\r\n\r\nLike everything great, it all looks so plain and simple. Of course,\r\nthat is just as it had to be, we think.\r\n\r\nApart from the discoveries and experiences of earlier explorers --\r\nwhich, of course, were a necessary condition of success -- both\r\nthe plan and its execution are the ripe fruit of Norwegian life\r\nand experience in ancient and modern times. The Norwegians' daily\r\nwinter life in snow and frost, our peasants' constant use of ski and\r\nski-sledge in forest and mountain, our sailors' yearly whaling and\r\nsealing life in the Polar Sea, our explorers' journeys in the Arctic\r\nregions -- it was all this, with the dog as a draught animal borrowed\r\nfrom the primitive races, that formed the foundation of the plan and\r\nrendered its execution possible -- when the man appeared.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when the man is there, it carries him through all\r\ndifficulties as if they did not exist; every one of them has been\r\nforeseen and encountered in advance. Let no one come and prate\r\nabout luck and chance. Amundsen's luck is that of the strong man who\r\nlooks ahead.\r\n\r\nHow like him and the whole expedition is his telegram home -- as\r\nsimple and straightforward as if it concerned a holiday tour in the\r\nmountains. It speaks of what is achieved, not of their hardships. Every\r\nword a manly one. That is the mark of the right man, quiet and strong.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is still too early to measure the extent of the new discoveries,\r\nbut the cablegram has already dispersed the mists so far that the\r\noutlines are beginning to shape themselves. That fairyland of ice, so\r\ndifferent from all other lands, is gradually rising out of the clouds.\r\n\r\nIn this wonderful world of ice Amundsen has found his own way. From\r\nfirst to last he and his companions have traversed entirely unknown\r\nregions on their ski, and there are not many expeditions in history\r\nthat have brought under the foot of man so long a range of country\r\nhitherto unseen by human eye. People thought it a matter of course that\r\nhe would make for Beardmore Glacier, which Shackleton had discovered,\r\nand by that route come out on to the high snow plateau near the Pole,\r\nsince there he would be sure of getting forward. We who knew Amundsen\r\nthought it would be more like him to avoid a place for the very reason\r\nthat it had been trodden by others. Happily we were right. Not at\r\nany point does his route touch that of the Englishmen -- except by\r\nthe Pole itself.\r\n\r\nThis is a great gain to research. When in a year's time we have Captain\r\nScott back safe and sound with all his discoveries and observations on\r\nthe other route, Amundsen's results will greatly increase in value,\r\nsince the conditions will then be illuminated from two sides. The\r\nsimultaneous advance towards the Pole from two separate points was\r\nprecisely the most fortunate thing that could happen for science. The\r\nregion investigated becomes so much greater, the discoveries so many\r\nmore, and the importance of the observations is more than doubled,\r\noften multiplied many times. Take, for instance, the meteorological\r\nconditions: a single series of observations from one spot no doubt has\r\nits value, but if we get a simultaneous series from another spot in\r\nthe same region, the value of both becomes very much greater, because\r\nwe then have an opportunity of understanding the movements of the\r\natmosphere. And so with other investigations. Scott's expedition will\r\ncertainly bring back rich and important results in many departments,\r\nbut the value of his observations will also be enhanced when placed\r\nside by side with Amundsen's.\r\n\r\nAn important addition to Amundsen's expedition to the Pole is the\r\nsledge journey of Lieutenant Prestrud and his two companions eastward\r\nto the unknown King Edward VII. Land, which Scott discovered in\r\n1902. It looks rather as if this land was connected with the masses\r\nof land and immense mountain-chains that Amundsen found near the\r\nPole. We see new problems looming up.\r\n\r\nBut it was not only these journeys over ice-sheets and mountain-ranges\r\nthat were carried out in masterly fashion. Our gratitude is also due\r\nto Captain Nilsen and his men. They brought the Fram backwards and\r\nforwards, twice each way, through those ice-filled southern waters\r\nthat many experts even held to be so dangerous that the Fram would\r\nnot be able to come through them, and on both trips this was done\r\nwith the speed and punctuality of a ship on her regular route. The\r\nFram's builder, the excellent Colin Archer, has reason to be proud\r\nof the way in which his \"child\" has performed her latest task --\r\nthis vessel that has been farthest north and farthest south on our\r\nglobe. But Captain Nilsen and the crew of the Fram have done more than\r\nthis; they have carried out a work of research which in scientific\r\nvalue may be compared with what their comrades have accomplished\r\nin the unknown world of ice, although most people will not be able\r\nto recognize this. While Amundsen and his companions were passing\r\nthe winter in the South, Captain Nilsen, in the Fram, investigated\r\nthe ocean between South America and Africa. At no fewer than sixty\r\nstations they took a number of temperatures, samples of water, and\r\nspecimens of the plankton in this little-known region, to a depth of\r\n2,000 fathoms and more. They thus made the first two sections that\r\nhave ever been taken of the South Atlantic, and added new regions of\r\nthe unknown ocean depths to human knowledge. The Fram's sections are\r\nthe longest and most complete that are known in any part of the ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\nWould it be unreasonable if those who have endured and achieved so much\r\nhad now come home to rest? But Amundsen points onward. So much for\r\nthat; now for the real object. Next year his course will be through\r\nBehring Strait into the ice and frost and darkness of the North, to\r\ndrift right across the North Polar Sea -- five years, at least. It\r\nseems almost superhuman; but he is the man for that, too. Fram is\r\nhis ship, \"forward\" is his motto, and he will come through.[1] He\r\nwill carry out his main expedition, the one that is now before him,\r\nas surely and steadily as that he has just come from.\r\n\r\nBut while we are waiting, let us rejoice over what has already been\r\nachieved. Let us follow the narrow sledge-tracks that the little black\r\ndots of dogs and men have drawn across the endless white surface down\r\nthere in the South -- like a railroad of exploration into the heart\r\nof the unknown. The wind in its everlasting flight sweeps over these\r\ntracks in the desert of snow. Soon all will be blotted out.\r\n\r\nBut the rails of science are laid; our knowledge is richer than before.\r\n\r\nAnd the light of the achievement shines for all time.\r\n\r\nFridtjof Nansen.\r\n\r\nLysaker,\r\n\r\nMay 3, 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIGURE 1\r\n\r\nThe Opening of Roald Amundsen's Manuscript.\r\n\r\nTo face page I, Vol. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nThe History of the South Pole[2]\r\n\r\n\"Life is a ball In the hands of chance.\"\r\n\r\nBrisbane, Queensland, April 13, 1912.\r\n\r\nHere I am, sitting in the shade of palms, surrounded by the most\r\nwonderful vegetation, enjoying the most magnificent fruits, and writing\r\n-- the history of the South Pole. What an infinite distance seems to\r\nseparate that region from these surroundings! And yet it is only four\r\nmonths since my gallant comrades and I reached the coveted spot.\r\n\r\nI write the history of the South Pole! If anyone had hinted a word of\r\nanything of the sort four or five years ago, I should have looked upon\r\nhim as incurably mad. And yet the madman would have been right. One\r\ncircumstance has followed on the heels of another, and everything\r\nhas turned out so entirely different from what I had imagined.\r\n\r\nOn December 14, 1911, five men stood at the southern end of our earth's\r\naxis, planted the Norwegian flag there, and named the region after\r\nthe man for whom they would all gladly have offered their lives --\r\nKing Haakon VII. Thus the veil was torn aside for all time, and one\r\nof the greatest of our earth's secrets had ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nSince I was one of the five who, on that December afternoon, took part\r\nin this unveiling, it has fallen to my lot to write -- the history\r\nof the South Pole.\r\n\r\nAntarctic exploration is very ancient. Even before our conception\r\nof the earth's form had taken definite shape, voyages to the South\r\nbegan. It is true that not many of the explorers of those distant times\r\nreached what we now understand by the Antarctic regions, but still\r\nthe intention and the possibility were there, and justify the name of\r\nAntarctic exploration. The motive force of these undertakings was --\r\nas has so often been the case -- the hope of gain. Rulers greedy of\r\npower saw in their mind's eye an increase of their possessions. Men\r\nthirsting for gold dreamed of an unsuspected wealth of the alluring\r\nmetal. Enthusiastic missionaries rejoiced at the thought of a multitude\r\nof lost sheep. The scientifically trained world waited modestly in\r\nthe background. But they have all had their share: politics, trade,\r\nreligion, and science.\r\n\r\nThe history of Antarctic discovery may be divided at the outset into\r\ntwo categories. In the first of these I would include the numerous\r\nvoyagers who, without any definite idea of the form or conditions of\r\nthe southern hemisphere, set their course toward the South, to make\r\nwhat landfall they could. These need only be mentioned briefly before\r\npassing to the second group, that of Antarctic travellers in the proper\r\nsense of the term, who, with a knowledge of the form of the earth,\r\nset out across the ocean, aiming to strike the Antarctic monster --\r\nin the heart, if fortune favoured them.\r\n\r\nWe must always remember with gratitude and admiration the first sailors\r\nwho steered their vessels through storms and mists, and increased our\r\nknowledge of the lands of ice in the South. People of the present day,\r\nwho are so well supplied with information about the most distant parts\r\nof the earth, and have all our modern means of communication at their\r\ncommand, find it difficult to understand the intrepid courage that\r\nis implied by the voyages of these men.\r\n\r\nThey shaped their course toward the dark unknown, constantly exposed\r\nto being engulfed and destroyed by the vague, mysterious dangers that\r\nlay in wait for them somewhere in that dim vastness.\r\n\r\nThe beginnings were small, but by degrees much was won. One stretch\r\nof country after another was discovered and subjected to the power of\r\nman. Knowledge of the appearance of our globe became ever greater and\r\ntook more definite shape. Our gratitude to these first discoverers\r\nshould be profound.\r\n\r\nAnd yet even to-day we hear people ask in surprise: What is the use\r\nof these voyages of exploration? What good do they do us? Little\r\nbrains, I always answer to myself, have only room for thoughts of\r\nbread and butter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first name on the roll of discovery is that of Prince Henry of\r\nPortugal, surnamed the Navigator, who is ever to be remembered as\r\nthe earliest promoter of geographical research. To his efforts was\r\ndue the first crossing of the Equator, about 1470.\r\n\r\nWith Bartholomew Diaz another great step in advance was made. Sailing\r\nfrom Lisbon in 1487, he reached Algoa Bay, and without doubt passed\r\nthe fortieth parallel on his southward voyage.\r\n\r\nVasco da Gama's voyage of 1497 is too well known to need\r\ndescription. After him came men like Cabral and Vespucci, who\r\nincreased our knowledge, and de Gonneville, who added to the romance\r\nof exploration.\r\n\r\nWe then meet with the greatest of the older explorers, Ferdinand\r\nMagellan, a Portuguese by birth, though sailing in the service of\r\nSpain. Setting out in 1519, he discovered the connection between the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific Oceans in the strait that bears his name. No one\r\nbefore him had penetrated so far South -- to about lat. 52deg. S. One\r\nof his ships, the Victoria, accomplished the first circumnavigation\r\nof the world, and thus established in the popular mind the fact that\r\nthe earth was really round. From that time the idea of the Antarctic\r\nregions assumed definite shape. There must be something in the South:\r\nwhether land or water the future was to determine.\r\n\r\nIn 1578 we come to the renowned English seaman, Sir Francis\r\nDrake. Though he was accounted a buccaneer, we owe him honour for the\r\ngeographical discoveries he made. He rounded Cape Horn and proved\r\nthat Tierra del Fuego was a great group of islands and not part of\r\nan Antarctic continent, as many had thought.\r\n\r\nThe Dutchman, Dirk Gerritsz, who took part in a plundering expedition\r\nto India in 1599 by way of the Straits of Magellan, is said to have\r\nbeen blown out of his course after passing the straits, and to have\r\nfound himself in lat. 64deg. S. under high land covered with snow. This\r\nhas been assumed to be the South Shetland Islands, but the account\r\nof the voyage is open to doubt.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century we have the discoveries of Tasman, and\r\ntowards its close English adventurers reported having reached high\r\nlatitudes in the South Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe English Astronomer Royal, Halley, undertook a scientific voyage to\r\nthe South in 1699 for the purpose of making magnetic observations, and\r\nmet with ice in 52deg. S., from which latitude he returned to the north.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman, Bouvet (1738), was the first to follow the southern\r\nice-pack for any considerable distance, and to bring reports of the\r\nimmense, flat-topped Antarctic icebergs.\r\n\r\nIn 1756 the Spanish trading-ship Leon came home and reported high,\r\nsnow-covered land in lat. 55deg. S. to the east of Cape Horn. The\r\nprobability is that this was what we now know by the name of\r\nSouth Georgia. The Frenchman, Marion-Dufresne, discovered, in\r\n1772, the Marion and Crozet Islands. In the same year Joseph de\r\nKerguelen-Tremarec -- another Frenchman -- reached Kerguelen Land.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the series of expeditions that I have thought it proper\r\nto class in the first group. \"Antarctica,\" the sixth continent itself,\r\nstill lay unseen and untrodden. But human courage and intelligence\r\nwere now actively stirred to lift the veil and reveal the many secrets\r\nthat were concealed within the Antarctic Circle.\r\n\r\nCaptain James Cook -- one of the boldest and most capable seamen\r\nthe world has known -- opens the series of Antarctic expeditions\r\nproperly so called. The British Admiralty sent him out with orders\r\nto discover the great southern continent, or prove that it did not\r\nexist. The expedition, consisting of two ships, the Resolution and\r\nthe Adventure, left Plymouth on July 13, 1772. After a short stay at\r\nMadeira it reached Cape Town on October 30. Here Cook received news of\r\nthe discovery of Kerguelen and of the Marion and Crozet Islands. In\r\nthe course of his voyage to the south Cook passed 300 miles to the\r\nsouth of the land reported by Bouvet, and thereby established the fact\r\nthat the land in question -- if it existed -- was not continuous with\r\nthe great southern continent.\r\n\r\nOn January 17, 1773, the Antarctic Circle was crossed for the first\r\ntime -- a memorable day in the annals of Antarctic exploration. Shortly\r\nafterwards a solid pack was encountered, and Cook was forced to return\r\nto the north. A course was laid for the newly discovered islands --\r\nKerguelen, Marion, and the Crozets -- and it was proved that they\r\nhad nothing to do with the great southern land. In the course of his\r\nfurther voyages in Antarctic waters Cook completed the most southerly\r\ncircumnavigation of the globe, and showed that there was no connection\r\nbetween any of the lands or islands that had been discovered and\r\nthe great mysterious \"Antarctica.\" His highest latitude (January 30,\r\n1774) was 71deg. 10' S.\r\n\r\nCook's voyages had important commercial results, as his reports of\r\nthe enormous number of seals round South Georgia brought many sealers,\r\nboth English and American, to those waters, and these sealers, in turn,\r\nincreased the field of geographical discovery.\r\n\r\nIn 1819 the discovery of the South Shetlands by the Englishman,\r\nCaptain William Smith, is to be recorded. And this discovery led to\r\nthat of the Palmer Archipelago to the south of them.\r\n\r\nThe next scientific expedition to the Antarctic regions was that\r\ndespatched by the Emperor Alexander I. of Russia, under the command\r\nof Captain Thaddeus von Bellingshausen. It was composed of two ships,\r\nand sailed from Cronstadt on July 15, 1819. To this expedition belongs\r\nthe honour of having discovered the first land to the south of the\r\nAntarctic Circle -- Peter I. Island and Alexander I. Land.\r\n\r\nThe next star in the Antarctic firmament is the British seaman, James\r\nWeddell. He made two voyages in a sealer of 160 tons, the Jane of\r\nLeith, in 1819 and 1822, being accompanied on the second occasion by\r\nthe cutter Beaufoy. In February, 1823, Weddell had the satisfaction\r\nof beating Cook's record by reaching a latitude of 74deg. 15' S. in the\r\nsea now known as Weddell Sea, which in that year was clear of ice.\r\n\r\nThe English firm of shipowners, Enderby Brothers, plays a not\r\nunimportant part in Antarctic exploration. The Enderbys had carried on\r\nsealing in southern waters since 1785. They were greatly interested,\r\nnot only in the commercial, but also in the scientific results of\r\nthese voyages, and chose their captains accordingly. In 1830 the\r\nfirm sent out John Biscoe on a sealing voyage in the Antarctic Ocean\r\nwith the brig Tula and the cutter Lively. The result of this voyage\r\nwas the sighting of Enderby Land in lat. 66deg. 25' S., long. 49deg. 18'\r\nE. In the following year Adelaide, Biscoe, and Pitt Islands, on the\r\nwest coast of Graham Land were charted, and Graham Land itself was\r\nseen for the first time.\r\n\r\nKemp, another of Enderby's skippers, reported land in lat. 66deg. S.,\r\nand about long. 60deg. E.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 yet another skipper of the same firm, John Balleny, in the\r\nschooner Eliza Scott, discovered the Balleny Islands.\r\n\r\nWe then come to the celebrated French sailor, Admiral Jules\r\nSebastien Dumont d'Urville. He left Toulon in September, 1837, with\r\na scientifically equipped expedition, in the ships Astrolabe and\r\nZelee. The intention was to follow in Weddell's track, and endeavour\r\nto carry the French flag still nearer to the Pole. Early in 1838 Louis\r\nPhilippe Land and Joinville Island were discovered and named. Two\r\nyears later we again find d'Urville's vessels in Antarctic waters,\r\nwith the object of investigating the magnetic conditions in the\r\nvicinity of the South Magnetic Pole. Land was discovered in lat. 66deg.\r\n30' S. and long. 138deg. 21' E. With the exception of a few bare islets,\r\nthe whole of this land was completely covered with snow. It was given\r\nthe name of Adelie Land, and a part of the ice-barrier lying to the\r\nwest of it was called C^ote Clarie, on the supposition that it must\r\nenvelop a line of coast.\r\n\r\nThe American naval officer, Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, sailed in\r\nAugust, 1838, with a fleet of six vessels. The expedition was sent out\r\nby Congress, and carried twelve scientific observers. In February,\r\n1839, the whole of this imposing Antarctic fleet was collected in\r\nOrange Harbour in the south of Tierra del Fuego, where the work\r\nwas divided among the various vessels. As to the results of this\r\nexpedition it is difficult to express an opinion. Certain it is\r\nthat Wilkes Land has subsequently been sailed over in many places\r\nby several expeditions. Of what may have been the cause of this\r\ninaccurate cartography it is impossible to form any opinion. It\r\nappears, however, from the account of the whole voyage, that the\r\nundertaking was seriously conducted.\r\n\r\nThen the bright star appears -- the man whose name will ever be\r\nremembered as one of the most intrepid polar explorers and one of\r\nthe most capable seamen the world has produced -- Admiral Sir James\r\nClark Ross.\r\n\r\nThe results of his expedition are well known. Ross himself commanded\r\nthe Erebus and Commander Francis Crozier the Terror. The former\r\nvessel, of 370 tons, had been originally built for throwing bombs;\r\nher construction was therefore extraordinarily solid. The Terror,\r\n340 tons, had been previously employed in Arctic waters, and on this\r\naccount had been already strengthened. In provisioning the ships,\r\nevery possible precaution was taken against scurvy, with the dangers\r\nof which Ross was familiar from his experience in Arctic waters.\r\n\r\nThe vessels sailed from England in September, 1839, calling at\r\nmany of the Atlantic Islands, and arrived in Christmas Harbour,\r\nKerguelen Land, in the following May. Here they stayed two months,\r\nmaking magnetic observations, and then proceeded to Hobart.\r\n\r\nSir John Franklin, the eminent polar explorer, was at that time\r\nGovernor of Tasmania, and Ross could not have wished for a better\r\none. Interested as Franklin naturally was in the expedition, he\r\nafforded it all the help he possibly could. During his stay in Tasmania\r\nRoss received information of what had been accomplished by Wilkes and\r\nDumont d'Urville in the very region which the Admiralty had sent him\r\nto explore. The effect of this news was that Ross changed his plans,\r\nand decided to proceed along the 170th meridian E., and if possible\r\nto reach the Magnetic Pole from the eastward.\r\n\r\nHere was another fortuitous circumstance in the long chain of\r\nevents. If Ross had not received this intelligence, it is quite\r\npossible that the epoch-making geographical discoveries associated\r\nwith his name would have been delayed for many years.\r\n\r\nOn November 12, 1840, Sir John Franklin went on board the Erebus\r\nto accompany his friend Ross out of port. Strange are the ways of\r\nlife! There stood Franklin on the deck of the ship which a few years\r\nlater was to be his deathbed. Little did he suspect, as he sailed\r\nout of Hobart through Storm Bay -- the bay that is now wreathed by\r\nthe flourishing orchards of Tasmania -- that he would meet his death\r\nin a high northern latitude on board the same vessel, in storms and\r\nfrost. But so it was.\r\n\r\nAfter calling at the Auckland Islands and at Campbell Island, Ross\r\nagain steered for the South, and the Antarctic Circle was crossed on\r\nNew Year's Day, 1841. The ships were now faced by the ice-pack, but\r\nto Ross this was not the dangerous enemy it had appeared to earlier\r\nexplorers with their more weakly constructed vessels. Ross plunged\r\nboldly into the pack with his fortified ships, and, taking advantage\r\nof the narrow leads, he came out four days later, after many severe\r\nbuffets, into the open sea to the South.\r\n\r\nRoss had reached the sea now named after him, and the boldest voyage\r\nknown in Antarctic exploration was accomplished.\r\n\r\nFew people of the present day are capable of rightly appreciating this\r\nheroic deed; this brilliant proof of human courage and energy. With\r\ntwo ponderous craft -- regular \"tubs\" according to our ideas -- these\r\nmen sailed right into the heart of the pack, which all previous polar\r\nexplorers had regarded as certain death. It is not merely difficult\r\nto grasp this; it is simply impossible -- to us, who with a motion\r\nof the hand can set the screw going, and wriggle out of the first\r\ndifficulty we encounter. These men were heroes -- heroes in the\r\nhighest sense of the word.\r\n\r\nIt was in lat. 69deg. 15' S. and long. 176deg. 15' E. that Ross found the\r\nopen sea. On the following day the horizon was perfectly clear of\r\nice. What joy that man must have felt when he saw that he had a clear\r\nway to the South!\r\n\r\nThe course was set for the Magnetic Pole, and the hope of soon reaching\r\nit burned in the hearts of all. Then -- just as they had accustomed\r\nthemselves to the idea of open sea, perhaps to the Magnetic Pole\r\nitself -- the crow's-nest reported \"High land right ahead.\" This was\r\nthe mountainous coast of South Victoria Land.\r\n\r\nWhat a fairyland this must have seemed to the first voyagers who\r\napproached it! Mighty mountain-ranges with summits from 7,000 to\r\n10,000 feet high, some covered with snow and some quite bare --\r\nlofty and rugged, precipitous and wild.\r\n\r\nIt became apparent that the Magnetic Pole was some 500 miles distant\r\n-- far inland, behind the snow-covered ridges. On the morning of\r\nJanuary 12 they came close under a little island, and Ross with a\r\nfew companions rowed ashore and took possession of the country. They\r\ncould not reach the mainland itself on account of the thick belt of\r\nice that lay along the coast.\r\n\r\nThe expedition continued to work its way southward, making fresh\r\ndiscoveries. On January 28 the two lofty summits, Mount Erebus and\r\nMount Terror, were sighted for the first time. The former was seen to\r\nbe an active volcano, from which smoke and flames shot up into the\r\nsky. It must have been a wonderfully fine sight, this flaming fire\r\nin the midst of the white, frozen landscape. Captain Scott has since\r\ngiven the island, on which the mountains lie, the name of Ross Island,\r\nafter the intrepid navigator.\r\n\r\nNaturally there were great expectations on board. If they had\r\npenetrated so far south, there might be no limit to their further\r\nprogress. But, as had happened so many times before, their hopes were\r\ndisappointed. From Ross Island, as far to the eastward as the eye\r\ncould see, there extended a lofty, impenetrable wall of ice. To sail\r\nthrough it was as impossible as sailing through the cliffs of Dover,\r\nRoss says in his description. All they could do was to try to get\r\nround it. And then began the first examination of that part of the\r\ngreat Antarctic Barrier which has since been named the Ross Barrier.\r\n\r\nThe wall of ice was followed to the eastward for a distance of 250\r\nmiles. Its upper surface was seen to be perfectly flat. The most\r\neasterly point reached was long. 167deg. W., and the highest latitude\r\n78deg. 4' S. No opening having been found, the ships returned to the\r\nwest, in order to try once more whether there was any possibility of\r\nreaching the Magnetic Pole. But this attempt soon had to be abandoned\r\non account of the lateness of the season, and in April, 1841, Ross\r\nreturned to Hobart.\r\n\r\nHis second voyage was full of dangers and thrilling incidents, but\r\nadded little to the tale of his discoveries.\r\n\r\nOn February 22, 1842, the ships came in sight of the Barrier, and,\r\nfollowing it to the east, found that it turned north-eastward. Here\r\nRoss recorded an \"appearance of land\" in the very region in which\r\nCaptain Scott, sixty years later, discovered King Edward VII. Land.\r\n\r\nOn December 17, 1842, Ross set out on his third and last Antarctic\r\nvoyage. His object this time was to reach a high latitude along\r\nthe coast of Louis Philippe Land, if possible, or alternatively\r\nby following Weddell's track. Both attempts were frustrated by the\r\nice conditions.\r\n\r\nOn sighting Joinville Land, the officers of the Terror thought they\r\ncould see smoke from active volcanoes, but Ross and his men did not\r\nconfirm this. About fifty years later active volcanoes were actually\r\ndiscovered by the Norwegian, Captain C. A. Larsen, in the Jason. A\r\nfew minor geographical discoveries were made, but none of any great\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThis concluded Ross's attempts to reach the South Pole. A magnificent\r\nwork had been achieved, and the honour of having opened up the way\r\nby which, at last, the Pole was reached must be ascribed to Ross.\r\n\r\nThe Pagoda, commanded by Lieutenant Moore, was the next vessel to make\r\nfor the South. Her chief object was to make magnetic observations in\r\nhigh latitudes south of the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe first ice was met with in lat. 53deg. 30' S., on January 25,1845. On\r\nFebruary 5 the Antarctic Circle was crossed in long. 30deg. 45' E. The\r\nmost southerly latitude attained on this voyage was 67deg. 50', in\r\nlong. 39deg.41' E.\r\n\r\nThis was the last expedition to visit the Antarctic regions in a ship\r\npropelled by sails alone.\r\n\r\nThe next great event in the history of the southern seas is the\r\nChallenger expedition. This was an entirely scientific expedition,\r\nsplendidly equipped and conducted.\r\n\r\nThe achievements of this expedition are, however, so well known over\r\nthe whole civilized world that I do not think it necessary to dwell\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\n\r\nLess known, but no less efficient in their work, were the whalers\r\nround the South Shetlands and in the regions to the south of them. The\r\ndays of sailing-ships were now past, and vessels with auxiliary steam\r\nappear on the scene.\r\n\r\nBefore passing on to these, I must briefly mention a man who throughout\r\nhis life insisted on the necessity and utility of Antarctic expeditions\r\n-- Professor Georg von Neumayer.\r\n\r\nNever has Antarctic research had a warmer, nobler, and more high-minded\r\nchampion. So long as \"Antarctica\" endures, the name of Neumayer will\r\nalways be connected with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe steam whaler Gronland left Hamburg on July 22, 1872, in command\r\nof Captain Eduard Dallmann, bound for the South Shetlands. Many\r\ninteresting geographical discoveries were made on this voyage.\r\n\r\nAmongst other whalers may be mentioned the Balaena, the Diana, the\r\nActive, and the Polar Star of Dundee.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 the whole of this fleet stood to the South to hunt for\r\nwhales in the vicinity of the South Shetlands. They each brought home\r\nwith them some fresh piece of information. On board the Balaena was\r\nDr. William S. Bruce. This is the first time we meet with him on his\r\nway to the South, but it was not to be the last.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the Scottish whaling fleet, the Norwegian whaling\r\ncaptain, C. A. Larsen, appears in the regions to the south of the\r\nSouth Shetlands. It is not too much to say of Captain Larsen that\r\nof all those who have visited the Antarctic regions in search of\r\nwhales, he has unquestionably brought home the best and most abundant\r\nscientific results. To him we owe the discovery of large stretches\r\nof the east coast of Graham Land, King Oscar II. Land, Foyn's Land,\r\netc. He brought us news of two active volcanoes, and many groups of\r\nislands. But perhaps the greatest interest attaches to the fossils\r\nhe brought home from Seymour Island -- the first to be obtained from\r\nthe Antarctic regions.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1894, Captain Evensen in the Hertha succeeded in\r\napproaching nearer to Alexander I. Land than either Bellingshausen\r\nor Biscoe. But the search for whales claimed his attention, and he\r\nconsidered it his duty to devote himself to that before anything else.\r\n\r\nA grand opportunity was lost: there can be no doubt that, if Captain\r\nEvensen had been free, he would here have had a chance of achieving\r\neven better work than he did -- bold, capable, and enterprising as\r\nhe is.\r\n\r\nThe next whaling expedition to make its mark in the South Polar regions\r\nis that of the Antarctic, under Captain Leonard Kristensen. Kristensen\r\nwas an extraordinarily capable man, and achieved the remarkable record\r\nof being the first to set foot on the sixth continent, the great\r\nsouthern land -- \"Antarctica.\" This was at Cape Adare, Victoria Land,\r\nin January, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn epoch-making phase of Antarctic research is now ushered in by the\r\nBelgian expedition in the Belgica, under the leadership of Commander\r\nAdrien de Gerlache. Hardly anyone has had a harder fight to set his\r\nenterprise on foot than Gerlache. He was successful, however, and on\r\nAugust 16, 1897, the Belgica left Antwerp.\r\n\r\nThe scientific staff had been chosen with great care, and Gerlache\r\nhad been able to secure the services of exceedingly able men. His\r\nsecond in command, Lieutenant G. Lecointe, a Belgian, possessed every\r\nqualification for his difficult position. It must be remembered that\r\nthe Belgica's company was as cosmopolitan as it could be -- Belgians,\r\nFrenchmen, Americans, Norwegians, Swedes, Rumanians, Poles, etc. --\r\nand it was the business of the second in command to keep all these\r\nmen together and get the best possible work out of them. And Lecointe\r\nacquitted himself admirably; amiable and firm, he secured the respect\r\nof all.\r\n\r\nAs a navigator and astronomer he was unsurpassable, and when he\r\nafterwards took over the magnetic work he rendered great services in\r\nthis department also. Lecointe will always be remembered as one of\r\nthe main supports of this expedition.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Emile Danco, another Belgian, was the physicist of the\r\nexpedition. Unfortunately this gifted young man died at an early\r\nstage of the voyage -- a sad loss to the expedition. The magnetic\r\nobservations were then taken over by Lecointe.\r\n\r\nThe biologist was the Rumanian, Emile Racovitza. The immense mass\r\nof material Racovitza brought home speaks better than I can for his\r\nability. Besides a keen interest in his work, he possessed qualities\r\nwhich made him the most agreeable and interesting of companions.\r\n\r\nHenryk Arctowski and Antoine Dobrowolski were both Poles. Their share\r\nof the work was the sky and the sea; they carried out oceanographical\r\nand meteorological observations.\r\n\r\nHenry Arctowski was also the geologist of the expedition -- an\r\nall-round man. It was a strenuous task he had, that of constantly\r\nwatching wind and weather. Conscientious as he was, he never let slip\r\nan opportunity of adding to the scientific results of the voyage.\r\n\r\nFrederick A. Cook, of Brooklyn, was surgeon to the expedition\r\n-- beloved and respected by all. As a medical man, his calm and\r\nconvincing presence had an excellent effect. As things turned out,\r\nthe greatest responsibility fell upon Cook, but he mastered the\r\nsituation in a wonderful way. Through his practical qualities he\r\nfinally became indispensable. It cannot be denied that the Belgian\r\nAntarctic expedition owes a great debt to Cook.\r\n\r\nThe object of the expedition was to penetrate to the South Magnetic\r\nPole, but this had to be abandoned at an early stage for want of time.\r\n\r\nA somewhat long stay in the interesting channels of Tierra del Fuego\r\ndelayed their departure till January 13, 1898. On that date the\r\nBelgica left Staten Island and stood to the South.\r\n\r\nAn interesting series of soundings was made between Cape Horn and the\r\nSouth Shetlands. As these waters had not previously been investigated,\r\nthese soundings were, of course, of great importance.\r\n\r\nThe principal work of the expedition, from a geographical point of\r\nview, was carried out on the north coast of Graham Land.\r\n\r\nA large channel running to the south-west was discovered, dividing a\r\npart of Palmer Land from the mainland -- Danco's Land. The strait was\r\nafterwards named by the Belgian authorities \"Gerlache Strait.\" Three\r\nweeks were spent in charting it and making scientific observations. An\r\nexcellent collection of material was made.\r\n\r\nThis work was completed by February 12, and the Belgica left Gerlache\r\nStrait southward along the coast of Graham Land, at a date when all\r\nprevious expeditions had been in a hurry to turn their faces homeward.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th the Antarctic Circle was crossed on a south-westerly\r\ncourse. Next day they sighted Alexander Land, but could not approach\r\nnearer to it than twenty miles on account of impenetrable pack-ice.\r\n\r\nOn February 28 they had reached lat. 70deg. 20' S. and long. 85deg. W. Then a\r\nbreeze from the north sprang up and opened large channels in the ice,\r\nleading southward. They turned to the south, and plunged at haphazard\r\ninto the Antarctic floes.\r\n\r\nOn March 3 they reached lat. 70deg. 30' S., where all further progress\r\nwas hopeless. An attempt to get out again was in vain -- they were\r\ncaught in the trap. They then had to make the best of it.\r\n\r\nMany have been disposed to blame Gerlache for having gone into the ice,\r\nbadly equipped as he was, at a time of year when he ought rather to\r\nhave been making his way out, and they may be right. But let us look\r\nat the question from the other side as well.\r\n\r\nAfter years of effort he had at last succeeded in getting the\r\nexpedition away. Gerlache knew for a certainty that unless he returned\r\nwith results that would please the public, he might just as well never\r\nreturn at all. Then the thickly packed ice opened, and long channels\r\nappeared, leading as far southward as the eye could reach. Who could\r\ntell? Perhaps they led to the Pole itself. There was little to lose,\r\nmuch to gain; he decided to risk it.\r\n\r\nOf course, it was not right, but we can easily understand it.\r\n\r\nThe Belgica now had thirteen long months before her. Preparations\r\nwere commenced at once for the winter. As many seals and penguins as\r\ncould be found were shot, and placed in store.\r\n\r\nThe scientific staff was constantly active, and brilliant\r\noceanographical, meteorological, and magnetic work was accomplished.\r\n\r\nOn May 17 the sun disappeared, not to be seen again for seventy\r\ndays. The first Antarctic night had begun. What would it bring? The\r\nBelgica was not fitted for wintering in the ice. For one thing,\r\npersonal equipment was insufficient. They had to do the best they\r\ncould by making clothes out of blankets, and the most extraordinary\r\ndevices were contrived in the course of the winter. Necessity is the\r\nmother of invention.\r\n\r\nOn June 5 Danco died of heart-failure.\r\n\r\nOn the same day they had a narrow escape of being squeezed in the\r\nice. Fortunately the enormous block of ice passed under the vessel\r\nand lifted her up without doing her any damage. Otherwise, the first\r\npart of the winter passed off well.\r\n\r\nAfterwards sickness appeared, and threatened the most serious danger\r\nto the expedition -- scurvy and insanity. One of them by itself would\r\nhave been bad enough. Scurvy especially increased, and did such havoc\r\nthat finally there was not a single man who escaped being attacked\r\nby this fearful disease.\r\n\r\nCook's behaviour at this time won the respect and devotion of\r\nall. It is not too much to say that Cook was the most popular man\r\nof the expedition, and he deserved it. From morning to night he\r\nwas occupied with his many patients, and when the sun returned it\r\nhappened not infrequently that, after a strenuous day's work, the\r\ndoctor sacrificed his night's sleep to go hunting seals and penguins,\r\nin order to provide the fresh meat that was so greatly needed by all.\r\n\r\nOn July 22 the sun returned.\r\n\r\nIt was not a pleasant sight that it shone upon. The Antarctic winter\r\nhad set its mark upon all, and green, wasted faces stared at the\r\nreturning light.\r\n\r\nTime went on, and the summer arrived. They waited day by day to see a\r\nchange in the ice. But no; the ice they had entered so light-heartedly\r\nwas not to be so easy to get out of again.\r\n\r\nNew Year's Day came and went without any change in the ice.\r\n\r\nThe situation now began to be seriously threatening. Another winter\r\nin the ice would mean death and destruction on a large scale. Disease\r\nand insufficient nourishment would soon make an end of most of the\r\nship's company.\r\n\r\nAgain Cook came to the aid of the expedition.\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with Racovitza he had thought out a very ingenious way\r\nof sawing a channel, and thus reaching the nearest lead. The proposal\r\nwas submitted to the leader of the expedition and accepted by him;\r\nboth the plan and the method of carrying it out were well considered.\r\n\r\nAfter three weeks' hard work, day and night, they at last reached\r\nthe lead.\r\n\r\nCook was incontestably the leading spirit in this work, and gained\r\nsuch honour among the members of the expedition that I think it just\r\nto mention it. Upright, honourable, capable, and conscientious in\r\nthe extreme -- such is the memory we retain of Frederick A. Cook from\r\nthose days.\r\n\r\nLittle did his comrades suspect that a few years later he would be\r\nregarded as one of the greatest humbugs the world has ever seen. This\r\nis a psychological enigma well worth studying to those who care to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the Belgica was not yet clear of the ice. After having worked\r\nher way out into the lead and a little way on, she was stopped by\r\nabsolutely close pack, within sight of the open sea.\r\n\r\nFor a whole month the expedition lay here, reaping the same experiences\r\nas Ross on his second voyage with the Erebus and Terror. The immense\r\nseas raised the heavy ice high in the air, and flung it against the\r\nsides of the vessel. That month was a hell upon earth. Strangely\r\nenough, the Belgica escaped undamaged, and steamed into Punta Arenas\r\nin the Straits of Magellan on March 28, 1899.\r\n\r\nModern scientific Antarctic exploration had now been initiated,\r\nand de Gerlache had won his place for all time in the first rank of\r\nAntarctic explorers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Belgica was trying her hardest to get out of the ice,\r\nanother vessel was making equally strenuous efforts to get in. This\r\nwas the Southern Cross, the ship of the English expedition, under the\r\nleadership of Carstens Borchgrevink. This expedition's field of work\r\nlay on the opposite side of the Pole, in Ross's footsteps.\r\n\r\nOn February 11, 1899, the Southern Cross entered Ross Sea in lat. 70deg.\r\nS. and long. 174deg. E., nearly sixty years after Ross had left it.\r\n\r\nA party was landed at Cape Adare, where it wintered. The ship wintered\r\nin New Zealand.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1900, the land party was taken off, and an examination\r\nof the Barrier was carried out with the vessel. This expedition\r\nsucceeded for the first time in ascending the Barrier, which from\r\nRoss's day had been looked upon as inaccessible. The Barrier formed\r\na little bight at the spot where the landing was made, and the ice\r\nsloped gradually down to the sea.\r\n\r\nWe must acknowledge that by ascending the Barrier, Borchgrevink\r\nopened a way to the south, and threw aside the greatest obstacle\r\nto the expeditions that followed. The Southern Cross returned to\r\ncivilization in March, 1900.\r\n\r\nThe Valdivia's expedition, under Professor Chun, of Leipzig, must\r\nbe mentioned, though in our day it can hardly be regarded as an\r\nAntarctic expedition. On this voyage the position of Bouvet Island\r\nwas established once for all as lat. 54deg. 26' S., long. 3deg. 24' E.\r\n\r\nThe ice was followed from long. 8deg. E. to 58deg. E., as closely as the\r\nvessel could venture to approach. Abundance of oceanographical material\r\nwas brought home.\r\n\r\nAntarctic exploration now shoots rapidly ahead, and the twentieth\r\ncentury opens with the splendidly equipped British and German\r\nexpeditions in the Discovery and the Gauss, both national undertakings.\r\n\r\nCaptain Robert F. Scott was given command of the Discovery's\r\nexpedition, and it could not have been placed in better hands.\r\n\r\nThe second in command was Lieutenant Armitage, who had taken part in\r\nthe Jackson-Harmsworth North Polar expedition.\r\n\r\nThe other officers were Royds, Barne, and Shackleton.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Skelton was chief engineer and photographer to the\r\nexpedition. Two surgeons were on board -- Dr. Koettlitz, a former\r\nmember of the Jackson-Harmsworth expedition, and Dr. Wilson. The latter\r\nwas also the artist of the expedition. Bernacchi was the physicist,\r\nHodgson the biologist, and Ferrar the geologist.\r\n\r\nOn August 6, 1901, the expedition left Cowes, and arrived at Simon's\r\nBay on October 3. On the 14th it sailed again for New Zealand.\r\n\r\nThe official plan was to determine as accurately as possible the\r\nnature and extent of the South Polar lands that might be found, and\r\nto make a magnetic survey. It was left to the leader of the expedition\r\nto decide whether it should winter in the ice.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged beforehand that a relief ship should visit and\r\ncommunicate with the expedition in the following year.\r\n\r\nThe first ice was met with in the neighbourhood of the Antarctic\r\nCircle on January 1, 1902, and a few days later the open Ross Sea\r\nwas reached. After several landings had been made at Cape Adare and\r\nother points, the Discovery made a very interesting examination of\r\nthe Barrier to the eastward. At this part of the voyage King Edward\r\nVII. Land was discovered, but the thick ice-floes prevented the\r\nexpedition from landing. On the way back the ship entered the same\r\nbight that Borchgrevink had visited in 1900, and a balloon ascent\r\nwas made on the Barrier. The bay was called Balloon Inlet.\r\n\r\nFrom here the ship returned to McMurdo Bay, so named by Ross. Here\r\nthe Discovery wintered, in a far higher latitude than any previous\r\nexpedition. In the course of the autumn it was discovered that the\r\nland on which the expedition had its winter quarters was an island,\r\nseparated from the mainland by McMurdo Sound. It was given the name\r\nof Ross Island.\r\n\r\nSledge journeys began with the spring. Depots were laid down, and\r\nthe final march to the South was begun on November 2, 1902, by Scott,\r\nShackleton, and Wilson.\r\n\r\nThey had nineteen dogs to begin with. On November 27 they passed the\r\n80th parallel. Owing to the nature of the ground their progress was\r\nnot rapid; the highest latitude was reached on December 30 -- 82deg.\r\n17' S. New land was discovered -- a continuation of South Victoria\r\nLand. One summit after another rose higher and higher to the south.\r\n\r\nThe return journey was a difficult one. The dogs succumbed one after\r\nanother, and the men themselves had to draw the sledges. It went\r\nwell enough so long as all were in health; but suddenly Shackleton\r\nwas incapacitated by scurvy, and there were only two left to pull\r\nthe sledges.\r\n\r\nOn February 3 they reached the ship again, after an absence of\r\nninety-three days.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Armitage and Skelton had reached, for the first time in\r\nhistory, the high Antarctic inland plateau at an altitude of 9,000\r\nfeet above the sea.\r\n\r\nThe relief ship Morning had left Lyttelton on December 9. On her way\r\nsouth Scott Island was discovered, and on January 25 the Discovery's\r\nmasts were seen. But McMurdo Sound lay icebound all that year, and\r\nthe Morning returned home on March 3.\r\n\r\nThe expedition passed a second winter in the ice, and in the following\r\nspring Captain Scott led a sledge journey to the west on the ice\r\nplateau. In January, 1904, the Morning returned, accompanied by the\r\nTerra Nova, formerly a Newfoundland sealing vessel. They brought\r\norders from home that the Discovery was to be abandoned if she could\r\nnot be got out. Preparations were made for carrying out the order,\r\nbut finally, after explosives had been used, a sudden break-up of\r\nthe ice set the vessel free.\r\n\r\nAll the coal that could be spared was put on board the Discovery from\r\nthe relief ships, and Scott carried his researches further. If at that\r\ntime he had had more coal, it is probable that this active explorer\r\nwould have accomplished even greater things than he did. Wilkes's\r\n\"Ringgold's Knoll\" and \"Eld's Peak\" were wiped off the map, and\r\nnothing was seen of \"Cape Hudson,\" though the Discovery passed well\r\nwithin sight of its supposed position.\r\n\r\nOn March 14 Scott anchored in Ross Harbour, Auckland Islands. With\r\nrich results, the expedition returned home in September, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the German expedition under Professor Erich von Drygalski\r\nhad been doing excellent work in another quarter.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the expedition was to explore the Antarctic regions to\r\nthe south of Kerguelen Land, after having first built a station on\r\nthat island and landed a scientific staff, who were to work there,\r\nwhile the main expedition proceeded into the ice. Its ship, the Gauss,\r\nhad been built at Kiel with the Fram as a model.\r\n\r\nThe Gauss's navigator was Captain Hans Ruser, a skilful seaman of\r\nthe Hamburg-American line.\r\n\r\nDrygalski had chosen his scientific staff with knowledge and care,\r\nand it is certain that he could not have obtained better assistants.\r\n\r\nThe expedition left Kiel on August 11, 1901, bound for Cape Town. An\r\nextraordinarily complete oceanographical, meteorological, and magnetic\r\nsurvey was made during this part of the voyage.\r\n\r\nAfter visiting the Crozet Islands, the Gauss anchored in Royal Sound,\r\nKerguelen Land, on December 31. The expedition stayed here a month,\r\nand then steered for the south to explore the regions between Kemp\r\nLand and Knox Land. They had already encountered a number of bergs\r\nin lat. 60deg. S.\r\n\r\nOn February 14 they made a sounding of 1,730 fathoms near the supposed\r\nposition of Wilkes's Termination Land. Progress was very slow hereabout\r\non account of the thick floes.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, on February 19, they had a sounding of 132 fathoms, and on\r\nthe morning of February 21 land was sighted, entirely covered with\r\nice and snow. A violent storm took the Gauss by surprise, collected\r\na mass of icebergs around her, and filled up the intervening space\r\nwith floes, so that there could be no question of making any way. They\r\nhad to swallow the bitter pill, and prepare to spend the winter where\r\nthey were.\r\n\r\nObservatories were built of ice, and sledge journeys were undertaken as\r\nsoon as the surface permitted. They reached land in three and a half\r\ndays, and there discovered a bare mountain, about 1,000 feet high,\r\nfifty miles from the ship. The land was named Kaiser Wilhelm II. Land,\r\nand the mountain the Gaussberg.\r\n\r\nThey occupied the winter in observations of every possible kind. The\r\nweather was extremely stormy and severe, but their winter harbour,\r\nunder the lee of great stranded bergs, proved to be a good one. They\r\nwere never once exposed to unpleasant surprises.\r\n\r\nOn February 8, 1903, the Gauss was able to begin to move again. From\r\nthe time she reached the open sea until her arrival at Cape Town on\r\nJune 9, scientific observations were continued.\r\n\r\nHigh land had been seen to the eastward on the bearing of Wilkes's\r\nTermination Land, and an amount of scientific work had been\r\naccomplished of which the German nation may well be proud. Few\r\nAntarctic expeditions have had such a thoroughly scientific equipment\r\nas that of the Gauss, both as regards appliances and personnel.\r\n\r\nThe Swedish Antarctic expedition under Dr. Otto Nordenskjold left\r\nGothenburg on October 16, 1901, in the Antarctic, commanded by Captain\r\nC. A. Larsen, already mentioned. The scientific staff was composed\r\nof nine specialists.\r\n\r\nAfter calling at the Falkland Islands and Staten Island, a course was\r\nmade for the South Shetlands, which came in sight on January 10, 1902.\r\n\r\nAfter exploring the coast of Louis Philippe Land, the ship visited\r\nWeddell Sea in the hope of getting southward along King Oscar II. Land,\r\nbut the ice conditions were difficult, and it was impossible to reach\r\nthe coast.\r\n\r\nNordenskjold and five men were then landed on Snow Hill Island, with\r\nmaterials for an observatory and winter quarters and the necessary\r\nprovisions. The ship continued her course northward to the open sea.\r\n\r\nThe first winter on Snow Hill Island was unusually stormy and cold, but\r\nduring the spring several interesting sledge journeys were made. When\r\nsummer arrived the Antarctic did not appear, and the land party were\r\nobliged to prepare for a second winter. In the following spring,\r\nOctober, 1903, Nordenskjold made a sledge journey to explore the\r\nneighbourhood of Mount Haddington, and a closer examination showed\r\nthat the mountain lay on an island. In attempting to work round this\r\nisland, he one day stumbled upon three figures, doubtfully human,\r\nwhich might at first sight have been taken for some of our African\r\nbrethren straying thus far to the south.\r\n\r\nIt took Nordenskjold a long time to recognize in these beings\r\nDr. Gunnar Andersson, Lieutenant Duse, and their companion during\r\nthe winter, a Norwegian sailor named Grunden.\r\n\r\nThe way it came about was this. The Antarctic had made repeated\r\nattempts to reach the winter station, but the state of the ice was\r\nbad, and they had to give up the idea of getting through. Andersson,\r\nDuse and Grunden were then landed in the vicinity, to bring news\r\nto the winter quarters as soon as the ice permitted them to arrive\r\nthere. They had been obliged to build themselves a stone hut, in\r\nwhich they had passed the winter.\r\n\r\nThis experience is one of the most interesting one can read of\r\nin the history of the Polar regions. Badly equipped as they were,\r\nthey had to have recourse, like Robinson Crusoe, to their inventive\r\nfaculties. The most extraordinary contrivances were devised in the\r\ncourse of the winter, and when spring came the three men stepped out\r\nof their hole, well and hearty, ready to tackle their work.\r\n\r\nThis was such a remarkable feat that everyone who has some knowledge\r\nof Polar conditions must yield them his admiration. But there is more\r\nto tell.\r\n\r\nOn November 8, when both parties were united at Snow Hill, they\r\nwere unexpectedly joined by Captain Irizar, of the Argentine gunboat\r\nUruguay, and one of his officers. Some anxiety had been felt owing to\r\nthe absence of news of the Antarctic, and the Argentine Government\r\nhad sent the Uruguay to the South to search for the expedition. But\r\nwhat in the world had become of Captain Larsen and the Antarctic? This\r\nwas the question the others asked themselves.\r\n\r\nThe same night  --  it sounds almost incredible  --  there was a knock\r\nat the door of the hut, and in walked Captain Larsen with five of his\r\nmen. They brought the sad intelligence that the good ship Antarctic\r\nwas no more. The crew had saved themselves on the nearest island,\r\nwhile the vessel sank, severely damaged by ice.\r\n\r\nThey, too, had had to build themselves a stone hut and get through the\r\nwinter as best they could. They certainly did not have an easy time,\r\nand I can imagine that the responsibility weighed heavily on him who\r\nhad to bear it. One man died; the others came through it well.\r\n\r\nMuch of the excellent material collected by the expedition was lost\r\nby the sinking of the Antarctic, but a good deal was brought home.\r\n\r\nBoth from a scientific and from a popular point of view this expedition\r\nmay be considered one of the most interesting the South Polar regions\r\nhave to show.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe then come to the Scotsman, Dr. William S. Bruce, in the Scotia.\r\n\r\nWe have met with Bruce before: first in the Balaena in 1892, and\r\nafterwards with Mr. Andrew Coats in Spitzbergen. The latter voyage\r\nwas a fortunate one for Bruce, as it provided him with the means of\r\nfitting out his expedition in the Scotia to Antarctic waters.\r\n\r\nThe vessel left the Clyde on November 2,1902, under the command of\r\nCaptain Thomas Robertson, of Dundee. Bruce had secured the assistance\r\nof Mossman, Rudmose Brown and Dr. Pirie for the scientific work. In\r\nthe following February the Antarctic Circle was crossed, and on the\r\n22nd of that month the ship was brought to a standstill in lat. 70deg.\r\n25' S. The winter was spent at Laurie Island, one of the South Orkneys.\r\n\r\nReturning to the south, the Scotia reached, in March, 1904, lat. 74deg. 1'\r\nS., long. 22deg. W., where the sea rapidly shoaled to 159 fathoms. Further\r\nprogress was impossible owing to ice. Hilly country was sighted beyond\r\nthe barrier, and named \"Coats Land,\" after Bruce's chief supporters.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the foremost rank of the Antarctic explorers of our time stands\r\nthe French savant and yachtsman, Dr. Jean Charcot. In the course of\r\nhis two expeditions of 1903 -- 1905 and 1908 -- 1910 he succeeded in\r\nopening up a large extent of the unknown continent. We owe to him\r\na closer acquaintance with Alexander I. Land, and the discovery of\r\nLoubet, Fallieres and Charcot Lands is also his work.\r\n\r\nHis expeditions were splendidly equipped, and the scientific results\r\nwere extraordinarily rich. The point that compels our special\r\nadmiration in Charcot's voyages is that he chose one of the most\r\ndifficult fields of the Antarctic zone to work in. The ice conditions\r\nhere are extremely unfavourable, and navigation in the highest degree\r\nrisky. A coast full of submerged reefs and a sea strewn with icebergs\r\nwas what the Frenchmen had to contend with. The exploration of such\r\nregions demands capable men and stout vessels.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Ernest Shackleton! -- the name has a brisk sound. At its mere\r\nmention we see before us a man of indomitable will and boundless\r\ncourage. He has shown us what the will and energy of a single man\r\ncan perform. He gained his first experience of Antarctic exploration\r\nas a member of the British expedition in the Discovery, under Captain\r\nScott. It was a good school. Scott, Wilson, and Shackleton, formed the\r\nsouthern party, with the highest latitude as their goal. They reached\r\n82deg. 17' S. -- a great record at that time. Being attacked by scurvy,\r\nShackleton had to go home at the first opportunity.\r\n\r\nShortly after his return Shackleton began to make active\r\npreparations. Few people had any faith in Shackleton. Wasn't it\r\nhe who was sent home from the Discovery after the first year? What\r\ndoes he want to go out for again? He has shown well enough that he\r\ncan't stand the work! Shackleton had a hard struggle to find the\r\nnecessary funds. He left England unheeded and loaded with debts in\r\nAugust, 1907, on board the Nimrod, bound for the South Pole. With\r\nsurprising frankness he declared his intention of trying to reach the\r\nPole itself. So far as I know, he was the first who ventured to say\r\nstraight out that the Pole was his object. This hearty frankness was\r\nthe first thing that struck me, and made me look more closely at the\r\nman. Later on I followed his steps with the greatest interest. The\r\nexpedition, unnoticed when it left England, was soon forgotten. At\r\nmost, people connected the name of Shackleton with the rank of\r\n\"Lieutenant R.N.R.\" And the months went by ....\r\n\r\nThen suddenly came a piece of news that made a great stir. It was in\r\nthe latter half of March, 1909. The telegraphic instruments were busy\r\nall over the world; letter by letter, word by word, they ticked out the\r\nmessage, until it could be clearly read that one of the most wonderful\r\nachievements of Polar exploration had been accomplished. Everyone was\r\nspellbound. Was it possible? Could it be true? Shackleton, Lieutenant\r\nR.N.R., had fought his way to lat. 88deg. 23' S.\r\n\r\nSeldom has a man enjoyed a greater triumph; seldom has a man deserved\r\nit better.\r\n\r\nAs the details of Sir Ernest Shackleton's expedition will be fresh\r\nin the minds of English readers, it is unnecessary to recapitulate\r\nthem here. A few points may, however, be noted, for comparison with\r\nthe Fram's expedition.\r\n\r\nThe plan was to leave New Zealand at the beginning of 1908 and go\r\ninto winter quarters on the Antarctic continent with the necessary\r\nprovisions and equipment, while the vessel returned to New Zealand\r\nand came back to take off the land party in the following year.\r\n\r\nThe land party that wintered in the South was divided into three. One\r\nparty was to go eastward to King Edward VII. Land and explore it,\r\nthe second was to go westward to the South Magnetic Pole, and the\r\nthird southward toward the Geographical Pole.\r\n\r\nIn the plan submitted to the Royal Geographical Society Shackleton\r\nsays: \"I do not intend to sacrifice the scientific utility of the\r\nexpedition to a mere record-breaking journey, but say frankly, all\r\nthe same, that one of my great efforts will be to reach the Southern\r\nGeographical Pole.\"\r\n\r\nIt was further intended that the Nimrod should explore Wilkes Land.\r\n\r\nAs draught animals Shackleton had both ponies and dogs, but chiefly\r\nponies. The dogs were regarded more as a reserve. Shackleton's\r\nexperience was that the Ice Barrier was best suited for ponies. They\r\nalso took a motor-car, besides the usual equipment of sledges, ski,\r\ntents, etc.\r\n\r\nLeaving Lyttelton on January 1, 1908, the Nimrod reached the ice-pack\r\non the 15th, and arrived in the open Ross Sea in lat. 70deg. 43' S.,\r\nlong. 178deg. 58' E. The Ross Barrier was sighted on January 23. The\r\noriginal intention was to follow this, and try to land the shore party\r\nin Barrier Inlet, which was practically the beginning of King Edward\r\nVII. Land; but it was found that Barrier Inlet had disappeared, owing\r\nto miles of the Barrier having calved away. In its place was a long,\r\nwide bay, which Shackleton named the Bay of Whales. This discovery\r\ndetermined him not to attempt to winter on the Barrier, but on solid\r\nland. At this part of the voyage the course of the Nimrod coincided\r\nvery nearly with that of the Fram on her second outward trip.\r\n\r\nAfter an unsuccessful attempt to reach King Edward VII. Land,\r\nShackleton turned to the west and took up his winter quarters on Ross\r\nIsland in McMurdo Sound.\r\n\r\nThe southern party, composed of Shackleton, Adams, Marshall, and\r\nWild, started on October 29, 1908, with four sledges, four ponies,\r\nand provisions for ninety-one days. On November 26 Scott's farthest\r\nsouth, 82deg. 17' S. was passed. By the time lat. 84deg. was reached all the\r\nponies were dead, and the men had to draw the sledges themselves. They\r\nwere then faced by the long and difficult ascent of Beardmore Glacier,\r\nand it was not until seventeen days later that they came out on the\r\nhigh plateau surrounding the Pole. At last, on January 9, 1909, they\r\nwere compelled to return by shortness of provisions, having planted\r\nQueen Alexandra's flag in lat. 88deg. 23' S., long. 162deg. E.\r\n\r\nEveryone who reads Shackleton's diary must feel a boundless admiration\r\nfor these four heroes. History can scarcely show a clearer proof of\r\nwhat men can accomplish when they exert their full strength of will\r\nand body. These men have raised a monument, not only to themselves\r\nand their achievement, but also to the honour of their native land\r\nand the whole of civilized humanity.\r\n\r\nShackleton's exploit is the most brilliant incident in the history\r\nof Antarctic exploration.\r\n\r\nThe distance covered, out and back, was 1,530 geographical miles. The\r\ntime occupied was 127 days -- 73 days out and 54 days back. The\r\naverage daily march was about 12 miles.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the other party, composed of Professor David, Mawson,\r\nand Mackay, had set off to determine the position of the South\r\nMagnetic Pole. They had neither ponies nor dogs, and had therefore\r\nto depend solely on their own powers. It seems almost incredible,\r\nbut these men succeeded in working their way on foot over sea-ice\r\nand land-ice, cracks and crevasses, hard snow and loose snow, to the\r\nMagnetic Pole, and making observations there. What was better still,\r\nthey all came back safe and sound. The total distance covered was\r\n1,260 geographical miles.\r\n\r\nIt must have been a proud day for the two parties of the expedition\r\nwhen they met again on the deck of the Nimrod, and could tell each\r\nother of their experiences. More than any of their predecessors,\r\nthese men had succeeded in raising the veil that lay over \"Antarctica.\"\r\n\r\nBut a little corner remained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPlan and Preparations\r\n\r\n\"The deity of success is a woman, and she insists on being won,\r\nnot courted. You've got to seize her and bear her off, instead of\r\nstanding under her window with a mandolin.\" -- Rex Beach.\r\n\r\n\"The North Pole is reached.\"\r\n\r\nIn a flash the news spread over the world. The goal of which so\r\nmany had dreamed, for which so many had laboured and suffered and\r\nsacrificed their lives, was attained. It was in September, 1909,\r\nthat the news reached us.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant I saw quite clearly that the original plan of\r\nthe Fram's third voyage -- the exploration of the North Polar basin\r\n-- hung in the balance. If the expedition was to be saved, it was\r\nnecessary to act quickly and without hesitation. Just as rapidly as\r\nthe message had travelled over the cables I decided on my change of\r\nfront -- to turn to the right-about, and face to the South.\r\n\r\nIt was true that I had announced in my plan that the Fram's third\r\nvoyage would be in every way a scientific expedition, and would have\r\nnothing to do with record-breaking; it was also true that many of\r\nthe contributors who had so warmly supported me had done so with the\r\noriginal plan before them; but in view of the altered circumstances,\r\nand the small prospect I now had of obtaining funds for my original\r\nplan, I considered it neither mean nor unfair to my supporters to\r\nstrike a blow that would at once put the whole enterprise on its feet,\r\nretrieve the heavy expenses that the expedition had already incurred,\r\nand save the contributions from being wasted.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore with a clear conscience that I decided to postpone\r\nmy original plan for a year or two, in order to try in the meantime\r\nto raise the funds that were still lacking. The North Pole, the\r\nlast problem but one of popular interest in Polar exploration,\r\nwas solved. If I was now to succeed in arousing interest in my\r\nundertaking, there was nothing left for me but to try to solve the\r\nlast great problem -- the South Pole.\r\n\r\nI know that I have been reproached for not having at once made\r\nthe extended plan public, so that not only my supporters, but the\r\nexplorers who were preparing to visit the same regions might have\r\nknowledge of it. I was well aware that these reproaches would come,\r\nand had therefore carefully weighed this side of the matter. As\r\nregards the former -- the contributors to my expedition -- my mind\r\nwas soon at rest. They were all men of position, and above discussing\r\nthe application of the sums they had dedicated to the enterprise. I\r\nknew that I enjoyed such confidence among these people that they\r\nwould all judge the circumstances aright, and know that when the time\r\ncame their contributions would be used for the purpose for which they\r\nwere given. And I have already received countless proofs that I was\r\nnot mistaken.\r\n\r\nNor did I feel any great scruples with regard to the other Antarctic\r\nexpeditions that were being planned at the time. I knew I should be\r\nable to inform Captain Scott of the extension of my plans before he\r\nleft civilization, and therefore a few months sooner or later could\r\nbe of no great importance. Scott's plan and equipment were so widely\r\ndifferent from my own that I regarded the telegram that I sent him\r\nlater, with the information that we were bound for the Antarctic\r\nregions, rather as a mark of courtesy than as a communication which\r\nmight cause him to alter his programme in the slightest degree. The\r\nBritish expedition was designed entirely for scientific research. The\r\nPole was only a side-issue, whereas in my extended plan it was the\r\nmain object. On this little detour science would have to look after\r\nitself; but of course I knew very well that we could not reach the\r\nPole by the route I had determined to take without enriching in a\r\nconsiderable degree several branches of science.\r\n\r\nOur preparations were entirely different, and I doubt whether Captain\r\nScott, with his great knowledge of Antarctic exploration, would\r\nhave departed in any point from the experience he had gained and\r\naltered his equipment in accordance with that which I found it best\r\nto employ. For I came far short of Scott both in experience and means.\r\n\r\nAs regards Lieutenant Shirase in the Kainan Maru, I understood it to\r\nbe his plan to devote his whole attention to King Edward VII. Land.\r\n\r\nAfter thus thoroughly considering these questions, I came to the\r\nconclusions I have stated, and my plan was irrevocably fixed. If at\r\nthat juncture I had made my intention public, it would only have given\r\noccasion for a lot of newspaper discussion, and possibly have ended\r\nin the project being stifled at its birth. Everything had to be got\r\nready quietly and calmly. My brother, upon whose absolute silence\r\nI could blindly rely, was the only person I let into the secret of\r\nmy change of plan, and he did me many important services during the\r\ntime when we alone shared the knowledge. Then Lieutenant Thorvald\r\nNilsen -- at that time first officer of the Fram, now her commander --\r\nreturned home, and I considered it my duty to inform him immediately\r\nof my resolve. The way in which he received it made me feel safe in\r\nmy choice of him. I saw that in him I had found not only a capable\r\nand trustworthy man, but a good comrade as well; and this was a point\r\nof the highest importance. If the relations between the chief and the\r\nsecond in command are good, much unpleasantness and many unnecessary\r\nworries can be avoided. Besides which, a good understanding in this\r\nquarter gives an example to the whole ship. It was a great relief to\r\nme when Captain Nilsen came home in January, 1910, and was able to\r\nhelp -- which he did with a good will, a capability, and a reliability\r\nthat I have no words to commend.\r\n\r\nThe following was the plan of the Fram's southern voyage: Departure\r\nfrom Norway at latest before the middle of August. Madeira was to be\r\nthe first and only place of call. From there a course was to be made on\r\nthe best route for a sailing-ship -- for the Fram cannot be regarded\r\nas anything else -- southward through the Atlantic, and then to the\r\neast, passing to the south of the Cape of Good Hope and Australia,\r\nand finally pushing through the pack and into Ross Sea about New\r\nYear, 1911.\r\n\r\nAs a base of operations I had chosen the most southerly point we could\r\nreach with the vessel -- the Bay of Whales in the great Antarctic\r\nBarrier. We hoped to arrive here about January 15. After having\r\nlanded the selected shore party -- about ten men -- with materials\r\nfor a house, equipment, and provisions for two years, the Fram was\r\nto go out again and up to Buenos Aires, in order to carry out from\r\nthere an oceanographical voyage across the Atlantic to the coast of\r\nAfrica and back. In October she was to return to the Bay of Whales\r\nand take off the shore party. So much, but no more, could be settled\r\nbeforehand. The further progress of the expedition could only be\r\ndetermined later, when the work in the South was finished.\r\n\r\nMy knowledge of the Ross Barrier was due to descriptions alone;\r\nbut I had so carefully studied all the literature that treats of\r\nthese regions, that, on first encountering this mighty mass of ice,\r\nI felt as if I had known it for many years.\r\n\r\nAfter thorough consideration, I fixed upon the Bay of Whales as a\r\nwinter station, for several reasons. In the first place, because we\r\ncould there go farther south in the ship than at any other point\r\n-- a whole degree farther south than Scott could hope to get in\r\nMcMurdo Sound, where he was to have his station. And this would be\r\nof very great importance in the subsequent sledge journey toward the\r\nPole. Another great advantage was that we came right on to our field\r\nof work, and could see from our hut door the conditions and surface we\r\nshould have to deal with. Besides this, I was justified in supposing\r\nthat the surface southward from this part of the Barrier would be\r\nconsiderably better, and offer fewer difficulties than the piled-up\r\nice along the land. In addition, animal life in the Bay of Whales was,\r\naccording to the descriptions, extraordinarily rich, and offered all\r\nthe fresh meat we required in the form of seals, penguins, etc.\r\n\r\nBesides these purely technical and material advantages which the\r\nBarrier seemed to possess as a winter station, it offered a specially\r\nfavourable site for an investigation of the meteorological conditions,\r\nsince here one would be unobstructed by land on all sides. It would be\r\npossible to study the character of the Barrier by daily observations on\r\nthe very spot better than anywhere else. Such interesting phenomena as\r\nthe movement, feeding, and calving of this immense mass of ice could,\r\nof course, be studied very fully at this spot.\r\n\r\nLast, but not least, there was the enormous advantage that it was\r\ncomparatively easy to reach in the vessel. No expedition had yet been\r\nprevented from coming in here.\r\n\r\nI knew that this plan of wintering on the Barrier itself would be\r\nexposed to severe criticism as recklessness, foolhardiness, and so\r\nforth, for it was generally assumed that the Barrier was afloat here,\r\nas in other places. Indeed, it was thought to be so even by those who\r\nhad themselves seen it. Shackleton's description of the conditions\r\nat the time of his visit did not seem very promising. Mile after\r\nmile had broken away, and he thanked God he had not made his camp\r\nthere. Although I have a very great regard for Shackleton, his work\r\nand his experience, I believe that in this case his conclusion was\r\ntoo hasty -- fortunately, I must add. For if, when Shackleton passed\r\nthe Bay of Whales on January, 24, 1908, and saw the ice of the bay in\r\nprocess of breaking up and drifting out, he had waited a few hours,\r\nor at the most a couple of days, the problem of the South Pole would\r\nprobably have been solved long before December, 1911. With his keen\r\nsight and sound judgment, it would not have taken him long to determine\r\nthat the inner part of the bay does not consist of floating barrier,\r\nbut that the Barrier there rests upon a good, solid foundation,\r\nprobably in the form of small islands, skerries, or shoals, and from\r\nthis point he and his able companions would have disposed of the South\r\nPolar question once for all. But circumstances willed it otherwise,\r\nand the veil was only lifted, not torn away.\r\n\r\nI had devoted special study to this peculiar formation in the Barrier,\r\nand had arrived at the conclusion that the inlet that exists to-day in\r\nthe Ross Barrier under the name of the Bay of Whales is nothing else\r\nthan the self-same bight that was observed by Sir James Clark Ross\r\n-- no doubt with great changes of outline, but still the same. For\r\nseventy years, then, this formation -- with the exception of the\r\npieces that had broken away -- had persisted in the same place. I\r\ntherefore concluded that it could be no accidental formation. What,\r\nonce, in the dawn of time, arrested the mighty stream of ice at this\r\nspot and formed a lasting bay in its edge, which with few exceptions\r\nruns in an almost straight line, was not merely a passing whim of\r\nthe fearful force that came crashing on, but something even stronger\r\nthan that -- something that was firmer than the hard ice -- namely,\r\nthe solid land. Here in this spot, then, the Barrier piled itself up\r\nand formed the bay we now call the Bay of Whales. The observations we\r\nmade during our stay there confirm the correctness of this theory. I\r\ntherefore had no misgivings in placing our station on this part of\r\nthe Barrier.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the shore party was, as soon as the hut was built and\r\nprovisions landed, to carry supplies into the field, and lay down\r\ndepots as far to the south as possible. I hoped to get such a quantity\r\nof provisions brought down to lat. 80deg. S., that we should be able to\r\nregard this latitude as the real starting-place of the actual sledge\r\njourney to the Pole. We shall see later that this hope was more than\r\nfulfilled, and a labour many times greater than this was performed. By\r\nthe time this depot work was accomplished winter would be before us,\r\nand with the knowledge we had of the conditions in the Antarctic\r\nregions, every precaution would have to be taken to meet the coldest\r\nand probably the most stormy weather that any Polar expedition had\r\nhitherto encountered. My object was, when winter had once set in, and\r\neverything in the station was in good working order, to concentrate\r\nall our forces upon the one object -- that of reaching the Pole.\r\n\r\nI intended to try to get people with me who were specially fitted for\r\noutdoor work in the cold. Even more necessary was it to find men who\r\nwere experienced dog-drivers; I saw what a decisive bearing this would\r\nhave on the result. There are advantages and disadvantages in having\r\nexperienced people with one on an expedition like this. The advantages\r\nare obvious. If a variety of experiences are brought together and\r\nused with common sense, of course a great deal can be achieved. The\r\nexperience of one man will often come in opportunely where that\r\nof another falls short. The experiences of several will supplement\r\neach other, and form something like a perfect whole; this is what I\r\nhoped to obtain. But there is no rose without a thorn; if it has its\r\nadvantages, it also has its drawbacks. The drawback to which one is\r\nliable in this case is that someone or other may think he possesses\r\nso much experience that every opinion but his own is worthless. It\r\nis, of course, regrettable when experience takes this turn, but\r\nwith patience and common sense it can be broken of it. In any case,\r\nthe advantages are so great and predominant that I had determined\r\nto have experienced men to the greatest extent possible. It was my\r\nplan to devote the entire winter to working at our outfit, and to\r\nget it as near to perfection as possible. Another thing to which we\r\nshould have to give some time was the killing of a sufficient number\r\nof seals to provide fresh meat both for ourselves and our dogs for\r\nthe whole time. Scurvy, the worst enemy of Polar expeditions, must\r\nbe kept off at all costs, and to achieve this it was my intention\r\nto use fresh meat every day. It proved easy to carry out this rule,\r\nsince everyone, without exception, preferred seal meat to tinned\r\nfoods. And when spring came I hoped that my companions and I would\r\nbe ready, fit and well, with an outfit complete in every way.\r\n\r\nThe plan was to leave the station as early in the spring as\r\npossible. If we had set out to capture this record, we must at any\r\ncost get there first. Everything must be staked upon this. From the\r\nvery moment when I had formed the plan, I had made up my mind that\r\nour course from the Bay of Whales must be set due south, and follow\r\nthe same meridian, if possible, right up to the Pole. The effect\r\nof this would be that we should traverse an entirely new region,\r\nand gain other results besides beating the record.\r\n\r\nI was greatly astonished to hear, on my return from the South, that\r\nsome people had actually believed we had set our course from the Bay\r\nof Whales for Beardmore Glacier -- Shackleton's route -- and followed\r\nit to the south. Let me hasten to assure them that this idea never\r\nfor a single instant crossed my mind when I made the plan. Scott\r\nhad announced that he was going to take Shackleton's route, and that\r\ndecided the matter. During our long stay at Framheim not one of us\r\never hinted at the possibility of such a course. Without discussion\r\nScott's route was declared out of bounds.\r\n\r\nNo; due south was our way, and the country would have to be difficult\r\nindeed to stop our getting on to the plateau. Our plan was to go\r\nsouth, and not to leave the meridian unless we were forced to do so\r\nby insuperable difficulties. I foresaw, of course, that there would\r\nbe some who would attack me and accuse me of \"shabby rivalry,\" etc.,\r\nand they would perhaps have had some shadow of justification if we had\r\nreally thought of taking Captain Scott's route. But it never occurred\r\nto us for a moment. Our starting-point lay 350 geographical miles from\r\nScott's winter quarters in McMurdo Sound, so there could be no question\r\nof encroaching upon his sphere of action. Moreover, Professor Nansen,\r\nin his direct and convincing way, has put an end once for all to this\r\ntwaddle, so that I need not dwell upon it any longer.\r\n\r\nI worked out the plan, as here given, at my home on Bundefjord, near\r\nChristiania, in September, 1909, and as it was laid, so was it carried\r\nout to the last detail. That my estimate of the time it would take\r\nwas not so very far out is proved by the final sentence of the plan:\r\n\"Thus we shall be back from the Polar journey on January 25.\" It was\r\non January 25, 1912, that we came into Framheim after our successful\r\njourney to the Pole.\r\n\r\nThis was not the only time our calculations proved correct; Captain\r\nNilsen showed himself to be a veritable magician in this way. While I\r\ncontented myself with reckoning dates, he did not hesitate to go into\r\nhours. He calculated that we should reach the Barrier on January 15,\r\n1911; this is a distance of 16,000 geographical miles from Norway. We\r\nwere at the Barrier on January 14, one day before the time. There\r\nwas not much wrong with that estimate.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Storthing's resolution of February 9, 1909,\r\nthe Fram was lent for the use of the expedition, and a sum of 75,000\r\nkroner (4,132 pounds sterling) was voted for repairs and necessary\r\nalterations.\r\n\r\nThe provisions were chosen with the greatest care, and packed with\r\nevery precaution. All groceries were soldered in tin boxes, and then\r\nenclosed in strong wooden cases. The packing of tinned provisions\r\nis of enormous importance to a Polar expedition; it is impossible to\r\ngive too much attention to this part of the supplies. Any carelessness,\r\nany perfunctory packing on the part of the factory, will as a rule lead\r\nto scurvy. It is an interesting fact that on the four Norwegian Polar\r\nexpeditions -- the three voyages of the Fram and the Gjoa's voyage --\r\nnot a single case of scurvy occurred. This is good evidence of the\r\ncare with which these expeditions were provisioned.\r\n\r\nIn this matter we owe a deep debt of gratitude above all to Professor\r\nSophus Torup, who has always been the supervising authority in the\r\nmatter of provisioning, this time as well as on the former occasions.\r\n\r\nGreat praise is also due to the factories that supplied our tinned\r\ngoods. By their excellent and conscientious work they deserved well\r\nof the expedition. In this case a part of the supplies was entrusted\r\nto a Stavanger factory, which, in addition to the goods supplied to\r\norder, with great generosity placed at the disposal of the expedition\r\nprovisions to the value of 2,000 kroner (L110). The other half of the\r\ntinned foods required was ordered from a firm at Moss. The manager\r\nof this firm undertook at the same time to prepare the necessary\r\npemmican for men and dogs, and executed this commission in a way that\r\nI cannot sufficiently praise. Thanks to this excellent preparation,\r\nthe health both of men and dogs on the journey to the Pole was always\r\nremarkably good. The pemmican we took was essentially different from\r\nthat which former expeditions had used. Previously the pemmican had\r\ncontained nothing but the desired mixture of dried meat and lard;\r\nours had, besides these, vegetables and oatmeal, an addition which\r\ngreatly improves its flavour, and, as far as we could judge, makes\r\nit easier to digest.\r\n\r\nThis kind of pemmican was first produced for the use of the Norwegian\r\nArmy; it was intended to take the place of the \"emergency ration.\" The\r\nexperiment was not concluded at the time the expedition left, but\r\nit may be hoped that the result has proved satisfactory. A more\r\nstimulating, nourishing, and appetizing food, it would be impossible\r\nto find.\r\n\r\nBut besides the pemmican for ourselves, that for our dogs was equally\r\nimportant, for they are just as liable to be attacked by scurvy as\r\nwe men. The same care had therefore to be devoted to the preparation\r\nof their food. We obtained from Moss two kinds of pemmican, one made\r\nwith fish and the other with meat. Both kinds contained, besides the\r\ndried fish (or meat) and lard, a certain proportion of dried milk\r\nand middlings. Both kinds were equally excellent, and the dogs were\r\nalways in splendid condition. The pemmican was divided into rations of\r\n1 pound 1.5 ounces, and could be served out to the dogs as it was. But\r\nbefore we should be able to use this pemmican we had a five months'\r\nvoyage before us, and for this part of the expedition I had to look\r\nfor a reliable supply of dried fish. This I found through the agent of\r\nthe expedition at Tromso, Mr. Fritz Zappfe. Two well-known firms also\r\nplaced large quantities of the best dried fish at my disposal. With\r\nall this excellent fish and some barrels of lard we succeeded in\r\nbringing our dogs through in the best of condition.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important of our preparations was to find good\r\ndogs. As I have said, I had to act with decision and promptitude if\r\nI was to succeed in getting everything in order. The day after my\r\ndecision was made, therefore, I was on my way to Copenhagen, where\r\nthe Inspectors for Greenland, Messrs. Daugaard-Jensen and Bentzen,\r\nwere to be found at that moment. The director of the Royal Greenland\r\nTrading Company, Mr. Rydberg, showed, as before, the most friendly\r\ninterest in my undertaking, and gave the inspectors a free hand. I then\r\nnegotiated with these gentlemen, and they undertook to provide 100\r\nof the finest Greenland dogs and to deliver them in Norway in July,\r\n1910. The dog question was thus as good as solved, since the choice\r\nwas placed in the most expert hands. I was personally acquainted\r\nwith Inspector Daugaard-Jensen from former dealings with him, and\r\nknew that whatever he undertook would be performed with the greatest\r\nconscientiousness. The administration of the Royal Greenland Trading\r\nCompany gave permission for the dogs to be conveyed free of charge\r\non board the Hans Egede and delivered at Christiansand.\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed to our further equipment, I must say a few more\r\nwords about the dogs. The greatest difference between Scott's and\r\nmy equipment lay undoubtedly in our choice of draught animals. We\r\nhad heard that Scott, relying on his own experience, and that of\r\nShackleton, had come to the conclusion that Manchurian ponies were\r\nsuperior to dogs on the Barrier. Among those who were acquainted with\r\nthe Eskimo dog, I do not suppose I was the only one who was startled\r\non first hearing this. Afterwards, as I read the different narratives\r\nand was able to form an accurate opinion of the conditions of surface\r\nand going, my astonishment became even greater. Although I had never\r\nseen this part of the Antarctic regions, I was not long in forming\r\nan opinion diametrically opposed to that of Shackleton and Scott, for\r\nthe conditions both of going and surface were precisely what one would\r\ndesire for sledging with Eskimo dogs, to judge from the descriptions\r\nof these explorers. If Peary could make a record trip on the Arctic\r\nice with dogs, one ought, surely, with equally good tackle, to be\r\nable to beat Peary's record on the splendidly even surface of the\r\nBarrier. There must be some misunderstanding or other at the bottom\r\nof the Englishmen's estimate of the Eskimo dog's utility in the Polar\r\nregions. Can it be that the dog has not understood his master? Or\r\nis it the master who has not understood his dog? The right footing\r\nmust be established from the outset; the dog must understand that\r\nhe has to obey in everything, and the master must know how to make\r\nhimself respected. If obedience is once established, I am convinced\r\nthat the dog will be superior to all other draught animals over these\r\nlong distances.\r\n\r\nAnother very important reason for using the dog is that this small\r\ncreature can much more easily cross the numerous slight snow-bridges\r\nthat are not to be avoided on the Barrier and on the glaciers. If a\r\ndog falls into a crevasse there is no great harm done; a tug at his\r\nharness and he is out again; but it is another matter with a pony. This\r\ncomparatively large and heavy animal of course falls through far more\r\neasily, and if this happens, it is a long and stiff job to get the\r\nbeast hauled up again -- unless, indeed, the traces have broken and\r\nthe pony lies at the bottom of a crevasse 1,000 feet deep.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is the obvious advantage that dog can be fed on\r\ndog. One can reduce one's pack little by little, slaughtering the\r\nfeebler ones and feeding the chosen with them. In this way they get\r\nfresh meat. Our dogs lived on dog's flesh and pemmican the whole way,\r\nand this enabled them to do splendid work.\r\n\r\nAnd if we ourselves wanted a piece of fresh meat we could cut off a\r\ndelicate little fillet; it tasted to us as good as the best beef. The\r\ndogs do not object at all; as long as they get their share they do not\r\nmind what part of their comrade's carcass it comes from. All that was\r\nleft after one of these canine meals was the teeth of the victim --\r\nand if it had been a really hard day, these also disappeared.\r\n\r\nIf we take a step farther, from the Barrier to the plateau, it would\r\nseem that every doubt of the dog's superiority must disappear. Not\r\nonly can one get the dogs up over the huge glaciers that lead to the\r\nplateau, but one can make full use of them the whole way. Ponies, on\r\nthe other hand, have to be left at the foot of the glacier, while the\r\nmen themselves have the doubtful pleasure of acting as ponies. As I\r\nunderstand Shackleton's account, there can be no question of hauling\r\nthe ponies over the steep and crevassed glaciers. It must be rather\r\nhard to have to abandon one's motive power voluntarily when only a\r\nquarter of the distance has been covered. I for my part prefer to\r\nuse it all the way.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning I saw that the first part of our expedition,\r\nfrom Norway to the Barrier, would be the most dangerous section. If we\r\ncould only reach the Barrier with our dogs safe and well, the future\r\nwould be bright enough. Fortunately all my comrades took the same view\r\nof the matter, and with their cooperation we succeeded not only in\r\nbringing the dogs safely to our field of operations, but in landing\r\nthem in far better condition than when we received them. Their number\r\nwas also considerably increased on the way, which seems to be another\r\nproof of a flourishing state of things. To protect them against damp\r\nand heat we laid a loose deck of planed boards about 3 inches above\r\nthe fixed deck, an arrangement by which all the rain and spray ran\r\nunderneath the dogs. In this way we kept them out of the water, which\r\nmust always be running from side to side on the deck of a deep-laden\r\nvessel on her way to the Antarctic Ocean. Going through the tropics\r\nthis loose deck did double service. It always afforded a somewhat cool\r\nsurface, as there was a fresh current of air between the two decks. The\r\nmain deck, which was black with tar, would have been unbearably hot\r\nfor the animals; the false deck was high, and kept fairly white during\r\nthe whole voyage. We carried awnings in addition, chiefly on account\r\nof the dogs. These awnings could be stretched over the whole vessel\r\nand give the dogs constant protection from the burning sun.\r\n\r\nI still cannot help smiling when I think of the compassionate voices\r\nthat were raised here and there -- and even made their way into\r\nprint -- about the \"cruelty to animals\" on board the Fram. Presumably\r\nthese cries came from tender-hearted individuals who themselves kept\r\nwatch-dogs tied up.\r\n\r\nBesides our four-footed companions, we took with us a two-footed one,\r\nnot so much on account of the serious work in the Polar regions as for\r\npleasant entertainment on the way. This was our canary \"Fridtjof.\" It\r\nwas one of the many presents made to the expedition, and not the\r\nleast welcome of them. It began to sing as soon as it came on board,\r\nand has now kept it going on two circumnavigations through the most\r\ninhospitable waters of the earth. It probably holds the record as a\r\nPolar traveller among its kind.\r\n\r\nLater on we had a considerable collection of various families: pigs,\r\nfowls, sheep, cats, and -- rats. Yes, unfortunately, we knew what it\r\nwas to have rats on board, the most repulsive of all creatures, and\r\nthe worst vermin I know of. But we have declared war against them,\r\nand off they shall go before the Fram starts on her next voyage. We\r\ngot them in Buenos Aires, and the best thing will be to bury them in\r\ntheir native land.\r\n\r\nOn account of the rather straitened circumstances the expedition had\r\nto contend with, I had to look twice at every shilling before I spent\r\nit. Articles of clothing are an important factor in a Polar expedition,\r\nand I consider it necessary that the expedition should provide each\r\nof its members with the actual \"Polar clothing.\" If one left this\r\npart of the equipment to each individual, I am afraid things would\r\nlook badly before the journey was done. I must admit that there was\r\nsome temptation to do this. It would have been very much cheaper if\r\nI had simply given each man a list of what clothes he was required\r\nto provide for himself. But by so doing I should have missed the\r\nopportunity of personally supervising the quality of the clothing to\r\nthe extent I desired.\r\n\r\nIt was not an outfit that cut a dash by its appearance, but it was warm\r\nand strong. From the commissariat stores at Horten I obtained many\r\nexcellent articles. I owe Captain Pedersen, the present chief of the\r\nCommissariat Department, my heartiest thanks for the courtesy he always\r\nshowed me when I came to get things out of him. Through him I had about\r\n200 blankets served out to me. Now, the reader must not imagine a bed\r\nand bedding, such as he may see exhibited in the windows of furniture\r\nshops, with thick, white blankets, so delicate that in spite of their\r\nthickness they look as if they might float away of their own accord,\r\nso light and fine do they appear. It was not blankets like these\r\nthat Captain Pedersen gave us; we should not have known what to do\r\nwith them if he had. The blankets the commissariat gave us were of an\r\nentirely different sort. As to their colour -- well, I can only call\r\nit indeterminable -- and they did not give one the impression that\r\nthey would float away either, if one let go of them. No, they would\r\nkeep on the ground right enough; they were felted and pressed together\r\ninto a thick, hard mass. From the dawn of time they had served our\r\nbrave warriors at sea, and it is by no means impossible that some of\r\nthem had gruesome stories to tell of the days of Tordenskjold. The\r\nfirst thing I did, on obtaining possession of these treasures, was\r\nto get them into the dyeing-vat. They were unrecognizable when I\r\ngot them back -- in ultramarine blue, or whatever it was called. The\r\nmetamorphosis was complete: their warlike past was wiped out.\r\n\r\nMy intention was to have these two hundred blankets made into Polar\r\nclothing, and I took counsel with myself how I might get this done. To\r\ndisclose the origin of the stuff would be an unfortunate policy. No\r\ntailor in the world would make clothes out of old blankets, I was\r\npretty sure of that. I had to hit upon some stratagem. I heard of\r\na man who was a capable worker at his trade, and asked him to come\r\nand see me. My office looked exactly like a woollen warehouse, with\r\nblankets everywhere. The tailor arrived. \"Was that the stuff?\" \"Yes,\r\nthat was it. Just imported from abroad. A great bargain. A lot of\r\nsamples dirt cheap.\" I had put on my most innocent and unconcerned\r\nexpression. I saw the tailor glance at me sideways; I suppose he\r\nthought the samples were rather large. \"A closely woven stuff,\"\r\nsaid he, holding it up to the light. \"I could almost swear it was\r\n'felted.' \" We went carefully through every single sample, and took\r\nthe number. It was a long and tedious business, and I was glad when\r\nI saw that at last we were nearing the end. Over in a corner there\r\nlay a few more; we had reached the one hundred and ninety-third, so\r\nthere could not be many in the pile. I was occupied with something\r\nelse, and the tailor went through the remainder by himself. I was\r\njust congratulating myself on the apparently fortunate result of the\r\nmorning's work when I was startled by an exclamation from the man\r\nin the corner. It sounded like the bellow of a mad bull. Alas! there\r\nstood the tailor enveloped in ultramarine, and swinging over his head\r\na blanket, the couleur changeante of which left no doubt as to the\r\norigin of the \"directly imported\" goods. With a look of thunder the man\r\nquitted me, and I sank in black despair. I never saw him again. The\r\nfact was that in my hurry I had forgotten the sample blanket that\r\nCaptain Pedersen had sent me. That was the cause of the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nWell, I finally succeeded in getting the work executed, and it is\r\ncertain that no expedition has ever had warmer and stronger clothing\r\nthan this. It was in great favour on board.\r\n\r\nI also thought it best to provide good oilskins, and especially\r\ngood sea-boots for every man. The sea-boots were therefore made to\r\nmeasure, and of the very best material. I had them made by the firm\r\nI have always regarded as the best in that branch. How, then, shall\r\nI describe our grief when, on the day we were to wear our beautiful\r\nsea-boots, we discovered that most of them were useless? Some of the\r\nmen could dance a hornpipe in theirs without taking the boots off\r\nthe deck. Others, by exerting all their strength, could not squeeze\r\ntheir foot through the narrow way and reach paradise. The leg was so\r\nnarrow that even the most delicate little foot could not get through\r\nit, and to make up for this the foot of the boot was so huge that\r\nit could comfortably accommodate twice as much as its owner could\r\nshow. Very few were able to wear their boots. We tried changing,\r\nbut that was no use; the boots were not made for any creatures of\r\nthis planet. But sailors are sailors wherever they may be; it is not\r\neasy to beat them. Most of them knew the proverb that one pair of\r\nboots that fit is better than ten pairs that you can't put on, and\r\nhad brought their own with them. And so we got out of that difficulty.\r\n\r\nWe took three sets of linen underclothing for every man, to wear\r\nin the warm regions. This part of the equipment was left to each\r\nindividual; most men possess a few old shirts, and not much more is\r\nwanted through the tropics. For the cold regions there were two sets\r\nof extra thick woollen underclothing, two thick hand-knitted woollen\r\njerseys, six pairs of knitted stockings, Iceland and other lighter\r\njackets, socks and stockings from the penitentiary.\r\n\r\nBesides these we had a quantity of clothing from the army depots. I\r\nowe many thanks to General Keilhau for the kind way in which he fell\r\nin with all my wishes. From this quarter we obtained outer clothing for\r\nboth cold and warm climates, underclothes, boots, shoes, wind-clothing,\r\nand cloths of different kinds.\r\n\r\nAs the last item of our personal equipment I may mention that each\r\nman had a suit of sealskin from Greenland. Then there were such things\r\nas darning-wool, sewing-yarn, needles of all possible sizes, buttons,\r\nscissors, tapes -- broad and narrow, black and white, blue and red. I\r\nmay safely assert that nothing was forgotten; we were well and amply\r\nequipped in every way.\r\n\r\nAnother side of our preparations which claimed some attention was\r\nthe fitting up of the quarters we were to inhabit, the saloons and\r\ncabins. What an immense difference it makes if one lives in comfortable\r\nsurroundings. For my part, I can do twice the amount of work when I\r\nsee tidiness and comfort around me. The saloons on the Fram were very\r\nhandsomely and tastefully fitted. Here we owe, in the first place, our\r\nrespectful thanks to King Haakon and Queen Maud for the photographs\r\nthey presented to us; they were the most precious of our gifts. The\r\nladies of Horten gave us a number of pretty things for decorating the\r\ncabins, and they will no doubt be glad to hear of the admiration they\r\naroused wherever we went. \"Is this really a Polar ship?\" people asked;\r\n\"we expected to see nothing but wooden benches and bare walls.\" And\r\nthey began to talk about \"boudoirs\" and things of that sort. Besides\r\nsplendid embroideries, our walls were decorated with the most wonderful\r\nphotographs; it would have rejoiced the giver of these to hear all\r\nthe words of praise that have been bestowed upon them.\r\n\r\nThe sleeping quarters I left to individual taste: every man could\r\ntake a bit of his home in his own little compartment. The bedclothes\r\ncame from the naval factory at Horten; they were first-class work,\r\nlike everything else that came from there. We owe our best thanks to\r\nthe giver of the soft blankets that have so often been our joy and\r\nput warmth into us after a bitter day; they came from a woollen mill\r\nat Trondhjem.\r\n\r\nI must also mention our paper-supply, which was in all respects as fine\r\nand elegant as it could possibly be: the most exquisite notepaper,\r\nstamped with a picture of the Fram and the name of the expedition,\r\nin large and small size, broad and narrow, old style and new style --\r\nevery kind of notepaper, in fact. Of pens and penholders, pencils,\r\nblack and coloured, india-rubber, Indian ink, drawing-pins and\r\nother kinds of pins, ink and ink-powder, white chalk and red chalk,\r\ngum arabic and other gums, date-holders and almanacs, ship's logs\r\nand private diaries, notebooks and sledging diaries, and many other\r\nthings of the same sort, we have such a stock that we shall be able to\r\ncircumnavigate the earth several times more before running short. This\r\ngift does honour to the firm which sent it; every time I have sent\r\na letter or written in my diary, I have had a grateful thought for\r\nthe givers.\r\n\r\nFrom one of the largest houses in Christiania we had a complete set\r\nof kitchen utensils and breakfast and dinner services, all of the\r\nbest kind. The cups, plates, knives, forks, spoons, jugs, glasses,\r\netc., were all marked with the ship's name.\r\n\r\nWe carried an extraordinarily copious library; presents of books were\r\nshowered upon us in great quantities. I suppose the Fram's library\r\nat the present moment contains at least 3,000 volumes.\r\n\r\nFor our entertainment we also had a good many different games. One\r\nof these became our favourite pastime in leisure evenings down in\r\nthe South. Packs of cards we had by the dozen, and many of them have\r\nalready been well used. A gramophone with a large supply of records\r\nwas, I think, our best friend. Of musical instruments we had a piano,\r\na violin, a flute, mandolins, not forgetting a mouth-organ and an\r\naccordion. All the publishers had been kind enough to send us music,\r\nso that we could cultivate this art as much as we wished.\r\n\r\nChristmas presents streamed in from all sides; I suppose we had about\r\nfive hundred on board. Christmas-trees and decorations for them,\r\nwith many other things to amuse us at Christmas, were sent with us\r\nby friends and acquaintances. People have indeed been kind to us,\r\nand I can assure the givers that all their presents have been, and\r\nare still, much appreciated.\r\n\r\nWe were well supplied with wines and spirits, thanks to one of the\r\nlargest firms of wine-merchants in Christiania. An occasional glass of\r\nwine or a tot of spirits were things that we all, without exception,\r\nwere very glad of. The question of alcohol on Polar expeditions has\r\noften been discussed. Personally, I regard alcohol, used in moderation,\r\nas a medicine in the Polar regions -- I mean, of course, so long as\r\none is in winter quarters. It is another matter on sledge journeys:\r\nthere we all know from experience that alcohol must be banished --\r\nnot because a drink of spirits can do any harm, but on account of\r\nthe weight and space. On sledging journeys one has, of course, to\r\nsave weight as much as possible, and to take only what is strictly\r\nnecessary; and I do not include alcohol under the head of strictly\r\nnecessary things. Nor was it only in winter quarters that we had use\r\nfor alcohol, but also on the long, monotonous voyage through raw, cold,\r\nand stormy regions. A tot of spirits is often a very good thing when\r\none goes below after a bitter watch on deck and is just turning in. A\r\ntotal abstainer will no doubt turn up his nose and ask whether a cup\r\nof good warm coffee would not do as well. For my part, I think the\r\nquantity of coffee people pour into themselves at such times is far\r\nmore harmful than a little Lysholmer snaps. And think of the important\r\npart a glass of wine or toddy plays in social gatherings on such a\r\nvoyage. Two men who have fallen out a little in the course of the week\r\nare reconciled at once by the scent of rum; the past is forgotten,\r\nand they start afresh in friendly co-operation. Take alcohol away from\r\nthese little festivities, and you will soon see the difference. It is\r\na sad thing, someone will say, that men absolutely must have alcohol to\r\nput them in a good humour -- and I am quite ready to agree. But seeing\r\nthat our nature is what it is, we must try to make the best of it. It\r\nseems as though we civilized human beings must have stimulating drinks,\r\nand that being so, we have to follow our own convictions. I am for a\r\nglass of toddy. Let who will eat plum-cake and swill hot coffee --\r\nheartburn and other troubles are often the result of this kind of\r\nrefreshment. A little toddy doesn't hurt anybody.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of alcohol on the Fram's third voyage was as follows:\r\nOne dram and fifteen drops at dinner on Wednesdays and Sundays,\r\nand a glass of toddy on Saturday evenings. On holidays there was an\r\nadditional allowance.\r\n\r\nWe were all well supplied with tobacco and cigars from various firms\r\nat home and abroad. We had enough cigars to allow us one each on\r\nSaturday evenings and after dinner on Sundays.\r\n\r\nTwo Christiania manufacturers sent us their finest bonbons and drops,\r\nand a foreign firm gave us \"Gala Peter,\" so that it was no rare thing\r\nto see the Polar explorers helping themselves to a sweetmeat or a\r\npiece of chocolate. An establishment at Drammen gave us as much fruit\r\nsyrup as we could drink, and if the giver only knew how many times\r\nwe blessed the excellent product he supplied, I am sure he would be\r\npleased. On the homeward march from the Pole we looked forward every\r\nday to getting nearer to our supply of syrup.\r\n\r\nFrom three different firms in Christiania we received all our\r\nrequirements in the way of cheese, biscuits, tea, sugar, and\r\ncoffee. The packing of the last-named was so efficient that, although\r\nthe coffee was roasted, it is still as fresh and aromatic as the day\r\nit left the warehouse. Another firm sent us soap enough for five\r\nyears, and one uses a good deal of that commodity even on a Polar\r\nvoyage. A man in Christiania had seen to the care of our skin, hair,\r\nand teeth, and it is not his fault if we have not delicate skins,\r\nabundant growth of hair, and teeth like pearls, for the outfit was\r\ncertainly complete enough.\r\n\r\nAn important item of the equipment is the medical department, and\r\nhere my advisers were Dr. Jacob Roll and Dr. Holth; therefore nothing\r\nwas wanting. A chemist in Christiania supplied all the necessary\r\nmedicines as a contribution, carefully chosen, and beautifully\r\narranged. Unfortunately no doctor accompanied the expedition, so that\r\nI was obliged to take all the responsibility myself.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Gjertsen, who had a pronounced aptitude both for drawing\r\nteeth and amputating legs, went through a \"lightning course\" at the\r\nhospital and the dental hospital. He clearly showed that much may be\r\nlearnt in a short time by giving one's mind to it. With surprising\r\nrapidity and apparent confidence Lieutenant Gjertsen disposed of the\r\nmost complicated cases -- whether invariably to the patient's advantage\r\nis another question, which I shall leave undecided. He drew teeth\r\nwith a dexterity that strongly reminded one of the conjurer's art;\r\none moment he showed an empty pair of forceps, the next there was a\r\nbig molar in their grip. The yells one heard while the operation was\r\nin progress seemed to indicate that it was not entirely painless.\r\n\r\nA match factory gave us all the safety matches we wanted. They were\r\npacked so securely that we could quite well have towed the cases\r\nafter us in the sea all the way, and found the matches perfectly dry\r\non arrival. We had a quantity of ammunition and explosives. As the\r\nwhole of the lower hold was full of petroleum, the Fram had a rather\r\ndangerous cargo on board. We therefore took all possible precautions\r\nagainst fire; extinguishing apparatus was fitted in every cabin and\r\nwherever practicable, and pumps with hose were always in readiness\r\non deck.\r\n\r\nThe necessary ice-tools, such as saws from 2 to 6 metres long,\r\nice-drills, etc., were not forgotten.\r\n\r\nWe had a number of scientific instruments with us. Professors Nansen\r\nand Helland-Hansen had devoted many an hour to our oceanographical\r\nequipment, which was therefore a model of what such an equipment\r\nshould be. Lieutenants Prestrud and Gjertsen had both gone through the\r\nnecessary course in oceanography under Helland-Hansen at the Bergen\r\nbiological station. I myself had spent a summer there, and taken part\r\nin one of the oceanographical courses. Professor Helland-Hansen was a\r\nbrilliant teacher; I am afraid I cannot assert that I was an equally\r\nbrilliant pupil.\r\n\r\nProfessor Mohn had given us a complete meteorological outfit. Among the\r\ninstruments belonging to the Fram I may mention a pendulum apparatus,\r\nan excellent astronomical theodolite, and a sextant. Lieutenant\r\nPrestrud studied the use of the pendulum apparatus under Professor\r\nSchiotz and the use of the astronomical theodolite under Professor\r\nGeelmuyden. We had in addition several sextants and artificial\r\nhorizons, both glass and mercury. We had binoculars of all sizes,\r\nfrom the largest to the smallest.\r\n\r\nSo far I have been dealing with our general outfit, and shall now pass\r\nto the special equipment of the shore party. The hut we took out was\r\nbuilt on my property on Bundefjord, so that I was able to watch the\r\nwork as it progressed. It was built by the brothers Hans and Jorgen\r\nStubberud, and was throughout a splendid piece of work, which did\r\nhonour to both the brothers. The materials proved excellent in every\r\nway. The hut was 26 feet long by 13 feet wide; its height from the\r\nfloor to the ridge of the roof was about 12 feet. It was built as an\r\nordinary Norwegian house, with pointed gable, and had two rooms. One\r\nof these was 19 1/2 feet long, and was to serve as our dormitory,\r\ndining-room, and sitting-room; the other room was 6 1/2 feet long,\r\nand was to be Lindstrom's kitchen. From the kitchen a double trap-door\r\nled to the loft, where we intended to keep a quantity of provisions and\r\noutfit. The walls consisted of 3-inch planks, with air space between;\r\npanels outside and inside, with air space between them and the plank\r\nwalling. For insulation we used cellulose pulp. The floor and the\r\nceiling between the rooms and the loft were double, while the upper\r\nroof was single. The doors were extraordinarily thick and strong, and\r\nfitted into oblique grooves, so that they closed very tightly. There\r\nwere two windows -- a triple one in the end wall of the main room,\r\nand a double one in the kitchen. For the covering of the roof we\r\ntook out roofing-paper, and for the floor linoleum. In the main room\r\nthere were two air-pipes, one to admit fresh air, the other for the\r\nexhaust. There were bunks for ten men in two stages, six on one wall\r\nand four on the other. The furniture of the room consisted of a table,\r\na stool for each man, and a Lux lamp.\r\n\r\nOne half of the kitchen was occupied by the range, the other by shelves\r\nand cooking utensils. The hut was tarred several times, and every part\r\nwas carefully marked, so that it could easily be set up. To fasten it\r\nto the ground and prevent the Antarctic storms from blowing it away I\r\nhad strong eyebolts screwed into each end of the roof-ridge and the\r\nfour corners of the roof; we carried six strong eyebolts, a metre\r\nlong, to be rammed into the barrier; between these bolts and those\r\non the hut, steel wires were to be stretched, which could be drawn\r\nquite tight. We also had two spare cables, which could be stretched\r\nover the roof if the gales were too severe. The two ventilating pipes\r\nand the chimney were secured outside with strong stays.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen, every precaution was taken to make the hut warm and\r\ncomfortable, and to hold it down on the ground. We also took on board\r\na quantity of loose timber, boards and planks.\r\n\r\nBesides the hut we took with us fifteen tents for sixteen men each. Ten\r\nof these were old, but good; they were served out to us from the naval\r\nstores; the other five were new, and we bought them from the army\r\ndepots. It was our intention to use the tents as temporary houses;\r\nthey were easily and quickly set up, and were strong and warm. On the\r\nvoyage to the South Ronne sewed new floors of good, strong canvas to\r\nthe five new tents.\r\n\r\nAll cases of provisions that were intended for winter quarters were\r\nmarked and stowed separately in the hold in such a way that they\r\ncould be put out on to the ice at once.\r\n\r\nWe had ten sledges made by a firm of sporting outfitters in\r\nChristiania. They were built like the old Nansen sledges, but rather\r\nbroader, and were 12 feet long. The runners were of the best American\r\nhickory, shod with steel. The other parts were of good, tough Norwegian\r\nash. To each sledge belonged a pair of spare runners, which could\r\neasily be fitted underneath by means of clamps, and as easily removed\r\nwhen not required. The steel shoeing of the runners was well coated\r\nwith red lead, and the spare runners with tar. These sledges were\r\nextremely strongly built, and could stand all kinds of work on every\r\nsort of surface. At that time I did not know the conditions on the\r\nBarrier as I afterwards came to know them. Of course, these sledges\r\nwere very heavy.\r\n\r\nWe took twenty pairs of ski, all of the finest hickory; they were\r\n8 feet long, and proportionately narrow. I chose them of this length\r\nwith a view to being able to cross the numerous cracks in the glaciers;\r\nthe greater the surface over which the weight could be distributed, the\r\nbetter prospect we should have of slipping over the snow-bridges. We\r\nhad forty ski-poles, with ebonite points. The ski-bindings were a\r\ncombination of the Huitfeldt and the Hoyer Ellefsen bindings. We also\r\nhad quantities of loose straps.\r\n\r\nWe had six three-man tents, all made in the navy workshops. The\r\nworkmanship could not have been better; they were the strongest and\r\nmost practical tents that have ever been used. They were made of the\r\nclosest canvas, with the floor in one piece. One man was sufficient to\r\nset up the tent in the stiffest breeze; I have come to the conclusion\r\nthat the fewer poles a tent has, the easier it is to set up, which\r\nseems quite natural. These tents have only one pole. How often one\r\nreads in narratives of Polar travel that it took such and such a time\r\n-- often hours -- to set up the tent, and then, when at last it was\r\nup, one lay expecting it to be blown down at any moment. There was\r\nno question of this with our tents. They were up in a twinkling,\r\nand stood against all kinds of wind; we could lie securely in our\r\nsleeping-bags, and let it blow.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the door was on the usual sack principle, which is\r\nnow recognized as the only serviceable one for the Polar regions. The\r\nsack patent is quite simple, like all patents that are any good. You\r\ncut an opening in the tent of the size you wish; then you take a sack,\r\nwhich you leave open at both ends, and sew one end fast round the\r\nopening of the tent. The funnel formed by the open sack is then the\r\nentrance. When you have come in, you gather up the open end of the\r\nfunnel or sack, and tie it together. Not a particle of snow can get\r\ninto a tent with the floor sewed on and an entrance of this kind,\r\neven in the worst storm.\r\n\r\nThe cases for sledging provisions were made of fairly thin, tough ash,\r\nwhich came from the estate of Palsgaard in Jutland, and the material\r\ndid all it promised. These cases were 1 foot square and 15 1/2 inches\r\nhigh. They had only a little round opening on the top, closed with an\r\naluminium lid, which fitted exactly like the lid of a milk-can. Large\r\nlids weaken the cases, and I had therefore chosen this form. We did\r\nnot have to throw off the lashing of the case to get the lid off,\r\nand this is a very great advantage; we could always get at it. A case\r\nwith a large lid, covered by the lashing, gives constant trouble;\r\nthe whole lashing has to be undone for every little thing one wants\r\nout of the case. This is not always convenient; if one is tired and\r\nslack, it may sometimes happen that one will put off till to-morrow\r\nwhat ought to be done to-day, especially when it is bitterly cold. The\r\nhandier one's sledging outfit, the sooner one gets into the tent and\r\nto rest, and that is no small consideration on a long journey.\r\n\r\nOur outfit of clothing was abundant and more complete, I suppose, than\r\nthat of any former Polar expedition. We may divide it into two classes,\r\nthe outfit for specially low temperatures and that for more moderate\r\ntemperatures. It must be remembered that no one had yet wintered on\r\nthe Barrier, so we had to be prepared for anything. In order to be\r\nable to grapple with any degree of cold, we were supplied with the\r\nrichest assortment of reindeer-skin clothing; we had it specially\r\nthick, medium, and quite light. It took a long time to get these\r\nskin clothes prepared. First the reindeer-skins had to be bought\r\nin a raw state, and this was done for me by Mr. Zappfe at Tromso,\r\nKarasjok, and Kaatokeino. Let me take the opportunity of thanking\r\nthis man for the many and great services he has rendered me, not\r\nonly during my preparations for the third voyage of the Fram, but\r\nin the fitting out of the Gjoa expedition as well. With his help\r\nI have succeeded in obtaining things that I should otherwise never\r\nhave been able to get. He shrank from no amount of work, but went\r\non till he had found what I wanted. This time he procured nearly\r\ntwo hundred and fifty good reindeer-skins, dressed by the Lapps,\r\nand sent them to Christiania. Here I had great trouble in finding\r\na man who could sew skins, but at last I found one. We then went\r\nto work to make clothes after the pattern of the Netchelli Eskimo,\r\nand the sewing went on early and late -- thick anoraks and thin ones,\r\nheavy breeches and light, winter stockings and summer stockings. We\r\nalso had a dozen thin sleeping-bags, which I thought of using inside\r\nthe big thick ones if the cold should be too severe. Everything was\r\nfinished, but not until the last moment. The outer sleeping-bags were\r\nmade by Mr. Brandt, furrier, of Bergen, and they were so excellent,\r\nboth in material and making-up, that no one in the world could\r\nhave done better; it was a model piece of work. To save this outer\r\nsleeping-bag, we had it provided with a cover of the lightest canvas,\r\nwhich was a good deal longer than the bag itself. It was easy to tie\r\nthe end of the cover together like the mouth of the sack, and this kept\r\nthe snow out of the bag during the day's march. In this way we always\r\nkept ourselves free from the annoyance of drifting snow. We attached\r\ngreat importance to having the bags made of the very best sort of skin,\r\nand took care that the thin skin of the belly was removed. I have seen\r\nsleeping-bags of the finest reindeer-skin spoilt in a comparatively\r\nshort time if they contained a few patches of this thin skin, as\r\nof course the cold penetrates more easily through the thin skin,\r\nand gives rise to dampness in the form of rime on meeting the warmth\r\nof the body. These thin patches remain damp whenever one is in the\r\nbag, and in a short time they lose their hair. The damp spreads,\r\nlike decay in wood, and continually attacks the surrounding skin,\r\nwith the result that one fine day you find yourself with a hairless\r\nsleeping-bag. One cannot be too careful in the choice of skins. For\r\nthe sake of economy, the makers of reindeer-skin sleeping-bags are in\r\nthe habit of sewing them in such a way that the direction of the hair\r\nis towards the opening of the bag. Of course this suits the shape of\r\nthe skins best, but it does not suit the man who is going to use the\r\nbag. For it is no easy matter to crawl into a sleeping-bag which is\r\nonly just wide enough to allow one to get in, and if the way of the\r\nhair is against one it is doubly difficult. I had them all made as\r\none-man bags, with lacing round the neck; this did not, of course,\r\nmeet with the approval of all, as will be seen later. The upper\r\npart of this thick sleeping-bag was made of thinner reindeer-skin,\r\nso that we might be able to tie it closely round the neck; the thick\r\nskin will not draw so well and fit so closely as the thin.\r\n\r\nOur clothing in moderate temperatures consisted of thick woollen\r\nunderclothing and Burberry windproof overalls. This underclothing\r\nwas specially designed for the purpose; I had myself watched the\r\npreparation of the material, and knew that it contained nothing\r\nbut pure wool. We had overalls of two different materials: Burberry\r\n\"gabardine\" and the ordinary green kind that is used in Norway in the\r\nwinter. For sledge journeys, where one has to save weight, and to work\r\nin loose, easy garments, I must unhesitatingly recommend Burberry. It\r\nis extraordinarily light and strong, and keeps the wind completely\r\nout. For hard work I prefer the green kind. It keeps out the wind\r\nequally well, but is heavier and more bulky, and less comfortable\r\nto wear on a long march. Our Burberry wind-clothes were made in the\r\nform of anorak (blouse) and trousers, both very roomy. The others\r\nconsisted of trousers and jacket with hood.\r\n\r\nOur mits were for the most part such as one can buy in any shop; we\r\nwanted nothing else in and around winter quarters. Outside the mits\r\nwe wore an outer covering of windproof material, so as not to wear\r\nthem out too quickly. These mits are not very strong, though they are\r\ngood and warm. Besides these, we had ten pairs of ordinary kid mits,\r\nwhich were bought at a glove-shop in Christiania, and were practically\r\nimpossible to wear out. I wore mine from Framheim to the Pole and back\r\nagain, and afterwards on the voyage to Tasmania. The lining, of course,\r\nwas torn in places, but the seams of the mits were just as perfect as\r\nthe day I bought them. Taking into consideration the fact that I went\r\non ski the whole way and used two poles, it will be understood that\r\nthe mits were strongly made. We also had a number of woollen gloves,\r\nwhich, curiously enough, the others greatly prized. For myself, I was\r\nnever able to wear such things; they simply freeze the fingers off me.\r\n\r\nBut most important of all is the covering of the feet, for the feet\r\nare the most exposed members and the most difficult to protect. One\r\ncan look after the hands; if they grow cold it is easy to beat them\r\ninto warmth again. Not so with the feet; they are covered up in the\r\nmorning, and this is a sufficiently troublesome piece of work to make\r\none disinclined to undo it again until one is turning in. They cannot\r\nbe seen in the course of the day, and one has to depend entirely on\r\nfeeling; but feeling in this case often plays curious tricks. How\r\noften has it happened that men have had their feet\r\nfrozen off without knowing it! For if they had known it, they could not\r\npossibly have let it go so far. The fact is that in this case sensation\r\nis a somewhat doubtful guide, for the feet lose all sensation. It\r\nis true that there is a transitional stage, when one feels the\r\ncold smarting in one's toes, and tries to get rid of it by stamping\r\nthe feet. As a rule this is successful; the warmth returns, or the\r\ncirculation is restored; but it occasionally happens that sensation is\r\nlost at the very moment when these precautions are taken. And then one\r\nmust be an old hand to know what has happened. Many men conclude that,\r\nas they no longer feel the unpleasant smarting sensation, all is well;\r\nand at the evening inspection a frozen foot of tallow-like appearance\r\npresents itself. An event of this kind may ruin the most elaborately\r\nprepared enterprise, and it is therefore advisable in the matter of\r\nfeet to carry one's caution to lengths which may seem ridiculous.\r\n\r\nNow, it is a fact that if one can wear soft foot-gear exclusively\r\nthe risk of frost-bite is far less than if one is compelled to wear\r\nstiff boots; in soft foot-gear, of course, the foot can move far more\r\neasily and keep warm. But we were to take ski and to get full use\r\nout of them, so that in any case we had to have a stiff sole for the\r\nsake of the bindings. It is of no use to have a good binding unless\r\nyou can use it in the right way. In my opinion, on a long journey\r\nsuch as that we had before us, the ski must be perfectly steady. I\r\ndo not know anything that tires me more than a bad fastening -- that\r\nis, one that allows the foot to shift in the binding. I want the\r\nski to be a part of oneself, so that one always has full command of\r\nthem. I have tried many patents, for I have always been afraid of a\r\nstiff fastening in cold temperatures; but all these patents, without\r\nexception, are worthless in the long-run. I decided this time to\r\ntry a combination of stiff and soft foot-gear, so that we could use\r\nthe splendid Huitfeldt-Hoyer Ellefsen bindings; but this was no easy\r\nmatter. Of our whole outfit nothing caused me more worry or gave us\r\nall more work in the course of the expedition than the stiff outer\r\ncovering which we had to have; but we solved the problem at last. I\r\napplied to one of the leading makers of ski-boots in Christiania, and\r\nexplained the difficulty to him; fortunately I had found a man who\r\nwas evidently interested in the question. We agreed that he should\r\nmake a sample pair after the pattern of ski-boots. The sole was to\r\nbe thick and stiff -- for we had to be prepared to use crampons --\r\nbut the uppers as soft as possible. In order to avoid leather, which\r\nusually becomes stiff and easily cracked in the cold, he was to use\r\na combination of leather and thin canvas for the uppers -- leather\r\nnearest the sole, and canvas above it.\r\n\r\nThe measurements were taken from my foot, which is not exactly a\r\nchild's foot, with two pairs of reindeer-skin stockings on, and ten\r\npairs were made. I well remember seeing these boots in civilized\r\nChristiania. They were exhibited in the bootmaker's windows -- I\r\nused to go a long way round to avoid coming face to face with these\r\nmonsters in public. We are all a trifle vain, and dislike having our\r\nown shortcomings shown up in electric light. If I had ever cherished\r\nany illusions on the subject of \"a dainty little foot,\" I am sure the\r\nlast trace of such vanity died out on the day I passed the shoemaker's\r\nwindow and beheld my own boots. I never went that way again until\r\nI was certain that the exhibition was closed. One thing is certain,\r\nthat the boots were a fine piece of workmanship. We shall hear later\r\non of the alterations they had to undergo before we at last made them\r\nas large as we wanted, for the giant boots turned out much too small!\r\n\r\nAmong other equipment I must mention our excellent Primus cooking\r\napparatus. This all came complete from a firm in Stockholm. For cooking\r\non sledge journeys the Primus stove ranks above all others; it gives\r\na great deal of heat, uses little oil, and requires no attention --\r\nadvantages which are important enough anywhere, but especially when\r\nsledging. There is never any trouble with this apparatus; it has come\r\nas near perfection as possible. We took five Nansen cookers with\r\nus. This cooker utilizes the heat more completely than any other;\r\nbut I have one objection to make to it -- it takes up space. We used\r\nit on our depot journeys, but were unfortunately obliged to give it up\r\non the main southern journey. We were so many in a tent, and space was\r\nso limited, that I dared not risk using it. If one has room enough,\r\nit is ideal in my opinion.\r\n\r\nWe had with us ten pairs of snow-shoes and one hundred sets of\r\ndog-harness of the Alaska Eskimo pattern. The Alaska Eskimo drive\r\ntheir dogs in tandem; the whole pull is thus straight ahead in the\r\ndirection the sledge is going, and this is undoubtedly the best way of\r\nutilizing the power. I had made up my mind to adopt the same system\r\nin sledging on the Barrier. Another great advantage it had was that\r\nthe dogs would pass singly across fissures, so that the danger of\r\nfalling through was considerably reduced. The exertion of pulling is\r\nalso less trying with Alaska harness than with the Greenland kind,\r\nas the Alaska harness has a shallow, padded collar, which is slipped\r\nover the animal's head and makes the weight of the pull come on his\r\nshoulders, whereas the Greenland harness presses on his chest. Raw\r\nplaces, which occur rather frequently with the Greenland harness, are\r\nalmost entirely avoided with the other. All the sets of harness were\r\nmade in the navy workshops, and after their long and hard use they\r\nare as good as ever. There could be no better recommendation than this.\r\n\r\nOf instruments and apparatus for the sledge journeys we carried\r\ntwo sextants, three artificial horizons, of which two were glass\r\nhorizons with dark glasses, and one a mercury horizon, and four spirit\r\ncompasses, made in Christiania. They were excellent little compasses,\r\nbut unfortunately useless in cold weather -- that is to say, when the\r\ntemperature went below -40deg. F.; at this point the liquid froze. I had\r\ndrawn the maker's attention to this beforehand and asked him to use as\r\npure a spirit as possible. What his object was I still do not know,\r\nbut the spirit he employed was highly dilute. The best proof of this\r\nwas that the liquid in our compasses froze before the spirits in a\r\nflask. We were naturally inconvenienced by this. Besides these we had\r\nan ordinary little pocket-compass, two pairs of binoculars, one by\r\nZeiss and the other by Goertz, and snow-goggles from Dr. Schanz. We\r\nhad various kinds of glasses for these, so that we could change when\r\nwe were tired of one colour. During the whole stay on the Barrier I\r\nmyself wore a pair of ordinary spectacles with yellow glasses of quite\r\na light tint. These are prepared by a chemical process in such a way\r\nthat they nullify the harmful colours in the sun's rays. How excellent\r\nthese glasses are appears clearly enough from the fact that I never\r\nhad the slightest touch of snow-blindness on the southern journey,\r\nalthough the spectacles were perfectly open and allowed the light to\r\nenter freely everywhere. It will perhaps be suggested that I am less\r\nsusceptible to this ailment than others, but I know from personal\r\nexperience that such is not the case. I have previously had several\r\nsevere attacks of snow-blindness.\r\n\r\nWe had two photographic cameras, an air thermometer, two aneroids with\r\naltitude scale to 15,000 feet, and two hypsometers. The hypsometer\r\nis only an instrument for determining the boiling-point, which gives\r\none the height above the sea. The method is both simple and reliable.\r\n\r\nThe medical stores for sledging were given by a London firm,\r\nand the way in which the things were packed speaks for the whole\r\noutfit. There is not a speck of rust on needles, scissors, knives,\r\nor anything else, although they have been exposed to much damp. Our\r\nown medical outfit, which was bought in Christiania, and according\r\nto the vendor's statement unusually well packed, became in a short\r\ntime so damaged that the whole of it is now entirely spoilt.\r\n\r\nThe sledging provisions must be mentioned briefly. I have already\r\nspoken of the pemmican. I have never considered it necessary to\r\ntake a whole grocer's shop with me when sledging; the food should be\r\nsimple and nourishing, and that is enough -- a rich and varied menu\r\nis for people who have no work to do. Besides the pemmican, we had\r\nbiscuits, milk-powder, and chocolate. The biscuits were a present\r\nfrom a well-known Norwegian factory, and did all honour to their\r\norigin. They were specially baked for us, and were made of oatmeal with\r\nthe addition of dried milk and a little sugar; they were extremely\r\nnourishing and pleasant to the taste. Thanks to efficient packing,\r\nthey kept fresh and crisp all the time. These biscuits formed a great\r\npart of our daily diet, and undoubtedly contributed in no small degree\r\nto the successful result. Milk-powder is a comparatively new commodity\r\nwith us, but it deserves to be better known. It came from the district\r\nof Jaederen. Neither heat nor cold, dryness nor wet, could hurt it;\r\nwe had large quantities of it lying out in small, thin linen bags in\r\nevery possible state of the weather: the powder was as good the last\r\nday as the first. We also took dried milk from a firm in Wisconsin;\r\nthis milk had an addition of malt and sugar, and was, in my opinion,\r\nexcellent; it also kept good the whole time. The chocolate came from\r\na world-renowned firm, and was beyond all praise. The whole supply\r\nwas a very acceptable gift.\r\n\r\nWe are bringing all the purveyors of our sledging provisions samples\r\nof their goods that have made the journey to the South Pole and back,\r\nin gratitude for the kind assistance they afforded us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nOn the Way to the South\r\n\r\nThe month of May, 1910, ran its course, beautiful as only a spring\r\nmonth in Norway can be -- a lovely dream of verdure and flowers. But\r\nunfortunately we had little time to admire all the splendour that\r\nsurrounded us; our watchword was \"Away\" -- away from beautiful sights,\r\nas quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the month the Fram lay moored to her buoy\r\noutside the old walls of Akershus. Fresh and trim she came from the\r\nyard at Horten; you could see the shine on her new paint a long way\r\noff. Involuntarily one thought of holidays and yachting tours at the\r\nsight of her; but the thought was soon banished. The first day after\r\nher arrival, the vessel's deck assumed the most everyday appearance\r\nthat could be desired: the loading had begun.\r\n\r\nA long procession of cases of provisions made its way unceasingly\r\nfrom the basement of the Historical Museum down into the roomy hold\r\nof the Fram, where Lieutenant Nilsen and the three Nordlanders were\r\nready to receive them. This process was not an altogether simple one;\r\non the contrary, it was a very serious affair. It was not enough to\r\nknow that all the cases were duly on board; the problem was to know\r\nexactly where each particular case was placed, and, at the same time,\r\nto stow them all in such a way that they could easily be got at in\r\nfuture. This was a difficult piece of work, and it was not rendered\r\nany more easy by the attention that had to be paid to the numerous\r\nhatches leading down into the lower hold, where the big petroleum\r\ntanks stood. All these hatches had to be left accessible, otherwise\r\nwe should have been cut off from pumping the oil into the engine-room.\r\n\r\nHowever, Nilsen and his assistants accomplished their task with\r\nbrilliant success. Among the hundreds of cases there was not one that\r\nwas misplaced; not one that was stowed so that it could not instantly\r\nbe brought into the light of day.\r\n\r\nWhile the provisioning was going on, the rest of the equipment was\r\nalso being taken on board. Each member of the expedition was busily\r\nengaged in looking after the needs of his own department in the best\r\nway possible. Nor was this a question of trifles: one may cudgel one's\r\nbrains endlessly in advance, but some new requirement will constantly\r\nbe cropping up -- until one puts a full stop to it by casting off\r\nand sailing. This event was becoming imminent with the arrival of June.\r\n\r\nThe day before leaving Christiania we had the honour and pleasure\r\nof receiving a visit from the King and Queen of Norway on board the\r\nFram. Having been informed beforehand of their Majesties' coming, we\r\nendeavoured as far as possible to bring some order into the chaos that\r\nreigned on board. I do not know that we were particularly successful,\r\nbut I am sure that every one of the Fram's crew will always remember\r\nwith respectful gratitude King Haakon's cordial words of farewell.\r\n\r\nOn the same occasion the expedition received from their Majesties\r\nthe gift of a beautiful silver jug, which afterwards formed the most\r\nhandsome ornament of our table on every festive occasion.\r\n\r\nOn June 3, early in the forenoon, the Fram left Christiania, bound\r\nat first for my home on Bundefjord. The object of her call there was\r\nto take on board the house for the winter station, which stood ready\r\nbuilt in the garden. Our excellent carpenter Jorgen Stubberud had\r\nsuperintended the construction of this strong building. It was now\r\nrapidly taken to pieces, and every single plank and beam was carefully\r\nnumbered. We had quite an imposing pile of materials to get aboard,\r\nwhere even before there was not much room to spare. The bulk of it\r\nwas stowed forward, and the remainder in the hold.\r\n\r\nThe more experienced among the members of the expedition were evidently\r\nabsorbed in profound conjectures as to the meaning of this \"observation\r\nhouse,\" as the newspapers had christened it. It may willingly be\r\nadmitted that they had good reason for their speculations. By an\r\nobservation house is usually meant a comparatively simple construction,\r\nsufficient to provide the necessary shelter from wind and weather. Our\r\nhouse, on the other hand, was a model of solidity, with three double\r\nwalls, double roof and floor. Its arrangements included ten inviting\r\nbunks, a kitchener, and a table; the latter, moreover, had a brand-new\r\nAmerican-cloth cover. \"I can understand that they want to keep\r\nthemselves warm when they're making observations,\" said Helmer Hanssen;\r\n\"but what they want with a cloth on the table I can't make out.\"\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of June 6 it was announced that everything was ready,\r\nand in the evening we all assembled at a simple farewell supper in\r\nthe garden. I took the opportunity of wishing good luck to every man\r\nin turn, and finally we united in a\r\n\r\n\"God preserve the King and Fatherland!\"\r\n\r\nThen we broke up. The last man to get into the boat was the second\r\nin command; he arrived armed with a horseshoe. In his opinion it is\r\nquite incredible what luck an old horseshoe will bring. Possibly he\r\nis right. Anyhow, the horseshoe was firmly nailed to the mast in the\r\nFram's saloon, and there it still hangs.\r\n\r\nWhen on board, we promptly set to work to get up the anchor. The\r\nBolinder motor hummed, and the heavy cable rattled in through the\r\nhawse-hole. Precisely at midnight the anchor let go of the bottom,\r\nand just as the Seventh of June[3], rolled in over us, the Fram stood\r\nout of Christiania Fjord for the third time. Twice already had a band\r\nof stout-hearted men brought this ship back with honour after years\r\nof service. Would it be vouchsafed to us to uphold this honourable\r\ntradition? Such were, no doubt, the thoughts with which most of us\r\nwere occupied as our vessel glided over the motionless fjord in the\r\nlight summer night. The start was made under the sign of the Seventh\r\nof June, and this was taken as a promising omen; but among our bright\r\nand confident hopes there crept a shadow of melancholy. The hillsides,\r\nthe woods, the fjord -- all were so bewitchingly fair and so dear to\r\nus. They called to us with their allurement, but the Diesel motor knew\r\nno pity. Its tuff-tuff went on brutally through the stillness. A little\r\nboat, in which were some of my nearest relations, dropped gradually\r\nastern. There was a glimpse of white handkerchiefs in the twilight,\r\nand then -- farewell!\r\n\r\nThe next morning we were moored in the inner harbour at Horten. An\r\napparently innocent lighter came alongside at once, but the lighter's\r\ncargo was not quite so innocent as its appearance. It consisted\r\nof no less than half a ton of gun-cotton and rifle ammunition,\r\na somewhat unpleasant, but none the less necessary, item of our\r\nequipment. Besides taking on board the ammunition, we availed\r\nourselves of the opportunity of completing our water-supply. When\r\nthis was done, we lost no time in getting away. As we passed the\r\nwarships lying in the harbour they manned ship, and the bands played\r\nthe National Anthem. Outside Vealos we had the pleasure of waving a\r\nlast farewell to a man to whom the expedition will always owe a debt\r\nof gratitude, Captain Christian Blom, Superintendent of the dockyard,\r\nwho had supervised the extensive repairs to the Fram with unrelaxing\r\ninterest and obligingness. He slipped past us in his sailing-boat;\r\nI do not remember if he got a cheer. If he did not, it was a mistake.\r\n\r\nNow we were on our way to the South, as the heading of this\r\nchapter announces, though not yet in earnest. We had an additional\r\ntask before us: the oceanographical cruise in the Atlantic. This\r\nnecessitated a considerable detour on the way. The scientific results\r\nof this cruise will be dealt with by specialists in due course;\r\nif it is briefly referred to here, this is chiefly for the sake\r\nof continuity. After consultation with Professor Nansen, the plan\r\nwas to begin investigations in the region to the south of Ireland,\r\nand thence to work our way westward as far as time and circumstances\r\npermitted. The work was to be resumed on the homeward voyage in the\r\ndirection of the North of Scotland. For various reasons this programme\r\nafterwards had to be considerably reduced.\r\n\r\nFor the first few days after leaving Norway we were favoured with\r\nthe most splendid summer weather. The North Sea was as calm as a\r\nmillpond; the Fram had little more motion than when she was lying\r\nin Bundefjord. This was all the better for us, as we could hardly be\r\nsaid to be absolutely ready for sea when we passed Faerder, and came\r\ninto the capricious Skagerak. Hard pressed as we had been for time,\r\nit had not been possible to lash and stow the last of our cargo as\r\nsecurely as was desirable; a stiff breeze at the mouth of the fjord\r\nwould therefore have been rather inconvenient. As it was, everything\r\nwas arranged admirably, but to do this we had to work night and day. I\r\nhave been told that on former occasions sea-sickness made fearful\r\nravages on board the Fram, but from this trial we also had an easy\r\nescape. Nearly all the members of the expedition were used to the sea,\r\nand the few who, perhaps, were not so entirely proof against it had a\r\nwhole week of fine weather to get into training. So far as I know, not\r\na single case occurred of this unpleasant and justly dreaded complaint.\r\n\r\nAfter passing the Dogger Bank we had a very welcome north-east breeze;\r\nwith the help of the sails we could now increase the not very reckless\r\nspeed that the motor was capable of accomplishing. Before we sailed,\r\nthe most contradictory accounts were current of the Fram's sailing\r\nqualities. There were some who asserted that the ship could not be\r\ngot through the water at all, while with equal force the contrary\r\nview was maintained -- that she was a notable fast sailer. As might\r\nbe supposed, the truth as usual lay about half-way between these two\r\nextremes. The ship was no racer, nor was she an absolute log. We\r\nran before the north-east wind towards the English Channel at a\r\nspeed of about seven knots, and with that we were satisfied for the\r\ntime being. The important question for us was whether we should keep\r\nthe favourable wind till we were well through the Straits of Dover,\r\nand, preferably, a good way down Channel. Our engine power was far\r\ntoo limited to make it of any use trying to go against the wind,\r\nand we should have been obliged in that case to have recourse to the\r\nsailing-ship's method -- beating. Tacking in the English Channel -- the\r\nbusiest part of the world's seas -- is in itself no very pleasant work;\r\nfor us it would be so much the worse, as it would greatly encroach on\r\nthe time that could be devoted to oceanographical investigations. But\r\nthe east wind held with praiseworthy steadiness. In the course of a\r\nfew days we were through the Channel, and about a week after leaving\r\nNorway we were able to take the first oceanographical station at the\r\npoint arranged according to the plan. Hitherto everything had gone\r\nas smoothly as we could wish, but now, for a change, difficulties\r\nbegan to appear, first in the form of unfavourable weather When the\r\nnorth-wester begins to blow in the North Atlantic, it is generally a\r\ngood while before it drops again, and this time it did not belie its\r\nreputation. Far from getting to the westward, we were threatened for\r\na time with being driven on to the Irish coast. It was not quite so\r\nbad as that, but we soon found ourselves obliged to shorten the route\r\noriginally laid down very considerably. A contributing cause of this\r\ndetermination was the fact that the motor was out of order. Whether it\r\nwas the fault of the oil or a defect in the engine itself our engineer\r\nwas not clear. It was therefore necessary to make for home in good\r\ntime, in case of extensive repairs being required. In spite of these\r\ndifficulties, we had a quite respectable collection of samples of\r\nwater and temperatures at different depths before we set our course\r\nfor Norway at the beginning of July, with Bergen as our destination.\r\n\r\nDuring the passage from the Pentland Firth we had a violent gale from\r\nthe north, which gave us an opportunity of experiencing how the Fram\r\nbehaved in bad weather. The trial was by no means an easy one. It\r\nwas blowing a gale, with a cross sea; we kept going practically\r\nunder full sail, and had the satisfaction of seeing our ship make\r\nover nine knots. In the rather severe rolling the collar of the mast\r\nin the fore-cabin was loosened a little; this let the water in, and\r\nthere was a slight flooding of Lieutenant Nilsen's cabin and mine. The\r\nothers, whose berths were to port, were on the weather side, and kept\r\ndry. We came out of it all with the loss of a few boxes of cigars,\r\nwhich were wet through. They were not entirely lost for all that;\r\nRonne took charge of them, and regaled himself with salt and mouldy\r\ncigars for six months afterwards. Going eight or nine knots an hour,\r\nwe did not make much of the distance between Scotland and Norway. On\r\nthe afternoon of Saturday, July 9, the wind dropped, and at the same\r\ntime the lookout reported land in sight. This was Siggen on Bommelo. In\r\nthe course of the night we came under the coast, and on Sunday morning,\r\nJuly 10, we ran into Saelbjomsfjord. We had no detailed chart of this\r\ninlet, but after making a great noise with our powerful air-siren,\r\nwe at last roused the inmates of the pilot-station, and a pilot\r\ncame aboard. He showed visible signs of surprise when he found out,\r\nby reading the name on the ship's side, that it was the Fram he had\r\nbefore him. \"Lord, I thought you were a Russian!\" he exclaimed. This\r\nsupposition was presumably intended to serve as a sort of excuse for\r\nhis small hurry in coming on board.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely trip through the fjords to Bergen, as warm and\r\npleasant in here as it had been bitter and cold outside. We had a\r\ndead calm all day, and with the four knots an hour, which was all\r\nthe motor could manage, it was late in the evening when we anchored\r\noff the naval dockyard in Solheimsvik. Our stay in Bergen happened\r\nat the time of the exhibition, and the committee paid the expedition\r\nthe compliment of giving all its members free passes.\r\n\r\nBusiness of one kind and another compelled me to go to Christiania,\r\nleaving the Fram in charge of Lieutenant Nilsen. They had their\r\nhands more than full on board. Diesel's firm in Stockholm sent their\r\nexperienced fitter, Aspelund, who at once set to work to overhaul the\r\nmotor thoroughly. The work that had to be done was executed gratis by\r\nthe Laxevaag engineering works. After going into the matter thoroughly,\r\nit was decided to change the solar oil we had on board for refined\r\npetroleum. Through the courtesy of the West of Norway Petroleum\r\nCompany, we got this done on very favourable terms at the company's\r\nstorage dock in Skaalevik. This was troublesome work, but it paid in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nThe samples of water from our trip were taken to the biological\r\nstation, where Kutschin at once went to work with the filtering\r\n(determination of the proportion of chlorine).\r\n\r\nOur German shipmate, the oceanographer Schroer, left us at Bergen. On\r\nJuly 23 the Fram left Bergen, and arrived on the following day at\r\nChristiansand, where I met her. Here we again had a series of busy\r\ndays. In one of the Custom-house warehouses were piled a quantity\r\nof things that had to go on board: no less than 400 bundles of dried\r\nfish, all our ski and sledging outfit, a waggon-load of timber, etc. At\r\nFredriksholm, out on Flekkero, we had found room for perhaps the most\r\nimportant of all -- the passengers, the ninety-seven Eskimo dogs,\r\nwhich had arrived from Greenland in the middle of July on the steamer\r\nHans Egede. The ship had had a rather long and rough passage, and the\r\ndogs were not in very good condition on their arrival, but they had\r\nnot been many days on the island under the supervision of Hassel and\r\nLindstrom before they were again in full vigour. A plentiful supply\r\nof fresh meat worked wonders. The usually peaceful island, with the\r\nremains of the old fortress, resounded day by day, and sometimes at\r\nnight, with the most glorious concerts of howling. These musical\r\nperformances attracted a number of inquisitive visitors, who were\r\nanxious to submit the members of the chorus to a closer examination,\r\nand therefore, at certain times, the public were admitted to see the\r\nanimals. It soon turned out that the majority of the dogs, far from\r\nbeing ferocious or shy, were, on the contrary, very appreciative of\r\nthese visits. They sometimes came in for an extra tit-bit in the form\r\nof a sandwich or something of the sort. Besides which, it was a little\r\ndiversion in their life of captivity, so uncongenial to an Arctic dog;\r\nfor every one of them was securely chained up. This was necessary,\r\nespecially to prevent fighting among themselves. It happened not\r\ninfrequently that one or more of them got loose, but the two guardians\r\nwere always ready to capture the runaways. One enterprising rascal\r\nstarted to swim over the sound to the nearest land -- the object of\r\nhis expedition was undoubtedly certain unsuspecting sheep that were\r\ngrazing by the shore -- but his swim was interrupted in time.\r\n\r\nAfter the Fram's arrival Wisting took over the position of dog-keeper\r\nin Hassel's place. He and Lindstrom stayed close to the island where\r\nthe dogs were. Wisting had a way of his own with his four-footed\r\nsubjects, and was soon on a confidential footing with them. He also\r\nshowed himself to be possessed of considerable veterinary skill -- an\r\nexceedingly useful qualification in this case, where there was often\r\nsome injury or other to be attended to. As I have already mentioned,\r\nup to this time no member of the expedition, except Lieutenant Nilsen,\r\nknew anything of the extension of plan that had been made. Therefore,\r\namongst the things that came on board, and amongst the preparations\r\nthat were made during our stay at Christiansand, there must have\r\nbeen a great deal that appeared very strange to those who, for the\r\npresent, were only looking forward to a voyage round Cape Horn to San\r\nFrancisco. What was the object of taking all these dogs on board and\r\ntransporting them all that long way? And if it came to that, would any\r\nof them survive the voyage round the formidable promontory? Besides,\r\nwere there not dogs enough, and good dogs too, in Alaska? Why was\r\nthe whole after-deck full of coal? What was the use of all these\r\nplanks and boards? Would it not have been much more convenient to\r\ntake all that kind of goods on board in 'Frisco? These and many\r\nsimilar questions began to pass from man to man; indeed, their very\r\nfaces began to resemble notes of interrogation. Not that anyone asked\r\nme -- far from it; it was the second in command who had to bear the\r\nbrunt and answer as well as he could -- an extremely thankless and\r\nunpleasant task for a man who already had his hands more than full.\r\n\r\nIn order to relieve his difficult situation, I resolved, shortly before\r\nleaving Christiansand, to inform Lieutenants Prestrud and Gjertsen\r\nof the true state of affairs. After having signed an undertaking of\r\nsecrecy, they received full information of the intended dash to the\r\nSouth Pole, and an explanation of the reasons for keeping the whole\r\nthing secret. When asked whether they wished to take part in the\r\nnew plan, they both answered at once in the affirmative, and that\r\nsettled it.\r\n\r\nThere were now three men on board -- all the officers -- who were\r\nacquainted with the situation, and were thus in a position to parry\r\ntroublesome questions and remove possible anxieties on the part of\r\nthe uninitiated.\r\n\r\nTwo of the members of the expedition joined during the stay at\r\nChristiansand -- Hassel and Lindstrom -- and one change was made:\r\nthe engineer Eliassen was discharged. It was no easy matter to find\r\na man who possessed the qualifications for taking over the post of\r\nengineer to the Fram. Few, or perhaps no one, in Norway could be\r\nexpected to have much knowledge of motors of the size of ours. The\r\nonly thing to be done was to go to the place where the engine was\r\nbuilt -- to Sweden. Diesel's firm in Stockholm helped us out of the\r\ndifficulty; they sent us the man, and it afterwards turned out that\r\nhe was the right man. Knut Sundbeck was his name. A chapter might be\r\nwritten on the good work that man did, and the quiet, unostentatious\r\nway in which he did it. From the very beginning he had assisted in\r\nthe construction of the Fram's motor, so that he knew his engine\r\nthoroughly. He treated it as his darling; therefore there was never\r\nanything the matter with it. It may truly be said that he did honour\r\nto his firm and the nation to which he belongs.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we were hard at work, getting ready to sail. We decided to\r\nleave before the middle of August -- the sooner the better.\r\n\r\nThe Fram had been in dry dock, where the hull was thoroughly coated\r\nwith composition. Heavily laden as the ship was, the false keel was\r\na good deal injured by the severe pressure on the blocks, but with\r\nthe help of a diver the damage was quickly made good.\r\n\r\nThe many hundred bundles of dried fish were squeezed into the main\r\nhold, full as it was. All sledging and ski outfit was carefully stowed\r\naway, so as to be protected as far as possible from damp. These\r\nthings had to be kept dry, otherwise they, would become warped and\r\nuseless. Bjaaland had charge of this outfit, and he knew how it should\r\nbe treated.\r\n\r\nAs is right and proper, when all the goods had been shipped, it was\r\nthe turn of the passengers. The Fram was anchored off Fredriksholm,\r\nand the necessary preparations were immediately made for receiving\r\nour four-footed friends. Under the expert direction of\r\n\r\nBjaaland and Stubberud, as many as possible of the crew were set to\r\nwork with axe and saw, and in the course of a few hours the Fram had\r\ngot a new deck. This consisted of loose pieces of decking, which could\r\neasily be raised and removed for flushing and cleaning. This false\r\ndeck rested on three-inch planks nailed to the ship's deck; between\r\nthe latter and the loose deck there was therefore a considerable space,\r\nthe object of which was a double one -- namely, to let the water, which\r\nwould unavoidably be shipped on such a voyage, run off rapidly, and\r\nto allow air to circulate, and thus keep the space below the animals\r\nas cool as possible. The arrangement afterwards proved very successful.\r\n\r\nThe bulwarks on the fore-part of the Fram's deck consisted of an iron\r\nrailing covered with wire-netting. In order to provide both shade and\r\nshelter from the wind, a lining of boards was now put up along the\r\ninside of the railing, and chains were fastened in all possible and\r\nimpossible places to tie the dogs up to. There could be no question of\r\nletting them go loose -- to begin with, at any rate; possibly, we might\r\nhope to be able to set them free later on, when they knew their masters\r\nbetter and were more familiar with their surroundings generally.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon of August 9 we were ready to receive our new\r\nshipmates, and they were conveyed across from the island in a big\r\nlighter, twenty at a time. Wisting and Lindstrom superintended the\r\nwork of transport, and maintained order capitally. They had succeeded\r\nin gaining the dogs' confidence, and at the same time their complete\r\nrespect  -- just what was wanted, in fact. At the Fram's gangway the\r\ndogs came in for an active and determined reception, and before they\r\nhad recovered from their surprise and fright, they were securely\r\nfastened on deck and given to understand with all politeness that\r\nthe best thing they could do for the time being was to accept the\r\nsituation with calmness. The whole proceeding went so rapidly that\r\nin the course of a couple of hours we had all the ninety-seven dogs\r\non board and had found room for them; but it must be added that the\r\nFram's deck was utilized to the utmost. We had thought we should be\r\nable to keep the bridge free, but this could not be done if we were\r\nto take them all with us. The last boat-load, fourteen in number, had\r\nto be accommodated there. All that was left was a little free space\r\nfor the man at the wheel. As for the officer of the watch, it looked\r\nas if he would be badly off for elbow-room; there was reason to fear\r\nthat he would be compelled to kill time by standing stock-still in\r\none spot through the whole watch; but just then there was no time for\r\nsmall troubles of this sort. No sooner was the last dog on board than\r\nwe set about putting all visitors ashore, and then the motor began\r\nworking the windlass under the forecastle. \"The anchor's up!\" Full\r\nspeed ahead, and the voyage towards our goal, 16,000 miles away,\r\nwas begun. Quietly and unobserved we went out of the fjord at dusk;\r\na few of our friends accompanied us out.\r\n\r\nAfter the pilot had left us outside Flekkero, it was not long before\r\nthe darkness of the August evening hid the outlines of the country\r\nfrom our view; but Oxo and Ryvingen flashed their farewells to us\r\nall through the night.\r\n\r\nWe had been lucky with wind and weather at the commencement of our\r\nAtlantic cruise in the early summer; this time we were, if possible,\r\neven more favoured. It was perfectly calm when we sailed, and the\r\nNorth Sea lay perfectly calm for several days after. What we had\r\nto do now was to become familiar with and used to, all these dogs,\r\nand this was enormously facilitated by the fact that for the first\r\nweek we experienced nothing but fine weather.\r\n\r\nBefore we sailed there was no lack of all kinds of prophecies of the\r\nevil that would befall us with our dogs. We heard a number of these\r\npredictions; presumably a great many more were whispered about, but\r\ndid not reach our ears. The unfortunate beasts were to fare terribly\r\nbadly. The heat of the tropics would make short work of the greater\r\npart of them. If any were left, they would have but a miserable respite\r\nbefore being washed overboard or drowned in the seas that would come\r\non deck in the west wind belt. To keep them alive with a few bits of\r\ndried fish was an impossibility, etc.\r\n\r\nAs everyone knows, all these predictions were very far from being\r\nfulfilled; the exact opposite happened. Since then I expect most of us\r\nwho made the trip have been asked the question -- Was not that voyage\r\nto the South an excessively wearisome and tedious business? Didn't\r\nyou get sick of all those dogs? How on earth did you manage to keep\r\nthem alive?\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that a five months' voyage in such waters as we\r\nwere navigating must necessarily present a good deal of monotony; how\r\nmuch will depend on what resources one has for providing occupation. In\r\nthis respect we had in these very dogs just what was wanted. No doubt\r\nit was work that very often called for the exercise of patience;\r\nnevertheless, like any other work, it furnished diversion and\r\namusement, and so much the more since we here had to deal with living\r\ncreatures that had sense enough fully to appreciate and reciprocate\r\nin their own way any advance that was made to them.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first I tried in every way to insist upon the paramount\r\nimportance to our whole enterprise of getting our draught animals\r\nsuccessfully conveyed to our destination. If we had any watchword at\r\nthis time it was: \"Dogs first, and dogs all the time.\" The result\r\nspeaks best for the way in which this watchword was followed. The\r\nfollowing was the arrangement we made: The dogs, who at first were\r\nalways tied up on the same spot, were divided into parties of ten; to\r\neach party one or two keepers were assigned, with full responsibility\r\nfor their animals and their treatment. For my own share I took the\r\nfourteen that lived on the bridge. Feeding the animals was a manoeuvre\r\nthat required the presence of all hands on deck; it therefore took\r\nplace when the watch was changed. The Arctic dog's greatest enjoyment\r\nin life is putting away his food; it may be safely asserted that\r\nthe way to his heart lies through his dish of meat. We acted on this\r\nprinciple, and the result did not disappoint us. After the lapse of\r\na few days the different squads were the best of friends with their\r\nrespective keepers.\r\n\r\nAs may be supposed, it was not altogether to the taste of the dogs to\r\nstand chained up all the time; their temperament is far too lively for\r\nthat. We would gladly have allowed them the pleasure of running about\r\nand thus getting healthy exercise, but for the present we dared not run\r\nthe risk of letting the whole pack loose. A little more education was\r\nrequired first. It was easy enough to win their affection; to provide\r\nthem with a good education was of course a more difficult matter. It\r\nwas quite touching to see their joy and gratitude when one gave up\r\na little time to their entertainment. One's first meeting with them\r\nin the morning was specially cordial. Their feelings were then apt\r\nto find vent in a chorus of joyful howls; this was called forth by\r\nthe very sight of their masters, but they asked more than that. They\r\nwere not satisfied until we had gone round, patting and talking to\r\nevery one. If by chance one was so careless as to miss a dog, he at\r\nonce showed the most unmistakable signs of disappointment.\r\n\r\nThere can hardly be an animal that is capable of expressing its\r\nfeelings to the same extent as the dog. Joy, sorrow, gratitude,\r\nscruples of conscience, are all reflected as plainly as could be\r\ndesired in his behaviour, and above all in his eyes. We human beings\r\nare apt to cherish the conviction that we have a monopoly of what is\r\ncalled a living soul; the eyes, it is said, are the mirror of this\r\nsoul. That is all right enough; but now take a look at a dog's eyes,\r\nstudy them attentively. How often do we see something \"human\" in their\r\nexpression, the same variations that we meet with in human eyes. This,\r\nat all events, is something that strikingly resembles \"soul.\" We will\r\nleave the question open for those who are interested in its solution,\r\nand will here only mention another point, which seems to show that\r\na dog is something more than a mere machine of flesh and blood --\r\nhis pronounced individuality. There were about a hundred dogs on\r\nboard the Fram. Gradually, as we got to know each one of them by\r\ndaily intercourse, they each revealed some characteristic trait, some\r\npeculiarity. Hardly two of them were alike, either in disposition or\r\nin appearance. To an observant eye there was here ample opportunity\r\nfor the most amusing exercise. If now and then one grew a little\r\ntired of one's fellow-men -- which, I must admit, seldom happened --\r\nthere was, as a rule, diversion to be found in the society of the\r\nanimals. I say, as a rule; there were, of course, exceptions. It was\r\nnot an unmixed pleasure having the whole deck full of dogs for all\r\nthose months; our patience was severely tested many a time. But in\r\nspite of all the trouble and inconvenience to which the transport of\r\nthe dogs necessarily gave rise, I am certainly right in saying that\r\nthese months of sea voyage would have seemed far more monotonous and\r\ntedious if we had been without our passengers.\r\n\r\nDuring the first four or five days we had now been making our way\r\ntowards the Straits of Dover, and the hope began to dawn within us\r\nthat this time, as last, we should slip through without any great\r\ndifficulty. There had been five days of absolute calm; why should it\r\nnot last out the week? But it did not. As we passed the lightship at\r\nthe western end of the Goodwins the fine weather left us, and in its\r\nplace came the south-west wind with rain, fog, and foul weather in\r\nits train. In the course of half an hour it became so thick that it\r\nwas impossible to see more than two or three ship's lengths ahead;\r\nbut if we could see nothing, we heard all the more. The ceaseless\r\nshrieks of many steam-whistles and sirens told us only too plainly\r\nwhat a crowd of vessels we were in. It was not exactly a pleasant\r\nsituation; our excellent ship had many good points, but they did not\r\nprevent her being extraordinarily slow and awkward in turning. This is\r\nan element of great danger in these waters. It must be remembered that\r\na possible accident -- whether our own fault or not -- would to us be\r\nabsolutely fatal. We had so little time to spare that the resulting\r\ndelay might ruin the whole enterprise. An ordinary trading vessel can\r\ntake the risk; by careful manoeuvring a skipper can almost always keep\r\nout of the way. Collisions are, as a rule, the result of rashness\r\nor carelessness on one side or the other. The rash one has to pay;\r\nthe careful one may perhaps make money out of it. Carefulness on our\r\npart was a matter of course; it would have been a poor consolation\r\nto us if another ship had had to pay for her carelessness. We could\r\nnot take that risk; therefore, little as we liked doing so, we put\r\ninto the Downs and anchored there.\r\n\r\nRight opposite to us we had the town of Deal, then in the height\r\nof its season. The only amusement we had was to observe all these\r\napparently unconcerned people, who passed their time in bathing, or\r\nwalking about the white, inviting sands. They had no need to worry\r\nthemselves much about what quarter the wind blew from. Our only wish\r\nwas that it would veer, or in any case drop. Our communication with\r\nthe land was limited to sending ashore telegrams and letters for home.\r\n\r\nBy the next morning our patience was already quite exhausted, but\r\nnot so with the south-wester. It kept going as steadily as ever,\r\nbut it was clear weather, and therefore we decided at once to make\r\nan attempt to get to the west. There was nothing to be done but\r\nto have recourse to the ancient method of beating. We cleared one\r\npoint, and then another, but more than that we could not manage for\r\nthe time being. We took one bearing after another; no, there was no\r\nvisible progress. Off Dungeness we had to anchor again, and once more\r\nconsole ourselves with the much-vaunted balm of patience. This time\r\nwe escaped with passing the night there. The wind now thought fit to\r\nveer sufficiently to let us get out at daybreak, but it was still a\r\ncontrary wind, and we had to beat almost all the way down the English\r\nChannel. A whole week was spent in doing these three hundred miles;\r\nthat was rather hard, considering the distance we had to go.\r\n\r\nI fancy most of us gave a good sigh of relief when at last we were\r\nclear of the Scilly Isles. The everlasting south-west wind was still\r\nblowing, but that did not matter so much now. The main thing was\r\nthat we found ourselves in open sea with the whole Atlantic before\r\nus. Perhaps one must have sailed in the Fram to be able fully to\r\nunderstand what a blessing it was to feel ourselves altogether clear\r\nof the surrounding land and the many sailing-ships in the Channel --\r\nto say nothing of constantly working the ship with a deck swarming with\r\ndogs. On our first voyage through the Channel in June we had caught\r\ntwo or three carrier pigeons, which had come to rest in the rigging\r\nutterly tired out. On the approach of darkness we were able to get\r\nhold of them without difficulty. Their numbers and marks were noted,\r\nand after they had been taken care of for a couple of days and had\r\nrecovered their strength, we let them go. They circled once or twice\r\nround the mast-heads, and then made for the English coast.\r\n\r\nI think this episode led to our taking a few carrier pigeons with us\r\nwhen we left Christiansand; Lieutenant Nilsen, as a former owner of\r\npigeons, was to take charge of them. Then a nice house was made for\r\nthem, and the pigeons lived happily in their new abode on the top\r\nof the whale-boat amidships. Now, in some way or other the second\r\nin command found out that the circulation of air in the pigeon-house\r\nwas faulty; to remedy this defect, he one day set the door a little\r\najar. Air certainly got into the house, but the pigeons came out. A\r\njoker, on discovering that the birds had flown, wrote up \"To Let\"\r\nin big letters on the wall of the pigeon-house. The second in command\r\nwas not in a very gentle frame of mind that day.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, this escape took place in the Channel. The pigeons\r\nfound their way home to Norway.\r\n\r\nThe Bay of Biscay has a bad name among seamen, and it fully deserves\r\nit; that tempestuous corner of the sea conceals for ever in its\r\ndepths so many a stout ship and her crew. We for our part, however,\r\nhad good hopes of escaping unharmed, considering the time of year,\r\nand our hopes were fulfilled. We had better luck than we dared to\r\nanticipate. Our stubborn opponent, the south-west wind, got tired at\r\nlast of trying to stop our progress; it was no use. We went slowly,\r\nit was true, but still we got along. Of the meteorological lessons\r\nof our youth, we especially recalled at that moment the frequent\r\nnortherly winds off the coast of Portugal, and as a pleasant surprise\r\nwe already had them far up in the Bay. This was an agreeable change\r\nafter all our close-hauled tacking in the Channel. The north wind held\r\nalmost as bravely as the south-west had done before, and at what was\r\nto our ideas quite a respectable rate, we went southward day after day\r\ntowards the fine-weather zone, where we could be sure of a fair wind,\r\nand where a sailor's life is, as a rule, a pleasant one.\r\n\r\nFor that matter, as far as seamanship was concerned, our work\r\nhad gone on smoothly enough, even during these first difficult\r\nweeks. There were always willing and practised hands enough for what\r\nwas wanted, even though the work to be done was frequently of a not\r\nvery pleasant kind. Take washing decks, for instance. Every seaman\r\nwill have something to say about what this is like on board ships\r\nthat carry live animals, especially when these are carried on deck,\r\nin the way of all work that has to be done. I have always held the\r\nopinion that a Polar ship ought not, any more than any other vessel,\r\nto be a wholesale establishment for dirt and filth, however many dogs\r\nthere may be on board. On the contrary, I should say that on voyages\r\nof this kind it is more than ever vitally necessary to keep one's\r\nsurroundings as clean and sweet as possible. The important thing is\r\nto get rid of anything that may have a demoralizing and depressing\r\neffect. The influence of uncleanliness in this way is so well known\r\nthat it is needless to preach about it here.\r\n\r\nMy views were shared by everyone on board the Fram, and everything\r\nwas done to act in accordance with them, in spite of what may\r\nbe considered great difficulties. Twice a day the whole deck was\r\nthoroughly washed down, besides all the extra turns at odd times with\r\nbucket and scrubber. At least once a week the whole of the loose deck\r\nwas taken up, and each separate part of it thoroughly washed, until\r\nit was as clean as when it was laid down at Christiansand. This was\r\na labour that required great patience and perseverance on the part of\r\nthose who had to perform it, but I never saw any shortcomings. \"Let's\r\njust see and get it clean,\" they said.\r\n\r\nAt night, when it was not always easy to see what one was doing,\r\nit might often happen that one heard some more or less heated\r\nexclamations from those who had to handle coils of rope in working\r\nthe ship. I need not hint more explicitly at the cause of them,\r\nif it is remembered that there were dogs lying about everywhere,\r\nwho had eaten and drunk well in the course of the day. But after a\r\ntime the oaths gave way to jokes. There is nothing in the world that\r\ncustom does not help us to get over.\r\n\r\nIt is the universal practice on board ship to divide the day and\r\nnight into watches of four hours; the two watches into which the\r\ncrew is divided relieve each other every four hours. But on vessels\r\nthat sail to the Arctic Ocean, it is customary to have watches of six\r\nhours. We adopted the latter plan, which, on its being put to the vote,\r\nproved to have a compact majority in its favour. By this arrangement\r\nof watches we only had to turn out twice in the course of twenty-four\r\nhours, and the watch below had had a proper sleep whenever it turned\r\nout. If one has to eat, smoke, and perhaps chat a little during four\r\nhours' watch below, it does not leave much time for sleeping; and if\r\nthere should be a call for all hands on deck, it means no sleep at all.\r\n\r\nTo cope with the work of the engine-room, we had from the beginning the\r\ntwo engineers, Sundbeck and Nodtvedt; they took watch and watch, four\r\nhours each. When the motor was in use for a long time continuously,\r\nthis was a rather severe duty, and on the whole it was just as well\r\nto have a man in reserve. I therefore decided to have a third man\r\ntrained as reserve engineer. Kristensen applied for this post, and it\r\nmay be said in his praise that he accomplished the change remarkably\r\nwell. Thorough deck-hand as he was, there might have been reason to\r\nfear that he would repent of the transfer; but no, he quickly became\r\nlife and soul an engineer. This did not prevent our seeing him on\r\ndeck again many a time during the passage through the west wind belt,\r\nwhen there was need of a good man during a gale.\r\n\r\nThe motor, which during the Atlantic cruise had been a constant source\r\nof uneasiness and anxiety, regained our entire confidence under\r\nSundbeck's capable command; it hummed so that it was a pleasure to\r\nhear it. To judge from the sound of the engine-room, one would have\r\nthought the Fram was moving through the water with the speed of a\r\ntorpedo-boat. If this was not the case, the engine was not to blame;\r\npossibly, the screw had a share of it. The latter ought probably\r\nto have been somewhat larger, though experts are not agreed about\r\nthis; in any case, there was something radically wrong with our\r\npropeller. Whenever there was a little seaway, it was apt to work\r\nloose in the brasses. This disadvantage is of very common occurrence\r\nin vessels which have to be fitted with lifting propellers on account\r\nof the ice, and we did not escape it. The only remedy was to lift the\r\nwhole propeller-frame and renew the brasses -- an extremely difficult\r\nwork when it had to be done in the open sea and on as lively a ship\r\nas the Fram.\r\n\r\nDay by day we had the satisfaction of seeing how the dogs found\r\nthemselves more and more at home on board. Perhaps, even among\r\nourselves, there were one or two who had felt some doubt at first\r\nof what the solution of the dog question would be, but in any case\r\nall such doubts were soon swept away. Even at an early stage of the\r\nvoyage we had every reason to hope that we should land our animals\r\nsafe and sound. What we had to see to in the first place was to let\r\nthem have as much and as good food as circumstances permitted. As\r\nalready mentioned, we had provided ourselves with dried fish for their\r\nconsumption. Eskimo dogs do not suffer very greatly from daintiness,\r\nbut an exclusive diet of dried fish would seem rather monotonous\r\nin the long-run, even to their appetites, and a certain addition of\r\nfatty substances was necessary, otherwise we should have some trouble\r\nwith them. We had on board several great barrels of tallow or fat,\r\nbut our store was not so large that we did not have to economize. In\r\norder to make the supply of fat last, and at the same time to induce\r\nour boarders to take as much dried fish as possible, we invented a\r\nmixture which was called by a sailor's term -- daenge. This must not\r\nbe confused with \"thrashing,\"[4] which was also served out liberally\r\nfrom time to time, but the daenge was more in demand. It consisted\r\nof a mixture of chopped-up fish, tallow, and maize-meal, all boiled\r\ntogether into a sort of porridge. This dish was served three times\r\na week, and the dogs were simply mad for it. They very soon learned\r\nto keep count of the days when this mess was to be expected, and\r\nas soon as they heard the rattling of the tin dishes in which the\r\nseparate portions were carried round, they set up such a noise that\r\nit was impossible to hear oneself speak. Both the preparation and the\r\nserving out of this extra ration were at times rather troublesome,\r\nbut it was well worth it. It is quite certain that our complement of\r\ndogs would have made a poor show on arrival at the Bay of Whales if\r\nwe had shrunk from the trouble.\r\n\r\nThe dried fish was not nearly so popular as the daenge, but to make up\r\nfor that there was plenty of it. Not that the dogs themselves ever\r\nthought they could have enough; indeed, they were always stealing\r\nfrom their neighbours, perhaps more for the sake of the sport than\r\nfor anything else. In any case, as a sport it was extremely popular,\r\nand it took many a good hiding to get the rascals to understand\r\nthat it could not be allowed. I am afraid, though, that they kept\r\nup their thieving even after they knew very well that it was wrong;\r\nthe habit was too old to be corrected. Another habit, and a very bad\r\none, that these Eskimo dogs have fallen into in the course of ages,\r\nand of which we tried to break them, at all events during the sea\r\nvoyage, is their tendency to hold howling concerts. What the real\r\nmeaning of these performances may be, whether they are a pastime, or\r\nan expression of gratification or the reverse, we could never decide\r\nto our satisfaction. They began suddenly and without warning. The\r\nwhole pack might be lying perfectly still and quiet, when a single\r\nindividual, who for that occasion had taken upon himself the part of\r\nleader of the chorus, would set up a long, blood-curdling yowl. If\r\nthey were left to themselves, it was not long before the whole pack\r\njoined in, and this infernal din was kept going at full steam for two\r\nor three minutes. The only amusing thing about the entertainment was\r\nits conclusion. They all stopped short at the same instant, just as\r\na well-trained chorus obeys the baton of its conductor. Those of us,\r\nhowever, who happened to be in our bunks, found nothing at all amusing\r\nin these concerts, either in the finale or anything else, for they\r\nwere calculated to tear the soundest sleeper from his slumbers. But if\r\none only took care to stop the leader in his efforts the whole affair\r\nwas nipped in the bud, and we usually succeeded in doing this. If\r\nthere were some who at first were anxious about their night's rest,\r\nthese fears were soon dispersed.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Norway we had ninety-seven dogs in all, and of these no\r\nless than ten were bitches. This fact justified us in expecting an\r\nincrease of the canine population on our voyage to the South, and\r\nour expectations were very soon fulfilled. The first \"happy event\r\n\" occurred when we had been no more than three weeks at sea. An\r\nincident of this kind may seem in itself of no great importance; to\r\nus, living under conditions in which one day was almost exactly like\r\nanother, it was more than enough to be an object of the greatest\r\ninterest. Therefore, when the report went round that \"Camilla\"\r\nhad got four shapely youngsters, there was general rejoicing. Two\r\nof the pups, who happened to be of the male sex, were allowed to\r\nlive; the females were sent out of this world long before their\r\neyes were opened to its joys and sorrows. It might be thought that,\r\nseeing we had nearly a hundred grown-up dogs on board, there would\r\nbe little opportunity for looking after puppies; that this was done,\r\nnevertheless, with all the care that could be wished, is due in the\r\nfirst instance to the touching affection of the second in command\r\nfor the little ones. From the very first moment he was their avowed\r\nprotector. Gradually, as the numbers increased, there was a difficulty\r\nin finding room on the already well-occupied deck. \"I'll take them\r\nin my bunk,\" said the second in command. It did not come to that,\r\nbut if it had been necessary he would certainly have done so. The\r\nexample was catching. Later on, when the little chaps were weaned,\r\nand had begun to take other nourishment, one might see regularly,\r\nafter every meal, one after another of the crew coming on deck with\r\nsome carefully scraped-up bits of food on his plate; the little hungry\r\nmouths were to have what was left over.\r\n\r\nSomething more than patience and punctual performance of duty is\r\ndisplayed in such things as those of which I have been speaking;\r\nit is love of, and a living interest in, one's work. From what I saw\r\nand heard every day, I was certain that these necessary incentives\r\nwere present; although, as far as most of the men were concerned,\r\nour object was still the protracted one of drifting for years in\r\nthe Arctic ice. The extension of the plan -- the far more imminent\r\nbattle with the ice-floes of the South -- was still undreamt of by the\r\nmajority of the ship's company. I considered it necessary to keep it\r\nto myself for a little while yet -- until our departure from the port\r\nwe were now making for: Funchal, Madeira. It may possibly appear to\r\nmany people that I was running a pretty big risk in thus putting off\r\ntill the last moment the duty of informing my comrades of the very\r\nconsiderable detour we were to make. Suppose some, or perhaps all,\r\nof them had objected! It must be admitted that it was a big risk,\r\nbut there were so many risks that had to be taken at that time.\r\n\r\nHowever, as I got to know each man during these first few weeks of our\r\nlong voyage, I soon arrived at the conviction that there was nobody\r\non board the Fram who would try to put difficulties in the way. On\r\nthe contrary, I had more and more reason to hope that they would all\r\nreceive the news with joy when they heard it; for then their whole\r\nprospect would be so different. Everything had gone with surprising\r\nease up to this time; in future it would go even better.\r\n\r\nIt was not without a certain longing that I looked forward to our\r\narrival at Madeira: it would be grand to be able to speak out! No\r\ndoubt the others who knew of the plan were equally eager. Secrets\r\nare neither amusing nor easy to carry about -- least of all on board\r\na ship, where one has to live at such close quarters as we had. We\r\nwere chatting together every day, of course, and the uninitiated\r\ncould not be deterred from leading the conversation round to the ugly\r\ndifficulties that would embitter our lives and hinder our progress\r\nwhen rounding the Horn. It was likely enough that we should manage\r\nto bring the dogs safely through the tropics once, but whether we\r\nshould succeed in doing so twice was more doubtful; and so on to\r\ninfinity. It is easier to imagine than to describe how awkward all\r\nthis was, and how cunningly one had to choose one's words to avoid\r\nsaying too much. Among inexperienced men there would have been no\r\ngreat difficulty, but it must be remembered that on the Fram pretty\r\nnearly every second man had spent years of his life in Polar voyages:\r\na single slight hint to them would have been enough to expose the\r\nwhole plan. That neither those on board nor anyone else discovered\r\nit prematurely can only be explained by its being so obvious.\r\n\r\nOur ship was a good deal too dependent on wind and weather to\r\nenable us to make any accurate estimate of the time our voyage would\r\noccupy, especially as regards those latitudes in which the winds are\r\nvariable. The estimate for the whole voyage was based on an average\r\nspeed of four knots, and at this very modest rate, as it may seem,\r\nwe ought to arrive at the lce Barrier about the middle of January,\r\n1911. As will be seen later, this was realized with remarkable\r\nexactness. For reaching Madeira we had allowed a month as a reasonable\r\ntime. We did a good deal better than this, as we were able to leave\r\nFunchal a month to the day after our departure from Christiansand. We\r\nwere always ready to forgive the estimate when it was at fault in\r\nthis way.\r\n\r\nThe delay to which we had been subjected in the English Channel\r\nwas fortunately made up along the coast of Spain and to the south\r\nof it. The north wind held until we were in the north-east trade,\r\nand then we were all right. On September 5 our observations at noon\r\ntold us that we might expect to see the lights that evening, and\r\nat 10 p.m. the light of San Lorenzo on the little island of Fora,\r\nnear Madeira, was reported from the rigging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nFrom Madeira to the Barrier\r\n\r\nOn the following morning we anchored in Funchal Roads. My brother\r\nwas to arrive at Funchal, by arrangement, early enough to be sure\r\nof preceding us there. It was, however, a good while before we saw\r\nanything of him, and we were already flattering ourselves that we had\r\narrived first when he was suddenly observed in a boat coming under our\r\nstern. We were able to tell him that all was well on board, and he\r\nbrought us a big packet of letters and newspapers that gave us news\r\nof home. A little officious gentleman, who said he was a doctor, and\r\nas such had come in an official capacity to inquire as to the state\r\nof our health, was in an amazing hurry to leave the ship again when,\r\nat the top of the gangway, he found himself confronted with a score\r\nof dogs' jaws, which at the moment were opened wide on account of the\r\nheat. The learned man's interest in our health had suddenly vanished;\r\nhis thoughts flew to the safety of his own life and limbs.\r\n\r\nAs Funchal was the last place where we could communicate with the\r\noutside world, arrangements were made for completing our supplies\r\nin every possible way, and in particular we had to take on board all\r\nthe fresh water we could. The consumption of this commodity would be\r\nvery large, and the possibility of running short had to be avoided\r\nat any price. For the time being we could do no more than fill all\r\nour tanks and every imaginable receptacle with the precious fluid,\r\nand this was done. We took about 1,000 gallons in the long-boat\r\nthat was carried just above the main hatch. This was rather a risky\r\nexperiment, which might have had awkward consequences in the event of\r\nthe vessel rolling; but we consoled ourselves with the hope of fine\r\nweather and a smooth sea during the next few weeks. During the stay at\r\nFunchal the dogs had two good meals of fresh meat as a very welcome\r\nvariety in their diet; a fair-sized carcass of a horse disappeared\r\nwith impressive rapidity at each of these banquets. For our own\r\nuse we naturally took a plentiful supply of vegetables and fruits,\r\nwhich were here to be had in abundance; it was the last opportunity\r\nwe should have of regaling ourselves with such luxuries.\r\n\r\nOur stay at Funchal was somewhat longer than was intended at first,\r\nas the engineers found it necessary to take up the propeller and\r\nexamine the brasses. This work would occupy two days, and while the\r\nthree mechanics were toiling in the heat, the rest of the ship's\r\ncompany took the opportunity of becoming acquainted with the town\r\nand its surroundings; the crew had a day's leave, half at a time. An\r\nexcursion was arranged to one of the numerous hotels that are situated\r\non the heights about the town. The ascent is easily made by means of\r\na funicular railway, and in the course of the half-hour it takes to\r\nreach the top one is able to get an idea of the luxuriant fertility of\r\nthe island. At the hotels one finds a good cuisine, and, of course,\r\nstill better wine. It is scarcely necessary to add that we did full\r\njustice to both.\r\n\r\nFor the descent a more primitive means of transport was employed:\r\nwe came down on sledges. It may be startling to hear of sledging in\r\nMadeira, but I must explain that the sledges had wooden runners, and\r\nthat the road was paved with a black stone that was very smooth. We\r\nwent at a creditable pace down the steep inclines, each sledge being\r\ndrawn or pushed by three or four swarthy natives, who seemed to be\r\npossessed of first-rate legs and lungs.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned as a curiosity that the newspapers of Funchal did\r\nnot hesitate to connect our expedition with the South Pole. The native\r\njournalists had no idea of the value of the startling piece of news\r\nthey were circulating. It was a canard invented on the supposition\r\nthat when a Polar ship steers to the south, she must, of course,\r\nbe making for the South Pole. In this case the canard happened to be\r\ntrue. Fortunately for us, it did not fly beyond the shores of Madeira.\r\n\r\nBy the afternoon of September 9 we could begin to make our preparations\r\nfor departure. The engineers had replaced the propeller and tested it;\r\nall supplies were on board, and the chronometers had been checked. All\r\nthat remained was to get rid of the importunate bumboat -- men who\r\nswarmed round the vessel in their little craft, each looking like\r\na small floating shop. These obtrusive fellows were quickly sent\r\noff down the gangway: besides ourselves only my brother was left\r\non board. Now that we were thus completely isolated from the outer\r\nworld, the long-expected moment had arrived when I could proceed to\r\ninform all my comrades of my decision, now a year old, to make for\r\nthe South. I believe all who were on board will long remember that\r\nsultry afternoon in Funchal Roads. All hands were called on deck:\r\nwhat they thought of I do not know, but it was hardly Antarctica and\r\nthe South Pole. Lieutenant Nilsen carried a big rolled-up chart; I\r\ncould see that this chart was the object of many interrogative glances.\r\n\r\nNot many words were needed before everyone could see where the\r\nwind lay, and what course we should steer henceforward. The second\r\nin command unrolled his big chart of the southern hemisphere, and\r\nI briefly explained the extended plan, as well as my reasons for\r\nkeeping it secret until this time. Now and again I had to glance at\r\ntheir faces. At first, as might be expected, they showed the most\r\nunmistakable signs of surprise; but this expression swiftly changed,\r\nand before I had finished they were all bright with smiles. I was\r\nnow sure of the answer I should get when I finally asked each man\r\nwhether he was willing to go on, and as the names were called,\r\nevery single man had his \"Yes\" ready. Although, as I have said,\r\nI had expected it to turn out as it did, it is difficult to express\r\nthe joy I felt at seeing how promptly my comrades placed themselves\r\nat my service on this momentous occasion. It appeared, however, that\r\nI was not the only one who was pleased. There was so much life and\r\ngood spirits on board that evening that one would have thought the\r\nwork was successfully accomplished instead of being hardly begun.\r\n\r\nFor the present, however, there was not much time to spare\r\nfor discussing the news. We had first to see about getting away;\r\nafterwards there would be many months before us. Two hours' grace was\r\nallowed, in which every man could write to his people at home about\r\nwhat had just passed. The letters were probably not very long ones;\r\nat all events, they were soon finished. The mail was handed over to\r\nmy brother to take to Christiania, from whence the letters were sent\r\nto their respective destinations; but this did not take place until\r\nafter the alteration of our plans had been published in the Press.\r\n\r\nIt had been easy enough to tell my comrades the news, and they could\r\nnot have given it a better reception; it was another question what\r\npeople at home would say when the intelligence reached their ears. We\r\nafterwards heard that both favourable and unfavourable opinions were\r\nexpressed. For the moment we could not trouble ourselves very greatly\r\nwith that side of the matter; my brother had undertaken to announce the\r\nway we had taken, and I cannot say that I envied him the task. After\r\nwe had all given him a final hearty shake of the hand he left us, and\r\nthereby our communication with the busy world was broken off. We were\r\nleft to our own resources. No one can say that the situation oppressed\r\nus greatly. Our long voyage was entered upon as though it were a dance;\r\nthere was not a trace of the more or less melancholy feeling that\r\nusually accompanies any parting. The men joked and laughed, while\r\nwitticisms, both good and bad, were bandied about on the subject of\r\nour original situation. The anchor came up more quickly than usual,\r\nand after the motor had helped us to escape from the oppressive heat\r\nof the harbour, we had the satisfaction of seeing every sail filled\r\nwith the fresh and cooling north-east trade.\r\n\r\nThe dogs, who must have found the stay at Funchal rather too warm for\r\ntheir taste, expressed their delight at the welcome breeze by getting\r\nup a concert. We felt we could not grudge them the pleasure this time.\r\n\r\nIt was pure enjoyment to come on deck the morning after leaving\r\nMadeira; there was an added note of friendliness in every man's\r\n\"Good-morning,\" and a smile twinkled in the corner of every eye. The\r\nentirely new turn things had taken, and the sudden change to fresh\r\nfields for thought and imagination, acted as a beneficent stimulus\r\nto those who, the day before, had contemplated a trip round the\r\nHorn. I think what chiefly amused them was their failure to smell a\r\nrat before. \"How could I have been such an ass as not to think of it\r\nlong ago?\" said Beck, as he sent a nearly new quid into the sea. \"Of\r\ncourse, it was as plain as a pikestaff. Here we are with all these\r\ndogs, this fine 'observation house,' with its big kitchen-range and\r\nshiny cloth on the table, and everything else. Any fool might have\r\nseen what it meant.\" I consoled him with the remark that it is always\r\neasy to be wise after the event, and that I thought it very lucky no\r\none had discovered our destination prematurely.\r\n\r\nThose of us who had been obliged hitherto to keep to themselves what\r\nthey knew, and to resort to all kinds of stratagems to avoid making\r\nany disclosure, were certainly no less pleased at being rid of the\r\nsecret; now they could talk freely to their heart's content. If we\r\nhad previously had to resort to mystification, there was now nothing\r\nto prevent our laying our cards on the table. So many a conversation\r\nhad come to a standstill because those who had a number of questions\r\nto ask did not dare to put them, and those who could have told held\r\ntheir tongues. Hereafter it would be a very long time before we were\r\nat a loss for subjects of conversation; a theme had suddenly presented\r\nitself, so varied and comprehensive that it was difficult at first\r\nto know where to begin. There were many men on board the Fram with\r\na wealth of experience gained during years spent within the Arctic\r\nCircle, but to almost all of us the great Antarctic continent was\r\na terra incognita. I myself was the only man on board who had seen\r\nAntarctica; perhaps one or two of my companions had in former days\r\npassed in the vicinity of an Antarctic iceberg on a voyage round Cape\r\nHorn, but that was all.\r\n\r\nWhat had previously been accomplished in the way of exploration in the\r\nSouth, and the narratives of the men who had endeavoured to extend\r\nour knowledge of that inhospitable continent, were also things that\r\nvery few of the ship's company had had time or opportunity to study,\r\nnor had they perhaps had any reason to do so. Now there was every\r\npossible reason. I considered it an imperative necessity that every man\r\nshould acquaint himself as far as possible with the work of previous\r\nexpeditions; this was the only way of becoming in some measure familiar\r\nwith the conditions in which we should have to work. For this reason\r\nthe Fram carried a whole library of Antarctic literature, containing\r\neverything that has been written by the long succession of explorers\r\nin these regions, from James Cook and James Clark Ross to Captain\r\nScott and Sir Ernest Shackleton. And, indeed, good use was made of\r\nthis library. The works of the two last-named explorers were in chief\r\nrequest; they were read from cover to cover by all who could do so,\r\nand, well written and excellently illustrated as these narratives are,\r\nthey were highly instructive. But if ample time was thus devoted to the\r\ntheoretical study of our problem, the practical preparations were not\r\nneglected. As soon as we were in the trade-winds, where the virtually\r\nconstant direction and force of the wind permitted a reduction of\r\nthe watch on deck, the various specialists went to work to put our\r\nextensive wintering outfit in the best possible order. It is true that\r\nevery precaution had been taken beforehand to have every part of the\r\nequipment as good and as well adapted to its purpose as possible, but\r\nthe whole of it, nevertheless, required a thorough overhauling. With\r\nso complicated an outfit as ours was, one is never really at the end\r\nof one's work; it will always be found that some improvement or other\r\ncan be made. It will appear later that we had our hands more than\r\nfull of the preparations for the sledge journey, not only during the\r\nlong sea voyage, but also during the still longer Antarctic winter.\r\n\r\nOur sailmaker, Ronne, was transformed into a -- well, let us call it\r\ntailor. Ronne's pride was a sewing-machine, which he had obtained from\r\nthe yard at Horten after considerable use of his persuasive tongue. His\r\ngreatest sorrow on the voyage was that, on arriving at the Barrier, he\r\nwould be obliged to hand over his treasure to the shore party. He could\r\nnot understand what we wanted with a sewing-machine at Framheim. The\r\nfirst thing he did when the Fram reached Buenos Aires was to explain\r\nto the local representative of the Singer Sewing Machine Company how\r\nabsolutely necessary it was to have his loss made good. His gift of\r\npersuasion helped him again, and he got a new machine.\r\n\r\nFor that matter, it was not surprising that Ronne was fond of his\r\nmachine. He could use it for all sorts of things -- sailmaker's,\r\nshoemaker's, saddler's, and tailor's work was all turned out with\r\nequal celerity. He established his workshop in the chart-house,\r\nand there the machine hummed incessantly through the tropics, the\r\nwest wind belt, and the ice-floes too; for, quick as our sailmaker\r\nwas with his fingers, the orders poured in even more quickly. Ronne\r\nwas one of those men whose ambition it is to get as much work as\r\npossible done in the shortest possible time, and with increasing\r\nastonishment he saw that here he would never be finished; he might\r\ngo at it as hard as he liked -- there was always something more. To\r\nreckon up all that he delivered from his workshop during these months\r\nwould take us too long; it is enough to say that all the work was\r\nremarkably well done, and executed with admirable rapidity. Perhaps\r\none of the things he personally prided himself most on having made\r\nwas the little three-man tent which was afterwards left at the South\r\nPole. It was a little masterpiece of a tent, made of thin silk, which,\r\nwhen folded together, would easily have gone into a fair-sized pocket,\r\nand weighed hardly a kilogram.\r\n\r\nAt this time we could not count with certainty on the possibility of\r\nall those who made the southern journey reaching latitude 90deg.. On\r\nthe contrary, we had to be prepared for the probability of some\r\nof the party being obliged to turn back. It was intended that we\r\nshould use the tent in question, in case it might be decided to let\r\ntwo or three men make the final dash, and therefore it was made as\r\nsmall and light as possible. Fortunately we had no need to use it,\r\nas every man reached the goal; and we then found that the best way\r\nof disposing of Ronne's work of art was to let it stay there as a mark.\r\n\r\nOur sailmaker had no dogs of his own to look after; he had no time\r\nfor that. On the other hand, he often assisted me in attending to\r\nmy fourteen friends up on the bridge; but he seemed to have some\r\ndifficulty in getting on terms of familiarity with the dogs and all\r\nthat belonged to them. It did not quite agree with his idea of life\r\non board ship to have a deck swarming with dogs. He regarded this\r\nabnormal state of things with a sort of scornful compassion. \"So you\r\ncarry dogs, too, aboard this ship,\" he would say, every time he came on\r\ndeck and found himself face to face with the \"brutes.\" The poor brutes,\r\nI am sure, made no attempt to attack Ronne's person more than anyone\r\nelse's, but he seemed for a long time to have great doubts about it. I\r\ndon't think he felt perfectly safe until the dogs had been muzzled.\r\n\r\nA part of our equipment to which we gave special care was, of course,\r\nthe ski; in all probability they would be our chief weapon in the\r\ncoming fight. However much we might have to learn from Scott's and\r\nShackleton's narratives, it was difficult for us to understand their\r\nstatements that the use of ski on the Barrier was not a success. From\r\nthe descriptions that were given of the nature of the surface and\r\nthe general conditions, we were forced to the opposite conclusion,\r\nthat ski were the only means to employ. Nothing was spared to provide\r\na good skiing outfit, and we had an experienced man in charge of it --\r\nOlav Bjaaland. It is sufficient to mention his name. When, on leaving\r\nNorway, it was a question of finding a good place for our twenty pairs\r\nof ski, we found we should have to share our own quarters with them;\r\nthey were all disposed under the ceiling of the fore-cabin. At any\r\nrate, we had no better place to put them. Bjaaland, who during the\r\nlast month or two had tried his hand at the unaccustomed work of a\r\nseaman, went back to his old trade of ski-maker and carpenter when\r\nwe came into the trade-winds. Both ski and bindings were delivered\r\nready for use by Hagen and Co., of Christiania; it remained to adapt\r\nthem, and fit the backstraps to each man's boots, so that all might\r\nbe ready for use on arrival at the Barrier. A full skiing outfit had\r\nbeen provided for every man, so that those who were to be left on board\r\nmight also have a run now and then during their stay at the ice edge.\r\n\r\nFor each of our ten sledges, Bjaaland made during the voyage a pair\r\nof loose runners, which it was intended to use in the same way as the\r\nEskimo use theirs. These primitive people have -- or, at all events,\r\nhad -- no material that was suited for shoeing sledge-runners. They\r\nget over the difficulty by covering the runners with a coating of\r\nice. No doubt it requires a great deal of practice and patience to put\r\non this kind of shoeing properly, but when it is once on there can be\r\nno question that this device throws all others into the shade. As I\r\nsay, we had intended to try this on the Barrier; we found, however,\r\nthat the pulling power of our teams was so good as to allow us to\r\nretain our steel-shod runners with an easy conscience.\r\n\r\nFor the first fourteen days after leaving Madeira the north-east trade\r\nwas fresh enough to enable us to keep up our average rate, or a little\r\nmore, with the help of the sails alone. The engine was therefore\r\nallowed a rest, and the engineers had an opportunity of cleaning\r\nand polishing it; this they did early and late, till it seemed as if\r\nthey could never get it bright enough. Nodtvedt now had a chance of\r\ndevoting himself to the occupation which is his delight in this world\r\n-- that of the blacksmith; and, indeed, there was opportunity enough\r\nfor his use of the hammer and anvil. If Ronne had plenty of sewing,\r\nNodtvedt had no less forging -- sledge-fittings, knives, pickaxes,\r\nbars and bolts, patent hooks by the hundred for dogs, chains, and so\r\non to infinity. The clang and sparks of the anvil were going all day\r\nlong till we were well into the Indian Ocean. And in the westerly\r\nbelt the blacksmith's lot was not an enviable one; it is not always\r\neasy to hit the nail on the head when one's feet rest on so unstable\r\na foundation as the Fram's deck, nor is it altogether pleasant when\r\nthe forge is filled with water several times a day.\r\n\r\nWhile we were fitting out for the voyage, the cry was constantly\r\nraised in certain quarters at home that the old Fram's hull was in a\r\nshocking state. It was said to be in bad repair, to leak like a sieve\r\n-- in fact, to be altogether rotten. It throws a curious light on these\r\nreports when we look at the voyages that the Fram has accomplished in\r\nthe last two years. For twenty months out of twenty-four she has kept\r\ngoing in open sea, and that, too, in waters which make very serious\r\ndemands on a vessel's strength. She is just as good as when she sailed,\r\nand could easily do it all over again without any repairs. We who were\r\non board all knew perfectly well before we sailed how groundless and\r\nfoolish these cries about her \"rottenness\" were; we knew, too, that\r\nthere is scarcely a wooden ship afloat on which it is not necessary\r\nto use the pumps now and then. When the engine was stopped, we found\r\nit was sufficient to take a ten minutes' turn at the hand-pump every\r\nmorning; that was all the \"leaking\" amounted to. Oh no! there was\r\nnothing wrong with the Fram's hull. On the other hand, there might be\r\na word or two to say about the rigging; if this was not all it should\r\nhave been, the fault lay entirely with the plaguy considerations of our\r\nbudget. On the foremast we had two squaresails; there ought to have\r\nbeen four. On the jib-boom there were two staysails; there was room\r\nenough for three, but the money would not run to it. In the Trades\r\nwe tried to make up for the deficiency by rigging a studding-sail\r\nalongside the foresail and a sky-sail above the topsail. I will not\r\nassert that these improvised sails contributed to improve the vessel's\r\nappearance, but they got her along, and that is a great deal more\r\nimportant. We made very fair progress southward during these September\r\ndays, and before the month was half over we had come a good way into\r\nthe tropical belt. No particularly tropical heat was felt, at any\r\nrate by us men; and as a rule the heat is not severely felt on board\r\nship in open sea so long as the vessel is moving. On a sailing-ship,\r\nlying becalmed with the sun in the zenith, it might be warmer than\r\none would wish; but in case of calms we had the engine to help us, so\r\nthat there was always a little breeze -- that is, on deck. Down below\r\nit was worse; sometimes \"hoggishly mild,\" as Beck used to put it. Our\r\notherwise comfortable cabins had one fault; there were no portholes\r\nin the ship's side, and therefore we could not get a draught; but\r\nmost of us managed without shifting our quarters. Of the two saloons,\r\nthe fore-saloon was decidedly preferable in warm weather; in a cold\r\nclimate probably the reverse would be the case. We were able to\r\nsecure a thorough draught of air forward through the alleyway leading\r\nto the forecastle; it was difficult to get a good circulation aft,\r\nwhere they also had the warm proximity of the engine. The engineers,\r\nof course, had the hottest place, but the ever-inventive Sundbeck\r\ndevised a means of improving the ventilation of the engine-room,\r\nso that even there they were not so badly off under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nOne often hears it asked, Which is to be preferred, severe heat or\r\nsevere cold? It is not easy to give a definite answer; neither of\r\nthe two is pleasant, and it must remain a matter of taste which is\r\nleast so. On board ship no doubt most people will vote for heat, as,\r\neven if the days are rather distressing, one has the glorious nights\r\nto make up for them. A bitterly cold day is poorly compensated for\r\nby an even colder night.\r\n\r\nOne decided advantage of a warm climate for men who have to be\r\nfrequently in and out of their clothes and their bunks is the\r\nsimplicity of costume which it allows. When you wear hardly anything\r\nit takes a very short time to dress.\r\n\r\nIf we had been able to take the opinion of our dogs on their existence\r\nin the tropics, they would probably have answered as one dog: \"Thanks,\r\nlet us get back to rather cooler surroundings.\" Their coats were not\r\nexactly calculated for a temperature of 90deg. in the shade, and the\r\nworst of it was that they could not change them. It is, by the way,\r\na misunderstanding to suppose that these animals absolutely must have\r\nhard frost to be comfortable; on the contrary, they prefer to be nice\r\nand warm. Here in the tropics of course they had rather too much of\r\na good thing, but they did not suffer from the heat. By stretching\r\nawnings over the whole ship we contrived that they should all be\r\nconstantly in the shade, and so long as they were not directly exposed\r\nto the sun's rays, there was no fear of anything going wrong. How\r\nwell they came through it appears best from the fact that not one of\r\nthem was on the sick-list on account of the heat. During the whole\r\nvoyage only two deaths occurred from sickness -- one was the case of\r\na bitch that died after giving birth to eight pups -- which might\r\njust as easily have caused her death under other conditions. What\r\nwas the cause of death in the other case we were unable to find out;\r\nat any rate, it was not an infectious disease.\r\n\r\nOne of our greatest fears was the possibility of an epidemic among\r\nthe dogs, but thanks to the care with which they had been picked,\r\nthere was never a sign of anything of the sort.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of the Equator, between the north-east and\r\nthe south-east trades, lies what is called the \"belt of calms.\" The\r\nposition and extent of this belt vary somewhat with the season. If\r\nyou are extremely lucky, it may happen that one trade-wind will\r\npractically take you over into the other; but, as a rule, this region\r\nwill cause quite a serious delay to sailing-ships; either there are\r\nfrequent calms, or shifting and unsteady winds. We arrived there at\r\nan unfavourable time of the year and lost the north-east trade as\r\nearly as ten degrees north of the line. If we had had the calms we\r\nlooked for, we could have got across with the help of the engine in\r\na reasonably short time, but we saw very little sign of calms. As a\r\nrule, there was an obstinate south wind blowing, and it would not have\r\ntaken very much of it to make the last few degrees of north latitude\r\nstiffer than we cared for.\r\n\r\nThe delay was annoying enough, but we had another disappointment\r\nof a more serious kind, for, curiously enough, we never had a\r\nproper shower of rain. Generally in these latitudes one encounters\r\nextremely heavy downpours, which make it possible to collect water\r\nby the barrelful in a very short space of time. We had hoped in this\r\nway to increase our store of fresh water, which was not so large\r\nbut that extreme economy had to be practised if we were to avoid\r\nrunning short. However, this hope failed us, practically speaking. We\r\nmanaged to catch a little water, but it was altogether insufficient,\r\nand the husbanding of our supply had to be enforced in future with\r\nauthority. The dogs required their daily ration, and they got it --\r\nmeasured out to a hair's-breadth. Our own consumption was limited\r\nto what was strictly necessary; soups were banished from the bill\r\nof fare, they used too much of the precious fluid; washing in fresh\r\nwater was forbidden. It must not be supposed from this that we had\r\nno opportunity of washing. We had a plentiful supply of soap, which\r\nlathered just as well in salt water as in fresh, and was thus capable\r\nof keeping ourselves and our clothes as clean as before. If for a time\r\nwe had felt a certain anxiety about our water-supply, these fears were\r\nbanished comparatively quickly, as the reserve we had taken in the\r\nlong-boat on deck lasted an incredibly long time, almost twice as long\r\nas we had dared to hope, and this saved the situation, or very nearly\r\nso. If the worst came to the worst, we should be obliged to call at one\r\nof the numerous groups of islands that would lie in our route later on.\r\n\r\nFor over six weeks the dogs had now been chained up in the places\r\nassigned to them when they came on board. In the course of that time\r\nmost of them had become so tame and tractable that we thought we\r\nmight soon let them loose. This would be a welcome change for them,\r\nand, what was more important, it would give them an opportunity for\r\nexercise. To tell the truth, we also expected some amusement from\r\nit; there would certainly be a proper shindy when all this pack got\r\nloose. But before we gave them their liberty we were obliged to\r\ndisarm them, otherwise the inevitable free fight would be liable\r\nto result in one or more of them being left on the battle-field,\r\nand we could not afford that. Every one of them was provided with a\r\nstrong muzzle; then we let them loose and waited to see what would\r\nhappen. At first nothing at all happened; it looked as if they had\r\nabandoned once for all the thought of ever moving from the spot they\r\nhad occupied so long At last a solitary individual had the bright idea\r\nof attempting a walk along the deck. But he should not have done so;\r\nit was dangerous to move about here. The unaccustomed sight of a\r\nloose dog at once aroused his nearest neighbours. A dozen of them\r\nflung themselves upon the unfortunate animal who had been the first\r\nto leave his place, rejoicing in the thought of planting their teeth\r\nin his sinful body. But to their disappointment the enjoyment was\r\nnot so great as they expected. The confounded strap round their jaws\r\nmade it impossible to get hold of the skin; the utmost they could do\r\nwas to pull a few tufts of hair out of the object of their violent\r\nonslaught. This affair of outposts gave the signal for a general\r\nengagement all along the line. What an unholy row there was for the\r\nnext couple of hours! The hair flew, but skins remained intact. The\r\nmuzzles saved a good many lives that afternoon.\r\n\r\nThese fights are the chief amusement of the Eskimo dogs; they follow\r\nthe sport with genuine passion. There would be no great objection\r\nto it if they had not the peculiar habit of always combining to set\r\nupon a single dog, who is chosen as their victim for the occasion;\r\nthey all make for this one, and if they are left to themselves they\r\nwill not stop until they have made an end of the poor beast. In this\r\nway a valuable dog may be destroyed in a moment.\r\n\r\nWe therefore naturally made every effort from the first to quench their\r\nlove of fighting, and the dogs very soon began to understand that we\r\nwere not particularly fond of their combats; but we had here to deal\r\nwith a natural characteristic, which it was impossible to eradicate;\r\nin any case, one could never be sure that nature would not reassert\r\nitself over discipline. When the dogs had once been let loose, they\r\nremained free to run about wherever they liked for the remainder\r\nof the voyage; only at meal-times were they tied up. It was quite\r\nextraordinary how they managed to hide themselves in every hole and\r\ncomer; on some mornings there was hardly a dog to be seen when daylight\r\ncame. Of course they visited every place where they ought not to have\r\ngone. Several of them repeatedly took the opportunity of tumbling into\r\nthe forehold, when the hatches were open; but a fall of 25 feet did\r\nnot seem to trouble them in the least. One even found his way into\r\nthe engine-room, difficult as it might seem to gain access to it,\r\nand curled himself up between the piston-rods. Fortunately for the\r\nvisitor, the engine was not started while he was there.\r\n\r\nWhen the first furious battles had been fought out, a calm soon\r\nsettled upon the dogs' spirits. It was easy to notice a feeling of\r\nshame and disappointment in the champions when they found that all\r\ntheir efforts led to nothing. The sport had lost its principal charm\r\nas soon as they saw what a poor chance there was of tasting blood.\r\n\r\nFrom what has here been said, and perhaps from other accounts of the\r\nnature of Arctic dogs, it may appear as though the mutual relations\r\nof these animals consisted exclusively of fighting. This, however,\r\nis far from being the case. On the contrary, they very often form\r\nfriendships, which are sometimes so strong that one dog simply cannot\r\nlive without the other. Before we let the dogs loose we had remarked\r\nthat there were a few who, for some reason or other, did not seem as\r\nhappy as they should have been: they were more shy and restless than\r\nthe others. No particular notice was taken of this, and no one tried to\r\nfind out the cause of it. The day we let them loose we discovered what\r\nhad been the matter with the ones that had moped: they had some old\r\nfriend who had chanced to be placed in some other part of the deck,\r\nand this separation had been the cause of their low spirits. It was\r\nreally touching to see the joy they showed on meeting again; they\r\nbecame quite different animals. Of course in these cases a change of\r\nplaces was arranged between the different groups, so that those who\r\nhad associated from their own inclination would in future be members\r\nof the same team.\r\n\r\nWe had expected to reach the Equator by October 1, but the unfavourable\r\nconditions of wind that we met with to the north of it caused us to be\r\na little behind our reckoning, though not much. On the afternoon of\r\nOctober 4 the Fram crossed the line. Thus an important stage of the\r\nvoyage was concluded: the feeling that we had now reached southern\r\nlatitudes was enough to put us all in holiday humour, and we felt\r\nwe must get up a modest entertainment. According to ancient custom,\r\ncrossing the line should be celebrated by a visit from Father Neptune\r\nhimself, whose part is taken for the occasion by someone chosen\r\nfrom among the ship's company. If in the course of his inspection\r\nthis august personage comes upon anyone who is unable to prove that\r\nhe has already crossed the famous circle, he is handed over at once\r\nto the attendants, to be \"shaved and baptized.\" This process, which\r\nis not always carried out with exaggerated gentleness, causes much\r\namusement, and forms a welcome variety in the monotonous life of a\r\nlong sea voyage, and probably many on board the Fram looked forward\r\nwith eagerness to Neptune's visit, but he did not come. There simply\r\nwas no room for him on our already well-occupied deck.\r\n\r\nWe contented ourselves with a special dinner, followed by coffee,\r\nliqueurs, and cigars. Coffee was served on the fore-deck, where by\r\nmoving a number of the dogs we had contrived to get a few square yards\r\nof space. There was no lack of entertainment. A violin and mandolin\r\norchestra, composed of Prestrud, Sundbeck, and Beck, contributed\r\nseveral pieces, and our excellent gramophone was heard for the first\r\ntime. Just as it started the waltz from \"The Count of Luxembourg,\"\r\nthere appeared in the companion-way a real ballet-girl, masked, and\r\nin very short skirts. This unexpected apparition from a better world\r\nwas greeted with warm applause, which was no less vigorous when the\r\nfair one had given proof of her skill in the art of dancing. Behind\r\nthe mask could be detected Gjertsen's face, but both costume and\r\ndance were in the highest degree feminine. Ronne was not satisfied\r\nuntil he had the \"lady\" on his knees -- hurrah for illusion!\r\n\r\nThe gramophone now changed to a swinging American cake-walk, and at\r\nthe same moment there opportunely appeared on the scene a nigger in\r\na tail-coat, a silk hat, and -- a pair of wooden shoes. Black as he\r\nwas, we saw at once that it was the second in command who had thus\r\ndisguised himself. The mere sight of him was enough to set us all\r\nshrieking with laughter, but he made his great success when he began\r\nto dance. He was intensely amusing.\r\n\r\nIt did us a great deal of good to have a little amusement just then,\r\nfor this part of the voyage was a trial of patience more than anything\r\nelse. Possibly we were rather hard to please, but the south-east trade,\r\nwhich we were expecting to meet every day, was, in our opinion, far too\r\nlate in coming, and when at length it arrived, it did not behave at all\r\nas becomes a wind that has the reputation of being the steadiest in the\r\nworld. Besides being far too light, according to our requirements,\r\nit permitted itself such irregularities as swinging between the\r\npoints of south and east, but was mostly in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe former. For us, who had to lie all the time close-hauled to the\r\nwestward, this had the effect of increasing our western longitude a\r\ngreat deal faster than our latitude. We were rapidly approaching the\r\nnorth-eastern point of South America -- Cape San Roque. Fortunately\r\nwe escaped any closer contact with this headland, which shoots so far\r\nout into the Atlantic. The wind at last shifted aft, but it was so\r\nlight that the motor had to be constantly in use. Slowly but surely\r\nwe now went southward, and the temperature again began to approach\r\nthe limits that are fitting according to a Northerner's ideas. The\r\ntiresome, rather low awning could be removed, and it was a relief to\r\nbe rid of it, as one could then walk upright everywhere.\r\n\r\nOn October 16, according to the observations at noon, we were in the\r\nvicinity of the island of South Trinidad, one of the lonely oases\r\nin the watery desert of the South Atlantic. It was our intention\r\nto go close under the island, and possibly to attempt a landing;\r\nbut unfortunately the motor had to be stopped for cleaning, and\r\nthis prevented our approaching it by daylight. We caught a glimpse\r\nof the land at dusk, which was, at all events, enough to check our\r\nchronometers.\r\n\r\nSouth of the 20th degree of latitude the south-east trade was nearly\r\ndone with, and we were really not sorry to be rid of it; it remained\r\nlight and scant to the last, and sailing on a wind is not a strong\r\npoint with the Fram. In the part of the ocean where we now were there\r\nwas a hope of getting a good wind, and it was wanted if we were to\r\ncome out right: we had now covered 6,000 miles, but there were still\r\n10,000 before us, and the days went by with astonishing rapidity. The\r\nend of October brought the change we wanted; with a fresh northerly\r\nbreeze she went gallantly southward, and before the end of the month\r\nwe were down in lat. 40deg.. Here we had reached the waters where we\r\nwere almost certain to have all the wind we wished, and from the\r\nright quarter. From now our course was eastward along what is known\r\nas the southern west wind belt. This belt extends between the 40th\r\nand 50th parallels all round the earth, and is distinguished by the\r\nconstant occurrence of westerly winds, which as a rule blow with great\r\nviolence. We had put our trust in these west winds; if they failed us\r\nwe should be in a mess. But no sooner had we reached their domain than\r\nthey were upon us with full force; it was no gentle treatment that we\r\nreceived, but the effect was excellent -- we raced to the eastward. An\r\nintended call at Gough Island had to be abandoned; the sea was running\r\ntoo high for us to venture to approach the narrow little harbour. The\r\nmonth of October had put us a good deal behindhand, but now we were\r\nmaking up the distance we had lost. We had reckoned on being south of\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope within two months after leaving Madeira, and this\r\nturned out correct. The day we passed the meridian of the Cape we had\r\nthe first regular gale; the seas ran threateningly high, but now for\r\nthe first time our splendid little ship showed what she was worth. A\r\nsingle one of these gigantic waves would have cleared our decks\r\nin an instant if it had come on board, but the Fram did not permit\r\nany such impertinence. When they came up behind the vessel, and we\r\nmight expect at any moment to see them break over the low after-deck,\r\nshe just raised herself with an elegant movement, and the wave had\r\nto be content with slipping underneath. An albatross could not have\r\nmanaged the situation better. It is said that the Fram was built for\r\nthe ice, and that cannot, of course, be denied; but at the same time\r\nit is certain that when Colin Archer created his famous masterpiece\r\nof an ice boat, she was just as much a masterpiece of a sea boat --\r\na vessel it would be difficult to match for seaworthiness. To be able\r\nto avoid the seas as the Fram did, she had to roll, and this we had\r\nevery opportunity of finding out. The whole long passage through the\r\nwesterly belt was one continual rolling; but in course of time one\r\ngot used even to that discomfort. It was awkward enough, but less\r\ndisagreeable than shipping water. Perhaps it was worse for those who\r\nhad to work in the galley: it is no laughing matter to be cook, when\r\nfor weeks together you cannot put down so much as a coffee-cup without\r\nits immediately turning a somersault. It requires both patience and\r\nstrong will to carry it through, but the two -- Lindstrom and Olsen\r\n-- who looked after our food under these difficult conditions, had\r\nthe gift of taking it all from the humorous point of view, and that\r\nwas well.\r\n\r\nAs regards the dogs, it mattered little to them whether a gale was\r\nblowing, so long as the rain kept off. They hate rain; wet in any form\r\nis the worst one can offer an Arctic dog. If the deck was wet, they\r\nwould not lie down, but would remain standing motionless for hours,\r\ntrying to take a nap in that uncomfortable position. Of course, they\r\ndid not get much sleep in that way, but to make up for it they could\r\nsleep all day and all night when the weather was fine. South of the\r\nCape we lost two dogs; they went overboard one dark night when the ship\r\nwas rolling tremendously. We had a coal-bunker on the port side of the\r\nafter-deck, reaching up to the height of the bulwarks; probably these\r\nfellows had been practising boarding drill, and lost their balance. We\r\ntook precautions that the same thing should not happen again.\r\n\r\nFortunately for our animals, the weather in the westerly belt was\r\nsubject to very frequent changes. No doubt they had many a sleepless\r\nnight, with rain, sleet, and hail; but on the other hand they never had\r\nto wait very long for a cheerful glimpse of the sun. The wind is for\r\nthe most part of cyclonic character, shifting suddenly from one quarter\r\nto another, and these shifts always involve a change of weather. When\r\nthe barometer begins to fall, it is a sure warning of an approaching\r\nnorth-westerly wind, which is always accompanied by precipitation,\r\nand increases in force until the fall of the barometer ceases. When\r\nthis occurs, there follows either a short pause, or else the wind\r\nsuddenly shifts to the south-west, and blows from that quarter with\r\nincreasing violence, while the barometer rises rapidly. The change\r\nof wind is almost always followed by a clearing of the weather.\r\n\r\nA circumstance which contributes an element of risk to navigation in\r\nthe latitudes where we found ourselves is the possibility of colliding\r\nwith an iceberg in darkness or thick weather; for it sometimes happens\r\nthat these sinister monsters in the course of their wanderings find\r\ntheir way well up into the \"forties.\" The probability of a collision\r\nis of course in itself not very great, and it can be reduced to\r\na minimum by taking proper precautions. At night an attentive and\r\npractised look-out man will always be able to see the blink of the\r\nice at a fairly long distance. From the time when we had to reckon\r\nwith any likelihood of meeting icebergs, the temperature of the water\r\nwas also taken every two hours during the night.\r\n\r\nAs Kerguelen Island lay almost directly in the course we intended to\r\nfollow, it was decided for several reasons that we should call there,\r\nand pay a visit to the Norwegian whaling-station. Latterly many of\r\nthe dogs had begun to grow thin, and it seemed probable that this was\r\nowing to their not having enough fatty substances in their food; on\r\nKerguelen Island there would presumably be an opportunity of getting\r\nall the fat we wanted. As to water, we had, it was true, just enough to\r\nlast us with economy, but it would do no harm to fill up the tanks. I\r\nwas also hoping that there would be a chance of engaging three or four\r\nextra hands, for the Fram would be rather short-handed with only ten\r\nmen to sail her out of the ice and round the Horn to Buenos Aires after\r\nthe rest of us had been landed on the Barrier. Another reason for the\r\ncontemplated visit was that it would be an agreeable diversion. We now\r\nonly had to get there as quickly as possible, and the west wind helped\r\nus splendidly; one stiff breeze succeeded another, without our having\r\nany excessive weather. Our daily distance at this time amounted as a\r\nrule to about one hundred and fifty miles; in one twenty-four hours\r\nwe made one hundred and seventy-four miles. This was our best day's\r\nwork of the whole voyage, and it is no bad performance for a vessel\r\nlike the Fram, with her limited sail area and her heavily-laden hull.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of November 28 we sighted land. It was only a barren\r\nrocky knoll, and according to our determination of the position it\r\nwould be the island called Bligh's Cap, which lies a few miles north\r\nof Kerguelen Island; but as the weather was not very clear, and we\r\nwere unacquainted with the channels, we preferred to lie-to for the\r\nnight before approaching any nearer. Early next morning the weather\r\ncleared, and we got accurate bearings. A course was laid for Royal\r\nSound, where we supposed the whaling-station to be situated. We were\r\ngoing well in the fresh morning breeze, and were just about to round\r\nthe last headland, when all at once a gale sprang up again, the bare\r\nand uninviting coast was hidden in heavy rain, and we had the choice\r\nof waiting for an indefinite time or continuing our voyage. Without\r\nmuch hesitation we chose the latter alternative. It might be tempting\r\nenough to come in contact with other men, especially as they were\r\nfellow-countrymen, but it was even more tempting to have done with the\r\nremaining 4,000 miles that lay between us and the Barrier as quickly as\r\npossible. It turned out that we had chosen rightly. December brought us\r\na fair wind, even fresher than that of November, and by the middle of\r\nthe month we had already covered half the distance between Kerguelen\r\nIsland and our goal. We fortified the dogs from time to time with\r\na liberal allowance of butter, which had a marvellous effect. There\r\nwas nothing wrong with ourselves; we were all in the best of health,\r\nand our spirits rose as we drew nearer our goal.\r\n\r\nThat the state of our health was so remarkably good during the whole\r\nvoyage must be ascribed in a material degree to the excellence of\r\nour provisions. During the trip from home to Madeira we had lived\r\nsumptuously on some little pigs that we took with us, but after these\r\nluxuries we had to take to tinned meat for good. The change was not\r\nfelt much, as we had excellent and palatable things with us. There was\r\na separate service for the two cabins, but the food was precisely the\r\nsame in each. Breakfast was at eight, consisting of American hot cakes,\r\nwith marmalade or jam, cheese, fresh bread, and coffee or cocoa. Dinner\r\nas a rule was composed of one dish of meat and sweets. As has already\r\nbeen said, we could not afford to have soup regularly on account of\r\nthe water it required, and it was only served on Sundays. The second\r\ncourse usually consisted of Californian fruit. It was our aim all\r\nthrough to employ fruit, vegetables, and jam, to the greatest possible\r\nextent; there is undoubtedly no better means of avoiding sickness. At\r\ndinner we always drank syrup and water; every Wednesday and Saturday\r\nwe were treated to a glass of spirits. I knew from my own experience\r\nhow delicious a cup of coffee tastes when one turns out to go on\r\nwatch at night. However sleepy and grumpy one may be, a gulp of hot\r\ncoffee quickly makes a better man of one; therefore coffee for the\r\nnight watch was a permanent institution on board the Fram.\r\n\r\nBy about Christmas we had reached nearly the 150th meridian in\r\nlat. 56deg. S. This left not much more than 900 miles before we might\r\nexpect to meet with the pack-ice. Our glorious west wind, which had\r\ndriven us forward for weeks, and freed us from all anxiety about\r\narriving too late, was now a thing of the past. For a change we again\r\nhad to contend for some days with calms and contrary wind. The day\r\nbefore Christmas Eve brought rain and a gale from the south-west,\r\nwhich was not very cheerful. If we were to keep Christmas with any\r\nfestivity, fine weather was wanted, otherwise the everlasting rolling\r\nwould spoil all our attempts. No doubt we should all have got over\r\nit if it had fallen to our lot to experience a Christmas Eve with\r\nstorm, shortened sail, and other delights; worse things had happened\r\nbefore. On the other hand, there was not one of us who would not be\r\nthe better for a little comfort and relaxation; our life had been\r\nmonotonous and commonplace enough for a long time. But, as I said,\r\nthe day before Christmas Eve was not at all promising. The only sign\r\nof the approaching holiday was the fact that Lindstrom, in spite of\r\nthe rolling, was busy baking Christmas cakes. We suggested that he\r\nmight just as well give us each our share at once, as it is well known\r\nthat the cakes are best when they come straight out of the oven, but\r\nLindstrom would not hear of it. His cakes vanished for the time being\r\nunder lock and key, and we had to be content with the smell of them.\r\n\r\nChristmas Eve arrived with finer weather and a smoother sea than we had\r\nseen for weeks. The ship was perfectly steady, and there was nothing to\r\nprevent our making every preparation for the festivity. As the day wore\r\non Christmas was in full swing. The fore-cabin was washed and cleaned\r\nup till the Ripolin paint and the brass shone with equal brilliance;\r\nRonne decorated the workroom with signal flags, and the good old\r\n\"Happy Christmas\" greeted us in a transparency over the door of the\r\nsaloon. Inside Nilsen was busily engaged, showing great talents as a\r\ndecorator. The gramophone was rigged up in my cabin on a board hung\r\nfrom the ceiling. A proposed concert of piano, violin, and mandolin\r\nhad to be abandoned, as the piano was altogether out of tune.\r\n\r\nThe various members of our little community appeared one after\r\nanother, dressed and tidied up so that many of them were scarcely\r\nrecognizable. The stubbly chins were all smooth, and that makes a\r\ngreat difference. At five o'clock the engine was stopped, and all\r\nhands assembled in the fore-cabin, leaving only the man at the wheel\r\non deck. Our cosy cabins had a fairy-like appearance in the subdued\r\nlight of the many-coloured lamps, and we were all in the Christmas\r\nhumour at once. The decorations did honour to him who had carried\r\nthem out and to those who had given us the greater part of them --\r\nMrs. Schroer, and the proprietor of the Oyster Cellar at Christiania,\r\nMr. Ditlev-Hansen.\r\n\r\nThen we took our seats round the table, which groaned beneath\r\nLindstrom's masterpieces in the culinary art. I slipped behind\r\nthe curtain of my cabin for an instant, and set the gramophone\r\ngoing. Herold sang us \"Glade Jul.\"\r\n\r\nThe song did not fail of its effect; it was difficult to see in the\r\nsubdued light, but I fancy that among the band of hardy men that\r\nsat round the table there was scarcely one who had not a tear in\r\nthe corner of his eye. The thoughts of all took the same direction,\r\nI am certain -- they flew homeward to the old country in the North,\r\nand we could wish nothing better than that those we had left behind\r\nshould be as well off as ourselves. The melancholy feeling soon\r\ngave way to gaiety and laughter; in the course of the dinner the\r\nfirst mate fired off a topical song written by himself, which had\r\nan immense success. In each verse the little weaknesses of someone\r\npresent were exhibited in more or less strong relief, and in between\r\nthere were marginal remarks in prose. Both in text and performance\r\nthe author fully attained the object of his work -- that of thoroughly\r\nexercising our risible muscles.\r\n\r\nIn the after-cabin a well-furnished coffee-table was set out, on\r\nwhich there was a large assortment of Lindstrom's Christmas baking,\r\nwith a mighty kransekake from Hansen's towering in the midst. While\r\nwe were doing all possible honour to these luxuries, Lindstrom was\r\nbusily engaged forward, and when we went back after our coffee we\r\nfound there a beautiful Christmas-tree in all its glory. The tree was\r\nan artificial one, but so perfectly imitated that it might have come\r\nstraight from the forest. This was also a present from Mrs. Schroer.\r\n\r\nThen came the distribution of Christmas presents. Among the many\r\nkind friends who had thought of us I must mention the Ladies'\r\nCommittees in Horten and Fredrikstad, and the telephone employees\r\nof Christiania. They all have a claim to our warmest gratitude for\r\nthe share they had in making our Christmas what it was -- a bright\r\nmemory of the long voyage.\r\n\r\nBy ten o'clock in the evening the candles of the Christmas-tree were\r\nburnt out, and the festivity was at an end. It had been successful\r\nfrom first to last, and we all had something to live on in our thoughts\r\nwhen our everyday duties again claimed us.\r\n\r\nIn that part of the voyage which we now had before us -- the region\r\nbetween the Australian continent and the Antarctic belt of pack-ice --\r\nwe were prepared for all sorts of trials in the way of unfavourable\r\nweather conditions. We had read and heard so much of what others had\r\nhad to face in these waters that we involuntarily connected them with\r\nall the horrors that may befall a sailor. Not that we had a moment's\r\nfear for the ship; we knew her well enough to be sure that it would\r\ntake some very extraordinary weather to do her any harm. If we were\r\nafraid of anything, it was of delay.\r\n\r\nBut we were spared either delay or any other trouble; by noon on\r\nChristmas Day we had just what was wanted to keep our spirits at\r\nfestival pitch; a fresh north-westerly wind, just strong enough to\r\npush us along handsomely toward our destination. It afterwards hauled\r\na little more to the west, and lasted the greater part of Christmas\r\nweek, until on December 30 we were in long. 170deg. E. and lat. 60deg.\r\nS. With that we had at last come far enough to the east, and could now\r\nbegin to steer a southerly course; hardly had we put the helm over\r\nbefore the wind changed to a stiff northerly breeze Nothing could\r\npossibly be better; in this way it would not take us long to dispose\r\nof the remaining degrees of latitude. Our faithful companions of the\r\nwesterly belt -- the albatrosses -- had now disappeared, and we could\r\nsoon begin to look out for the first representatives of the winged\r\ninhabitants of Antarctica.\r\n\r\nAfter a careful consideration of the experiences of our predecessors,\r\nit was decided to lay our course so that we should cross the 65th\r\nparallel in long. 175deg. E. What we had to do was to get as quickly\r\nas possible through the belt of pack-ice that blocked the way to\r\nRoss Sea to the south of it, which is always open in summer. Some\r\nships had been detained as much as six weeks in this belt of ice;\r\nothers had gone through in a few hours. We unhesitatingly preferred\r\nto follow the latter example, and therefore took the course that the\r\nluckier ones had indicated.\r\n\r\nOf course, the width of the ice-belt may be subject to somewhat\r\nfortuitous changes, but it seems, nevertheless, that as a rule the\r\nregion between the 175th and the 180th degrees of longitude offers the\r\nbest chance of getting through rapidly; in any case, one ought not to\r\nenter the ice farther to the west. At noon on New Year's Eve we were\r\nin lat. 62deg. 15' S. We had reached the end of the old year, and really\r\nit had gone incredibly quickly. Like all its predecessors, the year\r\nhad brought its share of success and failure; but the main thing was\r\nthat at its close we found ourselves pretty nearly where we ought to\r\nbe to make good our calculations -- and all safe and well. Conscious of\r\nthis, we said good-bye to 1910 in all friendliness over a good glass of\r\ntoddy in the evening, and wished each other all possible luck in 1911.\r\n\r\nAt three in the morning of New Year's Day the officer of the watch\r\ncalled me with news that the first iceberg was in sight. I had to go up\r\nand see it. Yes, there it lay, far to windward, shining like a castle\r\nin the rays of the morning sun. It was a big, flat-topped berg of the\r\ntypical Antarctic form. It will perhaps seem paradoxical when I say\r\nthat we all greeted this first sight of the ice with satisfaction and\r\njoy; an iceberg is usually the last thing to gladden sailors' hearts,\r\nbut we were not looking at the risk just then. The meeting with the\r\nimposing colossus had another significance that had a stronger claim\r\non our interest -- the pack-ice could not be far off. We were all\r\nlonging as one man to be in it; it would be a grand variation in the\r\nmonotonous life we had led for so long, and which we were beginning\r\nto be a little tired of. Merely to be able to run a few yards on an\r\nice-floe appeared to us an event of importance, and we rejoiced no\r\nless at the prospect of giving our dogs a good meal of seal's flesh,\r\nwhile we ourselves would have no objection to a little change of diet.\r\n\r\nThe number of icebergs increased during the afternoon and night,\r\nand with such neighbours it suited us very well to have daylight all\r\nthrough the twenty-four hours, as we now had. The weather could not\r\nhave been better -- fine and clear, with a light but still favourable\r\nwind. At 8 p.m. on January 2 the Antarctic Circle was crossed,\r\nand an hour or two later the crow's-nest was able to report the\r\nice-belt ahead. For the time being it did not look like obstructing\r\nus to any great extent; the floes were collected in long lines, with\r\nbroad channels of open water between them. We steered right in. Our\r\nposition was then long. 176deg. E. and lat. 66deg. 30' S. The ice immediately\r\nstopped all swell, the vessel's deck again became a stable platform,\r\nand after two months' incessant exercise of our sea-legs we could\r\nonce more move about freely. That was a treat in itself.\r\n\r\nAt nine in the morning of the next day we had our first opportunity of\r\nseal-hunting; a big Weddell seal was observed on a floe right ahead. It\r\ntook our approach with the utmost calmness, not thinking it worth while\r\nto budge an inch until a couple of rifle-bullets had convinced it of\r\nthe seriousness of the situation. It then made an attempt to reach\r\nthe water, but it was too late. Two men were already on the floe,\r\nand the valuable spoil was secured. In the course of a quarter of an\r\nhour the beast lay on our deck, flayed and cut up by practised hands;\r\nthis gave us at one stroke at least four hundredweight of dog food,\r\nas well as a good many rations for men. We made the same coup three\r\ntimes more in the course of the day, and thus had over a ton of fresh\r\nmeat and blubber.\r\n\r\nIt need scarcely be said that there was a great feast on board that\r\nday. The dogs did their utmost to avail themselves of the opportunity;\r\nthey simply ate till their legs would no longer carry them, and we\r\ncould grant them this gratification with a good conscience. As to\r\nourselves, it may doubtless be taken for granted that we observed some\r\ndegree of moderation, but dinner was polished off very quickly. Seal\r\nsteak had many ardent adherents already, and it very soon gained\r\nmore. Seal soup, in which our excellent vegetables showed to advantage,\r\nwas perhaps even more favourably received.\r\n\r\nFor the first twenty-four hours after we entered the ice it was so\r\nloose that we were able to hold our course and keep up our speed for\r\npractically the whole time. On the two following days things did\r\nnot go quite so smoothly; at times the lines of floes were fairly\r\nclose, and occasionally we had to go round. We did not meet with any\r\nconsiderable obstruction, however; there were always openings enough\r\nto enable us to keep going. In the course of January 6 a change took\r\nplace, the floes became narrower and the leads broader. By 6 p.m. there\r\nwas open sea on every side as far as the eye could reach. The day's\r\nobservations gave our position as lat. 70deg. S., long. 180deg. E.\r\n\r\nOur passage through the pack had been a four days' pleasure trip,\r\nand I have a suspicion that several among us looked back with secret\r\nregret to the cruise in smooth water through the ice-floes when the\r\nswell of the open Ross Sea gave the Fram another chance of showing\r\nher rolling capabilities.\r\n\r\nBut this last part of the voyage was also to be favoured by\r\nfortune. These comparatively little-known waters had no terrors to\r\noppose to us. The weather continued surprisingly fine; it could not\r\nhave been better on a summer trip in the North Sea. Of icebergs there\r\nwas practically none; a few quite small floebergs were all we met\r\nwith in the four days we took to cross Ross Sea.\r\n\r\nAbout midday on January 11 a marked brightening of the southern sky\r\nannounced that it was not far to the goal we had been struggling to\r\nreach for five months. At 2.30 p.m. we came in sight of the Great\r\nIce Barrier. Slowly it rose up out of the sea until we were face\r\nto face with it in all its imposing majesty. It is difficult with\r\nthe help of the pen to give any idea of the impression this mighty\r\nwall of ice makes on the observer who is confronted with it for the\r\nfirst time. It is altogether a thing which can hardly be described;\r\nbut one can understand very well that this wall of 100 feet in height\r\nwas regarded for a generation as an insuperable obstacle to further\r\nsouthward progress.\r\n\r\nWe knew that the theory of the Barrier's impregnability had long ago\r\nbeen overthrown; there was an opening to the unknown realm beyond\r\nit. This opening -- the Bay of Whales -- ought to lie, according\r\nto the descriptions before us, about a hundred miles to the east of\r\nthe position in which we were. Our course was altered to true east,\r\nand during a cruise of twenty-four hours along the Barrier we had\r\nevery opportunity of marvelling at this gigantic work of Nature. It\r\nwas not without a certain feeling of suspense that we looked forward\r\nto our arrival at the harbour we were seeking What state should we\r\nfind it in? Would it prove impossible to land at all conveniently?\r\n\r\nOne point after another was passed, but still our anxious eyes were\r\nmet by nothing but the perpendicular wall. At last, on the afternoon\r\nof January 12, the wall opened. This agreed with our expectations;\r\nwe were now in long. 164deg., the selfsame point where our predecessors\r\nhad previously found access.\r\n\r\nWe had before us a great bay, so deep that it was impossible to see\r\nthe end of it from the crow's-nest; but for the moment there was no\r\nchance of getting in. The bay was full of great floes -- sea-ice --\r\nrecently broken up. We therefore went on a little farther to the\r\neastward to await developments. Next morning we returned, and after\r\nthe lapse of a few hours the floes within the bay began to move. One\r\nafter another they came sailing out: the passage was soon free.\r\n\r\nAs we steered up the bay, we soon saw clearly that here we had every\r\nchance of effecting a landing. All we had to do was to choose the\r\nbest place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nOn the Barrier\r\n\r\nWe had thus arrived on January 14 -- a day earlier than we had reckoned\r\n-- at this vast, mysterious, natural phenomenon -- the Barrier. One\r\nof the most difficult problems of the expedition was solved -- that\r\nof conveying our draught animals in sound condition to the field\r\nof operations. We had taken 97 dogs on board at Christiansand; the\r\nnumber had now increased to 116, and practically all of these would\r\nbe fit to serve in the final march to the South.\r\n\r\nThe next great problem that confronted us was to find a suitable place\r\non the Barrier for our station. My idea had been to get everything --\r\nequipment and provisions -- conveyed far enough into the Barrier to\r\nsecure us against the unpleasant possibility of drifting out into\r\nthe Pacific in case the Barrier should be inclined to calve. I had\r\ntherefore fixed upon ten miles as a suitable distance from the edge\r\nof the Barrier. But even our first impression of the conditions\r\nseemed to show that we should be spared a great part of this long\r\nand troublesome transport. Along its outer edge the Barrier shows an\r\neven, flat surface; but here, inside the bay, the conditions were\r\nentirely different. Even from the deck of the Fram we were able to\r\nobserve great disturbances of the surface in every direction; huge\r\nridges with hollows between them extended on all sides. The greatest\r\nelevation lay to the south in the form of a lofty, arched ridge, which\r\nwe took to be about 500 feet high on the horizon. But it might be\r\nassumed that this ridge continued to rise beyond the range of vision.\r\n\r\nOur original hypothesis that this bay was due to underlying land\r\nseemed, therefore, to be immediately confirmed. It did not take long\r\nto moor the vessel to the fixed ice-foot, which here extended for\r\nabout a mile and a quarter beyond the edge of the Barrier. Everything\r\nhad been got ready long before. Bjaaland had put our ski in order,\r\nand every man had had his right pairs fitted. Ski-boots had long ago\r\nbeen tried on, time after time, sometimes with one, sometimes with two\r\npairs of stockings. Of course it turned out that the ski-boots were on\r\nthe small side. To get a bootmaker to make roomy boots is, I believe,\r\nan absolute impossibility. However, with two pairs of stockings we\r\ncould always get along in the neighbourhood of the ship. For longer\r\njourneys we had canvas boots, as already mentioned.\r\n\r\nOf the remainder of our outfit I need only mention the Alpine ropes,\r\nwhich had also been ready for some time. They were about 30 yards long,\r\nand were made of very fine rope, soft as silk, specially suited for\r\nuse in low temperatures.\r\n\r\nAfter a hurried dinner four of us set out. This first excursion\r\nwas quite a solemn affair; so much depended on it. The weather was\r\nof the very best, calm with brilliant sunshine, and a few light,\r\nfeathery clouds in the beautiful, pale blue sky. There was warmth in\r\nthe air which could be felt, even on this immense ice-field. Seals\r\nwere lying along the ice-foot as far as the eye could reach -- great,\r\nfat mountains of flesh; food enough to last us and the dogs for years.\r\n\r\nThe going was ideal; our ski glided easily and pleasantly through the\r\nnewly fallen loose snow. But none of us was exactly in training after\r\nthe long five months' sea voyage, so that the pace was not great. After\r\nhalf an hour's march we were already at the first important point --\r\nthe connection between the sea-ice and the Barrier. This connection had\r\nalways haunted our brains. What would it be like? A high, perpendicular\r\nface of ice, up which we should have to haul our things laboriously\r\nwith the help of tackles? Or a great and dangerous fissure, which\r\nwe should not be able to cross without going a long way round? We\r\nnaturally expected something of the sort. This mighty and terrible\r\nmonster would, of course, offer resistance in some form or other.\r\n\r\nThe mystic Barrier! All accounts without exception, from the days\r\nof Ross to the present time, had spoken of this remarkable natural\r\nformation with apprehensive awe. It was as though one could always\r\nread between the lines the same sentence: \"Hush, be quiet! the mystic\r\nBarrier !\"\r\n\r\nOne, two, three, and a little jump, and the Barrier was surmounted!\r\n\r\nWe looked at each other and smiled; probably the same thought was in\r\nthe minds of all of us. The monster had begun to lose something of\r\nits mystery, the terror something of its force; the incomprehensible\r\nwas becoming quite easy to understand.\r\n\r\nWithout striking a blow we had entered into our kingdom. The Barrier\r\nwas at this spot about 20 feet high, and the junction between it\r\nand the sea-ice was completely filled up with driven snow, so that\r\nthe ascent took the form of a little, gentle slope. This spot would\r\ncertainly offer us no resistance.\r\n\r\nHitherto we had made our advance without a rope. The sea-ice, we knew,\r\nwould offer no hidden difficulties; but what would be the condition\r\nof things beyond the Barrier was another question. And as we all\r\nthought it would be better to have the rope on before we fell into\r\na crevasse than afterwards, our further advance was made with a rope\r\nbetween the first two.\r\n\r\nWe proceeded in an easterly direction up through a little valley formed\r\nby \"Mount Nelson\" on one side, and \"Mount Ronniken\" on the other. The\r\nreader must not, however, imagine from these imposing names that we\r\nwere walking between any formidable mountain-ranges. Mounts Nelson\r\nand Ronniken were nothing but two old pressure ridges that had been\r\nformed in those far-off days when the mighty mass of ice had pushed\r\non with awful force without meeting hindrance or resistance, until\r\nat this spot it met a superior power that clove and splintered it,\r\nand set a bound to its further advance. It must have been a frightful\r\ncollision, like the end of a world. But now it was over: peace -- an\r\nair of infinite peace lay over it all. Nelson and Ronniken were only\r\ntwo pensioned veterans. Regarded as pressure ridges they were huge,\r\nraising their highest summits over 100 feet in the air. Here in the\r\nvalley the surface round Nelson was quite filled up, while Ronniken\r\nstill showed a deep scar -- a fissure or hollow. We approached it\r\ncautiously. It was not easy to see how deep it was, and whether it\r\nhad an invisible connection with Nelson on the other side of the\r\nvalley. But this was not the case. On a closer examination this deep\r\ncleft proved to have a solid, filled-up bottom. Between the ridges\r\nthe surface was perfectly flat, and offered an excellent site for\r\na dog-camp.\r\n\r\nCaptain Nilsen and I had worked out a kind of programme of the work to\r\nbe done, and in this it was decided that the dogs should be brought\r\non to the Barrier as quickly as possible, and there looked after\r\nby two men. We chose this place for the purpose. The old pressure\r\nridges told the history of the spot plainly enough; we had no need\r\nto fear any kind of disturbance here. The site had the additional\r\nadvantage that we could see the ship from it, and would always be in\r\ncommunication with those on board.\r\n\r\nFrom here the valley turned slightly to the south. After having\r\nmarked the spot where our first tent was to be set up, we continued\r\nour investigations. The valley sloped gradually upwards, and reached\r\nthe ridge at a height of 100 feet. From this elevation we had an\r\nexcellent view over the valley we had been following, and all the other\r\nsurroundings. On the north the Barrier extended, level and straight,\r\napparently without interruption, and ended on the west in the steep\r\ndescent of Cape Man's Head, which formed the eastern limit of the inner\r\npart of the Bay of Whales, and afforded a snug little corner, where we\r\nhad found room for our ship. There lay the whole of the inner part of\r\nthe bay, bounded on all sides by ice, ice and nothing but ice-Barrier\r\nas far as we could see, white and blue. This spot would no doubt show\r\na surprising play of colour later on; it promised well in this way.\r\n\r\nThe ridge we were standing on was not broad -- about two hundred yards,\r\nI think -- and in many places it was swept quite bare by the wind,\r\nshowing the blue ice itself. We passed over it and made for the pass\r\nof Thermopylae, which extended in a southerly direction from the\r\nridge and after a very slight descent was merged in a great plain,\r\nsurrounded by elevations on all sides -- a basin, in fact. The bare\r\nridge we passed over to descend into the basin was a good deal broken\r\nup; but the fissures were narrow, and almost entirely filled up again\r\nwith drift, so that they were not dangerous. The basin gave us the\r\nimpression of being sheltered and cosy, and, above all, it looked\r\nsafe and secure. This stretch of ice was -- with the exception of a\r\nfew quite small hummocks of the shape of haycocks -- perfectly flat\r\nand free from crevasses.\r\n\r\nWe crossed it, and went up on the ridge that rose very gently on the\r\nsouth. From the top of this all was flat and even as far as we could\r\nsee; but that was not saying much. For a little while we continued\r\nalong the ridge in an easterly direction without finding any place\r\nthat was specially suited for our purpose. Our thoughts returned to\r\nthe basin as the best sheltered place we had seen.\r\n\r\nFrom the height we were now on, we could look down into the\r\nsouth-eastern part of the Bay of Whales. In contrast to that part\r\nof the ice-foot to which we had made fast, the inner bay seemed to\r\nconsist of ice that had been forced up by pressure. But we had to leave\r\na closer examination of this part till later. We all liked the basin,\r\nand agreed to choose it as our future abode, And so we turned and went\r\nback again. It did not take long to reach the plain in our own tracks.\r\n\r\nOn making a thorough examination of the surface and discussing the\r\nvarious possibilities, we came to the conclusion that a site for the\r\nhut was to be looked for on the little elevation that rose to the\r\neast. It seemed that we should be more snug there than anywhere else,\r\nand we were not mistaken. We soon made up our minds that we had chosen\r\nthe best place the Barrier had to offer. On the spot where the hut\r\nwas to stand we set up another ski-pole, and then went home.\r\n\r\nThe good news that we had already found a favourable place for the\r\nhut naturally caused great satisfaction on all sides. Everyone had\r\nbeen silently dreading the long and troublesome transport over the\r\nIce Barrier.\r\n\r\nThere was teeming life on the ice. Wherever we turned we saw great\r\nherds of seals -- Weddells and crab-eaters. The great sea-leopard,\r\nwhich we had seen occasionally on the floes, was not to be found\r\nhere. During our whole stay in the Bay of Whales we did not see a\r\nsingle specimen of it. Nor did we ever see the Ross seal. Penguins had\r\nnot shown themselves particularly often, only a few here and there;\r\nbut we appreciated them all the more. The few we saw were almost all\r\nAdelie penguins. While we were at work making the ship fast, a flock of\r\nthem suddenly shot up out of the water and on to the ice. They looked\r\nabout them in surprise for a moment: men and ships do not come their\r\nway every day. But it seemed as if their astonishment soon gave way to\r\na desire to see what was happening. They positively sat and studied\r\nall our movements. Only now and then they grunted a little and took\r\na turn over the ice. What specially interested them was evidently\r\nour work at digging holes in the snow for the grapnels. They flocked\r\nabout the men who were engaged in this, laid their heads on one side,\r\nand looked as if they found it immensely interesting. They did not\r\nappear to be the least afraid of us, and for the most part we left\r\nthem in peace. But some of them had to lose their lives; we wanted\r\nthem for our collection.\r\n\r\nAn exciting seal-hunt took place the same day. Three crab-eaters had\r\nventured to approach the ship, and were marked down to increase our\r\nstore of fresh meat. We picked two mighty hunters to secure the prey\r\nfor us; they approached with the greatest caution, though this was\r\naltogether unnecessary, for the seals lay perfectly motionless. They\r\ncrept forward in Indian fashion, with their heads down and their\r\nbacks bent. This looks fine; I chuckle and laugh, but still with a\r\ncertain decorum. Then there is a report. Two of the sleeping seals\r\ngive a little spasm, and do not move again. It is otherwise with the\r\nthird. With snakelike movements it wriggles away through the loose snow\r\nwith surprising speed. It is no longer target practice, but hunting\r\nreal game, and the result is in keeping with it. Bang! bang! and\r\nbang again. It is a good thing we have plenty of ammunition. One of\r\nthe hunters uses up all his cartridges and has to go back, but the\r\nother sets off in pursuit of the game. Oh, how I laughed! Decorum\r\nwas no longer possible; I simply shook with laughter. Away they\r\nwent through the loose snow, the seal first and the hunter after. I\r\ncould see by the movements of the pursuer that he was furious. He\r\nsaw that he was in for something which he could not come out of with\r\ndignity. The seal made off at such a pace that it filled the air with\r\nsnow. Although the snow was fairly deep and loose, the seal kept on\r\nthe surface. Not so the hunter: he sank over the knees at every step,\r\nand in a short time was completely outdistanced. From time to time\r\nhe halted, aimed, and fired. He himself afterwards asserted that\r\nevery shot had hit. I had my doubts. In any case the seal seemed to\r\ntake no notice of them, for it went on with undiminished speed. At\r\nlast the mighty man gave up and turned back. \"Beastly hard to kill,\"\r\nI heard him say, as he came on board. I suppressed a smile -- did\r\nnot want to hurt the fellow's feelings.\r\n\r\nWhat an evening! The sun is high in the heavens in spite of the late\r\nhour. Over all this mountainous land of ice, over the mighty Barrier\r\nrunning south, there lies a bright, white, shining light, so intense\r\nthat it dazzles the eyes. But northward lies the night. Leaden grey\r\nupon the sea, it passes into deep blue as the eye is raised, and pales\r\nby degrees until it is swallowed up in the radiant gleam from the\r\nBarrier. What lies behind the night -- that smoke-black mass -- we\r\nknow. That part we have explored, and have come off victorious. But\r\nwhat does the dazzling day to the south conceal? Inviting and\r\nattractive the fair one lies before us. Yes, we hear you calling,\r\nand we shall come. You shall have your kiss, if we pay for it with\r\nour lives.\r\n\r\nThe following day -- Sunday -- brought the same fine weather. Of\r\ncourse, there could now be no thought of Sunday for us. Not one of\r\nus would have cared to spend the day in idleness. We were now divided\r\ninto two parties: the sea party and the land party. The sea party --\r\nten men -- took over the Fram, while on this day the land party took\r\nup their abode on the Barrier for a year or two, or whatever it might\r\nbe. The sea party was composed of Nilsen, Gjertsen, Beck, Sundbeck,\r\nLudvig Hansen, Kristensen, Ronne, Nodtvedt, Kutschin, and Olsen. The\r\nland party consisted of Prestrud, Johansen, Helmer Hanssen, Hassel,\r\nBjaaland, Stubberud, Lindstrom, and myself. Lindstrom was to stay\r\non board for a few days longer, as we still had to take most of our\r\nmeals on the ship. The plan was that one party, composed of six men,\r\nshould camp in a sixteen-man tent in the space between Ronniken and\r\nNelson, while another party of two were to live in a tent up at the\r\nbut site and build the hut. The two last were, of course, our capable\r\ncarpenters, Bjaaland and Stubberud.\r\n\r\nBy eleven o'clock in the morning we were at last ready to start. We had\r\none sledge, eight dogs and provisions and equipment weighing altogether\r\n660 pounds. It was my team that was to open the ball. The sea party\r\nhad all collected on deck to witness the first start. All was now\r\nready; after countless efforts on our part, or, if it is preferred,\r\nafter a thorough thrashing for every dog, we had at last got them in a\r\nline before the sledge in Alaska harness. With a flourish and a crack\r\nof the whip we set off. I glanced at the ship. Yes; as I thought --\r\nall our comrades were standing in a row, admiring the fine start. I am\r\nnot quite sure that I did not hold my head rather high and look round\r\nwith a certain air of triumph. If I did so, it was foolish of me. I\r\nought to have waited; the defeat would have been easier to bear. For\r\ndefeat it was, and a signal one. The dogs had spent half a year in\r\nlying about and eating and drinking, and had got the impression that\r\nthey would never have anything else to do. Not one of them appeared\r\nto understand that a new era of toil had begun. After moving forward\r\na few yards, they all sat down, as though at a word of command,\r\nand stared at each other. The most undisguised astonishment could be\r\nread in their faces. When at last we had succeeded, with another dose\r\nof the whip, in making them understand that we really asked them to\r\nwork, instead of doing as they were told they flew at each other in a\r\nfurious scrimmage. Heaven help me! what work we had with those eight\r\ndogs that day! If it was going to be like this on the way to the Pole,\r\nI calculated in the midst of the tumult that it would take exactly a\r\nyear to get there, without counting the return journey. During all this\r\nconfusion I stole another glance at the ship, but the sight that met me\r\nmade me quickly withdraw my eyes again. They were simply shrieking with\r\nlaughter, and loud shouts of the most infamous encouragement reached\r\nus. \"If you go on like that, you'll get there by Christmas,\" or,\r\n\"Well done! stick to it. Now you're off.\" We were stuck faster than\r\never. Things looked desperate. At last, with the combined strength\r\nof all the animals and men, we got the sledge to move again.\r\n\r\nSo our first sledge trip could not be called a triumph. We then set\r\nup our first tent on the Barrier, between Mounts Nelson and Ronniken\r\n-- a large, strong tent for sixteen men, with the sheet for the floor\r\nsewed on. Round the tent wire ropes were stretched in a triangle, fifty\r\nyards on each side. To these the dogs were to be tethered. The tent was\r\nfurnished with five sleeping-bags and a quantity of provisions. The\r\ndistance we had come was 1.2 geographical miles, or 2.2 kilometres,\r\nmeasured by sledge-meter. After finishing this work, we went on up\r\nto the site selected for the station. Here we set up the tent --\r\na similar tent to the other, for sixteen men -- for the use of the\r\ncarpenters, and marked out the hut site. According to the lie of\r\nthe ground we elected to make the house face east and west, and not\r\nnorth and south, as one might have been tempted to do, since it was\r\nusually supposed that the most frequent and violent winds came from\r\nthe south. We chose rightly. The prevailing wind was from the east,\r\nand thus caught our house on its most protected short wall. The door\r\nfaced west. When this work was done, we marked out the way from here\r\nto the encampment below and thence to the vessel with dark flags\r\nat every fifteen paces. In this way we should be able to drive with\r\ncertainty from one place to another without losing time if a storm\r\nshould set in. The distance from the hut site to the vessel was 2.2\r\ngeographical miles, or 4 kilometres. On Monday, January 16, work began\r\nin earnest. About eighty dogs -- six teams -- drove up to the first\r\nencampment with all the provisions and equipment that could be loaded\r\non the sledges, and twenty dogs -- Stubberud's and Bjaaland's teams --\r\nwent with a full load up to the other camp. We had some work indeed,\r\nthose first days, to get the dogs to obey us. Time after time they\r\ntried to take the command from their masters and steer their own\r\ncourse. More than once it cost us a wet shirt to convince them that\r\nwe really were the masters. It was strenuous work, but it succeeded\r\nin the end. Poor dogs! they got plenty of thrashing in those days. Our\r\nhours were long; we seldom turned in before eleven at night, and were\r\nup again at five. But it did not seem particularly hard; we were\r\nall alike eager for the work to be finished as soon as possible,\r\nso that the Fram might get away. The harbour arrangements were not\r\nof the best. The quay she was moored to suddenly broke in pieces,\r\nand all hands had to turn out to make her fast to a new quay. Perhaps\r\nthey had just got to sleep again when the same operation had to be\r\nrepeated; for the ice broke time after time, and kept the unfortunate\r\n\"sea-rovers\" in constant activity. It is enervating work being always\r\nat one's post, and sleeping with one eye open. They had a hard time to\r\ncontend with, our ten comrades, and the calm way in which they took\r\neverything was extraordinary. They were always in a good humour, and\r\nalways had a joke ready. It was the duty of the sea party to bring up\r\nall the provisions and outfit for the wintering party from the hold,\r\nand put them on the ice. Then the land party removed them. This work\r\nproceeded very smoothly, and it was rare that one party had to wait\r\nfor the other. During the first few days of sledging all the members\r\nof the land party became quite hoarse, some of them so badly that\r\nthey almost lost their voices. This came from the continual yelling\r\nand shouting that we had to do at first to make the dogs go. But this\r\ngave the sea party a welcome opportunity of finding us a nickname;\r\nwe were called \"the chatterers.\"\r\n\r\nApart from the unpleasantness of constantly changing the anchorage,\r\non account of the breaking up and drifting out of the ice, the\r\nharbour must in other respects be regarded as very good. A little\r\nswell might set in from time to time and cause some disagreeable\r\nbumping, but never anything to embarrass the vessel. One very great\r\nadvantage was that the currents in this corner always set outward,\r\nand thus kept off all icebergs. The sledging between the ship and\r\nthe Barrier was done by five men to begin with, as the carpenters\r\nwere engaged in building the house. One man had also to be told off\r\nas tent guard, for we could not use more than half our teams -- six\r\ndogs -- at a time. If we harnessed the full team of twelve, we only\r\nhad trouble and fights. The dogs which were thus left behind had to\r\nbe looked after, and a man was required for this duty. Another of\r\nthe duties of the tent guard was to cook the day's food and keep the\r\ntent tidy. It was a coveted position, and lots were cast for it. It\r\ngave a little variety in the continual sledging.\r\n\r\nOn January 17 the carpenters began to dig the foundations of the\r\nhouse. The effect of all we had heard about the Antarctic storms was\r\nthat we decided to take every possible precaution to make the house\r\nstand on an even keel. The carpenters therefore began by digging\r\na foundation 4 feet down into the Barrier. This was not easy work;\r\n2 feet below the surface they came upon hard, smooth ice, and had to\r\nuse pickaxes. The same day a stiff easterly breeze sprang up, whirling\r\nthe snow high into the air, and filling up the foundations as fast\r\nas the men dug them. But it would take more than that to stop those\r\nfellows in their work. They built a wind-screen of planks, and did\r\nit so well that they were able to work all day, unhindered by drifts,\r\nuntil, when evening came, they had the whole foundation dug out. There\r\nis no difficulty in doing good work when one has such people to work\r\nfor one. The stormy weather interfered somewhat with our sledging,\r\nand as we found our Alaska harness unsuitable to the conditions,\r\nwe went on board and began the preparation of Greenland harness for\r\nour dogs. All hands worked at it. Our excellent sailmaker, Ronne,\r\nsewed forty-six sets of harness in the course of the month. The rest\r\nof us spliced the ropes and made the necessary tackles, while others\r\nspliced wire-rope shafts to our sledges. When evening came we had\r\nan entirely new set of tackle for all our sledges and dogs. This was\r\nvery successful, and in a few days the whole was working smoothly.\r\n\r\nWe had now divided ourselves between the two tents, so that five men\r\nslept in the lower tent, while the two carpenters and I inhabited the\r\nupper one. That evening a rather amusing thing happened to us. We were\r\njust turning in when suddenly we heard a penguin's cry immediately\r\noutside the tent. We were out in a moment. There, a few yards from the\r\ndoor, sat a big Emperor penguin, making bow after bow. It gave exactly\r\nthe impression of having come up simply to pay us its respects. We\r\nwere sorry to repay its attention so poorly, but such is the way of\r\nthe world. With a final bow it ended its days in the frying-pan.\r\n\r\nOn January 18 we began bringing up the materials for the hut,\r\nand as soon as they arrived the builders began to put them up. It\r\nis no exaggeration to say that everything went like a well-oiled\r\nmachine. One sledge after another drove up to the site and discharged\r\nits load. The dogs worked splendidly, and their drivers no less,\r\nand as fast as the materials arrived our future home rose into\r\nthe air. All the parts had been marked before leaving Norway,\r\nand were now discharged from the ship in the order in which they\r\nwere wanted. Besides which, Stubberud himself had built the house,\r\nso that he knew every peg of it. It is with gladness and pride that\r\nI look back upon those days. With gladness, because no discord was\r\never heard in the course of this fairly severe labour; with pride,\r\nbecause I was at the head of such a body of men. For men they were,\r\nin the true sense of the word. Everyone knew his duty, and did it.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the wind dropped and the morning brought the\r\nfinest weather, calm and clear. It was a pleasure to work on days\r\nlike this. Both men and dogs were in the best of spirits. On these\r\njourneys between the ship and the station we were constantly hunting\r\nseals, but we only took those that came in our way. We never had to\r\ngo far to find fresh meat. We used to come suddenly upon a herd of\r\nthem; they were then shot, flayed, and loaded on the sledges with the\r\nprovisions and building materials. The dogs feasted in those days --\r\nthey had as much warm flesh as they wanted.\r\n\r\nOn January 20 we had taken up all the building materials, and could\r\nthen turn our attention to provisions and stores. The work went\r\nmerrily, backwards and forwards, and the journey to the Fram in the\r\nmorning with empty sledges was specially enjoyable. The track was\r\nnow well worn and hard, and resembled a good Norwegian country road\r\nmore than anything else. The going was splendid. On coming out of the\r\ntent at six o'clock in the morning one was instantly greeted with\r\njoy by one's own twelve dogs. They barked and howled in emulation,\r\ntugged and jerked at their chains to get to their master, and jumped\r\nand danced about with joy. Then one would first go down the line and\r\nsay \"Good-morning\" to each of them in turn, patting them and saying a\r\nfew words. Splendid beasts they were. The one who was taken notice of\r\nshowed every sign of happiness. The most petted of our domestic dogs\r\ncould not have shown greater devotion than these tamed wolves. All the\r\ntime the others were yelling and pulling at their chains to get at the\r\none who was being petted, for they are jealous in the extreme. When\r\nthey had all received their share of attention the harness was brought\r\nout, and then the jubilation broke out afresh. Strange as it may\r\nseem, I can assert that these animals love their harness. Although\r\nthey must know that it means hard work, they all show signs of the\r\ngreatest rapture at the sight of it. I must hasten to add, however,\r\nthat this only happens at home. Long and fatiguing sledge journeys\r\nshow a very different state of things. When it came to harnessing,\r\nthe first trouble of the day began. It was impossible to get them to\r\nstand still. The full meal of the previous evening, followed by the\r\nnight's rest, had given them such a superabundance of energy and joy\r\nof life that nothing could make them stand still. They had to have a\r\ntaste of the whip, and yet it was a pity to start that. After having\r\nsecurely anchored the sledge, one was ready at last with one's team\r\nof six dogs harnessed. Now it might be thought that all was plain\r\nsailing and that one had only to cast off one's moorings and be taken\r\nstraight down to the ship. But that was far from being the case. Round\r\nabout the camp a number of objects had collected in a short time,\r\nsuch as packing-cases, building materials, empty sledges, etc., and to\r\nsteer clear of these was the great problem of the morning. The dogs'\r\ngreatest interest was, of course, concentrated upon these objects,\r\nand one had to be extremely lucky to avoid a spill.\r\n\r\nLet us follow one of these morning drives. The men are all ready\r\nand have their dogs well harnessed. One, two, three, and we let them\r\nall go at once. We are off like the wind, and before one has time to\r\nswing the whip one finds oneself in the middle of a heap of building\r\nmaterials. The dogs have achieved the desire of their lives -- to\r\nbe able to make a thorough investigation of these materials in the\r\nway that is so characteristic of the dog and so incomprehensible\r\nto us. While this process is going on with the greatest enjoyment,\r\nthe driver has got clear of the sledge and begins to distentangle\r\nthe traces, which have wound themselves round planks and posts and\r\nwhatever else maybe lying handy. He is far from having achieved the\r\ndesire of his life -- to judge from the expressions he uses. At last\r\nhe is clear again. He looks round first and finds he is not the only\r\none who has met with difficulties in the way. Over there among the\r\ncases he sees a performance going on which makes his heart leap with\r\njoy. One of the old hands has come to grief, and in so decisive a\r\nfashion that it will take him a long time to get clear again. With a\r\ntriumphant smile he throws himself on the sledge and drives off. So\r\nlong as he is on the Barrier as a rule everything goes well; there\r\nis nothing here to distract the dogs. It is otherwise when he comes\r\ndown to the sea-ice. Here seals lie scattered about in groups basking\r\nin the sunshine, and it may easily happen that his course will be\r\nrather crooked. If a team of fresh dogs have made up their minds\r\nto turn aside in the direction of a herd of seals, it takes a very\r\nexperienced driver to get them in the right way again. Personally,\r\non such occasions, I used the only remedy I could see -- namely,\r\ncapsizing the sledge. In loose snow with the sledge upset they soon\r\npulled up. Then, if one was wise, one put them on the right course\r\nagain quietly and calmly, hoisted the sledge on to an even keel,\r\nand went on. But one is not always wise, unfortunately. The desire to\r\nbe revenged on the disobedient rascals gets the upper hand, and one\r\nbegins to deal out punishment. But this is not so easy as it seems. So\r\nlong as you are sitting on the capsized sledge it makes a good anchor,\r\nbut now -- without a load -- it is no use, and the dogs know that. So\r\nwhile you are thrashing one the others start off, and the result is\r\nnot always flattering to the driver. If he is lucky he gets on to the\r\ncapsized sledge again, but we have seen dogs and sledges arrive without\r\ndrivers. All this trouble in the early morning sets the blood in active\r\ncirculation, and one arrives at the ship drenched with perspiration,\r\nin spite of a temperature of -5deg.F. But it sometimes happens that there\r\nis no interruption, and then the drive is soon over. The dogs want\r\nno encouragement; they are willing enough. The mile and a quarter\r\nfrom the lower camp to the Fram is then covered in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nWhen we came out of the tent on the morning of January 21 we were\r\ngreatly surprised. We thought we must be mistaken, rubbed our eyes,\r\nopened them wider; but no, it was no good. The Fram was no longer\r\nto be seen. It had been blowing pretty strongly during the night,\r\nwith snow-squalls. Presumably the weather had forced them to put\r\nout. We could also hear the roar of the sea dashing against the\r\nBarrier. Meanwhile we lost no time. The day before Captain Nilsen and\r\nKristensen had shot forty seals, and of these we had brought in half\r\nthe same day. We now began to fetch in the rest. During the forenoon,\r\nwhile we were flaying and shooting seals, we heard the old, well-known\r\nsound -- put, put, put -- of the Fram's motor, and presently the\r\ncrow's-nest appeared above the Barrier. But she did not get into her\r\nold berth before evening. A heavy swell had forced her to go outside.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the carpenters were busily constructing the hut. By January\r\n21 the roof was on, and the rest of the work could thus be done under\r\ncover. This was a great comfort to the men; at that time their job\r\nwas undoubtedly the worst of any. Bitterly cold it was for them,\r\nbut I never heard them talk about it. When I came up to the tent\r\nafter the day's work, one of them was busy cooking. The meal always\r\nconsisted of pancakes and pitch-black, strong coffee. How good it\r\ntasted! A rivalry soon arose between the two cook-carpenters as to\r\nwhich of them could make the best pancakes. I think they were both\r\nclever at it. In the morning we had pancakes again -- crisp, hot,\r\ndelicate pancakes, with the most glorious coffee -- before I was even\r\nout of my sleeping-bag. That is what the carpenters had to offer me at\r\nfive o'clock in the morning. No wonder I enjoyed their society. Nor\r\ndid the men in the lower camp suffer any privation. Wisting showed\r\nhimself to be possessed of eminent talents as cook for the day. His\r\nspecial dish was penguins and skua gulls in cream sauce. It was served\r\nunder the name of ptarmigan, of which it really reminded one.\r\n\r\nThat Sunday we all went on board -- with the exception of the necessary\r\ntent guards for both camps -- and enjoyed life. We had worked hard\r\nenough that week.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, January 23, we began to carry up the provisions. In order\r\nto save time, we had decided not to bring the provisions right up to\r\nthe hut, but to store them for the time being on an elevation that\r\nlay on the other side, to the south of Mount Nelson. This spot was\r\nnot more than 600 yards from the hut, but as the surface was rather\r\nrough here, we should save a good deal in the long-run. Afterwards\r\nwhen the Fram had sailed, we could take them the rest of the way. As\r\nit turned out, we never had time for this, so that our main store\r\nremained here. Sledging up to this point offered some difficulties at\r\nfirst. The dogs, who were accustomed to take the road to the lower camp\r\n-- between Nelson and Ronniken -- could not understand why they might\r\nnot do the same now. The journey with empty sledges down to the ship\r\nwas often particularly troublesome. From this point the dogs could\r\nhear their companions on the other side of Nelson in the lower camp,\r\nand then it happened more than once that the dogs took command. If they\r\nonce got in the humour for playing tricks of that sort, it was by no\r\nmeans easy to get them under control. We all of us had this experience\r\nwithout exception. Not one of us escaped this little extra turn. As\r\nthe provisions came up each driver took them off his sledge, and laid\r\nthe cases in the order in which they should lie. We began by placing\r\neach sort by itself in small groups over the slope. This plan had the\r\nadvantage that everything would be easy to find. The load was usually\r\n660 pounds, or 6 cases to each sledge. We had about 900 cases to bring\r\nup, and reckoned that we should have them all in place in the course\r\nof a week. Everything went remarkably well according to our reckoning.\r\n\r\nBy noon on Saturday, January 28, the hut was ready, and all the 900\r\ncases were in place. The depot of provisions had quite an imposing\r\nappearance. Great rows of cases stood in the snow, all with their\r\nnumbers outward, so that we could find what we wanted at once. And\r\nthere was the house, all finished, exactly as it had stood in its\r\nnative place on Bundefjord. But it would be difficult to imagine more\r\ndifferent surroundings: there, green pinewoods and splashing water;\r\nhere, ice, nothing but ice. But both scenes were beautiful; I stood\r\nthinking which I preferred. My thoughts travelled far -- thousands\r\nof miles in a second. It was the forest that gained the day.\r\n\r\nAs I have already mentioned, we had everything with us for fastening\r\nthe but down to the Barrier, but the calm weather we had had all the\r\ntime led us to suppose that the conditions would not be so bad as we\r\nhad expected. We were therefore satisfied with the foundation dug in\r\nthe Barrier. The outside of the but was tarred, and the roof covered\r\nwith tarred paper, so that it was very visible against the white\r\nsurroundings. That afternoon we broke up both camps, and moved into\r\nour home, \"Framheim.\" What a snug, cosy, and cleanly impression it\r\ngave us when we entered the door! Bright, new linoleum everywhere --\r\nin the kitchen as well as in our living-room. We had good reason to be\r\nhappy. Another important point had been got over, and in much shorter\r\ntime than I had ever hoped. Our path to the goal was opening up; we\r\nbegan to have a glimpse of the castle in the distance. The Beauty is\r\nstill sleeping, but the kiss is coming, the kiss that shall wake her!\r\n\r\nIt was a happy party that assembled in the hut the first evening,\r\nand drank to the future to the music of the gramophone. All the\r\nfull-grown dogs were now brought up here, and were fastened to\r\nwire ropes stretched in a square, 50 yards on each side. It may be\r\nbelieved that they gave us some music. Collected as they were, they\r\nperformed under the leadership of some great singer or other daily,\r\nand, what was worse, nightly concerts. Strange beasts! what can they\r\nhave meant by this howling? One began, then two, then a few more, and,\r\nfinally, the whole hundred. As a rule, during a concert like this they\r\nsit well down, stretch their heads as high in the air as they can,\r\nand howl to their hearts' content. During this act they seem very\r\npreoccupied, and are not easily disturbed. But the strangest thing\r\nis the way the concert comes to an end. It stops suddenly along the\r\nwhole line -- no stragglers, no \"one cheer more.\" What is it that\r\nimposes this simultaneous stop? I have observed and studied it time\r\nafter time without result. One would think it was a song that had been\r\nlearnt. Do these animals possess a power of communicating with each\r\nother? The question is extraordinarily interesting. No one among us,\r\nwho has had long acquaintance with Eskimo dogs, doubts that they have\r\nthis power. I learned at last to understand their different sounds\r\nso well that I could tell by their voices what was going on without\r\nseeing them. Fighting, play, love-making, etc., each had its special\r\nsound. If they wanted to express their devotion and affection for\r\ntheir master, they would do it in a quite different way. If one of\r\nthem was doing something wrong -- something they knew they were not\r\nallowed to do, such as breaking into a meat-store, for example --\r\nthe others, who could not get in, ran out and gave vent to a sound\r\nquite different from those I have mentioned. I believe most of us\r\nlearned to distinguish these different sounds. There can hardly be\r\na more interesting animal to observe, or one that offers greater\r\nvariety of study, than the Eskimo dog. From his ancestor the wolf\r\nhe has inherited the instinct of self-preservation -- the right of\r\nthe stronger -- in a far higher degree than our domestic dog. The\r\nstruggle for life has brought him to early maturity, and given him\r\nsuch qualities as frugality and endurance in an altogether surprising\r\ndegree. His intelligence is sharp, clear, and well developed for the\r\nwork he is born to, and the conditions in which he is brought up. We\r\nmust not call the Eskimo dog slow to learn because he cannot sit up\r\nand take sugar when he is told; these are things so widely separated\r\nfrom the serious business of his life that he will never be able to\r\nunderstand them, or only with great difficulty. Among themselves the\r\nright of the stronger is the only law. The strongest rules, and does\r\nas he pleases undisputedly; everything belongs to him. The weaker ones\r\nget the crumbs. Friendship easily springs up between these animals --\r\nalways combined with respect and fear of the stronger. The weaker,\r\nwith his instinct of self-preservation, seeks the protection of the\r\nstronger. The stronger accepts the position of protector, and thereby\r\nsecures a trusty helper, always with the thought of one stronger than\r\nhimself. The instinct of self-preservation is to be found everywhere,\r\nand it is so, too, with their relations with man. The dog has learnt to\r\nvalue man as his benefactor, from whom he receives everything necessary\r\nfor his support. Affection and devotion seem also to have their part in\r\nthese relations, but no doubt on a closer examination the instinct of\r\nself-preservation is at the root of all. As a consequence of this, his\r\nrespect for his master is far greater than in our domestic dog, with\r\nwhom respect only exists as a consequence of the fear of a beating. I\r\ncould without hesitation take the food out of the mouth of any one\r\nof my twelve dogs; not one of them would attempt to bite me. And\r\nwhy? Because their respect, as a consequence of the fear of getting\r\nnothing next time, was predominant. With my dogs at home I certainly\r\nshould not try the same thing. They would at once defend their food,\r\nand, if necessary, they would not shrink from using their teeth; and\r\nthis in spite of the fact that these dogs have to all appearance the\r\nsame respect as the others. What, then, is the reason? It is that\r\nthis respect is not based on a serious foundation -- the instinct\r\nof self-preservation -- but simply on the fear of a hiding. A case\r\nlike this proves that the foundation is too weak; the desire of food\r\novercomes the fear of the stick, and the result is a snap.\r\n\r\nA few days later the last member of the wintering party -- Adolf Henrik\r\nLindstrom -- joined us, and with his arrival our arrangements might be\r\nregarded as complete. He had stayed on board hitherto, attending to\r\nthe cooking there, but now he was no longer necessary. His art would\r\nbe more appreciated among the \"chatterers.\" The youngest member of\r\nthe expedition -- the cook Karinius Olsen -- took over from that day\r\nthe whole of the cooking on the Fram, and performed this work in an\r\nextremely conscientious and capable way until the ship reached Hobart\r\nin March, 1912, when he again had assistance. This was well done for\r\na lad of twenty. I wish we had many like him.\r\n\r\nWith Lindstrom, then, the kitchen and the daily bread were in\r\norder. The smoke rose gaily from the shining black chimney, and\r\nproclaimed that now the Barrier was really inhabited. How cosy it was,\r\nwhen we came sledging up after the day's work, to see that smoke rising\r\ninto the air. It is a little thing really, but nevertheless it means\r\nso much. With Lindstrom came not only food, but light and air -- both\r\nof them his specialities. The Lux lamp was the first thing he rigged\r\nup, giving us a light that contributed much to the feeling of comfort\r\nand well-being through the long winter. He also provided us with air,\r\nbut in this he had Stubberud as a partner. These two together managed\r\nto give us the finest, purest Barrier air in our room during the whole\r\nstay. It is true that this was not done without hard work, but they did\r\nnot mind that. The ventilation was capricious, and liable to fail now\r\nand then. This usually happened when there was a dead calm. Many were\r\nthe ingenious devices employed by the firm to set the business going\r\nagain. Generally a Primus stove was used under the exhaust pipe, and\r\nice applied to the supply pipe. While one of them lay on his stomach\r\nwith the Primus under the exhaust, drawing the air up that way,\r\nthe other ran up to the roof and dropped big lumps of snow down the\r\nsupply to get the air in that way. In this fashion they could keep it\r\ngoing by the hour together without giving up. It finally ended in the\r\nventilation becoming active again without visible cause. There is no\r\ndoubt that the system of ventilation in a winter-station like ours\r\nis of great importance, both to health and comfort. I have read of\r\nexpeditions, the members of which were constantly suffering from cold\r\nand damp and resulting sickness. This is nothing but a consequence\r\nof bad ventilation. If the supply of fresh air is sufficient, the\r\nfuel will be turned to better account, and the production of warmth\r\nwill, of course, be greater. If the supply of air is insufficient,\r\na great part of the fuel will be lost in an unconsumed state, and\r\ncold and damp will be the result. There must, of course, be a means\r\nof regulating the ventilation in accordance with requirements. We\r\nused only the Lux lamp in our hut, besides the stove in the kitchen,\r\nand with this we kept our room so warm that those of us in the upper\r\nberths were constantly complaining of the warmth.\r\n\r\nOriginally there were places for ten bunks in the room, but as\r\nthere were only nine of us, one of the bunks was removed and the\r\nspace used for our chronometer locker. This contained three ordinary\r\nship's chronometers. We had, in addition, six chronometer watches,\r\nwhich we wore continually, and which were compared throughout the\r\nwhole winter. The meteorological instruments found a place in the\r\nkitchen -- the only place we had for them. Lindstrom undertook the\r\nposition of sub-director of the Framheim meteorological station and\r\ninstrument-maker to the expedition. Under the roof were stowed all the\r\nthings that would not stand severe frost, such as medicines, syrup,\r\njam, cream, pickles, and sauces, besides all our sledge-boxes. A\r\nplace was also made for the library under the roof.\r\n\r\nThe week beginning on Monday, January 30, was spent in bringing\r\nup coal, wood, oil, and our whole supply of dried fish. The\r\ntemperature this summer varied between +5deg. and -13deg.F. -- a grand\r\nsummer temperature. We also shot many seals daily, and we already\r\nhad a great pile of about a hundred of them lying just outside the\r\ndoor of the hut. One evening as we were sitting at supper Lindstrom\r\ncame in to tell us that we need not go down any more to the sea-ice\r\nto shoot them, as they were coming up to us. We went out and found\r\nhe was right. Not far away, and making straight for the hut, came\r\na crab-eater, shining like silver in the sun. He came right up,\r\nwas photographed, and -- shot.\r\n\r\nOne day I had a rather curious experience. My best dog, Lassesen, had\r\nhis left hind-paw frozen quite white. It happened while we were all out\r\nsledging. Lassesen was a lover of freedom, and had seen his chance of\r\ngetting loose when unobserved. He used his freedom, like most of these\r\ndogs, for fighting. They love fighting, and cannot resist it. He had\r\npicked a quarrel with Odin and Thor, and started a battle with them. In\r\nthe course of the fight the chains that fastened these two had got\r\nwound round Lassesen's leg, and twisted so that the circulation was\r\nstopped. How long he had been standing so I do not know. But when I\r\ncame, I saw at once that the dog was in the wrong place. On a closer\r\nexamination I discovered the frost-bite. I then spent half an hour in\r\nrestoring the circulation. I succeeded in doing this by holding the\r\npaw continuously in my warm hand. At first, while there was no feeling\r\nin the limb, it went well; but when the blood began to flow back,\r\nof course it was painful, and Lassesen became impatient. He whined,\r\nand motioned with his head towards the affected place, as though he\r\nwanted to tell me that he found the operation unpleasant. He made no\r\nattempt to snap. The paw swelled a good deal after this treatment,\r\nbut next day Lassesen was as well as ever, though a little lame in\r\nthat leg.\r\n\r\nThe entries in my diary at this time are all in telegraphic style,\r\nno doubt owing to the amount of work. Thus an entry in February ends\r\nwith the following words: \"An Emperor penguin just come on a visit --\r\nsoup-kettle.\" He did not get a very long epitaph.\r\n\r\nDuring this week we relieved the sea party of the last of the dogs\r\n-- about twenty puppies. There was rejoicing on board when the last\r\nof them left the deck, and, indeed, one could not be surprised. With\r\nthe thermometer about -5deg.F., as it had been lately, it was impossible\r\nto keep the deck clean, as everything froze at once. After they had\r\nall been brought on to the ice, the crew went to work with salt and\r\nwater, and in a short time we recognized the Fram again. The puppies\r\nwere put into boxes and driven up. We had put up a sixteen-man tent\r\nto receive them. From the very first moment they declined to stay in\r\nit, and there was nothing to be done but to let them out. All these\r\npuppies passed a great part of the winter in the open air. So long\r\nas the seals' carcasses were lying on the slope, they stayed there;\r\nafterwards they found another place. But the tent, despised by the\r\nyoungsters, came in useful after all. Any bitch that was going to\r\nhave a litter was put in there, and the tent went by the name of\r\n\"the maternity hospital.\" Then one tent after another was put up, and\r\nFramheim looked quite an important place. Eight of the sixteen-man\r\ntents were set up for our eight teams, two for dried fish, one for\r\nfresh meat, one for cases of provisions, and one for coal and wood --\r\nfourteen altogether. They were arranged according to a plan drawn up\r\nbeforehand, and when they were all up they had quite the appearance\r\nof a camp.\r\n\r\nAt this time our dog-harness underwent important alterations, as one\r\nof the members of the expedition had the happy idea of combining\r\nthe Alaska and the Greenland harness. The result satisfied all\r\nrequirements; in future we always used this construction, and we all\r\nagreed that it was much superior to any other harness. The dogs also\r\nseemed to be more comfortable in it. That they worked better and more\r\neasily is certain, and raw places, so common with Greenland harness,\r\nwere absolutely unknown.\r\n\r\nFebruary 4 was an eventful day. As usual, we all came down to the\r\nFram, driving our empty sledges, at half-past six in the morning. When\r\nthe first man got to the top of the ridge, he began to wave his arms\r\nabout and gesticulate like a madman. I understood, of course, that\r\nhe saw something, but what? The next man gesticulated even worse,\r\nand tried to shout to me. But it was no use; I could not make anything\r\nof it. Then it was my turn to go over the ridge, and, as was natural,\r\nI began to feel rather curious. I had only a few yards more to go --\r\nand then it was explained. Along the edge of the ice, just to the\r\nsouth of the Fram, a large barque lay moored. We had talked of the\r\npossibility of meeting the Terra Nova -- Captain Scott's vessel --\r\nwhen she was on her way to King Edward VII. Land; but it was a great\r\nsurprise all the same. Now it was my turn to wave my arms, and I am\r\nsure I did it no worse than the two first. And the same thing was\r\nrepeated with all of us, as soon as each one reached the top of the\r\nridge. What the last man did I have never been able to find out for\r\ncertain -- but no doubt he waved his arms too. If a stranger had stood\r\nand watched us that morning on the ridge, he would surely have taken\r\nus for a lot of incurable lunatics. The way seemed long that day,\r\nbut at last we got there and heard the full explanation. The Terra\r\nNova had come in at midnight. Our watchman had just gone below for\r\na cup of coffee -- there was no harm in that -- and when he came up\r\nagain, there was another ship lying off the foot of the Barrier. He\r\nrubbed his eyes, pinched his leg, and tried other means of convincing\r\nhimself that he was asleep, but it was no good. The pinch especially,\r\nhe told us afterwards, was horribly painful, and all this led him to\r\nthe conclusion that there really was a second vessel there.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Campbell, the leader of the eastern party, which was\r\nto explore King Edward VII. Land, came on board first, and paid\r\nNilsen a visit. He brought the news that they had not been able to\r\nreach land, and were now on their way back to McMurdo Sound. From\r\nthence it was their intention to go to Cape North and explore the\r\nland there. Immediately after my arrival Lieutenant Campbell came on\r\nboard again and gave me the news himself.\r\n\r\nWe then loaded our sledges and drove home. At nine o'clock we had the\r\ngreat pleasure of receiving Lieutenant Pennell, the commander of the\r\nTerra Nova, Lieutenant Campbell, and the surgeon of the expedition, as\r\nthe first guests in our new home. We spent a couple of very agreeable\r\nhours together. Later in the day three of us paid a visit to the Terra\r\nNova, and stayed on board to lunch. Our hosts were extremely kind,\r\nand offered to take our mail to New Zealand. If I had had time,\r\nI should have been glad to avail myself of this friendly offer,\r\nbut every hour was precious. It was no use to think of writing now.\r\n\r\nAt two o'clock in the afternoon the Terra Nova cast off again,\r\nand left the Bay of Whales. We made a strange discovery after this\r\nvisit. Nearly all of us had caught cold. It did not last long -- only\r\na few hours -- and then it was over. The form it took was sneezing\r\nand cold in the head.\r\n\r\nThe next day -- Sunday, February 5 -- the \"sea rovers,\" as we\r\ncalled the Fram party, were our guests. We had to have them in\r\ntwo detachments, as they could not all leave the ship at the same\r\ntime. Four came to dinner and six to supper. We had not much to offer,\r\nbut we invited them, not so much for the sake of the entertainment\r\nas to show them our new home and wish them a successful voyage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nDepot Journeys\r\n\r\nThere was now too little work for eight of us in bringing up stores\r\nfrom the Fram, and it became evident that some of us might be more\r\nusefully employed elsewhere. It was therefore decided that four\r\nmen should bring ashore the little that remained, while the other\r\nfour went southward to lat. 80deg. S., partly to explore the immediate\r\nneighbourhood, and partly to begin the transport of provisions to the\r\nsouth. This arrangement gave us all enough to do. The four who were\r\nto continue the work at the station -- Wisting, Hassel, Stubberud,\r\nand Bjaaland -- now had as much as their sledges could carry. The\r\nrest of us were busy getting ready. For that matter, everything was\r\nprepared in advance, but as yet we had had no experience of a long\r\njourney. That was what we were going to get now.\r\n\r\nOur departure was fixed for Friday, February 10. On the 9th I went on\r\nboard to say good-bye, as presumably the Fram would have sailed when\r\nwe came back. I had so much to thank all these plucky fellows for. I\r\nknew it was hard for all of them -- almost without exception -- to\r\nhave to leave us now, at the most interesting time, and go out to sea\r\nto battle for months with cold and darkness, ice and storms, and then\r\nhave the same voyage over again the next year when they came to fetch\r\nus. It was certainly a hard task, but none of them complained. They\r\nhad all promised to do their best to promote our common object,\r\nand therefore all went about their duty without grumbling. I left\r\nwritten orders with the commander of the Fram, Captain Nilsen. The\r\nsubstance of these orders may be given in a few words: Carry out\r\nour plan in the way you may think best. I knew the man I was giving\r\norders to. A more capable and honourable second in command I could\r\nnever have had. I knew that the Fram was safe in his hands.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Prestrud and I made a trip to the south to find a suitable\r\nplace for ascending the Barrier on the other side of the bay. The\r\nsea-ice was fairly even for this distance; only a few cracks here\r\nand there. Farther up the bay there were, curiously enough, long\r\nrows of old hummocks. What could this mean? This part was really\r\nquite protected from the sea, so that these formations could not\r\nbe attributed to its action. We hoped to have an opportunity of\r\ninvestigating the conditions more closely later on; there was no time\r\nfor it now. The shortest and most direct way to the south was the one\r\nwe were on now. The bay was not wide here. The distance from Framheim\r\nto this part of the Barrier was about three miles. The ascent of the\r\nBarrier was not difficult; with the exception of a few fissures it\r\nwas quite easy. It did not take long to get up, except perhaps in\r\nthe steepest part. The height was 60 feet. It was quite exciting to\r\ngo up; what should we see at the top? We had never yet had a real\r\nuninterrupted view over the Barrier to the south; this was the first\r\ntime. As it happened, we were not surprised at what we saw when we got\r\nup -- an endless plain, that was lost in the horizon on the extreme\r\nsouth. Our course, we could see, would take us just along the side of\r\nthe ridge before mentioned -- a capital mark for later journeys. The\r\ngoing was excellent; a thin layer of conveniently loose snow was spread\r\nover a hard under-surface, and made it very suitable for skiing. The\r\nlie of the ground told us at once that we had the right pattern of ski\r\n-- the kind for level ground, long and narrow. We had found what we\r\nwanted -- an ascent for our southern journeys and an open road. This\r\nspot was afterwards marked with a flag, and went by the name of \"the\r\nstarting-place.\" On the way back, as on the way out, we passed large\r\nherds of seals, lying asleep. They did not take the least notice\r\nof us. If we went up and woke them, they just raised their heads a\r\nlittle, looked at us for a moment, and then rolled over on the other\r\nside and went to sleep again. It was very evident that these animals\r\nhere on the ice have no enemies. They would certainly have set a watch,\r\nas their brothers in the North do, if they had had anything to fear.\r\n\r\nOn this day we used skin clothing for the first time -- reindeer-skin\r\nclothes of Eskimo cut -- but they proved to be too warm. We had the\r\nsame experience later. In low temperatures these reindeer clothes are\r\nbeyond comparison the best, but here in the South we did not as a rule\r\nhave low temperatures on our sledge journeys. On the few occasions\r\nwhen we experienced any cold worth talking about, we were always\r\nin skins. When we returned in the evening after our reconnoitring,\r\nwe had no need of a Turkish bath.\r\n\r\nOn February 10, at 9.30 a.m., the first expedition left for the\r\nSouth. We were four men, with three sledges and eighteen dogs, six\r\nfor each sledge. The load amounted to about 550 pounds of provisions\r\nper sledge, besides the provisions and outfit for the journey. We\r\ncould not tell, even approximately, how long the journey would take,\r\nas everything was unknown. The chief thing we took on our sledges\r\nwas dogs' pemmican for the depot, 350 pounds per sledge. We also\r\ntook a quantity of seal meat cut into steaks, blubber, dried fish,\r\nchocolate, margarine, and biscuits. We had ten long bamboo poles,\r\nwith black flags, to mark the way. The rest of our outfit consisted\r\nof two three-man tents, four one-man sleeping-bags, and the necessary\r\ncooking utensils.\r\n\r\nThe dogs were very willing, and we left Framheim at full gallop. Along\r\nthe Barrier we went well. Going down to the sea-ice we had to pass\r\nthrough a number of big hummocks -- a fairly rough surface. Nor\r\nwas this without consequences; first one sledge, then another, swung\r\nround. But no harm was done; we got our gear tested, and that is always\r\nan advantage. We also had to pass rather near several large groups of\r\nseals, and the temptation was too great. Away went the dogs to one side\r\nin full gallop towards the seals. But this time the load was heavy,\r\nand they were soon tired of the extra work. In the bay we were in sight\r\nof the Fram. The ice had now given way entirely, so that she lay close\r\nto the Barrier itself. Our four comrades, who were to stay at home,\r\naccompanied us. In the first place, they wanted to see us on our way,\r\nand in the second, they would be able to lend us a hand in getting\r\nup the Barrier, for we were rather apprehensive that it would cost\r\nus a wet shirt. Finally, they were to hunt seals. There was plenty\r\nof opportunity here; where-ever one looked there were seals -- fat\r\nheavy beasts.\r\n\r\nI had put the home party under Wisting's command, and given them\r\nenough work to do. They were to bring up the remainder of the stores\r\nfrom the ship, and to build a large, roomy pent-house against the\r\nwestern wall of the hut, so that we should not have to go directly\r\non to the ice from the kitchen. We also intended to use this as a\r\ncarpenter's workshop. But they were not to forget the seal-hunting,\r\nearly and late. It was important to us to get seals enough to enable\r\nus all, men and dogs, to live in plenty. And there were enough to\r\nbe had. If we ran short of fresh meat in the course of the winter,\r\nit would be entirely our own fault.\r\n\r\nIt was a good thing we had help for the climb. Short as it was,\r\nit caused us a good deal of trouble; but we had dogs enough, and by\r\nharnessing a sufficient number we got the sledges up. I should like\r\nto know what they thought on board. They could see we were already\r\nhard put to it to get up here. What would it be like when we had to\r\nget on to the plateau? I do not know whether they thought of the old\r\nsaying: Practice makes perfect.\r\n\r\nWe halted at the starting-place, where we were to separate from\r\nour comrades. None of us was particularly sentimental. An honest\r\nshake of the hand, and so \"Good-bye.\" The order of our march was as\r\nfollows: Prestrud first on ski, to show the direction and encourage\r\nthe dogs. We always went better with someone going in front. Next\r\ncame Helmer Hanssen. He kept this place on all our journeys -- the\r\nleading sledge. I knew him well from our previous work together,\r\nand regarded him as the most efficient dog-driver I had met. He\r\ncarried the standard compass on his sledge and checked Prestrud's\r\ndirection. After him came Johansen, also with a compass. Lastly,\r\nI came, with sledge-meter and compass. I preferred to take the last\r\nsledge because it enabled me to see what was happening. However careful\r\none may be, it is impossible to avoid dropping things from sledges\r\nin making a journey. If the last man keeps a lookout for such things,\r\ngreat inconvenience may often be avoided. I could mention many rather\r\nimportant things that were dropped in the course of our journeys and\r\npicked up again by the last man. The hardest work, of course, falls on\r\nthe first man. He has to open up the road and drive his dogs forward,\r\nwhile we others have only to follow. All honour, then, to the man who\r\nperformed this task from the first day to the last -- Helmer Hanssen.\r\n\r\nThe position of the \"forerunner\" is not a very enviable one either. Of\r\ncourse he escapes all bother with dogs, but it is confoundedly tedious\r\nto walk there alone, staring at nothing. His only diversion is a\r\nshout from the leading sledge: \"A little to the right,\" \"A little\r\nto the left.\" It is not so much these simple words that divert him\r\nas the tone in which they are called. Now and then the cry comes\r\nin a way that makes him feel he is acquitting himself well. But\r\nsometimes it sends a cold shiver down his back; the speaker might\r\njust as well have added the word \"Duffer!\" -- there is no mistaking\r\nhis tone. It is no easy matter to go straight on a surface without\r\nlandmarks. Imagine an immense plain that you have to cross in thick\r\nfog; it is dead calm, and the snow lies evenly, without drifts. What\r\nwould you do? An Eskimo can manage it, but none of us. We should turn\r\nto the right or to the left, and give the leading dog-driver with the\r\nstandard compass endless trouble. It is strange how this affects the\r\nmind. Although the man with the compass knows quite well that the man\r\nin front cannot do any better, and although he knows that he could not\r\ndo better himself, he nevertheless gets irritated in time and works\r\nhimself into the belief that the unsuspecting, perfectly innocent\r\nleader only takes these turns to annoy him; and so, as I have said,\r\nthe words \"A little to the left\" imply the unspoken addition --\r\nperfectly understood on both sides -- \"Duffer!\" I have personal\r\nexperience of both duties. With the dog-driver time passes far more\r\nquickly. He has his dogs to look after, and has to see that all are\r\nworking and none shirking. Many other points about a team claim his\r\nattention, and he must always keep an eye on the sledge itself. If\r\nhe does not do this, some slight unevenness may throw the runners in\r\nthe air before he knows where he is. And to right a capsized sledge,\r\nweighing about eight hundredweight, is no fun. So, instead of running\r\nthis risk, he gives his whole attention to what is before him.\r\n\r\nFrom the starting-place the Barrier rises very slightly, until at a\r\ncross-ridge it passes into the perfect level. Here on the ridge we\r\nhalt once more. Our comrades have disappeared and gone to their work,\r\nbut in the distance the Fram lies, framed in shining, blue-white\r\nice. We are but human; uncertainty always limits our prospect. Shall\r\nwe meet again? And if so, under what conditions? Much lay between\r\nthat moment and the next time we should see her. The mighty ocean\r\non one side, and the unknown region of ice on the other; so many\r\nthings might happen. Her flag floats out, waves us a last adieu,\r\nand disappears. We are on our way to the South.\r\n\r\nThis first inland trip on the Barrier was undeniably exciting. The\r\nground was absolutely unknown, and our outfit untried. What kind\r\nof country should we have to deal with? Would it continue in this\r\nboundless plain without hindrance of any kind? Or would Nature present\r\ninsurmountable difficulties? Were we right in supposing that dogs were\r\nthe best means of transport in these regions, or should we have done\r\nbetter to take reindeer, ponies, motor-cars, aeroplanes, or anything\r\nelse? We went forward at a rattling pace; the going was perfect. The\r\ndogs' feet trod on a thin layer of loose snow, just enough to give\r\nthem a secure hold.\r\n\r\nThe weather conditions were not quite what we should have wished\r\nin an unknown country. It is true that it was calm and mild, and\r\naltogether pleasant for travelling, but the light was not good. A\r\ngrey haze, the most unpleasant kind of light after fog, lay upon the\r\nlandscape, making the Barrier and the sky merge into one. There was\r\nno horizon to be seen. This grey haze, presumably a younger sister\r\nof fog, is extremely disagreeable. One can never be certain of one's\r\nsurroundings. There are no shadows; everything looks the same. In a\r\nlight like this it is a bad thing to be the forerunner; he does not\r\nsee the inequalities of the ground until too late -- until he is right\r\non them. This often ends in a fall, or in desperate efforts to keep\r\non his feet. It is better for the drivers, they can steady themselves\r\nwith a hand on the sledge. But they also have to be on the lookout for\r\ninequalities, and see that the sledges do not capsize. This light is\r\nalso very trying to the eyes, and one often hears of snow-blindness\r\nafter such a day. The cause of this is not only that one strains one's\r\neyes continually; it is also brought about by carelessness. One is\r\nvery apt to push one's snow-goggles up on to one's forehead, especially\r\nif they are fitted with dark glasses. However, we always came through\r\nit very well; only a few of us had a little touch of this unpleasant\r\ncomplaint. Curiously enough, snow-blindness has something in common\r\nwith seasickness. If you ask a man whether he is seasick, in nine\r\ncases out of ten he will answer: \"No, not at all -- only a little\r\nqueer in the stomach.\" It is the same, in a slightly different way,\r\nwith snow-blindness. If a man comes into the tent in the evening with\r\nan inflamed eye and you ask him whether he is snow-blind, you may\r\nbe sure he will be almost offended. \"Snow-blind? Is it likely? No,\r\nnot at all, only a little queer about the eye.\"\r\n\r\nWe did seventeen miles[5] that day without exertion. We had two tents,\r\nand slept two in a tent. These tents were made for three men, but were\r\ntoo small for four. Cooking was only done in one, both for the sake\r\nof economy, so that we might leave more at the depot, and because it\r\nwas unnecessary, as the weather was still quite mild.\r\n\r\nOn this first trip, as on all the depot journeys, our morning\r\narrangements took far too long. We began to get ready at four, but\r\nwere not on the road till nearly eight. I was always trying some means\r\nof remedying this, but without success. It will naturally be asked,\r\nWhat could be the cause of this? and I will answer candidly -- it was\r\ndawdling and nothing else. On these depot journeys it did not matter so\r\nmuch, but on the main journey we had to banish dawdling relentlessly.\r\n\r\nNext day we did the allotted seventeen miles in six hours, and pitched\r\nour camp early in the afternoon. The dogs were rather tired, as it\r\nhad been uphill work all day. To-day, from a distance of twenty-eight\r\nmiles, we could look down into the Bay of Whales; this shows that we\r\nhad ascended considerably. We estimated our camp that evening to be 500\r\nfeet above the sea. We were astonished at this rise, but ought not to\r\nhave been so really, since we had already estimated this ridge at 500\r\nfeet when we first saw it from the end of the bay. But however it may\r\nbe, most of us have a strong propensity for setting up theories and\r\ninventing something new. What others have seen does not interest us,\r\nand on this occasion we took the opportunity -- I say we, because I\r\nwas one of them -- of propounding a new theory -- that of an evenly\r\nadvancing ice-slope from the Antarctic plateau. We saw ourselves in\r\nour mind's eye ascending gradually to the top, and thus avoiding a\r\nsteep and laborious climb among the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe day had been very warm, +12.2deg. F., and I had been obliged to\r\nthrow off everything except the most necessary underclothes. My\r\ncostume may be guessed from the name I gave to the ascent --\r\nSinglet Hill. There was a thick fog when we turned out next morning,\r\nexceedingly unpleasant. Here every inch was over virgin ground, and we\r\nhad to do it blindly. That day we had a feeling of going downhill. At\r\none o'clock land was reported right ahead. From the gesticulations\r\nof those in front I made out that it must be uncommonly big. I saw\r\nabsolutely nothing, but that was not very surprising. My sight is\r\nnot specially good, and the land did not exist.\r\n\r\nThe fog lifted, and the surface looked a little broken. The\r\nimaginary land lasted till the next day, when we found out that it\r\nhad only been a descending bank of fog. That day we put on the pace,\r\nand did twenty-five miles instead of our usual seventeen. We were\r\nvery lightly clad. There could be no question of skins; they were\r\nlaid aside at once. Very light wind-clothing was all we wore over\r\nour underclothes. On this journey most of us slept barelegged in\r\nthe sleeping-bags. Next day we were surprised by brilliantly clear\r\nweather and a dead calm. For the first time we had a good view. Towards\r\nthe south the Barrier seemed to continue, smooth and even, without\r\nascending. Towards the east, on the other hand, there was a marked\r\nrise -- presumably towards King Edward VII. Land, we thought then. In\r\nthe course of the afternoon we passed the first fissure we had met\r\nwith. It had apparently been filled up long ago. Our distance that\r\nday was twenty-three miles.\r\n\r\nOn these depot journeys we were always very glad of our Thermos\r\nflasks. In the middle of the day we made a halt, and took a cup of\r\nscalding hot chocolate, and it was very pleasant to be able to get one\r\nwithout any trouble in the middle of the snow plateau. On the final\r\nsouthern journey we did not take Thermos flasks. We had no lunch then.\r\n\r\nOn February 14, after a march of eleven and a half miles, we reached\r\n80deg. S. Unfortunately we did not succeed in getting any astronomical\r\nobservation on this trip, as the theodolite we had brought with us\r\nwent wrong, but later observations on several occasions gave 79deg.\r\n59' S. Not so bad in fog. We had marked out the route up to this\r\npoint with bamboo poles and flags at every 15 kilometres. Now, as\r\nwe had not fixed the position by astronomical observation, we found\r\nthat the flags would not be sufficient, and we had to look for some\r\nother means of marking the spot. A few empty cases were broken up and\r\ngave a certain number of marks, but not nearly enough. Then our eyes\r\nfell upon a bundle of dried fish lying on one of the sledges, and our\r\nmarking pegs were found. I should like to know whether any road has\r\nbeen marked out with dried fish before; I doubt it. Immediately on\r\nour arrival in lat. 80deg. -- at eleven in the morning -- we began to\r\nerect the depot. It was made quite solid, and was 12 feet high. The\r\ngoing here in 80deg. was quite different from what we had had all the\r\nrest of the way. Deep, loose snow every-where gave us the impression\r\nthat it must have fallen in perfectly still weather. Generally when\r\nwe passed by here -- but not always -- we found this loose snow.\r\n\r\nWhen the depot was finished and had been photographed, we threw\r\nourselves on the sledges and began the homeward journey. It was\r\nquite a treat to sit and be drawn along, a thing that otherwise\r\nnever happened. Prestrud sat with me. Hanssen drove first, but as\r\nhe now had the old track to follow, he wanted no one in front. On\r\nthe last sledge we had the marking pegs. Prestrud kept an eye on the\r\nsledge-meter, and sang out at every half-kilometre, while at the same\r\ntime I stuck a dried fish into the snow. This method of marking the\r\nroute proved a brilliant one. Not only did the dried fish show us the\r\nright way on several occasions, but they also came in very useful on\r\nthe next journey, when we returned with starving dogs. That day we\r\ncovered forty-three miles. We did not get to bed till one o'clock at\r\nnight, but this did not prevent our being up again at four and off\r\nat half-past seven. At half-past nine in the evening we drove into\r\nFramheim, after covering sixty-two miles that day. Our reason for\r\ndriving that distance was not to set up any record for the Barrier,\r\nbut to get home, if possible, before the Fram sailed, and thus have an\r\nopportunity of once more shaking hands with our comrades and wishing\r\nthem a good voyage. But as we came over the edge of the Barrier we\r\nsaw that, in spite of all our pains, we had come too late. The Fram\r\nwas not there. It gave us a strange and melancholy feeling, not easy\r\nto understand. But the next moment common sense returned, and our\r\njoy at her having got away from the Barrier undamaged after the long\r\nstay was soon uppermost. We heard that she had left the bay at noon\r\nthe same day -- just as we were spurting our hardest to reach her.\r\n\r\nThis depot journey was quite sufficient to tell us what the future\r\nhad in store. After this we were justified in seeing it in a rosy\r\nlight. We now had experience of the three important factors --\r\nthe lie of the ground, the going, and the means of traction --\r\nand the result was that nothing could be better. Everything was in\r\nthe most perfect order. I had always had a high opinion of the dog\r\nas a draught animal, but after this last performance my admiration\r\nfor these splendid animals rose to the pitch of enthusiasm. Let us\r\nlook at what my dogs accomplished on this occasion: On February 14\r\nthey went eleven miles southward with a load of 770 pounds, and on\r\nthe same day thirty-two miles northward -- only four of them, the\r\n\"Three Musketeers\" and Lassesen, as Fix and Snuppesen refused to do any\r\nwork. The weight they started with from 80deg.S. was that of the sledge,\r\n165 pounds; Prestrud, 176 pounds; and myself, 182 pounds. Add to this\r\n154 pounds for sleeping-bags, ski, and dried fish, and we have a total\r\nweight of 677 pounds, or about 170 pounds per dog. The last day they\r\ndid sixty-two miles. I think the dogs showed on this occasion that\r\nthey were well suited for sledging on the Barrier.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this brilliant result, we arrived at several other\r\nconclusions. In the first place, the question of the long time spent in\r\nour morning preparations thrust itself on our notice: this could not\r\nbe allowed to occur on the main journey. At least two hours might be\r\nsaved, I had no doubt of that -- but how? I should have to take time to\r\nthink it over. What required most alteration was our heavy outfit. The\r\nsledges were constructed with a view to the most difficult conditions\r\nof ground. The surface here was of the easiest kind, and consequently\r\npermitted the use of the lightest outfit. We ought to be able to reduce\r\nthe weight of the sledges by at least half -- possibly more. Our big\r\ncanvas ski-boots were found to need thorough alteration. They were too\r\nsmall and too stiff, and had to be made larger and softer. Foot-gear\r\nhad such an important bearing on the success of the whole expedition\r\nthat we had to do all that could be done to get it right.\r\n\r\nThe four who had stayed at home had accomplished a fine piece of\r\nwork. Framheim was hardly recognizable with the big new addition on\r\nits western wall. This pent-house was of the same width as the hut --\r\n13 feet -- and measured about 10 feet the other way. Windows had been\r\nput in -- two of them -- and it looked quite bright and pleasant when\r\none came in; but this was not to last for long. Our architects had\r\nalso dug a passage, 5 feet wide, round the whole hut, and this was now\r\ncovered over, simply by prolonging the sloping roof down to the snow\r\nto form a roof over this passage. On the side facing east a plank was\r\nfixed across the gable at the required height, and from this boards\r\nwere brought down to the snow. The lower part of this new extension\r\nof the roof was well strengthened, as the weight of snow that would\r\nprobably accumulate upon it in the course of the winter would be very\r\ngreat. This passage was connected with the pent-house by a side-door\r\nin the northern wall. The passage was constructed to serve as a place\r\nfor storing tinned foods and fresh meat, besides which its eastern end\r\nafforded an excellent place to get snow for melting. Here Lindstrom\r\ncould be sure of getting as much clean snow as he wanted, which was\r\nan impossibility outside the house. We had 120 dogs running about,\r\nand they were not particular as to the purpose for which we might want\r\nthe snow. But here in this snow wall Lindstrom had no need to fear the\r\ndogs. Another great advantage was that he would not have to go out in\r\nbad weather, darkness, and cold, every time he wanted a piece of ice.\r\n\r\nWe now had to turn our attention in the first place, before the cold\r\nweather set in, to the arrangement of our dog tents. We could not leave\r\nthem standing as they were on the snow; if we did so, we should soon\r\nfind that dogs' teeth are just as sharp as knives; besides which, they\r\nwould be draughty and cold for the animals. To counteract this, the\r\nfloor of each tent was sunk 6 feet below the surface of the Barrier. A\r\ngreat part of this excavation had to be done with axes, as we soon came\r\nto the bare ice. One of these dog tents, when finished, had quite an\r\nimportant appearance, when one stood at the bottom and looked up. It\r\nmeasured 18 feet from the floor to the peak of the tent, and the\r\ndiameter of the floor was 15 feet. Then twelve posts were driven into\r\nthe ice of the floor at equal intervals round the wall of the tent,\r\nand the dogs were tethered to them. From the very first day the dogs\r\ntook a liking to their quarters, and they were right, as they were well\r\noff there. I do not remember once seeing frost-rime on the coats of\r\nmy dogs down in the tent. They enjoyed every advantage there -- air,\r\nwithout draughts, light, and sufficient room. Round the tent-pole we\r\nleft a pillar of snow standing in the middle of the tent to the height\r\nof a man. It took us two days to put our eight dog tents in order.\r\n\r\nBefore the Fram sailed one of the whale-boats had been put ashore on\r\nthe Barrier. One never knew; if we found ourselves in want of a boat,\r\nit would be bad to have none, and if we did not have to use it, there\r\nwas no great harm done. It was brought up on two sledges drawn by\r\ntwelve dogs, and was taken some distance into the Barrier. The mast\r\nstood high in the air, and showed us its position clearly.\r\n\r\nBesides all their other work, the four men had found time for shooting\r\nseals while we were away, and large quantities of meat were now\r\nstowed everywhere. We had to lose no time in getting ready the tent\r\nin which we stored our chief supply of seal meat. It would not have\r\nlasted long if we had left it unprotected on the ground. To keep off\r\nthe dogs, we built a wall 7 feet high of large blocks of snow. The\r\ndogs themselves saw to its covering with ice, and for the time being\r\nall possibility of their reaching the meat was removed.\r\n\r\nWe did not let the floor grow old under our feet; it was time to be\r\noff again to the south with more food. Our departure was fixed for\r\nFebruary 22, and before that time we had a great deal to do. All the\r\nprovisions had first to be brought from the main depot and prepared\r\nfor the journey. Then we had to open the cases of pemmican, take\r\nout the boxes in which it was soldered, four rations in each, cut\r\nthese open, and put the four rations back in the case without the\r\ntin lining. By doing this we saved so much weight, and at the same\r\ntime avoided the trouble of having this work to do later on in the\r\ncold. The tin packing was used for the passage through the tropics,\r\nwhere I was afraid the pemmican might possibly melt and run into\r\nthe hold of the ship. This opening and repacking took a long time,\r\nbut we got through it. We used the pent-house as a packing-shed.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that took up a good deal of our time was our personal\r\noutfit. The question of boots was gone into thoroughly. Most of us were\r\nin favour of the big outer boots, but in a revised edition. There\r\nwere a few -- but extremely few -- who declared for nothing but\r\nsoft foot-gear. In this case it did not make so much difference,\r\nsince they all knew that the big boots would have to be brought on\r\nthe final journey on account of possible work on glaciers. Those,\r\ntherefore, who wanted to wear soft foot-gear, and hang their boots\r\non the sledge, might do so if they liked. I did not want to force\r\nanyone to wear boots he did not care for; it might lead to too much\r\nunpleasantness and responsibility. Everyone, therefore, might do as he\r\npleased. Personally I was in favour of boots with stiff soles, so long\r\nas the uppers could be made soft and sufficiently large to give room\r\nfor as many stockings as one wished to wear. It was a good thing the\r\nboot-maker could not look in upon us at Framheim just then -- and many\r\ntimes afterwards, for that matter. The knife was mercilessly applied\r\nto all his beautiful work, and all the canvas, plus a quantity of the\r\nsuperfluous leather, was cut away. As I had no great knowledge of the\r\nshoemaker's craft, I gladly accepted Wisting's offer to operate on\r\nmine. The boots were unrecognizable when I got them back from him. As\r\nregards shape, they were perhaps just as smart before the alteration,\r\nbut as that is a very unimportant matter in comparison with ease\r\nand comfort, I considered them improved by many degrees. The thick\r\ncanvas was torn off and replaced by thin weather-proof fabric. Big\r\nwedges were inserted in the toes, and allowed room for several more\r\npairs of stockings. Besides this, one of the many soles was removed,\r\nthus increasing the available space. It appeared to me that now I had\r\nfoot-gear that combined all the qualities I demanded -- stiff soles,\r\non which Huitfeldt-Hoyer Ellefsen ski-bindings could be used, and\r\notherwise soft, so that the foot was not pinched anywhere. In spite\r\nof all these alterations, my boots were once more in the hands of the\r\noperator before the main journey, but then they were made perfect. The\r\nboots of all the others underwent the same transformation, and every\r\nday our outfit became more complete. A number of minor alterations\r\nin our wardrobe were also carried out. One man was an enthusiast\r\nfor blinkers on his cap; another did not care for them. One put on\r\na nose-protector; another took his off; and if there was a question\r\nof which was right, each was prepared to defend his idea to the\r\nlast. These were all alterations of minor importance, but being due to\r\nindividual judgment, they helped to raise the spirits and increase\r\nself-confidence. Patents for braces also became the fashion. I\r\ninvented one myself, and was very proud of it for a time -- indeed,\r\nI had the satisfaction of seeing it adopted by one of my rivals. But\r\nthat rarely happened; each of us wanted to make his own inventions,\r\nand to be as original as possible. Any contrivance that resembled\r\nsomething already in use was no good. But we found, like the farmer,\r\nthat the old way often turned out to be the best.\r\n\r\nBy the evening of February 21 we were again ready to start. The sledges\r\n-- seven in number -- stood ready packed, and were quite imposing\r\nin appearance. Tempted by the favourable outcome of our former trip,\r\nwe put too much on our sledges this time -- on some of them, in any\r\ncase. Mine was overloaded. I had to suffer for it afterwards -- or,\r\nrather, my noble animals did.\r\n\r\nOn February 22, at 8.30 a.m., the caravan moved off -- eight men, seven\r\nsledges, and forty-two dogs -- and the most toilsome part of our whole\r\nexpedition began. As usual, we began well from Framheim. Lindstrom,\r\nwho was to stay at home alone and look after things, did not stand\r\nand wave farewells to us. Beaming with joy, he made for the hut as\r\nsoon as the last sledge was in motion. He was visibly relieved. But\r\nI knew very well that before long he would begin to take little turns\r\noutside to watch the ridge. Would they soon be coming?\r\n\r\nThere was a light breeze from the south, dead against us, and the sky\r\nwas overcast. Newly fallen snow made the going heavy, and the dogs had\r\nhard work with their loads. Our former tracks were no longer visible,\r\nbut we were lucky enough to find the first flag, which stood eleven\r\nmiles inland. From there we followed the dried fish, which stood out\r\nsharply against the white snow and were very easy to see. We pitched\r\nour camp at six o'clock in the evening, having come a distance\r\nof seventeen miles. Our camp was quite imposing -- four tents for\r\nthree men apiece, with two in each. In two of them the housekeeping\r\narrangements were carried on. The weather had improved during the\r\nafternoon, and by evening we had the most brilliantly clear sky.\r\n\r\nNext day the going was even heavier, and the dogs were severely\r\ntried. W e did no more than twelve and a half miles after eight hours'\r\nmarch. The temperature remained reasonable, +5deg. F. We had lost our\r\ndried fish, and for the last few hours were going only by compass.\r\n\r\nFebruary 24 began badly -- a strong wind from the south-east, with\r\nthick driving snow. We could see nothing, and had to steer our\r\ncourse by compass. It was bitter going against the wind, although\r\nthe temperature was no worse than -0.4deg. F. We went all day without\r\nseeing any mark. The snow stopped falling about noon, and at three\r\no'clock it cleared. As we were looking about for a place to pitch\r\nthe tents, we caught sight of one of our flags. When we reached it,\r\nwe found it was flag No. 5 -- all our bamboos were numbered, so we\r\nknew the exact position of the flag. No. 5 was forty-four and a half\r\nmiles from Framheim. This agreed well with the distance recorded --\r\nforty-four miles.\r\n\r\nThe next day was calm and clear, and the temperature began to\r\ndescend, -13deg. F. But in spite of this lower temperature the air\r\nfelt considerably milder, as it was quite still. We followed marks\r\nand fish the whole way, and at the end of our day's journey we had\r\ncovered eighteen miles -- a good distance for heavy going.\r\n\r\nWe then had a couple of days of bitter cold with fog, so that we did\r\nnot see much of our surroundings. We followed the fish and the marks\r\nmost of the way. We had already begun to find the fish useful as\r\nextra food; the dogs took it greedily. The forerunner had to take up\r\neach fish and throw it on one side; then one of the drivers went out,\r\ntook it up, and put it on his sledge. If the dogs had come upon the\r\nfish standing in the snow we should soon have had fierce fights. Even\r\nnow, before we reached the depot in 80deg. S., the dogs began to show\r\nsigns of exhaustion, probably as a result of the cold weather (-16.6deg.\r\nF.) and the hard work. They were stiff in the legs in the morning\r\nand difficult to set going.\r\n\r\nOn February 27, at 10.30 a.m., we reached the depot in 80deg. S. The\r\ndepot was standing as we had left it, and no snow-drifts had formed\r\nabout it, from which we concluded that the weather conditions had been\r\nquiet. The snow, which we had found very loose when we were there\r\nbefore, was now hardened by the cold. We were lucky with the sun,\r\nand got the position of the depot accurately determined.\r\n\r\nOn our way across these endless plains, where no landmarks of\r\nany kind are to be found, we had repeatedly thought of a means of\r\nmarking our depots so that we might be perfectly sure of finding\r\nthem again. Our fight for the Pole was entirely dependent on this\r\nautumn work, in laying down large supplies of provisions as far to\r\nthe south as possible in such a way that we could be certain of\r\nfinding them again. If we missed them, the battle would probably\r\nbe lost. As I have said, we had discussed the question thoroughly,\r\nand come to the conclusion that we should have to try to mark our\r\ndepots at right angles to the route, in an east and west direction,\r\ninstead of in a line with the route, north and south. These marks\r\nalong the line of the route may easily be missed in fog, if they\r\nare not close enough together; and if one thus gets out of the line,\r\nthere is a danger of not picking it up again. According to this new\r\narrangement we therefore marked this depot in 80deg. S. with high bamboo\r\npoles carrying black flags. We used twenty of these -- ten on each side\r\nof the depot. Between each two flags there was a distance of 984 yards\r\n(900 metres), so that the distance marked on each side of the depot\r\nwas five and a half miles (nine kilometres). Each bamboo was marked\r\nwith a number, so that we should always be able to tell from this\r\nnumber on which side the depot lay, and how far off. This method\r\nwas entirely new and untried, but proved afterwards to work with\r\nabsolute certainty. Our compasses and sledge-meters had, of course,\r\nbeen carefully adjusted at the station, and we knew that we could\r\nrely on them.\r\n\r\nHaving put this in order, we continued our journey on the following\r\nday. The temperature fell steadily as we went inland; if it continued\r\nin this way it would be cold before one got to the Pole. The surface\r\nremained as before -- flat and even. We ourselves had a feeling\r\nthat we were ascending, but, as the future will show, this was only\r\nimagination. We had had no trouble with fissures, and it almost looked\r\nas if we should avoid them altogether, since, of course, it might\r\nbe supposed that the part of the Barrier nearest the edge would be\r\nthe most fissured, and we had already left that behind us. South of\r\n80deg. we found the going easier, but the dogs were now beginning to\r\nbe stiff and sore-footed, and it was hard work to get them started\r\nin the morning. The sore feet I am speaking of here are not nearly\r\nso bad as those the dogs are liable to on the sea-ice of the Arctic\r\nregions. What caused sore feet on this journey was the stretches of\r\nsnow-crust we had to cross; it was not strong enough to bear the dogs,\r\nand they broke through and cut their paws. Sore feet were also caused\r\nby the snow caking and sticking between the toes. But the dog that has\r\nto travel on sea-ice in spring and summer is exposed to worse things --\r\nthe sharp ice cuts the paws and the salt gets in. To prevent this kind\r\nof sore feet one is almost obliged to put socks on the dogs. With the\r\nkind of foot-trouble our dogs experienced it is not necessary to take\r\nany such precautions. As a result of the long sea voyage their feet\r\nhad become unusually tender and could not stand much. On our spring\r\njourney we noticed no sore-footedness, in spite of the conditions\r\nbeing worse rather than better; probably their feet had got into\r\ncondition in the course of the winter.\r\n\r\nOn March 3 we reached 81deg. S. The temperature was then -45.4deg. F.,\r\nand it did not feel pleasant. The change had come too rapidly; this\r\ncould be seen both in men and in dogs. We pitched our camp at three\r\nin the afternoon, and went straight into the tents. The following\r\nday was employed in building and marking the depot. That night was\r\nthe coldest we observed on the trip, as the temperature was -49deg.\r\nF. when we turned out in the morning. If one compares the conditions\r\nof temperature in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, it will be seen\r\nthat this temperature is an exceptionally low one. The beginning of\r\nMarch corresponds, of course, to the beginning of September in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere -- a time of year when summer still prevails. We\r\nwere astonished to find this low temperature while summer ought still\r\nto have lasted, especially when I remembered the moderate temperatures\r\nShackleton had observed on his southern sledge journey. The idea at\r\nonce occurred to me of the existence of a local pole of maximum cold\r\nextending over the central portion of the Ross Barrier. A comparison\r\nwith the observations recorded at Captain Scott's station in McMurdo\r\nSound might to some extent explain this. In order to establish it\r\ncompletely one would require to have information about the conditions\r\nin King Edward Land as well. The observations Dr. Mawson is now engaged\r\nupon in Adelie Land and on the Barrier farther west will contribute\r\nmuch to the elucidation of this question.\r\n\r\nIn 81deg. S. we laid down a depot consisting of fourteen cases of dogs'\r\npemmican -- 1,234 pounds. For marking this depot we had no bamboo\r\npoles, so there was nothing to be done but to break up some cases\r\nand use the pieces as marks; this was, at any rate, better than\r\nnothing. Personally, I considered these pieces of wood, 2 feet high,\r\ngood enough, considering the amount of precipitation I had remarked\r\nsince our arrival in these regions. The precipitation we had observed\r\nwas very slight, considering the time of year -- spring and summer. If,\r\nthen, the snowfall was so inconsiderable at this time of the year\r\nand along the edge of the Barrier, what might it not be in autumn\r\nand winter in the interior? As I have said, something was better than\r\nnothing, and Bjaaland, Hassel, and Stubberud, who were to return to\r\nLindstrom's flesh-pots on the following day, were given the task of\r\nsetting up these marks. As with the former depot, this one was marked\r\nfor nine kilometres on each side from east to west. So that we might\r\nknow where the depot was, in case we should come upon one of these\r\nmarks in a fog, all those on the east were marked with a little cut\r\nof an axe. I must confess they looked insignificant, these little\r\nbits of wood that were soon lost to sight on the boundless plain,\r\nand the idea that they held the key of the castle where the fair one\r\nslept made me smile. They looked altogether too inconsiderable for\r\nsuch an honour. Meanwhile, we others, who were to go on to the south,\r\ntook it easy. The rest was good for the dogs especially, though the\r\ncold prevented their enjoying it as they should have done.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock next morning we parted company with the three who\r\nwent north. I had to send home one of my dogs, Odin, who had got an\r\nugly raw place -- I was using Greenland harness on him -- and I went\r\non with five dogs. These were very thin, and apparently worn out;\r\nbut in any case we had to reach 82deg. S. before we gave up. I had had\r\nsome hope that we might have got to 83deg., but it began to look as if\r\nwe had a poor chance of that. After 81deg. S. the Barrier began to take\r\non a slightly different appearance instead of the absolutely flat\r\nsurface, we saw on the first day a good many small formations of\r\nthe shape of haycocks. At that time we did not pay much attention\r\nto these apparently insignificant irregularities, but later on we\r\nlearned to keep our eyes open and our feet active when passing in\r\ntheir vicinity. On this first day southward from 81deg. S. we noticed\r\nnothing; the going was excellent, the temperature not so bad as it\r\nhad been, -27.4deg. F., and the distance covered very creditable. The\r\nnext day we got our first idea of the meaning of these little mounds,\r\nas the surface was cut up by crevasse after crevasse. These fissures\r\nwere not particularly wide, but were bottomless, as far as we could\r\nsee. About noon Hanssen's three leading dogs, Helge, Mylius, and Ring,\r\nfell into one of them, and remained hanging by their harness; and it\r\nwas lucky the traces held, as the loss of these three would have been\r\nseverely felt. When the rest of the team saw these three disappear,\r\nthey stopped short. Fortunately, they had a pronounced fear of these\r\nfissures, and always stopped when anything happened. We understood\r\nnow that the haycock formations were the result of pressure, and that\r\ncrevasses were always found in their neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThat day was for the most part thick and hazy, with a northerly wind,\r\nand snow-showers from time to time. Between the showers we caught\r\nsight of lofty -- very lofty -- pressure ridges, three or four of them,\r\nto the eastward. We estimated their distance at about six miles. Next\r\nday, March 7, we had the same experience that Shackleton mentions on\r\nseveral occasions. The morning began clear and fine, with a temperature\r\nof -40deg. F. In the course of the forenoon a breeze sprang up from\r\nthe south-east, and increased to a gale during the afternoon. The\r\ntemperature rose rapidly, and when we pitched our camp at three in\r\nthe afternoon it was only -0.4deg. F. At our camping-place that morning\r\nwe left a case of dogs' pemmican, for use on the homeward journey,\r\nand marked the way to the south with splinters of board at every\r\nkilometre. Our distance that day was only twelve and a half miles. Our\r\ndogs, especially mine, looked miserable -- terribly emaciated. It\r\nwas clear that they could only reach 82deg. S. at the farthest. Even\r\nthen the homeward journey would be a near thing.\r\n\r\nWe decided that evening to be satisfied with reaching 82deg., and then\r\nreturn. During this latter part of the trip we put up our two tents\r\nfront to front, so that the openings joined; in this way we were able\r\nto send the food direct from one tent to the other without going\r\noutside, and that was a great advantage. This circumstance led to\r\na radical alteration in our camping system, and gave us the idea\r\nof the best five-man tent that has probably yet been seen in the\r\nPolar regions. As we lay dozing that evening in our sleeping-bags,\r\nthinking of everything and nothing, the idea suddenly occurred to\r\nus that if the tents were sewed together as they now stood -- after\r\nthe fronts had been cut away -- we should get one tent that would\r\ngive us far more room for five than the two separate tents as they\r\nwere. The idea was followed up, and the fruit of it was the tent we\r\nused on the journey to the Pole -- an ideal tent in every way. Yes,\r\ncircumstances work wonders; for I suppose one need not make Providence\r\nresponsible for these trifles?\r\n\r\nOn March 8 we reached 82deg. S., and it was the utmost my five dogs could\r\nmanage. Indeed, as will shortly be seen, it was already too much. They\r\nwere completely worn out, poor beasts. This is the only dark memory of\r\nmy stay in the South -- the over-taxing of these fine animals -- I had\r\nasked more of them than they were capable of doing. My consolation is\r\nthat I did not spare myself either. To set this sledge, weighing nearly\r\nhalf a ton, in motion with tired-out dogs was no child's play. And\r\nsetting it in motion was not always the whole of it: sometimes one\r\nhad to push it forward until one forced the dogs to move. The whip had\r\nlong ago lost its terrors. When I tried to use it, they only crowded\r\ntogether, and got their heads as much out of the way as they could;\r\nthe body did not matter so much. Many a time, too, I failed altogether\r\nto get them to go, and had to have help. Then two of us shoved the\r\nsledge forward, while the third used the whip, shouting at the same\r\ntime for all he was worth. How hard and unfeeling one gets under such\r\nconditions; how one's whole nature may be changed! I am naturally fond\r\nof all animals, and try to avoid hurting them. There is none of the\r\n\"sportsman's\" instinct in me; it would never occur to me to kill an\r\nanimal -- rats and flies excepted -- unless it was to support life. I\r\nthink I can say that in normal circumstances I loved my dogs, and the\r\nfeeling was undoubtedly mutual. But the circumstances we were now in\r\nwere not normal -- or was it, perhaps, myself who was not normal? I\r\nhave often thought since that such was really the case. The daily hard\r\nwork and the object I would not give up had made me brutal, for brutal\r\nI was when I forced those five skeletons to haul that excessive load. I\r\nfeel it yet when I think of Thor -- a big, fine, smooth-haired dog --\r\nuttering his plaintive howls on the march, a thing one never hears\r\na dog do while working. I did not understand what it meant -- would\r\nnot understand, perhaps. On he had to go -- on till he dropped. When\r\nwe cut him open we found that his whole chest was one large abscess.\r\n\r\nThe altitude at noon gave us 81deg. 54' 30'',\r\nand we therefore went the other six miles to the south, and pitched\r\nour camp at 3.30 p.m. in 82deg. S. We had latterly had a constant\r\nimpression that the Barrier was rising, and in the opinion of all\r\nof us we ought now to have been at a height of about 1,500 feet and\r\na good way up the slope leading to the Pole. Personally I thought\r\nthe ground continued to rise to the south. It was all imagination,\r\nas our later measurements showed.\r\n\r\nWe had now reached our highest latitude that autumn, and had reason\r\nto be well satisfied. We laid down 1,370 pounds here, chiefly dogs'\r\npemmican. We did nothing that afternoon, only rested a little. The\r\nweather was brisk, clear and calm, -13deg. F. The distance this last\r\nday was thirteen and a half miles.\r\n\r\nNext day we stayed where we were, built our depot, and marked it. The\r\nmarking was done in the same way as in 81deg. S., with this difference,\r\nthat here the pieces of packing-case had small, dark blue strips\r\nof cloth fastened to the top, which made them easier to see. We\r\nmade this depot very secure, so that we could be certain it would\r\nstand bad weather in the course of the winter. I also left my sledge\r\nbehind, as I saw the impossibility of getting it home with my team;\r\nbesides which, an extra sledge at this point might possibly be useful\r\nlater. This depot -- 12 feet high -- was marked with a bamboo and a\r\nflag on the top, so that it could be seen a great way off.\r\n\r\nOn March 10 we took the road for home. I had divided my dogs between\r\nWisting and Hanssen, but they got no assistance from these bags of\r\nbones, only trouble. The other three teams had held out well. There\r\nwas hardly anything wrong to be seen with Hanssen's. Wisting's team\r\nwas looked upon as the strongest, but his dogs had got very thin;\r\nhowever, they did their work well. Wisting's sledge had also been\r\noverloaded; it was even heavier than mine. Johansen's animals had\r\noriginally been regarded as the weakest, but they proved themselves\r\nvery tough in the long-run. They were no racers, but always managed\r\nto scramble along somehow. Their motto was: \"If we don't get there\r\nto-day, we'll get there to-morrow.\" They all came home.\r\n\r\nOur original idea was that the homeward journey should be a sort of\r\npleasure trip, that we should sit on the sledges and take it easy;\r\nbut in the circumstances this was not to be thought of. The dogs had\r\nquite enough to do with the empty sledges. The same day we reached the\r\nplace where we had left a case of dogs' pemmican, and camped there,\r\nhaving done twenty-nine and three-quarter miles. The weather was cold\r\nand raw; temperature, -25.6deg. F. This weather took the last remnant of\r\nstrength out of my dogs; instead of resting at night, they lay huddled\r\ntogether and freezing. It was pitiful to see them. In the morning they\r\nhad to be lifted up and put on their feet; they had not strength enough\r\nto raise themselves. When they had staggered on a little way and got\r\nsome warmth into their bodies, they seemed to be rather better --\r\nat any rate, they could keep up with us. The following day we did\r\ntwenty-four and three-quarter miles; temperature, -32.8deg. F.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th we passed the depot in 81deg. S. The big pressure ridges\r\nto the east were easily visible, and we got a good bearing, which\r\nwould possibly come in useful later for fixing the position of\r\nthe depot. That day we did twenty-four and three-quarter miles;\r\ntemperature, -39deg. F. March 13 began calm and fine, but by half-past\r\nten in the morning a strong wind had sprung up from the east-south-east\r\nwith thick driving snow. So as not to lose the tracks we had followed\r\nso far, we pitched our camp, to wait till the storm was over. The wind\r\nhowled and took hold of the tents, but could not move them. The next\r\nday it blew just as hard from the same quarter, and we decided to\r\nwait. The temperature was as usual, with the wind in this quarter;\r\n-11.2deg. F. The wind did not moderate till 10.30 a.m. on the 15th,\r\nwhen we were able to make a start.\r\n\r\nWhat a sight there was outside! How were we going to begin to bring\r\norder out of this chaos? The sledges were completely snowed up;\r\nwhips, ski-bindings, and harness largely eaten up. It was a nice\r\npredicament. Fortunately we were well supplied with Alpine rope,\r\nand that did for the harness; spare straps came in for ski-bindings,\r\nbut the whips were not so easy to make good. Hanssen, who drove first,\r\nwas bound to have a fairly serviceable whip; the others did not matter\r\nso much, though it was rather awkward for them. In some way or other\r\nhe provided himself with a whip that answered his purpose. I saw one\r\nof the others armed with a tent-pole, and he used it till we reached\r\nFramheim. At first the dogs were much afraid of this monster of a whip,\r\nbut they soon found out that it was no easy matter to reach them with\r\nthe pole, and then they did not care a scrap for it.\r\n\r\nAt last everything seemed to be in order, and then we only had to get\r\nthe dogs up and in their places. Several of them were so indifferent\r\nthat they had allowed themselves to be completely snowed under,\r\nbut one by one we got them out and put them on their feet. Thor,\r\nhowever, refused absolutely. It was impossible to get him to stand\r\nup; he simply lay and whined. There was nothing to be done but to put\r\nan end to him, and as we had no firearms, it had to be done with an\r\naxe. It was quite successful; less would have killed him. Wisting took\r\nthe carcass on his sledge to take it to the next camp, and there cut it\r\nup. The day was bitterly cold -- fog and snow with a southerly breeze;\r\ntemperature, -14.8deg. F. We were lucky enough to pick up our old tracks\r\nof the southern journey, and could follow them. Lurven, Wisting's\r\nbest dog, fell down on the march, and died on the spot. He was one\r\nof those dogs who had to work their hardest the whole time; he never\r\nthought of shirking for a moment; he pulled and pulled until he died.\r\n\r\nAll sentimental feeling had vanished long ago; nobody thought of giving\r\nLurven the burial he deserved. What was left of him, skin and bones,\r\nwas cut up and divided among his companions.\r\n\r\nOn March 16 we advanced seventeen miles; temperature, -29.2deg. F. Jens,\r\none of my gallant \"Three Musketeers,\" had been given a ride all day\r\non Wisting's sledge; he was too weak to walk any longer. Thor was to\r\nhave been divided among his companions that evening, but, on account\r\nof the abscess in his chest, we changed our minds. He was put into an\r\nempty case and buried. During the night we were wakened by a fearful\r\nnoise. The dogs were engaged in a fierce fight, and it was easy to\r\nguess from their howls that it was all about food. Wisting, who always\r\nshowed himself quickest in getting out of the bag, was instantly on\r\nthe spot, and then it was seen that they had dug up Thor, and were\r\nnow feasting on him. It could not be said that they were hard to\r\nplease in the way of food. Associations of ideas are curious things;\r\n\"sauce hollandaise\" suddenly occurred to my mind. Wisting buried the\r\ncarcass again, and we had peace for the rest of the night.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th it felt bitterly cold, with -41.8deg. F., and a sharp\r\nsnowstorm from the south-east. Lassesen, one of my dogs, who had\r\nbeen following the sledges loose, was left behind this morning at\r\nthe camping-place; we did not miss him till late in the day. Rasmus,\r\none of the \"Three Musketeers,\" fell to-day. Like Lurven, he pulled\r\ntill he died. Jens was very ill, could not touch food, and was taken\r\non Wisting's sledge. We reached our depot in 80deg. S. that evening,\r\nand were able to give the dogs a double ration. The distance covered\r\nwas twenty-one and three-quarter miles. The surface about here had\r\nchanged in our absence; great, high snow-waves were now to be seen\r\nin all directions. On one of the cases in the depot Bjaaland had\r\nwritten a short message, besides which we found the signal arranged\r\nwith Hassel -- a block of snow on the top of the depot to show\r\nthat they had gone by, and that all was well. The cold continued\r\npersistently. The following day we had -41.8deg. F. Ola and Jens, the\r\ntwo survivors of the \"Three Musketeers,\" had to be put an end to that\r\nday; it was a shame to keep them alive any longer. And with them the\r\n\"Three Musketeers\" disappear from this history. They were inseparable\r\nfriends, these three; all of them almost entirely black. At Flekkero,\r\nnear Christiansand, where we kept our dogs for several weeks before\r\ntaking them on board, Rasmus had got loose, and was impossible to\r\ncatch. He always came and slept with his two friends, unless he was\r\nbeing hunted. We did not succeed in catching him until a few days\r\nbefore we took them on board, and then he was practically wild. They\r\nwere all three tied up on the bridge on board, where I was to have\r\nmy team, and from that day my closer acquaintance with the trio is\r\ndated. They were not very civilly disposed for the first month. I\r\nhad to make my advances with a long stick -- scratch them on the\r\nback. In this way I insinuated myself into their confidence, and we\r\nbecame very good friends. But they were a terrible power on board;\r\nwherever these three villains showed themselves, there was always a\r\nrow. They loved fighting. They were our fastest dogs. In our races\r\nwith empty sledges, when we were driving around Framheim, none of the\r\nothers could beat these three. I was always sure of leaving the rest\r\nbehind when I had them in my team.\r\n\r\nI had quite given up Lassesen, who had been left behind that morning,\r\nand I was very sorry for it, as he was my strongest and most willing\r\nbeast. I was glad, therefore, when he suddenly appeared again,\r\napparently fit and well. We presumed that he had dug up Thor again,\r\nand finished him. It must have been food that had revived him. From\r\n80deg. S. home he did remarkably good work in Wisting's team.\r\n\r\nThat day we had a curious experience, which was useful for the\r\nfuture. The compass on Hanssen's sledge, which had always been\r\nreliability itself, suddenly began to go wrong; at any rate, it did\r\nnot agree with the observations of the sun, which we fortunately had\r\nthat day. We altered our course in accordance with our bearings. In\r\nthe evening, when we took our things into the tent, the housewife,\r\nwith scissors, pins, needles, etc., had lain close against the\r\ncompass. No wonder it turned rebellious.\r\n\r\nOn March 19 we had a breeze from the south-east and -45.4deg. F. \"Rather\r\nfresh,\" I find noted in my diary. Not long after we had started that\r\nmorning, Hanssen caught sight of our old tracks. He had splendid\r\neyesight -- saw everything long before anyone else. Bjaaland also had\r\ngood sight, but he did not come up to Hanssen. The way home was now\r\nstraightforward, and we could see the end of our journey. Meanwhile\r\na gale sprang up from the south-east, which stopped us for a day;\r\ntemperature, -29.2deg. F. Next day the temperature had risen, as usual,\r\nwith a south-east wind; we woke up to find it +15.8deg. F. on the\r\nmorning of the 21st. That was a difference that could be felt, and\r\nnot an unpleasant one; we had had more than enough of -40deg.. It was\r\ncurious weather that night: violent gusts of wind from the east and\r\nsouth-east, with intervals of dead calm -- just as if they came off\r\nhigh land. On our way northward that day we passed our flag No. 6,\r\nand then knew that we were fifty-three miles from Framheim. Pitched\r\nour camp that evening at thirty-seven miles from the station. We\r\nhad intended to take this stretch of the way in two days, seeing\r\nhow tired the dogs were; but it turned out otherwise, for we lost\r\nour old tracks during the forenoon, and in going on we came too far\r\nto the east, and high up on the ridge mentioned before. Suddenly\r\nHanssen sang out that he saw something funny in front -- what it\r\nwas he did not know. When that was the case, we had to apply to the\r\none who saw even better than Hanssen, and that was my glass. Up with\r\nthe glass, then -- the good old glass that has served me for so many\r\nyears. Yes, there was certainly something curious. It must be the\r\nBay of Whales that we were looking down into, but what were those\r\nblack things moving up and down? They are our fellows hunting seals,\r\nsomeone suggested, and we all agreed. Yes, of course, it was so clear\r\nthat there was no mistaking it. \"I can see a sledge -- and there's\r\nanother -- and there's a third.\" We nearly had tears in our eyes to\r\nsee how industrious they were. \"Now they're gone. No; there they are\r\nagain. Strange how they bob up and down, those fellows!\" It proved to\r\nbe a mirage; what we saw was Framheim with all its tents. Our lads,\r\nwe were sure, were just taking a comfortable midday nap, and the\r\ntears we were nearly shedding were withdrawn. Now we could survey\r\nthe situation calmly. There lay Framheim, there was Cape Man's Head,\r\nand there West Cape, so that we had come too far to the east. \"Hurrah\r\nfor Framheim! half-past seven this evening,\" shouted one. \"Yes, that's\r\nall we can do,\" cried another; and away we went. We set our course\r\nstraight for the middle of the bay. We must have got pretty high up,\r\nas we went down at a terrific pace. This was more than the forerunner\r\ncould manage; he flung himself on a sledge as it went by. I had a\r\nglimpse of Hanssen, who was busy making a whip-handle, as I passed;\r\nthe soles of his feet were then very prominent. I myself was lying\r\non Hanssen's sledge, shaking with laughter; the situation was too\r\ncomical. Hanssen picked himself up again just as the last sledge was\r\npassing and jumped on. We all collected in a mass below the ridge --\r\nsledges and dogs mixed up together.\r\n\r\nThe last part of the way was rather hard work. We now found the\r\ntracks that we had lost early in the day; one dried fish after\r\nanother stuck up out of the snow and led us straight on. We reached\r\nFramheim at seven in the evening, half an hour earlier than we had\r\nthought. It was a day's march of thirty-seven miles -- not so bad\r\nfor exhausted dogs. Lassesen was the only one I brought home out of\r\nmy team. Odin, whom I had sent home from 81deg. S., died after arriving\r\nthere. We lost altogether eight dogs on this trip; two of Stubberud's\r\ndied immediately after coming home from 81deg. S. Probably the cold was\r\nchiefly responsible; I feel sure that with a reasonable temperature\r\nthey would have come through. The three men who came home from 81deg.\r\nS. were safe and sound. It is true that they had run short of food\r\nand matches the last day, but if the worst came to the worst, they\r\nhad the dogs. Since their return they had shot, brought in, cut up,\r\nand stowed away, fifty seals -- a very good piece of work.\r\n\r\nLindstrom had been untiring during our absence; he had put everything\r\nin splendid order. In the covered passage round the hut he had cut out\r\nshelves in the snow and filled them with slices of seal meat. Here\r\nalone there were steaks enough for the whole time we should spend\r\nhere. On the outer walls of the hut, which formed the other side of\r\nthe passage, he had put up shelves, and there all kinds of tinned\r\nfoods were stored. All was in such perfect order that one could put\r\none's hand on what one wanted in the dark. There stood salt meat\r\nand bacon by themselves, and there were fish-cakes. There you read\r\nthe label on a tin of caramel pudding, and you could be sure that\r\nthe rest of the caramel puddings were in the vicinity. Quite right;\r\nthere they stood in a row, like a company of soldiers. Oh, Lindstrom,\r\nhow long will this order last?\r\n\r\nWell, that was, of course, a question I put to myself in the strictest\r\nsecrecy. Let me turn over my diary. On Thursday, July 27, I find the\r\nfollowing entry: \"The provision passage turns our days into chaotic\r\nconfusion. How my mind goes back to the time when one could find\r\nwhat one wanted without a light of any kind! If you put out your hand\r\nto get a plum-pudding and shut it again, you could be sure it was a\r\nplum-pudding you had hold of. And so it was throughout Lindstrom's\r\ndepartment. But now -- good Heavens! I am ashamed to put down what\r\nhappened to me yesterday. I went out there in the most blissful\r\nignorance of the state of things now prevailing, and, of course,\r\nI had no light with me, for everything had its place. I put out my\r\nhand and grasped. According to my expectation I ought to have been in\r\npossession of a packet of candles, but the experiment had failed. That\r\nwhich I held in my hand could not possibly be a packet of candles. It\r\nwas evident from the feel that it was something of a woollen nature. I\r\nlaid the object down, and had recourse to the familiar expedient\r\nof striking a match. Do you know what it was? A dirty old -- pair\r\nof pants! and do you want to know where I found it? Well, it was\r\nbetween the butter and the sweetmeats. That was mixing things up\r\nwith a vengeance.\" But Lindstrom must not have all the blame. In this\r\npassage everyone was running backwards and forwards, early and late,\r\nand as a rule in the dark. And if they knocked something down on the\r\nway, I am not quite sure that they always stopped to pick it up again.\r\n\r\nThen he had painted the ceiling of the room white. How cosy it\r\nlooked when we put our heads in that evening! He had seen us a long\r\nway off on the Barrier, the rascal, and now the table was laid with\r\nall manner of dainties. But seal-steaks and the smell of coffee were\r\nwhat attracted us, and it was no small quantity that disappeared that\r\nevening. Home! -- that word has a good sound, wherever it may be, at\r\nsea, on land, or on -- the Barrier. How comfortable we made ourselves\r\nthat night! The first thing we did now was to dry all our reindeer-skin\r\nclothes; they were wet through. This was not to be done in a hurry. We\r\nhad to stretch the garments that were to be dried on lines under the\r\nceiling of the room, so that we could not dry very much at a time.\r\n\r\nWe got everything ready, and made some improvements in our outfit\r\nfor a last depot journey before the winter set in. This time the\r\ndestination was 80deg. S., with about a ton and a quarter of fresh seal\r\nmeat. How immensely important it would be on the main journey if we\r\ncould give our dogs as much seal meat as they could eat at 80deg. S.;\r\nwe all saw the importance of this, and were eager to carry it out. We\r\nset to work once more at the outfit; the last trip had taught us much\r\nthat was new. Thus Prestrud and Johansen had come to the conclusion\r\nthat a double sleeping-bag was preferable to two single ones. I will\r\nnot enter upon the discussion that naturally arose on this point. The\r\ndouble bag has many advantages, and so has the single bag; let it\r\ntherefore remain a matter of taste. Those two were, however, the only\r\nones who made this alteration. Hanssen and Wisting were busy carrying\r\nout the new idea for the tents, and it was not long before they had\r\nfinished. These tents are as much like a snow hut in form as they can\r\nbe; instead of being entirely round, they have a more oblong form,\r\nbut there is no flat side, and the wind has no point of attack. Our\r\npersonal outfit also underwent some improvements.\r\n\r\nThe Bay of Whales -- the inner part of it, from Man's Head to West\r\nCape -- was now entirely frozen over, but outside the sea lay immense\r\nand dark. Our house was now completely covered with snow. Most of\r\nthis was Lindstrom's work; the blizzard had not helped him much. This\r\ncovering with snow has a great deal to do with keeping the hut snug\r\nand warm. Our dogs -- 107 in number -- mostly look like pigs getting\r\nready for Christmas; even the famished ones that made the last trip\r\nare beginning to recover. It is an extraordinary thing how quickly\r\nsuch an animal can put on flesh.\r\n\r\nIt was interesting to watch the home-coming of the dogs from the\r\nlast trip. They showed no sign of surprise when we came into camp;\r\nthey might have been there all the time. It is true they were rather\r\nmore hungry than the rest. The meeting between Lassesen and Fix was\r\ncomic. These two were inseparable friends; the first-named was boss,\r\nand the other obeyed him blindly. On this last trip I had left Fix at\r\nhome, as he did not give me the impression of being quite up to the\r\nwork; he had therefore put on a lot of flesh, big eater as he was. I\r\nstood and watched their meeting with intense curiosity. Would not Fix\r\ntake advantage of the occasion to assume the position of boss? In such\r\na mass of dogs it took some little time before they came across each\r\nother. Then it was quite touching. Fix ran straight up to the other,\r\nbegan to lick him, and showed every sign of the greatest affection\r\nand joy at seeing him again. Lassesen, on his part, took it all with\r\na very superior air, as befits a boss. Without further ceremony, he\r\nrolled his fat friend in the snow and stood over him for a while --\r\nno doubt to let him know that he was still absolute master, beyond\r\ndispute. Poor Fix! -- he looked quite crestfallen. But this did not\r\nlast long; he soon avenged himself on the other, knowing that he\r\ncould tackle him with safety.\r\n\r\nIn order to give a picture of our life as it was at this time, I\r\nwill quote a day from my diary. March 25 -- Saturday: \"Beautiful mild\r\nweather, +6.8deg. F. all day. Very light breeze from the south-east. Our\r\nseal-hunters -- the party that came home from 81deg. S. -- were out this\r\nmorning, and brought back three seals. This makes sixty-two seals\r\naltogether since their return on March 11. We have now quite enough\r\nfresh meat both for ourselves and for all our dogs. We get to like\r\nseal-steak more and more every day. We should all be glad to eat it\r\nat every meal, but we think it safer to make a little variety. For\r\nbreakfast -- eight o'clock -- we now have regularly hot cakes with\r\njam, and Lindstrom knows how to prepare them in a way that could not\r\nbe surpassed in the best American houses. In addition, we have bread,\r\nbutter, cheese, and coffee. For dinner we mostly have seal meat (we\r\nintroduced rather more tinned meat into the menu in the course of the\r\nwinter), and sweets in the form of tinned Californian fruit, tarts,\r\nand tinned puddings. For supper, seal-steak, with whortleberry jam,\r\ncheese, bread, butter, and coffee. Every Saturday evening a glass of\r\ntoddy and a cigar. I must frankly confess that I have never lived so\r\nwell. And the consequence is that we are all in the best of health, and\r\nI feel certain that the whole enterprise will be crowned with success.\r\n\r\n\"It is strange indeed here to go outside in the evening and see the\r\ncosy, warm lamp-light through the window of our little snow-covered\r\nhut, and to feel that this is our snug, comfortable home on the\r\nformidable and dreaded Barrier. All our little puppies -- as round\r\nas Christmas pigs -- are wandering about outside, and at night they\r\nlie in crowds about the door. They never take shelter under a roof\r\nat night. They must be hardy beasts. Some of them are so fat that\r\nthey waddle just like geese.\"\r\n\r\nThe aurora australis was seen for the first time on the evening of\r\nMarch 28. It was composed of shafts and bands, and extended from the\r\nsouth-west to the north-east through the zenith. The light was pale\r\ngreen and red. We see many fine sunsets here, unique in the splendour\r\nof their colour. No doubt the surroundings in this fairyland of blue\r\nand white do much to increase their beauty.\r\n\r\nThe departure of the last depot journey was fixed for Friday, March\r\n31. A few days before, the seal-hunting party went out on the ice and\r\nshot six seals for the depot. They were cleaned and all superfluous\r\nparts removed, so that they should not be too heavy. The weight of\r\nthese six seals was then estimated at about 2,400 pounds.\r\n\r\nOn March 31, at 10 a.m., the last depot party started. It consisted\r\nof seven men, six sledges, and thirty-six dogs. I did not go myself\r\nthis time. They had the most beautiful weather to begin their journey\r\n-- dead calm and brilliantly clear. At seven o'clock that morning,\r\nwhen I came out of the hut, I saw a sight so beautiful that I shall\r\nnever forget it. The whole surroundings of the station lay in deep,\r\ndark shadow, in lee of the ridge to the east. But the sun's rays\r\nreached over the Barrier farther to the north, and there the Barrier\r\nlay golden red, bathed in the morning sun. It glittered and shone,\r\nred and gold, against the jagged row of mighty masses of ice that\r\nbounds our Barrier on the north. A spirit of peace breathed over\r\nall. But from Framheim the smoke ascended quietly into the air,\r\nand proclaimed that the spell of thousands of years was broken.\r\n\r\nThe sledges were heavily loaded when they went southward. I saw them\r\nslowly disappear over the ridge by the starting-place. It was a quiet\r\ntime that followed after all the work and hurry of preparation. Not\r\nthat we two who stayed at home sat still doing nothing. We made\r\ngood use of the time. The first thing to be done was to put our\r\nmeteorological station in order. On April 1 all the instruments\r\nwere in use. In the kitchen were hung our two mercury barometers,\r\nfour aneroids, barograph, thermograph, and one thermometer. They were\r\nplaced in a well-protected corner, farthest from the stove. We had\r\nno house as yet for our outside instruments, but the sub-director\r\nwent to work to prepare one as quickly as possible, and so nimble\r\nwere his hands that when the depot party returned there was the\r\nfinest instrument-screen standing ready on the hill, painted white\r\nso that it shone a long way off: The wind-vane was a work of art,\r\nconstructed by our able engineer, Sundbeck. No factory could have\r\nsupplied a more handsome or tasteful one. In the instrument-screen we\r\nhad a thermograph, hygrometer, and thermometers. Observations were\r\nmade at 8 a.m., 2 p.m., and 8 p.m. When I was at home I took them,\r\nand when I was away it was Lindstrom's work.\r\n\r\nOn the night before April 11 something or other fell down in the\r\nkitchen -- according to Lindstrom, a sure sign that the travellers\r\nmight be expected home that day. And, sure enough, at noon we caught\r\nsight of them up at the starting-place. They came across at such a\r\npace that the snow was scattered all round them, and in an hour's\r\ntime we had them back. They had much to tell us. In the first place,\r\nthat everything had been duly taken to the depot in 80deg.S. Then they\r\nsurprised me with an account of a fearfully crevassed piece of\r\nsurface that they had come upon, forty-six and a half miles from\r\nthe station, where they had lost two dogs. This was very strange;\r\nwe had now traversed this stretch of surface four times without being\r\nparticularly troubled with anything of this sort, and then, all of a\r\nsudden, when they thought the whole surface was as solid as a rock,\r\nthey found themselves in danger of coming to grief altogether. In\r\nthick weather they had gone too far to the west; then, instead of\r\narriving at the ridge, as we had done before, they came down into the\r\nvalley, and there found a surface so dangerous that they nearly had\r\na catastrophe. It was a precisely similar piece of surface to that\r\nalready mentioned to the south of 81deg. S., but full of small hummocks\r\neverywhere. The ground was apparently solid enough, and this was just\r\nthe most dangerous thing about it; but, as they were crossing it,\r\nlarge pieces of the surface fell away just in rear of them, disclosing\r\nbottomless crevasses, big enough to swallow up everything -- men, dogs,\r\nand sledges. With some difficulty they got out of this ugly place by\r\nsteering to the east. Now we knew of it, and we should certainly be\r\nvery careful not to come that way again. In spite of this, however,\r\nwe afterwards had an even more serious encounter with this nasty trap.\r\n\r\nOne dog had also been left behind on the way; it had a wound on one\r\nof its feet, and could not be harnessed in the sledge. It had been\r\nlet loose a few miles to the north of the depot, doubtless with the\r\nidea that it would follow the sledges. But the dog seemed to have\r\ntaken another view of the matter, and was never seen again. There\r\nwere some who thought that the dog had probably returned to the depot,\r\nand was now passing its days in ease and luxury among the laboriously\r\ntransported seals' carcasses. I must confess that this idea was not\r\nvery attractive to me; there was, indeed, a possibility that such a\r\nthing had happened, and that the greater part of our seal meat might\r\nbe missing when we wanted it. But our fears proved groundless; Cook --\r\nthat was the name of the dog; we had a Peary as well, of course --\r\nwas gone for ever.\r\n\r\nThe improved outfit was in every way successful. Praises of the new\r\ntent were heard on every hand, and Prestrud and Johansen were in the\r\nseventh heaven over their double sleeping-bag. I fancy the others\r\nwere very well satisfied with their single ones.\r\n\r\nAnd with this the most important part of the autumn's work came to an\r\nend. The foundation was solidly laid; now we had only to raise the\r\nedifice. Let us briefly sum up the work accomplished between January\r\n14 and April 11: The complete erection of the station, with\r\naccommodation for nine men for several years; provision of fresh meat\r\nfor nine men and a hundred and fifteen dogs for half a year -- the\r\nweight of the seals killed amounted to about 60 tons; and, finally,\r\nthe distribution of 3 tons of supplies in the depots in latitudes\r\n80deg., 81deg., and 82deg.S. The depot in 80deg.S. contained seal\r\nmeat, dogs' pemmican, biscuits, butter, milk-powder, chocolate,\r\nmatches, and paraffin, besides a quantity of outfit. The total weight\r\nof this depot was 4,200 pounds. In 81deg.S., 1/2 ton of dogs'\r\npemmican. In 82deg.S., pemmican, both for men and dogs, biscuits,\r\nmilk-powder, chocolate, and paraffin, besides a quantity of\r\noutfit. The weight of this depot amounted to 1,366 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPreparing for Winter\r\n\r\nWinter! I believe most people look upon winter as a time of storms,\r\ncold, and discomfort. They look forward to it with sadness, and bow\r\nbefore the inevitable -- Providence ordains it so. The prospect of a\r\nball or two cheers them up a little, and makes the horizon somewhat\r\nbrighter; but, all the same -- darkness and cold -- ugh, no! let us\r\nhave summer, they say. What my comrades thought about the winter\r\nthat was approaching I cannot say; for my part, I looked forward\r\nto it with pleasure. When I stood out there on the snow hill, and\r\nsaw the light shining out of the kitchen window, there came over me\r\nan indescribable feeling of comfort and well-being. And the blacker\r\nand more stormy the winter night might be, the greater would be this\r\nfeeling of well-being inside our snug little house. I see the reader's\r\nquestioning look, and know what he will say: \"But weren't you awfully\r\nafraid the Barrier would break off, and float you out to sea?\" I will\r\nanswer this question as frankly as possible. With one exception, we\r\nwere all at this time of the opinion that the part of the Barrier on\r\nwhich the hut stood rested on land, so that any fear of a sea voyage\r\nwas quite superfluous. As to the one who thought we were afloat, I\r\nthink I can say very definitely that he was not afraid. I believe,\r\nas a matter of fact, that he gradually came round to the same view\r\nas the rest of us.\r\n\r\nIf a general is to win a battle, he must always be prepared. If\r\nhis opponent makes a move, he must see that he is able to make a\r\ncounter-move; everything must be planned in advance, and nothing\r\nunforeseen. We were in the same position; we had to consider beforehand\r\nwhat the future might bring, and make our arrangements accordingly\r\nwhile there was time. When the sun had left us, and the dark period\r\nhad set in, it would be too late. What first of all claimed our\r\nattention and set our collective brain-machinery to work was the female\r\nsex. There was no peace for us even on the Barrier. What happened\r\nwas that the entire feminine population -- eleven in number -- had\r\nthought fit to appear in a condition usually considered \"interesting,\"\r\nbut which, under the circumstances, we by no means regarded in that\r\nlight. Our hands were indeed full enough without this. What was to be\r\ndone? Great deliberation. Eleven maternity hospitals seemed rather a\r\nlarge order, but we knew by experience that they all required first\r\naid. If we left several of them in the same place there would be a\r\nterrible scene, and it would end in their eating up each other's\r\npups. For what had happened only a few days before? Kaisa, a big\r\nblack-and-white bitch, had taken a three-months-old pup when no one\r\nwas looking, and made a meal off it. When we arrived we saw the tip\r\nof its tail disappearing, so there was not much to be done. Now,\r\nit fortunately happened that one of the dog-tents became vacant, as\r\nPrestrud's team was divided among the other tents; as \"forerunner,\"\r\nhe had no use for dogs. Here, with a little contrivance, we could\r\nget two of them disposed of; a dividing wall could be put up. When\r\nfirst laying out the station, we had taken this side of life into\r\nconsideration, and a \"hospital\" in the shape of a sixteen-man tent\r\nhad been erected; but this was not nearly enough. We then had recourse\r\nto the material of which there is such superabundance in these parts\r\nof the earth-snow. We erected a splendid big snow-hut. Besides this,\r\nLindstrom in his leisure hours had erected a little building, which was\r\nready when we returned from the second depot journey. We had none of\r\nus asked what it was for, but now we knew Lindstrom's kind heart. With\r\nthese arrangements at our disposal we were able to face the winter.\r\n\r\nCamilla, the sly old fox, had taken things in time; she knew what\r\nit meant to bring up children in the dark, and, in truth, it was\r\nno pleasure. She had therefore made haste, and was ready as soon as\r\nthe original \"hospital\" was prepared. She could now look forward to\r\nthe future with calmness in the last rays of the disappearing sun;\r\nwhen darkness set in, her young ones would be able to look after\r\nthemselves. Camilla, by the way, had her own views of bringing up\r\nher children. What there was about the hospital that she did not\r\nlike I do not know, but it is certain that she preferred any other\r\nplace. It was no rare thing to come across Camilla in a tearing gale\r\nand a temperature twenty below zero with one of her offspring in her\r\nmouth. She was going out to look for a new place. Meanwhile, the three\r\nothers, who had to wait, were shrieking and howling. The places she\r\nchose were not, as a rule, such as we should connect with the idea of\r\ncomfort; a case, for instance, standing on its side, and fully exposed\r\nto the wind, or behind a stack of planks, with a draught coming through\r\nthat would have done credit to a factory chimney. But if she liked it,\r\nthere was nothing to be said. If the family were left alone in such\r\na place, she would spend some days there before moving on again. She\r\nnever returned to the hospital voluntarily, but it was not a rare thing\r\nto see Johansen, who was guardian to the family, hauling off the lady\r\nand as many of her little ones as he could get hold of in a hurry. They\r\nthen disappeared into the hospital with words of encouragement.\r\n\r\nAt the same time we introduced a new order of things with our\r\ndogs. Hitherto we had been obliged to keep them tied up on account of\r\nseal-hunting; otherwise they went off by themselves and ravaged. There\r\nwere certain individuals who specially distinguished themselves in\r\nthis way, like Wisting's Major. He was a born hunter, afraid of\r\nnothing. Then there was Hassel's Svarten; but a good point about\r\nhim was that he went off alone, while the Major always had a whole\r\nstaff with him. They usually came back with their faces all covered\r\nwith blood. To put a stop to this sport we had been obliged to keep\r\nthem fast; but now that the seals had left us, we could let them\r\nloose. Naturally the first use to which they put their liberty was\r\nfighting. In the course of time -- for reasons impossible to discover\r\n-- bitter feelings and hatred had arisen between certain of the dogs,\r\nand now they were offered an opportunity of deciding which was the\r\nstronger, and they seized upon it with avidity. But after a time their\r\nmanners improved, and a regular fight became a rarity. There were,\r\nof course, a few who could never see each other without flying at one\r\nanother's throats, like Lassesen and Hans, for instance; but we knew\r\ntheir ways, and could keep an eye on them. The dogs soon knew their\r\nrespective tents, and their places in them. They were let loose as\r\nsoon as we came out in the morning, and were chained up again in the\r\nevening when they were to be fed. They got so used to this that we\r\nnever had much trouble; they all reported themselves cheerfully when\r\nwe came in the evening to fasten them up, and every animal knew his\r\nown master and tent, and knew at once what was expected of him. With\r\nhowls of delight the various dogs collected about their masters, and\r\nmade for the tents in great jubilation. We kept up this arrangement\r\nthe whole time. Their food consisted of seal's flesh and blubber one\r\nday, and dried fish the next; as a rule, both disappeared without any\r\nobjection, though they certainly preferred the seal. Throughout the\r\ngreater part of the winter we had carcasses of seals lying on the\r\nslope, and these were usually a centre of great interest. The spot\r\nmight be regarded as the market-place of Framheim, and it was not\r\nalways a peaceful one. The customers were many and the demand great,\r\nso that sometimes lively scenes took place. Our own store of seal's\r\nflesh was in the \"meat-tent.\" About a hundred seals had been cut up and\r\nstacked there. As already mentioned, we built a wall of snow, two yards\r\nhigh, round this tent, as a protection against the dogs. Although they\r\nhad as much to eat as they wanted, and although they knew they were not\r\nallowed to try to get in -- or possibly this prohibition was just the\r\nincentive -- they were always casting longing eyes in that direction,\r\nand the number of claw-marks in the wall spoke eloquently of what went\r\non when we were not looking. Snuppesen, in particular, could not keep\r\nherself away from that wall, and she was extremely light and agile,\r\nso that she had the best chance. She never engaged in this sport by\r\nherself, but always enticed out her attendant cavaliers, Fix and Lasse;\r\nthese, however, were less active, and had to be content with looking\r\non. While she jumped inside the wall -- which she only succeeded in\r\ndoing once or twice -- they ran round yelling. As soon as we heard\r\ntheir howls, we knew exactly what was happening, and one of us went\r\nout, armed with a stick. It required some cunning to catch her in the\r\nact, for as soon as one approached, her cavaliers stopped howling, and\r\nshe understood that something was wrong. Her red fox's head could then\r\nbe seen over the top, looking round. It need scarcely be said that she\r\ndid not jump into the arms of the man with the stick, but, as a rule,\r\nhe did not give up until he had caught and punished her. Fix and Lasse\r\nalso had their turns; it was true they had done nothing wrong, but\r\nthey might. They knew this, and watched Snuppesen's chastisement at\r\na distance. The tent where we kept the dried fish stood always open;\r\nnone of them attempted to take fish.\r\n\r\nThe sun continued its daily course, lower and lower. We did not see\r\nmuch of it after the return from the last depot journey; on April\r\n11 it came, and vanished again at once. Easter came round on the\r\nBarrier, as in other parts of the globe, and had to be kept. Holidays\r\nwith us were marked by eating a little more than usual; there was no\r\nother sign. We did not dress differently, nor did we introduce any\r\nother change. In the evening of a holiday we generally had a little\r\ngramophone, a glass of toddy, and a cigar; but we were careful with\r\nthe gramophone. We knew we should soon get tired of it if we used\r\nit too often; therefore we only brought it out on rare occasions,\r\nbut we enjoyed its music all the more when we heard it. When Easter\r\nwas over, a sigh of relief escaped us all; these holidays are always\r\ntiring. They are tedious enough in places which have more amusements\r\nto offer than the Barrier, but here they were insufferably long.\r\n\r\nOur manner of life was now completely in order, and everything worked\r\neasily and well. The chief work of the winter would be the perfecting\r\nof our outfit for the coming sledge journey to the South. Our\r\nobject was to reach the Pole -- everything else was secondary. The\r\nmeteorological observations were in full swing and arranged for\r\nthe winter. Observations were made at 8 a.m., 2 p.m., and 8 p.m. We\r\nwere so short-handed that I could not spare anyone for night duty,\r\nbesides which, living as we did in a small space, it would have a\r\ndisturbing effect if there were always someone moving about; there\r\nwould never be any peace. My special aim was that everyone should\r\nbe happy and comfortable, so that, when the spring came, we might\r\nall be fresh and well and eager to take up the final task. It was\r\nnot my intention that we should spend the winter in idleness -- far\r\nfrom it. To be contented and well, a man must always be occupied. I\r\ntherefore expected everyone to be busy during the hours that were set\r\napart for work. At the end of the day each man was free to do what\r\nhe pleased. We had also to keep some sort of order and tidiness, as\r\nwell as circumstances permitted. It was therefore decided that each\r\nof us should take a week's duty as \"orderly.\" This duty consisted\r\nin sweeping the floor every morning, emptying ash-trays, etc. To\r\nsecure plenty of ventilation -- especially in our sleeping-places --\r\na rule was made that no one might have anything under his bunk except\r\nthe boots he had in wear. Each man had two pegs to hang his clothes\r\non, and this was sufficient for what he was wearing every day; all\r\nsuperfluous clothing was stuffed into our kit-bags and put out. In\r\nthis way we succeeded in maintaining some sort of tidiness; in any\r\ncase, the worst of the dirt was got rid of. Whether a fastidious\r\nhousekeeper would have found everything in order is doubtful.\r\n\r\nEveryone had his regular work. Prestrud, with the assistance\r\nof Johansen, looked after the astronomical observations and the\r\npendulum observations. Hassel was set in authority over coal, wood,\r\nand paraffin; he was responsible for the supply lasting out. As manager\r\nof the Framheim coal and wood business, he, of course, received the\r\ntitle of Director, and this dignity might possibly have gone to his\r\nhead if the occupation of errand-boy had not been combined with it. But\r\nit was. Besides receiving the orders, he had to deliver the goods, and\r\nhe discharged his duties with distinction. He succeeded in hoodwinking\r\nhis largest customer -- Lindstrom -- to such an extent that, in the\r\ncourse of the winter, he saved a good deal of coal. Hanssen had to\r\nkeep the depot in order and bring in everything we required. Wisting\r\nhad charge of the whole outfit, and was responsible that nothing was\r\ntouched without permission. Bjaaland and Stubberud were to look after\r\nthe pent-house and the passage round the hut. Lindstrom was occupied in\r\nthe kitchen -- the hardest and most thankless work on an expedition\r\nlike this. No one says anything so long as the food is good; but\r\nlet the cook be unlucky and burn the soup one day, and he will hear\r\nsomething. Lindstrom had the excellent disposition of a man who is\r\nnever put out; whatever people might say, it was \"all the same\" to him.\r\n\r\nOn April 19 we saw the sun for the last time, since it then went\r\nbelow our horizon -- the ridge to the north. It was intensely red,\r\nand surrounded by a sea of flame, which did not disappear altogether\r\nuntil the 21st. Now everything was well. As far as the hut was\r\nconcerned, it could not be better; but the pent-house, which it was\r\noriginally intended to use as a workroom, soon proved too small,\r\ndark, and cold, besides which all the traffic went through that room,\r\nso that work would be constantly interrupted or stopped altogether\r\nat times. Except this dark hole we had no workroom, and we had a lot\r\nof work to do. Of course, we might use our living-room, but then we\r\nshould be in each other's way all day long; nor would it be a good\r\nplan to give up the only room where we could sometimes find peace\r\nand comfort to be a workshop. I know it is the usual custom to\r\ndo so, but I have always found it a bad arrangement. Now, indeed,\r\nwe were at our wits' end, but circumstances once more came to our\r\naid. For we may just as well confess it: we had forgotten to bring\r\nout a tool which is a commonplace necessity on a Polar expedition --\r\nnamely, a snow-shovel. A well-equipped expedition, as ours was to\r\na certain extent, ought to have at least twelve strong, thick iron\r\nspades. We had none. We had two remnants, but they did not help\r\nus very far. Fortunately, however, we had a very good, solid iron\r\nplate with us, and now Bjaaland stepped into the breach, and made a\r\nwhole dozen of the very best spades. Stubberud managed the handles,\r\nand they might all have been turned out by a big factory. This\r\ncircumstance had very important results for our future well-being,\r\nas will be seen. If we had had the shovels with us from the start,\r\nwe should have cleared the snow away from our door every morning,\r\nlike tidy people. But as we had none, the snow had increased daily\r\nbefore our door, and, before Bjaaland was ready with the spades,\r\nhad formed a drift extending from the entrance along the western side\r\nof the house. This snow-drift, which was as big as the house itself,\r\nnaturally caused some frowns, when one morning all hands turned out,\r\narmed with the new shovels, to make a clearance. As we stood there,\r\nafraid to begin, one of us -- it must have been Lindstrom, or Hanssen\r\nperhaps, or was it myself? well, it doesn't matter -- one of us had\r\nthe bright idea of taking Nature in hand, and working with her instead\r\nof against her. The proposal was that we should dig out a carpenter's\r\nshop in the big snow-drift, and put it in direct communication with\r\nthe hut. This was no sooner suggested than adopted unanimously. And\r\nnow began a work of tunnelling which lasted a good while, for one\r\nexcavation led to another, and we did not stop until we had a whole\r\nunderground village -- probably one of the most interesting works\r\never executed round a Polar station. Let us begin with the morning\r\nwhen we thrust the first spade into the drift; it was Thursday,\r\nApril 20. While three men went to work to dig right into the drift\r\nfrom the hut door westward, three more were busy connecting it with\r\nthe hut. This was done by stretching boards -- the same that we had\r\nused on the Fram as a false deck for the dogs -- from the drift up\r\nto the roof of the pent-house. The open part between the drift and\r\nthe pent-house on the northern side was filled up entirely into a\r\nsolid wall, which went up to join the roof that had just been put\r\non. The space between the pent-house and the drift on the south wall\r\nwas left open as an exit. But now we had the building fever on us,\r\nand one ambitious project succeeded another. Thus we agreed to dig\r\na passage the whole length of the drift, and terminate it by a large\r\nsnow-hut, in which we were to have a vapour bath. That was something\r\nlike a plan -- a vapour bath in 79deg.S. Hanssen, snow-hut builder by\r\nprofession, went to work at it. He built it quite small and solid,\r\nand extended it downward, so that, when at last it was finished, it\r\nmeasured 12 feet from floor to roof. Here we should have plenty of\r\nroom to fit up a vapour bath. Meanwhile the tunnellers were advancing;\r\nwe could hear the sound of their pickaxes and spades coming nearer\r\nand nearer. This was too much for Hanssen. As he had now finished\r\nthe hut, he set to work to dig his way to the others; and when he\r\nbegins a thing, it does not take him very long. We could hear the two\r\nparties continually nearing each other. The excitement increases. Will\r\nthey meet? Or are they digging side by side on different lines? The\r\nSimplon, Mont Cenis, and other engineering works, flashed through my\r\nbrain. If they were going to hit it off, we must be -- hullo! I was\r\ninterrupted in my studies by a glistening face, which was thrust\r\nthrough the wall just as I was going to dig my spade into it. It\r\nwas Wisting, pioneer of the Framheim tunnel. He had good reason to\r\nbe glad he escaped with his nose safe and sound. In another instant\r\nI should have had it on my spade. It was a fine sight, this long,\r\nwhite passage, ending in the high, shining dome. As we dug forward,\r\nwe dug down at the same time so as not to weaken the roof. There was\r\nplenty to take down below; the Barrier was deep enough.\r\n\r\nWhen this was finished, we began to work on the carpenter's shop. This\r\nhad to be dug considerably deeper, as the drift was rounded off\r\na little to the side. We therefore dug first into the drift, and\r\nthen right down; as far as I remember, we went 6 feet down into the\r\nBarrier here. The shop was made roomy, with space enough for both\r\ncarpenters and length enough for our sledges. The planing-bench was\r\ncut out in the wall and covered with boards. The workshop terminated\r\nat its western end in a little room, where the carpenters kept their\r\nsmaller tools. A broad stairway, cut in the snow and covered with\r\nboards, led from the shop into the passage. As soon as the workshop\r\nwas finished, the workmen moved in, and established themselves under\r\nthe name of the Carpenters' Union. Here the whole sledging outfit for\r\nthe Polar journey was remodelled. Opposite the carpenters came the\r\nsmithy, dug to the same depth as the other; this was less used. On the\r\nother side of the smithy, nearer to the hut, a deep hole was dug to\r\nreceive all the waste water from the kitchen. Between the Carpenters'\r\nUnion and the entrance to the pent-house, opposite the ascent to the\r\nBarrier, we built a little room, which, properly speaking, deserves\r\na very detailed explanation; but, for want of space, this must be\r\ndeferred till later. The ascent to the Barrier, which had been left\r\nopen while all these works were in progress, was now closed by a\r\ncontrivance which is also worth mentioning. There are a great many\r\npeople who apparently have never learnt to shut a door after them;\r\nwhere two or three are gathered together, you generally find at least\r\none who suffers from this defect. How many would there be among us,\r\nwho numbered nine? It is no use asking a victim of this complaint\r\nto shut the door after him; he is simply incapable of doing it. I\r\nwas not yet well enough acquainted with my companions as regards the\r\ndoor-shutting question, and in order to be on the safe side we might\r\njust as well put up a self-closing door. This was done by Stubberud,\r\nby fixing the door-frame into the wall in an oblique position just\r\nlike a cellar-door at home. Now the door could not stay open; it had\r\nto fall to. I was glad when I saw it finished; we were secured against\r\nan invasion of dogs. Four snow steps covered with boards led from\r\nthe door down into the passage. In addition to all these new rooms,\r\nwe had thus gained an extra protection for our house.\r\n\r\nWhile this work was in progress, our instrument-maker had his hands\r\nfull; the clockwork mechanism of the thermograph had gone wrong: the\r\nspindle was broken, I believe. This was particularly annoying, because\r\nthis thermograph had been working so well in low temperatures. The\r\nother thermograph had evidently been constructed with a view to the\r\ntropics; at any rate, it would not go in the cold. Our instrument-maker\r\nhas one method of dealing with all instruments -- almost without\r\nexception. He puts them in the oven, and stokes up the fire. This time\r\nit worked remarkably well, since it enabled him to ascertain beyond a\r\ndoubt that the thing was useless. The thermograph would not work in\r\nthe cold. Meanwhile he got it cleared of all the old oil that stuck\r\nto it everywhere, on wheels and pins, like fish-glue; then it was\r\nhung up to the kitchen ceiling. The temperature there may possibly\r\nrevive it, and make it think it is in the tropics. In this way we\r\nshall have the temperature of the \"galley\" registered, and later on\r\nwe shall probably be able to reckon up what we have had for dinner\r\nin the course of the week. Whether Professor Mohn will be overjoyed\r\nwith this result is another question, which the instrument-maker and\r\ndirector did not care to go into. Besides these instruments we have\r\na hygrograph -- we are well supplied; but this takes one of us out\r\nof doors once in the twenty-four hours. Lindstrom has cleaned it and\r\noiled it and set it going. In spite of this, at three in the morning\r\nit comes to a stop. But I have never seen Lindstrom beaten yet. After\r\nmany consultations he was given the task of trying to construct\r\na thermograph out of the hygrograph and the disabled thermograph;\r\nthis was just the job for him. The production he showed me a few\r\nhours later made my hair stand on end. What would Steen say? Do you\r\nknow what it was? Well, it was an old meat-tin circulating inside\r\nthe thermograph case. Heavens! what an insult to the self-registering\r\nmeteorological instruments! I was thunderstruck, thinking, of course,\r\nthat the man was making a fool of me. I had carefully studied his face\r\nall the time to find the key to this riddle, and did not know whether\r\nto laugh or weep. Lindstrom's face was certainly serious enough; if\r\nit afforded a measure of the situation, I believe tears would have\r\nbeen appropriate. But when my eye fell upon the thermograph and read,\r\n\"Stavanger Preserving Co.'s finest rissoles,\" I could contain myself\r\nno longer. The comical side of it was too much for me, and I burst\r\ninto a fit of laughter. When my laughter was subdued, I heard the\r\nexplanation. The cylinder did not fit, so he had tried the tin, and\r\nit went splendidly. The rissole-thermograph worked very well as far\r\nas -40deg. C., but then it gave up.\r\n\r\nOur forces were now divided into two working parties. One of them\r\nwas to dig out some forty seals we had lying about 3 feet under the\r\nsnow; this took two days. The heavy seals' carcasses, hard as flint,\r\nwere difficult to deal with. The dogs were greatly interested in\r\nthese proceedings. Each carcass, on being raised to the surface,\r\nwas carefully inspected; they were piled up in two heaps, and would\r\nprovide food enough for the dogs for the whole winter. Meanwhile the\r\nother party were at work under Hassel's direction on a petroleum\r\ncellar. The barrels which had been laid up at the beginning of\r\nFebruary were now deep below the snow. They now dug down at both ends\r\nof the store, and made a passage below the surface along the barrels;\r\nat the same time they dug far enough into the Barrier to give the\r\nrequisite height for the barrels. When the snow had been thrown out,\r\none hole was walled up again, while a large entrance was constructed\r\nover the other. Stubberud's knowledge of vaulting came in useful here,\r\nand he has the credit of having built the splendid arched entrance\r\nto the oil-store. It was a pleasure to go down into it; probably no\r\none has had so fine a storehouse for petroleum before. But Hassel did\r\nnot stop here; he had the building fever on him in earnest. His great\r\nproject of connecting the coal and wood store with the house below\r\nthe surface nearly took my breath away; it seemed to me an almost\r\nsuperhuman labour, but they did it. The distance from the coal-tent\r\nto the house was about ten yards. Here Hassel and Stubberud laid out\r\ntheir line so that it would strike the passage round the house at\r\nthe south-east angle. When they had done this, they dug a gigantic\r\nhole down into the Barrier half-way between the tent and the house,\r\nand then dug in both directions from here and soon finished the\r\nwork. But now Prestrud had an idea. While the hole remained open he\r\nwished to avail himself of the opportunity of arranging an observatory\r\nfor his pendulum apparatus, and he made a very good one. He did it by\r\ndigging at right angles to the passage, and had his little observatory\r\nbetween the coal-tent and the house. When all the snow was cleared\r\nout, the big hole was covered over again, and now we could go from\r\nthe kitchen direct to the coal-store without going out. First we\r\nfollowed the passage round the house -- you remember where all the\r\ntinned provisions stood in such perfect order -- then, on reaching\r\nthe south-east angle of the house, this new passage opened out and\r\nled across to the coal-tent. In the middle of the passage, on the\r\nright-hand side, a door led into the pendulum observatory. Continuing\r\nalong the passage, one came first to some steps leading down, and then\r\nthe passage ended in a steep flight of steps which led up through a\r\nhole in the snow surface. On going up this one suddenly found oneself\r\nin the middle of the coal-tent. It was a fine piece of work, and did\r\nall honour to its designers. It paid, too -- Hassel could now fetch\r\ncoal at any time under cover, and escaped having to go out of doors.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the end of our great underground works. We wanted a\r\nroom where Wisting could store all the things in his charge; he was\r\nspecially anxious about the reindeer-skin clothing, and wished to\r\nhave it under a roof. We therefore decided upon a room sufficiently\r\nlarge to house all these articles, and at the same time to provide\r\nworking-space for Wisting and Hanssen, who would have to lash all\r\nthe sledges as fast as they came from Bjaaland. Wisting elected to\r\nbuild this room in a big snow-drift that had formed around the tent\r\nin which he had kept all his stuff; the spot lay to the north-east\r\nof the house. The Clothing Store, as this building was called, was\r\nfairly large, and provided space not only for all our equipment, but\r\nalso for a workshop. From it a door led into a very small room, where\r\nWisting set up his sewing-machine and worked on it all through the\r\nwinter. Continuing in a north-easterly direction, we came to another\r\nbig room, called the Crystal Palace, in which all the ski and sledging\r\ncases were stored. Here all the provisions for the sledge journey were\r\npacked. For the time being this room remained separate from the others,\r\nand we had to go out of doors to reach it. Later, when Lindstrom had\r\ndug out an enormous hole in the Barrier at the spot where he took all\r\nthe snow and ice for cooking, we connected this with the two rooms last\r\nmentioned, and were thus finally able to go everywhere under the snow.\r\n\r\nThe astronomical observatory had also arisen; it lay right\r\nalongside the Crystal Palace. But it had an air of suffering from\r\ndebility, and before very long it passed peacefully away. Prestrud\r\nafterwards invented many patents; he used an empty barrel for a\r\ntime as a pedestal, then an old block of wood. His experience of\r\ninstrument-stands is manifold.\r\n\r\nAll these undertakings were finished at the beginning of May. One last\r\npiece of work remained, and then at last we should be ready. This was\r\nthe rebuilding of the depot. The small heaps in which the cases were\r\npiled proved unsatisfactory, as the passages between the different\r\npiles offered a fine site for snow-drifts. All the cases were now taken\r\nout and laid in two long rows, with sufficient intervals between them\r\nto prevent their offering resistance to the drifting snow. This work\r\nwas carried out in two days.\r\n\r\nThe days were now fairly short, and we were ready to take up our indoor\r\nwork. The winter duties were assigned as follows: Prestrud, scientific\r\nobservations; Johansen, packing of sledging provisions; Hassel had\r\nto keep Lindstrom supplied with coal, wood, and paraffin, and to make\r\nwhip-lashes -- an occupation he was very familiar with from the Fram's\r\nsecond expedition; Stubberud was to reduce the weight of the sledge\r\ncases to a minimum, besides doing a lot of other things. There was\r\nnothing he could not turn his hand to, so the programme of his winter\r\nwork was left rather vague. I knew he would manage a great deal more\r\nthan the sledge cases, though it must be said that it was a tiresome\r\njob he had. Bjaaland was allotted the task which we all regarded\r\nwith intense interest -- the alteration of the sledges. We knew that\r\nan enormous amount of weight could be saved, but how much? Hanssen\r\nand Wisting had to lash together the different parts as they were\r\nfinished; this was to be done in the Clothing Store. These two had\r\nalso a number of other things on their programme for the winter.\r\n\r\nThere are many who think that a Polar expedition is synonymous with\r\nidleness. I wish I had had a few adherents of this belief at Framheim\r\nthat winter; they would have gone away with a different opinion. Not\r\nthat the hours of work were excessively long, the circumstances\r\nforbade that. But during those hours the work was brisk.\r\n\r\nOn several previous sledge journeys I had made the experience that\r\nthermometers are very fragile things. It often happens that at the\r\nbeginning of a journey one breaks all one's thermometers, and is\r\nleft without any means of determining the temperature. If in such\r\ncircumstances one had accustomed oneself to guess the temperature,\r\nit would have given the mean temperature for the month with a fair\r\ndegree of accuracy. The guesses for single days might vary somewhat\r\nfrom reality on one side or the other, but, as I say, one would arrive\r\nat a fair estimate of the mean temperature. With this in my mind I\r\nstarted a guessing competition. As each man came in in the morning he\r\ngave his opinion of the temperature of the day, and this was entered\r\nin a book. At the end of the month the figures were gone through,\r\nand the one who had guessed correctly the greatest number of times\r\nwon the prize -- a few cigars. Besides giving practice in guessing the\r\ntemperature, it was a very good diversion to begin the day with. When\r\none day is almost exactly like another, as it was with us, the first\r\nhour of the morning is often apt to be a little sour, especially before\r\none has had one's cup of coffee. I may say at once that this morning\r\ngrumpiness very seldom showed itself with us. But one never knows --\r\none cannot always be sure. The most amiable man may often give one a\r\nsurprise before the coffee has had its effect. In this respect the\r\nguessing was an excellent thing; it took up everyone's attention,\r\nand diverted the critical moments. Each man's entrance was awaited\r\nwith excitement, and one man was not allowed to make his guess in\r\nthe hearing of the next -- that would undoubtedly have exercised an\r\ninfluence. Therefore they had to speak as they came in, one by one.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Stubberud, what's the temperature to-day ?\" Stubberud had his\r\nown way of calculating, which I never succeeded in getting at. One day,\r\nfor instance, he looked about him and studied the various faces.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't warm to-day,\" he said at last, with a great deal of\r\nconviction. I could immediately console him with the assurance that\r\nhe had guessed right. It was -69deg.F. The monthly results were very\r\ninteresting. So far as I remember, the best performance the competition\r\ncould show in any month was eight approximately correct guesses. A man\r\nmight keep remarkably close to the actual temperature for a long time,\r\nand then suddenly one day make an error of 25deg.. It proved that the\r\nwinner's mean temperature agreed within a few tenths of a degree with\r\nthe actual mean temperature of the month, and if one took the mean\r\nof all the competitors' mean temperatures, it gave a result which,\r\npractically speaking, agreed with the reality. It was especially\r\nwith this object in view that this guessing was instituted. If\r\nlater on we should be so unlucky as to lose all our thermometers,\r\nwe should not be entirely at a loss. It may be convenient to mention\r\nhere that on the southern sledge journey we had four thermometers\r\nwith us. Observations were taken three times daily, and all four\r\nwere brought home in undamaged condition. Wisting had charge of this\r\nscientific branch, and I think the feat he achieved in not breaking\r\nany thermometers is unparalleled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nA Day at Framheim\r\n\r\nIn order to understand our daily life better, we will now make a tour\r\nof Framheim. It is June 23, early in the morning. Perfect stillness\r\nlies over the Barrier -- such stillness as no one who has not been\r\nin these regions has any idea of. We come up the old sledge road from\r\nthe place where the Fram used to lie. You will stop several times on\r\nthe way and ask whether this can be real; anything so inconceivably\r\nbeautiful has never yet been seen. There lies the northern edge of the\r\nFram Barrier, with Mounts Nelson and Ronniken nearest; behind them,\r\nridge after ridge, peak after peak, the venerable pressure masses rise,\r\none higher than another. The light is so wonderful; what causes this\r\nstrange glow? It is clear as daylight, and yet the shortest day of the\r\nyear is at hand. There are no shadows, so it cannot be the moon. No;\r\nit is one of the few really intense appearances of the aurora australis\r\nthat receives us now. It looks as though Nature wished to honour our\r\nguests, and to show herself in her best attire. And it is a gorgeous\r\ndress she has chosen. Perfectly calm, clear with a starry sparkle,\r\nand not a sound in any direction. But wait: what is that? Like a\r\nstream of fire the light shoots across the sky, and a whistling sound\r\nfollows the movement. Hush! can't you hear? It shoots forward again,\r\ntakes the form of a band, and glows in rays of red and green. It\r\nstands still for a moment, thinking of what direction it shall take,\r\nand then away again, followed by an intermittent whistling sound. So\r\nNature has offered us on this wonderful morning one of her most\r\nmysterious, most incomprehensible, phenomena -- the audible southern\r\nlight. \"Now you will be able to go home and tell your friends that you\r\nhave personally seen and heard the southern lights, for I suppose you\r\nhave no doubt that you have really done so?\" \"Doubt? How can one be in\r\ndoubt about what one has heard with one's own ears and seen with one's\r\nown eyes? \"And yet you have been deceived, like so many others! The\r\nwhistling northern and southern lights have never existed. They are\r\nonly a creation of your own yearning for the mystical, accompanied\r\nby your own breath, which freezes in the cold air. Goodbye, beautiful\r\ndream! It vanishes from the glorious landscape.\" Perhaps it was stupid\r\nof me to call attention to that; my guests have now lost much of the\r\nbeautiful mystery, and the landscape no longer has the same attraction.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we have come up past Nelson and Ronniken, and are just\r\nclimbing the first ridge. Not far away a big tent rises before us,\r\nand in front of it we see two long, dark lines. It is our main depot\r\nthat we are coming to, and you can see that we keep our things in good\r\norder, case upon case, as if they had been placed in position by an\r\nexpert builder. And they all point the same way; all the numbers face\r\nthe north. \"What made you choose that particular direction?\" is the\r\nnatural question. \"Had you any special object?\" \"Oh yes, we had. If\r\nyou will look towards the east, you will notice that on the horizon\r\nthe sky has a rather lighter, brighter colour there than in any other\r\npart. That is the day as we see it now. At present we cannot see to\r\ndo anything by its light. It would have been impossible to see that\r\nthese cases were lying with their numbers to the north if it had not\r\nbeen for the brilliant aurora australis. But that light colour will\r\nrise and grow stronger. At nine o'clock it will be in the north-east,\r\nand we shall be able to trace it ten degrees above the horizon. You\r\nwould not then think it gave so much light as it really does, but you\r\nwould be able without an effort to read the numbers. What is more, you\r\nwould be able to read the makers' names which are marked on several\r\nof the cases, and when the flush of daylight has moved to the north,\r\nyou will be able to see them even more clearly. No doubt these figures\r\nand letters are big -- about 2 inches high and 14 inches broad --\r\nbut it shows, nevertheless, that we have daylight here at the darkest\r\ntime of the year, so there is not the absolute darkness that people\r\nthink. The tent that stands behind there contains dried fish; we have a\r\ngreat deal of that commodity, and our dogs can never suffer hunger. But\r\nnow we must hurry on, if we are to see how the day begins at Framheim.\r\n\r\n\"What we are passing now is the mark-flag. We have five of them\r\nstanding between the camp and the depot; they are useful on dark days,\r\nwhen the east wind is blowing and the snow falling. And there on the\r\nslope of the hill you see Framheim. At present it looks like a dark\r\nshadow on the snow, although it is not far away. The sharp peaks you\r\nsee pointing to the sky are all our dog tents. The but itself you\r\ncannot see; it is completely snowed under and hidden in the Barrier.\r\n\r\n\"But I see you are getting warm with walking. We will go a little more\r\nslowly, so that you won't perspire too much. It is not more than -51deg.,\r\nso you have every reason to be warm walking. With that temperature\r\nand calm weather like to-day one soon feels warm if one moves about\r\na little .... The flat place we have now come down into is a sort\r\nof basin; if you bend down and look round the horizon, you will\r\nbe able with an effort to follow the ridges and hummocks the whole\r\nway round. Our house lies on the slope we are now approaching. We\r\nchose that particular spot, as we thought it would offer the best\r\nprotection, and it turned out that we were right. The wind we have had\r\nhas nearly always come from the east, when there was any strength in\r\nit, and against such winds the slope provides an excellent shelter. If\r\nwe had placed our house over there where the depot stands, we should\r\nhave felt the weather much more severely. But now you must be careful\r\nwhen we come near to the house, so that the dogs don't hear us. We\r\nhave now about a hundred and twenty of them, and if they once start\r\nmaking a noise, then good-bye to the peaceful Polar morning. Now we\r\nare there, and in such daylight as there is, you can see the immediate\r\nsurroundings. You can't see the house, you say. No; I can quite believe\r\nit. That chimney sticking out of the snow is all there is left above\r\nthe Barrier. This trap-door we are coming to you might take for a loose\r\npiece of boarding thrown out on the snow, but that is not the case:\r\nit is the way down into our home. You must stoop a bit when you go\r\ndown into the Barrier. Everything is on a reduced scale here in the\r\nPolar regions; we can't afford to be extravagant. Now you have four\r\nsteps down; take care, they are rather high. Luckily we have come\r\nin time to see the day started. I see the passage-lamp is not yet\r\nlighted, so Lindstrom has not turned out. Take hold of the tail of\r\nmy anorak and follow me. This is a passage in the snow that we are\r\nin, leading to the pent-house. Oh! I'm so sorry; you must forgive\r\nme! Did you hurt yourself? I quite forgot to tell you to look out\r\nfor the threshold of the pent-house door. It is not the first time\r\nsomeone has fallen over it. That's a trap we have all fallen into;\r\nbut now we know it, and it doesn't catch us any more.\r\n\r\n\"If you will wait a second I'll strike a match, and then we shall\r\nsee our way. Here we are in the kitchen. Now make yourself invisible\r\nand follow me all day, and you will see what our life is like. As you\r\nknow, it is St. John's Eve, so we shall only work during the forenoon;\r\nbut you will be able to see how we spend a holiday evening. When you\r\nsend your account home, you must promise me not to paint it in too\r\nstrong colours. Good-bye for the present.\"\r\n\r\nBr-r-r-r-r-r! There's the alarm-clock. I wait and wait and wait. At\r\nhome I am always accustomed to hear that noise followed by the passage\r\nof a pair of bare feet across the floor, and a yawn or so. Here --\r\nnot a sound. When Amundsen left me he forgot to say where I could best\r\nput myself. I tried to follow him into the room, but the atmosphere\r\nthere -- no thanks! I could easily guess that nine men were sleeping\r\nin a room 19 feet by 13 feet; it did not require anyone to tell me\r\nthat. Still not a sound. I suppose they only keep that alarm-clock\r\nto make themselves imagine they are turning out. Wait a minute,\r\nthough. \"Lindtrom! Lindtrom!\" He went by the name of Lindtrom, not\r\nLindstrom. \"Now, by Jove! you've got to get up! The clock's made row\r\nenough.\" That's Wisting; I know his voice -- I know him at home. He\r\nwas always an early bird. A frightful crash! That's Lindstrom slipping\r\nout of his bunk. But if he was late in turning out, it did not take\r\nhim long to get into his clothes. One! two! three! and there he\r\nstood in the doorway, with a little lamp in his hand. It was now six\r\no'clock. He looked well; round and fat, as when I saw him last. He is\r\nin dark blue clothes, with a knitted helmet over his head. I should\r\nlike to know why; it is certainly not cold in here. For that matter,\r\nI have often felt it colder in kitchens at home in the winter, so that\r\ncannot be the reason. Oh, I have it! He is bald, and doesn't like to\r\nshow it. That is often the way with bald men; they hate anyone seeing\r\nit. The first thing he does is to lay the fire. The range is under the\r\nwindow, and takes up half the 6 feet by 13 feet kitchen. His method of\r\nlaying a fire is the first thing that attracts my attention. At home\r\nwe generally begin by splitting sticks and laying the wood in very\r\ncarefully. But Lindstrom just shoves the wood in anyhow, all over\r\nthe place. Well, if he can make that barn, he's clever. I am still\r\nwondering how he will manage it, when he suddenly stoops down and picks\r\nup a can. Without the slightest hesitation, as though it were the most\r\nnatural thing in the world, he pours paraffin over the wood. Not one\r\nor two drops -- oh no; he throws on enough to make sure. A match --\r\nand then I understood how Lindstrom got it to light. It was smartly\r\ndone, I must say -- but Hassel ought to have seen it! Amundsen had\r\ntold me something of their arrangements on the way up, and I knew\r\nHassel was responsible for coal, wood, and oil.\r\n\r\nThe water-pot had been filled the evening before, and he had only to\r\npush it to one side to make room for the kettle, and this did not take\r\nlong to boil with the heat he had set going. The fire burned up so that\r\nit roared in the chimney -- this fellow is not short of fuel. Strange,\r\nwhat a hurry he is in to get that coffee ready! I thought breakfast was\r\nat eight, and it is now not more than a quarter past six. He grinds the\r\ncoffee till his cheeks shake to and fro -- incessantly. If the quality\r\nis in proportion to the quantity, it must be good enough. \"Devil take\r\nit\" -- Lindstrom's morning greeting -- \"this coffee-mill is not worth\r\nthrowing to the pigs! Might just as well chew the beans. It wouldn't\r\ntake so long.\" And he is right; after a quarter of an hour's hard\r\nwork he has only ground just enough. Now it is half-past six. On with\r\nthe coffee! Ah, what a perfume! I would give something to know where\r\nAmundsen got it from. Meanwhile the cook has taken out his pipe,\r\nand is smoking away gaily on an empty stomach; it does not seem to\r\ndo him any harm. Hullo!  There's the coffee boiling over.\r\n\r\nWhile the coffee was boiling and Lindstrom smoked, I was still\r\nwondering why he was in such a hurry to get the coffee ready. You\r\nass! I thought; can't you see? Of course, he is going to give himself\r\na drink of fresh, hot coffee before the others are up; that's clear\r\nenough. When the coffee was ready, I sat down on a camp-stool that\r\nstood in a corner, and watched him. But I must say he surprised me\r\nagain. He pushed the coffee-kettle away from the fire and took down\r\na cup from the wall; then went to a jug that stood on the bench and\r\npoured out -- would you believe it? -- a cup of cold tea! If he goes on\r\nin this way, we shall have surprises enough before evening, I thought\r\nto myself. Then he began to be deeply interested in an enamelled iron\r\nbowl, which stood on a shelf above the range. The heat, which was\r\nnow intense (I looked at the thermograph which hung from the ceiling;\r\nit registered 84deg.F.), did not seem to be sufficient for its mysterious\r\ncontents. It was also wrapped up in towels and cloths, and gave me the\r\nimpression of having caught a severe cold. The glances he threw into it\r\nfrom time to time were anxious; he looked at the clock, and seemed to\r\nhave something on his mind. Then suddenly I saw his face brighten; he\r\ngave a long, not very melodious whistle, bent down, seized a dust-pan,\r\nand hurried out into the pent-house. Now I was really excited. What was\r\ncoming next? He came back at once with a happy smile all over his face,\r\nand the dust-pan full of -- coal! If I had been curious before, I was\r\nnow anxious. I withdrew as far as possible from the range, sat down on\r\nthe floor itself, and fixed my eyes on the thermograph. As I thought,\r\nthe pen began to move upward with rapid steps. This was too bad. I made\r\nup my mind to pay a visit to the Meteorological Institute as soon as\r\nI got home, and tell them what I had seen with my own eyes. But now\r\nthe heat seemed intolerable down on the floor, where I was sitting;\r\nwhat must it be like -- heavens above, the man was sitting on the\r\nstove! He must have gone out of his mind. I was just going to give\r\na cry of terror, when the door opened, and in came Amundsen from\r\nthe room. I gave a deep sigh. Now it would be all right the time\r\nwas ten minutes past seven. \"'Morning, Fatty!\" -- \"'Morning.\" --\r\n\"What's it like outside?\" -- \"Easterly breeze and thick when I was\r\nout; but that's a good while ago.\" This fairly took my breath away He\r\nstood there with the coolest air in the world and talked about the\r\nweather, and I could take my oath he had not been outside the door\r\nthat morning. \"How's it getting on to-day -- is it coming?\" Amundsen\r\nlooks with interest at the mysterious bowl. Lindstrom takes another\r\npeep under the cloth. \"Yes, it's coming at last; but I've had to give\r\nit a lot to-day.\" -- \" Yes, it feels like it,\" answers the other,\r\nand goes out. My interest is now divided between \"it \" in the bowl\r\nand Amundsen's return, with the meteorological discussion that will\r\nensue. It is not long before he reappears; evidently the temperature\r\noutside is not inviting. \"Let's hear again, my friend \" -- he seats\r\nhimself on the camp-stool beside which I am sitting on the floor --\r\n\"what kind of weather did you say it was?\" I prick up my ears;\r\nthere is going to be fun. \"It was an easterly breeze and thick as\r\na wall, when I was out at six o'clock.\" -- \"Hm! then it has cleared\r\nremarkably quickly. It's a dead calm now, and quite clear.\" -- \"Ah,\r\nthat's just what I should have thought! I could see it was falling\r\nlight, and it was getting brighter in the east.\" He got out of that\r\nwell. Meanwhile it was again the turn of the bowl. It was taken down\r\nfrom the shelf over the range and put on the bench; the various cloths\r\nwere removed one by one until it was left perfectly bare. I could\r\nnot resist any longer; I had to get up and look. And indeed it was\r\nworth looking at. The bowl was filled to the brim with golden-yellow\r\ndough, full of air-bubbles, and showing every sign that he had got\r\nit to rise. Now I began to respect Lindstrom; he was a devil of a\r\nfellow. No confectioner in our native latitudes could have shown a\r\nfiner dough. It was now 7.25; everything seems to go by the clock here.\r\n\r\nLindstrom threw a last tender glance at his bowl, picked up a little\r\nbottle of spirit, and went into the next room. I saw my chance of\r\nfollowing him in. There was not going to be any fun out there with\r\nAmundsen, who was sitting on the camp-stool half asleep. In the other\r\nroom it was pitch-dark, and an atmosphere -- no, ten atmospheres at\r\nleast! I stood still in the doorway and breathed heavily. Lindstrom\r\nstumbled forward in the darkness, felt for and found the matches. He\r\nstruck one, and lighted a spirit-holder that hung beneath a hanging\r\nlamp. There was not much to be seen by the light of the spirit flame;\r\none could still only guess. Hear too, perhaps. They were sound\r\nsleepers, those boys. One grunted here and another there; they were\r\nsnoring in every corner. The spirit might have been burning for a\r\ncouple of minutes, when Lindstrom had to set to work in a hurry. He was\r\noff just as the flame went out, leaving the room in black darkness. I\r\nheard the spirit bottle and the nearest stool upset, and what followed\r\nI don't know, as I was unfamiliar with the surroundings -- but there\r\nwas a good deal of it. I heard a click -- had no idea what it was\r\n-- and then the same movement back again to the lamp. Of course,\r\nhe now fell over the stool he had upset before. Meanwhile there was\r\na hissing sound, and a stifling smell of paraffin. I was thinking of\r\nmaking my escape through the door, when suddenly, just as I suppose\r\nit happened on the first day of Creation, in an instant there was\r\nlight. But it was a light that defies description; it dazzled and\r\nhurt the eyes, it was so bright. It was perfectly white and extremely\r\nagreeable -- when one was not looking at it. Evidently it was one of\r\nthe 200-candle Lux lamps. My admiration for Lindstrom had now risen\r\nto enthusiasm. What would I not have given to be able to make myself\r\nvisible, embrace him, and tell him what I thought of him! But that\r\ncould not be; I should not then be able to see life at Framheim as it\r\nreally was. So I stood still. Lindstrom first tried to put straight\r\nwhat he had upset in his struggle with the lamp. The spirit had, of\r\ncourse, run out of the bottle when it fell, and was now flowing all\r\nover the table. This did not seem to make the slightest impression\r\non him; a little scoop with his hand, and it all landed on Johansen's\r\nclothes, which were lying close by. This fellow seemed to be as well\r\noff for spirit as for paraffin. Then he vanished into the kitchen, but\r\nreappeared immediately with plates, cups, knives and forks. Lindstrom's\r\nlaying of the breakfast-table was the finest clattering performance\r\nI have ever heard. If he wanted to put a spoon into a cup, he did not\r\ndo it in the ordinary way; no, he put down the cup, lifted the spoon\r\nhigh in the air, and then dropped it into the cup. The noise he made\r\nin this way was infernal. Now I began to see why Amundsen had got\r\nup so early; he wanted to escape this process of laying the table,\r\nI expect. But this gave me at once an insight into the good-humour of\r\nthe gentlemen in bed: if this had happened anywhere else, Lindstrom\r\nwould have had a boot at his head. But here -- they must have been\r\nthe most peaceable men in the world.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I had had time to look around me. Close to the door where I\r\nwas standing a pipe came down to the floor. It struck me at once that\r\nthis was a ventilating-pipe. I bent down and put my hand over the\r\nopening; there was not so much as a hint of air to be felt. So this\r\nwas the cause of the bad atmosphere. The next things that caught my\r\neye were the bunks -- nine of them: three on the right hand and six\r\non the left. Most of the sleepers -- if they could be regarded as such\r\nwhile the table was being laid -- slept in bags -- sleeping-bags. They\r\nmust have been warm enough. The rest of the space was taken up by\r\na long table, with small stools on two sides of it. Order appeared\r\nto reign; most of the clothes were hung up. Of course, a few lay on\r\nthe floor, but then Lindstrom had been running about in the dark,\r\nand perhaps he had pulled them down. On the table, by the window,\r\nstood a gramophone and some tobacco-boxes and ash-trays. The furniture\r\nwas not plentiful, nor was it in the style of Louis Quinze or Louis\r\nSeize, but it was sufficient. On the wall with the window hung a few\r\npaintings, and on the other portraits of the King, Queen, and Crown\r\nPrince Olav, apparently cut out of an illustrated paper, and pasted\r\non blue cardboard. In the corner nearest the door on the right,\r\nwhere there was no bunk, the space seem to be occupied by clothes,\r\nsome hanging on the wall, some on lines stretched across. So that was\r\nthe drying-place, modest in its simplicity. Under the table were some\r\nvarnished boxes -- Heaven knows what they were for!\r\n\r\nNow there seemed to be life in one of the bunks. It was Wisting,\r\nwho was getting tired of the noise that still continued. Lindstrom\r\ntook his time, rattling the spoons, smiling maliciously to himself,\r\nand looking up at the bunks. He did not make all this racket for\r\nnothing. Wisting, then, was the first to respond, and apparently the\r\nonly one; at any rate, there was not a sign of movement in any of the\r\nothers. \"Good-morning, Fatty!\" \"Thought you were going to stop there\r\ntill dinner.\" This is Lindstrom's greeting. \"Look after yourself, old\r\n'un. If I hadn't got you out, you'd have been asleep still.\" That was\r\npaying him in his own coin: Wisting was evidently not to be trifled\r\nwith. However, they smiled and nodded to each other in a way that\r\nshowed that there was no harm meant. At last Lindstrom had got rid\r\nof the last cup, and brought down the curtain on that act with the\r\ndropping of the final spoon. I thought now that he would go back to his\r\nwork in the kitchen; but it looked as if he had something else to do\r\nfirst. He straightened himself, thrust his chin in the air and put his\r\nhead back -- reminding me very forcibly of a young cockerel preparing\r\nto crow -- and roared with the full force of his lungs: \"Turn out,\r\nboys, and look sharp!\" Now he had finished his morning duty there. The\r\nsleeping-bags seemed suddenly to awake to life, and such remarks as,\r\n\"That's a devil of a fellow!\" or \"Shut up, you old chatterbox!\" showed\r\nthat the inhabitants of Framheim were now awake. Beaming with joy,\r\nthe cause of the trouble disappeared into the kitchen.\r\n\r\nAnd now, one after the other they stick their heads out, followed by\r\nthe rest of them. That must be Helmer Hanssen, who was on the Gjoa;\r\nhe looks as if he could handle a rope. Ah, and there we have Olav\r\nOlavson Bjaaland! I could have cried aloud for joy -- my old friend\r\nfrom Holmenkollen. The great long-distance runner, you remember. And\r\nhe managed the jump, too -- 50 metres, I think -- standing. If Amundsen\r\nhas a few like him, he will get to the Pole all right. And there comes\r\nStubberud, the man the Aftenpost said was so clever at double-entry\r\nbook-keeping. As I see him now, he does not give me the impression\r\nof being a book-keeper -- but one can't tell. And here come Hassel,\r\nJohansen, and Prestrud; now they are all up, and will soon begin the\r\nday's work.\r\n\r\n\"Stubberud!\" It is Lindstrom putting his head in at the door. \"If\r\nyou want any hot cakes, you must get some air down.\" Stubberud merely\r\nsmiles; he looks as if he felt sure of getting them, all the same. What\r\nwas it he talked about? Hot cakes? They must be connected with the\r\nbeautiful dough and the delicate, seductive smell of cooking that is\r\nnow penetrating through the crack of the door. Stubberud is going,\r\nand I must go with him. Yes, as I thought -- there stands Lindstrom\r\nin all his glory before the range, brandishing the weapon with which\r\nhe turns the cakes; and in a pan lie three brownish-yellow buckwheat\r\ncakes quivering with the heat of the fire. Heavens, how hungry it\r\nmade me! I take up my old position, so as not to be in anyone's\r\nway, and watch Lindstrom. He's the man -- he produces hot cakes with\r\nastonishing dexterity; it almost reminds one of a juggler throwing up\r\nballs, so rapid and regular is the process. The way he manipulates\r\nthe cake-slice shows a fabulous proficiency. With the skimmer in\r\none hand he dumps fresh dough into the pan, and with the cake-slice\r\nin the other he removes those that are done, all at the same time;\r\nit seems almost more than human!\r\n\r\nThere comes Wisting, salutes, and holds out a little tin mug. Flattered\r\nby the honour, the cook fills his mug with boiling water, and he\r\ndisappears into the pent-house. But this interruption puts Lindstrom\r\noff his jugglery with the hot cakes-one of them rolls down on to the\r\nfloor. This fellow is extraordinarily phlegmatic; I can't make out\r\nwhether he missed that cake or not. I believe the sigh that escaped\r\nhim at the same instant meant something like: \"Well, we must leave\r\nsome for the dogs.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now they all come in single file with their little mugs, and get\r\neach a drop of boiling water. I get up, interested in this proceeding,\r\nand slip out with one of them into the pent-house and so on to the\r\nBarrier. You will hardly believe me, when I tell you what I saw -- all\r\nthe Polar explorers standing in a row, brushing their teeth! What do\r\nyou say to that? So they are not such absolute pigs, after all. There\r\nwas a scent of Stomatol everywhere.\r\n\r\nHere comes Amundsen. He has evidently been out taking the\r\nmeteorological observations, as he holds the anemometer in one hand. I\r\nfollow him through the passage, and, when no one is looking, take the\r\nopportunity of slapping him on the shoulder and saying \"A grand lot\r\nof boys.\" He only smiled; but a smile may often say more than many\r\nwords. I understood what it meant; he had known that a long while\r\nand a good deal more.\r\n\r\nIt was now eight o'clock. The door from the kitchen to the room was\r\nleft wide open, and the warmth streamed in and mixed with the fresh\r\nair that Stubberud had now forced to come down the right way. Now\r\nit was pleasanter inside -- fresh, warm air everywhere. Then came\r\na very interesting scene. As the tooth-brushing gentlemen returned,\r\nthey had to guess the temperature, one by one. This gave occasion for\r\nmuch joking and fun, and, amid laughter and chat, the first meal of the\r\nday was taken. In after-dinner speeches, amid toasts and enthusiasm,\r\nour Polar explorers are often compared with our forefathers, the bold\r\nvikings. This comparison never occurred to me for a moment when I saw\r\nthis assemblage of ordinary, everyday men-brushing their teeth. But\r\nnow that they were busy with the dishes, I was bound to acknowledge\r\nits aptitude; for our forefathers the vikings could not possibly have\r\nattacked their food with greater energy than these nine men did.\r\n\r\nOne pile of \"hot-chek\" after another disappeared as if they had been\r\nmade of air -- and I, in my simplicity, had imagined that one of them\r\nwas a man's ration! Spread with butter and surmounted with jam, these\r\ncakes slipped down with fabulous rapidity. With a smile I thought\r\nof the conjurer, holding an egg in his hand one minute and making\r\nit disappear the next. If it is a cook's best reward to see his food\r\nappreciated, then, indeed, Lindstrom had good wages. The cakes were\r\nwashed down with big bowls of strong, aromatic coffee. One could\r\nsoon trace the effect, and conversation became general. The first\r\ngreat subject was a novel, which was obviously very popular, and was\r\ncalled \"The Rome Express.\" It appeared to me, from what was said --\r\nI have unfortunately never read this celebrated work -- that a murder\r\nhad been committed in this train, and a lively discussion arose as\r\nto who had committed it. I believe the general verdict was one of\r\nsuicide. I have always supposed that subjects of conversation must\r\nbe very difficult to find on expeditions like these, where the same\r\npeople mix day after day for years; but there was certainly no sign\r\nof any such difficulty here. No sooner had the express vanished in\r\nthe distance than in steamed -- the language question. And it came\r\nat full steam, too. It was clear that there were adherents of both\r\ncamps present. For fear of hurting the feelings of either party, I\r\nshall abstain from setting down what I heard: but I may say as much\r\nas this -- that the party of reform ended by declaring the maal[6] to\r\nbe the only proper speech of Norway, while their opponents maintained\r\nthe same of their language.\r\n\r\nAfter a while pipes came out, and the scent of \"plug\" soon struggled\r\nwith the fresh air for supremacy. Over the tobacco the work for\r\nthe day was discussed. \"Well, I'll have enough to do supplying that\r\nwoodswallower over the holiday,\" said Hassel. I gave a chuckle. If\r\nHassel had known of the way the paraffin was used that morning,\r\nhe would have added something about the \"oil-drinker,\" I expect. It\r\nwas now half-past eight, and Stubberud and Bjaaland got up. From the\r\nnumber of different garments they took out and put on, I guessed they\r\nwere going out. Without saying anything, they trudged out. Meanwhile\r\nthe others continued their morning smoke, and some even began to\r\nread, but by about nine they were all on the move. They put on their\r\nskin clothing and made ready to go out. By this time Bjaaland and\r\nStubberud had returned from a walk, as I understood from such remarks\r\nas \"Beastly cold,\" \"Sharp snow by the depot,\" and the like. Prestrud\r\nwas the only one who did not get ready to go out; he went to an open\r\nspace underneath the farthest bunk, where there was a box. He raised\r\nthe lid of this, and three chronometers appeared; at the same moment\r\nthree of the men produced their watches, and a comparison was made\r\nand entered in a book. After each watch had been compared, its owner\r\nwent outside, taking his watch with him. I took the opportunity of\r\nslipping out with the last man -- Prestrud and his chronometers were\r\ntoo serious for me; I wanted to see what the others were about.\r\n\r\nThere was plenty of life outside; dogs' howls in every key came\r\nfrom the tents. Some of those who had left the house before us were\r\nout of sight, so they had probably gone to their respective tents,\r\nand presently one could see by the lights that they were in the act\r\nof letting their dogs loose. How well the lighted-up tents looked\r\nagainst the dark, star-strewn sky! Though it could no longer be\r\ncalled dark: the little flush of dawn had spread and overpowered\r\nthe glow of the aurora australis, which had greatly decreased since\r\nI last saw it; evidently it was near its end. Now the four-footed\r\nband began to swarm out, darting like rockets from the tents. Here\r\nwere all colours-grey, black, red, brown, white, and a mixture of\r\nall of them. What surprised me was that they were all so small; but\r\notherwise they looked splendid. Plump and round, well kept and groomed,\r\nbursting with life. They instantly collected into little groups of\r\nfrom two to five, and it was easy to see that these groups consisted\r\nof intimate friends -- they absolutely petted each other. In each\r\nof these clusters there was one in particular who was made much of;\r\nall the others came round him, licked him, fawned upon him, and gave\r\nhim every sign of deference.\r\n\r\nThey all run about without a sign of unfriendliness. Their chief\r\ninterest seems to be centred in two large black mounds that are visible\r\nin the foreground of the camp; what they are I am unable to make out --\r\nthere is not light enough for that -- but I am probably not far wrong\r\nin guessing that they are seals. They are rather hard eating, anyhow,\r\nfor I can hear them crunching under the dogs' teeth. Here there is an\r\noccasional disturbance of the peace; they do not seem to agree so well\r\nover their food, but there is never a regular battle. A watchman is\r\npresent, armed with a stick, and when he shows himself and makes his\r\nvoice heard, they soon separate. They appear to be well disciplined.\r\n\r\nWhat appealed to me most was the youngsters and the youngest of\r\nall. The young ones, to judge from their appearance, were about ten\r\nmonths old. They were perfect in every way; one could see they had been\r\nwell cared for from their birth. Their coats were surprisingly thick --\r\nmuch more so than those of the older dogs. They were remarkably plucky,\r\nand would not give in to anyone.\r\n\r\nAnd there are the smallest of all -- like little balls of wool; they\r\nroll themselves in the snow and have great fun. I am astonished that\r\nthey can stand the cold as they do; I should never have thought that\r\nsuch young animals could live through the winter. Afterwards I was\r\ntold that they not only bore the cold well, but were far more hardy\r\nthan the older ones. While the grown-up dogs were glad to go into their\r\ntents in the evening, the little ones refused to do so; they preferred\r\nto sleep outside. And they did so for a great part of the winter.\r\n\r\nNow all the men have finished unchaining their dogs, and, with\r\ntheir lanterns in their hands, they move in various directions and\r\ndisappear -- apparently into the Barrier surface. There will be many\r\ninteresting things to see here in the course of the day -- I can\r\nunderstand that. What on earth became of all these people? There we\r\nhave Amundsen; he is left alone, and appears to be in charge of the\r\ndogs. I go up to him and make myself known.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I'm glad you came,\" he says; \"now I can introduce you to some\r\nof our celebrities. To begin with, here is the trio -- Fix, Lasse,\r\nand Snuppesen. They always behave like this when I am out -- could\r\nnot think of leaving me in peace for an instant. Fix, that big grey\r\none that looks like a wolf, has many a snap on his conscience. His\r\nfirst exploit was on Flekkero, near Christiansand, where all the\r\ndogs were kept for a month after they arrived from Greenland; there\r\nhe gave Lindstrom a nasty bite when his back was turned. What do you\r\nthink of a bite of a mouth like that?\"\r\n\r\nFix is now tame, and without a growl allows his master to take hold of\r\nhis upper and under jaws and open his mouth -- ye gods, what teeth! I\r\ninwardly rejoice that I was not in Lindstrom's trousers that day.\r\n\r\n\"If you notice,\" he continues, with a smile, \"you will see that\r\nLindstrom still sits down cautiously. I myself have a mark on my left\r\ncalf, and a good many more of us have the same. There are several of\r\nus who still treat him with respect. And here we have Lassesen --\r\nthat's his pet name; he was christened Lasse -- almost pure black,\r\nas you see. I believe he was the wildest of the lot when they came\r\non board. I had him fastened up on the bridge with my other dogs,\r\nbeside Fix -- those two were friends from their Greenland days. But\r\nI can tell you that when I had to pass Lasse, I always judged the\r\ndistance first. As a rule, he just stood looking down at the deck\r\n-- exactly like a mad bull. If I tried to make overtures, he didn't\r\nmove -- stood quite still; but I could see how he drew back his upper\r\nlip and showed a row of teeth, with which I had no desire to become\r\nacquainted. A fortnight passed in this way. Then at last the upper\r\nlip sank and the head was raised a little, as though he wanted to see\r\nwho it was that brought him food and water every day. But the way from\r\nthat to friendship was long and tortuous. In the time that followed,\r\nI used to scratch him on the back with a stick; at first he jumped\r\nround, seized the stick, and crushed it between his teeth. I thought\r\nmyself lucky that it was not my hand. I came a little nearer to him\r\nevery day, until one day I risked my hand. He gave me an ugly look,\r\nbut did nothing; and then came the beginning of our friendship. Day\r\nby day we became better friends, and now you can see what footing we\r\nare on. The third is Snuppesen, a dark red lady; she is their sworn\r\nfriend, and never leaves them. She is the quickest and most active\r\nof our dogs. You can see that she is fond of me; she is generally on\r\nher hind legs, and makes every effort to get at my face. I have tried\r\nto get her out of the way of that, but in vain; she will have her own\r\nway. I have no other animals for the moment that are worth showing --\r\nunless you would care to hear a song. If so, there is Uranus, who is a\r\nprofessional singer. We'll take the trio with us, and you shall hear.\"\r\n\r\nWe made for two black-and-white dogs that were lying by themselves\r\non the snow a little way off, while the three jumped and danced about\r\nus. As we approached the other two, and they caught sight of the trio,\r\nthey both jumped up as though at a word of command, and I guessed that\r\nwe had found the singer. Lord save us, what an awful voice! I could\r\nsee that the concert was for Lasse's benefit, and Uranus kept it up as\r\nlong as we stood in his vicinity. But then my attention was suddenly\r\naroused by the appearance of another trio, which made an extraordinary\r\nfavourable impression. I turned to my companion for information.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he continued, \"those are three of Hanssen's team; probably some\r\nof our best animals. The big black-and-white one is called Zanko -- he\r\nappears to be rather old; the two others, which look like sausages with\r\nmatches underneath, are Ring and Mylius. As you see, they are not very\r\nbig, rather on the small side, but they are undoubtedly among our best\r\nworkers. From their looks we have concluded that they are brothers --\r\nthey are as like as two drops of water. Now we will go straight through\r\nthe mass and see whether we come across any more celebrities. There we\r\nhave Karenius, Sauen, Schwartz, and Lucy; they belong to Stubberud, and\r\nare a power in the camp. Bjaaland's tent is close by; his favourites\r\nare lying there -- Kvaen, Lap, Pan, Gorki, and Jaala. They are small,\r\nall of them, but fine dogs. There, in the south-east corner, stands\r\nHassel's tent, but we shall not see any of his dogs here now. They\r\nare all lying outside the entrance to the oil-store, where he is\r\ngenerally to be found. The next tent is Wisting's. We must take a\r\nturn round there and see if we can find his lot. There they are --\r\nthose four playing there. The big, reddish-brown one on the right is\r\nthe Colonel, our handsomest animal. His three companions are Suggen,\r\nArne, and Brun. I must tell you a little story about the Colonel when\r\nhe was on Flekkero. He was perfectly wild then, and he broke loose\r\nand jumped into the sea. He wasn't discovered till he was half-way\r\nbetween Flekkero and the mainland, where he was probably going in\r\nsearch of a joint of mutton. Wisting and Lindstrom, who were then\r\nin charge of the dogs, put off in a boat, and finally succeeded in\r\novertaking him, but they had a hard tussle before they managed to get\r\nhim on board. Afterwards Wisting had a swimming-race with the Colonel,\r\nbut I don't remember what was the result. We can expect a great deal\r\nof these dogs. There's Johansen's tent over in the corner; there is\r\nnot much to be said about his dogs. The most remarkable of them is\r\nCamilla. She is an excellent mother, and brings up her children very\r\nwell; she usually has a whole army of them, too.\r\n\r\n\"Now I expect you have seen dogs enough, so, if you have no objection,\r\nI will show you underground Framheim and what goes on there. I\r\nmay just as well add that we are proud of this work, and you will\r\nprobably find that we have a right to be. We'll begin with Hassel,\r\nas his department is nearest.\"\r\n\r\nWe now went in the direction of the house, passed its western end,\r\nand soon arrived at an erection that looked like a derrick. Underneath\r\nit was a large trap-door. Where the three legs of the derrick met,\r\nthere was made fast a small block, and through the block ran a rope,\r\nmade fast at one end to the trap-door. A weight hung at the other end,\r\nsome feet above the surface of the snow.\r\n\r\n\"Now we are at Hassel's,\" said my companion. It was a good thing he\r\ncould not see me, for I must have looked rather foolish. At Hassel's? I\r\nsaid to myself. What in the world does the man mean? We were standing\r\non the bare Barrier.\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear that noise? That's Hassel sawing wood.\"\r\n\r\nNow he bent down and raised the heavy trap-door easily with the help\r\nof the weight. Broad steps of snow led down, deep down, into the\r\nBarrier. We left the trap-door open, so as to have the benefit of\r\nthe little daylight there was. My host went first; I followed. After\r\ndescending four or five steps, we came to a doorway which was covered\r\nwith a woollen curtain. We pushed this aside. The sound that had\r\nfirst reached me as a low rumbling now became sharper, and I could\r\nplainly hear that it was caused by sawing. We went in. The room we\r\nentered was long and narrow, cut out of the Barrier. On a solid shelf\r\nof snow there lay barrel after barrel arranged in exemplary order;\r\nif they were all full of paraffin, I began to understand Lindstrom's\r\nextravagance in lighting his fire in the morning: here was paraffin\r\nenough for several years. In the middle of the room a lantern was\r\nhanging, an ordinary one with wire netting round the glass. In a\r\ndark room it certainly would not have given much light, but in these\r\nwhite surroundings it shone like the sun. A Primus lamp was burning on\r\nthe floor. The thermometer, which hung a little way from the Primus,\r\nshowed -5deg. F., so Hassel could hardly complain of the heat, but he\r\nhad to saw, so it did not matter. We approached Hassel. He looked\r\nas if he had plenty to do, and was sawing away so that the sawdust\r\nwas flying. \"'Morning.\" -- \"'Morning.\" The sawdust flew faster and\r\nfaster. \"You seem to be busy to-day.\" -- \"Oh yes!\" -- the saw was now\r\nworking with dangerous rapidity --  \"if I'm to get finished for the\r\nholiday, I must hurry up.\" --  How's the coal-supply getting on?\" That\r\ntook effect. The saw stopped instantly, was raised, and put down by the\r\nwall. I waited for the next step in suppressed excitement; something\r\nhitherto undreamt of must be going to happen. Hassel looked round --\r\none can never be careful enough -- approached my host, and whispered,\r\nwith every sign of caution \"I did him out of twenty-five kilos last\r\nweek.\" I breathed again; I had expected something much worse than\r\nthat. With a smile of satisfaction Hassel resumed his interrupted work,\r\nand I believe nothing in the world would have stopped him again. The\r\nlast I saw as we returned through the doorway was Hassel surrounded\r\nby a halo of sawdust.\r\n\r\nWe were back on the Barrier surface; a touch of the finger, and\r\nthe trap-door swung over and fell noiselessly into its place. I\r\ncould see that Hassel was capable of other things besides sawing\r\nbirchwood. Outside lay his team, guarding all his movements -- Mikkel,\r\nRaeven, Masmas, and Else. They all looked well. Now we were going to\r\nsee the others.\r\n\r\nWe went over to the entrance of the hut and raised the trap-door;\r\na dazzling light met my eyes. In the wall of the steps leading down\r\nfrom the surface a recess had been cut to hold a wooden case lined with\r\nbright tin; this contained a little lamp which produced this powerful\r\nlight. But it was the surroundings that made it so bright -- ice and\r\nsnow everywhere. Now I could look about me for the first time; it had\r\nbeen dark when I came in the morning. There was the snow-tunnel leading\r\nto the pent-house; I could see that by the threshold that grinned\r\nat me. But there, in the opposite direction, what was there? I could\r\nsee that the passage was continued, but where did it lead? Standing\r\nin the bright light, it looked quite dark in the tunnel.\r\n\r\n\"Now we will go and see Bjaaland first.\" With these words my companion\r\nbent down, and set off through the dark passage. \"Look there, in the\r\nsnow-wall -- just under our feet -- can you see the light?\" By degrees\r\nmy eyes had accustomed themselves to the darkness of the tunnel, and\r\nI could see a greenish light shining through the snow-wall where he\r\npointed. And now another noise fell on my ears -- a monotonous sound --\r\ncoming from below.\r\n\r\n\"Look out for the steps!\" Yes, he could be sure of that; I had come\r\none cropper that day, and it was enough. We once more descended into\r\nthe Barrier by broad, solid snow-steps covered with boards. Suddenly\r\na door was opened -- a sliding-door in the snow-wall -- and I stood\r\nin Bjaaland's and Stubberud's premises. The place might be about 6\r\nfeet high, 15 feet long, and 7 feet wide. On the floor lay masses of\r\nshavings, which made it warm and cosy. At one end stood a Primus lamp\r\nwith a large tin case over it, from which steam was issuing. \"How\r\nis it going?\" -- \"All right. We're just bending the runners. I've\r\nmade a rough estimate of the weight, and find I can bring it down\r\nto 48 pounds.\" This seemed to me almost incredible. Amundsen had\r\ntold me on the way up this morning of the heavy sledges they had\r\n-- 165 pounds each. And now Bjaaland was going to bring them down\r\nto 48 pounds, less than a third of their original weight. In the\r\nsnow-walls of the room were fixed hooks and shelves, where the tools\r\nwere kept. Bjaaland's carpenter's bench was massive enough -- cut\r\nout in the snow and covered with boards. Along the opposite wall was\r\nanother planing-bench, equally massive, but somewhat shorter than the\r\nfirst. This was evidently Stubberud's place. He was not here to-day,\r\nbut I could see that he was engaged in planing down the sledge cases\r\nand making them lighter. One of them was finished; I leaned forward\r\nand looked at it. On the top, where a little round aluminium lid\r\nwas let in, was written: \"Original weight, 9 kilos; reduced weight,\r\n6 kilos.\" I could understand what this saving of weight meant to men\r\nwho were going on such a journey as these had before them. One lamp\r\nprovided all the illumination, but it gave an excellent light. We\r\nleft Bjaaland. I felt sure that the sledging outfit was in the best\r\nof hands.\r\n\r\nWe then made our way into the pent-house, and here we met Stubberud. He\r\nwas engaged in cleaning up and putting things straight for the\r\nholiday. All the steam that came out of the kitchen, when the door\r\nwas opened, had condensed on the roof and walls in the form of rime\r\nseveral inches thick, and Stubberud was now clearing this off with a\r\nlong broom. Everything was going to be shipshape for Midwinter Eve;\r\nI could see that. We went in. Dinner was on, humming and boiling. The\r\nkitchen floor was scrubbed clean, and the linoleum with which it was\r\ncovered shone gaily. It was the same in the living-room; everything\r\nwas cleaned. The linoleum on the floor and the American cloth on the\r\ntable were equally bright. The air was pure -- absolutely pure. All\r\nthe bunks were made tidy, and the stools put in their places. There\r\nwas no one here.\r\n\r\n\"You have only seen a fraction of our underground palaces, but I\r\nthought we would take a turn in the loft first and see what it is\r\nlike. Follow me.\" We went out into the kitchen, and then up some steps\r\nfastened in the wall, and through the trap-door to the loft. With the\r\nhelp of a little electric lamp, we were able to look about us. The\r\nfirst thing that met my eyes was the library. There stood the Framheim\r\nlibrary, and it made the same good impression as everything else --\r\nbooks numbered from 1 to 80 in three shelves. The catalogue lay by the\r\nside of them, and I cast my eye over it. Here were books to suit all\r\ntastes; \"Librarian, Adolf Henrik Lindstrom,\" I read at the end. So\r\nhe was librarian, too-truly a many-sided man. Long rows of cases\r\nstood here, full of whortleberry jam, cranberries, syrup, cream,\r\nsugar, and pickles. In one corner I saw every sign of a dark-room;\r\na curtain was hung up to keep the light off, and there was an array\r\nof developing-dishes, measuring-glasses, etc. This loft was made good\r\nuse of. We had now seen everything, and descended again to continue\r\nour inspection.\r\n\r\nJust as we reached the pent-house, Lindstrom came in with a big bucket\r\nof ice; I understood that it was to be used in the manufacture of\r\nwater. My companion had armed himself with a large and powerful\r\nlantern, and I saw that we were going to begin our underground\r\ntravels. In the north wall of the pent-house there was a door, and\r\nthrough this we went, entering a passage built against the house, and\r\ndark as the grave. The lantern had lost its power of illumination;\r\nit burned with a dull, dead light, which did not seem to penetrate\r\nbeyond the glass. I stretched my hands in front of me. My host stopped\r\nand gave me a lecture on the wonderful order and tidiness they had\r\nsucceeded in establishing among them. I was a willing listener, for\r\nI had already seen enough to be able to certify the truth of what he\r\ntold me without hesitation. But in the place we were now in, I had\r\nto take his word for it, for it was all as black as bilge-water. We\r\nhad just started to move on again, and I felt so secure, after\r\nall he had told me about the orderly way things were kept, that I\r\nlet go my guide's anorak, which I had been holding. But that was\r\nfoolish of me. Smack! I went down at full length. I had trodden\r\non something round -- something that brought me down. As I fell,\r\nI caught hold of something -- also round -- and I lay convulsively\r\nclutching it. I wanted to convince myself of what it was that lay\r\nabout on the floor of such a tidy house. The glimmer of the lantern,\r\nthough not particularly strong, was enough to show me what I held\r\nin my arms -- a Dutch cheese! I put it back in the same place --\r\nfor the sake of tidiness -- sat up, and looked down at my feet. What\r\nwas it I had stumbled over? A Dutch cheese -- if it wasn't another\r\nof the same family! I began to form my own opinion of the tidiness\r\nnow, but said nothing. But I should like to know why he didn't fall\r\nover the cheeses, as he was walking in front. Oh, I answered myself,\r\nI guess he knew what sort of order the place was in.\r\n\r\nAt the eastern end of the house the passage was brilliantly lighted\r\nup by the window that looked out on this side; I could now see\r\nmore clearly where I was. Opposite the window, in the part of the\r\nBarrier that here formed the other wall of the passage, a great hole\r\nhad been dug; nothing was to be seen in it but black darkness. My\r\ncompanion knew his way, so I could rely upon him, but I should have\r\nhesitated to go in there alone. The hole extended into the Barrier,\r\nand finally formed a fairly large room with a vaulted roof. A spade\r\nand an axe on the floor were all I saw. What in the world was this\r\nhall used for? \"You see, all the ice and snow from here has gone to\r\nour water-supply.\" So this was Lindstrom's quarry, from which he\r\nhad hewn out ice and snow all these months for cooking, drinking,\r\nand washing. In one of the walls, close to the floor, there was a\r\nlittle hole just big enough for a man to crawl through.\r\n\r\n\"Now you must make yourself small and follow me; we are going to visit\r\nHanssen and Wisting.\" And my companion disappeared like a snake into\r\nthe hole. I threw myself down, quick as lightning, and followed. I\r\nwould not have cared to be left alone there in pitch-darkness. I\r\nmanaged to get hold of one of his calves, and did not let go until\r\nI saw light on the other side. The passage we crept through was\r\nequally narrow all the way, and forced one to crawl on hands and\r\nknees; fortunately, it was not long. It ended in a fairly large,\r\nsquare room. A low table stood in the middle of the floor, and on\r\nit Helmer Hanssen was engaged in lashing sledges. The room gave\r\none the impression of being badly lighted, though it had a lamp and\r\ncandles. On a closer examination, I found that this was due to the\r\nnumber of dark objects the place contained. Against one of the walls\r\nthere was clothing -- immense piles of skin -- clothing. Over this\r\nwere spread blankets to protect it from the rime that was formed on\r\nthe roof and fell down. Against the opposite wall was a stack of\r\nsledges, and at the end, opposite the door, were piles of woollen\r\nunderclothing. Any outfitter in Christiania might have envied this\r\nstock; here one saw Iceland jackets, sweaters, underclothes of immense\r\nthickness and dimensions, stockings, mits, etc. In the corner formed\r\nby this wall and the one where the sledges stood was the little hole\r\nby which we had entered. Beyond the sledges, in the same wall, there\r\nwas a door with a curtain in front of it, and from within it came a\r\nstrange humming. I was much interested to know what this might be,\r\nbut had to hear first what these two had to say.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of the lashings now, Hanssen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they'll hold right enough; at any rate, they'll be better than\r\nthey were before. Look here, how they've pointed the ends!\"\r\n\r\nI leaned forward to see what was wrong with the sledge-lashings, and,\r\nI must say, what I saw surprised me. Is such a thing possible? The\r\npointing of a lashing is a thing a sailor is very careful about. He\r\nknows that if the end is badly pointed, it does not matter how well the\r\nlashing is put on; therefore it is an invariable rule that lashings\r\nmust be pointed as carefully as possible. When I looked at this one,\r\nwhat do you think I saw? Why, the end of the lashing was nailed down\r\nwith a little tack, such as one would use to fasten labels. \"That\r\nwould be a nice thing to take to the Pole!\" This final observation\r\nof Hanssen's was doubtless the mildest expression of what he thought\r\nof the work. I saw how the new lashings were being put on, and I was\r\nquite ready to agree with Hanssen that they would do the work. It was,\r\nby the way, no easy job, this lashing at -15deg.F., as the thermometer\r\nshowed, but Hanssen did not seem to mind it.\r\n\r\nI had heard that Wisting also took part in this work, but he was\r\nnot to be seen. Where could he be? My eyes involuntarily sought the\r\ncurtain, behind which the humming sound was audible. I was now ready\r\nto burst with curiosity. At last the lashing question appears to be\r\nthrashed out, and my companion shows signs of moving on. He leaves\r\nhis lantern and goes up to the curtain. \"Wisting!\" -- \"Yes!\" The\r\nanswer seems to come from a far distance. The humming ceases, and the\r\ncurtain is thrust aside. Then I am confronted by the sight that has\r\nimpressed me most of all on this eventful day. There sits Wisting, in\r\nthe middle of the Barrier, working a sewing-machine. The temperature\r\noutside is now -60deg.F. This seems to me to require some explanation;\r\nI slink through the opening to get a closer view. Then -- ugh! I am\r\nmet by a regular tropical blast. I glance at the thermometer; it shows\r\n+50deg. F. But how can this be?  Here he is, sewing in an ice-cellar at\r\n+50deg.. I was told in my school-days that ice melts at about +32deg.. If\r\nthe same law is still in operation, he ought to be sitting in a\r\nshower-bath. I go right in; the sewing-room is not large, about 6 feet\r\neach way. Besides the sewing-machine -- a modern treadle-machine --\r\nthe room contains a number of instruments, compasses, and so forth,\r\nbesides the large tent he is now working on. But what interests me\r\nmost is the way in which he circumvents the shower-bath. I see it now;\r\nit is very cleverly contrived. He has covered the roof and walls with\r\ntin and canvas, so arranged that all the melting ice goes the same\r\nway, and runs into a wash-tub that stands below. In this manner he\r\ncollects washing water, which is such a precious commodity in these\r\nregions -- wily man! I afterwards hear that nearly all the outfit\r\nfor the Polar journey is being made in this little ice-cabin. Well,\r\nwith men like these I don't think Amundsen will deserve any credit\r\nfor reaching the Pole. He ought to be thrashed if he doesn't.\r\n\r\nNow we have finished here, and must in all probability have seen\r\neverything. My guide goes over to the wall where the clothing is lying\r\nand begins to rummage in it. A clothing inspection, I say to myself;\r\nthere's no great fun in that. I sit down on the pile of sledges by\r\nthe opposite wall, and am going over in my mind all I have seen,\r\nwhen suddenly he thrusts his head forward -- like a man who is going\r\nto make a dive -- and disappears among the bundles of skins. I jump\r\nup and make for the piles of clothing; I am beginning to feel quite\r\nlost in this mysterious world. In my hurry I collide with Hanssen's\r\nsledge, which falls off the table; he looks round furiously. It is a\r\ngood thing he could not see me; he looked like murder. I squeeze in\r\nbetween the bundles of clothing, and what do I see? Another hole in\r\nthe wall; another low, dark passage. I pluck up courage and plunge\r\nin. This tunnel is rather higher than the other, and I can walk,\r\nbending double. Fortunately, the light at the other end shows up at\r\nonce, so that my journey in the dark is not a long one this time. I\r\ncome out into another large room of about the same size as the last,\r\nand afterwards learn that it is known as the Crystal Palace. The name\r\nis appropriate, as crystals sparkle on every side. Against one wall\r\na number of pairs of ski are resting; elsewhere there are cases,\r\nsome yellow and some black. I guess the meaning of this at once,\r\nafter my visit to Stubberud. The yellow cases are the original ones,\r\nand the black the improved ones. They think of everything here. Of\r\ncourse, in snow black is a far better colour than light yellow; the\r\ncases will be pleasanter to look at, and very much easier to see at\r\na distance. And if they happen to run short of marks, all they need\r\ndo will be to break up a case and make as many black marks as they\r\nwant; they will be easily seen in the snow. The lids of these cases\r\nsurprise me. They are no bigger than ordinary large milk-can lids,\r\nand of the same form; they are loose, as with a milk-can, and are\r\nput on in the same way. Then it suddenly occurs to me. When I was\r\nsitting on the sledges in Hanssen's workshop, I noticed little pieces\r\nof wire rope fixed to both ribs of the sledge. There were eight of\r\nthem on each side -- just the right number. They are lashings for\r\nfour cases, and they will hardly take more than that on a sledge. On\r\none rib all the wire ropes ended in eyes; on the other they ended in\r\nthin lashings. Obviously there were four of them to each case -- two\r\nforward and two aft of the lid. If these were reeved and drawn taut,\r\nthe cases would be held as in a vice, and the lids could be taken\r\noff freely at any time. It was an ingenious idea, which would save\r\na lot of work.\r\n\r\nBut there sits Johansen in the middle of the Palace, packing. He\r\nseems to have a difficult problem to solve; he looks so profoundly\r\nthoughtful. Before him is a case half packed, marked \"Sledge No. V.,\r\nCase No. 4.\" More singular contents I have never seen -- a mixture\r\nof pemmican and sausage. I have never heard of sausages on a sledge\r\njourney; it must be something quite new. The pieces of pemmican\r\nare cylindrical in shape, about 2 inches high and 4 and 3/4 inches\r\nin diameter; when they are packed, there will be large star-shaped\r\nopenings between every four of them. Each of these openings is filled\r\nup with a sausage, which stands straight up and down, and is of\r\nexactly the height of the case. But sausage -- let me see. Ah! there's\r\na sausage with a tear in its skin; I run across and look at it. Oh,\r\nthe cunning rascals! if it isn't milk-powder they are smuggling in\r\nlike this! So every bit of space is utilized. The gaps left by these\r\nround pieces of pemmican at the sides of the cases are, of course,\r\nonly half as large as the rest, and so cannot take a milk-sausage; but\r\ndon't imagine that the space is wasted. No; chocolate is broken up into\r\nsmall pieces and stowed in there. When all these cases are packed,\r\nthey will be as full as if they were of solid wood. There is one\r\nready packed; I must see what it contains. Biscuits -- 5,400 biscuits\r\nis marked on the lid. They say that angels are specially gifted with\r\npatience, but theirs must be a trifle compared with Johansen's. There\r\nwas absolutely not a fraction of an inch left in that case.\r\n\r\nThe Crystal Palace at present reminds one strongly of a grocer's and\r\nchandler's store -- pemmican, biscuits, chocolate, and milk-sausage,\r\nlie about everywhere. In the other wall, opposite the ski, there is\r\nan opening. I see my companion making for it, but this time I intend\r\nto keep an eye on him. He goes up two steps, pushes a trap-door,\r\nand there he stands on the Barrier -- but I am there, too. The\r\ntrap-door is replaced, and I see that we are close to another door\r\nin the Barrier, but this is a modern sliding-door. It leads into\r\nthe clothing store. I turn to my host and give him my best thanks\r\nfor the interesting circular trip through the Barrier, expressing\r\nmy admiration of all the fine engineering works I have seen, and\r\nso on. He cuts me short with the remark that we are not nearly done\r\nyet. He has only brought me up this way to save my having to crawl\r\nback again. \"We are going in now,\" he adds, \"to continue our journey\r\nunder the surface.\" I see that there is no getting out of it, although\r\nI am beginning to have enough of these underground passages. My host\r\nseems to guess my thoughts, as he adds: \"We must see them now when the\r\nmen are working. Afterwards they will not have the same interest.\" I\r\nsee that he is right, pull myself together, and follow him.\r\n\r\nBut Fate wills it otherwise. As we come out on the Barrier, Hanssen\r\nis standing there with his sledge and six fresh dogs harnessed. My\r\ncompanion has just time to whisper to me, \" Jump on; I'll wait here,\"\r\nwhen the sledge starts off at a terrific pace with me as a passenger,\r\nunsuspected by Hanssen.\r\n\r\nWe went along so that the snow dashed over us. He had his dogs well\r\nin hand, this fellow, I could see that; but they were a wild lot of\r\nrascals he had to deal with. I heard the names of Hok and Togo in\r\nparticular; they seemed inclined for mischief. All of a sudden they\r\ndarted back on their companions under the traces, and got the whole\r\nteam in a tangle; but they were not able to do very much, as the\r\nwhip, which was wielded with great dexterity, constantly sang about\r\ntheir ears. The two sausages I had noticed on the slope -- Ring and\r\nMylius -- were leaders; they, too, were full of pranks, but kept their\r\nplaces. Hai and Rap were also in the team. Rap, whose ear was split,\r\nwould have liked very much to get his friend Hai to join in a little\r\nfight with Hok and Togo, but for the whip. It swished to and fro,\r\nin and out, among them without mercy, and made them behave like good\r\nboys. After us, some yards behind, came Zanko. He seemed to be put\r\nout because he had not been harnessed. Meanwhile we went at a gallop\r\nup the hill to the depot, and the last flag was passed. There was a\r\nmarked difference in the daylight here now. It was eleven o'clock, and\r\nthe flush of dawn had risen a good way in the sky and was approaching\r\nthe north. The numbers and marks on the cases were easily visible.\r\n\r\nHanssen drew up smartly by the rows of cases and halted. We stepped\r\noff the sledge. He stood still for a moment and looked round, then\r\nturned the sledge over, with the runners in the air. I supposed he\r\ndid this to prevent the dogs making off when his back was turned;\r\npersonally, I thought it was a poor safeguard. I jumped up on a case,\r\nand sat there to await what developments might come. And they came in\r\nthe form of Zanko. Hanssen had moved off a little way with a piece\r\nof paper in his hand, and seemed to be examining the cases as he\r\nwent along. Zanko had now reached his friends, Ring and Mylius,\r\nand the meeting was a very cordial one on both sides. This was\r\ntoo much for Hok; he was on to them like a rocket, followed by his\r\nfriend Togo. Hai and Rap never let such an opportunity escape them,\r\nand they eagerly flung themselves into the thick of the fight. \"Stop\r\nthat, you blackguards!\" It was Hanssen who threw this admonition in\r\nadvance, as he came rushing back. Zanko, who was free, had kept his\r\nhead sufficiently to observe the approaching danger; without much\r\nhesitation, he cut away and made for Framheim with all possible\r\nspeed. Whether the others missed their sixth combatant, or whether\r\nthey, too, became aware of Hanssen's threatening approach, I am unable\r\nto determine; certain it is that they all got clear of each other,\r\nas though at a given signal, and made off the same way. The capsized\r\nsledge made no difference to them; they went like the wind over the\r\nslope, and disappeared by the flagstaff. Hanssen did not take long to\r\nmake up his mind, but what was the use? He went as fast as he could,\r\nno doubt, but had reached no farther than to the flagstaff, when the\r\ndogs, with the capsized sledge behind them, ran into Framheim and\r\nwere stopped there.\r\n\r\nI went quietly back, well pleased with the additional experience. Down\r\non the level I met Hanssen on his way to the depot a second time;\r\nhe looked extremely angry, and the way in which he used the whip\r\ndid not promise well for the dogs' backs. Zanko was now harnessed in\r\nthe team. On my return to Framheim I saw no one, so I slipped into\r\nthe pent-house, and waited for an opportunity of getting into the\r\nkitchen. This was not long in coming. Puffing and gasping like a small\r\nlocomotive, Lindstrom swung in from the passage that led round the\r\nhouse. In his arms he again carried the big bucket full of ice, and an\r\nelectric lamp hung from his mouth. In order to open the kitchen-door,\r\nhe had only to give it a push with his knee; I slipped in. The house\r\nwas empty. Now, I thought, I shall have a good chance of seeing what\r\nLindstrom does when he is left alone. He put down the bucket of ice,\r\nand gradually filled up the water-pot which was on the fire. Then he\r\nlooked at the clock: a quarter-past eleven -- good; dinner will be\r\nready in time. He drew a long, deep sigh, then went into the room,\r\nfilled and lit his pipe. Thereupon he sat down and took up a doll\r\nthat was sitting on a letter-weight. His whole face lighted up; one\r\ncould see how pleased he was. He wound up the doll and put it on\r\nthe table; as soon as he let it go, it began to turn somersaults,\r\none after another, endlessly. And Lindstrom? Well, he laughed till\r\nhe must have been near convulsions, crying out all the while: \"That's\r\nright, Olava; go it again!\" I then looked at the doll carefully, and\r\nit was certainly something out of the common. The head was that of an\r\nold woman -- evidently a disagreeable old maid -- with yellow hair,\r\na hanging under-jaw, and a love-sick expression. She wore a dress of\r\nred-and-white check, and when she turned head over heels it caused,\r\nas might be expected, some disturbance of her costume. The figure,\r\none could see, had originally been an acrobat, but these ingenious\r\nPolar explorers had transformed it into this hideous shape. When the\r\nexperiment was repeated, and I understood the situation, I could not\r\nhelp roaring, too, but Lindstrom was so deeply occupied that he did\r\nnot hear me. After amusing himself for about ten minutes with this,\r\nhe got tired of Olava, and put her up on the weight again. She sat\r\nthere nodding and bowing until she was forgotten.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lindstrom had gone to his bunk, and was lying half in\r\nit. Now, I thought to myself, he is going to take a little nap before\r\ndinner. But no; he came out again at once, holding a tattered old\r\npack of cards in his hand. He went back to his place, and began a\r\nquiet and serious game of patience. It did not take long, and was\r\nprobably not very complicated, but it served its purpose. One could\r\nsee what a pleasure it was to him whenever a card came in its right\r\nplace. Finally, all the cards were in order; he had finished the\r\ngame. He sat a little while longer, enjoying the sight of the finished\r\npacks; then he picked them all up with a sigh, and rose, mumbling:\r\n\"Yes, he'll get to the Pole, that's sure; and, what's more, he'll\r\nget there first.\" He put the cards back on the shelf in his bunk,\r\nand looked well pleased with himself.\r\n\r\nThen the process of laying the table began once more, but with far\r\nless noise than in the morning; there was nobody to be annoyed by it\r\nnow. At five minutes to twelve a big ship's bell was rung, and not\r\nlong after the diners began to arrive. They did not make any elaborate\r\ntoilet, but sat down to table at once. The dishes were not many:\r\na thick, black seal soup, with all manner of curious things in it --\r\nseal meat cut into \" small dice\" is no doubt the expression, but it\r\nwould be misleading here; \"large dice\" we had better call them --\r\nwith potatoes, carrots, cabbage, turnips, peas, celery, prunes, and\r\napples. I should like to know what our cooks at home would call that\r\ndish. Two large jugs of syrup and water stood on the table. Now I had\r\nanother surprise; I was under the impression that a dinner like this\r\npassed off in silence, but that was by no means the case here. They\r\ntalked the whole time, and the conversation chiefly turned on what\r\nthey had been doing during the forenoon. For dessert they had some\r\ngreen plums. Pipes and books soon made their appearance.\r\n\r\nBy about two o'clock the boys gave fresh signs of life. I knew they\r\nwere not going to work that afternoon -- St. Hans' Eve -- but habit\r\nis a strange thing. Bjaaland rose in a peremptory fashion, and asked\r\nwho was going to have the first turn. After a lot of questions and\r\nanswers, it was decided that Hassel should be the first. What it was\r\nI could not make out. I heard them talk about one or two Primuses,\r\nand say that half an hour was the most one could stand, but that did\r\nnot mean anything to me. I should have to stick to Hassel; he was\r\ngoing first. If there should be no second man, I should, at any rate,\r\nhave seen what the first one did. Everything became quiet again; it was\r\nonly in the kitchen that one could tell that the Barrier was inhabited.\r\n\r\nAt half-past two Bjaaland, who had been out, came in and announced\r\nthat now it was all a mass of steam. I watched Hassel anxiously. Yes;\r\nthis announcement seemed to put life into him. He got up and began\r\nto undress. Very strange, I thought; what can this be? I tried the\r\nSherlock Holmes method -- first Bjaaland goes out; that is fact number\r\none. Then he comes back; that I could also make sure of. So far the\r\nmethod worked well. But then comes the third item \"It is all a mass of\r\nsteam.\" What in the world does that mean? The man has gone out -- if\r\nnot out on to the Barrier, then certainly into it -- into snow-ice, and\r\nthen he comes back and says that it is all a mass of steam. It seems\r\nridiculous -- absurd. I send Sherlock Holmes to the deuce, and watch\r\nHassel with increasing excitement; if he takes any more off -- I felt\r\nI was blushing, and half turned my head, but there he stopped. Then\r\nhe picked up a towel, and away we went: out through the pent-house\r\ndoor -- it was all I could do to follow him -- along the snow tunnel\r\nin nothing but -- Here steam really began to meet us, getting thicker\r\nand thicker as we came into the Barrier. The tunnel became so full of\r\nsteam that I could see nothing. I thought with longing of the tail\r\nof Amundsen's anorak that was so useful on such occasions, but here\r\nthere was nothing to take hold of. Far away in the fog I could see a\r\nlight, and made my way to it with caution. Before I knew where I was,\r\nI stood at the other end of the passage, which led into a large room,\r\ncovered with rime, and closed overhead by a mighty dome of ice. The\r\nsteam was troublesome, and spoilt my view of the room. But what had\r\nbecome of Hassel? I could only see Bjaaland. Then suddenly the fog\r\nseemed to clear for an instant, and I caught sight of a bare leg\r\ndisappearing into a big black box, and a moment later I saw Hassel's\r\nsmiling face on the top of the box. A shudder passed through my frame\r\n-- he looked as if he had been decapitated. On further consideration,\r\nhis features were too smiling; the head could not be severed from the\r\nbody yet. Now the steam began to clear away little by little, and at\r\nlast one could see clearly what was going on. I had to laugh; it was\r\nall very easy to understand now. But I think Sherlock Holmes would\r\nhave found it a hard-nut to crack if he had been set down blindfold\r\non the Antarctic Barrier, as I was, so to speak, and asked to explain\r\nthe situation. It was one of those folding American vapour-baths that\r\nHassel sat in. The bathroom, which had looked so spacious and elegant\r\nin the fog, reduced itself to a little snow-hut of insignificant\r\nappearance. The steam was now collected in the bath, and one could\r\nsee by the face above that it was beginning to be warm there. The last\r\nthing I saw Bjaaland do was to pump two Primus lamps that were placed\r\njust under the bath up to high pressure, and then disappear. What\r\na lesson an actor might have had in watching the face before me! It\r\nbegan with such a pleasant expression -- well-being was written upon\r\nit in the brightest characters -- then by degrees the smile wore off,\r\nand gave place to seriousness. But this did not last long; there was\r\na trembling of the nostrils, and very soon it could clearly be seen\r\nthat the bath was no longer of a pleasant nature. The complexion,\r\nfrom being normal, had changed to an ultra-violet tint; the eyes\r\nopened wider and wider, and I was anxiously awaiting a catastrophe.\r\n\r\nIt came, but in a very different form from that I had\r\nexpected. Suddenly and noiselessly the bath was raised, and the steam\r\npoured out, laying a soft white curtain over what followed. I could\r\nsee nothing; only heard that the two Primuses were turned down. I\r\nthink it took about five minutes for the steam to disappear, and\r\nwhat did I see then? -- Hassel, bright as a new shilling, dressed in\r\nhis best for St. Hans' Eve. I availed myself of the opportunity to\r\nexamine the first, and probably the only, vapour-bath on the Antarctic\r\nBarrier. It was, like everything else I had seen, very ingeniously\r\ncontrived. The bath was a high box without bottom, and with a hole,\r\nlarge enough for the head, in the top. Ail the walls were double and\r\nwere made of windproof material, with about an inch between for the\r\nair to circulate. This box stood on a platform, which was raised a\r\ncouple of feet above the snow surface. The box fitted into a groove,\r\nand was thus absolutely tight. In the platform immediately under the\r\nbath a rectangular opening was cut, lined round with rubber packing,\r\nand into this opening a tin box fitted accurately. Under the tin box\r\nstood two Primus lamps, and now everyone will be able to understand why\r\nHassel felt warm. A block hung from the top of the hut, with a rope\r\nreeved in it; one end was made fast to the upper edge of the bath,\r\nand the other went down into the bath. In this way the bather himself\r\ncould raise the bath without assistance, and free himself when the\r\nheat became too great. The temperature outside the snow-wall was -65deg.\r\nF. Cunning lads! I afterwards heard that Bjaaland and Hassel had\r\nconstructed this ingenious bath.\r\n\r\nI now went back to the house, and saw how they all -- almost -- made\r\nuse of the vapour-bath. By a quarter-past five all the bathing was\r\nconcluded, and everyone put on his furs; it was evident that they\r\nwere going out. I followed the first man who left the hut; he was\r\nprovided with a lantern, and indeed it was wanted. The weather had\r\nchanged: a south-west wind had sprung up suddenly, and now the air\r\nwas thick with snow. It was not a fall of snow, for one could see\r\nthe stars in the zenith, but snow caught up by the wind and whirled\r\nalong. A man had to know the surroundings well to find his way now;\r\none had to feel -- it was impossible to keep one's eyes open. I took\r\nup a position in lee of a snow-drift, and waited to see what would\r\nhappen. The dogs did not seem to be inconvenienced by the change of\r\nweather; some of them lay curled up in a ring, with their nose under\r\ntheir tail, on the snow, while others were running about. One by one\r\nthe men came out; each had a lantern in his hand. As they arrived at\r\nthe place where the dogs were, each was surrounded by his team, who\r\nfollowed him to the tents with joyous howls. But everything did not\r\npass off peacefully; I heard -- I think it was in Bjaaland's tent --\r\na deafening noise going on, and looked in at the door. Down there,\r\ndeep below the surface, they were having a warm time. All the dogs\r\nwere mixed up together in one mass: some were biting, some shrieking,\r\nsome howling. In the midst of this mass of raging dogs I saw a human\r\nfigure swinging round, with a bunch of dog-collars in one hand, while\r\nhe dealt blows right and left with the other, and blessed the dogs all\r\nthe time. I thought of my calves and withdrew. But the human figure\r\nthat I had seen evidently won the mastery, as the noise gradually\r\nsubsided and all became quiet. As each man got his dogs tied up, he\r\nwent over to the meat-tent and took a box of cut-up seal meat, which\r\nstood on the wall out of the dogs' reach. This meat had been cut up\r\nearlier in the day by two men. They took it in turns, I heard; two men\r\nhad this duty daily. The dogs were then fed, and half an hour after\r\nthis was done the camp again lay as I had found it in the morning,\r\nquiet and peaceful. With a temperature of -65deg. F., and a velocity of\r\ntwenty-two miles an hour, the south-wester swept over the Barrier, and\r\nwhirled the snow high into the air above Framheim; but in their tents\r\nthe dogs lay, full-fed and contented, and felt nothing of the storm.\r\n\r\nIn the hut preparations for a feast were going on, and now one could\r\nreally appreciate a good house. The change from the howling wind,\r\nthe driving snow, the intense cold, and the absolute darkness,\r\nwas great indeed when one came in. Everything was newly washed,\r\nand the table was gaily decorated. Small Norwegian flags were\r\neverywhere, on the table and walls. The festival began at six, and\r\nall the \"vikings\" came merrily in. Lindstrom had done his best, and\r\nthat is not saying a little. I specially admired his powers and his\r\nliberality -- and I think, even in the short time I have observed him,\r\nhe has shown no sign of being stingy -- when he appeared with the\r\n\"Napoleon\" cakes. Now I must tell you that these cakes were served\r\nafter every man had put away a quarter of a plum-pudding. The cakes\r\nwere delightful to look at -- the finest puff-pastry, with layers of\r\nvanilla custard and cream. They made my mouth water. But the size of\r\nthem! -- there could not be one of those mountains of cake to every\r\nman? One among them all, perhaps -- if they could be expected to eat\r\nNapoleon cakes at all after plum-pudding. But why had he brought in\r\neight -- two enormous dishes with four on each? Good heavens! --\r\none of the vikings had just started, and was making short work of\r\nhis mountain. And one after another they all walked into them, until\r\nthe whole eight had disappeared. I should have nothing to say about\r\nhunger, misery, and cold, when I came hone. My head was going round;\r\nthe temperature must have been as many degrees above zero in here\r\nas it was below zero outside. I looked up at Wisting's bunk, where\r\na thermometer was hanging: +95deg. F. The vikings did not seem to take\r\nthe slightest notice of this trifle; their work with the \"Napoleons\"\r\ncontinued undisturbed.\r\n\r\nSoon the gorgeous cake was a thing of the past, and cigars came\r\nout. Everyone, without exception, allowed himself this luxury. Up\r\nto now they had not shown much sign of abstinence; I wanted to know\r\nwhat was their attitude with regard to strong drinks. I had heard,\r\nof course, that indulgence in alcohol on Polar expeditions was very\r\nharmful, not to say dangerous. \"Poor boys!\" I thought to myself; \"that\r\nmust be the reason of your fondness for cake. A man must have one vice,\r\nat least. Deprived of the pleasure of drinking, they make up for it in\r\ngluttony.\" Yes, now I could see it quite plainly, and I was heartily\r\nsorry for them. I wondered how the \"Napoleons\" felt now; they looked\r\nrather depressed. No doubt the cake took some time to settle down.\r\n\r\nLindstrom, who now seemed unquestionably the most wideawake of them\r\nall, came in and began to clear the table. I expected to see every\r\nman roll into his bunk to digest. But no; that side of the question\r\ndid not appear to trouble them much. They remained seated, as though\r\nexpecting more. Oh yes, of course; there was coffee to come. Lindstrom\r\nwas already in the doorway with cups and jugs. A cup of coffee would\r\nbe just the thing after such a meal.\r\n\r\n\"Stubberud!\" -- this was Lindstrom's voice, calling from some\r\nplace in the far distance -- \"hurry up, before they get warm!\" I\r\nrushed after Stubberud to see what the things were that were not\r\nto get warm; I thought it might possibly be something that was to\r\nbe taken outside. Great Heaven! there was Lindstrom lying on his\r\nstomach up in the loft, and handing down through the trap-door --\r\nwhat do you think? -- a bottle of Benedictine and a bottle of punch,\r\nboth white with frost! Now I could see that the fish were to swim --\r\nwhat's more, they were to be drowned. A happier smile than that with\r\nwhich Stubberud received the bottles, or more careful and affectionate\r\nhandling than they received on their way through the kitchen, I have\r\nnever seen. I was touched. Ah, these boys knew how a liqueur should\r\nbe served! \"Must be served cold,\" was on the label of the punch\r\nbottle. I can assure P. A. Larsen that his prescription was followed\r\nto the letter that evening. Then the gramophone made its appearance,\r\nand it did me good to see the delight with which it was received. They\r\nseemed to like this best, after all, and every man had music to suit\r\nhis taste. All agreed to honour the cook for all his pains, and the\r\nconcert therefore began with \"Tarara-boom-de-ay,\" followed by the\r\n\"Apache\" waltz. His part of the programme was concluded with a humorous\r\nrecitation. Meanwhile he stood in the doorway with a beatific smile;\r\nthis did him good. In this way the music went the round, and all\r\nhad their favourite tunes. Certain numbers were kept to the last; I\r\ncould see that they were to the taste of all. First came an air from\r\n\"The Huguenots,\" sung by Michalowa; this showed the vikings to be\r\nmusical. It was beautifully sung. \"But look here,\" cried an impatient\r\nvoice: \"aren't we going to have Borghild Bryhn to-night?\" \"Yes,\" was\r\nthe answer; \"here she comes.\" And Solveig's Song followed. It was\r\na pity Borghild Bryhn was not there; I believe the most rapturous\r\napplause would not have moved her so much as the way her song was\r\nreceived here that evening. As the notes rang clear and pure through\r\nthe room, one could see the faces grow serious. No doubt the words of\r\nthe poem affected them all as they sat there in the dark winter night\r\non the vast wilderness of ice, thousands and thousands of miles from\r\nall that was dear to them. I think that was so; but it was the lovely\r\nmelody, given with perfect finish and rich natural powers, that opened\r\ntheir hearts. One could see how it did them good; it was as though\r\nthey were afraid of the sound of their own voices afterwards. At last\r\none of them could keep silence no longer. \"My word, how beautifully\r\nshe sings!\" he exclaimed; \"especially the ending. I was a little bit\r\nafraid that she would give the last note too sharp, in spite of the\r\nmasterly way in which she controls her voice. And it is outrageously\r\nhigh, too. But instead of that, the note came so pure and soft and full\r\nthat it alone was enough to make a better man of one.\" And then this\r\nenthusiastic listener tells them how he once heard the same song,\r\nbut with a very different result. \"It went quite well,\" he says,\r\n\"until it came to the final note. Then you could see the singer fill\r\nher mighty bosom for the effort, and out came a note so shrill that --\r\nwell, you remember the walls of Jericho.\" After this the gramophone\r\nis put away. No one seems to want any more.\r\n\r\nNow it is already half-past eight, it must be nearly bed-time. The\r\nfeast has lasted long enough, with food, drink, and music. Then they\r\nall get on their feet, and there is a cry of \"Bow and arrows.\" Now,\r\nI say to myself, as I withdraw into the corner where the clothes\r\nare hanging -- now the alcohol is beginning to take effect. It is\r\nevident that something extraordinarily interesting is going to take\r\nplace, as they are all so active. One of them goes behind the door\r\nand fetches out a little cork target, and another brings out of his\r\nbunk a box of darts. So it is dart-throwing -- the children must be\r\namused. The target is hung up on the door of the kitchen leading\r\nto the pent-house, and the man who is to throw first takes up his\r\nposition at the end of the table at a distance of three yards. And\r\nnow the shooting competition begins, amid laughter and noise. There\r\nare marksmen of all kinds, good, bad, and indifferent. Here comes\r\nthe champion -- one can see that by the determined way in which he\r\nraises the dart and sends it flying; his will, no doubt, be the top\r\nscore. That is Stubberud; of the five darts he throws, two are in the\r\nbull's-eye and three close to it. The next is Johansen; he is not bad,\r\neither, but does not equal the other's score. Then comes Bjaaland; I\r\nwonder whether he is as smart at this game as he is on ski? He places\r\nhimself at the end of the table, like the others, but takes a giant's\r\nstride forward. He is a leery one, this; now he is not more than a\r\nyard and a half from the target. He throws well; the darts describe\r\na great round arch. This is what is known as throwing \"with a high\r\ntrajectory,\" and it is received with great applause. The trajectory\r\nturns out to be too high, and all his darts land in the wall above\r\nthe door. Hassel throws with \"calculation.\" What he calculates it\r\nis not easy to understand. Not on hitting the target, apparently;\r\nbut if his calculations have to do with the kitchen-door, then they\r\nare more successful. Whether Amundsen \"calculates\" or not makes very\r\nlittle difference; his are all misses in any case. Wisting's form is\r\nthe same. Prestrud is about half-way between the good shots and the\r\nbad. Hanssen throws like a professional, slinging his dart with great\r\nforce. He evidently thinks he is hunting walrus. All the scores are\r\ncarefully entered in a book, and prizes will be given later on.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lindstrom is playing patience; his day's work is now\r\ndone. But, besides his cards, he is much interested in what is going\r\non round the target, and puts in a good word here and there. Then he\r\ngets up with a determined look; he has one more duty to perform. This\r\nconsists of changing the light from the big lamp under the ceiling\r\nto two small lamps, and the reason for the change is that the heat\r\nof the big lamp would be too strongly felt in the upper bunks. This\r\noperation is a gentle hint that the time has come for certain people to\r\nturn in. The room looks dark now that the great sun under the ceiling\r\nis extinguished; the two lamps that are now alight are good enough,\r\nbut one seems, nevertheless, to have made a retrograde step towards\r\nthe days of pine-wood torches.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, then, the vikings began to retire to rest. My description\r\nof the day's life at Framheim would be incomplete if I did not include\r\nthis scene in it. Lindstrom's chief pride, I had been told, was that\r\nhe was always the first man in bed; he would willingly sacrifice\r\na great deal to hold this record. As a rule, he had no difficulty\r\nin fulfilling his desire, as nobody tried to be before him; but\r\nthis evening it was otherwise. Stubberud was far advanced with his\r\nundressing when Lindstrom came in, and, seeing a chance at last of\r\nbeing \"first in bed,\" at once challenged the cook. Lindstrom, who did\r\nnot quite grasp the situation, accepted the challenge, and then the\r\nrace began, and was followed by the others with great excitement. Now\r\nStubberud is ready, and is just going to jump into his bunk, which\r\nis over Lindstrom's, when he suddenly feels himself clutched by the\r\nleg and held back. Lindstrom hangs on to the leg with all his force,\r\ncrying out, in the most pitiable voice: \"Wait a bit, old man, till\r\nI'm undressed too!\" It reminded me rather of the man who was going to\r\nfight, and called out: \"Wait till I get a hold of you!\" But the other\r\nwas not to be persuaded; he was determined to win. Then Lindstrom let\r\ngo, tore off his braces -- he had no time for more -- and dived head\r\nfirst into his bunk. Stubberud tried to protest; this was not fair,\r\nhe was not undressed, and so on.\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't matter,\" replied the fat man; \"I was first, all the\r\nsame.\"\r\n\r\nThe scene was followed with great amusement and shouts of\r\nencouragement, and ended in a storm of applause when Lindstrom\r\ndisappeared into his bunk with his clothes on. But that was not the\r\nend of the business, for his leap into the bunk was followed by a\r\nfearful crash, to which no one paid any attention in the excitement\r\nof the moment, himself least of all. But now the consequences\r\nappeared. The shelf along the side of his bunk, on which he kept a\r\nlarge assortment of things, had fallen down, and filled the bunk with\r\nrifles, ammunition, gramophone-discs, tool-boxes, sweetmeat-boxes,\r\npipes, tins of tobacco, ash-trays, boxes of matches, etc., and there\r\nwas no room left for the man himself. He had to get out again, and\r\nhis defeat was doubly hard. With shame he acknowledged Stubberud as\r\nthe victor; \"but,\" he added, \"you shan't be first another time.\" One\r\nby one the others turned in; books were produced -- here and there a\r\npipe as well -- and in this way the last hour was passed. At eleven\r\no'clock precisely the lamps were put out, and the day was at an end.\r\n\r\nSoon after, my host goes to the door, and I follow him out. I had\r\ntold him I had to leave again this evening, and he is going to see me\r\noff. \"I'll take you as far as the depot,\" he says; \"the rest of the way\r\nyou can manage by yourself.\" The weather has improved considerably,\r\nbut it is dark -- horribly dark. \"So that we may find the way more\r\neasily,\" he says, \"I'll take my trio. If they don't see the way,\r\nthey'll smell it out.\" Having let loose the three dogs, who evidently\r\nwonder what the meaning of it may be, he puts a lantern on a stack of\r\ntimber -- to show him the way back, I suppose -- and we go off. The\r\ndogs are evidently accustomed to go this way, for they set off at\r\nonce in the direction of the depot.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" says my companion, \"it's not to be wondered at that they know\r\nthe way. They have gone it every day -- once at least, often two or\r\nthree times -- since we came here. There are three of us who always\r\ntake our daily walk in this direction -- Bjaaland, Stubberud, and I. As\r\nyou saw this morning, those two went out at half-past eight. They did\r\nthat so as to be back to work at nine. We have so much to do that we\r\ncan't afford to lose any time. So they take their walk to the depot\r\nand back; at nine I generally do the same. The others began the winter\r\nwith the same good resolution; they were all so enthusiastic for a\r\nmorning walk. But the enthusiasm didn't last long, and now we three\r\nare the only enthusiasts left. But, short as the way is -- about\r\n650 yards -- we should not venture to go without those marks that\r\nyou saw, and without our dogs. I have often hung out a lantern, too;\r\nbut when it is as cold as this evening, the paraffin freezes and the\r\nlight goes out. Losing one's way here might be a very serious matter,\r\nand I don't want to run the risk of it.\r\n\r\n\" Here we have the first mark-post; we were lucky to come straight upon\r\nit. The dogs are on ahead, making for the depot. Another reason for\r\nbeing very careful on the way to the depot is that there is a big hole,\r\n20 feet deep, just by a hummock on that slope where, you remember, the\r\nlast flag stands. If one missed one's way and fell into it, one might\r\nget hurt.\" We passed close to the second mark. \"The next two marks are\r\nmore difficult to hit off -- they are so low; and I often wait and\r\ncall the dogs to me to find the way -- as I am going to do now, for\r\ninstance. It is impossible to see anything unless you come right on it,\r\nso we must wait and let the dogs help us. I know exactly the number\r\nof paces between each mark, and when I have gone that number, I stop\r\nand first examine the ground close by. If that is no good, I whistle\r\nfor the dogs, who come at once. Now you'll see\" -- a long whistle --\r\n\"it won't be long before they are here. I can hear them already.\" He\r\nwas right; the dogs came running out of the darkness straight towards\r\nus. \"To let them see that we want to find the way to the depot,\r\nwe must begin to walk on.\" We did so. As soon as the dogs saw this,\r\nthey went forward again, but this time at a pace that allowed us to\r\nkeep up with them at a trot, and soon after we were at the last mark.\r\n\r\n\"As you see, my lantern over at the camp is just going out, so I\r\nhope you will excuse my accompanying you farther. You know your way,\r\nanyhow.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words we parted, and my host went back, followed by the\r\nfaithful trio, whilst I ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nThe End of the Winter\r\n\r\nAfter Midwinter Day the time began to pass even more quickly than\r\nbefore. The darkest period was over, and the sun was daily drawing\r\nnearer. In the middle of the darkest time, Hassel came in one morning\r\nand announced that Else had eight puppies. Six of these were ladies,\r\nso their fate was sealed at once; they were killed and given to their\r\nelder relations, who appreciated them highly. It could hardly be seen\r\nthat they chewed them at all; they went down practically whole. There\r\ncould be no doubt of their approval, as the next day the other two\r\nhad also disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe weather conditions we encountered down here surprised us\r\ngreatly. In every quarter of the Antarctic regions of which we had\r\nany information, the conditions had always proved very unsettled. On\r\nthe Belgica, in the drift-ice to the west of Graham Land, we always\r\nhad rough, unpleasant weather. Nordenskjold's stay in the regions to\r\nthe east of the same land gave the same report -- storm after storm\r\nthe whole time. And from the various English expeditions that have\r\nvisited McMurdo Sound we hear of continual violent winds. Indeed,\r\nwe know now that while we were living on the Barrier in the most\r\nsplendid weather -- calms or light breezes -- Scott at his station\r\nsome four hundred miles to the west of us was troubled by frequent\r\nstorms, which greatly hindered his work.\r\n\r\nI had expected the temperature to remain high, as throughout the winter\r\nwe could very clearly see the dark sky over the sea. Whenever the state\r\nof the air was favourable, the dark, heavy water-sky was visible in a\r\nmarked degree, leaving no doubt that a large extent of Ross Sea was\r\nopen the whole year round. Nevertheless, the temperature went very\r\nlow, and without doubt the mean temperature shown by our observations\r\nfor the year is the lowest that has ever been recorded. Our lowest\r\ntemperature, on August 13, 1911, was -74.2deg.F. For five months of the\r\nyear we were able to record temperatures below -58deg.F. The temperature\r\nrose with every wind, except the south-west; with that it more usually\r\nwent down.\r\n\r\nWe observed the aurora australis many times, but only a few of its\r\nappearances were specially powerful. They were of all possible forms,\r\nthough the form of ribbon-like bands seemed to be commonest. Most of\r\nthe aurorae were multicoloured -- red and green.\r\n\r\nMy hypothesis of the solidity of the Barrier -- that is, of its resting\r\nupon underlying land -- seems to be confirmed at all points by our\r\nobservations during our twelve months' stay on it. In the course of\r\nthe winter and spring the pack-ice is forced up against the Barrier\r\ninto pressure-ridges of as much as 40 feet in height. This took place\r\nonly about a mile and a quarter from our hut, without our noticing\r\nits effect in the slightest degree. In my opinion, if this Barrier had\r\nbeen afloat, the effect of the violent shock which took place at its\r\nedge would not merely have been noticeable, but would have shaken our\r\nhouse. While building the house, Stubberud and Bjaaland heard a loud\r\nnoise a long way off, but could feel nothing. During our whole stay\r\nwe never heard a sound or felt a movement on this spot. Another very\r\ngood proof seems to be afforded by the large theodolite that Prestrud\r\nused. It would take next to nothing to disturb its level -- a slight\r\nchange of temperature might be enough. So delicate an instrument\r\nwould have soon shown an inclination if the Barrier had been afloat.\r\n\r\nThe day we entered the bay for the first time, a small piece of its\r\nwestern cape broke away. During the spring the drift-ice pressed in\r\nan insignificant part of one of the many points on the outer edge of\r\nthe Barrier. With these exceptions, we left the Barrier as we found\r\nit, entirely unaltered. The soundings, which showed a rapid rise\r\nin the bottom as the Fram changed her position southward along the\r\nBarrier, are also a clear sign that land is close at hand. Finally,\r\nthe formations of the Barrier appear to be the best proof. It could not\r\nrise to 1,100 feet -- which we measured as the rise from Framheim to\r\na point about thirty-one miles to the south -- without subjacent land.\r\n\r\nWork now proceeded on the sledging outfit with feverish haste. We had\r\nfor a long time been aware that we should have to do our utmost and\r\nmake the best use of our time if we were to have the general outfit\r\nfor our common use ready by the middle of August. For preparing our\r\npersonal outfit we had to use our leisure time. By the first half\r\nof August we could begin to see the end of our labour. Bjaaland had\r\nnow finished the four sledges. It was a masterly piece of work that\r\nhe had carried out in the course of the winter; they were extremely\r\nlightly constructed, but very strong. They were of the same length as\r\nthe original sledges -- about 12 feet -- and were not shod. We should\r\nhave a couple of the old Fram sledges with us, and these were shod\r\nwith strong steel plates, so that they could be used if the surface\r\nand going rendered it necessary. The average weight of the new sledges\r\nwas 53 pounds. We had thus saved as much as 110 pounds per sledge.\r\n\r\nWhen Bjaaland had finished them, they were taken into the \"Clothing\r\nStore.\" The way in which Hanssen and Wisting lashed the various parts\r\ntogether was a guarantee of their soundness; in fact, the only way in\r\nwhich one can expect work to be properly and carefully carried out is\r\nto have it done by the very men who are to use the things. They know\r\nwhat is at stake. They do it so that they may reach their destination;\r\nmore than that, they do it so that they may come back again. Every\r\npiece of binding is first carefully examined and tested; then it\r\nis put on, cautiously and accurately. Every turn is hauled taut,\r\ntaking care that it is in its right place. And, finally, the lashing\r\nis pointed in such a way that one would do best to use a knife or an\r\naxe if it has to be undone again; there is no danger of jerking it\r\nout with the fingers. A sledge journey of the kind we had before us\r\nis a serious undertaking, and the work has to be done seriously.\r\n\r\nIt was no warm and comfortable workshop that they had for doing\r\nthis. The Clothing Store was always the coldest place, probably because\r\nthere was always a draught through it. There was a door out on to\r\nthe Barrier, and an open passage leading to the house. Fresh air was\r\nconstantly passing through, though not in any very great quantity;\r\nbut it does not take much to make itself felt when the air is at\r\na temperature of about -75deg.F., and when one is working with bare\r\nfingers. There were always some degrees of frost here. In order to\r\nkeep the lashings pliable while they were being put on, they used\r\na Primus lamp on a stone close to where they were working. I often\r\nadmired their patience when I stood watching them; I have seen them\r\nmore than once working barehanded by the hour together in a temperature\r\nof about -22deg.F. This may pass for a short time; but through the coldest\r\nand darkest part of the winter, working day after day, as they did,\r\nit is pretty severe, and a great trial of patience. Nor were their\r\nfeet very well off either; it makes hardly any difference what one\r\nputs on them if one has to stay still. Here, as elsewhere in the cold,\r\nit was found that boots with wooden soles were the best for sedentary\r\nwork; but for some reason or other the occupants of the Clothing\r\nStore would not give their adherence to the wooden-sole principle,\r\nand continued to work all through the winter in their reindeer-skin\r\nand sealskin boots. They preferred stamping their feet to acknowledging\r\nthe incontestable superiority of wooden soles in such conditions.\r\n\r\nAs the sledges were finished, they were numbered from one to seven,\r\nand stored in the clothing department. The three old sledges we should\r\nhave to use were made for the Fram's second expedition. They were\r\nextremely strong, and, of course, heavier than the new ones. They were\r\nall carefully overhauled; all the bindings and lashings were examined,\r\nand replaced wherever necessary. The steel shoes were taken off one,\r\nbut retained on the other two, in case we should meet with conditions\r\nwhere they would be required.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this work of lashing, these two had plenty of other\r\noccupation. Whenever Wisting was not taken up by the work on the\r\nsledges, one could hear the hum of his sewing-machine. He had\r\na thousand different things to do in his sewing-room, and was in\r\nthere nearly every day till late in the evening. It was only when the\r\ntarget and darts came out at half-past eight that he showed himself,\r\nand if it had not been that he had undertaken the position of marker\r\nat these competitions, we should hardly have seen him even then. His\r\nfirst important piece of work was making four three-man tents into\r\ntwo. It was not easy to manage these rather large tents in the little\r\nhole that went by the name of the sewing-room; of course, he used\r\nthe table in the Clothing Store for cutting out, but, all the same,\r\nit is a mystery how he contrived to get hold of the right seams when\r\nhe sat in his hole. I was prepared to see the most curious-looking\r\ntents when once they were brought out and set up in daylight; one\r\nmight imagine that the floor of one would be sewed on to the side of\r\nanother. But nothing of the sort happened. When the tents were brought\r\nout for the first time and set up, they proved to be perfect. One\r\nwould have thought they had been made in a big sail-loft instead of\r\nin a snow-drift. Neat-fingered fellows like this are priceless on\r\nsuch an expedition as ours.\r\n\r\nOn the second Fram expedition they used double tents, and as, of\r\ncourse, nothing is so good and serviceable as the thing one has not\r\ngot, the praises of double tents were now sung in every key. Well,\r\nI naturally had to admit that a house with double walls is warmer\r\nthan one with single walls, but, at the same time, one must not lose\r\nsight of the fact that the double-walled house is also twice as heavy;\r\nand when one has to consider the weight of a pocket-handkerchief,\r\nit will be understood that the question of the real advantages of\r\nthe double-walled house had to be thoroughly considered before taking\r\nthe step of committing oneself to it. I had thought that with double\r\nwalls one would possibly avoid some of the rime that is generally so\r\ntroublesome in the tents, and often becomes a serious matter. If,\r\nthen, the double walls would in any way prevent or improve this\r\ncondition of things, I could see the advantage of having them; for\r\nthe increased weight caused by the daily deposit of rime would in a\r\nshort time be equal to, if not greater than, the additional weight\r\nof the double tent. These double tents are made so that the outer\r\ntent is fast and the inner loose. In the course of our discussion,\r\nit appeared that the deposit of rime occurred just as quickly on a\r\ndouble tent as on a single one, and thus the utility of the double\r\ntent appeared to me to be rather doubtful. If the object was merely\r\nto have it a few degrees warmer in the tent, I thought it best to\r\nsacrifice this comfort to the weight we should thereby save. Moreover,\r\nwe were so plentifully supplied with warm sleeping things that we\r\nshould not have to suffer any hardship.\r\n\r\nBut another question cropped up as a result of this discussion --\r\nthe question of what was the most useful colour for a tent. We were\r\nsoon agreed that a dark-coloured tent was best, for several reasons:\r\nIn the first place, as a relief to the eyes. We knew well enough what a\r\ncomfort it would be to come into a dark tent after travelling all day\r\non the glistening Barrier surface. In the next place, the dark colour\r\nwould make the tent a good deal warmer when the sun was up -- another\r\nimportant consideration. One may easily prove this by walking in dark\r\nclothes in a hot sun, and afterwards changing to white ones. And,\r\nfinally, a dark tent would be far easier to see on the white surface\r\nthan a light one. When all these questions had been discussed, and\r\nthe superiority of a dark tent admitted, we were doubly keen on it,\r\nsince all our tents happened to be light, not to say white, and the\r\npossibility of getting dark ones was not very apparent. It is true\r\nthat we had a few yards of darkish \" gabardine,\" or light windproof\r\nmaterial, which would have been extremely suitable for this purpose,\r\nbut every yard of it had long ago been destined for some other use,\r\nso that did not get us out of the difficulty. \"But,\" said somebody --\r\nand he had a very cunning air as he uttered that \"but\" -- \"but haven't\r\nwe got ink and ink-powder that we can dye our tents dark with?\" Yes,\r\nof course! We all smiled indulgently; the thing was so plain that\r\nit was almost silly to mention it, but all the same -- the man was\r\nforgiven his silliness, and dye-works were established. Wisting\r\naccepted the position of dyer, in addition to his other duties, and\r\nsucceeded so well that before very long we had two dark blue tents\r\ninstead of the white ones.\r\n\r\nThese looked very well, no doubt, freshly dyed as they were,\r\nbut the question was, What would they look like after a couple of\r\nmonths' use? The general opinion was that they would probably, to a\r\ngreat extent, have reverted to their original colour -- or lack of\r\ncolour. Some better patent had to be invented. As we were sitting\r\nover our coffee after dinner one day, someone suddenly suggested:\r\n\"But look here -- suppose we took our bunk -- curtains and made an\r\nouter tent of them?\" This time the smile that passed over the company,\r\nas they put down their cups, was almost compassionate. Nothing was\r\nsaid, but the silence meant something like: \"Poor chap! -- as if we\r\nhadn't all thought of that long ago!\" The proposal was adopted without\r\ndiscussion, and Wisting had another long job, in addition to all the\r\nrest. Our bunk-curtains were dark red, and made of very light material;\r\nthey were sewed together, curtain to curtain, and finally the whole\r\nwas made into an outer tent. The curtains only sufficed for one tent,\r\nbut, remembering that half a loaf is better than no bread, we had to be\r\nsatisfied with this. The red tent, which was set up a few days after,\r\nmet with unqualified approval; it would be visible some miles away\r\nin the snow. Another important advantage was that it would protect\r\nand preserve the main tent. Inside, the effect of the combination of\r\nred and blue was to give an agreeably dark shade. Another question\r\nwas how to protect the tent from a hundred loose dogs, who were no\r\nbetter behaved than others of their kind. If the tent became stiff\r\nand brittle, it might be spoilt in a very short time. And the demands\r\nwe made on our tents were considerable; we expected them to last at\r\nleast 120 days. I therefore got Wisting to make two tent-protectors,\r\nor guards. These guards consisted simply of a piece of gabardine\r\nlong enough to stretch all round the tent, and to act as a fence in\r\npreventing the dogs from coming in direct contact with the tents. The\r\nguards were made with loops, so that they could be stretched upon\r\nski-poles. They looked very fine when they were finished, but they\r\nnever came to be used; for, as soon as we began the journey, we\r\nfound a material that was even more suitable and always to be had --\r\nsnow. Idiots! -- of course, we all knew that, only we wouldn't say\r\nso. Well, that was one against us. However, the guards came in well as\r\nreserve material on the trip, and many were the uses they were put to.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, Wisting had to make wind-clothing for every\r\nman. That we had brought out proved to be too small, but the things\r\nhe made were big enough. There was easily room for two more in\r\nmy trousers; but they have to be so. In these regions one soon\r\nfinds out that everything that is roomy is warm and comfortable,\r\nwhile everything that is tight -- foot-gear, of course, excepted --\r\nis warm and uncomfortable. One quickly gets into a perspiration,\r\nand spoils the clothes. Besides the breeches and anorak of light\r\nwind-cloth, he made stockings of the same material. I assumed that\r\nthese stockings -- worn among the other stockings we had on -- would\r\nhave an insulating effect. Opinions were greatly divided on this point;\r\nbut I must confess -- in common with my four companions on the Polar\r\njourney -- that I would never make a serious trip without them. They\r\nfulfilled all our expectations. The rime was deposited on them freely,\r\nand was easily brushed off. If they got wet, it was easy to dry them\r\nin almost all weathers; I know of no material that dries so quickly\r\nas this windproof stuff. Another thing was that they protected the\r\nother stockings against tears, and made them last much longer than\r\nwould otherwise have been the case.\r\n\r\nAs evidence of how pleased we who took part in the long sledge journey\r\nwere with these stockings, I may mention that when we reached the depot\r\nin 80deg.S. -- on the homeward trip, be it noted; that is, when we looked\r\nupon the journey as over -- we found there some bags with various\r\narticles of clothing. In one of these were two pairs of windproof\r\nstockings -- the bag presumably belonged to an opponent of the idea --\r\nand it may be imagined that there was some fun. We all wanted them --\r\nall, without exception. The two lucky ones each seized his pair and\r\nhid it, as if it was the most costly treasure. What they wanted with\r\nthem I cannot guess, as we were at home; but this example shows how\r\nwe had learnt to appreciate them.\r\n\r\nI recommend them most warmly to men who are undertaking similar\r\nexpeditions. But -- I must add -- they must give themselves the trouble\r\nof taking off their foot-gear every evening, and brushing the rime off\r\ntheir stockings; if one does not do this, of course, the rime will thaw\r\nin the course of the night, and everything will be soaking wet in the\r\nmorning. In that case you must not blame the stockings, but yourself.\r\n\r\nAfter this it was the turn of the underclothing; there was nothing\r\nin the tailoring and outfitting department that Wisting could not\r\nmanage. Among our medical stores we had two large rolls of the most\r\nbeautiful fine light flannel, and of this he made underclothing for\r\nall of us. What we had brought out from home was made of extremely\r\nthick woollen material, and we were afraid this would be too\r\nwarm. Personally, I wore Wisting's make the whole trip, and have never\r\nknown anything so perfect. Then he had covers for the sleeping-bags\r\nto sew and patch, and one thing and another. Some people give one the\r\nimpression of being able to make anything, and to get it done in no\r\ntime -- others not.\r\n\r\nHanssen had his days well occupied, industrious and handy as he\r\nwas. He was an expert at anything relating to sledges, and knew\r\nexactly what had to be done. Whatever he had a hand in, I could\r\nfeel sure of; he never left anything to chance. Besides lashing\r\nthe sledges, he had a number of other things to do. Amongst them,\r\nhe was to prepare all the whips we required -- two for each driver,\r\nor fourteen altogether. Stubberud was to supply the handles. In\r\nconsultation with the \"Carpenters' Union,\" I had chosen a handle\r\nmade of three narrow strips of hickory. I assumed that if these were\r\nsecurely lashed together, and the lashings covered with leather,\r\nthey would make as strong a handle as one could expect to get. The\r\nidea of the composite handle of three pieces of wood was that it would\r\ngive and bend instead of breaking. We knew by experience that a solid\r\nwhip-handle did not last very long. It was arranged, then, that the\r\nhandles were to be made by Stubberud, and passed on to Hanssen.\r\n\r\nThe whip-lashes were made by Hassel, in the course of the winter, on\r\nthe Eskimo model. They were round and heavy -- as they should be --\r\nand dangerous to come near, when they were wielded by an experienced\r\nhand. Hanssen received these different parts to join them together and\r\nmake the whip. As usual, this was done with all possible care. Three\r\nstrong lashings were put on each handle, and these again were covered\r\nwith leather. Personally, Hanssen was not in favour of the triple\r\nhickory handle, but he did the work without raising any objection. We\r\nall remarked, it is true, that at this time, contrary to his habit,\r\nhe spent the hours after supper with Wisting. I wondered a little at\r\nthis, as I knew Hanssen was very fond of a game of whist after supper,\r\nand never missed it unless he had work to do. I happened one evening\r\nto express my surprise at this, and Stubberud answered at once:\r\n\"He's making handles.\" -- \"What sort of handles?\" -- \"Whip-handles;\r\nbut,\" Stubberud added, \"I'll guarantee those hickory handles I'm\r\nmaking. You can't have anything tougher and stronger than those.\" He\r\nwas rather sore about it, that was easy to see; the idea was his own,\r\ntoo. Then -- talk of the devil -- in walked Hanssen, with a fine big\r\nwhip in his hand. I, of course, appeared extremely surprised. \"What,\"\r\nI said, \"more whips?\" -- \"Yes,\" said he; \"I don't believe in those\r\nI'm making in the daytime. But here's a whip that I can trust.\" I\r\nmust admit that it looked well. The whole handle was covered, so that\r\none could not see what it was made of. \"But,\" I ventured to object,\r\n\"are you sure it is as strong as the others?\" -- \"Oh, as to that,\"\r\nhe answered, \"I'm quite ready to back it against any of those --\r\n\" He did not say the word, nor was there any need. His meaning was\r\nunmistakable, and \"rotten whips\" sounded in our ears as plainly as\r\nif he had shouted it. I had no time to observe the effect of this\r\nterrible utterance, for a determined voice called out: \"We'll see\r\nabout that!\" I turned round, and there was Stubberud leaning against\r\nthe end of the table, evidently hurt by Hanssen's words, which he took\r\nas a personal affront. \"If you dare risk your whip, come on.\" He had\r\ntaken down one of the insulted triple-handled whips from the shelf in\r\nhis bunk, and stood in a fighting attitude. This promised well. We\r\nall looked at Hanssen. He had gone too far to be able to draw back;\r\nhe had to fight. He took his weapon in his hand, and entered the\r\n\"ring.\" The conditions were arranged and accepted by both parties;\r\nthey were to fight until one of the handles was broken. And then the\r\nwhip duel began. The opponents were very serious over it. One, two,\r\nthree -- the first blow fell, handle against handle. The combatants\r\nhad shut their eyes and awaited the result; when they opened them\r\nagain, they shone with happy surprise -- both handles were as whole as\r\nbefore. Now each of them was really delighted with his own handle,\r\nand the blows fell faster. Stubberud, who was standing with his\r\nback to the table, got so excited over the unexpected result that,\r\nevery time he raised his weapon, he gave the edge of the table a\r\nresounding smack without knowing it. How many rounds had been fought\r\nI do not know, when I heard a crack, followed by the words: \"There\r\nyou can see, old man!\" As Stubberud left the ring, I was able to see\r\nHanssen. He stood on the battle-field, eyeing his whip; it looked like\r\na broken lily. The spectators had not been silent; they had followed\r\nthe fight with excitement, amid laughter and shouts. \"That's right,\r\nStubberud. Don't give in!\" \"Bravo, Hanssen! that's a good one!\"\r\n\r\nThe whips afterwards turned out remarkably well -- not that they lasted\r\nout the trip, but they held together for a long while. Whip-handles\r\nare a very perishable commodity; if one used nothing but the lash,\r\nthey would be everlasting, but, as a rule, one is not long satisfied\r\nwith that. It is when one gives a \"confirmation,\" as we call it, that\r\nthe handle breaks. A confirmation is generally held when some sinner\r\nor other has gone wrong and refuses to obey. It consists in taking the\r\nfirst opportunity, when the sledge stops, of going in among the dogs,\r\ntaking out the defiant one, and laying into him with the handle. These\r\nconfirmations, if they occur frequently, may use up a lot of handles.\r\n\r\nIt was also arranged that Hanssen should prepare goggles in the Eskimo\r\nfashion, and he began this work; but it soon appeared that everyone\r\nhad some patent of his own which was much better. Therefore it was\r\ngiven up, and every man made his own goggles.\r\n\r\nStubberud's chief work was making the sledge cases lighter, and\r\nhe succeeded in doing this, but not without hard work. It took far\r\nlonger than one would have thought. The wood had a good many knots,\r\nand he often had to work against the grain; the planing was therefore\r\nrather difficult and slow. He planed a good deal off them, but could\r\n\"guarantee them,\" as he said. Their sides were not many millimetres\r\nthick; to strengthen them in the joints, corners of aluminium were\r\nput on.\r\n\r\nIn addition to remaking the sledges, Bjaaland had to get the ski\r\nready. To fit the big, broad boots we should wear, the Huitfeldt\r\nfittings had to be much broader than usual, and we had such with us,\r\nso that Bjaaland had only to change them. The ski-bindings were like\r\nthe snow-goggles; everyone had his own patent. I found the bindings\r\nthat Bjaaland had put on for himself so efficient that I had no\r\nhesitation in ordering similar ones for myself; and it may be said\r\nto their honour, and to the honour of him who made them, that they\r\nwere first-rate, and served me well during the whole trip. They were,\r\nafter all, only a retention of the old system, but, with the help of\r\nhooks and eyes, they could be put on and taken off in an instant. And\r\nthose were the conditions we demanded of our bindings -- that they\r\nshould hold the foot as firmly as a vice, and should be easy to hook\r\non and take off. For we always had to take them off on the journey;\r\nif one left one's bindings out for a night, they were gone in the\r\nmorning. The dogs looked upon them as a delicacy. The toe-strap also\r\nhad to be removed in the evening; in other words, the ski had to be\r\nleft absolutely bare.\r\n\r\nJohansen, besides his packing, was occupied in making weights and\r\ntent-pegs. The weights were very ingeniously made; the steelyard\r\nsystem was adopted. If they were never used, it was not the fault of\r\nthe weights -- they were good enough. But the reason was that we had\r\nall our provisions so arranged that they could be taken without being\r\nweighed. We were all weighed on August 6, and it then appeared that\r\nLindstrom was the heaviest, with 13 st. 8 lbs. On that occasion he was\r\nofficially christened \"Fatty.\" The tent-pegs Johansen made were the\r\nopposite of what such pegs usually are; in other words, they were flat\r\ninstead of being high. We saw the advantage at once. Besides being\r\nso much lighter, they were many times stronger. I do not know that\r\nwe ever broke a peg on the trip; possibly we lost one or two. Most\r\nof them were brought home undamaged.\r\n\r\nHassel worked at his whip-lashes down in the petroleum store. It was\r\nan uncomfortable place for him -- always cold; but he had the lashes\r\nready by the time he had promised them.\r\n\r\nPrestrud made charts and copied out tables. Six of us were to have\r\nthese copies. In each sledge there was a combined provision and\r\nobservation book, bearing the same number as the sledge. It contained,\r\nfirst, an exact list of the provisions contained in each case on that\r\nsledge, and, in addition, the necessary tables for our astronomical\r\nobservations. In these books each man kept a daily account of every\r\nscrap of provisions he took out; in this way we could always check\r\nthe contents of the cases, and know what quantity of provisions we\r\nhad. Farther on in the book the observations were entered, and the\r\ndistance covered for the day, course, and so on.\r\n\r\nThat is a rough outline of what we were doing in the course of the\r\nwinter in \"working hours.\" Besides this there were, of course,\r\na hundred things that every man had to do for his personal\r\nequipment. During the winter each man had his outfit served out\r\nto him, so that he might have time to make whatever alterations he\r\nfound necessary. Every man received a heavy and a lighter suit of\r\nreindeer-skin, as well as reindeer-skin mits and stockings. He also\r\nhad dogskin stockings and sealskin kamiks. In addition, there was a\r\ncomplete outfit of underclothing and wind-clothes. All were served\r\nalike; there was no priority at all. The skin clothing was the first\r\nto be tackled, and here there was a good deal to be done, as nothing\r\nhad been made to measure. One man found that the hood of his anorak\r\ncame too far down over his eyes, another that it did not come down far\r\nenough; so both had to set to work at alterations, one cutting off,\r\nthe other adding a piece. One found his trousers too long, another\r\ntoo short, and they had to alter those. However, they managed it;\r\nthe needle was always at work, either for sewing a piece on, or for\r\nhemming the shortened piece. Although we began this work in good time,\r\nit looked as if we should never have finished. The room orderly had\r\nto sweep out huge piles of strips and reindeer-hair every morning,\r\nbut the next morning there were just as many. If we had stayed there,\r\nI am sure we should still be sitting and sewing away at our outfit.\r\n\r\nA number of patents were invented. Of course, the everlasting mask for\r\nthe face was to the fore, and took the form of nose-protectors. I,\r\ntoo, allowed myself to be beguiled into experimenting, with good\r\nreason, as I thought, but with extremely poor results. I had hit upon\r\nsomething which, of course, I thought much better than anything that\r\nhad been previously tried. The day I put on my invention, I not only\r\ngot my nose frozen, but my forehead and cheek as well. I never tried\r\nit again. Hassel was great at new inventions; he wore nose-protectors\r\nall over him. These patents are very good things for passing the time;\r\nwhen one actually takes the field, they all vanish. They are useless\r\nfor serious work.\r\n\r\nThe sleeping-bags were also a great source of interest. Johansen\r\nwas at work on the double one he was so keen on. Heaven knows how\r\nmany skins he put into it! I don't, nor did I ever try to find\r\nout. Bjaaland was also in full swing with alterations to his. He\r\nfound the opening at the top inconvenient, and preferred to have it\r\nin the middle; his arrangement of a flap, with buttons and loops,\r\nmade it easy to mistake him for a colonel of dragoons when he was\r\nin bed. He was tremendously pleased with it; but so he was with his\r\nsnow-goggles, in spite of the fact that he could not see with them,\r\nand that they allowed him to become snow-blind. The rest of us kept\r\nour sleeping-bags as they were, only lengthening or shortening them\r\nas required. We were all greatly pleased with the device for closing\r\nthem -- on the plan of a sack. Outside our bags we had a cover of\r\nvery thin canvas; this was extremely useful, and I would not be\r\nwithout it for anything. In the daytime the sleeping-bag was always\r\nwell protected by this cover; no snow could get in. At night it was\r\nperhaps even more useful, as it protected the bag from the moisture\r\nof the breath. Instead of condensing on the skin and making it wet,\r\nthis settled on the cover, forming in the course of the night a film\r\nof ice, which disappeared again during the day, breaking off while the\r\nbag ay stretched on the sledge. This cover ought to be of ample size;\r\nit is important that it should be rather longer than the sleeping-bag,\r\nso that one may have plenty of it round the neck, and thus prevent\r\nthe breath from penetrating into the bag. We all had double bags --\r\nan inner and an outer one. The inner one was of calf-skin or thin\r\nfemale reindeer-skin, and quite light; the outer one was of heavy\r\nbuck reindeer-skin, and weighed about 13 pounds. Both were open at\r\nthe end, like a sack, and were laced together round the neck. I have\r\nalways found this pattern the easiest, simplest, most comfortable,\r\nand best. We recommend it to all.\r\n\r\nNovelties in the way of snow-goggles were many. This was, of course, a\r\nmatter of the greatest importance and required study -- it was studied,\r\ntoo! The particular problem was to find good goggles without glass. It\r\nis true that I had worn nothing but a pair of ordinary spectacles,\r\nwith light yellow glasses, all the autumn, and that they had proved\r\nexcellent; but for the long journey I was afraid these would give\r\ninsufficient protection. I therefore threw myself into the competition\r\nfor the best patent. The end of it was that we all went in for leather\r\ngoggles, with a little slit for the eyes. The Bjaaland patent won the\r\nprize, and was most adopted. Hassel had his own invention, combined\r\nwith a nose-protector; when spread out it reminded me of the American\r\neagle. I never saw him use it. Nor did any of us use these new goggles,\r\nexcept Bjaaland. He used his own goggles the whole way, but then,\r\nhe was the only one who became snow-blind. The spectacles I wore --\r\nHanssen had the same; they were the only two pairs we had -- gave\r\nperfect protection; not once did I have a sign of snow-blindness. They\r\nwere exactly like other spectacles, without any gauze at all round the\r\nglasses; the light could penetrate everywhere. Dr. Schanz, of Dresden,\r\nwho sent me these glasses, has every right to be satisfied with his\r\ninvention; its beats anything I have ever tried or seen.\r\n\r\nThe next great question was our boots. I had expressly pointed out\r\nthat boots must be taken, whether the person concerned intended to\r\nwear them or not; for boots were indispensable, in case of having\r\nto cross any glacier, which was a contingency we had to reckon with,\r\nfrom the descriptions we had read of the country. With this proviso\r\neveryone might do as he pleased, and all began by improving their\r\nboots in accordance with our previous experience. The improvement\r\nconsisted in making them larger. Wisting took mine in hand again,\r\nand began once more to pull them to pieces. It is only by tearing a\r\nthing to pieces that one can see what the work is like. We gained a\r\ngood insight into the way our boots had been made; stronger or more\r\nconscientious work it would be impossible to find. It was hard work\r\npulling them to pieces. This time mine lost a couple more soles. How\r\nmany that made altogether I do not remember, but now I got what I had\r\nalways called for -- room enough. Besides being able to wear all the\r\nfoot-coverings I had, I could also find room for a wooden sole. That\r\nmade me happy; my great object was achieved. Now the temperature could\r\nbe as low as it liked; it would not get through the wooden soles and\r\nmy various stockings -- seven pairs, I think, in all. I was pleased\r\nthat evening, as the struggle had been a long one; it had taken me\r\nnearly two years to arrive at this result.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was the dog-harness, which we must all have in\r\norder. The experience of the last depot journey, when two dogs fell\r\ninto a crevasse through faulty harness, must not be allowed to repeat\r\nitself, We therefore devoted great care and attention to this gear,\r\nand used all the best materials we had. The result rewarded our pains;\r\nwe had good, strong harness for every team.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis description will, perhaps, open the eyes of some people, and show\r\nthem that the equipment of an expedition such as we were about to enter\r\nupon is not the affair of a day. It is not money alone that makes for\r\nthe success of such an expedition -- though, Heaven knows, it is a good\r\nthing to have -- but it is in a great measure -- indeed, I may say\r\nthat this is the greatest factor -- the way in which the expedition\r\nis equipped -- the way in which every difficulty is foreseen, and\r\nprecautions taken for meeting or avoiding it. Victory awaits him who\r\nhas everything in order -- luck, people call it. Defeat is certain for\r\nhim who has neglected to take the necessary precautions in time; this\r\nis called bad luck. But pray do not think this is an epitaph I wish\r\nto have inscribed on my own tomb. No; honour where honour is due --\r\nhonour to my faithful comrades, who, by their patience, perseverance\r\nand experience, brought our equipment to the limit of perfection,\r\nand thereby rendered our victory possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn August 16 we began to pack our sledges; two were placed in the\r\nCrystal Palace and two in the Clothing Store. It was a great advantage\r\nto be able to do this work under cover; at this time the temperature\r\nwas dancing a cancan between -58deg. and -75deg.F., with an occasional\r\nrefreshing breeze of thirteen or fourteen miles an hour. It would have\r\nbeen almost an impossibility to pack the sledges out of doors under\r\nthese conditions if it was to be done carefully and firmly; and,\r\nof course, it had to be so done. Our fixed wire-rope lashings had\r\nto be laced together with lengths of thin rope, and this took time;\r\nbut when properly done, as it was now, the cases were held as though\r\nin a vice, and could not move. The zinc plates we had had under the\r\nsledges to keep them up in loose snow had been taken off; we could not\r\nsee that we should have any use for them. In their place we had lashed\r\na spare ski under each sledge, and these were very useful later. By\r\nAugust 22 all the sledges were ready, waiting to be driven away.\r\n\r\nThe dogs did not like the cold weather we had now had for so long;\r\nwhen the temperature went down between -58deg. and -75deg. F., one could\r\nsee by their movements that they felt it. They stood still and raised\r\ntheir feet from the ground in turn, holding each foot up for a while\r\nbefore putting it down again on the cold surface. They were cunning and\r\nresourceful in the extreme. They did not care very much for fish, and\r\nsome of them were difficult to get into the tents on the evenings when\r\nthey knew there was fish. Stubberud, especially, had a great deal of\r\ntrouble with one of the young dogs -- Funcho was his name. He was born\r\nat Madeira during our stay there in September, 1910. On meat evenings\r\neach man, after fastening up his dogs, went, as has been described,\r\nup to the wall of the meat-tent and took his box of chopped-up meat,\r\nwhich was put out there. Funcho used to watch for this moment. When he\r\nsaw Stubberud take the box, he knew there was meat, and then he came\r\nquietly into the tent, as though there was nothing the matter. If, on\r\nthe other hand, Stubberud showed no sign of fetching the box, the dog\r\nwould not come, nor was it possible to get hold of him. This happened\r\na few times, but then Stubberud hit upon a stratagem. When Funcho,\r\nas usual -- even on a fish evening -- watched the scene of chaining up\r\nthe other dogs from a distance, Stubberud went calmly up to the wall,\r\ntook the empty box that lay there, put it on his shoulder, and returned\r\nto the tent. Funcho was taken in. He hurried joyfully into the tent,\r\ndelighted, no doubt, with Stubberud's generosity in providing meat two\r\nevenings running. But there, to his great surprise, a very different\r\nreception awaited him from that he expected. He was seized by the neck\r\nand made fast for the night. After an ugly scowl at the empty box,\r\nhe looked at Stubberud; what he thought, I am not sure. Certain it\r\nis that the ruse was not often successful after that. Funcho got a\r\ndried fish for supper, and had to be content with it.\r\n\r\nWe did not lose many dogs in the course of the winter. Two -- Jeppe\r\nand Jakob -- died of some disease or other. Knaegten was shot, as he\r\nlost almost all his hair over half his body. Madeiro, born at Madeira,\r\ndisappeared early in the autumn; Tom disappeared later -- both these\r\nundoubtedly fell into crevasses. We had a very good opportunity --\r\ntwice -- of seeing how this might happen; both times we saw the dog\r\ndisappear into the crevasse, and could watch him from the surface. He\r\nwent quite quietly backwards and forwards down below without uttering\r\na sound. These crevasses were not deep, but they were steep-sided,\r\nso that the dog could not get out without help. The two dogs I have\r\nmentioned undoubtedly met their death in this way: a slow death\r\nit must be, when one remembers how tenacious of life a dog is. It\r\nhappened several times that dogs disappeared, were absent for some\r\ndays, and then came back; possibly they had been down a crevasse, and\r\nhad finally succeeded in getting out of it again. Curiously enough,\r\nthey did not pay much attention to the weather when they went on trips\r\nof this kind. When the humour took them, they would disappear, even\r\nif the temperature was down in the fifties below zero, with wind and\r\ndriving snow. Thus Jaala, a lady belonging to Bjaaland, took it into\r\nher head to go off with three attendant cavaliers. We came upon them\r\nlater; they were then lying quietly behind a hummock down on the ice,\r\nand seemed to be quite happy. They had been away for about eight days\r\nwithout food, and during that time the temperature had seldom been\r\nabove -58deg. F.\r\n\r\nAugust 23 arrived: calm, partly overcast, and -43.6deg.F. Finer weather\r\nfor taking out our sledges and driving them over to the starting-point\r\ncould not be imagined. They had to be brought up through the door\r\nof the Clothing Store; it was the largest and the easiest to get\r\nthrough. We had first to dig away the snow, which latterly had been\r\nallowed to collect there, as the inmates of this department had\r\nfor some time past used the inner passage. The snow had blotted out\r\neverything, so that no sign of the entrance could be seen; but with\r\na couple of strong shovels, and a couple of strong men to use them,\r\nthe opening was soon laid bare. To get the sledges up was a longer\r\nbusiness; they weighed 880 pounds apiece, and the way up to the surface\r\nwas steep. A tackle was rigged, and by hauling and shoving they slowly,\r\none by one, came up into daylight. We dragged them away to a place\r\nnear the instrument-screen, so as to get a clear start away from the\r\nhouse. The dogs were fresh and wild, and wanted plenty of room; a case,\r\nnot to mention a post, still less the instrument-screen, would all\r\nhave been objects of extreme interest, to which, if there had been\r\nthe slightest opportunity, their course would infallibly have been\r\ndirected. The protests of their drivers would have been of little\r\navail. The dogs had not been let loose that morning, and every man\r\nwas now in his tent harnessing them. Meanwhile I stood contemplating\r\nthe packed sledges that stood there ready to begin the long journey.\r\n\r\nI tried to work up a little poetry -- \"the ever-restless spirit of\r\nman \" -- \"the mysterious, awe-inspiring wilderness of ice\" -- but it\r\nwas no good; I suppose it was too early in the morning. I abandoned\r\nmy efforts, after coming to the conclusion that each sledge gave one\r\nmore the idea of a coffin than of anything else, all the cases being\r\npainted black.\r\n\r\nIt was as we had expected: the dogs were on the verge of\r\nexploding. What a time we had getting them all into the traces! They\r\ncould not stand still an instant; either it was a friend they wanted\r\nto wish good-morning, or it was an enemy they were longing to fly\r\nat. There was always something going on; when they kicked out with\r\ntheir hind-legs, raising a cloud of snow, or glared defiantly at each\r\nother, it often caused their driver an anxious moment. If he had his\r\neye on them at this stage, he might, by intervening quickly and firmly,\r\nprevent the impending battle; but one cannot be everywhere at once,\r\nand the result was a series of the wildest fights. Strange beasts! They\r\nhad been going about the place comparatively peacefully the whole\r\nwinter, and now, as soon as they were in harness, they must needs\r\nfight as if their lives depended on it. At last we were all ready\r\nand away. It was the first time we had driven with teams of twelve,\r\nso that we were anxious to see the result.\r\n\r\nIt went better than we had expected; of course, not like an express\r\ntrain, but we could not expect that the first time. Some of the dogs\r\nhad grown too fat in the course of the winter, and had difficulty in\r\nkeeping up; for them this first trip was a stiff pull. But most of them\r\nwere in excellent condition -- fine, rounded bodies, not lumpish. It\r\ndid not take long to get up the hill this time; most of them had to\r\nstop and get their wind on the slope, but there were some that did\r\nit without a halt. Up at the top everything looked just as we had\r\nleft it in April. The flag was still standing where we had planted\r\nit, and did not look much the worse for wear. And, what was still\r\nstranger, we could see our old tracks southward. We drove all our\r\nsledges well up, unharnessed the dogs, and let them go. We took it\r\nfor granted that they would all rush joyfully home to the flesh-pots,\r\nnor did the greater number disappoint us. They set off gaily homewards,\r\nand soon the ice was strewn with dogs. They did not behave altogether\r\nlike good children. In some places there was a sort of mist over the\r\nice; this was the cloud of snow thrown up by the combatants. But on\r\ntheir return they were irreproachable; one could not take any notice\r\nof a halt here and there. At the inspection that evening, it appeared\r\nthat ten of them were missing. That was strange -- could all ten have\r\ngone down crevasses? It seemed unlikely.\r\n\r\nNext morning two men went over to the starting-point to look for\r\nthe missing dogs. On the way they crossed a couple of crevasses, but\r\nthere was no dog to be seen. When they arrived at the place where the\r\nsledges stood, there lay all ten curled up asleep. They were lying\r\nby their own sledges, and did not seem to take the slightest notice\r\nof the men's arrival. One or two of them may have opened an eye,\r\nbut that was all. When they were roused and given to understand by\r\nunmistakable signs that their presence was desired at home, they seemed\r\nastonished beyond all bounds. Some of them simply declined to believe\r\nit; they merely turned round a few times and lay down again on the\r\nsame spot. They had to be flogged home. Can anything more inexplicable\r\nbe imagined? There they lay, three miles from their comfortable home,\r\nwhere they knew that abundance of food awaited them -- in a temperature\r\nof -40deg.F. Although they had now been out for twenty-four hours, none of\r\nthem gave a sign of wanting to leave the spot. If it had been summer,\r\nwith warm sunshine, one might have understood it; but as it was -- no!\r\n\r\nThat day -- August 24 -- the sun appeared above the Barrier again for\r\nthe first time in four months. He looked very smiling, with a friendly\r\nnod for the old pressure-ridges he had seen for so many years; but\r\nwhen his first beams reached the starting-point, his face might well\r\nshow surprise. \"Well, if they're not first, after all! And I've been\r\ndoing all I could to get here!\" It could not be denied; we had won\r\nthe race, and reached the Barrier a day before him.\r\n\r\nThe day for our actual start could not be fixed; we should have to\r\nwait until the temperature moderated somewhat. So long as it continued\r\nto grovel in the depths, we could not think of setting out. All our\r\nthings were now ready up on the Barrier, and nothing remained but\r\nto harness the dogs and start. When I say all our things were ready,\r\nthis is not the impression anyone would have gained who looked in on\r\nus; the cutting out and sewing were going on worse than ever. What\r\nhad previously occurred to one as a thing of secondary importance,\r\nwhich might be done if there was time, but might otherwise quite well\r\nbe dropped, now suddenly appeared as the most important part of the\r\nwhole outfit; and then out came the knife and cut away, until great\r\nheaps of offcuts and hair lay about the floor; then the needle was\r\nproduced, and seam after seam added to those there were already.\r\n\r\nThe days went by, and the temperature would give no sign of spring;\r\nnow and then it would make a jump of about thirty degrees, but only\r\nto sink just as rapidly back to -58deg. F. It is not at all pleasant to\r\nhang about waiting like this; I always have the idea that I am the only\r\none who is left behind, while all the others are out on the road. And\r\nI could guess that I was not the only one of us who felt this.\r\n\r\n\"I'd give something to know how far Scott is to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he's not out yet, bless you! It's much too cold for his ponies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but how do you know they have it as cold as this? I expect it's\r\nfar warmer where they are, among the mountains; and you can take your\r\noath they're not lying idle. Those boys have shown what they can do.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the sort of conversation one could hear daily. The uncertainty\r\nwas worrying many of us -- not all -- and, personally, I felt it a\r\ngreat deal. I was determined to get away as soon as it was at all\r\npossible, and the objection that much might be lost by starting too\r\nearly did not seem to me to have much force. If we saw that it was\r\ntoo cold, all we had to do was to turn back; so that I could not see\r\nthere was any risk.\r\n\r\nSeptember came, with -43.6deg. F. That is a temperature that one can\r\nalways stand, but we had better wait and see what it is going to do;\r\nperhaps it will only play its old tricks again. Next day, -63.4deg.\r\nF.; calm and clear. September 6, -20.2deg. F. At last the change had\r\ncome, and we thought it was high time. Next day, -7.6deg. F. The little\r\nslant of wind that came from the east felt quite like a mild spring\r\nbreeze. Well, at any rate, we now had a good temperature to start\r\nin. Every man ready; to-morrow we are off.\r\n\r\nSeptember 8 arrived. We turned out as usual, had breakfast, and were\r\nthen on the move. We had not much to do. The empty sledges we were to\r\nuse for driving up to the starting-point were ready; we only had to\r\nthrow a few things on to them. But it turned out that the mere fact\r\nof having so few things was the cause of its taking a long time. We\r\nwere to harness twelve dogs to the empty sledges, and we had an idea\r\nthat it would cost us a struggle to get away. We helped each other,\r\ntwo and two, to bring the dogs to the sledges and harness them. Those\r\nwho were really careful had anchored their sledges to a peg firmly\r\nfixed in the snow; others had contented themselves with capsizing\r\ntheir sledges; and others, again, were even more reckless. We all\r\nhad to be ready before the first man could start; otherwise, it would\r\nhave been impossible for those who were behind to hold in their dogs,\r\nand the result would have been a false start.\r\n\r\nOur dogs were in a fearful state of excitement and confusion that\r\nmorning, but at last everything was ready, barring one or two\r\ntrifles. Then I suddenly heard a wild yell, and, spinning round,\r\nI saw a team tearing off without a driver. The next driver rushed\r\nforward to help, with the result that his dogs made off after the\r\nothers. The two sledges were on ahead, and the two drivers after them\r\nin full gallop; but the odds were too unequal -- in a few moments\r\nthe drivers were beaten. The two runaway teams had made off in a\r\nsouth-westerly direction, and were going like the wind. The men had\r\nhard work; they had long ago stopped running, and were now following\r\nin the tracks of the sledges. The dogs had disappeared behind the\r\nridges, which the men did not reach till much later.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the rest of us waited. The question was, what would those\r\ntwo do when at last they had come up with their sledges? Would they\r\nturn and go home, or would they drive up to the starting-point? Waiting\r\nwas no fun under any circumstances, and so we decided to go on to the\r\nstarting-point, and, if necessary, wait there. No sooner said than\r\ndone, and away we went. Now we should see what command the fellows had\r\nover their dogs, for, in all canine probability, these teams would now\r\ntry to follow the same course that the runaways had taken. This fear\r\nturned out not to be groundless; three managed to turn their dogs and\r\nput them in the right direction, but the other two were off on the\r\nnew course. Afterwards, of course, they tried to make out that they\r\nthought we were all going that way. I smiled, but said nothing. It\r\nhad happened more than once that my own dogs had taken charge; no\r\ndoubt I had felt rather foolish at the time, but after all ....\r\n\r\nIt was not till noon that we all assembled with our sledges. The\r\ndrivers of the runaways had had stiff work to catch them, and were\r\nwet through with their exertions. I had some thoughts of turning\r\nback, as three young puppies had followed us; if we went on, we\r\nshould have to shoot them. But to turn back after all this work,\r\nand then probably have the same thing over again next morning, was\r\nnot a pleasant prospect. And, above all, to see Lindstrom standing\r\nat the door, shaking with laughter -- no, we had better go on. I\r\nthink we were all agreed in this. The dogs were now harnessed to the\r\nloaded sledges, and the empty ones were stacked one above another. At\r\n1.30 p.m. we were off. The old tracks were soon lost sight of, but we\r\nimmediately picked up the line of flags that had been set up at every\r\nsecond kilometre on the last depot journey. The going was splendid,\r\nand we went at a rattling pace to the south. We did not go very far\r\nthe first day -- eleven and three-quarter miles -- and pitched our\r\ncamp at 3.30 p.m. The first night out is never very pleasant, but this\r\ntime it was awful. There was such a row going on among our ninety dogs\r\nthat we could not close our eyes. It was a blessed relief when four in\r\nthe morning came round, and we could begin to get up. We had to shoot\r\nthe three puppies when we stopped for lunch that day. The going was\r\nthe same; nothing could be better. The flags we were following stood\r\njust as we had left them; they showed no trace of there having been any\r\nsnowfall in the interval. That day we did fifteen and a half miles. The\r\ndogs were not yet in training, but were picking up every hour.\r\n\r\nBy the 10th they seemed to have reached their full vigour; that day\r\nnone of us could hold in his team. They all wanted to get forward, with\r\nthe result that one team ran into another, and confusion followed. This\r\nwas a tiresome business; the dogs wore themselves out to no purpose,\r\nand, of course, the time spent in extricating them from one another\r\nwas lost. They were perfectly wild that day. When Lassesen, for\r\ninstance, caught sight of his enemy Hans, who was in another team,\r\nhe immediately encouraged his friend Fix to help him. These two then\r\nput on all the speed they could, with the result that the others in\r\nthe same team were excited by the sudden acceleration, and joined\r\nin the spurt. It made no difference how the driver tried to stop\r\nthem; they went on just as furiously, until they reached the team\r\nthat included the object of Lassesen's and Fix's endeavours. Then\r\nthe two teams dashed into each other, and we had ninety-six dogs'\r\nlegs to sort out. The only thing that could be done was to let those\r\nwho could not hold in their teams unharness some of the dogs and tie\r\nthem on the sledge. In this way we got things to work satisfactorily\r\nat last. We covered eighteen and a half miles that day.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 11th, we woke up to a temperature of -67.9deg. F. The\r\nweather was splendid, calm, and clear. We could see by the dogs\r\nthat they were not feeling happy, as they had kept comparatively\r\nquiet that night. The cold affected the going at once; it was slow\r\nand unyielding. We came across some crevasses, and Hanssen's sledge\r\nwas nearly in one; but it was held up, and he came out of it without\r\nserious consequences. The cold caused no discomfort on the march;\r\non the contrary, at times it was too warm. One's breath was like a\r\ncloud, and so thick was the vapour over the dogs that one could not\r\nsee one team from the next, though the sledges were being driven\r\nclose to one another.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th it was -61.6deg. F., with a breeze dead against us. This\r\nwas undeniably bitter. It was easy to see that the temperature\r\nwas too much for the dogs; in the morning, especially, they were\r\na pitiful sight. They lay rolled up as tightly as possible, with\r\ntheir noses under their tails, and from time to time one could see a\r\nshiver run through their bodies; indeed, some of them were constantly\r\nshivering. We had to lift them up and put them into their harness. I\r\nhad to admit that with this temperature it would not pay to go on;\r\nthe risk was too great. We therefore decided to drive on to the\r\ndepot in 80deg. S., and unload our sledges there. On that day, too,\r\nwe made the awkward discovery that the fluid in our compasses had\r\nfrozen, rendering them useless. The weather had become very thick,\r\nand we could only guess vaguely the position of the sun. Our progress\r\nunder these circumstances was very doubtful; possibly we were on\r\nthe right course, but it was just as probable -- nay, more so --\r\nthat we were off it. The best thing we could do, therefore, was to\r\npitch our camp, and wait for a better state of things. We did not\r\nbless the instrument-maker who had supplied those compasses.\r\n\r\nIt was 10 a.m. when we stopped. In order to have a good shelter for the\r\nlong day before us, we decided to build two snow-huts. The snow was\r\nnot good for this purpose, but, by fetching blocks from all sides,\r\nwe managed to put up the huts. Hanssen built one and Wisting the\r\nother. In a temperature such as we now had, a snow-hut is greatly\r\npreferable to a tent, and we felt quite comfortable when we came in\r\nand got the Primus going. That night we heard a strange noise round\r\nus. I looked under my bag to see whether we had far to drop, but\r\nthere was no sign of a disturbance anywhere. In the other but they\r\nhad heard nothing. We afterwards discovered that the sound was only\r\ndue to snow \"settling.\" By this expression I mean the movement that\r\ntakes place when a large extent of the snow surface breaks and sinks\r\n(settles down). This movement gives one the idea that the ground is\r\nsinking under one, and it is not a pleasant feeling. It is followed\r\nby a dull roar, which often makes the dogs jump into the air -- and\r\ntheir drivers, too, for that matter. Once we heard this booming on\r\nthe plateau so loud that it seemed like the thunder of cannon. We\r\nsoon grew accustomed to it.\r\n\r\nNext day the temperature was -62.5deg. F., calm, and perfectly clear. We\r\ndid eighteen and a half miles, and kept our course as well as we could\r\nwith the help of the sun. It was -69.3deg. F. when we camped. This time\r\nI had done a thing that I have always been opposed to: I had brought\r\nspirits with me in the form of a bottle of Norwegian aquavit and a\r\nbottle of gin. I thought this a suitable occasion to bring in the\r\ngin. It was as hard as flint right through. While we were thawing it\r\nthe bottle burst, and we threw it out into the snow, with the result\r\nthat all the dogs started to sneeze. The next bottle -- \"Aquavit,\r\nNo. 1\" -- was like a bone, but we had learnt wisdom by experience,\r\nand we succeeded with care in thawing it out. We waited till we were\r\nall in our bags, and then we had one. I was greatly disappointed;\r\nit was not half so good as I had thought. But I am glad I tried it,\r\nas I shall never do so again. The effect was nil; I felt nothing,\r\neither in my head or my feet.\r\n\r\nThe 14th was cool -- the temperature remained at -68.8deg. F. Fortunately\r\nit was clear, so that we could see where we were going. We had not gone\r\nfar before a bright projection appeared on the level surface. Out with\r\nthe glasses -- the depot! There it lay, right in our course. Hanssen,\r\nwho had driven first the whole way, without a forerunner, and for\r\nthe most part without a compass, had no need to be ashamed of his\r\nperformance. We agreed that it was well done, and that, no doubt,\r\nwas all the thanks he got. We reached it at 10.15 a.m., and unloaded\r\nour sledges at once. Wisting undertook the far from pleasant task of\r\ngetting us a cup of warm milk at -68.8deg. F. He put the Primus behind\r\none of the cases of provisions, and set it going; strangely enough,\r\nthe paraffin was still liquid in the vessel, but this was no doubt\r\nbecause it had been well protected in the case. A cup of Horlick's\r\nMalted Milk tasted better that day than the last time I had tried it --\r\nin a restaurant in Chicago.\r\n\r\nHaving enjoyed that, we threw ourselves on the almost empty sledges,\r\nand set our course for home. The going was difficult, but, with the\r\nlight weight they now had to pull, the dogs went along well. I sat\r\nwith Wisting, as I considered his team the strongest. The cold held\r\non unchanged, and I was often surprised that it was possible to sit\r\nstill on the sledges, as we did, without freezing; but we got on quite\r\nwell. One or two I saw off their sledges all day, and most of us jumped\r\noff from time to time and ran by the side to get warm. I myself took to\r\nmy ski and let myself be pulled along. This so-called sport has never\r\nappealed to me, but under the circumstances it was permissible; it\r\nwarmed my feet, and that was the object of it. I again had recourse to\r\nthis \"sport\" of ski-driving later on, but that was for another reason.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th, as we sat in the tent cooking and chatting, Hanssen\r\nsuddenly said: \"Why, I believe my heel's gone!\" Off came his stockings,\r\nand there was a big, dead heel, like a lump of tallow. It did not look\r\nwell. He rubbed it until he thought he \"could feel something again,\"\r\nand then put his feet back in his stockings and got into his bag. Now\r\nit was Stubberud's turn. \"Blest if I don't think there's something\r\nwrong with mine, too.\" Same proceeding -- same result. This was\r\npleasant -- two doubtful heels, and forty-six miles from Framheim! When\r\nwe started next morning it was fortunately milder -- \"almost summer\":\r\n-40deg. F. It felt quite pleasant. The difference between -40deg. and -60deg.\r\nis, in my opinion, very perceptible. It may perhaps be thought that\r\nwhen one gets so far down, a few degrees one way or the other do not\r\nmake any difference, but they do.\r\n\r\nWhile driving that day we were obliged to let loose several of the\r\ndogs, who could not keep up; we supposed that they would follow our\r\ntracks. Adam and Lazarus were never seen again. Sara fell dead on\r\nthe way without any previous symptom. Camilla was also among those\r\nlet loose.\r\n\r\nOn the way home we kept the same order as on the previous days. Hanssen\r\nand Wisting, as a rule, were a long way ahead, unless they stopped and\r\nwaited. We went at a tearing pace. We had thought of halting at the\r\nsixteen-mile flag, as we called it -- the mark at thirty kilometres\r\nfrom Framheim -- and waiting for the others to come up, but as the\r\nweather was of the best, calm and clear, and with our tracks on the\r\nway south perfectly plain, I decided to go on. The sooner we got the\r\nbad heels into the house, the better. The two first sledges arrived\r\nat 4 p.m.; the next at 6, and the two following ones at 6.30. The\r\nlast did not come in till 12.30 a.m. Heaven knows what they had been\r\ndoing on the way!\r\n\r\nWith the low temperatures we experienced on this trip, we noticed a\r\ncurious snow-formation that I had never seen before. Fine -- extremely\r\nfine -- drift-snow collected, and formed small cylindrical bodies\r\nof an average diameter of 1 1/4 inches, and about the same height;\r\nthey were, however, of various sizes. They generally rolled over the\r\nsurface like a wheel, and now and then collected into large heaps,\r\nfrom which again, one by one, or several together, they continued\r\ntheir rolling. If you took one of these bodies in the hand, there\r\nwas no increase of weight to be felt -- not the very slightest. If\r\nyou took one of the largest and crushed it, there was, so to speak,\r\nnothing left. With the temperature in the -40's, we did not see them.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we came home, we attended to the heels. Prestrud had both\r\nhis heels frozen, one slightly, the other more severely, though, so\r\nfar as I could determine, not so badly as the other two. The first\r\nthing we did was to lance the big blisters that had formed and let out\r\nthe fluid they contained; afterwards we put on boracic compresses,\r\nnight and morning. We kept up this treatment for a long time; at\r\nlast the old skin could be removed, and the new lay there fresh and\r\nhealthy. The heel was cured.\r\n\r\nCircumstances had arisen which made me consider it necessary to\r\ndivide the party into two. One party was to carry out the march to\r\nthe south; the other was to try to reach King Edward VII. Land, and\r\nsee what was to be done there, besides exploring the region around\r\nthe Bay of Whales. This party was composed of Prestrud, Stubberud,\r\nand Johansen, under the leadership of the first-named.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of this new arrangement were many. In the first place,\r\na smaller party could advance more rapidly than a larger one. Our\r\nnumbers, both of men and dogs, on several of the previous trips had\r\nclearly shown the arrangement to be unfortunate. The time we took to\r\nget ready in the morning -- four hours -- was one of the consequences\r\nof being a large party. With half the number, or only one tent full,\r\nI hoped to be able to reduce this time by half. The importance of the\r\ndepots we had laid down was, of course, greatly increased, since they\r\nwould now only have to support five members of the party originally\r\ncontemplated, and would thus be able to furnish them with supplies\r\nfor so much more time. From a purely scientific point of view, the\r\nchange offered such obvious advantages that it is unnecessary to\r\ninsist upon them. Henceforward, therefore, we worked, so to speak,\r\nin two parties. The Polar party was to leave as soon as spring came\r\nin earnest. I left it to Prestrud himself to fix the departure of\r\nthe party he was to lead; there was no such hurry for them -- they\r\ncould take things more easily.\r\n\r\nThen the same old fuss about the outfit began all over again, and the\r\nneedles were busy the whole time. Two days after our return, Wisting\r\nand Bjaaland went out to the thirty-kilometre mark with the object\r\nof bringing in the dogs that had been let loose on that part of the\r\nroute and had not yet returned. They made the trip of sixty kilometres\r\n(thirty-seven and a half miles) in six hours, and brought all the\r\nstragglers -- ten of them -- back with them. The farthest of them\r\nwere found lying by the flag; none of them showed a sign of getting\r\nup when the sledges came. They had to be picked up and harnessed,\r\nand one or two that had sore feet were driven on the sledges. In all\r\nprobability most of them would have returned in a few days. But it\r\nis incomprehensible that healthy, plucky dogs, as many of them were,\r\nshould take it into their heads to stay behind like that.\r\n\r\nOn September 24 we had the first tidings of spring, when Bjaaland\r\ncame back from the ice and told us he had shot a seal. So the seals\r\nhad begun to come up on to the ice; this was a good sign. The next day\r\nwe went out to bring it in, and we got another at the same time. There\r\nwas excitement among the dogs when they got fresh meat, to say nothing\r\nof fresh blubber. Nor were we men inclined to say no to a fresh steak.\r\n\r\nOn September 27 we removed the roof that had covered over the window\r\nof our room. We had to carry the light down through a long wooden\r\nchannel, so that it was considerably reduced by the time it came in;\r\nbut it was light -- genuine daylight -- and it was much appreciated.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th Camilla came back, after an absence of ten days. She had\r\nbeen let loose sixty-eight miles from Framheim on the last trip. When\r\nshe came in, she was as fat as ever; probably she had been feasting\r\nin her solitude on one of her comrades. She was received with great\r\novations by her many admirers.\r\n\r\nOn September 29 a still more certain sign of spring appeared --\r\na flight of Antarctic petrels. They came flying up to us to bring\r\nthe news that now spring had come -- this time in earnest. We were\r\ndelighted to see these fine, swift birds again. They flew round\r\nthe house several times to see whether we were all there still;\r\nand we were not long in going out to receive them. It was amusing\r\nto watch the dogs: at first the birds flew pretty near the ground;\r\nwhen the dogs caught sight of them, they rushed out -- the whole\r\nlot of them -- to catch them. They tore along, scouring the ground,\r\nand, of course, all wanted to be first. Then the birds suddenly rose\r\ninto the air, and presently the dogs lost sight of them. They stood\r\nstill for a moment, glaring at each other, evidently uncertain of\r\nwhat was the best thing to do. Such uncertainty does not, as a rule,\r\nlast long. They made up their minds with all desirable promptitude\r\nand flew at each other's throats.\r\n\r\nSo now spring had really arrived; we had only to cure the frost-bitten\r\nheels and then away.\r\n\r\nEnd of Vol. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] -- Fram means \"forward,\" \"out of,\" \"through.\" -- Tr.\r\n\r\n[2] -- This retrospective chapter has here been greatly condensed, as\r\nthe ground is already covered, for English readers, by Dr. H.
