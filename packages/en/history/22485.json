In the present\r\ncase the problem has reappeared in every chapter, for Devon is 'a fair\r\nprovince,' as Prince says in his 'Worthies of Devon,' and 'the happy\r\nparent of ... a noble offspring.'\r\n\r\nMy position is that of a person who has been bidden to take from a great\r\nheap of precious stones as many as are needed to make one chain; for\r\nhowever grasping that person may be, and however long the chain may be\r\nmade, when all the stones have been chosen, the heap will look almost as\r\ngreat and delightful as before: only a few of the largest and brightest\r\njewels will be gone.\r\n\r\nThe fact that I have been able to take only a small handful from the\r\nvast hoard that constitutes the history of Devon will explain, I hope,\r\nthe many omissions that must strike every reader who has any knowledge\r\nof the county--omissions of which no one can be more conscious than\r\nmyself. A separate volume might very well be written about the bit of\r\ncountry touched on in each chapter.\r\n\r\nThis book does not pretend to include every district. I have merely\r\npassed through a great part of the county, stopping here at an old\r\nchurch with interesting monuments, there at a small town whose share in\r\nlocal history--in some instances, in the country's history--is apt to be\r\nforgotten, or at a manor-house which should be remembered for its\r\nassociation with one of the many 'worthies' who, as Prince says--with\r\nthe true impartiality of a West-countryman in regard to his own\r\ncounty--form 'an illustrious troop of heroes, as no other county in the\r\nkingdom, no other kingdom (in so small a tract) in Europe, in all\r\nrespects, is able to match, much less excel.'\r\n\r\nFrom the 'Tale of Two Swannes,' a view of the banks of the River Lea,\r\npublished in 1590, I have ventured to borrow the verses that close an\r\naddress 'To the Reader':\r\n\r\n    'To tell a Tale, and tell the Trueth withall,\r\n    To write of waters, and with them of land,\r\n    To tell of Rivers, where they rise and fall,\r\n    To tell where Cities, Townes, and Castles stand,\r\n        To tell their names, both old and newe,\r\n        With other things that be most true,\r\n\r\n    'Argues a Tale that tendeth to some good,\r\n    Argues a Tale that hath in it some reason,\r\n    Argues a Tale, if it be understood,\r\n    As looke the like, and you shall find it geason.\r\n        If, when you reade, you find it so,\r\n        Commend the worke and let it goe.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContents\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sonnet by Henry Newbolt                                       _page_ v\r\n\r\n  Preface                                                            vii\r\n\r\n  _Chap._ I.

When last I was at Exeter,\r\n    The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,\r\n    And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,\r\n    Because a bard of Ireland told me once,\r\n    I should not live long after I saw Richmond.'\r\n\r\n    _King Richard III._, Act IV, Sc. ii.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are not many towns which stir the imagination as much as Exeter.\r\nTo all West-Countrymen she is a Mother City ... and there is not one\r\namong them, however long absent from the West, who does not feel, when\r\nhe sets foot in Exeter, that he is at home again, in touch with people\r\nof his own blood and kindred.... In Exeter all the history of the West\r\nis bound up--its love of liberty, its independence, its passionate\r\nresistance to foreign conquerors, its devotion to lost causes, its\r\nloyalty to the throne, its pride, its trade, its maritime adventure--all\r\nthese many strands are twined together in that bond which links\r\nWest-Countrymen to Exeter.' Mr Norway is a West-Countryman, and he sums\r\nup very justly the sentiment, more or less consciously realized, of the\r\npeople for whom he speaks, and especially the feeling of the citizens.\r\n\r\nNot only the Cathedral, the Castle, and Guildhall, bear legends for\r\nthose who know how to read them, but here and again through all the\r\nstreets an ancient house, a name, or a tower, will bring back the memory\r\nof one of the stirring events that have happened. One royal pageant\r\nafter another has clattered and glittered through the streets, and the\r\nold carved gabled houses in the side-lanes must many a time have shaken\r\nto the heavy tramp of armed men, gathered to defend the city or to march\r\nout against the enemy.\r\n\r\n'Exeter,' says Professor Freeman, 'stands distinguished as the one great\r\nEnglish city which has, in a more marked way than any other, kept its\r\nunbroken being and its unbroken position throughout all ages. It is the\r\none city in which we can feel sure that human habitation and city life\r\nhave never ceased from the days of the early Cæsars to our own.... The\r\ncity on the Exe, Caerwisc, or Isca Damnoniorum, has had a history which\r\ncomes nearer than that of any other city of Britain to the history of\r\nthe ancient local capitals of the kindred land of Gaul.... To this day,\r\nboth in feeling and in truth, Exeter is something more than an ordinary\r\ncounty town.'\r\n\r\nThe city is very picturesquely placed, and before ruthless\r\n'improvements' swept away the old gates and many ancient buildings, the\r\ngeneral effect must have been particularly delightful. 'This City is\r\npleasantly seated upon a Hill among Hills, saving towards the sea, where\r\n'tis pendant in such sort as that the streets (be they never so foul)\r\nyet with one shower of rain are again cleansed ...,' wrote Izacke, in\r\nhis _Antiquities of Exeter_. 'Very beautiful is the same in building;'\r\nand he ends with some vagueness, 'for considerable Matters matchable to\r\nmost Cities in _England_.' The earliest history can only be guessed at\r\nfrom what is known of the history of other places, and from the\r\ninferences to be drawn from a few scanty relics; but there is evidence\r\nthat Exeter existed as a British settlement before the Romans found\r\ntheir way so far West. It is not known when they took the city, nor when\r\nthey abandoned it, nor is there any date to mark the West Saxon\r\noccupation. Professor Freeman, however, points out a very interesting\r\ncharacteristic proving that the conquest cannot have taken place until\r\nafter the Saxons had ceased to be heathens. 'It is the one great city of\r\nthe Roman and the Briton which did not pass into English hands till the\r\nstrife of races had ceased to be a strife of creeds, till English\r\nconquest had come to mean simply conquest, and no longer meant havoc and\r\nextermination. It is the one city of the present England in which we can\r\nsee within recorded times the Briton and Englishman living side by\r\nside.' In the days of Athelstan, 'Exeter was not purely English; it was\r\na city of two nations and two tongues.... This shows that ... its\r\nBritish inhabitants obtained very favourable terms from the conquerors,\r\nand that, again, is much the same as saying that it was not taken till\r\nafter the West Saxons had become Christians.'\r\n\r\nThe earliest reliable records of the city begin about 876, when the\r\nDanes overwhelmed the city and were put to flight by King Alfred. A few\r\nyears later they again besieged Exeter, but this time it held out\r\nagainst them until the King, for the second time, came to the rescue,\r\nand the enemy retreated. Alfred, careful of the city and its means of\r\ndefence, built a stronghold--very possibly in the interval between these\r\ntwo invasions--upon the high ground that the Briton had chosen for his\r\nfastness, and on which the Castle rose in after-days. Rather more than a\r\nhundred years later Athelstan strengthened the city by repairing the\r\nRoman walls. But it is with an event of greater importance that\r\nAthelstan's name is usually associated, for it was he who made the city\r\na purely English one by driving out all the Britons into the country\r\nbeyond the Tamar. It is probable that there was already a monastery in\r\nExeter in the seventh century, and that it was broken up during the\r\nstorms that raged later. In any case, Athelstan founded or refounded a\r\nmonastery, and in 968 Edgar, who had married the beautiful daughter of\r\nOrdgar, Earl of Devon, settled a colony of monks in Exeter. About thirty\r\nyears afterwards the Danes, under Pallig, sailed up the Exe and laid\r\nsiege to the town, but were repulsed with great courage by the citizens.\r\nBeaten off the city, they fell upon the country round, and a frightful\r\nbattle was fought at Pinhoe. A curious memorial of it survives to this\r\nday. During the furious struggle the Saxons' ammunition began to run\r\nlow, and the priest of Pinhoe rode back to Exeter for a fresh supply of\r\narrows. In recognition of his service, the perpetual pension of a mark\r\n(13s. 4d.) was granted him, and this sum the Vicar of the parish still\r\nreceives. Two years later the Danes made a successful assault upon the\r\ncity, and seized much plunder, but made no stay.\r\n\r\nEdward the Confessor visited Exeter, and assisted at the installation of\r\nLeofric as first Bishop of Exeter, when the see was transferred from\r\nCrediton. The Queen also played a prominent part in the ceremony, for\r\nExeter and the royal revenues within it made part of her 'morning gift.'\r\nLeofric instituted several reforms, added to the wealth of his\r\ncathedral, and left it a legacy of lands and books. The most interesting\r\nof the manuscripts is the celebrated _Exeter Book_, a large collection\r\nof Anglo-Saxon poems on very different subjects. To give some idea of\r\ntheir variety, it may be mentioned that, amongst other poems of an\r\nentirely distinct character, there are religious pieces, many riddles,\r\nthe legends of two saints, the Scald's or Ancient Minstrel's tale of his\r\ntravels, and a poem on the 'Various Fortunes of Men.'\r\n\r\nSeventeen years after King Edward's visit, William the Conqueror's\r\nmessengers came before the chief men of Exeter demanding their\r\nsubmission. But the citizens sent back the lofty answer that 'they would\r\nacknowledge William as Emperor of Britain; they would not receive him as\r\ntheir immediate King. They would pay him the tribute which they had been\r\nused to pay to Kings of the English, but that should be all. They would\r\nswear no oaths to him; they would not receive him within their walls.'\r\nWilliam naturally would not listen to conditions, and arrived to direct\r\nthe siege in person. For eighteen days the repeated attacks of the\r\nNormans were sturdily resisted; then the enemy dug a mine, which caused\r\nthe walls to crumble, and surrender was inevitable. 'The Red Mount of\r\nExeter had been the stronghold of Briton, Roman, and Englishman;' under\r\nthe hands of the Norman here rose the Castle of Rougemont, of which a\r\ntower, a gateway, and part of the walls, stand to this day. In\r\nproportion to the size and strength of that castle, however, the remains\r\nare inconsiderable, but it fell into decay very long ago, and as early\r\nas 1681 Izacke writes of 'the Fragments of the ancient Buildings\r\nruinated, whereon time ... hath too much Tyrannized.'\r\n\r\nIn the year after King Stephen began to reign, Baldwin de Redvers, Earl\r\nof Devon and keeper of the Castle, declared for the Empress Maud, and\r\nheld the Castle for three months against the citizens, headed by two\r\nhundred knights who had been sent by the King. At the end of this time\r\nthe wells ran dry, so that the besieged were driven to use wine for\r\ntheir cookery, and even to throw over their 'engines,' set on fire by\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nHenry II granted to the citizens of Exeter the first of their many\r\ncharters of privileges, and in the reigns of King John and Henry III the\r\nmunicipal system was very much developed, and the city first had a\r\nMayor. Under Edward I a beginning was made towards the almost entire\r\nreconstruction of the Cathedral. Bishop Warelwast, the nephew of William\r\nI, had raised the transeptal towers--a feature that no other English\r\ncathedral possesses--and since his time the Lady Chapel had been added,\r\nbut the design of the Cathedral as a whole was evolved by Bishop Quivil.\r\nHe planned what was practically a new church, and his intentions were\r\nfaithfully carried out. Before his day the towers were merely 'external\r\ncastles,' but Bishop Quivil broke down their inner walls, and filled the\r\nspace with lofty arches, and the towers became transepts. Bishop\r\nStapledon spent huge sums in collecting materials, but before much\r\nprogress with the work had been made he was murdered by a London mob, in\r\nthe troubled reign of Edward II; and the actual existence of much of the\r\nbuilding is due to Bishop Grandisson, who, sparing himself in no matter,\r\nlavished treasure and devotion on his Cathedral. Writing to Pope John\r\nXXII, the Bishop said 'that if the church should be worthily completed,\r\nit would be admired for its beauty above every other of its kind within\r\nthe realms of England or France.'\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful features of the Cathedral is the unbroken\r\nlength of roof at the same height through nave and choir, the effect\r\nintensified by the exquisite richness and grace of the vaulting. And the\r\nspreading fans gain an added grace, springing as they do from that\r\n'distinctive group of shafts' which, says Canon Edmonds, 'makes the\r\nExeter pillar the very type of the union of beauty and strength.' In the\r\ncentral bay of the nave, on the north side, is the Minstrels' Gallery,\r\none of the few to be found in England. It is delicately and elaborately\r\nsculptured, and each of the twelve angels in the niches holds a musical\r\ninstrument--a flageolet, a trumpet and two wind instruments, a tambour,\r\na violin, an organ, a harp, bagpipes, the cymbals, and guitars.\r\n\r\nThe choir is unusually long, and from the north and south aisles open\r\nchapels and chantries, in some of which the carving is very rich and\r\nfine. The Bishop's throne is elaborately carved, and more than sixty\r\nfeet high, and yet there is not one nail in it. During the Commonwealth\r\na brick wall was built across the west end of the choir, completely\r\ndividing the Cathedral. This was done to satisfy the Presbyterians and\r\nIndependents, each of whom wished to hold their services here, and the\r\ntwo churches formed by this division were called Peter the East and\r\nPeter the West. The screen in the west front was added after the\r\nCathedral was finished; it is covered with statues in niches, figures of\r\n'kings, warriors, saints, and apostles, guardians as it were of the\r\nentrance to the sanctuary.' High above them, in the gable niche, is the\r\nstatue of St Peter, to whom the Cathedral is dedicated.\r\n\r\nKing Edward and Queen Eleanor kept Christmas at Exeter in 1285, and here\r\nthe King held the Parliament which passed the Statute of Coroners that\r\nis still law. During this visit the King gave leave to the Bishop and\r\nChapter to surround the close with a wall and gates, for at this time it\r\nwas used to heap rubbish upon, and 'the rendezvous of all the bad\r\ncharacters of the place.' Edward III granted his eldest son the Duchy of\r\nCornwall--a grant that carried with it the Castle of Exeter, and to the\r\nKing's eldest son it has always since belonged.\r\n\r\nHenry VI in 1482 visited the city in peace and splendour. Margaret, his\r\nQueen, came about eighteen years later, while Warwick's plans were\r\nripening, and the event is marked in the Receiver's accounts by the\r\nentry: 'Two bottles of wine given to John Fortescue, before the coming\r\nof Margaret, formerly Queen.' Not long afterwards Warwick and the Duke\r\nof Clarence fled to Exeter, which had to stand a siege on their behalf;\r\nbut the effort to take the city was half-hearted, and in twelve days the\r\nattempt was abandoned. Edward IV arrived in pursuit, but too late, for\r\n'the byrdes were flown and gone away,' and a quaint farce was solemnly\r\nplayed out. The city had just shown openly that its real sympathies were\r\nLancastrian, but neither King nor citizens could afford to quarrel.\r\n'Both sides put the best face on matters; the city was loyal; the King\r\nwas gracious ... the citizens gave him a full purse, and he gave them a\r\nsword, and all parted friends.'\r\n\r\nRichard III's visit was more eventful. The allegiance yielded him by the\r\nWest was of the flimsiest character, and in the autumn of 1483 a\r\nconspiracy was formed, and Henry, Earl of Richmond, was proclaimed King\r\nin Exeter. Here Richard hastened at the head of a strong force, to find\r\nthat nearly all the leaders had fled, and there remained only his\r\nbrother-in-law, Sir John St Leger, and Sir John's Esquire, Thomas Rame.\r\nSo the King 'provided for himself a characteristic entertainment,' and\r\nboth knight and squire were beheaded opposite the Guildhall. Before he\r\nleft, Richard went to look at the Castle, and asked its name. The Mayor\r\nanswered, 'Rougemont'--a word misunderstood by the King, who became\r\n'suddenly fallen into a great dump, and as it were a man amazed.'\r\nShakespeare's lines give the explanation of his discomfiture. 'It\r\nseems,' comments Fuller, 'Sathan either spoke this oracle low or\r\nlisping.'\r\n\r\nThe next siege of Exeter was when the followers of Perkin Warbeck surged\r\nin thousands round the city. Their assault was vigorous and determined;\r\nthey tried to undermine the walls, burned the north gate, and, repulsed\r\nat this point, broke through the defences at the east gate. After a\r\nsharp struggle in the streets, the rebels were thrust back, and were\r\nforced to march northwards, leaving Exeter triumphant. Three weeks later\r\nHenry VII entered Exeter with Warbeck, as his prisoner. The King was\r\nvery gracious to the city that had just given such eminent proofs of its\r\nloyalty, and bestowed on the citizens a second sword of honour and a cap\r\nof maintenance, and ordered that a sword-bearer should be appointed to\r\ncarry the sword before the Mayor in civic procession.\r\n\r\nHenry VIII gave Exeter 'the highest privilege,' says Professor Freeman,\r\n'that can be given to an English city or borough.' He made it a county,\r\n'with all the rights of a county under its own Sheriff.' An Act of\r\nParliament was also passed to undo the harm done by Isabel de Fortibus,\r\nrepresentative of the Earls of Devon, when she made a weir about the\r\nyear 1280--still called Countess Weir--that blocked the free waterway to\r\nthe sea. As the tide naturally comes up the river a little way beyond\r\nExeter, before the weir was made ships had been able to sail up to the\r\nwatergate of the city. The first attempts to improve matters after this\r\nAct was passed failed, but a canal was constructed with tolerable\r\nsuccess in the reign of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nIn 1549 came the siege of Exeter that followed the burning of Crediton\r\nbarns. The Devonshire rebels had been reinforced by a large number of\r\nCornishmen, who resented the new Prayer-Book, and the law obliging them\r\nto hear the services in English instead of Latin, more bitterly and with\r\ngreater reason than the people of Sampford Courtenay. For to them it was\r\nmore than unwelcome change in the Liturgy; it meant also that their\r\nservices were read in an alien tongue. 'We,' the Cornish, 'whereof\r\ncertain of us _understand no English_, utterly refuse the new English,'\r\nwas their protest. It is curious to think that more than half a century\r\nlater English was a foreign language in Cornwall. In James I's reign,\r\n'John Norden ... constructing his _Speculum_, his topographical\r\ndescription of this kingdom,' writes: 'Of late the Cornishmen have muche\r\nconformed themselves to the use of the English tongue;' and adds that\r\nall but 'some obscure people' are able to 'convers with a straunger' in\r\nEnglish. The bitterness aroused by the religious question was\r\nintensified by a report which was 'blazed abroad,' as Hooker says, 'a\r\nGnat making an Elephant, that the gentlemen were altogether bent to\r\nover-run, spoil, or destroy the people.' No one could have acted with\r\ngreater loyalty and courage than the Mayor, John Blackaller, and his\r\npowers were put to a hard trial before the end of the siege. Not only\r\nwas there an active and vigorous enemy without, but within the walls the\r\nmajority secretly, and some persons openly, sided with the enemy. The\r\nmost unceasing vigilance and unfaltering resolution were needed to\r\nfrustrate all plots and plans. One great danger was averted by a certain\r\nJohn Newcomb, an ex-miner, who, suspicious of a possible peril, watched\r\ndiligently for its slightest sign. One day an anxious crowd looked at\r\nhim 'crawling about on the ground with a pan of water in his hand. Every\r\nnow and again he would listen attentively, with his ear in the dust,\r\nand, rising, place the pan on the spot. At last he has it. Like the\r\nbeating of a pulse, the still water in the pan vibrates in harmony with\r\nthe stroke of the pickaxe far underneath, and the old miner rises\r\nexultant.' A counter-mine was hurriedly made, and through a tiny opening\r\nit was seen that barrels of gunpowder and pitch and piles of faggots\r\nwere heaped beneath the west gate. Fortunately, this gate stood below\r\nthe steep slope on which the city lies, and on discovering the enemy's\r\nalarming preparations, every householder was ordered, at a given signal,\r\nto empty a great tub of water into the kennel, and every tap in the city\r\nwas turned on. 'At which time also, by the Goodness of God, there fell a\r\ngreat Shower, as the like, for the Time, had not been seen many years\r\nbefore.' A tremendous torrent rushed down the streets, and, being\r\nconcentrated upon the mine, completely flooded it.\r\n\r\nThere is no place here to speak of the straits to which the citizens\r\nwere put before a sufficient number of troops reached Lord Russell to\r\nenable him to march to the relief of the besieged. Nor is there room for\r\nan account of the splendid resistance made by the rebels to the great\r\nforce pitted against them, which included a regiment of seasoned German\r\n_Lanzknechts_ and three hundred Italian musketeers, besides English\r\ncavalry. 'Valiantly and stoutly they stood to their Tackle, and would\r\nnot give over as long as Life and Limb lasted ... and few or none were\r\nleft alive.... Such was the Valour and stoutness of these men that the\r\nLord Greie reported himself, that he never, in all the Wars that he had\r\nbeen in, did know the like.'\r\n\r\nIn recognition of the loyalty shown by the citizens under this great\r\ntrial, Queen Elizabeth 'complimented the city with an augmentation of\r\narms,' and 'of her own free will added the well-known motto, _Semper\r\nFidelis_.' Encouraged by the Queen's protection, commerce increased and\r\nprospered. Guilds had long flourished in Exeter, and it is recorded that\r\nas early as 1477 there was a quarrel between the Mayor and citizens and\r\nthe Company of Taylors. A Guildhall existed even before there was a\r\nMayor of Exeter, but the present building dates from 1464. It has a fine\r\ncommon hall, with a lofty, vaulted roof and much panelling, and the\r\npanels are set with little shields, the arms of the Mayors, of various\r\ncompanies, and certain benefactors to the city. Later was added the\r\ncinque-cento front that projects over the footway, and has become so\r\nessential a characteristic in the eyes of those who care for Exeter.\r\nThis front was built in 1593, and 'in its confusion of styles--English\r\nwindows between Italian columns--it has all the impress of that\r\ntransitional age.'\r\n\r\nMany of the trades that throve in Exeter formed guilds, and in looking\r\ncasually at the names of a few of them, one finds that the bakers had\r\nalready a Master and Company in 1428-29, and that some years later the\r\ncharter of the Glovers and Skinners was renewed. In 1452 there was a\r\ndispute as to whether the Cordwainers or Tuckers should take precedence\r\nin the Mayor's procession, and later again the Guild of Weavers,\r\nSheremen, and Tuckers came still more prominently before the public.\r\n\r\n'Trafiquing' in wool and woollen goods was the most important trade, and\r\nthough its zenith was passed in the seventeenth century, it continued to\r\ndo well till the later half of the eighteenth. Defoe speaks of the\r\n'serge manufacture of Devonshire' as 'a trade too great to be described\r\nin miniature,' and says he is told that at the weekly market 'sixty to\r\nseventy to eighty, and sometimes a hundred, thousand pounds' value in\r\nserges is sometimes sold.' Probably the account given him was a little\r\nexaggerated, but Lysons quotes the statement that in the most prosperous\r\ndays £50,000 or £60,000 worth of woollen goods had been sold in a week.\r\nMany were the petitions sent up to Parliament in the reign of William\r\nand Mary, begging protection for the local wool-trade, and that\r\ncompetition from unhappy Ireland might be discouraged. The great hall of\r\nthe New Inn was used as an exchange, and here were held yearly three\r\ngreat cloth-fairs, where merchants from London and from all parts\r\ngathered, and stalls and shops in the inn were let to 'foreigners.' The\r\nTuckers' Hall, built of ruddy stone, still stands in Fore Street, and\r\nthe hall has a fine cradle roof with plaster panels.\r\n\r\nThe most powerful of all the companies was incorporated later than many\r\nof the guilds, for the Merchant Adventurers received their charter from\r\nQueen Elizabeth. Their power and wealth was very considerable; they\r\ncast their lines in all directions, and they secured a monopoly of\r\ntrading with France. This company supplied with money, and had a stake\r\nin, some of Sir Humphrey Gilbert's and Captain Davis's enterprises, and\r\nSir Francis Drake himself invited the 'gentilmen merchauntes' and others\r\nof the city to 'adventure with him in a voiage supportinge some speciall\r\nservice ... for the defence of 'religion, Quene and countrye.'' About\r\nCharles I's reign the importance of the company gradually declined, and\r\nthe society was eventually dissolved.\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil War, Exeter was twice besieged, but on neither occasion\r\nso rigorously as in 1549. When the war broke out, the Earl of Bedford\r\nappointed the Mayor, the Sheriff, and five Aldermen, Commissioners for\r\nthe Parliament. The defences were put in order and arms collected, and\r\namongst other expenses is recorded '£300 for 17 packs of wool taken from\r\nMr Robin's Cellars for the Barricadoes.' Nevertheless, zeal for the\r\nParliament must have been but lukewarm, for when Prince Maurice's troops\r\nsurrounded the city, it was surrendered at the end of fourteen days, and\r\nafter the besieged had suffered no further inconvenience than 'the being\r\nkept from taking the air without their own walls.' The next year Queen\r\nHenrietta Maria came to a city which was considered a safer refuge than\r\nOxford, and here Princess Henrietta was born, and was baptized in the\r\nCathedral with great pomp, 'a new font having been erected for the\r\npurpose, surmounted by a rich canopy of state.' Charles II always showed\r\nthe warmest affection for his sister, famed, as Duchess of Orleans, for\r\nher beauty and charm, and a portrait of the Princess given by the King\r\nto the city hangs in the Guildhall. It is a full-length portrait, and\r\nshe is represented standing, one hand lightly gathering together the\r\nfolds of her white satin dress.\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn and winter of 1645-46 Exeter was gradually hemmed in\r\nby bodies of Parliamentary troops stationed at posts in the\r\nneighbourhood, and with the new year the siege became a closer one. It\r\nwould seem, however, that there was no very acute distress from lack of\r\nfood; but Fuller, who was in the city at the time, mentions with\r\nsatisfaction the appearance of 'an incredible number of Larks ... for\r\nmultitude like Quails in the Wildernesse, and as fat as plentifull ...\r\nwhich provided a feast for many poor people, who otherwise had been\r\npinched for provision.' As the spring advanced, the King's cause lapsed\r\ninto a condition too hopeless to be bettered by further resistance, and\r\non April 9 Sir John Berkeley, for over two years the faithful guardian\r\nof the city, signed the articles of its surrender, on honourable terms,\r\nto Sir Thomas Fairfax.\r\n\r\nThere is no space to speak of later dramatic incidents in Exeter--the\r\ntrial and execution of Mr Penruddocke and Mr Grove, leaders of a\r\nRoyalist rising of Wiltshire gentlemen, whose speeches on the scaffold\r\nare given at length by Izacke; nor of the joy that greeted the\r\nRestoration, when 'Tar-barrels and Bonefires capered aloft'; nor of\r\nCharles II's visit, nor the entrance of the Duke of Monmouth in 1680\r\nwith five thousand horsemen, and nine hundred young men in white\r\nuniforms marching before him. One may not even pause before the gorgeous\r\nspectacle of William III's arrival, heralded by a procession in which\r\nappeared two hundred negroes in white-plumed, embroidered turbans, and a\r\nsquadron of Swedish horsemen 'in bearskins taken from the beasts they\r\nhad slain, with black armour and broad flaming swords.'\r\n\r\nIt has been only possible to name the most outstanding points in the\r\nhistory of a city--once more to quote Professor Freeman--'by the side of\r\nwhich most of the capitals of Europe are things of yesterday.... The\r\ncity alike of Briton, Roman, and Englishman, the one great prize of the\r\nChristian Saxon, the city where Jupiter gave way to Christ, but where\r\nChrist never gave way to Woden--British Caerwisc, Roman Isca, West Saxon\r\nExeter, may well stand first on our roll-call of English cities. Others\r\ncan boast of a fuller share of modern greatness; none other can trace up\r\na life so unbroken to so remote a past.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe Exe\r\n\r\n            'Goodly Ex, who from her full-fed spring\r\n    Her little Barlee hath, and Dunsbrook her to bring\r\n    From Exmore; when she hath scarcely found her course,\r\n    Then Creddy cometh in ...\r\n                            ... her sovereign to assist;\r\n    As Columb wins for Ex clear Wever and the Clist,\r\n    Contributing their streams their mistress' fame to raise.\r\n    As all assist the Ex, so Ex consumeth these;\r\n    Like some unthrifty youth, depending on the court,\r\n    To win an idle name, that keeps a needless port;\r\n    And raising his old rent, exacts his farmers' store\r\n    The landlord to enrich, the tenants wondrous poor:\r\n    Who having lent him theirs, he then consumes his own,\r\n    That with most vain expense upon the Prince is thrown:\r\n    So these, the lesser brooks unto the greater pay;\r\n    The greater, they again spend all upon the sea.'\r\n\r\n    DRAYTON: _Poly-olbion_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe river Exe rises in a bog on Exmoor, beyond the borders of\r\nSomersetshire. 'Be now therefore pleased as you stand upon Great\r\nVinnicombe top ... to cast your eye westward, and you may see the first\r\nspring of the river Exe, which welleth forth in a valley between\r\nPinckerry and Woodborough,' says Westcote.\r\n\r\nBut our author has no feeling for the rolling hills, and noble lines,\r\nand hazy blue distances of Exmoor, and without one word of praise\r\ncontinues: 'Let us for your more ease, and the sooner to be quit of this\r\nbarren soil, cold air, uneven ways, and untrodden paths, swim with the\r\nstream the better to hasten our speed.'\r\n\r\nThe first little town that the Exe comes to in Devonshire is Bampton,\r\nnowadays best known, perhaps, for its pony-fairs, when (so runs one\r\naccount) 'Exmoor ponies throng the streets, flood the pavements,\r\noverflow the houses, pervade the place. Wild as hawks, active and lissom\r\nas goats, cajoled from the moors, and tactfully manoeuvred when\r\npenned, these indigenous quadrupeds will leap or escalade lofty barriers\r\nin a standing jump or a cat-like scramble.' Cattle and sheep are less\r\nconspicuously for sale at this popular and crowded fair, held on the\r\nlast Thursday in October.\r\n\r\nThe first fact recorded of Bampton's history is of such ancient date\r\nthat it may be hoped the vastness of the achievement has been rounded\r\nand filled out during the flight of time; for the historian, with\r\nunconscious irony, blandly remarks that here 'Cynegils, first Christian\r\nKing of the West Saxons,' put twenty thousand (or maybe more) Britons to\r\nthe sword. He does not mention how Cynegils continued his propagation of\r\nthe Gospel.\r\n\r\nThe nave of the church at Bampton is built in the manner most common to\r\nthis country--that is, early Perpendicular, but the chancel is\r\nDecorated. In many of the churches there is some portion of Decorated\r\nwork. The screen and roof of the church are worth seeing, and in the\r\nchurchyard are several unusually large and fine old yew-trees, one or\r\ntwo girdled by stone benches. Leaving Bampton, one passes along a green\r\nand fertile valley, the fields interrupted at intervals by copses, where\r\nthickets of undergrowth and multitudes of young saplings are struggling\r\nfor the mastery--a picture of prodigal wealth in plants, bushes, and\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nSeven miles to the south is Tiverton. Tiverton is a small town, but its\r\nstory is interesting, and incidents cluster round the castle, church,\r\nthe well-known school, and the former kersies and wool-market, and,\r\nbesides, it is filled with memories of the melancholy experiences it has\r\npassed through--fires, floods, the plague, and at least one siege.\r\n\r\nThe borough was originally granted by Henry I to his cousin, Richard de\r\nRiparis (or de Redvers or Rivers), Earl of Devon, whose descendants\r\npossessed it for nearly two centuries, when, the direct line failing,\r\nthe borough and title passed to a cousin, a Courtenay, in whose family\r\nthe title still remains.\r\n\r\nRichard de Redvers, 'the faithful and beloved counsellor' of Henry I, is\r\nsupposed to have begun the Castle of Tiverton, and he attached to it\r\n'two parks for pleasure and large and rich demesne for hospitality.' His\r\ngrandson, William Rivers, was one of the four Earls who carried the\r\nsilken canopy at the second coronation of King Richard I, after his\r\nreturn from Palestine. William's daughter, Mary, married Robert\r\nCourtenay, Baron of Okehampton; and so it was that, when the House of\r\nRivers became extinct in the male line, their possessions passed to the\r\nCourtenays, and Mary's great-grandson became first Earl of Devon of the\r\nline of the Courtenays.\r\n\r\nIt is not thought probable that the Castle as it stands contains work\r\nolder than the fourteenth century. Part of the building of that date\r\nremains unaltered, and part has been transformed into a modern house.\r\nThe old walls are in places covered with ivy, and on the southern side\r\nare pierced by one or two pointed windows whose stonework is more or\r\nless broken. A round tower at the southeastern angle still looks very\r\nsolid and undisturbed. At a few yards' distance, on the south of the\r\nCastle, stand the ruins of the chapel; the walls of three sides are\r\nstill standing, although imperfect and partly fallen down, and almost\r\nsmothered in ivy. Originally this square tower at the south-west angle\r\nwas joined to the Castle, and two more round towers stood at the\r\nnorthern angles. Near the chapel is a low wall, and looking over it one\r\nsees a very steep slope to the river, sixty feet beneath. A wide and\r\ndeep moat surrounded the Castle on the other sides.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Tiverton suffered both in the Civil War of 1150 and also\r\nin the Wars of the Roses, and though there is little evidence to support\r\nthis assertion, there can be no doubt that indirectly the town must have\r\nbeen disagreeably affected. For Baldwin de Redvers fortified his castle\r\nat Exeter, and it is very likely that retainers from Tiverton were sent\r\nto strengthen the garrison; and when the Earl was driven from the\r\ncountry by King Stephen, his servants and their families were probably\r\ndistressed by want, if not by the sword.\r\n\r\nDuring the Wars of the Roses, three successive Earls of Devon lost their\r\nlives, and many of their followers must have fallen too, leaving\r\ndefenceless widows and children.\r\n\r\nThe Earls of Devon had many manors, but lived much in their Castle at\r\nTiverton, and some were buried in the adjoining church of St Peter. To\r\nthe third Earl, known as 'the Good' or 'the Blind' Earl, and his wife a\r\ntomb was erected, 'having their effigies of alabaster, sometimes\r\nsumptuously gilded.' So writes Risdon, about the year 1630, and adds\r\nregretfully, 'Time hath not so much defaced, as men have mangled that\r\nmagnificent monument.' It has now entirely disappeared. The epitaph it\r\nbore was this:\r\n\r\n    'Hoe! Hoe! who lyes here?\r\n    'Tis I, the goode erle of Devonshire,\r\n    With Mabill, my wyfe, to mee full dere,\r\n    Wee lyved togeather fyfty fyve yere.\r\n    That wee spent wee had;\r\n    That wee lefte wee loste;\r\n    That wee gave, wee have.'\r\n\r\nThe church is a fine Perpendicular building, and has a high embattled\r\ntower, with slender crocketed pinnacles springing sixteen feet above the\r\nsummit. The roof is battlemented, and the tracery in the windows is\r\ngraceful. On either side of the chancel stands an altar-tomb--that on\r\nthe north side being in memory of John Waldron, on the south of George\r\nSlee, both benefactors to the town in having founded almshouses. The\r\nsides of the tombs are boldly and curiously sculptured, being covered\r\nwith raised devices, and a deeply lettered inscription is engraved in\r\nthe top of each. A picture of St Peter being delivered by the angel from\r\nprison, painted by Richard Cosway, hangs over a north doorway. Cosway\r\nwas born in Tiverton, and the letter that accompanied his gift expressed\r\ngood feeling and his warm affection for his native town.\r\n\r\nThe most distinctive feature of the church is the very decorative\r\n'Greenway' chapel. John Greenway was a rich wool-merchant of Tiverton,\r\nand on the walls of the chapel was inscribed this couplet:\r\n\r\n    'To the honour of St. Christopher, St. Blaze, and St. Anne,\r\n    This chapel of John Greenwaye was began.'\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note, of the three saints to whom the chapel was\r\ndedicated, that St Christopher was the patron of mariners and one of the\r\n'sea-saints,' St Blaze the special patron of wool-combers; while St\r\nAnne particularly presides over riches. An old distich runs:\r\n\r\n    'Saint Anne gives wealth and living great to such as love her most,\r\n    And is a perfite finder-out of things that have beene lost.'\r\n\r\nSo that the help of all three was peculiarly necessary to make John\r\nGreenway a prosperous man!\r\n\r\nThe chapel is late Perpendicular, and it is most elaborately carved and\r\ndecorated. The roof is covered with different kinds of ornamentation,\r\nand the cornice bears the arms of Greenway, of the Drapers' Company, and\r\nother devices. Along the corbel line are carved scenes from the Bible,\r\nbeneath is a sea of gentle ripples, with several large ships in full\r\nsail upon it, and above and beside the windows is a multitude of\r\ndifferent designs--merchants' marks, animals, roses, anchors, horses and\r\nmen; and a very delightful ape sits on a projecting pedestal, close to\r\nthe porch. The porch is extremely elaborate, both within and without. On\r\nthe frieze are six panels, each carved with a different Scriptural\r\nsubject, separated from one another by single figures. Over the porch\r\nare the arms of the Courtenays, and above them an emblem and more\r\ncarving, besides two large niches, now empty, at each side of the door.\r\nInside the porch, over the door leading into the church, is a carving of\r\nthe Assumption, and the roof is richly carved with merchants' marks and\r\nother ciphers and designs on little shields. The roof inside the chapel\r\nis also carved; and in the floor is a brass engraved with the figures of\r\nthe merchant and his wife--he in a long fur-edged robe, and she wearing\r\nembroidered draperies and jewels, and a pomander ball hanging on one of\r\nthe long ends of her girdle.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to hear that in this church Mendelssohn's Wedding\r\nMarch was first played at a wedding. The 'Midsummer Night's Dream' music\r\nhad just been published as a pianoforte duet, when Mr Samuel Reay, of\r\nTiverton, made an arrangement of it for the organ, and the first\r\nmarriage at which the march was played was that of Mr Tom Daniel and\r\nMiss Dorothea Carew, in June, 1847.\r\n\r\nTiverton was famed in early days for its trade in wool. It is supposed\r\nthat woollen goods were first manufactured here towards the end of the\r\nfourteenth century, and at the beginning of the sixteenth several\r\nmerchants of the town were making ventures far and wide. Baizes, plain\r\ncloths, and kerseys were the most important of the manufactures, and\r\nthere was some commerce in these with Spain. Traffic in woollen goods\r\nwas now very brisk in different parts of the country, and during the\r\nreign of Henry VIII special statutes were enacted 'affecting cloths\r\ncalled white straits of Devon, and Devonshire kerseys called dozens.' In\r\nElizabeth's reign trade prospered here as elsewhere; but later friction\r\narose on the question of imports. The manufacturers on more than one\r\noccasion tried to introduce Irish worsted to weave into cloth, and this\r\nwas met by the most violent opposition from the wool-combers, who\r\nbelieved that it would take away their work, although it was explained\r\nthat their work depended on making serge for Dutch markets, for which\r\nthe Irish worsted could not be used. The wool-combers had at different\r\ntimes various causes for complaint, and these they vented in riots so\r\nserious that (about 1749) the authorities asked for the protection of\r\nsome troops, who were accordingly sent to Tiverton, and, on a fresh\r\nuproar not long after their arrival, were called out to quell the mob.\r\nTowards the latter half of the eighteenth century the woollen trade\r\nlanguished; but in the first quarter of the nineteenth century a new\r\nbusiness sprang up--that of producing machine-made lace and tulle.\r\n\r\nTiverton's merchants marked their prosperity in an admirable manner, for\r\nover ninety gifts in land, money, and almshouses have been made. The\r\ngifts and bequests were usually intended to benefit the poor, but in a\r\nfew cases they were for the general good. In addition there remains the\r\nmemory of about twenty 'benefactions,' many of which were 'absorbed in\r\nthe tumult of the Civil War or generally dissipated by neglect or\r\nmismanagement.' Greenway founded almshouses, as well as the aisle in the\r\nchurch, and although these dwellings have been altered to some extent,\r\nthe tiny chapel still attached to them is very picturesque. A cornice\r\ncontains twelve circles, within each a pierced quatrefoil, and in the\r\ncentre of every quatrefoil a shield, bearing a coat of arms, a\r\nmerchant's mark, or other design. The cornice is supported by several\r\nrather grotesque animals, and below, in stone letters, this legend:\r\n\r\n    'Have Grace, ye men, and ever pray\r\n    For the Sowl of John and Jone Greenway.'\r\n\r\nA wide moulded arch forms the doorway, and above are coats of arms and\r\nan eagle rising from a bundle of sticks, an emblem attached to the\r\nCourtenay arms that appears in several parts of St Peter's Church.\r\n\r\nOn Waldron's almshouses is this curious inscription:\r\n\r\n    'John Waldron, merchant, and Richord his wife,\r\n    Builded this house in tyme of their life;\r\n    At such tyme as the walls wer fourtyne foote hye,\r\n    He departed this world even the eyghtynth of July (1579).\r\n\r\n          'Since youth and life doth pass awaye,\r\n           And deathe at hand to end our dayes,\r\n           Let us do so, that men may saye,\r\n           We spent our goods God for to prays.'\r\n\r\nOn one wall is a pack of wool bearing Waldron's staplemark and a ship,\r\nand below them the words, 'Remember the poor.'\r\n\r\nThe greatest gift by far was that of Peter Blundell, who built and\r\nendowed the well-known school that is called after him, and founded six\r\nscholarships at Oxford and Cambridge as a further benefit to the\r\nscholars of Blundell's. His will dictates most particular instructions\r\nregarding the salaries of the master and usher, and as to the actual\r\nbuilding, even directing that there should be 'in the kitchen one fair\r\ngreat chimney with an oven.'\r\n\r\nIn 1882 the school was transferred to Howden, but the building that\r\nPeter Blundell planned, beneath the steep hill close to the Lowman, is\r\nlong and rather low, the colour a warm, soft yellow, still more softened\r\nby stray indefinite tints of cream and buff. The slate roof is\r\nhigh-pitched, the windows are square and mullioned, and there are two\r\nporches, each with a window directly above the hooded doorway, and\r\ncrowned by a gable. The school-house stands back in a yard of plots of\r\ngrass and pebbled paths, and shaded by great old lime-trees surrounded\r\nby a high wall.\r\n\r\nSamuel Wesley was at one time head-master here, and was not universally\r\npopular, for his scathing wit blighted the esteem earned by his high\r\ngifts and principles.\r\n\r\nMany of Blundell's scholars have done good work in the world, but\r\nperhaps the most famous of them are the late Archbishop of Canterbury\r\n(Dr. Temple) and R. D. Blackmore, the novelist, who were here in the\r\n'thirties, contemporaries and friends, both 'day-boys' and lodging in\r\nthe same house in Cop's Court. Twenty years before the Archbishop came\r\nto Blundell's, that celebrated sportsman 'Jack' Russell was here,\r\nembarked on a stormy career, perpetually in scrapes due to his passion\r\nfor sport, which even led him to the point of trying to keep hounds\r\nwhile he was actually at school. Contemporaries of Blackmore's were two\r\ndistinguished soldiers and writers on military subjects, Sir Charles\r\nChesney and his brother Sir George, the author of that account of an\r\nimaginary German invasion which created so much excitement when, under\r\nthe name of 'The Battle of Dorking,' it appeared in 1871 in _Blackwood's\r\nMagazine_.\r\n\r\nFire has caused terrible loss and disaster here, for as many as seven\r\nbig conflagrations have taken place in Tiverton, and in one alone six\r\nhundred houses were destroyed, besides £200,000 worth of goods and\r\nmerchandise. In addition, at least eight smaller, but still\r\nconsiderable, fires took place at comparatively short intervals, so that\r\nbetween the years 1598 and 1788 the townsfolk suffered from this cause\r\nno fewer than fifteen times.\r\n\r\nA curious account exists of the fire in 1598--'when,' says the\r\nchronicler, 'he which at one a clocke was worth Five Thousand Pound, and\r\nas the Prophet saith [a footnote suggests the prophet Amos, vi. 5, 6]\r\ndranke his Wine in bowles of fine silver plate, had not by two a Clocke\r\nso much as a wooden dish left to eate his Meate in, nor a house to couer\r\nhis sorrowfull head, neyther did thys happen to one man alone, but to\r\nmany.... In a twinkling of an eye came that great griefe uppon them,\r\nwhich turn'd their wealth to miserable want, and their riches to\r\nunlooktfor pouertie: and how was that? Mary, Sir, by Fyer.\r\n\r\n'But no fier from heaven, no unquenchable fier such as worthily fell on\r\nthe sinfull Citie of Sodom and Gomorra; but a sillie flash of fier,\r\nblazing forth of a frying pan ... and here was dwelling in a little lowe\r\nthatcht house, a poore beggarly woman: who, with a companion, began to\r\nbake pancakes with strawe'--here he becomes sarcastic--'for their\r\nabilitie and prouission was so good that there was no wood in the house\r\nto doe it.... Sodenly, the fier got into the Pan.' Straw lying close by\r\nwas ablaze in a moment, then the roof, then, alas! by means of an\r\n'extreame high wind,' a hay-house standing near, and 'in less than halfe\r\nan hower the whole Toune was set on fier.'\r\n\r\nA terrible picture is drawn of the rapidity and voracity of the\r\nflames--people crying for help in every direction, 'insomuch that the\r\npeople were so amazed that they knew not which way to turne, nor where\r\nthe most neede was'--and of the number of people who were burned and the\r\ndesolation of the town.\r\n\r\nAs to those saved, 'the residue of the woefull people remaining yet\r\naliue, being overburdened with extream sorrow, runs up and down the\r\nfieldes like distraught or franticke men.... Moreouer, they are so\r\ngreatly distrest for lacke of food, that they seeme to each mannes\r\nsighte more liker spirits and Ghostes, than living creatures.'\r\n\r\nThe account concludes with a moral pointed in many figures of speech, to\r\nthe effect that this great trouble was a judgment on the rich, who did\r\nnot sufficiently consider their poor neighbours, and various cities are\r\nexhorted to take warning thereby. 'O famous London ... Thou which art\r\nthe chief Lady Cittie of this Land, whose fame soundeth through al\r\nChristian Kingdoms, cast thy deere eyes on this ruinous Towne....\r\nConsider this thou faire citie of Exeter, thou which art next neighbour\r\nto this distressed Town ... pitie her heauie happe, that knowes not what\r\nmiserie hanges ouer thy owne head.'\r\n\r\nAn appeal to the public was made on behalf of these sufferers, and Queen\r\nElizabeth responded with a grant of £5,000.\r\n\r\nIn the fire of 1612 the destruction was even greater. 'No noyse\r\nthundered about the streets, but fire, fire, in every place were heard\r\nthe voyces of fire.... All the night long the towne seemed like unto a\r\nburning mountaine, shooting forth fiery comets, with streaming blazes,\r\nor like unto the Canopie of the World, beset with thousands of night\r\ncandles or bright burning Torches.'\r\n\r\nWhen the Civil War broke out, Tiverton, though not unanimous, mainly\r\nsided with the Parliament. After the Battle of Stratton, however, the\r\ntriumphant Royalists suddenly descended on the town, turned out Colonel\r\nWeare, who was in command of the Parliamentary forces, and took\r\npossession. Many skirmishes must have taken place either in or about the\r\ntown, for large bodies of the troops belonging to King or Parliament\r\nmoved backwards and forwards in the immediate neighbourhood during the\r\ncourse of the war.\r\n\r\nCulpeper, the herbalist, to illustrate the powers of the plant moonwort,\r\ntells of a wonderful incident that occurred to Lord Essex's horse,\r\npresumably when his army was here in 1644. Moonwort has (or perhaps\r\n_had_) a miraculous effect on iron, with power to open locks or unshoe\r\nhorses. 'Country people that I know, call it Unshoe the Horse. Besides I\r\nhave heard commanders say, that in White Down in Devonshire, near\r\nTiverton, there were found thirty horseshoes, pulled off from the feet\r\nof the Earl of Essex's horses, being there drawn up in a body, many of\r\nthem being but newly shod, and no reason known, which caused much\r\nadmiration, and the herb described usually grows upon heaths.' Probably\r\nalmost all the neighbourhood thought witchcraft a better explanation.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult entirely to disentangle accounts that seem to\r\ncontradict each other, but apparently Essex moved away from Tiverton\r\nafter a short stay, and certainly the King sent his army to Tiverton the\r\nsame autumn to halt there for a while on its way from Plymouth to Chard.\r\nAnd as this army was returning, reduced and exhausted, from fighting and\r\nlong, hard marches in Cornwall, it could not have been sent to a town in\r\npossession of the enemy. The next year Fairfax sent General Massie to\r\ntake Tiverton. The Governor, Sir Gilbert Talbot, was in a far from happy\r\nposition, for afterwards he wrote: 'My horse were mutinous, and I had\r\nbut two hundred foot in garrison, and some of my chief officers\r\nunfaithful.' In spite of his disadvantages, he was able to repulse the\r\nenemy in their first attack on church and castle, though unable to\r\nprevent their gaining possession of the town. Two days later Fairfax\r\nhimself arrived, and batteries, furnished with 'several great Peeces,'\r\nwere erected against the church and castle. The actual fighting lasted\r\nonly a short time, for a shot broke the chain of the drawbridge, and it\r\nfell; the Parliamentary soldiers rushed across it without even waiting\r\nfor the command, and the Royalists lost their heads and their courage\r\nand fled.\r\n\r\nA copy of a letter that General Massie wrote from Tiverton to a Cheshire\r\ngentleman still exists, and in it he refers to a pamphlet, sent with the\r\nletter, even the title-page of which throws light on Puritan methods of\r\ninfluencing popular opinion against the Cavaliers. This startling page\r\nruns as follows:\r\n\r\n     A True and Strange\r\n\r\n     RELATION\r\n\r\n     of a\r\n\r\n     BOY,\r\n\r\n     Who was entertained by the Devill to be servant to him with the\r\n     consent of his Father, about Crediton in the West, and how the\r\n     Devill carried him up in the aire, and shewed him the torments of\r\n     Hell, and some of the Cavaliers there, and what preparation there\r\n     was made for Goring and Greenvile against they came.\r\n\r\n     Also how the Cavaliers went to rob a Carrier, and how the Carrier\r\n     and his Horses turned themselves into\r\n\r\n     FLAMES OF FIRE.\r\n\r\nLeaving Tiverton and following the Exe downstream, the wayfarer may\r\nponder two proverbs referring to Tiverton, neither of them especially\r\nflattering. It used to be, and no doubt is still, considered lucky to\r\nstart off running directly the cuckoo is heard for the first time in the\r\nyear, and thirty or forty years ago, if a girl obeyed this tradition,\r\nanyone near her would laugh and say: 'Run, run! and don't let no\r\nTiverton man catch you!' The other saying is cryptic: 'He must go to\r\nTiverton and ask Mr Able.' An interpretation suggested is that this was\r\noriginally said to a questioner who asked for unattainable information,\r\nand that 'Mr Able' meant anyone able to furnish it. It is not exactly a\r\nsatisfactory solution, and as to the reference to Tiverton, though it\r\nmay be complimentary, one doubts whether it does not carry more than a\r\nsuspicion of sarcasm.\r\n\r\nFour miles to the south of Tiverton is a pleasant well-wooded valley, in\r\nwhich stands Bickleigh. This village was the birthplace of a rascal, who\r\nwas such a brilliant and talented rascal that his adventures are very\r\ninteresting. Witty, courageous, and full of resource, he had, besides,\r\ntwo strong points in his favour. In spite of a very rough and wandering\r\nlife, his warm affection for his wife never failed, and--all dogs adored\r\nhim! Bampfylde Moore Carew belonged to a very old family in the West,\r\nand his father was rector of Bickleigh. A happy-go-lucky career was\r\nforeshadowed at the very outset, for his two 'illustrious godfathers,'\r\nMr Hugh Bampfylde and Major Moore, disputed as to whose name should\r\nstand first, and, as they could not agree, the matter was decided by\r\nspinning a coin. A few of the most interesting events in his career may\r\nbe quoted from a little biography first published anonymously in 1745,\r\nthirteen years before his death. Carew was sent to Blundell's, where for\r\na while he did well, although his tastes led him to be out with 'a cry'\r\nof hounds that the scholars of Blundell's kept among them, whenever it\r\nwas possible. On one occasion some farmers complained to the head-master\r\nof the damage that had been done in hunting a deer over standing corn,\r\nand the boy, to escape punishment, ran away from school and joined some\r\ngipsies. Carew took very kindly to the life, but repeated accounts of\r\nhis parents' unhappiness brought him home after a year and a half's\r\nwanderings. Though overwhelmed with 'marks of festive joy,' the call 'of\r\nthe wind on the heath,' was too strong to be resisted, and in a short\r\ntime he slipped away again and went back to his chosen people. He must\r\nhave been a very finished actor, with a genius for 'make-up,' to have\r\nimposed on half the people that he befooled. Amongst his first rôles\r\nwere those of a shipwrecked mariner; a poor Mad Tom, trying to eat live\r\ncoals; and a Kentish farmer, whose drowned farm in the Isle of Sheppey\r\ncould no longer support his wife and 'seven helpless infants.' Carew's\r\nrestless disposition took him to Newfoundland, and on his return he\r\nsuccessfully played the parts of a nonjuring clergyman, dispossessed of\r\nhis living for conscience' sake; a Quaker--here is a good example of his\r\nwonderful gift--in an assembly of Quakers; a ruined miller; a\r\nrat-catcher; and, having borrowed three children from a tinker, a\r\n_grandmother_. Carew once wheedled a gentleman, who boasted that he\r\ncould not be taken in by beggars, into giving him liberal alms twice in\r\none day--in the morning as an unfortunate blacksmith, whose all had been\r\ndestroyed by fire; whilst in the afternoon, on crutches, his face 'pale\r\nand sickly, his gestures very expressive of pain,' he pleaded as a\r\ndisabled tinner, who, from 'the damps and hardships he had suffered in\r\nthe mines,' could not work to keep his family.\r\n\r\nAt the death of Clause Patch, the King of the Gipsies, Carew was elected\r\nKing in his stead. Before he died, the aged King, feeling his end\r\napproaching, bestowed a few last words of advice on his followers, well\r\nworth quoting.\r\n\r\nOf begging in the street and interrupting people who are talking, he\r\nsaid: 'If they are tradesmen, their conversation will soon end, and may\r\nbe well paid for by a halfpenny; if an inferior clings to the skirt of a\r\nsuperior, he will give twopence rather than be pulled off; and when you\r\nare happy enough to meet a lover and his mistress, never part with them\r\nunder sixpence, for you may be sure they will never part from one\r\nanother.'\r\n\r\nThis is followed by shrewd advice as to the choice of an appeal:\r\n'Whatever people seem to want, give it them largely in your address to\r\nthem. Call the beau sweet Gentleman; bless even his coat or periwig; and\r\ntell him they are happy ladies where he's going. If you meet with a\r\nschoolboy captain, such as our streets are full of, call him noble\r\ngeneral; and if the miser can be in any way got to strip himself of a\r\nfarthing, it will be by the name of charitable Sir.... If you meet a\r\nsorrowful countenance with a red coat, be sure the wearer is a disbanded\r\nofficer. Let a female always attack him, and tell him she is the widow\r\nof a poor marine, who had served twelve years, and then broke his heart\r\nbecause he was turned out without a penny. If you meet a homely but\r\ndressed-up lady, pray for her lovely face, and beg a penny.'\r\n\r\nAfter his election as King of the Gipsies, or King of the Beggars, as he\r\nis more often called, Carew was soon involved in fresh adventures. But\r\none day grey ill-luck looked his way; he was arrested and sent for trial\r\nto Exeter. Courage and audacity never failed him, for when the Chairman\r\nof Quarter Sessions announced that the prisoner was to be transported to\r\na country which he pronounced _Merry_land, Carew calmly criticised his\r\npronunciation, and said he thought that _Mary_land would be more\r\ncorrect. To Maryland he was sent in charge of a brutal sea-captain, and\r\non his arrival, burdened with a heavy iron collar riveted round his\r\nneck, was set to all sorts of drudgery. Before very long he contrived to\r\nescape into the forests, and after some danger from wild beasts he\r\nreached a tribe of friendly Indians, who received him with great\r\nkindness. Later he stole a canoe, and, returning to civilized regions,\r\nposed as a kidnapped Quaker, in which character he succeeded in gaining\r\nthe compassion of Whitefield, the great preacher, who gave him 'three or\r\nfour pounds of that county paper money.' By the help of several\r\ningenious ruses he was able to get home again, and soon afterwards,\r\naided by a turban, a long, loose robe, and flowing beard, appeared as a\r\ndestitute Greek, whose 'mute silence, his dejected countenance, a sudden\r\ntear that now and then flowed down his cheek,' touched the hearts of the\r\nbenevolent. In an unlucky moment he was impressed for the navy; next\r\ntravelled in Russia, Poland, Sweden, and other countries, but, returning\r\nto England, was again seized, put in irons, and transported. With his\r\nusual indomitable spirit and resource, he escaped once more into the\r\nforests, and after dangers and hardships reached England. Finally, he\r\nended his days in peace where he began them, and was buried at Bickleigh\r\nin 1758.\r\n\r\nFive miles east of Tiverton is a village called Sampford Peverell, which\r\nin the early part of the nineteenth century suddenly sprang into notice\r\nthrough the strange proceedings of a mysterious spirit, known as the\r\nSampford Ghost. This 'goblin sprite,' as one account calls it, declared\r\nitself in a manner well known to psychical researchers, by violent\r\nknockings, and by causing a sword, a heavy book, and an iron candlestick\r\nto fly about the room. Two maid-servants received heavy blows while\r\nthey were in bed, and there were other strange and distressing\r\nphenomena. These manifestations were continued for more than three\r\nyears. Numberless visitors, drawn by curiosity from all parts of the\r\ncountry, came to investigate the matter, but no explanation could be\r\nfound, and though there were suspicions that the whole affair was a very\r\nelaborate hoax, and a reward of £250 was offered for information that\r\nmight throw light upon it, no single attempt was made to claim the\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nSampford Peverell is a small place, and rather out of the way, but so\r\nlong ago as in the reign of Edward I it is recorded that John de\r\nHillersdon held the manor on a tenure that reflects the unquiet state of\r\nthe country. He held it 'in fee, in serjeanty, by finding for our lord\r\nthe King, in his army in Wales, and elsewhere in England, whensoever war\r\nshould happen, one man with a horse caparisoned or armed for war at his\r\nproper costs for forty days to abide in the war aforesaid.' Hugh\r\nPeverell held the Manor of Sandford, near Crediton, on much the same\r\nterms, but had to provide 'one armed horseman and two footmen.'\r\n\r\nFollowing down Sampford stream for about three miles, one arrives at the\r\npoint where the stream reaches an opening into the Culm Valley, and\r\nempties itself in the Culm. A very short distance beyond is the little\r\ntown of Cullompton, of which the most interesting feature is a fine\r\nPerpendicular church. An old writer insists that here was formerly 'the\r\nfigure of Columbus, to which many pilgrims resorted, and which brought\r\nconsiderable sums to the priests'; but of this statement I can find\r\nneither confirmation nor denial. The tower of the church is high and\r\ndecorated. Within, the roof, richly carved and gilded, rests on a carved\r\nwall-plate, supported by angel corbels, and most exquisite is the\r\ncarving of the rood-screen, which has also been gilded and coloured. A\r\nvery rare possession of this church is 'a portion of a Calvary, and\r\nabove is an ornamental rood-beam, supported by angels; the Golgotha,\r\ncarved out of the butts of two trees, is now in the tower, and is hewn\r\nand carved to represent rocks bestrewn with skulls and bones; the\r\nmortice holes for the crucifix and attendant figures remain.' Early\r\nfifteenth-century figures painted on the wall were discovered when the\r\nchurch was 'restored' in 1849, but they were covered with whitewash!\r\n\r\nThe making of woollen goods throve in earlier times in Cullompton, and a\r\nrich clothier, John Lane by name, and his wife Thomasine, added a very\r\nbeautiful aisle to the church about 1526. The roof of the 'Lane' aisle\r\nis covered with exquisite fan-tracery, rich carvings, and figures of\r\nangels, and pendants droop from the centre. The pillars, the buttresses,\r\nand parts of the outside walls are decorated by carvings of Lane's\r\nmonogram, his merchant's mark, and different symbols of his trade.\r\n\r\nThree miles south-east of Cullompton is another church famed for its\r\nbeautiful screen. The Plymtree screen is probably unique in bearing on\r\nits panels the likenesses of Henry VII, his son Prince Arthur, and\r\nCardinal Morton. The upper part of the screen is a magnificent bit of\r\ncarving. Graceful pillars rise like stems, and their lines curve\r\noutwards into the lines of palm-leaves, overspreading one another, while\r\nthe arches they form are filled with most delicate tracery, supported on\r\nthe slenderest shafts. Above are four rows of carving, each of different\r\ndesign--one a vine, with clusters of grapes, and this is repeated more\r\nheavily on the capital of a pillar in the nave. The screen must have\r\nbeen glorious in gold and vermilion, and gold lines cross each other,\r\nmaking a sort of lattice-work, with ornaments at the points of\r\nintersection--a large double rose, a little shield with the Bouchier\r\nknot, or the Stafford knot, or a very naturally carved spray of\r\noak-leaves. Below, the panels are painted with saints and angels and\r\nbishops. The King, Prince, and Cardinal appear in a representation of\r\nthe Adoration of the Three Kings, each one bringing his offering in a\r\ndifferently-shaped vessel. Mr Mozley, a former Rector of Plymtree, has\r\nwritten a most interesting pamphlet on the subject, tracing out the\r\nlikeness of these portraits to other pictures or busts of the three. He\r\npoints out that, whereas in most paintings of the Three Kings each has a\r\ncrown, that of the foremost usually laid on the ground, in this group\r\nKing Henry alone is crowned; the Cardinal has none; and the Prince, who\r\nis represented as very young, is wearing a boy's cap. Mr Mozley has\r\nsearched carefully for a reason that would account for the group in this\r\nlittle church, and has found what seems to be a perfectly sufficient\r\nconnecting link. Lord Hastings, who married the heiress of Lord\r\nHungerford, and incidentally acquired the Manor of Plymtree, was the\r\nwarm friend and political ally of Cardinal Morton. The son and successor\r\nof Lord Hastings was a close personal friend of Henry VI, and in\r\nconsequence a colleague of the Cardinal, the King's chief counsellor.\r\nThere is no date on the screen, but from various deductions it is\r\nbelieved to have been painted about the end of the fifteenth century, or\r\na little later, and either during the lifetime or just after the death\r\nof the three subjects of the group, and of Lord Hastings.\r\n\r\nBradninch lies a short distance to the west of Plymtree, and this church\r\ncontains a very fine screen and an old and remarkable painting of the\r\nCrucifixion. It was originally placed in an aisle that was built in the\r\nreign of Henry VII by the Fraternity of St John, or the Guild of\r\nCordwainers.\r\n\r\nThe Culm runs past Bradninch, at a little distance to the east, and a\r\nfew miles farther on the river passes under the dark hills of Killerton\r\nPark, a heavily wooded and irregular ridge, rising at either extremity\r\nand ending in a decided slope down to the flat space just around. The\r\nhouse is not an old one, although the Aclands have been here since the\r\nreign of Queen Elizabeth, when Sir John Acland moved from the estate at\r\nLandkey, near Barnstaple, where they were already settled in the reign\r\nof Henry II. He built a house at Culm John (quite close to Killerton)\r\nthat was garrisoned for the King during the Civil War, and held out when\r\nalmost every other place in Devonshire had surrendered. But it has since\r\nbeen pulled down.\r\n\r\nThere are many stories of different members of this family, but perhaps\r\nthe most romance lies in that of Lady Harriot Acland, who, with serene\r\ncourage, followed her husband through the horrors and hardships of a\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nIn 1776 Major Acland was with the army that had been sent to crush the\r\nAmerican struggle for Independence, and his wife had accompanied him.\r\nThe following extract is taken from a statement by General Burgoyne, the\r\nGeneral commanding the troops in Canada: 'In the course of that\r\ncampaign, she had traversed a vast space of country in different\r\nextremities of seasons. She was restrained from offering herself to a\r\nshare of the hazard expected before Ticonderoga, by the positive\r\ninjunction of her husband. The day after the conquest of that place he\r\nwas badly wounded, and she crossed the Lake Champlain to join him.'\r\n\r\nWhen he was recovered, Lady Harriot continued to follow his fortunes\r\nthrough the campaign, and acquired a 'two-wheel tumbril, which had been\r\nconstructed by the artillery.' Colonel Acland was with the most advanced\r\ncorps of the army, and they were often in so much danger of being\r\nsurprised that they had to sleep in their clothes. Once the Aclands'\r\ntent and all that was in it was burned, but this accident 'neither\r\naltered the resolution nor the cheerfulness of Lady Harriot, and she\r\ncontinued her progress a partaker of the fatigues of the advanced corps.\r\nThe next call upon her fortitude was more distressful. On the march of\r\nthe 19th, the Grenadiers being liable to action at every step, she had\r\nbeen directed by Major Acland to follow the route of the artillery and\r\nluggage which was not exposed. At the time the action began she found\r\nherself near a small uninhabited hut, where she alighted. When it was\r\nfound the action was becoming general and bloody, the surgeons of the\r\nhospital took possession of the same place as the most convenient for\r\nthe first care of the wounded. Thus was this lady in hearing of one\r\ncontinued fire of cannon and musketry for some hours together, with the\r\npresumption, from the post of her husband at the head of the Grenadiers,\r\nthat he was in the most exposed part of the action. She had three female\r\ncompanions--the Baroness of Reidesel, and the wives of two British\r\nofficers, Major Harnage and Lieutenant Reynell; but in the event their\r\npresence served but little for comfort. Major Harnage was soon brought\r\nto the surgeons, very badly wounded; and a little while after came\r\nintelligence that Lieutenant Reynell was shot dead. Imagination will\r\nwant no help to figure the state of the whole group.' Not long\r\nafterwards Lady Harriot passed through an even severer ordeal. During\r\nanother engagement 'she was exposed to the hearing of the whole action,\r\nand at last received the shock of her individual misfortune mixed with\r\nthe intelligence of the general calamity; the troops were defeated, and\r\nMajor Ackland, desperately wounded, was a prisoner.\r\n\r\n'The day of the 8th was passed by Lady Harriot and her companions in\r\ncommon anxiety; not a tent, not a shed being standing except what\r\nbelonged to the hospital, their refuge was among the wounded and dying.\r\n\r\n'I soon received a message from Lady Harriot, submitting to my decision\r\na proposal (and expressing an earnest solicitude to execute it if not\r\ninterfering with my designs) of passing to the camp of the enemy and\r\nrequesting General Gates's permission to attend her husband.... I was\r\nastonished at this proposal. After so long an agitation of the spirits,\r\nexhausted not only for want of rest, but absolutely want of food,\r\ndrenched in rains for twelve hours together, that a woman should be\r\ncapable of such an undertaking as delivering herself to the enemy,\r\nprobably in the night, and uncertain of what hands she might fall into,\r\nappeared an effort above human nature. The assistance I was enabled to\r\ngive her was small indeed; I had not even a cup of wine to offer her;\r\nbut I was told she had found from some kind and fortunate hand a little\r\nrum and dirty water. All I could furnish to her was an open boat and a\r\nfew lines written upon dirty and wet paper, to General Gates,\r\nrecommending her to his protection.\r\n\r\n'Mr Brudenell, the chaplain to the Artillery, ...readily undertook to\r\naccompany her, and with one female servant, and the Major's\r\nvalet-de-chambre (who had a ball, which he had received in the late\r\naction, then in his shoulder), she rowed down the river to meet the\r\nenemy. But her distresses were not yet to end. The night advanced before\r\nthe boat reached the enemy's outposts, and the sentinel would not let it\r\npass, nor even come on shore. In vain Mr Brudenell offered the flag of\r\ntruce.... The guard threatened to fire into the boat if they stirred\r\nbefore daylight.' And for seven or eight dark and cold hours they were\r\nobliged to wait. Happily, when at length she did reach the shore, Lady\r\nHarriot was received with all courtesy by General Gates, and had the\r\njoy of nursing her husband back to health.\r\n\r\nA little to the south-west of Killerton Park lie the well-ordered park\r\nand beautiful grounds of Lord Poltimore. John Bampfylde, his ancestor,\r\nwas lord of this manor in the reign of Edward I, but the line of\r\nsuccession has been threatened by an episode, told by Prince (in his\r\n'Worthies of Devon'), that reads like a folk-story. At one time the head\r\nof the family was a child, who, left an orphan very young, was given as\r\na ward 'to some great person in the East Country.' This gentleman\r\ncarried the child away to his own home, and, although not going quite so\r\nfar as the wicked uncle in The Babes in the Wood, behaved very\r\ntreacherously to his ward; 'concealing from him his quality and\r\ncondition, and preventing what he could any discovery thereof, his\r\nguardian bred him up as his servant, and at last made him his huntsman.'\r\n\r\nTo any who concerned themselves about the boy, the false guardian 'some\r\nyears after gave it out, he was gone to travel (or the like pretence),\r\nin-so-much his relations and friends, believing it to be true, looked no\r\nfurther after him.' But Bampfylde's tenants were more faithful, and one\r\nof them, on his own responsibility, rose to the tremendous effort and\r\nenterprise of starting off in search of him. His loyalty was rewarded\r\nwith full success, for he was able to find and identify the young man,\r\nand, biding his time, the tenant grasped an opportunity of talking\r\nquietly to him, and 'acquainted him with his birth and fortunes, and\r\nfinally arranged his escape.' And in this way the true heir came to his\r\nown again.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1646 Poltimore House was chosen by Fairfax as the\r\nmeeting-place of his commissioners and those sent by Sir John Berkeley,\r\nand here they discussed the articles of the surrender of besieged\r\nExeter, and drew up the treaty that could be accepted by both sides.\r\n\r\nSir Coplestone Bampfylde, having 'a vigorous soul,' worked for the\r\nRestoration with so much zeal that messengers were sent from the\r\nParliament to arrest him, and he was forced to hide.\r\n\r\nBut 'his generous mind could not be affrighted from following his duty\r\nand honour,' and as the citizens of Exeter, by this time very\r\ndissatisfied with the Government, were beginning to arm, declaring for a\r\nfree Parliament, Sir Coplestone and other gentlemen composed an address,\r\ndemanding the recall of the members secluded in 1648, and 'all to be\r\nadmitted without any oath or engagement previous to their entrance.' He\r\nnext took his way to London, to present 'an humble petition of right' on\r\nbehalf of the county to General Monk, but was seized by the Parliament\r\nand flung into the Tower. His imprisonment was brief, and Charles II\r\nrewarded Bampfylde's energy by choosing him to be the first High Sheriff\r\nof the county of his reign, and later appointing him to other posts of\r\n'trust and honour.'\r\n\r\nJohn Bampfylde, a descendant of Sir Coplestone's, was a poet, and among\r\nhis verses occurs this charming sonnet, on that not unknown event in\r\nDevon--a Wet Summer:\r\n\r\n    'All ye who far from town in rural hall,\r\n    Like me, were wont to dwell near pleasant field,\r\n    Enjoying all the sunny day did yield--\r\n    With me the change lament, in irksome thrall,\r\n    By rains incessant held; for now no call\r\n    From early swain invites my hand to wield\r\n    The scythe. In parlour dim I sit concealed,\r\n    And mark the lessening sand from hour-glass fall;\r\n    Or 'neath my window view the wistful train\r\n    Of dripping poultry, whom the vine's broad leaves\r\n    Shelter no more. Mute is the mournful plain.\r\n    Silent the swallow sits beneath the thatch,\r\n    And vacant hind hangs pensive o'er his hatch,\r\n    Counting the frequent drip from reeded eaves.'\r\n\r\nPoltimore is nearly two miles east of the Exe, and if a straight line\r\nacross country were followed to the river, the traveller would arrive\r\nalmost at the point where the Culm flows into the larger stream. The\r\nvalley here is rather broad, and the river winds between pleasant, rich,\r\ngreen meadows and wooded hills, most of which rise in gentle, easy\r\nslopes. Not quite two miles north of Exeter, the Exe turns due south,\r\nand is joined by the Creedy, running south-west. Westcote, in flowery\r\nlanguage, describes the scene, painting a picture which would stand good\r\nto-day, but that nearly all the mills are gone. Cowley Bridge, 'built\r\nof fair square stone,' stands just above the junction, 'where Exe\r\nmusters gloriously, being bordered on each side with profitable mills,\r\nfat green marshes and meadows (enamelled with a variety of golden\r\nspangles of fragrant flowers, and bordered with silver swans), makes a\r\ndeep show, as if she would carry boats and barges home to the city; but\r\nwe are opposed by Exwick wear, and indeed wears have much impaired his\r\nlustre and portable ability, which else might have brought his\r\ndenominated city rich merchandise home to the very gates.'\r\n\r\nHere one may leave the Exe to follow the Creedy upstream for five miles\r\nor so, till Crediton is reached. 'Creedy' comes from the Celtic word\r\n_Crwydr_, a hook or crook, a name that its tortuous way must have\r\nearned. The river runs between crumbling banks of soft earth, and shifts\r\nits course a little after any great flood. It is curious to notice the\r\ndifference after heavy rains between the Exe and the Creedy, for while\r\nthe former will be still a comparatively clear brown, even when it comes\r\ndown a great swirling flood, thundering over the weirs and hurrying\r\nalong honeycombs of foam, the Creedy will have turned to a surging,\r\nturbid volume of water, of a deep red, terra-cotta colour, that leaves\r\ntraces of red mud in the overhanging trees when the river has subsided.\r\n\r\nThe valley is a narrow one, and on the hill-sides are copses and\r\norchards, lovely as a sea of pink and white blossoms, and very admirable\r\non a bright day in September, when the bright crimson cider apples, and\r\ngolden ones with rosy cheeks, are showing among the leaves, and the hot\r\nsunshine, following a touch of frost, brings out the clean, crisp, sweet\r\nscent of ripe apples till it floats across roads and hedges. Leland\r\nremarks that 'the ground betwixt _Excestre_ and _Crideton_ exceeding\r\nfair Corn Greese and Wood. There is a praty market in Kirton.' Kirton\r\nwas the popular name for the town. Its origin is far to seek, for the\r\nsaying runs:\r\n\r\n    'Crediton was a market town,\r\n    When Exeter was a vuzzy[1] down.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Vuzz, _i.e._ furze.]\r\n\r\nHowever this may have been, it is, at any rate, certain that the Bishops\r\nof Devon were seated at Crediton for over one hundred and forty years\r\nbefore, in 1050, Leofric removed to Exeter. And nearly two and a half\r\ncenturies before the first Bishop settled at Crediton, religious feeling\r\nwas awake, as is shown by the story of St Boniface, or, as he was\r\noriginally called, Wynfrith. This saint, the great missionary to the\r\nGermans, is believed to have been born here in the year 680, and at a\r\nvery early age he wished to become a monk. His desire was not at once\r\ngranted, for his father could not bear to part with him, and much\r\nopposition had to be overcome before he was allowed to go to school in\r\nExeter. After he was ordained, Boniface won the respect and confidence\r\nof Ina, King of the West Saxons, but feeling that his work lay in\r\nanother country, he went to Thuringia, to throw his strength into the\r\nconversion of the heathen. Combining 'learning, excellency of memory,\r\nintegrity of life, and vivacity of spirit, he was fit for great\r\nemployment,' says an old writer, and he was chosen Archbishop of Mentz,\r\nbecoming the chief authority on all spiritual matters in Germany. In\r\nspite of the heavy cares and toils entailed by his high office, St\r\nBoniface still laboured personally among the recalcitrant heathen, and\r\nin his seventy-sixth year\r\n\r\n    'Had his death by faithless Frisians slain.'\r\n\r\nEight Bishops lived and died at Crediton, and the ninth demanded that\r\nthe see should be transferred from Crediton to Exeter. The chief reason\r\nput forward was that Exeter was a strong city, and less likely to be\r\nravaged by Irish Danes and other 'barbarian pirates,' but Professor\r\nFreeman suggests that Leofric also desired the change because he had\r\nbeen educated on the Continent, where it was never the custom for a\r\nBishop's chief seat to be in a village when a larger town was in his\r\ndiocese. Anyhow, Leofric obtained his wish, and was led to his throne in\r\nSt Peter's Church in Exeter by the King on one hand and the Queen on the\r\nother, in the presence of two Archbishops and other nobles.\r\n\r\nThe palace and park at Crediton remained in the possession of the\r\nBishops till the Dissolution.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Church of St Cross stands either upon or close to the site\r\nof the original cathedral of the Bishops, which, on the removal of the\r\nSee to Exeter, was made a collegiate church, with precentor, treasurer,\r\ndean, eighteen canons and as many vicars, besides singing-men or\r\nlay-vicars.\r\n\r\nThe present church is mainly Perpendicular, though the Lady Chapel is\r\nearly Decorated, and there are portions of still earlier work. The tower\r\nis central, square, and rather low. It is surmounted by four embattled\r\nturrets, and battlements run round the roof of the church. The whole\r\nbuilding is of a soft rose-red colour, but the walls within were once\r\nwhitewashed, and are now of a slightly cooler tint. The clustered\r\npillars look as if, over a warm, soft grey, a faint, transparent tinge\r\nof rose-colour had passed, leaving a very lovely effect; they are tall\r\nand graceful, and delicate carving adorns the capitals. The nave is\r\nlofty and unusually long. On the south side of the chancel are sedilia,\r\nonce elaborately decorated and glorious in vermilion and gold; a design\r\nresembling a very large but intricate network in gold spreads over the\r\nbacks of the sedilia, and a little figure, with faint traces of colour\r\nand gilding, stands at one end. On the north side of the chancel is the\r\neffigy, lying at full length, of William Peryam; and close by is a\r\nmonument to John Tuckfield, engraved with an epitaph full of praise, in\r\nwhich occur these lines, in peculiar lettering and spelling:\r\n\r\n    'Why do I live, in Life and Thrall,\r\n    Of Joy and all Bereaft,\r\n    Yor Winges were grown, To Heaven are flown,\r\n    'Cause I had none am Leaft.'\r\n\r\nThe Lady Chapel is beautifully decorated. At the south end of the choir\r\nis a large tomb, on which lie, side by side, the effigies of a knight in\r\narmour and a lady with a wonderful head-dress, large and square. The\r\nfigures are somewhat mutilated, but the little angels that supported her\r\nhead can just be distinguished. The tomb is supposed to be that of Sir\r\nJohn Sully and his wife; he, having fought at Crecy and Poictiers, lived\r\nto give evidence, at the age of 105, in the great Scrope and Grosvenor\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\nIn the south porch is a bit of early English work, a piscina and\r\nholy-water stoup side by side, under one arch, with a very slender\r\ndetached shaft between. The upper portion of the font is late Norman,\r\nand is dark, shallow, and square. Behind the font a small door and tiny\r\nstaircase lead up to the parvise, where is stored a library that was\r\ngiven for the priest's use. The books include a 'Vinegar' Bible, an\r\n_Eikon Basilike_, and other treasures.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious account of a miracle that took place in this church\r\non August 1, 1315, while Bishop Stapeldon was celebrating Mass. Thomas\r\nOrey, a fuller by trade, of Keynsham, became suddenly blind one day in\r\nEaster week for no apparent reason. A vivid dream that, if he should\r\nvisit the Church of Holy Cross at Crediton, his sight would return,\r\ninduced him to journey there with his wife, and several witnesses,\r\nafterwards called by the Bishop to give evidence, solemnly asserted that\r\nwhen he arrived in the town he was totally blind. Two days he spent in\r\nthe church, and on the third, he being 'instant at prayer before the\r\naltar of St Nicholas, suddenly recovered his sight.'\r\n\r\nCrediton had for a long time a very important trade in woollen goods,\r\nwhich were made here as early as in the thirteenth century. In the reign\r\nof Queen Elizabeth it was one of the principal centres of the\r\nmanufacture in the county, and, indeed, caused Exeter so much jealousy\r\nthat weavers, tuckers, and others, petitioned the authorities until it\r\nwas ordained that the serge-market should be removed from here, and a\r\nweekly one set up in Exeter, to the great and natural indignation of\r\nCrediton. 'Their market for kersies hath been very great, especially of\r\nthe finer sort,' says Westcote, 'for the aptness and diligent industry\r\nof the inhabitants ... did purchase it a supereminent name above all\r\nother towns, whereby grew this common proverb--as fine as Kirton\r\nspinning ... which spinning was very fine indeed, which to express, the\r\nbetter to gain your belief, it is very true that 140 threads of woollen\r\nyarn spun in that town were drawn together through the eye of a tailor's\r\nneedle; which needle and threads were, for many years together, to be\r\nseen in Watling-street, in London, in the shop of one Mr Dunscombe.'\r\n\r\nCrediton was once, for a brief but fateful moment, the focus of a very\r\nserious movement. During 1549 discontent showed itself in many parts of\r\nEngland, and very gravely in the West, where a rising of Devonshire and\r\nCornish men brought about the 'Affair of the Crediton Barns,' and\r\nculminated in the siege of Exeter. The first definite outbreak was at\r\nSampford Courtenay, on Whit Monday, June 10. On Sunday the Book of\r\nCommon Prayer was used for the first time, but the people were\r\ndissatisfied. They did not care to hear the service in their own tongue\r\ninstead of in Latin, and they resented all the other changes. And when\r\non Monday the priest was 'preparing himself to say the service as he had\r\ndone the day before ... they said he should not do so.... In the end,\r\nwhether it were with his will or against his will, he ravisheth himself\r\nin his old Popish attire, and sayeth Mass, and all such services as in\r\nTimes past accustomed.'\r\n\r\nThe news of this incident spread; other villages followed suit, and the\r\nlocal magistrates unwillingly recognized that the ferment of rebellion\r\nwas working, and met together to try and reason the people into a more\r\nsubmissive frame of mind. But the movement was too full of force to be\r\narrested by such gentle methods, and the justices, 'being afraid of\r\ntheir own shadows, ... departed without having done anything at all.'\r\nUnfortunately, their reasoning had merely an irritating effect, so that,\r\nwhen a certain gentleman named Helions tried mildly to enforce some of\r\nthe remonstrances, a man struck him on the neck with a billhook and\r\nkilled him. This blow seems to have stirred the mob into taking a\r\ndefinite course of action, and they marched on Crediton. News of the\r\ndisturbance had, meanwhile, reached the King, and Sir Peter and Sir\r\nGawen Carew were sent down in haste to deal with the matter. From\r\nExeter, they and several other gentlemen rode to confer with the people;\r\nbut the people, having had notice of the arrival of the knights, 'they\r\nintrench the highways, and make a mighty rampire at the Town's End, and\r\nfortify the same' and 'also the Barns of both sides of the way.' The\r\nwalls were pierced with 'loops and holes for their shot,' and 'so\r\ncomplenished with men, well appointed with bows and arrows and other\r\nweapons, that there was no passage nor entry for them into the town.'\r\nNor would they listen to 'the Gentlemen,' but refused all conference.\r\n\r\nThe 'Warlike Knights' then tried force, but were driven back with loss,\r\nby a heavy volley. 'Whereupon some one strong man of that company,' says\r\nHooker (who must have admired decision), 'unawares of the gentlemen, did\r\nset one of the barns on fire, and then the Commoners, seeing that, ran\r\nand fled away out of the town.' This ended all the trouble in Crediton,\r\nthough the smoking barns served as fuel to the growing spirit of revolt,\r\nand the 'Barns of Crediton' became a party-cry.\r\n\r\nClarendon mentions briefly that Charles I came here on his way into\r\nCornwall, and reviewed the troops under Prince Maurice.\r\n\r\nAbout one hundred and fifty years later the distant echoes of war\r\nsounded faintly in Crediton, for French prisoners of war on parole,\r\nNapoleon's soldiers, were allowed to live in this town. Vague rumours of\r\nthem may still be heard. The sexton remembers that his mother often told\r\nabout them, and one of the first people he buried was a man named Henry,\r\n'though,' he explained, 'they spell it rather differently.' The\r\nmelancholy fate of this stranger throws a light on one of the\r\ndisregarded tragedies in the train of war, for Henri was not a soldier,\r\nbut the son of a French prisoner. For some reason he never went home,\r\nand died in the workhouse.\r\n\r\nAmongst the conditions that the prisoners on parole had to sign was:\r\n'Not to withdraw one mile from the boundaries prescribed there without\r\nleave for that purpose from the said Commissioners;' and on some roads a\r\nstone was put up marking the limits. One of these stones, of grey\r\nlimestone, and very like a milestone with no inscription, is still to be\r\nseen jutting out from the bank of Shobrooke Park, on the Stockleigh\r\nPomeroy road. Another witness to the presence of the French prisoners\r\nlies in the name that clings to a bit of road running behind the\r\nVicarage, for it is still sometimes called the Belle Parade, and\r\ntradition says that here they used to assemble on Sundays.\r\n\r\nReturning along the river, one passes through the property of the late\r\nSir Redvers Buller. Downes is a white house standing amongst green open\r\nlawns sloping to the river, and it has a background of great trees and\r\nample shrubberies. The Bullers at one time lived chiefly in Cornwall,\r\nand Downes was originally a shooting-box. A hay-loft stood at one end,\r\nand when the house was enlarged the archway under which the hay-waggons\r\nwere driven was left standing, and now forms part of the drawing-room--a\r\nroom with an unusually high ceiling. A member of the family has been\r\nkind enough to send me notes of one or two incidents in the history of\r\nthe Bullers.\r\n\r\n'The whole Buller family was at one time reduced to a single individual,\r\nJohn Francis Buller. He died of the smallpox. His mother insisted on\r\nseeing him after death. It was in the days when air was considered\r\nhighly prejudicial to smallpox patients, who were covered with red\r\ncloth, and every window and cranny through which air might enter was\r\ncarefully closed. To minimize the risk to his mother, who would listen\r\nto no dissuasion, all the windows and doors were opened, and a draught\r\nof air admitted, with the result that when his mother entered the room\r\nthe dead man rose from his bed and received her.' Mr Buller lived to\r\nmarry Rebecca, daughter of the Bishop Trelawney who was one of the seven\r\nBishops sent to the Tower by James II. His arrest created intense\r\nindignation in his own county; and he is the Trelawney referred to in\r\nthe well-known fragment, all that remains of a ballad written at the\r\ntime to express Cornish feeling:\r\n\r\n    'And shall they scorn Tre, Pol, and Pen?\r\n      And shall Trelawney die?\r\n    There's twenty thousand Cornishmen[2]\r\n      Will know the reason why.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In another version 'underground'--_i.e._, miners.]\r\n\r\nA later Mr Buller of Downes had a brief but unpleasant experience of the\r\nfeeling of the mob in regard to the Reform Bill.\r\n\r\n'I recollect hearing that at the time of the first Reform Bill (1830)\r\nthe members of the House of Commons were threatened with dire\r\nconsequences if they could not give what the mob considered satisfactory\r\nanswers to their questions.\r\n\r\n'Mr Buller of Downes was on his way to the House in his own carriage,\r\nwhen a crowd stopped him, demanding to know how he meant to vote. He\r\ntook no notice of their request, but remained quietly seated, when some\r\nof the men opened the carriage door with cries of, \"Pull him out! Pull\r\nhim out!\" and were proceeding to carry out their threat, when his\r\nservant, who was standing behind the carriage, sprang up to the roof,\r\nand, waving his hat, shouted: \"What! don't you know my master, Squire\r\nBuller? Why, he's always for the people!\" Whereupon the door was closed\r\nagain with a bang, the coachman told to drive on, and \"Squire Buller\"\r\nreached the House without further molestation.'\r\n\r\nTwo miles farther on the river passes the village of Newton St Cyres, or\r\nSyriak Newton, as some of the older writers called it. The church has\r\nseveral interesting features, and escaped the ruthless 'restoration'\r\nthat so many village churches suffered from at the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century. Alders and willows overhang the stream, which winds\r\nits way to the south-west, and about two miles farther on one arrives\r\nagain at Cowley Bridge. The Valley of the Exe gets ever wider and\r\nflatter, and after Exeter has been passed the flatness on either side of\r\nthe banks increases as the river draws near the estuary.\r\n\r\nTopsham stands at the head of the estuary, and is a pleasant little\r\ntown, whose great days are gone by. It is difficult to believe that in\r\nthe reign of William III Topsham had more trade with Newfoundland than\r\nany other port in the country excepting London. Presumably it was at\r\nthis time that certain Dutch merchants came to live here, and built\r\nthemselves quaint narrow houses of small Dutch bricks, painted the\r\ncolour of bath-bricks. Rounded gable-ends are a feature of these houses,\r\nwhich may still be seen along the Strand. In many cases the clerk's\r\nhouse, a smaller, humbler dwelling of exactly the same design, stands\r\nclose to the merchant's, separated by their respective gardens.\r\n\r\nTill wooden ships were superseded, frigates for the navy were built\r\nhere, but now, although some of the largest ships stop and unload their\r\ncargoes for Exeter, there is little of the stir and bustle that the town\r\nmust once have rejoiced in.\r\n\r\nMiss Celia Fiennes, who rode through England about 1695, mentions\r\nTopsham in her diary as 'a little market place and a very good Key;\r\nhither they convey on horses their serges and soe load their shipps w^h\r\ncomes to this place, all for London.' She also speaks of Starcross, on\r\nthe farther side of the river, 'where the Great shipps ride, and there\r\nthey build some shipps.'\r\n\r\nIn the end of the seventeenth century there sprang from Topsham a man of\r\ngreat resoluteness, pluck, and the spirit to fight against tremendous\r\nodds in cold blood. Robert Lyde, mate of the _Friend's Adventure_,\r\nhimself wrote an account of his fortunes on board that vessel. Lyde's\r\ngreat bitterness against the French is explained by the fact that he had\r\nalready suffered intensely at their hands. Two years before he had been\r\ncaptured at sea by a French privateer, and imprisoned at St Malo, 'where\r\nwe were used with such inhumanity and cruelty that if we had been taken\r\nby the Turks we could not have been used worse.' The prisoners were\r\nalmost starved, and their condition was wretched in every respect.\r\n'These and their other barbarities made so great an impression on me\r\nthat I did resolve never to go a prisoner there again, and this\r\nresolution I did ever since continue in.' But when he was for the second\r\ntime made prisoner--this time on board the _Friend's Adventure_--there\r\nseemed no escape from this evil fate. The crew were all removed from the\r\nship, excepting Lyde and one boy, who, under a prize-master and six men,\r\nwere to help in sailing her to St Malo. The idea of returning to the\r\nidentical prison where he had endured such misery made Lyde desperate,\r\nand, finding no easier expedient, he determined to pit himself against\r\nthe seven as soon as he could persuade the boy to join him. The boy, not\r\nunnaturally, hung back from such a venture, and before he could screw\r\nhis courage to the sticking-place they had arrived off a small harbour\r\nnear Brest, and the French had fired a 'patteroe' for a pilot.\r\n'Whereupon, considering the inhuman usage I formerly had in France, and\r\nhow near I was to it again, struck me with such terror that I went down\r\nbetween decks and prayed God for a southerly wind, to prevent her from\r\ngoing into that harbour, which God was most graciously pleased to grant\r\nme, for which I returned my unfeigned thanks.'\r\n\r\nLyde's anxiety to attack the French was now redoubled, and when they\r\ninvited him to their breakfast, he was so 'ready to faint with eagerness\r\nto encounter them' that he could not stay in the same cabin. He went up\r\n'betwixt decks' to the boy, 'and did earnestly entreat him to go up\r\npresently to the cabin and stand behind me, and knock down but one man,\r\nin case two laid on me, and I would kill and command all the rest\r\npresently.' The boy, however, was timid, and when Lyde, to spur him into\r\nresistance, told all the horrible details of his former captivity, he\r\ncalmly replied: 'If I do find it as hard as you say when I am in France,\r\nI will go along with them in a privateer.' 'These words,' writes Lyde,\r\n'struck me to the heart, which made me say: \"You dog! What! will you go\r\nwith them against your King and Country, and Father and Mother? Sirrah!\r\nI was a prisoner in France four months, and my tongue cannot express\r\nwhat I endured there, yet I would not turn Papist and go with them. If I\r\nshould take my brother in a French privateer, after he had sailed\r\nwillingly with them, I would hang him immediately.\"' Perhaps at this\r\npoint the boy began to fear opposing Lyde as much as attacking all the\r\nFrenchmen, for he now consented to help, and was told that if he would\r\nknock down the man at the helm, all the others should be Lyde's affair.\r\nThe _sang-froid_ of the ensuing conversation is remarkable. 'Saith the\r\nboy, \"If you be sure to overcome them, how many do you count to kill?\" I\r\nanswered that I intended to kill three of them. Then the boy replied,\r\n\"Why three, and no more?\" I answered that I would kill three for three\r\nof our men that died in Prison when I was there.' Lyde went on to\r\nexpress a hope that some day a 'Man-of-War or Fireship' will try to\r\navenge 'the Death of those four hundred men that died in the same Prison\r\nof Dinan.' But the boy's fears found the present scheme too merciful,\r\nand he protested, 'Four alive would be too many for us.'\r\n\r\nThe attack was made when two Frenchmen were asleep in the cabin. 'I went\r\nsoftly aft into the cabin, and put my back against the bulkhead, and\r\ntook the iron crow and held it with both my hands in the middle of it,\r\nand put my legs to shorten myself, because the cabin was very low. But\r\nhe that being nighest to me, hearing me, opened his eyes, and\r\nperceiving my intent and upon what account I was coming, he endeavoured\r\nto rise to make resistance against me, but I prevented him by a blow\r\nupon his forehead which mortally wounded him.' The other man received a\r\nheavy blow as he was rising, 'very fiercely endeavouring to come against\r\nme.... The master, lying in his cabin on my right hand, rose and sat in\r\nhis cabin, and seeing what I had done, he called me by most insulting\r\nnames.' But 'having his eyes every way,' Lyde turned on him with a blow\r\nwhich made him 'lie as still as if he had been dead.'\r\n\r\nHe then went to 'attack the two men who were at the pump, where they\r\ncontinued pumping without hearing or knowing what I had done;' but one\r\nof the wounded men crawled out of the cabin, and when the men at the\r\npump 'saw his blood running out of the hole in his forehead, they came\r\nrunning aft to me, grinding their teeth as if they would have eaten me;\r\nbut I met them as they came within the steeridge door, and struck at\r\nthem; but the steeridge not being above four foot high, I could not have\r\na full blow at them, whereupon they fended off the blows, took hold of\r\nthe crow with both their hands close to mine, striving to haul it from\r\nme; then the boy might have knocked them down with much ease, but that\r\nhis heart failed him.' The master was by this time so far recovered that\r\nhe was able to join the other two, so that Lyde fought for his life\r\nagainst the three. The boy at one moment, thinking him overborne, 'cried\r\nout for fear. Then I said, \"Do you cry, you villain, now I am in such a\r\ncondition? Come quickly and knock this man on the head that hath hold of\r\nmy left arm.\" The boy took some courage, but struck so faintly that he\r\nmissed his blow, which greatly enraged me; and I, feeling the Frenchman\r\nabout my middle hang very heavy, said to the boy, \"Go round the binikle\r\nand knock down that man that hangeth on my back\"; so the boy did strike\r\nhim one blow on the head, and he went out on deck staggering to and\r\nfro.' After a further tremendous effort, Lyde killed one of the three\r\nstruggling with him, and the two others then begged for quarter; and at\r\nlast he set sail for Topsham, with five living prisoners under hatches.\r\nBut his troubles were not yet all passed. Exhausted as he was, he dared\r\nnot rest, and suffered from want of sleep, bad weather, and, when he\r\nreached home, a cold welcome. Arrived at Topsham Bar, he had no English\r\ncolours to run up, and the pilot he signalled feared to come out. Lyde\r\ndid not dare to bring in the ship by himself at night, and was blown off\r\nthe coast, so that he had the further labour of getting close to the bar\r\na second time. In the end he did succeed in getting safely home.\r\n\r\nJust beyond Topsham the little river Clyst joins the Exe. It has given\r\nnames to a surprising number of villages and manors, considering the\r\nshortness of its course--Clyst St Mary, Clyst St Laurence, Honiton\r\nClyst, and so on. At Clyst St George a small estate used to be held on\r\nthe curious tenure of 'the annual tender of an ivory bow.' About two\r\nmiles east of the river the land begins to slope upwards to the moorland\r\nof Woodbury Common, and on one part of the heath are the remains of an\r\nancient entrenchment called Woodbury Castle. 'No castle at all, built\r\nwith little cost,' says Westcote, 'without either lime or hewn stone:\r\nonly a hasty fortification made of mother-earth for the present to serve\r\na turn for need, with plain ditches, the Saxons' usual structure, who\r\ncommonly lay _sub dio_, with no other shelter or coverture than the\r\nstarry canopy.'\r\n\r\nWoodbury and Lympstone--a village on the edge of the estuary--were once\r\nowned by the family of De Albemarle, which name was gradually\r\ntransformed into Damarel, and in this guise is not uncommon in the West\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nTwo and a half miles farther on is Exmouth--a town fortunate in the\r\ndelightful views on every side. The sea stretches away to the south; on\r\nthe north-east the hills rise towards Woodbury Common; on the west lie\r\nthe broad, shining reaches of the river, and beyond them the beautiful\r\nheights of Haldon. Here 'Ex taketh his last tribute with a wider channel\r\nand curled waves, shedding itself into the sea.'\r\n\r\nExmouth has a rather curious history. In the early part of the\r\neighteenth century it was little more than a hamlet, chiefly consisting\r\nof fishermen's cottages; but soon afterwards it became a fashionable\r\nwatering-place--according to report, because one of the judges on\r\ncircuit was charmed with the sea-bathing here. The town continues to\r\nflourish and is greatly patronized by visitors. The strangeness of the\r\nhistory lies in the fact that Exmouth should ever have been reduced to\r\nsuch a humble condition, for it inherited great traditions. When the\r\nDanes descended on it in 1001, they found there a town and a castle, and\r\nbeing 'valiantly repelled by the guardians' of the latter, they revenged\r\nthemselves by burning the town.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of King John, Exmouth was a port of some consequence, and\r\nwhen Edward III was at war with France it was able to contribute no\r\nfewer than ten ships for an attack on Calais. Risdon says there was\r\n'sometime a castle, but now the place hath no defence than a barred\r\nhaven and the inhabitants' valour.' It is a little puzzling that both he\r\nand Westcote, writing about the beginning of the seventeenth century,\r\nshould imply that the old fortress had no successor, for a very few\r\nyears later Exmouth was garrisoned for the King. Either a fort must have\r\nbeen erected in the short interval, or some building turned into a\r\ntolerable substitute, for in the spring of 1646 'Fort Exmouth' was\r\nblockaded by Colonel Shapcote, and defended with great courage by\r\nColonel Arundell. It capitulated less than a month before the surrender\r\nof Exeter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nThe Otter and the Axe\r\n\r\n    'Dear native brook! Wild streamlet of the West!\r\n    How many various fated years have past,\r\n    What happy and what mournful hours, since last\r\n    I skimmed the smooth thin stone along thy breast,\r\n    Numbering its light leaps! yet so deep imprest\r\n    Sink the sweet scenes of childhood, that mine eyes\r\n    I never shut amid the sunny ray,\r\n    But straight with all their tints thy waters rise,\r\n    Thy crossing plank, thy marge with willows grey,\r\n    And bedded sand, that, veined with various dyes,\r\n    Gleamed through thy bright transparence! On my way,\r\n    Visions of childhood! oft have ye beguiled\r\n    Lone manhood's cares, yet waking fondest sighs:\r\n    Ah! that once more I were a careless child!'\r\n\r\n    COLERIDGE: _Sonnet to the River Otter_.\r\n\r\nThe River Otter rises in Somerset, and runs nearly due south, bearing\r\nslightly westwards till it reaches Honiton. Here it makes a curve still\r\nfarther to the west, and from Ottery St Mary runs southwards to the sea.\r\nIn Westcote's day, when the derivations of names were taken in a\r\nlight-hearted spirit, it was said: 'The river Otter, or river of otters\r\n(water-dogs), taking name from the abundance of these animals (which we\r\nterm otters) sometime haunting and using it.' But the more serious\r\nauthorities of to-day do not allow that the otters in this river have\r\nanything to do with the matter, and say that the name comes from the\r\nWelsh _y dwr_, the water. It is a rapid and very clear stream, flowing\r\nthrough green and fertile valleys.\r\n\r\nHoniton filled Defoe with admiration when he came to it on his journey\r\nto the West. He describes it as 'a pleasant, good town, that stands in\r\nthe best and pleasantest part of the whole country ... and to the\r\nentrance into Honiton the view of the country is the most beautiful\r\nlandscape in the world, a mere picture, and I do not remember the like\r\nin any one place in England.' Beyond this pleasantness there is nothing\r\nvery remarkable in the town; perhaps its most uncommon feature being a\r\nstream of clear water that runs down the street, with square\r\ndipping-places at intervals.\r\n\r\nTo the west the town looks over a space of comparatively flat country,\r\nbut on the north-west it is overshadowed by St. Cyres Hill, and farther\r\nnorth is the bold height of Dumpdon. On the top of this hill are the\r\nremains of an oval camp, and a few miles away to the north-west is the\r\nbetter-known camp called Hembury Fort. The fort stands very high, and\r\nlooks south to the sea beyond the Vale of the Otter, and west to Haldon\r\nand the fringes of Dartmoor over Exeter. Three ramparts surround the\r\nfort, which covers a large space of ground, and it is 'divided into two\r\nparts by a double agger.... Several Roman coins, and an iron \"lar\"\r\nrepresenting a female figure three inches high, have been found here.'\r\n\r\nA great Roman road passes by Honiton. The Fosseway ran from Caithness to\r\nTotnes (according to some authorities, on into Cornwall), and crossed\r\nthe country between Exeter or Seaton and Lincolnshire. It is thought\r\nthat the Romans, in making their famous roads, usually followed the line\r\nof still older British ways.\r\n\r\nIn coaching days Honiton was well known as a stage for changing horses.\r\nGay, who was a Devonshire man, a native of Barnstaple, says in his\r\n_Journey to Exeter, 1716, from London_:\r\n\r\n    'Now from the steep, 'midst scatter'd farms and groves,\r\n    Our eye through Honiton's fair valley roves;\r\n    Behind us soon the busy town we leave,\r\n    Where finest lace industrious lasses weave.'\r\n\r\nHere the poet mentions the one characteristic of the town known to\r\nstrangers--the lace-making. When or how it was first started is not\r\nexactly known, but there is a theory that certain Flemings, escaping to\r\nEngland from the persecutions of the Duke of Alva, settled near Honiton\r\nand introduced the art towards the end of the sixteenth century. The\r\nevidence is too slender to prove that this was so, but there is no doubt\r\nthat by the beginning of the next century the industry was well\r\nestablished, for in the Church of St Michael is a memorial brass plate\r\nrecording that\r\n\r\n                     JAMES RODGE of Honiton\r\n         in ye County of Devonshire (Bonelace Siller)\r\n         Hath given unto the Poore of Honinton P'ishe\r\n                 The Benefytt of £100 for ever.\r\n    Who deceased ye 27 of July A'o. Di. 1617. Ætate suæ 50.\r\n                       Remember ye poore.\r\n\r\nSo it is obvious that before 1617 there must have been enough lace to\r\ndispose of to make the sale of it profitable.\r\n\r\nAbout forty years later Fuller wrote a spirited defence of lace-making\r\non economic grounds. It was then 'made in and about Honyton, and weekly\r\nreturned to London.' He says: 'Though private persons pay for it, it\r\nstands the state in nothing.... Many lame in their limbs and impotent in\r\ntheir arms, if able in their fingers, gain a livelyhood thereby, not to\r\nsay that it saveth some thousand of pounds yearly, formerly sent over\r\nseas to fetch Lace from Flanders.' At this time the lace trade\r\nflourished greatly, although there was always a difficulty in competing\r\nwith Belgium, because of the superiority of its silky flax, finer than\r\nany spun in England. Later the workers fell on evil days, for during the\r\nAmerican War there was little money to spend on luxuries; and, besides,\r\nabout this time the fashion of wearing much lace came to an end. In 1816\r\nthe introduction of 'machine net' supplanted the _vrai réseau_, the\r\ngroundwork of the lace made by hand, and this took away work from very\r\nmany people, besides lowering prices, so that the workers became\r\ndiscouraged, and the quality as well as the quantity of the lace\r\nsuffered much in consequence. Queen Adelaide tried to stimulate the\r\ndwindling trade by ordering a lace dress, every flower in which was to\r\nbe copied from Nature. The initials of the flowers chosen spelt her\r\nname:\r\n\r\n  Amaranth,\r\n  Daphne,\r\n  Eglantine,\r\n  Lilac,\r\n  Auricula,\r\n  Ivy,\r\n  Dahlia,\r\n  Eglantine.\r\n\r\nQueen Victoria's wedding-dress was made at Beer, and of later years\r\nthere has been a revival of lace-making, especially in the neighbourhood\r\nof Honiton and of Beer; and considerable quantities are made by village\r\nwomen living at home.\r\n\r\nBut lace is not the only thing that comes from Honiton. Cider is made\r\nthere, and in the reign of George II making it must have been a very\r\nprofitable occupation. Defoe notes: 'They tell us they send twenty\r\nthousand hogsheads of cider hence every year to London, and (which is\r\nstill worse) that it is most of it bought there by the merchants to mix\r\nwith their wines--which, if true, is not much to the reputation of the\r\nLondon vintners. But that by-the-bye.' As cider-making was then in such\r\na prosperous condition, it is easy to understand the tremendous outcry\r\nthat arose a few years later, when Lord Bute imposed the enormous tax of\r\nten shillings per hogshead, to be paid by the first buyer. The storm\r\nprovoked was so violent, the opposition of country gentlemen of all\r\nshades of politics so unanimous, that the Prime Minister modified the\r\ntax to one of four shillings on each hogshead, to be paid by the grower,\r\nwho was thereby rendered liable to the domiciliary visits of excisemen.\r\nThis alteration was vehemently protested against, and Pitt championed\r\nthe opposition on the grounds that it was an Englishman's pride that\r\nevery man's house was his castle, and denounced as intolerable a Bill\r\nthat allowed excisemen to invade the house of any gentleman who 'owned a\r\nfew fruit-trees and made a little cider.' The City of London sent\r\npetitions to the Commons, the Lords, and the Throne; and the counties of\r\nDevon and Hereford, the cities of Exeter and Worcester, urged their\r\nrespective Members to make all possible resistance to the tax. Lord\r\nBute's personal unpopularity increased enormously, and a shoal of\r\nsquibs, caricatures, and pamphlets appeared, in which he was held up to\r\nridicule and contempt. One caricature represented him as 'hung on the\r\ngallows over a fire, on which a jack-boot fed the flames, and a farmer\r\nwas throwing an excised cyder barrel into the conflagration. In rural\r\ndistricts he was burnt under the effigy of a _jack-boot_, a rural\r\nallusion to his name.'\r\n\r\nAn amusing story is told of Lord North in connection with this tax. Not\r\nlong after it had been imposed, he and Sir Robert Hamilton came to Ashe,\r\nnear Axminster, on a visit--Lord North, then a Lord of the Treasury,\r\ndistinctly uneasy as to the risk of coming into Devonshire, for the\r\ncounty was still seething with dissatisfaction against the Government.\r\n'He was one day thrown into great alarm by a large party of reapers,\r\nwho, having finished cutting the wheat of the estate, approached the\r\nhouse with their hooks in their hands, shouting the usual cry, \"We\r\nhave'n! we have'n!\" The portentous words Lord North applied to himself,\r\nand, pale with terror, considered himself a dead man. Sir Robert\r\nHamilton seized a sword, and was sallying forth to repulse the visitors,\r\nwhen, meeting a member of the household, an explanation took place, by\r\nwhich the fears so unconsciously excited were removed.'\r\n\r\nIt was a most ancient custom in the West--indeed, it is said to be a\r\nremnant of the pagan rite of dedicating the first-fruits to Ceres--to\r\nset aside either the first armful of corn that was cut or else some of\r\nthe best ears, and bind them into a little sheaf, called a 'neck'. A\r\nfragment of the vivid description given by Miss O'Neill in 'Devonshire\r\nIdyls' must be quoted: 'The men carried their reaping-hooks; the sheaf\r\nwas borne by the old man. Bareheaded he stood in the light of the moon.\r\nStrange shadows flecked the mossy sward on sundown as he held the\r\nfirst-fruits aloft and waved his arms.\r\n\r\n'\"We ha'un!\" cried he, and the cry was long and wailing. The strange\r\nintimation fell on the ear like an echo from pagan days. One could fancy\r\nthe fauns and weird beings of old had taught the cadence to the first\r\nreapers of earth. \"We ha'un!\" cried he, and all the men in the circle\r\nbowed to the very ground.... \"We ha'un!\" cried Jonas again, and again\r\nthe reapers bowed and waved. Then the old men took up another strain, at\r\nonce more jubilant and more resonant, and with an indescribable drawling\r\nutterance sang out \"Thee Neck!\"--sang it out three times, and twice the\r\nwaving circle of bright steel flashed.'\r\n\r\nOn leaving Honiton, if the river is followed upstream for a short\r\ndistance, the traveller will find himself close to ruined Ottery Mohun,\r\nthe home of two celebrated families in succession. Unfortunately, it has\r\nbeen entirely destroyed by fire. A farm now stands among the ruins, and\r\ntwo fine Perpendicular archways, and a deeply moulded and hooded arch\r\nover the frontdoor, alone bear witness to its former state. In the\r\nspandril above the outer archway is carved, 'amid elegant scroll-work\r\nand foliage, an arm, vested in an ermine maunch, the hand grasping a\r\ngolden fleur-de-lys'--the old coat-armour of the Mohuns; and on the\r\nother spandril 'three lions passant in pale,' the bearing of the Carews.\r\n\r\nThe Mohuns were a Norman family of distinction, but in later days were\r\nnotorious rather than famous. The old peerage having died out in the\r\nMiddle Ages, a member of a cadet branch, by shameless and persevering\r\nbegging, induced Charles I to grant him a barony. This title only\r\nsurvived a few generations, and the fifth and last bearer of it was\r\nknown as 'the wicked' Lord Mohun. His life was short--he was barely over\r\nforty when he died--but eventful, for he was twice tried before his\r\npeers, each time on the charge of being accessory to a murder, and the\r\nstory has often been told of the desperate duel in which Lord Mohun was\r\nkilled by the Duke of Hamilton, whom he had mortally wounded. Spectators\r\nburst upon the scene to discover the two principals dying on the ground,\r\nand the two seconds fiercely fighting each other.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Carews is more interesting. Ottery Mohun came to them\r\ntowards the end of the thirteenth century, through the heiress of the\r\nelder branch of Mohuns, whom John Carew married. Their names were\r\neminent in camp, court, and council, in one reign after another; but it\r\nis only possible to speak here of two, Sir Gawen, and his nephew Sir\r\nPeter, on whose death the branch that had been settled at Ottery Mohun\r\nfor three centuries became extinct in the direct line. There is not even\r\nspace for the career of another of Sir Gawen's nephews, to whom Queen\r\nElizabeth wrote, with her own hand, in regard to his efforts in subduing\r\nthe Irish:\r\n\r\n     'MY FAITHFUL GEORGE,\r\n\r\n     'If ever more services of worth were performed in shorter space\r\n     than you have done, we are deceived among many witnesses.'\r\n\r\nSir Peter's youth was spent very strangely even for that age of hazards\r\nand chances. As a child he was sent to school in Exeter, where he was so\r\nexceedingly naughty that complaints were made to his father, and Sir\r\nWilliam, who had remarkable ideas of discipline, came to Exeter, 'tied\r\nhim on a line and delivered him to one of his servants to be carried\r\nabout the town as one of his hounds, and they led him home to Mohun's\r\nOttery like a dog.' Not long afterwards he was with his father in\r\nLondon, when, 'walking in Paul's,' they met a French gentleman, an old\r\nacquaintance of Sir William's, who took a sudden fancy to the boy, and\r\noffered to bring him up in France as if he were his own son. The offer\r\nseems to have been accepted offhand, but, unfortunately for the boy, the\r\nsudden fancy drooped almost as quickly as it sprang up, and, after\r\nenjoying life for a brief moment as an indulged page, he was turned out\r\ninto the stables, 'there as a mulett to attend his master's mule.' Here\r\nhe remained till a Mr Carew, a kinsman, happened to come to the French\r\nCourt, and near the Court gate passed 'sundry lackeys and horseboys\r\nplaying together, one of whom called to another, \"Carew Anglois! Carew\r\nAnglois!\"' This attracted Mr Carew's attention. He called the boy and\r\nquestioned him, and finding 'Carew Anglois' to be his cousin, Mr Carew\r\ntook him under his protection, rebuked the fickle guardian, and trained\r\nup Peter 'for a space ... in the court of France, like a gentleman.'\r\nPeter, still very young, but extremely independent, was present at the\r\nsiege of Pavia, and as his patron had just died, and he perceived\r\n'fortune to frown upon the French side,' he went over to the Emperor's\r\ncamp, and entered into the service of the Prince of Orange. Five or six\r\nyears later he came home, bringing with him letters of highest\r\ncommendation to the King, Henry VIII, who received him with great\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\nSir Gawen and Sir Peter together took a prominent part in 1549, in\r\ndealing with the insurrection of Devonshire and Cornishmen against the\r\nReformed religion. Sir Peter, indeed, was afterwards blamed for being\r\nover-zealous, and thereby aggravating the trouble; but he was able to\r\nclear himself, and was 'well allowed and commended for what he had\r\ndone.'\r\n\r\nIn Queen Mary's reign fresh trouble arose, from which he escaped less\r\neasily. Many fervent Protestants were made uneasy by the symptoms of\r\nRomish rule that began to appear, and were still more disturbed by the\r\nnews of the Queen's projected marriage with Philip of Spain, which they\r\nfelt boded ill for their liberties, spiritual and temporal. The Carews\r\nwere in the counsel of Sir Thomas Wyatt, the Duke of Suffolk, and\r\nothers, who planned risings to depose the Queen. In a simultaneous\r\nmovement, the Carews were to raise the West under the nominal leadership\r\nof Lord Courtenay, Sir Thomas Wyatt was to raise Kent, and the Duke the\r\nMidland counties. But before the preparations were complete, suspicion\r\nfell on the Carews, and a letter was despatched from the Council,\r\ndirecting the Sheriff of Devon to send Sir Peter and Sir Gawen to\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nSir Gawen, who was in Exeter about this time, thought it best to return\r\nquietly to his own home, and because his movements now attracted an\r\nundesirable amount of attention, he one night 'went out over the walles\r\nof the said cytie yn his bowtes.' The account condescends to a touching\r\ndetail that should appeal to all. Even the agitation of flying from\r\narrest on a charge of treason could not keep Sir Gawen from feeling\r\nfootsore, and 'for that his bowtes grieved hym he cutt them upon the\r\nwaye.' Sir Gawen was arrested a few days later, and suffered a long\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Sir Peter, in answer to the summons to surrender himself, sent\r\nthe reply that he had already started for London. But meeting on the way\r\nthe bearer of a message which assured him that two of his 'dearest\r\nfriends' here failed him, he turned aside and escaped in a little boat\r\nfrom Weymouth.\r\n\r\nThose who interest themselves in dreams and visions may care to hear of\r\nLady Carew's experience at this moment. The night that Sir Peter sailed,\r\nLady Carew dreamed very vividly 'that as he was going aboard his bark,\r\nhe should fall into the seas and be drowned'; and so great was her\r\ntrouble on awaking, that she sent a messenger to the seaside to make\r\ninquiries for Sir Peter. And when the messenger arrived at Weymouth, he\r\nheard the startling news that getting 'out of the boat to enter into\r\nthe bark, his [Sir Peter's] foot slided or slipped, and he therewith\r\nfell into the seas, and had been drowned if one standing by had not\r\ntaken hold of him.'\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding several misfortunes on the way, Sir Peter arrived safely\r\nin France, where he lived an exciting and adventurous life for several\r\nyears, and was then treacherously seized and carried to England and the\r\nTower. Here the much-abused Philip proved himself a real friend, for in\r\nan admirable letter to the Queen he intercedes for 'Pedro Caro' and his\r\nwife, and Sir Peter was eventually forgiven by Queen Mary, and honoured\r\nby Queen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nBetween Honiton and Sidmouth is an inn called The Hunter's Lodge (more\r\nrecently The Hare and Hounds), and opposite the house is a block of\r\nstone, over which hovers a gruesome mystery. It is said that in the dead\r\nof night the stone used to stir in its place, and roll heavily down into\r\nthe valley, to drink at the source of the Sid, and, some say, to try to\r\nwash away its stain. Human blood has given it this power--the blood that\r\ngushed upon it when the witches slew their victims, for it was once a\r\nwitches' stone of sacrifice.\r\n\r\nFive miles to the south-west of Honiton is Ottery St Mary, a pretty\r\nlittle town built on very steep slopes, and full of interesting\r\nassociations. It lies among 'fair meadows bathed in sunshine; with the\r\nOtter river winding through them ... yonder are the red Devon steers\r\ngrazing up to their dewlaps in buttercups: beyond them dusky moors melt\r\ninto purple haze.' By making a slight détour one passes the pleasant\r\nlawns and copses of Escot. Once the property of the Alfords, Escot was\r\nbought in 1680 by Sir Walter Yonge (father of George II's unpopular\r\n'Secretary-at-War'), who built a new and large house and lavishly\r\nimproved the grounds. But prodigality was the bane of the Yonges, and\r\nnot much more than one hundred years later it passed away from Sir\r\nWalter's ruined grandson, and was bought by Sir John Kennaway.\r\n\r\nThe streets of Ottery are steep and sinuous, and both roadway and\r\nfootwalk are paved with pebbles and cobble-stones. The Manor of Ottery\r\nwas given by Edward the Confessor to the Dean and Chapter of Rouen, and\r\nit continued in their possession during the reigns of nine Kings. Then\r\nthe Dean, finding that the task of collecting his rents and dues was\r\n'chargeable, troublesome, and sometimes dangerous ... desired to sell\r\nit, and met with a very fit chapman, John Grandisson, Lord Bishop of\r\nExon.'\r\n\r\nOttery's greatest treasure is the beautiful church, a miniature of\r\nExeter Cathedral, and it is to Bishop Grandisson that its great beauty\r\nis due. He did not build the church; indeed, the shadow of a terrible\r\nscandal had fallen upon it forty-five years before his rule began. For\r\nin the year 1282 'that discreet man, Mr Walter de Lechelade,' the\r\nPrecentor of Ottery, was waylaid coming from Exeter Cathedral in his\r\ncanonical robes, and murdered by 'certain sons of perdition full of\r\nfiendish ferocity.' 'Mr Walter de Lechelade' was probably extremely\r\nunpopular locally, because he had obtained the lease for life of the\r\nManor and Church of Ottery from the authorities at Rouen, and was\r\nallowed to make all the profit he could out of the revenues. It is\r\ninteresting to note the ecclesiastical manner of dealing with such a\r\ndifficulty at that date. Out of the twenty-one persons convicted of\r\nbeing concerned in the murder, no fewer than eleven were clerics! The\r\nVicar of Ottery St Mary was among the number, and it is sad to say that\r\nsuspicion fell even on the Dean of Exeter.\r\n\r\nBishop Grandisson found an early English church. He lengthened the nave,\r\naltered the chancel, added a beautiful Lady Chapel, and raised towers on\r\nthe already existing transepts. These transeptal towers are peculiar to\r\nthis church and the other on which he spent his enthusiasm, Exeter\r\nCathedral. On one tower is a steeple--there was one on the\r\nCathedral--the lead scored by cross-slanted lines. The church is of grey\r\nstone. The nave and towers are battlemented, and at intervals in the\r\nouter walls are niches, now bereft of the figures they held. Very\r\ngraceful stone tracery is in many windows, pinnacles and crosses rise\r\nfrom the roof, and the whole effect is of an impressive building of rich\r\nand elaborate detail. The number of consecration crosses is remarkable,\r\nfor there are thirteen without and eight within the walls, and each\r\nmarks a spot touched by the Bishop with holy oil. Every one is a square\r\nstone panel, carved with an angel bearing a small cross. Some are much\r\ndefaced, but a few are still perfect, and beneath several of them are\r\nthe remains of iron supports, showing where a light was burned before\r\nthe 'cross' on great festivals.\r\n\r\nThe arches of the nave are supported by clustered columns with most\r\ndelicately carved capitals; and in the nave are two very elaborately\r\ndecorated tombs--of the Bishop's brother, Sir Otho de Grandisson, and of\r\nBeatrice, Sir Otho's wife--each under a monumental arch, with hanging\r\ntracery and a crocketed ogee canopy.\r\n\r\nThe finely carved and pierced minstrels' gallery in the Lady Chapel is\r\nan exquisite piece of work; but amongst all that is to be most admired\r\nis the exceedingly beautiful fan-tracery in the roof of the 'Dorset'\r\naisle--an aisle built by Cicely, heiress of Lord Bonville, and widow of\r\nthe Marquis of Dorset, who died in 1501.\r\n\r\nTwo short pleached alleys of limes stand within the churchyard wall,\r\nlooking down over a little square into which several streets open, and\r\nthe old stocks still lie in the shadow of the trees.\r\n\r\nBishop Grandisson obtained a licence to establish here 'a monastery or\r\ncollegiate church for a fixed number of secular canons ... governed\r\nmainly by a Warden, a Minister, and Sacrist, and a Chanter or\r\nPrecentor,' and he drew up a most comprehensive set of statutes for\r\ntheir guidance. Occasionally he issued additional 'monitions,' as, for\r\nexample, when the Warden had allowed stage-plays to be performed in\r\nchurch during the Christmas holidays. It is reasonable to suppose,\r\nhowever, that they were 'mystery plays' or 'moralities.'\r\n\r\nLord Coleridge says: 'The town was dominated by the College. The bridge\r\nby which you entered the town from the West was the bridge of the Holy\r\nSaviour. In one of its recesses the sacred light was ever kept burning,\r\ninviting those who passed to pray.' Henry VI and Henry VII both visited\r\nthe College. The Dissolution swept it away, but a part of its endowment\r\nwas devoted to founding the King's Grammar School.\r\n\r\nMany incidents befell Fairfax and his troops at Ottery. It was chosen\r\nfor their winter-quarters in 1645, and they arrived worn-out and\r\nexhausted and in great need of refreshment. Ill-fortune, however,\r\nawaited them, as the Rev. Joshua Sprigg, General Fairfax's chaplain,\r\ntells us in _Anglia Rediviva_, his account of this army's movements. A\r\nmysterious disease broke out, very fatal, so that there were 'dying of\r\nsoldiers and inhabitants in the town of Autree, seven, eight, and nine a\r\nday, for several weeks together.' A Colonel Pickering died of it, on\r\nwhom the chaplain wrote an elegy. One has heard of blank-verse that is\r\nmerely 'prose cut into lengths,' but his lines suggest that they must\r\nhave been on the rack to bring them to the right measure. The author\r\nfeared that it was the lack of action that had proved fatal.\r\n\r\n    'Must thou be scaling heaven alone,\r\n    For want of other action?\r\n    Wouldst thou hadst took that leisure time\r\n    To visit some responsal clime!'\r\n\r\nBut Sprigg's deep affection and respect cannot be disguised even by his\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nAt Ottery, Sir Thomas Fairfax received and entertained two envoys from\r\nbesieged Exeter, who came with a view to discussing the possible terms\r\nof a general peace; but their mission was, of course, unsuccessful. A\r\npleasant event was the presentation to the General of a fair jewel, set\r\nwith rich diamonds of great value, 'from both Houses of Parliament, as a\r\ntestimonial to his great services at Naseby.' The jewel was tied with 'a\r\nblue ribbon and put about his neck.' Fairfax was staying in the old\r\nChanter's House, now the property of Lord Coleridge, and the ceremony\r\ntook place in a long panelled room, with deep-set window, then called\r\nthe Great Parlour. Here also Fairfax held a deeply important conference\r\nwith the 'Lord Generall Cromwell,' when he came to decide the plan of\r\ncampaign in the West.\r\n\r\nOttery St Mary is able to pride itself on being the birthplace of the\r\npoet Coleridge, whose family had long been connected with the county.\r\nThe poet's father was Vicar, and Master of the Grammar School. Great as\r\nwas his genius, Coleridge was not in every respect worthy of his\r\nbirthplace, for in one of his letters he actually announces that he\r\nprefers Somerset to Devon!--evidence which clearly proves the\r\ncorrectness of the popular belief that poets have no judgment. But his\r\nreal affection for the Otter is shown in his sonnet to the river on\r\nwhose banks he lived in early years. Another poem, the 'Songs of the\r\nPixies,' was inspired by the Pixies' Parlour, a tiny cave with roots of\r\nold trees for a ceiling, that stands halfway up a low cliff overhanging\r\nthe river, just beyond the town. In this poem are the lines:\r\n\r\n    'When fades the morn to shadowy-pale,\r\n    And scuds the cloud before the gale,\r\n    Ere the Morn, all gem-bedight,\r\n    Hath streak'd the East with rosy light,\r\n    We sip the furze-flower's fragrant dews,\r\n    Clad in robes of rainbow hues....\r\n    Then with quaint music hymn the parting gleam\r\n    By lonely Otter's sleep-persuading stream;\r\n    Or where his wave with loud, unquiet song\r\n    Dashed o'er the rocky channel froths along;\r\n    Or where, his silver waters smoothed to rest,\r\n    The tall tree's shadow sleeps upon his breast.'\r\n\r\nOttery has other associations with literature, and it is interesting to\r\nremember that Thackeray lived near here in his youth, and that Ottery is\r\nthe 'Clavering' of _Pendennis_, which was written while he was staying\r\nat Escot Vicarage close by.\r\n\r\nA winter traveller in passing through the lanes near here recalls some\r\nbeliefs of a past generation: 'The faint chimes of St Mary's in distant\r\nOttery are playing their Christmas greeting over many a mile of\r\nmoorland. We are passing the old \"cob\" walls and grey-headed barns of a\r\nsubstantial farmstead. The cocks will crow here all the night before\r\nChristmas Day, according to the beautiful legend of the county, to bid\r\n\r\n    '\"Each fettered ghost slip to his several grave.\"\r\n\r\nThe very oxen at midnight will fall down on their knees before the\r\nmanger. The next turn brings us to the Otter rushing along some forty\r\nfeet below with angry stream.' Almost at the mouth of the river is the\r\nvillage of Otterton, and here was a Benedictine Priory, founded in the\r\nreign of King John. The Prior of this little monastery had certain\r\nprivileges. Amongst others, ten marks had to be subscribed among the\r\ntenants for 'a palfrey to be presented to a new Prior on his coming to\r\nreside in the midst of his flock, and every plough had to plough one\r\nacre of land for him annually.' He had the 'right of pre-emption of fish\r\nin all his ports, and the choice of the best fish.' Conger-eels were\r\nspecially mentioned in a marginal note. Besides this, he claimed every\r\nporpoise caught in the sea or other neighbouring waters, but paid for it\r\nwith twelve pence and a loaf of white bread to each sailor, and two to\r\nthe master of the boat from which it was caught. Lastly, the Prior\r\nclaimed the half of every dolphin. But no Prior is likely to have had\r\nmany chances of asserting this right.\r\n\r\nThe river runs into the sea by the charming little town of Budleigh\r\nSalterton; but it is more interesting to cross the water at Otterton,\r\nand passing through the village of East Budleigh, nearly opposite, to go\r\ntowards Hayes Barton, the house where Sir Walter Raleigh was born.\r\n\r\nFardell, near Ivybridge, was the ancestral home of the Raleighs, but Sir\r\nWalter's father settled at Budleigh. In front of the garden a swirling\r\nstream crosses a strip of green; and in the garden, at the right time,\r\none may see the bees busy among golden-powdered clusters of candytuft,\r\nand dark-red gillyflowers, and a few flame-rose-coloured tulips, proud\r\nand erect. The house is very picturesque; it has cob walls and a\r\nthatched roof, and is built in the shape of the letter E; a wing\r\nprojects at either end, and in the middle the porch juts out slightly.\r\nThe two wings are gabled; there is a small gable over the porch and two\r\ndormer ones over the windows at each side of it, the windows having\r\nlattice lights and narrow mullions. Dark carved beams above them show up\r\nwell against the cream-coloured walls. The heavy door is closely studded\r\nwith nails, and over it fall the delicate sprays and lilac 'butterfly'\r\nblossoms of a wistaria. The house has been little altered, and its\r\noutward appearance was probably almost the same in Sir Walter's boyhood\r\nas it is to-day.\r\n\r\nIn front of Hayes Barton is a hill covered with oak-woods, and to the\r\nwest the ground begins to slope upwards to the high moorland of Woodbury\r\nCommon. Sir Walter had a great affection for his boyhood's home, and\r\nlater, in trying to buy it back, he wrote to the then owner: 'I will\r\nmost willingly give you whatsoever in your conscience you shall deem it\r\nworth; ... for ye naturall disposition I have to that place, being borne\r\nin that house, I had rather seat myself there, than anywhere else.'\r\n\r\nTo realize Sir Walter at all adequately, he must be contemplated as\r\nsoldier, sailor, statesman, courtier, explorer, poet, historian,\r\nGovernor of colonies abroad and of very important offices at home--most\r\nof all as a seer, for his eyes discerned a light that did not dawn on\r\nhis contemporaries. He and his half-brother, Sir Humphrey Gilbert,\r\nforesaw 'that colonization, trade, and the enlargement of empire, were\r\nall more important for the welfare of England than the discovery of\r\ngold.' Major Hume, who is by no means over-prejudiced in Raleigh's\r\nfavour, has said in his 'Life of Sir Walter Raleigh': 'To him is due the\r\nundying glory of having made the great northern continent of America an\r\nEnglish-speaking country. With him it was no accident. The plan sprang\r\nfully formed from his great brain. He was greedy of gain, but he spent\r\nhis money like water in this great project. He knew full well that there\r\nwas no gold to reward him; that the profit, if any, must be slow, and\r\nmust accrue mainly to the nation, and not to an individual; and yet he\r\nlaboured on for thirty years in the face of defeat, disaster, contumely,\r\nand disgrace, in full faith and confidence that the great continent was\r\nby God's providence reserved for England.'\r\n\r\nRaleigh's biographers have wondered at his immense knowledge of naval\r\nmatters, and particularly of naval warfare, for the _Ark Raleigh_, which\r\nhe had built after his own plans, was admitted to be the best ship in\r\nthe fleet at the time of the Armada. Perhaps his genius for absorbing\r\ninformation developed very early, and Sir John Millais's picture of the\r\ntwo little boys, fascinated by the words of the sailor speaking to them\r\nof the breathless adventures he had fought through, the gorgeous sights\r\nthat he had seen in the lands overseas, helps to explain it. Most\r\nWest-Countrymen can tell a tale dramatically, as the sailor is telling\r\nit--the picture was painted at Budleigh Salterton--and it may be that,\r\nwith Raleigh's amazing faculty for gathering knowledge, he learned\r\nenough of seamanship as he grew up to enable him to grasp and hoard in\r\nhis memory every detail of the subject as it came before him in later\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to judge any character of a past century without trying\r\nto realize in many questions of conduct the gulf that lies between the\r\nformer point of view and our own, and whatever Sir Walter's faults were,\r\nhis genius was incomparably greater. His failings were those of his age,\r\nand were more than surpassed by the shortcomings of several of Queen\r\nElizabeth's very eminent statesmen. Raleigh left Oxford when he was only\r\nseventeen, and joined Mr Henry Champernowne's band of gentlemen\r\nvolunteers who were fighting for the Protestant Princes in France. After\r\nsix years' fighting he left the army and betook himself to the Middle\r\nTemple, where possibly he spent more time over lyrics than over the law,\r\nfor a biographer, describing this period of his life, passes over his\r\nlegal acquirements, but says that 'his vein for ditty and amorous ode\r\nwas esteemed most lofty, insolent, and passionate.' He and Spenser were\r\nvery congenial companions, and later Spenser, speaking of their great\r\nfriendship, said: 'He pip'd, I sang, and when he sang, I pip'd.'\r\n\r\nSir Walter left the Temple for the sea, then went to fight in Ireland,\r\nand at the time of the Armada he was Lord Warden of the Stannaries, and\r\nresponsible for the companies of tinners, who had turned to soldiering.\r\nHe planned one expedition after another to the New World, and sent them\r\nout mainly at his own expense, giving careful instructions to those in\r\ncharge to observe carefully any plants or produce of any kind that might\r\nprofit this country, whereas usually explorers searched eagerly for\r\nprecious metals alone. It was due to these instructions that the potato\r\nwas brought to England. Rumour for long maintained that Sir Walter\r\nactually brought back the plant himself, but, as a matter of fact, the\r\ncredit of this is due to Heriot, a man of science employed by Raleigh.\r\nHe showed it with the other 'commodities' he had collected to Sir\r\nWalter, who took the potatoes with him to Ireland, and planted them in\r\nhis new estate of Youghal.\r\n\r\nAnd though it was most probably Sir John Hawkins who introduced tobacco\r\ninto England, it certainly was Sir Walter who brought smoking into\r\nfashion. In parenthesis, a warning may be given that anyone who wanders\r\nfrom east to west along the south coast of Devon will be wearied beyond\r\nmeasure by the numbers of rooms, banks, porches, and gardens, shown as\r\nthe identical spot 'where Sir Walter smoked his first pipe.' Dr\r\nBrushfield, in an exhaustive article on 'Raleghana,' counts only six\r\nplaces, but _they_ reach from Penzance to Islington, and one is in\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nAfter the last dreary voyage, rendered fruitless by the contemptible\r\ndouble-dealing of James I, and during his trial, Sir Walter's\r\nself-possession and courage showed at their best. 'From eight in the\r\nmorning till nearly midnight he fronted his enemies with unshaken\r\ncourage. The bluster of Attorney-General Coke roared around him without\r\neffect. \"I want words,\" stormed the great prosecutor, \"to express thy\r\nviperous treason.\"\r\n\r\n'\"True,\" said Raleigh, \"for you have spoken the same thing half a dozen\r\ntimes over already.\"'\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of his grand views of life that within the four\r\nwalls of a prison he should undertake no less a work than the History of\r\nthe World. The unfinished history shows a depth of learning and dignity\r\nof style, very wonderful in the writings of a man who spent his life in\r\nincessant and absorbing action. It must have been the vast number of the\r\nchances and changes of life he had seen around him, and himself\r\nexperienced, that inspired him to write that splendid apostrophe: 'O\r\neloquent, just, and mighty Death! whom none could advise, thou hast\r\npersuaded; what none have dared, thou hast done; and whom all the world\r\nhave flattered, thou only hast cast out of the world and despised; thou\r\nhast drawn together all the far-stretched greatness, all the pride,\r\ncruelty, and ambition of man, and covered it all over with these two\r\nnarrow words, _Hic jacet_.'\r\n\r\nNot only in his visions of colonies was Raleigh far in advance of his\r\ntime. Major Hume quotes his ideas on trade and commerce, the\r\nstatesmanship displayed in his _Prerogative of Parliaments_, and his\r\nwritings on the construction of ships and naval tactics, to show that in\r\neach subject he had arrived at conclusions now generally accepted, but\r\nonly discovered by the public long after his death. This biographer ends\r\nby describing him as 'perhaps the most universally capable Englishman\r\nthat ever lived.'\r\n\r\nSir Walter's last lines were written a few hours before his death, in\r\nhis Bible:\r\n\r\n    'Even such is Time, that takes on trust\r\n      Our youth, our joys, our all we have.\r\n    And pays us but with age and dust;\r\n      Who in the dark and silent grave,\r\n    When we have wandered all our ways,\r\n    Shuts up the story of our days.\r\n    But from this earth, this grave, this dust,\r\n    The Lord shall raise me up, I trust!'\r\n\r\nFollowing the coast, 'running eastward with many winding and waving\r\ncreeks,' Sidmouth is soon reached. Westcote is philosophical over both\r\nSidmouth and Seaton: 'In former times, very famous ports (and every\r\nplace and man hath but his time).' Sidmouth was an important fishing\r\ntown several hundred years ago; it is now a popular watering-place, set\r\namong high red cliffs, amidst very pretty scenery, and favoured with a\r\ngreat deal of sunshine. Leading inland are very high and steep hills,\r\ndifferent in shape from most of the hills in the neighbourhood, for they\r\nare neither rounded, pointed, nor sloping, but have a curious square,\r\nrather flat-topped look, and scarped sides.\r\n\r\nFarther eastward, one comes to Branscombe, a straggling village in a\r\nbroad hollow where three valleys meet. A stream flows down each combe,\r\nand eventually all three join and run together into the sea at\r\nBranscombe Mouth. There is a great deal to admire in the steep sides and\r\nirregular curves, softened by the spreading woods in these valleys, and\r\nclose to the shore a hill rises almost precipitously for six hundred\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nA very short distance further on, the white cliffs of the tiny cove of\r\nBeer come into view. Beer is an exceptionally delightful village,\r\nbecause of its strong individuality. At the top of the inlet the houses\r\nare clustered irregularly in little offshoots, but the main street runs\r\ndown a deep cleft narrowing towards the sea between white gleaming chalk\r\ncliffs such as are rare in this county. A rapid stream races down the\r\nside of the street, and, dashing over a rock at the edge of the beach,\r\nburies itself in the shingle. Beer Head and the cliff that separates the\r\nvillage from Seaton run out into the sea, so that it is completely shut\r\nin, and from the water's edge it is impossible to see past those massive\r\nwalls standing against the sea and sky on either side. The cove is so\r\nsmall that one wonders it counts as a harbour at all, but the beach is\r\ncovered with many small boats and several heavily-built trawlers. As I\r\nsaw it, the water was a clear blue-grey, and some sea-gulls were\r\nplacidly floating a few yards from land, rising and falling as the waves\r\nrolled in, and looking as if they must be buried by each one. From Beer\r\nHead there is a splendid view of the coast; to the east, beyond Seaton,\r\nthe landslip, and Lyme Regis, the line stretches grey and dim in the\r\ndistance towards Portland; westwards, beyond Sidmouth's red cliffs, one\r\nsees how the land bends southward to Budleigh Salterton, and still\r\nfurther south towards Exmouth.\r\n\r\nThe little inobtrusive haven of Beer was in every way convenient for\r\nsmugglers, and was naturally much beloved by them. Not more than seventy\r\nor eighty years ago, all the people in the village were supposed to take\r\na share in the perils and joys of the ventures whenever they got the\r\nchance. The greatest of their number was a certain Jack Rattenbury, who\r\nbegan his life at sea when he was nine years old. Five years later he\r\nhad already decided, 'I wished to make a figure on the stage of life,'\r\nand joined a privateering expedition. The ship was captured by the\r\nFrench, and Rattenbury taken prisoner. He escaped from prison, but not\r\nfrom Bordeaux, where for more than a year he was forced to stay, and he\r\nthen sailed on his own account to America, and back to Havre,\r\nCopenhagen, and Guernsey. By the time he reached home again he was only\r\nsixteen! His life was an unceasing turmoil: smuggling, privateering,\r\nbeing impressed for the navy, and devising wiles for slipping away\r\nagain, with the variation of being taken prisoner by French or\r\nSpaniards.\r\n\r\nA steep road runs through lovely scenery from Ottery to Seaton. At\r\nintervals it passes through woods, or looks down into the misty, green,\r\nundulating country northwards; then, climbing a ridge, the sea, framed\r\nin woods, is seen over little hollows in the distant cliffs to the\r\nsouth. The road crosses a common with a few knots of wind-swept\r\nfir-trees, and runs steeply down to Seaton. On the west side of the bay\r\nthe cliffs are a creamy white; eastwards, the shades are chiefly buff\r\nand pale brown. The variety of their strata make the cliffs interesting\r\nto geologists, for here are found layers of different kinds of chalk,\r\nlimestone, greensand, marls, chert, and interspersed lines of flints.\r\n\r\nSeaton is a pleasant little town without any remarkable feature. In the\r\nchurch is this curious epitaph with the date 1633 A.D.:\r\n\r\n         JOHN STARRE\r\n         . . . . . .\r\n        Starr on hie!\r\n    Where should a starr be\r\n         But on Hie?\r\n\r\nOn the east side of Seaton is the flat wide Valley of the Axe. The river\r\nis broad and rather important-looking, but it makes a most inglorious\r\nexit into the sea, for a huge pebble ridge rises as an impassable\r\nbarrier, and the river has to twist away farther east and run out\r\nobliquely through a narrow channel. Axmouth, on the farther side, is a\r\npretty old-fashioned little village, the thatched whitewashed cottages\r\nforming a street that curves round almost into a loop, while a\r\nchattering stream runs between the houses. In the church is the figure\r\nof a tonsured priest, with chasuble, stole, and alb, supposed to be one\r\nof the early Vicars of Axmouth. At his feet lies a dog, and the legend\r\ngoes that this was not merely the customary image of a dog seen on\r\ntombs, but the effigy of his own favourite, whom he desired to be buried\r\nat his feet; and as an indemnity for this order he left a piece of\r\nground to be devoted to charitable purposes, called Dog Acre Orchard. Mr\r\nRogers, in his 'Memorials of the West,' tells us that the name remains\r\ntill to-day.\r\n\r\nA very short distance beyond is the great landslip which fell in 1839,\r\nwhen about fifty acres of the cliff slid more than a hundred feet to the\r\nshore beneath, but in such a way that part of an orchard descended with\r\nits growing trees, and they continued to flourish at their new level.\r\nMore wonderful still, two cottages settled down on to the shore, without\r\nfalling in pieces. The ground began to slide on the night of Christmas\r\nEve, and by the evening of December 26 the great mass had fallen. To the\r\nwest is a great chasm, and the cliff rises high on the seaward side.\r\nFarther east, no cliff rises beyond the chasm, but little hillocks and\r\nsand-dunes slope unevenly to the beach. The undercliff has not in the\r\nleast the barren look of an ordinary bit of waste ground touching the\r\nshore, but is covered with grass and thick undergrowth, oaks and\r\nhawthorns, and masses of ivy, and beneath them the long spear-like\r\nleaves and scarlet-berried pods of the wild-iris.\r\n\r\nIf one returns to the Axe and begins to follow up its innumerable bends,\r\none arrives opposite the little town of Colyton, which is not quite on\r\nthe river. Mr Rogers says that the name comes from the British _Collh y\r\ntun_, and has the pretty meaning of 'the town where the hazels grow.'\r\n\r\nHere is a fine church, chiefly Perpendicular, well known, among other\r\nreasons, for a richly carved tomb, on which is the effigy of a very\r\nsmall lady, a coronet on her head and a dog at her feet, with coats of\r\narms hanging above. The figure was always known by the curious name of\r\n'Little Choak-a-bone.' The old story said that the lady was the daughter\r\nof Lord Devon and his wife, Princess Katherine, daughter of Edward IV,\r\nand that she died because a fish-bone choked her. Now this has been\r\ncorrected, and it is believed that the monument is of the wife of the\r\nfifth Earl of Devon, who lived nearly one hundred years earlier. But no\r\ndisproof has been brought against the fish-bone!\r\n\r\nClose to Colyton are the ruins of an old house of the Courtenays,\r\nColcombe, which has been partly converted into a farmhouse. Here\r\nPrincess Katherine occasionally lived during her widowhood. Colcombe\r\nsuffered much in the Civil War, for it was garrisoned by Prince Maurice,\r\nwho led his troops into several skirmishes with the enemy, and during\r\none of these affairs (it is supposed) the Castle was burned down.\r\n\r\nThe poor people living near Colcombe must have had a very bad time, with\r\nenergetic Royalist and Parliamentary troops on either hand. Some sad\r\nlittle entries at this time are quoted from the diary of a serge-maker\r\nof Colyton, in which he counts up what he lost in cloth through the\r\ninroads of the 'Lyme Men' (Parliamentarians), and the 'wostard woole'\r\nand 'sarge' torn from him by 'Percy's men' (Royalists).\r\n\r\nUnluckily, it is not possible to pause among the throng of interesting\r\nmemories that are called up by almost every step of the way. One may not\r\nsketch the career of Dr Marwood, who journeyed to London from these\r\nparts and cured 'a certain noble Lord,' a favourite of Queen Elizabeth,\r\nbut returned home because, 'finding himselfe much envyed by the Court\r\nphysitians, he thought he was not safe there!'--a naïve reflection on\r\nthe doctors that reminds one of their contemporary Catherine de'\r\nMedici's creature, René of Milan, who was popularly known as\r\n_l'empoisonneur de la reine_.\r\n\r\nIt is only possible to make a brief reference to a manor, nowadays a\r\nfarm--Ashe, where the great Duke of Marlborough was born. Marlborough\r\ncan hardly be called a son, but perhaps a grandson, of the county, for\r\nthough Sir Winston Churchill was of Dorsetshire, the Churchills were an\r\nold Devonshire family, of whom one branch had migrated to the next\r\ncounty. Ashe was the home of the Duke's mother, Elizabeth, daughter of\r\nSir John Drake, and here she returned when the Civil War was just ended,\r\nand the triumphant Parliamentarians were making themselves very\r\nobjectionable, especially to such a fervent Royalist as her husband. Sir\r\nWinston was eventually forced to compound for so large a sum that it was\r\nconvenient for them to live for some years with Lady Churchill's\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nThere is, unfortunately, no space to look at the very interesting\r\nhistory of the Bonvilles, the ruins of whose old house, Shute, in its\r\nbeautiful park, among deer and woods and magnificent cedars, is close to\r\nAshe. The title became extinct in the Wars of the Roses, for the family\r\nsuffered beyond recovery, and the last Lord Bonville had the\r\noverwhelming grief of losing his only son and grandson in the Battle of\r\nWakefield. The great estates passed to his little great-granddaughter,\r\nCicely Bonville, who, more than forty years later, built the Dorset\r\naisle in the church at Ottery St Mary.\r\n\r\nThe fine building, Newenham Abbey, stood close to the outskirts of the\r\npark, and Sir Nicholas Bonville was a great benefactor to the Abbey, but\r\nit was founded by two brothers, Sir William and Sir Reginald Mohun. The\r\nAbbey Church alone was three hundred feet in length and one hundred and\r\nfifty feet in breadth, and now of all the buildings, there remain but a\r\nfew fragments of walls and the stonework of a chapel window.\r\n\r\nAxminster, not a mile away, was in Leland's day 'a pratie quik Market\r\nTown.' It was the scene of one very interesting event, for here the Duke\r\nof Monmouth's followers first met the royal troops under the renowned\r\nGeneral Monk, then Duke of Albemarle, and caused them to fly before\r\ntheir inferior undisciplined numbers. Albemarle dared not risk a battle,\r\nas he became alarmed by the temper of his troops, and feared lest they\r\nmight go over to Monmouth if they did but catch sight of their beloved\r\nhero; for the General's troops belonged to the Devonshire militia, and\r\nMonmouth was adored by all the country-people in the West. The General\r\nordered a hurried retreat, without attempting any engagement, and\r\nMonmouth marched triumphantly to Taunton. The callous brutality of\r\nSedgmoor, and the atrocious barbarities of the Bloody Assizes following\r\nit, are too intolerable to think of. A ballad has been written called\r\n'The Sorrowful Lamentation of the Widdows of the West', and one wonders\r\nwhether its obsequious tone is due to the author being a partisan of\r\nJames II, who expressed what he thought they ought to feel, or whether\r\nthe verse-maker was one in their midst, who saw that there was indeed\r\nno spirit left in them. I quote a few of the verses:\r\n\r\n    'Alas! we Widdowes of the West, whose Husbands did rebell,\r\n    Of Comfort we are dispossest, our sorrows did excell.\r\n    Here for their Crimes they lost their lives, Rebellion was the cause,\r\n    And we confess, that was their wives, they did oppose the Laws.\r\n\r\n    When _Monmouth_ came ashore at _Lime_, it was a Fatal Day;\r\n    To carry on that base design, which did their lives betray;\r\n    And many daily did presume to come unto his aid,\r\n    _Bridge-water_, _Taunton_, _Dean_, and _Frome_, the Nation to invade.\r\n\r\n    We said it was a horrid thing, and pray'd them to forbear\r\n    To take up arms against their king, who was the Lawful Heir,\r\n    Yet like distracted men they run to cast their lives away,\r\n    And we their Widdowes are undone; this is a dismal day.\r\n\r\n    Alas! we had no cause at all, our Laws was still the same,\r\n    That we should to confusion fall, and hundreds thus be slain.\r\n    They knew not what they went about; confusion did attend,\r\n    The Heavens would not bear them out, since they did thus offend.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDartmoor\r\n\r\n    'Dartmoor! thou wert to me, in childhood's hour,\r\n    A wild and wond'rous region. Day by day\r\n    Arose upon my youthful eye thy belt\r\n    Of hills mysterious, shadowy....\r\n\r\n                                   I feel\r\n    The influence of that impressive calm\r\n    Which rests upon them. Nothing that has life\r\n    Is visible:--no solitary flock\r\n    At will wide ranging through the silent Moor\r\n    Breaks the deep-felt monotony; and all\r\n    Is motionless save where the giant shades,\r\n    Flung by the passing cloud, glide slowly o'er\r\n    The grey and gloomy wild.'\r\n\r\n    CARRINGTON: _Dartmoor_.\r\n\r\nThe region of the Forest of Dartmoor and Commons of Devon is one which\r\nexcites a vast difference of opinion. For some it has an extraordinary\r\nfascination, whilst to others it is only, like a beautiful view in the\r\nHighlands which I once heard depreciated by a native--'just hills.' And\r\nthe hills on Dartmoor are not even very high. Yes Tor, till lately\r\nthought to be the highest point, is only a little over two thousand\r\nfeet; and High Willhayes, its superior, cannot claim to be more than a\r\nfew feet higher. So there are no towering heights or tremendous\r\nprecipices to explain its peculiar spell. Sir Frederick Pollock, in\r\npaying true homage to the moor, gives the reason that accounts for\r\nDartmoor's dominion--its individuality. 'The reader may think fit to\r\nobserve, and with undisputable truth, that there are many other moors in\r\nthe world. Yes, but they are not Dartmoor.' And there is no more to be\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nA very truthful and vivid description of the moor has been given by the\r\nlate Mr R. J. King: 'The dusky sweep of hills stretches away with an\r\nendless variety of form and outline; in some parts sharply peaked, and\r\ncrested with masses of broken rock; at others, rounded and massive, and\r\nlifting a long line of sombre heath against the sky. The deep hollows\r\nwhich separate the hills are thickly covered with fern and heather, over\r\nwhich blocks of granite are scattered in all directions; and, as in all\r\nsimilar districts, each valley has its own clear mountain stream, which\r\nreceives the innumerable waterfalls descending from the hill-sides. The\r\nwhole country has a solitude, and an impressive grandeur, which\r\ninsensibly carries back the mind to an earlier and ruder age.'\r\n\r\n    '... Granite-browed, thou sitt'st in grandeur lone,\r\n      Thy temples wreathed with heaven's unsalted mist;\r\n    Feet in the brine, and face veiled by the cloud,\r\n      And vestiture by changing nature wrought--\r\n    Titan of earth and sky--silent and proud,\r\n      Even beauty kneeling hath her homage brought.\r\n    Time as a shadow speeds across thy plains,\r\n      Leaving no record of his printless feet;\r\n\r\n        *     *      *      *     *\r\n\r\n    And all our generations come and go,\r\n    As snowflakes on thy shoulders melting slow.'[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: W. H. Hamilton Rogers, 'Dartmoor.']\r\n\r\nLet the time or season be what it may, the moor has some fresh charm to\r\noffer. In the early summer there is a special soft greenness, and the\r\nhot air quivers above and about the rocks; later the hill-sides are\r\ncoloured by the lilac-pink of the ling and the richer tones of\r\nbell-heather; and when the autumn leaves are fading and falling\r\n'inland,' there may come such a day of sunshine and glorious blue sky,\r\nwith the larks singing on every side among the golden furze-blossoms,\r\nthat one is able to forget the calendar. And then, amongst the great\r\nboulders covered with white lichen that lie along the sides of streams,\r\nthe leaves of the whortleberries turn scarlet over the little round\r\nfruit, with its plum-like bloom. Sometimes in winter the snow lies in\r\npatches on the hills, among stretches of pale grass and rich, dark,\r\nred-brown masses of heather. On the edge of the moor, the springs by the\r\nroadsides flow through a sparkling white border into a shining ice\r\nhollow, and, looking away, one sees snow-covered heights against a pale\r\nblue sky, in the unbroken stillness of distance. Perhaps the moor is\r\nspecially irresistible when the full moon throws its magic over hill and\r\nvalley, suggesting infinite possibilities. In the clear air the hills\r\nlook very solemn and impressive, and the long, broken reflections of the\r\nmoonbeams lie in every stream as it ripples over rocks or breaks against\r\nboulders; while the foam gleams and trembles as flakes are torn away by\r\nthe current and swallowed up by the black shadows. In such a time and\r\nplace one may learn the meaning of 'a silence that can be heard.'\r\n\r\nDartmoor rises high above the surrounding country, and keeps his white\r\nwinter livery lying upon it long time, if not washed away by rain. The\r\nair is delicious, but it must be admitted that the moor has a very ample\r\nshare of wind, rain, and mists. Faultfinders have also complained of the\r\nbogs, and occasional accidents to travellers' horses have given the\r\nmires the significant name of 'Dartmoor Stables,' although the moor\r\nponies are supposed always to be able to pick a safe path through\r\ndangerous places.\r\n\r\nFrom a certain point of view, Dartmoor reminds one of the mirror of the\r\nLady of Shalott, for here\r\n\r\n    'Shadows of the world appear.'\r\n\r\nOr, rather, the shadows of a past world are reflected in its wastes,\r\nwitnessing to prehistoric man; to the tinners, who appear out of the\r\nmists of antiquity, and who peopled the moor through the Middle Ages; to\r\nthe dawn of Christian teaching in the country; and to the Normans, with\r\ntheir forest rights and laws. Antiquities abound, although there are\r\ninstances where it is most difficult to decide whether the remains are\r\nprehistoric, or merely traces of mediæval mining. 'It is possible that\r\n\"old men's workings,\" as the traces of abandoned mines are called in\r\nthis country, may account for more of them than is generally admitted.'\r\nBut modern observations have severely excluded any fanciful theories.\r\n'Certain stone inclosures which have passed for British fortifications\r\nare now more plausibly considered to have been made (at a sufficiently\r\nremote time, we may freely allow) for the protection of cattle.'\r\nHowever, after deducting any objects of doubtful antiquity, there\r\nremain an enormous number as to which, there can be no question--stone\r\nrows, kistvaens, menhirs, large circles of upright stones, forts and\r\nbarrows, and pounds enclosing hut-circles. It is interesting to read the\r\nviews of antiquaries at different stages of the nineteenth century, and\r\ntheir flat contradictions of the opinions of their predecessors. A good\r\ninstance is given in the new edition of that mine of information, Rowe's\r\n'Perambulation of Dartmoor,' where certain verdicts as to the origin of\r\nGrimspound are quoted. 'Polwhele states that it was a seat of judicature\r\nfor the Cantred of Darius; Samuel Rowe, that it was a Belgic or Saxon\r\ncamp; Ormerod considered it a cattle-pound pure and simple; Spence Bate\r\nwas convinced that it was nothing more than a habitation of tinners, and\r\nof no great age; while now the work of the Rev S. Baring-Gould and Mr\r\nRobert Burnard goes far to show that its construction reaches back into\r\na remote past, and that its antiquity is greater than any former\r\ninvestigator dared to assign to it.'\r\n\r\nThe great numbers of prehistoric people who lived on the moor are very\r\nremarkable. 'Tens of thousands of their habitations have been\r\ndestroyed,' says Mr Baring-Gould, 'yet tens of thousands remain. At Post\r\nBridge, within a radius of half a mile, are fifteen pounds. If we give\r\nan average of twenty huts to a pound, and allow for habitations\r\nscattered about, not enclosed in a pound, and give six persons to a hut,\r\nwe have at once a population, within a mile, of 2,000 persons.' Perhaps\r\nthey climbed so high because on the lower slopes the forest was thick,\r\nand wild beasts were more to be feared, though, according to tradition,\r\nthey were certainly not free from danger on the moor; for 'wolves and\r\nwinged serpents were no strangers to the hills or valleys.' All their\r\npossessions that we are aware of belong to the early Bronze Age, when\r\nflint was used in great quantities, and bronze was known, but was rare\r\nand very valuable. The amber pommel of a dagger, inlaid with gold pins,\r\nand part of a bronze dagger blade, were found in a barrow on Hameldon,\r\nand a few other bronze weapons have been discovered; flint implements in\r\nabundance. Great numbers of flint scrapers for cleaning the skins of\r\nanimals, and small knives for cutting up meat, have been picked up;\r\narrow-heads are scarce, and it would seem that they left very few celts\r\nor axes, and spear-heads.\r\n\r\nOf the exceedingly interesting remains, perhaps the most interesting--at\r\nany rate, to the uninitiated--is Grimspound. The boundary wall, which is\r\ndouble, encloses four acres; it is from ten to twelve feet thick, but\r\nnot above five and a half feet in height. Within the circle are\r\ntwenty-four hut-circles, and in some of them charcoal and fragments of\r\npottery have been found. A brook, dipping under the walls, and passing\r\nthrough the enclosure, supplied the camp with water.\r\n\r\nDrizzlecombe, near Sheep's Tor, is rich in a variety of antiquities, for\r\nit has three stone rows, a large tumulus, a kistvaen, and a later\r\nrelic--a miner's blowing-house. One of the avenues is two hundred and\r\nsixty feet long, and one is double for a part of the way, and each of\r\nthe three starts from a menhir, or long stone. Near Merivale Bridge are\r\ntwo double stone rows, but the stones are small. Close by are a sacred\r\ncircle, a kistvaen, a pound and hut-circles, and one cairn, besides the\r\nruins of others that have been destroyed. It would be absurd to pretend\r\nto enter on such a wide subject here. Some idea of its extent may be\r\ngathered by considering one single branch of it: Mr Baring-Gould has\r\nstated that no fewer than fifty stone avenues have been observed in\r\ndifferent parts of the moor. And hut-circles and ancient track-lines are\r\nunnumbered, although very many antiquities of all kinds have been\r\ndestroyed when granite was wanted for rebuilding churches, or for making\r\ndoorways or gate-posts, or even for mending roads.\r\n\r\nThe early antiquaries discovered the hand of the Druids in certain\r\nunusual rock-shapes, now known to be the work of Nature--such as\r\nrock-basins, which are developed in the granite by the action of wind\r\nand rain; tolmens, or holed stones; and logans, or rocking-stones.\r\nGranite on the moor generally weathers irregularly, and if the lower\r\npart of a piled-up mass partly crumbles away, a huge layer of harder\r\ngranite remains balanced on one or two points, and becomes what is\r\ncalled a logan-stone. In some cases, though the slab is almost\r\nimpossible to remove, it will rock at a finger-touch. Perhaps the most\r\nstriking example on Dartmoor is the Rugglestone, near Widdecombe, which\r\nit has been calculated weighs about one hundred and ten tons; but there\r\nare several in the neighbourhood, and a logan called the Nut-Crackers is\r\nperched among the thickly scattered boulders on Lustleigh Cleave. This\r\nlovely little valley lies on the eastern edge of the moor, and the River\r\nBovey flows through it. Masses of granite crown the ridge; lower on the\r\nhill-side is a jungle of tall bracken, and the stream is overshadowed by\r\na wood, crowded with matted undergrowth and with innumerable rocks\r\ntumbled together.\r\n\r\nGranite more consistent than that found on most of the tors--that is,\r\n'not broken into the usual layers of soft beds alternating with hard\r\nlayers'--forms the great masses of rock on Hey Tor, and these have not\r\nweathered into strange, jagged outlines. William Howitt wrote a charming\r\ndescription of Hey Tor in his 'Rural Life of England,' from which I\r\nquote a few lines: 'Below, the deep dark river went sounding on its way\r\nwith a melancholy music, and as I wound up the steep road all beneath\r\nthe gnarled oaks, I ever and anon caught glimpses of the winding valley\r\nto the left, all beautiful with wild thickets and half-shrouded faces of\r\nrock, and still on high these glowing ruddy tors standing in the blue\r\nair in their sublime silence. My road wound up and up, the heather and\r\nbilberry on either hand.'\r\n\r\nA 'wonder' which has been associated with the Druids is the grove of\r\noaks called Wistman's Wood. It lies close to Two Bridges, on the slope\r\nabove the West Dart, and at a little distance looks more like a\r\nfurze-brake than a wood. All the oaks are dwarfs, stunted by the lack of\r\nsoil and force of the winds. Mr Rowe quotes from a 'botanical writer,'\r\nwho examined some of them: 'The bole of this tree was about three feet\r\nhigh, and its total height to the topmost branches fifteen feet. The\r\ncircumference of the trunk was six feet, and its prime must have been\r\nabout the date of the Norman Conquest.' Some of the boughs, like the\r\ntrunks, are immensely thick for the height of the trees, and they are\r\ncovered with very deep cushions of bright green moss and hangings of\r\npolypody, and whortleberries grow upon them. Every step between the\r\ntrees is perilous, among the uneven crowded masses of rocks and\r\nhalf-concealed clefts. Many of the boulders are moss-covered, a kind of\r\nsedge and long, flag-like grass spring among the crevices and add to the\r\npitfalls, and the whole wood really has the air of having been\r\nbewitched. Mrs Bray's impressions of it are interesting. She found the\r\nslope 'strewn' all over with immense masses of granite.... In the midst\r\nof these gigantic blocks, growing among them, or starting, as it were,\r\nfrom their interstices, arises wildly, and here and there widely\r\nscattered, _a grove of dwarf oak-trees_.... They spread far and wide at\r\ntheir tops, and their branches twist and bend in the most tortuous\r\nmanner; sometimes reminding one of those strange things called\r\nmandrakes, of which there is a superstition noticed by Shakespeare--\r\n\r\n    '\"Like shrieking mandrakes torn from out the earth.\"'\r\n\r\nThough some of the stone circles on the moor are due to miners rather\r\nthan to prehistoric man, their antiquity may very well win respect; for,\r\naccording to the views of the early nineteenth century, it was quite\r\nprobable that the Phoenicians were trading with this island for tin in\r\nthe year 1000 B.C.! It is unnecessary to say that the reasoning which\r\nsupports this theory is very ingenious, and later opinions do not allow\r\nthat the Phoenicians ever traded directly with Britain at all. The\r\nmetal, it is held, was brought to the Mediterranean coast through the\r\nmedium of 'the Veneti of what is now Vannes, and the tin trade was\r\ncarried through Gaul to Marseilles.' To take a great leap from the date\r\noriginally suggested, there is certain evidence that British tin was\r\nconveyed over this trade route in the year 40 B.C. The Romans taught the\r\nBritons better methods of mining, and how tin might be used for\r\nhousehold needs. Another long interval without any mention of the\r\nsubject brings us to the reign of the Normans, when it seems that the\r\nmines were almost entirely in the hands of the Jews. On their expulsion\r\nby Edward I, the mines were neglected for a few years, and next a\r\ncharter was granted to several Devonshire gentlemen, at their request,\r\nconferring the important privilege of holding plea of all actions\r\nrelating to the mines, 'those of lyfe, lymme, and lande' excepted.\r\nHenceforward the Devonshire miners were separated from the Cornish, and\r\nheld stannary parliaments on the top of Crockern Tor. The summit is\r\npiled with granite, and out of the rock was hewn 'a warden's or\r\npresident's chair, seats for the jurors, and a high corner stone for the\r\ncrier of the court, and a table,' says Polwhele; and here the 'hardy\r\nmountain council'--twenty-four burgesses from each of the stannary\r\ntowns--assembled. 'This memorable place is only a great rock of\r\nmoorstone, out of which a table and seats are hewn, open to all the\r\nweather, storms and tempests, having neither house nor refuge near it by\r\ndivers miles,' wrote Prince. It is much to be regretted that nearly all\r\ntraces of the court have now disappeared, and a report says that the\r\ntable and seats were carried away to be used for some buildings not far\r\noff. It is said that the last parliament was held on this tor in 1749,\r\nbut for some time before that date the court merely met on the tor, and,\r\nafter the jurors had been sworn in, adjourned to one of the stannary\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\nFrom the charter of Edward I onwards, mining seems to have prospered,\r\nwith one or two intervals of great depression, and as late as 1861\r\nseventy-four mines were being worked in Devonshire. 'Streaming' for tin\r\nwas very much practised in the Middle Ages, and the sides of valleys all\r\nover Dartmoor are scored with the works of the tin-streamers, who turned\r\nabout the streams and examined the beds for 'grain-tin.' Many of the\r\nruined 'blowing-houses' are still to be seen on the moor. Mrs. Bray\r\nmentions a curious testimony to the wildness and remoteness of the parts\r\nin which some of the miners must have worked: 'A very old woodcut ...\r\nexhibited a whole pack of hounds harnessed and laden with little bags of\r\ntin, travelling over the mountains of Dartmoor; these animals being able\r\nto cross the deep bogs of the forest in situations where there were no\r\nroads, and where no other beasts of burden could pass.'\r\n\r\nIt was owing to the mines that Dartmoor became a part of the Duchy, for\r\nthe 'metalliferous' moors of Dartmoor and Cornwall had, on that account,\r\nlong been Crown lands; and therefore, when Edward III created his eldest\r\nson Prince of Wales and Duke of Cornwall, the Chase of Dartmoor, and the\r\nCastle and Manor of Lydford were granted to him with the estates in\r\nCornwall. Dartmoor has existed as a forest practically from time\r\nimmemorial, and the date when forest laws were first imposed on it is,\r\nin the opinion of the learned, 'lost in antiquity.' The first charter\r\naffecting the state of the moor was bestowed in 1204, when King John was\r\ncompelled reluctantly to grant a Charter of Forests, disafforesting the\r\nlands that had been gradually appropriated by the Kings since Henry I.\r\nSurrounding the forest proper are lands known as the Commons of Devon,\r\nand, usually speaking, they are included in any general reference to\r\nDartmoor. Every parish in Devonshire, excepting Barnstaple and Totnes,\r\nhas a right to pasture cattle on them for the payment of a small sum.\r\nTwo classes of men have special rights in the moor: owners and occupiers\r\nof tenements within the forest, and venville tenants, or owners of land\r\nin particular vills, or towns, adjoining the forest. Claims and\r\ncounter-claims as to their exact rights and liabilities have been\r\npressed in successive centuries, but various ancient documents set forth\r\nthese tenants' rights, 'time out of mind, to take all things that might\r\ndo them good, saving green oak and venison.' These privileges include\r\npasturing all 'commonable beasts' on the moor, digging turf for fuel,\r\nstone and sand for mending houses and lands, and taking heath for\r\nthatching, 'paying their dues and doing their suits and services.' The\r\n'suits and services' involved attendance at the Prince's Courts, and the\r\ntenants' help at the time of the bullock and pony drifts--that is, when\r\nthe herds are driven off the moor by the moormen to a point chosen by\r\nthe Duchy steward, and are there identified by their owners.\r\n\r\nIn the Duchy records appear various well-known names that one does not\r\nnaturally associate with the Forest. The Conqueror granted it to his\r\nhalf-brother, Robert, Earl of Montaigne; King John gave the Earldom of\r\nCornwall to his second son, Richard Plantagenet, afterwards King of the\r\nRomans. This Prince 'much augmented the powers of the stannaries of\r\nDevon and Cornwall, and under his auspices they thrived exceedingly.'\r\nFor a short time the earldom was bestowed on Piers Gaveston; Thomas\r\nCromwell and some others had a lease of the lead-mines on the moor for\r\ntwenty-one years; the first Earl of Bedford was 'Custos of the Forest or\r\nChase of Dartmoor'; and Sir Walter Raleigh was appointed Ranger and\r\nMaster Forester, besides being Lord Warden of the Stannaries. The first\r\nperambulation of the forest boundaries probably took place in 1224, and\r\nothers have been made at intervals ever since; yet a long tale of\r\ngrievances from that date almost up to the present time might be heard\r\nfrom commoners whose rights have been encroached upon.\r\n\r\nThe bounds of property owned by religious houses at certain points were\r\nmarked by granite crosses, of which a great number are still to be found\r\non the moor. Some of them, however, were standing long before the\r\nmonasteries were built. To take one instance, the cross on Sourton Down\r\nhas an inscription which, it has been declared, belongs to the sixth\r\ncentury, and which can still be deciphered when the sun is setting and\r\nthe rays slant across it. The Abbot's Way, leading over the moor, is\r\nmarked by crosses. It ran westwards from Buckfast Abbey, and divided at\r\nBroad Rock, near Plym Head, in the middle of the moor--one branch going\r\nto Tavistock, and the other to Buckland Abbey. The path cannot now be\r\ntraced the whole way, but the crosses show the line. Beckamoor Cross (or\r\nthe Windy Post, as it is sometimes called), between two and three miles\r\nsouth-east of Tavistock, is a typical Dartmoor cross, and a fine\r\nexample, but it cannot be numbered among the very old ones, for it seems\r\nto date from the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Dartmoor village best known by name is\r\nWiddecombe-in-the-Moor, and its fame is spread by the song 'Widdecombe\r\nFair;' this is the most popular of Devonshire folk-songs, and the air\r\nserved the Devon Regiment as a march in the Boer War. But Widdecombe has\r\nmore solid claims to consideration, and one of them is the large and\r\nbeautiful church, with its very fine tower and high crocketed pinnacles,\r\neach pointed by a cross. The roof is adorned by 'bosses, carved and\r\npainted with heads, flowers and leaves, and also figures or marks which\r\nobscurely shadow forth the learning of the alchemist.' The presence of\r\nthese symbols is explained by a tradition that the church was built by\r\nminers. 'On one of the bosses is the combination of three rabbits, each\r\nwith a single ear, which join in the centre, forming a triangle--a\r\nfavourite alchemical symbol, called the hunt of Venus.' Parts of the\r\nrood-screen remain, and on the panels are painted saints and doctors of\r\nthe Church, and a king and queen. On October 21, 1638, a terrible storm\r\nraged here during service-time. First fell 'a strange darkenesse'; then\r\na terrific thunder-clap; 'the ratling thereof' was much like 'the report\r\nof many great cannons.' 'Extraordinarie lightning' flashed, 'so flaming\r\nthat the whole church was presently filled with fire and smoke,' and a\r\nsmell of brimstone, and a great ball of fire came in at the window and\r\npassed through the church. The church itself was much torne and defaced,\r\n'stones throwne from the Tower as thick as if an hundred men had been\r\nthere throwing.' Several people were killed and many 'grievously scalded\r\nand wounded.' The history of the storm has been told in verse, and the\r\nlines were painted on tablets and placed in the church. Mrs Bray found\r\n'the wildest tales' of the storm floating among the people in the\r\nneighbourhood, and, amongst them, 'One story is that the devil, dressed\r\nin black and mounted on a black horse, inquired his way to the church,\r\nof a woman who kept a little public-house on the moor. He offered her\r\nmoney to become his guide; but she distrusted him, in remarking that the\r\nliquor went hissing down his throat, and finally had her suspicions\r\nconfirmed by discovering he had a cloven foot, which he could not\r\nconceal even by his boot.'\r\n\r\nWiddecombe is called cold and bleak, and it is not only with the\r\nterrific tempest that its name is associated, for when the snow fell\r\nthickly the South Devon folk used to look--as perhaps they still\r\ndo--towards the moor, and say to the children: 'Widdecombe hills are\r\npicking their geese, faster, faster, faster.'\r\n\r\nAbout twelve miles south-west of Widdecombe is Sheeps Tor, a sharply\r\ndefined height that has given its name to the parish and tiny village\r\nthat it overshadows. Originally it was called Shettes Tor--that is,\r\nSteep Tor, the word being derived from the Celtic _syth_.\r\n\r\nHidden among the great piles of moorstone heaped upon the tor is a cave\r\nknown as the Pixies' House. Mrs Bray describes an expedition that she\r\nmade to Sheeps Tor, and how, on asking her way to the cave, she was told\r\nto 'be careful to leave a pin, or something of equal value, as an\r\noffering to these invisible beings; otherwise they would not fail to\r\ntorment us in our sleep.' Grass grows on the lower slopes, but near the\r\nsummit there spreads a 'bold and shelving sweep of about two hundred\r\nfeet, the granite ... totally bare, save where it was here and there\r\ncovered by a coating of mosses and lichens. It lies tossed about in\r\nenormous masses in every direction.' The cave itself is in the midst of\r\n'most confused masses of rock, that looked as if they had been tossed\r\nabout by the fiends in battle,' and the entrance itself is a 'cleft\r\nbetween two rocks.' A story of human interest is also connected with the\r\ncave, for here Walter Elford, Lord of the Manor, was forced to hide when\r\nthe country was being searched for him. Squire Elford was a\r\nParliamentarian, and one of the 'secluded' members of the Long\r\nParliament; but he was so far thrown into opposition by the development\r\nof the Protector's policy that he reached the point of plotting against\r\nhim, and in consequence a party of Desborough's troops were sent in\r\npursuit of the squire to his own house. Fortunately, among the huge\r\nboulders the entrance to the cave was very difficult to find, and the\r\nPixies' House proved a safe refuge until the search-parties were\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\nAbout fifteen miles from Widdecombe, on the north-west side of the moor,\r\nlies Lydford, whose size is in no way proportionate to its antiquity.\r\n'Doubtless,' says Risdon, 'in the Saxons' heptarchy, it was a town of\r\nsome note, that felt the furious rage of the merciless Danes.' And it is\r\ntrue that in 997 Lydford was burned down by them. At this time Lydford\r\nhad its own mint, and money was coined here; and in the Domesday Book it\r\nwas described as being taxed equally with London. But the village is\r\nvery conspicuously a victim of 'the whirligig of time,' and William\r\nBrowne gives a most unflattering picture of its appearance in the\r\nmiddle of the seventeenth century:\r\n\r\n    'I oft have heard of Lydford law,\r\n    How in the morn they hang and draw,\r\n      And sit in judgment after:\r\n    At first I wondered at it much;\r\n    But soon I found the matter such\r\n      As it deserves no laughter.\r\n\r\n    'They have a castle on a hill;\r\n    I took it for some old windmill,\r\n      The vanes blown off by weather.\r\n    Than lie therein one night 'tis guessed\r\n    'Twere better to be stoned, or pressed,\r\n      Or hanged, ere you come hither.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    'Near these poor men that lie in lurch,\r\n    See a dire bridge, a little church,\r\n      Seven ashes and one oak;\r\n    Three houses standing, and ten down;\r\n    They say the rector hath a gown,\r\n      But I saw ne'er a cloak:\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    'This town's enclosed with desert moors,\r\n    But where no bear nor lion roars,\r\n      And nought can live but hogs:\r\n    For, all o'erturned by Noah's flood,\r\n    Of fourscore miles scarce one foot's good,\r\n      And hills are wholly bogs.'\r\n\r\nThe Castle is not very large, and is now utterly in ruins, though the\r\nwalls of the square keep are still standing. In Browne's day it was used\r\nas the stannary prison, and was denounced in an Act of Parliament as\r\n'one of the most heinous, contagious, and detestable places in the\r\nrealm.' For many years after this Lydford was a lonely village,\r\ngenerally ignored, in spite of its fine air and beautiful scenery.\r\nTowards the moor it looks up to an irregular barrier (about a mile or so\r\ndistant) of very picturesque tors, and in the opposite direction a\r\nfertile and pleasant country spreads beneath it. The River Lyd winds\r\nthrough scenes that are always delightful and sometimes very striking,\r\nbut the cascade has been so much praised that, if seen in summer, it is\r\napt to be disappointing. Lydford Gorge, however, is properly placed\r\namong the 'wonders' of Devonshire--to use Fuller's expression. The gorge\r\nis deep and exceedingly narrow, and the sides are precipitous. The\r\nriver, rushing between blocks of stone, flows so far below the road that\r\nfrom the bridge, where the chasm is only a few yards wide, it is almost\r\ninvisible. Risdon says: 'It maketh such a hideous noise, that being only\r\nheard, and not seen, it causeth a kind of fear to the passengers,\r\nseeming to them that look down to it, a deep abyss.' A story (that may\r\nquite easily be true) is told of a man arriving late one night in\r\nLydford from Tavistock, to the amazement of Lydford people, who knew\r\nthat their bridge had been broken down. In the darkness the traveller\r\nhad noticed 'nothing more than that his horse had made a sudden spring;\r\nbut on being afterwards led to the chasm he was struck with a mingled\r\nsensation of horror, surprise, and thankfulness.'\r\n\r\nFrom an historical point of view, it is ludicrous to think of Lydford\r\nand Princetown, its neighbour (as one counts neighbours on a\r\nmoor)--Lydford, in all its glory nearly a hundred years before the\r\nConquest, and Princetown, created by the Prince Regent. It is, I\r\nbelieve, the highest village in England, and in walking up to it there\r\ncomes a feeling that this is rather like walking up a gigantic\r\nsnail-shell, and that, when one reaches the top, it _is_ the very top\r\nand end of all things. A tranquillity reigns over the tiny town which\r\neven the occasional sight of warders with their loaded rifles does not\r\nbreak; and the workaday world seems to have been left far below.\r\n\r\nBut the desolate moor as seen from this point, the bleak winds, and very\r\nfrequent rain, brought cold comfort to the French prisoners of war, on\r\nwhose account the prison was built. Their views are probably reflected\r\nin a gloomy description of Princetown, traducing the climate, which was\r\ngiven by a French writer, quoted by Mr R. J. King. 'For seven months in\r\nthe year,' says a M. Catel, 'it is a vraie Sibérie, covered with\r\nunmelting snow. When the snows go away, the mists appear.'\r\n\r\nThe lot of the French prisoners, however, was tempered by certain\r\nalleviations, and very many of them were allowed to live on parole in\r\nspecified towns, most of which are near the moor. In 1813 a large number\r\nof American prisoners of war were added to the eight thousand French at\r\nPrincetown, but for some reason were not at first allowed the same\r\nprivileges. This may help to account for the aggrieved tone in which one\r\nof them refers to his French fellow-prisoners, as well as to the\r\nBritish. Andrews wrote a journal which was afterwards published. 'The\r\nSeigneurs,' he says, 'received remittances from their friends or had\r\nmoney of their own, and were able to support themselves in a genteel\r\nmanner.' They were allowed to have plays with a stage and scenery once a\r\nmonth, and also 'had their schools for teaching the arts and sciences,\r\ndancing, fencing, and fiddling.' He criticises them severely: 'They\r\ndrink, sing and dance,' and, with a fine allusion to emphasise his\r\npoint, declares: 'But the Americans have not that careless volatility,\r\nlike the cockle in the fable, to sing and dance when the house is on\r\nfire over them.' The French were released after the abdication of\r\nNapoleon; a year later, peace was signed between England and America,\r\nand then, till 1850, the buildings were unoccupied. In that year the\r\ndecision was made that they should be used as a convict prison, and as a\r\nresult, one must agree with Sir Frederick Pollock, it 'is the ugliest\r\nthing physically and morally on the moor.'\r\n\r\nIt is pleasanter to turn back to the moor itself--to topics less out of\r\ncharacter with it. Foremost appear stories of magic, black and white,\r\nancient beliefs and legends without end. Mr King, whose knowledge of the\r\ncountry was at once vast and minute, is quoted as having said 'that he\r\nbelieved almost every form of superstition or superstitious observances\r\ncondemned in the Penitential of Bartholomew, Bishop of Exeter,\r\n1161-1184, might be found sheltering itself under the Dartmoor Tors.'\r\n(This remark must have been made about the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.) 'The same wild creed has been handed down from generation to\r\ngeneration; the same spots on the lonely moor, and the same gloomy pools\r\nin the river, that were shunned by his forefathers, are avoided as\r\n\"critical\" (to use his own word) by the Devonshire peasant now ... and\r\nwhoever may find himself in the heart of its lonely wastes when daylight\r\nis closing, and the air seems to fill with\r\n\r\n                           '\"Undescribed sounds\r\n    That come a-swooning over hollow ground,\r\n    And wither drearily on barren moors,\"\r\n\r\nwill scarcely wonder that the spirits of the elder world should not yet\r\nhave been effectually dislodged from their ancient solitudes.... The\r\nPixies, thoroughly mischievous elves, who delight to lead all wanderers\r\nastray, dwell in the clefts of broken granite, and dance on the green\r\nsward by the side of the hill streams; ... sometimes, but very rarely,\r\nthey are seen dancing by the streams dressed in green, the true livery\r\nof the small people. They ride horses at night, and tangle their manes\r\ninto inextricable knots. They may be heard pounding their cider and\r\nthreshing their wheat far within the recesses of their \"house\" on\r\nSheepstor--a cavern formed by overhanging blocks of granite. Deep river\r\npools and deceitful morasses, over which the cotton grass flutters its\r\nwhite tassels, are thought to be the \"gates\" of their country, where\r\nthey possess diminutive flocks and herds of their own. Malicious, yet\r\nhardly demoniacal, they are precisely Dryden's \"spirits of a middle\r\nsort\"--\r\n\r\n    \"Too black for heaven, and yet too white for hell,\r\n    Who just dropped half-way down, nor lower fell\"\r\n\r\n--a character which cannot, however, be assigned to their unearthly\r\ncompanions, the wish-hounds. These have no redeeming tinge of white, and\r\nbelong to the gloomiest portion of the underworld.'\r\n\r\nA true lover of the moor, and very sensitive to its element of mystery,\r\nMr King has put what he has seen and imagined into verse that must be\r\nmost appreciated by those who know the Forest best:\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE FOREST OF THE DARTMOORS.\r\n\r\n    The purple heather flowers are dark\r\n      In the hollow of the hill,\r\n    Though far along each rocky peak\r\n      The sunlight lingers still;\r\n    Dark hang the rushes o'er the stream--\r\n      There is no sound below,\r\n    Save when the fern, by the night's wind stirred.\r\n      Waves gently to and fro.\r\n\r\n    Thou old wild forest! many a dream\r\n      Of far-off glamoury,\r\n    Of gentle knight and solemn sage,\r\n      Is resting still on thee.\r\n    Still float the mists across the fells,\r\n      As when those barons bold,\r\n    Sir Tristram and Sir Percival,\r\n      Sped o'er the weary wold.\r\n\r\n    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    Then through the glens of the folding hills.\r\n      And over the heath so brown,\r\n    King Arthur leads his belted knights\r\n      Homewards to Carlyoun;\r\n    A goodly band, with long white spears,\r\n      Upon their shoulders set,\r\n    And first of all that Flower of Kings\r\n      With his golden coronet.\r\n\r\n    And sometimes, by the clear hill streams,\r\n      A knight rides on alone;\r\n    He rideth ever beside the river,\r\n      Although the day be done;\r\n    For he looketh toward the western land\r\n      Where watcheth his ladye,\r\n    On the shore of the rocky Cornewayle,\r\n      In the castle by the sea.\r\n\r\n    *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    And now thy rocks are silent all,\r\n      The kingly chase is o'er,\r\n    Yet none may take from thee, old land,\r\n      Thy memories of yore.\r\n    In many a green and solemn place,\r\n      Girt with the wild hills round,\r\n    The shadow of the holy cross\r\n      Yet sleepeth on the ground.\r\n\r\n    In many a glen where the ash keys hang\r\n      All golden 'midst their leaves,\r\n    The knights' dark strength is rising yet,\r\n      Clad in its wild-flower wreaths.\r\n    And yet along the mountain-paths\r\n      Rides forth that stately band,\r\n    A vision of the dim old days--\r\n      A dream of fairyland.\r\n\r\n'It is the wide extent of these solitary wastes which makes them so\r\nimpressive, and gives them their influence over the imagination. Whether\r\nseen at mid-day, when the gleams of sunlight are chasing one another\r\nalong the hill-side; or at sunset, when the long line of dusky moorland\r\nlifts itself against the fading light of the western sky, the same\r\ncharacter of extent and freedom is impressed on the landscape, which\r\ncarries the fancy from hill to hill, and from valley to valley, and\r\nleads it to imagine other scenes, of equal wildness, which the distant\r\nhills conceal\r\n\r\n    '\"Beyond their utmost purple rim.\"'\r\n\r\nPerhaps the scenery of Dartmoor is never more impressive than under\r\nthose evening effects which have last been suggested. The singular\r\nshapes assumed by the granite cappings of the tors are strongly\r\nprojected against the red light of the sunset, which gleams between the\r\nmany openings in the huge piles of rock, making them look like passages\r\ninto some unknown country beyond them, and suggesting that idea of\r\ninfinity which is afforded by no other object of sight in equal degree.\r\nMeanwhile, the heather of the foreground is growing darker and darker;\r\nand the only sound which falls upon the ear is that of the river far\r\nbelow, or perhaps the flapping of some heron's wings, as he rises from\r\nhis rock in the stream and disappears westward--\r\n\r\n    'Where, darkly painted on the blood-red sky,\r\n    His figure floats along.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nThe Teign\r\n\r\n                        'Ting (whose banks were blest\r\n    By her beloved nymph dear Leman) which addrest,\r\n    And fully with herself determined before\r\n    To sing the Danish spoils committed on her shore,\r\n    When hither from the east they came in mighty swarms,\r\n    Nor could their native earth contain their numerous arms,\r\n    Their surcrease grew so great, as forced them at last\r\n    To seek another soil, as bees do when they cast;\r\n    And by their impious pride how hard she was bested,\r\n    When all the country swam with blood of Saxons shed.'\r\n\r\n    DRAYTON: _Poly-olbion_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Teign rises, as do most of the rivers in Devon, on Dartmoor, and\r\nstarts across the moorlands towards the north. After a few miles it is\r\njoined by the Wallabrook, and at that point turns eastwards.\r\n\r\nThe moorland country about it is very beautiful, but especially when the\r\nheather and furze are in flower together, and far and wide stretches a\r\nmost royal display of rose-purple and gold. Ferns hang over the\r\ntransparent brown water, with its glancing lights, and tiny ferns and\r\npolypodys peer out from the crannies and hollows of big grey boulders.\r\nHere and there bushy willows grow along the edge, or a mountain-ash\r\nshows its feathery, deep green foliage and clusters of scarlet berries.\r\nA clapper bridge--that is, a bridge formed out of a single slab of\r\ngranite--over twelve feet long lies across the Wallabrook near the\r\nmeeting of the streams. Beside it grows a mountain-ash, and the\r\nquivering and wavering leaves, and their shadows that quiver and waver\r\nin the ripples beneath, make a profound contrast to that massive,\r\nimmovable stone, that from its look may certainly be included among\r\nthose Dartmoor antiquities which Sir Frederick Pollock says 'may very\r\nwell have been as great a mystery to the contemporaries of Julius Cæsar\r\nas they are to ourselves.' Modern opinion, however, denies that these\r\nbridges on the moor are of a very great age. Close by on the north\r\nstands Scorhill Circle, one of those stone circles over the history of\r\nwhich antiquaries still differ.\r\n\r\nA little farther down, on the north bank, is a tolmen, and there is a\r\ntradition that to creep through the hole brings luck. The rock has, of\r\ncourse, been associated with the Druids and their rites, but the hole is\r\nreally a natural one.\r\n\r\nAbout three miles farther down the river one arrives at Chagford, and\r\nperhaps the two things that a stranger will first notice about this\r\nlittle town are, that the air is very exhilarating and the people\r\nparticularly courteous. For the rest, though not echoing Lord\r\nClarendon's remark, that, but for the calamity of Sidney Godolphin's\r\ndeath, it is 'a place which could never otherwise have had a mention in\r\nthis world,' one must admit that it is not very remarkable. The moment\r\nwhen Chagford came most violently into contact with public affairs was\r\nthat mentioned by Lord Clarendon, and most heartily must the inhabitants\r\nhave wished themselves back in their usual peaceful solitude. Sir John\r\nBerkeley, at that time, 'with a good party, volant, of horse and\r\ndragoons,' was descending in 'all places in the surrounding country\r\nwhere Parliamentarians were known to be assembled, \"dissolving\" them,\r\nand taking many prisoners.' Of one of these 'necessary and brisk\r\nexpeditions' Chagford was the goal, and arriving very early in the\r\nmorning, still in the dark, they fell upon it before day. The chilly\r\nJanuary dawn broke over a much-discomforted town, ringing with shots,\r\nthe trampling of horses, and the clash of steel, but the Royalist troops\r\nwere sturdily resisted, and Godolphin was slain, it is said, in the\r\nporch of the Three Crowns Inn. Clarendon writes of him: 'There was never\r\nso great a mind and spirit contained in so little room;' and in his\r\naccount of the skirmish he says: 'As his advice was of great authority\r\nwith all the commanders ... so he exposed his person to all action,\r\ntravel, and hazard; and by too forward engaging himself in this last\r\nreceived a mortal shot by a musket, a little above the knee, of which he\r\ndied in the instant.' Sidney Godolphin, it will be remembered, was one\r\nof the celebrated 'four wheels of Charles's Wain, all Devonshire and\r\nCornish men, and all slain at or near the same place, the same time, and\r\nin the same cause....\r\n\r\n    '\"Th' four wheels of Charles's wain,\r\n    Grenvill, Godolphin, Trevanion, Slanning slain.\"'\r\n\r\nIn early days Chagford was one of the four Stannary towns, the others\r\nbeing Ashburton, Tavistock, and Plympton. Risdon mentions that 'This\r\nplace is priviledged with many immunities which tinners enjoy; and here\r\nis holden one of the courts for Stannary causes.'\r\n\r\nThe river flows from Chagford in a north-easterly direction till\r\nDrewsteignton stands due north, when it turns to the east. Drewsteignton\r\nis a large village, and has a granite church, the tower of which is\r\nDecorated, and the nave Perpendicular. In this parish was the barton of\r\nDrascombe, and in the reign of Edward I, Walter de Bromehall held it 'by\r\nthe sergeanty of finding our Lord the King, whensoever he should hunt in\r\nthe forest of Dartmoor, one bow and three barbed arrows. And it was let\r\nat five shillings a year rent.' One would imagine that King Edward I can\r\nseldom have found time to amuse himself so far west, and the tenant\r\nwould not find the conditions a heavy tax.\r\n\r\nThe scenery by the river is very fine all about here, and Fingle Gorge\r\nis generally considered to be the most beautiful of the many beautiful\r\nglens through which the Teign passes. It is a deep ravine with high and\r\nsteep sides, that are thickly wooded and broken by great boulders. At\r\nFingle Bridge four winding valleys meet; that is, the combe down which\r\nthe river sweeps from above curves one way, and the narrow opening into\r\nwhich it disappears twists sharply round in another. A cleft, half\r\nhidden in trees, divides the line of hills that shut in the tiny\r\nvalley-meadow on the west, and a road and a small stream scramble down a\r\nless severe descent between the high sides, from the north-east. But\r\nfrom no point near the bridge would it be more possible to see far up\r\nany cleeve, than it would be for a ladybird, perched at one end, to\r\ntrace all the lines of a stag's horn. If in one direction there was a\r\ngentle slope and smiling prospect beyond, the peculiar effect would be\r\ngone. There is a stillness, and almost a solemnity, in this little\r\nopening closed in narrowly on every side by the steep hills rising\r\nstraight above it on every side, and looking as unchanging as if what\r\nthey are to-day, that they have been since the beginning of time.\r\nBesides, there is a feeling of wildness and remoteness which cannot be\r\nexactly accounted for by the scenery. A living writer has said that\r\nthere is that, in a beautiful landscape in a country inhabited from\r\nprehistoric time, that there is not in an equally lovely scene in a new\r\ncountry. Though no tangible marks of the presence of men may be left,\r\nthere is an intangible something that makes itself felt though it cannot\r\nbe defined, and the view is on that account the more interesting, and\r\nmakes a deeper appeal to the spectator.\r\n\r\nIn Fingle Gorge, actual though not conspicuous traces of the Britons are\r\neasily found. Immediately above a precipitous ascent to the north are\r\nthe remains of an old camp, which antiquaries have decided was British.\r\nOn the opposite height is another camp, called Cranbrook Castle. 'This\r\ncamp is of irregular form, circular towards the north-east and\r\nsouth-east, but almost square on other quarters. On its south side it\r\nhas a high rampart and a deep ditch. On its northern side, the steepness\r\nof the hill formed the only defence.' It has been supposed that at this\r\nnarrow pass the last struggle the Damnonians made against the Romans\r\ntook place; but whether this were the case or not, the holders of the\r\ncamp possessed a supreme coign of vantage, and could have chosen no\r\nbetter place for checking an enemy's advance.\r\n\r\nAs the crow flies, Moreton Hampstead is about three miles south of\r\nFingle Gorge, but the roads are rambling. The name was originally\r\nMoor-Town, standing as it once did on the edge of the moor; and the\r\nmanor, like the barton of Drascombe, was held on a curious tenure.\r\n'Which manor was the Earls of Ulster in King Edward the first's age, who\r\nheld it of the king for one sparrow-hawke yearly to be yielded.' Moreton\r\nis a small place, and in these days perhaps its most marked\r\ncharacteristic is the Dancing Tree, or Cross Tree, as it is sometimes\r\ncalled, for it has grown out of the steps that encircled the now broken\r\nvillage cross. This tree, an elm, was pollarded, and the branches so\r\ntrained that it was possible to lay a dancing floor between them when it\r\nwas wanted; the floor was then railed round, and a ladder placed to lead\r\nup to it. Mr Baring-Gould, in his 'Book of the West,' quotes some most\r\ninteresting references to the tree from a journal kept by an old\r\ngentleman living at Moreton Hampstead, in the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century:\r\n\r\n'_June 4th, 1800._--His Majesty's birthday. Every mark of loyalty was\r\nshown. In the afternoon a concert of instrumental music was held on the\r\nCross Tree....\r\n\r\n'_August 19th, 1807._--This night the French officers assembled in the\r\nCross Tree with their band of music. They performed several airs with\r\ngreat taste.'\r\n\r\nThe 'French officers' were prisoners of war, staying on parole at\r\nMoreton Hampstead.\r\n\r\n'Unfortunately, and to the great regret of the inhabitants of Moreton,\r\nthe tree was wrecked by a gale on October 1, 1891.'\r\n\r\nAbout a mile to the north of Fingle stands Great Fulford, an estate\r\nmentioned in the Domesday Book, which belongs to the Fulford family.\r\nThey have owned it continuously since the reign of Richard I. Many\r\nmembers of the family have distinguished themselves, but the most\r\npicturesque figure is that of Sir Baldwin, who was 'of so undaunted\r\nresolution,' says Prince, 'that, for the honor and liberty of a royal\r\nlady in a castle besieged by infidels, he fought a combat with a\r\nSarazen; for bulk and bigness an unequal match (as the representation of\r\nhim cut in the wainscot at Fulford-hall doth plainly show); whom yet he\r\nvanquished and rescued the lady.' Sir Baldwin's name must have been\r\nwoven in many a romance and ballad in later days.\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil War, Great Fulford was garrisoned for the King, but was\r\neventually forced to surrender to Fairfax.\r\n\r\nLeaving the river and walking north-east, the wayfarer will come in time\r\nto the parish of Whitstone, rather more than three miles from Exeter.\r\nThe church has several interesting features. From the south transept a\r\nhagioscope slants through the wall to the chancel; and in one of the\r\nwindows of the north aisle is a bit of very old, though not very\r\nbeautiful, stained glass. A gallery at the west end bears a series of\r\npanels emblazoned with coats of arms. In the chancel is some Jacobean\r\ncarving, and behind the altar there stand a double row of carved eagles,\r\nmost of them drooping their heads to one side. Close to the church is a\r\nhuge tithe barn, the date of which appears to be between 1450 and 1500.\r\nIn a little entry-way joining the Rectory lie the old stocks, opposite\r\ncarved panels, and the wood of which is so old that it has almost lost\r\nits grain.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the nineteenth century, the rector of the parish,\r\nthe Rev. Charles Brown, collected a large amount of varied information\r\nconcerning the parish into a manuscript volume, and from this record the\r\npresent rector has most kindly allowed me to make some extracts. Mr\r\nBrown begins by explaining the meaning of the name, derived from the\r\nCeltic _Wad_, a hill or ridge, which became in time _Whit_, and _don_,\r\nland--Whitstone, the hill land. Whitstone certainly deserves the name,\r\nas it is high, looking towards Dartmoor, but the Celtic form is more\r\ncorrectly kept by a hill in the parish, which is still called Wadaldon,\r\nor more commonly Waddlesdown.\r\n\r\nAgainst the entries of burials in the parish register Mr Brown made\r\nbiographical notes, pithy, and quite free from that too flattering note\r\noften sounded in epitaphs. Here are some examples:\r\n\r\n'William Speare, D.D., buried 1812.... He formed a Paddock of 120 acres\r\n[of land left him in this parish]. His penuriousness was as remarkable\r\nas his taste. Often I have seen him in Exeter, whither he rode every\r\nday, with one spur only, and that tied to his boot with string.\r\n\r\n'1814.--James Hammett, 39, was before he came to reside in Whitstone, a\r\nfollower of Joanna Southcott, from whom he purchased for half a crown a\r\npiece of parchment, which was to entitle him to free admission into\r\nHeaven.\r\n\r\n'1820.--James Sutton, 82, was for many years Sexton of the Parish, was\r\nburied according to his request near the Rectory Granary. He said that\r\nthe Rector had been very kind to him; he would lie as near as possible\r\nto his house.\r\n\r\n'1829.--Ann Hexter, School-mistress at home and Mistress of the Sunday\r\nSchool many years. Was for twenty years occasionally insane, and at last\r\nnever free from lunacy.\r\n\r\n'1832.--William Earls--poor--humble--honest--was made happy by my\r\npresent of what he called \"Multiplying Glasses.\"\r\n\r\n'Thomas Lake, 85, said he had never taken medicine and would not begin\r\nat 85.\r\n\r\n'1833.--John Coven, my carpenter, 26 years, never defrauded his\r\nemployers of a minute's work; but his obstinacy was equal to his\r\nhonesty. He spent all his gains, openly declaring that the Parish should\r\nmaintain him when he could no longer work. At his death he had received\r\n£60, but he gave up to the Overseers a legacy of £30.\r\n\r\n'1834.--John How, 73. Having a pension of 4.0 a week, as Serj. of\r\nMarines, once refused a shill. from me, saying he did not want it.'\r\n\r\nThe notes include a compressed but lurid tale:\r\n\r\n'1835.--Thomas Snowden, 54. He died the day his son was christened, of\r\napoplexy.' The curate, W. Ley, had been present at a festive christening\r\ndinner, and had left Mr Snowden still entertaining a fellow guest. The\r\nseizure took place while they were alone. 'Mrs S. sent for Ley, and,\r\ntaking him into the room, said: \"That's the man who has just killed my\r\nhusband.\" That man she afterwards married.'\r\n\r\nSome interesting memoranda from the overseers and churchwardens give a\r\nglimpse of hard days in the past. In 1811 an entry shows the\r\nchurchwardens making an effort to relieve the acute distress caused by\r\nthe high price of food. Wages were particularly low, and a succession of\r\nbad harvests raised the price of wheat to famine price, whilst the war\r\nwith Napoleon prevented any grain coming into the country, from France\r\nor America. So we find rice and barley sold to poor parishioners cheaper\r\nthan they could have bought it for themselves.\r\n\r\n'_Account of Barley bought for the use of the Poor._\r\n\r\nApril and May, 105 Bushels at 13d. per Bush.; June,\r\n  135 at 11d.; August, 20 at 9s. 6d.\r\n\r\n\r\nSold at 8d. per Bush.                 loss £57 11 2 1/2\r\nFour Hogs. 12 Rice cost                      8 15 9\r\n           Sold for                          6  0 5 1/2\r\n           Loss                              2 15 3 1/2'\r\n\r\nIn 1796 there is a cryptic entry:\r\n\r\n'Paid for a man for the Navy               £11 13 0.'\r\n\r\nNothing more, though a few words in reference to the matter would be\r\nvery welcome. Possibly the best explanation is, that at a time when men\r\nwere being impressed for the navy on every hand, and the Government was\r\nmaking immense efforts to get men and money, the parish provided the\r\nbounty-money for a man, perhaps a parishioner, who had just joined with\r\nor without his good-will. But this is insecure ground, and the meaning\r\ncan but be guessed at. In 1807 there is a very different, but also\r\nunusual, item:\r\n\r\n'Mr Sowden's huntsman for killing a fox,    3s. 4d.'\r\n\r\nTo return to Mr Brown's 'Record,' the memoranda are followed by a long\r\nand very interesting list of 'Parochial Superstitions,' some of which,\r\nbut not all, are generally known. He also tells one or two stories with\r\na caustic touch where he might have suggested a supernatural atmosphere.\r\n\r\n'\"The Parsonage is haunted.\" This has been asserted for 100 years, at\r\nleast. It is still asserted, and proved too by the following story,\r\ninvented by Jacob Wright, a lively servant of mine in 1814. \"'Jacob,'\r\nsaid my master, 'come into my room. I am going to lay the ghost--don't\r\nbe frightened.' Well, we went in, and frightened enough I was when I saw\r\nthe ghost fly out of the window with _Master's hat and wig_.\"'\r\n\r\nIf only Mr Brown had had enough imagination to omit the word 'invented'!\r\nHis eyes must have twinkled again while he was enjoying the following\r\nspeech: 'It is reported that a calf with two heads has been seen in Hare\r\nLane. Hannah Splatt says: \"Though I have walked about as a nurse at all\r\nhours, I never saw anything _more frightful_ than myself.\"' The italics\r\nin both cases are his. Superstitions are followed by a long list of\r\nwords that strike him (who must have come from 'up the country') as\r\npeculiar, though many of them are commonly used to-day. And he makes one\r\ndelightful quotation. In mentioning the fact that Devonshire people say\r\n'to' where others say 'at'--far instance, 'working to blacksmith's,' or\r\n'living to Exeter'--he writes: 'Dr Atterbury used to say that if he had\r\nbeen Bishop of Exeter, the Devonshire folks would have called him Dr To\r\nTerbury.'\r\n\r\nRejoining the Teign, one descends a valley very beautiful, but less\r\nstriking than Fingle Gorge, the sides wider apart and less high, but\r\nthickly wooded. It is especially lovely in late March or early April,\r\nwhen the woodbine wreaths give an earnest of what the spring's full\r\ntouch will bring, and buds are bursting and tiny quilled leaves showing\r\non the hazels scattered among the oaks that form the chief substance of\r\nthe coppices. Near Dunsford lies a sea of blue-green daffodil spears,\r\nwith the pale gold flowers showing among them. These flowers push up\r\namong the rustling brown leaves, under interlacing branches overhead,\r\nbut at a turn of the river a large flat meadow spreads out before one,\r\nand here the daffodils indeed 'dance' in their myriads. Just beyond is\r\nthe bridge below Dunsford, and here are several tiny islands, each about\r\nlarge enough to hold a sapling and a tangle of overflowing green that\r\ntrails into the water; and rushing by on each side, after falling over a\r\nlittle weir, the river dashes itself into a line of foam and races on\r\nunder the archway.\r\n\r\nSome miles down the valley and east of the river is Doddiscombsleigh,\r\nwhose chief feature is its church. The chancel is early Decorated, the\r\nnave and north aisle Perpendicular, and in the windows of this aisle,\r\nand more especially in the east window, is some good stained glass--a\r\nrarity in the churches in this neighbourhood. The subject, a rather\r\nuncommon one in England, is the Seven Sacraments, and, as the old glass\r\nwas no longer intact, the window has been lately restored.\r\n\r\nFarther south, and on the other side of the river, is Christow, with\r\nits granite Perpendicular church. In the porch is a tribute to long\r\nservice--a stone to\r\n\r\nNICHOLAS BUSSELL, 46 years clark\r\n    Heere dyed xix Feb. 1631.\r\n\r\nTradition says that the stone marks the actual spot where he died, and\r\nthe wording of the epitaph favours the idea. It may be that he went to\r\nchurch in a very feeble state, perhaps thinking that neither parson nor\r\ncongregation could get on without him, and with a supreme effort crowned\r\nhis many years of service.\r\n\r\nThe valley has a solitary look, as if it were very remote from hurry or\r\nturmoil, with the green, silent hills rising high towards Haldon's\r\nmoorlands on one side, and to Dartmoor on the other. But when the tides\r\nof the Civil War surged backward and forward, the valley of the Teign\r\nhad its full share of trouble. Those who lived there were too near\r\nExeter for their peace and comfort, and must have been repeatedly\r\nharassed by the troops of one side or the other while they were\r\nclattering to or from the city, or quartered in the villages near, and\r\nthe commotion must have been especially trying when Fairfax was\r\nbeginning the siege of Exeter by hemming in the city with his outposts.\r\n\r\nCanonteign House was garrisoned for the King, and was considered 'a\r\nstrong fort'; but at the end of the year 1645, when the Royalist cause\r\nwas lost, it was taken by a body of troops from the regiment of Colonel\r\nOkey, who after the Restoration was executed as one of the Regicides. A\r\nshort account of the affair is given in 'Anglia Rediviva': 'Information\r\nbeing given that the house of one Mr Davis at Canonteen (being within\r\nfour miles of Exeter) stood convenient for a garrison, and might bear a\r\nuseful proportion towards the blocking up of Exeter, hindering of\r\nprovision from the Southams, some more of Colonel Okey's dragoons were\r\nordered thither to possess the same, who accordingly went and fulfilled\r\ntheir orders, December 21, and were no longer in the house; but Monday,\r\nDecember 22, in the morning, the enemy sent a force against it, who\r\nstormed the house, burnt the out-houses; yet Captain Woggan, who\r\ncommanded the dragoons, behaved himself so gallantly that he beat the\r\nenemy off, killed four, desperately wounded a lieutenant-colonel, and\r\ntook divers prisoners.'\r\n\r\nThe manor of Canonteign was bought by the first Lord Exmouth, who built\r\na new Canonteign House near the old one. In Christow Church is a\r\nmemorial of the great Admiral--the flag flown by his ship during the\r\nbattle of Algiers. A broadside ballad commemorating that splendid fight\r\nhas a fine disregard for the more pedantic rules of making verse, and\r\nthe metre is a good example of what is called 'rugged'; but those who\r\nare superior to such details will appreciate the directness and air of\r\nenjoyment that are very appropriate to the song of a gallant sailor:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF ALGIERS.\r\n\r\n    'Come, all you Britons, stout and bold, that love your native land.\r\n    Rejoicing in your victory, Lord Exmouth gave command.\r\n    Lord Exmouth will your rights maintain, as you shall plainly see,\r\n    How we all fought like lions bold, to set the Christians free.\r\n\r\n    _Chorus._\r\n\r\n    'You British tars, be steady, and maintain your glorious name;\r\n    You will ever find Lord Exmouth to lead you into fame.\r\n\r\n    'On the 17th July in Plymouth Sound we lay,\r\n    Lord Exmouth made a signal our anchor for to weigh;\r\n    We exercis'd our great guns, believe me what I say,\r\n    That we might do the best we could on that glorious day.\r\n\r\n    'When we came to Gibraltar, for three days there we lay,\r\n    Our cabins there we all knock'd down, our decks we cleared away.\r\n    That nothing in our way might be, for we their batteries saw,\r\n    Prepar'd to send their burning shot upon our decks below.'\r\n\r\nHere follows a detailed account of the order of the ships going into\r\nbattle and of the fight itself, finishing with:\r\n\r\n    'And there's one thing more I relate, which is to be admir'd,\r\n    At five o'clock that afternoon we set their ships on fire.\r\n    Our rocket-ships and fire-ships so well their parts did play,\r\n    The Algerines from their batteries were forc'd to run away.\r\n\r\n    'Now this glorious action's over, and Christians are set free,\r\n    The Algerines are bound down--there's here no slavery;\r\n    But if they break their terms of peace, Lord Exmouth doth declare\r\n    If he should visit them again, not one of them he spare.'\r\n\r\nChudleigh stands a little above, and to the east of the river. From very\r\nearly times it has been specially connected with the bishops of Exeter,\r\nfor Bishop Osbert built a palace here about 1080. In the third year of\r\nRichard II's reign the palace was fortified under a licence to Bishop\r\nBrantyngham, but now only a very few fragments of it are still to be\r\nseen. The manor of Chudleigh was bound to provide twelve woodcock for\r\nthe bishop's table on the day of his election, but should they be\r\nunobtainable, twelve pence was considered a just equivalent! In 1547\r\nBishop Vesey alienated 'the manor, town, palace, and limekiln,' and\r\nrather more than a hundred years later it came into the possession of\r\nLord Clifford. The present Lord Clifford is lord of the manor.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the fourteenth century there was a lively trade in\r\nwoollen goods, which were made here in considerable quantities, and this\r\nindustry was carried on with varying prosperity through several\r\ncenturies. In the reign of James I the trade was particularly\r\nflourishing, and, though gradually lessening, it was in existence till\r\nthe end of the reign of George II.\r\n\r\nThe people of Chudleigh are said to have been careful to favour neither\r\nside in the Civil War--a small and defenceless town, swept through by\r\neach party in turn, could hardly take any other course. In January,\r\n1646, while Exeter was still holding out against the Parliament, Fairfax\r\nand his army were quartered here. The surrounding country is very\r\npretty, and Chudleigh Rock and Chudleigh Glen are particularly\r\ndelightful. The Rock is of blue limestone, and a deep cavern runs far\r\ninto it, once supposed to be haunted by the pixies. It is still called\r\nthe 'Pixies' Parlour.' A stream runs through the Glen, and joins the\r\nTeign just below the town.\r\n\r\nNear Chudleigh is Ugbrooke Park, which, with its hills and valleys,\r\nstreams, lakes, trees, and deer, has all that is wanted to make a park\r\nbeautiful. 'Fair Rosamond' is so well known by that title alone that it\r\nis sometimes forgotten that she was a De Clifford. In her lifetime,\r\ntheir principal estate was in Herefordshire, but later the heiress of\r\nUgbrooke brought this property by marriage to Antony Clifford.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the member of the family who played the most important part in\r\nhistory is Sir Thomas Clifford, afterwards the Lord Clifford whose\r\ninitial is the first of the five that together spell 'Cabal.' In its\r\nearly days, he was the leading spirit of that famous council. One branch\r\nof the Cliffords had settled in Holland, and it was probably in staying\r\nthere with his relations that Sir Thomas had been brought to the notice\r\nof Charles II and first gained his influence over him. Lord Macaulay is\r\nnot complimentary in his references to any member of the Cabal, but such\r\ncommendations as he has to give are bestowed on Clifford. Sir Thomas, he\r\nsays, 'had greatly distinguished himself in the House of Commons. Of the\r\nmembers of the Cabal, he was the most respectable. For, with a fiery,\r\nimperious temper, he had a strong though a lamentably perverted sense of\r\nduty and honour.' Farther on he adds that Clifford 'alone of the five\r\nhad any claim to be regarded as an honest man.' Sir Thomas started a\r\nscheme which was practically the origin of the National Debt. Several\r\nstatesmen who enjoyed the King's favour greatly desired the Lord\r\nTreasurer's office, and here Charles displayed his usual astuteness;\r\nfor, being, as always, in want of money, he said to them that the man\r\nwho should be Lord Treasurer was the man who could show him a way of\r\nputting money into the Treasury. The plan that Sir Thomas proposed to\r\nthe King, and which was put into execution, Lord Clifford has most\r\nkindly sketched out as follows: 'The first Lord Clifford of Chudleigh\r\nwas made Lord Treasurer by Charles II, and recommended the King to seize\r\nthe money deposited in the Exchequer and secured by the allocation of\r\nvarious revenues. These loans had always up to this been faithfully met.\r\nBy seizing this money, nominally only for a year, he acquired the sum of\r\n£1,300,000 at 6 per cent. At the succession of William and Mary the\r\nPublic Debt was £664,263, and this was probably part of the money so\r\nseized; but it was not till 5 William and Mary, c. 20, that the\r\nauthority of Parliament was given for a loan to be raised by the then\r\ncreated Bank of England, from which period usually dates the National\r\nDebt. Evelyn ascribes the inception of this idea to Ashley Shaftesbury,\r\nwho, foreseeing its illegality, and possibly its disastrous results\r\n(for many persons were ruined), left it to Clifford to propose it to the\r\nKing. He gave 6 per cent. interest. When the Bank of England loan was\r\nraised (5 W. and M.) the interest was 8 per cent.'\r\n\r\nThere is a fine picture of the Lord High Treasurer, by Sir Peter Lely,\r\nat Ugbrooke, of which two replicas hang, one in the Treasury, and the\r\nother at Ham House, which belonged to the Duke of Lauderdale, who was\r\nthe L of the Cabal. Lord Clifford is wearing a crimson robe, under a\r\nmagnificent flowing mantle of ermine, and in his right hand is the white\r\nwand of office. His face shows shrewdness and determination, and a\r\ncertain geniality, which suggests that, though on occasion he might not\r\nhave scrupled to act as an oppressor, yet he would always have liked to\r\ndo so as pleasantly as possible.\r\n\r\nA remnant of former friendship was shown seven years after the Cabal was\r\ndissolved. In December, 1680, when the country was still seething\r\nagainst Popery, a Bill was brought before the House of Lords which\r\nprovided, amongst other things, that all Papists of influence should be\r\nremoved from their own estates to a far distant county. Lists of the\r\ngentlemen 'selected' in each county were made out (and have been\r\nreprinted among the manuscripts of the House of Lords), and after the\r\nlast list is written: 'In addition to the above Lists, there was one for\r\nDevonshire, which appears to have been given to Earl Shaftesbury ... but\r\nwhich is not forthcoming.' A subsequent collection of the names of those\r\n'selected' in this county follows this statement, but Lord Clifford's\r\nname does not appear among them; therefore Lord Shaftesbury's reason for\r\n'mislaying' this one list is supposed to be that he had suppressed in it\r\nthe name of his former friend's son; and no second formal list for\r\nDevonshire seems to have been made. The Bill never became law.\r\n\r\nAt Newton Abbot the river reaches its most southerly point and again\r\nturns east. Lysons says that its 'market and fair were spoken of in the\r\nreign of Edward I;' but there are not many old buildings, and those that\r\nthere are seem completely swamped by numerous modern ones. The parish\r\nchurch, to the south of the town, contains much that is most\r\ninteresting; and Forde House, a fine Jacobean building, welcomed under\r\nits roof Charles I on two occasions, and, having changed owners\r\nmeanwhile, greeted William of Orange, when, thirty-three years later, he\r\nwas on his way from Torbay.\r\n\r\nAlong the northern bank of the estuary lie the two villages of\r\nKingsteignton and Bishopsteignton, the manor of the first being part of\r\nthe ancient demesnes of the Crown, as that of the second was of the See\r\nof Exeter. At the Kingsteignton 'revel' a curious custom used to be\r\nobserved, for a part of the proceedings was that 'a ram was hunted,\r\nkilled, roasted, and eaten.' Mr Baring-Gould gives these details, and\r\nadds a village anecdote. 'The parson there once asked a lad in\r\nSunday-school, \"How many commandments are there?\" \"Three, sir,\" was the\r\nprompt reply--\"Easter, Whitsuntide, and the Revel.\"'\r\n\r\nBishopsteignton has a church in which there are portions of Norman work,\r\nand in the parish lie the remains of a Bishop's palace, 'From ancient\r\ntimes,' says Lysons, 'one of the country seats of the bishops.' It was\r\npractically rebuilt by Bishop Grandisson.\r\n\r\nI was once given an interesting piece of information relating to\r\nBishopsteignton by an old man living near Newton St Cyres. He said that\r\nin a general way the women there used to be very small, and folks said\r\nthat was because they had been changed by the pixies when they were\r\nbabies.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to dwell on the fact that Teignmouth, besides being a\r\nport, is a most flourishing watering-place. The colouring is very rich,\r\nand especially lovely when set off by a brilliant sky and glittering\r\nblue water. Blood-red cliffs lead north and south, and the green of\r\ngrass and plants, broken by masses of wild-flowers of all tints, here\r\nscattered thinly, there in clumps, overlaps and creeps down the face of\r\nthe rock wherever there is foothold. Between Teignmouth and Dawlish an\r\n'island-rock' of the warmest red runs out into the sea, and through an\r\narch in it the rippling water may be seen beyond. Looking down at\r\nTeignmouth from the hill on the opposite side, the town seems to run\r\nvery flatly into the angle between sea and river. In the estuary, at\r\nlow tide, the ships and boats lie in pools among the sand-banks, with\r\nthe gulls circling and screaming about them.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that 'the cliffs of Teignmouth owe their deep-red hue\r\nto the slaughter of the inhabitants by the Danes in 970, when \"the very\r\nrocks streamed with blood\"'; and the old people confidently assert that\r\nthe dwarf-elder (called hereabouts 'Danes-elder') grows only upon the\r\nsite of old battle-fields 'where the Danes' blood was spilt!' These\r\nlegends are not altogether baseless, for there is no doubt as to the\r\npitiless brutality which the Danes showed in their various incursions\r\ninto Devon between the years 894 and 1013. Drayton's image is bold and\r\ngruesome:\r\n\r\n    'When all the country swam with blood of Saxons shed.'\r\n\r\nTeignmouth was last troubled by an enemy in 1690, when Admiral de\r\nTourville, having defeated the united English and Dutch fleets off\r\nBeachy Head, sailed down the Channel and anchored one night in Tor Bay.\r\nThe Devonshire militia flew to arms. 'In twenty-four hours all\r\nDevonshire was up. Every road in the county from sea to sea was covered\r\nby multitudes of fighting men, all with their faces set towards Torbay.'\r\nDe Tourville, upon this discouraging reception, gave up any ideas he may\r\nhave had of disembarking, and merely sent some galleys to Teignmouth,\r\nwho first turned their cannon on the town and afterwards landed and\r\nburned it.\r\n\r\nThe general excitement that this attack created found voice in a ballad\r\ncalled 'The Devonshire Boys' Courage, 1690.' It is utter doggerel, but\r\nexpresses the contemporary views of the people, and was sung to a tune\r\ncalled 'Liggan Water,' a title that, according to Mr William Chappell,\r\nrefers to an Irish stream. I give only a few verses:\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: music]\r\n\r\n    'Brave _Devonshire_ Boys made haste away\r\n    When news did come from _Tinmouth-bay_,\r\n    The French were landed in that town\r\n    And Treacherously had burnt it down.\r\n\r\n    'When to the Town they did draw near,\r\n    The _French_ did straightways disappear;\r\n    Because that they had then beat down\r\n    And basely burnt poor _Tinmouth-town_.\r\n\r\n    'On _Haldon-Hill_ they did design\r\n    To draw their men up in a line;\r\n    But _Devonshire_ Boys did make them run;\r\n    When once they did discharge a Gun.\r\n\r\n    'Brave Blew coat Boys did watch them so,\r\n    They to no other place dare go;\r\n    For if they had returned again,\r\n    I'm sure the _Frenchmen_ had been slain.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    'Let _Monsieur_ then do what he can,\r\n    We'll still Reign Masters o'er the Main;\r\n    Old England's Right upon the Sea\r\n    In spight of _France_ maintain'd shall be.\r\n\r\n    'No Seaman fears to lose his Blood,\r\n    To justifie a Cause so good;\r\n    To fight the _French_, who have begun\r\n    With burning down poor _Tinmouth-town_.\r\n\r\n    'The _Cornish_ Lads will lend a hand,\r\n    And _Devonshire_ Boys will with them Band,\r\n    To pull the pride of Monsieur down,\r\n    Who basely burn'd poor Tinmouth-town.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTorbay\r\n\r\n    'Torbay, unknown to the Aonian Quire,\r\n    Nothing oblig'd to any Poet's lyre ...\r\n    The Muses had no Matter from thy Bay,\r\n    To make thee famous till great William's Day....\r\n    To _Orange_ only and _Batavia's_ Seed\r\n    Remain'd this glory, as of old decreed,\r\n    To make thy Name immortal, and thy Shore\r\n    More famous and renown'd than heretofore....\r\n    O happy, happy Bay! All future times\r\n    Shall speak of thee renown'd in foreign Climes!...\r\n    Muses have matter now, enough to make\r\n    Poets of Peasants for Torbaia's sake....\r\n    King _David's_ Deeds were sung, and Triumphs too,\r\n    And why should not Great _Orange_ have his due?\r\n    Supream in Earth, Dread Sovereign thou art;\r\n    Long may'st thou reign, we pray with all our heart.'\r\n\r\n    AVANT: _Torbaia digna Camoensis_.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for those who have had no better fortune than to see\r\nTorbay only in prints or photographs to gather more than a very\r\nimperfect idea of what its best can be. The cliffs near Paignton are\r\nred, nearer Torquay they are a warm russet, alternating with a rosy grey\r\nwhere limestone comes to the surface; and some of the rocks beneath,\r\nshining with salt water, are pink, interlined with white veins. In fair\r\nweather the warm tints of these cliffs, chequered by a green\r\nlattice-work of plants and bushes, and the rich, full colours of the\r\nsea, make a picture that is more easily remembered than described.\r\n\r\nThe great promontories of Hope's Nose and Berry Head stand between three\r\nand four miles apart at the northern and southern points of this\r\nrounded, shallow bay. Torquay itself is a new town, and only developed\r\ninto being one in the early part of the last century. At the time that\r\nthere was real fear of Napoleon making a descent on this coast,\r\nfortifications were built on Berry Head, and houses were wanted for the\r\nofficers in charge. One authority suggests that Torquay was brought into\r\ngeneral notice by serving as a lodging for the families of officers in\r\nthe Channel Fleet under Lord St Vincent, who used Torbay as an\r\nanchorage. But in any case its existence is really due to Napoleon.\r\nCertainly the growth was rapid, for Lysons, writing about 1820, speaks\r\nof Torquay as having been till lately a hamlet,--and even its name is\r\nmodern.\r\n\r\nThe one important building was the Abbey, founded in 1196 by William,\r\nLord Briwere, and endowed by him with the whole of the Manor of\r\nWolborough and part of the Manor of Torre. The probable origin of this\r\ngreat gift is interesting. The Abbey was founded soon after the return\r\nfrom Austria of the hostages who had been kept there till the ransom of\r\nKing Richard I was paid, and it has been generally supposed that, as the\r\neldest sons of the greatest noblemen were sent, Lord Briwere's only son\r\nwas among the number, and that the Abbey was a thank-offering, the fruit\r\nof a vow made by the father in regard to his son's happy return. Lord\r\nBriwere installed in the Abbey seven monks of the Premonstratensian\r\nOrder. Alicia, daughter of Lord Briwere, married Reginald de Mohun, and\r\nas, on the death of her brother, she inherited the Torre property, it is\r\neasily seen how Tor-Mohun came to be the name of the parish. Successive\r\nbequests to the monastery made it the richest house of the Order in\r\nEngland, though at the time of its dissolution there were only fifteen\r\nmonks besides the Abbot. The peace and prosperity of the Abbey were once\r\nbroken, Dr Oliver tells us in his 'Monasticon Dioecesis Exoniensis,'\r\nby a painful incident: 'In 1390, notwithstanding the Abbot's\r\nirreproachable life and manners, some malicious person spread a rumour\r\nthat he had beheaded one of the Canons of Tor called Simon Hastings.'\r\nThe Abbot was 'greatly distressed,' and the Bishop pronounced the\r\naccusation to be a falsehood of the 'blackest dye,' and, besides,\r\ndeclared that he, the said Canon, was _alive and well_. But that it\r\nshould be possible to bring such a charge against an 'irreproachable'\r\nAbbot in this casual way, and that the accusation should for a moment\r\nbe listened to, is a view of those days not often opened to one.\r\n\r\nAfter changing hands several times, the Abbey became the property of the\r\nCarys (in 1662), and their descendants still live in it. Many\r\nalterations have been inevitable, but much of the character of the\r\nbuilding still remains. Parts of the walls of the original church are\r\nstill standing, and enough of the masonry is left to show the exact\r\nplan. It was longer than any other church that has since been built in\r\nTorquay, and wanted only seven feet to equal the length of Exeter\r\nCathedral between the west end and the organ-screen. The refectory\r\nstretches towards the west; it has been converted into a chapel, and a\r\nstone cross rises from the roof. The embattled gateway and the whole of\r\nthe building near it are of a soft rose colour; beyond stands a tower,\r\nduller in tint, and at right angles the old grange, known since\r\nElizabethan days as the Spanish Barn. For the _Capitana_, the first ship\r\nof the Armada to be taken, fell to Sir Francis Drake off Torbay, and the\r\nfour hundred men captured on her were brought to Tor Abbey and\r\nimprisoned in the grange.\r\n\r\nLeaving Torquay, and going some miles to the north, and slightly inland,\r\none arrives at Haccombe, the smallest parish in England. This year\r\n(1908) the population numbers nine. It is also conspicuous for having as\r\nits Rector the sole 'Arch-priest' in the kingdom, and for its\r\nindependence, for though Haccombe Church is subject to the jurisdiction\r\nof the Bishop, it claims to be free from any ruling of the Archdeacon. A\r\ncollege or arch-presbytery was founded there in 1341, 'which college,'\r\nsays Lysons, 'consisted of an arch-priest and five other priests, who\r\nlived together in community.' The Arch-priest, or Rector, as he is\r\nusually called, is the only remaining member of the college.\r\n\r\nHaccombe passed by a succession of heiresses from the Haccombes, who\r\nheld it in the time of William I, to the Carews, during the fourteenth\r\ncentury, to which family it still belongs. On the church door hang two\r\nhorseshoes, commemorating a victory that George Carew, Earl of Totnes,\r\nwrested from his cousin, Sir Arthur Champernowne. A wager was laid as\r\nto whose horse could swim farthest into the sea, and the horse of 'the\r\nbold Carew' won. The story is told in the following ballad:\r\n\r\n    'The feast was over in Haccombe Hall,\r\n    And the wassail-cup had been served to all,\r\n    When the Earl of Totnes rose in his place,\r\n    And the chanters came in to say the grace.\r\n\r\n    'But scarce was ended the holy rite,\r\n    When there stepped from the crowd a valiant knight;\r\n    His armour bright and his visage brown,\r\n    And his name Sir Arthur Champernowne.\r\n\r\n    '\"Good Earl of Totnes, I've brought with me\r\n    My fleetest courser of Barbary;\r\n    And whether good or ill betide,\r\n    A wager with thee I mean to ride.\"\r\n\r\n    '\"No Barbary courser do I own;\r\n    But I have,\" quoth the Earl, \"a Devonshire roan;\r\n    And I'll ride for a wager by land or sea,\r\n    The roan 'gainst the courser of Barbary.\"\r\n\r\n    '\"'Tis done,\" said Sir Arthur, \"already I've won;\r\n    And I'll stake my manor of Dartington\r\n    'Gainst Haccombe Hall and its rich domain.\"\r\n    So the Earl of Totnes the wager hath ta'en.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The land is for men of low degree;\r\n    But the knight and the Earl they ride by sea.\r\n\r\n    '\"To horse! to horse!\" resounds through the hall\r\n    Each warrior steed is led from its stall;\r\n    And with gallant train over Milburn Down\r\n    Ride the bold Carew and the Champernowne.\r\n\r\n    'But when they came to the Abbey of Tor,\r\n    The Abbot came forth from the western door,\r\n    And much he prayed them to stay and dine,\r\n    But the Earl took naught save a goblet of wine.\r\n\r\n    'Sir Arthur he raised the bowl on high,\r\n    And prayed to the Giver of victory;\r\n    Then drank success to himself in the course,\r\n    And the sops of the wine he gave to his horse.\r\n\r\n    'Away they rode from the Abbey of Tor,\r\n    Till they reached the inlet's curving shore;\r\n    The Earl plunged first in the foaming wave,\r\n    And was followed straight by Sir Arthur the brave.\r\n\r\n    'The wind blew hard and the waves beat high,\r\n    And the horses strove for the mastery;\r\n    Till Sir Arthur cried, \"Help, thou bold Carew!\r\n    Help, if thou art a Christian true!\r\n\r\n    '\"Oh, save for the sake of that lady of mine!\r\n    Good Earl of Totnes, the manor is thine;\r\n    The Barbary courser must yield to the roan,\r\n    And thou art the Lord of Dartington.\"\r\n\r\n    'The Earl his steed began to restrain,\r\n    And he seized Sir Arthur's horse by the rein;\r\n    He cheered him with words, and gave him his hand,\r\n    And he brought Sir Arthur safe to land.\r\n\r\n    'Then Sir Arthur, with sickness and grief oppressed,\r\n    Lay down in the Abbey chambers to rest;\r\n    But the Earl he rode from the Abbey of Tor\r\n    Straight forward to Haccombe Chapel door.\r\n\r\n    'And there he fell on his knees and prayed,\r\n    And many an Ave Maria he said;\r\n    Bread and money he gave to the poor,\r\n    And he nailed the roan's shoes to the chapel door.'\r\n\r\nHow far this account is accurate it is difficult to say, but the\r\nChampernownes are still at Dartington.\r\n\r\nSome miles south, and a little to the west, about midway between\r\nHaccombe and Torquay, lies Kingskerswell, a village not very much heard\r\nof nowadays, but once the property of a very distinguished soldier and\r\nstatesman. 'The Lord Nicolas de Mules (or Meoles, or Molis), a\r\ncounsellor of estate, had this manor in the time of Henry III, to whom\r\nthe King granted other lands to hold by knightly service.... He was\r\nSheriff of Hampshire and Governor of Winchester Castle, and held the\r\nislands of Guernsey, Jersey, Serke, and Aureney committed to his trust.\r\nIn 23 Henry III he was Sheriff of Yorkshire, and afterwards sent\r\nAmbassador to denounce war against France, and, being an expert\r\nsoldier, was upon the King's return to England appointed Seneschal of\r\nGascoigne, being held in such esteem by Henry III that he admitted\r\nJames, his son and heir, to have education with Prince Edward at the\r\nKing's charge. Continuing still in Gascoigne, he obtained a signal\r\nvictory over the King of Navarre.' Risdon adds the information that Sir\r\nNicolas took the King 'prisoner in the field.' On his return he took\r\npart in the 'War against the Welsh,' and must have acquitted himself\r\nbrilliantly, since hereafter honours were showered upon him. He was made\r\nGovernor of the Castles of Carmarthen and Cardigan, then 'Constable of\r\nDover Castle and Warden of the Cinque-ports, and the same year Sheriff\r\nof Kent, also Governor of the Castles of Canterbury and Rochester; and\r\nof Sherborne and Corfe Castle,' in the county of Dorset. It is almost\r\nbewildering to follow his rapid plunges from one sphere of action to\r\nanother, and it certainly emphasizes the fact that the strenuous life is\r\nno novelty. It contradicts, too, a view rather generally held, that the\r\nspirit of restless daring and love of adventure that have distinguished\r\ninnumerable men of Devon belonged solely to Elizabethan days--a view\r\nthat has, no doubt, sprung up because the great lights that shone in\r\nthat glorious reign have eclipsed all lesser ones.\r\n\r\nBut the poppy of oblivion has fallen on the name of Sir Nicolas, and he\r\nis no conspicuous figure in the most local histories; even Prince does\r\nnot count him among his 'Worthies.'\r\n\r\nFrom Kingskerswell one passes through a fertile and pleasant country,\r\nwhich suggests to the passer-by that the time and labour needed in\r\nweeding and chopping down must be almost greater than that spent in\r\nsowing and growing plants. The number of orchards here has perhaps given\r\nrise to a proverb, said to be peculiar to South Devon, but calling to\r\nmind Tusser's treatise on Husbandry:\r\n\r\n    'If good apples you would have,\r\n    The leaves must go into the grave.'\r\n\r\nThis explanation of the rhyme has been suggested: 'Rather, perhaps, be\r\nin the grave--_i.e._, You must plant your leaves in the fall of the\r\nleaf.'\r\n\r\nA road leading south, then to the east, reaches Paignton, which stands\r\nalmost midway between north and south in the bay. The old town was at a\r\nlittle distance from the sea, but latterly new houses have been built in\r\nall directions, and have brought it close to the water's edge. Paignton\r\nhas a fine church, chiefly Perpendicular, but parts are of earlier work,\r\nand there is a most beautiful carved screen.\r\n\r\nThe adventures of a native of Paignton--a certain Will Adams, born about\r\n1612, 'of mean and obscure parentage'--are not to be forgotten. He was,\r\nsays Mr Norway, 'one of those \"Turkish captives\" of whom so many were\r\nlanguishing in Algiers two centuries ago, and who, there is little\r\ndoubt, were specially in the minds of the authors of the petition in our\r\nLitany, \"For all poor prisoners and captives\" ... and it may very well\r\nbe that Adams' name was coupled with this prayer on many a Sunday in\r\nPaignton Church, for the agony of his captivity lasted full five years.'\r\nAt the end of that time he and his companions, despairing of rescue, set\r\nto work on what would indeed have seemed to most people a hopeless\r\nventure. They began to make a boat with a keel twelve feet long, but\r\n'because it was impossible to convey a piece that length out of the\r\ncity, but it must be seen and suspected, they cut it in two and fitted\r\nit for joyning, just in the middle.' Then 'because boards would require\r\nmuch hammering and that noise would be like to betray them, they bought\r\nas much canvas as would cover their boat twice over.' With as much\r\n'pitch, tar, and tallow, as would serve to make a kind of tarpauling\r\ncloth, two pipe staves saw'd across ... for oars, a little bread and two\r\nleather bottles full of fresh water, and as much canvas as would serve\r\nfor a sail,' their preparations before 'launching out into the deep'\r\nwere complete. But even their courage was not the most splendid in the\r\naffair. When the prisoners had actually started, they found that the\r\nboat was overloaded, so 'two were content to stay on shore.' They were\r\n'content' to return to toil and slavery indefinitely, and to face the\r\nbitter wrath and vengeance of their captors, enraged by the loss of so\r\nmany prisoners.\r\n\r\nThose who escaped had much to endure. Their boat leaked, and the salt\r\nwater spoiled their bread. 'Pale famine stared them in the face' writes\r\nPrince, and they suffered even greater tortures from thirst and heat.\r\n'On the fifth day, as they lay hulling up and down, God sent them some\r\nrelief, viz., a tortois,' which they came upon asleep in the sea and\r\ncaught. With strength almost gone, they reached Majorca, where, luckily,\r\nthe Viceroy was kindly disposed towards them, and they started home in\r\none of 'the King of Spain's gallies.'\r\n\r\nAdams died at a good old age in his native place.\r\n\r\nThe fine cliff called Berry Head runs far out into the sea at the\r\nsouthern edge of Tor Bay, and standing back, within the bay, is the\r\nsmall and pretty town of Brixham--celebrated for its trawlers, and for\r\nbeing the landing-place of William III. The red and brown sails of\r\n'Brixham trawlers' scattered over the blue-grey waters of the bay seem\r\nvery familiar, and it is a question for consideration how many\r\nexhibitions at the Royal Academy have _not_ included a picture bearing\r\nthat title. The fishery is an old one, and in the reign of Henry VIII\r\nthe Vicar could claim personal tithes in fish equal in value to £340 of\r\nour money.\r\n\r\nFishermen and others gave a very cordial welcome to the Prince of Orange\r\nwhen he arrived on November 5, 1688. But by no one can he have been more\r\nvehemently applauded than by the author of the lines I have quoted at\r\nthe head of the present chapter--the Rev Philip Avant, Vicar of\r\nSalcombe. The poem, originally written in Latin, and translated by the\r\nauthor, takes up almost the whole of his small and rather rare volume,\r\n_Torbaia digna Camoensis_. It is in parts unintentionally amusing, and\r\nis interesting as showing how far the frenzied fervour of bigotry may\r\ncarry a naturally amiable person, for in the narrow intervals between\r\nhis torrents of denunciation it is clear that Mr Avant was, in ordinary\r\nmatters, a kindly-disposed man.\r\n\r\nA pamphlet graphically describing the 'Expedition from Torbay to\r\nWhitehall' was written by another clergyman, John Whittle by name, a\r\n'Minister Chaplain in the Army,' and from this pamphlet long extracts\r\nare given in a paper on this subject by the late Mr Windeatt. Some of\r\nthese quotations I am now venturing to repeat: 'The morning was very\r\nobscure with the Fog and Mist, and withal it was so calm that the\r\nVessels now as 'twere touch'd each other, every ship coming as near unto\r\nthe ship wherein the Prince of Orange was, as the Schipper thereof would\r\npermit them.... His Highness the Prince of Orange gave orders that his\r\nStandard should be put up, and accordingly it was done, the White Flag\r\nbeing put uppermost, signifying his most gracious offer of Peace unto\r\nall such as would live peaceably. And under that, the Red or Bloody Flag\r\nwas set up, signifying War unto all such as did oppose his designs. The\r\nSun, recovering strength, soon dissipated the Fog, and dispers'd the\r\nMist, insomuch that it prov'd a very pleasant Day. By this time the\r\npeople of Devonshire thereabout had discovered the Fleet, the one\r\ntelling the other thereof; they came flocking in droves to the side or\r\nbrow of the Hills to view us. Some guess'd we were French because they\r\nsaw divers White Flags; but the standard of the Prince, the Motto of\r\nwhich was, For the Protestant Religion and Liberty, soon undeceived\r\nthem.... Bells were ringing as we were sailing towards the Bay, and as\r\nwe landed, which many judged to be a good omen.' A little later, when\r\nthey had landed, people 'came running out at their doors to see this\r\nhappy sight. So the Prince with Marschal Schomberg, and divers Lords,\r\nKnights and Gentlemen, marched up the Hill, which all the Fleet could\r\nsee over the Houses, the Colours flying and flourishing before his\r\nHighness, the Trumpets sounding, the Haut-boys played, the Drums beat,\r\nand the Lords, Knights and Gentlemen shouted; and sundry Huzzas did now\r\necho in the Fleet, from off the Hill, insomuch that our very hearts\r\nbelow in the water were even ravish'd for going thereof.'\r\n\r\nThere is an absurd story, here quoted with mild ridicule, that on the\r\nPrince's landing he was received by the inhabitants of Brixham with this\r\naddress:\r\n\r\n    'And please your Majesty King William,\r\n    You're welcome to Brixham Quay,\r\n    To eat buck-horn and drink bohea,\r\n           Along with me,\r\n    And please your Majesty King William.'\r\n\r\nThe 'And please' must be a corruption of 'An it please,' which does make\r\nsense, but the rhyme cannot have been invented until later, for it\r\ncertainly was not within the power of a fisherman to offer 'bohea,' or\r\nany other kind of tea, in those days. 'Buck-horn' is rather puzzling,\r\nfor it gives no clue as to what it might be. Anybody who has heard of\r\nedible buck-horn (or buck's-horn) at all, would probably think of an\r\nobscure and humble salad herb, now practically forgotten, and at no time\r\na dainty to be pressed on 'King William's' notice in this manner. The\r\nEnglish Dialect Dictionary comes to the rescue by explaining that in\r\nCornwall, Devon, and Cumberland, 'buck-horn' is a name for 'salted and\r\ndried whiting.' 'Bok horñ' also appears in the Receiver's accounts at\r\nExeter (about 1488), when the citizens, having a quarrel with the\r\nBishop, tactfully sent successive presents of fish to the Lord\r\nChancellor while the case lay before him. Buck-horn is still sold in\r\nBrixham.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers' first experiences in England were not agreeable, as 'they\r\nwere marching into Camp all hours in the Night'; and some having been\r\nunlucky enough to get astray from their companies, 'it was no easy\r\nmatter to find them in the dark amongst so many thousands. It was a\r\ncold, frosty night, and the stars twinkl'd exceedingly; besides the\r\nGround was very wet after so much Rain and ill Weather; the Souldiers\r\nwere to stand to their arms the whole Night, at least to be in readiness\r\nif anything should happen, or the enemy make an Assault, and therefore\r\nsundry Souldiers were to fetch some old Hedges and cut down green Wood\r\nto burn these with, to make some Fire.'\r\n\r\nMr Windeatt, writing in 1880, gives an astonishing instance of how few\r\nlinks a chain may sometimes need in order to stretch from century to\r\ncentury. He says a gentleman gave him the following account: 'There are\r\nfew now left who can say, as I can, that they have heard their father\r\nand their wife's father talking together of the men who saw the landing\r\nof William III at Torbay. I have heard Captain Clements say he as a boy\r\nheard as many as seven or eight old men each giving the particulars of\r\nwhat he saw then. One saw a shipload of horses hauled up to the quay,\r\nand the horses walked out all harnessed, and the quickness with which\r\neach man knew his horse and mounted it surprised them. Another old man\r\nsaid: \"I helped to get on shore the horses that were thrown overboard,\r\nand swam on shore guided by only a single rope running from the ship to\r\nthe shore\"; and another would describe the rigging and build of the\r\nships, but all appeared to welcome them as friends.\r\n\r\n'My father remembered only one--\"Gaffer Will Webber,\" of Staverton, who\r\nserved his apprenticeship with one of his ancestors, and who lived to a\r\ngreat age--say that he went from Staverton as a boy with his father, who\r\ntook a cartload of apples from Staverton to the highroad from Brixham to\r\nExeter, that the soldiers might help themselves to them, and to wish\r\nthem \"Godspeed.\"'\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen of the county were more tardy in their welcome, and\r\nperhaps this is not very surprising, when one considers that they can\r\nscarcely have recovered from the terrible vengeance that seared all who\r\nhad followed Monmouth only three years before.\r\n\r\nSir Edward Seymour, formerly Speaker of the House of Commons, was one of\r\nthe first and, says Macaulay, the most important of the great landowners\r\nwho joined the Prince at Exeter. He was 'in birth, in political\r\ninfluence, and in parliamentary abilities ... beyond comparison the\r\nforemost among the Tory gentlemen of England.'\r\n\r\nSir Edward evidently rode in great state, for the Duke of Somerset, his\r\ndescendant, still has a very imposing red velvet saddle, elaborately\r\nembroidered with heraldic and other designs in silver, that 'Mr Speaker\r\nSeymour' used on this occasion.\r\n\r\nThe march was continued in the most miserable discomfort. Six hundred\r\nhorses had died either at sea or from the effects of the storm, and the\r\nmen, still suffering from a 'dissiness in the Heads after they had been\r\nso long toss'd at Sea,' had extra burdens to carry. The weather was wet\r\nand stormy, the roads were 'extreme rough and stony,' and when they\r\nencamped and lay down for the night, 'their Heads, Backs and Arms sank\r\ndeep into the Clay.' Further, their rations were so spare that when\r\nthey came on an inclosure with turnips they felt they had found a feast.\r\n'Some roasted them and others eat them raw, and made a brave Banquet.'\r\nHowever, matters improved the next day as they drew nearer to Newton\r\nAbbot. People came in crowds to see them. 'Now they began to give us\r\napplause and pray for our Success.' Hitherto they had but wavered as\r\nthey said, 'the Irish would come and cut them in pieces if it should be\r\nknown.' On approaching Newton, 'a certain Divine went before the Army,\r\nand finding 'twas their Market day, he went unto the Cross, or Town\r\nhall,' and read the Declaration of the Prince of Orange. 'To which the\r\npeople with one Heart and Voice answered Amen: Amen, and forthwith\r\nshouted for Joy, and made the Town ring with their echoing Huzzas.'\r\n\r\nSuch was the auspicious reception of the 'Deliverer of the Nation from\r\nPopery, Slavery, Brass Money and Wooden Shoes.'\r\n\r\nA very different note, jarring against this triumphal strain, is struck\r\nby a Jacobite ballad on the same event, too long to quote entirely here.\r\nIt bears the conciliatory title of\r\n\r\nTHE BELGICK BOAR.\r\n\r\n    God prosper long our noble King,\r\n      Our hopes and wishes all:\r\n    A fatal landing late there did\r\n      In Devonshire befall.\r\n\r\n    To drive our Monarch from his throne\r\n      Prince Naso took his way.\r\n    The babe may rue that's newly-born\r\n      The landing at Torbay.\r\n\r\n    The stubborn Tarquin, void of grace,\r\n      A vow to Hell does make,\r\n    To force his father abdicate\r\n      And then his crown to take.\r\n\r\n               *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Then declarations flew about,\r\n      As thick as any hail,\r\n    Who, tho' no word was e'er made good,\r\n      Did mightily prevail.\r\n\r\n    We must be Papists or be slaves,\r\n      Was then the gen'ral cry,\r\n    But we'll do anything to save\r\n      Our darling liberty.\r\n\r\n    We'll all join with a foreign prince,\r\n      Against our lawful king;\r\n    For he from all our fancy'd fears\r\n      Deliverance doth bring.\r\n\r\n               *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Then our allegiance let's cast off,\r\n      James shall no longer guide us;\r\n    And tho' the French would bridle us,\r\n      None but the Dutch shall ride us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nThe Dart\r\n\r\n    'I cannot tell what you say, green leaves,\r\n      I cannot tell what you say;\r\n    But I know that there is a spirit in you,\r\n      And a word in you this day.\r\n\r\n    'I cannot tell what you say, rosy rocks,\r\n      I cannot tell what you say;\r\n    But I know that there is a spirit in you,\r\n      And a word in you this day.\r\n\r\n    'I cannot tell what you say, brown streams,\r\n      I cannot tell what you say;\r\n    But I know that in you too a spirit doth live,\r\n      And a word doth speak this day.\r\n\r\n    'Oh! green is the colour of faith and truth,\r\n      And rose the colour of love and youth,\r\n      And brown of the fruitful clay.\r\n    Sweet Earth is faithful, and fruitful and young,\r\n      And her bridal day shall come ere long,\r\n    And you shall know what the rocks and the streams\r\n      And the whispering woodlands say.'\r\n\r\n    KINGSLEY: _Dartside_.\r\n\r\nOf all the rivers of Devonshire, the Dart claims the first place, both\r\nfor beauty and for interesting associations; and between the lonely\r\nwastes about its source on Dartmoor, and the calm, broad reaches above\r\nDartmouth, the scenery is not only always beautiful, but adds the great\r\ncharm of being beautiful in quite different ways.\r\n\r\nDrayton recognises the claim, for in the _Poly-olbion_, speaking of the\r\n'mother of rivers,' Dartmoor, he says:\r\n\r\n    'From all the other floods that only takes her name\r\n    And as her eld'st in right the heir of all her fame.'\r\n\r\nAnd a few lines later he makes Dart declaim:\r\n\r\n                ' ... There's not the proudest flood\r\n    That falls betwixt the Mount and Exmore shall make good\r\n    Her royalty with mine, with me nor can compare;\r\n    I challenge anyone to answer me that dare.'\r\n\r\nThe East Dart rises about a mile south of Cranmere Pool, and at first\r\nmakes its way through bare bogs, with great black holes gaping open here\r\nand there in the peat, tussocks of coarse grass and dry, rustling bents,\r\nisolated tufts of heather, and now and again wide spaces of waving\r\ncotton-grass. All around is 'an everlasting wash of air' and a sense of\r\nspaciousness, which it is to be hoped no cynically named 'improvements'\r\nmay ever diminish. Westcote comments on the name. 'Of some it is\r\nsupposed that the river takes name of the swiftness of the current; the\r\nlike is thought of the river Arrow in Warwickshire, and of the Tygris in\r\nMesopotamia, which among the Persians doth import a shaft.'\r\n\r\nThere is a saying that 'the river \"cries\" when there is to be a change\r\nof wind. \"Us shall have bad weather, maister; I hear the Broadstones\r\na-crying.\" The Broadstones are boulders of granite lying in the bed of\r\nthe river. The cry, however, hardly comes from them, but from a piping\r\nof the wind, in the twists of the glen through which the turbulent river\r\nwrithes.'\r\n\r\nMany tales on the Moor speak of the amazing swiftness with which a\r\nfreshet will suddenly swell and sweep down, an overwhelming flood. Only\r\na few years ago a farmer was crossing a very safe ford when he saw the\r\nfreshet coming, and tried to hurry his horse, but before he could reach\r\nthe bank the torrent caught his cart and overturned it, and he and his\r\nhorse were drowned.\r\n\r\n    'River of Dart, O river of Dart,\r\n    Every year thou claimest a heart.'\r\n\r\nThe ominous couplet springs from no misty legend, but from melancholy\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThe East Dart runs throughout its course in a south-easterly direction,\r\nand at Post Bridge just below the road from Moreton Hampstead to\r\nTavistock it is crossed by an old bridge, one of the many rugged\r\nwitnesses to unwritten history scattered all over Dartmoor. It is a\r\nmassive structure, built of rough granite blocks; the 'table-stones'\r\nthat rest on the piers are each about fifteen feet long.\r\n\r\nThe West Dart rises farther south than the East Dart, and runs almost\r\ndue south as far as Two Bridges, and then, in many curves to the\r\neast--sometimes almost hidden in the depths of the hollow that has been\r\nworn between the high bare sides of the valley--till about five miles\r\nfrom Two Bridges it reaches Dartmeet. From the top of a tor close to the\r\npoint where the two streams meet the effect is rather curious, for sunk\r\ndeep between the wide barren stretches of moor and desolate tors, broad\r\ngreen ribbons of trees and undergrowth, broken by tufts and uneven\r\nedges, mark the course of the rivers till they wind away out of sight.\r\nTheir darker green makes them stand out against the sides of the\r\nvalleys, and they are the only trees in sight. In summer the river is\r\noften very low, and then masses of great boulders in the river-bed are\r\nseen, and some of the biggest are crowned with ferns, high tufts of\r\ngrass, or little bushes, with the clearest water streams between them.\r\nThe bridge is over the East Dart, above the meeting of the waters, and\r\nfrom just below it is possible to get a charming view of the arches\r\nthrown up against a sunlit mass of shimmering leaves.\r\n\r\nFrom here the Dart runs south almost to Holne, the birthplace of that\r\ntrue lover of Devon, Charles Kingsley. At this point it makes a great\r\nloop to the north, flowing among lovely scenery along a steep and narrow\r\nvalley, where great rocks break through the woods; then curving round in\r\nHolne Chase, it turns south again to Holne Bridge, which is crossed by\r\nthe Ashburton road. The town is about three miles to the east.\r\n\r\nAshburton is one of the old stannary towns, and besides mining, it was\r\nknown for its trade in woollen goods, especially serges. In fact, 'the\r\nseal of the Port-reeve bears a church between a teasel and a saltire,\r\nwith the sun and moon above.' The teasel was used to raise the nap in\r\nmaking cloth, and was a symbol of that industry, as the sun and moon\r\nwere symbols of mining. In 1697 the manufacturers felt foreign\r\ncompetition so keenly that the Port-reeve, traders, and inhabitants of\r\nAshburton signed a petition to Parliament, begging that an Act might be\r\npassed to discourage the importation of Irish and other foreign woollen\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\nThis borough sent members to Parliament from the reign of Edward I, but\r\nin time its representation ceased. The privilege was given back to the\r\nborough after the Restoration, through the intervention of Sir John\r\nNorthcote, and was held until Ashburton was disfranchised in 1868.\r\n\r\nA few miles farther down the river is Buckfastleigh, a small but very\r\nflourishing town, and one of the very few that still produce the serges\r\nand woollen goods for which the county was once famous, in the sixteenth\r\ncentury especially, for then, as Green tells us, 'the broadcloths of the\r\nWest claimed the palm among the woollen stuffs of England.' The church\r\nstands apart on a height overlooking the town, and the tapering spire\r\nadds to the effect given by its commanding position. By far the most\r\ninteresting building here is Buckfast Abbey, founded in the reign of\r\nHenry II, on the site of a Benedictine abbey of Saxon days. The place\r\nmust have been very remote and inaccessible when the Benedictines first\r\nsettled there, and the Saxon name given in Bishop Ælfwold's charter in\r\n1016 was 'Buckfæsten, _i.e._, Deer-fastness,' which would seem to argue\r\nthat the Abbey was surrounded by thick woods, and was particularly\r\nlonely, even for those times. Sable, a crozier in pale, argent, the\r\ncrook or, surmounted by a buck's head, caboshed of the second, horned\r\ngules, were the ancient arms of the Abbey, as they are still, though now\r\nimpaled with the Clifford arms, by permission of Lord Clifford.\r\n\r\nThe second colony of monks here were Cistercians, and the monastery\r\nbecame very prosperous and the richest house of that order in the\r\ncounty. King John deposited some of his jewels, gold and silver in their\r\nkeeping, and in 1297 Edward I visited the Abbey. The Cistercians were\r\ngreat wool-traders, and did much for both trade and agriculture in the\r\ndistricts near them. It has been supposed that the sunken track called\r\nthe Abbot's Way was used in carrying the wool from the moorland farms\r\nbelonging to the monastery towards Plymouth and Tavistock. In the\r\nthirteenth century the monks showed their interest in trading by\r\njoining the 'Gild Merchant' of Totnes. A memorandum on the back of one\r\nof the 'membership rolls' in 1236 records an agreement between the\r\nburgesses of Totnes and the abbot and convent of Buckfast; that the\r\nmonks might be able 'to make all their purchases in like manner with the\r\nburgesses, the abbot and monks agree to pay twenty-two pence on the\r\nSaturday before Christmas day.'[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Transactions of the Devonshire Association, 1873.]\r\n\r\nThe buildings at the time of the Dissolution were very large, and there\r\nwas a fine church, but of these only a Perpendicular tower adjoining the\r\ncloisters, and a large tithe-barn, are in a state of good preservation\r\nat the present day. A modern house was built on the western side of the\r\nvanished cloisters, but in 1882 the Abbey was bought for a colony of\r\nBenedictine monks from Pierrequivire in Burgundy, who have partly\r\nrebuilt the monastery on its ancient lines, and are restoring the Abbey\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nA few miles away to the south-west is Dean Prior, and the living that\r\nHerrick held when he poured out his grumbles and complaints about 'dull\r\nDevonshire.' Herrick was a true Cockney, and the earliest part of his\r\nlife was spent in a house in Cheapside. When he grew up, he had the good\r\nluck to come into the brilliant and witty company that gathered round\r\nBen Jonson, so it must be allowed that he had an excuse for sometimes\r\nthinking that life in an obscure hamlet, two hundred miles from London,\r\nwas a dreary exile. But, as Mr R. J. King remarks, in spite of all his\r\ngrievances, he had in him a sense that responded very readily to the\r\npretty customs and observances of the village, that marked, here with a\r\nhandful of flowers, there with a sheaf of wheat or a branch of holly,\r\nthe different festivals of the year.\r\n\r\nHerrick's poem 'Christmas Eve' refers to a local custom that appealed to\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n    'Come, guard this night the Christmas-pie,\r\n      That the thief, though ne'er so sly,\r\n    With his flesh-hooks, don't come nigh,\r\n                              To catch it\r\n\r\n    From him, who all alone sits there,\r\n    Having his eyes still in his ear,\r\n    And a deal of mighty fear,\r\n                          To watch it.'\r\n\r\nMr King makes this interesting note on it: 'This custom, so far as I\r\nknow, is unnoticed by anyone but Herrick.\r\n\r\n'A solitary watcher,\r\n\r\n    '\"Having his eyes still in his ear,\r\n    And a deal of mighty fear,\"\r\n\r\nguarded the pie through the night before Christmas.\r\n\r\n'The pie represented the manger of Bethlehem, and its contents the wise\r\nmen's offerings. The Devonshire \"Christmas play\" has had a curious fate.\r\nExcept, perhaps, in some of the moorland parishes, it has disappeared at\r\nhome. But the Newfoundland fisheries were long carried on for the most\r\npart by sailors from the neighbourhood of Dartmouth and Tor Bay, and Mr\r\nJukes tells us that the streets of St John's at Christmas-time continue\r\nto exhibit St George, the Turkish Knight, and all their companions, in\r\nfull vigour.'\r\n\r\nThe charm of Herrick's verses on country joys is deepened--to the\r\nfolk-lorist in particular--by remembering that the rustic ceremonies he\r\ncommemorates were probably the usual customs observed at Dean Prior in\r\nhis time. On a hot August evening he may have watched the happy and\r\nexcited children who are described in the poem 'The Hock-Cart, or\r\nHarvest-Home.'\r\n\r\n    'About the cart, hear how the rout\r\n    Of rurall youngling raise the shout.\r\n    Pressing before, some coming after,\r\n    These with a shout, and those with laughter.\r\n    Some blesse the carte, some kisse the sheaves,\r\n    Some prank them up with oaken leaves;\r\n    Some cross the fill-horse, some with great\r\n    Devotion stroake the home-borne wheat.'\r\n\r\nAnd many lines point to his acquaintance with all kinds of village\r\nfestivals, as, for instance, those which he addresses to 'Master\r\nEndymion Porter.'\r\n\r\n    'Thy wakes, thy quintels, here them hast,\r\n    Thy May-poles too, with garlands grac't,\r\n    Thy morris-dance, thy Whitsun-ale,\r\n    Thy sheering feast, which never faile,\r\n    Thy harvest home, thy wassaile bowle,\r\n    That's tost up after Foxi'th'hole,\r\n    Thy mummeries, thy twelfth-tide kings,\r\n    And quenes, thy Christmas revellings,\r\n    Thy nut-browne mirth, thy russet wit,\r\n    And no man pays too deare for it.'\r\n\r\n('Foxi'th'hole' is a hopping game, in which boys beat each other with\r\ngloves.)\r\n\r\nHerrick was fortunate in having a kind and hospitable neighbour. Sir\r\nEdward Giles was famed for his uprightness and generous disposition, and\r\nwas looked up to by all the neighbourhood. He succeeded to 'a large park\r\nand very handsome house,' whose existence was partly due to the problem\r\nof the unemployed that was perplexing the benevolent more than three\r\nhundred years ago; for John Giles, 'to the honour of his memory ...\r\nbegan building of the house, and setting up the walls about his park, in\r\nthe time of a very great dearth; whereby hundreds of poor men ... were\r\ndaily fed at his table, who else together with their families in\r\nprobability would have perished for want.' Sir Edward succeeded\r\nimmediately to his father, who was 'a good old gentleman,' with a taste\r\nfor small jokes that must have been sometimes a little tedious. The son\r\nhad too 'active and vigorous a spirit' to rest 'within the compass of an\r\nisland, wherefore ... he travelled beyond the seas,' and in the Low\r\nCountries 'trayl'd a pike in her Majesty's service, Queen Elizabeth of\r\nglorious memory.' Having carved for himself a high reputation, he came\r\nto the court of King James, to find that his fame had preceded him, and\r\nhe received the honour of knighthood at the time of the King's\r\ncoronation. This gave the old knight a chance for a little jest, which\r\nhis son must have found rather exasperating. When he came home, his\r\nfather received him with all ceremony, though 'more jocularly than\r\nseriously ... saluted him with his title of Sir Edward Giles at every\r\nword, and by all means would place him above him, as one dignified with\r\nthe more honourable degree; until at length inquiring of him: \"Sir\r\nEdward, pray tell me,\" said the old gentleman, \"who must discharge the\r\nfees and charges of your knighthood and honour?\" Being answered, \"That\r\nhe hoped he would be pleased to do that,\" \"Nay, then,\" says the old\r\ngentleman, \"come down, Sir Edward Giles, and sit beneath me again, if I\r\nam he that must pay for thy honour.\"' One can imagine his beaming\r\nsatisfaction over it all!\r\n\r\nAmong Sir Edward's friends was the 'eminent and pious and learned\r\nDivine,' Dr Barnabas Potter, whom he presented with the living of Dean\r\nPrior. Herrick and his predecessor were indeed a contrast to one\r\nanother, for Dr Potter was 'melancholy, lean, and a hard student.' He\r\nwas afterwards transplanted from his peaceful solitude to Court, where\r\nhe was appointed Chaplain in Ordinary to Prince Charles, and was known\r\nas the Penitential Preacher. Afterwards, when preferred to the bishopric\r\nof Carlisle, 'he was commonly called the Puritanical Bishop, and they\r\nsaid of him in the time of king James, that Organs would blow him out of\r\nthe church, which I do not believe, the rather because he lov'd Vocal\r\nMusic, and could bear his own part therein.' Altogether, he and the\r\nfuture Merry Monarch must have been very congenial companions.\r\n\r\nGoing farther south, and still keeping to the west of the river, the\r\ntraveller comes to Rattery, close to which is Venton House, once owned\r\nby the Gibbses. In the reign of Edward III John Gibbs was chosen to\r\nundertake important work, for he was called to serve on several\r\nCommissions appointed to carry out the King's business in the county.\r\nThe most interesting of these Commissions seems to have been the one\r\nappointed in 1462, for the purpose of collecting ships for the King's\r\nfleet from those ports--the Commissioners to be responsible for\r\nfurnishing them completely, from 'Masters and Mariners' to 'bows and\r\nbowstrings, wheat, beans, and ale.'\r\n\r\nThe members of the family whose doings were the most amusing, though not\r\nthe most to be admired, were William Gibbs and his son Thomas, who were\r\nproceeded against in the Star Chamber by the Chaplain and Curate of\r\nRattre (Rattery) Church. Some manuscript notes very kindly sent to me\r\nby Mr Herbert Gibbs give a good instance of the light-hearted manner in\r\nwhich it was possible to break and make the peace in a country district\r\nabout the year 1517. The Church of Rattery claimed that William Gibbs\r\nowed £21 2s. 8d., and he claimed that the church owed him sixty-three\r\nshillings, and, putting into practice the adage that Possession is nine\r\npoints of the law, he boldly took out of the church 'a yron boxe locked\r\nwith two lockes,' and helped himself to the money. The complainants\r\nbrought their case to be tried before the Bishop of Exeter and several\r\njustices, but Andrew Hillersdon, son-in-law to William Gibbs, was among\r\nthem, with the result that the only penalty imposed was to find surety\r\nfor his good 'aberying' (bearing) of 100 marks. Although this was a very\r\nmild verdict, it infuriated the culprit, whose next step was to shear\r\nthe Church lambs, and carry off '11 youes with their lambs'; and on the\r\nThursday night before the Feast of St. Matthew he, with his son Thomas\r\nand many others, did 'then and there ryottusly assemble theym togeders\r\nto kyll your said orators, leyin awayte,' and the said 'Thomas Gybbys\r\nwith a swarde and a bokeler made a sawte' upon John Hals, ' ... so as\r\nthe said John Hals was in danger of his lyf and toke the church and\r\nchurch yerde for his savegard and kept the same by the space of two\r\nhours.' His enforced vigil had the added bitterness that, according to\r\nthe complainants, he had had no previous quarrel of any kind with his\r\nassailant. But this demonstration was not enough to satisfy the Gibbses,\r\nand the next Sunday they came again to Rattery 'in manner of a new\r\ninsurrection with twenty-three persons and above,' and with such a\r\nfierce aspect that they caused 'great feer and dreed' to their\r\nneighbours, who in alarm of worse to come warned 'your said orators ...\r\nto kepe them absent from their said church and from their divine\r\nservice, and so they dyd.' The complainants now evidently felt that the\r\ntime for definite action on their part had come, and the case was\r\neventually carried before the 'Lord Cardinall, Chancellor of England,'\r\nbut the account of the proceedings does not give his verdict.\r\n\r\nReturning to the river, Dartington Hall, the beautiful home of the\r\nChampernownes, is soon reached. Dartington was originally the gift of\r\nthe Conqueror to William de Falaise, and passed through the hands of the\r\nLords Audley and of John Holland, Duke of Exeter, half-brother of\r\nRichard II, before Sir Arthur Champernowne exchanged for it the lordship\r\nof Polslo, and settled here in the reign of Elizabeth. And now, says\r\nWestcote, 'it glories in the knightly tribe of Champernowne.' Originally\r\nDartington consisted of two large quadrangles, but one has long been in\r\nruins. The most striking feature is the hall, which is seventy feet long\r\nand forty feet wide, and has pointed windows, a huge old fireplace, and\r\na porch with a groined ceiling. This dates from the fourteenth century,\r\nand part of the quadrangle, together with the gateway at the south end,\r\nis early fourteenth-century work.\r\n\r\nThe Champernownes are a very ancient and distinguished family, though\r\nPrince complains that their 'actions and exploits for the greatest part\r\nis devoured by time.' Sir Arthur Champernowne was 'a good soldier and an\r\neminent commander in the Irish wars' of the sixteenth century, and was\r\nconspicuous for his zeal and valour. Prince gives an odd little bit of\r\ngossip about an heiress of this family. He says she was 'a frolic lady,'\r\nand no unusual epithet could be more descriptive; for the lady 'married\r\nWilliam Polglas, within three days after her father's death; and within\r\ntwo days after her husband Polglas's death, she was married again unto\r\nJohn Cergeaux!'\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Queen Elizabeth Mr Henry Champernowne headed one hundred\r\ngentleman volunteers, who, with the Queen's permission, went to help the\r\ncause of the 'Protestant Princes' in France; and it is interesting to\r\nlearn that Sir Walter Raleigh, then seventeen years old, was one of this\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nThe Champernownes of Dartington were, however, only a younger branch of\r\nthe family. The elder branch lived 'in great splendour' at Modbury. A\r\nstory is told about them of which, perhaps, the most accurate version\r\nmay be found in Britton and Brayley's 'Beauties of England and Wales':\r\n'Tradition speaks very highly ... of the magnificent manner in which the\r\nChampernownes lived, and particularly of their keeping a very fine band\r\nof singers and musicians, which band, if report may be credited, was\r\nthe occasion of the family's ruin, \"for that Mr Champernowne taking it\r\non the Thames in the time of Queen Elizabeth, her Majesty was so\r\ndelighted with the music, that she requested the loan of it for a month;\r\nto which Mr Champernowne, aware of the improbability of its ever\r\nreturning, would not consent, saying that he 'hoped her Majesty would\r\nallow him to keep his fancy.' The Queen was so highly exasperated at\r\nthis refusal, that she found some pretence to sue him at law, and ruin\r\nhim, by obliging him, in the course of the proceedings, to sell no fewer\r\nthan nineteen manors.\" This anecdote, at least the circumstance of the\r\nsale of the nineteen manors about the above period, is in a great degree\r\nconfirmed by the title-deeds of some lands in and about Modbury.'\r\n\r\nA very short distance to the south lies the ancient and very picturesque\r\ntown of Totnes, in which, from the round Norman keep at its crown, to\r\nthe river winding round the foot of the hill, witnesses to the past are\r\njostling against tokens of the present time.\r\n\r\nWhen Leland journeyed through it, the town already gave the idea of\r\nhaving passed its meridian, and his words are clear and concise: 'The\r\nCastelle of _Totnes_ standith on the hille North West of the Towne. The\r\nCastell waulis and the stronge Dungeon be maintained. The Loggingis of\r\nthe Castelle be clene in Ruine.'\r\n\r\nThe early chroniclers go back gloriously into the dim mists of antiquity\r\nfor the origin of Totnes, and when no carping critics insisted on\r\nanalyzing popular history and distilling all the romance out of it, the\r\nstory of the town was very fine indeed. The founder of Totnes, then, was\r\nBrutus of Troy, who after long wanderings arrived in this charming bit\r\nof country, and on this hill made the great announcement:\r\n\r\n    'Here I stand, and here I rest,\r\n    And this place shall be called Totnes.'\r\n\r\nMoreover, the stone that he stepped ashore upon is still here, and the\r\nMayor stands on it whenever it is his duty to proclaim a new Sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe claims of Totnes have been set forth with no undue modesty. 'It hath\r\nflourished, and felt also the storms of affliction, under Britons,\r\nRomans, Saxons, and Normans. To speak somewhat of the antiquity thereof,\r\nI hope I shall take no great pains to prove it (and that without\r\nopposition) the prime town of Great Britain.' Its history is taken in\r\ngrand strides. Having explained that the coming of Brutus was held by\r\nsome to be contemporary with the rule of Eli as high-priest in Israel,\r\nthe writer continues: 'The first conqueror Brutus gave this town and the\r\ntwo provinces, Devon and Cornwall, then but one, to his cousin and great\r\nassistant, Corinoeus, as is well known; whereof the western part is\r\n(as they say) called Cornwall; who peopled it with his own regiment; and\r\nbeing an excellent wrestler, as you have heard, trained his following in\r\nthe same exercises; whereof it comes that the western men in that sport\r\nwin the mastery and game wheresoever they come.... The second conqueror,\r\nWilliam of Normandy, bestowed this town, together with Dartmouth and\r\nBarnstaple, on a worthy man named Judæel.'\r\n\r\nThe space of time between the first and second 'conquerors' does not\r\nseem to strike the historian as a rather wide gap, and the doings of the\r\none and the other are related with almost equal confidence and with the\r\nsame air of authority.\r\n\r\nJudhael de Totnes is supposed to have built the castle, and although\r\nonly the walls of the round keep now remain, the trouble of the long\r\nclimb up to it is well repaid by the lovely view that is gained from the\r\nruin. Fertility and abundance seem to be the characteristics of the\r\nland, and the ridiculous suggestion that the town's name has been\r\ncorrupted from _Toute-à-l'aise_ is one shade less absurd, because that\r\ntitle would be so very appropriate. Here and there a silver gleam shows\r\nwhere the river runs between heavily wooded banks. To the east a green\r\nand smiling country of gentle hills and valleys leads to that shade of\r\npast splendour, the Castle of Berry Pomeroy; and far away to the\r\nnorth-west, it is possible to see the high, sharp tors on Dartmoor.\r\nLooking straight down, the uneven roofs seem tumbled over one another in\r\na way that suggests that different ages have casually showered them into\r\nthe little town.\r\n\r\nTotnes received its first charter from King John, and there are few\r\nolder boroughs in the country. Originally a walled town, Fore Street is\r\nstill crossed by the East Gate, which has been rebuilt in comparatively\r\nmodern times. Within is a room decorated by an early Renaissance frieze\r\nand 'linen-pattern' panelling. The upper stories of some of the old\r\nhouses project over the lower ones, and in the High Street they jut\r\nquite across the pavements, and rest upon columns, making piazzas or\r\ncovered ways along the street. Such piazzas are very uncommon in\r\nEngland, but there is a short one, called the Butter Walk, at Dartmouth.\r\n\r\nThe church is a very fine Perpendicular building, of a warm rose colour,\r\nand it has a high battlemented tower from which three figures look out\r\nof their niches. Some very grotesque gargoyles peer down from the roof\r\nat intervals. The great treasure of the church is its screen, carved so\r\nfinely that the pattern seems like lacework, and it is difficult to\r\nrealize that it can be of stone. The main lines of the carving curve and\r\nspread upwards almost like the lines of palm-leaves, and the screen is\r\ncoloured and gilded. There is another beautiful and delicate, though\r\nless elaborate, bit of carving which divides a little chapel from the\r\nsouth side of the chancel. Under the tower arch is a curious monument to\r\nChristopher Blackhall, who died in 1635, and his four wives, who are\r\nkneeling one behind the other. The dates of their deaths are very\r\nclearly marked by the different fashions of their dresses--a compact and\r\nupstanding ruff adds to the stiff precision of the first wife's\r\nappearance; while the sloping lines of a 'Vandyke' collar embellish the\r\ndress of the fourth.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of the church stands the old Guildhall, and in front\r\nof it another tiny piazza, bordered by granite pillars. Inside\r\n'linen-pattern' panelling lines the walls; there are carved seats all\r\nround the upper end, and in the council-chamber beyond are some\r\nfragments of fine moulding.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the town, a curious custom practised in the eighteenth\r\ncentury must be mentioned--that of taking dogs to help in catching\r\nsalmon. Defoe came here in his travels in the West, and saw the fish\r\nbeing caught. The fish, he says, in the flowing tide swim into a 'cut,\r\nor channel,' which has a 'grating of wood, the cross-bars of which ...\r\nstand pointing inward towards one another.... We were carried thither at\r\nlow water, where we saw about fifty or sixty small salmon, about\r\nseventeen to twenty inches long, which the country people call\r\nsalmon-peel,' caught by putting in a net at the end of a pole. 'The net\r\nbeing fixed at one end of the place, they put in a dog (who was taught\r\nhis trade beforehand) at the other end of the place, and he drives all\r\nthe fish into the net, so that, only holding the net still in its place,\r\nthe man took up two or three and thirty salmon-peel at the first time.'\r\nHe finishes the story by saying that they bought some for dinner at\r\ntwopence apiece. 'And for such fish, not at all bigger, and not so\r\nfresh, I have seen six and sixpence each given at a London fish-market.'\r\n\r\nThe river leaves Totnes in broad, sweeping curves between the hills, and\r\nrolls on past the lovely woods of Sharpham, and on its course to\r\nDartmouth passes the early homes of two men who each played a part in\r\nEnglish history. At Sandridge, close to the river, lived Captain John\r\nDavies, or Davis, whose name is familiar as the discoverer of Davis's\r\nStraits. Prince, who himself lived not far away, takes the fascination\r\nof Dartmouth, and the longing for the sea that Dartmouth seemed to\r\ninspire, as quite natural, and says casually that, living so near this\r\ntown, 'Mr Davis had ... a kind of invitation, to put himself early to\r\nsea.'\r\n\r\nThese were in the days when the Merchant Adventurers were at the height\r\nof their importance and prosperity, and it was in the hope of opening up\r\na trade for the woollen goods of the West-country with India and China\r\nthat Captain Davis set out to look for the North-West Passage.\r\n\r\nTo face all the hazards of this journey, so very far away from\r\ncivilization, and the perils and shocks that might await him in the\r\nfrozen North, he fitted out a little fleet which consisted of the 'Barke\r\n_Sunneshine_, of London, fifty tunnes, and the _Moonshine_, of\r\nDartmouth, thirty-five tunnes, the ship _Mermayd_, of a hundred and\r\ntwenty tunnes, and a pinesse of tenne tunnes named the _North\r\nStarre_.'[5] But in spite of this name of good augury the little\r\npinnace never came home again, and one can only admire with awe the\r\ndaring that ventured to sail a boat of ten tons across the boisterous\r\nAtlantic into the unknown Arctic Seas. Traces of Davis's wanderings\r\nalong the coasts of North America may still be found in the names he\r\nbestowed on different points. 'On sighting first the land, he named the\r\nbay which he entered after his friend, Gilbert Sound; we find also\r\nExeter Sound, Totnes Roads, Mount Raleigh, and other familiar titles. A\r\nfew years later John Davis found the right course to India and China,\r\nand introduced the trade from this country which exists to the present\r\ntime.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: 'An Elizabethan Guild of the City of Exeter,' by William\r\nCotton.]\r\n\r\nA greater man than Davis lived farther down the river at Greenaway,\r\nopposite the pretty village of Dittisham, which, with its strip of beach\r\nand ferry, looks as if it had been 'made for a picture.' Sir Humphrey\r\nGilbert, stepbrother to Sir Walter Raleigh, was a great man to whom\r\nFortune was not overkind, but his 'virtues and pious intentions may be\r\nread ... shining too gloriously to be dusked by misfortune.' His aims\r\nwere higher than the hopes that stirred most of his contemporaries, and\r\nof his 'noble enterprizes the great design ... was to discover the\r\nremote countries of America, and to bring off those savages from their\r\ndiabolical superstitions, to the embracing the gospel.' He made two\r\nefforts to graft a colony with little success, but his third effort was\r\nrather happier; and having left Devonshire in June, 1583, he 'sailed to\r\nNewfoundland and the great river of St Laurence in Canada; which he took\r\npossession of, and seized the same to the crown of England, and invested\r\nthe Queen in an estate for two hundred leagues in length by cutting a\r\nturf and rod after the antient custom of England.' From the developments\r\nof that great country that are now taking place, it cannot but be\r\ninteresting to look back along the vista of years to this very simple\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\nLater this group of emigrants lost heart, and nearly all returned to\r\nEngland, and possibly Sir Humphrey may have wondered whether this\r\nventure also would have but a flickering existence, and would leave no\r\nlasting result of the work on which he had spent his years and his\r\nstrength and his riches. Or it may be that no doubts troubled him, for\r\nhe had a 'noble and gallant spirit,' and his dauntless motto was 'Quid\r\nnon?' The story of his death makes an appropriate ending to his life. He\r\nwas with his colony in Newfoundland when 'necessaries began to fail,'\r\nand he was urged to return home. He started in the _Squirrel_, a ship of\r\nten tons. When they were far out at sea a violent tempest blew up, and\r\nthose in the _Golden Hind_ (a larger ship accompanying them) saw with\r\nhorror the imminent danger that their friends were in. But Sir Humphrey\r\nwas quite composed, and those in the _Golden Hind_ were near enough to\r\nhear him cry 'aloud to his company, in these words: \"We are so near to\r\nheaven here at sea as at land.\"' In the height of the storm the little\r\nboat was swallowed up by the waves, and all on board perished.\r\n\r\nA portrait of Sir Humphrey hung in his grand-nephew's house at Compton,\r\nwhere Prince saw it. 'The one hand holdeth a general's truncheon, and\r\nthe other is laid on the globe of the world, Virginia is written over;\r\non his breast hangs the golden anchor, with the pearl at the peak; and\r\nunderneath are these verses, which, tho' none of the best, may here\r\nsupply the place of an epitaph:\r\n\r\n    '\"Here you may see the portrait of his face,\r\n    Who for his country's honor oft did trace\r\n    Along the deep; and made a noble way\r\n    Unto the growing fame, Virginia.\r\n    The picture of his mind, if ye do crave it,\r\n    Look upon Virtue's picture, and ye have it.\"'\r\n\r\nThe 'golden anchor' was a jewel which the Queen had given him as a\r\nspecial mark of favour, for she looked on him very graciously, in spite\r\nof the fact that his efforts did not then seem as if they would be\r\ncrowned with success. A song was made about the year 1581, in which he\r\nand Sir Francis Drake divide the honours.\r\n\r\n    '_Sir Francis, Sir Francis, Sir Francis_ is come,\r\n    _Sir William_, and eke _Sir Robert_, his son,\r\n    And eke the good Earl of _Southampton_\r\n    Marcht on his way most gallantly on;\r\n\r\n    Then came my Lord Chamberlain, with his white staff,\r\n    And all the people begun for to laugh.\r\n    And then the Queen begun to speak,\r\n    \"You're welcome home, Sir Francis Drake!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n'THE QUEEN'S SPEECH.\r\n\r\n    '\"Gallants all of British blood,\r\n    Why do ye not sail in th' ocean flood?\r\n    I protest ye are not all worth a Philberd\r\n    Compared with Sir Humphrey _Gilberd_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n'THE QUEEN'S REASON.\r\n\r\n[_Probably added in 1584-85._]\r\n\r\n    'For he walkt forth a rainy day,\r\n    To the _Now-Found-land_ he took his way,\r\n    With many a gallant fresh and green.\r\n    He never came home again,\r\n             God bless the Queen!'\r\n\r\nNotes to this song explain: 'We understand as the three-fold holders of\r\nthe name, \"Sir Francis,\" three persons; Sir Francis Drake, Knighted by\r\nthe Queen after his return from circumnavigating the world in 1580: Sir\r\nFrancis Walsingham, and Sir Francis Vere. Sir William Cecil, Lord\r\nBurleigh, and his son, Sir Robert.... The Lord Chamberlain probably\r\nmeant the despicable Sir James Crofts, who hated and calumniated Drake.'\r\n\r\nThe song probably reflects the temper of the time.\r\n\r\n    'They never came back agen.\r\n               God bless the Queen.'\r\n\r\nThe lines are very characteristic of the spirit of the age that was\r\nbound to conquer. There was sorrow for those who were gone, but no\r\ncomplaint, no grudging those who had perished where the fame or power of\r\nthe Queen could be furthered. Gloriana's subjects found no price too\r\ngreat, no sacrifice worth counting; a leader might fall, but the great\r\nscheme must go on, her rule spread farther and wider, and the hazards\r\nand failures overstepped.\r\n\r\nAlthough upon all parts of the South Hams there hovers a spell that is\r\ninexplicable, perhaps it is felt more in Dartmouth than in any other\r\nplace one can think of. Possibly it is the loveliness of sea and land,\r\nflowers in the crevices of the cliffs hanging low towards the water's\r\nedge, the round tower rising out of the sea, the picturesqueness of the\r\ntown, with its thronging associations, or just the intangible influences\r\nof bygone days. But there is something of enchantment about the tower,\r\nespecially when it is contemplated from the water. And to fully\r\nappreciate the whole, one should slip out of the harbour past the Mew\r\nStone, where the sea-gulls rise like a drift of snowflakes on a sudden\r\ngust, into the midst of sliding walls of transparent green water beyond,\r\nwhere--if there is wind enough--glassy hillocks all round, at moments,\r\nhide everything else from sight. Besides the fascination of watching\r\nwaves towering above the boat, and following it as if they would fall\r\nover and bury it in their depths, and climbing them, with the sudden\r\nplunge into the hollow beyond, it may be, especially if shoals of\r\nmackerel are near, that one may have the pleasure of coming upon a flock\r\nof gulls, swimming, swooping, flapping about, and all busy fishing. Or\r\nperhaps there will be a group of brown divers, floating placidly on the\r\nwaves, and then suddenly disappearing, one or two at a time or several\r\nin a moment. And possibly a great black creature may appear a little way\r\noff, tossing and seeming to turn somersaults in the water, and another\r\nand another, and one may find oneself among a school of porpoises, and\r\nhear the curious puffing sounds they make that are not quite like\r\nanything else. From a little distance out, looking back across the\r\nchanging lights that glance over the water, one gets a quite fresh view\r\nof the harbour's mouth, shut in by its high cliffs, half veiled by soft\r\nmasses of green.\r\n\r\nDartmouth had a great stake in the country's welfare in early days, and\r\nwas a port of much stir and traffic. From here sailed many of the ships\r\nthat Richard I gathered together to take the English who were going with\r\nhim on the Third Crusade. William Rufus started once from this harbour\r\nwhen there was trouble in Normandy, and King John paid the town two\r\nvisits. In Edward III's time Dartmouth had already become renowned for\r\nher shipping and sent six ships for the King's service in a fight in\r\nwhich engaged the combined French, Flemish, and Genoese fleets; and she\r\nsent two more a few years later to help in his war against Scotland.\r\nFifty years later this loan was entirely eclipsed by the magnificence of\r\ncontributing no fewer than thirty-one ships to the siege of Calais.\r\n\r\nChaucer's words have often been quoted:\r\n\r\n    'A schipman was ther; wonyng far by weste,\r\n    For ought I woot, he was of Dertemouth.'\r\n\r\nAs if it were more likely that a typical seaman would come from\r\nDartmouth than anywhere else! In no harbour could that great\r\ntraining-ship the _Britannia_ have been more appropriately moored, nor\r\ncould a more fitting place be chosen for the long range of buildings on\r\nthe hill above, the Naval College that has superseded it. Risdon tells\r\nus that the town has been 'sundry times subject to the attacks of\r\nforeigners,' and particularly mentions one occasion in the reign of\r\nHenry III, when the French made such a furious onslaught, that the women\r\nturned out by the side of their menkind and hurled flints at the enemy.\r\nThese found themselves 'courageously resisted by the towns-men\r\nand-women, Amazonian-like.'\r\n\r\nIn 1470 Dartmouth was a step in the retreat of Warwick, 'the\r\nKing-maker,' when Edward IV pursued him as far as Exeter. Warwick\r\nembarked here for France, and his arrival in those unsettled times must\r\nhave created much bustle and excitement amongst all the gossips of the\r\nplace. The Earl was 'in danger of being surprized, whereupon leisurely\r\n(for his great spirit disdained anything that should look like a Flight)\r\nhe retired to _Exeter_, where having dismissed the Remainder of the\r\ntroops that attended him, he went to _Dartmouth_, and there, with many\r\nladies in his company and a large Retinue, he took ship and sailed\r\ndirectly to Calais.'\r\n\r\nAmongst the celebrities of Dartmouth is a certain John Hawley, a great\r\nmerchant of immense wealth. A couplet ran of him:\r\n\r\n    'Blow the wind high, or blow the wind low,\r\n    It bloweth still to Hawley's hawe'\r\n\r\n--that is, to his house. Prince interprets this by saying that Hawley\r\nhad so many ships all over the world that any wind that blew was of\r\nadvantage to some of them.\r\n\r\nWhen Leland came here, he remarked on the great ruins of 'Hawley's Haul\r\n... a rich merchant and a noble warrior against the _French_ Men.'\r\nHawley is buried in the beautiful church of St Saviour's, and a large\r\nbrass represents him as lying between his two wives.\r\n\r\nIn this church is a most delicately carved screen, and leaves, sprays,\r\nand grapes are conspicuous amongst the details of its graceful design.\r\nThe groined cornice is decorated by exquisite fan-tracery, and various\r\nsaints and 'doctors of the church' are painted on the panels of the\r\nlower part. In the high carved stone pulpit are tabernacled recesses,\r\nonce enclosing figures, but now containing 'royal badges and devices';\r\nand both screen and pulpit were coloured and gilded, and are rather\r\ndimmed by time. The church has many very interesting features, and in\r\nthe south porch is a most curious wrought-iron door, showing a tree with\r\nlong, drooping branches and large diamond-shaped leaves, and two\r\nwonderful heraldic lions impaled on it.\r\n\r\nThe Castle was built in the time of Henry VII, on the site of an older\r\none; for when Edward IV reigned, the men of Dartmouth built themselves a\r\ncastle at the desire of the King, who promised that if they would by\r\nthis means protect the town--and, further, would guard the harbour by\r\nputting a chain across the mouth--they should have £30 yearly from the\r\ncustoms of Dartmouth and Exeter. The chain stretched across to\r\nKingswear, and a hollow in the rock by the ruins of an old guard-house\r\nshows where it once passed. The little square castle of Kingswear stands\r\nclose by, and from certain points of view both Kingswear and the\r\nbeautiful round tower of Dartmouth Castle seem to be rising straight out\r\nof the waves.\r\n\r\nIn 1685 an agreement very much like the earlier one was made. James II\r\nhad some cause for uneasiness and for looking closely to his defences,\r\nand, as it happened, three years later there landed, only a few miles\r\naway, the man who, superseding him, was hailed by the majority as\r\nEngland's Deliverer. But when James came to the throne he had already\r\nseen Dartmouth conquered by an enemy's troops; for, although Prince\r\nMaurice had secured it in the earlier stages of the war, Fairfax had\r\ntaken it later. Among the Duke of Somerset's papers are some orders\r\ngiven by a Council of War, at which 'Colonel Edward Seymour, Governor of\r\nDartmouth town and garrison,' was present, providing very minutely for\r\nthe defence of the town and for the supplies of the garrison. Stories of\r\nthe Parliamentary troops quartering themselves in churches are sometimes\r\ntold, with the unfair implication that they alone were guilty of such\r\ndesecration; for where need was urgent the Royalists took the same\r\ncourse. Here we find orders: 'Captain Haughton ... with forty men shall\r\nlie in Townstall church, for the fortifying thereof against the enemy,\r\nand that the said captain, his officers and company, shall have their\r\nvictuals from Mount Boone.' Also that a 'month's provision of victuals\r\nbe laid into St Petrox church for five hundred men, and the said Major\r\nTorner and his select officers shall be keepers thereof.' The Church of\r\nSt Clement at Townstall was fortified with ten cannon.\r\n\r\nFairfax attacked in the first days of January, 1646, in exceptionally\r\ncold weather. Honourable conditions of surrender had been first offered\r\nto the Governor, but were refused, and he prepared to fight to the end.\r\n'In extreme bitter cold weather and snow' the Parliamentary forces moved\r\nforward, and, after examining the town as closely as they could, decided\r\nto take it by storm. Additional troops were ordered up to strengthen the\r\nbesiegers, and Sir Thomas Fairfax sent for a squadron to prevent any\r\nhelp reaching the Royalists by sea. On Sunday evening 'the soldiers were\r\nall drawn out; about seven at night forlorn hopes were set, the evening\r\nvery mild, as at midsummer, the frost being newly gone; the word was\r\ngiven: _God with us_.... About 11 o'clock at night the storm began.'\r\n\r\nThree separate attacks were made simultaneously on different parts of\r\nthe town, and though the besieged fought bravely, they fought in vain,\r\nand by the next morning all but the Castle and the little fort above\r\nwere in the hands of the enemy. Sir Hugh Pollard, the Governor (Sir\r\nEdward Seymour was at this time taking part in the defence of Exeter),\r\nhad been wounded the night before, and, realizing that his position was\r\nhopeless, 'after some dispute, 'he surrendered on Fairfax's terms, and\r\nyielded himself and his officers prisoners, the common soldiers being\r\nset at liberty to repair to their dwellings.'\r\n\r\nThe fort above Kingswear, commanded by Sir Henry Cary, was protected by\r\nstrong bulwarks, and the defence being very well carried out, the\r\ngarrison obtained better terms. 'To save time,' writes Fairfax to the\r\nHouse of Peers, 'I willingly condescended to let Sir Henry Cary march\r\naway with the rest, leaving the arms, ordnance, ammunition, with all\r\nprovisions.'\r\n\r\nThis was all accomplished on the Monday, and on the evening following\r\nthe attack the Parliament was in full possession of the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nKingsbridge, Salcombe, and the South Hams\r\n\r\n    'On the ninth day of November, at the dawning in the sky,\r\n    Ere we sailed away to New York, we at anchor here did lie;\r\n    O'er the meadows fair of Kingsbridge, then the mist was lying grey;\r\n    We were bound against the rebels, in the _North America_.\r\n    O, so mournful was the parting of the soldiers and their wives,\r\n    For that none could say for certain they'd return home with their\r\n      lives.\r\n    Then the women they were weeping, and they curs'd the cruel day\r\n    That we sailed against the rebels, in the _North America_.'\r\n\r\n    _Farewell to Kingsbridge._\r\n\r\nKingsbridge lies in a fold of the hills that rise beyond the head of the\r\ncreek running inland from Salcombe Harbour, and seen from the water it\r\nis very picturesque--the houses clustered together and clinging to the\r\nslope, and the spire of St Edmund's Church standing out against the\r\nstill, green background. Mr Mason has written of 'the mists on the\r\nhills, and the gulls crying along the valley,' by Kingsbridge, and this\r\nexactly sums up its individuality. It has the peculiar atmosphere of a\r\nsea-town, but why, precisely, it is difficult to say.\r\n\r\nThe Fore Street is steep and winding, and on one side stands a church\r\nwhich, without any very striking feature, is quietly impressive. It is a\r\ncruciform building, and a steeple rises from the centre. A chapel,\r\ndedicated to St Edmund, King and Martyr, stood on this spot before the\r\nyear 1250; but it was rebuilt and aisles were added by the Abbot and\r\nmonks of Buckfast in the beginning of the fifteenth century. In the\r\nsouth transept of the present church are remains of early English work,\r\nand the font is Early English. Hagioscopes slant through the chancel\r\nwalls from the aisle on either side. The very unusual name of a\r\nbenefactress must be noticed--Tryphena Tobys.\r\n\r\nDodbrooke is joined so closely to Kingsbridge that their streets run\r\ninto each other, and they are separated only by small streams now partly\r\ncovered in. It would be almost impossible for a stranger wandering about\r\nto say offhand which town he was in. Dodbrooke is really the older of\r\nthe two. A grant to hold a market was made to Alan Fitz-Roald, in or\r\npossibly just before the year 1256. About this time a serious quarrel\r\noccurred, when 'Henry Fitz-Alan impleaded Matthew Fitz-John, with forty\r\nothers, for throwing down a pillory in Dodbrooke. Forty seems a good\r\nmany against the pillory! But the affair was not one of those cases in\r\nwhich a spark causes a fire, but was rather an outburst of flame in a\r\nlong-smouldering feud between the Fitz-Alans and the Lords of Stokenham\r\nover the manor of Dodbrooke. In the end, the Fitz-Alans triumphed.\r\n\r\nThree hundred years later we find the people of Dodbrooke complaining of\r\nthe heavy contributions that they were called on to make towards\r\nfurnishing 'ships of war'; for after the Armada had been defeated the\r\nmeans of defence on these coasts were for some years kept up to a very\r\nhigh standard. Mr Richard Champernowne,--who, it must be admitted, from\r\nthe general tenor of his ways, seems to have been one of those\r\nwell-meaning but egotistical and meddlesome people who are always being\r\nsurprised and hurt because their good offices are not better\r\nreceived,--wrote to the local authorities as follows:\r\n\r\n'Cousin Cary, and the rest of the Commissioners for the ship causes, I\r\nhave received some grievous complaints of some poor men who are taxed in\r\nDodbrook to this, more than all their goods are worth.... Surely, as the\r\ncountry must bitterly speak against those [who] are procurors and\r\nassistants in this country, so would it be as highly disliked both of\r\nher Majesty as of the Lords, if they knew rightly of whom, and on what\r\nsort, this tax is levied.'\r\n\r\nBut, alas! a severe snub was the result of this appeal, and the unhappy\r\nMr Cary must have deeply regretted that he had obligingly forwarded the\r\ngrievance to the Lords of the Council.\r\n\r\nTheir answer ran: 'The Court.... The Council to George Carey, J.P....'\r\nThey learn by his late letter that the county is unwilling to contribute\r\nthe charges imposed upon it for 'setting out ships etc.' It is paid\r\ncheerfully by other counties, and he is desired to return the names of\r\nthose persons who are obstinate in refusing payment.\r\n\r\nThere is no building of special interest excepting the church, which is\r\ndedicated to St Thomas à Becket. The arches dividing the aisles from the\r\nnave are high and rather pointed, giving an impression of loftiness.\r\nThere is a beautiful carved screen, with painted figures on the panels;\r\nand the font is a very early one. Of the infants baptized in it, one at\r\nleast obtained a rather unenviable celebrity--Dr John Wolcot, better\r\nknown as 'Peter Pindar.' His bitter satires earned for him a harvest of\r\nhatred and abuse, but nobody denied his wit. 'There is a pretty story of\r\nthe older Pindar that a swarm of bees lighted on his cradle in his\r\ninfancy and left honey on his lips; but we fear in the case of our hero\r\nthey were wasps that came, and that they left some of the caustic venom\r\nof their stings.' A surgeon's son, he studied medicine himself, but was\r\nunpopular with his patients for the reason that his ideas were too far\r\nahead of his time. His opinion that 'a physician can do little more than\r\nwatch Dame Nature, and give her a shove in the back when he sees her\r\ninclined to do right,' was considered a shocking heresy, and, no doubt,\r\na confession of his own ignorance.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Dodbrooke, mention must be made of the 'white ale'\r\npeculiar to the place--a compound of malt, hops, and flour, fermented\r\nwith an ingredient called 'grout.' Some of the statements about this ale\r\nshow the curious tendency of traditions to transfer themselves from\r\npoints in the nebulous past to points that are just beyond the range of\r\nliving memory. It is difficult to discover when 'white ale' was first\r\nmade, but the general idea is that it was invented a very long time ago,\r\nthough personally I have not been able to find any indisputable\r\nreference to it earlier than in the edition of Camden's 'Britannia'\r\npublished in 1720, where there is a brief notice that the people of\r\nDodbrooke pay tithes in white ale to the Rector. A will dated 1528,\r\nhowever, gives directions in regard to a gift that was to include\r\n'cakes, wine, and ale,' and it has been supposed that the particular\r\nkind made in this town would be the ale here referred to. Yet I was told\r\nby an inhabitant of the neighbourhood who was a good deal interested in\r\nlocal traditions, that it was introduced by the French doctor of the\r\nprisoners of war at Kingsbridge Barracks, for the benefit of those who\r\nfound themselves ill at ease in this climate--an event that could not\r\npossibly have taken place till the very end of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThere is a charm over all this country, not solely due to its beauty. It\r\nis true that it is rather drowsy, that the 'spell of the briar-rose' in\r\npart lies over it, but it may be that this adds to the charm. There is\r\nan absence of competition, an air of plenty and of kindness, a golden\r\nglamour that gives the impression that Nature has told the people theirs\r\nis a generous portion, and they may sit still and be content. And they\r\nare content.\r\n\r\nThere is such an overbrimming wealth of bushes and plants and flowers on\r\nevery side, that the fact of the water in the estuary being salt\r\nscarcely seems to prevent their growing in it! Along the bank washed by\r\nthe flowing tide, and almost touching the masses of tough golden-brown\r\nseaweed on the rocks, are multitudes of the daisy-flowers of\r\nsea-mayweed, flowering samphire, the stars of sow-thistle, and bright\r\nyellow bunches of charlock and straggling spires of wild-mignonette,\r\nagainst a darker background of blackthorn, hawthorn, ivy, and furze,\r\nlightly powdered with trails of bramble-blossom. Creeks, edged with low\r\nhills, wind away from the estuary. When the tide is low, great stretches\r\nof mud and sand lie on either side, and here may be seen black\r\ncormorants and crowds and crowds of gulls, here and there a heron, and\r\nquantities of smaller birds. The scene changes entirely at the mouth of\r\nthe creek, for here the banks rise into high rugged cliffs, and the\r\nwater frets restlessly over sunken rocks.\r\n\r\nSalcombe is a tiny little town, with steep, narrow streets and\r\nhigh-walled gardens on each side of the close lane that ends the\r\nprincipal street; and between the gardens the air is fragrant with sweet\r\nclematis, that, as well as red valerian, tumbles in clusters over the\r\nwalls. Salcombe has a very good claim to remembrance, for on a\r\npeninsular rock at the mouth of the harbour stand the ruins of a\r\nfortress that held out for King Charles later than any other place in\r\nDevonshire. It was defended by Sir Edward Fortescue, and surrendered\r\nonly on May 7, 1646.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the estuary, high on the cliffs, lies the small\r\nvillage of Portlemouth. The cross-shaped church is dedicated to a Celtic\r\nsaint, St Winwaloe, locally called St Onolaus. A proverb without much\r\npoint (probably only the fragment of a more coherent saying) mentions St\r\nWinwaloe amongst several saints whose days fall on windy dates.\r\n\r\n    'First comes David, next comes Chad,\r\n    And then comes Winneral, as though he were mad,\r\n    White or black,\r\n    On old house thack [thatch].'\r\n\r\n[St David's Day, March 1; St Chad's Day, March 2; St Winwaloe's Day,\r\nMarch 3.]\r\n\r\nIn his church here is a very finely carved screen, and of one of the\r\nfigures on it Mr Baring-Gould tells an amusing story: 'The sixth is Sir\r\nJohn Schorne, a Buckinghamshire rector, who died in 1308, and was\r\nsupposed to have conjured the devil into a boot. He was venerated\r\ngreatly as a patron against ague and the gout. There is a jingle\r\nrelative to him:\r\n\r\n    '\"To Maister John Schorne, that blessed man born,\r\n      For the ague to him we apply,\r\n    Which judgeth with a bote; I beshrew his heart's rote\r\n      That will trust him, and it be I.\"'\r\n\r\nSouth of Portlemouth the land ends in the grand headland of Prawle\r\nPoint, the most southerly point in Devon. Prawle Point is very striking,\r\nand is 'principally composed of gneiss rock, which on the western side\r\nis weathered like a surface of snow which has been exposed to the sun's\r\nrays. It is everywhere broken into crags.' Prawle Point--'Prol in\r\nAnglia'--was known to foreigners for many centuries; and Mr R. J. King,\r\nin an admirable article on Devonshire, says that it 'is mentioned by an\r\nancient commentator on Adam of Bremen's \"Historia Ecclesiastica,\" as\r\none of the stations at which vessels touched on their voyage from Ripa\r\nin Denmark. The passage was made from the \"Sincfala,\" near Bruges, and\r\n\"the station beyond 'Prol'\" is St Matthieu--one day's sail. Adam of\r\nBremen dates about 1070, and his commentator a little later.'[6] St\r\nMatthieu is in Brittany.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: 'Sketches and Studies.']\r\n\r\nTo the south of Salcombe rise the great cliffs of Bolt Head, and a few\r\nmiles farther to the west is Bolt Tail. Mr Norway points out that 'no\r\nother town in South Devon possesses, nor, indeed, more than one or two\r\non any coast, a headland so high and dark and jagged as the entrance to\r\nthe harbour. It is wild and rugged like a Cornish headland, and the walk\r\nacross it to Bolt Tail is the finest between Portland and the Lizard.' A\r\nfew miles to the west is Thurlestone, and all about here the coast is\r\nmost dangerous. A ship flung in a storm towards the shore has no chance\r\non the jagged rocks that spur-like, jut out from the cliffs, and the\r\ntide races inshore with terrific power, even when it is not driven by a\r\nwild south-westerly wind. This part of the coast was naturally a happy\r\nhunting-ground for smugglers, and was not altogether innocent of\r\nwreckers. A fearful wreck that happened in 1772 is still remembered. A\r\nlarge vessel--the _Chantiloupe_, from the West Indies--went ashore in\r\nBigbury Bay. All the passengers but one were drowned, and over the death\r\nof a lady there hangs a terrible doubt. On realizing the desperate\r\nplight of the ship, she had hurriedly dressed herself in her most\r\nbeautiful clothes and jewels, no doubt hoping that, as they were so\r\nclose to land, there was a good chance of escape. She was, indeed,\r\nthrown up on the beach, but, it is to be hoped, already dead, for, with\r\nshocking callousness, the people watching there snatched away all her\r\nvaluables and left her lying there. An account of the wreck, written in\r\n1874, tells that at that date a lady living near the bay still had a\r\ncorner of the victim's apron, a very beautifully embroidered bit of fine\r\nmuslin. The unfortunate passenger's name was never really known, but\r\nrumour has always connected her with Edmund Burke; for it is certain\r\nthat he feared some relatives or friends of his were on that ship, and\r\non hearing of the wreck he came down and investigated the matter of the\r\nlady's death himself. But he could get no information. The account of\r\nthe wreck goes on to quote the views of a man who lived near the spot:\r\n'The old man who seemed to know most about it said: \"The lady _was_\r\na-murdered, he believed; Jan Whiddon's father's dog found this here lady\r\nburied in the sand, he scratched up her hand.\"' The story is quoted at\r\nsome length, and is characteristic of a Devonshire countryman's combined\r\ncaution and sense of fate, for it finished: '\"'Twas never found out who\r\nmurdered her ... but all who were concerned in it, or supposed to be\r\n[the villagers obviously believed three men to be guilty] came to a bad\r\nend.\"'\r\n\r\nIn repeating these stories, I feel rather in fault, for I have listened\r\nto, and been impressed by, the views of a native of these parts, who was\r\nextremely severe on anyone that wrote about wreckers and reflected\r\ndiscredit on this coast, giving the idea that 'we robbed and murdered\r\npeople.' A little to my surprise, he said he liked reading books about\r\nDevonshire, and admired some well-known novels dealing with the county,\r\nthough he thought them quite inaccurate. 'But,' he added tolerantly,\r\n'they say that, to get at the truth from a guide-book, you must divide\r\nwhat you read in three, and then take away half.' He admitted, all the\r\nsame, that there had been a certain amount of wrecking in the days of\r\nthe pirates (smugglers?), and putting lights in the wrong places. When\r\nhe was a boy, what they liked best was a wreck with a 'general' cargo,\r\nso that the men could sell the mineral and the wives could wear the\r\nsilk; but there were fewer wrecks of any kind nowadays. It is very quiet\r\nin the winter (east of Kingsbridge), unless anyone is going to be\r\nburied, and the only other chances of any stir are if there is a wedding\r\nor a christening, or a wreck in Start Bay.\r\n\r\nThurlestone takes its name from a 'thirled' or pierced rock, on the\r\nshore through which the waves have drilled an arch. The rector of\r\nThurlestone has very kindly allowed me to make some extracts from a\r\nmanuscript history of the parish in his possession, the earlier notes of\r\nwhich have been taken from entries made at the time of the events, in\r\nthe Bishop of Exeter's registers, and have, therefore, the value of\r\ncontemporary evidence. They are very interesting, as giving glimpses at\r\nthe course of events in a remote parish through several centuries.\r\n\r\nDuring part of the fourteenth century the parishioners seem to have been\r\nrather turbulent and the history tells of storms. Some while before the\r\nfirst entry, in June, 1328, someone had not only been murdered, but\r\nactually done to death within the church. There is no record of the\r\npunishment of the culprit or culprits, or of any sign of penitence shown\r\nby the parish; but probably some steps had been taken, for at that date\r\nBishop Grandisson commissioned the Archdeacon of Totnes to reconcile the\r\nparish church of Thurlestone, 'which had been polluted by the shedding\r\nof blood therein. For some reason not given the Archdeacon was excused\r\nfrom performing this duty, and Stephen Abbot of Buckfast was\r\ncommissioned to officiate.... On the 8th of the Kalends of August, 1328,\r\nthe Bishop issued his mandate to the Archdeacon of Totnes, informing him\r\nthat the Abbot, having proceeded to Thurlestone, had reconciled the\r\nchurch, and that he was to require the Parishioners to pay the customary\r\ndues within eight days of the serving of this Monition to that effect.'\r\nThe dues, however, were not forthcoming, and on October 6 the Bishop,\r\nwho allowed no insubordination, threatened the defaulters with\r\nexcommunication unless they paid the desired amount within six days.\r\n'This had the desired effect, and on the 20th of October the Bishop sent\r\nto the Rector and the parishioners the formal acquittance. On the same\r\nday, he commissioned Sir Robert de Pynho, the Rector, to absolve the\r\nparishioners and relax the interdict imposed on their Parish Church.'\r\n\r\nAn unpleasant experience of Sir Henry Benet, priest and Canon of the\r\nChurch of Crediton, and Rector of Thurlestone, witnesses to the\r\nlawlessness of the time in East Devon. He was 'peaceably entering the\r\ntown of St Mary [Ottery St Mary] on Tuesday (_tertia feria_) of the then\r\ninstant Pentecost Sunday,' when 'certain unknown persons, sons of\r\nperdition ... under colour of a precept which they falsely asserted they\r\nhad received from the Sheriff of Devon, rushed on Sir Henry and ...\r\nrashly, violently and sacrilegiously laid hands on him and inhumanly\r\nforced him into the public prison for thieves and criminals.' A\r\n'Denuntiation of Excommunication' against these 'sons of perdition' in\r\nBishop Grandisson's register is undated, but it follows an entry made in\r\nMarch, 1349-50.\r\n\r\nA later rector must have been a pleasant acquaintance and a good friend.\r\nThe Rev. John Snell 'was a person of firm and unshaken loyalty,' and\r\nwhen 'Fort-Charles' was about to be besieged, he joined the garrison in\r\norder to give all the help he could to Sir Edward Fortescue. On the\r\nsurrender of the fort, amongst the very honourable conditions that Sir\r\nEdward obtained was the agreement that Mr Snell 'should be allowed the\r\nquiet possession of his Parsonage; but Articles, like oaths, in those\r\ndays, were only matter of Form, and accordingly (about the year 1646) he\r\nwas soon after plundered of his cattle and other goods without-doors,\r\nand several times forced to fly for his life.' Later, his lot was made\r\nstill harder by the confiscation of his living, which he did not regain\r\nuntil after the Restoration. In the old parish register is a note,\r\nprobably interpolated by John Snell when he had returned to his living,\r\nand with outraged feelings had been looking at the volume, and reading\r\nthe entry referring to the appointment of a lay registrar in his parish.\r\nThe registrars elected in 1653 were not only given charge of the parish\r\nregisters, but took another office out of the hands of the clergy. No\r\nmarriage might take place without the registrar's certificate that he\r\nhad called the banns. The couple then took the certificate to the\r\nnearest magistrate, who, after hearing each of them repeat a brief\r\nformula, was authorized to declare them legally married.\r\n\r\nMr Snell's exclamation of distress appears under a notice which\r\n'certyfyed John Calder (?) of the parish of Thurelston to bee Register\r\nof the sayde Parish,' and was signed by 'Will Bastard,' and dated\r\n'September 20th, 1653.' Above and below the date is written:\r\n\r\n    'Monstrum horrendum informe.\r\n      [This is y^e Houre and Y^e]\r\n          Anno Dom. 1653.\r\n        [Power of darkness.]'\r\n\r\nOn Mr Snell's tombstone is a long Latin epitaph, from an English version\r\nof which the following lines are taken:\r\n\r\n    'He was the silent storehouse of the poor,\r\n    The dear delight of those who needed nought,\r\n    To all the pattern of a holy life.'\r\n\r\nThe Thurlestone chronicle records a certain number of beliefs and\r\ncharms, and on one of them the present rector makes a note of peculiar\r\ninterest: 'The Bishop of Malborough [Dr Earle, then Vicar of West\r\nAlvington and Malborough] tells me that his curate, the Rev. Robert\r\nHole, South Huish, saw this charm used successfully to stop blood on a\r\nman called James Pierie.\r\n\r\n\r\n'A CURE FOR STAUNCHING BLOOD.\r\n\r\n    'Jesus was born in Bethlehem.\r\n    The water was wild in the wood,\r\n    He spake the word and it stood,\r\n    And so will (--'s --'s) blood,'\r\n\r\n     'In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\r\n     Amen. 'Used by Betty Edgecombe, white witch of Malborough and West\r\n     Alvington.'\r\n\r\nNot far from Thurlestone was another parson who worked hard to embarrass\r\nthe besiegers of the Royalists in Salcombe Castle, and who had his share\r\nof thrilling adventures. Mr Lane was the rector of Aveton Giffard, a\r\nparish at the head of the estuary of the Avon, which opens into Bigbury\r\nBay. When the war broke out he took an active part, in conjunction with\r\nseveral gentlemen in the neighbourhood, in 'raising Succours for his\r\nMajesty.' And at the same time he began to make a 'Fort on a Hill' (part\r\nof the Glebe), which commanded the bridge over the Avon, crossed by\r\nParliamentary troops marching to the siege of the Castle. Meanwhile,\r\nsoldiers from Plymouth came up in boats, plundered the house, and took,\r\nsays Mr Lane's youngest son, 'Two of my brethren, _Richard_ and _John_,\r\nnot giving them time to put on their stockings, and forced them to carry\r\nwhat of the Goods they could to _Awmar_ (a creek), where they carried\r\noff Stolen Sheep and Plundered Goods with my two eldest brothers. When\r\nthe war was ended the triumphant Parliamentarians attempted to revenge\r\nthemselves on their sturdy enemy, and searched the country for 'Bishop\r\n_Lane_, the _Traytor_,' who was driven to hide in his church tower. For\r\nthree or four months his people secretly brought him food, and he was\r\nthen able to make his escape, and in the end reached France in safety.\r\n\r\nIf the traveller returns to Prawle Point, and then follows the coast\r\ntowards Dartmouth, he will soon come to the ridge of Start Point, which\r\n'stretches boldly to sea, sloped on each side like the roof of a house,\r\nand crowned along its entire length by fanciful crags, strangely\r\nweathered and shaggy with moss.' Round the Point at a certain state of\r\nevery tide there is a formidable tide-race, and always a swell so strong\r\nas to make small boats very careful of the weather before they try to\r\nsail round the Start. Dartmouth lies almost due north, and the\r\ncoast-line between is very lovely, though it has not the impressiveness\r\nof the cliffs farther west. Slapton Sands are over two miles long, and\r\nthe hills stand back far enough from the shore to leave room for Slapton\r\nLea, a fresh-water lake, almost smothered with tall, feathery reeds and\r\nrushes in the summer, separated from the sea by a barrier of pebbles.\r\nThe line of these wooded hills is broken by three little valleys, and\r\ndown each one flows a brook that feeds the Lea. At the southern edge is\r\nTor Cross, a handful of cottages under the shadow of a cliff that shuts\r\naway the shore-line to the south. The long stretch of sands is\r\ndelightful. They are dotted all over with the glaucous leaves and\r\nbrilliant flowers of the yellow-horned poppy, and bristling blue viper's\r\nbugloss, and on the inland edge there is a scattered border of the\r\nrest-harrow's pink butterfly blossoms. The short turf beyond is\r\nsprinkled with the little white bladder campion and thrift and many\r\nother flowers.\r\n\r\nAt the northern end of the sands the road turns inland, and presently\r\ncomes to Blackpool, very small, but one of the most perfect of miniature\r\nbays. The cliffs are 'of various colours and very lustrous,' and almost\r\non the brink the road winds its way amongst woods of firs and pines that\r\nseem to breathe out a peculiarly spice-like sweetness. When I saw it\r\nthe sea was like molten silver, for the sunlight poured on it from\r\nbeyond clouds, and the sun itself was not to be seen. But though this\r\nbay looks as if it had fallen from a poet's dream, it has been the scene\r\nof many stern events and disasters; for ships have mistaken the inlet\r\nfor Dartmouth Harbour, with lamentable results. Many a time, too, it has\r\nbeen used by those who knew the coast well, but had their own reasons\r\nfor wishing to land without attracting notice, for it is quite cut off\r\nby the shoulder of the hill from Dartmouth, and is near no other town.\r\n\r\nIn Queen Mary's reign the secret landing of doubtful characters was a\r\ndanger that had to be diligently guarded against, and the Lords of the\r\nCouncil received an agitated letter from Sir John St Leger on this\r\nsubject just after the flight of Sir Peter Carew. Sir Peter had a castle\r\nand many friends at Dartmouth, and Sir John quotes him as often having\r\nsaid that if he were the King's enemy he could take 'Dartmouth Castle'\r\nand 'burne the Towne with fewer than a hundred persons and lett ynto the\r\nhaven suche as pleased hym. I, also, am creadeably informed the way howe\r\nhe should be able to do so. That within a myle, or les, of the said\r\nTowne, there is a very good open place called Black poole, for the\r\nqueene's enemyes to lande, and invade, and from thense may come to the\r\nsaide towne from the back side.'\r\n\r\nBut when Queen Elizabeth came to the throne, and Sir Peter was\r\nreinstated and held in great honour, the coast was still far from safe,\r\nand there is a letter written by the Queen in 1564 to her 'Right Trustie\r\nand wel-beloved' Sir Peter, commissioning him to get ready and arm two\r\nships, that, as the 'cost of Devonshyre and Cornwall is by reput much\r\nharted with pyrattes and Rovers,' so he should repress and, as far as\r\npossible, capture them. Twenty-four years later a far more serious\r\ndanger threatened, and the preparations against the Spanish Armada were\r\nvery elaborate. Masses of the most stringent orders are still preserved\r\namongst the House of Lords manuscripts, and to quote a few will give an\r\nidea of their nature and scope.\r\n\r\nOn July 11, 1588, it was ordered: 'That all persons of what degree\r\nsoever ... whose armour and furniture shall not be found serviceable,\r\nfor the first offence shall be put into the stocks one whole day,\r\npublicly; and for the second offence to the gaol for ten days' etc.\r\nCareful instructions are sent as to the choice of watchmen for the\r\nbeacons and their duties; and a brief note refers to a letter written by\r\nthe Council to Sir Walter Raleigh, then Warden of the Stannaries,\r\ndemanding the muster-rolls of the tinners, both horse and foot, 'who\r\npoured to war' as well from Dartmoor's as from 'Mendip's sunless caves.'\r\n\r\nAfter the Armada had been defeated, there were fears of another Spanish\r\ninvasion, and in January, 1595-96, news came to the Deputy-Lieutenants\r\nand Justices of the Peace of Devon that 'The Queen has found it\r\nconvenient to have her navy and certain companies of Soldiers for\r\nland-service in readiness to be victualled' with all possible speed 'for\r\nher service ... 400 quarters of wheat, 200 oxen, and 200 flitches of\r\nbacon are required from Devonshire.'\r\n\r\nThere are notices, too, respecting such gentlemen as 'have been charged\r\nwith light horses and petronels,' and of the particular divisions of\r\ncoast apportioned to each. For instance, in a certificate dated June 25,\r\n1596, it is stated that 'Mr Seymour's colonelship reacheth from\r\nPlymouth to Dartmouth. Mr Cary's from Dartmouth to Exmouth. Sir Thomas\r\nDennis from Exmouth to Axmouth.' And, going into particulars: 'For\r\nSalcomb, Mr William Courtenay with the assistance of the constable and\r\nother officers there.... Long Sands [Slapton] and Black pool to be\r\ndefended by Mr Ameredith and Mr Roope.' The notice continues to give an\r\nexact list of the places next one another along the coast, the names of\r\nthe officers and numbers of men appointed to defend each.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all that was done, in the summer of 1598 the Lords of the\r\nCouncil were dissatisfied, and wrote to the Lord-Lieutenant to complain\r\nof 'the number of horse, which we think to be very few in that country\r\nin regard to the largeness and wealth of the same.' But the people in\r\nthe county looked at the matter in a different light, and in the\r\nfollowing April, at a meeting in Exeter, it was resolved that a letter\r\nshould be written to the Lords of the Council to convey 'the desire of\r\nthe country' to be freed from a certain 'contribution' wherewith they\r\nfind themselves much burdened and grieved in respect of the manifold\r\nimpositions daily coming upon them.'\r\n\r\nDemands and complaints seem to have been bandied backwards and forwards\r\nfor some time afterwards, for in 1600 there came this brief but alarming\r\nnote from the Lords of the Council:\r\n\r\n'_June 23, Greenwich._--The composition money for Devonshire, though the\r\nwhole amounts but to £113 6s. 8d., remains partly unpaid; we have\r\ntherefore sent down a messenger to bring before us all those who remain\r\nin arrear.'\r\n\r\nFortunately, the period of acute alarm had now passed away, and the\r\ntrain-bands were dismissed, so that the burden of levying contributions\r\nmust for a while have been lightened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nThe Three Towns\r\n\r\n    'Upon the British coast what ship yet ever came,\r\n    That not of Plymouth hears, where those brave navies lie,\r\n    From cannons thund'ring throats that all the world defy?\r\n    Which to invasive spoil, when th' English list to draw,\r\n    Have check'd Iberia's pride, and held her oft in awe:\r\n    Oft furnishing our dames with India's rar'st devices,\r\n    And lent us gold and pearl, rich silks and dainty spices.'\r\n\r\n    DRAYTON: _Poly-olbion_.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Be patient, I beseech you, I am in a labyrinth, where I find many ways\r\nto proceed, but not one to come forth.' Such is Westcote's plea while\r\nattempting to describe Plymouth, and it may be echoed from the heart by\r\nanyone who is in the same perplexing position. The words so exactly sum\r\nup the difficulty. One is bewildered by the multitude of associations\r\nthronging on every side in a town in which, unlike other West Country\r\nports, the pulse of life throbs as strongly as it did in the centuries\r\nlong gone by. 'The sea-front of Plymouth,' says Mr Norway, 'is the most\r\ninteresting spot within the British Empire, if not also the most\r\nbeautiful. It is a large claim, but who can deny it?'\r\n\r\nNo one who has not studied the history of the Three Towns can realize\r\nhow keenly Plymouth has been affected by every declaration of war or\r\npeace that this country has known--at latest, since the reign of Edward\r\nI--nor how vividly its victories and disasters have been brought home to\r\nthe people. The number of fleets that have returned to this port in\r\ntriumph, or sometimes in humiliation, and the succession of ever-famous\r\nexpeditions that have sailed from the Sound, must continually have\r\ncarried their thoughts across the seas, and prevented petty local\r\naffairs from bounding their horizon. The old chronicles seem to show\r\nthat stirring events perpetually followed each other at short\r\nintervals, and when no great expedition was occupying men's minds,\r\nthere were usually plenty of adventurous spirits to provide\r\nexcitement--privateers, such as those who took service with the Prince\r\nof Condé, and searched the Channel for Roman Catholic ships, and others,\r\nready for 'semi-piratical ventures.' There were also moments when\r\nPlymouth was the victim, and in dread watched for the Turkish and\r\nAlgerine pirates who were known to be hovering near, and were making\r\nraids in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nPlymouth seems to keep a peculiarly strong hold on the affections of her\r\nsons, no matter how far or wide they wander, and it is said that the\r\ncity 'has given its name to more towns than any other town or city in\r\nthe world. There are seventeen Aberdeens outside Scotland. There are\r\ntwenty-nine Londons, but forty Plymouths.'\r\n\r\nFrom the Hoe, one point after another that catches the eye suggests a\r\nfresh train of ideas. To the east is Sutton Pool, with its coasting\r\nvessels and fishing-boats; south, across the Cattewater, lies Mount\r\nBatten, whose round tower recalls the long and resolute defence of the\r\ntown in the Civil War. Still farther south are the high grounds of\r\nPlymstock and Bovisand, with their modern fortifications; to the north\r\nstretches the town and far in the distance the heights of Dartmoor; and\r\nto the south-west, over the Cornish border, lies beautiful Mount\r\nEdgcumbe, which 'so affected the Duke of Medina-Sidonia' Fuller tells\r\nus,'(though but beholding it at a distance from the Sea), that he\r\nresolved it for his own possession in the partage of this kingdom (blame\r\nhim not if choosing best for himself), which they had preconquered in\r\ntheir hopes and expectation.' Mr Norway sketches the view in rapid\r\ntouches: 'The Sound lies veiled in a thin blue mist, behind which a hot\r\nsun beats, scattering it gradually with the aid of a stiff breeze off\r\nthe land. But it hangs around Mount Edgcumbe on the right, where the\r\ngrey towers of the mansion stand in shadow among dark woods, while on\r\nthe summit of the hill above the green fields catch the sunlight. A\r\nlittle lower, Drake's Island lies impalpable and dim amid the mist which\r\nsweeps so softly round the forts and the green grassy slopes as to touch\r\nit all with mystery one moment, while the next it is bright again with\r\nsunlight, sparkling amid the dazzling sea. Within the breakwater the sea\r\nis alive with craft.'\r\n\r\nThe little island in the Sound has been transferred from patron to\r\npatron. Originally called after St Michael, to whom its chapel was\r\ndedicated, the name was changed to that of St Nicholas, the patron saint\r\nof mariners, and eventually the island was renamed in honour of\r\nPlymouth's greatest hero. The chapel had been destroyed before Drake's\r\nday at the bidding of the Privy Council, and fortifications were\r\nreluctantly built upon it by the Mayor and Corporation, the Council\r\n'mervelinge of their unwillingnesse to proceede in the fortefynge of St\r\nMichaell's Chapele to be made a Bulwarke.'\r\n\r\nPlymouth is not rich in old buildings. The Citadel was rebuilt in the\r\nreign of Charles II, and the new Guildhall is little over thirty years\r\nold. St Andrew's, a large Perpendicular building with a fine tower, is\r\nthe only old church, but it stands on the site of a much older one--the\r\nchurch of the Augustinians of Plympton Priory.\r\n\r\nReally, neither Stonehouse nor Devonport has any history. In the reign\r\nof Henry III, Stonehouse consisted of the dwelling of Joel de\r\nStonehouse, who at that time owned the manor, and it is only\r\ncomparatively lately, since it has been transformed into a huge naval\r\nstorehouse, and the great Marine Barracks have been built, that it has\r\nbecome of importance.\r\n\r\nDevonport, looking over the broad glittering waters of Hamoaze, was till\r\nthe year 1824 known only as Dock, or Plymouth Dock. Charles II planned a\r\ndockyard here, but the work of making it was not begun until the reign\r\nof William and Mary.\r\n\r\nThe very early history of Plymouth is not specially interesting to\r\nanyone who cares over-much for sober fact; but looking at it in the\r\ngenerous spirit of the ancient chroniclers, and not stickling over\r\nprobabilities, the story of the first great event in Plymouth is almost\r\nas fine as the traditions of Totnes itself. Giants, we all know,\r\nflourished in Cornwall, and soon after the arrival of the Trojans--about\r\n1200 B.C.--they made a furious onslaught upon the invaders, but were\r\ndefeated after a desperate battle. The crowning struggle between\r\nGoemagot (the name afterwards turned into Gogmagog), chief of the\r\ngiants, and Corinæus the Trojan, took place in Plymouth Hoe, as\r\nDrayton's vigorous lines declare:\r\n\r\n    'Upon that loftie place at Plimmouth called the Hoe,\r\n    Those mightie Wrastlers met, with many an irefull looke\r\n    Who threatned, as the one hold of the other tooke:\r\n    But, grappled, glowing fire shines in their sparkling eyes.\r\n    And whilst at length of arme one from the other lyes,\r\n    Their lusty sinewes swell like cables, as they strive:\r\n    Their feet such trampling make, as though they forc't to drive\r\n    A thunder out of earth; which staggered with the weight:\r\n    Thus, either sat most force urg'd to the greatest height.'\r\n\r\nA memorial of this terrific conflict, 'the portraiture of two men of the\r\nlargest volume,' was cut in the turf on the Hoe at an early date, and\r\nwas only destroyed when the Citadel was built about 1671.\r\n\r\nIn the Domesday Book Plymouth appears as the Manor of Sutton, and this\r\nwas later on divided into three separate portions--Sutton Valletort or\r\nVautier, Sutton Prior, and Sutton Raf. The village of Sutton Valletort\r\nwas 'the germ of ancient Plymouth.' Sutton was given by Henry I to\r\nReginald de Valletort, who bestowed lavish gifts on the monastery at\r\nPlympton; and as his example was followed by his successors, the title\r\nof the second portion of the manor is easily accounted for. The whole\r\nplace was dominated by the Valletorts and the Priors, but the power of\r\nthe monks increased steadily, till, at an inquisition held in 1281, 'it\r\nwas presented that the Ville of Sutton belonged to the Prior of\r\nPlympton, with assize of bread and beer, and this right was allowed.'\r\nSutton was now becoming a flourishing town, and some years later the\r\nKing made inquiries about his property in it, for the burgesses had\r\npetitioned that some waste land might be granted them at a yearly rent.\r\nTo this 'the Prior and the Valletorts declared that the town was wholly\r\ntheirs, and none of the King's,' and the dispute was followed by a\r\nseries of efforts, on the part of the townspeople, to free themselves\r\nfrom the rule of the Priors--efforts which succeeded each other, at no\r\nlong intervals, through the next hundred and twenty years.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, the Crown gradually granted rights to the burgesses,\r\nand increased their responsibilities, till in 1439 an Act of Parliament\r\nwas passed incorporating the three Suttons as a free borough, with one\r\nMayor, and the manorial rights of the Priory were ceded to the Mayor and\r\nCorporation, who paid to the Priory a fixed yearly sum in compensation.\r\nThe name Plymouth, which had been used in speaking of the port, was now\r\nformally adopted for the whole town.\r\n\r\nFrom the 'mene thing, as an inhabitation for Fischars,' that Leland says\r\nit was in the reign of Henry II, the town grew rapidly, and before the\r\nend of the thirteenth century it was represented in Parliament. In 1287,\r\nfor the first time on record, the splendid harbour was officially\r\nrecognized as a grand rendezvous, and three hundred and twenty-five\r\nvessels gathered here before sailing for Guienne under the command of\r\nthe King's brother. Half a century later, orders were sent that men and\r\nships should be collected at Plymouth to escort Princess Johanna, the\r\nKing's daughter, to Gascony, and escorts for various Princes had to be\r\nprovided on several occasions. The Black Prince was kept by contrary\r\nwinds in the port for forty days, when he was on his way to France to\r\nfight the 'glorious battell at Poictiers.' In the early part of the\r\nfifteenth century Plymouth suffered severely from the attacks of the\r\nFrench and Bretons, and in 1403 the Bretons, under the Sieur du Chastel,\r\nburned six hundred houses in the part since called Briton Side. The name\r\nbecame gradually transformed into 'Burton,' but the memory of the raid\r\nsurvived so far, Mr Worth tells us, as to enable the boys who lived in\r\nthe Old Town to taunt the 'Burton boys' during the wars with France, by\r\nreminding them of the harm that the French had done to their quarter.\r\n\r\nOn Freedom Day, a 'local Saturnalia kept as such from the earliest\r\ntimes,' one of the features was the fighting between the Old Town and\r\nBurton boys for a barrel of beer, provided by the Mayor. Long after this\r\ncustom had been dropped, the recollection of it was revived by the sign\r\nof a public-house, the Burton Boys, though eventually the owner changed\r\nthe sign to that of the Black Lion, as he 'wished for some more\r\npeaceful name'!\r\n\r\nPlymouth does not seem to have been much affected by the Wars of the\r\nRoses, but Henry VII, as Earl of Richmond, 'while he houered upon the\r\ncoast,' came ashore at Cawsand, and here 'by stealth refreshed himselfe;\r\nbut being advertised of streight watch, kept for his surprising at\r\nPlymouth, he richly rewarded his hoste, hyed speedily a ship boord, and\r\nescaped happily to a better fortune.'\r\n\r\nThe fisheries of the port are old and important. The earliest grant now\r\nto be traced, made by Reginald de Valletort to Plympton Priory, was that\r\nof all his fishing rights in Tamar and Lynher--a privilege which Mr\r\nWorth thinks was probably bestowed 'not long after the manor passed into\r\nthe hands of the Valletort family.' In 1384 Parliament decreed that all\r\nfish caught in the waters of Sutton, Plymouth, and Tamar should be\r\ndisplayed for sale in Plymouth and Aish [Saltash] only, which sounds as\r\nif Plymouth were already jealous of other fish-markets, as was certainly\r\nthe case later on. During parts of the sixteenth century the industry\r\nflagged, and in Henry VIII's reign a royal proclamation ordered\r\nabstinence from flesh on Saturdays as well as Fridays, with the frank\r\nexplanation that this was 'not only for health and discipline, but for\r\nthe benefit of the Commonwealth, and profit of the fishing trade.' In\r\nQueen Elizabeth's reign matters were still worse, for the eating of fish\r\nhad now come to be a badge of religious opinions, and '\"to detest fish\"\r\nin all shapes and forms had become a note of Protestantism.'\r\n\r\nAnd not only had the demand for fish lessened, but the fisheries had\r\nfallen into the hands of foreigners. The Yarmouth waters were 'occupied\r\nby Flemings and Frenchmen,' 'the narrow seas by the French,' 'the\r\nwestern fishing for hake and pilchard by a great navy of French within\r\nkenning of the English shores,' and Scots and Spaniards fished other\r\nparts of the coasts. Cecil, who was anxious for greater reasons, to find\r\n'means to encourage mariners,' set to work to revive the English\r\nfishing-trade, and with great difficulty succeeded in carrying a Bill\r\nthrough the House of Commons, making 'the eating of flesh on Fridays\r\nand Saturdays a misdemeanour, punishable by a fine of three pounds or\r\nthree months' imprisonment, and as if this was not enough, adding\r\nWednesday as a subsidiary half-fish day.'\r\n\r\nAbout this time Plymouth tried to rid itself of at least one branch of\r\nforeign competition by appealing to the Privy Council to forbid 'the\r\nexportation of pilchards, save in ships of Devon and Cornwall, because\r\n\"divers ships and mariners lye idle without employment within our\r\nharbour,\" while foreign ships were continually employed.' Pilchards were\r\na very important item, and many regulations were made in reference to\r\nthem. One order, dated 1565-66, gives a good example of Plymouth's views\r\nof free trade. It ran: 'That no alien should lade or buy fresh pilchards\r\nabove the number of 1,000 in a day; no man ... being free to buy or sell\r\nabove 5,000, unless the fish \"were in danger of perishing.\"' The\r\nbusiness of curing fish was a large one and very jealously guarded. At\r\nthe British Museum, among the Lansdowne manuscripts, is a letter to Lord\r\nBurghley from Mr Richard Browne, showing that this subject was sometimes\r\nthe source of friction between the citizens themselves. It begins:\r\n\r\n'My honorable good Lord, as I have ben always most bound vnto yor ho.,\r\nso I humbly besech you to stand my good Lord.' The letter goes on to\r\nexplain that the writer had been granted a 'pattent for salting, drying,\r\nand packing of fishe in the counties of Devon and Cornwall,' but letters\r\nfrom the Privy Council had caused the 'staie thereof.' These letters\r\nwere apparently inspired by the complaint to the Council of 'marchants,'\r\nwho were injured because the terms of the 'pattent' laid down 'that the\r\ninhabitants should be servid before the marchents, paying nothing unto\r\nme for it,' as he adds in a slightly aggrieved manner. The writer begs\r\nthat these terms may be altered, and the only conditions should be those\r\naffecting such fish 'as shuld be transported in consyderacon of the\r\nQuene's Majesty's right.' For, he pathetically remarks, he has paid 'a\r\ngreat some of money' for his privileges, and still 'am bound to pay the\r\nrent into the exchequer,' although not allowed to reap the benefit\r\ntherefrom. Besides, great inconvenience is caused by the suspension of\r\nhis business, and letters of complaint have been addressed to him from\r\nDevonshire and Cornwall desiring 'y^t he pforme his offer y^t they may\r\nhave fishe for their owne provesion frely.'\r\n\r\nIt was the outburst of ventures of every description, with all their\r\ndifferent aims--ventures of soldiers, explorers, privateers, and\r\nmerchants--in the reign of Queen Elizabeth that brought Plymouth to its\r\ngreatest glory. In the interval between William Hawkins' first voyage to\r\nthe South Seas--about 1528--and 1601, when Captain William Parker sailed\r\nto Panama and took Porto Bello, Plymouth was the starting-point of forty\r\nvoyages, every one of which is historical. Mr Worth gives the exact date\r\nof each, and the names of the commanders. 'Here,' says Carew, 'mostly\r\nhave the troops of adventurers made their _Rendezvous_ for attempting\r\nnew discoueries or inhabitances.' And Westcote, in the reign of James I,\r\nwrites: 'Whatever show it makes in description, it is far larger in\r\nfame, and known to the farthest and most remote parts of the world.' In\r\nCamden's opinion, this great reputation was won 'less by the convenience\r\nof the harbour, as for the valour and worth of the Inhabitants,' and the\r\nworthies of Plymouth are indeed beyond number. Among the comparatively\r\nfew whose names have not been lost, there stands out conspicuously Sir\r\nWilliam Wilford, who after a French invasion returned the charge by\r\nswooping down on Brittany, where he 'made them to pay, besides _costs_\r\nand _charges_, more than sixfold _damages_.' And Captain Cocke, a 'Cock\r\nof the Game indeed,' according to Fuller; 'A Volanteer in his own ship,'\r\nhe went out against the Armada, and 'lost his life to save his Queen and\r\nCountrey.' Then there is Cockrem, who sailed with William Hawkins, and\r\nwas left alone among the Brazilians as a hostage for one of the 'Savage\r\nKings' Hawkins brought back with him--but, as Mr Norway says, 'Plymouth\r\nhas too many heroes; in the crowd the faces of all but one or two are\r\nblurred.'\r\n\r\nFor three generations the Hawkinses were 'the master spirits' of\r\nPlymouth, and of them all Sir John Hawkins was the most famous. His\r\ncharacter was a curious medley of incongruous features, bluff\r\nstraightforwardness and crooked diplomacy, faithful affection--such as\r\nhis bold schemes to help his captured comrades proved--balanced by a\r\nhard indifference that ignored the misery of the wretched negroes he\r\nsold to West Indian planters. Pluck and daring were the only qualities\r\nhe showed consistently from first to last. His zeal in slave-hunting,\r\nrepulsive to us, is excused by Froude on the ground that 'negro slavery\r\nin theory was an invention of philanthropy.' Labourers were a necessity\r\nfor the Spanish colonist, 'the proud and melancholy Indian pined like an\r\neagle in captivity, refused to accept his servitude, and died; the more\r\ntractable negro would domesticate like the horse or the ass.' Though\r\nHawkins met with much good as well as bad luck, he was one of those who\r\nhave need to remember that fate does not shower favours on all men, but\r\n'if a man look sharply and attentively, he shall see Fortune; for though\r\nshe be blind, yet she is not invisible,' and his success was to a very\r\ngreat extent due to his stout heart and quick discernment. These\r\nqualities stood him in good stead at San Juan de Ulloa, when his few\r\nships were overwhelmed by a much larger fleet. 'The name of Hawkins was\r\nso terrible that the Spaniards dared not give him warning that he was to\r\nbe attacked;' but mounted their batteries in the dark, and from land and\r\nsea 'every gun which could be brought to bear' opened upon the\r\nunprepared English. After sinking two Spanish ships and setting a third\r\non fire, Hawkins saw that flight was their only chance, and, gathering\r\nhis men together in two small tenders, he 'crawled out under the fire of\r\nthe mole and gained the open sea.' The position of affairs was\r\ndispiriting in the extreme. Many men and three good ships were lost,\r\nbesides treasure worth more than a million pounds, that had been won, by\r\nrunning innumerable dangers, during the past year. His ships were\r\novercrowded, the store of food and water was scanty, and no harbour west\r\nof the Atlantic was open to them. Under the weight of adversity, Hawkins\r\noffered 'a lesson for all time on the use of bravado, the crowning grace\r\nof every leader who does not seek it at the cost of better things.'\r\n\r\n'When the _Minion_ stood off,' says Hortop, who wrote the tale on his\r\nreturn to England, 'our generall courageously cheered up his soldiers\r\nand gunners, and called to Samuel his page for a cup of beer, who\r\nbrought it to him in a silver cup. And he, drinking to all the men,\r\nwilled the gunners to stand to their ordnance lustily like men. He had\r\nno sooner set the cup out of his hand, but a demi-culverin shot struck\r\naway the cup and a cooper's plane that stood by the mainmast and ran out\r\non the other side of the ship, which nothing dismayed our generall, for\r\nhe ceased not to encourage us, saying, \"Fear nothing: for God who hath\r\npreserved me from this shot will also deliver us from these traitors and\r\nvillains.\"'\r\n\r\nHawkins is chiefly known by his voyages and enterprises, and all that he\r\ndid for his country by monotonous hard work is not so often remembered.\r\nFor twenty-one years he 'toiled terribly' as Treasurer of the Queen's\r\nMarine Causes and Comptroller of the Navy, and when the ships were sent\r\nout to meet the Armada they were 'in such condition, hull, rigging,\r\nspars, and running rope, that they had no match in the world either for\r\nspeed, safety, or endurance.'\r\n\r\nThere is no space here to speak of Sir John's father, 'the pioneer of\r\nEnglish adventure in the South Seas,' who made three famous voyages to\r\nBrazil, and laid a good foundation for future traffic in that he\r\n'behaved wisely' to the natives; nor to do more than glance at the\r\nventures of Sir John's son, Sir Richard Hawkins, the 'Complete Seaman,'\r\nwhose 'high-spirited actions, had they been all duly recorded (as pity\r\nit is, they were not),' says Prince, 'would have made a large volume in\r\nthemselves.' Sir Richard rediscovered the Falkland Isles, and passed the\r\nStraits of Magellan. His fleet was reduced to a single vessel, and he\r\nhad taken five richly laden ships, when 'the King of Spain's vice-roy in\r\nthose parts' sent 'eight ships to intercept him. Sir Richard Hawkins\r\nheld the fight for three days, with but three score and fifteen men and\r\nboys, against thirteen hundred of the enemy, and those the choice of\r\nPeru.' In the end, being 'dangerously wounded in six several places,'\r\nand with many of his crew killed or wounded, he was forced to surrender\r\nupon 'honourable articles of life and liberty,' which, however, were not\r\nobserved, and he was sent to Spain, where for long years he remained a\r\nprisoner. Sir Richard left an account of his 'Voyage to the South\r\nSea'--a 'record of misfortune, but of misfortune which did no dishonour\r\nto him who sank under it; and there is a melancholy dignity in the style\r\nin which Hawkins tells his story, which seems to say that ... he\r\nrespects himself still for the heart with which he endured a shame which\r\nwould have broken a smaller man.' A second William Hawkins, Sir John's\r\nbrother, commanded a Huguenot vessel under the commission of the Prince\r\nof Condé; and yet another William of a younger generation went as\r\nambassador of the East India Company to the Great Mogul, and succeeded\r\nin setting up a trading station at Surat.\r\n\r\nEvery Plymouth hero, however, is eclipsed by Sir Francis Drake, who is\r\nalways counted their chief, though he was born near Tavistock. 'Could my\r\npen as ably describe his worth as my heart prompteth to it, I would make\r\nthis day-star appear at noon-day as doth the full moon at midnight,' is\r\nRisdon's ecstatic exclamation.\r\n\r\nWhen all his grand qualities and successes have been contemplated, it is\r\nstill rather surprising to find the extraordinary impression he created\r\nin that epoch of heroic enterprise. The stories of magic that have\r\nclustered round his name witness to his wonderful personality, for\r\nnaturally they are much more significant than those that have been woven\r\naround the older heroes of a more superstitious, less civilized age.\r\nThese legends must have been handed down to generation after generation,\r\nfor, writing about 1835, Mrs Bray mentions that the peasantry near\r\nTavistock still talked of the 'old warrior,' as they called him. To\r\nchoose one or two at random, there is the story that once, after he had\r\nbeen away for a very long time, his wife supposed him to be dead, and\r\nthought that she was free to marry again. A spirit whispered the news to\r\nSir Francis, who was at the Antipodes. At once he fired a great\r\ncannon-ball, 'so truly aimed that it shot up right through the globe,\r\nforced its way into the church, and fell with a loud explosion between\r\nthe lady and her intended bridegroom. \"It is the signal of Drake!\" she\r\nexclaimed. \"He is alive, and I am still a wife. There must be neither\r\ntroth nor ring between thee and me.\"' Another story tells that after he\r\nhad finished the ever-famous game of bowls on Plymouth Hoe, which was\r\ninterrupted by tidings of the Armada, Sir Francis cut up a block of\r\nwood, and flung the chips into the sea, when every ship became a\r\nfire-ship, and the enemy's fleet was really destroyed because of the\r\n'irresistable strength of those vessels that he had called up to \"flame\r\namazement\" on the foes of Elizabeth and of England.'\r\n\r\nWhen the citizens of Plymouth wanted a more abundant supply of water,\r\nthey appealed to Drake, and he was ready to help them. 'So he called for\r\nhis horse, mounted, rode to Dartmoor, and hunted about till he found a\r\nvery fine spring. Having fixed on one that would suit his purpose, he\r\ngave a smart lash to his horse's side, pronouncing as he did so some\r\nmagical words, when off went the animal as fast as he could gallop, and\r\nthe stream followed his heels all the way into the town.' It is not\r\npossible here to pick more legends from the group, excepting one which\r\nwas certainly told among the people a few years ago. Drake promised,\r\nthey said, that if ever the country were hard pressed by any foe, and\r\nhis countrymen should call him by striking his drum, he would hear them,\r\nand come back and scatter the enemy.\r\n\r\nOf Drake it has been said that 'his Puritanism went hand-in-hand with\r\nhis love of adventure. 'To sell negroes to the planters, to kill\r\nSpaniards, to sack gold-ships, was in the young seaman's mind the work\r\nof \"the elect of God\"'--a belief that no doubt partly explains how the\r\nmost desperate circumstances seemed unable to teach him the meaning of\r\nfear. It is easy to understand how a leader who combined such glorious\r\ncourage with great unselfishness could take his men anywhere. On\r\narriving off the coast, on his first independent voyage to America, he\r\nfound this encouraging greeting--'a plate of lead, fastened to a very\r\ngreat tree,' engraved with a message which began:\r\n\r\n     'CAPTAIN DRAKE,\r\n\r\n     'If you fortune to come into this port, make haste away, for the\r\n     Spaniards which you had with you here last year have betrayed this\r\n     place.'\r\n\r\nThe message was signed by Captain Garret of Plymouth. Quite undismayed\r\nby the warning, Drake led his company to Nombre de Dios, which they\r\nsuccessfully attacked. Here he received a dangerous wound; though he\r\nvaliantly concealed it a long time, knowing if the general's heart\r\nstoops, the men's will fall, and that if so bright an opportunity once\r\nsetteth, it seldom riseth again.' And he went forward till 'at the\r\npublic treasury they had discovered ... bars of silver, piled up against\r\nthe wall, seventy foot in length, ten in breadth, and twelve in height\r\n... withal telling them, \"That he had brought them to the mouth of the\r\ntreasury of the world.\"' But before much could be done his strength\r\nfailed and he fainted, when his followers became aware of the wound that\r\nhe had not mentioned, but from which he was losing 'so much blood as\r\nfilled his very footsteps in the sands.' They were at once anxious to\r\ntake him back to his ship; Drake, on recovering consciousness, being the\r\nonly man who wished them to persevere in their search for gold and\r\njewels. But his men 'added force to their entreaties, and so carried him\r\nto his pinnace.'\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was able, Drake started on fresh enterprises with varying\r\nsuccess, and after several months had passed on returning laden with\r\ntreasure to the point on the coast at which he expected to meet his\r\npinnaces, to his great dismay he found none, but saw seven Spanish ships\r\nlying in the distance. The company instantly fell into despair,\r\nconvinced that their pinnaces had been taken and the crews tortured, and\r\nthat they themselves were left alone in the midst of the enemy's\r\ncountry, from which they could not escape. Drake's self-possession alone\r\nwas unshaken, and, after casting about for some way of reaching safety,\r\nhe noticed trees floating slowly down the river. With 'the most\r\nconfident and cheerful expression, he asked: \"Who would accompany him to\r\nsea on the raft he was about to form with those timbers?\"' A sail was\r\n'made of a bisket-sack,' and with 'an oar shaped out of a young tree for\r\na rudder,' they set out to sea, in danger of being swamped by every\r\nwave, and often waist-deep in water. After about six hours of extreme\r\nperil they sighted the pinnaces, and in the end Drake succeeded in\r\nreaching them, and was able to carry away the rest of his company and\r\nthe treasure.\r\n\r\nAn incident that happened when Drake was taking leave of some friendly\r\nnegroes showed his generous disposition. 'Pedro, ... an eminent person\r\namong the Symerons, and one who had been greatly serviceable to Captain\r\nDrake, had a great mind to a rich cymeter the captain had, but was\r\nunwilling to ask it, lest he should prize it also: which known, the\r\ncaptain freely presented it to him. Who being willing to make a grateful\r\nreturn, desired him to accept of four wedges of gold, as a pledge of his\r\nthanks: whose importunity not being able to avoid, Captain Drake\r\nreceived them courteously, but threw them into the common stock, saying,\r\n\"That it was just that those who bore part of the charge with him, in\r\nsetting him to sea, should likewise enjoy their full proportion of the\r\nadvantage at his return.\"'\r\n\r\nAll Drake's voyages and adventures, however, did not prevent him from\r\nkeeping in touch with Plymouth and local interests. In 1581 he was\r\nMayor; for four years he represented the borough in Parliament, and he\r\ncertainly did bring the citizens water from Dartmoor, though at greater\r\npains than in the fashion described in the legend. In memory of this\r\ngreat service there is still an annual ceremony called the Fishing\r\nFeast. The Mayor and Corporation inspect the leat by which the water is\r\nbrought to Plymouth, attended by a huge crowd of spectators, and\r\nafterwards two toasts are drunk--one in water, to 'The pious memory of\r\nSir Francis Drake,' and the other in wine--'May the descendants of him\r\nwho brought us water never want wine.'\r\n\r\nPlymouth townsfolk had every reason to be glad when the _Pelican_ sailed\r\ninto the harbour after her voyage round the world, for it was not only a\r\nnational hero, but their own particular countryman and good friend, that\r\nthey hurried out to welcome.\r\n\r\nAmongst 'Commendations by Principal Persons friendly to the Author or\r\nthe Work' which preface a book written by Sir Humphrey Gilbert, are some\r\nlines by Sir Francis which are very expressive of the views that seem to\r\nhave guided his life. The book, whose aim must have been to encourage\r\nthe idea of settling in the new colony, is called 'A true Report of the\r\nlate Discoveries and Possession taken in the Right of the Crowne of\r\nEnglande, of the _New found_ Landes.' I do not quote the whole poem:\r\n\r\n    'Who seekes by gaine and wealth to advance his house and blood,\r\n    Whose care is great, whose toile no less, whose hope is all for good,\r\n    If anie one there bee that covettes such a trade,\r\n    Lo heere the plot for commonwealth, and private gaine is made.\r\n\r\n    'He that for vertue's sake will venture farre and neere,\r\n    Whose zeale is strong, whose practize trueth, whose faith is void of\r\n      feare,\r\n    If any such there bee, inflamed with holie care,\r\n\r\n    'Heere may hee finde a readie meane his purpose to declare,\r\n    So that for each degree this Treatise dooth unfolde\r\n    The path to fame, the proofe of zeale, and way to purchase golde.'\r\n\r\nDrake's audacity was never more amazing than in the expedition of 1587,\r\nwhen he sailed along the Spanish and Portuguese coast, plundering and\r\nburning the ships in their own harbours. His fearlessness filled the\r\nSpaniards with a very generous admiration. 'So praised was Drake for his\r\nvalour of them, that were it not that he was a Lutheran, they said,\r\nthere was not the like man in the world.' Once, when the King invited a\r\nlady of the Court to go in his barge on a lake near Madrid, 'the lady\r\nsaid she dared not trust herself in the water even with his Majesty,\r\nlest Sir Francis Drake should have her.' His name passed even into\r\nnursery songs, and one of them has been translated as follows:\r\n\r\n    'My brother Don John\r\n    To England is gone,\r\n        To kill the Drake,\r\n    And the Queen to take,\r\n    And the heretics all to destroy;\r\n        And he will give me,\r\n        When he comes back,\r\n            A Lutheran boy,\r\n            With a chain on his neck,\r\n    And our Lady Grandmama shall have\r\n    To wait upon her a Lutheran slave.'\r\n\r\nIt was about sixteen months later that Drake, amongst the band of famous\r\ncaptains gathered at Plymouth, watched the long-awaited Armada sailing\r\nin a great crescent up the Channel. The English popular view of the\r\ninvasion is, perhaps, reflected in a ballad which was written soon after\r\nthe event. It is called 'Sir Francis Drake; or, Eighty-eight.'\r\n\r\n    'In eyghtye-eyght, ere I was borne,\r\n        As I can well remember,\r\n    In August was a fleet prepared,\r\n        The moneth before September.\r\n\r\n    'Spayne, with Biscayne, Portugall,\r\n        Toledo, and Granado,\r\n    All these did meet, and made a fleet,\r\n        And called it the Armado.\r\n\r\n    'When they had gott provision,\r\n        As mustard, pease, and bacon;\r\n    Some say two shipps were full of whipps,\r\n        But I thinke they were mistaken.\r\n\r\n    'There was a little man of Spaine\r\n        That shott well in a gunn-a--\r\n    Don Pedro bright, as good a knight\r\n        As the knight of the sunn-a.\r\n\r\n    'King Phillip made him Admiral,\r\n        And charged him not to stay-a--\r\n    But to destroy both man and boy,\r\n        And then to runn away-a.\r\n\r\n    'The King of Spayne did freet amayne,\r\n        And to doe yet more harme-a,\r\n    He sent along to make him strong\r\n        The famous Prince of Parma.\r\n\r\n    When they had sayl'd along the seas,\r\n        And anchored uppon Dover,\r\n    Our Englishmen did board them then,\r\n        And cast the Spaniards over.\r\n\r\n    'Oure Queene was then att Tilbury;\r\n        What could you more desire-a?\r\n    For whose sweete sake Sir Francis Drake\r\n        Did sett them all on fyre-a.\r\n\r\n    'But let them look about themselfes;\r\n        For if they come again-a.\r\n    They shall be served with that same sauce\r\n        As they were, I know when-a.'\r\n\r\nIn 1595 Sir Francis and Sir John Hawkins started on that ill-starred\r\nexpedition to the West Indies, from which neither returned. Sir Francis\r\ndied, and was buried at sea.\r\n\r\n    'The waves became his winding-sheet, the waters were his tomb;\r\n    But, for his fame, the ocean sea was not sufficient room.'\r\n\r\nThe translation of what Prince calls an 'ingenuous epigram' written in\r\nLatin is beneath his portrait in the Guildhall:\r\n\r\n    'Sir Drake, whom well the world's end knew,\r\n      Which thou didst compasse round,\r\n    And whom both poles of Heaven one saw,\r\n      Which North and South doe bound:\r\n    The starrs above will make thee known,\r\n      If men here silent were;\r\n    The Sunn himself cannot forget\r\n      His fellow Traveller.'\r\n\r\nIn 1606 the Plymouth Trading Company was granted its charter. The\r\nCompany was formed with the aim of planting colonies in America but it\r\nwas not a great success, and the extortionate claims of the members to a\r\nmonopoly of very important privileges brought them into violent\r\ncollision with the more flourishing Massachusetts Company, as well as\r\nwith owners of certain fishing-vessels, whom they called 'interlopers.'\r\nThe company was eventually dissolved in 1635.\r\n\r\nIn 1620 there came into Plymouth Harbour that little band of Puritans\r\nknown to posterity as the Pilgrim Fathers. For the sake of liberty of\r\nconscience they had been living for some years at Leyden, and they had\r\nnow resolved to take up a new life in America. The start was not\r\nauspicious, for after leaving Southampton they were forced to put into\r\nDartmouth for repairs, and were afterwards obliged to stop at Plymouth,\r\nwhere the _Speedwell_ was declared to be unseaworthy. Serious\r\nalterations of their plans had to be made, but at last, 'all troubles\r\nbeing blown over,' the travellers were 'compacted together in the one\r\nship,' and on September 6, 1620, 'thirteen years after the first\r\ncolonization of Virginia, two months before the concession of the grand\r\ncharter of Plymouth, without any warrant from the sovereign of England,\r\nwithout any useful charter from a corporate body, the passengers in the\r\n_Mayflower_ set sail for a New World.'\r\n\r\nKing Charles and Queen Henrietta Maria paid a visit to the town, to\r\nspeed a fleet sent, with disastrous results, against Spain. The\r\nexpedition was in a miserable plight to begin with. For some while\r\nbefore it was able to leave the country, a hungry penniless army had\r\nbeen thrown upon the citizens of Plymouth. An enormous debt had been\r\ncreated in equipping it, and the soldiers' allowances were hopelessly\r\ninadequate to provide them with a proper supply of food or clothes. 'A\r\nmore ragged, ribald, and rebellious herde never gathered on the eve of\r\nan important expedition. Mutiny was common in the town, and the\r\nringleaders were tried at Drum-head, and shot in the nearest open\r\nspace.... Incensed at the disregard of their appeals, the publicans\r\nthrust the soldiers to doors; and the outcasts, turning highwaymen,\r\nstole cattle and sheep with impunity, slew the animals, and cooked the\r\njoints \"in the open eye of the world,\" and sullenly vowed that they\r\nwould have \"meat rather than famish.\" The fleet returned some weeks\r\nlater in shame and disgrace, and the state of the men was even more\r\nmiserable than when they started, for now the plague was raging amongst\r\nthem. 'There was neither \"meat nor drink available\"; such provisions as\r\nhad been doled out were often unfit for food, and \"men die after eating\r\nthem.\"' Pennington, the Vice-Admiral at Plymouth, sent petition after\r\npetition to the authorities for necessary supplies. 'Send the money, or\r\nit will break my heart, for I am so followed about and called upon that\r\nI know not what to do.' The misery was long drawn out, for when the\r\nplague was at an end, and townspeople were able to return to their\r\nhomes, there was but a short respite before they were again overwhelmed\r\nby a great number of undisciplined soldiers, and 'no means of housing,\r\nfeeding, or clothing them.' Naturally, they helped themselves at the\r\nexpense of the citizens. 'Haunted by the cries of my soldiers,' Sir\r\nFerdinando Gorges, the Governor, was reduced to distributing among them\r\na cargo of oil that had been captured, with the assertion that it was\r\n'as healthy as butter.'\r\n\r\n'Most despair here,' wrote Lord Holland briefly, and 'the distress was\r\nso acute that the Mayor raised the standard of revolt. The losses of the\r\ntown had been calamitous--first at the hands of pirates, next by\r\ncollapse of trade, and finally by the billeting.'\r\n\r\nNo doubt Plymouth's consistent hostility to the King's party throughout\r\nthe war is in part explained by the results of this wretched state of\r\naffairs, and by the persecution of their Vice-Admiral, the heroic member\r\nfor St Germans, Sir John Eliot.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the war broke out, Plymouth's sympathies were plainly shown,\r\nand before long Sir Ralph Hopton made an attack on the town. On December\r\n1, 1642, Royalists and Parliamentarians 'stood upon the Lary for the\r\nspace of three hours' facing one another, but each too cautious to make\r\nthe first move and leave a point of vantage. The siege was seriously\r\nundertaken three months later, when Hopton concentrated all his forces\r\nupon the town. As Plymouth could always be supplied by sea, there was no\r\nchance of its being starved into submission, and already it was gravely\r\ndoubted whether the town would ever be taken. By the beginning of July\r\nnearly all the Royalist forces had been drawn off, and Plymouth set to\r\nwork with great energy to strengthen the defences by building a new\r\nwall. Tradition says that even women and children took a share in the\r\nwork. In August an attack was made by Colonel Digby, but the town was at\r\nthis time threatened by a greater danger--the treachery of Sir Alexander\r\nCarew, commander of the Fort and of Drake's Island. 'He was proved an\r\nApostate,' says a contemporary account, 'and went about to betray that\r\nisland and the town of Plymouth into the hands of Cornish cavaliers, but\r\nwas prevented by the fidelity of his honest soldiers.' Sir Alexander was\r\narrested by order of the Mayor, and sent to London, where eventually he\r\nwas beheaded.\r\n\r\nPrince Maurice marched on the town after he had taken Dartmouth, and\r\nthere followed three weeks of assaults and skirmishes, much hard\r\nfighting, and many desperate struggles. In the end the besiegers\r\nsucceeded in capturing Mount Stamford, a fort on the south of the\r\nCattewater, 'the first and only advantage gained by the Royalists during\r\nthe protracted and often revived siege.' An invitation to surrender on\r\nlenient conditions made the townspeople waver, but the Governor,\r\nColonel Wardlaw, stood firm. All were ordered to take a solemn vow and\r\ncovenant, which pledged each one to take part in the defence 'to the\r\nutmost of my power.' And the town, hitherto 'divided and heartless in\r\nits defence, now grew to be united.'\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, December 3, there fell the Sabbath-day Fight, and the most\r\ncritical moments of the siege. Prince Maurice and 'all the gallantry of\r\nhis army' threw their whole force against the garrison, who advanced to\r\nmeet them. 'The Roundheads were outnumbered ten to one, and driven back\r\nin absolute rout for the space of three fields.' Joined by a small\r\nnumber of reinforcements, they rallied after an interval, and charged\r\nthe enemy, who yielded. The garrison pressed their advantage. 'The\r\nretreat, followed up, became a rout,' and the acutest danger was past.\r\n\r\nNot long afterwards the siege was raised for a time. The poor people had\r\nsuffered much from the scarcity of food, though once they had been\r\ncheered by a wonderful supply. 'There came an infinite number of\r\npilchards into the harbour within the Barbican, which the people took up\r\nwith great ease in baskets, which did not only refresh them for the\r\npresent, but a great deal more were taken, preserved and salted, whereby\r\nthe poor got much money.' It was not only by endurance that the women\r\nhad shown their courage, for in the midst of some of the engagements\r\nthey had brought out provisions 'for the refreshing of our soldiers,\r\nthough many women were shot through the clothes.'\r\n\r\nAssaults, occasional sorties, and intervals of comparative peace\r\nfollowed one another till, in September 1644, the King appeared in\r\nperson before the town, and tried first by force of arms and then by\r\noffering very indulgent terms to bring about its surrender. The answer\r\nto the King was not sent till the day after his summons had been\r\nreceived, but 'if not speedy, it was decided--\"Never.\"' A second futile\r\nassault was made by the Royalists, and then the King and Prince Maurice\r\nwith their troops, turned their backs on Plymouth. For four months\r\nlonger the blockade was continued, and at the end of that time Sir\r\nRichard Grenville made a very determined effort, attacking at four\r\npoints simultaneously. A desperate struggle ensued in which he gained\r\nnothing and lost three hundred men killed, and many hundreds wounded.\r\nAnother twelve months passed without any serious attempt to storm the\r\ntown, and in January, 1646, on Fairfax's advance upon Dartmouth the\r\nsiege was finally raised, the Royalists marching away in such haste that\r\nguns, arms, and ammunition were left behind.\r\n\r\nCharles II paid several visits to the town, and on one occasion he\r\nattended the service at St Andrew's Church where a state canopy and\r\nthrone had been prepared for him and where sufferers were brought to him\r\nto be 'touched for the king's evil.' A ridiculous incident marked\r\nanother visit. The Mayor, rather agitated by the honour of entertaining\r\nthe King, and anxious to find the best means of giving him pleasure, had\r\nthe happy inspiration of inviting His Majesty to look at the outworks\r\nthat had protected Plymouth 'in the time of the late war.' The King's\r\nreply was 'on a sudden' to walk to the landing-steps, get into his\r\npinnace, and start for Mount Edgcumbe. The Mayor in great dismay,\r\nfollowed by the Aldermen, who had come in their robes in state to attend\r\non the King, hurried down to the water's edge and taking possession of a\r\nwherry, they started off as fast as they could in pursuit. It is\r\nsatisfactory to know that by the time they succeeded in catching up the\r\nKing he had quite recovered his usual good-humour.\r\n\r\nPlymouth was to some degree affected by the Revocation of the Edict of\r\nNantes, for it had always been a refuge for the Huguenots--the\r\nRochellers, as they are often called in sixteenth-century\r\nchronicles--and now many of them fled to this shelter. The first party\r\nof about fifty people crossed the Channel in an open boat, and their\r\nflight was followed by a great number of refugees. These settled in the\r\ntown, and many of their descendants married English people, and the\r\nlittle colony became absorbed into the general population. A curious\r\nglimpse of the original refugees is given in a letter written in 1762 by\r\nMr Pentecost Barker, of Plymouth, to the Rev. Samuel Merivale. He says:\r\n'Those, of whom I remember many scores, who came from France in 1685-6,\r\netc., are mostly dead, and their offspring are more English than French,\r\nand will go to the English Church, though some few may come to us. What\r\nan alteration Time makes! There was ... a French Calvinist Church and a\r\nChurch of England French Church here, besides a Church at Stonehouse.\r\nMany women in wooden shoes--very poor, but very industrious--living on\r\nlimpets, snails, garlick, and mushrooms.'\r\n\r\nIn the latter half of the eighteenth century Plymouth vibrated with the\r\nexcitement of fights and victories at sea, several engagements being\r\nfought at a short distance off the coast. Many prizes and some of our\r\nown disabled ships were brought into the harbour, 'dismasted and riddled\r\nFrench battleships,' sometimes even with 'their decks blackened with\r\npowder and coursed by the blood of the victims.' Unless the local annals\r\nare closely studied, it is almost impossible to realize the rapid\r\nsuccession of these events, and the effect they must have produced on\r\nthe townspeople. A sarcastic picture has been drawn of a student\r\nattempting to work in the midst of the bursts of enthusiasm that\r\nperpetually thrilled the town. He is first interrupted by 'a shout in\r\nthe street, and the servant rushed in to announce that the enemy had\r\nlanded,' and the Volunteers were going out to meet them. The student,\r\nhaving disposed of this report, settles to work again, when 'the strains\r\nof a soul-stirring march, with abundant drum, were borne on the air, and\r\nthe servant again bounded into the room to proclaim the return of\r\nthe--th Regiment, \"with only 200 returned out of 600, sir, colours shot\r\nthrough and through, poor fellows, all looking terribly tanned--here\r\nthey are, sir, just passing the door.\" The pageant is witnessed by the\r\nstudent, and as the tumult subsides he resumes his scholarly pursuits.\r\nSoon a great gun shakes every window in the house. \"What can this mean?\"\r\nEnter Sam once more. \"I beg your pardon, sir, but they say a\r\nman-of-war's in the Sound, bringing in two ships of the line, French\r\nprizes. All the people are running to the Hoe, sir; I hope you'll let me\r\ngo.\" Down goes the book once more, and the student is as mad as his\r\nneighbours as the victorious ship and her prizes, with the Jack flying\r\ntriumphantly over the tricoloured flag, sails majestically into the\r\nharbour amid deafening cheers.... Such was the average Plymouth day.'\r\n\r\nSeveral times the town was threatened by a French invasion and badly\r\nscared, but the greatest fear was felt in 1779, when for four days the\r\nunited French and Spanish fleets lay off the Sound. Plymouth had every\r\nreason to be afraid; for, had the enemy but known it, there were at that\r\nmoment but two small armed vessels to defend the harbour. Crowds of\r\nwomen and children left the town in haste and confusion, thousands of\r\ncountry-people tramped to the coast to have a look at the enemy. A few\r\nprivate persons made single-handed efforts to strengthen the defences,\r\nand a little later 'the bustle was again revived by the hourly arrival\r\nof troops, baggage, waggons, and powder.'\r\n\r\nIt is said that in Totnes the saying, 'Going to Paignton to meet the\r\nFrench,' is still a synonym for meeting trouble halfway. Amongst endless\r\nstories of fears and flights, there is one of delightful\r\nimperturbability:\r\n\r\n'One old sailor ... had his wits about him, when his daughter shook him\r\nout of a deep sleep with the news that the French had landed. Rubbing\r\nhis eyes, he told her to go and look at the weathercock. She came back,\r\nsaying the wind was from the north. \"I thought so,\" said he, \"and so it\r\nwas yesterday. The French can't land with this wind.\" And so the ancient\r\nmariner turned round and went to sleep again.'\r\n\r\nAlarms, suspense, and occasional ecstasies of triumph followed one\r\nanother till the final defeat of Napoleon. For several days the\r\n_Bellerophon_ actually lay in Plymouth Harbour, to the intense\r\nexcitement of the townspeople, who circled round the ship as closely as\r\nmight be in the hope of catching a glimpse of the captive Emperor.\r\n\r\nTo the north-east of Plymouth lies Saltram, the great house and wide,\r\nbeautiful grounds that belong to Lord Morley. Saltram is in the parish\r\nof Plympton St Mary, once celebrated for the large and important Priory\r\nwhich for some time governed the affairs of Plymouth. Plympton St Mary\r\nis neighbour to the parish of Plympton St Maurice and the little town\r\nof Plympton Erle. On the north of the town are the ruins of the Norman\r\ncastle built chiefly by Richard de Redvers, and razed to the ground in\r\nthe reign of Stephen. It was rebuilt not long afterwards. A fragment of\r\na small keep is all that remains of the stonework, but the Normans'\r\ncastle was raised upon a fort that was standing when they arrived, and\r\n'the earthworks of the conquered are more enduring than the stone\r\ndefences of the conqueror.' The mound on which the keep stands, and the\r\nbanks that enclose a base-court about seven hundred and ten feet long\r\nand three hundred and eighty feet wide, have been little harmed or\r\naltered and are still in a very perfect condition; but the moat that\r\nonce surrounded them has been partly filled in.\r\n\r\nThe father of Sir Joshua Reynolds was master of the Grammar School of\r\nPlympton Erle, and here the great painter was born. In the crowded days\r\nof his middle life he gave a proof of his interest in his native town by\r\nbeing its Mayor, and on his election presented the town with his own\r\nportrait painted by himself. The picture was hung in the Guildhall, and\r\nSir Joshua asked the Recorder of the borough to see that it was hung in\r\na good position. In his reply the Recorder paid a compliment whose full\r\nmeaning he did not grasp. He explained that 'he had seen to this, and\r\nthe portrait hung between old pictures of Ourry and Edgecumbe which\r\nserve as foils, and set it off to great advantage. This letter greatly\r\namused Sir Joshua, who knew that these old pictures were early works of\r\nhis own.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nThe Tamar and the Tavy\r\n\r\n                        'Tavy creeps upon\r\n    The western vales of fertile Albion;\r\n    Here dashes roughly on an aged rock,\r\n    That his intended passage doth up-lock;...\r\n    Here digs a cave at some high mountain's foot,\r\n    There undermines an oak, tears up his root:...\r\n    As (woo'd by May's delights) I have been borne\r\n    To take the kind air of a wistful morn\r\n    Near Tavy's voiceful stream (to whom I owe\r\n    More strains than from my pipe can ever flow).\r\n    Here have I heard a sweet bird never lin[7]\r\n    To chide the river for his clam'rous din;...\r\n    So numberless the songsters are that sing\r\n    In the sweet groves of that too-careless spring...\r\n    Among the rest a shepherd (though but young,\r\n    Yet hearten'd to his pipe), with all the skill\r\n    His few years could, began to fit his quill.\r\n    By Tavy's speedy stream he fed his flock,\r\n    Where when he sat to sport him on a rock,\r\n    The water-nymphs would often come unto him,\r\n    And for a dance with many gay gifts woo him.\r\n    Now posies of this flower, and then of that;\r\n    Now with fine shells, then with a rushy hat,\r\n    With coral or red stones brought from the deep\r\n    To make him bracelets, or to mark his sheep.'\r\n\r\n    W. BROWNE: _Britannia's Pastorals_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Cease.]\r\n\r\nTavistock is a quiet little 'ancient borough,' which at the first glance\r\nfrom the hill to the north-west suggests the early-Victorian word\r\n'embowered,' for it looks as if the rudiments of the town had arisen in\r\nthe midst of a large wood. The town lies chiefly in a hollow, and the\r\ntrees that cover the sides surround and encroach upon the streets in the\r\npleasantest way, and their foliage, the hills on every side, and the\r\nrushing Tavy through the midst, give an un-townlike air that is\r\ncharming. But to imagine, from this rustic and very still look, that the\r\nplace lacked history, would be to make a great mistake. On the contrary,\r\nits history starts in such very early days that only a few scattered\r\nrelics remain to show the wave of human life that passed over the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nBetween A.D. 240 and the latter half of the sixth century, the Irish\r\nmade many invasions, overran the South and West of England, and settled\r\ncolonies in parts of Devon and Cornwall, more especially along their\r\nnorthern coasts. Mr Baring-Gould, in a most interesting paper, sketches\r\nout the various descents and settlements, and traces them by their stone\r\nmonuments and by the names of the Irish saints that they left in\r\nchurches and villages and holy wells. Some of the invaders established\r\nthemselves near Tavistock, and tokens of them have been found in the\r\nneighbourhood in the shape of three stones bearing inscriptions--one in\r\nOgham characters. The stones are now in the Vicarage garden. 'On one,\r\nwhich is over seven feet high, occurs a name, probably of a Sept or\r\ntribe in Kerry, where several stones inscribed with the same name are\r\nfound. On the third are the words: \"Dobunii Fabri fili Enabarri....\"\r\nDobun was a _faber_, or smith. In Celtic organizations every _tuatha_,\r\nor tribe, had its chief smith.... Dobunii ... is the Latin for the\r\ngenitive Douvinias, also a Kerry name.... Here, then, we have written\r\nand engraven in stone for our learning the record of an Irish settlement\r\nfrom Kerry in the neighbourhood of Tavistock.'\r\n\r\nMr Baring-Gould further mentions briefly the different tribes and\r\npeoples that have invaded and possessed themselves of the land, to be in\r\nturn conquered by new-comers, and the eventual, amalgamation of races,\r\nand quotes Professor Sullivan to the discomfiture of those who\r\nrhapsodize over the 'pure Celt' in Great Britain or Ireland--for, after\r\nall, it was Irish colonists and conquerors who 'gave their name to\r\nScotland, and at one time occupied the coast of Wales and 'West\r\nDomnonia.'\r\n\r\nProfessor Sullivan writes: 'The Irish tenants of to-day are composed of\r\nthe descendants of Firbolgs and other British and Belgic races;\r\nMilesians ... Gauls, Norwegians, Anglo-Saxons, Anglo-Normans, and\r\nEnglish.... This is a fact which should be remembered by those who\r\ntheorize over the qualities of the \"pure Celt,\" whoever they may be.'\r\nThere are many amateurs whose views would be less tedious if they could\r\nbe convinced by Professor Sullivan.\r\n\r\nThe memory of one Irish saint clung for centuries to Tavistock, for the\r\nabbey was dedicated jointly to St Mary the Holy Virgin, and to St Rumon,\r\nan Irish missionary who came over to Cornwall. The abbey has\r\nunfortunately been totally destroyed, and various buildings now stand on\r\nits site. The old chapter-house was pulled down by a certain Saunders,\r\n'of barbarous memory,' 'to make way for a modern house now called the\r\nBedford Hotel.' The refectory is used as a Unitarian chapel, and still\r\nkeeps its fine pinnacled porch. A ruined tower covered with ivy, called\r\nBetsy Grimbal's Tower (a young woman was supposed to have been murdered\r\nin it), stands in grounds close by, and the other chief fragments still\r\nto be seen are the monks' still-house, a little bit of the abbey church\r\nwall, and the remains of a battlemented wall following the line of the\r\nriver. The north gateway is the most perfect remnant and that has been\r\nrestored. Of the religious houses in the Diocese of Exeter this\r\nmonastery was the most important, and it eclipsed them all by 'the\r\nextent, convenience, and magnificence of its buildings.' Orgar, Earl of\r\nDevon, founded it in 961, and Ordulph, his son, completed it on such a\r\ngrand scale, that there was room for one thousand inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe abbey had only stood for about thirty years, when a frightful blow\r\nfell: the Danes burst upon the country, harrying it with fire and sword.\r\nThey landed in Cornwall, and here Egbert hastened with his army and\r\ndefeated them at Hingston Down; but a great horde broke away, and\r\ncrossing the border descended on Tavistock, where the inhabitants in a\r\nbody rose to meet them and a terrible battle was fought. Its deadly\r\nnature is summed up with great directness in an old jingle:\r\n\r\n    'The blood which flowed down West Street\r\n    Would heave a stone a pound weight.'\r\n\r\nThe abbey was robbed and then burned to the ground. No time, however,\r\ncan have been lost in rebuilding it, for about thirty years later\r\nLivingus, the Abbot, was made Bishop of Devonshire, and was specially\r\nchosen by King Canute to accompany him on his pilgrimage to Rome.\r\n\r\nTavistock was a Benedictine monastery, over which forty abbots ruled in\r\nsuccession. Some of the later ones were noted for their lack of\r\ndiscipline--even to the point of allowing the monks 'to affect the\r\nfashionable costume of the times, adopting the secular buttoned hoods\r\nand beaked boots'; but the earlier abbots were both pious and learned,\r\nand one of the earliest printing-presses set up in England was owned by\r\nthe abbey. The first statutes of the stannaries that ever were printed\r\nwere printed here: a 'Confirmation of the Charter perteynynge to all the\r\ntynners wythyn the co[=u]ty of Devonshyre wyth their Statutes also made\r\nat Crockeryntorre by the whole ass[=e]t and c[=o]set of al the sayd\r\ntynners'--of the date 1510. In very early days the abbots were 'lessees\r\nof the Devonshire stannaries ... and controllers of the issues of royal\r\nmines in Devon and part of Cornwall,' says Dr. Oliver.\r\n\r\nAt the Dissolution the King presented the abbey and most of its estates\r\nto the Earl of Bedford. The first trace of this great family in\r\nDevonshire that I have been able to find is a lawsuit in regard to\r\ncertain lands, between John Russell and Rohesia his wife and Henry de\r\nPomeroy, which took place in the reign of King John. But there was a\r\nmuch closer connection with the county in later days. Unfortunately,\r\nspace makes it impossible to touch on more than a few of the most\r\nstriking events in the career of John Russell, first Earl of Bedford, to\r\nwhom the Abbey was granted.\r\n\r\nOn January 11, 1506, the Archduke Philip of Austria was driven by a\r\nviolent storm to take shelter at Weymouth, where Sir Thomas Trenchard,\r\nGovernor of the Coast, hurried to receive him, and to offer such\r\nentertainment as he could provide. It so happened that there was staying\r\nwith Sir Thomas a young cousin lately returned from his travels, who\r\ncombined great 'skill in foreign languages ... with his sprightly\r\nconversation and polite address.' The Archduke was enchanted to find\r\nsomeone better acquainted with his speech and customs than the\r\nstay-at-home squires who surrounded him, and when he set out for Windsor\r\nhe would not leave Mr Russell behind. To the King the Archduke praised\r\nhis protégé in glowing words, and he was given a small post at Court.\r\nNature had favoured him at the start, for he is said to have been of 'a\r\nmoving beauty that ... exacted a liking if not a love from all that saw\r\nhim' and to this valuable gift was added that of a 'learned discourse\r\nand generous deportment.'\r\n\r\nOn the accession of Henry VIII, he won the good-will of the young King\r\nby the zeal with which he threw himself into 'the dance, the Masque, the\r\npagent, the tourney,' in which Henry himself delighted; and he soon had\r\na chance for distinguishing himself in serious matters. In 1513 he\r\naccompanied the King in his campaign in France, and on the march an\r\nunusually large cannon was 'overturned in a lagoon.... Impatient to\r\nsignalise himself by some intrepid exploit, Mr Russell had the boldness\r\nto attempt its recovery, in the face of ten thousand French,' and 'with\r\nbut two hundred and fifty adventurers under him as resolute as himself,\r\nhe succeeded in the effort.'\r\n\r\nIn 1517 Mr Russell was appointed Deputy-Governor of Tournay; in 1532 he\r\nwas knighted after taking part in a descent on the coast of Brittany,\r\nand in later years he rose to positions of great and greater importance.\r\nWhen Henry was supporting the Constable de Bourbon against his\r\nSovereign, Francis I, Sir John was entrusted with the dangerous mission\r\nof conveying a huge sum of money through a country where many were well\r\naffected to the French King.\r\n\r\nOne of his first steps was to leave his company at a town on the\r\nfrontier with orders to spread the news that he was ill, whilst he\r\nhastened without escort and with the money--Henry had promised the Duke\r\nde Bourbon 100,000 crowns a month--to Geneva. Here he heard the\r\ncomforting news that the Swiss and Frenchmen were so certain of robbing\r\nhim that they had already 'lotted every of the captains his portion of\r\nthe said money.' With great speed and secrecy he caused it to be 'packed\r\nin bales, trussed with baggage, as oats or old clothes, to make it\r\nbulky, and nicked with a merchant's mark.' As a further precaution he\r\nbegged the help of the Duke of Savoy, who eventually allowed muleteers\r\nin his service to hire mules as if for his own use to take it across the\r\nmountains, and 'so bruit it to be carried as his stuff unto the Duchess\r\nhis wife.' Arrived at Chambéry, the secret of the bales was allowed to\r\nleak a very little, and Sir John, knowing that there were 'divers\r\nambushes and enterprises set for to attrap me,' set out again with his\r\nbales towards Geneva. Out of sight of the town he altered his course for\r\nMont Cenis. And this expedient was in itself a blind, for two or three\r\ndays before Sir John's departure the treasure had been sent very\r\nsecretly on other mules to Turin, where it arrived safely. He finishes\r\nhis account with conscious simplicity: 'Which ways was occasion, as I\r\nthink the said enterprises to fail of their purpose.'\r\n\r\nSir John met with many very exciting adventures, of which perhaps the\r\nmost interesting is one that happened to him at Bologna, for here he was\r\nvery skilfully rescued from an unpleasant position by the great Thomas\r\nCromwell, then a practically unknown soldier. Sir John was passing\r\nthrough the town, when he was very treacherously stopped and surrounded\r\nin his hotel by the municipal authorities. Cromwell managed to persuade\r\nthem that he was a Neapolitan acquaintance of Sir John, and that if he\r\nmight speak to him he would be able to induce the knight to surrender\r\nhimself into their hands. But what he actually did was to suggest to Sir\r\nJohn that he should change clothes with a servant that Cromwell had\r\nbrought with him, and in this disguise he helped him to escape from the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nWhen Cromwell came to England, it was Sir John who first commended him\r\nto Wolsey's notice.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Charles I, William, Lord Russell (afterwards Earl of\r\nBedford), and Pym, the great commoner, were returned together as\r\nco-members for Tavistock; and when war was declared the Earl of Bedford\r\nsided with the Parliament and was appointed to raise the Devonshire\r\nMilitia for them. He was not personally hostile to the King but thought,\r\nlike others, that if Charles saw the Parliament in arms against him, he\r\nwould realize that the nation was resolute in defence of its liberty.\r\nThe Earl of Bedford, at the head of his recruits, engaged the enemy near\r\nSherborne Castle, and was victorious; and at the battle of Edge Hill he\r\n'was reported by Lord Wharton to have done extraordinary service.' Later\r\nhe was among those most anxious for a treaty of peace, but he suffered\r\nfrom holding too moderate views. In taking up arms against the King he\r\nhad offended the Queen too bitterly to be well received when he, in\r\ncompany with some other peers, went to the Court at Oxford, and his\r\nsympathy with the King alienated him from the Parliament. Sincerely\r\nanxious for peace, he soon saw the hopelessness of all efforts in that\r\ndirection, and long before the struggle was over he practically withdrew\r\nfrom public affairs.\r\n\r\nTavistock's greatest glory, Sir Francis Drake, has already been spoken\r\nof; but among the lesser lights is a Captain fully worthy to have sailed\r\nin the company of Queen Elizabeth's illustrious Captains, though he\r\nlived in the less triumphant days of Charles I. Captain Richard Peeke,\r\nor Peke, or Pike (he signs himself Peeke in his pamphlet, but in a\r\nprivate letter Dr. Meddus, a contemporary, refers to him as Pike), has\r\nleft no account of his career, only that of his great adventure in\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nA local schoolmaster hails him with these flamboyant lines:\r\n\r\n    'Search whither can be found again the like\r\n    For noble prowess to our Tav'stock Pike,--\r\n    In whose renowned, never-dying name\r\n    Live England's honour and the Spaniard's shame.'\r\n\r\nIn 1625 Peeke joined the force that King Charles and Queen Henrietta\r\nhelped to start from Plymouth. Sir Edward Cecil was in command, and, as\r\na result of this expedition, earned for himself the nickname of\r\nSit-Still. Peeke's account is excellent, although he begins by saying\r\nthat he knows not 'the fine Phrases of Silken Courtiers'; but 'a good\r\nShippe I know and a poore Cabbin and the language of a Cannon ... as my\r\nBreeding has bin Rough (scorning Delicacy) so must my Writings be.'\r\n\r\nThe first attack was made on 'Cales' (Cadiz), and Peeke gives a vivid\r\ndescription of the hot and stubborn fight that took place before the\r\nfort of Puntal surrendered. The whole army was then landed, but Peeke\r\ndid not go with them; 'for I was no Land Soldier, and therefore all that\r\nwhile kept aboard.' As the fate of the expedition has nothing to do with\r\nhis story, it is enough to say that the men got very much out of hand,\r\nthe Commander, in great alarm, hurriedly retreated, and, without\r\nattempting to follow up his victory on land, set sail in pursuit of a\r\nSpanish fleet that he never came up with, and three weeks later returned\r\nin disgrace to England.\r\n\r\nTo return to Richard Peeke. After the army had all landed he thought\r\nthat 'the late storms had beaten all the Spaniards in' for a time, and\r\nthat he would go on shore for a little diversion. Meeting some\r\nEnglishmen coming back to the ships, laden with 'Oranges and Lymons'\r\nwhich they had taken from some gardens not far off, he set off to find\r\nsome fruit for himself, the men assuring him that there was no danger.\r\nLess than a mile away, however, he came, '(for all their talking of no\r\ndanger), on Three Englishmen starke dead, being slayne, lying in the\r\nway,' and another 'not fully dead.... I then resolved (and was about it)\r\nfor Christian Charities sake, and for Countries sake, to have carried\r\nhim on my back to our Shippes, farre off though they lay.... But my good\r\nintents were prevented; for, on a sodaine, came rushing in vpon me a\r\nSpanish Horseman, whose name as afterwards I was informed was Don Juan\r\nof Cales, a Knight.... Five or sixe Skirmishes wee had, and for a pretty\r\nwhile fought off and on.' As the fight went on Peeke got the better of\r\nDon Juan, who 'fell on his knees and crying out in French to me,\r\n_Pardone moy, je vous pree. Je suie un buon Chrestien_.... Having a\r\nSoldier's minde to Rifle him, I searched for jewels, but found only five\r\nPieces of Eight about him.' Here Fortune turned, for 'fourteen Spanish\r\nMuskateers, spying me so busy about one of their Countreymen,' came to\r\nhis rescue, and Peeke was forced to yield himself prisoner. 'True Valour\r\n(I see) goes not aluaies in good Cloathes, for Don Juan (when my hands\r\nwere in a manner bound behind me) ... wounded me through the Face, from\r\nEare to Eare, and had there killed me, had not the fourteen Muskateers\r\nrescued me from his Rage.'\r\n\r\nPeeke was again severely wounded while being led through the streets of\r\nCadiz, but met with better treatment in prison, though his forebodings\r\nwere gloomy. And when he was soon afterwards sent for by the Governor to\r\nXeres, he went 'wondrous unwilling ... because I feared I should ther be\r\nput to Tortures.' On the day of trial he was brought before a great\r\nassembly of nobles, 'my sword lying before them on the table. It was\r\nreached to me; I tooke it and embraced it in mine arms, and with teares\r\nin my eyes kist the Pommel of it. He [the Duke of Medina] then demanded\r\nhow many men I had kild with that Weapon? I told him, if I had kild one,\r\nI had not bene there now before that Princely Assembly, for when I had\r\nhim at my foote, begging for mercy, I gave him Life, yet he then very\r\npoorely did me a mischiefe. Then they asked Don John (my Prisoner) what\r\nWoundes I gave him; He sayd, None: Upon this he was rebuked and told,\r\nthat if upon our first Encounter, he had run me through, it had been a\r\nfaire and Noble Triumph; but so to wound me, being in the hands of\r\nothers, they held it Base.' Peake was now questioned as to the name of\r\nhis ship, the Captain, and the number of cannon on board. 'I sayd, forty\r\nPeices. But the Lords, looking all this while on a Paper which they held\r\nin their hands, Duke Medyna sayd, In their note there was but\r\nthirty-eight.' He afterwards found that in that paper they had every\r\ndetail about 'our Shippes, their Burden, Men ... as perfect as wee\r\nourselves had them in England. Of what strength (quoth another Duke) is\r\nthe Fort of Plymouth? I answered, very Strong. What Ordnance in it?\r\nFifty, sayd I. That is not so, sayd he, there is but seuenteene. How\r\nmany Soldiers are in the Fort? I answered, Two hundred: That is not so\r\n(quoth a Conde), there is but twenty.\r\n\r\n'Marquesse Alquenezes asked me, of what strength the little Island was\r\nbefore Plymouth. I told him, I know not; Then (quoth he), wee doe.\r\n\r\n'Is Plymouth a Walled Towne? Yes, my Lords. And a good Wall? Yes, say I,\r\na very good Wall: True, sayd a Duke, to leape ouer with a Staffe. And\r\nhath the Towne, sayd the Duke of Medyna, strong Gates? Yes. But, quoth\r\nhe, there were neither Wood nor Iron to those Gates, but two dayes\r\nbefore your Fleete came away.' Among many other questions, they asked\r\nwhy 'in all this Brauery of the Fleete the English had not taken Cales\r\nas well as Puntal?' To which Peeke, who must have often asked this\r\nquestion of himself, replied boldly that 'the Lord Generall ... was\r\nloath to rob an Almeshouse, hauing a better Market to goe to. Cales, I\r\ntold them, was held Poore, unmanned, unmunitioned. What better market?\r\nsayd Medyna. I told him Genoa or Lisbon.'\r\n\r\nAll around stood the 'Common People,' who made the ordeal still harder\r\nby 'many jeerings, mockings, scornes, and bitter jests' against the\r\nEnglish, 'which I must not so much as bite my lippe against, but with an\r\ninforced patient care stood still.... Amongst many other raproches and\r\nspightfull Names, one of the _Spaniards_ called _English_ Men _Gallinas_\r\n(Hennes).' This amused the 'Great Lords,' and one of them asked the\r\nprisoner if the Spaniards, when they came to England (in war), would\r\nprove such hens as the English. To which Peeke answered, 'somewhat\r\nemboldned by his merry countenance,' that they would prove chickens.\r\n'Darst thou then (quoth Duke of Medyna, with a browe half angry) fight\r\nwith one of these Spanish Pullets? O my Lord! sayd I, I am a Prisoner,\r\nand my life at stake, and therefore dare not be so bold as to adventure\r\nupon any such Action, ... Yet ... with all told him, he was unworthy of\r\nthe Name of an English Man, that should refuse to fight with one Man of\r\nany Nation whatsoever. Hereupon my Shackells were knockt off and my Iron\r\nRing and Chayne taken from my Neck.'\r\n\r\nThe first challenger was quickly disposed of. 'I was then demanded, If I\r\ndurst Fight against an other? I told them my heart was good to\r\nadventure; but I humbly requested them to giue me pardon if I refused.\r\nFor to my selfe I too well knew that the Spaniard is Haughty, Impatient\r\nof the least affront: And when he received but a touch of any Dishonour,\r\nDisgrace or Blemish (especially in his owne Countrey, and from an\r\nEnglish man) his Revenge is implacable, mortall and bloudy.\r\n\r\n'Yet being by the Noblemen pressed agen and agen to try my Fortune with\r\nan other, I (seeing my Life was in the Lyon's paw, to struggle with\r\nwhome for safety there was no way but one, and being afrayd to displease\r\nthem) sayd: That if their Graces and Greatnesses would giue me leave to\r\nplay at mine owne Countrey Weapon called the Quarter Staffe, I was then\r\nready there an Oposite, against any Commer.' When a 'hansome and well\r\nSpirited Spaniard steps foorth, with his Rapier and Poniard,' Peeke\r\nexplained that he 'made little account of that One to play with, and\r\nshould shew them no Sport.\r\n\r\n'Then a second (Arm'd as before) presents himselfe; I demanded if there\r\nwould come no more? The Dukes asked, how many I desired? I told them,\r\nany number under sixe. Which resolution of mine, they smiling at, in a\r\nkind of scorne, held it not Manly ... to worry one Man with a Multitude.\r\n\r\n'Now Gentlemen, if here you condemne me for plucking (with mine owne\r\nhands) such an assured danger upon mine head: Accept of these Reasons\r\nfor excuse.\r\n\r\n'To dye, I thought it most certaine, but to dye basely, I would not: For\r\nThree to kill One had bin to mee no Dishonour; To them (Weapons\r\nconsidered) no Glory: An Honourable Subjection I esteemed better, than\r\nan Ignoble conquest.... Only Heaven I had in mine eye, the Honor of my\r\nCountry in my heart, my Fame at the Stake, my Life on a narrow Bridge,\r\nand death before and behind me.'\r\n\r\nWith a supreme effort Peeke succeeded in killing one of his opponents\r\nand disabling the other two. Then for a moment he feared the threatening\r\nanger of the crowd, but the nobles showed great generosity in their\r\nadmiration of his pluck, whether they felt mortified or not, and he was\r\ntreated with extreme kindness, both then and afterwards. He 'was kept\r\nin the Marquesse Alquenezes House, who one day ... desired I would sing.\r\nI willing to obey him (whose goodnesse I had tasted), did so, and sung\r\nthis Psalme: _When as we sate in Babylon, etc._ The meaning of which\r\nbeing told he saide to me, _English_ Man, comfort thyself, for thou art\r\nin no Captivity.'\r\n\r\nPeeke was then sent to the King of Spain, who tried to keep him in his\r\nservice, but with a becoming gratitude for the favours shown to him,\r\nPeeke begged to be allowed to return home, 'being a Subject onely to the\r\nKing of England.' Whereupon the King very magnanimously gave 'one\r\nhundred Pistoletts to beare my charges.'\r\n\r\nA play has been written called 'Dick of Devonshire,' in which the\r\nadventures of 'Dick Pike' are set in the midst of a Spanish\r\ntragi-comedy.\r\n\r\nNothing is known of Peeke's life after he came back to his own country,\r\nbut there are strong reasons for believing that he returned to\r\nTavistock. And if it was himself, and not a namesake, who flourished\r\nthere, in 1638, our hero might be seen in an entirely new rôle, for that\r\nyear Richard Peeke filled the peaceful office of people's churchwarden!\r\n\r\nTavistock's fine church is dedicated to St Eustachius, and it has a high\r\nbattlemented tower crowned with slender pinnacles. The tower is 'pierced\r\nwith arches in all four sides, so that it stands on piers. It is thus a\r\ntrue campanile, and was never joined to the church.' There are monuments\r\nto several families in the nave and chancel, and stories and memories\r\ncrowd especially round two of them. One is the tomb of John Fitz of\r\nFitz-ford and his wife, at the back of which their son Sir John kneels\r\nat a desk with a book before him.\r\n\r\nFitzford House is close to Tavistock, and with the property came to Sir\r\nJohn's daughter, Lady Howard, round whose name many tales have gathered.\r\nIn Mrs Bray's time Lady Howard was regarded as 'a female Bluebeard,' but\r\na later verdict is more charitable, and it is now thought that the\r\nunhappy lady has been much maligned. Being a great heiress, her hand was\r\ndisposed of when she was only twelve years old, and she was married to\r\nSir Alan Percy, who died three years afterwards. There is a proverb--\r\n\r\n    'Winter-time for shoeing,\r\n    Peascod-time for wooing;'\r\n\r\nbut Lady Howard must have been wooed at all seasons. One month after her\r\nhusband's death she escaped from her chaperon, and secretly married Lord\r\nDarcy's son, who only survived a few months. When she was hardly\r\nsixteen, she found a third husband in Sir Charles Howard, by whose name\r\nshe is always known, although after his death she married Sir Richard\r\nGrenville. Her last 'venture,' as Prince calls it, was a very wretched\r\none; Sir Richard treated her abominably, and she retaliated to the worst\r\nof her power. After her death, Mrs Bray says (in that delightful\r\nstorehouse of local traditions, 'The Borders of the Tamar and the\r\nTavy'), there arose a belief that she was 'doomed to run in the shape of\r\na hound from the gateway of Fitzford to Okehampton Park, between the\r\nhours of midnight and cock-crowing, and to return with a single blade of\r\ngrass in her mouth whence she started; and this she was to do till every\r\nblade was picked, when the world would be at an end.'\r\n\r\n'Dr Jago, the clergyman of Milton Abbot, however, told me that\r\noccasionally she was said to ride in a coach of bones up the West Street\r\ntowards the Moor.... My husband can remember that, when a boy, it was a\r\ncommon saying with the gentry at a party, \"It is growing late; let us be\r\ngone, or we shall meet Lady Howard as she starts from Fitzford.\"'\r\n\r\nA still more conspicuous monument in the church is connected with the\r\nother tragedy. The family of Glanvills had long been settled near\r\nTavistock, and the figure is of Judge Glanvill in his robes. At his feet\r\nkneels a life-size figure of his wife. 'Her buckram waist, like armour,\r\nsleeves, ruff, and farthingale are all monstrous; and her double-linked\r\ngold chains are grand enough for the Lord Mayor. On the whole she looks\r\nso very formidable, that thus seen stationed before the Judge, she might\r\nbe considered as representing Justice herself, but it would be in her\r\nseverest mood.'\r\n\r\nThe mournful story is that of another member of the family, Eulalia\r\nGlanvill, who was forced against her will to marry an old man named\r\nPage, when she was in love with a young man, George Strangwich. After\r\nmuch misery, she and Strangwich agreed to murder Page, and the story is\r\ntold in several ballads, in one of which there is a ring of sincerity\r\nwhich makes the 'verses sound better to the brain than to the ear.' It\r\nis now thought that the ballad was written by Delaney, but in the early\r\neditions the ballad was attributed to Mrs Page herself, and a copy in\r\nthe Roxburghe Ballads is headed: 'Written with her owne hand, a little\r\nbefore her death.' 'The Lamentation of Master Page's Wife' was sung to\r\nthe tune of 'Fortune my Foe':\r\n\r\n    'Unhappy she whom Fortune hath forlorne:\r\n    Despis'd of grace, that proffered grace did scorne!\r\n    My lawlesse love hath lucklesse wrought my woe;\r\n    My discontent content did ov'rthrow.\r\n\r\n    'In blooming yeares my father's greedy mind,\r\n    Against my will, a match for me did find;\r\n    Great wealth there was, yea, gold and silver store;\r\n    And yet my heart had chosen long before.\r\n\r\n    'On knees I prayde they would not me constraine,\r\n    With teares I cride, their purpose to refraine;\r\n    With sighs and sobs I did them often move.\r\n    I might not wed, whereas I could not love.\r\n\r\n    'But all in vaine my speeches still I spent.\r\n    My Father's will my wishes did prevent;\r\n    Though wealthy Page possest my outward part,\r\n    George Strangwidge still was lodgèd in my heart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    'Lo! here began my downfall and decay!\r\n    In mind I mus'd to make him straight away,\r\n    I, that became his discontented wife,\r\n    Contented was he should be rid of life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    'Well could I wish that Page enjoy'd his life\r\n    So that he had some other to his wife;\r\n    But never could I wish, of low or hie,\r\n    A longer life, and see sweet Strangwidge die.\r\n\r\n    'You Parents fond that greedy-minded be,\r\n    And seek to graffe upon the golden tree,\r\n    Consider well, and rightfull Judges be,\r\n    And give your doome 'twixt Parents' love and me.\r\n\r\n    'I was their child, and bound for to obey,\r\n    Yet not to wed where I no love could lay;\r\n    I married was to much and endless strife,\r\n    But faith before had made me Strangwidge wife.\r\n\r\n    'You Denshire Dames and courteous Cornwall Knights\r\n    That here are come to visit woefull wights,\r\n    Regard my griefe, and marke my wofull end,\r\n    And to your children be a better friend.\r\n\r\n    'And then, my deare, which for my fault must dye,\r\n    Be not afraid the sting of death to try;\r\n    Like as we liv'd and lov'd together true,\r\n    So both at once, we'll bid the world adue.'\r\n\r\n'The Lamentation of George Strangwidge' many times lapses into bathos,\r\nbut as in a way it answers the other ballad, I will quote a few verses:\r\n\r\n    'O Glanfield! cause of my committed crime,\r\n    Snarèd in wealth, as Birds in bush of lime,\r\n    What cause had thou to beare such wicked spight\r\n    Against my Love, and eke my hart's delight?\r\n\r\n    'I would to God thy wisdome had been more,\r\n    Or that I had not ent'red at the door;\r\n    Or that thou hadst a kinder Father beene\r\n    Unto thy Childe, whose yeares are yet but greene.\r\n\r\n    'Ulalia faire, more bright than summer's sunne,\r\n    Whose beauty had my heart for ever won,\r\n    My soule more sobs to thinke of thy disgrace,\r\n    Than to behold my owne untimely race.\r\n\r\n    'The deed late done in heart I doe lament,\r\n    But that I lov'd, I cannot it repent;\r\n    Thy seemely sight was ever sweet to me.\r\n    Would God my death could thy excuser be.'\r\n\r\nKilworthy House, which in those days belonged to the Glanvills, is now\r\nthe property of the Duke of Bedford.\r\n\r\nTavistock seems to have maintained an open mind, or perhaps was forced\r\ninto keeping open house, during the Civil War; but Fitzford House, then\r\nbelonging to Sir Richard Grenville, held out resolutely for the King,\r\nuntil overpowered by Lord Essex. The people seem to have been rather\r\nindifferent to the cause of the war, and very sensible of its hardships,\r\nfor it was here suggested that a treaty might be made, 'whereby the\r\npeace of those two counties of Cornwall and Devon might be settled and\r\nthe war removed into other parts.' It was a really excellent method of\r\nshifting an unpleasant burden on to other shoulders, but in actual\r\nwarfare, unfortunately, impracticable, although the treaty was drawn up\r\nand for a short time a truce was observed.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this year (1645) Prince Charles paid a visit to the town,\r\nand was so much 'annoyed by wet weather, that ever after, if anybody\r\nremarked it was a fine day, he was wont to declare that, however fine it\r\nmight be elsewhere, he felt quite sure it must be raining at Tavistock.'\r\nOne cannot help wondering if his courtiers kept to English tradition of\r\nperpetually speaking of the weather.\r\n\r\nTo walk away from Tavistock along the Tavy's bank is to follow the\r\nfootsteps of that river's special poet, William Browne. His poems are\r\nnot so well known as they might be, and his most celebrated lines are\r\nnearly always attributed to Ben Jonson--I mean the fine epitaph on\r\n'Sidney's sister, Pembroke's mother'--though any doubt as to the author\r\nof the lines is cleared up by a manuscript in the library of Trinity\r\nCollege, Dublin. Not very many details of his life are known, but he had\r\nthe happiness of being better appreciated by his contemporaries than by\r\nposterity, and Ben Jonson and Michael Drayton wrote complimentary\r\nverses, as a sort of introduction to volumes of his poems when they were\r\npublished. Browne's work is very uneven, many of his poems are charming,\r\nsome diffuse and rather poor; but he had a sincere feeling for Nature,\r\nand his nymphs and swains revelled in posies and garlands in the shade\r\nof groves full of singing birds.\r\n\r\nIn the third book of his long poem, 'Britannia's Pastorals,' there is a\r\nquaint and pretty song, of which one verse runs:\r\n\r\n    'So shuts the marigold her leaves\r\n    At the departure of the sun;\r\n    So from the honeysuckle sheaves\r\n    The bee goes when the day is done;\r\n    So sits the turtle when she is but one,\r\n    And so all woe, as I, since she is gone.'\r\n\r\nA deliciously whimsical touch marks his description of a feast of\r\nOberon:\r\n\r\n    'The glasses, pure and thinner than we can\r\n    See from the sea-betroth'd Venetian,\r\n    Were all of ice, not made to overlast\r\n    One supper, and betwixt two cowslips cast.\r\n    A prettier hath not yet been told,\r\n    So neat the glass was, and so feat the mould.\r\n    A little spruce elf then (just of the set\r\n    Of the French dancer or such marionette),\r\n    Clad in a suit of rush, woven like a mat,\r\n    A monkshood flow'r then serving for a hat;\r\n    Under a cloak made of the Spider's loom:\r\n    This fairy (with them, held a lusty groom)\r\n    Brought in his bottles; neater were there none;\r\n    And every bottle was a cherry-stone,\r\n    To each a seed pearl served for a screw,\r\n    And most of them were fill'd with early dew.'\r\n\r\nNow and again in his verses there peeps out a joyful pride in his\r\ncounty, and his love of the Tavy is deep to his heart's core.\r\n\r\nSome way below Tavistock is Buckland Abbey, founded by Amicia, Countess\r\nof Devon, in 1278, and for long years the home of Cistercians. At the\r\nDissolution the Abbey was granted for a small sum to Sir Richard\r\nGrenville (grandfather of the hero of the _Revenge_), who altered it\r\ninto a dwelling-house. Sir Richard, his grandson, sold it to John Hele\r\nand Christopher Harrys, who were probably acting for Sir Francis Drake,\r\nand he formally bought it of them ten months later. The house was built\r\nin the body of the church, and it is still easy to trace its\r\necclesiastical origin from some of the windows and architecture. In the\r\nhall is a fine frieze, with raised figures in high relief and an\r\nelaborate background, the subject a knight turned hermit. The knight,\r\nwearing a hermit's robe, is sitting beneath spreading boughs, and a\r\nskull is lodged in a hollow of the tree-trunk. His charger and his\r\ndiscarded armour lie near him. In the same hall rests the famous drum\r\nthat went round the world with Drake, the drum referred to in the\r\ntraditional promise that Mr Newbolt has put into verse:\r\n\r\n    'Take my drum to England, hang it by the shore;\r\n    Strike it when the powder's running low;\r\n    If the Dons sight Devon, I'll quit the port of Heaven,\r\n    An' drum them up the Channel, as we drummed them long ago.'\r\n\r\nA short distance below the Abbey, the Tavy, now broadened into a wide\r\nbut still shallow stream, ripples and hurries over the pebbles in a deep\r\nvalley between wooded hills. Returning to Tavistock and going up the\r\nriver, one arrives at the pretty and very remote village of Peter Tavy.\r\nThe houses are scattered about in an irregular group, a stream runs\r\nthrough them to join the Tavy, and just above the wide bridge the brook\r\ndivides, flowing each side of a diamond-shaped patch, green with long\r\ngrass and cabbages. A steep slope leads up to the little church, which\r\nstands back, and a tiny avenue of limes leads up to it from the\r\nlichgate. The tower is battlemented, and the church must have been\r\npartly rebuilt, for parts of it are early English and the rest late\r\nPerpendicular. Within are slender clustered columns, supporting wide\r\narches, and different designs are sculptured on the sides of the granite\r\nfont.\r\n\r\nClose by is a glen, which Mrs Bray says, 'I have ventured to name the\r\nValley of Waterfalls, on account of the vast number of small but\r\nexquisitely beautiful falls seen there.' A narrow lane with high hedges\r\nleads round the shoulder of the hill to the steep little valley, where\r\nthe Tavy jostles against obstructive boulders, and a high, narrow,\r\nunstable-looking bridge of tarred timber (sometimes called a 'clam'\r\nbridge) crosses the stream. Climbing up on the farther side, the road\r\nsoon reaches the village of Mary Tavy. In reference to these villages a\r\nvery old joke is told of a Judge unacquainted with these parts who, in\r\ntrying a case, not unnaturally confused the names with those of\r\nwitnesses, and ordered that Peter and Mary Tavy be brought into court.\r\nMary Tavy has not the unusual attractiveness of Peter Tavy. It looks\r\nbarer, and is overshadowed by that peculiarly comfortless air always\r\ngiven by chimneys or machinery of mines. The church stands above the\r\nroad, and beside it a large old tree, whose lower branches are so\r\nabundantly covered with polypody that the fronds hang like long fringes\r\nfrom either side of each branch. The porch has a white groined ceiling,\r\ncrossed with fragments of the old timber roof, on which are bosses\r\ncarved in different designs.\r\n\r\nFrom Mary Tavy a road runs nearly parallel to the river. Beyond Horndon\r\nthe houses are fewer and more scattered, and somehow there is a\r\nsuggestion that one is coming nearer and nearer to the verge of\r\ncivilization. The few houses look nice in themselves, with the exception\r\nof a farm, so cheerless and neglected-looking, that it was a surprise to\r\nfind it inhabited; and not far beyond this house the road reaches\r\nanother and very different farm, looking full of comfort--and goes no\r\nfarther. This farm has the significant name of Lane End, and one\r\nrealizes from its solitary, exposed position that the high and\r\nsubstantial wall surrounding it was built for sound reasons. It stands\r\non the moor, and the cultivation is of the roughest kind; the fields,\r\nsuch as they are, being plentifully sprinkled with huge boulders. In\r\nwinter, when there is much fear of snow, these fields serve as an\r\nenclosure for the ponies that are driven-in off the moor--looking like\r\nwild animals in their long, hanging, furry coats. The river is heard\r\ndashing over the rocks below, and about a mile farther on is Tavy\r\nCleave.\r\n\r\nThe last time I saw it a vague threat hung over everything, adding a\r\ncold fascination to the moor. The hills showed tints of faint green and\r\npalest brown, and patches of bracken gave a consoling shade of russet.\r\nHare Tor rose beyond, silent and impressive, covered with snow. The Tavy\r\nhad a new beauty, for it was almost frozen over, and the dark water, and\r\nalong whirling scraps of foam, showed between the blocks of ice and\r\nsnow, and the boulders were each bordered with shining white. The sky\r\nwas heavy with snow-clouds, and beneath them and in the rifts were\r\nstormy red sunset tints, while a cold blue-grey mist was creeping up the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nThere are some places--the Castle of Elsinore, for instance--that seem\r\nto have an amazing and incomprehensible gift of resisting civilization.\r\nThey may be brought up to date, and trimmed, and filled with\r\ninappropriate people, and everything else done that should spoil them,\r\nbut in spite of it all they do not for a moment look as if any modern\r\nextraneous objects had a meaning for them. They belong to their own day\r\nand its manner, and to no other.\r\n\r\nThe same sort of feeling hovers about Tavy Cleave, and a great sense of\r\nthe mystery that here more, there less, broods over the moor. But there\r\nis no suggestion as to who it is that the moor has most truly and\r\nabsolutely belonged to, nor even the region of time: only the feeling\r\nthat the valley is, in a finer than the usual sense, haunted.\r\n\r\nAs a valley Tavy Cleave is very beautiful, with its steep sides and\r\nclear rushing stream and red granite rocks, half in and half out of the\r\nriver, that have a charm they entirely lose when once away from the\r\nwater. Mr Widgery shows how admirable they are in their proper place,\r\nwith their reflections quivering beneath them. Sometimes a kind of black\r\nmoss grows upon them, and tiny bits of white lichen, giving together a\r\ncurious tortoiseshell look. Above, the hill-sides are covered with\r\nheather and broom and whortleberries among masses of loose rocks, and\r\nnow and again there is the vivid green of a patch of bog. The great\r\nmasses of rocks crowning the separate points on the hill-side, like\r\nruined rock-castles, add to the air of mystery.\r\n\r\nLooking to the west from above the Cleave, one sees--as from any\r\ndistance round one sees--the most characteristic height of Brent Tor,\r\nwith the tiny church on the top. It is not that the tor is so very high,\r\nbut in some astonishing way it always seems to appear as a landmark,\r\nnorth, south, east, or west, when one imagines it to be absolutely out\r\nof range. The sides are steep and rocky, and the church stands 'full\r\nbleak and weather-beaten, all-alone as it were, forsaken, whose\r\nchurchyard doth hardly afford depth of earth to bury the dead; yet\r\ndoubtless they rest there as securely as in sumptuous St Peter's until\r\nthe day of Doom.'\r\n\r\nThe story told of the church is that a man once almost gave himself up\r\nfor lost--some say in a storm, others in an impenetrable, unending\r\nfog--in the Channel, and vowed that, if he ever came safe to shore, he\r\nwould build a church on the first bit of land he saw. As Brent Tor is\r\nfar inland, the fog story sounds the more probable, for there is no\r\nsaying how mist wreaths may drift. The church is dedicated to St Michael\r\nde la Rupe, and here another tradition comes in, for it is popularly\r\nsupposed that, when the building of the church was begun, the devil\r\npulled away all the day's work in the night. At last St Michael came to\r\nthe rescue, and hurled such an enormous mass of rock upon the devil that\r\nhe fled away and hindered no more. The building is very tiny, and a\r\ncountryman told me that as a child he used to be puzzled by the cryptic\r\nwarning: 'If you get into the second aisle of Brent Tor Church, you will\r\nnever get out again.' Of course--there is no second aisle.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of many of the places on the banks of the Tamar is\r\ncelebrated. Among the exquisite woods and lawns of Endsleigh--through\r\nwhich one Duke of Bedford cut no less than forty miles in rides--the\r\nriver twists and winds for a long distance at one point, and curves\r\nround almost into a ring. A little farther south are Morwell Rocks,\r\nwhich Mr Norway had the good fortune to see in the spring. 'The trees\r\nstretch far away along the river, dense and close to the water's edge, a\r\nmountain of gold and sunny green, broken in the midst by a high grey\r\ncrag, which stands up sheer and grey amid the mass of gorgeous colour.\r\nThis is the first peak of a great range of limestone cliffs, which for\r\nthe most part, as the hill sweeps round above the village of Morwellham,\r\nare hidden in the woods. But when that tiny cluster of cottages and\r\nwharves is left behind, the stream creeps closer to the hill, and it is\r\nas if the buried rock stirred and flung the coppice off its shoulders,\r\nfor the limestone precipices rise vertically out of the water to a vast\r\nheight. The summits are weathered into most fantastic shapes, pinnacles\r\nand towers break the skyline, and wherever a crevice in the rock has\r\nallowed the lodging of a little earth, some oak-tree roots itself, or a\r\nwild tangle of greenery drops down the scarred surface of the cliff.'\r\n\r\nA little farther down, the Tamar and the Tavy join, and with the Cornish\r\nLynher form the Hamoaze--a view of land and water that is very\r\nadmirable. It is not a scene whose dimly realized charm grows gradually\r\nstronger, but one whose triumphant beauty is beyond dispute. The\r\ninnumerable creeks and inlets, the rich abundance of foliage and\r\npasture, and the sweeping sense of spaciousness from the open sea that\r\ncomes off Plymouth Sound, help to make the grand effect; and the\r\nfeelings of few can be quite unstirred by the battleships, or perhaps\r\nblack sinister destroyers, and the multitude of other shipping lying at\r\nanchor in that famous haven, and by the thought of all that they mean to\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nThe Taw and the Torridge\r\n\r\n    'Hither from my moorland home,\r\n    Nymph of Torridge, proud I come;\r\n    Leaving fen and furzy brake,\r\n    Haunt of eft and spotted snake ...\r\n    Nursling of the mountain sky,\r\n    Leaving Dian's choir on high,\r\n    Down her cataracts laughing loud,\r\n    Ockment leapt from crag and cloud,\r\n    Leading many a nymph, who dwells\r\n    Where wild deer drink in ferny dells....\r\n    Græcia, prize thy parsley crown;\r\n    Boast thy laurel, Cæsar's town;\r\n    Moorland myrtle still shall be\r\n    Badge of Devon's Chivalry!'\r\n\r\n    KINGSLEY: _Westward Ho!_\r\n\r\n'All who have travelled through the delicious scenery of North Devon\r\nmust needs know the little white town of Bideford, which slopes upwards\r\nfrom its broad tide-river paved with yellow sands, and many-arched old\r\nbridge, where salmon wait for autumn floods, toward the pleasant upland\r\nin the west. Above the town the hills close in, cushioned with deep\r\noak-woods, through which juts here and there a crag of fern-fringed\r\nslate; below they lower and open more and more on softly rounded knolls\r\nand fertile squares of red and green, till they sink into the wide\r\nexpanse of hazy flats, rich salt-marshes, and rolling sand-hills, where\r\nTorridge joins her sister Taw, and both together flow quietly toward the\r\nbroad surges of the bar and the everlasting thunder of the long Atlantic\r\nswell.'\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to imagine that there could be a more fitting\r\ndescription of Bideford than that drawn in the opening words of\r\n'Westward Ho!' Bideford, it has been said, is spoilt by ugly modern\r\nhouses, but the remark implies a matter-of-fact view, for the ugliness\r\nand modernness are only skin-deep, and can easily be ignored. A matter\r\nof far greater importance is that there is an old-world essence, a\r\ndignity in the whole tone and spirit of the town, that keep it in touch\r\nwith the glorious past.\r\n\r\nFaithful followers of the heroes on the borderland of myth--King Arthur,\r\nCharlemagne, Holger Danske--believed that in their country's need these\r\nwould arise from the shades to lead their people to victory; and at\r\nBideford one feels that, should any 'knight of the sea' return, he would\r\nfind a town not strange to him, and, if the stress were sharp enough to\r\npierce the thin husk that later civilization has added, a people who\r\nwould understand and not fail him.\r\n\r\nThe name comes from By-the-ford, but a ford between East-the-water and\r\nthe town must have been rather perilous, and only possible at low-tide.\r\nIn the early part of the fourteenth century some of the chief\r\ninhabitants resolved to build a bridge, but several efforts were made in\r\nvain, for they were always thwarted by failure to find a firm enough\r\nfoundation. Then Sir Richard Gurney, priest of the place, was\r\n'admonished by a vision ... to begin that excellent work ... where he\r\nshould find a stone fixed in the ground.' This dream he thought nothing\r\nof, 'until, walking by the river, he espied such a stone or rock there\r\nrolled and fixed firmly, which he never remembered to have seen\r\nformerly,' and was hereby convinced 'that his dream was no other than an\r\nheavenly inspiration.' The whole neighbourhood combined to help, the\r\nrich sending money and lending the services of their workmen, and the\r\npoor giving such time and labour as they could afford. The bridge, which\r\nhas since been widened, is a very fine one, of twenty-four arches.\r\nWestcote says: 'A bark of 60 tons (without masts) may pass and repass\r\nwith the tide, which flows near five miles above it.'\r\n\r\nGifts and bequests were made to the bridge, and the funds belonging to\r\nit became so large, and the business connected with them so important,\r\nthat in 1758 a hall was built for the use of the feoffees, and decorated\r\nwith the royal arms and the arms of the bridge.\r\n\r\nSt Mary's Church was built about the same date as the bridge, but about\r\nforty years ago all but the tower was pulled down and rebuilt. It had\r\nsuffered considerably from the ravages of the Reformers, whose horror of\r\nritualism reached the point of throwing the font out of doors, whereupon\r\n'one schismatic,' more crazy than the rest, took it, says Watkins, in\r\nwrath, 'for the purpose of a trough for his swine to feed out of; and if\r\nhe had had his deserts, he would have made one of their company.' The\r\nfont was probably rescued by some pious person, for the one now in the\r\nchurch is a fine Norman one, with cable moulding.\r\n\r\nIn this church was baptized 'Raleigh,' the Indian brought back by Sir\r\nRichard Grenville from Carolina, and called after the great Sir Walter,\r\nwho was doing much for that country. Sir Richard kept 'Raleigh' in his\r\nown house, and the dark stranger must have caused great chattering and\r\nexcitement among the children and some of their elders in the town, but\r\nhe did not survive transplantation, and a year later was buried in\r\nBideford Churchyard. In the register he is described as a native of\r\nWynganditoia.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the church is the tomb of Thomas Grenville, who\r\nlies in armour, with a dog--not, as on most monuments, at his feet, but\r\nby his side. On the tomb are various coats of arms, and over it rises an\r\narch ornamented with high stone tracery. A curious screen between the\r\ntower and the church has been made from the old carved bench-ends. Most\r\nof the subjects are grotesque, and on some of the panels are gnome-like\r\nheads, with long beards, big hats, and impudent, leering expressions.\r\n\r\nIn the churchyard is a tombstone with this epitaph:\r\n\r\n    'Here lies the body of Mary Sexton,\r\n    Who pleased many a man, but never vex'd one,\r\n    Not like the woman who lies under the next stone.'\r\n\r\nNowadays there is not much foreign trade, although a few vessels with\r\noutlandish names may be seen lying stranded at low-water alongside the\r\nquay. But Bideford had a full share of the prosperity that Devonshire\r\nports enjoyed in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. The merchants were\r\nencouraged by Sir Richard Grenville, who, fired by the 'gallant and\r\ningenious' Sir Walter Raleigh, ventured first fortune and then himself\r\nin commanding an expedition planned by his friend and kinsman. The\r\nexpedition did not meet with great success in its main object, which was\r\nto establish a colony for the settlers, who, finding insurmountable\r\nhardships and difficulties, were all brought home later by Sir Francis\r\nDrake; but a Spanish treasure-ship of immense wealth was captured on the\r\nway back. It was said that in different ventures 'Bideford, in\r\nconsequence of its lord, had some share, but chiefly with respect to its\r\nmariners.' So, after Sir Richard had fought his splendid last fight, and\r\nwhen his immediate influence was gone, independent merchants and\r\nmariners went on to fresh enterprises, and commerce continued to\r\nincrease. Trading with Spain for wool soon became an important branch,\r\nbut of still greater consequence was the trade with Newfoundland. When\r\nWilliam and Mary reigned, Bideford was sending more ships there than any\r\nother port in the kingdom but London and--strange to say--Topsham. In\r\nthe next reign the merchants suffered immense losses from French\r\nprivateers, who, making the island of Lundy their headquarters, spied\r\nalmost every ship that passed up and down the Bristol Channel. To them,\r\nBideford or Barnstaple Bay was 'emphatically the Golden Bay, from the\r\ngreat number of valuable prizes which they captured on it.' Traffic with\r\nAmerica had, however, greatly declined, before it was killed by the War\r\nof Independence.\r\n\r\nIn the history of Bideford the name of Grenville shines on many\r\noccasions. Both Devon and Cornwall claim this eminent family, their\r\n'chiefest habitation' of Stow being in Cornwall, while, according to\r\nsome authorities, their first dwelling-place in this part of the world\r\nwas at Bideford.\r\n\r\nRichard de Grenville, near the end of the fourteenth century, for his\r\nvalour and courage in the Welsh wars was awarded the town and county of\r\nNeath, in Glamorgan. Being pious as well as brave, he devoted all this\r\nwealth to the Church, building and endowing a monastery for Cistercian\r\nmonks. A quaint 'prophecy' regarding this family was said to have been\r\nfound many years later in the Abbey of Neeth, where it was kept 'in a\r\nmost curious box of jett, written in the year 1400.'\r\n\r\nIt begins:\r\n\r\n    'Amongst the trayne of valiant knights\r\n    That with King William came,\r\n    Grenvile is great, a Norman borne,\r\n    Renowned by his fame;\r\n    His helmet ras'd and first unlac'd\r\n    Upon the Cambrian shore,\r\n    Where he in honour of his God\r\n    The Abbey did decore\r\n    With costly buildings, ornaments,\r\n    And gave us spatious lands,\r\n    As the first-fruits which victory\r\n    Did give into his hands.'\r\n\r\nWatkins refrains from any comment as to the genuineness of the\r\n'prophecy' (of which I have only quoted a small portion), but perhaps\r\nthe critical would gather from the whole tone, and especially from the\r\nclosing lines, which have a flattering reference to the reign of a King\r\nCharles, that it was written about the date of its discovery.\r\n\r\nThe dignity and authority, the commanding presence of Sir Richard as a\r\ncountry gentleman, a neighbour, a Justice of the Peace, are admirably\r\nsuggested in 'Westward Ho!' Apart from warfare on land or sea, he\r\ninterested himself in a host of affairs at home, and was both member of\r\nparliament and High Sheriff for Cornwall. He was also called to serve on\r\nCommissions for making inquiries about pirates and strengthening the\r\ndefences of the coast; and notes show that within six months he was\r\noccupied with places as far east and west as Dover and Tintagel.\r\n\r\nIn 1587 he was appointed by the Queen to review the 'trained bands' in\r\nDevon and Cornwall, that nothing of their equipment might be lacking\r\nwhen the expected enemy arrived; and when the shattered remnants of the\r\nArmada were straggling down the Irish Channel, Sir Richard had special\r\norders to 'stay all shipping upon the north coast of Devon and\r\nCornwall.' The catalogue alone of the tasks allotted to him shows how\r\ngreatly the Queen confided in his powers and judgment; yet all the tale\r\nof his life is completely overshadowed by the magnificence of his\r\ndeath:\r\n\r\n    'And he sailed away from Flores till the Spaniard came in sight,\r\n    With his huge sea-castles heaving upon the weather-bow.\r\n        \"Shall we fight or shall we fly?\r\n         Good Sir Richard, tell us now,\r\n         For to fight is but to die!\r\n    There'll be little of us left by the time this sun be set.\"\r\n    And Sir Richard said again: \"We be all good Englishmen;\r\n    Let us bang those dogs of Seville, the children of the devil,\r\n    For I never turned my back upon Don or devil yet.\"\r\n    Sir Richard spoke and he laughed, and we roared a hurrah, and so\r\n    The little Revenge ran on sheer into the heart of the foe,\r\n    With her hundred fighters on deck, and her ninety sick below;\r\n    For half of their fleet to the right and half on the left were seen,\r\n    And the little _Revenge_ ran on through the long sea-lane between.\r\n\r\n               *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    And the sun went down and the stars came out far over the summer sea,\r\n    But never a moment ceased the fight of the one and the fifty-three.\r\n    Ship after ship, the whole night long, their high-built galleons came,\r\n    Ship after ship, the whole night long, with her battle-thunder and\r\n      flame;\r\n    Ship after ship, the whole night long, drew back with her dead and her\r\n      shame.'\r\n\r\nWhen the day dawned, 'all the powder of the _Revenge_ to the last\r\nbarrell was now spent, all her pikes broken, fortie of her best men\r\nslaine, and the most part of the rest hurt.' Then Sir Richard 'commanded\r\nthe maister Gunner, whom he knew to be a most resolute man, to split and\r\nsinke the ship; that thereby nothing might remaine of glorious victorie\r\nto the Spaniards; seeing in so manie houres fighte with so great a Navie\r\nthey were not able to take her, having had fifteene houres time,\r\nfifteene thousand men, and fifty and three suite of menne of warre to\r\nperform it withall.'\r\n\r\nThe Captain and most of the crew felt that this supreme sacrifice was\r\nnot required of them, and offered to treat with the Spaniards, who,\r\nfilled with generous admiration for the amazing courage that had been\r\nshown by their adversaries, offered honourable terms of surrender. Sir\r\nRichard, who had received several wounds, and who was at the point of\r\ndeath, was carried on board the Spanish Admiral's ship, where his life\r\nebbed away within a few days. 'Here die I, Richard Grenville, with a\r\njoyful and quiet mind, for that I have ended my life as a true soldier\r\nought to do that hath fought for his country, Queen, religion, and\r\nhonour: My soul willingly departing from this body, being behind the\r\nlasting fame of having behaved as every valiant soldier is in his duty\r\nbound to do.'\r\n\r\nSir Richard's famous grandson, Sir Bevil Grenville, was a brave soldier,\r\nbut less awe-inspiring; 'the most generally beloved man in Cornwall,'\r\naccording to Clarendon; and he adds that 'a brighter courage and a\r\ngentler disposition were never married together.' When war was declared,\r\nvolunteers flocked to his standard, and in his first engagement, near\r\nLiskeard, he inflicted defeat on the Parliamentary troops, and took\r\ntwelve hundred soldiers and all the guns.\r\n\r\nAt Stratton his achievements were even more brilliant, for his troops\r\nbegan at a serious disadvantage. The enemy, with ample supplies and\r\nammunition, were encamped on the top of a hill; 'the Royalist troops,\r\nless than half their number, short of ammunition, and so destitute of\r\nprovisions that the best officers had but a biscuit a day, lay at\r\nLaunceston.' Undaunted by these discouraging conditions, they determined\r\nto attack, and having marched twenty miles, the soldiers arrived at the\r\nfoot of the hill, weary, footsore, and exhausted from want of food. From\r\ndawn till late afternoon the storming-parties were again and again\r\nrepulsed, till their powder was almost gone; then they scaled the hill\r\nin the face of cannon and muskets, to take the position by the force of\r\nswords and pikes. Grenville's party was the first to struggle up to the\r\ntop, and it was almost immediately joined by the other columns, when the\r\nenemy broke in confusion and fled.\r\n\r\nSir Bevil met his death at Lansdowne, when, with grim doggedness, the\r\nRoyalists were again climbing the heights in the face of the enemy's\r\nfire. Very many fell, and he among them. 'Young John Grenville, a lad of\r\nsixteen, sprang, it is said, into his father's saddle, and led the\r\ncharge, and the Cornishmen followed with their swords drawn and with\r\ntears in their eyes, swearing they would kill a rebel for every hair of\r\nSir Bevil's head.'\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to follow the careers of others of his family, but a\r\nsaying in the West Country ran: 'That a Godolphin was never known to\r\nwant wit, a Trelawney courage, or a Grenville loyalty.' Their love of\r\nadventure perhaps descended from an earlier Sir Richard Grenville, who\r\nputs forward his views in a poem called\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR RICHARD GRENVILLE'S FAREWELL.\r\n\r\n[Also entitled 'In Praise of Seafaring Men in Hope of Good Fortune, and\r\ndescribing Evil Fortune.']\r\n\r\n    Who seeks the way to win renown,\r\n      Or flies with wings of high desert,\r\n    Who seeks to wear the laurel crown,\r\n      Or hath the mind that would aspire--\r\n    Let him his native soil eschew,\r\n    Let him go range and seek a new.\r\n\r\n    Each haughty heart is well content\r\n      With every chance that shall betide--\r\n    No hap can hinder his intent;\r\n      He steadfast stands, though fortune slide.\r\n    The sun, quoth he, doth shine as well\r\n    Abroad as erst where I did dwell.\r\n\r\n               *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    To pass the seas some think a toil;\r\n      Some think it strange abroad to roam;\r\n    Some think it grief to leave their soil,\r\n      Their parents, kinsfolk, and their home.\r\n    Think so who list, I take it not;\r\n    I must abroad to try my lot.\r\n\r\n               *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    If Jason of that mind had been,\r\n      The Grecians, when they came to Troy,\r\n    Had never so the Trojans fooled,\r\n      Nor ne'er put them to such annoy;\r\n    Wherefore, who list to live at home,\r\n    To purchase fame I will go roam.\r\n\r\nDirectly, Bideford suffered very little from the Civil War. In the early\r\ndays the town was for the Parliament, and two forts were built, one on\r\neach side of the river; but after a defeat near Torrington, in the\r\nautumn of 1643, the citizens surrendered to the royal army. 'Their\r\nspirit for rebellion was considerably reduced,' says their special\r\nhistorian; 'they remained perfectly neutral to the dreadful end of that\r\nunhappy war.'\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it is not possible here to dwell upon the delightful\r\nminor annals of Bideford, such as the history of that stalwart\r\npamphleteer, Dr Shebbeare, who, for his repeated attacks on the\r\nMinistry, was condemned to stand in the pillory at Charing Cross. The\r\nsentence was carried out, but not exactly in the usual manner, for 'Mr\r\nBeardmore, the under-sheriff, being a friend of the Doctor's, permitted\r\nhim to stand unconfined on the platform of the pillory, attended by a\r\nservant in livery holding an umbrella over him.' It is lamentable that\r\nthe authorities were sufficiently vindictive and small-minded to visit\r\nthis act of friendly tolerance on Mr Beardmore with a fine of £50 and\r\ntwo months' imprisonment. Dr. Shebbeare was also imprisoned; but later\r\nin life the tide turned, and the King was persuaded to pension him with\r\n£200. As Dr Johnson was pensioned about the same time, with the same\r\nsum, the joke ran that the King had shown benevolence to a He Bear and a\r\nShe Bear.\r\n\r\nIt is also impossible to do more than touch on the tragic episode of\r\n1682--the trial of three unhappy women, Susanna Edwards, Temperance\r\nLloyd, and Mary Trembles, who were accused of having practised\r\nwitchcraft. Here are a few fragments of the evidence given at the trial.\r\nA witness said that, while nursing a sick woman, a magpie fluttered once\r\nagainst the window, and that Temperance admitted that this 'was the\r\nblack man in the shape of a bird.' Another time 'a grey or braget cat'\r\nof rather mysterious movements was an object of suspicion, and\r\nTemperance was reported to have confessed that 'she believed it to be\r\nthe Devil.' The evidence of a dead woman was brought forward, she having\r\n'deposed that the said Temperance had appeared to her in the shape of a\r\nred pig.' Susanna Edwards, under strict examination, 'confesseth that\r\nthe Devil hath appeared to her in the shape of a Lyon, as she supposed.'\r\n\r\nSome of the questions put to the wretched 'witches' were simply\r\ngrotesque, and reflect, as Watkins caustically observes, on the\r\nintelligence of the examiner. Temperance was asked:\r\n\r\n'Temperance, how did you come in to hurt Mrs Grace Thomas? Did you pass\r\nthrough the key-hole of the door, or was the door open?...\r\n\r\n'H. [the examiner]. Did you know any Marriners, that you or your\r\nAssociates destroyed, by overturning of ships or boats?\r\n\r\n'TEMPERANCE. No! I never hurt any ship, bark, or boat in my life.\r\n\r\n'H. You say you never hurt ships nor boats; did you never ride over an\r\narm of the sea on a Cow?'\r\n\r\nTo the north of Bideford is a little peninsula formed by the mouth of\r\nthe Torridge on the east, the far wider estuary of the Taw on the north,\r\nand the open sea on the west. The whole course of the Torridge is very\r\ncapricious. The source is within four miles of the sea, not far south of\r\nHartland, and, at once turning inland, the stream takes a south-easterly\r\ndirection till it reaches the first slopes that, rising out of the\r\nfertile country, mount gradually as they stretch towards the borders of\r\nDartmoor. At this check the Torridge runs due east till, within a few\r\nmiles of Okehampton, it turns in a great rounded loop, and flows north\r\nand slightly west to the north coast again.\r\n\r\nThe Taw's course is far more direct. It rises in Dartmoor, and,\r\noccasionally bending slightly to east or west, it makes a fairly\r\nstraight way towards the north till Barnstaple is reached, and then,\r\nturning almost at a right angle, runs westward to the sea.\r\n\r\nFollowing the strip of land along the west bank of the Torridge from\r\nBideford, the road passes Northam, and on the north-eastern point, at\r\nthe meeting of the rivers, stands Appledore. Before reaching Northam, by\r\ndiverging a little to the west, one arrives at the remains of an ancient\r\ncastle, Kenwith Castle, known for a long time as Hennaborough or Henny\r\nHill, where about A.D. 877 the Danes were valiantly driven back, after\r\na furious battle, by King Alfred and his son. Hubba, the leader of the\r\nDanes, fell, and their magical banner, Reafan--the Raven--was taken.\r\nAccording to one tradition, it was 'wrought in needlework by the\r\ndaughters of Lothbroc, the Dane, and, as they conceived, it made them\r\ninvincible.' Another account rather contradicts this, as it declares\r\nthat the wonderful standard bore a stuffed raven, who 'hung quiet when\r\ndefeat was at hand, but clapped his wings before victory.' All the\r\nlegends, however, point to the faith of the Danes in the magical powers\r\nof the banner, and their chagrin on losing it must have been very great.\r\n\r\nThe Danes buried Hubba 'on the shore near his ships, and, according to\r\nthe manner of northern nations, piled on him a heap of copped stones as\r\na trophy to his memorial, whereof the place took name Hubba-stone.'\r\nRisdon speaks of the 'sea's encroaching,' and of the stones having been\r\nswept away by it before his day, but the name still clings to the spot\r\nwhere it stood.\r\n\r\nA little fort at Appledore was built, it is said--but the authority is\r\nnot infallible--at the same time that the forts were thrown up at\r\nBideford, and towards the end of July, 1644, it was called on to make a\r\ndefence. Barnstaple had suddenly rebelled against the Royalists, and the\r\ncitizens resolved to take possession of the guns that commanded the\r\nriver's mouth. Sir John Berkeley, writing what must have been an\r\nunsatisfactory letter to Colonel Seymour, in answer to a request for\r\nmore men, speaks of the troops sent to help the defenders: 'Your desire\r\nand expectance of supply is most just and reasonable. Having been\r\nexhausted of men by the Prince, and having sent to the relief of\r\nAppledore, by His Majesty's command, 500 under Colonel Apsley ... I am\r\nnot able to give you the least assistance at present.' And Sir Hugh\r\nPollard, writing at the same time, mentions that Colonel Apsley's force\r\nwill meet 'a many of Doddington's horse at Chimleigh, to the relief of\r\nthe fort at Appledore, which is straitly besieged by those of\r\nBarnstaple.'\r\n\r\nThe garrison consisted of forty Cornishmen, and before the siege was\r\nraised they were 'much straitened both for dread and fresh water.' They\r\nwere particularly badly off because 'a certain colonel, who is\r\nstigmatized covertly as \"no Cornishman,\" had been entrusted with the\r\nvictualling of the fort, but had neglected his duty.'\r\n\r\nClose to the sea, on the west, lies Westward Ho!--a tiny (and modern)\r\nwatering-place, named after Kingsley's famous book. Along the western\r\nshore as far as the Taw stretch Northam Burrows, covered for some\r\ndistance by a fine elastic turf that is far-famed, and by patches of\r\nrushes. Beyond the golf-links the ground breaks into sand-hills, all\r\nhillocks and hollows of pure sand, soft and yielding, dented by every\r\nfootstep, set with rushes and spangled with crane's-bill, yellow\r\nbedstraw, tiny purple scented thyme-flowers, and a kind of spurge.\r\n\r\nBoth sand-hills and common are protected from the sea by the well-known\r\nPebble Ridge, which stretches for two miles in a straight line. It is a\r\nmass--fifty feet wide and twenty feet high--of large, smooth, rolled\r\nslate-stones, some being two feet across, though most of them are\r\nsmaller.\r\n\r\nTurning westwards along the coast, Lundy is often to be seen like a\r\nfaint blue cloud on the horizon, especially when a softening haze hovers\r\nover the land--but on a clear day it is very distinct. And on a fine\r\nevening, when the dim blue twilight is creeping up on every side, it has\r\nthe very air of an enchanted island against the radiant crimson that for\r\na few moments spreads and glows in the west after sundown.\r\n\r\nA little distance farther on is Portledge, 'the most antient seat of the\r\nname and family of Coffin,' says Prince; and he mentions a boundary deed\r\nbetween Richard Coffin and the Abbot of Tavistock, written 'in the Saxon\r\ntongue, which giveth good confirmation thereof.' Sir William Coffin was\r\none of several Devonshire gentlemen who were 'assistants' to Henry VIII\r\nin the tournaments of the 'Field of the Cloth of Gold,' being of great\r\ncourage, and 'expert at feats of arms.' A story which is often told of\r\nhim gives a good illustration of his strong will. While living on a\r\nproperty that belonged to his wife in Derbyshire, Sir William chanced\r\none day to pass a churchyard, and seeing a group of people standing\r\nabout, he asked what was happening. Being told that 'they had brought a\r\ncorps to be buried, but the priest refused to do his office unless they\r\nfirst delivered him the poor man's cow, the only quick goods left,' for\r\na burial fee, he commanded the priest to read the service. But the\r\npriest declined to do so until he had received his fee. On this answer,\r\nSir William 'caused the priest to be put into the poor man's grave, and\r\nearth to be thrown upon him; and he still persisting in his refusal,\r\nthere was still more earth thrown in, until the obstinate priest was\r\neither altogether or well nigh suffocated.'\r\n\r\nPrince is entirely delightful over this story. He goes on: 'Now, thus to\r\nhandle a priest in those days was a very bold adventure;' as if to bury\r\na priest alive was usually considered a pleasant amusement. Sir William,\r\nhowever, not only lived through the storm that the high-handed action\r\nraised, but actually succeeded in moving Parliament to pass an Act\r\nregulating the burial fees that might be asked of the poor. So our\r\nbiographer finishes with the triumphant axiom: 'Evil manners are often\r\nthe parent of good laws!'\r\n\r\nEleven miles west of Bideford is Clovelly. Here one feels, rather\r\ndespairingly, that anyone who has seen this wonderful village can listen\r\nto no description of it; while to those who have never seen it, no\r\ndescription is of any value.\r\n\r\nA road leads towards it through the Hobby, a wood overhanging the sea,\r\nwhich Kingsley describes as 'a forest wall five hundred feet high, of\r\nalmost semi-tropic luxuriance.' The road was 'banked on one side with\r\ncrumbling rocks, festooned with heath, and golden hawkweed, and London\r\npride, like velvet cushions covered with pink lace, and beds of white\r\nbramble-blossom alive with butterflies; while above my head, and on my\r\nright, the delicate cool canopy of oak and birch leaves shrouded me so\r\nclose that I could have fancied myself miles inland, buried in some glen\r\nunknown to any wind of heaven, but that everywhere between green sprays\r\nand grey stems gleamed that same boundless ocean blue.'\r\n\r\nThe village itself lies in a ravine of the rock, and the 'street' is so\r\nprecipitous that the eaves of one house are on a level with the\r\nfoundations of its next neighbour above. Kingsley and Dickens have\r\nwritten descriptions that, scarcely overlapping, seem to complete each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n'I was crawling up the paved stairs, inaccessible to cart or carriage,\r\nwhich are flatteringly denominated Clovelly street; ... behind me a\r\nsheer descent, roof below roof, at an angle of 75°, to the pier and bay,\r\ntwo hundred feet below and in front of me; another hundred feet above, a\r\ngreen amphitheatre of oak and ash and larch, shutting out all but a\r\nnarrow slip of sky, across which the low, soft, formless mist was\r\ncrawling, opening every instant to show some gap of intense dark rainy\r\nblue, and send down a hot vaporous gleam of sunshine upon the white\r\ncottages, with their grey steaming roofs and bright green railings\r\npacked one above another upon the ledges of the cliff; and on the tall\r\ntree fuchsias and gaudy dahlias in the little scraps of courtyard;\r\ncalling the rich faint odour out of the verbenas and jessamines, and,\r\nalas! out of the herring heads and tails also, as they lay in the\r\nrivulet, and lighting up the wings of the gorgeous butterflies, almost\r\nunknown in our colder eastern climate, which fluttered from woodland\r\ndown to garden, and from garden up to woodland.'\r\n\r\nThe human element tinges the other sketch more strongly:\r\n\r\n'The village was built sheer up the face of a steep and lofty cliff.\r\nThere was no road in it, there was no wheeled vehicle in it, there was\r\nnot a level yard in it. From the sea-beach to the cliff-top two\r\nirregular rows of white houses, placed opposite to one another and\r\ntwisting here and there, and there and here, rose like the sides of a\r\nlong succession of stages of crooked ladders, and you climbed up village\r\nor climbed down the village by the staves between, some six feet wide or\r\nso, and made up of sharp, irregular stones. The old pack-saddle, long\r\nlaid aside in most parts of England, as one of the appendages of its\r\ninfancy, flourished here intact. Strings of pack-horses and pack-donkeys\r\ntoiled slowly up the staves of the ladders, bearing fish and coal, and\r\nsuch other cargo as was unshipping at the pier from the dancing fleet of\r\nvillage boats and from two or three little coasting traders. As the\r\nbeasts of burden ascended laden, or descended light, they got so lost at\r\nintervals in the floating clouds of village smoke, that they seemed to\r\ndive down some of the village chimneys and come to the surface again far\r\noff, high above others. No two houses in the village were alike in\r\nchimney, size, shape, door, window, gable, roof-tree, anything. The\r\nsides of the ladder were musical with water, running clear and bright.\r\nThe staves were musical with the clattering feet of the pack-horses and\r\npack-donkeys, and the voices of the fishermen urging them up mingled\r\nwith the voices of the fishermen's wives and their many children.... The\r\nred-brown cliffs, richly wooded to their extremest verge, had their\r\nsoftened and beautiful forms reflected in the bluest water, under the\r\nclear North Devonshire sky of a November day without a cloud. The\r\nvillage itself was so steeped in autumnal foliage, from the houses\r\njoining on the pier to the topmost round of the topmost ladder, that one\r\nmight have fancied it was out a-bird's-nesting, and was (as indeed it\r\nwas) a wonderful climber.'\r\n\r\nThe harbour is very small, but on a cliff-bound, dangerous coast it is\r\none of the very few between Bideford and Padstow. Clovelly's great\r\nherring fishery used to be famous, but it is not now so large as it used\r\nto be.\r\n\r\nAbove the village, the beautiful park of Clovelly Court lies along the\r\ncliffs, looking over the wide distances of Bideford Bay; and on a fine\r\nday the Welsh coast may be seen. Inland, great forest trees tower above\r\na miniature forest of bracken, and at the opening of a glade one may\r\ncatch glimpses of the deer appearing and vanishing again.\r\n\r\nThe Carys were in very ancient days settled at St Giles-in-the-Heath,\r\nbut a branch of them came to Clovelly in the reign of Richard II. They\r\nwere of the same race as the Carys of Torre Abbey, and the family of\r\nwhom Lord Falkland is the head. John Cary, who acquired the property,\r\nwas a distinguished character. As a Judge, 'he scattered the rays of\r\njustice about him, with great splendour.' He was called to show firmness\r\nand loyalty under the most trying circumstances, but, 'true as steel ...\r\nthe greatest dangers could not affright him from his duty and loyalty\r\nto his distressed master Richard II, unto whom he faithfully adhered\r\nwhen most others had forsaken him.' When the King had been deposed,\r\n'this reverend Judge, unable and unwilling to bow like a willow with\r\nevery blast of wind, did freely and confidently speak his mind.' So\r\nfaithfully did he maintain King Richard's cause that, when Henry IV came\r\nto the throne, the Judge was banished the kingdom, and his goods and\r\nlands were confiscated. These, Sir Robert Cary, his son, recovered\r\nliterally at the point of the sword, for a 'certain Knight-errand of\r\nArragon,' of great skill in feats of arms, 'arrived here in England,\r\nwhere he challenged any man of his rank and quality.' Sir Robert\r\naccepted the challenge, and a 'long and doubtful combat was waged in\r\nSmithfield, London.' In the end the 'presumptious Arrogonoise' was\r\nvanquished, and Henry V, to whom Sir Robert's gallantry appealed,\r\nrestored him 'a good part of his father's lands,' and granted him leave\r\nto bear 'in a field silver, on a bend sable, three white roses,' the\r\narms of the conquered knight--the arms that the Carys still bear. The\r\nClovelly branch of the family is now extinct.\r\n\r\nA little to the south of Clovelly, and on high ground, are Clovelly\r\nDykes, the remains of an old camp, sometimes called British and\r\nsometimes Roman. It is large and circular, and the position was\r\nstrengthened by three great trenches, about eighteen feet deep and three\r\nhundred feet long, which lie around it. The camp commands the only old\r\nroad in the surrounding country.\r\n\r\nAbout seven or eight miles to the west is the grand headland of Hartland\r\nPoint. It is a narrow ridge that rises precipitously three hundred and\r\nfifty feet above the water, projects far out into the sea, and abruptly\r\nends the coast-line to the west. The coast is very fine, but also most\r\ndangerous, and the cliffs, cleft here and there by great chasms, fall\r\nsheer down to needle-points of hard black slate rock jutting out into\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nThe name of Herty Point, as it used to be called, was originally, says\r\nCamden, 'Hercules's promontory,' and this title has given rise to 'a\r\nvery formal story that Hercules came into Britain and killed I know not\r\nwhat giants.' Here Camden pauses in his description of the place, to\r\nconsider whether there ever was a Hercules at all, and, if so, whether\r\nthere were not really forty-three Hercules; and if this was not so,\r\nwhether Hercules was perhaps 'a mere fiction to denote the strength of\r\nhuman prudence,' or, again, possibly a myth personifying the sun, and\r\nhis labours the signs of the zodiac, 'which the sun runs through\r\nyearly.' On the whole, he decides that, at any rate, Hercules never came\r\nto Britain, but the name might have been given to the point by the\r\nGreeks 'out of vanity,' because 'they dedicated everything they found\r\nmagnificent in any place to the glory of Hercules.'\r\n\r\nFour miles south-east of the headland lies Hartland town. It has been\r\nbriefly described as 'a very quiet street of grey stone cottages and\r\nwhitewashed houses on a high and windy tableland.' Close by is Hartland\r\nAbbey, founded, according to tradition, by Githa, the wife of Earl\r\nGodwin, and mother of Harold II, in honour of St Nectan; for she 'highly\r\nreverenced the man, and verily believed that through his merits her\r\nhusband had escaped shipwreck in a dangerous tempest.' In the reign of\r\nHenry II, leave was given to Oliver de Dynant to change the community of\r\nsecular canons into regular canons of St. Augustine's order, and to\r\nfound a monastery for them. But between the successors of the founder\r\nand the canons matters did not always run smoothly; in fact, on one\r\noccasion, about a hundred years later, they actually came to blows in\r\nthe church, as is made clear by an entry in the register of Bishop\r\nBronescombe, for it records that the bishop had reconciled the church,\r\n'which had been polluted by an effusion of blood in an affray between\r\nOliver de Dinham and the canons.'\r\n\r\nAfter the Dissolution the Abbey was bestowed by the King upon the\r\nSergeant of his cellar, a man named Abbott. Parts of the Abbey remained\r\nunaltered and in good repair till the end of the eighteenth century,\r\nwhen, in building the present house, the unfortunate taste of the period\r\ndestroyed the hall, which was over seventy feet long, and a portion of\r\nthe cloisters, which were then still perfect. Parts of them, however,\r\nare still standing. The cloisters had been rebuilt at a very early\r\ndate, for Dr. Oliver quotes an inscription which was over one of the\r\narches that shows them to be the work of the Abbot John of Exeter, who\r\nresigned in 1329. Bishop Stapledon had found many defects in the\r\nstructure of the Abbey, when he made his visitation in 1319, and had\r\nordered them to be at once remedied. During the alterations made about\r\none hundred and twenty years ago, the monument of a Knight Hospitaller\r\nwas found, and within the last few years small pieces of carved stone\r\nhave been dug up--amongst others, a Madonna's head with traces of blue\r\nand gold still upon it; a monk kneeling, and a knight and lady hand in\r\nhand. The Abbey is now the property of Sir Lewis Stucley.\r\n\r\nNearer the shore, and on high ground, is the church of St Nectan, whose\r\ntall pinnacled tower is a landmark to sailors. The tower is\r\nPerpendicular, but most of the church is late Decorated, and the north\r\nside has a Norman doorway. The great feature is the very beautiful\r\nscreen which stretches across the whole church; but the cradle roofs are\r\ngood, and there is other carving. On the pulpit is the figure of a goat\r\nwith tusks, and the puzzling inscription, 'God save King James. Fines.'\r\nThe Norman font is curiously sculptured with grotesque faces that look\r\ndown on to equally quaint faces on the pedestal--an allegory in stone\r\nwhich Mr Hawker of Morwenstow interpreted as the righteous looking down\r\non the wicked.\r\n\r\nThree or four miles farther on is the actual border-line, and here one\r\nmust turn, although, looking south towards Widemouth Bay, it is\r\nirresistibly tempting to quote a few verses of rank doggerel, written on\r\na shipwreck which happened there on November 23, 1824. The verses were\r\nprobably inspired by terrible stress of emotion, and suggest the idea\r\nthat they were written with a spar rather than with a pen; but no doubt\r\nthey were for ever the joy and pride of their author.\r\n\r\n    'Come all you British seamen,\r\n    That plough the raging main,\r\n    Who fight for King and Country,\r\n    And your merchants do maintain.\r\n\r\n    I'll sing you of a shipwreck\r\n    That was here the other day,\r\n    At a place that's called Widemouth,\r\n    Near Bude, and in that bay.\r\n\r\n        _Chorus._\r\n\r\n        'So my British tars be steady,\r\n        And maintain your glorious name;\r\n        Till you're drowned, killed, or wounded,\r\n        You must put to sea again.\r\n\r\n    'The twenty-third of November,\r\n    That was the very time,\r\n    A fine and lofty schooner brig,\r\n    The _Happy Return_, of Lyme,\r\n    The bold and noble Captain\r\n    Escaped from the deep,\r\n    And died with cold that very night\r\n    Near to a flock of sheep.\r\n\r\n        _Chorus._\r\n\r\n        'So my British tars, etc.\r\n\r\n    'The mate, as fine a seaman\r\n    As could stand on a deck,\r\n    Had with his noble Captain\r\n    Escaped from the wreck;\r\n    No refuge could be found on shore.\r\n    No good could there be done;\r\n    He returned on board the deck and died:\r\n    The poor man lost his son.\r\n\r\n        _Chorus._\r\n\r\n        'So my British tars, etc.\r\n\r\n    'This poor man's son was not drown'd,\r\n    But found dead the next day;\r\n    Three only of this manly crew\r\n    Escaped death and sea.\r\n    Have pity on poor seamen,\r\n    Kind gentlemen, I beg;\r\n    The one of them is wounded,\r\n    The poor man broke his leg.\r\n\r\n        _Chorus._\r\n\r\n        'So my British tars, etc.\r\n\r\n    'I've twice myself been shipwreck'd,\r\n    Twenty-two years at sea,\r\n    But never saw a gang of thieves\r\n    Before that very day;\r\n    Had it not been for Captain Thomas,\r\n    And his loyal Preventive crew,\r\n    They'd have stolen the cargo and the deck,\r\n    The mast and rigging too.\r\n\r\n        _Chorus._\r\n\r\n        'So my British tars, etc.\r\n\r\n    'This schooner came from Dublin,\r\n    To London she was bound;\r\n    I could not believe such daring thieves\r\n    Stood on the British ground.\r\n    The Farmers of the country,[8]\r\n    That distress ought to relieve,\r\n    Some of them were stealing butter,\r\n    While others stole the beef.\r\n\r\n        _Chorus._\r\n\r\n        'So my British tars, etc.\r\n\r\n    'Seamen call this place West Barbary.\r\n    To me it does appear,\r\n    More of the cargo would have sav'd,\r\n    Were they wrecked on Algier:\r\n    The people might as well come in,\r\n    Rob the market or the fair;\r\n    But to rob distressed seamen,\r\n    No one had business there.\r\n\r\n        _Chorus._\r\n\r\n        'So my British tars, etc.\r\n\r\n    'Now to complete this shipwreck,\r\n    And for to end this song,\r\n    I've told you nothing but the truth,\r\n    No mortal I have wrong'd.\r\n    Great praise is due to Pethick.[9]\r\n    His wife and family brave,\r\n    That did their best that very time\r\n    Poor seamen's lives to save.\r\n\r\n        _Chorus._\r\n\r\n        'So my British tars, etc.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: St. Ginnes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The cottager by the seaside.]\r\n\r\nKingsley remarks that 'an agricultural people is generally as cruel to\r\nwrecked seamen as a fishing one is merciful,' and speaks of the many\r\nstories he has heard of 'baysmen' on this coast 'risking themselves like\r\nvery heroes to save strangers' lives, and at the same time beating off\r\nthe labouring folk who swarmed down for plunder from the inland hills.'\r\n\r\nRetracing the way to Northam Burrows, passing through them to their most\r\nnortherly point, and crossing the Taw, one arrives at a strip of\r\nshore--Braunton Burrows--which corresponds to the strip on the southern\r\nbank of the river.\r\n\r\n'A great chaos of wind-strewn sand-hills,' inhabited by armies of\r\nrabbits, and haunted by peewits and gulls, the Burrows are brightened by\r\nmasses of wild-flowers, from the great mullein--once known as\r\nhedge-taper, because of its pale torch of blossoms--to the tiny delicate\r\nrose-pink bells of the bog-pimpernel. 'To the left were rich, alluvial\r\nmarshes, covered with red cattle sleeping in the sun, and laced with\r\ncreeks and flowing dykes.... Beyond again [looking back to the south]\r\ntwo broad tide-rivers, spotted with white and red-brown sails, gleamed\r\nlike avenues of silver ... till they vanished among the wooded hills. On\r\nthe eastern horizon the dark range of Exmoor sank gradually into lower\r\nand more broken ridges, which rolled away, woodland beyond woodland,\r\ntill all outlines were lost in a purple haze; while far beyond the\r\ngranite peaks of Dartmoor hung like a delicate blue cloud, and enticed\r\nthe eye away into infinity.'\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the sand-dunes are the remains of a little, very old\r\nchapel, St Anne's Chapel, which is said to have been built by St\r\nBrannock. North of the Burrows the land rises into cliffs, on which grew\r\n(I hope, _grows_) the great sea-stock; and Baggy Point, at the southern\r\nend of Morte Bay, runs out into the sea. Beyond the Point, the broad\r\nyellow line of Woolacombe Sands stretches along the bay towards Morte\r\nPoint.\r\n\r\nNot far off was the manor of the Tracys, Woolacombe Tracy. A curse was\r\nbrought on this family by William de Tracy, 'first and forwardest of the\r\nknights who murdered Thomas a Becket.' For, 'the Pope banning, cursing,\r\nand excommunicating,' a '_Miraculous Penance_' was imposed on the\r\nTracys, 'that whether they go by _Land_ or _Water_, the _Wind is ever in\r\ntheir faces_.' Fuller, who gives this information, concludes dryly: 'If\r\nthis was so, it was a _Favour_ in a hot _Summer_ to the _Females_ of\r\nthat _Family_, and would spare them the _use_ of a _Fan_.' On William de\r\nTracy himself fell the special curse, that ever after his death he\r\nshould be compelled to wander at night--some say over Woolacombe Sands,\r\nothers among Braunton Burrows--till he could make a rope of sand. But,\r\nwhenever the rope is nearly woven, there comes a black dog, with a ball\r\nof fire in his mouth, and breaks it; so the penance is never at an end.\r\nShrieks and wails have been heard by people in cottages near the shore.\r\nSometimes the uneasy spirit haunts the northern landing-place of the\r\nferry from Braunton Burrows to Appledore, and a wild, long-drawn cry of\r\n'Boat ahoy!' comes ringing in the darkness over the waters. No one\r\nanswers that cry now after dusk, for once, many years ago, the ferryman,\r\nwho is well remembered among the Appledore people, went over, and no man\r\nwas there, but the black dog jumped into the boat. The ferryman, not\r\nmuch liking this, put back again as fast as he could, but when Appledore\r\nwas nearly reached the dog swamped the boat, made his way to shore, and\r\nwas lost in the shadows of Northam Burrows. 'And the boatman's nerve was\r\nso much shaken that soon afterwards he gave up the ferry.\r\n\r\nA monument to William de Tracy was wrongly supposed to lie in the church\r\nof Morthoe, or Morte, as it is more commonly called, on the north of the\r\nbay. The memorial is of another William de Tracy, rector here till his\r\ndeath in 1322. It is an elaborately sculptured altar-tomb, and bears the\r\nincised effigy of a priest; on the sides are figures of St Catherine and\r\nSt Mary Magdalene, to whom jointly the rector founded a chapel in his\r\nchurch. The church is mainly Perpendicular, but it has an Early English\r\nchancel.\r\n\r\nThe northern curve of the bay ends in Morte Point, and here is a\r\ncromlech in ruins, for the massive slab of rock which formed the\r\ncover-stone has fallen from the upright stones on which it used to lie.\r\n\r\nBeyond the point, at the end of the reef, is a huge rock called the\r\nMorte Stone, very dangerous on that exposed coast. The Normans are\r\nsupposed to have given its sinister name, and many since their time have\r\nfound it a true rock of death. No fewer than five vessels have been lost\r\nthere in one winter. Rather more than a mile to the north, Bull Point,\r\njutting out into the sea, abruptly ends the coast-line on the north; the\r\ncliffs fall back slightly, and stretch away eastward, above 'black\r\nfields of shark's-tooth tide-rocks, champing and churning the great\r\ngreen rollers into snow.'\r\n\r\nReturning to the Taw, inland, upon the eastern side of the Burrows, one\r\npasses Braunton, two or three miles short of the estuary. The most\r\ninteresting point about this village is its association with its\r\nname-saint, St Brannock--for the ancient name was Brannockstown. Old\r\nwriters rather wildly assert that the saint was the son of a 'King of\r\nCalabria,' but Mr Baring-Gould, in a rapid sketch, says that he was the\r\nIrish confessor of a King of South Wales, who, not finding happiness in\r\nthe life he was leading, migrated to North Devon. The legends that\r\nsprang up about his name are steeped in a golden haze. When St Brannock\r\narrived, the whole place was 'overspread with brakes and woods. Out of\r\nwhich desert, now named the Borroughs (to tell you some of the marvels\r\nof this man), he took harts, which meekly obeyed the yoke,' and made\r\nthem 'plow to draw timber thence to build a church, which may gain\r\ncredit if it be true.' The caution of this commendation is delightful.\r\nMore, alas! we do not learn, for the writer forbears 'to speak of his\r\ncow (which being killed, chopped in pieces, and boiling in the kettle,\r\ncame out whole and sound at his call), his staff, his oak, and his man\r\nAbel, which would seem wonders. Yet all these you may see at large,\r\nlively represented to you in a fair glass window.' It is very\r\ndisappointing that the window filled with the further wonders, the very\r\nnames of which have a charm, should have perished.\r\n\r\nSt Brannock Church is large, and, like Morte Church, is partly\r\nPerpendicular and partly Early English. It has an unusually wide\r\npanelled roof, and on one of the panels is carved a sow and some little\r\npigs--an illustration of a legend connecting the saint with the church,\r\nfor the tradition ran that he had been told in a dream to build his\r\nchurch 'wherever he should first meet a sow and her family.' A similar\r\ngroup is to be seen in the porch of the church at Newton St Cyres. Some\r\nof the bench-ends in St Brannock's Church are very beautifully carved.\r\n\r\nThe road to Barnstaple, bending to the south-east, follows the estuary\r\nof the Taw for nearly six miles.\r\n\r\nThe town is very prettily placed, but it is dominated by modern\r\nbuildings, and has not the air of antiquity with which its history might\r\nhave invested it. The river sweeps round a bend of a green and pleasant\r\nvalley just above the town, and along the strand is a walk shaded with\r\ntrees, looking over the river to a pastoral country beyond. Nearer the\r\nbridge is Queen Anne's Walk, 'an open portico near the river, called the\r\nQuay Walk, being an exchange of the merchants, etc.,' renamed when it\r\nwas rebuilt in Queen Anne's reign. From the bridge westward the scene\r\nhas an air of peaceful contentedness. Sea-gulls flutter among the\r\nsand-banks, from which 'the sea retires itself' at low-tide, leaving\r\nonly a small, shining stream, which seems 'to creep between shelves and\r\nsands.' Beyond are green marshes, and gentle rounded hills behind them\r\nlead on one from another. The country is much the same all along the\r\nriver to the sea.\r\n\r\nBideford is proud of its bridge, which is very high, and has sixteen\r\narches. Several people have been given the credit of building it, and\r\nits date is supposed to be some time during the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe church, dedicated to St Peter and St Paul, is cross-shaped, and the\r\nlead steeple looks well against the sky, especially when it is\r\nsurrounded by a shoal of swallows swooping and darting about it in all\r\ndirections. The church has been much restored, and altered from the\r\noriginal building; evidently there were once three altars in it; and a\r\npiscina still remains in the south aisle, close to the west wall of the\r\ntransept. A curious monument was erected in 1634 by Martin Blake, the\r\nVicar, to his son and four children who died very young. A heavy and\r\nelaborate framework surrounds a severe likeness of a melancholy-looking\r\nman, who is resting his head on his hand. On the monument are short\r\ndetached sentences, numbered:\r\n\r\n     '1. He was cut off in the flower of his life.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     '10. His heart on fire for the love of God.\r\n\r\n     '11. Martin Blake, the Father, was taken from the Pulpit, and sent\r\n          to Exeter jail for four years.\r\n\r\n     '12. The Pulpit empty, and the congregation waiting for him.\r\n\r\n     '13. He wishes to depart this life, and be at peace with his children.\r\n\r\n     '14. But it is necessary I should remain in the flesh for the good\r\n          of my people.\r\n\r\n     '15. He that shall endure to the end shall have a crown of life.'\r\n\r\nMr Blake suffered much during the Civil War, but I can find no record of\r\nany imprisonment beyond his being in 1657 'a prisoner at large in\r\n_Exeter_ for six weeks.' In 1646 he was petitioned against on account of\r\nhis Royalist sympathies, 'by one _Tooker_,' to whom he had shown great\r\nkindness, and who intrigued against him in the most abominable manner.\r\nThough Sir Hardress Waller wrote to the Committee of sequestrations on\r\nhis behalf, he was suspended, and as about a year later his suspension\r\nwas cancelled, the infamous Tooker very hurriedly concocted a petition,\r\nostensibly from Barnstaple, praying that the 'Discharge' might be\r\nrepealed. Walker comments on the astonishing speed with which Tooker\r\nmanaged this business. 'The Reader ... will certainly think, as I do,\r\nthat he who _walked to and fro in the Earth_, helped them to it; tho'\r\nnot in the Quality of a Courier, but in his other Capacity, that of the\r\n_Father of Lies_.' Mr Blake, however, was allowed to return to his\r\nliving, but 'not without the cumbrance of a _Factious Lecturer_,' and\r\nwas not in full possession till after the Restoration.\r\n\r\nBarnstaple asserts that it became a borough at a very early date--in\r\nfact, that it 'obtained divers liberties, freedoms, and immunities from\r\nKing Athelstan'; but whether this were so or not, the inhabitants\r\ncertainly received a charter from Henry I, and further privileges were\r\nadded by King John. The barony of Barnstaple, first granted to Judhael\r\nde Totnes, passed to the Tracys, then by marriage to the Lords Martin,\r\nand again by an heiress to the Lords Audley. The son of this heiress was\r\nthe 'heroical' Lord Audley who so greatly distinguished himself at the\r\nBattle of Poitiers.\r\n\r\nBarnstaple sent three ships to join the fleet that met the Armada.\r\nRisdon calls it 'the chief town of merchandise next the river's mouth,'\r\nand says that the people 'through traffic have much enriched\r\nthemselves,' although their haven is so shallow 'that it hardly beareth\r\nsmall vessels.' Yet spring-tides sometimes flood the marshes all round,\r\nand on one occasion some of the people 'to save their lives were\r\nconstrained from their upper rooms to take boat and be gone.' Westcote\r\nspeaks of it as trading especially with 'Spain and the islands,' and\r\ntill the latter half of the eighteenth century wool for the serge-makers\r\nfrom Ireland and America was brought to this port; but its trade has now\r\nalmost dwindled away.\r\n\r\nBarnstaple Fair is a great institution, and, though not quite the event\r\nthat it used to be, still keeps up many traditional ceremonies. On the\r\nfirst morning a large stuffed glove is put out on the end of a pole from\r\na window of the Guildhall, and is supposed to be the symbol of welcome\r\nto all comers. This sign was adopted long ago, and in the accounts in\r\n1615 and 1622 are two entries: 'Paid for a glove put out at the fair,\r\n4d.,' and 'Paid for a paire of gloves at the faire, 4d.'\r\n\r\nIn the Guildhall, toast and spiced ale are handed round in loving-cups\r\nto all comers, and after two or three speeches the Mayor and Corporation\r\nproceed to the High Cross and other places in the borough, and the Town\r\nClerk reads the Proclamation of the Fair. A 'Fair Ball' is still given,\r\nbut the custom of a stag-hunt on the second day has been dropped.\r\n\r\nBarnstaple was a sort of shuttle-cock during the Civil War. Here, as\r\nelsewhere, the citizens were not all of one mind; though the merchants\r\nand the majority were for the Parliament, and it was taken possession\r\nof first by one side and then by the other.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1643, Barnstaple and Bideford sent a combined force against\r\nthe royal troops under Colonel Digby at Torrington, but being completely\r\nrouted, their courage was shaken, and a few days later Barnstaple was\r\nsurrendered to Prince Maurice. The next year, however, most of the\r\ngarrison having been drawn away, the inhabitants arose and took\r\npossession of the town for the Parliament. Prince Maurice hurriedly sent\r\nColonel Digby to bring them to reason, but with great determination they\r\nresisted the Royal troops, who were driven back. During the next three\r\nmonths the fortunes of the Parliament in the West were at a very low\r\nebb, and in September the town was summoned by Lord Goring. The store of\r\nammunition was very low, and as soon as they were blockaded, the\r\ntownspeople found themselves short of provisions. 'At that time but\r\nweakly garrisoned, the town surrendered on terms, and the garrison\r\nquitted it on the 17th, leaving 50 pieces of ordnance.'\r\n\r\nIn the following May the Prince of Wales arrived, for, says Clarendon,\r\n'no place was thought so convenient for his residence as Barnstaple, a\r\npleasant town in the north part of Devonshire, well fortified, with a\r\ngood garrison in it, under the command of Sir Allen Apsley.' The King\r\nsent orders to the Prince, who at this time was little more than fifteen\r\nyears old, 'by the advice of his council, to manage and improve the\r\nbusiness of the West, and provide reinforcements for the army.' The\r\nPrince's council had no easy task, for they were harassed by several\r\ncauses. Lord Goring's jealousy and selfishness were a great hindrance;\r\nin consequence of a petition regarding the violence of his horse, the\r\nPrince, says Clarendon, 'writ many earnest letters to the Lord Goring.'\r\nAnother great difficulty to be grappled with here was a fierce quarrel\r\nbetween Sir Richard Grenville and the Commissioners of Devon and\r\nCornwall, who complained of him in such bitter terms, that anyone who\r\njudged from their report must have concluded him to be 'the most justly\r\nodious to both counties that can be imagined.'\r\n\r\nPrince Rupert paid the Prince a visit in June, and not long afterwards\r\nLord Goring's horse arrived in hot disorder, having been chased most of\r\nthe way from Bridgwater by Fairfax's troops. In the following spring the\r\ntown was besieged by the Parliament's troops, and the day after the\r\ntreaty for the surrender of Exeter was completed, Fairfax himself\r\nmarched to Barnstaple. The Governor, seeing that resistance was\r\nhopeless, gave 'the castle and the town ... as a security for surrender\r\nof the fort at eight days' end'; and on honourable terms Barnstaple\r\nyielded to the enemy. It was the last town in Devonshire to be delivered\r\nto the Parliament.\r\n\r\nAbout two miles upstream the river 'Taw vails bonnet to Tawstock, in our\r\nancestors' speech,' says Westcote, and he goes on to describe it as 'a\r\npleasant and delicate seat indeed, in a rich soil, and inhabited by\r\nworthy personages.' The modest claim has been put forward that the view\r\nhere includes 'the most valuable manor, the best mansion, the finest\r\nchurch, and the richest rectory, in the county.' Possibly other parishes\r\nmay not agree with all the superlatives, but the beautiful features of\r\nthe valley certainly offer a temptation to use them.\r\n\r\nTawstock Court was once the property of the Earls of Bath, and now\r\nbelongs to their descendant, Sir Bourchier Wrey. An Elizabethan gateway\r\nis all that is left of the old house, which was burnt down, and rebuilt\r\nin 1787. The beautiful cruciform church is chiefly Decorated, but parts\r\nare of a later date; it is dignified by a fine central embattled tower,\r\ncrowned by pinnacles. In the church are several altar-tombs to the\r\nBourchiers, Barons Fitzwarine and later Earls of Bath, and to their\r\nwives, and there is a very early effigy carved in wood.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Taw and crossing the country to the south, and a little to\r\nthe west, one reaches the Torridge, and Torrington, a town 'built\r\nscatteringly, lying at length, as it were, upon the brow of a hill\r\nhanging over the river.' It is, perhaps, chiefly known as the scene of a\r\nskirmish and an engagement during the Civil War. The skirmish, already\r\nmentioned, took place when the Parliament's partisans set out from\r\nBarnstaple and Bideford to attack Colonel Digby, who, with a small\r\nforce, had established himself there. It was indeed a case of fortune\r\nfavouring the bold, for the Royalists were taken unawares, and had it\r\nnot been for the daring of 'the Colonel, whose courage and vivacity upon\r\naction was very eminent, and commonly very fortunate,' the day might\r\nwell have been with the other side. Colonel Digby had divided a small\r\nnumber of horse into little parties in different fields, and was waiting\r\nfor some of his troops to join him before attacking the enemy, when a\r\nband of about fifty Parliamentary musketeers came towards the ground\r\nwhere they stood. Realizing that, if these once gained possession of the\r\nhigh banks between the two forces, his party must be driven off, Colonel\r\nDigby, with instant decision, took four or five officers with him, and\r\ncharged with such vigour that the raw country troops, smitten with\r\npanic, threw down their arms and ran, 'carrying so infectious a fear\r\nwith them, that the whole body of troops was seized by it and fled.'\r\nColonel Digby followed, with all the horse at his disposal, 'till,' says\r\nClarendon complacently, 'their swords were blunted with slaughter.'\r\nPerhaps the Royalists were more anxious to impress a salutary warning\r\nagainst the sin of rebellion than to kill the fugitives, for Clarendon\r\nfinishes the account by saying that the rebels 'were scattered and\r\ndispersed all over the country, and scarce a man without a cut over the\r\nface and head, or some other hurt, that wrought more upon their\r\nneighbours towards their conversion, than any sermon could be preached\r\nto them.' This affair practically brought about the submission of\r\nBarnstaple, Bideford, and Appledore.\r\n\r\nThe second engagement was of a far more important character, with fatal\r\nconsequences to the King's cause in the West--already in a hopeless\r\ncondition. In the early spring of 1646, Lord Hopton marched to\r\nTorrington, and was waiting there for the arrival of about half his\r\nammunition and provisions, when he heard that Sir Thomas Fairfax, with a\r\nlarge army, was in the immediate neighbourhood. To the best of his\r\npower, he hurriedly made such defences as were possible. His position\r\nwas excellent, for Torrington stands on a hill almost surrounded by deep\r\nvalleys, but his force was very inferior in numbers to that of the\r\nenemy. It is curious that the second engagement at Torrington began\r\naccidentally. Fairfax's army had had a series of encounters with an\r\noutlying troop of Royalist dragoons on approaching the town, and by the\r\ntime they drew near the day was nearly spent. As the Royalists were well\r\nprepared for their arrival, the lanes and fields near the town being\r\nlined with musketeers, the Parliamentary Generals resolved to stay at a\r\nlittle distance and wait for the morning to attack. The Royalist word\r\nfor the night was, 'We are with you,' and their sign, that each man had\r\na handkerchief tied round his right arm. The word for the other army\r\nwas, 'Emmanuel, God with us,' and their signal, a sprig of furze in\r\nevery hat.\r\n\r\nAbout nine o'clock a noise in the town suddenly awoke the suspicion that\r\nthe Royalists were retreating, so, says Sprigg, 'that we might get\r\ncertain knowledge whether they were going off or not, a small party of\r\ndragoons were set to fire on the enemy near the barricadoes and hedges;\r\nthe enemy answered us with a round volley of shot.' Whereupon the\r\nengagement became general, and both sides fought 'in the dark for some\r\ntwo hours, till we beat them from the hedges and within their\r\nbarricadoes, which were very strong, and where some of their men\r\ndisputed the entrance of our forces with push of pike and butt-end of\r\nmusket for a long time.' At length the Parliamentary troops prevailed,\r\nand their horse 'chased the enemy through the town.' Lord Hopton,\r\nbringing up the rear, had his horse shot dead under him in the middle of\r\nthe town, but, in spite of the fact that he was slightly wounded, he\r\nmade yet another effort to rally his troops, and they, 'facing about in\r\nthe street, caused our foot to retreat.' Then a body of horse dashed up\r\nwith a vehemence that the Royalists could not stand against, and they\r\nwere obliged to fly; 'one of the officers publicly reporting,' says\r\nClarendon bitterly, 'lest the soldiers should not make haste enough in\r\nrunning away, that he saw their general run through the body with a\r\npike.'\r\n\r\nScarcely were the Parliamentarians in possession of the town, when a\r\nfrightful explosion occurred. The church, which unknown to them, Lord\r\nHopton had used as a powder-magazine, was blown up and about two hundred\r\nprisoners whom the Roundheads had confined in the church were killed. In\r\nhis account of the disaster, Sprigg, who was obviously, from passages in\r\nhis writings, a man of warm feelings, and a clergyman by profession,\r\nrefers very cheerfully to the fact that 'few were slain besides the\r\nenemy's (that were prisoners in the church where the magazine was blown\r\nup), and most of our men that guarded them, who were killed and buried\r\nin the ruins,' and not for one moment does the melancholy fate of the\r\nmany victims seem to damp his joy.\r\n\r\nThe victory was a very important one, and a public thanksgiving was held\r\nin consequence--indeed, this was the last real resistance made by the\r\nRoyalists in the West.\r\n\r\nThe church has been very unfortunate, for since it was rebuilt in 1651\r\nthe tower has been blown down, and it fell through the roof, doing a\r\ngood deal of damage. An old print shows this tower to have been a\r\nwonderful erection of slates and tiles, projecting eaves, and irregular\r\ngables, surmounted by a little dome, with a weathercock on the top of\r\nall. It was replaced by a slender, tapering, but more conventional\r\nspire.\r\n\r\nMargaret, Countess of Richmond, and mother of Henry VII, lived here for\r\nsome time, and left a generous gift, for, 'pitying the long path the\r\npastor had from home to church,' she 'gave to him and his successors the\r\nmanor-house with lands thereto': and on this site of the manor-house\r\nstands the present vicarage. Besides making this gift, 'on every\r\noccasion a friend to learning, even in its infancy, she built a room for\r\na library, and furnished it with the most useful books then to be had.'\r\n\r\nTorridge Castle, a building of the fourteenth century, stood on the\r\nverge of a steep descent to the river. In Risdon's day it was almost\r\ngone, the ruins had 'for many years hovered, which, by extreme age, is\r\nalmost brought to its period;' and in 1780 the chapel, the only part\r\nleft, was partly pulled down and afterwards turned into a school.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile or so to the east stands Stevenstone--a new house, in the\r\nmidst of a fine deer-park. For over three centuries Stevenstone was\r\nowned by the Rolles, and when Fairfax's troops advanced on Torrington,\r\ntwo hundred dragoons were being entertained by 'Master Rolls,' and the\r\nadvance was disputed by these dragoons, who, after a long and straggling\r\nfight in the narrow and dirty lanes, eventually fell back on the town.\r\nHere Fairfax took up his quarters after the town had been taken.\r\n\r\nA few miles upstream the Torridge passes Potheridge, the birthplace of\r\nGeneral Monk, whose ancestors had owned property here since the reign of\r\nHenry III.\r\n\r\nThe character of George Monk is extraordinarily interesting, a curious\r\npoint being that, though he was essentially cautious, level-headed, and,\r\nas Clarendon says, 'not enthusiastical,' and therefore unlikely to rouse\r\nvery vivid sentiments in others, as a matter of fact he awoke violent\r\nfeelings either of glowing enthusiasm or of extreme bitterness. It is\r\neasy to understand his unpopularity with keen partisans who looked on\r\ntheir opponents and all their ways with abhorrence, and therefore failed\r\nto understand how an honest man could fight for the King, then accept a\r\ncommand from Cromwell, and finally become the prime mover of the\r\nRestoration. But--'If a man does not keep pace with his companions,\r\nperhaps it is because he hears a different drummer'; and it may well be\r\nthat the beat that ruled Monk's steps was the peaceable government and\r\nwelfare of the people, and especially of the army, and to the personal\r\nclaims and rights of the rulers he was indifferent. The general state of\r\nthings needed reform badly enough. Monk's acts were never inconsistent,\r\nbut he had a genius for silence. When war in England broke out, he\r\nreturned from fighting for the King in Holland, to fight for him at\r\nhome. When Cromwell offered him his release from the Tower, at the price\r\nof helping to subdue the Irish rebels, his accepting the command was to\r\nthe advantage of this country.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, Monk was forced to turn soldier with unexpected\r\nsuddenness. The Under-Sheriff of Exeter publicly affronted Sir Thomas\r\nMonk, on which his son, aged sixteen, went to Exeter and gave the\r\noffender 'the chastisement he deserved (without any intention of\r\nmurder).' This step created a good deal of disturbance, and to avoid\r\nmore, 'our young gentleman' was packed off to 'the School of War in the\r\nLow Countries.'\r\n\r\nHe was taken prisoner early in the Civil War, and after over two years\r\nof close imprisonment, agreed to accompany the Lord Deputy Lisle to\r\nMunster. After leaving Ireland he gained brilliant successes at sea over\r\nthe Dutch. Prince tells a tale that is characteristic of him and of\r\nCromwell. The seamen who had served under Monk had been told that they\r\nshould receive their full pay as soon as the prizes were sold off, but\r\nwere unreasonably impatient; and while Monk was actually at Whitehall\r\nputting their claims before the Protector, news was brought him 'that\r\nthree or four thousand seamen were come as far as Charing Cross with\r\nswords, pistols, and clubs, to demand their pay. General Monk, thinking\r\nhimself wronged in this, ran down to meet them, drew his sword, and fell\r\nupon them; Cromwell following with one or two attendants, cut and hew\r\nthe seamen, and drove them before him.' Prince finishes the story with\r\napplause of the boldness that 'should drive such great numbers of such\r\nfurious creatures as English seamen.' Later, Monk's command in Scotland\r\nresulted in a state of order and quietness then very unusual in that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAccusations of dealing unfairly with the Parliament in 1659 may be\r\nlevelled against him with some justice, but how was loyalty possible to\r\na household so divided against itself as were the rulers of the Kingdom?\r\nThe Army and the Parliament were in bitter antagonism to each other, and\r\nLambert's soldiers had shut the Parliament out of Westminster. The\r\nmembers of the Rump Parliament, the earlier 'secluded' members, the\r\nPresbyterians, the Independents under Lambert, the Royalists, and\r\nsmaller parties, were all working for their own ends. When Monk marched\r\nsouth, a deputation was sent to meet him from the Council of Officers,\r\nostensibly to make terms between their army and his, but also with the\r\nsecret object of establishing an understanding between him and Fleetwood\r\nthat would enable the latter to get rid of his friend and colleague,\r\nGeneral Lambert. Meanwhile Lambert, jealous of Fleetwood, sent a\r\nprivate and friendly message to Monk by Major-General Morgan, who not\r\nonly betrayed his party at Lambert's bidding, but betrayed that patriot\r\nas well, for at the same time that he gave the message, he also\r\ndelivered a secret letter from Lord Fairfax, begging Monk to adopt a\r\ncourse which would have been fatal to Lambert. And the country as a\r\nwhole was heartily sick of both factions.\r\n\r\nHad Monk openly declared himself for the Stuarts, at the time that he\r\nfirst began to prepare for the Restoration, he would probably have\r\nimperilled the success of the whole scheme, and most certainly would\r\nhave plunged the country again into the horrors of Civil War. When he\r\ndid reveal his negotiations with the exiled Court at Breda, 'London\r\nwould not have borne many days, or even many hours longer, the extreme\r\ntension it was then suffering--the City one way, Westminster the other\r\nway; Monk's army between them, and Fleetwood's wolves prowling all\r\nround, and ready to pour in.'\r\n\r\nApart from all else, tribute must be paid to Monk's marvellous skill in\r\nso ordering affairs that the Restoration was brought about almost\r\nwithout the cost of a drop of blood. During the winter of 1659, a far\r\nlarger army than his own lay for many weeks a few miles to the south on\r\nthe Border, sent there with the especial purpose of watching and if\r\nnecessary attacking him. But Monk knew how to bide his time and to\r\nprolong negotiations to suit his convenience till in the end, without a\r\nblow being struck, he marched his army south to London. Masterly was the\r\ndiplomacy and grasp of detail which, on the eve of announcing the\r\nRestoration, dispersed over the country all soldiers who would be\r\ninclined to stand by the Parliament, making any serious attempt at a\r\nrevolt on their part impossible.\r\n\r\nOne failing his most fervent admirer cannot ignore--a strong leaning to\r\navarice. But his popularity was unbounded, and 'it was his singular\r\nfortune to win in succession the affection of three very different\r\npopulations, those of Dublin, Edinburgh, and London.' In Ireland his men\r\nwere devoted to him. 'A soldier, tho' sick and without shoes, would\r\nstrive to go out with honest George Monk.' After the death of Cromwell\r\nhe was offered the crown, but he refused, 'holding it a greater honour\r\nto be an honest subject than a great usurper.'\r\n\r\nDuring the frightful visitation of the Plague, the Earl of Craven, and\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury and Monk, were the only high officials who\r\nstayed at their posts, and exposed themselves perpetually to the 'seeds\r\nof death.' So great was the public confidence in him, that at the time\r\nof the Great Fire, he being then at sea, 'the people did believe and\r\nsay: \"If he had been there, the city had not been burned.\"' No idol of\r\nthe mob could ask a more whole-hearted adoration.\r\n\r\nThe popular feeling is expressed in a rather limping acrostic on his\r\nname, of which I quote only the first quarter. It was called 'England's\r\nHeroick Champion, or The ever-renowned General George Monck.' The date\r\nis about 1659-60.\r\n\r\n'G ood may'st thou be, as thou are great.\r\n E ver regarded.\r\n O r like _Alexander_ compleat,\r\n R ichly rewarded.\r\n G ainst thy virtue none dare stand,\r\n E xcluded Members now are\r\n         Back return'd by thy hand.\r\n\r\n'M any miles didst thou compass,\r\n O nly us to free;\r\n N othing by thee too hard was,\r\n C ompared to be.\r\n K eep us in thy protection!\r\n         We were all greatly distrest;\r\n         Bring thou in all the best.\r\n\r\n'G reat bonfires then was made,\r\n E xpressing joy,\r\n O f us that sorrow did invade,\r\n R efresh our annoy.\r\n G uard us with thy aid, we desire;\r\n E xaltation we all will raise\r\n         Unto heaven in thy praise.\r\n\r\n'M uch good hast thou already done,\r\n O ver this land;\r\n N ow our hearts thou hast quite won:\r\n C ommand! Command!\r\n K indly we will entertain\r\n         Those that were excluded,\r\n         For they have not intruded.'\r\n\r\nIn later years, as Duke of Albemarle, he returned to the estate of his\r\nforefathers, and rebuilt Potheridge in a very magnificent manner. It has\r\nsince been pulled down.\r\n\r\nIf the traveller follows the Torridge upstream, he will be led south\r\ntill he is within two miles of Hatherleigh, and here the river curves\r\naway westwards, and then in a northerly direction. In the spring, this\r\nclear, rippling stream has a special charm--thousands and thousands of\r\ndaffodils grow along the banks though only sparingly in the fields\r\nbeyond, so that, if the river happens to be low and the water not to be\r\nseen at a little distance, the windings of the river through the wide\r\ngreen valley are marked by two broad lines of pale, clear yellow.\r\n\r\nHatherleigh Moor was given a bad name very long ago. The saying is\r\ndouble-edged:\r\n\r\n    'The people are poor, as Hatherleigh Moor,\r\n    And so they have been for ever and ever.'\r\n\r\nBut the people of the little town are able to graze their cattle and cut\r\nfurze for fuel on it. Hatherleigh parish has two holy wells. St John's\r\nWell stands on the moor, and there used to be a pretty custom of\r\nfetching its water for a baptism. The water of St. Mary's Well was good\r\nfor the eyes, and within the memory of persons still alive pagan\r\ntraditions were observed around it on Midsummer Eve. Amidst 'wild scenes\r\nof revelry ... fires were lit, feasting and dancing were indulged in.'\r\n\r\nFor some years, in this part of the country, while he was curate to his\r\nfather, who had the neighbouring living of Iddesleigh, the renowned\r\n'Jack' Russell preached on Sundays and hunted on weekdays. He was\r\nimmensely popular, and so many stories are told of him and his hounds\r\nthat it has been already said, 'Russell is fast becoming mythical.' He\r\nwas not the ideal of a modern parish priest, but this is the opinion of\r\none who remembers him. The writer begins by speaking of a friend of\r\nRussell's as a man who 'seems ... to have been as good a Christian as he\r\nwas a gentleman; not ecstatic perhaps, but in the sense of leading a\r\ngodly, righteous and sober life. And,' he goes on, 'the same may with\r\ncertainty be predicated of Russell ... Russell, like a wise man, got\r\nright home to Nature. It was not for nothing that the gipsy chieftain\r\nleft him his rat-catcher's belt, and begged for burial at his hands in\r\nSwymbridge churchyard.'\r\n\r\nPerhaps the following story of him is not quite so well known as many\r\nothers:\r\n\r\nMr Russell once advertised for a curate: 'Wanted, a curate for\r\nSwymbridge: must be a gentleman of moderate and orthodox views.'\r\n\r\nSoon after this advertisement had appeared Mr Hooker, Vicar of\r\nBuckerell, was standing in a shop door in Barnstaple, 'when he was\r\naccosted by Will Chapple, the parish clerk of Swymbridge, who entered\r\nthe grocer's shop. \"Havee got a coorate yet for Swymbridge, Mr Chapple?\"\r\ninquired the grocer, in Mr Hooker's hearing. \"No, not yet, sir,\" replied\r\nthe sexton. \"Master's nation purticler, and the man must be orthodox.\"\r\n\"What does that mean?\" inquired the grocer. \"Well, I reckon it means he\r\nmust be a purty good rider.\"\r\n\r\nHere we must leave the Torridge altogether, and go eleven miles\r\nsouth-east to the point where the Taw leaves the uplands of Dartmoor.\r\nAlmost the first village that the river passes is South Zeal, close to\r\nSouth Tawton, and near South Zeal was the old home of the Oxenhams, the\r\nfamily about whom the well-known legend of the white bird is told. When\r\nan Oxenham is about to die, a white bird flaps at the window or flies\r\nabout the sickroom, and stories of the bird having been seen at such\r\ntimes have been told at intervals, through two centuries. The evidence\r\nin some instances seems fairly good, but where an apparition is expected\r\nit is not unlikely imagination may play tricks, or a chance event may be\r\ninterpreted as an omen.\r\n\r\nLysons quotes from Mr Chapple's manuscript collections a case that\r\nhappened in 1743, the story being given to Mr Chapple by the doctor. Mr\r\nWilliam Oxenham was ill, and 'when the bird came into his chamber, he\r\nobserved upon the tradition as connected with his family, but added he\r\nwas not sick enough to die, and that he should cheat the bird, and this\r\nwas a day or two before his death, which took place after a short\r\nillness.'\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to pass over thirteen or fourteen miles, but at\r\nChumleigh one must turn aside to the east, for about six miles in that\r\ndirection was the ancient home of the Stucleys. Affeton Castle has been\r\nfor many years altogether in ruins, but in the middle of the last\r\ncentury Sir George Stucley roofed over the old gate-house and made it\r\nhabitable as a shooting-box. This is the only part of the castle still\r\nstanding, though the farmhouse close by is no doubt built upon some of\r\nthe foundations. 'Lusty Stukeley' (the name was spelt in several ways)\r\nwas far from among the worthiest of his family, but distinctly the most\r\nentertaining. His ideas were certainly 'spacious' enough for the great\r\ndays in which he lived, though he was too crack-brained and full of self\r\nto fall into line with his betters, whose deeds still bear rich fruit.\r\n'He was,' says Fuller severely, 'one of good parts, but valued the less\r\nby others, because over-prized by himself.'\r\n\r\nIf it be allowed that the personality of everyone inclines to being drab\r\nor flamboyant, his may be compared to fireworks. Thomas Stukely, who was\r\nborn about 1530, was for a younger brother unusually well endowed, 'but\r\nhis profluous prodigality soon wasted it; yet then, not anyway dejected\r\nin mind, he projected to people Florida, and there in those remote\r\ncountries to play rex.' He 'blushed not' to tell Queen Elizabeth 'that\r\nhe preferred rather to be sovereign of a mole-hill than the highest\r\nsubject to the greatest king in Christendom.' His audacity reached the\r\npoint of bandying words with the Queen, who seems, from the polite irony\r\nof her tone, to have been amused by his vanity.\r\n\r\n'I hope,' said the Queen, 'I shall hear from you when you are stated in\r\nyour Principality?' 'I will write unto you,' quoth Stuckley. 'In what\r\nlanguage?' said the Queen. He returned, 'In the stile of Princes, To our\r\ndear Sister.'\r\n\r\nAnd on this Stukely departed, but not to Florida, for he met with\r\nreverses which dashed his plans, but not his spirits. Westcote quotes 'a\r\nditty made by him, or of him,' apparently at this time:\r\n\r\n    'Have over the waters to Florida.\r\n    Farewell good London now;\r\n    Through long delays on land and seas,\r\n    I'm brought, I cannot tell how.\r\n\r\n    'In Plymouth town, in a thread-bare gown.\r\n    And money never a deal:\r\n    Hay! trixi trim! go trixi trim!\r\n    And will not a wallet do well?'\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, his career was a great failure. From sunning himself at\r\nthe Court of Elizabeth, he turned to paths of disloyalty, and became the\r\n'Pope's pensioner.' The Pope created him Marquis of Leinster, and added\r\nseveral minor titles, and then this 'Title-top heavy General' attempted\r\nin vain to carry treasonable help to the Irish rebels. Yet he had 'the\r\nfortune to die honourably.' Arrived in Lisbon at the moment when the\r\nKing of Portugal was starting in a campaign to Barbary, Stukely was\r\npersuaded to join his army, and fell, fighting gallantly, at the Battle\r\nof Alcasar, 1578.\r\n\r\n    'A Fatal Fight, where in one day was slain\r\n    Three Kings that were and one that would be fain.'\r\n\r\nAbout five miles to the north, at King's Nympton, the Pollards were\r\nsettled for some generations, and many of them 'lived to be as proper\r\ngentlemen as most in this or any other county.' Sir Hugh Pollard fought\r\nin the Civil War, and as Governor of Dartmouth Castle made a brave and\r\nresolute though unsuccessful defence. After the Restoration, Charles II\r\nappointed him Comptroller of the Household. It was said of Sir Hugh\r\n'that he was very active and venturous for his Majesty in the worst of\r\nTimes, and very hospitable and noble with him in the best.'\r\n\r\nFive miles north of Bishop's Nympton is the old town of South Molton,\r\nand the manor was part of the demesne of Edward the Confessor. In the\r\nreign of Edward I, Lord Martin held it 'by sergeantry to find a man with\r\na bow and three arrows to attend the Earl of Gloucester when he goeth to\r\nGower [in Wales] to hunt.'\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1654, Charles II was proclaimed King in South Molton,\r\nfor the Wiltshire gentlemen who had risen against the Government, headed\r\nby Sir Joseph Wagstaff and led by Colonel Penruddock and Mr Hugh Groves,\r\nmade their way so far west before they were overpowered. Sir Joseph\r\nescaped, but the other two leaders were beheaded at Exeter.\r\n\r\nA little to the north of the town, and about eight miles south of\r\nBarnstaple, are the wide grounds of Castle Hill--broad lawns and slopes,\r\nclear streams, and rich feathery masses of woodland that, shaded and\r\nsoftened by distance, spread far away.\r\n\r\nThe Fortescues, not long after the Conquest, were granted lands in\r\nDevonshire, and in one generation after another they have come forward\r\nto take a part in public affairs--often a Samson's share of toil. Sir\r\nJohn Fortescue fought at Agincourt, and was chosen Governor of Meaux by\r\nHenry V. Sir Edward Fortescue, when he had surrendered Salcombe Castle,\r\nhad the consolation of knowing that this fort had been held for the King\r\nlater than any other place in Devonshire. Sir Faithful and Sir Nicholas\r\nFortescue were distinguished commanders in the same war. In the reign of\r\nHenry VI, Sir Henry Fortescue was Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, though\r\nhis fame is very much eclipsed by the greater brilliancy of his brother.\r\n\r\nSir John Fortescue, Lord Chief Justice, is usually spoken of as Lord\r\nChancellor, though it is doubted whether he ever received a valid\r\nappointment; for when the honour was bestowed upon him, Yorkists and\r\nLancastrians were already at war. As the trouble deepened, Sir John laid\r\naside his robe for his sword, and fought bravely for the 'falling cause'\r\nin the terrible battle of Palm Sunday. Later, he accompanied the King\r\nand Queen in their flight, and while abroad, with courageous optimism,\r\nbegan to instruct the Prince in the 'lawes of his country and the\r\nduties of a King of England.' Of Sir John's two celebrated treatises--De\r\nNatura Legis Naturæ, and De Laudibus Legum Angliæ--the latter and most\r\nfamous was specially compiled for the benefit of the Prince, and Sir\r\nEdward Coke has enthusiastically declared it 'worthy to be written in\r\nletters of gold for the weight and worthiness thereof.'\r\n\r\nA Fortescue of a later generation who 'took to the law,' eventually\r\nbecame Master of the Rolls. He was a great friend of the poet Pope, and\r\nfrom the gentle mockery in some of the long letters of the poet still in\r\nexistence, it would seem that Mr Fortescue had a proper share of\r\nprejudice in favour of his own county. In 1724 Pope writes: 'I am\r\ngrieved to tell you that there is one Devonshire man not honest; for my\r\nman Robert proves a vile fellow, and I have discarded him.' And in\r\nanother letter, nearly ten years later, in March, 1734-35: 'Twitnam is\r\nvery cold these easterly winds; but I presume they do not blow in the\r\nhappy regions of Devonshire.'\r\n\r\nSir John Fortescue, born in 1533, had the honour of being chosen\r\n'Preceptor to the Princess Elizabeth.' Later he was appointed Keeper of\r\nthe Great Wardrobe; whereupon it was remarked that Sir John Fortescue\r\nwas one whom the Queen trusted with the ornaments of her soul\r\nand body. 'Two men,' Queen Elizabeth would say, 'outdid her\r\nexpectations,--Fortescue for integrity, and Walsingham for subtlety and\r\nofficious services.'\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the eighteenth century a member of one of the\r\nbranches of Fortescues who settled in Ireland was created Lord Clermont.\r\nHe was very much liked by the Prince of Wales, and both Lord and Lady\r\nClermont were a great deal at Court. In Wraxall's 'Posthumous Memoirs'\r\nthere is an amusing account of an evening spent by Lady Clermont in\r\nlaunching into London society the Count Fersen who was noted for his\r\ndevotion to Marie Antoinette. Already 'Swedish Envoy at the Court of\r\nFrance,' he had arrived in England, 'bringing letters of introduction\r\nfrom the Duchesse de Polignac to many persons of distinction here, in\r\nparticular for Lady Clermont. Desirous to present him in the best\r\ncompany, soon after his arrival she conducted him in her own carriage to\r\nLady William Gordon's assembly in Piccadilly. She had scarcely entered\r\nthe room and made Count Fersen known to the principal individuals of\r\nboth sexes, when the Prince of Wales was announced. I shall recount the\r\nsequel in Lady Clermont's own words to me, only a short time subsequent\r\nto the fact. \"His Royal Highness took no notice of me on his first\r\narrival, but in a few minutes afterwards, coming up to me: 'Pray, Lady\r\nClermont,' said he, 'is that man whom I see here Count Fersen, the\r\nqueen's favourite?' 'The gentleman,' answered I, 'to whom your royal\r\nhighness alludes is Count Fersen; but so far from being a favourite of\r\nthe queen, he has not yet been presented at Court.' 'D----n!' exclaimed\r\nhe, 'you don't imagine I mean my mother?' 'Sir,' I replied, 'whenever\r\nyou are pleased to use the word \"queen\" without any addition, I shall\r\nalways understand it to mean my queen. If you speak of any other queen,\r\nI must entreat that you will be good enough to say the Queen of France,\r\nor of Spain.' The Prince made no reply; but after having walked once or\r\ntwice round Count Fersen, returning to me: 'He's certainly a very\r\nhandsome fellow,' observed he. 'Shall I have the honour, sir,' said I,\r\n'to present him to you?' He instantly turned on his heel, without giving\r\nme any answer; and I soon afterwards quitted Lady William Gordon's\r\nhouse, carrying Count Fersen with me. We drove to Mrs St John's, only a\r\nfew doors distant, who had likewise a large party on that evening. When\r\nI had introduced him to various persons there, I said to him, 'Count\r\nFersen, I am an old woman and infirm, who always go home to bed at\r\neleven. You will, I hope, amuse yourself. Goodnight.' Having thus done\r\nthe honours as well as I could to a stranger who had been so highly\r\nrecommended to me, I withdrew into the ante-chamber and sate down alone\r\nin a corner, waiting for my carriage.\r\n\r\n'\"While there the Prince came in, and I naturally expected, after his\r\nrecent behaviour, that he would rather avoid than accost me. On the\r\ncontrary, advancing up to me: 'What are you doing here, Lady Clermont?'\r\nasked he. 'I am waiting for my coach, sir,' said I, 'in order to go\r\nhome.' 'Then,' replied he, 'I will put you into it and give you my arm\r\ndown the stairs.' 'For heaven's sake, sir,' I exclaimed, 'don't attempt\r\nit! I am old, very lame, and my sight is imperfect; the consequence of\r\nyour offering me your arm will be that, in my anxiety not to detain your\r\nroyal highness, I shall hurry down and probably tumble from the top of\r\nthe staircase to the foot.' 'Very likely,' answered he, 'but if you\r\ntumble, I shall tumble with you. Be assured, however, that I will have\r\nthe pleasure of assisting you and placing you safely in your carriage.'\r\nI saw that he was determined to repair the rudeness with which he had\r\ntreated me at Lady William Gordon's, and therefore acquiesced. He\r\nremained with me till the coach was announced, conversed most agreeably\r\non various topics, and as he took care of me down the stairs, enjoined\r\nme at every step not to hurry myself. Nor did he quit me when seated in\r\nthe carriage, remaining uncovered on the steps of the house till it\r\ndrove off from the door.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nLundy, Lynmouth, and the Borders of Exmoor\r\n\r\n    'Ay, ay, the year's awaking,\r\n    The fire's among the ling,\r\n    The beechen hedge is breaking,\r\n    The curlew's on the wing:\r\n    Primroses are out, lad,\r\n    On the high banks of Lee,\r\n    And the sun stirs the trout, lad,\r\n    From Brendon to the sea.\r\n\r\n    'I know what's in your heart, lad,--\r\n    The mare he used to hunt,\r\n    And her blue market-cart, lad,\r\n    With posies tied in front--\r\n    We miss them from the moor road,\r\n    They're getting old to roam;\r\n    The road they're on's a sure road,\r\n    And nearer, lad, to home.'\r\n\r\n    H. NEWBOLT: _April on Waggon Hill_.\r\n\r\nThe charm of the coast-line of North Devon lies partly in its great\r\nirregularity. 'At one spot a headland, some five hundred feet high,\r\nrough with furze-clad projections at the top, and falling abruptly to a\r\nbay; then, perhaps, masses of a low, dark rock, girding a basin of turf,\r\nas at Watermouth; again, a recess and beach, with the mouth of a stream;\r\na headland next in order, and so the dark coast runs whimsically\r\neastward, passing from one shape to another like a Proteus, until it\r\nunites with the massive sea-front of Exmoor.' At the eastern ridge of\r\nthe county, the hill on which Oldbarrow Camp stands rises more than\r\neleven hundred feet straight out of the sea.\r\n\r\nIlfracombe's tiny bay is almost surrounded by rocks, but a pier was\r\nbuilt by one of the Bourchiers, Earls of Bath, and his successors--one\r\nSir Bourchier Wrey after another--have improved and enlarged it.\r\nWestcote speaks of it as 'a pretty harbour for ships of small burden,\r\nbut dangerous to come in in some winds, especially for strangers; for\r\nwhose better security they keep a continual pharos to direct their\r\ncourse.' The lighthouse now stands on the Lantern Rock, at the mouth of\r\nthe harbour, where once stood a little chapel dedicated to St Nicholas.\r\nThe dedication explains its position, for St Nicholas was a sea-saint,\r\nwhose protection used to be specially implored as a defence against\r\nshipwreck.\r\n\r\nNowadays Ilfracombe is of no consequence as a port, but six centuries\r\nago it must have been of some importance, for when Edward III was\r\nbesieging Paris it contributed six ships and eighty-two mariners to a\r\nfleet. Although the nucleus of the town is old, and indeed consisted\r\nonly of one 'scattering street,' its development is very modern, and has\r\nhappened since it became popular as a watering-place.\r\n\r\nThe architecture of the church is very varied. The tower is probably\r\nNorman, finished by Perpendicular battlements and pinnacles; it is built\r\nabove the centre of the north aisle, and projects into the church. There\r\nare also remains of Transitional work, and in the chancel is a Decorated\r\npiscina.\r\n\r\nLeading inland from Ilfracombe are 'lovely combes, with their green\r\ncopses, and ridges of rock, and golden furze, fruit-laden orchards, and\r\nslopes of emerald pasture, pitched as steep as house-roofs, where the\r\nred long-horns are feeding, with their tails a yard above their heads.'\r\nAbout twenty-two miles to the west, the sea-line is broken by an island,\r\nabout which there is an indefinable air of romance. Lundy is three and a\r\nhalf miles long, its greatest width is a few yards short of a mile, and\r\nit is surrounded by high and dangerous cliffs and rocks--too well known\r\neven in the present day by the ships wrecked on them. Perhaps those\r\noftenest heard of are the reefs of the Hen and Chickens, 'fringed with\r\ngreat insular rocks, bristling up amid the sea,' which dashes on them in\r\na never-ceasing cloud of foam on the north, and the fatal Shutter on the\r\nsouth-west. Lundy has been described as a 'lofty table-headed granite\r\nrock.... The cliffs and adjacent sea are alive with seabirds, every\r\nledge and jutting rock being alive with them, or they are whirling round\r\nin clouds, filling the air with their discordant screams.' Westcote\r\nremarked: 'In breeding time, in some places, you shall hardly know where\r\nto set your foot but on eggs,' and adds that it affords 'conies\r\nplentifully, doves, stares (which Alexander Nectan termeth Ganymede's\r\nbirds).' Mr Chanter translates 'Ganymede's birds to be gannets, as there\r\nwere very many of these birds there'; but an older commentator soars\r\nhigher, and thinks of eagles and ostriches!\r\n\r\nA description of Lundy as it was in the middle of the eighteenth century\r\nis dimly suggestive of Robinson Crusoe. 'Wild fowl were exceeding\r\nplenty, and a vast number of rabbits. The island was overgrown with\r\nferns and heath, which made it almost impossible to go to the extreme of\r\nthe island. Had it not been for the supply of rabbits and young\r\nsea-gulls our tables would have been but poorly furnished, rats being so\r\nplenty that they destroyed every night what was left of our repast by\r\nday. Lobsters were tolerably plenty, and some other fish we caught. The\r\ndeer and goats were very wild and difficult to get at. The path to the\r\nhouse was so narrow and steep that it was scarcely possible for a horse\r\nto ascend it. The inhabitants by the assistance of a rope climbed up a\r\nrock in which were steps cut to place their feet, to a cave or magazine\r\nwhere Mr Benson lodged his goods.' There have been considerable\r\ndifferences of opinion about the name, and Mr Baring-Gould believes:\r\n'Lundy takes its name from the puffins, in Scandinavian _Lund_, that at\r\nall times frequented it; but it had an earlier Celtic name, Caer Sidi,\r\nand is spoken of as a mysterious abode in the Welsh _Mabinogion_.'\r\n\r\nMany centuries later it seems to have had the power of inspiring\r\nfabulous tales, for Miss Celia Fiennes, who looked at it in her journey\r\nfrom Cornwall, makes a statement almost as wonderful as some of Sir John\r\nMandeville's tales of Barnacle Trees and other marvels. She says: 'I saw\r\nthe isle of Lundy, which formerly belonged to my Grandfather, William\r\nLord Viscount Say and Seale, which does abound with fish and rabbits and\r\nall sorts of ffowles, one bird y^t lives partly in the water and\r\npartly out and so may be called an amphibious creature; it's true that\r\none foot is like a turkey, the other a goose's foote; it lays its eggs\r\nin a place the sun shines on and sets it so exactly upright on the small\r\nend, and there it remaines till taken up, and all the art and skill of\r\npersons cannot set it up soe againe to abide.'\r\n\r\nLegends apart, Lundy has been the scene of many thrilling adventures,\r\nand has had an eventful history. The advantages of its position for\r\nwatching and falling upon richly laden merchant ships on their way to\r\nand from Bristol and other towns, and the great difficulties that met\r\nany enemy trying to land, resulted in the island being appropriated by\r\none band of pirates after another, of whom the De Moriscoes were the\r\nmost celebrated. Henry II, getting tired of their turbulence and\r\nlawlessness, granted the island to the Knights Templars, but it does not\r\nappear they were ever able to establish themselves there. In 1158 the\r\nraids of the Moriscoes became so intolerable that a special tax was\r\nimposed in Devon and Cornwall for the defence of their ports, and for\r\nfurnishing means for an attack on Lundy, but Sir William de Morisco\r\nseems to have triumphantly survived the storm. Later he was taken\r\nprisoner by the French in a sea-fight, but was eventually released.\r\n\r\nSir William, his son, was charged, upon the evidence of a semi-lunatic,\r\nwith conspiring to assassinate Henry III, and on the strength of it was\r\ncondemned to death--a sentence that, as he fled to Lundy, was not\r\ncarried out for four years, when he was taken by stratagem. Lundy was\r\nthen seized by the King, but forty years later the Moriscoes once more\r\ngained possession of it. Edward II granted the island to one of the\r\nDespencers, and in his own distress attempted to take refuge here:\r\n\r\n    'To Lundy, which in Sabrin's mouth doth stand,\r\n    Carried with hope (still hoping to find ease),\r\n    Imagining it were his native land,\r\n    England itself; Severn, the narrow sea;\r\n    With this conceit, poor soul! himself doth please.\r\n    And sith his rule is over-ruled by men,\r\n    On birds and beasts he'll king it once again.\r\n\r\n    ''Tis treble death a freezing death to feel;\r\n    For him on whom the sun hath ever shone,\r\n    Who hath been kneeled unto, can hardly kneel,\r\n    Nor hardly beg what once hath been his own.\r\n    A fearful thing to tumble from a throne!\r\n    Fain would he be king of a little isle;\r\n    All were his empire bounded in a mile.'\r\n\r\nBut the winds were against him, and he was driven on to the Welsh coast,\r\ninto the hands of his enemies.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Henry VIII, French pirates seized the island, and\r\nplundered and robbed at large, but they were accounted for by the valour\r\nof Clovelly fishermen, who made a determined attack, and killed or made\r\nprisoners of the whole band. In 1608 a commission was held to consider\r\nthe grievances of merchants who complained of piracy in the Bristol\r\nChannel; and in 1610 'another commission was issued to the Earl of\r\nNottingham to authorize the town of Barnstaple to send out ships for the\r\ncapture of pirates, and the deposition was taken of one William Young,\r\nwho had been made prisoner by Captain Salkeld, who entitled himself\r\n\"King of Lundy,\" and was a notorious pirate.' Two years later 'the _John\r\nof Braunton_ and the _Mayflower_ of Barnstaple caught as notorious\r\nRogues as any in England.' After another thirteen years: 'The Mayor of\r\nBristol reports to the Council that three Turkish pirate vessels had\r\nsurprised and taken the island of Lundy with the inhabitants, and had\r\nthreatened to burn Ilfracombe.' During an inquiry following this report,\r\nevidence was given that seems very curious when one considers the date,\r\nnearly halfway through the seventeenth century: 'From Nicholas Cullen,\r\n\"That the Turks had taken out of a church in Cornwall about sixty men,\r\nand carried them away prisoners.\"'\r\n\r\nFrench pirates made Lundy their headquarters three years later, and in\r\nJune, 1630, Captain Plumleigh reported that 'Egypt was never more\r\ninfested with caterpillars than the Channel with Biscayers. On the 23rd\r\ninstant there came out of St Sebastian twenty sail of sloops; some\r\nattempted to land on Lundy, but were repulsed by the inhabitants.'\r\n\r\nOne of the most conspicuous of all Lundy's owners was a certain Thomas\r\nBenson, merchant of Bideford, who, with great sang-froid and\r\nconsiderable humour, combined smuggling and piracy with being a member\r\nof Parliament. Unfortunately, his varied occupations after a while\r\nbrought him to grief. Amongst other charges, it was proved that he had\r\n'entered into a contract with the Government for the exportation of\r\nconvicts to Virginia and Maryland, and gave the usual bond to the\r\nsheriff for so doing. But instead of doing this he shipped them to\r\nLundy, where he employed them in building walls and other work in the\r\nisland. Every night they were locked up in the old keep of the\r\nMariscoes. He regarded himself as King of Lundy, and ruled with a high\r\nhand.' In answering this accusation he offered the ingenious excuse for\r\nhis breach of contract: 'That he considered Lundy to be quite as much\r\nout of the world as these colonies.'\r\n\r\nFrom Ilfracombe, towards Lynton, the road at first follows the edge of\r\nthe cliff, high above the sea. One tiny bay curves inland till the road\r\nseems almost to overhang the water, blue-green with undertones of grey,\r\nand the foam splashing on the broken rocks. All around is a sense of\r\nwide spaces and freshness. Headland beyond headland rises to the east,\r\nthe Little Hangman, Great Hangman, and Highveer Point, softened by a\r\ntransparent grey haze. A little to the right of them are the first\r\nridges of Exmoor, some long, some short, ending in full curves and\r\nslopes clearly outlined against the sides of their higher neighbours,\r\nand the highest against the sky. In the prettiest of hollows, Watermouth\r\nCastle looks down a slope of richest pasture to the sea sparkling below,\r\nand a great mass of rock shields it from storms blowing off the water.\r\nClouds of foliage soften the lines of the hill rising behind the Castle.\r\n\r\nA short distance inland is the village of Berrynarbour, chiefly to be\r\nremembered as the birthplace of John Jewel, Bishop of Salisbury, 'a\r\nperfect rich gem, and true jewel indeed,' over whose virtues Westcote\r\nfalls into panegyrics. 'If anywhere the observation of Chrysostom be\r\ntrue, that there lies a great hidden treasure in names, surely it may\r\nrightly be said to be here; grace in John and eminent perfection in\r\nJewel.'\r\n\r\nJohn Jewel was born in 1522, and when very young was sent to Oxford,\r\nwhere he showed a passion for learning, and before long became famous as\r\na lecturer and preacher. 'His behaviour was so virtuous that his\r\nheaviest adversary ... could not notwithstanding forbear to yield this\r\ntestimony to his commendation: \"I should love thee, Jewel, wert thou not\r\na Zuinglian. In thy faith thou art a heretic, but sure in thy life thou\r\nart an angel.\"'\r\n\r\nJewel's friendship with Peter Martyr, and other marks of his Protestant\r\nleanings, were the reason of his being expelled, in Queen Mary's days,\r\nfrom Corpus Christi College. But he had 'a little Zoar to fly\r\nunto'--Broadgates Hall, now Pembroke College.\r\n\r\nAs danger became more imminent, he escaped to Switzerland, and did not\r\ncome back to England until Elizabeth's reign had dawned. Fuller's brief\r\nsummary is that he 'wrote learnedly, preached painfully, lived piously,\r\ndied peaceably, Anno Domini 1572.' And his 'memory' (to return to\r\nWestcote) was 'a fragrant, sweet-smelling odour, blown abroad not only\r\nin that diocese, but generally through the whole kingdom.'\r\n\r\nOur author finishes his remarks on Berrynarbour by quoting an epitaph\r\nthen to be found in the church, a building which has a fine\r\nPerpendicular tower with battlement and pinnacles. The memorial was to\r\nNicholas Harper:\r\n\r\n    'Harper! the music of thy life,\r\n    So sweet, so free from jar or strife;\r\n    To crown thy skill hath rais'd thee higher,\r\n    And plac'd thee in the angels' choir:\r\n    And though that death hath thrown thee down,\r\n    In heaven thou hast thy harp and crown.'\r\n\r\nA short distance farther on, the road runs down into Combe Martin Bay,\r\nfollowing the little creek that narrows and narrows inland between high\r\nrock walls till two small houses seem almost to block it, and the road\r\ntwists round them and runs up the enclosed valley beyond. The village is\r\nan odd one, for it is over a mile long, but hardly any houses stand away\r\nfrom the main street, which is made up of cob-walled, thatched cottages,\r\nquite large shops, little slate-roofed houses, and villas in their own\r\ngarden, all jumbled together as if they had been thrown down\r\naccidentally. Masses of red valerian, and some of the graceful bright\r\nrose-bay willow-herb, give colour to the banks and overhang the walls.\r\n\r\nCombe Martin has the rare distinction amongst English parishes of owning\r\nmines with veins of silver as well as lead. Camden tells us that the\r\nsilver-mines 'were first discovered in Edward the First's days, when\r\nthree hundred and fifty men were brought from the Peak in Derbyshire, to\r\nwork here.' This statement Fuller amplifies by the note that 'It was\r\nforged for the Lady _Eleanor_ Dutchesse of _Barr_, daughter to the said\r\nKing, who married the year before.'\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Edward III the mines yielded the King 'great profits\r\ntowards carrying on the French war,' and Henry V 'made good use of\r\nthem,' but after that they were neglected for a long while. In Queen\r\nElizabeth's reign, Adrian Gilbert, Sir Humphrey's brother, began to work\r\nthem again, and Sir Beavis Bulmer followed with considerable success,\r\n'by whose mineral skill great quantity of silver was landed and\r\nrefined.'\r\n\r\nThe Queen presented the Earl of Bath with a rich and fair silver cup\r\nmade here, bearing this inscription:\r\n\r\n    'In Martin's-Comb long lay I hid,\r\n    Obscure, depress'd with grosser soil;\r\n    Debased much with mixed lead,\r\n    Till Bulmer came, whose skill and toil\r\n    Refined me so pure and clean\r\n    As richer nowhere else is seen.\r\n\r\n    'And adding yet a farther grace,\r\n    By fashion he did enable\r\n    Me worthy for to take a place\r\n    To serve at any prince's table.\r\n    Comb-Martin gave the ore alone,\r\n    Bulmer fining and fashion.'\r\n\r\nThe mines have been worked at intervals since, and as late as 1845 a\r\nsmelting-house was built in the valley.\r\n\r\nThe church is of rose-coloured stone, and has a high battlemented tower,\r\nin which are niches with figures in them. There is a good screen, with\r\npaintings of the Apostles on the panels. In the south aisle is a\r\nmonument to the wife of William Hancock, 'an effigy the size of life,\r\nexquisitely and elaborately sculptured in white marble. It bears the\r\ndate 1634. Dame Hancock is represented in the dress of that time,\r\ncovered with point lace and looped with knots of riband; she has a pearl\r\nnecklace round her throat and her hair in curls, and bears some\r\nresemblance to the portraits of Henrietta Maria, queen of Charles I.'\r\n\r\nFrom Combe Martin the road to Lynton turns inland and makes a deep curve\r\nto the south, and two or three miles from its most southerly point, and\r\nabout ten miles from Ilfracombe, is Arlington Court, the home of one of\r\nthe many branches of that great North Devon family, the Chichesters. The\r\nfirst of this name were settled at Chichester in Sussex, but by marriage\r\nwith the daughter and heiress of John de Raleigh, about the middle of\r\nthe fourteenth century, John Chichester came into the possession of\r\nseveral manors in North Devon. About a hundred and fifty years later,\r\nYoulston, with other manors, was granted to 'John Chichester and\r\nMargaret his wife and their heirs for ever, at the annual rent of a\r\nrose, at the feast of St John the Baptist.'\r\n\r\nSir John Chichester was among the most zealous Protestants in\r\nsuppressing the rising that broke out in the West in 1549. After the\r\ninsurrection was crushed, 'it was declared that the rebels used the\r\nchurch bells in every parish to excite the people. The bells were taken\r\ndown, and all the clappers were made a present to Sir John Chichester,\r\nas a reward for having assisted against the rebels. Strype says: \"No\r\nquestion he made good benefit thereof.\"'\r\n\r\nSir John had reason to be proud of his seven sons, for four 'were\r\nknights, one created a baron, and one a viscount.' Ireland was the\r\nspecial field of their triumphs, and it is a curious coincidence that\r\nfour hundred years before one of their ancestors, 'Master Robert de\r\nCicester, ... being a discreet person,' had been specially chosen to go\r\non the King's business to that country.\r\n\r\nPrince calls Sir Arthur Chichester, the second son, 'one of the chiefest\r\nornaments of our country.' He received his baptism of fire in France,\r\nunder the command of Henri IV, and 'for some notable exploit done by\r\nhim ... was by that puissant prince honoured with knighthood.' He fought\r\nin the Armada, and the next year sailed as one of Drake's captains, and\r\nthen became lieutenant-colonel of a regiment in the West Indies. Fuller\r\nspeaks of his career in Ireland in the sympathetic tone of his day\r\ntowards that unhappy country. 'By his valour he was effectually\r\nassistant, first to _plough_ and _break_ up that barbarous Nation by\r\nConquest, and then to _sow_ it with _seeds of civility_ when by King\r\n_James_ made Lord Deputy of _Ireland_.' The 'good laws and Provisions'\r\nmade by former Governors were 'like good lessons set for a Lute out of\r\ntune, useless untill the Instrument was fitted for them.' Sir Arthur\r\nestablished new and wider circuits for Justices of Assize, with the most\r\nexcellent results, for, 'like good Planets in their several spheres,\r\nthey carried the influence of Justice round about the Kingdom.' And, if\r\nFuller is right, although he governed with a very firm and sometimes\r\nheavy hand, he contrived to avoid the unpopularity which it would be\r\nimagined must have fallen to his share amongst an oppressed and\r\nrebellious people. Indeed, not only did the Irish under his authority\r\nseem, for a time, resigned to English rule, but they even showed a\r\npassing desire to imitate their fashions; for, 'in conformity to the\r\nEnglish Custome, many _Irish_ began to cut their _mantles_ into\r\n_cloaks_.'\r\n\r\nIn 1612 Sir Arthur was created Lord Chichester of Belfast, and, having\r\nresigned his office of Lord Deputy, was called back to it two years\r\nlater--the same year, his biographer observes, that the Irish harp took\r\nits place in the arms of England. His 'administration,' says Leland,\r\n'was active, vigilant, cautious, firm, and suited to a country scarcely\r\nemerging to civilization and order.'\r\n\r\nA rather florid 'Elegie on the Death of my Lord Chichester' reflects\r\ncontemporary opinion:\r\n\r\n    'From Chichester's discent he tooke his name.\r\n    And in exchange of it, return'd such fame\r\n    By his brave deeds, as to that race shall be\r\n    A radiant splendour for eternitie.\r\n    For fame shall write this Adage. Let it last\r\n    Like the sweete memorie of my Lord Belfast.'\r\n\r\nIn Swymbridge Church there is a monument of a youthful Chichester,\r\n'whose portrait is given, and whom the bird of Jove is represented as\r\ncarrying off to serve Ganymede in heaven. Turning back towards the\r\ncoast, the thought of Sir Robert Chichester, son of Lord Chichester's\r\neldest brother, is suggested. For tradition says that he is forced to\r\nhaunt the shore near Martinhoe, weaving traces out of sand (_the_\r\noccupation of aristocratic ghosts in North Devon!), and, having fixed\r\nthem to his carriage, he must drive up the face of the crag and through\r\na narrow cleft at the top, known as Sir Robert's Road. 'The natives\r\nbelieve that they hear his voice of rage as he labours at his nightly\r\ntask; and at other times they fancy that they see him scouring over\r\nChallacombe Downs, followed by a pack of hounds, whose fiery tails gleam\r\nin the gathering darkness.'\r\n\r\nThe descent into Parracombe is almost alarming, as the village is at the\r\nbottom of a valley with precipitous sides. Driving down-hill, the ground\r\nfalls away so sharply that just beyond the horses' heads one sees only\r\nspace. The old and interesting church of St Helen is Early English; it\r\nis now used only on rare occasions, and a new church has been built\r\nclose by. St Helen's keeps its old chancel screen, but it is in a\r\nmutilated condition, for the rood-beam was taken away to be cut up into\r\nbench-ends!\r\n\r\nOver all this valley hovers the charm of an overflowing abundance, which\r\nparticularly shows itself in the pleasant gardens of fruit and flowers,\r\nand the overgrown hedges with their rich decoration of berries, crimson\r\nleaves, and purple and golden flowers.\r\n\r\nDirectly north is the bit of coast that Kingsley so vividly described:\r\n'What a sea-wall they are, those Exmoor hills! Sheer upward from the sea\r\na thousand feet rise the mountains; and as we slide and stagger lazily\r\nalong before the dying breeze, through the deep water which never leaves\r\nthe cliff, the eye ranges, almost dizzy, up some five hundred feet of\r\nrock, dappled with every hue, from the intense dark of the tide-line;\r\nthrough the warm green and brown rock-shadows, out of which the\r\nhorizontal cracks of the strata loom black, and the breeding gulls show\r\nlike lingering snowflakes; up to the middle cliff, where delicate grey\r\nfades into pink, pink into red, red into glowing purple; up to where the\r\npurple is streaked with glossy ivy wreaths, and black-green yews; up to\r\nwhere all the choir of colours vanishes abruptly on the mid-hill, to\r\ngive place to one yellowish-grey sheet of upward down, sweeping aloft\r\nsmooth and unbroken, except by a lonely stone, or knot of clambering\r\nsheep, and stopped by one great rounded waving line, sharp-cut against\r\nthe brilliant blue. The sheep hang like white daisies upon the steep;\r\nand a solitary falcon rides, a speck in air, yet far below the crest of\r\nthat tall hill. Now he sinks to the cliff edge, and hangs quivering,\r\nsupported, like a kite, by the pressure of his breast and long curved\r\nwings, against the breeze.'\r\n\r\nAbout six miles west of Lynmouth is the lovely valley of Heddon's\r\nMouth--that is, 'the Giant's mouth; _Etin_, A.S., a giant.' It is a very\r\nnarrow green cleft, shut in by two precipitous cliffs rising eight\r\nhundred feet straight out of the sea. Heddon's Mouth Water hurries along\r\nthe glen, buries itself in a bank of shingle, and flows out again lower\r\ndown the beach. Huge rocks tumbled together make great barriers that\r\nblock each side of the cove. On the eastern side, close to the mouth of\r\nthe valley, part of the towering wall seems to have fallen away, showing\r\nbare rocks and soil of a warm light brown tempered by shades of pink.\r\nThe western side is very steep, but covered with short grass, sea-pinks\r\nand thyme, and crowned by a great mass of boulders. The face to the sea\r\nis slightly hollowed, suggesting that on this side also part of the\r\ncliff has fallen. East and west, one great headland after another is\r\nseen, misty but impressive, above a silvery grey sea. Inland the valley\r\nchanges suddenly from barren cliffs to a profusion of copses and\r\nthickets, and several beautiful deeply cleft combes, overbrimming with\r\nthick trees, open into the valley. Among the wayside bushes are the\r\npretty purple-crimson flower-heads and thick cool leaves of that not\r\nvery common wild-flower, livelong.\r\n\r\nA road passing through a wood and by a little rushing stream overhung by\r\nhazels, leads towards Lynton, and crosses the tiny railway, on whose\r\nbank masses of the slender stems of great moon-like evening primroses\r\nshine in the grey twilight with an almost weird effect.\r\n\r\nThe more interesting way to Lynton is along the coast-road, which is\r\nsoon reached from the valley. Beneath the road the cliffs fall\r\nprecipitously hundreds of feet to the sea, and a few little horned sheep\r\nand some white goats, scrambling on the face of them, seemed to have the\r\nsame hold as flies on a window-pane. Ravens are often seen even now\r\namongst these almost inaccessible rocks. The road runs through a\r\nfir-wood, and as it rises and falls one may catch delicious glimpses of\r\nthe sea through the ruddy stems and the great dark fans and tasselled\r\nends of the branches; and the scent of pine-needles and of the sea\r\nstirring amongst them makes the charm still greater. The road looks down\r\ninto Wooda Bay, which is also surrounded by woods, and passes to the\r\ntinier but very lovely Lee Bay. A little combe leads down to the shore,\r\nsheltered by leaves which, luminous from the sunshine above them, shade\r\nthe glen from the fierce rays, and it is filled with a subdued,\r\nmysterious light. Stem beyond stem is partly hidden by the fresh,\r\nvigorous green shoots springing round them, or hanging in garlands from\r\nbranch to branch, and suggests the wonderful fairyland that Richard\r\nDoyle saw, and enabled many people to see.\r\n\r\nA little stream, breaking into miniature waterfalls and reflecting the\r\nfoliage in its pools, finally disappears into the shingle, to emerge\r\nclose to the sea. A few yards away is a tiny dropping-well on the face\r\nof the cliff, almost hidden by a green veil of plants that grow at the\r\nfoot of the rocks or swing from the clefts.\r\n\r\nClose to the bay stands Lee Abbey, a comparatively modern house, on the\r\nsite of the old house of the De Wichehalses--a family who, considering\r\nthe not very remote date of their history, have been surrounded with a\r\nsurprising number of fables: Mr Blackmore contributed a share.\r\n\r\nThe Wichehalses had not a Dutch origin; the daughter of the house called\r\nJanifred never existed, and consequently the whole tragic tale of her\r\nlover's faithlessness and her sad fate is entirely imaginary. 'The\r\nWichehalses,' says Mr Chanter, who has studied their history with\r\nminute care, 'originally took their name from their dwelling-place, a\r\nhamlet called Wych, near Chudleigh. Nicholas, a younger son, but founder\r\nof the most eminent branch, settled in Barnstaple about 1530, and made a\r\nlarge fortune in the woollen trade, part of which he spent in buying\r\nproperty in North Devon--amongst others, the Manors of Lynton and\r\nCountisbury. Here his grandson Hugh Wichehalse removed in 1627, leaving\r\nBarnstaple with his wife and children for the double reason that\r\npolitical troubles were already brewing and rumours were afloat that the\r\nplague was drawing near.'\r\n\r\nHugh Wichehalse seems to have avoided all strife as far as possible, but\r\nhis son John threw himself vehemently on to the side of the Parliament,\r\nand became notorious for persecuting the Royalist clergy in the country\r\nround, whose lot in any case was a sorry one. John sold some of his\r\nestates and left a portion to his younger son, so that his eldest son\r\n(another John) and his wife, both of whom were extravagant, soon found\r\nthemselves in difficulties. John Wichehalse made himself justly\r\nunpopular by the part he played after Sedgemoor. A Major Wade, in the\r\nDuke of Monmouth's army, had escaped from the battle-field and, with two\r\nother men, was hidden by a farmer at Farley. A search was made for them,\r\nin which Wichehalse joined with one of his servants, whom he had armed.\r\nHis conduct was particularly odious, because Wade was a great friend of\r\nsome of his own relations, who had very generously, by gifts, loans, and\r\ngood counsel, repeatedly helped him out of his difficulties. In course\r\nof time they arrived at the right farm, and while they were coming in by\r\nthe front door, Wade and the others escaped by the back. Babb,\r\nWichehalse's servant, and another of the party saw the men running, and\r\nfired, and Wade was shot through the body, so that he was disabled and\r\ntaken prisoner. Wichehalse's servants also killed another of Monmouth's\r\nmen, and his body was impaled on a gate near Ley.\r\n\r\n'In the neighbourhood,' says Mr Chanter, 'the blame was put on his\r\nservant, John Babb, who was said to have incited his master to kill\r\nevery rebel they could find; and local tradition has it that the Babbs,\r\nwho had been the favourite retainers at Ley, never prospered after. When\r\ntheir master left Lynton they moved to West Leymouth, as the modern\r\nLynmouth was called then, and employed themselves in the herring-curing\r\nindustry, which the cottagers said failed because Babb was engaged in\r\nit; and years after his granddaughter, Ursula Babb, was pointed out as\r\nthe last of the race with the curse on it, and, as she was reported to\r\npossess the evil eye, became a great object of fear to all around.'\r\n\r\nJohn Wichehalse and his wife went to London, and wasted their goods\r\nuntil he died, when the mortgages were foreclosed, and no property in\r\nLynton was left to the family. The melancholy fate of their daughter\r\nMary may have suggested the more romantic story of Janifred. Mary\r\nWichehalse married, but later returned to Lynton, where, under the care\r\nof a faithful servant, she spent her time wandering over the cliffs\r\nlooking at the lost inheritance. Some say that she fell off the rocks,\r\nand others that she was washed away by the tide, but both accounts agree\r\nthat she was drowned.\r\n\r\nThe Valley of Rocks is wild, grand, and rather dreary, 'all crags and\r\npinnacles.' Southey was deeply impressed by it: 'Imagine a narrow vale\r\nbetween two ridges of hills somewhat steep; the southern hill turfed;\r\nthe vale, which runs from east to west, covered with huge stones and\r\nfragments of stone among the fern that fills it; the northern ridge\r\ncompletely bare, excoriated of all turf and all soil, the very bones and\r\nskeletons of the earth; rock reclining upon rock, stone piled upon\r\nstone, a huge terrific mass--a palace of the preAdamite kings, a city of\r\nthe Anakim, must have appeared so shapeless, and yet so like the ruins\r\nof what had been shaped after the waters of the flood had subsided. I\r\nascended with some toil the highest point; two large stones inclining on\r\neach other formed a rude portal on the summit. Here I sat down. A little\r\nlevel platform, about two yards long, lay before me, and then the eye\r\nimmediately fell upon the sea, far, very far below. I never felt the\r\nsublimity of solitude before.' Names have been given to the great\r\nrock-masses. The Castle Rock looks far over the sea, the Devil's\r\nCheesewring is on the inner side of the valley, and there are many\r\nothers. A narrow path cut in the deep descent of the cliffs leads from\r\nthe valley, 'where screes and boulders, red and grey and orange, covered\r\nfor the most part with lichen or tendrils of ground-ivy, lend splashes\r\nof vivid colouring to the hill-side;' and about a mile farther on is\r\nLynton.\r\n\r\nPerched on the cliffs nine hundred feet immediately above Lynmouth,\r\nLynton looks down to the inlet, into which two ravines open from the\r\nsouth. Down these ravines rush the East and West Lyns, hidden among the\r\nwoods; and the two streams join just before they reach the sea-shore.\r\nCountisbury Foreland stands high to the east of the harbour and\r\nstretches far out into the sea, and between the foreland and the\r\nmainland is another long, steep, winding cleft.\r\n\r\nI once saw the bay in an exquisite light very early in the morning.\r\nEarth and sky and sea were all veiled in the softest grey, and in the\r\nsky was one little flush of pale rose pink. But for a sea-gull crying\r\nunder the cliff, the stillness was absolute.\r\n\r\nLynmouth consists of a tiny quay, a little group of houses, and the\r\nravines beyond. It is impossible to imagine any place where buildings\r\nand tourists could more exasperate a true lover of earlier days. Still,\r\nthey cannot have more than a superficial effect--except at the meeting\r\nof the streams, which is quite spoilt by the houses on either side.\r\n\r\nThe music of the Lyns has been noticed by many comers, and about sixty\r\nyears ago the Rev. H. Havergal, whilst staying here and listening to the\r\ncontinuous tone of the Lyn at low-water, composed this chant:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSIC OF THE LYNS.]\r\n\r\nAs a place for visitors to admire, Lynton was discovered in the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century. The French Revolution and\r\nNapoleonic wars obliged those who were in the habit of going abroad for\r\nchange and amusement to look for it in comparatively unknown parts at\r\nhome. In 1807 the first hotel--not counting a small and inconvenient\r\nvillage hostelry--was opened; and even at this date there were no\r\nwheeled vehicles in either village, ponies and donkeys carrying\r\neverything. Until this time Lynton and Lynmouth had been the quietest of\r\nlittle fishing-villages, without even the doings of a resident squire or\r\nrector to furnish a subject for a little gossip.\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical history of the little neighbouring parish of\r\nCountisbury is very much mixed up with that of Lynton. Mr Chanter prints\r\nsome of the Countisbury churchwardens' accounts, which, as he observes,\r\nare chiefly remarkable for the prominent part that beer played in every\r\nevent, from killing a fox to the visitation of 'ye Dean Ruler.'\r\n\r\n                                                          s. d.\r\n'Pd when one fox was killed for beer                      2  0\r\n Pd more for beare when one fox was killed                2  6\r\n Pd for bear when two foxes were killed                   7  6\r\n Pd for ale for the fox hunters                           2  0'\r\n\r\nOther entries are for killing 'wild cats, greys [badgers], and hedge\r\nhogs ... salaries of dog-whipper ... fox-hunter, etc., and repairs to\r\nthe base viol.'\r\n\r\nLynmouth and Lyn were noted for the fishery, and especially for their\r\nherrings and oysters. The fishery was developed in quite early days by\r\nthe abbots of Ford Abbey, who claimed the whole coast-line of Lynton and\r\nof Countisbury. Cellars and curing-houses, called 'red-herring houses,'\r\nwere built close to the beach, and were apt to be swept away by any\r\nviolent storm, for the little harbour has a double reason for dreading\r\nbad weather--not only do the breakers surge over their usual limits and\r\nwash away or damage all that is in their way, but at the same time the\r\nstreams come down a roaring, foaming torrent, which rolls along great\r\nboulders and hurls itself against all obstacles. In 1607 a whole row of\r\nred-herring houses was swept away, and since that date the records of\r\ndisputes as to repairs to the harbour and petitions from the fishermen\r\ntell how greatly they have suffered from this cause. The fishing has\r\ndwindled until it is now a very trifling matter indeed.\r\n\r\nThe small parish of Countisbury is high on the cliffs, on the eastern\r\nside of the river, and the road to it from Lynmouth rises at once to a\r\nheight of eleven hundred feet. A little Perpendicular church with an\r\nembattled tower crowned by pinnacles stands at the mercy of every wind\r\nthat blows.\r\n\r\nFarther to the east, and almost on the boundary-line of Somerset, is\r\nOldbarrow Camp, which differing archæologists have claimed to be\r\nBritish, Roman, and Danish. From this hill the fall to the sea is\r\nprecipitous, and the descent into Somerset is almost as steep; inland,\r\nthe ground also sinks away, leaving a magnificent view and a grand sense\r\nof space. Even when the light is fading there is a great charm, for\r\nlooking down into the hollow, one sees a faint blue tinge lying like\r\nbloom upon the misty twilight that nils the valley--a sharp contrast to\r\nthe clear darkness of the evening sky. Countisbury Camp is not far from\r\nOldbarrow, and in Lynton there are two more ancient 'castles,' each\r\nconsisting of a single fosse and rampart, and other monuments. Several\r\nstone circles, 'over forty feet in diameter,' have been wickedly removed\r\nfrom the Valley of Rocks 'for the purpose of selling them as\r\ngate-posts!...' Spindle-wheels, or pixie grinding-stones, as the natives\r\ncall them, have been found in the neighbourhood, as well as arrow-heads\r\nand 'a skinning knife with a ground edge of black flint.'\r\n\r\nThe winding valley of the West Lyn is very beautiful, but not so wild as\r\nthat of the East Lyn; it lies deep down beneath fir-woods, whose serried\r\nspires mount higher and higher on the steep hill-side. A little way from\r\nLynton, along this lovely road, is Barbrook Mill, and close by a cottage\r\ncovered with purple clematis, among trees loaded with rosy apples.\r\n\r\nFollowing up the East Lyn from Lynton, the fitness of Dean Alford's\r\nwords is realized:\r\n\r\n\r\nLYN-CLEAVE.\r\n\r\n    This onward deepening gloom; this hanging path\r\n      Over the Lyn that soundeth mightily,\r\n    Foaming and tumbling on, as if in wrath\r\n      That might should bar its passage to the sea;\r\n    These sundered walls of rock, tier upon tier,\r\n      Built darkly up into the very sky,\r\n    Hung with thick wood, the native haunt of deer\r\n      And sheep that browse the dizzy slopes on high.\r\n\r\nThese 'walls of rock' are now and again cleft by the narrow openings of\r\nsteep and wild ravines. It is intensely solitary; there is scarcely any\r\nsound or movement, but perhaps a buzzard high in the air may hang over\r\nthe valley for a few moments. About two miles from the harbour is\r\nWatersmeet, where the Farley Water rushes into the Lyn. When the leaves\r\nare on the trees the stream can hardly be seen from the road, for it\r\nlies below a high, steep bank. By the water's edge in the shaded light\r\nthere is a suggestion of mystery, and the bed of the stream is so shut\r\nin that but for the stirring of the leaves, the shifting gleams of\r\nsunlight in the waters, and the freshness of the air, one could almost\r\nimagine oneself underground. The glossy leaves of festoons of ivy and\r\nwild-flowers cover the red rocks. The Farley Water falls over a\r\nsuccession of little waterfalls, swirling and foaming in the pools\r\nbetween, and then slips over little rocky ridges and slopes covered with\r\nduck-weed so wide that the 'stream covers it like no more than a thin\r\nfilm of glancing emerald.' Below, the valley opens enough to allow space\r\nfor a tiny lawn, overhung with oak-trees; and here it is joined by the\r\nLyn, which has raced along the farther side of a steep tongue of land.\r\n\r\nThe road passes a fir-wood, bright with golden-rod and ragwort and soft\r\nblue scabious, and by-and-by turns eastward, and reaches the scattered\r\nvillage of Brendon. Brendon 'church-town' is made up of church, school,\r\nparsonage, and a few farms, and can scarcely be called a village. The\r\nchurch stands high on the hill above the river; it is very small, and\r\nhas been rebuilt comparatively lately; its dedication is the most\r\ninteresting thing about it. All who ever rejoiced in 'The Water Babies'\r\nshould remember this Irish saint. 'Did you never hear of the blessed St\r\nBrandan, how he preached to the wild Irish, on the wild, wild Kerry\r\ncoast; he, and five other hermits, till they were weary and longed to\r\nrest?... So St Brandan went out to the point of Old Dunmore, and looked\r\nover the tide-way roaring round the Blasquets, at the end of all the\r\nworld, and away into the ocean, and sighed, \"Ah that I had wings as a\r\ndove!\" And far away, before the setting sun, he saw a blue fairy sea,\r\nand golden fairy islands, and he said, \"Those are the islands of the\r\nblest!\" Then he and his friends got into a hooker and sailed away and\r\naway to the westward, and were never heard of more.'\r\n\r\nA little higher up the little river (here known as Brendon Water) is a\r\nvery old bridge, now unused, and a wide modern bridge, which crosses the\r\ntwo branches of the divided stream just below a little green island.\r\nBushes crowd and overlap each other on the banks, and it is very likely\r\na grey water-wagtail will dart from among the leaves and flit jauntily\r\nupstream.\r\n\r\nThe road all this way follows the water--for some distance the boundary\r\nbetween the counties--and here it is sunk between the barriers of the\r\nCounty Wall separating Devonshire and Somersetshire. A great bare cliff,\r\ncovered only with short grass, and scanty tufts of heather and furze\r\ngrowing thinly upon it, towers above the road; the other side of the\r\nvalley is lower, gentler, and wooded. Malmsmead Bridge crosses over the\r\nBadgeworthy Water, as the stream--which seems to change its name nearly\r\nevery half-mile in the most perplexing manner--is here called, a little\r\nhigher than the point at which it is joined by its tributary, Oare\r\nWater. Above the bridge the road becomes a rough track that leads up\r\ninto the very wild and beautiful valley of Badgeworthy Water, well known\r\nby name to all lovers of 'Lorna Doone.' Some of the natives are apt to\r\nmislead strangers by wrongly calling this glen the Doone Valley. Further\r\nupstream the valley becomes narrower, and the sides steeper, winding in\r\nlong beautiful curves. The shallow stream is brown, but very bright and\r\nclear and pebbled; boggy patches lie here and there by the side, and in\r\none patch the sweet-ferns grow so large and thick that their\r\ncharacteristic 'sharp sweet' scent is strong enough to betray them\r\nbefore one catches sight of the finely-cut fronds. On the east side of\r\nBadgeworthy Water is Deer Park, where many deer lie and the fir-woods\r\ncome down to the water's edge. On the opposite side is Badgeworthy Wood,\r\nchiefly of oaks, most of which are not very large, but many of them are\r\ngnarled. The number of oak-apples that I have seen in this wood was\r\namazing; on one tree they seemed like cherries on a cherry-tree. Nearly\r\nall were scarlet, and they glowed in the sunshine.\r\n\r\n'Lorna Doone' has brought so many visitors to the scene that it is no\r\nnews to say that the account of the water-slide is fictitious. This word\r\nis deliberately chosen instead of 'exaggerated,' which is often applied\r\nto Mr Blackmore's picture of the fall; for he was not describing\r\nscenery--he was setting a scene in his novel, and there was no reason\r\nwhy he should be bound to inches, or even feet! And this argument\r\napplies to what he has said of the Doone Valley. At the same time, in\r\nhis 'Exploration of Exmoor,' Mr Page observes that a true description of\r\nthe valley of Badgeworthy Water would very nearly represent Mr\r\nBlackmore's Glen Doone; and it still seems absolutely apart from the\r\nordinary race and fret of life.\r\n\r\nTwo long, smooth slopes of rock one below another form the chief part of\r\nthe water-slide, and the thin stream slipping over them makes one wish\r\nto see how the fall would look when the water comes down, a roaring\r\ntorrent, swollen by heavy rains and melting snow. On one side of the\r\nwater-slide the ground rises very sharply, but up the other side a tiny\r\npath twists through the wood, and opens quite suddenly on a very still\r\nvalley with steep sides and a broad, open space between. A mountain-ash\r\nbearing vividly scarlet bunches of berries hangs over the stream close\r\nto the opening; but beyond, only a few stunted thorns grow sparsely\r\namongst an abundance of heather, furze, bracken, and whortleberries.\r\nLorna's bower seems to have been seen to some extent through the\r\nauthor's imagination. In a shallow combe at a little distance are the\r\nruins of what appear to have been the walls of enclosures, but they are\r\nvery indefinite. These are all that remain of the Doones' houses, but\r\nrecent research denies that the Doones ever existed!\r\n\r\nFrom the top of the hill above the water-slide there is a very beautiful\r\nview of the winding glens opening out of each other, and at this point\r\none is able to follow their curves for a long way before the hills shut\r\nthem out of sight. With the sun shining through the haziest clouds, and\r\nthe radiant glow of a diffused light calling out delicate tints on the\r\ndistant slopes, the whole scene seems most fitly described by the old\r\nwords of praise, 'a fair country.'\r\n\r\nRetracing the path to Malmsmead, one is irresistibly tempted to go a few\r\nsteps into Somerset to look at the tiny church of Oare, where, Mr\r\nBlackmore says, Lorna Doone and Jan Ridd were married. The church is\r\nvery narrow, and it stands among trees on the slope above the stream. On\r\nthe south side of the nave, close to where the old east wall stood (the\r\nchancel is new), is an early piscina of a curious shape; it is supported\r\nby a large carved human head, with a hand to each cheek, and there is a\r\nthick, solid cap on the top.\r\n\r\nChallacombe is a small village on the western border of Exmoor, seven or\r\neight miles south of Lynton, and the church looks far over the moors.\r\nWestcote derives the name from 'Choldicombe, or rather Coldecombe, from\r\nits cold situation, next neighbour to Exmoor;' and he speaks of 'divers\r\nhillocks of earth and stones ... termed burrows and distinguished by\r\nsundry names,' in the parish, and hints at their uncanny nature by\r\ntelling how 'fiery dragons have been seen flying and lighting on them.'\r\nSuch tales he dismisses scornfully, but he tells of 'a strange accident'\r\nthat happened 'within these seven years, verified by oath of the party,\r\nwho otherwise might have had credit for his honesty.' A labouring man,\r\nhaving saved enough money to buy a few acres of waste land, began to\r\nbuild himself a house on it, and from a burrow near by he fetched stones\r\nand earth. He had cut deep into the hillock, when 'he found therein a\r\nlittle place, as it had been a large oven, fairly, strongly, and closely\r\nwalled up; which comforted him much, hoping that some great good would\r\nbefall him, and that there might be some treasure there hidden to\r\nmaintain him more liberally and with less labour in his old years:\r\nwherewith encouraged he plies his work earnestly until he had broken a\r\nhole through this wall, in the cavity whereof he espied an earthen pot,\r\nwhich caused him to multiply his strokes until he might make the orifice\r\nthereof large enough to take out the pot, which his earnest desire made\r\nnot long a-doing; but as he thrust in his arm and fastened his hand\r\nthereon he suddenly heard, or seemed to hear, the noise of the trampling\r\nor treading of horses coming, as he thought, towards him, which caused\r\nhim to forbear and arise from the place, fearing the comers would take\r\nhis purchase from him (for he assured himself it was treasure); but\r\nlooking about every way to see what company this was, he saw neither\r\nhorse nor man in view. To the pot again he goes, and had the like\r\nsuccess a second time; and yet, looking all about, could ken nothing. At\r\nthe third time he brings it away, and therein only a few ashes and\r\nbones, as if they had been of children, or the like. But the man,\r\nwhether by the fear, which yet he denied, or other cause, which I cannot\r\ncomprehend, in very short time after lost senses both of sight and\r\nhearing, and in less than three months consuming died.'\r\n\r\nThis tale is followed by another, of a 'mystical sciencer,' and Westcote\r\nfinishes with the comment that the stories are 'not unfit tales for\r\nwinter nights when you roast crabs by the fire, whereof this parish\r\nyields none, the climate is too cold, only the fine dainty fruits of\r\nwortles and blackberries.'\r\n\r\nA little to the north of Challacombe is the great hill of Chapman\r\nBurrows, where stands a 'tall, lean slab of slate, the Longstone.' It is\r\nnine feet high, and in the broadest part about two feet eight inches\r\nwide. The history of the Longstone is unknown, but the suggestion has\r\nbeen made that it may be an ancient relic, a menhir, and this view is\r\nsupported by the fact that about a dozen large tumuli lie on the slopes\r\naround. One of these is between ten and twelve feet high and three\r\nhundred feet round at the base. Burrows are found all over Exmoor. 'The\r\neye of reflection sees stand uninterrupted a number of simple sepulchres\r\nof departed souls.... A morsel of earth now damps in silence the éclat\r\nof noisy warriors, and the green turf serves as a sufficient shroud for\r\nkings.'\r\n\r\nBy far the greatest part of Exmoor lies in Somerset, so that here one\r\nmust not wander far amongst great round hills, wide distances, and deep\r\ncombes. One has heard of strangers who have been disappointed by the\r\nfirst sight of Exmoor, for its heights are not very evident. There are\r\nno peaks, no sharply-cut isolated hills, nor any with a very striking\r\noutline, except Dunkery; but the whole moor is a tableland, across which\r\nthe coach road runs at a level from twelve hundred to fourteen hundred\r\nfeet above the sea: 'A bare rolling waste of moorland stretching away\r\ninto the eastern distance, like the ocean \"heaving in long swells,\"' and\r\nlarge spaces of bracken, of bogs fringed with cotton-grass and rough\r\ngrass and whortleberries, among which rise little glittering streams\r\nthat splash their way down into the valleys beneath.\r\n\r\nThe sides of the glens leading from the borders of the moor are crowded\r\nwith endless masses of mountain-ashes, and whether the leaves make a\r\nbackground to the flat creamy clusters of sweet, heavily scented flowers\r\nor to great bunches of scarlet fruit, the long ranks give a very rich\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nMr R. J. King has observed that Exmoor, 'still lonely and uncultivated,'\r\nwas probably at one time during the English conquests a boundary or\r\n'mark,' 'always regarded as sacred and placed under the protection of\r\nsome deity or hero.' Amongst some very interesting remarks, he says that\r\nthe intermingling in Devonshire of the Celtic and Teutonic races 'may be\r\ntraced in folk-lore, not less distinctly than in dialect or in\r\nfeatures.... Sigmund the Waelsing, who among our English ancestors\r\nrepresented Sigfried, the great hero of the Niebelungen-lied, has\r\napparently left his name to the deep pool of Simonsbath ... again, side\r\nby side with traditions of King Arthur, to the parish of Simonsward in\r\nCornwall.'\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to imagine any moorlands destitute of superstition, and\r\nplenty linger on Exmoor. Mr Page (writing in 1890) gave some instances\r\nthat have occurred comparatively lately. He speaks of 'overlooking' and\r\nof witchcraft, and says that 'not many years since the villagers of\r\nWithycombe, by no means an Ultima Thule among hamlets, firmly believed\r\nthat certain ancient dames had the power of turning themselves into\r\nwhite rabbits.'\r\n\r\n'An astonishing instance of belief in witchcraft' within his own\r\nexperience was one where an old woman--'as harmless a creature as can be\r\nfound in the country'--was believed by her neighbours to have not only\r\nthe evil eye, but also 'the power of turning herself into a black dog,\r\nin which form she was met a short time since, during the twilight hour,\r\nin a neighbouring lane. For these all-sufficient reasons the poor old\r\nsoul was, for a while, unable to obtain the services of a nurse during\r\nan illness from which she is only now recovering.'\r\n\r\nAnother story shows the remarkable powers of a wise woman. Mr Page\r\nexplains that he cannot give the real name of the couple, but calls them\r\nGiles. Giles deserted his wife. 'For a while Mrs Giles bore his absence\r\nwith a fortitude born, perhaps, of no very great love for her partner.\r\nThen she suddenly took it into her head to have him home. She did not\r\ntelegraph, she did not even write; but one day the errant husband was\r\nseen by the astonished villagers hurrying towards his deserted home.\r\n_And his footsteps were marked with blood!_ The witch-wife had compelled\r\nhis return in such haste that not only the soles of his boots, but those\r\nof his _feet_, were worn out.'\r\n\r\nMr Page mentions that 'the old mediæval custom of touching a corpse\r\nstill prevails. At an inquest lately held at or near South Molton, each\r\nof the coroner's jury, as he filed past the body, laid his fingers on\r\nthe forehead. This act, it was believed, would free him from dreams of\r\nthe deceased.\r\n\r\nOmens and portents such as mysterious knockings, a particular sound of\r\nchurch-bells, or a bird flying into a room, are very grave warnings, and\r\na story of this character comes from near Taunton. 'A farmer riding home\r\nfrom Taunton Market noticed a white rook among the sable flock settling\r\nover a field. When he reached home there were symptoms of uneasiness\r\namong his cattle, and that night the dogs barked so vociferously that\r\nhe had to get up and quiet them. In the morning he was dead.'\r\n\r\nWriting of other traditions, 'one of the most beautiful of Easter\r\ncustoms still survives. Young men have not yet ceased on the\r\nResurrection morning to climb the nearest hill-top to see the sun flash\r\nover the dark ridge of Quantock, or the more distant line of Mendip.' To\r\nsee the newly-arisen sun on Easter morning was an augury of good luck.\r\n'Early in the century Dunkery, probably because it is the highest land\r\nin Somerset, was favoured above all surrounding hills, and its sides,'\r\nsays Miss King, 'were covered with young men, who seemed to come from\r\nevery quarter of the compass, and to be pressing up towards the Beacon.'\r\n\r\nExmoor stag-hunting is far-famed, for it is the only corner of England\r\nwhere wild red deer are still to be found. The fashion of coming here to\r\nhunt from a distant part of the country is comparatively modern, but\r\nHugh Pollard, Ranger of the Forest, kept a pack of stag-hounds at\r\nSimonsbath more than three hundred years ago, and the Rangers who\r\nsucceeded him continued to keep the hounds.\r\n\r\nEven before the Conquest, the moor had been a royal hunting-ground.\r\nDeeds show that in the reign of Edward the Confessor there were at least\r\nthree Royal Foresters; and William I, says Mr Rawle, 'probably reserved\r\nto himself the forest rights, for the Conqueror, according to the Saxon\r\nChronicle, \"loved the tall deer as though he had been their father,\" and\r\nwould scarcely be likely to forgo any privileges concerning the vert and\r\nvenison.' Various tenures show that later Kings kept Exmoor as a\r\npreserve. Walter Aungevin held land in Auri and Hole (near South Molton)\r\nunder Edward III, 'by sergeantry that whensoever our lord the King\r\nshould hunt in the forest of Exmoor, he should find for him two barbed\r\narrows.' And Morinus de la Barr, farther to the west, near Braunton,\r\nheld his land on the same tenure with the addition of finding 'one\r\nsalmon.'\r\n\r\nNearly thirty years later in the same reign, a very curious tenure is\r\nregistered. 'Walter Barun held certain lands and tenements in the town\r\nof Holicote, of the King in capite, by the service of hanging upon a\r\ncertain forked piece of wood the red deer that die of the murrain in the\r\nKing's forest of Exmoor; and also of lodging and entertaining the poor\r\nstrangers, weakened by infirmities, that came to him, at his own proper\r\ncosts, for the souls of the ancestors of our Lord King Edward.'\r\n\r\nThe Forest of Exmoor was part of the jointure of several Queens of\r\nEngland. Henry VIII settled it on Catherine of Aragon, and it was\r\nafterwards held by Jane Seymour. James I gave it to his Queen, but\r\nCharles I had other views, and announced his intention of drawing 'the\r\nunnecessary Forests and Waste Lands' [Dartmoor and Exmoor] 'to\r\nimprovement.' Needless to say, the scheme died in its early stages, and\r\nwhen Charles II came to the throne, he granted a lease of the forest to\r\nthe Marquis of Ormonde.\r\n\r\nBesides the wild-deer on Exmoor, there are, as everyone knows, creatures\r\nalmost as wild--herds of Exmoor ponies. Very few now are pure 'Exmoors,'\r\nexcept those belonging to Sir Thomas Acland. Among these ponies the true\r\nbreed has been carefully preserved, and there has been no crossing. It\r\nseems a little odd to think of Exmoor ponies being mentioned in\r\nDomesday, but Mr Chanter quotes an entry referring to the stock in the\r\nparishes of Lynton and Countisbury, '72 brood mares, probably the Exmoor\r\nponies running half wild on the moor; in Brendon, 104 wild mares (_equas\r\nindomitas_) are mentioned.'\r\n\r\n'The average height is 12-1/2 hands, and bays and buffy bays with mealy\r\nnoses prevail; in fact, are in the majority of three to one.' The older\r\nponies live out all the year round, but stacks of hay and straw are\r\nbuilt by the herdsmen against the time when the snow lies deep. 'Still,\r\nlike honest, hard-working labourers, the ponies never assemble at the\r\nwicket till they have exhausted every means of self-support by\r\nscratching with their fore-feet in the snow for the remnants of the\r\nsummer tufts, and drag wearily behind them an ever-lengthening chain of\r\nsnowballs.'\r\n\r\nThe moor makes an excellent sheep-walk, but attempts to cultivate it\r\nhave not prospered. As far as agriculturists are concerned, 'Exmoor is\r\nbest left alone--the \"peat and heather in hill and dale.\"'\r\n\r\nThere is an old ballad called 'The Farmer's Son of Devonshire,' in which\r\nthe views of one character, 'Brother Jack,' show a distinct resemblance\r\nto those of the great John Fry in 'Lorna Doone.' Here are a few verses.\r\nThe sub-title is a long one, beginning: 'Being the Valiant Coronel's\r\nReturn from Flanders.' To the tune of 'Mary, live long.'\r\n\r\n    'WILL. Well met, Brother Jack, I've been in Flanders\r\n    With valiant Commanders, and am return'd back to England again;\r\n    Where a while I shall stay, and shall then march away;\r\n            I'm an Officer now.\r\n    Go with me, dear Brother, go with me, dear Brother,\r\n            And lay by the Plow.\r\n    I tell thee, old boy, the son of a farmer,\r\n    In glittering armour, may kill and destroy\r\n            A many proud French;\r\n    As a Squire or Knight, having courage to fight,\r\n            Then valiantly go,\r\n    In arms like a Soldier, in arms like a Soldier,\r\n            To face the proud foe.\r\n\r\n    'JACK. But, dear Brother Will, you are a vine yellow,\r\n    And talk mighty mellow, but what if they kill\r\n            Thy poor brother Jack\r\n    By the pounce of a gun? If they shou'd I'm undone.\r\n    You know that I never, you know that I never,\r\n            Had courage to fight.\r\n\r\n    [WILL replies at some length.]\r\n\r\n    'JACK. The enemies' men with horror will fill me,\r\n    Perhaps they may kill me, and where am I then?\r\n            This runs in my mind;\r\n    Should I chance to be lame, will the trophies of _Fame_\r\n            Keep me from sad groans?\r\n    A fig for that honour, a fig for that honour,\r\n            Which brings broken bones.\r\n\r\n    'Such honour I scorn, I'd rather be mowing,\r\n    Nay, plowing or sowing, or threshing of corn,\r\n            At home in a barn;\r\n    Then to leave Joan my wife, and to loose my sweet life,\r\n            In peace let me dwell;\r\n    I am not for fighting, I am not for fighting,\r\n            So, Brother, Farewell.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nCastles and Country-Houses\r\n\r\n    'As Marly's bright green leaves give place\r\n    To tints of rich and mellowed glow;\r\n    As close the shortening autumn days,\r\n    Whilst summer lingers, loth to go;\r\n    Quick rises each familiar scene,\r\n    And fancy homewards turns her gaze;\r\n    Such are the hues in Oakford seem,\r\n    And such a light o'er Iddesleigh plays--\r\n    Methinks the oaks of dear old Pynes\r\n    With richer brown delight the eye;\r\n    Nor would I take these reddening vines\r\n    For our wild cherry's crimson dye.'\r\n\r\n    EARL OF IDDESLEIGH.\r\n\r\nPowderham Castle is a fine building in a lovely setting. On the east the\r\npark leads down towards the marshy edge of the broad rippling estuary,\r\non either side there spread trees and bracken, with the deer feeding\r\namong them, and hills sloping gradually upwards make a very pretty\r\nbackground.\r\n\r\nThe Castle is difficult to describe, for one century after another has\r\nadded a wing or pulled down a corner, and the result is an irregular\r\nbuilding of very varying architecture. Even the exact colour is not easy\r\nto tell, but different shades of grey prevail. The north tower, the\r\nearliest part, is built of small and uneven stones. There is a tradition\r\nthat Powderham was begun by William of Eu soon after the Conquest, and\r\nanother story is that it existed before that date, and was built by a\r\nSaxon to prevent the Danes sailing up the river to Exeter; but the\r\noldest portion now standing is probably due to Sir Philip Courtenay, who\r\nwas born about A.D. 1337.\r\n\r\nThe Castle was strongly fortified, and in the Civil War withstood an\r\nattack planned by General Fairfax himself. The General, says Sprigg,\r\nordered 'a design in hand against Pouldrum-house, by water and land,\r\nwhich, being on Friday, December 12, was immediately put in\r\nexecution.... The design against Pouldrum-house was this, and thus\r\ncarried: Lord's Day, December 14, nine of the clock at night, Captain\r\nDeane (the comptroller of the ordnance) was commanded over Ex with 200\r\nfoot and dragoons, to possess Pouldrum-castle, but the enemy had some\r\nfew hours before got 150 into it, unto those that were there before,\r\nwhich our men not discovering before they had landed, would not return\r\nwithout attempting something. The church at Pouldrum being not far\r\ndistant from the castle, they resolved to possess and make the best of\r\nit, and accordingly did so, and the next morning they got provisions\r\nfrom Nutwell-house unto them into the church, and began to fortify the\r\nsame. The enemy at Excester, much startled hereat, fearing the castle\r\nwould be lost, as well as the river blocked up by the fortifying of this\r\nchurch, sent therefore, on Monday, the 15th, a party of 500 foot, who\r\njoining with 200 from the castle assaulted our men about seven at night,\r\nthrew in many hand granadoes amongst them, and so continued storming\r\ntill ten, but were beaten off with much loss, leaving their dead on the\r\nplace, and carrying with them many wounded, as appeared by the snow,\r\nthat was much stained with blood as they retreated.' The Parliamentary\r\nsoldiers remained in the church, and Sprigg, not unnaturally, vaunts\r\ntheir stoicism a little. 'They were resolved to continue in their duty;\r\nand notwithstanding the extremity of the cold, by reason of the great\r\nfrost and snow, and want of all means to resist or qualify the same in\r\nthe church, having no firing there, they would not quit the same till\r\nthey received orders to do so; which hard service (hard in every\r\nrespect) ... they were not immediately discharged of.' However, the next\r\nday, 'the general considering further the bitter coldness of the\r\nweather, and the hardness of the duty they would necessarily be put\r\nunto, if they should make good the church, sent orders to them to draw\r\noff, w^h that they might do with the more safety, two regiments were\r\nappointed to draw down and alarm the enemy on that side Excester, while\r\nthey made good their retreat over the river.'\r\n\r\nPowderham held out gallantly for more than another month,\r\nnotwithstanding that 'Colonel Hammond was set down with some force'\r\nabout it; and Fairfax, on his return from his victory at Dartmouth,\r\n'marched to Chidley, endeavouring first to take a view of Pouldrum,'\r\nmeditating a fresh attack. But the garrison had reached their limit of\r\nendurance, and the same night (January 24, 1646) the Castle was\r\nsurrendered.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1700 great alterations were made, and now battlemented\r\ntowers and French windows, iron balconies, and loopholes in massive\r\nwalls many feet thick, in strange juxtaposition, show how it has been\r\nadapted to the taste and needs of its successive owners. On the west is\r\na large courtyard, the Castle itself forming one side of the quadrangle;\r\non the east, a broad terrace, set with little box-edged beds, high\r\nvases, and clipped cypresses, and little turrets at the angles. Smaller\r\nterraces run north and south of the Castle, and along the south terrace\r\nis a magnificent thick, high, and very dense yew-hedge. The centre of\r\nthe east front is a low tower, and at each end are projecting wings. In\r\nthe south wing is the present chapel, once a granary. Perhaps its most\r\nuncommon feature is the number of old bench-ends, most of whose panels\r\nare carved with heads, some of which were shaped piously, though others\r\nare grotesque. Through the chapel is the priest's room, a large and\r\ndelightful one, lighted on three sides; with Pope Gregory in stained\r\nglass, and the Courtenay arms beneath, in one window.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the 'staircase hall' are a pale blue-green, and show a bold\r\nand very elaborate decoration, a belated example of the manner of\r\nGrinling Gibbons. Long white garlands, holding together flowers, fruit,\r\nspears, a quiver of arrows, birds, beasts, trumpets, and a mass of\r\nintricate designs, hang down the walls in high relief. The fine\r\nbanqueting-hall has a carved and vaulted roof, and high at one end is a\r\ngallery. Deep panelling runs all round the hall, and at the head of the\r\npanels are little shields, the coats of arms of the English and French\r\nbranches of the Courtenays, and of the ladies whom the successive heads\r\nof the family have married--with, in every case, the shields of her\r\nparents and grandparents as well. The heraldic chimneypiece is high and\r\nvery elaborate. In the long drawing-rooms hang two examples of the few\r\nlife-size groups that Richard Cosway painted. Both pictures are of three\r\ndaughters of the house; the dresses are white, and the whole colouring\r\nextremely delicate. In the most delightful of the two the ladies are\r\nstanding, and their figures and attitudes are extremely graceful. In the\r\nsecond picture all three are sitting on the ground, and though very\r\npretty, this group has not the particular charm of the first. The large\r\n'music-room' has been arranged to suit its name, for on the walls are\r\ntiny frescoes representing the triumph of Music, musical instruments are\r\nsculptured in marble on the chimneypiece, and even pattern the Aubusson\r\ncarpet. In the panelled entrance-hall is some fine carving, and here\r\nhang the rather melancholy portraits of the unhappy Marquis of Exeter\r\nand his unfortunate son, and a large picture of a Lord and Lady Devon,\r\nmost of their fourteen daughters, and their only son.\r\n\r\nPowderham was brought to the Courtenays as the dowry of Margaret Bohun,\r\ndaughter of the Earl of Hereford, and she left it to her fifth son, Sir\r\nPhilip Courtenay, the ancestor of the present owner.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible here to attempt the most imperfect outline of the\r\nchanging fortunes of this 'imperial family,' even from the date at which\r\nthey settled in England, and without any reference to the days when\r\nCourtenays were Kings of Jerusalem and Emperors of Constantinople.\r\nMembers of this family have played important parts in different crises\r\nof the nation's history, and very many have been eminent in peace and\r\nwar. From the chronicle of their lives and losses, battles and honours,\r\nI am able to quote here only a few scattered instances.\r\n\r\nSir Hugh Courtenay, born 1327, was often 'employed by the King in his\r\nwars in _France_ and _Scotland_,' and fought at the battle of Crecy. The\r\nnext year, among other 'brave Martialists,' he diverted himself by mimic\r\nbattles at Eltham, and it is recorded that at this tournament the King\r\ngave him 'an Hood of White Cloth, embroidered with men in the posture of\r\nDancers, buttoned with large Pearls.' Authorities are divided as to\r\nwhether he or his father, the Earl of Devonshire, was one of the\r\nfounders of the Order of the Garter. Sir Hugh's son of the same name\r\nmarried Matilda, daughter of the Earl of Kent, and his wife--usually\r\nknown as the Fair Maid of Kent, Lady Matilda Courtenay--inherited her\r\nmother's beauty--'\"the fairest lady in England,\" saith Froissard.' Hugh\r\nCourtenay died young, and his widow fell in love with 'Lord _Valeran_,\r\nEarl of _St Paul_, who, having been taken Prisoner in the Marches of\r\n_Calais_, was kept in the English Court, and by his winning Behaviour\r\ndid much engage the Ladies Affections to him. The Princess her Mother\r\n[who as a widow had married the Black Prince] was at first much against\r\nthe match, but at last she yielded, and the king her brother gave his\r\nconsent, and for her dowry bestowed upon the Earl the Manor of Byfleet.\r\n_Walsington_ says that this marriage was celebrated on the Octaves of\r\nEaster, at Windsor, with great Pomp, and the Earl got from France a\r\ngreat many Musicians and Dancers for that purpose.'\r\n\r\nSir Hugh was the eldest of seventeen children, and several of the sons\r\nwere distinguished men. On the eve of the Battle of Navaretto, Sir Hugh,\r\nSir Philip, and Sir Peter were knighted together by the Black Prince.\r\nTheir eagerness to fight on land or sea led, on one occasion, to an\r\nunfortunate result. In 1378 the Duke of Lancaster was exasperating the\r\nfleet under his orders by his 'slow Proceedings and unnecessary delays,'\r\nand a part of it set out without him. 'Sir Philip and Sir Peter\r\nCourtenay, two brothers who had the Command of some ships, espying some\r\nvessels belonging to the enemy, inconsiderately assaulted them, being\r\nthe whole Spanish Fleet, and though they bravely fought, and defended\r\nthemselves, yet in the end were beaten, most of them who were good\r\ngentlemen of Devonshire and Somersetshire being slain. Sir Peter with\r\nsome others were taken Prisoners, and Sir Philip was sore wounded but\r\nescaped the hands of his enemies.'\r\n\r\nLater on Sir Philip was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and must have\r\nwrestled with enough turbulence and riot to satisfy anyone. His manner\r\nof governing seems, at any rate, to have pleased the King, who, whilst\r\nSir Philip was still in office, showered honours upon him--'the Park of\r\nBovey Tracey ... Dartmoor Forest, and the Manour of Bradnich.' He was\r\nmade 'Steward of all the King's Manours and Stannaries in the county of\r\nCornwall,' and later on was appointed to other posts of importance.\r\nUnluckily, Sir Philip's chief principle of action seems to have been\r\nthat might is right, and complaints being made to the King that he had\r\nexpelled two of his neighbours from parts of their lands, and imprisoned\r\nthe Abbot of Newenham, and two of his monks, 'with great force,' the\r\nintrepid knight was sent to the Tower. However, after a little while,\r\n'at the request of the Lords and Commons, he was restored to his place\r\nand good name.'\r\n\r\nWilliam Courtenay, a brother to Sir Philip, was Bishop of London at the\r\ncritical time when Wyclif's doctrines were first stirring men's minds,\r\nand after the murder of Archbishop Sudbury, Bishop Courtenay was\r\ntranslated to Canterbury, and began to take very severe measures against\r\nthe heretics. A strange event marked a meeting of many dignitaries of\r\nChurch and State, who had gathered to censure Wyclif's teaching and find\r\nmeans for its extermination. 'When they were just going to begin their\r\nbusiness a wonderful and terrible earthquake happened throughout all\r\nEngland, whereupon differs of the suffragans being affrighted thought\r\nfit to leave off their business, but the Archbishop encouraged them to\r\ngo on, and they proceeded to examine Articles of Wickliff, and to give\r\ntheir censure upon them.'\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop persuaded Parliament to pass an Act against certain\r\npreachers of heresy, that they might be arrested and kept 'in strong\r\nPrison until they shall justify themselves according to the Law of the\r\nHoly Church,' and brought the Chancellor of Oxford literally to his\r\nknees, begging the Archbishop's pardon for having shown favour to the\r\nLollards against special commands.\r\n\r\nHis strong will was exercised in all matters, great and small, and\r\noffenders were punished in the most conspicuous fashion. The Archbishop\r\ntook a high hand in dealing with affairs of the Diocese of Exeter, and\r\nthe Bishop of Exeter greatly resented it, and appealed against him to\r\nRome. The Archbishop then 'cited' Bishop Brantyngham 'to answer certain\r\nArticles to be proposed to him in the Visitation,' but some of the\r\n'Bishop's Officers' met the bearer at Topsham, and 'did beat him, and\r\nforced him to eat the Citation, Parchment, Wax, and all.' The contempt\r\nof his commands, and the maltreatment of his messenger, naturally roused\r\nthe Archbishop to wrath, and he inflicted this very heavy penance: 'That\r\nin the Church of _Canterbury_, _St Paul's_ in _London_, and the\r\nCathedral Church of _Exeter_, they should upon three Holy Days named,\r\nbeing in their shirts only, in a Procession going before the Cross,\r\ncarry Wax Tapers burning in their hands, and then that they should give\r\nto the Priest a Salary to say Mass every day at the Tomb of the Earl of\r\nDevonshire; and lastly, every one of them was enjoined to pay a sum of\r\nmoney, for repairing the Walls of the City of _Exeter_.' In addition to\r\nthe public disgrace, the trouble and cost of this penance must have been\r\nimmense.\r\n\r\nThe sixth of these brothers, Sir Peter Courtenay, was, says Fuller, 'a\r\ntrue son of Mars and actuated with such heroic fire, that he wholly\r\naddicted himself unto feats of arms.' It has been already mentioned that\r\nhe fought in the Spanish wars, and in milder moments he distinguished\r\nhimself at 'justs and tournaments now justled out of fashion by your\r\ncarpet knights.' As a prisoner of war in France, his captivity was\r\nlightened by the attentions he received, even from the King of France\r\nhimself, and he was on such good terms with his captors that after his\r\nrelease he gained leave of Richard II 'to send into France, by\r\nNorthampton Herald, and by Anlet Pursuivant, as a return for the\r\ncivilities he received in France ... eight cloths of Scarlet, Black and\r\nRusset, to give to certain Noblemen of that Realm; as also two Horses,\r\nsix saddles, six little bows, one sheaf of large Arrows and another\r\nsheaf of Cross-bow Arrows; likewise a Greyhound, and other dogs for the\r\nKing of France's Keeper.'\r\n\r\nThe Wars of the Roses were especially fatal to the House of Courtenay,\r\nno less than three Earls of Devon losing their lives for King Henry, and\r\nin consequence the elder branch of the family became extinct.\r\n\r\nA pleasanter time to look back upon was the beginning of the reign of\r\nHenry VIII. Henry VII had married Elizabeth, the elder, and the Earl of\r\nDevonshire Katherine, the younger, of Edward IV's daughters, and after\r\nHenry VIII's accession to the throne the Earl of Devonshire seems to\r\nhave been much at Court. In the early months of 1509 preparations were\r\nmade for 'solemn Justs in Honour of the Queen. The King was one, and\r\nwith him three Aids: the King was called _Coeur Loial_, and the Earl\r\nof _Devonshire_, _Bon Voloire_, Sir _Thomas Nevet_, _Bon Espoire_, Sir\r\n_Edward Nevil_, _Valiant Desire_, and their Names were put in a fine\r\nTable, and the Table was hung on a Tree curiously wrought, and they were\r\ncalled _Les Chevaliers de le Forest Salvigne_, and they were to run at\r\nthe Tilt with all comers.'\r\n\r\nThe irony of the King's choice of a _nom de guerre_ seems to have\r\nescaped the historian.\r\n\r\n'On the 1st day of _May_ 1510, 2 Henry VIII, the King, accompanied with\r\na great many valiant Nobles, rode upon managed Horses to the Wood to\r\nfetch May, where he and three others, viz., Sir _Edward Howard_,\r\n_Charles Brandon_, and _Edward Nevil_, which were Challengers, shifted\r\nthemselves, and did put on coats of green Sattin, guarded with crimson\r\nVelvet; and on the other side were the Earls of _Essex_ and\r\n_Devonshire_, the Marquis of _Dorset_, and the Lord _Howard_, and they\r\nwere all in crimson Sattin, guarded with a pounced Guard of green\r\nVelvet. On the third Day the Queen made a great Banquet for the King and\r\nthose who had justed, and after the Banquet she gave the Chief Prize to\r\nthe King, the second to the Earl of _Essex_, the third to the Earl of\r\n_Devonshire_, and the Fourth to the Marquess of _Dorset_. Then the\r\nHeralds cried aloud, _My Lords, For your noble Feats in Arms, God send\r\nyou the Love of the Ladies whom you most admire_.'\r\n\r\nThe next year the Earl of Devonshire died, and was succeeded by his son,\r\nHenry, who for a time was high in the favour of his royal cousin. He\r\nseems also to have taken part in many 'Justs and Tourneys.' One summer\r\n'the Queen desired the King to bring to his Manour of Havering in Essex,\r\nto the Bower there, the Gentlemen of _France_ that were Hostages, for\r\nwhose Welcome she provided all things in a liberal manner.' The\r\nentertainment seems to have taken the shape of a small masked ball, and\r\n'the King gave many gifts where he liked.' At the Field of the Cloth of\r\nGold, the Earl of Devonshire had the honour of tilting with the French\r\nKing, 'and they ran so hard together that both their Spears broke, and\r\nso they maintained their Courses nobly.'\r\n\r\nThe next year 'the King kept his _Christmas_ at _Greenwich_ in great\r\nsplendour'; and there was another tournament and many challenges. 'Noble\r\nand rich was their Apparel, but in Feats of Arms the King excelled the\r\nrest.'\r\n\r\nIn the year 1525 the Earl was created Marquis of Exeter, and seven years\r\nlater, before starting for France, the King formally named his cousin\r\nHeir Apparent to the Crown. After this Fortune turned her back on him,\r\nand though, at the King's bidding, he dealt with the northern rebels,\r\ntaking with him 'a jolly company of Western Men, well and completely\r\nappointed,' it was thought that his power, shown by 'so sudden raising\r\ndivers thousands,' awoke the King's jealousy. The influence of the\r\nMarquis 'over the west was second only to the hold which the Duke of\r\nNorfolk had upon the eastern counties'; and therefore, when two years\r\nlater it was reported he had said, 'Knaves rule about the King. I trust\r\nto give them a buffet one day,' Cromwell was glad to seize the\r\nopportunity of simultaneously striking at feudalism in the West, and of\r\ndealing a blow at the inflexible Cardinal Pole, the Courtenays' kinsman.\r\nThe Marquis was at once arrested on the charge of being an accomplice of\r\nthe Cardinal, and was beheaded on Tower Hill.\r\n\r\nEdward, his son, who was only twelve years old at the time of his\r\nfather's death, was committed to the Tower, 'lest he should raise\r\nCommotions by revenging his Father's Quarrel,' and here he remained for\r\ntwenty-seven years. There is a pretty account of Queen Mary coming to\r\nthe Tower, soon after her accession, where '_Thomas_, Duke of _Norfolk_,\r\nDr _Gardiner_, late Bishop of _Winchester_, _Edward Courtenay_, son and\r\nheir to _Henry Marquis_ of _Exeter_, the _Dutchess of Somerset_,\r\nPrisoners in the Tower, kneeling on the Hill, within the same Tower,\r\nsaluted her Grace, and she came to them and kissed them, and said,\r\n\"These be my prisoners,\" and caused them presently to be set at\r\nliberty.'\r\n\r\nThe very next day the Queen restored to her cousin the title of Earl of\r\nDevon (forfeited by his father's attainder), and soon after all his\r\nlands that remained in her possession, and also showed him other\r\nfavours. In fact, 'it was reported that she carried some good affections\r\ntowards the Earl, from the first time that she saw him.... Concerning\r\nwhich, there goes a story that the young Earl petitioning the Queen for\r\nleave to travel, she advised him to marry and stay at home, assuring him\r\nthat no lady in the land, how high soever, would refuse to accept of him\r\nfor a husband, by which words, she pointed out herself to him, as\r\nplainly as might either stand with the Modesty or Majesty of a Maiden\r\nQueen.' But, says Fuller with extreme candour, 'either because his long\r\ndurance had some influence on his brain, or that naturally his face was\r\nbetter than his head, or out of some private fancy and affection (which\r\nis most probable) to the Lady Elizabeth,' who, another writer declares,\r\n'of that moderate Share of Beauty that was between them, had much the\r\nbetter of her,' the Earl evaded the honour hinted to him, and begged\r\nleave to pay his addresses to the younger Princess. The Queen's feelings\r\nand vanity were deeply wounded, and, on a suspicion that the Princess as\r\nwell as himself were concerned in Wyatt's rebellion, they were both sent\r\nto the Tower.\r\n\r\nCleaveland tells a charming story of the Princess and of a child who\r\nlived in the Tower. 'During the time that the Lady Elizabeth and the\r\nLord Courtenay were in Prison, a little boy, the son of a Man that lived\r\nin the Tower, did use to resort unto their chambers and did often bring\r\nher Grace Flowers, as he did to the other Prisoners that were there,\r\nwhereupon some suspicious heads, thinking to make something of it, on a\r\nTime called the Child unto them, promising him Figs and Apples, and\r\nasked him when he had been with the Earl of _Devonshire_, knowing that\r\nhe did use to go to him: The Boy answered, _That he would go by and by\r\nthither_. Then they demanded of him, when he was with the Lady\r\n_Elizabeth_? He answered _Every Day_. Then they asked him, what the\r\nLord _Devonshire_ sent by him to her Grace? The Child said, _I will go\r\nand know what he will give to carry to her_; such was the discretion of\r\nthe child (says Mr _Fox_), being but four Years of Age. _This same is a\r\ncrafty Boy_, said the Lord Chamberlain; _How say you, my lord Shandois?\r\nI pray you, my Lord_, says the Boy, _give me the Figs you promised me;\r\nNo_, quoth the Lord, _thou shalt be whipt, if thou come any more to the\r\nLady Elizabeth or the Lord Courtenay_. The Boy answered, _I will bring\r\nmy Lady and Mistress more flowers_, whereupon the Child's Father was\r\ncommanded to permit the Boy to come no more up into the chambers. The\r\nnext Day, as her Grace was walking in the Garden, the Child peeping in\r\nat a Hole in the Door, cried unto her, _Mistress, I can bring no more\r\nflowers_: Whereat she smiled, but said nothing, understanding thereby\r\nwhat they had done. Soon after the Chamberlain rebuked highly his\r\nFather, commanding him to put him out of the House; _Alas! poor Infant_,\r\nsaid the Father: _It is a crafty Knave_, quoth the Lord Chamberlain,\r\n_let me see him here no more_.'\r\n\r\nSoon after Queen Mary's marriage, her husband tried hard to persuade her\r\nto release her sister and the Earl, 'and nothing, says _Heylin_, did\r\nKing _Philip_ more Honour amongst the _English_.' It is to be remembered\r\nto his good, that he interceded very earnestly, and in the end\r\nsuccessfully, for another Devonshire conspirator in Wyatt's rising, Sir\r\nPeter Carew.\r\n\r\nThe Earl, fearing that he might, 'upon the first disorder, be committed\r\nto the Tower, to which his Stars seemed to condemn him,' prudently\r\nresolved to go abroad; but he must have been born under a very unlucky\r\nplanet, for the next year he was seized with illness, and died at Padua.\r\nWith him the title became extinct for about two hundred and fifty years;\r\nthen Lord Courtenay, a descendant of the Powderham branch of Courtenays,\r\nestablished his claim to the earldom. As the attainder of the Marquis of\r\nExeter was never reversed, that title was never revived in this family.\r\n\r\nAmong the 'Roxburghe Ballads' is one relating to the Courtenays, called\r\n'The Stout Cripple of Cornwall.' No notes throw any light upon the\r\npossible origin of the story or offer any opinion as to the probability\r\nof the ballad being an account of a true incident, or 'founded on fact,'\r\nor wholly imaginary.\r\n\r\n    'Of a stout Cripple that kept the highway,\r\n    And beg'd for his living all time of the day,\r\n    A story I'll tell you that pleasant shall be--\r\n    The Cripple of Cornwall sirnaméd was he.\r\n\r\n    'He crept on his hands and his knees up and downe,\r\n    In a torn jacket and ragged patcht gowne;\r\n    For he had never a leg to the knee--\r\n    The Cripple of Cornwall sirnaméd was he.\r\n\r\n    'He was of stomake courageious and stout,\r\n    For he had no cause to complaine of the gout;\r\n    To go upon stilts most cunning was he,\r\n    With a staff on his neck most gallant and free.\r\n\r\n    'Yea, no good-fellowship would he forsake,\r\n    Were it in secret a purse to take,\r\n    His help was as good as any might be,\r\n    The Cripple of Cornwall sirnaméd was he.\r\n\r\n    'When he upon any such service did go,\r\n    The crafty young Cripple provided it so,\r\n    His tools he kept close in an old hollow tree,\r\n    That stood from the city a mile, two or three.\r\n\r\n    'Thus all the day long he beg'd for relief,\r\n    And late in the night he play'd the false theefe,\r\n    And seven years together this custom kept he,\r\n    And no man thought him such a person to be.\r\n\r\n    'There were few graziers who went on the way,\r\n    But unto the Cripple for passage did pay.\r\n    And every brave merchant that he did descry,\r\n    He emptied their purses ere they passed by.\r\n\r\n    'The gallant Lord Courtenay, both valiant and bold,\r\n    Rode forth with great plenty of silver and gold,\r\n    At Exeter there (for) a purchase to pay,\r\n    But that the false Cripple his journey did stay.\r\n\r\n    'For why, the false Cripple heard tidings of late,\r\n    As he lay for almes at this noble-man's gate,\r\n    What day and what houre his journey should be;\r\n    \"This is,\" quoth the Cripple, \"a booty for me.\"\r\n\r\n    'Then to his companions this matter he moved,\r\n    Which he in like actions before-time had proved;\r\n    They make themselves ready, and deeply they sweare,\r\n    This money's their own, before they come there.\r\n\r\n    'Upon his two stilts the Cripple doth mount,\r\n    To have the best share he makes his account;\r\n    All clothed in canvas downe to the ground,\r\n    He takes up his standing, his mates with him round.\r\n\r\n    'Then comes the Lord Courtenay, with half a score men,\r\n    That little suspected these thieves in their den,\r\n    And they (thus) perceiving them come to their hand,\r\n    In a darke (winter's) evening, they bid him to stand.\r\n\r\n    '\"Deliver thy purse,\" quoth the Cripple, \"with speed--\r\n    For we be good fellows and thereof have need.\"\r\n    \"Not so,\" quoth Lord Countenay, \"but this I'll tell ye,\r\n    Win it and wear it, else get none of me.\"\r\n\r\n    'With that the Lord Courtenay stood on his defence,\r\n    And so did his servants; but ere they went hence,\r\n    Two of the true men were slain in the fight,\r\n    And four of the thieves were put to the flight.\r\n\r\n    'And while for their safeguard they run thus away,\r\n    The jolly bold Cripple did hold the rest play,\r\n    And with his pikestaff he wounded them so,\r\n    As they were unable to run or to go.\r\n\r\n    'With fighting the Lord Courtney was driven out of breath,\r\n    And most of his servants were wounded to death,\r\n    Then came other horsemen riding so fast,\r\n    The Cripple was forced to flye at the last.\r\n\r\n    'And over a river that ran there beside,\r\n    Which was very deep and eighteen foot wide,\r\n    With his long staff and his stilts leaped he,\r\n    And shifted himself in an old hollow tree.\r\n\r\n    'Then through the country was hue and cry made,\r\n    To have these bold thieves apprehended and staid;\r\n    The Cripple he creep on his hands and his knees,\r\n    And on the hieway great posting he sees.\r\n\r\n    'And as they came riding, he begging doth say,\r\n    \"O give me one penny, good masters, I pray;\"\r\n    And thus on to Exeter creeps he along,\r\n    No man suspecting that he had done wrong.\r\n\r\n    'Anon the Lord Courtney he spies in the street,\r\n    He comes unto him and he kisses his feet,\r\n    Saying, \"God save your honour and keep you from ill,\r\n    And from the hands of your enemies still!\"\r\n\r\n    '\"Amen!\" quoth Lord Courtney, and therewith flung downe\r\n    Unto the poor Cripple an English crowne;\r\n    Away went the Cripple, and thus did he thinke,\r\n    \"Five hundred pound more would make me to drinke.\"\r\n\r\n    'In vain that hue and cry it was made,\r\n    They found none of them, though the country was laid;\r\n    But this grieved the Cripple both night and by day,\r\n    That he so unluckily mist of his prey.\r\n\r\n    'Nine hundred pound this Cripple had got,\r\n    By begging and thieving--so good was his lot--\r\n    \"A thousand pound he would make it,\" he said,\r\n    \"And then he would quite give over his trade.\"\r\n\r\n    'But as he (thus) strived his mind to fulfill.\r\n    In following his actions so lewd and so ill,\r\n    At last he was taken, the law to suffice,\r\n    Condemned and hanged at Exeter 'size.\r\n\r\n    'Which made all men greatly amazed to see,\r\n    That such an impotent person as he\r\n    Should venture himself in such actions as they,\r\n    To rob in such sort upon the hye-way.'\r\n\r\nOn a hill about two miles east of Totnes stand the ruins of Berry\r\nPomeroy, at a little distance almost hidden in the thick woods around\r\nthem. Vistas of green leaves without end open from the road to the\r\ncastle, long lines of beeches and oaks stretching out of sight and\r\nbroken by glades chequered with flickering lights and shadows. On the\r\nnorth and east side of the walls the ground falls away precipitously to\r\na great depth, and a stream runs along the valley beneath. The ruins are\r\ncovered with ivy, saplings and bushes spread their fresh shoots and\r\nsprays among the crumbling stones, and all is open to the sky; but\r\nenough remains to show what a noble building Berry Pomeroy must have\r\nbeen. The outer walls of the Castle were built by the Pomeroys--it is\r\nthought probable by Henry de Pomeroy, in the reign of King John, though\r\nthe Castle was granted them by William the Conqueror. A hexagonal tower\r\nflanks the gateway on either side. Above it is the guard-room, in which\r\ntwo pillars support circular arches that are in a very perfect\r\ncondition, and the grooves in the walls for the portcullis may easily be\r\ntraced. It is usually reported that the Pomeroys' coat of arms is still\r\nvisible on the gateway, but as the lodge-keeper, who for many years has\r\ntrimmed the ivy at intervals, has never seen it, it may be that a little\r\nimagination has come to the help of mere eyesight.\r\n\r\nA curtain wall connects the gateway with a tower called St Margaret's\r\nTower, of which merely the shell remains, smothered in overhanging ivy,\r\nbrambles, long grass, and a tapestry of plants, and beneath the tower is\r\na small, dark dungeon. To the left, across the quadrangle and along the\r\nwestern wall, are a number of rooms more or less imperfect that belonged\r\nto the Pomeroys' castle. They lead one into another, and contain\r\nenormous fireplaces and chimneys. Opposite the gateway the ruins are\r\nmuch more broken down, in parts hardly more than fragments and tall\r\ntrees peer over a low wall, the crowning point of a very steep ascent.\r\n\r\nJust inside the gateway, on the right, is the skeleton of the splendid\r\nwest front, due to Sir Edward Seymour. The inner buildings, which rose\r\nin Tudor days, are of a character entirely different from that of the\r\nolder remains, and the Seymours' spacious ideas were reflected in the\r\nmagnificence of their castle. The windows and traces of fireplaces in\r\nthe walls show that it must have been four stories high and held a maze\r\nof rooms. One becomes confused wandering through enclosed spaces,\r\ncell-like, for the great height, unbroken by floor or ceiling, gives an\r\nimpression that the rooms are small. Over all is an uncomfortable sense\r\nof desertion, and the high empty windows, with stone mullions and square\r\nlabels, somehow give a skull-like appearance to the frame of the west\r\nfront. There is not the feeling of repose that there is about some\r\nruins, which seem to disown their debt to man, and to be bent on\r\npretending that they are as entirely a work of Nature as any\r\nlichen-covered boulder lying near them. I do not know if Berry Pomeroy\r\nis said to be haunted, but it awakens an uneasy sensation that it is\r\nitself a ghost--the ghost of an unsatisfied ambition, the creation of\r\nmany minds who planned and toiled, soared and fell.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the Seymours' castle was never finished, and it is\r\ncurious that, as it was destroyed in comparatively recent times, there\r\nshould be no account of such an important event. The theory most usually\r\naccepted is that it was burned by lightning; but there is no absolute\r\nproof that this was the case.\r\n\r\nOf the Pomeroys of Berry Pomeroy few records of much importance remain.\r\nRalph de la Pomerai was so 'greatly assistant to William the Conqueror'\r\nin subduing this kingdom, that no less than fifty-eight lordships in\r\nDevonshire were awarded him. Henry de Pomeroy, in the reign of King\r\nJohn, was a powerful and rebellious noble, who must have been a terror\r\nto his weaker neighbours. Occasional glimpses of this family are given\r\nby old deeds and papers, as, for instance, in 1267, when a 'Pardon' was\r\ngranted by 'Edward, eldest son of the king, to Sir Henry de la Pomeroy,\r\nwho was against the king in the late disturbances in the kingdom.' About\r\nthe same date is a grant by Sir Henry, 'for the health of his soul,' of\r\nthe Manor of Canonteign, the advowsons of four churches, and 'other\r\npossessions to the Prior and Convent of the Blessed Mary of Martin ...\r\nby ordinance of Walter, Bishop of Exeter.'\r\n\r\nSome years later Edward I, now King, sent a second pardon to Sir Henry\r\n'and Joan, his wife, for detaining Isabella, daughter and one of the\r\nheirs of John de Moles, deceased, and marrying her against the king's\r\nwill to William de Botreaux, the younger.' So that he appears to have\r\nfollowed his own pleasure with extreme independence.\r\n\r\nA note on a more peaceful subject is extracted from the Testa de Nevil:\r\n'Geoffrey de la Worthy holds one tenement, four acres of land and a\r\nhalf, and two gardens of Henry de la Pomeroye, in Bery, rendering at\r\nEaster and Midsummer four shillings and nine pence, and one pound of wax\r\nand three capons, the price of the wax sixpence, and the capons one\r\npenny.' One penny!\r\n\r\nThe terms of settling several other disputes are preserved--in one case\r\nat great length. In the reign of Henry VII, Sir Edward Pomeroy fell out\r\nwith 'the Mayor of Totnes and his brethren'; several gentlemen\r\narbitrated between them, and eventually 'awarded that the said Sir\r\nEdward Pomeroy shall clearly exclude, forgive, and put from him all\r\nmalice and debates ... and from hensforth to be loving unto theym,' and\r\nthe same conciliatory spirit was to be shown by the other side. As a\r\nreally satisfactory conclusion, Sir Edward was desired to send the Mayor\r\nand his brethren a buck to be eaten in state, 'Provided that the same\r\nSir Edward be at the etyng of the same bucke, in goodly manner.\r\nFurthermore we award that the said maiour and his brethren shal paye for\r\nthe wyne which shal be dronke at the etyng of the same bucke.'\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Pomeroy, the last of this family to own the Castle, fell into\r\ndisgrace through joining in the Western rebellion against the\r\nPrayer-Book, and his estate passed to the Protector Somerset.\r\n\r\nIt would be absurd in this chapter to attempt to touch on more than a\r\nvery few points in the history of the great family of the Seymours, or\r\nto touch on any that are not connected with Devonshire. Amongst the Duke\r\nof Somerset's papers are some extremely interesting letters and\r\ndocuments relating to Sir Edward Seymour's descendants in this county.\r\nThe second wife of the Protector Somerset, Ann Stanhope, is described in\r\nno flattering terms, one biographer attributing some of the Duke's later\r\ntroubles to 'the pride, the haughty hate, the unquiet vanity of a\r\n_mannish_, or rather of a _divellish_, woman.' Haywood says she was\r\n'subtle and violent in accomplishing her ends, and for pride,\r\nmonstrous.' It can easily be imagined, therefore, that she persuaded the\r\nDuke to set aside her stepson in favour of her own eldest son; but all\r\nthe honours that should have passed to him were forfeited by the\r\nattainder of the Duke. The title of Earl of Hertford was, however,\r\nrestored to Ann Stanhope's son in the reign of James I.\r\n\r\nThe true heir, Sir Edward Seymour, to whose descendants the dukedom has\r\nnow reverted, was given Berry Pomeroy by his father. His grandson,\r\nEdward, showed great zeal in making ready the defences of the coast when\r\nthe Armada was expected, and from various letters, orders, and\r\n'precepts,' it is obvious that these preparations brought him great\r\nresponsibility and an immense amount of work. In 1586 a letter was\r\nforwarded to him from the Lord-Lieutenant in reference to the 'beacon\r\nwatches.' Instructions were sent that 'one, two, or three horses for\r\npost' should be kept at a convenient place near each beacon, that one or\r\nmore might be ready to start at a moment's notice if the signal were\r\ngiven. Further directions were: 'That the wisest and discreetest men of\r\nevery parish be appointed to assist the constables; ... Commandment to\r\nevery person within every parish that they do not [set any furze or]\r\nheath on fire after seven of the clock in the afternoon.' And there were\r\na host of orders regarding 'the trained soldiers, and also all others\r\nmustered and charged with armour.'\r\n\r\nLater Colonel Seymour was called into council with the Earl of Bath, the\r\nLord-Lieutenant of the county, and others, to draw up orders as to\r\nstores of 'powder, match, and lead,' that 'one moiety more of each sort'\r\nbe kept in towns than was previously ordered, and that 'armour, weapons,\r\nhorses, and other necessary furnitures for the wars be held in perfect\r\nreadiness ... for all sudden service without defect.'\r\n\r\nHis grandson, another Sir Edward, was a very loyal and devoted servant\r\nof Charles I. In 1643 he was given full power and authority in His\r\nMajesty's name 'to impress, raise, enroll, and retain one regiment of\r\n1,500 foot soldiers;' and in the following August he was appointed to\r\nthe important post of Governor of Dartmouth. Besides supervising\r\nthe garrison and the defences of the town, this officer was\r\nrequired to raise loans, supply ordnance, ammunition, and other\r\nnecessaries--sometimes even troops--to captains in the neighbourhood. He\r\nwas also desired to do his best to provide money and 'sea-victuals' for\r\nships going out in the King's service, and received particular\r\ninstructions from the King to prevent any 'ships, vessels, prizes, or\r\nanything belonging to them,' that might be captured, from being\r\nplundered or disposed of before they had been 'legally adjudicated by\r\nthe judge of our Admiralty there ... for the time being.'\r\n\r\nThe tone of letters that passed between certain generals, Royalist and\r\nPuritan, about this date, furnishes an additional reason for mourning\r\nthe tragedies of the time. The following letter is from the Earl of\r\nWarwick to Colonel Seymour:\r\n\r\n     'IN TORBAY, ABOARD THE _James_,\r\n\r\n     '1644, _July_ 18.\r\n\r\n     'I return you my serious acknowledgment of your civility, and\r\n     should most gladly embrace an opportunity to serve you, not only\r\n     for your respects, but also for that ancient acquaintance I have\r\n     had with your noble family and the honour I have borne it, the\r\n     recalling whereof to memory adds to the trouble of our present\r\n     distance, which I hope God will, in due time, reconcile, so as the\r\n     mutual freedom of conversation which we sometimes enjoyed may be\r\n     restored, which I shall the more value as it may give me advantage\r\n     of testifying my esteem of you.... It is a pity the truth should be\r\n     clouded by some mis-informations that have overspread these parts.\r\n     God will in his time scatter them and undeceive those that wait\r\n     upon him for counsel.'\r\n\r\nA few days later, in Colonel Seymour's reply to this letter, he admits\r\nhe has been culpably generous to his adversary. 'Truly, for my own part,\r\nI had rather err with mercy than justice, for had not my lenity made me\r\na delinquent to duty, your Lordship had wanted some of Dartmouth now\r\naboard you.'\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the war a fine letter was written by Sir William\r\nWaller to his friend and present adversary, Lord Hopton:\r\n\r\n     'BATH,\r\n\r\n     '1643, _July_ 16.\r\n\r\n     'The experience I have had of your work, and the happiness I have\r\n     enjoyed in your friendship, are wounding considerations to me when\r\n     I look upon this present distance between us; certainly, my\r\n     affections to you are so unchangeable that hostility itself cannot\r\n     violate my friendship to your person, but I must be true to the\r\n     cause wherein I serve. The old limitation--_usque ad alias_--holds\r\n     still, and where my conscience is interested, all other\r\n     obligations are swallowed up. I should most gladly wait upon you,\r\n     according to your desire, but that I look upon you as engaged in\r\n     that party beyond the possibility of a retreat, and, consequently,\r\n     incapable of being wrought upon by my persuasions, and I know the\r\n     conference can never be so close between us but that it would take\r\n     wind and receive construction to my dishonour. That great God who\r\n     is the searcher of my heart, knows with what a sad sense I go on\r\n     upon this service, and with what a perfect hatred I detest this war\r\n     without an enemy, but I look upon it as _opus Dei_, which is enough\r\n     to silence all passion in me. The God of Peace, in his good time,\r\n     send us the blessing of peace, and, in the mean time, fit us to\r\n     receive it. We are both upon the stage, and must act the parts that\r\n     are assigned to us in this tragedy; let us do it in a way of honour\r\n     and without personal animosities.'\r\n\r\nLater, Colonel Seymour gave up the Governorship of Dartmouth, and was\r\nsucceeded by Sir Lewis Pollard.\r\n\r\nAmong the Seymour papers are some interesting notes, dated '1645, May\r\n22,' relating to horses and arms raised in the Hundred of Stanborough.\r\n'Mr Bampfield, parson, will bring a horse and arms to-morrow at\r\nBerry.... John Key of Rattery affirms that he hath three horses in the\r\nKing's service; that he hath one mare only, which he proffers; his\r\nestate not above 40 li. per annum, and hath no money. Dipford:--Mr\r\nWilliam Fowell, late of Dipford Downs, assessed a horse and arms\r\ncomplete; his wife appears; says that Prince Maurice had one horse and\r\nCaptain Newton had another for a country horse very lately; all the\r\nanswer. Mr John Newton doth not appear. Buckfastleigh:--Mr Richard Cable\r\nhath brought one gelding with all arms, only a carbine instead of\r\npistols, and no rider. Dortington:--Mr Champernowne brought a little\r\npretty fat old horse, but nothing else.'\r\n\r\nIn 1647 Colonel Seymour's lands and goods were sequestrated, and he\r\nhimself was kept either in prison or on parole all through Cromwell's\r\ndays. Letters and papers of this period shed a light on the difficulties\r\nand hardships that in some cases befell the families of Cavaliers. Sir\r\nThomas Fairfax intervened on behalf of Mistress Seymour, who was then\r\nat the estate of Maiden Bradley in Wiltshire, saying that he had\r\nforbidden the soldiers to molest her in any way, and begging the\r\nCommittee for the County to insure that no civilian 'should prejudice\r\nher in the enjoyment of her rights.' The lady had a humbler but very\r\nearnest advocate, a servant of Sir Henry Ludlow's, who had been in\r\ndanger of being ruined 'had she not been means for my preservation.' She\r\nhad begged his liberty of Colonel Molesworth when the King's soldiers\r\nwere hunting for him, in order to exchange him for one of their side\r\ntaken prisoner, 'a blackamoor.' Mistress Seymour, too, gave this poor\r\nman a good price for some wheat, 'which then none else would do, and had\r\nshe not bought it, it is very likely that it would have been taken away\r\nby the soldiers, as the corn in the barn was.'\r\n\r\nMistress Seymour was evidently strong-minded as well as charitable, as\r\nis shown in a letter written by her husband from the Marshalsea, at\r\nExeter,--an appeal to be given a hearing. He complains that being\r\n'hurried away to prison and no bail taken, no crime or accusation\r\nproduced, makes me sigh when I remember the liberty due to a freeborn\r\nsubject in England'; and the thrust is followed by a threat: 'If this\r\nrequest be denied, I have found a way to be even with them; for, if not\r\ngranted, I intend to send up my wife.... And I pray advise the Council\r\nof State from me, in relation to their own quiet, let them grant my\r\nrequest rather than be punished with her importunity.'\r\n\r\nThe Council were evidently impressed by Colonel Seymour's wisdom, for\r\ntwo months later they granted him a pass to return home. His liberty\r\nwas, however, very much clipped, and rather more than two years later\r\nthe following 'parole' was exacted of him: 'Undertaking to remain at the\r\ndwelling-house of Mr Holt in Exeter, and when required to deliver\r\nhimself a prisoner to Captain Unton Crooke.' _Signed._\r\n\r\nSir Edward Seymour died in 1659, and Colonel Seymour, now Sir Edward,\r\nbecame a member of Parliament a year or so later. His letters to Lady\r\nSeymour from London are amusing from their variety of news and gossip.\r\nSir Edward's style was terse, not to say jerky. One letter he begins by\r\nbitter complaints of their 'most undutiful son,' his 'obstinacy' and\r\n'untowardness,' and then passes on to speak of his own imminent return.\r\nThen: 'I was this day sennight, which was the last Saturday, upon the\r\nscaffold, where I saw Sir Henry Vane's head severed from his\r\nshoulders.... The Queen perfectly recovered. Cherries are cried here in\r\nthe streets for a penny a pound.'\r\n\r\nSir Edward received scanty reward for all his sacrifices, but he was\r\nreappointed Governor of Dartmouth, and in 1679 his son writes to tell\r\nhim that he had been 'pricked Sheriff for the County of Devon ... by the\r\nKing with all the kindness imaginable,' and an assurance that if Sir\r\nEdward felt the work too much for him, a subordinate should be found and\r\nthe 'chargeable part' made easy. The Earl of Bath wrote by the same\r\npost: 'His Majesty declared in Council that he made choice of you, not\r\nonly because you were the best man of your county, but also a person on\r\nwhom he could by long experience place his greatest confidence.'\r\n\r\nSir Edward died in the winter of 1688, and his son became the fifth Sir\r\nEdward Seymour of Berry Pomeroy in succession.\r\n\r\nThe new Sir Edward was a very distinguished man, who in 1672 had been\r\nunanimously chosen Speaker of the House of Commons. He was the Seymour\r\nwhose influence Lord Macaulay rated so highly, and whose support was\r\nextremely valuable to William of Orange when he arrived in England.\r\nUnfortunately, few of Sir Edward's papers, or papers referring to him,\r\nare now to be found. A long and carefully balanced epitaph in Maiden\r\nBradley Church describes him as\r\n\r\nA MAN OF SUCH ENDOWMENTS\r\nAS ADDED LUSTRE TO HIS WHOLE ANCESTRY,\r\nCOMMANDED REVERENCE FROM HIS CONTEMPORARIES,\r\nAND STANDS THE FINEST PATTERN TO POSTERITY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE SENATE, THE BULWARK OF THE ENGLISH LIBERTY,\r\nIN WHICH HE PRESIDED FOR SEVERAL YEARS,\r\nFOUND HIS ELOQUENCE AN ADVOCATE,\r\nHIS INTEGRITY A GUARDIAN,\r\nHIS VIGOUR A CHAMPION FOR ITS PRIVILEGES.\r\n\r\nAbout five miles north-east of Berry Pomeroy stands Compton Castle, and\r\nthere is a tradition that they were once connected by a subterranean\r\npassage. Compton is a very interesting example of a fortified\r\nmanor-house, built in the early part of the fifteenth century. It stands\r\nlow on the slope of a narrow, winding green valley, and on the west the\r\nhill has been cut back to make room for the walls.\r\n\r\nThe castle faces east, a garden-plot lies in front, and the foundations\r\nof an ancient wall divide it from the lawn beyond. Close to the central\r\ndoor stands the base and broken shaft of a stone cross. The picturesque\r\nwestern front of the castle is gabled and embattled, and a very high\r\narchway is built in the centre of the wall. The colour is difficult to\r\ndescribe, for the castle is very much overgrown with ivy and a faint\r\ngreen lichen has crept over the stones in many parts, but the shades\r\npass from a rich cream colour to a soft grey. A very marked feature is\r\n'the great number of projections carried on machicoulis, through the\r\nopenings of which stones and other missiles could be thrown on the heads\r\nof assailants.' Both the chief doorway and a postern gate to the south\r\nwere defended by portcullises.\r\n\r\nOn the north side an Early Perpendicular window marks the chapel. The\r\ncentral doorway opened into the large and almost square guard-room, and\r\non the north side of this room a pointed doorway leads into the chapel,\r\nwhich keeps some of its special characteristics. At the east end a\r\nsquare space is sunk in the wall above the spot where the altar stood,\r\nand in this space the faint traces of a fresco can still just be seen.\r\nIn the wall that shuts off the guard-room is a cinquefoiled piscina and\r\na four-light window, the stonework of which is like that in the east\r\nwindow, and this window allowed anyone in the guard-room to join in\r\nDivine service. In the west wall is a hagioscope, and from a room next\r\nthe chapel a newel staircase led to the priest's room on the floor\r\nabove. A little window with two cinquefoiled openings in his wall\r\nenabled the priest to look down into the chapel., and the height of the\r\nsill from the floor suggests that it may have served him as a\r\n_prie-dieu_. The moulded base of a stone cross still remains over the\r\nancient belfry, which rises out of a mass of ivy.\r\n\r\nThere are a bewildering number of rooms, many now inaccessible, and the\r\nheight of the walls shows that there were two or three, and in the\r\nnorth-east block four, stories. The banqueting-hall, forty-two feet in\r\nlength and twenty-three in width, has utterly disappeared, and only the\r\ngable-marks of the roof against the buildings on the south side have\r\nenabled Mr Roscoe Gibbs to draw his very careful deductions. In the\r\nkitchen the huge fireplace, stretching the whole width of one wall,\r\nstill keeps its great fire-bars; next the kitchen is the steward's room,\r\nabove which two stories still stand, though the upper one is absolutely\r\nin ruins.\r\n\r\nOutside these rooms is a large open space, now grass-grown, and the\r\nsprays and buds of a cluster-rose tap against the massive walls. Close\r\nby lies a heavy round of granite, slightly hollowed out towards the\r\ncentre, which is shown as one of the stones used for grinding corn. In\r\nan upper room is a hiding-place for treasure--two long, shallow cavities\r\nin the floor, of which there cannot have been the slightest sign when\r\nthe floor was covered with planking. A vaulted passage leads to the\r\nsouth court, and in one corner of this court rises a watch-tower over a\r\nhorrible little dungeon or chamber of torture.\r\n\r\nThe walls throughout the whole building are from two and a half to four\r\nfeet thick, and a thick and solid wall nearly twenty-four feet high\r\nprotects an inner court, where even in January the turf is firm,\r\nspringy, and close. At the farther end, on steps leading into the\r\ngarden, a peacock looks wonderfully appropriate, and some white fantails\r\nstrutting in front of the heavy walls add very much to the picture.\r\nThere is scarcely any sign of the old 'pleasaunce,' except a low and\r\nfairly broad box-hedge, which runs each side of a path in the present\r\ngarden, where a few violets and one or two strawberry-blossoms are\r\ntokens of the softness of the air.\r\n\r\nThe Castle has changed owners many times. 'Stephen' held it of Judhael\r\nof Totnes; then it passed to the De la Poles; Lady Alice de la Pole gave\r\nit to the Comptons, and seven generations later a Compton heiress\r\nbrought it, in the reign of Edward II, to the family of Gilberts, of\r\nwhom Sir Humphrey Gilbert was a descendant. The Gilberts seem to have\r\nlived alternately at Compton and on their older property, Greenway, and\r\nwith one interval the castle belonged to them till nearly the end of the\r\neighteenth century. The only trace of them now to be seen is in the\r\nspandrels of a small cinquefoil-headed opening on the projecting gabled\r\nwing to the south of the central door. Each spandrel is sculptured with\r\ntheir crest, a squirrel holding a hazel branch.\r\n\r\nMr Eden Phillpotts has painted the ruins with a characteristic touch:\r\n\r\n'At gloaming time, when the jackdaws make an end of day, when weary\r\nbirds rustle in the ivy ere they sleep, hearts and eyes, gifted to feel\r\nand see a little above the level prose of working hours, shall yet\r\nconceive these heroes of old moving within their deserted courts. Some\r\nchambers are still whole, and bats sidle through the naked window at the\r\ncall of dusk; some are thrown open to sun and rain and storm; the chapel\r\nstands intact; the scoop for holy water lies still within the thickness\r\nof its wall. But aloft, where rich arras once hid the stone, and silver\r\nsconces held the torch, Nature now sets her hand, brings spleenwort and\r\nharts-tongue, trails the ivy, the speedwell, and the toad-flax....\r\n\r\n'Ivy-mantled, solemn, silent, it stands like a sentient thing, and\r\nbroods with blind eyes upon ages forgotten; when these grey stones still\r\nechoed neigh of horse and bay of hound, rattle of steel, blare of trump,\r\nand bustle of great retinues.'\r\n\r\nThe castle of Okehampton stands about half a mile from the town, and\r\nlooks on one side over fertile hills and valleys, woods, and rich\r\nmeadows, and the gleaming waters of the West Okement, on the other\r\ntowards the bold, changeless outlines of the outer barriers of Dartmoor.\r\nThe Castle was once surrounded by its park. Risdon mentions that\r\noriginally there were 'Castle, market, and park adjoining.... The park,\r\nwhich containeth a large circuit of land, King Henry the eighth, by the\r\npersuasion of Sir Richard Pollard, disparked and alienated the same.'\r\nThe Okement, rippling over a rocky bed--the name _uisg maenic_ means the\r\n'stony water'--hurries past the foot of a knoll on which the castle\r\nrises out of a cloud of green leaves that shelter and half hide the\r\nwalls. Protected by the river and a steeply scarped bank on the south, a\r\nnatural ravine on the north, and a deep notch cut on the western side,\r\nthe mass of slate rock that it stands on was a point of vantage. On the\r\ncrest of the hill the keep stands on a mound, with which two sets of\r\nbuildings were connected by curtain walls. These buildings stretch down\r\nthe slope to the east, the space between the two blocks narrowing\r\ntowards the gateway.\r\n\r\nMr Worth observes that in Devonshire and Cornwall most of the smaller\r\nNorman keeps were round, as at Totnes, Launceston, and Plympton; but the\r\nstronger castles had square keeps. Okehampton, though not a large or\r\nvery strong fortress, was distinguished by its square keep, and\r\n'occupies what may be called a middle position.'\r\n\r\nTradition has always held that Baldwin de Brionis, to whom the Conqueror\r\ngave the manor, built the Castle, and Mr Worth, after a searching\r\nexamination, thinks that, as regards the lower part of the keep walls,\r\nthis may very well be the case; for they are not only Norman, but Norman\r\nof the period in which Baldwin lived. The other buildings are later, but\r\nvary in date, the most modern being the part of the block which contains\r\nthe chapel, and which was probably reconstructed from older buildings\r\ntowards the close of the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\nThere are gaps in the walls of the keep, but the ruins show that there\r\nwere four rooms, two above and two below; some of the windows and a\r\nfireplace in one of the upper rooms are still to be seen. In the\r\nnorthern block of buildings was the great hall--forty-five feet long and\r\ntwenty-five feet wide--lighted by two large windows to the south, and\r\nentered by a boldly moulded granite doorway. A second doorway in one\r\ncorner led to a staircase-turret which led to the roof.\r\n\r\nOn the southern side the buildings are larger and less imperfect. Here\r\nis the chapel, 'evidently,' says Mr Worth, 'a portion of a larger\r\nstructure, which has, perhaps, for the most part disappeared....'\r\n\r\nEast of the chapel are the guard-rooms, in a two-storied block of two\r\nrooms on each floor. A doorway in the north-eastern corner leads into\r\nthe porter's lodge, a small room in the gate-tower with 'a loop window\r\nin the eastern wall commanding the approach. Above this chamber there is\r\none precisely similar in the upper story (the floor, of course, is\r\ngone), and it is noteworthy that this is the only part of the fabric\r\nthat retains its roof, which is supported by three massive stone ribs.'\r\n\r\nThe barony of Okehampton was one of many grants made by the Conqueror to\r\nBaldwin de Brionis, and some generations later it passed by marriage to\r\nthe Courtenays, in which family it remained until the Marquis of Exeter\r\nwas attainted and beheaded in 1538. The Castle was among the possessions\r\nthat Queen Mary restored to the Earl of Devon, and on his death in 1556\r\nhis lands were divided amongst his heirs. Okehampton Castle fell to the\r\nshare of the Mohuns, and in 1628 John Mohun was granted a peerage and\r\ntook the title of Lord Mohun of Okehampton. The last Lord Mohun died in\r\n1712.\r\n\r\nTo the barony of Okehampton belonged Floyer's Hayes, in the parish of St\r\nThomas the Apostle, near Exeter, and it was held on this curious tenure:\r\n'That if the Courtenays, Earls of Devon, came at any time into Exe Isle,\r\nthey [the Floyers] were to attend them, decently apparelled with a clean\r\ntowel on their shoulders, a flagon of wine in one hand and a silver bowl\r\nin the other, and offer to serve them with drink.'\r\n\r\nAbout thirteen miles south-west of Okehampton, Sydenham stands in a\r\nbeautiful valley, overshadowed by woods, in which the shining green of\r\nthe laurels, the darker masses of the rhododendrons' tapering leaves,\r\npatches of russet bracken, and feathery light green moss make a feast of\r\ncolour, even when overhead there is only the bare tracery of twigs and\r\nbranches. The coverts lie on a hill-side that is steep and fairly high,\r\nand at the foot is a rushing stream which is crossed by a bridge exactly\r\nopposite the front of the house.\r\n\r\nThe following notes have been most kindly sent me by Mrs. Tremayne:\r\n\r\n'The Manor of Sidelham, or Sidraham, now called Sydenham, appears to\r\nhave been originally held by four Saxon Thanes, whose names have not\r\nbeen preserved, and to have passed from them into the hands of that\r\npowerful noble, Judhaell de Totnais. On his banishment by William Rufus,\r\nhis property was confiscated, and Sydenham gave its name to a family who\r\nstill possessed it in the reign of Henry III, and was succeeded by a\r\nfamily called Mauris, from whom it passed in marriage to Trevage, and\r\nfrom Trevage to Wise. Part of the house dates from the fourteenth\r\ncentury, and is said to have originally formed a quadrangle or H, but in\r\nthe reign of Elizabeth it was built into the shape of an E, and is a\r\nvery perfect example of Tudor domestic architecture.\r\n\r\n'Sir Edward Wise, in the reign of James I, very much beautified the\r\nhouse, and legend says that he tried to add such height and such an\r\namount of granite to it that Risdon writes, \"The very foundations were\r\nready to reel under the burthen.\" The house lies in a lovely wooded\r\nvalley on the banks of the River Lyd, and it has four separate\r\nentrances, each opening on to a court or garden. Access to the\r\nfront-entrance--commonly called the Green Court--is through a fine iron\r\ngateway, and above the central door are the Wise arms. Most of the\r\nwindows have eight rounded granite mullions and small leaded panes of\r\nglass, and in some the original glass still remains. Two windows in the\r\nfront are of Charles I.'s date, and have quaint fan-shaped lights. Over\r\nthe large granite open fireplace in the front-hall is the date 1656,\r\nwhen the house underwent repair after damage, caused, it is said, in the\r\nCivil Wars. There is a story repeated in many histories of Devon, and\r\ntold by Lysons amongst others, that Sydenham was taken in 1644 by\r\nColonel Holborne; but I have every reason to believe that the Sydenham\r\ngarrisoned and taken was Combe Sydenham, in the parish of Stogumber,\r\nnear Taunton, but the fact that within the last forty years a sword and\r\nother weapons, also seventeenth-century horseshoes, have been found may\r\nbe taken as a proof that fighting of some sort did take place.\r\n\r\n'In making alterations in the kitchen chimney some twenty years ago, a\r\nlittle hiding-place, or priest's room, was found opening out of it, and\r\nin it was an oak table and the remains of a chair; and since then large\r\nand small unsuspected rooms have been discovered, and it has been said\r\nthat in the largest a troop could lie hidden--as indeed it could with\r\nease. Quite recently a secret passage leading from the house towards the\r\nriver has been found, bearing out the legend always handed down, \"that\r\nthe Lady Wise of the day escaped with a large party by a secret passage\r\nnear the river, and got into the woods undetected by the soldiers who\r\nwere round the house.\" It is very probable that the secret rooms\r\nmentioned and the passage communicated.\r\n\r\n'There is fine oak panelling in most of the rooms, and in the\r\ndining-room the panelling is inlaid in a delicate design with an\r\nivory-like substance. Secret passages exist to this day in the walls,\r\nwhich are of immense thickness, in some places being seven feet in\r\ndepth. There are three oak staircases, the main one being finely carved\r\nwith figures standing at the angles, and another having very fine\r\nnewels.\r\n\r\n'In what goes by the name of the King's Room there is an ancient bed,\r\nwith fine old red silk curtains and the Prince of Wales's plumes over\r\nit, in which Charles I and Charles II are reported to have slept. It is\r\nquite likely that Charles II, when Prince of Wales, did come here, as he\r\nis known to have been many weeks in the neighbourhood.'\r\n\r\nThe garden is delightful, and no change in it has been made for very\r\nmany years. A wide lawn slopes away from the house, and a very small\r\nstraight rivulet runs through it just a foot or two from the path. At\r\nthe foot of the slope is a tiny lake, which, though very narrow, divides\r\nthe lawn from end to end, and beyond the water the ground rises\r\ngradually. Clipped bushes and a large flower-border mark the farther\r\nedge of the lawn.\r\n\r\nThe Tremaynes were originally a Cornish family, but they came to\r\nDevonshire early in the fourteenth century. For at this time Isabella\r\nTrenchard of Collocombe married Thomas Tremayne, and after his death Sir\r\nJohn Damarel, 'and so much gain'd the affection of her second husband\r\nthat he gave her and her heirs by Tremain (having none of his own)' some\r\nof his estates.\r\n\r\nThomas Tremayne and Philippa his wife lived during the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and had sixteen children, several of whom distinguished\r\nthemselves. Andrew and Nicholas were twins, and so amazingly alike 'in\r\nall their lineaments, so equal in stature, so colour'd in hair, and of\r\nsuch resemblance in face and gesture,' that they were only recognized,\r\n'even by their near relations,' 'by wearing some several coloured riband\r\nor the like ... yet somewhat more strange was that their minds and\r\naffections were as one: for what the one loved the other desired: ...\r\nyea, such a confederation of inbred power and of sympathy was in their\r\nnatures, that if Nicholas were sick or grieved, Andrew felt the like\r\npain, though far distant and remote in their persons.'\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Peter Carew fled the country, suspected of plotting against\r\nQueen Mary, Andrew Tremayne embarked with him at Weymouth, and later\r\nNicholas joined his twin in France, and they threw in their lot with a\r\ntroop of adventurers who harassed the Channel. Froude has said: 'The\r\nsons of honourable houses ... dashed out upon the waters to revenge the\r\nSmithfield massacres. They found help where it could least have been\r\nlooked for: Henry II of France hated heresy, but he hated Spain worse.\r\nSooner than see England absorbed in the Spanish monarchy, he forgot his\r\nbigotry in his politics. He furnished these young mutineers with ships\r\nand money and letters of marque. The Huguenots were their natural\r\nfriends; with Rochelle for an arsenal, they held the mouth of the\r\nChannel, and harassed the communications between Cadiz and Antwerp.'\r\n\r\nOccasionally the twins met with ill-luck, and an entry in the Acts of\r\nthe Privy Council records that: 'To be committed to several prisons, to\r\nbe kept secret, without having conference with any ... Andrew Tremayne\r\nto the Marshalsey and Nicholas Tremayne to the Gate House, suspected of\r\npiracy.' Afterwards they went back to their life of risks and chances on\r\nthe high seas.\r\n\r\nBut when Elizabeth came to the throne a different view was taken of\r\nthese rovers. 'Privateering suited Elizabeth's convenience,' says\r\nFroude. 'Time was wanted to restore the Navy. The privateers were a\r\nresource in the interval ... they were really the armed force of the\r\ncountry.' So (in 1559) instructions were sent to the English Ambassador\r\nin Paris that certain gentlemen, among whom were the Tremaynes, 'as\r\nshall serve their country, the Ambassador shall himself comfort them to\r\nreturn home. Circumspection must be used.' The postscript is\r\ncharacteristically cautious.\r\n\r\nThe Queen valued Nicholas as a trustworthy messenger, where a matter\r\nneeded discreet handling, and the bearer of it was likely to be in\r\ndanger. In 1559-60 the Bishop of Aquila wrote to the King of Spain: 'The\r\nQueen has just sent to France an Englishman called Tremaine, a great\r\nheretic, who is to disembark in Brittany. I understand that he goes\r\nbackwards and forwards with messages to the heretics in that country.'\r\nOn one journey he was arrested when carrying letters in cipher, and\r\nThrockmorton, the English Ambassador in Paris, wrote to the Due de\r\nGuise, asking for his release. Nicholas was a special favourite of the\r\nQueen, but as he loved a camp better than a court, she gave him leave\r\n'to enter into the service of the King of Navarre, by which means he\r\nwill be better able to serve her.' The King of Navarre, however, did not\r\ngreatly appreciate Tremayne, and a short time afterwards Throckmorton\r\nwrites: 'The bearer, Mr Tremayne, came out of England with intent to see\r\nthe wars in Almain, or elsewhere, thereby to be better able to serve the\r\nQueen. He has been here a good while to hearken which way the flame will\r\nrise to his purpose; but now, finding all the Princes in Christendom\r\ninclined to sit still, returns home. Desires Cecil to do something for\r\nhim to help him to live, as it will be right well bestowed. The Queen\r\nwill have a good servant in him, and Cecil an honest gentleman at his\r\ncommand.'\r\n\r\nAndrew had entered the army, and in Scotland reaped fame from the\r\nbrilliant cavalry charge which drove the French back into Leith. Lord\r\nGrey wrote in 1560-61 that he had chosen Captain Tremayne to escort Lord\r\nJames, 'because he is a gentleman of good behaviour, courtesy, and well\r\ntrained, and also that he stands in the favour of the Lords of Scotland\r\nby reason of his valiant service at Leith.'\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1562-63 the Queen began openly to help the Huguenots at\r\nHavre, and Nicholas Tremayne was sent there at the head of 'fifty\r\nhorsemen pistolliers.' In the following May Captain Tremayne's band and\r\nsome others, in a skirmish, 'repulsed the Rheingrave's whole force,\r\nslain and taken near 400, with one ensign and seven drums. Not more than\r\ntwenty of their own were killed and wounded, none to his knowledge\r\ntaken.' Four days later Tremayne's troops, over-confident, risked too\r\nmuch, and their Captain was shot, to the great grief of his\r\nfellow-officers. Warwick wrote to Cecil: 'Whereas you write that you are\r\nmore sorry for the death of Tremain than you could be glad of the death\r\nof a 100 Allmaynes, I assure you that there is never a man but is of the\r\nsame opinion.' The Queen was much grieved by the loss. 'She had\r\nresented,' says Froude, 'the expulsion of the French inhabitants of\r\nHavre ... she was more deeply affected with the death of Tremayne; and\r\nWarwick was obliged to tell her that war was a rough game; she must not\r\ndiscourage her troops by finding fault with measures indispensable to\r\nsuccess; for Tremayne, he said, \"men came there to venture their lives\r\nfor her Majesty and their country, and must stand to that which God had\r\nappointed either to live or die.\"'\r\n\r\nRisdon concludes his account of the twins by saying that they died\r\ntogether; but this is not altogether accurate, for, about a week after\r\nthe death of Nicholas, Andrew with three hundred soldiers set sail from\r\nBerwick for Havre. It is, however, quite true that they died in the same\r\nplace, and the interval between their deaths was very short, for about\r\nseven weeks after his twin was killed Andrew Tremayne succumbed to the\r\nplague.\r\n\r\nEdward Tremayne, another brother, followed the fortunes of the Marquis\r\nof Exeter, and was 'a great sufferer for his inviolable fidelity to his\r\nnoble master.' So firm was his devotion that even torture failed to\r\nextort from him a confession that the Marquis and 'the Lady Elizabeth'\r\nhad been involved in Wyatt's conspiracy. His 'invincible resolution'\r\nasserted their innocence, even on the rack, and Queen Elizabeth later\r\nrecognized this splendid loyalty by making him 'one of the clerks of Her\r\nMajesty's most honourable privy-council.'\r\n\r\nCecil had a high opinion of Tremayne, and in 1569 showed his faith in\r\nTremayne's judgment by sending him to Ireland, to sift the terrible but\r\nconflicting stories of its miseries and rebellions, and 'to let him\r\nknow quietly the real condition of the country.' Tremayne, to begin\r\nwith, wrote hopefully of remedies for all that was wrong, but after a\r\nyear's study and experience realized that the trouble lay deeper than he\r\nhad at first understood. Nevertheless, some notes on the state of\r\nIreland by Edward Tremayne are endorsed by Lord Burghley 'A good\r\nadvice.' The Queen showed her confidence by entrusting to him (in 1580)\r\na very delicate task. The treasure that Drake brought home in the\r\n_Pelican_ had to be registered; the examination must be made before some\r\npublic officer, but the Queen feared that it might be necessary to make\r\nrestitution to Spain, and, not objecting to a little crooked dealing,\r\nwas very anxious that the total amount of the booty should never be made\r\nknown. In obedience to the instructions he received from her, Tremayne\r\nwrites to Walsingham: 'I have at no time entered into the account, to\r\nknow more of the very value of the treasure than he made me acquainted\r\nwith. And to say the truth, I persuaded him to impart to me no more than\r\nneed, for so I saw him commanded in her Majesty's behalf, that he should\r\nreveal the certainly to no man living.' Here follows a fine tribute to\r\nDrake's unselfishness: 'And withal, I must say, as I find by apparent\r\ndemonstration, he is so inclined to advance the value to be delivered to\r\nher Majesty and seeking in general to recompense all men that have been\r\nin this case dealers with him, as I dare take an oath with him, he will\r\nrather diminish his own portion than leave any of them unsatisfied.'\r\n\r\nEdmund Tremayne, of a later generation, faithfully served his King in\r\nthe troubled times of the Civil Wars, 'and was several hundred pounds\r\ndeep in their books, at Haberdashers' Hall, for his loyalty. He is also\r\nstated to have repaid a considerable portion of the money borrowed for\r\nthe necessities of the Queen during her sojourn at Exeter, at the time\r\nof the birth of the Princess Henrietta. Later he was imprisoned and his\r\ngoods were sequestrated.'\r\n\r\nA very treasured possession in the family is the 'tongue token,'\r\nbelieved to have originally belonged to this Edmund Tremayne. These\r\ntokens, small enough to put under the tongue in case of need, were given\r\nto the bearers of messages from those of high rank or importance, as a\r\nproof of the genuineness of the bearer, where there was too much danger\r\nto risk a written word. This token is a tiny oval of gold, with the head\r\nof King Charles on one side and his initials on the other. Edmund\r\nTremayne is supposed to have received this token when he carried the\r\nnews of the Princess's birth from Exeter to the King at Oxford.\r\n\r\nMr Tremayne's grandson, Edmund, married Arabella, the daughter and\r\nheiress of Sir Edward Wise, who brought Sydenham to the Tremaynes.\r\nVarious traces of the Wises remain, among them a portrait of a\r\ngolden-haired Lady Wise. She is painted wearing a white satin dress, an\r\nimmense Vandyck collar, and many ornaments. Among her possessions was a\r\nmagnificent set of 'horse furniture,' made, it is supposed, for some\r\nstate occasion when she rode with her husband in the year (1633) that he\r\nwas High Sheriff. It is of very fine and rich crimson velvet, arranged\r\nto fit over the pommels of the saddle and hang down on either side. The\r\nfurniture includes an imposing red velvet stirrup, and both this and the\r\nsaddle-cloth are elaborately and beautifully worked with silver\r\nembroidery, and hung with silver tassels to match; and a piece of velvet\r\nthat lay over the crupper is thickly strewn with delicate little silver\r\ncockle-shells.\r\n\r\nAbout fourteen miles north-east of Exeter, in the valley of the Culm,\r\nstands Bradfield; an avenue of cedars leads up to the house, which is an\r\nElizabethan one in a very perfect condition. The banqueting-hall is\r\npanelled throughout, and its fine carved roof is supported by\r\nelaborately carved and pierced hammer-beams. High at one end is the\r\nminstrels' gallery, and at the other is a latticed window, which opened\r\non to a corridor, and is said to have been used by the lady of the\r\nhouse, who could see from it anything that might be happening in the\r\nhall. A high arch on one side of the hall divides a small panelled room,\r\nwhere the guests gathered before dinner. The arch is of white stone, and\r\nlittle blocks, each bearing a shield or flower, are set at intervals on\r\nthe mouldings.\r\n\r\nThe music-room is panelled, and above the panels are hangings of\r\nSpanish leather covered with graceful designs. The fireplace and very\r\ninteresting 'porch' projecting into the room look like late Italian\r\nRenaissance work, though, from the dresses of the carved figures on\r\nthem, they are supposed to have been actually made in England. The porch\r\nis richly carved and painted, and slender strips of very light wood are\r\ninlaid amongst a mass of ornamental details. The figures seem more than\r\na little incongruous to each other. On one panel are Adam and Eve with\r\nthe Tree of Knowledge between them, and above appear ladies and\r\ngentlemen of the court of Queen Elizabeth--little coloured figures,\r\nstanding well out from the backs of their niches.\r\n\r\nThe fireplace is very elaborately carved and painted, and here, too, are\r\nfigures in curious juxtaposition surrounded by very rich decorations.\r\nAmongst others may be seen a farmer and his wife, a cook, with a large\r\ngoose that she is about to kill, and a dairymaid, with a miniature cow\r\nin her arms. High above these are the sons and daughters of Jesse in\r\nsplendid robes and crowns.\r\n\r\nBradfield, in ancient days Bradefelle, was once held by a family of that\r\nname. The deed that carried it to the Walronds is not dated, but a\r\nmarginal note says that 'Fulke Paynel' was dead in 1 Henry III. The deed\r\nruns as follows:\r\n\r\nFulke Paynel grants to Richard Walerond of Exeter all his land of\r\nBradfield in his Manor of Offeculme. Richard Walerond is to make two\r\nsuits yearly, one at 'La Hockeday,'[10] and one at Michaelmas\r\namercement, to consist of one sextary of wine of the value of sixpence\r\nand not more. Grant of common pasture throughout the manor, except in\r\nfields and meadows. One pound of pepper to be paid at Michaelmas\r\nannually. In recognition of this grant Richard Walerond 'pays to Fulke\r\nPaynel five marks of silver, and gives to Hande his wife' one golden\r\nring, and to William his heir one golden brooch.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: 'La Hockeday' is commonly, but incorrectly, supposed to\r\ncommemorate the freedom of the English by the massacre of the Danes on\r\nthe Feast of St. Brice, 1002. 'Hoke-tide' began on the Monday after the\r\nsecond Sunday after Easter.]\r\n\r\nWitnesses: Simon son of Roger, Hamelin de Boulay, William de Lomene,\r\nWalter de Tiddecomba, Simon de Baunton and Robert his brother, Peter\r\nComyn, Radulphus de Doddescomba, Walter de Soffewill, 'and many others.'\r\n\r\nAmong the Walrond papers is an agreement dated Michaelmas, 1261,\r\nregarding a farm 'let for nineteen years, in consideration of four marks\r\npaid and one mark a year for six years and rent of six shillings a year\r\n... and two capons at Michaelmas and one bushel of winter wheat at\r\nChristmas in each year, from one ferling of land in Cumb.'\r\n\r\nI believe that the views held by Sir Henry Walrond of the arrival of\r\nWilliam of Orange are not clearly recorded, but whatever they were, a\r\nnote written by General Ginkel, during the march from Tor Bay to\r\nWhitehall, was, considering the position of things, decidedly\r\nperemptory:\r\n\r\n     'Sir van Ginkel, Lt.-General of the Cavalry of the United\r\n     Netherlands, in the service of his Highness, the Prince of Orange,\r\n     etc.\r\n\r\n     'We have taken up our quarters in the house of Sir Hendrie Waldron,\r\n     which quarters we desire shall be kept open as long as the troops\r\n     of His Highness shall remain in this town or neighbourhood; we have\r\n     also left in the care of the aforesaid Sr Hendries Waldron two\r\n     black horses, and likewise the gray mare, which he shall keep for\r\n     us.\r\n\r\n     'Given at Columpton the 7/17 November, 1688.\r\n\r\n     'BAR DE REAL DE GINKEL.'\r\n\r\nA charming echo from the past sounds in a very different epistle--a\r\nlove-letter from Sir William Walrond to a Mistress Courtenay. The letter\r\nis written on a sheet of paper covered with gold-leaf and bordered with\r\nelaborate designs. The case belonging to it is embroidered in fine\r\ncrewel-work in (more or less) natural colours, representing figures,\r\nscenery, and a house in the background, and it suggests the needles of\r\nLittle Gidding.\r\n\r\n     'HONOURED LADY,\r\n\r\n     'The happiness I late enjoy'd by the fruition of your sweete\r\n     society gives an incentive to mee to let you knowe how deep you are\r\n     percullest[11] in my brest, though their injurious feare [youth's\r\n     usual concomitant] obscured those larger narratives of my most\r\n     intensive love and really devoted service ... 'twas my present fate\r\n     then to be lesse expressive when I most admir'de these eminent\r\n     perfections which both art & nature have adorn'd you with and as\r\n     being doubtful of obtaining what I heartily desired remained your\r\n     captive but in confidence of your candid disposition am now your\r\n     humble petitioner to bee so far happified as to be deemed your\r\n     honouring servant. Let then, I beseech you (worthy, lady) this poor\r\n     and unpolished character of my due respects and firm affections\r\n     achieve the happiness of kissing your fairest hands and you shall\r\n     thereby engage at present and in future\r\n\r\n    'Your most honouring\r\n\r\n    'friende and servant,\r\n\r\n    'WILL WALROND.\r\n\r\n    '_Anderdon this 27th of October, 1659._'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Portcullised.]\r\n\r\nPynes stands in the Exe Valley, just within three miles of Exeter\r\nCathedral. It is of red brick with white dressings, and has many high\r\nnarrow windows. A view has been put forward that the politics of country\r\ngentlemen in the early part of the eighteenth century may always be\r\ntraced by their trees; those who were in favour of William III set\r\nlime-avenues, while Jacobites planted Scotch firs. There is a tradition\r\nin the family that, while the Northcotes were for the Prince of Orange,\r\nthe Staffords were for King James, but it seems quite as likely that\r\npolitical significance was not always the chief point in planting trees.\r\nIn any case, there are many Scotch firs, and a lime-avenue (peculiarly\r\nin keeping with the style of the house) is shown by prints to have led\r\nfar over the hill to Upton Pyne, but is now, alas! represented only by\r\none or two aged survivors.\r\n\r\nThe manor belonged to the family of Pyne in the reign of Henry I, and\r\nafter many years was brought by an heiress to the Larders. From this\r\nfamily, after another interval, it passed by marriage to the\r\nCoplestones, of whom it was bought by Hugh Stafford.\r\n\r\nThe Staffords, or, as the name originally was, Stowfords, migrated from\r\nStowford in Dolton near Torrington, soon after the Restoration. Hugh\r\nStafford, born in 1674, was very keenly interested in the subject of\r\napple-growing and cider. He wrote a 'Dissertation' on the subject, and\r\nespecially on a certain apple called the Royal Wilding, from which it\r\nhad just been discovered (about 1710) a very superior kind of cider\r\ncould be produced. Unfortunately, Lord Bute's cider-tax so greatly\r\ndiscouraged the manufacture that after it had been imposed farmers only\r\nmade enough for their own use and their labourers', and were not very\r\ncritical as to the quality. In consequence, the choicest kinds of fruit\r\nwere neglected, and both the Royal Wilding and the White Sour of the\r\nSouth Hams, another much-prized apple, are no longer to be found.\r\n\r\nThe daughter and heiress of Mr Stafford married her neighbour, Sir Henry\r\nNorthcote. The Northcotes have been settled in Devonshire since the\r\nreign of Henry I, when Galfridus de Northcote held the lands of\r\nNorthcote at East Down, near Barnstaple, and in the middle of the\r\nsixteenth century Walter Northcote was living at Uton, in the parish of\r\nCrediton. In this neighbourhood his descendants remained until Sir\r\nHenry's marriage, when they came to Pynes.\r\n\r\nJohn Northcote was one of the Devonshire justices who attended Quarter\r\nSessions during the later part of the reign of Elizabeth, and he lived\r\ntill within ten years of the outbreak of Civil War. From his epitaph, it\r\nappears that he was tried by the Star Chamber; the verse has been\r\ntranslated as follows:\r\n\r\n    'To him the Queen's Commission in his youth\r\n    Trusted the scales of Justice and of Truth.\r\n    Fair was the balance held, and pure his fame,\r\n    Though by Star Chamber tried, as gold by flame.'\r\n\r\nNothing is known of the trial, not even the charge, but it is pretty\r\ncertain that, in common with several other justices at that time, he\r\nhad showed 'a want of \"forwardness\"' in collecting ship-money.\r\n\r\nAnother justice, Walter Yonge, notes in his diary that in 1627 letters\r\nwere sent to the justices of Devon, 'to the Mayors of port-towns,\r\nExeter, Dartmouth, Totnes, Plymouth, and Barnstaple, bidding the towns\r\nprovide ships, and the country, men and victuals.' Later, letters were\r\nsent demanding that a large sum should be raised 'to set a fleet at sea\r\n... we having but six or seven days to raise the money, and to return it\r\nto London; but _our county refused to meddle therein_.' John Northcote\r\nwas Sheriff just at this time, and was most probably held responsible\r\nfor the intractability of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nSir John Northcote, his son, was born in 1599, and became a Member of\r\nParliament, he and Sir Edmund Fowel representing Ashburton in the Long\r\nParliament. During his first few weeks in the House of Commons, Sir John\r\ntook notes of the proceedings, and the small brown volume in which they\r\nare written still exists. The notes have been transcribed by Mr A. H. A.\r\nHamilton, and are very interesting, for they record threatenings of the\r\ngreat storm so soon to burst over England. The pages open with\r\n'Proceedings against the Earl of Strafford. Mr Pimm's [Pym]\r\nReport'--which report prefaces terrible accusations with a personal\r\ntouch: 'Long known the person charged by acts of friendship.'\r\n\r\nMany letters, reports, and commissions, refer to Jesuits and priests,\r\nand often the Queen's name appears intervening on their behalf; laws\r\nagainst them were more and more relaxed, 'signifying his Majesty's\r\npleasure at instance of her Majesty,' till the Commons became uneasy,\r\nand a 'petition' was framed to the King, to remind him of his\r\n'protestation' at the opening of his reign, that the Queen 'should not\r\nintermeddle with matters of religion.'\r\n\r\nThe long and stubborn opposition to the exaction of ship-money, 'Voted\r\nillegal and entered _nullo contradicente_,' is given. The Judges who had\r\ndeclared the tax to be legal were supposed to have been tampered with by\r\nStrafford, and Mr Hyde (afterwards Lord Clarendon) suggested that they\r\nshould be interviewed as to what had passed. The following is a bit of\r\nthe debate as it was taken down; as Sir John did not write shorthand, he\r\nwas naturally able to give only the gist of each speech:\r\n\r\n'MR HIDE. That some of the house be sent to know what solicitations\r\n[_had been made_].\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'SIR FRANC. SEYMOUR. That proof be first made.\r\n\r\n'MR PELHAM. That it will amount to high treason and to prepare present\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n'SIR JO. WRAY. The posy of his grandfather, Just and True. Sir Ed. Cook\r\n[said] whoever shall go about to overthrow Common Law, the Common Law\r\nwill overthrow him. His motion, _Currat Lex_.\r\n\r\n'SERGEANT EVERS. To have first the votes of the Lords.\r\n\r\n'SIR P. STAPYLTON. That Mr Peard be sent to Judge Jones.\r\n\r\n'SIR JO. STRANGWAYES. That Justice Crook be sent to.\r\n\r\n'LORD FAWKLAND. That they be sent to all at once.\r\n\r\n'SIR NEVILL POOLE. That Lord Keeper be forth coming.\r\n\r\n'MR CONTROLLER. That respect be had to Judges. That none be urged to be\r\naccuser, but concluded that all be sent to.\r\n\r\n'SIR JO. CULPEPER. Of twelve one was a Judas. To send to all the Judges\r\nthat gave the Judgment, and to send immediately.'\r\n\r\nAnother debate shows the King and Parliament for the moment on unusually\r\ngood terms. Sir Benjamin Rudyard said: 'God blest his Majesty with\r\nhopeful and fruitful progeny. To put in mind to provide for them. The\r\nfirst prince born amongst us this 100 years. Queen's good affection to\r\nParliament. Concern her Majesty to uphold the glory and government of\r\nthis kingdom.'\r\n\r\nWhen the crisis came, most of the Devonshire members seem to have\r\nsupported the Parliament, guided, no doubt, to some extent by the\r\nwonderful influence of 'King' Pym. Pym sat for Tavistock; 'his colleague\r\nwas a son of the House of Russell. William Strode sat for Buralston, and\r\nhis elder brother for Plympton.' Northcote was slightly connected with\r\nthe Strodes, and when war broke out he followed the Earl of Bedford. In\r\nSeptember, 1642, Sir Hugh Pollard wrote to the Earl of Bath: 'The Earl\r\nof Bedford is now at Taunton, in want of men and money; he hath sent to\r\nhis friends Chudleigh, Bampfield, and Northcote, for a supply of both,\r\nwhose oratory cannot get one trained man to move, nor above eight\r\nvolunteers.'\r\n\r\nThe letter receives a curious comment from the succeeding ones. At that\r\nvery time the Earl of Bedford was issuing orders for the arrest of Sir\r\nHugh Pollard, and four days afterwards Sir George Chudleigh and Sir John\r\nNorthcote wrote to Major Carey, expressing their approval of Captain\r\nDewett's conduct in capturing the Earl of Bath. Sir John was now at the\r\nhead of a regiment of twelve hundred men, and seems to have held the\r\ncommand during the first two years of the Civil War. He took an active\r\npart in the defence of Plymouth, and in 1643 at Modbury a victory was\r\nwon by the forces under Lieutenant-General Ruthen, Sir J. Bampfield, and\r\nSir John Northcote, over Lord Hopton's troops. Many of the\r\nParliamentarian gentlemen were anxious for peace, and just after this\r\nskirmish tried to arrange an 'association' or neutrality between Devon\r\nand Cornwall; but the idea was quashed by Commissioners from London. A\r\nfew months later Clarendon mentions that Sir John was sent by the Earl\r\nof Bedford, the Parliamentary General of Horse, to negotiate a treaty\r\nwith the Marquis of Hertford.\r\n\r\nSir John was elected to the Parliament of 1656, and showed himself a\r\nconstant lover of liberty. He inveighed against the powers granted to\r\nCromwell's House of Peers. 'It was minded you ... that no law was\r\nrightly made but by King, Lords, and Commons. I am sure this law was not\r\nmade so.' He lays stress on the point that the old House of Lords\r\nventured all that they had, and protests against their being superseded\r\nby new-comers. 'That they should be excluded and these advanced is not\r\njust nor reasonable.' A little later he spoke again on the same subject:\r\n'We thought in the long Parliament we might restrain the inordinate\r\npower of the Chief Magistrate. That was the ground of our quarrel in the\r\nlate war; but ... it seems we cannot bound these Lords' exorbitant\r\npowers.... I did fight against an exorbitant power in the King's hands,\r\nand _I will fight against it again to the last drop of blood_, if his\r\nHighness command me, whenever such power shall be set up, if it be\r\nto-morrow, and in whatever hands it be.'\r\n\r\nJohn Northcote was one of the two Knights of the Shire for Devon in the\r\nConvention Parliament, the other being the Lord General Monk. The\r\nRestoration was gladly welcomed by him, but he 'spoke repeatedly in\r\nfavour of pardon and amnesty, and when necessity arose, he seems to have\r\nconfronted the triumphant Cavaliers in debate as boldly as he had met\r\nthem, or their fathers, in the field.' This was the last Parliament that\r\nSir John sat in. A little later he turned to the West, and spent most of\r\nthe days that were left him in Devon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nList of Authorities Consulted\r\n\r\n\r\nBARING-GOULD (S.): A Book of Dartmoor.\r\n\r\nBARING-GOULD (S.): A Book of the West.\r\n\r\nBARING-GOULD (S.): Devonshire Characters and Strange Events.\r\n\r\nBLOUNT (T.): Tenures of Lands.\r\n\r\nBLUNDELL'S Worthies, edited by M.
