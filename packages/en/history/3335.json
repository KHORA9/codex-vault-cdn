Practical efficiency is common, and lofty idealism not uncommon;\r\nit is the combination which is necessary, and the combination is rare.\r\nLove of peace is common among weak, short-sighted, timid, and lazy\r\npersons; and on the other hand courage is found among many men of evil\r\ntemper and bad character. Neither quality shall by itself avail. Justice\r\namong the nations of mankind, and the uplifting of humanity, can be\r\nbrought about only by those strong and daring men who with wisdom love\r\npeace, but who love righteousness more than peace. Facing the immense\r\ncomplexity of modern social and industrial conditions, there is need to\r\nuse freely and unhesitatingly the collective power of all of us; and\r\nyet no exercise of collective power will ever avail if the average\r\nindividual does not keep his or her sense of personal duty, initiative,\r\nand responsibility. There is need to develop all the virtues that have\r\nthe state for their sphere of action; but these virtues are as dust in a\r\nwindy street unless back of them lie the strong and tender virtues of\r\na family life based on the love of the one man for the one woman and on\r\ntheir joyous and fearless acceptance of their common obligation to the\r\nchildren that are theirs. There must be the keenest sense of duty, and\r\nwith it must go the joy of living; there must be shame at the thought of\r\nshirking the hard work of the world, and at the same time delight in\r\nthe many-sided beauty of life. With soul of flame and temper of steel we\r\nmust act as our coolest judgment bids us. We must exercise the largest\r\ncharity towards the wrong-doer that is compatible with relentless war\r\nagainst the wrong-doing. We must be just to others, generous to others,\r\nand yet we must realize that it is a shameful and a wicked thing not to\r\nwithstand oppression with high heart and ready hand. With gentleness and\r\ntenderness there must go dauntless bravery and grim acceptance of labor\r\nand hardship and peril. All for each, and each for all, is a good motto;\r\nbut only on condition that each works with might and main to so maintain\r\nhimself as not to be a burden to others.\r\n\r\nWe of the great modern democracies must strive unceasingly to make our\r\nseveral countries lands in which a poor man who works hard can\r\nlive comfortably and honestly, and in which a rich man cannot live\r\ndishonestly nor in slothful avoidance of duty; and yet we must judge\r\nrich man and poor man alike by a standard which rests on conduct and not\r\non caste, and we must frown with the same stern severity on the mean and\r\nvicious envy which hates and would plunder a man because he is well off\r\nand on the brutal and selfish arrogance which looks down on and exploits\r\nthe man with whom life has gone hard.\r\n\r\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\nSAGAMORE HILL, October 1, 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nBOYHOOD AND YOUTH\r\n\r\nMy grandfather on my father's side was of almost purely Dutch blood.\r\nWhen he was young he still spoke some Dutch, and Dutch was last used\r\nin the services of the Dutch Reformed Church in New York while he was a\r\nsmall boy.\r\n\r\nAbout 1644 his ancestor Klaes Martensen van Roosevelt came to New\r\nAmsterdam as a \"settler\"--the euphemistic name for an immigrant who\r\ncame over in the steerage of a sailing ship in the seventeenth century\r\ninstead of the steerage of a steamer in the nineteenth century. From\r\nthat time for the next seven generations from father to son every one of\r\nus was born on Manhattan Island.\r\n\r\nMy father's paternal ancestors were of Holland stock; except that there\r\nwas one named Waldron, a wheelwright, who was one of the Pilgrims who\r\nremained in Holland when the others came over to found Massachusetts,\r\nand who then accompanied the Dutch adventurers to New Amsterdam.\r\nMy father's mother was a Pennsylvanian. Her forebears had come to\r\nPennsylvania with William Penn, some in the same ship with him; they\r\nwere of the usual type of the immigration of that particular place and\r\ntime. They included Welsh and English Quakers, an Irishman,--with a\r\nCeltic name, and apparently not a Quaker,--and peace-loving Germans,\r\nwho were among the founders of Germantown, having been driven from their\r\nRhineland homes when the armies of Louis the Fourteenth ravaged\r\nthe Palatinate; and, in addition, representatives of a by-no-means\r\naltogether peaceful people, the Scotch Irish, who came to Pennsylvania\r\na little later, early in the eighteenth century. My grandmother was a\r\nwoman of singular sweetness and strength, the keystone of the arch in\r\nher relations with her husband and sons. Although she was not herself\r\nDutch, it was she who taught me the only Dutch I ever knew, a baby\r\nsong of which the first line ran, \"Trippe troppa tronjes.\" I always\r\nremembered this, and when I was in East Africa it proved a bond of union\r\nbetween me and the Boer settlers, not a few of whom knew it, although at\r\nfirst they always had difficulty in understanding my pronunciation--at\r\nwhich I do not wonder. It was interesting to meet these men whose\r\nancestors had gone to the Cape about the time that mine went to America\r\ntwo centuries and a half previously, and to find that the descendants\r\nof the two streams of emigrants still crooned to their children some at\r\nleast of the same nursery songs.\r\n\r\nOf my great-grandfather Roosevelt and his family life a century and over\r\nago I know little beyond what is implied in some of his books that have\r\ncome down to me--the Letters of Junius, a biography of John Paul Jones,\r\nChief Justice Marshall's \"Life of Washington.\" They seem to indicate\r\nthat his library was less interesting than that of my wife's\r\ngreat-grandfather at the same time, which certainly included such\r\nvolumes as the original _Edinburgh Review_, for we have them now on our\r\nown book-shelves. Of my grandfather Roosevelt my most vivid childish\r\nreminiscence is not something I saw, but a tale that was told me\r\nconcerning him. In _his_ boyhood Sunday was as dismal a day for small\r\nCalvinistic children of Dutch descent as if they had been of Puritan or\r\nScotch Covenanting or French Huguenot descent--and I speak as one proud\r\nof his Holland, Huguenot, and Covenanting ancestors, and proud that the\r\nblood of that stark Puritan divine Jonathan Edwards flows in the veins\r\nof his children. One summer afternoon, after listening to an unusually\r\nlong Dutch Reformed sermon for the second time that day, my grandfather,\r\na small boy, running home before the congregation had dispersed, ran\r\ninto a party of pigs, which then wandered free in New York's streets. He\r\npromptly mounted a big boar, which no less promptly bolted and carried\r\nhim at full speed through the midst of the outraged congregation.\r\n\r\nBy the way, one of the Roosevelt documents which came down to me\r\nillustrates the change that has come over certain aspects of public life\r\nsince the time which pessimists term \"the earlier and better days of\r\nthe Republic.\" Old Isaac Roosevelt was a member of an Auditing Committee\r\nwhich shortly after the close of the Revolution approved the following\r\nbill:\r\n\r\n     The State of New York, to John Cape    Dr.\r\n\r\n     To a Dinner Given by His Excellency the Governor\r\n     and Council to their Excellencies the Minnister of\r\n     France and General Washington & Co.\r\n\r\n     1783\r\n     December\r\n     To 120 dinners at                 48: 0:0\r\n     To 135 Bottles Madira             54: 0:0\r\n     \"   36 ditto Port                 10:16:0\r\n     \"   60 ditto English Beer          9: 0:0\r\n     \"   30 Bouls Punch                 9: 0:0\r\n     \"    8 dinners for Musick          1:12:0\r\n     \"   10 ditto for Sarvts            2: 0:0\r\n     \"   60 Wine Glasses Broken         4:10:0\r\n     \"    8 Cutt decanters Broken       3: 0:0\r\n     \"    Coffee for 8 Gentlemen        1:12:0\r\n     \"    Music fees &ca                8: 0:0\r\n     \"    Fruit & Nuts                  5: 0:0\r\n     156:10:0\r\n     By Cash   .   .   .     100:16:0\r\n     55:14:0\r\n     WE a Committee of Council having examined\r\n     the above account do certify it (amounting to\r\n     one hundred and fifty-six Pounds ten Shillings)\r\n     to be just.\r\n     December 17th 1783.\r\n     ISAAC ROOSEVELT\r\n     JAS. DUANE\r\n     EGBT. BENSON\r\n     FRED. JAY\r\n     Received the above Contents in full\r\n     New York 17th December 1783\r\n     JOHN CAPE\r\n\r\nThink of the Governor of New York now submitting such a bill for such an\r\nentertainment of the French Ambassador and the President of the United\r\nStates! Falstaff's views of the proper proportion between sack and bread\r\nare borne out by the proportion between the number of bowls of punch and\r\nbottles of port, Madeira, and beer consumed, and the \"coffee for eight\r\ngentlemen\"--apparently the only ones who lasted through to that stage\r\nof the dinner. Especially admirable is the nonchalant manner in which,\r\nobviously as a result of the drinking of said bottles of wine and\r\nbowls of punch, it is recorded that eight cut-glass decanters and sixty\r\nwine-glasses were broken.\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolution some of my forefathers, North and South, served\r\nrespectably, but without distinction, in the army, and others rendered\r\nsimilar service in the Continental Congress or in various local\r\nlegislatures. By that time those who dwelt in the North were for the\r\nmost part merchants, and those who dwelt in the South, planters.\r\n\r\nMy mother's people were predominantly of Scotch, but also of Huguenot\r\nand English, descent. She was a Georgian, her people having come to\r\nGeorgia from South Carolina before the Revolution. The original Bulloch\r\nwas a lad from near Glasgow, who came hither a couple of centuries ago,\r\njust as hundreds of thousands of needy, enterprising Scotchmen have gone\r\nto the four quarters of the globe in the intervening two hundred\r\nyears. My mother's great-grandfather, Archibald Bulloch, was the first\r\nRevolutionary \"President\" of Georgia. My grandfather, her father, spent\r\nthe winters in Savannah and the summers at Roswell, in the Georgia\r\nuplands near Atlanta, finally making Roswell his permanent home. He\r\nused to travel thither with his family and their belongings in his own\r\ncarriage, followed by a baggage wagon. I never saw Roswell until I was\r\nPresident, but my mother told me so much about the place that when I did\r\nsee it I felt as if I already knew every nook and corner of it, and as\r\nif it were haunted by the ghosts of all the men and women who had lived\r\nthere. I do not mean merely my own family, I mean the slaves. My mother\r\nand her sister, my aunt, used to tell us children all kinds of stories\r\nabout the slaves. One of the most fascinating referred to a very old\r\ndarky called Bear Bob, because in the early days of settlement he had\r\nbeen partially scalped by a black bear. Then there was Mom' Grace, who\r\nwas for a time my mother's nurse, and whom I had supposed to be dead,\r\nbut who greeted me when I did come to Roswell, very respectable, and\r\napparently with years of life before her. The two chief personages of\r\nthe drama that used to be repeated to us were Daddy Luke, the Negro\r\noverseer, and his wife, Mom' Charlotte. I never saw either Daddy Luke\r\nor Mom' Charlotte, but I inherited the care of them when my mother died.\r\nAfter the close of the war they resolutely refused to be emancipated\r\nor leave the place. The only demand they made upon us was enough money\r\nannually to get a new \"critter,\" that is, a mule. With a certain lack of\r\ningenuity the mule was reported each Christmas as having passed away,\r\nor at least as having become so infirm as to necessitate a successor--a\r\nsolemn fiction which neither deceived nor was intended to deceive, but\r\nwhich furnished a gauge for the size of the Christmas gift.\r\n\r\nMy maternal grandfather's house was on the line of Sherman's march to\r\nthe sea, and pretty much everything in it that was portable was taken by\r\nthe boys in blue, including most of the books in the library. When I\r\nwas President the facts about my ancestry were published, and a\r\nformer soldier in Sherman's army sent me back one of the books with\r\nmy grandfather's name in it. It was a little copy of the poems of \"Mr.\r\nGray\"--an eighteenth-century edition printed in Glasgow.\r\n\r\nOn October 27, 1858, I was born at No. 28 East Twentieth Street, New\r\nYork City, in the house in which we lived during the time that my two\r\nsisters and my brother and I were small children. It was furnished\r\nin the canonical taste of the New York which George William Curtis\r\ndescribed in the _Potiphar Papers_. The black haircloth furniture in the\r\ndining-room scratched the bare legs of the children when they sat on\r\nit. The middle room was a library, with tables, chairs, and bookcases of\r\ngloomy respectability. It was without windows, and so was available only\r\nat night. The front room, the parlor, seemed to us children to be a room\r\nof much splendor, but was open for general use only on Sunday evening\r\nor on rare occasions when there were parties. The Sunday evening family\r\ngathering was the redeeming feature in a day which otherwise we children\r\ndid not enjoy--chiefly because we were all of us made to wear clean\r\nclothes and keep neat. The ornaments of that parlor I remember now,\r\nincluding the gas chandelier decorated with a great quantity of\r\ncut-glass prisms. These prisms struck me as possessing peculiar\r\nmagnificence. One of them fell off one day, and I hastily grabbed it and\r\nstowed it away, passing several days of furtive delight in the treasure,\r\na delight always alloyed with fear that I would be found out and\r\nconvicted of larceny. There was a Swiss wood-carving representing a very\r\nbig hunter on one side of an exceedingly small mountain, and a herd\r\nof chamois, disproportionately small for the hunter and large for the\r\nmountain, just across the ridge. This always fascinated us; but there\r\nwas a small chamois kid for which we felt agonies lest the hunter might\r\ncome on it and kill it. There was also a Russian moujik drawing a gilt\r\nsledge on a piece of malachite. Some one mentioned in my hearing that\r\nmalachite was a valuable marble. This fixed in my mind that it was\r\nvaluable exactly as diamonds are valuable. I accepted that moujik as\r\na priceless work of art, and it was not until I was well in middle age\r\nthat it occurred to me that I was mistaken.\r\n\r\nNow and then we children were taken round to our grandfather's house;\r\na big house for the New York of those days, on the corner of Fourteenth\r\nStreet and Broadway, fronting Union Square. Inside there was a large\r\nhall running up to the roof; there was a tessellated black-and-white\r\nmarble floor, and a circular staircase round the sides of the hall, from\r\nthe top floor down. We children much admired both the tessellated floor\r\nand the circular staircase. I think we were right about the latter, but\r\nI am not so sure as to the tessellated floor.\r\n\r\nThe summers we spent in the country, now at one place, now at another.\r\nWe children, of course, loved the country beyond anything. We disliked\r\nthe city. We were always wildly eager to get to the country when spring\r\ncame, and very sad when in the late fall the family moved back to town.\r\nIn the country we of course had all kinds of pets--cats, dogs, rabbits,\r\na coon, and a sorrel Shetland pony named General Grant. When my younger\r\nsister first heard of the real General Grant, by the way, she was much\r\nstruck by the coincidence that some one should have given him the same\r\nname as the pony. (Thirty years later my own children had _their_ pony\r\nGrant.) In the country we children ran barefoot much of the time,\r\nand the seasons went by in a round of uninterrupted and enthralling\r\npleasures--supervising the haying and harvesting, picking apples,\r\nhunting frogs successfully and woodchucks unsuccessfully, gathering\r\nhickory-nuts and chestnuts for sale to patient parents, building wigwams\r\nin the woods, and sometimes playing Indians in too realistic manner by\r\nstaining ourselves (and incidentally our clothes) in liberal fashion\r\nwith poke-cherry juice. Thanksgiving was an appreciated festival, but it\r\nin no way came up to Christmas. Christmas was an occasion of literally\r\ndelirious joy. In the evening we hung up our stockings--or rather the\r\nbiggest stockings we could borrow from the grown-ups--and before dawn we\r\ntrooped in to open them while sitting on father's and mother's bed;\r\nand the bigger presents were arranged, those for each child on its own\r\ntable, in the drawing-room, the doors to which were thrown open after\r\nbreakfast. I never knew any one else have what seemed to me such\r\nattractive Christmases, and in the next generation I tried to reproduce\r\nthem exactly for my own children.\r\n\r\nMy father, Theodore Roosevelt, was the best man I ever knew. He\r\ncombined strength and courage with gentleness, tenderness, and great\r\nunselfishness. He would not tolerate in us children selfishness or\r\ncruelty, idleness, cowardice, or untruthfulness. As we grew older he\r\nmade us understand that the same standard of clean living was demanded\r\nfor the boys as for the girls; that what was wrong in a woman could\r\nnot be right in a man. With great love and patience, and the most\r\nunderstanding sympathy and consideration, he combined insistence on\r\ndiscipline. He never physically punished me but once, but he was the\r\nonly man of whom I was ever really afraid. I do not mean that it was\r\na wrong fear, for he was entirely just, and we children adored him. We\r\nused to wait in the library in the evening until we could hear his key\r\nrattling in the latch of the front hall, and then rush out to greet him;\r\nand we would troop into his room while he was dressing, to stay there as\r\nlong as we were permitted, eagerly examining anything which came out\r\nof his pockets which could be regarded as an attractive novelty. Every\r\nchild has fixed in his memory various details which strike it as of\r\ngrave importance. The trinkets he used to keep in a little box on his\r\ndressing-table we children always used to speak of as \"treasures.\"\r\nThe word, and some of the trinkets themselves, passed on to the next\r\ngeneration. My own children, when small, used to troop into my room\r\nwhile I was dressing, and the gradually accumulating trinkets in the\r\n\"ditty-box\"--the gift of an enlisted man in the navy--always excited\r\nrapturous joy. On occasions of solemn festivity each child would receive\r\na trinket for his or her \"very own.\" My children, by the way, enjoyed\r\none pleasure I do not remember enjoying myself. When I came back from\r\nriding, the child who brought the bootjack would itself promptly get\r\ninto the boots, and clump up and down the room with a delightful feeling\r\nof kinship with Jack of the seven-league strides.\r\n\r\nThe punishing incident I have referred to happened when I was four years\r\nold. I bit my elder sister's arm. I do not remember biting her arm, but\r\nI do remember running down to the yard, perfectly conscious that I had\r\ncommitted a crime. From the yard I went into the kitchen, got some dough\r\nfrom the cook, and crawled under the kitchen table. In a minute or two\r\nmy father entered from the yard and asked where I was. The warm-hearted\r\nIrish cook had a characteristic contempt for \"informers,\" but although\r\nshe said nothing she compromised between informing and her conscience\r\nby casting a look under the table. My father immediately dropped on all\r\nfours and darted for me. I feebly heaved the dough at him, and, having\r\nthe advantage of him because I could stand up under the table, got\r\na fair start for the stairs, but was caught halfway up them. The\r\npunishment that ensued fitted the crime, and I hope--and believe--that\r\nit did me good.\r\n\r\nI never knew any one who got greater joy out of living than did my\r\nfather, or any one who more whole-heartedly performed every duty; and no\r\none whom I have ever met approached his combination of enjoyment of life\r\nand performance of duty. He and my mother were given to a hospitality\r\nthat at that time was associated more commonly with southern than\r\nnorthern households; and, especially in their later years when they\r\nhad moved up town, in the neighborhood of Central Park, they kept a\r\ncharming, open house.\r\n\r\nMy father worked hard at his business, for he died when he was\r\nforty-six, too early to have retired. He was interested in every social\r\nreform movement, and he did an immense amount of practical charitable\r\nwork himself. He was a big, powerful man, with a leonine face, and his\r\nheart filled with gentleness for those who needed help or protection,\r\nand with the possibility of much wrath against a bully or an oppressor.\r\nHe was very fond of riding both on the road and across the country, and\r\nwas also a great whip. He usually drove four-in-hand, or else a spike\r\nteam, that is, a pair with a third horse in the lead. I do not suppose\r\nthat such a team exists now. The trap that he drove we always called the\r\nhigh phaeton. The wheels turned under in front. I have it yet. He drove\r\nlong-tailed horses, harnessed loose in light American harness, so that\r\nthe whole rig had no possible resemblance to anything that would be seen\r\nnow. My father always excelled in improving every spare half-hour or\r\nthree-quarters of an hour, whether for work or enjoyment. Much of his\r\nfour-in-hand driving was done in the summer afternoons when he would\r\ncome out on the train from his business in New York. My mother and one\r\nor perhaps two of us children might meet him at the station. I can see\r\nhim now getting out of the car in his linen duster, jumping into\r\nthe wagon, and instantly driving off at a rattling pace, the duster\r\nsometimes bagging like a balloon. The four-in-hand, as can be gathered\r\nfrom the above description, did not in any way in his eyes represent\r\npossible pageantry. He drove it because he liked it. He was always\r\npreaching caution to his boys, but in this respect he did not practice\r\nhis preaching overmuch himself; and, being an excellent whip, he liked\r\nto take chances. Generally they came out all right. Occasionally they\r\ndid not; but he was even better at getting out of a scrape than into\r\nit. Once when we were driving into New York late at night the leaders\r\nstopped. He flicked them, and the next moment we could dimly make out\r\nthat they had jumped. It then appeared that the street was closed and\r\nthat a board had been placed across it, resting on two barrels, but\r\nwithout a lantern. Over this board the leaders had jumped, and there was\r\nconsiderable excitement before we got the board taken off the barrels\r\nand resumed our way. When in the city on Thanksgiving or Christmas, my\r\nfather was very apt to drive my mother and a couple of friends up to the\r\nracing park to take lunch. But he was always back in time to go to the\r\ndinner at the Newsboys' Lodging-House, and not infrequently also to\r\nMiss Sattery's Night School for little Italians. At a very early age we\r\nchildren were taken with him and were required to help. He was a staunch\r\nfriend of Charles Loring Brace, and was particularly interested in the\r\nNewsboys' Lodging-House and in the night schools and in getting the\r\nchildren off the streets and out on farms in the West. When I was\r\nPresident, the Governor of Alaska under me, Governor Brady, was one of\r\nthese ex-newsboys who had been sent from New York out West by Mr. Brace\r\nand my father. My father was greatly interested in the societies to\r\nprevent cruelty to children and cruelty to animals. On Sundays he had\r\na mission class. On his way to it he used to drop us children at our\r\nSunday-school in Dr. Adams's Presbyterian Church on Madison Square; I\r\nremember hearing my aunt, my mother's sister, saying that when he walked\r\nalong with us children he always reminded her of Greatheart in Bunyan.\r\nUnder the spur of his example I taught a mission class myself for three\r\nyears before going to college and for all four years that I was in\r\ncollege. I do not think I made much of a success of it. But the other\r\nday on getting out of a taxi in New York the chauffeur spoke to me and\r\ntold me that he was one of my old Sunday-school pupils. I remembered him\r\nwell, and was much pleased to find that he was an ardent Bull Mooser!\r\n\r\nMy mother, Martha Bulloch, was a sweet, gracious, beautiful Southern\r\nwoman, a delightful companion and beloved by everybody. She was entirely\r\n\"unreconstructed\" to the day of her death. Her mother, my grandmother,\r\none of the dearest of old ladies, lived with us, and was distinctly\r\noverindulgent to us children, being quite unable to harden her heart\r\ntowards us even when the occasion demanded it. Towards the close of the\r\nCivil War, although a very small boy, I grew to have a partial but alert\r\nunderstanding of the fact that the family were not one in their views\r\nabout that conflict, my father being a strong Lincoln Republican; and\r\nonce, when I felt that I had been wronged by maternal discipline during\r\nthe day, I attempted a partial vengeance by praying with loud fervor\r\nfor the success of the Union arms, when we all came to say our prayers\r\nbefore my mother in the evening. She was not only a most devoted mother,\r\nbut was also blessed with a strong sense of humor, and she was too much\r\namused to punish me; but I was warned not to repeat the offense, under\r\npenalty of my father's being informed--he being the dispenser of serious\r\npunishment. Morning prayers were with my father. We used to stand at the\r\nfoot of the stairs, and when father came down we called out, \"I speak\r\nfor you and the cubby-hole too!\" There were three of us young children,\r\nand we used to sit with father on the sofa while he conducted morning\r\nprayers. The place between father and the arm of the sofa we called the\r\n\"cubby-hole.\" The child who got that place we regarded as especially\r\nfavored both in comfort and somehow or other in rank and title. The two\r\nwho were left to sit on the much wider expanse of sofa on the other side\r\nof father were outsiders for the time being.\r\n\r\nMy aunt Anna, my mother's sister, lived with us. She was as devoted to\r\nus children as was my mother herself, and we were equally devoted to her\r\nin return. She taught us our lessons while we were little. She and\r\nmy mother used to entertain us by the hour with tales of life on\r\nthe Georgia plantations; of hunting fox, deer, and wildcat; of the\r\nlong-tailed driving horses, Boone and Crockett, and of the riding\r\nhorses, one of which was named Buena Vista in a fit of patriotic\r\nexaltation during the Mexican War; and of the queer goings-on in the\r\nNegro quarters. She knew all the \"Br'er Rabbit\" stories, and I was\r\nbrought up on them. One of my uncles, Robert Roosevelt, was much struck\r\nwith them, and took them down from her dictation, publishing them in\r\n_Harper's_, where they fell flat. This was a good many years before a\r\ngenius arose who in \"Uncle Remus\" made the stories immortal.\r\n\r\nMy mother's two brothers, James Dunwoodie Bulloch and Irvine Bulloch,\r\ncame to visit us shortly after the close of the war. Both came under\r\nassumed names, as they were among the Confederates who were at that time\r\nexempted from the amnesty. \"Uncle Jimmy\" Bulloch was a dear old retired\r\nsea-captain, utterly unable to \"get on\" in the worldly sense of that\r\nphrase, as valiant and simple and upright a soul as ever lived, a\r\nveritable Colonel Newcome. He was an Admiral in the Confederate navy,\r\nand was the builder of the famous Confederate war vessel Alabama. My\r\nuncle Irvine Bulloch was a midshipman on the _Alabama_, and fired\r\nthe last gun discharged from her batteries in the fight with the\r\n_Kearsarge_. Both of these uncles lived in Liverpool after the war.\r\n\r\nMy uncle Jimmy Bulloch was forgiving and just in reference to the\r\nUnion forces, and could discuss all phases of the Civil War with entire\r\nfairness and generosity. But in English politics he promptly became a\r\nTory of the most ultra-conservative school. Lincoln and Grant he could\r\nadmire, but he would not listen to anything in favor of Mr. Gladstone.\r\nThe only occasions on which I ever shook his faith in me were when I\r\nwould venture meekly to suggest that some of the manifestly preposterous\r\nfalsehoods about Mr. Gladstone could not be true. My uncle was one of\r\nthe best men I have ever known, and when I have sometimes been tempted\r\nto wonder how good people can believe of me the unjust and impossible\r\nthings they do believe, I have consoled myself by thinking of Uncle\r\nJimmy Bulloch's perfectly sincere conviction that Gladstone was a man of\r\nquite exceptional and nameless infamy in both public and private life.\r\n\r\nI was a sickly, delicate boy, suffered much from asthma, and frequently\r\nhad to be taken away on trips to find a place where I could breathe. One\r\nof my memories is of my father walking up and down the room with me in\r\nhis arms at night when I was a very small person, and of sitting up in\r\nbed gasping, with my father and mother trying to help me. I went very\r\nlittle to school. I never went to the public schools, as my own children\r\nlater did, both at the \"Cove School\" at Oyster Bay and at the \"Ford\r\nSchool\" in Washington. For a few months I attended Professor McMullen's\r\nschool in Twentieth Street near the house where I was born, but most of\r\nthe time I had tutors. As I have already said, my aunt taught me when\r\nI was small. At one time we had a French governess, a loved and valued\r\n\"mam'selle,\" in the household.\r\n\r\nWhen I was ten years old I made my first journey to Europe. My birthday\r\nwas spent in Cologne, and in order to give me a thoroughly \"party\"\r\nfeeling I remember that my mother put on full dress for my birthday\r\ndinner. I do not think I gained anything from this particular trip\r\nabroad. I cordially hated it, as did my younger brother and sister.\r\nPractically all the enjoyment we had was in exploring any ruins or\r\nmountains when we could get away from our elders, and in playing in\r\nthe different hotels. Our one desire was to get back to America, and\r\nwe regarded Europe with the most ignorant chauvinism and contempt. Four\r\nyears later, however, I made another journey to Europe, and was old\r\nenough to enjoy it thoroughly and profit by it.\r\n\r\nWhile still a small boy I began to take an interest in natural history.\r\nI remember distinctly the first day that I started on my career as\r\nzoologist. I was walking up Broadway, and as I passed the market to\r\nwhich I used sometimes to be sent before breakfast to get strawberries I\r\nsuddenly saw a dead seal laid out on a slab of wood. That seal filled me\r\nwith every possible feeling of romance and adventure. I asked where it\r\nwas killed, and was informed in the harbor. I had already begun to read\r\nsome of Mayne Reid's books and other boys' books of adventure, and I\r\nfelt that this seal brought all these adventures in realistic\r\nfashion before me. As long as that seal remained there I haunted the\r\nneighborhood of the market day after day. I measured it, and I recall\r\nthat, not having a tape measure, I had to do my best to get its girth\r\nwith a folding pocket foot-rule, a difficult undertaking. I carefully\r\nmade a record of the utterly useless measurements, and at once began to\r\nwrite a natural history of my own, on the strength of that seal. This,\r\nand subsequent natural histories, were written down in blank books in\r\nsimplified spelling, wholly unpremeditated and unscientific. I had vague\r\naspirations of in some way or another owning and preserving that seal,\r\nbut they never got beyond the purely formless stage. I think, however,\r\nI did get the seal's skull, and with two of my cousins promptly started\r\nwhat we ambitiously called the \"Roosevelt Museum of Natural History.\"\r\nThe collections were at first kept in my room, until a rebellion on the\r\npart of the chambermaid received the approval of the higher authorities\r\nof the household and the collection was moved up to a kind of bookcase\r\nin the back hall upstairs. It was the ordinary small boy's collection\r\nof curios, quite incongruous and entirely valueless except from the\r\nstandpoint of the boy himself. My father and mother encouraged me warmly\r\nin this, as they always did in anything that could give me wholesome\r\npleasure or help to develop me.\r\n\r\nThe adventure of the seal and the novels of Mayne Reid together\r\nstrengthened my instinctive interest in natural history. I was too young\r\nto understand much of Mayne Reid, excepting the adventure part and the\r\nnatural history part--these enthralled me. But of course my reading was\r\nnot wholly confined to natural history. There was very little effort\r\nmade to compel me to read books, my father and mother having the good\r\nsense not to try to get me to read anything I did not like, unless it\r\nwas in the way of study. I was given the chance to read books that they\r\nthought I ought to read, but if I did not like them I was then given\r\nsome other good book that I did like. There were certain books that were\r\ntaboo. For instance, I was not allowed to read dime novels. I obtained\r\nsome surreptitiously and did read them, but I do not think that the\r\nenjoyment compensated for the feeling of guilt. I was also forbidden to\r\nread the only one of Ouida's books which I wished to read--\"Under Two\r\nFlags.\" I did read it, nevertheless, with greedy and fierce hope of\r\ncoming on something unhealthy; but as a matter of fact all the parts\r\nthat might have seemed unhealthy to an older person made no impression\r\non me whatever. I simply enjoyed in a rather confused way the general\r\nadventures.\r\n\r\nI think there ought to be children's books. I think that the child will\r\nlike grown-up books also, and I do not believe a child's book is really\r\ngood unless grown-ups get something out of it. For instance, there is a\r\nbook I did not have when I was a child because it was not written. It is\r\nLaura E. Richard's \"Nursery Rhymes.\" My own children loved them dearly,\r\nand their mother and I loved them almost equally; the delightfully\r\nlight-hearted \"Man from New Mexico who Lost his Grandmother out in the\r\nSnow,\" the adventures of \"The Owl, the Eel, and the Warming-Pan,\" and\r\nthe extraordinary genealogy of the kangaroo whose \"father was a whale\r\nwith a feather in his tail who lived in the Greenland sea,\" while \"his\r\nmother was a shark who kept very dark in the Gulf of Caribee.\"\r\n\r\nAs a small boy I had _Our Young Folks_, which I then firmly believed\r\nto be the very best magazine in the world--a belief, I may add, which I\r\nhave kept to this day unchanged, for I seriously doubt if any magazine\r\nfor old or young has ever surpassed it. Both my wife and I have the\r\nbound volumes of _Our Young Folks_ which we preserved from our youth. I\r\nhave tried to read again the Mayne Reid books which I so dearly loved as\r\na boy, only to find, alas! that it is impossible. But I really believe\r\nthat I enjoy going over _Our Young Folks_ now nearly as much as ever.\r\n\"Cast Away in the Cold,\" \"Grandfather's Struggle for a Homestead,\" \"The\r\nWilliam Henry Letters,\" and a dozen others like them were first-class,\r\ngood healthy stories, interesting in the first place, and in the next\r\nplace teaching manliness, decency, and good conduct. At the cost of\r\nbeing deemed effeminate, I will add that I greatly liked the girls'\r\nstories--\"Pussy Willow\" and \"A Summer in Leslie Goldthwaite's\r\nLife,\" just as I worshiped \"Little Men\" and \"Little Women\" and \"An\r\nOld-Fashioned Girl.\"\r\n\r\nThis enjoyment of the gentler side of life did not prevent my reveling\r\nin such tales of adventure as Ballantyne's stories, or Marryat's\r\n\"Midshipman Easy.\" I suppose everybody has kinks in him, and even as\r\na child there were books which I ought to have liked and did not. For\r\ninstance, I never cared at all for the first part of \"Robinson Crusoe\"\r\n(and although it is unquestionably the best part, I do not care for it\r\nnow); whereas the second part, containing the adventures of Robinson\r\nCrusoe, with the wolves in the Pyrenees, and out in the Far East, simply\r\nfascinated me. What I did like in the first part were the adventures\r\nbefore Crusoe finally reached his island, the fight with the Sallee\r\nRover, and the allusion to the strange beasts at night taking their\r\nimprobable bath in the ocean. Thanks to being already an embryo\r\nzoologist, I disliked the \"Swiss Family Robinson\" because of the wholly\r\nimpossible collection of animals met by that worthy family as they\r\nambled inland from the wreck. Even in poetry it was the relation of\r\nadventures that most appealed to me as a boy. At a pretty early age I\r\nbegan to read certain books of poetry, notably Longfellow's poem,\r\n\"The Saga of King Olaf,\" which absorbed me. This introduced me to\r\nScandinavian literature; and I have never lost my interest in and\r\naffection for it.\r\n\r\nAmong my first books was a volume of a hopelessly unscientific kind by\r\nMayne Reid, about mammals, illustrated with pictures no more artistic\r\nthan but quite as thrilling as those in the typical school geography.\r\nWhen my father found how deeply interested I was in this not very\r\naccurate volume, he gave me a little book by J. G. Wood, the English\r\nwriter of popular books on natural history, and then a larger one of his\r\ncalled \"Homes Without Hands.\" Both of these were cherished possessions.\r\nThey were studied eagerly; and they finally descended to my children.\r\nThe \"Homes Without Hands,\" by the way, grew to have an added association\r\nin connection with a pedagogical failure on my part. In accordance\r\nwith what I believed was some kind of modern theory of making education\r\ninteresting and not letting it become a task, I endeavored to teach my\r\neldest small boy one or two of his letters from the title-page. As the\r\nletter \"H\" appeared in the title an unusual number of times, I selected\r\nthat to begin on, my effort being to keep the small boy interested, not\r\nto let him realize that he was learning a lesson, and to convince him\r\nthat he was merely having a good time. Whether it was the theory or my\r\nmethod of applying it that was defective I do not know, but I certainly\r\nabsolutely eradicated from his brain any ability to learn what \"H\" was;\r\nand long after he had learned all the other letters of the alphabet in\r\nthe old-fashioned way, he proved wholly unable to remember \"H\" under any\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nQuite unknown to myself, I was, while a boy, under a hopeless\r\ndisadvantage in studying nature. I was very near-sighted, so that the\r\nonly things I could study were those I ran against or stumbled over.\r\nWhen I was about thirteen I was allowed to take lessons in taxidermy\r\nfrom a Mr. Bell, a tall, clean-shaven, white-haired old gentleman, as\r\nstraight as an Indian, who had been a companion of Audubon's. He had\r\na musty little shop, somewhat on the order of Mr. Venus's shop in \"Our\r\nMutual Friend,\" a little shop in which he had done very valuable work\r\nfor science. This \"vocational study,\" as I suppose it would be called\r\nby modern educators, spurred and directed my interest in collecting\r\nspecimens for mounting and preservation. It was this summer that I got\r\nmy first gun, and it puzzled me to find that my companions seemed to see\r\nthings to shoot at which I could not see at all. One day they read aloud\r\nan advertisement in huge letters on a distant billboard, and I then\r\nrealized that something was the matter, for not only was I unable to\r\nread the sign but I could not even see the letters. I spoke of this to\r\nmy father, and soon afterwards got my first pair of spectacles,\r\nwhich literally opened an entirely new world to me. I had no idea how\r\nbeautiful the world was until I got those spectacles. I had been a\r\nclumsy and awkward little boy, and while much of my clumsiness and\r\nawkwardness was doubtless due to general characteristics, a good deal of\r\nit was due to the fact that I could not see and yet was wholly ignorant\r\nthat I was not seeing. The recollection of this experience gives me\r\na keen sympathy with those who are trying in our public schools and\r\nelsewhere to remove the physical causes of deficiency in children,\r\nwho are often unjustly blamed for being obstinate or unambitious, or\r\nmentally stupid.\r\n\r\nThis same summer, too, I obtained various new books on mammals and\r\nbirds, including the publications of Spencer Baird, for instance, and\r\nmade an industrious book-study of the subject. I did not accomplish\r\nmuch in outdoor study because I did not get spectacles until late in the\r\nfall, a short time before I started with the rest of the family for a\r\nsecond trip to Europe. We were living at Dobbs Ferry, on the Hudson. My\r\ngun was a breech-loading, pin-fire double-barrel, of French manufacture.\r\nIt was an excellent gun for a clumsy and often absent-minded boy. There\r\nwas no spring to open it, and if the mechanism became rusty it could be\r\nopened with a brick without serious damage. When the cartridges stuck\r\nthey could be removed in the same fashion. If they were loaded, however,\r\nthe result was not always happy, and I tattooed myself with partially\r\nunburned grains of powder more than once.\r\n\r\nWhen I was fourteen years old, in the winter of '72 and '73, I visited\r\nEurope for the second time, and this trip formed a really useful part of\r\nmy education. We went to Egypt, journeyed up the Nile, traveled through\r\nthe Holy Land and part of Syria, visited Greece and Constantinople;\r\nand then we children spent the summer in a German family in Dresden. My\r\nfirst real collecting as a student of natural history was done in Egypt\r\nduring this journey. By this time I had a good working knowledge of\r\nAmerican bird life from the superficially scientific standpoint. I had\r\nno knowledge of the ornithology of Egypt, but I picked up in Cairo\r\na book by an English clergyman, whose name I have now forgotten, who\r\ndescribed a trip up the Nile, and in an appendix to his volume gave an\r\naccount of his bird collection. I wish I could remember the name of the\r\nauthor now, for I owe that book very much. Without it I should have been\r\ncollecting entirely in the dark, whereas with its aid I could generally\r\nfind out what the birds were. My first knowledge of Latin was obtained\r\nby learning the scientific names of the birds and mammals which I\r\ncollected and classified by the aid of such books as this one.\r\n\r\nThe birds I obtained up the Nile and in Palestine represented merely the\r\nusual boy's collection. Some years afterward I gave them, together with\r\nthe other ornithological specimens I had gathered, to the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution in Washington, and I think some of them also to the American\r\nMuseum of Natural History in New York. I am told that the skins are to\r\nbe found yet in both places and in other public collections. I doubt\r\nwhether they have my original labels on them. With great pride the\r\ndirectors of the \"Roosevelt Museum,\" consisting of myself and the two\r\ncousins aforesaid, had printed a set of Roosevelt Museum labels in pink\r\nink preliminary to what was regarded as my adventurous trip to Egypt.\r\nThis bird-collecting gave what was really the chief zest to my Nile\r\njourney. I was old enough and had read enough to enjoy the temples and\r\nthe desert scenery and the general feeling of romance; but this in time\r\nwould have palled if I had not also had the serious work of collecting\r\nand preparing my specimens. Doubtless the family had their moments of\r\nsuffering--especially on one occasion when a well-meaning maid extracted\r\nfrom my taxidermist's outfit the old tooth-brush with which I put on\r\nthe skins the arsenical soap necessary for their preservation, partially\r\nwashed it, and left it with the rest of my wash kit for my own personal\r\nuse. I suppose that all growing boys tend to be grubby; but the\r\nornithological small boy, or indeed the boy with the taste for natural\r\nhistory of any kind, is generally the very grubbiest of all. An added\r\nelement in my case was the fact that while in Egypt I suddenly started\r\nto grow. As there were no tailors up the Nile, when I got back to Cairo\r\nI needed a new outfit. But there was one suit of clothes too good to\r\nthrow away, which we kept for a \"change,\" and which was known as my\r\n\"Smike suit,\" because it left my wrists and ankles as bare as those of\r\npoor Smike himself.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Dresden we younger children were left to spend the\r\nsummer in the house of Herr Minckwitz, a member of either the Municipal\r\nor the Saxon Government--I have forgotten which. It was hoped that in\r\nthis way we would acquire some knowledge of the German language and\r\nliterature. They were the very kindest family imaginable. I shall never\r\nforget the unwearied patience of the two daughters. The father and\r\nmother, and a shy, thin, student cousin who was living in the flat,\r\nwere no less kind. Whenever I could get out into the country I collected\r\nspecimens industriously and enlivened the household with hedge-hogs\r\nand other small beasts and reptiles which persisted in escaping from\r\npartially closed bureau drawers. The two sons were fascinating students\r\nfrom the University of Leipsic, both of them belonging to dueling corps,\r\nand much scarred in consequence. One, a famous swordsman, was called\r\n_Der Rothe Herzog_ (the Red Duke), and the other was nicknamed _Herr\r\nNasehorn_ (Sir Rhinoceros) because the tip of his nose had been cut off\r\nin a duel and sewn on again. I learned a good deal of German here,\r\nin spite of myself, and above all I became fascinated with the\r\nNibelungenlied. German prose never became really easy to me in the sense\r\nthat French prose did, but for German poetry I cared as much as for\r\nEnglish poetry. Above all, I gained an impression of the German people\r\nwhich I never got over. From that time to this it would have been quite\r\nimpossible to make me feel that the Germans were really foreigners.\r\nThe affection, the _Gemuthlichkeit_ (a quality which cannot be exactly\r\nexpressed by any single English word), the capacity for hard work, the\r\nsense of duty, the delight in studying literature and science, the pride\r\nin the new Germany, the more than kind and friendly interest in three\r\nstrange children--all these manifestations of the German character and\r\nof German family life made a subconscious impression upon me which I did\r\nnot in the least define at the time, but which is very vivid still forty\r\nyears later.\r\n\r\nWhen I got back to America, at the age of fifteen, I began serious study\r\nto enter Harvard under Mr. Arthur Cutler, who later founded the Cutler\r\nSchool in New York. I could not go to school because I knew so much less\r\nthan most boys of my age in some subjects and so much more in others. In\r\nscience and history and geography and in unexpected parts of German\r\nand French I was strong, but lamentably weak in Latin and Greek and\r\nmathematics. My grandfather had made his summer home in Oyster Bay a\r\nnumber of years before, and my father now made Oyster Bay the summer\r\nhome of his family also. Along with my college preparatory studies I\r\ncarried on the work of a practical student of natural history. I worked\r\nwith greater industry than either intelligence or success, and made very\r\nfew additions to the sum of human knowledge; but to this day certain\r\nobscure ornithological publications may be found in which are recorded\r\nsuch items as, for instance, that on one occasion a fish-crow, and on\r\nanother an Ipswich sparrow, were obtained by one Theodore Roosevelt,\r\nJr., at Oyster Bay, on the shore of Long Island Sound.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1876 I entered Harvard, graduating in 1880. I thoroughly\r\nenjoyed Harvard, and I am sure it did me good, but only in the general\r\neffect, for there was very little in my actual studies which helped me\r\nin after life. More than one of my own sons have already profited by\r\ntheir friendship with certain of their masters in school or college. I\r\ncertainly profited by my friendship with one of my tutors, Mr. Cutler;\r\nand in Harvard I owed much to the professor of English, Mr. A. S. Hill.\r\nDoubtless through my own fault, I saw almost nothing of President Eliot\r\nand very little of the professors. I ought to have gained much more than\r\nI did gain from writing the themes and forensics. My failure to do\r\nso may have been partly due to my taking no interest in the subjects.\r\nBefore I left Harvard I was already writing one or two chapters of a\r\nbook I afterwards published on the Naval War of 1812. Those chapters\r\nwere so dry that they would have made a dictionary seem light reading by\r\ncomparison. Still, they represented purpose and serious interest on\r\nmy part, not the perfunctory effort to do well enough to get a certain\r\nmark; and corrections of them by a skilled older man would have\r\nimpressed me and have commanded my respectful attention. But I was not\r\nsufficiently developed to make myself take an intelligent interest in\r\nsome of the subjects assigned me--the character of the Gracchi, for\r\ninstance. A very clever and studious lad would no doubt have done so,\r\nbut I personally did not grow up to this particular subject until a good\r\nmany years later. The frigate and sloop actions between the American\r\nand British sea-tigers of 1812 were much more within my grasp. I\r\nworked drearily at the Gracchi because I had to; my conscientious\r\nand much-to-be-pitied professor dragging me through the theme by main\r\nstrength, with my feet firmly planted in dull and totally idea-proof\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nI had at the time no idea of going into public life, and I never studied\r\nelocution or practiced debating. This was a loss to me in one way. In\r\nanother way it was not. Personally I have not the slightest sympathy\r\nwith debating contests in which each side is arbitrarily assigned a\r\ngiven proposition and told to maintain it without the least reference to\r\nwhether those maintaining it believe in it or not. I know that under our\r\nsystem this is necessary for lawyers, but I emphatically disbelieve in\r\nit as regards general discussion of political, social, and industrial\r\nmatters. What we need is to turn out of our colleges young men with\r\nardent convictions on the side of the right; not young men who can make\r\na good argument for either right or wrong as their interest bids them.\r\nThe present method of carrying on debates on such subjects as \"Our\r\nColonial Policy,\" or \"The Need of a Navy,\" or \"The Proper Position of\r\nthe Courts in Constitutional Questions,\" encourages precisely the\r\nwrong attitude among those who take part in them. There is no effort to\r\ninstill sincerity and intensity of conviction. On the contrary, the\r\nnet result is to make the contestants feel that their convictions have\r\nnothing to do with their arguments. I am sorry I did not study elocution\r\nin college; but I am exceedingly glad that I did not take part in the\r\ntype of debate in which stress is laid, not upon getting a speaker to\r\nthink rightly, but on getting him to talk glibly on the side to which\r\nhe is assigned, without regard either to what his convictions are or to\r\nwhat they ought to be.\r\n\r\nI was a reasonably good student in college, standing just within the\r\nfirst tenth of my class, if I remember rightly; although I am not sure\r\nwhether this means the tenth of the whole number that entered or of\r\nthose that graduated. I was given a Phi Beta Kappa \"key.\" My chief\r\ninterests were scientific. When I entered college, I was devoted to\r\nout-of-doors natural history, and my ambition was to be a scientific\r\nman of the Audubon, or Wilson, or Baird, or Coues type--a man like Hart\r\nMerriam, or Frank Chapman, or Hornaday, to-day. My father had from the\r\nearliest days instilled into me the knowledge that I was to work and to\r\nmake my own way in the world, and I had always supposed that this meant\r\nthat I must enter business. But in my freshman year (he died when I was\r\na sophomore) he told me that if I wished to become a scientific man I\r\ncould do so. He explained that I must be sure that I really intensely\r\ndesired to do scientific work, because if I went into it I must make it\r\na serious career; that he had made enough money to enable me to take up\r\nsuch a career and do non-remunerative work of value _if I intended to do\r\nthe very best work there was in me_; but that I must not dream of taking\r\nit up as a dilettante. He also gave me a piece of advice that I have\r\nalways remembered, namely, that, if I was not going to earn money, I\r\nmust even things up by not spending it. As he expressed it, I had\r\nto keep the fraction constant, and if I was not able to increase the\r\nnumerator, then I must reduce the denominator. In other words, if I went\r\ninto a scientific career, I must definitely abandon all thought of the\r\nenjoyment that could accompany a money-making career, and must find my\r\npleasures elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAfter this conversation I fully intended to make science my life-work. I\r\ndid not, for the simple reason that at that time Harvard, and I suppose\r\nour other colleges, utterly ignored the possibilities of the faunal\r\nnaturalist, the outdoor naturalist and observer of nature. They treated\r\nbiology as purely a science of the laboratory and the microscope, a\r\nscience whose adherents were to spend their time in the study of minute\r\nforms of marine life, or else in section-cutting and the study of the\r\ntissues of the higher organisms under the microscope. This attitude was,\r\nno doubt, in part due to the fact that in most colleges then there was\r\na not always intelligent copying of what was done in the great German\r\nuniversities. The sound revolt against superficiality of study had been\r\ncarried to an extreme; thoroughness in minutiae as the only end of study\r\nhad been erected into a fetish. There was a total failure to understand\r\nthe great variety of kinds of work that could be done by naturalists,\r\nincluding what could be done by outdoor naturalists--the kind of work\r\nwhich Hart Merriam and his assistants in the Biological Survey have\r\ncarried to such a high degree of perfection as regards North American\r\nmammals. In the entirely proper desire to be thorough and to avoid\r\nslipshod methods, the tendency was to treat as not serious, as\r\nunscientific, any kind of work that was not carried on with laborious\r\nminuteness in the laboratory. My taste was specialized in a totally\r\ndifferent direction, and I had no more desire or ability to be a\r\nmicroscopist and section-cutter than to be a mathematician. Accordingly\r\nI abandoned all thought of becoming a scientist. Doubtless this meant\r\nthat I really did not have the intense devotion to science which I\r\nthought I had; for, if I had possessed such devotion, I would\r\nhave carved out a career for myself somehow without regard to\r\ndiscouragements.\r\n\r\nAs regards political economy, I was of course while in college taught\r\nthe _laissez-faire_ doctrines--one of them being free trade--then\r\naccepted as canonical. Most American boys of my age were taught both by\r\ntheir surroundings and by their studies certain principles which were\r\nvery valuable from the standpoint of National interest, and certain\r\nothers which were very much the reverse. The political economists were\r\nnot especially to blame for this; it was the general attitude of the\r\nwriters who wrote for us of that generation. Take my beloved _Our Young\r\nFolks_, the magazine of which I have already spoken, and which taught\r\nme much more than any of my text-books. Everything in this magazine\r\ninstilled the individual virtues, and the necessity of character as the\r\nchief factor in any man's success--a teaching in which I now believe as\r\nsincerely as ever, for all the laws that the wit of man can devise will\r\nnever make a man a worthy citizen unless he has within himself the\r\nright stuff, unless he has self-reliance, energy, courage, the power of\r\ninsisting on his own rights and the sympathy that makes him regardful of\r\nthe rights of others. All this individual morality I was taught by the\r\nbooks I read at home and the books I studied at Harvard. But there was\r\nalmost no teaching of the need for collective action, and of the fact\r\nthat in addition to, not as a substitute for, individual responsibility,\r\nthere is a collective responsibility. Books such as Herbert Croly's\r\n\"Promise of American Life\" and Walter E. Weyl's \"New Democracy\" would\r\ngenerally at that time have been treated either as unintelligible or\r\nelse as pure heresy.\r\n\r\nThe teaching which I received was genuinely democratic in one way. It\r\nwas not so democratic in another. I grew into manhood thoroughly imbued\r\nwith the feeling that a man must be respected for what he made of\r\nhimself. But I had also, consciously or unconsciously, been taught that\r\nsocially and industrially pretty much the whole duty of the man lay\r\nin thus making the best of himself; that he should be honest in his\r\ndealings with others and charitable in the old-fashioned way to the\r\nunfortunate; but that it was no part of his business to join with others\r\nin trying to make things better for the many by curbing the abnormal and\r\nexcessive development of individualism in a few. Now I do not mean that\r\nthis training was by any means all bad. On the contrary, the insistence\r\nupon individual responsibility was, and is, and always will be, a prime\r\nnecessity. Teaching of the kind I absorbed from both my text-books and\r\nmy surroundings is a healthy anti-scorbutic to the sentimentality which\r\nby complacently excusing the individual for all his shortcomings would\r\nfinally hopelessly weaken the spring of moral purpose. It also keeps\r\nalive that virile vigor for the lack of which in the average individual\r\nno possible perfection of law or of community action can ever atone. But\r\nsuch teaching, if not corrected by other teaching, means acquiescence\r\nin a riot of lawless business individualism which would be quite as\r\ndestructive to real civilization as the lawless military individualism\r\nof the Dark Ages. I left college and entered the big world owing more\r\nthan I can express to the training I had received, especially in my own\r\nhome; but with much else also to learn if I were to become really fitted\r\nto do my part in the work that lay ahead for the generation of Americans\r\nto which I belonged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE VIGOR OF LIFE\r\n\r\nLooking back, a man really has a more objective feeling about himself\r\nas a child than he has about his father or mother. He feels as if that\r\nchild were not the present he, individually, but an ancestor; just as\r\nmuch an ancestor as either of his parents. The saying that the child is\r\nthe father to the man may be taken in a sense almost the reverse of that\r\nusually given to it. The child is father to the man in the sense that\r\nhis individuality is separate from the individuality of the grown-up\r\ninto which he turns. This is perhaps one reason why a man can speak of\r\nhis childhood and early youth with a sense of detachment.\r\n\r\nHaving been a sickly boy, with no natural bodily prowess, and having\r\nlived much at home, I was at first quite unable to hold my own when\r\nthrown into contact with other boys of rougher antecedents. I was\r\nnervous and timid. Yet from reading of the people I admired--ranging\r\nfrom the soldiers of Valley Forge, and Morgan's riflemen, to the heroes\r\nof my favorite stories--and from hearing of the feats performed by my\r\nSouthern forefathers and kinsfolk, and from knowing my father, I felt a\r\ngreat admiration for men who were fearless and who could hold their\r\nown in the world, and I had a great desire to be like them. Until I\r\nwas nearly fourteen I let this desire take no more definite shape than\r\nday-dreams. Then an incident happened that did me real good. Having an\r\nattack of asthma, I was sent off by myself to Moosehead Lake. On the\r\nstage-coach ride thither I encountered a couple of other boys who\r\nwere about my own age, but very much more competent and also much more\r\nmischievous. I have no doubt they were good-hearted boys, but they were\r\nboys! They found that I was a foreordained and predestined victim, and\r\nindustriously proceeded to make life miserable for me. The worst feature\r\nwas that when I finally tried to fight them I discovered that either one\r\nsingly could not only handle me with easy contempt, but handle me so as\r\nnot to hurt me much and yet to prevent my doing any damage whatever in\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nThe experience taught me what probably no amount of good advice could\r\nhave taught me. I made up my mind that I must try to learn so that I\r\nwould not again be put in such a helpless position; and having become\r\nquickly and bitterly conscious that I did not have the natural prowess\r\nto hold my own, I decided that I would try to supply its place by\r\ntraining. Accordingly, with my father's hearty approval, I started to\r\nlearn to box. I was a painfully slow and awkward pupil, and certainly\r\nworked two or three years before I made any perceptible improvement\r\nwhatever. My first boxing-master was John Long, an ex-prize-fighter. I\r\ncan see his rooms now, with colored pictures of the fights between Tom\r\nHyer and Yankee Sullivan, and Heenan and Sayers, and other great events\r\nin the annals of the squared circle. On one occasion, to excite interest\r\namong his patrons, he held a series of \"championship\" matches for the\r\ndifferent weights, the prizes being, at least in my own class, pewter\r\nmugs of a value, I should suppose, approximating fifty cents. Neither\r\nhe nor I had any idea that I could do anything, but I was entered in\r\nthe lightweight contest, in which it happened that I was pitted in\r\nsuccession against a couple of reedy striplings who were even worse than\r\nI was. Equally to their surprise and to my own, and to John Long's, I\r\nwon, and the pewter mug became one of my most prized possessions. I\r\nkept it, and alluded to it, and I fear bragged about it, for a number\r\nof years, and I only wish I knew where it was now. Years later I read\r\nan account of a little man who once in a fifth-rate handicap race won\r\na worthless pewter medal and joyed in it ever after. Well, as soon as I\r\nread that story I felt that that little man and I were brothers.\r\n\r\nThis was, as far as I remember, the only one of my exceedingly rare\r\nathletic triumphs which would be worth relating. I did a good deal of\r\nboxing and wrestling in Harvard, but never attained to the first rank in\r\neither, even at my own weight. Once, in the big contests in the Gym,\r\nI got either into the finals or semi-finals, I forget which; but aside\r\nfrom this the chief part I played was to act as trial horse for some\r\nfriend or classmate who did have a chance of distinguishing himself in\r\nthe championship contests.\r\n\r\nI was fond of horseback-riding, but I took to it slowly and with\r\ndifficulty, exactly as with boxing. It was a long time before I became\r\neven a respectable rider, and I never got much higher. I mean by this\r\nthat I never became a first-flight man in the hunting field, and never\r\neven approached the bronco-busting class in the West. Any man, if\r\nhe chooses, can gradually school himself to the requisite nerve, and\r\ngradually learn the requisite seat and hands, that will enable him to do\r\nrespectably across country, or to perform the average work on a ranch.\r\nOf my ranch experiences I shall speak later. At intervals after leaving\r\ncollege I hunted on Long Island with the Meadowbrook hounds. Almost the\r\nonly experience I ever had in this connection that was of any interest\r\nwas on one occasion when I broke my arm. My purse did not permit me to\r\nown expensive horses. On this occasion I was riding an animal, a buggy\r\nhorse originally, which its owner sold because now and then it insisted\r\non thoughtfully lying down when in harness. It never did this under the\r\nsaddle; and when he turned it out to grass it would solemnly hop over\r\nthe fence and get somewhere where it did not belong. The last trait\r\nwas what converted it into a hunter. It was a natural jumper, although\r\nwithout any speed. On the hunt in question I got along very well until\r\nthe pace winded my ex-buggy horse, and it turned a somersault over a\r\nfence. When I got on it after the fall I found I could not use my left\r\narm. I supposed it was merely a strain. The buggy horse was a sedate\r\nanimal which I rode with a snaffle. So we pounded along at the tail of\r\nthe hunt, and I did not appreciate that my arm was broken for three or\r\nfour fences. Then we came to a big drop, and the jar made the bones slip\r\npast one another so as to throw the hand out of position. It did not\r\nhurt me at all, and as the horse was as easy to sit as a rocking-chair,\r\nI got in at the death.\r\n\r\nI think August Belmont was master of the hunt when the above incident\r\noccurred. I know he was master on another occasion on which I met with\r\na mild adventure. On one of the hunts when I was out a man was thrown,\r\ndragged by one stirrup, and killed. In consequence I bought a pair of\r\nsafety stirrups, which I used the next time I went out. Within five\r\nminutes after the run began I found that the stirrups were so very\r\n\"safe\" that they would not stay in at all. First one went off at one\r\njump, and then the other at another jump--with a fall for me on each\r\noccasion. I hated to give up the fun so early, and accordingly finished\r\nthe run without any stirrups. My horse never went as fast as on that\r\nrun. Doubtless a first-class horseman can ride as well without stirrups\r\nas with them. But I was not a first-class horseman. When anything\r\nunexpected happened, I was apt to clasp the solemn buggy horse firmly\r\nwith my spurred heels, and the result was that he laid himself out to do\r\nhis best in the way of galloping. He speedily found that, thanks to the\r\nsnaffle bit, I could not pull him in, so when we came to a down grade he\r\nwould usually put on steam. Then if there was a fence at the bottom and\r\nhe checked at all, I was apt to shoot forward, and in such event we went\r\nover the fence in a way that reminded me of Leech's picture, in _Punch_,\r\nof Mr. Tom Noddy and his mare jumping a fence in the following order:\r\nMr. Tom Noddy, I; his mare, II. However, I got in at the death this time\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nI was fond of walking and climbing. As a lad I used to go to the north\r\nwoods, in Maine, both in fall and winter. There I made life friends\r\nof two men, Will Dow and Bill Sewall: I canoed with them, and tramped\r\nthrough the woods with them, visiting the winter logging camps on\r\nsnow-shoes. Afterward they were with me in the West. Will Dow is dead.\r\nBill Sewall was collector of customs under me, on the Aroostook border.\r\nExcept when hunting I never did any mountaineering save for a couple of\r\nconventional trips up the Matterhorn and the Jungfrau on one occasion\r\nwhen I was in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nI never did much with the shotgun, but I practiced a good deal with the\r\nrifle. I had a rifle-range at Sagamore Hill, where I often took friends\r\nto shoot. Once or twice when I was visited by parties of released Boer\r\nprisoners, after the close of the South African War, they and I held\r\nshooting matches together. The best man with both pistol and rifle who\r\never shot there was Stewart Edward White. Among the many other good\r\nmen was a stanch friend, Baron Speck von Sternberg, afterwards German\r\nAmbassador at Washington during my Presidency. He was a capital shot,\r\nrider, and walker, a devoted and most efficient servant of Germany, who\r\nhad fought with distinction in the Franco-German War when barely more\r\nthan a boy; he was the hero of the story of \"the pig dog\" in Archibald\r\nForbes's volume of reminiscences. It was he who first talked over with\r\nme the raising of a regiment of horse riflemen from among the ranchmen\r\nand cowboys of the plains. When Ambassador, the poor, gallant,\r\ntender-hearted fellow was dying of a slow and painful disease, so that\r\nhe could not play with the rest of us, but the agony of his mortal\r\nillness never in the slightest degree interfered with his work.\r\nAmong the other men who shot and rode and walked with me was Cecil\r\nSpring-Rice, who has just been appointed British Ambassador to the\r\nUnited States. He was my groomsman, my best man, when I was married--at\r\nSt. George's, Hanover Square, which made me feel as if I were living in\r\none of Thackeray's novels.\r\n\r\nMy own experience as regards marksmanship was much the same as my\r\nexperience as regards horsemanship. There are men whose eye and hand are\r\nso quick and so sure that they achieve a perfection of marksmanship to\r\nwhich no practice will enable ordinary men to attain. There are other\r\nmen who cannot learn to shoot with any accuracy at all. In between come\r\nthe mass of men of ordinary abilities who, if they choose resolutely to\r\npractice, can by sheer industry and judgment make themselves fair rifle\r\nshots. The men who show this requisite industry and judgment can without\r\nspecial difficulty raise themselves to the second class of respectable\r\nrifle shots; and it is to this class that I belong. But to have reached\r\nthis point of marksmanship with the rifle at a target by no means\r\nimplies ability to hit game in the field, especially dangerous game. All\r\nkinds of other qualities, moral and physical, enter into being a good\r\nhunter, and especially a good hunter after dangerous game, just as all\r\nkinds of other qualities in addition to skill with the rifle enter\r\ninto being a good soldier. With dangerous game, after a fair degree of\r\nefficiency with the rifle has been attained, the prime requisites are\r\ncool judgment and that kind of nerve which consists in avoiding being\r\nrattled. Any beginner is apt to have \"buck fever,\" and therefore no\r\nbeginner should go at dangerous game.\r\n\r\nBuck fever means a state of intense nervous excitement which may be\r\nentirely divorced from timidity. It may affect a man the first time he\r\nhas to speak to a large audience just as it affects him the first time\r\nhe sees a buck or goes into battle. What such a man needs is not courage\r\nbut nerve control, cool-headedness. This he can get only by actual\r\npractice. He must, by custom and repeated exercise of self-mastery, get\r\nhis nerves thoroughly under control. This is largely a matter of habit,\r\nin the sense of repeated effort and repeated exercise of will power. If\r\nthe man has the right stuff in him, his will grows stronger and stronger\r\nwith each exercise of it--and if he has not the right stuff in him he\r\nhad better keep clear of dangerous game hunting, or indeed of any other\r\nform of sport or work in which there is bodily peril.\r\n\r\nAfter he has achieved the ability to exercise wariness and judgment and\r\nthe control over his nerves _which will make him shoot as well at the\r\ngame as at a target_, he can begin his essays at dangerous game hunting,\r\nand he will then find that it does not demand such abnormal prowess as\r\nthe outsider is apt to imagine. A man who can hit a soda-water bottle at\r\nthe distance of a few yards can brain a lion or a bear or an elephant at\r\nthat distance, and if he cannot brain it when it charges he can at least\r\nbring it to a standstill. All he has to do is to shoot as accurately as\r\nhe would at a soda-water bottle; and to do this requires nerve, at least\r\nas much as it does physical address. Having reached this point, the\r\nhunter must not imagine that he is warranted in taking desperate\r\nchances. There are degrees in proficiency; and what is a warrantable and\r\nlegitimate risk for a man to take when he has reached a certain grade of\r\nefficiency may be a foolish risk for him to take before he has reached\r\nthat grade. A man who has reached the degree of proficiency indicated\r\nabove is quite warranted in walking in at a lion at bay, in an open\r\nplain, to, say, within a hundred yards. If the lion has not charged, the\r\nman ought at that distance to knock him over and prevent his charging;\r\nand if the lion is already charging, the man ought at that distance to\r\nbe able to stop him. But the amount of prowess which warrants a man\r\nin relying on his ability to perform this feat does not by any means\r\njustify him in thinking that, for instance, he can crawl after a wounded\r\nlion into thick cover. I have known men of indifferent prowess to\r\nperform this latter feat successfully, but at least as often they have\r\nbeen unsuccessful, and in these cases the result has been unpleasant.\r\nThe man who habitually follows wounded lions into thick cover must be\r\na hunter of the highest skill, or he can count with certainty on an\r\nultimate mauling.\r\n\r\nThe first two or three bucks I ever saw gave me buck fever badly, but\r\nafter I had gained experience with ordinary game I never had buck fever\r\nat all with dangerous game. In my case the overcoming of buck fever\r\nwas the result of conscious effort and a deliberate determination\r\nto overcome it. More happily constituted men never have to make this\r\ndetermined effort at all--which may perhaps show that the average\r\nman can profit more from my experiences than he can from those of the\r\nexceptional man.\r\n\r\nI have shot only five kinds of animals which can fairly be called\r\ndangerous game--that is, the lion, elephant, rhinoceros, and buffalo\r\nin Africa, and the big grizzly bear a quarter of a century ago in the\r\nRockies. Taking into account not only my own personal experience, but\r\nthe experiences of many veteran hunters, I regard all the four African\r\nanimals, but especially the lion, elephant, and buffalo, as much more\r\ndangerous than the grizzly. As it happened, however, the only narrow\r\nescape I personally ever had was from a grizzly, and in Africa the\r\nanimal killed closest to me as it was charging was a rhinoceros--all of\r\nwhich goes to show that a man must not generalize too broadly from\r\nhis own personal experiences. On the whole, I think the lion the most\r\ndangerous of all these five animals; that is, I think that, if fairly\r\nhunted, there is a larger percentage of hunters killed or mauled for a\r\ngiven number of lions killed than for a given number of any one of the\r\nother animals. Yet I personally had no difficulties with lions. I twice\r\nkilled lions which were at bay and just starting to charge, and I killed\r\na heavy-maned male while it was in full charge. But in each instance I\r\nhad plenty of leeway, the animal being so far off that even if my bullet\r\nhad not been fatal I should have had time for a couple more shots. The\r\nAfrican buffalo is undoubtedly a dangerous beast, but it happened that\r\nthe few that I shot did not charge. A bull elephant, a vicious \"rogue,\"\r\nwhich had been killing people in the native villages, did charge before\r\nbeing shot at. My son Kermit and I stopped it at forty yards. Another\r\nbull elephant, also unwounded, which charged, nearly got me, as I\r\nhad just fired both cartridges from my heavy double-barreled rifle in\r\nkilling the bull I was after--the first wild elephant I had ever seen.\r\nThe second bull came through the thick brush to my left like a steam\r\nplow through a light snowdrift, everything snapping before his rush, and\r\nwas so near that he could have hit me with his trunk. I slipped past\r\nhim behind a tree. People have asked me how I felt on this occasion.\r\nMy answer has always been that I suppose I felt as most men of like\r\nexperience feel on such occasions. At such a moment a hunter is so\r\nvery busy that he has no time to get frightened. He wants to get in his\r\ncartridges and try another shot.\r\n\r\nRhinoceros are truculent, blustering beasts, much the most stupid of\r\nall the dangerous game I know. Generally their attitude is one of mere\r\nstupidity and bluff. But on occasions they do charge wickedly, both when\r\nwounded and when entirely unprovoked. The first I ever shot I mortally\r\nwounded at a few rods' distance, and it charged with the utmost\r\ndetermination, whereat I and my companion both fired, and more by good\r\nluck than anything else brought it to the ground just thirteen paces\r\nfrom where we stood. Another rhinoceros may or may not have been meaning\r\nto charge me; I have never been certain which. It heard us and came at\r\nus through rather thick brush, snorting and tossing its head. I am by\r\nno means sure that it had fixedly hostile intentions, and indeed with\r\nmy present experience I think it likely that if I had not fired it would\r\nhave flinched at the last moment and either retreated or gone by me.\r\nBut I am not a rhinoceros mind reader, and its actions were such as to\r\nwarrant my regarding it as a suspicious character. I stopped it with a\r\ncouple of bullets, and then followed it up and killed it. The skins\r\nof all these animals which I thus killed are in the National Museum at\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nBut, as I said above, the only narrow escape I met with was not from\r\none of these dangerous African animals, but from a grizzly bear. It was\r\nabout twenty-four years ago. I had wounded the bear just at sunset, in a\r\nwood of lodge-pole pines, and, following him, I wounded him again, as he\r\nstood on the other side of a thicket. He then charged through the brush,\r\ncoming with such speed and with such an irregular gait that, try as I\r\nwould, I was not able to get the sight of my rifle on the brain-pan,\r\nthough I hit him very hard with both the remaining barrels of my\r\nmagazine Winchester. It was in the days of black powder, and the smoke\r\nhung. After my last shot, the first thing I saw was the bear's left paw\r\nas he struck at me, so close that I made a quick movement to one side.\r\nHe was, however, practically already dead, and after another jump, and\r\nwhile in the very act of trying to turn to come at me, he collapsed like\r\na shot rabbit.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I had a most exasperating time trying to bring in his skin.\r\nI was alone, traveling on foot with one very docile little mountain mare\r\nfor a pack pony. The little mare cared nothing for bears or anything\r\nelse, so there was no difficulty in packing her. But the man without\r\nexperience can hardly realize the work it was to get that bearskin off\r\nthe carcass and then to pack it, wet, slippery, and heavy, so that it\r\nwould ride evenly on the pony. I was at the time fairly well versed in\r\npacking with a \"diamond hitch,\" the standby of Rocky Mountain packers in\r\nmy day; but the diamond hitch is a two-man job; and even working with\r\na \"squaw hitch,\" I got into endless trouble with that wet and slippery\r\nbearskin. With infinite labor I would get the skin on the pony and run\r\nthe ropes over it until to all seeming it was fastened properly. Then\r\noff we would start, and after going about a hundred yards I would notice\r\nthe hide beginning to bulge through between two ropes. I would shift one\r\nof them, and then the hide would bulge somewhere else. I would shift the\r\nrope again; and still the hide would flow slowly out as if it was lava.\r\nThe first thing I knew it would come down on one side, and the little\r\nmare, with her feet planted resolutely, would wait for me to perform my\r\npart by getting that bearskin back in its proper place on the McClellan\r\nsaddle which I was using as a makeshift pack saddle. The feat of killing\r\nthe bear the previous day sank into nothing compared with the feat of\r\nmaking the bearskin ride properly as a pack on the following three days.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I was alone in the mountains on this occasion was\r\nbecause, for the only time in all my experience, I had a difficulty with\r\nmy guide. He was a crippled old mountain man, with a profound contempt\r\nfor \"tenderfeet,\" a contempt that in my case was accentuated by the\r\nfact that I wore spectacles--which at that day and in that region were\r\nusually held to indicate a defective moral character in the wearer. He\r\nhad never previously acted as guide, or, as he expressed it, \"trundled\r\na tenderfoot,\" and though a good hunter, who showed me much game, our\r\nexperience together was not happy. He was very rheumatic and liked to\r\nlie abed late, so that I usually had to get breakfast, and, in fact, do\r\nmost of the work around camp. Finally one day he declined to go out with\r\nme, saying that he had a pain. When, that afternoon, I got back to\r\ncamp, I speedily found what the \"pain\" was. We were traveling very light\r\nindeed, I having practically nothing but my buffalo sleeping-bag, my\r\nwash kit, and a pair of socks. I had also taken a flask of whisky for\r\nemergencies--although, as I found that the emergencies never arose\r\nand that tea was better than whisky when a man was cold or done out, I\r\nabandoned the practice of taking whisky on hunting trips twenty years\r\nago. When I got back to camp the old fellow was sitting on a tree-trunk,\r\nvery erect, with his rifle across his knees, and in response to my nod\r\nof greeting he merely leered at me. I leaned my rifle against a tree,\r\nwalked over to where my bed was lying, and, happening to rummage in it\r\nfor something, I found the whisky flask was empty. I turned on him at\r\nonce and accused him of having drunk it, to which he merely responded by\r\nasking what I was going to do about it. There did not seem much to do,\r\nso I said that we would part company--we were only four or five days\r\nfrom a settlement--and I would go in alone, taking one of the horses. He\r\nresponded by cocking his rifle and saying that I could go alone and be\r\ndamned to me, but I could not take any horse. I answered \"all right,\"\r\nthat if I could not I could not, and began to move around to get some\r\nflour and salt pork. He was misled by my quietness and by the fact that\r\nI had not in any way resented either his actions or his language during\r\nthe days we had been together, and did not watch me as closely as he\r\nought to have done. He was sitting with the cocked rifle across his\r\nknees, the muzzle to the left. My rifle was leaning against a tree near\r\nthe cooking things to his right. Managing to get near it, I whipped it\r\nup and threw the bead on him, calling, \"Hands up!\" He of course put\r\nup his hands, and then said, \"Oh, come, I was only joking\"; to which I\r\nanswered, \"Well, I am not. Now straighten your legs and let your rifle\r\ngo to the ground.\" He remonstrated, saying the rifle would go off, and\r\nI told him to let it go off. However, he straightened his legs in such\r\nfashion that it came to the ground without a jar. I then made him move\r\nback, and picked up the rifle. By this time he was quite sober, and\r\nreally did not seem angry, looking at me quizzically. He told me that if\r\nI would give him back his rifle, he would call it quits and we could go\r\non together. I did not think it best to trust him, so I told him that\r\nour hunt was pretty well through, anyway, and that I would go home.\r\nThere was a blasted pine on the trail, in plain view of the camp, about\r\na mile off, and I told him that I would leave his rifle at that blasted\r\npine if I could see him in camp, but that he must not come after me,\r\nfor if he did I should assume that it was with hostile intent and would\r\nshoot. He said he had no intention of coming after me; and as he was\r\nvery much crippled with rheumatism, I did not believe he would do so.\r\n\r\nAccordingly I took the little mare, with nothing but some flour, bacon,\r\nand tea, and my bed-roll, and started off. At the blasted pine I looked\r\nround, and as I could see him in camp, I left his rifle there. I then\r\ntraveled till dark, and that night, for the only time in my experience,\r\nI used in camping a trick of the old-time trappers in the Indian days. I\r\ndid not believe I would be followed, but still it was not possible to be\r\nsure, so, after getting supper, while my pony fed round, I left the fire\r\nburning, repacked the mare and pushed ahead until it literally became so\r\ndark that I could not see. Then I picketed the mare, slept where I was\r\nwithout a fire until the first streak of dawn, and then pushed on for a\r\ncouple of hours before halting to take breakfast and to let the little\r\nmare have a good feed. No plainsman needs to be told that a man should\r\nnot lie near a fire if there is danger of an enemy creeping up on him,\r\nand that above all a man should not put himself in a position where he\r\ncan be ambushed at dawn. On this second day I lost the trail, and toward\r\nnightfall gave up the effort to find it, camped where I was, and went\r\nout to shoot a grouse for supper. It was while hunting in vain for a\r\ngrouse that I came on the bear and killed it as above described.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the settlement and went into the store, the storekeeper\r\nidentified me by remarking: \"You're the tenderfoot that old Hank was\r\ntrundling, ain't you?\" I admitted that I was. A good many years later,\r\nafter I had been elected Vice-President, I went on a cougar hunt in\r\nnorthwestern Colorado with Johnny Goff, a famous hunter and mountain\r\nman. It was midwinter. I was rather proud of my achievements, and\r\npictured myself as being known to the few settlers in the neighborhood\r\nas a successful mountain-lion hunter. I could not help grinning\r\nwhen I found out that they did not even allude to me as the\r\nVice-President-elect, let alone as a hunter, but merely as \"Johnny\r\nGoff's tourist.\"\r\n\r\nOf course during the years when I was most busy at serious work I could\r\ndo no hunting, and even my riding was of a decorous kind. But a man\r\nwhose business is sedentary should get some kind of exercise if he\r\nwishes to keep himself in as good physical trim as his brethren who do\r\nmanual labor. When I worked on a ranch, I needed no form of exercise\r\nexcept my work, but when I worked in an office the case was different.\r\nA couple of summers I played polo with some of my neighbors. I shall\r\nalways believe we played polo in just the right way for middle-aged men\r\nwith stables of the general utility order. Of course it was polo which\r\nwas chiefly of interest to ourselves, the only onlookers being the\r\nmembers of our faithful families. My two ponies were the only occupants\r\nof my stable except a cart-horse. My wife and I rode and drove them, and\r\nthey were used for household errands and for the children, and for two\r\nafternoons a week they served me as polo ponies. Polo is a good game,\r\ninfinitely better for vigorous men than tennis or golf or anything of\r\nthat kind. There is all the fun of football, with the horse thrown in;\r\nand if only people would be willing to play it in simple fashion it\r\nwould be almost as much within their reach as golf. But at Oyster Bay\r\nour great and permanent amusements were rowing and sailing; I do not\r\ncare for the latter, and am fond of the former. I suppose it sounds\r\narchaic, but I cannot help thinking that the people with motor boats\r\nmiss a great deal. If they would only keep to rowboats or canoes, and\r\nuse oar or paddle themselves, they would get infinitely more benefit\r\nthan by having their work done for them by gasoline. But I rarely took\r\nexercise merely as exercise. Primarily I took it because I liked it.\r\nPlay should never be allowed to interfere with work; and a life devoted\r\nmerely to play is, of all forms of existence, the most dismal. But the\r\njoy of life is a very good thing, and while work is the essential in it,\r\nplay also has its place.\r\n\r\nWhen obliged to live in cities, I for a long time found that boxing and\r\nwrestling enabled me to get a good deal of exercise in condensed and\r\nattractive form. I was reluctantly obliged to abandon both as I grew\r\nolder. I dropped the wrestling earliest. When I became Governor, the\r\nchampion middleweight wrestler of America happened to be in Albany, and\r\nI got him to come round three or four afternoons a week. Incidentally\r\nI may mention that his presence caused me a difficulty with the\r\nComptroller, who refused to audit a bill I put in for a wrestling-mat,\r\nexplaining that I could have a billiard-table, billiards being\r\nrecognized as a proper Gubernatorial amusement, but that a wrestling-mat\r\nsymbolized something unusual and unheard of and could not be permitted.\r\nThe middleweight champion was of course so much better than I was that\r\nhe could not only take care of himself but of me too and see that I was\r\nnot hurt--for wrestling is a much more violent amusement than boxing.\r\nBut after a couple of months he had to go away, and he left as a\r\nsubstitute a good-humored, stalwart professional oarsman. The oarsman\r\nturned out to know very little about wrestling. He could not even take\r\ncare of himself, not to speak of me. By the end of our second afternoon\r\none of his long ribs had been caved in and two of my short ribs badly\r\ndamaged, and my left shoulder-blade so nearly shoved out of place that\r\nit creaked. He was nearly as pleased as I was when I told him I thought\r\nwe would \"vote the war a failure\" and abandon wrestling. After that I\r\ntook up boxing again. While President I used to box with some of the\r\naides, as well as play single-stick with General Wood. After a few years\r\nI had to abandon boxing as well as wrestling, for in one bout a young\r\ncaptain of artillery cross-countered me on the eye, and the blow smashed\r\nthe little blood-vessels. Fortunately it was my left eye, but the sight\r\nhas been dim ever since, and if it had been the right eye I should\r\nhave been entirely unable to shoot. Accordingly I thought it better\r\nto acknowledge that I had become an elderly man and would have to stop\r\nboxing. I then took up jiu-jitsu for a year or two.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in the Legislature and was working very hard, with little\r\nchance of getting out of doors, all the exercise I got was boxing and\r\nwrestling. A young fellow turned up who was a second-rate prize-fighter,\r\nthe son of one of my old boxing teachers. For several weeks I had him\r\ncome round to my rooms in the morning to put on the gloves with me for\r\nhalf an hour. Then he suddenly stopped, and some days later I received a\r\nletter of woe from him from the jail. I found that he was by profession\r\na burglar, and merely followed boxing as the amusement of his lighter\r\nmoments, or when business was slack.\r\n\r\nNaturally, being fond of boxing, I grew to know a good many\r\nprize-fighters, and to most of those I knew I grew genuinely attached.\r\nI have never been able to sympathize with the outcry against\r\nprize-fighters. The only objection I have to the prize ring is the\r\ncrookedness that has attended its commercial development. Outside of\r\nthis I regard boxing, whether professional or amateur, as a first-class\r\nsport, and I do not regard it as brutalizing. Of course matches can be\r\nconducted under conditions that make them brutalizing. But this is true\r\nof football games and of most other rough and vigorous sports. Most\r\ncertainly prize-fighting is not half as brutalizing or demoralizing\r\nas many forms of big business and of the legal work carried on in\r\nconnection with big business. Powerful, vigorous men of strong animal\r\ndevelopment must have some way in which their animal spirits can find\r\nvent. When I was Police Commissioner I found (and Jacob Riis will\r\nback me up in this) that the establishment of a boxing club in a tough\r\nneighborhood always tended to do away with knifing and gun-fighting\r\namong the young fellows who would otherwise have been in murderous\r\ngangs. Many of these young fellows were not naturally criminals at all,\r\nbut they had to have some outlet for their activities. In the same way\r\nI have always regarded boxing as a first-class sport to encourage in the\r\nYoung Men's Christian Association. I do not like to see young Christians\r\nwith shoulders that slope like a champagne bottle. Of course boxing\r\nshould be encouraged in the army and navy. I was first drawn to two\r\nnaval chaplains, Fathers Chidwick and Rainey, by finding that each of\r\nthem had bought half a dozen sets of boxing-gloves and encouraged their\r\ncrews in boxing.\r\n\r\nWhen I was Police Commissioner, I heartily approved the effort to\r\nget boxing clubs started in New York on a clean basis. Later I was\r\nreluctantly obliged to come to the conclusion that the prize ring had\r\nbecome hopelessly debased and demoralized, and as Governor I aided in\r\nthe passage of and signed the bill putting a stop to professional boxing\r\nfor money. This was because some of the prize-fighters themselves were\r\ncrooked, while the crowd of hangers-on who attended and made up and\r\nprofited by the matches had placed the whole business on a basis\r\nof commercialism and brutality that was intolerable. I shall always\r\nmaintain that boxing contests themselves make good, healthy sport. It\r\nis idle to compare them with bull-fighting; the torture and death of the\r\nwretched horses in bull-fighting is enough of itself to blast the sport,\r\nno matter how great the skill and prowess shown by the bull-fighters.\r\nAny sport in which the death and torture of animals is made to furnish\r\npleasure to the spectators is debasing. There should always be the\r\nopportunity provided in a glove fight or bare-fist fight to stop it when\r\none competitor is hopelessly outclassed or too badly hammered. But the\r\nmen who take part in these fights are hard as nails, and it is not worth\r\nwhile to feel sentimental about their receiving punishment which as a\r\nmatter of fact they do not mind. Of course the men who look on ought to\r\nbe able to stand up with the gloves, or without them, themselves; I have\r\nscant use for the type of sportsmanship which consists merely in looking\r\non at the feats of some one else.\r\n\r\nSome as good citizens as I know are or were prize-fighters. Take Mike\r\nDonovan, of New York. He and his family represent a type of American\r\ncitizenship of which we have a right to be proud. Mike is a devoted\r\ntemperance man, and can be relied upon for every movement in the\r\ninterest of good citizenship. I was first intimately thrown with him\r\nwhen I was Police Commissioner. One evening he and I--both in dress\r\nsuits--attended a temperance meeting of Catholic societies. It\r\nculminated in a lively set-to between myself and a Tammany Senator who\r\nwas a very good fellow, but whose ideas of temperance differed radically\r\nfrom mine, and, as the event proved, from those of the majority of the\r\nmeeting. Mike evidently regarded himself as my backer--he was sitting on\r\nthe platform beside me--and I think felt as pleased and interested as if\r\nthe set-to had been physical instead of merely verbal. Afterward I grew\r\nto know him well both while I was Governor and while I was President,\r\nand many a time he came on and boxed with me.\r\n\r\nBattling Nelson was another stanch friend, and he and I think alike\r\non most questions of political and industrial life; although he once\r\nexpressed to me some commiseration because, as President, I did not get\r\nanything like the money return for my services that he aggregated during\r\nthe same term of years in the ring. Bob Fitzsimmons was another good\r\nfriend of mine. He has never forgotten his early skill as a blacksmith,\r\nand among the things that I value and always keep in use is a penholder\r\nmade by Bob out of a horseshoe, with an inscription saying that it is\r\n\"Made for and presented to President Theodore Roosevelt by his friend\r\nand admirer, Robert Fitzsimmons.\" I have for a long time had the\r\nfriendship of John L. Sullivan, than whom in his prime no better man\r\never stepped into the ring. He is now a Massachusetts farmer. John used\r\noccasionally to visit me at the White House, his advent always causing a\r\ndistinct flutter among the waiting Senators and Congressmen. When I went\r\nto Africa he presented me with a gold-mounted rabbit's foot for luck. I\r\ncarried it through my African trip; and I certainly had good luck.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion one of my prize-fighting friends called on me at the\r\nWhite House on business. He explained that he wished to see me alone,\r\nsat down opposite me, and put a very expensive cigar on the desk,\r\nsaying, \"Have a cigar.\" I thanked him and said I did not smoke, to which\r\nhe responded, \"Put it in your pocket.\" He then added, \"Take another; put\r\nboth in your pocket.\" This I accordingly did. Having thus shown at the\r\noutset the necessary formal courtesy, my visitor, an old and valued\r\nfriend, proceeded to explain that a nephew of his had enlisted in the\r\nMarine Corps, but had been absent without leave, and was threatened with\r\ndishonorable discharge on the ground of desertion. My visitor, a good\r\ncitizen and a patriotic American, was stung to the quick at the thought\r\nof such an incident occurring in his family, and he explained to me that\r\nit must not occur, that there must not be the disgrace to the family,\r\nalthough he would be delighted to have the offender \"handled rough\" to\r\nteach him a needed lesson; he added that he wished I would take him and\r\nhandle him myself, for he knew that I would see that he \"got all that\r\nwas coming to him.\" Then a look of pathos came into his eyes, and\r\nhe explained: \"That boy I just cannot understand. He was my sister's\r\nfavorite son, and I always took a special interest in him myself. I\r\ndid my best to bring him up the way he ought to go. But there was just\r\nnothing to be done with him. His tastes were naturally low. He took\r\nto music!\" What form this debasing taste for music assumed I did not\r\ninquire; and I was able to grant my friend's wish.\r\n\r\nWhile in the White House I always tried to get a couple of hours'\r\nexercise in the afternoons--sometimes tennis, more often riding, or else\r\na rough cross-country walk, perhaps down Rock Creek, which was then as\r\nwild as a stream in the White Mountains, or on the Virginia side along\r\nthe Potomac. My companions at tennis or on these rides and walks we\r\ngradually grew to style the Tennis Cabinet; and then we extended the\r\nterm to take in many of my old-time Western friends such as Ben Daniels,\r\nSeth Bullock, Luther Kelly, and others who had taken part with me in\r\nmore serious outdoor adventures than walking and riding for pleasure.\r\nMost of the men who were oftenest with me on these trips--men like\r\nMajor-General Leonard Wood; or Major-General Thomas Henry Barry; or\r\nPresley Marion Rixey, Surgeon-General of the Navy; or Robert Bacon, who\r\nwas afterwards Secretary of State; or James Garfield, who was Secretary\r\nof the Interior; or Gifford Pinchot, who was chief of the Forest\r\nService--were better men physically than I was; but I could ride and\r\nwalk well enough for us all thoroughly to enjoy it. Often, especially\r\nin the winters and early springs, we would arrange for a point to point\r\nwalk, not turning aside for anything--for instance, swimming Rock\r\nCreek or even the Potomac if it came in our way. Of course under such\r\ncircumstances we had to arrange that our return to Washington should\r\nbe when it was dark, so that our appearance might scandalize no one. On\r\nseveral occasions we thus swam Rock Creek in the early spring when the\r\nice was floating thick upon it. If we swam the Potomac, we usually\r\ntook off our clothes. I remember one such occasion when the French\r\nAmbassador, Jusserand, who was a member of the Tennis Cabinet, was\r\nalong, and, just as we were about to get in to swim, somebody said, \"Mr.\r\nAmbassador, Mr. Ambassador, you haven't taken off your gloves,\" to which\r\nhe promptly responded, \"I think I will leave them on; we might meet\r\nladies!\"\r\n\r\nWe liked Rock Creek for these walks because we could do so much\r\nscrambling and climbing along the cliffs; there was almost as much\r\nclimbing when we walked down the Potomac to Washington from the Virginia\r\nend of the Chain Bridge. I would occasionally take some big-game friend\r\nfrom abroad, Selous or St. George Littledale or Captain Radclyffe\r\nor Paul Niedicke, on these walks. Once I invited an entire class of\r\nofficers who were attending lectures at the War College to come on one\r\nof these walks; I chose a route which gave us the hardest climbing along\r\nthe rocks and the deepest crossings of the creek; and my army friends\r\nenjoyed it hugely--being the right sort, to a man.\r\n\r\nOn March 1, 1909, three days before leaving the Presidency, various\r\nmembers of the Tennis Cabinet lunched with me at the White House.\r\n\"Tennis Cabinet\" was an elastic term, and of course many who ought\r\nto have been at the lunch were, for one reason or another, away from\r\nWashington; but, to make up for this, a goodly number of out-of-town\r\nhonorary members, so to speak, were present--for instance, Seth Bullock;\r\nLuther Kelly, better known as Yellowstone Kelly in the days when he was\r\nan army scout against the Sioux; and Abernathy, the wolf-hunter. At the\r\nend of the lunch Seth Bullock suddenly reached forward, swept aside a\r\nmass of flowers which made a centerpiece on the table, and revealed\r\na bronze cougar by Proctor, which was a parting gift to me. The lunch\r\nparty and the cougar were then photographed on the lawn.\r\n\r\nSome of the younger officers who were my constant companions on these\r\nwalks and rides pointed out to me the condition of utter physical\r\nworthlessness into which certain of the elder ones had permitted\r\nthemselves to lapse, and the very bad effect this would certainly have\r\nif ever the army were called into service. I then looked into the matter\r\nfor myself, and was really shocked at what I found. Many of the older\r\nofficers were so unfit physically that their condition would have\r\nexcited laughter, had it not been so serious, to think that they\r\nbelonged to the military arm of the Government. A cavalry colonel proved\r\nunable to keep his horse at a smart trot for even half a mile, when I\r\nvisited his post; a Major-General proved afraid even to let his horse\r\ncanter, when he went on a ride with us; and certain otherwise good\r\nmen proved as unable to walk as if they had been sedentary brokers.\r\nI consulted with men like Major-Generals Wood and Bell, who were\r\nthemselves of fine physique, with bodies fit to meet any demand. It\r\nwas late in my administration; and we deemed it best only to make a\r\nbeginning--experience teaches the most inveterate reformer how hard it\r\nis to get a totally non-military nation to accept seriously any military\r\nimprovement. Accordingly, I merely issued directions that each officer\r\nshould prove his ability to walk fifty miles, or ride one hundred, in\r\nthree days.\r\n\r\nThis is, of course, a test which many a healthy middle-aged woman would\r\nbe able to meet. But a large portion of the press adopted the view that\r\nit was a bit of capricious tyranny on my part; and a considerable number\r\nof elderly officers, with desk rather than field experience, intrigued\r\nwith their friends in Congress to have the order annulled. So one day I\r\ntook a ride of a little over one hundred miles myself, in company with\r\nSurgeon-General Rixey and two other officers. The Virginia roads were\r\nfrozen and in ruts, and in the afternoon and evening there was a storm\r\nof snow and sleet; and when it had been thus experimentally shown, under\r\nunfavorable conditions, how easy it was to do in one day the task for\r\nwhich the army officers were allowed three days, all open objection\r\nceased. But some bureau chiefs still did as much underhanded work\r\nagainst the order as they dared, and it was often difficult to reach\r\nthem. In the Marine Corps Captain Leonard, who had lost an arm at\r\nTientsin, with two of his lieutenants did the fifty miles in one day;\r\nfor they were vigorous young men, who laughed at the idea of treating a\r\nfifty-mile walk as over-fatiguing. Well, the Navy Department officials\r\nrebuked them, and made them take the walk over again in three days,\r\non the ground that taking it in one day did not comply with the\r\nregulations! This seems unbelievable; but Leonard assures me it is true.\r\nHe did not inform me at the time, being afraid to \"get in wrong\" with\r\nhis permanent superiors. If I had known of the order, short work would\r\nhave been made of the bureaucrat who issued it.[*]\r\n\r\n     [*] One of our best naval officers sent me the following\r\n     letter, after the above had appeared:--\r\n\r\n     \"I note in your Autobiography now being published in the\r\n     Outlook that you refer to the reasons which led you to\r\n     establish a physical test for the Army, and to the action\r\n     you took (your 100-mile ride) to prevent the test being\r\n     abolished. Doubtless you did not know the following facts:\r\n\r\n     \"1. The first annual navy test of 50 miles in three days was\r\n     subsequently reduced to 25 miles in two days in each\r\n     quarter.\r\n\r\n     \"2. This was further reduced to 10 miles each month, which\r\n     is the present 'test,' and there is danger lest even this\r\n     utterly insufficient test be abolished.\r\n\r\n     \"I enclose a copy of a recent letter to the Surgeon General\r\n     which will show our present deplorable condition and the\r\n     worse condition into which we are slipping back.\r\n\r\n     \"The original test of 50 miles in three days did a very\r\n     great deal of good. It decreased by thousands of dollars the\r\n     money expended on street car fare, and by a much greater sum\r\n     the amount expended over the bar. It eliminated a number of\r\n     the wholly unfit; it taught officers to walk; it forced them\r\n     to learn the care of their feet and that of their men; and\r\n     it improved their general health and was rapidly forming a\r\n     taste for physical exercise.\"\r\n\r\n     The enclosed letter ran in part as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"I am returning under separate cover 'The Soldiers' Foot and\r\n     the Military Shoe.'\r\n\r\n     \"The book contains knowledge of a practical character that\r\n     is valuable for the men who HAVE TO MARCH, WHO HAVE SUFFERED\r\n     FROM FOOT TROUBLES, AND WHO MUST AVOID THEM IN ORDER TO\r\n     ATTAIN EFFICIENCY.\r\n\r\n     \"The words in capitals express, according to my idea, the\r\n     gist of the whole matter as regards military men.\r\n\r\n     \"The army officer whose men break down on test gets a black\r\n     eye. The one whose men show efficiency in this respect gets\r\n     a bouquet.\r\n\r\n     \"To such men the book is invaluable. There is no danger that\r\n     they will neglect it. They will actually learn it, for\r\n     exactly the same reasons that our fellows learn the gunnery\r\n     instructions--or did learn them before they were withdrawn\r\n     and burned.\r\n\r\n     \"B U T, I have not been able to interest a single naval\r\n     officer in this fine book. They will look at the pictures\r\n     and say it is a good book, but they won't read it. The\r\n     marine officers, on the contrary, are very much interested,\r\n     because they have to teach their men to care for their feet\r\n     and they must know how to care for their own. But the naval\r\n     officers feel no such necessity, simply because their men do\r\n     not have to demonstrate their efficiency by practice\r\n     marches, and they themselves do not have to do a stunt that\r\n     will show up their own ignorance and inefficiency in the\r\n     matter.\r\n\r\n     \"For example, some time ago I was talking with some chaps\r\n     about shoes--the necessity of having them long enough and\r\n     wide enough, etc., and one of them said: 'I have no use for\r\n     such shoes, as I never walk except when I have to, and any\r\n     old shoes do for the 10-mile-a-month stunt,' so there you\r\n     are!\r\n\r\n     \"When the first test was ordered, Edmonston (Washington shoe\r\n     man) told me that he sold more real walking shoes to naval\r\n     officers in three months than he had in the three preceding\r\n     years. I know three officers who lost both big-toe nails\r\n     after the first test, and another who walked nine miles in\r\n     practice with a pair of heavy walking shoes that were too\r\n     small and was laid up for three days--could not come to the\r\n     office. I know plenty of men who after the first test had to\r\n     borrow shoes from larger men until their feet 'went down' to\r\n     their normal size.\r\n\r\n     \"This test may have been a bit too strenuous for old hearts\r\n     (of men who had never taken any exercise), but it was\r\n     excellent as a matter of instruction and training of\r\n     handling feet--and in an emergency (such as we soon may have\r\n     in Mexico) sound hearts are not much good if the feet won't\r\n     stand.\r\n\r\n     \"However, the 25-mile test in two days each quarter answered\r\n     the same purpose, for the reason that 12.5 miles will\r\n     produce sore feet with bad shoes, and sore feet and lame\r\n     muscles even with good shoes, if there has been no practice\r\n     marching.\r\n\r\n     \"It was the necessity of doing 12.5 MORE MILES ON THE SECOND\r\n     DAY WITH SORE FEET AND LAME MUSCLES that made 'em sit up and\r\n     take notice--made 'em practice walking, made 'em avoid\r\n     street cars, buy proper shoes, show some curiosity about sox\r\n     and the care of the feet in general.\r\n\r\n     \"All this passed out with the introduction of the last test\r\n     of 10 miles a month. As one fellow said: 'I can do that in\r\n     sneakers'--but he couldn't if the second day involved a\r\n     tramp on the sore feet.\r\n\r\n     \"The point is that whereas formerly officers had to practice\r\n     walking a bit and give some attention to proper footgear,\r\n     now they don't have to, and the natural consequence is that\r\n     they don't do it.\r\n\r\n     \"There are plenty of officers who do not walk any more than\r\n     is necessary to reach a street car that will carry them from\r\n     their residences to their offices. Some who have motors do\r\n     not do so much. They take no exercise. They take cocktails\r\n     instead and are getting beefy and 'ponchy,' and something\r\n     should be done to remedy this state of affairs.\r\n\r\n     \"It would not be necessary if service opinion required\r\n     officers so to order their lives that it would be common\r\n     knowledge that they were 'hard,' in order to avoid the\r\n     danger of being selected out.\r\n\r\n     \"We have no such service opinion, and it is not in process\r\n     of formation. On the contrary, it is known that the\r\n     'Principal Dignitaries' unanimously advised the Secretary to\r\n     abandon all physical tests. He, a civilian, was wise enough\r\n     not to take the advice.\r\n\r\n     \"I would like to see a test established that would oblige\r\n     officers to take sufficient exercise to pass it without\r\n     inconvenience. For the reasons given above, 20 miles in two\r\n     days every other month would do the business, while 10 miles\r\n     each month does not touch it, simply because nobody has to\r\n     walk on 'next day' feet. As for the proposed test of so many\r\n     hours 'exercise' a week, the flat foots of the pendulous\r\n     belly muscles are delighted. They are looking into the\r\n     question of pedometers, and will hang one of these on their\r\n     wheezy chests and let it count every shuffling step they\r\n     take out of doors.\r\n\r\n     \"If we had an adequate test throughout 20 years, there would\r\n     at the end of that time be few if any sacks of blubber at\r\n     the upper end of the list; and service opinion against that\r\n     sort of thing would be established.\"\r\n\r\nThese tests were kept during my administration. They were afterwards\r\nabandoned; not through perversity or viciousness; but through weakness,\r\nand inability to understand the need of preparedness in advance, if the\r\nemergencies of war are to be properly met, when, or if, they arrive.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no country with an army worth calling such is there a chance for\r\na man physically unfit to stay in the service. Our countrymen should\r\nunderstand that every army officer--and every marine officer--ought to\r\nbe summarily removed from the service unless he is able to undergo far\r\nseverer tests than those which, as a beginning, I imposed. To follow any\r\nother course is to put a premium on slothful incapacity, and to do the\r\ngravest wrong to the Nation.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned all these experiences, and I could mention scores of\r\nothers, because out of them grew my philosophy--perhaps they were in\r\npart caused by my philosophy--of bodily vigor as a method of getting\r\nthat vigor of soul without which vigor of the body counts for nothing.\r\nThe dweller in cities has less chance than the dweller in the country to\r\nkeep his body sound and vigorous. But he can do so, if only he will take\r\nthe trouble. Any young lawyer, shopkeeper, or clerk, or shop-assistant\r\ncan keep himself in good condition if he tries. Some of the best men who\r\nhave ever served under me in the National Guard and in my regiment were\r\nformer clerks or floor-walkers. Why, Johnny Hayes, the Marathon victor,\r\nand at one time world champion, one of my valued friends and supporters,\r\nwas a floor-walker in Bloomingdale's big department store. Surely with\r\nJohnny Hayes as an example, any young man in a city can hope to make his\r\nbody all that a vigorous man's body should be.\r\n\r\nI once made a speech to which I gave the title \"The Strenuous Life.\"\r\nAfterwards I published a volume of essays with this for a title. There\r\nwere two translations of it which always especially pleased me. One was\r\nby a Japanese officer who knew English well, and who had carried the\r\nessay all through the Manchurian campaign, and later translated it for\r\nthe benefit of his countrymen. The other was by an Italian lady, whose\r\nbrother, an officer in the Italian army who had died on duty in a\r\nforeign land, had also greatly liked the article and carried it round\r\nwith him. In translating the title the lady rendered it in Italian as\r\n_Vigor di Vita_. I thought this translation a great improvement on the\r\noriginal, and have always wished that I had myself used \"The Vigor of\r\nLife\" as a heading to indicate what I was trying to preach, instead of\r\nthe heading I actually did use.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of success, or rather two kinds of ability displayed\r\nin the achievement of success. There is, first, the success either in\r\nbig things or small things which comes to the man who has in him the\r\nnatural power to do what no one else can do, and what no amount of\r\ntraining, no perseverance or will power, will enable any ordinary man to\r\ndo. This success, of course, like every other kind of success, may be\r\non a very big scale or on a small scale. The quality which the man\r\npossesses may be that which enables him to run a hundred yards in nine\r\nand three-fifths seconds, or to play ten separate games of chess at the\r\nsame time blindfolded, or to add five columns of figures at once without\r\neffort, or to write the \"Ode to a Grecian Urn,\" or to deliver the\r\nGettysburg speech, or to show the ability of Frederick at Leuthen or\r\nNelson at Trafalgar. No amount of training of body or mind would enable\r\nany good ordinary man to perform any one of these feats. Of course the\r\nproper performance of each implies much previous study or training,\r\nbut in no one of them is success to be attained save by the altogether\r\nexceptional man who has in him the something additional which the\r\nordinary man does not have.\r\n\r\nThis is the most striking kind of success, and it can be attained only\r\nby the man who has in him the quality which separates him in kind no\r\nless than in degree from his fellows. But much the commoner type of\r\nsuccess in every walk of life and in every species of effort is that\r\nwhich comes to the man who differs from his fellows not by the kind of\r\nquality which he possesses but by the degree of development which he has\r\ngiven that quality. This kind of success is open to a large number of\r\npersons, if only they seriously determine to achieve it. It is the kind\r\nof success which is open to the average man of sound body and fair mind,\r\nwho has no remarkable mental or physical attributes, but who gets just\r\nas much as possible in the way of work out of the aptitudes that he does\r\npossess. It is the only kind of success that is open to most of us. Yet\r\nsome of the greatest successes in history have been those of this second\r\nclass--when I call it second class I am not running it down in the\r\nleast, I am merely pointing out that it differs in kind from the first\r\nclass. To the average man it is probably more useful to study this\r\nsecond type of success than to study the first. From the study of the\r\nfirst he can learn inspiration, he can get uplift and lofty enthusiasm.\r\nFrom the study of the second he can, if he chooses, find out how to win\r\na similar success himself.\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that all the successes I have ever won have been\r\nof the second type. I never won anything without hard labor and the\r\nexercise of my best judgment and careful planning and working long in\r\nadvance. Having been a rather sickly and awkward boy, I was as a young\r\nman at first both nervous and distrustful of my own prowess. I had to\r\ntrain myself painfully and laboriously not merely as regards my body but\r\nas regards my soul and spirit.\r\n\r\nWhen a boy I read a passage in one of Marryat's books which always\r\nimpressed me. In this passage the captain of some small British\r\nman-of-war is explaining to the hero how to acquire the quality of\r\nfearlessness. He says that at the outset almost every man is frightened\r\nwhen he goes into action, but that the course to follow is for the man\r\nto keep such a grip on himself that he can act just as if he was not\r\nfrightened. After this is kept up long enough it changes from pretense\r\nto reality, and the man does in very fact become fearless by sheer dint\r\nof practicing fearlessness when he does not feel it. (I am using my own\r\nlanguage, not Marryat's.) This was the theory upon which I went. There\r\nwere all kinds of things of which I was afraid at first, ranging from\r\ngrizzly bears to \"mean\" horses and gun-fighters; but by acting as if I\r\nwas not afraid I gradually ceased to be afraid. Most men can have the\r\nsame experience if they choose. They will first learn to bear themselves\r\nwell in trials which they anticipate and which they school themselves\r\nin advance to meet. After a while the habit will grow on them, and they\r\nwill behave well in sudden and unexpected emergencies which come upon\r\nthem unawares.\r\n\r\nIt is of course much pleasanter if one is naturally fearless, and I envy\r\nand respect the men who are naturally fearless. But it is a good\r\nthing to remember that the man who does not enjoy this advantage can\r\nnevertheless stand beside the man who does, and can do his duty with the\r\nlike efficiency, if he chooses to. Of course he must not let his\r\ndesire take the form merely of a day-dream. Let him dream about being\r\na fearless man, and the more he dreams the better he will be, always\r\nprovided he does his best to realize the dream in practice. He can do\r\nhis part honorably and well provided only he sets fearlessness before\r\nhimself as an ideal, schools himself to think of danger merely as\r\nsomething to be faced and overcome, and regards life itself as he should\r\nregard it, not as something to be thrown away, but as a pawn to be\r\npromptly hazarded whenever the hazard is warranted by the larger\r\ninterests of the great game in which we are all engaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL POLITICS\r\n\r\nWhen I left Harvard, I took up the study of law. If I had been\r\nsufficiently fortunate to come under Professor Thayer, of the Harvard\r\nLaw School, it may well be that I would have realized that the lawyer\r\ncan do a great work for justice and against legalism.\r\n\r\nBut, doubtless chiefly through my own fault, some of the teaching of the\r\nlaw books and of the classroom seemed to me to be against justice.\r\nThe _caveat emptor_ side of the law, like the _caveat emptor_ side\r\nof business, seemed to me repellent; it did not make for social fair\r\ndealing. The \"let the buyer beware\" maxim, when translated into actual\r\npractice, whether in law or business, tends to translate itself further\r\ninto the seller making his profit at the expense of the buyer, instead\r\nof by a bargain which shall be to the profit of both. It did not seem\r\nto me that the law was framed to discourage as it should sharp practice,\r\nand all other kinds of bargains except those which are fair and of\r\nbenefit to both sides. I was young; there was much in the judgment which\r\nI then formed on this matter which I should now revise; but, then as\r\nnow, many of the big corporation lawyers, to whom the ordinary members\r\nof the bar then as now looked up, held certain standards which were\r\ndifficult to recognize as compatible with the idealism I suppose every\r\nhigh-minded young man is apt to feel. If I had been obliged to earn\r\nevery cent I spent, I should have gone whole-heartedly into the business\r\nof making both ends meet, and should have taken up the law or any other\r\nrespectable occupation--for I then held, and now hold, the belief that\r\na man's first duty is to pull his own weight and to take care of those\r\ndependent upon him; and I then believed, and now believe, that the\r\ngreatest privilege and greatest duty for any man is to be happily\r\nmarried, and that no other form of success or service, for either man\r\nor woman, can be wisely accepted as a substitute or alternative. But it\r\nhappened that I had been left enough money by my father not to make\r\nit necessary for me to think solely of earning bread for myself and my\r\nfamily. I had enough to get bread. What I had to do, if I wanted butter\r\nand jam, was to provide the butter and jam, but to count their cost\r\nas compared with other things. In other words, I made up my mind that,\r\nwhile I must earn money, I could afford to make earning money the\r\nsecondary instead of the primary object of my career. If I had had\r\nno money at all, then my first duty would have been to earn it in any\r\nhonest fashion. As I had some money I felt that my need for more money\r\nwas to be treated as a secondary need, and that while it was my business\r\nto make more money where I legitimately and properly could, yet that it\r\nwas also my business to treat other kinds of work as more important than\r\nmoney-making.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after leaving Harvard in 1880 I began to take an\r\ninterest in politics. I did not then believe, and I do not now believe,\r\nthat any man should ever attempt to make politics his only career. It\r\nis a dreadful misfortune for a man to grow to feel that his whole\r\nlivelihood and whole happiness depend upon his staying in office. Such\r\na feeling prevents him from being of real service to the people while\r\nin office, and always puts him under the heaviest strain of pressure to\r\nbarter his convictions for the sake of holding office. A man should have\r\nsome other occupation--I had several other occupations--to which he can\r\nresort if at any time he is thrown out of office, or if at any time he\r\nfinds it necessary to choose a course which will probably result in\r\nhis being thrown out, unless he is willing to stay in at cost to his\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nAt that day, in 1880, a young man of my bringing up and convictions\r\ncould join only the Republican party, and join it I accordingly did.\r\nIt was no simple thing to join it then. That was long before the era of\r\nballot reform and the control of primaries; long before the era when we\r\nrealized that the Government must take official notice of the deeds and\r\nacts of party organizations. The party was still treated as a private\r\ncorporation, and in each district the organization formed a kind of\r\nsocial and political club. A man had to be regularly proposed for and\r\nelected into this club, just as into any other club. As a friend of mine\r\npicturesquely phrased it, I \"had to break into the organization with a\r\njimmy.\"\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances there was some difficulty in joining the local\r\norganization, and considerable amusement and excitement to be obtained\r\nout of it after I had joined.\r\n\r\nIt was over thirty-three years ago that I thus became a member of the\r\nTwenty-first District Republican Association in the city of New York.\r\nThe men I knew best were the men in the clubs of social pretension\r\nand the men of cultivated taste and easy life. When I began to make\r\ninquiries as to the whereabouts of the local Republican Association and\r\nthe means of joining it, these men--and the big business men and lawyers\r\nalso--laughed at me, and told me that politics were \"low\"; that the\r\norganizations were not controlled by \"gentlemen\"; that I would find them\r\nrun by saloon-keepers, horse-car conductors, and the like, and not by\r\nmen with any of whom I would come in contact outside; and, moreover,\r\nthey assured me that the men I met would be rough and brutal and\r\nunpleasant to deal with. I answered that if this were so it merely meant\r\nthat the people I knew did not belong to the governing class, and that\r\nthe other people did--and that I intended to be one of the governing\r\nclass; that if they proved too hard-bit for me I supposed I would have\r\nto quit, but that I certainly would not quit until I had made the effort\r\nand found out whether I really was too weak to hold my own in the rough\r\nand tumble.\r\n\r\nThe Republican Association of which I became a member held its meetings\r\nin Morton Hall, a large, barn-like room over a saloon. Its furniture was\r\nof the canonical kind: dingy benches, spittoons, a dais at one end with\r\na table and chair and a stout pitcher for iced water, and on the walls\r\npictures of General Grant, and of Levi P. Morton, to whose generosity\r\nwe owed the room. We had regular meetings once or twice a month, and\r\nbetween times the place was treated, at least on certain nights, as a\r\nkind of club-room. I went around there often enough to have the men get\r\naccustomed to me and to have me get accustomed to them, so that we began\r\nto speak the same language, and so that each could begin to live down in\r\nthe other's mind what Bret Harte has called \"the defective moral quality\r\nof being a stranger.\" It is not often that a man can make opportunities\r\nfor himself. But he can put himself in such shape that when or if the\r\nopportunities come he is ready to take advantage of them. This was what\r\nhappened to me in connection with my experiences in Morton Hall. I soon\r\nbecame on good terms with a number of the ordinary \"heelers\" and even\r\nsome of the minor leaders. The big leader was Jake Hess, who treated\r\nme with rather distant affability. There were prominent lawyers and\r\nbusiness men who belonged, but they took little part in the actual\r\nmeetings. What they did was done elsewhere. The running of the machine\r\nwas left to Jake Hess and his captains of tens and of hundreds.\r\n\r\nAmong these lesser captains I soon struck up a friendship with Joe\r\nMurray, a friendship which is as strong now as it was thirty-three years\r\nago. He had been born in Ireland, but brought to New York by his parents\r\nwhen he was three or four years old, and, as he expressed it, \"raised as\r\na barefooted boy on First Avenue.\" When not eighteen he had enlisted in\r\nthe Army of the Potomac and taken part in the campaign that closed the\r\nCivil War. Then he came back to First Avenue, and, being a fearless,\r\npowerful, energetic young fellow, careless and reckless, speedily grew\r\nto some prominence as leader of a gang. In that district, and at that\r\ntime, politics was a rough business, and Tammany Hall held unquestioned\r\nsway. The district was overwhelmingly Democratic, and Joe and his\r\nfriends were Democrats who on election day performed the usual gang\r\nwork for the local Democratic leader, whose business it was to favor and\r\nreward them in return. This same local leader, like many other greater\r\nleaders, became puffed up by prosperity, and forgot the instruments\r\nthrough which he had achieved prosperity. After one election he showed a\r\ncallous indifference to the hard work of the gang and complete disregard\r\nof his before-election promises. He counted upon the resentment wearing\r\nitself out, as usual, in threats and bluster.\r\n\r\nBut Joe Murray was not a man who forgot. He explained to his gang his\r\npurposes and the necessity of being quiet. Accordingly they waited for\r\ntheir revenge until the next election day. They then, as Joe expressed\r\nit, decided \"to vote furdest away from the leader\"--I am using the\r\nlanguage of Joe's youth--and the best way to do this was to vote\r\nthe Republican ticket. In those days each party had a booth near the\r\npolling-place in each election district, where the party representative\r\ndispensed the party ballots. This had been a district in which, as a\r\nrule, very early in the day the Republican election leader had his\r\nhat knocked over his eyes and his booth kicked over and his ballots\r\nscattered; and then the size of the Democratic majority depended on an\r\nelastic appreciation of exactly how much was demanded from headquarters.\r\nBut on this day things went differently. The gang, with a Roman sense\r\nof duty, took an active interest in seeing that the Republican was given\r\nhis full rights. Moreover, they made the most energetic reprisals on\r\ntheir opponents, and as they were distinctly the tough and fighting\r\nelement, justice came to her own with a whoop. Would-be repeaters were\r\nthrown out on their heads. Every person who could be cajoled or, I fear,\r\nintimidated, was given the Republican ticket, and the upshot was that at\r\nthe end of the day a district which had never hitherto polled more than\r\ntwo or three per cent of its vote Republican broke about even between\r\nthe two parties.\r\n\r\nTo Joe it had been merely an act of retribution in so far as it was not\r\nsimply a spree. But the leaders at the Republican headquarters did not\r\nknow this, and when they got over their paralyzed astonishment at the\r\nreturns, they investigated to find out what it meant. Somebody told\r\nthem that it represented the work of a young man named Joseph Murray.\r\nAccordingly they sent for him. The room in which they received him was\r\ndoubtless some place like Morton Hall, and the men who received him were\r\nakin to those who had leadership in Morton Hall; but in Joe's eyes\r\nthey stood for a higher civilization, for opportunity, for generous\r\nrecognition of successful effort--in short, for all the things that an\r\neager young man desires. He was received and patted on the back by a man\r\nwho was a great man to the world in which he lived. He was introduced\r\nto the audience as a young man whose achievement was such as to\r\npromise much for the future, and moreover he was given a place in the\r\npost-office--as I have said, this was long before the day of Civil\r\nService Reform.\r\n\r\nNow, to the wrong kind of man all this might have meant nothing at\r\nall. But in Joe Murray's case it meant everything. He was by nature as\r\nstraight a man, as fearless and as stanchly loyal, as any one whom I\r\nhave ever met, a man to be trusted in any position demanding courage,\r\nintegrity, and good faith. He did his duty in the public service, and\r\nbecame devotedly attached to the organization which he felt had given\r\nhim his chance in life. When I knew him he was already making his\r\nway up; one of the proofs and evidences of which was that he owned a\r\nfirst-class racing trotter--\"Alice Lane\"--behind which he gave me more\r\nthan one spin. During this first winter I grew to like Joe and his\r\nparticular cronies. But I had no idea that they especially returned the\r\nliking, and in the first row we had in the organization (which arose\r\nover a movement, that I backed, to stand by a non-partisan method of\r\nstreet-cleaning) Joe and all his friends stood stiffly with the machine,\r\nand my side, the reform side, was left with only some half-dozen votes\r\nout of three or four hundred. I had expected no other outcome and took\r\nit good-humoredly, but without changing my attitude.\r\n\r\nNext fall, as the elections drew near, Joe thought he would like to make\r\na drive at Jake Hess, and after considerable planning decided that his\r\nbest chance lay in the fight for the nomination to the Assembly, the\r\nlower house of the Legislature. He picked me as the candidate with whom\r\nhe would be most likely to win; and win he did. It was not my fight, it\r\nwas Joe's; and it was to him that I owe my entry into politics. I had\r\nat that time neither the reputation nor the ability to have won the\r\nnomination for myself, and indeed never would have thought of trying for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nJake Hess was entirely good-humored about it. In spite of my being\r\nanti-machine, my relations with him had been friendly and human, and\r\nwhen he was beaten he turned in to help Joe elect me. At first they\r\nthought they would take me on a personal canvass through the saloons\r\nalong Sixth Avenue. The canvass, however, did not last beyond the first\r\nsaloon. I was introduced with proper solemnity to the saloon-keeper--a\r\nvery important personage, for this was before the days when\r\nsaloon-keepers became merely the mortgaged chattels of the brewers--and\r\nhe began to cross-examine me, a little too much in the tone of one who\r\nwas dealing with a suppliant for his favor. He said he expected that I\r\nwould of course treat the liquor business fairly; to which I answered,\r\nnone too cordially, that I hoped I should treat all interests fairly.\r\nHe then said that he regarded the licenses as too high; to which I\r\nresponded that I believed they were really not high enough, and that\r\nI should try to have them made higher. The conversation threatened to\r\nbecome stormy. Messrs. Murray and Hess, on some hastily improvised plea,\r\ntook me out into the street, and then Joe explained to me that it was\r\nnot worth my while staying in Sixth Avenue any longer, that I had better\r\ngo right back to Fifth Avenue and attend to my friends there, and that\r\nhe would look after my interests on Sixth Avenue. I was triumphantly\r\nelected.\r\n\r\nOnce before Joe had interfered in similar fashion and secured the\r\nnomination of an Assemblyman; and shortly after election he had grown\r\nto feel toward this Assemblyman that he must have fed on the meat which\r\nrendered Caesar proud, as he became inaccessible to the ordinary mortals\r\nwhose place of resort was Morton Hall. He eyed me warily for a\r\nshort time to see if I was likely in this respect to follow in my\r\npredecessor's footsteps. Finding that I did not, he and all my other\r\nfriends and supporters assumed toward me the very pleasantest attitude\r\nthat it was possible to assume. They did not ask me for a thing. They\r\naccepted as a matter of course the view that I was absolutely straight\r\nand was trying to do the best I could in the Legislature. They desired\r\nnothing except that I should make a success, and they supported me with\r\nhearty enthusiasm. I am a little at a loss to know quite how to express\r\nthe quality in my relationship with Joe Murray and my other friends of\r\nthis period which rendered that relationship so beneficial to me. When I\r\nwent into politics at this time I was not conscious of going in with\r\nthe set purpose to benefit other people, but of getting for myself a\r\nprivilege to which I was entitled in common with other people. So it was\r\nin my relationship with these men. If there had lurked in the innermost\r\nrecesses of my mind anywhere the thought that I was in some way a\r\npatron or a benefactor, or was doing something noble by taking part\r\nin politics, or that I expected the smallest consideration save what\r\nI could earn on my own merits, I am certain that somehow or other the\r\nexistence of that feeling would have been known and resented. As a\r\nmatter of fact, there was not the slightest temptation on my part to\r\nhave any such feeling or any one of such feelings. I no more expected\r\nspecial consideration in politics than I would have expected it in the\r\nboxing ring. I wished to act squarely to others, and I wished to be able\r\nto show that I could hold my own as against others. The attitude of my\r\nnew friends toward me was first one of polite reserve, and then that of\r\nfriendly alliance. Afterwards I became admitted to comradeship, and then\r\nto leadership. I need hardly say how earnestly I believe that men should\r\nhave a keen and lively sense of their obligations in politics, of their\r\nduty to help forward great causes, and to struggle for the betterment of\r\nconditions that are unjust to their fellows, the men and women who are\r\nless fortunate in life. But in addition to this feeling there must be a\r\nfeeling of real fellowship with the other men and women engaged in the\r\nsame task, fellowship of work, with fun to vary the work; for unless\r\nthere is this feeling of fellowship, of common effort on an equal plane\r\nfor a common end, it will be difficult to keep the relations wholesome\r\nand natural. To be patronized is as offensive as to be insulted. No one\r\nof us cares permanently to have some one else conscientiously striving\r\nto do him good; what we want is to work with that some one else for the\r\ngood of both of us--any man will speedily find that other people can\r\nbenefit him just as much as he can benefit them.\r\n\r\nNeither Joe Murray nor I nor any of our associates at that time were\r\nalive to social and industrial needs which we now all of us recognize.\r\nBut we then had very clearly before our minds the need of practically\r\napplying certain elemental virtues, the virtues of honesty and\r\nefficiency in politics, the virtue of efficiency side by side with\r\nhonesty in private and public life alike, the virtues of consideration\r\nand fair dealing in business as between man and man, and especially as\r\nbetween the man who is an employer and the man who is an employee.\r\nOn all fundamental questions Joe Murray and I thought alike. We never\r\nparted company excepting on the question of Civil Service Reform, where\r\nhe sincerely felt that I showed doctrinaire affinities, that I sided\r\nwith the pharisees. We got back again into close relations as soon as\r\nI became Police Commissioner under Mayor Strong, for Joe was then made\r\nExcise Commissioner, and was, I believe, the best Excise Commissioner\r\nthe city of New York ever had. He is now a farmer, his boys have been\r\nthrough Columbia College, and he and I look at the questions, political,\r\nsocial, and industrial, which confront us in 1913 from practically the\r\nsame standpoint, just as we once looked at the questions that confronted\r\nus in 1881.\r\n\r\nThere are many debts that I owe Joe Murray, and some for which he was\r\nonly unconsciously responsible. I do not think that a man is fit to do\r\ngood work in our American democracy unless he is able to have a\r\ngenuine fellow-feeling for, understanding of, and sympathy with his\r\nfellow-Americans, whatever their creed or their birthplace, the section\r\nin which they live, or the work which they do, provided they possess\r\nthe only kind of Americanism that really counts, the Americanism of the\r\nspirit. It was no small help to me, in the effort to make myself a good\r\ncitizen and good American, that the political associate with whom I was\r\non closest and most intimate terms during my early years was a man born\r\nin Ireland, by creed a Catholic, with Joe Murray's upbringing; just\r\nas it helped me greatly at a later period to work for certain vitally\r\nnecessary public needs with Arthur von Briesen, in whom the spirit of\r\nthe \"Acht-und-Vierziger\" idealists was embodied; just as my whole life\r\nwas influenced by my long association with Jacob Riis, whom I am tempted\r\nto call the best American I ever knew, although he was already a young\r\nman when he came hither from Denmark.\r\n\r\nI was elected to the Legislature in the fall of 1881, and found myself\r\nthe youngest man in that body. I was reelected the two following\r\nyears. Like all young men and inexperienced members, I had considerable\r\ndifficulty in teaching myself to speak. I profited much by the advice\r\nof a hard-headed old countryman--who was unconsciously paraphrasing\r\nthe Duke of Wellington, who was himself doubtless paraphrasing somebody\r\nelse. The advice ran: \"Don't speak until you are sure you have something\r\nto say, and know just what it is; then say it, and sit down.\"\r\n\r\nMy first days in the Legislature were much like those of a boy in a\r\nstrange school. My fellow-legislators and I eyed one another with mutual\r\ndistrust. Each of us chose his seat, each began by following the lead of\r\nsome veteran in the first routine matters, and then, in a week or two,\r\nwe began to drift into groups according to our several affinities. The\r\nLegislature was Democratic. I was a Republican from the \"silk stocking\"\r\ndistrict, the wealthiest district in New York, and I was put, as one\r\nof the minority members, on the Committee of Cities. It was a coveted\r\nposition. I did not make any effort to get on, and, as far as I know,\r\nwas put there merely because it was felt to be in accordance with the\r\nfitness of things.\r\n\r\nA very short experience showed me that, as the Legislature was then\r\nconstituted, the so-called party contests had no interest whatever for\r\nme. There was no real party division on most of the things that were of\r\nconcern in State politics, both Republicans and Democrats being for and\r\nagainst them. My friendships were made, not with regard to party\r\nlines, but because I found, and my friends found, that we had the same\r\nconvictions on questions of principle and questions of policy. The only\r\ndifference was that there was a larger proportion of these men among the\r\nRepublicans than among the Democrats, and that it was easier for me at\r\nthe outset to scrape acquaintance, among the men who felt as I did, with\r\nthe Republicans. They were for the most part from the country districts.\r\n\r\nMy closest friend for the three years I was there was Billy O'Neill,\r\nfrom the Adirondacks. He kept a small crossroads store. He was a young\r\nman, although a few years older than I was, and, like myself, had won\r\nhis position without regard to the machine. He had thought he would\r\nlike to be Assemblyman, so he had taken his buggy and had driven around\r\nFranklin County visiting everybody, had upset the local ring, and came\r\nto the Legislature as his own master. There is surely something in\r\nAmerican traditions that does tend toward real democracy in spite of our\r\nfaults and shortcomings. In most other countries two men of as different\r\nantecedents, ancestry, and surroundings as Billy O'Neill and I would\r\nhave had far more difficulty in coming together. I came from the biggest\r\ncity in America and from the wealthiest ward of that city, and he from\r\na backwoods county where he kept a store at a crossroads. In all the\r\nunimportant things we seemed far apart. But in all the important things\r\nwe were close together. We looked at all questions from substantially\r\nthe same view-point, and we stood shoulder to shoulder in every\r\nlegislative fight during those three years. He abhorred demagogy just\r\nas he abhorred corruption. He had thought much on political problems; he\r\nadmired Alexander Hamilton as much as I did, being a strong believer\r\nin a powerful National government; and we both of us differed from\r\nAlexander Hamilton in being stout adherents of Abraham Lincoln's views\r\nwherever the rights of the people were concerned. Any man who has met\r\nwith success, if he will be frank with himself, must admit that there\r\nhas been a big element of fortune in the success. Fortune favored me,\r\nwhereas her hand was heavy against Billy O'Neill. All his life he had to\r\nstrive hard to wring his bread from harsh surroundings and a reluctant\r\nfate; if fate had been but a little kinder, I believe he would have had\r\na great political career; and he would have done good service for the\r\ncountry in any position in which he might have been put.\r\n\r\nThere were other Republicans, like Isaac Hunt and Jonas van Duzer and\r\nWalter Howe and Henry Sprague, who were among my close friends and\r\nallies; and a gigantic one-eyed veteran of the Civil War, a gallant\r\nGeneral, Curtis from St. Lawrence County; and a capital fellow, whom\r\nafterwards, when Governor, I put on the bench, Kruse, from Cattaraugus\r\nCounty. Kruse was a German by birth; as far as I know, the only German\r\nfrom Cattaraugus County at that time; and, besides being a German, he\r\nwas also a Prohibitionist. Among the Democrats were Hamden Robb and\r\nThomas Newbold, and Tom Welch of Niagara, who did a great service in\r\ngetting the State to set aside Niagara Falls Park--after a discouraging\r\nexperience with the first Governor before whom we brought the bill, who\r\nlistened with austere patience to our arguments in favor of the State\r\nestablishing a park, and then conclusively answered us by the question,\r\n\"But, gentlemen, why should we spend the people's money when just as\r\nmuch water will run over the Falls without a park as with it?\" Then\r\nthere were a couple of members from New York and Brooklyn, Mike Costello\r\nand Pete Kelly.\r\n\r\nMike Costello had been elected as a Tammany man. He was as fearless as\r\nhe was honest. He came from Ireland, and had accepted the Tammany Fourth\r\nof July orations as indicating the real attitude of that organization\r\ntowards the rights of the people. A month or two in Albany converted him\r\nto a profound distrust of applied Tammany methods. He and I worked\r\nhand in hand with equal indifference to our local machines. His machine\r\nleaders warned him fairly that they would throw him out at the next\r\nelection, which they did; but he possessed a seasoned-hickory toughness\r\nof ability to contend with adverse circumstances, and kept his head well\r\nabove water. A better citizen does not exist; and our friendship has\r\nnever faltered.\r\n\r\nPeter Kelly's fate was a tragedy. He was a bright, well-educated young\r\nfellow, an ardent believer in Henry George. At the beginning he and I\r\nfailed to understand each other or to get on together, for our theories\r\nof government were radically opposed. After a couple of months spent in\r\nactive contests with men whose theories had nothing whatever to do with\r\ntheir practices, Kelly and I found in our turn that it really did not\r\nmake much difference what our abstract theories were on questions that\r\nwere not before the Legislature, in view of the fact that on the actual\r\nmatters before the Legislature, the most important of which involved\r\nquestions of elementary morality, we were heartily at one. We began to\r\nvote together and act together, and by the end of the session found that\r\nin all practical matters that were up for action we thought together.\r\nIndeed, each of us was beginning to change his theories, so that even\r\nin theory we were coming closer together. He was ardent and generous; he\r\nwas a young lawyer, with a wife and children, whose ambition had tempted\r\nhim into politics, and who had been befriended by the local bosses\r\nunder the belief that they could count upon him for anything they really\r\nwished. Unfortunately, what they really wished was often corrupt. Kelly\r\ndefied them, fought the battles of the people with ardor and good faith,\r\nand when the bosses refused him a renomination, he appealed from them\r\nto the people. When we both came up for reelection, I won easily in my\r\ndistrict, where circumstances conspired to favor me; and Kelly, with\r\nexactly the same record that I had, except that it was more creditable\r\nbecause he took his stand against greater odds, was beaten in his\r\ndistrict. Defeat to me would have meant merely chagrin; to Kelly it\r\nmeant terrible material disaster. He had no money. Like every rigidly\r\nhonest man, he had found that going into politics was expensive and that\r\nhis salary as Assemblyman did not cover the financial outgo. He had lost\r\nhis practice and he had incurred the ill will of the powerful, so that\r\nit was impossible at the moment to pick up his practice again; and\r\nthe worry and disappointment affected him so much that shortly after\r\nelection he was struck down by sickness. Just before Christmas some of\r\nus were informed that Kelly was in such financial straits that he and\r\nhis family would be put out into the street before New Year. This was\r\nprevented by the action of some of his friends who had served with him\r\nin the Legislature, and he recovered, at least to a degree, and took\r\nup the practice of his profession. But he was a broken man. In the\r\nLegislature in which he served one of his fellow-Democrats from\r\nBrooklyn was the Speaker--Alfred C. Chapin, the leader and the foremost\r\nrepresentative of the reform Democracy, whom Kelly zealously supported.\r\nA few years later Chapin, a very able man, was elected Mayor of Brooklyn\r\non a reform Democratic ticket. Shortly after his election I was asked\r\nto speak at a meeting in a Brooklyn club at which various prominent\r\ncitizens, including the Mayor, were present. I spoke on civic decency,\r\nand toward the close of my speech I sketched Kelly's career for my\r\naudience, told them how he had stood up for the rights of the people of\r\nBrooklyn, and how the people had failed to stand up for him, and the way\r\nhe had been punished, precisely because he had been a good citizen who\r\nacted as a good citizen should act. I ended by saying that the reform\r\nDemocracy had now come into power, that Mr. Chapin was Mayor, and that I\r\nvery earnestly hoped recognition would at last be given to Kelly for the\r\nfight he had waged at such bitter cost to himself. My words created some\r\nimpression, and Mayor Chapin at once said that he would take care of\r\nKelly and see that justice was done him. I went home that evening much\r\npleased. In the morning, at breakfast, I received a brief note from\r\nChapin in these words: \"It was nine last evening when you finished\r\nspeaking of what Kelly had done, and when I said that I would take care\r\nof him. At ten last night Kelly died.\" He had been dying while I was\r\nmaking my speech, and he never knew that at last there was to be a\r\ntardy recognition of what he had done, a tardy justification for the\r\nsacrifices he had made. The man had fought, at heavy cost to himself and\r\nwith entire disinterestedness, for popular rights; but no recognition\r\nfor what he had done had come to him from the people, whose interest he\r\nhad so manfully upheld.\r\n\r\nWhere there is no chance of statistical or mathematical measurement, it\r\nis very hard to tell just the degree to which conditions change from one\r\nperiod to another. This is peculiarly hard to do when we deal with such\r\na matter as corruption. Personally I am inclined to think that in public\r\nlife we are on the whole a little better and not a little worse than we\r\nwere thirty years ago, when I was serving in the New York Legislature.\r\nI think the conditions are a little better in National, in State, and in\r\nmunicipal politics. Doubtless there are points in which they are worse,\r\nand there is an enormous amount that needs reformation. But it does seem\r\nto me as if, on the whole, things had slightly improved.\r\n\r\nWhen I went into politics, New York City was under the control of\r\nTammany, which was from time to time opposed by some other--and\r\nevanescent--city Democratic organization. The up-country Democrats had\r\nnot yet fallen under Tammany sway, and were on the point of developing a\r\nbig country political boss in the shape of David B. Hill. The Republican\r\nparty was split into the Stalwart and Half-Breed factions. Accordingly\r\nneither party had one dominant boss, or one dominant machine, each being\r\ncontrolled by jarring and warring bosses and machines. The corruption\r\nwas not what it had been in the days of Tweed, when outside individuals\r\ncontrolled the legislators like puppets. Nor was there any such\r\ncentralization of the boss system as occurred later. Many of the members\r\nwere under the control of local bosses or local machines. But the\r\ncorrupt work was usually done through the members directly.\r\n\r\nOf course I never had anything in the nature of legal proof of\r\ncorruption, and the figures I am about to give are merely approximate.\r\nBut three years' experience convinced me, in the first place, that there\r\nwere a great many thoroughly corrupt men in the Legislature, perhaps a\r\nthird of the whole number; and, in the next place, that the honest men\r\noutnumbered the corrupt men, and that, if it were ever possible to get\r\nan issue of right and wrong put vividly and unmistakably before them\r\nin a way that would arrest their attention and that would arrest the\r\nattention of their constituents, we could count on the triumph of the\r\nright. The trouble was that in most cases the issue was confused. To\r\nread some kinds of literature one would come to the conclusion that the\r\nonly corruption in legislative circles was in the form of bribery by\r\ncorporations, and that the line was sharp between the honest man who was\r\nalways voting against corporations and the dishonest man who was always\r\nbribed to vote for them. My experience was the direct contrary of\r\nthis. For every one bill introduced (not passed) corruptly to favor a\r\ncorporation, there were at least ten introduced (not passed, and in this\r\ncase not intended to be passed) to blackmail corporations. The majority\r\nof the corrupt members would be found voting for the blackmailing bills\r\nif they were not paid, and would also be found voting in the interests\r\nof the corporation if they were paid. The blackmailing, or, as they were\r\nalways called, the \"strike\" bills, could themselves be roughly divided\r\ninto two categories: bills which it would have been proper to pass,\r\nand those that it would not have been proper to pass. Some of the bills\r\naimed at corporations were utterly wild and improper; and of these a\r\nproportion might be introduced by honest and foolish zealots, whereas\r\nmost of them were introduced by men who had not the slightest intention\r\nof passing them, but who wished to be paid not to pass them. The most\r\nprofitable type of bill to the accomplished blackmailer, however, was a\r\nbill aimed at a real corporate abuse which the corporation, either from\r\nwickedness or folly, was unwilling to remedy. Of the measures introduced\r\nin the interest of corporations there were also some that were proper\r\nand some that were improper. The corrupt legislators, the \"black horse\r\ncavalry,\" as they were termed, would demand payment to vote as the\r\ncorporations wished, no matter whether the bill was proper or improper.\r\nSometimes, if the bill was a proper one, the corporation would have the\r\nvirtue or the strength of mind to refuse to pay for its passage, and\r\nsometimes it would not.\r\n\r\nA very slight consideration of the above state of affairs will show\r\nhow difficult it was at times to keep the issue clear, for honest and\r\ndishonest men were continually found side by side voting now against and\r\nnow for a corporation measure, the one set from proper and the other set\r\nfrom grossly improper motives. Of course part of the fault lay in the\r\nattitudes of outsiders. It was very early borne in upon me that almost\r\nequal harm was done by indiscriminate defense of, and indiscriminate\r\nattack on, corporations. It was hard to say whether the man who prided\r\nhimself upon always antagonizing the corporations, or the man who, on\r\nthe plea that he was a good conservative, always stood up for them, was\r\nthe more mischievous agent of corruption and demoralization.\r\n\r\nIn one fight in the House over a bill as to which there was a bitter\r\ncontest between two New York City street railway organizations, I saw\r\nlobbyists come down on the floor itself and draw venal men out into the\r\nlobbies with almost no pretense of concealing what they were doing.\r\nIn another case in which the elevated railway corporations of New York\r\nCity, against the protest of the Mayor and the other local authorities,\r\nrushed through a bill remitting over half their taxes, some of the\r\nmembers who voted for the measure probably thought it was right; but\r\nevery corrupt man in the House voted with them; and the man must\r\nindeed have been stupid who thought that these votes were given\r\ndisinterestedly.\r\n\r\nThe effective fight against this bill for the revision of the elevated\r\nrailway taxes--perhaps the most openly crooked measure which during my\r\ntime was pushed at Albany--was waged by Mike Costello and myself. We\r\nused to spend a good deal of time in industrious research into the\r\nvarious bills introduced, so as to find out what their authors really\r\nhad in mind; this research, by the way, being highly unappreciated and\r\nmuch resented by the authors. In the course of his researches Mike\r\nhad been puzzled by an unimportant bill, seemingly related to a\r\nConstitutional amendment, introduced by a local saloon-keeper, whose\r\ninterests, as far as we knew, were wholly remote from the Constitution,\r\nor from any form of abstract legal betterment. However, the measure\r\nseemed harmless; we did not interfere; and it passed the House. Mike,\r\nhowever, followed its career in the Senate, and at the last moment,\r\nalmost by accident, discovered that it had been \"amended\" by the\r\nsimple process of striking out everything after the enacting clause and\r\nunobtrusively substituting the proposal to remit the elevated railway\r\ntaxes! The authors of the change wished to avoid unseemly publicity;\r\ntheir hope was to slip the measure through the Legislature and have\r\nit instantly signed by the Governor, before any public attention was\r\nexcited. In the Senate their plan worked to perfection. There was in\r\nthe Senate no fighting leadership of the forces of decency; and for such\r\nleadership of the non-fighting type the representatives of corruption\r\ncared absolutely nothing. By bold and adroit management the substitution\r\nin the Senate was effected without opposition or comment. The bill (in\r\nreality, of course, an absolutely new and undebated bill) then came back\r\nto the House nominally as a merely amended measure, which, under the\r\nrules, was not open to debate unless the amendment was first by vote\r\nrejected. This was the great bill of the session for the lobby; and\r\nthe lobby was keenly alive to the need of quick, wise action. No public\r\nattention whatever had so far been excited. Every measure was taken\r\nto secure immediate and silent action. A powerful leader, whom the\r\nbeneficiaries of the bill trusted, a fearless and unscrupulous man,\r\nof much force and great knowledge of parliamentary law, was put in the\r\nchair. Costello and I were watched; and when for a moment we were out\r\nof the House, the bill was brought over from the Senate, and the clerk\r\nbegan to read it, all the black horse cavalry, in expectant mood, being\r\nin their seats. But Mike Costello, who was in the clerk's room, happened\r\nto catch a few words of what was being read. In he rushed, despatched a\r\nmessenger for me, and began a single-handed filibuster. The Speaker\r\npro tem called him to order. Mike continued to speak and protest;\r\nthe Speaker hammered him down; Mike continued his protests; the\r\nsergeant-at-arms was sent to arrest and remove him; and then I bounced\r\nin, and continued the protest, and refused to sit down or be silent.\r\nAmid wild confusion the amendment was declared adopted, and the bill\r\nwas ordered engrossed and sent to the Governor. But we had carried our\r\npoint. The next morning the whole press rang with what had happened;\r\nevery detail of the bill, and every detail of the way it had been\r\nslipped through the Legislature, were made public. All the slow and\r\ncautious men in the House, who had been afraid of taking sides, now came\r\nforward in support of us. Another debate was held on the proposal to\r\nrescind the vote; the city authorities waked up to protest; the\r\nGovernor refused to sign the bill. Two or three years later, after much\r\nlitigation, the taxes were paid; in the newspapers it was stated that\r\nthe amount was over $1,500,000. It was Mike Costello to whom primarily\r\nwas due the fact that this sum was saved the public, and that the forces\r\nof corruption received a stinging rebuff. He did not expect recognition\r\nor reward for his services; and he got none. The public, if it knew of\r\nwhat he had done, promptly forgot it. The machine did not forget it, and\r\nturned him down at the next election.\r\n\r\nOne of the stand-by \"strikes\" was a bill for reducing the elevated\r\nrailway fare, which at that time was ten cents, to five cents. In\r\none Legislature the men responsible for the introduction of the bill\r\nsuffered such an extraordinary change of heart that when the bill\r\ncame up--being pushed by zealous radicals who really were honest--the\r\nintroducers actually voted against it! A number of us who had been very\r\ndoubtful about the principle of the bill voted for it simply because\r\nwe were convinced that money was being used to stop it, and we hated to\r\nseem to side with the corruptionists. Then there came a wave of popular\r\nfeeling in its favor, the bill was reintroduced at the next session,\r\nthe railways very wisely decided that they would simply fight it on its\r\nmerits, and the entire black horse cavalry contingent, together with all\r\nthe former friends of the measure, voted against it. Some of us, who in\r\nour anger at the methods formerly resorted to for killing the bill had\r\nvoted for it the previous year, with much heart-searching again voted\r\nfor it, as I now think unwisely; and the bill was vetoed by the then\r\nGovernor, Grover Cleveland. I believe the veto was proper, and those\r\nwho felt as I did supported the veto; for although it was entirely right\r\nthat the fare should be reduced to five cents, which was soon afterwards\r\ndone, the method was unwise, and would have set a mischievous precedent.\r\n\r\nAn instance of an opposite kind occurred in connection with a great\r\nrailway corporation which wished to increase its terminal facilities in\r\none of our great cities. The representatives of the railway brought\r\nthe bill to me and asked me to look into it, saying that they were well\r\naware that it was the kind of bill that lent itself to blackmail, and\r\nthat they wished to get it through on its merits, and invited the\r\nmost careful examination. I looked carefully into it, found that the\r\nmunicipal authorities and the property-owners whose property was to be\r\ntaken favored it, and also found that it was an absolute necessity\r\nfrom the standpoint of the city no less than from the standpoint of the\r\nrailway. So I said I would take charge of it if I had guarantees that no\r\nmoney should be used and nothing improper done in order to push it. This\r\nwas agreed to. I was then acting as chairman of the committee before\r\nwhich the bill went.\r\n\r\nA very brief experience proved what I had already been practically sure\r\nof, that there was a secret combination of the majority of the committee\r\non a crooked basis. On one pretext or another the crooked members of the\r\ncommittee held the bill up, refusing to report it either favorably or\r\nunfavorably. There were one or two members of the committee who were\r\npretty rough characters, and when I decided to force matters I was not\r\nsure that we would not have trouble. There was a broken chair in the\r\nroom, and I got a leg of it loose and put it down beside me where it\r\nwas not visible, but where I might get at it in a hurry if necessary. I\r\nmoved that the bill be reported favorably. This was voted down without\r\ndebate by the \"combine,\" some of whom kept a wooden stolidity of look,\r\nwhile others leered at me with sneering insolence. I then moved that it\r\nbe reported unfavorably, and again the motion was voted down by the same\r\nmajority and in the same fashion. I then put the bill in my pocket and\r\nannounced that I would report it anyhow. This almost precipitated a\r\nriot, especially when I explained, in answer to statements that my\r\nconduct would be exposed on the floor of the Legislature, that in that\r\ncase I should give the Legislature the reasons why I suspected that the\r\nmen holding up all report of the bill were holding it up for purposes\r\nof blackmail. The riot did not come off; partly, I think, because the\r\nopportune production of the chair-leg had a sedative effect, and partly\r\nowing to wise counsels from one or two of my opponents.\r\n\r\nAccordingly I got the bill reported to the Legislature and put on the\r\ncalendar. But here it came to a dead halt. I think this was chiefly\r\nbecause most of the newspapers which noticed the matter at all treated\r\nit in such a cynical spirit as to encourage the men who wished to\r\nblackmail. These papers reported the introduction of the bill, and said\r\nthat \"all the hungry legislators were clamoring for their share of the\r\npie\"; and they accepted as certain the fact that there was going to be a\r\ndivision of \"pie.\" This succeeded in frightening honest men, and also in\r\nrelieving the rogues; the former were afraid they would be suspected of\r\nreceiving money if they voted for the bill, and the latter were given a\r\nshield behind which to stand until they were paid. I was wholly\r\nunable to move the bill forward in the Legislature, and finally a\r\nrepresentative of the railway told me that he thought he would like\r\nto take the bill out of my hands, that I did not seem able to get it\r\nthrough, and that perhaps some \"older and more experienced\" leader could\r\nbe more successful. I was pretty certain what this meant, but of course\r\nI had no kind of proof, and moreover I was not in a position to say that\r\nI could promise success. Accordingly, the bill was given into the charge\r\nof a veteran, whom I believe to have been a personally honest man, but\r\nwho was not inquisitive about the motives influencing his colleagues.\r\nThis gentleman, who went by a nickname which I shall incorrectly call\r\n\"the bald eagle of Weehawken,\" was efficient and knew his job. After a\r\ncouple of weeks a motion to put the bill through was made by \"the\r\nbald eagle\"; the \"black horse cavalry,\" whose feelings had undergone a\r\ncomplete change in the intervening time, voted unanimously for it, in\r\ncompany with all the decent members; and that was the end. Now here was\r\na bit of work in the interest of a corporation and in the interest of\r\na community, which the corporation at first tried honestly to have put\r\nthrough on its merits. The blame for the failure lay primarily in the\r\nsupine indifference of the community to legislative wrong-doing, so long\r\nas only the corporations were blackmailed.\r\n\r\nExcept as above mentioned, I was not brought in contact with big\r\nbusiness, save in the effort to impeach a certain judge. This judge\r\nhad been used as an instrument in their business by certain of the men\r\nconnected with the elevated railways and other great corporations at\r\nthat time. We got hold of his correspondence with one of these men, and\r\nit showed a shocking willingness to use the judicial office in any way\r\nthat one of the kings of finance of that day desired. He had actually\r\nheld court in one of that financier's rooms. One expression in one of\r\nthe judge's letters to this financier I shall always remember: \"I am\r\nwilling to go to the very verge of judicial discretion to serve your\r\nvast interests.\" The curious thing was that I was by no means certain\r\nthat the judge himself was corrupt. He may have been; but I am inclined\r\nto think that, aside from his being a man of coarse moral fiber, the\r\ntrouble lay chiefly in the fact that he had a genuine--if I had not\r\nso often seen it, I would say a wholly inexplicable--reverence for\r\nthe possessor of a great fortune as such. He sincerely believed that\r\nbusiness was the end of existence, and that judge and legislator\r\nalike should do whatever was necessary to favor it; and the bigger the\r\nbusiness the more he desired to favor it. Big business of the kind that\r\nis allied with politics thoroughly appreciated the usefulness of such a\r\njudge, and every effort was strained to protect him. We fought hard--by\r\n\"we\" I mean some thirty or forty legislators, both Republicans and\r\nDemocrats--but the \"black horse cavalry,\" and the timid good men, and\r\nthe dull conservative men, were all against us; and the vote in the\r\nLegislature was heavily against impeachment. The minority of the\r\ncommittee that investigated him, with Chapin at its head, recommended\r\nimpeachment; the argument for impeachment before the committee was made\r\nby Francis Lynde Stetson.\r\n\r\nIt was my first experience of the kind. Various men whom I had known\r\nwell socially and had been taught to look up to, prominent business men\r\nand lawyers, acted in a way which not only astounded me, but which I\r\nwas quite unable to reconcile with the theories I had formed as to their\r\nhigh standing--I was little more than a year out of college at the time.\r\nGenerally, as has been always the case since, they were careful to avoid\r\nany direct conversation with me on a concrete case of what we now\r\ncall \"privilege\" in business and in politics, that is, of the alliance\r\nbetween business and politics which represents improper favors rendered\r\nto some men in return for improper conduct on the part of others being\r\nignored or permitted.\r\n\r\nOne member of a prominent law firm, an old family friend, did, however,\r\ntake me out to lunch one day, evidently for the purpose of seeing just\r\nwhat it was that I wished and intended to do. I believe he had a\r\ngenuine personal liking for me. He explained that I had done well in the\r\nLegislature; that it was a good thing to have made the \"reform play,\"\r\nthat I had shown that I possessed ability such as would make me useful\r\nin the right kind of law office or business concern; but that I must not\r\noverplay my hand; that I had gone far enough, and that now was the time\r\nto leave politics and identify myself with the right kind of people, the\r\npeople who would always in the long run control others and obtain the\r\nreal rewards which were worth having. I asked him if that meant that I\r\nwas to yield to the ring in politics. He answered somewhat impatiently\r\nthat I was entirely mistaken (as in fact I was) about there being merely\r\na political ring, of the kind of which the papers were fond of talking;\r\nthat the \"ring,\" if it could be called such--that is, the inner\r\ncircle--included certain big business men, and the politicians, lawyers,\r\nand judges who were in alliance with and to a certain extent dependent\r\nupon them, and that the successful man had to win his success by the\r\nbacking of the same forces, whether in law, business, or politics.\r\n\r\nThis conversation not only interested me, but made such an impression\r\nthat I always remembered it, for it was the first glimpse I had of that\r\ncombination between business and politics which I was in after years so\r\noften to oppose. In the America of that day, and especially among\r\nthe people whom I knew, the successful business man was regarded by\r\neverybody as preeminently the good citizen. The orthodox books on\r\npolitical economy, not only in America but in England, were written\r\nfor his especial glorification. The tangible rewards came to him, the\r\nadmiration of his fellow-citizens of the respectable type was apt to\r\nbe his, and the severe newspaper moralists who were never tired of\r\ndenouncing politicians and political methods were wont to hold up\r\n\"business methods\" as the ideal which we were to strive to introduce\r\ninto political life. Herbert Croly, in \"The Promise of American Life,\"\r\nhas set forth the reasons why our individualistic democracy--which\r\ntaught that each man was to rely exclusively on himself, was in no way\r\nto be interfered with by others, and was to devote himself to his own\r\npersonal welfare--necessarily produced the type of business man\r\nwho sincerely believed, as did the rest of the community, that the\r\nindividual who amassed a big fortune was the man who was the best and\r\nmost typical American.\r\n\r\nIn the Legislature the problems with which I dealt were mainly problems\r\nof honesty and decency and of legislative and administrative efficiency.\r\nThey represented the effort, the wise, the vitally necessary effort, to\r\nget efficient and honest government. But as yet I understood little of\r\nthe effort which was already beginning, for the most part under very bad\r\nleadership, to secure a more genuine social and industrial justice. Nor\r\nwas I especially to blame for this. The good citizens I then knew best,\r\neven when themselves men of limited means--men like my colleague Billy\r\nO'Neill, and my backwoods friends Sewall and Dow--were no more awake\r\nthan I was to the changing needs the changing times were bringing.\r\nTheir outlook was as narrow as my own, and, within its limits, as\r\nfundamentally sound.\r\n\r\nI wish to dwell on the soundness of our outlook on life, even though as\r\nyet it was not broad enough. We were no respecters of persons. Where our\r\nvision was developed to a degree that enabled us to see crookedness, we\r\nopposed it whether in great or small. As a matter of fact, we found that\r\nit needed much more courage to stand up openly against labor men when\r\nthey were wrong than against capitalists when they were wrong. The\r\nsins against labor are usually committed, and the improper services to\r\ncapitalists are usually rendered, behind closed doors. Very often the\r\nman with the moral courage to speak in the open against labor when it is\r\nwrong is the only man anxious to do effective work for labor when labor\r\nis right.\r\n\r\nThe only kinds of courage and honesty which are permanently useful to\r\ngood institutions anywhere are those shown by men who decide all cases\r\nwith impartial justice on grounds of conduct and not on grounds of\r\nclass. We found that in the long run the men who in public blatantly\r\ninsisted that labor was never wrong were the very men who in private\r\ncould not be trusted to stand for labor when it was right. We grew\r\nheartily to distrust the reformer who never denounced wickedness unless\r\nit was embodied in a rich man. Human nature does not change; and that\r\ntype of \"reformer\" is as noxious now as he ever was. The loud-mouthed\r\nupholder of popular rights who attacks wickedness only when it is allied\r\nwith wealth, and who never publicly assails any misdeed, no matter how\r\nflagrant, if committed nominally in the interest of labor, has either a\r\nwarped mind or a tainted soul, and should be trusted by no honest man.\r\nIt was largely the indignant and contemptuous dislike aroused in our\r\nminds by the demagogues of this class which then prevented those of us\r\nwhose instincts at bottom were sound from going as far as we ought to\r\nhave gone along the lines of governmental control of corporations and\r\ngovernmental interference on behalf of labor.\r\n\r\nI did, however, have one exceedingly useful experience. A bill was\r\nintroduced by the Cigar-Makers' Union to prohibit the manufacture of\r\ncigars in tenement-houses. I was appointed one of a committee of three\r\nto investigate conditions in the tenement-houses and see if legislation\r\nshould be had. Of my two colleagues on the committee, one took no\r\ninterest in the measure and privately said he did not think it was\r\nright, but that he had to vote for it because the labor unions were\r\nstrong in his district and he was pledged to support the bill. The\r\nother, a sporting Tammany man who afterwards abandoned politics for the\r\nrace-track, was a very good fellow. He told me frankly that he had to be\r\nagainst the bill because certain interests which were all-powerful and\r\nwith which he had dealings required him to be against it, but that I\r\nwas a free agent, and that if I would look into the matter he believed I\r\nwould favor the legislation. As a matter of fact, I had supposed I would\r\nbe against the legislation, and I rather think that I was put on the\r\ncommittee with that idea, for the respectable people I knew were against\r\nit; it was contrary to the principles of political economy of the\r\n_laissez-faire_ kind; and the business men who spoke to me about it\r\nshook their heads and said that it was designed to prevent a man doing\r\nas he wished and as he had a right to do with what was his own.\r\n\r\nHowever, my first visits to the tenement-house districts in question\r\nmade me feel that, whatever the theories might be, as a matter of\r\npractical common sense I could not conscientiously vote for the\r\ncontinuance of the conditions which I saw. These conditions rendered\r\nit impossible for the families of the tenement-house workers to live\r\nso that the children might grow up fitted for the exacting duties\r\nof American citizenship. I visited the tenement-houses once with\r\nmy colleagues of the committee, once with some of the labor union\r\nrepresentatives, and once or twice by myself. In a few of the\r\ntenement-houses there were suites of rooms ample in number where the\r\nwork on the tobacco was done in rooms not occupied for cooking or\r\nsleeping or living. In the overwhelming majority of cases, however,\r\nthere were one, two, or three room apartments, and the work of\r\nmanufacturing the tobacco by men, women, and children went on day and\r\nnight in the eating, living, and sleeping rooms--sometimes in one room.\r\nI have always remembered one room in which two families were living. On\r\nmy inquiry as to who the third adult male was I was told that he was\r\na boarder with one of the families. There were several children,\r\nthree men, and two women in this room. The tobacco was stowed about\r\neverywhere, alongside the foul bedding, and in a corner where there were\r\nscraps of food. The men, women, and children in this room worked by day\r\nand far on into the evening, and they slept and ate there. They were\r\nBohemians, unable to speak English, except that one of the children knew\r\nenough to act as interpreter.\r\n\r\nInstead of opposing the bill I ardently championed it. It was a poorly\r\ndrawn measure, and the Governor, Grover Cleveland, was at first doubtful\r\nabout signing it. The Cigar-makers' Union then asked me to appear before\r\nthe Governor and argue for it. I accordingly did so, acting as spokesman\r\nfor the battered, undersized foreigners who represented the Union\r\nand the workers. The Governor signed the bill. Afterwards this\r\ntenement-house cigar legislation was declared invalid by the Court\r\nof Appeals in the Jacobs decision. Jacobs was one of the rare\r\ntenement-house manufacturers of cigars who occupied quite a suite\r\nof rooms, so that in his case the living conditions were altogether\r\nexceptional. What the reason was which influenced those bringing the\r\nsuit to select the exceptional instead of the average worker I do not\r\nknow; of course such action was precisely the action which those most\r\ninterested in having the law broken down were anxious to see taken.\r\nThe Court of Appeals declared the law unconstitutional, and in their\r\ndecision the judges reprobated the law as an assault upon the \"hallowed\"\r\ninfluences of \"home.\" It was this case which first waked me to a dim and\r\npartial understanding of the fact that the courts were not necessarily\r\nthe best judges of what should be done to better social and industrial\r\nconditions. The judges who rendered this decision were well-meaning\r\nmen. They knew nothing whatever of tenement-house conditions; they\r\nknew nothing whatever of the needs, or of the life and labor, of\r\nthree-fourths of their fellow-citizens in great cities. They knew\r\nlegalism, but not life. Their choice of the words \"hallowed\" and \"home,\"\r\nas applicable to the revolting conditions attending the manufacture of\r\ncigars in tenement-houses, showed that they had no idea what it was\r\nthat they were deciding. Imagine the \"hallowed\" associations of a \"home\"\r\nconsisting of one room where two families, one of them with a boarder,\r\nlive, eat, and work! This decision completely blocked tenement-house\r\nreform legislation in New York for a score of years, and hampers it to\r\nthis day. It was one of the most serious setbacks which the cause of\r\nindustrial and social progress and reform ever received.\r\n\r\nI had been brought up to hold the courts in especial reverence. The\r\npeople with whom I was most intimate were apt to praise the courts for\r\njust such decisions as this, and to speak of them as bulwarks against\r\ndisorder and barriers against demagogic legislation. These were the same\r\npeople with whom the judges who rendered these decisions were apt\r\nto foregather at social clubs, or dinners, or in private life. Very\r\nnaturally they all tended to look at things from the same standpoint. Of\r\ncourse it took more than one experience such as this Tenement Cigar Case\r\nto shake me out of the attitude in which I was brought up. But various\r\ndecisions, not only of the New York court but of certain other State\r\ncourts and even of the United States Supreme Court, during the quarter\r\nof a century following the passage of this tenement-house legislation,\r\ndid at last thoroughly wake me to the actual fact. I grew to realize\r\nthat all that Abraham Lincoln had said about the Dred Scott decision\r\ncould be said with equal truth and justice about the numerous decisions\r\nwhich in our own day were erected as bars across the path of social\r\nreform, and which brought to naught so much of the effort to secure\r\njustice and fair dealing for workingmen and workingwomen, and for plain\r\ncitizens generally.\r\n\r\nSome of the wickedness and inefficiency in public life was then\r\ndisplayed in simpler fashion than would probably now be the case. Once\r\nor twice I was a member of committees which looked into gross and widely\r\nramifying governmental abuses. On the whole, the most important part I\r\nplayed was in the third Legislature in which I served, when I acted as\r\nchairman of a committee which investigated various phases of New York\r\nCity official life.\r\n\r\nThe most important of the reform measures our committee recommended was\r\nthe bill taking away from the Aldermen their power of confirmation over\r\nthe Mayor's appointments. We found that it was possible to get citizens\r\ninterested in the character and capacity of the head of the city, so\r\nthat they would exercise some intelligent interest in his conduct and\r\nqualifications. But we found that as a matter of fact it was impossible\r\nto get them interested in the Aldermen and other subordinate officers.\r\nIn actual practice the Aldermen were merely the creatures of the local\r\nward bosses or of the big municipal bosses, and where they controlled\r\nthe appointments the citizens at large had no chance whatever to make\r\ntheir will felt. Accordingly we fought for the principle, which I\r\nbelieve to be of universal application, that what is needed in our\r\npopular government is to give plenty of power to a few officials, and to\r\nmake these few officials genuinely and readily responsible to the people\r\nfor the exercise of that power. Taking away the confirming power of the\r\nBoard of Aldermen did not give the citizens of New York good government.\r\nWe knew that if they chose to elect the wrong kind of Mayor they would\r\nhave bad government, no matter what the form of the law was. But we did\r\nsecure to them the chance to get good government if they desired, and\r\nthis was impossible as long as the old system remained. The change was\r\nfought in the way in which all similar changes always are fought. The\r\ncorrupt and interested politicians were against it, and the battle-cries\r\nthey used, which rallied to them most of the unthinking conservatives,\r\nwere that we were changing the old constitutional system, that we were\r\ndefacing the monuments of the wisdom of the founders of the government,\r\nthat we were destroying that distinction between legislative and\r\nexecutive power which was the bulwark of our liberties, and that we were\r\nviolent and unscrupulous radicals with no reverence for the past.\r\n\r\nOf course the investigations, disclosures, and proceedings of the\r\ninvestigating committee of which I was chairman brought me into\r\nbitter personal conflict with very powerful financiers, very powerful\r\npoliticians, and with certain newspapers which these financiers and\r\npoliticians controlled. A number of able and unscrupulous men were\r\nfighting, some for their financial lives, and others to keep out of\r\nunpleasantly close neighborhood to State's prison. This meant that there\r\nwere blows to be taken as well as given. In such political struggles,\r\nthose who went in for the kind of thing that I did speedily excited\r\nanimosities among strong and cunning men who would stop at little to\r\ngratify their animosity. Any man engaged in this particular type of\r\nmilitant and practical reform movement was soon made to feel that he had\r\nbetter not undertake to push matters home unless his own character was\r\nunassailable. On one of the investigating committees on which I served\r\nthere was a countryman, a very able man, who, when he reached New York\r\nCity, felt as certain Americans do when they go to Paris--that the moral\r\nrestraints of his native place no longer applied. With all his ability,\r\nhe was not shrewd enough to realize that the Police Department was\r\nhaving him as well as the rest of us carefully shadowed. He was caught\r\nred-handed by a plain-clothes man doing what he had no business to do;\r\nand from that time on he dared not act save as those who held his secret\r\npermitted him to act. Thenceforth those officials who stood behind the\r\nPolice Department had one man on the committee on whom they could count.\r\nI never saw terror more ghastly on a strong man's face than on the face\r\nof this man on one or two occasions when he feared that events in the\r\ncommittee might take such a course as to force him into a position where\r\nhis colleagues would expose him even if the city officials did not.\r\nHowever, he escaped, for we were never able to get the kind of proof\r\nwhich would warrant our asking for the action in which this man could\r\nnot have joined.\r\n\r\nTraps were set for more than one of us, and if we had walked into these\r\ntraps our public careers would have ended, at least so far as following\r\nthem under the conditions which alone make it worth while to be in\r\npublic life at all. A man can of course hold public office, and many a\r\nman does hold public office, and lead a public career of a sort, even if\r\nthere are other men who possess secrets about him which he cannot afford\r\nto have divulged. But no man can lead a public career really worth\r\nleading, no man can act with rugged independence in serious crises, nor\r\nstrike at great abuses, nor afford to make powerful and unscrupulous\r\nfoes, if he is himself vulnerable in his private character. Nor will\r\nclean conduct by itself enable a man to render good service. I have\r\nalways been fond of Josh Billings's remark that \"it is much easier to\r\nbe a harmless dove than a wise serpent.\" There are plenty of decent\r\nlegislators, and plenty of able legislators; but the blamelessness and\r\nthe fighting edge are not always combined. Both qualities are necessary\r\nfor the man who is to wage active battle against the powers that prey.\r\nHe must be clean of life, so that he can laugh when his public or his\r\nprivate record is searched; and yet being clean of life will not\r\navail him if he is either foolish or timid. He must walk warily and\r\nfearlessly, and while he should never brawl if he can avoid it, he must\r\nbe ready to hit hard if the need arises. Let him remember, by the way,\r\nthat the unforgivable crime is soft hitting. Do not hit at all if it can\r\nbe avoided; but never hit softly.\r\n\r\nLike most young men in politics, I went through various oscillations\r\nof feeling before I \"found myself.\" At one period I became so impressed\r\nwith the virtue of complete independence that I proceeded to act on each\r\ncase purely as I personally viewed it, without paying any heed to the\r\nprinciples and prejudices of others. The result was that I speedily\r\nand deservedly lost all power of accomplishing anything at all; and I\r\nthereby learned the invaluable lesson that in the practical activities\r\nof life no man can render the highest service unless he can act\r\nin combination with his fellows, which means a certain amount of\r\ngive-and-take between him and them. Again, I at one period began to\r\nbelieve that I had a future before me, and that it behooved me to be\r\nvery far-sighted and scan each action carefully with a view to its\r\npossible effect on that future. This speedily made me useless to the\r\npublic and an object of aversion to myself; and I then made up my mind\r\nthat I would try not to think of the future at all, but would proceed on\r\nthe assumption that each office I held would be the last I ever should\r\nhold, and that I would confine myself to trying to do my work as well as\r\npossible while I held that office. I found that for me personally this\r\nwas the only way in which I could either enjoy myself or render good\r\nservice to the country, and I never afterwards deviated from this plan.\r\n\r\nAs regards political advancement the bosses could of course do a good\r\ndeal. At that time the warring Stalwart and Half-Breed factions of\r\nthe Republican party were supporting respectively President Arthur\r\nand Senator Miller. Neither side cared for me. The first year in the\r\nLegislature I rose to a position of leadership, so that in the second\r\nyear, when the Republicans were in a minority, I received the minority\r\nnomination for Speaker, although I was still the youngest man in the\r\nHouse, being twenty-four years old. The third year the Republicans\r\ncarried the Legislature, and the bosses at once took a hand in the\r\nSpeakership contest. I made a stout fight for the nomination, but the\r\nbosses of the two factions, the Stalwarts and the Half-Breeds, combined\r\nand I was beaten. I was much chagrined for the moment. But the fact that\r\nI had fought hard and efficiently, even though defeated, and that I had\r\nmade the fight single-handed, with no machine back of me, assured my\r\nstanding as floor leader. My defeat in the end materially strengthened\r\nmy position, and enabled me to accomplish far more than I could have\r\naccomplished as Speaker. As so often, I found that the titular\r\nposition was of no consequence; what counted was the combination of the\r\nopportunity with the ability to accomplish results. The achievement was\r\nthe all-important thing; the position, whether titularly high or\r\nlow, was of consequence only in so far as it widened the chance for\r\nachievement. After the session closed four of us who looked at politics\r\nfrom the same standpoint and were known as Independent or Anti-Machine\r\nRepublicans were sent by the State Convention as delegates-at-large\r\nto the Republican National Convention of 1884, where I advocated, as\r\nvigorously as I knew how, the nomination of Senator George F. Edmunds.\r\nMr. Edmunds was defeated and Mr. Blaine nominated. Mr. Blaine was\r\nclearly the choice of the rank and file of the party; his nomination\r\nwas won in fair and aboveboard fashion, because the rank and file of the\r\nparty stood back of him; and I supported him to the best of my ability\r\nin the ensuing campaign.\r\n\r\nThe Speakership contest enlightened me as regards more things than the\r\nattitude of the bosses. I had already had some exasperating experiences\r\nwith the \"silk stocking\" reformer type, as Abraham Lincoln called it,\r\nthe gentlemen who were very nice, very refined, who shook their heads\r\nover political corruption and discussed it in drawing-rooms and parlors,\r\nbut who were wholly unable to grapple with real men in real life. They\r\nwere apt vociferously to demand \"reform\" as if it were some concrete\r\nsubstance, like cake, which could be handed out at will, in tangible\r\nmasses, if only the demand were urgent enough. These parlor reformers\r\nmade up for inefficiency in action by zeal in criticising; and they\r\ndelighted in criticising the men who really were doing the things which\r\nthey said ought to be done, but which they lacked the sinewy power to\r\ndo. They often upheld ideals which were not merely impossible but highly\r\nundesirable, and thereby played into the hands of the very politicians\r\nto whom they professed to be most hostile. Moreover, if they believed\r\nthat their own interests, individually or as a class, were jeoparded,\r\nthey were apt to show no higher standards than did the men they usually\r\ndenounced.\r\n\r\nOne of their shibboleths was that the office should seek the man and not\r\nthe man the office. This is entirely true of certain offices at certain\r\ntimes. It is entirely untrue when the circumstances are different.\r\nIt would have been unnecessary and undesirable for Washington to\r\nhave sought the Presidency. But if Abraham Lincoln had not sought the\r\nPresidency he never would have been nominated. The objection in such a\r\ncase as this lies not to seeking the office, but to seeking it in any\r\nbut an honorable and proper manner. The effect of the shibboleth in\r\nquestion is usually merely to put a premium on hypocrisy, and therefore\r\nto favor the creature who is willing to rise by hypocrisy. When I ran\r\nfor Speaker, the whole body of machine politicians was against me, and\r\nmy only chance lay in arousing the people in the different districts. To\r\ndo this I had to visit the districts, put the case fairly before the men\r\nwhom I saw, and make them understand that I was really making a fight\r\nand would stay in the fight to the end. Yet there were reformers who\r\nshook their heads and deplored my \"activity\" in the canvass. Of course\r\nthe one thing which corrupt machine politicians most desire is to have\r\ndecent men frown on the activity, that is, on the efficiency, of the\r\nhonest man who genuinely wishes to reform politics.\r\n\r\nIf efficiency is left solely to bad men, and if virtue is confined\r\nsolely to inefficient men, the result cannot be happy. When I entered\r\npolitics there were, as there always had been--and as there always will\r\nbe--any number of bad men in politics who were thoroughly efficient,\r\nand any number of good men who would like to have done lofty things in\r\npolitics but who were thoroughly inefficient. If I wished to accomplish\r\nanything for the country, my business was to combine decency and\r\nefficiency; to be a thoroughly practical man of high ideals who did his\r\nbest to reduce those ideals to actual practice. This was my ideal, and\r\nto the best of my ability I strove to live up to it.\r\n\r\nTo a young man, life in the New York Legislature was always interesting\r\nand often entertaining. There was always a struggle of some kind on\r\nhand. Sometimes it was on a naked question of right and wrong. Sometimes\r\nit was on a question of real constructive statesmanship. Moreover, there\r\nwere all kinds of humorous incidents, the humor being usually of the\r\nunconscious kind. In one session of the Legislature the New York City\r\nDemocratic representatives were split into two camps, and there were\r\ntwo rivals for leadership. One of these was a thoroughly good-hearted,\r\nhappy-go-lucky person who was afterwards for several years in Congress.\r\nHe had been a local magistrate and was called Judge. Generally he and I\r\nwere friendly, but occasionally I did something that irritated him. He\r\nwas always willing to vote for any other member's bill himself, and he\r\nregarded it as narrow-minded for any one to oppose one of his\r\nbills, especially if the opposition was upon the ground that it was\r\nunconstitutional--for his views of the Constitution were so excessively\r\nliberal as to make even me feel as if I belonged to the straitest sect\r\nof strict constructionists. On one occasion he had a bill to appropriate\r\nmoney, with obvious impropriety, for the relief of some miscreant whom\r\nhe styled \"one of the honest yeomanry of the State.\" When I explained to\r\nhim that it was clearly unconstitutional, he answered, \"Me friend, the\r\nConstitution don't touch little things like that,\" and then added, with\r\nan ingratiating smile, \"Anyhow, I'd never allow the Constitution to\r\ncome between friends.\" At the time I was looking over the proofs of Mr.\r\nBryce's \"American Commonwealth,\" and I told him the incident. He put it\r\ninto the first edition of the \"Commonwealth\"; whether it is in the last\r\nedition or not, I cannot say.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion the same gentleman came to an issue with me in\r\na debate, and wound up his speech by explaining that I occupied what\r\n\"lawyers would call a quasi position on the bill.\" His rival was a man\r\nof totally different type, a man of great natural dignity, also born in\r\nIreland. He had served with gallantry in the Civil War. After the close\r\nof the war he organized an expedition to conquer Canada. The expedition,\r\nhowever, got so drunk before reaching Albany that it was there\r\nincarcerated in jail, whereupon its leader abandoned it and went into\r\nNew York politics instead. He was a man of influence, and later occupied\r\nin the Police Department the same position as Commissioner which I\r\nmyself at one time occupied. He felt that his rival had gained too much\r\nglory at my expense, and, walking over with ceremonious solemnity to\r\nwhere the said rival was sitting close beside me, he said to him: \"I\r\nwould like you to know, Mr. Cameron [Cameron, of course, was not the\r\nreal name], that Mr. Roosevelt knows more law in a wake than you do in a\r\nmonth; and, more than that, Michael Cameron, what do you mane by quoting\r\nLatin on the floor of this House when you don't know the alpha and\r\nomayga of the language?\"\r\n\r\nThere was in the Legislature, during the deadlock above mentioned, a man\r\nwhom I will call Brogan. He looked like a serious elderly frog. I\r\nnever heard him speak more than once. It was before the Legislature was\r\norganized, or had adopted any rules; and each day the only business was\r\nfor the clerk to call the roll. One day Brogan suddenly rose, and the\r\nfollowing dialogue occurred:\r\n\r\n     Brogan.    Misther Clu-r-r-k!\r\n     The Clerk. The gentleman from New York.\r\n     Brogan.    I rise to a point of ordher under the rules!\r\n     The Clerk. There are no rules.\r\n     Brogan.    Thin I object to them!\r\n     The Clerk. There are no rules to object to.\r\n     Brogan.    Oh! [nonplussed; but immediately recovering himself].\r\n     Thin I move that they be amended until there ar-r-re!\r\n\r\nThe deadlock was tedious; and we hailed with joy such enlivening\r\nincidents as the above.\r\n\r\nDuring my three years' service in the Legislature I worked on a very\r\nsimple philosophy of government. It was that personal character and\r\ninitiative are the prime requisites in political and social life. It\r\nwas not only a good but an absolutely indispensable theory as far as it\r\nwent; but it was defective in that it did not sufficiently allow for\r\nthe need of collective action. I shall never forget the men with whom\r\nI worked hand in hand in these legislative struggles, not only my\r\nfellow-legislators, but some of the newspaper reporters, such as Spinney\r\nand Cunningham; and then in addition the men in the various districts\r\nwho helped us. We had made up our minds that we must not fight fire with\r\nfire, that on the contrary the way to win out was to equal our foes in\r\npractical efficiency and yet to stand at the opposite plane from them in\r\napplied morality.\r\n\r\nIt was not always easy to keep the just middle, especially when\r\nit happened that on one side there were corrupt and unscrupulous\r\ndemagogues, and on the other side corrupt and unscrupulous\r\nreactionaries. Our effort was to hold the scales even between both. We\r\ntried to stand with the cause of righteousness even though its advocates\r\nwere anything but righteous. We endeavored to cut out the abuses of\r\nproperty, even though good men of property were misled into upholding\r\nthose abuses. We refused to be frightened into sanctioning improper\r\nassaults upon property, although we knew that the champions of property\r\nthemselves did things that were wicked and corrupt. We were as yet by\r\nno means as thoroughly awake as we ought to have been to the need of\r\ncontrolling big business and to the damage done by the combination of\r\npolitics with big business. In this matter I was not behind the rest\r\nof my friends; indeed, I was ahead of them, for no serious leader in\r\npolitical life then appreciated the prime need of grappling with these\r\nquestions. One partial reason--not an excuse or a justification, but a\r\npartial reason--for my slowness in grasping the importance of action in\r\nthese matters was the corrupt and unattractive nature of so many of the\r\nmen who championed popular reforms, their insincerity, and the folly\r\nof so many of the actions which they advocated. Even at that date I had\r\nneither sympathy with nor admiration for the man who was merely a money\r\nking, and I did not regard the \"money touch,\" when divorced from other\r\nqualities, as entitling a man to either respect or consideration. As\r\nrecited above, we did on more than one occasion fight battles, in\r\nwhich we neither took nor gave quarter, against the most prominent and\r\npowerful financiers and financial interests of the day. But most of the\r\nfights in which we were engaged were for pure honesty and decency, and\r\nthey were more apt to be against that form of corruption which found\r\nits expression in demagogy than against that form of corruption which\r\ndefended or advocated privilege. Fundamentally, our fight was part of\r\nthe eternal war against the Powers that Prey; and we cared not a whit in\r\nwhat rank of life these powers were found.\r\n\r\nTo play the demagogue for purposes of self-interest is a cardinal sin\r\nagainst the people in a democracy, exactly as to play the courtier for\r\nsuch purposes is a cardinal sin against the people under other forms of\r\ngovernment. A man who stays long in our American political life, if he\r\nhas in his soul the generous desire to do effective service for great\r\ncauses, inevitably grows to regard himself merely as one of many\r\ninstruments, all of which it may be necessary to use, one at one time,\r\none at another, in achieving the triumph of those causes; and whenever\r\nthe usefulness of any one has been exhausted, it is to be thrown aside.\r\nIf such a man is wise, he will gladly do the thing that is next, when\r\nthe time and the need come together, without asking what the future\r\nholds for him. Let the half-god play his part well and manfully, and\r\nthen be content to draw aside when the god appears. Nor should he feel\r\nvain regrets that to another it is given to render greater services and\r\nreap a greater reward. Let it be enough for him that he too has served,\r\nand that by doing well he has prepared the way for the other man who can\r\ndo better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nIN COWBOY LAND\r\n\r\nThough I had previously made a trip into the then Territory of Dakota,\r\nbeyond the Red River, it was not until 1883 that I went to the Little\r\nMissouri, and there took hold of two cattle ranches, the Chimney Butte\r\nand the Elkhorn.\r\n\r\nIt was still the Wild West in those days, the Far West, the West of\r\nOwen Wister's stories and Frederic Remington's drawings, the West of\r\nthe Indian and the buffalo-hunter, the soldier and the cow-puncher. That\r\nland of the West has gone now, \"gone, gone with lost Atlantis,\" gone to\r\nthe isle of ghosts and of strange dead memories. It was a land of vast\r\nsilent spaces, of lonely rivers, and of plains where the wild game\r\nstared at the passing horseman. It was a land of scattered ranches, of\r\nherds of long-horned cattle, and of reckless riders who unmoved looked\r\nin the eyes of life or of death. In that land we led a free and hardy\r\nlife, with horse and with rifle. We worked under the scorching midsummer\r\nsun, when the wide plains shimmered and wavered in the heat; and we knew\r\nthe freezing misery of riding night guard round the cattle in the late\r\nfall round-up. In the soft springtime the stars were glorious in our\r\neyes each night before we fell asleep; and in the winter we rode through\r\nblinding blizzards, when the driven snow-dust burned our faces. There\r\nwere monotonous days, as we guided the trail cattle or the beef herds,\r\nhour after hour, at the slowest of walks; and minutes or hours teeming\r\nwith excitement as we stopped stampedes or swam the herds across rivers\r\ntreacherous with quicksands or brimmed with running ice. We knew toil\r\nand hardship and hunger and thirst; and we saw men die violent deaths\r\nas they worked among the horses and cattle, or fought in evil feuds with\r\none another; but we felt the beat of hardy life in our veins, and ours\r\nwas the glory of work and the joy of living.\r\n\r\nIt was right and necessary that this life should pass, for the safety of\r\nour country lies in its being made the country of the small home-maker.\r\nThe great unfenced ranches, in the days of \"free grass,\" necessarily\r\nrepresented a temporary stage in our history. The large migratory flocks\r\nof sheep, each guarded by the hired shepherds of absentee owners, were\r\nthe first enemies of the cattlemen; and owing to the way they ate out\r\nthe grass and destroyed all other vegetation, these roving sheep\r\nbands represented little of permanent good to the country. But the\r\nhomesteaders, the permanent settlers, the men who took up each his own\r\nfarm on which he lived and brought up his family, these represented from\r\nthe National standpoint the most desirable of all possible users of,\r\nand dwellers on, the soil. Their advent meant the breaking up of the big\r\nranches; and the change was a National gain, although to some of us an\r\nindividual loss.\r\n\r\nI first reached the Little Missouri on a Northern Pacific train about\r\nthree in the morning of a cool September day in 1883. Aside from the\r\nstation, the only building was a ramshackle structure called the Pyramid\r\nPark Hotel. I dragged my duffle-bag thither, and hammered at the door\r\nuntil the frowsy proprietor appeared, muttering oaths. He ushered me\r\nupstairs, where I was given one of the fourteen beds in the room which\r\nby itself constituted the entire upper floor. Next day I walked over\r\nto the abandoned army post, and, after some hours among the gray log\r\nshacks, a ranchman who had driven into the station agreed to take me\r\nout to his ranch, the Chimney Butte ranch, where he was living with his\r\nbrother and their partner.\r\n\r\nThe ranch was a log structure with a dirt roof, a corral for the horses\r\nnear by, and a chicken-house jabbed against the rear of the ranch house.\r\nInside there was only one room, with a table, three or four chairs, a\r\ncooking-stove, and three bunks. The owners were Sylvane and Joe Ferris\r\nand William J. Merrifield. Later all three of them held my commissions\r\nwhile I was President. Merrifield was Marshal of Montana, and as\r\nPresidential elector cast the vote of that State for me in 1904; Sylvane\r\nFerris was Land Officer in North Dakota, and Joe Ferris Postmaster at\r\nMedora. There was a fourth man, George Meyer, who also worked for me\r\nlater. That evening we all played old sledge round the table, and at one\r\nperiod the game was interrupted by a frightful squawking outside which\r\ntold us that a bobcat had made a raid on the chicken-house.\r\n\r\nAfter a buffalo hunt with my original friend, Joe Ferris, I entered into\r\npartnership with Merrifield and Sylvane Ferris, and we started a cow\r\nranch, with the maltese cross brand--always known as \"maltee cross,\" by\r\nthe way, as the general impression along the Little Missouri was that\r\n\"maltese\" must be a plural. Twenty-nine years later my four friends of\r\nthat night were delegates to the First Progressive National Convention\r\nat Chicago. They were among my most constant companions for the few\r\nyears next succeeding the evening when the bobcat interrupted the game\r\nof old sledge. I lived and worked with them on the ranch, and with them\r\nand many others like them on the round-up; and I brought out from\r\nMaine, in order to start the Elkhorn ranch lower down the river, my two\r\nbackwoods friends Sewall and Dow. My brands for the lower ranch were the\r\nelkhorn and triangle.\r\n\r\nI do not believe there ever was any life more attractive to a vigorous\r\nyoung fellow than life on a cattle ranch in those days. It was a fine,\r\nhealthy life, too; it taught a man self-reliance, hardihood, and the\r\nvalue of instant decision--in short, the virtues that ought to come\r\nfrom life in the open country. I enjoyed the life to the full. After the\r\nfirst year I built on the Elkhorn ranch a long, low ranch house of\r\nhewn logs, with a veranda, and with, in addition to the other rooms, a\r\nbedroom for myself, and a sitting-room with a big fire-place. I got out\r\na rocking-chair--I am very fond of rocking-chairs--and enough books to\r\nfill two or three shelves, and a rubber bathtub so that I could get\r\na bath. And then I do not see how any one could have lived more\r\ncomfortably. We had buffalo robes and bearskins of our own killing. We\r\nalways kept the house clean--using the word in a rather large sense.\r\nThere were at least two rooms that were always warm, even in the\r\nbitterest weather; and we had plenty to eat. Commonly the mainstay\r\nof every meal was game of our own killing, usually antelope or deer,\r\nsometimes grouse or ducks, and occasionally, in the earlier days,\r\nbuffalo or elk. We also had flour and bacon, sugar, salt, and canned\r\ntomatoes. And later, when some of the men married and brought out their\r\nwives, we had all kinds of good things, such as jams and jellies made\r\nfrom the wild plums and the buffalo berries, and potatoes from the\r\nforlorn little garden patch. Moreover, we had milk. Most ranchmen at\r\nthat time never had milk. I knew more than one ranch with ten thousand\r\nhead of cattle where there was not a cow that could be milked. We made\r\nup our minds that we would be more enterprising. Accordingly, we started\r\nto domesticate some of the cows. Our first effort was not successful,\r\nchiefly because we did not devote the needed time and patience to the\r\nmatter. And we found that to race a cow two miles at full speed on\r\nhorseback, then rope her, throw her, and turn her upside down to milk\r\nher, while exhilarating as a pastime, was not productive of results.\r\nGradually we accumulated tame cows, and, after we had thinned out the\r\nbobcats and coyotes, more chickens.\r\n\r\nThe ranch house stood on the brink of a low bluff overlooking the broad,\r\nshallow bed of the Little Missouri, through which at most seasons there\r\nran only a trickle of water, while in times of freshet it was filled\r\nbrimful with the boiling, foaming, muddy torrent. There was no neighbor\r\nfor ten or fifteen miles on either side of me. The river twisted down\r\nin long curves between narrow bottoms bordered by sheer cliff walls,\r\nfor the Bad Lands, a chaos of peaks, plateaus, and ridges, rose abruptly\r\nfrom the edges of the level, tree-clad, or grassy, alluvial meadows.\r\nIn front of the ranch-house veranda was a row of cottonwood trees with\r\ngray-green leaves which quivered all day long if there was a breath of\r\nair. From these trees came the far-away, melancholy cooing of mourning\r\ndoves, and little owls perched in them and called tremulously at night.\r\nIn the long summer afternoons we would sometimes sit on the piazza, when\r\nthere was no work to be done, for an hour or two at a time, watching the\r\ncattle on the sand-bars, and the sharply channeled and strangely carved\r\namphitheater of cliffs across the bottom opposite; while the vultures\r\nwheeled overhead, their black shadows gliding across the glaring white\r\nof the dry river-bed. Sometimes from the ranch we saw deer, and once\r\nwhen we needed meat I shot one across the river as I stood on the\r\npiazza. In the winter, in the days of iron cold, when everything was\r\nwhite under the snow, the river lay in its bed fixed and immovable as a\r\nbar of bent steel, and then at night wolves and lynxes traveled up and\r\ndown it as if it had been a highway passing in front of the ranch house.\r\nOften in the late fall or early winter, after a hard day's hunting, or\r\nwhen returning from one of the winter line camps, we did not reach the\r\nranch until hours after sunset; and after the weary tramping in the\r\ncold it was keen pleasure to catch the first red gleam of the fire-lit\r\nwindows across the snowy wastes.\r\n\r\nThe Elkhorn ranch house was built mainly by Sewall and Dow, who, like\r\nmost men from the Maine woods, were mighty with the ax. I could chop\r\nfairly well for an amateur, but I could not do one-third the work they\r\ncould. One day when we were cutting down the cottonwood trees, to begin\r\nour building operations, I heard some one ask Dow what the total cut had\r\nbeen, and Dow not realizing that I was within hearing, answered: \"Well,\r\nBill cut down fifty-three, I cut forty-nine, and the boss he beavered\r\ndown seventeen.\" Those who have seen the stump of a tree which has\r\nbeen gnawed down by a beaver will understand the exact force of the\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\nIn those days on a cow ranch the men were apt to be away on the various\r\nround-ups at least half the time. It was interesting and exciting work,\r\nand except for the lack of sleep on the spring and summer round-ups\r\nit was not exhausting work; compared to lumbering or mining or\r\nblacksmithing, to sit in the saddle is an easy form of labor. The ponies\r\nwere of course grass-fed and unshod. Each man had his own string of\r\nnine or ten. One pony would be used for the morning work, one for the\r\nafternoon, and neither would again be used for the next three days. A\r\nseparate pony was kept for night riding.\r\n\r\nThe spring and early summer round-ups were especially for the branding\r\nof calves. There was much hard work and some risk on a round-up, but\r\nalso much fun. The meeting-place was appointed weeks beforehand, and all\r\nthe ranchmen of the territory to be covered by the round-up sent their\r\nrepresentatives. There were no fences in the West that I knew, and their\r\nplace was taken by the cowboy and the branding-iron. The cattle wandered\r\nfree. Each calf was branded with the brand of the cow it was following.\r\nSometimes in winter there was what we called line riding; that is, camps\r\nwere established and the line riders traveled a definite beat across the\r\ndesolate wastes of snow, to and fro from one camp to another, to prevent\r\nthe cattle from drifting. But as a rule nothing was done to keep the\r\ncattle in any one place. In the spring there was a general round-up in\r\neach locality. Each outfit took part in its own round-up, and all the\r\noutfits of a given region combined to send representatives to the two or\r\nthree round-ups that covered the neighborhoods near by into which their\r\ncattle might drift. For example, our Little Missouri round-up generally\r\nworked down the river from a distance of some fifty or sixty miles above\r\nmy ranch toward the Kildeer Mountains, about the same distance below.\r\nIn addition we would usually send representatives to the Yellowstone\r\nround-up, and to the round-up along the upper Little Missouri; and,\r\nmoreover, if we heard that cattle had drifted, perhaps toward the Indian\r\nreservation southeast of us, we would send a wagon and rider after them.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting-point, which might be in the valley of a half-dry stream,\r\nor in some broad bottom of the river itself, or perchance by a couple of\r\nponds under some queerly shaped butte that was a landmark for the region\r\nround about, we would all gather on the appointed day. The chuck-wagons,\r\ncontaining the bedding and food, each drawn by four horses and driven\r\nby the teamster cook, would come jolting and rattling over the\r\nuneven sward. Accompanying each wagon were eight or ten riders, the\r\ncow-punchers, while their horses, a band of a hundred or so, were driven\r\nby the two herders, one of whom was known as the day wrangler and one\r\nas the night wrangler. The men were lean, sinewy fellows, accustomed\r\nto riding half-broken horses at any speed over any country by day or by\r\nnight. They wore flannel shirts, with loose handkerchiefs knotted round\r\ntheir necks, broad hats, high-heeled boots with jingling spurs, and\r\nsometimes leather shaps, although often they merely had their trousers\r\ntucked into the tops of their high boots. There was a good deal of rough\r\nhorse-play, and, as with any other gathering of men or boys of high\r\nanimal spirits, the horse-play sometimes became very rough indeed; and\r\nas the men usually carried revolvers, and as there were occasionally one\r\nor two noted gun-fighters among them, there was now and then a shooting\r\naffray. A man who was a coward or who shirked his work had a bad time,\r\nof course; a man could not afford to let himself be bullied or treated\r\nas a butt; and, on the other hand, if he was \"looking for a fight,\" he\r\nwas certain to find it. But my own experience was that if a man did not\r\ntalk until his associates knew him well and liked him, and if he did\r\nhis work, he never had any difficulty in getting on. In my own round-up\r\ndistrict I speedily grew to be friends with most of the men. When I went\r\namong strangers I always had to spend twenty-four hours in living\r\ndown the fact that I wore spectacles, remaining as long as I could\r\njudiciously deaf to any side remarks about \"four eyes,\" unless it became\r\nevident that my being quiet was misconstrued and that it was better to\r\nbring matters to a head at once.\r\n\r\nIf, for instance, I was sent off to represent the Little Missouri brands\r\non some neighboring round-up, such as the Yellowstone, I usually showed\r\nthat kind of diplomacy which consists in not uttering one word that\r\ncan be avoided. I would probably have a couple of days' solitary ride,\r\nmounted on one horse and driving eight or ten others before me, one of\r\nthem carrying my bedding. Loose horses drive best at a trot, or canter,\r\nand if a man is traveling alone in this fashion it is a good thing to\r\nhave them reach the camp ground sufficiently late to make them desire\r\nto feed and sleep where they are until morning. In consequence I never\r\nspent more than two days on the journey from whatever the point was at\r\nwhich I left the Little Missouri, sleeping the one night for as limited\r\na number of hours as possible.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I reached the meeting-place I would find out the wagon\r\nto which I was assigned. Riding to it, I turned my horses into the\r\nsaddle-band and reported to the wagon boss, or, in his absence, to the\r\ncook--always a privileged character, who was allowed and expected to\r\norder men around. He would usually grumble savagely and profanely about\r\nmy having been put with his wagon, but this was merely conventional on\r\nhis part; and if I sat down and said nothing he would probably soon ask\r\nme if I wanted anything to eat, to which the correct answer was that I\r\nwas not hungry and would wait until meal-time. The bedding rolls of\r\nthe riders would be strewn round the grass, and I would put mine down a\r\nlittle outside the ring, where I would not be in any one's way, with my\r\nsix or eight branding-irons beside it. The men would ride in, laughing\r\nand talking with one another, and perhaps nodding to me. One of their\r\nnumber, usually the wagon foreman, might put some question to me as to\r\nwhat brands I represented, but no other word would be addressed to me,\r\nnor would I be expected to volunteer any conversation. Supper would\r\nconsist of bacon, Dutch oven bread, and possibly beef; once I won\r\nthe good graces of my companions at the outset by appearing with two\r\nantelope which I had shot. After supper I would roll up in my bedding as\r\nsoon as possible, and the others would follow suit at their pleasure.\r\n\r\nAt three in the morning or thereabouts, at a yell from the cook, all\r\nhands would turn hurriedly out. Dressing was a simple affair. Then each\r\nman rolled and corded his bedding--if he did not, the cook would leave\r\nit behind and he would go without any for the rest of the trip--and came\r\nto the fire, where he picked out a tin cup, tin plate, and knife and\r\nfork, helped himself to coffee and to whatever food there was, and ate\r\nit standing or squatting as best suited him. Dawn was probably breaking\r\nby this time, and the trampling of unshod hoofs showed that the night\r\nwrangler was bringing in the pony herd. Two of the men would then run\r\nropes from the wagon at right angles to one another, and into this as\r\na corral the horses would be driven. Each man might rope one of his own\r\nhorses, or more often point it out to the most skillful roper of the\r\noutfit, who would rope it for him--for if the man was an unskillful\r\nroper and roped the wrong horse or roped the horse in the wrong place\r\nthere was a chance of the whole herd stampeding. Each man then saddled\r\nand bridled his horse. This was usually followed by some resolute\r\nbucking on the part of two or three of the horses, especially in\r\nthe early days of each round-up. The bucking was always a source of\r\namusement to all the men whose horses did not buck, and these fortunate\r\nones would gather round giving ironical advice, and especially adjuring\r\nthe rider not to \"go to leather\"--that is, not to steady himself in the\r\nsaddle by catching hold of the saddle-horn.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the men had mounted, the whole outfit started on the long\r\ncircle, the morning circle. Usually the ranch foreman who bossed a given\r\nwagon was put in charge of the men of one group by the round-up foreman;\r\nhe might keep his men together until they had gone some ten or fifteen\r\nmiles from camp, and then drop them in couples at different points. Each\r\ncouple made its way toward the wagon, gathering all the cattle it could\r\nfind. The morning's ride might last six or eight hours, and it was still\r\nlonger before some of the men got in. Singly and in twos and threes they\r\nappeared from every quarter of the horizon, the dust rising from the\r\nhoofs of the steers and bulls, the cows and calves, they had collected.\r\nTwo or three of the men were left to take care of the herd while the\r\nothers changed horses, ate a hasty dinner, and then came out to the\r\nafternoon work. This consisted of each man in succession being sent into\r\nthe herd, usually with a companion, to cut out the cows of his brand or\r\nbrands which were followed by unbranded calves, and also to cut out any\r\nmavericks or unbranded yearlings. We worked each animal gently out to\r\nthe edge of the herd, and then with a sudden dash took it off at a run.\r\nIt was always desperately anxious to break back and rejoin the herd.\r\nThere was much breakneck galloping and twisting and turning before its\r\ndesire was thwarted and it was driven to join the rest of the cut--that\r\nis, the other animals which had been cut out, and which were being held\r\nby one or two other men. Cattle hate being alone, and it was no easy\r\nmatter to hold the first one or two that were cut out; but soon they\r\ngot a little herd of their own, and then they were contented. When\r\nthe cutting out had all been done, the calves were branded, and all\r\nmisadventures of the \"calf wrestlers,\" the men who seized, threw, and\r\nheld each calf when roped by the mounted roper, were hailed with yelling\r\nlaughter. Then the animals which for one reason or another it was\r\ndesired to drive along with the round-up were put into one herd and left\r\nin charge of a couple of night guards, and the rest of us would loaf\r\nback to the wagon for supper and bed.\r\n\r\nBy this time I would have been accepted as one of the rest of the\r\noutfit, and all strangeness would have passed off, the attitude of my\r\nfellow cow-punchers being one of friendly forgiveness even toward my\r\nspectacles. Night guards for the cattle herd were then assigned by the\r\ncaptain of the wagon, or perhaps by the round-up foreman, according to\r\nthe needs of the case, the guards standing for two hours at a time\r\nfrom eight in the evening till four in the morning. The first and last\r\nwatches were preferable, because sleep was not broken as in both of\r\nthe other two. If things went well, the cattle would soon bed down and\r\nnothing further would occur until morning, when there was a repetition\r\nof the work, the wagon moving each day eight or ten miles to some\r\nappointed camping-place.\r\n\r\nEach man would picket his night horse near the wagon, usually choosing\r\nthe quietest animal in his string for that purpose, because to saddle\r\nand mount a \"mean\" horse at night is not pleasant. When utterly\r\ntired, it was hard to have to get up for one's trick at night herd.\r\nNevertheless, on ordinary nights the two hours round the cattle in the\r\nstill darkness were pleasant. The loneliness, under the vast empty sky,\r\nand the silence, in which the breathing of the cattle sounded loud, and\r\nthe alert readiness to meet any emergency which might suddenly arise\r\nout of the formless night, all combined to give one a sense of subdued\r\ninterest. Then, one soon got to know the cattle of marked individuality,\r\nthe ones that led the others into mischief; and one also grew to\r\nrecognize the traits they all possessed in common, and the impulses\r\nwhich, for instance, made a whole herd get up towards midnight, each\r\nbeast turning round and then lying down again. But by the end of the\r\nwatch each rider had studied the cattle until it grew monotonous, and\r\nheartily welcomed his relief guard. A newcomer, of course, had any\r\namount to learn, and sometimes the simplest things were those which\r\nbrought him to grief.\r\n\r\nOne night early in my career I failed satisfactorily to identify the\r\ndirection in which I was to go in order to reach the night herd. It was\r\na pitch-dark night. I managed to get started wrong, and I never found\r\neither the herd or the wagon again until sunrise, when I was greeted\r\nwith withering scorn by the injured cow-puncher, who had been obliged to\r\nstand double guard because I failed to relieve him.\r\n\r\nThere were other misadventures that I met with where the excuse was\r\ngreater. The punchers on night guard usually rode round the cattle in\r\nreverse directions; calling and singing to them if the beasts seemed\r\nrestless, to keep them quiet. On rare occasions something happened that\r\nmade the cattle stampede, and then the duty of the riders was to keep\r\nwith them as long as possible and try gradually to get control of them.\r\n\r\nOne night there was a heavy storm, and all of us who were at the wagons\r\nwere obliged to turn out hastily to help the night herders. After a\r\nwhile there was a terrific peal of thunder, the lightning struck right\r\nby the herd, and away all the beasts went, heads and horns and tails in\r\nthe air. For a minute or two I could make out nothing except the dark\r\nforms of the beasts running on every side of me, and I should have been\r\nvery sorry if my horse had stumbled, for those behind would have trodden\r\nme down. Then the herd split, part going to one side, while the other\r\npart seemingly kept straight ahead, and I galloped as hard as ever\r\nbeside them. I was trying to reach the point--the leading animals--in\r\norder to turn them, when suddenly there was a tremendous splashing in\r\nfront. I could dimly make out that the cattle immediately ahead and to\r\none side of me were disappearing, and the next moment the horse and I\r\nwent off a cut bank into the Little Missouri. I bent away back in the\r\nsaddle, and though the horse almost went down he just recovered himself,\r\nand, plunging and struggling through water and quicksand, we made the\r\nother side. Here I discovered that there was another cowboy with\r\nthe same part of the herd that I was with; but almost immediately we\r\nseparated. I galloped hard through a bottom covered with big cottonwood\r\ntrees, and stopped the part of the herd that I was with, but very soon\r\nthey broke on me again, and repeated this twice. Finally toward morning\r\nthe few I had left came to a halt.\r\n\r\nIt had been raining hard for some time. I got off my horse and leaned\r\nagainst a tree, but before long the infernal cattle started on again,\r\nand I had to ride after them. Dawn came soon after this, and I was\r\nable to make out where I was and head the cattle back, collecting other\r\nlittle bunches as I went. After a while I came on a cowboy on foot\r\ncarrying his saddle on his head. He was my companion of the previous\r\nnight. His horse had gone full speed into a tree and killed itself, the\r\nman, however, not being hurt. I could not help him, as I had all I could\r\ndo to handle the cattle. When I got them to the wagon, most of the other\r\nmen had already come in and the riders were just starting on the long\r\ncircle. One of the men changed my horse for me while I ate a hasty\r\nbreakfast, and then we were off for the day's work.\r\n\r\nAs only about half of the night herd had been brought back, the circle\r\nriding was particularly heavy, and it was ten hours before we were back\r\nat the wagon. We then changed horses again and worked the whole herd\r\nuntil after sunset, finishing just as it grew too dark to do anything\r\nmore. By this time I had been nearly forty hours in the saddle, changing\r\nhorses five times, and my clothes had thoroughly dried on me, and I fell\r\nasleep as soon as I touched the bedding. Fortunately some men who had\r\ngotten in late in the morning had had their sleep during the daytime, so\r\nthat the rest of us escaped night guard and were not called until four\r\nnext morning. Nobody ever gets enough sleep on a round-up.\r\n\r\nThe above was the longest number of consecutive hours I ever had to be\r\nin the saddle. But, as I have said, I changed horses five times, and it\r\nis a great lightening of labor for a rider to have a fresh horse. Once\r\nwhen with Sylvane Ferris I spent about sixteen hours on one horse,\r\nriding seventy or eighty miles. The round-up had reached a place called\r\nthe ox-bow of the Little Missouri, and we had to ride there, do some\r\nwork around the cattle, and ride back.\r\n\r\nAnother time I was twenty-four hours on horseback in company with\r\nMerrifield without changing horses. On this occasion we did not travel\r\nfast. We had been coming back with the wagon from a hunting trip in\r\nthe Big Horn Mountains. The team was fagged out, and we were tired of\r\nwalking at a snail's pace beside it. When we reached country that the\r\ndriver thoroughly knew, we thought it safe to leave him, and we loped in\r\none night across a distance which it took the wagon the three following\r\ndays to cover. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the ride was\r\ndelightful. All day long we had plodded at a walk, weary and hot. At\r\nsupper time we had rested two or three hours, and the tough little\r\nriding horses seemed as fresh as ever. It was in September. As we rode\r\nout of the circle of the firelight, the air was cool in our faces.\r\nUnder the bright moonlight, and then under the starlight, we loped\r\nand cantered mile after mile over the high prairie. We passed bands of\r\nantelope and herds of long-horn Texas cattle, and at last, just as the\r\nfirst red beams of the sun flamed over the bluffs in front of us, we\r\nrode down into the valley of the Little Missouri, where our ranch house\r\nstood.\r\n\r\nI never became a good roper, nor more than an average rider, according\r\nto ranch standards. Of course a man on a ranch has to ride a good many\r\nbad horses, and is bound to encounter a certain number of accidents,\r\nand of these I had my share, at one time cracking a rib, and on another\r\noccasion the point of my shoulder. We were hundreds of miles from a\r\ndoctor, and each time, as I was on the round-up, I had to get through my\r\nwork for the next few weeks as best I could, until the injury healed\r\nof itself. When I had the opportunity I broke my own horses, doing it\r\ngently and gradually and spending much time over it, and choosing the\r\nhorses that seemed gentle to begin with. With these horses I never had\r\nany difficulty. But frequently there was neither time nor opportunity\r\nto handle our mounts so elaborately. We might get a band of horses, each\r\nhaving been bridled and saddled two or three times, but none of them\r\nhaving been broken beyond the extent implied in this bridling and\r\nsaddling. Then each of us in succession would choose a horse (for his\r\nstring), I as owner of the ranch being given the first choice on each\r\nround, so to speak. The first time I was ever on a round-up Sylvane\r\nFerris, Merrifield, Meyer, and I each chose his string in this fashion.\r\nThree or four of the animals I got were not easy to ride. The effort\r\nboth to ride them and to look as if I enjoyed doing so, on some cool\r\nmorning when my grinning cowboy friends had gathered round \"to see\r\nwhether the high-headed bay could buck the boss off,\" doubtless was of\r\nbenefit to me, but lacked much of being enjoyable. The time I smashed\r\nmy rib I was bucked off on a stone. The time I hurt the point of my\r\nshoulder I was riding a big, sulky horse named Ben Butler, which went\r\nover backwards with me. When we got up it still refused to go anywhere;\r\nso, while I sat it, Sylvane Ferris and George Meyer got their ropes on\r\nits neck and dragged it a few hundred yards, choking but stubborn, all\r\nfour feet firmly planted and plowing the ground. When they released\r\nthe ropes it lay down and wouldn't get up. The round-up had started; so\r\nSylvane gave me his horse, Baldy, which sometimes bucked but never\r\nwent over backwards, and he got on the now rearisen Ben Butler. To my\r\ndiscomfiture Ben started quietly beside us, while Sylvane remarked,\r\n\"Why, there's nothing the matter with this horse; he's a plumb gentle\r\nhorse.\" Then Ben fell slightly behind and I heard Sylvane again, \"That's\r\nall right! Come along! Here, you! Go on, you! Hi, hi, fellows, help me\r\nout! he's lying on me!\" Sure enough, he was; and when we dragged Sylvane\r\nfrom under him the first thing the rescued Sylvane did was to execute\r\na war-dance, spurs and all, on the iniquitous Ben. We could do nothing\r\nwith him that day; subsequently we got him so that we could ride him;\r\nbut he never became a nice saddle-horse.\r\n\r\nAs with all other forms of work, so on the round-up, a man of ordinary\r\npower, who nevertheless does not shirk things merely because they are\r\ndisagreeable or irksome, soon earns his place. There were crack riders\r\nand ropers who, just because they felt such overweening pride in their\r\nown prowess, were not really very valuable men. Continually on the\r\ncircles a cow or a calf would get into some thick patch of bulberry bush\r\nand refuse to come out; or when it was getting late we would pass some\r\nbad lands that would probably not contain cattle, but might; or a steer\r\nwould turn fighting mad, or a calf grow tired and want to lie down.\r\nIf in such a case the man steadily persists in doing the unattractive\r\nthing, and after two hours of exasperation and harassment does finally\r\nget the cow out, and keep her out, of the bulberry bushes, and drives\r\nher to the wagon, or finds some animals that have been passed by in the\r\nfourth or fifth patch of bad lands he hunts through, or gets the calf\r\nup on his saddle and takes it in anyhow, the foreman soon grows to treat\r\nhim as having his uses and as being an asset of worth in the round-up,\r\neven though neither a fancy roper nor a fancy rider.\r\n\r\nWhen at the Progressive Convention last August, I met George Meyer for\r\nthe first time in many years, and he recalled to me an incident on one\r\nround-up where we happened to be thrown together while driving some cows\r\nand calves to camp. When the camp was only just across the river, two of\r\nthe calves positively refused to go any further. He took one of them\r\nin his arms, and after some hazardous maneuvering managed to get on\r\nhis horse, in spite of the objections of the latter, and rode into the\r\nriver. My calf was too big for such treatment, so in despair I roped\r\nit, intending to drag it over. However, as soon as I roped it, the calf\r\nstarted bouncing and bleating, and, owing to some lack of dexterity on\r\nmy part, suddenly swung round the rear of the horse, bringing the rope\r\nunder his tail. Down went the tail tight, and the horse \"went into\r\nfigures,\" as the cow-puncher phrase of that day was. There was a cut\r\nbank about four feet high on the hither side of the river, and over this\r\nthe horse bucked. We went into the water with a splash. With a \"pluck\"\r\nthe calf followed, described a parabola in the air, and landed beside\r\nus. Fortunately, this took the rope out from under the horse's tail,\r\nbut left him thoroughly frightened. He could not do much bucking in the\r\nstream, for there were one or two places where we had to swim, and the\r\nshallows were either sandy or muddy; but across we went, at speed, and\r\nthe calf made a wake like Pharaoh's army in the Red Sea.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions we had to fight fire. In the geography books of my\r\nyouth prairie fires were always portrayed as taking place in long grass,\r\nand all living things ran before them. On the Northern cattle plains the\r\ngrass was never long enough to be a source of danger to man or beast.\r\nThe fires were nothing like the forest fires in the Northern woods. But\r\nthey destroyed large quantities of feed, and we had to stop them where\r\npossible. The process we usually followed was to kill a steer, split it\r\nin two lengthwise, and then have two riders drag each half-steer, the\r\nrope of one running from his saddle-horn to the front leg, and that of\r\nthe other to the hind leg. One of the men would spur his horse over or\r\nthrough the line of fire, and the two would then ride forward, dragging\r\nthe steer bloody side downward along the line of flame, men following\r\non foot with slickers or wet horse-blankets, to beat out any flickering\r\nblaze that was still left. It was exciting work, for the fire and the\r\ntwitching and plucking of the ox carcass over the uneven ground maddened\r\nthe fierce little horses so that it was necessary to do some riding\r\nin order to keep them to their work. After a while it also became very\r\nexhausting, the thirst and fatigue being great, as, with parched lips\r\nand blackened from head to foot, we toiled at our task.\r\n\r\nIn those years the Stockman's Association of Montana was a powerful\r\nbody. I was the delegate to it from the Little Missouri. The meetings\r\nthat I attended were held in Miles City, at that time a typical cow\r\ntown. Stockmen of all kinds attended, including the biggest men in the\r\nstock business, men like old Conrad Kohrs, who was and is the finest\r\ntype of pioneer in all the Rocky Mountain country; and Granville\r\nStewart, who was afterwards appointed Minister by Cleveland, I think\r\nto the Argentine; and \"Hashknife\" Simpson, a Texan who had brought his\r\ncattle, the Hashknife brand, up the trail into our country. He and\r\nI grew to be great friends. I can see him now the first time we met,\r\ngrinning at me as, none too comfortable, I sat a half-broken horse at\r\nthe edge of a cattle herd we were working. His son Sloan Simpson went to\r\nHarvard, was one of the first-class men in my regiment, and afterwards\r\nheld my commission as Postmaster at Dallas.\r\n\r\nAt the stockmen's meeting in Miles City, in addition to the big\r\nstockmen, there were always hundreds of cowboys galloping up and down\r\nthe wide dusty streets at every hour of the day and night. It was a\r\npicturesque sight during the three days the meetings lasted. There was\r\nalways at least one big dance at the hotel. There were few dress suits,\r\nbut there was perfect decorum at the dance, and in the square dances\r\nmost of the men knew the figures far better than I did. With such a\r\ncrowd in town, sleeping accommodations of any sort were at a premium,\r\nand in the hotel there were two men in every bed. On one occasion I had\r\na roommate whom I never saw, because he always went to bed much later\r\nthan I did and I always got up much earlier than he did. On the last\r\nday, however, he rose at the same time and I saw that he was a man I\r\nknew named Carter, and nicknamed \"Modesty\" Carter. He was a stalwart,\r\ngood-looking fellow, and I was sorry when later I heard that he had been\r\nkilled in a shooting row.\r\n\r\nWhen I went West, the last great Indian wars had just come to an end,\r\nbut there were still sporadic outbreaks here and there, and occasionally\r\nbands of marauding young braves were a menace to outlying and lonely\r\nsettlements. Many of the white men were themselves lawless and brutal,\r\nand prone to commit outrages on the Indians. Unfortunately, each race\r\ntended to hold all the members of the other race responsible for the\r\nmisdeeds of a few, so that the crime of the miscreant, red or white,\r\nwho committed the original outrage too often invited retaliation upon\r\nentirely innocent people, and this action would in its turn arouse\r\nbitter feeling which found vent in still more indiscriminate\r\nretaliation. The first year I was on the Little Missouri some Sioux\r\nbucks ran off all the horses of a buffalo-hunter's outfit. One of the\r\nbuffalo-hunters tried to get even by stealing the horses of a Cheyenne\r\nhunting party, and when pursued made for a cow camp, with, as a result,\r\na long-range skirmish between the cowboys and the Cheyennes. One of the\r\nlatter was wounded; but this particular wounded man seemed to have\r\nmore sense than the other participants in the chain of wrong-doing, and\r\ndiscriminated among the whites. He came into our camp and had his wound\r\ndressed.\r\n\r\nA year later I was at a desolate little mud road ranch on the Deadwood\r\ntrail. It was kept by a very capable and very forceful woman, with sound\r\nideas of justice and abundantly well able to hold her own. Her husband\r\nwas a worthless devil, who finally got drunk on some whisky he obtained\r\nfrom an outfit of Missouri bull-whackers--that is, freighters, driving\r\nox wagons. Under the stimulus of the whisky he picked a quarrel with his\r\nwife and attempted to beat her. She knocked him down with a stove-lid\r\nlifter, and the admiring bull-whackers bore him off, leaving the lady\r\nin full possession of the ranch. When I visited her she had a man named\r\nCrow Joe working for her, a slab-sided, shifty-eyed person who later,\r\nas I heard my foreman explain, \"skipped the country with a bunch of\r\nhorses.\" The mistress of the ranch made first-class buckskin shirts of\r\ngreat durability. The one she made for me, and which I used for years,\r\nwas used by one of my sons in Arizona a couple of winters ago. I had\r\nridden down into the country after some lost horses, and visited the\r\nranch to get her to make me the buckskin shirt in question. There\r\nwere, at the moment, three Indians there, Sioux, well behaved and\r\nself-respecting, and she explained to me that they had been resting\r\nthere waiting for dinner, and that a white man had come along and tried\r\nto run off their horses. The Indians were on the lookout, however, and,\r\nrunning out, they caught the man; but, after retaking their horses and\r\ndepriving him of his gun, they let him go. \"I don't see why they let him\r\ngo,\" exclaimed my hostess. \"I don't believe in stealing Indians' horses\r\nany more than white folks'; so I told 'em they could go along and hang\r\nhim--I'd never cheep. Anyhow, I won't charge them anything for their\r\ndinner,\" concluded my hostess. She was in advance of the usual morality\r\nof the time and place, which drew a sharp line between stealing\r\ncitizens' horses and stealing horses from the Government or the Indians.\r\n\r\nA fairly decent citizen, Jap Hunt, who long ago met a violent death,\r\nexemplified this attitude towards Indians in some remarks I once heard\r\nhim make. He had started a horse ranch, and had quite honestly purchased\r\na number of broken-down horses of different brands, with the view of\r\ndoctoring them and selling them again. About this time there had been\r\nmuch horse-stealing and cattle-killing in our Territory and in Montana,\r\nand under the direction of some of the big cattle-growers a committee\r\nof vigilantes had been organized to take action against the rustlers,\r\nas the horse thieves and cattle thieves were called. The vigilantes, or\r\nstranglers, as they were locally known, did their work thoroughly; but,\r\nas always happens with bodies of the kind, toward the end they grew\r\nreckless in their actions, paid off private grudges, and hung men on\r\nslight provocation. Riding into Jap Hunt's ranch, they nearly hung him\r\nbecause he had so many horses of different brands. He was finally let\r\noff. He was much upset by the incident, and explained again and again,\r\n\"The idea of saying that I was a horse thief! Why, I never stole a horse\r\nin my life--leastways from a white man. I don't count Indians nor the\r\nGovernment, of course.\" Jap had been reared among men still in the stage\r\nof tribal morality, and while they recognized their obligations to one\r\nanother, both the Government and the Indians seemed alien bodies, in\r\nregard to which the laws of morality did not apply.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, parties of savage young bucks would treat lonely\r\nsettlers just as badly, and in addition sometimes murder them. Such a\r\nparty was generally composed of young fellows burning to distinguish\r\nthemselves. Some one of their number would have obtained a pass from\r\nthe Indian Agent allowing him to travel off the reservation, which pass\r\nwould be flourished whenever their action was questioned by bodies of\r\nwhites of equal strength. I once had a trifling encounter with such a\r\nband. I was making my way along the edge of the bad lands, northward\r\nfrom my lower ranch, and was just crossing a plateau when five Indians\r\nrode up over the further rim. The instant they saw me they whipped\r\nout their guns and raced full speed at me, yelling and flogging their\r\nhorses. I was on a favorite horse, Manitou, who was a wise old fellow,\r\nwith nerves not to be shaken by anything. I at once leaped off him and\r\nstood with my rifle ready.\r\n\r\nIt was possible that the Indians were merely making a bluff and intended\r\nno mischief. But I did not like their actions, and I thought it likely\r\nthat if I allowed them to get hold of me they would at least take my\r\nhorse and rifle, and possibly kill me. So I waited until they were a\r\nhundred yards off and then drew a bead on the first. Indians--and, for\r\nthe matter of that, white men--do not like to ride in on a man who is\r\ncool and means shooting, and in a twinkling every man was lying over the\r\nside of his horse, and all five had turned and were galloping backwards,\r\nhaving altered their course as quickly as so many teal ducks.\r\n\r\nAfter this one of them made the peace sign, with his blanket first, and\r\nthen, as he rode toward me, with his open hand. I halted him at a fair\r\ndistance and asked him what he wanted. He exclaimed, \"How! Me good\r\nInjun, me good Injun,\" and tried to show me the dirty piece of paper on\r\nwhich his agency pass was written. I told him with sincerity that I was\r\nglad that he was a good Indian, but that he must not come any closer. He\r\nthen asked for sugar and tobacco. I told him I had none. Another Indian\r\nbegan slowly drifting toward me in spite of my calling out to keep back,\r\nso I once more aimed with my rifle, whereupon both Indians slipped to\r\nthe other side of their horses and galloped off, with oaths that did\r\ncredit to at least one side of their acquaintance with English. I now\r\nmounted and pushed over the plateau on to the open prairie. In those\r\ndays an Indian, although not as good a shot as a white man, was\r\ninfinitely better at crawling under and taking advantage of cover; and\r\nthe worst thing a white man could do was to get into cover, whereas out\r\nin the open if he kept his head he had a good chance of standing off\r\neven half a dozen assailants. The Indians accompanied me for a couple of\r\nmiles. Then I reached the open prairie, and resumed my northward ride,\r\nnot being further molested.\r\n\r\nIn the old days in the ranch country we depended upon game for fresh\r\nmeat. Nobody liked to kill a beef, and although now and then a maverick\r\nyearling might be killed on the round-up, most of us looked askance at\r\nthe deed, because if the practice of beef-killing was ever allowed to\r\nstart, the rustlers--the horse thieves and cattle thieves--would be sure\r\nto seize on it as an excuse for general slaughter. Getting meat for the\r\nranch usually devolved upon me. I almost always carried a rifle when I\r\nrode, either in a scabbard under my thigh, or across the pommel. Often\r\nI would pick up a deer or antelope while about my regular work, when\r\nvisiting a line camp or riding after the cattle. At other times I would\r\nmake a day's trip after them. In the fall we sometimes took a wagon\r\nand made a week's hunt, returning with eight or ten deer carcasses, and\r\nperhaps an elk or a mountain sheep as well. I never became more than a\r\nfair hunter, and at times I had most exasperating experiences, either\r\nfailing to see game which I ought to have seen, or committing some\r\nblunder in the stalk, or failing to kill when I fired. Looking back,\r\nI am inclined to say that if I had any good quality as a hunter it was\r\nthat of perseverance. \"It is dogged that does it\" in hunting as in many\r\nother things. Unless in wholly exceptional cases, when we were very\r\nhungry, I never killed anything but bucks.\r\n\r\nOccasionally I made long trips away from the ranch and among the Rocky\r\nMountains with my ranch foreman Merrifield; or in later years with\r\nTazewell Woody, John Willis, or John Goff. We hunted bears, both the\r\nblack and the grizzly, cougars and wolves, and moose, wapiti, and white\r\ngoat. On one of these trips I killed a bison bull, and I also killed a\r\nbison bull on the Little Missouri some fifty miles south of my ranch on\r\na trip which Joe Ferris and I took together. It was rather a rough trip.\r\nEach of us carried only his slicker behind him on the saddle, with some\r\nflour and bacon done up in it. We met with all kinds of misadventures.\r\nFinally one night, when we were sleeping by a slimy little prairie pool\r\nwhere there was not a stick of wood, we had to tie the horses to the\r\nhorns of our saddles; and then we went to sleep with our heads on the\r\nsaddles. In the middle of the night something stampeded the horses, and\r\naway they went, with the saddles after them. As we jumped to our feet\r\nJoe eyed me with an evident suspicion that I was the Jonah of the party,\r\nand said: \"O Lord! I've never done anything to deserve this. Did you\r\never do anything to deserve this?\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to my private duties, I sometimes served as deputy sheriff\r\nfor the northern end of our county. The sheriff and I crisscrossed in\r\nour public and private relations. He often worked for me as a hired hand\r\nat the same time that I was his deputy. His name, or at least the\r\nname he went by, was Bill Jones, and as there were in the neighborhood\r\nseveral Bill Joneses--Three Seven Bill Jones, Texas Bill Jones, and\r\nthe like--the sheriff was known as Hell Roaring Bill Jones. He was a\r\nthorough frontiersman, excellent in all kinds of emergencies, and a\r\nvery game man. I became much attached to him. He was a thoroughly good\r\ncitizen when sober, but he was a little wild when drunk. Unfortunately,\r\ntoward the end of his life he got to drinking very heavily. When, in\r\n1905, John Burroughs and I visited the Yellowstone Park, poor Bill\r\nJones, very much down in the world, was driving a team in Gardiner\r\noutside the park. I had looked forward to seeing him, and he was equally\r\nanxious to see me. He kept telling his cronies of our intimacy and of\r\nwhat we were going to do together, and then got drinking; and the result\r\nwas that by the time I reached Gardiner he had to be carried out and\r\nleft in the sage-brush. When I came out of the park, I sent on in\r\nadvance to tell them to be sure to keep him sober, and they did so. But\r\nit was a rather sad interview. The old fellow had gone to pieces, and\r\nsoon after I left he got lost in a blizzard and was dead when they found\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBill Jones was a gun-fighter and also a good man with his fists. On one\r\noccasion there was an election in town. There had been many threats that\r\nthe party of disorder would import section hands from the neighboring\r\nrailway stations to down our side. I did not reach Medora, the forlorn\r\nlittle cattle town which was our county seat, until the election was\r\nwell under way. I then asked one of my friends if there had been any\r\ndisorder. Bill Jones was standing by. \"Disorder hell!\" said my friend.\r\n\"Bill Jones just stood there with one hand on his gun and the other\r\npointing over toward the new jail whenever any man who didn't have a\r\nright to vote came near the polls. There was only one of them tried to\r\nvote, and Bill knocked him down. Lord!\" added my friend, meditatively,\r\n\"the way that man fell!\" \"Well,\" struck in Bill Jones, \"if he hadn't\r\nfell I'd have walked round behind him to see what was propping him up!\"\r\n\r\nIn the days when I lived on the ranch I usually spent most of the\r\nwinter in the East, and when I returned in the early spring I was always\r\ninterested in finding out what had happened since my departure. On one\r\noccasion I was met by Bill Jones and Sylvane Ferris, and in the course\r\nof our conversation they mentioned \"the lunatic.\" This led to a question\r\non my part, and Sylvane Ferris began the story: \"Well, you see, he was\r\non a train and he shot the newsboy. At first they weren't going to do\r\nanything to him, for they thought he just had it in for the newsboy. But\r\nthen somebody said, 'Why, he's plumb crazy, and he's liable to shoot any\r\nof us!' and then they threw him off the train. It was here at Medora,\r\nand they asked if anybody would take care of him, and Bill Jones said he\r\nwould, because he was the sheriff and the jail had two rooms, and he was\r\nliving in one and would put the lunatic in the other.\" Here Bill Jones\r\ninterrupted: \"Yes, and more fool me! I wouldn't take charge of another\r\nlunatic if the whole county asked me. Why\" (with the air of a man\r\nannouncing an astounding discovery), \"that lunatic didn't have his right\r\nsenses! He wouldn't eat, till me and Snyder got him down on the shavings\r\nand made him eat.\" Snyder was a huge, happy-go-lucky, kind-hearted\r\nPennsylvania Dutchman, and was Bill Jones's chief deputy. Bill\r\ncontinued: \"You know, Snyder's soft-hearted, he is. Well, he'd think\r\nthat lunatic looked peaked, and he'd take him out for an airing. Then\r\nthe boys would get joshing him as to how much start he could give him\r\nover the prairie and catch him again.\" Apparently the amount of the\r\nstart given the lunatic depended upon the amount of the bet to which the\r\njoshing led up. I asked Bill what he would have done if Snyder hadn't\r\ncaught the lunatic. This was evidently a new idea, and he responded that\r\nSnyder always did catch him. \"Well, but suppose he hadn't caught him?\"\r\n\"Well,\" said Bill Jones, \"if Snyder hadn't caught the lunatic, I'd have\r\nwhaled hell out of Snyder!\"\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances Snyder ran his best and always did catch the\r\npatient. It must not be gathered from this that the lunatic was badly\r\ntreated. He was well treated. He become greatly attached to both Bill\r\nJones and Snyder, and he objected strongly when, after the frontier\r\ntheory of treatment of the insane had received a full trial, he was\r\nfinally sent off to the territorial capital. It was merely that all the\r\nrelations of life in that place and day were so managed as to give ample\r\nopportunity for the expression of individuality, whether in sheriff or\r\nranchman. The local practical joker once attempted to have some fun at\r\nthe expense of the lunatic, and Bill Jones described the result. \"You\r\nknow Bixby, don't you? Well,\" with deep disapproval, \"Bixby thinks he\r\nis funny, he does. He'd come and he'd wake that lunatic up at night, and\r\nI'd have to get up and soothe him. I fixed Bixby all right, though. I\r\nfastened a rope on the latch, and next time Bixby came I let the lunatic\r\nout on him. He 'most bit Bixby's nose off. I learned Bixby!\"\r\n\r\nBill Jones had been unconventional in other relations besides that of\r\nsheriff. He once casually mentioned to me that he had served on the\r\npolice force of Bismarck, but he had left because he \"beat the Mayor\r\nover the head with his gun one day.\" He added: \"The Mayor, he didn't\r\nmind it, but the Superintendent of Police said he guessed I'd better\r\nresign.\" His feeling, obviously, was that the Superintendent of Police\r\nwas a martinet, unfit to take large views of life.\r\n\r\nIt was while with Bill Jones that I first made acquaintance with Seth\r\nBullock. Seth was at that time sheriff in the Black Hills district, and\r\na man he had wanted--a horse thief--I finally got, I being at the time\r\ndeputy sheriff two or three hundred miles to the north. The man went by\r\na nickname which I will call \"Crazy Steve\"; a year or two afterwards\r\nI received a letter asking about him from his uncle, a thoroughly\r\nrespectable man in a Western State; and later this uncle and I met at\r\nWashington when I was President and he a United States Senator. It\r\nwas some time after \"Steve's\" capture that I went down to Deadwood on\r\nbusiness, Sylvane Ferris and I on horseback, while Bill Jones drove the\r\nwagon. At a little town, Spearfish, I think, after crossing the last\r\neighty or ninety miles of gumbo prairies, we met Seth Bullock. We had\r\nhad rather a rough trip, and had lain out for a fortnight, so I suppose\r\nwe looked somewhat unkempt. Seth received us with rather distant\r\ncourtesy at first, but unbent when he found out who we were, remarking,\r\n\"You see, by your looks I thought you were some kind of a tin-horn\r\ngambling outfit, and that I might have to keep an eye on you!\" He then\r\ninquired after the capture of \"Steve\"--with a little of the air of\r\none sportsman when another has shot a quail that either might have\r\nclaimed--\"My bird, I believe?\" Later Seth Bullock became, and has ever\r\nsince remained, one of my stanchest and most valued friends. He served\r\nas Marshal for South Dakota under me as President. When, after the close\r\nof my term, I went to Africa, on getting back to Europe I cabled Seth\r\nBullock to bring over Mrs. Bullock and meet me in London, which he did;\r\nby that time I felt that I just had to meet my own people, who spoke my\r\nneighborhood dialect.\r\n\r\nWhen serving as deputy sheriff I was impressed with the advantage the\r\nofficer of the law has over ordinary wrong-doers, provided he thoroughly\r\nknows his own mind. There are exceptional outlaws, men with a price on\r\ntheir heads and of remarkable prowess, who are utterly indifferent to\r\ntaking life, and whose warfare against society is as open as that of a\r\nsavage on the war-path. The law officer has no advantage whatever over\r\nthese men save what his own prowess may--or may not--give him. Such a\r\nman was Billy the Kid, the notorious man-killer and desperado of New\r\nMexico, who was himself finally slain by a friend of mine, Pat Garrett,\r\nwhom, when I was President, I made collector of customs at El Paso.\r\nBut the ordinary criminal, even when murderously inclined, feels just a\r\nmoment's hesitation as to whether he cares to kill an officer of the\r\nlaw engaged in his duty. I took in more than one man who was probably a\r\nbetter man than I was with both rifle and revolver; but in each case I\r\nknew just what I wanted to do, and, like David Harum, I \"did it first,\"\r\nwhereas the fraction of a second that the other man hesitated put him in\r\na position where it was useless for him to resist.\r\n\r\nI owe more than I can ever express to the West, which of course means to\r\nthe men and women I met in the West. There were a few people of bad type\r\nin my neighborhood--that would be true of every group of men, even in a\r\ntheological seminary--but I could not speak with too great affection and\r\nrespect of the great majority of my friends, the hard-working men and\r\nwomen who dwelt for a space of perhaps a hundred and fifty miles along\r\nthe Little Missouri. I was always as welcome at their houses as they\r\nwere at mine. Everybody worked, everybody was willing to help everybody\r\nelse, and yet nobody asked any favors. The same thing was true of the\r\npeople whom I got to know fifty miles east and fifty miles west of my\r\nown range, and of the men I met on the round-ups. They soon accepted me\r\nas a friend and fellow-worker who stood on an equal footing with them,\r\nand I believe the most of them have kept their feeling for me ever\r\nsince. No guests were ever more welcome at the White House than these\r\nold friends of the cattle ranches and the cow camps--the men with whom\r\nI had ridden the long circle and eaten at the tail-board of a\r\nchuck-wagon--whenever they turned up at Washington during my Presidency.\r\nI remember one of them who appeared at Washington one day just before\r\nlunch, a huge, powerful man who, when I knew him, had been distinctly a\r\nfighting character. It happened that on that day another old friend,\r\nthe British Ambassador, Mr. Bryce, was among those coming to lunch. Just\r\nbefore we went in I turned to my cow-puncher friend and said to him with\r\ngreat solemnity, \"Remember, Jim, that if you shot at the feet of the\r\nBritish Ambassador to make him dance, it would be likely to cause\r\ninternational complications\"; to which Jim responded with unaffected\r\nhorror, \"Why, Colonel, I shouldn't think of it, I shouldn't think of\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\nNot only did the men and women whom I met in the cow country quite\r\nunconsciously help me, by the insight which working and living with them\r\nenabled me to get into the mind and soul of the average American of the\r\nright type, but they helped me in another way. I made up my mind that\r\nthe men were of just the kind whom it would be well to have with me if\r\never it became necessary to go to war. When the Spanish War came, I gave\r\nthis thought practical realization.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Wister and Remington, with pen and pencil, have made these\r\nmen live as long as our literature lives. I have sometimes been asked\r\nif Wister's \"Virginian\" is not overdrawn; why, one of the men I have\r\nmentioned in this chapter was in all essentials the Virginian in real\r\nlife, not only in his force but in his charm. Half of the men I worked\r\nwith or played with and half of the men who soldiered with me afterwards\r\nin my regiment might have walked out of Wister's stories or Remington's\r\npictures.\r\n\r\nThere were bad characters in the Western country at that time, of\r\ncourse, and under the conditions of life they were probably more\r\ndangerous than they would have been elsewhere. I hardly ever had any\r\ndifficulty, however. I never went into a saloon, and in the little\r\nhotels I kept out of the bar-room unless, as sometimes happened, the\r\nbar-room was the only room on the lower floor except the dining-room. I\r\nalways endeavored to keep out of a quarrel until self-respect forbade\r\nmy making any further effort to avoid it, and I very rarely had even the\r\nsemblance of trouble.\r\n\r\nOf course amusing incidents occurred now and then. Usually these took\r\nplace when I was hunting lost horses, for in hunting lost horses I was\r\nordinarily alone, and occasionally had to travel a hundred or a hundred\r\nand fifty miles away from my own country. On one such occasion I\r\nreached a little cow town long after dark, stabled my horse in an empty\r\noutbuilding, and when I reached the hotel was informed in response to my\r\nrequest for a bed that I could have the last one left, as there was only\r\none other man in it. The room to which I was shown contained two double\r\nbeds; one contained two men fast asleep, and the other only one man,\r\nalso asleep. This man proved to be a friend, one of the Bill Joneses\r\nwhom I have previously mentioned. I undressed according to the fashion\r\nof the day and place, that is, I put my trousers, boots, shaps, and\r\ngun down beside the bed, and turned in. A couple of hours later I was\r\nawakened by the door being thrown open and a lantern flashed in my face,\r\nthe light gleaming on the muzzle of a cocked .45. Another man said to\r\nthe lantern-bearer, \"It ain't him\"; the next moment my bedfellow was\r\ncovered with two guns, and addressed, \"Now, Bill, don't make a fuss,\r\nbut come along quiet.\" \"I'm not thinking of making a fuss,\" said Bill.\r\n\"That's right,\" was the answer; \"we're your friends; we don't want to\r\nhurt you; we just want you to come along, you know why.\" And Bill pulled\r\non his trousers and boots and walked out with them. Up to this\r\ntime there had not been a sound from the other bed. Now a match was\r\nscratched, a candle lit, and one of the men in the other bed looked\r\nround the room. At this point I committed the breach of etiquette of\r\nasking questions. \"I wonder why they took Bill,\" I said. There was no\r\nanswer, and I repeated, \"I wonder why they took Bill.\" \"Well,\" said the\r\nman with the candle, dryly, \"I reckon they wanted him,\" and with that\r\nhe blew out the candle and conversation ceased. Later I discovered that\r\nBill in a fit of playfulness had held up the Northern Pacific train at\r\na near-by station by shooting at the feet of the conductor to make him\r\ndance. This was purely a joke on Bill's part, but the Northern Pacific\r\npeople possessed a less robust sense of humor, and on their complaint\r\nthe United States Marshal was sent after Bill, on the ground that by\r\ndelaying the train he had interfered with the mails.\r\n\r\nThe only time I ever had serious trouble was at an even more primitive\r\nlittle hotel than the one in question. It was also on an occasion when\r\nI was out after lost horses. Below the hotel had merely a bar-room, a\r\ndining-room, and a lean-to kitchen; above was a loft with fifteen or\r\ntwenty beds in it. It was late in the evening when I reached the place.\r\nI heard one or two shots in the bar-room as I came up, and I disliked\r\ngoing in. But there was nowhere else to go, and it was a cold night.\r\nInside the room were several men, who, including the bartender, were\r\nwearing the kind of smile worn by men who are making believe to like\r\nwhat they don't like. A shabby individual in a broad hat with a cocked\r\ngun in each hand was walking up and down the floor talking with strident\r\nprofanity. He had evidently been shooting at the clock, which had two or\r\nthree holes in its face.\r\n\r\nHe was not a \"bad man\" of the really dangerous type, the true man-killer\r\ntype, but he was an objectionable creature, a would-be bad man, a bully\r\nwho for the moment was having things all his own way. As soon as he saw\r\nme he hailed me as \"Four eyes,\" in reference to my spectacles, and said,\r\n\"Four eyes is going to treat.\" I joined in the laugh and got behind the\r\nstove and sat down, thinking to escape notice. He followed me, however,\r\nand though I tried to pass it off as a jest this merely made him more\r\noffensive, and he stood leaning over me, a gun in each hand, using very\r\nfoul language. He was foolish to stand so near, and, moreover, his heels\r\nwere close together, so that his position was unstable. Accordingly, in\r\nresponse to his reiterated command that I should set up the drinks, I\r\nsaid, \"Well, if I've got to, I've got to,\" and rose, looking past him.\r\n\r\nAs I rose, I struck quick and hard with my right just to one side of the\r\npoint of his jaw, hitting with my left as I straightened out, and then\r\nagain with my right. He fired the guns, but I do not know whether this\r\nwas merely a convulsive action of his hands or whether he was trying to\r\nshoot at me. When he went down he struck the corner of the bar with his\r\nhead. It was not a case in which one could afford to take chances, and\r\nif he had moved I was about to drop on his ribs with my knees; but he\r\nwas senseless. I took away his guns, and the other people in the room,\r\nwho were now loud in their denunciation of him, hustled him out and put\r\nhim in a shed. I got dinner as soon as possible, sitting in a corner\r\nof the dining-room away from the windows, and then went upstairs to bed\r\nwhere it was dark so that there would be no chance of any one shooting\r\nat me from the outside. However, nothing happened. When my assailant\r\ncame to, he went down to the station and left on a freight.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, most of the men of my regiment were just such men as\r\nthose I knew in the ranch country; indeed, some of my ranch friends were\r\nin the regiment--Fred Herrig, the forest ranger, for instance, in whose\r\ncompany I shot my biggest mountain ram. After the regiment was disbanded\r\nthe careers of certain of the men were diversified by odd incidents. Our\r\nrelations were of the friendliest, and, as they explained, they felt\r\n\"as if I was a father\" to them. The manifestations of this feeling were\r\nsometimes less attractive than the phrase sounded, as it was chiefly\r\nused by the few who were behaving like very bad children indeed. The\r\ngreat majority of the men when the regiment disbanded took up the\r\nbusiness of their lives where they had dropped it a few months\r\npreviously, and these men merely tried to help me or help one another\r\nas the occasion arose; no man ever had more cause to be proud of his\r\nregiment than I had of mine, both in war and in peace. But there was\r\na minority among them who in certain ways were unsuited for a life of\r\npeaceful regularity, although often enough they had been first-class\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nIt was from these men that letters came with a stereotyped opening which\r\nalways caused my heart to sink--\"Dear Colonel: I write you because I am\r\nin trouble.\" The trouble might take almost any form. One correspondent\r\ncontinued: \"I did not take the horse, but they say I did.\" Another\r\ncomplained that his mother-in-law had put him in jail for bigamy. In\r\nthe case of another the incident was more markworthy. I will call him\r\nGritto. He wrote me a letter beginning: \"Dear Colonel: I write you\r\nbecause I am in trouble. I have shot a lady in the eye. But, Colonel,\r\nI was not shooting at the lady. I was shooting at my wife,\" which he\r\napparently regarded as a sufficient excuse as between men of the world.\r\nI answered that I drew the line at shooting at ladies, and did not hear\r\nany more of the incident for several years.\r\n\r\nThen, while I was President, a member of the regiment, Major Llewellyn,\r\nwho was Federal District Attorney under me in New Mexico, wrote me a\r\nletter filled, as his letters usually were, with bits of interesting\r\ngossip about the comrades. It ran in part as follows: \"Since I last\r\nwrote you Comrade Ritchie has killed a man in Colorado. I understand\r\nthat the comrade was playing a poker game, and the man sat into the game\r\nand used such language that Comrade Ritchie had to shoot. Comrade Webb\r\nhas killed two men in Beaver, Arizona. Comrade Webb is in the Forest\r\nService, and the killing was in the line of professional duty. I was out\r\nat the penitentiary the other day and saw Comrade Gritto, who, you may\r\nremember, was put there for shooting his sister-in-law [this was the\r\nfirst information I had had as to the identity of the lady who was shot\r\nin the eye]. Since he was in there Comrade Boyne has run off to old\r\nMexico with his (Gritto's) wife, and the people of Grant County think he\r\nought to be let out.\" Evidently the sporting instincts of the people of\r\nGrant County had been roused, and they felt that, as Comrade Boyne had\r\nhad a fair start, the other comrade should be let out in order to see\r\nwhat would happen.\r\n\r\nThe men of the regiment always enthusiastically helped me when I was\r\nrunning for office. On one occasion Buck Taylor, of Texas, accompanied\r\nme on a trip and made a speech for me. The crowd took to his speech from\r\nthe beginning and so did I, until the peroration, which ran as follows:\r\n\"My fellow-citizens, vote for my Colonel! vote for my Colonel! _and he\r\nwill lead you, as he led us, like sheep to the slaughter_!\" This hardly\r\nseemed a tribute to my military skill; but it delighted the crowd, and\r\nas far as I could tell did me nothing but good.\r\n\r\nOn another tour, when I was running for Vice-President, a member of\r\nthe regiment who was along on the train got into a discussion with\r\na Populist editor who had expressed an unfavorable estimate of my\r\ncharacter, and in the course of the discussion shot the editor--not\r\nfatally. We had to leave him to be tried, and as he had no money I\r\nleft him $150 to hire counsel--having borrowed the money from Senator\r\nWolcott, of Colorado, who was also with me. After election I received\r\nfrom my friend a letter running: \"Dear Colonel: I find I will not have\r\nto use that $150 you lent me, as we have elected our candidate for\r\nDistrict Attorney. So I have used it to settle a horse transaction in\r\nwhich I unfortunately became involved.\" A few weeks later, however, I\r\nreceived a heartbroken letter setting forth the fact that the District\r\nAttorney--whom he evidently felt to be a cold-blooded formalist--had\r\nput him in jail. Then the affair dropped out of sight until two or three\r\nyears later, when as President I visited a town in another State,\r\nand the leaders of the delegation which received me included both my\r\ncorrespondent and the editor, now fast friends, and both of them ardent\r\nsupporters of mine.\r\n\r\nAt one of the regimental reunions a man, who had been an excellent\r\nsoldier, in greeting me mentioned how glad he was that the judge had let\r\nhim out in time to get to the reunion. I asked what was the matter, and\r\nhe replied with some surprise: \"Why, Colonel, don't you know I had\r\na difficulty with a gentleman, and . . . er . . . well, I killed the\r\ngentleman. But you can see that the judge thought it was all right or he\r\nwouldn't have let me go.\" Waiving the latter point, I said: \"How did it\r\nhappen? How did you do it?\" Misinterpreting my question as showing\r\nan interest only in the technique of the performance, the ex-puncher\r\nreplied: \"With a .38 on a .45 frame, Colonel.\" I chuckled over the\r\nanswer, and it became proverbial with my family and some of my friends,\r\nincluding Seth Bullock. When I was shot at Milwaukee, Seth Bullock wired\r\nan inquiry to which I responded that it was all right, that the weapon\r\nwas merely \"a .38 on a .45 frame.\" The telegram in some way became\r\npublic, and puzzled outsiders. By the way, both the men of my regiment\r\nand the friends I had made in the old days in the West were themselves a\r\nlittle puzzled at the interest shown in my making my speech after being\r\nshot. This was what they expected, what they accepted as the right thing\r\nfor a man to do under the circumstances, a thing the non-performance of\r\nwhich would have been discreditable rather than the performance being\r\ncreditable. They would not have expected a man to leave a battle, for\r\ninstance, because of being wounded in such fashion; and they saw no\r\nreason why he should abandon a less important and less risky duty.\r\n\r\nOne of the best soldiers of my regiment was a huge man whom I made\r\nmarshal of a Rocky Mountain State. He had spent his hot and lusty youth\r\non the frontier during its viking age, and at that time had naturally\r\ntaken part in incidents which seemed queer to men \"accustomed to die\r\ndecently of zymotic diseases.\" I told him that an effort would doubtless\r\nbe made to prevent his confirmation by the Senate, and therefore that\r\nI wanted to know all the facts in his case. Had he played faro? He had;\r\nbut it was when everybody played faro, and he had never played a brace\r\ngame. Had he killed anybody? Yes, but it was in Dodge City on occasions\r\nwhen he was deputy marshal or town marshal, at a time when Dodge City,\r\nnow the most peaceful of communities, was the toughest town on the\r\ncontinent, and crowded with man-killing outlaws and road agents; and he\r\nproduced telegrams from judges of high character testifying to the need\r\nof the actions he had taken. Finally I said: \"Now, Ben, how did you\r\nlose that half of your ear?\" To which, looking rather shy, he responded:\r\n\"Well, Colonel, it was bit off.\" \"How did it happen, Ben?\" \"Well, you\r\nsee, I was sent to arrest a gentleman, and him and me mixed it up, and\r\nhe bit off my ear.\" \"What did you do to the gentleman, Ben?\" And Ben,\r\nlooking more coy than ever, responded: \"Well, Colonel, we broke about\r\neven!\" I forebore to inquire what variety of mayhem he had committed on\r\nthe \"gentleman.\" After considerable struggle I got him confirmed by\r\nthe Senate, and he made one of the best marshals in the entire service,\r\nexactly as he had already made one of the best soldiers in the regiment;\r\nand I never wish to see a better citizen, nor a man in whom I would more\r\nimplicitly trust in every way.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1900, I was nominated for Vice-President, I was sent by the\r\nNational Committee on a trip into the States of the high plains and the\r\nRocky Mountains. These had all gone overwhelmingly for Mr. Bryan on\r\nthe free-silver issue four years previously, and it was thought that I,\r\nbecause of my knowledge of and acquaintanceship with the people, might\r\naccomplish something towards bringing them back into line. It was\r\nan interesting trip, and the monotony usually attendant upon such a\r\ncampaign of political speaking was diversified in vivid fashion by\r\noccasional hostile audiences. One or two of the meetings ended in riots.\r\nOne meeting was finally broken up by a mob; everybody fought so that the\r\nspeaking had to stop. Soon after this we reached another town where we\r\nwere told there might be trouble. Here the local committee included an\r\nold and valued friend, a \"two-gun\" man of repute, who was not in the\r\nleast quarrelsome, but who always kept his word. We marched round to\r\nthe local opera-house, which was packed with a mass of men, many of them\r\nrather rough-looking. My friend the two-gun man sat immediately behind\r\nme, a gun on each hip, his arms folded, looking at the audience; fixing\r\nhis gaze with instant intentness on any section of the house from which\r\nthere came so much as a whisper. The audience listened to me with\r\nrapt attention. At the end, with a pride in my rhetorical powers which\r\nproceeded from a misunderstanding of the situation, I remarked to the\r\nchairman: \"I held that audience well; there wasn't an interruption.\" To\r\nwhich the chairman replied: \"Interruption? Well, I guess not! Seth had\r\nsent round word that if any son of a gun peeped he'd kill him!\"\r\n\r\nThere was one bit of frontier philosophy which I should like to see\r\nimitated in more advanced communities. Certain crimes of revolting\r\nbaseness and cruelty were never forgiven. But in the case of ordinary\r\noffenses, the man who had served his term and who then tried to make\r\ngood was given a fair chance; and of course this was equally true of\r\nthe women. Every one who has studied the subject at all is only too\r\nwell aware that the world offsets the readiness with which it condones\r\na crime for which a man escapes punishment, by its unforgiving\r\nrelentlessness to the often far less guilty man who _is_ punished,\r\nand who therefore has made his atonement. On the frontier, if the man\r\nhonestly tried to behave himself there was generally a disposition to\r\ngive him fair play and a decent show. Several of the men I knew and whom\r\nI particularly liked came in this class. There was one such man in my\r\nregiment, a man who had served a term for robbery under arms, and who\r\nhad atoned for it by many years of fine performance of duty. I put him\r\nin a high official position, and no man under me rendered better service\r\nto the State, nor was there any man whom, as soldier, as civil officer,\r\nas citizen, and as friend, I valued and respected--and now value and\r\nrespect--more.\r\n\r\nNow I suppose some good people will gather from this that I favor men\r\nwho commit crimes. I certainly do not favor them. I have not a\r\nparticle of sympathy with the sentimentality--as I deem it, the\r\nmawkishness--which overflows with foolish pity for the criminal and\r\ncares not at all for the victim of the criminal. I am glad to see\r\nwrong-doers punished. The punishment is an absolute necessity from the\r\nstandpoint of society; and I put the reformation of the criminal second\r\nto the welfare of society. But I do desire to see the man or woman\r\nwho has paid the penalty and who wishes to reform given a helping\r\nhand--surely every one of us who knows his own heart must know that he\r\ntoo may stumble, and should be anxious to help his brother or sister who\r\nhas stumbled. When the criminal has been punished, if he then shows a\r\nsincere desire to lead a decent and upright life, he should be given the\r\nchance, he should be helped and not hindered; and if he makes good, he\r\nshould receive that respect from others which so often aids in creating\r\nself-respect--the most invaluable of all possessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nAPPLIED IDEALISM\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1899 I was appointed by President Harrison Civil\r\nService Commissioner. For nearly five years I had not been very\r\nactive in political life; although I had done some routine work in the\r\norganization and had made campaign speeches, and in 1886 had run for\r\nMayor of New York against Abram S. Hewitt, Democrat, and Henry George,\r\nIndependent, and had been defeated.\r\n\r\nI served six years as Civil Service Commissioner--four years under\r\nPresident Harrison and then two years under President Cleveland. I\r\nwas treated by both Presidents with the utmost consideration. Among my\r\nfellow-Commissioners there was at one time ex-Governor Hugh Thompson, of\r\nSouth Carolina, and at another time John R. Proctor, of Kentucky. They\r\nwere Democrats and ex-Confederate soldiers. I became deeply attached to\r\nboth, and we stood shoulder to shoulder in every contest in which the\r\nCommission was forced to take part.\r\n\r\nCivil Service Reform had two sides. There was, first, the effort to\r\nsecure a more efficient administration of the public service, and,\r\nsecond, the even more important effort to withdraw the administrative\r\noffices of the Government from the domain of spoils politics, and\r\nthereby cut out of American political life a fruitful source of\r\ncorruption and degradation. The spoils theory of politics is that\r\npublic office is so much plunder which the victorious political party is\r\nentitled to appropriate to the use of its adherents. Under this system\r\nthe work of the Government was often done well even in those days, when\r\nCivil Service Reform was only an experiment, because the man running an\r\noffice if himself an able and far-sighted man, knew that inefficiency\r\nin administration would be visited on his head in the long run, and\r\ntherefore insisted upon most of his subordinates doing good work; and,\r\nmoreover, the men appointed under the spoils system were necessarily\r\nmen of a certain initiative and power, because those who lacked these\r\nqualities were not able to shoulder themselves to the front. Yet there\r\nwere many flagrant instances of inefficiency, where a powerful chief\r\nquartered friend, adherent, or kinsman upon the Government. Moreover,\r\nthe necessarily haphazard nature of the employment, the need of\r\nobtaining and holding the office by service wholly unconnected with\r\nofficial duty, inevitably tended to lower the standard of public\r\nmorality, alike among the office-holders and among the politicians who\r\nrendered party service with the hope of reward in office. Indeed, the\r\ndoctrine that \"To the victor belong the spoils,\" the cynical battle-cry\r\nof the spoils politician in America for the sixty years preceding my own\r\nentrance into public life, is so nakedly vicious that few right-thinking\r\nmen of trained mind defend it. To appoint, promote, reduce, and\r\nexpel from the public service, letter-carriers, stenographers, women\r\ntypewriters, clerks, because of the politics of themselves or their\r\nfriends, without regard to their own service, is, from the standpoint of\r\nthe people at large, as foolish and degrading as it is wicked.\r\n\r\nSuch being the case, it would seem at first sight extraordinary that\r\nit should be so difficult to uproot the system. Unfortunately, it was\r\npermitted to become habitual and traditional in American life, so that\r\nthe conception of public office as something to be used primarily for\r\nthe good of the dominant political party became ingrained in the mind\r\nof the average American, and he grew so accustomed to the whole process\r\nthat it seemed part of the order of nature. Not merely the politicians\r\nbut the bulk of the people accepted this in a matter-of-course way as\r\nthe only proper attitude. There were plenty of communities where the\r\ncitizens themselves did not think it natural, or indeed proper, that\r\nthe Post-Office should be held by a man belonging to the defeated\r\nparty. Moreover, unless both sides were forbidden to use the offices for\r\npurposes of political reward, the side that did use them possessed\r\nsuch an advantage over the other that in the long run it was out of the\r\nquestion for the other not to follow the bad example that had been set.\r\nEach party profited by the offices when in power, and when in opposition\r\neach party insincerely denounced its opponents for doing exactly what it\r\nitself had done and intended again to do.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary, in order to remedy the evil, both gradually to change\r\nthe average citizen's mental attitude toward the question, and also to\r\nsecure proper laws and proper administration of the laws. The work is\r\nfar from finished even yet. There are still masses of office-holders\r\nwho can be used by an unscrupulous Administration to debauch political\r\nconventions and fraudulently overcome public sentiment, especially in\r\nthe \"rotten borough\" districts--those where the party is not strong,\r\nand where the office-holders in consequence have a disproportionate\r\ninfluence. This was done by the Republican Administration in 1912, to\r\nthe ruin of the Republican party. Moreover, there are numbers of States\r\nand municipalities where very little has as yet been done to do away\r\nwith the spoils system. But in the National Government scores of\r\nthousands of offices have been put under the merit system, chiefly\r\nthrough the action of the National Civil Service Commission.\r\n\r\nThe use of Government offices as patronage is a handicap difficult\r\nto overestimate from the standpoint of those who strive to get good\r\ngovernment. Any effort for reform of any sort, National, State, or\r\nmunicipal, results in the reformers immediately finding themselves face\r\nto face with an organized band of drilled mercenaries who are paid out\r\nof the public chest to train themselves with such skill that ordinary\r\ngood citizens when they meet them at the polls are in much the position\r\nof militia matched against regular troops. Yet these citizens themselves\r\nsupport and pay their opponents in such a way that they are drilled\r\nto overthrow the very men who support them. Civil Service Reform is\r\ndesigned primarily to give the average American citizen a fair chance in\r\npolitics, to give to this citizen the same weight in politics that the\r\n\"ward heeler\" has.\r\n\r\nPatronage does not really help a party. It helps the bosses to get\r\ncontrol of the machinery of the party--as in 1912 was true of the\r\nRepublican party--but it does not help the party. On the average, the\r\nmost sweeping party victories in our history have been won when the\r\npatronage was against the victors. All that the patronage does is\r\nto help the worst element in the party retain control of the party\r\norganization. Two of the evil elements in our Government against which\r\ngood citizens have to contend are, 1, the lack of continuous activity\r\non the part of these good citizens themselves, and, 2, the ever-present\r\nactivity of those who have only an evil self-interest in political\r\nlife. It is difficult to interest the average citizen in any particular\r\nmovement to the degree of getting him to take an efficient part in it.\r\nHe wishes the movement well, but he will not, or often cannot, take\r\nthe time and the trouble to serve it efficiently; and this whether\r\nhe happens to be a mechanic or a banker, a telegraph operator or a\r\nstorekeeper. He has his own interests, his own business, and it is\r\ndifficult for him to spare the time to go around to the primaries, to\r\nsee to the organization, to see to getting out the vote--in short, to\r\nattend to all the thousand details of political management.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the spoils system breeds a class of men whose\r\nfinancial interest it is to take this necessary time and trouble. They\r\nare paid for so doing, and they are paid out of the public chest.\r\nUnder the spoils system a man is appointed to an ordinary clerical or\r\nministerial position in the municipal, Federal, or State government, not\r\nprimarily because he is expected to be a good servant, but because he\r\nhas rendered help to some big boss or to the henchman of some big boss.\r\nHis stay in office depends not upon how he performs service, but upon\r\nhow he retains his influence in the party. This necessarily means that\r\nhis attention to the interests of the public at large, even though real,\r\nis secondary to his devotion to his organization, or to the interest of\r\nthe ward leader who put him in his place. So he and his fellows attend\r\nto politics, not once a year, not two or three times a year, like the\r\naverage citizen, but every day in the year. It is the one thing that\r\nthey talk of, for it is their bread and butter. They plan about it and\r\nthey scheme about it. They do it because it is their business. I do not\r\nblame them in the least. I blame us, the people, for we ought to make\r\nit clear as a bell that the business of serving the people in one of the\r\nordinary ministerial Government positions, which have nothing to do\r\nwith deciding the policy of the Government, should have no necessary\r\nconnection with the management of primaries, of caucuses, and\r\nof nominating conventions. As a result of our wrong thinking and\r\nsupineness, we American citizens tend to breed a mass of men whose\r\ninterests in governmental matters are often adverse to ours, who are\r\nthoroughly drilled, thoroughly organized, who make their livelihood\r\nout of politics, and who frequently make their livelihood out of\r\nbad politics. They know every little twist and turn, no matter how\r\nintricate, in the politics of their several wards, and when election\r\nday comes the ordinary citizen who has merely the interest that all good\r\nmen, all decent citizens, should have in political life, finds himself\r\nas helpless before these men as if he were a solitary volunteer in the\r\npresence of a band of drilled mercenaries on a field of battle. There\r\nare a couple of hundred thousand Federal offices, not to speak of State\r\nand municipal offices. The men who fill these offices, and the men who\r\nwish to fill them, within and without the dominant party for the time\r\nbeing, make a regular army, whose interest it is that the system\r\nof bread-and-butter politics shall continue. Against their concrete\r\ninterest we have merely the generally unorganized sentiment of the\r\ncommunity in favor of putting things on a decent basis. The large number\r\nof men who believe vaguely in good are pitted against the smaller but\r\nstill larger number of men whose interest it often becomes to act\r\nvery concretely and actively for evil; and it is small wonder that the\r\nstruggle is doubtful.\r\n\r\nDuring my six years' service as Commissioner the field of the merit\r\nsystem was extended at the expense of the spoils system so as to include\r\nseveral times the number of offices that had originally been included.\r\nGenerally this was done by the introduction of competitive entrance\r\nexaminations; sometimes, as in the Navy-Yards, by a system of\r\nregistration. This of itself was good work.\r\n\r\nEven better work was making the law efficient and genuine where it\r\napplied. As was inevitable in the introduction of such a system, there\r\nwas at first only partial success in its application. For instance,\r\nit applied to the ordinary employees in the big custom-houses and\r\npost-offices, but not to the heads of these offices. A number of the\r\nheads of the offices were slippery politicians of a low moral grade,\r\nthemselves appointed under the spoils system, and anxious, directly\r\nor indirectly, to break down the merit system and to pay their own\r\npolitical debts by appointing their henchmen and supporters to the\r\npositions under them. Occasionally these men acted with open and naked\r\nbrutality. Ordinarily they sought by cunning to evade the law. The Civil\r\nService Reformers, on the other hand, were in most cases not much used\r\nto practical politics, and were often well-nigh helpless when pitted\r\nagainst veteran professional politicians. In consequence I found at the\r\nbeginning of my experiences that there were many offices in which the\r\nexecution of the law was a sham. This was very damaging, because it\r\nencouraged the politicians to assault the law everywhere, and, on the\r\nother hand, made good people feel that the law was not worth while\r\ndefending.\r\n\r\nThe first effort of myself and my colleagues was to secure the genuine\r\nenforcement of the law. In this we succeeded after a number of lively\r\nfights. But of course in these fights we were obliged to strike a large\r\nnumber of influential politicians, some of them in Congress, some of\r\nthem the supporters and backers of men who were in Congress. Accordingly\r\nwe soon found ourselves engaged in a series of contests with prominent\r\nSenators and Congressmen. There were a number of Senators and\r\nCongressmen--men like Congressman (afterwards Senator) H. C. Lodge, of\r\nMassachusetts; Senator Cushman K. Davis, of Minnesota; Senator Orville\r\nH. Platt, of Connecticut; Senator Cockrell, of Missouri; Congressman\r\n(afterwards President) McKinley, of Ohio, and Congressman Dargan,\r\nof South Carolina--who abhorred the business of the spoilsman, who\r\nefficiently and resolutely championed the reform at every turn, and\r\nwithout whom the whole reform would certainly have failed. But there\r\nwere plenty of other Senators and Congressmen who hated the whole reform\r\nand everything concerned with it and everybody who championed it;\r\nand sometimes, to use a legal phrase, their hatred was for cause,\r\nand sometimes it was peremptory--that is, sometimes the Commission\r\ninterfered with their most efficient, and incidentally most corrupt and\r\nunscrupulous, supporters, and at other times, where there was no such\r\ninterference, a man nevertheless had an innate dislike of anything\r\nthat tended to decency in government. These men were always waging war\r\nagainst us, and they usually had the more or less open support of a\r\ncertain number of Government officials, from Cabinet officers down. The\r\nSenators and Congressmen in question opposed us in many different ways.\r\nSometimes, for instance, they had committees appointed to investigate\r\nus--during my public career without and within office I grew accustomed\r\nto accept appearances before investigating committees as part of\r\nthe natural order of things. Sometimes they tried to cut off the\r\nappropriation for the Commission.\r\n\r\nOccasionally we would bring to terms these Senators or Congressmen\r\nwho fought the Commission by the simple expedient of not holding\r\nexaminations in their districts. This always brought frantic appeals\r\nfrom their constituents, and we would explain that unfortunately the\r\nappropriations had been cut, so that we could not hold examinations in\r\nevery district, and that obviously we could not neglect the districts\r\nof those Congressmen who believed in the reform and therefore in the\r\nexaminations. The constituents then turned their attention to the\r\nCongressman, and the result was that in the long run we obtained\r\nsufficient money to enable us to do our work. On the whole, the\r\nmost prominent leaders favored us. Any man who is the head of a big\r\ndepartment, if he has any fitness at all, wishes to see that department\r\nrun well; and a very little practical experience shows him that\r\nit cannot be run well if he must make his appointments to please\r\nspoilsmongering politicians. As with almost every reform that I have\r\never undertaken, most of the opposition took the guise of shrewd\r\nslander. Our opponents relied chiefly on downright misrepresentation of\r\nwhat it was that we were trying to accomplish, and of our methods, acts,\r\nand personalities. I had more than one lively encounter with the authors\r\nand sponsors of these misrepresentations, which at the time were full of\r\ninterest to me. But it would be a dreary thing now to go over the record\r\nof exploded mendacity, or to expose the meanness and malice shown by\r\nsome men of high official position. A favorite argument was to call\r\nthe reform Chinese, because the Chinese had constructed an inefficient\r\ngovernmental system based in part on the theory of written competitive\r\nexaminations. The argument was simple. There had been written\r\nexaminations in China; it was proposed to establish written examinations\r\nin the United States; therefore the proposed system was Chinese. The\r\nargument might have been applied still further. For instance, the\r\nChinese had used gunpowder for centuries; gunpowder is used in\r\nSpringfield rifles; therefore Springfield rifles were Chinese. One\r\nargument is quite as logical as the other. It was impossible to answer\r\nevery falsehood about the system. But it was possible to answer certain\r\nfalsehoods, especially when uttered by some Senator or Congressman of\r\nnote. Usually these false statements took the form of assertions that\r\nwe had asked preposterous questions of applicants. At times they also\r\nincluded the assertion that we credited people to districts where they\r\ndid not live; this simply meaning that these persons were not known to\r\nthe active ward politicians of those districts.\r\n\r\nOne opponent with whom we had a rather lively tilt was a Republican\r\nCongressman from Ohio, Mr. Grosvenor, one of the floor leaders. Mr.\r\nGrosvenor made his attack in the House, and enumerated our sins in\r\npicturesque rather than accurate fashion. There was a Congressional\r\ncommittee investigating us at the time, and on my next appearance before\r\nthem I asked that Mr. Grosvenor be requested to meet me before the\r\ncommittee. Mr. Grosvenor did not take up the challenge for several\r\nweeks, until it was announced that I was leaving for my ranch in Dakota;\r\nwhereupon, deeming it safe, he wrote me a letter expressing his ardent\r\nwish that I should appear before the committee to meet him. I promptly\r\ncanceled my ticket, waited, and met him. He proved to be a person of\r\nhappily treacherous memory, so that the simple expedient of arranging\r\nhis statements in pairs was sufficient to reduce him to confusion. For\r\ninstance, he had been trapped into making the unwary remark, \"I do not\r\nwant to repeal the Civil Service Law, and I never said so.\" I produced\r\nthe following extract from one of his speeches: \"I will vote not only to\r\nstrike out this provision, but I will vote to repeal the whole law.\" To\r\nthis he merely replied that there was \"no inconsistency between those\r\ntwo statements.\" He asserted that \"Rufus P. Putnam, fraudulently\r\ncredited to Washington County, Ohio, never lived in Washington County,\r\nOhio, or in my Congressional district, or in Ohio as far as I know.\"\r\nWe produced a letter which, thanks to a beneficent Providence, he had\r\nhimself written about Mr. Rufus P. Putnam, in which he said: \"Mr. Rufus\r\nP. Putnam is a legal resident of my district and has relatives living\r\nthere now.\" He explained, first, that he had not written the letter;\r\nsecond, that he had forgotten he had written the letter; and, third,\r\nthat he was grossly deceived when he wrote it. He said: \"I have not\r\nbeen informed of one applicant who has found a place in the classified\r\nservice from my district.\" We confronted him with the names of eight. He\r\nlooked them over and said, \"Yes, the eight men are living in my district\r\nas now constituted,\" but added that his district had been gerrymandered\r\nso that he could no longer tell who did and who didn't live in it. When\r\nI started further to question him, he accused me of a lack of humor in\r\nnot appreciating that his statements were made \"in a jesting way,\" and\r\nthen announced that \"a Congressman making a speech on the floor of the\r\nHouse of Representatives was perhaps in a little different position\r\nfrom a witness on the witness stand\"--a frank admission that he did not\r\nconsider exactitude of statement necessary when he was speaking as a\r\nCongressman. Finally he rose with great dignity and said that it was his\r\n\"constitutional right\" not to be questioned elsewhere as to what he said\r\non the floor of the House of Representatives; and accordingly he left\r\nthe delighted committee to pursue its investigations without further aid\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nA more important opponent was the then Democratic leader of the Senate,\r\nMr. Gorman. In a speech attacking the Commission Mr. Gorman described\r\nwith moving pathos how a friend of his, \"a bright young man from\r\nBaltimore,\" a Sunday-school scholar, well recommended by his pastor,\r\nwished to be a letter-carrier; and how he went before us to be examined.\r\nThe first question we asked him, said Mr. Gorman, was the shortest route\r\nfrom Baltimore to China, to which the \"bright young man\" responded that\r\nhe didn't want to go to China, and had never studied up that route.\r\nThereupon, said Mr. Gorman, we asked him all about the steamship lines\r\nfrom the United States to Europe, then branched him off into geology,\r\ntried him in chemistry, and finally turned him down.\r\n\r\nApparently Mr. Gorman did not know that we kept full records of our\r\nexaminations. I at once wrote to him stating that I had carefully looked\r\nthrough all our examination papers and had not been able to find one\r\nquestion even remotely resembling any of these questions which he\r\nalleged had been asked, and that I would be greatly obliged if he would\r\ngive me the name of the \"bright young man\" who had deceived him.\r\n\r\nHowever, that \"bright young man\" remained permanently without a name.\r\nI also asked Mr. Gorman, if he did not wish to give us the name of\r\nhis informant, to give us the date of the examination in which he was\r\nsupposed to have taken part; and I offered, if he would send down a\r\nrepresentative to look through our files, to give him all the aid we\r\ncould in his effort to discover any such questions. But Mr. Gorman, not\r\nhitherto known as a sensitive soul, expressed himself as so shocked\r\nat the thought that the veracity of the \"bright young man\" should be\r\ndoubted that he could not bring himself to answer my letter. So I made\r\na public statement to the effect that no such questions had ever been\r\nasked. Mr. Gorman brooded over this; and during the next session of\r\nCongress he rose and complained that he had received a very \"impudent\"\r\nletter from me (my letter was a respectful note calling attention to\r\nthe fact that, if he wished, he could by personal examination satisfy\r\nhimself that his statements had no foundation in fact). He further\r\nstated that he had been \"cruelly\" called to account by me because he\r\nhad been endeavoring to right a \"great wrong\" that the Civil Service\r\nCommission had committed; but he never, then or afterwards, furnished\r\nany clue to the identity of that child of his fondest fancy, the bright\r\nyoung man without a name.[*]\r\n\r\n     [*] This is a condensation of a speech I at the time made to\r\n     the St. Louis Civil Service Reform Association. Senator\r\n     Gorman was then the Senate leader of the party that had just\r\n     been victorious in the Congressional elections.\r\n\r\nThe incident is of note chiefly as shedding light on the mental make-up\r\nof the man who at the time was one of the two or three most influential\r\nleaders of the Democratic party. Mr. Gorman had been Mr. Cleveland's\r\nparty manager in the Presidential campaign, and was the Democratic\r\nleader in Congress. It seemed extraordinary that he should be so\r\nreckless as to make statements with no foundation in fact, which he\r\nmight have known that I would not permit to pass unchallenged. Then,\r\nas now, the ordinary newspaper, in New York and elsewhere, was quite as\r\nreckless in its misstatements of fact about public men and measures; but\r\nfor a man in Mr. Gorman's position of responsible leadership such action\r\nseemed hardly worth while. However, it is at least to be said for\r\nMr. Gorman that he was not trying by falsehood to take away any man's\r\ncharacter. It would be well for writers and speakers to bear in mind\r\nthe remark of Pudd'nhead Wilson to the effect that while there are nine\r\nhundred and ninety-nine kinds of falsehood, the only kind specifically\r\ncondemned in Scripture, just as murder, theft, and adultery are\r\ncondemned, is bearing false witness against one's neighbor.\r\n\r\nOne of the worst features of the old spoils system was the ruthless\r\ncruelty and brutality it so often bred in the treatment of faithful\r\npublic servants without political influence. Life is hard enough and\r\ncruel enough at best, and this is as true of public service as of\r\nprivate service. Under no system will it be possible to do away with all\r\nfavoritism and brutality and meanness and malice. But at least we can\r\ntry to minimize the exhibition of these qualities. I once came across\r\na case in Washington which very keenly excited my sympathy. Under an\r\nAdministration prior to the one with which I was connected a lady had\r\nbeen ousted from a Government position. She came to me to see if she\r\ncould be reinstated. (This was not possible, but by active work I did\r\nget her put back in a somewhat lower position, and this only by an\r\nappeal to the sympathy of a certain official.) She was so pallid and so\r\ncareworn that she excited my sympathy and I made inquiries about\r\nher. She was a poor woman with two children, a widow. She and her two\r\nchildren were in actual want. She could barely keep the two children\r\ndecently clad, and she could not give them the food growing children\r\nneed. Three years before she had been employed in a bureau in a\r\ndepartment of Washington, doing her work faithfully, at a salary of\r\nabout $800. It was enough to keep her and her two children in clothing,\r\nfood, and shelter. One day the chief of the bureau called her up and\r\ntold her he was very sorry that he had to dismiss her. In great\r\ndistress she asked him why; she thought that she had been doing her work\r\nsatisfactorily. He answered her that she had been doing well, and that\r\nhe wished very much that he could keep her, that he would do so if he\r\npossibly could, but that he could not; for a certain Senator, giving his\r\nname, a very influential member of the Senate, had demanded her place\r\nfor a friend of his who had influence. The woman told the bureau chief\r\nthat it meant turning her out to starve. She had been thirteen or\r\nfourteen years in the public service; she had lost all touch with her\r\nfriends in her native State; dismissal meant absolute want for her and\r\nher children. On this the chief, who was a kind man, said he would not\r\nhave her turned out, and sent her back to her work.\r\n\r\nBut three weeks afterwards he called her up again and told her he could\r\nnot say how sorry he was, but the thing had to be done. The Senator had\r\nbeen around in person to know why the change had not been made, and had\r\ntold the chief that he would be himself removed if the place were not\r\ngiven him. The Senator was an extremely influential man. His wants had\r\nto be attended to, and the woman had to go. And go she did, and turned\r\nout she was, to suffer with her children and to starve outright, or to\r\nlive in semi-starvation, just as might befall. I do not blame the bureau\r\nchief, who hated to do what he did, although he lacked the courage to\r\nrefuse; I do not even very much blame the Senator, who did not know\r\nthe hardship that he was causing, and who had been calloused by long\r\ntraining in the spoils system; but this system, a system which permits\r\nand encourages such deeds, is a system of brutal iniquity.\r\n\r\nAny man accustomed to dealing with practical politics can with\r\ndifficulty keep a straight face when he reads or listens to some of the\r\narguments advanced against Civil Service Reform. One of these arguments,\r\na favorite with machine politicians, takes the form of an appeal to\r\n\"party loyalty\" in filling minor offices. Why, again and again these\r\nvery same machine politicians take just as good care of henchmen of\r\nthe opposite party as of those of their own party. In the underworld of\r\npolitics the closest ties are sometimes those which knit together the\r\nactive professional workers of opposite political parties. A friend\r\nof mine in the New York Legislature--the hero of the alpha and omega\r\nincident--once remarked to me: \"When you have been in public life a\r\nlittle longer, Mr. Roosevelt, you will understand that there are no\r\npolitics in politics.\" In the politics to which he was referring this\r\nremark could be taken literally.\r\n\r\nAnother illustration of this truth was incidentally given me, at about\r\nthe same time, by an acquaintance, a Tammany man named Costigan, a good\r\nfellow according to his lights. I had been speaking to him of a fight in\r\none of the New York downtown districts, a Democratic district in which\r\nthe Republican party was in a hopeless minority, and, moreover,\r\nwas split into the Half-Breed and Stalwart factions. It had been an\r\ninteresting fight in more than one way. For instance, the Republican\r\nparty, at the general election, polled something like five hundred\r\nand fifty votes, and yet at the primary the two factions polled\r\nseven hundred and twenty-five all told. The sum of the parts was thus\r\nconsiderably greater than the whole. There had been other little details\r\nthat made the contest worthy of note. The hall in which the primary was\r\nheld had been hired by the Stalwarts from a conscientious gentleman. To\r\nhim the Half-Breeds applied to know whether they could not hire the hall\r\naway from their opponents, and offered him a substantial money advance.\r\nThe conscientious gentleman replied that his word was as good as his\r\nbond, that he had hired the hall to the Stalwarts, and that it must\r\nbe theirs. But he added that he was willing to hire the doorway to\r\nthe Half-Breeds if they paid him the additional sum of money they had\r\nmentioned. The bargain was struck, and the meeting of the hostile hosts\r\nwas spirited, when the men who had rented the doorway sought to bar the\r\npath of the men who had rented the hall. I was asking my friend Costigan\r\nabout the details of the struggle, as he seemed thoroughly acquainted\r\nwith them, and he smiled good-naturedly over my surprise at there having\r\nbeen more votes cast than there were members of the party in the whole\r\ndistrict. Said I, \"Mr. Costigan, you seem to have a great deal of\r\nknowledge about this; how did it happen?\" To which he replied, \"Come\r\nnow, Mr. Roosevelt, you know it's the same gang that votes in all the\r\nprimaries.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for most of the opposition to the reform. There was, however,\r\nsome honest and at least partially justifiable opposition both to\r\ncertain of the methods advocated by Civil Service Reformers and to\r\ncertain of the Civil Service Reformers themselves. The pet shibboleths\r\nof the opponents of the reform were that the system we proposed to\r\nintroduce would give rise to mere red-tape bureaucracy, and that the\r\nreformers were pharisees. Neither statement was true. Each statement\r\ncontained some truth.\r\n\r\nIf men are not to be appointed by favoritism, wise or unwise, honest or\r\ndishonest, they must be appointed in some automatic way, which generally\r\nmeans by competitive examination. The easiest kind of competitive\r\nexamination is an examination in writing. This is entirely appropriate\r\nfor certain classes of work, for lawyers, stenographers, typewriters,\r\nclerks, mathematicians, and assistants in an astronomical observatory,\r\nfor instance. It is utterly inappropriate for carpenters, detectives,\r\nand mounted cattle inspectors along the Rio Grande--to instance\r\nthree types of employment as to which I had to do battle to prevent\r\nwell-meaning bureaucrats from insisting on written competitive entrance\r\nexaminations. It would be quite possible to hold a very good competitive\r\nexamination for mounted cattle inspectors by means of practical tests\r\nin brand reading and shooting with rifle and revolver, in riding\r\n\"mean\" horses and in roping and throwing steers. I did my best to have\r\nexaminations of this kind instituted, but my proposal was of precisely\r\nthe type which most shocks the routine official mind, and I was never\r\nable to get it put into practical effect.\r\n\r\nThe important point, and the point most often forgotten by zealous\r\nCivil Service Reformers, was to remember that the routine competitive\r\nexamination was merely a means to an end. It did not always produce\r\nideal results. But it was normally better than a system of appointments\r\nfor spoils purposes; it sometimes worked out very well indeed; and in\r\nmost big governmental offices it not only gave satisfactory results,\r\nbut was the only system under which good results could be obtained. For\r\ninstance, when I was Police Commissioner we appointed some two thousand\r\npolicemen at one time. It was utterly impossible for the Commissioners\r\neach to examine personally the six or eight thousand applicants.\r\nTherefore they had to be appointed either on the recommendation of\r\noutsiders or else by written competitive examination. The latter\r\nmethod--the one we adopted--was infinitely preferable. We held a rigid\r\nphysical and moral pass examination, and then, among those who passed,\r\nwe held a written competitive examination, requiring only the knowledge\r\nthat any good primary common school education would meet--that is, a\r\ntest of ordinary intelligence and simple mental training. Occasionally\r\na man who would have been a good officer failed, and occasionally a man\r\nwho turned out to be a bad officer passed; but, as a rule, the men with\r\nintelligence sufficient to enable them to answer the questions were of a\r\ntype very distinctly above that of those who failed.\r\n\r\nThe answers returned to some of the questions gave an illuminating idea\r\nof the intelligence of those answering them. For instance, one of our\r\nquestions in a given examination was a request to name five of the New\r\nEngland States. One competitor, obviously of foreign birth, answered:\r\n\"England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and Cork.\" His neighbor, who\r\nhad probably looked over his shoulder but who had North of Ireland\r\nprejudices, made the same answer except that he substituted Belfast\r\nfor Cork. A request for a statement as to the life of Abraham Lincoln\r\nelicited, among other less startling pieces of information, the fact\r\nthat many of the applicants thought that he was a general in the Civil\r\nWar; several thought that he was President of the Confederate States;\r\nthree thought he had been assassinated by Jefferson Davis, one by Thomas\r\nJefferson, one by Garfield, several by Guiteau, and one by Ballington\r\nBooth--the last representing a memory of the fact that he had been shot\r\nby a man named Booth, to whose surname the writer added the name with\r\nwhich he was most familiar in connection therewith. A request to name\r\nfive of the States that seceded in 1861 received answers that included\r\nalmost every State in the Union. It happened to be at the time of the\r\nsilver agitation in the West, and the Rocky Mountain States accordingly\r\nfigured in a large percentage of the answers. Some of the men thought\r\nthat Chicago was on the Pacific Ocean. Others, in answer to a query as\r\nto who was the head of the United States Government, wavered between\r\nmyself and Recorder Goff; one brilliant genius, for inscrutable reasons,\r\nplaced the leadership in the New York Fire Department. Now of course\r\nsome of the men who answered these questions wrong were nevertheless\r\nquite capable of making good policemen; but it is fair to assume that\r\non the average the candidate who has a rudimentary knowledge of the\r\ngovernment, geography, and history of his country is a little better\r\nfitted, in point of intelligence, to be a policeman than the one who has\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nTherefore I felt convinced, after full experience, that as regards very\r\nlarge classes of public servants by far the best way to choose the men\r\nfor appointment was by means of written competitive examination. But\r\nI absolutely split off from the bulk of my professional Civil Service\r\nReform friends when they advocated written competitive examinations for\r\npromotion. In the Police Department I found these examinations a serious\r\nhandicap in the way of getting the best men promoted, and never in any\r\noffice did I find that the written competitive promotion examination did\r\nany good. The reason for a written competitive entrance examination is\r\nthat it is impossible for the head of the office, or the candidate's\r\nprospective immediate superior, himself to know the average candidate\r\nor to test his ability. But when once in office the best way to test any\r\nman's ability is by long experience in seeing him actually at work.\r\nHis promotion should depend upon the judgment formed of him by his\r\nsuperiors.\r\n\r\nSo much for the objections to the examinations. Now for the objections\r\nto the men who advocated the reform. As a rule these men were\r\nhigh-minded and disinterested. Certain of them, men like the leaders\r\nin the Maryland and Indiana Reform Associations, for instances,\r\nMessrs. Bonaparte and Rose, Foulke and Swift, added common sense, broad\r\nsympathy, and practical efficiency to their high-mindedness. But in New\r\nYork, Philadelphia, and Boston there really was a certain mental and\r\nmoral thinness among very many of the leaders in the Civil Service\r\nReform movement. It was this quality which made them so profoundly\r\nantipathetic to vigorous and intensely human people of the stamp of\r\nmy friend Joe Murray--who, as I have said, always felt that my Civil\r\nService Reform affiliations formed the one blot on an otherwise\r\nexcellent public record. The Civil Service Reform movement was one from\r\nabove downwards, and the men who took the lead in it were not men who as\r\na rule possessed a very profound sympathy with or understanding of the\r\nways of thought and life of their average fellow-citizen. They were not\r\nmen who themselves desired to be letter-carriers or clerks or policemen,\r\nor to have their friends appointed to these positions. Having no\r\ntemptation themselves in this direction, they were eagerly anxious to\r\nprevent other people getting such appointments as a reward for political\r\nservices. In this they were quite right. It would be impossible to run\r\nany big public office to advantage save along the lines of the strictest\r\napplication of Civil Service Reform principles; and the system should be\r\nextended throughout our governmental service far more widely than is now\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nBut there are other and more vital reforms than this. Too many Civil\r\nService Reformers, when the trial came, proved tepidly indifferent\r\nor actively hostile to reforms that were of profound and far-reaching\r\nsocial and industrial consequence. Many of them were at best lukewarm\r\nabout movements for the improvement of the conditions of toil and\r\nlife among men and women who labor under hard surroundings, and were\r\npositively hostile to movements which curbed the power of the great\r\ncorporation magnates and directed into useful instead of pernicious\r\nchannels the activities of the great corporation lawyers who advised\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMost of the newspapers which regarded themselves as the especial\r\nchampions of Civil Service Reform and as the highest exponents of civic\r\nvirtue, and which distrusted the average citizen and shuddered over the\r\n\"coarseness\" of the professional politicians, were, nevertheless, given\r\nto vices even more contemptible than, although not so gross as, those\r\nthey denounced and derided. Their editors were refined men of cultivated\r\ntastes, whose pet temptations were backbiting, mean slander, and\r\nthe snobbish worship of anything clothed in wealth and the outward\r\nappearances of conventional respectability. They were not robust or\r\npowerful men; they felt ill at ease in the company of rough, strong\r\nmen; often they had in them a vein of physical timidity. They avenged\r\nthemselves to themselves for an uneasy subconsciousness of their\r\nown shortcomings by sitting in cloistered--or, rather, pleasantly\r\nupholstered--seclusion, and sneering at and lying about men who made\r\nthem feel uncomfortable. Sometimes these were bad men, who made them\r\nfeel uncomfortable by the exhibition of coarse and repellent vice; and\r\nsometimes they were men of high character, who held ideals of courage\r\nand of service to others, and who looked down and warred against the\r\nshortcomings of swollen wealth, and the effortless, easy lives of those\r\nwhose horizon is bounded by a sheltered and timid respectability.\r\nThese newspapers, owned and edited by these men, although free from the\r\nrepulsive vulgarity of the yellow press, were susceptible to influence\r\nby the privileged interests, and were almost or quite as hostile to\r\nmanliness as they were to unrefined vice--and were much more hostile\r\nto it than to the typical shortcomings of wealth and refinement. They\r\nfavored Civil Service Reform; they favored copyright laws, and the\r\nremoval of the tariff on works of art; they favored all the proper (and\r\neven more strongly all the improper) movements for international peace\r\nand arbitration; in short, they favored all good, and many goody-goody,\r\nmeasures so long as they did not cut deep into social wrong or make\r\ndemands on National and individual virility. They opposed, or were\r\nlukewarm about, efforts to build up the army and the navy, for they were\r\nnot sensitive concerning National honor; and, above all, they opposed\r\nevery non-milk-and-water effort, however sane, to change our social and\r\neconomic system in such a fashion as to substitute the ideal of justice\r\ntowards all for the ideal of kindly charity from the favored few to the\r\npossibly grateful many.\r\n\r\nSome of the men foremost in the struggle for Civil Service Reform have\r\ntaken a position of honorable leadership in the battle for those other\r\nand more vital reforms. But many of them promptly abandoned the field of\r\neffort for decency when the battle took the form, not of a fight against\r\nthe petty grafting of small bosses and small politicians--a vitally\r\nnecessary battle, be it remembered--but of a fight against the great\r\nintrenched powers of privilege, a fight to secure justice through the\r\nlaw for ordinary men and women, instead of leaving them to suffer cruel\r\ninjustice either because the law failed to protect them or because it\r\nwas twisted from its legitimate purposes into a means for oppressing\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons why the boss so often keeps his hold, especially in\r\nmunicipal matters, is, or at least has been in the past, because so\r\nmany of the men who claim to be reformers have been blind to the need\r\nof working in human fashion for social and industrial betterment. Such\r\nwords as \"boss\" and \"machine\" now imply evil, but both the implication\r\nthe words carry and the definition of the words themselves are somewhat\r\nvague. A leader is necessary; but his opponents always call him a boss.\r\nAn organization is necessary; but the men in opposition always call it a\r\nmachine. Nevertheless, there is a real and deep distinction between the\r\nleader and the boss, between organizations and machines. A political\r\nleader who fights openly for principles, and who keeps his position of\r\nleadership by stirring the consciences and convincing the intellects of\r\nhis followers, so that they have confidence in him and will follow him\r\nbecause they can achieve greater results under him than under any one\r\nelse, is doing work which is indispensable in a democracy. The boss, on\r\nthe other hand, is a man who does not gain his power by open means, but\r\nby secret means, and usually by corrupt means. Some of the worst and\r\nmost powerful bosses in our political history either held no public\r\noffice or else some unimportant public office. They made no appeal\r\neither to intellect or conscience. Their work was done behind closed\r\ndoors, and consisted chiefly in the use of that greed which gives in\r\norder that in return it may get. A boss of this kind can pull wires in\r\nconventions, can manipulate members of the Legislature, can control\r\nthe giving or withholding of office, and serves as the intermediary for\r\nbringing together the powers of corrupt politics and corrupt business.\r\nIf he is at one end of the social scale, he may through his agents\r\ntraffic in the most brutal forms of vice and give protection to the\r\npurveyors of shame and sin in return for money bribes. If at the other\r\nend of the scale, he may be the means of securing favors from high\r\npublic officials, legislative or executive, to great industrial\r\ninterests; the transaction being sometimes a naked matter of bargain and\r\nsale, and sometimes being carried on in such manner that both parties\r\nthereto can more or less successfully disguise it to their consciences\r\nas in the public interest. The machine is simply another name for the\r\nkind of organization which is certain to grow up in a party or section\r\nof a party controlled by such bosses as these and by their henchmen,\r\nwhereas, of course, an effective organization of decent men is essential\r\nin order to secure decent politics.\r\n\r\nIf these bosses were responsible for nothing but pure wickedness, they\r\nwould probably last but a short time in any community. And, in any\r\nevent, if the men who are horrified by their wickedness were themselves\r\nas practical and as thoroughly in touch with human nature, the bosses\r\nwould have a short shrift. The trouble is that the boss does understand\r\nhuman nature, and that he fills a place which the reformer cannot fill\r\nunless he likewise understands human nature. Sometimes the boss is a man\r\nwho cares for political power purely for its own sake, as he might care\r\nfor any other hobby; more often he has in view some definitely selfish\r\nobject such as political or financial advancement. He can rarely\r\naccomplish much unless he has another side to him. A successful boss is\r\nvery apt to be a man who, in addition to committing wickedness in his\r\nown interest, also does look after the interests of others, even if not\r\nfrom good motives. There are some communities so fortunate that there\r\nare very few men who have private interests to be served, and in\r\nthese the power of the boss is at a minimum. There are many country\r\ncommunities of this type. But in communities where there is poverty and\r\nignorance, the conditions are ripe for the growth of a boss. Moreover,\r\nwherever big business interests are liable either to be improperly\r\nfavored or improperly discriminated against and blackmailed by public\r\nofficials--and the result is just as vicious in one case as in the\r\nother--the boss is almost certain to develop. The best way of getting at\r\nthis type of boss is by keeping the public conscience aroused and alert,\r\nso that it will tolerate neither improper attack upon, nor improper\r\nfavoritism towards, these corporations, and will quickly punish any\r\npublic servant guilty of either.\r\n\r\nThere is often much good in the type of boss, especially common in big\r\ncities, who fulfills towards the people of his district in rough\r\nand ready fashion the position of friend and protector. He uses his\r\ninfluence to get jobs for young men who need them. He goes into court\r\nfor a wild young fellow who has gotten into trouble. He helps out with\r\ncash or credit the widow who is in straits, or the breadwinner who is\r\ncrippled or for some other cause temporarily out of work. He organizes\r\nclambakes and chowder parties and picnics, and is consulted by the\r\nlocal labor leaders when a cut in wages is threatened. For some of\r\nhis constituents he does proper favors, and for others wholly improper\r\nfavors; but he preserves human relations with all. He may be a very bad\r\nand very corrupt man, a man whose action in blackmailing and protecting\r\nvice is of far-reaching damage to his constituents. But these\r\nconstituents are for the most part men and women who struggle hard\r\nagainst poverty and with whom the problem of living is very real and\r\nvery close. They would prefer clean and honest government, if this\r\nclean and honest government is accompanied by human sympathy, human\r\nunderstanding. But an appeal made to them for virtue in the abstract, an\r\nappeal made by good men who do not really understand their needs, will\r\noften pass quite unheeded, if on the other side stands the boss, the\r\nfriend and benefactor, who may have been guilty of much wrong-doing in\r\nthings that they are hardly aware concern them, but who appeals to them,\r\nnot only for the sake of favors to come, but in the name of gratitude\r\nand loyalty, and above all of understanding and fellow-feeling. They\r\nhave a feeling of clan-loyalty to him; his and their relations may be\r\nsubstantially those which are right and proper among primitive people\r\nstill in the clan stage of moral development. The successful fight\r\nagainst this type of vicious boss, and the type of vicious politics\r\nwhich produces it, can be made only by men who have a genuine\r\nfellow-feeling for and understanding of the people for and with whom\r\nthey are to work, and who in practical fashion seek their social and\r\nindustrial benefit.\r\n\r\nThere are communities of poor men, whose lives are hard, in which the\r\nboss, though he would be out of place in a more advanced community, if\r\nfundamentally an honest man, meets a real need which would otherwise not\r\nbe met. Because of his limitations in other than purely local matters\r\nit may be our duty to fight such a boss; but it may also be our duty\r\nto recognize, within his limitations, both his sincerity and his\r\nusefulness.\r\n\r\nYet again even the boss who really is evil, like the business man who\r\nreally is evil, may on certain points be sound, and be doing good work.\r\nIt may be the highest duty of the patriotic public servant to work with\r\nthe big boss or the big business man on these points, while refusing\r\nto work with him on others. In the same way there are many self-styled\r\nreformers whose conduct is such as to warrant Tom Reed's bitter remark,\r\nthat when Dr. Johnson defined patriotism as the last refuge of a\r\nscoundrel he was ignorant of the infinite possibilities contained in the\r\nword reform. Yet, none the less, it is our duty to work for the\r\nreforms these men champion, without regard to the misconduct of the men\r\nthemselves on other points. I have known in my life many big business\r\nmen and many big political bosses who often or even generally did evil,\r\nbut who on some occasions and on certain issues were right. I never\r\nhesitated to do battle against these men when they were wrong; and, on\r\nthe other hand, as long as they were going my way I was glad to have\r\nthem do so. To have repudiated their aid when they were right and were\r\nstriving for a right end, and for what was of benefit to the people--no\r\nmatter what their motives may have been--would have been childish, and\r\nmoreover would have itself been misconduct against the people.\r\n\r\nMy duty was to stand with every one while he was right, and to stand\r\nagainst him when he went wrong; and this I have tried to do as regards\r\nindividuals and as regards groups of individuals. When a business man or\r\nlabor leader, politician or reformer, is right, I support him; when\r\nhe goes wrong, I leave him. When Mr. Lorimer upheld the war for the\r\nliberation of Cuba, I supported him; when he became United States\r\nSenator by improper methods, I opposed him. The principles or methods\r\nwhich the Socialists advocate and which I believe to be in the interest\r\nof the people I support, and those which I believe to be against the\r\ninterest of the people I oppose. Moreover, when a man has done evil, but\r\nchanges, and works for decency and righteousness, and when, as far as\r\nI can see, the change is real and the man's conduct sincere, then I\r\nwelcome him and work heartily with him, as an equal with an equal.\r\nFor thirty years after the Civil War the creed of mere materialism was\r\nrampant in both American politics and American business, and many, many\r\nstrong men, in accordance with the prevailing commercial and political\r\nmorality, did things for which they deserve blame and condemnation; but\r\nif they now sincerely change, and strive for better things, it is unwise\r\nand unjust to bar them from fellowship. So long as they work for evil,\r\nsmite them with the sword of the Lord and of Gideon! When they change\r\nand show their faith by their works, remember the words of Ezekiel: \"If\r\nthe wicked will turn from all the sins he has committed, and keep all my\r\nstatutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live,\r\nhe shall not die. All his transgressions that he hath committed, they\r\nshall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done\r\nhe shall live. Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die?\r\nsaith the Lord God; and not that he should return from his ways and\r\nlive?\"\r\n\r\nEvery man who has been in practical politics grows to realize that\r\npoliticians, big and little, are no more all of them bad than they are\r\nall of them good. Many of these men are very bad men indeed, but there\r\nare others among them--and some among those held up to special obloquy,\r\ntoo--who, even although they may have done much that is evil, also show\r\ntraits of sterling worth which many of their critics wholly lack. There\r\nare few men for whom I have ever felt a more cordial and contemptuous\r\ndislike than for some of the bosses and big professional politicians\r\nwith whom I have been brought into contact. On the other hand, in\r\nthe case of some political leaders who were most bitterly attacked as\r\nbosses, I grew to know certain sides of their characters which inspired\r\nin me a very genuine regard and respect.\r\n\r\nTo read much of the assault on Senator Hanna, one would have thought\r\nthat he was a man incapable of patriotism or of far-sighted devotion to\r\nthe country's good. I was brought into intimate contact with him only\r\nduring the two and a half years immediately preceding his death. I was\r\nthen President, and perforce watched all his actions at close range.\r\nDuring that time he showed himself to be a man of rugged sincerity of\r\npurpose, of great courage and loyalty, and of unswerving devotion to the\r\ninterests of the Nation and the people as he saw those interests. He was\r\nas sincerely desirous of helping laboring men as of helping capitalists.\r\nHis ideals were in many ways not my ideals, and there were points where\r\nboth by temperament and by conviction we were far apart. Before this\r\ntime he had always been unfriendly to me; and I do not think he ever\r\ngrew to like me, at any rate not until the very end of his life.\r\nMoreover, I came to the Presidency under circumstances which, if he\r\nhad been a smaller man, would inevitably have thrown him into violent\r\nantagonism to me. He was the close and intimate friend of President\r\nMcKinley. He was McKinley's devoted ally and follower, and his trusted\r\nadviser, who was in complete sympathy with him. Partly because of this\r\nfriendship, his position in the Senate and in the country was unique.\r\n\r\nWith McKinley's sudden death Senator Hanna found himself bereft of his\r\ndearest friend, while I, who had just come to the Presidency, was in his\r\nview an untried man, whose trustworthiness on many public questions\r\nwas at least doubtful. Ordinarily, as has been shown, not only in\r\nour history, but in the history of all other countries, in countless\r\ninstances, over and over again, this situation would have meant\r\nsuspicion, ill will, and, at the last, open and violent antagonism. Such\r\nwas not the result, in this case, primarily because Senator Hanna had in\r\nhim the quality that enabled him to meet a serious crisis with dignity,\r\nwith power, and with disinterested desire to work for the common good.\r\nWithin a few days of my accession he called on me, and with entire\r\nfriendliness and obvious sincerity, but also with entire self-respect,\r\nexplained that he mourned McKinley as probably no other man did; that he\r\nhad not been especially my friend, but that he wished me to understand\r\nthat thenceforward, on every question where he could conscientiously\r\nsupport me, I could count upon his giving me as loyal aid as it was\r\nin his power to render. He added that this must not be understood as\r\ncommitting him to favor me for nomination and election, because that\r\nmatter must be left to take care of itself as events should decide; but\r\nthat, aside from this, what he said was to be taken literally; in other\r\nwords, he would do his best to make my Administration a success by\r\nsupporting me heartily on every point on which he conscientiously could,\r\nand that this I could count upon. He kept his word absolutely. He never\r\nbecame especially favorable to my nomination; and most of his close\r\nfriends became bitterly opposed to me and used every effort to persuade\r\nhim to try to bring about my downfall. Most men in his position would\r\nhave been tempted to try to make capital at my expense by antagonizing\r\nme and discrediting me so as to make my policies fail, just for the\r\nsake of making them fail. Senator Hanna, on the contrary, did everything\r\npossible to make them succeed. He kept his word in the letter and the\r\nspirit, and on every point on which he felt conscientiously able to\r\nsupport me he gave me the heartiest and most effective support, and did\r\nall in his power to make my Administration a success; and this with\r\nno hope of any reward for himself, of any gratitude from me, or of any\r\nappreciation by the public at large, but solely because he deemed such\r\naction necessary for the well-being of the country as a whole.\r\n\r\nMy experience with Senator Quay was similar. I had no personal relations\r\nwith him before I was President, and knew nothing of him save by\r\nhearsay. Soon after I became President, Senator Quay called upon me,\r\ntold me he had known me very slightly, that he thought most men who\r\nclaimed to be reformers were hypocrites, but that he deemed me sincere,\r\nthat he thought conditions had become such that aggressive courage\r\nand honesty were necessary in order to remedy them, that he believed I\r\nintended to be a good and efficient President, and that to the best\r\nof his ability he would support me in it making my Administration a\r\nsuccess. He kept his word with absolute good faith. He had been in the\r\nCivil War, and was a medal of honor man; and I think my having been in\r\nthe Spanish War gave him at the outset a kindly feeling toward me.\r\nHe was also a very well-read man--I owe to him, for instance, my\r\nacquaintance with the writings of the Finnish novelist Topelius. Not\r\nonly did he support me on almost every public question in which I was\r\nmost interested--including, I am convinced, every one on which he felt\r\nhe conscientiously could do so--but he also at the time of his death\r\ngave a striking proof of his disinterested desire to render a service to\r\ncertain poor people, and this under conditions in which not only would\r\nhe never know if the service were rendered but in which he had no reason\r\nto expect that his part in it would ever be made known to any other man.\r\n\r\nQuay was descended from a French voyageur who had some Indian blood in\r\nhim. He was proud of this Indian blood, took an especial interest in\r\nIndians, and whenever Indians came to Washington they always called on\r\nhim. Once during my Administration a delegation of Iroquois came over\r\nfrom Canada to call on me at the White House. Their visit had in it\r\nsomething that was pathetic as well as amusing. They represented the\r\ndescendants of the Six Nations, who fled to Canada after Sullivan\r\nharried their towns in the Revolutionary War. Now, a century and a\r\nquarter later, their people thought that they would like to come back\r\ninto the United States; and these representatives had called upon me\r\nwith the dim hope that perhaps I could give their tribes land on which\r\nthey could settle. As soon as they reached Washington they asked Quay to\r\nbring them to call on me, which he did, telling me that of course their\r\nerrand was hopeless and that he had explained as much to them, but that\r\nthey would like me to extend the courtesy of an interview. At the close\r\nof the interview, which had been conducted with all the solemnities of\r\ncalumet and wampum, the Indians filed out. Quay, before following them,\r\nturned to me with his usual emotionless face and said, \"Good-by, Mr.\r\nPresident; this reminds one of the Flight of a Tartar Tribe, doesn't\r\nit?\" I answered, \"So you're fond of De Quincey, Senator?\" to which Quay\r\nresponded, \"Yes; always liked De Quincey; good-by.\" And away he went\r\nwith the tribesmen, who seemed to have walked out of a remote past.\r\n\r\nQuay had become particularly concerned about the Delawares in the Indian\r\nTerritory. He felt that the Interior Department did not do them justice.\r\nHe also felt that his colleagues of the Senate took no interest in them.\r\nWhen in the spring of 1904 he lay in his house mortally sick, he sent\r\nme word that he had something important to say to me, and would have\r\nhimself carried round to see me. I sent back word not to think of doing\r\nso, and that on my way back from church next Sunday I would stop in\r\nand call on him. This I accordingly did. He was lying in his bed, death\r\nwritten on his face. He thanked me for coming, and then explained\r\nthat, as he was on the point of death and knew he would never return to\r\nWashington--it was late spring and he was about to leave--he wished to\r\nsee me to get my personal promise that, after he died, I would myself\r\nlook after the interests of the Delaware Indians. He added that he did\r\nnot trust the Interior Department--although he knew that I did not share\r\nhis views on this point--and that still less did he believe that any of\r\nhis colleagues in the Senate would exert themselves in the interests of\r\nthe Delawares, and that therefore he wished my personal assurance that I\r\nwould personally see that no injustice was done them. I told him I would\r\ndo so, and then added, in rather perfunctory fashion, that he must not\r\ntake such a gloomy view of himself, that when he got away for the summer\r\nI hoped he would recover and be back all right when Congress opened. A\r\ngleam came into the old fighter's eyes and he answered: \"No, I am dying,\r\nand you know it. I don't mind dying; but I do wish it were possible for\r\nme to get off into the great north woods and crawl out on a rock in the\r\nsun and die like a wolf!\"\r\n\r\nI never saw him again. When he died I sent a telegram of sympathy to his\r\nwife. A paper which constantly preached reform, and which kept up its\r\ncirculation by the no less constant practice of slander, a paper which\r\nin theory condemned all public men who violated the eighth commandment,\r\nand in practice subsisted by incessant violation of the ninth, assailed\r\nme for sending my message to the dead man's wife. I knew the editors of\r\nthis paper, and the editor who was their predecessor. They had led\r\nlives of bodily ease and the avoidance of bodily risk; they earned their\r\nlivelihood by the practice of mendacity for profit; and they delivered\r\nmalignant judgment on a dead man who, whatever his faults, had in his\r\nyouth freely risked his life for a great ideal, and who when death was\r\nalready clutching his breast had spent almost his last breath on behalf\r\nof humble and friendless people whom he had served with disinterested\r\nloyalty.\r\n\r\nThere is no greater duty than to war on the corrupt and unprincipled\r\nboss, and on the corrupt and unprincipled business man; and for the\r\nmatter of that, on the corrupt and unprincipled labor leader also,\r\nand on the corrupt and unprincipled editor, and on any one else who is\r\ncorrupt and unprincipled. But where the conditions are such, whether in\r\npolitics or in business, that the great majority of men have behaved in\r\na way which is gradually seen to be improper, but which at one time did\r\nnot conflict with the generally accepted morality, then the warfare on\r\nthe system should not include warfare on the men themselves, unless\r\nthey decline to amend their ways and to dissociate themselves from the\r\nsystem. There are many good, unimaginative citizens who in politics\r\nor in business act in accordance with accepted standards, in a\r\nmatter-of-course way, without questioning these standards; until\r\nsomething happens which sharply arouses them to the situation, whereupon\r\nthey try to work for better things. The proper course in such event is\r\nto let bygones be bygones, and if the men prove by their actions the\r\nsincerity of their conversion, heartily to work with them for the\r\nbetterment of business and political conditions.\r\n\r\nBy the time that I was ending my career as Civil Service Commissioner\r\nI was already growing to understand that mere improvement in political\r\nconditions by itself was not enough. I dimly realized that an even\r\ngreater fight must be waged to improve economic conditions, and to\r\nsecure social and industrial justice, justice as between individuals\r\nand justice as between classes. I began to see that political effort was\r\nlargely valuable as it found expression and resulted in such social and\r\nindustrial betterment. I was gradually puzzling out, or trying to puzzle\r\nout, the answers to various questions--some as yet unsolvable to any of\r\nus, but for the solution of which it is the bounden duty of all of us to\r\nwork. I had grown to realize very keenly that the duty of the Government\r\nto protect women and children must be extended to include the protection\r\nof all the crushable elements of labor. I saw that it was the affair of\r\nall our people to see that justice obtained between the big corporation\r\nand its employees, and between the big corporation and its smaller\r\nrivals, as well as its customers and the general public. I saw that it\r\nwas the affair of all of us, and not only of the employer, if dividends\r\nwent up and wages went down; that it was to the interest of all of us\r\nthat a full share of the benefit of improved machinery should go to the\r\nworkman who used the machinery; and also that it was to the interest of\r\nall of us that each man, whether brain worker or hand worker, should\r\ndo the best work of which he was capable, and that there should be\r\nsome correspondence between the value of the work and the value of the\r\nreward. It is these and many similar questions which in their sum\r\nmake up the great social and industrial problems of to-day, the most\r\ninteresting and important of the problems with which our public life\r\nmust deal.\r\n\r\nIn handling these problems I believe that much can be done by the\r\nGovernment. Furthermore, I believe that, after all that the Government\r\ncan do has been done, there will remain as the most vital of all factors\r\nthe individual character of the average man and the average woman.\r\nNo governmental action can do more than supplement individual action.\r\nMoreover, there must be collective action of kinds distinct from\r\ngovernmental action. A body of public opinion must be formed, must\r\nmake itself felt, and in the end transform, and be transformed by, the\r\ngradual raising of individual standards of conduct.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to see how difficult it is to make some men understand\r\nthat insistence upon one factor does not and must not mean failure fully\r\nto recognize other factors. The selfish individual needs to be taught\r\nthat we must now shackle cunning by law exactly as a few centuries back\r\nwe shackled force by law. Unrestricted individualism spells ruin to\r\nthe individual himself. But so does the elimination of individualism,\r\nwhether by law or custom. It is a capital error to fail to recognize the\r\nvital need of good laws. It is also a capital error to believe that good\r\nlaws will accomplish anything unless the average man has the right stuff\r\nin him. The toiler, the manual laborer, has received less than justice,\r\nand he must be protected, both by law, by custom, and by the exercise\r\nof his right to increase his wage; and yet to decrease the quantity and\r\nquality of his work will work only evil. There must be a far greater\r\nmeed of respect and reward for the hand worker than we now give him, if\r\nour society is to be put on a sound basis; and this respect and reward\r\ncannot be given him unless he is as ambitious to do the best possible\r\nwork as is the highest type of brain worker, whether doctor or writer or\r\nartist. There must be a raising of standards, and not a leveling down to\r\nthe standard of the poorest and most inefficient. There is urgent need\r\nof intelligent governmental action to assist in making the life of the\r\nman who tills the soil all that it should be, and to see that the manual\r\nworker gets his full share of the reward for what he helps produce; but\r\nif either farmer, mechanic, or day laborer is shiftless or lazy, if he\r\nshirks downright hard work, if he is stupid or self-indulgent, then no\r\nlaw can save him, and he must give way to a better type.\r\n\r\nI suppose that some good people will misunderstand what I say, and\r\nwill insist on taking only half of it as representing the whole. Let\r\nme repeat. When I say, that, even after we have all the good laws\r\nnecessary, the chief factor in any given man's success or failure must\r\nbe that man's own character, it must not be inferred that I am in the\r\nleast minimizing the importance of these laws, the real and vital need\r\nfor them. The struggle for individual advancement and development can be\r\nbrought to naught, or indefinitely retarded, by the absence of law or by\r\nbad law. It can be immeasurably aided by organized effort on the part\r\nof the State. Collective action and individual action, public law and\r\nprivate character, are both necessary. It is only by a slow and patient\r\ninward transformation such as these laws aid in bringing about that men\r\nare really helped upward in their struggle for a higher and a fuller\r\nlife. Recognition of individual character as the most important of all\r\nfactors does not mean failure fully to recognize that we must have good\r\nlaws, and that we must have our best men in office to enforce these\r\nlaws. The Nation collectively will in this way be able to be of real and\r\ngenuine service to each of us individually; and, on the other hand,\r\nthe wisdom of the collective action will mainly depend on the high\r\nindividual average of citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe relationship of man and woman is the fundamental relationship that\r\nstands at the base of the whole social structure. Much can be done by\r\nlaw towards putting women on a footing of complete and entire equal\r\nrights with man--including the right to vote, the right to hold and use\r\nproperty, and the right to enter any profession she desires on the same\r\nterms as a man. Yet when this has been done it will amount to little\r\nunless on the one hand the man himself realizes his duty to the woman,\r\nand unless on the other hand the woman realizes that she has no claim to\r\nrights unless she performs the duties that go with those rights and that\r\nalone justify her in appealing to them. A cruel, selfish, or licentious\r\nman is an abhorrent member of the community; but, after all, his actions\r\nare no worse in the long run than those of the woman who is content to\r\nbe a parasite on others, who is cold, selfish, caring for nothing but\r\nfrivolous pleasure and ignoble ease. The law of worthy effort, the\r\nlaw of service for a worthy end, without regard to whether it brings\r\npleasure or pain, is the only right law of life, whether for man or for\r\nwoman. The man must not be selfish; nor, if the woman is wise, will she\r\nlet the man grow selfish, and this not only for her own sake but for\r\nhis. One of the prime needs is to remember that almost every duty is\r\ncomposed of two seemingly conflicting elements, and that over-insistence\r\non one, to the exclusion of the other, may defeat its own end. Any man\r\nwho studies the statistics of the birth-rate among the native Americans\r\nof New England, or among the native French of France, needs not to be\r\ntold that when prudence and forethought are carried to the point of cold\r\nselfishness and self-indulgence, the race is bound to disappear. Taking\r\ninto account the women who for good reasons do not marry, or who when\r\nmarried are childless or are able to have but one or two children, it is\r\nevident that the married woman able to have children must on an average\r\nhave four or the race will not perpetuate itself. This is the mere\r\nstatement of a self-evident truth. Yet foolish and self-indulgent\r\npeople often resent this statement as if it were in some way possible\r\nby denunciation to reverse the facts of nature; and, on the other hand,\r\nimprovident and shiftless people, inconsiderate and brutal people, treat\r\nthe statement as if it justified heads of families in having enormous\r\nnumbers of badly nourished, badly brought up, and badly cared for\r\nchildren for whom they make no effort to provide. A man must think\r\nwell before he marries. He must be a tender and considerate husband and\r\nrealize that there is no other human being to whom he owes so much of\r\nlove and regard and consideration as he does to the woman who with pain\r\nbears and with labor rears the children that are his. No words can paint\r\nthe scorn and contempt which must be felt by all right-thinking men, not\r\nonly for the brutal husband, but for the husband who fails to show full\r\nloyalty and consideration to his wife. Moreover, he must work, he must\r\ndo his part in the world. On the other hand, the woman must realize that\r\nshe has no more right to shirk the business of wifehood and motherhood\r\nthan the man has to shirk his business as breadwinner for the household.\r\nWomen should have free access to every field of labor which they care to\r\nenter, and when their work is as valuable as that of a man it should be\r\npaid as highly. Yet normally for the man and the woman whose welfare\r\nis more important than the welfare of any other human beings, the woman\r\nmust remain the housemother, the homekeeper, and the man must remain the\r\nbreadwinner, the provider for the wife who bears his children and for\r\nthe children she brings into the world. No other work is as valuable or\r\nas exacting for either man or woman; it must always, in every healthy\r\nsociety, be for both man and woman the prime work, the most important\r\nwork; normally all other work is of secondary importance, and must\r\ncome as an addition to, not a substitute for, this primary work. The\r\npartnership should be one of equal rights, one of love, of self-respect,\r\nand unselfishness, above all a partnership for the performance of the\r\nmost vitally important of all duties. The performance of duty, and not\r\nan indulgence in vapid ease and vapid pleasure, is all that makes life\r\nworth while.\r\n\r\nSuffrage for women should be looked on from this standpoint. Personally\r\nI feel that it is exactly as much a \"right\" of women as of men to vote.\r\nBut the important point with both men and women is to treat the\r\nexercise of the suffrage as a duty, which, in the long run, must be\r\nwell performed to be of the slightest value. I always favored woman's\r\nsuffrage, but only tepidly, until my association with women like Jane\r\nAddams and Frances Kellor, who desired it as one means of enabling them\r\nto render better and more efficient service, changed me into a zealous\r\ninstead of a lukewarm adherent of the cause--in spite of the fact that\r\na few of the best women of the same type, women like Mary Antin, did not\r\nfavor the movement. A vote is like a rifle: its usefulness depends upon\r\nthe character of the user. The mere possession of the vote will no more\r\nbenefit men and women not sufficiently developed to use it than the\r\npossession of rifles will turn untrained Egyptian fellaheen into\r\nsoldiers. This is as true of woman as of man--and no more true.\r\nUniversal suffrage in Hayti has not made the Haytians able to govern\r\nthemselves in any true sense; and woman suffrage in Utah in no shape or\r\nway affected the problem of polygamy. I believe in suffrage for women\r\nin America, because I think they are fit for it. I believe for women,\r\nas for men, more in the duty of fitting one's self to do well and wisely\r\nwith the ballot than in the naked right to cast the ballot.\r\n\r\nI wish that people would read books like the novels and stories, at once\r\nstrong and charming, of Henry Bordeaux, books like Kathleen Norris's\r\n\"Mother,\" and Cornelia Comer's \"Preliminaries,\" and would use these,\r\nand other such books, as tracts, now and then! Perhaps the following\r\ncorrespondence will give a better idea than I can otherwise give of the\r\nproblems that in everyday life come before men and women, and of the\r\nneed that the man shall show himself unselfish and considerate, and do\r\nhis full share of the joint duty:\r\n\r\nJanuary 3, 1913.\r\n\r\n_Colonel Theodore Roosevelt_:\r\n\r\nDear Sir--I suppose you are willing to stand sponsor for the assertion\r\nthat the women of the country are not doing their duty unless they have\r\nlarge families. I wonder if you know the real reason, after all. Society\r\nand clubs are held largely to blame, but society really takes in so few\r\npeople, after all. I thought, when I got married at twenty, that it was\r\nthe proper thing to have a family, and, as we had very little of this\r\nworld's goods, also thought it the thing to do all the necessary work\r\nfor them. I have had nine children, did all my own work, including\r\nwashing, ironing, house-cleaning, and the care of the little ones as\r\nthey came along, which was about every two years; also sewed everything\r\nthey wore, including trousers for the boys and caps and jackets for the\r\ngirls while little. I also helped them all in their school work, and\r\nstarted them in music, etc. But as they grew older I got behind the\r\ntimes. I never belonged to a club or a society or lodge, nor went to any\r\none's house scarcely; there wasn't time. In consequence, I knew nothing\r\nthat was going on in the town, much less the events of the country, and\r\nat the same time my husband kept growing in wisdom and knowledge,\r\nfrom mixing with men and hearing topics of the times discussed. At the\r\nbeginning of our married life I had just as quick a mind to grasp things\r\nas he did, and had more school education, having graduated from a three\r\nyears' high school. My husband more and more declined to discuss things\r\nwith me; as he said, \"I didn't know anything about it.\" When I'd ask\r\nhe'd say, \"Oh, you wouldn't understand if I'd tell you.\" So here I am,\r\nat forty-five years, hopelessly dull and uninteresting, while he can\r\nmix with the brightest minds in the country as an equal. He's a strong\r\nProgressive man, took very active part in the late campaign, etc. I\r\nam also Progressive, and tried my best, after so many years of shut-in\r\nlife, to grasp the ideas you stood for, and read everything I could find\r\nduring the summer and fall. But I've been out of touch with people too\r\nlong now, and my husband would much rather go and talk to some woman who\r\nhasn't had any children, because she knows things (I am not specifying\r\nany particular woman). I simply bore him to death because I'm not\r\ninteresting. Now, tell me, how was it my fault? I was only doing what\r\nI thought was my duty. No woman can keep up with things who never talks\r\nwith any one but young children. As soon as my children grew up they\r\ntook the same attitude as their father, and frequently say, \"Oh, mother\r\ndoesn't know.\" They look up to and admire their father because he's a\r\nman of the world and knows how to act when he goes out. How can I urge\r\nmy daughters now to go and raise large families? It means by the time\r\nyou have lost your figure and charm for them they are all ashamed of\r\nyou. Now, as a believer in woman's rights, do a little talking to the\r\nmen as to their duties to their wives, or else refrain from urging\r\nus women to have children. I am only one of thousands of middle-class\r\nrespectable women who give their lives to raise a nice family, and then\r\nwho become bitter from the injustice done us. Don't let this go into the\r\nwaste-basket, but think it over.\r\n\r\nYours respectfully,\r\n\r\n---- ----.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew York, January 11, 1913.\r\n\r\n_My Dear Mrs. ----_:\r\n\r\nMost certainly your letter will not go into the waste-paper basket. I\r\nshall think it over and show it to Mrs. Roosevelt. Will you let me\r\nsay, in the first place, that a woman who can write such a letter is\r\ncertainly not \"hopelessly dull and uninteresting\"! If the facts are as\r\nyou state, then I do not wonder that you feel bitterly and that you\r\nfeel that the gravest kind of injustice has been done you. I have always\r\ntried to insist to men that they should do their duty to the women even\r\nmore than the women to them. Now I hardly like to write specifically\r\nabout your husband, because you might not like it yourself. It seems to\r\nme almost incredible that any man who is the husband of a woman who has\r\nborne him nine children should not feel that they and he are lastingly\r\nher debtors. You say that you have had nine children, that you did all\r\nyour own work, including washing, ironing, house-cleaning, and the care\r\nof the little ones as they came along; that you sewed everything they\r\nwore, including trousers for the boys and caps and jackets for the girls\r\nwhile little; that you helped them all in their school work and started\r\nthem in music; but that as they grew older you got behind the times,\r\nthat you never belonged to a club or society or lodge, nor went to any\r\none's house, as you hardly had time to do so; and that in consequence\r\nyour husband outgrew you, and that your children look up to him and not\r\nto you and feel that they have outgrown you. If these facts are so, you\r\nhave done a great and wonderful work, and the only explanation I can\r\npossibly give of the attitude you describe on the part of your husband\r\nand children is that they do not understand what it is that you have\r\ndone. I emphatically believe in unselfishness, but I also believe that\r\nit is a mistake to let other people grow selfish, even when the other\r\npeople are husband and children.\r\n\r\nNow, I suggest that you take your letter to me, of which I send you back\r\na copy, and this letter, and then select out of your family the one with\r\nwhom you feel most sympathy, whether it is your husband or one of your\r\nchildren. Show the two letters to him or her, and then have a frank talk\r\nabout the matter. If any man, as you say, becomes ashamed of his wife\r\nbecause she has lost her figure in bearing his children, then that man\r\nis a hound and has every cause to be ashamed of himself. I am sending\r\nyou a little book called \"Mother,\" by Kathleen Norris, which will give\r\nyou my views on the matter. Of course there are base and selfish men,\r\njust as there are, although I believe in smaller number, base and\r\nselfish women. Man and woman alike should profit by the teachings in\r\nsuch a story as this of \"Mother.\"\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 21, 1913.\r\n\r\n_Colonel Theodore Roosevelt_:\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir--Your letter came as a surprise, for I wasn't expecting\r\nan answer. The next day the book came, and I thank you for your ready\r\nsympathy and understanding. I feel as though you and Mrs. Roosevelt\r\nwould think I was hardly loyal to my husband and children; but knowing\r\nof no other way to bring the idea which was so strong in my mind to your\r\nnotice, I told my personal story. If it will, in a small measure, be the\r\nmeans of helping some one else by molding public opinion, through you, I\r\nshall be content. You have helped me more than you know. Just having you\r\ninterested is as good as a tonic, and braces me up till I feel as though\r\nI shall refuse to be \"laid on the shelf.\" . . . To think that you'd\r\nbother to send me a book. I shall always treasure it both for the text\r\nof the book and the sender. I read it with absorbing interest. The\r\nmother was so splendid. She was ideal. The situations are so startlingly\r\nreal, just like what happens here every day with variations.\r\n\r\n---- ----.\r\n\r\nA narrative of facts is often more convincing than a homily; and these\r\ntwo letters of my correspondent carry their own lesson.\r\n\r\nParenthetically, let me remark that whenever a man thinks that he\r\nhas outgrown the woman who is his mate, he will do well carefully to\r\nconsider whether his growth has not been downward instead of upward,\r\nwhether the facts are not merely that he has fallen away from his wife's\r\nstandard of refinement and of duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE NEW YORK POLICE\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1895 I was appointed by Mayor Strong Police\r\nCommissioner, and I served as President of the Police Commission of New\r\nYork for the two following years. Mayor Strong had been elected Mayor\r\nthe preceding fall, when the general anti-Democratic wave of that year\r\ncoincided with one of the city's occasional insurrections of virtue and\r\nconsequent turning out of Tammany from municipal control. He had been\r\nelected on a non-partisan ticket--usually (although not always) the\r\nright kind of ticket in municipal affairs, provided it represents not\r\na bargain among factions but genuine non-partisanship with the genuine\r\npurpose to get the right men in control of the city government on a\r\nplatform which deals with the needs of the average men and women, the\r\nmen and women who work hard and who too often live hard. I was appointed\r\nwith the distinct understanding that I was to administer the Police\r\nDepartment with entire disregard of partisan politics, and only from the\r\nstandpoint of a good citizen interested in promoting the welfare of all\r\ngood citizens. My task, therefore, was really simple. Mayor Strong had\r\nalready offered me the Street-Cleaning Department. For this work I did\r\nnot feel that I had any especial fitness. I resolutely refused to accept\r\nthe position, and the Mayor ultimately got a far better man for his\r\npurpose in Colonel George F. Waring. The work of the Police Department,\r\nhowever, was in my line, and I was glad to undertake it.\r\n\r\nThe man who was closest to me throughout my two years in the Police\r\nDepartment was Jacob Riis. By this time, as I have said, I was\r\ngetting our social, industrial, and political needs into pretty fair\r\nperspective. I was still ignorant of the extent to which big men of\r\ngreat wealth played a mischievous part in our industrial and social\r\nlife, but I was well awake to the need of making ours in good faith\r\nboth an economic and an industrial as well as a political democracy. I\r\nalready knew Jake Riis, because his book \"How the Other Half Lives\" had\r\nbeen to me both an enlightenment and an inspiration for which I felt I\r\ncould never be too grateful. Soon after it was written I had called at\r\nhis office to tell him how deeply impressed I was by the book, and that\r\nI wished to help him in any practical way to try to make things a little\r\nbetter. I have always had a horror of words that are not translated\r\ninto deeds, of speech that does not result in action--in other words,\r\nI believe in realizable ideals and in realizing them, in preaching what\r\ncan be practiced and then in practicing it. Jacob Riis had drawn an\r\nindictment of the things that were wrong, pitifully and dreadfully\r\nwrong, with the tenement homes and the tenement lives of our\r\nwage-workers. In his book he had pointed out how the city government,\r\nand especially those connected with the departments of police and\r\nhealth, could aid in remedying some of the wrongs.\r\n\r\nAs President of the Police Board I was also a member of the Health\r\nBoard. In both positions I felt that with Jacob Riis's guidance I would\r\nbe able to put a goodly number of his principles into actual effect.\r\nHe and I looked at life and its problems from substantially the same\r\nstandpoint. Our ideals and principles and purposes, and our beliefs as\r\nto the methods necessary to realize them, were alike. After the election\r\nin 1894 I had written him a letter which ran in part as follows:\r\n\r\nIt is very important to the city to have a business man's Mayor, but it\r\nis more important to have a workingman's Mayor; and I want Mr. Strong to\r\nbe that also. . . . It is an excellent thing to have rapid transit, but\r\nit is a good deal more important, if you look at matters with a proper\r\nperspective, to have ample playgrounds in the poorer quarters of the\r\ncity, and to take the children off the streets so as to prevent them\r\ngrowing up toughs. In the same way it is an admirable thing to have\r\nclean streets; indeed, it is an essential thing to have them; but it\r\nwould be a better thing to have our schools large enough to give ample\r\naccommodation to all who should be pupils and to provide them with\r\nproper playgrounds.\r\n\r\nAnd I added, while expressing my regret that I had not been able to\r\naccept the street-cleaning commissionership, that \"I would have\r\nbeen delighted to smash up the corrupt contractors and put the\r\nstreet-cleaning force absolutely out of the domain of politics.\"\r\n\r\nThis was nineteen years ago, but it makes a pretty good platform in\r\nmunicipal politics even to-day--smash corruption, take the municipal\r\nservice out of the domain of politics, insist upon having a Mayor who\r\nshall be a workingman's Mayor even more than a business man's Mayor, and\r\ndevote all attention possible to the welfare of the children.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as I viewed it, there were two sides to the work: first, the\r\nactual handling of the Police Department; second, using my position to\r\nhelp in making the city a better place in which to live and work for\r\nthose to whom the conditions of life and labor were hardest. The two\r\nproblems were closely connected; for one thing never to be forgotten in\r\nstriving to better the conditions of the New York police force is the\r\nconnection between the standard of morals and behavior in that force and\r\nthe general standard of morals and behavior in the city at large. The\r\nform of government of the Police Department at that time was such as\r\nto make it a matter of extreme difficulty to get good results. It\r\nrepresented that device of old-school American political thought, the\r\ndesire to establish checks and balances so elaborate that no man shall\r\nhave power enough to do anything very bad. In practice this always means\r\nthat no man has power enough to do anything good, and that what is bad\r\nis done anyhow.\r\n\r\nIn most positions the \"division of powers\" theory works unmitigated\r\nmischief. The only way to get good service is to give somebody power to\r\nrender it, facing the fact that power which will enable a man to do\r\na job well will also necessarily enable him to do it ill if he is the\r\nwrong kind of man. What is normally needed is the concentration in the\r\nhands of one man, or of a very small body of men, of ample power to\r\nenable him or them to do the work that is necessary; and then the\r\ndevising of means to hold these men fully responsible for the exercise\r\nof that power by the people. This of course means that, if the people\r\nare willing to see power misused, it will be misused. But it also means\r\nthat if, as we hold, the people are fit for self-government--if, in\r\nother words, our talk and our institutions are not shams--we will get\r\ngood government. I do not contend that my theory will automatically\r\nbring good government. I do contend that it will enable us to get as\r\ngood government as we deserve, and that the other way will not.\r\n\r\nThe then government of the Police Department was so devised as to render\r\nit most difficult to accomplish anything good, while the field for\r\nintrigue and conspiracy was limitless. There were four Commissioners,\r\ntwo supposed to belong to one party and two to the other, although, as\r\na matter of fact, they never divided on party lines. There was a Chief,\r\nappointed by the Commissioners, but whom they could not remove without a\r\nregular trial subject to review by the courts of law. This Chief and\r\nany one Commissioner had power to hold up most of the acts of the other\r\nthree Commissioners. It was made easy for the four Commissioners to come\r\nto a deadlock among themselves; and if this danger was avoided, it was\r\neasy for one Commissioner, by intriguing with the Chief, to bring the\r\nother three to a standstill. The Commissioners were appointed by the\r\nMayor, but he could not remove them without the assent of the Governor,\r\nwho was usually politically opposed to him. In the same way the\r\nCommissioners could appoint the patrolmen, but they could not remove\r\nthem, save after a trial which went up for review to the courts.\r\n\r\nAs was inevitable under our system of law procedure, this meant that the\r\naction of the court was apt to be determined by legal technicalities.\r\nIt was possible to dismiss a man from the service for quite insufficient\r\nreasons, and to provide against the reversal of the sentence, if the\r\ntechnicalities of procedure were observed. But the worst criminals\r\nwere apt to be adroit men, against whom it was impossible to get legal\r\nevidence which a court could properly consider in a criminal trial\r\n(and the mood of the court might be to treat the case as if it were a\r\ncriminal trial), although it was easy to get evidence which would render\r\nit not merely justifiable but necessary for a man to remove them from\r\nhis private employ--and surely the public should be as well treated as\r\na private employer. Accordingly, most of the worst men put out were\r\nreinstated by the courts; and when the Mayor attempted to remove one of\r\nmy colleagues who made it his business to try to nullify the work done\r\nby the rest of us, the Governor sided with the recalcitrant Commissioner\r\nand refused to permit his removal.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, an astounding quantity of work was done in reforming the\r\nforce. We had a good deal of power, anyhow; we exercised it to the full;\r\nand we accomplished some things by assuming the appearance of a power\r\nwhich we did not really possess.\r\n\r\nThe first fight I made was to keep politics absolutely out of the force;\r\nand not only politics, but every kind of improper favoritism. Doubtless\r\nin making thousands of appointments and hundreds of promotions there\r\nwere men who contrived to use influence of which I was ignorant. But\r\nthese cases must have been few and far between. As far as was humanly\r\npossible, the appointments and promotions were made without regard to\r\nany question except the fitness of the man and the needs of the\r\nservice. As Civil Service Commissioner I had been instructing heads\r\nof departments and bureaus how to get men appointed without regard to\r\npolitics, and assuring them that by following our methods they\r\nwould obtain first-class results. As Police Commissioner I was able\r\npractically to apply my own teachings.\r\n\r\nThe appointments to the police force were made as I have described\r\nin the last chapter. We paid not the slightest attention to a man's\r\npolitics or creed, or where he was born, so long as he was an American\r\ncitizen; and on an average we obtained far and away the best men\r\nthat had ever come into the Police Department. It was of course very\r\ndifficult at first to convince both the politicians and the people that\r\nwe really meant what we said, and that every one really would have a\r\nfair trial. There had been in previous years the most widespread\r\nand gross corruption in connection with every activity in the Police\r\nDepartment, and there had been a regular tariff for appointments\r\nand promotions. Many powerful politicians and many corrupt outsiders\r\nbelieved that in some way or other it would still be possible to secure\r\nappointments by corrupt and improper methods, and many good citizens\r\nfelt the same conviction. I endeavored to remove the impression from the\r\nminds of both sets of people by giving the widest publicity to what we\r\nwere doing and how we were doing it, by making the whole process open\r\nand aboveboard, and by making it evident that we would probe to the\r\nbottom every charge of corruption.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I received visits at one time from a Catholic priest, and\r\nat another time from a Methodist clergyman, who had parishioners who\r\nwished to enter the police force, but who did not believe they could\r\nget in save by the payment of money or through political pressure. The\r\npriest was running a temperance lyceum in connection with his church,\r\nand he wished to know if there would be a chance for some of the young\r\nmen who belonged to that lyceum. The Methodist clergyman came from a\r\nlittle patch of old native America which by a recent extension had been\r\ntaken within the limits of the huge, polyglot, pleasure-loving city. His\r\nwas a small church, most of the members being shipwrights, mechanics,\r\nand sailormen from the local coasters. In each case I assured my visitor\r\nthat we wanted on the force men of the exact type which he said he could\r\nfurnish. I also told him that I was as anxious as he was to find out\r\nif there was any improper work being done in connection with the\r\nexaminations, and that I would like him to get four or five of his men\r\nto take the examinations without letting me know their names. Then,\r\nwhether the men failed or succeeded, he and I would take their papers\r\nand follow them through every stage so that we could tell at once\r\nwhether they had been either improperly favored or improperly\r\ndiscriminated against. This was accordingly done, and in each case my\r\nvisitor turned up a few weeks later, his face wreathed in smiles, to\r\nsay that his candidates had passed and that everything was evidently all\r\nstraight. During my two years as President of the Commission I think\r\nI appointed a dozen or fifteen members of that little Methodist\r\ncongregation, and certainly twice that number of men from the temperance\r\nlyceum of the Catholic church in question. They were all men of the\r\nvery type I most wished to see on the force--men of strong physique and\r\nresolute temper, sober, self-respecting, self-reliant, with a strong\r\nwish to improve themselves.\r\n\r\nOccasionally I would myself pick out a man and tell him to take the\r\nexamination. Thus one evening I went down to speak in the Bowery at\r\nthe Young Men's Institute, a branch of the Young Men's Christian\r\nAssociation, at the request of Mr. Cleveland H. Dodge. While there\r\nhe told me he wished to show me a young Jew who had recently, by an\r\nexhibition of marked pluck and bodily prowess, saved some women and\r\nchildren from a burning building. The young Jew, whose name was\r\nOtto Raphael, was brought up to see me; a powerful fellow, with a\r\ngood-humored, intelligent face. I asked him about his education, and\r\ntold him to try the examination. He did, passed, was appointed, and\r\nmade an admirable officer; and he and all his family, wherever they may\r\ndwell, have been close friends of mine ever since. Otto Raphael was a\r\ngenuine East Sider. He and I were both \"straight New York,\" to use the\r\nvernacular of our native city. To show our community of feeling and our\r\ngrasp of the facts of life, I may mention that we were almost the only\r\nmen in the Police Department who picked Fitzsimmons as a winner against\r\nCorbett. Otto's parents had come over from Russia, and not only in\r\nsocial standing but in pay a policeman's position meant everything to\r\nhim. It enabled Otto to educate his little brothers and sisters who had\r\nbeen born in this country, and to bring over from Russia two or three\r\nkinsfolk who had perforce been left behind.\r\n\r\nRather curiously, it was by no means as easy to keep politics and\r\ncorruption out of the promotions as out of the entrance examinations.\r\nThis was because I could take complete charge of the entrance\r\nexaminations myself; and, moreover, they were largely automatic. In\r\npromotions, on the other hand, the prime element was the record and\r\ncapacity of the officer, and for this we had largely to rely upon the\r\njudgment of the man's immediate superiors. This doubtless meant that in\r\ncertain cases that judgment was given for improper reasons.\r\n\r\nHowever, there were cases where I could act on personal knowledge. One\r\nthing that we did was to endeavor to recognize gallantry. We did not\r\nhave to work a revolution in the force as to courage in the way that\r\nwe had to work a revolution in honesty. They had always been brave\r\nin dealing with riotous and violent criminals. But they had gradually\r\nbecome very corrupt. Our great work, therefore, was the stamping out of\r\ndishonesty, and this work we did thoroughly, so far as the ridiculous\r\nbi-partisan law under which the Department was administered would\r\npermit. But we were anxious that, while stamping out what was evil in\r\nthe force, we should keep and improve what was good. While warring\r\non dishonesty, we made every effort to increase efficiency. It has\r\nunfortunately been shown by sad experience that at times a police\r\norganization which is free from the taint of corruption may yet show\r\nitself weak in some great crisis or unable to deal with the more\r\ndangerous kinds of criminals. This we were determined to prevent.\r\n\r\nOur efforts were crowned with entire success. The improvement in the\r\nefficiency of the force went hand in hand with the improvement in\r\nits honesty. The men in uniform and the men in plain clothes--the\r\ndetectives--did better work than ever before. The aggregate of crimes\r\nwhere punishment followed the commission of the crime increased, while\r\nthe aggregate of crimes where the criminal escaped punishment decreased.\r\nEvery discredited politician, every sensational newspaper, and every\r\ntimid fool who could be scared by clamor was against us. All three\r\nclasses strove by every means in their power to show that in making the\r\nforce honest we had impaired its efficiency; and by their utterances\r\nthey tended to bring about the very condition of things against which\r\nthey professed to protest. But we went steadily along the path we\r\nhad marked out. The fight was hard, and there was plenty of worry and\r\nanxiety, but we won. I was appointed in May, 1895. In February, 1897,\r\nthree months before I resigned to become Assistant Secretary of the\r\nNavy, the Judge who charged the Grand Jury of New York County was able\r\nto congratulate them on the phenomenal decrease in crime, especially\r\nof the violent sort. This decrease was steady during the two years.\r\nThe police, after the reform policy was thoroughly tried, proved more\r\nsuccessful than ever before in protecting life and property and in\r\nputting down crime and criminal vice.\r\n\r\nThe part played by the recognition and reward of actual personal prowess\r\namong the members of the police force in producing this state of affairs\r\nwas appreciable, though there were many other factors that combined to\r\nbring about the betterment. The immense improvement in discipline\r\nby punishing all offenders without mercy, no matter how great their\r\npolitical or personal influence; the resolute warfare against every kind\r\nof criminal who had hitherto been able corruptly to purchase protection;\r\nthe prompt recognition of ability even where it was entirely unconnected\r\nwith personal prowess--all these were elements which had enormous weight\r\nin producing the change. Mere courage and daring, and the rewarding of\r\ncourage and daring, cannot supply the lack of discipline, of ability,\r\nof honesty. But they are of vital consequence, nevertheless. No police\r\nforce is worth anything if its members are not intelligent and honest;\r\nbut neither is it worth anything unless its members are brave, hardy,\r\nand well disciplined.\r\n\r\nWe showed recognition of daring and of personal prowess in two ways:\r\nfirst, by awarding a medal or a certificate in remembrance of the deed;\r\nand, second, by giving it weight in making any promotion, especially to\r\nthe lower grades. In the higher grades--in all promotions above that of\r\nsergeant, for instance--resolute and daring courage cannot normally\r\nbe considered as a factor of determining weight in making promotions;\r\nrather is it a quality the lack of which unfits a man for promotion. For\r\nin the higher places we must assume the existence of such a quality in\r\nany fit candidate, and must make the promotion with a view to the man's\r\nenergy, executive capacity, and power of command. In the lower grades,\r\nhowever, marked gallantry should always be taken into account in\r\ndeciding among different candidates for any given place.\r\n\r\nDuring our two years' service we found it necessary over a hundred times\r\nto single out men for special mention because of some feat of heroism.\r\nThe heroism usually took one of four forms: saving somebody from\r\ndrowning, saving somebody from a burning building, stopping a\r\nrunaway team, or arresting some violent lawbreaker under exceptional\r\ncircumstances. To illustrate our method of action, I will take two of\r\nthe first promotions made after I became Commissioner. One case was\r\nthat of an old fellow, a veteran of the Civil War, who was at the time\r\na roundsman. I happened to notice one day that he had saved a woman from\r\ndrowning, and had him summoned so that I might look into the matter.\r\nThe old fellow brought up his record before me, and showed not a little\r\nnervousness and agitation; for it appeared that he had grown gray in the\r\nservice, had performed feat after feat of heroism, but had no political\r\nbacking of any account. No heed had ever been paid him. He was one of\r\nthe quiet men who attend solely to duty, and although a Grand Army\r\nman, he had never sought to use influence of any kind. Now, at last, he\r\nthought there was a chance for him. He had been twenty-two years on\r\nthe force, and during that time had saved some twenty-five persons from\r\ndeath by drowning, varying the performance two or three times by\r\nsaving persons from burning buildings. Twice Congress had passed laws\r\nespecially to empower the then Secretary of the Treasury, John Sherman,\r\nto give him a medal for distinguished gallantry in saving life. The\r\nLife-Saving Society had also given him its medal, and so had the Police\r\nDepartment. There was not a complaint in all his record against him\r\nfor any infraction of duty, and he was sober and trustworthy. He was\r\nentitled to his promotion; and he got it, there and then. It may be\r\nworth mentioning that he kept on saving life after he was given his\r\nsergeantcy. On October 21, 1896, he again rescued a man from drowning.\r\nIt was at night, nobody else was in the neighborhood, and the dock from\r\nwhich he jumped was in absolute darkness, and he was ten minutes in the\r\nwater, which was very cold. He was fifty-five years old when he saved\r\nthis man. It was the twenty-ninth person whose life he had saved during\r\nhis twenty-three years' service in the Department.\r\n\r\nThe other man was a patrolman whom we promoted to roundsman for activity\r\nin catching a burglar under rather peculiar circumstances. I happened to\r\nnote his getting a burglar one week. Apparently he had fallen into the\r\nhabit, for he got another next week. In the latter case the burglar\r\nescaped from the house soon after midnight, and ran away toward Park\r\nAvenue, with the policeman in hot chase. The New York Central Railroad\r\nruns under Park Avenue, and there is a succession of openings in the\r\ntop of the tunnel. Finding that the policeman was gaining on him, the\r\nburglar took a desperate chance and leaped down one of these openings,\r\nat the risk of breaking his neck. Now the burglar was running for his\r\nliberty, and it was the part of wisdom for him to imperil life or limb;\r\nbut the policeman was merely doing his duty, and nobody could have\r\nblamed him for not taking the jump. However, he jumped; and in this\r\nparticular case the hand of the Lord was heavy upon the unrighteous. The\r\nburglar had the breath knocked out of him, and the \"cop\" didn't.\r\nWhen his victim could walk, the officer trotted him around to the\r\nstation-house; and a week after I had the officer up and promoted him,\r\nfor he was sober, trustworthy, and strictly attentive to duty.\r\n\r\nNow I think that any decent man of reasonable intelligence will agree\r\nthat we were quite right in promoting men in cases like these, and quite\r\nright in excluding politics from promotions. Yet it was because of our\r\nconsistently acting in this manner, resolutely warring on dishonesty\r\nand on that peculiar form of baseness which masquerades as \"practical\"\r\npolitics, and steadily refusing to pay heed to any consideration\r\nexcept the good of the service and the city, and the merits of the men\r\nthemselves, that we drew down upon our heads the bitter and malignant\r\nanimosity of the bread-and-butter spoils politicians. They secured the\r\nrepeal of the Civil Service Law by the State Legislature. They attempted\r\nand almost succeeded in the effort to legislate us out of office. They\r\njoined with the baser portion of the sensational press in every species\r\nof foul, indecent falsehood and slander as to what we were doing. They\r\nattempted to seduce or frighten us by every species of intrigue and\r\ncajolery, of promise of political reward and threat of political\r\npunishment. They failed in their purpose. I believe in political\r\norganizations, and I believe in practical politics. If a man is\r\nnot practical, he is of no use anywhere. But when politicians treat\r\npractical politics as foul politics, and when they turn what ought to\r\nbe a necessary and useful political organization into a machine run by\r\nprofessional spoilsmen of low morality in their own interest, then it\r\nis time to drive the politician from public life, and either to mend or\r\ndestroy the machine, according as the necessity may determine.\r\n\r\nWe promoted to roundsman a patrolman, with an already excellent record,\r\nfor gallantry shown in a fray which resulted in the death of his\r\nantagonist. He was after a gang of toughs who had just waylaid, robbed,\r\nand beaten a man. They scattered and he pursued the ringleader. Running\r\nhard, he gained on his man, whereupon the latter suddenly turned and\r\nfired full in his face. The officer already had his revolver drawn,\r\nand the two shots rang out almost together. The policeman was within\r\na fraction of death, for the bullet from his opponent's pistol went\r\nthrough his helmet and just broke the skin of his head. His own aim was\r\ntruer, and the man he was after fell dead, shot through the heart. I\r\nmay explain that I have not the slightest sympathy with any policy which\r\ntends to put the policeman at the mercy of a tough, or which deprives\r\nhim of efficient weapons. While Police Commissioner we punished any\r\nbrutality by the police with such immediate severity that all cases of\r\nbrutality practically came to an end. No decent citizen had anything\r\nto fear from the police during the two years of my service. But we\r\nconsistently encouraged the police to prove that the violent criminal\r\nwho endeavored to molest them or to resist arrest, or to interfere with\r\nthem in the discharge of their duty, was himself in grave jeopardy; and\r\nwe had every \"gang\" broken up and the members punished with whatever\r\nseverity was necessary. Of course where possible the officer merely\r\ncrippled the criminal who was violent.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that we did while in office was to train the men in\r\nthe use of the pistol. A school of pistol practice was established,\r\nand the marksmanship of the force was wonderfully improved. The man\r\nin charge of the school was a roundsman, Petty, whom we promoted to\r\nsergeant. He was one of the champion revolver shots of the country,\r\nand could hit just about where he aimed. Twice he was forced to fire at\r\ncriminals who resisted arrest, and in each case he hit his man in the\r\narm or leg, simply stopping him without danger to his life.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1896, a number of burglaries occurred far uptown, in the\r\nneighborhood of One Hundred and Fifty-sixth Street and Union Avenue.\r\nTwo officers were sent out each night to patrol the streets in plain\r\nclothes. About two o'clock on the morning of May 8 they caught a glimpse\r\nof two men loitering about a large corner house, and determined to\r\nmake them explain their actions. In order to cut off their escape, one\r\nofficer went down one street and one the other. The first officer, whose\r\nname was Ryan, found the two men at the gateway of the side entrance of\r\nthe house, and hailed to know what they were doing. Without answering,\r\nthey turned and ran toward Prospect Avenue, with Ryan in close pursuit.\r\nAfter running about one hundred feet, one of them turned and fired three\r\nshots at Ryan, but failed to hit him. The two then separated, and the\r\nman who had done the shooting escaped. The other man, whose name proved\r\nto be O'Connor, again took to his heels, with Ryan still after him;\r\nthey turned the corner and met the other officer, whose name was Reid,\r\nrunning as hard as he could toward the shooting. When O'Connor saw\r\nhimself cut off by Reid, he fired at his new foe, the bullet cutting\r\nReid's overcoat on the left shoulder. Reid promptly fired in return,\r\nhis bullet going into O'Connor's neck and causing him to turn a complete\r\nsomersault. The two officers then cared for their prisoner until the\r\nambulance arrived, when he was taken to the hospital and pronounced\r\nmortally wounded. His companion was afterward caught, and they turned\r\nout to be the very burglars for whom Reid and Ryan had been on the\r\nlookout.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1896, one of our officers was shot. A row occurred in a\r\nrestaurant, which ended in two young toughs drawing their revolvers\r\nand literally running amuck, shooting two or three men. A policeman,\r\nattracted by the noise, ran up and seized one of them, whereupon the\r\nother shot him in the mouth, wounding him badly. Nevertheless, the\r\nofficer kept his prisoner and carried him to the station-house. The\r\ntough who had done the shooting ran out and was seized by another\r\nofficer. The tough fired at him, the bullet passing through the\r\nofficer's overcoat, but he was promptly knocked down, disarmed, and\r\nbrought to the station-house. In this case neither policeman used his\r\nrevolver, and each brought in his man, although the latter was armed and\r\nresisted arrest, one of the officers taking in his prisoner after having\r\nbeen himself severely wounded. A lamentable feature of the case was that\r\nthis same officer was a man who, though capable of great gallantry, was\r\nalso given to shirking his work, and we were finally obliged to dismiss\r\nhim from the force, after passing over two or three glaring misdeeds in\r\nview of his record for courage.\r\n\r\nWe promoted another man on account of finding out accidentally that he\r\nhad performed a notable feat, which he had forborne even to mention,\r\nso that his name never came on the roll of honor. Late at night, while\r\npatrolling a lonely part of his post, he came upon three young toughs\r\nwho had turned highwaymen and were robbing a peddler. He ran in at once\r\nwith his night-stick, whereupon the toughs showed fight, and one of\r\nthem struck at him with a bludgeon, breaking his left hand. The officer,\r\nhowever, made such good use of his night-stick that he knocked down two\r\nof his assailants, whereupon the third ran away, and he brought both of\r\nhis prisoners to the station-house. Then he went round to the hospital,\r\nhad his broken hand set in plaster, and actually reported for duty at\r\nthe next tour, without losing one hour. He was a quiet fellow, with a\r\nrecord free from complaints, and we made him roundsman.\r\n\r\nThe mounted squad have, of course, many opportunities to distinguish\r\nthemselves in stopping runaways. In May, 1895, a mounted policeman\r\nnamed Heyer succeeded in stopping a runaway at Kingsbridge under rather\r\nnoteworthy circumstances. Two men were driving in a buggy, when the\r\nhorse stumbled, and in recovering himself broke the head-stall, so that\r\nthe bridle fell off. The horse was a spirited trotter, and at once ran\r\naway at full speed. Heyer saw the occurrence, and followed at a run.\r\nWhen he got alongside the runaway he seized him by the forelock, guided\r\nhim dexterously over the bridge, preventing him from running into the\r\nnumerous wagons that were on the road, and finally forced him up a hill\r\nand into a wagon-shed. Three months later this same officer saved a man\r\nfrom drowning.\r\n\r\nThe members of the bicycle squad, which was established shortly after we\r\ntook office, soon grew to show not only extraordinary proficiency on\r\nthe wheel, but extraordinary daring. They frequently stopped runaways,\r\nwheeling alongside of them, and grasping the horses while going at full\r\nspeed; and, what was even more remarkable, they managed not only to\r\novertake but to jump into the vehicle and capture, on two or three\r\ndifferent occasions, men who were guilty of reckless driving, and who\r\nfought violently in resisting arrest. They were picked men, being young\r\nand active, and any feat of daring which could be accomplished on the\r\nwheel they were certain to accomplish.\r\n\r\nThree of the best riders of the bicycle squad, whose names and records\r\nhappen to occur to me, were men of the three ethnic strains most\r\nstrongly represented in the New York police force, being respectively of\r\nnative American, German, and Irish parentage.\r\n\r\nThe German was a man of enormous power, and he was able to stop each\r\nof the many runaways he tackled without losing his wheel. Choosing his\r\ntime, he would get alongside the horse and seize the bit in his left\r\nhand, keeping his right on the crossbar of the wheel. By degrees he then\r\ngot the animal under control. He never failed to stop it, and he\r\nnever lost his wheel. He also never failed to overtake any \"scorcher,\"\r\nalthough many of these were professional riders who deliberately\r\nviolated the law to see if they could not get away from him; for the\r\nwheelmen soon get to know the officers whose beats they cross.\r\n\r\nThe Yankee, though a tall, powerful man and a very good rider, scarcely\r\ncame up to the German in either respect; he possessed exceptional\r\nability, however, as well as exceptional nerve and coolness, and he also\r\nwon his promotion. He stopped about as many runaways; but when the\r\nhorse was really panic-stricken he usually had to turn his wheel loose,\r\ngetting a firm grip on the horse's reins and then kicking his wheel\r\nso that it would fall out of the way of injury from the wagon. On one\r\noccasion he had a fight with a drunken and reckless driver who was\r\nurging to top speed a spirited horse. He first got hold of the horse,\r\nwhereupon the driver lashed both him and the beast, and the animal,\r\nalready mad with terror, could not be stopped. The officer had of course\r\nkicked away his wheel at the beginning, and after being dragged along\r\nfor some distance he let go the beast and made a grab at the wagon.\r\nThe driver hit him with his whip, but he managed to get in, and after\r\na vigorous tussle overcame his man, and disposed of him by getting him\r\ndown and sitting on him. This left his hands free for the reins. By\r\ndegrees he got the horse under control, and drove the wagon round to the\r\nstation-house, still sitting on his victim. \"I jounced up and down\r\non him to keep him quiet when he turned ugly,\" he remarked to me\r\nparenthetically. Having disposed of the wagon, he took the man round to\r\nthe court, and on the way the prisoner suddenly sprang on him and tried\r\nto throttle him. Convinced at last that patience had ceased to be a\r\nvirtue, he quieted his assailant with a smash on the head that took all\r\nthe fight out of him until he was brought before the judge and fined.\r\nLike the other \"bicycle cops,\" this officer made a number of arrests of\r\ncriminals, such as thieves, highwaymen, and the like, in addition to his\r\nnatural prey--scorchers, runaways, and reckless drivers.\r\n\r\nThe third member of the trio, a tall, sinewy man with flaming red hair,\r\nwhich rather added to the terror he inspired in evil-doers, was usually\r\nstationed in a tough part of the city, where there was a tendency to\r\ncrimes of violence, and incidentally an occasional desire to harass\r\nwheelmen. The officer was as good off his wheel as on it, and he\r\nspeedily established perfect order on his beat, being always willing to\r\n\"take chances\" in getting his man. He was no respecter of persons,\r\nand when it became his duty to arrest a wealthy man for persistently\r\nrefusing to have his carriage lamps lighted after nightfall, he brought\r\nhim in with the same indifference that he displayed in arresting a\r\nstreet-corner tough who had thrown a brick at a wheelman.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a policeman would perform work which ordinarily comes\r\nwithin the domain of the fireman. In November, 1896, an officer who had\r\npreviously saved a man from death by drowning added to his record by\r\nsaving five persons from burning. He was at the time asleep, when he was\r\naroused by a fire in a house a few doors away. Running over the roofs\r\nof the adjoining houses until he reached the burning building, he\r\nfound that on the fourth floor the flames had cut off all exit from an\r\napartment in which there were four women, two of them over fifty, and\r\none of the others with a six-months-old baby. The officer ran down to\r\nthe adjoining house, broke open the door of the apartment on the same\r\nfloor--the fourth--and crept out on the coping, less than three inches\r\nwide, that ran from one house to the other. Being a large and very\r\npowerful and active man, he managed to keep hold of the casing of the\r\nwindow with one hand, and with the other to reach to the window of the\r\napartment where the women and child were. The firemen appeared, and\r\nstretched a net underneath. The crowd that was looking on suddenly\r\nbecame motionless and silent. Then, one by one, he drew the women out of\r\ntheir window, and, holding them tight against the wall, passed them into\r\nthe other window. The exertion in such an attitude was great, and he\r\nstrained himself badly; but he possessed a practical mind, and as soon\r\nas the women were saved he began a prompt investigation of the cause\r\nof the fire, and arrested two men whose carelessness, as was afterward\r\nproved, caused it.\r\n\r\nNow and then a man, though a brave man, proved to be slack or stupid or\r\nvicious, and we could make nothing out of him; but hardihood and courage\r\nwere qualities upon which we insisted and which we rewarded. Whenever\r\nI see the police force attacked and vilified, I always remember my\r\nassociation with it. The cases I have given above are merely instances\r\nchosen almost at random among hundreds of others. Men such as those\r\nI have mentioned have the right stuff in them! If they go wrong, the\r\ntrouble is with the system, and therefore with us, the citizens, for\r\npermitting the system to go unchanged. The conditions of New York life\r\nare such as to make the police problem therein more difficult than in\r\nany other of the world's great capitals. I am often asked if policemen\r\nare honest. I believe that the great majority of them want to be honest\r\nand will be honest whenever they are given the chance. The New York\r\npolice force is a body thoroughly representative of the great city\r\nitself. As I have said above, the predominant ethnic strains in it are,\r\nfirst, the men of Irish birth or parentage, and, following these, the\r\nnative Americans, usually from the country districts, and the men of\r\nGerman birth or parentage. There are also Jews, Scandinavians, Italians,\r\nSlavs, and men of other nationalities. All soon become welded into one\r\nbody. They are physically a fine lot. Moreover, their instincts are\r\nright; they are game, they are alert and self-reliant, they prefer to\r\nact squarely if they are allowed so to act. All that they need is to be\r\ngiven the chance to prove themselves honest, brave, and self-respecting.\r\n\r\nThe law at present is much better than in our day, so far as governing\r\nthe force is concerned. There is now a single Commissioner, and the\r\nMayor has complete power over him. The Mayor, through his Commissioner,\r\nnow has power to keep the police force on a good level of conduct if\r\nwith resolution and common sense he insists on absolute honesty within\r\nthe force and at the same time heartily supports it against the criminal\r\nclasses. To weaken the force in its dealings with gangs and toughs\r\nand criminals generally is as damaging as to permit dishonesty, and,\r\nmoreover, works towards dishonesty. But while under the present law very\r\nmuch improvement can be worked, there is need of change of the law which\r\nwill make the Police Commissioner a permanent, non-partisan official,\r\nholding office so long as he proves thoroughly fit for the job,\r\ncompletely independent of the politicians and privileged interests, and\r\nwith complete power over the force. This means that there must be the\r\nright law, and the right public opinion back of the law.\r\n\r\nThe many-sided ethnic character of the force now and then gives rise to,\r\nor affords opportunity for, queer happenings. Occasionally it enables\r\none to meet emergencies in the best possible fashion. While I was Police\r\nCommissioner an anti-Semitic preacher from Berlin, Rector Ahlwardt, came\r\nover to New York to preach a crusade against the Jews. Many of the New\r\nYork Jews were much excited and asked me to prevent him from speaking\r\nand not to give him police protection. This, I told them, was\r\nimpossible; and if possible would have been undesirable because it\r\nwould have made him a martyr. The proper thing to do was to make him\r\nridiculous. Accordingly I detailed for his protection a Jew sergeant and\r\na score or two of Jew policemen. He made his harangue against the Jews\r\nunder the active protection of some forty policemen, every one of them a\r\nJew! It was the most effective possible answer; and incidentally it was\r\nan object-lesson to our people, whose greatest need it is to learn that\r\nthere must be no division by class hatred, whether this hatred be that\r\nof creed against creed, nationality against nationality, section against\r\nsection, or men of one social or industrial condition against men\r\nof another social and industrial condition. We must ever judge each\r\nindividual on his own conduct and merits, and not on his membership\r\nin any class, whether that class be based on theological, social, or\r\nindustrial considerations.\r\n\r\nAmong my political opponents when I was Police Commissioner was the\r\nhead of a very influential local Democratic organization. He was a\r\nState Senator usually known as Big Tim Sullivan. Big Tim represented\r\nthe morals of another era; that is, his principles and actions were very\r\nmuch those of a Norman noble in the years immediately succeeding the\r\nBattle of Hastings. (This will seem flattery only to those who are not\r\nacquainted with the real histories and antecedents of the Norman nobles\r\nof the epoch in question.) His application of these eleventh-century\r\ntheories to our nineteenth-century municipal democratic conditions\r\nbrought him into sharp contact with me, and with one of my right-hand\r\nmen in the Department, Inspector John McCullough. Under the old\r\ndispensation this would have meant that his friends and kinsfolk were\r\nunder the ban.\r\n\r\nNow it happened that in the Department at that time there was a\r\nnephew or cousin of his, Jerry D. Sullivan. I found that Jerry was an\r\nuncommonly good man, a conscientious, capable officer, and I promoted\r\nhim. I do not know whether Jerry or Jerry's cousin (Senator Sullivan)\r\nwas more astonished. The Senator called upon me to express what I am\r\nsure was a very genuine feeling of appreciation. Poor Jerry died, I\r\nthink of consumption, a year or two after I left the Department. He was\r\npromoted again after I left, and he then showed that he possessed the\r\nvery rare quality of gratitude, for he sent me a telegram dated January\r\n15, 1898, running as follows: \"Was made sergeant to-day. I thank you for\r\nall in my first advancement.\" And in a letter written to me he said: \"In\r\nthe future, as in the past, I will endeavor at all times to perform my\r\nduty honestly and fearlessly, and never cause you to feel that you were\r\nmistaken in me, so that you will be justly proud of my record.\" The\r\nSenator, though politically opposed to me, always kept a feeling of\r\nfriendship for me after this incident. He served in Congress while I was\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nThe police can be used to help all kinds of good purposes. When I was\r\nPolice Commissioner much difficulty had been encountered in locating\r\nillegal and fraudulent practitioners of medicine. Dr. Maurice Lewi\r\ncalled on me, with a letter from James Russell Parsons, the Secretary of\r\nthe Board of Regents at Albany, and asked me if I could not help.\r\nAfter questioning him I found that the local authorities were eager to\r\nprosecute these men, but could not locate them; and I made up my mind\r\nI would try my hand at it. Accordingly, a sealed order was sent to the\r\ncommanding officer of each police precinct in New York, not to be opened\r\nuntil just before the morning roll call, previous to the police squad\r\ngoing on duty. This order required that, immediately upon reaching post,\r\neach patrolman should go over his beat and enter upon a sheet of paper,\r\nprovided for that purpose, the full name and address of every doctor\r\nsign there appearing. Immediately upon securing this information, the\r\npatrolman was instructed to return the sheet to the officer in charge of\r\nthe precinct. The latter in turn was instructed to collect and place\r\nin one large envelope and to return to Police Headquarters all the\r\ndata thus received. As a result of this procedure, within two hours the\r\nprosecuting officials of the city of New York were in possession of the\r\nname and address of every person in New York who announced himself as\r\na physician; and scores of pretended physicians were brought to book or\r\ndriven from the city.\r\n\r\nOne of the perennially serious and difficult problems, and one of the\r\nchief reasons for police blackmail and corruption, is to be found in the\r\nexcise situation in New York. When I was Police Commissioner, New York\r\nwas a city with twelve or fifteen thousand saloons, with a State law\r\nwhich said they should be closed on Sundays, and with a local sentiment\r\nwhich put a premium on violating the law by making Sunday the most\r\nprofitable day in the week to the saloon-keeper who was willing to take\r\nchances. It was this willingness to take chances that furnished to the\r\ncorrupt politician and the corrupt police officer their opportunities.\r\n\r\nThere was in New York City a strong sentiment in favor of honesty in\r\npolitics; there was also a strong sentiment in favor of opening the\r\nsaloons on Sundays; and, finally, there was a strong sentiment in favor\r\nof keeping the saloons closed on Sunday. Unfortunately, many of the men\r\nwho favored honest government nevertheless preferred keeping the saloons\r\nopen to having honest government; and many others among the men who\r\nfavored honest government put it second to keeping the saloons closed.\r\nMoreover, among the people who wished the law obeyed and the saloons\r\nclosed there were plenty who objected strongly to every step necessary\r\nto accomplish the result, although they also insisted that the result\r\nshould be accomplished.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the politicians found an incredible profit in using the law as\r\na club to keep the saloons in line; all except the biggest, the owners\r\nof which, or the owners of the breweries back of which, sat in the inner\r\ncouncils of Tammany, or controlled Tammany's allies in the Republican\r\norganization. The police used the partial and spasmodic enforcement\r\nof the law as a means of collecting blackmail. The result was that the\r\nofficers of the law, the politicians, and the saloon-keepers became\r\ninextricably tangled in a network of crime and connivance at crime. The\r\nmost powerful saloon-keepers controlled the politicians and the police,\r\nwhile the latter in turn terrorized and blackmailed all the other\r\nsaloon-keepers. It was not a case of non-enforcement of the law. The\r\nlaw was very actively enforced, but it was enforced with corrupt\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for men who have not been brought into contact with that\r\nside of political life which deals with the underworld to understand the\r\nbrazen openness with which this blackmailing of lawbreakers was carried\r\nout. A further very dark fact was that many of the men responsible for\r\nputting the law on the statute-books in order to please one element of\r\ntheir constituents, also connived at or even profited by the corrupt\r\nand partial non-enforcement of the law in order to please another set of\r\ntheir constituents, or to secure profit for themselves. The organ of the\r\nliquor-sellers at that time was the Wine and Spirit Gazette. The editor\r\nof this paper believed in selling liquor on Sunday, and felt that it was\r\nan outrage to forbid it. But he also felt that corruption and blackmail\r\nmade too big a price to pay for the partial non-enforcement of the law.\r\nHe made in his paper a statement, the correctness of which was never\r\nquestioned, which offers a startling commentary on New York politics of\r\nthat period. In this statement he recited the fact that the system of\r\nblackmail had been brought to such a state of perfection, and had become\r\nso oppressive to the liquor dealers themselves, that they communicated\r\nat length on the subject with Governor Hill (the State Democratic boss)\r\nand then with Mr. Croker (the city Democratic boss). Finally the matter\r\nwas formally taken up by a committee of the Central Association of\r\nLiquor Dealers in an interview they held with Mr. Martin, my Tammany\r\npredecessor as President of the police force. In matter-of-course way\r\nthe editor's statement continues: \"An agreement was made between the\r\nleaders of Tammany Hall and the liquor dealers according to which the\r\nmonthly blackmail paid to the force should be discontinued in return for\r\npolitical support.\" Not only did the big bosses, State and local, treat\r\nthis agreement, and the corruption to which it was due, as normal and\r\nproper, but they never even took the trouble to deny what had been done\r\nwhen it was made public. Tammany and the police, however, did not fully\r\nlive up to the agreement; and much discrimination of a very corrupt\r\nkind, and of a very exasperating kind to liquor-sellers who wished to be\r\nhonest, continued in connection with the enforcing of the law.\r\n\r\nIn short, the agreement was kept only with those who had \"pull.\" These\r\nmen with \"pull\" were benefited when their rivals were bullied and\r\nblackmailed by the police. The police, meanwhile, who had bought\r\nappointment or promotion, and the politicians back of them, extended the\r\nblackmailing to include about everything from the pushcart peddler and\r\nthe big or small merchant who wished to use the sidewalk illegally for\r\nhis goods, up to the keepers of the brothel, the gambling-house, and the\r\npolicy-shop. The total blackmail ran into millions of dollars. New York\r\nwas a wide-open town. The big bosses rolled in wealth, and the corrupt\r\npolicemen who ran the force lost all sense of decency and justice.\r\nNevertheless, I wish to insist on the fact that the honest men on the\r\npatrol posts, \"the men with the night-sticks,\" remained desirous to see\r\nhonesty obtain, although they were losing courage and hope.\r\n\r\nThis was the situation that confronted me when I came to Mulberry\r\nStreet. The saloon was the chief source of mischief. It was with the\r\nsaloon that I had to deal, and there was only one way to deal with\r\nit. That was to enforce the law. The howl that rose was deafening. The\r\nprofessional politicians raved. The yellow press surpassed themselves\r\nin clamor and mendacity. A favorite assertion was that I was enforcing\r\na \"blue\" law, an obsolete law that had never before been enforced. As\r\na matter of fact, I was only enforcing honestly a law that had hitherto\r\nbeen enforced dishonestly. There was very little increase in the number\r\nof arrests made for violating the Sunday law. Indeed, there were weeks\r\nwhen the number of arrests went down. The only difference was that\r\nthere was no protected class. Everybody was arrested alike, and I took\r\nespecial pains to see that there was no discrimination, and that the\r\nbig men and the men with political influence were treated like every one\r\nelse. The immediate effect was wholly good. I had been told that it\r\nwas not possible to close the saloons on Sunday and that I could\r\nnot succeed. However, I did succeed. The warden of Bellevue Hospital\r\nreported, two or three weeks after we had begun, that for the first time\r\nin its existence there had not been a case due to a drunken brawl in the\r\nhospital all Monday. The police courts gave the same testimony, while\r\nsavings banks recorded increased deposits and pawnshops hard times.\r\nThe most touching of all things was the fact that we received letters,\r\nliterally by the hundred, from mothers in tenement-houses who had never\r\nbeen allowed to take their children to the country in the wide-open\r\ndays, and who now found their husbands willing to take them and their\r\nfamilies for an outing on Sunday. Jake Riis and I spent one Sunday from\r\nmorning till night in the tenement districts, seeing for ourselves what\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\nDuring the two years that we were in office things never slipped back\r\nto anything like what they had been before. But we did not succeed\r\nin keeping them quite as highly keyed as during these first weeks. As\r\nregards the Sunday-closing law, this was partly because public sentiment\r\nwas not really with us. The people who had demanded honesty, but who\r\ndid not like to pay for it by the loss of illegal pleasure, joined the\r\nopenly dishonest in attacking us. Moreover, all kinds of ways of evading\r\nthe law were tried, and some of them were successful. The statute, for\r\ninstance, permitted any man to take liquor with meals. After two\r\nor three months a magistrate was found who decided judicially that\r\nseventeen beers and one pretzel made a meal--after which decision joy\r\nagain became unconfined in at least some of the saloons, and the yellow\r\npress gleefully announced that my \"tyranny\" had been curbed. But my\r\nprime object, that of stopping blackmail, was largely attained.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of incidents occurred in connection with this crusade. One of\r\nthem introduced me to a friend who remains a friend yet. His name was\r\nEdward J. Bourke. He was one of the men who entered the police force\r\nthrough our examinations shortly after I took office. I had summoned\r\ntwenty or thirty of the successful applicants to let me look over them;\r\nand as I walked into the hall, one of them, a well-set-up man, called\r\nout sharply to the others, \"Gangway,\" making them move to one side.\r\nI found he had served in the United States navy. The incident was\r\nsufficient to make me keep him in mind. A month later I was notified by\r\na police reporter, a very good fellow, that Bourke was in difficulties,\r\nand that he thought I had better look into the matter myself, as Bourke\r\nwas being accused by certain very influential men of grave misconduct in\r\nan arrest he had made the night before. Accordingly, I took the matter\r\nup personally. I found that on the new patrolman's beat the preceding\r\nnight--a new beat--there was a big saloon run by a man of great\r\ninfluence in political circles known as \"King\" Calahan. After midnight\r\nthe saloon was still running in full blast, and Bourke, stepping inside,\r\ntold Calahan to close up. It was at the time filled with \"friends of\r\npersonal liberty,\" as Governor Hill used at that time, in moments of\r\npathos, to term everybody who regarded as tyranny any restriction on the\r\nsale of liquor. Calahan's saloon had never before in its history been\r\nclosed, and to have a green cop tell him to close it seemed to him so\r\nincredible that he regarded it merely as a bad jest. On his next round\r\nBourke stepped in and repeated the order. Calahan felt that the jest\r\nhad gone too far, and by way of protest knocked Bourke down. This was\r\nan error of judgment on his part, for when Bourke arose he knocked down\r\nCalahan. The two then grappled and fell on the floor, while the \"friends\r\nof personal liberty\" danced around the fight and endeavored to stamp on\r\neverything they thought wasn't Calahan. However, Bourke, though pretty\r\nroughly handled, got his man and shut the saloon. When he appeared\r\nagainst the lawbreaker in court next day, he found the court-room\r\ncrowded with influential Tammany Hall politicians, backed by one or\r\ntwo Republican leaders of the same type; for Calahan was a baron of\r\nthe underworld, and both his feudal superiors and his feudal inferiors\r\ngathered to the rescue. His backers in court included a Congressman and\r\na State Senator, and so deep-rooted was the police belief in \"pull\"\r\nthat his own superiors had turned against Bourke and were preparing to\r\nsacrifice him. Just at this time I acted on the information given me by\r\nmy newspaper friend by starting in person for the court. The knowledge\r\nthat I knew what was going on, that I meant what I said, and that I\r\nintended to make the affair personal, was all that was necessary. Before\r\nI reached the court all effort to defend Calahan had promptly ceased,\r\nand Bourke had come forth triumphant. I immediately promoted him to\r\nroundsman. He is a captain now. He has been on the force ever since,\r\nsave that when the Spanish War came he obtained a holiday without pay\r\nfor six months and reentered the navy, serving as gun captain in one of\r\nthe gunboats, and doing his work, as was to be expected, in first-rate\r\nfashion, especially when under fire.\r\n\r\nLet me again say that when men tell me that the police are irredeemably\r\nbad I remember scores and hundreds of cases like this of Bourke, like\r\nthe case I have already mentioned of Raphael, like the other cases I\r\nhave given above.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to tell me that these men are bad. They are naturally\r\nfirst-rate men. There are no better men anywhere than the men of the\r\nNew York police force; and when they go bad it is because the system\r\nis wrong, and because they are not given the chance to do the good work\r\nthey can do and would rather do. I never coddled these men. I punished\r\nthem severely whenever I thought their conduct required it. All I did\r\nwas to try to be just; to reward them when they did well; in short, to\r\nact squarely by them. I believe that, as a whole, they liked me. When,\r\nin 1912, I ran for President on the Progressive ticket, I received a\r\nnumber of unsigned letters inclosing sums of money for the campaign. One\r\nof these inclosed twenty dollars. The writer, who did not give his\r\nname, said that he was a policeman, that I had once had him before me on\r\ncharges, and had fined him twenty dollars; that, as a matter of fact,\r\nhe had not committed the offense for which I fined him, but that the\r\nevidence was such that he did not wonder that I had been misled, and\r\nnever blamed me for it, because I had acted squarely and had given\r\nhonest and decent men a chance in the Police Department; and that now he\r\ninclosed a twenty-dollar bill, the amount of the fine inflicted on him\r\nso many years before. I have always wished I knew who the man was.\r\n\r\nThe disciplinary courts were very interesting. But it was\r\nextraordinarily difficult to get at the facts in the more complicated\r\ncases--as must always be true under similar circumstances; for\r\nordinarily it is necessary to back up the superior officer who makes\r\nthe charge, and yet it is always possible that this superior officer is\r\nconsciously or unconsciously biased against his subordinate.\r\n\r\nIn the courts the charges were sometimes brought by police officers and\r\nsometimes by private citizens. In the latter case we would get queer\r\ninsights into twilight phases of New York life. It was necessary to be\r\nalways on our guard. Often an accusation would be brought against the\r\npoliceman because he had been guilty of misconduct. Much more often the\r\naccusation merely meant that the officer had incurred animosity by doing\r\nhis duty. I remember one amusing case where the officer was wholly to\r\nblame but had acted in entire good faith.\r\n\r\nOne of the favorite and most demoralizing forms of gambling in New York\r\nwas policy-playing. The policy slips consisted of papers with three rows\r\nof figures written on them. The officer in question was a huge pithecoid\r\nlout of a creature, with a wooden face and a receding forehead, and his\r\naccuser whom he had arrested the preceding evening was a little grig\r\nof a red-headed man, obviously respectable, and almost incoherent with\r\nrage. The anger of the little red-headed man was but natural, for he had\r\njust come out from a night in the station-house. He had been arrested\r\nlate in the evening on suspicion that he was a policy-player, because of\r\nthe rows of figures on a piece of paper which he had held in his hand,\r\nand because at the time of his arrest he had just stepped into the\r\nentrance of the hall of a tenement-house in order to read by lamplight.\r\nThe paper was produced in evidence. There were the three rows of figures\r\nall right, but, as the accused explained, hopping up and down with rage\r\nand excitement, they were all of them the numbers of hymns. He was the\r\nsuperintendent of a small Sunday-school. He had written down the hymns\r\nfor several future services, one under the other, and on the way home\r\nwas stopping to look at them, under convenient lamp-posts, and finally\r\nby the light of the lamp in a tenement-house hallway; and it was this\r\nconduct which struck the sagacious man in uniform as \"suspicious.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the saddest features of police work is dealing with the social\r\nevil, with prostitutes and houses of ill fame. In so far as the law gave\r\nme power, I always treated the men taken in any raid on these houses\r\nprecisely as the women were treated. My experience brought me to the\r\nvery strong conviction that there ought not to be any toleration by law\r\nof the vice. I do not know of any method which will put a complete\r\nstop to the evil, but I do know certain things that ought to be done to\r\nminimize it. One of these is treating men and women on an exact equality\r\nfor the same act. Another is the establishment of night courts and of\r\nspecial commissions to deal with this special class of cases. Another\r\nis that suggested by the Rev. Charles Stelzle, of the Labor Temple--to\r\npublish conspicuously the name of the owner of any property used for\r\nimmoral purposes, after said owner had been notified of the use and has\r\nfailed to prevent it. Another is to prosecute the keepers and backers of\r\nbrothels, men and women, as relentlessly and punish them as severely as\r\npickpockets and common thieves. They should never be fined; they should\r\nbe imprisoned. As for the girls, the very young ones and first\r\noffenders should be put in the charge of probation officers or sent to\r\nreformatories, and the large percentage of feeble-minded girls and of\r\nincorrigible girls and women should be sent to institutions created for\r\nthem. We would thus remove from this hideous commerce the articles\r\nof commerce. Moreover, the Federal Government must in ever-increasing\r\nmeasure proceed against the degraded promoters of this commercialism,\r\nfor their activities are inter-State and the Nation can often deal with\r\nthem more effectively than the States; although, as public sentiment\r\nbecomes aroused, Nation, State, and municipality will all cooperate\r\ntowards the same end of rooting out the traffic. But the prime need is\r\nto raise the level of individual morality; and, moreover, to encourage\r\nearly marriages, the single standard of sex-morality, and a strict sense\r\nof reciprocal conjugal obligation. The women who preach late marriages\r\nare by just so much making it difficult to better the standard of\r\nchastity.\r\n\r\nAs regards the white slave traffic, the men engaged in it, and the women\r\ntoo, are far worse criminals than any ordinary murderers can be. For\r\nthem there is need of such a law as that recently adopted in England\r\nthrough the efforts of Arthur Lee, M.P., a law which includes whipping\r\nfor the male offenders. There are brutes so low, so infamous, so\r\ndegraded and bestial in their cruelty and brutality, that the only way\r\nto get at them is through their skins. Sentimentality on behalf of such\r\nmen is really almost as unhealthy and wicked as the criminality of the\r\nmen themselves. My experience is that there should be no toleration of\r\nany \"tenderloin\" or \"red light\" district, and that, above all, there\r\nshould be the most relentless war on commercialized vice. The men who\r\nprofit and make their living by the depravity and the awful misery\r\nof other human beings stand far below any ordinary criminals, and no\r\nmeasures taken against them can be too severe.\r\n\r\nAs for the wretched girls who follow the dreadful trade in question, a\r\ngood deal can be done by a change in economic conditions. This ought\r\nto be done. When girls are paid wages inadequate to keep them from\r\nstarvation, or to permit them to live decently, a certain proportion are\r\nforced by their economic misery into lives of vice. The employers and\r\nall others responsible for these conditions stand on a moral level not\r\nfar above the white slavers themselves. But it is a mistake to suppose\r\nthat either the correction of these economic conditions or the abolition\r\nof the white slave trade will wholly correct the evil or will even reach\r\nthe major part of it. The economic factor is very far from being the\r\nchief factor in inducing girls to go into this dreadful life. As with so\r\nmany other problems, while there must be governmental action, there must\r\nalso be strengthening of the average individual character in order to\r\nachieve the desired end. Even where economic conditions are bad, girls\r\nwho are both strong and pure will remain unaffected by temptations to\r\nwhich girls of weak character or lax standards readily yield. Any man\r\nwho knows the wide variation in the proportions of the different races\r\nand nationalities engaged in prostitution must come to the conclusion\r\nthat it is out of the question to treat economic conditions as the sole\r\nconditions or even as the chief conditions that determine this question.\r\nThere are certain races--the Irish are honorably conspicuous among\r\nthem--which, no matter what the economic pressure, furnish relatively\r\nfew inmates of houses of ill fame. I do not believe that the differences\r\nare due to permanent race characteristics; this is shown by the\r\nfact that the best settlement houses find that practically all their\r\n\"long-term graduates,\" so to speak, all the girls that come for a long\r\nperiod under their influence, no matter what their race or national\r\norigin, remain pure. In every race there are some naturally vicious\r\nindividuals and some weak individuals who readily succumb under economic\r\npressure. A girl who is lazy and hates hard work, a girl whose mind is\r\nrather feeble, and who is of \"subnormal intelligence,\" as the phrase now\r\ngoes, or a girl who craves cheap finery and vapid pleasure, is always\r\nin danger. A high ideal of personal purity is essential. Where the same\r\npressure under the same economic conditions has tenfold the effect\r\non one set of people that it has on another, it is evident that the\r\nquestion of moral standards is even more important than the question\r\nof economic standards, very important though this question is. It is\r\nimportant for us to remember that the girl ought to have the chance, not\r\nonly for the necessaries of life, but for innocent pleasure; and that\r\neven more than the man she must not be broken by overwork, by excessive\r\ntoil. Moreover, public opinion and the law should combine to hunt\r\ndown the \"flagrant man swine\" who himself hunts down poor or silly or\r\nunprotected girls. But we must not, in foolish sentimentality, excuse\r\nthe girl from her duty to keep herself pure. Our duty to achieve the\r\nsame moral level for the two sexes must be performed by raising the\r\nlevel for the man, not by lowering it for the woman; and the fact that\r\nsociety must recognize its duty in no shape or way relieves, not even\r\nto the smallest degree, the individual from doing his or her duty.\r\nSentimentality which grows maudlin on behalf of the willful prostitute\r\nis a curse; to confound her with the entrapped or coerced girl, the real\r\nwhite slave, is both foolish and wicked. There are evil women just as\r\nthere are evil men, naturally depraved girls just as there are naturally\r\ndepraved young men; and the right and wise thing, the just thing, to\r\nthem, and the generous thing to innocent girls and decent men, is to\r\nwage stern war against the evil creatures of both sexes.\r\n\r\nIn company with Jacob Riis, I did much work that was not connected with\r\nthe actual discipline of the force or indeed with the actual work of\r\nthe force. There was one thing which he and I abolished--police\r\nlodging-houses, which were simply tramp lodging-houses, and a fruitful\r\nencouragement to vagrancy. Those who read Mr. Riis's story of his own\r\nlife will remember the incidents that gave him from actual personal\r\nexperience his horror of these tramp lodging-houses. As member of the\r\nHealth Board I was brought into very close relations with the conditions\r\nof life in the tenement-house districts. Here again I used to visit the\r\ndifferent tenement-house regions, usually in company with Riis, to\r\nsee for myself what the conditions were. It was largely this personal\r\nexperience that enabled me while on the Health Board to struggle not\r\nonly zealously, but with reasonable efficiency and success, to improve\r\nconditions. We did our share in making forward strides in the matter of\r\nhousing the working people of the city with some regard to decency and\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\nThe midnight trips that Riis and I took enabled me to see what the\r\nPolice Department was doing, and also gave me personal insight into some\r\nof the problems of city life. It is one thing to listen in perfunctory\r\nfashion to tales of overcrowded tenements, and it is quite another\r\nactually to see what that overcrowding means, some hot summer night, by\r\neven a single inspection during the hours of darkness. There was a very\r\nhot spell one midsummer while I was Police Commissioner, and most of\r\neach night I spent walking through the tenement-house districts and\r\nvisiting police stations to see what was being done. It was a tragic\r\nweek. We did everything possible to alleviate the suffering. Much of it\r\nwas heartbreaking, especially the gasping misery of the little children\r\nand of the worn-out mothers. Every resource of the Health Department, of\r\nthe Police Department, and even the Fire Department (which flooded the\r\nhot streets) was taxed in the effort to render service. The heat killed\r\nsuch multitudes of horses that the means at our disposal for removing\r\nthe poor dead beasts proved quite inadequate, although every nerve was\r\nstrained to the limit. In consequence we received scores of complaints\r\nfrom persons before whose doors dead horses had remained, festering\r\nin the heat, for two or three days. One irascible man sent us furious\r\ndenunciations, until we were at last able to send a big dray to drag\r\naway the horse that lay dead before his shop door. The huge dray already\r\ncontained eleven other dead horses, and when it reached this particular\r\ndoor it broke down, and it was hours before it could be moved. The\r\nunfortunate man who had thus been cursed with a granted wish closed\r\nhis doors in despair and wrote us a final pathetic letter in which he\r\nrequested us to remove either the horses or his shop, he didn't care\r\nwhich.\r\n\r\nI have spoken before of my experience with the tenement-house cigar\r\nfactory law which the highest court of New York State declared\r\nunconstitutional. My experience in the Police Department taught me\r\nthat not a few of the worst tenement-houses were owned by wealthy\r\nindividuals, who hired the best and most expensive lawyers to persuade\r\nthe courts that it was \"unconstitutional\" to insist on the betterment of\r\nconditions. These business men and lawyers were very adroit in using\r\na word with fine and noble associations to cloak their opposition to\r\nvitally necessary movements for industrial fair play and decency. They\r\nmade it evident that they valued the Constitution, not as a help\r\nto righteousness, but as a means for thwarting movements against\r\nunrighteousness. After my experience with them I became more set than\r\never in my distrust of those men, whether business men or lawyers,\r\njudges, legislators, or executive officers, who seek to make of the\r\nConstitution a fetich for the prevention of the work of social reform,\r\nfor the prevention of work in the interest of those men, women, and\r\nchildren on whose behalf we should be at liberty to employ freely every\r\ngovernmental agency.\r\n\r\nOccasionally during the two years we had to put a stop to riotous\r\nviolence, and now and then on these occasions some of the labor union\r\nleaders protested against the actions of the police. By this time I was\r\nbecoming a strong believer in labor unions, a strong believer in the\r\nrights of labor. For that very reason I was all the more bound to see\r\nthat lawlessness and disorder were put down, and that no rioter was\r\npermitted to masquerade under the guise of being a friend of labor or a\r\nsympathizer with labor. I was scrupulous to see that the labor men had\r\nfair play; that, for instance, they were allowed to picket just so far\r\nas under the law picketing could be permitted, so that the strikers had\r\nample opportunity peacefully to persuade other labor men not to take\r\ntheir places. But I made it clearly and definitely understood that under\r\nno circumstances would I permit violence or fail to insist upon the\r\nkeeping of order. If there were wrongs, I would join with a full heart\r\nin striving to have them corrected. But where there was violence\r\nall other questions had to drop until order was restored. This is a\r\ndemocracy, and the people have the power, if they choose to exercise\r\nit, to make conditions as they ought to be made, and to do this strictly\r\nwithin the law; and therefore the first duty of the true democrat, of\r\nthe man really loyal to the principles of popular government, is to see\r\nthat law is enforced and order upheld. It was a peculiar gratification\r\nto me that so many of the labor leaders with whom I was thrown in\r\ncontact grew cordially to accept this view. When I left the Department,\r\nseveral called upon me to say how sorry they were that I was not to\r\ncontinue in office. One, the Secretary of the Journeyman Bakers' and\r\nConfectioners' International Union, Henry Weismann, wrote me expressing\r\nhis regret that I was going, and his appreciation as a citizen of what\r\nI had done as Police Commissioner; he added: \"I am particularly\r\ngrateful for your liberal attitude toward organized labor, your cordial\r\nchampionship of those speaking in behalf of the toilers, and your\r\nevident desire to do the right thing as you saw it at whatever cost.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the letters I received on leaving the Department were from\r\nunexpected sources. Mr. E. L. Godkin, an editor who in international\r\nmatters was not a patriotic man, wrote protesting against my taking the\r\nAssistant-Secretaryship of the Navy, and adding: \"I have a concern, as\r\nthe Quakers say, to put on record my earnest belief that in New York you\r\nare doing the greatest work of which any American to-day is capable,\r\nand exhibiting to the young men of the country the spectacle of a very\r\nimportant office administered by a man of high character in the most\r\nefficient way amid a thousand difficulties. As a lesson in politics I\r\ncannot think of anything more instructive.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the same time I had a letter from Mr. (afterwards Ambassador)\r\nJames Bryce, also expressing regret that I was leaving the Police\r\nDepartment, but naturally with much more appreciation of the work that\r\nwas to be done in the Navy Department. This letter I quote, with his\r\npermission, because it conveys a lesson to those who are inclined always\r\nto think that the conditions of the present time are very bad. It was\r\nwritten July 7, 1897. Mr. Bryce spoke of the possibility of coming to\r\nAmerica in a month or so, and continued: \"I hope I may have a chance\r\nof seeing you if I do get over, and of drawing some comfort from you\r\nas regards your political phenomena, which, so far as I can gather\r\nfrom those of your countrymen I have lately seen, furnish some good\r\nopportunities for a persistent optimist like myself to show that he is\r\nnot to be lightly discouraged. Don't suppose that things are specially\r\n'nice,' as a lady would say, in Europe either. They are not.\" Mr. Bryce\r\nwas a very friendly and extraordinary competent observer of things\r\nAmerican; and there was this distinct note of discouragement about our\r\nfuture in the intimate letter he was thus sending. Yet this was at the\r\nvery time when the United States was entering on a dozen years during\r\nwhich our people accomplished more good, and came nearer realizing the\r\npossibilities of a great, free, and conscientious democracy, than during\r\nany other dozen years in our history, save only the years of Lincoln's\r\nPresidency and the period during which the Nation was founded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE WAR OF AMERICA THE UNREADY\r\n\r\nI suppose the United States will always be unready for war, and\r\nin consequence will always be exposed to great expense, and to the\r\npossibility of the gravest calamity, when the Nation goes to war. This\r\nis no new thing. Americans learn only from catastrophes and not from\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThere would have been no war in 1812 if, in the previous decade,\r\nAmerica, instead of announcing that \"peace was her passion,\" instead of\r\nacting on the theory that unpreparedness averts war, had been willing to\r\ngo to the expense of providing a fleet of a score of ships of the line.\r\nHowever, in that case, doubtless the very men who in the actual\r\nevent deplored the loss of life and waste of capital which their own\r\nsupineness had brought about would have loudly inveighed against the\r\n\"excessive and improper cost of armaments\"; so it all came to about the\r\nsame thing in the end.\r\n\r\nThere is no more thoroughgoing international Mrs. Gummidge, and no\r\nmore utterly useless and often utterly mischievous citizen, than the\r\npeace-at-any-price, universal-arbitration type of being, who is always\r\ncomplaining either about war or else about the cost of the armaments\r\nwhich act as the insurance against war. There is every reason why\r\nwe should try to limit the cost of armaments, as these tend to grow\r\nexcessive, but there is also every reason to remember that in the\r\npresent stage of civilization a proper armament is the surest guarantee\r\nof peace--and is the only guarantee that war, if it does come, will not\r\nmean irreparable and overwhelming disaster.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1897 President McKinley appointed me Assistant\r\nSecretary of the Navy. I owed the appointment chiefly to the efforts of\r\nSenator H. C. Lodge of Massachusetts, who doubtless was actuated mainly\r\nby his long and close friendship for me, but also--I like to believe--by\r\nhis keen interest in the navy. The first book I had ever published,\r\nfifteen years previously, was \"The History of the Naval War of 1812\";\r\nand I have always taken the interest in the navy which every good\r\nAmerican ought to take. At the time I wrote the book, in the early\r\neighties, the navy had reached its nadir, and we were then utterly\r\nincompetent to fight Spain or any other power that had a navy at all.\r\nShortly afterwards we began timidly and hesitatingly to build up\r\na fleet. It is amusing to recall the roundabout steps we took to\r\naccomplish our purpose. In the reaction after the colossal struggle of\r\nthe Civil War our strongest and most capable men had thrown their whole\r\nenergy into business, into money-making, into the development, and above\r\nall the exploitation and exhaustion at the most rapid rate possible, of\r\nour natural resources--mines, forests, soil, and rivers. These men were\r\nnot weak men, but they permitted themselves to grow shortsighted\r\nand selfish; and while many of them down at the bottom possessed the\r\nfundamental virtues, including the fighting virtues, others were purely\r\nof the glorified huckster or glorified pawnbroker type--which when\r\ndeveloped to the exclusion of everything else makes about as poor a\r\nnational type as the world has seen. This unadulterated huckster or\r\npawnbroker type is rarely keenly sympathetic in matters of social and\r\nindustrial justice, and is usually physically timid and likes to cover\r\nan unworthy fear of the most just war under high-sounding names.\r\n\r\nIt was reinforced by the large mollycoddle vote--the people who are soft\r\nphysically and morally, or who have a twist in them which makes them\r\nacidly cantankerous and unpleasant as long as they can be so with\r\nsafety to their bodies. In addition there are the good people with no\r\nimagination and no foresight, who think war will not come, but that if\r\nit does come armies and navies can be improvised--a very large element,\r\ntypified by a Senator I knew personally who, in a public speech, in\r\nanswer to a question as to what we would do if America were suddenly\r\nassailed by a first-class military power, answered that \"we would build\r\na battle-ship in every creek.\" Then, among the wise and high-minded\r\npeople who in self-respecting and genuine fashion strive earnestly\r\nfor peace, there are the foolish fanatics always to be found in such a\r\nmovement and always discrediting it--the men who form the lunatic fringe\r\nin all reform movements.\r\n\r\nAll these elements taken together made a body of public opinion so\r\nimportant during the decades immediately succeeding the Civil War as to\r\nput a stop to any serious effort to keep the Nation in a condition of\r\nreasonable military preparedness. The representatives of this opinion\r\nthen voted just as they now do when they vote against battle-ships or\r\nagainst fortifying the Panama Canal. It would have been bad enough if\r\nwe had been content to be weak, and, in view of our weakness, not to\r\nbluster. But we were not content with such a policy. We wished to enjoy\r\nthe incompatible luxuries of an unbridled tongue and an unready hand.\r\nThere was a very large element which was ignorant of our military\r\nweakness, or, naturally enough, unable to understand it; and another\r\nlarge element which liked to please its own vanity by listening to\r\noffensive talk about foreign nations. Accordingly, too many of our\r\npoliticians, especially in Congress, found that the cheap and easy thing\r\nto do was to please the foolish peace people by keeping us weak, and to\r\nplease the foolish violent people by passing denunciatory resolutions\r\nabout international matters--resolutions which would have been\r\nimproper even if we had been strong. Their idea was to please both the\r\nmollycoddle vote and the vote of the international tail-twisters by\r\nupholding, with pretended ardor and mean intelligence, a National policy\r\nof peace with insult.\r\n\r\nI abhor unjust war. I abhor injustice and bullying by the strong at\r\nthe expense of the weak, whether among nations or individuals. I abhor\r\nviolence and bloodshed. I believe that war should never be resorted to\r\nwhen, or so long as, it is honorably possible to avoid it. I respect all\r\nmen and women who from high motives and with sanity and self-respect do\r\nall they can to avert war. I advocate preparation for war in order\r\nto avert war; and I should never advocate war unless it were the only\r\nalternative to dishonor. I describe the folly of which so many of our\r\npeople were formerly guilty, in order that we may in our own day be on\r\nour guard against similar folly.\r\n\r\nWe did not at the time of which I write take our foreign duties\r\nseriously, and as we combined bluster in speech with refusal to make\r\nany preparation whatsoever for action, we were not taken seriously in\r\nreturn. Gradually a slight change for the better occurred, the writings\r\nof Captain Mahan playing no small part therein. We built some modern\r\ncruisers to start with; the people who felt that battle-ships were\r\nwicked compromising with their misguided consciences by saying that the\r\ncruisers could be used \"to protect our commerce\"--which they could not\r\nbe, unless they had battle-ships to back them. Then we attempted to\r\nbuild more powerful fighting vessels, and as there was a section of\r\nthe public which regarded battle-ships as possessing a name immorally\r\nsuggestive of violence, we compromised by calling the new ships armored\r\ncruisers, and making them combine with exquisite nicety all the defects\r\nand none of the virtues of both types. Then we got to the point of\r\nbuilding battle-ships. But there still remained a public opinion, as old\r\nas the time of Jefferson, which thought that in the event of war all\r\nour problem ought to be one of coast defense, that we should do\r\nnothing except repel attack; an attitude about as sensible as that of a\r\nprize-fighter who expected to win by merely parrying instead of hitting.\r\nTo meet the susceptibilities of this large class of well-meaning people,\r\nwe provided for the battle-ships under the name of \"coast defense\r\nbattle-ships\"; meaning thereby that we did not make them quite as\r\nseaworthy as they ought to have been, or with quite as much coal\r\ncapacity as they ought to have had. Then we decided to build real\r\nbattle-ships. But there still remained a lingering remnant of public\r\nopinion that clung to the coast defense theory, and we met this\r\nin beautiful fashion by providing for \"sea-going coast defense\r\nbattle-ships\"--the fact that the name was a contradiction in terms being\r\nof very small consequence compared to the fact that we did thereby get\r\nreal battle-ships.\r\n\r\nOur men had to be trained to handle the ships singly and in fleet\r\nformation, and they had to be trained to use the new weapons of\r\nprecision with which the ships were armed. Not a few of the older\r\nofficers, kept in the service under our foolish rule of pure seniority\r\npromotion, were not competent for the task; but a proportion of the\r\nolder officers were excellent, and this was true of almost all the\r\nyounger officers. They were naturally first-class men, trained in the\r\nadmirable naval school at Annapolis. They were overjoyed that at last\r\nthey were given proper instruments to work with, and they speedily grew\r\nto handle these ships individually in the best fashion. They were fast\r\nlearning to handle them in squadron and fleet formation; but when the\r\nwar with Spain broke out, they had as yet hardly grasped the principles\r\nof modern scientific naval gunnery.\r\n\r\nSoon after I began work as Assistant Secretary of the Navy I became\r\nconvinced that the war would come. The revolt in Cuba had dragged its\r\nweary length until conditions in the island had become so dreadful as to\r\nbe a standing disgrace to us for permitting them to exist. There is much\r\nthat I sincerely admire about the Spanish character; and there are few\r\nmen for whom I have felt greater respect than for certain gentlemen of\r\nSpain whom I have known. But Spain attempted to govern her colonies on\r\narchaic principles which rendered her control of them incompatible with\r\nthe advance of humanity and intolerable to the conscience of mankind.\r\nIn 1898 the so-called war in Cuba had dragged along for years with\r\nunspeakable horror, degradation, and misery. It was not \"war\" at all,\r\nbut murderous oppression. Cuba was devastated.\r\n\r\nDuring those years, while we continued at \"peace,\" several hundred times\r\nas many lives were lost, lives of men, women, and children, as were lost\r\nduring the three months' \"war\" which put an end to this slaughter and\r\nopened a career of peaceful progress to the Cubans. Yet there were\r\nmisguided professional philanthropists who cared so much more for names\r\nthan for facts that they preferred a \"peace\" of continuous murder to\r\na \"war\" which stopped the murder and brought real peace. Spain's\r\nhumiliation was certain, anyhow; indeed, it was more certain without\r\nwar than with it, for she could not permanently keep the island, and she\r\nminded yielding to the Cubans more than yielding to us. Our own direct\r\ninterests were great, because of the Cuban tobacco and sugar, and\r\nespecially because of Cuba's relation to the projected Isthmian Canal.\r\nBut even greater were our interests from the standpoint of humanity.\r\nCuba was at our very doors. It was a dreadful thing for us to sit\r\nsupinely and watch her death agony. It was our duty, even more from\r\nthe standpoint of National honor than from the standpoint of National\r\ninterest, to stop the devastation and destruction. Because of these\r\nconsiderations I favored war; and to-day, when in retrospect it is\r\neasier to see things clearly, there are few humane and honorable men who\r\ndo not believe that the war was both just and necessary.\r\n\r\nThe big financiers and the men generally who were susceptible to touch\r\non the money nerve, and who cared nothing for National honor if it\r\nconflicted even temporarily with business prosperity, were against\r\nthe war. The more fatuous type of philanthropist agreed with them. The\r\nnewspapers controlled by, or run in the interests of, these two classes\r\ndeprecated war, and did everything in their power to prevent any\r\npreparation for war. As a whole the people in Congress were at that time\r\n(and are now) a shortsighted set as regards international matters. There\r\nwere a few men, Senators Cushman K. Davis,[*] for instance, and John\r\nMorgan, who did look ahead; and Senator H. C. Lodge, who throughout his\r\nquarter of a century of service in the Senate and House has ever stood\r\nforemost among those who uphold with farsighted fearlessness and strict\r\njustice to others our national honor and interest; but most of the\r\nCongressmen were content to follow the worst of all possible courses,\r\nthat is, to pass resolutions which made war more likely, and yet to\r\ndecline to take measures which would enable us to meet the war if it did\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n     [*] In a letter written me just before I became Assistant\r\n     Secretary, Senator Davis unburdened his mind about one of\r\n     the foolish \"peace\" proposals of that period; his letter\r\n     running in part: \"I left the Senate Chamber about three\r\n     o'clock this afternoon when there was going on a deal of\r\n     mowing and chattering over the treaty by which the United\r\n     States is to be bound to arbitrate its sovereign\r\n          functions--for policies are matters of sovereignty. . . .\r\n          The\r\n     aberrations of the social movement are neither progress nor\r\n     retrogression. They represent merely a local and temporary\r\n     sagging of the line of the great orbit. Tennyson knew this\r\n     when he wrote that fine and noble 'Maud.' I often read it,\r\n     for to do so does me good.\" After quoting one of Poe's\r\n     stories the letter continues: \"The world will come out all\r\n     right. Let him who believes in the decline of the military\r\n     spirit observe the boys of a common school during the recess\r\n     or the noon hour. Of course when American patriotism speaks\r\n     out from its rank and file and demands action or expression,\r\n     and when, thereupon, the 'business man,' so called, places\r\n     his hand on his stack of reds as if he feared a policeman\r\n     were about to disturb the game, and protests until American\r\n     patriotism ceases to continue to speak as it had started to\r\n     do--why, you and I get mad, and I swear. I hope you will be\r\n     with us here after March 4. We can then pass judgment\r\n     together on the things we don't like, and together indulge\r\n     in hopes that I believe are prophetic.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, in the Navy Department we were able to do a good deal, thanks\r\nto the energy and ability of some of the bureau chiefs, and to the\r\ngeneral good tone of the service. I soon found my natural friends and\r\nallies in such men as Evans, Taylor, Sampson, Wainwright, Brownson,\r\nSchroeder, Bradford, Cowles, Cameron, Winslow, O'Neil, and others like\r\nthem. I used all the power there was in my office to aid these men in\r\ngetting the material ready. I also tried to gather from every source\r\ninformation as to who the best men were to occupy the fighting\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nSound naval opinion was overwhelmingly in favor of Dewey to command\r\none squadron. I was already watching him, for I had been struck by an\r\nincident in his past career. It was at a time when there was threat of\r\ntrouble with Chile. Dewey was off the Argentine, and was told to get\r\nready to move to the other coast of South America. If the move became\r\nnecessary, he would have to have coal, and yet if he did not make the\r\nmove, the coal would not be needed. In such a case a man afraid of\r\nresponsibility always acts rigidly by the regulations and communicates\r\nwith the Department at home to get authority for everything he does;\r\nand therefore he usually accomplishes nothing whatever, but is able to\r\nsatisfy all individuals with red-tape minds by triumphantly pointing out\r\nhis compliance with the regulations. In a crisis, the man worth his\r\nsalt is the man who meets the needs of the situation in whatever way\r\nis necessary. Dewey purchased the coal and was ready to move at once if\r\nneed arose. The affair blew over; the need to move did not occur; and\r\nfor some time there seemed to be a chance that Dewey would get into\r\ntrouble over having purchased the coal, for our people are like\r\nalmost all other peoples in requiring responsible officers under such\r\nconditions to decide at their own personal peril, no matter which course\r\nthey follow. However, the people higher up ultimately stood by Dewey.\r\n\r\nThe incident made me feel that here was a man who could be relied upon\r\nto prepare in advance, and to act promptly, fearlessly, and on his own\r\nresponsibility when the emergency arose. Accordingly I did my best to\r\nget him put in command of the Asiatic fleet, the fleet where it was most\r\nessential to have a man who would act without referring things back\r\nto the home authorities. An officer senior to him, of the respectable\r\ncommonplace type, was being pushed by certain politicians who I knew had\r\ninfluence with the Navy Department and with the President. I would have\r\npreferred to see Dewey get the appointment without appealing to any\r\npolitician at all. But while this was my preference, the essential thing\r\nwas to get him the appointment. For a naval officer to bring pressure to\r\nget himself a soft and easy place is unpardonable; but a large leniency\r\nshould be observed toward the man who uses influence only to get himself\r\na place in the picture near the flashing of the guns. There was a\r\nSenator, Proctor of Vermont, who I knew was close to McKinley, and who\r\nwas very ardent for the war, and desirous to have it fought in the\r\nmost efficient fashion. I suggested to Dewey that he should enlist the\r\nservices of Senator Proctor, which was accordingly done. In a fortunate\r\nhour for the Nation, Dewey was given command of the Asiatic squadron.\r\n\r\nWhen the Maine was blown up in Havana Harbor, war became inevitable.\r\nA number of the peace-at-any-price men of course promptly assumed the\r\nposition that she had blown herself up; but investigation showed that\r\nthe explosion was from outside. And, in any event, it would have been\r\nimpossible to prevent war. The enlisted men of the navy, who often grew\r\nbored to the point of desertion in peace, became keyed up to a high\r\npitch of efficiency, and crowds of fine young fellows, from the interior\r\nas well as from the seacoast, thronged to enlist. The navy officers\r\nshowed alert ability and unwearied industry in getting things ready.\r\nThere was one deficiency, however, which there was no time to remedy,\r\nand of the very existence of which, strange to say, most of our best men\r\nwere ignorant. Our navy had no idea how low our standard of marksmanship\r\nwas. We had not realized that the modern battle-ship had become such\r\na complicated piece of mechanism that the old methods of training in\r\nmarksmanship were as obsolete as the old muzzle-loading broadside guns\r\nthemselves. Almost the only man in the navy who fully realized this\r\nwas our naval attache at Paris, Lieutenant Sims. He wrote letter after\r\nletter pointing out how frightfully backward we were in marksmanship.\r\nI was much impressed by his letters; but Wainwright was about the only\r\nother man who was. And as Sims proved to be mistaken in his belief that\r\nthe French had taught the Spaniards how to shoot, and as the Spaniards\r\nproved to be much worse even than we were, in the service generally Sims\r\nwas treated as an alarmist. But although I at first partly acquiesced in\r\nthis view, I grew uneasy when I studied the small proportion of hits to\r\nshots made by our vessels in battle. When I was President I took up the\r\nmatter, and speedily became convinced that we needed to revolutionize\r\nour whole training in marksmanship. Sims was given the lead in\r\norganizing and introducing the new system; and to him more than to any\r\nother one man was due the astonishing progress made by our fleet in this\r\nrespect, a progress which made the fleet, gun for gun, at least three\r\ntimes as effective, in point of fighting efficiency, in 1908, as it was\r\nin 1902. The shots that hit are the shots that count!\r\n\r\nLike the people, the Government was for a long time unwilling to prepare\r\nfor war, because so many honest but misguided men believed that the\r\npreparation itself tended to bring on the war. I did not in the least\r\nshare this feeling, and whenever I was left as Acting Secretary I did\r\neverything in my power to put us in readiness. I knew that in the event\r\nof war Dewey could be slipped like a wolf-hound from a leash; I was sure\r\nthat if he were given half a chance he would strike instantly and with\r\ntelling effect; and I made up my mind that all I could do to give him\r\nthat half-chance should be done. I was in the closest touch with Senator\r\nLodge throughout this period, and either consulted him about or notified\r\nhim of all the moves I was taking. By the end of February I felt it was\r\nvital to send Dewey (as well as each of our other commanders who\r\nwere not in home waters) instructions that would enable him to be in\r\nreadiness for immediate action. On the afternoon of Saturday, February\r\n25, when I was Acting Secretary, Lodge called on me just as I was\r\npreparing the order, which (as it was addressed to a man of the right\r\nstamp) was of much importance to the subsequent operations. Admiral\r\nDewey speaks of the incident as follows, in his autobiography:\r\n\r\n\"The first real step [as regards active naval preparations] was taken\r\non February 25, when telegraphic instructions were sent to the Asiatic,\r\nEuropean, and South Atlantic squadrons to rendezvous at certain\r\nconvenient points where, should war break out, they would be most\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n\"The message to the Asiatic squadron bore the signature of that\r\nAssistant Secretary who had seized the opportunity while Acting\r\nSecretary to hasten preparations for a conflict which was inevitable. As\r\nMr. Roosevelt reasoned, precautions for readiness would cost little in\r\ntime of peace, and yet would be invaluable in case of war. His cablegram\r\nwas as follows:\r\n\r\n\"'Washington, February 25, '98.\r\n\r\n\"'_Dewey, Hong Kong_:\r\n\r\n\"'Order the squadron, except the Monocacy, to Hong Kong. Keep full of\r\ncoal. In the event of declaration of war Spain, your duty will be to\r\nsee that the Spanish squadron does not leave the Asiatic coast, and then\r\noffensive operations in Philippine Islands. Keep Olympia until further\r\norders.\r\n\r\n\"'ROOSEVELT.'\r\n\r\n\"(The reference to keeping the Olympia until further orders was due to\r\nthe fact that I had been notified that she would soon be recalled to the\r\nUnited States.)\"\r\n\r\nAll that was needed with Dewey was to give him the chance to get ready,\r\nand then to strike, without being hampered by orders from those not on\r\nthe ground. Success in war depends very largely upon choosing a man fit\r\nto exercise such powers, and then giving him the powers.\r\n\r\nIt would be instructive to remember, if only we were willing to do so,\r\nthe fairly comic panic which swept in waves over our seacoast, first\r\nwhen it became evident that war was about to be declared, and then when\r\nit was declared. The public waked up to the sufficiently obvious fact\r\nthat the Government was in its usual state--perennial unreadiness for\r\nwar. Thereupon the people of the seaboard district passed at one bound\r\nfrom unreasoning confidence that war never could come to unreasoning\r\nfear as to what might happen now that it had come. That acute\r\nphilosopher Mr. Dooley proclaimed that in the Spanish War we were in a\r\ndream, but that the Spaniards were in a trance. This just about summed\r\nup the facts. Our people had for decades scoffed at the thought of\r\nmaking ready for possible war. Now, when it was too late, they not\r\nonly backed every measure, wise and unwise, that offered a chance of\r\nsupplying a need that ought to have been met before, but they also fell\r\ninto a condition of panic apprehension as to what the foe might do.\r\n\r\nFor years we had been saying, just as any number of our people now say,\r\nthat no nation would venture to attack us. Then when we did go to war\r\nwith an exceedingly feeble nation, we, for the time being, rushed to the\r\nother extreme of feeling, and attributed to this feeble nation plans of\r\noffensive warfare which it never dreamed of making, and which, if\r\nmade, it would have been wholly unable to execute. Some of my readers\r\ndoubtless remember the sinister intentions and unlimited potentialities\r\nfor destruction with which the fertile imagination of the yellow press\r\nendowed the armored cruiser Viscaya when she appeared in American waters\r\njust before war was declared. The state of nervousness along much of\r\nthe seacoast was funny in view of the lack of foundation for it; but\r\nit offered food for serious thought as to what would happen if we ever\r\nbecame engaged with a serious foe.\r\n\r\nThe Governor of one State actually announced that he would not permit\r\nthe National Guard of that State to leave its borders, the idea being to\r\nretain it against a possible Spanish invasion. So many of the business\r\nmen of the city of Boston took their securities inland to Worcester that\r\nthe safe deposit companies of Worcester proved unable to take care of\r\nthem. In my own neighborhood on Long Island clauses were gravely put\r\ninto leases to the effect that if the property were destroyed by the\r\nSpaniards the lease should lapse. As Assistant Secretary of the Navy I\r\nhad every conceivable impossible request made to me. Members of Congress\r\nwho had actively opposed building any navy came clamorously around to\r\nask each for a ship for some special purpose of protection connected\r\nwith his district. It seems incredible, but it is true, that not only\r\nthese Congressmen but the Chambers of Commerce and Boards of Trade of\r\ndifferent coast cities all lost their heads for the time being, and\r\nraised a deafening clamor and brought every species of pressure to bear\r\non the Administration to get it to adopt the one most fatal course--that\r\nis, to distribute the navy, ship by ship, at all kinds of points and in\r\nall kinds of ports with the idea of protecting everything everywhere,\r\nand thereby rendering it absolutely certain that even the Spanish fleet,\r\npoor though it was, would be able to pick up our own navy ship by ship\r\nin detail. One Congressman besought me for a ship to protect Jekyll\r\nIsland, off the coast of Georgia, an island which derived its\r\nsole consequence because it contained the winter homes of certain\r\nmillionaires. A lady whose husband occupied a very influential position,\r\nand who was normally a most admirable and sensible woman, came to insist\r\nthat a ship should be anchored off a huge seaside hotel because she had\r\na house in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThere were many such instances. One stood out above the others. A\r\ncertain seaboard State contained in its Congressional delegation one of\r\nthe most influential men in the Senate, and one of the most influential\r\nmen in the lower house. These two men had been worse than lukewarm about\r\nbuilding up the navy, and had scoffed at the idea of there ever being\r\nany danger from any foreign power. With the advent of war the feelings\r\nof their constituents, and therefore their own feelings, suffered an\r\nimmediate change, and they demanded that a ship be anchored in the\r\nharbor of their city as a protection. Getting no comfort from me, they\r\nwent \"higher up,\" and became a kind of permanent committee in attendance\r\nupon the President. They were very influential men in the Houses, with\r\nwhom it was important for the Administration to keep on good terms; and,\r\nmoreover, they possessed a pertinacity as great as the widow who won her\r\ncase from the unjust judge. Finally the President gave in and notified\r\nme to see that a ship was sent to the city in question. I was bound\r\nthat, as long as a ship had to be sent, it should not be a ship worth\r\nanything. Accordingly a Civil War Monitor, with one smooth-bore gun,\r\nmanaged by a crew of about twenty-one naval militia, was sent to the\r\ncity in question, under convoy of a tug. It was a hazardous trip for the\r\nunfortunate naval militiamen, but it was safely accomplished; and joy\r\nand peace descended upon the Senator and the Congressman, and upon the\r\nPresident whom they had jointly harassed. Incidentally, the fact that\r\nthe protecting war-vessel would not have been a formidable foe to\r\nany antagonists of much more modern construction than the galleys of\r\nAlcibiades seemed to disturb nobody.\r\n\r\nThis was one side of the picture. The other side was that the crisis at\r\nonce brought to the front any amount of latent fighting strength. There\r\nwere plenty of Congressmen who showed cool-headed wisdom and resolution.\r\nThe plain people, the men and women back of the persons who lost their\r\nheads, set seriously to work to see that we did whatever was necessary,\r\nand made the job a thorough one. The young men swarmed to enlist. In\r\ntime of peace it had been difficult to fill the scanty regular army and\r\nnavy, and there were innumerable desertions; now the ships and regiments\r\nwere over-enlisted, and so many deserters returned in order to fight\r\nthat it became difficult to decide what to do with them. England, and\r\nto a less degree Japan, were friendly. The great powers of Continental\r\nEurope were all unfriendly. They jeered at our ships and men, and with\r\nfatuous partisanship insisted that the Spaniards would prove too much\r\nfor our \"mercenaries\" because we were a commercial people of low ideals\r\nwho could not fight, while the men whom we attempted to hire for that\r\npurpose were certain to run on the day of battle.\r\n\r\nAmong my friends was the then Army Surgeon Leonard Wood. He was a\r\nsurgeon. Not having an income, he had to earn his own living. He had\r\ngone through the Harvard Medical School, and had then joined the army\r\nin the Southwest as a contract doctor. He had every physical, moral,\r\nand mental quality which fitted him for a soldier's life and for\r\nthe exercise of command. In the inconceivably wearing and harassing\r\ncampaigns against the Apaches he had served nominally as a surgeon,\r\nreally in command of troops, on more than one expedition. He was as\r\nanxious as I was that if there were war we should both have our part in\r\nit. I had always felt that if there were a serious war I wished to be in\r\na position to explain to my children why I did take part in it, and not\r\nwhy I did not take part in it. Moreover, I had very deeply felt that it\r\nwas our duty to free Cuba, and I had publicly expressed this feeling;\r\nand when a man takes such a position, he ought to be willing to make his\r\nwords good by his deeds unless there is some very strong reason to the\r\ncontrary. He should pay with his body.\r\n\r\nAs soon as war was upon us, Wood and I began to try for a chance to\r\ngo to the front. Congress had authorized the raising of three National\r\nVolunteer Cavalry regiments, wholly apart from the State contingents.\r\nSecretary Alger of the War Department was fond of me personally, and\r\nWood was his family doctor. Alger had been a gallant soldier in the\r\nCivil War, and was almost the only member of the Administration who felt\r\nall along that we would have to go to war with Spain over Cuba. He liked\r\nmy attitude in the matter, and because of his remembrance of his\r\nown experiences he sympathized with my desire to go to the front.\r\nAccordingly he offered me the command of one of the regiments. I told\r\nhim that after six weeks' service in the field I would feel competent to\r\nhandle the regiment, but that I would not know how to equip it or how\r\nto get it into the first action; but that Wood was entirely competent\r\nat once to take command, and that if he would make Wood colonel I would\r\naccept the lieutenant-colonelcy. General Alger thought this an act of\r\nfoolish self-abnegation on my part--instead of its being, what it\r\nwas, the wisest act I could have performed. He told me to accept the\r\ncolonelcy, and that he would make Wood lieutenant-colonel, and that Wood\r\nwould do the work anyway; but I answered that I did not wish to rise on\r\nany man's shoulders; that I hoped to be given every chance that my deeds\r\nand abilities warranted; but that I did not wish what I did not earn,\r\nand that above all I did not wish to hold any position where any one\r\nelse did the work. He laughed at me a little and said I was foolish, but\r\nI do not think he really minded, and he promised to do as I wished. True\r\nto his word, he secured the appointment of Wood as colonel and of myself\r\nas lieutenant-colonel of the First United States Volunteer Cavalry. This\r\nwas soon nicknamed, both by the public and by the rest of the army,\r\nthe Rough Riders, doubtless because the bulk of the men were from the\r\nSouthwestern ranch country and were skilled in the wild horsemanship of\r\nthe great plains.\r\n\r\nWood instantly began the work of raising the regiment. He first\r\nassembled several old non-commissioned officers of experience, put them\r\nin office, and gave them blanks for requisitions for the full equipment\r\nof a cavalry regiment. He selected San Antonio as the gathering-place,\r\nas it was in a good horse country, near the Gulf from some port on which\r\nwe would have to embark, and near an old arsenal and an old army\r\npost from which we got a good deal of stuff--some of it practically\r\ncondemned, but which we found serviceable at a pinch, and much better\r\nthan nothing. He organized a horse board in Texas, and began purchasing\r\nall horses that were not too big and were sound. A day or two after he\r\nwas commissioned he wrote out in the office of the Secretary of War,\r\nunder his authority, telegrams to the Governors of Arizona, New Mexico,\r\nOklahoma, and Indian Territory, in substance as follows:\r\n\r\nThe President desires to raise --- volunteers in your Territory to form\r\npart of a regiment of mounted riflemen to be commanded by Leonard Wood,\r\nColonel; Theodore Roosevelt, Lieutenant-Colonel. He desires that the men\r\nselected should be young, sound, good shots and good riders, and that\r\nyou expedite by all means in your power the enrollment of these men.\r\n\r\n(Signed) R. A. ALGER, Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had attended to a few more odds and ends he left\r\nWashington, and the day after his arrival in San Antonio the troops\r\nbegan to arrive.\r\n\r\nFor several weeks before I joined the regiment, to which Wood went ahead\r\nof me, I continued as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, trying to\r\nget some coherence of plan between the War Department and the Navy\r\nDepartment; and also being used by Wood to finish getting the equipment\r\nfor the regiment. As regards finding out what the plans of the War\r\nDepartment were, the task was simple. They had no plans. Even during the\r\nfinal months before the outbreak of hostilities very little was done in\r\nthe way of efficient preparation. On one occasion, when every one knew\r\nthat the declaration of war was sure to come in a few days, I went on\r\nmilitary business to the office of one of the highest line generals of\r\nthe army, a man who at that moment ought to have been working eighteen\r\nhours out of the twenty-four on the vital problems ahead of him. What he\r\nwas actually doing was trying on a new type of smart-looking uniform\r\non certain enlisted men; and he called me in to ask my advice as to the\r\nposition of the pockets in the blouse, with a view to making it look\r\nattractive. An aide of this general--funnily enough a good fighting man\r\nin actual service--when I consulted him as to what my uniform for the\r\ncampaign should be, laid special stress upon my purchasing a pair of\r\nblack top boots for full dress, explaining that they were very effective\r\non hotel piazzas and in parlors. I did not intend to be in any hotel\r\nif it could possibly be avoided; and as things turned out, I had no\r\nfull-dress uniform, nothing but my service uniform, during my brief\r\nexperience in the army.\r\n\r\nI suppose that war always does bring out what is highest and lowest in\r\nhuman nature. The contractors who furnish poor materials to the army or\r\nthe navy in time of war stand on a level of infamy only one degree above\r\nthat of the participants in the white slave traffic themselves. But\r\nthere is conduct far short of this which yet seems inexplicable to any\r\nman who has in him any spirit of disinterested patriotism combined\r\nwith any power of imagination. Respectable men, who I suppose lack the\r\nimagination thoroughly to realize what they are doing, try to make money\r\nout of the Nation's necessities in war at the very time that other men\r\nare making every sacrifice, financial and personal, for the cause. In\r\nthe closing weeks of my service as Assistant Secretary of the Navy we\r\nwere collecting ships for auxiliary purposes. Some men, at cost to their\r\nown purses, helped us freely and with efficiency; others treated the\r\naffair as an ordinary business transaction; and yet others endeavored,\r\nat some given crisis when our need was great, to sell us inferior\r\nvessels at exorbitant prices, and used every pressure, through Senators\r\nand Congressmen, to accomplish their ends. In one or two cases they did\r\naccomplish them too, until we got a really first-class board established\r\nto superintend such purchases. A more curious experience was in\r\nconnection with the point chosen for the starting of the expedition\r\nagainst Cuba. I had not supposed that any human being could consider\r\nthis matter save from the standpoint of military need. But one morning\r\na very wealthy and influential man, a respectable and upright man\r\naccording to his own lights, called on me to protest against our choice\r\nof Tampa, and to put in a plea for a certain other port, on the ground\r\nthat his railroad was entitled to its share of the profit for hauling\r\nthe army and equipment! I happened to know that at this time this\r\nvery man had kinsfolk with the army, who served gallantly, and the\r\ncircumstances of his coming to me were such as to show that he was not\r\nacting secretly, and had no idea that there was anything out of the way\r\nin his proposal. I think the facts were merely that he had been trained\r\nto regard business as the sole object in life, and that he lacked the\r\nimagination to enable him to understand the real nature of the request\r\nthat he was making; and, moreover, he had good reason to believe that\r\none of his business competitors had been unduly favored.\r\n\r\nThe War Department was in far worse shape than the Navy Department. The\r\nyoung officers turned out from West Point are precisely as good as the\r\nyoung officers turned out from Annapolis, and this always has been true.\r\nBut at that time (something has been done to remedy the worst conditions\r\nsince), and ever since the close of the Civil War, the conditions were\r\nsuch that after a few years the army officer stagnated so far as his\r\nprofession was concerned. When the Spanish War broke out the navy really\r\nwas largely on a war footing, as any navy which is even respectably\r\ncared for in time of peace must be. The admirals, captains, and\r\nlieutenants were continually practicing their profession in almost\r\nprecisely the way that it has to be practiced in time of war. Except\r\nactually shooting at a foe, most of the men on board ship went through\r\nin time of peace practically all that they would have to go through in\r\ntime of war. The heads of bureaus in the Navy Department were for the\r\nmost part men who had seen sea service, who expected to return to sea\r\nservice, and who were preparing for needs which they themselves knew by\r\nexperience. Moreover, the civilian head of the navy had to provide for\r\nkeeping the ships in a state of reasonable efficiency, and Congress\r\ncould not hopelessly misbehave itself about the navy without the fact at\r\nonce becoming evident.\r\n\r\nAll this was changed so far as the army was concerned. Not only was it\r\npossible to decrease the efficiency of the army without being called\r\nto account for it, but the only way in which the Secretary of War could\r\ngain credit for himself or the Administration was by economy, and the\r\neasiest way to economize was in connection with something that would not\r\nbe felt unless war should arise. The people took no interest whatever in\r\nthe army; demagogues clamored against it, and, inadequate though it\r\nwas in size, insisted that it should be still further reduced. Popular\r\norators always appealed to the volunteers; the regulars had no votes and\r\nthere was no point in politicians thinking of them. The chief activity\r\nshown by Congressmen about the army was in getting special army posts\r\nbuilt in places where there was no need for them. Even the work of the\r\narmy in its campaigns against the Indians was of such a character that\r\nit was generally performed by small bodies of fifty or a hundred\r\nmen. Until a man ceased being a lieutenant he usually had plenty of\r\nprofessional work to attend to and was employed in the field, and, in\r\nshort, had the same kind of practice that his brother in the navy had,\r\nand he did his work as well. But once past this stage he had almost\r\nno opportunity to perform any work corresponding to his rank, and but\r\nlittle opportunity to do any military work whatsoever. The very best\r\nmen, men like Lawton, Young, Chaffee, Hawkins, and Sumner, to mention\r\nonly men under or beside whom I served, remained good soldiers, soldiers\r\nof the best stamp, in spite of the disheartening conditions. But it\r\nwas not to be expected that the average man could continue to grow\r\nwhen every influence was against him. Accordingly, when the Spanish War\r\nsuddenly burst upon us, a number of inert elderly captains and field\r\nofficers were, much against their own wishes, suddenly pitchforked into\r\nthe command of regiments, brigades, and even divisions and army corps.\r\nOften these men failed painfully. This was not their fault; it was the\r\nfault of the Nation, that is, the fault of all of us, of you, my reader,\r\nand of myself, and of those like us, because we had permitted conditions\r\nto be such as to render these men unfit for command. Take a stout\r\ncaptain of an out-of-the-way two-company post, where nothing in the\r\nworld ever occurred even resembling military action, and where the only\r\nmilitary problem that really convulsed the post to its foundations was\r\nthe quarrel between the captain and the quartermaster as to how high a\r\nmule's tail ought to be shaved (I am speaking of an actual incident).\r\nWhat could be expected of such a man, even though thirty-five years\r\nbefore he had been a gallant second lieutenant in the Civil War, if,\r\nafter this intervening do-nothing period, he was suddenly put in command\r\nof raw troops in a midsummer campaign in the tropics?\r\n\r\nThe bureau chiefs were for the most part elderly incompetents, whose\r\nidea was to do their routine duties in such way as to escape the\r\ncensure of routine bureaucratic superiors and to avoid a Congressional\r\ninvestigation. They had not the slightest conception of preparing\r\nthe army for war. It was impossible that they could have any such\r\nconception. The people and the Congress did not wish the army prepared\r\nfor war; and those editors and philanthropists and peace advocates who\r\nfelt vaguely that if the army were incompetent their principles were\r\nsafe, always inveighed against any proposal to make it efficient, on the\r\nground that this showed a natural bloodthirstiness in the proposer. When\r\nsuch were the conditions, it was absolutely impossible that either the\r\nWar Department or the army could do well in the event of war. Secretary\r\nAlger happened to be Secretary when war broke out, and all the\r\nresponsibility for the shortcomings of the Department were visited\r\nupon his devoted head. He was made the scapegoat for our National\r\nshortcomings. The fault was not his; the fault and responsibility\r\nlay with us, the people, who for thirty-three years had permitted our\r\nrepresentatives in Congress and in National executive office to bear\r\nthemselves so that it was absolutely impossible to avoid the great bulk\r\nof all the trouble that occurred, and of all the shortcomings of which\r\nour people complained, during the Spanish War. The chief immediate cause\r\nwas the conditions of red-tape bureaucracy which existed in the War\r\nDepartment at Washington, which had prevented any good organization\r\nor the preparation of any good plan of operation for using our men and\r\nsupplies. The recurrence of these conditions, even though in somewhat\r\nless aggravated form, in any future emergency is as certain as sunrise\r\nunless we bring about the principle of a four years' detail in the staff\r\ncorps--a principle which Congress has now for years stubbornly refused\r\nto grant.\r\n\r\nThere are nations who only need to have peaceful ideals inculcated, and\r\nto whom militarism is a curse and a misfortune. There are other nations,\r\nlike our own, so happily situated that the thought of war is never\r\npresent to their minds. They are wholly free from any tendency\r\nimproperly to exalt or to practice militarism. These nations should\r\nnever forget that there must be military ideals no less than peaceful\r\nideals. The exaltation of Nogi's career, set forth so strikingly in\r\nStanley Washburn's little volume on the great Japanese warrior, contains\r\nmuch that is especially needed for us of America, prone as we are to\r\nregard the exigencies of a purely commercial and industrial civilization\r\nas excusing us from the need of admiring and practicing the heroic and\r\nwarlike virtues.\r\n\r\nOur people are not military. We need normally only a small standing\r\narmy; but there should be behind it a reserve of instructed men big\r\nenough to fill it up to full war strength, which is over twice the peace\r\nstrength. Moreover, the young men of the country should realize that it\r\nis the duty of every one of them to prepare himself so that in time of\r\nneed he may speedily become an efficient soldier--a duty now generally\r\nforgotten, but which should be recognized as one of the vitally\r\nessential parts of every man's training.\r\n\r\nIn endeavoring to get the \"Rough Riders\" equipped I met with some\r\nexperiences which were both odd and instructive. There were not enough\r\narms and other necessaries to go round, and there was keen rivalry among\r\nthe intelligent and zealous commanders of the volunteer organizations as\r\nto who should get first choice. Wood's experience was what enabled us to\r\nequip ourselves in short order. There was another cavalry organization\r\nwhose commander was at the War Department about this time, and we had\r\nbeen eyeing him with much alertness as a rival. One day I asked him\r\nwhat his plans were about arming and drilling his troops, who were of\r\nprecisely the type of our own men. He answered that he expected \"to give\r\neach of the boys two revolvers and a lariat, and then just turn them\r\nloose.\" I reported the conversation to Wood, with the remark that we\r\nmight feel ourselves safe from rivalry in that quarter; and safe we\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nIn trying to get the equipment I met with checks and rebuffs, and in\r\nreturn was the cause of worry and concern to various bureau chiefs\r\nwho were unquestionably estimable men in their private and domestic\r\nrelations, and who doubtless had been good officers thirty years\r\nbefore, but who were as unfit for modern war as if they were so many\r\nsmooth-bores. One fine old fellow did his best to persuade us to take\r\nblack powder rifles, explaining with paternal indulgence that no one yet\r\nreally knew just what smokeless powder might do, and that there was a\r\ngood deal to be said in favor of having smoke to conceal us from the\r\nenemy. I saw this pleasing theory actually worked out in practice later\r\non, for the National Guard regiments with us at Santiago had black\r\npowder muskets, and the regular artillery black powder guns, and they\r\nreally might almost as well have replaced these weapons by crossbows\r\nand mangonels. We succeeded, thanks to Wood, in getting the same cavalry\r\ncarbines that were used by the regulars. We were determined to do this,\r\nnot only because the weapons were good, but because this would in all\r\nprobability mean that we were brigaded with the regular cavalry, which\r\nit was certain would be sent immediately to the front for the fighting.\r\n\r\nThere was one worthy bureau chief who was continually refusing\r\napplications of mine as irregular. In each case I would appeal to\r\nSecretary Alger--who helped me in every way--and get an order from him\r\ncountenancing the irregularity. For instance, I found out that as we\r\nwere nearer the July date than the January date for the issuance of\r\nclothing, and as it had long been customary to issue the winter clothing\r\nin July, so as to give ample leisure for getting it to all the various\r\nposts, it was therefore solemnly proposed to issue this same winter\r\nclothing to us who were about to start for a summer campaign in the\r\ntropics. This would seem incredible to those who have never dealt with\r\nan inert officialdom, a red-tape bureaucracy, but such is the fact. I\r\nrectified this and got an order for khaki clothing. We were then told we\r\nwould have to advertise thirty days for horses. This meant that we would\r\nhave missed the Santiago expedition. So I made another successful appeal\r\nto the Secretary. Other difficulties came up about wagons, and various\r\narticles, and in each case the same result followed. On the last\r\noccasion, when I came up in triumph with the needed order, the worried\r\noffice head, who bore me no animosity, but who did feel that fate had\r\nbeen very unkind, threw himself back in his chair and exclaimed with a\r\nsigh: \"Oh, dear! I had this office running in such good shape--and then\r\nalong came the war and upset everything!\" His feeling was that war was\r\nan illegitimate interruption to the work of the War Department.\r\n\r\nThere were of course department heads and bureau chiefs and assistants\r\nwho, in spite of the worthlessness of the system, and of the paralyzing\r\nconditions that had prevailed, remained first-class men. An example\r\nof these was Commissary-General Weston. His energy, activity,\r\nadministrative efficiency, and common sense were supplemented by an\r\neager desire to help everybody do the best that could be done. Both in\r\nWashington and again down at Santiago we owed him very much. When I was\r\nPresident, it was my good fortune to repay him in part our debt,\r\nwhich means the debt of the people of the country, by making him a\r\nmajor-general.\r\n\r\nThe regiment assembled at San Antonio. When I reached there, the men,\r\nrifles, and horses, which were the essentials, were coming in fast, and\r\nthe saddles, blankets, and the like were also accumulating. Thanks to\r\nWood's exertions, when we reached Tampa we were rather better equipped\r\nthan most of the regular regiments. We adhered strictly to field\r\nequipment, allowing no luxuries or anything else unnecessary, and so\r\nwe were able to move off the field when ordered, with our own\r\ntransportation, leaving nothing behind.\r\n\r\nI suppose every man tends to brag about his regiment; but it does seem\r\nto me that there never was a regiment better worth bragging about\r\nthan ours. Wood was an exceptional commander, of great power, with a\r\nremarkable gift for organization. The rank and file were as fine natural\r\nfighting men as ever carried a rifle or rode a horse in any country or\r\nany age. We had a number of first-class young fellows from the East,\r\nmost of them from colleges like Harvard, Yale, and Princeton; but\r\nthe great majority of the men were Southwesterners, from the then\r\nterritories of Oklahoma, Indian Territory, Arizona, and New Mexico. They\r\nwere accustomed to the use of firearms, accustomed to taking care of\r\nthemselves in the open; they were intelligent and self-reliant; they\r\npossessed hardihood and endurance and physical prowess; and, above all,\r\nthey had the fighting edge, the cool and resolute fighting temper. They\r\nwent into the war with full knowledge, having deliberately counted the\r\ncost. In the great majority of cases each man was chiefly anxious to\r\nfind out what he should do to make the regiment a success. They bought,\r\nfirst and last, about 800 copies of the cavalry drill regulations and\r\nstudied them industriously. Such men were practically soldiers to\r\nstart with, in all the essentials. It is small wonder that with them as\r\nmaterial to work upon the regiment was raised, armed, equipped, drilled,\r\nsent on trains to Tampa, embarked, disembarked, and put through two\r\nvictorious offensive--not defensive--fights in which a third of the\r\nofficers and one-fifth of the men were killed or wounded, all within\r\nsixty days. It is a good record, and it speaks well for the men of the\r\nregiment; and it speaks well for Wood.[*]\r\n\r\n     [*] To counterbalance the newspapers which ignorantly and\r\n     indiscriminately praised all the volunteers there were\r\n     others whose blame was of the same intelligent quality. The\r\n     New York _Evening Post_, on June 18, gave expression to the\r\n     following gloomy foreboding: \"Competent observers have\r\n     remarked that nothing more extraordinary has been done than\r\n     the sending to Cuba of the First United States Volunteer\r\n     Cavalry, known as the 'rough riders.' Organized but four\r\n     weeks, barely given their full complement of officers, and\r\n     only a week of regular drill, these men have been sent to\r\n     the front before they have learned the first elements of\r\n     soldiering and discipline, or have even become acquainted\r\n     with their officers. In addition to all this, like the\r\n     regular cavalry, they have been sent with only their\r\n     carbines and revolvers to meet an enemy armed with long-range\r\n          rifles. There have been few cases of such military\r\n     cruelty in our military annals.\" A week or so after this not\r\n     wholly happy prophecy was promulgated, the \"cruelty\" was\r\n     consummated, first at Las Guasimas and then in the San Juan\r\n     fighting.\r\n\r\nWood was so busy getting the regiment ready that when I reached San\r\nAntonio he turned most of the drilling of it over to me. This was a\r\npiece of great good fortune for me, and I drilled the men industriously,\r\nmounted and unmounted. I had plenty to learn, and the men and the\r\nofficers even more; but we went at our work with the heartiest good\r\nwill. We speedily made it evident that there was no room and no mercy\r\nfor any man who shirked any duty, and we accomplished good results.\r\nThe fact is that the essentials of drill and work for a cavalry or an\r\ninfantry regiment are easy to learn, which of course is not true for the\r\nartillery or the engineers or for the navy. The reason why it takes\r\nso long to turn the average civilized man into a good infantryman\r\nor cavalryman is because it takes a long while to teach the average\r\nuntrained man how to shoot, to ride, to march, to take care of himself\r\nin the open, to be alert, resourceful, cool, daring, and resolute, to\r\nobey quickly, as well as to be willing, and to fit himself, to act on\r\nhis own responsibility. If he already possesses these qualities, there\r\nis very little difficulty in making him a soldier; all the drill that is\r\nnecessary to enable him to march and to fight is of a simple character.\r\nParade ground and barrack square maneuvers are of no earthly consequence\r\nin real war. When men can readily change from line to column, and column\r\nto line, can form front in any direction, and assemble and scatter, and\r\ncan do these things with speed and precision, they have a fairly good\r\ngrasp of the essentials. When our regiment reached Tampa it could\r\nalready be handled creditably at fast gaits, and both in mass and\r\nextended formations, mounted and dismounted.\r\n\r\nI had served three years in the New York National Guard, finally\r\nbecoming a captain. This experience was invaluable to me. It enabled me\r\nat once to train the men in the simple drill without which they would\r\nhave been a mob; for although the drill requirements are simple,\r\nthey are also absolutely indispensable. But if I had believed that my\r\nexperience in the National Guard had taught me all that there was to\r\nteach about a soldier's career, it would have been better for me not to\r\nhave been in it at all. There were in the regiment a number of men who\r\nhad served in the National Guard, and a number of others who had served\r\nin the Regular Army. Some of these latter had served in the field in\r\nthe West under campaign conditions, and were accustomed to long marches,\r\nprivation, risk, and unexpected emergencies. These men were of the\r\nutmost benefit to the regiment. They already knew their profession, and\r\ncould teach and help the others. But if the man had merely served in\r\na National Guard regiment, or in the Regular Army at some post in a\r\ncivilized country where he learned nothing except what could be picked\r\nup on the parade ground, in the barracks, and in practice marches of a\r\nfew miles along good roads, then it depended purely upon his own good\r\nsense whether he had been helped or hurt by the experience. If he\r\nrealized that he had learned only five per cent of his profession, that\r\nthere remained ninety-five per cent to accomplish before he would be a\r\ngood soldier, why, he had profited immensely.\r\n\r\nTo start with five per cent handicap was a very great advantage; and if\r\nthe man was really a good man, he could not be overtaken. But if the\r\nman thought that he had learned all about the profession of a soldier\r\nbecause he had been in the National Guard or in the Regular Army under\r\nthe conditions I have described, then he was actually of less use than\r\nif he had never had any military experience at all. Such a man was\r\napt to think that nicety of alignment, precision in wheeling, and\r\ncorrectness in the manual of arms were the ends of training and the\r\nguarantees of good soldiership, and that from guard mounting to sentry\r\nduty everything in war was to be done in accordance with what he had\r\nlearned in peace. As a matter of fact, most of what he had learned was\r\nnever used at all, and some of it had to be unlearned. The one thing,\r\nfor instance, that a sentry ought never to do in an actual campaign is\r\nto walk up and down a line where he will be conspicuous. His business\r\nis to lie down somewhere off a ridge crest where he can see any one\r\napproaching, but where a man approaching cannot see him. As for the\r\nceremonies, during the really hard part of a campaign only the barest\r\nessentials are kept.\r\n\r\nAlmost all of the junior regular officers, and many of the senior\r\nregular officers, were fine men. But, through no fault of their own, had\r\nbeen forced to lead lives that fairly paralyzed their efficiency when\r\nthe strain of modern war came on them. The routine elderly regular\r\nofficer who knew nothing whatever of modern war was in most respects\r\nnearly as worthless as a raw recruit. The positions and commands\r\nprescribed in the text-books were made into fetishes by some of these\r\nmen, and treated as if they were the ends, instead of the not always\r\nimportant means by which the ends were to be achieved. In the Cuban\r\nfighting, for instance, it would have been folly for me to have taken my\r\nplace in the rear of the regiment, the canonical text-book position. My\r\nbusiness was to be where I could keep most command over the regiment,\r\nand, in a rough-and-tumble, scrambling fight in thick jungle, this had\r\nto depend upon the course of events, and usually meant that I had to be\r\nat the front. I saw in that fighting more than one elderly regimental\r\ncommander who unwittingly rendered the only service he could render to\r\nhis regiment by taking up his proper position several hundred yards in\r\nthe rear when the fighting began; for then the regiment disappeared in\r\nthe jungle, and for its good fortune the commanding officer never saw it\r\nagain until long after the fight was over.\r\n\r\nAfter one Cuban fight a lieutenant-colonel of the regulars, in command\r\nof a regiment, who had met with just such an experience and had rejoined\r\nus at the front several hours after the close of the fighting, asked me\r\nwhat my men were doing when the fight began. I answered that they were\r\nfollowing in trace in column of twos, and that the instant the shooting\r\nbegan I deployed them as skirmishers on both sides of the trail. He\r\nanswered triumphantly, \"You can't deploy men as skirmishers from column\r\nformation\"; to which I responded, \"Well, I did, and, what is more, if\r\nany captain had made any difficulty about it, I would have sent him\r\nto the rear.\" My critic was quite correct from the parade ground\r\nstandpoint. The prescribed orders at that time were to deploy the column\r\nfirst into a line of squads at correct intervals, and then to give an\r\norder which, if my memory serves correctly, ran: \"As skirmishers, by the\r\nright and left flanks, at six yards, take intervals, march.\" The order I\r\nreally gave ran more like this: \"Scatter out to the right there, quick,\r\nyou! scatter to the left! look alive, look alive!\" And they looked\r\nalive, and they scattered, and each took advantage of cover, and forward\r\nwent the line.\r\n\r\nNow I do not wish what I have said to be misunderstood. If ever we have\r\na great war, the bulk of our soldiers will not be men who have had any\r\nopportunity to train soul and mind and body so as to meet the iron needs\r\nof an actual campaign. Long continued and faithful drill will alone put\r\nthese men in shape to begin to do their duty, and failure to recognize\r\nthis on the part of the average man will mean laziness and folly and\r\nnot the possession of efficiency. Moreover, if men have been trained\r\nto believe, for instance, that they can \"arbitrate questions of\r\nvital interest and national honor,\" if they have been brought up with\r\nflabbiness of moral fiber as well as flabbiness of physique, then there\r\nwill be need of long and laborious and faithful work to give the needed\r\ntone to mind and body. But if the men have in them the right stuff, it\r\nis not so very difficult.\r\n\r\nAt San Antonio we entrained for Tampa. In various sociological books\r\nby authors of Continental Europe, there are jeremiads as to the way\r\nin which service in the great European armies, with their minute and\r\nmachine-like efficiency and regularity, tends to dwarf the capacity\r\nfor individual initiative among the officers and men. There is no such\r\ndanger for any officer or man of a volunteer organization in America\r\nwhen our country, with playful light-heartedness, has pranced into war\r\nwithout making any preparation for it. I know no larger or finer field\r\nfor the display of an advanced individualism than that which opened\r\nbefore us as we went from San Antonio to Tampa, camped there, and\r\nembarked on a transport for Cuba. Nobody ever had any definite\r\ninformation to give us, and whatever information we unearthed on our\r\nown account was usually wrong. Each of us had to show an alert and\r\nnot overscrupulous self-reliance in order to obtain food for his men,\r\nprovender for his horses, or transportation of any kind for any object.\r\nOne lesson early impressed on me was that if I wanted anything to eat it\r\nwas wise to carry it with me; and if any new war should arise, I would\r\nearnestly advise the men of every volunteer organization always to\r\nproceed upon the belief that their supplies will not turn up, and to\r\ntake every opportunity of getting food for themselves.\r\n\r\nTampa was a scene of the wildest confusion. There were miles of tracks\r\nloaded with cars of the contents of which nobody seemed to have any\r\ndefinite knowledge. General Miles, who was supposed to have supervision\r\nover everything, and General Shafter, who had charge of the expedition,\r\nwere both there. But, thanks to the fact that nobody had had any\r\nexperience in handling even such a small force as ours--about 17,000\r\nmen--there was no semblance of order. Wood and I were bound that we\r\nshould not be left behind when the expedition started. When we were\r\nfinally informed that it was to leave next morning, we were ordered to\r\ngo to a certain track to meet a train. We went to the track, but the\r\ntrain never came. Then we were sent to another track to meet another\r\ntrain. Again it never came. However, we found a coal train, of which we\r\ntook possession, and the conductor, partly under duress and partly in a\r\nspirit of friendly helpfulness, took us down to the quay.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of other organizations, infantry and cavalry, regular and\r\nvolunteer, were arriving at the quay and wandering around it, and there\r\nwas no place where we could get any specific information as to what\r\ntransport we were to have. Finally Wood was told to \"get any ship you\r\ncan get which is not already assigned.\" He borrowed without leave a\r\nsmall motor boat, and commandeered the transport Yucatan. When asked by\r\nthe captain what his authority was, he reported that he was acting \"by\r\norders of General Shafter,\" and directed the ship to be brought to\r\nthe dock. He had already sent me word to be ready, as soon as the ship\r\ntouched the pier, to put the regiment aboard her. I found that she had\r\nalready been assigned to a regular regiment, and to another volunteer\r\nregiment, and as it was evident that not more than half of the men\r\nassigned to her could possibly get on, I was determined that we\r\nshould not be among the men left off. The volunteer regiment offered\r\na comparatively easy problem. I simply marched my men past them to the\r\nallotted place and held the gangway. With the regulars I had to be a\r\nlittle more diplomatic, because their commander, a lieutenant-colonel,\r\nwas my superior in rank, and also doubtless knew his rights. He sent\r\nword to me to make way, to draw my regiment off to one side, and let his\r\ntake possession of the gangway. I could see the transport coming in,\r\nand could dimly make out Wood's figure thereon. Accordingly I played for\r\ntime. I sent respectful requests through his officers to the commander\r\nof the regulars, entered into parleys, and made protestations, until the\r\ntransport got near enough so that by yelling at the top of my voice I\r\nwas able to get into a--highly constructive--communication with Wood.\r\nWhat he was saying I had no idea, but he was evidently speaking, and\r\non my own responsibility I translated it into directions to hold the\r\ngangway, and so informed the regulars that I was under the orders of\r\nmy superior and of a ranking officer, and--to my great regret, etc.,\r\netc.--could not give way as they desired. As soon as the transport was\r\nfast we put our men aboard at the double. Half of the regular regiment\r\ngot on, and the other half and the other volunteer regiment went\r\nsomewhere else.\r\n\r\nWe were kept several days on the transport, which was jammed with men,\r\nso that it was hard to move about on the deck. Then the fleet got\r\nunder way, and we steamed slowly down to Santiago. Here we disembarked,\r\nhiggledy-piggledy, just as we had embarked. Different parts of different\r\noutfits were jumbled together, and it was no light labor afterwards to\r\nassemble the various batteries. For instance, one transport had guns,\r\nand another the locks for the guns; the two not getting together for\r\nseveral days after one of them had been landed. Soldiers went here,\r\nprovisions there; and who got ashore first largely depended upon\r\nindividual activity. Fortunately for us, my former naval aide, when I\r\nhad been Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Lieutenant-Commander Sharp, a\r\nfirst-class fellow, was there in command of a little ship to which I had\r\nsucceeded in getting him appointed before I left the Navy Department. He\r\ngave us a black pilot, who took our transport right in shore, the others\r\nfollowing like a flock of sheep; and we disembarked with our rifles,\r\nammunition belts, and not much else. In theory it was out of our turn,\r\nbut if we had not disembarked then, Heaven only knows when our turn\r\nwould have come, and we did not intend to be out of the fighting if we\r\ncould help it. I carried some food in my pockets, and a light waterproof\r\ncoat, which was my sole camp equipment for the next two or three days.\r\nTwenty-four hours after getting ashore we marched from Daiquiri, where\r\nwe had landed, to Siboney, also on the coast, reaching it during a\r\nterrific downpour of rain. When this was over, we built a fire, dried\r\nour clothes, and ate whatever we had brought with us.\r\n\r\nWe were brigaded with the First and Tenth Regular Cavalry, under\r\nBrigadier-General Sam Young. He was a fine type of the American regular.\r\nLike General Chaffee, another of the same type, he had entered the army\r\nin the Civil War as a private. Later, when I was President, it was my\r\ngood fortune to make each of them in succession Lieutenant-General of\r\nthe army of the United States. When General Young retired and General\r\nChaffee was to take his place, the former sent to the latter his three\r\nstars to wear on his first official presentation, with a note that they\r\nwere from \"Private Young to Private Chaffee.\" The two fine old fellows\r\nhad served in the ranks, one in the cavalry, one in the infantry, in\r\ntheir golden youth, in the days of the great war nearly half a century\r\nbefore; each had grown gray in a lifetime of honorable service under the\r\nflag, and each closed his active career in command of the army. General\r\nYoung was one of the few men who had given and taken wounds with the\r\nsaber. He was an old friend of mine, and when in Washington before\r\nstarting for the front he told me that if we got in his brigade he would\r\nput us into the fighting all right. He kept his word.\r\n\r\nGeneral Young had actively superintended getting his two regular\r\nregiments, or at least a squadron of each, off the transports, and late\r\nthat night he sent us word that he had received permission to move at\r\ndawn and strike the Spanish advance position. He directed us to move\r\nalong a ridge trail with our two squadrons (one squadron having been\r\nleft at Tampa), while with the two squadrons of regulars, one of the\r\nFirst and one of the Tenth, under his personal supervision, he marched\r\nup the valley trail. Accordingly Wood took us along the hill trail early\r\nnext morning, till we struck the Spaniards, and began our fight just as\r\nthe regulars began the fight in the valley trail.\r\n\r\nIt was a mountainous country covered with thick jungle, a most confusing\r\ncountry, and I had an awful time trying to get into the fight and trying\r\nto do what was right when in it; and all the while I was thinking that\r\nI was the only man who did not know what I was about, and that all the\r\nothers did--whereas, as I found out later, pretty much everybody else\r\nwas as much in the dark as I was. There was no surprise; we struck the\r\nSpaniards exactly where we had expected; then Wood halted us and put\r\nus into the fight deliberately and in order. He ordered us to deploy\r\nalternately by troops to the right and left of the trail, giving our\r\nsenior major, Brodie, a West Pointer and as good a soldier as ever wore\r\na uniform, the left wing, while I took the right wing. I was told if\r\npossible to connect with the regulars who were on the right. In theory\r\nthis was excellent, but as the jungle was very dense the first troop\r\nthat deployed to the right vanished forthwith, and I never saw it again\r\nuntil the fight was over--having a frightful feeling meanwhile that I\r\nmight be court-martialed for losing it. The next troop deployed to the\r\nleft under Brodie. Then the third came along, and I started to deploy it\r\nto the right as before.\r\n\r\nBy the time the first platoon had gotten into the jungle I realized that\r\nit likewise would disappear unless I kept hold of it. I managed to\r\nkeep possession of the last platoon. One learns fast in a fight, and I\r\nmarched this platoon and my next two troops in column through the jungle\r\nwithout any attempt to deploy until we got on the firing line. This\r\nsounds simple. But it was not. I did not know when I had gotten on the\r\nfiring line! I could hear a good deal of firing, some over to my right\r\nat a good distance, and the rest to the left and ahead. I pushed on,\r\nexpecting to strike the enemy somewhere between.\r\n\r\nSoon we came to the brink of a deep valley. There was a good deal of\r\ncracking of rifles way off in front of us, but as they used smokeless\r\npowder we had no idea as to exactly where they were, or who they were\r\nshooting at. Then it dawned on us that we were the target. The bullets\r\nbegan to come overhead, making a sound like the ripping of a silk dress,\r\nwith sometimes a kind of pop; a few of my men fell, and I deployed the\r\nrest, making them lie down and get behind trees. Richard Harding Davis\r\nwas with us, and as we scanned the landscape with our glasses it was\r\nhe who first pointed out to us some Spaniards in a trench some\r\nthree-quarters of a mile off. It was difficult to make them out. There\r\nwere not many of them. However, we finally did make them out, and\r\nwe could see their conical hats, for the trench was a poor one. We\r\nadvanced, firing at them, and drove them off.\r\n\r\nWhat to do then I had not an idea. The country in front fell away into\r\na very difficult jungle-filled valley. There was nothing but jungle all\r\naround, and if I advanced I was afraid I might get out of touch with\r\neverybody and not be going in the right direction. Moreover, as far as\r\nI could see, there was now nobody in front who was shooting at us,\r\nalthough some of the men on my left insisted that our own men had fired\r\ninto us--an allegation which I soon found was almost always made in such\r\na fight, and which in this case was not true. At this moment some of the\r\nregulars appeared across the ravine on our right. The first thing they\r\ndid was to fire a volley at us, but one of our first sergeants went up a\r\ntree and waved a guidon at them and they stopped. Firing was still going\r\non to our left, however, and I was never more puzzled to know what to\r\ndo. I did not wish to take my men out of their position without orders,\r\nfor fear that I might thereby be leaving a gap if there was a Spanish\r\nforce which meditated an offensive return. On the other hand, it did\r\nnot seem to me that I had been doing enough fighting to justify my\r\nexistence, and there was obviously fighting going on to the left. I\r\nremember that I kept thinking of the refrain of the fox-hunting song,\r\n\"Here's to every friend who struggled to the end\"; in the hunting field\r\nI had always acted on this theory, and, no matter how discouraging\r\nappearances might be, had never stopped trying to get in at the death\r\nuntil the hunt was actually over; and now that there was work, and not\r\nplay, on hand, I intended to struggle as hard as I knew how not to\r\nbe left out of any fighting into which I could, with any possible\r\npropriety, get.\r\n\r\nSo I left my men where they were and started off at a trot toward where\r\nthe firing was, with a couple of orderlies to send back for the men in\r\ncase that proved advisable. Like most tyros, I was wearing my sword,\r\nwhich in thick jungle now and then got between my legs--from that day on\r\nit always went corded in the baggage. I struck the trail, and began to\r\npass occasional dead men. Pretty soon I reached Wood and found, much to\r\nmy pleasure, that I had done the right thing, for as I came up word was\r\nbrought to him that Brodie had been shot, and he at once sent me to take\r\ncharge of the left wing. It was more open country here, and at least I\r\nwas able to get a glimpse of my own men and exercise some control over\r\nthem. There was much firing going on, but for the life of me I could not\r\nsee any Spaniards, and neither could any one else. Finally we made up\r\nour minds that they were shooting at us from a set of red-tiled ranch\r\nbuildings a good way in front, and these I assaulted, finally charging\r\nthem. Before we came anywhere near, the Spaniards, who, as it proved,\r\nreally were inside and around them, abandoned them, leaving a few dead\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nBy the time I had taken possession of these buildings all firing had\r\nceased everywhere. I had not the faintest idea what had happened:\r\nwhether the fight was over; or whether this was merely a lull in the\r\nfight; or where the Spaniards were; or whether we might be attacked\r\nagain; or whether we ought ourselves to attack somebody somewhere else.\r\nI got my men in order and sent out small parties to explore the ground\r\nin front, who returned without finding any foe. (By this time, as a\r\nmatter of fact, the Spaniards were in full retreat.) Meanwhile I was\r\nextending my line so as to get into touch with our people on the right.\r\nWord was brought to me that Wood had been shot--which fortunately proved\r\nnot to be true--and as, if this were so, it meant that I must take\r\ncharge of the regiment, I moved over personally to inquire. Soon I\r\nlearned that he was all right, that the Spaniards had retreated along\r\nthe main road, and that Colonel Wood and two or three other officers\r\nwere a short distance away. Before I reached them I encountered a\r\ncaptain of the Ninth Cavalry, very glum because his troopers had not\r\nbeen up in time to take part in the fight, and he congratulated me--with\r\nvisible effort!--upon my share in our first victory. I thanked him\r\ncordially, not confiding in him that till that moment I myself knew\r\nexceeding little about the victory; and proceeded to where Generals\r\nWheeler, Lawton, and Chaffee, who had just come up, in company with\r\nWood, were seated on a bank. They expressed appreciation of the way that\r\nI had handled my troops, first on the right wing and then on the left!\r\nAs I was quite prepared to find I had committed some awful sin, I did my\r\nbest to accept this in a nonchalant manner, and not to look as relieved\r\nas I felt. As throughout the morning I had preserved a specious aspect\r\nof wisdom, and had commanded first one and then the other wing, the\r\nfight was really a capital thing for me, for practically all the men\r\nhad served under my actual command, and thenceforth felt an enthusiastic\r\nbelief that I would lead them aright.\r\n\r\nIt was a week after this skirmish before the army made the advance on\r\nSantiago. Just before this occurred General Young was stricken down with\r\nfever. General Wheeler, who had commanded the Cavalry Division, was put\r\nin general charge of the left wing of the army, which fought before the\r\ncity itself. Brigadier-General Sam Sumner, an excellent officer, who had\r\nthe second cavalry brigade, took command of the cavalry division, and\r\nWood took command of our brigade, while, to my intense delight, I got\r\nmy regiment. I therefore had command of the regiment before the stiffest\r\nfighting occurred. Later, when Wood was put in command in Santiago, I\r\nbecame the brigade commander.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening we camped at El Poso. There were two regular\r\nofficers, the brigade commander's aides, Lieutenants A. L. Mills and W.\r\nE. Shipp, who were camped by our regiment. Each of my men had food in\r\nhis haversack, but I had none, and I would have gone supperless to bed\r\nif Mills and Shipp had not given me out of their scanty stores a big\r\nsandwich, which I shared with my orderly, who also had nothing. Next\r\nmorning my body servant Marshall, an ex-soldier of the Ninth (Colored)\r\nCavalry, a fine and faithful fellow, had turned up and I was able in my\r\nturn to ask Mills and Shipp, who had eaten all their food the preceding\r\nevening, to take breakfast with me. A few hours later gallant Shipp was\r\ndead, and Mills, an exceptionally able officer, had been shot through\r\nthe head from side to side, just back of the eyes; yet he lived,\r\nalthough one eye was blinded, and before I left the Presidency I gave\r\nhim his commission as Brigadier-General.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning our artillery began firing from the hill-crest\r\nimmediately in front of where our men were camped. Several of the\r\nregiment were killed and wounded by the shrapnel of the return fire of\r\nthe Spaniards. One of the shrapnel bullets fell on my wrist and raised\r\na bump as big as a hickory nut, but did not even break the skin. Then\r\nwe were marched down from the hill on a muddy road through thick jungle\r\ntowards Santiago. The heat was great, and we strolled into the fight\r\nwith no definite idea on the part of any one as to what we were to do\r\nor what would happen. There was no plan that our left wing was to make\r\na serious fight that day; and as there were no plans, it was naturally\r\nexceedingly hard to get orders, and each of us had to act largely on his\r\nown responsibility.\r\n\r\nLawton's infantry division attacked the little village of El Caney, some\r\nmiles to the right. Kent's infantry division and Sumner's dismounted\r\ncavalry division were supposed to detain the Spanish army in Santiago\r\nuntil Lawton had captured El Caney. Spanish towns and villages, however,\r\nwith their massive buildings, are natural fortifications, as the French\r\nfound in the Peninsular War, and as both the French and our people found\r\nin Mexico. The Spanish troops in El Caney fought very bravely, as did\r\nthe Spanish troops in front of us, and it was late in the afternoon\r\nbefore Lawton accomplished his task.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we of the left wing had by degrees become involved in a fight\r\nwhich toward the end became not even a colonel's fight, but a squad\r\nleader's fight. The cavalry division was put at the head of the line.\r\nWe were told to march forward, cross a little river in front, and then,\r\nturning to the right, march up alongside the stream until we connected\r\nwith Lawton. Incidentally, this movement would not have brought us\r\ninto touch with Lawton in any event. But we speedily had to abandon any\r\nthought of carrying it out. The maneuver brought us within fair range\r\nof the Spanish intrenchments along the line of hills which we called the\r\nSan Juan Hills, because on one of them was the San Juan blockhouse. On\r\nthat day my regiment had the lead of the second brigade, and we marched\r\ndown the trail following in trace behind the first brigade. Apparently\r\nthe Spaniards could not make up their minds what to do as the three\r\nregular regiments of the first brigade crossed and defiled along the\r\nother bank of the stream, but when our regiment was crossing they began\r\nto fire at us.\r\n\r\nUnder this flank fire it soon became impossible to continue the march.\r\nThe first brigade halted, deployed, and finally began to fire back. Then\r\nour brigade was halted. From time to time some of our men would fall,\r\nand I sent repeated word to the rear to try to get authority to attack\r\nthe hills in front. Finally General Sumner, who was fighting the\r\ndivision in fine shape, sent word to advance. The word was brought to\r\nme by Mills, who said that my orders were to support the regulars in\r\nthe assault on the hills, and that my objective would be the red-tiled\r\nranch-house in front, on a hill which we afterwards christened Kettle\r\nHill. I mention Mills saying this because it was exactly the kind of\r\ndefinite order the giving of which does so much to insure success in a\r\nfight, as it prevents all obscurity as to what is to be done. The order\r\nto attack did not reach the first brigade until after we ourselves\r\nreached it, so that at first there was doubt on the part of their\r\nofficers whether they were at liberty to join in the advance.\r\n\r\nI had not enjoyed the Guasimas fight at all, because I had been so\r\nuncertain as to what I ought to do. But the San Juan fight was entirely\r\ndifferent. The Spaniards had a hard position to attack, it is true,\r\nbut we could see them, and I knew exactly how to proceed. I kept on\r\nhorseback, merely because I found it difficult to convey orders along\r\nthe line, as the men were lying down; and it is always hard to get men\r\nto start when they cannot see whether their comrades are also going.\r\nSo I rode up and down the lines, keeping them straightened out, and\r\ngradually worked through line after line until I found myself at\r\nthe head of the regiment. By the time I had reached the lines of the\r\nregulars of the first brigade I had come to the conclusion that it was\r\nsilly to stay in the valley firing at the hills, because that was really\r\nwhere we were most exposed, and that the thing to do was to try to\r\nrush the intrenchments. Where I struck the regulars there was no one\r\nof superior rank to mine, and after asking why they did not charge, and\r\nbeing answered that they had no orders, I said I would give the order.\r\nThere was naturally a little reluctance shown by the elderly officer in\r\ncommand to accept my order, so I said, \"Then let my men through, sir,\"\r\nand I marched through, followed by my grinning men. The younger officers\r\nand the enlisted men of the regulars jumped up and joined us. I waved\r\nmy hat, and we went up the hill with a rush. Having taken it, we looked\r\nacross at the Spaniards in the trenches under the San Juan blockhouse to\r\nour left, which Hawkins's brigade was assaulting. I ordered our men to\r\nopen fire on the Spaniards in the trenches.\r\n\r\nMemory plays funny tricks in such a fight, where things happen quickly,\r\nand all kinds of mental images succeed one another in a detached kind\r\nof way, while the work goes on. As I gave the order in question there\r\nslipped through my mind Mahan's account of Nelson's orders that each\r\nship as it sailed forward, if it saw another ship engaged with an\r\nenemy's ship, should rake the latter as it passed. When Hawkins's\r\nsoldiers captured the blockhouse, I, very much elated, ordered a charge\r\non my own hook to a line of hills still farther on. Hardly anybody heard\r\nthis order, however; only four men started with me, three of whom were\r\nshot. I gave one of them, who was only wounded, my canteen of water, and\r\nran back, much irritated that I had not been followed--which was quite\r\nunjustifiable, because I found that nobody had heard my orders. General\r\nSumner had come up by this time, and I asked his permission to lead the\r\ncharge. He ordered me to do so, and this time away we went, and stormed\r\nthe Spanish intrenchments. There was some close fighting, and we took\r\na few prisoners. We also captured the Spanish provisions, and ate them\r\nthat night with great relish. One of the items was salted flying-fish,\r\nby the way. There were also bottles of wine, and jugs of fiery spirit,\r\nand as soon as possible I had these broken, although not before one\r\nor two of my men had taken too much liquor. Lieutenant Howze, of the\r\nregulars, an aide of General Sumner's, brought me an order to halt where\r\nI was; he could not make up his mind to return until he had spent an\r\nhour or two with us under fire. The Spaniards attempted a counter-attack\r\nin the middle of the afternoon, but were driven back without effort, our\r\nmen laughing and cheering as they rose to fire; because hitherto they\r\nhad been assaulting breastworks, or lying still under artillery fire,\r\nand they were glad to get a chance to shoot at the Spaniards in the\r\nopen. We lay on our arms that night and as we were drenched with sweat,\r\nand had no blankets save a few we took from the dead Spaniards, we found\r\neven the tropic night chilly before morning came.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon's fighting, while I was the highest officer at our\r\nimmediate part of the front, Captains Boughton and Morton of the regular\r\ncavalry, two as fine officers as any man could wish to have beside him\r\nin battle, came along the firing line to tell me that they had heard\r\na rumor that we might fall back, and that they wished to record their\r\nemphatic protest against any such course. I did not believe there was\r\nany truth in the rumor, for the Spaniards were utterly incapable of any\r\neffective counter-attack. However, late in the evening, after the fight,\r\nGeneral Wheeler visited us at the front, and he told me to keep myself\r\nin readiness, as at any moment it might be decided to fall back. Jack\r\nGreenway was beside me when General Wheeler was speaking. I answered,\r\n\"Well, General, I really don't know whether we would obey an order to\r\nfall back. We can take that city by a rush, and if we have to move\r\nout of here at all I should be inclined to make the rush in the right\r\ndirection.\" Greenway nodded an eager assent. The old General, after a\r\nmoment's pause, expressed his hearty agreement, and said that he would\r\nsee that there was no falling back. He had been very sick for a couple\r\nof days, but, sick as he was, he managed to get into the fight. He was a\r\ngamecock if ever there was one, but he was in very bad physical shape\r\non the day of the fight. If there had been any one in high command to\r\nsupervise and press the attack that afternoon, we would have gone\r\nright into Santiago. In my part of the line the advance was halted only\r\nbecause we received orders not to move forward, but to stay on the crest\r\nof the captured hill and hold it.\r\n\r\nWe are always told that three-o'clock-in-the-morning courage is the most\r\ndesirable kind. Well, my men and the regulars of the cavalry had just\r\nthat brand of courage. At about three o'clock on the morning after the\r\nfirst fight, shooting began in our front and there was an alarm of a\r\nSpanish advance. I was never more pleased than to see the way in which\r\nthe hungry, tired, shabby men all jumped up and ran forward to the\r\nhill-crest, so as to be ready for the attack; which, however, did not\r\ncome. As soon as the sun rose the Spaniards again opened upon us with\r\nartillery. A shell burst between Dave Goodrich and myself, blacking us\r\nwith powder, and killing and wounding several of the men immediately\r\nbehind us.\r\n\r\nNext day the fight turned into a siege; there were some stirring\r\nincidents; but for the most part it was trench work. A fortnight later\r\nSantiago surrendered. Wood won his brigadier-generalship by the capital\r\nway in which he handled his brigade in the fight, and in the following\r\nsiege. He was put in command of the captured city; and in a few days I\r\nsucceeded to the command of the brigade.\r\n\r\nThe health of the troops was not good, and speedily became very bad.\r\nThere was some dysentery, and a little yellow fever; but most of\r\nthe trouble was from a severe form of malarial fever. The Washington\r\nauthorities had behaved better than those in actual command of the\r\nexpedition at one crisis. Immediately after the first day's fighting\r\naround Santiago the latter had hinted by cable to Washington that they\r\nmight like to withdraw, and Washington had emphatically vetoed the\r\nproposal. I record this all the more gladly because there were not\r\ntoo many gleams of good sense shown in the home management of the war;\r\nalthough I wish to repeat that the real blame for this rested primarily\r\nwith us ourselves, the people of the United States, who had for years\r\npursued in military matters a policy that rendered it certain that there\r\nwould be ineptitude and failure in high places if ever a crisis came.\r\nAfter the siege the people in Washington showed no knowledge whatever\r\nof the conditions around Santiago, and proposed to keep the army there.\r\nThis would have meant that at least three-fourths of the men would\r\neither have died or have been permanently invalided, as a virulent form\r\nof malaria was widespread, and there was a steady growth of dysentery\r\nand other complaints. No object of any kind was to be gained by keeping\r\nthe army in or near the captured city. General Shafter tried his best to\r\nget the Washington authorities to order the army home. As he failed to\r\naccomplish anything, he called a council of the division and brigade\r\ncommanders and the chief medical officers to consult over the situation.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had command of a brigade, I was only a colonel, and so I\r\ndid not intend to attend, but the General informed me that I was\r\nparticularly wanted, and accordingly I went. At the council General\r\nShafter asked the medical authorities as to conditions, and they united\r\nin informing him that they were very bad, and were certain to grow\r\nmuch worse; and that in order to avoid frightful ravages from disease,\r\nchiefly due to malaria, the army should be sent back at once to some\r\npart of the northern United States. The General then explained that he\r\ncould not get the War Department to understand the situation; that he\r\ncould not get the attention of the public; and that he felt that there\r\nshould be some authoritative publication which would make the War\r\nDepartment take action before it was too late to avert the ruin of the\r\narmy. All who were in the room expressed their agreement.\r\n\r\nThen the reason for my being present came out. It was explained to me\r\nby General Shafter, and by others, that as I was a volunteer officer\r\nand intended immediately to return to civil life, I could afford to take\r\nrisks which the regular army men could not afford to take and ought\r\nnot to be expected to take, and that therefore I ought to make the\r\npublication in question; because to incur the hostility of the War\r\nDepartment would not make any difference to me, whereas it would be\r\ndestructive to the men in the regular army, or to those who hoped to\r\nget into the regular army. I thought this true, and said I would write\r\na letter or make a statement which could then be published.\r\nBrigadier-General Ames, who was in the same position that I was, also\r\nannounced that he would make a statement.\r\n\r\nWhen I left the meeting it was understood that I was to make my\r\nstatement as an interview in the press; but Wood, who was by that time\r\nBrigadier-General commanding the city of Santiago, gave me a quiet hint\r\nto put my statement in the form of a letter to General Shafter, and this\r\nI accordingly did. When I had written my letter, the correspondent\r\nof the Associated Press, who had been informed by others of what had\r\noccurred, accompanied me to General Shafter. I presented the letter to\r\nGeneral Shafter, who waved it away and said: \"I don't want to take it;\r\ndo whatever you wish with it.\" I, however, insisted on handing it to\r\nhim, whereupon he shoved it toward the correspondent of the Associated\r\nPress, who took hold of it, and I released my hold. General Ames made\r\na statement direct to the correspondent, and also sent a cable to the\r\nAssistant Secretary of the Navy at Washington, a copy of which he\r\ngave to the correspondent. By this time the other division and brigade\r\ncommanders who were present felt that they had better take action\r\nthemselves. They united in a round robin to General Shafter, which\r\nGeneral Wood dictated, and which was signed by Generals Kent, Gates,\r\nChaffee, Sumner, Ludlow, Ames, and Wood, and by myself. General Wood\r\nhanded this to General Shafter, and it was made public by General\r\nShafter precisely as mine was made public.[*] Later I was much amused\r\nwhen General Shafter stated that he could not imagine how my letter and\r\nthe round robin got out! When I saw this statement, I appreciated how\r\nwise Wood had been in hinting to me not to act on the suggestion of the\r\nGeneral that I should make a statement to the newspapers, but to put\r\nmy statement in the form of a letter to him as my superior officer, a\r\nletter which I delivered to him. Both the letter and the round robin\r\nwere written at General Shafter's wish, and at the unanimous suggestion\r\nof all the commanding and medical officers of the Fifth Army Corps, and\r\nboth were published by General Shafter.\r\n\r\n     [*] General Wood writes me: \"The representative of the\r\n     Associated Press was very anxious to get a copy of this\r\n     despatch or see it, and I told him it was impossible for him\r\n     to have it or see it. I then went in to General Shafter and\r\n     stated the case to him, handing him the despatch, saying,\r\n     'The matter is now in your hands.' He, General Shafter, then\r\n     said, 'I don't care whether this gentleman has it or not,'\r\n     and I left then. When I went back the General told me he had\r\n     given the Press representative a copy of the despatch, and\r\n     that he had gone to the office with it.\"\r\n\r\nIn a regiment the prime need is to have fighting men; the prime virtue\r\nis to be able and eager to fight with the utmost effectiveness. I have\r\nnever believed that this was incompatible with other virtues. On the\r\ncontrary, while there are of course exceptions, I believe that on the\r\naverage the best fighting men are also the best citizens. I do not\r\nbelieve that a finer set of natural soldiers than the men of my regiment\r\ncould have been found anywhere, and they were first-class citizens in\r\ncivil life also. One fact may perhaps be worthy of note. Whenever we\r\nwere in camp and so fixed that we could have regular meals, we used to\r\nhave a general officers' mess, over which I of course presided. During\r\nour entire service there was never a foul or indecent word uttered at\r\nthe officers' mess--I mean this literally; and there was very little\r\nswearing--although now and then in the fighting, if there was a moment\r\nwhen swearing seemed to be the best method of reaching the heart of the\r\nmatter, it was resorted to.\r\n\r\nThe men I cared for most in the regiment were the men who did the best\r\nwork; and therefore my liking for them was obliged to take the shape of\r\nexposing them to the most fatigue and hardship, of demanding from them\r\nthe greatest service, and of making them incur the greatest risk. Once\r\nI kept Greenway and Goodrich at work for forty-eight hours, without\r\nsleeping, and with very little food, fighting and digging trenches. I\r\nfreely sent the men for whom I cared most, to where death might smite\r\nthem; and death often smote them--as it did the two best officers in my\r\nregiment, Allyn Capron and Bucky O'Neil. My men would not have respected\r\nme had I acted otherwise. Their creed was my creed. The life even of the\r\nmost useful man, of the best citizen, is not to be hoarded if there be\r\nneed to spend it. I felt, and feel, this about others; and of course\r\nalso about myself. This is one reason why I have always felt impatient\r\ncontempt for the effort to abolish the death penalty on account of\r\nsympathy with criminals. I am willing to listen to arguments in favor of\r\nabolishing the death penalty so far as they are based purely on grounds\r\nof public expediency, although these arguments have never convinced me.\r\nBut inasmuch as, without hesitation, in the performance of duty, I have\r\nagain and again sent good and gallant and upright men to die, it seems\r\nto me the height of a folly both mischievous and mawkish to contend\r\nthat criminals who have deserved death should nevertheless be allowed\r\nto shirk it. No brave and good man can properly shirk death; and no\r\ncriminal who has earned death should be allowed to shirk it.\r\n\r\nOne of the best men with our regiment was the British military attache,\r\nCaptain Arthur Lee, an old friend. The other military attaches were\r\nherded together at headquarters and saw little. Captain Lee, who had\r\nknown me in Washington, escaped and stayed with the regiment. We grew to\r\nfeel that he was one of us, and made him an honorary member. There were\r\ntwo other honorary members. One was Richard Harding Davis, who was with\r\nus continually and who performed valuable service on the fighting line.\r\nThe other was a regular officer, Lieutenant Parker, who had a battery\r\nof gatlings. We were with this battery throughout the San Juan fighting,\r\nand we grew to have the strongest admiration for Parker as a soldier and\r\nthe strongest liking for him as a man. During our brief campaign we were\r\nclosely and intimately thrown with various regular officers of the type\r\nof Mills, Howze, and Parker. We felt not merely fondness for them as\r\nofficers and gentlemen, but pride in them as Americans. It is a\r\nfine thing to feel that we have in the army and in the navy modest,\r\nefficient, gallant gentlemen of this type, doing such disinterested work\r\nfor the honor of the flag and of the Nation. No American can overpay the\r\ndebt of gratitude we all of us owe to the officers and enlisted men of\r\nthe army and of the navy.\r\n\r\nOf course with a regiment of our type there was much to learn both among\r\nthe officers and the men. There were all kinds of funny incidents. One\r\nof my men, an ex-cow-puncher and former round-up cook, a very good\r\nshot and rider, got into trouble on the way down on the transport.\r\nHe understood entirely that he had to obey the officers of his own\r\nregiment, but, like so many volunteers, or at least like so many\r\nvolunteers of my regiment, he did not understand that this obligation\r\nextended to officers of other regiments. One of the regular officers on\r\nthe transport ordered him to do something which he declined to do. When\r\nthe officer told him to consider himself under arrest, he responded\r\nby offering to fight him for a trifling consideration. He was brought\r\nbefore a court martial which sentenced him to a year's imprisonment at\r\nhard labor with dishonorable discharge, and the major-general commanding\r\nthe division approved the sentence.\r\n\r\nWe were on the transport. There was no hard labor to do; and the prison\r\nconsisted of another cow-puncher who kept guard over him with his\r\ncarbine, evidently divided in his feelings as to whether he would like\r\nmost to shoot him or to let him go. When we landed, somebody told the\r\nprisoner that I intended to punish him by keeping him with the baggage.\r\nHe at once came to me in great agitation, saying: \"Colonel, they say\r\nyou're going to leave me with the baggage when the fight is on. Colonel,\r\nif you do that, I will never show my face in Arizona again. Colonel, if\r\nyou will let me go to the front, I promise I will obey any one you say;\r\nany one you say, Colonel,\" with the evident feeling that, after this\r\nconcession, I could not, as a gentleman, refuse his request. Accordingly\r\nI answered: \"Shields, there is no one in this regiment more entitled to\r\nbe shot than you are, and you shall go to the front.\" His gratitude was\r\ngreat, and he kept repeating, \"I'll never forget this, Colonel, never.\"\r\nNor did he. When we got very hard up, he would now and then manage to\r\nget hold of some flour and sugar, and would cook a doughnut and bring it\r\nround to me, and watch me with a delighted smile as I ate it. He behaved\r\nextremely well in both fights, and after the second one I had him\r\nformally before me and remitted his sentence--something which of course\r\nI had not the slightest power to do, although at the time it seemed\r\nnatural and proper to me.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to be mustered out, the regular officer who was doing the\r\nmustering, after all the men had been discharged, finally asked me where\r\nthe prisoner was. I said, \"What prisoner?\" He said, \"The prisoner,\r\nthe man who was sentenced to a year's imprisonment with hard labor\r\nand dishonorable discharge.\" I said, \"Oh! I pardoned him\"; to which he\r\nresponded, \"I beg your pardon; you did what?\" This made me grasp the\r\nfact that I had exceeded authority, and I could only answer, \"Well, I\r\ndid pardon him, anyhow, and he has gone with the rest\"; whereupon the\r\nmustering-out officer sank back in his chair and remarked, \"He was\r\nsentenced by a court martial, and the sentence was approved by the\r\nmajor-general commanding the division. You were a lieutenant-colonel,\r\nand you pardoned him. Well, it was nervy, that's all I'll say.\"\r\n\r\nThe simple fact was that under the circumstances it was necessary for me\r\nto enforce discipline and control the regiment, and therefore to reward\r\nand punish individuals in whatever way the exigencies demanded. I often\r\nexplained to the men what the reasons for an order were, the first time\r\nit was issued, if there was any trouble on their part in understanding\r\nwhat they were required to do. They were very intelligent and very eager\r\nto do their duty, and I hardly ever had any difficulty the second time\r\nwith them. If, however, there was the slightest willful shirking of duty\r\nor insubordination, I punished instantly and mercilessly, and the whole\r\nregiment cordially backed me up. To have punished men for faults and\r\nshortcomings which they had no opportunity to know were such would have\r\nbeen as unwise as to have permitted any of the occasional bad characters\r\nto exercise the slightest license. It was a regiment which was sensitive\r\nabout its dignity and was very keenly alive to justice and to courtesy,\r\nbut which cordially approved absence of mollycoddling, insistence upon\r\nthe performance of duty, and summary punishment of wrong-doing.\r\n\r\nIn the final fighting at San Juan, when we captured one of the trenches,\r\nJack Greenway had seized a Spaniard, and shortly afterwards I found Jack\r\nleading his captive round with a string. I told him to turn him over to\r\na man who had two or three other captives, so that they should all be\r\ntaken to the rear. It was the only time I ever saw Jack look aggrieved.\r\n\"Why, Colonel, can't I keep him for myself?\" he asked, plaintively. I\r\nthink he had an idea that as a trophy of his bow and spear the Spaniard\r\nwould make a fine body servant.\r\n\r\nOne reason that we never had the slightest trouble in the regiment was\r\nbecause, when we got down to hard pan, officers and men shared exactly\r\nalike. It is all right to have differences in food and the like in times\r\nof peace and plenty, when everybody is comfortable. But in really hard\r\ntimes officers and men must share alike if the best work is to be done.\r\nAs long as I had nothing but two hardtacks, which was the allowance to\r\neach man on the morning after the San Juan fight, no one could complain;\r\nbut if I had had any private little luxuries the men would very\r\nnaturally have realized keenly their own shortages.\r\n\r\nSoon after the Guasimas fight we were put on short commons; and as I\r\nknew that a good deal of food had been landed and was on the beach at\r\nSiboney, I marched thirty or forty of the men down to see if I could not\r\nget some and bring it up. I finally found a commissary officer, and he\r\nasked me what I wanted, and I answered, anything he had. So he told me\r\nto look about for myself. I found a number of sacks of beans, I think\r\nabout eleven hundred pounds, on the beach; and told the officer that\r\nI wanted eleven hundred pounds of beans. He produced a book of\r\nregulations, and showed me the appropriate section and subdivision which\r\nannounced that beans were issued only for the officers' mess. This did\r\nme no good, and I told him so. He said he was sorry, and I answered that\r\nhe was not as sorry as I was. I then \"studied on it,\" as Br'r Rabbit\r\nwould say, and came back with a request for eleven hundred pounds of\r\nbeans for the officers' mess. He said, \"Why, Colonel, your officers\r\ncan't eat eleven hundred pounds of beans,\" to which I responded, \"You\r\ndon't know what appetites my officers have.\" He then said he would send\r\nthe requisition to Washington. I told him I was quite willing, so long\r\nas he gave me the beans. He was a good fellow, so we finally effected a\r\nworking compromise--he got the requisition and I got the beans, although\r\nhe warned me that the price would probably be deducted from my salary.\r\n\r\nUnder some regulation or other only the regular supply trains were\r\nallowed to act, and we were supposed not to have any horses or mules in\r\nthe regiment itself. This was very pretty in theory; but, as a matter of\r\nfact, the supply trains were not numerous enough. My men had a natural\r\ngenius for acquiring horseflesh in odd ways, and I continually found\r\nthat they had staked out in the brush various captured Spanish cavalry\r\nhorses and Cuban ponies and abandoned commissary mules. Putting these\r\ntogether, I would organize a small pack train and work it industriously\r\nfor a day or two, until they learned about it at headquarters and\r\nconfiscated it. Then I would have to wait for a week or so until my\r\nmen had accumulated some more ponies, horses, and mules, the regiment\r\nmeanwhile living in plenty on what we had got before the train was\r\nconfiscated.\r\n\r\nAll of our men were good at accumulating horses, but within our own\r\nranks I think we were inclined to award the palm to our chaplain. There\r\nwas not a better man in the regiment than the chaplain, and there could\r\nnot have been a better chaplain for our men. He took care of the sick\r\nand the wounded, he never spared himself, and he did every duty. In\r\naddition, he had a natural aptitude for acquiring mules, which made some\r\nadmirer, when the regiment was disbanded, propose that we should have a\r\nspecial medal struck for him, with, on the obverse, \"A Mule passant and\r\nChaplain regardant.\" After the surrender of Santiago, a Philadelphia\r\nclergyman whom I knew came down to General Wheeler's headquarters,\r\nand after visiting him announced that he intended to call on the Rough\r\nRiders, because he knew their colonel. One of General Wheeler's aides,\r\nLieutenant Steele, who liked us both individually and as a regiment,\r\nand who appreciated some of our ways, asked the clergyman, after he\r\nhad announced that he knew Colonel Roosevelt, \"But do you know Colonel\r\nRoosevelt's regiment?\" \"No,\" said the clergyman. \"Very well, then, let\r\nme give you a piece of advice. When you go down to see the Colonel,\r\ndon't let your horse out of your sight; and if the chaplain is there,\r\ndon't get off the horse!\"\r\n\r\nWe came back to Montauk Point and soon after were disbanded. We had been\r\nin the service only a little over four months. There are no four months\r\nof my life to which I look back with more pride and satisfaction. I\r\nbelieve most earnestly and sincerely in peace, but as things are yet in\r\nthis world the nation that cannot fight, the people that have lost the\r\nfighting edge, that have lost the virile virtues, occupy a position as\r\ndangerous as it is ignoble. The future greatness of America in no small\r\ndegree depends upon the possession by the average American citizen of\r\nthe qualities which my men showed when they served under me at Santiago.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is one thing in connection with this war which it is\r\nwell that our people should remember, our people who genuinely love the\r\npeace of righteousness, the peace of justice--and I would be ashamed to\r\nbe other than a lover of the peace of righteousness and of justice. The\r\ntrue preachers of peace, who strive earnestly to bring nearer the\r\nday when peace shall obtain among all peoples, and who really do help\r\nforward the cause, are men who never hesitate to choose righteous war\r\nwhen it is the only alternative to unrighteous peace. These are the men\r\nwho, like Dr. Lyman Abbott, have backed every genuine movement for peace\r\nin this country, and who nevertheless recognized our clear duty to war\r\nfor the freedom of Cuba.\r\n\r\nBut there are other men who put peace ahead of righteousness, and who\r\ncare so little for facts that they treat fantastic declarations\r\nfor immediate universal arbitration as being valuable, instead of\r\ndetrimental, to the cause they profess to champion, and who seek to make\r\nthe United States impotent for international good under the pretense of\r\nmaking us impotent for international evil. All the men of this kind, and\r\nall of the organizations they have controlled, since we began our career\r\nas a nation, all put together, have not accomplished one hundredth part\r\nas much for both peace and righteousness, have not done one hundredth\r\npart as much either for ourselves or for other peoples, as was\r\naccomplished by the people of the United States when they fought the war\r\nwith Spain and with resolute good faith and common sense worked out the\r\nsolution of the problems which sprang from the war.\r\n\r\nOur army and navy, and above all our people, learned some lessons from\r\nthe Spanish War, and applied them to our own uses. During the following\r\ndecade the improvement in our navy and army was very great; not in\r\nmaterial only, but also in personnel, and, above all, in the ability to\r\nhandle our forces in good-sized units. By 1908, when our battle fleet\r\nsteamed round the world, the navy had become in every respect as fit\r\na fighting instrument as any other navy in the world, fleet for fleet.\r\nEven in size there was but one nation, England, which was completely\r\nout of our class; and in view of our relations with England and all the\r\nEnglish-speaking peoples, this was of no consequence. Of our army,\r\nof course, as much could not be said. Nevertheless the improvement in\r\nefficiency was marked. Our artillery was still very inferior in training\r\nand practice to the artillery arm of any one of the great Powers such\r\nas Germany, France, or Japan--a condition which we only then began\r\nto remedy. But the workmanlike speed and efficiency with which the\r\nexpedition of some 6000 troops of all arms was mobilized and transported\r\nto Cuba during the revolution of 1908 showed that, as regards our\r\ncavalry and infantry, we had at least reached the point where we could\r\nassemble and handle in first-rate fashion expeditionary forces. This is\r\nmighty little to boast of, for a Nation of our wealth and population;\r\nit is not pleasant to compare it with the extraordinary feats of\r\ncontemporary Japan and the Balkan peoples; but, such as it is, it\r\nrepresents a long stride in advance over conditions as they were in\r\n1898.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A\r\n\r\nA MANLY LETTER\r\n\r\nThere was a sequel to the \"round robin\" incident which caused a little\r\nstir at the moment; Secretary Alger had asked me to write him freely\r\nfrom time to time. Accordingly, after the surrender of Santiago, I wrote\r\nhim begging that the cavalry division might be put into the Porto Rican\r\nfighting, preparatory to what we supposed would be the big campaign\r\nagainst Havana in the fall. In the letter I extolled the merits of the\r\nRough Riders and of the Regulars, announcing with much complacency that\r\neach of our regiments was worth \"three of the National Guard regiments,\r\narmed with their archaic black powder rifles.\"[*] Secretary Alger\r\nbelieved, mistakenly, that I had made public the round robin, and\r\nwas naturally irritated, and I suddenly received from him a published\r\ntelegram, not alluding to the round robin incident, but quoting my\r\nreference to the comparative merits of the cavalry regiments and the\r\nNational Guard regiments and rebuking me for it. The publication of the\r\nextract from my letter was not calculated to help me secure the votes of\r\nthe National Guard if I ever became a candidate for office. However, I\r\ndid not mind the matter much, for I had at the time no idea of being\r\na candidate for anything--while in the campaign I ate and drank and\r\nthought and dreamed regiment and nothing but regiment, until I got the\r\nbrigade, and then I devoted all my thoughts to handling the brigade.\r\nAnyhow, there was nothing I could do about the matter.\r\n\r\n     [*] I quote this sentence from memory; it is substantially\r\n     correct.\r\n\r\nWhen our transport reached Montauk Point, an army officer came aboard\r\nand before doing anything else handed me a sealed letter from the\r\nSecretary of War which ran as follows:--\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON,\r\n\r\nAugust 10, 1898.\r\n\r\nDEAR COL. ROOSEVELT:\r\n\r\nYou have been a most gallant officer and in the battle before Santiago\r\nshowed superb soldierly qualities. I would rather add to, than detract\r\nfrom, the honors you have so fairly won, and I wish you all good things.\r\nIn a moment of aggravation under great stress of feeling, first because\r\nI thought you spoke in a disparaging manner of the volunteers (probably\r\nwithout intent, but because of your great enthusiasm for your own men)\r\nand second that I believed your published letter would embarrass the\r\nDepartment I sent you a telegram which with an extract from a private\r\nletter of yours I gave to the press. I would gladly recall both if I\r\ncould, but unable to do that I write you this letter which I hope you\r\nwill receive in the same friendly spirit in which I send it. Come and\r\nsee me at a very early day. No one will welcome you more heartily than\r\nI.\r\n\r\nYours very truly, (Signed) R. A. ALGER.\r\n\r\nI thought this a manly letter, and paid no more heed to the incident;\r\nand when I was President, and General Alger was Senator from Michigan,\r\nhe was my stanch friend and on most matters my supporter.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B\r\n\r\nTHE SAN JUAN FIGHT\r\n\r\nThe San Juan fight took its name from the San Juan Hill or hills--I do\r\nnot know whether the name properly belonged to a line of hills or to\r\nonly one hill.\r\n\r\nTo compare small things with large things, this was precisely as the\r\nBattle of Gettysburg took its name from the village of Gettysburg, where\r\nonly a small part of the fighting was done; and the battle of Waterloo\r\nfrom the village of Waterloo, where none of the fighting was done.\r\nWhen it became the political interest of certain people to endeavor to\r\nminimize my part in the Santiago fighting (which was merely like that of\r\nvarious other squadron, battalion and regimental commanders) some of my\r\nopponents laid great stress on the alleged fact that the cavalry did not\r\ncharge up San Juan Hill. We certainly charged some hills; but I did not\r\nask their names before charging them. To say that the Rough Riders and\r\nthe cavalry division, and among other people myself, were not in the\r\nSan Juan fight is precisely like saying that the men who made Pickett's\r\nCharge, or the men who fought at Little Round Top and Culps Hill, were\r\nnot at Gettysburg; or that Picton and the Scotch Greys and the French\r\nand English guards were not at Waterloo. The present Vice-President of\r\nthe United States in the campaign last year was reported in the press\r\nas repeatedly saying that I was not in the San Juan fight. The documents\r\nfollowing herewith have been printed for many years, and were accessible\r\nto him had he cared to know or to tell the truth.\r\n\r\nThese documents speak for themselves. The first is the official report\r\nissued by the War Department. From this it will be seen that there\r\nwere in the Santiago fighting thirty infantry and cavalry regiments\r\nrepresented. Six of these were volunteer, of which one was the Rough\r\nRiders. The other twenty-four were regular regiments. The percentage of\r\nloss of our regiment was about seven times as great as that of the\r\nother five volunteer regiments. Of the twenty-four regular regiments,\r\ntwenty-two suffered a smaller percentage of loss than we suffered.\r\nTwo, the Sixth United States Infantry and the Thirteenth United States\r\nInfantry, suffered a slightly greater percentage of loss--twenty-six per\r\ncent and twenty-three per cent as against twenty-two per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOMINATIONS BY THE PRESIDENT\r\n\r\nTo be Colonel by Brevet\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Theodore Roosevelt, First Volunteer Cavalry, for\r\ngallantry in battle, Las Guasima, Cuba, June 24, 1898.\r\n\r\nTo be Brigadier-General by Brevet\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Theodore Roosevelt, First Volunteer Cavalry, for\r\ngallantry in battle, Santiago de Cuba, July 1, 1898.

(Through\r\nmilitary channels)\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to invite attention to the following list of\r\nofficers and enlisted men who specially distinguished themselves in the\r\naction at Las Guasimas, Cuba, June 24, 1898.\r\n\r\nThese officers and men have been recommended for favorable consideration\r\nby their immediate commanding officers in their respective reports, and\r\nI would respectfully urge that favorable action be taken.\r\n\r\nOFFICERS\r\n\r\n. . . . .\r\n\r\nIn First United States Volunteer Cavalry--Colonel Leonard Wood,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nRespectfully, JOSEPH WHEELER, Major-General United States Volunteers,\r\nCommanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY BRIGADE, CAMP NEAR SANTIAGO DE CUBA, CUBA,\r\nJune 29, 1898.\r\n\r\nTHE ADJUTANT-GENERAL CAVALRY DIVISION.\r\n\r\nSIR: By direction of the major-general commanding the Cavalry Division,\r\nI have the honor to submit the following report of the engagement of\r\na part of this brigade with the enemy at Guasimas, Cuba, on June 24th,\r\naccompanied by detailed reports from the regimental and other commanders\r\nengaged, and a list of the killed and wounded:\r\n\r\n. . . . .\r\n\r\nI cannot speak too highly of the efficient manner in which Colonel Wood\r\nhandled his regiment, and of his magnificent behavior on the field. The\r\nconduct of Lieutenant-Colonel Roosevelt, as reported to me by my\r\ntwo aides, deserves my highest commendation. Both Colonel Wood and\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Roosevelt disdained to take advantage of shelter or\r\ncover from the enemy's fire while any of their men remained exposed to\r\nit--an error of judgment, but happily on the heroic side.\r\n\r\n. . . . .\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, S. B. M. YOUNG, Brigadier General United States\r\nVolunteers, Commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION SECOND ARMY CORPS CAMP MACKENZIE, GA.,\r\nDecember 30, 1898.\r\n\r\nADJUTANT-GENERAL, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to recommend Hon. Theodore Roosevelt, late Colonel\r\nFirst United States Volunteer Cavalry, for a medal of honor, as a reward\r\nfor conspicuous gallantry at the battle of San Juan, Cuba, on July 1,\r\n1898.\r\n\r\nColonel Roosevelt by his example and fearlessness inspired his men, and\r\nboth at Kettle Hill and the ridge known as San Juan he led his command\r\nin person. I was an eye-witness of Colonel Roosevelt's action.\r\n\r\nAs Colonel Roosevelt has left the service, a Brevet Commission is of no\r\nparticular value in his case.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, SAMUEL S. SUMNER, Major-General United States\r\nVolunteers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST POINT, N. Y., December 17, 1898.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COLONEL: I saw you lead the line up the first hill--you were\r\ncertainly the first officer to reach the top--and through your efforts,\r\nand your personally jumping to the front, a line more or less thin, but\r\nstrong enough to take it, was led by you to the San Juan or first hill.\r\nIn this your life was placed in extreme jeopardy, as you may recall,\r\nand as it proved by the number of dead left in that vicinity. Captain\r\nStevens, then of the Ninth Cavalry, now of the Second Cavalry, was\r\nwith you, and I am sure he recalls your gallant conduct. After the line\r\nstarted on the advance from the first hill, I did not see you until our\r\nline was halted, under a most galling fire, at the extreme front, where\r\nyou afterwards entrenched. I spoke to you there and gave instructions\r\nfrom General Sumner that the position was to be held and that there\r\nwould be no further advance till further orders. You were the senior\r\nofficer there, took charge of the line, scolded me for having my horse\r\nso high upon the ridge; at the same time you were exposing yourself most\r\nconspicuously, while adjusting the line, for the example was necessary,\r\nas was proved when several colored soldiers--about eight or ten,\r\nTwenty-fourth Infantry, I think--started at a run to the rear to assist\r\na wounded colored soldier, and you drew your revolver and put a short\r\nand effective stop to such apparent stampede--it quieted them. That\r\nposition was hot, and now I marvel at your escaping there. . . . Very\r\nsincerely yours, ROBERT L. HOWZE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST POINT, N. Y., December 17, 1898.\r\n\r\nI hereby certify that on July 1, 1898, Colonel (then Lieutenant-Colonel)\r\nTheodore Roosevelt, First Volunteer Cavalry, distinguished himself\r\nthrough the action, and on two occasions during the battle when I was an\r\neye-witness, his conduct was most conspicuous and clearly distinguished\r\nabove other men, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. At the base of San Juan, or first hill, there was a strong wire\r\nfence, or entanglement, at which the line hesitated under a galling\r\nfire, and where the losses were severe. Colonel Roosevelt jumped through\r\nthe fence and by his enthusiasm, his example and courage succeeded in\r\nleading to the crest of the hill a line sufficiently strong to capture\r\nit. In this charge the Cavalry Brigade suffered its greatest loss,\r\nand the Colonel's life was placed in extreme jeopardy, owing to the\r\nconspicuous position he took in leading the line, and being the first\r\nto reach the crest of that hill, while under heavy fire of the enemy at\r\nclose range.\r\n\r\n2. At the extreme advanced position occupied by our lines, Colonel\r\nRoosevelt found himself the senior, and under his instructions from\r\nGeneral Sumner to hold that position. He displayed the greatest bravery\r\nand placed his life in extreme jeopardy by unavoidable exposure to\r\nsevere fire while adjusting and strengthening the line, placing the men\r\nin positions which afforded best protection, etc., etc. His conduct\r\nand example steadied the men, and on one occasion by severe but not\r\nunnecessary measures prevented a small detachment from stampeding to the\r\nrear. He displayed the most conspicuous gallantry, courage and coolness,\r\nin performing extraordinarily hazardous duty.\r\n\r\nROBERT L. HOWZE, Captain A. A. G., U. S. V. (First Lieutenant Sixth\r\nUnited States Cavalry.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE ADJUTANT-GENERAL UNITED STATES ARMY, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES MILITARY ACADEMY, WEST POINT, N. Y., April 5,\r\n1899.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT-COLONEL W. H. CARTER, Assistant Adjutant-General United\r\nStates Army, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nSIR: In compliance with the request, contained in your letter of April\r\n30th, of the Board convened to consider the awarding of brevets, medals\r\nof honor, etc., for the Santiago Campaign, that I state any facts,\r\nwithin my knowledge as Adjutant-General of the Brigade in which\r\nColonel Theodore Roosevelt served, to aid the Board in determining, in\r\nconnection with Colonel Roosevelt's application for a medal of honor,\r\nwhether his conduct at Santiago was such as to distinguish him above\r\nothers, I have the honor to submit the following:\r\n\r\nMy duties on July 1, 1898, brought me in constant observation of and\r\ncontact with Colonel Roosevelt from early morning until shortly before\r\nthe climax of the assault of the Cavalry Division on the San Juan\r\nHill--the so-called Kettle Hill. During this time, while under the\r\nenemy's artillery fire at El Poso, and while on the march from El Poso\r\nby the San Juan ford to the point from which his regiment moved to the\r\nassault--about two miles, the greater part under fire--Colonel Roosevelt\r\nwas conspicuous above any others I observed in his regiment in the\r\nzealous performance of duty, in total disregard of his personal danger\r\nand in his eagerness to meet the enemy. At El Poso, when the enemy\r\nopened on that place with artillery fire, a shrapnel bullet grazed and\r\nbruised one of Colonel Roosevelt's wrists. The incident did not lessen\r\nhis hazardous exposure, but he continued so exposed until he had placed\r\nhis command under cover. In moving to the assault of San Juan Hill,\r\nColonel Roosevelt was most conspicuously brave, gallant and indifferent\r\nto his own safety. He, in the open, led his regiment; no officer\r\ncould have set a more striking example to his men or displayed greater\r\nintrepidity.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, Your obedient servant, A. L. MILLS, Colonel United\r\nStates Army, Superintendent.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF SANTIAGO DE CUBA, SANTIAGO DE CUBA, December\r\n30, 1898.\r\n\r\nTO THE ADJUTANT-GENERAL, UNITED STATES ARMY, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to make the following statement relative to\r\nthe conduct of Colonel Theodore Roosevelt, late First United States\r\nVolunteer Cavalry, during the assault upon San Juan Hill, July 1, 1898.\r\n\r\nI have already recommended this officer for a medal of honor, which I\r\nunderstand has been denied him, upon the ground that my previous letter\r\nwas too indefinite. I based my recommendation upon the fact that Colonel\r\nRoosevelt, accompanied only by four or five men, led a very desperate\r\nand extremely gallant charge on San Juan Hill, thereby setting a\r\nsplendid example to the troops and encouraging them to pass over the\r\nopen country intervening between their position and the trenches of the\r\nenemy. In leading this charge, he started off first, as he supposed,\r\nwith quite a following of men, but soon discovered that he was alone. He\r\nthen returned and gathered up a few men and led them to the charge, as\r\nabove stated. The charge in itself was an extremely gallant one, and the\r\nexample set a most inspiring one to the troops in that part of the line,\r\nand while it is perfectly true that everybody finally went up the hill\r\nin good style, yet there is no doubt that the magnificent example set by\r\nColonel Roosevelt had a very encouraging effect and had great weight in\r\nbringing up the troops behind him. During the assault, Colonel Roosevelt\r\nwas the first to reach the trenches in his part of the line and killed\r\none of the enemy with his own hand.\r\n\r\nI earnestly recommend that the medal be conferred upon Colonel\r\nRoosevelt, for I believe that he in every way deserves it, and that\r\nhis services on the day in question were of great value and of a most\r\ndistinguished character.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, LEONARD WOOD, Major-General, United States\r\nVolunteers. Commanding Department of Santiago de Cuba.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNTSVILLE, ALA., January 4, 1899.\r\n\r\nTHE ADJUTANT-GENERAL, UNITED STATES ARMY, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to recommend that a \"Congressional Medal of Honor\"\r\nbe given to Theodore Roosevelt (late Colonel First Volunteer Cavalry),\r\nfor distinguished conduct and conspicuous bravery in command of his\r\nregiment in the charge on San Juan Hill, Cuba, July 1, 1898.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with G. O. 135, A. G. O. 1898, I enclose my certificate\r\nshowing my personal knowledge of Colonel Roosevelt's conduct.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, C. J. STEVENS, Captain Second Cavalry.\r\n\r\nI hereby certify that on July 1, 1898, at the battle of San Juan, Cuba,\r\nI witnessed Colonel (then Lieutenant-Colonel) Roosevelt, First Volunteer\r\nCavalry, United States of America, mounted, leading his regiment in\r\nthe charge on San Juan. By his gallantry and strong personality he\r\ncontributed most materially to the success of the charge of the Cavalry\r\nDivision up San Juan Hill.\r\n\r\nColonel Roosevelt was among the first to reach the crest of the hill,\r\nand his dashing example, his absolute fearlessness and gallant leading\r\nrendered his conduct conspicuous and clearl distinguished above other\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nC. J. STEVENS, Captain Second Cavalry. (Late First Lieutenant Ninth\r\nCavalry.)\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUNG'S ISLAND, S. C., December 28, 1898.\r\n\r\nTO THE ADJUTANT-GENERAL, UNITED STATES ARMY. Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nSIR: Believing that information relating to superior conduct on the part\r\nof any of the higher officers who participated in the Spanish-American\r\nWar (and which information may not have been given) would be appreciated\r\nby the Department over which you preside, I have the honor to call your\r\nattention to the part borne by Colonel Theodore Roosevelt, of the late\r\nFirst United States Volunteer Cavalry, in the battle of July 1st last.\r\nI do this not only because I think you ought to know, but because his\r\nregiment as a whole were very proud of his splendid actions that day\r\nand believe they call for that most coveted distinction of the American\r\nofficer, the Medal of Honor. Held in support, he brought his regiment,\r\nat exactly the right time, not only up to the line of regulars, but went\r\nthrough them and headed, on horseback, the charge on Kettle Hill; this\r\nbeing done on his own initiative, the regulars as well as his own men\r\nfollowing. He then headed the charge on the next hill, both regulars and\r\nthe First United States Volunteer Cavalry following. He was so near\r\nthe intrenchments on the second hill, that he shot and killed with a\r\nrevolver one of the enemy before they broke completely. He then led the\r\ncavalry on the chain of hills overlooking Santiago, where he remained in\r\ncharge of all the cavalry that was at the extreme front for the rest of\r\nthat day and night. His unhesitating gallantry in taking the initiative\r\nagainst intrenchments lined by men armed with rapid fire guns certainly\r\nwon him the highest consideration and admiration of all who witnessed\r\nhis conduct throughout that day.\r\n\r\nWhat I here write I can bear witness to from personally having seen.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, M. J. JENKINS, Major Late First United States\r\nCavalry.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESCOTT, A. T., December 25, 1898.\r\n\r\nI was Colonel Roosevelt's orderly at the battle of San Juan Hill, and\r\nfrom that time on until our return to Montauk Point. I was with him all\r\nthrough the fighting, and believe I was the only man who was always with\r\nhim, though during part of the time Lieutenants Ferguson and Greenwald\r\nwere also close to him. He led our regiment forward on horseback until\r\nhe came to the men of the Ninth Cavalry lying down. He led us through\r\nthese and they got up and joined us. He gave the order to charge on\r\nKettle Hill, and led us on horseback up the hill, both Rough Riders and\r\nthe Ninth Cavalry. He was the first on the hill, I being very nearly\r\nalongside of him. Some Spanish riflemen were coming out of the\r\nintrenchments and he killed one with his revolver. He took the men on\r\nto the crest of the hill and bade them begin firing on the blockhouse on\r\nthe hill to our left, the one the infantry were attacking. When he\r\ntook it, he gave the order to charge, and led the troops on Kettle Hill\r\nforward against the blockhouse on our front. He then had charge of all\r\nthe cavalry on the hills overlooking Santiago, where we afterwards dug\r\nour trenches. He had command that afternoon and night, and for the rest\r\nof the time commanded our regiment at this point.\r\n\r\nYours very truly, H. P. BARDSHAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, MD., March 27, 1902.\r\n\r\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT, President of the United States. Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: At your request, I send you the following extracts from my\r\ndiary, and from notes taken on the day of the assault on San Juan. I\r\nkept in my pocket a small pad on which incidents were noted daily from\r\nthe landing until the surrender. On the day of the fight notes were\r\ntaken just before Grimes fired his first gun, just after the third reply\r\nfrom the enemy--when we were massed in the road about seventy paces\r\nfrom Grimes' guns, and when I was beginning to get scared and to think\r\nI would be killed--at the halt just before you advanced, and under the\r\nshelter of the hills in the evening. Each time that notes were taken,\r\nthe page was put in an envelope addressed to my wife. At the first\r\nchance they were mailed to her, and on my arrival in the United States\r\nthe story of the fight, taken from these notes, was entered in the diary\r\nI keep in a book. I make this lengthy explanation that you may see that\r\neverything put down was fresh in my memory.\r\n\r\nI quote from my diary: \"The tension on the men was great. Suddenly a\r\nline of men appeared coming from our right. They were advancing through\r\nthe long grass, deployed as skirmishers and were under fire. At\r\ntheir head, or rather in front of them and leading them, rode Colonel\r\nRoosevelt. He was very conspicuous, mounted as he was. The men were the\r\n'Rough Riders,' so-called. I heard some one calling to them not to fire\r\ninto us, and seeing Colonel Carrol, reported to him, and was told to go\r\nout and meet them, and caution them as to our position, we being between\r\nthem and the enemy. I did so, speaking to Colonel Roosevelt. I also\r\ntold him we were under orders not to advance, and asked him if he had\r\nreceived any orders. He replied that he was going to charge the Spanish\r\ntrenches. I told this to Colonel Carrol, and to Captain Dimmick, our\r\nsquadron commander. A few moments after the word passed down that our\r\nleft (Captain Taylor) was about to charge. Captain McBlain called out,\r\n'we must go in with those troops; we must support Taylor.' I called this\r\nto Captain Dimmick, and he gave the order to assault.\"\r\n\r\n\"The cheer was taken up and taken up again, on the left, and in the\r\ndistance it rolled on and on. And so we started. Colonel Roosevelt, of\r\nthe Rough Riders, started the whole movement on the left, which was the\r\nfirst advance of the assault.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is taken from my notes and was hastily jotted down on the\r\nfield: \"The Rough Riders came in line--Colonel Roosevelt said he would\r\nassault--Taylor joined them with his troop--McBlain called to Dimmick,\r\n'let us go, we must go to support them.' Dimmick said all right--and so,\r\nwith no orders, we went in.\"\r\n\r\nI find many of my notes are illegible from perspiration. My authority\r\nfor saying Taylor went in with you, \"joined with his troop\" was the word\r\npassed to me and repeated to Captain Dimmick that Taylor was about to\r\ncharge with you. I could not see his troop. I have not put it in my\r\ndiary, but in another place I have noted that Colonel Carrol, who was\r\nacting as brigade commander, told me to ask you if you had any orders.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, Very respectfully, Your obedient servant,\r\nHENRY ANSON BARBER, Captain Twenty-Eighth Infantry, (formerly of Ninth\r\nCavalry.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS PACIFIC DIVISION, SAN FRANCISCO, CAL., May 11, 1905.\r\n\r\nDEAR MR. PRESIDENT: As some discussion has arisen in the public prints\r\nregarding the battle of San Juan, Cuba, July 1, 1898, and your personal\r\nmovements during that day have been the subject of comment, it may not\r\nbe amiss in me to state some facts coming under my personal observation\r\nas Commanding General of the Cavalry Division of which your regiment\r\nformed a part. It will, perhaps, be advisable to show first how I came\r\nto be in command, in order that my statement may have due weight as an\r\nauthoritative statement of facts: I was placed in command of the\r\nCavalry Division on the afternoon of June 30th by General Shafter; the\r\nassignment was made owing to the severe illness of General Wheeler, who\r\nwas the permanent commander of said Division. Brigadier General Young,\r\nwho commanded the Second Cavalry Brigade, of which your regiment--the\r\nFirst Volunteer Cavalry--formed a part, was also very ill, and I found\r\nit necessary to relieve him from command and place Colonel Wood, of\r\nthe Rough Riders, in command of the Brigade; this change placed you in\r\ncommand of your regiment.\r\n\r\nThe Division moved from its camp on the evening of June 30th, and\r\nbivouacked at and about El Poso. I saw you personally in the vicinity\r\nof El Poso, about 8 A.M., July 1st. I saw you again on the road leading\r\nfrom El Poso to the San Juan River; you were at the head of your\r\nregiment, which was leading the Second Brigade, and immediately behind\r\nthe rear regiment of the First Brigade. My orders were to turn to the\r\nright at San Juan River and take up a line along that stream and try and\r\nconnect with General Lawton, who was to engage the enemy at El Caney. On\r\nreaching the river we came under the fire of the Spanish forces posted\r\non San Juan Ridge and Kettle Hill. The First Brigade was faced to the\r\nfront in line as soon as it had cleared the road, and the Second Brigade\r\nwas ordered to pass in rear of the first and face to the front when\r\nclear of the First Brigade. This movement was very difficult, owing to\r\nthe heavy undergrowth, and the regiments became more or less tangled up,\r\nbut eventually the formation was accomplished, and the Division stood\r\nin an irregular line along the San Juan River, the Second Brigade on\r\nthe right. We were subjected to a heavy fire from the forces on San\r\nJuan Ridge and Kettle Hill; our position was untenable, and it became\r\nnecessary to assault the enemy or fall back. Kettle Hill was immediately\r\nin front of the Cavalry, and it was determined to assault that hill. The\r\nFirst Brigade was ordered forward, and the Second Brigade was ordered\r\nto support the attack; personally, I accompanied a portion of the Tenth\r\nCavalry, Second Brigade, and the Rough Riders were to the right. This\r\nbrought your regiment to the right of the house which was at the summit\r\nof the hill. Shortly after I reached the crest of the hill you came\r\nto me, accompanied, I think, by Captain C. J. Stevens, of the Ninth\r\nCavalry. We were then in a position to see the line of intrenchments\r\nalong San Juan Ridge, and could see Kent's Infantry Division engaged on\r\nour left, and Hawkins' assault against Fort San Juan. You asked me for\r\npermission to move forward and assault San Juan Ridge. I gave you the\r\norder in person to move forward, and I saw you move forward and assault\r\nSan Juan Ridge with your regiment and portions of the First and Tenth\r\nCavalry belonging to your Brigade. I held a portion of the Second\r\nBrigade as a reserve on Kettle Hill, not knowing what force the enemy\r\nmight have in reserve behind the ridge. The First Brigade also moved\r\nforward and assaulted the ridge to the right of Fort San Juan. There\r\nwas a small lake between Kettle Hill and San Juan Ridge, and in moving\r\nforward your command passed to the right of this lake. This brought\r\nyou opposite a house on San Juan Ridge--not Fort San Juan proper, but a\r\nframe house surrounded by an earthwork. The enemy lost a number of men\r\nat this point, whose bodies lay in the trenches. Later in the day I rode\r\nalong the line, and, as I recall it, a portion of the Tenth Cavalry was\r\nimmediately about this house, and your regiment occupied an irregular\r\nsemi-circular position along the ridge and immediately to the right of\r\nthe house. You had pickets out to your front; and several hundred yards\r\nto your front the Spaniards had a heavy outpost occupying a house, with\r\nrifle pits surrounding it. Later in the day, and during the following\r\nday, the various regiments forming the Division were rearranged and\r\nbrought into tactical formation, the First Brigade on the left and\r\nimmediately to the right of Fort San Juan, and the Second Brigade on the\r\nright of the First.\r\n\r\nThis was the position occupied by the Cavalry Division until the final\r\nsurrender of the Spanish forces, on July 17, 1898.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion allow me to say, that I saw you, personally, at about 8\r\nA.M., at El Poso; later, on the road to San Juan River; later, on the\r\nsummit of Kettle Hill, immediately after its capture by the Cavalry\r\nDivision. I saw you move forward with your command to assault San Juan\r\nRidge, and I saw you on San Juan Ridge, where we visited your line\r\ntogether, and you explained to me the disposition of your command.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, with much respect, Your obedient servant, SAMUEL S. SUMNER,\r\nMajor-General United States Army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE NEW YORK GOVERNORSHIP\r\n\r\nIn September, 1898, the First Volunteer Cavalry, in company with most\r\nof the rest of the Fifth Army Corps, was disembarked at Montauk Point.\r\nShortly after it was disbanded, and a few days later, I was nominated\r\nfor Governor of New York by the Republican party. Timothy L. Woodruff\r\nwas nominated for Lieutenant-Governor. He was my stanch friend\r\nthroughout the term of our joint service.\r\n\r\nThe previous year, the machine or standpat Republicans, who were under\r\nthe domination of Senator Platt, had come to a complete break with the\r\nanti-machine element over the New York mayoralty. This had brought\r\nthe Republican party to a smash, not only in New York City, but in the\r\nState, where the Democratic candidate for Chief Judge of the Court\r\nof Appeals, Alton B. Parker, was elected by sixty or eighty thousand\r\nmajority. Mr. Parker was an able man, a lieutenant of Mr. Hill's,\r\nstanding close to the conservative Democrats of the Wall Street type.\r\nThese conservative Democrats were planning how to wrest the Democratic\r\nparty from the control of Mr. Bryan. They hailed Judge Parker's victory\r\nas a godsend. The Judge at once loomed up as a Presidential possibility,\r\nand was carefully groomed for the position by the New York Democratic\r\nmachine, and its financial allies in the New York business world.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans realized that the chances were very much against them.\r\nAccordingly the leaders were in a chastened mood and ready to nominate\r\nany candidate with whom they thought there was a chance of winning. I\r\nwas the only possibility, and, accordingly, under pressure from certain\r\nof the leaders who recognized this fact, and who responded to popular\r\npressure, Senator Platt picked me for the nomination. He was entirely\r\nfrank in the matter. He made no pretense that he liked me personally;\r\nbut he deferred to the judgment of those who insisted that I was the\r\nonly man who could be elected, and that therefore I had to be nominated.\r\n\r\nForemost among the leaders who pressed me on Mr. Platt (who \"pestered\"\r\nhim about me, to use his own words) were Mr. Quigg, Mr. Odell--then\r\nState Chairman of the Republican organization, and afterwards\r\nGovernor--and Mr. Hazel, now United States Judge. Judge Hazel did not\r\nknow me personally, but felt that the sentiment in his city, Buffalo,\r\ndemanded my nomination, and that the then Republican Governor, Mr.\r\nBlack, could not be reelected. Mr. Odell, who hardly knew me personally,\r\nfelt the same way about Mr. Black's chances, and, as he had just taken\r\nthe State Chairmanship, he was very anxious to win a victory. Mr. Quigg\r\nknew me quite well personally; he had been in touch with me for years,\r\nwhile he was a reporter on the _Tribune_, and also when he edited a\r\npaper in Montana; he had been on good terms with me while he was in\r\nCongress and I was Civil Service Commissioner, meeting me often in\r\ncompany with my especial cronies in Congress--men like Lodge, Speaker\r\nTom Reed, Greenhalge, Butterworth, and Dolliver--and he had urged my\r\nappointment as Police Commissioner on Mayor Strong.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Quigg who called on me at Montauk Point to sound me about the\r\nGovernorship; Mr. Platt being by no means enthusiastic over Mr. Quigg's\r\nmission, largely because he disapproved of the Spanish War and of my\r\npart in bringing it about. Mr. Quigg saw me in my tent, in which he\r\nspent a couple of hours with me, my brother-in-law, Douglas Robinson,\r\nbeing also present. Quigg spoke very frankly to me, stating that he\r\nearnestly desired to see me nominated and believed that the great body\r\nof Republican voters in the State so desired, but that the organization\r\nand the State Convention would finally do what Senator Platt desired. He\r\nsaid that county leaders were already coming to Senator Platt, hinting\r\nat a close election, expressing doubt of Governor Black's availability\r\nfor reelection, and asking why it would not be a good thing to nominate\r\nme; that now that I had returned to the United States this would go on\r\nmore and more all the time, and that he (Quigg) did not wish that\r\nthese men should be discouraged and be sent back to their localities to\r\nsuppress a rising sentiment in my favor. For this reason he said that\r\nhe wanted from me a plain statement as to whether or not I wanted the\r\nnomination, and as to what would be my attitude toward the organization\r\nin the event of my nomination and election, whether or not I would \"make\r\nwar\" on Mr. Platt and his friends, or whether I would confer with them\r\nand with the organization leaders generally, and give fair consideration\r\nto their point of view as to party policy and public interest. He said\r\nhe had not come to make me any offer of the nomination, and had no\r\nauthority to do so, nor to get any pledges or promises. He simply wanted\r\na frank definition of my attitude towards existing party conditions.\r\n\r\nTo this I replied that I should like to be nominated, and if nominated\r\nwould promise to throw myself into the campaign with all possible\r\nenergy. I said that I should not make war on Mr. Platt or anybody else\r\nif war could be avoided; that what I wanted was to be Governor and not a\r\nfaction leader; that I certainly would confer with the organization\r\nmen, as with everybody else who seemed to me to have knowledge of\r\nand interest in public affairs, and that as to Mr. Platt and the\r\norganization leaders, I would do so in the sincere hope that there might\r\nalways result harmony of opinion and purpose; but that while I would try\r\nto get on well with the organization, the organization must with equal\r\nsincerity strive to do what I regarded as essential for the public good;\r\nand that in every case, after full consideration of what everybody had\r\nto say who might possess real knowledge of the matter, I should have to\r\nact finally as my own judgment and conscience dictated and administer\r\nthe State government as I thought it ought to be administered. Quigg\r\nsaid that this was precisely what he supposed I would say, that it was\r\nall anybody could expect, and that he would state it to Senator Platt\r\nprecisely as I had put it to him, which he accordingly did; and,\r\nthroughout my term as Governor, Quigg lived loyally up to our\r\nunderstanding.[*]\r\n\r\n     [*] In a letter to me Mr. Quigg states, what I had\r\n     forgotten, that I told him to tell the Senator that I would\r\n     talk freely with him, and had no intention of becoming a\r\n     factional leader with a personal organization, yet that I\r\n     must have direct personal relations with everybody, and get\r\n     their views at first hand whenever I so desired, because I\r\n     could not have one man speaking for all.\r\n\r\nAfter being nominated, I made a hard and aggressive campaign through the\r\nState. My opponent was a respectable man, a judge, behind whom stood\r\nMr. Croker, the boss of Tammany Hall. My object was to make the people\r\nunderstand that it was Croker, and not the nominal candidate, who was my\r\nreal opponent; that the choice lay between Crokerism and myself. Croker\r\nwas a powerful and truculent man, the autocrat of his organization, and\r\nof a domineering nature. For his own reasons he insisted upon Tammany's\r\nturning down an excellent Democratic judge who was a candidate for\r\nreelection. This gave me my chance. Under my attack, Croker, who was a\r\nstalwart fighting man and who would not take an attack tamely, himself\r\ncame to the front. I was able to fix the contest in the public mind as\r\none between himself and myself; and, against all probabilities, I won by\r\nthe rather narrow margin of eighteen thousand plurality.\r\n\r\nAs I have already said, there is a lunatic fringe to every reform\r\nmovement. At least nine-tenths of all the sincere reformers supported\r\nme; but the ultra-pacifists, the so-called anti-imperialists, or\r\nanti-militarists, or peace-at-any-price men, preferred Croker to me;\r\nand another knot of extremists who had at first ardently insisted that\r\nI must be \"forced\" on Platt, as soon as Platt supported me themselves\r\nopposed me _because_ he supported me. After election John Hay wrote me\r\nas follows: \"While you are Governor, I believe the party can be\r\nmade solid as never before. You have already shown that a man may be\r\nabsolutely honest and yet practical; a reformer by instinct and a wise\r\npolitician; brave, bold, and uncompromising, and yet not a wild ass\r\nof the desert. The exhibition made by the professional independents in\r\nvoting against you for no reason on earth except that somebody else was\r\nvoting for you, is a lesson that is worth its cost.\"\r\n\r\nAt that time boss rule was at its very zenith. Mr. Bryan's candidacy in\r\n1896 on a free silver platform had threatened such frightful business\r\ndisaster as to make the business men, the wage-workers, and the\r\nprofessional classes generally, turn eagerly to the Republican party.\r\nEast of the Mississippi the Republican vote for Mr. McKinley was larger\r\nby far than it had been for Abraham Lincoln in the days when the life of\r\nthe Nation was at stake. Mr. Bryan championed many sorely needed reforms\r\nin the interest of the plain people; but many of his platform proposals,\r\neconomic and otherwise, were of such a character that to have put them\r\ninto practice would have meant to plunge all our people into conditions\r\nfar worse than any of those for which he sought a remedy. The free\r\nsilver advocates included sincere and upright men who were able to make\r\na strong case for their position; but with them and dominating them were\r\nall the believers in the complete or partial repudiation of National,\r\nState, and private debts; and not only the business men but the\r\nworkingmen grew to feel that under these circumstances too heavy a price\r\ncould not be paid to avert the Democratic triumph. The fear of Mr. Bryan\r\nthrew almost all the leading men of all classes into the arms of whoever\r\nopposed him.\r\n\r\nThe Republican bosses, who were already very powerful, and who were\r\nalready in fairly close alliance with the privileged interests, now\r\nfound everything working to their advantage. Good and high-minded men\r\nof conservative temperament in their panic played into the hands of the\r\nultra-reactionaries of business and politics. The alliance between the\r\ntwo kinds of privilege, political and financial, was closely cemented;\r\nand wherever there was any attempt to break it up, the cry was at once\r\nraised that this merely represented another phase of the assault on\r\nNational honesty and individual and mercantile integrity. As so often\r\nhappens, the excesses and threats of an unwise and extreme radicalism\r\nhad resulted in immensely strengthening the position of the\r\nbeneficiaries of reaction. This was the era when the Standard Oil\r\nCompany achieved a mastery of Pennsylvania politics so far-reaching\r\nand so corrupt that it is difficult to describe it without seeming to\r\nexaggerate.\r\n\r\nIn New York State, United States Senator Platt was the absolute boss of\r\nthe Republican party. \"Big business\" was back of him; yet at the time\r\nthis, the most important element in his strength, was only imperfectly\r\nunderstood. It was not until I was elected Governor that I myself came\r\nto understand it. We were still accustomed to talking of the \"machine\"\r\nas if it were something merely political, with which business had\r\nnothing to do. Senator Platt did not use his political position to\r\nadvance his private fortunes--therein differing absolutely from many\r\nother political bosses. He lived in hotels and had few extravagant\r\ntastes. Indeed, I could not find that he had any tastes at all except\r\nfor politics, and on rare occasions for a very dry theology wholly\r\ndivorced from moral implications. But big business men contributed\r\nto him large sums of money, which enabled him to keep his grip on\r\nthe machine and secured for them the help of the machine if they were\r\nthreatened with adverse legislation. The contributions were given in the\r\nguise of contributions for campaign purposes, of money for the good\r\nof the party; when the money was contributed there was rarely talk of\r\nspecific favors in return.[*] It was simply put into Mr. Platt's hands\r\nand treated by him as in the campaign chest. Then he distributed it\r\nin the districts where it was most needed by the candidates and\r\norganization leaders. Ordinarily no pledge was required from the latter\r\nto the bosses, any more than it was required by the business men\r\nfrom Mr. Platt or his lieutenants. No pledge was needed. It was all a\r\n\"gentlemen's understanding.\" As the Senator once said to me, if a man's\r\ncharacter was such that it was necessary to get a promise from him, it\r\nwas clear proof that his character was such that the promise would not\r\nbe worth anything after it was made.\r\n\r\n     [*] Each nation has its own pet sins to which it is merciful\r\n     and also sins which it treats as most abhorrent. In America\r\n     we are peculiarly sensitive about big money contributions\r\n     for which the donors expect any reward. In England, where in\r\n     some ways the standard is higher than here, such\r\n     contributions are accepted as a matter of course, nay, as\r\n     one of the methods by which wealthy men obtain peerages. It\r\n     would be well-nigh an impossibility for a man to secure a\r\n     seat in the United States Senate by mere campaign\r\n     contributions, in the way that seats in the British House of\r\n     Lords have often been secured without any scandal being\r\n     caused thereby.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that some of the worst practices of the machine\r\nin dealings of this kind represented merely virtues in the wrong place,\r\nvirtues wrenched out of proper relation to their surroundings. A man in\r\na doubtful district might win only because of the help Mr. Platt gave\r\nhim; he might be a decent young fellow without money enough to finance\r\nhis own campaign, who was able to finance it only because Platt of his\r\nown accord found out or was apprised of his need and advanced the money.\r\nSuch a man felt grateful, and, because of his good qualities, joined\r\nwith the purely sordid and corrupt heelers and crooked politicians to\r\nbecome part of the Platt machine. In his turn Mr. Platt was recognized\r\nby the business men, the big contributors, as an honorable man; not only\r\na man of his word, but a man who, whenever he received a favor, could be\r\ntrusted to do his best to repay it on any occasion that arose. I believe\r\nthat usually the contributors, and the recipient, sincerely felt that\r\nthe transaction was proper and subserved the cause of good politics\r\nand good business; and, indeed, as regards the major part of the\r\ncontributions, it is probable that this was the fact, and that the only\r\ncriticism that could properly be made about the contributions was that\r\nthey were not made with publicity--and at that time neither the parties\r\nnor the public had any realization that publicity was necessary, or any\r\nadequate understanding of the dangers of the \"invisible empire\"\r\nwhich throve by what was done in secrecy. Many, probably most, of the\r\ncontributors of this type never wished anything personal in exchange for\r\ntheir contributions, and made them with sincere patriotism, desiring in\r\nreturn only that the Government should be conducted on a proper basis.\r\nUnfortunately, it was, in practice, exceedingly difficult to distinguish\r\nthese men from the others who contributed big sums to the various party\r\nbosses with the expectation of gaining concrete and personal advantages\r\n(in which the bosses shared) at the expense of the general public. It\r\nwas very hard to draw the line between these two types of contributions.\r\n\r\nThere was but one kind of money contributions as to which it seemed to\r\nme absolutely impossible for either the contributor or the recipient to\r\ndisguise to themselves the evil meaning of the contribution. This was\r\nwhere a big corporation contributed to both political parties. I knew of\r\none such case where in a State campaign a big corporation which had many\r\ndealings with public officials frankly contributed in the neighborhood\r\nof a hundred thousand dollars to one campaign fund and fifty thousand\r\ndollars to the campaign fund of the other side--and, I believe, made\r\nsome further substantial contributions in the same ratio of two dollars\r\nto one side for every one dollar given to the other. The contributors\r\nwere Democrats, and the big contributions went to the Democratic\r\nmanagers. The Republican was elected, and after his election, when\r\na matter came up affecting the company, in which its interests were\r\nhostile to those of the general public, the successful candidate, then\r\nholding a high State office, was approached by his campaign managers\r\nand the situation put frankly before him. He was less disturbed than\r\nastonished, and remarked, \"Why, I thought So-and-so and his associates\r\nwere Democrats and subscribed to the Democratic campaign fund.\" \"So they\r\ndid,\" was the answer; \"they subscribed to them twice as much as they\r\nsubscribed to us, but if they had had any idea that you intended doing\r\nwhat you now say you will do, they would have subscribed it all to the\r\nother side, and more too.\" The State official in his turn answered that\r\nhe was very sorry if any one had subscribed under a misapprehension,\r\nthat it was no fault of his, for he had stated definitely and clearly\r\nhis position, that he of course had no money wherewith himself to return\r\nwhat without his knowledge had been contributed, and that all he could\r\nsay was that any man who had subscribed to his campaign fund under the\r\nimpression that the receipt of the subscription would be a bar to the\r\nperformance of public duty was sadly mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe control by Mr. Platt and his lieutenants over the organization was\r\nwell-nigh complete. There were splits among the bosses, and insurgent\r\nmovements now and then, but the ordinary citizens had no control over\r\nthe political machinery except in a very few districts. There were,\r\nhowever, plenty of good men in politics, men who either came from\r\ndistricts where there was popular control, or who represented a genuine\r\naspiration towards good citizenship on the part of some boss or group of\r\nbosses, or else who had been nominated frankly for reasons of expediency\r\nby bosses whose attitude towards good citizenship was at best one of\r\nGallio-like indifference. At the time when I was nominated for Governor,\r\nas later when Mr. Hughes was nominated and renominated for Governor,\r\nthere was no possibility of securing the nomination unless the bosses\r\npermitted it. In each case the bosses, the machine leaders, took a man\r\nfor whom they did not care, because he was the only man with whom they\r\ncould win. In the case of Mr. Hughes there was of course also the fact\r\nof pressure from the National Administration. But the bosses were never\r\novercome in a fair fight, when they had made up their minds to fight,\r\nuntil the Saratoga Convention in 1910, when Mr. Stimson was nominated\r\nfor Governor.\r\n\r\nSenator Platt had the same inborn capacity for the kind of politics\r\nwhich he liked that many big Wall Street men have shown for not wholly\r\ndissimilar types of finance. It was his chief interest, and he\r\napplied himself to it unremittingly. He handled his private business\r\nsuccessfully; but it was politics in which he was absorbed, and he\r\nconcerned himself therewith every day in the year. He had built up an\r\nexcellent system of organization, and the necessary funds came from\r\ncorporations and men of wealth who contributed as I have described\r\nabove. The majority of the men with a natural capacity for organization\r\nleadership of the type which has generally been prevalent in New York\r\npolitics turned to Senator Platt as their natural chief and helped build\r\nup the organization, until under his leadership it became more powerful\r\nand in a position of greater control than any other Republican machine\r\nin the country, excepting in Pennsylvania. The Democratic machines\r\nin some of the big cities, as in New York and Boston, and the country\r\nDemocratic machine of New York under David B. Hill, were probably\r\neven more efficient, representing an even more complete mastery by\r\nthe bosses, and an even greater degree of drilled obedience among the\r\nhenchmen. It would be an entire mistake to suppose that Mr. Platt's\r\nlieutenants were either all bad men or all influenced by unworthy\r\nmotives. He was constantly doing favors for men. He had won the\r\ngratitude of many good men. In the country districts especially, there\r\nwere many places where his machine included the majority of the best\r\ncitizens, the leading and substantial citizens, among the inhabitants.\r\nSome of his strongest and most efficient lieutenants were disinterested\r\nmen of high character.\r\n\r\nThere had always been a good deal of opposition to Mr. Platt and the\r\nmachine, but the leadership of this opposition was apt to be found only\r\namong those whom Abraham Lincoln called the \"silk stockings,\" and much\r\nof it excited almost as much derision among the plain people as the\r\nmachine itself excited anger or dislike. Very many of Mr. Platt's\r\nopponents really disliked him and his methods, for aesthetic rather than\r\nfor moral reasons, and the bulk of the people half-consciously felt this\r\nand refused to submit to their leadership. The men who opposed him in\r\nthis manner were good citizens according to their lights, prominent in\r\nthe social clubs and in philanthropic circles, men of means and often\r\nmen of business standing. They disliked coarse and vulgar politicians,\r\nand they sincerely reprobated all the shortcomings that were recognized\r\nby, and were offensive to, people of their own caste. They had not the\r\nslightest understanding of the needs, interests, ways of thought, and\r\nconvictions of the average small man; and the small man felt this,\r\nalthough he could not express it, and sensed that they were really not\r\nconcerned with his welfare, and that they did not offer him anything\r\nmaterially better from his point of view than the machine.\r\n\r\nWhen reformers of this type attempted to oppose Mr. Platt, they usually\r\nput up either some rather inefficient, well-meaning person, who\r\nbathed every day, and didn't steal, but whose only good point was\r\n\"respectability,\" and who knew nothing of the great fundamental\r\nquestions looming before us; or else they put up some big business man\r\nor corporation lawyer who was wedded to the gross wrong and injustice\r\nof our economic system, and who neither by personality nor by programme\r\ngave the ordinary plain people any belief that there was promise of\r\nvital good to them in the change. The correctness of their view was\r\nproved by the fact that as soon as fundamental economic and social\r\nreforms were at stake the aesthetic, as distinguished from the genuinely\r\nmoral, reformers, for the most part sided with the bosses against the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nWhen I became Governor, the conscience of the people was in no way or\r\nshape aroused, as it has since become roused. The people accepted and\r\npracticed in a matter-of-course way as quite proper things which they\r\nwould not now tolerate. They had no definite and clearly outlined\r\nconception of what they wished in the way of reform. They on the whole\r\ntolerated, and indeed approved of, the machine; and there had been no\r\ndevelopment on any considerable scale of reformers with the vision to\r\nsee what the needs of the people were, and the high purpose sanely to\r\nachieve what was necessary in order to meet these needs. I knew both the\r\nmachine and the silk-stocking reformers fairly well, from many years'\r\nclose association with them. The machine as such had no ideals at all,\r\nalthough many of the men composing it did have. On the other hand, the\r\nideals of very many of the silk-stocking reformers did not relate to\r\nthe questions of real and vital interest to our people; and, singularly\r\nenough, in international matters, these same silk-stockings were no more\r\nto be trusted than the average ignorant demagogue or shortsighted spoils\r\npoliticians. I felt that these men would be broken reeds to which to\r\ntrust in any vital contest for betterment of social and industrial\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nI had neither the training nor the capacity that would have enabled me\r\nto match Mr. Platt and his machine people on their own ground. Nor did\r\nI believe that the effort to build up a machine of my own under the then\r\nexisting conditions would meet the needs of the situation so far as the\r\npeople were concerned. I therefore made no effort to create a machine of\r\nmy own, and consistently adopted the plan of going over the heads of the\r\nmen holding public office and of the men in control of the organization,\r\nand appealing directly to the people behind them. The machine, for\r\ninstance, had a more or less strong control over the great bulk of the\r\nmembers of the State Legislature; but in the last resort the people\r\nbehind these legislators had a still greater control over them. I made\r\nup my mind that the only way I could beat the bosses whenever the need\r\nto do so arose (and unless there was such need I did not wish to try)\r\nwas, not by attempting to manipulate the machinery, and not by trusting\r\nmerely to the professional reformers, but by making my appeal as\r\ndirectly and as emphatically as I knew how to the mass of voters\r\nthemselves, to the people, to the men who if waked up would be able to\r\nimpose their will on their representatives. My success depended upon\r\ngetting the people in the different districts to look at matters in my\r\nway, and getting them to take such an active interest in affairs as to\r\nenable them to exercise control over their representatives.\r\n\r\nThere were a few of the Senators and Assemblymen whom I could reach by\r\nseeing them personally and putting before them my arguments; but most of\r\nthem were too much under the control of the machine for me to shake\r\nthem loose unless they knew that the people were actively behind me. In\r\nmaking my appeal to the people as a whole I was dealing with an entirely\r\ndifferent constituency from that which, especially in the big cities,\r\nliked to think of itself as the \"better element,\" the particular\r\nexponent of reform and good citizenship. I was dealing with shrewd,\r\nhard-headed, kindly men and women, chiefly concerned with the absorbing\r\nwork of earning their own living, and impatient of fads, who had grown\r\nto feel that the associations with the word \"reformer\" were not much\r\nbetter than the associations with the word \"politician.\" I had to\r\nconvince these men and women of my good faith, and, moreover, of my\r\ncommon sense and efficiency. They were most of them strong partisans,\r\nand an outrage had to be very real and very great to shake them even\r\npartially loose from their party affiliations. Moreover, they took\r\nlittle interest in any fight of mere personalities. They were not\r\ninfluenced in the least by the silk-stocking reform view of Mr. Platt.\r\nI knew that if they were persuaded that I was engaged in a mere faction\r\nfight against him, that it was a mere issue between his ambition and\r\nmine, they would at once become indifferent, and my fight would be lost.\r\n\r\nBut I felt that I could count on their support wherever I could show\r\nthem that the fight was not made just for the sake of the row, that it\r\nwas not made merely as a factional contest against Senator Platt and the\r\norganization, but was waged from a sense of duty for real and tangible\r\ncauses such as the promotion of governmental efficiency and honesty,\r\nand forcing powerful moneyed men to take the proper attitude toward the\r\ncommunity at large. They stood by me when I insisted upon having the\r\ncanal department, the insurance department, and the various departments\r\nof the State Government run with efficiency and honesty; they stood by\r\nme when I insisted upon making wealthy men who owned franchises pay\r\nthe State what they properly ought to pay; they stood by me when, in\r\nconnection with the strikes on the Croton Aqueduct and in Buffalo, I\r\npromptly used the military power of the State to put a stop to rioting\r\nand violence.\r\n\r\nIn the latter case my chief opponents and critics were local politicians\r\nwho were truckling to the labor vote; but in all cases coming under the\r\nfirst two categories I had serious trouble with the State leaders of the\r\nmachine. I always did my best, in good faith, to get Mr. Platt and the\r\nother heads of the machine to accept my views, and to convince them,\r\nby repeated private conversations, that I was right. I never wantonly\r\nantagonized or humiliated them. I did not wish to humiliate them or to\r\nseem victorious over them; what I wished was to secure the things that\r\nI thought it essential to the men and women of the State to secure. If I\r\ncould finally persuade them to support me, well and good; in such case I\r\ncontinued to work with them in the friendliest manner.\r\n\r\nIf after repeated and persistent effort I failed to get them to support\r\nme, then I made a fair fight in the open, and in a majority of cases I\r\ncarried my point and succeeded in getting through the legislation which\r\nI wished. In theory the Executive has nothing to do with legislation. In\r\npractice, as things now are, the Executive is or ought to be peculiarly\r\nrepresentative of the people as a whole. As often as not the action\r\nof the Executive offers the only means by which the people can get the\r\nlegislation they demand and ought to have. Therefore a good executive\r\nunder the present conditions of American political life must take a very\r\nactive interest in getting the right kind of legislation, in addition\r\nto performing his executive duties with an eye single to the public\r\nwelfare. More than half of my work as Governor was in the direction of\r\ngetting needed and important legislation. I accomplished this only by\r\narousing the people, and riveting their attention on what was done.\r\n\r\nGradually the people began to wake up more and more to the fact that the\r\nmachine politicians were not giving them the kind of government which\r\nthey wished. As this waking up grew more general, not merely in New York\r\nor any other one State, but throughout most of the Nation, the power\r\nof the bosses waned. Then a curious thing happened. The professional\r\nreformers who had most loudly criticized these bosses began to change\r\ntoward them. Newspaper editors, college presidents, corporation lawyers,\r\nand big business men, all alike, had denounced the bosses and had taken\r\npart in reform movements against them so long as these reforms dealt\r\nonly with things that were superficial, or with fundamental things that\r\ndid not affect themselves and their associates. But the majority\r\nof these men turned to the support of the bosses when the great new\r\nmovement began clearly to make itself evident as one against privilege\r\nin business no less than against privilege in politics, as one for\r\nsocial and industrial no less than for political righteousness and fair\r\ndealing. The big corporation lawyer who had antagonized the boss in\r\nmatters which he regarded as purely political stood shoulder to shoulder\r\nwith the boss when the movement for betterment took shape in direct\r\nattack on the combination of business with politics and with the\r\njudiciary which has done so much to enthrone privilege in the economic\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe reformers who denounced political corruption and fraud when shown\r\nat the expense of their own candidates by machine ward heelers of a low\r\ntype hysterically applauded similar corrupt trickery when practiced by\r\nthese same politicians against men with whose political and industrial\r\nprogramme the reformers were not in sympathy. I had always been\r\ninstinctively and by nature a democrat, but if I had needed conversion\r\nto the democratic ideal here in America the stimulus would have been\r\nsupplied by what I saw of the attitude, not merely of the bulk of the\r\nmen of greatest wealth, but of the bulk of the men who most prided\r\nthemselves upon their education and culture, when we began in good faith\r\nto grapple with the wrong and injustice of our social and industrial\r\nsystem, and to hit at the men responsible for the wrong, no matter how\r\nhigh they stood in business or in politics, at the bar or on the bench.\r\nIt was while I was Governor, and especially in connection with the\r\nfranchise tax legislation, that I first became thoroughly aware of the\r\nreal causes of this attitude among the men of great wealth and among the\r\nmen who took their tone from the men of great wealth.\r\n\r\nVery soon after my victory in the race for Governor I had one or two\r\nexperiences with Senator Platt which showed in amusing fashion how\r\nabsolute the rule of the boss was in the politics of that day. Senator\r\nPlatt, who was always most kind and friendly in his personal relations\r\nwith me, asked me in one day to talk over what was to be done at Albany.\r\nHe had the two or three nominal heads of the organization with him. They\r\nwere his lieutenants, who counseled and influenced him, whose advice he\r\noften followed, but who, when he had finally made up his mind, merely\r\nregistered and carried out his decrees. After a little conversation the\r\nSenator asked if I had any member of the Assembly whom I wished to\r\nhave put on any committee, explaining that the committees were being\r\narranged. I answered no, and expressed my surprise at what he had said,\r\nbecause I had not understood the Speaker who appointed the committees\r\nhad himself been agreed upon by the members-elect. \"Oh!\" responded the\r\nSenator, with a tolerant smile, \"He has not been chosen yet, but of\r\ncourse whoever we choose as Speaker will agree beforehand to make the\r\nappointments we wish.\" I made a mental note to the effect that if they\r\nattempted the same process with the Governor-elect they would find\r\nthemselves mistaken.\r\n\r\nIn a few days the opportunity to prove this arrived. Under the preceding\r\nAdministration there had been grave scandals about the Erie Canal, the\r\ntrans-State Canal, and these scandals had been one of the chief issues\r\nin the campaign for the Governorship. The construction of this work was\r\nunder the control of the Superintendent of Public Works. In the actual\r\nstate of affairs his office was by far the most important office under\r\nme, and I intended to appoint to it some man of high character and\r\ncapacity who could be trusted to do the work not merely honestly and\r\nefficiently, but without regard to politics. A week or so after the\r\nSpeakership incident Senator Platt asked me to come and see him (he was\r\nan old and physically feeble man, able to move about only with extreme\r\ndifficulty).\r\n\r\nOn arrival I found the Lieutenant-Governor elect, Mr. Woodruff, who had\r\nalso been asked to come. The Senator informed me that he was glad to\r\nsay that I would have a most admirable man as Superintendent of Public\r\nWorks, as he had just received a telegram from a certain gentleman, whom\r\nhe named, saying that he would accept the position! He handed me the\r\ntelegram. The man in question was a man I liked; later I appointed him\r\nto an important office in which he did well. But he came from a city\r\nalong the line of the canal, so that I did not think it best that he\r\nshould be appointed anyhow; and, moreover, what was far more important,\r\nit was necessary to have it understood at the very outset that the\r\nAdministration was my Administration and was no one else's but mine. So\r\nI told the Senator very politely that I was sorry, but that I could not\r\nappoint his man. This produced an explosion, but I declined to lose my\r\ntemper, merely repeating that I must decline to accept any man chosen\r\nfor me, and that I must choose the man myself. Although I was very\r\npolite, I was also very firm, and Mr. Platt and his friends finally\r\nabandoned their position.\r\n\r\nI appointed an engineer from Brooklyn, a veteran of the Civil War,\r\nColonel Partridge, who had served in Mayor Low's administration. He was\r\nan excellent man in every way. He chose as his assistant, actively to\r\nsuperintend the work, a Cornell graduate named Elon Hooker, a man with\r\nno political backing at all, picked simply because he was the best\r\nequipped man for the place. The office, the most important office under\r\nme, was run in admirable fashion throughout my Administration; I\r\ndoubt if there ever was an important department of the New York State\r\nGovernment run with a higher standard of efficiency and integrity.\r\n\r\nBut this was not all that had to be done about the canals. Evidently\r\nthe whole policy hitherto pursued had been foolish and inadequate. I\r\nappointed a first-class non-partisan commission of business men and\r\nexpert engineers who went into the matter exhaustively, and their report\r\nserved as the basis upon which our entire present canal system is based.\r\nThere remained the question of determining whether the canal officials\r\nwho were in office before I became Governor, and whom I had declined to\r\nreappoint, had been guilty of any action because of which it would be\r\npossible to proceed against them criminally or otherwise under the law.\r\nSuch criminal action had been freely charged against them during the\r\ncampaign by the Democratic (including the so-called mugwump) press. To\r\ndetermine this matter I appointed two Democratic lawyers, Messrs. Fox\r\nand MacFarlane (the latter Federal District Attorney for New York under\r\nPresident Cleveland), and put the whole investigation in their hands.\r\nThese gentlemen made an exhaustive investigation lasting several months.\r\nThey reported that there had been grave delinquency in the prosecution\r\nof the work, delinquency which justified public condemnation of those\r\nresponsible for it (who were out of office), but that there was\r\nno ground for criminal prosecution. I laid their report before the\r\nLegislature with a message in which I said: \"There is probably no lawyer\r\nof high standing in the State who, after studying the report of counsel\r\nin this case and the testimony taken by the investigating commission,\r\nwould disagree with them as to the impracticability of a successful\r\nprosecution. Under such circumstances the one remedy was a thorough\r\nchange in the methods and management. This change has been made.\"\r\n\r\nWhen my successor in the Governorship took office, Colonel Partridge\r\nretired, and Elon Hooker, finding that he could no longer act with\r\nentire disregard of politics and with an eye single to the efficiency of\r\nthe work, also left. A dozen years later--having in the meantime made\r\na marked success in a business career--he became the Treasurer of the\r\nNational Progressive party.\r\n\r\nMy action in regard to the canals, and the management of his office,\r\nthe most important office under me, by Colonel Partridge, established\r\nmy relations with Mr. Platt from the outset on pretty nearly the right\r\nbasis. But, besides various small difficulties, we had one or two\r\nserious bits of trouble before my duties as Governor ceased. It must be\r\nremembered that Mr. Platt was to all intents and purposes a large part\r\nof, and sometimes a majority of, the Legislature. There were a few\r\nentirely independent men such as Nathaniel Elsberg, Regis Post, and\r\nAlford Cooley, in each of the two houses; the remainder were under the\r\ncontrol of the Republican and Democratic bosses, but could also be more\r\nor less influenced by an aroused public opinion. The two machines were\r\napt to make common cause if their vital interests were touched. It was\r\nmy business to devise methods by which either the two machines could be\r\nkept apart or else overthrown if they came together.\r\n\r\nMy desire was to achieve results, and not merely to issue manifestoes\r\nof virtue. It is very easy to be efficient if the efficiency is based\r\non unscrupulousness, and it is still easier to be virtuous if one is\r\ncontent with the purely negative virtue which consists in not doing\r\nanything wrong, but being wholly unable to accomplish anything positive\r\nfor good. My favorite quotation from Josh Billings again applies: It is\r\nso much easier to be a harmless dove than a wise serpent. My duty was to\r\ncombine both idealism and efficiency. At that time the public conscience\r\nwas still dormant as regards many species of political and business\r\nmisconduct, as to which during the next decade it became sensitive. I\r\nhad to work with the tools at hand and to take into account the feeling\r\nof the people, which I have already described. My aim was persistently\r\nto refuse to be put in a position where what I did would seem to be a\r\nmere faction struggle against Senator Platt. My aim was to make a fight\r\nonly when I could so manage it that there could be no question in the\r\nminds of honest men that my prime purpose was not to attack Mr. Platt\r\nor any one else except as a necessary incident to securing clean and\r\nefficient government.\r\n\r\nIn each case I did my best to persuade Mr. Platt not to oppose me. I\r\nendeavored to make it clear to him that I was not trying to wrest the\r\norganization from him; and I always gave him in detail the reasons why I\r\nfelt I had to take the position I intended to adopt. It was only after I\r\nhad exhausted all the resources of my patience that I would finally, if\r\nhe still proved obstinate, tell him that I intended to make the fight\r\nanyhow. As I have said, the Senator was an old and feeble man in\r\nphysique, and it was possible for him to go about very little. Until\r\nFriday evening he would be kept at his duties at Washington, while I was\r\nin Albany. If I wished to see him it generally had to be at his hotel\r\nin New York on Saturday, and usually I would go there to breakfast with\r\nhim. The one thing I would not permit was anything in the nature of a\r\nsecret or clandestine meeting. I always insisted on going openly. Solemn\r\nreformers of the tom-fool variety, who, according to their custom, paid\r\nattention to the name and not the thing, were much exercised over my\r\n\"breakfasting with Platt.\" Whenever I breakfasted with him they became\r\nsure that the fact carried with it some sinister significance. The\r\nworthy creatures never took the trouble to follow the sequence of facts\r\nand events for themselves. If they had done so they would have seen that\r\nany series of breakfasts with Platt always meant that I was going to\r\ndo something he did not like, and that I was trying, courteously and\r\nfrankly, to reconcile him to it. My object was to make it as easy as\r\npossible for him to come with me. As long as there was no clash between\r\nus there was no object in my seeing him; it was only when the clash came\r\nor was imminent that I had to see him. A series of breakfasts was always\r\nthe prelude to some active warfare.[*] In every instance I substantially\r\ncarried my point, although in some cases not in exactly the way in which\r\nI had originally hoped.\r\n\r\n     [*] To illustrate my meaning I quote from a letter of mine\r\n     to Senator Platt of December 13, 1899. He had been trying to\r\n     get me to promote a certain Judge X over the head of another\r\n     Judge Y. I wrote: \"There is a strong feeling among the\r\n     judges and the leading members of the bar that Judge Y ought\r\n     not to have Judge X jumped over his head, and I do not see\r\n     my way clear to doing it. I am inclined to think that the\r\n     solution I mentioned to you is the solution I shall have to\r\n     adopt. Remember the breakfast at Douglas Robinson's at\r\n     8:30.\"\r\n\r\nThere were various measures to which he gave a grudging and querulous\r\nassent without any break being threatened. I secured the reenactment\r\nof the Civil Service Law, which under my predecessor had very foolishly\r\nbeen repealed. I secured a mass of labor legislation, including the\r\nenactment of laws to increase the number of factory inspectors, to\r\ncreate a Tenement House Commission (whose findings resulted in further\r\nand excellent legislation to improve housing conditions), to regulate\r\nand improve sweatshop labor, to make the eight-hour and prevailing rate\r\nof wages law effective, to secure the genuine enforcement of the act\r\nrelating to the hours of railway workers, to compel railways to equip\r\nfreight trains with air-brakes, to regulate the working hours of women\r\nand protect both women and children from dangerous machinery, to enforce\r\ngood scaffolding provisions for workmen on buildings, to provide seats\r\nfor the use of waitresses in hotels and restaurants, to reduce the\r\nhours of labor for drug-store clerks, to provide for the registration of\r\nlaborers for municipal employment. I tried hard but failed to secure an\r\nemployers' liability law and the state control of employment offices.\r\nThere was hard fighting over some of these bills, and, what was much\r\nmore serious, there was effort to get round the law by trickery and by\r\nsecuring its inefficient enforcement. I was continually helped by men\r\nwith whom I had gotten in touch while in the Police Department; men such\r\nas James Bronson Reynolds, through whom I first became interested in\r\nsettlement work on the East Side. Once or twice I went suddenly down to\r\nNew York City without warning any one and traversed the tenement-house\r\nquarters, visiting various sweat-shops picked at random. Jake Riis\r\naccompanied me; and as a result of our inspection we got not only\r\nan improvement in the law but a still more marked improvement in its\r\nadministration. Thanks chiefly to the activity and good sense of Dr.\r\nJohn H. Pryor, of Buffalo, and by the use of every pound of pressure\r\nwhich as Governor I could bring to bear in legitimate fashion--including\r\na special emergency message--we succeeded in getting through a bill\r\nproviding for the first State hospital for incipient tuberculosis. We\r\ngot valuable laws for the farmer; laws preventing the adulteration of\r\nfood products (which laws were equally valuable to the consumer), and\r\nlaws helping the dairyman. In addition to labor legislation I was able\r\nto do a good deal for forest preservation and the protection of our\r\nwild life. All that later I strove for in the Nation in connection with\r\nConservation was foreshadowed by what I strove to obtain for New York\r\nState when I was Governor; and I was already working in connection with\r\nGifford Pinchot and Newell. I secured better administration, and some\r\nimprovement in the laws themselves. The improvement in administration,\r\nand in the character of the game and forest wardens, was secured partly\r\nas the result of a conference in the executive chamber which I held with\r\nforty of the best guides and woodsmen of the Adirondacks.\r\n\r\nAs regards most legislation, even that affecting labor and the forests,\r\nI got on fairly well with the machine. But on the two issues in which\r\n\"big business\" and the kind of politics which is allied to big business\r\nwere most involved we clashed hard--and clashing with Senator Platt\r\nmeant clashing with the entire Republican organization, and with the\r\norganized majority in each house of the Legislature. One clash was in\r\nconnection with the Superintendent of Insurance, a man whose office made\r\nhim a factor of immense importance in the big business circles of New\r\nYork. The then incumbent of the office was an efficient man, the boss\r\nof an up-State county, a veteran politician and one of Mr. Platt's\r\nright-hand men. Certain investigations which I made--in the course of\r\nthe fight--showed that this Superintendent of Insurance had been engaged\r\nin large business operations in New York City. These operations had\r\nthrown him into a peculiarly intimate business contact of one sort and\r\nanother with various financiers with whom I did not deem it expedient\r\nthat the Superintendent of Insurance, while such, should have any\r\nintimate and secret money-making relations. Moreover, the gentleman\r\nin question represented the straitest sect of the old-time spoils\r\npoliticians. I therefore determined not to reappoint him. Unless I could\r\nget his successor confirmed, however, he would stay in under the law,\r\nand the Republican machine, with the assistance of Tammany, expected to\r\ncontrol far more than a majority of all the Senators.\r\n\r\nMr. Platt issued an ultimatum to me that the incumbent must be\r\nreappointed or else that he would fight, and that if he chose to fight\r\nthe man would stay in anyhow because I could not oust him--for under the\r\nNew York Constitution the assent of the Senate was necessary not only\r\nto appoint a man to office but to remove him from office. As always with\r\nMr. Platt, I persistently refused to lose my temper, no matter what\r\nhe said--he was much too old and physically feeble for there to be any\r\npoint of honor in taking up any of his remarks--and I merely explained\r\ngood-humoredly that I had made up my mind and that the gentleman\r\nin question would not be retained. As for not being able to get his\r\nsuccessor confirmed, I pointed out that as soon as the Legislature\r\nadjourned I could and would appoint another man temporarily. Mr.\r\nPlatt then said that the incumbent would be put back as soon as the\r\nLegislature reconvened; I admitted that this was possible, but\r\nadded cheerfully that I would remove him again just as soon as that\r\nLegislature adjourned, and that even though I had an uncomfortable time\r\nmyself, I would guarantee to make my opponents more uncomfortable still.\r\nWe parted without any sign of reaching an agreement.\r\n\r\nThere remained some weeks before final action could be taken, and the\r\nSenator was confident that I would have to yield. His most efficient\r\nallies were the pretended reformers, most of them my open or covert\r\nenemies, who loudly insisted that I must make an open fight on the\r\nSenator himself and on the Republican organization. This was what he\r\nwished, for at that time there was no way of upsetting him within the\r\nRepublican party; and, as I have said, if I had permitted the contest\r\nto assume the shape of a mere faction fight between the Governor and the\r\nUnited States Senator, I would have insured the victory of the\r\nmachine. So I blandly refused to let the thing become a personal fight,\r\nexplaining again and again that I was perfectly willing to appoint an\r\norganization man, and naming two or three whom I was willing to appoint,\r\nbut also explaining that I would not retain the incumbent, and would not\r\nappoint any man of his type. Meanwhile pressure on behalf of the said\r\nincumbent began to come from the business men of New York.\r\n\r\nThe Superintendent of Insurance was not a man whose ill will the big\r\nlife insurance companies cared to incur, and company after company\r\npassed resolutions asking me to reappoint him, although in private some\r\nof the men who signed these resolutions nervously explained that they\r\ndid not mean what they had written, and hoped I would remove the man. A\r\ncitizen prominent in reform circles, marked by the Cato-like austerity\r\nof his reform professions, had a son who was a counsel for one of the\r\ninsurance companies. The father was engaged in writing letters to the\r\npapers demanding in the name of uncompromising virtue that I should not\r\nonly get rid of the Superintendent of Insurance, but in his place should\r\nappoint somebody or other personally offensive to Senator Platt--which\r\nlast proposition, if adopted, would have meant that the Superintendent\r\nof Insurance would have stayed in, for the reasons I have already given.\r\nMeanwhile the son came to see me on behalf of the insurance company he\r\nrepresented and told me that the company was anxious that there should\r\nbe a change in the superintendency; that if I really meant to fight,\r\nthey thought they had influence with four of the State Senators,\r\nDemocrats and Republicans, whom they could get to vote to confirm\r\nthe man I nominated, but that they wished to be sure that I would not\r\nabandon the fight, because it would be a very bad thing for them if I\r\nstarted the fight and then backed down. I told my visitor that he need\r\nbe under no apprehensions, that I would certainly see the fight through.\r\nA man who has much to do with that kind of politics which concerns both\r\nNew York politicians and New York business men and lawyers is not easily\r\nsurprised, and therefore I felt no other emotion than a rather sardonic\r\namusement when thirty-six hours later I read in the morning paper\r\nan open letter from the officials of the very company who had been\r\ncommunicating with me in which they enthusiastically advocated the\r\nrenomination of the Superintendent. Shortly afterwards my visitor,\r\nthe young lawyer, called me up on the telephone and explained that the\r\nofficials did not mean what they had said in this letter, that they had\r\nbeen obliged to write it for fear of the Superintendent, but that if\r\nthey got the chance they intended to help me get rid of him. I thanked\r\nhim and said I thought I could manage the fight by myself. I did not\r\nhear from him again, though his father continued to write public demands\r\nthat I should practice pure virtue, undefiled and offensive.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Senator Platt declined to yield. I had picked out a man,\r\na friend of his, who I believed would make an honest and competent\r\nofficial, and whose position in the organization was such that I did not\r\nbelieve the Senate would venture to reject him. However, up to the\r\nday before the appointment was to go to the Senate, Mr. Platt remained\r\nunyielding. I saw him that afternoon and tried to get him to yield, but\r\nhe said No, that if I insisted, it would be war to the knife, and my\r\ndestruction, and perhaps the destruction of the party. I said I was\r\nvery sorry, that I could not yield, and if the war came it would have\r\nto come, and that next morning I should send in the name of the\r\nSuperintendent's successor. We parted, and soon afterwards I received\r\nfrom the man who was at the moment Mr. Platt's right-hand lieutenant\r\na request to know where he could see me that evening. I appointed the\r\nUnion League Club. My visitor went over the old ground, explained that\r\nthe Senator would under no circumstances yield, that he was certain to\r\nwin in the fight, that my reputation would be destroyed, and that he\r\nwished to save me from such a lamentable smash-up as an ending to my\r\ncareer. I could only repeat what I had already said, and after half an\r\nhour of futile argument I rose and said that nothing was to be gained by\r\nfurther talk and that I might as well go. My visitor repeated that I\r\nhad this last chance, and that ruin was ahead of me if I refused it;\r\nwhereas, if I accepted, everything would be made easy. I shook my head\r\nand answered, \"There is nothing to add to what I have already said.\" He\r\nresponded, \"You have made up your mind?\" and I said, \"I have.\" He then\r\nsaid, \"You know it means your ruin?\" and I answered, \"Well, we will see\r\nabout that,\" and walked toward the door. He said, \"You understand, the\r\nfight will begin to-morrow and will be carried on to the bitter end.\"\r\nI said, \"Yes,\" and added, as I reached the door, \"Good night.\" Then, as\r\nthe door opened, my opponent, or visitor, whichever one chooses to call\r\nhim, whose face was as impassive and as inscrutable as that of Mr. John\r\nHamlin in a poker game, said: \"Hold on! We accept. Send in So-and-so\r\n[the man I had named]. The Senator is very sorry, but he will make no\r\nfurther opposition!\" I never saw a bluff carried more resolutely\r\nthrough to the final limit. My success in the affair, coupled with the\r\nappointment of Messrs. Partridge and Hooker, secured me against further\r\neffort to interfere with my handling of the executive departments.\r\n\r\nIt was in connection with the insurance business that I first met Mr.\r\nGeorge W. Perkins. He came to me with a letter of introduction from the\r\nthen Speaker of the National House of Representatives, Tom Reed,\r\nwhich ran: \"Mr. Perkins is a personal friend of mine, whose\r\nstraightforwardness and intelligence will commend to you whatever he has\r\nto say. If you will give him proper opportunity to explain his business,\r\nI have no doubt that what he will say will be worthy of your attention.\"\r\nMr. Perkins wished to see me with reference to a bill that had just been\r\nintroduced in the Legislature, which aimed to limit the aggregate volume\r\nof insurance that any New York State company could assume. There\r\nwere then three big insurance companies in New York--the Mutual Life,\r\nEquitable, and New York Life. Mr. Perkins was a Vice-President of\r\nthe New York Life Insurance Company and Mr. John A. McCall was its\r\nPresident. I had just finished my fight against the Superintendent of\r\nInsurance, whom I refused to continue in office. Mr. McCall had written\r\nme a very strong letter urging that he be retained, and had done\r\neverything he could to aid Senator Platt in securing his retention. The\r\nMutual Life and Equitable people had openly followed the same course,\r\nbut in private had hedged. They were both backing the proposed bill. Mr.\r\nMcCall was opposed to it; he was in California, and just before starting\r\nthither he had been told by the Mutual Life and Equitable that the\r\nLimitation Bill was favored by me and would be put through if such a\r\nthing were possible. Mr. McCall did not know me, and on leaving for\r\nCalifornia told Mr. Perkins that from all he could learn he was sure I\r\nwas bent on putting this bill through, and that nothing he could say\r\nto me would change my view; in fact, because he had fought so hard\r\nto retain the old Insurance Superintendent, he felt that I would be\r\nparticularly opposed to anything he might wish done.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, I had no such feeling. I had been carefully\r\nstudying the question. I had talked with the Mutual Life and Equitable\r\npeople about it, but was not committed to any particular course, and had\r\ngrave doubts as to whether it was well to draw the line on size instead\r\nof on conduct. I was therefore very glad to see Perkins and get a new\r\npoint of view. I went over the matter with a great deal of care and at\r\nconsiderable length, and after we had thrashed the matter out pretty\r\nfully and Perkins had laid before me in detail the methods employed by\r\nAustria, Germany, Switzerland, and other European countries to handle\r\ntheir large insurance companies, I took the position that there\r\nundoubtedly were evils in the insurance business, but that they did not\r\nconsist in insuring people's lives, for that certainly was not an evil;\r\nand I did not see how the real evils could be eradicated by limiting or\r\nsuppressing a company's ability to protect an additional number of lives\r\nwith insurance. I therefore announced that I would not favor a bill that\r\nlimited volume of business, and would not sign it if it were passed;\r\nbut that I favored legislation that would make it impossible to place,\r\nthrough agents, policies that were ambiguous and misleading, or to pay\r\nexorbitant prices to agents for business, or to invest policy-holders'\r\nmoney in improper securities, or to give power to officers to use\r\nthe company's funds for their own personal profit. In reaching this\r\ndetermination I was helped by Mr. Loeb, then merely a stenographer in\r\nmy office, but who had already attracted my attention both by his\r\nefficiency and by his loyalty to his former employers, who were for\r\nthe most part my political opponents. Mr. Loeb gave me much information\r\nabout various improper practices in the insurance business. I began\r\nto gather data on the subject, with the intention of bringing about\r\ncorrective legislation, for at that time I expected to continue\r\nin office as Governor. But in a few weeks I was nominated as\r\nVice-President, and my successor did nothing about the matter.\r\n\r\nSo far as I remember, this was the first time the question of correcting\r\nevils in a business by limiting the volume of business to be done was\r\never presented to me, and my decision in the matter was on all fours\r\nwith the position I have always since taken when any similar principle\r\nwas involved. At the time when I made my decision about the Limitation\r\nBill, I was on friendly terms with the Mutual and Equitable people\r\nwho were back of it, whereas I did not know Mr. McCall at all, and Mr.\r\nPerkins only from hearing him discuss the bill.\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature of the matter developed subsequently. Five years\r\nlater, after the insurance investigations took place, the Mutual Life\r\nstrongly urged the passage of a Limitation Bill, and, because of the\r\npopular feeling developed by the exposure of the improper practices of\r\nthe companies, this bill was generally approved. Governor Hughes adopted\r\nthe suggestion, such a bill was passed by the Legislature, and Governor\r\nHughes signed it. This bill caused the three great New York companies to\r\nreduce markedly the volume of business they were doing; it threw a great\r\nmany agents out of employment, and materially curtailed the foreign\r\nbusiness of the companies--which business was bringing annually a\r\nconsiderable sum of money to this country for investment. In short,\r\nthe experiment worked so badly that before Governor Hughes went out of\r\noffice one of the very last bills he signed was one that permitted the\r\nlife insurance companies to increase their business each year by an\r\namount representing a certain percentage of the business they had\r\npreviously done. This in practice, within a few years, practically\r\nannulled the Limitation Bill that had been previously passed. The\r\nexperiment of limiting the size of business, of legislating against it\r\nmerely because it was big, had been tried, and had failed so completely\r\nthat the authors of the bill had themselves in effect repealed it. My\r\naction in refusing to try the experiment had been completely justified.\r\n\r\nAs a sequel to this incident I got Mr. Perkins to serve on the Palisade\r\nPark Commission. At the time I was taking active part in the effort to\r\nsave the Palisades from vandalism and destruction by getting the States\r\nof New York and New Jersey jointly to include them in a public park.\r\nIt is not easy to get a responsible and capable man of business to\r\nundertake such a task, which is unpaid, which calls on his part for an\r\nimmense expenditure of time, money, and energy, which offers no\r\nreward of any kind, and which entails the certainty of abuse and\r\nmisrepresentation. Mr. Perkins accepted the position, and has filled\r\nit for the last thirteen years, doing as disinterested, efficient,\r\nand useful a bit of public service as any man in the State has done\r\nthroughout these thirteen years.\r\n\r\nThe case of most importance in which I clashed with Senator Platt\r\nrelated to a matter of fundamental governmental policy, and was the\r\nfirst step I ever took toward bringing big corporations under effective\r\ngovernmental control. In this case I had to fight the Democratic machine\r\nas well as the Republican machine, for Senator Hill and Senator Platt\r\nwere equally opposed to my action, and the big corporation men, the big\r\nbusiness men back of both of them, took precisely the same view of these\r\nmatters without regard to their party feelings on other points. What\r\nI did convulsed people at that time, and marked the beginning of the\r\neffort, at least in the Eastern states, to make the great corporations\r\nreally responsible to popular wish and governmental command. But we\r\nhave gone so far past the stage in which we then were that now it seems\r\nwell-nigh incredible that there should have been any opposition at all\r\nto what I at that time proposed.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of electric power for horse power in the street car\r\nlines of New York offered a fruitful chance for the most noxious type of\r\ndealing between business men and politicians. The franchises granted by\r\nNew York were granted without any attempt to secure from the grantees\r\nreturns, in the way of taxation or otherwise, for the value received.\r\nThe fact that they were thus granted by improper favoritism, a\r\nfavoritism which in many cases was unquestionably secured by downright\r\nbribery, led to all kinds of trouble. In return for the continuance\r\nof these improper favors to the corporations the politicians expected\r\nimproper favors in the way of excessive campaign contributions, often\r\ncontributed by the same corporation at the same time to two opposing\r\nparties. Before I became Governor a bill had been introduced into the\r\nNew York Legislature to tax the franchises of these street railways. It\r\naffected a large number of corporations, but particularly those in New\r\nYork and Buffalo. It had been suffered to slumber undisturbed, as none\r\nof the people in power dreamed of taking it seriously, and both the\r\nRepublican and Democratic machines were hostile to it. Under the rules\r\nof the New York Legislature a bill could always be taken up out of its\r\nturn and passed if the Governor sent in a special emergency message on\r\nits behalf.\r\n\r\nAfter I was elected Governor I had my attention directed to the\r\nfranchise tax matter, looked into the subject, and came to the\r\nconclusion that it was a matter of plain decency and honesty that these\r\ncompanies should pay a tax on their franchises, inasmuch as they did\r\nnothing that could be considered as service rendered the public in lieu\r\nof a tax. This seemed to me so evidently the common-sense and decent\r\nthing to do that I was hardly prepared for the storm of protest and\r\nanger which my proposal aroused. Senator Platt and the other machine\r\nleaders did everything to get me to abandon my intention. As usual,\r\nI saw them, talked the matter all over with them, and did my best to\r\nconvert them to my way of thinking. Senator Platt, I believe, was quite\r\nsincere in his opposition. He did not believe in popular rule, and he\r\ndid believe that the big business men were entitled to have things their\r\nway. He profoundly distrusted the people--naturally enough, for the kind\r\nof human nature with which a boss comes in contact is not of an exalted\r\ntype. He felt that anarchy would come if there was any interference\r\nwith a system by which the people in mass were, under various necessary\r\ncloaks, controlled by the leaders in the political and business worlds.\r\nHe wrote me a very strong letter of protest against my attitude,\r\nexpressed in dignified, friendly, and temperate language, but using one\r\nword in a curious way. This was the word \"altruistic.\" He stated in his\r\nletter that he had not objected to my being independent in politics,\r\nbecause he had been sure that I had the good of the party at heart, and\r\nmeant to act fairly and honorably; but that he had been warned, before\r\nI became a candidate, by a number of his business friends that I was a\r\ndangerous man because I was \"altruistic,\" and that he now feared that\r\nmy conduct would justify the alarm thus expressed. I was interested in\r\nthis, not only because Senator Platt was obviously sincere, but because\r\nof the way in which he used \"altruistic\" as a term of reproach, as if it\r\nwas Communistic or Socialistic--the last being a word he did use to me\r\nwhen, as now and then happened, he thought that my proposals warranted\r\nfairly reckless vituperation.\r\n\r\nSenator Platt's letter ran in part as follows:\r\n\r\n\"When the subject of your nomination was under consideration, there was\r\none matter that gave me real anxiety. I think you will have no\r\ntrouble in appreciating the fact that it was _not_ the matter of your\r\nindependence. I think we have got far enough along in our political\r\nacquaintance for you to see that my support in a convention does\r\nnot imply subsequent 'demands,' nor any other relation that may not\r\nreasonably exist for the welfare of the party. . . . The thing that did\r\nbother me was this: I had heard from a good many sources that you were\r\na little loose on the relations of capital and labor, on trusts and\r\ncombinations, and, indeed, on those numerous questions which have\r\nrecently arisen in politics affecting the security of earnings and the\r\nright of a man to run his own business in his own way, with due respect\r\nof course to the Ten Commandments and the Penal Code. Or, to get at it\r\neven more clearly, I understood from a number of business men, and among\r\nthem many of your own personal friends, that you entertained various\r\naltruistic ideas, all very well in their way, but which before they\r\ncould safely be put into law needed very profound consideration. . . .\r\nYou have just adjourned a Legislature which created a good opinion\r\nthroughout the State. I congratulate you heartily upon this fact because\r\nI sincerely believe, as everybody else does, that this good impression\r\nexists very largely as a result of your personal influence in the\r\nLegislative chambers. But at the last moment, and to my very great\r\nsurprise, you did a thing which has caused the business community of New\r\nYork to wonder how far the notions of Populism, as laid down in Kansas\r\nand Nebraska, have taken hold upon the Republican party of the State of\r\nNew York.\"\r\n\r\nIn my answer I pointed out to the Senator that I had as Governor\r\nunhesitatingly acted, at Buffalo and elsewhere, to put down mobs,\r\nwithout regard to the fact that the professed leaders of labor furiously\r\ndenounced me for so doing; but that I could no more tolerate wrong\r\ncommitted in the name of property than wrong committed against property.\r\nMy letter ran in part as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I knew that you had just the feelings that you describe; that is, apart\r\nfrom my 'impulsiveness,' you felt that there was a justifiable anxiety\r\namong men of means, and especially men representing large corporate\r\ninterests, lest I might feel too strongly on what you term the\r\n'altruistic' side in matters of labor and capital and as regards the\r\nrelations of the State to great corporations. . . . I know that when\r\nparties divide on such issues [as Bryanism] the tendency is to force\r\neverybody into one of two camps, and to throw out entirely men like\r\nmyself, who are as strongly opposed to Populism in every stage as the\r\ngreatest representative of corporate wealth, but who also feel strongly\r\nthat many of these representatives of enormous corporate wealth have\r\nthemselves been responsible for a portion of the conditions against\r\nwhich Bryanism is in ignorant revolt. I do not believe that it is wise\r\nor safe for us as a party to take refuge in mere negation and to\r\nsay that there are no evils to be corrected. It seems to me that our\r\nattitude should be one of correcting the evils and thereby showing that,\r\nwhereas the Populists, Socialists, and others really do not correct the\r\nevils at all, or else only do so at the expense of producing others in\r\naggravated form; on the contrary we Republicans hold the just balance\r\nand set ourselves as resolutely against improper corporate influence on\r\nthe one hand as against demagogy and mob rule on the other. I understand\r\nperfectly that such an attitude of moderation is apt to be misunderstood\r\nwhen passions are greatly excited and when victory is apt to rest with\r\nthe extremists on one side or the other; yet I think it is in the long\r\nrun the only wise attitude. . . . I appreciate absolutely [what Mr.\r\nPlatt had said] that any applause I get will be too evanescent for a\r\nmoment's consideration. I appreciate absolutely that the people who now\r\nloudly approve of my action in the franchise tax bill will forget all\r\nabout it in a fortnight, and that, on the other hand, the very powerful\r\ninterests adversely affected will always remember it. . . . [The\r\nleaders] urged upon me that I personally could not afford to take this\r\naction, for under no circumstances could I ever again be nominated for\r\nany public office, as no corporation would subscribe to a campaign fund\r\nif I was on the ticket, and that they would subscribe most heavily to\r\nbeat me; and when I asked if this were true of Republican corporations,\r\nthe cynical answer was made that the corporations that subscribed most\r\nheavily to the campaign funds subscribed impartially to both party\r\norganizations. Under all these circumstances, it seemed to me there\r\nwas no alternative but to do what I could to secure the passage of the\r\nbill.\"\r\n\r\nThese two letters, written in the spring of 1899, express clearly the\r\nviews of the two elements of the Republican party, whose hostility\r\ngradually grew until it culminated, thirteen years later. In 1912 the\r\npolitical and financial forces of which Mr. Platt had once been the\r\nspokesman, usurped the control of the party machinery and drove out of\r\nthe party the men who were loyally endeavoring to apply the principles\r\nof the founders of the party to the needs and issues of their own day.\r\n\r\nI had made up my mind that if I could get a show in the Legislature\r\nthe bill would pass, because the people had become interested and the\r\nrepresentatives would scarcely dare to vote the wrong way. Accordingly,\r\non April 27, 1899, I sent a special message to the Assembly, certifying\r\nthat the emergency demanded the immediate passage of the bill. The\r\nmachine leaders were bitterly angry, and the Speaker actually tore up\r\nthe message without reading it to the Assembly. That night they were\r\nbusy trying to arrange some device for the defeat of the bill--which\r\nwas not difficult, as the session was about to close. At seven the\r\nnext morning I was informed of what had occurred. At eight I was in the\r\nCapitol at the Executive chamber, and sent in another special message,\r\nwhich opened as follows: \"I learn that the emergency message which I\r\nsent last evening to the Assembly on behalf of the Franchise Tax Bill\r\nhas not been read. I therefore send hereby another message on the\r\nsubject. I need not impress upon the Assembly the need of passing this\r\nbill at once.\" I sent this message to the Assembly, by my secretary,\r\nWilliam J. Youngs, afterwards United States District Attorney of Kings,\r\nwith an intimation that if this were not promptly read I should come\r\nup in person and read it. Then, as so often happens, the opposition\r\ncollapsed and the bill went through both houses with a rush. I had in\r\nthe House stanch friends, such as Regis Post and Alford Cooley, men of\r\ncharacter and courage, who would have fought to a finish had the need\r\narisen.\r\n\r\nMy troubles were not at an end, however. The bill put the taxation in\r\nthe hands of the local county boards, and as the railways sometimes\r\npassed through several different counties, this was inadvisable. It was\r\nthe end of the session, and the Legislature adjourned. The corporations\r\naffected, through various counsel, and the different party leaders\r\nof both organizations, urged me not to sign the bill, laying especial\r\nstress on this feature, and asking that I wait until the following year,\r\nwhen a good measure could be put through with this obnoxious feature\r\nstruck out. I had thirty days under the law in which to sign the bill.\r\nIf I did not sign it by the end of that time it would not become a law.\r\nI answered my political and corporation friends by telling them that I\r\nagreed with them that this feature was wrong, but that I would rather\r\nhave the bill with this feature than not have it at all; and that I was\r\nnot willing to trust to what might be done a year later. Therefore, I\r\nexplained, I would reconvene the Legislature in special session, and if\r\nthe legislators chose to amend the bill by placing the power of taxation\r\nin the State instead of in the county or municipality, I would be glad;\r\nbut that if they failed to amend it, or amended it improperly, I would\r\nsign the original bill and let it become law as it was.\r\n\r\nWhen the representatives of Mr. Platt and of the corporations affected\r\nfound they could do no better, they assented to this proposition.\r\nEfforts were tentatively made to outwit me, by inserting amendments that\r\nwould nullify the effect of the law, or by withdrawing the law when the\r\nLegislature convened; which would at once have deprived me of the\r\nwhip hand. On May 12 I wrote Senator Platt, outlining the amendments I\r\ndesired, and said: \"Of course it must be understood that I will sign the\r\npresent bill if the proposed bill containing the changes outlined above\r\nfails to pass.\" On May 18 I notified the Senate leader, John Raines,\r\nby telegram: \"Legislature has no power to withdraw the Ford bill. If\r\nattempt is made to do so, I will sign the bill at once.\" On the same\r\nday, by telegram, I wired Mr. Odell concerning the bill the leaders were\r\npreparing: \"Some provisions of bill very objectionable. I am at work on\r\nbill to show you to-morrow. The bill must not contain greater changes\r\nthan those outlined in my message.\" My wishes were heeded, and when I\r\nhad reconvened the Legislature it amended the bill as I outlined in my\r\nmessage; and in its amended form the bill became law.\r\n\r\nThere promptly followed something which afforded an index of the good\r\nfaith of the corporations that had been protesting to me. As soon as the\r\nchange for which they had begged was inserted in the law, and the law\r\nwas signed, they turned round and refused to pay the taxes; and in the\r\nlawsuit that followed, they claimed that the law was unconstitutional,\r\nbecause it contained the very clause which they had so clamorously\r\ndemanded. Senator David B. Hill had appeared before me on behalf of the\r\ncorporations to argue for the change; and he then appeared before the\r\ncourts to make the argument on the other side. The suit was carried\r\nthrough to the Supreme Court of the United States, which declared the\r\nlaw constitutional during the time that I was President.\r\n\r\nOne of the painful duties of the chief executive in States like New\r\nYork, as well as in the Nation, is the refusing of pardons. Yet I can\r\nimagine nothing more necessary from the standpoint of good citizenship\r\nthan the ability to steel one's heart in this matter of granting\r\npardons. The pressure is always greatest in two classes of cases: first,\r\nthat where capital punishment is inflicted; second, that where the\r\nman is prominent socially and in the business world, and where in\r\nconsequence his crime is apt to have been one concerned in some way with\r\nfinance.\r\n\r\nAs regards capital cases, the trouble is that emotional men and women\r\nalways see only the individual whose fate is up at the moment, and\r\nneither his victim nor the many millions of unknown individuals who\r\nwould in the long run be harmed by what they ask. Moreover, almost any\r\ncriminal, however brutal, has usually some person, often a person whom\r\nhe has greatly wronged, who will plead for him. If the mother is alive\r\nshe will always come, and she cannot help feeling that the case in which\r\nshe is so concerned is peculiar, that in this case a pardon should be\r\ngranted. It was really heartrending to have to see the kinsfolk and\r\nfriends of murderers who were condemned to death, and among the very\r\nrare occasions when anything governmental or official caused me to lose\r\nsleep were the times when I had to listen to some poor mother making a\r\nplea for a criminal so wicked, so utterly brutal and depraved, that it\r\nwould have been a crime on my part to remit his punishment.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there were certain crimes where requests for leniency\r\nmerely made me angry. Such crimes were, for instance, rape, or the\r\ncirculation of indecent literature, or anything connected with what\r\nwould now be called the \"white slave\" traffic, or wife murder, or gross\r\ncruelty to women and children, or seduction and abandonment, or the\r\naction of some man in getting a girl whom he had seduced to commit\r\nabortion. I am speaking in each instance of cases that actually came\r\nbefore me, either while I was Governor or while I was President. In an\r\nastonishing number of these cases men of high standing signed petitions\r\nor wrote letters asking me to show leniency to the criminal. In two or\r\nthree of the cases--one where some young roughs had committed rape on a\r\nhelpless immigrant girl, and another in which a physician of wealth\r\nand high standing had seduced a girl and then induced her to commit\r\nabortion--I rather lost my temper, and wrote to the individuals who had\r\nasked for the pardon, saying that I extremely regretted that it was\r\nnot in my power to increase the sentence. I then let the facts be made\r\npublic, for I thought that my petitioners deserved public censure.\r\nWhether they received this public censure or not I did not know, but\r\nthat my action made them very angry I do know, and their anger gave me\r\nreal satisfaction. The list of these petitioners was a fairly long one,\r\nand included two United States Senators, a Governor of a State, two\r\njudges, an editor, and some eminent lawyers and business men.\r\n\r\nIn the class of cases where the offense was one involving the misuse of\r\nlarge sums of money the reason for the pressure was different. Cases of\r\nthis kind more frequently came before me when I was President, but they\r\nalso came before me when I was Governor, chiefly in the cases of county\r\ntreasurers who had embezzled funds. A big bank president, a railway\r\nmagnate, an official connected with some big corporation, or a\r\nGovernment official in a responsible fiduciary position, necessarily\r\nbelongs among the men who have succeeded in life. This means that his\r\nfamily are living in comfort, and perhaps luxury and refinement, and\r\nthat his sons and daughters have been well educated. In such a case\r\nthe misdeed of the father comes as a crushing disaster to the wife and\r\nchildren, and the people of the community, however bitter originally\r\nagainst the man, grow to feel the most intense sympathy for the\r\nbowed-down women and children who suffer for the man's fault. It is\r\na dreadful thing in life that so much of atonement for wrong-doing\r\nis vicarious. If it were possible in such a case to think only of the\r\nbanker's or county treasurer's wife and children, any man would pardon\r\nthe offender at once. Unfortunately, it is not right to think only of\r\nthe women and children. The very fact that in cases of this class there\r\nis certain to be pressure from high sources, pressure sometimes by men\r\nwho have been beneficially, even though remotely, interested in the\r\nman's criminality, no less than pressure because of honest sympathy with\r\nthe wife and children, makes it necessary that the good public servant\r\nshall, no matter how deep his sympathy and regret, steel his heart and\r\ndo his duty by refusing to let the wrong-doer out. My experience of the\r\nway in which pardons are often granted is one of the reasons why I\r\ndo not believe that life imprisonment for murder and rape is a proper\r\nsubstitute for the death penalty. The average term of so-called life\r\nimprisonment in this country is only about fourteen years.\r\n\r\nOf course there were cases where I either commuted sentences or pardoned\r\noffenders with very real pleasure. For instance, when President, I\r\nfrequently commuted sentences for horse stealing in the Indian Territory\r\nbecause the penalty for stealing a horse was disproportionate to the\r\npenalty for many other crimes, and the offense was usually committed by\r\nsome ignorant young fellow who found a half-wild horse, and really did\r\nnot commit anything like as serious an offense as the penalty indicated.\r\nThe judges would be obliged to give the minimum penalty, but would\r\nforward me memoranda stating that if there had been a less penalty they\r\nwould have inflicted it, and I would then commute the sentence to the\r\npenalty thus indicated.\r\n\r\nIn one case in New York I pardoned outright a man convicted of murder\r\nin the second degree, and I did this on the recommendation of a friend,\r\nFather Doyle of the Paulist Fathers. I had become intimate with the\r\nPaulist Fathers while I was Police Commissioner, and I had grown to feel\r\nconfidence in their judgment, for I had found that they always told me\r\nexactly what the facts were about any man, whether he belonged to their\r\nchurch or not. In this case the convicted man was a strongly built,\r\nrespectable old Irishman employed as a watchman around some big\r\ncattle-killing establishments. The young roughs of the neighborhood,\r\nwhich was then of a rather lawless type, used to try to destroy the\r\nproperty of the companies. In a conflict with a watchman a member of one\r\nof the gangs was slain. The watchman was acquitted, but the neighborhood\r\nwas much wrought up over the acquittal. Shortly afterwards, a gang of\r\nthe same roughs attacked another watchman, the old Irishman in question,\r\nand finally, to save his own life, he was obliged in self-defense to\r\nkill one of his assailants. The feeling in the community, however, was\r\nstrongly against him, and some of the men high up in the corporation\r\nbecame frightened and thought that it would be better to throw over the\r\nwatchman. He was convicted. Father Doyle came to me, told me that he\r\nknew the man well, that he was one of the best members of his church,\r\nadmirable in every way, that he had simply been forced to fight for his\r\nlife while loyally doing his duty, and that the conviction represented\r\nthe triumph of the tough element of the district and the abandonment of\r\nthis man, by those who should have stood by him, under the influence of\r\nan unworthy fear. I looked into the case, came to the conclusion that\r\nFather Doyle was right, and gave the man a full pardon before he had\r\nserved thirty days.\r\n\r\nThe various clashes between myself and the machine, my triumph in them,\r\nand the fact that the people were getting more and more interested\r\nand aroused, brought on a curious situation in the Republican National\r\nConvention at Philadelphia in June, 1900. Senator Platt and the New\r\nYork machine leaders had become very anxious to get me out of the\r\nGovernorship, chiefly because of the hostility of the big corporation\r\nmen towards me; but they had also become convinced that there was such\r\npopular feeling on my behalf that it would be difficult to refuse me a\r\nrenomination if I demanded it. They accordingly decided to push me for\r\nVice-President, taking advantage of the fact that there was at that time\r\na good deal of feeling for me in the country at large. [See Appendix B\r\nto this chapter.] I myself did not appreciate that there was any such\r\nfeeling, and as I greatly disliked the office of Vice-President and was\r\nmuch interested in the Governorship, I announced that I would not accept\r\nthe Vice-Presidency. I was one of the delegates to Philadelphia. On\r\nreaching there I found that the situation was complicated. Senator\r\nHanna appeared on the surface to have control of the Convention. He was\r\nanxious that I should not be nominated as Vice-President. Senator Platt\r\nwas anxious that I should be nominated as Vice-President, in order to\r\nget me out of the New York Governorship. Each took a position opposite\r\nto that of the other, but each at that time cordially sympathized with\r\nthe other's feelings about me--it was the manifestations and not the\r\nfeelings that differed. My supporters in New York State did not wish\r\nme nominated for Vice-President because they wished me to continue as\r\nGovernor; but in every other State all the people who admired me were\r\nbound that I should be nominated as Vice-President. These people were\r\nalmost all desirous of seeing Mr. McKinley renominated as President, but\r\nthey became angry at Senator Hanna's opposition to me as Vice-President.\r\nHe in his turn suddenly became aware that if he persisted he might find\r\nthat in their anger these men would oppose Mr. McKinley's renomination,\r\nand although they could not have prevented the nomination, such\r\nopposition would have been a serious blow in the campaign which was to\r\nfollow. Senator Hanna, therefore, began to waver.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a meeting of the New York delegation was called. Most of the\r\ndelegates were under the control of Senator Platt. The Senator notified\r\nme that if I refused to accept the nomination for Vice-President I\r\nwould be beaten for the nomination for Governor. I answered that I would\r\naccept the challenge, that we would have a straight-out fight on the\r\nproposition, and that I would begin it at once by telling the assembled\r\ndelegates of the threat, and giving fair warning that I intended to\r\nfight for the Governorship nomination, and, moreover, that I intended to\r\nget it. This brought Senator Platt to terms. The effort to instruct\r\nthe New York delegation for me was abandoned, and Lieutenant-Governor\r\nWoodruff was presented for nomination in my place.\r\n\r\nI supposed that this closed the incident, and that no further effort\r\nwould be made to nominate me for the Vice-Presidency. On the contrary,\r\nthe effect was directly the reverse. The upset of the New York machine\r\nincreased the feeling of the delegates from other States that it was\r\nnecessary to draft me for the nomination. By next day Senator Hanna\r\nhimself concluded that this was a necessity, and acquiesced in the\r\nmovement. As New York was already committed against me, and as I was\r\nnot willing that there should be any chance of supposing that the New\r\nYorkers had nominated me to get rid of me, the result was that I was\r\nnominated and seconded from outside States. No other candidate was\r\nplaced in the field.\r\n\r\nBy this time the Legislature had adjourned, and most of my work as\r\nGovernor of New York was over. One unexpected bit of business arose,\r\nhowever. It was the year of the Presidential campaign. Tammany, which\r\nhad been lukewarm about Bryan in 1896, cordially supported him in\r\n1900; and when Tammany heartily supports a candidate it is well for the\r\nopposing candidate to keep a sharp lookout for election frauds. The city\r\ngovernment was in the hands of Tammany; but I had power to remove\r\nthe Mayor, the Sheriff, and the District Attorney for malfeasance or\r\nmisfeasance in office. Such power had not been exercised by any previous\r\nGovernor, as far as I knew; but it existed, and if the misfeasance or\r\nmalfeasance warranted it, and if the Governor possessed the requisite\r\ndetermination, the power could be, and ought to be, exercised.\r\n\r\nBy an Act of the Legislature, a State Bureau of Elections had been\r\ncreated in New York City, and a Superintendent of Elections appointed\r\nby the Governor. The Chief of the State Bureau of Elections was\r\nJohn McCullagh, formerly in the Police Department when I was Police\r\nCommissioner. The Chief of Police for the city was William F. Devery,\r\none of the Tammany leaders, who represented in the Police Department\r\nall that I had warred against while Commissioner. On November 4 Devery\r\ndirected his subordinates in the Police Department to disregard the\r\norders which McCullagh had given to his deputies, orders which were\r\nessential if we were to secure an honest election in the city. I had\r\njust returned from a Western campaign trip, and was at Sagamore Hill. I\r\nhad no direct power over Devery; but the Mayor had; and I had power over\r\nthe Mayor. Accordingly, I at once wrote to the Mayor of New York, to the\r\nSheriff of New York, and to the District Attorney of New York County the\r\nfollowing letters:\r\n\r\nSTATE OF NEW YORK OYSTER BAY, November 5, 1900.\r\n\r\nTo the Mayor of the City of New York.\r\n\r\nSir: My attention has been called to the official order issued by Chief\r\nof Police Devery, in which he directs his subordinates to disregard the\r\nChief of the State Election Bureau, John McCullagh, and his deputies.\r\nUnless you have already taken steps to secure the recall of this order,\r\nit is necessary for me to point out that I shall be obliged to hold you\r\nresponsible as the head of the city government for the action of the\r\nChief of Police, if it should result in any breach of the peace and\r\nintimidation or any crime whatever against the election laws. The State\r\nand city authorities should work together. I will not fail to call to\r\nsummary account either State or city authority in the event of either\r\nbeing guilty of intimidation or connivance at fraud or of failure to\r\nprotect every legal voter in his rights. I therefore hereby notify\r\nyou that in the event of any wrong-doing following upon the failure\r\nimmediately to recall Chief Devery's order, or upon any action or\r\ninaction on the part of Chief Devery, I must necessarily call you to\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nYours, etc., THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OF NEW YORK OYSTER BAY, November 5, 1900.\r\n\r\nTo the Sheriff of the County of New York.\r\n\r\nSir: My attention has been called to the official order issued by Chief\r\nof Police Devery in which he directs his subordinates to disregard the\r\nChief of the State Election Bureau, John McCullagh, and his deputies.\r\n\r\nIt is your duty to assist in the orderly enforcement of the law, and I\r\nshall hold you strictly responsible for any breach of the public peace\r\nwithin your county, or for any failure on your part to do your full duty\r\nin connection with the election to-morrow.\r\n\r\nYours truly, THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OF NEW YORK OYSTER BAY, November 5, 1900.\r\n\r\nTo the District Attorney of the County of New York.\r\n\r\nSir: My attention has been called to the official order issued by Chief\r\nof Police Devery, in which he directs his subordinates to disregard the\r\nChief of the State Election Bureau, John McCullagh, and his deputies.\r\n\r\nIn view of this order I call your attention to the fact that it is your\r\nduty to assist in the orderly enforcement of the law, and there must be\r\nno failure on your part to do your full duty in the matter.\r\n\r\nYours truly, THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\nThese letters had the desired effect. The Mayor promptly required Chief\r\nDevery to rescind the obnoxious order, which was as promptly done. The\r\nSheriff also took prompt action. The District Attorney refused to heed\r\nmy letter, and assumed an attitude of defiance, and I removed him from\r\noffice. On election day there was no clash between the city and State\r\nauthorities; the election was orderly and honest.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A\r\n\r\nCONSERVATION\r\n\r\nAs foreshadowing the course I later, as President, followed in this\r\nmatter, I give extracts from one of my letters to the Commission, and\r\nfrom my second (and last) Annual Message. I spent the first months of my\r\nterm in investigations to find out just what the situation was.\r\n\r\nOn November 28, 1899, I wrote to the Commission as follows:\r\n\r\n\". . . I have had very many complaints before this as to the\r\ninefficiency of the game wardens and game protectors, the complaints\r\nusually taking the form that the men have been appointed and are\r\nretained without due regard to the duties to be performed. I do not wish\r\na man to be retained or appointed who is not thoroughly fit to perform\r\nthe duties of game protector. The Adirondacks are entitled to a peculiar\r\nshare of the Commission's attention, both from the standpoint of\r\nforestry, and from the less important, but still very important,\r\nstandpoint of game and fish protection. The men who do duty as game\r\nprotectors in the Adirondacks should, by preference, be appointed from\r\nthe locality itself, and should in all cases be thorough woodsmen. The\r\nmere fact that a game protector has to hire a guide to pilot him through\r\nthe woods is enough to show his unfitness for the position. I want\r\nas game protectors men of courage, resolution, and hardihood, who can\r\nhandle the rifle, ax, and paddle; who can camp out in summer or winter;\r\nwho can go on snow-shoes, if necessary; who can go through the woods by\r\nday or by night without regard to trails.\r\n\r\n\"I should like full information about all your employees, as to their\r\ncapacities, as to the labor they perform, as to their distribution from\r\nand where they do their work.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the men hitherto appointed owed their positions principally to\r\npolitical preference. The changes I recommended were promptly made,\r\nand much to the good of the public service. In my Annual Message, in\r\nJanuary, 1900, I said:\r\n\r\n\"Great progress has been made through the fish hatcheries in the\r\npropagation of valuable food and sporting fish. The laws for the\r\nprotection of deer have resulted in their increase. Nevertheless, as\r\nrailroads tend to encroach on the wilderness, the temptation to illegal\r\nhunting becomes greater, and the danger from forest fires increases.\r\nThere is need of great improvement both in our laws and in their\r\nadministration. The game wardens have been too few in number. More\r\nshould be provided. None save fit men must be appointed; and their\r\nretention in office must depend purely upon the zeal, ability, and\r\nefficiency with which they perform their duties. The game wardens in the\r\nforests must be woodsmen; and they should have no outside business.\r\nIn short, there should be a thorough reorganization of the work of\r\nthe Commission. A careful study of the resources and condition of the\r\nforests on State land must be made. It is certainly not too much to\r\nexpect that the State forests should be managed as efficiently as the\r\nforests on private lands in the same neighborhoods. And the measure\r\nof difference in efficiency of management must be the measure of\r\ncondemnation or praise of the way the public forests have been managed.\r\n\r\n\"The subject of forest preservation is of the utmost importance to\r\nthe State. The Adirondacks and Catskills should be great parks kept in\r\nperpetuity for the benefit and enjoyment of our people. Much has been\r\ndone of late years towards their preservation, but very much remains to\r\nbe done. The provisions of law in reference to sawmills and wood-pulp\r\nmills are defective and should be changed so as to prohibit dumping\r\ndye-stuff, sawdust, or tan-bark, in any amount whatsoever, into the\r\nstreams. Reservoirs should be made, but not where they will tend to\r\ndestroy large sections of the forest, and only after a careful and\r\nscientific study of the water resources of the region. The people of\r\nthe forest regions are themselves growing more and more to realize the\r\nnecessity of preserving both the trees and the game. A live deer in the\r\nwoods will attract to the neighborhood ten times the money that could\r\nbe obtained for the deer's dead carcass. Timber theft on the State lands\r\nis, of course, a grave offense against the whole public.\r\n\r\n\"Hardy outdoor sports, like hunting, are in themselves of no small value\r\nto the National character and should be encouraged in every way. Men who\r\ngo into the wilderness, indeed, men who take part in any field sports\r\nwith horse or rifle, receive a benefit which can hardly be given by even\r\nthe most vigorous athletic games.\r\n\r\n\"There is a further and more immediate and practical end in view. A\r\nprimeval forest is a great sponge which absorbs and distills the rain\r\nwater. And when it is destroyed the result is apt to be an alternation\r\nof flood and drought. Forest fires ultimately make the land a desert,\r\nand are a detriment to all that portion of the State tributary to the\r\nstreams through the woods where they occur. Every effort should be made\r\nto minimize their destructive influence. We need to have our system of\r\nforestry gradually developed and conducted along scientific principles.\r\nWhen this has been done it will be possible to allow marketable lumber\r\nto be cut everywhere without damage to the forests--indeed, with\r\npositive advantage to them. But until lumbering is thus conducted,\r\non strictly scientific principles no less than upon principles of the\r\nstrictest honesty toward the State, we cannot afford to suffer it at\r\nall in the State forests. Unrestrained greed means the ruin of the great\r\nwoods and the drying up of the sources of the rivers.\r\n\r\n\"Ultimately the administration of the State lands must be so centralized\r\nas to enable us definitely to place responsibility in respect to\r\neverything concerning them, and to demand the highest degree of trained\r\nintelligence in their use.\r\n\r\n\"The State should not permit within its limits factories to make bird\r\nskins or bird feathers into articles of ornament or wearing apparel.\r\nOrdinary birds, and especially song birds, should be rigidly protected.\r\nGame birds should never be shot to a greater extent than will offset the\r\nnatural rate of increase. . . . Care should be taken not to encourage\r\nthe use of cold storage or other market systems which are a benefit to\r\nno one but the wealthy epicure who can afford to pay a heavy price for\r\nluxuries. These systems tend to the destruction of the game, which would\r\nbear most severely upon the very men whose rapacity has been appealed to\r\nin order to secure its extermination. . . .\"\r\n\r\nI reorganized the Commission, putting Austin Wadsworth at its head.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B\r\n\r\nTHE POLITICAL SITUATION IN 1900\r\n\r\nMy general scheme of action as Governor was given in a letter I wrote\r\none of my supporters among the independent district organization\r\nleaders, Norton Goddard, on April 16, 1900. It runs in part as follows:\r\n\"Nobody can tell, and least of all the machine itself, whether the\r\nmachine intends to renominate me next fall or not. If for some reason I\r\nshould be weak, whether on account of faults or virtues, doubtless the\r\nmachine will throw me over, and I think I am not uncharitable when I say\r\nthey would feel no acute grief at so doing. It would be very strange if\r\nthey did feel such grief. If, for instance, we had strikes which led\r\nto riots, I would of course be obliged to preserve order and stop the\r\nriots. Decent citizens would demand that I should do it, and in any\r\nevent I should do it wholly without regard to their demands. But, once\r\nit was done, they would forget all about it, while a great many laboring\r\nmen, honest but ignorant and prejudiced, would bear a grudge against\r\nme for doing it. This might put me out of the running as a candidate.\r\nAgain, the big corporations undoubtedly want to beat me. They prefer\r\nthe chance of being blackmailed to the certainty that they will not be\r\nallowed any more than their due. Of course they will try to beat me\r\non some entirely different issue, and, as they are very able and very\r\nunscrupulous, nobody can tell that they won't succeed. . . . I have been\r\ntrying to stay in with the organization. I did not do it with the idea\r\nthat they would renominate me. I did it with the idea of getting things\r\ndone, and in that I have been absolutely successful. Whether Senator\r\nPlatt and Mr. Odell endeavor to beat me, or do beat me, for the\r\nrenomination next fall, is of very small importance compared to the fact\r\nthat for my two years I have been able to make a Republican majority\r\nin the Legislature do good and decent work and have prevented any split\r\nwithin the party. The task was one of great difficulty, because, on the\r\none hand, I had to keep clearly before me the fact that it was better to\r\nhave a split than to permit bad work to be done, and, on the other hand,\r\nthe fact that to have that split would absolutely prevent all _good_\r\nwork. The result has been that I have avoided a split and that as a net\r\nresult of my two years and the two sessions of the Legislature,\r\nthere has been an enormous improvement in the administration of the\r\nGovernment, and there has also been a great advance in legislation.\"\r\n\r\nTo show my reading of the situation at the time I quote from a letter\r\nof mine to Joseph B. Bishop, then editor of the _Commercial Advertiser_,\r\nwith whom towards the end of my term I had grown into very close\r\nrelations, and who, together with two other old friends, Albert Shaw,\r\nof the _Review of Reviews_, and Silas McBee, now editor of the\r\n_Constructive Quarterly_, knew the inside of every movement, so far as I\r\nknew it myself. The letter, which is dated April 11, 1900, runs in part\r\nas follows: \"The dangerous element as far as I am concerned comes from\r\nthe corporations. The [naming certain men] crowd and those like them\r\nhave been greatly exasperated by the franchise tax. They would like to\r\nget me out of politics for good, but at the moment they think the best\r\nthing to do is to put me into the Vice-Presidency. Naturally I will\r\nnot be opposed openly on the ground of the corporations' grievance; but\r\nevery kind of false statement will continually be made, and men like\r\n[naming the editors of certain newspapers] will attack me, not as the\r\nenemy of corporations, but as their tool! There is no question whatever\r\nthat if the leaders can they will upset me.\"\r\n\r\nOne position which as Governor (and as President) I consistently took,\r\nseems to me to represent what ought to be a fundamental principle in\r\nAmerican legislative work. I steadfastly refused to advocate any law, no\r\nmatter how admirable in theory, if there was good reason to believe that\r\nin practice it would not be executed. I have always sympathized with the\r\nview set forth by Pelatiah Webster in 1783--quoted by Hannis Taylor\r\nin his _Genesis of the Supreme Court_--\"Laws or ordinances of any kind\r\n(especially of august bodies of high dignity and consequence) which\r\nfail of execution, are much worse than none. They weaken the government,\r\nexpose it to contempt, destroy the confidence of all men, native and\r\nforeigners, in it, and expose both aggregate bodies and individuals who\r\nhave placed confidence in it to many ruinous disappointments which\r\nthey would have escaped had no such law or ordinance been made.\" This\r\nprinciple, by the way, not only applies to an internal law which cannot\r\nbe executed; it applies even more to international action, such as a\r\nuniversal arbitration treaty which cannot and will not be kept; and\r\nmost of all it applies to proposals to make such universal arbitration\r\ntreaties at the very time that we are not keeping our solemn promise\r\nto execute limited arbitration treaties which we have already made. A\r\ngeneral arbitration treaty is merely a promise; it represents merely a\r\ndebt of honorable obligation; and nothing is more discreditable, for\r\na nation or an individual, than to cover up the repudiation of a debt\r\nwhich can be and ought to be paid, by recklessly promising to incur a\r\nnew and insecure debt which no wise man for one moment supposes ever\r\nwill be paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nOUTDOORS AND INDOORS\r\n\r\nThere are men who love out-of-doors who yet never open a book; and other\r\nmen who love books but to whom the great book of nature is a\r\nsealed volume, and the lines written therein blurred and illegible.\r\nNevertheless among those men whom I have known the love of books and the\r\nlove of outdoors, in their highest expressions, have usually gone hand\r\nin hand. It is an affectation for the man who is praising outdoors to\r\nsneer at books. Usually the keenest appreciation of what is seen in\r\nnature is to be found in those who have also profited by the hoarded\r\nand recorded wisdom of their fellow-men. Love of outdoor life, love of\r\nsimple and hardy pastimes, can be gratified by men and women who do\r\nnot possess large means, and who work hard; and so can love of good\r\nbooks--not of good bindings and of first editions, excellent enough in\r\ntheir way but sheer luxuries--I mean love of reading books, owning them\r\nif possible of course, but, if that is not possible, getting them from a\r\ncirculating library.\r\n\r\nSagamore Hill takes its name from the old Sagamore Mohannis, who,\r\nas chief of his little tribe, signed away his rights to the land two\r\ncenturies and a half ago. The house stands right on the top of the hill,\r\nseparated by fields and belts of woodland from all other houses, and\r\nlooks out over the bay and the Sound. We see the sun go down beyond long\r\nreaches of land and of water. Many birds dwell in the trees round the\r\nhouse or in the pastures and the woods near by, and of course in winter\r\ngulls, loons, and wild fowl frequent the waters of the bay and the\r\nSound. We love all the seasons; the snows and bare woods of winter;\r\nthe rush of growing things and the blossom-spray of spring; the yellow\r\ngrain, the ripening fruits and tasseled corn, and the deep, leafy shades\r\nthat are heralded by \"the green dance of summer\"; and the sharp fall\r\nwinds that tear the brilliant banners with which the trees greet the\r\ndying year.\r\n\r\nThe Sound is always lovely. In the summer nights we watch it from the\r\npiazza, and see the lights of the tall Fall River boats as they steam\r\nsteadily by. Now and then we spend a day on it, the two of us together\r\nin the light rowing skiff, or perhaps with one of the boys to pull an\r\nextra pair of oars; we land for lunch at noon under wind-beaten oaks\r\non the edge of a low bluff, or among the wild plum bushes on a spit\r\nof white sand, while the sails of the coasting schooners gleam in the\r\nsunlight, and the tolling of the bell-buoy comes landward across the\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nLong Island is not as rich in flowers as the valley of the Hudson. Yet\r\nthere are many. Early in April there is one hillside near us which glows\r\nlike a tender flame with the white of the bloodroot. About the same time\r\nwe find the shy mayflower, the trailing arbutus; and although we rarely\r\npick wild flowers, one member of the household always plucks a little\r\nbunch of mayflowers to send to a friend working in Panama, whose soul\r\nhungers for the Northern spring. Then there are shadblow and delicate\r\nanemones, about the time of the cherry blossoms; the brief glory of the\r\napple orchards follows; and then the thronging dogwoods fill the forests\r\nwith their radiance; and so flowers follow flowers until the springtime\r\nsplendor closes with the laurel and the evanescent, honey-sweet locust\r\nbloom. The late summer flowers follow, the flaunting lilies, and\r\ncardinal flowers, and marshmallows, and pale beach rosemary; and the\r\ngoldenrod and the asters when the afternoons shorten and we again begin\r\nto think of fires in the wide fireplaces.\r\n\r\nMost of the birds in our neighborhood are the ordinary home friends of\r\nthe house and the barn, the wood lot and the pasture; but now and then\r\nthe species make queer shifts. The cheery quail, alas! are rarely found\r\nnear us now; and we no longer hear the whip-poor-wills at night. But\r\nsome birds visit us now which formerly did not. When I was a boy neither\r\nthe black-throated green warbler nor the purple finch nested around us,\r\nnor were bobolinks found in our fields. The black-throated green warbler\r\nis now one of our commonest summer warblers; there are plenty of purple\r\nfinches; and, best of all, the bobolinks are far from infrequent. I had\r\nwritten about these new visitors to John Burroughs, and once when he\r\ncame out to see me I was able to show them to him.\r\n\r\nWhen I was President, we owned a little house in western Virginia; a\r\ndelightful house, to us at least, although only a shell of rough boards.\r\nWe used sometimes to go there in the fall, perhaps at Thanksgiving, and\r\non these occasions we would have quail and rabbits of our own shooting,\r\nand once in a while a wild turkey. We also went there in the spring. Of\r\ncourse many of the birds were different from our Long Island friends.\r\nThere were mocking-birds, the most attractive of all birds, and blue\r\ngrosbeaks, and cardinals and summer redbirds, instead of scarlet\r\ntanagers, and those wonderful singers the Bewick's wrens, and Carolina\r\nwrens. All these I was able to show John Burroughs when he came to visit\r\nus; although, by the way, he did not appreciate as much as we did one\r\nset of inmates of the cottage--the flying squirrels. We loved having the\r\nflying squirrels, father and mother and half-grown young, in their nest\r\namong the rafters; and at night we slept so soundly that we did not in\r\nthe least mind the wild gambols of the little fellows through the rooms,\r\neven when, as sometimes happened, they would swoop down to the bed and\r\nscuttle across it.\r\n\r\nOne April I went to Yellowstone Park, when the snow was still very deep,\r\nand I took John Burroughs with me. I wished to show him the big game of\r\nthe Park, the wild creatures that have become so astonishingly tame and\r\ntolerant of human presence. In the Yellowstone the animals seem always\r\nto behave as one wishes them to! It is always possible to see the sheep\r\nand deer and antelope, and also the great herds of elk, which are shyer\r\nthan the smaller beasts. In April we found the elk weak after the\r\nshort commons and hard living of winter. Once without much difficulty\r\nI regularly rounded up a big band of them, so that John Burroughs could\r\nlook at them. I do not think, however, that he cared to see them as much\r\nas I did. The birds interested him more, especially a tiny owl the size\r\nof a robin which we saw perched on the top of a tree in mid-afternoon\r\nentirely uninfluenced by the sun and making a queer noise like a cork\r\nbeing pulled from a bottle. I was rather ashamed to find how much\r\nbetter his eyes were than mine in seeing the birds and grasping their\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\nWhen wolf-hunting in Texas, and when bear-hunting in Louisiana and\r\nMississippi, I was not only enthralled by the sport, but also by the\r\nstrange new birds and other creatures, and the trees and flowers I had\r\nnot known before. By the way, there was one feast at the White House\r\nwhich stands above all others in my memory--even above the time when\r\nI lured Joel Chandler Harris thither for a night, a deed in which to\r\ntriumph, as all who knew that inveterately shy recluse will testify.\r\nThis was \"the bear-hunters' dinner.\" I had been treated so kindly by my\r\nfriends on these hunts, and they were such fine fellows, men whom I was\r\nso proud to think of as Americans, that I set my heart on having them\r\nat a hunters' dinner at the White House. One December I succeeded; there\r\nwere twenty or thirty of them, all told, as good hunters, as daring\r\nriders, as first-class citizens as could be found anywhere; no finer set\r\nof guests ever sat at meat in the White House; and among other game\r\non the table was a black bear, itself contributed by one of these same\r\nguests.\r\n\r\nWhen I first visited California, it was my good fortune to see the \"big\r\ntrees,\" the Sequoias, and then to travel down into the Yosemite, with\r\nJohn Muir. Of course of all people in the world he was the one with whom\r\nit was best worth while thus to see the Yosemite. He told me that when\r\nEmerson came to California he tried to get him to come out and camp with\r\nhim, for that was the only way in which to see at their best the majesty\r\nand charm of the Sierras. But at the time Emerson was getting old and\r\ncould not go. John Muir met me with a couple of packers and two mules\r\nto carry our tent, bedding, and food for a three days' trip. The first\r\nnight was clear, and we lay down in the darkening aisles of the great\r\nSequoia grove. The majestic trunks, beautiful in color and in symmetry,\r\nrose round us like the pillars of a mightier cathedral than ever was\r\nconceived even by the fervor of the Middle Ages. Hermit thrushes sang\r\nbeautifully in the evening, and again, with a burst of wonderful music,\r\nat dawn. I was interested and a little surprised to find that, unlike\r\nJohn Burroughs, John Muir cared little for birds or bird songs, and knew\r\nlittle about them. The hermit-thrushes meant nothing to him, the trees\r\nand the flowers and the cliffs everything. The only birds he noticed\r\nor cared for were some that were very conspicuous, such as the\r\nwater-ousels--always particular favorites of mine too. The second night\r\nwe camped in a snow-storm, on the edge of the canyon walls, under the\r\nspreading limbs of a grove of mighty silver fir; and next day we went\r\ndown into the wonderland of the valley itself. I shall always be glad\r\nthat I was in the Yosemite with John Muir and in the Yellowstone with\r\nJohn Burroughs.\r\n\r\nLike most Americans interested in birds and books, I know a good\r\ndeal about English birds as they appear in books. I know the lark of\r\nShakespeare and Shelley and the Ettrick Shepherd; I know the nightingale\r\nof Milton and Keats; I know Wordsworth's cuckoo; I know mavis and merle\r\nsinging in the merry green wood of the old ballads; I know Jenny Wren\r\nand Cock Robin of the nursery books. Therefore I had always much desired\r\nto hear the birds in real life; and the opportunity offered in June,\r\n1910, when I spent two or three weeks in England. As I could snatch but\r\na few hours from a very exciting round of pleasures and duties, it was\r\nnecessary for me to be with some companion who could identify both song\r\nand singer. In Sir Edward Grey, a keen lover of outdoor life in all\r\nits phases, and a delightful companion, who knows the songs and ways of\r\nEnglish birds as very few do know them, I found the best possible guide.\r\n\r\nWe left London on the morning of June 9, twenty-four hours before I\r\nsailed from Southampton. Getting off the train at Basingstoke, we drove\r\nto the pretty, smiling valley of the Itchen. Here we tramped for three\r\nor four hours, then again drove, this time to the edge of the New\r\nForest, where we first took tea at an inn, and then tramped through the\r\nforest to an inn on its other side, at Brockenhurst. At the conclusion\r\nof our walk my companion made a list of the birds we had seen, putting\r\nan asterisk (*) opposite those which we had heard sing. There were\r\nforty-one of the former and twenty-three of the latter, as follows:\r\n\r\n     * Thrush, * blackbird, * lark, * yellowhammer, * robin,\r\n     *wren, * golden-crested wren, * goldfinch, * chaffinch, *\r\n     *greenfinch, pied wagtail, sparrow, * dunnock (hedge,\r\n     accentor), missel thrush, starling, rook, jackdaw,\r\n     *blackcap, * garden warbler, * willow warbler, * chiffchaff,\r\n     * wood warbler, tree-creeper, * reed bunting, * sedge\r\n     warbler, coot, water hen, little grebe (dabchick), tufted\r\n     duck, wood pigeon, stock dove, * turtle dove, peewit, tit (?\r\n     coal-tit), * cuckoo, * nightjar, * swallow, martin, swift,\r\n     pheasant, partridge.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Itchen is typically the England that we know from\r\nnovel and story and essay. It is very beautiful in every way, with a\r\nrich, civilized, fertile beauty--the rapid brook twisting among its reed\r\nbeds, the rich green of trees and grass, the stately woods, the gardens\r\nand fields, the exceedingly picturesque cottages, the great handsome\r\nhouses standing in their parks. Birds were plentiful; I know but few\r\nplaces in America where one would see such an abundance of individuals,\r\nand I was struck by seeing such large birds as coots, water hens,\r\ngrebes, tufted ducks, pigeons, and peewits. In places in America as\r\nthickly settled as the valley of the Itchen, I should not expect to see\r\nany like number of birds of this size; but I hope that the efforts of\r\nthe Audubon societies and kindred organizations will gradually make\r\nthemselves felt until it becomes a point of honor not only with the\r\nAmerican man, but with the American small boy, to shield and protect all\r\nforms of harmless wild life. True sportsmen should take the lead in such\r\na movement, for if there is to be any shooting there must be something\r\nto shoot; the prime necessity is to keep, and not kill out, even the\r\nbirds which in legitimate numbers may be shot.\r\n\r\nThe New Forest is a wild, uninhabited stretch of heath and woodland,\r\nmany of the trees gnarled and aged, and its very wildness, the lack of\r\ncultivation, the ruggedness, made it strongly attractive in my eyes, and\r\nsuggested my own country. The birds of course were much less plentiful\r\nthan beside the Itchen.\r\n\r\nThe bird that most impressed me on my walk was the blackbird. I had\r\nalready heard nightingales in abundance near Lake Como, and had also\r\nlistened to larks, but I had never heard either the blackbird, the song\r\nthrush, or the blackcap warbler; and while I knew that all three were\r\ngood singers, I did not know what really beautiful singers they were.\r\nBlackbirds were very abundant, and they played a prominent part in the\r\nchorus which we heard throughout the day on every hand, though perhaps\r\nloudest the following morning at dawn. In its habits and manners the\r\nblackbird strikingly resembles our American robin, and indeed looks\r\nexactly like a robin, with a yellow bill and coal-black plumage. It\r\nhops everywhere over the lawns, just as our robin does, and it lives\r\nand nests in the gardens in the same fashion. Its song has a general\r\nresemblance to that of our robin, but many of the notes are far\r\nmore musical, more like those of our wood thrush. Indeed, there were\r\nindividuals among those we heard certain of whose notes seemed to me\r\nalmost to equal in point of melody the chimes of the wood thrush; and\r\nthe highest possible praise for any song-bird is to liken its song to\r\nthat of the wood thrush or hermit thrush. I certainly do not think that\r\nthe blackbird has received full justice in the books. I knew that he was\r\na singer, but I really had no idea how fine a singer he was. I suppose\r\none of his troubles has been his name, just as with our own catbird.\r\nWhen he appears in the ballads as the merle, bracketed with his cousin\r\nthe mavis, the song thrush, it is far easier to recognize him as the\r\nmaster singer that he is. It is a fine thing for England to have such\r\nan asset of the countryside, a bird so common, so much in evidence, so\r\nfearless, and such a really beautiful singer.\r\n\r\nThe thrush is a fine singer too, a better singer than our American\r\nrobin, but to my mind not at the best quite as good as the blackbird at\r\nhis best; although often I found difficulty in telling the song of one\r\nfrom the song of the other, especially if I only heard two or three\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\nThe larks were, of course, exceedingly attractive. It was fascinating\r\nto see them spring from the grass, circle upwards, steadily singing and\r\nsoaring for several minutes, and then return to the point whence\r\nthey had started. As my companion pointed out, they exactly fulfilled\r\nWordsworth's description; they soared but did not roam. It is quite\r\nimpossible wholly to differentiate a bird's voice from its habits and\r\nsurroundings. Although in the lark's song there are occasional musical\r\nnotes, the song as a whole is not very musical; but it is so joyous,\r\nbuoyant and unbroken, and uttered under such conditions as fully to\r\nentitle the bird to the place he occupies with both poet and prose\r\nwriter.\r\n\r\nThe most musical singer we heard was the blackcap warbler. To my ear\r\nits song seemed more musical than that of the nightingale. It was\r\nastonishingly powerful for so small a bird; in volume and continuity\r\nit does not come up to the songs of the thrushes and of certain other\r\nbirds, but in quality, as an isolated bit of melody, it can hardly be\r\nsurpassed.\r\n\r\nAmong the minor singers the robin was noticeable. We all know this\r\npretty little bird from the books, and I was prepared to find him as\r\nfriendly and attractive as he proved to be, but I had not realized how\r\nwell he sang. It is not a loud song, but very musical and attractive,\r\nand the bird is said to sing practically all through the year. The song\r\nof the wren interested me much, because it was not in the least like\r\nthat of our house wren, but, on the contrary, like that of our winter\r\nwren. The theme is the same as the winter wren's, but the song did not\r\nseem to me to be as brilliantly musical as that of the tiny singer of\r\nthe North Woods. The sedge warbler sang in the thick reeds a mocking\r\nventriloquial lay, which reminded me at times of the less pronounced\r\nparts of our yellow-breasted chat's song. The cuckoo's cry was\r\nsingularly attractive and musical, far more so than the rolling, many\r\ntimes repeated, note of our rain-crow.\r\n\r\nWe did not reach the inn at Brockenhurst until about nine o'clock, just\r\nat nightfall, and a few minutes before that we heard a nightjar. It did\r\nnot sound in the least like either our whip-poor-will or our night-hawk,\r\nuttering a long-continued call of one or two syllables, repeated over\r\nand over. The chaffinch was very much in evidence, continually chaunting\r\nits unimportant little ditty. I was pleased to see the bold, masterful\r\nmissel thrush, the stormcock as it is often called; but this bird breeds\r\nand sings in the early spring, when the weather is still tempestuous,\r\nand had long been silent when we saw it. The starlings, rooks, and\r\njackdaws did not sing, and their calls were attractive merely as the\r\ncalls of our grackles are attractive; and the other birds that we\r\nheard sing, though they played their part in the general chorus, were\r\nperformers of no especial note, like our tree-creepers, pine warblers,\r\nand chipping sparrows. The great spring chorus had already begun to\r\nsubside, but the woods and fields were still vocal with beautiful bird\r\nmusic, the country was very lovely, the inn as comfortable as possible,\r\nand the bath and supper very enjoyable after our tramp; and altogether I\r\npassed no pleasanter twenty-four hours during my entire European trip.\r\n\r\nTen days later, at Sagamore Hill, I was among my own birds, and was much\r\ninterested as I listened to and looked at them in remembering the notes\r\nand actions of the birds I had seen in England. On the evening of the\r\nfirst day I sat in my rocking-chair on the broad veranda, looking across\r\nthe Sound towards the glory of the sunset. The thickly grassed hillside\r\nsloped down in front of me to a belt of forest from which rose the\r\ngolden, leisurely chiming of the wood thrushes, chanting their vespers;\r\nthrough the still air came the warble of vireo and tanager; and after\r\nnightfall we heard the flight song of an ovenbird from the same belt\r\nof timber. Overhead an oriole sang in the weeping elm, now and then\r\nbreaking his song to scold like an overgrown wren. Song-sparrows and\r\ncatbirds sang in the shrubbery; one robin had built its nest over the\r\nfront and one over the back door, and there was a chippy's nest in the\r\nwistaria vine by the stoop. During the next twenty-four hours I saw and\r\nheard, either right around the house or while walking down to bathe,\r\nthrough the woods, the following forty-two birds:\r\n\r\nLittle green heron, night heron, red-tailed hawk, yellow-billed cuckoo,\r\nkingfisher, flicker, humming-bird, swift, meadow-lark, red-winged\r\nblackbird, sharp-tailed finch, song sparrow, chipping sparrow, bush\r\nsparrow, purple finch, Baltimore oriole, cowbunting, robin, wood thrush,\r\nthrasher, catbird, scarlet tanager, red-eyed vireo, yellow warbler,\r\nblack-throated green warbler, kingbird, wood peewee, crow, blue jay,\r\ncedar-bird, Maryland yellowthroat, chickadee, black and white\r\ncreeper, barn swallow, white-breasted swallow, ovenbird, thistlefinch,\r\nvesperfinch, indigo bunting, towhee, grasshopper-sparrow, and screech\r\nowl.\r\n\r\nThe birds were still in full song, for on Long Island there is little\r\nabatement in the chorus until about the second week of July, when\r\nthe blossoming of the chestnut trees patches the woodland with frothy\r\ngreenish-yellow.[*]\r\n\r\n     [*] Alas! the blight has now destroyed the chestnut trees,\r\n     and robbed our woods of one of their distinctive beauties.\r\n\r\nOur most beautiful singers are the wood thrushes; they sing not only in\r\nthe early morning but throughout the long hot June afternoons. Sometimes\r\nthey sing in the trees immediately around the house, and if the air is\r\nstill we can always hear them from among the tall trees at the foot of\r\nthe hill. The thrashers sing in the hedgerows beyond the garden, the\r\ncatbirds everywhere. The catbirds have such an attractive song that it\r\nis extremely irritating to know that at any moment they may interrupt\r\nit to mew and squeal. The bold, cheery music of the robins always seems\r\ntypical of the bold, cheery birds themselves. The Baltimore orioles nest\r\nin the young elms around the house, and the orchard orioles in the apple\r\ntrees near the garden and outbuildings. Among the earliest sounds of\r\nspring is the cheerful, simple, homely song of the song-sparrow; and in\r\nMarch we also hear the piercing cadence of the meadow-lark--to us one\r\nof the most attractive of all bird calls. Of late years now and then\r\nwe hear the rollicking, bubbling melody of the bobolink in the pastures\r\nback of the barn; and when the full chorus of these and of many other\r\nof the singers of spring is dying down, there are some true hot-weather\r\nsongsters, such as the brightly hued indigo buntings and thistlefinches.\r\nAmong the finches one of the most musical and plaintive songs is that of\r\nthe bush-sparrow--I do not know why the books call it field-sparrow,\r\nfor it does not dwell in the open fields like the vesperfinch, the\r\nsavannah-sparrow, and grasshopper-sparrow, but among the cedars and\r\nbayberry bushes and young locusts in the same places where the prairie\r\nwarbler is found. Nor is it only the true songs that delight us. We love\r\nto hear the flickers call, and we readily pardon any one of their number\r\nwhich, as occasionally happens, is bold enough to wake us in the\r\nearly morning by drumming on the shingles of the roof. In our ears the\r\nred-winged blackbirds have a very attractive note. We love the screaming\r\nof the red-tailed hawks as they soar high overhead, and even the calls\r\nof the night heron that nest in the tall water maples by one of the wood\r\nponds on our place, and the little green herons that nest beside the\r\nsalt marsh. It is hard to tell just how much of the attraction in any\r\nbird-note lies in the music itself and how much in the associations.\r\nThis is what makes it so useless to try to compare the bird songs of one\r\ncountry with those of another. A man who is worth anything can no more\r\nbe entirely impartial in speaking of the bird songs with which from\r\nhis earliest childhood he has been familiar than he can be entirely\r\nimpartial in speaking of his own family.\r\n\r\nAt Sagamore Hill we love a great many things--birds and trees and books,\r\nand all things beautiful, and horses and rifles and children and hard\r\nwork and the joy of life. We have great fireplaces, and in them the logs\r\nroar and crackle during the long winter evenings. The big piazza is for\r\nthe hot, still afternoons of summer. As in every house, there are things\r\nthat appeal to the householder because of their associations, but\r\nwhich would not mean much to others. Naturally, any man who has been\r\nPresident, and filled other positions, accumulates such things, with\r\nscant regard to his own personal merits. Perhaps our most cherished\r\npossessions are a Remington bronze, \"The Bronco Buster,\" given me by my\r\nmen when the regiment was mustered out, and a big Tiffany silver vase\r\ngiven to Mrs. Roosevelt by the enlisted men of the battleship Louisiana\r\nafter we returned from a cruise on her to Panama. It was a real surprise\r\ngift, presented to her in the White House, on behalf of the whole crew,\r\nby four as strapping man-of-war's-men as ever swung a turret or pointed\r\na twelve-inch gun. The enlisted men of the army I already knew well--of\r\ncourse I knew well the officers of both army and navy. But the enlisted\r\nmen of the navy I only grew to know well when I was President. On the\r\nLouisiana Mrs. Roosevelt and I once dined at the chief petty officers'\r\nmess, and on another battleship, the Missouri (when I was in company\r\nwith Admiral Evans and Captain Cowles), and again on the Sylph and on\r\nthe Mayflower, we also dined as guests of the crew. When we finished our\r\ntrip on the Louisiana I made a short speech to the assembled crew,\r\nand at its close one of the petty officers, the very picture of what a\r\nman-of-war's-man should look like, proposed three cheers for me in terms\r\nthat struck me as curiously illustrative of America at her best; he\r\nsaid, \"Now then, men, three cheers for Theodore Roosevelt, the typical\r\nAmerican citizen!\" That was the way in which they thought of the\r\nAmerican President--and a very good way, too. It was an expression that\r\nwould have come naturally only to men in whom the American principles of\r\ngovernment and life were ingrained, just as they were ingrained in the\r\nmen of my regiment. I need scarcely add, but I will add for the\r\nbenefit of those who do not know, that this attitude of self-respecting\r\nidentification of interest and purpose is not only compatible with but\r\ncan only exist when there is fine and real discipline, as thorough\r\nand genuine as the discipline that has always obtained in the most\r\nformidable fighting fleets and armies. The discipline and the mutual\r\nrespect are complementary, not antagonistic. During the Presidency all\r\nof us, but especially the children, became close friends with many of\r\nthe sailor men. The four bearers of the vase to Mrs. Roosevelt were\r\npromptly hailed as delightful big brothers by our two smallest boys, who\r\nat once took them to see the sights of Washington in the landau--\"the\r\nPresident's land-ho!\" as, with seafaring humor, our guests immediately\r\nstyled it. Once, after we were in private life again, Mrs. Roosevelt\r\nwas in a railway station and had some difficulty with her ticket. A\r\nfine-looking, quiet man stepped up and asked if he could be of help; he\r\nremarked that he had been one of the Mayflower's crew, and knew us well;\r\nand in answer to a question explained that he had left the navy in\r\norder to study dentistry, and added--a delicious touch--that while thus\r\npreparing himself to be a dentist he was earning the necessary money to\r\ngo on with his studies by practicing the profession of a prize-fighter,\r\nbeing a good man in the ring.\r\n\r\nThere are various bronzes in the house: Saint-Gaudens's \"Puritan,\" a\r\ntoken from my staff officers when I was Governor; Proctor's cougar, the\r\ngift of the Tennis Cabinet--who also gave us a beautiful silver bowl,\r\nwhich is always lovingly pronounced to rhyme with \"owl\" because that was\r\nthe pronunciation used at the time of the giving by the valued friend\r\nwho acted as spokesman for his fellow-members, and who was himself the\r\nonly non-American member of the said Cabinet. There is a horseman by\r\nMacmonnies, and a big bronze vase by Kemys, an adaptation or development\r\nof the pottery vases of the Southwestern Indians. Mixed with all of\r\nthese are gifts from varied sources, ranging from a brazen Buddha sent\r\nme by the Dalai Lama and a wonderful psalter from the Emperor Menelik to\r\na priceless ancient Samurai sword, coming from Japan in remembrance\r\nof the peace of Portsmouth, and a beautifully inlaid miniature suit of\r\nJapanese armor, given me by a favorite hero of mine, Admiral Togo, when\r\nhe visited Sagamore Hill. There are things from European friends; a\r\nmosaic picture of Pope Leo XIII in his garden; a huge, very handsome\r\nedition of the Nibelungenlied; a striking miniature of John Hampden from\r\nWindsor Castle; editions of Dante, and the campaigns of \"Eugenio von\r\nSavoy\" (another of my heroes, a dead hero this time); a Viking cup; the\r\nstate sword of a Uganda king; the gold box in which the \"freedom of the\r\ncity of London\" was given me; a beautiful head of Abraham Lincoln given\r\nme by the French authorities after my speech at the Sorbonne; and many\r\nother things from sources as diverse as the Sultan of Turkey and the\r\nDowager Empress of China. Then there are things from home friends: a\r\nPolar bear skin from Peary; a Sioux buffalo robe with, on it, painted\r\nby some long-dead Sioux artist, the picture story of Custer's fight; a\r\nbronze portrait plaque of Joel Chandler Harris; the candlestick used in\r\nsealing the Treaty of Portsmouth, sent me by Captain Cameron Winslow;\r\na shoe worn by Dan Patch when he paced a mile in 1:59, sent me by his\r\nowner. There is a picture of a bull moose by Carl Rungius, which seems\r\nto me as spirited an animal painting as I have ever seen. In the north\r\nroom, with its tables and mantelpiece and desks and chests made of woods\r\nsent from the Philippines by army friends, or by other friends for other\r\nreasons; with its bison and wapiti heads; there are three paintings by\r\nMarcus Symonds--\"Where Light and Shadow Meet,\" \"The Porcelain Towers,\"\r\nand \"The Seats of the Mighty\"; he is dead now, and he had scant\r\nrecognition while he lived, yet surely he was a great imaginative\r\nartist, a wonderful colorist, and a man with a vision more wonderful\r\nstill. There is one of Lungren's pictures of the Western plains; and a\r\npicture of the Grand Canyon; and one by a Scandinavian artist who could\r\nsee the fierce picturesqueness of workaday Pittsburgh; and sketches of\r\nthe White House by Sargent and by Hopkinson Smith.\r\n\r\nThe books are everywhere. There are as many in the north room and in the\r\nparlor--is drawing-room a more appropriate name than parlor?--as in the\r\nlibrary; the gun-room at the top of the house, which incidentally has\r\nthe loveliest view of all, contains more books than any of the other\r\nrooms; and they are particularly delightful books to browse among, just\r\nbecause they have not much relevance to one another, this being one of\r\nthe reasons why they are relegated to their present abode. But the books\r\nhave overflowed into all the other rooms too.\r\n\r\nI could not name any principle upon which the books have been gathered.\r\nBooks are almost as individual as friends. There is no earthly use in\r\nlaying down general laws about them. Some meet the needs of one person,\r\nand some of another; and each person should beware of the booklover's\r\nbesetting sin, of what Mr. Edgar Allan Poe calls \"the mad pride of\r\nintellectuality,\" taking the shape of arrogant pity for the man who does\r\nnot like the same kind of books. Of course there are books which a man\r\nor woman uses as instruments of a profession--law books, medical books,\r\ncookery books, and the like. I am not speaking of these, for they are\r\nnot properly \"books\" at all; they come in the category of time-tables,\r\ntelephone directories, and other useful agencies of civilized life. I\r\nam speaking of books that are meant to be read. Personally, granted that\r\nthese books are decent and healthy, the one test to which I demand\r\nthat they all submit is that of being interesting. If the book is not\r\ninteresting to the reader, then in all but an infinitesimal number of\r\ncases it gives scant benefit to the reader. Of course any reader ought\r\nto cultivate his or her taste so that good books will appeal to it, and\r\nthat trash won't. But after this point has once been reached, the needs\r\nof each reader must be met in a fashion that will appeal to those needs.\r\nPersonally the books by which I have profited infinitely more than\r\nby any others have been those in which profit was a by-product of the\r\npleasure; that is, I read them because I enjoyed them, because I liked\r\nreading them, and the profit came in as part of the enjoyment.\r\n\r\nOf course each individual is apt to have some special tastes in which\r\nhe cannot expect that any but a few friends will share. Now, I am very\r\nproud of my big-game library. I suppose there must be many big-game\r\nlibraries in Continental Europe, and possibly in England, more extensive\r\nthan mine, but I have not happened to come across any such library in\r\nthis country. Some of the originals go back to the sixteenth century,\r\nand there are copies or reproductions of the two or three most famous\r\nhunting books of the Middle Ages, such as the Duke of York's translation\r\nof Gaston Phoebus, and the queer book of the Emperor Maximilian. It is\r\nonly very occasionally that I meet any one who cares for any of these\r\nbooks. On the other hand, I expect to find many friends who will turn\r\nnaturally to some of the old or the new books of poetry or romance or\r\nhistory to which we of the household habitually turn. Let me add that\r\nours is in no sense a collector's library. Each book was procured\r\nbecause some one of the family wished to read it. We could never afford\r\nto take overmuch thought for the outsides of books; we were too much\r\ninterested in their insides.\r\n\r\nNow and then I am asked as to \"what books a statesman should read,\" and\r\nmy answer is, poetry and novels--including short stories under the\r\nhead of novels. I don't mean that he should read only novels and modern\r\npoetry. If he cannot also enjoy the Hebrew prophets and the Greek\r\ndramatists, he should be sorry. He ought to read interesting books on\r\nhistory and government, and books of science and philosophy; and really\r\ngood books on these subjects are as enthralling as any fiction ever\r\nwritten in prose or verse. Gibbon and Macaulay, Herodotus, Thucydides\r\nand Tacitus, the Heimskringla, Froissart, Joinville and Villehardouin,\r\nParkman and Mahan, Mommsen and Ranke--why! there are scores and scores\r\nof solid histories, the best in the world, which are as absorbing as\r\nthe best of all the novels, and of as permanent value. The same thing\r\nis true of Darwin and Huxley and Carlyle and Emerson, and parts of Kant,\r\nand of volumes like Sutherland's \"Growth of the Moral Instinct,\" or\r\nActon's Essays and Lounsbury's studies--here again I am not trying to\r\nclass books together, or measure one by another, or enumerate one in a\r\nthousand of those worth reading, but just to indicate that any man or\r\nwoman of some intelligence and some cultivation can in some line or\r\nother of serious thought, scientific or historical or philosophical or\r\neconomic or governmental, find any number of books which are charming to\r\nread, and which in addition give that for which his or her soul hungers.\r\nI do not for a minute mean that the statesman ought not to read a great\r\nmany different books of this character, just as every one else should\r\nread them. But, in the final event, the statesman, and the publicist,\r\nand the reformer, and the agitator for new things, and the upholder of\r\nwhat is good in old things, all need more than anything else to know\r\nhuman nature, to know the needs of the human soul; and they will find\r\nthis nature and these needs set forth as nowhere else by the great\r\nimaginative writers, whether of prose or of poetry.\r\n\r\nThe room for choice is so limitless that to my mind it seems absurd to\r\ntry to make catalogues which shall be supposed to appeal to all the best\r\nthinkers. This is why I have no sympathy whatever with writing lists of\r\nthe One Hundred Best Books, or the Five-Foot Library. It is all right\r\nfor a man to amuse himself by composing a list of a hundred very good\r\nbooks; and if he is to go off for a year or so where he cannot get\r\nmany books, it is an excellent thing to choose a five-foot library of\r\nparticular books which in that particular year and on that particular\r\ntrip he would like to read. But there is no such thing as a hundred\r\nbooks that are best for all men, or for the majority of men, or for\r\none man at all times; and there is no such thing as a five-foot library\r\nwhich will satisfy the needs of even one particular man on different\r\noccasions extending over a number of years. Milton is best for one mood\r\nand Pope for another. Because a man likes Whitman or Browning or Lowell\r\nhe should not feel himself debarred from Tennyson or Kipling or Korner\r\nor Heine or the Bard of the Dimbovitza. Tolstoy's novels are good at one\r\ntime and those of Sienkiewicz at another; and he is fortunate who can\r\nrelish \"Salammbo\" and \"Tom Brown\" and the \"Two Admirals\" and \"Quentin\r\nDurward\" and \"Artemus Ward\" and the \"Ingoldsby Legends\" and \"Pickwick\"\r\nand \"Vanity Fair.\" Why, there are hundreds of books like these, each one\r\nof which, if really read, really assimilated, by the person to whom\r\nit happens to appeal, will enable that person quite unconsciously to\r\nfurnish himself with much ammunition which he will find of use in the\r\nbattle of life.\r\n\r\nA book must be interesting to the particular reader at that particular\r\ntime. But there are tens of thousands of interesting books, and some of\r\nthem are sealed to some men and some are sealed to others; and some stir\r\nthe soul at some given point of a man's life and yet convey no message\r\nat other times. The reader, the booklover, must meet his own needs\r\nwithout paying too much attention to what his neighbors say those needs\r\nshould be. He must not hypocritically pretend to like what he does not\r\nlike. Yet at the same time he must avoid that most unpleasant of all\r\nthe indications of puffed-up vanity which consists in treating mere\r\nindividual, and perhaps unfortunate, idiosyncrasy as a matter of pride.\r\nI happen to be devoted to Macbeth, whereas I very seldom read Hamlet\r\n(though I like parts of it). Now I am humbly and sincerely conscious\r\nthat this is a demerit in me and not in Hamlet; and yet it would not do\r\nme any good to pretend that I like Hamlet as much as Macbeth when, as\r\na matter of fact, I don't. I am very fond of simple epics and of ballad\r\npoetry, from the Nibelungenlied and the Roland song through \"Chevy\r\nChase\" and \"Patrick Spens\" and \"Twa Corbies\" to Scott's poems and\r\nLongfellow's \"Saga of King Olaf\" and \"Othere.\" On the other hand, I\r\ndon't care to read dramas as a rule; I cannot read them with enjoyment\r\nunless they appeal to me very strongly. They must almost be AEschylus\r\nor Euripides, Goethe or Moliere, in order that I may not feel after\r\nfinishing them a sense of virtuous pride in having achieved a task. Now\r\nI would be the first to deny that even the most delightful old English\r\nballad should be put on a par with any one of scores of dramatic\r\nworks by authors whom I have not mentioned; I know that each of these\r\ndramatists has written what is of more worth than the ballad; only, I\r\nenjoy the ballad, and I don't enjoy the drama; and therefore the ballad\r\nis better for me, and this fact is not altered by the other fact that\r\nmy own shortcomings are to blame in the matter. I still read a number of\r\nScott's novels over and over again, whereas if I finish anything by Miss\r\nAusten I have a feeling that duty performed is a rainbow to the soul.\r\nBut other booklovers who are very close kin to me, and whose taste\r\nI know to be better than mine, read Miss Austen all the time--and,\r\nmoreover, they are very kind, and never pity me in too offensive a\r\nmanner for not reading her myself.\r\n\r\nAside from the masters of literature, there are all kinds of books which\r\none person will find delightful, and which he certainly ought not\r\nto surrender just because nobody else is able to find as much in the\r\nbeloved volume. There is on our book-shelves a little pre-Victorian\r\nnovel or tale called \"The Semi-Attached Couple.\" It is told with much\r\nhumor; it is a story of gentlefolk who are really gentlefolk; and to me\r\nit is altogether delightful. But outside the members of my own family\r\nI have never met a human being who had even heard of it, and I don't\r\nsuppose I ever shall meet one. I often enjoy a story by some living\r\nauthor so much that I write to tell him so--or to tell her so; and at\r\nleast half the time I regret my action, because it encourages the writer\r\nto believe that the public shares my views, and he then finds that the\r\npublic doesn't.\r\n\r\nBooks are all very well in their way, and we love them at Sagamore\r\nHill; but children are better than books. Sagamore Hill is one of three\r\nneighboring houses in which small cousins spent very happy years of\r\nchildhood. In the three houses there were at one time sixteen of these\r\nsmall cousins, all told, and once we ranged them in order of size and\r\ntook their photograph. There are many kinds of success in life worth\r\nhaving. It is exceedingly interesting and attractive to be a successful\r\nbusiness man, or railroad man, or farmer, or a successful lawyer or\r\ndoctor; or a writer, or a President, or a ranchman, or the colonel of\r\na fighting regiment, or to kill grizzly bears and lions. But for\r\nunflagging interest and enjoyment, a household of children, if things\r\ngo reasonably well, certainly makes all other forms of success and\r\nachievement lose their importance by comparison. It may be true that\r\nhe travels farthest who travels alone; but the goal thus reached is not\r\nworth reaching. And as for a life deliberately devoted to pleasure as\r\nan end--why, the greatest happiness is the happiness that comes as a\r\nby-product of striving to do what must be done, even though sorrow is\r\nmet in the doing. There is a bit of homely philosophy, quoted by Squire\r\nBill Widener, of Widener's Valley, Virginia, which sums up one's duty in\r\nlife: \"Do what you can, with what you've got, where you are.\"\r\n\r\nThe country is the place for children, and if not the country, a city\r\nsmall enough so that one can get out into the country. When our own\r\nchildren were little, we were for several winters in Washington, and\r\neach Sunday afternoon the whole family spent in Rock Creek Park, which\r\nwas then very real country indeed. I would drag one of the children's\r\nwagons; and when the very smallest pairs of feet grew tired of trudging\r\nbravely after us, or of racing on rapturous side trips after flowers and\r\nother treasures, the owners would clamber into the wagon. One of these\r\nwagons, by the way, a gorgeous red one, had \"Express\" painted on it in\r\ngilt letters, and was known to the younger children as the \"'spress\"\r\nwagon. They evidently associated the color with the term. Once while we\r\nwere at Sagamore something happened to the cherished \"'spress\" wagon to\r\nthe distress of the children, and especially of the child who owned it.\r\nTheir mother and I were just starting for a drive in the buggy, and we\r\npromised the bereaved owner that we would visit a store we knew in East\r\nNorwich, a village a few miles away, and bring back another \"'spress\"\r\nwagon. When we reached the store, we found to our dismay that the wagon\r\nwhich we had seen had been sold. We could not bear to return without\r\nthe promised gift, for we knew that the brains of small persons are much\r\npuzzled when their elders seem to break promises. Fortunately, we saw in\r\nthe store a delightful little bright-red chair and bright-red table,\r\nand these we brought home and handed solemnly over to the expectant\r\nrecipient, explaining that as there unfortunately was not a \"'spress\"\r\nwagon we had brought him back a \"'spress\" chair and \"'spress\" table.\r\nIt worked beautifully! The \"'spress\" chair and table were received with\r\nsuch rapture that we had to get duplicates for the other small member\r\nof the family who was the particular crony of the proprietor of the new\r\ntreasures.\r\n\r\nWhen their mother and I returned from a row, we would often see the\r\nchildren waiting for us, running like sand-spiders along the beach. They\r\nalways liked to swim in company with a grown-up of buoyant temperament\r\nand inventive mind, and the float offered limitless opportunities\r\nfor enjoyment while bathing. All dutiful parents know the game of\r\n\"stage-coach\"; each child is given a name, such as the whip, the nigh\r\nleader, the off wheeler, the old lady passenger, and, under penalty of\r\npaying a forfeit, must get up and turn round when the grown-up, who is\r\nimprovising a thrilling story, mentions that particular object; and when\r\nthe word \"stage-coach\" is mentioned, everybody has to get up and turn\r\nround. Well, we used to play stage-coach on the float while in swimming,\r\nand instead of tamely getting up and turning round, the child whose\r\nturn it was had to plunge overboard. When I mentioned \"stage-coach,\" the\r\nwater fairly foamed with vigorously kicking little legs; and then there\r\nwas always a moment of interest while I counted, so as to be sure\r\nthat the number of heads that came up corresponded with the number of\r\nchildren who had gone down.\r\n\r\nNo man or woman will ever forget the time when some child lies sick of a\r\ndisease that threatens its life. Moreover, much less serious sickness is\r\nunpleasant enough at the time. Looking back, however, there are elements\r\nof comedy in certain of the less serious cases. I well remember one such\r\ninstance which occurred when we were living in Washington, in a small\r\nhouse, with barely enough room for everybody when all the chinks were\r\nfilled. Measles descended on the household. In the effort to keep the\r\nchildren that were well and those that were sick apart, their mother and\r\nI had to camp out in improvised fashion. When the eldest small boy was\r\ngetting well, and had recovered his spirits, I slept on a sofa beside\r\nhis bed--the sofa being so short that my feet projected over anyhow. One\r\nafternoon the small boy was given a toy organ by a sympathetic friend.\r\nNext morning early I was waked to find the small boy very vivacious\r\nand requesting a story. Having drowsily told the story, I said, \"Now,\r\nfather's told you a story, so you amuse yourself and let father go to\r\nsleep\"; to which the small boy responded most virtuously, \"Yes, father\r\nwill go to sleep and I'll play the organ,\" which he did, at a distance\r\nof two feet from my head. Later his sister, who had just come down with\r\nthe measles, was put into the same room. The small boy was convalescing,\r\nand was engaged in playing on the floor with some tin ships, together\r\nwith two or three pasteboard monitors and rams of my own manufacture. He\r\nwas giving a vivid rendering of Farragut at Mobile Bay, from memories\r\nof how I had told the story. My pasteboard rams and monitors were\r\nfascinating--if a naval architect may be allowed to praise his own\r\nwork--and as property they were equally divided between the little girl\r\nand the small boy. The little girl looked on with alert suspicion from\r\nthe bed, for she was not yet convalescent enough to be allowed down on\r\nthe floor. The small boy was busily reciting the phases of the fight,\r\nwhich now approached its climax, and the little girl evidently suspected\r\nthat her monitor was destined to play the part of victim.\r\n\r\nLittle boy. \"And then they steamed bang into the monitor.\"\r\n\r\nLittle girl. \"Brother, don't you sink my monitor!\"\r\n\r\nLittle boy (without heeding, and hurrying toward the climax). \"And the\r\ntorpedo went at the monitor!\"\r\n\r\nLittle girl. \"My monitor is not to sink!\"\r\n\r\nLittle boy, dramatically: \"And bang the monitor sank!\"\r\n\r\nLittle girl. \"It didn't do any such thing. My monitor always goes to bed\r\nat seven, and it's now quarter past. My monitor was in bed and couldn't\r\nsink!\"\r\n\r\nWhen I was Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Leonard Wood and I used\r\noften to combine forces and take both families of children out to walk,\r\nand occasionally some of their playmates. Leonard Wood's son, I found,\r\nattributed the paternity of all of those not of his own family to me.\r\nOnce we were taking the children across Rock Creek on a fallen tree.\r\nI was standing on the middle of the log trying to prevent any of the\r\nchildren from falling off, and while making a clutch at one peculiarly\r\nactive and heedless child I fell off myself. As I emerged from the water\r\nI heard the little Wood boy calling frantically to the General: \"Oh! oh!\r\nThe father of all the children fell into the creek!\"--which made me feel\r\nlike an uncommonly moist patriarch. Of course the children took much\r\ninterest in the trophies I occasionally brought back from my hunts. When\r\nI started for my regiment, in '98, the stress of leaving home, which\r\nwas naturally not pleasant, was somewhat lightened by the next to\r\nthe youngest boy, whose ideas of what was about to happen were hazy,\r\nclasping me round the legs with a beaming smile and saying, \"And is my\r\nfather going to the war? And will he bring me back a bear?\" When, some\r\nfive months later, I returned, of course in my uniform, this little boy\r\nwas much puzzled as to my identity, although he greeted me affably\r\nwith \"Good afternoon, Colonel.\" Half an hour later somebody asked him,\r\n\"Where's father?\" to which he responded, \"I don't know; but the Colonel\r\nis taking a bath.\"\r\n\r\nOf course the children anthropomorphized--if that is the proper\r\nterm--their friends of the animal world. Among these friends at one\r\nperiod was the baker's horse, and on a very rainy day I heard the little\r\ngirl, who was looking out of the window, say, with a melancholy shake of\r\nher head, \"Oh! there's poor Kraft's horse, all soppin' wet!\"\r\n\r\nWhile I was in the White House the youngest boy became an _habitue_ of\r\na small and rather noisome animal shop, and the good-natured owner would\r\noccasionally let him take pets home to play with. On one occasion I was\r\nholding a conversation with one of the leaders in Congress, Uncle\r\nPete Hepburn, about the Railroad Rate Bill. The children were strictly\r\ntrained not to interrupt business, but on this particular occasion the\r\nlittle boy's feelings overcame him. He had been loaned a king-snake,\r\nwhich, as all nature-lovers know, is not only a useful but a beautiful\r\nsnake, very friendly to human beings; and he came rushing home to show\r\nthe treasure. He was holding it inside his coat, and it contrived to\r\nwiggle partly down the sleeve. Uncle Pete Hepburn naturally did not\r\nunderstand the full import of what the little boy was saying to me as\r\nhe endeavored to wriggle out of his jacket, and kindly started to help\r\nhim--and then jumped back with alacrity as the small boy and the snake\r\nboth popped out of the jacket.\r\n\r\nThere could be no healthier and pleasanter place in which to bring up\r\nchildren than in that nook of old-time America around Sagamore Hill.\r\nCertainly I never knew small people to have a better time or a better\r\ntraining for their work in after life than the three families of cousins\r\nat Sagamore Hill. It was real country, and--speaking from the somewhat\r\ndetached point of view of the masculine parent--I should say there was\r\njust the proper mixture of freedom and control in the management of the\r\nchildren. They were never allowed to be disobedient or to shirk lessons\r\nor work; and they were encouraged to have all the fun possible. They\r\noften went barefoot, especially during the many hours passed in various\r\nenthralling pursuits along and in the waters of the bay. They swam,\r\nthey tramped, they boated, they coasted and skated in winter, they were\r\nintimate friends with the cows, chickens, pigs, and other live stock.\r\nThey had in succession two ponies, General Grant and, when the General's\r\nlegs became such that he lay down too often and too unexpectedly in\r\nthe road, a calico pony named Algonquin, who is still living a life of\r\nhonorable leisure in the stable and in the pasture--where he has to be\r\npicketed, because otherwise he chases the cows. Sedate pony Grant used\r\nto draw the cart in which the children went driving when they were very\r\nsmall, the driver being their old nurse Mame, who had held their mother\r\nin her arms when she was born, and who was knit to them by a tie as\r\nclose as any tie of blood. I doubt whether I ever saw Mame really\r\noffended with them except once when, out of pure but misunderstood\r\naffection, they named a pig after her. They loved pony Grant. Once I\r\nsaw the then little boy of three hugging pony Grant's fore legs. As\r\nhe leaned over, his broad straw hat tilted on end, and pony Grant\r\nmeditatively munched the brim; whereupon the small boy looked up with\r\na wail of anguish, evidently thinking the pony had decided to treat him\r\nlike a radish.\r\n\r\nThe children had pets of their own, too, of course. Among them guinea\r\npigs were the stand-bys--their highly unemotional nature fits them\r\nfor companionship with adoring but over-enthusiastic young masters and\r\nmistresses. Then there were flying squirrels, and kangaroo rats, gentle\r\nand trustful, and a badger whose temper was short but whose nature was\r\nfundamentally friendly. The badger's name was Josiah; the particular\r\nlittle boy whose property he was used to carry him about, clasped firmly\r\naround what would have been his waist if he had had any. Inasmuch as\r\nwhen on the ground the badger would play energetic games of tag with\r\nthe little boy and nip his bare legs, I suggested that it would be\r\nuncommonly disagreeable if he took advantage of being held in the little\r\nboy's arms to bite his face; but this suggestion was repelled with\r\nscorn as an unworthy assault on the character of Josiah. \"He bites legs\r\nsometimes, but he never bites faces,\" said the little boy. We also had\r\na young black bear whom the children christened Jonathan Edwards, partly\r\nout of compliment to their mother, who was descended from that great\r\nPuritan divine, and partly because the bear possessed a temper in\r\nwhich gloom and strength were combined in what the children regarded as\r\nCalvinistic proportions. As for the dogs, of course there were many,\r\nand during their lives they were intimate and valued family friends,\r\nand their deaths were household tragedies. One of them, a large yellow\r\nanimal of several good breeds and valuable rather because of psychical\r\nthan physical traits, was named \"Susan\" by his small owners, in\r\ncommemoration of another retainer, a white cow; the fact that the cow\r\nand the dog were not of the same sex being treated with indifference.\r\nMuch the most individual of the dogs and the one with the strongest\r\ncharacter was Sailor Boy, a Chesapeake Bay dog. He had a masterful\r\ntemper and a strong sense of both dignity and duty. He would never let\r\nthe other dogs fight, and he himself never fought unless circumstances\r\nimperatively demanded it; but he was a murderous animal when he did\r\nfight. He was not only exceedingly fond of the water, as was to be\r\nexpected, but passionately devoted to gunpowder in every form, for\r\nhe loved firearms and fairly reveled in the Fourth of July\r\ncelebrations--the latter being rather hazardous occasions, as the\r\nchildren strongly objected to any \"safe and sane\" element being injected\r\ninto them, and had the normal number of close shaves with rockets, Roman\r\ncandles, and firecrackers.\r\n\r\nOne of the stand-bys for enjoyment, especially in rainy weather, was the\r\nold barn. This had been built nearly a century previously, and was as\r\ndelightful as only the pleasantest kind of old barn can be. It stood\r\nat the meeting-spot of three fences. A favorite amusement used to be an\r\nobstacle race when the barn was full of hay. The contestants were timed\r\nand were started successively from outside the door. They rushed inside,\r\nclambered over or burrowed through the hay, as suited them best, dropped\r\nout of a place where a loose board had come off, got over, through, or\r\nunder the three fences, and raced back to the starting-point. When they\r\nwere little, their respective fathers were expected also to take part\r\nin the obstacle race, and when with the advance of years the fathers\r\nfinally refused to be contestants, there was a general feeling of pained\r\nregret among the children at such a decline in the sporting spirit.\r\n\r\nAnother famous place for handicap races was Cooper's Bluff, a gigantic\r\nsand-bank rising from the edge of the bay, a mile from the house. If\r\nthe tide was high there was an added thrill, for some of the contestants\r\nwere sure to run into the water.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the little boys learned to swim they were allowed to go off\r\nby themselves in rowboats and camp out for the night along the Sound.\r\nSometimes I would go along so as to take the smaller children. Once\r\na schooner was wrecked on a point half a dozen miles away. She\r\nheld together well for a season or two after having been cleared of\r\neverything down to the timbers, and this gave us the chance to make\r\ncamping-out trips in which the girls could also be included, for we put\r\nthem to sleep in the wreck, while the boys slept on the shore; squaw\r\npicnics, the children called them.\r\n\r\nMy children, when young, went to the public school near us, the little\r\nCove School, as it is called. For nearly thirty years we have given\r\nthe Christmas tree to the school. Before the gifts are distributed I am\r\nexpected to make an address, which is always mercifully short, my own\r\nchildren having impressed upon me with frank sincerity the attitude of\r\nother children to addresses of this kind on such occasions. There are of\r\ncourse performances by the children themselves, while all of us parents\r\nlook admiringly on, each sympathizing with his or her particular\r\noffspring in the somewhat wooden recital of \"Darius Green and his Flying\r\nMachine\" or \"The Mountain and the Squirrel had a Quarrel.\" But the tree\r\nand the gifts make up for all shortcomings.\r\n\r\nWe had a sleigh for winter; but if, when there was much snow, the whole\r\nfamily desired to go somewhere, we would put the body of the farm wagon\r\non runners and all bundle in together. We always liked snow at Christmas\r\ntime, and the sleigh-ride down to the church on Christmas eve. One\r\nof the hymns always sung at this Christmas eve festival begins, \"It's\r\nChristmas eve on the river, it's Christmas eve on the bay.\" All good\r\nnatives of the village firmly believe that this hymn was written here,\r\nand with direct reference to Oyster Bay; although if such were the case\r\nthe word \"river\" would have to be taken in a hyperbolic sense, as the\r\nnearest approach to a river is the village pond. I used to share this\r\nbelief myself, until my faith was shaken by a Denver lady who wrote that\r\nshe had sung that hymn when a child in Michigan, and that at the present\r\ntime her little Denver babies also loved it, although in their case the\r\nriver was not represented by even a village pond.\r\n\r\nWhen we were in Washington, the children usually went with their mother\r\nto the Episcopal church, while I went to the Dutch Reformed. But if any\r\nchild misbehaved itself, it was sometimes sent next Sunday to church\r\nwith me, on the theory that my companionship would have a sedative\r\neffect--which it did, as I and the child walked along with rather\r\nconstrained politeness, each eying the other with watchful readiness\r\nfor the unexpected. On one occasion, when the child's conduct fell just\r\nshort of warranting such extreme measures, his mother, as they were on\r\nthe point of entering church, concluded a homily by a quotation\r\nwhich showed a certain haziness of memory concerning the marriage and\r\nbaptismal services: \"No, little boy, if this conduct continues, I shall\r\nthink that you neither love, honor, nor obey me!\" However, the culprit\r\nwas much impressed with a sense of shortcoming as to the obligations he\r\nhad undertaken; so the result was as satisfactory as if the quotation\r\nhad been from the right service.\r\n\r\nAs for the education of the children, there was of course much of it\r\nthat represented downright hard work and drudgery. There was also\r\nmuch training that came as a by-product and was perhaps almost as\r\nvaluable--not as a substitute but as an addition. After their supper,\r\nthe children, when little, would come trotting up to their mother's\r\nroom to be read to, and it was always a surprise to me to notice the\r\nextremely varied reading which interested them, from Howard Pyle's\r\n\"Robin Hood,\" Mary Alicia Owen's \"Voodoo Tales,\" and Joel Chandler\r\nHarris's \"Aaron in the Wild Woods,\" to \"Lycides\" and \"King John.\" If\r\ntheir mother was absent, I would try to act as vice-mother--a poor\r\nsubstitute, I fear--superintending the supper and reading aloud\r\nafterwards. The children did not wish me to read the books they desired\r\ntheir mother to read, and I usually took some such book as \"Hereward the\r\nWake,\" or \"Guy Mannering,\" or \"The Last of the Mohicans\" or else some\r\nstory about a man-eating tiger, or a man-eating lion, from one of the\r\nhunting books in my library. These latter stories were always favorites,\r\nand as the authors told them in the first person, my interested auditors\r\ngrew to know them by the name of the \"I\" stories, and regarded them as\r\nadventures all of which happened to the same individual. When Selous,\r\nthe African hunter, visited us, I had to get him to tell to the younger\r\nchildren two or three of the stories with which they were already\r\nfamiliar from my reading; and as Selous is a most graphic narrator, and\r\nalways enters thoroughly into the feeling not only of himself but of\r\nthe opposing lion or buffalo, my own rendering of the incidents was cast\r\nentirely into the shade.\r\n\r\nBesides profiting by the more canonical books on education, we profited\r\nby certain essays and articles of a less orthodox type. I wish to\r\nexpress my warmest gratitude for such books--not of avowedly didactic\r\npurpose--as Laura Richards's books, Josephine Dodge Daskam's \"Madness of\r\nPhilip,\" Palmer Cox's \"Queer People,\" the melodies of Father Goose and\r\nMother Wild Goose, Flandreau's \"Mrs. White's,\" Myra Kelly's stories of\r\nher little East Side pupils, and Michelson's \"Madigans.\" It is well to\r\ntake duties, and life generally, seriously. It is also well to remember\r\nthat a sense of humor is a healthy anti-scorbutic to that portentous\r\nseriousness which defeats its own purpose.\r\n\r\nOccasionally bits of self-education proved of unexpected help to the\r\nchildren in later years. Like other children, they were apt to take to\r\nbed with them treasures which they particularly esteemed. One of the\r\nboys, just before his sixteenth birthday, went moose hunting with the\r\nfamily doctor, and close personal friend of the entire family, Alexander\r\nLambert. Once night overtook them before they camped, and they had to\r\nlie down just where they were. Next morning Dr. Lambert rather enviously\r\ncongratulated the boy on the fact that stones and roots evidently\r\ndid not interfere with the soundness of his sleep; to which the boy\r\nresponded, \"Well, Doctor, you see it isn't very long since I used to\r\ntake fourteen china animals to bed with me every night!\"\r\n\r\nAs the children grew up, Sagamore Hill remained delightful for them.\r\nThere were picnics and riding parties, there were dances in the north\r\nroom--sometimes fancy dress dances--and open-air plays on the green\r\ntennis court of one of the cousin's houses. The children are no longer\r\nchildren now. Most of them are men and women, working out their own\r\nfates in the big world; some in our own land, others across the great\r\noceans or where the Southern Cross blazes in the tropic nights. Some of\r\nthem have children of their own; some are working at one thing, some at\r\nanother; in cable ships, in business offices, in factories, in newspaper\r\noffices, building steel bridges, bossing gravel trains and steam\r\nshovels, or laying tracks and superintending freight traffic. They have\r\nhad their share of accidents and escapes; as I write, word comes from\r\na far-off land that one of them, whom Seth Bullock used to call \"Kim\"\r\nbecause he was the friend of all mankind, while bossing a dangerous\r\nbut necessary steel structural job has had two ribs and two back teeth\r\nbroken, and is back at work. They have known and they will know joy and\r\nsorrow, triumph and temporary defeat. But I believe they are all the\r\nbetter off because of their happy and healthy childhood.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to win the great prizes of life without running risks,\r\nand the greatest of all prizes are those connected with the home. No\r\nfather and mother can hope to escape sorrow and anxiety, and there are\r\ndreadful moments when death comes very near those we love, even if for\r\nthe time being it passes by. But life is a great adventure, and the\r\nworst of all fears is the fear of living. There are many forms of\r\nsuccess, many forms of triumph. But there is no other success that in\r\nany shape or way approaches that which is open to most of the many, many\r\nmen and women who have the right ideals. These are the men and the women\r\nwho see that it is the intimate and homely things that count most. They\r\nare the men and women who have the courage to strive for the happiness\r\nwhich comes only with labor and effort and self-sacrifice, and only to\r\nthose whose joy in life springs in part from power of work and sense of\r\nduty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENCY; MAKING AN OLD PARTY PROGRESSIVE\r\n\r\nOn September 6, 1901, President McKinley was shot by an Anarchist in the\r\ncity of Buffalo. I went to Buffalo at once. The President's condition\r\nseemed to be improving, and after a day or two we were told that he\r\nwas practically out of danger. I then joined my family, who were in the\r\nAdirondacks, near the foot of Mount Tahawus. A day or two afterwards\r\nwe took a long tramp through the forest, and in the afternoon I climbed\r\nMount Tahawus. After reaching the top I had descended a few hundred feet\r\nto a shelf of land where there was a little lake, when I saw a guide\r\ncoming out of the woods on our trail from below. I felt at once that he\r\nhad bad news, and, sure enough, he handed me a telegram saying that the\r\nPresident's condition was much worse and that I must come to Buffalo\r\nimmediately. It was late in the afternoon, and darkness had fallen by\r\nthe time I reached the clubhouse where we were staying. It was some time\r\nafterwards before I could get a wagon to drive me out to the nearest\r\nrailway station, North Creek, some forty or fifty miles distant. The\r\nroads were the ordinary wilderness roads and the night was dark. But we\r\nchanged horses two or three times--when I say \"we\" I mean the driver\r\nand I, as there was no one else with us--and reached the station just at\r\ndawn, to learn from Mr. Loeb, who had a special train waiting, that the\r\nPresident was dead. That evening I took the oath of office, in the house\r\nof Ansley Wilcox, at Buffalo.\r\n\r\nOn three previous occasions the Vice-President had succeeded to the\r\nPresidency on the death of the President. In each case there had been\r\na reversal of party policy, and a nearly immediate and nearly complete\r\nchange in the personnel of the higher offices, especially the Cabinet.\r\nI had never felt that this was wise from any standpoint. If a man is fit\r\nto be President, he will speedily so impress himself in the office that\r\nthe policies pursued will be his anyhow, and he will not have to bother\r\nas to whether he is changing them or not; while as regards the offices\r\nunder him, the important thing for him is that his subordinates shall\r\nmake a success in handling their several departments. The subordinate is\r\nsure to desire to make a success of his department for his own sake, and\r\nif he is a fit man, whose views on public policy are sound, and whose\r\nabilities entitle him to his position, he will do excellently under\r\nalmost any chief with the same purposes.\r\n\r\nI at once announced that I would continue unchanged McKinley's policies\r\nfor the honor and prosperity of the country, and I asked all the members\r\nof the Cabinet to stay. There were no changes made among them save as\r\nchanges were made among their successors whom I myself appointed. I\r\ncontinued Mr. McKinley's policies, changing and developing them and\r\nadding new policies only as the questions before the public changed and\r\nas the needs of the public developed. Some of my friends shook their\r\nheads over this, telling me that the men I retained would not be \"loyal\r\nto me,\" and that I would seem as if I were \"a pale copy of McKinley.\"\r\nI told them that I was not nervous on this score, and that if the men\r\nI retained were loyal to their work they would be giving me the loyalty\r\nfor which I most cared; and that if they were not, I would change them\r\nanyhow; and that as for being \"a pale copy of McKinley,\" I was not\r\nprimarily concerned with either following or not following in his\r\nfootsteps, but in facing the new problems that arose; and that if I were\r\ncompetent I would find ample opportunity to show my competence by my\r\ndeeds without worrying myself as to how to convince people of the fact.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons I have already given in my chapter on the Governorship\r\nof New York, the Republican party, which in the days of Abraham Lincoln\r\nwas founded as the radical progressive party of the Nation, had been\r\nobliged during the last decade of the nineteenth century to uphold\r\nthe interests of popular government against a foolish and illjudged\r\nmock-radicalism. It remained the Nationalist as against the\r\nparticularist or State's rights party, and in so far it remained\r\nabsolutely sound; for little permanent good can be done by any party\r\nwhich worships the State's rights fetish or which fails to regard the\r\nState, like the county or the municipality, as merely a convenient unit\r\nfor local self-government, while in all National matters, of importance\r\nto the whole people, the Nation is to be supreme over State, county, and\r\ntown alike. But the State's rights fetish, although still effectively\r\nused at certain times by both courts and Congress to block needed\r\nNational legislation directed against the huge corporations or in the\r\ninterests of workingmen, was not a prime issue at the time of which I\r\nspeak. In 1896, 1898, and 1900 the campaigns were waged on two great\r\nmoral issues: (1) the imperative need of a sound and honest currency;\r\n(2) the need, after 1898, of meeting in manful and straightforward\r\nfashion the extraterritorial problems arising from the Spanish War. On\r\nthese great moral issues the Republican party was right, and the men who\r\nwere opposed to it, and who claimed to be the radicals, and their allies\r\namong the sentimentalists, were utterly and hopelessly wrong. This had,\r\nregrettably but perhaps inevitably, tended to throw the party into the\r\nhands not merely of the conservatives but of the reactionaries; of men\r\nwho, sometimes for personal and improper reasons, but more often with\r\nentire sincerity and uprightness of purpose, distrusted anything that\r\nwas progressive and dreaded radicalism. These men still from force of\r\nhabit applauded what Lincoln had done in the way of radical dealing\r\nwith the abuses of his day; but they did not apply the spirit in which\r\nLincoln worked to the abuses of their own day. Both houses of Congress\r\nwere controlled by these men. Their leaders in the Senate were Messrs.\r\nAldrich and Hale. The Speaker of the House when I became President\r\nwas Mr. Henderson, but in a little over a year he was succeeded by Mr.\r\nCannon, who, although widely differing from Senator Aldrich in matters\r\nof detail, represented the same type of public sentiment. There were\r\nmany points on which I agreed with Mr. Cannon and Mr. Aldrich, and some\r\npoints on which I agreed with Mr. Hale. I made a resolute effort to get\r\non with all three and with their followers, and I have no question that\r\nthey made an equally resolute effort to get on with me. We succeeded in\r\nworking together, although with increasing friction, for some years, I\r\npushing forward and they hanging back. Gradually, however, I was forced\r\nto abandon the effort to persuade them to come my way, and then I\r\nachieved results only by appealing over the heads of the Senate and\r\nHouse leaders to the people, who were the masters of both of us. I\r\ncontinued in this way to get results until almost the close of my term;\r\nand the Republican party became once more the progressive and indeed the\r\nfairly radical progressive party of the Nation. When my successor was\r\nchosen, however, the leaders of the House and Senate, or most of them,\r\nfelt that it was safe to come to a break with me, and the last or short\r\nsession of Congress, held between the election of my successor and his\r\ninauguration four months later, saw a series of contests\r\nbetween the majorities in the two houses of Congress and the\r\nPresident,--myself,--quite as bitter as if they and I had belonged to\r\nopposite political parties. However, I held my own. I was not able to\r\npush through the legislation I desired during these four months, but\r\nI was able to prevent them doing anything I did not desire, or undoing\r\nanything that I had already succeeded in getting done.\r\n\r\nThere were, of course, many Senators and members of the lower house with\r\nwhom up to the very last I continued to work in hearty accord, and with\r\na growing understanding. I have not the space to enumerate, as I would\r\nlike to, these men. For many years Senator Lodge had been my close\r\npersonal and political friend, with whom I discussed all public\r\nquestions that arose, usually with agreement; and our intimately close\r\nrelations were of course unchanged by my entry into the White House. He\r\nwas of all our public men the man who had made the closest and wisest\r\nstudy of our foreign relations, and more clearly than almost any\r\nother man he understood the vital fact that the efficiency of our\r\nnavy conditioned our national efficiency in foreign affairs. Anything\r\nrelating to our international relations, from Panama and the navy to the\r\nAlaskan boundary question, the Algeciras negotiations, or the peace of\r\nPortsmouth, I was certain to discuss with Senator Lodge and also with\r\ncertain other members of Congress, such as Senator Turner of Washington\r\nand Representative Hitt of Illinois. Anything relating to labor\r\nlegislation and to measures for controlling big business or efficiently\r\nregulating the giant railway systems, I was certain to discuss with\r\nSenator Dolliver or Congressman Hepburn or Congressman Cooper. With\r\nmen like Senator Beveridge, Congressman (afterwards Senator) Dixon,\r\nand Congressman Murdock, I was apt to discuss pretty nearly everything\r\nrelating to either our internal or our external affairs. There were\r\nmany, many others. The present president of the Senate, Senator Clark,\r\nof Arkansas, was as fearless and high-minded a representative of the\r\npeople of the United States as I ever dealt with. He was one of the men\r\nwho combined loyalty to his own State with an equally keen loyalty to\r\nthe people of all the United States. He was politically opposed to me;\r\nbut when the interests of the country were at stake, he was incapable of\r\nconsidering party differences; and this was especially his attitude\r\nin international matters--including certain treaties which most of\r\nhis party colleagues, with narrow lack of patriotism, and complete\r\nsubordination of National to factional interest, opposed. I have never\r\nanywhere met finer, more faithful, more disinterested, and more\r\nloyal public servants than Senator O. H. Platt, a Republican, from\r\nConnecticut, and Senator Cockrell, a Democrat, from Missouri. They were\r\nalready old men when I came to the Presidency; and doubtless there\r\nwere points on which I seemed to them to be extreme and radical; but\r\neventually they found that our motives and beliefs were the same,\r\nand they did all in their power to help any movement that was for the\r\ninterest of our people as a whole. I had met them when I was Civil\r\nService Commissioner and Assistant Secretary of the Navy. All I ever had\r\nto do with either was to convince him that a given measure I championed\r\nwas right, and he then at once did all he could to have it put into\r\neffect. If I could not convince them, why! that was my fault, or my\r\nmisfortune; but if I could convince them, I never had to think again as\r\nto whether they would or would not support me. There were many other men\r\nof mark in both houses with whom I could work on some points, whereas\r\non others we had to differ. There was one powerful leader--a burly,\r\nforceful man, of admirable traits--who had, however, been trained in\r\nthe post-bellum school of business and politics, so that his attitude\r\ntowards life, quite unconsciously, reminded me a little of Artemus\r\nWard's view of the Tower of London--\"If I like it, I'll buy it.\" There\r\nwas a big governmental job in which this leader was much interested,\r\nand in reference to which he always wished me to consult a man whom\r\nhe trusted, whom I will call Pitt Rodney. One day I answered him, \"The\r\ntrouble with Rodney is that he misestimates his relations to cosmos\";\r\nto which he responded, \"Cosmos--Cosmos? Never heard of him. You stick\r\nto Rodney. He's your man!\" Outside of the public servants there were\r\nmultitudes of men, in newspaper offices, in magazine offices, in\r\nbusiness or the professions or on farms or in shops, who actively\r\nsupported the policies for which I stood and did work of genuine\r\nleadership which was quite as effective as any work done by men in\r\npublic office. Without the active support of these men I would have\r\nbeen powerless. In particular, the leading newspaper correspondents\r\nat Washington were as a whole a singularly able, trustworthy, and\r\npublic-spirited body of men, and the most useful of all agents in the\r\nfight for efficient and decent government.\r\n\r\nAs for the men under me in executive office, I could not overstate the\r\ndebt of gratitude I owe them. From the heads of the departments, the\r\nCabinet officers, down, the most striking feature of the Administration\r\nwas the devoted, zealous, and efficient work that was done as soon as it\r\nbecame understood that the one bond of interest among all of us was the\r\ndesire to make the Government the most effective instrument in advancing\r\nthe interests of the people as a whole, the interests of the average men\r\nand women of the United States and of their children. I do not think I\r\noverstate the case when I say that most of the men who did the best work\r\nunder me felt that ours was a partnership, that we all stood on the same\r\nlevel of purpose and service, and that it mattered not what position any\r\none of us held so long as in that position he gave the very best that\r\nwas in him. We worked very hard; but I made a point of getting a couple\r\nof hours off each day for equally vigorous play. The men with whom I\r\nthen played, whom we laughingly grew to call the \"Tennis Cabinet,\" have\r\nbeen mentioned in a previous chapter of this book in connection with\r\nthe gift they gave me at the last breakfast which they took at the White\r\nHouse. There were many others in the public service under me with whom I\r\nhappened not to play, but who did their share of our common work just as\r\neffectively as it was done by us who did play. Of course nothing could\r\nhave been done in my Administration if it had not been for the zeal,\r\nintelligence, masterful ability, and downright hard labor of these men\r\nin countless positions under me. I was helpless to do anything except\r\nas my thoughts and orders were translated into action by them; and,\r\nmoreover, each of them, as he grew specially fit for his job, used to\r\nsuggest to me the right thought to have, and the right order to give,\r\nconcerning that job. It is of course hard for me to speak with cold and\r\ndispassionate partiality of these men, who were as close to me as were\r\nthe men of my regiment. But the outside observers best fitted to pass\r\njudgment about them felt as I did. At the end of my Administration Mr.\r\nBryce, the British Ambassador, told me that in a long life, during which\r\nhe had studied intimately the government of many different countries, he\r\nhad never in any country seen a more eager, high-minded, and efficient\r\nset of public servants, men more useful and more creditable to their\r\ncountry, than the men then doing the work of the American Government in\r\nWashington and in the field. I repeat this statement with the permission\r\nof Mr. Bryce.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time, or a little before, in the spring of 1908, there\r\nappeared in the English _Fortnightly Review_ an article, evidently by\r\na competent eye witness, setting forth more in detail the same views to\r\nwhich the British Ambassador thus privately gave expression. It was in\r\npart as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Roosevelt has gathered around him a body of public servants who\r\nare nowhere surpassed, I question whether they are anywhere equaled, for\r\nefficiency, self-sacrifice, and an absolute devotion to their country's\r\ninterests. Many of them are poor men, without private means, who have\r\nvoluntarily abandoned high professional ambitions and turned their backs\r\non the rewards of business to serve their country on salaries that are\r\nnot merely inadequate, but indecently so. There is not one of them\r\nwho is not constantly assailed by offers of positions in the world\r\nof commerce, finance, and the law that would satisfy every material\r\nambition with which he began life. There is not one of them who could\r\nnot, if he chose, earn outside Washington from ten to twenty times the\r\nincome on which he economizes as a State official. But these men are\r\nas indifferent to money and to the power that money brings as to the\r\nallurements of Newport and New York, or to merely personal distinctions,\r\nor to the commercialized ideals which the great bulk of their\r\nfellow-countrymen accept without question. They are content, and more\r\nthan content, to sink themselves in the National service without a\r\nthought of private advancement, and often at a heavy sacrifice of\r\nworldly honors, and to toil on . . . sustained by their own native\r\nimpulse to make of patriotism an efficient instrument of public\r\nbetterment.\"\r\n\r\nThe American public rarely appreciate the high quality of the work\r\ndone by some of our diplomats--work, usually entirely unnoticed and\r\nunrewarded, which redounds to the interest and the honor of all of\r\nus. The most useful man in the entire diplomatic service, during my\r\npresidency, and for many years before, was Henry White; and I say\r\nthis having in mind the high quality of work done by such admirable\r\nambassadors and ministers as Bacon, Meyer, Straus, O'Brien, Rockhill,\r\nand Egan, to name only a few among many. When I left the presidency\r\nWhite was Ambassador to France; shortly afterwards he was removed by Mr.\r\nTaft, for reasons unconnected with the good of the service.\r\n\r\nThe most important factor in getting the right spirit in my\r\nAdministration, next to the insistence upon courage, honesty, and a\r\ngenuine democracy of desire to serve the plain people, was my insistence\r\nupon the theory that the executive power was limited only by specific\r\nrestrictions and prohibitions appearing in the Constitution or imposed\r\nby the Congress under its Constitutional powers. My view was that\r\nevery executive officer, and above all every executive officer in high\r\nposition, was a steward of the people bound actively and affirmatively\r\nto do all he could for the people, and not to content himself with the\r\nnegative merit of keeping his talents undamaged in a napkin. I declined\r\nto adopt the view that what was imperatively necessary for the Nation\r\ncould not be done by the President unless he could find some specific\r\nauthorization to do it. My belief was that it was not only his right\r\nbut his duty to do anything that the needs of the Nation demanded unless\r\nsuch action was forbidden by the Constitution or by the laws. Under\r\nthis interpretation of executive power I did and caused to be done\r\nmany things not previously done by the President and the heads of the\r\ndepartments. I did not usurp power, but I did greatly broaden the use of\r\nexecutive power. In other words, I acted for the public welfare, I acted\r\nfor the common well-being of all our people, whenever and in whatever\r\nmanner was necessary, unless prevented by direct constitutional or\r\nlegislative prohibition. I did not care a rap for the mere form and\r\nshow of power; I cared immensely for the use that could be made of the\r\nsubstance. The Senate at one time objected to my communicating with them\r\nin printing, preferring the expensive, foolish, and laborious practice\r\nof writing out the messages by hand. It was not possible to return to\r\nthe outworn archaism of hand writing; but we endeavored to have the\r\nprinting made as pretty as possible. Whether I communicated with the\r\nCongress in writing or by word of mouth, and whether the writing was by\r\na machine, or a pen, were equally, and absolutely, unimportant matters.\r\nThe importance lay in what I said and in the heed paid to what I said.\r\nSo as to my meeting and consulting Senators, Congressmen, politicians,\r\nfinanciers, and labor men. I consulted all who wished to see me; and if\r\nI wished to see any one, I sent for him; and where the consultation took\r\nplace was a matter of supreme unimportance. I consulted every man\r\nwith the sincere hope that I could profit by and follow his advice; I\r\nconsulted every member of Congress who wished to be consulted, hoping to\r\nbe able to come to an agreement of action with him; and I always finally\r\nacted as my conscience and common sense bade me act.\r\n\r\nAbout appointments I was obliged by the Constitution to consult the\r\nSenate; and the long-established custom of the Senate meant that in\r\npractice this consultation was with individual Senators and even with\r\nbig politicians who stood behind the Senators. I was only one-half the\r\nappointing power; I nominated; but the Senate confirmed. In practice,\r\nby what was called \"the courtesy of the Senate,\" the Senate normally\r\nrefused to confirm any appointment if the Senator from the State\r\nobjected to it. In exceptional cases, where I could arouse public\r\nattention, I could force through the appointment in spite of the\r\nopposition of the Senators; in all ordinary cases this was impossible.\r\nOn the other hand, the Senator could of course do nothing for any man\r\nunless I chose to nominate him. In consequence the Constitution itself\r\nforced the President and the Senators from each State to come to a\r\nworking agreement on the appointments in and from that State.\r\n\r\nMy course was to insist on absolute fitness, including honesty, as a\r\nprerequisite to every appointment; and to remove only for good cause,\r\nand, where there was such cause, to refuse even to discuss with the\r\nSenator in interest the unfit servant's retention. Subject to these\r\nconsiderations, I normally accepted each Senator's recommendations for\r\noffices of a routine kind, such as most post-offices and the like, but\r\ninsisted on myself choosing the men for the more important positions.\r\nI was willing to take any good man for postmaster; but in the case of\r\na Judge or District Attorney or Canal Commissioner or Ambassador, I\r\nwas apt to insist either on a given man or else on any man with a given\r\nclass of qualifications. If the Senator deceived me, I took care that he\r\nhad no opportunity to repeat the deception.\r\n\r\nI can perhaps best illustrate my theory of action by two specific\r\nexamples. In New York Governor Odell and Senator Platt sometimes worked\r\nin agreement and sometimes were at swords' points, and both wished to be\r\nconsulted. To a friendly Congressman, who was also their friend, I wrote\r\nas follows on July 22, 1903:\r\n\r\n\"I want to work with Platt. I want to work with Odell. I want to support\r\nboth and take the advice of both. But of course ultimately I must be\r\nthe judge as to acting on the advice given. When, as in the case of the\r\njudgeship, I am convinced that the advice of both is wrong, I shall act\r\nas I did when I appointed Holt. When I can find a friend of Odell's\r\nlike Cooley, who is thoroughly fit for the position I desire to fill, it\r\ngives me the greatest pleasure to appoint him. When Platt proposes to me\r\na man like Hamilton Fish, it is equally a pleasure to appoint him.\"\r\n\r\nThis was written in connection with events which led up to my refusing\r\nto accept Senator Platt's or Governor Odell's suggestions as to a\r\nFederal Judgeship and a Federal District Attorneyship, and insisting\r\non the appointment, first of Judge Hough and later of District Attorney\r\nStimson; because in each case I felt that the work to be done was of so\r\nhigh an order that I could not take an ordinary man.\r\n\r\nThe other case was that of Senator Fulton, of Oregon. Through Francis\r\nHeney I was prosecuting men who were implicated in a vast network of\r\nconspiracy against the law in connection with the theft of public land\r\nin Oregon. I had been acting on Senator Fulton's recommendations for\r\noffice, in the usual manner. Heney had been insisting that Fulton was\r\nin league with the men we were prosecuting, and that he had recommended\r\nunfit men. Fulton had been protesting against my following Heney's\r\nadvice, particularly as regards appointing Judge Wolverton as United\r\nStates Judge. Finally Heney laid before me a report which convinced me\r\nof the truth of his statements. I then wrote to Fulton as follows, on\r\nNovember 20, 1905: \"My dear Senator Fulton: I inclose you herewith a\r\ncopy of the report made to me by Mr. Heney. I have seen the originals\r\nof the letters from you and Senator Mitchell quoted therein. I do not\r\nat this time desire to discuss the report itself, which of course I must\r\nsubmit to the Attorney-General. But I have been obliged to reach the\r\npainful conclusion that your own letters as therein quoted tend to show\r\nthat you recommended for the position of District Attorney B when you\r\nhad good reason to believe that he had himself been guilty of fraudulent\r\nconduct; that you recommended C for the same position simply because it\r\nwas for B's interest that he should be so recommended, and, as there is\r\nreason to believe, because he had agreed to divide the fees with B if he\r\nwere appointed; and that you finally recommended the reappointment of\r\nH with the knowledge that if H were appointed he would abstain from\r\nprosecuting B for criminal misconduct, this being why B advocated H's\r\nclaims for reappointment. If you care to make any statement in the\r\nmatter, I shall of course be glad to hear it. As the District Judge of\r\nOregon I shall appoint Judge Wolverton.\" In the letter I of course gave\r\nin full the names indicated above by initials. Senator Fulton gave no\r\nexplanation. I therefore ceased to consult him about appointments under\r\nthe Department of Justice and the Interior, the two departments in which\r\nthe crookedness had occurred--there was no question of crookedness\r\nin the other offices in the State, and they could be handled in the\r\nordinary manner. Legal proceedings were undertaken against his colleague\r\nin the Senate, and one of his colleagues in the lower house, and the\r\nformer was convicted and sentenced to the penitentiary.\r\n\r\nIn a number of instances the legality of executive acts of my\r\nAdministration was brought before the courts. They were uniformly\r\nsustained. For example, prior to 1907 statutes relating to the\r\ndisposition of coal lands had been construed as fixing the flat price at\r\n$10 to $20 per acre. The result was that valuable coal lands were sold\r\nfor wholly inadequate prices, chiefly to big corporations. By executive\r\norder the coal lands were withdrawn and not opened for entry until\r\nproper classification was placed thereon by Government agents. There was\r\na great clamor that I was usurping legislative power; but the acts were\r\nnot assailed in court until we brought suits to set aside entries made\r\nby persons and associations to obtain larger areas than the statutes\r\nauthorized. This position was opposed on the ground that the\r\nrestrictions imposed were illegal; that the executive orders were\r\nillegal. The Supreme Court sustained the Government. In the same way our\r\nattitude in the water power question was sustained, the Supreme Court\r\nholding that the Federal Government had the rights we claimed over\r\nstreams that are or may be declared navigable by Congress. Again, when\r\nOklahoma became a State we were obliged to use the executive power\r\nto protect Indian rights and property, for there had been an enormous\r\namount of fraud in the obtaining of Indian lands by white men. Here we\r\nwere denounced as usurping power over a State as well as usurping power\r\nthat did not belong to the executive. The Supreme Court sustained our\r\naction.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the Indians, by the way, it was again and again\r\nnecessary to assert the position of the President as steward of the\r\nwhole people. I had a capital Indian Commissioner, Francis E. Leupp. I\r\nfound that I could rely on his judgment not to get me into fights that\r\nwere unnecessary, and therefore I always backed him to the limit when\r\nhe told me that a fight was necessary. On one occasion, for example,\r\nCongress passed a bill to sell to settlers about half a million acres of\r\nIndian land in Oklahoma at one and a half dollars an acre. I refused to\r\nsign it, and turned the matter over to Leupp. The bill was accordingly\r\nwithdrawn, amended so as to safeguard the welfare of the Indians, and\r\nthe minimum price raised to five dollars an acre. Then I signed the\r\nbill. We sold that land under sealed bids, and realized for the Kiowa,\r\nComanche, and Apache Indians more than four million dollars--three\r\nmillions and a quarter more than they would have obtained if I had\r\nsigned the bill in its original form. In another case, where there\r\nhad been a division among the Sac and Fox Indians, part of the tribe\r\nremoving to Iowa, the Iowa delegation in Congress, backed by two Iowans\r\nwho were members of my Cabinet, passed a bill awarding a sum of nearly\r\na half million dollars to the Iowa seceders. They had not consulted\r\nthe Indian Bureau. Leupp protested against the bill, and I vetoed it. A\r\nsubsequent bill was passed on the lines laid down by the Indian Bureau,\r\nreferring the whole controversy to the courts, and the Supreme Court in\r\nthe end justified our position by deciding against the Iowa seceders and\r\nawarding the money to the Oklahoma stay-at-homes.\r\n\r\nAs to all action of this kind there have long been two schools of\r\npolitical thought, upheld with equal sincerity. The division has not\r\nnormally been along political, but temperamental, lines. The course I\r\nfollowed, of regarding the executive as subject only to the people, and,\r\nunder the Constitution, bound to serve the people affirmatively in cases\r\nwhere the Constitution does not explicitly forbid him to render the\r\nservice, was substantially the course followed by both Andrew Jackson\r\nand Abraham Lincoln. Other honorable and well-meaning Presidents, such\r\nas James Buchanan, took the opposite and, as it seems to me, narrowly\r\nlegalistic view that the President is the servant of Congress rather\r\nthan of the people, and can do nothing, no matter how necessary it be to\r\nact, unless the Constitution explicitly commands the action. Most able\r\nlawyers who are past middle age take this view, and so do large numbers\r\nof well-meaning, respectable citizens. My successor in office took this,\r\nthe Buchanan, view of the President's powers and duties.\r\n\r\nFor example, under my Administration we found that one of the favorite\r\nmethods adopted by the men desirous of stealing the public domain was\r\nto carry the decision of the Secretary of the Interior into court. By\r\nvigorously opposing such action, and only by so doing, we were able\r\nto carry out the policy of properly protecting the public domain. My\r\nsuccessor not only took the opposite view, but recommended to Congress\r\nthe passage of a bill which would have given the courts direct appellate\r\npower over the Secretary of the Interior in these land matters. This\r\nbill was reported favorably by Mr. Mondell, Chairman of the House\r\nCommittee on public lands, a Congressman who took the lead in every\r\nmeasure to prevent the conservation of our natural resources and\r\nthe preservation of the National domain for the use of home-seekers.\r\nFortunately, Congress declined to pass the bill. Its passage would have\r\nbeen a veritable calamity.\r\n\r\nI acted on the theory that the President could at any time in his\r\ndiscretion withdraw from entry any of the public lands of the United\r\nStates and reserve the same for forestry, for water-power sites, for\r\nirrigation, and other public purposes. Without such action it would\r\nhave been impossible to stop the activity of the land thieves. No one\r\nventured to test its legality by lawsuit. My successor, however, himself\r\nquestioned it, and referred the matter to Congress. Again Congress\r\nshowed its wisdom by passing a law which gave the President the power\r\nwhich he had long exercised, and of which my successor had shorn\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the sharp difference between what may be called the\r\nLincoln-Jackson and the Buchanan-Taft schools, in their views of the\r\npower and duties of the President, may be best illustrated by comparing\r\nthe attitude of my successor toward his Secretary of the Interior, Mr.\r\nBallinger, when the latter was accused of gross misconduct in office,\r\nwith my attitude towards my chiefs of department and other subordinate\r\nofficers. More than once while I was President my officials were\r\nattacked by Congress, generally because these officials did their duty\r\nwell and fearlessly. In every such case I stood by the official\r\nand refused to recognize the right of Congress to interfere with me\r\nexcepting by impeachment or in other Constitutional manner. On the other\r\nhand, wherever I found the officer unfit for his position I promptly\r\nremoved him, even although the most influential men in Congress fought\r\nfor his retention. The Jackson-Lincoln view is that a President who is\r\nfit to do good work should be able to form his own judgment as to his\r\nown subordinates, and, above all, of the subordinates standing highest\r\nand in closest and most intimate touch with him. My secretaries\r\nand their subordinates were responsible to me, and I accepted the\r\nresponsibility for all their deeds. As long as they were satisfactory to\r\nme I stood by them against every critic or assailant, within or without\r\nCongress; and as for getting Congress to make up my mind for me about\r\nthem, the thought would have been inconceivable to me. My successor took\r\nthe opposite, or Buchanan, view when he permitted and requested Congress\r\nto pass judgment on the charges made against Mr. Ballinger as an\r\nexecutive officer. These charges were made to the President; the\r\nPresident had the facts before him and could get at them at any time,\r\nand he alone had power to act if the charges were true. However, he\r\npermitted and requested Congress to investigate Mr. Ballinger. The party\r\nminority of the committee that investigated him, and one member of\r\nthe majority, declared that the charges were well founded and that Mr.\r\nBallinger should be removed. The other members of the majority declared\r\nthe charges ill founded. The President abode by the view of the\r\nmajority. Of course believers in the Jackson-Lincoln theory of the\r\nPresidency would not be content with this town meeting majority and\r\nminority method of determining by another branch of the Government what\r\nit seems the especial duty of the President himself to determine for\r\nhimself in dealing with his own subordinate in his own department.\r\n\r\nThere are many worthy people who reprobate the Buchanan method as a\r\nmatter of history, but who in actual life reprobate still more strongly\r\nthe Jackson-Lincoln method when it is put into practice. These persons\r\nconscientiously believe that the President should solve every doubt in\r\nfavor of inaction as against action, that he should construe strictly\r\nand narrowly the Constitutional grant of powers both to the National\r\nGovernment, and to the President within the National Government. In\r\naddition, however, to the men who conscientiously believe in this course\r\nfrom high, although as I hold misguided, motives, there are many men who\r\naffect to believe in it merely because it enables them to attack and to\r\ntry to hamper, for partisan or personal reasons, an executive whom\r\nthey dislike. There are other men in whom, especially when they are\r\nthemselves in office, practical adherence to the Buchanan principle\r\nrepresents not well-thought-out devotion to an unwise course, but simple\r\nweakness of character and desire to avoid trouble and responsibility.\r\nUnfortunately, in practice it makes little difference which class\r\nof ideas actuates the President, who by his action sets a cramping\r\nprecedent. Whether he is highminded and wrongheaded or merely infirm\r\nof purpose, whether he means well feebly or is bound by a mischievous\r\nmisconception of the powers and duties of the National Government and\r\nof the President, the effect of his actions is the same. The President's\r\nduty is to act so that he himself and his subordinates shall be able to\r\ndo efficient work for the people, and this efficient work he and they\r\ncannot do if Congress is permitted to undertake the task of making up\r\nhis mind for him as to how he shall perform what is clearly his sole\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nOne of the ways in which by independent action of the executive we were\r\nable to accomplish an immense amount of work for the public was through\r\nvolunteer unpaid commissions appointed by the President. It was possible\r\nto get the work done by these volunteer commissions only because of the\r\nenthusiasm for the public service which, starting in the higher\r\noffices at Washington, made itself felt throughout the Government\r\ndepartments--as I have said, I never knew harder and more disinterested\r\nwork done by any people than was done by the men and women of all ranks\r\nin the Government service. The contrast was really extraordinary between\r\ntheir live interest in their work and the traditional clerical apathy\r\nwhich has so often been the distinguishing note of governmental work\r\nin Washington. Most of the public service performed by these volunteer\r\ncommissions, carried on without a cent of pay to the men themselves,\r\nand wholly without cost to the Government, was done by men the great\r\nmajority of whom were already in the Government service and already\r\ncharged with responsibilities amounting each to a full man's job.\r\n\r\nThe first of these Commissions was the Commission on the Organization\r\nof Government Scientific Work, whose Chairman was Charles D. Walcott.\r\nAppointed March 13, 1903, its duty was to report directly to the\r\nPresident \"upon the organization, present condition, and needs of the\r\nExecutive Government work wholly or partly scientific in character, and\r\nupon the steps which should be taken, if any, to prevent the duplication\r\nof such work, to co-ordinate its various branches, to increase its\r\nefficiency and economy, and to promote its usefulness to the Nation\r\nat large.\" This Commission spent four months in an examination which\r\ncovered the work of about thirty of the larger scientific and executive\r\nbureaus of the Government, and prepared a report which furnished the\r\nbasis for numerous improvements in the Government service.\r\n\r\nAnother Commission, appointed June 2, 1905, was that on Department\r\nMethods--Charles H. Keep, Chairman--whose task was to \"find out what\r\nchanges are needed to place the conduct of the executive business of\r\nthe Government in all its branches on the most economical and effective\r\nbasis in the light of the best modern business practice.\" The letter\r\nappointing this Commission laid down nine principles of effective\r\nGovernmental work, the most striking of which was: \"The existence of any\r\nmethod, standard, custom, or practice is no reason for its continuance\r\nwhen a better is offered.\" This Commission, composed like that just\r\ndescribed, of men already charged with important work, performed its\r\nfunctions wholly without cost to the Government. It was assisted by a\r\nbody of about seventy experts in the Government departments chosen\r\nfor their special qualifications to carry forward a study of the best\r\nmethods in business, and organized into assistant committees under\r\nthe leadership of Overton W. Price, Secretary of the Commission. These\r\nassistant committees, all of whose members were still carrying on their\r\nregular work, made their reports during the last half of 1906. The\r\nCommittee informed itself fully regarding the business methods of\r\npractically every individual branch of the business of the Government,\r\nand effected a marked improvement in general efficiency throughout the\r\nservice. The conduct of the routine business of the Government had never\r\nbeen thoroughly overhauled before, and this examination of it resulted\r\nin the promulgation of a set of working principles for the transaction\r\nof public business which are as sound to-day as they were when\r\nthe Committee finished its work. The somewhat elaborate and costly\r\ninvestigations of Government business methods since made have served\r\nmerely to confirm the findings of the Committee on Departmental Methods,\r\nwhich were achieved without costing the Government a dollar. The actual\r\nsaving in the conduct of the business of the Government through the\r\nbetter methods thus introduced amounted yearly to many hundreds of\r\nthousands of dollars; but a far more important gain was due to the\r\nremarkable success of the Commission in establishing a new point of view\r\nin public servants toward their work.\r\n\r\nThe need for improvement in the Governmental methods of transacting\r\nbusiness may be illustrated by an actual case. An officer in charge of\r\nan Indian agency made a requisition in the autumn for a stove costing\r\nseven dollars, certifying at the same time that it was needed to keep\r\nthe infirmary warm during the winter, because the old stove was worn\r\nout. Thereupon the customary papers went through the customary routine,\r\nwithout unusual delay at any point. The transaction moved like a glacier\r\nwith dignity to its appointed end, and the stove reached the infirmary\r\nin good order in time for the Indian agent to acknowledge its arrival in\r\nthese words: \"The stove is here. So is spring.\"\r\n\r\nThe Civil Service Commission, under men like John McIlhenny and\r\nGarfield, rendered service without which the Government could have been\r\nconducted with neither efficiency nor honesty. The politicians were\r\nnot the only persons at fault; almost as much improper pressure for\r\nappointments is due to mere misplaced sympathy, and to the spiritless\r\ninefficiency which seeks a Government office as a haven for the\r\nincompetent. An amusing feature of office seeking is that each man\r\ndesiring an office is apt to look down on all others with the same\r\nobject as forming an objectionable class with which _he_ has nothing in\r\ncommon. At the time of the eruption of Mt. Pelee, when among others\r\nthe American Consul was killed, a man who had long been seeking an\r\nappointment promptly applied for the vacancy. He was a good man, of\r\npersistent nature, who felt I had been somewhat blind to his merits. The\r\nmorning after the catastrophe he wrote, saying that as the consul was\r\ndead he would like his place, and that I could surely give it to him,\r\nbecause \"even the office seekers could not have applied for it yet!\"\r\n\r\nThe method of public service involved in the appointment and the work of\r\nthe two commissions just described was applied also in the establishment\r\nof four other commissions, each of which performed its task without\r\nsalary or expense for its members, and wholly without cost to the\r\nGovernment. The other four commissions were:\r\n\r\nCommission on Public Lands;\r\n\r\nCommission on Inland Waterways;\r\n\r\nCommission on Country Life; and\r\n\r\nCommission on National Conservation.\r\n\r\nAll of these commissions were suggested to me by Gifford Pinchot, who\r\nserved upon them all. The work of the last four will be touched upon in\r\nconnection with the chapter on Conservation. These commissions by their\r\nreports and findings directly interfered with many place-holders who\r\nwere doing inefficient work, and their reports and the action\r\ntaken thereon by the Administration strengthened the hands of those\r\nadministrative officers who in the various departments, and especially\r\nin the Secret Service, were proceeding against land thieves and other\r\ncorrupt wrong-doers. Moreover, the mere fact that they did efficient\r\nwork for the public along lines new to veteran and cynical politicians\r\nof the old type created vehement hostility to them. Senators like Mr.\r\nHale and Congressmen like Mr. Tawney were especially bitter against\r\nthese commissions; and towards the end of my term they were followed\r\nby the majority of their fellows in both houses, who had gradually been\r\nsundered from me by the open or covert hostility of the financial or\r\nWall Street leaders, and of the newspaper editors and politicians who\r\ndid their bidding in the interest of privilege. These Senators and\r\nCongressmen asserted that they had a right to forbid the President\r\nprofiting by the unpaid advice of disinterested experts. Of course I\r\ndeclined to admit the existence of any such right, and continued the\r\nCommissions. My successor acknowledged the right, upheld the view of the\r\npoliticians in question, and abandoned the commissions, to the lasting\r\ndetriment of the people as a whole.\r\n\r\nOne thing is worth pointing out: During the seven and a half years of\r\nmy Administration we greatly and usefully extended the sphere of\r\nGovernmental action, and yet we reduced the burden of the taxpayers;\r\nfor we reduced the interest-bearing debt by more than $90,000,000. To\r\nachieve a marked increase in efficiency and at the same time an increase\r\nin economy is not an easy feat; but we performed it.\r\n\r\nThere was one ugly and very necessary task. This was to discover and\r\nroot out corruption wherever it was found in any of the departments. The\r\nfirst essential was to make it clearly understood that no political or\r\nbusiness or social influence of any kind would for one moment be even\r\nconsidered when the honesty of a public official was at issue. It took\r\na little time to get this fact thoroughly drilled into the heads both\r\nof the men within the service and of the political leaders without. The\r\nfeat was accomplished so thoroughly that every effort to interfere in\r\nany shape or way with the course of justice was abandoned definitely and\r\nfor good. Most, although not all, of the frauds occurred in connection\r\nwith the Post-Office Department and the Land Office.\r\n\r\nIt was in the Post-Office Department that we first definitely\r\nestablished the rule of conduct which became universal throughout the\r\nwhole service. Rumors of corruption in the department became rife, and\r\nfinally I spoke of them to the then First Assistant Postmaster-General,\r\nafterwards Postmaster-General, Robert J. Wynne. He reported to me, after\r\nsome investigation, that in his belief there was doubtless corruption,\r\nbut that it was very difficult to get at it, and that the offenders\r\nwere confident and defiant because of their great political and business\r\nbacking and the ramifications of their crimes. Talking the matter over\r\nwith him, I came to the conclusion that the right man to carry on the\r\ninvestigation was the then Fourth Assistant Postmaster-General, now\r\na Senator from Kansas, Joseph L. Bristow, who possessed the iron\r\nfearlessness needful to front such a situation. Mr. Bristow had perforce\r\nseen a good deal of the seamy side of politics, and of the extent of the\r\nunscrupulousness with which powerful influence was brought to bear to\r\nshield offenders. Before undertaking the investigation he came to see\r\nme, and said that he did not wish to go into it unless he could be\r\nassured that I would stand personally behind him, and, no matter where\r\nhis inquiries led him, would support him and prevent interference\r\nwith him. I answered that I would certainly do so. He went into\r\nthe investigation with relentless energy, dogged courage, and keen\r\nintelligence. His success was complete, and the extent of his services\r\nto the Nation are not easily to be exaggerated. He unearthed a really\r\nappalling amount of corruption, and he did his work with such absolute\r\nthoroughness that the corruption was completely eradicated.\r\n\r\nWe had, of course, the experience usual in all such investigations. At\r\nfirst there was popular incredulity and disbelief that there was much\r\nbehind the charges, or that much could be unearthed. Then when the\r\ncorruption was shown there followed a yell of anger from all directions,\r\nand a period during which any man accused was forthwith held guilty\r\nby the public; and violent demands were made by the newspapers for the\r\nprosecution not only of the men who could be prosecuted with a fair\r\nchance of securing conviction and imprisonment, but of other men whose\r\nmisconduct had been such as to warrant my removing them from office, but\r\nagainst whom it was not possible to get the kind of evidence which would\r\nrender likely conviction in a criminal case. Suits were brought against\r\nall the officials whom we thought we could convict; and the public\r\ncomplained bitterly that we did not bring further suits. We secured\r\nseveral convictions, including convictions of the most notable\r\noffenders. The trials consumed a good deal of time. Public attention was\r\nattracted to something else. Indifference succeeded to excitement, and\r\nin some subtle way the juries seemed to respond to the indifference. One\r\nof the worst offenders was acquitted by a jury; whereupon not a few of\r\nthe same men who had insisted that the Government was derelict in not\r\ncriminally prosecuting every man whose misconduct was established so as\r\nto make it necessary to turn him out of office, now turned round and,\r\ninasmuch as the jury had not found this man guilty of crime, demanded\r\nthat he should be reinstated in office! It is needless to say that the\r\ndemand was not granted. There were two or three other acquittals, of\r\nprominent outsiders. Nevertheless the net result was that the majority\r\nof the worst offenders were sent to prison, and the remainder dismissed\r\nfrom the Government service, if they were public officials, and if\r\nthey were not public officials at least so advertised as to render\r\nit impossible that they should ever again have dealings with the\r\nGovernment. The department was absolutely cleaned and became one of the\r\nvery best in the Government. Several Senators came to me--Mr. Garfield\r\nwas present on the occasion--and said that they were glad I was putting\r\na stop to corruption, but they hoped I would avoid all scandal; that if\r\nI would make an example of some one man and then let the others quietly\r\nresign, it would avoid a disturbance which might hurt the party. They\r\nwere advising me in good faith, and I was as courteous as possible in\r\nmy answer, but explained that I would have to act with the utmost rigor\r\nagainst the offenders, no matter what the effect on the party, and,\r\nmoreover, that I did not believe it would hurt the party. It did not\r\nhurt the party. It helped the party. A favorite war-cry in American\r\npolitical life has always been, \"Turn the rascals out.\" We made it\r\nevident that, as far as we were concerned, this war-cry was pointless;\r\nfor we turned our own rascals out.\r\n\r\nThere were important and successful land fraud prosecutions in several\r\nWestern States. Probably the most important were the cases prosecuted in\r\nOregon by Francis J. Heney, with the assistance of William J. Burns,\r\na secret service agent who at that time began his career as a great\r\ndetective. It would be impossible to overstate the services rendered to\r\nthe cause of decency and honesty by Messrs. Heney and Burns. Mr. Heney\r\nwas my close and intimate adviser professionally and non-professionally,\r\nnot only as regards putting a stop to frauds in the public lands, but\r\nin many other matters of vital interest to the Republic. No man in the\r\ncountry has waged the battle for National honesty with greater courage\r\nand success, with more whole-hearted devotion to the public good; and\r\nno man has been more traduced and maligned by the wrong-doing agents\r\nand representatives of the great sinister forces of evil. He secured the\r\nconviction of various men of high political and financial standing\r\nin connection with the Oregon prosecutions; he and Burns behaved with\r\nscrupulous fairness and propriety; but their services to the public\r\ncaused them to incur the bitter hatred of those who had wronged the\r\npublic, and after I left office the National Administration turned\r\nagainst them. One of the most conspicuous of the men whom they had\r\nsucceeded in convicting was pardoned by President Taft--in spite of the\r\nfact that the presiding Judge, Judge Hunt, had held that the\r\nevidence amply warranted the conviction, and had sentenced the man to\r\nimprisonment. As was natural, the one hundred and forty-six land-fraud\r\ndefendants in Oregon, who included the foremost machine political\r\nleaders in the State, furnished the backbone of the opposition to me in\r\nthe Presidential contest of 1912. The opposition rallied behind Messrs.\r\nTaft and LaFollette; and although I carried the primaries handsomely,\r\nhalf of the delegates elected from Oregon under instructions to vote for\r\nme, sided with my opponents in the National Convention--and as regards\r\nsome of them I became convinced that the mainspring of their motive\r\nlay in the intrigue for securing the pardon of certain of the men whose\r\nconviction Heney had secured.\r\n\r\nLand fraud and post-office cases were not the only ones. We were\r\nespecially zealous in prosecuting all of the \"higher up\" offenders\r\nin the realms of politics and finance who swindled on a large scale.\r\nSpecial assistants of the Attorney-General, such as Mr. Frank Kellogg,\r\nof St. Paul, and various first-class Federal district attorneys in\r\ndifferent parts of the country secured notable results: Mr. Stimson and\r\nhis assistants, Messrs. Wise, Denison, and Frankfurter, in New York, for\r\ninstance, in connection with the prosecution of the Sugar Trust and of\r\nthe banker Morse, and of a great metropolitan newspaper for opening its\r\ncolumns to obscene and immoral advertisements; and in St. Louis Messrs.\r\nDyer and Nortoni, who, among other services, secured the conviction and\r\nimprisonment of Senator Burton, of Kansas; and in Chicago Mr. Sims,\r\nwho raised his office to the highest pitch of efficiency, secured the\r\nconviction of the banker Walsh and of the Beef Trust, and first broke\r\nthrough the armor of the Standard Oil Trust. It is not too much to say\r\nthat these men, and others like them, worked a complete revolution in\r\nthe enforcement of the Federal laws, and made their offices organized\r\nlegal machines fit and ready to conduct smashing fights for the people's\r\nrights and to enforce the laws in aggressive fashion. When I took the\r\nPresidency, it was a common and bitter saying that a big man, a rich\r\nman, could not be put in jail. We put many big and rich men in jail;\r\ntwo United States Senators, for instance, and among others two great\r\nbankers, one in New York and one in Chicago. One of the United States\r\nSenators died, the other served his term. (One of the bankers was\r\nreleased from prison by executive order after I left office.) These were\r\nmerely individual cases among many others like them. Moreover, we\r\nwere just as relentless in dealing with crimes of violence among the\r\ndisorderly and brutal classes as in dealing with the crimes of cunning\r\nand fraud of which certain wealthy men and big politicians were guilty.\r\nMr. Sims in Chicago was particularly efficient in sending to the\r\npenitentiary numbers of the infamous men who batten on the \"white\r\nslave\" traffic, after July, 1908, when by proclamation I announced\r\nthe adherence of our Government to the international agreement for the\r\nsuppression of the traffic.\r\n\r\nThe views I then held and now hold were expressed in a memorandum made\r\nin the case of a Negro convicted of the rape of a young Negro girl,\r\npractically a child. A petition for his pardon had been sent me.\r\n\r\nWHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON, D. C., August 8, 1904.\r\n\r\nThe application for the commutation of sentence of John W. Burley is\r\ndenied. This man committed the most hideous crime known to our laws, and\r\ntwice before he has committed crimes of a similar, though less horrible,\r\ncharacter. In my judgment there is no justification whatever for paying\r\nheed to the allegations that he is not of sound mind, allegations made\r\nafter the trial and conviction. Nobody would pretend that there has ever\r\nbeen any such degree of mental unsoundness shown as would make people\r\neven consider sending him to an asylum if he had not committed this\r\ncrime. Under such circumstances he should certainly be esteemed sane\r\nenough to suffer the penalty for his monstrous deed. I have scant\r\nsympathy with the plea of insanity advanced to save a man from the\r\nconsequences of crime, when unless that crime had been committed it\r\nwould have been impossible to persuade any responsible authority to\r\ncommit him to an asylum as insane. Among the most dangerous criminals,\r\nand especially among those prone to commit this particular kind of\r\noffense, there are plenty of a temper so fiendish or so brutal as to be\r\nincompatible with any other than a brutish order of intelligence; but\r\nthese men are nevertheless responsible for their acts; and nothing more\r\ntends to encourage crime among such men than the belief that through the\r\nplea of insanity or any other method it is possible for them to escape\r\npaying the just penalty of their crimes. The crime in question is one\r\nto the existence of which we largely owe the existence of that spirit\r\nof lawlessness which takes form in lynching. It is a crime so revolting\r\nthat the criminal is not entitled to one particle of sympathy from any\r\nhuman being. It is essential that the punishment for it should be not\r\nonly as certain but as swift as possible. The jury in this case did\r\ntheir duty by recommending the infliction of the death penalty. It is\r\nto be regretted that we do not have special provision for more summary\r\ndealing with this type of case. The more we do what in us lies to\r\nsecure certain and swift justice in dealing with these cases, the more\r\neffectively do we work against the growth of that lynching spirit which\r\nis so full of evil omen for this people, because it seeks to avenge one\r\ninfamous crime by the commission of another of equal infamy.\r\n\r\nThe application is denied and the sentence will be carried into effect.\r\n\r\n(Signed) THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious incidents of lawlessness with which I had to\r\ndeal affected an entire State. The State of Nevada in the year 1907\r\nwas gradually drifting into utter governmental impotence and downright\r\nanarchy. The people were at heart all right; but the forces of evil had\r\nbeen permitted to get the upper hand, and for the time being the decent\r\ncitizens had become helpless to assert themselves either by controlling\r\nthe greedy corporations on the one hand or repressing the murderous\r\nviolence of certain lawless labor organizations on the other hand. The\r\nGovernor of the State was a Democrat and a Southern man, and in the\r\nabstract a strong believer in the doctrine of State's Rights. But his\r\nexperience finally convinced him that he could obtain order only through\r\nthe intervention of the National Government; and then he went over too\r\nfar and wished to have the National Government do his police work for\r\nhim. In the Rocky Mountain States there had existed for years what\r\nwas practically a condition of almost constant war between the wealthy\r\nmine-owners and the Western Federation of Miners, at whose head stood\r\nMessrs. Haywood, Pettibone, and Moyer, who were about that time indicted\r\nfor the murder of the Governor of Idaho. Much that was lawless, much\r\nthat was indefensible, had been done by both sides. The Legislature of\r\nNevada was in sympathy with, or at least was afraid of not expressing\r\nsympathy for, Messrs. Moyer, Haywood, Pettibone, and their associates.\r\nThe State was practically without any police, and the Governor had\r\nrecommended the establishment of a State Constabulary, along the lines\r\nof the Texas Rangers; but the Legislature rejected his request. The\r\nGovernor reported to me the conditions as follows. During 1907 the\r\nGoldfield mining district became divided into two hostile camps. Half\r\nof the Western Federation of Miners were constantly armed, and arms and\r\nammunition were purchased and kept by the union as a body, while the\r\nmine-owners on their side retained large numbers of watchmen and guards\r\nwho were also armed and always on duty. In addition to these opposing\r\nforces there was, as the Governor reported, an unusually large number of\r\nthe violent and criminal element, always attracted to a new and\r\nbooming mining camp. Under such conditions the civil authorities were\r\npractically powerless, and the Governor, being helpless to avert civil\r\nwar, called on me to keep order. I accordingly threw in a body of\r\nregular troops under General Funston. These kept order completely, and\r\nthe Governor became so well satisfied that he thought he would like\r\nto have them there permanently! This seemed to me unhealthy, and on\r\nDecember 28, 1907, I notified him that while I would do my duty, the\r\nfirst need was that the State authorities should do theirs, and that\r\nthe first step towards this was the assembling of the Legislature.\r\nI concluded my telegram: \"If within five days from receipt of this\r\ntelegram you shall have issued the necessary notice to convene the\r\nLegislature of Nevada, I shall continue the troops during a period of\r\nthree weeks. If when the term of five days has elapsed the notice has\r\nnot been issued, the troops will be immediately returned to their former\r\nstations.\" I had already investigated the situation through a committee,\r\ncomposed of the Chief of the Bureau of Corporations, Mr. H. K. Smith,\r\nthe Chief of the Bureau of Labor, Mr. C. P. Neill, and the Comptroller\r\nof the Treasury, Mr. Lawrence Murray. These men I could thoroughly\r\ntrust, and their report, which was not over-favorable to either side,\r\nhad convinced me that the only permanent way to get good results was to\r\ninsist on the people of the State themselves grappling with and solving\r\ntheir own troubles. The Governor summoned the Legislature, it met, and\r\nthe constabulary bill was passed. The troops remained in Nevada until\r\ntime had been given for the State authorities to organize their force so\r\nthat violence could at once be checked. Then they were withdrawn.\r\n\r\nNor was it only as regards their own internal affairs that I sometimes\r\nhad to get into active communication with the State authorities. There\r\nhas always been a strong feeling in California against the immigration\r\nof Asiatic laborers, whether these are wage-workers or men who occupy\r\nand till the soil. I believe this to be fundamentally a sound and proper\r\nattitude, an attitude which must be insisted upon, and yet which can be\r\ninsisted upon in such a manner and with such courtesy and such sense of\r\nmutual fairness and reciprocal obligation and respect as not to give any\r\njust cause of offense to Asiatic peoples. In the present state of\r\nthe world's progress it is highly inadvisable that peoples in wholly\r\ndifferent stages of civilization, or of wholly different types of\r\ncivilization even although both equally high, shall be thrown into\r\nintimate contact. This is especially undesirable when there is a\r\ndifference of both race and standard of living. In California the\r\nquestion became acute in connection with the admission of the Japanese.\r\nI then had and now have a hearty admiration for the Japanese people.\r\nI believe in them; I respect their great qualities; I wish that our\r\nAmerican people had many of these qualities. Japanese and American\r\nstudents, travelers, scientific and literary men, merchants engaged in\r\ninternational trade, and the like can meet on terms of entire equality\r\nand should be given the freest access each to the country of the other.\r\nBut the Japanese themselves would not tolerate the intrusion into\r\ntheir country of a mass of Americans who would displace Japanese in the\r\nbusiness of the land. I think they are entirely right in this position.\r\nI would be the first to admit that Japan has the absolute right to\r\ndeclare on what terms foreigners shall be admitted to work in her\r\ncountry, or to own land in her country, or to become citizens of her\r\ncountry. America has and must insist upon the same right. The people\r\nof California were right in insisting that the Japanese should not\r\ncome thither in mass, that there should be no influx of laborers, of\r\nagricultural workers, or small tradesmen--in short, no mass settlement\r\nor immigration.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, during the latter part of my term as President certain\r\nunwise and demagogic agitators in California, to show their disapproval\r\nof the Japanese coming into the State, adopted the very foolish\r\nprocedure of trying to provide by law that the Japanese children should\r\nnot be allowed to attend the schools with the white children, and\r\noffensive and injurious language was used in connection with the\r\nproposal. The Federal Administration promptly took up the matter with\r\nthe California authorities, and I got into personal touch with them. At\r\nmy request the Mayor of San Francisco and other leaders in the movement\r\ncame on to see me. I explained that the duty of the National Government\r\nwas twofold: in the first place, to meet every reasonable wish and every\r\nreal need of the people of California or any other State in dealing\r\nwith the people of a foreign power; and, in the next place, itself\r\nexclusively and fully to exercise the right of dealing with this foreign\r\npower.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as in the last resort, including that last of all resorts, war,\r\nthe dealing of necessity had to be between the foreign power and the\r\nNational Government, it was impossible to admit that the doctrine\r\nof State sovereignty could be invoked in such a matter. As soon as\r\nlegislative or other action in any State affects a foreign nation, then\r\nthe affair becomes one for the Nation, and the State should deal with\r\nthe foreign power purely through the Nation.\r\n\r\nI explained that I was in entire sympathy with the people of California\r\nas to the subject of immigration of the Japanese in mass; but that of\r\ncourse I wished to accomplish the object they had in view in the way\r\nthat would be most courteous and most agreeable to the feelings of the\r\nJapanese; that all relations between the two peoples must be those of\r\nreciprocal justice, and that it was an intolerable outrage on the part\r\nof newspapers and public men to use offensive and insulting language\r\nabout a high-spirited, sensitive, and friendly people; and that such\r\naction as was proposed about the schools could only have bad effects,\r\nand would in no shape or way achieve the purpose that the Californians\r\nhad in mind. I also explained that I would use every resource of the\r\nNational Government to protect the Japanese in their treaty rights, and\r\nwould count upon the State authorities backing me up to the limit in\r\nsuch action. In short, I insisted upon the two points (1) that the\r\nNation and not the individual States must deal with matters of such\r\ninternational significance and must treat foreign nations with entire\r\ncourtesy and respect; and (2) that the Nation would at once, and in\r\nefficient and satisfactory manner, take action that would meet the needs\r\nof California. I both asserted the power of the Nation and offered a\r\nfull remedy for the needs of the State. This is the right, and the only\r\nright, course. The worst possible course in such a case is to fail to\r\ninsist on the right of the Nation, to offer no action of the Nation to\r\nremedy what is wrong, and yet to try to coax the State not to do what\r\nit is mistakenly encouraged to believe it has the power to do, when no\r\nother alternative is offered.\r\n\r\nAfter a good deal of discussion, we came to an entirely satisfactory\r\nconclusion. The obnoxious school legislation was abandoned, and I\r\nsecured an arrangement with Japan under which the Japanese themselves\r\nprevented any immigration to our country of their laboring people, it\r\nbeing distinctly understood that if there was such emigration the United\r\nStates would at once pass an exclusion law. It was of course infinitely\r\nbetter that the Japanese should stop their own people from coming rather\r\nthan that we should have to stop them; but it was necessary for us to\r\nhold this power in reserve.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, after I left office, a most mistaken and ill-advised\r\npolicy was pursued towards Japan, combining irritation and inefficiency,\r\nwhich culminated in a treaty under which we surrendered this important\r\nand necessary right. It was alleged in excuse that the treaty provided\r\nfor its own abrogation; but of course it is infinitely better to have a\r\ntreaty under which the power to exercise a necessary right is explicitly\r\nretained rather than a treaty so drawn that recourse must be had to the\r\nextreme step of abrogating if it ever becomes necessary to exercise the\r\nright in question.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement we made worked admirably, and entirely achieved its\r\npurpose. No small part of our success was due to the fact that we\r\nsucceeded in impressing on the Japanese that we sincerely admired and\r\nrespected them, and desired to treat them with the utmost consideration.\r\nI cannot too strongly express my indignation with, and abhorrence\r\nof, reckless public writers and speakers who, with coarse and vulgar\r\ninsolence, insult the Japanese people and thereby do the greatest wrong\r\nnot only to Japan but to their own country.\r\n\r\nSuch conduct represents that nadir of underbreeding and folly. The\r\nJapanese are one of the great nations of the world, entitled to stand,\r\nand standing, on a footing of full equality with any nation of Europe\r\nor America. I have the heartiest admiration for them. They can teach us\r\nmuch. Their civilization is in some respects higher than our own. It is\r\neminently undesirable that Japanese and Americans should attempt to\r\nlive together in masses; any such attempt would be sure to result\r\ndisastrously, and the far-seeing statesmen of both countries should join\r\nto prevent it.\r\n\r\nBut this is not because either nation is inferior to the other; it is\r\nbecause they are different. The two peoples represent two civilizations\r\nwhich, although in many respects equally high, are so totally\r\ndistinct in their past history that it is idle to expect in one or two\r\ngenerations to overcome this difference. One civilization is as old\r\nas the other; and in neither case is the line of cultural descent\r\ncoincident with that of ethnic descent. Unquestionably the ancestors of\r\nthe great majority both of the modern Americans and the modern Japanese\r\nwere barbarians in that remote past which saw the origins of the\r\ncultured peoples to which the Americans and the Japanese of to-day\r\nseverally trace their civilizations. But the lines of development of\r\nthese two civilizations, of the Orient and the Occident, have been\r\nseparate and divergent since thousands of years before the Christian\r\nera; certainly since that hoary eld in which the Akkadian predecessors\r\nof the Chaldean Semites held sway in Mesopotamia. An effort to mix\r\ntogether, out of hand, the peoples representing the culminating points\r\nof two such lines of divergent cultural development would be fraught\r\nwith peril; and this, I repeat, because the two are different, not\r\nbecause either is inferior to the other. Wise statesmen, looking to the\r\nfuture, will for the present endeavor to keep the two nations from mass\r\ncontact and intermingling, precisely because they wish to keep each in\r\nrelations of permanent good will and friendship with the other.\r\n\r\nExactly what was done in the particular crisis to which I refer is shown\r\nin the following letter which, after our policy had been successfully\r\nput into execution, I sent to the then Speaker of the California lower\r\nhouse of the Legislature:\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON, February 8, 1909.\r\n\r\nHON P. A. STANTON, Speaker of the Assembly, Sacramento, California:\r\n\r\nI trust there will be no misunderstanding of the Federal Government's\r\nattitude. We are jealously endeavoring to guard the interests of\r\nCalifornia and of the entire West in accordance with the desires of our\r\nWestern people. By friendly agreement with Japan, we are now carrying\r\nout a policy which, while meeting the interests and desires of the\r\nPacific slope, is yet compatible, not merely with mutual self-respect,\r\nbut with mutual esteem and admiration between the Americans and\r\nJapanese. The Japanese Government is loyally and in good faith doing its\r\npart to carry out this policy, precisely as the American Government\r\nis doing. The policy aims at mutuality of obligation and behavior. In\r\naccordance with it the purpose is that the Japanese shall come here\r\nexactly as Americans go to Japan, which is in effect that travelers,\r\nstudents, persons engaged in international business, men who sojourn for\r\npleasure or study, and the like, shall have the freest access from one\r\ncountry to the other, and shall be sure of the best treatment, but that\r\nthere shall be no settlement in mass by the people of either country in\r\nthe other. During the last six months under this policy more Japanese\r\nhave left the country than have come in, and the total number in the\r\nUnited States has diminished by over two thousand. These figures are\r\nabsolutely accurate and cannot be impeached. In other words, if the\r\npresent policy is consistently followed and works as well in the future\r\nas it is now working, all difficulties and causes of friction\r\nwill disappear, while at the same time each nation will retain its\r\nself-respect and the good will of the other. But such a bill as this\r\nschool bill accomplishes literally nothing whatever in the line of the\r\nobject aimed at, and gives just and grave cause for irritation; while\r\nin addition the United States Government would be obliged immediately to\r\ntake action in the Federal courts to test such legislation, as we hold\r\nit to be clearly a violation of the treaty. On this point I refer you to\r\nthe numerous decisions of the United States Supreme Court in regard to\r\nState laws which violate treaty obligations of the United States. The\r\nlegislation would accomplish nothing beneficial and would certainly\r\ncause some mischief, and might cause very grave mischief. In short, the\r\npolicy of the Administration is to combine the maximum of efficiency in\r\nachieving the real object which the people of the Pacific Slope have at\r\nheart, with the minimum of friction and trouble, while the misguided men\r\nwho advocate such action as this against which I protest are following a\r\npolicy which combines the very minimum of efficiency with the maximum of\r\ninsult, and which, while totally failing to achieve any real result for\r\ngood, yet might accomplish an infinity of harm. If in the next year or\r\ntwo the action of the Federal Government fails to achieve what it is now\r\nachieving, then through the further action of the President and Congress\r\nit can be made entirely efficient. I am sure that the sound judgment of\r\nthe people of California will support you, Mr. Speaker, in your effort.\r\nLet me repeat that at present we are actually doing the very thing which\r\nthe people of California wish to be done, and to upset the arrangement\r\nunder which this is being done cannot do good and may do great harm.\r\nIf in the next year or two the figures of immigration prove that the\r\narrangement which has worked so successfully during the last six months\r\nis no longer working successfully, then there would be ground for\r\ngrievance and for the reversal by the National Government of its present\r\npolicy. But at present the policy is working well, and until it works\r\nbadly it would be a grave misfortune to change it, and when changed it\r\ncan only be changed effectively by the National Government.\r\n\r\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\nIn foreign and domestic affairs alike the policy pursued during my\r\nAdministration was simple. In foreign affairs the principle from which\r\nwe never deviated was to have the Nation behave toward other nations\r\nprecisely as a strong, honorable, and upright man behaves in dealing\r\nwith his fellow-men. There is no such thing as international law in the\r\nsense that there is municipal law or law within a nation. Within the\r\nnation there is always a judge, and a policeman who stands back of the\r\njudge. The whole system of law depends first upon the fact that there is\r\na judge competent to pass judgment, and second upon the fact that there\r\nis some competent officer whose duty it is to carry out this judgment,\r\nby force if necessary. In international law there is no judge, unless\r\nthe parties in interest agree that one shall be constituted; and there\r\nis no policeman to carry out the judge's orders. In consequence, as\r\nyet each nation must depend upon itself for its own protection. The\r\nfrightful calamities that have befallen China, solely because she has\r\nhad no power of self-defense, ought to make it inexcusable in any wise\r\nAmerican citizen to pretend to patriotic purpose, and yet to fail to\r\ninsist that the United States shall keep in a condition of ability if\r\nnecessary to assert its rights with a strong hand. It is folly of the\r\ncriminal type for the Nation not to keep up its navy, not to fortify\r\nits vital strategic points, and not to provide an adequate army for its\r\nneeds. On the other hand, it is wicked for the Nation to fail in either\r\njustice, courtesy, or consideration when dealing with any other power,\r\nbig or little. John Hay was Secretary of State when I became President,\r\nand continued to serve under me until his death, and his and my views\r\nas to the attitude that the Nation should take in foreign affairs were\r\nidentical, both as regards our duty to be able to protect ourselves\r\nagainst the strong and as regards our duty always to act not only justly\r\nbut generously toward the weak.\r\n\r\nJohn Hay was one of the most delightful of companions, one of the most\r\ncharming of all men of cultivation and action. Our views on foreign\r\naffairs coincided absolutely; but, as was natural enough, in domestic\r\nmatters he felt much more conservative than he did in the days when as\r\na young man he was private secretary to the great radical democratic\r\nleader of the '60's, Abraham Lincoln. He was fond of jesting with me\r\nabout my supposedly dangerous tendencies in favor of labor against\r\ncapital. When I was inaugurated on March 4, 1905, I wore a ring he sent\r\nme the evening before, containing the hair of Abraham Lincoln. This ring\r\nwas on my finger when the Chief Justice administered to me the oath of\r\nallegiance to the United States; I often thereafter told John Hay that\r\nwhen I wore such a ring on such an occasion I bound myself more than\r\never to treat the Constitution, after the manner of Abraham Lincoln,\r\nas a document which put human rights above property rights when the\r\ntwo conflicted. The last Christmas John Hay was alive he sent me the\r\nmanuscript of a Norse saga by William Morris, with the following note:\r\n\r\nChristmas Eve, 1904.\r\n\r\nDEAR THEODORE: In your quality of Viking this Norse saga should belong\r\nto you, and in your character of Enemy of Property this Ms. of William\r\nMorris will appeal to you. Wishing you a Merry Christmas and many happy\r\nyears, I am yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nJOHN HAY.\r\n\r\nIn internal affairs I cannot say that I entered the Presidency with any\r\ndeliberately planned and far-reaching scheme of social betterment. I\r\nhad, however, certain strong convictions; and I was on the lookout for\r\nevery opportunity of realizing those convictions. I was bent upon making\r\nthe Government the most efficient possible instrument in helping\r\nthe people of the United States to better themselves in every way,\r\npolitically, socially, and industrially. I believed with all my heart\r\nin real and thoroughgoing democracy, and I wished to make this\r\ndemocracy industrial as well as political, although I had only partially\r\nformulated the methods I believed we should follow. I believed in the\r\npeople's rights, and therefore in National rights and States' rights\r\njust exactly to the degree in which they severally secured popular\r\nrights. I believed in invoking the National power with absolute freedom\r\nfor every National need; and I believed that the Constitution should be\r\ntreated as the greatest document ever devised by the wit of man to aid\r\na people in exercising every power necessary for its own betterment, and\r\nnot as a straitjacket cunningly fashioned to strangle growth. As for the\r\nparticular methods of realizing these various beliefs, I was content\r\nto wait and see what method might be necessary in each given case as it\r\narose; and I was certain that the cases would arise fast enough.\r\n\r\nAs the time for the Presidential nomination of 1904 drew near, it became\r\nevident that I was strong with the rank and file of the party, but that\r\nthere was much opposition to me among many of the big political leaders,\r\nand especially among many of the Wall Street men. A group of these men\r\nmet in conference to organize this opposition. It was to be done with\r\ncomplete secrecy. But such secrets are very hard to keep. I speedily\r\nknew all about it, and took my measures accordingly. The big men in\r\nquestion, who possessed much power so long as they could work under\r\ncover, or so long as they were merely throwing their weight one way or\r\nthe other between forces fairly evenly balanced, were quite helpless\r\nwhen fighting in the open by themselves. I never found out that anything\r\npractical was even attempted by most of the men who took part in the\r\nconference. Three or four of them, however, did attempt something. The\r\nhead of one big business corporation attempted to start an effort to\r\ncontrol the delegations from New Jersey, North Carolina, and certain\r\nGulf States against me. The head of a great railway system made\r\npreparations for a more ambitious effort looking towards the control of\r\nthe delegations from Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, and California\r\nagainst me. He was a very powerful man financially, but his power\r\npolitically was much more limited, and he did not really understand his\r\nown limitations or the situation itself, whereas I did. He could not\r\nhave secured a delegate against me from Iowa, Nebraska, or Kansas. In\r\nColorado and California he could have made a fight, but even there I\r\nthink he would have been completely beaten. However, long before the\r\ntime for the Convention came around, it was recognized that it was\r\nhopeless to make any opposition to my nomination. The effort was\r\nabandoned, and I was nominated unanimously. Judge Parker was nominated\r\nby the Democrats against me. Practically all the metropolitan newspapers\r\nof largest circulation were against me; in New York City fifteen out\r\nof every sixteen copies of papers issued were hostile to me. I won by a\r\npopular majority of about two million and a half, and in the electoral\r\ncollege carried 330 votes against 136. It was by far the largest popular\r\nmajority ever hitherto given any Presidential candidate.\r\n\r\nMy opponents during the campaign had laid much stress upon my supposed\r\npersonal ambition and intention to use the office of President to\r\nperpetuate myself in power. I did not say anything on the subject\r\nprior to the election, as I did not wish to say anything that could be\r\nconstrued into a promise offered as a consideration in order to secure\r\nvotes. But on election night, after the returns were in I issued the\r\nfollowing statement: \"The wise custom which limits the President to two\r\nterms regards the substance and not the form, and under no circumstances\r\nwill I be a candidate for or accept another nomination.\"\r\n\r\nThe reason for my choice of the exact phraseology used was twofold. In\r\nthe first place, many of my supporters were insisting that, as I had\r\nserved only three and a half years of my first term, coming in from the\r\nVice-Presidency when President McKinley was killed, I had really had\r\nonly one elective term, so that the third term custom did not apply to\r\nme; and I wished to repudiate this suggestion. I believed then (and I\r\nbelieve now) the third term custom or tradition to be wholesome, and,\r\ntherefore, I was determined to regard its substance, refusing to quibble\r\nover the words usually employed to express it. On the other hand, I did\r\nnot wish simply and specifically to say that I would not be a candidate\r\nfor the nomination in 1908, because if I had specified the year when I\r\nwould not be a candidate, it would have been widely accepted as meaning\r\nthat I intended to be a candidate some other year; and I had no such\r\nintention, and had no idea that I would ever be a candidate again.\r\nCertain newspaper men did ask me if I intended to apply my prohibition\r\nto 1912, and I answered that I was not thinking of 1912, nor of 1920,\r\nnor of 1940, and that I must decline to say anything whatever except\r\nwhat appeared in my statement.\r\n\r\nThe Presidency is a great office, and the power of the President can be\r\neffectively used to secure a renomination, especially if the President\r\nhas the support of certain great political and financial interests. It\r\nis for this reason, and this reason alone, that the wholesome principle\r\nof continuing in office, so long as he is willing to serve, an incumbent\r\nwho has proved capable, is not applicable to the Presidency. Therefore,\r\nthe American people have wisely established a custom against allowing\r\nany man to hold that office for more than two consecutive terms.\r\nBut every shred of power which a President exercises while in office\r\nvanishes absolutely when he has once left office. An ex-President stands\r\nprecisely in the position of any other private citizen, and has not one\r\nparticle more power to secure a nomination or election than if he had\r\nnever held the office at all--indeed, he probably has less because of\r\nthe very fact that he has held the office. Therefore the reasoning on\r\nwhich the anti-third term custom is based has no application whatever\r\nto an ex-President, and no application whatever to anything except\r\nconsecutive terms. As a barrier of precaution against more than two\r\nconsecutive terms the custom embodies a valuable principle. Applied\r\nin any other way it becomes a mere formula, and like all formulas\r\na potential source of mischievous confusion. Having this in mind, I\r\nregarded the custom as applying practically, if not just as much, to a\r\nPresident who had been seven and a half years in office as to one\r\nwho had been eight years in office, and therefore, in the teeth of a\r\npractically unanimous demand from my own party that I accept another\r\nnomination, and the reasonable certainty that the nomination would be\r\nratified at the polls, I felt that the substance of the custom applied\r\nto me in 1908. On the other hand, it had no application whatever to any\r\nhuman being save where it was invoked in the case of a man desiring a\r\nthird consecutive term. Having given such substantial proof of my own\r\nregard for the custom, I deem it a duty to add this comment on it. I\r\nbelieve that it is well to have a custom of this kind, to be generally\r\nobserved, but that it would be very unwise to have it definitely\r\nhardened into a Constitutional prohibition. It is not desirable\r\nordinarily that a man should stay in office twelve consecutive years as\r\nPresident; but most certainly the American people are fit to take care\r\nof themselves, and stand in no need of an irrevocable self-denying\r\nordinance. They should not bind themselves never to take action which\r\nunder some quite conceivable circumstances it might be to their great\r\ninterest to take. It is obviously of the last importance to the safety\r\nof a democracy that in time of real peril it should be able to command\r\nthe service of every one among its citizens in the precise position\r\nwhere the service rendered will be most valuable. It would be a\r\nbenighted policy in such event to disqualify absolutely from the\r\nhighest office a man who while holding it had actually shown the highest\r\ncapacity to exercise its powers with the utmost effect for the public\r\ndefense. If, for instance, a tremendous crisis occurred at the end of\r\nthe second term of a man like Lincoln, as such a crisis occurred at the\r\nend of his first term, it would be a veritable calamity if the American\r\npeople were forbidden to continue to use the services of the one man\r\nwhom they knew, and did not merely guess, could carry them through the\r\ncrisis. The third term tradition has no value whatever except as it\r\napplies to a third consecutive term. While it is well to keep it as\r\na custom, it would be a mark both of weakness and unwisdom for the\r\nAmerican people to embody it into a Constitutional provision which could\r\nnot do them good and on some given occasion might work real harm.\r\n\r\nThere was one cartoon made while I was President, in which I appeared\r\nincidentally, that was always a great favorite of mine. It pictured an\r\nold fellow with chin whiskers, a farmer, in his shirt-sleeves, with his\r\nboots off, sitting before the fire, reading the President's Message. On\r\nhis feet were stockings of the kind I have seen hung up by the dozen in\r\nJoe Ferris's store at Medora, in the days when I used to come in to town\r\nand sleep in one of the rooms over the store. The title of the picture\r\nwas \"His Favorite Author.\" This was the old fellow whom I always used to\r\nkeep in mind. He had probably been in the Civil War in his youth; he had\r\nworked hard ever since he left the army; he had been a good husband and\r\nfather; he had brought up his boys and girls to work; he did not wish to\r\ndo injustice to any one else, but he wanted justice done to himself and\r\nto others like him; and I was bound to secure that justice for him if it\r\nlay in my power to do so.[*]\r\n\r\n[*] I believe I realized fairly well this ambition. I shall turn to\r\nmy enemies to attest the truth of this statement. The New York _Sun_,\r\nshortly before the National Convention of 1904, spoke of me as follows:\r\n\r\n\"President Roosevelt holds that his nomination by the National\r\nRepublican Convention of 1904 is an assured thing. He makes no\r\nconcealment of his conviction, and it is unreservedly shared by his\r\nfriends. We think President Roosevelt is right.\r\n\r\n\"There are strong and convincing reasons why the President should feel\r\nthat success is within his grasp. He has used the opportunities that\r\nhe found or created, and he has used them with consummate skill and\r\nundeniable success.\r\n\r\n\"The President has disarmed all his enemies. Every weapon they had,\r\nnew or old, has been taken from them and added to the now unassailable\r\nRoosevelt arsenal. Why should people wonder that Mr. Bryan clings to\r\nsilver? Has not Mr. Roosevelt absorbed and sequestered every vestige of\r\nthe Kansas City platform that had a shred of practical value?\r\nSuppose that Mr. Bryan had been elected President. What could he have\r\naccomplished compared with what Mr. Roosevelt has accomplished? Will his\r\nmost passionate followers pretend for one moment that Mr. Bryan could\r\nhave conceived, much less enforced, any such pursuit of the trusts as\r\nthat which Mr. Roosevelt has just brought to a triumphant issue? Will\r\nMr. Bryan himself intimate that the Federal courts would have turned to\r\nhis projects the friendly countenance which they have lent to those of\r\nMr. Roosevelt?\r\n\r\n\"Where is 'government by injunction' gone to? The very emptiness of that\r\nonce potent phrase is beyond description! A regiment of Bryans could not\r\ncompete with Mr. Roosevelt in harrying the trusts, in bringing wealth to\r\nits knees, and in converting into the palpable actualities of action the\r\nwildest dreams of Bryan's campaign orators. He has outdone them all.\r\n\r\n\"And how utterly the President has routed the pretensions of Bryan, and\r\nof the whole Democratic horde in respect to organized labor! How empty\r\nwere all their professions, their mouthings and their howlings in the\r\nface of the simple and unpretentious achievements of the President! In\r\nhis own straightforward fashion he inflicted upon capital in one short\r\nhour of the coal strike a greater humiliation than Bryan could have\r\nvisited upon it in a century. He is the leader of the labor unions of\r\nthe United States. Mr. Roosevelt has put them above the law and above\r\nthe Constitution, because for him they are the American people.\" [This\r\nlast, I need hardly say, is merely a rhetorical method of saying that I\r\ngave the labor union precisely the same treatment as the corporation.]\r\n\r\nSenator La Follette, in the issue of his magazine immediately following\r\nmy leaving the Presidency in March, 1909, wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Roosevelt steps from the stage gracefully. He has ruled his party to a\r\nlarge extent against its will. He has played a large part in the\r\nworld's work, for the past seven years. The activities of his remarkably\r\nforceful personality have been so manifold that it will be long before\r\nhis true rating will be fixed in the opinion of the race. He is said to\r\nthink that the three great things done by him are the undertaking of the\r\nconstruction of the Panama Canal and its rapid and successful carrying\r\nforward, the making of peace between Russia and Japan, and the sending\r\naround the world of the fleet.\r\n\r\n\"These are important things, but many will be slow to think them his\r\ngreatest services. The Panama Canal will surely serve mankind when in\r\noperation; and the manner of organizing this work seems to be fine.\r\nBut no one can say whether this project will be a gigantic success or\r\na gigantic failure; and the task is one which must, in the nature of\r\nthings, have been undertaken and carried through some time soon, as\r\nhistoric periods go, anyhow. The Peace of Portsmouth was a great thing\r\nto be responsible for, and Roosevelt's good offices undoubtedly saved\r\na great and bloody battle in Manchuria. But the war was fought out, and\r\nthe parties ready to quit, and there is reason to think that it was\r\nonly when this situation was arrived at that the good offices of the\r\nPresident of the United States were, more or less indirectly, invited.\r\nThe fleet's cruise was a strong piece of diplomacy, by which we informed\r\nJapan that we will send our fleet wherever we please and whenever we\r\nplease. It worked out well.\r\n\r\n\"But none of these things, it will seem to many, can compare with some\r\nof Roosevelt's other achievements. Perhaps he is loath to take credit as\r\na reformer, for he is prone to spell the word with question marks, and\r\nto speak disparagingly of 'reform.'\r\n\r\n\"But for all that, this contemner of 'reformers' made reform respectable\r\nin the United States, and this rebuker of 'muck-rakers' has been the\r\nchief agent in making the history of 'muck-raking' in the United States\r\na National one, conceded to be useful. He has preached from the White\r\nHouse many doctrines; but among them he has left impressed on the\r\nAmerican mind the one great truth of economic justice couched in the\r\npithy and stinging phrase 'the square deal.' The task of making reform\r\nrespectable in a commercialized world, and of giving the Nation a slogan\r\nin a phrase, is greater than the man who performed it is likely to\r\nthink.\r\n\r\n\"And, then, there is the great and statesmanlike movement for the\r\nconservation of our National resources, into which Roosevelt so\r\nenergetically threw himself at a time when the Nation as a whole knew\r\nnot that we are ruining and bankrupting ourselves as fast as we can.\r\nThis is probably the greatest thing Roosevelt did, undoubtedly. This\r\nglobe is the capital stock of the race. It is just so much coal and oil\r\nand gas. This may be economized or wasted. The same thing is true of\r\nphosphates and other mineral resources. Our water resources are immense,\r\nand we are only just beginning to use them. Our forests have been\r\ndestroyed; they must be restored. Our soils are being depleted; they\r\nmust be built up and conserved.\r\n\r\n\"These questions are not of this day only or of this generation. They\r\nbelong all to the future. Their consideration requires that high moral\r\ntone which regards the earth as the home of a posterity to whom we owe a\r\nsacred duty.\r\n\r\n\"This immense idea Roosevelt, with high statesmanship, dinned into the\r\nears of the Nation until the Nation heeded. He held it so high that it\r\nattracted the attention of the neighboring nations of the continent,\r\nand will so spread and intensify that we will soon see the world's\r\nconferences devoted to it.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing can be greater or finer than this. It is so great and so fine\r\nthat when the historian of the future shall speak of Theodore Roosevelt\r\nhe is likely to say that he did many notable things, among them that of\r\ninaugurating the movement which finally resulted in the square deal,\r\nbut that his greatest work was inspiring and actually beginning a world\r\nmovement for staying terrestrial waste and saving for the human race\r\nthe things upon which, and upon which alone, a great and peaceful and\r\nprogressive and happy race life can be founded.\r\n\r\n\"What statesman in all history has done anything calling for so wide a\r\nview and for a purpose more lofty?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE NATURAL RESOURCES OF THE NATION\r\n\r\nWhen Governor of New York, as I have already described, I had been in\r\nconsultation with Gifford Pinchot and F. H. Newell, and had shaped\r\nmy recommendations about forestry largely in accordance with their\r\nsuggestions. Like other men who had thought about the national future at\r\nall, I had been growing more and more concerned over the destruction of\r\nthe forests.\r\n\r\nWhile I had lived in the West I had come to realize the vital need of\r\nirrigation to the country, and I had been both amused and irritated\r\nby the attitude of Eastern men who obtained from Congress grants of\r\nNational money to develop harbors and yet fought the use of the Nation's\r\npower to develop the irrigation work of the West. Major John Wesley\r\nPowell, the explorer of the Grand Canyon, and Director of the Geological\r\nSurvey, was the first man who fought for irrigation, and he lived to see\r\nthe Reclamation Act passed and construction actually begun. Mr. F. H.\r\nNewell, the present Director of the Reclamation Service, began his\r\nwork as an assistant hydraulic engineer under Major Powell; and, unlike\r\nPowell, he appreciated the need of saving the forests and the soil\r\nas well as the need of irrigation. Between Powell and Newell came, as\r\nDirector of the Geological Survey, Charles D. Walcott, who, after\r\nthe Reclamation Act was passed, by his force, pertinacity, and tact,\r\nsucceeded in putting the act into effect in the best possible manner.\r\nSenator Francis G. Newlands, of Nevada, fought hard for the cause of\r\nreclamation in Congress. He attempted to get his State to act, and when\r\nthat proved hopeless to get the Nation to act; and was ably assisted\r\nby Mr. G. H. Maxwell, a Californian, who had taken a deep interest in\r\nirrigation matters. Dr. W. J. McGee was one of the leaders in all the\r\nlater stages of the movement. But Gifford Pinchot is the man to whom\r\nthe nation owes most for what has been accomplished as regards the\r\npreservation of the natural resources of our country. He led, and indeed\r\nduring its most vital period embodied, the fight for the preservation\r\nthrough use of our forests. He played one of the leading parts in\r\nthe effort to make the National Government the chief instrument in\r\ndeveloping the irrigation of the arid West. He was the foremost leader\r\nin the great struggle to coordinate all our social and governmental\r\nforces in the effort to secure the adoption of a rational and farseeing\r\npolicy for securing the conservation of all our national resources. He\r\nwas already in the Government service as head of the Forestry Bureau\r\nwhen I became President; he continued throughout my term, not only as\r\nhead of the Forest service, but as the moving and directing spirit in\r\nmost of the conservation work, and as counsellor and assistant on most\r\nof the other work connected with the internal affairs of the country.\r\nTaking into account the varied nature of the work he did, its vital\r\nimportance to the nation and the fact that as regards much of it he\r\nwas practically breaking new ground, and taking into account also\r\nhis tireless energy and activity, his fearlessness, his complete\r\ndisinterestedness, his single-minded devotion to the interests of the\r\nplain people, and his extraordinary efficiency, I believe it is but\r\njust to say that among the many, many public officials who under my\r\nadministration rendered literally invaluable service to the people of\r\nthe United States, he, on the whole, stood first. A few months after I\r\nleft the Presidency he was removed from office by President Taft.\r\n\r\nThe first work I took up when I became President was the work of\r\nreclamation. Immediately after I had come to Washington, after the\r\nassassination of President McKinley, while staying at the house of\r\nmy sister, Mrs. Cowles, before going into the White House, Newell and\r\nPinchot called upon me and laid before me their plans for National\r\nirrigation of the arid lands of the West, and for the consolidation of\r\nthe forest work of the Government in the Bureau of Forestry.\r\n\r\nAt that time a narrowly legalistic point of view toward natural\r\nresources obtained in the Departments, and controlled the Governmental\r\nadministrative machinery. Through the General Land Office and other\r\nGovernment bureaus, the public resources were being handled and\r\ndisposed of in accordance with the small considerations of petty\r\nlegal formalities, instead of for the large purposes of constructive\r\ndevelopment, and the habit of deciding, whenever possible, in favor of\r\nprivate interests against the public welfare was firmly fixed. It was\r\nas little customary to favor the bona-fide settler and home builder, as\r\nagainst the strict construction of the law, as it was to use the law in\r\nthwarting the operations of the land grabbers. A technical compliance\r\nwith the letter of the law was all that was required.\r\n\r\nThe idea that our natural resources were inexhaustible still obtained,\r\nand there was as yet no real knowledge of their extent and condition.\r\nThe relation of the conservation of natural resources to the problems\r\nof National welfare and National efficiency had not yet dawned on the\r\npublic mind. The reclamation of arid public lands in the West was still\r\na matter for private enterprise alone; and our magnificent river system,\r\nwith its superb possibilities for public usefulness, was dealt with by\r\nthe National Government not as a unit, but as a disconnected series of\r\npork-barrel problems, whose only real interest was in their effect\r\non the reelection or defeat of a Congressman here and there--a theory\r\nwhich, I regret to say, still obtains.\r\n\r\nThe place of the farmer in the National economy was still regarded\r\nsolely as that of a grower of food to be eaten by others, while the\r\nhuman needs and interests of himself and his wife and children still\r\nremained wholly outside the recognition of the Government.\r\n\r\nAll the forests which belonged to the United States were held and\r\nadministered in one Department, and all the foresters in Government\r\nemploy were in another Department. Forests and foresters had nothing\r\nwhatever to do with each other. The National Forests in the West (then\r\ncalled forest reserves) were wholly inadequate in area to meet the\r\npurposes for which they were created, while the need for forest\r\nprotection in the East had not yet begun to enter the public mind.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of things when Newell and Pinchot called on me. I\r\nwas a warm believer in reclamation and in forestry, and, after listening\r\nto my two guests, I asked them to prepare material on the subject for\r\nme to use in my first message to Congress, of December 3, 1901. This\r\nmessage laid the foundation for the development of irrigation and\r\nforestry during the next seven and one-half years. It set forth the\r\nnew attitude toward the natural resources in the words: \"The Forest\r\nand water problems are perhaps the most vital internal problems of the\r\nUnited States.\"\r\n\r\nOn the day the message was read, a committee of Western Senators and\r\nCongressmen was organized to prepare a Reclamation Bill in accordance\r\nwith the recommendations. By far the most effective of the Senators\r\nin drafting and pushing the bill, which became known by his name, was\r\nNewlands. The draft of the bill was worked over by me and others at\r\nseveral conferences and revised in important particulars; my active\r\ninterference was necessary to prevent it from being made unworkable by\r\nan undue insistence upon States Rights, in accordance with the efforts\r\nof Mr. Mondell and other Congressmen, who consistently fought for local\r\nand private interests as against the interests of the people as a whole.\r\n\r\nOn June 17, 1902, the Reclamation Act was passed. It set aside the\r\nproceeds of the disposal of public lands for the purpose of reclaiming\r\nthe waste areas of the arid West by irrigating lands otherwise\r\nworthless, and thus creating new homes upon the land. The money so\r\nappropriated was to be repaid to the Government by the settlers, and to\r\nbe used again as a revolving fund continuously available for the work.\r\n\r\nThe impatience of the Western people to see immediate results from the\r\nReclamation Act was so great that red tape was disregarded, and the work\r\nwas pushed forward at a rate previously unknown in Government affairs.\r\nLater, as in almost all such cases, there followed the criticisms of\r\nalleged illegality and haste which are so easy to make after results\r\nhave been accomplished and the need for the measures without which\r\nnothing could have been done has gone by. These criticisms were in\r\ncharacter precisely the same as that made about the acquisition of\r\nPanama, the settlement of the anthracite coal strike, the suits against\r\nthe big trusts, the stopping of the panic of 1907 by the action of the\r\nExecutive concerning the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company; and, in short,\r\nabout most of the best work done during my administration.\r\n\r\nWith the Reclamation work, as with much other work under me, the men\r\nin charge were given to understand that they must get into the water if\r\nthey would learn to swim; and, furthermore, they learned to know that if\r\nthey acted honestly, and boldly and fearlessly accepted responsibility,\r\nI would stand by them to the limit. In this, as in every other case, in\r\nthe end the boldness of the action fully justified itself.\r\n\r\nEvery item of the whole great plan of Reclamation now in effect was\r\nundertaken between 1902 and 1906. By the spring of 1909 the work was an\r\nassured success, and the Government had become fully committed to its\r\ncontinuance. The work of Reclamation was at first under the United\r\nStates Geological Survey, of which Charles D. Walcott was at that time\r\nDirector. In the spring of 1908 the United States Reclamation Service\r\nwas established to carry it on, under the direction of Frederick\r\nHayes Newell, to whom the inception of the plan was due. Newell's\r\nsingle-minded devotion to this great task, the constructive imagination\r\nwhich enabled him to conceive it, and the executive power and high\r\ncharacter through which he and his assistant, Arthur P. Davis, built\r\nup a model service--all these have made him a model servant. The final\r\nproof of his merit is supplied by the character and records of the men\r\nwho later assailed him.\r\n\r\nAlthough the gross expenditure under the Reclamation Act is not yet\r\nas large as that for the Panama Canal, the engineering obstacles to be\r\novercome have been almost as great, and the political impediments many\r\ntimes greater. The Reclamation work had to be carried on at widely\r\nseparated points, remote from railroads, under the most difficult\r\npioneer conditions. The twenty-eight projects begun in the years 1902\r\nto 1906 contemplated the irrigation of more than three million acres\r\nand the watering of more than thirty thousand farms. Many of the\r\ndams required for this huge task are higher than any previously built\r\nanywhere in the world. They feed main-line canals over seven thousand\r\nmiles in total length, and involve minor constructions, such as culverts\r\nand bridges, tens of thousands in number.\r\n\r\nWhat the Reclamation Act has done for the country is by no means limited\r\nto its material accomplishment. This Act and the results flowing from it\r\nhave helped powerfully to prove to the Nation that it can handle its own\r\nresources and exercise direct and business-like control over them. The\r\npopulation which the Reclamation Act has brought into the arid West,\r\nwhile comparatively small when compared with that in the more closely\r\ninhabited East, has been a most effective contribution to the National\r\nlife, for it has gone far to transform the social aspect of the West,\r\nmaking for the stability of the institutions upon which the welfare of\r\nthe whole country rests: it has substituted actual homemakers, who have\r\nsettled on the land with their families, for huge, migratory bands of\r\nsheep herded by the hired shepherds of absentee owners.\r\n\r\nThe recent attacks on the Reclamation Service, and on Mr. Newell, arise\r\nin large part, if not altogether, from an organized effort to repudiate\r\nthe obligation of the settlers to repay the Government for what it has\r\nexpended to reclaim the land. The repudiation of any debt can always\r\nfind supporters, and in this case it has attracted the support not only\r\nof certain men among the settlers who hope to be relieved of paying what\r\nthey owe, but also of a variety of unscrupulous politicians, some highly\r\nplaced. It is unlikely that their efforts to deprive the West of\r\nthe revolving Irrigation fund will succeed in doing anything but\r\ndiscrediting these politicians in the sight of all honest men.\r\n\r\nWhen in the spring of 1911 I visited the Roosevelt Dam in Arizona, and\r\nopened the reservoir, I made a short speech to the assembled people.\r\nAmong other things, I said to the engineers present that in the name of\r\nall good citizens I thanked them for their admirable work, as efficient\r\nas it was honest, and conducted according to the highest standards of\r\npublic service. As I looked at the fine, strong, eager faces of those\r\nof the force who were present, and thought of the similar men in the\r\nservice, in the higher positions, who were absent, and who were no less\r\nresponsible for the work done, I felt a foreboding that they would\r\nnever receive any real recognition for their achievement; and, only half\r\nhumorously, I warned them not to expect any credit, or any satisfaction,\r\nexcept their own knowledge that they had done well a first-class job,\r\nfor that probably the only attention Congress would ever pay them would\r\nbe to investigate them. Well, a year later a Congressional Committee\r\nactually did investigate them. The investigation was instigated by some\r\nunscrupulous local politicians and by some settlers who wished to be\r\nrelieved from paying their just obligations; and the members of the\r\nCommittee joined in the attack on as fine and honorable a set of public\r\nservants as the Government has ever had; an attack made on them solely\r\nbecause they were honorable and efficient and loyal to the interests\r\nboth of the Government and the settlers.\r\n\r\nWhen I became President, the Bureau of Forestry (since 1905 the United\r\nStates Forest Service) was a small but growing organization, under\r\nGifford Pinchot, occupied mainly with laying the foundation of American\r\nforestry by scientific study of the forests, and with the promotion of\r\nforestry on private lands. It contained all the trained foresters in the\r\nGovernment service, but had charge of no public timberland whatsoever.\r\nThe Government forest reserves of that day were in the care of a\r\nDivision in the General Land Office, under the management of clerks\r\nwholly without knowledge of forestry, few if any of whom had ever seen\r\na foot of the timberlands for which they were responsible. Thus the\r\nreserves were neither well protected nor well used. There were no\r\nforesters among the men who had charge of the National Forests, and no\r\nGovernment forests in charge of the Government foresters.\r\n\r\nIn my first message to Congress I strongly recommended the consolidation\r\nof the forest work in the hands of the trained men of the Bureau of\r\nForestry. This recommendation was repeated in other messages, but\r\nCongress did not give effect to it until three years later. In the\r\nmeantime, by thorough study of the Western public timberlands, the\r\ngroundwork was laid for the responsibilities which were to fall upon\r\nthe Bureau of Forestry when the care of the National Forests came to be\r\ntransferred to it. It was evident that trained American Foresters would\r\nbe needed in considerable numbers, and a forest school was established\r\nat Yale to supply them.\r\n\r\nIn 1901, at my suggestion as President, the Secretary of the Interior,\r\nMr. Hitchcock, made a formal request for technical advice from the\r\nBureau of Forestry in handling the National Forests, and an extensive\r\nexamination of their condition and needs was accordingly taken up. The\r\nsame year a study was begun of the proposed Appalachian National Forest,\r\nthe plan of which, already formulated at that time, has since been\r\ncarried out. A year later experimental planting on the National Forests\r\nwas also begun, and studies preparatory to the application of practical\r\nforestry to the Indian Reservations were undertaken. In 1903, so\r\nrapidly did the public work of the Bureau of Forestry increase, that the\r\nexamination of land for new forest reserves was added to the study\r\nof those already created, the forest lands of the various States were\r\nstudied, and cooperation with several of them in the examination and\r\nhandling of their forest lands was undertaken. While these practical\r\ntasks were pushed forward, a technical knowledge of American Forests\r\nwas rapidly accumulated. The special knowledge gained was made public\r\nin printed bulletins; and at the same time the Bureau undertook, through\r\nthe newspaper and periodical press, to make all the people of the United\r\nStates acquainted with the needs and the purposes of practical\r\nforestry. It is doubtful whether there has ever been elsewhere under the\r\nGovernment such effective publicity--publicity purely in the interest of\r\nthe people--at so low a cost. Before the educational work of the Forest\r\nService was stopped by the Taft Administration, it was securing\r\nthe publication of facts about forestry in fifty million copies of\r\nnewspapers a month at a total expense of $6000 a year. Not one cent has\r\never been paid by the Forest Service to any publication of any kind for\r\nthe printing of this material. It was given out freely, and published\r\nwithout cost because it was news. Without this publicity the Forest\r\nService could not have survived the attacks made upon it by the\r\nrepresentatives of the great special interests in Congress; nor could\r\nforestry in America have made the rapid progress it has.\r\n\r\nThe result of all the work outlined above was to bring together in the\r\nBureau of Forestry, by the end of 1904, the only body of forest experts\r\nunder the Government, and practically all of the first-hand information\r\nabout the public forests which was then in existence. In 1905, the\r\nobvious foolishness of continuing to separate the foresters and the\r\nforests, reenforced by the action of the First National Forest Congress,\r\nheld in Washington, brought about the Act of February 1, 1905,\r\nwhich transferred the National Forests from the care of the Interior\r\nDepartment to the Department of Agriculture, and resulted in the\r\ncreation of the present United States Forest Service.\r\n\r\nThe men upon whom the responsibility of handling some sixty million\r\nacres of National Forest lands was thus thrown were ready for the work,\r\nboth in the office and in the field, because they had been preparing\r\nfor it for more than five years. Without delay they proceeded, under the\r\nleadership of Pinchot, to apply to the new work the principles they had\r\nalready formulated. One of these was to open all the resources of the\r\nNational Forests to regulated use. Another was that of putting every\r\npart of the land to that use in which it would best serve the public.\r\nFollowing this principle, the Act of June 11, 1906, was drawn, and its\r\npassage was secured from Congress. This law throws open to settlement\r\nall land in the National Forests that is found, on examination, to be\r\nchiefly valuable for agriculture. Hitherto all such land had been closed\r\nto the settler.\r\n\r\nThe principles thus formulated and applied may be summed up in the\r\nstatement that the rights of the public to the natural resources\r\noutweigh private rights, and must be given its first consideration.\r\nUntil that time, in dealing with the National Forests, and the public\r\nlands generally, private rights had almost uniformly been allowed to\r\noverbalance public rights. The change we made was right, and was vitally\r\nnecessary; but, of course, it created bitter opposition from private\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nOne of the principles whose application was the source of much hostility\r\nwas this: It is better for the Government to help a poor man to make a\r\nliving for his family than to help a rich man make more profit for his\r\ncompany. This principle was too sound to be fought openly. It is the\r\nkind of principle to which politicians delight to pay unctuous homage in\r\nwords. But we translated the words into deeds; and when they found that\r\nthis was the case, many rich men, especially sheep owners, were stirred\r\nto hostility, and they used the Congressmen they controlled to assault\r\nus--getting most aid from certain demagogues, who were equally glad\r\nimproperly to denounce rich men in public and improperly to serve them\r\nin private. The Forest Service established and enforced regulations\r\nwhich favored the settler as against the large stock owner; required\r\nthat necessary reductions in the stock grazed on any National Forest\r\nshould bear first on the big man, before the few head of the small man,\r\nupon which the living of his family depended, were reduced; and made\r\ngrazing in the National Forests a help, instead of a hindrance, to\r\npermanent settlement. As a result, the small settlers and their families\r\nbecame, on the whole, the best friends the Forest Service has; although\r\nin places their ignorance was played on by demagogues to influence them\r\nagainst the policy that was primarily for their own interest.\r\n\r\nAnother principle which led to the bitterest antagonism of all was\r\nthis--whoever (except a bona-fide settler) takes public property for\r\nprivate profit should pay for what he gets. In the effort to apply\r\nthis principle, the Forest Service obtained a decision from the\r\nAttorney-General that it was legal to make the men who grazed sheep and\r\ncattle on the National Forests pay for what they got. Accordingly, in\r\nthe summer of 1906, for the first time, such a charge was made; and, in\r\nthe face of the bitterest opposition, it was collected.\r\n\r\nUp to the time the National Forests were put under the charge of the\r\nForest Service, the Interior Department had made no effort to establish\r\npublic regulation and control of water powers. Upon the transfer, the\r\nService immediately began its fight to handle the power resources of the\r\nNational Forests so as to prevent speculation and monopoly and to yield\r\na fair return to the Government. On May 1, 1906, an Act was passed\r\ngranting the use of certain power sites in Southern California to the\r\nEdison Electric Power Company, which Act, at the suggestion of the\r\nService, limited the period of the permit to forty years, and required\r\nthe payment of an annual rental by the company, the same conditions\r\nwhich were thereafter adopted by the Service as the basis for all\r\npermits for power development. Then began a vigorous fight against\r\nthe position of the Service by the water-power interests. The right\r\nto charge for water-power development was, however, sustained by the\r\nAttorney-General.\r\n\r\nIn 1907, the area of the National Forests was increased by Presidential\r\nproclamation more than forty-three million acres; the plant necessary\r\nfor the full use of the Forests, such as roads, trails, and telephone\r\nlines, began to be provided on a large scale; the interchange of field\r\nand office men, so as to prevent the antagonism between them, which is\r\nso destructive of efficiency in most great businesses, was established\r\nas a permanent policy; and the really effective management of the\r\nenormous area of the National Forests began to be secured.\r\n\r\nWith all this activity in the field, the progress of technical forestry\r\nand popular education was not neglected. In 1907, for example, sixty-one\r\npublications on various phases of forestry, with a total of more than a\r\nmillion copies, were issued, as against three publications, with a\r\ntotal of eighty-two thousand copies, in 1901. By this time, also, the\r\nopposition of the servants of the special interests in Congress to the\r\nForest Service had become strongly developed, and more time appeared\r\nto be spent in the yearly attacks upon it during the passage of the\r\nappropriation bills than on all other Government Bureaus put together.\r\nEvery year the Forest Service had to fight for its life.\r\n\r\nOne incident in these attacks is worth recording. While the Agricultural\r\nAppropriation Bill was passing through the Senate, in 1907, Senator\r\nFulton, of Oregon, secured an amendment providing that the President\r\ncould not set aside any additional National Forests in the six\r\nNorthwestern States. This meant retaining some sixteen million of acres\r\nto be exploited by land grabbers and by the representatives of the great\r\nspecial interests, at the expense of the public interest. But for four\r\nyears the Forest Service had been gathering field notes as to what\r\nforests ought to be set aside in these States, and so was prepared to\r\nact. It was equally undesirable to veto the whole agricultural bill, and\r\nto sign it with this amendment effective. Accordingly, a plan to create\r\nthe necessary National Forest in these States before the Agricultural\r\nBill could be passed and signed was laid before me by Mr. Pinchot. I\r\napproved it. The necessary papers were immediately prepared. I signed\r\nthe last proclamation a couple of days before, by my signature, the bill\r\nbecame law; and, when the friends of the special interests in the Senate\r\ngot their amendment through and woke up, they discovered that sixteen\r\nmillion acres of timberland had been saved for the people by putting\r\nthem in the National Forests before the land grabbers could get at them.\r\nThe opponents of the Forest Service turned handsprings in their wrath;\r\nand dire were their threats against the Executive; but the threats could\r\nnot be carried out, and were really only a tribute to the efficiency of\r\nour action.\r\n\r\nBy 1908, the fire prevention work of the Forest Service had become so\r\nsuccessful that eighty-six per cent of the fires that did occur were\r\nheld down to an area of five acres or less, and the timber sales, which\r\nyielded $60,000 in 1905, in 1908 produced $850,000. In the same year, in\r\naddition to the work of the National Forests, the responsibility for the\r\nproper handling of Indian timberlands was laid upon the Forest Service,\r\nwhere it remained with great benefit to the Indians until it was\r\nwithdrawn, as a part of the attack on the Conservation policy made after\r\nI left office.\r\n\r\nBy March 4, 1909, nearly half a million acres of agricultural land in\r\nthe National Forests had been opened to settlement under the Act of\r\nJune 11, 1906. The business management of the Forest Service became so\r\nexcellent, thanks to the remarkable executive capacity of the Associate\r\nForester, Overton W. Price (removed after I left office), that it\r\nwas declared by a well-known firm of business organizers to compare\r\nfavorably with the best managed of the great private corporations,\r\nan opinion which was confirmed by the report of a Congressional\r\ninvestigation, and by the report of the Presidential Committee on\r\nDepartment method. The area of the National Forests had increased from\r\n43 to 194 million acres; the force from about 500 to more than 3000.\r\nThere was saved for public use in the National Forests more Government\r\ntimberland during the seven and a half years prior to March 4, 1909,\r\nthan during all previous and succeeding years put together.\r\n\r\nThe idea that the Executive is the steward of the public welfare was\r\nfirst formulated and given practical effect in the Forest Service by its\r\nlaw officer, George Woodruff. The laws were often insufficient, and it\r\nbecame well-nigh impossible to get them amended in the public interest\r\nwhen once the representatives of privilege in Congress grasped the fact\r\nthat I would sign no amendment that contained anything not in the public\r\ninterest. It was necessary to use what law was already in existence,\r\nand then further to supplement it by Executive action. The practice\r\nof examining every claim to public land before passing it into private\r\nownership offers a good example of the policy in question. This\r\npractice, which has since become general, was first applied in the\r\nNational Forests. Enormous areas of valuable public timberland were\r\nthereby saved from fraudulent acquisition; more than 250,000 acres were\r\nthus saved in a single case.\r\n\r\nThis theory of stewardship in the interest of the public was well\r\nillustrated by the establishment of a water-power policy. Until the\r\nForest Service changed the plan, water-powers on the navigable streams,\r\non the public domain, and in the National Forests were given away for\r\nnothing, and substantially without question, to whoever asked for them.\r\nAt last, under the principle that public property should be paid for\r\nand should not be permanently granted away when such permanent grant is\r\navoidable, the Forest Service established the policy of regulating the\r\nuse of power in the National Forests in the public interest and making\r\na charge for value received. This was the beginning of the water-power\r\npolicy now substantially accepted by the public, and doubtless soon to\r\nbe enacted into law. But there was at the outset violent opposition to\r\nit on the part of the water-power companies, and such representatives of\r\ntheir views in Congress as Messrs. Tawney and Bede.\r\n\r\nMany bills were introduced in Congress aimed, in one way or another, at\r\nrelieving the power companies of control and payment. When these bills\r\nreached me I refused to sign them; and the injury to the public interest\r\nwhich would follow their passage was brought sharply to public attention\r\nin my message of February 26, 1908. The bills made no further progress.\r\n\r\nUnder the same principle of stewardship, railroads and other\r\ncorporations, which applied for and were given rights in the National\r\nForests, were regulated in the use of those rights. In short, the public\r\nresources in charge of the Forest Service were handled frankly and\r\nopenly for the public welfare under the clear-cut and clearly set forth\r\nprinciple that the public rights come first and private interest second.\r\n\r\nThe natural result of this new attitude was the assertion in every form\r\nby the representatives of special interests that the Forest Service\r\nwas exceeding its legal powers and thwarting the intention of Congress.\r\nSuits were begun wherever the chance arose. It is worth recording that,\r\nin spite of the novelty and complexity of the legal questions it had\r\nto face, no court of last resort has ever decided against the Forest\r\nService. This statement includes two unanimous decisions by the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States (U. S. vs. Grimaud, 220 U. S., 506, and Light\r\nvs. U. S., 220 U. S., 523).\r\n\r\nIn its administration of the National Forests, the Forest Service\r\nfound that valuable coal lands were in danger of passing into private\r\nownership without adequate money return to the Government and\r\nwithout safeguard against monopoly; and that existing legislation was\r\ninsufficient to prevent this. When this condition was brought to my\r\nattention I withdrew from all forms of entry about sixty-eight million\r\nacres of coal land in the United States, including Alaska. The refusal\r\nof Congress to act in the public interest was solely responsible for\r\nkeeping these lands from entry.\r\n\r\nThe Conservation movement was a direct outgrowth of the forest movement.\r\nIt was nothing more than the application to our other natural resources\r\nof the principles which had been worked out in connection with the\r\nforests. Without the basis of public sentiment which had been built up\r\nfor the protection of the forests, and without the example of public\r\nforesight in the protection of this, one of the great natural resources,\r\nthe Conservation movement would have been impossible. The first formal\r\nstep was the creation of the Inland Waterways Commission, appointed\r\non March 14, 1907. In my letter appointing the Commission, I called\r\nattention to the value of our streams as great natural resources, and to\r\nthe need for a progressive plan for their development and control, and\r\nsaid: \"It is not possible to properly frame so large a plan as this\r\nfor the control of our rivers without taking account of the orderly\r\ndevelopment of other natural resources. Therefore I ask that the Inland\r\nWaterways Commission shall consider the relations of the streams to the\r\nuse of all the great permanent natural resources and their conservation\r\nfor the making and maintenance of prosperous homes.\"\r\n\r\nOver a year later, writing on the report of the Commission, I said:\r\n\r\n\"The preliminary Report of the Inland Waterways Commission was excellent\r\nin every way. It outlines a general plan of waterway improvement which\r\nwhen adopted will give assurance that the improvements will yield\r\npractical results in the way of increased navigation and water\r\ntransportation. In every essential feature the plan recommended by the\r\nCommission is new. In the principle of coordinating all uses of the\r\nwaters and treating each waterway system as a unit; in the principle\r\nof correlating water traffic with rail and other land traffic; in the\r\nprinciple of expert initiation of projects in accordance with commercial\r\nforesight and the needs of a growing country; and in the principle\r\nof cooperation between the States and the Federal Government in the\r\nadministration and use of waterways, etc.; the general plan proposed by\r\nthe Commission is new, and at the same time sane and simple. The plan\r\ndeserves unqualified support. I regret that it has not yet been adopted\r\nby Congress, but I am confident that ultimately it will be adopted.\"\r\n\r\nThe most striking incident in the history of the Commission was the trip\r\ndown the Mississippi River in October, 1907, when, as President of the\r\nUnited States, I was the chief guest. This excursion, with the meetings\r\nwhich were held and the wide public attention it attracted, gave the\r\ndevelopment of our inland waterways a new standing in public estimation.\r\nDuring the trip a letter was prepared and presented to me asking me\r\nto summon a conference on the conservation of natural resources. My\r\nintention to call such a conference was publicly announced at a great\r\nmeeting at Memphis, Tenn.\r\n\r\nIn the November following I wrote to each of the Governors of the\r\nseveral States and to the Presidents of various important National\r\nSocieties concerned with natural resources, inviting them to attend the\r\nconference, which took place May 13 to 15, 1908, in the East Room of the\r\nWhite House. It is doubtful whether, except in time of war, any new idea\r\nof like importance has ever been presented to a Nation and accepted\r\nby it with such effectiveness and rapidity, as was the case with this\r\nConservation movement when it was introduced to the American people\r\nby the Conference of Governors. The first result was the unanimous\r\ndeclaration of the Governors of all the States and Territories upon\r\nthe subject of Conservation, a document which ought to be hung in every\r\nschoolhouse throughout the land. A further result was the appointment of\r\nthirty-six State Conservation Commissions and, on June 8, 1908, of the\r\nNational Conservation Commission. The task of this Commission was to\r\nprepare an inventory, the first ever made for any nation, of all the\r\nnatural resources which underlay its property. The making of this\r\ninventory was made possible by an Executive order which placed\r\nthe resources of the Government Departments at the command of the\r\nCommission, and made possible the organization of subsidiary committees\r\nby which the actual facts for the inventory were prepared and digested.\r\nGifford Pinchot was made chairman of the Commission.\r\n\r\nThe report of the National Conservation Commission was not only the\r\nfirst inventory of our resources, but was unique in the history of\r\nGovernment in the amount and variety of information brought together. It\r\nwas completed in six months. It laid squarely before the American people\r\nthe essential facts regarding our natural resources, when facts were\r\ngreatly needed as the basis for constructive action. This report was\r\npresented to the Joint Conservation Congress in December, at which there\r\nwere present Governors of twenty States, representatives of twenty-two\r\nState Conservation Commissions, and representatives of sixty National\r\norganizations previously represented at the White House conference.\r\nThe report was unanimously approved, and transmitted to me, January\r\n11, 1909. On January 22, 1909, I transmitted the report of the National\r\nConservation Commission to Congress with a Special Message, in which\r\nit was accurately described as \"one of the most fundamentally important\r\ndocuments ever laid before the American people.\"\r\n\r\nThe Joint Conservation Conference of December, 1908, suggested to me the\r\npracticability of holding a North American Conservation Conference. I\r\nselected Gifford Pinchot to convey this invitation in person to Lord\r\nGrey, Governor General of Canada; to Sir Wilfrid Laurier; and to\r\nPresident Diaz of Mexico; giving as reason for my action, in the letter\r\nin which this invitation was conveyed, the fact that: \"It is evident\r\nthat natural resources are not limited by the boundary lines which\r\nseparate nations, and that the need for conserving them upon this\r\ncontinent is as wide as the area upon which they exist.\"\r\n\r\nIn response to this invitation, which included the colony of\r\nNewfoundland, the Commissioners assembled in the White House on February\r\n18, 1909. The American Commissioners were Gifford Pinchot, Robert Bacon,\r\nand James R. Garfield. After a session continuing through five days, the\r\nConference united in a declaration of principles, and suggested to the\r\nPresident of the United States \"that all nations should be invited to\r\njoin together in conference on the subject of world resources, and their\r\ninventory, conservation, and wise utilization.\" Accordingly, on February\r\n19, 1909, Robert Bacon, Secretary of State, addressed to forty-five\r\nnations a letter of invitation \"to send delegates to a conference to be\r\nheld at The Hague at such date to be found convenient, there to meet\r\nand consult the like delegates of the other countries, with a view of\r\nconsidering a general plan for an inventory of the natural resources\r\nof the world and to devising a uniform scheme for the expression of\r\nthe results of such inventory, to the end that there may be a general\r\nunderstanding and appreciation of the world's supply of the material\r\nelements which underlie the development of civilization and the welfare\r\nof the peoples of the earth.\" After I left the White House the project\r\nlapsed.\r\n\r\nThroughout the early part of my Administration the public land policy\r\nwas chiefly directed to the defense of the public lands against fraud\r\nand theft. Secretary Hitchcock's efforts along this line resulted in\r\nthe Oregon land fraud cases, which led to the conviction of Senator\r\nMitchell, and which made Francis J. Heney known to the American people\r\nas one of their best and most effective servants. These land fraud\r\nprosecutions under Mr. Heney, together with the study of the public\r\nlands which preceded the passage of the Reclamation Act in 1902, and\r\nthe investigation of land titles in the National Forests by the Forest\r\nService, all combined to create a clearer understanding of the need of\r\nland law reform, and thus led to the appointment of the Public Lands\r\nCommission. This Commission, appointed by me on October 22, 1903, was\r\ndirected to report to the President: \"Upon the condition, operation, and\r\neffect of the present land laws, and to recommend such changes as are\r\nneeded to effect the largest practicable disposition of the public lands\r\nto actual settlers who will build permanent homes upon them, and to\r\nsecure in permanence the fullest and most effective use of the resources\r\nof the public lands.\" It proceeded without loss of time to make a\r\npersonal study on the ground of public land problems throughout the\r\nWest, to confer with the Governors and other public men most concerned,\r\nand to assemble the information concerning the public lands, the laws\r\nand decisions which governed them, and the methods of defeating or\r\nevading those laws, which was already in existence, but which remained\r\nunformulated in the records of the General Land Office and in the mind\r\nof its employees. The Public Lands Commission made its first preliminary\r\nreport on March 7, 1904. It found \"that the present land laws do not fit\r\nthe conditions of the remaining public lands,\" and recommended specific\r\nchanges to meet the public needs. A year later the second report of the\r\nCommission recommended still further changes, and said \"The fundamental\r\nfact that characterizes the situation under the present land laws\r\nis this, that the number of patents issued is increasing out of all\r\nproportion to the number of new homes.\" This report laid the foundation\r\nof the movement for Government control of the open range, and included\r\nby far the most complete statement ever made of the disposition of the\r\npublic domain.\r\n\r\nAmong the most difficult topics considered by the Public Lands\r\nCommission was that of the mineral land laws. This subject was referred\r\nby the Commission to the American Institute of Mining Engineers, which\r\nreported upon it through a Committee. This Committee made the very\r\nimportant recommendation, among others, \"that the Government of the\r\nUnited States should retain title to all minerals, including coal\r\nand oil, in the lands of unceded territory, and lease the same to\r\nindividuals or corporations at a fixed rental.\" The necessity for\r\nthis action has since come to be very generally recognized. Another\r\nrecommendation, since partly carried into effect, was for the separation\r\nof the surface and the minerals in lands containing coal and oil.\r\n\r\nOur land laws have of recent years proved inefficient; yet the land laws\r\nthemselves have not been so much to blame as the lax, unintelligent, and\r\noften corrupt administration of these laws. The appointment on March 4,\r\n1907, of James R. Garfield as Secretary of the Interior led to a new era\r\nin the interpretation and enforcement of the laws governing the\r\npublic lands. His administration of the Interior Department was beyond\r\ncomparison the best we have ever had. It was based primarily on the\r\nconception that it is as much the duty of public land officials to\r\nhelp the honest settler get title to his claim as it is to prevent the\r\nlooting of the public lands. The essential fact about public land frauds\r\nis not merely that public property is stolen, but that every claim\r\nfraudulently acquired stands in the way of the making of a home or a\r\nlivelihood by an honest man.\r\n\r\nAs the study of the public land laws proceeded and their administration\r\nimproved, a public land policy was formulated in which the saving of\r\nthe resources on the public domain for public use became the leading\r\nprinciple. There followed the withdrawal of coal lands as already\r\ndescribed, of oil lands and phosphate lands, and finally, just at the\r\nend of the Administration, of water-power sites on the public domain.\r\nThese withdrawals were made by the Executive in order to afford to\r\nCongress the necessary opportunity to pass wise laws dealing with their\r\nuse and disposal; and the great crooked special interests fought them\r\nwith incredible bitterness.\r\n\r\nAmong the men of this Nation interested in the vital problems affecting\r\nthe welfare of the ordinary hard-working men and women of the Nation,\r\nthere is none whose interest has been more intense, and more wholly free\r\nfrom taint of thought of self, than that of Thomas Watson, of Georgia.\r\nWhile President I often discussed with him the condition of women on\r\nthe small farms, and on the frontier, the hardship of their lives as\r\ncompared with those of the men, and the need for taking their welfare\r\ninto consideration in whatever was done for the improvement of life on\r\nthe land. I also went over the matter with C. S. Barrett, of Georgia,\r\na leader in the Southern farmers' movement, and with other men, such as\r\nHenry Wallace, Dean L. H. Bailey, of Cornell, and Kenyon Butterfield.\r\nOne man from whose advice I especially profited was not an American, but\r\nan Irishman, Sir Horace Plunkett. In various conversations he described\r\nto me and my close associates the reconstruction of farm life which had\r\nbeen accomplished by the Agricultural Organization Society of Ireland,\r\nof which he was the founder and the controlling force; and he discussed\r\nthe application of similar methods to the improvements of farm life\r\nin the United States. In the spring of 1908, at my request, Plunkett\r\nconferred on the subject with Garfield and Pinchot, and the latter\r\nsuggested to him the appointment of a Commission on Country Life as a\r\nmeans for directing the attention of the Nation to the problems of the\r\nfarm, and for securing the necessary knowledge of the actual conditions\r\nof life in the open country. After long discussion a plan for a Country\r\nLife Commission was laid before me and approved. The appointment of the\r\nCommission followed in August, 1908. In the letter of appointment the\r\nreasons for creating the Commission were set forth as follows: \"I doubt\r\nif any other nation can bear comparison with our own in the amount\r\nof attention given by the Government, both Federal and State, to\r\nagricultural matters. But practically the whole of this effort has\r\nhitherto been directed toward increasing the production of crops. Our\r\nattention has been concentrated almost exclusively on getting better\r\nfarming. In the beginning this was unquestionably the right thing to do.\r\nThe farmer must first of all grow good crops in order to support himself\r\nand his family. But when this has been secured, the effort for better\r\nfarming should cease to stand alone, and should be accompanied by the\r\neffort for better business and better living on the farm. It is at least\r\nas important that the farmer should get the largest possible return in\r\nmoney, comfort, and social advantages from the crops he grows, as that\r\nhe should get the largest possible return in crops from the land he\r\nfarms. Agriculture is not the whole of country life. The great rural\r\ninterests are human interests, and good crops are of little value to the\r\nfarmer unless they open the door to a good kind of life on the farm.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission on Country Life did work of capital importance. By means\r\nof a widely circulated set of questions the Commission informed itself\r\nupon the status of country life throughout the Nation. Its trip through\r\nthe East, South, and West brought it into contact with large numbers of\r\npractical farmers and their wives, secured for the Commissioners a most\r\nvaluable body of first-hand information, and laid the foundation for the\r\nremarkable awakening of interest in country life which has since taken\r\nplace throughout the Nation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most illuminating--and incidentally one of the most\r\ninteresting and amusing--series of answers sent to the Commission was\r\nfrom a farmer in Missouri. He stated that he had a wife and 11 living\r\nchildren, he and his wife being each 52 years old; and that they owned\r\n520 acres of land without any mortgage hanging over their heads. He had\r\nhimself done well, and his views as to why many of his neighbors had\r\ndone less well are entitled to consideration. These views are expressed\r\nin terse and vigorous English; they cannot always be quoted in full. He\r\nstates that the farm homes in his neighborhood are not as good as they\r\nshould be because too many of them are encumbered by mortgages; that the\r\nschools do not train boys and girls satisfactorily for life on the farm,\r\nbecause they allow them to get an idea in their heads that city life is\r\nbetter, and that to remedy this practical farming should be taught. To\r\nthe question whether the farmers and their wives in his neighborhood are\r\nsatisfactorily organized, he answers: \"Oh, there is a little one-horse\r\ngrange gang in our locality, and every darned one thinks they ought\r\nto be a king.\" To the question, \"Are the renters of farms in your\r\nneighborhood making a satisfactory living?\" he answers: \"No; because\r\nthey move about so much hunting a better job.\" To the question, \"Is the\r\nsupply of farm labor in your neighborhood satisfactory?\" the answer is:\r\n\"No; because the people have gone out of the baby business\"; and when\r\nasked as to the remedy, he answers, \"Give a pension to every mother who\r\ngives birth to seven living boys on American soil.\" To the question,\r\n\"Are the conditions surrounding hired labor on the farm in your\r\nneighborhood satisfactory to the hired men?\" he answers: \"Yes, unless he\r\nis a drunken cuss,\" adding that he would like to blow up the stillhouses\r\nand root out whiskey and beer. To the question, \"Are the sanitary\r\nconditions on the farms in your neighborhood satisfactory?\" he answers:\r\n\"No; too careless about chicken yards, and the like, and poorly covered\r\nwells. In one well on neighbor's farm I counted seven snakes in the wall\r\nof the well, and they used the water daily: his wife dead now and he is\r\nlooking for another.\" He ends by stating that the most important single\r\nthing to be done for the betterment of country life is \"good roads\"; but\r\nin his answers he shows very clearly that most important of all is the\r\nindividual equation of the man or woman.\r\n\r\nLike the rest of the Commissions described in this chapter, the Country\r\nLife Commission cost the Government not one cent, but laid before the\r\nPresident and the country a mass of information so accurate and so\r\nvitally important as to disturb the serenity of the advocates of things\r\nas they are; and therefore it incurred the bitter opposition of the\r\nreactionaries. The report of the Country Life Commission was transmitted\r\nto Congress by me on February 9, 1909. In the accompanying message I\r\nasked for $25,000 to print and circulate the report and to prepare for\r\npublication the immense amount of valuable material collected by the\r\nCommission but still unpublished. The reply made by Congress was not\r\nonly a refusal to appropriate the money, but a positive prohibition\r\nagainst continuing the work. The Tawney amendment to the Sundry Civil\r\nbill forbade the President to appoint any further Commissions unless\r\nspecifically authorized by Congress to do so. Had this prohibition\r\nbeen enacted earlier _and complied with_, it would have prevented the\r\nappointment of the six Roosevelt commissions. But I would not have\r\ncomplied with it. Mr. Tawney, one of the most efficient representatives\r\nof the cause of special privilege as against public interest to be found\r\nin the House, was later, in conjunction with Senator Hale and others,\r\nable to induce my successor to accept their view. As what was almost my\r\nlast official act, I replied to Congress that if I did not believe the\r\nTawney amendment to be unconstitutional I would veto the Sundry Civil\r\nbill which contained it, and that if I were remaining in office I would\r\nrefuse to obey it. The memorandum ran in part:\r\n\r\n\"The chief object of this provision, however, is to prevent the\r\nExecutive repeating what it has done within the last year in connection\r\nwith the Conservation Commission and the Country Life Commission. It is\r\nfor the people of the country to decide whether or not they believe in\r\nthe work done by the Conservation Commission and by the Country Life\r\nCommission. . . .\r\n\r\n\"If they believe in improving our waterways, in preventing the waste of\r\nsoil, in preserving the forests, in thrifty use of the mineral resources\r\nof the country for the nation as a whole rather than merely for private\r\nmonopolies, in working for the betterment of the condition of the men\r\nand women who live on the farms, then they will unstintedly condemn the\r\naction of every man who is in any way responsible for inserting this\r\nprovision, and will support those members of the legislative branch who\r\nopposed its adoption. I would not sign the bill at all if I thought\r\nthe provision entirely effective. But the Congress cannot prevent the\r\nPresident from seeking advice. Any future President can do as I have\r\ndone, and ask disinterested men who desire to serve the people to give\r\nthis service free to the people through these commissions. . . .\r\n\r\n\"My successor, the President-elect, in a letter to the Senate Committee\r\non Appropriations, asked for the continuance and support of the\r\nConservation Commission. The Conservation Commission was appointed at\r\nthe request of the Governors of over forty States, and almost all of\r\nthese States have since appointed commissions to cooperate with the\r\nNational Commission. Nearly all the great national organizations\r\nconcerned with natural resources have been heartily cooperating with the\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\n\"With all these facts before it, the Congress has refused to pass a law\r\nto continue and provide for the commission; and it now passes a law with\r\nthe purpose of preventing the Executive from continuing the commission\r\nat all. The Executive, therefore, must now either abandon the work and\r\nreject the cooperation of the States, or else must continue the work\r\npersonally and through executive officers whom he may select for that\r\npurpose.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chamber of Commerce of Spokane, Washington, a singularly energetic\r\nand far-seeing organization, itself published the report which Congress\r\nhad thus discreditably refused to publish.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Bureau of Corporations, under Herbert Knox Smith,\r\nformed an important part of the Conservation movement almost from the\r\nbeginning. Mr. Smith was a member of the Inland Waterways Commission and\r\nof the National Conservation Commission and his Bureau prepared material\r\nof importance for the reports of both. The investigation of standing\r\ntimber in the United States by the Bureau of Corporations furnished\r\nfor the first time a positive knowledge of the facts. Over nine hundred\r\ncounties in timbered regions were covered by the Bureau, and the work\r\ntook five years. The most important facts ascertained were that forty\r\nyears ago three-fourths of the standing timber in the United States\r\nwas publicly owned, while at the date of the report four-fifths of the\r\ntimber in the country was in private hands. The concentration of private\r\nownership had developed to such an amazing extent that about two hundred\r\nholders owned nearly one-half of all privately owned timber in the\r\nUnited States; and of this the three greatest holders, the Southern\r\nPacific Railway, the Northern Pacific Railway, and the Weyerhaeuser\r\nTimber Company, held over ten per cent. Of this work, Mr. Smith says:\r\n\r\n\"It was important, indeed, to know the facts so that we could take\r\nproper action toward saving the timber still left to the public. But of\r\nfar more importance was the light that this history (and the history\r\nof our other resources) throws on the basic attitude, tradition and\r\ngovernmental beliefs of the American people. The whole standpoint of\r\nthe people toward the proper aim of government, toward the relation of\r\nproperty to the citizen, and the relation of property to the government,\r\nwere brought out first by this Conservation work.\"\r\n\r\nThe work of the Bureau of Corporations as to water power was equally\r\nstriking. In addition to bringing the concentration of water-power\r\ncontrol first prominently to public attention, through material\r\nfurnished for my message in my veto of the James River Dam Bill, the\r\nwork of the Bureau showed that ten great interests and their allies held\r\nnearly sixty per cent of the developed water power of the United States.\r\nSays Commissioner Smith: \"Perhaps the most important thing in the whole\r\nwork was its clear demonstration of the fact that the only effective\r\nplace to control water power in the public interest is at the power\r\nsites; that as to powers now owned by the public it is absolutely\r\nessential that the public shall retain title. . . . The only way in\r\nwhich the public can get back to itself the margin of natural advantage\r\nin the water-power site is to rent that site at a rental which, added\r\nto the cost of power production there, will make the total cost of water\r\npower about the same as fuel power, and then let the two sell at the\r\nsame price, i. e., the price of fuel power.\"\r\n\r\nOf the fight of the water-power men for States Rights at the St. Paul\r\nConservation Congress in September, 1909, Commissioner Smith says:\r\n\r\n\"It was the first open sign of the shift of the special interests to the\r\nDemocratic party for a logical political reason, namely, because of the\r\navailability of the States Rights idea for the purposes of the large\r\ncorporations. It marked openly the turn of the tide.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Smith brought to the attention of the Inland Waterways Commission\r\nthe overshadowing importance to waterways of their relation with\r\nrailroad lines, the fact that the bulk of the traffic is long distance\r\ntraffic, that it cannot pass over the whole distance by water, while it\r\ncan go anywhere by rail, and that therefore the power of the rail lines\r\nto pro-rate or not to pro-rate, with water lines really determines the\r\npractical value of a river channel. The controlling value of terminals\r\nand the fact that out of fifty of our leading ports, over half the\r\nactive water frontage in twenty-one ports was controlled by the\r\nrailroads, was also brought to the Commission's attention, and reports\r\nof great value were prepared both for the Inland Waterways Commission\r\nand for the National Conservation Commission. In addition to developing\r\nthe basic facts about the available timber supply, about waterways,\r\nwater power, and iron ore, Mr. Smith helped to develop and drive into\r\nthe public conscience the idea that the people ought to retain title to\r\nour natural resources and handle them by the leasing system.\r\n\r\nThe things accomplished that have been enumerated above were of\r\nimmediate consequence to the economic well-being of our people. In\r\naddition certain things were done of which the economic bearing was more\r\nremote, but which bore directly upon our welfare, because they add to\r\nthe beauty of living and therefore to the joy of life. Securing a great\r\nartist, Saint-Gaudens, to give us the most beautiful coinage since the\r\ndecay of Hellenistic Greece was one such act. In this case I had power\r\nmyself to direct the Mint to employ Saint-Gaudens. The first, and\r\nmost beautiful, of his coins were issued in thousands before Congress\r\nassembled or could intervene; and a great and permanent improvement was\r\nmade in the beauty of the coinage. In the same way, on the advice\r\nand suggestion of Frank Millet, we got some really capital medals by\r\nsculptors of the first rank. Similarly, the new buildings in Washington\r\nwere erected and placed in proper relation to one another, on plans\r\nprovided by the best architects and landscape architects. I also\r\nappointed a Fine Arts Council, an unpaid body of the best architects,\r\npainters, and sculptors in the country, to advise the Government as\r\nto the erection and decoration of all new buildings. The \"pork-barrel\"\r\nSenators and Congressmen felt for this body an instinctive, and perhaps\r\nfrom their standpoint a natural, hostility; and my successor a couple\r\nof months after taking office revoked the appointment and disbanded the\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nEven more important was the taking of steps to preserve from destruction\r\nbeautiful and wonderful wild creatures whose existence was threatened by\r\ngreed and wantonness. During the seven and a half years closing on March\r\n4, 1909, more was accomplished for the protection of wild life in the\r\nUnited States than during all the previous years, excepting only the\r\ncreation of the Yellowstone National Park. The record includes the\r\ncreation of five National Parks--Crater Lake, Oregon; Wind Cave, South\r\nDakota; Platt, Oklahoma; Sully Hill, North Dakota, and Mesa Verde,\r\nColorado; four big game refuges in Oklahoma, Arizona, Montana, and\r\nWashington; fifty-one bird reservations; and the enactment of laws for\r\nthe protection of wild life in Alaska, the District of Columbia, and\r\non National bird reserves. These measures may be briefly enumerated as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe enactment of the first game laws for the Territory of Alaska in\r\n1902 and 1908, resulting in the regulation of the export of heads and\r\ntrophies of big game and putting an end to the slaughter of deer for\r\nhides along the southern coast of the Territory.\r\n\r\nThe securing in 1902 of the first appropriation for the preservation of\r\nbuffalo and the establishment in the Yellowstone National Park of the\r\nfirst and now the largest herd of buffalo belonging to the Government.\r\n\r\nThe passage of the Act of January 24, 1905, creating the Wichita Game\r\nPreserves, the first of the National game preserves.

Among these\r\nreservations are the celebrated Pelican Island rookery in Indian River,\r\nFlorida; the Mosquito Inlet Reservation, Florida, the northernmost home\r\nof the manatee; the extensive marshes bordering Klamath and Malhuer\r\nLakes in Oregon, formerly the scene of slaughter of ducks for market\r\nand ruthless destruction of plume birds for the millinery trade; the\r\nTortugas Key, Florida, where, in connection with the Carnegie Institute,\r\nexperiments have been made on the homing instinct of birds; and the\r\ngreat bird colonies on Laysan and sister islets in Hawaii, some of the\r\ngreatest colonies of sea birds in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE BIG STICK AND THE SQUARE DEAL\r\n\r\nOne of the vital questions with which as President I had to deal was the\r\nattitude of the Nation toward the great corporations. Men who understand\r\nand practice the deep underlying philosophy of the Lincoln school of\r\nAmerican political thought are necessarily Hamiltonian in their belief\r\nin a strong and efficient National Government and Jeffersonian in their\r\nbelief in the people as the ultimate authority, and in the welfare\r\nof the people as the end of Government. The men who first applied the\r\nextreme Democratic theory in American life were, like Jefferson, ultra\r\nindividualists, for at that time what was demanded by our people was the\r\nlargest liberty for the individual. During the century that had elapsed\r\nsince Jefferson became President the need had been exactly reversed.\r\nThere had been in our country a riot of individualistic materialism,\r\nunder which complete freedom for the individual--that ancient license\r\nwhich President Wilson a century after the term was excusable has called\r\nthe \"New\" Freedom--turned out in practice to mean perfect freedom for\r\nthe strong to wrong the weak. The total absence of governmental control\r\nhad led to a portentous growth in the financial and industrial world\r\nboth of natural individuals and of artificial individuals--that is,\r\ncorporations. In no other country in the world had such enormous\r\nfortunes been gained. In no other country in the world was such power\r\nheld by the men who had gained these fortunes; and these men almost\r\nalways worked through, and by means of, the giant corporations which\r\nthey controlled. The power of the mighty industrial overlords of\r\nthe country had increased with giant strides, while the methods of\r\ncontrolling them, or checking abuses by them, on the part of the people,\r\nthrough the Government, remained archaic and therefore practically\r\nimpotent. The courts, not unnaturally, but most regrettably, and to\r\nthe grave detriment of the people and of their own standing, had for a\r\nquarter of a century been on the whole the agents of reaction, and by\r\nconflicting decisions which, however, in their sum were hostile to the\r\ninterests of the people, had left both the nation and the several\r\nStates well-nigh impotent to deal with the great business combinations.\r\nSometimes they forbade the Nation to interfere, because such\r\ninterference trespassed on the rights of the States; sometimes they\r\nforbade the States to interfere (and often they were wise in this),\r\nbecause to do so would trespass on the rights of the Nation; but always,\r\nor well-nigh always, their action was negative action against the\r\ninterests of the people, ingeniously devised to limit their power\r\nagainst wrong, instead of affirmative action giving to the people power\r\nto right wrong. They had rendered these decisions sometimes as upholders\r\nof property rights against human rights, being especially zealous in\r\nsecuring the rights of the very men who were most competent to take care\r\nof themselves; and sometimes in the name of liberty, in the name of\r\nthe so-called \"new freedom,\" in reality the old, old \"freedom,\"\r\nwhich secured to the powerful the freedom to prey on the poor and the\r\nhelpless.\r\n\r\nOne of the main troubles was the fact that the men who saw the evils and\r\nwho tried to remedy them attempted to work in two wholly different ways,\r\nand the great majority of them in a way that offered little promise of\r\nreal betterment. They tried (by the Sherman law method) to bolster up\r\nan individualism already proved to be both futile and mischievous; to\r\nremedy by more individualism the concentration that was the inevitable\r\nresult of the already existing individualism. They saw the evil done\r\nby the big combinations, and sought to remedy it by destroying them and\r\nrestoring the country to the economic conditions of the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century. This was a hopeless effort, and those who went into\r\nit, although they regarded themselves as radical progressives, really\r\nrepresented a form of sincere rural toryism. They confounded monopolies\r\nwith big business combinations, and in the effort to prohibit both\r\nalike, instead of where possible prohibiting one and drastically\r\ncontrolling the other, they succeeded merely in preventing any effective\r\ncontrol of either.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a few men recognized that corporations and\r\ncombinations had become indispensable in the business world, that it was\r\nfolly to try to prohibit them, but that it was also folly to leave them\r\nwithout thoroughgoing control. These men realized that the doctrines\r\nof the old laissez faire economists, of the believers in unlimited\r\ncompetition, unlimited individualism, were in the actual state of\r\naffairs false and mischievous. They realized that the Government must\r\nnow interfere to protect labor, to subordinate the big corporation\r\nto the public welfare, and to shackle cunning and fraud exactly as\r\ncenturies before it had interfered to shackle the physical force which\r\ndoes wrong by violence.\r\n\r\nThe big reactionaries of the business world and their allies and\r\ninstruments among politicians and newspaper editors took advantage of\r\nthis division of opinion, and especially of the fact that most of their\r\nopponents were on the wrong path; and fought to keep matters absolutely\r\nunchanged. These men demanded for themselves an immunity from\r\ngovernmental control which, if granted, would have been as wicked and as\r\nfoolish as immunity to the barons of the twelfth century. Many of them\r\nwere evil men. Many others were just as good men as were some of\r\nthese same barons; but they were as utterly unable as any medieval\r\ncastle-owner to understand what the public interest really was. There\r\nhave been aristocracies which have played a great and beneficent part at\r\nstages in the growth of mankind; but we had come to the stage where for\r\nour people what was needed was a real democracy; and of all forms of\r\ntyranny the least attractive and the most vulgar is the tyranny of mere\r\nwealth, the tyranny of a plutocracy.\r\n\r\nWhen I became President, the question as to the method by which the\r\nUnited States Government was to control the corporations was not yet\r\nimportant. The absolutely vital question was whether the Government had\r\npower to control them at all. This question had not yet been decided in\r\nfavor of the United States Government. It was useless to discuss methods\r\nof controlling big business by the National Government until it was\r\ndefinitely settled that the National Government had the power to control\r\nit. A decision of the Supreme Court had, with seeming definiteness,\r\nsettled that the National Government had not the power.\r\n\r\nThis decision I caused to be annulled by the court that had rendered\r\nit; and the present power of the National Government to deal effectively\r\nwith the trusts is due solely to the success of the Administration in\r\nsecuring this reversal of its former decision by the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution was formed very largely because it had become\r\nimperative to give to some central authority the power to regulate and\r\ncontrol interstate commerce. At that time when corporations were in\r\ntheir infancy and big combinations unknown, there was no difficulty\r\nin exercising the power granted. In theory, the right of the Nation\r\nto exercise this power continued unquestioned. But changing conditions\r\nobscured the matter in the sight of the people as a whole; and\r\nthe conscious and the unconscious advocates of an unlimited and\r\nuncontrollable capitalism gradually secured the whittling away of the\r\nNational power to exercise this theoretical right of control until it\r\npractically vanished. After the Civil War, with the portentous growth\r\nof industrial combinations in this country, came a period of reactionary\r\ndecisions by the courts which, as regards corporations, culminated in\r\nwhat is known as the Knight case.\r\n\r\nThe Sherman Anti-Trust Law was enacted in 1890 because the formation of\r\nthe Tobacco Trust and the Sugar Trust, the only two great trusts then\r\nin the country (aside from the Standard Oil Trust, which was a gradual\r\ngrowth), had awakened a popular demand for legislation to destroy\r\nmonopoly and curb industrial combinations. This demand the Anti-Trust\r\nLaw was intended to satisfy. The Administrations of Mr. Harrison and Mr.\r\nCleveland evidently construed this law as prohibiting such combinations\r\nin the future, not as condemning those which had been formed prior\r\nto its enactment. In 1895, however, the Sugar Trust, whose output\r\noriginally was about fifty-five per cent of all sugar produced in the\r\nUnited States, obtained control of three other companies in Philadelphia\r\nby exchanging its stock for theirs, and thus increased its business\r\nuntil it controlled ninety-eight per cent of the entire product. Under\r\nCleveland, the Government brought proceedings against the Sugar Trust,\r\ninvoking the Anti-Trust Law, to set aside the acquisition of these\r\ncorporations. The test case was on the absorption of the Knight Company.\r\nThe Supreme Court of the United States, with but one dissenting vote,\r\nheld adversely to the Government. They took the ground that the power\r\nconferred by the Constitution to regulate and control interstate\r\ncommerce did not extend to the production or manufacture of commodities\r\nwithin a State, and that nothing in the Sherman Anti-Trust Law\r\nprohibited a corporation from acquiring all the stock of other\r\ncorporations through exchange of its stock for theirs, such exchange\r\nnot being \"commerce\" in the opinion of the Court, even though by such\r\nacquisition the corporation was enabled to control the entire production\r\nof a commodity that was a necessary of life. The effect of this decision\r\nwas not merely the absolute nullification of the Anti-Trust Law, so\r\nfar as industrial corporations were concerned, but was also in effect a\r\ndeclaration that, under the Constitution, the National Government could\r\npass no law really effective for the destruction or control of such\r\ncombinations.\r\n\r\nThis decision left the National Government, that is, the people of the\r\nNation, practically helpless to deal with the large combinations of\r\nmodern business. The courts in other cases asserted the power of\r\nthe Federal Government to enforce the Anti-Trust Law so far as\r\ntransportation rates by railways engaged in interstate commerce were\r\nconcerned. But so long as the trusts were free to control the production\r\nof commodities without interference from the General Government, they\r\nwere well content to let the transportation of commodities take care of\r\nitself--especially as the law against rebates was at that time a dead\r\nletter; and the Court by its decision in the Knight case had interdicted\r\nany interference by the President or by Congress with the production of\r\ncommodities. It was on the authority of this case that practically all\r\nthe big trusts in the United States, excepting those already mentioned,\r\nwere formed. Usually they were organized as \"holding\" companies, each\r\none acquiring control of its constituent corporations by exchanging its\r\nstock for theirs, an operation which the Supreme Court had thus decided\r\ncould not be prohibited, controlled, regulated, or even questioned by\r\nthe Federal Government.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of our laws when I acceded to the Presidency.\r\nJust before my accession, a small group of financiers, desiring to\r\nprofit by the governmental impotence to which we had been reduced by the\r\nKnight decision, had arranged to take control of practically the entire\r\nrailway system in the Northwest--possibly as the first step toward\r\ncontrolling the entire railway system of the country. This control of\r\nthe Northwestern railway systems was to be effected by organizing a new\r\n\"holding\" company, and exchanging its stock against the stock of the\r\nvarious corporations engaged in railway transportation throughout that\r\nvast territory, exactly as the Sugar Trust had acquired control of the\r\nKnight company and other concerns. This company was called the Northern\r\nSecurities Company. Not long after I became President, on the advice of\r\nthe Attorney-General, Mr. Knox, and through him, I ordered proceedings\r\nto be instituted for the dissolution of the company. As far as could be\r\ntold by their utterances at the time, among all the great lawyers in the\r\nUnited States Mr. Knox was the only one who believed that this action\r\ncould be sustained. The defense was based expressly on the ground that\r\nthe Supreme Court in the Knight case had explicitly sanctioned the\r\nformation of such a company as the Northern Securities Company. The\r\nrepresentatives of privilege intimated, and sometimes asserted outright,\r\nthat in directing the action to be brought I had shown a lack of respect\r\nfor the Supreme Court, which had already decided the question at issue\r\nby a vote of eight to one. Mr. Justice White, then on the Court and\r\nnow Chief Justice, set forth the position that the two cases were in\r\nprinciple identical with incontrovertible logic. In giving the views of\r\nthe dissenting minority on the action I had brought, he said:\r\n\r\n\"The parallel between the two cases [the Knight case and the Northern\r\nSecurities case] is complete. The one corporation acquired the stock\r\nof other and competing corporations in exchange for its own. It was\r\nconceded for the purposes of the case, that in doing so monopoly had\r\nbeen brought about in the refining of sugar, that the sugar to be\r\nproduced was likely to become the subject of interstate commerce, and\r\nindeed that part of it would certainly become so. But the power of\r\nCongress was decided not to extend to the subject, because the ownership\r\nof the stock in the corporations was not itself commerce.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Justice White was entirely correct in this statement. The cases were\r\nparallel. It was necessary to reverse the Knight case in the interests\r\nof the people against monopoly and privilege just as it had been\r\nnecessary to reverse the Dred Scott case in the interest of the people\r\nagainst slavery and privilege; just as later it became necessary to\r\nreverse the New York Bakeshop case in the interest of the people\r\nagainst that form of monopolistic privilege which put human rights below\r\nproperty rights where wage workers were concerned.\r\n\r\nBy a vote of five to four the Supreme Court reversed its decision in\r\nthe Knight case, and in the Northern Securities case sustained the\r\nGovernment. The power to deal with industrial monopoly and suppress it\r\nand to control and regulate combinations, of which the Knight case had\r\ndeprived the Federal Government, was thus restored to it by the Northern\r\nSecurities case. After this later decision was rendered, suits were\r\nbrought by my direction against the American Tobacco Company and the\r\nStandard Oil Company. Both were adjudged criminal conspiracies, and\r\ntheir dissolution ordered. The Knight case was finally overthrown.\r\nThe vicious doctrine it embodied no longer remains as an obstacle to\r\nobstruct the pathway of justice when it assails monopoly. Messrs.\r\nKnox, Moody, and Bonaparte, who successively occupied the position of\r\nAttorney-General under me, were profound lawyers and fearless and\r\nable men; and they completely established the newer and more wholesome\r\ndoctrine under which the Federal Government may now deal with\r\nmonopolistic combinations and conspiracies.\r\n\r\nThe decisions rendered in these various cases brought under my direction\r\nconstitute the entire authority upon which any action must rest that\r\nseeks through the exercise of national power to curb monopolistic\r\ncontrol. The men who organized and directed the Northern Securities\r\nCompany were also the controlling forces in the Steel Corporation, which\r\nhas since been prosecuted under the act. The proceedings against the\r\nSugar Trust for corruption in connection with the New York Custom House\r\nare sufficiently interesting to be considered separately.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of giving complete control to the National\r\nGovernment over big corporations engaged in inter-State business, it\r\nwould be impossible to over-estimate the importance of the Northern\r\nSecurities decision and of the decisions afterwards rendered in line\r\nwith it in connection with the other trusts whose dissolution was\r\nordered. The success of the Northern Securities case definitely\r\nestablished the power of the Government to deal with all great\r\ncorporations. Without this success the National Government must have\r\nremained in the impotence to which it had been reduced by the Knight\r\ndecision as regards the most important of its internal functions. But\r\nour success in establishing the power of the National Government to curb\r\nmonopolies did not establish the right method of exercising that\r\npower. We had gained the power. We had not devised the proper method of\r\nexercising it.\r\n\r\nMonopolies can, although in rather cumbrous fashion, be broken up by\r\nlaw suits. Great business combinations, however, cannot possibly be made\r\nuseful instead of noxious industrial agencies merely by law suits, and\r\nespecially by law suits supposed to be carried on for their destruction\r\nand not for their control and regulation. I at once began to urge upon\r\nCongress the need of laws supplementing the Anti-Trust Law--for this law\r\nstruck at all big business, good and bad, alike, and as the event\r\nproved was very inefficient in checking bad big business, and yet was\r\na constant threat against decent business men. I strongly urged the\r\ninauguration of a system of thoroughgoing and drastic Governmental\r\nregulation and control over all big business combinations engaged in\r\ninter-State industry.\r\n\r\nHere I was able to accomplish only a small part of what I desired to\r\naccomplish. I was opposed both by the foolish radicals who desired to\r\nbreak up all big business, with the impossible ideal of returning to\r\nmid-nineteenth century industrial conditions; and also by the great\r\nprivileged interests themselves, who used these ordinarily--but\r\nsometimes not entirely--well-meaning \"stool pigeon progressives\" to\r\nfurther their own cause. The worst representatives of big business\r\nencouraged the outcry for the total abolition of big business, because\r\nthey knew that they could not be hurt in this way, and that such an\r\noutcry distracted the attention of the public from the really efficient\r\nmethod of controlling and supervising them, in just but masterly\r\nfashion, which was advocated by the sane representatives of reform.\r\nHowever, we succeeded in making a good beginning by securing the passage\r\nof a law creating the Department of Commerce and Labor, and with it the\r\nerection of the Bureau of Corporations. The first head of the Department\r\nof Commerce and Labor was Mr. Cortelyou, later Secretary of the\r\nTreasury. He was succeeded by Mr. Oscar Straus. The first head of\r\nthe Bureau of Corporations was Mr. Garfield, who was succeeded by Mr.\r\nHerbert Knox Smith. No four better public servants from the standpoint\r\nof the people as a whole could have been found.\r\n\r\nThe Standard Oil Company took the lead in opposing all this legislation.\r\nThis was natural, for it had been the worst offender in the amassing of\r\nenormous fortunes by improper methods of all kinds, at the expense of\r\nbusiness rivals and of the public, including the corruption of public\r\nservants. If any man thinks this condemnation extreme, I refer him to\r\nthe language officially used by the Supreme Court of the nation in its\r\ndecision against the Standard Oil Company. Through their counsel, and\r\nby direct telegrams and letters to Senators and Congressmen from various\r\nheads of the Standard Oil organization, they did their best to kill the\r\nbill providing for the Bureau of Corporations. I got hold of one or two\r\nof these telegrams and letters, however, and promptly published them;\r\nand, as generally happens in such a case, the men who were all-powerful\r\nas long as they could work in secret and behind closed doors became\r\npowerless as soon as they were forced into the open. The bill went\r\nthrough without further difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe true way of dealing with monopoly is to prevent it by administrative\r\naction before it grows so powerful that even when courts condemn it they\r\nshrink from destroying it. The Supreme Court in the Tobacco and Standard\r\nOil cases, for instance, used very vigorous language in condemning these\r\ntrusts; but the net result of the decision was of positive advantage to\r\nthe wrongdoers, and this has tended to bring the whole body of our law\r\ninto disrepute in quarters where it is of the very highest importance\r\nthat the law be held in respect and even in reverence. My effort was to\r\nsecure the creation of a Federal Commission which should neither excuse\r\nnor tolerate monopoly, but prevent it when possible and uproot it\r\nwhen discovered; and which should in addition effectively control and\r\nregulate all big combinations, and should give honest business certainty\r\nas to what the law was and security as long as the law was obeyed. Such\r\na Commission would furnish a steady expert control, a control adapted to\r\nthe problem; and dissolution is neither control nor regulation, but is\r\npurely negative; and negative remedies are of little permanent avail.\r\nSuch a Commission would have complete power to examine into every big\r\ncorporation engaged or proposing to engage in business between the\r\nStates. It would have the power to discriminate sharply between\r\ncorporations that are doing well and those that are doing ill; and the\r\ndistinction between those who do well and those who do ill would\r\nbe defined in terms so clear and unmistakable that no one could\r\nmisapprehend them. Where a company is found seeking its profits through\r\nserving the community by stimulating production, lowering prices, or\r\nimproving service, while scrupulously respecting the rights of others\r\n(including its rivals, its employees, its customers, and the general\r\npublic), and strictly obeying the law, then no matter how large its\r\ncapital, or how great the volume of its business it would be encouraged\r\nto still more abundant production, or better service, by the fullest\r\nprotection that the Government could afford it. On the other hand, if\r\na corporation were found seeking profit through injury or oppression\r\nof the community, by restricting production through trick or device,\r\nby plot or conspiracy against competitors, or by oppression of\r\nwage-workers, and then extorting high prices for the commodity it had\r\nmade artificially scarce, it would be prevented from organizing if its\r\nnefarious purpose could be discovered in time, or pursued and suppressed\r\nby all the power of Government whenever found in actual operation. Such\r\na commission, with the power I advocate, would put a stop to abuses of\r\nbig corporations and small corporations alike; it would draw the line on\r\nconduct and not on size; it would destroy monopoly, and make the biggest\r\nbusiness man in the country conform squarely to the principles laid down\r\nby the American people, while at the same time giving fair play to the\r\nlittle man and certainty of knowledge as to what was wrong and what was\r\nright both to big man and little man.\r\n\r\nAlthough under the decision of the courts the National Government had\r\npower over the railways, I found, when I became President, that\r\nthis power was either not exercised at all or exercised with utter\r\ninefficiency. The law against rebates was a dead letter. All the\r\nunscrupulous railway men had been allowed to violate it with impunity;\r\nand because of this, as was inevitable, the scrupulous and decent\r\nrailway men had been forced to violate it themselves, under penalty of\r\nbeing beaten by their less scrupulous rivals. It was not the fault of\r\nthese decent railway men. It was the fault of the Government.\r\n\r\nThanks to a first-class railway man, Paul Morton of the Santa Fe, son of\r\nMr. Cleveland's Secretary of Agriculture, I was able completely to stop\r\nthe practice. Mr. Morton volunteered to aid the Government in abolishing\r\nrebates. He frankly stated that he, like every one else, had been guilty\r\nin the matter; but he insisted that he uttered the sentiments of\r\nthe decent railway men of the country when he said that he hoped the\r\npractice would be stopped, and that if I would really stop it, and not\r\nmerely make believe to stop it, he would give the testimony which would\r\nput into the hands of the Government the power to put a complete check\r\nto the practice. Accordingly he testified, and on the information which\r\nhe gave us we were able to take such action through the Inter-State\r\nCommerce Commission and the Department of Justice, supplemented by\r\nthe necessary additional legislation, that the evil was absolutely\r\neradicated. He thus rendered, of his own accord, at his own personal\r\nrisk, and from purely disinterested motives, an invaluable service to\r\nthe people, a service which no other man who was able to render was\r\nwilling to render. As an immediate sequel, the world-old alliance\r\nbetween Blifil and Black George was immediately revived against Paul\r\nMorton. In giving rebates he had done only what every honest railway\r\nman in the country had been obliged to do because of the failure of the\r\nGovernment to enforce the prohibition as regards dishonest railway\r\nmen. But unlike his fellows he had then shown the courage and sense of\r\nobligation to the public which made him come forward and without\r\nevasion or concealment state what he had done, in order that we might\r\nsuccessfully put an end to the practice; and put an end to the practice\r\nwe did, and we did it because of the courage and patriotism he had\r\nshown. The unscrupulous railway men, whose dishonest practices were\r\nthereby put a stop to, and the unscrupulous demagogues who were either\r\nunder the influence of these men or desirous of gaining credit with\r\nthoughtless and ignorant people no matter who was hurt, joined in\r\nvindictive clamor against Mr. Morton. They actually wished me to\r\nprosecute him, although such prosecution would have been a piece of\r\nunpardonable ingratitude and treachery on the part of the public toward\r\nhim--for I was merely acting as the steward of the public in this\r\nmatter. I need hardly say that I stood by him; and later he served under\r\nme as Secretary of the Navy, and a capital Secretary he made too.\r\n\r\nWe not only secured the stopping of rebates, but in the Hepburn Rate\r\nBill we were able to put through a measure which gave the Inter-State\r\nCommerce Commission for the first time real control over the railways.\r\nThere were two or three amusing features in the contest over this bill.\r\nAll of the great business interests which objected to Governmental\r\ncontrol banded to fight it, and they were helped by the honest men of\r\nultra-conservative type who always dread change, whether good or bad. We\r\nfinally forced it through the House. In the Senate it was referred to\r\na committee in which the Republican majority was under the control of\r\nSenator Aldrich, who took the lead in opposing the bill. There was one\r\nRepublican on the committee, however, whom Senator Aldrich could\r\nnot control--Senator Dolliver, of Iowa. The leading Democrat on the\r\ncommittee was Senator Tillman, of South Carolina, with whom I was not on\r\ngood terms, because I had been obliged to cancel an invitation to him to\r\ndine at the White House on account of his having made a personal assault\r\nin the Senate Chamber on his colleague from South Carolina; and later I\r\nhad to take action against him on account of his conduct in connection\r\nwith certain land matters. Senator Tillman favored the bill. The\r\nRepublican majority in the committee under Senator Aldrich, when they\r\nacted adversely on the bill, turned it over to Senator Tillman, thereby\r\nmaking him its sponsor. The object was to create what it was hoped would\r\nbe an impossible situation in view of the relations between Senator\r\nTillman and myself. I regarded the action as simply childish. It was a\r\ncurious instance of how able and astute men sometimes commit blunders\r\nbecause of sheer inability to understand intensity of disinterested\r\nmotive in others. I did not care a rap about Mr. Tillman's getting\r\ncredit for the bill, or having charge of it. I was delighted to go with\r\nhim or with any one else just so long as he was traveling in my way--and\r\nno longer.\r\n\r\nThere was another amusing incident in connection with the passage of the\r\nbill. All the wise friends of the effort to secure Governmental control\r\nof corporations know that this Government control must be exercised\r\nthrough administrative and not judicial officers if it is to be\r\neffective. Everything possible should be done to minimize the chance\r\nof appealing from the decisions of the administrative officer to the\r\ncourts. But it is not possible Constitutionally, and probably would not\r\nbe desirable anyhow, completely to abolish the appeal. Unwise zealots\r\nwished to make the effort totally to abolish the appeal in connection\r\nwith the Hepburn Bill. Representatives of the special interests wished\r\nto extend the appeal to include what it ought not to include. Between\r\nstood a number of men whose votes would mean the passage of, or the\r\nfailure to pass, the bill, and who were not inclined towards either\r\nside. Three or four substantially identical amendments were proposed,\r\nand we then suddenly found ourselves face to face with an absurd\r\nsituation. The good men who were willing to go with us but had\r\nconservative misgivings about the ultra-radicals would not accept a good\r\namendment if one of the latter proposed it; and the radicals would not\r\naccept their own amendment if one of the conservatives proposed it.\r\nEach side got so wrought up as to be utterly unable to get matters into\r\nproper perspective; each prepared to stand on unimportant trifles; each\r\nannounced with hysterical emphasis--the reformers just as hysterically\r\nas the reactionaries--that the decision as regards each unimportant\r\ntrifle determined the worth or worthlessness of the measure. Gradually\r\nwe secured a measurable return to sane appreciation of the essentials.\r\nFinally both sides reluctantly agreed to accept the so-called Allison\r\namendment which did not, as a matter of fact, work any change in the\r\nbill at all. The amendment was drawn by Attorney-General Moody after\r\nconsultation with the Inter-State Commerce Commission, and was forwarded\r\nby me to Senator Dolliver; it was accepted, and the bill became law.\r\n\r\nThanks to this law and to the way in which the Inter-State Commerce\r\nCommission was backed by the Administration, the Commission, under men\r\nlike Prouty, Lane, and Clark, became a most powerful force for good.\r\nSome of the good that we had accomplished was undone after the close of\r\nmy Administration by the unfortunate law creating a Commerce Court; but\r\nthe major part of the immense advance we had made remained. There was\r\none point on which I insisted, and upon which it is necessary always to\r\ninsist. The Commission cannot do permanent good unless it does justice\r\nto the corporations precisely as it exacts justice from them. The\r\npublic, the shippers, the stock and bondholders, and the employees, all\r\nhave their rights, and none should be allowed unfair privileges at the\r\nexpense of the others. Stock watering and swindling of any kind should\r\nof course not only be stopped but punished. When, however, a road is\r\nmanaged fairly and honestly, and when it renders a real and needed\r\nservice, then the Government must see that it is not so burdened as to\r\nmake it impossible to run it at a profit. There is much wise\r\nlegislation necessary for the safety of the public, or--like workmen's\r\ncompensation--necessary to the well-being of the employee, which\r\nnevertheless imposes such a burden on the road that the burden must be\r\ndistributed between the general public and the corporation, or there\r\nwill be no dividends. In such a case it may be the highest duty of the\r\ncommission to raise rates; and the commission, when satisfied that the\r\nnecessity exists, in order to do justice to the owners of the road,\r\nshould no more hesitate to raise rates, than under other circumstances\r\nto lower them.\r\n\r\nSo much for the \"big stick\" in dealing with the corporations when they\r\nwent wrong. Now for a sample of the square deal.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1907 there were severe business disturbances and\r\nfinancial stringency, culminating in a panic which arose in New York\r\nand spread over the country. The damage actually done was great, and the\r\ndamage threatened was incalculable. Thanks largely to the action of\r\nthe Government, the panic was stopped before, instead of being merely a\r\nserious business check, it became a frightful and Nation-wide calamity,\r\na disaster fraught with untold misery and woe to all our people. For\r\nseveral days the Nation trembled on the brink of such a calamity, of\r\nsuch a disaster.\r\n\r\nDuring these days both the Secretary of the Treasury and I personally\r\nwere in hourly communication with New York, following every change in\r\nthe situation, and trying to anticipate every development. It was\r\nthe obvious duty of the Administration to take every step possible to\r\nprevent appalling disaster by checking the spread of the panic before\r\nit grew so that nothing could check it. And events moved with such\r\nspeed that it was necessary to decide and to act on the instant, as each\r\nsuccessive crisis arose, if the decision and action were to accomplish\r\nanything. The Secretary of the Treasury took various actions, some\r\non his own initiative, some by my direction. Late one evening I was\r\ninformed that two representatives of the Steel Corporation wished to see\r\nme early the following morning, the precise object not being named. Next\r\nmorning, while at breakfast, I was informed that Messrs. Frick and\r\nGary were waiting at the office. I at once went over, and, as the\r\nAttorney-General, Mr. Bonaparte, had not yet arrived from Baltimore,\r\nwhere he had been passing the night, I sent a message asking the\r\nSecretary of State, Mr. Root, who was also a lawyer, to join us, which\r\nhe did. Before the close of the interview and in the presence of the\r\nthree gentlemen named, I dictated a note to Mr. Bonaparte, setting forth\r\nexactly what Messrs. Frick and Gary had proposed, and exactly what I\r\nhad answered--so that there might be no possibility of misunderstanding.\r\nThis note was published in a Senate Document while I was still\r\nPresident. It runs as follows:\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE HOUSE, Washington, November 4, 1907.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Attorney-General:\r\n\r\nJudge E. H. Gary and Mr. H. C. Frick, on behalf of the Steel\r\nCorporation, have just called upon me. They state that there is a\r\ncertain business firm (the name of which I have not been told, but\r\nwhich is of real importance in New York business circles), which will\r\nundoubtedly fail this week if help is not given. Among its assets are\r\na majority of the securities of the Tennessee Coal Company. Application\r\nhas been urgently made to the Steel Corporation to purchase this stock\r\nas the only means of avoiding a failure. Judge Gary and Mr. Frick\r\ninformed me that as a mere business transaction they do not care to\r\npurchase the stock; that under ordinary circumstances they would not\r\nconsider purchasing the stock, because but little benefit will come to\r\nthe Steel Corporation from the purchase; that they are aware that the\r\npurchase will be used as a handle for attack upon them on the ground\r\nthat they are striving to secure a monopoly of the business and prevent\r\ncompetition--not that this would represent what could honestly be said,\r\nbut what might recklessly and untruthfully be said.\r\n\r\nThey further informed me that, as a matter of fact, the policy of the\r\ncompany has been to decline to acquire more than sixty per cent of\r\nthe steel properties, and that this purpose has been persevered in for\r\nseveral years past, with the object of preventing these accusations,\r\nand, as a matter of fact, their proportion of steel properties has\r\nslightly decreased, so that it is below this sixty per cent, and the\r\nacquisition of the property in question will not raise it above sixty\r\nper cent. But they feel that it is immensely to their interest, as to\r\nthe interest of every responsible business man, to try to prevent a\r\npanic and general industrial smash-up at this time, and that they are\r\nwilling to go into this transaction, which they would not otherwise\r\ngo into, because it seems the opinion of those best fitted to express\r\njudgment in New York that it will be an important factor in preventing\r\na break that might be ruinous; and that this has been urged upon them by\r\nthe combination of the most responsible bankers in New York who are now\r\nthus engaged in endeavoring to save the situation. But they asserted\r\nthat they did not wish to do this if I stated that it ought not to be\r\ndone. I answered that, while of course I could not advise them to take\r\nthe action proposed, I felt it no public duty of mine to interpose any\r\nobjections.\r\n\r\nSincerely yours, (Signed) THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\nHON. CHARLES J. BONAPARTE, Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nMr. Bonaparte received this note in about an hour, and that same morning\r\nhe came over, acknowledged its receipt, and said that my answer was the\r\nonly proper answer that could have been made, having regard both to\r\nthe law and to the needs of the situation. He stated that the legal\r\nsituation had been in no way changed, and that no sufficient ground\r\nexisted for prosecution of the Steel Corporation. But I acted purely on\r\nmy own initiative, and the responsibility for the act was solely mine.\r\n\r\nI was intimately acquainted with the situation in New York. The word\r\n\"panic\" means fear, unreasoning fear; to stop a panic it is necessary\r\nto restore confidence; and at the moment the so-called Morgan interests\r\nwere the only interests which retained a full hold on the confidence of\r\nthe people of New York--not only the business people, but the immense\r\nmass of men and women who owned small investments or had small savings\r\nin the banks and trust companies. Mr. Morgan and his associates were\r\nof course fighting hard to prevent the loss of confidence and the panic\r\ndistrust from increasing to such a degree as to bring any other big\r\nfinancial institutions down; for this would probably have been followed\r\nby a general, and very likely a worldwide, crash. The Knickerbocker\r\nTrust Company had already failed, and runs had begun on, or were\r\nthreatened as regards, two other big trust companies. These companies\r\nwere now on the fighting line, and it was to the interest of everybody\r\nto strengthen them, in order that the situation might be saved. It was\r\na matter of general knowledge and belief that they, or the individuals\r\nprominent in them, held the securities of the Tennessee Coal and Iron\r\nCompany, which securities had no market value, and were useless as a\r\nsource of strength in the emergency. The Steel Corporation securities,\r\non the contrary, were immediately marketable, their great value being\r\nknown and admitted all over the world--as the event showed. The proposal\r\nof Messrs. Frick and Gary was that the Steel Corporation should at once\r\nacquire the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company, and thereby substitute,\r\namong the assets of the threatened institutions (which, by the way,\r\nthey did not name to me), securities of great and immediate value for\r\nsecurities which at the moment were of no value. It was necessary for\r\nme to decide on the instant, before the Stock Exchange opened, for the\r\nsituation in New York was such that any hour might be vital, and failure\r\nto act for even an hour might make all subsequent effort to act utterly\r\nuseless. From the best information at my disposal, I believed (what\r\nwas actually the fact) that the addition of the Tennessee Coal and\r\nIron property would only increase the proportion of the Steel Company's\r\nholdings by about four per cent, making them about sixty-two per cent\r\ninstead of about fifty-eight per cent of the total value in the country;\r\nan addition which, by itself, in my judgment (concurred in, not only by\r\nthe Attorney-General but by every competent lawyer), worked no change\r\nin the legal status of the Steel corporation. The diminution in the\r\npercentage of holdings, and production, has gone on steadily, and the\r\npercentage is now about ten per cent less than it was ten years ago.\r\n\r\nThe action was emphatically for the general good. It offered the only\r\nchance for arresting the panic, and it did arrest the panic. I answered\r\nMessrs. Frick and Gary, as set forth in the letter quoted above, to the\r\neffect that I did not deem it my duty to interfere, that is, to forbid\r\nthe action which more than anything else in actual fact saved the\r\nsituation. The result justified my judgment. The panic was stopped,\r\npublic confidence in the solvency of the threatened institution being at\r\nonce restored.\r\n\r\nBusiness was vitally helped by what I did. The benefit was not only\r\nfor the moment. It was permanent. Particularly was this the case in the\r\nSouth. Three or four years afterwards I visited Birmingham. Every man\r\nI met, without exception, who was competent to testify, informed me\r\nvoluntarily that the results of the action taken had been of the utmost\r\nbenefit to Birmingham, and therefore to Alabama, the industry having\r\nprofited to an extraordinary degree, not only from the standpoint of the\r\nbusiness, but from the standpoint of the community at large and of the\r\nwage-workers, by the change in ownership. The results of the action I\r\ntook were beneficial from every standpoint, and the action itself, at\r\nthe time when it was taken, was vitally necessary to the welfare of the\r\npeople of the United States.\r\n\r\nI would have been derelict in my duty, I would have shown myself a timid\r\nand unworthy public servant, if in that extraordinary crisis I had not\r\nacted precisely as I did act. In every such crisis the temptation to\r\nindecision, to non-action, is great, for excuses can always be found for\r\nnon-action, and action means risk and the certainty of blame to the man\r\nwho acts. But if the man is worth his salt he will do his duty, he will\r\ngive the people the benefit of the doubt, and act in any way which\r\ntheir interests demand and which is not affirmatively prohibited by law,\r\nunheeding the likelihood that he himself, when the crisis is over and\r\nthe danger past, will be assailed for what he has done.\r\n\r\nEvery step I took in this matter was open as the day, and was known in\r\ndetail at the moment to all people. The press contained full accounts of\r\nthe visit to me of Messrs. Frick and Gary, and heralded widely and\r\nwith acclamation the results of that visit. At the time the relief and\r\nrejoicing over what had been done were well-nigh universal. The danger\r\nwas too imminent and too appalling for me to be willing to condemn those\r\nwho were successful in saving them from it. But I fully understood and\r\nexpected that when there was no longer danger, when the fear had been\r\nforgotten, attack would be made upon me; and as a matter of fact after\r\na year had elapsed the attack was begun, and has continued at intervals\r\never since; my ordinary assailant being some politician of rather cheap\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nIf I were on a sail-boat, I should not ordinarily meddle with any of the\r\ngear; but if a sudden squall struck us, and the main sheet jammed, so\r\nthat the boat threatened to capsize, I would unhesitatingly cut the main\r\nsheet, even though I were sure that the owner, no matter how grateful\r\nto me at the moment for having saved his life, would a few weeks later,\r\nwhen he had forgotten his danger and his fear, decide to sue me for the\r\nvalue of the cut rope. But I would feel a hearty contempt for the owner\r\nwho so acted.\r\n\r\nThere were many other things that we did in connection with\r\ncorporations. One of the most important was the passage of the meat\r\ninspection law because of scandalous abuses shown to exist in the great\r\npacking-houses in Chicago and elsewhere. There was a curious result of\r\nthis law, similar to what occurred in connection with the law providing\r\nfor effective railway regulation. The big beef men bitterly opposed the\r\nlaw; just as the big railway men opposed the Hepburn Act. Yet three\r\nor four years after these laws had been put on the statute books every\r\nhonest man both in the beef business and the railway business came to\r\nthe conclusion that they worked good and not harm to the decent business\r\nconcerns. They hurt only those who were not acting as they should have\r\nacted. The law providing for the inspection of packing-houses, and the\r\nPure Food and Drugs Act, were also extremely important; and the way in\r\nwhich they were administered was even more important. It would be hard\r\nto overstate the value of the service rendered in all these cases\r\nby such cabinet officers as Moody and Bonaparte, and their outside\r\nassistants of the stamp of Frank Kellogg.\r\n\r\nIt would be useless to enumerate all the suits we brought. Some of\r\nthem I have already touched upon. Others, such as the suits against the\r\nHarriman railway corporations, which were successful, and which had\r\nbeen rendered absolutely necessary by the grossly improper action of the\r\ncorporations concerned, offered no special points of interest. The Sugar\r\nTrust proceedings, however, may be mentioned as showing just the kind of\r\nthing that was done and the kind of obstacle encountered and overcome in\r\nprosecutions of this character.\r\n\r\nIt was on the advice of my secretary, William Loeb, Jr., afterward head\r\nof the New York Custom-House, that the action was taken which started\r\nthe uncovering of the frauds perpetrated by the Sugar Trust and other\r\ncompanies in connection with the importing of sugar. Loeb had from time\r\nto time told me that he was sure that there was fraud in connection with\r\nthe importations by the Sugar Trust through the New York Custom-House.\r\nFinally, some time toward the end of 1904, he informed me that Richard\r\nParr, a sampler at the New York Appraisers' Stores (whose duties took\r\nhim almost continually on the docks in connection with the sampling of\r\nmerchandise), had called on him, and had stated that in his belief the\r\nsugar companies were defrauding the Government in the matter of weights,\r\nand had stated that if he could be made an investigating officer of\r\nthe Treasury Department, he was confident that he could show there was\r\nwrongdoing. Parr had been a former school fellow of Loeb in Albany, and\r\nLoeb believed him to be loyal, honest, and efficient. He thereupon laid\r\nthe matter before me, and advised the appointment of Parr as a special\r\nemployee of the Treasury Department, for the specific purpose of\r\ninvestigating the alleged sugar frauds. I instructed the Treasury\r\nDepartment accordingly, and was informed that there was no vacancy in\r\nthe force of special employees, but that Parr would be given the first\r\nplace that opened up. Early in the spring of 1905 Parr came to Loeb\r\nagain, and said that he had received additional information about the\r\nsugar frauds, and was anxious to begin the investigation. Loeb again\r\ndiscussed the matter with me; and I notified the Treasury Department to\r\nappoint Parr immediately. On June 1, 1905, he received his appointment,\r\nand was assigned to the port of Boston for the purpose of gaining\r\nsome experience as an investigating officer. During the month he was\r\ntransferred to the Maine District, with headquarters at Portland, where\r\nhe remained until March, 1907. During his service in Maine he uncovered\r\nextensive wool smuggling frauds. At the conclusion of the wool case, he\r\nappealed to Loeb to have him transferred to New York, so that he might\r\nundertake the investigation of the sugar underweighing frauds. I now\r\ncalled the attention of Secretary Cortelyou personally to the matter,\r\nso that he would be able to keep a check over any subordinates who might\r\ntry to interfere with Parr, for the conspiracy was evidently widespread,\r\nthe wealth of the offenders great, and the corruption in the service\r\nfar-reaching--while moreover as always happens with \"respectable\"\r\noffenders, there were many good men who sincerely disbelieved in the\r\npossibility of corruption on the part of men of such high financial\r\nstanding. Parr was assigned to New York early in March, 1907, and at\r\nonce began an active investigation of the conditions existing on the\r\nsugar docks. This terminated in the discovery of a steel spring in one\r\nof the scales of the Havemeyer & Elder docks in Brooklyn, November 20,\r\n1907, which enabled us to uncover what were probably the most colossal\r\nfrauds ever perpetrated in the Customs Service. From the beginning of\r\nhis active work in the investigation of the sugar frauds in March, 1907,\r\nto March 4, 1909, Parr, from time to time, personally reported to Loeb,\r\nat the White House, the progress of his investigations, and Loeb in his\r\nturn kept me personally advised. On one occasion there was an attempt\r\nmade to shunt Parr off the investigation and substitute another agent of\r\nthe Treasury, who was suspected of having some relations with the sugar\r\ncompanies under investigation; but Parr reported the facts to Loeb,\r\nI sent for Secretary Cortelyou, and Secretary Cortelyou promptly took\r\ncharge of the matter himself, putting Parr back on the investigation.\r\n\r\nDuring the investigation Parr was subjected to all sorts of harassments,\r\nincluding an attempt to bribe him by Spitzer, the dock superintendent\r\nof the Havemeyer & Elder Refinery, for which Spitzer was convicted and\r\nserved a term in prison. Brzezinski, a special agent, who was assisting\r\nParr, was convicted of perjury and also served a term in prison, he\r\nhaving changed his testimony, in the trial of Spitzer for the attempted\r\nbribery of Parr, from that which he gave before the Grand Jury. For his\r\nextraordinary services in connection with this investigation Parr was\r\ngranted an award of $100,000 by the Treasury Department.\r\n\r\nDistrict-Attorney Stimson, of New York, assisted by Denison,\r\nFrankfurter, Wise, and other employees of the Department of Justice,\r\ntook charge of the case, and carried on both civil and criminal\r\nproceedings. The trial in the action against the Sugar Trust, for the\r\nrecovery of duties on the cargo of sugar, which was being sent over the\r\nscales at the time of the discovery of the steel spring by Parr, was\r\nbegun in 1908; judgment was rendered against the defendants on March\r\n5, 1909, the day after I left office. Over four million dollars were\r\nrecovered and paid back into the United States Treasury by the sugar\r\ncompanies which had perpetrated the various forms of fraud. These frauds\r\nwere unearthed by Parr, Loeb, Stimson, Frankfurter, and the other men\r\nmentioned and their associates, and it was to them that the people owed\r\nthe refunding of the huge sum of money mentioned. We had already secured\r\nheavy fines from the Sugar Trust, and from various big railways, and\r\nprivate individuals, such as Edwin Earle, for unlawful rebates. In the\r\ncase of the chief offender, the American Sugar Refining Company (the\r\nSugar Trust), criminal prosecutions were carried on against every living\r\nman whose position was such that he would naturally know about the\r\nfraud. All of them were indicted, and the biggest and most responsible\r\nones were convicted. The evidence showed that the president of the\r\ncompany, Henry O. Havemeyer, virtually ran the entire company, and was\r\nresponsible for all the details of the management. He died two weeks\r\nafter the fraud was discovered, just as proceedings were being begun.\r\nNext to him in importance was the secretary and treasurer, Charles R.\r\nHeike, who was convicted. Various other officials and employees of the\r\nTrust, and various Government employees, were indicted, and most of\r\nthem convicted. Ernest W. Gerbracht, the superintendent of one of the\r\nrefineries, was convicted, but his sentence was commuted to a short\r\njail imprisonment, because he became a Government witness and greatly\r\nassisted the Government in the suits.\r\n\r\nHeike's sentence was commuted so as to excuse him from going to the\r\npenitentiary; just as the penitentiary sentence of Morse, the big New\r\nYork banker, who was convicted of gross fraud and misapplication of\r\nfunds, was commuted. Both commutations were granted long after I left\r\noffice. In each case the commutation was granted because, as was stated,\r\nof the prisoner's age and state of health. In Morse's case the President\r\noriginally refused the request, saying that Morse had exhibited\r\n\"fraudulent and criminal disregard of the trust imposed upon him,\" that\r\n\"he was entirely unscrupulous as to the methods he adopted,\" and\r\n\"that he seemed at times to be absolutely heartless with regard to the\r\nconsequences to others, and he showed great shrewdness in obtaining\r\nlarge sums of money from the bank without adequate security and without\r\nmaking himself personally liable therefor.\" The two cases may be\r\nconsidered in connection with the announcement in the public press that\r\non May 17, 1913, the President commuted the sentence of Lewis A. Banks,\r\nwho was serving a very long term penitentiary sentence for an attack on\r\na girl in the Indian Territory; \"the reason for the commutation which is\r\nset forth in the press being that 'Banks is in poor health.'\"\r\n\r\nIt is no easy matter to balance the claims of justice and mercy in such\r\ncases. In these three cases, of all of which I had personal cognizance,\r\nI disagreed radically with the views my successors took, and with the\r\nviews which many respectable men took who in these and similar cases,\r\nboth while I was in office and afterward, urged me to show, or to ask\r\nothers to show, clemency. It then seemed to me, and it now seems to me,\r\nthat such clemency is from the larger standpoint a gross wrong to the\r\nmen and women of the country.\r\n\r\nOne of the former special assistants of the district-attorney, Mr. W.\r\nCleveland Runyon, in commenting bitterly on the release of Heike\r\nand Morse on account of their health, pointed out that their health\r\napparently became good when once they themselves became free men, and\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n\"The commutation of these sentences amounts to a direct interference\r\nwith the administration of justice by the courts. Heike got a $25,000\r\nsalary and has escaped his imprisonment, but what about the six $18 a\r\nweek checkers, who were sent to jail, one of them a man of more than\r\nsixty? It is cases like this that create discontent and anarchy. They\r\nmake it seem plain that there is one law for the rich and another for\r\nthe poor man, and I for one will protest.\"\r\n\r\nIn dealing with Heike the individual (or Morse or any other individual),\r\nit is necessary to emphasize the social aspects of his case. The moral\r\nof the Heike case, as has been well said, is \"how easy it is for a man\r\nin modern corporate organization to drift into wrongdoing.\" The\r\nmoral restraints are loosened in the case of a man like Heike by\r\nthe insulation of himself from the sordid details of crime, through\r\nindustrially coerced intervening agents. Professor Ross has made the\r\npenetrating observation that \"distance disinfects dividends\"; it also\r\nweakens individual responsibility, particularly on the part of the very\r\nmanagers of large business, who should feel it most acutely. One of the\r\nofficers of the Department of Justice who conducted the suit, and who\r\ninclined to the side of mercy in the matter, nevertheless writes: \"Heike\r\nis a beautiful illustration of mental and moral obscuration in the\r\nbusiness life of an otherwise valuable member of society. Heike had\r\nan ample share in the guidance of the affairs of the American Sugar\r\nCompany, and we are apt to have a foreshortened picture of his\r\nresponsibility, because he operated from the easy coign of vantage of\r\nexecutive remoteness. It is difficult to say to what extent he did,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, profit by the sordid practices of his company.\r\nBut the social damage of an individual in his position may be just as\r\ndeep, whether merely the zest of the game or hard cash be his dominant\r\nmotive.\"\r\n\r\nI have coupled the cases of the big banker and the Sugar Trust official\r\nand the case of the man convicted of a criminal assault on a woman. All\r\nof the criminals were released from penitentiary sentences on grounds of\r\nill health. The offenses were typical of the worst crimes committed\r\nat the two ends of the social scale. One offense was a crime of brutal\r\nviolence; the other offenses were crimes of astute corruption. All of\r\nthem were offenses which in my judgment were of such a character that\r\nclemency towards the offender worked grave injustice to the community\r\nas a whole, injustice so grave that its effects might be far-reaching in\r\ntheir damage.\r\n\r\nEvery time that rape or criminal assault on a woman is pardoned, and\r\nanything less than the full penalty of the law exacted, a premium is\r\nput on the practice of lynching such offenders. Every time a big moneyed\r\noffender, who naturally excites interest and sympathy, and who has\r\nmany friends, is excused from serving a sentence which a man of less\r\nprominence and fewer friends would have to serve, justice is discredited\r\nin the eyes of plain people--and to undermine faith in justice is to\r\nstrike at the foundation of the Republic. As for ill health, it must\r\nbe remembered that few people are as healthy in prison as they would be\r\noutside; and there should be no discrimination among criminals on this\r\nscore; either all criminals who grow unhealthy should be let out, or\r\nnone. Pardons must sometimes be given in order that the cause of justice\r\nmay be served; but in cases such as these I am considering, while I know\r\nthat many amiable people differ from me, I am obliged to say that in my\r\njudgment the pardons work far-reaching harm to the cause of justice.\r\n\r\nAmong the big corporations themselves, even where they did wrong, there\r\nwas a wide difference in the moral obliquity indicated by the wrongdoer.\r\nThere was a wide distinction between the offenses committed in the case\r\nof the Northern Securities Company, and the offenses because of which\r\nthe Sugar Trust, the Tobacco Trust, and the Standard Oil Trust were\r\nsuccessfully prosecuted under my Administration. It was vital to destroy\r\nthe Northern Securities Company; but the men creating it had done so in\r\nopen and above-board fashion, acting under what they, and most of the\r\nmembers of the bar, thought to be the law established by the Supreme\r\nCourt in the Knight sugar case. But the Supreme Court in its decree\r\ndissolving the Standard Oil and Tobacco Trusts, condemned them in the\r\nseverest language for moral turpitude; and an even severer need of\r\ncondemnation should be visited on the Sugar Trust.\r\n\r\nHowever, all the trusts and big corporations against which we\r\nproceeded--which included in their directorates practically all the\r\nbiggest financiers in the country--joined in making the bitterest\r\nassaults on me and on my Administration. Of their actions I wrote as\r\nfollows to Attorney-General Bonaparte, who had been a peculiarly close\r\nfriend and adviser through the period covered by my public life in high\r\noffice and who, together with Attorney-General Moody, possessed the same\r\nunderstanding sympathy with my social and industrial program that\r\nwas possessed by such officials as Straus, Garfield, H. K. Smith, and\r\nPinchot. The letter runs:\r\n\r\nJanuary 2, 1908.\r\n\r\nMy dear Bonaparte:\r\n\r\nI must congratulate you on your admirable speech at Chicago. You said\r\nthe very things it was good to say at this time. What you said bore\r\nespecial weight because it represented what you had done. You have shown\r\nby what you have actually accomplished that the law is enforced against\r\nthe wealthiest corporation, and the richest and most powerful manager\r\nor manipulator of that corporation, just as resolutely and fearlessly as\r\nagainst the humblest citizen. The Department of Justice is now in very\r\nfact the Department of Justice, and justice is meted out with an even\r\nhand to great and small, rich and poor, weak and strong. Those who have\r\ndenounced you and the action of the Department of Justice are either\r\nmisled, or else are the very wrongdoers, and the agents of the very\r\nwrongdoers, who have for so many years gone scot-free and flouted the\r\nlaws with impunity. Above all, you are to be congratulated upon the\r\nbitterness felt and expressed towards you by the representatives and\r\nagents of the great law-defying corporations of immense wealth, who,\r\nuntil within the last half-dozen years, have treated themselves and have\r\nexpected others to treat them as being beyond and above all possible\r\ncheck from law.\r\n\r\nIt was time to say something, for the representatives of predatory\r\nwealth, of wealth accumulated on a giant scale by iniquity,\r\nby wrongdoing in many forms, by plain swindling, by oppressing\r\nwage-workers, by manipulating securities, by unfair and unwholesome\r\ncompetition and by stock-jobbing,--in short, by conduct abhorrent to\r\nevery man of ordinarily decent conscience, have during the last few\r\nmonths made it evident that they are banded together to work for a\r\nreaction, to endeavor to overthrow and discredit all who honestly\r\nadminister the law, and to secure a return to the days when every\r\nunscrupulous wrongdoer could do what he wished unchecked, provided he\r\nhad enough money. They attack you because they know your honesty and\r\nfearlessness, and dread them. The enormous sums of money these men have\r\nat their control enable them to carry on an effective campaign. They\r\nfind their tools in a portion of the public press, including especially\r\ncertain of the great New York newspapers. They find their agents in\r\nsome men in public life,--now and then occupying, or having occupied,\r\npositions as high as Senator or Governor,--in some men in the pulpit,\r\nand most melancholy of all, in a few men on the bench. By gifts to\r\ncolleges and universities they are occasionally able to subsidize in\r\ntheir own interest some head of an educational body, who, save only a\r\njudge, should of all men be most careful to keep his skirts clear from\r\nthe taint of such corruption. There are ample material rewards for those\r\nwho serve with fidelity the Mammon of unrighteousness, but they are\r\ndearly paid for by that institution of learning whose head, by example\r\nand precept, teaches the scholars who sit under him that there is one\r\nlaw for the rich and another for the poor. The amount of money the\r\nrepresentatives of the great moneyed interests are willing to spend can\r\nbe gauged by their recent publication broadcast throughout the papers\r\nof this country from the Atlantic to the Pacific of huge advertisements,\r\nattacking with envenomed bitterness the Administration's policy of\r\nwarring against successful dishonesty, advertisements that must have\r\ncost enormous sums of money. This advertisement, as also a pamphlet\r\ncalled \"The Roosevelt Panic,\" and one or two similar books and\r\npamphlets, are written especially in the interest of the Standard Oil\r\nand Harriman combinations, but also defend all the individuals and\r\ncorporations of great wealth that have been guilty of wrongdoing. From\r\nthe railroad rate law to the pure food law, every measure for honesty\r\nin business that has been pressed during the last six years, has been\r\nopposed by these men, on its passage and in its administration, with\r\nevery resource that bitter and unscrupulous craft could suggest, and the\r\ncommand of almost unlimited money secure. These men do not themselves\r\nspeak or write; they hire others to do their bidding. Their spirit and\r\npurpose are made clear alike by the editorials of the papers owned in,\r\nor whose policy is dictated by, Wall Street, and by the speeches of\r\npublic men who, as Senators, Governors, or Mayors, have served these\r\ntheir masters to the cost of the plain people. At one time one of their\r\nwriters or speakers attacks the rate law as the cause of the panic; he\r\nis, whether in public life or not, usually a clever corporation lawyer,\r\nand he is not so foolish a being as to believe in the truth of what he\r\nsays; he has too closely represented the railroads not to know well that\r\nthe Hepburn Rate Bill has helped every honest railroad, and has hurt\r\nonly the railroads that regarded themselves as above the law. At another\r\ntime, one of them assails the Administration for not imprisoning people\r\nunder the Sherman Anti-Trust Law; for declining to make what he well\r\nknows, in view of the actual attitude of juries (as shown in the Tobacco\r\nTrust cases and in San Francisco in one or two of the cases brought\r\nagainst corrupt business men) would have been the futile endeavor to\r\nimprison defendants whom we are actually able to fine. He raises the\r\nusual clamor, raised by all who object to the enforcement of the law,\r\nthat we are fining corporations instead of putting the heads of the\r\ncorporations in jail; and he states that this does not really harm the\r\nchief offenders. Were this statement true, he himself would not be found\r\nattacking us. The extraordinary violence of the assault upon our policy\r\ncontained in speeches like these, in the articles in the subsidized\r\npress, in such huge advertisements and pamphlets as those above referred\r\nto, and the enormous sums of money spent in these various ways, give a\r\nfairly accurate measure of the anger and terror which our actions have\r\ncaused the corrupt men of vast wealth to feel in the very marrow of\r\ntheir being.\r\n\r\nThe man thus attacking us is usually, like so many of his fellows,\r\neither a great lawyer, or a paid editor who takes his commands from the\r\nfinanciers and his arguments from their attorneys. If the former, he has\r\ndefended many malefactors, and he knows well that, thanks to the advice\r\nof lawyers like himself, a certain kind of modern corporation has been\r\nturned into an admirable instrument by which to render it well nigh\r\nimpossible to get at the really guilty man, so that in most cases the\r\nonly way of punishing the wrong is by fining the corporation or by\r\nproceeding personally against some of the minor agents. These lawyers\r\nand their employers are the men mainly responsible for this state of\r\nthings, and their responsibility is shared with the legislators who\r\ningeniously oppose the passing of just and effective laws, and with\r\nthose judges whose one aim seems to be to construe such laws so that\r\nthey cannot be executed. Nothing is sillier than this outcry on behalf\r\nof the \"innocent stockholders\" in the corporations. We are besought to\r\npity the Standard Oil Company for a fine relatively far less great than\r\nthe fines every day inflicted in the police courts upon multitudes of\r\npush cart peddlers and other petty offenders, whose woes never extort\r\none word from the men whose withers are wrung by the woes of the mighty.\r\nThe stockholders have the control of the corporation in their own hands.\r\nThe corporation officials are elected by those holding the majority of\r\nthe stock and can keep office only by having behind them the good-will\r\nof these majority stockholders. They are not entitled to the slightest\r\npity if they deliberately choose to resign into the hands of great\r\nwrongdoers the control of the corporations in which they own the stock.\r\nOf course innocent people have become involved in these big corporations\r\nand suffer because of the misdeeds of their criminal associates. Let\r\nthese innocent people be careful not to invest in corporations where\r\nthose in control are not men of probity, men who respect the laws; above\r\nall let them avoid the men who make it their one effort to evade or defy\r\nthe laws. But if these honest innocent people are in the majority in\r\nany corporation they can immediately resume control and throw out of\r\nthe directory the men who misrepresent them. Does any man for a moment\r\nsuppose that the majority stockholders of the Standard Oil are others\r\nthan Mr. Rockefeller and his associates themselves and the beneficiaries\r\nof their wrongdoing? When the stock is watered so that the innocent\r\ninvestors suffer, a grave wrong is indeed done to these innocent\r\ninvestors as well as to the public; but the public men, lawyers and\r\neditors, to whom I refer, do not under these circumstances express\r\nsympathy for the innocent; on the contrary they are the first to protest\r\nwith frantic vehemence against our efforts by law to put a stop to\r\nover-capitalization and stock-watering. The apologists of successful\r\ndishonesty always declaim against any effort to punish or prevent it on\r\nthe ground that such effort will \"unsettle business.\" It is they who by\r\ntheir acts have unsettled business; and the very men raising this\r\ncry spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in securing, by speech,\r\neditorial, book or pamphlet, the defense by misstatement of what they\r\nhave done; and yet when we correct their misstatements by telling the\r\ntruth, they declaim against us for breaking silence, lest \"values be\r\nunsettled!\" They have hurt honest business men, honest working men,\r\nhonest farmers; and now they clamor against the truth being told.\r\n\r\nThe keynote of all these attacks upon the effort to secure honesty in\r\nbusiness and in politics, is expressed in a recent speech, in which the\r\nspeaker stated that prosperity had been checked by the effort for the\r\n\"moral regeneration of the business world,\" an effort which he denounced\r\nas \"unnatural, unwarranted, and injurious\" and for which he stated the\r\npanic was the penalty. The morality of such a plea is precisely as great\r\nas if made on behalf of the men caught in a gambling establishment when\r\nthat gambling establishment is raided by the police. If such words mean\r\nanything they mean that those whose sentiments they represent stand\r\nagainst the effort to bring about a moral regeneration of business which\r\nwill prevent a repetition of the insurance, banking, and street railroad\r\nscandals in New York; a repetition of the Chicago and Alton deal; a\r\nrepetition of the combination between certain professional politicians,\r\ncertain professional labor leaders and certain big financiers from the\r\ndisgrace of which San Francisco has just been rescued; a repetition of\r\nthe successful efforts by the Standard Oil people to crush out every\r\ncompetitor, to overawe the common carriers, and to establish a monopoly\r\nwhich treats the public with the contempt which the public deserves so\r\nlong as it permits men like the public men of whom I speak to represent\r\nit in politics, men like the heads of colleges to whom I refer to\r\neducate its youth. The outcry against stopping dishonest practices among\r\nthe very wealthy is precisely similar to the outcry raised against every\r\neffort for cleanliness and decency in city government because, forsooth,\r\nit will \"hurt business.\" The same outcry is made against the Department\r\nof Justice for prosecuting the heads of colossal corporations that is\r\nmade against the men who in San Francisco are prosecuting with impartial\r\nseverity the wrongdoers among business men, public officials, and labor\r\nleaders alike. The principle is the same in the two cases. Just as\r\nthe blackmailer and the bribe giver stand on the same evil eminence\r\nof infamy, so the man who makes an enormous fortune by corrupting\r\nLegislatures and municipalities and fleecing his stockholders and the\r\npublic stands on a level with the creature who fattens on the blood\r\nmoney of the gambling house, the saloon and the brothel. Moreover,\r\nboth kinds of corruption in the last analysis are far more intimately\r\nconnected than would at first sight appear; the wrong-doing is at bottom\r\nthe same. Corrupt business and corrupt politics act and react, with\r\never increasing debasement, one on the other; the rebate-taker, the\r\nfranchise-trafficker, the manipulator of securities, the purveyor and\r\nprotector of vice, the black-mailing ward boss, the ballot box stuffer,\r\nthe demagogue, the mob leader, the hired bully and mankiller, all alike\r\nwork at the same web of corruption, and all alike should be abhorred by\r\nhonest men.\r\n\r\nThe \"business\" which is hurt by the movement for honesty is the kind of\r\nbusiness which, in the long run, it pays the country to have hurt. It\r\nis the kind of business which has tended to make the very name \"high\r\nfinance\" a term of scandal to which all honest American men of business\r\nshould join in putting an end. One of the special pleaders for business\r\ndishonesty, in a recent speech, in denouncing the Administration for\r\nenforcing the law against the huge and corrupt corporations which\r\nhave defied the law, also denounced it for endeavoring to secure\r\na far-reaching law making employers liable for injuries to their\r\nemployees. It is meet and fit that the apologists for corrupt wealth\r\nshould oppose every effort to relieve weak and helpless people from\r\ncrushing misfortune brought upon them by injury in the business from\r\nwhich they gain a bare livelihood and their employers fortunes. It is\r\nhypocritical baseness to speak of a girl who works in a factory where\r\nthe dangerous machinery is unprotected as having the \"right\" freely\r\nto contract to expose herself to dangers to life and limb. She has\r\nno alternative but to suffer want or else to expose herself to such\r\ndangers, and when she loses a hand or is otherwise maimed or disfigured\r\nfor life it is a moral wrong that the burden of the risk necessarily\r\nincidental to the business should be placed with crushing weight upon\r\nher weak shoulders and the man who has profited by her work escape\r\nscot-free. This is what our opponents advocate, and it is proper that\r\nthey should advocate it, for it rounds out their advocacy of those most\r\ndangerous members of the criminal class, the criminals of vast wealth,\r\nthe men who can afford best to pay for such championship in the press\r\nand on the stump.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to speak about the judges, for it behooves us all to\r\ntreat with the utmost respect the high office of judge; and our judges\r\nas a whole are brave and upright men. But there is need that those who\r\ngo wrong should not be allowed to feel that there is no condemnation of\r\ntheir wrongdoing. A judge who on the bench either truckles to the mob or\r\nbows down before a corporation; or who, having left the bench to become\r\na corporation lawyer, seeks to aid his clients by denouncing as enemies\r\nof property all those who seek to stop the abuses of the criminal rich;\r\nsuch a man performs an even worse service to the body politic than the\r\nLegislator or Executive who goes wrong. In no way can respect for the\r\ncourts be so quickly undermined as by teaching the public through the\r\naction of a judge himself that there is reason for the loss of such\r\nrespect. The judge who by word or deed makes it plain that the corrupt\r\ncorporation, the law-defying corporation, the law-defying rich man,\r\nhas in him a sure and trustworthy ally, the judge who by misuse of the\r\nprocess of injunction makes it plain that in him the wage-worker has a\r\ndetermined and unscrupulous enemy, the judge who when he decides in an\r\nemployers' liability or a tenement house factory case shows that he has\r\nneither sympathy for nor understanding of those fellow-citizens of his\r\nwho most need his sympathy and understanding; these judges work as much\r\nevil as if they pandered to the mob, as if they shrank from sternly\r\nrepressing violence and disorder. The judge who does his full duty well\r\nstands higher, and renders a better service to the people, than any\r\nother public servant; he is entitled to greater respect; and if he is a\r\ntrue servant of the people, if he is upright, wise and fearless, he will\r\nunhesitatingly disregard even the wishes of the people if they conflict\r\nwith the eternal principles of right as against wrong. He must serve\r\nthe people; but he must serve his conscience first. All honor to such a\r\njudge; and all honor cannot be rendered him if it is rendered equally\r\nto his brethren who fall immeasurably below the high ideals for which he\r\nstands. There should be a sharp discrimination against such judges. They\r\nclaim immunity from criticism, and the claim is heatedly advanced by men\r\nand newspapers like those of whom I speak. Most certainly they can claim\r\nimmunity from untruthful criticism; and their champions, the newspapers\r\nand the public men I have mentioned, exquisitely illustrate by their own\r\nactions mendacious criticism in its most flagrant and iniquitous form.\r\n\r\nBut no servant of the people has a right to expect to be free from just\r\nand honest criticism. It is the newspapers, and the public men whose\r\nthoughts and deeds show them to be most alien to honesty and truth\r\nwho themselves loudly object to truthful and honest criticism of their\r\nfellow-servants of the great moneyed interests.\r\n\r\nWe have no quarrel with the individuals, whether public men, lawyers\r\nor editors, to whom I refer. These men derive their sole power from the\r\ngreat, sinister offenders who stand behind them. They are but puppets\r\nwho move as the strings are pulled by those who control the enormous\r\nmasses of corporate wealth which if itself left uncontrolled threatens\r\ndire evil to the Republic. It is not the puppets, but the strong,\r\ncunning men and the mighty forces working for evil behind, and to a\r\ncertain extent through, the puppets, with whom we have to deal. We seek\r\nto control law-defying wealth, in the first place to prevent its\r\ndoing evil, and in the next place to avoid the vindictive and dreadful\r\nradicalism which if left uncontrolled it is certain in the end to\r\narouse. Sweeping attacks upon all property, upon all men of means,\r\nwithout regard to whether they do well or ill, would sound the death\r\nknell of the Republic; and such attacks become inevitable if decent\r\ncitizens permit rich men whose lives are corrupt and evil to domineer\r\nin swollen pride, unchecked and unhindered, over the destinies of this\r\ncountry. We act in no vindictive spirit, and we are no respecters of\r\npersons. If a labor union does what is wrong, we oppose it as fearlessly\r\nas we oppose a corporation that does wrong; and we stand with equal\r\nstoutness for the rights of the man of wealth and for the rights of the\r\nwage-workers; just as much so for one as for the other. We seek to stop\r\nwrongdoing; and we desire to punish the wrongdoer only so far as is\r\nnecessary in order to achieve this end. We are the stanch upholders of\r\nevery honest man, whether business man or wage-worker.\r\n\r\nI do not for a moment believe that our actions have brought on business\r\ndistress; so far as this is due to local and not world-wide causes,\r\nand to the actions of any particular individuals, it is due to the\r\nspeculative folly and flagrant dishonesty of a few men of great\r\nwealth, who now seek to shield themselves from the effects of their own\r\nwrongdoings by ascribing its results to the actions of those who have\r\nsought to put a stop to the wrongdoing. But if it were true that to\r\ncut out rottenness from the body politic meant a momentary check to an\r\nunhealthy seeming prosperity, I should not for one moment hesitate to\r\nput the knife to the cancer. On behalf of all our people, on behalf no\r\nless of the honest man of means than of the honest man who earns each\r\nday's livelihood by that day's sweat of his brow, it is necessary to\r\ninsist upon honesty in business and politics alike, in all walks of\r\nlife, in big things and in little things; upon just and fair dealing\r\nas between man and man. We are striving for the right in the spirit of\r\nAbraham Lincoln when he said:\r\n\r\n\"Fondly do we hope--fervently do we pray--that this mighty scourge may\r\nspeedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the\r\nwealth piled by the bondsmen's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited\r\ntoil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the\r\nlash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three\r\nthousand years ago, so still it must be said, 'The judgments of the Lord\r\nare true and righteous altogether.'\r\n\r\n\"With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the\r\nright, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the\r\nwork we are in.\"\r\n\r\nSincerely yours, THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\nHON. CHARLES J. BONAPARTE. Attorney-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nSOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL JUSTICE\r\n\r\nBy the time I became President I had grown to feel with deep intensity\r\nof conviction that governmental agencies must find their justification\r\nlargely in the way in which they are used for the practical betterment\r\nof living and working conditions among the mass of the people. I felt\r\nthat the fight was really for the abolition of privilege; and one of the\r\nfirst stages in the battle was necessarily to fight for the rights of\r\nthe workingman. For this reason I felt most strongly that all that the\r\ngovernment could do in the interest of labor should be done. The Federal\r\nGovernment can rarely act with the directness that the State governments\r\nact. It can, however, do a good deal. My purpose was to make the\r\nNational Government itself a model employer of labor, the effort being\r\nto make the per diem employee just as much as the Cabinet officer regard\r\nhimself as one of the partners employed in the service of the public,\r\nproud of his work, eager to do it in the best possible manner, and\r\nconfident of just treatment. Our aim was also to secure good laws\r\nwherever the National Government had power, notably in the Territories,\r\nin the District of Columbia, and in connection with inter-State\r\ncommerce. I found the eight-hour law a mere farce, the departments\r\nrarely enforcing it with any degree of efficiency. This I remedied\r\nby executive action. Unfortunately, thoroughly efficient government\r\nservants often proved to be the prime offenders so far as the\r\nenforcement of the eight-hour law was concerned, because in their zeal\r\nto get good work done for the Government they became harsh taskmasters,\r\nand declined to consider the needs of their fellow-employees who served\r\nunder them. The more I had studied the subject the more strongly I had\r\nbecome convinced that an eight-hour day under the conditions of labor\r\nin the United States was all that could, with wisdom and propriety, be\r\nrequired either by the Government or by private employers; that more\r\nthan this meant, on the average, a decrease in the qualities that tell\r\nfor good citizenship. I finally solved the problem, as far as Government\r\nemployees were concerned, by calling in Charles P. Neill, the head\r\nof the Labor Bureau; and acting on his advice, I speedily made the\r\neight-hour law really effective. Any man who shirked his work, who\r\ndawdled and idled, received no mercy; slackness is even worse than\r\nharshness; for exactly as in battle mercy to the coward is cruelty to\r\nthe brave man, so in civil life slackness towards the vicious and idle\r\nis harshness towards the honest and hardworking.\r\n\r\nWe passed a good law protecting the lives and health of miners in the\r\nTerritories, and other laws providing for the supervision of employment\r\nagencies in the District of Columbia, and protecting the health\r\nof motormen and conductors on street railways in the District. We\r\npractically started the Bureau of Mines. We provided for safeguarding\r\nfactory employees in the District against accidents, and for the\r\nrestriction of child labor therein. We passed a workmen's compensation\r\nlaw for the protection of Government employees; a law which did not\r\ngo as far as I wished, but which was the best I could get, and which\r\ncommitted the Government to the right policy. We provided for an\r\ninvestigation of woman and child labor in the United States. We\r\nincorporated the National Child Labor Committee. Where we had most\r\ndifficulty was with the railway companies engaged in inter-State\r\nbusiness. We passed an act improving safety appliances on railway trains\r\nwithout much opposition, but we had more trouble with acts regulating\r\nthe hours of labor of railway employees and making those railways which\r\nwere engaged in inter-State commerce liable for injuries to or the death\r\nof their employees while on duty. One important step in connection with\r\nthese latter laws was taken by Attorney-General Moody when, on behalf of\r\nthe Government, he intervened in the case of a wronged employee. It\r\nis unjust that a law which has been declared public policy by the\r\nrepresentatives of the people should be submitted to the possibility of\r\nnullification because the Government leaves the enforcement of it to the\r\nprivate initiative of poor people who have just suffered some crushing\r\naccident. It should be the business of the Government to enforce laws of\r\nthis kind, and to appear in court to argue for their constitutionality\r\nand proper enforcement. Thanks to Moody, the Government assumed this\r\nposition. The first employers' liability law affecting inter-State\r\nrailroads was declared unconstitutional. We got through another, which\r\nstood the test of the courts.\r\n\r\nThe principle to which we especially strove to give expression, through\r\nthese laws and through executive action, was that a right is valueless\r\nunless reduced from the abstract to the concrete. This sounds like a\r\ntruism. So far from being such, the effort practically to apply it was\r\nalmost revolutionary, and gave rise to the bitterest denunciation of us\r\nby all the big lawyers, and all the big newspaper editors, who, whether\r\nsincerely or for hire, gave expression to the views of the privileged\r\nclasses. Ever since the Civil War very many of the decisions of the\r\ncourts, not as regards ordinary actions between man and man, but as\r\nregards the application of great governmental policies for social\r\nand industrial justice, had been in reality nothing but ingenious\r\njustification of the theory that these policies were mere high-sounding\r\nabstractions, and were not to be given practical effect. The tendency of\r\nthe courts had been, in the majority of cases, jealously to exert their\r\ngreat power in protecting those who least needed protection and hardly\r\nto use their power at all in the interest of those who most needed\r\nprotection. Our desire was to make the Federal Government efficient as\r\nan instrument for protecting the rights of labor within its province,\r\nand therefore to secure and enforce judicial decisions which would\r\npermit us to make this desire effective. Not only some of the Federal\r\njudges, but some of the State courts invoked the Constitution in a\r\nspirit of the narrowest legalistic obstruction to prevent the Government\r\nfrom acting in defense of labor on inter-State railways. In effect,\r\nthese judges took the view that while Congress had complete power as\r\nregards the goods transported by the railways, and could protect wealthy\r\nor well-to-do owners of these goods, yet that it had no power to protect\r\nthe lives of the men engaged in transporting the goods. Such judges\r\nfreely issued injunctions to prevent the obstruction of traffic in\r\nthe interest of the property owners, but declared unconstitutional\r\nthe action of the Government in seeking to safeguard the men, and the\r\nfamilies of the men, without whose labor the traffic could not take\r\nplace. It was an instance of the largely unconscious way in which the\r\ncourts had been twisted into the exaltation of property rights over\r\nhuman rights, and the subordination of the welfare of the laborer when\r\ncompared with the profit of the man for whom he labored. By what I fear\r\nmy conservative friends regarded as frightfully aggressive missionary\r\nwork, which included some uncommonly plain speaking as to certain unjust\r\nand anti-social judicial decisions, we succeeded in largely, but by no\r\nmeans altogether, correcting this view, at least so far as the best and\r\nmost enlightened judges were concerned.\r\n\r\nVery much the most important action I took as regards labor had nothing\r\nto do with legislation, and represented executive action which was not\r\nrequired by the Constitution. It illustrated as well as anything that\r\nI did the theory which I have called the Jackson-Lincoln theory of the\r\nPresidency; that is, that occasionally great national crises arise which\r\ncall for immediate and vigorous executive action, and that in such cases\r\nit is the duty of the President to act upon the theory that he is the\r\nsteward of the people, and that the proper attitude for him to take is\r\nthat he is bound to assume that he has the legal right to do whatever\r\nthe needs of the people demand, unless the Constitution or the laws\r\nexplicitly forbid him to do it.\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring of 1902 a universal strike began in the anthracite\r\nregions. The miners and the operators became deeply embittered, and the\r\nstrike went on throughout the summer and the early fall without any sign\r\nof reaching an end, and with almost complete stoppage of mining. In many\r\ncities, especially in the East, the heating apparatus is designed\r\nfor anthracite, so that the bituminous coal is only a very partial\r\nsubstitute. Moreover, in many regions, even in farmhouses, many of the\r\nprovisions are for burning coal and not wood. In consequence, the coal\r\nfamine became a National menace as the winter approached. In most big\r\ncities and many farming districts east of the Mississippi the shortage\r\nof anthracite threatened calamity. In the populous industrial States,\r\nfrom Ohio eastward, it was not merely calamity, but the direct disaster,\r\nthat was threatened. Ordinarily conservative men, men very sensitive as\r\nto the rights of property under normal conditions, when faced by this\r\ncrisis felt, quite rightly, that there must be some radical action. The\r\nGovernor of Massachusetts and the Mayor of New York both notified me, as\r\nthe cold weather came on, that if the coal famine continued the misery\r\nthroughout the Northeast, and especially in the great cities, would\r\nbecome appalling, and the consequent public disorder so great that\r\nfrightful consequences might follow. It is not too much to say that the\r\nsituation which confronted Pennsylvania, New York, and New England, and\r\nto a less degree the States of the Middle West, in October, 1902, was\r\nquite as serious as if they had been threatened by the invasion of a\r\nhostile army of overwhelming force.\r\n\r\nThe big coal operators had banded together, and positively refused\r\nto take any steps looking toward an accommodation. They knew that the\r\nsuffering among the miners was great; they were confident that if order\r\nwere kept, and nothing further done by the Government, they would win;\r\nand they refused to consider that the public had any rights in the\r\nmatter. They were, for the most part, men of unquestionably good private\r\nlife, and they were merely taking the extreme individualistic view of\r\nthe rights of property and the freedom of individual action upheld in\r\nthe _laissez-faire_ political economics. The mines were in the State\r\nof Pennsylvania. There was no duty whatever laid upon me by the\r\nConstitution in the matter, and I had in theory the power to act\r\ndirectly unless the Governor of Pennsylvania or the Legislature, if\r\nit were in session, should notify me that Pennsylvania could not keep\r\norder, and request me as commander-in-chief of the army of the United\r\nStates to intervene and keep order.\r\n\r\nAs long as I could avoid interfering I did so; but I directed the head\r\nof the Labor Bureau, Carroll Wright, to make a thorough investigation\r\nand lay the facts fully before me. As September passed without any sign\r\nof weakening either among the employers or the striking workmen,\r\nthe situation became so grave that I felt I would have to try to do\r\nsomething. The thing most feasible was to get both sides to agree to a\r\nCommission of Arbitration, with a promise to accept its findings; the\r\nminers to go to work as soon as the commission was appointed, at the old\r\nrate of wages. To this proposition the miners, headed by John Mitchell,\r\nagreed, stipulating only that I should have the power to name the\r\nCommission. The operators, however, positively refused. They insisted\r\nthat all that was necessary to do was for the State to keep order, using\r\nthe militia as a police force; although both they and the miners asked\r\nme to intervene under the Inter-State Commerce Law, each side requesting\r\nthat I proceed against the other, and both requests being impossible.\r\n\r\nFinally, on October 3, the representatives of both the operators and the\r\nminers met before me, in pursuance of my request. The representatives of\r\nthe miners included as their head and spokesman John Mitchell, who kept\r\nhis temper admirably and showed to much advantage. The representatives\r\nof the operators, on the contrary, came down in a most insolent frame of\r\nmind, refused to talk of arbitration or other accommodation of any kind,\r\nand used language that was insulting to the miners and offensive to me.\r\nThey were curiously ignorant of the popular temper; and when they went\r\naway from the interview they, with much pride, gave their own account of\r\nit to the papers, exulting in the fact that they had \"turned down\" both\r\nthe miners and the President.\r\n\r\nI refused to accept the rebuff, however, and continued the effort to get\r\nan agreement between the operators and the miners. I was anxious to get\r\nthis agreement, because it would prevent the necessity of taking\r\nthe extremely drastic action I meditated, and which is hereinafter\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nFortunately, this time we were successful. Yet we were on the verge of\r\nfailure, because of self-willed obstinacy on the part of the operators.\r\nThis obstinacy was utterly silly from their own standpoint, and\r\nwell-nigh criminal from the standpoint of the people at large. The\r\nminers proposed that I should name the Commission, and that if I put\r\non a representative of the employing class I should also put on a labor\r\nunion man. The operators positively declined to accept the suggestion.\r\nThey insisted upon my naming a Commission of only five men, and\r\nspecified the qualifications these men should have, carefully choosing\r\nthese qualifications so as to exclude those whom it had leaked out I was\r\nthinking of appointing, including ex-President Cleveland. They made the\r\ncondition that I was to appoint one officer of the engineer corps of\r\nthe army or navy, one man with experience of mining, one \"man of\r\nprominence,\" \"eminent as a sociologist,\" one Federal judge of the\r\nEastern district of Pennsylvania, and one mining engineer.\r\n\r\nThey positively refused to have me appoint any representative of labor,\r\nor to put on an extra man. I was desirous of putting on the extra man,\r\nbecause Mitchell and the other leaders of the miners had urged me\r\nto appoint some high Catholic ecclesiastic. Most of the miners were\r\nCatholics, and Mitchell and the leaders were very anxious to secure\r\npeaceful acquiescence by the miners in any decision rendered, and they\r\nfelt that their hands would be strengthened if such an appointment\r\nwere made. They also, quite properly, insisted that there should be\r\none representative of labor on the commission, as all of the others\r\nrepresented the propertied classes. The operators, however, absolutely\r\nrefused to acquiesce in the appointment of any representative of labor,\r\nand also announced that they would refuse to accept a sixth man on the\r\nCommission; although they spoke much less decidedly on this point. The\r\nlabor men left everything in my hands.\r\n\r\nThe final conferences with the representatives of the operators took\r\nplace in my rooms on the evening of October 15. Hour after hour went by\r\nwhile I endeavored to make the operators through their representatives\r\nsee that the country would not tolerate their insisting upon such\r\nconditions; but in vain. The two representatives of the operators were\r\nRobert Bacon and George W. Perkins. They were entirely reasonable. But\r\nthe operators themselves were entirely unreasonable. They had worked\r\nthemselves into a frame of mind where they were prepared to sacrifice\r\neverything and see civil war in the country rather than back down and\r\nacquiesce in the appointment of a representative of labor. It looked as\r\nif a deadlock were inevitable.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, after about two hours' argument, it dawned on me that\r\nthey were not objecting to the thing, but to the name. I found that they\r\ndid not mind my appointing any man, whether he was a labor man or\r\nnot, so long as he was not appointed _as_ a labor man, or _as_ a\r\nrepresentative of labor; they did not object to my exercising any\r\nlatitude I chose in the appointments so long as they were made under the\r\nheadings they had given. I shall never forget the mixture of relief\r\nand amusement I felt when I thoroughly grasped the fact that while they\r\nwould heroically submit to anarchy rather than have Tweedledum, yet if\r\nI would call it Tweedledee they would accept it with rapture; it gave\r\nme an illuminating glimpse into one corner of the mighty brains of these\r\n\"captains of industry.\" In order to carry the great and vital point and\r\nsecure agreement by both parties, all that was necessary for me to do\r\nwas to commit a technical and nominal absurdity with a solemn face. This\r\nI gladly did. I announced at once that I accepted the terms laid down.\r\nWith this understanding, I appointed the labor man I had all along\r\nhad in view, Mr. E. E. Clark, the head of the Brotherhood of Railway\r\nConductors, calling him an \"eminent sociologist\"--a term which I doubt\r\nwhether he had ever previously heard. He was a first-class man, whom\r\nI afterward put on the Inter-State Commerce Commission. I added to the\r\nArbitration Commission, on my own authority, a sixth member, in the\r\nperson of Bishop Spalding, a Catholic bishop, of Peoria, Ill., one of\r\nthe very best men to be found in the entire country. The man whom the\r\noperators had expected me to appoint as the sociologist was Carroll\r\nWright--who really was an eminent sociologist. I put him on as recorder\r\nof the Commission, and added him as a seventh member as soon as\r\nthe Commission got fairly started. In publishing the list of the\r\nCommissioners, when I came to Clark's appointment, I added: \"As a\r\nsociologist--the President assuming that for the purposes of such a\r\nCommission, the term sociologist means a man who has thought and studied\r\ndeeply on social questions and has practically applied his knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nThe relief of the whole country was so great that the sudden appearance\r\nof the head of the Brotherhood of Railway Conductors as an \"eminent\r\nsociologist\" merely furnished material for puzzled comment on the part\r\nof the press. It was a most admirable Commission. It did a noteworthy\r\nwork, and its report is a monument in the history of the relations of\r\nlabor and capital in this country. The strike, by the way, brought me\r\ninto contact with more than one man who was afterward a valued friend\r\nand fellow-worker. On the suggestion of Carroll Wright I appointed as\r\nassistant recorders to the Commission Charles P. Neill, whom I afterward\r\nmade Labor Commissioner, to succeed Wright himself, and Mr. Edward\r\nA. Moseley. Wilkes-Barre was the center of the strike; and the man in\r\nWilkes-Barre who helped me most was Father Curran; I grew to know\r\nand trust and believe in him, and throughout my term in office, and\r\nafterward, he was not only my stanch friend, but one of the men by whose\r\nadvice and counsel I profited most in matters affecting the welfare of\r\nthe miners and their families.\r\n\r\nI was greatly relieved at the result, for more than one reason. Of\r\ncourse, first and foremost, my concern was to avert a frightful calamity\r\nto the United States. In the next place I was anxious to save the great\r\ncoal operators and all of the class of big propertied men, of which they\r\nwere members, from the dreadful punishment which their own folly would\r\nhave brought on them if I had not acted; and one of the exasperating\r\nthings was that they were so blinded that they could not see that I was\r\ntrying to save them from themselves and to avert, not only for their\r\nsakes, but for the sake of the country, the excesses which would have\r\nbeen indulged in at their expense if they had longer persisted in their\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nThe great Anthracite Strike of 1902 left an indelible impress upon\r\nthe people of the United States. It showed clearly to all wise and\r\nfar-seeing men that the labor problem in this country had entered upon\r\na new phase. Industry had grown. Great financial corporations, doing a\r\nnation-wide and even a world-wide business, had taken the place of\r\nthe smaller concerns of an earlier time. The old familiar, intimate\r\nrelations between employer and employee were passing. A few generations\r\nbefore, the boss had known every man in his shop; he called his men\r\nBill, Tom, Dick, John; he inquired after their wives and babies; he\r\nswapped jokes and stories and perhaps a bit of tobacco with them. In the\r\nsmall establishment there had been a friendly human relationship between\r\nemployer and employee.\r\n\r\nThere was no such relation between the great railway magnates, who\r\ncontrolled the anthracite industry, and the one hundred and fifty\r\nthousand men who worked in their mines, or the half million women and\r\nchildren who were dependent upon these miners for their daily bread.\r\nVery few of these mine workers had ever seen, for instance, the\r\npresident of the Reading Railroad. Had they seen him many of them could\r\nnot have spoken to him, for tens of thousands of the mine workers were\r\nrecent immigrants who did not understand the language which he spoke and\r\nwho spoke a language which he could not understand.\r\n\r\nAgain, a few generations ago an American workman could have saved money,\r\ngone West and taken up a homestead. Now the free lands were gone. In\r\nearlier days a man who began with pick and shovel might have come to own\r\na mine. That outlet too was now closed, as regards the immense majority,\r\nand few, if any, of the one hundred and fifty thousand mine workers\r\ncould ever aspire to enter the small circle of men who held in their\r\ngrasp the great anthracite industry. The majority of the men who earned\r\nwages in the coal industry, if they wished to progress at all, were\r\ncompelled to progress not by ceasing to be wage-earners, but by\r\nimproving the conditions under which all the wage-earners in all the\r\nindustries of the country lived and worked, as well of course, as\r\nimproving their own individual efficiency.\r\n\r\nAnother change which had come about as a result of the foregoing was a\r\ncrass inequality in the bargaining relation between the employer and\r\nthe individual employee standing alone. The great coal-mining and\r\ncoal-carrying companies, which employed their tens of thousands, could\r\neasily dispense with the services of any particular miner. The miner, on\r\nthe other hand, however expert, could not dispense with the companies.\r\nHe needed a job; his wife and children would starve if he did not get\r\none. What the miner had to sell--his labor--was a perishable commodity;\r\nthe labor of to-day--if not sold to-day--was lost forever. Moreover,\r\nhis labor was not like most commodities--a mere thing; it was part of\r\na living, breathing human being. The workman saw, and all citizens who\r\ngave earnest thought to the matter saw, that the labor problem was not\r\nonly an economic, but also a moral, a human problem. Individually the\r\nminers were impotent when they sought to enter a wage-contract with the\r\ngreat companies; they could make fair terms only by uniting into trade\r\nunions to bargain collectively. The men were forced to cooperate to\r\nsecure not only their economic, but their simple human rights. They,\r\nlike other workmen, were compelled by the very conditions under which\r\nthey lived to unite in unions of their industry or trade, and these\r\nunions were bound to grow in size, in strength, and in power for good\r\nand evil as the industries in which the men were employed grew larger\r\nand larger.\r\n\r\nA democracy can be such in fact only if there is some rough\r\napproximation in similarity in stature among the men composing it. One\r\nof us can deal in our private lives with the grocer or the butcher\r\nor the carpenter or the chicken raiser, or if we are the grocer or\r\ncarpenter or butcher or farmer, we can deal with our customers, because\r\n_we are all of about the same size_. Therefore a simple and poor society\r\ncan exist as a democracy on a basis of sheer individualism. But a rich\r\nand complex industrial society cannot so exist; for some individuals,\r\nand especially those artificial individuals called corporations, become\r\nso very big that the ordinary individual is utterly dwarfed beside them,\r\nand cannot deal with them on terms of equality. It therefore becomes\r\nnecessary for these ordinary individuals to combine in their turn, first\r\nin order to act in their collective capacity through that biggest of all\r\ncombinations called the Government, and second, to act, also in their\r\nown self-defense, through private combinations, such as farmers'\r\nassociations and trade unions.\r\n\r\nThis the great coal operators did not see. They did not see that their\r\nproperty rights, which they so stoutly defended, were of the same\r\ntexture as were the human rights, which they so blindly and hotly\r\ndenied. They did not see that the power which they exercised by\r\nrepresenting their stockholders was of the same texture as the power\r\nwhich the union leaders demanded of representing the workmen, who had\r\ndemocratically elected them. They did not see that the right to use\r\none's property as one will can be maintained only so long as it is\r\nconsistent with the maintenance of certain fundamental human rights, of\r\nthe rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, or, as we\r\nmay restate them in these later days, of the rights of the worker to a\r\nliving wage, to reasonable hours of labor, to decent working and\r\nliving conditions, to freedom of thought and speech and industrial\r\nrepresentation,--in short, to a measure of industrial democracy and, in\r\nreturn for his arduous toil, to a worthy and decent life according to\r\nAmerican standards. Still another thing these great business leaders did\r\nnot see. They did not see that both their interests and the interests of\r\nthe workers must be accommodated, and if need be, subordinated, to the\r\nfundamental permanent interests of the whole community. No man and no\r\ngroup of men may so exercise their rights as to deprive the nation of\r\nthe things which are necessary and vital to the common life. A strike\r\nwhich ties up the coal supplies of a whole section is a strike invested\r\nwith a public interest.\r\n\r\nSo great was that public interest in the Coal Strike of 1902, so deeply\r\nand strongly did I feel the wave of indignation which swept over the\r\nwhole country that had I not succeeded in my efforts to induce the\r\noperators to listen to reason, I should reluctantly but none the less\r\ndecisively have taken a step which would have brought down upon my head\r\nthe execrations of many of \"the captains of industry,\" as well as of\r\nsundry \"respectable\" newspapers who dutifully take their cue from them.\r\nAs a man should be judged by his intentions as well as by his actions, I\r\nwill give here the story of the intervention that never happened.\r\n\r\nWhile the coal operators were exulting over the fact that they had\r\n\"turned down\" the miners and the President, there arose in all parts\r\nof the country an outburst of wrath so universal that even so naturally\r\nconservative a man as Grover Cleveland wrote to me, expressing his\r\nsympathy with the course I was following, his indignation at the conduct\r\nof the operators, and his hope that I would devise some method of\r\neffective action. In my own mind I was already planning effective\r\naction; but it was of a very drastic character, and I did not wish\r\nto take it until the failure of all other expedients had rendered it\r\nnecessary. Above all, I did not wish to talk about it until and unless I\r\nactually acted. I had definitely determined that somehow or other act\r\nI would, that somehow or other the coal famine should be broken. To\r\naccomplish this end it was necessary that the mines should be run, and,\r\nif I could get no voluntary agreement between the contending sides, that\r\nan Arbitration Commission should be appointed which would command such\r\npublic confidence as to enable me, without too much difficulty, to\r\nenforce its terms upon both parties. Ex-President Cleveland's letter not\r\nmerely gratified me, but gave me the chance to secure him as head of the\r\nArbitration Commission. I at once wrote him, stating that I would very\r\nprobably have to appoint an Arbitration Commission or Investigating\r\nCommission to look into the matter and decide on the rights of the\r\ncase, whether or not the operators asked for or agreed to abide by the\r\ndecisions of such a Commission; and that I would ask him to accept the\r\nchief place on the Commission. He answered that he would do so. I picked\r\nout several first-class men for other positions on the Commission.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Governor of Pennsylvania had all the Pennsylvania\r\nmilitia in the anthracite region, although without any effect upon the\r\nresumption of mining. The method of action upon which I had determined\r\nin the last resort was to get the Governor of Pennsylvania to ask me\r\nto keep order. Then I would put in the army under the command of some\r\nfirst-rate general. I would instruct this general to keep absolute\r\norder, taking any steps whatever that was necessary to prevent\r\ninterference by the strikers or their sympathizers with men who wanted\r\nto work. I would also instruct him to dispossess the operators and run\r\nthe mines as a receiver until such time as the Commission might make its\r\nreport, and until I, as President, might issue further orders in view of\r\nthis report. I had to find a man who possessed the necessary good sense,\r\njudgment, and nerve to act in such event. He was ready to hand in the\r\nperson of Major-General Schofield. I sent for him, telling him that if\r\nI had to make use of him it would be because the crisis was only less\r\nserious than that of the Civil War, that the action taken would be\r\npractically a war measure, and that if I sent him he must act in a\r\npurely military capacity under me as commander-in-chief, paying no heed\r\nto any authority, judicial or otherwise, except mine. He was a fine\r\nfellow--a most respectable-looking old boy, with side whiskers and a\r\nblack skull-cap, without any of the outward aspect of the conventional\r\nmilitary dictator; but in both nerve and judgment he was all right, and\r\nhe answered quietly that if I gave the order he would take possession\r\nof the mines, and would guarantee to open them and to run them without\r\npermitting any interference either by the owners or the strikers or\r\nanybody else, so long as I told him to stay. I then saw Senator Quay,\r\nwho, like every other responsible man in high position, was greatly\r\nwrought up over the condition of things. I told him that he need be\r\nunder no alarm as to the problem not being solved, that I was going to\r\nmake another effort to get the operators and miners to come together,\r\nbut that I would solve the problem in any event and get coal; that,\r\nhowever, I did not wish to tell him anything of the details of my\r\nintention, but merely to have him arrange that whenever I gave the word\r\nthe Governor of Pennsylvania should request me to intervene; that when\r\nthis was done I would be responsible for all that followed, and would\r\nguarantee that the coal famine would end forthwith. The Senator made\r\nno inquiry or comment, and merely told me that he in his turn would\r\nguarantee that the Governor would request my intervention the minute I\r\nasked that the request be made.\r\n\r\nThese negotiations were concluded with the utmost secrecy, General\r\nSchofield being the only man who knew exactly what my plan was, and\r\nSenator Quay, two members of my Cabinet, and ex-President Cleveland and\r\nthe other men whom I proposed to put on the Commission, the only other\r\nmen who knew that I had a plan. As I have above outlined, my efforts to\r\nbring about an agreement between the operators and miners were finally\r\nsuccessful. I was glad not to have to take possession of the mines on my\r\nown initiative by means of General Schofield and the regulars. I was all\r\nready to act, and would have done so without the slightest hesitation or\r\na moment's delay if the negotiations had fallen through. And my action\r\nwould have been entirely effective. But it is never well to take drastic\r\naction if the result can be achieved with equal efficiency in less\r\ndrastic fashion; and, although this was a minor consideration, I was\r\npersonally saved a good deal of future trouble by being able to avoid\r\nthis drastic action. At the time I should have been almost unanimously\r\nsupported. With the famine upon them the people would not have tolerated\r\nany conduct that would have thwarted what I was doing. Probably no man\r\nin Congress, and no man in the Pennsylvania State Legislature, would\r\nhave raised his voice against me. Although there would have been\r\nplenty of muttering, nothing would have been done to interfere with the\r\nsolution of the problem which I had devised, _until the solution was\r\naccomplished and the problem ceased to be a problem_. Once this was\r\ndone, and when people were no longer afraid of a coal famine, and began\r\nto forget that they ever had been afraid of it, and to be indifferent as\r\nregards the consequences to those who put an end to it, then my enemies\r\nwould have plucked up heart and begun a campaign against me. I doubt if\r\nthey could have accomplished much anyway, for the only effective remedy\r\nagainst me would have been impeachment, and that they would not have\r\nventured to try.[*]\r\n\r\n     [*] One of my appointees on the Anthracite Strike Commission\r\n     was Judge George Gray, of Delaware, a Democrat whose\r\n     standing in the country was second only to that of Grover\r\n     Cleveland. A year later he commented on my action as\r\n     follows:\r\n\r\n\"I have no hesitation in saying that the President of the United States\r\nwas confronted in October, 1902, by the existence of a crisis more grave\r\nand threatening than any that had occurred since the Civil War. I mean\r\nthat the cessation of mining in the anthracite country, brought about\r\nby the dispute between the miners and those who controlled the greatest\r\nnatural monopoly in this country and perhaps in the world, had\r\nbrought upon more than one-half of the American people a condition\r\nof deprivation of one of the necessaries of life, and the probable\r\ncontinuance of the dispute threatened not only the comfort and health,\r\nbut the safety and good order, of the nation. He was without legal or\r\nconstitutional power to interfere, but his position as President of the\r\nUnited States gave him an influence, a leadership, as first citizen\r\nof the republic, that enabled him to appeal to the patriotism and good\r\nsense of the parties to the controversy and to place upon them the moral\r\ncoercion of public opinion to agree to an arbitrament of the strike then\r\nexisting and threatening consequences so direful to the whole country.\r\nHe acted promptly and courageously, and in so doing averted the dangers\r\nto which I have alluded.\r\n\r\n\"So far from interfering or infringing upon property rights, the\r\nPresidents' action tended to conserve them. The peculiar situation, as\r\nregards the anthracite coal interest, was that they controlled a natural\r\nmonopoly of a product necessary to the comfort and to the very life of a\r\nlarge portion of the people. A prolonged deprivation of the enjoyment of\r\nthis necessary of life would have tended to precipitate an attack upon\r\nthese property rights of which you speak; for, after all, it is vain\r\nto deny that this property, so peculiar in its conditions, and which\r\nis properly spoken of as a natural monopoly, is affected with a public\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\"I do not think that any President ever acted more wisely, courageously\r\nor promptly in a national crisis. Mr. Roosevelt deserves unstinted\r\npraise for what he did.\"\r\n\r\nThey would doubtless have acted precisely as they acted as regards the\r\nacquisition of the Panama Canal Zone in 1903, and the stoppage of\r\nthe panic of 1907 by my action in the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company\r\nmatter. Nothing could have made the American people surrender the canal\r\nzone. But after it was an accomplished fact, and the canal was\r\nunder way, then they settled down to comfortable acceptance of the\r\naccomplished fact, and as their own interests were no longer in\r\njeopardy, they paid no heed to the men who attacked me because of what I\r\nhad done--and also continue to attack me, although they are exceedingly\r\ncareful not to propose to right the \"wrong,\" in the only proper way if\r\nit really was a wrong, by replacing the old Republic of Panama under the\r\ntyranny of Colombia and giving Colombia sole or joint ownership of\r\nthe canal itself. In the case of the panic of 1907 (as in the case\r\nof Panama), what I did was not only done openly, but depended for its\r\neffect upon being done and with the widest advertisement. Nobody in\r\nCongress ventured to make an objection at the time. No serious leader\r\noutside made any objection. The one concern of everybody was to stop\r\nthe panic, and everybody was overjoyed that I was willing to take the\r\nresponsibility of stopping it upon my own shoulders. But a few months\r\nafterward, the panic was a thing of the past. People forgot the\r\nfrightful condition of alarm in which they had been. They no longer had\r\na personal interest in preventing any interference with the stoppage of\r\nthe panic. Then the men who had not dared to raise their voices until\r\nall danger was past came bravely forth from their hiding places and\r\ndenounced the action which had saved them. They had kept a hushed\r\nsilence when there was danger; they made clamorous outcry when there was\r\nsafety in doing so.\r\n\r\nJust the same course would have been followed in connection with the\r\nAnthracite Coal Strike if I had been obliged to act in the fashion I\r\nintended to act had I failed to secure a voluntary agreement between the\r\nminers and the operators. Even as it was, my action was remembered with\r\nrancor by the heads of the great moneyed interests; and as time went by\r\nwas assailed with constantly increasing vigor by the newspapers these\r\nmen controlled. Had I been forced to take possession of the mines,\r\nthese men and the politicians hostile to me would have waited until the\r\npopular alarm was over and the popular needs met, just as they waited\r\nin the case of the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company; and then they\r\nwould have attacked me precisely as they did attack me as regards the\r\nTennessee Coal and Iron Company.\r\n\r\nOf course, in labor controversies it was not always possible to champion\r\nthe cause of the workers, because in many cases strikes were called\r\nwhich were utterly unwarranted and were fought by methods which cannot\r\nbe too harshly condemned. No straightforward man can believe, and no\r\nfearless man will assert, that a trade union is always right. That\r\nman is an unworthy public servant who by speech or silence, by direct\r\nstatement or cowardly evasion, invariably throws the weight of his\r\ninfluence on the side of the trade union, whether it is right or wrong.\r\nIt has occasionally been my duty to give utterance to the feelings of\r\nall right thinking men by expressing the most emphatic disapproval of\r\nunwise or even immoral notions by representatives of labor. The man is\r\nno true democrat, and if an American, is unworthy of the traditions\r\nof his country who, in problems calling for the exercise of a moral\r\njudgment, fails to take his stand on conduct and not on class. There are\r\ngood and bad wage-workers just as there are good and bad employers, and\r\ngood and bad men of small means and of large means alike.\r\n\r\nBut a willingness to do equal and exact justice to all citizens,\r\nirrespective of race, creed, section or economic interest and position,\r\ndoes not imply a failure to recognize the enormous economic, political\r\nand moral possibilities of the trade union. Just as democratic\r\ngovernment cannot be condemned because of errors and even crimes\r\ncommitted by men democratically elected, so trade-unionism must not be\r\ncondemned because of errors or crimes of occasional trade-union leaders.\r\nThe problem lies deeper. While we must repress all illegalities and\r\ndiscourage all immoralities, whether of labor organizations or of\r\ncorporations, we must recognize the fact that to-day the organization of\r\nlabor into trade unions and federations is necessary, is beneficent,\r\nand is one of the greatest possible agencies in the attainment of a true\r\nindustrial, as well as a true political, democracy in the United States.\r\n\r\nThis is a fact which many well-intentioned people even to-day do not\r\nunderstand. They do not understand that the labor problem is a human\r\nand a moral as well as an economic problem; that a fall in wages, an\r\nincrease in hours, a deterioration of labor conditions mean wholesale\r\nmoral as well as economic degeneration, and the needless sacrifice of\r\nhuman lives and human happiness, while a rise of wages, a lessening of\r\nhours, a bettering of conditions, mean an intellectual, moral and social\r\nuplift of millions of American men and women. There are employers to-day\r\nwho, like the great coal operators, speak as though they were lords of\r\nthese countless armies of Americans, who toil in factory, in shop, in\r\nmill and in the dark places under the earth. They fail to see that all\r\nthese men have the right and the duty to combine to protect themselves\r\nand their families from want and degradation. They fail to see that\r\nthe Nation and the Government, within the range of fair play and a just\r\nadministration of the law, must inevitably sympathize with the men who\r\nhave nothing but their wages, with the men who are struggling for\r\na decent life, as opposed to men, however honorable, who are merely\r\nfighting for larger profits and an autocratic control of big business.\r\nEach man should have all he earns, whether by brain or body; and\r\nthe director, the great industrial leader, is one of the greatest of\r\nearners, and should have a proportional reward; but no man should live\r\non the earnings of another, and there should not be too gross inequality\r\nbetween service and reward.\r\n\r\nThere are many men to-day, men of integrity and intelligence, who\r\nhonestly believe that we must go back to the labor conditions of half\r\na century ago. They are opposed to trade unions, root and branch. They\r\nnote the unworthy conduct of many labor leaders, they find instances\r\nof bad work by union men, of a voluntary restriction of output, of\r\nvexations and violent strikes, of jurisdictional disputes between unions\r\nwhich often disastrously involve the best intentioned and fairest of\r\nemployers. All these things occur and should be repressed. But the same\r\ncritic of the trade union might find equal causes of complaint against\r\nindividual employers of labor, or even against great associations of\r\nmanufacturers. He might find many instances of an unwarranted cutting of\r\nwages, of flagrant violations of factory laws and tenement house laws,\r\nof the deliberate and systematic cheating of employees by means of truck\r\nstores, of the speeding up of work to a point which is fatal to the\r\nhealth of the workman, of the sweating of foreign-born workers, of\r\nthe drafting of feeble little children into dusty workshops, of\r\nblack-listing, of putting spies into union meetings and of the\r\nemployment in strike times of vicious and desperate ruffians, who\r\nare neither better nor worse than are the thugs who are occasionally\r\nemployed by unions under the sinister name, \"entertainment committees.\"\r\nI believe that the overwhelming majority, both of workmen and of\r\nemployers, are law-abiding peaceful, and honorable citizens, and I do\r\nnot think that it is just to lay up the errors and wrongs of individuals\r\nto the entire group to which they belong. I also think--and this is\r\na belief which has been borne upon me through many years of practical\r\nexperience--that the trade union is growing constantly in wisdom as well\r\nas in power, and is becoming one of the most efficient agencies toward\r\nthe solution of our industrial problems, the elimination of poverty and\r\nof industrial disease and accidents, the lessening of unemployment,\r\nthe achievement of industrial democracy and the attainment of a larger\r\nmeasure of social and industrial justice.\r\n\r\nIf I were a factory employee, a workman on the railroads or a\r\nwage-earner of any sort, I would undoubtedly join the union of my trade.\r\nIf I disapproved of its policy, I would join in order to fight that\r\npolicy; if the union leaders were dishonest, I would join in order to\r\nput them out. I believe in the union and I believe that all men who are\r\nbenefited by the union are morally bound to help to the extent of their\r\npower in the common interests advanced by the union. Nevertheless,\r\nirrespective of whether a man should or should not, and does or does\r\nnot, join the union of his trade, all the rights, privileges and\r\nimmunities of that man as an American and as a citizen should be\r\nsafeguarded and upheld by the law. We dare not make an outlaw of any\r\nindividual or any group, whatever his or its opinions or professions.\r\nThe non-unionist, like the unionist, must be protected in all his legal\r\nrights by the full weight and power of the law.\r\n\r\nThis question came up before me in the shape of the right of a non-union\r\nprinter named Miller to hold his position in the Government Printing\r\nOffice. As I said before, I believe in trade unions. I always prefer to\r\nsee a union shop. But any private preferences cannot control my public\r\nactions. The Government can recognize neither union men nor non-union\r\nmen as such, and is bound to treat both exactly alike. In the Government\r\nPrinting Office not many months prior to the opening of the Presidential\r\ncampaign of 1904, when I was up for reelection, I discovered that a man\r\nhad been dismissed because he did not belong to the union. I reinstated\r\nhim. Mr. Gompers, the President of the American Federation of Labor,\r\nwith various members of the executive council of that body, called upon\r\nme to protest on September 29, 1903, and I answered them as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I thank you and your committee for your courtesy, and I appreciate the\r\nopportunity to meet with you. It will always be a pleasure to see you\r\nor any representative of your organizations or of your Federation as a\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n\"As regards the Miller case, I have little to add to what I have already\r\nsaid. In dealing with it I ask you to remember that I am dealing purely\r\nwith the relation of the Government to its employees. I must govern\r\nmy action by the laws of the land, which I am sworn to administer,\r\nand which differentiate any case in which the Government of the United\r\nStates is a party from all other cases whatsoever. These laws are\r\nenacted for the benefit of the whole people, and cannot and must not be\r\nconstrued as permitting the crimination against some of the people. I\r\nam President of all the people of the United States, without regard to\r\ncreed, color, birthplace, occupation or social condition. My aim is\r\nto do equal and exact justice as among them all. In the employment and\r\ndismissal of men in the Government service I can no more recognize\r\nthe fact that a man does or does not belong to a union as being for or\r\nagainst him than I can recognize the fact that he is a Protestant or a\r\nCatholic, a Jew or a Gentile, as being for or against him.\r\n\r\n\"In the communications sent me by various labor organizations protesting\r\nagainst the retention of Miller in the Government Printing Office, the\r\ngrounds alleged are twofold: 1, that he is a non-union man; 2, that he\r\nis not personally fit. The question of his personal fitness is one to be\r\nsettled in the routine of administrative detail, and cannot be allowed\r\nto conflict with or to complicate the larger question of governmental\r\ndiscrimination for or against him or any other man because he is or is\r\nnot a member of a union. This is the only question now before me for\r\ndecision; and as to this my decision is final.\"\r\n\r\nBecause of things I have done on behalf of justice to the workingman, I\r\nhave often been called a Socialist. Usually I have not taken the trouble\r\neven to notice the epithet. I am not afraid of names, and I am not\r\none of those who fear to do what is right because some one else will\r\nconfound me with partisans with whose principles I am not in accord.\r\nMoreover, I know that many American Socialists are high-minded and\r\nhonorable citizens, who in reality are merely radical social reformers.\r\nThey are oppressed by the brutalities and industrial injustices which we\r\nsee everywhere about us. When I recall how often I have seen Socialists\r\nand ardent non-Socialists working side by side for some specific measure\r\nof social or industrial reform, and how I have found opposed to them on\r\nthe side of privilege many shrill reactionaries who insist on calling\r\nall reformers Socialists, I refuse to be panic-stricken by having this\r\ntitle mistakenly applied to me.\r\n\r\nNone the less, without impugning their motives, I do disagree most\r\nemphatically with both the fundamental philosophy and the proposed\r\nremedies of the Marxian Socialists. These Socialists are unalterably\r\nopposed to our whole industrial system. They believe that the payment of\r\nwages means everywhere and inevitably an exploitation of the laborer\r\nby the employer, and that this leads inevitably to a class war between\r\nthose two groups, or, as they would say, between the capitalists and the\r\nproletariat. They assert that this class war is already upon us and\r\ncan only be ended when capitalism is entirely destroyed and all the\r\nmachines, mills, mines, railroads and other private property used in\r\nproduction are confiscated, expropriated or taken over by the workers.\r\nThey do not as a rule claim--although some of the sinister extremists\r\namong them do--that there is and must be a continual struggle between\r\ntwo great classes, whose interests are opposed and cannot be reconciled.\r\nIn this war they insist that the whole government--National, State and\r\nlocal--is on the side of the employers and is used by them against\r\nthe workmen, and that our law and even our common morality are class\r\nweapons, like a policeman's club or a Gatling gun.\r\n\r\nI have never believed, and do not to-day believe, that such a class war\r\nis upon us, or need ever be upon us; nor do I believe that the interests\r\nof wage-earners and employers cannot be harmonized, compromised and\r\nadjusted. It would be idle to deny that wage-earners have certain\r\ndifferent economic interests from, let us say, manufacturers or\r\nimporters, just as farmers have different interests from sailors, and\r\nfishermen from bankers. There is no reason why any of these economic\r\ngroups should not consult their group interests by any legitimate means\r\nand with due regard to the common, overlying interests of all. I do\r\nnot even deny that the majority of wage-earners, because they have less\r\nproperty and less industrial security than others and because they do\r\nnot own the machinery with which they work (as does the farmer) are\r\nperhaps in greater need of acting together than are other groups in the\r\ncommunity. But I do insist (and I believe that the great majority of\r\nwage-earners take the same view) that employers and employees have\r\noverwhelming interests in common, both as partners in industry and as\r\ncitizens of the republic, and that where these interests are apart they\r\ncan be adjusted by so altering our laws and their interpretation as to\r\nsecure to all members of the community social and industrial justice.\r\n\r\nI have always maintained that our worst revolutionaries to-day are those\r\nreactionaries who do not see and will not admit that there is any need\r\nfor change. Such men seem to believe that the four and a half million\r\nProgressive voters, who in 1912 registered their solemn protest against\r\nour social and industrial injustices, are \"anarchists,\" who are not\r\nwilling to let ill enough alone. If these reactionaries had lived at an\r\nearlier time in our history, they would have advocated Sedition Laws,\r\nopposed free speech and free assembly, and voted against free schools,\r\nfree access by settlers to the public lands, mechanics' lien laws, the\r\nprohibition of truck stores and the abolition of imprisonment for debt;\r\nand they are the men who to-day oppose minimum wage laws, insurance\r\nof workmen against the ills of industrial life and the reform of\r\nour legislators and our courts, which can alone render such measures\r\npossible. Some of these reactionaries are not bad men, but merely\r\nshortsighted and belated. It is these reactionaries, however, who, by\r\n\"standing pat\" on industrial injustice, incite inevitably to industrial\r\nrevolt, and it is only we who advocate political and industrial\r\ndemocracy who render possible the progress of our American industry\r\non large constructive lines with a minimum of friction because with a\r\nmaximum of justice.\r\n\r\nEverything possible should be done to secure the wage-workers fair\r\ntreatment. There should be an increased wage for the worker of\r\nincreased productiveness. Everything possible should be done against the\r\ncapitalist who strives, not to reward special efficiency, but to use\r\nit as an excuse for reducing the reward of moderate efficiency. The\r\ncapitalist is an unworthy citizen who pays the efficient man no more\r\nthan he has been content to pay the average man, and nevertheless\r\nreduces the wage of the average man; and effort should be made by the\r\nGovernment to check and punish him. When labor-saving machinery\r\nis introduced, special care should be taken--by the Government if\r\nnecessary--to see that the wage-worker gets his share of the benefit,\r\nand that it is not all absorbed by the employer or capitalist. The\r\nfollowing case, which has come to my knowledge, illustrates what I mean.\r\nA number of new machines were installed in a certain shoe factory, and\r\nas a result there was a heavy increase in production even though there\r\nwas no increase in the labor force. Some of the workmen were instructed\r\nin the use of these machines by special demonstrators sent out by the\r\nmakers of the machines. These men, by reason of their special aptitudes\r\nand the fact that they were not called upon to operate the machines\r\ncontinuously nine hours every day, week in and week out, but only for an\r\nhour or so at special times, were naturally able to run the machines at\r\ntheir maximum capacity. When these demonstrators had left the factory,\r\nand the company's own employees had become used to operating the\r\nmachines at a fair rate of speed, the foreman of the establishment\r\ngradually speeded the machines and demanded a larger and still larger\r\noutput, constantly endeavoring to drive the men on to greater exertions.\r\nEven with a slightly less maximum capacity, the introduction of this\r\nmachinery resulted in a great increase over former production with the\r\nsame amount of labor; and so great were the profits from the business in\r\nthe following two years as to equal the total capitalized stock of the\r\ncompany. But not a cent got into the pay envelope of the workmen beyond\r\nwhat they had formerly been receiving before the introduction of this\r\nnew machinery, notwithstanding that it had meant an added strain,\r\nphysical and mental, upon their energies, and that they were forced\r\nto work harder than ever before. The whole of the increased profits\r\nremained with the company. Now this represented an \"increase of\r\nefficiency,\" with a positive decrease of social and industrial justice.\r\nThe increase of prosperity which came from increase of production in no\r\nway benefited the wage-workers. I hold that they were treated with gross\r\ninjustice; and that society, acting if necessary through the Government,\r\nin such a case should bend its energies to remedy such injustice; and\r\nI will support any proper legislation that will aid in securing the\r\ndesired end.\r\n\r\nThe wage-worker should not only receive fair treatment; he should give\r\nfair treatment. In order that prosperity may be passed around it is\r\nnecessary that the prosperity exist. In order that labor shall receive\r\nits fair share in the division of reward it is necessary that there be\r\na reward to divide. Any proposal to reduce efficiency by insisting that\r\nthe most efficient shall be limited in their output to what the least\r\nefficient can do, is a proposal to limit by so much production, and\r\ntherefore to impoverish by so much the public, and specifically to\r\nreduce the amount that can be divided among the producers. This is all\r\nwrong. Our protest must be against unfair division of the reward for\r\nproduction. Every encouragement should be given the business man, the\r\nemployer, to make his business prosperous, and therefore to earn more\r\nmoney for himself; and in like fashion every encouragement should be\r\ngiven the efficient workman. We must always keep in mind that to reduce\r\nthe amount of production serves merely to reduce the amount that is\r\nto be divided, is in no way permanently efficient as a protest against\r\nunequal distribution and is permanently detrimental to the entire\r\ncommunity. But increased productiveness is not secured by excessive\r\nlabor amid unhealthy surroundings. The contrary is true. Shorter hours,\r\nand healthful conditions, and opportunity for the wage-worker to make\r\nmore money, and the chance for enjoyment as well as work, all add to\r\nefficiency. My contention is that there should be no penalization of\r\nefficient productiveness, brought about under healthy conditions;\r\nbut that every increase of production brought about by an increase in\r\nefficiency should benefit all the parties to it, including wage-workers\r\nas well as employers or capitalists, men who work with their hands as\r\nwell as men who work with their heads.\r\n\r\nWith the Western Federation of Miners I more than once had serious\r\ntrouble. The leaders of this organization had preached anarchy, and\r\ncertain of them were indicted for having practiced murder in the case of\r\nGovernor Steunenberg, of Idaho. On one occasion in a letter or speech I\r\ncoupled condemnation of these labor leaders and condemnation of certain\r\nbig capitalists, describing them all alike as \"undesirable citizens.\"\r\nThis gave great offense to both sides. The open attack upon me was made\r\nfor the most part either by the New York newspapers which were frankly\r\nrepresentatives of Wall Street, or else by those so-called--and\r\nmiscalled--Socialists who had anarchistic leanings. Many of the latter\r\nsent me open letters of denunciation, and to one of them I responded as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON, April 22, 1907.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI have received your letter of the 19th instant, in which you enclose\r\nthe draft of the formal letter which is to follow. I have been notified\r\nthat several delegations, bearing similar requests, are on the way\r\nhither. In the letter you, on behalf of the Cook County, Moyer-Haywood\r\nconference, protest against certain language I used in a recent letter\r\nwhich you assert to be designed to influence the course of justice\r\nin the case of the trial for murder of Messrs. Moyer and Haywood. I\r\nentirely agree with you that it is improper to endeavor to influence the\r\ncourse of justice, whether by threats or in any similar manner. For this\r\nreason I have regretted most deeply the actions of such organizations as\r\nyour own in undertaking to accomplish this very result in the very case\r\nof which you speak. For instance, your letter is headed \"Cook\r\nCounty Moyer-Haywood-Pettibone Conference,\" with the headlines:\r\n\"_Death_--cannot--will not--and shall not claim our brothers!\" This\r\nshows that you and your associates are not demanding a fair trial, or\r\nworking for a fair trial, but are announcing in advance that the verdict\r\nshall only be one way and that you will not tolerate any other verdict.\r\nSuch action is flagrant in its impropriety, and I join heartily in\r\ncondemning it.\r\n\r\nBut it is a simple absurdity to suppose that because any man is on trial\r\nfor a given offense he is therefore to be freed from all criticism upon\r\nhis general conduct and manner of life. In my letter to which you object\r\nI referred to a certain prominent financier, Mr. Harriman, on the one\r\nhand, and to Messrs. Moyer, Haywood and Debs on the other, as being\r\nequally undesirable citizens. It is as foolish to assert that this was\r\ndesigned to influence the trial of Moyer and Haywood as to assert that\r\nit was designed to influence the suits that have been brought against\r\nMr. Harriman. I neither expressed nor indicated any opinion as to\r\nwhether Messrs. Moyer and Haywood were guilty of the murder of Governor\r\nSteunenberg. If they are guilty, they certainly ought to be punished.\r\nIf they are not guilty, they certainly ought not to be punished. But no\r\npossible outcome either of the trial or the suits can affect my judgment\r\nas to the undesirability of the type of citizenship of those whom I\r\nmentioned. Messrs. Moyer, Haywood, and Debs stand as representatives of\r\nthose men who have done as much to discredit the labor movement as the\r\nworst speculative financiers or most unscrupulous employers of labor and\r\ndebauchers of legislatures have done to discredit honest capitalists and\r\nfair-dealing business men. They stand as the representatives of those\r\nmen who by their public utterances and manifestoes, by the utterances of\r\nthe papers they control or inspire, and by the words and deeds of those\r\nassociated with or subordinated to them, habitually appear as guilty of\r\nincitement to or apology for bloodshed and violence. If this does\r\nnot constitute undesirable citizenship, then there can never be any\r\nundesirable citizens. The men whom I denounce represent the men who\r\nhave abandoned that legitimate movement for the uplifting of labor, with\r\nwhich I have the most hearty sympathy; they have adopted practices which\r\ncut them off from those who lead this legitimate movement. In every way\r\nI shall support the law-abiding and upright representatives of labor,\r\nand in no way can I better support them than by drawing the sharpest\r\npossible line between them on the one hand, and, on the other hand,\r\nthose preachers of violence who are themselves the worst foes of the\r\nhonest laboring man.\r\n\r\nLet me repeat my deep regret that any body of men should so far forget\r\ntheir duty to the country as to endeavor by the formation of societies\r\nand in other ways to influence the course of justice in this matter.\r\nI have received many such letters as yours. Accompanying them\r\nwere newspaper clippings announcing demonstrations, parades, and\r\nmass-meetings designed to show that the representatives of labor,\r\nwithout regard to the facts, demand the acquittal of Messrs. Haywood and\r\nMoyer. Such meetings can, of course, be designed only to coerce court\r\nor jury in rendering a verdict, and they therefore deserve all the\r\ncondemnation which you in your letters say should be awarded to those\r\nwho endeavor improperly to influence the course of justice.\r\n\r\nYou would, of course, be entirely within your rights if you merely\r\nannounced that you thought Messrs. Moyer and Haywood were \"desirable\r\ncitizens\"--though in such case I should take frank issue with you and\r\nshould say that, wholly without regard to whether or not they are guilty\r\nof the crime for which they are now being tried, they represent as\r\nthoroughly undesirable a type of citizenship as can be found in this\r\ncountry; a type which, in the letter to which you so unreasonably take\r\nexception, I showed not to be confined to any one class, but to exist\r\namong some representatives of great capitalists as well as among some\r\nrepresentatives of wage-workers. In that letter I condemned both types.\r\nCertain representatives of the great capitalists in turn condemned\r\nme for including Mr. Harriman in my condemnation of Messrs. Moyer and\r\nHaywood. Certain of the representatives of labor in their turn condemned\r\nme because I included Messrs. Moyer and Haywood as undesirable citizens\r\ntogether with Mr. Harrison. I am as profoundly indifferent to the\r\ncondemnation in one case as in the other. I challenge as a right the\r\nsupport of all good Americans, whether wage-workers or capitalists,\r\nwhatever their occupation or creed, or in whatever portion of the\r\ncountry they live, when I condemn both the types of bad citizenship\r\nwhich I have held up to reprobation. It seems to be a mark of utter\r\ninsincerity to fail thus to condemn both; and to apologize for either\r\nrobs the man thus apologizing of all right to condemn any wrongdoing in\r\nany man, rich or poor, in public or in private life.\r\n\r\nYou say you ask for a \"square deal\" for Messrs. Moyer and Haywood. So\r\ndo I. When I say \"Square deal,\" I mean a square deal to every one; it is\r\nequally a violation of the policy of the square deal for a capitalist to\r\nprotest against denunciation of a capitalist who is guilty of wrongdoing\r\nand for a labor leader to protest against the denunciation of a labor\r\nleader who has been guilty of wrongdoing. I stand for equal justice to\r\nboth; and so far as in my power lies I shall uphold justice, whether\r\nthe man accused of guilt has behind him the wealthiest corporation, the\r\ngreatest aggregations of riches in the country, or whether he has behind\r\nhim the most influential labor organization in the country.\r\n\r\nI treated anarchists and the bomb-throwing and dynamiting gentry\r\nprecisely as I treated other criminals. Murder is murder. It is not\r\nrendered one whit better by the allegation that it is committed\r\non behalf of \"a cause.\" It is true that law and order are not all\r\nsufficient; but they are essential; lawlessness and murderous violence\r\nmust be quelled before any permanence of reform can be obtained. Yet\r\nwhen they have been quelled, the beneficiaries of the enforcement of\r\nlaw must in their turn be taught that law is upheld as a means to the\r\nenforcement of justice, and that we will not tolerate its being turned\r\ninto an engine of injustice and oppression. The fundamental need in\r\ndealing with our people, whether laboring men or others, is not charity\r\nbut justice; we must all work in common for the common end of\r\nhelping each and all, in a spirit of the sanest, broadest and deepest\r\nbrotherhood.\r\n\r\nIt was not always easy to avoid feeling very deep anger with the\r\nselfishness and short-sightedness shown both by the representatives of\r\ncertain employers' organizations and by certain great labor federations\r\nor unions. One such employers' association was called the National\r\nAssociation of Manufacturers. Extreme though the attacks sometimes made\r\nupon me by the extreme labor organizations were, they were not quite\r\nas extreme as the attacks made upon me by the head of the National\r\nAssociation of Manufacturers, and as regards their attitude toward\r\nlegislation I came to the conclusion toward the end of my term that the\r\nlatter had actually gone further the wrong way than did the former--and\r\nthe former went a good distance also. The opposition of the National\r\nAssociation of Manufacturers to every rational and moderate measure\r\nfor benefiting workingmen, such as measures abolishing child labor, or\r\nsecuring workmen's compensation, caused me real and grave concern; for\r\nI felt that it was ominous of evil for the whole country to have men who\r\nought to stand high in wisdom and in guiding force take a course and use\r\nlanguage of such reactionary type as directly to incite revolution--for\r\nthis is what the extreme reactionary always does.\r\n\r\nOften I was attacked by the two sides at once. In the spring of 1906 I\r\nreceived in the same mail a letter from a very good friend of mine who\r\nthought that I had been unduly hard on some labor men, and a letter from\r\nanother friend, the head of a great corporation, who complained about me\r\nfor both favoring labor and speaking against large fortunes. My answers\r\nran as follows:\r\n\r\nApril 26, 1906.\r\n\r\n\"Personal. _My dear Doctor_:\r\n\r\n\"In one of my last letters to you I enclosed you a copy of a letter of\r\nmine, in which I quoted from [So and so's] advocacy of murder. You may\r\nbe interested to know that he and his brother Socialists--in reality\r\nanarchists--of the frankly murderous type have been violently attacking\r\nmy speech because of my allusion to the sympathy expressed for murder.\r\nIn _The Socialist_, of Toledo, Ohio, of April 21st, for instance, the\r\nattack [on me] is based specifically on the following paragraph of my\r\nspeech, to which he takes violent exception:\r\n\r\n\"We can no more and no less afford to condone evil in the man of capital\r\nthan evil in the man of no capital. The wealthy man who exults because\r\nthere is a failure of justice in the effort to bring some trust magnate\r\nto an account for his misdeeds is as bad as, and no worse than, the\r\nso-called labor leader who clamorously strives to excite a foul class\r\nfeeling on behalf of some other labor leader who is implicated in\r\nmurder. One attitude is as bad as the other, and no worse; in each case\r\nthe accused is entitled to exact justice; and in neither case is there\r\nneed of action by others which can be construed into an expression of\r\nsympathy for crime.\r\n\r\n\"Remember that this crowd of labor leaders have done all in their\r\npower to overawe the executive and the courts of Idaho on behalf of men\r\naccused of murder, and beyond question inciters of murder in the past.\"\r\n\r\nApril 26, 1906.\r\n\r\n\"_My dear Judge_:\r\n\r\n\"I wish the papers had given more prominence to what I said as to the\r\nmurder part of my speech. But oh, my dear sir, I utterly and radically\r\ndisagree with you in what you say about large fortunes. I wish it were\r\nin my power to devise some scheme to make it increasingly difficult to\r\nheap them up beyond a certain amount. As the difficulties in the way\r\nof such a scheme are very great, let us at least prevent their being\r\nbequeathed after death or given during life to any one man in excessive\r\namount.\r\n\r\n\"You and other capitalist friends, on one side, shy off at what I say\r\nagainst them. Have you seen the frantic articles against me by [the\r\nanarchists and] the Socialists of the bomb-throwing persuasion, on the\r\nother side, because of what I said in my speech in reference to those\r\nwho, in effect, advocate murder?\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion I was vehemently denounced in certain capitalistic\r\npapers because I had a number of labor leaders, including miners from\r\nButte, lunch with me at the White House; and this at the very time that\r\nthe Western Federation of Miners was most ferocious in its denunciation\r\nof me because of what it alleged to be my unfriendly attitude toward\r\nlabor. To one of my critics I set forth my views in the following\r\nletter:\r\n\r\nNovember 26, 1903.\r\n\r\n\"I have your letter of the 25th instant, with enclosure. These men, not\r\nall of whom were miners, by the way, came here and were at lunch with\r\nme, in company with Mr. Carroll D. Wright, Mr. Wayne MacVeagh, and\r\nSecretary Cortelyou. They are as decent a set of men as can be. They all\r\nagreed entirely with me in my denunciation of what had been done in the\r\nCourt d'Alene country; and it appeared that some of them were on the\r\nplatform with me when I denounced this type of outrage three years ago\r\nin Butte. There is not one man who was here, who, I believe, was in\r\nany way, shape or form responsible for such outrages. I find that the\r\nultra-Socialistic members of the unions in Butte denounced these men for\r\ncoming here, in a manner as violent--and I may say as irrational--as the\r\ndenunciation [by the capitalistic writer] in the article you sent me.\r\nDoubtless the gentleman of whom you speak as your general manager is\r\nan admirable man. I, of course, was not alluding to him; but I most\r\nemphatically _was_ alluding to men who write such articles as that you\r\nsent me. These articles are to be paralleled by the similar articles in\r\nthe Populist and Socialist papers when two years ago I had at dinner\r\nat one time Pierpont Morgan, and at another time J. J. Hill, and at\r\nanother, Harriman, and at another time Schiff. Furthermore, they could\r\nbe paralleled by the articles in the same type of paper which at the\r\ntime of the Miller incident in the Printing Office were in a condition\r\nof nervous anxiety because I met the labor leaders to discuss it. It\r\nwould have been a great misfortune if I had not met them; and it would\r\nhave been an even greater misfortune if after meeting them I had yielded\r\nto their protests in the matter.\r\n\r\n\"You say in your letter that you know that I am 'on record' as opposed\r\nto violence. Pardon my saying that this seems to me not the right way to\r\nput the matter, if by 'record' you mean utterance and not action. Aside\r\nfrom what happened when I was Governor in connection, for instance with\r\nthe Croton dam strike riots, all you have to do is to turn back to what\r\ntook place last June in Arizona--and you can find out about it from\r\n[Mr. X] of New York. The miners struck, violence followed, and the\r\nArizona Territorial authorities notified me they could not grapple with\r\nthe situation. Within twenty minutes of the receipt of the telegram,\r\norders were issued to the nearest available troops, and twenty-four\r\nhours afterwards General Baldwin and his regulars were on the ground,\r\nand twenty-four hours later every vestige of disorder had disappeared.\r\nThe Miners' Federation in their meeting, I think at Denver, a short\r\nwhile afterwards, passed resolutions denouncing me. I do not know\r\nwhether the _Mining and Engineering Journal_ paid any heed to this\r\nincident or know of it. If the _Journal_ did, I suppose it can hardly\r\nhave failed to understand that to put an immediate stop to rioting by\r\nthe use of the United States army is a fact of importance beside which\r\nthe criticism of my having 'labor leaders' to lunch, shrinks into the\r\nsame insignificance as the criticism in a different type of paper about\r\nmy having 'trust magnates' to lunch. While I am President I wish the\r\nlabor man to feel that he has the same right of access to me that the\r\ncapitalist has; that the doors swing open as easily to the wage-worker\r\nas to the head of a big corporation--_and no easier_. Anything else\r\nseems to be not only un-American, but as symptomatic of an attitude\r\nwhich will cost grave trouble if persevered in. To discriminate against\r\nlabor men from Butte because there is reason to believe that rioting has\r\nbeen excited in other districts by certain labor unions, or individuals\r\nin labor unions in Butte, would be to adopt precisely the attitude of\r\nthose who desire me to discriminate against all capitalists in Wall\r\nstreet because there are plenty of capitalists in Wall Street who\r\nhave been guilty of bad financial practices and who have endeavored to\r\noverride or evade the laws of the land. In my judgment, the only safe\r\nattitude for a private citizen, and still more for a public servant, to\r\nassume, is that he will draw the line on conduct, discriminating against\r\nneither corporation nor union as such, nor in favor of either as such,\r\nbut endeavoring to make the decent member of the union and the upright\r\ncapitalists alike feel that they are bound, not only by self-interest,\r\nbut by every consideration of principle and duty to stand together on\r\nthe matters of most moment to the nation.\"\r\n\r\nOn another of the various occasions when I had labor leaders to dine\r\nat the White House, my critics were rather shocked because I had John\r\nMorley to meet them. The labor leaders in question included the heads\r\nof the various railroad brotherhoods, men like Mr. Morrissey, in\r\nwhose sound judgment and high standard of citizenship I had peculiar\r\nconfidence; and I asked Mr. Morley to meet them because they represented\r\nthe exact type of American citizen with whom I thought he ought to be\r\nbrought in contact.\r\n\r\nOne of the devices sometimes used by big corporations to break down the\r\nlaw was to treat the passage of laws as an excuse for action on their\r\npart which they knew would be resented by the public, it being their\r\npurpose to turn this resentment against the law instead of against\r\nthemselves. The heads of the Louisville and Nashville road were bitter\r\nopponents of everything done by the Government toward securing good\r\ntreatment for their employees. In February, 1908, they and various\r\nother railways announced that they intended to reduce the wages of\r\ntheir employees. A general strike, with all the attendant disorder and\r\ntrouble, was threatened in consequence. I accordingly sent the following\r\nopen letter to the Inter-State Commerce Commission:\r\n\r\nFebruary 16, 1908.\r\n\r\n\"To the Inter-State Commerce Commission:\r\n\r\n\"I am informed that a number of railroad companies have served notice\r\nof a proposed reduction of wages of their employees. One of them, the\r\nLouisville and Nashville, in announcing the reduction, states that 'the\r\ndrastic laws inimical to the interests of the railroads that have in the\r\npast year or two been enacted by Congress and the State Legislatures'\r\nare largely or chiefly responsible for the conditions requiring the\r\nreduction.\r\n\r\n\"Under such circumstances it is possible that the public may soon be\r\nconfronted by serious industrial disputes, and the law provides that in\r\nsuch case either party may demand the services of your Chairman and\r\nof the Commissioner of Labor as a Board of Mediation and Conciliation.\r\nThese reductions in wages may be warranted, or they may not. As to this\r\nthe public, which is a vitally interested party, can form no judgment\r\nwithout a more complete knowledge of the essential facts and real merits\r\nof the case than it now has or than it can possibly obtain from the\r\nspecial pleadings, certain to be put forth by each side in case their\r\ndispute should bring about serious interruption to traffic. If the\r\nreduction in wages is due to natural causes, the loss of business being\r\nsuch that the burden should be and is, equitably distributed between\r\ncapitalist and wage-worker, the public should know it. If it is caused\r\nby legislation, the public, and Congress, should know it; and if it is\r\ncaused by misconduct in the past financial or other operations of any\r\nrailroad, then everybody should know it, especially if the excuse of\r\nunfriendly legislation is advanced as a method of covering up past\r\nbusiness misconduct by the railroad managers, or as a justification for\r\nfailure to treat fairly the wage-earning employees of the company.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, an industrial conflict between a railroad corporation and\r\nits employees offers peculiar opportunities to any small number of\r\nevil-disposed persons to destroy life and property and foment public\r\ndisorder. Of course, if life, property, and public order are endangered,\r\nprompt and drastic measures for their protection become the first plain\r\nduty. All other issues then become subordinate to the preservation of\r\nthe public peace, and the real merits of the original controversy are\r\nnecessarily lost from view. This vital consideration should be ever\r\nkept in mind by all law-abiding and far-sighted members of labor\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\n\"It is sincerely to be hoped, therefore, that any wage controversy that\r\nmay arise between the railroads and their employees may find a peaceful\r\nsolution through the methods of conciliation and arbitration already\r\nprovided by Congress, which have proven so effective during the past\r\nyear. To this end the Commission should be in a position to have\r\navailable for any Board of Conciliation or Arbitration relevant data\r\npertaining to such carriers as may become involved in industrial\r\ndisputes. Should conciliation fail to effect a settlement and\r\narbitration be rejected, accurate information should be available in\r\norder to develop a properly informed public opinion.\r\n\r\n\"I therefore ask you to make such investigation, both of your records\r\nand by any other means at your command, as will enable you to furnish\r\ndata concerning such conditions obtaining on the Louisville and\r\nNashville and any other roads, as may relate, directly or indirectly, to\r\nthe real merits of the possibly impending controversy.\r\n\r\n\"THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter achieved its purpose, and the threatened reduction of\r\nwages was not made. It was an instance of what could be accomplished\r\nby governmental action. Let me add, however, with all the emphasis I\r\npossess, that this does not mean any failure on my part to recognize the\r\nfact that if governmental action places too heavy burdens on railways,\r\nit will be impossible for them to operate without doing injustice to\r\nsomebody. Railways cannot pay proper wages and render proper service\r\nunless they make money. The investors must get a reasonable profit or\r\nthey will not invest, and the public cannot be well served unless the\r\ninvestors are making reasonable profits. There is every reason why rates\r\nshould not be too high, but they must be sufficiently high to allow\r\nthe railways to pay good wages. Moreover, when laws like workmen's\r\ncompensation laws, and the like are passed, it must always be kept in\r\nmind by the Legislature that the purpose is to distribute over the whole\r\ncommunity a burden that should not be borne only by those least able\r\nto bear it--that is, by the injured man or the widow and orphans of the\r\ndead man. If the railway is already receiving a disproportionate return\r\nfrom the public, then the burden may, with propriety, bear purely on the\r\nrailway; but if it is not earning a disproportionate return, then the\r\npublic must bear its share of the burden of the increased service the\r\nrailway is rendering. Dividends and wages should go up together; and the\r\nrelation of rates to them should never be forgotten. This of course does\r\nnot apply to dividends based on water; nor does it mean that if foolish\r\npeople have built a road that renders no service, the public must\r\nnevertheless in some way guarantee a return on the investment; but it\r\ndoes mean that the interests of the honest investor are entitled to\r\nthe same protection as the interests of the honest manager, the honest\r\nshipper and the honest wage-earner. All these conflicting considerations\r\nshould be carefully considered by Legislatures before passing laws. One\r\nof the great objects in creating commissions should be the provision of\r\ndisinterested, fair-minded experts who will really and wisely consider\r\nall these matters, and will shape their actions accordingly. This is one\r\nreason why such matters as the regulation of rates, the provision for\r\nfull crews on roads and the like should be left for treatment by railway\r\ncommissions, and not be settled off hand by direct legislative action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nSOCIALISM\r\n\r\nAs regards what I have said in this chapter concerning Socialism, I\r\nwish to call especial attention to the admirable book on \"Marxism versus\r\nSocialism,\" which has just been published by Vladimir D. Simkhovitch.\r\nWhat I have, here and elsewhere, merely pointed out in rough and\r\nready fashion from actual observation of the facts of life around me,\r\nProfessor Simkhovitch in his book has discussed with keen practical\r\ninsight, with profundity of learning, and with a wealth of applied\r\nphilosophy. Crude thinkers in the United States, and moreover honest and\r\nintelligent men who are not crude thinkers, but who are oppressed by\r\nthe sight of the misery around them and have not deeply studied what has\r\nbeen done elsewhere, are very apt to adopt as their own the theories\r\nof European Marxian Socialists of half a century ago, ignorant that the\r\ncourse of events has so completely falsified the prophecies contained\r\nin these theories that they have been abandoned even by the authors\r\nthemselves. With quiet humor Professor Simkhovitch now and then makes\r\nan allusion which shows that he appreciates to perfection this rather\r\ncurious quality of some of our fellow countrymen; as for example when\r\nhe says that \"A Socialist State with the farmer outside of it is a\r\nconception that can rest comfortably only in the head of an American\r\nSocialist,\" or as when he speaks of Marx and Engels as men \"to whom\r\nthinking was not an irrelevant foreign tradition.\" Too many thoroughly\r\nwell-meaning men and women in the America of to-day glibly repeat and\r\naccept--much as medieval schoolmen repeated and accepted authorized\r\ndogma in their day--various assumptions and speculations by Marx and\r\nothers which by the lapse of time and by actual experiment have been\r\nshown to possess not one shred of value. Professor Simkhovitch possesses\r\nthe gift of condensation as well as the gift of clear and logical\r\nstatement, and it is not possible to give in brief any idea of his\r\nadmirable work. Every social reformer who desires to face facts should\r\nstudy it--just as social reformers should study John Graham Brooks's\r\n\"American Syndicalism.\" From Professor Simkhovitch's book we Americans\r\nshould learn: First, to discard crude thinking; second, to realize that\r\nthe orthodox or so-called scientific or purely economic or materialistic\r\nsocialism of the type preached by Marx is an exploded theory; and,\r\nthird, that many of the men who call themselves Socialists to-day are in\r\nreality merely radical social reformers, with whom on many points good\r\ncitizens can and ought to work in hearty general agreement, and whom\r\nin many practical matters of government good citizens well afford to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE MONROE DOCTRINE AND THE PANAMA CANAL\r\n\r\nNo nation can claim rights without acknowledging the duties that go\r\nwith the rights. It is a contemptible thing for a great nation to render\r\nitself impotent in international action, whether because of cowardice or\r\nsloth, or sheer inability or unwillingness to look into the future. It\r\nis a very wicked thing for a nation to do wrong to others. But the most\r\ncontemptible and most wicked course of conduct is for a nation to use\r\noffensive language or be guilty of offensive actions toward other people\r\nand yet fail to hold its own if the other nation retaliates; and it is\r\nalmost as bad to undertake responsibilities and then not fulfil them.\r\nDuring the seven and a half years that I was President, this Nation\r\nbehaved in international matters toward all other nations precisely as\r\nan honorable man behaves to his fellow-men. We made no promise which\r\nwe could not and did not keep. We made no threat which we did not carry\r\nout. We never failed to assert our rights in the face of the strong, and\r\nwe never failed to treat both strong and weak with courtesy and justice;\r\nand against the weak when they misbehaved we were slower to assert our\r\nrights than we were against the strong.\r\n\r\nAs a legacy of the Spanish War we were left with peculiar relations\r\nto the Philippines, Cuba, and Porto Rico, and with an immensely added\r\ninterest in Central America and the Caribbean Sea. As regards the\r\nPhilippines my belief was that we should train them for self-government\r\nas rapidly as possible, and then leave them free to decide their own\r\nfate. I did not believe in setting the time-limit within which we would\r\ngive them independence, because I did not believe it wise to try to\r\nforecast how soon they would be fit for self-government; and once having\r\nmade the promise I would have felt that it was imperative to keep it.\r\nWithin a few months of my assuming office we had stamped out the last\r\narmed resistance in the Philippines that was not of merely sporadic\r\ncharacter; and as soon as peace was secured we turned our energies to\r\ndeveloping the islands in the interests of the natives. We established\r\nschools everywhere; we built roads; we administered an even-handed\r\njustice; we did everything possible to encourage agriculture and\r\nindustry; and in constantly increasing measure we employed natives to\r\ndo their own governing, and finally provided a legislative chamber. No\r\nhigher grade of public officials ever handled the affairs of any colony\r\nthan the public officials who in succession governed the Philippines.\r\nWith the possible exception of the Sudan, and not even excepting\r\nAlgiers, I know of no country ruled and administered by men of the white\r\nrace where that rule and that administration have been exercised\r\nso emphatically with an eye single to the welfare of the natives\r\nthemselves. The English and Dutch administrators of Malaysia have done\r\nadmirable work; but the profit to the Europeans in those States has\r\nalways been one of the chief elements considered; whereas in the\r\nPhilippines our whole attention was concentrated upon the welfare of the\r\nFilipinos themselves, if anything to the neglect of our own interests.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that America has any special beneficial interest in\r\nretaining the Philippines. Our work there has benefited us only as\r\nany efficiently done work performed for the benefit of others does\r\nincidentally help the character of those who do it. The people of the\r\nislands have never developed so rapidly, from every standpoint, as\r\nduring the years of the American occupation. The time will come when\r\nit will be wise to take their own judgment as to whether they wish to\r\ncontinue their association with America or not. There is, however,\r\none consideration upon which we should insist. Either we should\r\nretain complete control of the islands, or absolve ourselves from all\r\nresponsibility for them. Any half and half course would be both foolish\r\nand disastrous. We are governing and have been governing the islands\r\nin the interests of the Filipinos themselves. If after due time the\r\nFilipinos themselves decide that they do not wish to be thus governed,\r\nthen I trust that we will leave; but when we do leave it must be\r\ndistinctly understood that we retain no protectorate--and above all that\r\nwe take part in no joint protectorate--over the islands, and give\r\nthem no guarantee, of neutrality or otherwise; that, in short, we\r\nare absolutely quit of responsibility for them, of every kind and\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nThe Filipinos were quite incapable of standing by themselves when we\r\ntook possession of the islands, and we had made no promise concerning\r\nthem. But we had explicitly promised to leave the island of Cuba,\r\nhad explicitly promised that Cuba should be independent. Early in my\r\nadministration that promise was redeemed. When the promise was made,\r\nI doubt if there was a single ruler or diplomat in Europe who believed\r\nthat it would be kept. As far as I know, the United States was the first\r\npower which, having made such a promise, kept it in letter and spirit.\r\nEngland was unwise enough to make such a promise when she took Egypt.\r\nIt would have been a capital misfortune to have kept the promise,\r\nand England has remained in Egypt for over thirty years, and will\r\nunquestionably remain indefinitely; but though it is necessary for her\r\nto do so, the fact of her doing so has meant the breaking of a positive\r\npromise and has been a real evil. Japan made the same guarantee about\r\nKorea, but as far as can be seen there was never even any thought of\r\nkeeping the promise in this case; and Korea, which had shown herself\r\nutterly impotent either for self-government or self-defense, was in\r\nactual fact almost immediately annexed to Japan.\r\n\r\nWe made the promise to give Cuba independence; and we kept the promise.\r\nLeonard Wood was left in as Governor for two or three years, and evolved\r\norder out of chaos, raising the administration of the island to a level,\r\nmoral and material, which it had never before achieved. We also by\r\ntreaty gave the Cubans substantial advantages in our markets. Then we\r\nleft the island, turning the government over to its own people. After\r\nfour or five years a revolution broke out, during my administration, and\r\nwe again had to intervene to restore order. We promptly sent thither a\r\nsmall army of pacification. Under General Barry, order was restored and\r\nkept, and absolute justice done. The American troops were then withdrawn\r\nand the Cubans reestablished in complete possession of their own\r\nbeautiful island, and they are in possession of it now. There are plenty\r\nof occasions in our history when we have shown weakness or inefficiency,\r\nand some occasions when we have not been as scrupulous as we should have\r\nbeen as regards the rights of others. But I know of no action by\r\nany other government in relation to a weaker power which showed such\r\ndisinterested efficiency in rendering service as was true in connection\r\nwith our intervention in Cuba.\r\n\r\nIn Cuba, as in the Philippines and as in Porto Rico, Santo Domingo, and\r\nlater in Panama, no small part of our success was due to the fact that\r\nwe put in the highest grade of men as public officials. This practice\r\nwas inaugurated under President McKinley. I found admirable men in\r\noffice, and I continued them and appointed men like them as their\r\nsuccessors. The way that the custom-houses in Santo Domingo were\r\nadministered by Colton definitely established the success of our\r\nexperiment in securing peace for that island republic; and in Porto\r\nRico, under the administration of affairs under such officials as Hunt,\r\nWinthrop, Post, Ward and Grahame, more substantial progress was achieved\r\nin a decade than in any previous century.\r\n\r\nThe Philippines, Cuba, and Porto Rico came within our own sphere of\r\ngovernmental action. In addition to this we asserted certain rights in\r\nthe Western Hemisphere under the Monroe Doctrine. My endeavor was not\r\nonly to assert these rights, but frankly and fully to acknowledge the\r\nduties that went with the rights.\r\n\r\nThe Monroe Doctrine lays down the rule that the Western Hemisphere is\r\nnot hereafter to be treated as subject to settlement and occupation\r\nby Old World powers. It is not international law; but it is a cardinal\r\nprinciple of our foreign policy. There is no difficulty at the present\r\nday in maintaining this doctrine, save where the American power whose\r\ninterest is threatened has shown itself in international matters both\r\nweak and delinquent. The great and prosperous civilized commonwealths,\r\nsuch as the Argentine, Brazil, and Chile, in the Southern half of South\r\nAmerica, have advanced so far that they no longer stand in any position\r\nof tutelage toward the United States. They occupy toward us precisely\r\nthe position that Canada occupies. Their friendship is the friendship of\r\nequals for equals. My view was that as regards these nations there was\r\nno more necessity for asserting the Monroe Doctrine than there was to\r\nassert it in regard to Canada. They were competent to assert it for\r\nthemselves. Of course if one of these nations, or if Canada, should be\r\novercome by some Old World power, which then proceeded to occupy its\r\nterritory, we would undoubtedly, if the American Nation needed our help,\r\ngive it in order to prevent such occupation from taking place. But the\r\ninitiative would come from the Nation itself, and the United States\r\nwould merely act as a friend whose help was invoked.\r\n\r\nThe case was (and is) widely different as regards certain--not all--of\r\nthe tropical states in the neighborhood of the Caribbean Sea. Where\r\nthese states are stable and prosperous, they stand on a footing of\r\nabsolute equality with all other communities. But some of them have\r\nbeen a prey to such continuous revolutionary misrule as to have grown\r\nimpotent either to do their duties to outsiders or to enforce their\r\nrights against outsiders. The United States has not the slightest desire\r\nto make aggressions on any one of these states. On the contrary, it\r\nwill submit to much from them without showing resentment. If any great\r\ncivilized power, Russia or Germany, for instance, had behaved toward us\r\nas Venezuela under Castro behaved, this country would have gone to war\r\nat once. We did not go to war with Venezuela merely because our people\r\ndeclined to be irritated by the actions of a weak opponent, and showed a\r\nforbearance which probably went beyond the limits of wisdom in refusing\r\nto take umbrage at what was done by the weak; although we would\r\ncertainly have resented it had it been done by the strong. In the case\r\nof two states, however, affairs reached such a crisis that we had to\r\nact. These two states were Santo Domingo and the then owner of the\r\nIsthmus of Panama, Colombia.\r\n\r\nThe Santo Domingan case was the less important; and yet it possessed a\r\nreal importance, and moreover is instructive because the action there\r\ntaken should serve as a precedent for American action in all similar\r\ncases. During the early years of my administration Santo Domingo was in\r\nits usual condition of chronic revolution. There was always fighting,\r\nalways plundering; and the successful graspers for governmental power\r\nwere always pawning ports and custom-houses, or trying to put them up as\r\nguarantees for loans. Of course the foreigners who made loans under\r\nsuch conditions demanded exorbitant interest, and if they were Europeans\r\nexpected their governments to stand by them. So utter was the disorder\r\nthat on one occasion when Admiral Dewey landed to pay a call of ceremony\r\non the President, he and his party were shot at by revolutionists in\r\ncrossing the square, and had to return to the ships, leaving the call\r\nunpaid. There was default on the interest due to the creditors; and\r\nfinally the latter insisted upon their governments intervening. Two or\r\nthree of the European powers were endeavoring to arrange for concerted\r\naction, and I was finally notified that these powers intended to take\r\nand hold several of the seaports which held custom-houses.\r\n\r\nThis meant that unless I acted at once I would find foreign powers in\r\npartial possession of Santo Domingo; in which event the very individuals\r\nwho, in the actual event deprecated the precaution taken to prevent such\r\naction, would have advocated extreme and violent measures to undo the\r\neffect of their own supineness. Nine-tenths of wisdom is to be wise in\r\ntime, and at the right time; and my whole foreign policy was based\r\non the exercise of intelligent forethought and of decisive action\r\nsufficiently far in advance of any likely crisis to make it improbable\r\nthat we would run into serious trouble.\r\n\r\nSanto Domingo had fallen into such chaos that once for some weeks there\r\nwere two rival governments in it, and a revolution was being carried\r\non against each. At one period one government was at sea in a small\r\ngunboat, but still stoutly maintained that it was in possession of\r\nthe island and entitled to make loans and declare peace or war. The\r\nsituation had become intolerable by the time that I interfered. There\r\nwas a naval commander in the waters whom I directed to prevent any\r\nfighting which might menace the custom-houses. He carried out his\r\norders, both to his and my satisfaction, in thoroughgoing fashion. On\r\none occasion, when an insurgent force threatened to attack a town in\r\nwhich Americans had interests, he notified the commanders on both sides\r\nthat he would not permit any fighting in the town, but that he would\r\nappoint a certain place where they could meet and fight it out, and that\r\nthe victors should have the town. They agreed to meet his wishes,\r\nthe fight came off at the appointed place, and the victors, who if I\r\nremember rightly were the insurgents, were given the town.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom-houses that caused the trouble, for they offered the\r\nonly means of raising money, and the revolutions were carried on to\r\nget possession of them. Accordingly I secured an agreement with the\r\ngovernmental authorities, who for the moment seemed best able to speak\r\nfor the country, by which these custom-houses were placed under American\r\ncontrol. The arrangement was that we should keep order and prevent any\r\ninterference with the custom-houses or the places where they stood, and\r\nshould collect the revenues. Forty-five per cent of the revenue was then\r\nturned over to the Santo Domingan Government, and fifty-five per cent\r\nput in a sinking fund in New York for the benefit of the creditors. The\r\narrangement worked in capital style. On the forty-five per cent basis\r\nthe Santo Domingan Government received from us a larger sum than it\r\nhad ever received before when nominally all the revenue went to it. The\r\ncreditors were entirely satisfied with the arrangement, and no excuse\r\nfor interference by European powers remained. Occasional disturbances\r\noccurred in the island, of course, but on the whole there ensued a\r\ndegree of peace and prosperity which the island had not known before for\r\nat least a century.\r\n\r\nAll this was done without the loss of a life, with the assent of all\r\nthe parties in interest, and without subjecting the United States to\r\nany charge, while practically all of the interference, after the\r\nnaval commander whom I have mentioned had taken the initial steps in\r\npreserving order, consisted in putting a first-class man trained in our\r\ninsular service at the head of the Santo Domingan customs service. We\r\nsecured peace, we protected the people of the islands against foreign\r\nfoes, and we minimized the chance of domestic trouble. We satisfied the\r\ncreditors and the foreign nations to which the creditors belonged; and\r\nour own part of the work was done with the utmost efficiency and with\r\nrigid honesty, so that not a particle of scandal was ever so much as\r\nhinted at.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances those who do not know the nature of the\r\nprofessional international philanthropists would suppose that these\r\napostles of international peace would have been overjoyed with what we\r\nhad done. As a matter of fact, when they took any notice of it at all it\r\nwas to denounce it; and those American newspapers which are fondest\r\nof proclaiming themselves the foes of war and the friends of peace\r\nviolently attacked me for averting war from, and bringing peace to, the\r\nisland. They insisted I had no power to make the agreement, and demanded\r\nthe rejection of the treaty which was to perpetuate the agreement. They\r\nwere, of course, wholly unable to advance a single sound reason of any\r\nkind for their attitude. I suppose the real explanation was partly their\r\ndislike of me personally, and unwillingness to see peace come through or\r\nnational honor upheld by me; and in the next place their sheer, simple\r\ndevotion to prattle and dislike of efficiency. They liked to have people\r\ncome together and talk about peace, or even sign bits of paper with\r\nsomething about peace or arbitration on them, but they took no interest\r\nwhatever in the practical achievement of a peace that told for good\r\ngovernment and decency and honesty. They were joined by the many\r\nmoderately well-meaning men who always demand that a thing be done, but\r\nalso always demand that it be not done in the only way in which it is,\r\nas a matter of fact, possible to do it. The men of this kind insisted\r\nthat of course Santo Domingo must be protected and made to behave\r\nitself, and that of course the Panama Canal must be dug; but they\r\ninsisted even more strongly that neither feat should be accomplished in\r\nthe only way in which it was possible to accomplish it at all.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution did not explicitly give me power to bring about the\r\nnecessary agreement with Santo Domingo. But the Constitution did not\r\nforbid my doing what I did. I put the agreement into effect, and I\r\ncontinued its execution for two years before the Senate acted; and I\r\nwould have continued it until the end of my term, if necessary, without\r\nany action by Congress. But it was far preferable that there should be\r\naction by Congress, so that we might be proceeding under a treaty which\r\nwas the law of the land and not merely by a direction of the Chief\r\nExecutive which would lapse when that particular executive left office.\r\nI therefore did my best to get the Senate to ratify what I had done.\r\nThere was a good deal of difficulty about it. With the exception of one\r\nor two men like Clark of Arkansas, the Democratic Senators acted in that\r\nspirit of unworthy partisanship which subordinates national interest to\r\nsome fancied partisan advantage, and they were cordially backed by all\r\nthat portion of the press which took its inspiration from Wall Street,\r\nand was violently hostile to the Administration because of its attitude\r\ntowards great corporations. Most of the Republican Senators under\r\nthe lead of Senator Lodge stood by me; but some of them, of the more\r\n\"conservative\" or reactionary type, who were already growing hostile\r\nto me on the trust question, first proceeded to sneer at what had\r\nbeen done, and to raise all kinds of meticulous objections, which they\r\nthemselves finally abandoned, but which furnished an excuse on which\r\nthe opponents of the treaty could hang adverse action. Unfortunately the\r\nSenators who were most apt to speak of the dignity of the Senate, and to\r\ninsist upon its importance, were the very ones who were also most apt\r\nto try to make display of this dignity and importance by thwarting the\r\npublic business. This case was typical. The Republicans in question\r\nspoke against certain provisions of the proposed treaty. They then,\r\nhaving ingeniously provided ammunition for the foes of the treaty,\r\nabandoned their opposition to it, and the Democrats stepped into the\r\nposition they had abandoned. Enough Republicans were absent to prevent\r\nthe securing of a two-thirds vote for the treaty, and the Senate\r\nadjourned without any action at all, and with a feeling of entire\r\nself-satisfaction at having left the country in the position of assuming\r\na responsibility and then failing to fulfil it. Apparently the Senators\r\nin question felt that in some way they had upheld their dignity. All\r\nthat they had really done was to shirk their duty. Somebody had to do\r\nthat duty, and accordingly I did it. I went ahead and administered the\r\nproposed treaty anyhow, considering it as a simple agreement on the part\r\nof the Executive which would be converted into a treaty whenever\r\nthe Senate acted. After a couple of years the Senate did act, having\r\npreviously made some utterly unimportant changes which I ratified and\r\npersuaded Santo Domingo to ratify. In all its history Santo Domingo has\r\nhad nothing happen to it as fortunate as this treaty, and the passing of\r\nit saved the United States from having to face serious difficulties with\r\none or more foreign powers.\r\n\r\nIt cannot in the long run prove possible for the United States\r\nto protect delinquent American nations from punishment for the\r\nnon-performance of their duties unless she undertakes to make them\r\nperform their duties. People may theorize about this as much as\r\nthey wish, but whenever a sufficiently strong outside nation becomes\r\nsufficiently aggrieved, then either that nation will act or the United\r\nStates Government itself will have to act. We were face to face at one\r\nperiod of my administration with this condition of affairs in Venezuela,\r\nwhen Germany, rather feebly backed by England, undertook a blockade\r\nagainst Venezuela to make Venezuela adopt the German and English view\r\nabout certain agreements. There was real danger that the blockade would\r\nfinally result in Germany's taking possession of certain cities or\r\ncustom-houses. I succeeded, however, in getting all the parties in\r\ninterest to submit their cases to the Hague Tribunal.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important action I took in foreign affairs during the\r\ntime I was President related to the Panama Canal. Here again there was\r\nmuch accusation about my having acted in an \"unconstitutional\" manner--a\r\nposition which can be upheld only if Jefferson's action in acquiring\r\nLouisiana be also treated as unconstitutional; and at different stages\r\nof the affair believers in a do-nothing policy denounced me as having\r\n\"usurped authority\"--which meant, that when nobody else could or would\r\nexercise efficient authority, I exercised it.\r\n\r\nDuring the nearly four hundred years that had elapsed since Balboa\r\ncrossed the Isthmus, there had been a good deal of talk about building\r\nan Isthmus canal, and there had been various discussions of the subject\r\nand negotiations about it in Washington for the previous half century.\r\nSo far it had all resulted merely in conversation; and the time had come\r\nwhen unless somebody was prepared to act with decision we would have\r\nto resign ourselves to at least half a century of further conversation.\r\nUnder the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty signed shortly after I became President,\r\nand thanks to our negotiations with the French Panama Company, the\r\nUnited States at last acquired a possession, so far as Europe was\r\nconcerned, which warranted her in immediately undertaking the task. It\r\nremained to decide where the canal should be, whether along the line\r\nalready pioneered by the French company in Panama, or in Nicaragua.\r\nPanama belonged to the Republic of Colombia. Nicaragua bid eagerly for\r\nthe privilege of having the United States build the canal through her\r\nterritory. As long as it was doubtful which route we would decide\r\nupon, Colombia extended every promise of friendly cooperation; at the\r\nPan-American Congress in Mexico her delegate joined in the unanimous\r\nvote which requested the United States forthwith to build the canal; and\r\nat her eager request we negotiated the Hay-Herran Treaty with her, which\r\ngave us the right to build the canal across Panama. A board of experts\r\nsent to the Isthmus had reported that this route was better than the\r\nNicaragua route, and that it would be well to build the canal over it\r\nprovided we could purchase the rights of the French company for forty\r\nmillion dollars; but that otherwise they would advise taking the\r\nNicaragua route. Ever since 1846 we had had a treaty with the power then\r\nin control of the Isthmus, the Republic of New Granada, the predecessor\r\nof the Republic of Colombia and of the present Republic of Panama, by\r\nwhich treaty the United States was guaranteed free and open right of way\r\nacross the Isthmus of Panama by any mode of communication that might\r\nbe constructed, while in return our Government guaranteed the perfect\r\nneutrality of the Isthmus with a view to the preservation of free\r\ntransit.\r\n\r\nFor nearly fifty years we had asserted the right to prevent the closing\r\nof this highway of commerce. Secretary of State Cass in 1858 officially\r\nstated the American position as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Sovereignty has its duties as well as its rights, and none of these\r\nlocal governments, even if administered with more regard to the just\r\ndemands of other nations than they have been, would be permitted, in a\r\nspirit of Eastern isolation, to close the gates of intercourse of the\r\ngreat highways of the world, and justify the act by the pretension that\r\nthese avenues of trade and travel belong to them and that they choose\r\nto shut them, or, what is almost equivalent, to encumber them with such\r\nunjust relations as would prevent their general use.\"\r\n\r\nWe had again and again been forced to intervene to protect the transit\r\nacross the Isthmus, and the intervention was frequently at the request\r\nof Colombia herself. The effort to build a canal by private capital had\r\nbeen made under De Lesseps and had resulted in lamentable failure. Every\r\nserious proposal to build the canal in such manner had been abandoned.\r\nThe United States had repeatedly announced that we would not permit\r\nit to be built or controlled by any old-world government. Colombia was\r\nutterly impotent to build it herself. Under these circumstances it\r\nhad become a matter of imperative obligation that we should build it\r\nourselves without further delay.\r\n\r\nI took final action in 1903. During the preceding fifty-three years the\r\nGovernments of New Granada and of its successor, Colombia, had been in\r\na constant state of flux; and the State of Panama had sometimes been\r\ntreated as almost independent, in a loose Federal league, and sometimes\r\nas the mere property of the Government at Bogota; and there had been\r\ninnumerable appeals to arms, sometimes of adequate, sometimes for\r\ninadequate, reasons. The following is a partial list of the disturbances\r\non the Isthmus of Panama during the period in question, as reported to\r\nus by our consuls. It is not possible to give a complete list, and\r\nsome of the reports that speak of \"revolutions\" must mean unsuccessful\r\nrevolutions:\r\n\r\nMay 22, 1850.--Outbreak; two Americans killed. War vessel demanded to\r\nquell outbreak.\r\n\r\nOctober, 1850.--Revolutionary plot to bring about independence of the\r\nIsthmus.\r\n\r\nJuly 22, 1851.--Revolution in four Southern provinces.\r\n\r\nNovember 14, 1851.--Outbreak at Chagres. Man-of-war requested for\r\nChagres.\r\n\r\nJune 27, 1853.--Insurrection at Bogota, and consequent disturbance on\r\nIsthmus. War vessel demanded.\r\n\r\nMay 23, 1854.--Political disturbances. War vessel requested.\r\n\r\nJune 28, 1854.--Attempted revolution.\r\n\r\nOctober 24, 1854.--Independence of Isthmus demanded by provincial\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nApril, 1856.--Riot, and massacre of Americans.\r\n\r\nMay 4, 1856.--Riot.\r\n\r\nMay 18, 1856.--Riot.\r\n\r\nJune 3, 1856.--Riot.\r\n\r\nOctober 2, 1856.--Conflict between two native parties. United States\r\nforce landed.\r\n\r\nDecember 18, 1858.--Attempted secession of Panama.\r\n\r\nApril, 1859.--Riots.\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1860.--Outbreak.\r\n\r\nOctober 4, 1860.--Landing of United States forces in consequence.\r\n\r\nMay 23, 1861.--Intervention of the United States force required, by\r\nintendente.\r\n\r\nOctober 2, 1861.--Insurrection and civil war.\r\n\r\nApril 4, 1862.--Measures to prevent rebels crossing Isthmus.\r\n\r\nJune 13, 1862.--Mosquera's troops refused admittance to Panama.\r\n\r\nMarch, 1865.--Revolution, and United States troops landed.\r\n\r\nAugust, 1865.--Riots; unsuccessful attempt to invade Panama.\r\n\r\nMarch, 1866.--Unsuccessful revolution.\r\n\r\nApril, 1867.--Attempt to overthrow Government.\r\n\r\nAugust, 1867.--Attempt at revolution.\r\n\r\nJuly 5, 1868.--Revolution; provisional government inaugurated.\r\n\r\nAugust 29, 1868.--Revolution; provisional government overthrown.\r\n\r\nApril, 1871.--Revolution; followed apparently by counter revolution.\r\n\r\nApril, 1873.--Revolution and civil war which lasted to October, 1875.\r\n\r\nAugust, 1876.--Civil war which lasted until April, 1877.\r\n\r\nJuly, 1878.--Rebellion.\r\n\r\nDecember, 1878.--Revolt.\r\n\r\nApril, 1879.--Revolution.\r\n\r\nJune, 1879.--Revolution.\r\n\r\nMarch, 1883.--Riot.\r\n\r\nMay, 1883.--Riot.\r\n\r\nJune, 1884.--Revolutionary attempt.\r\n\r\nDecember, 1884.--Revolutionary attempt.\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1885.--Revolutionary disturbances.\r\n\r\nMarch, 1885.--Revolution.\r\n\r\nApril, 1887.--Disturbance on Panama Railroad.\r\n\r\nNovember, 1887.--Disturbance on line of canal.\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1889.--Riot.\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1895.--Revolution which lasted until April.\r\n\r\nMarch, 1895.--Incendiary attempt.\r\n\r\nOctober, 1899.--Revolution.\r\n\r\nFebruary, 1900, to July, 1900.--Revolution.\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1901.--Revolution.\r\n\r\nJuly, 1901.--Revolutionary disturbances.\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1901.--City of Colon taken by rebels.\r\n\r\nMarch, 1902.--Revolutionary disturbances.\r\n\r\nJuly, 1902.--Revolution\r\n\r\nThe above is only a partial list of the revolutions, rebellions,\r\ninsurrections, riots, and other outbreaks that occurred during the\r\nperiod in question; yet they number fifty-three for the fifty-three\r\nyears, and they showed a tendency to increase, rather than decrease, in\r\nnumbers and intensity. One of them lasted for nearly three years before\r\nit was quelled; another for nearly a year. In short, the experience\r\nof over half a century had shown Colombia to be utterly incapable of\r\nkeeping order on the Isthmus. Only the active interference of the\r\nUnited States had enabled her to preserve so much as a semblance of\r\nsovereignty. Had it not been for the exercise by the United States of\r\nthe police power in her interest, her connection with the Isthmus would\r\nhave been sundered long before it was. In 1856, in 1860, in 1873, in\r\n1885, in 1901, and again in 1902, sailors and marines from United States\r\nwarships were forced to land in order to patrol the Isthmus, to protect\r\nlife and property, and to see that the transit across the Isthmus\r\nwas kept open. In 1861, in 1862, in 1885, and in 1900, the Colombian\r\nGovernment asked that the United States Government would land troops\r\nto protect Colombian interests and maintain order on the Isthmus. The\r\npeople of Panama during the preceding twenty years had three times\r\nsought to establish their independence by revolution or secession--in\r\n1885, in 1895, and in 1899.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar relations of the United States toward the Isthmus, and the\r\nacquiescence by Colombia in acts which were quite incompatible with the\r\ntheory of her having an absolute and unconditioned sovereignty on the\r\nIsthmus, are illustrated by the following three telegrams between two of\r\nour naval officers whose ships were at the Isthmus, and the Secretary\r\nof the Navy on the occasion of the first outbreak that occurred on\r\nthe Isthmus after I became President (a year before Panama became\r\nindependent):\r\n\r\nSeptember 12, 1902.\r\n\r\nRanger, Panama:\r\n\r\nUnited States guarantees perfect neutrality of Isthmus and that a free\r\ntransit from sea to sea be not interrupted or embarrassed. . . . Any\r\ntransportation of troops which might contravene these provisions of\r\ntreaty should not be sanctioned by you, nor should use of road be\r\npermitted which might convert the line of transit into theater of\r\nhostility.\r\n\r\nMOODY.\r\n\r\nCOLON, September 20, 1902.\r\n\r\nSecretary Navy, Washington:\r\n\r\nEverything is conceded. The United States guards and guarantees traffic\r\nand the line of transit. To-day I permitted the exchange of Colombian\r\ntroops from Panama to Colon, about 1000 men each way, the troops without\r\narms in trains guarded by American naval force in the same manner as\r\nother passengers; arms and ammunition in separate train, guarded also by\r\nnaval force in the same manner as other freight.\r\n\r\nMCLEAN.\r\n\r\nPANAMA, October 3, 1902.\r\n\r\nSecretary Navy, Washington, D.C.:\r\n\r\nHave sent this communication to the American Consul at Panama:\r\n\r\n\"Inform Governor, while trains running under United States protection,\r\nI must decline transportation any combatants, ammunition, arms, which\r\nmight cause interruption to traffic or convert line of transit into\r\ntheater hostilities.\"\r\n\r\nCASEY.\r\n\r\nWhen the Government in nominal control of the Isthmus continually\r\nbesought American interference to protect the \"rights\" it could not\r\nitself protect, and permitted our Government to transport Colombian\r\ntroops unarmed, under protection of our own armed men, while the\r\nColombian arms and ammunition came in a separate train, it is obvious\r\nthat the Colombian \"sovereignty\" was of such a character as to warrant\r\nour insisting that inasmuch as it only existed because of our protection\r\nthere should be in requital a sense of the obligations that the\r\nacceptance of this protection implied.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Colombia was under a dictatorship. In 1898 M. A. Sanclamente\r\nwas elected President, and J. M. Maroquin Vice-President, of the\r\nRepublic of Colombia. On July 31, 1900, the Vice-President, Maroquin,\r\nexecuted a \"coup d'etat\" by seizing the person of the President,\r\nSanclamente, and imprisoning him at a place a few miles out of Bogota.\r\nMaroquin thereupon declared himself possessed of the executive power\r\nbecause of \"the absence of the President\"--a delightful touch of\r\nunconscious humor. He then issued a decree that public order was\r\ndisturbed, and, upon that ground, assumed to himself legislative power\r\nunder another provision of the constitution; that is, having\r\nhimself disturbed the public order, he alleged the disturbance as a\r\njustification for seizing absolute power. Thenceforth Maroquin, without\r\nthe aid of any legislative body, ruled as a dictator, combining the\r\nsupreme executive, legislative, civil, and military authorities, in the\r\nso-called Republic of Colombia. The \"absence\" of Sanclamente from the\r\ncapital became permanent by his death in prison in the year 1902. When\r\nthe people of Panama declared their independence in November, 1903, no\r\nCongress had sat in Colombia since the year 1898, except the special\r\nCongress called by Maroquin to reject the canal treaty, and which did\r\nreject it by a unanimous vote, and adjourned without legislating on any\r\nother subject. The constitution of 1886 had taken away from Panama the\r\npower of self-government and vested it in Columbia. The _coup d'etat_\r\nof Maroquin took away from Colombia herself the power of government and\r\nvested it in an irresponsible dictator.\r\n\r\nConsideration of the above facts ought to be enough to show any human\r\nbeing that we were not dealing with normal conditions on the Isthmus\r\nand in Colombia. We were dealing with the government of an irresponsible\r\nalien dictator, and with a condition of affairs on the Isthmus\r\nitself which was marked by one uninterrupted series of outbreaks\r\nand revolutions. As for the \"consent of the governed\" theory, that\r\nabsolutely justified our action; the people on the Isthmus were the\r\n\"governed\"; they were governed by Colombia, without their consent, and\r\nthey unanimously repudiated the Colombian government, and demanded that\r\nthe United States build the canal.\r\n\r\nI had done everything possible, personally and through Secretary Hay,\r\nto persuade the Colombian Government to keep faith. Under the\r\nHay-Pauncefote Treaty, it was explicitly provided that the United States\r\nshould build the canal, should control, police and protect it, and keep\r\nit open to the vessels of all nations on equal terms. We had assumed the\r\nposition of guarantor of the canal, including, of course, the building\r\nof the canal, and of its peaceful use by all the world. The enterprise\r\nwas recognized everywhere as responding to an international need. It was\r\na mere travesty on justice to treat the government in possession of\r\nthe Isthmus as having the right--which Secretary Cass forty-five years\r\nbefore had so emphatically repudiated--to close the gates of intercourse\r\non one of the great highways of the world. When we submitted to Colombia\r\nthe Hay-Herran Treaty, it had been settled that the time for delay,\r\nthe time for permitting any government of anti-social character, or of\r\nimperfect development, to bar the work, had passed. The United States\r\nhad assumed in connection with the canal certain responsibilities not\r\nonly to its own people but to the civilized world, which imperatively\r\ndemanded that there should be no further delay in beginning the work.\r\nThe Hay-Herran Treaty, if it erred at all, erred in being overgenerous\r\ntoward Colombia. The people of Panama were delighted with the treaty,\r\nand the President of Colombia, who embodied in his own person the entire\r\ngovernment of Colombia, had authorized the treaty to be made. But after\r\nthe treaty had been made the Colombia Government thought it had the\r\nmatter in its own hands; and the further thought, equally wicked and\r\nfoolish, came into the heads of the people in control at Bogota that\r\nthey would seize the French Company at the end of another year and take\r\nfor themselves the forty million dollars which the United States had\r\nagreed to pay the Panama Canal Company.\r\n\r\nPresident Maroquin, through his Minister, had agreed to the\r\nHay-Herran Treaty in January, 1903. He had the absolute power of an\r\nunconstitutional dictator to keep his promise or break it. He determined\r\nto break it. To furnish himself an excuse for breaking it he devised\r\nthe plan of summoning a Congress especially called to reject the canal\r\ntreaty. This the Congress--a Congress of mere puppets--did, without a\r\ndissenting vote; and the puppets adjourned forthwith without legislating\r\non any other subject. The fact that this was a mere sham, and that the\r\nPresident had entire power to confirm his own treaty and act on it if he\r\ndesired, was shown as soon as the revolution took place, for on November\r\n6 General Reyes of Colombia addressed the American Minister at Bogota,\r\non behalf of President Maroquin, saying that \"if the Government of the\r\nUnited States would land troops and restore the Colombian sovereignty\"\r\nthe Colombian President would \"declare martial law; and, by virtue of\r\nvested constitutional authority, when public order is disturbed, would\r\napprove by decree the ratification of the canal treaty as signed; or, if\r\nthe Government of the United States prefers, would call an extra session\r\nof the Congress--with new and friendly members--next May to approve the\r\ntreaty.\" This, of course, is proof positive that the Colombian dictator\r\nhad used his Congress as a mere shield, and a sham shield at that, and\r\nit shows how utterly useless it would have been further to trust his\r\ngood faith in the matter.\r\n\r\nWhen, in August, 1903, I became convinced that Colombia intended to\r\nrepudiate the treaty made the preceding January, under cover of securing\r\nits rejection by the Colombian Legislature, I began carefully to\r\nconsider what should be done. By my direction, Secretary Hay, personally\r\nand through the Minister at Bogota, repeatedly warned Colombia that\r\ngrave consequences might follow her rejection of the treaty. The\r\npossibility of ratification did not wholly pass away until the close of\r\nthe session of the Colombian Congress on the last day of October. There\r\nwould then be two possibilities. One was that Panama would remain quiet.\r\nIn that case I was prepared to recommend to Congress that we should at\r\nonce occupy the Isthmus anyhow, and proceed to dig the canal; and I\r\nhad drawn out a draft of my message to this effect.[*] But from the\r\ninformation I received, I deemed it likely that there would be a\r\nrevolution in Panama as soon as the Colombian Congress adjourned without\r\nratifying the treaty, for the entire population of Panama felt that\r\nthe immediate building of the canal was of vital concern to their\r\nwell-being. Correspondents of the different newspapers on the Isthmus\r\nhad sent to their respective papers widely published forecasts\r\nindicating that there would be a revolution in such event.\r\n\r\n     [*] See appendix at end of this chapter.\r\n\r\nMoreover, on October 16, at the request of Lieutenant-General Young,\r\nCaptain Humphrey, and Lieutenant Murphy, two army officers who\r\nhad returned from the Isthmus, saw me and told me that there would\r\nunquestionably be a revolution on the Isthmus, that the people were\r\nunanimous in their criticism of the Bogota Government and their disgust\r\nover the failure of that Government to ratify the treaty; and that the\r\nrevolution would probably take place immediately after the adjournment\r\nof the Colombian Congress. They did not believe that it would be before\r\nOctober 20, but they were confident that it would certainly come at the\r\nend of October or immediately afterwards, when the Colombian Congress\r\nhad adjourned. Accordingly I directed the Navy Department to station\r\nvarious ships within easy reach of the Isthmus, to be ready to act in\r\nthe event of need arising.\r\n\r\nThese ships were barely in time. On November 3 the revolution occurred.\r\nPractically everybody on the Isthmus, including all the Colombian troops\r\nthat were already stationed there, joined in the revolution, and there\r\nwas no bloodshed. But on that same day four hundred new Colombian\r\ntroops were landed at Colon. Fortunately, the gunboat _Nashville_, under\r\nCommander Hubbard, reached Colon almost immediately afterwards, and when\r\nthe commander of the Colombian forces threatened the lives and property\r\nof the American citizens, including women and children, in Colon,\r\nCommander Hubbard landed a few score sailors and marines to protect\r\nthem. By a mixture of firmness and tact he not only prevented any\r\nassault on our citizens, but persuaded the Colombian commander to\r\nreembark his troops for Cartagena. On the Pacific side a Colombian\r\ngunboat shelled the City of Panama, with the result of killing one\r\nChinaman--the only life lost in the whole affair.\r\n\r\nNo one connected with the American Government had any part in preparing,\r\ninciting, or encouraging the revolution, and except for the reports of\r\nour military and naval officers, which I forwarded to Congress, no one\r\nconnected with the Government had any previous knowledge concerning the\r\nproposed revolution, except such as was accessible to any person who\r\nread the newspapers and kept abreast of current questions and current\r\naffairs. By the unanimous action of its people, and without the firing\r\nof a shot, the state of Panama declared themselves an independent\r\nrepublic. The time for hesitation on our part had passed.\r\n\r\nMy belief then was, and the events that have occurred since have more\r\nthan justified it, that from the standpoint of the United States it\r\nwas imperative, not only for civil but for military reasons, that there\r\nshould be the immediate establishment of easy and speedy communication\r\nby sea between the Atlantic and the Pacific. These reasons were not\r\nof convenience only, but of vital necessity, and did not admit of\r\nindefinite delay. The action of Colombia had shown not only that the\r\ndelay would be indefinite, but that she intended to confiscate the\r\nproperty and rights of the French Panama Canal Company. The report of\r\nthe Panama Canal Committee of the Colombian Senate on October 14,\r\n1903, on the proposed treaty with the United States, proposed that all\r\nconsideration of the matter should be postponed until October 31, 1904,\r\nwhen the next Colombian Congress would have convened, because by that\r\ntime the new Congress would be in condition to determine whether through\r\nlapse of time the French company had not forfeited its property and\r\nrights. \"When that time arrives,\" the report significantly declared,\r\n\"the Republic, without any impediment, will be able to contract and will\r\nbe in more clear, more definite and more advantageous possession, both\r\nlegally and materially.\" The naked meaning of this was that Colombia\r\nproposed to wait a year, and then enforce a forfeiture of the rights and\r\nproperty of the French Panama Company, so as to secure the forty million\r\ndollars our Government had authorized as payment to this company. If we\r\nhad sat supine, this would doubtless have meant that France would have\r\ninterfered to protect the company, and we should then have had on the\r\nIsthmus, not the company, but France; and the gravest international\r\ncomplications might have ensued. Every consideration of international\r\nmorality and expediency, of duty to the Panama people, and of\r\nsatisfaction of our own national interests and honor, bade us take\r\nimmediate action. I recognized Panama forthwith on behalf of the United\r\nStates, and practically all the countries of the world immediately\r\nfollowed suit. The State Department immediately negotiated a canal\r\ntreaty with the new Republic. One of the foremost men in securing the\r\nindependence of Panama, and the treaty which authorized the United\r\nStates forthwith to build the canal, was M. Philippe Bunau-Varilla, an\r\neminent French engineer formerly associated with De Lesseps and then\r\nliving on the Isthmus; his services to civilization were notable, and\r\ndeserve the fullest recognition.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning to the end our course was straightforward and in\r\nabsolute accord with the highest of standards of international morality.\r\nCriticism of it can come only from misinformation, or else from a\r\nsentimentality which represents both mental weakness and a moral twist.\r\nTo have acted otherwise than I did would have been on my part betrayal\r\nof the interests of the United States, indifference to the interests of\r\nPanama, and recreancy to the interests of the world at large. Colombia\r\nhad forfeited every claim to consideration; indeed, this is not stating\r\nthe case strongly enough: she had so acted that yielding to her would\r\nhave meant on our part that culpable form of weakness which stands on a\r\nlevel with wickedness. As for me personally, if I had hesitated to act,\r\nand had not in advance discounted the clamor of those Americans who have\r\nmade a fetish of disloyalty to their country, I should have esteemed\r\nmyself as deserving a place in Dante's inferno beside the faint-hearted\r\ncleric who was guilty of \"il gran rifiuto.\" The facts I have given\r\nabove are mere bald statements from the record. They show that from\r\nthe beginning there had been acceptance of our right to insist on free\r\ntransit, in whatever form was best, across the Isthmus; and that towards\r\nthe end there had been a no less universal feeling that it was our\r\nduty to the world to provide this transit in the shape of a canal--the\r\nresolution of the Pan-American Congress was practically a mandate\r\nto this effect. Colombia was then under a one-man government, a\r\ndictatorship, founded on usurpation of absolute and irresponsible power.\r\nShe eagerly pressed us to enter into an agreement with her, as long\r\nas there was any chance of our going to the alternative route through\r\nNicaragua. When she thought we were committed, she refused to fulfil the\r\nagreement, with the avowed hope of seizing the French company's property\r\nfor nothing and thereby holding us up. This was a bit of pure bandit\r\nmorality. It would have achieved its purpose had I possessed as weak\r\nmoral fiber as those of my critics who announced that I ought to\r\nhave confined my action to feeble scolding and temporizing until the\r\nopportunity for action passed. I did not lift my finger to incite the\r\nrevolutionists. The right simile to use is totally different. I simply\r\nceased to stamp out the different revolutionary fuses that were already\r\nburning. When Colombia committed flagrant wrong against us, I considered\r\nit no part of my duty to aid and abet her in her wrongdoing at our\r\nexpense, and also at the expense of Panama, of the French company,\r\nand of the world generally. There had been fifty years of continuous\r\nbloodshed and civil strife in Panama; because of my action Panama has\r\nnow known ten years of such peace and prosperity as she never before saw\r\nduring the four centuries of her existence--for in Panama, as in Cuba\r\nand Santo Domingo, it was the action of the American people, against the\r\noutcries of the professed apostles of peace, which alone brought peace.\r\nWe gave to the people of Panama self-government, and freed them from\r\nsubjection to alien oppressors. We did our best to get Colombia to let\r\nus treat her with a more than generous justice; we exercised patience\r\nto beyond the verge of proper forbearance. When we did act and recognize\r\nPanama, Colombia at once acknowledged her own guilt by promptly offering\r\nto do what we had demanded, and what she had protested it was not in her\r\npower to do. But the offer came too late. What we would gladly have done\r\nbefore, it had by that time become impossible for us honorably to do;\r\nfor it would have necessitated our abandoning the people of Panama, our\r\nfriends, and turning them over to their and our foes, who would have\r\nwreaked vengeance on them precisely because they had shown friendship to\r\nus. Colombia was solely responsible for her own humiliation; and she had\r\nnot then, and has not now, one shadow of claim upon us, moral or legal;\r\nall the wrong that was done was done by her. If, as representing the\r\nAmerican people, I had not acted precisely as I did, I would have been\r\nan unfaithful or incompetent representative; and inaction at that crisis\r\nwould have meant not only indefinite delay in building the canal, but\r\nalso practical admission on our part that we were not fit to play the\r\npart on the Isthmus which we had arrogated to ourselves. I acted on my\r\nown responsibility in the Panama matter. John Hay spoke of this action\r\nas follows: \"The action of the President in the Panama matter is not\r\nonly in the strictest accordance with the principles of justice and\r\nequity, and in line with all the best precedents of our public policy,\r\nbut it was the only course he could have taken in compliance with our\r\ntreaty rights and obligations.\"\r\n\r\nI deeply regretted, and now deeply regret, the fact that the Colombian\r\nGovernment rendered it imperative for me to take the action I took; but\r\nI had no alternative, consistent with the full performance of my duty\r\nto my own people, and to the nations of mankind. (For, be it remembered,\r\nthat certain other nations, Chile for example, will probably benefit\r\neven more by our action than will the United States itself.) I am well\r\naware that the Colombian people have many fine traits; that there is\r\namong them a circle of high-bred men and women which would reflect\r\nhonor on the social life of any country; and that there has been an\r\nintellectual and literary development within this small circle which\r\npartially atones for the stagnation and illiteracy of the mass of the\r\npeople; and I also know that even the illiterate mass possesses many\r\nsterling qualities. But unfortunately in international matters every\r\nnation must be judged by the action of its Government. The good people\r\nin Colombia apparently made no effort, certainly no successful effort,\r\nto cause the Government to act with reasonable good faith towards the\r\nUnited States; and Colombia had to take the consequences. If Brazil,\r\nor the Argentine, or Chile, had been in possession of the Isthmus,\r\ndoubtless the canal would have been built under the governmental control\r\nof the nation thus controlling the Isthmus, with the hearty acquiescence\r\nof the United States and of all other powers. But in the actual fact the\r\ncanal would not have been built at all save for the action I took. If\r\nmen choose to say that it would have been better not to build it, than\r\nto build it as the result of such action, their position, although\r\nfoolish, is compatible with belief in their wrongheaded sincerity. But\r\nit is hypocrisy, alike odious and contemptible, for any man to say both\r\nthat we ought to have built the canal and that we ought not to have\r\nacted in the way we did act.\r\n\r\nAfter a sufficient period of wrangling, the Senate ratified the treaty\r\nwith Panama, and work on the canal was begun. The first thing that\r\nwas necessary was to decide the type of canal. I summoned a board of\r\nengineering experts, foreign and native. They divided on their report.\r\nThe majority of the members, including all the foreign members, approved\r\na sea-level canal. The minority, including most of the American members,\r\napproved a lock canal. Studying these conclusions, I came to the belief\r\nthat the minority was right. The two great traffic canals of the world\r\nwere the Suez and the Soo. The Suez Canal is a sea-level canal, and it\r\nwas the one best known to European engineers. The Soo Canal, through\r\nwhich an even greater volume of traffic passes every year, is a lock\r\ncanal, and the American engineers were thoroughly familiar with it;\r\nwhereas, in my judgment, the European engineers had failed to pay proper\r\nheed to the lessons taught by its operation and management. Moreover,\r\nthe engineers who were to do the work at Panama all favored a lock\r\ncanal. I came to the conclusion that a sea-level canal would be slightly\r\nless exposed to damage in the event of war; that the running expenses,\r\napart from the heavy cost of interest on the amount necessary to build\r\nit, would be less; and that for small ships the time of transit would\r\nbe less. But I also came to the conclusion that the lock canal at the\r\nproposed level would cost only about half as much to build and would be\r\nbuilt in half the time, with much less risk; that for large ships the\r\ntransit would be quicker, and that, taking into account the interest\r\nsaved, the cost of maintenance would be less. Accordingly I recommended\r\nto Congress, on February 19, 1906, that a lock canal should be built,\r\nand my recommendation was adopted. Congress insisted upon having it\r\nbuilt by a commission of several men. I tried faithfully to get good\r\nwork out of the commission, and found it quite impossible; for a\r\nmany-headed commission is an extremely poor executive instrument. At\r\nlast I put Colonel Goethals in as head of the commission. Then, when\r\nCongress still refused to make the commission single-headed, I\r\nsolved the difficulty by an executive order of January 6, 1908, which\r\npractically accomplished the object by enlarging the powers of the\r\nchairman, making all the other members of the commission dependent upon\r\nhim, and thereby placing the work under one-man control. Dr. Gorgas\r\nhad already performed an inestimable service by caring for the sanitary\r\nconditions so thoroughly as to make the Isthmus as safe as a health\r\nresort. Colonel Goethals proved to be the man of all others to do the\r\njob. It would be impossible to overstate what he has done. It is the\r\ngreatest task of any kind that any man in the world has accomplished\r\nduring the years that Colonel Goethals has been at work. It is the\r\ngreatest task of its own kind that has ever been performed in the world\r\nat all. Colonel Goethals has succeeded in instilling into the men under\r\nhim a spirit which elsewhere has been found only in a few victorious\r\narmies. It is proper and appropriate that, like the soldiers of such\r\narmies, they should receive medals which are allotted each man who has\r\nserved for a sufficient length of time. A finer body of men has never\r\nbeen gathered by any nation than the men who have done the work of\r\nbuilding the Panama Canal; the conditions under which they have lived\r\nand have done their work have been better than in any similar work ever\r\nundertaken in the tropics; they have all felt an eager pride in their\r\nwork; and they have made not only America but the whole world their\r\ndebtors by what they have accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nCOLOMBIA: THE PROPOSED MESSAGE TO CONGRESS\r\n\r\nThe rough draft of the message I had proposed to send Congress ran as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"The Colombian Government, through its representative here, and directly\r\nin communication with our representative at Colombia, has refused to\r\ncome to any agreement with us, and has delayed action so as to make it\r\nevident that it intends to make extortionate and improper terms with us.\r\nThe Isthmian Canal bill was, of course, passed upon the assumption that\r\nwhatever route was used, the benefit to the particular section of the\r\nIsthmus through which it passed would be so great that the country\r\ncontrolling this part would be eager to facilitate the building of the\r\ncanal. It is out of the question to submit to extortion on the part of a\r\nbeneficiary of the scheme. All the labor, all the expense, all the risk\r\nare to be assumed by us and all the skill shown by us. Those controlling\r\nthe ground through which the canal is to be put are wholly incapable of\r\nbuilding it.\r\n\r\n\"Yet the interest of international commerce generally and the interest\r\nof this country generally demands that the canal should be begun with\r\nno needless delay. The refusal of Colombia properly to respond to our\r\nsincere and earnest efforts to come to an agreement, or to pay heed to\r\nthe many concessions we have made, renders it in my judgment necessary\r\nthat the United States should take immediate action on one of two lines:\r\neither we should drop the Panama canal project and immediately begin\r\nwork on the Nicaraguan canal, or else we should purchase all the rights\r\nof the French company, and, without any further parley with Colombia,\r\nenter upon the completion of the canal which the French company\r\nhas begun. I feel that the latter course is the one demanded by the\r\ninterests of this Nation, and I therefore bring the matter to your\r\nattention for such action in the premises as you may deem wise. If in\r\nyour judgment it is better not to take such action, then I shall proceed\r\nat once with the Nicaraguan canal.\r\n\r\n\"The reason that I advocate the action above outlined in regard to the\r\nPanama canal is, in the first place, the strong testimony of the\r\nexperts that this route is the most feasible; and in the next place, the\r\nimpropriety from an international standpoint of permitting such conduct\r\nas that to which Colombia seems to incline. The testimony of the experts\r\nis very strong, not only that the Panama route is feasible, but that in\r\nthe Nicaragua route we may encounter some unpleasant surprises, and that\r\nit is far more difficult to forecast the result with any certainty\r\nas regards this latter route. As for Colombia's attitude, it is\r\nincomprehensible upon any theory of desire to see the canal built upon\r\nthe basis of mutual advantage alike to those building it and to Colombia\r\nherself. All we desire to do is to take up the work begun by the French\r\nGovernment and to finish it. Obviously it is Colombia's duty to help\r\ntowards such completion. We are most anxious to come to an agreement\r\nwith her in which most scrupulous care should be taken to guard her\r\ninterests and ours. But we cannot consent to permit her to block\r\nthe performance of the work which it is so greatly to our interest\r\nimmediately to begin and carry through.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after this rough draft was dictated the Panama revolution came,\r\nand I never thought of the rough draft again until I was accused of\r\nhaving instigated the revolution. This accusation is preposterous in\r\nthe eyes of any one who knows the actual conditions at Panama. Only the\r\nmenace of action by us in the interest of Colombia kept down revolution;\r\nas soon as Colombia's own conduct removed such menace, all check on the\r\nvarious revolutionary movements (there were at least three from entirely\r\nseparate sources) ceased; and then an explosion was inevitable, for\r\nthe French company knew that all their property would be confiscated\r\nif Colombia put through her plans, and the entire people of Panama felt\r\nthat if in disgust with Colombia's extortions the United States turned\r\nto Nicaragua, they, the people of Panama, would be ruined. Knowing the\r\ncharacter of those then in charge of the Colombian Government, I was not\r\nsurprised at their bad faith; but I was surprised at their folly. They\r\napparently had no idea either of the power of France or the power of\r\nthe United States, and expected to be permitted to commit wrong with\r\nimpunity, just as Castro in Venezuela had done. The difference was that,\r\nunless we acted in self-defense, Colombia had it in her power to do\r\nus serious harm, and Venezuela did not have such power. Colombia's\r\nwrongdoing, therefore, recoiled on her own head. There was no new\r\nlesson taught; it ought already to have been known to every one that\r\nwickedness, weakness, and folly combined rarely fail to meet punishment,\r\nand that the intent to do wrong, when joined to inability to carry\r\nthe evil purpose to a successful conclusion, inevitably reacts on the\r\nwrongdoer.\r\n\r\nFor the full history of the acquisition and building of the canal see\r\n\"The Panama Gateway,\" by Joseph Bucklin Bishop (Scribner's Sons). Mr.\r\nBishop has been for eight years secretary of the commission and is one\r\nof the most efficient of the many efficient men to whose work on the\r\nIsthmus America owes so much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE PEACE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS\r\n\r\nThere can be no nobler cause for which to work than the peace of\r\nrighteousness; and high honor is due those serene and lofty souls who\r\nwith wisdom and courage, with high idealism tempered by sane facing\r\nof the actual facts of life, have striven to bring nearer the day when\r\narmed strife between nation and nation, between class and class, between\r\nman and man shall end throughout the world. Because all this is true, it\r\nis also true that there are no men more ignoble or more foolish, no men\r\nwhose actions are fraught with greater possibility of mischief to their\r\ncountry and to mankind, than those who exalt unrighteous peace as better\r\nthan righteous war. The men who have stood highest in our history, as in\r\nthe history of all countries, are those who scorned injustice, who were\r\nincapable of oppressing the weak, or of permitting their country, with\r\ntheir consent, to oppress the weak, but who did not hesitate to draw\r\nthe sword when to leave it undrawn meant inability to arrest triumphant\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nAll this is so obvious that it ought not to be necessary to repeat it.\r\nYet every man in active affairs, who also reads about the past, grows\r\nby bitter experience to realize that there are plenty of men, not only\r\namong those who mean ill, but among those who mean well, who are ready\r\nenough to praise what was done in the past, and yet are incapable of\r\nprofiting by it when faced by the needs of the present. During our\r\ngeneration this seems to have been peculiarly the case among the men who\r\nhave become obsessed with the idea of obtaining universal peace by some\r\ncheap patent panacea.\r\n\r\nThere has been a real and substantial growth in the feeling for\r\ninternational responsibility and justice among the great civilized\r\nnations during the past threescore or fourscore years. There has been a\r\nreal growth of recognition of the fact that moral turpitude is involved\r\nin the wronging of one nation by another, and that in most cases war is\r\nan evil method of settling international difficulties. But as yet\r\nthere has been only a rudimentary beginning of the development of\r\ninternational tribunals of justice, and there has been no development at\r\nall of any international police power. Now, as I have already said,\r\nthe whole fabric of municipal law, of law within each nation, rests\r\nultimately upon the judge and the policeman; and the complete absence\r\nof the policeman, and the almost complete absence of the judge, in\r\ninternational affairs, prevents there being as yet any real homology\r\nbetween municipal and international law.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the questions which sometimes involve nations in war are\r\nfar more difficult and complex than any questions that affect merely\r\nindividuals. Almost every great nation has inherited certain questions,\r\neither with other nations or with sections of its own people, which it\r\nis quite impossible, in the present state of civilization, to decide\r\nas matters between private individuals can be decided. During the last\r\ncentury at least half of the wars that have been fought have been\r\ncivil and not foreign wars. There are big and powerful nations which\r\nhabitually commit, either upon other nations or upon sections of their\r\nown people, wrongs so outrageous as to justify even the most peaceful\r\npersons in going to war. There are also weak nations so utterly\r\nincompetent either to protect the rights of foreigners against their own\r\ncitizens, or to protect their own citizens against foreigners, that it\r\nbecomes a matter of sheer duty for some outside power to interfere in\r\nconnection with them. As yet in neither case is there any efficient\r\nmethod of getting international action; and if joint action by several\r\npowers is secured, the result is usually considerably worse than if only\r\none Power interfered. The worst infamies of modern times--such affairs\r\nas the massacres of the Armenians by the Turks, for instance--have been\r\nperpetrated in a time of nominally profound international peace, when\r\nthere has been a concert of big Powers to prevent the breaking of this\r\npeace, although only by breaking it could the outrages be stopped. Be it\r\nremembered that the peoples who suffered by these hideous massacres,\r\nwho saw their women violated and their children tortured, were actually\r\nenjoying all the benefits of \"disarmament.\" Otherwise they would not\r\nhave been massacred; for if the Jews in Russia and the Armenians in\r\nTurkey had been armed, and had been efficient in the use of their arms,\r\nno mob would have meddled with them.\r\n\r\nYet amiable but fatuous persons, with all these facts before their eyes,\r\npass resolutions demanding universal arbitration for everything, and the\r\ndisarmament of the free civilized powers and their abandonment of their\r\narmed forces; or else they write well-meaning, solemn little books, or\r\npamphlets or editorials, and articles in magazines or newspapers, to\r\nshow that it is \"an illusion\" to believe that war ever pays, because it\r\nis expensive. This is precisely like arguing that we should disband the\r\npolice and devote our sole attention to persuading criminals that it\r\nis \"an illusion\" to suppose that burglary, highway robbery and white\r\nslavery are profitable. It is almost useless to attempt to argue with\r\nthese well-intentioned persons, because they are suffering under an\r\nobsession and are not open to reason. They go wrong at the outset, for\r\nthey lay all the emphasis on peace and none at all on righteousness.\r\nThey are not all of them physically timid men; but they are usually men\r\nof soft life; and they rarely possess a high sense of honor or a keen\r\npatriotism. They rarely try to prevent their fellow countrymen from\r\ninsulting or wronging the people of other nations; but they always\r\nardently advocate that we, in our turn, shall tamely submit to wrong\r\nand insult from other nations. As Americans their folly is peculiarly\r\nscandalous, because if the principles they now uphold are right, it\r\nmeans that it would have been better that Americans should never have\r\nachieved their independence, and better that, in 1861, they should have\r\npeacefully submitted to seeing their country split into half a dozen\r\njangling confederacies and slavery made perpetual. If unwilling to learn\r\nfrom their own history, let those who think that it is an \"illusion\" to\r\nbelieve that a war ever benefits a nation look at the difference between\r\nChina and Japan. China has neither a fleet nor an efficient army. It is\r\na huge civilized empire, one of the most populous on the globe; and it\r\nhas been the helpless prey of outsiders because it does not possess the\r\npower to fight. Japan stands on a footing of equality with European\r\nand American nations because it does possess this power. China now sees\r\nJapan, Russia, Germany, England and France in possession of fragments of\r\nher empire, and has twice within the lifetime of the present generation\r\nseen her capital in the hands of allied invaders, because she in very\r\nfact realizes the ideals of the persons who wish the United States\r\nto disarm, and then trust that our helplessness will secure us a\r\ncontemptuous immunity from attack by outside nations.\r\n\r\nThe chief trouble comes from the entire inability of these worthy\r\npeople to understand that they are demanding things that are mutually\r\nincompatible when they demand peace at any price, and also justice and\r\nrighteousness. I remember one representative of their number, who used\r\nto write little sonnets on behalf of the Mahdi and the Sudanese, these\r\nsonnets setting forth the need that the Sudan should be both independent\r\nand peaceful. As a matter of fact, the Sudan valued independence only\r\nbecause it desired to war against all Christians and to carry on an\r\nunlimited slave trade. It was \"independent\" under the Mahdi for a dozen\r\nyears, and during those dozen years the bigotry, tyranny, and cruel\r\nreligious intolerance were such as flourished in the seventh century,\r\nand in spite of systematic slave raids the population decreased by\r\nnearly two-thirds, and practically all the children died. Peace came,\r\nwell-being came, freedom from rape and murder and torture and highway\r\nrobbery, and every brutal gratification of lust and greed came, only\r\nwhen the Sudan lost its independence and passed under English rule. Yet\r\nthis well-meaning little sonneteer sincerely felt that his verses were\r\nissued in the cause of humanity. Looking back from the vantage point of\r\na score of years, probably every one will agree that he was an absurd\r\nperson. But he was not one whit more absurd than most of the more\r\nprominent persons who advocate disarmament by the United States, the\r\ncessation of up-building the navy, and the promise to agree to arbitrate\r\nall matters, including those affecting our national interests and honor,\r\nwith all foreign nations.\r\n\r\nThese persons would do no harm if they affected only themselves. Many\r\nof them are, in the ordinary relations of life, good citizens. They are\r\nexactly like the other good citizens who believe that enforced universal\r\nvegetarianism or anti-vaccination is the panacea for all ills. But in\r\ntheir particular case they are able to do harm because they affect our\r\nrelations with foreign powers, so that other men pay the debt which they\r\nthemselves have really incurred. It is the foolish, peace-at-any-price\r\npersons who try to persuade our people to make unwise and improper\r\ntreaties, or to stop building up the navy. But if trouble comes and the\r\ntreaties are repudiated, or there is a demand for armed intervention,\r\nit is not these people who will pay anything; they will stay at home in\r\nsafety, and leave brave men to pay in blood, and honest men to pay in\r\nshame, for their folly.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is that our policy is apt to go in zigzags, because\r\ndifferent sections of our people exercise at different times unequal\r\npressure on our government. One class of our citizens clamors for\r\ntreaties impossible of fulfilment, and improper to fulfil; another class\r\nhas no objection to the passage of these treaties so long as there is no\r\nconcrete case to which they apply, but instantly oppose a veto on their\r\napplication when any concrete case does actually arise. One of our\r\ncardinal doctrines is freedom of speech, which means freedom of speech\r\nabout foreigners as well as about ourselves; and, inasmuch as we\r\nexercise this right with complete absence of restraint, we cannot expect\r\nother nations to hold us harmless unless in the last resort we are\r\nable to make our own words good by our deeds. One class of our citizens\r\nindulges in gushing promises to do everything for foreigners, another\r\nclass offensively and improperly reviles them; and it is hard to say\r\nwhich class more thoroughly misrepresents the sober, self-respecting\r\njudgment of the American people as a whole. The only safe rule is to\r\npromise little, and faithfully to keep every promise; to \"speak softly\r\nand carry a big stick.\"\r\n\r\nA prime need for our nation, as of course for every other nation, is\r\nto make up its mind definitely what it wishes, and not to try to pursue\r\npaths of conduct incompatible one with the other. If this nation is\r\ncontent to be the China of the New World, then and then only can it\r\nafford to do away with the navy and the army. If it is content to\r\nabandon Hawaii and the Panama Canal, to cease to talk of the Monroe\r\nDoctrine, and to admit the right of any European or Asiatic power to\r\ndictate what immigrants shall be sent to and received in America,\r\nand whether or not they shall be allowed to become citizens and hold\r\nland--why, of course, if America is content to have nothing to say\r\non any of these matters and to keep silent in the presence of armed\r\noutsiders, then it can abandon its navy and agree to arbitrate all\r\nquestions of all kinds with every foreign power. In such event it can\r\nafford to pass its spare time in one continuous round of universal\r\npeace celebrations, and of smug self-satisfaction in having earned the\r\nderision of all the virile peoples of mankind. Those who advocate such\r\na policy do not occupy a lofty position. But at least their position is\r\nunderstandable.\r\n\r\nIt is entirely inexcusable, however, to try to combine the unready hand\r\nwith the unbridled tongue. It is folly to permit freedom of speech about\r\nforeigners as well as ourselves--and the peace-at-any-price persons are\r\nmuch too feeble a folk to try to interfere with freedom of speech--and\r\nyet to try to shirk the consequences of freedom of speech. It is folly\r\nto try to abolish our navy, and at the same time to insist that we have\r\na right to enforce the Monroe Doctrine, that we have a right to control\r\nthe Panama Canal which we ourselves dug, that we have a right to retain\r\nHawaii and prevent foreign nations from taking Cuba, and a right to\r\ndetermine what immigrants, Asiatic or European, shall come to our\r\nshores, and the terms on which they shall be naturalized and shall\r\nhold land and exercise other privileges. We are a rich people, and\r\nan unmilitary people. In international affairs we are a short-sighted\r\npeople. But I know my countrymen. Down at bottom their temper is such\r\nthat they will not permanently tolerate injustice done to them. In the\r\nlong run they will no more permit affronts to their National honor than\r\ninjuries to their national interest. Such being the case, they will do\r\nwell to remember that the surest of all ways to invite disaster is to be\r\nopulent, aggressive and unarmed.\r\n\r\nThroughout the seven and a half years that I was President, I pursued\r\nwithout faltering one consistent foreign policy, a policy of genuine\r\ninternational good will and of consideration for the rights of others,\r\nand at the same time of steady preparedness. The weakest nations knew\r\nthat they, no less than the strongest, were safe from insult and injury\r\nat our hands; and the strong and the weak alike also knew that we\r\npossessed both the will and the ability to guard ourselves from wrong or\r\ninsult at the hands of any one.\r\n\r\nIt was under my administration that the Hague Court was saved from\r\nbecoming an empty farce. It had been established by joint international\r\nagreement, but no Power had been willing to resort to it. Those\r\nestablishing it had grown to realize that it was in danger of becoming a\r\nmere paper court, so that it would never really come into being at all.\r\nM. d'Estournelles de Constant had been especially alive to this danger.\r\nBy correspondence and in personal interviews he impressed upon me the\r\nneed not only of making advances by actually applying arbitration--not\r\nmerely promising by treaty to apply it--to questions that were up\r\nfor settlement, but of using the Hague tribunal for this purpose. I\r\ncordially sympathized with these views. On the recommendation of John\r\nHay, I succeeded in getting an agreement with Mexico to lay a matter in\r\ndispute between the two republics before the Hague Court. This was\r\nthe first case ever brought before the Hague Court. It was followed by\r\nnumerous others; and it definitely established that court as the great\r\ninternational peace tribunal. By mutual agreement with Great Britain,\r\nthrough the decision of a joint commission, of which the American\r\nmembers were Senators Lodge and Turner, and Secretary Root, we were able\r\npeacefully to settle the Alaska Boundary question, the only question\r\nremaining between ourselves and the British Empire which it was not\r\npossible to settle by friendly arbitration; this therefore represented\r\nthe removal of the last obstacle to absolute agreement between the two\r\npeoples. We were of substantial service in bringing to a satisfactory\r\nconclusion the negotiations at Algeciras concerning Morocco. We\r\nconcluded with Great Britain, and with most of the other great nations,\r\narbitration treaties specifically agreeing to arbitrate all matters,\r\nand especially the interpretation of treaties, save only as regards\r\nquestions affecting territorial integrity, national honor and vital\r\nnational interest. We made with Great Britain a treaty guaranteeing the\r\nfree use of the Panama Canal on equal terms to the ships of all nations,\r\nwhile reserving to ourselves the right to police and fortify the canal,\r\nand therefore to control it in time of war. Under this treaty we are\r\nin honor bound to arbitrate the question of canal tolls for coastwise\r\ntraffic between the Western and Eastern coasts of the United States. I\r\nbelieve that the American position as regards this matter is right; but\r\nI also believe that under the arbitration treaty we are in honor\r\nbound to submit the matter to arbitration in view of Great Britain's\r\ncontention--although I hold it to be an unwise contention--that our\r\nposition is unsound. I emphatically disbelieve in making universal\r\narbitration treaties which neither the makers nor any one else would for\r\na moment dream of keeping. I no less emphatically insist that it is our\r\nduty to keep the limited and sensible arbitration treaties which we have\r\nalready made. The importance of a promise lies not in making it, but in\r\nkeeping it; and the poorest of all positions for a nation to occupy in\r\nsuch a matter is readiness to make impossible promises at the same time\r\nthat there is failure to keep promises which have been made, which can\r\nbe kept, and which it is discreditable to break.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the year 1905, the strain on the civilized\r\nworld caused by the Russo-Japanese War became serious. The losses of\r\nlife and of treasure were frightful. From all the sources of information\r\nat hand, I grew most strongly to believe that a further continuation\r\nof the struggle would be a very bad thing for Japan, and an even worse\r\nthing for Russia. Japan was already suffering terribly from the drain\r\nupon her men, and especially upon her resources, and had nothing further\r\nto gain from continuance of the struggle; its continuance meant to her\r\nmore loss than gain, even if she were victorious. Russia, in spite of\r\nher gigantic strength, was, in my judgment, apt to lose even more than\r\nshe had already lost if the struggle continued. I deemed it probable\r\nthat she would no more be able successfully to defend Eastern Siberia\r\nand Northern Manchuria than she had been able to defend Southern\r\nManchuria and Korea. If the war went on, I thought it, on the whole,\r\nlikely that Russia would be driven west of Lake Baikal. But it was very\r\nfar from certain. There is no certainty in such a war. Japan might have\r\nmet defeat, and defeat to her would have spelt overwhelming disaster;\r\nand even if she had continued to win, what she thus won would have been\r\nof no value to her, and the cost in blood and money would have left her\r\ndrained white. I believed, therefore, that the time had come when it\r\nwas greatly to the interest of both combatants to have peace, and when\r\ntherefore it was possible to get both to agree to peace.\r\n\r\nI first satisfied myself that each side wished me to act, but that,\r\nnaturally and properly, each side was exceedingly anxious that the other\r\nshould not believe that the action was taken on its initiative. I then\r\nsent an identical note to the two powers proposing that they should\r\nmeet, through their representatives, to see if peace could not be made\r\ndirectly between them, and offered to act as an intermediary in bringing\r\nabout such a meeting, but not for any other purpose. Each assented to my\r\nproposal in principle. There was difficulty in getting them to agree\r\non a common meeting place; but each finally abandoned its original\r\ncontention in the matter, and the representatives of the two nations\r\nfinally met at Portsmouth, in New Hampshire. I previously received the\r\ntwo delegations at Oyster Bay on the U. S. S. Mayflower, which, together\r\nwith another naval vessel, I put at their disposal, on behalf of the\r\nUnited States Government, to take them from Oyster Bay to Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nAs is customary--but both unwise and undesirable--in such cases,\r\neach side advanced claims which the other could not grant. The chief\r\ndifficulty came because of Japan's demand for a money indemnity. I felt\r\nthat it would be better for Russia to pay some indemnity than to go on\r\nwith the war, for there was little chance, in my judgment, of the war\r\nturning out favorably for Russia, and the revolutionary movement already\r\nunder way bade fair to overthrow the negotiations entirely. I advised\r\nthe Russian Government to this effect, at the same time urging them to\r\nabandon their pretensions on certain other points, notably concerning\r\nthe southern half of Saghalien, which the Japanese had taken. I also,\r\nhowever, and equally strongly, advised the Japanese that in my judgment\r\nit would be the gravest mistake on their part to insist on continuing\r\nthe war for the sake of a money indemnity; for Russia was absolutely\r\nfirm in refusing to give them an indemnity, and the longer the war\r\ncontinued the less able she would be to pay. I pointed out that there\r\nwas no possible analogy between their case and that of Germany in the\r\nwar with France, which they were fond of quoting. The Germans held Paris\r\nand half of France, and gave up much territory in lieu of the indemnity,\r\nwhereas the Japanese were still many thousand miles from Moscow, and had\r\nno territory whatever which they wished to give up. I also pointed out\r\nthat in my judgment whereas the Japanese had enjoyed the sympathy of\r\nmost of the civilized powers at the outset of and during the continuance\r\nof the war, they would forfeit it if they turned the war into one merely\r\nfor getting money--and, moreover, they would almost certainly fail to\r\nget the money, and would simply find themselves at the end of a year,\r\neven if things prospered with them, in possession of territory they\r\ndid not want, having spent enormous additional sums of money, and\r\nlost enormous additional numbers of men, and yet without a penny of\r\nremuneration. The treaty of peace was finally signed.\r\n\r\nAs is inevitable under such circumstances, each side felt that it ought\r\nto have got better terms; and when the danger was well past each side\r\nfelt that it had been over-reached by the other, and that if the war had\r\ngone on it would have gotten more than it actually did get. The Japanese\r\nGovernment had been wise throughout, except in the matter of announcing\r\nthat it would insist on a money indemnity. Neither in national nor in\r\nprivate affairs is it ordinarily advisable to make a bluff which cannot\r\nbe put through--personally, I never believe in doing it under any\r\ncircumstances. The Japanese people had been misled by this bluff of\r\ntheir Government; and the unwisdom of the Government's action in the\r\nmatter was shown by the great resentment the treaty aroused in\r\nJapan, although it was so beneficial to Japan. There were various mob\r\noutbreaks, especially in the Japanese cities; the police were roughly\r\nhandled, and several Christian churches were burned, as reported to me\r\nby the American Minister. In both Russia and Japan I believe that the\r\nnet result as regards myself was a feeling of injury, and of dislike\r\nof me, among the people at large. I had expected this; I regarded it as\r\nentirely natural; and I did not resent it in the least. The Governments\r\nof both nations behaved toward me not only with correct and entire\r\npropriety, but with much courtesy and the fullest acknowledgment of the\r\ngood effect of what I had done; and in Japan, at least, I believe that\r\nthe leading men sincerely felt that I had been their friend. I had\r\ncertainly tried my best to be the friend not only of the Japanese people\r\nbut of the Russian people, and I believe that what I did was for the\r\nbest interests of both and of the world at large.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the negotiations I tried to enlist the aid of the\r\nGovernments of one nation which was friendly to Russia, and of another\r\nnation which was friendly to Japan, in helping bring about peace. I\r\ngot no aid from either. I did, however, receive aid from the Emperor\r\nof Germany. His Ambassador at St. Petersburg was the one Ambassador\r\nwho helped the American Ambassador, Mr. Meyer, at delicate and doubtful\r\npoints of the negotiations. Mr. Meyer, who was, with the exception of\r\nMr. White, the most useful diplomat in the American service, rendered\r\nliterally invaluable aid by insisting upon himself seeing the Czar at\r\ncritical periods of the transaction, when it was no longer possible for\r\nme to act successfully through the representatives of the Czar, who were\r\noften at cross purposes with one another.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the Portsmouth peace, I was given the Nobel Peace Prize.\r\nThis consisted of a medal, which I kept, and a sum of $40,000, which I\r\nturned over as a foundation of industrial peace to a board of trustees\r\nwhich included Oscar Straus, Seth Low and John Mitchell. In the present\r\nstate of the world's development industrial peace is even more essential\r\nthan international peace; and it was fitting and appropriate to devote\r\nthe peace prize to such a purpose. In 1910, while in Europe, one of my\r\nmost pleasant experiences was my visit to Norway, where I addressed the\r\nNobel Committee, and set forth in full the principles upon which I\r\nhad acted, not only in this particular case but throughout my\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nI received another gift which I deeply appreciated, an original copy\r\nof Sully's \"Memoires\" of \"Henry le Grand,\" sent me with the following\r\ninscription (I translate it roughly):\r\n\r\nPARIS, January, 1906.\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned members of the French Parliamentary Group of\r\nInternational Arbitration and Conciliation have decided to tender\r\nPresident Roosevelt a token of their high esteem and their sympathetic\r\nrecognition of the persistent and decisive initiative he has taken\r\ntowards gradually substituting friendly and judicial for violent methods\r\nin case of conflict between Nations.\r\n\r\n\"They believe that the action of President Roosevelt, which has realized\r\nthe most generous hopes to be found in history, should be classed as a\r\ncontinuance of similar illustrious attempts of former times, notably\r\nthe project for international concord known under the name of the 'Great\r\nDesign of Henry IV' in the memoirs of his Prime Minister, the Duke de\r\nSully. In consequence they have sought out a copy of the first edition\r\nof these memoirs, and they take pleasure in offering it to him, with the\r\nrequest that he will keep it among his family papers.\"\r\n\r\nThe signatures include those of Emile Loubet, A. Carnot, d'Estournelles\r\nde Constant, Aristide Briand, Sully Prudhomme, Jean Jaures, A.\r\nFallieres, R. Poincare, and two or three hundred others.\r\n\r\nOf course what I had done in connection with the Portsmouth peace\r\nwas misunderstood by some good and sincere people. Just as after the\r\nsettlement of the coal strike, there were persons who thereupon thought\r\nthat it was in my power, and was my duty, to settle all other strikes,\r\nso after the peace of Portsmouth there were other persons--not only\r\nAmericans, by the way,--who thought it my duty forthwith to make myself\r\na kind of international Meddlesome Mattie and interfere for peace\r\nand justice promiscuously over the world. Others, with a delightful\r\nnon-sequitur, jumped to the conclusion that inasmuch as I had helped to\r\nbring about a beneficent and necessary peace I must of necessity have\r\nchanged my mind about war being ever necessary. A couple of days after\r\npeace was concluded I wrote to a friend: \"Don't you be misled by the\r\nfact that just at the moment men are speaking well of me. They will\r\nspeak ill soon enough. As Loeb remarked to me to-day, some time soon I\r\nshall have to spank some little international brigand, and then all the\r\nwell-meaning idiots will turn and shriek that this is inconsistent\r\nwith what I did at the Peace Conference, whereas in reality it will be\r\nexactly in line with it.\"\r\n\r\nTo one of my political opponents, Mr. Schurz, who wrote me\r\ncongratulating me upon the outcome at Portsmouth, and suggesting that\r\nthe time was opportune for a move towards disarmament, I answered in a\r\nletter setting forth views which I thought sound then, and think sound\r\nnow. The letter ran as follows:\r\n\r\nOYSTER BAY, N. Y., September 8, 1905.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Schurz: I thank you for your congratulations. As to what you\r\nsay about disarmament--which I suppose is the rough equivalent of \"the\r\ngradual diminution of the oppressive burdens imposed upon the world by\r\narmed peace\"--I am not clear either as to what can be done or what ought\r\nto be done. If I had been known as one of the conventional type of peace\r\nadvocates I could have done nothing whatever in bringing about peace\r\nnow, I would be powerless in the future to accomplish anything, and\r\nI would not have been able to help confer the boons upon Cuba, the\r\nPhilippines, Porto Rico and Panama, brought about by our action therein.\r\nIf the Japanese had not armed during the last twenty years, this would\r\nindeed be a sorrowful century for Japan. If this country had not fought\r\nthe Spanish War; if we had failed to take the action we did about\r\nPanama; all mankind would have been the loser. While the Turks were\r\nbutchering the Armenians the European powers kept the peace and thereby\r\nadded a burden of infamy to the Nineteenth Century, for in keeping that\r\npeace a greater number of lives were lost than in any European war since\r\nthe days of Napoleon, and these lives were those of women and children\r\nas well as of men; while the moral degradation, the brutality inflicted\r\nand endured, the aggregate of hideous wrong done, surpassed that of any\r\nwar of which we have record in modern times. Until people get it firmly\r\nfixed in their minds that peace is valuable chiefly as a means to\r\nrighteousness, and that it can only be considered as an end when it also\r\ncoincides with righteousness, we can do only a limited amount to advance\r\nits coming on this earth. There is of course no analogy at present\r\nbetween international law and private or municipal law, because there\r\nis no sanction of force for the former, while there is for the latter.\r\nInside our own nation the law-abiding man does not have to arm himself\r\nagainst the lawless simply because there is some armed force--the\r\npolice, the sheriff's posse, the national guard, the regulars--which\r\ncan be called out to enforce the laws. At present there is no similar\r\ninternational force to call on, and I do not as yet see how it could\r\nat present be created. Hitherto peace has often come only because some\r\nstrong and on the whole just power has by armed force, or the threat of\r\narmed force, put a stop to disorder. In a very interesting French book\r\nthe other day I was reading how the Mediterranean was freed from pirates\r\nonly by the \"pax Britannica,\" established by England's naval force. The\r\nhopeless and hideous bloodshed and wickedness of Algiers and Turkestan\r\nwas stopped, and could only be stopped, when civilized nations in the\r\nshape of Russia and France took possession of them. The same was true\r\nof Burma and the Malay States, as well as Egypt, with regard to England.\r\nPeace has come only as the sequel to the armed interference of a\r\ncivilized power which, relatively to its opponent, was a just and\r\nbeneficent power. If England had disarmed to the point of being unable\r\nto conquer the Sudan and protect Egypt, so that the Mahdists had\r\nestablished their supremacy in northeastern Africa, the result would\r\nhave been a horrible and bloody calamity to mankind. It was only the\r\ngrowth of the European powers in military efficiency that freed eastern\r\nEurope from the dreadful scourge of the Tartar and partially freed it\r\nfrom the dreadful scourge of the Turk. Unjust war is dreadful; a just\r\nwar may be the highest duty. To have the best nations, the free and\r\ncivilized nations, disarm and leave the despotisms and barbarisms\r\nwith great military force, would be a calamity compared to which the\r\ncalamities caused by all the wars of the nineteenth century would be\r\ntrivial. Yet it is not easy to see how we can by international agreement\r\nstate exactly which power ceases to be free and civilized and which\r\ncomes near the line of barbarism or despotism. For example, I suppose\r\nit would be very difficult to get Russia and Japan to come to a common\r\nagreement on this point; and there are at least some citizens of other\r\nnations, not to speak of their governments, whom it would also be hard\r\nto get together.\r\n\r\nThis does not in the least mean that it is hopeless to make the effort.\r\nIt may be that some scheme will be developed. America, fortunately,\r\ncan cordially assist in such an effort, for no one in his senses would\r\nsuggest our disarmament; and though we should continue to perfect our\r\nsmall navy and our minute army, I do not think it necessary to increase\r\nthe number of our ships--at any rate as things look now--nor the number\r\nof our soldiers. Of course our navy must be kept up to the highest\r\npoint of efficiency, and the replacing of old and worthless vessels by\r\nfirst-class new ones may involve an increase in the personnel; but not\r\nenough to interfere with our action along the lines you have suggested.\r\nBut before I would know how to advocate such action, save in some such\r\nway as commending it to the attention of The Hague Tribunal, I would\r\nhave to have a feasible and rational plan of action presented.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that a general stop in the increase of the war navies\r\nof the world _might_ be a good thing; but I would not like to speak too\r\npositively offhand. Of course it is only in continental Europe that the\r\narmies are too large; and before advocating action as regards them I\r\nshould have to weigh matters carefully--including by the way such a\r\nmatter as the Turkish army. At any rate nothing useful can be done\r\nunless with the clear recognition that we object to putting peace second\r\nto righteousness.\r\n\r\nSincerely yours, THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\nHON. CARL SCHURZ, Bolton Landing, Lake George, N. Y.\r\n\r\nIn my own judgment the most important service that I rendered to\r\npeace was the voyage of the battle fleet round the world. I had become\r\nconvinced that for many reasons it was essential that we should have\r\nit clearly understood, by our own people especially, but also by other\r\npeoples, that the Pacific was as much our home waters as the Atlantic,\r\nand that our fleet could and would at will pass from one to the other of\r\nthe two great oceans. It seemed to me evident that such a voyage would\r\ngreatly benefit the navy itself; would arouse popular interest in and\r\nenthusiasm for the navy; and would make foreign nations accept as a\r\nmatter of course that our fleet should from time to time be gathered in\r\nthe Pacific, just as from time to time it was gathered in the Atlantic,\r\nand that its presence in one ocean was no more to be accepted as a mark\r\nof hostility to any Asiatic power than its presence in the Atlantic\r\nwas to be accepted as a mark of hostility to any European power. I\r\ndetermined on the move without consulting the Cabinet, precisely as\r\nI took Panama without consulting the Cabinet. A council of war never\r\nfights, and in a crisis the duty of a leader is to lead and not to take\r\nrefuge behind the generally timid wisdom of a multitude of councillors.\r\nAt that time, as I happen to know, neither the English nor the German\r\nauthorities believed it possible to take a fleet of great battleships\r\nround the world. They did not believe that their own fleets could\r\nperform the feat, and still less did they believe that the American\r\nfleet could. I made up my mind that it was time to have a show down in\r\nthe matter; because if it was really true that our fleet could not get\r\nfrom the Atlantic to the Pacific, it was much better to know it and be\r\nable to shape our policy in view of the knowledge. Many persons publicly\r\nand privately protested against the move on the ground that Japan would\r\naccept it as a threat. To this I answered nothing in public. In private\r\nI said that I did not believe Japan would so regard it because Japan\r\nknew my sincere friendship and admiration for her and realized that we\r\ncould not as a Nation have any intention of attacking her; and that if\r\nthere were any such feeling on the part of Japan as was alleged that\r\nvery fact rendered it imperative that that fleet should go. When in the\r\nspring of 1910 I was in Europe I was interested to find that high naval\r\nauthorities in both Germany and Italy had expected that war would come\r\nat the time of the voyage. They asked me if I had not been afraid of it,\r\nand if I had not expected that hostilities would begin at least by the\r\ntime that the fleet reached the Straits of Magellan? I answered that I\r\ndid not expect it; that I believed that Japan would feel as friendly in\r\nthe matter as we did; but that if my expectations had proved mistaken,\r\nit would have been proof positive that we were going to be attacked\r\nanyhow, and that in such event it would have been an enormous gain to\r\nhave had the three months' preliminary preparation which enabled the\r\nfleet to start perfectly equipped. In a personal interview before they\r\nleft I had explained to the officers in command that I believed the trip\r\nwould be one of absolute peace, but that they were to take exactly the\r\nsame precautions against sudden attack of any kind as if we were at war\r\nwith all the nations of the earth; and that no excuse of any kind would\r\nbe accepted if there were a sudden attack of any kind and we were taken\r\nunawares.\r\n\r\nMy prime purpose was to impress the American people; and this purpose\r\nwas fully achieved. The cruise did make a very deep impression abroad;\r\nboasting about what we have done does not impress foreign nations at\r\nall, except unfavorably, but positive achievement does; and the two\r\nAmerican achievements that really impressed foreign peoples during the\r\nfirst dozen years of this century were the digging of the Panama Canal\r\nand the cruise of the battle fleet round the world. But the impression\r\nmade on our own people was of far greater consequence. No single\r\nthing in the history of the new United States Navy has done as much to\r\nstimulate popular interest and belief in it as the world cruise. This\r\neffect was forecast in a well-informed and friendly English periodical,\r\nthe London _Spectator_. Writing in October, 1907, a month before the\r\nfleet sailed from Hampton Roads, the _Spectator said_:\r\n\r\n\"All over America the people will follow the movements of the fleet;\r\nthey will learn something of the intricate details of the coaling\r\nand commissariat work under warlike conditions; and in a word\r\ntheir attention will be aroused. Next time Mr. Roosevelt or his\r\nrepresentatives appeal to the country for new battleships they will do\r\nso to people whose minds have been influenced one way or the other. The\r\nnaval programme will not have stood still. We are sure that, apart from\r\nincreasing the efficiency of the existing fleet, this is the aim which\r\nMr. Roosevelt has in mind. He has a policy which projects itself far\r\ninto the future, but it is an entire misreading of it to suppose that it\r\nis aimed narrowly and definitely at any single Power.\"\r\n\r\nI first directed the fleet, of sixteen battleships, to go round through\r\nthe Straits of Magellan to San Francisco. From thence I ordered them to\r\nNew Zealand and Australia, then to the Philippines, China and Japan,\r\nand home through Suez--they stopped in the Mediterranean to help the\r\nsufferers from the earthquake at Messina, by the way, and did this work\r\nas effectively as they had done all their other work. Admiral Evans\r\ncommanded the fleet to San Francisco; there Admiral Sperry took it;\r\nAdmirals Thomas, Wainwright and Schroeder rendered distinguished service\r\nunder Evans and Sperry. The coaling and other preparations were made in\r\nsuch excellent shape by the Department that there was never a hitch, not\r\nso much as the delay of an hour, in keeping every appointment made.\r\nAll the repairs were made without difficulty, the ship concerned\r\nmerely falling out of column for a few hours, and when the job was done\r\nsteaming at speed until she regained her position. Not a ship was left\r\nin any port; and there was hardly a desertion. As soon as it was known\r\nthat the voyage was to be undertaken men crowded to enlist, just as\r\nfreely from the Mississippi Valley as from the seaboard, and for the\r\nfirst time since the Spanish War the ships put to sea overmanned--and by\r\nas stalwart a set of men-of-war's men as ever looked through a porthole,\r\ngame for a fight or a frolic, but withal so self-respecting and with\r\nsuch a sense of responsibility that in all the ports in which they\r\nlanded their conduct was exemplary. The fleet practiced incessantly\r\nduring the voyage, both with the guns and in battle tactics, and came\r\nhome a much more efficient fighting instrument than when it started\r\nsixteen months before.\r\n\r\nThe best men of command rank in our own service were confident that the\r\nfleet would go round in safety, in spite of the incredulity of foreign\r\ncritics. Even they, however, did not believe that it was wise to send\r\nthe torpedo craft around. I accordingly acquiesced in their views, as it\r\ndid not occur to me to consult the lieutenants. But shortly before the\r\nfleet started, I went in the Government yacht Mayflower to inspect the\r\ntarget practice off Provincetown. I was accompanied by two torpedo\r\nboat destroyers, in charge of a couple of naval lieutenants, thorough\r\ngamecocks; and I had the two lieutenants aboard to dine one evening.\r\nTowards the end of the dinner they could not refrain from asking if the\r\ntorpedo flotilla was to go round with the big ships. I told them no,\r\nthat the admirals and captains did not believe that the torpedo boats\r\ncould stand it, and believed that the officers and crews aboard the\r\ncockle shells would be worn out by the constant pitching and bouncing\r\nand the everlasting need to make repairs. My two guests chorused an\r\neager assurance that the boats could stand it. They assured me that\r\nthe enlisted men were even more anxious to go than were the officers,\r\nmentioning that on one of their boats the terms of enlistment of most\r\nof the crew were out, and the men were waiting to see whether or not to\r\nreenlist, as they did not care to do so unless the boats were to go on\r\nthe cruise. I answered that I was only too glad to accept the word of\r\nthe men who were to do the job, and that they should certainly go; and\r\nwithin half an hour I sent out the order for the flotilla to be got\r\nready. It went round in fine shape, not a boat being laid up. I felt\r\nthat the feat reflected even more credit upon the navy than did the\r\ncircumnavigation of the big ships, and I wrote the flotilla commander\r\nthe following letter:\r\n\r\nMay 18, 1908.\r\n\r\nMy dear Captain Cone:\r\n\r\nA great deal of attention has been paid to the feat of our battleship\r\nfleet in encircling South America and getting to San Francisco; and it\r\nwould be hard too highly to compliment the officers and enlisted men of\r\nthat fleet for what they have done. Yet if I should draw any distinction\r\nat all it would be in favor of you and your associates who have taken\r\nout the torpedo flotilla. Yours was an even more notable feat, and every\r\nofficer and every enlisted man in the torpedo boat flotilla has the\r\nright to feel that he has rendered distinguished service to the United\r\nStates navy and therefore to the people of the United States; and I wish\r\nI could thank each of them personally. Will you have this letter read by\r\nthe commanding officer of each torpedo boat to his officers and crew?\r\n\r\nSincerely yours, THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\nLIEUTENANT COMMANDER HUTCH. I. CONE, U. S. N., Commanding Second Torpedo\r\nFlotilla, Care Postmaster, San Francisco, Cal.\r\n\r\nThere were various amusing features connected with the trip. Most of\r\nthe wealthy people and \"leaders of opinion\" in the Eastern cities\r\nwere panic-struck at the proposal to take the fleet away from Atlantic\r\nwaters. The great New York dailies issued frantic appeals to Congress\r\nto stop the fleet from going. The head of the Senate Committee on Naval\r\nAffairs announced that the fleet should not and could not go because\r\nCongress would refuse to appropriate the money--he being from an Eastern\r\nseaboard State. However, I announced in response that I had enough money\r\nto take the fleet around to the Pacific anyhow, that the fleet would\r\ncertainly go, and that if Congress did not choose to appropriate enough\r\nmoney to get the fleet back, why, it would stay in the Pacific. There\r\nwas no further difficulty about the money.\r\n\r\nIt was not originally my intention that the fleet should visit\r\nAustralia, but the Australian Government sent a most cordial invitation,\r\nwhich I gladly accepted; for I have, as every American ought to have, a\r\nhearty admiration for, and fellow feeling with, Australia, and I believe\r\nthat America should be ready to stand back of Australia in any serious\r\nemergency. The reception accorded the fleet in Australia was wonderful,\r\nand it showed the fundamental community of feeling between ourselves and\r\nthe great commonwealth of the South Seas. The considerate, generous, and\r\nopen-handed hospitality with which the entire Australian people treated\r\nour officers and men could not have been surpassed had they been our\r\nown countrymen. The fleet first visited Sydney, which has a singularly\r\nbeautiful harbor. The day after the arrival one of our captains noticed\r\na member of his crew trying to go to sleep on a bench in the park.\r\nHe had fixed above his head a large paper with some lines evidently\r\ndesigned to forestall any questions from friendly would-be hosts: \"I am\r\ndelighted with the Australian people. I think your harbor the finest in\r\nthe world. I am very tired and would like to go to sleep.\"\r\n\r\nThe most noteworthy incident of the cruise was the reception given to\r\nour fleet in Japan. In courtesy and good breeding, the Japanese can\r\ncertainly teach much to the nations of the Western world. I had been\r\nvery sure that the people of Japan would understand aright what the\r\ncruise meant, and would accept the visit of our fleet as the signal\r\nhonor which it was meant to be, a proof of the high regard and\r\nfriendship I felt, and which I was certain the American people felt,\r\nfor the great Island Empire. The event even surpassed my expectations. I\r\ncannot too strongly express my appreciation of the generous courtesy the\r\nJapanese showed the officers and crews of our fleet; and I may add\r\nthat every man of them came back a friend and admirer of the Japanese.\r\nAdmiral Sperry wrote me a letter of much interest, dealing not only with\r\nthe reception in Tokyo but with the work of our men at sea; I herewith\r\ngive it almost in full:\r\n\r\n28 October, 1908.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Roosevelt:\r\n\r\nMy official report of the visit to Japan goes forward in this mail, but\r\nthere are certain aspects of the affair so successfully concluded which\r\ncannot well be included in the report.\r\n\r\nYou are perhaps aware that Mr. Denison of the Japanese Foreign Office\r\nwas one of my colleagues at The Hague, for whom I have a very\r\nhigh regard. Desiring to avoid every possibility of trouble or\r\nmisunderstanding, I wrote to him last June explaining fully the\r\ncharacter of our men, which they have so well lived up to, the\r\ndesirability of ample landing places, guides, rest houses and places for\r\nchanging money in order that there might be no delay in getting the men\r\naway from the docks on the excursions in which they delight. Very few of\r\nthem go into a drinking place, except to get a resting place not to be\r\nfound elsewhere, paying for it by taking a drink.\r\n\r\nI also explained our system of landing with liberty men an unarmed\r\npatrol, properly officered, to quietly take in charge and send off\r\nto their ships any men who showed the slightest trace of disorderly\r\nconduct. This letter he showed to the Minister of the Navy, who highly\r\napproved of all our arrangements, including the patrol, of which I\r\nfeared they might be jealous. Mr. Denison's reply reached me in Manila,\r\nwith a memorandum from the Minister of the Navy which removed all\r\ndoubts. Three temporary piers were built for our boat landings, each\r\n300 feet long, brilliantly lighted and decorated. The sleeping\r\naccommodations did not permit two or three thousand sailors to remain on\r\nshore, but the ample landings permitted them to be handled night and day\r\nwith perfect order and safety.\r\n\r\nAt the landings and railroad station in Yokohama there were rest\r\nhouses or booths, reputable money changers and as many as a thousand\r\nEnglish-speaking Japanese college students acted as volunteer guides,\r\nbesides Japanese sailors and petty officers detailed for the purpose.\r\nIn Tokyo there were a great many excellent refreshment places, where the\r\nmen got excellent meals and could rest, smoke, and write letters, and\r\nin none of these places would they allow the men to pay anything, though\r\nthey were more than ready to do so. The arrangements were marvelously\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\nAs soon as your telegram of October 18, giving the address to be made to\r\nthe Emperor, was received, I gave copies of it to our Ambassador to\r\nbe sent to the Foreign Office. It seems that the Emperor had already\r\nprepared a very cordial address to be forwarded through me to you, after\r\ndelivery at the audience, but your telegram reversed the situation and\r\nhis reply was prepared. I am convinced that your kind and courteous\r\ninitiative on this occasion helped cause the pleasant feeling which was\r\nso obvious in the Emperor's bearing at the luncheon which followed the\r\naudience. X., who is reticent and conservative, told me that not only\r\nthe Emperor but all the Ministers were profoundly gratified by the\r\ncourse of events. I am confident that not even the most trifling\r\nincident has taken place which could in any way mar the general\r\nsatisfaction, and our Ambassador has expressed to me his great\r\nsatisfaction with all that has taken place.\r\n\r\nOwing to heavy weather encountered on the passage up from Manila the\r\nfleet was obliged to take about 3500 tons of coal.\r\n\r\nThe Yankton remained behind to keep up communication for a few days, and\r\nyesterday she transmitted the Emperor's telegram to you, which was sent\r\nin reply to your message through our Ambassador after the sailing of the\r\nfleet. It must be profoundly gratifying to you to have the mission\r\non which you sent the fleet terminate so happily, and I am profoundly\r\nthankful that, owing to the confidence which you displayed in giving\r\nme this command, my active career draws to a close with such honorable\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nAs for the effect of the cruise upon the training, discipline and\r\neffectiveness of the fleet, the good cannot be exaggerated. It is a war\r\ngame in every detail. The wireless communication has been maintained\r\nwith an efficiency hitherto unheard of. Between Honolulu and Auckland,\r\n3850 miles, we were out of communication with a cable station for only\r\none night, whereas three [non-American] men-of-war trying recently to\r\nmaintain a chain of only 1250 miles, between Auckland and Sydney, were\r\nonly able to do so for a few hours.\r\n\r\nThe officers and men as soon as we put to sea turn to their gunnery and\r\ntactical work far more eagerly than they go to functions. Every morning\r\ncertain ships leave the column and move off seven or eight thousand\r\nyards as targets for range measuring fire control and battery practice\r\nfor the others, and at night certain ships do the same thing for\r\nnight battery practice. I am sorry to say that this practice is\r\nunsatisfactory, and in some points misleading, owing to the fact\r\nthat the ships are painted white. At Portland, in 1903, I saw Admiral\r\nBarker's white battleships under the searchlights of the army at a\r\ndistance of 14,000 yards, seven sea miles, without glasses, while the\r\nHartford, a black ship, was never discovered at all, though she passed\r\nwithin a mile and a half. I have for years, while a member of the\r\nGeneral Board, advocated painting the ships war color at all times, and\r\nby this mail I am asking the Department to make the necessary change in\r\nthe Regulations and paint the ships properly. I do not know that any one\r\nnow dissents from my view. Admiral Wainwright strongly concurs, and\r\nthe War College Conference recommended it year after year without a\r\ndissenting voice.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoons the fleet has two or three hours' practice at battle\r\nmaneuvers, which excite as keen interest as gunnery exercises.\r\n\r\nThe competition in coal economy goes on automatically and reacts in a\r\nhundred ways. It has reduced the waste in the use of electric light and\r\nwater, and certain chief engineers are said to keep men ranging over the\r\nships all night turning out every light not in actual and immediate use.\r\nPerhaps the most important effect is the keen hunt for defects in\r\nthe machinery causing waste of power. The Yankton by resetting valves\r\nincreased her speed from 10 to 11 1/2 knots on the same expenditure.\r\n\r\nAll this has been done, but the field is widening, the work has only\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nC. S. SPERRY.\r\n\r\nWhen I left the Presidency I finished seven and a half years of\r\nadministration, during which not one shot had been fired against a\r\nforeign foe. We were at absolute peace, and there was no nation in the\r\nworld with whom a war cloud threatened, no nation in the world whom we\r\nhad wronged, or from whom we had anything to fear. The cruise of the\r\nbattle fleet was not the least of the causes which ensured so peaceful\r\nan outlook.\r\n\r\nWhen the fleet returned after its sixteen months' voyage around the\r\nworld I went down to Hampton Roads to greet it. The day was Washington's\r\nBirthday, February 22, 1907. Literally on the minute the homing\r\nbattlecraft came into view. On the flagship of the Admiral I spoke to\r\nthe officers and enlisted men, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Admiral Sperry, Officers and Men of the Battle Fleet:\r\n\r\n\"Over a year has passed since you steamed out of this harbor, and over\r\nthe world's rim, and this morning the hearts of all who saw you thrilled\r\nwith pride as the hulls of the mighty warships lifted above the horizon.\r\nYou have been in the Northern and the Southern Hemispheres; four times\r\nyou have crossed the line; you have steamed through all the great\r\noceans; you have touched the coast of every continent. Ever your general\r\ncourse has been westward; and now you come back to the port from\r\nwhich you set sail. This is the first battle fleet that has ever\r\ncircumnavigated the globe. Those who perform the feat again can but\r\nfollow in your footsteps.\r\n\r\n\"The little torpedo flotilla went with you around South America, through\r\nthe Straits of Magellan, to our own Pacific Coast. The armored cruiser\r\nsquadron met you, and left you again, when you were half way round the\r\nworld. You have falsified every prediction of the prophets of failure.\r\nIn all your long cruise not an accident worthy of mention has happened\r\nto a single battleship, nor yet to the cruisers or torpedo boats. You\r\nleft this coast in a high state of battle efficiency, and you return\r\nwith your efficiency increased; better prepared than when you left, not\r\nonly in personnel but even in material. During your world cruise you\r\nhave taken your regular gunnery practice, and skilled though you were\r\nbefore with the guns, you have grown more skilful still; and through\r\npractice you have improved in battle tactics, though here there is more\r\nroom for improvement than in your gunnery. Incidentally, I suppose I\r\nneed hardly say that one measure of your fitness must be your clear\r\nrecognition of the need always steadily to strive to render yourselves\r\nmore fit; if you ever grow to think that you are fit enough, you can\r\nmake up your minds that from that moment you will begin to go backward.\r\n\r\n\"As a war-machine, the fleet comes back in better shape than it went\r\nout. In addition, you, the officers and men of this formidable fighting\r\nforce, have shown yourselves the best of all possible ambassadors and\r\nheralds of peace. Wherever you have landed you have borne yourselves\r\nso as to make us at home proud of being your countrymen. You have shown\r\nthat the best type of fighting man of the sea knows how to appear to\r\nthe utmost possible advantage when his business is to behave himself on\r\nshore, and to make a good impression in a foreign land. We are proud of\r\nall the ships and all the men in this whole fleet, and we welcome you\r\nhome to the country whose good repute among nations has been raised by\r\nwhat you have done.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A\r\n\r\nTHE TRUSTS, THE PEOPLE, AND THE SQUARE DEAL\r\n\r\n[Written when Mr. Taft's administration brought suit to dissolve the\r\nsteel corporation, one of the grounds for the suit being the acquisition\r\nby the Corporation of the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company; this action\r\nwas taken, with my acquiescence, while I was President, and while Mr.\r\nTaft was a member of my cabinet; at the time he never protested against,\r\nand as far as I knew approved of my action in this case, as in the\r\nHarvester Trust case, and all similar cases.]\r\n\r\nThe suit against the Steel Trust by the Government has brought vividly\r\nbefore our people the need of reducing to order our chaotic Government\r\npolicy as regards business. As President, in Messages to Congress I\r\nrepeatedly called the attention of that body and of the public to the\r\ninadequacy of the Anti-Trust Law by itself to meet business conditions\r\nand secure justice to the people, and to the further fact that it might,\r\nif left unsupplemented by additional legislation, work mischief, with no\r\ncompensating advantage; and I urged as strongly as I knew how that\r\nthe policy followed with relation to railways in connection with the\r\nInter-State Commerce Law should be followed by the National Government\r\nas regards all great business concerns; and therefore that, as a\r\nfirst step, the powers of the Bureau of Corporations should be greatly\r\nenlarged, or else that there should be created a Governmental board or\r\ncommission, with powers somewhat similar to those of the Inter-State\r\nCommerce Commission, but covering the whole field of inter-State\r\nbusiness, exclusive of transportation (which should, by law, be kept\r\nwholly separate from ordinary industrial business, all common ownership\r\nof the industry and the railway being forbidden). In the end I have\r\nalways believed that it would also be necessary to give the National\r\nGovernment complete power over the organization and capitalization of\r\nall business concerns engaged in inter-State commerce.\r\n\r\nA member of my Cabinet with whom, even more than with the various\r\nAttorneys-General, I went over every detail of the trust situation, was\r\nthe one time Secretary of the Interior, Mr. James R. Garfield. He writes\r\nme as follows concerning the suit against the Steel Corporation:\r\n\r\n\"Nothing appeared before the House Committee that made me believe we\r\nwere deceived by Judge Gary.\r\n\r\n\"This, I think, is a case that shows clearly the difference between\r\ndestructive litigation and constructive legislation. I have not yet seen\r\na full copy of the Government's petition, but our papers give nothing\r\nthat indicates any kind of unfair or dishonest competition such as\r\nexisted in both the Standard Oil and Tobacco Cases. As I understand it,\r\nthe competitors of the Steel Company have steadily increased in strength\r\nduring the last six or seven years. Furthermore, the per cent of the\r\nbusiness done by the Steel Corporation has decreased during that time.\r\nAs you will remember, at our first conference with Judge Gary, the Judge\r\nstated that it was the desire and purpose of the Company to conform\r\nto what the Government wished, it being the purpose of the Company\r\nabsolutely to obey the law both in spirit and letter. Throughout the\r\ntime that I had charge of the investigation, and while we were in\r\nWashington, I do not know of a single instance where the Steel Company\r\nrefused any information requested; but, on the contrary, aided in every\r\npossible way our investigation.\r\n\r\n\"The position now taken by the Government is absolutely destructive\r\nof legitimate business, because they outline no rule of conduct for\r\nbusiness of any magnitude. It is absurd to say that the courts can\r\nlay down such rules. The most the courts can do is to find as legal or\r\nillegal the particular transactions brought before them. Hence, after\r\nyears of tedious litigation there would be no clear-cut rule for future\r\naction. This method of procedure is dealing with the device, not the\r\nresult, and drives business to the elaboration of clever devices, each\r\nof which must be tested in the courts.\r\n\r\n\"I have yet to find a better method of dealing with the anti-trust\r\nsituation than that suggested by the bill which we agreed upon in the\r\nlast days of your Administration. That bill should be used as a basis\r\nfor legislation, and there could be incorporated upon it whatever may\r\nbe determined wise regarding the direct control and supervision of\r\nthe National Government, either through a commission similar to the\r\nInter-State Commerce Commission or otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nBefore taking up the matter in its large aspect, I wish to say one word\r\nas to one feature of the Government suit against the Steel Corporation.\r\nOne of the grounds for the suit is the acquisition by the Steel\r\nCorporation of the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company; and it has been\r\nalleged, on the authority of the Government officials engaged in\r\ncarrying on the suit, that as regards this transaction I was misled by\r\nthe representatives of the Steel Corporation, and that the facts were\r\nnot accurately or truthfully laid before me. This statement is not\r\ncorrect. I believed at the time that the facts in the case were as\r\nrepresented to me on behalf of the Steel Corporation, and my further\r\nknowledge has convinced me that this was true. I believed at the time\r\nthat the representatives of the Steel Corporation told me the truth as\r\nto the change that would be worked in the percentage of the business\r\nwhich the proposed acquisition would give the Steel Corporation, and\r\nfurther inquiry has convinced me that they did so. I was not misled. The\r\nrepresentatives of the Steel Corporation told me the truth as to what\r\nthe effect of the action at that time would be, and any statement that I\r\nwas misled or that the representatives of the Steel Corporation did\r\nnot thus tell me the truth as to the facts of the case is itself not in\r\naccordance with the truth. In _The Outlook_ of August 19 last I gave\r\nin full the statement I had made to the Investigating Committee of the\r\nHouse of Representatives on this matter. That statement is accurate, and\r\nI reaffirm everything I therein said, not only as to what occurred, but\r\nalso as to my belief in the wisdom and propriety of my action--indeed,\r\nthe action not merely was wise and proper, but it would have been a\r\ncalamity from every standpoint had I failed to take it. On page 137 of\r\nthe printed report of the testimony before the Committee will be found\r\nJudge Gary's account of the meeting between himself and Mr. Frick and\r\nMr. Root and myself. This account states the facts accurately. It has\r\nbeen alleged that the purchase by the Steel Corporation of the property\r\nof the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company gave the Steel Corporation\r\npractically a monopoly of the Southern iron ores--that is, of the iron\r\nores south of the Potomac and the Ohio. My information, which I\r\nhave every reason to believe is accurate and not successfully to be\r\nchallenged, is that, of these Southern iron ores the Steel Corporation\r\nhas, including the property gained from the Tennessee Coal and Iron\r\nCompany, less than 20 per cent--perhaps not over 16 per cent. This is\r\na very much smaller percentage than the percentage it holds of the Lake\r\nSuperior ores, which even after the surrender of the Hill lease will\r\nbe slightly over 50 per cent. According to my view, therefore,\r\nand unless--which I do not believe possible--these figures can be\r\nsuccessfully challenged, the acquisition of the Tennessee Coal and Iron\r\nCompany's ores in no way changed the situation as regards making the\r\nSteel Corporation a monopoly.[*] The showing as to the percentage of\r\nproduction of all kinds of steel ingots and steel castings in the\r\nUnited States by the Steel Corporation and by all other manufacturers\r\nrespectively makes an even stronger case. It makes the case even\r\nstronger than I put it in my testimony before the Investigating\r\nCommittee, for I was scrupulously careful to make statements that erred,\r\nif at all, against my own position. It appears from the figures of\r\nproduction that in 1901 the Steel Corporation had to its credit nearly\r\n66 per cent of the total production as against a little over 34 per cent\r\nby all other steel manufacturers. The percentage then shrank steadily,\r\nuntil in 1906, the year before the acquisition of the Tennessee Coal and\r\nIron properties, the percentage was a little under 58 per cent. In spite\r\nof the acquisition of these properties, the following year, 1907, the\r\ntotal percentage shrank slightly, and this shrinking has continued until\r\nin 1910 the total percentage of the Steel Corporation is but a little\r\nover 54 per cent, and the percentage by all other steel manufacturers\r\nbut a fraction less than 46 per cent. Of the 54 3_10 per cent produced\r\nby the Steel Corporation 1 9_10 per cent is produced by the former\r\nTennessee Coal and Iron Company. In other words, these figures show that\r\nthe acquisition of the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company did not in the\r\nslightest degree change the situation, and that during the ten\r\nyears which include the acquisition of these properties by the Steel\r\nCorporation the percentage of total output of steel manufacturers in\r\nthis country by the Steel Corporation has shrunk from nearly 66 per cent\r\nto but a trifle over 54 per cent. I do not believe that these figures\r\ncan be successfully controverted, and if not successfully controverted\r\nthey show clearly not only that the acquisition of the Tennessee\r\nCoal and Iron properties wrought no change in the status of the Steel\r\nCorporation, but that the Steel Corporation during the decade has\r\nsteadily lost, instead of gained, in monopolistic character.\r\n\r\n     [*] My own belief is that our Nation should long ago have\r\n     adopted the policy of merely leasing for a term of years\r\n     mineral-bearing land; but it is the fault of us ourselves,\r\n     of the people, not of the Steel Corporation, that this\r\n     policy has not been adopted.\r\n\r\nSo much for the facts in this particular case. Now for the general\r\nsubject. When my Administration took office, I found, not only that\r\nthere had been little real enforcement of the Anti-Trust Law and but\r\nlittle more effective enforcement of the Inter-State Commerce Law,\r\nbut also that the decisions were so chaotic and the laws themselves so\r\nvaguely drawn, or at least interpreted in such widely varying fashions,\r\nthat the biggest business men tended to treat both laws as dead letters.\r\nThe series of actions by which we succeeded in making the Inter-State\r\nCommerce Law an efficient and most useful instrument in regulating the\r\ntransportation of the country and exacting justice from the big railways\r\nwithout doing them injustice--while, indeed, on the contrary, securing\r\nthem against injustice--need not here be related. The Anti-Trust Law it\r\nwas also necessary to enforce as it had never hitherto been enforced;\r\nboth because it was on the statute-books and because it was imperative\r\nto teach the masters of the biggest corporations in the land that they\r\nwere not, and would not be permitted to regard themselves as, above\r\nthe law. Moreover, where the combination has really been guilty of\r\nmisconduct the law serves a useful purpose, and in such cases as those\r\nof the Standard Oil and Tobacco Trusts, if effectively enforced, the law\r\nconfers a real and great good.\r\n\r\nSuits were brought against the most powerful corporations in the land,\r\nwhich we were convinced had clearly and beyond question violated the\r\nAnti-Trust Law. These suits were brought with great care, and only where\r\nwe felt so sure of our facts that we could be fairly certain that\r\nthere was a likelihood of success. As a matter of fact, in most of the\r\nimportant suits we were successful. It was imperative that these suits\r\nshould be brought, and very real good was achieved by bringing them, for\r\nit was only these suits that made the great masters of corporate capital\r\nin America fully realize that they were the servants and not the masters\r\nof the people, that they were subject to the law, and that they would\r\nnot be permitted to be a law unto themselves; and the corporations\r\nagainst which we proceeded had sinned, not merely by being big (which\r\nwe did not regard as in itself a sin), but by being guilty of unfair\r\npractices towards their competitors, and by procuring fair advantages\r\nfrom the railways. But the resulting situation has made it evident that\r\nthe Anti-Trust Law is not adequate to meet the situation that has grown\r\nup because of modern business conditions and the accompanying tremendous\r\nincrease in the business use of vast quantities of corporate wealth. As\r\nI have said, this was already evident to my mind when I was President,\r\nand in communications to Congress I repeatedly stated the facts. But\r\nwhen I made these communications there were still plenty of people\r\nwho did not believe that we would succeed in the suits that had\r\nbeen instituted against the Standard Oil, the Tobacco, and other\r\ncorporations, and it was impossible to get the public as a whole to\r\nrealize what the situation was. Sincere zealots who believed that\r\nall combinations could be destroyed and the old-time conditions of\r\nunregulated competition restored, insincere politicians who knew better\r\nbut made believe that they thought whatever their constituents\r\nwished them to think, crafty reactionaries who wished to see on the\r\nstatute-books laws which they believed unenforceable, and the almost\r\nsolid \"Wall Street crowd\" or representatives of \"big business\" who at\r\nthat time opposed with equal violence both wise and necessary and unwise\r\nand improper regulation of business-all fought against the adoption of a\r\nsane, effective, and far-reaching policy.\r\n\r\nIt is a vitally necessary thing to have the persons in control of big\r\ntrusts of the character of the Standard Oil Trust and Tobacco Trust\r\ntaught that they are under the law, just as it was a necessary thing to\r\nhave the Sugar Trust taught the same lesson in drastic fashion by Mr.\r\nHenry L. Stimson when he was United States District Attorney in the\r\ncity of New York. But to attempt to meet the whole problem not by\r\nadministrative governmental action but by a succession of lawsuits is\r\nhopeless from the standpoint of working out a permanently satisfactory\r\nsolution. Moreover, the results sought to be achieved are achieved only\r\nin extremely insufficient and fragmentary measure by breaking up all big\r\ncorporations, whether they have behaved well or ill, into a number of\r\nlittle corporations which it is perfectly certain will be largely, and\r\nperhaps altogether, under the same control. Such action is harsh and\r\nmischievous if the corporation is guilty of nothing except its size; and\r\nwhere, as in the case of the Standard Oil, and especially the Tobacco,\r\ntrusts, the corporation has been guilty of immoral and anti-social\r\npractices, there is need for far more drastic and thoroughgoing action\r\nthan any that has been taken, under the recent decree of the Supreme\r\nCourt. In the case of the Tobacco Trust, for instance, the settlement in\r\nthe Circuit Court, in which the representatives of the Government\r\nseem inclined to concur, practically leaves all of the companies still\r\nsubstantially under the control of the twenty-nine original defendants.\r\nSuch a result is lamentable from the standpoint of justice. The decision\r\nof the Circuit Court, if allowed to stand, means that the Tobacco Trust\r\nhas merely been obliged to change its clothes, that none of the real\r\noffenders have received any real punishment, while, as the New York\r\nTimes, a pro-trust paper, says, the tobacco concerns, in their new\r\nclothes, are in positions of \"ease and luxury,\" and \"immune from\r\nprosecution under the law.\"\r\n\r\nSurely, miscarriage of justice is not too strong a term to apply to such\r\na result when considered in connection with what the Supreme Court said\r\nof this Trust. That great Court in its decision used language which,\r\nin spite of its habitual and severe self-restraint in stigmatizing\r\nwrong-doing, yet unhesitatingly condemns the Tobacco Trust for moral\r\nturpitude, saying that the case shows an \"ever present manifestation\r\n. . . of conscious wrong-doing\" by the Trust, whose history is \"replete\r\nwith the doing of acts which it was the obvious purpose of the statute\r\nto forbid, . . . demonstrative of the existence from the beginning of a\r\npurpose to acquire dominion and control of the tobacco trade, not by the\r\nmere exertion of the ordinary right to contract and to trade, but by\r\nmethods devised in order to monopolize the trade by driving competitors\r\nout of business, which were ruthlessly carried out upon the assumption\r\nthat to work upon the fears or play upon the cupidity of competitors\r\nwould make success possible.\" The letters from and to various officials\r\nof the Trust, which were put in evidence, show a literally astounding\r\nand horrifying indulgence by the Trust in wicked and depraved business\r\nmethods--such as the \"endeavor to cause a strike in their [a rival\r\nbusiness firm's] factory,\" or the \"shutting off the market\" of an\r\nindependent tobacco firm by \"taking the necessary steps to give them a\r\nwarm reception,\" or forcing importers into a price agreement by causing\r\nand continuing \"a demoralization of the business for such length of time\r\nas may be deemed desirable\" (I quote from the letters). A Trust guilty\r\nof such conduct should be absolutely disbanded, and the only way to\r\nprevent the repetition of such conduct is by strict Government\r\nsupervision, and not merely by lawsuits.\r\n\r\nThe Anti-Trust Law cannot meet the whole situation, nor can any\r\nmodification of the principle of the Anti-Trust Law avail to meet\r\nthe whole situation. The fact is that many of the men who have called\r\nthemselves Progressives, and who certainly believe that they are\r\nProgressives, represent in reality in this matter not progress at\r\nall but a kind of sincere rural toryism. These men believe that it is\r\npossible by strengthening the Anti-Trust Law to restore business to\r\nthe competitive conditions of the middle of the last century. Any such\r\neffort is foredoomed to end in failure, and, if successful, would\r\nbe mischievous to the last degree. Business cannot be successfully\r\nconducted in accordance with the practices and theories of sixty years\r\nago unless we abolish steam, electricity, big cities, and, in short, not\r\nonly all modern business and modern industrial conditions, but all the\r\nmodern conditions of our civilization. The effort to restore competition\r\nas it was sixty years ago, and to trust for justice solely to this\r\nproposed restoration of competition, is just as foolish as if we should\r\ngo back to the flintlocks of Washington's Continentals as a\r\nsubstitute for modern weapons of precision. The effort to prohibit all\r\ncombinations, good or bad, is bound to fail, and ought to fail; when\r\nmade, it merely means that some of the worst combinations are not\r\nchecked and that honest business is checked. Our purpose should be, not\r\nto strangle business as an incident of strangling combinations, but to\r\nregulate big corporations in thoroughgoing and effective fashion, so as\r\nto help legitimate business as an incident to thoroughly and completely\r\nsafeguarding the interests of the people as a whole. Against all such\r\nincrease of Government regulation the argument is raised that it\r\nwould amount to a form of Socialism. This argument is familiar; it is\r\nprecisely the same as that which was raised against the creation of\r\nthe Inter-State Commerce Commission, and of all the different utilities\r\ncommissions in the different States, as I myself saw, thirty years\r\nago, when I was a legislator at Albany, and these questions came up\r\nin connection with our State Government. Nor can action be effectively\r\ntaken by any one State. Congress alone has power under the Constitution\r\neffectively and thoroughly and at all points to deal with inter-State\r\ncommerce, and where Congress, as it should do, provides laws that\r\nwill give the Nation full jurisdiction over the whole field, then that\r\njurisdiction becomes, of necessity, exclusive--although until Congress\r\ndoes act affirmatively and thoroughly it is idle to expect that the\r\nStates will or ought to rest content with non-action on the part of both\r\nFederal and State authorities. This statement, by the way, applies also\r\nto the question of \"usurpation\" by any one branch of our Government\r\nof the rights of another branch. It is contended that in these recent\r\ndecisions the Supreme Court legislated; so it did; and it had to;\r\nbecause Congress had signally failed to do its duty by legislating.\r\nFor the Supreme Court to nullify an act of the Legislature as\r\nunconstitutional except on the clearest grounds is usurpation; to\r\ninterpret such an act in an obviously wrong sense is usurpation; but\r\nwhere the legislative body persistently leaves open a field which it\r\nis absolutely imperative, from the public standpoint, to fill, then no\r\npossible blame attaches to the official or officials who step in because\r\nthey have to, and who then do the needed work in the interest of the\r\npeople. The blame in such cases lies with the body which has been\r\nderelict, and not with the body which reluctantly makes good the\r\ndereliction.\r\n\r\nA quarter of a century ago, Senator Cushman K. Davis, a statesman who\r\namply deserved the title of statesman, a man of the highest courage, of\r\nthe sternest adherence to the principles laid down by an exacting sense\r\nof duty, an unflinching believer in democracy, who was as little to be\r\ncowed by a mob as by a plutocrat, and moreover a man who possessed the\r\npriceless gift of imagination, a gift as important to a statesman as to\r\na historian, in an address delivered at the annual commencement of\r\nthe University of Michigan on July 1, 1886, spoke as follows of\r\ncorporations:\r\n\r\n\"Feudalism, with its domains, its untaxed lords, their retainers,\r\nits exemptions and privileges, made war upon the aspiring spirit of\r\nhumanity, and fell with all its grandeurs. Its spirit walks the earth\r\nand haunts the institutions of to-day, in the great corporations, with\r\nthe control of the National highways, their occupation of great domains,\r\ntheir power to tax, their cynical contempt for the law, their sorcery\r\nto debase most gifted men to the capacity of splendid slaves, their\r\npollution of the ermine of the judge and the robe of the Senator, their\r\naggregation in one man of wealth so enormous as to make Croesus seem a\r\npauper, their picked, paid, and skilled retainers who are summoned by\r\nthe message of electricity and appear upon the wings of steam. If we\r\nlook into the origin of feudalism and of the modern corporations--those\r\nDromios of history--we find that the former originated in a strict\r\npaternalism, which is scouted by modern economists, and that the latter\r\nhas grown from an unrestrained freedom of action, aggression, and\r\ndevelopment, which they commend as the very ideal of political wisdom.\r\n_Laissez-faire_, says the professor, when it often means bind and gag\r\nthat the strongest may work his will. It is a plea for the survival of\r\nthe fittest--for the strongest male to take possession of the herd by\r\na process of extermination. If we examine this battle cry of political\r\npolemics, we find that it is based upon the conception of the divine\r\nright of property, and the preoccupation by older or more favored or\r\nmore alert or richer men or nations, of territory, of the forces of\r\nnature, of machinery, of all the functions of what we call civilization.\r\nSome of these men, who are really great, follow these conceptions to\r\ntheir conclusions with dauntless intrepidity.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Senator Davis spoke, few men of great power had the sympathy and\r\nthe vision necessary to perceive the menace contained in the growth of\r\ncorporations; and the men who did see the evil were struggling blindly\r\nto get rid of it, not by frankly meeting the new situation with new\r\nmethods, but by insisting upon the entirely futile effort to abolish\r\nwhat modern conditions had rendered absolutely inevitable. Senator Davis\r\nwas under no such illusion. He realized keenly that it was absolutely\r\nimpossible to go back to an outworn social status, and that we must\r\nabandon definitely the _laissez-faire_ theory of political economy, and\r\nfearlessly champion a system of increased Governmental control,\r\npaying no heed to the cries of the worthy people who denounce this as\r\nSocialistic. He saw that, in order to meet the inevitable increase in\r\nthe power of corporations produced by modern industrial conditions,\r\nit would be necessary to increase in like fashion the activity of the\r\nsovereign power which alone could control such corporations. As has\r\nbeen aptly said, the only way to meet a billion-dollar corporation is by\r\ninvoking the protection of a hundred-billion-dollar government; in other\r\nwords, of the National Government, for no State Government is strong\r\nenough both to do justice to corporations and to exact justice from\r\nthem. Said Senator Davis in this admirable address, which should be\r\nreprinted and distributed broadcast:\r\n\r\n\"The liberty of the individual has been annihilated by the logical\r\nprocess constructed to maintain it. We have come to a political\r\ndeification of Mammon. _Laissez-faire_ is not utterly blameworthy. It\r\nbegat modern democracy, and made the modern republic possible. There\r\ncan be no doubt of that. But there it reached its limit of political\r\nbenefaction, and began to incline toward the point where extremes meet.\r\n. . . To every assertion that the people in their collective capacity of\r\na government ought to exert their indefeasible right of self-defense, it\r\nis said you touch the sacred rights of property.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senator then goes on to say that we now have to deal with an\r\noligarchy of wealth, and that the Government must develop power\r\nsufficient enough to enable it to do the task.\r\n\r\nFew will dispute the fact that the present situation is not\r\nsatisfactory, and cannot be put on a permanently satisfactory basis\r\nunless we put an end to the period of groping and declare for a fixed\r\npolicy, a policy which shall clearly define and punish wrong-doing,\r\nwhich shall put a stop to the iniquities done in the name of business,\r\nbut which shall do strict equity to business. We demand that big\r\nbusiness give the people a square deal; in return we must insist that\r\nwhen any one engaged in big business honestly endeavors to do right\r\nhe shall himself be given a square deal; and the first, and most\r\nelementary, kind of square deal is to give him in advance full\r\ninformation as to just what he can, and what he cannot, legally and\r\nproperly do. It is absurd, and much worse than absurd, to treat the\r\ndeliberate lawbreaker as on an exact par with the man eager to obey the\r\nlaw, whose only desire is to find out from some competent Governmental\r\nauthority what the law is, and then to live up to it. Moreover, it is\r\nabsurd to treat the size of a corporation as in itself a crime. As\r\nJudge Hook says in his opinion in the Standard Oil Case: \"Magnitude\r\nof business does not alone constitute a monopoly . . . the genius and\r\nindustry of man when kept to ethical standards still have full play,\r\nand what he achieves is his . . . success and magnitude of business, the\r\nrewards of fair and honorable endeavor [are not forbidden] . . . [the\r\npublic welfare is threatened only when success is attained] by\r\nwrongful or unlawful methods.\" Size may, and in my opinion does, make a\r\ncorporation fraught with potential menace to the community; and may, and\r\nin my opinion should, therefore make it incumbent upon the community to\r\nexercise through its administrative (not merely through its judicial)\r\nofficers a strict supervision over that corporation in order to see\r\nthat it does not go wrong; but the size in itself does not signify\r\nwrong-doing, and should not be held to signify wrong-doing.\r\n\r\nNot only should any huge corporation which has gained its position\r\nby unfair methods, and by interference with the rights of others, by\r\ndemoralizing and corrupt practices, in short, by sheer baseness and\r\nwrong-doing, be broken up, but it should be made the business of some\r\nadministrative governmental body, by constant supervision, to see that\r\nit does not come together again, save under such strict control as shall\r\ninsure the community against all repetition of the bad conduct--and it\r\nshould never be permitted thus to assemble its parts as long as these\r\nparts are under the control of the original offenders, for actual\r\nexperience has shown that these men are, from the standpoint of the\r\npeople at large, unfit to be trusted with the power implied in the\r\nmanagement of a large corporation. But nothing of importance is\r\ngained by breaking up a huge inter-State and international industrial\r\norganization _which has not offended otherwise than by its size_, into\r\na number of small concerns without any attempt to regulate the way in\r\nwhich those concerns as a whole shall do business. Nothing is gained by\r\ndepriving the American Nation of good weapons wherewith to fight in the\r\ngreat field of international industrial competition. Those who would\r\nseek to restore the days of unlimited and uncontrolled competition, and\r\nwho believe that a panacea for our industrial and economic ills is to\r\nbe found in the mere breaking up of all big corporations, simply because\r\nthey are big, are attempting not only the impossible, but what, if\r\npossible, would be undesirable. They are acting as we should act if\r\nwe tried to dam the Mississippi, to stop its flow outright. The effort\r\nwould be certain to result in failure and disaster; we would have\r\nattempted the impossible, and so would have achieved nothing, or worse\r\nthan nothing. But by building levees along the Mississippi, not seeking\r\nto dam the stream, but to control it, we are able to achieve our object\r\nand to confer inestimable good in the course of so doing.\r\n\r\nThis Nation should definitely adopt the policy of attacking, not\r\nthe mere fact of combination, but the evils and wrong-doing which so\r\nfrequently accompany combination. The fact that a combination is very\r\nbig is ample reason for exercising a close and jealous supervision over\r\nit, because its size renders it potent for mischief; but it should not\r\nbe punished unless it actually does the mischief; it should merely be\r\nso supervised and controlled as to guarantee us, the people, against\r\nits doing mischief. We should not strive for a policy of unregulated\r\ncompetition and of the destruction of all big corporations, that is, of\r\nall the most efficient business industries in the land. Nor should\r\nwe persevere in the hopeless experiment of trying to regulate these\r\nindustries by means only of lawsuits, each lasting several years, and of\r\nuncertain result. We should enter upon a course of supervision, control,\r\nand regulation of these great corporations--a regulation which we should\r\nnot fear, if necessary, to bring to the point of control of monopoly\r\nprices, just as in exceptional cases railway rates are now regulated.\r\nEither the Bureau of Corporations should be authorized, or some other\r\ngovernmental body similar to the Inter-State Commerce Commission should\r\nbe created, to exercise this supervision, this authoritative control.\r\nWhen once immoral business practices have been eliminated by such\r\ncontrol, competition will thereby be again revived as a healthy factor,\r\nalthough not as formerly an all-sufficient factor, in keeping the\r\ngeneral business situation sound. Wherever immoral business practices\r\nstill obtain--as they obtained in the cases of the Standard Oil Trust\r\nand Tobacco Trust--the Anti-Trust Law can be invoked; and wherever such\r\na prosecution is successful, and the courts declare a corporation\r\nto possess a monopolistic character, then that corporation should be\r\ncompletely dissolved, and the parts ought never to be again assembled\r\nsave on whatever terms and under whatever conditions may be imposed by\r\nthe governmental body in which is vested the regulatory power. Methods\r\ncan readily be devised by which corporations sincerely desiring to\r\nact fairly and honestly can on their own initiative come under this\r\nthoroughgoing administrative control by the Government and thereby be\r\nfree from the working of the Anti-Trust Law. But the law will remain\r\nto be invoked against wrongdoers; and under such conditions it could be\r\ninvoked far more vigorously and successfully than at present.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary in an article like this to attempt to work out\r\nsuch a plan in detail. It can assuredly be worked out. Moreover, in my\r\nopinion, substantially some such plan must be worked out or business\r\nchaos will continue. Wrongdoing such as was perpetrated by the Standard\r\nOil Trust, and especially by the Tobacco Trust, should not only be\r\npunished, but if possible punished in the persons of the chief authors\r\nand beneficiaries of the wrong, far more severely than at present. But\r\npunishment should not be the only, or indeed the main, end in view. Our\r\naim should be a policy of construction and not one of destruction. Our\r\naim should not be to punish the men who have made a big corporation\r\nsuccessful merely because they have made it big and successful, but\r\nto exercise such thoroughgoing supervision and control over them as\r\nto insure their business skill being exercised in the interest of the\r\npublic and not against the public interest. Ultimately, I believe that\r\nthis control should undoubtedly indirectly or directly extend to dealing\r\nwith all questions connected with their treatment of their employees,\r\nincluding the wages, the hours of labor, and the like. Not only is the\r\nproper treatment of a corporation, from the standpoint of the managers,\r\nshareholders, and employees, compatible with securing from that\r\ncorporation the best standard of public service, but when the effort\r\nis wisely made it results in benefit both to the corporation and to the\r\npublic. The success of Wisconsin in dealing with the corporations within\r\nher borders, so as both to do them justice and to exact justice in\r\nreturn from them toward the public, has been signal; and this Nation\r\nshould adopt a progressive policy in substance akin to the progressive\r\npolicy not merely formulated in theory but reduced to actual practice\r\nwith such striking success in Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, then. It is practically impossible, and, if possible,\r\nit would be mischievous and undesirable, to try to break up all\r\ncombinations merely because they are large and successful, and to put\r\nthe business of the country back into the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury conditions of intense and unregulated competition between\r\nsmall and weak business concerns. Such an effort represents not\r\nprogressiveness but an unintelligent though doubtless entirely\r\nwell-meaning toryism. Moreover, the effort to administer a law merely\r\nby lawsuits and court decisions is bound to end in signal failure, and\r\nmeanwhile to be attended with delays and uncertainties, and to put a\r\npremium upon legal sharp practice. Such an effort does not adequately\r\npunish the guilty, and yet works great harm to the innocent. Moreover,\r\nit entirely fails to give the publicity which is one of the best\r\nby-products of the system of control by administrative officials;\r\npublicity, which is not only good in itself, but furnishes the data\r\nfor whatever further action may be necessary. We need to formulate\r\nimmediately and definitely a policy which, in dealing with big\r\ncorporations that behave themselves and which contain no menace save\r\nwhat is necessarily potential in any corporation which is of great size\r\nand very well managed, shall aim not at their destruction but at their\r\nregulation and supervision, so that the Government shall control them\r\nin such fashion as amply to safeguard the interests of the whole public,\r\nincluding producers, consumers, and wage-workers. This control should,\r\nif necessary, be pushed in extreme cases to the point of exercising\r\ncontrol over monopoly prices, as rates on railways are now controlled;\r\nalthough this is not a power that should be used when it is possible to\r\navoid it. The law should be clear, unambiguous, certain, so that honest\r\nmen may not find that unwittingly they have violated it. In short, our\r\naim should be, not to destroy, but effectively and in thoroughgoing\r\nfashion to regulate and control, in the public interest, the great\r\ninstrumentalities of modern business, which it is destructive of the\r\ngeneral welfare of the community to destroy, and which nevertheless it\r\nis vitally necessary to that general welfare to regulate and control.\r\nCompetition will remain as a very important factor when once we have\r\ndestroyed the unfair business methods, the criminal interference with\r\nthe rights of others, which alone enabled certain swollen combinations\r\nto crush out their competitors--and, incidentally, the \"conservatives\"\r\nwill do well to remember that these unfair and iniquitous methods by\r\ngreat masters of corporate capital have done more to cause popular\r\ndiscontent with the propertied classes than all the orations of all the\r\nSocialist orators in the country put together.\r\n\r\nI have spoken above of Senator Davis's admirable address delivered a\r\nquarter of a century ago. Senator Davis's one-time partner, Frank B.\r\nKellogg, the Government counsel who did so much to win success for the\r\nGovernment in its prosecutions of the trusts, has recently delivered\r\nbefore the Palimpsest Club of Omaha an excellent address on the subject;\r\nMr. Prouty, of the Inter-State Commerce Commission, has recently, in\r\nhis speech before the Congregational Club of Brooklyn, dealt with\r\nthe subject from the constructive side; and in the proceedings of the\r\nAmerican Bar Association for 1904 there is an admirable paper on\r\nthe need of thoroughgoing Federal control over corporations doing an\r\ninter-State business, by Professor Horace L. Wilgus, of the University\r\nof Michigan. The National Government exercises control over inter-State\r\ncommerce railways, and it can in similar fashion, through an appropriate\r\ngovernmental body, exercise control over all industrial organizations\r\nengaged in inter-State commerce. This control should be exercised, not\r\nby the courts, but by an administrative bureau or board such as the\r\nBureau of Corporations or the Inter-State Commerce Commission; for\r\nthe courts cannot with advantage permanently perform executive and\r\nadministrative functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B\r\n\r\nTHE CONTROL OF CORPORATIONS AND \"THE NEW FREEDOM\"\r\n\r\nIn his book \"The New Freedom,\" and in the magazine articles of which\r\nit is composed, which appeared just after he had been inaugurated as\r\nPresident, Mr. Woodrow Wilson made an entirely unprovoked attack upon\r\nme and upon the Progressive party in connection with what he asserts\r\nthe policy of that party to be concerning the trusts, and as regards my\r\nattitude while President about the trusts.\r\n\r\nI am reluctant to say anything whatever about President Wilson at the\r\noutset of his Administration unless I can speak of him with praise.\r\nI have scrupulously refrained from saying or doing one thing\r\nsince election that could put the slightest obstacle, even of\r\nmisinterpretation, in his path. It is to the interest of the country\r\nthat he should succeed in his office. I cordially wish him success, and\r\nI shall cordially support any policy of his that I believe to be in the\r\ninterests of the people of the United States. But when Mr. Wilson, after\r\nbeing elected President, within the first fortnight after he has been\r\ninaugurated into that high office, permits himself to be betrayed into\r\na public misstatement of what I have said, and what I stand for, then he\r\nforces me to correct his statements.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson opens his article by saying that the Progressive \"doctrine is\r\nthat monopoly is inevitable, and that the only course open to the people\r\nof the United States is to submit to it.\" This statement is without one\r\nparticle of foundation in fact. I challenge him to point out a sentence\r\nin the Progressive platform or in any speech of mine which bears him\r\nout. I can point him out any number which flatly contradict him. We have\r\nnever made any such statement as he alleges about monopolies. We have\r\nsaid: \"The corporation is an essential part of modern business. The\r\nconcentration of modern business, in some degree, is both inevitable and\r\nnecessary for National and international business efficiency.\" Does Mr.\r\nWilson deny this? Let him answer yes or no, directly. It is easy for\r\na politician detected in a misstatement to take refuge in evasive\r\nrhetorical hyperbole. But Mr. Wilson is President of the United States,\r\nand as such he is bound to candid utterance on every subject of public\r\ninterest which he himself has broached. If he disagrees with us, let him\r\nbe frank and consistent, and recommend to Congress that all corporations\r\nbe made illegal. Mr. Wilson's whole attack is largely based on a deft\r\nbut far from ingenuous confounding of what we have said of monopoly,\r\nwhich we propose so far as possible to abolish, and what we have said of\r\nbig corporations, which we propose to regulate; Mr. Wilson's own vaguely\r\nset forth proposals being to attempt the destruction of both in ways\r\nthat would harm neither. In our platform we use the word \"monopoly\" but\r\nonce, and then we speak of it as an abuse of power, coupling it with\r\nstock-watering, unfair competition and unfair privileges. Does Mr.\r\nWilson deny this? If he does, then where else will he assert that we\r\nspeak of monopoly as he says we do? He certainly owes the people of the\r\nUnited States a plain answer to the question. In my speech of acceptance\r\nI said: \"We favor strengthening the Sherman Law by prohibiting\r\nagreements to divide territory or limit output; refusing to sell to\r\ncustomers who buy from business rivals; to sell below cost in certain\r\nareas while maintaining higher prices in other places; using the power\r\nof transportation to aid or injure special business concerns; and all\r\nother unfair trade practices.\" The platform pledges us to \"guard and\r\nkeep open equally to all, the highways of American commerce.\" This is\r\nthe exact negation of monopoly. Unless Mr. Wilson is prepared to show\r\nthe contrary, surely he is bound in honor to admit frankly that he has\r\nbeen betrayed into a misrepresentation, and to correct it.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson says that for sixteen years the National Administration has\r\n\"been virtually under the regulation of the trusts,\" and that the big\r\nbusiness men \"have already captured the Government.\" Such a statement as\r\nthis might perhaps be pardoned as mere rhetoric in a candidate seeking\r\noffice--although it is the kind of statement that never under any\r\ncircumstances have I permitted myself to make, whether on the stump or\r\noff the stump, about any opponent, unless I was prepared to back it up\r\nwith explicit facts. But there is an added seriousness to the charge\r\nwhen it is made deliberately and in cold blood by a man who is at the\r\ntime President. In this volume I have set forth my relations with the\r\ntrusts. I challenge Mr. Wilson to controvert anything I have said, or to\r\nname any trusts or any big business men who regulated, or in any\r\nshape or way controlled, or captured, the Government during my term\r\nas President. He must furnish specifications if his words are taken at\r\ntheir face value--and I venture to say in advance that the absurdity\r\nof such a charge is patent to all my fellow-citizens, not excepting Mr.\r\nWilson.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson says that the new party was founded \"under the leadership of\r\nMr. Roosevelt, with the conspicuous aid--I mention him with no satirical\r\nintention, but merely to set the facts down accurately--of Mr. George W.\r\nPerkins, organizer of the Steel Trust.\" Whether Mr. Wilson's intention\r\nwas satirical or not is of no concern; but I call his attention to the\r\nfact that he has conspicuously and strikingly failed \"to set the facts\r\ndown accurately.\" Mr. Perkins was not the organizer of the Steel Trust,\r\nand when it was organized he had no connection with it or with the\r\nMorgan people. This is well known, and it has again and again been\r\ntestified to before Congressional committees controlled by Mr. Wilson's\r\nfriends who were endeavoring to find out something against Mr. Perkins.\r\nIf Mr. Wilson does not know that my statement is correct, he ought to\r\nknow it, and he is not to be excused for making such a misstatement as\r\nhe has made when he has not a particle of evidence in support of it.\r\nMr. Perkins was from the beginning in the Harvester Trust but, when Mr.\r\nWilson points out this fact, why does he not add that he was the only\r\nman in that trust who supported me, and that the President of the trust\r\nardently supported Mr. Wilson himself? It is disingenuous to endeavor to\r\nconceal these facts, and to mislead ordinary citizens about them. Under\r\nthe administrations of both Mr. Taft and Mr. Wilson, Mr. Perkins has\r\nbeen singled out for special attack, obviously not because he belonged\r\nto the Harvester and Steel Trusts, but because he alone among the\r\nprominent men of the two corporations, fearlessly supported the only\r\nparty which afforded any real hope of checking the evil of the trusts.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson states that the Progressives have \"a programme perfectly\r\nagreeable to monopolies.\"\r\n\r\nThe plain and unmistakable inference to be drawn from this and other\r\nsimilar statements in his article, and the inference which he obviously\r\ndesired to have drawn, is that the big corporations approved the\r\nProgressive plan and supported the Progressive candidate. If President\r\nWilson does not know perfectly well that this is not the case, he is\r\nthe only intelligent person in the United States who is thus ignorant.\r\nEverybody knows that the overwhelming majority of the heads of the big\r\ncorporations supported him or Mr. Taft. It is equally well known that of\r\nthe corporations he mentions, the Steel and the Harvester Trusts, there\r\nwas but one man who took any part in the Progressive campaign, and that\r\nalmost all the others, some thirty in number, were against us, and some\r\nof them, including the President of the Harvester Trust, openly and\r\nenthusiastically for Mr. Wilson himself. If he reads the newspapers\r\nat all, he must know that practically every man representing the\r\ngreat financial interests of the country, and without exception every\r\nnewspaper controlled by Wall Street or State Street, actively supported\r\neither him or Mr. Taft, and showed perfect willingness to accept either\r\nif only they could prevent the Progressive party from coming into power\r\nand from putting its platform into effect.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson says of the trust plank in that platform that it \"did not\r\nanywhere condemn monopoly except in words.\" Exactly of what else could a\r\nplatform consist? Does Mr. Wilson expect us to use algebraic signs? This\r\ncriticism is much as if he said the Constitution or the Declaration of\r\nIndependence contained nothing but words. The Progressive platform did\r\ncontain words, and the words were admirably designed to express thought\r\nand meaning and purpose. Mr. Wilson says that I long ago \"classified\r\ntrusts for us as good and bad,\" and said that I was \"afraid only of the\r\nbad ones.\" Mr. Wilson would do well to quote exactly what my language\r\nwas, and where it was used, for I am at a loss to know what statement\r\nof mine it is to which he refers. But if he means that I say that\r\ncorporations can do well, and that corporations can also do ill, he is\r\nstating my position correctly. I hold that a corporation does ill if it\r\nseeks profit in restricting production and then by extorting high prices\r\nfrom the community by reason of the scarcity of the product; through\r\nadulterating, lyingly advertising, or over-driving the help; or\r\nreplacing men workers with children; or by rebates; or in any illegal\r\nor improper manner driving competitors out of its way; or seeking to\r\nachieve monopoly by illegal or unethical treatment of its competitors,\r\nor in any shape or way offending against the moral law either in\r\nconnection with the public or with its employees or with its rivals. Any\r\ncorporation which seeks its profit in such fashion is acting badly.\r\nIt is, in fact, a conspiracy against the public welfare which the\r\nGovernment should use all its powers to suppress. If, on the other hand,\r\na corporation seeks profit solely by increasing its products through\r\neliminating waste, improving its processes, utilizing its by-products,\r\ninstalling better machines, raising wages in the effort to secure more\r\nefficient help, introducing the principle of cooperation and mutual\r\nbenefit, dealing fairly with labor unions, setting its face against\r\nthe underpayment of women and the employment of children; in a\r\nword, treating the public fairly and its rivals fairly: then such a\r\ncorporation is behaving well. It is an instrumentality of civilization\r\noperating to promote abundance by cheapening the cost of living so as to\r\nimprove conditions everywhere throughout the whole community. Does Mr.\r\nWilson controvert either of these statements? If so, let him answer\r\ndirectly. It is a matter of capital importance to the country that his\r\nposition in this respect be stated directly, not by indirect suggestion.\r\n\r\nMuch of Mr. Wilson's article, although apparently aimed at the\r\nProgressive party, is both so rhetorical and so vague as to need no\r\nanswer. He does, however, specifically assert (among other things\r\nequally without warrant in fact) that the Progressive party says that it\r\nis \"futile to undertake to prevent monopoly,\" and only ventures to\r\nask the trusts to be \"kind\" and \"pitiful\"! It is a little difficult\r\nto answer a misrepresentation of the facts so radical--not to say\r\npreposterous--with the respect that one desires to use in speaking of or\r\nto the President of the United States. I challenge President Wilson to\r\npoint to one sentence of our platform or of my speeches which affords\r\nthe faintest justification for these assertions. Having made this\r\nstatement in the course of an unprovoked attack on me, he cannot refuse\r\nto show that it is true. I deem it necessary to emphasize here (but with\r\nperfect respect) that I am asking for a plain statement of fact, not\r\nfor a display of rhetoric. I ask him, as is my right under the\r\ncircumstances, to quote the exact language which justifies him in\r\nattributing these views to us. If he cannot do this, then a frank\r\nacknowledgment on his part is due to himself and to the people. I quote\r\nfrom the Progressive platform: \"Behind the ostensible Government sits\r\nenthroned an invisible Government, owing no allegiance and acknowledging\r\nno responsibility to the people. To destroy this invisible Government,\r\nto dissolve the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt\r\npolitics, is the first task of the statesmanship of the day. . . . This\r\ncountry belongs to the people. Its resources, its business, its laws,\r\nits institutions, should be utilized, maintained, or altered in whatever\r\nmanner will best promote the general interest.\" This assertion is\r\nexplicit. We say directly that \"the people\" are absolutely to control in\r\nany way they see fit, the \"business\" of the country. I again challenge\r\nMr. Wilson to quote any words of the platform that justify the\r\nstatements he has made to the contrary. If he cannot do it--and of\r\ncourse he cannot do it, and he must know that he cannot do it--surely he\r\nwill not hesitate to say so frankly.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson must know that every monopoly in the United States opposes\r\nthe Progressive party. If he challenges this statement, I challenge him\r\nin return (as is clearly my right) to name the monopoly that did support\r\nthe Progressive party, whether it was the Sugar Trust, the Steel Trust,\r\nthe Harvester Trust, the Standard Oil Trust, the Tobacco Trust, or any\r\nother. Every sane man in the country knows well that there is not one\r\nword of justification that can truthfully be adduced for Mr. Wilson's\r\nstatement that the Progressive programme was agreeable to the\r\nmonopolies. Ours was the only programme to which they objected, and they\r\nsupported either Mr. Wilson or Mr. Taft against me, indifferent as to\r\nwhich of them might be elected so long as I was defeated. Mr. Wilson\r\nsays that I got my \"idea with regard to the regulation of monopoly from\r\nthe gentlemen who form the United States Steel Corporation.\" Does Mr.\r\nWilson pretend that Mr. Van Hise and Mr. Croly got their ideas from the\r\nSteel Corporation? Is Mr. Wilson unaware of the elementary fact that\r\nmost modern economists believe that unlimited, unregulated competition\r\nis the source of evils which all men now concede must be remedied if\r\nthis civilization of ours is to survive? Is he ignorant of the fact that\r\nthe Socialist party has long been against unlimited competition? This\r\nstatement of Mr. Wilson cannot be characterized properly with any degree\r\nof regard for the office Mr. Wilson holds. Why, the ideas that I\r\nhave championed as to controlling and regulating both competition and\r\ncombination in the interest of the people, so that the people shall be\r\nmasters over both, have been in the air in this country for a quarter of\r\na century. I was merely the first prominent candidate for President who\r\ntook them up. They are the progressive ideas, and progressive business\r\nmen must in the end come to them, for I firmly believe that in the\r\nend all wise and honest business men, big and little, will support our\r\nprogramme. Mr. Wilson in opposing them is the mere apostle of reaction.\r\nHe says that I got my \"ideas from the gentlemen who form the Steel\r\nCorporation.\" I did not. But I will point out to him something in\r\nreturn. It was he himself, and Mr. Taft, who got the votes and the money\r\nof these same gentlemen, and of those in the Harvester Trust.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson has promised to break up all trusts. He can do so only by\r\nproceeding at law. If he proceeds at law, he can hope for success\r\nonly by taking what I have done as a precedent. In fact, what I did as\r\nPresident is the base of every action now taken or that can be now\r\ntaken looking toward the control of corporations, or the suppression\r\nof monopolies. The decisions rendered in various cases brought by my\r\ndirection constitute the authority on which Mr. Wilson must base any\r\naction that he may bring to curb monopolistic control. Will Mr. Wilson\r\ndeny this, or question it in any way? With what grace can he describe\r\nmy Administration as satisfactory to the trusts when he knows that he\r\ncannot redeem a single promise that he has made to war upon the trusts\r\nunless he avails himself of weapons of which the Federal Government had\r\nbeen deprived before I became President, and which were restored to\r\nit during my Administration and through proceedings which I directed?\r\nWithout my action Mr. Wilson could not now undertake or carry on a\r\nsingle suit against a monopoly, and, moreover, if it had not been for my\r\naction and for the judicial decision in consequence obtained, Congress\r\nwould be helpless to pass a single law against monopoly.\r\n\r\nLet Mr. Wilson mark that the men who organized and directed the Northern\r\nSecurities Company were also the controlling forces in the very Steel\r\nCorporation which Mr. Wilson makes believe to think was supporting me.\r\nI challenge Mr. Wilson to deny this, and yet he well knew that it was\r\nmy successful suit against the Northern Securities Company which first\r\nefficiently established the power of the people over the trusts.\r\n\r\nAfter reading Mr. Wilson's book, I am still entirely in the dark as to\r\nwhat he means by the \"New Freedom.\" Mr. Wilson is an accomplished and\r\nscholarly man, a master of rhetoric, and the sentences in the book are\r\nwell-phrased statements, usually inculcating a morality which is sound\r\nalthough vague and ill defined. There are certain proposals (already\r\nlong set forth and practiced by me and by others who have recently\r\nformed the Progressive party) made by Mr. Wilson with which I cordially\r\nagree. There are, however, certain things he has said, even as regards\r\nmatters of abstract morality, with which I emphatically disagree.\r\nFor example, in arguing for proper business publicity, as to which I\r\ncordially agree with Mr. Wilson, he commits himself to the following\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n\"You know there is temptation in loneliness and secrecy. Haven't you\r\nexperienced it? I have. We are never so proper in our conduct as when\r\neverybody can look and see exactly what we are doing. If you are off in\r\nsome distant part of the world and suppose that nobody who lives within\r\na mile of your home is anywhere around, there are times when you adjourn\r\nyour ordinary standards. You say to yourself, 'Well, I'll have a fling\r\nthis time; nobody will know anything about it.' If you were on the\r\nDesert of Sahara, you would feel that you might permit yourself--well,\r\nsay, some slight latitude of conduct; but if you saw one of your\r\nimmediate neighbors coming the other way on a camel, you would behave\r\nyourself until he got out of sight. The most dangerous thing in the\r\nworld is to get off where nobody knows you. I advise you to stay around\r\namong the neighbors, and then you may keep out of jail. That is the only\r\nway some of us can keep out of jail.\"\r\n\r\nI emphatically disagree with what seems to be the morality inculcated\r\nin this statement, which is that a man is expected to do and is to be\r\npardoned for doing all kinds of immoral things if he does them alone\r\nand does not expect to be found out. Surely it is not necessary, in\r\ninsisting upon proper publicity, to preach a morality of so basely\r\nmaterial a character.\r\n\r\nThere is much more that Mr. Wilson says as to which I do not understand\r\nhim clearly, and where I condemn what I do understand. In economic\r\nmatters the course he advocates as part of the \"New Freedom\" simply\r\nmeans the old, old \"freedom\" of leaving the individual strong man\r\nat liberty, unchecked by common action, to prey on the weak and the\r\nhelpless. The \"New Freedom\" in the abstract seems to be the freedom\r\nof the big to devour the little. In the concrete I may add that Mr.\r\nWilson's misrepresentations of what I have said seem to indicate that he\r\nregards the new freedom as freedom from all obligation to obey the Ninth\r\nCommandment.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, my views or the principles of the Progressive party are\r\nof much less importance now than the purposes of Mr. Wilson. These are\r\nwrapped in impenetrable mystery. His speeches and writings serve but\r\nto make them more obscure. If these attempts to refute his\r\nmisrepresentation of my attitude towards the trusts should result in\r\nmaking his own clear, then this discussion will have borne fruits of\r\nsubstantial value to the country. If Mr. Wilson has any plan of his\r\nown for dealing with the trusts, it is to suppress all great industrial\r\norganizations--presumably on the principle proclaimed by his Secretary\r\nof State four years ago, that every corporation which produced more than\r\na certain percentage of a given commodity--I think the amount specified\r\nwas twenty-five per cent--no matter how valuable its service, should be\r\nsuppressed. The simple fact is that such a plan is futile. In operation\r\nit would do far more damage than it could remedy. The Progressive plan\r\nwould give the people full control of, and in masterful fashion prevent\r\nall wrongdoing by, the trusts, while utilizing for the public welfare\r\nevery industrial energy and ability that operates to swell abundance,\r\nwhile obeying strictly the moral law and the law of the land. Mr.\r\nWilson's plan would ultimately benefit the trusts and would permanently\r\ndamage nobody but the people. For example, one of the steel corporations\r\nwhich has been guilty of the worst practices towards its employees is\r\nthe Colorado Fuel and Iron Company. Mr. Wilson and Mr. Bryan's plan\r\nwould, if successful, merely mean permitting four such companies,\r\nabsolutely uncontrolled, to monopolize every big industry in the\r\ncountry. To talk of such an accomplishment as being \"The New Freedom\" is\r\nenough to make the term one of contemptuous derision.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson has made explicit promises, and the Democratic\r\nplatform has made explicit promises. Mr. Wilson is now in power, with\r\na Democratic Congress in both branches. He and the Democratic platform\r\nhave promised to destroy the trusts, to reduce the cost of living, and\r\nat the same time to increase the well-being of the farmer and of the\r\nworkingman--which of course must mean to increase the profits of\r\nthe farmer and the wages of the workingman. He and his party won the\r\nelection on this promise. We have a right to expect that they will keep\r\nit. If Mr. Wilson's promises mean anything except the very emptiest\r\nwords, he is pledged to accomplish the beneficent purposes he avows by\r\nbreaking up all the trusts and combinations and corporations so as to\r\nrestore competition precisely as it was fifty years ago. If he does not\r\nmean this, he means nothing. He cannot do anything else under penalty\r\nof showing that his promise and his performance do not square with each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson says that \"the trusts are our masters now, but I for one\r\ndo not care to live in a country called free even under kind masters.\"\r\nGood! The Progressives are opposed to having masters, kind or unkind,\r\nand they do not believe that a \"new freedom\" which in practice would\r\nmean leaving four Fuel and Iron Companies free to do what they like in\r\nevery industry would be of much benefit to the country. The Progressives\r\nhave a clear and definite programme by which the people would be the\r\nmasters of the trusts instead of the trusts being their masters, as Mr.\r\nWilson says they are. With practical unanimity the trusts supported the\r\nopponents of this programme, Mr. Taft and Mr. Wilson, and they evidently\r\ndreaded our programme infinitely more than anything that Mr. Wilson\r\nthreatened. The people have accepted Mr. Wilson's assurances. Now let\r\nhim make his promises good. He is committed, if his words mean anything,\r\nto the promise to break up every trust, every big corporation--perhaps\r\nevery small corporation--in the United States--not to go through\r\nthe motions of breaking them up, but really to break them up. He is\r\ncommitted against the policy (of efficient control and mastery of\r\nthe big corporations both by law and by administrative action in\r\ncooperation) proposed by the Progressives. Let him keep faith with\r\nthe people; let him in good faith try to keep the promises he has thus\r\nrepeatedly made. I believe that his promise is futile and cannot be\r\nkept. I believe that any attempt sincerely to keep it and in good faith\r\nto carry it out will end in either nothing at all or in disaster. But my\r\nbeliefs are of no consequence. Mr. Wilson is President. It is his acts\r\nthat are of consequence. He is bound in honor to the people of the\r\nUnited States to keep his promise, and to break up, not nominally but in\r\nreality, all big business, all trusts, all combinations of every sort,\r\nkind, and description, and probably all corporations. What he says is\r\nhenceforth of little consequence. The important thing is what he\r\ndoes, and how the results of what he does square with the promises and\r\nprophecies he made when all he had to do was to speak, not to act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C\r\n\r\nTHE BLAINE CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\nIn \"The House of Harper,\" written by J. Henry Harper, the following\r\npassage occurs: \"Curtis returned from the convention in company with\r\nyoung Theodore Roosevelt and they discussed the situation thoroughly on\r\ntheir trip to New York and came to the conclusion that it would be very\r\ndifficult to consistently support Blaine. Roosevelt, however, had a\r\nconference afterward with Senator Lodge and eventually fell in line\r\nbehind Blaine. Curtis came to our office and found that we were\r\nunanimously opposed to the support of Blaine, and with a hearty\r\ngood-will he trained his editorial guns on the 'Plumed Knight' of\r\nMulligan letter fame. His work was as effective and deadly as any fight\r\nhe ever conducted in the _Weekly_.\" This statement has no foundation\r\nwhatever in fact. I did not return from the convention in company with\r\nMr. Curtis. He went back to New York from the convention, whereas I\r\nwent to my ranch in North Dakota. No such conversation as that ever took\r\nplace between me and Mr. Curtis. In my presence, in speaking to a number\r\nof men at the time in Chicago, Mr. Curtis said: \"You younger men can,\r\nif you think right, refuse to support Mr. Blaine, but I am too old a\r\nRepublican, and have too long been associated with the party, to break\r\nwith it now.\" Not only did I never entertain after the convention, but\r\nI never during the convention or at any other time, entertained the\r\nintention alleged in the quotation in question. I discussed the whole\r\nsituation with Mr. Lodge before going to the convention, and we had made\r\nup our minds that if the nomination of Mr. Blaine was fairly made we\r\nwould with equal good faith support him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Theodore Roosevelt, by Theodore Roosevelt",
